“Third Uncle!” Hearing the voice, Kong Jinhu’s face lit up with joy. His gaze turned toward the middle-aged man standing in the sky.

At the same time, disciples from the Blue Dragon Sect and the Black Tortoise Sect also arrived in the sky. Upon seeing Luo Tian, their expressions changed instantly. They said nothing and stood motionless.

“Soul-Seeking Technique!” Luo Tian ignored everything, his eyes flashing with intense light. His gaze locked onto Kong Jinhu’s, as if staring into an endless abyss.

Kong Jinhu had no ability to resist. His body trembled, his face showing confusion, and his eyes became vacant.

“You dare to defy me, little brat!” Kong Xinghai, Third Uncle of Kong Jinhu, saw Luo Tian ignoring him and using the Soul-Seeking Technique on Kong Jinhu. His face darkened with murderous intent. With a flick of his hand, he summoned an ancient gray bell from Kong Xinghe’s grasp. The bell soared toward Luo Tian.

On the other side, Ke Shui Shi also displayed murderous intent. His body surged forward like a meteor, charging toward Luo Tian.

Ke Shui Shi and Kong Xinghai both clearly knew—everyone in the arena understood that this man was Luo Tian. Yet they also knew their relationship with Luo Tian had reached a point of mutual enmity. Killing Luo Tian would be an unparalleled achievement.

“Six-Origin Heaven Supreme!” The dozens of elders behind Luo Tian frowned, their gazes turning toward the two men in the sky.

If it were outside Hulao City, these twelve elders would have no fear against two Six-Origin Supremes. But within Hulao City, the disparity was staggering.

Luo Tian was currently using the Soul-Seeking Technique and could not fight. Thus, they had to shield him from attacks.

“Let’s fight! I don’t believe we twelve can’t withstand these two!” One elder shouted, watching the massive, humming ancient bell descending from above. His heart trembled.

“This damned thing—had we access to our origins, it would be different. Without them, we’re just stronger flesh,” another elder muttered bitterly but stood with the others waiting for the bell’s descent.

“Hmph, truly self-destructive,” Kong Xinghe sneered at the twelve elders blocking Luo Tian’s path.

“This is my first time shattering a dozen Six-Origin Supremes!” Kong Xinghe mused, imagining his own mighty image.

Seeing the twelve elders and Luo Tian together, Ke Shui Shi halted. He knew one strike from this bell would leave them severely wounded, if not dead.

“Elder Brother, should we save him? After all, Luo Tian’s relationship with our sect isn’t bad. The Black Tortoise Sect’s Ancestral Master once gifted him the Black Tortoise Ice Heart Array!” A middle-aged man with sharp eyebrows spoke to another calm-faced middle-aged man at the front of the Black Tortoise Sect’s group.

“No need. The Grand Master said Luo Tian is no ordinary person. These two Six-Origin Supremes can’t even touch him!” The man smiled.

“But here, he cannot use his origin. How will he face two Six-Origin Supremes who can?” The man who had spoken earlier frowned, puzzled by his elder brother’s calmness.

In an instant, Kong Xinghe’s ancient bell descended with overwhelming power. The immense pressure threatened to shatter the black earth beneath them.

[Chapter 814: Regaining Eight Origins]

The dozens of elders before Luo Tian grimaced, their fists clenched tightly as they awaited the bell’s strike.

In a flash, the bell crashed down. At the same time, Luo Tian’s eyes slowly opened. His gaze met the bell above him with a flicker of surprise before he softly said, “Move aside. Kill this boy!”

Luo Tian tossed the vacant-eyed Kong Jinhu before them, then stepped forward to stand in front of his companions.

“Dare you face my Xinyang Sealing Bell alone?” Kong Xinghe sneered, awaiting the sight of Luo Tian reduced to meat.

“This kid’s so confident. That’s Kong Xinghe’s Xinyang Bell! It was forged by absorbing sunlight on the day of maximum brightness each year, refined for forty-nine years to create this Xinyang Sealing Bell!” someone murmured.

“Due to absorbing countless light attributes, it can subdue all demons and spirits!” the Blue Dragon Sect’s disciples sighed, watching Luo Tian clench his fists.

Luo Tian’s eyes grew serious. His fists clenched tightly as the elders withdrew, leaving all of the Xinyang Bell’s pressure to be borne by him alone.

“Die!” Kong Xinghe roared, his hands forming seals as he pressed downward into the void.

The Xinyang Sealing Bell descended with a roar, like a blazing sun. A powerful purifying force struck Luo Tian’s soul.

“Boom…” The ground beneath Luo Tian exploded, sending stone slabs flying outward. His long hair swirled with the invisible waves.

Luo Tian straightened his bent body, exhaling a surge of green energy. A series of dragon roars echoed from his form as he launched a punch.

“Dong…” The thunderous bell sound rang in people’s ears. A terrifying shockwave erupted between Luo Tian and the Xinyang Bell, rising to the heavens. The gray clouds above churned violently, rain began to fall.

“Wum…” The sound collided with Hulao City’s walls, echoing back into people’s ears. Some界尊境 (Boundary-Transcending) disciples fell from the sky, their nostrils bleeding as they stared in shock.

In an instant, the Xinyang Bell flew backward. People could see countless intricate seals on it shatter instantly, scattering into the air.

Luo Tian’s legs sank into the black earth. His face showed shock, feeling his entire arm had become alien and numb. His chest felt constricted.

Suppressing the urge to vomit blood, he wore a serious expression. Without his origin energy, relying only on the Blue Dragon Sacred Body, he could barely match a Six-Origin Supreme.

Though slightly dissatisfied, Luo Tian stood unscathed, leaving everyone stunned.

“Nothing’s wrong!” Kong Xinghe was the first to be shocked. Due to his connection with the Xinyang Bell, he had been knocked back by Luo Tian’s punch. The immense counter-force also wounded him slightly. The Xinyang Bell had lost countless seals and chains, its power greatly diminished.

“This kid’s truly a monster! His physical strength alone is变态 (abnormal), no wonder he could withstand Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian, two Nine-Origin Sect Masters, and escape!” the Blue Dragon Sect’s leader sighed.

“I told you there was nothing wrong,” the middle-aged man from the Black Tortoise Sect said, satisfied as he spoke to his younger brother.

“Kill…” Luo Tian steadied his thoughts, advancing instead of retreating. His feet pushed off the ground like a raging dragon, charging toward Kong Xinghe with another calm punch.

Though Luo Tian had no origin energy, the immense pressure on his body made Kong Xinghe break out in cold sweat.

“This kid’s not human! Even without origin energy, he’s terrifying. Imagine what he’d be with it!” Kong Xinghe felt like he had eaten dirt, his six origin forces surging forward as he punched back.

The two punches collided. A thunderous roar echoed again. Two figures became like meteors, vanishing into the sky. Luo Tian crashed into the ground, creating a deep pit visible to all. Black dust obscured people’s vision.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed as Luo Tian emerged from the earth, his form somewhat disheveled.

Meanwhile, Kong Ming appeared in the sky with a grim face. His clothes were torn and ragged.

“Ke Shui Shi, are you going to watch? Let’s join forces to kill him!” Kong Xinghe, still shocked by Luo Tian’s strength, called out to Ke Shui Shi standing nearby.

“Good!” Ke Shui Shi nodded lightly. He didn’t feel ashamed about fighting two against one. His body shimmered, a red spear materializing in his hand.

Kong Xinghe also retrieved the Xinyang Bell, replacing it with a long knife. The two exchanged glances, their eyes filled with killing intent as they rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Two of them?” Luo Tian muttered, his spear, Lie Tian, flew into his hand with a hum.

“Dare to die!” Kong Xinghe and Ke Shui Shi sneered, mocking Luo Tian’s arrogance. They swung their weapons with overwhelming power, charging toward him.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed contemplation. He ignored their attacks, instead searching Kong Jinhu’s memories in his mind for a way to break free from Hulao Continent’s array.

The clashing sounds began. Only when they were close did Luo Tian raise his spear to block their attacks.

But now, Luo Tian was no longer composed. His body was in disarray. If not for his strong physique, he would have been annihilated by their first strike.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s body fell to the ground, his body emitting a series of thunderous sounds.

“They’re restoring origin energy. Stop him!” Ke Shui Shi and Kong Xinghe heard the thunderous sounds from Luo Tian’s body. Though they had pushed him back, neither felt joy. Their bodies surged forward like a flash of light toward Luo Tian.

“Dragon-Slaying Spear Technique!” Ke Shui Shi roared, his body moving with the spear. The long red spear expanded like a lightning bolt in the night, rushing toward Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, Kong Xinghe also unleashed his secret technique. His long knife cleaved through the sky, a crescent moon-like blade descending toward Luo Tian.

“Block one strike! End one strike!” Luo Tian’s gaze was deep. His body radiated green energy, forming a long dragon that rushed toward Kong Xinghe’s blade.

He punched forward. His green fist collided with the blade, sending him backward. His green body crashed into Hulao City’s wall.

In an instant, Ke Shui Shi’s spear followed. A gray dragon with a real dragon’s roar pierced Luo Tian’s chest.

“Three inches… two inches…” Cold energy pierced Luo Tian’s skin inch by inch. He could feel the destructive power within the spear tearing at his flesh and soul.

“One inch!” The spear finally stopped one inch from Luo Tian’s heart, causing his heart to freeze.

People saw this scene and their faces changed. The six-origin elders accompanying Luo Tian wore anxious expressions.

“Elder Brother, it seems this kid is done for!” The two from the Black Tortoise Sect whispered.

“He’s not dead yet. There’s still hope!” The middle-aged man who was asked frowned slightly, speaking softly. His origin energy had already gathered beneath his feet, waiting for the crucial moment to save Luo Tian. After all, Grand Master Chen Xuanning had ordered him to help Luo Tian. He hadn’t acted before because he wanted to test how strong Luo Tian truly was.

“Die…” As people were stunned, Ke Shui Shi’s face showed a grimace. He gathered his origin energy again, pushing the spear forward with all his might.

“Ke Brother, let him go!” The middle-aged man from the Black Tortoise Sect finally couldn’t bear it. His body became a flash of light, rushing toward Ke Shui Shi.

But the man had forgotten someone—Kong Xinghe. Kong Xinghe had been observing his movements and, sensing him moving, blocked his path instantly.

“Chen He Guang, stop!” Kong Xinghe roared. His knife slashed again, sealing Chen He Guang’s path completely.

“Damn it! I forgot about him!” Chen He Guang’s eyes showed regret, but he was blocked by Kong Xinghe.

In a flash, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with intense light. His face showed joy: “Found it!”

Before his voice finished, Luo Tian spat out a thread of refined blood. It formed strange seals and entered his chest.

At the same time, Ke Shui Shi’s spear halted. If it pierced another inch, it would pierce Luo Tian’s heart. At that point, even if he didn’t die, he’d be severely wounded.

“Boom boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed from Luo Tian’s body. His eyes showed amusement as he gazed at Ke Shui Shi, who was now close.

“One Origin… Five Origins… Eight Origins…” In a blink, Luo Tian’s cultivation returned to the Eight-Origin Supreme level.

“Unexpectedly, you two little rats forced me this far. How should I thank you two?” Luo Tian sneered, grabbing the spear embedded in his chest.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s face showed amusement as he pulled out Ke Shui Shi’s spear, blood splattering. A large amount of blood spewed from the wound on his chest.

But in an instant, the blood reversed direction as if controlled. It returned to Luo Tian’s body. The wound on his chest healed at an astonishing rate, and his aura gradually rose.

“Eight-Origin…” Ke Shui Shi and Kong Xinghe looked at Luo Tian with trembling expressions, seeing him return to the Eight-Origin Supreme level.

“Regained!” The dozens of elders accompanying Luo Tian also wore joy on their faces. They looked at the restored Luo Tian. As long as Luo Tian regained his cultivation, no one in this group could withstand his wrath.

“Flee!” Facing an Eight-Origin Supreme, Ke Shui Shi and Kong Xinghe had no will to fight. Moreover, Luo Tian could withstand Nine-Origin Supremes. They planned to escape while people were stunned.

“Let you flee?” Luo Tian sneered, throwing Ke Shui Shi’s spear. At the same time, his body vanished from the spot. In an instant, he appeared in front of Kong Xinghe and launched three punches.

“Boom…” The three punches landed, sending shockwaves. Kong Xinghe had no time to react. His body exploded into a cloud of blood under the astonished gazes of everyone.

Meanwhile, the spear sliced through space. It instantly reached Ke Shui Shi’s back and pierced his heart. Ke Shui Shi was pinned in place by the spear.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold light. He summoned a massive hand of origin energy, crushing Ke Shui Shi. He stood there coldly, his gaze finally landing on the Blue Dragon Sect’s people.

“Luo Tian, since you’ve killed two of them, don’t make more bloodshed!” Chen He Guang’s face showed pity.

On Hulao Star, their relationship wasn’t as tense as the four major sects outside. They were on the same side, jointly managing Hulao Star for many years. There was some sentiment between them.

Hearing Chen He Guang’s words, Luo Tian turned around and gazed at him. His gaze was deep: “Now, do you still say I am the jailbreakers?”

Luo Tian’s words were like a cold wind in everyone’s hearts. Though his gaze was on Chen He Guang, his voice carried icy tones.

Chen He Guang’s heart trembled. He stood motionless, as if submerged in a nine-abyss cold pool. He didn’t dare move an inch until Luo Tian’s gaze shifted, restoring a slight redness to his face.

“Respect the Hulao City Governor!” Chen He Guang’s face showed a touch of reverence as he bowed to Luo Tian.

As Chen He Guang bowed, the people behind him also showed respect and paid homage to Luo Tian.

“Since you’ve acknowledged me as the governor, I hope from now on, Hulao Star has only one voice—the voice of Luo Tian! Blue Dragon Sect people, you can leave!” Luo Tian sneered and spoke to the Blue Dragon Sect’s disciples.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Blue Dragon Sect’s disciples all sighed in relief. The previous Luo Tian was too terrifying, like an emperor. That soul-shaking震慑 (intimidation) made them have no will to resist, and they would die with just one word.

“Yes!” The leader of the Blue Dragon Sect bowed to Luo Tian. His gaze deeply looked at Chen He Guang, showing gratitude. If not for Chen He Guang’s plea, Luo Tian might have killed them.

Seeing the gratitude on the Blue Dragon Sect’s faces, Chen He Guang wore a bitter expression. His plea for the Blue Dragon Sect had already caused Luo Tian’s dissatisfaction. From Luo Tian’s icy gaze, Chen He Guang could sense his mercilessness.

“Life won’t be easy from now on,” Chen He Guang sighed inwardly, his face showing a bitter smile.

Luo Tian ignored Chen He Guang’s sorrowful gaze. He knew the Black Tortoise Sect people were kind-hearted and reluctant to kill, a trait he found incompatible. The reason he had been cold toward Chen He Guang and spoken those words was to intimidate and warn him. Before coming, Chen Xuanning had told Luo Tian that the people on Hulao Star could be temporarily mobilized.

“Wum…” Luo Tian flicked his finger. The myriad seals transformed into long dragons, swirling in the sky above people and rushing toward the dozens of elders behind him.

The elders wore expressions of excitement. They knew Luo Tian was lifting their seals and restoring them to Six-Origin level.

The dragons roared as they entered the elders’ bodies, filling them with joy.

“Lord Governor, we’ll take our leave!” The Blue Dragon Sect’s disciples showed reverence and spoke to Luo Tian. Behind them, about thirty thousand Blue Dragon Sect disciples stood in a large group.

“Go!” Luo Tian waved his hand impatiently, as if swatting flies. His voice was calm. He knew these people were respectfully obedient on the surface but secretly longed to see him dead.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Blue Dragon Sect disciples felt anger but dared not show it. They smiled and left Hulao Star in a large group.

“Um… Lord Governor, can we also leave?” An elder spoke, his voice trembling.

Although Ke Shui Shi and Kong Xinghe were dead, the two sects still had many people. Combined, they numbered about seventy thousand. Some had already left Hulao City, while others were exiting the city.

“Hmph, you guys?” Luo Tian’s gaze swept over the two sects and spoke to his dozen Six-Origin elders.

“Kill…” Luo Tian’s voice carried coldness, devoid of any emotional fluctuations.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the dozen elders wore sinister smiles. Their bodies shimmered as they rushed toward the Vermilion Bird Sect and White Tiger Sect people.

The dozen men charged like tigers from the mountain. Previously, their cultivation had been sealed, leaving them frustrated. Before, they were top-tier in their sects. Now, on Hulao Star, they had been surrounded by Boundary-Transcending disciples initially. Later, nearly pushed to the brink by two Six-Origin Supremes. This frustration had built up over time.

Now, with their cultivation restored, if not for Luo Tian’s command, they might have already attacked these people. Although it was Kong Xinghe and Ke Shui Shi who had made them suffer, to these dozen men, their subordinates deserved death.

Although the Vermilion Bird Sect and White Tiger Sect had tens of thousands on Hulao Star, most were Boundary-Transcending disciples. Only a few were Four or Five-Origin Supremes. They couldn’t match the dozen Six-Origin Supremes who had built up frustration.

In an instant, blood flowed through Hulao City and its surroundings. Scream after scream echoed into people’s ears.

Chen He Guang watched the screams, his face showing pity. His gaze turned to Luo Tian, but he met Luo Tian’s icy eyes and sighed deeply. He stood behind Luo Tian.

“Do you think I’m cruel?” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Chen He Guang. His heart sighed inwardly about the tradition of the Black Tortoise Sect—why were they all like this?

“Mm…” Chen He Guang nodded slightly, speaking honestly.

“I’ve heard about my battle with the Vermilion Bird Sect, right? If I don’t kill these people today, they’ll turn against my Tianyuan Sect in the future. When that happens, would they show mercy?” Luo Tian’s voice had no emotional fluctuations. He watched each person from the two sects fall, his eyes showing no compassion.

Chen He Guang knew Luo Tian’s words made sense. But as a Black Tortoise Sect disciple, he had been taught since joining the sect to show mercy. This belief was deeply rooted in every Black Tortoise Sect member.

The massacre continued, even spreading into Hulao City. The prisoners in the jail heard the commotion and became anxious. Some powerful prisoners felt their minds tremble, thinking a big figure had come to break them out. Others plotted to escape Hulao Star during the chaos.

The massacre lasted half a day before finally ending. The dozen elders, their bodies covered in blood energy, returned to Luo Tian’s side.

“Master, it’s all handled!” One elder bowed to Luo Tian and spoke softly, as if doing a trivial task.

“Let’s go in!” Luo Tian nodded slightly and led the dozen men into Hulao City.

Upon entering, Luo Tian and his group felt a heavy atmosphere. With the Blue Dragon Sect’s departure, Hulao City had become more open. The air was thick with blood.

At the city’s center stood a high wall, obscuring people’s view. The wall still had powerful array fluctuations, making Luo Tian sigh inwardly. This was the third major array he had seen since arriving on Hulao Star. Under such arrays, escaping was harder than climbing a mountain.

They walked through the streets under Chen He Guang’s guidance to the former Blue Dragon Sect’s location.

With the Blue Dragon Sect’s departure, Chen He Guang had arranged for White Tiger Sect disciples to tidy it up. It was temporarily designated as Luo Tian’s governor’s mansion.

“Tell me about Hulao City’s situation. After you finish, if you want to leave, wait until my Tianyuan Sect disciples arrive!” Luo Tian spoke directly, gazing at Chen He Guang.

Chen He Guang wore a bitter smile. Honestly, he really wanted to leave. But with Chen Xuanning’s orders, he could only stay in Hulao City and help Luo Tian.

[Chapter 815: Entering Hulao City]

“Hulao Prison, I suppose you already have a rough idea. It’s where the four holy star domain prisoners are held. There are about one million Boundary-Transcending prisoners, over a thousand Earth Supremes, and more than a hundred Heaven Supremes,” Chen He Guang spoke without delay, introducing Hulao City to Luo Tian.

Seeing Luo Tian remained silent, Chen He Guang continued: “Don’t underestimate these people. Though they are few in number, their combat power is terrifying—far stronger than a sect. One of them could easily defeat three equals!”

Hearing Chen He Guang’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with excitement. He knew these people were exactly what he needed.

“Though they are strong, they’re defiant and不服 (disobedient). If it weren’t for their lack of unity and the three arrays’ seals, we wouldn’t have been able to stop their rebellion!” Chen He Guang sighed as he continued introducing.

“Tell me about the factions within these prisoners. I don’t believe so many people wouldn’t form factions!” Luo Tian interrupted Chen He Guang after hearing some unimportant details.

“Lord Governor is truly wise. Inside the walls, there are twelve factions. Among them, three are the strongest because their leaders are all Seven-Origin Supremes!”

“The first is Tu Hongfei, a Seven-Origin Heaven Supreme. He was once a renowned figure in the Four Holy Star Domain. Later, he offended the Blue Dragon Sect and was chased for seven days and nights by three Seven-Origin Supremes, finally captured in Hulao Star!”

“The second is Ma Yingming. His situation was almost the same as Tu Hongfei’s. He offended the Vermilion Bird Sect and was captured in Hulao Star!”

“The third is different from the two. This person once caused a bloodbath across the Four Holy Star Domain, killing countless people. His name was Jin Jinglong, a Seven-Origin Heaven Supreme of the White Tiger Sect. Later, he apparently practiced a forbidden technique and massacred countless sects and continents. Finally, the White Tiger Sect placed him in Hulao Star!”

“According to his crimes, he should have been executed. But since he was a Seven-Origin Heaven Supreme of the White Tiger Sect and had some connection with Sect Master Jin Yongsi, he was placed in Hulao Star. His origin energy was sealed by the array to suppress his killing intent!” Chen He Guang finished explaining Hulao City’s factions. Luo Tian listened silently without interrupting.

“There is another faction within the prison, one that surpasses these three. To be precise, it’s not a faction but an individual! This person has only several subordinates. Yet he dominates Hulao Prison absolutely. Even we treat him with respect. Lord Governor must be cautious about this person!” Chen He Guang said, his expression showing admiration.

“Ah?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed interest. The dozen elders accompanying him also wore confusion, unable to imagine who else could make the four sects bow.

“This person is Nan Gong Yuqing! He entered Hulao Prison three years ago. But he wasn’t captured—he walked in himself!” Chen He Guang sighed, which caused Luo Tian’s heart to stir.

Nan Gong Yuqing. Luo Tian thought of the blood-covered youth who had helped him escape from the Sacred Realm outside. They had only exchanged a few words before parting. Luo Tian hadn’t expected Nan Gong Yuqing to be in Hulao Star.

Though there were many people with the same name in the Four Holy Star Domain, Luo Tian couldn’t imagine anyone else so powerful that even the four sects would bow to him.

“Who is this person? He’s not only strong but also seems to be free from Hulao Star’s constraints, able to enter and exit freely!” Luo Tian was deep in thought.

“Nan Gong Yuqing, an Eight-Origin Supreme. He forcibly entered Hulao Prison. This incident even alarmed the four sect masters, who came personally. But in the end, they could only let Nan Gong Yuqing enter Hulao Prison!”

“Don’t know who he is. He’s not bound by Hulao Star’s seals, and his origin energy isn’t suppressed! Fortunately, he remains low-key. After killing those who provoked him initially, no one dared to bother him!” Chen He Guang didn’t know what Luo Tian was thinking and continued his introduction.

“Interesting!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the city enclosed by barriers. His eyes showed anticipation.

“This Hulao Star definitely holds secrets no one knows. Otherwise, why would Nan Gong Yuqing waste time entering this prison? And that mysterious aura I felt is growing stronger!” Luo Tian muttered, issuing a series of commands.

Chen He Guang sighed deeply after speaking for so long. He had finally completed his explanation of Hulao Star’s situation.

“Senior Elder Wang, return to Tianyuan Sect and bring ten thousand Boundary-Transcending disciples here. With the other three sects gone, Hulao Star needs people to guard it!” Luo Tian spoke softly to one of the elders behind him.

“Yes!” The elder didn’t dare delay. He stepped out and vanished into the distance, flying toward Hulao Star’s exterior.

“Everyone rest a while. Tomorrow we’ll enter this legendary Hulao Prison!” Luo Tian spoke again, instructing the group. He then disappeared from the spot and appeared in the room Chen He Guang had prepared for him.

...

One night passed quietly. Before long, it was the next day.

With Luo Tian’s instructions from yesterday, the dozen Six-Origin elders and Chen He Guang gathered in the conference hall, waiting for Luo Tian’s appearance.

“You think the master will manage Hulao Star how? Will he take all of them under his command?” In their boredom, the dozen elders chatted. After yesterday’s events, these old men who had known each other before were closer.

“Probably,” one elder said with a sigh. Thinking of Luo Tian’s terrifying power and talent, he spoke confidently.

The dozen elders seemed to ignore Chen He Guang as they kept talking, making him sigh in bitterness.

“Hope Nan Gong Yuqing isn’t in Hulao Prison. Otherwise, these two would cause chaos. Who knows what trouble they’d stir up? Maybe even release all the prisoners, causing a big mess across the Four Holy Star Domain!” Chen He Guang sighed inwardly.

While people were chatting, Luo Tian’s figure slowly entered their sight. Seeing the crowd, he smiled: “Let’s go!”

Luo Tian said only two words before turning and heading toward Hulao Prison.

The group quickly reached the prison gates. Since the three sects had left, Tianyuan Sect’s disciples hadn’t arrived yet. All responsibilities on Hulao Star now fell to the Black Tortoise Sect’s disciples.

The prison gate guards naturally recognized Chen He Guang. As for Luo Tian, no one in Hulao City didn’t know him.

They faced no obstacles and entered Hulao Prison. The prison was like a small city, but movement was restricted. Except for designated times, prisoners couldn’t leave their quarters.

It was currently the time for prisoners to go out. Seeing the gates open, they all turned their gazes toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Chen He Guang, who is this young man?” A scarred man stepped forward from the crowd and asked Chen He Guang.

“This is Tu Hongfei!” Chen He Guang whispered to Luo Tian, smiling at Tu Hongfei.

“This is the new governor of Hulao City. From today, he controls everything on Hulao Star. All your lives and deaths are now in his hands!” Chen He Guang’s voice wasn’t loud, but it echoed throughout the prison.

“Boom…” Hearing Chen He Guang’s words, the crowd stirred. People gathered toward Luo Tian with curiosity.

“Wow, so young? Is he a bastard of Sha Cangmang or Jin Yongsi?” People laughed, seeing Luo Tian’s youthful face. These people were fearless and didn’t care about the four sects, otherwise they wouldn’t have been imprisoned.

“Hmph, I can feel this kid’s energy is strong. He must be good in that aspect!” Female prisoners also spoke, their eyes full of temptation as they gazed at Luo Tian. Some female disciples had seduced the guards and escaped Hulao Prison. This young man was obviously inexperienced, so these female prisoners were already eager.

“Hmph, a kid who hasn’t even grown hair can be governor? Where are Kong Xinghe, Ke Shui Shi, and Cui Changbin?” A man with fierce eyes stepped forward. His body radiated a bloodthirsty aura, like a wild beast.

“Two of them I killed. One I drove away!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the elder. When the man appeared, Chen He Guang’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind: “Jin Jinglong!”

“Hmph?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, people showed confusion. They thought Luo Tian was with the four sects. Otherwise, how could he control Hulao Star?

“My purpose here is to make you submit to me and lead you out of Hulao Star!” Luo Tian spoke calmly, getting straight to the point.

“Haha, who are you? Dare to say we should submit?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, people looked at him like a fool. Some rebellious prisoners stepped forward from the crowd and mocked loudly.

[Chapter 817: Battle with Jin Jinglong]

Luo Tian smiled, scanning the crowd. Seeing all three factions had arrived, he spoke softly: “Everyone is here.”
