“Wummm…” The massive seal emitted a piercing hum, and immediately after, the great seal vanished from Luo Tian’s grasp, appearing above Li Feihong without anyone knowing when.

Li Feihong had not expected Luo Tian to succeed, but by the time he realized it, there was no chance of escape. A terrifying aura pressed down upon him, leaving Li Feihong gasping for breath.

“Pang!” The great seal crashed down with a violent impact, sending a storm of dust into the sky. Gu Yun and Wang Pengfei, who had already escaped Li Feihong’s grasp, exchanged fearful glances at Luo Tian, silently thanking their stars that he had not targeted them.

The dust cleared, revealing Li Feihong—now at the Refining Body Sixth Rank—lying motionless in a pool of blood, his life hanging by a thread.

Luo Tian’s lips curled into a faint smile. “Li Xiuping, this is but the first step! I shall soon crush you beneath my feet!”

As they gazed upon Li Feihing’s lifeless form, a brief silence fell over the entrance of the Li family. A single thought echoed in all their minds: “The Li family, one of the three great clans of Tianyuan City, is finished!”

“Ah… you all must die!” A cold and sorrowful voice rang out, followed by the sudden appearance of several figures radiating an overwhelming aura.

Hearing the voice, Luo Tian’s heart tightened. His fists clenched, and a thin line of blood trickled down his palm as he gritted his teeth and growled, “Li Xiuping!”

Chapter Fourteen: Li Xiuping

“You all must die!” The cold voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

As the sound faded, several figures materialized before Li Feihong’s lifeless body. A young man clad in white robes cradled Li Feihong, his face etched with grief.

“Li Xiuping!” Luo Tian glared at the grieving youth, his heart swelling with a twisted sense of satisfaction. This man had ruined everything for him—now, even if he died here, it would be worth it.

“Did you think I’d let this slide? Regret, regret… you should have killed me when you had the chance!” Luo Tian sneered, mocking the man who had once looked down on him.

Li Xiuping’s eyes burned with hatred. He had dismissed Luo Tian as a worm, but now this so-called废物 had turned the tables.

“Wang Fan, subdue him! I shall reduce him to dust!” Li Xiuping ordered Wang Fan, while he himself rushed to tend to Li Feihong alongside an elderly man.

“Understood.” Wang Fan hesitated, his gaze lingering on Luo Tian, who was barely holding himself together. He recalled the day Luo Tian had been cast out of the sect, his eyes cold and his words mocking.

Wang Fan could not fathom how this waste—once so easily crushed—had grown into a force capable of toppling the Li family. How had he done it?

A cascade of questions filled Wang Fan’s mind, but for now, capturing Luo Tian was the priority. If he failed, Li Xiuping’s wrath would be unforgiving.

“Luo Tian, you truly are a surprise,” Wang Fan said coolly. “But your strength is gone. Surrender, and I’ll avoid making a mess.”

“Catch me if you can!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness as he produced two brown pills.

“Explosion Body Pills!” Wang Fan’s lips curled in disdain at Luo Tian’s foolishness.

Luo Tian was already weakened, having previously taken one Explosion Body Pill. Now, consuming two more would be a death sentence—his meridians could not withstand the strain.

Yet Luo Tian ignored the warning, swallowing the pills and immediately entering meditation to refine their power. Two Explosion Body Pills were no easy feat to master.

“Hmph. You think you can refine pills in front of me? A foolish dream,” Wang Fan sneered, his body flashing toward Luo Tian, whose face was flushed with red.

Wang Fan extended a crimson hand, aiming for Luo Tian’s dantian. A successful strike would have left even a fully powered Luo Tian crippled.

Gu Yun and Wang Pengfei watched in despair, their own bodies too weak to act. Gu Yun prayed desperately for the sect’s elders to intervene—otherwise, not only Luo Tian but even the Gu and Wang families would perish with Li Feihong.

“Pang!” A surge of fiery QI erupted.

“Dual-element body type!” Wang Fan’s disbelief was palpable. How could a city like Tianyuan harbor such a prodigy, one the Feiyun Sect had failed to notice?

“Qianxue!” Gu Yun’s face lit up as he saw Gu Qianxue standing before Luo Tian. At this moment, she was their only remaining force capable of fighting.

“Hmph. A dual-element prodigy? Even so, you’re only at Refining Body Fourth Rank. How dare you challenge me?” Wang Fan’s body radiated his Refining Body Fifth Rank power.

Though Gu Qianxue was a dual-element prodigy, she was at least one rank below Wang Fan. Soon, he overpowered her with a single strike of his Great Yang Palm, leaving her spitting blood.

Wang Fan approached Gu Qianxue, sighing inwardly at the loss of a potential prodigy. She would perish beneath his hand—a mid-tier disciple of Feiyun Sect.

No mercy, no compassion. Wang Fan raised his hand high and brought it down upon Gu Qianxue’s head.

“Roar!” At the last moment, a dragon’s cry echoed through the air, momentarily halting Wang Fan.

In that instant, a figure darted forward like the wind, striking Wang Fan with a fist wrapped in five colors of QI.

“Five Elements Body! Refining Body Fifth Rank!” Wang Fan trembled, staring at Luo Tian encircled by five QI dragons.

Luo Tian’s body radiated a Refining Body Fifth Rank aura, his strength unprecedented.

Wang Fan, lying on the ground, could not believe his eyes. He had never imagined Luo Tian would become a Five Elements Body.

Li Xiuping and the elderly man, who had been tending to Li Feihong, exchanged stunned glances. They could not fathom how Luo Tian had achieved this Five Elements Body.

Luo Tian felt an unprecedented surge of power, having successfully unleashed the hidden potency of his Dragon-Tiger Refining Pills through the Explosion Body Pills. He had ascended to Refining Body Fifth Rank.

Though still new to this rank, Luo Tian’s Five Elements Body was leagues beyond Wang Fan’s. A single punch sent the latter flying backward.

Wang Fan rose, wiping blood from his lips. “Hmph. A Five Elements Body? You’re only at Refining Body Fifth Rank.”

“But it’s enough to finish you!” Luo Tian sneered, his expression like that of a human beast as he lunged at Wang Fan.

“Hmph. You think I’m so easy to beat? Snow Rain Imperial Seal!” Wang Fan, unwilling to underestimate Luo Tian, unleashed his technique.

A deep red seal flew from Wang Fan’s hand, radiating waves as it hurtled toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smirked, his fists clenched but no technique unleashed. He let out a low growl and charged toward the crimson seal.

Seeing Luo Tian’s contempt, Wang Fan sneered. His technique was a mid-tier Yellow Rank skill—how could Luo Tian withstand it?

Gu Yun and Gu Qianxue, weakened but confident, watched Luo Tian. At Refining Body Fourth Rank, he had defeated Li Feihong at Sixth Rank with Explosion Body Pills. Now, facing a Fifth Rank opponent like Wang Fan was no challenge.

But Gu Yun’s thoughts turned to Li Xiuping and the elderly man, whose auras sent shivers through him. Their power was beyond comprehension.

As Gu Yun pondered, Luo Tian’s fist met Wang Fan’s Snow Rain Imperial Seal.

Chapter Fifteen: Two Young Men

“Pang…” The deafening sound echoed through the sky.

Wang Fan was stunned. His technique, which he had believed unshakable, had been shattered by Luo Tian’s bare hands. He could not fathom how this was possible.

Before he could react, Luo Tian became a blur of motion, appearing before Wang Fan. His QI-imbued fist struck Wang Fan’s dantian, while his other hand seized Wang Fan by the throat and lifted him.

“Luo… Luo Tian, what are you doing? You can’t kill me! I am a disciple of Feiyun Sect!” Wang Fan’s fear was palpable.

“Ah, Feiyun Sect. Well, I’m likely to die here anyway. Why not kill you as company?” Luo Tian sneered.

But before he could tighten his grip, an unprecedented pressure forced him to loosen his fingers.

“End of the line!” A man in white robes stood calmly, his face devoid of emotion. His voice was calm.

Those who knew Li Xiuping understood that his calmness meant fury beneath the surface. Only bloodshed could quell his rage—like the time a clan had angered him, and the next day, they were mysteriously wiped out.

“I never expected a worm to stir up such waves!” Li Xiuping’s voice was calm, but his aura radiated an overwhelming pressure.

Luo Tian’s face was drenched in sweat, yet he smiled. “Regret? What use is it now? I’m the one with nothing to lose—kill one, break even; kill two, profit. Clearly, I’m winning!”

“Hmph. Last time I let you live, it cost me dearly. This time, you must die!” Li Xiuping’s smile was chilling.

Luo Tian had never underestimated Li Xiuping, but he had not anticipated this man’s terrifying power and mind. His father’s death had left him calm, a feat Luo Tian could not match.

“You were once a worm. Now, you’re merely stronger,” Li Xiuping said coldly, his white robes fluttering without wind. His pale finger extended toward Luo Tian.

“Wummm…” Luo Tian felt as if he were sinking into a swamp, unable to move.

Sweat poured down his face. He had never imagined Li Xiuping could be this powerful—Luo Tian estimated he was at least Refining Body Eighth Rank.

Li Xiuping took two steps forward, and Luo Tian felt the surrounding QI chaos intensify. The pressure doubled.

As Luo Tian struggled to endure, Gu Yun hesitated before forcing himself up and shouting at the elderly man: “Feiyun Sect! Do you forget your rules? Sects must not interfere in clan affairs!”

“Hmph. Just a minor clan of Tianyuan City. How dare they meddle in Feiyun Sect’s matters? What are you, anyway?” The elder sneered.

“What do you think Feiyun Sect is? Just Refining Body Ninth Rank! How dare you be so arrogant?” A booming voice echoed, and the elder staggered backward, a line of blood trickling from his lips.

Under Li Xiuping’s aura, Luo Tian felt the pressure lift as he heard the voice.

Luo Tian panted heavily, his back soaked in sweat. He glanced at two figures approaching—tall and thin.

Li Xiuping’s gaze darkened as he spoke three words: “Bone-Refining Stage.”

The elder, who had been thrown back, showed no resentment but respect. Though he was a Feiyun Sect elder, the Bone-Refining Stage held no power here.

As people watched, the two figures approached, examining Luo Tian closely.

The crowd gasped—not at their cultivation but at their youth. Li Xiuping, a prodigy himself, felt humbled in their presence. One was broad-shouldered, his body radiating explosive power; the other wore black robes, exuding an icy aura.

“Is this our little brother? He doesn’t look very strong,” the broad-shouldered youth remarked, scrutinizing Luo Tian.

The black-clad youth also observed him, his cold gaze conveying a subtle kindness that surprised Luo Tian.

“Ah… I don’t know your business, but I’m Elder Shi Taiping of Feiyun Sect. Please don’t interfere with our affairs!” The elder interrupted the broad-shouldered youth, who had been talking nonstop.

“Get lost!” The youth snapped, unimpressed by the elder’s interruption. He waved his hand, and the elder was thrown back again.

“You!” The elder, accustomed to bullying others, could not bear the humiliation but was powerless against their strength.

“Two of you?” Luo Tian asked, bewildered. “What’s your business here?”

“Ahh, I forgot to introduce us! We’re your seniors. I’m Lei Yong, and this cold-hearted guy is Ji Chen. I’m your second senior, and he’s your third,” Lei Yong said with a grin.

“Senior… brothers?” Luo Tian was utterly confused. When had he ever taken a master?

Gu Yun’s heart, which had been in his throat, finally relaxed as he was assisted by a Gu family disciple to the three.

“Luo Tian, you do have a master. He just hasn’t shown up yet. I took you in at his request,” the elder said.

Luo Tian was still confused but understood—someone had taken him as a disciple without his knowledge.

Luo Tian’s frustration boiled over: “What the hell is this?”

“Ahh, it’s complicated. The old man said he has other matters and can’t appear now. You’ll have to ask him when you reach the Five Elements Sect!” Lei Yong waved dismissively.

Though his voice was low, everyone heard clearly. When the crowd heard “Five Elements Sect,” they looked at Lei Yong and Ji Chen with reverence.

The Feiyun elder nearly collapsed, while Li Xiuping’s calm demeanor vanished—though it quickly returned. No one knew what he was thinking.

Chapter Sixteen: Departure

The crowd could not help but be stunned. If Feiyun Sect was the dominant force in Tianyuan City and nearby cities, then the Five Elements Sect ruled the northern region of Tianyuan Continent. Few could rival it. Even Feiyun Sect would suffer greatly if the Five Elements Sect so much as blew a breath.

If these two young men killed them all and then strolled into Feiyun Sect’s gates, shouting, “I’ve killed your elders!” the sect’s leader would say nothing. After all, they were disciples of the Five Elements Sect.

“Are you two from the Five Elements Sect?” The Feiyun elder finally asked, unable to contain his curiosity.

“Little brother, these scum wanted to kill you?” Lei Yong turned to the elder, pointing at him and Li Xiuping.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, silently relieved that his life was spared.

“First meeting, and I’ve already captured them for you as a welcome gift. How will you deal with them?” Lei Yong kicked off the ground, dashing toward Elder Shi Taiping. Ji Chen transformed into a black mist, heading for Li Xiuping.

“You!” Elder Shi Taiping had not expected Lei Yong to attack so suddenly, leaving him unprepared. Before he could react, he was subdued and thrown at Luo Tian’s feet.

“Hmph. Shi Taiping—‘Shi’ means ‘excrement,’ and ‘Taiping’ means ‘peaceful.’ What a unique name!” Lei Yong mocked the elder’s name.

Li Xiuping, seeing the black mist approaching, narrowed his eyes and drew a long sword from his sleeve. He slashed at the mist with a powerful strike.

“Yellow Rank weapon!” Luo Tian was surprised. He had never seen a Yellow Rank weapon before, unsure of its strength.

The massive blade slashed toward Ji Chen, carving a deep gash in the ground.

Ji Chen’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he spoke coldly: “A frog in a well, overestimating itself!”

Seeing Luo Tian’s concern, Lei Yong chuckled: “Don’t worry. My third brother’s strength is beyond even me. Even a lowly Refining Body Eighth Rank cultivator like him would be no match. But I suspect he’s already decided to kill.”

Lei Yong was right. Though Li Xiuping was a prodigy, he was no match for Lei Yong and Ji Chen—two top-tier talents of the Five Elements Sect.

The blade slashed toward Ji Chen, but he stood unmoving.

“Mirage!” Li Xiuping realized too late. A cold aura rose behind him, and he could not resist as Ji Chen lifted him, subdued his cultivation, and threw him at Luo Tian’s feet alongside Elder Shi Taiping.

The crowd was stunned by the sudden turn of events. Li Xiuping, who had seemed unstoppable, now lay defeated—thanks to these two newcomers.

Luo Tian chuckled at Li Xiuping’s fallen state: “I never thought you’d end up like this.”

“I know you’ll let me go,” Li Xiuping shook his head, still calm despite his defeat.

Luo Tian’s heart burned with hatred. Li Xiuping was too clever, foreseeing that Luo Tian would not kill him but let him return. If he had killed Li Xiuping, a lingering guilt would haunt him, hindering his future cultivation.

“Leave. Tell Chen Yuting and the disciplinary elder that in half a year, I’ll return to Feiyun Sect to settle our score. I’ll personally defeat you then,” Luo Tian said coldly.

After speaking, he could no longer hold on and collapsed.

……

Tianyuan City had been controlled by the Li, Gu, and Wang families for thirty years. Yet no one could have predicted that the most powerful Li family would fall due to a single young man.

Luo Tian, once an unknown name in the city, had changed its balance within months.

At this moment, in a quiet courtyard of the Gu family, a youth stared at a broken spear tip. Beside him, a plump fat man fidgeted, hesitating to approach but unsure how.

“Sigh… Why does this Li family spear tip feel so strange? And why did the Chronological Scripture react when I found it?” Luo Tian muttered.

“Ugh, why are you still staring at this broken trinket? Give up! If it were valuable, Li Xiuping would have taken it already. What’s the point? Come on, my father wants to see you!” Gu Lei spoke loudly.

“Hmph, what’s wrong, Uncle Gu?” Luo Tian replied softly, his gaze leaving the spear tip to follow Gu Lei toward the hall.

The Gu family’s hall was filled with important figures waiting for Luo Tian’s arrival.

Gu Qianxue, the Gu family’s prodigy, stood beside Gu Yun. Her eyes unintentionally glanced outside—she didn’t know why, but a shadow had been lingering in her mind recently.

“Ah, my daughter’s heart has stirred! Action is better than hesitation!” Gu Yun teased.

Gu Qianxue’s face flushed slightly but quickly returned to composure as she asked, “Father, when will you tell me about my mother?”

Hearing her mention their mother, Gu Yun’s expression darkened. “Qianxue, I know you miss her. But I promised to tell you when you reach the Soul Refining Stage.”

“Hmph,” Gu Qianxue nodded faintly, her expression resolute.

Luo Tian and Gu Lei walked together toward the hall, their conversation light-hearted. When Luo Tian saw so many people, his face stiffened slightly.

Upon seeing Luo Tian arrive, the Gu family members showed respect. Without him, the Gu family might have already perished.

“Uncle, what did you need me for?” Luo Tian smiled warmly and greeted Gu Qianxue. He was grateful for her sacrifice in protecting him.

“Hmph, I called you to discuss your departure for the Five Elements Sect. The first of next month is approaching—have you recovered enough?” Gu Yun smiled.

Luo Tian sighed in relief, his expression hopeful: “Hmph, I’m fine now. It’s time to meet my unknown master! I suspect the Five Elements Sect will be full of surprises!”

Chapter Seventeen: Xuantian City

Xuantian City, located in the eastern part of Dahan Forest, was larger than Tianyuan City but ruled solely by the Zhang family.

Zhang Xuantian, Xuantian City’s ruler, was at Refining Body Eighth Rank. No cultivator dared to cause trouble in Xuantian City, and the city was most famous for its Xuantian Auction.

Xuantian City held an auction annually, renowned across the northern region. Every year, countless experts attended to bid on treasures they desired.

At this moment, two men and a woman strolled along Xuantian City’s wide streets. The woman had her hair tied high, her face exquisite, drawing attention from passersby. But when their eyes fell on the plump fat man beside her, interest vanished.

Though the fat man wasn’t unattractive, he looked out of place beside the girl.

The other youth wore simple clothes, his body devoid of any QI aura. A pale green jade pendant hung from his waist, glowing softly. If someone recognized it, they would be shocked—such a large jade pendant made from a rare “Nourishing Heart Jade” was beyond commoners.

A millet-sized Nourishing Heart Jade could sustain an ordinary family for a lifetime. A youth wearing such a pendant must have a special background.

“My god, we’ve finally arrived at Xuantian City! I’m exhausted! Luo Tian, sister, let’s find a place to stay first!” Gu Lei groaned, complaining to Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue.

Gu Qianxue wiped her forehead, clearly exhausted from the journey.

Luo Tian nodded slightly, and the three found a clean inn to stay in. They then sought out a good restaurant for a meal. As the Gu family, known as one of Tianyuan City’s three great clans, they were wealthy and skilled in alchemy. Naturally, they had no shortage of money. Soon, a table full of delicious dishes was served.

Gu Lei devoured his food hungrily, while Gu Qianxue was more refined. Luo Tian sipped a cup of wine, his consciousness extending outward to listen for news about the Xuantian Auction.

“Did you hear? This auction will feature an Upper Rank technique! Other city lords have already arrived. I heard there’s also a Taiyin Nourishing Root Grass for sale!” Luo Tian overheard people discussing, his eyes widening.

Luo Tian wasn’t interested in the Upper Rank technique but was intrigued by the Taiyin Nourishing Root Grass. The second page of the Chronological Scripture’s “Herbs and Plants” section described a third-grade medicine called Nourishing Root Pills, whose main ingredient was the Taiyin Nourishing Root Grass.

By processing it and applying it to his body, one could refine their physique. The Nourishing Root Pills were an upgraded version—refining both body and internal organs, removing impurities.

“If conditions allow, I could buy this Taiyin Nourishing Root Grass. If I refine my body further, who knows how much stronger it would become!” Luo Tian muttered.

As he listened to the chatter, an arrogant voice echoed in: “I’m here to eat. All others must leave immediately!”

The noisy crowd fell silent instantly. Those who knew the situation quickly left their seats.

“Brother, hurry up and leave! Zhang Qi is here!” A middle-aged man warned Luo Tian’s group.

Luo Tian and the others heard the arrogant voice but frowned. Gu Lei muttered a curse, while Gu Qianxue merely furrowed her brow and continued eating.

Soon, most people left their seats, leaving only a few tables—among them, Luo Tian’s. He noticed one table with three people dressed in black robes, each bearing a crescent moon emblem on their chest. The crescents varied in fullness.

“Hmph. There are still people who don’t know their place! I’m here to eat, and you dare to block me? Get out of my way!” A young man around twenty strode in, his gait slightly unsteady—evidently a spoiled brat indulged in luxury.

Zhang Qi’s voice echoed, and he surveyed the room. His gaze fell on Luo Tian’s table, where his eyes locked onto Gu Qianxue.

Zhang Qi had seen countless women but never one so alluring. He exclaimed his luck and approached Luo Tian’s group. His entourage moved toward the remaining tables.

“Beauty, why are you eating alone? I’m Zhang Qi. My father is the city’s ruler. May I have the honor of joining you for a meal?” Zhang Qi struck a pose he considered handsome and sat beside Luo Tian.

“Vomit…” Gu Lei, who had just taken a bite of meat, spat it out upon seeing Zhang Qi’s appearance.

“Get lost…” Gu Qianxue’s cold voice echoed, and a fierce aura radiated from her.

Though Zhang Qi was the city’s ruler’s son, his cultivation was far below Gu Qianxue. At twenty, he was only at Refining Body Second Rank—his strength built entirely on pills. He could not withstand Gu Qianxue’s aura and was pushed back several steps.

Zhang Qi had grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth, enjoying every luxury under his father’s protection. He had never faced any harm before.

Seeing Gu Qianxue’s insolence, Zhang Qi’s eyes darkened: “Hmph. You’re ungrateful! What good is Refining Body Fourth Rank? Capture this little woman for me!”

Zhang Qi’s group of Refining Body Fourth Rank guards, seeing their master’s command and noting that Luo Tian’s strongest was Gu Qianxue, ignored the fat man (who had no QI aura) and advanced toward them.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly, thinking the saying “beauty brings disaster” was true. He stood up to prepare for a fight.

“Get lost…” As Luo Tian prepared to act, another authoritative voice echoed, followed by a scream.

Zhang Qi had already been certain of victory but turned to see the most horrifying sight: a Refining Body Fourth Rank guard exploded, his body and bones torn apart in a gush of blood.

Though Zhang Qi was slightly farther away, he still felt the impact—his face was smeared with a red substance.

Chapter Eighteen: Escape

“Ah!” Zhang Qi stood frozen, the entire restaurant falling silent for a moment. Soon, he screamed and fled, no longer caring about flirting with Gu Qianxue.

The guards, seeing their master flee, saw the three black-cloaked figures as demons and rushed after Zhang Qi.

Gu Lei’s stomach churned, and others vomited, the连锁 reaction leaving even Luo Tian and the three black-cloaked figures untouched.

Even Gu Qianxue, usually cold and aloof, vomited in embarrassment.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened at the three still eating. A sense of danger surged within him.

Since meeting his second and third seniors, Luo Tian had known that various strange body types existed on the Tianyuan Continent. His second senior was a lightning-type body, while his third was rare—darkness-type.

But he could not decipher the three’s body types, nor their mysterious nature. Their casual killing was even more chilling.

The three glanced at Luo Tian, and the latter felt a wave of terror.

The Chronological Scripture, which had been silent for so long, suddenly glowed with golden light. Luo Tian struggled to suppress it but failed.

Just as he was about to lose control, his jade pendant glowed green, and the Scripture calmed.

Though stunned, Luo Tian remained calm outwardly. Without regard for propriety, he grabbed Gu Lei with one hand and Gu Qianxue with the other, rushing downstairs as if fleeing Zhang Qi’s return.

They reached the inn and checked with his consciousness, finding no one following them. He released them and entered the room, his mind heavy with questions: “Who are these three? Why did they trigger the Scripture’s reaction? Who is my mysterious master? And why does this jade pendant, given by my senior, not only hide my cultivation but also suppress the Scripture?”

As Luo Tian muttered, a commotion echoed outside. Gu Lei’s anxious voice rang out: “Luo Tian, my sister is fighting with Xuantian City!”

Hearing this, Luo Tian frowned. He had no desire to clash with the Zhang family of Xuantian City—Zhang Xuantian was at Refining Body Eighth Rank, stronger than Li Xiuyuan but still far beyond his current strength.

“Hmph. I didn’t want to escalate things, but now that they’ve attacked us, there’s no choice. Since Gu Qianxue could withstand the Zhang family’s attack, it means their ruler hasn’t come,” Luo Tian mused as he stepped outside.

Gu Qianxue was surrounded by Refining Body Fourth Rank warriors, while Gu Lei had already informed Luo Tian and stood before her. Opposite them was Zhang Qi, the city’s prince-like figure.

“Haha, little beauty, I forgot about you earlier. But it’s not too late! As long as you’re in Xuantian City, you’ll never escape my grasp!” Zhang Qi sneered.

“Oh? Then we won’t run this time,” Luo Tian said calmly, stepping beside Gu Qianxue.

Seeing Luo Tian approach and noting his lack of QI aura, Zhang Qi sneered: “Little beauty, why do you surround yourself with such waste? Your companion is even a commoner! Hmph. I thought you had poor taste.”

Hearing Zhang Qi’s words, Gu Qianxue blushed inexplicably. But seeing Luo Tian arrive, she knew she wouldn’t have to fight. She despised Zhang Qi deeply; if it were in Tianyuan City, she would have torn his mouth apart.

“Smack!” A clear slap echoed as Zhang Qi was thrown backward, coughing up blood and staring at Luo Tian in disbelief.
