“Luo Tian, these two are my juniors. I hope you'll grant me a slight favor and let them go this time. If they do it again, I won't be responsible!” Xuanyuan Qiong spoke softly, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Blasphemy! You've already let them go. What's the point of talking about granting me a slight favor?” Though Xuanyuan Qiong was powerful, Zheng Xin and Diao Dezhu were all fearless individuals. Moreover, their backing included the Four Sacred Star Domains, the Beast Domain, and three great masters—Gu Tianyu.

“My brother was killed by them. This matter won't end peacefully. And if they survive, they'll definitely retaliate against us. If anything happens to those around me, I can't afford it!” Luo Tian's gaze met Xuanyuan Qiong’s, his expression cold. Clearly dissatisfied with Xuanyuan Qiong's actions.

“I can protect the Four Sacred Star Domains for a century. After that, when the great battle with the Ancient Royal Clan begins, the configuration of the Nine Domains will surely change. And within a century, your people will have fully matured!” Xuanyuan Qiong spoke with sincerity, explaining his compensation.

“Fine. This one time only. But the next time, I'll avenge my brother!” Luo Tian's face still bore no smile, and he did not accept Xuanyuan Qiong’s gratitude.

At that moment, as Luo Tian and his companions stood beneath the stars, a figure in golden robes emerged from the Divine Clan's sacred mountain. His gaze turned toward Luo Tian’s group, and his golden eyes flashed with intense hatred.

“Luo Tian, wait. One day I'll strip your soul and skin you alive, making you suffer to death in my hands!” The golden figure vanished into the sacred mountain and plunged into the void.

“Hmph?” As Luo Tian conversed with Xuanyuan Qiong, his brows furrowed slightly. Suddenly, a chill swept through his heart, and he swiftly turned his gaze toward the direction of the Divine Clan's continent.

“Who…” Luo Tian roared into the stars, unleashing his vast spiritual awareness. Yet nothing was found.

“Why did I suddenly feel a sense of danger?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, murmuring to himself. At their level of cultivation, they had a natural instinct for danger.

“What's wrong?” Xuanyuan Qiong’s face showed slight confusion. Even he hadn’t noticed anyone leaving.

“Nothing,” Luo Tian lightly shook his head, then turned to Xuanyuan Qiong and said softly: “What's your next move? Will you continue wandering through the domains, or stay within the Divine and Demon Domain?”

“I'll go to the Four Sacred Star Domains to fulfill my promise. As for matters in the Divine and Demon Domain, I believe you'll handle them well!” Xuanyuan Qiong smiled slightly, gazing at Luo Tian before stepping into the void.

“Rest assured about the Four Sacred Star Domains’ safety. If danger arises, I'll intervene!” Xuanyuan Qiong's voice echoed in the void before vanishing from sight.

“Wait until I become a准纪元之主, and we'll fight again!” Yao Chen roared into the void, his eyes resolute.

“Let's go check the Divine Clan. Where is Zhan Biao… still alive?” Luo Tian’s eyes carried a hint of sorrow as he addressed his companions.

“Hmm…” Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Xu Liyi and the others fell silent. Among them, he had the deepest bond with Chen Zhanbiao. A profound sorrow spread beneath the stars.

“If Zhan Biao is dead, let the entire Divine Clan pay for his life with their deaths!” Xu Liyi spoke softly, his voice laced with immense killing intent.

“Ziyi, don’t be reckless!” Luo Tian sighed softly. He wasn’t a bloodthirsty person. He knew Xu Liyi’s words were driven by anger, and they couldn’t annihilate the entire Divine Clan unless the clan itself launched an attack on the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Hum…” As they spoke, their spiritual energy surged as they landed on the Divine Clan’s vast sacred mountain. Their gazes were cold, scanning the Divine Clan members.

“Who among you can take responsibility and speak?” Luo Tian’s gaze was cold, his voice laced with chill.

At that moment, the Divine Clan members had no pride left. They were like wilted cabbages after their leaders were driven away, and even the Epoch-level elders had been killed. They dared not act boldly.

“Luo… Lord Luo, what are your commands?” An elder stepped forward from the crowd. His cultivation was at the late Epoch stage, but he was currently the highest among the Divine Clan members.

“Where are Sun Shengtian and Sun Miechen? Also, have you captured a strong young man in the past two days?” Luo Tian didn’t waste words but directly asked his question.

“Lord Luo, the sons of two Epoch Lords did capture a young man. That was Chen Zhanbiao, imprisoned in the Soul Prison by them!” The elder replied tremblingly.

“As for the old Divine King and the new Divine King, we don’t know their whereabouts!” The elder’s voice trembled; Luo Tian and his companions’ pressure was too great.

“Zhanbiao is still alive!” Upon hearing the elder’s words, Luo Tian and his companions’ faces lit up with joy. Their hearts sighed in relief.

“Alive is good. You should be grateful he’s alive!” Xu Liyi’s eyes regained a touch of clarity, his gaze sweeping over the Divine Clan members.

Xu Liyi’s words made the Divine Clan tremble instinctively, their hatred for Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuji deepened.

Sun Miechen and Sun Shengtian’s whereabouts were unknown. They had no choice but to entrust the Divine Clan to Sun Zhangyang, as he was the son of an Epoch Lord. His strength and prestige were undeniable, and he had indeed brought great benefits to the Divine Clan—like gathering nearly half of the Beast Clan’s strength.

Yet the Divine Clan never expected Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuji to dare challenge even the Four Sacred Star Domains or Luo Tian.

“Take us to the Soul Prison!” Luo Tian didn’t waste words but directly ordered the elder. He couldn’t rest until he saw Chen Zhanbiao.

“This, Lord Luo, we can lead you there. But the key to the Soul Prison is with Sun Zhangyang.” The elder’s face was filled with reverence, carefully watching Luo Tian and Xu Liyi.

“What? Say that again!” Upon hearing the elder’s words, Zheng Xin and others’ moods, which had just improved, darkened again. The Divine Clan elder nearly fell to his knees in fear.

“Let’s first go see the Soul Prison you mentioned!” Luo Tian sighed softly, addressing the elder.

“Yes!” The elder dared not delay. He quickly rose, his gaze filled with reverence as he led Luo Tian and the others toward the back of the sacred mountain.

Not long after, under the elder’s guidance, Luo Tian and his companions arrived at the prison where the Divine Clan incarcerated those who committed heinous crimes. Their expressions darkened immediately.

Chapter 1567: The Soul Prison

Golden gates appeared in Luo Tian’s view. The gate was inscribed with flowing seals, as if sealed. This made Luo Tian’s brows furrow.

“This prison for the Divine Clan's criminals is truly solid!” Zheng Xin couldn’t help but curse, looking at the Soul Prison. It was clearly not something ordinary people could create.

“This Soul Prison wasn’t crafted by our Divine Clan’s Epoch Lord. However, it was created by several near-epoch-level masters during the peak of our clan. They personally cast a seal. Even with near-epoch-level strength, escaping from the Soul Prison would be extremely difficult!” The elder spoke with pride.

“Smack…” Before the elder could finish speaking, Xu Liyi slapped him across the face.

“Even now, you’re still boasting? Hurry up and tell us how to open this seal!” Xu Liyi shouted, his gaze fierce as he stared at the elder.

“Only the key can open it. Alternatively, a strike surpassing near-epoch-level strength could break it. However, if you do that, the prisoners inside might be in danger!” The elder, dazed from Xu Liyi’s slap, still answered tremblingly. Who was he to defy them now?

“We have an Epoch Treasure with power comparable to an Epoch Lord’s strike. Just one hit and the door would be open!” Diao Dezhu sneered, his gaze on the sealed gates.

“Idiot! Didn’t you hear him? If we force it open, the prisoners inside might be in danger. I don’t care about others, but if Zhanbiao is harmed, I’ll rip out your teeth!” Xu Liyi exploded at Diao Dezhu’s words.

“Then what do we do? Sun Zhangyang must have run far away. Where are we supposed to find him?” Diao Dezhu replied.

“Let’s fetch Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan. They have some knowledge of formations; maybe they can find a way to break this gate!” Luo Tian spoke, stopping the two from arguing.

“Dog, you’re fast. Go again!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the group’s eyes lit up, turning to Diao Dezhu.

“Damn it, I already went once. Zheng Xin’s speed isn’t much slower than mine. Let him go!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes showed discontent, shifting the topic to Zheng Xin.

“Dog, I’m not as fast as you!”

“We’ve had competitions before. Let me tell you…” Zheng Xin, hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, was unamused and started talking endlessly.

“Stop…” Hearing the group stir up again, Luo Tian’s head throbbed from his previous injuries.

“You two go together!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, and the group unanimously agreed.

Under the threat of the group, Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin left with reluctant expressions, their figures vanishing from the Divine Clan’s sacred mountain.

“Let’s rest a while,” Luo Tian then addressed Yao Chen and Li Tianzhi, who had all suffered varying degrees of injury and needed recovery.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Divine Clan elder naturally treated them like ancestors. They feared these people would annihilate the Divine Clan if angered, even though their sacred mountain was formidable. However, they couldn’t move certain things; only the Divine Kings could.

The elder prepared a luxurious hall for Luo Tian and his companions to rest, while Luo Tian ordered the Divine Clan to continue repairing their continent. After all, the Divine Clan still existed, and Sun Miechen and Elder King Sun Shengtian might still be alive.

As Luo Tian’s group recovered, the Divine Clan fell into a brief calm. With prior experience in rebuilding their continent, they did so methodically.

However, the news of Luo Tian’s group attacking the Divine Clan spread across the Nine Domains. The top-tier talents from the Four Sacred Star Domains and Beast Domain had jointly attacked the Divine Clan, using an Epoch Treasure. The sons of the Divine Clan’s Epoch Lord and Beast Clan’s Epoch Lord, Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuji, had fled with the strength of both clans. Eight Epoch-level masters were slain in this terrifying feat, shaking the Nine Domains completely.

The Four Sacred Star Domains had grown from a domain with no one reaching the Saint Stage to now clashing against the Divine Clan. Simply by their strength, they had defeated the once-mighty Divine Clan. This was enough to shock everyone.

The Four Sacred Star Domains, aside from the Ancient Royal Clan’s full emergence, had no other forces capable of matching them. And all this was because of one person—a prodigy who had emerged from the ordinary Tianyuan Continent. Luo Tian.

When Luo Tian first stepped out of the Tianyuan Continent, he was still a boy under a hundred years old. Now, he had become the peak power of the Nine Domains. The Beast Clan and Fire Domain’s forces were deeply connected to Luo Tian, making him a legend in himself.

Just like every Epoch Lord’s youth, he was dazzlingly brilliant. Especially in this great era where the sons of ancient kings and Epoch Lords had all emerged, to shine so brightly in this age was proof enough of Luo Tian’s extraordinary nature.

“If there is indeed a path to enlightenment in this epoch, it must be Luo Tian!” The people of the Nine Domains all felt this way.

Not only did humans tremble, but even the Ancient Beasts received news and were shocked by Luo Tian’s power.

“After a century, we must attack the human domain. Otherwise, this child will surely become a major threat, like the previous Epoch Lords who suppressed us!” A near-epoch-level master of the Ancient Royal Clan spoke.

“Strive to cultivate!” The heirs and prodigies of the Ancient Royal Clan all showed determination. Though they had been suppressed by Luo Tian, their desire to compete never faded.

Luo Tian and his companions didn’t care about what people thought. Under the recovery of medicinal pills, they were able to move within a day, even if not fully recovered.

“Haha! Come on, Yao Chen. I’ll self-impose a cultivation restriction. Who can fight me!” As soon as he recovered slightly, Yao Chen was lively and sought out the Divine Clan members for a duel.

“Great opportunity! I’ve come to the Divine Clan’s ancestral mausoleums!” Sun Kemin’s face glowed with greed. This was his first time entering the Divine Clan openly.

Previously, Sun Kemin had once entered the Divine Clan’s ancestral mausoleums but was chased mercilessly. Now, with such a good opportunity, he couldn’t miss it. Sun Kemin led Xu Liyi and Ren Hongzhe into the Divine Clan’s ancestral mausoleums.

In an instant, the entire Divine Clan was in chaos. The Divine Clan members dared to be angry but couldn’t speak out. Each of them was like a master, especially when Sun Kemin opened the mausoleum with special methods and took out its treasures. The Divine Clan members’ eyes turned red.

The Divine Clan, a holy clan of the Nine Domains, had never suffered such humiliation. In the past, people wouldn’t even dare to imagine it. But now, it was happening before their eyes, making them hate Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuji even more. They had brought these fierce stars to the Divine Clan, then fled shamefully and took away the Epoch Treasures.

“Ah… my Divine Clan’s Epoch Lord, if you have a soul, please make these fierce stars leave quickly!” All the Divine Clan members silently cried out.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, slowly stood up, and gazed at the Divine Clan members. He knew that the Beast Clan might now decline, especially the Divine Clan.

After the previous battle, the Divine Clan’s Epoch-level masters had either died or fled. The entire Divine Clan now had no Epoch-level master. In this era, a holy clan without an Epoch-level master had no self-defense capability.

Time flowed slowly. A day passed, and four figures finally appeared at the Divine Clan’s sacred mountain. They were Diao Dezhu, Zheng Xin, and the two they had fetched—Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong.

The four landed on the sacred mountain, approached Luo Tian waiting there, greeted him, and then headed straight for the Soul Prison.

“How is it?” Luo Tian’s face was serious as he addressed Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong.

“Not much chance. Let us study it!” The two replied, then ignored Luo Tian and began carefully examining the Soul Prison’s gate.

“Wait,” Luo Tian wore a slight smile. Though anxious, the four had returned with good news: Chen Zhanbiao’s soul lamp was still lit, albeit faintly. This proved he hadn’t died.

Luo Tian and Sun Mengru returned to the previous hall for recovery, while Sun Kemin and Yao Chen continued their “work.”

“Strange. Previously, Nan Gong and Ren Hongzhe said the one who killed him was three people. But why hasn’t the soul-binding master appeared when we attacked the Divine Clan?” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze deepening.

The soul-binding master—this terrifying enemy had never left Luo Tian’s mind. It still lurked in the shadows, like a venomous snake. He had no clues now.

“Haha! Luo Tian, guess what we found!” As Luo Tian pondered, a loud laugh echoed from outside the hall. Diao Dezhu and others entered with joy.

“What good thing?” Luo Tian’s face showed curiosity. These people had high standards now; if it wasn’t something good, they wouldn’t be so excited.

“Piercing Heart Ice… it’s Piercing Heart Ice! One of the main ingredients for Soul-Eating Pills!” Zheng Xin couldn’t hide anything. Before anyone spoke, he launched into a continuous explanation like firecrackers.

“What!” Upon hearing Zheng Xin’s words, Luo Tian slowly stood up, his face also showing joy. He hadn’t expected to find Piercing Heart Ice in the Divine Clan.

Chapter 1568: The Ancestral Mausoleum

“Where is it? Give it to me!” Luo Tian’s face also showed joy, his gaze on them. He hadn’t expected to encounter a sacred medicine for Soul-Eating Pills here.

“This…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Diao Dezhu and others’ faces slightly changed, becoming awkward. They looked at Luo Tian.

“This… that mausoleum was of a near-epoch-level master. It’s quite tricky! We couldn’t open it!” Diao Dezhu and others spoke softly.

“What?” Upon hearing their words, Luo Tian’s face showed disbelief. If Diao Dezhu and others couldn’t enter, that was fine. But he didn’t think Sun Kemin would be unable to enter the mausoleum of a near-epoch-level master. After all, Diao Dezhu could even open the burial coffin of a saint. How could he be stopped by a simple near-epoch-level mausoleum?

“Where is Sun Kemin?” Then Luo Tian noticed Sun Kemin wasn’t there, his face showing confusion.

“He said he’d study it more. He told us to find you!” Zheng Xin spoke, his gaze on Luo Tian, sensing something was off.

“Damn it! That mausoleum must have something good inside. Not only is there Piercing Heart Ice, but there’s definitely other things. That bastard wants to hoard it!” Then Luo Tian gritted his teeth and flew off toward the Divine Clan’s mausoleums.

“Sun Kemin, bastard! He tricked us!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin also became furious.

They rushed out of the hall with anger, following Luo Tian’s steps. They instantly appeared in the Divine Clan’s mausoleum garden.

A large tomb appeared in Luo Tian’s view. Each tomb radiated a terrifying aura that made people shudder.

But some of the tombs had something like dog holes, which spoiled the sacred appearance of the mausoleum.

“That’s it! That bastard really went in!” Diao Dezhu and others pointed at a tomb, glaring at the entrance. A hole appeared there, emitting golden light.

“Let’s go! I’ll see what’s inside that made this bastard do this!”

“Yes, if I see this bastard, I’ll rip his skin off!” They shouted and entered the tomb.

The Divine Clan members could only endure their anger, watching Luo Tian’s group enter without saying a word.

As soon as they entered the tomb, a series of thunderous sounds echoed in their ears. They seemed to have entered a grand hall, and within it, a figure wrapped in golden light clashed with another.

“Who are you people? Daring to disrupt our Divine Clan!” A deep voice echoed in the hall, followed by continuous thunderous sounds.

“A near-epoch-level puppet!” Soon after, Luo Tian and his group recognized who the two fighting were. One was Sun Kemin, who had entered first, and the other was a puppet-like entity. Though it was a puppet, they could feel immense pressure from it.

“This puppet is priceless!” Zheng Xin couldn’t help but gasp. If they could refine this puppet, it would be a护身符. Except for an actual near-epoch-level master’s attack, having such a puppet would let them walk through the Nine Domains with impunity.

“Indeed, the Divine Clan’s mausoleums have good things. That’s why Sun Kemin wanted to send us away—so he could hoard it!” Zheng Xin and others showed anger.

“Every holy clan must have its depth. However, no one has received the inheritance. If all these Divine Clan mausoleums were opened and inherited, even without an epoch-level master, the Divine Clan would still be the top holy clan in the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian murmured.

“It’s impossible. Like my Dragon Clan’s dragon mausoleums, they can’t all be opened. They wait for the right person, like how my brother obtained the Dragon Roar inheritance before. Without opportunity, you can’t obtain it!” Long Jie spoke.

“Yes, we’ve excavated over a dozen Divine Clan mausoleums. But half were because the mausoleums didn’t allow non-Divine Clan members to obtain them. Two were because the opportunity wasn’t enough, and we couldn’t get it!” Diao Dezhu also spoke, his gaze filled with a touch of admiration.

“This tomb is the mausoleum of a Divine Clan master named War King. War King was skilled in puppetry and had once crafted eight epoch-level puppets. This near-epoch-level puppet was the one War King spent his life to refine!” Long Jie smiled, gazing at the tomb’s wall with a brief introduction of its owner.

“War King loved battle throughout his life. Thus, during War King’s reign over the Divine Clan, the entire clan was influenced by him and constantly fought against other holy clans. Though he never conquered a holy clan, his name became legendary!” Luo Tian and others observed the inscriptions on the hall’s walls, their eyes filled with admiration.

“Obtaining War King’s inheritance requires defeating this near-epoch-level puppet!” Zheng Xin spoke, his eyes glowing.

“Simple and brutal. He acted decisively!” Luo Tian and others observed War King’s description, forming an evaluation of this War King.

“Boom…” As they marveled, Sun Kemin’s battered figure flew back and landed at their feet.

“Ah ah ah! Sun Kemin, you don’t need to show me such respect!” Zheng Xin and others looked at the pitiful Sun Kemin, their faces showing joy.

“Damn it! Hurry up and help me! Take this puppet!” Sun Kemin looked at Luo Tian’s group, as if finding salvation.

“We don’t have time. You wanted to hoard it, so we’ll give you this chance. We won’t fight for it!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes showed disdain.

“Although you are human, I’ll keep my word. If you defeat me, this puppet will be yours, and some of my inheritance techniques will also belong to you!” The cold voice came from the puppet, its golden eyes gazing at Luo Tian’s group.

Upon hearing the puppet’s words, Zheng Xin and others immediately stepped back. They still had some self-awareness; although they were strong now, they dared not confront a near-epoch-level puppet.

“That’s War King’s residual soul inhabiting the puppet. Though it can’t use techniques, War King fought all his life. His combat experience remains. Even without using techniques, it’s hard for anyone to withstand him. Plus, this puppet has a near-epoch-level body. Who can block it?” Zheng Xin and others spoke, gazing at the puppet charging toward Sun Kemin again.

Luo Tian also retreated to Zheng Xin’s group, unamused by Sun Kemin’s desire to monopolize everything.

“Damn it! You guys are ungrateful!” Sun Kemin looked at Luo Tian’s group and immediately jumped up, but before he could say more, he clashed with the puppet again. However, Sun Kemin was like a sandbag, constantly being thrown around by the puppet with War King’s residual soul.

“Hmph! Didn’t expect Sun Kemin, though not a good person, has such strength!” Zheng Xin and others watched the blood-spitting Sun Kemin, whispering admiration. They knew Sun Kemin wouldn’t die easily; he must have some life-saving items from his years of entering mausoleums.

“Hey, you guys! If you don’t help me, I’ll die from this puppet!” Sun Kemin cried out.

“Sun Kemin, pay some blood! Don’t expect us to help you without it!” Zheng Xin smiled and spoke to Sun Kemin.

“Impossible!” But Sun Kemin firmly replied, a tone of “money over life.”

“That’s it! We can only watch!” Diao Dezhu and others folded their arms, commenting.

“Hey, Sun Kemin, why is your arm broken?”

“Sun Kemin, you’re too slow. Speed up!” Diao Dezhu, Xu Liyi, Zheng Xin and others took pleasure in watching the chaos, constantly speaking.

“Pf!” Sun Kemin kept spitting blood. It was unclear whether it was from being hit or from the others’ provocation.

“I can’t take it anymore!” Sun Kemin fell to the ground again, quickly flying up while shouting.

“Don’t bleed, don’t help!” Zheng Xin spoke, pulling Luo Tian back who had taken a step forward and shook his head.

“Fine, you’re all heartless!” Sun Kemin finally couldn’t endure. He waved his hand, and a crystalline object flew out of his hand. The crystal radiated coldness, shaped like a frozen heart.

“Piercing Heart Ice!” Luo Tian instantly recognized it and smiled. He grabbed the ice, storing it away while sighing in relief. If not for Sun Kemin’s initiative to hand it over, he might have had to spend a lot of effort to exchange it from this skinflint.

“Not enough!” Zheng Xin and Diao Dezhu wore playful expressions. They knew Sun Kemin had accumulated a lot of good things over the years and wanted to make him feel pain.

“Here you go…” Sun Kemin waved his hand again, presenting a pseudo-epoch treasure to Luo Tian’s group.

“Not enough!”

“I’ll fight you!” Under Zheng Xin and others’ extortion, they each had a good treasure. Sun Kemin was completely mad, ignoring them.

“Enough! This kid really can’t take it anymore!” Luo Tian spoke softly, watching Sun Kemin whose chest had been crushed.

“Monkey Brother, there’s a battle here. Are you coming?” Diao Dezhu and Yan Jun rushed toward the tomb’s entrance, shouting loudly. Their voices echoed out of the tomb, rising into the Divine Clan's sacred mountain.

“What?” Yao Chen had just knocked down a disciple of early epoch-level Divine Clan. His face showed excitement, then transformed into golden light and vanished from the disciple’s sight.

Chapter 1569: The War King Puppet

Seeing Yao Chen’s back, the Divine Clan disciple nearly cried. His face showed relief.

“Hum…” Yao Chen’s figure instantly rushed into the War King Tomb, seeing a near-epoch-level puppet that had kicked Sun Kemin away.

“Hmph! This guy is strong!” Yao Chen’s eyes glowed with excitement. Without hesitation, he swung his golden staff toward the near-epoch-level puppet controlled by War King’s residual soul.

“Crack…” The golden staff swung out, carrying a thunderous wave. It smashed down on the near-epoch-level puppet.

“Good!” The puppet’s voice echoed loudly, as if a real person. Like War King reborn, it radiated powerful battle spirit and clenched its fists to smash the golden staff.

The thunderous collision echoed. The two clashed instantly, and Yao Chen’s body was thrown back. His arm trembled slightly, but his eyes glowed even more intensely.

While Yao Chen and the War King puppet fought, Sun Kemin also appeared before Luo Tian’s group with bruises. His face was full of regret.

“If I had known shouting would get me out, I wouldn’t have paid so much!” Sun Kemin was郁闷 and wanted to vomit blood. But he knew, with Zheng Xin’s group getting it, it was like a pork bun thrown at a dog—there was no way to get it back.

“Sun Kemin, this time we saved you. How do you plan to repay us?” Zheng Xin looked at Sun Kemin’s regretful face, his expression showing satisfaction as he teased.

“Go to hell!” Sun Kemin looked at Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi’s mocking faces, shouting.

“Boom…” However, Yao Chen and the War King puppet's battle drew Luo Tian’s group’s attention. They no longer focused on Sun Kemin.

The thunderous collision continued. The two fought constantly. Yao Chen’s staff left trails of afterimages, even Luo Tian couldn’t see the staff's movement. Sometimes it was brutally strong, sometimes like a venomous snake, constantly seeking War King’s weaknesses.

“You’re quite good. Your combat experience matches mine!” The residual soul of War King spoke, his voice filled with strong admiration.

“You’re not bad either. Very powerful!” Yao Chen’s face was also serious, having dropped his contempt. Though their combat experience was equal, the opponent was a near-epoch-level strength. To break through it, Yao Chen would need to expend great effort.

“Boom…” After another clash, blood flowed from Yao Chen’s mouth. However, the puppet radiated golden light, and the golden staff striking it only made it retreat a few steps. A series of seals surged, and it still charged at Yao Chen with terrifying momentum.

“Again!” Though Yao Chen was on the defensive, his battle spirit grew more intense. He seemed to have entered a state of mind, swinging the staff and clashing with the puppet again.

“Truly powerful. This monkey is so strong. I feel only Zhanbiao and Long Jie could match him. If we don’t consider physical strength alone, even Luo Tian might not be able to beat this monkey!” Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi’s faces showed admiration. Though they had heard about Yao Chen's past, seeing it with their own eyes still left them stunned.

“Do you want to be as strong as him?” Diao Dezhu smiled, gazing at Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi.

“Of course!” Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi nodded, then gazed at Diao Dezhu.

“Self-impose cultivation restrictions and start from the body refinement stage. Find people to fight every day! I heard this monkey did it like that!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes showed a touch of admiration, gazing at Yao Chen. Even with the War King's residual soul-controlled near-epoch-level puppet’s body, he spoke.

“Hmph!” Upon hearing Diao Dezhu's words, Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi couldn’t help but gasp. Even Luo Tian’s face showed admiration.

“Truly变态, maybe only the fighting apes like this could endure!” Luo Tian murmured. Even he felt he couldn’t bear it, the endless battles—both physically and mentally a torment.

“Battle has become an instinct for Yao Chen!” Long Jie spoke softly, clearly also admiring Yao Chen.

“According to the monkey’s words, if you don’t fight for a day, you feel uncomfortable!” Yan Jun smiled.

“Boom boom…” The thunderous collisions continued. Yao Chen fought more fiercely, though wounded and the situation was not optimistic for him. His injuries affected his combat ability, but he still persisted.

“Help! If this continues, I feel Yao Chen will be unable to endure!” Luo Tian spoke softly, watching Yao Chen thrown back by the puppet’s punch. He stepped toward the battlefield.

“I’ll help you!” Long Jie also shouted, following Luo Tian and rushing toward the near-epoch-level puppet.

However, Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin didn’t seem to want to fight. They knew that with Luo Tian, Yao Chen, and Long Jie’s strength, even a real near-epoch-level master would be in trouble if they fought desperately.

“Diao Dezhu, you go too! You’ve been bragging about how strong you are all the time!” Zheng Xin and others redirected the topic to Diao Dezhu.

“It’s better to leave opportunities for the youth!” Diao Dezhu’s mouth twitched, his face showing a touch of satisfaction. He secretly sighed: “Can I compare with this变态? If I go, will I become the puppet’s sandbag?”

“Diao Dezhu, if you keep bragging, it’ll really cause a fight!” Zheng Xin and others looked at Diao Dezhu’s expression, causing a commotion.

“Boom…” As Diao Dezhu and others quarreled, Luo Tian and Long Jie joined the battlefield, easing some of Yao Chen’s pressure.

Luo Tian's aura was radiant. After several days of recovery, his injuries had long been healed. Although his reincarnation immortal body hadn’t fully recovered, it was enough to deal with a puppet without epoch power.

“Boom…” In an instant, Luo Tian’s fist smashed against the puppet's body. He felt his fist hit a hard stone.

On the other side, Long Jie also struck a palm against the puppet's body. Yao Chen’s staff also landed on the puppet's head.

Three thunderous collisions echoed, and in the next moment, Luo Tian and his group retreated repeatedly. The puppet, surrounded by three attacks, also stepped back, crashing into the hall’s wall with thunderous echoes.

“Good! Truly good!” War King's voice echoed from the puppet. Though it had no sensation, he felt that Luo Tian’s group’s attacks had caused significant damage to the puppet.

“Actually, you could have stayed out of it. I haven’t had enough fun yet!” Yao Chen spoke to Long Jie and Luo Tian, then flew forward again, attacking the puppet.

“Hurry up!” Luo Tian spoke softly. His arm radiated waves of white light.
