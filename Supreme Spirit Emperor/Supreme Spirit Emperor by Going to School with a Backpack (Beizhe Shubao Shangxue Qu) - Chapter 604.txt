"Luotian, are you truly bold enough to take the World Heart? Do you think my father will let you go?"

"Better hand him over to me. I'll ensure no one dares trouble you on Bountiful Sky Mountain!" Jiang Yulong roared, his voice laced with ferocity.

"Give it away, but not to you!" Luotian lightly shook his head, extending a hand. The starry expanse shattered, and a figure emerged from the heavens, gasping for breath, his form resembling a beggar.

"Jiang Yuzhe!" Upon seeing the figure, Jiang Yulong and others gasped in shock. They hadn't expected Jiang Yuzhe to still be alive.

Jiang Yuzhe stared at the group in bewilderment, but when he glimpsed the World Heart, his eyes gleamed with fervor.

"Brother Jiang, this is your treasure!" Luotian sighed softly, though he was reluctant. As Jiang Yulong and others had said, the World Heart could never belong to him.

"Alas..." Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang exhaled deeply, understanding Luotian's hidden motives. Who would willingly relinquish such an opportunity?

"Brother Luotian! I'll remember this favor. On Bountiful Sky Mountain, as long as I have a morsel of food, I'll never slight you!" Jiang Yuzhe declared loudly, his voice trembling with emotion as he seized the World Heart.

Chapter 2285: Elder ( )

Jiang Yuzhe gazed at the World Heart in his hands, speechless with gratitude. Upon entering the Immortal Ruins, he'd done little, not even surviving the Death Gate as Jiang Huantian had. Yet Luotian had endured and claimed the World Heart.

Holding the World Heart, Jiang Yuzhe instantly refined it without the arduous process Luotian had faced. As he completed its refinement, his gaze fell upon Jiang Yulong and the others.

"Little Nine, what are you doing?" Jiang Yulong barked, his eyes heavy with bitterness. He hadn't expected the World Heart to fall into Jiang Yuzhe's grasp.

"Death Gate, come forth!" Jiang Yuzhe murmured, raising his hand. A resounding crash echoed as a golden-black gate materialized in the sky—no stranger to those who had been eliminated, even semi-Immortals.

"After all this, it's time to reap the rewards. The Immortal Ruins hold many treasures; this Death Gate is one. Brother Luotian, keep it!" Jiang Yuzhe smiled, snatching the gate as it shrunk and flew toward Luotian.

"Brother Tu, thank you for your aid. Take the Death Gate yourself!" Luotian spoke softly, his gaze on Tu Feiyang.

"Ah..." Tu Feiyang's expression faltered, his gaze complex as he looked at Luotian. He hadn't expected Luotian to gift him the Death Gate, yet he sensed it was no less formidable than his own Demon-Subjugating Sword.

"Damned luck after all these years—finally seeing a return on my investment!" Tu Feiyang clutched the gate, his heart nearly bursting.

"Boom..." A thunderous roar echoed again as a black mountain plummeted from the sky, landing before them.

"This was once a treasured artifact. Brother Luotian, take it as well!"

"And this Obsidian Moon Sword..." Jiang Yuzhe presented one treasure after another before Luotian, who felt deeply satisfied.

Having mastered the World Heart, Luotian knew where treasures lay in the Immortal Ruins. Yet he'd held back, waiting for Jiang Yuzhe's reaction upon claiming it.

"These items may not rival the World Heart, but they are a token of my sincerity," Jiang Yuzhe murmured.

Luotian did not accept them, instead gifting them to Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang.

"I have one more request for Brother Jiang," Luotian said softly, his tone solemn.

"Speak freely, Brother Luotian. If it's within my power, I'll do it," Jiang Yuzhe replied, his expression growing serious.

"I want people—everyone in this Immortal Ruins, including these three!" Luotian pointed at Fuxingyue, Fuxingyang, and Tu Feiyang.

"No problem! Now the World Heart is in my hands!" Jiang Yuzhe nodded. With the World Heart, their fates were now under his control. To obtain them, Luotian needed only a single thought to teleport them from the Starry Domain to the Immortal Realm.

"Buzz..." As they finished speaking, waves of energy surged over Luotian and the others. Their bodies vanished beneath the starry expanse.

"Must we stay here?" Fuxingyue, Fuxingyang, and Tu Feiyang gazed at the empty stars, their forms appearing outside the Demon Cavern.

At Bountiful Sky Mountain's peak, people wore expectant expressions as they watched the platform. Dozens of weary figures stood there.

"Even a semi-Immortal emerged?"

"Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng were the first to exit!" People murmured, observing those on the platform—those eliminated before Luotian's group. Some had been killed, like Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng, who Luotian had slain but not truly killed; they'd been reborn on Bountiful Sky Mountain. Others perished in perilous zones, also reborn here—a different form of elimination.

"Only the eldest, second eldest, and Little Nine remain. Who will succeed?" Jiang Yuhong sighed, bitterness on his face. Just now, his last hope—his semi-Immortal companion—had emerged.

"Probably the eldest. His strength surpasses us all," Jiang Yuxian sighed, waiting for the final result.

"Buzz..." As people pondered, a vortex of void appeared, and several figures tumbled out—semi-Immortals Luotian had hurled into the void with his Immortal-grade techniques.

"How is this possible? Even they failed?" Seeing the semi-Immortals, people gasped. With these figures' emergence, all semi-Immortals in the Immortal Ruins had now exited.

"Damn it!" Jiang Yuwen stood among the crowd, his eyes burning with resentment. If not for Jiang Yulong's trio ambushing him, he wouldn't have been eliminated. Moreover, upon emerging, his comrades had extorted him again, dispelling their doubts only after he explained.

"What's going on inside?" The semi-Immortals asked as they were surrounded.

"Luotian is refining the World Heart!" Jiang Dao spoke, his voice laced with bitterness.

"What? Luotian?"

"Who is Luotian? I've never heard of him!" Upon hearing Jiang Dao's words, people were puzzled. They'd never heard of Luotian.

"He was the one brought in by Little Nine, from Star River Sect!" Soon, Luotian's information spread.

Previously, people had dismissed him as a random choice by Jiang Yuzhe. None expected that one person would ultimately triumph.

"Luotian!" Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying's faces lit up with joy. They hadn't anticipated the winner to be Luotian.

"How could that be? You all are semi-Immortals—how could you lose to a single Immortal peak?" Jiang Yuwen bellowed, his voice filled with anger.

"That kid possesses techniques rivaling Immortal-grade attacks. We couldn't withstand them!" Jiang Dao sighed bitterly.

As people debated, a surge of energy rippled across the heavens. Several figures appeared in their sight—Luotian and his group.

"Emerging!" People erupted, eyes fixed on those on the platform.

"It's Little Nine!" Soon, they saw Jiang Yuzhe clutching the World Heart. Now the World Heart was palm-sized, crystalline and radiant like a heart of crystal, yet people could sense its formidable power.

"This is the World Heart! It can evolve into a world treasure!" People gazed with envy. A world treasure was exceptionally rare; even an elite artifact would spark a frenzy. How much more precious was this?

"Luotian!" But Jiang Yuwen's group focused on the figure beside Jiang Yuzhe—Luotian, his body wreathed in demonic aura.

"Jiang Yuzhe is appointed as Bountiful Sky Mountain's Young Master!" As people clamored, Jiang Taibai's voice echoed in their ears, causing the disciples to pause slightly.

Simultaneously, Jiang Taibai presented a jade ring symbolizing the Young Master to Jiang Yuzhe.

"They're not dead!" Luotian stood beside Jiang Yuzhe, spotting Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng—his former victims—who had barely stifled a gasp.

"Those bearing the Bountiful Sky Seal can be resurrected upon elimination!" Jiang Yuzhe understood Luotian's shock and explained.

"Ah, I see!" Upon hearing Jiang Yuzhe's words, Luotian exhaled deeply. As long as they were alive, his troubles wouldn't be so dire.

"Luotian..." Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng glared at Luotian, their teeth clenched. Though they hadn't died, they now harbored deep hatred for him.

"Jiang Huantian, former master of the Phantom Heaven Sect, semi-Immortal level. He is reassigned to Bountiful Sky Mountain and appointed as a Jiang family elder!"

"Xiao Feiying, disciple of the Flying Eagle Sect in Central Three Realms. Permission granted to enter Bountiful Sky Mountain as an elder!"

"Luotian, disciple of Star River Sect in Central Three Realms. His battlefield achievements in Bountiful City were remarkable. Permission granted to enter Bountiful Sky Mountain as a Disciplinary Elder!" As people discussed, Jiang Taibai spoke again.

"Disciplinary Elder!" Upon hearing Jiang Taibai's words, people's faces showed disbelief. Their gazes turned to Jiang Taibai.

Disciplinary Elders were vital in any sect. Bountiful Sky Mountain's Disciplinary Elder was under Jiang Taibai's control. Those entering the Disciplinary Elders were typically retired from Bountiful City—each a hardened individual.

"One ascends, and all under him benefit!" People could imagine Luotian's future standing in Bountiful Sky Mountain.

"Little Nine, you truly outshone us!" Jiang Yuhong and others addressed Jiang Yuzhe. They hadn't aimed for the Young Master position; they'd merely coveted the World Heart.

"Respectful greetings, Young Master!" Bountiful Sky Mountain disciples bowed to Jiang Yuzhe, their gazes respectful. Regardless of the outcome, it was now decided.

"Congratulations, Luotian!" Bai Tian smiled, addressing Luotian. He'd been eliminated earlier and hadn't taken it seriously.

"Brother Bai, once I settle in, you're welcome to visit me!" Bai Tian extended a gesture of goodwill. Luotian naturally couldn't refuse, responding with a nod.

"Enough. All of you return! Luotian, follow me!" Jiang Taibai addressed the crowd with a smile.

"Wait!" As Jiang Taibai's words faded, three figures descended from the sky, appearing in their sight.

Three elders, their hair white with age, radiated immense power. Upon seeing them, Bountiful Sky Mountain disciples immediately bowed: "Respectful greetings to the Three Elders!"

"Three Elders of Bountiful Sky Mountain?" Jiang Taibai's brow furrowed slightly, his gaze on the three elders. He wondered what their purpose was.

Chapter 2286: Punishment for Deserters

"Taibai, I have a matter to confirm!" One elder stepped forward, his gaze fixed on Luotian.

"Luotian, did you desert from Bountiful City?" The elder's voice thundered, causing people to tremble.

Desertion was a taboo—a capital offense. There had been deserters in Bountiful City before, and their fates were grim—even those with connections faced consequences.

Luotian's body trembled slightly, surprised by the sudden accusation.

"Answer simply—deserted or not?" The elder coldly stared at Luotian, his eyes flashing with menace.

The three elders were supporters of Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, and Jiang Yuwen. They'd closely monitored the trial's progress. They hadn't expected Jiang Yuzhe to claim the World Heart. Their anger was immense, and since they couldn't harm Jiang Yuzhe, they vented their frustration on Luotian.

"Deserted!" Luotian nodded lightly. He had indeed fled from Bountiful City.

"Report to the Elders: Luotian not only deserted but also stole three-tenths of Bountiful City's resources. Our Lord is currently hunting him. Please imprison him in the death cell!" As Luotian's words ended, a booming voice echoed. A purple-cloaked figure stepped forward—Xue Zilong, who had previously taken the blame for Luotian.

"What?" Upon hearing Xue Zilong's words, people erupted in chaos. They hadn't expected Luotian to have such a history.

"Deserters are executed by Bountiful Sky Mountain's rules!" The three elders wasted no words. One elder raised his hand, a golden palm slicing through the heavens toward Luotian.

An Immortal-grade strike—earth-shattering, splitting the sky as it descended upon Luotian.

"Would you at least let me explain?" Luotian's face darkened, his voice rising as he watched the palm.

"Sixth Uncle, Luotian must have had reasons. His crime isn't death!" Jiang Yuzhe roared, knowing only Jiang Taibai could save Luotian.

Zhang Ziping and Lei Yong's faces darkened. They hadn't expected the elder to strike so swiftly.

"Three Elders, even if Luotian is guilty, it's not your place to handle this!" Jiang Taibai spoke softly. A golden sword flew from his back, clashing with the palm.

"Crash..." The heavens trembled as a violent aura swept over Luotian and the group, causing their bodies to quiver.

The sword returned to Jiang Taibai's back. He stood beside Luotian, his smile unchanged: "Speak!"

"Why did I desert? You can ask Bountiful City's Lord Jiang Chen!"

"I am a disciple of Star River Sect in Central Three Realms. I served for three years, but why did I return nearly twenty years later? Many who served with me know!"

"I fell into the Hell Realm. It wasn't because I couldn't return, but Lord Jiang Chen assigned me a mission—to find the Mother of the River of Flowers in Hell!"

"Everyone, I'd only served three months when Lord Jiang Chen ordered me to undertake this mission. That's why I delved into Hell!"

"Do you know how dangerous this task was? Not even an Immortal could complete it!"

"For over a decade, I fought tirelessly for this mission. Finally, with my life, I obtained a drop of the Mother's essence and overcame all obstacles to return to Bountiful City!"

"What did Lord Jiang Chen do? No reward, but he ordered me to hunt ghosts outside the city and barred my return. This was clearly an attempt to kill me! If I didn't flee, I'd be dead!" Luotian's voice rang out, filled with anger and sorrow. The crowd fell silent.

"Everything I've said is true. Xue Zilong, you were also in Bountiful City. Did Lord Jiang Chen issue such orders? Dare you swear he didn't?"

"Also, you claim I stole three-tenths of Bountiful City's resources. Do you have proof? I was a late-stage True Immortal, while Lord Jiang Chen was early-stage. How could I steal resources from him? Did he not see me?" Luotian roared again, snapping people out of their stupor.

"Are you certain you're not lying?" Jiang Taibai's eyes flickered, his gaze on Luotian now showing danger.

"Ridiculous! Fabricated lies—this is your one-sided account!" The three elders barked.

"I dare swear by the Dao. Can Xue Zilong?" Upon hearing the elders' words, Luotian sneered, his gaze on Xue Zilong, who was stunned.

"I..." Xue Zilong hesitated. He indeed dared not, for when he returned, Lord Jiang Chen had ordered him to blame everything on Luotian.

In truth, Luotian dared not swear either—those resources were indeed taken by him. Yet he was certain Lord Jiang Chen would handle it cleanly, leaving no traces for investigation.

"Unexpectedly, Bountiful City is like this..."

"I was also in Bountiful City. It truly isn't a place for people. A higher rank could crush you!"

"If Lord Jiang Chen wanted to kill Luotian, it was easy. If I were in his place, I'd have run too!" Bountiful City disciples murmured.

"If I'm not mistaken, Lord Jiang Chen is close to the eldest brother, right?" Jiang Taibai's lips curled slightly as he gazed at Jiang Yulong standing there.

"The Disciplinary Elders' blades are a bit dull; they need sharpening!" Jiang Taibai chuckled, then addressed the three Elders: "Three Elders, thank you. The rest is left to me!"

"What..." The three elders' faces shifted slightly. They hadn't expected this swift turn of events. Originally, they'd wanted to execute Luotian for their own satisfaction but hadn't anticipated dragging Lord Jiang Chen into it. If the Disciplinary Elders investigated, it would be thorough.

Lord Jiang Chen had held absolute power in Bountiful City for years; no one would believe he had none. "Out of the army, command is independent," everyone understood, but no one had dared to speak it aloud.

"As for Luotian, though his case is understandable, desertion still carries a penalty—ten years without resources!" Jiang Taibai spoke softly, not lingering.

Zhang Ziping and Lei Yong followed Jiang Taibai out of the crowd. The three Elders said nothing, for Jiang Taibai was no easy opponent.

Luotian followed Jiang Taibai obediently, sighing inwardly at the comfort of having a patron. Without Jiang Taibai, he'd have faced great trouble today. Yet Luotian was puzzled—throughout the process, Lord Jiang Chen hadn't appeared, nor had a mid-level Immortal.

They walked along, reaching a mountain peak where the atmosphere was solemn. Young disciples gazed with reverence at Luotian and his group ascending the summit.

"Is that Luotian? Our new Disciplinary Elder?" Disciples murmured among themselves.

"He's so young! Perhaps the youngest elder in Bountiful Sky Mountain!" Disciples chattered, their discussions spreading quickly. Luotian's name had briefly become a buzz in Bountiful Sky Mountain.

"The Disciplinary Elder holds high status in Bountiful Sky Mountain, but the responsibility is immense. There are eighteen peaks in total; the Disciplinary Elder's peak is first. The Disciplinary Elders and elders number about 1.18 million, making it the largest peak."

"Ours is to supervise the disciples of each peak. Though simple, it's exhausting!" Jiang Taibai spoke to Luotian, his tone casual as he sipped wine, causing Luotian's lips to twitch.

"No need to look; this elder is also a hands-off type!" Luotian instantly understood Jiang Taibai's nature, knowing he wouldn't micromanage.

"Ziping, take this newcomer to settle in!" Jiang Taibai spoke, then handed Luotian over to Zhang Ziping and left.

"Yes..." Zhang Ziping nodded, a smile on his face as he looked at Luotian.

"Earlier than expected!" Zhang Ziping chuckled, while Lei Yong and Ji Chen's faces bore admiration as they gazed at Luotian. His cultivation had now matched theirs.

"Hey kid, welcome!" Tian Fu smiled, greeting Luotian.

"Come on, let's find you a place to stay first, then I'll explain the Disciplinary Elders' rules!" Zhang Ziping led Luotian further up the peak.

"Once you're in the Disciplinary Elders, don't worry about Bountiful Sky Mountain's rules. As the Elder said, we are the rules of Bountiful Sky Mountain. Unless you do something extremely reckless, no one dares touch Disciplinary Elders!"

"Like those three Elders—today if it were another peak's master, they might have continued to hound you. But since it was Elder Jiang Taibai, they had no choice but to retreat!" Zhang Ziping spoke as they reached a spacious courtyard on the mountain's upper part.

"This is where you'll live. I and others reside nearby. The surrounding area is also home to those from Bountiful City; we're all soldiers, so it's natural to be close!" Zhang Ziping spoke, exchanging with the guards before entering the courtyard.

"You're an Elder; you can have 100 Disciplinary Elders under you. The eight people you brought can also accompany you into Bountiful Sky Mountain as attendants. I've already arranged for it!" Zhang Ziping told Luotian, who felt warmth within. He silently marveled at Zhang Ziping's thoughtfulness.

Moments later, a banquet appeared in Luotian's courtyard. Zhang Ziping and others sat around the table, chatting.

"Haha, Brother Ziping, I've smelled wine—why didn't you invite me!" As they began eating and drinking, a loud laugh echoed from outside the courtyard. A tall figure stood at Luotian's courtyard entrance.

Chapter 2287: Punishment ( )

"Haha, Elder Xiong, welcome! I'm sorry for my negligence!" Zhang Ziping laughed, standing up to greet the sturdy figure.

As he spoke, Zhang Ziping led the robust man into the courtyard. Tian Fu and Lei Yong stood up, their gazes carrying a touch of respect.

"Come on, Little Tian, let me introduce you. This is Elder Xiong!"

"Elder Xiong, this is my younger brother, Luotian!" Zhang Ziping introduced the two.

"Indeed a prodigy! Haha, I just heard this kid slaughtered everyone in the Immortal Ruins!" Elder Xiong laughed, his gaze filled with admiration as he patted Luotian's shoulder.

"Elder Xiong, please sit!" Luotian bowed to Elder Xiong, recognizing him as a battle-hardened veteran from his scars and aura.

Elder Xiong laughed heartily, ignoring Luotian's demonic aura as he sat at the table and raised his cup to drink.

"Haha, refreshing..." Elder Xiong bellowed, not being polite and devouring meat and drinking wine.

"Haha, Elder Xiong, you two sneak drinks again without inviting us!" As Elder Xiong sat down, another loud laugh echoed from outside the courtyard. A group of figures stood at the entrance.

"Ugh, they're here again..." Lei Yong sighed deeply, watching the figures at the gate with a look of helplessness.

"Lei Zi, you've run here to drink—too unkind!" A big man approached Lei Yong, patting his shoulder.

A group of twenty to thirty people, mostly broad-shouldered and rugged, laughed as they entered the courtyard. The guards stationed there seemed accustomed to this, stepping back instantly and setting up tables in Luotian's courtyard.

"You guys are really dogs—smell the wine and find it!" Lei Yong muttered, watching people sit at tables.

"Little Tian, go greet them; they're friends!" Zhang Ziping smiled, albeit reluctantly, and told Luotian.

"Sure!" Luotian understood Zhang Ziping's intent immediately, laughing and grabbing a wine jar to greet each table.

The courtyard atmosphere quickly became lively. Luotian enjoyed their personalities, engaging in conversations about their past experiences in the military camp.

They drank until midnight, yet no one showed signs of leaving. Luotian finally understood why Lei Yong had looked helpless when they arrived.

"Drunkards!" Luotian mentally labeled them, their drinking as natural as water without needing to expel the alcohol's aura. Naturally, he didn't use his cultivation to expel it either.

"Big brother, you're a true friend! From now on, you're my younger brother. Who dares harm you, I'll be the first to beat them!" Elder Xiong wrapped his arm around Luotian's shoulder, laughing.

Time passed as they drank until midday the next day before finally settling down. A group of people lay sprawled, snoring.

"Hey... they're asleep!" As Luotian dozed off, a playful voice echoed from outside the courtyard. A thin figure followed by two disciples entered.

Dressed in gray robes, a dark belt at his waist, and with peach-like eyes scanning over Luotian's group, the man's gaze held disdain.

"Take that kid away!" The man spoke softly, pointing at Luotian.

"Yes..." Two disciples looked at the sprawled people, fear in their eyes, but they obeyed. They approached Luotian with a gray rope to bind him.

"Boom..." Before Luotian could resist, a gray hand smashed down, striking the two semi-Immortal disciples and sending them flying.

"Jiang Xiaohua, what brings you here?" A thunderous voice echoed as a tall figure stood beside Luotian, barking at Elder Xiong.

"Get lost! Don't bother us here!" The other big men stood up, their gazes unkind toward the thin man.

"What..." The man called Jiang Xiaohua's face shifted slightly, his gaze on Elder Xiong and others now showing fear.

"Damn it, Jiang Xiaohua, you're really looking for trouble!" A big man stepped forward, shouting. This man was a semi-Immortal among the group, aside from Elder Xiong and Zhang Ziping.

"Elder Xiong, we're following the Deputy Elder's orders to take this kid away. You dare interfere?"

"I'm Jiang Xiaohua, not Jiang Xiaohua! If anyone calls me that again, don't blame me for turning hostile!" Jiang Xiaohua's face darkened.

"The Deputy Elder is Jiang Kang, who controls the entire Disciplinary Elders. Since the Elder doesn't like managing affairs and has been a hands-off type, he only appeared this time because of the nine young masters' trials. Otherwise, in the Disciplinary Elders, it's been years since anyone saw him!"

"Now the Disciplinary Elders have 1.5 million people, adding over 400,000 more. Yet the Elder knows nothing!"

"The Jiang family is a direct branch of the Jiang clan, so they're trusted. However, this Jiang Kang is no good—greedy, petty, and vengeful!" As Elder Xiong and Jiang Xiaohua spoke, Lei Yong conveyed to Luotian through telepathy.

"Ah, I see!" Luotian's experience made him understand Lei Yong's meaning immediately. Clearly, someone was seeking trouble for him. Jiang Kang's nature was well-known; Elder Xiong and others appeared righteous, but their status was higher than his, causing tension. Naturally, conflict arose.

"Jiang Kang's up to what again?" Elder Xiong and others growled, then gazed at Luotian.

"Brother, don't fear. We'll go with you. I want to see what Jiang Kang has in mind!" Elder Xiong chuckled, seeming transformed.

"Thank you, Elder Xiong!" Luotian nodded, silently marveling at the wine from yesterday. Now in Bountiful Sky Mountain, though he was an Elder, Elders couldn't act recklessly.

"Let's go!" Luotian addressed Jiang Xiaohua, remaining composed. Zhang Ziping and Elder Xiong didn't leave but followed Jiang Xiaohua out of the courtyard, a group of twenty to thirty people heading toward the Deputy Elder's location.

Jiang Xiaohua walked ahead, with Elder Xiong and others trailing behind. His heart drummed nervously; despite being a late-stage True Immortal, he felt overwhelmed by their presence.

They soon reached a grand hall with an imposing aura. Jiang Xiaohua pushed open the door, and a killing atmosphere surged from within.

They entered the hall. A middle-aged man sat at the head, with ten others seated around him. Upon Luotian's group entering, the people in the hall were surprised—so many had arrived.

"Elder Xiong, what are you here for?" The head middle-aged man barked, his voice laced with dissatisfaction.

"You're also Elders; they have the right to be here, so why don't we?" Elder Xiong's gaze held disdain.

"You..." Upon hearing Elder Xiong's words, Jiang Kang's face darkened but he suppressed his anger.

"Of course they have the right!"

"Sit down, then. Everyone has the right to listen!" Jiang Kang sneered. Elder Xiong and others chuckled, quickly filling the side seats—evidently not their first time.

"Brother, come sit! Standing there—your a Elder too, appointed by the Elder himself. You have the right to sit!" Elder Xiong called out to Luotian, who was still standing.

"Okay..." Luotian gazed at Elder Xiong, surprised by his disregard for Jiang Kang.

"Wait! Luotian, today's interrogation is about you!" Jiang Kang sneered, stopping Luotian. His gaze swept over Luotian, eyes gleaming with intent.

Luotian halted, locking eyes with Jiang Kang before bowing: "What's the matter, Deputy Elder? What crime have I committed?"

"What crime? None really. But your demonic aura suggests you're a demon disciple. Tell us about your experiences in Hell these years. We want to thoroughly investigate your background and determine if you're a spy sent by the Hell Realm!" Jiang Kang spoke.

"Yes, demon disciples are all no good—full of slaughter. How can they stay in our Disciplinary Elders!" Jiang Kang's words had barely finished when the people seated with him roared, their gazes fierce as they stared at Luotian.

"I have nothing to say. Do I need to recount every detail of my daily life?" Luotian lightly shook his head. These people were clearly seeking trouble, and Jiang Taibai hadn't accused him of anything. Yet they acted like rabid dogs, biting him—no matter what he said, they'd call it foul.

"It seems you won't talk unless we beat you. I don't know what the Disciplinary Elders are for, but we have a thousand methods to make you speak!"

"Come on, use the Soul-Piercing Nails!" Jiang Kang sneered, his words aligning with his intent. As he spoke, Elder Xiong and Zhang Ziping's faces shifted slightly.

Chapter 2288: Jiang Taibai's Intent
