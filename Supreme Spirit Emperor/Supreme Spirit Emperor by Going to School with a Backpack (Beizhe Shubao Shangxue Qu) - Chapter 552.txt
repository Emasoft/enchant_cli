“Their initial assault was stronger, but they no longer have the chance for another coordinated attack. Thus, they can only be picked off one by one.” The people murmured among themselves, watching the fearless Luo Tian felling family disciples with each strike.

“Why are you all just standing there? Take revenge on whoever bullied you earlier!” Luo Tian smashed a youth to the ground with a punch, shouting at the Luo clan members.

“Yes! That bastard Wang Hui beat me earlier—I must avenge myself!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Luo clan members’ eyes lit up. They rushed toward the fallen figure.

Cries of agony echoed constantly as those brought by Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu were mercilessly beaten by the Luo clan. After half an hour of fighting, Luo Tian had felled both Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu.

Absolute domination—such was the image of Luo Tian in the eyes of the Luo clan disciples, a godlike presence.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, dragging Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu before Zhang Menlie.

“What did you say about him?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu. Though wounded, they remained conscious, though their bodies were temporarily sealed by Luo Tian.

“Leave it to you!” Luo Tian waved his hand, tossing the two before Zhang Menlie.

“Thank you, Master!” Zhang Menlie’s face instantly showed gratitude. He had not expected Luo Tian to still think of him.

“It’s nothing,” Luo Tian nodded, then sat down to watch the performance—the young Luo clan members beating the city’s renowned geniuses.

“Let me out! I’ve learned my lesson, Luo Chen Master—let me off this time!” Begging voices echoed through the hall, startling the Luo clan members.

“Luo Chen Master? Did I hear that right? Isn’t Luo Chen Master poisoned? How did he come here?” The Luo clan murmured, disbelieving the voice from within.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, Luo Tian finally stopped his clan’s beating. His decree was clear: strike, but do not kill.

Zhang Menlie also pleased Luo Tian greatly; he had not harmed Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu, instead extracting considerable benefits from them.

Luo Tian knew Zhang Menlie’s motive was largely for his sake—Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu were key figures in their families, future kings and heirs. If Zhang Menlie had truly beaten them, it would have caused resentment.

Luo Tian’s beating was one thing, but Zhang Menlie’s actions were different. For Luo Tian, it mattered little whether Zhang Menlie struck them or not; what pleased him was Zhang Menlie’s conduct and attitude.

“Open the door!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze on the hall’s entrance—not just to the Luo clan members, but also to Chen Dao.

“Hum…” The barrier dissolved, and the hall’s door slowly creaked open. Barely half-open, the Luo clan members saw the grim scene inside and were stunned.

“My heavens… this…” People gazed at the fallen figures sprawled on the ground, their faces filled with awe.

“Luo Chen Master!” Soon after, they were all drawn to Luo Tian’s figure emerging from the hall. Their expressions shifted from shock to ecstatic joy.

“So this entire thing was truly done by Luo Chen Master? My heavens!” They were speechless, yet all faces bore excitement.

Luo Chen’s feat proved his poison had been cured, allowing him to enter the Rebirth Palace.

“Reversing the impossible—how could he unravel a poison no one else could? What can’t Luo Chen Master achieve?” The crowd cheered.

“Deal with these people—ask my father,” Luo Tian spoke softly, then led Zhang Menlie toward his residence.

“Have to pay compensation…” The Luo clan members grew uneasy; they had beaten others so severely, yet now demanded payment.

“Ha! No wonder the rumors say the Young Master is insatiable, but I like it!” A man laughed heartily, gazing at Luo Tian’s departure.

“Luo Xiong truly has remarkable charisma!” As Luo Tian had taken only a few steps, a light laugh echoed in their ears, drawing the Luo clan’s attention and halting Luo Tian.

“Wang Lie!” A figure materialized, accompanied by a youth, approaching the hall.

Lying on the ground, Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu saw Wang Lie’s arrival and immediately cried out: “Wang Xiong, this Luo Chen is arrogant—please avenge us!”

Wang Lie saw their pitiful state and trembled. He knew he could never reach such a level.

Especially Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu—combined, they would have been formidable, with a seventy percent chance of defeating him.

“Revenge?” Luo Tian mentally cursed; he knew these people aimed to drag him into the conflict, making him enemies with all.

“His skill surpasses mine—no need to blame others! I am not Luo Xiong’s match!” Wang Lie sneered, his voice laced with disdain.

They had attempted to humiliate Luo Tian through chaos, but he had never respected them. Now Wang Lie followed the Beast Ghost King’s orders to befriend Luo Tian, even if he had the strength, he would not provoke enmity.

“Earlier during the trial, there was a misunderstanding with Luo Xiong. I’ve come to resolve it. No ill intent—Luo Xiong, would you grant me this courtesy?” Wang Lie bowed to Luo Tian.

Wang Lie’s words had barely finished when all fell silent, the scene frozen in awkwardness. Wang Lie’s face turned slightly embarrassed.

“Of course!” Luo Tian recovered first, his eyes flashing. “Zhang Menlie, prepare a feast to welcome Wang Xiong!”

“Wang Lie—why did he come personally to Luo Tian’s place to resolve past grievances?” All pondered, surprised Wang Lie had done so.

“What’s going on?” The Luo clan members were bewildered, yet their eyes overflowed with admiration for Luo Tian. Even the elder generation of the clan felt this way.

Who was Wang Lie? The son of the Beast Ghost King himself. In the entire Beast Ghost King City, who dared defy Wang Lie? Even family heads addressed him as “Young Master,” for the city was entirely under the Wang clan’s control.

All families, in truth, were vassals of the Beast Ghost King. Wang Lie’s status was unparalleled—yet he had come to reconcile with Luo Tian, a gesture of immense respect.

Zhang Menlie snapped out of his trance and hurried away, vanishing from sight. Luo Tian led Wang Lie toward his residence.

“Boom…” As the two left, the crowd erupted in chatter. The Luo clan members were elated; Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu bore bitter expressions.

…

In Luo Tian’s study, a lavish banquet was laid out. Luo Tian and Wang Lie clinked cups repeatedly, while Zhang Menlie stood respectfully behind them, pouring wine.

“Wang Xiong, I’ll drink this one—earlier during the trial, I offended you. I’ll return your belongings doubled; let this be our friendship!” Luo Tian chuckled, waving his hand to present a storage ring to Wang Lie.

“Not fighting leads to friendship, right? A trinket—should you ever need help entering the Rebirth Palace, my elder brother holds some prestige there!” Wang Lie spoke softly, pushing back the ring.

After several rounds of wine, their conversation deepened. Wang Lie’s personality suited Luo Tian well; their rapport grew stronger.

Though Luo Tian was slightly puzzled by Wang Lie’s sudden warmth, he detected no malice in him.

“Luo Xiong, I’m curious—how did you unravel the Heavenly Net Poison? Not only did you free yourself, but your cultivation also ascended!” Wang Lie inquired, hoping to glean information about the mysterious power. Perhaps the Beast Ghost King could deduce its identity from clues, as few in Hell surpassed him.

“It’s quite difficult,” Luo Tian replied, “I once received a heritage that recorded the Heavenly Net Poison. I merely attempted it—unsuccessfully, yet it worked!” Luo Tian’s mind mused; he sensed Wang Lie’s true intent and the sudden shift.

Wang Lie smiled, suspecting Luo Tian was concealing the truth. He did not press further, his gaze flickering to Luo Tian’s jade pendant.

Chapter 2107: Departure()

Seeing Luo Tian’s jade pendant, Wang Lie’s eyes flickered slightly, yet his smile remained. “Luo Xiong, where did you obtain this jade? It’s quite exquisite.”

“Does Wang Xiong recognize it?” Luo Tian’s body trembled slightly, his gaze on Wang Lie as he removed the pendant.

“Not just recognize—it was a woman who passed through my Beast Ghost City, pursued by Luo Bai. I rescued her, and we had a brief encounter.”

“She left only her name before departing.”

“When my elder brother entered the Rebirth Palace, I accompanied him. In the palace, I saw a woman—unbelievable, it was her! Since then, I’ve never forgotten her!”

“This jade is hers. That’s why I sought entry into the Rebirth Palace,” Wang Lie said, a wistful look on his face.

Luo Tian’s heart trembled; his fingers shook involuntarily, a smile on his face. “To move you so deeply—she must be a rare beauty.”

Luo Tian felt uneasy; who could bear another man’s obsession with their wife? Yet he had no choice but to learn about Fu Xingxuan from Wang Lie.

Luo Tian was certain Wang Lie referred to Fu Xingxuan, for only her aura and beauty could bewitch someone so profoundly.

“Yes, she was the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen—no one else!” Wang Lie seemed to recall something, his eyes softening.

“May I know this exquisite beauty’s name?” Luo Tian asked, wanting to slap Wang Lie’s face and shout, “Wake up! She’s already taken!”

“Rebirth Palace Holy Maiden Fu Xingxuan!”

“Unexpectedly, she transformed into the Rebirth Palace’s Holy Maiden!” Wang Lie spoke, his voice laced with admiration.

“Luo Xiong, how did you obtain this jade? If possible, I’d like to acquire it. I’ll pay any price to satisfy you!” Wang Lie’s eyes burned with desire.

Wang Lie was certain Fu Xingxuan and Luo Chen had no connection, for at that time, Luo Chen was an obscure figure. This jade might have been taken by Luo Bai during his pursuit of Fu Xingxuan, eventually falling into Luo Chen’s hands.

Wang Lie guessed correctly but never imagined the man before him was Fu Xingxuan’s husband.

“Wang Xiong, I’ll be honest—my experience is the same as yours!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his eyes showing bitterness.

“Back then, a servant of my so-called elder brother coveted her jade and attacked her.”

“I fell for her at first sight!”

“I was present but lacked the strength to stop it, watching helplessly as she fled from Luo Bai!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes filled with pain.

Luo Tian’s pain was real—pain over his wife being hunted, powerless to help.

“Later, Luo Bai returned with the jade. I never expected she was rescued by you!”

“No lie, Luo Bai pretended to be my brother but treated me like a dog. Brotherly bonds were just for show!”

“Thus, I vowed to avenge her—this is why the events earlier occurred!”

“I differ from you, Wang Xiong—I only saw her once and watched her flee.”

“Wang Xiong, accept my bow in gratitude for saving her!” Luo Tian stood, bowing deeply.

If Luo Tian had known Wang Lie rescued Fu Xingxuan, he would not have treated him so harshly. Perhaps he’d have given Wang Lie the Rebirth Palace slot to repay his kindness.

“Luo Xiong, rise! You’re a kindred spirit!” Wang Lie, moved by Luo Tian’s words, felt sympathy for him. He knew Fu Xingxuan’s name and could aid her.

Luo Tian also felt sympathy for Wang Lie—Fu Xingxuan was his wife, and ultimately, Wang Lie would grieve.

“Destined to grieve!” Luo Tian was helped up by Wang Lie, their bond deepened.

Luo Tian now understood why Fu Xingxuan’s admirers had opposed him in the Star Moon Divine Clan. His situation mirrored Wang Lie’s.

“Luo Xiong, you go to the Rebirth Palace first—I’ll arrive later. I need my father to arrange connections!”

“With her beauty and status as a Holy Maiden, she’ll surely draw many admirers in the Rebirth Palace. We’ll unite to drive them away!”

“Hm.” Luo Tian felt odd; Wang Lie called Fu Xingxuan “Xingxuan,” which unsettled him. Yet he could only nod, never expecting to ally with Fu Xingxuan’s admirer and address him as brother.

They clinked cups again until late night, Wang Lie staggering out of Luo Tian’s residence, calling him brother.

“Is that the Young Master?”
“That’s Wang Lie? He hasn’t left yet?” The Luo clan murmured, watching the two exit the mansion.

“Indeed, the Young Master—even Wang Lie, the Prince, is his brother!” They whispered, then watched Luo Tian send Wang Lie off, returning to the courtyard.

Cultivation techniques activated; Luo Tian regained clarity, his eyes alight with joy as he whispered, “Rebirth Palace!”

In the following days, Luo Tian did not leave the Luo clan. Luoshui had yet to recover, and he was uneasy. Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu were taken by clan elders, but the cost remained known only to Luoshui. The family heads left pale-faced, and some even heard scolding at home.

The news of Luo Tian’s Heavenly Net Poison being cured spread like wildfire through the Beast Ghost King City.

The entire city trembled—no one expected Luo Tian, deemed dead, to have recovered and dominated all the city’s prodigies.

The title of “First Among Young Generations” now belonged to Luo Tian, universally acknowledged. Wang Lie had never held it; only his elder brother Wang Gang had.

Luo Tian’s fame soared, and the Luo clan rose with him. As a Rebirth Palace disciple and with the Ghost-Beast Pills, they overshadowed two other families.

More importantly, the Beast Ghost King’s stance mattered. Wang Lie, his son, had come to show goodwill. The Luo clan’s momentum was too strong; normally, the Beast Ghost King would suppress it, but this time he had tacitly allowed it.

A month later, the Luo clan’s gates saw a group standing there. Luoshui smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

A month had passed; under his care, Luoshui had recovered fully. Luo Tian chose to depart for the Rebirth Palace. If not for Luoshui, he would have left earlier—his longing to meet Fu Xingxuan and Zhang Ziping was urgent.

“Be careful on the journey. Though your strength is great, Hell’s environment is treacherous. Some places even threaten仙王 (Immortal Kings). Avoid certain cities—Hell’s cultivators are strange, some even ghosts.” Luoshui repeatedly warned, his voice filled with concern.

“Hm.” Luo Tian felt warmth; a smile graced his face. Though Hell was perilous, with strange individuals who killed on a whim, Luo Tian was no longer the same. With his Intermediate Immortal King strength, he confidently believed he could match an Advanced Immortal King.

“Go. If you establish yourself in the Rebirth Palace, it’ll benefit our clan. As for Tiangui King (Heavenly Ghost King), don’t worry—he won’t harm our clan here.” Luoshui reassured, calming Luo Tian.

“Goodbye, Young Master! Take care in the Rebirth Palace!” The Luo clan members spoke, their voices filled with concern. During this time, Luo Tian’s status within the clan had solidified completely.

“Goodbye!” Luo Tian spoke softly; he knew this departure might mean no return for a long time.

Luo Tian knew the阎罗十殿 (Ten Judges of the Underworld) held a teleportation array to Hell’s gates, so he might directly use it to enter the gates and return to Btiancheng (Heaven’s City).

As he left, Luo Tian gifted his Dragon-Soaring Sword to Luoshui and entrusted him with the “One Sword Against Immortals” technique, along with many pills.

Luo Tian soared into the sky, becoming a long rainbow streak toward the Beast Ghost King City’s gates, vanishing from the Luo clan’s sight.

“Master, may your journey be smooth!” Zhang Menlie watched Luo Tian depart, his eyes filled with sorrow. Their time together had made him realize Luo Tian never treated him as a servant.

Thanks to Luo Tian, Zhang Menlie now received special care within the clan; Luoshui had taken him under his wing, hinting at Zhang Menlie’s potential to succeed as the next steward.

“Xiaodao, I’m uneasy—don’t return to Kanmen (Canyon Gate) too soon,” Luoshui sighed, guessing Luo Tian’s identity when he handed over the pills. Yet in his eyes, Luo Tian was his son.

Luoshui also knew this parting might be indefinite, perhaps even on the battlefield.

“Alright.” Chen Dao nodded, his figure gradually vanishing from Luoshui’s back.

An hour later, Luo Tian exited the Beast Ghost King City, his face filled with awe as he gazed at the vast city before heading south.

Chapter 2108: Reencounter with the Ghost King()

Hell was vast, its core being the central region—eighteen layers ruled by the Ten Judges of the Underworld.

Legends say Hell is a prison, hence its strong-willed beings seek to break free through the nine ghost gates into the Immortal realm, sparking wars.

Luo Tian walked under dim skies, finally understanding Hell’s barrenness—conditions unfit for plant life. Thus, no vegetation existed; instead, he saw bones and flesh-eating ghosts.

“Reaching the Ten Judges of the Underworld takes a month!” Luo Tian alternated between flying and walking.

Just two or three days into his journey, a figure arrived at the Beast Ghost King City, smiling.

“I heard this city has a Luo Chen—could he be the one I seek?” The youth smiled, his back bearing a long spear radiating coldness. This was Yang Huanyu.

“Finding an Extreme Dao Immortal Soul is truly challenging!” Yang Huanyu mused, still at the threshold of an Immortal King. Without finding an Extreme Dao Soul to fuse with, he remained at this level.

Yang Huanyu placed his hopes on the city’s prodigies, hoping to kill one or two Extreme Dao Immortals for their souls.

“Has he gone to the Rebirth Palace? I’ll check other cities too!” Yang Huanyu listened to people’s murmurs, noticing others’ greed for his spear. He ignored it and left the Beast Ghost King City.

Yang Huanyu’s departure saw several figures trailing him, their eyes fierce.

Yang Huanyu seemed oblivious, exiting the city and heading south.

As he left, Yang Huanyu smiled, pressing an incantation into his spear, releasing ghostly qi.

“Sss…” Several black snakes appeared behind the followers, silently consuming them.

…

In a dark forest, Luo Tian walked. Night had fallen; no light remained. The forest held floating green ghost fires—dead people’s hair naturally forming them.

“Pass through this forest and rest,” Luo Tian muttered, sensing the silence and radiating his aura and spiritual sense to震慑 (intimidate) low-level ghosts.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian walked, a sound of breaking air echoed overhead, prompting him to vanish.

Black light appeared; two figures materialized in the forest. Both wore black robes, their auras formidable.

“Front is Tiansha City (Heavenly Slaughter). Hurry—we can reach it before dawn!” A raspy voice spoke, its tone cold.

Luo Tian observed the two and instantly recognized them as not human—two flesh-eating ghosts. His eyes showed surprise.

Flesh-eating ghosts were numerous, living in groups but rarely reaching Immortal King levels. These two had achieved it, piquing Luo Tian’s interest.

They wore black robes, moving through the forest. Luo Tian had intended to enter Tiansha City, so he stealthily followed them.

Time passed slowly; the two ghosts exited the forest and took to the skies, flying swiftly.

Two hours passed—Luo Tian followed them into the hidden Tiansha City.

Tiansha City was the first major city Luo Tian encountered after days of travel, but he halted before entering, sensing death qi outside.

He stood still, gazing at the black city, its form like a giant mouth ready to devour.

An hour passed; Luo Tian saw several groups entering the city, but none were human—each was a ghost.

“Should I take a detour?” Luo Tian mused, sensing danger. Luoshui had warned him to avoid dangerous cities.

Yet Luo Tian decided against the risk; his life was precious, and he didn’t want to die here.

But as Luo Tian prepared to leave, a familiar figure appeared in his view.

“Ghost King!” Luo Tian almost shouted but restrained himself, staring at the Ghost King who had once aided him. He never expected to meet him here.

Initially, Luo Tian felt the Ghost King was no ordinary being, though he had submitted to the three-headed dog’s tyranny. Yet Luo Tian never discerned his true form.

Only after using the Ghost King’s blood to cultivate the Tai Xu Hunting Beast did Luo Tian begin to suspect, though he remained uncertain.

Now, the Ghost King’s strength had risen further—his aura was far stronger than other ghosts.

“Why is he here?” Luo Tian puzzled, unable to guess. He waited silently for an opportunity to speak with the Ghost King.

As Luo Tian anxiously awaited, the Ghost King finally moved, his eyes filled with confusion. He slowly approached Luo Tian.

“Can he see me?” Luo Tian’s heart jolted, but he remained still, watching the Ghost King head toward him.

The Ghost King moved faster, as if seeing Luo Tian, rushing toward his hiding spot.

“You’re here?” Both Luo Tian and the Ghost King spoke simultaneously, their voices laced with confusion.

“I’m passing through—going to the Rebirth Palace!” Luo Tian replied, gazing at the Ghost King.

“I was captured!” The Ghost King’s eyes gleamed with light, then he spoke bitterly.

“This Tiansha City houses a True Immortal King-level ghost—Bloodthirsty Ghost. This creature is bloodthirsty, capturing ghosts to fetch humans for its blood absorption, strengthening itself.”

“It’s like how you humans raise ghosts—Bloodthirsty Ghost treats humans as livestock, food.”

“After parting from you, I wandered alone. When I arrived here, I was captured by this Bloodthirsty Ghost.” The Ghost King spoke softly.

“Also, I saw someone you know here—Yechen!” The Ghost King continued briefly.

“Yechen is here?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, his expression darkening.

For Yechen, this was crucial. If he truly saw Yechen imprisoned here and ignored it, Luo Tian’s conscience would trouble him.

But a True Immortal King-level ghost was beyond his current strength; he could only devise plans, not confront it directly.

“Take a detour—should you be discovered, they’ll capture you too!”

“This Bloodthirsty Ghost is cunning. Recently, a Rebirth Palace disciple passed through here; the ghost hid until they left before reappearing.” The Ghost King spoke.

“Does it have any weaknesses?” Luo Tian asked, his eyes deepening. The Ghost King’s strength was formidable; he must hold a high position in Tiansha City.

“Weaknesses? There are, but this Bloodthirsty Ghost cultivates a technique requiring regular blood absorption. Without it, his strength drops significantly.” The Ghost King replied.

“Good—now I have a plan!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed calculation, then he gazed at the Ghost King.

“Ghost King Elder, I’ll think of a way—wait for my news.” Luo Tian addressed the Ghost King, then pressed his hand, sending a black True Immortal King energy into the Ghost King’s body.

Luo Tian could see the Ghost King had a restriction within him; this energy could, at critical moments, transform into four dragons and four tigers to subdue him.

“From now on, don’t call me Ghost King—my name is Huang Bai Shui (Yellow White Water)!” The Ghost King spoke softly, then his forehead glowed red. His face shifted slightly: “I’ll return tomorrow at this time—see you then!”

The Ghost King’s figure flew toward Tiansha City, leaving Luo Tian alone.

“Who are you?” As Luo Tian watched the Ghost King leave, a black figure appeared behind him, shouting.

Luo Tian turned, seeing the figure. The figure saw Luo Tian and immediately changed expression, shouting.

But before he could finish, Luo Tian’s hand clamped his neck, squeezing it until the sound was stifled.

“Boom…” Black qi flowed from Luo Tian’s fingertips, a wisp flying toward Tiansha City.

“Let you escape—how can I survive?” Luo Tian spoke softly, then sucked in a powerful force, drawing the black qi to his front.

“Sss…” Seven-color flames erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, enveloping the black qi.

Chapter 2109: First Step of the Plan()

Seven-color flames enveloped the black qi, which transformed into a face in the fire. The face cried out: “Pardon me, Master!” Its spirit trembled at the flame’s cage. The flames inherently suppressed ghosts; this seven-color fire made it feel that even a touch would turn to ash.

“Are you also from Tiansha City?” Luo Tian asked softly, as the Ghost King had left too quickly for him to inquire about city details.

“Yes, Master—I don’t wish to offend you!” The face spoke hurriedly, bowing to Luo Tian.

“Speak—tell me everything you know about Tiansha City!” Luo Tian addressed the face.

“Master, rest assured—I’ll tell you everything I know!” The ghostly face spoke, its voice eager.

“Half a year ago, the Bloodthirsty Ghost suddenly arrived in Tiansha City, killed the city’s original ruler, and became the new master. The people suffered, but ghosts fared better—only restricted by the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s curse, yet allowed free movement as long as they captured passersby.”

“But humans fared worse—confined in dungeons, raised for the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s blood absorption…” The ghost spoke endlessly, recounting Tiansha City’s affairs. Perhaps the seven-color flames’ pressure was too great; he spoke for an hour, even detailing how many toilets were in the city hall.

“Master, it’s not just people who suffer—ghosts do too, restricted from freedom. My poor Xiaohua was even taken by a subordinate of the Tiansha Ghost…” The ghost spoke endlessly, and Luo Tian had not even asked.

“Silence!” Luo Tian commanded, startling the ghost into silence.

“Don’t resist!” Luo Tian grabbed the face, flames dissolving. The black ghost face was in his hand.

“Soul-search!” Luo Tian initiated a soul search on the ghost. If it spoke truth, he would release it; if false, he’d kill it.

“Playing with me?” The ghost felt his dignity wounded; the other could have soul-searched but let him speak for so long, fearing he’d say wrong or too little.

“Hum…” Yet the ghost immediately stopped resisting, allowing Luo Tian to search his memories.

In a moment, Luo Tian completed the soul-search, confirming the ghost’s truthfulness. He pressed his hand, using the Dragon and Elephant Sealing Technique to imprint it on the ghost’s body, erasing its mark.

Luo Tian guessed this ghost held low status in Tiansha City; the Bloodthirsty Ghost wouldn’t care much for it. Erasing its mark would likely go unnoticed.

“Thank you, Master… Thank you!” The ghost’s eyes lit up with joy at the mark’s disappearance. Few ghosts would stay under the Bloodthirsty Ghost without it.

“You’ll have to endure a little longer—I can’t let you go yet!” Luo Tian grabbed the ghost, sealing it. He couldn’t risk any mishaps.

“Like fresh blood?” Luo Tian quickly obtained an important clue from the ghost: the Bloodthirsty Ghost loved fresh blood, always absorbing it upon capturing new victims.

Luo Tian whispered, a plan forming in his mind, gradually refining it despite its danger. He would gamble.

A day passed. The next night, Huang Bai Shui arrived as promised, meeting Luo Tian. He explained his plan to Huang Bai Shui.

“Our goal is to survive its weakness period—once it drops to a True Immortal King level, we’ll have won!” Luo Tian’s face showed seriousness.

“Is it too dangerous? If we can’t wait, we’ll be in trouble!” Huang Bai Shui spoke, his gaze showing concern.

“It should be fine,” Luo Tian said calmly, finalizing the plan.

“Good—let’s proceed as you planned!” Huang Bai Shui spoke, then vanished into the night. Luo Tian also flew toward the previous forest.

Another day passed; Luo Tian sat in meditation within the forest, and as night fell, he opened his eyes.
