“Indeed!” Luo Tian’s heart tightened as he gave a slight bow. At this moment, he finally understood the status of Luo Chen within the Luo family.

“Uncle Ping, my younger brother has just returned. Please show him some leniency and let him off this time. My younger brother’s journey was for my sake!” As Luo Tian’s words finished, a voice echoed from the crowd. A young man stepped forward and approached Luo Tian, addressing Uncle Ping.

“Master Luo Bai!” The people quickly bowed in reverence. Their treatment of the young man was entirely different from how they treated Luo Tian, their gazes filled with respect.

Dressed in black robes, his face pale and smooth, long dark hair flowing like a river of ink. His eyes were sharp and full of vitality. Though young, he radiated an imposing aura, a ruler’s presence.

This man was the first prodigy of the Luo family—Luo Bai, and also Luo Chen’s half-brother.

“Truly a formidable individual,” Luo Tian thought, feeling a sense of danger from Luo Bai’s presence.

“Brother, are you alright? Did you get hurt? If you did, I’ll lead people to kill the Zhang family!” Luo Bai spoke loudly, his voice filled with concern as he scrutinized Luo Tian.

“Elder Brother, I’m fine!” Luo Tian replied, his eyes filled with deep gratitude as he looked at Luo Chen.

“Uncle Ping, if you insist on punishing my younger brother, I’ll take his punishment instead!” Luo Bai declared firmly.

“Hmph… then…” Uncle Ping nodded. Though Luo Bai was his junior, he would soon be the family’s patriarch—this was almost certain. Thus, Uncle Ping naturally had to grant Luo Bai this favor.

“But that’s not good…” Before Uncle Ping could finish his words, a youthful voice echoed in the crowd.

“Elder Brother, it was I who provoked this. I should bear the punishment. Since my body is severely wounded, let me take the punishment with you. I would be most grateful, Elder Brother! You truly are a good elder brother!” Luo Tian spoke loudly without giving the two a chance to respond.

“Elder Brother, I’ll accompany you. We brothers will face the wall of ghosts together!” After speaking, Luo Tian spat out two more mouthfuls of blood. His body exuded a weak aura. Upon entering the Luo family, he had suppressed his cultivation to just beyond the Immortal stage.

“This…” The people were stunned. None expected the second son, who rarely spoke, to say such words.

“Elder Brother, go to the Wall of Ghosts first. I’ll return to recover for a day. After that, I’ll come find you at the Wall of Ghosts!” Luo Tian spoke loudly before giving a meaningful glance to Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie, then walking into the courtyard.

“Second Master, when did you become so eloquent?” The people murmured lowly, watching Luo Tian leave with Zhang Menlie and Liu Cheng.

“My unworthy younger brother, after going out, seems to have changed,” Luo Chen’s eyes held a deep gaze.

“A discarded pawn. Nothing remarkable. Even if he knew something, it wouldn’t change his fate!” Uncle Ping spoke softly, his voice laced with disdain.

“I’m going to the Wall of Ghosts. Remember to remind him to meet me there after a day!” Luo Chen’s eyes smiled as he addressed the crowd.

“Yes!” Though no one knew why Luo Bai was going to the Wall of Ghosts, they all understood that he had his own purpose.

Chapter 2071: Beating People

The news spread quickly through the Luo family that the second son, Luo Chen, had returned. Everyone was surprised. None expected Luo Chen to return unscathed. After all, everyone knew that although Luo Bai appeared as a kind elder brother to Luo Chen, he secretly ordered people to suppress him.

“Pity for the second son. Both are sons of the clan leader, yet his treatment is so different!” Some members of the Luo family felt sorry for Luo Chen but dared to speak out. Now, Luo Bai was at his peak; even the elder generation gave him some respect.

In a dilapidated courtyard, Luo Tian stood there. This was where Luo Chen had once lived. Compared to the luxury of the entire Luo family, this place was even worse than what servants received.

“Pity. Luo Chen was wise all his life, devoting himself to studying the Soul-Feeding Elixir. Yet he never thought about why he lived here. If his elder brother truly cared for him, would he allow his younger brother to live in such an environment?” Luo Tian sighed deeply.

“Not yet the time for high-profile actions. I need to see how the family’s upper echelons will react. If they all favor Luo Bai, it’ll be difficult. But if Luo Chen’s talent surpasses Luo Bai and catches the old ancestor’s attention, it’ll be much simpler. Then I can defeat Luo Bai thoroughly in the competition!” Luo Tian stood alone in the courtyard, thinking.

Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie were dispatched by Luo Tian to gather information. Upon arriving at the Luo family, it was essential to learn more about the family.

Pushing open a dusty door, dust immediately swirled into the room, making Luo Tian cough.

“Hum…” Luo Tian extended his hand, and water surged forth. The waves washed the entire room clean in an instant. Though Luo Tian didn’t care about the room’s condition, he felt a pang of sorrow at its simplicity.

The room had no decorations. Just a wooden bed, and even the windows were broken.

“I heard Luo Chen lived here as a child!” Luo Tian sighed, envisioning the young Luo Chen shivering on this bed.

“Did his father do nothing?” Luo Tian muttered, feeling sympathy for Luo Chen. Though he had been an orphan, he was adopted by foster parents.

But Luo Chen had a father who lived in a large courtyard. Why did he live in such an environment? His father must have known.

“Regardless, Luo Chen is your blood!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, already defining Luo Chen’s father as no good.

As he sighed, Luo Tian stepped out of the room and headed toward the place where supplies were distributed. He wanted to exchange for a furnace, as using the Tianji Flame Furnace would be too conspicuous.

“Is that not Master Luo Chen? How come he left the house?” As people pointed and whispered, Luo Chen arrived at the supply exchange.

Upon entering the hall, Luo Tian immediately drew attention. However, many faces bore disdain while others showed sympathy.

“Dust Master, what wind brought you here today?” A young man stood behind the counter, his disdain fleeting before addressing Luo Tian.

“I’ve come to claim my supplies!” Luo Tian spoke softly, as if not noticing the young man’s disdain.

“Dust Master, did you get hit on the head during your trip?”

“You received supplies last month, didn’t you?” The young man laughed and scolded immediately.

“Last month I didn’t return. How could I claim supplies?” Luo Tian replied, placing his token on the counter.

“It was Master Luo Hong who claimed them for you,” the young man coldly replied, his eyes watching Luo Tian.

As a legitimate son, Luo Chen naturally had supplies to claim. Yet for years, he rarely received them—most were taken by others who shared the spoils.

Everyone knew this but turned a blind eye.

“Smack!” A crisp slap echoed through the hall. The young man was thrown backward, colliding with the wall and spitting blood, his teeth flying out.

Silence. The entire hall fell silent. Everyone stared at Luo Tian standing there, stunned that the usually quiet Dust Master had acted.

“Half-Immortal! His cultivation has reached Half-Immortal!” People soon felt Luo Tian’s aura.

“Dust Master only left two months ago. I clearly remember he was at the Immortal Intermediate stage then. How could he have reached Half-Immortal so quickly?” People’s eyes were filled with disbelief, staring at Luo Tian.

“I am the second son of the Luo family. My elder brother Luo Bai is the next heir to the royal title. My father is also the head of the Luo family. How dare you treat me like this?”

“You’re rebelling against the clan! Do you want to die!”

“A mere servant dares to scold me, even disrespecting my supplies. Who gave you the courage!”

“I’ll ask again—do you give me my things or not!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, his voice like thunder that stunned the people’s minds.

“I…” The young man spat out two teeth, his speech slurred. He stared at Luo Tian but could not speak for a long time—Luo Tian’s aura was too oppressive. Moreover, Luo Tian’s words were true; the accusation of rebelling had terrified him.

“Give it!” Luo Tian slapped his hand on the counter, making the counter vibrate.

“Yes… yes…” The young man nodded quickly. His heart ached as he handed over his supplies to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s supplies had already been taken. Since the family’s items were not something he dared to touch, the young man had no choice but to pay out of his own pocket.

“Exchange all these for a furnace!” Luo Tian sneered, directly ordering the young man to exchange them into furnaces.

Having obtained what he wanted, Luo Tian left the hall satisfied. He feared the family’s upper echelons but had no regard for these servants.

“Master Luo Chen seems to have changed completely!” As soon as Luo Tian left, people murmured loudly.

“This matter will surely be handled by Master Luo Hong!” The young man who had been thrown back glared, his eyes filled with hatred. Now that Luo Tian was gone, the young man regained composure, gently touching his red handprint on his face and gritting his teeth.

Luo Tian returned to the courtyard, where a row of black furnaces stood before him.

In hell, there were no alchemists—only soul-feeders. Thus, furnaces did not exist here. These furnaces were all taken from the gates of hell—loot from ghost cultivators.

Few in hell could use furnaces, so over time, these furnaces became unused and turned black from ghost qi.

“Hum…” Waves of energy radiated from Luo Tian’s hands. A cold ghost aura coalesced in his palm, eventually gathering into the furnace. Luo Tian began to attempt refining the Soul-Feeding Elixir.

As Luo Tian started refining the Soul-Feeding Elixir, news of his trip to the supply hall and beating a servant spread gradually. People were surprised that Luo Chen had changed so much, but the rumors did not concern them—after all, someone would surely trouble Luo Tian.

“What? He dared to hit you! Didn’t he know you’re my man!” In a luxurious courtyard, a young man stood, crushing his teacup in hand. He spoke coldly.

“Master Hong, you didn’t see how arrogant he was. I told him I’m Master Hong’s man, but he not only didn’t back down but even escalated his actions!” The young man who had been thrown back spoke loudly, adding fuel to the fire.

“Let’s go and deal with that bastard. He’s given me enough face!” Luo Hong’s face turned red with anger, slapping the table and standing up.

“Master Hong, should we inform Master Luo Bai first?” The young man felt a surge of hope but still reminded Luo Hong.

“No need. Master Luo Bai will give me some face!” Luo Hong waved his hand and immediately headed toward Luo Tian’s residence.

In another courtyard, a woman with a dark expression listened to her subordinates’ report.

“What! You say that little bastard has returned and even reached Half-Immortal. He went to the supply hall and exchanged for many unused furnaces!” The woman spoke, then screeched.

“What is he trying to do? Does he want to…” Her face turned extremely grim, as if she had thought of something.

“No. If we sever his meridians, he could still come up with the Soul-Feeding Elixir. This bastard must not be left alive. So many useless people, yet none could kill this little bastard. We can’t let him live. We shouldn’t have spared his life back then!” The woman muttered, clenching her fists.

“Mistress, Master Hong has already gone to trouble that kid!” A middle-aged man kneeling on the ground spoke.

“Go. Go and kill him. If we can frame it on Master Hong, that’s best. If not, still kill him!” The woman gritted her teeth, thinking of the things Luo Chen had given to Luo Bai. Her voice was filled with cruelty.

“Yes!” The middle-aged man slowly stood up, his figure vanishing into the hall.

Chapter 2072: The Soul-Feeding Elixir is Forged

In the dilapidated courtyard, Luo Tian’s face was serious. Before him stood a black furnace, and ghostly cries echoed in the air above the courtyard. A powerful ghost aura surged into the black furnace.

Luo Tian’s eyes were serious as his hands moved, channeling divine laws into the furnace. A terrifying aura radiated from it.

“Luo Chen, come out and face me!” As Luo Tian focused on refining the Soul-Feeding Elixir, a furious voice echoed outside the courtyard. The already broken door was shattered by a gust of wind, and several figures rushed into the courtyard with anger.

“Boom…” As they entered, a deafening explosion echoed through heaven and earth. A destructive aura swept toward them.

“Black smoke…” Dense black smoke surged forward, striking the people.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian emerged from the dust, his face covered in soot. His eyes were filled with anger as he stepped toward the people who had been blown over.

“Who are you? Daring to disturb my refining! Do you want to die!” Luo Tian roared, punching a dark-faced young man.

If it were before, Luo Tian could have recognized the young man who had come to trouble him. But now, everyone was black-faced; he couldn’t recognize them.

“Boom…” The punch landed, and the young man was smashed in the face, collapsing to the ground.

“Luo Chen, you’re asking for death! You used underhanded means to injure me!” A furious voice echoed, and a figure stood up, shouting at Luo Tian.

“Smack…”

“I’ll teach you to insult me!” Without hesitation, Luo Tian slapped the injured man’s face.

“Smack… smack…” Luo Tian continued to strike, his slaps landing on the man’s dark face.

This man was Luo Hong. Originally at the Immortal Initial stage, he shouldn’t have been so weak. He should have fought back.

But the explosion was too sudden, completely stunning Luo Hong. Luo Tian’s attack was fast and immediate, finding the leader and striking repeatedly, leaving Luo Hong stunned.

The slaps continued. Luo Hong’s men were also shocked, not expecting Luo Hong to be beaten so severely.

“Half-Immortal! Luo Chen is no longer the small Immortal Intermediate he once was. Now, he’s at Half-Immortal!” The men thought in awe. In their minds, Luo Chen had always been a soft target—just an Immortal Intermediate.

“Luo Chen, you’re asking for death!”

“Quickly let go of Master Hong!” The men, seeing Luo Hong so beaten, finally erupted and rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Liu Cheng, Zhang Menlie, return quickly!” Luo Tian sent a mental message to the two. Some things he couldn’t yet handle.

At this moment, Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie were also gathering information in the Luo family’s territory. The more they investigated, the more bitter their hearts became.

“I wish I hadn’t rushed to come with him to this Beast King City!” Liu Cheng thought bitterly, regretting his decision to follow Luo Chen.

Originally, he had thought following Luo Chen would bring him luxury and comfort. But after investigating, Liu Cheng learned of Luo Chen’s situation.

“Master, in this Luo family, even servants are better than him…” Liu Cheng felt bitter and received Luo Tian’s message. He flew toward Luo Chen’s courtyard.

“Sigh… no matter what, he is my lifeline. I know if I left the Luo family now, I’d be hunted like a dog!” Zhang Menlie thought to himself, his eyes filled with determination. He had no other path.

Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie returned to the dilapidated courtyard, witnessing Luo Tian being beaten.

“You two, fight for me. As long as you don’t kill him, it’s fine. After all, my elder brother is Luo Bai!” Luo Tian told Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie.

“Yes…” Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie nodded. Their cultivation levels were high—Liu Cheng at Immortal Intermediate, Zhang Menlie previously a genius of the Zhang family. With several Half-Immortals and one Immortal Initial, they were no match for the two.

In an instant, the men lay battered and unconscious on the ground.

“A hidden figure sensed this. He thought to himself, then vanished from the courtyard.”

“Troublesome…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He naturally felt someone outside the courtyard.

But he didn’t call out to them. The hidden figure was at Immortal Intermediate, and Luo Tian didn’t know the upper echelons’ attitude toward him.

“However, Luo Chen is a legitimate son. If he truly died in the Luo family, people would investigate. Otherwise, Luo Bai wouldn’t have chosen to kill him outside!” Luo Tian quickly understood the situation, his eyes glowing with determination.

“You two guard me. If anyone else comes to trouble me, fight them—don’t kill them. Since my elder brother loves me so much, how can I not be a spoiled brat? Remember to blame it on my elder brother after fighting!” Luo Tian smiled, then turned back to refining the Soul-Feeding Elixir.

“No problem with the hand signs. No issue with the ghost qi’s flow and gathering. My spiritual sense is definitely stronger than Luo Chen’s. Why can’t I refine the Soul-Feeding Elixir?” Luo Tian immersed himself in refining the elixir again.

The sound of explosions kept rising from Luo Tian’s courtyard. As he delved into refining the Soul-Feeding Elixir, news of Luo Hong and others being beaten by Luo Tian spread through the Luo family.

But the Luo family members didn’t take it too seriously. Everyone knew that Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie had been brought in by Luo Chen.

Their strength was known. One at Immortal Intermediate, one at Immortal Initial—beating an Immortal Initial and several Half-Immortals was nothing.

What shocked people was Luo Tian’s boldness. He had always been the one bullied, but this time he had injured people.

On a black cliff, cold air swept across it. Luo Bai sat on the peak.

“My unworthy younger brother has truly become this strong?” Luo Bai smiled, listening to the report.

“Master, Luo Chen’s two subordinates spread that Luo Chen is your real younger brother. They blamed everyone they beat on you, claiming it was you who ordered it!”

“Also, we had told him to come to the Wall of Ghosts for punishment. He refused with an excuse that he wasn’t fully recovered!”

The reporter continued, recounting Luo Tian’s situation over the past few days.

“He’s smart. He knows to use my name as a shield. Unfortunately, he’s no longer valuable to me. Let him cause trouble. Tell my mother not to bother him either. Now, killing him would be hard to explain to my father!”

“Once the family competition comes, I’ll accidentally kill him. That way, everyone’s face is saved! These days, I’ve been pushing to Immortal Intermediate. Don’t disturb me anymore!” Luo Bai spoke softly and then flew away from the cold cliff.

Time passed slowly. With less than ten days until the Luo family’s competition, news of Luo Hong and others being beaten by Luo Tian gradually faded. Everyone began discussing the family competition.

“Hum…” Waves of energy rose from Luo Tian’s courtyard. His eyes were red. These past ten days, he hadn’t rested at all, constantly refining the Soul-Feeding Elixir.

“I understand! I understand!”

“Luo Chen succeeded because he never refined any elixir. His knowledge of elixirs came from a jade slip. But I am an alchemist, instinctively treating this Soul-Feeding Elixir as a regular elixir. But this Soul-Feeding Elixir isn’t an actual elixir!” Luo Tian thought to himself, then his hands moved swiftly.

“Boom… boom…” Explosions echoed. Ghosts roared. A terrifying suction force spread from the black furnace, and Luo Tian no longer used any elixir refining techniques. He even forgot he was an alchemist!

“Boom…” The furnace’s lid flew open, and a black elixir shot out, landing in Luo Tian’s hand.

“This…” Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie’s faces showed disbelief. They could feel the elixir contained ghost qi far exceeding that of a ghost pearl.

Liu Cheng, as a ghost creature, instinctively felt an urge to devour the black elixir.

“This…” Zhang Menlie’s eyes showed intense shock. He had never seen such hand signs before, which differed greatly from traditional soul-feeders’ methods of refining ghost pearls.

“Now I’m also an Xuan Grade Soul-Feeder. Unfortunately, the hand signs after Xuan Grade weren’t left by Luo Chen—he gave them all to his good elder brother, Luo Bai!” Luo Tian thought to himself. He extended his hand and sent the elixir to Liu Cheng.

“I won’t deceive you this time!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Liu Cheng.

“Thank you, Master!” Liu Cheng didn’t hesitate. The instinctual desire compelled him to swallow the black elixir.

As soon as Liu Cheng swallowed it, his face changed abruptly. He immediately sat cross-legged, and ghost qi seeped out of his body, covering him.

“Food-Consuming Ghosts are naturally skilled at devouring ghost qi. Liu Cheng can’t even refine it!” Zhang Menlie’s face showed shock, looking at Liu Cheng refining the ghost qi and exclaiming.

“Want to learn? I’ll teach you!” Luo Tian’s eyes also showed satisfaction. He then began refining more Xuan Grade Soul-Feeding Elixirs, aiming to grow the Void-Tearing Ghost Beast to Immortal Peak.

Chapter 2073: Luo Chen’s Father

With less than three days until the Luo family competition, the family was lively. Everyone was eager to win good rankings in the family competition and gain the rewards.

Bianhong Flowers are famous holy flowers in hell. Their effect is extremely powerful—they can elevate ghost creatures.

Yellow Grade ghosts eating Bianhong Flowers can advance to Xuan Grade. Xuan Grade ghosts eating them can reach Di Grade. Di Grade ghosts can become Tian Grade. Tian Grade ghosts represent the ability to ascend to Half-Immortal King status.

However, it can only reach Tian Grade. It cannot become a King Beast. Each King Beast in the Immortal world is almost unique, impossible to raise through human means.

These days, Luo Tian continuously refined Soul-Feeding Elixirs, pushing the Void-Tearing Ghost Beast to Half-Immortal.

Liu Cheng was also excited these days. Occasionally, Luo Tian would give him an elixir to improve his strength.

Luo Tian didn’t reward too much because he felt the power of the Soul-Controlling Seal had loosened. He was worried that if Liu Cheng improved too much, he might break free from his control.

During this time, Luo Tian noticed that Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie had different attitudes. Zhang Menlie had fully pledged himself to Luo Tian, but Liu Cheng seemed reluctant to stay with Luo Tian. However, it was the Soul-Controlling Seal that kept him by his side.

“Master, your biggest opponent in this family competition is definitely Luo Bai. Besides Luo Bai, there are several others who are very strong—Luo Hu and Luo Long. These two can rank in the top three within the Luo family!” Zhang Menlie spoke softly, as he had lived in the Beast King City before and was familiar with the three major families’ geniuses.

“However, your strength naturally surpasses Luo Hu and Luo Long. Even Luo Bai won’t be a match for you!” Zhang Menlie didn’t hesitate to flatter Luo Tian.

“Still, be careful. Luo Bai has a great reputation in the three major families of the Beast King City! Although Chen Tiansheng is strong, he was defeated by Luo Tian in four moves!” Zhang Menlie reminded Luo Tian again.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, not taking it too seriously. With his current strength, he could handle anyone below Immortal Peak.

“Master Luo Chen, the family head requests your presence!” A middle-aged man appeared at the courtyard’s entrance. His voice was cold as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Luo Shui!” Hearing the middle-aged man’s words, Luo Tian immediately thought of a person—Luo Shui, the family head.

“Master?” Luo Tian quickly heard the middle-aged man call him “master.”

The middle-aged man was tall, dressed in black robes. His eyes were deep and his aura restrained. However, Luo Tian sensed the man’s Immortal Peak strength.

Luo Tian didn’t respond but walked out of the courtyard, following the middle-aged man toward the clan leader’s direction.

An hour later, a courtyard appeared in Luo Tian’s view. Before entering, a loud cough echoed from the courtyard.

The middle-aged man pushed open the door and gestured for Luo Tian to enter. He remained outside, like a guard.

Luo Tian felt puzzled and entered the courtyard. The place was not luxurious but very tranquil, with items that were not ordinary.

As Luo Tian approached the central house, the black door slowly opened. A middle-aged man stepped out.

This man resembled Luo Chen slightly. His aura was powerful, but it felt hollow and insubstantial.

“Hearing you’ve been quite bold lately, causing trouble everywhere?” The man spoke softly, his voice carrying authority. He scrutinized Luo Tian.

Luo Tian said nothing but gazed at the man, waiting for his next words.

“Stay in line. Don’t cause trouble. Know your place. Don’t think about things you shouldn’t!” The man scolded, his aura of Immortal Peak bursting out and pressing toward Luo Tian.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian cooperated, stepping back. His eyes showed fear and he bit his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

“Yes!” Luo Tian felt cold. He clenched his fists slightly.

“Sometimes, living a simple life might allow you to live longer!” The man sighed deeply. This made Luo Tian’s heart tremble slightly.

“Is this concern?” Luo Tian wondered, exchanging a glance with the man. Their gazes met, and Luo Tian’s mind trembled slightly.

“Go back. Remember what I said. Stay in your place!” The authoritative voice echoed, and Luo Shui waved his sleeve, turning to walk into the room.

“Father, do you have a reason?” Luo Tian spoke softly. This “father” was for Luo Chen.

Luo Tian could feel that Luo Shui might have some reason. A tiger wouldn’t eat its young, and he didn’t believe that Luo Chen’s hardships were ignored by his father.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Luo Shui’s body slightly trembled but he said nothing. Instead, he coldly replied: “What reason do I have? Don’t lose your life!”

“If I defeat Luo Bai in the competition?” Luo Tian spoke again, his voice resolute. At this point, he had confirmed that Luo Shui indeed had a reason.

Back then, Luo Nan Tian and his wife hadn’t cared for Luo Tian either. They let him live on his own.

“That’s your brother, the future clan leader. Even if you defeat Bai, it won’t benefit you!”

“Moreover, Bai’s strength is something you know. You can’t defeat him!” Luo Shui spoke seriously, turning to face Luo Tian, his eyes flashing with sharpness.

“I said I’ll defeat him in the competition!” Luo Tian spoke again, his voice resolute.

“It’s impossible. If you can defeat him…” Luo Shui frowned slightly but shook his head.

“What will happen? Will I die?” Luo Tian spoke seriously, locking eyes with Luo Shui.

“First defeat him. Tomorrow is your mother’s memorial day. Go and pay respects at her tomb!”

“This is the jade pendant she loved most. Take it!” Luo Shui waved his hand, sending a black jade pendant into Luo Tian’s hands.

“Master, how did your mother die?” Luo Tian felt a stir in his heart. Perhaps it was related to Luo Chen’s mother.

“Yes!” Luo Tian bowed slightly and stepped out of the courtyard. He had confirmed that Luo Shui seemed to have no choice.

“His eyes show black qi. His strength is strong, but his middle energy is weak! It shows signs of poisoning!” Luo Tian understood why Luo Shui treated Luo Chen this way.

Luo Tian returned to his dilapidated courtyard and addressed Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie: “These two days, you go investigate my mother’s story. How did she die?”

After giving the order, he sat cross-legged and pondered over Luo Shui’s situation, waiting for Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie to return.

The next day, Liu Cheng and Zhang Menlie returned to Luo Tian’s courtyard. They had gathered the information they found and told it to Luo Tian, who then understood.

Luo Shui had two wives. One was his wife, Duan Peizhen, and the other was Luo Chen’s mother, Fang Lingxue.

Duan Peizhen was a marriage arranged by the Luo family. Fang Lingxue, however, was someone Luo Shui had insisted on marrying into the Luo family.

Duan Peizhen’s background was a daughter of one of the Eight Heavenly Kings, the Ghost King. Fang Lingxue was a daughter from a small family in the Beast King City.

One was a clan marriage, and one was someone Luo Shui had to marry. Naturally, he favored the latter.

However, when Fang Lingxue gave birth to Luo Chen, an accident occurred. She died from childbirth.

At that time, Luo Shui wasn’t the clan leader yet; he was a genius in the Ghost Gate. He was fighting with the Supplemental City when he returned, only to find Fang Lingxue’s tomb.

It was then that Luo Chen’s ghost meridian was removed. After returning, Luo Shui no longer favored Luo Chen and let him live on his own.

“Ah! I see now!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He knew that Fang Lingxue’s death might be related to Duan Peizhen, but Duan Peizhen was the daughter of the Ghost King. Though the Ghost King had many offspring, she was still his daughter.

“To protect Luo Chen!” Luo Tian quickly realized the key. It was Luo Shui’s coldness that allowed Luo Chen to grow into this. Otherwise, with Duan Peizhen’s personality, Luo Chen might not have survived until now.

“Unfortunately, Luo Chen has already died!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He made a decision and sat cross-legged again.

“This jade pendant…” Luo Tian waved his hand, and the black jade pendant fell into his palm. When he received it, a martial art name flashed in his mind.

“Hellfire Ghost Claws—Immortal High-Grade Martial Art!” Luo Tian muttered, a smile on his face. He was thinking about acquiring some martial arts since he had limited means in hell.

...

Three days passed quietly. Besides visiting his mother’s tomb once, Luo Tian focused on refining the Ghost Claws.

“Boom…” The heavy bell rang, awakening everyone in the Luo family. All rushed toward the Luo family’s square.

“My unworthy younger brother, today you should be sent to your death!” Luo Bai smiled and stood up.

“Luo Chen, the insult you gave me today will cost you your life!” Luo Hong’s face showed excitement. He thought of the person he had sought.

Chapter 2075: What is this thing?

On the square, figures stood there. A fierce aura radiated from their hands.

A roar erupted from a young man’s hand. In the next moment, a humanoid figure appeared beside him, its black body covered in jagged edges and radiating cold light.
