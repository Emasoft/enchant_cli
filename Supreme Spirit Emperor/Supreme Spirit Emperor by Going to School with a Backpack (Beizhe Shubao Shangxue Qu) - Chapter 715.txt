“Xumishan is formidable, and that Buddha is equally powerful. I suspect my father is concealing something from me!” Having exited the black desert’s bounds, the two stood upon the golden sands. Yao Chen addressed Luo Tian.

“Let it be, the Immortal King’s peak—your father need not worry. None could threaten him!” Luo Tian replied.

The two flew along the route guided by Yao Chen, heading beyond the desert.

After three days of flight, they finally emerged from the desert, gradually spotting an oasis. The rich spiritual energy eased Luo Tian’s discomfort.

“The Eternal Immortal King must be severely wounded!” Luo Tian murmured, exhaling deeply. For three days, they had remained cautious, fearing the Eternal Immortal King might ambush them en route.

Beyond the desert, they transformed into a streak of light, heading toward Eternal Mountain.

“Time has been wasted,” Luo Tian thought anxiously. The Eternal Immortal King had delayed them, and he estimated the time to enter Eternal Mountain would be about five days. Yet, with his conspicuous title of “Ghost Valley,” no one could avoid confronting him.

“I am no longer the Luo Tian of old!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with murder. The two sped toward Eternal Mountain.

Time passed, and to Luo Tian’s surprise, they faced no obstacles at all. Five days later, they reached the mountain’s outskirts without incident.

Chapter 2698: Entering Eternal Mountain

Ancient forests surrounded Luo Tian and Yao Chen, their gazes filled with caution. Eternal Mountain, a forbidden zone of the Immortal realm, demanded vigilance even for an Immortal King’s peak. Within it lay countless opportunities.

“Perhaps the Immortals are preoccupied with settling those from the Three Heavens,” Luo Tian murmured. Along their journey, they encountered some individuals who lacked the strength to hinder them.

“Let’s go!” They adjusted their states and rushed into Eternal Mountain. Upon entry, they abandoned flight; the very moment they stepped in, a force pressed upon them.

“Life-erasing!” Luo Tian’s face lit with amusement. Though the forest differed from when he first entered, he still recognized this power.

“Perhaps I can see the Tree of Time again!” Luo Tian and Yao Chen walked, searching for the water source he had encountered before.

The forest was lifeless; their faces were grim, hearing only the rustling of footsteps. After a day’s walk, they finally heard the sound of flowing water.

“Here!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. At this moment, both had streaks of white hair. He retrieved a time fruit he had left behind, offering it to Yao Chen. He had saved some after picking it but never used them.

After about an hour, they heard the sound of trickling water and spotted a clear stream.

“Swallow the time fruit, then follow the stream—we’ll reach the next place!” Luo Tian urged Yao Chen. He swallowed the fruit and leapt into the water, both swimming downstream.

Time flowed slowly, time losing its definition. Though they could judge how long had passed in a short while, after extended periods, it became unclear.

“What kind of place is this?” Yao Chen marveled, feeling the time fruit’s power clashing with the external force. Without it, even he would have been affected by this force.

They wandered for a long while until the sky darkened, entering a cave and navigating underground rivers.

At last, they reached the spot where Luo Tian had seen the Tree of Time. He leapt upward and landed on the ground, feeling a slight disappointment.

“Continue moving—be cautious!” Luo Tian urged Yao Chen. He knew the next area might be the domain of blood-winged bat-faced bats and the bones beneath the water. This time, he intended to investigate what those bones guarded.

They walked across the water, hearing a baby-like cry. At their current strength, they no longer feared it.

“Waa…” Suddenly, dark figures rushed toward Luo Tian and Yao Chen.

“Shixi!” Luo Tian extended a hand, ten-colored flames enveloping them. The intense heat made the cave walls warm.

Luo Tian paid no heed; the bat-faced bats, like moths drawn to a flame, collided with the ten-colored flames and turned to ash.

“Check underwater?” Luo Tian urged Yao Chen, who naturally agreed. Luo Tian extinguished the flames and dove into the water, descending to the riverbed covered in bones.

Soon after, a mass of bones gathered and rushed toward Luo Tian and Yao Chen. Yao Chen looked at Luo Tian: “I’m not accustomed to the water, you do it!”

“Alright!” Luo Tian nodded. He swung his crackling spear, slicing through the water and scattering bones across the riverbed.

Spear sweeping in waves… Luo Tian cut down the bones like wheat, their presence no longer hindering their pace. They marched forward.

Luo Tian didn’t know how long he had swung, but golden light emerged in his and Yao Chen’s vision. The light pierced through the bones, radiating a pressure that made both men look intrigued.

Yao Chen retrieved his staff and smashed the golden light. The bones shattered, sending fragments flying, but not all the golden bones were destroyed.

“Whose bones are these?” Yao Chen was stunned. Though his strength was weakened in the water, it was enough to shatter a mid-Immortal King’s bones.

“I won’t believe it!” Yao Chen growled, gathering his strength and striking the bones. *Boom…*

A dull sound echoed; this time, a large number of golden bones shattered, the light intensifying and pressure rising.

Luo Tian shielded Yao Chen from the bones while observing, wary of any surprises—this was Eternal Mountain.

Yao Chen kept striking, the bones flying apart. Finally, after his efforts, all the bones blocking the golden light were cleared. A towering beam of golden light rose, its overwhelming pressure making Luo Tian and Yao Chen’s faces grim.

“What is it?” Luo Tian thrust his spear, piercing an Immortal King bone and addressing Yao Chen.

“A single bone…” Yao Chen’s eyes glowed golden, exclaiming in surprise.

“It might be a Sovereign’s remains!” Yao Chen felt the immense pressure, making Luo Tian’s heart skip a beat. He knew anything related to a Sovereign was no simple matter.

“But these bones seem locked by something!” Yao Chen continued observing without attacking.

“What is it? A key?” Upon careful inspection, Yao Chen gasped. On a complete set of bones, a golden key hung from the fingers. If not closely observed, it would be missed. Though small, it radiated an ancient aura.

“A key—what does it open?” Luo Tian questioned, continuously defending against the bones.

“I’ll take the key first. Though these bones have pressure, perhaps it’s due to time and not very strong.”

“Be careful—life comes first!” Luo Tian and Yao Chen exchanged rapid words, deciding to take something before feeling regretful.

As they spoke, Yao Chen leapt into the golden light. Luo Tian defended against the bones while wondering about Yao Chen’s situation.

*Roar…*

But Yao Chen hadn’t been in the light long before a series of roars echoed from within. A thunderous sound spread, making Luo Tian frown.

Luo Tian felt concern but the bones were a problem.

How many bones had he shattered? A streak of light finally emerged, and Yao Chen spat blood, addressing Luo Tian: “Flee!”

Chapter 2699: Ancient Key

Luo Tian was momentarily stunned, but a torrential aura erupted from Yao Chen’s feet. Instantly understanding, he didn’t hesitate and rushed with Yao Chen into the depths.

*Crack…*

As soon as Luo Tian and Yao Chen took flight, a streak of light rose from the golden glow—indeed, the golden skeleton. Two balls of golden fire danced in its eye sockets, gazing at Luo Tian and Yao Chen’s direction. It stepped through the void, chasing them.

The aura spread, making Luo Tian and Yao Chen’s minds tremble. They fled toward the barrier.

“You’re bold!” Luo Tian thought, and in an instant, he burst through several ten thousand zhangs.

*Boom…*

The golden skeleton chased for several ten thousand zhangs before stopping. A golden chain was tied to its foot bones, locking the skeleton in place.

“Once I shatter this cursed thing, the ancient secret will be yours!” The golden skeleton roared, its voice cold.

“Who is this?” Luo Tian and Yao Chen felt the skeleton stop. They sighed in relief.

“The ancient secret!” Yao Chen exclaimed, gazing at the golden skeleton. At the same time, they reached the barrier that had previously hindered Luo Tian. Luo Tian briefly concealed Yao Chen and rushed into the barrier.

Upon entering, he released Yao Chen. A black bridge appeared in their vision.

Luo Tian knew there was no danger here, as the wind beast had been eliminated. He asked: “What is this ancient secret?”

“I stayed in Xumishan for a while, studying some sutras and learned some secrets.”

“The ancient secret contains many opportunities. Even in the primordial era, it was renowned. However, after the primordial collapse, the ancient secret vanished. According to the Buddha of Xumishan’s guess, it holds the reason for the primordial collapse,” Yao Chen replied. He extended his hand and a golden key appeared in it.

“This key is the one to open the ancient secret. There are three keys in total, and since the primordial collapse, they have remained hidden,” Yao Chen continued, making Luo Tian’s heart stir.

“If we truly find the location of the ancient secret, then we’ve made a huge gain!” Luo Tian said. He knew this key’s appearance would stir up a storm across the Immortal realm, including Hell.

“Let’s keep it. Perhaps the ancient secret is more dangerous than Eternal Mountain,” Yao Chen handed the key to Luo Tian, saying it was safer with him.

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate and took the key. After carefully examining it, finding no peculiarities, he stored it.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian and Yao Chen didn’t waste time. Walking along the black bridge, they smoothly reached its end.

“It’s a bit cold,” Yao Chen frowned, sensing some chill from the bridge’s end. *Huff…*

They reached the bridge’s exit and found snow pouring in, cold air making Luo Tian frown.

“What happened?” Luo Tian was puzzled. He clearly remembered that after exiting this bridge, it would be the inheritance place of the Fallen Immortal King. Then came the Serpent Valley, which was Luo Tian’s destination. If time allowed, he also wanted to visit the Ancient Heaven Court.

But clearly, exiting here wasn’t the Fallen Immortal King’s inheritance but a different place.

“Never mind. We must exit!” Luo Tian stepped forward with Yao Chen, exiting the passage.

At their emergence, a cold aura instantly invaded them. Snowflakes as large as geese fell from the sky.

Visually, a white expanse stretched out. Ice mountains rose from the ground, snow covering the earth, making Luo Tian and Yao Chen momentarily stunned.

“Where is this?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a bitter smile. He was confused, as it differed from his plan.

“Indeed, Eternal Mountain. Such harsh conditions make the Immortal realm unable to survive!” He sighed.

This icy and snowy terrain made even Luo Tian feel cold. The chill seeped into his bones; if an Immortal came, they would be frozen within a quarter of an hour.

*Crunch…*

Luo Tian and Yao Chen stepped onto the snow, which reached halfway up their legs. It was clearly long-standing snow.

They took their second step, using their cultivation to walk on the blood surface. They marched toward the icy and snowy depths.

Luo Tian and Yao Chen grew tense, as Luo Tian was unfamiliar with this place. He dared not be careless.

Snow and wind howled, the snowfall increasing. A blizzard formed, leaving no path. They could only move in one direction, attempting to find a way out.

“Such an environment has no living creatures!” Luo Tian frowned. They pressed on through the growing snow and wind.

Time passed, the snowfall intensified. Even Luo Tian and Yao Chen felt cold, with the chill eroding their bodies, slowing their pace.

Ten-colored flames erupted from Luo Tian’s body, enveloping both of them and expelling the cold.

“This is too cold!” Yao Chen’s face showed shock. They had reached the late Immortal King stage, nearly impervious to all methods. Yet here, their bodies were invaded by cold.

*Roar…*

But just as the ten-colored flames rose, a roar echoed through the world. Wind and snow converged, forming countless massive figures—each composed of ice.

Various beasts made of ice appeared in Luo Tian and Yao Chen’s vision, making them momentarily stunned.

“Who!” Luo Tian and Yao Chen shouted. The beasts each radiated formidable power, with several ice kings among them.

“Roar…” The response was a thunderous roar. A thousand-zhang-high snow bear charged toward Luo Tian and Yao Chen, slamming its white paw.

The massive paw obscured the sky, radiating overwhelming divine might. It descended with ferocity.

“I’ll handle it!” Yao Chen sneered, swinging his golden staff. A thick staff shadow swept across the area. *Boom…*

The bear’s paw was shattered by Yao Chen’s staff, and a large number of ice beasts were also destroyed.

Luo Tian joined in as the entire world was filled with ice beasts, and an ice giant radiated immense pressure, approaching them.

Chapter 2700: Entering the Serpent Clan

In the icy snowfield, Luo Tian and Yao Chen continuously fought. Each ice beast was shattered, turning into drifting snow across the horizon.

“These ice beasts clearly weren’t formed naturally. Someone must have凝聚 them. Who could possess such power, comparable to the Yellow Spring Army!” Luo Tian observed the approaching giant, his mind in awe.

The ice giant radiated immense power—Immortal King’s peak. This made Luo Tian more cautious. If the Yellow Spring Army were here, he wouldn’t be concerned about this Immortal King’s peak ice giant.

Luo Tian could sense this ice giant was comparable to his two Immortal King’s peak Yellow Spring Army. However, the Yellow Spring Army couldn’t be used now, so he had to take it seriously.

“This big fellow is mine. The rest are yours. After finishing, leave quickly. I have a bad feeling,” Luo Tian urged Yao Chen and rushed toward the ice giant.

Luo Tian wasn’t afraid of this ice giant, but he feared whoever controlled these ice beasts. If they appeared, it would be very troublesome.

Manifesting the World! In an instant, Luo Tian, amidst the fierce snow and wind, transformed into a thousand-zhang figure before the ice giant. He punched.

*Roar…*

The ice giant roared, lacking any intelligence. It raised a hand and punched back.

Two massive figures retreated. Luo Tian’s eyes grew more serious, charging toward the ice giant again. The ice giant showed no hesitation, roaring and spitting out a terrifying storm that swept toward Luo Tian.

Numerous spear shadows danced as Luo Tian wielded his crackling spear, clashing with the storm.

*Boom…*

Destructive waves swept across. Snow and ice filled the air as Luo Tian and the ice giant reached each other, their fists colliding repeatedly.

Yao Chen frowned. Each ice beast was shattered by his attacks, but they were endless. Though they seemed safe, if time passed long, it would be detrimental for them since no one knew what awaited next.

The thunderous sound continued. After a while, Yao Chen felt his arms tired from the relentless attacks of the ice beasts.

“Not good,” Luo Tian repelled the ice giant, large snow chunks falling from its body.

“Let’s run. This harsh environment will eventually wear us down unless we find the one controlling these ice beasts and kill them.”

But where to look? They had no chance now, and who knew what kind of existence the opponent was.

“Run…” Luo Tian unleashed a flurry of punches, repelling the ice giant thousands of zhangs. They took flight toward the distance.

The Infernal Flame Array!

Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, a surge of fire engulfing the world. A line of ten-colored fire dragons rose and rushed toward them, turning the ice beasts into snow water.

Luo Tian and Yao Chen didn’t hesitate. They rushed out, while behind them, the ice giant led countless beasts chasing after them.

The snowfield instantly erupted in chaos. The scene was terrifying, as if a blizzard had followed them.

Time flowed slowly. Luo Tian and Yao Chen finally felt a touch of warmth, their faces showing joy. Meanwhile, the ice beasts no longer chased them.

*Boom…*

On the muddy path, Luo Tian and Yao Chen landed on the ground. They gazed toward the snowfield.

Luo Tian surveyed his surroundings, his eyes showing joy as he recognized the surrounding forest. This was once the Serpent Clan’s territory.

As the ground no longer had snow, Luo Tian noticed many snake corpses on the border between the snowfield and land. They were clearly frozen to death.

“Did something happen to the Serpent Clan?” Luo Tian felt a chill.

“Let’s go…” He was anxious, fearing something had changed with the Serpent Clan. After all, this was his lifeline; his purpose here was to summon the Serpent Emperor.

Luo Tian led Yao Chen into the forest. He had stayed in the Serpent Clan before, so he was quite familiar with this forest.

Quickly, Luo Tian led Yao Chen to the Serpent Clan’s territory. Before reaching their destination, a line of colorful large snakes appeared on the ground, their cold eyes watching Luo Tian and Yao Chen. Their tongues flicked continuously.

Though these snakes were no threat to Luo Tian and Yao Chen, they still felt uncomfortable.

“Huang Shan!” Luo Tian’s face lit with a smile. He gazed at a figure peeking out, a girl in yellow clothes appearing. Her eyes looked at Luo Tian.

“Luo大哥!” Seeing Luo Tian, the yellow-clad girl showed disbelief. She had received news of a human entering the Serpent Valley. Curious, she came to check and was surprised to find Luo Tian.

Time had left no trace on Huang Shan. Her mindset and personality remained unchanged. Years ago, she first saw Luo Tian, wanting to sacrifice him for the Serpent Emperor. She was a fiery little pepper, unlike her appearance.

“How are you here?” Huang Shan asked. At the same time, several figures appeared behind her—two elders of the Serpent Clan who protected Huang Shan.

“I’m here to find the Serpent Emperor. How is she?” Luo Tian walked alongside them, calculating time. The Serpent Emperor should have awakened.

“Luo Tian?” They quickly reached the Serpent Clan’s territory. The Serpent Clan led Luo Tian and Yao Chen to their gathering place.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian frowned. He noticed the Serpent Emperor’s statue had vanished, clearly awakened.

“The Serpent Emperor has disappeared…” Luo Tian said upon arrival. Huang Shan’s face was worried, addressing Luo Tian.

Years ago, a massive stone fell from the sky, radiating icy coldness. It instantly froze an area of thirty million li and changed the weather, causing eternal snowfall.

“Empress Lady was very solemn in checking it. Then a massive battle erupted. Empress Lady and a firebird fought against that entity for one day and night, finally entering the depths of Eternal Mountain.”

“Back then, that entity arrived. Not only did Empress Lady go, but many powerful beings also appeared. That day, the sky and earth collapsed, like the end of the world. We only know they entered the depths of Eternal Mountain and don’t know what happened after…” An elder spoke, his voice filled with fear, as if recalling the terrifying battle.

Chapter 2700: Breaking the Seal

Luo Tian and Yao Chen were stunned by the Serpent Clan elders’ account. Their hearts were shocked; Luo Tian hadn’t expected such a major event to occur after he left.

“That battle was truly terrifying. We couldn’t even imagine it!”

“After that battle, Empress Lady never returned. She left a message saying not to seek deeper and then disappeared!” The Serpent Clan elders spoke.

“Ah, I see,” Luo Tian sighed. His gaze turned toward the depths of the Serpent Valley, his eyes filled with bitterness.

“Let’s find her!” Immediately after, Luo Tian made a decision. The Serpent Emperor was their lifeline of the Tianyuan Sect. If they could bring her out, then the Hell problem would be resolved, subduing everything. If not, the Tianyuan Sect would be in danger.

“Don’t look for her! It’s too dangerous!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Serpent Clan people loudly advised against it. After all, Luo Tian had done them a favor before. Though they were worried about the Serpent Emperor’s danger, they didn’t want Luo Tian to take the risk.

“No matter what, I must go in and see!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He also had a concern about the Heavenly Court.

Seeing Luo Tian was determined, the Serpent Clan leader sighed and didn’t stop him.

“This you should keep,” the Serpent Clan leader led Luo Tian to their treasure vault. He carefully took a jade box and handed it to Luo Tian.

“What is this?” Luo Tian opened the jade box, a cold aura instantly rising in his palm.

A green scale radiated waves. Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly; he felt some pressure on this scale.

“This is the Serpent Emperor’s scale!”

“Hopefully, it will help you,” the Serpent Clan leader spoke softly, his eyes filled with reverence.

“Senior, do you have any ideas on leaving this Serpent Valley?” Luo Tian didn’t refuse but asked the leader, hoping to include the Serpent Valley in the Tianyuan Sect.

“Never mind. The Empress Lady’s fate is unknown, and we’ve never thought of leaving the Serpent Valley. The outside world is more complex than here!” The leader shook his head gently. He knew the outside world was treacherous, and if the Serpent Clan went out, it would be very dangerous.

“Apologies,” Luo Tian bowed slightly. He thought himself reckless for thinking the Serpent Clan should go out, especially now with the Immortal realm so chaotic. The Tianyuan Sect was struggling to survive and couldn’t afford to drag the Serpent Clan into it.

Luo Tian and Yao Chen rested for a night. The next day, they exited the Serpent Valley.

Red earth appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. His face darkened, as the entire world was chaotic.

“What happened…” Luo Tian’s breath quickened. His heart pounded, as he had encountered Longque here before. This was also where Longque sealed his enemy.

Luo Tian and Yao Chen continued walking, with thunderous sounds echoing. Their faces showed tension.

A scorching aura swept the world. In their vision, red flames spread, burning everything. Even the sky seemed ignited. Below the sky, the earth collapsed, and icy coldness surged upward. Two waves of power continuously clashed.

“The seal is broken!” Luo Tian exclaimed, watching the collapsed earth. He clearly remembered that Longque had sealed this land with Xiaqi’s fire and Ye Huo’s fire.

“What happened?” Luo Tian murmured. The broken seal had a battle aura, but this land had no one.

“Master…” A weak voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. He was momentarily stunned.

The Heaven-Refining Stone!

Luo Tian moved swiftly, landing at the edge of the broken seal. He picked up a small stone.

“What’s going on? Why are you here!” Luo Tian panicked. He had once caused a commotion at the Eternal Mountain, and Longque had taken the Heaven-Refining Stone and Zhang Daotian’s soul. He didn’t know where Longque had taken them, but he was certain that with Longque and the Heaven-Refining Stone, Zhang Daotian must be safe.

But now, seeing the Heaven-Refining Stone’s appearance, it lacked its former divine laws. It was clearly weak, and something must have happened. It likely had to do with the battle the Serpent Clan elders spoke of.

“Don’t worry. Your master and that sparrow are safe!” The Heaven-Refining Stone replied, knowing what Luo Tian was most worried about.

“We entered Eternal Mountain and lived there. We helped your master reshape his body, and he also participated in the Heavenly Court’s trials. His strength increased rapidly!”

“But later, a bug came. It was with Longque’s enemy. Its condition was much better than ours. We naturally fought, and that fellow tore apart Longque’s seal with heavy injuries!”

“The Serpent Clan girl also came out. A senior from the forest deeps also emerged and fought in chaos. I was severely injured and fell here. They don’t know where they went. Those two likely aimed for the Heavenly Court!”

“But that sparrow finally destroyed the seal to enter the Heavenly Court trials, sending your master in!” The Heaven-Refining Stone continuously communicated with Luo Tian.

“Where are they?” Luo Tian listened to the Heaven-Refining Stone’s words, which were similar to what the Serpent Clan leader said but more detailed.

“Don’t know where they went. Don’t worry, their cultivation is so high now; dying isn’t easy. That sparrow and his enemy fought for so long, yet they didn’t die!” The Heaven-Refining Stone replied.

“Who is Longque’s enemy?” Luo Tian was puzzled. Though he knew these people were powerful, Longque, the Heaven-Refining Stone, and the Serpent Emperor were all strong. Even now, he had to look up to them.

“A bug, one that was in opposition with the sparrow. They were natural enemies!” The Heaven-Refining Stone replied.

“Master, do you have any medicine? I need to replenish…”

“Wait… You have a ghost pulse!” The Heaven-Refining Stone’s voice was filled with excitement. It was about to act, but Luo Tian grabbed it.

“Don’t be so reckless. I rely on this to survive!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched. He wasn’t stingy, but he feared the Heaven-Refining Stone would drain his entire ghost pulse. The Heaven-Refining Stone’s strength was something he had experienced firsthand.

“Can it go out or not?” Luo Tian murmured softly, gazing at the place where he had entered the Heavenly Court trials. It was completely destroyed.

“Let’s go out, master. Don’t worry. Though that sparrow isn’t here, I, the Heaven-Refining Stone, am not what I was. These years, my strength has grown significantly!” The Heaven-Refining Stone looked at Luo Tian’s disappointment and spoke loudly, its voice filled with arrogance.

Chapter 2701: Return

Tianlan Mountain, now known as Tianyuan Mountain. However, the current Tianyuan Sect was extremely tense. The sect had received news that Hell’s army had attacked the First Heaven, found no Immortal realm beings there, and then returned to Hell.

With the First Heaven being captured, it declared that the entire Middle Three Heavens had become Hell’s territory. The Yama Ten Palaces, several major Heaven Kings, were at their peak, having gained many benefits. The most direct was resources.

In the Tianyuan Sect’s council hall, people wore solemn expressions as they discussed how to respond.

“One month. Hell’s army will attack the Tianyuan Sect in one month. Scouts reported that Hell had spent great effort to redeem their Holy Son and Immortal King late-stage strength.”

“The Luo Shengmen vanished without a trace, as if evaporated. Even the Ten Palaces’ lords couldn’t find it. This matter was left unresolved, so Yama’s other palaces turned their anger toward the Tianyuan Sect.”

“Luo Shengmen is gone. I hope he doesn’t return!” The hall fell silent.

This catastrophe was a major one for the Tianyuan Sect. If they could withstand it, they would be able to establish themselves from now on. If not, they would be annihilated.

“Additionally, during this time, some sect disciples have fled. Two million disciples have left. Now we only have less than eight million!” Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, his eyes cold.

“Don’t care. The remaining majority are from the Star Domain. Our Tianyuan Sect has endured many storms before. This one is just a bigger storm,” Xiang Tianming spoke, his eyes filled with laughter.

Strength. Indeed, the current Tianyuan Sect was strong. Its overall strength was no match for any palace, but it lacked an Immortal King peak.

“The Ten Palaces’ alliance. I want to see who dares to take the lead!” Jiang Sxi’s eyes showed coldness. The hall people also had murderous intent in their eyes.

“Prepare for war. Recall the forces guarding Heaven-Refining City,” Jiang Sxi began issuing orders, and the Tianyuan Sect started to act. They recalled disciples on training missions.

Tension. As the Tianyuan Sect prepared for war, surrounding forces also became tense, fleeing in fear of being caught up in the chaos.

“Really going to fight? The Tianyuan Sect is too bold!”

“Fighting with an egg. If it were still the nine Immortal Mountains ruling, the Tianyuan Sect would definitely be the Middle Three Heavens’ master. But now it’s Hell ruling, and they’ve offended Yama’s Ten Palaces. How could they let them go!”

“Deserved. They once defected from the Immortal realm to join Hell, then defected again. Two-faced traitors wanting independence. Who gave them the courage!” The people of the Middle Three Heavens discussed, many strongly opposing the Tianyuan Sect.

Years ago, Luo Tian’s death caused the Tianyuan Sect to massacre the Middle Three Heavens, weakening their strength. Later, they defected from the Middle Three Heavens to let Hell’s army in. If not for that, the Middle Three Heavens would never have fallen so easily.

Now, people still in the Middle Three Heavens were uncomfortable with their new life. They had adapted to the environment, but it was still awkward.

At this moment, Luo Tian and Yao Chen appeared at the edge of ancient forests—Eternal Mountain’s outskirts.

“What to do?” Yao Chen asked. They hadn’t continued searching for the Serpent Emperor, as the Heaven-Refining Stone said it was impossible to find. Even if they searched for a year and half, it might be impossible. And the danger was immense. If time allowed, Luo Tian could gamble and enter deeper into Eternal Mountain. But now he couldn’t afford it; he needed to return to the Tianyuan Sect.

“Back. The only good news is that the Tianyuan Sect’s position now can’t be entered by Immortal King peaks!” Luo Tian replied. He stood on the red earth, and Yao Chen led him toward Jiutian City.

Luo Tian was very worried. He knew that Immortal King peaks had methods to enter the Middle Three Heavens.

“How about it, master? I’m impressive. I can even suppress the two characters ‘Ghost Valley’!” The Heaven-Refining Stone boasted to Luo Tian.

“Rubbish. That’s three-tenths of my ghost pulse!” The Heaven-Refining Stone didn’t speak for long. When it did, Luo Tian immediately cursed. Thinking about the Heaven-Refining Stone’s terrifying consumption, he felt心疼. If not for his intervention, this fellow might have absorbed the entire ghost pulse.

Without the ‘Ghost Valley’ two characters, Luo Tian and Yao Chen did avoid many troubles. Yao Chen went alone to Jiutian City while Luo Tian didn’t know how to enter the Middle Three Heavens.

Yao Chen flew for three days and reached Jiutian City. Though the Middle Three Heavens had fallen, Jiutian City was still lively and even more so than when Luo Tian first entered.

Yao Chen’s arrival drew some attention, as his appearance was peculiar.

“Where did this monkey come from? Whose pet ran out?” Someone pointed and gossiped, their eyes filled with greed.
