“Can… can…” Luo Tian’s face displayed paternal affection, nodding repeatedly as Luo Li clung to him with eager fingers.

“Luo Tian, enough! We should return to Tianyuan first. Though the news from home says the Thunder Domain has retreated, it’s still wise to prepare early!” Nan Gong Yuqing remained calm, addressing Luo Tian.

“Hmph.” Luo Tian nodded, exhaling a quiet sigh in his heart, his eyes flashing with killing intent as he gazed into the void.

“Ah! Father, two days ago some villains tried to kill us! It was so scary—many uncles and elders died at their hands! You must avenge us!” Luo Li’s childish voice echoed beneath the starry sky, as Luo Tian and his companions vanished from the spot, flying toward the direction of the Tianyuan Continent.

“Hmph. Revenge!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed beneath the stars.

Chapter 1029: The Homeland of Tianyuan ()

Since Luo Tian had lifted the seal on the Tianyuan Continent, its people had blossomed like spring bamboo, their talents rising rapidly. Perhaps the suppression was too harsh; once freed, their cultivation surged without bounds.

Zhang Ziping and others of the younger generation advanced swiftly, reaching the initial stage of Sainthood or nearly there. Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, Jiang Sixi, and others had also entered the initial stage of Sainthood. Meanwhile, elder warriors like Luo Xiong and Luo Nan Tian had ascended to the middle stage of Sainthood.

Though the Four Sacred Star Domains’ overall strength still lagged behind the major domains, it rivaled Fire Domain. The sole weakness was the absence of Sainthood Peak and Sainthood Apex masters to anchor their might.

After all, Tianyuan was still weak; the time had been too short compared to other domains.

At that moment, in the Hall of the Five Elements, Luo Xiong and Wei Mingxuan sat among familiar figures, their atmosphere heavy with tension.

“Everyone, what should we do? The Thunder Domain’s attack has cost us dearly. It was only thanks to the great array of Wanyun Kong that we held out. And even then, the Thunder Domain’s Sainthood Apex master didn’t intervene. If this continues, our Four Sacred Star Domains will truly be in danger!” Luo Xiong spoke, his voice laced with gravity.

“What can we do? Tianyuan is our foundation; we cannot abandon it. Besides, leaving would take too long—what if the Thunder Domain’s forces arrive before we even depart?” Wei Mingxuan sighed softly.

The faces of the sect leaders in the hall bore a bitter expression. Indeed, it was strength that determined their fate. If the Four Sacred Star Domains had a Sainthood Apex and several Sainthood Peak masters, they would not be so passive.

“Everyone, I’ve returned!” As the hall’s atmosphere grew tense, a surge of energy rippled through the air. Luo Tian and his companions appeared in sight, with the children also materializing.

Luo Li was cradled in Luo Tian’s arms, sleeping soundly with a faint smile on his face.

“Luo Tian!” Seeing him, the crowd’s faces lit up with exhilaration. The hall erupted in chaos as they surrounded Luo Tian and his group, speaking excitedly.

Luo Tian gazed at the familiar faces around him, warmth swelling in his chest. He nodded to them with a smile but hesitated to let go of Luo Li.

“You son, you still know how to return!” Luo Xiong swung his hand and smacked Luo Tian’s head, snorting.

“You really are something, sneaking off like that and leaving three wives behind!” Luo Nan Tian attempted to scold but was stopped by Zhang Qiuyue’s hand on his waist.

Luo Tian shrank back, a hint of apology in his eyes as he respectfully said, “But I haven’t come too late! With me here, the Four Sacred Star Domains will not suffer!”

Luo Tian’s bold voice rang out, laced with confidence. His gaze swept over the familiar faces—some had been his life-and-death brothers, others had once been enemies. But after the events at Wangyue Sect, they were now united under Tianyuan.

“Hmph! Still talking big!” Shangguan Hongtu, now the master of the Yeluo Sect, spoke sarcastically. He still harbored resentment toward Luo Tian.

“Shangguan, after so many years, why are you still like this? What would it take for you to believe me?” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, dismissing Shangguan’s words. Though they had once been rivals, years of trials had made it clear: their relationship was now friend rather than foe.

“Luo Tian, the enemy is a Sainthood Apex master! How can you be so certain?” Others chimed in, their voices laced with inquiry. Naturally, they felt Luo Tian’s cultivation had reached the initial stage of Sainthood.

“You could kill a Sainthood Late-stage master with your pseudo-epoch treasure, but a Sainthood Apex is terrifying—far beyond the reach of a Sainthood Late-stage!” Murmurs of concern rippled through the crowd.

“Rest easy, all is under my control. I’ll ensure the Thunder Domain’s forces never return!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold determination.

“My father is the strongest!” Luo Xitíng lifted her face, admiration glowing in her eyes as she gazed at the crowd.

“Haha, Xiting’s right!” Luo Xiong clearly doted on his grandchild. His face shifted from gloom to joy as he scooped up Luo Xitíng.

“Enough, everyone—disperse! Watch the show as you wish. This time, I’ll not only ensure the Thunder Domain’s forces perish here but also lead us to invade their domain, making it an annex of our Four Sacred Star Domains!” Luo Tian addressed the crowd.

“Good, Luo Tian—trust in you!” The crowd spoke in unison, though some doubted. Yet Luo Tian had never failed them before. His name was now legendary across the nine domains, leaving no choice but to place their hopes in him.

“Son, it’s on you!” Luo Xiong, Luo Nan Tian, and Zhang Qiuyue also prepared to leave, not wishing to intrude on Luo Tian’s reunion with Gu Qianxue. Zhang Qiuyue took Luo Li from Luo Tian’s arms and stepped out of the hall.

“Zheng Xin, what are you staring at?” Dan Yuyan grabbed Zheng Xin’s ear and dragged him out, the hall echoing with Zheng Xin’s wails.

“Luo Tian, we’ll take our leave too!” Nan Gong Yuqing naturally didn’t wish to intrude. A smile graced his face as he and Wanyun Kong, Li Tianzhi, and their former Star River Four Thieves exited the hall.

Figures vanished one by one until the hall was empty, leaving only Luo Tian and the three women. The trio finally dropped their disguises, eyes glistening with tears as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with deep affection, his face etched with profound regret. He had been away for so long—especially for Qianxue, who had given birth while he was absent. He felt a deep sense of guilt toward the three women.

“Did you find Yunting?” Gu Qianxue asked first, her voice laced with inquiry and concern.

Luo Tian’s heart warmed; while he had sought other women, the three women’s first question was whether he had found Yunting. This sentiment would forever elude repayment.

Luo Tian nodded, unable to contain himself any longer. He swept the three into his arms, a tender expression on his face.

“Sorry!” The three words brought the women to tears. The four embraced in the hall, forgetting time’s passage until dusk fell.

“Hmph… speak up! Did you flirt with other women this time?” The three women, regaining their composure, instantly changed demeanor. One clutched Luo Tian’s ear while the other two gripped his waist.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian dared not resist, grimacing in pain as he cried out for mercy. After an hour of interrogation, the women relented, their tears turning to smiles.

“Hmph… wives, shouldn’t we rest now?” Luo Tian was eager, having abstained for years. The three women, radiant and alluring, were irresistible. He immediately reacted.

“Hmph! Dream on!” The three women snorted, but before they could finish speaking, Luo Tian had already vanished with them into their old room. His familiarity was undiminished; even after years, he still found the location.

“Roar…” Luo Tian let out a low growl, transforming into another face as he lunged at the three women.

“Ah… stop it! Qiuchan hasn’t given birth yet—let her go first… mm…” A melodious voice echoed through the spacious room.

Morning sunlight spilled into the chamber as Luo Tian awoke, smiling softly at the bustling three women. His face softened with tenderness.

“Father, you’re bad! You’ve been bullying three mothers!” Luo Li’s voice suddenly echoed through the room, startling Luo Tian and the three women who had already dressed.

“Boom…” A small figure plummeted from the void, landing atop Luo Tian’s chest. Even Luo Tian was unprepared for the sudden impact.

“Father, what did you do yesterday? The three mothers were shouting so much I couldn’t sleep!” Luo Li, his voice high-pitched and childish, lay on Luo Tian’s chest, eyes filled with confusion.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian blushed but quickly turned surprised. He had set a barrier outside, yet this child had slipped in.

The three women blushed furiously, glaring at Luo Tian. Fortunately, Luo Li was still young; if he had appeared then, they would have been mortified.

“Ah… Father was playing a game of riding horses with your three mothers!” Luo Tian smiled, explaining amidst the women’s murderous glares.

“This kid really needs to be watched!” Luo Tian mused, finally convincing Luo Li that it was indeed a game with the three mothers. The women then left contently.

“I want to ride too!” Before the three women could exit, Luo Li’s childish voice rang out, nearly causing them to fall.

They shot Luo Tian a glare with unspoken meaning: “If you let others know about this, I’ll deal with you!”

“Okay, okay, ride!” Luo Tian sighed, placing Luo Li on his back and stepping onto the ground. He began to let Luo Li ride him like a horse.

Time flowed slowly; Luo Tian spent the morning with Luo Li, feeling he had neglected his son greatly.

“Luo Tian, there’s news from the Thunder Domain! Come to the hall!” Zhang Ziping’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s jade token, startling him. He grabbed Luo Li and vanished from the room.

Chapter 1030: Deployment ()

The Hall of Five Elements on Tianyuan was filled with all the sect leaders from the Four Sacred Star Domains. Now, Tianyuan had become the core of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

The Thunder Domain’s invasion had thrown the Four Sacred Star Domains into chaos, with all sects converging toward Tianyuan. Thus, the current Tianyuan was bustling. Even so, the outer regions of Tianyuan were overcrowded—this place had become the Four Sacred Star Domains’ last line of defense. If these people were destroyed, the Four Sacred Star Domains would be utterly annihilated, and even commoners might become slaves.

Luo Tian walked the path of the Five Elements Sect with a serene expression, cradling his son Luo Li. At this moment, Luo Li seemed to recognize no one, clinging tightly to Luo Tian as if fearing his sudden departure.

Along the way, he greeted disciples from the Five Elements Sect and other sects warmly. As Luo Tian neared the hall, a figure as flirtatious as himself appeared before him.

“Luo Tian?”

“Zheng Xin?” They both spoke at once, exchanging knowing smiles before striding into the hall.

Luo Tian entered the hall slowly, a smile on his face as he gazed at the crowd’s somber expressions. He shook his head lightly.

“Luo Tian!” A chorus of figures stood up, recalling Luo Tian’s bold promises the day before. Their gazes were all fixed on him.

“Those two sons must have taken the wrong medicine; I feel they’re sick! Their gait is strange!” Li Tianzhi furrowed his brow, confusion etched on his face.

“Haha, brother, it’s new love—do you understand? You guys single dogs just don’t get it, hahaha!” Zheng Xin laughed heartily, approaching Nan Gong Yuqing and the younger generation. His eyes gleamed with triumph.

“Hmph…” The others snorted in unison, glaring at Zheng Xin’s smug face as they longed to slap him.

“Everyone, there’s news from the Thunder Domain!” As Nan Gong Yuqing and Lei Yong prepared to beat Zheng Xin, Luo Tian’s voice echoed through the hall, instantly shifting their expressions to solemnity.

Others fell silent, turning their gazes toward Sha Cangmang of the Qinglong Sect. He was the one who had brought the news, making him the most suitable speaker.

“Indeed, our Qinglong Sect’s disciple discovered traces of the Thunder Domain’s forces while traveling to the Four Sacred Star Domains. The Thunder Domain seems to have found something, rushing toward Duan Shen Cliff. They’ve stopped causing chaos in the Four Sacred Star Domains now. Their retreat from Tianyuan must be related!” Sha Cangmang’s face bore a grave expression as he spoke.

“Duan Shen Cliff!” The Four Sacred Star Domains’ people inhaled sharply. Though their strength was weak, they knew of the Nine Terrifying Places. They hadn’t expected the Thunder Domain to dare enter Duan Shen Cliff.

Luo Tian’s heart stirred slightly; he knew of Duan Shen Cliff’s terror but didn’t grasp its depth. After all, he had never reached the cliff’s peak. The terrifying presence in the middle of Duan Shen Cliff had always deterred him.

“Medicine King! Their goal must be that Medicine King!” Zheng Xin and the others, emerging from Duan Shen Cliff, had their faces tense.

“If the Thunder Domain secures that Medicine King, it would be a major problem. A single Medicine King could sustain an entire sect or clan. Like Meng Lingxiao’s Tiancan Xuanyu Coffin, it not only nourished half of Meng Lingxiao’s body but also countless rare medicinal herbs.

Rare medicinal herbs—each one a madness-inducing treasure. Luo Tian wouldn’t have been able to kill beyond his rank without such support, nor would he have been able to endlessly draw the Heaven-Defying Bow, using his initial Sainthood stage to kill a late-stage Saint. This audacious act.

If the news of the Medicine King in Duan Shen Cliff spread, others would also come—its strength wouldn’t be inferior to that of the ancient heavenly palace.

After all, the ancient heavenly palace was elusive, but Duan Shen Cliff had always remained here in the Four Sacred Star Domains. One could imagine how frenzied the sects of other domains would become.

“The Thunder Domain clearly discovered something and wants to seize it first. The news hasn’t spread yet!” People murmured, their brows furrowed tightly.

“What should we do? The Thunder Domain clearly came prepared. Duan Shen Cliff is one of the Nine Terrifying Places, but if they truly obtain something, we’ll be even more in danger!” Sha Cangmang’s aged face bore a solemn expression, his gaze turning to Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian had become their anchor, for he had once visited the Fire Domain and the Beast Domain.

“Duan Shen Cliff isn’t that easy to enter!” Luo Tian’s face bore a cold smile. A single Sainthood Apex and a group of Sainthood-level elders attempting to enter Duan Shen Cliff was like dreaming.

“Still, we can’t ignore it. We must prepare accordingly!” Luo Tian turned his gaze to Wan Yunkong.

“Don’t worry, my friend and Jiang Nanxuan didn’t rest at all last night!” Wan Yunkong patted his chest, a confident expression on his face.

“Didn’t rest at all…” Zheng Xin’s face took on a strange expression, gazing at Wan Yunkong and Jiang Nanxuan. He clearly misinterpreted Wan Yunkong’s meaning.

“Damn… you bastard…” Wan Yunkong, seeing Zheng Xin’s strange gaze, turned furious. He understood immediately that Zheng Xin had misunderstood.

“Ugh…” Jiang Nanxuan, even with his calm demeanor, glanced at Zheng Xin with a reproachful look. This kid had become too bold to say anything.

“Yu Yan… Zheng Xin’s been out there for two years. Let me tell you about the incident with the fox clan’s young master in the Beast Domain…” Wan Yunkong clearly knew who could discipline Zheng Xin, addressing Dan Yu Yan.

“Zheng Xin…” Dan Yu Yan gritted her teeth, her fiery temper flaring up. She forgot they were still discussing matters and dragged Zheng Xin out of the hall, where his wails echoed.

The crowd shook their heads lightly; these two were indeed a pair of troublemakers. They then turned their gazes to Wan Yunkong.

“Hmph, everyone rest easy. My friend and Jiang Nanxuan have already set up arrays around the surrounding continents of Tianyuan. They’re联动 arrays—once activated, it would be apocalyptic! This time we’ll play big, ensuring that the Sainthood Apex remains here!” Wan Yunkong’s face bore a proud expression, clearly satisfied with the arrays he had set up the previous night.

“What?” People’s faces bore disbelief as they gazed at Wan Yunkong, then their eyes flashed with excitement.

If Wan Yunkong’s words were true, Tianyuan would be impregnable. However, Luo Tian and the others knew Wan Yunkong’s unreliability.

“Wan Xiong, can it withstand a Sainthood Apex? Why do I feel it could only hold off several late-stage Saints? If there are too many, the array would be breached in time,” Jiang Nanxuan asked, his face filled with confusion as he gazed at Wan Yunkong.

Wan Yunkong’s face faltered, then he shrugged slightly, acknowledging Jiang Nanxuan was correct.

“Damn…” The crowd raised their middle fingers at Wan Yunkong, sighing inwardly. At this moment, this old man was still so unreliable.

“Enough! I’ll handle the Sainthood Apex and late-stage Saints!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a hint of amusement. He held a golden token in his hand, his gaze filled with cold determination.

“Tian Gong Token!” Zheng Xin and Nan Gong Yuqing’s faces changed, gazing at Luo Tian with inquiry.

“Luo Tian, think of another way. The ancient heavenly palace mustn’t be exposed!” Nan Gong Yuqing and others knew that if the ancient heavenly palace’s presence was revealed in Luo Tian’s hands, the Four Sacred Star Domains would become a hotbed of conflict. Duan Shen Cliff and the ancient heavenly palace—both treasures that even Epoch Masters would covet. The sects’ resources would surely clash over it.

“Don’t worry, I’m not that foolish. I won’t expose the ancient heavenly palace’s existence. After all, there are still many who seek it. If we don’t trap them all, what’s the point?” Luo Tian smiled reassuringly, calming them.

“Alright, continue preparing. We already have enough mid-stage and initial-stage Saints. The only lacking are Sainthood Apex and late-stage masters—such high-level combat power, others are already overwhelming!” Luo Tian chuckled, vanishing from sight. Of course, he still held his son Luo Li in his arms.

“I’ll go check the Thunder Domain’s situation at Duan Shen Cliff. If convenient, I’ll give them a helping hand!” Luo Tian’s figure vanished, his voice echoing in the hall.

“Let’s go! We’ll get moving too. Maybe it will be a fierce battle!” Luo Xiong, Sha Cangmang, and Wei Mingxuan, among the elder warriors, also addressed the crowd. The hall buzzed with activity as commands were relayed.

Luo Tian fully unleashed his power, moving at breakneck speed. For some reason, Luo Li in his arms emitted radiant light, pouting: “Father, your speed is too slow!”

Luo Tian saw Luo Li’s face filled with disdain and his lips twitched. Being criticized by a child of two or three years old wounded him, but he couldn’t help it—his speed was already maximum.

“Father, let me help you! Flying like this is too slow!” Luo Li’s small hand slapped Luo Tian’s chest, and in an instant, he carried Luo Tian into the stars.

“Damn kid!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly but didn’t resist, allowing Luo Li to vanish into the stars.

Chapter 1031: Soul-Eating Mist ()

At the base of Duan Shen Cliff, a dark mass of people surrounded it completely. Figures moved swiftly,一道道 lightning surged through the crowd. An old man’s face bore a sense of admiration as he gazed at Duan Shen Cliff’s grass and trees, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Indeed, a land of immortality!” The old man radiated a formidable aura, his white beard and robe giving him the air of an ancient immortal. His Sainthood Apex energy radiated from his body.

This man was Li Chengen, one of the three Sainthood Apex masters of the Thunder Domain. The Thunder Domain’s strength had now become two Sainthood Apex masters, as one of them had been slain by Diao Yuanshan in the Beast Domain.

The Thunder Domain’s misfortune was greatest in the Beast Domain, losing one Sainthood Apex master, a sect leader, two sect heirs, and several elders. This loss had severely wounded the Thunder Domain. Most importantly, the death of a Sainthood Apex master was an irreplaceable loss for a sect or even a star domain.

“Grandfather, if we secure this Medicine King and gift it to the old relic, they’ll emerge to prolong an epoch. In this era where epochs are rare, would the Thunder Domain be able to dominate all sects?” A late-stage Saint elder spoke respectfully toward Li Chengen.

“Partly, but the most important thing is to cultivate rare medicinal herbs with the Medicine King. When you reach Sainthood Apex, it will sustain your life, giving you a chance to enter the Epoch Realm!” Li Chengen’s face bore a sense of admiration. A single powerful individual wasn’t enough; like Diao Yuanshan in the Beast Domain, even with immense power, the Beast Domain was still ruled by the Feng Clan. A clan or sect’s overall strength is what truly counts.

“Everyone, stay put. I’ll go up first; the two of you follow me. I’ll show this Four Sacred Star Domains’ terrifying place!” Li Chengen sneered, pointing at two late-stage Saint elders. They ascended Duan Shen Cliff.

The two late-stage Saints’ mouths twitched, cursing their bad luck. Though Duan Shen Cliff was within the Four Sacred Star Domains, they weren’t afraid of others. The only thing they feared was Duan Shen Cliff itself.

But Li Chengen’s orders were impossible to ignore; they knew what would happen if they disobeyed.

Three aged figures, under the Thunder Domain’s respectful gazes, ascended Duan Shen Cliff. Soon they appeared at the half-mountain level that Luo Tian and others had previously visited.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian, carried into the void by Luo Li, stared intently at the three elders without moving.

Luo Tian marveled at his son’s miraculous constitution. If he didn’t speak, even a Sainthood Apex master wouldn’t detect their presence—this was truly audacious.

“Haha, old fools, you’ll be in vain! The danger is yours to bear; the fruits of victory are ours!” Luo Tian’s heart sneered, signaling Luo Li to stay silent.

But he soon realized his gesture was unnecessary; Luo Li’s eyes glowed with a sly light, clearly accustomed to such sneaky deeds. He didn’t need Luo Tian’s instruction; he carefully hid in the void, following the three elders without haste.

“Hmm?” Li Chengen was about to proceed when his brows furrowed slightly. As a Sainthood Apex master, his perception was keen, and his sense of danger far surpassed ordinary people.

Yet he extended two green lightning bolts from his hands, sending them into the void where Luo Tian and Luo Li had just appeared.

“Crack…” The green lightning seemed ordinary but nearly overturned the entire void, its invisible waves repeatedly striking Luo Tian. Luo Li was immediately protected by Luo Tian’s arms and suffered no harm.

Luo Tian’s heart surged with shock; he hadn’t expected a Sainthood Apex master’s technique to be so powerful. Even a casual flick of his fingers had nearly overwhelmed him.

“What’s wrong?” The two late-stage Saint elders immediately tensed, gazing at the void. After all, Duan Shen Cliff was a terrifying place; they had to be cautious.

“Nothing. Let’s go!” The old man shook his head slightly, stepping forward toward the cliff’s peak. Yet his brows remained furrowed.

Luo Tian and Luo Li hid in the void, holding their breath until the three elders had moved far away. They then sighed deeply.

“Ah! It was so scary, I almost died! Father, let’s run away quickly. That old man is too terrifying!” Luo Li’s face bore fear.

“Hmph, Li’er, a man must be brave, right?” Luo Tian advised his son.

Luo Tian had no fear; if things got too dire, he could retreat to the ancient heavenly palace using the Tian Gong Token.

“Hmph…” Under Luo Tian’s guidance, Luo Li nodded his head and then led Luo Tian into the void again. This time, they followed the three elders more cautiously but at a greater distance.

Though Li Chengen felt someone was watching them, he couldn’t find where the watcher was. As time passed, the three elders had walked nearly a thousand feet, leaving four thousand feet to reach Duan Shen Cliff’s peak.

But as time passed, the three elders noticed that the cliff’s summit was shrouded in a mist. Even Li Chengen, with his cultivation, couldn’t see what lay within the fog.

“I feel a strange aura affecting us,” one late-stage Saint elder said, gazing at the surrounding grass and trees. They still looked the same, as if fake, with no signs of growth or decay.

“Land of immortality, Epoch energy!” Li Chengen’s brows furrowed slightly as he sensed the surrounding atmosphere. His face subtly changed.

“Be careful. This Medicine King might be unusual, even possessing its own consciousness! It could rival an Epoch Master. If so, we should only collect the divine treasures and herbs around it—don’t disturb the Medicine King itself.” Li Chengen’s eyes flashed with intensity. Though he was a Sainthood Apex master, Duan Shen Cliff would still make even Epoch Masters bleed.

“Roar…” As the three elders cautiously advanced, a deep roar echoed in their ears, causing Luo Tian and Luo Li to immediately become cautious. Luo Li instantly hid in Luo Tian’s arms, his small body trembling.

The people below the Thunder Domain also turned their gazes toward Duan Shen Cliff. In an instant, they widened their eyes in disbelief.

In view, Duan Shen Cliff’s towering cliff was instantly shrouded by thick fog, which spread outward. Within moments, it would rapidly engulf the Thunder Domain’s forces.

“Retreat…” A late-stage Saint elder of the Thunder Domain shouted, sensing the fog’s unusual nature.

But nearly a million people couldn’t simply retreat. Figures moved swiftly, and the fog’s spread seemed slow but instantly reached their bodies, swallowing some into its depths.

“Ah…” The grey fog carried strong corrosiveness, instantly taking the lives of countless warriors, making the fog denser.

“This…” Luo Tian stood in the void, covering Luo Li’s eyes with his hand, his face filled with shock.

At the same time, he inwardly shuddered; he was fortunate he hadn’t continued up the cliff. At that time, their group would have died miserably. After all, those from the Thunder Domain had at least Superhuman-level cultivation—his group was merely Supreme-level.

“Soul-Eating Mist! Even Sainthood masters can’t escape it! There’s a Soul-Eater in Duan Shen Cliff. Quick, retreat!” A late-stage Saint elder of the Thunder Domain roared, his body flashing as he escaped the fog.

“Damn it! Quick, vanish into the void! You can escape!” People cried out, waves of energy spreading. Sainthood and Superhuman-level masters rushed into the void, their faces filled with fear as they darted recklessly. Some rashly entered spatial rifts and were unknowingly transported elsewhere.

Luo Tian’s face bore shock; within a short time, Duan Shen Cliff was shrouded in fog. Within a hundred miles, there were no survivors.

“Ah! It’s the legendary Soul-Eating Mist!” Luo Tian’s face bore a hint of shock. He hadn’t expected to encounter such a thing.

Soul-Eating Mist devours souls; if touched, it would devour one’s soul without a chance of survival. Of course, this depends on the Soul-Eater’s level. If it reached Sainthood Apex, even Li Chengen would perish.

They had barely entered when nearly a million Thunder Domain warriors were instantly lost, and it was all for nothing. This made Li Chengen’s face grim.

“Beasts! Don’t let me catch you; I’ll skin and gut you!” Li Chengen and the two late-stage Saint elders’ bodies crackled with lightning, preventing the fog from invading. They continued slowly toward Duan Shen Cliff’s peak.

“Li’er, go home; I’ll go up and check it out. Be good!” Luo Tian gazed at the Soul-Eating Mist, knowing his opportunity had arrived. This mist not only devoured souls but also absorbed consciousness. As long as he was careful, Li Chengen wouldn’t detect him.

Chapter 1032: Blood of the Reincarnation Body ()

After much persuasion, Luo Li pouted and chose to leave. It wasn’t that Luo Tian didn’t want him to stay; after all, Luo Li’s ability to traverse the void could have helped greatly. But Luo Tian was still uneasy—too dangerous, fearing an unexpected incident that might cost his son’s life. He couldn’t bear to see it.

The golden Epoch Bell radiated radiant light, protecting Luo Tian as he appeared on Duan Shen Cliff. The surroundings were grey and hazy; Luo Tian dared not use his consciousness, relying instead on the Purple Extreme Demon Eyes to discern direction. In his vision, three green figures were in the distance—Luo Tian’s eyes could only see a vague outline.

The Epoch Bell protected him as he followed Li Chengen and the two elders at a distance, hoping to catch them off guard. If he could kill these three old men on Duan Shen Cliff, it would mean the Thunder Domain had no strength to oppose Tianyuan. Luo Tian was confident he could sacrifice a few late-stage Saints and still have the upper hand.

Li Chengen and the two elders walked five hundred feet, stopping at the mountain’s waist. Their faces bore a hint of joy as they passed through the thick fog, seeing several herbs swaying gently. Though not precious Saint-level herbs, they felt their age was terrifyingly high.

“Almost there! Almost there!” Their hearts were tense, as if seeing the ultimate Saint herb beckoning them. Their eyes glowed with excitement.

They quickened their pace, walking another two hundred feet. Though the cliff’s peak was near, it sent a chill through their hearts.

Soon, Li Chengen and the two elders reached a stone wall with a pool of blood splattered on it.

“What… what is this blood?” The three were stunned, their faces filled with shock. They felt an immense pressure from the blood, even Li Chengen’s Sainthood Apex cultivation caused his blood to churn violently. A sense of submission emanated from his blood.

“Puke…” The two late-stage Saint elders immediately vomited, their blood uncontrollably rushing toward the golden blood.

Luo Tian stood at a distance, his face filled with shock. His purple eyes glowed with intensity as a sense of kinship passed through his mind.

“Only one body type can have such an effect on our blood—subjugating and submitting!”

“This is the blood of a Reincarnation Body! And it’s one at the peak of an Epoch!” Li Chengen spoke in disbelief, his eyes filled with shock.

“An Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body—heard that it could withstand an Epoch Master. Is this true?” Li Chengen’s face bore admiration.

“Such a mighty being, how could it have bled here on the mountain waist!” The two late-stage Saints also bore admiration.

“An Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body, bled here—unless two Epoch Masters joined forces, who could make an Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body bleed on Duan Shen Cliff!” Their hearts were filled with fear.
