"Ke Xindie!" Ke Xinxi's face showed an excited expression as she gazed at the woman standing before her—Jiang Sxi, the one she had long sought to surpass.

"Damn it, I'd rather have drawn Luo Tian!" Ke Xinshui cursed inwardly.

Ke Xindie was a Four-source Immortal. Even against an ordinary Five-source Immortal who had not yet grasped the Dao, she could hold her own with the Zhuque Ancestral Flame. Yet against Jiang Sxi, even Ke Xinshui had no confidence—Jiang Sxi was a Five-source Immortal and renowned across the realm.

"Reincarnation Sword Technique!" As Ke Xinshui was momentarily stunned, Yang Dingtian, who had been impatiently waiting, already wielded his twin swords and charged at Luo Tian with a lethal strike, the force of which shook the heavens.

"Reincarnation Path!" Sensing the two swords forming a storm, Luo Tian's face turned grave. He silently marveled at Yang Dingtian's prowess—this was one of the four minor titans, equal to Jiang Sxi.

"Reincarnation!" Yet Luo Tian's face bore no fear. His eyes flashed like lightning as he launched a punch of reincarnation.

"Boom..." The thunderous impact shattered the two storms with a single fist, radiating overwhelming might.

"Think this is over?" Yang Dingtian stood motionless, his face cold.

"A hum..." The shattered storm sent invisible waves against Luo Tian's body, causing his robes to flutter violently. His face showed shock.

The formidable reincarnation power surged into Luo Tian's body, directly targeting his three divine souls. The immense tearing force sought to rip them from him.

"Unmatched reincarnation power! This is far stronger than my Reincarnation Fist!" Luo Tian inwardly marveled, sweat beading on his brow. He struggled to suppress it but could not control the force.

"A hum..." Sensing Luo Tian was no easy opponent, the reincarnation essence stirred and formed a narrow path within his body.

"Only by understanding reincarnation can one break through!" Luo Tian cursed himself for underestimating the power. He had assumed his Reincarnation Fist would suffice.

"I've reincarnated nine times and wield the Reincarnation Fist! I won't let you defeat me!" Luo Tian's face darkened. His three divine souls sat in meditation within his body.

Seeing Luo Tian stand still, Yang Dingtian showed no mercy. His killing intent surged as he leapt forward with twin swords, their blades emitting a blinding light that streaked like a meteor toward Luo Tian.

"Unity of Heaven and Humanity!" Luo Tian roared, closing his eyes. This was the only way he could counteract the reincarnation essence within him—though it was a temporary fix, it bought time.

Luo Tian gradually calmed. At the same moment, Yang Dingtian's sword intent struck him with a sense of vengeance.

"A hum..." The strike was delivered, but there was no sound of flesh being pierced. Yang Dingtian's eyes widened in surprise.

"An illusion! The Path of Space!" He realized too late as a grey fist struck him from behind.

"Boom..." Yang Dingtian, caught off guard, was struck directly in the back by Luo Tian's fist.

Luo Tian had underestimated Yang Dingtian, and vice versa. Both had assumed the other was too preoccupied with the reincarnation essence to act, but Luo Tian had found a way to counter it in short order.

Before Yang Dingtian could retaliate, Luo Tian's next punch arrived instantly. This time, Yang Dingtian was prepared and raised a domain barrier, buying himself a brief moment to breathe.

"Unity of Heaven and Humanity—how long can you sustain it?" Yang Dingtian roared, his body surging forward with twin swords radiating brilliance. He was undeterred and charged toward Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian is truly formidable! I didn't expect him to match Yang Dingtian evenly!" Qinglong Sect disciples marveled, whispering among themselves as they watched Luo Tian clash with Yang Dingtian.

Sima Qiong's face bore a bitter smile. He could clearly sense Luo Tian was still enduring, relying on the Unity of Heaven and Humanity state. Once he exited that realm, it would be dangerous.

"A scream!" A cry echoed, drawing everyone's attention to another arena.

"It's Jiang Sxi!" Qinglong Sect disciples shouted in excitement, gazing at their sect's top prodigy, Jiang Sxi.

Blood spurted violently as a red figure fell to the ground from the sky, his handsome face filled with hatred.

"Cut off your arms. No second chance. If you harm Qinglong Sect disciples again, you won't be so lucky!" Jiang Sxi's cold voice echoed through the sky as she gazed at Ke Xindie, who had lost both arms.

"Jiang Sxi!" Ke Xindie's face was filled with endless hatred. She had never suffered such a grievous wound or humiliation before.

What hurt her most was Jiang Sxi's gaze—like looking at a fly. That indifference made her pride worthless before Jiang Sxi, and her dream of defeating Jiang Sxi in the ranking battle crumbled.

"Spit..." Ke Xindie spat blood again, her consciousness controlling her arms back to her shoulders.

Jiang Sxi ignored Ke Xindie's vengeful gaze, her face calm as she slowly descended from the sacred platform. The outcome was clear; there was no need for her to stay.

"It's not over! I'll fight you to the end!" Ke Xindie's face twisted with ferocity, her red figure rising into the sky. She charged toward Jiang Sxi.

The crescent moon sword, like a crescent in the night, was not only fueled by her essence but also her cultivation and life force. This strike could wound a Six-source Immortal.

"Madness!" Seeing Ke Xindie abandon her name, Ke Zhen Tian could no longer sit still. He roared and extended his hand, time seemingly freezing as he grabbed Ke Xindie before him. With a slap, he struck her face.

The slap brought Ke Xindie some clarity but her face still bore hatred.

"This match is over. Ke Xindie has lost!" Ke Zhen Tian announced to the Grand Master.

"Go back!" He halted Ke Xindie's burning essence and life force, snorted coldly, and flung her toward the Zhuque Sect's area.

At that moment, Jiang Sxi stood beside Sima Qiong under the fervent gaze of Qinglong Sect disciples.

"Thank you," Sima Qiong whispered, his voice only audible to Jiang Sxi and himself.

"A crackling sound..." A thunderous noise echoed as another match between Ke Xinshui and Chen Leyi neared its end.

A fiery red fan's illusion struck an obsidian tortoise's illusion, and the tortoise's shell shattered in people's eyes.

"Ah cough..." Chen Leyi coughed, blood trickling from his lips. Yet he still wore a foolish smile.

"I surrender!" Chen Leyi addressed the Grand Master, his gaze toward Ke Xinshui with a touch of admiration.

Xuanwu Sect disciples were known for defense, lacking the ferocity to attack. The Xuanwu Divine Beast was renowned as the strongest defense among the Four Sacred Beasts. To break Chen Leyi's defense proved Ke Xinshui's attack was formidable.

"Chen Xiong, you've won!" Ke Xinshui spoke, but his gaze was on Jiang Sxi. His eyes held a cold glint.

Ke Xinshui had been watching the battle between Ke Xindie and Jiang Sxi. His sister's loss of both arms had torn his heart.

With the end of their battle, only Luo Tian and Yang Dingtian remained among the three groups of four sects.

Yang Dingtian felt a flicker of anxiety. The battle among the four minor titans had left his match unfinished, and it felt embarrassing.

"Damn it! Wake up!" Yang Dingtian's body was already battered. The Luo Tian in the Unity of Heaven and Humanity state was too elusive; each punch was not to be underestimated.

"Reincarnation Sword Technique!" Yang Dingtian retreated, using the Reincarnation Sword Technique again. Two storms roared forward and collided with Luo Tian trailing behind.

Luo Tian was thrown backward, the immense reincarnation essence surging into his body again. His eyelids twitched slightly.

"It's waking up! Again!" Yang Dingtian spared no effort, not hesitating to expend his reincarnation essence. He unleashed the Reincarnation Sword Technique again, his body moving like lightning as twin swords slashed across the sky. The cross-shaped sword energy sliced toward Luo Tian.

The thunderous sound echoed within Luo Tian's body. As Yang Dingtian's two reincarnation essences entered his body, finally, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes.

Strange waves formed in Luo Tian's eyes, creating a cycle before vanishing. The reincarnation essence Yang Dingtian had injected into Luo Tian emitted a humming sound, as if losing power. It settled quietly within Luo Tian's elixir field.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the cross-shaped sword energy approaching him. His aura surged skyward, lifting his long hair.

"Four-source Immortal!" The four minor titans' faces showed surprise as they gazed at Luo Tian. They hadn't expected him to reach the Four-source Immortal state during battle.

"Previously, he was contemplating reincarnation essence. This boy is truly a prodigy!" Chen Xuanning sighed, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian has ascended!" Qinglong Sect disciples shouted loudly, their faces filled with fervor. At this moment, Luo Tian had firmly established his status in the hearts of Qinglong Sect disciples.

At the same time, Yang Dingtian's cross-shaped sword energy reached Luo Tian. Two essence forces surged into the blade, carrying immense pressure that made people fear.

"Shatter!" Luo Tian remained indifferent. He launched a punch, and the reincarnation essence power erupted from his fist.

The thunderous sound echoed throughout the barrier. Luo Tian shattered the cross-shaped sword energy, his aura undiminished. His body resembled a golden eagle breaking through smoke and launched another punch at Yang Dingtian, who had now reached him.

Chapter 771: The Battle of Ke Xinshui

Yang Dingtian's face bore disbelief. His expression twisted as blood spewed uncontrollably.

"Boom..." Yang Dingtian's body collided with the barrier but seemed unaffected. His gaze remained on Luo Tian standing proudly before him.

"It's impossible... Impossible..." Yang Dingtian whispered, unable to fathom how Luo Tian could grasp the path of reincarnation so quickly.

What hurt Yang Dingtian most was that Luo Tian had discovered the path of reincarnation by using the three reincarnation essences he had injected into Luo Tian's body.

Four-source Immortal, Luo Tian's face bore confidence. He had never feared a Four-source Immortal. Now that he had grasped the path of reincarnation and fully entered the Four-source state, his combat power had doubled.

"Boom..." Lightning flashed around Luo Tian's body as he charged toward Yang Dingtian, resembling a primordial beast.

Yang Dingtian had been battered by Luo Tian before. Now, after that punch, he was exhausted and injured. The balance of power had shifted.

"Crack..." Lightning flashed as Yang Dingtian suppressed his urge to spit blood, raising his twin swords and striking Luo Tian. The clash of weapons produced a piercing sound. A violent aura rose at their meeting point, sparks flying everywhere.

"Boom..." Yang Dingtian's body collided with the barrier again. Blood stained the barrier.

"A hum..." Luo Tian took two steps back, his body trembling slightly. He sighed in admiration for Yang Dingtian's prowess as a prodigy of the era while stepping into the void, transforming into a streak of lightning and charging toward Yang Dingtian again.

The Splitting Heaven Spear transformed into a black dragon, its cold tip piercing toward Yang Dingtian.

Yang Dingtian's eyes showed fear. He felt Luo Tian's spear was impossibly fast and forced his body to twist.

"Pu..." The spear pierced Yang Dingtian's shoulder, passing through his body and embedding into the barrier.

"Ahh..." Yang Dingtian roared. His four essences erupted, attempting to break free from the barrier.

But in an instant, a blood-red halberd appeared before Yang Dingtian's eyes. The war spear radiated a bloodthirsty aura and pierced into Yang Dingtian's throat.

"Roar..." A blood-red dragon emerged from the halberd, roaring into Yang Dingtian's body and instantly draining all his blood energy.

Blood energy surrounded the halberd, which radiated a crimson glow. Luo Tian seized it in his hand, and the overwhelming blood energy calmed.

This halberd was the weapon Yang Huanyu had left for Luo Tian. Now, Luo Tian used it to kill Yang Dingtian.

"Alas... My apologies! Blades have no eyes!" Luo Tian exhaled softly, his low voice echoing toward the Baihu Sect.

"Dead! Yang Dingtian is dead!" People's faces showed fear as they gazed at the lifeless Yang Dingtian, shouting in unison.

"A hum..." Jin Yongsi's face was grim. He sat on the Baihu throne, trembling slightly. The sky behind him cracked.

Yang Fei's death was painful but bearable for Jin Yongsi. However, Yang Dingtian's death made him feel like vomiting blood.

"Um... My apologies, Jin Xiong. Blades have no eyes. This kid truly deserved punishment!" Sha Cangmang's face showed sorrow, but his eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

Hearing the four words "Blades have no eyes," Jin Yongsi's face turned iron-gray. His gaze locked onto Luo Tian, his eyes filled with intense killing intent.

The Baihu Sect disciples were gloomy. Their sect's two prodigies had been killed by Luo Tian. The Baihu Sect's younger generation was now gone, and it would inevitably finish last in the ranking battle. Even the usually last-ranked Xuanwu Sect would surpass Baihu.

"From now on, the four minor titans have changed!" Qinglong Sect's side was jubilant. Disciples cheered loudly. It was nearly certain that Qinglong Sect would win first place in this competition. If Luo Tian had killed Yang Dingtian, the four minor titans would surely have a place for Luo Tian.

Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi both entered the top three. Their scores would certainly be high. Combined with previous matches, Qinglong Sect's score had already far surpassed the other three sects. Even without determining first and second place, Qinglong Sect was undeniably the winner.

"Alas, I never expected Yang Dingtian to die so miserably, drained of his blood energy!" Other small sects' people also murmured, gazing at Luo Tian with a touch of respect.

Ke Xinshui stood in the Zhuque Sect's gathering place, his face showing a grim expression. He knew Yang Dingtian's strength was slightly weaker than himself, but to kill Yang Dingtian would cost him a price. He wouldn't have done it as easily as Luo Tian.

"Damn it, what kind of monster is this? He ascended to Four-source Immortal during battle!" Ke Xindie's face was pale. His gaze toward Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi bore endless hatred. At this moment, he regarded them as thorns in his flesh.

"Xin Die, lend me the Zhuque Ancestral Flame. Otherwise, I can't match them!" Ke Xinshui addressed Ke Xindie.

"Sister!" Ke Xindie looked at Ke Xinshui with concern. Though she was arrogant, she understood human warmth. She knew Ke Xinshui loved her.

After witnessing Jiang Sxi and Luo Tian's strength, she wasn't sure if Ke Xinshui could match them. Plus, the grudge they had built up might cost her life.

At this moment, Ke Xindie fully understood Luo Tian's nature—that if anyone had a killing intent toward him, he would never give them a chance.

"Don't worry. I'll be fine. With the Zhuque Ancestral Flame protecting me, it's only a minor injury. I won't lose my life!" Seeing Ke Xindie's worry, Ke Xinshui smiled confidently.

Ke Xinshui gently patted Ke Xindie's head. "Sister, when you were bullied, I stepped in. It's normal. Don't worry! You don't know my strength yet!"

"Ah... Brother, be careful!" Hearing Ke Xinshui's words, Ke Xindie felt reassured. She remembered how whenever she was wronged in the past, Ke Xinshui had always stepped in to teach others a lesson. Even when facing someone stronger than Ke Xinshui, he had never lost.

"Next round, draw lots!" Luo Tian and others rested briefly. The Grand Master spoke softly, announcing the start of the next round.

Luo Tian, Jiang Sxi, and Ke Xinshui stepped onto the sacred platform. They exchanged glances. Ke Xinshui's gaze toward them was cold.

"Thinking of avenging your sister?" Luo Tian smiled, unbothered. He took out the lot and gazed at Ke Xinshui.

"Perhaps," Ke Xinshui, whose name meant 'calm as water,' was indifferent. He grabbed a bamboo stick and answered Luo Tian.

"It seems you still aren't satisfied with losing to me back then," Jiang Sxi smiled, recalling the time Ke Xinshui had challenged her at Qinglong Sect.

Back then, Ke Xinshui hadn't accepted Jiang Sxi's victory. He had challenged her at Qinglong Sect but lost a move, being struck in the chest and spitting blood. He had always held a grudge. If he had possessed the Zhuque Ancestral Flame back then, Ke Xinshui was certain Jiang Sxi wouldn't have been his match.

"Jiang Sxi is exempt. Luo Tian and Ke Xinshui will fight. The winner faces Jiang Sxi. The final victor is the champion of this strength battle!" The Grand Master announced, his voice echoing in people's ears.

"Ha! So to beat me, you have to beat him first!" Jiang Sxi smiled, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration. Though Ke Xinshui was a prodigy, she felt Luo Tian was even more extraordinary—perhaps even surpassing herself.

When Luo Tian had first arrived at Qinglong Sect, he was merely a boundary guardian. Over a year later, he had ascended to Four-source Immortal. Though Qinglong Sect's vast resources played a role, his talent was truly extraordinary.

"Fine, it doesn't matter who you choose," Ke Xinshui said indifferently. After all, both Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi had a grudge against Ke Xindie.

Jiang Sxi slowly descended from the sacred platform, leaving space for Luo Tian and Ke Xinshui.

"I have a question. Do you want to kill me?" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Ke Xinshui.

Luo Tian's words had barely finished when Baihu Sect disciples turned angry, glaring at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian had previously asked Yang Fei the same question. Yang Fei had shown him killing intent and was later killed by Luo Tian. Yang Dingtian had done the same, and he too was killed by Luo Tian. Now, Luo Tian asked again—adding salt to Baihu Sect's wounds.

"Not at all. Though you're despicable, your crimes don't warrant death," Ke Xinshui replied, gazing at Luo Tian. His battle spirit surged. He truly wanted to fight Luo Tian—after all, he was a prodigy. Fighting another prodigy would benefit his cultivation.

Luo Tian nodded inwardly. He didn't sense real killing intent in Ke Xinshui's eyes. He was puzzled—were Ke Xinshui and Ke Xindie really siblings? Their personalities were so different.

As Luo Tian mused, the Grand Master announced the start of their battle. As soon as the words were spoken, Ke Xinshui's attack came instantly—a blue fan appeared in his hand and attacked Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was slightly surprised. He had never seen anyone use a fan as a weapon before.

But in an instant, his expression turned grave. He could clearly feel Ke Xinshui's strength was far greater than Yang Dingtian's.

Chapter 772: The Killing God's Fist

On the sacred platform, Luo Tian and Ke Xinshui continuously attacked each other. Thunderous sounds rose with every collision, leaving the onlookers in awe.

"Evenly matched!" At this moment, people could only use these four words to describe Luo Tian and Ke Xinshui.

Luo Tian's face bore a grim expression. Ke Xinshui's tenacity exceeded his expectations. He was confident that even against Jiang Sxi, he wouldn't fear. Yet he hadn't expected Ke Xinshui to match him evenly.

"Two Dao essences!" After several clashes, Luo Tian sensed Ke Xinshui had grasped two Dao essences—one was the Path of Life and Death, another was the Path of Space like Luo Tian. The remaining two were Water and Fire essences.

Luo Tian was amazed by Ke Xinshui's strength, while Ke Xinshui marveled at Luo Tian's tenacity. Not confronting him, he wouldn't have known how tenacious Luo Tian was. In just a moment, Ke Xinshui's body bore several wounds. Though it didn't affect his strength, it made him look disheveled.

The spear and fan collided. Both retreated,默契ly not attacking again immediately. They both panted heavily, gazing at each other.

"You're strong. Among the people I know, besides Jiang Sxi, you are the strongest," Ke Xinshui suppressed his inner reincarnation power and panted, gazing at Luo Tian.

"You are too!" Luo Tian replied. He felt that merely clashing with Ke Xinshui for a moment had cost him a thousand years of lifespan. His expression was grave.

"But no one has ever insulted my sister and walked away unscathed!" Ke Xinshui's face turned cold. He formed hand signs, and four-colored essence forces transformed into runes covering his body. His aura gradually rose, a flame mark appearing on his forehead.

"Is that the Zhuque Bloodline Power?" Sand Cangmang, Jin Yongsi, and Chen Xuanning's faces showed surprise. They gazed at Ke Xinshui.

"Yes, it is the Zhuque Bloodline Power. Ke Xinshui and Ke Xindie once entered the Zhuque Sect's ancestral grounds. Ke Xindie obtained the Zhuque Ancestral Flame, while Ke Xinshui received the Zhuque Bloodline Power. In essence, Ke Xinshui is no different from a descendant of the divine beast Zhuque."

Hearing Ke Zhen Tian's proud narration, Sand Cangmang and the others showed shock. The Four Sacred Beasts were all Nine-source Immortals with immense power and strength. Their bloodlines made them stronger than ordinary Nine-source Immortals, which was why they had guarded the four sects for countless years.

Ke Xinshui's aura grew stronger. The Zhuque Ancestral Flame radiated from his body, making his power overwhelming.

"Five-source!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed. His expression was grave, and his hands began to change.

"Besides not grasping the Dao essence, Ke Xiong's current strength is nearly Five-source. How can Qinglong Sect's disciple fight him?" Zhuque Sect disciples said with pride, mocking.

Ke Xindie's face showed joy. She gazed at Luo Tian. Few knew that Ke Xinshui and Ke Xindie had entered the Zhuque Sect's ancestral grounds. The Zhuque Bloodline Power and Zhuque Ancestral Flame were both obtained by Ke Xinshui. However, he had given the Zhuque Ancestral Flame to his sister out of affection. Essentially, the Zhuque Ancestral Flame was Ke Xinshui's.

"Boom..." In a few heartbeats, Ke Xinshui's aura reached its peak. He gazed at Luo Tian.

"Now, what do you have left to fight me with?" Ke Xinshui's face bore confidence as he spoke. But the next moment, his eyes narrowed.

"Roar..." A nine-colored tiger appeared in people's sight. Light flashed, its crimson eyes radiating a savage aura. The king's power thundered within the barrier.

"White Tiger Transformation! How could he use White Tiger Transformation!" The onlookers showed disbelief, gazing at the massive nine-colored tiger within the barrier.

White Tiger Transformation was a unique technique of Baihu Sect, only for direct descendants. People were confused—how could Luo Tian, a Qinglong Sect disciple, use it?

"This boy must die!" Jin Yongsi's eyes glowed with killing intent. Luo Tian had now crossed his limits and become a target for Jin Yongsi.

The thunderous sound echoed as the nine-colored tiger surged into Luo Tian's body, turning his eyes crimson. Like Ke Xinshui, he was just one step away from Five-source Immortal.

Ke Xinshui's eyes flickered with surprise. He threw his fan into the air, formed hand signs, and gazed at Luo Tian with battle spirit.

"Crash..." The fan rapidly expanded in the sky. Under Luo Tian's astonished gaze, it slowly opened.

"Boom..." The red Zhuque Ancestral Flame roared out, forming runes that surged toward Luo Tian. Simultaneously, blue water essence transformed into runes and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Life-Death Prohibition!" Ke Xinshui roared, his eyes filled with confidence. This was his strongest attack—three essences fused into one.

"Life-Death Prohibition! It seems you intend to make this boy your successor!" Sand Cangmang smiled, gazing at Ke Zhen Tian.

Chen Xuanning and Jin Yongsi's gazes toward Ke Xinshui also changed slightly.

"Ke Xinshui is a good child in both talent and character. He's suitable to be the successor! I'm just considering it for now," Ke Zhen Tian said, his face showing satisfaction as he gazed at Ke Xinshui.

Countless runes, imbued with Ke Xinshui's three essences, enveloped Luo Tian. His face bore a grim expression.

Luo Tian stood still, as if in an impossible situation. Before him, fire roared; behind him, the sea surged. One wrong step meant life or death.

"Seems I underestimated the prodigies of the Four Sacred Beasts," Luo Tian sighed. When he had faced Yang Dingtian, if he hadn't grasped the reincarnation essence, he would have been in danger.

Now, Ke Xinshui's Life-Death Prohibition was even more terrifying than Yang Dingtian's Reincarnation Sword Technique. It made Luo Tian realize where he differed from these Four Sacred Beasts' prodigies.

It was the cultivation base. Yes, it was the base—whether in techniques or weapons, Luo Tian had been among the top on Tianyuan Continent. But against the Four Sacred Beasts, his methods were clearly insufficient. Except for the Chaos Seal, other techniques were even weaker than a punch enhanced by his essence.

The prodigies of the Four Sacred Beasts were different. They were core disciples of their sects, and their sect's inheritance techniques were numerous. The Four Sacred Beasts' domain was vast; oddities were plentiful. Thus, the only difference between Luo Tian and these prodigies was his lack of powerful techniques.

Although Qinglong Sect's resources were available to Luo Tian, Sand Cangmang had never given him techniques or martial arts.

"Terrifying technique!" Luo Tian marveled, sensing the surrounding world changed. His hands moved swiftly.

"Luo Tian is in danger! This Life-Death Prohibition is the Zhuque Sect's secret technique. Luo Tian's strength isn't much worse than Ke Xinshui's, but he lacks powerful techniques. He'll lose because of this!" Sima Qiong sighed, gazing at Luo Tian who stood still with his hands moving.

Hearing Sima Qiong's words, Qinglong Sect disciples showed disappointment. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to lose due to techniques, which felt frustrating.

"Chaos Seal!" Luo Tian waved his hand. The Chaos Seal instantly formed, radiating overwhelming power as it smashed toward the firestorm. His face bore indifference, one punch to destroy life, two punches for reincarnation.

"Two punches aren't enough! I need a third!" Luo Tian roared, his face showing madness. He waved his hand, and the world's power began to gather around him.

"That's the World Power! How can a Four-source Immortal control it!" The onlookers showed confusion, gazing at the invisible waves gathering in Luo Tian's hands.

World Power was a power that only Heaven-Immortals could control. The reason Heaven-Immortals were strong was their mastery over this power. Now, Luo Tian had gathered World Power as a Four-source Immortal—how could people not be amazed?

Luo Tian smiled. This was his first time gathering World Power. Others couldn't, but Luo Tian had briefly entered the Six-source Heaven-Immortal state and felt the World Power that only Heaven-Immortals could sense. It was thanks to this brief insight that he now understood it.

"No technique, I'll create one. Third punch—Killing God!" Luo Tian whispered to himself. He soared into the sky, his face filled with confidence as he took a step.

"Boom..." At the same time, the Chaos Seal slowly formed in the sky. The Chaos essence surged into it and smashed toward the ocean behind Luo Tian.

As the Chaos Seal struck the ocean, creating a towering wave, Luo Tian's third punch—Killing God—arrived instantly. His body broke through the firestorm, as if breaking free from life and death's constraints. He reached Ke Xinshui, his third punch imbued with World Power, smashing toward him.

Ke Xinshui hadn't expected Luo Tian to escape the Life-Death Prohibition so quickly. His face showed surprise, and he raised a domain barrier. His body emitted a phoenix's cry as the Zhuque Bloodline Power reached its peak. He clenched his fist, unafraid, and collided with Luo Tian.

"Crack..." Thunder flashed around their collision. The firestorm behind them roared, and the sea surged violently—leaving people in awe.

Chapter 773: I Surrender

On the sacred platform, powerful waves shook the barrier. Other sects' matches had ended. People's faces showed admiration as they gazed at the two figures colliding.

"Killing God!" Luo Tian roared, breaking through the Zhuque Ancestral Flame. He stepped on the Heaven-Striding Steps and instantly appeared before Ke Xinshui, launching a punch.

Ke Xinshui's face trembled. His eyes showed madness as his four essences converged, and he unleashed all his strength. He clenched his fist and collided with Luo Tian's Killing God punch.

"Crack..." Thunder flashed around them. It was as if a thunderclap echoed in the heavy sky.

When their fists met, Ke Xinshui's face showed shock. He felt as if facing a tyrant of the world, his entire body trembling uncontrollably.

"Pu..." In an instant, Ke Xinshui's body was thrown backward. Blood gushed from his mouth.

"Controlling World Power is truly terrifying!" Luo Tian muttered, inwardly marveling at the power of World Power. He hadn't fully grasped it yet—only because he had briefly entered the Six-source Heaven-Immortal state, allowing him to sense it.

The onlookers showed astonishment as they watched Ke Xinshui slowly rise. They hadn't expected such a powerful opponent to be thrown back by Luo Tian.

"He once ascended to Six-source Immortal!" Sha Cangmang frowned, his face showing a strange expression as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Chen Xuanning and Jin Yongsi's faces also showed admiration. They gazed at Luo Tian standing there, their eyes filled with a touch of amazement. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to truly break through the Zhuque Sect's Life-Death Prohibition.

"His strength isn't enough. If Ke Xinshui had reached Six-source Heaven-Immortal, the Life-Death Prohibition's power would have surged another level. It could even trap a Seven-source Immortal!" Ke Zhen Tian shook his head.

Seeing one punch throw Ke Xinshui back, Luo Tian didn't want to give him a chance. He took a step forward and charged toward Ke Xinshui.

"I won't lose!" Ke Xinshui slowly stood up, wiping blood from his lips. He forced himself to suppress the serious injuries.

He pushed off the ground, and his body soared into the sky. The Zhuque Ancestral Flame enveloped him, forming a phoenix's illusion that let out a series of cries.

"Still not giving up!" Luo Tian struck empty air, gazing at Ke Xinshui in the sky. He pushed off the ground without fear and charged toward him, his body enveloped by emerald green flames.
