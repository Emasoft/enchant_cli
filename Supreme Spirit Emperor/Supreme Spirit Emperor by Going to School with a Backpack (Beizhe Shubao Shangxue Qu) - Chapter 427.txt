“ I came to have dinner with you! ” Shi Dalì looked at Luo Tian and spoke loudly, causing Luo Tian’s ears to hurt again.

“ Ah, okay! ” Luo Tian nodded and followed Shi Dalì toward the place where everyone was eating.

As usual, it was lively—tall giants shouting constantly, a beast of unknown origin roasted over fire, emitting fragrant smells.

“ Luo大哥 has arrived! ” The giants who knew Luo Tian welcomed him and led him to the seat.

Under everyone’s enthusiasm, Luo Tian had a lively dinner, then spent some time with the crowd before returning to Chu Chen’s residence.

Time passed quickly; soon, Luo Tian settled in the territory of Nanling. Though he was a bit uncomfortable and often disturbed by the thunderous snoring at night, life was peaceful enough, waiting for his cultivation to recover.

Time flowed slowly; a month had passed since Luo Tian took the Reverse Blood Pill, but his cultivation showed no signs of recovery. This made him anxious.

During these days, Chu Chen was always out early and back late, returning with a hint of sorrow on his face. Though he tried to hide it well, Luo Tian could not miss the signs.

“ What’s wrong? ” That day, after dinner with Chu Chen, Luo Tian looked at him and asked.

“ Nothing! ” Chu Chen smiled, trying not to worry Luo Tian. After all, Luo Tian’s current identity was sensitive, and without any cultivation, he could not help much.

“ Tell me what’s happening! Don’t bear it alone! Are you looking down on me because I’m a broken man? ” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his gaze turning severe.

Chapter 1672: Chu Chen's Ascension ()

“ Tell me, I might be able to help! ” Luo Tian’s face was serious as he looked at Chu Chen.

Seeing Luo Tian truly angry, Chu Chen dared not defy him. He sighed deeply and told Luo Tian about the troubles he had encountered.

“ We killed Qiyuxuan and that youth from the Fei clan on that continent. Their status was high, they were direct descendants; their fathers held high positions in both clans! ”

“ They died, but I, who guided them, am alive. Naturally, this raised suspicion from both clans. A few days ago, people from both clans came to investigate. I didn’t admit it, saying they hadn’t followed my instructions and acted on their own. As for how they died, I didn’t know! ”

“ But these excuses could only buy time. The royal family has many methods. If they were high in their clans, eventually they would find me out. Then, for the sake of three clans’ relations, the蛮族 might even sacrifice this small half-Epoch to save face! ”

“ Moreover, over the years in the Wild City, I’ve made many enemies. Also, the old rivals of the Shi clan have suspected we were the original Shi clan and set traps! ” Chu Chen recounted everything honestly, his face bitter.

“ Then what have you been doing these past days? ” Luo Tian sighed deeply, realizing this was his fault.

“ The prince of the蛮族 returned from outside recently but seemed injured. I planned to find someone extraordinary who could heal that prince. If so, the achievement would be great and surely attract Master Saban’s attention. Even if I had major faults, they might be covered up! ” Chu Chen explained his plan to Luo Tian.

“ Foolish boy! ” Luo Tian smiled, thinking Chu Chen’s idea was good but short of time—where could he find someone to heal Chen Zhanbiao?

“ How is the prince doing now? ” Then Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, asking about Chen Zhanbiao’s condition. If it was really bad, he would risk exposing his identity to check.

“ I heard it wasn’t serious, but he’s been in a deep sleep. Other than that, everything was normal! ” Chu Chen reported what he had heard. After all, he was only a half-Epoch; in the Wild City filled with strong people, he wasn’t much. Even meeting Master Saban was rare.

“ Hmm, that’s okay! ” Luo Tian nodded. His current state was worse than Chen Zhanbiao’s.

“ Don’t run around recklessly. Stay here for now, and I’ll help you boost your strength! ” Luo Tian smiled at Chu Chen.

“ Strength is the hard truth. If you were an Epoch peak, few would dare to touch you in the Wild City! ” Luo Tian shook his head.

“ Ah, but short-term reaching Epoch peak is harder than climbing the sky! ” Chu Chen sighed. He was a half-Epoch now; reaching Epoch peak was like climbing the sky. To reach that level, he estimated at least a thousand years—this even with great opportunities.

“ Alright, step by step. Don’t I’m here? Even if you’re a commoner, I can still push you to Epoch peak! ” Luo Tian patted Chu Chen’s shoulder habitually.

Boosting strength was difficult for others, but for Luo Tian, a master of elixirs, it wasn’t a big problem. His concern was ensuring Chu Chen wouldn’t have lasting side effects.

“ Three days later, come to me! ” Luo Tian smiled confidently. He had many elixirs in his storage ring, though he couldn’t eat them now. Chu Chen could, and recently he had studied medicine and acupuncture deeply—boosting Chu Chen’s strength wasn’t too hard.

“ Yes! ” Chu Chen nodded, trusting Luo Tian completely. He built a small house for Luo Tian alone and added some simple arrays to block out the snoring.

Three days passed quietly. On the third day, as dawn broke, Chu Chen arrived at Luo Tian’s small house with excitement. As Luo Tian said, strength was the hard truth—especially in the蛮族, where might made right. If he reached Epoch, his status would change completely from now.

Before Chu Chen could speak, Luo Tian stepped out of the room with a smile and stood on Chu Chen’s palm, which he then took in. After all, to enter the Epoch realm, one must endure the greatest trial—Epoch’s calamity.

“ Let’s go! ” Chu Chen stepped out of the territory, leaving the Wild City toward the outside of the蛮族 continent. A moment later, they appeared beyond the star domain, choosing a remote uninhabited island far from the Wild Continent.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s figure appeared on the ground. He said, “ Return to normal size! ”

“ Yes! ” Chu Chen naturally trusted Luo Tian. His hands moved, and he transformed into a figure two heads taller than Luo Tian, standing before him.

“ Sit down. It might be painful, but it’ll pass! ” Luo Tian smiled and took out a package of silver needles, looking at Chu Chen.

“ Uh… ” Seeing the cold glinting silver needles, Chu Chen felt uneasy but followed Luo Tian’s instructions and sat cross-legged.

“ Hum… ” Without hesitation, Luo Tian took a needle and pierced it into the acupoint.

“ Uh… ” After the first needle, Chu Chen’s face changed slightly, sweat beading on his forehead.

Luo Tian watched the blood flow down the needle and immediately pulled it out, looking apologetic.

“ Brother, why is it so painful… ” Chu Chen opened his eyes, looking at Luo Tian with confusion.

“ Pain is normal. To gain something, you must pay! ” Luo Tian’s gaze turned serious as he comforted Chu Chen.

“ Okay! ” Chu Chen gritted his teeth, though confused, he trusted Luo Tian and closed his eyes again.

The humming echoed; Luo Tian felt guilty but quickly pushed another needle into Chu Chen’s body.

“ One… two… ” Luo Tian continued to insert needles, though there were many mistakes, eventually finding the acupoints.

Three days passed quietly; under Luo Tian’s effort and Chu Chen’s painful screams, the eighty-one acupoints on Chu Chen were finally filled with silver needles. His aura gradually rose, and his body emitted a series of roaring sounds.

“ Eat this! ” Luo Tian took out an elixir and placed it in Chu Chen’s mouth.

“ Boom… boom… boom… ” When Chu Chen swallowed the elixir, his dantian roared fiercely. His aura surged rapidly and soon reached its limit.

Black calamity clouds gathered slowly, terrifying pressure instantly making Luo Tian barely withstand it. He summoned three-headed dogs and stood on their heads, disappearing from the uninhabited island.

“ Crack… ” Golden lightning descended, striking Chu Chen who sat cross-legged with a rising aura.

But Chu Chen remained seated without moving, allowing the golden lightning to strike his powerful body.

The roaring echoed; the entire uninhabited island trembled with the thunder’s descent. Finally, Chu Chen slowly opened his eyes, gazing at the black calamity clouds above with a serious expression.

“ Hum… ” A supreme Dao energy spread out, red lightning slicing through the sky, forming a thunder dragon roaring toward Chu Chen.

Chu Chen’s eyes were serious but he leaped forward, rushing at the red lightning dragon to fight it.

“ Hum… ” Just as Chu Chen approached the dragon, a green light flashed, and a green blade appeared above his head.

“ Rest and wait for your ascension! ” Luo Tian smiled, speaking to Chu Chen.

Chu Chen was stunned; the terrifying lightning he saw was absorbed completely by the green sword above him.

Then, Chu Chen was utterly stunned as a series of powerful, apocalyptic calamities were absorbed by the sword emitting supreme aura.

“ Hum… ” The calamity clouds slowly dissipated, and Chu Chen stood there stunned, emitting an aura of the initial Epoch.

“ Is that all? ” Chu Chen felt the explosive power within his body but was still unaccustomed.

“ Foolish boy! ” Luo Tian chuckled, but then his brow furrowed slightly. He quickly retrieved the Heaven-Defying Thunder Sword and said, “ Someone is coming—hide us! ”

“ Yes! ” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Chu Chen’s face slightly tensed and he flew up, immediately hiding Luo Tian.

“ Hum… ” Just as Chu Chen hid Luo Tian, two tall figures appeared before him, their faces cold.

“ Chu Chen, come with us! ” One of them, a giant with a scar on his face, sensed Chu Chen’s aura and glared at him coldly.

Chapter 1673: The Old Rivals of the Shi Clan ()

“ You! ” Chu Chen looked at them, especially noticing the complex tattoo on their robes. His face darkened immediately.

“ The Divine Guard of the蛮族! ” Chu Chen whispered, looking at them, unsure what had happened to draw the attention of the Divine Guard.

The Divine Guard was the core force of the蛮族. To join it, one must reach the Epoch and pass a series of tests. The Divine Guard had certain privileges within the蛮族. Chu Chen had planned to try the Divine Guard’s test when he reached Epoch, but now that he had just entered it, the Divine Guard had already come for him.

“ What do you want with me? ” Chu Chen felt a bad premonition and asked the two Divine Guards.

“ Not sure, come with us! ” The two Divine Guards waved their hands, and a gray rope appeared in their hands.

“ Okay! ” Chu Chen nodded without resistance, allowing them to tie him with the gray rope. After all, there were many people in Nanling still in the Wild City; he couldn’t escape.

“ Let’s go! ” The two Divine Guards pulled the rope, leading Chu Chen as if he were a criminal toward the蛮族 continent.

Chu Chen had just entered Epoch, so his speed was much faster; otherwise, if he were still a half-Epoch, he might not have kept up with the two Divine Guards.

Three hours later, the two Divine Guards led Chu Chen to the Wild City’s outer gates. Upon arrival, they caused a stir.

“ Divine Guard! ” The two giants guarding the gates looked respectfully at the two cold-faced Divine Guards.

“ Who is that? ” People then saw the tied Chu Chen and looked confused.

“ Who is Chu Chen? I’ve never heard of him! ” Someone asked, as anyone who drew the Divine Guard’s attention was no ordinary person.

“ He was a clan leader of the Nanling faction who entered the Wild City years ago! I don’t know what he did to draw the Divine Guard’s attention! ” People murmured, realizing Chu Chen’s identity.

“ Nanling? I’ve never heard of it. A new small faction, right? How could it draw the Divine Guard’s attention? ”

“ Did you feel his cultivation was initial Epoch? ” People then sensed Chu Chen’s power, their eyes showing understanding. However, they knew that even if he survived, he would be beaten up; drawing the Divine Guard’s attention meant he might have committed a great crime.

The two Divine Guards seemed to ignore the surrounding murmurs, emitting an aura that warned others not to approach. They led Chu Chen toward the most sacred place in the Wild City—the Divine Temple.

Not long after, they entered the Divine Temple. Chu Chen said nothing, thinking about how to explain himself, as failure could mean death.

The two Divine Guards led Chu Chen into a large hall and then he saw several people seated on high chairs. His heart grew heavier.

In the center sat an old man, solemnly seated. On his sides were several middle-aged men. A middle-aged man in green robes sat beside the old man, while another middle-aged man in golden robes stood on the other side, his eyes cold.

“ Greetings to the Temple Lord! Chu Chen is here! ” The two Divine Guards bowed respectfully to the old man.

The old man radiated a peak-level aura, his eyes authoritative, and his body exuded waves of killing intent. He was clearly someone who had controlled others’ fates for years.

“ Greetings, Temple Lord! ” Chu Chen quickly bowed and showed respect. This man was Man Cheng, renowned throughout the蛮族 but with a notorious reputation; countless traitors of the蛮族 had died by his hand.

“ Hmm, untie him! ” Man Cheng nodded, surprised to see Chu Chen had reached the initial Epoch. He then nodded.

“ Are you Chu Chen? ” Man Cheng asked, his voice authoritative as he looked at Chu Chen, who had the gray rope removed.

“ Yes! ” Chu Chen nodded. Before Man Cheng, he felt no fear; if it came to ferocity, who could match the three-headed dogs? A few days ago, Luo Tian had let them train himself.

“ Good! The boy from the Qilin clan and the youth from the Fei clan were with you. Now they are dead. What do you have to say? ” Man Cheng’s eyes showed a hint of approval; few could remain calm before him.

“ Nothing to say. I led them through several continents, and then they acted on their own. I returned! As for what happened after, I don’t know! ” Chu Chen remained calm and composed. For these days, he had used this excuse repeatedly, so he couldn’t change it now.

“ Boy, you still dare to lie? Do you think we can’t handle you? ” Before Man Cheng could speak, the middle-aged man from the Qilin clan said coldly.

“ Boy, our clan’s royal power has already calculated that they were with you before their deaths. How long will you lie? Temple Lord, you won’t protect him for a small initial Epoch and ruin our clan relations! ” The middle-aged man in golden robes from the Fei clan smiled, looking at Man Cheng.

“ This matter has been informed to our clan leader, who said the killer of our clan must be returned! ” The Fei clan’s middle-aged man added, using the clan leader to pressure.

“ Our蛮族 matters don’t need your interference! ” Man Cheng’s face darkened slightly at their words, then he looked at Chu Chen.

“ Speak up! Now that you’re lying, it’s no use. If it wasn’t your fault, I’ll forgive you! ” Man Cheng’s gaze was authoritative as he looked at Chu Chen.

“ I… ” Chu Chen was about to lie again, but Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his mind, making his face slightly change.

“ What do you mean by ‘I’? Don’t you hurry up and speak! ” A middle-aged man from the蛮族, with a cold smile, looked at Chu Chen and shouted. His voice had waves that could震慑 people’s minds.

Chu Chen was momentarily stunned, then suddenly清醒, looking at the middle-aged man. Blood flowed from his mouth.

“ Meng Yunlong! ” Chu Chen felt a chill, seeing the middle-aged man’s mocking gaze. He knew he was in danger now; this Meng Yunlong was the descendant of the faction that had once pushed the Shi clan out of the Wild City.

“ Temple Lord, those two were indeed killed by me! ” Chu Chen’s face was serious as he spoke to Man Cheng.

“ Boy, you dare to kill our clan members? You’re really tired of living! ” Hearing Chu Chen’s admission, the middle-aged men from both the Qilin and Fei clans turned fierce. Their Epoch late-stage power pressed toward Chu Chen, and they stood up, eyes full of killing intent.

“ Sit down! ” Man Cheng coldly snorted, and an invisible wave of pressure radiated from him. The pressure pressing toward Chu Chen vanished instantly, and the two clan men were forcibly stopped, sitting back on their chairs.

“ Why did you kill them? ” Man Cheng subdued the two men, then stared intently at Chu Chen.

“ This was the situation… ” Chu Chen’s face was determined as he recounted what had happened, embellishing slightly to portray Qiyuxuan and the youth as villains, omitting Luo Tian’s involvement.

“ Lying! Boy, you’re fabricating lies! ” The two men from the Qilin and Fei clans said angrily.

“ Two, I’ve always done things openly in the蛮族. If you have evidence that they didn’t do it, I, Chu Chen, will be executed and swear blood! ” Chu Chen’s gaze was resolute as he looked at Man Cheng. He knew only Man Cheng could decide his fate.

“ He should be executed! ” Man Cheng’s face was solemn, his eyes cold. Being the head of the Divine Temple meant he was upright.

“ Temple Lord, are you really going to believe his words? Are you willing to ignore our clan relations for a small initial Epoch? ” Hearing Man Cheng’s words, the two clan representatives’ faces darkened. They heard that Man Cheng wanted to protect this boy.

“ Temple Lord, we can’t just take his word. I suggest we perform a soul search! ” Meng Yunlong smiled, speaking to Man Cheng.

“ Boy, blame it on your connection with the Shi clan. Better to kill the wrong than let the guilty go! ” Meng Yunlong smiled inwardly; he had long wanted to kill Chu Chen but lacked a good excuse. This was the perfect opportunity.

“ Soul search! ” Hearing Meng Yunlong’s words, Man Cheng fell silent. The two clan men’s eyes glowed with intense light.

“ I agree to the soul search… ”
“ I also agree! ” Before Man Cheng could speak, several people in the hall spoke quietly. These individuals held certain positions in the Wild City; their words clearly aimed to completely destroy Chu Chen.

Chu Chen’s face darkened, then his gaze showed disappointment as he looked at Man Cheng: “ Temple Lord, you also agree to the soul search? ”

“ This… ” Man Cheng’s face was uncertain. A soul search was the greatest humiliation for a person. The蛮族 people were fierce; Man Cheng saw Chu Chen’s fierce nature and knew that if it was truly done, it would make Chu Chen lose some sense of belonging to the蛮族. This wasn’t what Man Cheng wanted to see.

“ Boy, if you’re truly innocent, you won’t fear our soul search! ” Meng Yunlong smiled coldly, speaking to Chu Chen.

“ I found a strange person outside recently who could heal the prince of the蛮族! ” Chu Chen ignored Meng Yunlong’s words, looking at Man Cheng with a determined gaze.

Chapter 1674: The Arrival of the蛮魂 ()

“ What! ” Hearing Chu Chen’s words, Man Cheng’s face changed instantly. His eyes stared at Chu Chen with shock.

Recently, the prince of the蛮族 had returned from outside, and almost everyone in the蛮族 knew about it. But who would have thought that the prince had been asleep since his return, causing Saban and several reclusive old masters to be alarmed. Yet despite their efforts, there was no improvement. Then Saban issued a reward to find someone who could wake the prince.

Saban, the spiritual leader of the蛮族, held a high position in the蛮族. Even the former royal ancestor had no more prestige than Saban. If Saban valued something, it wasn’t trivial; the entire蛮族 had mobilized to find a way to heal the prince, but after so long, there was still no progress.

Now Chu Chen said this, making the people in the hall shocked. If Chu Chen had truly found such a person, no one in the蛮族 would dare to touch him. Even the Temple Lord of the Divine Temple, Man Cheng, couldn’t do anything.

“ Ha! Boy, what are you saying? You think we’re all doing nothing? ” Meng Yunlong sneered, thinking Chu Chen was desperate and making up a plan.

“ I’ll resist the soul search! ” Chu Chen coldly said, his voice full of disappointment as he looked at Man Cheng.

“ Start! ” Hearing Chu Chen’s words, Meng Yunlong’s face turned cold and he sent his spiritual sense out. He stepped toward Chu Chen, reaching for his head with a large hand.

Chu Chen’s face was cold; he stared at Meng Yunlong, but inside he smiled. After all, Luo Tian was still there; no one could do anything to his soul without Luo Tian. Perhaps they would end up in trouble instead.

“ Clang… ” Just as Meng Yunlong’s large hand was about to touch Chu Chen’s head, the hall’s door opened, and three tall figures appeared in people’s sight.

“ Very lively! ” A low voice echoed, and at the same time, an invisible pressure spread throughout the hall.

The powerful pressure made Meng Yunlong stop his actions and look at the newcomers, then his expression changed slightly, showing respect.

“ Greetings to the Temple Lord! ” The three newcomers smiled and bowed respectfully to Man Cheng, then looked at Meng Yunlong and Chu Chen.

“ Holy Prince, what brings you here? ” Man Cheng stood up with a smile. Though he was the Temple Lord of the Divine Temple, these three individuals were no less than him in status. The leader among them was even the Holy Prince of the蛮族, Man Hun.

Behind Man Hun were the second and third top talents of the蛮族, Man Long and Man Jiang.

Now, Man Hun had become a royal candidate; his aura was more stable, and his gaze carried authority.

“ You said you found someone who could heal the prince? ” Man Hun smiled slightly and looked at Chu Chen.

“ Yes! ” Chu Chen nodded, then said nothing more, looking at Man Hun. He hadn’t expected this matter would even draw the attention of Man Hun, who was so difficult to meet.

But Chu Chen felt contempt; Luo Tian had once fought against Man Hun and chased him away in a mess.

“ Temple Lord, this person must not be harmed! ” Hearing Chu Chen’s words, Man Hun nodded and spoke to Man Cheng with a respectful tone.

“ Yes, I think so too! ” Man Cheng nodded and then grabbed Meng Yunlong, scolding: “ Did I allow you to perform the soul search? ”

“ This… ” Meng Yunlong’s cold sweat flowed down, then he bowed and said: “ Temple Lord, Holy Prince, this person is clearly lying. It’s a delaying tactic; he’s just making it up! ”

“ Yes, the Holy Prince of the蛮族, this person didn’t admit it before but said it during the soul search. Clearly, he has something to hide and is trying to blackmail all of us! ”

“ If this person isn’t eliminated, it will surely anger our clan leader. Then we can’t bear the wrath! ” The two men from the Qilin and Fei clans said coldly, their threat implied.

“ Threatening me? ”

“ Get out… ”

“ The蛮族’s matters don’t need your interference. If you have any complaints, come to the蛮族 and talk to me! ” Man Hun’s face turned cold at their words. He waved his hand, and a powerful wave of energy surged toward the two men from the Qilin and Fei clans.

“ Bang… ” A moment later, a dull sound echoed; the two men from the clans and their chairs were smashed against the hall’s wall. Waves of energy rose on the wall, blocking their impact.

“ You… ” Both men were in Epoch late-stage; before Man Hun, they were like children. Their mouths bled.

“ Go! You should know your clan’s nature! ” Man Long looked at them with a serious face, showing disgust.

“ Alright! You won’t regret it! ” The two men looked at each other with resentment and then left the hall awkwardly. They knew Man Hun had spoken, so for now, this Chu Chen couldn’t be taken away.

“ He should die! ” Meng Yunlong cursed in his heart. Originally, he wanted to take this opportunity to kill Chu Chen, and it seemed almost successful. But Man Hun had arrived.

“ Alright, the matter is resolved. Now tell us where this strange person is. Can you bring him here? You know, if you can’t, it means what consequences! ” Man Hun looked at the two clan men leaving and then turned to Chu Chen, smiling.

“ Arrogant! You didn’t even beat him! ” Chu Chen felt contempt but kept a serious face.

“ I told him about the prince’s situation earlier. That strange person said he could come to the蛮族 in a month! ” Chu Chen followed Luo Tian’s instructions and spoke to Man Hun.

“ A month? ” Man Hun’s brow furrowed slightly, his eyes showing thoughtfulness before he nodded.

“ A month is a month; it’s not a big deal! ” Man Hun nodded and then spoke to Man Cheng.

“ Temple Lord, give him a month’s time. If he can’t bring the healer back in a month, whatever you do with him is your choice. I’m sorry for this, but the prince’s matter is important and mustn’t be hasty! ” Man Hun bowed to Man Cheng, then left the hall with Man Long and Man Jiang.

“ Huh… ” Chu Chen sighed deeply, but he was still nervous. He didn’t know where Luo Tian’s strange person was. If in a month he couldn’t find one, then he would still be dead.

“ Boy, you heard the Holy Prince’s words, right? A month later, if we find out you lied or just brought someone to trick us, even I can’t protect you. The Holy Prince has already offended two clans for your sake. If he really can’t find it, then he will be furious! ” Man Cheng’s eyes showed a smile and admiration. From start to finish, Chu Chen’s performance had impressed him, earning his approval.

“ Alright, everyone can leave! ” Man Cheng then slowly stood up and led the way out of the蛮族.

“ Boy, let you live for another month! You and your Shi clan want to return to the Wild City. First, ask us Meng clan if it’s okay. Think you can hide by changing your name? ” Meng Yunlong looked at Chu Chen with coldness, speaking to him.

Hearing Meng Yunlong’s words, Chu Chen’s body trembled slightly. He hadn’t expected to be discovered eventually.

“ It really is the remnants of the Shi clan! ” Meng Yunlong saw Chu Chen’s reaction and showed a hint of killing intent. He had only wanted to trick Chu Chen earlier but hadn’t expected it to actually work.

However, Meng Yunlong knew that with Man Hun and Man Cheng protecting him, he couldn’t touch Chu Chen. So he just looked at Chu Chen once and then followed the crowd out of the hall. In his mind, Chu Chen was clearly lying; no one in the nine realms could do what Saban couldn’t.

“ Foolish boy, you were tricked by him. He didn’t know you were from the Shi clan at all! ” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in Chu Chen’s mind, making his body tremble slightly.

“ But it doesn’t matter much. Once my strength recovers, I’ll destroy them! ” Luo Tian’s indifferent voice echoed in Chu Chen’s mind.

“ Go back, then. The rest is up to me! ” Then Luo Tian sent a mental message to Chu Chen, following him back to the Nanling territory.

“ Hum… ” Chu Chen waved his hand and sent Luo Tian out, looking at him with concern: “ Brother, maybe we should take the clan and flee! ”

“ Foolish boy, do you think you can escape? Not only Meng Yunlong but even the Holy Prince Man Hun won’t let you go. Believe me, if the Nanling clan moves in large numbers, strong people will come to kill you! ” Luo Tian smiled.

“ What should I do? In a month, where would I find someone to heal the prince! ” Chu Chen’s face was grim.

“ Don’t worry, everything is under control. I’ll just give the prince a few more acupuncture sessions; maybe he’ll recover! ” Luo Tian smiled and comforted Chu Chen, who was anxious.

Chapter 1675: Cultivation Recovery ()

“ Yes, Brother, take your time to recover. I also need to prepare; anyone who reaches the Epoch must undergo a test for the Divine Guard. If I can enter the Divine Guard, my status in the蛮族 will definitely change! ” Chu Chen nodded and then stepped out of Luo Tian’s room.

“ This is the ‘Seven Steps of the蛮’; practice it diligently, and it might be very useful to you! ” As Chu Chen stepped out, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his mind along with the incantation of ‘Seven Steps of the蛮’ and a series of influences.

“ Seven Steps of the蛮! ” Chu Chen’s body trembled slightly; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to know this technique. Though he knew Luo Tian was strong, he had no idea about his methods.

But Chu Chen said nothing more; some things didn’t need to be spoken, just remembered. The value of ‘Seven Steps of the蛮’ was obvious; only direct descendants of the蛮族 could learn it, like Man Long and Man Jiang.

For people like Chu Chen, entering the Divine Guard could only learn the first three steps of ‘Seven Steps of the蛮’; the later steps required extraordinary achievements to obtain.

“ A month! ” Luo Tian looked at Chu Chen’s figure disappearing and sat in his courtyard, muttering lowly. His eyes showed contemplation.

“ I don’t know if my cultivation will recover in a month. During this time, I can only try my best. If I really can’t recover, then I’ll have to go that way. It’s time to check on Chen Zhanbiao too; it’s been long enough! ”

“ Right now, my problem is withered meridians. I need some vitality and cultivation to revive them. If I can nourish the meridians with vitality and cultivation, they will recover quickly! ” Luo Tian muttered to himself. He hadn’t been idle these days, constantly thinking about his problem.

“ Elixirs won’t work; the effects are too strong. I should use medicine instead! Medicine is gentler! ” Luo Tian sighed deeply, not wanting to use needles on himself unless it was absolutely necessary.

“ But I can’t think of another way right now! ” Luo Tian then bit his teeth and took out the silver needles.

“ Ah… ” Then, the small courtyard with a house that seemed out of place compared to the vast蛮族 buildings began to echo with Luo Tian’s pitiful cries.
