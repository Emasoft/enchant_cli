"You can't escape!" As Luo Tian turned around, the Immortal King in the middle stage who had been chasing him appeared with a sinister expression. Behind him were several Immortal Kings in the early stage, all activating their martial techniques and charging toward Luo Tian with devastating blows.

"Sky is against me!" Luo Tian roared within his heart, the intense life-or-death crisis making his eyes flash with ruthless determination.

"Supplementing Heaven Stone! Help me!" Without hesitation, Luo Tian activated the artifact. The attacks from both sides were capable of annihilating him; if he could withstand them, he would be no ordinary man.

"Buzz..." In an instant, Luo Tian appeared on the crimson earth, dust swirling and settling onto the ground.

Boom...

As soon as Luo Tian materialized atop the Supplementing Heaven Stone, a thunderous explosion echoed in his ears. A violent surge of power struck Luo Tian standing on the crimson earth.

"Puke..." Luo Tian spat blood, his body now bearing cracks.

The power radiated in all directions, martial techniques exploding with fury. The area where Luo Tian stood was instantly reduced to nothingness.

The earth trembled, as if the end of the world had arrived. It lasted for a quarter of an hour before calming down, and people watched as the void slowly healed. A deep pit spanning several thousand zhang appeared.

"Surely, it's reduced to dust! His body and soul annihilated. The trouble of the Immortal Realm has finally been eliminated!" People exclaimed, rushing toward the pit.

Standing at the edge of the pit, they gazed into its bottomless depths, searching for the Ghost Valley Seal.

"Where is the Ghost Valley Seal? Our attacks were powerful, but they shouldn't have annihilated it entirely!" Everyone was puzzled.

As people pondered this, a streak of light suddenly rose from behind them, heading straight for the Eternity Mountain.

"He's not dead! That's Luo Tian!" As the streak of light appeared, people saw Luo Tian, his body drenched in blood.

"How is that possible? Is he even human?" Everyone gasped, watching Luo Tian charge toward the Eternity Mountain with disbelief.

"Master, I truly risked my life this time. Make sure to take care of me properly..." A weak voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind before fading away.

"Rest assured!" Luo Tian felt gratitude within his heart. If it weren't for the Supplementing Heaven Stone's protection, he would have been annihilated.

"Chase him!" People realized their mistake too late. Luo Tian had already vanished into the Eternity Mountain in an instant.

"You all wait! One day, I'll eradicate you!" Luo Tian's furious voice echoed from within the mountain.

As soon as Luo Tian's words faded, several figures appeared at the entrance of the Eternity Mountain—several peak-stage Immortal Kings.

"Entered the Eternity Mountain!" The Eternal King's face darkened as he gazed at the endless mountain.

"Chase him!" The Eternal King hesitated for a moment before rushing into the Eternity Mountain without hesitation.

"Has the Eternal King gone mad?" Seeing the Eternal King enter the Eternity Mountain, the others couldn't help but exclaim. They were now top-tier immortals in the Immortal Realm, yet they still feared the Eternity Mountain.

"Even if he enters, he won't find that boy's traces!" The Medicine King spoke, clearly having entered the Eternity Mountain before.

"Indeed. The Eternity Mountain seems to change constantly, leaving no traces!" The Soul King spoke, his voice heavy with concern.

As their words faded, a deafening explosion echoed through the endless mountains.

A streak of dark light rose and surged toward them from deep within the mountain. The dark light radiated supreme pressure, causing the peak-stage Immortal Kings to frown.

Within the streak of dark light stood a man, an old man with two wings—one white and one black.

Chapter 2430: Fallen Heaven Immortal King

Black and white wings flapped, radiating immense power. The old man's face was expressionless as he extended his hand, unleashing a vast surge of power that turned the heavens and earth crimson.

"Who is this!" The peak-stage Immortal Kings gazed in disbelief at the figure standing before them, even doubting their own eyes. This phenomenon hadn't occurred in a long time among these top-tier immortals.

"Fallen Heaven Immortal King!"

"How is that possible!" The Ghost King gasped, never expecting to encounter the image of a deceased person.

The others were equally shocked. The man before them had long been considered dead in their memories.

"Ah, he's entered the Eternity Mountain!" People's eyes showed reverence. They then turned their gaze toward the Eternal King.

The Eternity Mountain had been destroyed by the Eternal King years ago. Therefore, if the Fallen Heaven Immortal King was still alive, he would certainly seek revenge against the Eternal King.

"He's dead. His physical body is immortal, but it must be controlled by some terrifying force!" The Eternal King spoke. He had spent his life pursuing immortality and was well-versed in such matters.

"Legends say the Fallen Heaven Immortal King left a world-shattering inheritance. Is it hidden within the Eternity Mountain?" One person's face showed confusion before excitement. An inheritance left by a peak-stage Immortal King—who wouldn't desire it?

"Let's go. Once he enters the Eternity Mountain, that boy won't survive. Even if he does, he'll eventually come out!" The Eternal King spoke with a hint of amusement.

"Are you so certain?" The Medicine King asked, gazing at the Eternal King's confident expression.

"Sure," the Eternal King chuckled and took a step back, vanishing from sight.

"Those of the Eternal Mountain are forbidden to enter the Eternity Mountain!" As he vanished, the Eternal King's authoritative voice made those from the Eternal Mountain hesitate. Some among them had indeed wanted to enter the Eternity Mountain, hoping to find the Fallen Heaven Immortal King's inheritance.

"Let's go," the other peak-stage Immortal Kings also departed, leading their respective mountain forces.

"Is that all?" Some scattered cultivators stared at each other in disbelief, not expecting these top-tier immortals to simply abandon the matter.

"But it's true. That's the Fallen Heaven Immortal King, and this is the Eternity Mountain—peak-stage immortals are still wary of it!" Several people sighed.

"Should we dare to enter the Eternity Mountain?" Those who remained hesitated. The inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King was too tempting.

"Fortune favors the bold!" One person spoke and took a step toward the Eternity Mountain.

With one person leading, it ignited people's desires. One by one, scattered cultivators began to approach the Eternity Mountain.

...Luo Tian lay on the ground, gazing at the Fallen Heaven Immortal King in the sky. The latter had glanced toward him but hadn't attacked, so Luo Tian let out a long sigh of relief.

"He has no soul!" Luo Tian also noticed the Fallen Heaven Immortal King's issue and dared not act recklessly.

The black and white wings flapped, and the Fallen Heaven Immortal King vanished from Luo Tian's sight, leaving him with a bitter smile.

"You'd be better off alive!" Luo Tian whispered softly. If the Fallen Heaven Immortal King were truly alive, countless events would never have occurred.

"His injuries are severe. You old scoundrels will pay for this!" Luo Tian observed the surrounding terrain, feeling a powerful presence in this strange Eternity Mountain that pressed down on him.

"This is only the beginning of entering the Eternity Mountain?" Luo Tian felt puzzled and tense.

"What a strange place!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration. Though he felt the pressure, his current state was terrible; he could only choose to heal here.

"The power of the ninth-grade immortal pills is indeed astonishing. There's still medicinal energy left!" Luo Tian examined his injuries and found that the ninth-grade immortal pills' power was still present.

"Unfortunately, I used them all to escape. If I had fully cultivated them, I might have broken through to the middle stage of Immortal King!" Luo Tian sighed deeply.

The Mind-Devouring Grand Ritual activated, and Luo Tian began to cultivate the remaining medicinal energy, restoring his injuries. However, as soon as he started cultivating, his face darkened. He suddenly opened his eyes wide with shock.

"His injuries are healing too slowly!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. The brief cultivation of the medicinal energy had yielded no results.

"What kind of power is this!" Luo Tian's eyes showed bitterness. He communicated with the Supplementing Heaven Stone but found it unresponsive.

Luo Tian's heart finally grew anxious. His injuries were severe; if not for the Supplementing Heaven Stone's protection, he might have been annihilated by dozens of Immortal Kings.

"Think of a way!" Luo Tian slowly rose to his feet, though he was heavily wounded. He didn't give up but stood up gradually.

Luo Tian tried to fly, but the higher his cultivation level, the slower his energy flow. The entire Eternity Mountain made it impossible to fly unless one was a peak-stage Immortal King.

"Worldly forces are terrifying!" Luo Tian walked slowly through the forest, noticing that although the trees were lush, there was no living creature.

Soon, Luo Tian found a small stream. The sound of the flowing water brought a hint of joy to his face. He approached the stream, gazing at its clear waters.

"I..." Luo Tian's eyes flickered as he looked into the stream's reflection. His eyebrows furrowed slightly. At this moment, his appearance was ragged, bloodied and torn, but he felt that the reflection in the water looked different from before. He couldn't immediately tell what was different.

"Plip..." Luo Tian jumped into the stream, washing himself in the cold water. The icy water struck his body.

"This stream contains vitality!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, instantly sensing that his wounds were slowly healing under the water's influence.

"What is this stream? It can heal injuries!" Luo Tian was amazed. Although the healing process was slow, he could clearly feel his wounds recovering.

Seeing that it healed injuries, Luo Tian hesitated to leave the stream. He followed the flow of the water, not knowing where it led.

Time passed without measure. Finally, Luo Tian's injuries were completely healed, and his eyes showed joy.

"His physical body is about restored!" Luo Tian jumped out of the stream, changed into clean clothes, and gazed again at the small stream that flowed endlessly.

"I floated in it for three days before, yet I still hadn't reached the end. How vast is this Eternity Mountain!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at his reflection in the stream. His eyes showed disbelief.

"My appearance!" Luo Tian gasped, stepping back suddenly.

In the stream, his appearance was no longer youthful. His face had aged, and even some wrinkles had appeared, transforming him into a middle-aged man.

"Time power!"

"This is a death trap!" Luo Tian gasped, finally understanding the peculiarity of this forest.

"Unconsciously, it steals people's time!" Luo Tian felt anxious. Three days had turned him into a middle-aged man. If he stayed longer, would it turn him into an old man or even kill him here?

"It's because of this stream. This small stream is siphoning the time from the entire forest!" Luo Tian spoke softly, instantly understanding why his injuries had healed so quickly in the river.

"So the end of this stream is where life lies!" Luo Tian spoke softly, increasing his speed. He couldn't die in the Eternity Mountain.

Luo Tian moved like a nimble monkey, running toward the end of the stream. After three days of non-stop running, he still hadn't found an end, which made him anxious. He looked at his hair and saw some white strands.

"His energy is weak!" Luo Tian was extremely anxious, but he only knew that the end of the stream was a chance for survival.

After flying for half a day, Luo Tian saw someone. Accurately speaking, it was an old man, the same as him, walking along the stream. However, the old man's condition was worse than Luo Tian's.

"Hey..." Luo Tian quickly caught up with the old man and called out to him, causing the old man to slowly turn around.

"Luo Tian!" The old man turned and saw Luo Tian, looking surprised. Then he noticed the "Ghost Valley" characters on Luo Tian's back and his face slightly changed.

Chapter 2431: Catch a Fish

The old man hadn't expected to meet Luo Tian here, his eyes showing disbelief. However, he quickly became cautious toward Luo Tian.

"Know me?" Luo Tian's face darkened instantly. Those who could recognize him were either the ones who had previously chased and killed him or no one else.

But Luo Tian hadn't taken the time to remember their appearances, as he had been focused on escaping and there were too many people chasing him.

"Kill..." Realizing the truth, Luo Tian didn't hesitate and rushed toward the old man.

"You..." The old man's face changed in panic. His current condition was extremely poor, as this place siphoned vitality; he was almost at his end.

To the old man, it was nearly instantaneous. Luo Tian had already taken a few steps and immediately punched toward the old man.

"Crack..." A crisp sound echoed. The old man also swung a punch, but the sound of cracking was heard. His aged body kept retreating.

"Luo Tian, let's talk calmly. Our main goal is to get out of here, right?" The old man spoke through blood, his pale face becoming even more gaunt.

"Back then when you killed me, why didn't you talk calmly! First kill him and get some interest!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, taking another step forward. His heart had been filled with anger and now it burst out.

"Boom... Boom..." Three punches landed, instantly eliminating the old man. Luo Tian took a deep breath.

"It's no good. He was right, we need to get out of here. If I walk alone, it might take forever!" Luo Tian muttered softly, gazing at the endless stream. The brief confrontation had made him tired. He could sense that he had lost a lot of time here, and his cultivation was suppressed; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to eliminate the old man with three punches.

"If I stay too long, I'll become a commoner, like that old man. How can I get out?" Luo Tian felt puzzled but didn't waste time. He walked on foot, thinking about how to escape this death trap.

"Indeed, the Eternity Mountain is terrifying. Once you enter, it can kill me. No wonder even peak-stage immortal kings fear this place!" Luo Tian muttered to himself.

While walking through the Eternity Mountain, a figure arrived at its entrance. The man wore white robes that fluttered in the wind, his face cold and expressionless as he landed at the Eternity Mountain's entrance.

At this moment, there were no people left outside the Eternity Mountain. The appearance of the white-cloaked man went unnoticed.

"Little Tian, this time I'm with you!" The white-cloaked man spoke, his voice resolute. Zhang Ziping was the one who had arrived—Luo Tian's elder brother, Zhang Ziping. Previously, the Supplementing Heaven Immortal King had found Zhang Ziping and sent Luo Tian to the Supplementing Heaven Mountain.

But when Luo Tian arrived, he was immediately taken by the Supplementing Heaven Immortal King and didn't meet Zhang Ziping. Zhang Ziping and others hadn't known Luo Tian's condition, and they had been very worried.

Afterward, news of Luo Tian entering the Eternity Mountain spread. The forces from several immortal mountains had left.

Zhang Ziping didn't stop, finishing his tasks and secretly leaving without telling Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Xuan Dan. He arrived at the Eternity Mountain.

"Only the Eternity Mountain!" Zhang Ziping shook his head lightly, took flight without hesitation, and rushed into the Eternity Mountain. However, Luo Tian didn't know Zhang Ziping had arrived and continued walking along the stream. The longer he stayed, the more he felt his weakness.

"Don't move; if I do, it'll consume me!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, his face already lined with wrinkles.

"Stream?" He then gazed at the flowing stream, thinking deeply.

"Although this stream siphons time power, I noticed that the rate of my aging was much slower outside!" Luo Tian quickly realized the issue and jumped back into the stream, letting it carry his body along.

The Eternity Mountain was shrouded in mist. If someone could view it from above, they would see that there were eight streams like Luo Tian's, converging at one point. This was only part of the Eternity Mountain; to reach its depths, they still had a long way to go. These eight streams each had people in them—clearly, after entering the Eternity Mountain, these people hadn't gathered together or had been separated due to the changing terrain.

"Ripple... Ripple..." Luo Tian lay on the water's surface, listening to the surrounding sounds of flowing water. His heart was unusually calm despite his aging. This was a state he could only feel when nearing death.

However, the sound of rolling waves broke Luo Tian's calmness, making him cautious. A sense of danger infiltrated his mind, and he raised his spirit.

In the clear stream, a black figure swam upstream toward Luo Tian. Luo Tian could only see it vaguely; it looked like a fish, but its body was much larger than usual—about ten zhang long.

Luo Tian became cautious. His current state was definitely not suitable for a fight, so he slowly swam toward the shore.

"Ripple... Ripple..."

But the fish's speed was astonishingly fast. In a moment, it reached Luo Tian's side, allowing him to see the fish's true form. It was a three-eyed dragon-fish with green scales radiating vitality. Most noticeable were the three green eyes on its head, glowing with a mysterious green light.

"Three-eyed Dragon-Fish!" Luo Tian gasped, recalling the records in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. He extended his fist toward the approaching three-eyed dragon-fish.

"Roar..." The three-eyed dragon-fish let out a roar, and its massive head collided with Luo Tian's fist.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian felt his fist had hit an iron plate, as if his bones were about to crack.

"This body is really no good!" Luo Tian sighed in self-mockery, watching the three-eyed dragon-fish he had knocked back.

"Ripple... Ripple..." The water surged, and the green fish tail also swung toward Luo Tian.

"Ungrateful! Beast Sealing Seal!" Luo Tian had thought this creature would learn a lesson after taking his punch, but it still wanted to attack him.

"Buzz..." A green Beast Sealing Seal appeared above Luo Tian's head. He didn't want to waste energy or time on this three-eyed dragon-fish, as it was a waste of life.

The three-eyed dragon-fish was fierce and cruel but lacked intelligence, appearing terrifying only. If it encountered an Immortal King, it would be crushed immediately.

Luo Tian's current state was poor. If he were at his peak, he could eliminate as many three-eyed dragon-fishes as he wanted.

The Beast Sealing Seal's aura spread, instantly making the three-eyed dragon-fish stop. Its three green eyes showed fear as it gazed at the Beast Sealing Seal.

Luo Tian extended his hand and pointed, sending green runes onto the three-eyed dragon-fish's head. The three eyes also changed.

"Kill you! It's a pity!" Luo Tian took down the Long Yuan Sword, intending to end this fish. However, just as he was about to strike, a sudden idea struck him. He took a step back and lay on the three-eyed dragon-fish's massive body.

"Go, take me to the end of this stream!" Luo Tian communicated with the dragon-fish, and it carried him forward.

"Ripple... Ripple..." The massive body rushed like an arrow toward the stream's end.

"This is so comfortable!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly. His hair was already completely white, and he could feel his cultivation had nearly stopped. The punch against the three-eyed dragon-fish had cost him a lot.

Time passed slowly, and the three-eyed dragon-fish's speed was astonishing. After one and a half days, Luo Tian finally saw the end of the stream—a dark cave-like structure. At this moment, Luo Tian was already old and weak, his eyebrows white with age, and his face lined with wrinkles.

"Roar..." The three-eyed dragon-fish also felt Luo Tian's state and roared, carrying him into the dark cave.

...Drip... Drip...

The sound of dripping water echoed continuously. Luo Tian's old eyes were hazy, gazing at the surrounding dark rocks as water vapor condensed and dripped.

"I can barely stand anymore!" Luo Tian sighed in self-mockery, feeling his physical functions gradually withering.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian felt the sound of flowing water gradually calming, and the three-eyed dragon-fish no longer moved straight ahead.

"Right! Why isn't this three-eyed dragon-fish affected by the time-siphoning power?" Luo Tian suddenly realized.

As he understood, a streak of light caught his attention. The three-eyed dragon-fish stopped and roared at Luo Tian.

No need for the three-eyed dragon-fish to remind him, Luo Tian climbed up and saw the streaks of light. His eyes immediately showed joy, his aged face wrinkled with excitement.

A tree several zhang high was rooted in a black rock, and water flowed beneath it. Waves of energy radiated from the green tree, most notably its golden fruits that exuded a fragrant vitality and spread it around.

"This is a fully grown Immortal Herb!"

"Something's wrong. Even an immortal herb wouldn't have such a strong energy wave!" Luo Tian was puzzled, but he didn't care anymore. He walked toward the tree from the three-eyed dragon-fish's back, struggling to move forward.

Only a hundred zhang away, Luo Tian took an hour to walk. As he moved, he swayed unsteadily.

"Got it!" Luo Tian extended his hand and grabbed a golden fruit, his eyes filled with excitement.

Chapter 2432: Time Tree

The golden fruit exuded a rich fragrance. Without hesitation, Luo Tian bit into it.

A sweet sensation immediately echoed in his teeth, and a powerful vitality spread throughout Luo Tian's body, as if injecting a refreshing current into his withered body.

"Buzz..." A divine light flowed. Luo Tian's eyes showed disbelief, feeling his physical body nourished by a powerful force.

"It works!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate and swallowed the entire fruit. His white hair and wrinkles gradually turned black and smoothed out, making him feel very comfortable. He felt that the lost years had returned significantly.

"Another one! I should return to my previous state!" Luo Tian extended his hand and grabbed another fruit, devouring it. As he swallowed the second fruit, waves of energy radiated from his body, and his physical functions were fully restored.

"Finally recovered!" Luo Tian muttered softly, gazing at his hands with admiration.

"Two fruits could restore an Immortal King to youth. How terrifying must the time power be!" Luo Tian gazed at the remaining six fruits on the tree.

Luo Tian had eaten the two closest to him, while the others were at different heights.

"This is a Time Tree! My god, no wonder it siphoned my years!" As Luo Tian prepared to take the remaining fruits, a surprised voice echoed behind him.

The voice lacked vitality, obviously having gone through the same experience as Luo Tian. This made Luo Tian turn around. Another old man had appeared, and he wasn't surprised at all. Those who found this place were almost always old men; they had definitely lost a lot of vitality before finding it, and surviving here was already difficult.

Seeing Luo Tian, the old man's eyes narrowed slightly. The "Ghost Valley" characters on Luo Tian's back were too obvious for anyone to miss.

"Do you know me?" Luo Tian smiled and spoke to the old man, taking advantage of the moment before the old man reached the shore. He extended his hand and grabbed all six remaining fruits.

"You..."

"You don't know me!" The old man spoke, his voice filled with bitterness. How could he not recognize Luo Tian? He had also participated in killing Luo Tian before, but now his current state made him no match for Luo Tian.

"Do you think I believe that?" Luo Tian's face showed a sneer. He grabbed the old man and restrained him.

"Tell me, how do you want to die? Killing me must have been pleasant before. You never thought it would be your turn, did you?" Luo Tian's face showed disdain. The old man's expression had already revealed his thoughts.

"It was a misunderstanding. We couldn't help but follow the orders of peak-stage Immortal Kings!"

"If you give me one Time Fruit, I can submit to you!" The old man spoke. He had once been an Immortal King; he was still valuable to Luo Tian.

"Do you think I need that?" Luo Tian sneered. His mind was active, realizing that having another Immortal King here would be a capital asset.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the old man trembled. He looked at Luo Tian and was surprised to find that he had sold himself out, yet Luo Tian hadn't given him a chance at life.

"However, since you said that, I can give you an opportunity!" Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile. He looked at the old man.

"This fruit is for you!" Luo Tian extended his hand and used the Dao Heart Sealing Magic, imprinting it on the old man. The old man didn't resist but allowed Luo Tian to place a restriction on him. At this moment, as long as he was alive, even if it were excrement, he would eat it.

Luo Tian felt a bit of regret as he handed the Time Fruit to the old man. He only had six in total, and he could imagine how rare this fruit was—how much time power must have been extracted to produce these eight.

This was only possible in the Eternity Mountain. If it were outside, it would surely cause a competition among peak-stage Immortal Kings. This was an immortal herb that could extend one's life.

The old man quickly swallowed it, fearing Luo Tian would change his mind. His aura gradually rose, and his withered face slowly recovered.

"I can only give you one. This thing is rare; each fruit reduces the number by one. The remaining years, you'll have to find your own way out. I assume an Immortal King like you can manage, provided we have a chance to escape!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the underground river. This Time Tree wasn't in the deepest part.

A dark cave appeared before Luo Tian and the old man. The old man had recovered slightly, though still aged, but it didn't matter much.

"Master, my name is Tang Xinghuo. I am a scattered cultivator!" The old man, now with the Dao Heart Sealing Magic imprinted on him, spoke respectfully.

"Ah!" Luo Tian nodded. He hadn't expected Tang Xinghuo to be so respectful.

In fact, Tang Xinghuo had no strong resistance. First, Luo Tian had placed a restriction on him, and he could feel the restriction's power, which could strip away all his abilities. Second, Luo Tian was a disciple of the Ghost Valley. Though he thought Luo Tian would die and be helpless in the Immortal Realm, if he truly didn't die, his future achievements would certainly not be small. At that time, Tang Xinghuo would gain a lot.

Scattered cultivators were usually unwilling to be bound, so Tang Xinghuo hadn't joined the nine immortal mountains. A big reason was his personality; he wasn't integrated into them, but this was different with Luo Tian. Luo Tian hadn't fully risen yet.

"Wait and see if anyone else comes!" Luo Tian gazed at the Time Tree, sat cross-legged, and began to cultivate.

Tang Xinghuo said nothing but also sat under the Time Tree, hoping to recover some of his years.

The cave became quiet. Only the sound of the three-eyed dragon-fish swimming and moving water could be heard.

Time power...

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. Suddenly, he thought of something and extended his hand to take out a seed.

"Can this seed grow under these conditions?" Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly, placing the seed on the rock beneath him.

"Everything is born!" Luo Tian extended his hand and activated the "All Things Born" technique, converting his cultivation into vitality to stimulate it.

As Luo Tian stimulated the seed, golden light radiated from it. The seed that had previously failed to sprout now changed. Luo Tian could clearly feel a pulling force from the golden seed.

"Crack..." A sprout slowly appeared. The golden seed turned over, and the sprout pierced through the black rock, taking root.

"Indeed!" Luo Tian's eyes showed joy. He had Tang Xinghuo guard while he focused on stimulating the immortal herb's seed.

"Ripple... Ripple..." As Luo Tian stimulated the immortal herb's seed, the massive Time Tree emitted a series of humming sounds. Beneath the rock, thick roots extended toward the seed planted on the ground.

"Want to stop it?" Luo Tian's spiritual awareness observed everything. He immediately felt the Time Tree's strange behavior and his eyes flickered slightly.

"Stop!" His spiritual awareness extended, becoming tangible as it blocked the roots.

The roots stopped, but Luo Tian felt strained. His spiritual awareness was simultaneously stimulating the immortal herb's seed and resisting the Time Tree's interference. Even with his strong spiritual awareness, it was exhausting.

Crackling sounds continued as Luo Tian blocked the Time Tree's interference. The golden seed kept absorbing time power, taking root and growing rapidly.

"Ripple... Ripple..." The Time Tree violently shook, causing a storm to sweep toward Luo Tian.

"What's happening? It seems the Time Tree has sensed the threat and is attacking us!" Tang Xinghuo's face showed shock. He hadn't expected the Time Tree to change like this.

"Xinghuo, guard!" Luo Tian called out to Tang Xinghuo. The Time Tree had sensed the threat and was retaliating.

"Okay!" Tang Xinghuo wouldn't defy Luo Tian's will. He stood in front of Luo Tian, his hands moving and summoning a flame that quickly turned into a fire hand. The fire hand surged toward the storm.

The fire, aided by the wind, exploded and expanded, colliding with the storm. The cave trembled as green fire spread.

"Buzz..." After Tang Xinghuo blocked the storm, the Time Tree attacked again. Its thick branches extended and swept toward Luo Tian and Tang Xinghuo.

"This tree is sentient!" Tang Xinghuo's face showed a bitter smile. He extended his hand and struck the thick branch.

"Crack..." The branch cracked, and the green branch was directly broken by Tang Xinghuo's strike. However, his body was also thrown back, with blood spilling from his mouth.

As the entire Time Tree trembled, the water beneath the rock stirred and formed into several water dragons that roared toward Luo Tian and Tang Xinghuo.

"Almost as if it's sentient!" Luo Tian's mouth twitched. At this moment, the immortal herb he had cultivated was already over an inch tall and radiated a divine light.

"Almost enough. I can't hold on anymore!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, took out the Long Yuan Sword, and sliced downward at the rock. He cut a hundred zhang of rock and took the immortal herb with him.

Boom... Boom...
