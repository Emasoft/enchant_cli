Flames devoured the sky, their extreme heat twisting the black heavens. The formidable transmutation power left even the True Immortals accompanying Ye Liangchen awestruck.

"This flame isn't ordinary—its power must be several times greater than common heavenly fire!" a True Immortal remarked, his eyes gleaming with admiration.

A harrowing scream echoed within the seven-colored flame prison, as if a thousand vengeful spirits howled. Black mist dissolved into wisps of blue smoke beneath the radiant flames.

"One breath... two breaths..." After ten heartbeats, the black mist vanished completely, leaving a verdant fog to shroud the entire expanse. Visibility within the Endtimes Forest was lost.

"Let's go!" Luotian snorted, his body flickering as he surged toward the vast Endtimes Forest.

"Show-off! If you dare, come out and fight me directly, Young Master Ye! I have a hundred methods to kill you!" Ye Liangchen's eyes burned with excitement, following Luotian.

"Master, be cautious—this Endtimes Forest reeks of malevolence!" Seeing Ye Liangchen charge recklessly, the True Immortals immediately moved.

"Retreat!" Long Li, Sun Luoshan, and Zhang Fangfeng saw Luotian's group enter the Endtimes Forest. Observing the howling moon wolves surrounding them, they swiftly organized the five cities' people to evacuate.

"It should be enough... but we still need some time," a black-cloaked figure stood at the forest's heart, his body radiating intricate seals that spread outward.

The faceless man had no features—his entire visage was black. A blind old man stood before him, his eyes vacant.

Pulsing black mist erupted from the faceless man again, spreading outward to engulf the Endtimes Forest. Black light surged upward into the dark clouds above, while waves of black mist descended, filling the forest.

"What's happening!" At the moment the black fog descended, Luotian and his group felt their bodies suddenly sink under an irresistible aura. This force crushed them from the sky, landing them within the Endtimes Forest.

"What's going on? Once we entered the forest, it returned to normal!" Luotian questioned, realizing the oppressive aura vanished upon entry.

"Does he not want us to fly?" The True Immortals wore solemn expressions; that aura had been unmatchable, even for them. Clearly, the Endtimes Forest's danger could threaten them all.

All focused their attention on Luotian, who was more familiar with the Endtimes Forest.

Guiding them, Luotian extended his spiritual awareness to its peak—but could only sense two hundred feet ahead. His spiritual perception was suppressed.

Luotian remained cautious, not daring to increase speed. He advanced step by step into the Endtimes Forest.

Time passed slowly. Under Luotian's guidance, they journeyed nearly an hour through the Endtimes Forest but found no anomalies. Towering trees surrounded them, all cloaked in black mist.

"Something's wrong..." Luotian halted abruptly, gazing at a nearby ancient tree before approaching it.

"What's wrong?" Hearing Luotian's words, Ye Liangchen and the others grew solemn, their gazes turning to him.

"This tree—we've seen it before!" Luotian touched the knots on the ancient tree, his brows furrowing.

"I felt it too; the place I passed earlier felt familiar," Ye Liangchen murmured, his gaze drifting into the dark forest.

"An illusionary array!" They all spoke simultaneously, exchanging glances that revealed mutual concern.

Chapter 1918: Knowing Each Other

"An illusionary array!" Their expressions darkened; none among them understood arrays.

"We'll try again—this time, we'll leave a mark!" Luotian spoke gravely, drawing his Split Sky Spear and carving an imprint onto the ancient tree.

"This is all we can do; if we cannot break the array, we might be trapped here forever!" A True Immortal remarked, deepening their unease.

Array arts were endlessly variable; a skilled array master could even surpass their rank with enough time. Like the past, Wan Lingkong had set up several arrays that combined with Luotian's group to eliminate over a dozen True Immortals.

Among arrays, illusionary ones were the most challenging to break—some natural formations were inherently such. If one unknowingly stepped into a naturally formed illusionary array, they could be trapped indefinitely; natural arrays were more elusive and untraceable than man-made ones.

"Fortune favors us—this is likely a human-crafted illusionary array! I hope the master's skill isn't too high!" Luotian mentally reassured himself, praying fervently. He marked each tree with symbols every few steps.

Time passed slowly; half an hour had elapsed when Luotian and the others saw a mark on an ancient tree. Their faces darkened.

"I've wasted half an hour!" Luotian halted, gazing at the others.

"Don't move—there's no point; this array is unusual. We must find a way to break it!" The others also stopped, their expressions grim.

"How do we break it? Illusionary arrays can't be forced through; if we use martial arts to push forward, the Endtimes Forest's vastness would drain us!" A True Immortal sighed.

Silence fell as they pondered how to escape this predicament. If they couldn't break the array, they would be at its mercy.

"Flight! He doesn't want us to fly—evidently, no array exists in the sky!" Ye Liangchen glanced at the mist-veiled heavens.

"Exactly! To break the array, reaching the sky is the best approach!" Upon hearing Ye Liangchen's words, their eyes brightened.

Luotian eyed Ye Liangchen with suspicion; such a quick insight was beyond a mere aristocrat.

"Haha! I truly am a genius—this method is unprecedented!" Ye Liangchen laughed, his demeanor carefree.

"But how do we escape? Didn't you forget how we came down?" A Star River Estate aristocrat spoke up, instantly deflating Ye Liangchen's smugness.

"Let's try..." Luotian retrieved his Hunting Sun Bow, golden arrows凝聚ing as he drew the bow. The arrow shot skyward.

"Buzz..." The golden arrow surged forward with unyielding momentum, exiting the Endtimes Forest. However, upon entering the mist, its speed slowed until it halted, exploding like a fireworks display.

"Impossible..." Luotian shook his head, confident that arrow had enough power to wound a Heaven-Transcendent peak.

"If Wan Lingkong were here, this would be easier!" Luotian sighed deeply.

"First, meet up with Long Youran. Perhaps they weren't trapped by the array!" The usually silent Diao Dezhu spoke up.

"Did you have a plan?" Luotian's eyes lit up; Diao Dezhu, though prone to posturing, often devised clever solutions. Even Sun Kenuan, a shrewd man, had once fallen for Diao Dezhu's tricks.

"Did I say I did?"

"You forgot my specialty! You forget how I found your Chen Yunting's reincarnation!" Diao Dezhu's eyes gleamed with pride.

"Ah, I forgot your nose!" Luotian's eyes brightened, recalling Diao Dezhu's uncanny sense of smell.

"Shut up... you're the one with a dog's nose!" Diao Dezhu frowned, arguing.

"Stop talking—set up the array! The one who set this trap must have a purpose!" Luotian drew his sword, the same one Long Youran had used.

Diao Dezhu sniffed, then closed his eyes, extending a claw toward a direction.

"Go..." Luotian didn't hesitate, following Diao Dezhu's指引 into the mist again.

After an hour of flight, Ye Liangchen and the others were awestruck—they hadn't found any ancient trees with their earlier marks.

"This beast isn't simple; its keen sense of smell allows it to find others just by sniffing used items!"

"Ghost-Sensing Eagle!" The True Immortals accompanying Ye Liangchen gazed with envy at Luotian, who had continually surprised them.

Yet their envy was merely that—perhaps in the past they would have coveted it, but now knowing Luotian housed a terrifying sparrow within his body, they dared not harbor ill intentions.

"Almost there—less than a thousand feet!" After another half-hour, Diao Dezhu perched on Luotian's shoulder, his eyes glowing with intensity.

Hearing Diao Dezhu's words, their hearts lifted again; they couldn't be sure if finding Long Youran would lead them out of the array.

"A battle's energy!" Luotian frowned, sensing waves and clashing weapons.

In an instant, they arrived at the scene, discovering combatants. Luotian's eyes flashed with coldness.

Before them lay corpses scattered on the ground, thirty figures surrounding a group clad in Tianmen Sect robes.

The leader was Long Youran, his eyes cold, holding a black sword radiating sinister energy—undoubtedly no ordinary weapon.

Yet Long Youran's group was in dire straits, wounded and gasping for breath after each attack.

"Long Youran, hand over the sword, and we'll spare your lives!" A youth spoke, his arm dangling, face twisted with menace.

"Delusions! If we hand it over, will you let us live? Do you think us fools? If we do, you'll surely kill us!" Long Youran wielded the black sword, slicing at the youth's shoulder.

"Spurt..." Blood erupted from the severed arm, and Long Youran was pierced through the shoulder, blood spilling from her mouth.

"We are Tianmen Sect disciples! How dare you kill us!" Long Youran's companions shouted, having originally ten members but now reduced to five, battered and near death.

"Haha! The Immortal Realm is a battlefield of mutual strife; killing for treasure is common. Especially in the Endtimes Forest, where the heavens are distant—what do we fear?" The twenty-odd assailants spoke loudly.

Yet the remaining twenty-odd men were cautious, having followed Long Youran into the Endtimes Forest with over a hundred people—now only thirty remained.

"Want my life? Come and get it!" Long Youran's face was resolute, her black sword dripping blood.

"Enough! Let's strike together and destroy them!" The thirty figures retreated slightly before a voice called out.

"Buzz..." Instantly, the thirty launched their martial arts—sword qi and blade qi surged upward before being unleashed toward Long Youran's group.

At that moment, Luotian and the others arrived near Long Youran, their eyes blazing with killing intent. They stomped the ground, thundering toward her direction.

Ye Liangchen's face lit up at seeing Long Youran, his body vanishing from the spot as he rushed toward her alongside Luotian.

"Get out of my way!" Luotian snarled, shattering the thirty True Immortals' combined attack before standing before Long Youran.

Ye Liangchen's eyes showed frustration, joining Luotian with a cold expression.

"Lu Xiong, give me a chance to show off!" Ye Liangchen winked at Luotian, his voice echoing in his mind.

"Fine!" Luotian frowned, unsure of Ye Liangchen's plan but nodding anyway. Though Ye Liangchen was an aristocrat, his strength far surpassed these True Immortals.

"Comrades, follow me and kill these dogs! I hate those who attack women!" Ye Liangchen shouted, charging at several aristocrats.

"Got it!" The dozen aristocrats readily complied, rushing toward the stunned twenty True Immortals like tigers.

"Lu Tian Ge..." Long Youran, pale-faced, gazed at Luotian with disbelief.

"Lu Tian Xiong!" Others' faces showed joy, their eyes filled with excitement.

"You're safe now," Luotian gently lifted Long Youran, who was about to fall, and gave her a pill.

"Lu Tian Ge, why are you here?" Long Youran rubbed her eyes, lying in Luotian's arms.

"To save you! Foolish girl!" Luotian smiled, then glanced at Ye Liangchen's group. Their battle was nearing its end, a complete碾压 without悬念.

"That one didn't hold back..." Luotian observed Ye Liangchen's expression, setting Long Youran down.

"This is my sister, Long Youran!" Still, Luotian introduced her.

"Little sister? Haha! I'm Ye Liangchen from Star River Estate, my father is the estate's master, Ye Wudao... I..."

"Stop!" Hearing Ye Liangchen's words, Luotian interrupted immediately, his expression one of无奈. This was the countless times he'd heard this speech.

"Ha!" The dozen aristocrats and six Star River Estate True Immortals wore smug expressions; they'd heard this countless times, even thousands or tens of thousands. They were exhausted from it.

"Hey, Lu Tian Ge, let's talk privately!" Ye Liangchen pulled Luotian aside, whispering.

"Lu Tian Ge, do you have feelings for this little sister?" Ye Liangchen's face showed embarrassment for the first time, making Luotian widen his eyes.

This was the first time he'd seen Ye Liangchen with such a look; he hadn't expected this boastful Ye Liangchen to show such a face.

"No, I see her as my sister!" Luotian shook his head, glancing at Long Youran.

"Haha! That's good!"

"I won't lie, do you believe in love at first sight? The moment I saw this little sister, her aura captivated me. Lu Tian Ge, help me!" Ye Liangchen's tension vanished upon hearing Luotian's words.

"What?"

"Go to hell, don't mess with my sister!" Luotian had felt Ye Liangchen's oddness before, but upon hearing this direct statement, he was unwilling.

"Lu Tian Ge, I swear I'll treat her well! Trust me!" Ye Liangchen transmitted his thoughts to Luotian, but his voice was unusually loud.

"Lu Tian Ge, I'm serious!"

"No..."

"Lu Tian Ge, you're my brother..." Ye Liangchen and Luotian continued their exchange. No matter how Ye Liangchen spoke, Luotian refused to agree.

"Let's set this aside for now; first, we need to escape the Endtimes Forest!"

"Regarding Long Youran's marriage, I won't interfere too much. But it's not a game; she needs someone who truly cares for her, not a playboy! And Long Youran's father must agree!" Luotian shook his head, no longer paying attention to Ye Liangchen, walking toward the group.

"Long Youran, what happened these past days?" Luotian gazed around; the black mist still thickened. He knew they were still trapped within the array.

"Nothing much—after flying into the Endtimes Forest, we found no beasts and landed to search for Zheng Bo. But we couldn't find him, only discovered this black sword. I took it, and they became jealous, wanting to steal the treasure. They attacked us here!" Long Youran spoke softly, recounting their journey in the Endtimes Forest.

Later, as Luotian's group entered, an array formed. Long Youran's group dared not move and chose to fight those who pursued them.

"Hmm," Luotian nodded, then set fire to the corpses, his eyes flashing with cruelty.

"There's no other choice—only burning the Endtimes Forest!" Luotian sighed, gazing at the seven-colored flames.

"That's too harsh! Who knows how many creatures and beasts live here? If we burn it all, wouldn't that be a sin?" Upon hearing Luotian's words, the group's faces shifted slightly.

"No, I feel this forest has become a dead zone—no life except ancient trees!" Luotian replied.

"What's this? We didn't notice it before?" As the ashes drifted with the wind, revealing the ground, someone spoke up, pointing at it.

"Seals?" They soon noticed flowing black seals on the ground, their eyes flickering slightly.

"Perhaps if we follow these seals, we can escape!" Luotian's gaze was solemn; his bad feeling intensified.

"We can't leave—Star River Estate hasn't been found yet! We mustn't depart recklessly!" A few Star River Estate True Immortals refused immediately.

"Hmm... then head in the opposite direction of the energy waves—maybe reach the center!" Luotian felt regret, regretting having discovered Star River Estate in the Endtimes Forest's center.

"Lead the way!" The six True Immortals spoke to Luotian, knowing he carried that terrifying sparrow and thus no danger.

"Damn..." Luotian understood their intent, cursing inwardly. This sparrow grandfather didn't listen to him; it was eccentric. Who knew if this master would abandon him when in danger?

"Can one of you elders accompany Long Youran and the others to go the opposite direction? They're just a burden!" Luotian addressed the six True Immortals.

"No! This place is dangerous; we have a duty to protect the Young Master. Losing one person reduces our strength!" The six True Immortals refused immediately.

"No what no? Master Zhao and Elder Liu, you two take them to the opposite direction! Prevent us from going wrong!" Before Luotian could speak, Ye Liangchen directly ordered, gazing at Long Youran.

"This..."

"Don't be so sentimental! If you go, do it! The Young Master's talent is extraordinary and strong; he'll be fine!" Ye Liangchen boasted again, confident. He believed a confident man was most attractive to women.

He also secretly glanced at Long Youran, noticing she was watching him, and puffed out his chest again.

"Fine, the Young Master's orders—no choice but to obey!" The two elders nodded, giving instructions before leading Long Youran and the Tianmen Sect members, along with several aristocrats, in the opposite direction.

"Don't be disrespectful to Long Youran! Got it? If anyone is disrespectful, I'll deal with you when I return!" Seeing them leave, Ye Liangchen feared the two True Immortals and aristocrats might look down on Long Youran, so he reiterated.

"Rest assured, Ye Liangchen! We understand!" The aristocrats immediately understood his meaning, winking at him with a 'I get it' expression before vanishing from Luotian's group.

"Let's go!" Luotian stepped forward, heading in another direction. A sudden sense of urgency arose in his heart, especially seeing the dense black seals beneath him, sensing their eerie nature.

Time passed slowly; two hours had elapsed when Long Youran's group finally exited the Endtimes Forest.

As they stepped out, they saw the black seals' serpents also reaching the forest's edge.

As Luotian and his group exited the mist, they finally broke through the array, reaching the Endtimes Forest's central area. They saw a faceless man cloaked in black seals.

"You've come!" A cold voice echoed from the faceless man, causing Luotian's group to startle.

"Faceless Ghost!" Seeing the faceless man, Ye Liangchen and the remaining four True Immortals turned pale.

"How is this possible? How could a Faceless Ghost appear here!" The four True Immortals spoke simultaneously, their voices filled with disbelief.

"Faceless!" Within the Beast-Controlling Seal, the sparrow also slowly opened its eyes, revealing surprise.

"Faceless Ghost!" Luotian's eyes flickered slightly, his body tensing. He had studied the "Book of Mountains and Seas" on ghosts, knowing Faceless Ghosts were high-level entities.

"Nine Xuan Ghost Gate—Departure!" A cold voice echoed through the Endtimes Forest, also reaching Luotian's ears.

"What is the Nine Xuan Ghost Gate?" Luotian wondered, but Ye Liangchen and the four True Immortals turned pale.

"Buzz..." As Luotian pondered, a buzzing sound echoed. The black seals on the ground began to move.

"Boom..." As the seal serpents moved, the ground beneath them trembled violently. The dark clouds above swirled fiercely, with howls echoing from within.

"Crack..." Next, the ground beneath them seemed to collapse, sinking heavily. The entire Endtimes Forest appeared to enter an apocalypse; ancient trees fell and crashed onto the ground, black fissures emitting dark mist.

"Unexpectedly, the Departure of Nine Xuan Ghost Gate is here!" The sparrow murmured within the Beast-Controlling Seal, its eyes glowing.

"Stop him!" Seeing this scene, Ye Liangchen and the four True Immortals turned pale, shouting before rushing toward the faceless ghost.

"Just you? If I hadn't wanted to open the Departure, you wouldn't be alive now!" The faceless ghost sneered.

"Obedient servants, go!" The faceless ghost's voice echoed, and the old man behind him opened his eyes, flying toward the four True Immortals and Ye Liangchen.

"Zheng Bo!" Luotian recognized the old man as Zheng Tiande, the head of Longyin City. But this Zheng Tiande was no longer his former self—his body radiated black mist, and his cultivation level had surpassed True Immortal Initial.

"You too! I once left some methods on you; now it's time to use them. Once I open the Departure, you'll be my first ghost general!" The faceless ghost spoke again, his voice echoing. But Luotian knew this was directed at him.

Chapter 1920: Sudden Power Surge

"Come..." The faceless ghost's words echoed in Luotian's mind, and his expression changed. His Beast-Controlling Seal autonomously emitted black mist, spreading throughout his body.

"Buzz..." The Beast-Controlling Seal flew out of Luotian's body, hovering above his head like a dark moon, casting black mist to envelop him.

"Crash..." The ground continuously collapsed, swallowing the Endtimes Forest within moments. A series of seals covered their feet, and beneath them was a bottomless abyss.

"What's happening? I can't move!" Black mist surged into Luotian's meridians, assimilating his spiritual energy. A powerful aura spread throughout his body, and his presence continuously rose.

"Roar..." Howls echoed beneath them, spreading outward. The entire world resounded with these cries.

"Boom..." Intense black mist surged skyward, piercing through the heavens. The entire lower three realms trembled at this moment.

"What's happening!" Everyone gazed upward, where the sky was darkened by a cold atmosphere.

On the Huaxian Island, Jiang Huaxian's face was grim as he looked at the dark sky. He ordered his subordinates: "Huaxian Island, activate the protective array! Open all eight teleportation arrays and prepare to evacuate the lower three realms!"

On Huaxian Island's streets, a middle-aged man walked, his body swaying as he held a gourd and carried a sword on his back. He looked like a drunkard, but when darkness spread, his face changed abruptly.

"Gate of Hell!" The man's eyes widened in disbelief as he drew his sword, golden light slicing through the black sky. He vanished into the heavens.

At the Tianmen Sect, an elder sat in meditation. This was the sect's greatest strength—True Immortal Late Period. The elder sat on a mountain peak, his eyes flashing with intensity.

"What's happening!" He spoke gravely, forming a hand seal to collapse the heavens into void.

Meanwhile, at the Di Sect and Tie Sect, their strongest figures also opened their eyes, tearing through the heavens to enter the void. Their destination was the Endtimes Forest.

"True Immortal Initial!" Luotian's aura continuously rose, and his black mist thickened, obscuring his entire body.

"True Immortal Initial!" Luotian's heart was stunned; he discovered that the explosive power within his body—black mist condensed into rivers, surpassing spiritual energy. It was True Immortal power.

"No heavenly tribulation—directly entering True Immortal Initial! And it's still growing!" Luotian's mind was in turmoil, feeling the continuous increase of power. This made him want to stop.

"Will I keep growing until True Immortal Peak, even to the level of an Immortal King!" Luotian felt a greed for the first time.

"If I become an Immortal King, I could instantly kill my way to Yongsheng Mountain, find my lost friends, and locate Meng Ru and Si Xi!" It wasn't that Luotian lacked willpower; it was the temptation of power growth.

Since birth, Luotian's strength had been gradually built up—never like this, so fast it felt like drinking.

Luotian sensed that if he wished, he could kill Ye Liangchen or even the four True Immortal Initials of Star River Estate. It was just a matter of time.

"Delightful! Surrender your soul to me, and I'll grant you everything you desire!" The faceless ghost's voice echoed in Luotian's mind, cold yet tempting. It made Luotian waver.

"I want to become stronger!"

"Don't lose yourself! This power will surely rebound!" At this moment, two voices echoed in Luotian's mind.

"Master, hurry and stop that faceless ghost! If he opens the Gate of Hell, the lower three realms will be destroyed!" Ye Liangchen shouted at the black mist obscuring Luotian.

"Child, don't let your mind be consumed! Hold onto your heart!" The sparrow, perched in the Beast-Controlling Seal, showed rare anxiety as it spoke to Luotian.

"Come here!" The sparrow opened its mouth, sucking in Luotian's gray soul into the Beast-Controlling Seal.

But at this moment, Luotian's soul was half-black and half-gray, radiating wild energy.

"Come to your senses!" The sparrow shouted, its voice like thunder, shaking Luotian's soul. His wild eyes gradually regained clarity.

"I am Luotian, I am Luotian!" Luotian roared, his voice resolute. His gray eyes finally returned to normal, no longer wild.

"Master!" Luotian bowed respectfully to the sparrow; without its timely help, he might have been consumed by greed.

"Get out! I can only help you this far; the rest is your mess to handle!" The sparrow scolded, and Luotian's soul returned to his body.

"True Immortal Mid Period!" Upon returning, Luotian's mind was stunned. The faceless ghost's voice still echoed in his mind.

"Get out! You don't deserve to be my puppet!" Luotian roared, his voice shaking the heavens. The black mist obscuring him exploded, turning into a violent windstorm that swept outward.

Ye Liangchen was thrown back by the force, his body flying and spitting blood, his face pale.

"True Immortal Mid Period!" Ye Liangchen saw Luotian's true form, sensing his aura.

"If you don't want to submit to me, I'll destroy your soul!" The faceless ghost's voice was cold. Luotian's body tensed, and the black rivers within him flowed again, with ghost mist beginning to erode his soul.

"Child, I'll teach you the Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison Art. This art targets ghost mist and can suppress the ghost mist within your body!" The sparrow's voice echoed in Luotian's mind.

"Temporarily unnecessary; I've just reached True Immortal Mid Period. If I don't do anything, it would be a waste of this easily gained strength!" Luotian's eyes flashed with madness as he gazed at the faceless ghost.

"Crash..." Water sounds echoed, making Luotian's expression shift. He looked down and saw the ground had completely vanished, replaced by thick ghost mist rising upward.

"Yellow Spring!" Luotian saw the roaring water sounds through the thick ghost mist—truly the Yellow Spring.

"The Endtimes Forest is gone!" Luotian finally saw around him; the vast forest had vanished, replaced by overwhelming ghost mist.

"Roar..." Howls echoed as Luotian saw black figures on the Yellow Spring, powerful ghosts howling and surging toward the ground. If they reached it, it would be a catastrophe for the lower three realms.

"What did you do!" Luotian roared, stepping into the void toward the faceless ghost. He knew time was limited; he had to kill the faceless ghost before the ghost mist fully assimilated him. Then, through the sparrow's Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison Art, he could seal the ghost mist within his body. Otherwise, the consequences would be catastrophic.

"Master Sparrow, come out! Just kill this faceless ghost!" Luotian transmitted his thoughts.

"I've made a pact with the ghosts of hell; I won't interfere... helping you this far already violates some agreements!" The sparrow didn't continue but indicated it wouldn't intervene.

"Besides, this is your own karmic debt; you must handle it yourself!" The sparrow spoke to Luotian, making him shudder.

"Because of me?"

"Yes, it was when I practiced the Beast-Controlling Seal in Longyin City. At that time, a terrifying entity circled my roof—was it the faceless ghost?"

"Or was it when the three-headed dog drank all of the Yellow Spring in the Endtimes Forest, devouring the彼岸花?" Luotian's mind puzzled as he appeared before the faceless ghost, his body covered in seals. He punched forward.

One punch shook the heavens, shattering space. The black sky cracked like a mirror, splitting toward the faceless ghost.

"Get out!" The faceless ghost sneered without moving, and a line of black seals rose to block him.

"Boom..." Luotian's powerful punch felt like hitting cotton, making his expression shift slightly.

"I can elevate you to this level; how could I fear you!" The faceless ghost's voice was dismissive.

"World-Expanding Form!" Luotian didn't hesitate, his hands changing as he opened the world. His body expanded, standing like a demon in the sky.

"Hunting Sun Bow!" Luotian drew his bow, three black mist arrows forming in his hand. He bent the bow and shot, the arrows piercing through the heavens toward the faceless ghost.

"Mid-Grade Immortal Artifact?" The faceless ghost's voice remained dismissive, and three black seal dragons appeared before him.
