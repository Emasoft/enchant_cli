“Ugh…” Just as Luotian's heart sank into despair, a series of mournful cries suddenly echoed through the sky. A scorching atmosphere instantly enveloped Luotian, causing his heart to skip a beat as he gazed upward.

Moments later, Luotian's mouth hung open in astonishment, his eyes wide with disbelief.

From the sky, a humanoid flame of seven colors descended, rushing toward Luotian with lightning speed. In the blink of an eye, it reached his side.

“Puh…” The humanoid flame made a mouth-like motion, and instantly, two fire dragons coiled around the two tigers lunging at Luotian.

In less than a breath, the two tigers—nearly ending Luotian's life—were reduced to ash, leaving nothing behind.

“This…” Luotian quickly retreated, his gaze fixed on the seven-colored flame, eyes filled with disbelief.

Luotian had seen this flame only once before—the legendary fire that had reached the level of an Epoch Master within the Fire Domain.

“Ugh…” The humanoid flame turned to face Luotian, emitting mournful cries. Its voice carried a hint of familiarity.

“Are you…” Luotian felt an intense heat radiating from the flame, a sense of familiarity stirring within him. He gazed at the seven-colored fire and inquired.

“Father… father…” A childish voice echoed from within the flame, causing Luotian's heart to tremble. His eyes widened in shock.

“How could it be!” Luotian swiftly suppressed his thoughts, scrutinizing the seven-colored flame with caution.

“I… I am…” The flame seemed agitated, attempting to speak but struggling to find the right words.

These phrases were learned while searching for Luotian, and he had yet to master them fully.

“Are you Bijin Lirui Fire?” Luotian cautiously asked, the familiar warmth deepening within him, compelling him to inquire further.

“Mm… mm…” Hearing Luotian articulate his thoughts, the seven-colored flame nodded joyfully and leaped toward him.

“Wait! Wait!” Luotian quickly stepped back, dodging the flame's charge. The scorching heat instantly singed his hair.

“Bijin, your temperature is beyond my limits!” Luotian chuckled bitterly. Though his cultivation had plummeted, he still sensed the flame's terrifying power.

Luotian's heart brimmed with joy. He had never expected to encounter Bijin Lirui Fire here—clearly, it had come searching for him. Now a mere mortal, if Bijin Lirui Fire aided him, it would be an assurance of survival.

Moreover, observing the flame's drastically transformed appearance, Luotian realized it had undergone a monumental evolution. It had even凝聚 into a humanoid form, easing his heart considerably.

“Hmm…” As if understanding Luotian's words, the flame pondered for a moment before opening its mouth and inhaling.

In an instant, the flames surrounding its slender body vanished, absorbed into the child-like figure.

Short of time, a child resembling seven or eight years old emerged before Luotian's eyes. His pale pink skin appeared incredibly tender, with the most striking feature being seven-colored braids atop his head—resembling seven flames rising skyward.

“Father… father…” The child skipped toward Luotian, arms outstretched, his watery eyes filled with longing.

“Ha!” Luotian laughed heartily, scooping up the child. As he embraced the humanoid Bijin Lirui Fire, a familiar bloodline power surged within him—intensely familiar, echoing the sensation of Bijin Lirui Fire itself.

“Call me father? It's true, when you first gained sentience, you regarded me as your father!” Luotian sighed softly, recalling Luo Li. When he had left the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Li hadn't been as large as this Bijin Lirui Fire, constantly clinging to him.

“Alas…” Luotian let out a long sigh, setting the child down. After all, he was now merely an ordinary man; holding a seven or eight-year-old child was somewhat strenuous.

“We must find people soon!” Luotian looked up, spotting a hazy mountain in the distance. His eyes narrowed with contemplation.

Luotian hadn't noticed it before, but when Bijin Lirui Fire descended from the sky, he had also spotted the distant gray mountain.

Though his strength was gone, Luotian's eyesight remained sharp, and an instinct told him that this gray mountain was no ordinary place.

“What kind of place is this?” Luotian furrowed his brow, leading the humanoid Bijin Lirui Fire toward the mountain.

With Bijin Lirui Fire by his side, Luotian no longer worried about hunger. This little one could burn down beasts with a single spit of fire, even if it occasionally miscalculated the flame's intensity. Still, it managed to successfully roast some beasts on occasion.

For three days, the two—adult and child—traversed through the mountains until they discovered a city, leaving Luotian in astonishment. However, after observing the people constantly entering and exiting the city, he shook his head lightly.

Chapter 1361: Turmoil Across the Nine Domains

In a grand hall atop Wuxing Mountain on the Tianyuan Continent, Luoxiong, Luonantian, and their wife bore expressions of excitement as they listened to the Yin Fish Artifact Spirit's account.

It had been a year since Luotian last sent news, and for over a year, the three had anxiously awaited his return. Yet, no message arrived.

“Soon,” the Yin Fish Artifact Spirit declared to Luoxiong and his wife, its voice tinged with joy. “I feel this aura is drawing closer to the Tianyuan Continent!”

Five years had passed since Luotian's "death." Five years—neither long nor short.

The world had changed dramatically; the Nine Domains had seen significant progress in five years. Luoxiong and Luonantian had both ascended to the Epoch Initial Stage.

Numerous prodigies had emerged like a flood, overshadowing the old generation's powerhouses.

In the second year after Luotian's departure, Shenzu's Sun Miechen reached the Epoch Initial Stage. The old Shenzhu King Sun Shengtian stepped down, passing the throne to Miechen.

In the third year, Yan Hongtao of the Shiluo Domain and Zhou Weiyi of the Xingluo Domain also entered the Epoch Initial Stage, becoming domain lords.

With no threat from the Ming Domain, the Nine Domains' strength had surged like bamboo after rain. Sacred clans across star domains had produced domain lords capable of holding their own.

Yet, the Four Sacred Star Domains lacked a figure as pivotal as Luotian, yielding no such prodigy.

Although Xu Liyi, Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and others possessed formidable talent, their cultivation had soared over the past five years, reaching the Epoch Initial Stage. However, they still lagged behind those with divine bodies.

Now, only the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains still reminisced about Luotian. Even there, a statue of him had been erected, as Luoxiong and Luonantian had not revealed his survival. Thus, both the Four Sacred Star Domains and others regarded Luotian as deceased.

Not only had Xu Liyi's generation grown stronger, but their juniors had also gained fame across the Nine Domains.

Among them, Luotian's son, Luo Li, was most renowned. As Luo Li matured, though still only eight years old, his talent was astonishingly extraordinary. People gradually learned of the uniqueness of Luo Li's physique.

Void Dao Body—absolute control over space, as if favored by the realm itself. This revelation shocked the Nine Domains.

Luotian's daughter possessed a Spirit-Comprehending Body, a fact long known. Additionally, one of Luotian's wives was once a divine clan's goddess—Taichu Divine Body.

Nine Physiognomies, combined with Luotian's Reincarnation Body, meant his family had four of them. A single family producing four Dao Bodies—each was an unparalleled prodigy. Luotian's family had birthed four such figures, a feat beyond comprehension.

In recent years, Luo Li's terrifying prowess had surfaced. Though only eight years old, under the relentless efforts of the Four Sacred Star Domains' people, he had reached the Eight Source Supreme Stage by age eight.

Eight years old, Eight Source Supreme—though the Nine Domains' world had changed, allowing quicker cultivation, this pace was still astonishingly rapid.

People whispered that Luo Li was the second Luotian, destined to dominate the Nine Domains. No one dared imagine what he might achieve in another decade.

Not only Luo Li, but Luotian's disciples had also displayed extraordinary talent. Dong Yichen and his sister had gained fame across the Nine Domains, their cultivation reaching the Sage Stage, overpowering peers from other domains.

In the Beast Domain, changes were also significant. Long Jie became the domain lord, while the Feng Clan of the Eight Sacred Clans had defected to the Ming Domain—once abandoned.

This defection severely impacted the Beast Domain, as the Feng Clan was renowned across the Nine Domains. Faced with their betrayal, Long Jie could only let them go. The Feng Clan's rebellion had caused a brief upheaval in the Beast Domain.

However, when a young man claiming to be Luotian's disciple entered the Beast Domain's sacred city, things changed. This man was Zimo, once aided by Luotian unintentionally.

Rising through bloodshed, Zimo's growth was steeped in violence. Long Jie had tasked him with eliminating rebellious clans to hone his skills, earning Zimo fame across the Nine Domains. He always claimed to be Luotian's disciple.

Terrifying—with the rise of young prodigies, people realized the Four Sacred Star Domains' might. Each bore a resemblance to Luotian's youthful vigor.

Such an abundance of prodigies from the Nine Domains had also sparked unease, bringing invisible threats to the Four Sacred Star Domains.

The crisis began with Luo Li's return, wounded after searching for Gu Qianxue. Without his spatial control, that ambush would have killed him.

Luo Li's ambush was merely the start; disciples like Dong Yichen and Zimo, as well as all Four Sacred Star Domains' prodigies, were also ambushed.

Even Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin had faced attacks. The assailants remained mysterious, concealing their identities with supreme techniques.

Only after Jiang Nanxuan and Long Jie toured the sacred clans with the Yuan Gu Tian Gong and Yao Huang Jing did this hunt subside briefly.

Yet, within months, the attackers struck again, targeting the Four Sacred Star Domains' people.

However, the Four Sacred Star Domains had prepared well. Unless necessary, they kept these prodigies indoors; if they ventured out, strong guardians accompanied them.

“Qianxue and the others still can't be reached! It's been over a year!” Luoxiong furrowed his brow, guilt gnawing at him.

Since learning of Luotian's return, the three had tried to contact Gu Qianxue and others but failed. This left Luoxiong self-reproachful, believing their strength made them unnecessary to worry. Yet now, they remained unreachable. If Luotian truly returned, he didn't know how to face him.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous roars echoed beneath the Tianyuan Continent's starry sky, causing Luoxiong and Luonantian to pale.

“It must be here! I feel that aura has returned!” The Yin Fish Artifact Spirit's voice resonated in their minds, sparking joy on their faces.

“This is the Nine Domains!” A massive void warship pierced through space, descending over the Tianyuan Continent. Its deck teemed with people, all gazing at the black starry sky with excitement.

After a year of traversing through the guidance of yin and yang qi, the Seven Star Island people finally entered the Nine Domains.

“What is this!” The entire Tianyuan Continent was stunned, with ancient palaces emitting continuous hums. Aurora light cascaded, shielding the vast Wuxing Mountain.

“Go!” Luoxiong and Luonantian leaped into action, instantly appearing outside the Tianyuan Continent. Their eyes held awe as they gazed at the resplendent void warship.

“Old man, what is this thing? I feel it rivals the ancient palace's aura!” Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi also soared from the Tianyuan Continent, eyes wide with awe at the massive void warship.

“Someone is on that ship!” Xu Liyi exclaimed, spotting the dense crowd atop it.

“The elders there have such formidable energy!” Luonantian's eyes narrowed, observing the figures on the ship—Xuanbing Elder and others.

“Prepare Jiang Nanxuan, to greet these guests!” Luonantian urgently transmitted to Jiang Nanxuan.

“It should be friends!” Luoxiong smiled, recalling the Yin Fish Artifact Spirit's words.

“These are people from the Nine Domains,” Xuanbing Elder greeted Luoxiong and others, stepping forward with the Seven Star Island's group. His eyes held a smile.

“Are you from the Nine Domains?” Luoxiong asked, scanning Xuanbing Elder and others before his heart trembled.

“Epoch Late Stage!” Luonantian's group stared in awe at Xuanbing Elder and others, whose energy was formidable.

Now, no one in the Nine Domains had reached Epoch Late Stage. Such a powerful figure arriving here meant if they harbored ill intent, at least two domains would be needed to counter them.

“We hail from the Origin Domain,” Xuanbing Elder bowed slightly, his smile unchanged as he spoke.

“Origin Domain!” Upon hearing Xuanbing Elder's words, Luoxiong, Zheng Xin, and Gu Lei tensed.

They now knew of the Origin Domain's existence. Previously, the Ming Domain's Nine Saints had hailed from there.

“Elder, do you know Luotian?” Luoxiong's gaze deepened. He hadn't spotted Luotian on the warship and inquired telepathically.

“Luotian? Are you Luotian's elder?” Xuanbing Elder chuckled, transmitting back.

“Yes, I am Luotian's grandfather!” Luoxiong replied, his eyes gleaming. His hand clutched a token; if they acted suspiciously, he would shatter it, and the Beast Domain would send aid.

“Alas… I failed you all. Luotian is indeed a person from the Origin Domain!” Xuanbing Elder sighed, though he didn't know why Luoxiong transmitted, he replied telepathically.

“What! Where is he now!” Luoxiong's face contorted, his gaze fixed on Xuanbing Elder, voice trembling with excitement.

“He's lost…” Xuanbing Elder sighed again, his eyes bitter as he recounted Luotian's situation to Luoxiong.

“This…” Luoxiong knew Xuanbing Elder's words weren't lies, his heart sinking.

“Everyone, since you've arrived in the Nine Domains, rest here on Tianyuan Continent first! I have some matters to inquire!” Luoxiong sighed, inviting them.

“Then we'll trouble you!” Xuanbing Elder declined no, leading Yun Wuyi and others to follow Luoxiong's group into the Tianyuan Continent.

Chapter 1362: A Decade in a Snap

“Little Seven, you burned someone again?” In an ancient courtyard, Luotian barked at a child with seven-colored braids, his voice laced with exasperation.

The child was none other than Bijin Lirui Fire in humanoid form, its braids drooping as it hung its head, eyes brimming with委屈.

“Haha, Master, Little Seven didn’t mean to!” Several children in the courtyard chuckled at the drooping-haired Little Seven.

“Alas…” Luotian sighed, patting Little Seven's head. “Next time, severe punishment!”

“You all continue training!” Luotian then barked at the surrounding children.

“Yes…” Several children, dressed modestly, obeyed Luotian's command, grabbing tree branches from the ground and practicing diligently.

“Jietian City,” Luotian emerged from the forest, leading Bijin Lirui Fire to this city of people.

In Jietian City, he found no cultivators—only ordinary humans, mere mortals.

Though they couldn’t cultivate, the people practiced martial arts, albeit inferior to cultivation. Still, it helped them strengthen their bodies.

These people seemed isolated, unaware of cultivation or the Nine Domains and Origin Domain's existence.

Luotian’s strength, even without cultivation, made surviving in this mundane city effortless.

Soon, Luotian settled in Jietian City, realizing its true nature—exactly as he suspected, it was the inheritance site of Jietian Lord. Upon hearing the city's name, his suspicions solidified.

After settling for half a year, Luotian, bored, opened a martial arts academy in the city. After all, he needed to live here without relying on special means.

He displayed complex martial arts and even simpler techniques. His fees were low, so his academy thrived for a year, enough to sustain him and Little Seven.

The most troublesome aspect was Little Seven constantly causing trouble. He never stayed still, often sneaking out. Yet, he sometimes mishandled fire—sneezing would spew flames, setting homes ablaze. The flames were unstoppable, only Little Seven could retrieve them. Fortunately, no one was harmed.

But this left Luotian exasperated; in half a year, he'd paid more to cover Little Seven's mess than he spent.

After scolding Little Seven, Luotian smiled, sitting at a corner stone table. He lifted his tea and took a sip.

“Life as a mortal is truly good!” Luotian sighed, his eyes filled with contentment.

This year was the most pleasant for Luotian—no enemies, daily calligraphy and teaching children.

“If only Qianxue and Qiuchan were here!” He then fell melancholic, gazing at the distant gray mountain.

“Can one leave from there?” Luotian murmured, his eyes filled with longing. In Jietian City, he'd heard of the Jietian Mountain.

Previously, some had attempted to enter Jietian Mountain but few returned. Even those who did spoke little of it, adding mystery to the mountain.

“I'll wait until my cultivation returns!” Luotian resolved, continuing his daily life.

The people of Jietian City weren’t overly concerned; they knew a young man had arrived, a martial arts instructor teaching excellent spear techniques. Some wealthy locals offered high prices for Luotian’s calligraphy, but he refused all.

Time flowed slowly; in a blink, ten years passed. Luotian’s fame grew steadily within Jietian City.

Those who first joined his academy now held positions of influence, drawing more people to learn from him. Ten years later, over a hundred students had enrolled.

These students included wandering children and those seeking to rise above their station.

Moreover, people discovered a terrifying truth—ten years had passed without Luotian’s appearance changing. He looked even more ethereal, and the child accompanying him hadn’t aged, remaining around seven or eight years old—his mind remained unchanged.

“Three days left!” That day, Luotian finished his calligraphy, smiling. Ten years had transformed him—his sharpness faded, and he seemed more grounded.

“Though I’ve stopped cultivating for ten years, my character has improved—no waste!” Luotian sighed, gazing at the children training outside.

“Yongchun!” Luotian smiled, watching a determined youth instructing children outside.

Luoyongchun was Luotian’s first disciple, having followed him for ten years. Ten years ago, he’d been a beggar who stole buns from a restaurant and was saved by Luotian. Since then, he’d remained at Luotian’s side.

Over the years, Luotian had saved countless beggars, all taken under his wing. These people now held some strength in Jietian City, and during festivals, they visited Luotian.

“Master!” Luoyongchun approached with respect, gazing at Luotian.

“This calligraphy is for you!” Luotian handed him a scroll, speaking softly.

Hearing this, Luoyongchun was stunned; he knew how precious these calligraphy pieces were. Many had offered high prices to buy his master’s work, but Luotian had never sold them. Now he gifted him one.

“Give the rest to your fellow disciples, but not to the second or third eldest,” Luotian continued, pointing at scrolls on the table.

“Master… do you have something planned?” Luoyongchun felt a bad premonition, gazing at Luotian.

“Yes, I’m going out to explore Jietian Mountain!” Luotian spoke softly, gazing at the gray mountain beyond Jietian City.

“Master, please don’t!” Luoyongchun fell to his knees, pleading.

“Don’t worry; I know what I’m doing!” Luotian smiled, helping him up.

Over the years, Luotian had chosen disciples based on character. Though Luoyongchun had a troubled past, Luotian knew he’d been forced into it—nearly starved to death.

Luotian’s judgment was correct; other disciples had built their own careers, but Luoyongchun hadn’t left him in ten years. Serving at his side alone was enough for Luotian to gift him the calligraphy—whether he sold it or cherished it wasn’t his concern.

Hearing Luotian’s words, Luoyongchun still doubted, continuing to advise. After all, Jietian Mountain was too dangerous and mysterious.

Just as Luoyongchun spoke, a series of horse neighs echoed in their ears, causing Luotian to frown.

“Let’s go see who’s here!” Luotian smiled, stepping out of the door.

“Lu Xiong, it’s been two years—how are you?” A youth with a scar on his face leaped off a chestnut horse, smiling as he bowed.

“Second elder, why do you call him master?” Seeing the youth, Luoyongchun’s face turned angry, scolding the scarred youth.

“Why? His age isn’t much older than mine—should I call him grandpa? Ha! Grandpa is how the prostitutes at Hongyuan call their customers!” The scarred youth grinned, his eyes filled with disdain.

“Lu Xiong, let me introduce you—this is my elder, the leader of the Red Crimson Gang, Zhang Hongfeng!” The scarred youth smiled, pointing at a large man on the horse.

“Second elder! Master has shown you great kindness, feeding and teaching you for eight years—why today do you bring these bandits? What’s your intention!” Luoyongchun’s breath quickened, his body trembling with anger.

“Ha! Kindness—just spent some money at Hongyuan to have fun, and he cast me out! Why!” The scarred youth sneered.

“Still, I value relationships. Today, I came to offer Lu Xiong a fortune. Our Red Crimson Gang is short-handed and wishes to invite you to join—what say you?” The scarred youth smiled, but his face turned sinister.

“Of course, if Lu Xiong refuses, this is the result!” The scarred youth waved his hand, tossing a large cloth bag at Luotian and Luoyongchun’s feet. Blood oozed from the bag.

“Gururu…” Several round heads appeared at their feet, causing Luoyongchun’s eyes to redden.

“Sixth elder… seventh elder…” Luoyongchun roared, staring at the heads—these were his fellow disciples who had joined under him initially.

Chapter 1363: Leaving Jietian City

Luotian’s eyes narrowed, gazing at the scarred youth, his face darkened. He stared at the heads, recalling when he first took in these children—now they were killed.

“What do you say? Agree or not?” The scarred youth smiled, his expression sinister.

“Ten years—ten years without a fight! I didn’t expect to fight you people!” Luotian sighed, scanning the scarred youth.

“Did you kill them?” Luotian asked softly, his voice calm.

“Sort of. Some were tough—your disciples, they even had Elder Zhang and his men kill them!” The scarred youth replied respectfully to Zhang Hongfeng.

“One hour to decide—submit or meet the same fate!” Zhang Hongfeng spoke softly, drawing his sword from the horse. Its tip pointed directly at Luotian.

As both sides confronted, the street erupted in chaos. People gazed at Zhang Hongfeng with fear. Especially when they saw the heads on the ground, they scattered in terror, leaving only a few bold ones watching from afar.

“No need to decide…” Luotian picked up a tree branch from the ground, smiling as he tested its weight. He then slowly approached the scarred youth.

“Puh…” Luotian waved his hand, a flash of blood, and the branch pierced the scarred youth’s throat.

“Gururu…” The scarred youth stared in disbelief, blood gushing from his mouth.

“Plop…” Luotian pulled out the branch, and the scarred youth’s body fell to the ground. The Red Crimson Gang members trembled.

“Fast!” Zhang Hongfeng’s face changed, his gaze turning serious. He hadn’t seen Luotian move at all.

“Attack together and kill him!” Zhang Hongfeng ordered his ten subordinates, rushing toward Luotian.

“Yes!” The subordinates were desperate men; though Luotian had killed the scarred youth mysteriously, they weren’t afraid of him. They’d never failed to kill anyone with their combined strength.

Luotian smiled, holding a tree branch against the dozens of men surrounding him. He still walked toward them calmly.

“Puh…” Each step he took, blood splattered; bodies fell at his feet, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Master is so strong!” Luotian’s disciples watched him kill one by one, their eyes wide with awe. They hadn’t expected Luotian to be this powerful—even the Red Crimson Gang was no match.

“Not even one-tenth of your master’s strength have we learned!” A young man who had just joined Luotian’s academy spoke, his voice filled with reverence.

“I’ve followed my master for years and still haven’t seen him fight!” Luoyongchun also watched Luotian, unable to grasp how he fought.

“Plop…” When Zhang Hongfeng’s strong body fell, Luotian tossed the branch to the ground.

“Clean it up! Also, don’t bury those heads too quickly—find their bodies and bring them here!” Luotian ordered Luoyongchun, then walked into the courtyard.

“Yes!” Luoyongchun nodded quickly, directing some older disciples to clean up the dozens of corpses.

“Master is too strong!” Some bold onlookers gazed at Luotian’s courtyard and the corpses with pierced throats.

“Alas…可惜, the Red Crimson Gang has hundreds of people. Though Master killed these men, if they all come to attack him, will we be caught in the crossfire?” People murmured, then fled home.

Soon, news of Luotian killing the Red Crimson Gang spread, shaking Jietian City.

No one expected Luotian to be this powerful. Yet, while stunned, people feared the Red Crimson Gang’s retaliation and their involvement.

Even children who had learned martial arts from Luotian were taken back home, leaving Luotian’s courtyard devoid of any households within a mile.

“Master!” Luoyongchun gazed at the desolate street, looking at Luotian standing calmly.

“Did you find them?” Luotian gazed at the corpses on the ground, sighing softly.

“Little Seven, it’s time to return!” Luotian called out to the room, his voice echoing through the silent street.

“Ah… I’m back!” The next moment, a pink-faced child rushed into the room.

“Wait for your enemies to come!” Luotian patted Little Seven’s head, then sat down as if meditating.

“This…” Luoyongchun was stunned; it was a critical moment, yet his master remained calm.

But recalling Luotian’s abilities, he could only wait patiently.

For the next two days, Luotian continued his normal life. However, Luoyongchun noticed that whenever Luotian meditated, he emitted radiant light, exuding an aura worthy of worship. When he observed closely, the light vanished.

“Boom… boom…” On the third day’s arrival, at night, a beam of light erupted skyward, connecting with heaven and earth, illuminating Jietian City.

“What’s happening?” Jietian City trembled again. People gazed at the city, now lit like daybreak, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Is it a god descending?” People in Jietian City knelt before the beam, their eyes filled with devotion.

“Master…” Luoyongchun gazed at Luotian, his voice trembling.

Outside Jietian City, hundreds of men trembled, gazing at the sky-high white light. One shouted: “Deputy Leader, did we witness a miracle?”

“F*** your miracles! It’s just fake!” A middle-aged man slapped the speaking man, his eyes filled with anger.

“Look… it’s gone!” The middle-aged man watched the dimming sky, his voice cold.

“Attack in! I want to see who killed my brother!” The middle-aged man ordered his trembling hundreds of men, leaping onto their horses and rushing into Jietian City.

The hundreds charged recklessly, instantly reaching the city’s outskirts. They paused, unsure why, as the leader felt Jietian City's gate resembled a mouth ready to swallow them.

“Go!” The middle-aged man suppressed his fear, gazing at his hundreds of brothers. His courage returned, and he rode into Jietian City.
