“Perhaps he’s practicing an ultimate divine technique!” someone remarked, their eyes filled with admiration. If he succeeded, the Great Leader might become even more formidable—perhaps even a强者 who had lived through two lives could be his rival.

“Is it about to break?” Fu Xingxuan’s face bore a look of concern as she gazed into the void. She knew Luo Tian’s nature; he would not cry out in agony unless it was unbearable.

“Don’t do it! If I continue like this, I’ll die of pain!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned crimson as his mind raced with thoughts.

“Thankfully, there are acupuncture needles…” But soon after, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty. He withdrew several silver needles and plunged them into his body.

The needles pierced him, and Luo Tian muttered a curse. Though he tried hard, some were slightly off-target. Yet even the misaligned needles alleviated his soul’s torment.

“Again…” Luo Tian roared, raising his hand again. He drove the needles into the hegu point on his wrist and several other pain-relieving acupoints.

Luo Tian had studied the method of acupuncture with golden needles for half a year and sealed the curse himself. Thus, his second attempt was perfectly accurate.

“Huff…” Waves of energy radiated from several major points on Luo Tian’s body, easing the pain. He exhaled deeply.

“Now I can endure it,” Luo Tian’s face still glistened with sweat, but the crimson in his eyes gradually faded.

Two opposing forces clashed on Luo Tian’s soul—extreme power clashing endlessly. However, the Soul-Eating Pills were crafted by a蛮族 (Barbarian) king. The method to break the curse was simply enduring the pain; eventually, the curse would be dispelled.

Time passed slowly. Under Luo Tian’s expectant gaze, the icy force gradually gained dominance. Finally, in his surprised eyes, the gray soul-fire was completely annihilated by the icy force.

“Finally free from this cursed fate!” Luo Tian’s face lit up with ecstatic joy. This curse had plagued him for years; today, it was finally eradicated—how could he not be elated?

Yet the cost was significant. His soul was now weakened, and the icy force he had channeled expelled it from his body. Though pale-faced, Luo Tian felt an immense lightness throughout his body.

With a single step forward, he ignored the frozen void he had expelled and walked out of it with a smile, appearing before the Star Moon Divine Clan’s people.

“Great Leader…” The Star Moon Divine Clan had fully accepted Luo Tian’s presence. After all, even Grand Elder Fu Wenbin hadn’t spoken against him; what could they do? Moreover, Luo Tian’s character was evident to all. Upon his appearance, the clan members immediately displayed reverence.

“How is it? Has it been fully resolved?” Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan stood before Luo Tian, their faces carrying a hint of joy.

“Hmph… Finally no longer constrained!” Luo Tian nodded, his gaze turning to the three siblings.

“When will you depart for the Barbarian lands?” Fu Xingxuan sighed deeply, her eyes filled with reluctance. Though she wished to accompany Luo Tian, she knew he would never agree.

“Rest for a day; I’ll depart tomorrow!” Luo Tian mused, assessing his soul’s state. One day should be enough to recover to peak condition.

“Don’t you need us to accompany you? The journey might be troublesome!” Fu Xingyue frowned, concern flickering in her eyes.

“You accompanying me would only bring more trouble to the Star Moon Divine Clan!”

“Don’t worry. Now, it’s nearly impossible for anyone to find me. Even a powerhouse who had lived through two lives would be unable to locate me!” Luo Tian’s face bore confidence as he addressed the three.

“Alright, be careful,” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang sighed deeply before not disturbing Luo Tian’s recovery, heading to their own quarters.

“Come to my room tonight!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes glowed with a hint of redness before she spoke to Luo Tian, as if fleeing, she hurried toward her quarters.

“What?” Luo Tian’s ears caught Fu Xingxuan’s words, his mind momentarily blank.

“Is she asking me to do something?” Luo Tian’s thoughts wandered, and he flew back to his room, sitting in meditation to recover.

As night fell, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. After a day of recovery, his mental state had improved significantly; his soul was nearly fully restored.

“What does this girl want from me? Could it be about those things? What if I can’t control myself?” Luo Tian chuckled, then pushed open the door of the hall and stealthily entered Fu Xingxuan’s room.

“Xingxuan, I’m here,” Luo Tian whispered, intending to gently knock on the door. But before his hand touched it, the door opened slightly.

“Haha, even if I can’t eat her, holding hands and kissing is still nice. Taking a little advantage is also good!” Luo Tian rubbed his hands, stepping into the room with a sly grin.

Fu Xingxuan’s room was unlike others in the Star Moon Divine Clan; it exuded a fragrant aroma, clearly prepared with care.

A table stood in the center, laden with dishes. Fu Xingxuan’s whereabouts were unknown as water sounds echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

Chapter 1662: Happy Birthday ( )

“Luo Tian, you’re here. I’m taking a bath; wait a moment!” Luo Tian heard the water sounds and Fu Xingxuan’s voice from her bedroom.

“Bathing!” Upon hearing Fu Xingxuan’s words, Luo Tian’s mind conjured images of her emerging from the bath, his mouth dry.

“Hey Xingxuan, let me help you wash your back,” Luo Tian smiled and stepped toward her bedroom.

“What did you say?” Before Luo Tian reached the door, it opened. Fu Xingxuan stood before him, her face slightly flushed.

Her long purple hair cascaded over her shoulders. Her eyes sparkled with a smile, and she exuded an intoxicating fragrance that left Luo Tian dazed. Fu Xingxuan wore purple again, but this time it was more casual. Though casual, her figure remained striking, exuding a lazy charm. Her hair was slightly damp, and Luo Tian’s gaze became entranced.

“Xingxuan, you’re so beautiful…” Luo Tian couldn’t help but whisper, his eyes fixed on her as if he were a lovesick fool.

“Just your sweet talk. Tomorrow you’ll leave, so I’m treating you. All of this was made by me!” Fu Xingxuan smiled, leading Luo Tian to the table.

“Come on!” Fu Xingxuan’s face lit up with a smile as she picked up a piece of meat and placed it in Luo Tian’s mouth.

Luo Tian had no time to refuse. He bit down without hesitation.

“Hmm…” After a couple of bites, Luo Tian was about to praise Fu Xingxuan’s cooking, but his expression shifted slightly.

“How is it?” Fu Xingxuan’s face carried hope as she looked at Luo Tian, like a child awaiting parental approval.

“Hmph! Delicious!” Luo Tian devoured the food with large mouthfuls, chewing noisily before swallowing and nodding in satisfaction.

“You truly are a talent!” Luo Tian smiled, complimenting Fu Xingxuan.

“Really? This is my first time cooking; I was worried it wouldn’t turn out. I am truly a genius, hahaha!” Fu Xingxuan’s face flushed slightly with pride.

“Come on, try this. I made this dragon fish; it’s a rare treasure. The Star Moon Divine Clan rarely breeds one every hundred years!” Fu Xingyue smiled, placing a piece of fish in Luo Tian’s mouth.

“Hmm…” Luo Tian bit down without hesitation, chewing furiously. A pungent smell immediately filled his mouth, and a feeling of nausea surged through him.

“Why is this fish so smelly!” Luo Tian mentally cursed but his eyes showed satisfaction, nodding repeatedly without even chewing before swallowing.

“Try this one…” Fu Xingxuan’s face lit up with joy, again picking a dish and placing it in Luo Tian’s mouth.

“Hey Xingxuan, let’s have a drink!” Luo Tian chuckled awkwardly, raising his cup toward Fu Xingxuan.

“Eat some food first!” Fu Xingxuan, however, seemed uninterested in alcohol. To her, watching Luo Tian eat her homemade dishes was the happiest thing.

“Okay… okay…” Luo Tian sighed in resignation, accepting Fu Xingxuan’s dish again.

“Ugh…” After taking a bite, Luo Tian’s brow furrowed before relaxing into another expression of delight.

“Is it not good?” But Luo Tian’s furrowed brow didn’t escape Fu Xingxuan’s eyes. She frowned slightly, ignoring that the chopsticks had been used by Luo Tian before and placed the dish she had eaten back into her mouth.

“Wait, Xingxuan! This dish is so good!” Luo Tian quickly stopped her, swallowing the dish in one go before grabbing the plate and stuffing it into his mouth.

“One… two…” Luo Tian devoured Fu Xingxuan’s entire table of dishes in a rapid binge.

“Xingxuan, your cooking is truly delicious. I ate it all; you won’t be angry with me, will you?” Luo Tian smiled.

“You did well. I’ll reward you later!” Fu Xingxuan’s face showed satisfaction as she lightly patted Luo Tian’s cheek, making him feel light-headed and reducing the nausea slightly.

“Alright, I’ll wait for you in my room. Go wash the dishes!” Fu Xingyue said, then turned妩媚ly toward Luo Tian before entering her bedroom.

“Haha…” Upon hearing Fu Xingxuan’s words, Luo Tian’s face lit up. The thought of a reward made him restless; he couldn’t refuse to wash dishes, which was nothing for Luo Tian.

Seeing Fu Xingxuan enter her bedroom, Luo Tian quickly got up and efficiently tidied the room. This was a trivial task for him; with a flick of his hand, plates flew up, and a wave of water appeared in his palm. In no time, the table was cleared.

“Haha… Xingxuan, I’m here!” Luo Tian grinned, quickly removing his outer garment and rubbing his hands as he gently knocked on Fu Xingxuan’s door.

“Come in. Remember not to use your spiritual awareness!” Fu Xingxuan’s lazy voice echoed from the bedroom. Just hearing her voice made Luo Tian feel excited.

“I’m coming in!” Luo Tian pushed the door open and stepped into the room. However, upon entering, it was pitch black.

“This little girl must be shy!” Luo Tian didn’t mind; he thought Fu Xingxuan was just embarrassed.

“I’m here!” Luo Tian walked through the darkness, removing his undergarments as he went. Soon, his muscular upper body was exposed.

But just as he finished removing his clothes, the entire room suddenly brightened. Two figures appeared before Luo Tian, their eyes fixed on him.

“Happy Birthday!” A cacophony of voices echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making him jump. His face turned grim.

“Haha…” The next moment, laughter erupted. Eyes watched Luo Tian’s bare upper body.

Luo Tian cursed and quickly put his clothes back on, glancing at the two figures with a twitching mouth.

“Kid, what are you doing?” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue stood at the front of the group, their eyes filled with danger. Fu Xingxuan, however, stood behind them, smiling.

“Tricked!” Luo Tian’s mind immediately formed this word. His face turned red; although he was decently dressed, he knew they had seen his embarrassing state in the dark.

Luo Tian mentally cursed but couldn’t show too much. He spoke softly, “I’m a bit hot, okay?”

“Kid, don’t play dumb. This test has been passed!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang smiled, recalling that they too had eaten the food. That Luo Tian could eat it and pretend not to tell Fu Xingxuan showed he still cared about her.

“Little girl, you teamed up with others to trick me!” Luo Tian’s gaze shifted to Fu Xingxuan, who was slightly flushed.

“Earlier, I heard my three sisters say today is your birthday. I wanted to give you a surprise; I gathered everyone to celebrate. You won’t be angry, will you?” Fu Xingxuan approached Luo Tian with a pitiful expression.

“Not angry. Thank you!” Luo Tian’s heart warmed. He had lived this long but only celebrated once on the Tianyuan Continent. Fu Xingxuan remembered his birthday so thoughtfully; seeing her expression, even if he was angry, it vanished instantly.

“Alright, let’s not get drunk!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang laughed, stepping aside to reveal a table full of dishes and inviting Luo Tian over.

“Who said I want to get drunk? I just want to hold my wife and sleep!” Luo Tian muttered internally but dared not show it. He didn’t know what methods these two bastards might come up with if he refused.

However, this time none of them got drunk. They drank until midnight before Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang led Luo Tian out of Fu Xingxuan’s room.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian returned to his bed, lying down in his quarters and cursing. Thinking of Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, he wanted to curse them.

“Creak…” Just as Luo Tian lay down, the door opened slightly. A silhouette appeared in the darkness before him.

“Xing…” Luo Tian hadn’t finished speaking when his mouth was covered by a body that threw itself into his arms.

After an hour, the person in his arms felt suffocated and pulled away, leaning against Luo Tian.

“Xingxuan, I feel a bit unwell…” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in the darkness, making the person tremble slightly.

“Then… what should I do? If now… Sizhi’s sister would peel your skin…” a soft voice replied.

“Like last time, okay?” Luo Tian’s voice followed as he guided Fu Xingxuan into a sensual scene that unfolded in the darkness.

Morning sunlight fell as Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, gazing at Fu Xingxuan wrapped around him like an octopus. He smiled and kissed her gently.

Chapter 1663: Journey to the Barbarian Continent

“I’m leaving!” Luo Tian whispered softly, his gaze gentle. He knew this journey might mean they wouldn’t meet again for a long time.

“Hmph…” Fu Xingxuan curled up in bed, softly responding before falling silent. Her eyes carried a lingering gaze toward Luo Tian.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his heart filled with guilt. Some things were beyond his control. The future battle was uncertain; if the human race won, he could protect the Star Moon Divine Clan. If they lost, perhaps the clan would survive on its own, but his family and friends might not.

With a sigh, Luo Tian stepped out of the room, determination in his eyes. No matter what, he had to face it. He gazed at the Star Moon Divine Clan people without saying goodbye to Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang. He took flight, becoming a long rainbow that vanished from the Star Moon Divine Clan’s land into the dim星空 of the冥域.

“Go…” The next moment, Luo Tian pierced through the void toward the location given by Old Sa Man.

“Buzz…” As soon as Luo Tian moved, subtle waves rose from the void behind him. The waves were well-hidden, even Luo Tian didn’t notice them.

“They’re waiting for us to be out of the Star Moon Divine Clan. Intercept him on the way! This time, he won’t escape!” The thoughts exchanged among them, and then the void fell silent again.

Luo Tian flew swiftly, his form transformed into that of the Star Moon Divine Clan. This saved him a lot of trouble; no one could recognize him. Plus, with his current cultivation, even an准王 (Provisional King) couldn’t find him.

Along the way, Luo Tian gazed at the powerful ancient tribes with admiration. The human race had developed rapidly, but both low and high-level combat power still lagged behind the ancient tribes.

“Ah… I hope the war doesn’t break out too soon. Let the human race have some more time to recover!” Luo Tian muttered internally.

“Buzz…” However, as Luo Tian had half a day left to reach the Barbarian lands, waves suddenly rose in the星空. The waves spread rapidly, sealing the entire星空 and forcing Luo Tian to stop, his face showing a grim expression.

“Kid, you made us wait so long!” Before Luo Tian could react, a cold voice echoed in the星空. Several figures stepped out of the void, their aura sending shivers down Luo Tian’s spine.

“Did they find me?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, looking at the figures before his heart sank.

He recognized them all—Qi Yuanyuan, Bu Xiu, Hun Zhengqing, and the most terrifying one, Qi Hongrui, a powerhouse who had lived through two lives.

Moreover, there was a man in gray robes standing before them. His aura was familiar to Luo Tian—this was the long-lost冥族 (Nether Clan).

“Kid, your hiding skills are quite good. I almost fell for it!” Qi Hongrui smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Chronicle of the Era?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. He was confident that the only way to find him was through the Chronicle of the Era’s感应 (sensing).

“Troublesome,” Luo Tian sighed internally. His gaze was cautious as he surveyed the five people—four准王 and one who had lived through two lives. Even for a second-life powerhouse, this formation was an absolute kill.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. He immediately took out the Heaven-Devouring Thunder Sword, his gaze cautious toward the five.

“Hmph. A Chronicle of the Era treasure?” Qi Hongrui smirked, then waved his hand. A green light rose from his palm, forming a green麒麟 (qilin) that roared and transformed into a green seal hovering above the group.

“Buzz…” The Nether Clan’s man smiled cruelly, extending his hand. A gray palace emitted a grey glow, its aura suppressing everything—this was the Nether Clan’s Chronicle of the Era treasure, the King of the Nether Palace.

“Knowing your tricks, we wouldn’t be unprepared. Today, you’re definitely dead!” The Nether Clan’s准王 coldly spoke, his hatred toward Luo Tian deep.

“Kill…” The Nether Clan’s准王 rushed at Luo Tian, while Qi Yuanyuan, Bu Xiu, and Hun Zhengqing also bore cold expressions, their auras radiating as they attacked Luo Tian.

“Want to kill me? You’ll also pay the price!” Luo Tian extended his hand, launching the Heaven-Devouring Thunder Sword. At the same time, a black yin-yang fish flew from his hand, both treasures attacking the King of the Nether Palace and the green seal.

Luo Tian’s body also radiated powerful waves, his blood and qi surging. Though he knew this battle was difficult, he wouldn’t surrender.

“Boom…” In an instant, Qi Yuanyuan and the others reached Luo Tian’s vicinity, continuously attacking him.

“Kill…” Luo Tian held nothing back. Four准王 were enough to threaten him; he had to fully concentrate.

Complex runes spread across Luo Tian’s body, enhancing his strength. He formed a hand seal, and his body expanded to the size of the universe, standing in the星空 as if he stood on countless stars.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon…” As thunderous roars echoed, numerous massive fists surrounded Luo Tian, colliding with the seemingly insignificant Qi Yuanyuan and others.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sounds echoed. Qi Yuanyuan and the others, facing such a powerful Luo Tian, were also cautious. After all, countless people had died at Luo Tian’s hands.

The星空 collapsed as Luo Tian’s massive body continuously retreated. The pressure from the four准王 was too great, and what worried Luo Tian most was Qi Hongrui, who had been watching silently.

Meanwhile, the yin-yang fish clashed with the King of the Nether Palace. The Heaven-Devouring Thunder Sword also fought against the green seal. Four supreme treasures faced each other, mirroring Luo Tian and his opponents.

However, as Luo Tian was shocked, Qi Yuanyuan and the others were even more startled. They had attacked one person but only managed to push Luo Tian back without causing any real damage.

“This kid is so strong!” Qi Hongrui’s face also glowed with light, gazing at Luo Tian who was pushed back but still fought back. His hands began to gather powerful martial arts.

“You mother’s! I’ll die anyway!” Luo Tian mentally cursed. He needed to quickly deal with Qi Yuanyuan and the others; otherwise, if Qi Hongrui joined in, he would definitely die.

“Sealing King Martial Arts!” Luo Tian roared, his body with cracks bending before transforming into a洪荒 giant beast (primordial beast), rushing toward Qi Yuanyuan and the others.

“Quick…” Luo Tian’s speed was too fast. Qi Yuanyuan and the others only heard a series of explosions before Luo Tian’s massive body appeared in front of them.

“Die!” Luo Tian didn’t even throw a punch. He had no time to do so, his entire body radiating wild energy as he rushed forward like a mountain, colliding with Qi Yuanyuan and the others.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s body had reached a terrifying level. Even a second-life powerhouse would pay the price if they underestimated his physique.

Four explosions echoed in the星空, and Qi Yuanyuan and the others looked shocked, spitting blood as their bodies were thrown back, feeling like they had been hit by a mountain.

“How strong!” Their last thoughts were this before being thrown into the void.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian had also not fared well. His massive body bent down, his body emitting a crackling sound as broken bones rapidly healed.

“Kid, you’re strong. But today, unless the three powers of your human race come, no one can save you!” As Luo Tian caught his breath, a cold voice echoed in the星空. Qi Hongrui had remained silent until now, his hands moving to summon a green hand that slammed down.

“Get out!” Luo Tian saw the green hand, his eyes narrowing. He immediately launched the蛮七踏 (Seven Steps of the Barbarian), a technique from a second-life powerhouse. Luo Tian couldn’t be careless.

With a thunderous roar, golden feet stomped through the stars, colliding with the massive green hand.

The vast星空 began to collapse. The shockwave blew against Luo Tian’s massive body, sending him flying back.

“This is a second-life powerhouse!” Luo Tian spat blood, his eyes filled with caution.

“Die!” Before Luo Tian could catch his breath, another powerful aura rose from the void. Four terrifying martial arts with world-destroying energy surged forward, attacking Luo Tian.

“Roar…” Meanwhile, Qi Hongrui also moved his hands, summoning a green qilin that roared from his palm. The qilin seemed to devour the universe, roaring at Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face turned grim. The scene he dreaded most had appeared—five people attacking together, even a second-life powerhouse couldn’t withstand it.

“Xiaohei, help me block it!” Luo Tian roared, sending out golden runes. A three-headed dog howled from a golden door and stepped out.

Chapter 1664: Not Dead

“Roar…” The black three-headed dog howled, appearing in everyone’s sight. Its body was dark and ominous, radiating a fierce aura. It howled, spewing ten thousand feet of icy coldness that froze the entire星空.

“Don’t be so cool. Help me block this old man’s attack!” Luo Tian cursed, then ignored the three-headed dog’s fate. He knew if he died, this creature would still survive.

“Boom…” In a thunderous roar, Luo Tian continued to march forward, launching the Seven Steps of the Barbarian against Qi Yuanyuan and the others.

Four golden leg shadows quickly sprang from Luo Tian’s feet, colliding with Qi Yuanyuan and the others’ attacks.

The thunderous explosion echoed. Next, a violent explosion roared in the星空, and Luo Tian spat blood, his entire body obscured by chaotic waves.

Meanwhile, the three-headed dog howled and clashed with Qi Hongrui’s green qilin. The massive green qilin was bitten in half by the three-headed dog, but the three-headed dog also paid a price, its body riddled with terrifying wounds.

“Roar…” The silver eyes of the three-headed dog turned red. Drenched in blood, it fell into a feral state, ignoring its wounds and rushing toward Qi Yuanyuan.

“An impressive beast. Its strength is formidable, clearly a primordial anomaly. I’ll take it under my command from now on,” Qi Yuanyuan’s face showed greed. Who wouldn’t be tempted by such a pet?

The three-headed dog seemed to understand Qi Yuanyuan’s words, becoming even more furious. Three massive heads exhaled the universe, fire, poison gas, and ice coldness spewing from each head. Three long dragons formed, rushing toward Qi Yuanyuan.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian’s face was grim. He glanced at Qi Yuanyuan and the others; the collision had injured him, his entire leg seemingly destroyed.

“Barbarian Seven Steps Shattering Eons!” Luo Tian roared, launching the seventh step again. Facing four准王, he knew he had no time to prepare; he had to use the seventh step directly.

“Although its power is slightly less, it should be enough to kill one,” Luo Tian’s face was cold. At the same time, he moved his hands, using the Left Hand Intercepting Heaven Seal and the Right Hand Divine King Nine Heavens Map. Each martial art carried a formidable aura.

“Using three martial arts at once!” Seeing Luo Tian’s move, Qi Yuanyuan and the others’ faces changed. They knew how difficult it was to use three martial arts simultaneously.

But they were confident, their hands moving swiftly, generating powerful waves.

“Hun Tian Palm!”

“Breaking Heaven’s Strike!” The four of them roared, their martial arts flying from their hands toward Luo Tian.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Next, Luo Tian’s three martial arts collided with the four of them.

However, the Nether Clan’s strongman’s martial art—a gray seal—struck Luo Tian’s massive body directly.

The entire星空 began to collapse. The澎湃 (surging) waves sent Luo Tian flying back again, his mouth spitting blood as his body emitted a series of cracking sounds.

But this time, Luo Tian had used all his strength. Qi Yuanyuan and the others weren’t faring much better, almost being annihilated by that terrifying collision.

“Kill…” Luo Tian didn’t care about his injuries. His hands moved again, generating an immense aura. A golden ancient palace was created by Luo Tian using the梵天 attack (Brahma Attack), with divine laws flowing. The golden ancient palace became real, flying out from Luo Tian’s hand.

“Damn it!” Seeing the golden ancient palace, Qi Yuanyuan and the others’ faces turned grim. They naturally recognized it as a technique used by Gu Tian, who had previously defeated them.

The memory of Gu Tian’s defeat was too deep. Even now, with their increased strength, if they faced the original Gu Tian, they would still tremble. It was because Gu Tian had carved a blood path for the human race.

Now, seeing Luo Tian’s massive body, they flew up and stepped onto the ancient palace, rushing toward them as if seeing that person who had made them tremble before.

In their momentary hesitation, Luo Tian stepped onto the ancient palace and appeared above them. His robes flapped in the wind, as if he were a supreme warrior, pressing down with an overwhelming pressure that made Qi Yuanyuan and the others struggle to breathe.

“Block it!” Their faces were pale, fear flickering in their eyes. But they wore wild expressions, their auras and blood surging as they合力 (combined forces) to create a four-color barrier.

“Barbarian Seven Steps, Shattering Eons!” Luo Tian roared, descending and colliding with the barrier created by Qi Yuanyuan and the others.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound rose in the星空, a world-destroying wave spreading outward.

Gray turbulence swept through, instantly engulfing Luo Tian and Qi Yuanyuan. It obscured the view of Qi Hongrui, who was battling the three-headed dog.

Qi Hongrui’s face darkened. He felt Qi Yuanyuan and the others’ weakness, his heart conflicted. If under his leadership, Luo Tian could still escape and kill Qi Yuanyuan and the others, he would truly be a disgrace.

Thinking this, Qi Hongrui moved his hands. A green long sword凝聚 (congealed) in Qi Yuanyuan’s hand, its blade flashing. It continuously slashed at the three-headed dog’s massive body.

But the three-headed dog’s black flesh was incredibly strong. Although Qi Hongrui’s attacks were逆天 (transcendent), each strike caused the three-headed dog to emit a series of painful cries, black blood spilling out. Yet the three-headed dog still persisted.

“Luo Tian!” Qi Yuanyuan and the others’ eyes showed weakness, gazing at Luo Tian, who was also in a bad state. They were shocked to find they couldn’t defeat Luo Tian, and the powerful attack he had just launched almost shattered their bodies.

At this moment, if they were to regenerate blood and rebirth, the consequences would be unimaginable. They wouldn’t be able to continue fighting Luo Tian.

“Tricky!” Luo Tian panted, gazing at Qi Yuanyuan and the others. His state wasn’t great either.

“Again!” But Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty, clearly having gone mad. His hands moved again.

“He can still perform!” Seeing Luo Tian’s continued performance, Qi Yuanyuan and the others’ faces turned grim.

“I don’t believe he can keep doing this forever. If we don’t fight with all our might, we’ll be dead!” Qi Yuanyuan spoke to the three others. His body’s blood and qi began to surge, clearly fighting with all his might.

“Roar…” Qi Yuanyuan transformed into his true form, a massive body occupying half the星空. His fierce head opened its mouth, sucking in vast amounts of星空, which twisted under his suction. A deep rumbling echoed from Qi Yuanyuan’s belly, a powerful wave radiating as if preparing something world-destroying.

Yu Bujiu also took flight, his wings spreading. A series of sacred feathers emitted a holy light, gathering into an absolute arrow. A golden long bow formed in Yu Bujiu’s hand, and he drew the arrow toward Luo Tian.

Hun Zhengqing, meanwhile, moved his hands. A figure radiating overwhelming energy emerged from behind him, striking Luo Tian with a punch.

“Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Heaven!” The Nether Clan’s strongman created a gray spiritual soul-like thing, which condensed into a fierce ghost. A terrifying aura radiated from the grotesque ghost.

At the same time, Luo Tian also descended with the ancient palace, like a meteor, instantly crushing down on the four of them.

“Die!” Qi Yuanyuan and the others roared, their martial arts in a desperate state. Even Luo Tian felt a powerful threat; if one of them touched him, his body might not withstand it.

“Still no use. I’ll just let four准王 die! I won’t lose!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty. His hands moved swiftly, and the Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique was added to the ancient palace just before it collided with their martial arts.

“Boom…” Next moment, the world seemed to fall silent. The golden ancient palace collided with the four准王’s desperate martial arts, and an invisible wave spread outward.

“Ten li… hundred li… thousand li…” The invisible waves swept outward, destroying stars and annihilating them in the terrifying wave.

“Cough… cough…” Qi Yuanyuan stepped out of the void, his eyes filled with intense shock. That collision had left him in awe; if he were hit by it, even if he didn’t die, he would be severely wounded.

“Hmph?” However, when Qi Hongrui looked toward Luo Tian and the others, his eyes widened in disbelief.

In front of him, four clumps of blood mist hovered above the annihilated星空. A figure in white stood there, hunched over, his body drenched in blood. His bones were visible, emitting a radiant light.

Chapter 1665: The Final Secret Weapon

“Not dead!” Qi Hongrui’s face showed shock, gazing at Luo Tian standing in the星空 with bloodied body. He couldn’t believe that after such a collision, Luo Tian could still endure.

Qi Hongrui finally felt panic. His desire to kill Luo Tian became even more urgent. If Luo Tian continued to grow, Qi Hongrui felt he would truly become a sage in this life. That way, the ancient tribes might be sealed back into the Origin Domain again—this was not what he wanted.

“Buzz…” The four clumps of blood mist rapidly coalesced. Qi Yuanyuan and the others’ eyes showed fear, gazing at Luo Tian who was catching his breath.

“Huff…” Luo Tian caught his breath, nearly losing consciousness. His current state was at its worst.

“Although my condition is poor, you’re even worse!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty. He stepped on the星空 and rushed toward Qi Yuanyuan and the others again.
