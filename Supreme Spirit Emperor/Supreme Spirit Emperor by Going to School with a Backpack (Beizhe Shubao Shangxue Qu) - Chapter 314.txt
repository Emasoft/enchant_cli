Langya and Langxing naturally knew each other. They were born in the same era, both had participated in the selection for the Star Yang Guard at the same time, vying for a single spot. However, it was unclear why Langxing had been selected while Langya failed to ascend.

With Langxing's selection, his lineage immediately became stronger than Langya's Tianlang Mountain faction. Over the years, they had constantly suppressed Tianlang Mountain.

Originally, Langya had hoped that this time he could rely on Luo Tian's support to advance a step further. However, he hadn't expected Langxing to directly flatter Kou Tiande. He knew that Kou Tiande's background was significant—Kou Tiande, the supreme commander of the Star Yang Guard, was Kou Fenghua's elder brother.

Kou Fenghua was extremely renowned across the Star Moon Continent due to his peculiar obsession with grandeur. Anyone who outshone him in spectacle would inevitably provoke Kou Fenghua's displeasure.

At that moment, Luo Tian's appearance was indeed far more impressive than Kou Fenghua's. Thus, Langya knew this action would certainly provoke Kou Fenghua's resentment.

"Langya, our young master has set his sights on that chair. Hand it over!" Langxing bluntly pointed at Luo Tian and addressed Langya directly.

"What...?" Upon hearing Langxing's words, Langya was immediately troubled. He couldn't afford to offend Kou Fenghua, but Luo Tian was equally untouchable.

A group of Tianlang clan members immediately displayed a flicker of excitement on their faces, surrounding Langya and Langxing to watch the spectacle.

Originally, both factions had members of the Star Moon Divine Clan, which had already drawn attention. Kou Fenghua was well-known to many, and people were aware of his peculiarities. Instantly, they looked at Luo Tian, who had remained motionless with his eyes closed, with a touch of sympathy in their gazes.

Luo Tian's first entry into the Star Moon Divine Clan meant he was unknown to anyone. Everyone assumed Luo Tian was merely an ordinary member of the Star Moon Divine Clan, and even if he had some power or influence, it paled in comparison to Kou Fenghua's.

"Did you refuse what he said?" Kou Fenghua noticed Langya's hesitation and his expression of resentment deepened. He spoke coldly but did not look at Langya, instead directing his gaze toward Luo Tian, who remained motionless.

"That kid's showing off! Come down, you bastard!" Kou Fenghua, seeing Luo Tian ignore him entirely, grew even more furious. He directly addressed Luo Tian.

But Luo Tian remained seated, as if he hadn't heard Kou Fenghua's words. Facing such a person, Luo Tian was indeed uninterested in engaging. However, to avoid causing trouble for the Tianlang clan members, he slowly opened his eyes, cast a glance at Kou Fenghua, and then leapt down from the golden chair.

In an instant, Kou Fenghua's expression changed drastically; he felt a chill run through his body and began to tremble.

"Give it to him," Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice calm and composed as he looked at Langya.

"Yes!" Langya dared not offend Luo Tian either, sensing that this young man who had toppled the Tianlang Mountain was no ordinary person.

Several members of the Tianlang clan, with reluctant expressions, handed over the wide golden chair to Langxing and his group.

"Good, you're finally sensible. What's your name? I'll look after you in the Star Moon Divine City from now on," Kou Fenghua's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. Seeing Luo Tian's compliance, he didn't press further and ascended onto the golden chair with a triumphant expression.

"I'm leaving," Luo Tian smiled, handing Langya a storage pouch before ignoring Kou Fenghua's words and walking toward the towering city gate.

"Whew..." Upon opening the storage pouch, Langya inhaled sharply, his eyes flashing with excitement before turning respectful. He bowed deeply to Luo Tian and carefully tucked the pouch away as if it were a treasure.

"What did he give you? Let me see," Kou Fenghua, noticing Langya's excitement, displayed curiosity and addressed him.

"N-nothing..." Langya bit his teeth, refusing Kou Fenghua's request. The contents of the storage pouch were too precious, capable of elevating the entire Tianlang Mountain faction.

"I dare defy my orders?" Kou Fenghua's face darkened as he stepped toward Langya, raising his white hand to slap him.

"Smack..." Before Kou Fenghua's palm could land, a gust of power rose beside the crowd. A cold snort echoed through the air, instantly lowering the temperature outside the city.

"Ungrateful bastard! You dare touch my belongings!" A cold voice echoed beside Langya, and it was Luo Tian who had just stepped through the city gate.

Kou Fenghua's body was instantly propelled backward, colliding with Langxing and the other Tianlang clan members.

A clear palm print was imprinted on Kou Fenghua's face, with streaks of blood trickling from his lips.

"You dare hit me!" Kou Fenghua slowly rose, his mind reeling in shock at Luo Tian's power. Yet his face remained dark—this was the Star Moon Divine City's outskirts, and he was who? The elder brother of the Supreme Commander of the Star Yang Guard. When had he ever been treated this way?

The crowd erupted in shock, the Tianlang clan members displaying expressions of disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian. They hadn't expected anyone besides the three princes to dare challenge Kou Fenghua.

"Too fierce!" Langya stood beside Luo Tian, his mind still shaken by Luo Tian's decisive action.

"Die! I'll kill you!" Kou Fenghua's face darkened, his gaze filled with murderous intent as he extended his hand. A blue wolf-headed token appeared in his palm, hovering above a crescent moon that radiated a cold glow.

"Star Yang Command Seal... even the high-level Star Yang Command Seal, capable of mobilizing ten thousand Star Yang Guard soldiers!" Langya stammered, his voice trembling with fear.

"Lord, I surrender this storage pouch. Please spare us!" Langya cried out in fear, kneeling to the ground.

"It's too late. I've never been struck before. No matter who you are, you must die!" Kou Fenghua shouted triumphantly and activated the Star Yang Command Seal.

"Howl..." A series of wolf howls echoed out, and a green wolf-shaped illusion burst forth into the sky beyond the Star Moon Divine City. It let out a low growl.

"Boom..." Immediately after, a heavy presence erupted from the Star Moon Divine City, and a group of figures flew out in formation.

Ironclad presence instantly enveloped everyone's minds, leaving the crowd outside the city in shock.

"It's the Star Yang Guard!" All the Tianlang clan members trembled with fear, their eyes filled with reverence as they gazed at the towering green figure in the sky.

"Revere the Royal Clan!" One of the Tianlang clan members displayed a respectful expression, bowing to Kou Fenghua.

"Kill him!" Kou Fenghua's face darkened as he ordered the Tianlang clan member.

"Yes!" The Tianlang clan member didn't question, merely nodded and his presence surged with power.

"Kill!" A hundred Tianlang Guards roared, instantly locking onto Luo Tian. Their voices carried murderous intent as they rushed toward him.

"Troublesome!" Luo Tian's face remained cold, and with a wave of his sleeve, a gust of wind surged forth. The hundred mid-stage Saint-level Tianlang Guards were instantly scattered.

"He actually dared to attack the Star Yang Guard!" People became even more astonished, speechless.

"Are you out of your mind? Daring to attack the Star Yang Guard outside the Star Moon Divine City!" Everyone began murmuring, even two city guards were stirred into action and approached the crowd.

"Buzz..." However, as people marveled at the scene, Luo Tian also extended his hand. Another token rose into the air, and a cold crescent moon instantly ascended, darkening the sky.

"It's the Star Moon Guard's commander token!" Everyone was stunned, some Tianlang clan members even collapsed to the ground.

Chapter 1291: Kou Tiande

"The Star Moon Guard's commander token!" The people outside the Star Moon Divine City erupted in chatter, their faces filled with shock as they gazed at the token hovering above.

"How did he get this token?" Everyone wondered, looking at Luo Tian who stood calmly.

The Star Moon Guard was the city's defense force, composed entirely of members from the Star Moon Divine Clan. They were considered the direct subordinates of the Star Moon Divine Emperor, and it was the second son of the Star Moon Divine Emperor, Fu Xingyue, who commanded the Star Moon Army.

"Didn't you hear? The second prince Fu Xingyue suffered a major setback in the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan) recently. The supreme commander Fu Tian Gong died in the Barbarian Clan, and the second prince personally appointed a young man as the commander of the Star Moon Guard!"

"But when the second prince returned via the transmission array, he was attacked by a powerful being. Thus, the new commander was caught in a spatial rift and disappeared!"

"Two days ago, the second prince returned injured. His first action was to search for those who had accompanied him into the Barbarian Clan. This commander was especially searched for. We didn't expect someone to produce the Star Moon Guard's commander token now. Could this young powerhouse be the new Star Moon Guard commander?" People murmured, their faces filled with shock as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Fu Xingyue was injured?" Upon hearing the murmurs, Luo Tian furrowed his brows again. He thought about Fu Xingyue's return from the spatial rift and realized he hadn't been in good shape either. Perhaps someone had attacked Fu Xingyue on his way back.

"Who exactly?" Luo Tian's mind was puzzled, then he looked at Kou Fenghua who stood trembling.

"How about now? Still want to kill me?" Luo Tian slowly approached Kou Fenghua, his eyes filled with disdain.

Over a hundred Star Yang Guards bowed to Luo Tian respectfully, their faces showing reverence. Though the Star Yang Guard and Star Moon Guard were under different princes' command, since he was a commander-level figure, they couldn't afford to offend him.

"You... you... brother, save me!" Kou Fenghua shouted toward the Star Moon Divine City with a voice filled with unbearable anguish.

"Die!" If Kou Fenghua had shown submission, Luo Tian might have let him off. But instead of showing submission, Kou Fenghua even tried to call for help.

"Since you insist on escalating this, let's escalate it! I'll see if your commander brother can save you!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He took a heavy step forward, stomping Kou Fenghua's beautiful face, leaving an immediate and clear footprint.

"Ah..." Kou Fenghua felt his head seemed to crack apart. Though Kou Fenghua's strength was considerable, he had never suffered any injury before. He couldn't withstand this and let out a pitiful scream like a pig being slaughtered.

The crowd inhaled sharply, watching Kou Fenghua howling beneath Luo Tian's feet. They all grimaced, secretly thinking this new Star Moon Guard commander was truly ruthless for daring to treat Kou Fenghua so harshly.

Some people knew that the Supreme Commander of the Star Yang Guard, Kou Tiande, loved his younger brother dearly. This act was clearly challenging Kou Tiande's face.

"Commander, this man is Kou Tiande's younger brother. Should we...?" Two city guards approached Luo Tian respectfully, reminding him of Kou Fenghua's identity.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, looking at the two Star Moon Divine Clan members. His eyes flashed with a bold expression.

"I gave him a chance, but he didn't seize it. Today I'll teach you all a lesson: when dealing with such people, just stomp them back. If the sky collapses, I'll cover it for you. If I can't, then the second prince will!" Luo Tian spoke coldly and took another heavy step forward.

"This..." The two Star Moon Guards, hearing Luo Tian's bold words, felt their hearts drumming. Their eyes showed reverence instead.

"Though this statement is a bit... it's really satisfying. I've long disliked this kid!" One of the Star Moon Guards had a glint of ferocity in his eyes, silently shouting.

"Leave it to the two of you!" Luo Tian felt it was beneath him to personally deal with such a minor person as Kou Fenghua. He then kicked his leg, kicking Kou Fenghua like a dog into the feet of the two city guards.

The two Star Moon Guards exchanged glances, then bit their teeth. To leave a good impression on this new commander, they immediately kicked Kou Fenghua.

"Ah..." The screams kept coming, and Kou Fenghua felt this was the darkest day of his life.

"Stop!" Just as the two Star Moon Guards were enjoying their kicks, a cold and domineering voice echoed through the Star Moon Divine City. A tall man flew out from the city, his body radiating a fierce killing intent as he appeared above Luo Tian and others.

"You're all dead!" A powerful pressure instantly descended upon everyone, and the hundred Star Yang Guards' eyes gleamed with excitement as they gazed at the tall man from the city.

The man didn't speak further, his eyes flashing with coldness as he released a half-epoch level cultivation. A large hand filled with icy chill凝聚 (congealed) and rushed toward the two Star Moon Guards.

"Crack..." As the hand凝聚 (congealed), the two Star Moon Guards stopped their actions. Their bodies were covered in a layer of frost, their teeth chattering as they looked at the massive white hand descending.

"Killing my people in front of me?" Just as the two Star Moon Guards were desperate, a cold laugh echoed. A golden figure appeared before them, and a golden hand erupted, colliding with the icy hand.

"Crack..." The sky cracked as two hands filled with overwhelming power collided, the thunderous sound echoing. The large number of Tianlang clan members outside the Star Moon Divine City turned pale, their eyes filled with reverence as they watched Luo Tian and Kou Tiande in the sky.

"You are the new commander of the Star Moon Guard?" Kou Tiande furrowed his brows slightly, looking at Luo Tian with a cold gaze and releasing an ominous killing intent.

"Howl..." A tangible killing intent surrounded Kou Tiande, people even felt that a group of terrifying souls were wrapped around him.

"Killing intent! The killing intent condensed by the supreme commander's ironclad slaughter!" The Star Yang Guards' eyes gleamed with fanaticism as they watched Kou Tiande.

"How many people did he kill to condense such terrifying killing intent!" People were shocked, watching Kou Tiande as if looking at a demon.

"Let me challenge your killing intent?" Luo Tian's lips slightly curled, allowing the invisible storm to sweep over him. His eyes showed disdain.

In terms of killing numbers, Luo Tian was surrounded by countless souls. He had grown to this level through bloodshed and battles, experiences that Kou Tiande could never match.

"Ugh..." A series of groans echoed out, and a blood-colored killing intent burst from Luo Tian's body. It became tangible, cold and filled with intense hatred, like a river of blood that instantly enveloped Kou Tiande.

"My god! Killing intent has actually turned into a river of blood!" People were terrified, watching the Kou Tiande wrapped in a flood of blood.

"What!" Kou Tiande's eyes widened in shock. He hadn't expected Luo Tian's killing intent to be so astonishing. He himself had fought many battles and killed countless people, but he hadn't expected Luo Tian's killing intent to be several times stronger.

When Kou Tiande recovered his senses, he was already wrapped in the killing intent. A cold atmosphere instantly infiltrated his body, and Kou Tiande felt as if he was being entangled by countless souls, trying to pull his soul out of his body. He could not move at all.

"Ah..." A moment later, Kou Tiande was gradually losing his mind under Luo Tian's terrifying killing intent.

"Mad! The commander is mad, his mind has been corrupted by the Star Moon Guard's killing intent. My god, did this Star Moon Guard commander massacre several continents before?" People trembled completely, watching the sky where Luo Tian stood as if seeing a bloodthirsty demon.

"Get out..." A low roar echoed from Kou Tiande's mouth, and in the next moment, a layer of coldness wrapped around him. Under people's shocked gazes, Kou Tiande was gradually covered in ice and eventually turned into an ice sculpture floating in the sky.

"Crack..." A series of cracking sounds echoed, and pieces of ice fell from Kou Tiande's body. Kou Tiande took a deep breath and reappeared in people's sight.

"Indeed, the second prince valued you. You truly have some skills!" Kou Tiande had suffered a minor setback, and his eyes finally showed caution. His gaze toward Luo Tian became more serious.

"Idiot! If I revealed my true cultivation, one finger would crush you!" Luo Tian chuckled in his heart, but his eyes still carried a faint smile.

"Commander, your might is great!" Two city guards' eyes showed excitement as they watched Luo Tian in the sky, silently cheering.

"Now I'll take it seriously!" Kou Tiande's eyes flashed with cruelty as his presence gradually rose.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded, pretending to be serious and radiating golden light.

"You're looking for death!" Just as their presence reached its peak, a cold snort echoed in the sky.

Chapter 1292: Personal Welcome

A cold snort made Luo Tian's heart stir immediately. He smiled and looked toward the Star Moon Divine City.

A long rainbow flashed, and another handsome young man appeared in everyone's sight. Dressed in purple robes, he radiated an aura of superiority.

"Revere the Second Prince!" Everyone knelt to the ground, even Kou Tiande quickly suppressed his presence and landed on the ground. He knelt half-bowed, addressing the purple-robed youth.

"Ah... I didn't expect this Fu Xingyue to look so much like a prince when he's dressed up!" Luo Tian chuckled in his heart, his eyes showing excitement as if he had forgotten to kneel. He stood in the sky, watching Fu Xingyue who also showed excitement.

"Brother, you're back!" Fu Xingyue laughed and didn't care if Luo Tian had knelt or not. He immediately appeared in front of Luo Tian and patted his shoulder.

"How are you? Did you get hurt?" Fu Xingyue hadn't noticed the formalities and scrutinized Luo Tian.

"Alas..." Upon seeing Fu Xingyue's sincere gaze, Luo Tian sighed deeply. His eyes showed gratitude as he replied: "Thanks to the Emperor's blessings, I was injured but had already recovered on the way here!"

"What happened?" Fu Xingyue then noticed the people on the ground and furrowed his brows, showing impatience.

Luo Tian looked at Kou Tiande and then recounted the entire incident to Fu Xingyue, causing Fu Xingyue's face to darken.

"Kou Fenghua?" Fu Xingyue had heard of Kou Fenghua's name before but hadn't taken it seriously.

"Attacking the Star Moon Guard's commander is a capital offense!" Although Fu Xingyue was warm toward Luo Tian, he turned cold toward Kou Fenghua.

"Smack..." As Fu Xingyue's words fell, Kou Fenghua's face turned pale. He immediately knelt on the ground, his head nodding like a sesame seed as he bowed to Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

"Second Prince, Commander, mercy! I know I'm wrong. I won't dare again. Please spare me this time!" Kou Fenghua cried out loudly, his heart filled with regret. This small matter had accidentally drawn the Second Prince's attention.

Kou Tiande knelt on the ground, gazing at Luo Tian. His eyes flashed with killing intent—had it not been for Luo Tian, Kou Fenghua wouldn't have ended up in such a pitiful state.

"Smack..." In the next moment, a purple figure instantly appeared in front of Kou Tiande and slapped him across the face. His eyes showed authority.

"Did you have killing intent toward him?" Fu Xingyue addressed Kou Tiande, extending his white hand to lift him up.

"Never!" Kou Tiande lowered his head, feeling utterly humiliated. He dared not defy Fu Xingyue at all. After all, his status was high and his cultivation far surpassed Kou Tiande's. Fu Xingyue was a prodigy renowned throughout the Origin Domain, and although his prestige had slightly declined recently, he remained one of the top-tier figures in the Star Moon Continent. To others, he was a godlike presence.

"Good, I told you that you could have killing intent toward anyone, even my elder brother Fu Xingyang. But he couldn't. He's my savior!" Fu Xingyue spoke, his gaze deep as he locked eyes with Kou Tiande.

"Rumors spread," the crowd murmured, their faces filled with envy as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Kou Tiande didn't speak, lowering his head. He knew Fu Xingyue wasn't just speaking to him but also sending a message to those behind him—the Second Prince of the Star Moon Divine Clan, Fu Xingyang.

"Unexpectedly, he's the commander of the Star Moon Guard!"

"Yes, and he's also the savior of the Second Prince. That's why the Second Prince personally came to rescue him!" People whispered, feeling Luo Tian's status had surpassed Kou Tiande.

The commander of the Star Moon Divine Guard, the city's defense force, was one of the most loyal forces under the Star Moon Divine Emperor. Being appointed as the commander of the Star Moon Divine Guard could even grant an audience with the Star Moon Divine Emperor.

Langya stood among the crowd, stunned. He hadn't expected Luo Tian's identity to be so terrifying, so much that he felt like it was a dream.

"What should I do with this kid? Kill him or let him live, it's up to you!" Fu Xingyue looked at Kou Fenghua still bowing and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Let it go. A pest is just a pest. It doesn't matter when I crush him!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Kou Tiande and locking eyes with him.

"You owe me a favor!" Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying mockery.

Kou Tiande looked at the standing Luo Tian and felt uneasy but nodded slightly.

"Let's go. From today on, don't call yourself Xiao Mengchen anymore. I'll personally grant you the Fu surname. From now on, you're Fu Mengchen!" Fu Xingyue laughed and led Luo Tian through the crowd's respectful gazes into the Star Moon Divine City.

Compared to the wild and grand蛮荒城 (Wilderness City), the Star Moon Divine City had a different beauty. The Wilderness City was grand and magnificent, while the Star Moon Divine City was refined and noble, with every detail meticulously carved.

Not long after, under the respectful gazes of everyone, Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue arrived at a territory. Two Star Moon Guards bowed to Fu Xingyue.

The words "Star Moon Pavilion" appeared in Luo Tian's sight, and Fu Xingyue's voice echoed in his ears.

"This is my residence within ten miles, the Star Moon Pavilion!" Fu Xingyue smiled with pride as he introduced it to Luo Tian and led him into the Star Moon Pavilion, which seemed like a territory.

Along the way, handsome men and beautiful women continuously walked on the road. Seeing Fu Xingyue, they all bowed in respect, and Luo Tian couldn't help but be amazed. The members of the Star Moon Divine Clan truly seemed like favorites of heaven, with no one ugly at all.

Fu Xingyue led Luo Tian through the path and entered a grand hall. Fu Xingyue sat on an opulent chair, while Luo Tian stood there with a respectful expression.

"Alright, don't be so formal. You're my trusted person. Except for me, no one is greater than you!" Fu Xingyue spoke softly.

"I will spare no effort to assist the Emperor!" Luo Tian's face showed excitement and reaffirmed his determination.

"I said you don't need to be so formal. You don't have to bow to me; we're family!" Fu Xingyue's eyes showed impatience and waved his hand.

"Tell me, what happened after you stepped out of the spatial rift? Did you encounter any danger?" Fu Xingyue looked at Luo Tian and asked.

"No, I heard the Emperor was injured," Luo Tian recounted how he had fallen into the Tianlang Mountain and arrived at the Star Moon Divine City, then asked Fu Xingyue.

"Yes, I was attacked after stepping out of the spatial rift!" Fu Xingyue's face darkened when he mentioned his injury.

"Who attacked you? They even summoned a powerful being! If it weren't for another powerful being's help, we might have died in the spatial rift. If we had truly died there, it would've been terrifying—no trace of death at all!" Luo Tian felt a shiver and secretly warned himself not to use transmission arrays in the Origin Domain unless absolutely necessary.

"Other royal clans! Don't be fooled by their apparent harmony; they're all scheming against each other behind the scenes!" Fu Xingyue shook his head lightly.

"If I had truly died in the spatial rift, the Barbarian Clan would be the most likely suspect. My father would inevitably turn against them, and once hostilities began, two continents would clash. The result is predictable!"

"Still, it's understandable. Now the resources in the Origin Domain are dwindling. Even if they don't fight now, within a few centuries, they'll inevitably start fighting over the dwindling resources. Unless one enters the other end of the Origin Domain, the Nine Realms!" Fu Xingyue looked at Luo Tian with a smile.

"The Nine Realms?" Luo Tian's heart jolted, looking at Fu Xingyue with a puzzled expression, feigning ignorance about the Nine Realms.

"In fact, our Origin Domain is a sealed star domain. You might not know this, but besides the ancient tribes, there's another race—humanity. Now, only the Barbarian Continent still has human existence!" Fu Xingyue assumed Luo Tian was unaware and explained.

Luo Tian feigned ignorance, listening carefully to gain effective clues from Fu Xingyue.

"None of that matters. The humans in the Seven Star Island won't survive much longer; they'll be exterminated soon!"

"But what puzzles me is the attack I encountered after entering the Star Moon Continent. Although those people masked their presence well, I still felt a trace of the Star Moon Divine Clan's aura on them," Fu Xingyue said, his eyes flashing with coldness.

"Alas..." Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, as if exhausted, and said to Luo Tian: "Mengchen, I'm tired. Actually, I have no desire for the throne. I only wish to cultivate and reach enlightenment. But I can't help it; even if I choose to step down, my elder brother won't believe me. So I have no choice but to face it!"

It seemed he had opened his heart, and Fu Xingyue's words grew more numerous. Luo Tian felt moved; in the imperial family, there was no true kinship—brothers schemed against each other like this.

At that moment, Luo Tian had fully understood: the person who had attacked Fu Xingyue was likely one of his elder brothers, Fu Xingyang or Fu Xingchen.

Chapter 1293: The Alchemy Hall

Night...

Luo Tian sat in the luxurious room arranged by Fu Xingyue, his eyes filled with contemplation. He was thinking about how to proceed within the Star Moon Divine Clan, a habit he had always maintained.

Luo Tian had gained valuable information from Fu Xingyue, such as the entrance to the Nine Realms connected with the Star Moon Divine Clan, known as Lei Ming Pavilion. It was controlled by the Star Moon Divine Clan's Conclave of Elders, who guarded it together.

The Royal Conclave of Elders was as powerful as a sect in the Nine Realms, composed of retired Star Moon Divine Emperors. To infiltrate it was like a dream.

Luo Tian also learned that Lei Ming Pavilion would erupt with endless divine lightning every century, which had the effect of refining one's body. Additionally, the lightning sea would孕育 (cultivate) a substance called Star Moon Lightning Stone, which greatly aided cultivation.

Every time the lightning sea erupted, the Star Moon Divine Clan would open Lei Ming Pavilion, allowing those who had made great contributions to the clan to enter and enhance their cultivation while collecting Star Moon Lightning Stones.

"This is the best opportunity for me to enter. No matter what, I must first check on the seal!" Luo Tian thought to himself, his eyes filled with determination.

"But although I am the commander of the Star Moon Guard, I have no merits and haven't caught the Star Moon Divine Emperor's attention. He won't let me enter Lei Ming Pavilion easily!" Luo Tian continued to think.

"To gain merits, killing enemies is the best method. However, now that the royal clans are tense, I can't control whether hostilities will break out!"

"But there's another method: surrendering treasures to exchange for merits! Or demonstrating other talents to prove my potential!" Luo Tian thought, his eyes flashing with light.

"Alchemy!" Luo Tian recalled his only skill—exchanging elixirs for merits.

"The Star Moon Divine Clan's alchemists are extremely rare, and alchemists are exceptionally precious. Perhaps I can use alchemy to obtain everything I need!"

"Also, in the Star Moon Divine Clan, I can't use the martial arts I've used before. I need to learn new ones! That way, I won't expose myself!" Luo Tian made up his mind and began to cultivate.

In the morning, a series of thunderous sounds interrupted Luo Tian's cultivation, making him slowly open his eyes.

Luo Tian stepped out of the luxurious room. As the commander, his residence was naturally vast. Fu Xingyue had even assigned nearly a hundred Star Moon Divine Clan attendants to serve him.

Compared to the attendants of the Tianlang clan, these Star Moon Divine Clan attendants were truly celestial beings. In human lands, each of them would be a disaster for the country.

Luo Tian knew that if he wanted, these attendants would obediently enter his room to serve him. This was the benefit of power.

"Leave!" But Luo Tian clearly had no interest in this. His four wives had an invisible aura around him, making him uncomfortable whenever he thought of deviating.

Luo Tian stepped out of the courtyard and headed toward the gathering place of the Star Moon Guard. After all, he was the commander of the Star Moon Guard and had duties to fulfill.

In the military field, nearly ten thousand Star Moon Divine Clan youths stood in formation with curious expressions. They had heard that today was the day their commander returned and also learned about Luo Tian's deeds outside the city.

Luo Tian stepped into the military field, gazing at the well-organized Star Moon Guard. He couldn't help but admire them silently; these Star Moon Guards looked like pretty boys, yet their battle spirit was undeniable.

"Hello everyone! I'm your commander. My name is Fu Mengchen!" Luo Tian smiled and stepped onto the platform, addressing the ten thousand Star Moon Guards below.

"Yes!" A deep voice echoed from the Star Moon Guards, their voices thunderous and overwhelming. Invisible power radiated from each of them toward Luo Tian.

"Hmph!" A cold expression appeared on the face of a man standing beside Luo Tian—this was Fu Zhiming, the deputy commander of the Star Moon Guard.

Fu Zhiming felt some resentment. After years of diligent service in the Star Moon Guard, he had expected to ascend after Fu Tian Gong's death. However, it was a young man he hadn't heard of who had taken his position instead.

A powerful pressure enveloped Luo Tian, but he didn't care. His face remained smiling as the overwhelming power swept over him, making his robes flutter in the wind.

"Alright, everyone go do what you need to do. Remember one thing: wherever you go, don't back down. My Star Moon Guard mustn't be cowards! Don't provoke trouble, but when trouble comes, don't fear it. Whatever happens, I'll cover for you. If I can't, the Second Prince will!" Luo Tian spoke loudly with authority, and his voice exploded in the ears of the ten thousand Star Moon Guards. They all displayed shock before respectfully exiting the military field.

"You're Fu Zhiming?" Luo Tian turned his head and looked at Fu Zhiming with a subtle gaze, speaking softly.

Fu Zhiming's body trembled. Seeing the depth in Luo Tian's eyes, he felt as if he had fallen into a cold pool. A chill enveloped him, and his face showed respect.
