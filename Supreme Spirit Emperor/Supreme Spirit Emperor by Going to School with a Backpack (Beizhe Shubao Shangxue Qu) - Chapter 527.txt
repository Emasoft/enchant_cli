“This is really bad luck…” the squad leader thought, his heart heavy with bitterness. He had been delighted before when Ye Chen challenged him, but in the end, Ye Chen was afraid of the ghost energy erupting and voluntarily withdrew, granting him ten thousand battle merits without reason.

Unexpectedly, those ten thousand merits hadn’t even warmed before another challenger arrived. If he lost, he would gain twenty thousand merits, but to reclaim his position as squad leader, he’d have to challenge others again.

“I’ll see what you’re made of!” the squad leader’s face twisted with madness as he locked eyes on Luo Tian.

“The outcome is unlikely to be surprising. Earlier, Luo Tian had subdued the day with his body, and this squad leader is certainly no match for him,” people murmured.

“Boom…”

“I’m sorry!” Luo Tian pushed off the ground, his face still pale but his body leaping like a golden-winged great peng, rushing toward the squad leader.

“Get back!” The squad leader roared, his body rising like a storm as he launched a punch straight for Luo Tian’s throat.

“Such combat tactics—others might fall for it, but not me!” Luo Tian thought to himself. In terms of combat experience, he had no fear of these seasoned squad leaders.

“Boom…” A blur of motion—Luo Tian’s fist struck the squad leader’s chest, while his other hand swiftly caught the punch aimed at his throat.

“How is this possible!” The squad leader’s eyes widened in disbelief. He had expected Luo Tian to guard his chest, never imagining he would strike the throat.

The impact sent the squad leader stumbling back but quickly regaining his footing, his feet sinking into the earth.

“Again!” The squad leader’s face twisted with resentment as he launched himself at Luo Tian once more.

“Luo Tian, the alchemist, is truly a prodigy—his elixir craft is unparalleled, and his strength is equally terrifying!” The onlookers marveled.

This time, the squad leader delivered a long punch aimed at Luo Tian’s head, but it was actually meant for his chest.

“Boom…” The result remained unchanged—Luo Tian caught the punch and kicked the squad leader back.

“I refuse to believe it!” The squad leader wiped blood from his lips, his eyes burning with resentment. How could Luo Tian have seen through his feint?

“Boom…” But the squad leader met disaster, his body plummeting from the sky. Each attack, Luo Tian precisely targeted where the squad leader intended to strike.

“This is a feint!” Luo Tian observed, his lips curling into a smile as he soared forward, launching a punch at the squad leader’s face.

“Think you can trick me?” The squad leader sneered, his body instinctively activating a protective mode. He reached for Luo Tian’s fist.

“Boom…” The golden fist smashed into the squad leader’s face, deforming it completely as he collapsed onto the ground.

“How is this possible!” The squad leader’s hand, which had reached for Luo Tian, hovered over his chest. His swollen eyes widened in shock as he spoke.

“Feints require you to believe them yourself—deceit begins with self-deception!” Luo Tian spoke softly, causing the squad leader’s body to tremble.

“I’ve lost,” the squad leader admitted, his eyes filled with respect. Though he didn’t yet grasp Luo Tian’s words, a strange sense of truth lingered in his mind.

“Haha! Brother Tian, we’ve found a place to stay!” Ye Liangchen laughed loudly, his gaze sweeping over the onlookers as if he himself had become Luo Tian.

These past months, Ye Liangchen had endured enough—sleeping under the open sky in this compound, longing for even a dilapidated hut.

But without battle merits, he hadn’t dared challenge the squad leaders, enduring months of humiliation and losing weight.

“A single hut for two people is cramped,” Luo Tian chuckled, “so I want a courtyard. That way, my elixirs won’t disturb others.”

“A courtyard…” Ye Liangchen’s face shifted slightly as he turned to Luo Tian.

“Only the Hundred Commanders can live in a courtyard within the military camp,” he murmured.

“Does Luo Tian plan to challenge the Hundred Commander?” Others overheard and exchanged glances.

“Madness! Luo Tian must be mad—Hundred Commanders are mostly at the True Immortal Initial Stage, even the Intermediate. Luo Tian may be strong, but how can he face True Immortals?” People whispered, staring at Luo Tian as if at a madman. Today’s display had shocked them all.

“Brother Tian, maybe we should slow down. Hundred Commanders are tricky,” Ye Liangchen added, surprised by Luo Tian’s boldness.

“Luo Tian is showing off! A million merits—clearly, he’s just showing off!” Ye Chen and Qin He Feng thought, their disbelief palpable.

“I wish to challenge the Hundred Commander!” But Luo Tian’s words drenched them in cold water, silencing their protests.

“Bravery!” The dozen Hundred Commanders standing nearby instantly admired him, surprised Luo Tian had dared to challenge them.

“Choose me! Choose me!” Meanwhile, the Hundred Commanders in the courtyards felt exhilarated.

A million merits was no small sum for them. To them, Luo Tian’s challenge was like a gift of merits.

“Hum…” Yellow light descended from the sky, sweeping through the Hundred Commanders’ courtyards before landing on a burly man, who immediately beamed.

“Haha! Luo Tian, don’t hold back!” The man stepped out, his eyes alight with excitement—people could almost see the million merits in his gaze.

“Is it Huo Zhen? Now Luo Tian is truly doomed!” The crowd’s faces shifted as they recognized the man.

“Why did it draw Huo Zhen? Everyone knows his body is invincible, ascending to Hundred Commander purely through brute strength!” People murmured.

Challenging ranks—The Great Heaven City’s formation would assess opponents based on their strength. The Eighth Army had countless Hundred Commanders, but Huo Zhen’s name was unforgettable due to his unmatched strength.

“Luo Tian is doomed!” People chattered, pitying him.

“The unselected Hundred Commanders sighed in disappointment, feeling like they had lost out.”

“Luo Tian, don’t worry—I’ll return the million merits to you if you lose. Just join my squad!” Huo Zhen called out.

To Huo Zhen, Luo Tian’s value far exceeded a million merits. Not only was his strength formidable, but he would surely rise beyond Hundred Commander. Even just the Ghost-Repelling Elixir made him indispensable in Great Heaven City.

“No need, I accept the loss!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, adjusting his breath. This Huo Zhen felt like a formidable opponent.

“Kill!” In an instant, Luo Tian and Huo Zhen leaped into the air like two fierce dragons, charging at each other.

“Any technique is meaningless against absolute strength!” Huo Zhen murmured, his body radiating divine laws.

“Let’s play!” Luo Tian chuckled, his body glowing with divine light, but his speed doubled.

“Crack!” Before their words faded, a thunderous sound echoed through the heavens as their bodies collided.

“Both chose direct body combat!” The crowd roared, but what stunned them was Luo Tian’s refusal to fall behind.

“Thorny opponent!” Luo Tian thought, feeling as if he had collided with a mountain, his bones nearly shattered.

Huo Zhen shook his head, dazed from the impact but now viewing Luo Tian with respect.

“Again!” Huo Zhen roared, pushing off the ground to charge again, and Luo Tian soared without fear.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sounds never ceased as the two clashed repeatedly, their speed increasing until the crowd could barely follow.

“Luo Tian’s body is truly terrifying—he matches Huo Zhen evenly! If Luo Tian wins, he’ll be the youngest Hundred Commander in Great Heaven City’s history!” People whispered, watching two streaks of light collide, occasionally blood droplets falling from the sky.

Chapter 2020: Surrender ()

The thunderous sounds never ceased as Luo Tian and Huo Zhen clashed countless times. Both were riddled with wounds, their bodies stained red, yet their eyes burned with intensity.

“Divine War God’s True Will!” Huo Zhen roared, his hands moving swiftly. A divine light descended from the sky, enveloping Huo Zhen’s body like a sacred radiance. His wounds healed instantly, and his aura surged.

“It’s the Divine War God’s True Will! Who knew Huo Zhen hailed from the Divine War God Sect? We’ve been unaware all these years!”

“He never used it before. Not even during his challenge against a squad leader, but now he’s exposed it!” People murmured, gazing at Huo Zhen, his body glowing with divine light.

“Barbarian God’s Battle Chant!”

“Manifesting the World!” Luo Tian roared, his voice echoing. His body was enhanced by the chant, and a hundred-foot figure materialized before them.

“Barbarian God’s Wrath Shatters the Heavens!” A golden foot descended like a sky itself, causing the crowd to gasp in fear.

The compound prohibited martial arts, but body combat like “Barbarian God’s Step” was allowed.

“Roar!” Huo Zhen howled, his voice shaking the heavens. Golden divine laws flowed around him as he raised his arms to the sky.

“Crack!” The sound of cracking echoed, cracks spreading under Huo Zhen’s feet. His arms’ veins pulsed violently.

“Get out!” Huo Zhen growled, his arms suddenly exerting force. Luo Tian’s mountain-like body trembled and began to fall.

“Luo Tian has broken the Barbarian God’s Step!” The soul of the Divine War God stepped out from outside the compound, gazing at Luo Tian’s wobbling figure.

“Tsk tsk, Luo Tian has met his match!” Jin Xiyang’s face bore a cruel smile as he watched Luo Tian swaying.

While the Divine War God and Jin Xiyang were awed, other geniuses and veterans were more stunned by Luo Tian’s strength.

“If it’s purely body combat, Luo Tian could defeat a True Immortal Initial Stage!” A Hundred Commander spoke, admiration in his voice. Even the Thousand Commanders nodded approvingly.

“If his elixir craft allows him to establish himself in Great Heaven City, this is his foundation!”

“Regrettable—such a promising talent was caught by that bastard Zhang!” A voice echoed from the nine Thousand Commanders’ palaces.

“This kid truly surprised me,” a middle-aged man said, his face showing relief but also a hint of weakness.

“Senior Brother… should we call Tian over?” Two youths saw the man’s weakness and asked.

“No, let him meet me after he becomes a Thousand Commander,” the man sighed.

“Before that, you mustn’t meet him. I need him to reach me through his own strength; only then will I feel at ease,” the man added.

“Don’t worry, I can still hold on. If not for this, we might have already lost our lives! This exchange is worth it!”

“Commander-in-Chief didn’t go to fetch the First Elixir Master, right? Maybe there’s still hope!” The man addressed them.

“Boom…” On the other side, Luo Tian’s massive body suddenly collapsed, returning to his normal size.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian spat blood, gazing at the equally battered Huo Zhen. Neither had won yet.

“Barbarian God’s Step didn’t work either?” Luo Tian panted heavily, wanting to vomit his heart out as he stared at Huo Zhen.

“You’re truly strong!” Huo Zhen panted, gazing at Luo Tian.

“I’ve lost!” Two voices echoed simultaneously as both looked at each other, surprise in their eyes.

“Haha… exhilarating!” Huo Zhen laughed, stepping toward Luo Tian, who also chuckled and approached.

“Both said surrender at the same time!”

“A draw? No, there’s never a draw!”

“Probably it will determine who surrendered first. The one who surrenders loses!” People murmured, watching Luo Tian and Huo Zhen.

“Hum…” The humming sound echoed as yellow light descended from the sky, sweeping toward Luo Tian and Huo Zhen. The light hesitated before landing on Luo Tian, forming a set of armor that enveloped him.

“My luck was better,” Luo Tian smiled, extending his hand toward Huo Zhen.

“Clap!” Their hands met, and Huo Zhen smiled: “No problem. Even if I’m not a Hundred Commander, I can fight again!”

“Hundred Commander, Luo Tian!” The crowd gasped, gazing at the man standing there. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to succeed—Great Heaven City had never seen anyone ascend so quickly.

Strength was one aspect, but the terrifying million merits for a newcomer in the military camp was unimaginable.

“Congratulations, Luo Tian, on becoming a Hundred Commander!” Voices of praise echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Damn it! He got ahead of us!” Ye Chen and Qin He Feng glared, Luo Tian now a Hundred Commander while they remained ordinary soldiers.

“Huo Brother, I’m sorry—ten days later, I’ll send you ten Ghost-Repelling Elixirs!” Luo Tian smiled, but the words made people gasp.

“Luo Tian Brother, I have something to ask, but I’m unsure if it’s appropriate,” Huo Zhen said, his eyes flickering.

“Huo Brother, please speak.” Luo Tian nodded, curiosity in his gaze—Huo Zhen had made a good impression.

“I’m currently a Squad Leader, and now you’re a Hundred Commander. A Hundred Commander can recruit 100 subordinates, including Squad Leaders. I wish to surrender to Luo Tian Brother—do you accept?” Huo Zhen said earnestly.

“Huh…” Upon hearing Huo Zhen’s words, Luo Tian was stunned. The crowd also looked surprised—Huo Zhen had gone this far.

“Gambling! Huo Zhen is gambling—betting that Luo Tian will surely rise and have a place in Great Heaven City!” People gazed at Huo Zhen, admiration in their eyes.

“Good! As long as I have a meal, I won’t let Huo Zhen Brother starve!”

“You’ll realize soon that today’s decision is the most valuable of your life!” Luo Tian’s brows flickered. Huo Zhen’s surrender at this moment was genuine, a gift of support for Luo Tian.

“Commander Zhang Desheng also wishes to surrender!” Zhang Desheng shouted, his voice sincere. If Huo Zhen had surrendered, why not him?

“Luo Tian Hundred Commander, I wish to surrender!” As Zhang Desheng’s words ended, others quickly spoke up, expressing their desire to join Luo Tian.

“Liangchen, tally the numbers. I’ll go rest,” Luo Tian told Ye Liangchen, his eyes weary—alchemy and combat had left him exhausted.

“Sure!” Ye Liangchen’s face lit up. Luo Tian becoming a Hundred Commander meant he could recruit people, significantly increasing their safety.

“Luo Tian got ahead of us—Thousand Commanders, I won’t let him get in front of me!” Ye Chen and Qin He Feng’s faces hardened, determined not to be overshadowed by Luo Tian.

“Don’t eat too fast!” Qiu Qian Di stood behind Ye Chen, addressing him. His gaze was surprised as he watched Luo Tian leave.

“We’ll act first; others follow the main force!” Ye Chen told Qiu Qian Di, his mind made up. Among their group, he and Qiu Qian Di were the strongest; Ye Chen had decided to get rid of these burdens.

“Yes!” Ye Die and others were startled but nodded.

……

Luo Tian’s name spread rapidly through the Eighth Army. For the Eighth Army, having a new alchemist who could craft Ghost-Repelling Elixirs was good news.

Even more shocking was Luo Tian’s terrifying strength—challenging two ranks, his body at the peak of True Immortal battling Huo Zhen, who was famed for his body. He won and became the fastest Hundred Commander in the Eighth Army’s history.

In just three days, over a hundred people surrendered to Luo Tian—these included several Squad Leaders under Huo Zhen. Each Squad Leader had nine subordinates, but these weren’t counted in the hundred.

Ye Liangchen also recruited many people. Luo Tian fully trusted Ye Liangchen; though he played the spoiled brat, Ye Liangchen was a shrewd man.

Ye Liangchen returned to his former self, always followed by over a hundred people, acting arrogantly.

As for merits, Luo Tian’s group seemed bottomless—each day he produced five Ghost-Repelling Elixirs, worth forty thousand merits. They were evenly distributed, giving each person more merits than usual.

They upgraded their equipment—each had at least one mid-tier divine artifact, making others jealous.

More people wanted to surrender to Luo Tian, but Ye Liangchen refused further recruitment. “A hundred is enough,” he said. The rest came for the merits, and quality mattered more than quantity.

Time passed slowly; only two days remained until the three-month period. The camp’s atmosphere grew tense.

“The Eighth Army has two days left for rotation. Everyone prepare—next month, we’ll be the主力 to fight ghosts!” A stern voice echoed in the inner palace.

“Yes!” Nine voices responded—Zheng was the nine Thousand Commanders!

Chapter 2021: Blood Surface ()

Guarding Hell, the Great Heaven City had eight armies. Each month, one army was assigned to guard Hell, so they rotated every seven months.

This month’s battle against ghosts was painful yet joyful for the defending army. Painful because they fought day and night, preventing any ghosts from entering Great Heaven City. Joyful because their merits would skyrocket—after this month, they could exchange merits for anything in Great Heaven City.

“Haha! Finally it’s our turn!” Voices echoed through the compound as soldiers cheered.

“Damn, I couldn’t escape it!” Ye Liangchen looked pitifully at the nine dragons’ pearl palace.

Before, he had tried to use his family’s connections to avoid participating in ghost battles. But Ke Duanshan showed no mercy, and the matter ended without resolution. Ye Liangchen was even scolded by Ke Duanshan, who called him a fool before calming down.

“Don’t worry, Liangchen—I’ll protect you as much as I can!” Ye Chen’s face showed battle intent, gazing at Luo Tian.

Due to the rotation, those who had left the Eighth Army had to return for battle. Thus, those who had gone out alone also returned. Ye Chen and Qin He Feng had recently promoted to Squad Leaders, striving toward Hundred Commanders.

“Senior Brother, don’t forget me!” Ye Liangchen quickly spoke, then felt uneasy, gazing at the hundred people Luo Tian had recruited.

“Your main goal is to protect me. These merits mean nothing to you. As long as I’m safe, after returning, I’ll share my merits with you. I’ll also have Senior Tian craft Ghost-Repelling Elixirs for you!” Ye Liangchen shouted, his voice clearly showing fear.

“Sigh…”

“Ye Sheng, Ye Wudao, and Ye Tian—three brothers who were all mighty. How could they have such a spoiled descendant? It’s disgraceful for the three!” Other sects’ geniuses sighed, their eyes filled with disdain.

“Don’t worry, Liangchen! Don’t be nervous—just follow me!” Luo Tian smiled, not minding Ye Liangchen’s cowardice. In his view, Ye Liangchen’s fear was natural—nobody wanted to die.

“Let’s go, I’ll show you how to deal with it!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He wasn’t confident here, and he knew Great Heaven City wasn’t as safe as people thought.

Before coming, he had heard from Lu Chong and Jiang Yuansheng that Great Heaven City was struggling. The implication was clear—possibly it would fall, but why? Luo Tian didn’t know yet.

A hundred people stood neatly in the courtyard, with Huo Zhen at the front, followed by thirteen Squad Leaders—Zhang Desheng and others. The last were ordinary soldiers, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Here are some elixirs—distribute them to the brothers!” Luo Tian sighed, waving his hand. Thirteen storage bags fell into the Squad Leaders’ hands.

“Training soldiers for a day, using them at night—everyone is the best soldier, experienced beyond me!”

“I hope that whenever we fight, as many return as went out!”

“These elixirs should be enough for a month. If they run out, I’ll make more!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the one hundred and forty people.

“That’s all I can do,” Luo Tian sighed, then gazed at Ye Liangchen.

“Also, please have everyone take care of Liangchen—he’s new to battle and will be nervous!”

“Huo Zhen Brother, stay with him these days!” Luo Tian kept assigning tasks.

“Yes!” Huo Zhen shouted, his voice booming. Others also shouted in unison.

These past days, Luo Tian hadn’t been harsh—these people weren’t ungrateful. Over time, they had grown to respect Luo Tian’s character.

“Alright, rest well these two days!” Luo Tian spoke again, then said nothing more, sitting cross-legged on the ground, waiting for the rotation.

Two days passed quickly; on the third day, a light rose from the dark sky.

The light revealed Ke Duanshan standing above, his gaze stern as he addressed the compound.

“Eighth Army, Black Armor Division rotates!” His voice echoed across the heavens.

As his words faded, the camp erupted with black light—ten thousand soldiers in perfect formation.

Uniform black armor and iron masks obscured their faces, ten thousand Black Armor Soldiers standing in the sky. Their aura was formidable, a killing intent spreading.

“Elite among elites!” Luo Tian marveled at the ten thousand Black Armor Soldiers, considering them the best soldiers he had seen. He felt a sense that with these ten thousand soldiers, they would be an unstoppable weapon.

“Go!” Ke Duanshan smiled, addressing the ten thousand Black Armor Soldiers. His words fell, and they swiftly dispersed toward Great Heaven City’s walls.

Each Black Armor Soldier stood rigidly on the walls, gazing at endless black mist like a shield.

“This is the Eighth Army’s Black Armor Division—truly elite!” People in Great Heaven City marveled.

“Seventh Army evacuates!” A cold voice echoed, a golden light rising from the walls. It stood beside Ke Duanshan—golden armor like the sun, contrasting with Ke Duanshan’s black. Yet their aura was equally terrifying.

“Seventh Army Commander, Gao Zhanxiu!” Huo Zhen stood before Luo Tian, his eyes respectful as he gazed at Ke Duanshan and Gao Zhanxiu.

“Hum…” A long sword cut through the air, Gao Zhanxiu wielding a golden divine sword. It soared toward Ke Duanshan’s hand.

The golden sword radiated terrifying sword intent, as if piercing the darkness. It landed in Ke Duanshan’s hand.

“That is the Great Heaven Sword, a sacred artifact of Great Heaven City. Though it’s a mid-tier divine artifact, it holds special significance—wherever its blade points, all ghosts retreat. Only the defending commander can wield it,” Huo Zhen explained to Luo Tian.

“Finally, I can rest!”

“Brother, you’ve worked hard!” The golden-armored soldiers who had stood on the walls saw the Black Armor Division arrive, relaxing and greeting them before descending.

“Nine Thousand Commanders, lead our Eighth Army to the battle zone!” Ke Duanshan announced loudly. Nine figures leaped from the compound.

“Those are our Eighth Army’s nine Thousand Commanders—each at True Immortal Peak!” Huo Zhen’s eyes remained respectful.

“Who is the masked Thousand Commander?” Luo Tian frowned, spotting a blood-stained mask on one of the figures in the sky. He felt a strange familiarity.

A medium-built figure, wearing blood-red robes, stood out with an aura that seemed young but bore white hair.

“This is one of our Eighth Army’s celebrities—called Blood Face. His surname is Zhang, but no one has seen his face except the Commander and his two disciples.”

“Legend says he entered Great Heaven City directly from Hell, killing countless ghosts. Later, he broke through to become a Thousand Commander and was rewarded with massive merits. His two disciples became Hundred Commanders.”

“Over time, Blood Face rose to Thousand Commander, and his two disciples became Grand Commanders.”

“His merits alone could support a Thousand Commander,” Huo Zhen whispered.

“Is he someone I know? No, something’s off—how could anyone reach True Immortal Peak so fast?” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at Blood Face’s masked figure. His eyes narrowed in thought.

“You’re looking at me?” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, startling him. He met Blood Face’s masked gaze—his eyes were aged and weary.

“Boom…” Before Luo Tian could react, a black hand slammed down with thunderous force, aiming to crush him.

An overwhelming pressure enveloped Luo Tian’s body, making his face pale. A sense of helplessness gripped him as he struggled to breathe and trembled involuntarily.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. This Thousand Commander was unpredictable—just a glance and he wanted to kill him.

A Thousand Commander could easily eliminate a Hundred Commander. Everyone was stunned by Blood Face’s move, puzzled why he targeted such a minor Hundred Commander.

“Interesting!” The other eight Thousand Commanders smirked, gazing at Luo Tian barely standing under the black hand. Some Grand Commanders also looked confused, especially Bai Shuize, who had been warned by Blood Face not to attack Luo Tian.

“Is that Luo Tian? What did he do to anger the Thousand Commander?” People wondered.

“Die! Die!” Ye Chen and Qin He Feng’s faces showed cruel joy, watching Luo Tian bleed.

“Roar!” Luo Tian roared, a life-threatening crisis engulfing him. He couldn’t use the Great God Array against True Immortal Peak—just a weak ant.

The black hand carried icy intent, nearing Luo Tian. He even considered using the Book of Epochs.

Chapter 2022: That One Glance ()

“Don’t push me!”

“I don’t want to be your enemy. If you press further, I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned red as he roared at the masked Blood Face.

“What do you mean by ‘pressing’? Killing me? Big talk! I’ve lived long enough to have countless killers chase me. Even when a million ghosts chased me, they failed. I fought my way back from Hell to Great Heaven City. I’ll see what you’re made of!” His cold eyes held no emotion, his voice sending shivers through everyone.

“Arrogant! Daring to kill a Thousand Commander?” Qin He Feng and Ye Chen’s faces showed more disdain.

“Thousand feet… hundred feet… fifty feet…” The black hand closed in, and Luo Tian’s eyes finally turned wild.

“Who the hell is this Thousand Commander? You just glance at me, and you want to kill me! I’ll look at you too—what can you do?” Ye Liangchen shouted, throwing seals toward the black hand.

“Boom…” Hundreds of martial arts techniques erupted, colliding with the black hand.

“Oh? Then I’ll kill you too!” Blood Face sneered, pointing his finger. A black dragon surged from his hand into the black hand, making it swell again.

“If you insist on pushing me, today I’ll test your strength!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, gazing at Blood Face.

“Boom…” As his words faded, the black hand that had been about to crush Luo Tian suddenly shattered. A gust of wind swept over him.

“Blood Face, the rotation is just beginning—don’t shed blood! Give me a favor and let this kid go. He still has some use for Great Heaven City,” Ke Duanshan spoke softly, gazing at Blood Face.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled, sweat pouring from his forehead as he stared at Blood Face. If Blood Face attacked again, he would immediately absorb the ghost ball and activate the Book of Epochs to destroy Blood Face.

Though it would expose the Book of Epochs, Luo Tian’s life was worth it.

“Commander-in-Chief’s favor is one I must respect. This matter ends here, but kid—don’t think you’re safe! Next time I glance at you, I’ll destroy you!” Blood Face spoke coldly. People shivered, their fear of Blood Face deepening—just one glance and he killed. His brutality was etched in their minds.

“Thousand Commander! When I become one, I’ll show you!” Luo Tian seethed inwardly. Blood Face’s unreasonable behavior had enraged him.

“Blood Face’s favor is indeed great—Commander-in-Chief even cooperates with him!” The eight Thousand Commanders thought, noting Luo Tian’s image.

“Senior Brother’s move was truly ruthless!” Two youths with blood masks stood among Blood Face’s group, watching Luo Tian’s red eyes.

“This kid should be pushed—probably he’s already furious and will train harder to surpass Senior Brother!” They thought, smiling beneath their masks.

“Alright, go!” Blood Face spoke softly, as if forgetting the incident, addressing those on the ground.

“Yes!” A thunderous roar echoed, and they marched toward the battle zone in unison.

“Ten thousand… one hundred thousand…” Tens of thousands soared into the sky, including Grand Commanders, Hundred Commanders, and ordinary soldiers—all under Blood Face’s command.
