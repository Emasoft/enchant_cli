“Luo Tian! One day, I will make you wish you were dead!” Li Xiuping cried in his heart as the seal shattered, and he fled toward the distance.

“Return!” At the very moment Li Xiuping escaped, Luo Tian’s cold voice resonated in people’s ears, as if imbued with some mystical power.

Li Xiuping’s blood, which had transformed into a crimson mist, abruptly halted upon the voice’s descent. A powerful suction formed in Luo Tian’s hands.

Amid Li Xiuping’s desperate roar, the blood floated back into Luo Tian’s palm.

“I said you must die—painfully!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with cruel intent, and his suction intensified.

“Grrr…” Under this overwhelming force, Li Xiuping howled in agony.

This suction was unlike the previous one; it directly targeted Li Xiuping’s soul, tearing his spirit from his body with brutal precision.

This technique was the very one仇太平 (Chou Taiping) had used to restore his soul after possessing Luo Tian. Luo Tian, deeming it too cruel, had never employed it before—but now, he resolved to end Li Xiuping with the most merciless method.

Amid Li Xiuping’s wails, his soul was forcibly extracted and hovered before Luo Tian. Already weakened, Li Xiuping’s condition deteriorated further, his soul reduced to a fragile state, as if a single gust of wind could scatter it.

“Don’t think this is over!” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a cruel smile as he gathered Li Xiuping’s blood, his gaze icy as it locked onto the soul.

“Sizzle…” A streak of emerald flame leapt from Luo Tian’s palm, enveloping Li Xiuping’s soul. The flames burned relentlessly at his withered spirit.

“Luo Tian, dare to kill me!” Li Xiuping’s soul howled in anguish.

The disciples of the Feiyun Sect, including Yu Pengfei, wore expressions of terror as they gazed at Luo Tian’s grim visage.

They glanced at Li Xiuping, now engulfed in the Bijin Lilu Fire, their mouths twitching involuntarily. How deep must the hatred be for one to torment another so cruelly?

“This is Feiyun’s first prodigy, Li Xiuping?” A disciple murmured, a strange unease stirring within.

The agony of the soul surpassed physical pain by countlessfold, searing at the very essence of one’s being.

“Bijin Lilu Fire! Excellent, excellent!” The tomb guardian’s eyes flashed with sharpness before a smile curved his lips.

“I intended to burn you for forty-nine days, but I have other matters to attend to—this is your fortune!” Luo Tian sneered.

That sneer sent a shiver through the Feiyun disciples. Forty-nine days—Li Xiuping’s gray soul burned relentlessly, darkening the emerald flames to an eerie green. The disciples could not fathom the torment, their skin prickling at the thought.

“Enough,” Luo Tian’s gaze softened with regret as he waved his hand, and Li Xiuping’s soul was utterly consumed by the Bijin Lilu Fire before the disciples’ wide-eyed stares.

“Thus, you are truly dead—no chance at reincarnation!” Luo Tian sneered again, waving his hand.

In that motion, Li Xiuping’s blood reappeared before the onlookers.

“What else does he intend to do with this lifeless blood?” The crowd murmured, numbly watching Luo Tian.

Chapter 499: I Do Not Wish to Kill

Chapter 499: I Do Not Wish to Kill

“Stop pretending!” Luo Tian sneered, and the Bijin Lilu Fire surged again, consuming Li Xiuping’s blood entirely.

As the blood neared complete dissolution, a wail echoed in their ears: “Luo Tian! I will haunt you even as a ghost!”

“He still lives!” The Feiyun disciples gasped, stunned. They had not expected Li Xiuping to survive such a fate.

Even Yu Pengfei was taken aback; Li Xiuping had defied all odds, surviving the annihilation of his soul.

“I said I would erase you completely—no chance to become a ghost!” Luo Tian sneered, his fingers twitching. The emerald flames devoured the last drop of blood.

Li Xiuping, Luo Tian’s adversary for years, was now annihilated at Chen Yunting’s tomb. His body and soul vanished entirely from the world.

“Is that Li Xiuping? Our sect’s former prodigy?” The Feiyun disciples whispered.

“Dead…” A disciple who had once attacked Luo Tian stared in wild-eyed disbelief, his blood igniting as he lunged at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s gaze flickered with coldness; he sensed the disciple’s despair, a man who had nothing left to live for.

“Who is this?” A disciple asked, bewildered by the man’s madness.

“I recall! Li Xiuping once saved this disciple, Xiao Zhengchu!” Another disciple exclaimed, gazing at the defiant Xiao Zhengchu.

“Go… today I mourn Yunting—I do not wish to kill!” Luo Tian waved his hand, snatching Xiao Zhengchu and hurling him to the ground.

“Hah… Luo Tian! Even if I cannot kill you, I will make you regret this forever!” Xiao Zhengchu roared, his body swelling like an inflated balloon.

“Self-destruction!”

“He intends to self-destruct!” Yu Pengfei’s face paled, shouting as golden energy enveloped the disciples behind him.

The crowd gazed in awe at Xiao Zhengchu, their disbelief palpable. They had not expected such hatred toward Luo Tian.

Self-destruction was rare; it annihilated both body and soul, leaving no trace—only in desperation would one choose it.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened; a late-stage Bone-Devouring disciple’s self-destruction would harm him, but not kill. Yet if Xiao Zhengchu succeeded, the tomb’s graves might be caught in the blast.

The most vulnerable would be Chen Yunting’s grave, closest to Xiao Zhengchu.

“Playing self-destruction? You are not worthy!” Luo Tian sneered, his wings of spiritual energy materializing as he soared into the sky. A small cauldron appeared in his hand.

“Behold! He has ascended to the Nascent Soul Realm!” The Feiyun disciples gasped, shouting in unison.

Yu Pengfei’s expression was one of admiration; he had spent nearly a century to reach the Nascent Soul Realm, yet this youth—barely in his twenties—had achieved it. How astonishing!

“Seal-Soul Cauldron, subdue!” Luo Tian sneered, and the cauldron descended upon Xiao Zhengchu.

Xiao Zhengchu’s body was at its peak, the late-stage Bone-Devouring form emitting cracks and pressure. The crowd could imagine the devastation if it exploded.

But as they gaped, the azure cauldron above emitted a heavy aura, expanding rapidly.

“Hum…” The cauldron’s pressure surged, crushing Xiao Zhengchu.

The cauldron hovered for a moment before appearing above Xiao Zhengchu’s head.

“What is that?” The Feiyun disciples trembled, even under Yu Pengfei’s protection. They felt the cauldron’s overwhelming power.

Yu Pengfei marveled; as a low-level Nascent Soul disciple, he could not fathom the cauldron’s might. Once activated, it would shatter even Nascent Soul disciples.

At the cauldron’s arrival above Xiao Zhengchu, his body halted mid-explode, his chaotic energy easing.

One breath… two… three—within three heartbeats, Xiao Zhengchu returned to normal.

Luo Tian did not let the cauldron descend further; he feared Xiao Zhengchu’s blood would stain Chen Yunting’s grave.

After Xiao Zhengchu recovered, Luo Tian transformed into a streak of multicolored light, appearing before him. He struck Xiao Zhengchu’s dantian with a fist.

“Crack!” Xiao Zhengchu’s dantian shattered, his spiritual energy spilling from his body.

“Hmph,” Yu Pengfei exhaled, relief washing over him. If Xiao Zhengchu had succeeded in self-destruction, he would have suffered greatly.

Luo Tian seized Xiao Zhengchu’s neck, a cold smile on his face: “Since you are so loyal to Li Xiuping, I shall grant your wish!”

As he sneered, a powerful suction pulled Xiao Zhengchu’s soul into his palm. The Bijin Lilu Fire erupted, consuming the soul entirely.

Xiao Zhengchu’s body was thrown to the ground, landing before the disciples who had previously attacked him.

Their gazes toward Luo Tian now changed completely, devoid of arrogance—only terror remained.

“Damn him! He’s no human!”

“He seems like a demon!” The Feiyun disciples fell silent, their eyes filled with fear as they stared at Luo Tian.

“No blood was spilled,” Luo Tian murmured, turning to Yu Pengfei: “Senior Yu, please clean Yunting’s tomb. I shall repay your kindness.”

“Of course!” Yu Pengfei no longer regarded Luo Tian as a junior but as an equal—or even higher. He knew he was no match for Luo Tian now.

Chapter 500: The Transformation of the Wild Sword Sect

Chapter 500: The Transformation of the Wild Sword Sect

In the Northern Region, within Tianyuan City’s Wang Estate.

Wang Pengtian, the head of the Wang family, paced anxiously in his courtyard, hands clasped behind his back.

The entire estate—nearly ten thousand feet in size—was empty, save for Wang Pengtian.

“Swoosh…” A figure appeared before him: Wang Tianxiang, his face resolute.

“Why have you returned?” Wang Pengtian roared upon seeing him.

“I believe in my uncle’s promise—he will come, and he shall.” Wang Tianxiang’s face was determined.

“Though I cannot trust the family, I can trust my life with him.”

“This matter stems from me; I cannot let my father bear it alone,” Wang Tianxiang interjected before Wang Pengtian could protest.

Seeing his son’s unwavering gaze, Wang Pengtian felt both joy and a softened expression.

“Good. Today, we shall witness how they destroy our Wang family!” Wang Pengtian’s aura surged with late-stage Bone-Devouring power.

“Foolish! You still dare to seek refuge? Otherwise, your family shall perish today!” A mocking voice echoed. Wind howled in their ears, darkening their gazes.

A white-cloaked youth appeared, flanked by Bone-Devouring disciples.

“Wu Laier! You said three days, yet you came so soon—can’t wait to meet your dead brother?” Wang Tianxiang met the man’s gaze without fear.

“Little brat! Today, you shall join your brother in death!” Wu Laier’s face twisted with menace.

The youth, Wu Youde, was the second son, hence his nickname “Wu Laier.” Yet over time, some noticed the irony in his name—“Wu Laier” sounding like “no second.”

Wu Youde had long since realized the implication, and for years, no one dared call him “Wu Laier.” His grandfather had ascended to the Nascent Soul Realm, granting him immense power within the Wild Sword Sect.

The sect’s master, Wang Tianxiang’s mentor, was merely a Nascent Soul beginner. The Wild Sword Sect, with its shallow roots, ranked among the second-tier sects—far behind the Feiyun Sect.

Wu Youde’s grandfather’s ascension to Nascent Soul had thrilled the sect, but Wu Youde himself saw it as a burden. He believed his grandfather’s power would secure him the sect’s leadership.

After two years of scheming, Wu Youde’s grandfather had secretly framed Wang Tianxiang’s master, the sect’s leader. Though Wang Tianxiang escaped, Wu Youde’s brother pursued him and was slain in a fierce battle.

Wang Tianxiang fled to the Wang family, whose roots ran deep in Tianyuan City. The Five Elements Sect had warned against attacking secular families, so the Wild Sword Sect granted Wang Tianxiang three days to surrender.

Wu Youde, desperate for vengeance after his brother’s death, disregarded protocol and descended to the Wang estate.

Without hesitation, Wu Youde waved his hand at the Bone-Devouring disciples behind him, his face dark with intent.

“Kill!” Wang Pengtian and Wang Tianxiang sneered, their resolve unshaken. With Luo Tian’s two high-grade spiritual weapons, they fought like gods.

The estate echoed with thunderous clashes as buildings crumbled. Though Bone-Devouring disciples lagged behind Nascent Soul masters, their combat created a deafening din.

“Not bad for these weapons,” Wu Youde sneered, his eyes gleaming as he lunged at Wang Tianxiang.

Wang Tianxiang and Wang Pengtian were surrounded by three Bone-Devouring disciples each. Initially, they fought with resolve, but as time wore on, their strength waned—especially Wang Tianxiang, a Bone-Devouring intermediate against three of the same level.

A golden palm struck Wang Tianxiang’s chest, shattering his ribs. He spat blood and was hurled ten feet before regaining composure.

“Crushing Heaven’s Palm!” Wu Youde sneered, his hand凝聚 into a massive strike.

“Hammering the World!” Wang Tianxiang roared, his hammer glowing with spiritual energy.

The golden hammer materialized in the sky, embodying heaven’s will as it clashed with Wu Youde’s palm.

Though Wang Tianxiang was a disciple of the sect’s leader, his talent paled compared to Luo Tian. Yet against Wu Youde, he was far superior.

Still, four against one proved too much. While Wang Tianxiang and Wu Youde clashed, the other three disciples attacked relentlessly.

“Boom!” The sky thundered as a trio of sword qi merged into one, striking Wang Tianxiang.

“Done for!” Wang Tianxiang’s heart sank; one qi he could handle, but three would leave him severely wounded.

“Crush!” But as despair gripped him, a cold voice echoed in their ears.

The sword qi above him shattered instantly, its energy scattering onto Wang Youcai’s face.

Chapter 501: Killing

Chapter 501: Killing

A cold aura descended upon the group, sending shivers through their bodies.

“Nascent Soul Realm!” Wu Youde’s eyes widened in fear, gazing at the figure above. The seven-colored wings shimmered under sunlight, and the young man’s face bore an icy killing intent.

“Luo Tian!” Wang Pengtian panted, his strength drained after the battle. Without his spiritual weapon, he would have collapsed long ago.

“Uncle!” Wang Tianxiang’s eyes lit up with joy as he saw the figure.

“Senior, I am here to settle some family matters. Please grant me a favor; the Wild Sword Sect will repay you!” Wu Youde dropped his arrogance, bowing respectfully.

He saw no shame in addressing a younger man as “senior.” After all, the man was a Nascent Soul master. Even if he were merely a beginner, they could not afford to offend him.

“Wild Sword Sect?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed as he descended, his gaze questioning Wang Tianxiang.

From what Luo Tian knew, Wang Tianxiang was the sect’s leader’s disciple—why would he be hunted by his own sect?

Seeing Luo Tian’s inquiry, Wang Tianxiang recounted the events.

“Uncle! Save the Wang family!” Wang Tianxiang knelt before Luo Tian, his face respectful.

“Uncle?” Wu Youde was stunned; he hadn’t expected the Wang family to have a Nascent Soul ally.

“Rest assured, I shall handle this,” Luo Tian smiled, preventing Wang Tianxiang from fully kneeling.

He turned to Wu Youde and his disciples, eyes like lightning.

Seeing Luo Tian’s unhidden killing intent, Wu Youde immediately dropped to his knees, fear in his eyes: “Senior, mercy! I did not recognize your might. Please spare me for the Wild Sword Sect’s sake!”

“Finished? Then you may die!” Luo Tian sneered, his voice cold. His mood was foul after mourning Chen Yunting.

Ignoring Wu Youde’s pleas, Luo Tian summoned a spiritual energy hand and struck Wu Youde.

Wu Youde’s face was etched with regret as his disciples fell to their knees, begging.

“Deal with them,” Luo Tian turned to Wang Tianxiang and Wang Pengtian.

“They are Wu’s lackeys!” Wang Tianxiang spat, hatred in his voice. If not for them, his master would not have died so easily.

“Crack… crack…” As Wang Tianxiang spoke, the disciples’ bodies cracked.

Wang Pengtian’s eyes widened in fear; a Bone-Devouring intermediate was slain with a single gesture.

“Go to the Wild Sword Sect and finish this!” Luo Tian nodded to Wang Pengtian, grabbing Wang Tianxiang and soaring into the sky.

“Guide me!” Luo Tian wasted no words, his eyes alight with excitement as Wang Tianxiang pointed the way.

Wang Tianxiang had not expected Luo Tian to be this strong—Nascent Soul Realm, and seemingly a seven-element Nascent Soul. Such power was rare across the Tianyuan Continent.

“Uncle, the Wild Sword Sect has an elder at Nascent Soul peak. Are we not overstepping?” Wang Tianxiang asked as he guided Luo Tian.

“Nascent Soul peak?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smile. Though he was merely a Nascent Soul beginner, an elder at peak would pose no threat. With his methods, he could escape even a Nascent Soul peak’s grasp. Plus, this was the Five Elements Sect’s territory—no one dared defy him.

Seeing Luo Tian’s confident aura, Wang Tianxiang relaxed his worries, admiration in his eyes. He recalled how years ago, Luo Tian was merely a Cultivation Nine stage disciple. Now, he had ascended to Nascent Soul—unfazed by even peak Nascent Soul masters.

As they conversed, Luo Tian marveled at Wang Tianxiang’s transformation—no longer the arrogant youth but a composed and calm man.

“Here!” Wang Tianxiang gritted his teeth, hatred in his gaze as he stared at a thousand-foot mountain.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared above the summit, gazing at the Wild Sword Sect nestled atop.

“Five Elements Sect! Luo Tian has come to pay respects!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed through his spiritual sense, resounding across the sect.

“Five Elements Sect? Luo Tian?” The Wild Sword Sect disciples exchanged glances, confusion on their faces. Five years had passed since Luo Tian’s name became infamous in the Northern Region, but none recognized him. Yet a Nascent Soul beginner was no threat.

Luo Tian stood high above, the disciples unaware of his wings or his true cultivation. If they saw it, they would be even more astonished.

“Haha… The Five Elements Sect’s disciple has come to our sect. What is your purpose?” A deep voice echoed, calming the disciples.

A golden light flared in the sect’s central hall, and a golden-winged figure appeared.

Luo Tian observed the elder, noting he was merely a Nascent Soul beginner before speaking: “I have come to kill.”

Hearing this, Wu Qingtian’s face darkened. Seeing Wang Tianxiang hovering beside Luo Tian, he understood immediately and his expression soured.

Luo Tian’s reputation had long been feared across the Northern Region, and Wu Qingtian felt a shiver at his icy gaze. Though he was Nascent Soul, the fear of Luo Tian’s power made him tremble.

Chapter 502: Purge

Chapter 502: Purge

“Did you come for Wang Tianxiang?” Wu Qingtian’s face shifted, then he forced himself to calm.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded and ignored Wu Qingtian, descending onto the Wild Sword Sect’s courtyard.

Wu Qingtian waited for an answer but found Luo Tian unresponsive, so he descended to the ground. The awkwardness was palpable, but Wu Qingtian followed reluctantly.

As Luo Tian and Wu Qingtian landed, the sect’s disciples and elders gathered around. Some recognized Luo Tian and gasped in shock.

“Wang Tianxiang! How dare you return? You traitor!” The disciples roared, but fear of Luo Tian kept them from attacking.

“Traitor?” Wang Tianxiang’s eyes burned with hatred toward Wu Qingtian, then he noticed some disciples who were close to Wu Youde. He understood immediately.

Some elders, once kind to him, now glared with hatred, their intent clear if not for Luo Tian’s presence.

“Silence!” Luo Tian sneered, his overwhelming aura pressing upon the disciples.

They felt a mountain’s weight above them, struggling to breathe. Even their breaths were stifled, fearing the pressure would crush them.

“Did I betray my master? You say that?” Wang Tianxiang roared, lunging at Wu Qingtian but was pulled back by Luo Tian.

Regaining composure, Wang Tianxiang addressed the elders: “All of you know my conduct in the Wild Sword Sect. Please, truthfully—would I do such a thing?”

“No! You fled the sect after your master’s death, leaving no vigil. That proves your guilt!” A disciple shouted.

“You are the one who killed him! Wu Dazhang has confirmed your master was poisoned, and you fled in fear!”

“Indeed! We were blind!” Others joined the accusations.

But many elders wore puzzled expressions, sensing something was amiss.

“You are Chu Chengye? Your grandfather is our sect’s fourth elder, right?”

“You… and you…” Wang Tianxiang pinpointed the accusers.

As he did, their figures appeared before him uncontrollably. At first, it was unnoticed, but when several were revealed as Wu Qingtian’s allies or descendants, their faces darkened.

“Wu Qingtian, do these people seem familiar? They are your loyalists—your power stems from them!” Wang Tianxiang sneered.

Wu Qingtian’s face darkened, his gaze shifting as the disciples’ expressions changed.

If not for Luo Tian’s presence, Wu Qingtian would have killed Wang Tianxiang on the spot. But with Luo Tian there, it was impossible.

“Foolish child! Your master’s death is a fact. The sect elders have decided to expel you. For your connection with Luo Tian, I shall spare your life—now leave the sect!” Wu Qingtian spoke, knowing he had no more time.

“Hmph. Are you the sect leader? Then show me the Wild Sword Seal!” Wang Tianxiang sneered, pulling out a bronze seal from his storage bag.

Seeing it, Wu Qingtian’s face paled—the main reason for hunting Wang Tianxiang was this seal. If Luo Tian were not present, Wu Qingtian would have killed him instantly to claim it.

“Everyone knows my master’s cultivation. Before his death, he told me he was to die and entrusted the Wild Sword Seal to me!” Wang Tianxiang coldly spoke.

“Then I ask you, Wu Dazhang—why didn’t my master deliver the seal to you? With his Nascent Soul power, he could not have lasted long enough!” Wang Tianxiang’s gaze was mocking.

“Boom!” Wang Tianxiang’s words exploded like a bomb among the disciples, shaking their beliefs. Their gazes toward Wu Qingtian shifted, gradually trusting Wang Tianxiang. His past actions were clear, and now the evidence was undeniable—Wu Qingtian had poisoned his master and plotted to seize power.

“Flee!” Wu Qingtian acted without hesitation, his golden wings transforming into a meteor as he soared skyward.

“Did I let you go?” Luo Tian sneered, the Bijin Lilu Fire engulfing the sky.

“Enough! I leave these to you,” Luo Tian laughed, patting Wang Tianxiang’s shoulder. He flicked his finger, and the Bijin Lilu Fire formed a sword, piercing the dantians of those Wang Tianxiang had targeted.

After this, Luo Tian’s wind surged as he appeared before Wu Qingtian, his spear—Crack Heaven Spear—materializing.

The spear transformed into a golden light, its tip radiating an aura that could pierce anything. The second form of Crack Heaven Spear—“Breaking Stone and Metal.”

“I’ll fight you!” Wu Qingtian, knowing escape was futile, brandished his sword.

The events took less than a quarter-hour. The Wild Sword Sect disciples, seeing Wu Qingtian’s flight, realized Wang Tianxiang was truthful. Their faces turned angry.

“Come! Purge all of Wu’s allies and those connected to him—kill without mercy!” An elder commanded, leading disciples toward Wu’s residence.

Chapter 503: Self-Destruction of a Sacred Artifact

Chapter 503: Self-Destruction of a Sacred Artifact

As the elder departed and orders were given, the Wild Sword Sect disciples sprang into action, cleansing Wu’s faction. Wang Tianxiang, his lips twisted in grim satisfaction, marched toward the defeated disciples with his high-grade spiritual hammer.

“Crack!” Wang Tianxiang struck without mercy, reducing a disciple to meaty pulp. Blood splattered everywhere.

“Wang Senior! You cannot kill me—after all, you taught me!” The disciples and elders gaped in fear.

“Kill…” Wang Tianxiang gave no explanation, his long-held resentment spilling out as he struck repeatedly. The courtyard soon turned crimson with blood.

“Crack!” Wang Tianxiang’s hammer struck the ground, cracks spreading beneath it. His bloodshot eyes gazed at the two figures now tiny in the sky.

A heavy pressure resonated from ten thousand feet above, suffocating Bone-Devouring disciples.

“Luo Tian! Be merciful—later, we may meet again. You truly wish to kill a Bone-Devouring disciple for his sake?” Wu Qingtian roared, his body battered.

Wu Qingtian now sought retreat; Luo Tian was terrifying. Every attack he launched had no effect, not even a ripple. Yet Luo Tian’s attacks were devastating—whether through the Life-Devouring or Crack Heaven Spear, Wu Qingtian suffered a level of damage he could not match.

“Calling him a pest? You are no different from one—just a stronger pest!” Luo Tian sneered, his Life-Devouring attack striking Wu Qingtian.

Wu Qingtian’s face paled, his life force fading as blood trickled from his mouth. His gaze was fierce, but he could not escape Luo Tian’s speed.

“Don’t force me to self-destruct!” Wu Qingtian hissed, spitting three drops of blood into his body. His power surged just enough to withstand Luo Tian’s assault.

“Do you regret it?” Luo Tian laughed loudly.

“I do not regret my self-destruction, but I do regret his!” Wu Qingtian roared, summoning a long sword.

“Roar…” The sword’s emergence was accompanied by a dragon’s cry, its green aura swirling around it.
