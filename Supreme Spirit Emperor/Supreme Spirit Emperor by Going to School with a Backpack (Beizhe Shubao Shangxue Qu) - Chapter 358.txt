In his line of sight, a golden dragon darted through the grey mist, its massive body coiling around a stone statue. The dragon's sinews stood out prominently, and the stone statue was tightly bound by its body, emitting a continuous sound of cracking.

"Boom..." The second stone statue collapsed with a thunderous crash, turning into a pile of rubble scattered across the ground.

Golden light flickered as Long Jie transformed into human form, his eyes flashing with cold determination. He stood beside Luo Tian.

"Indeed, the flesh of the Dragon Emperor is unmatched!" several people thought in unison, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian and Long Jie.

"Die!" Sun Kainian waved his hands, a pure white screen of light materializing in the sky above. A phantom emerged from Sun Kainian's body.

"What is that? Is there such a martial technique?" the others gazed at the screen in the sky, their lips twitching involuntarily.

Even Luo Tian's face was veined with anger; it was the first time he had seen Sun Kainian employ such a technique.

The white screen enveloped everyone's heads, but upon closer inspection, one would notice it took the shape of an oversized iron spade.

Behind Sun Kainian, the phantom reached for the handle of the spade and slowly raised its arms. With a sweeping motion, it swung the iron spade down upon countless skeletons.

Though the phantom had once seemed imposing, its combination with the iron spade made it appear absurd.

Chapter 1438: The Treasure Basin Appears

With the iron spade forged from Epoch Power, the towering figure repeatedly struck downward. Each skeleton on the ground shattered in pieces, becoming piles of bones before vanishing into the earth.

"One... ten... a hundred thousand..." as each skeleton disintegrated, Sun Kainian had struck for nearly an hour. The ground was eventually filled with piles of bones, which then sank into the earth.

"Ugh..." Sun Kainian exhaled deeply, his phantom shattering behind him before appearing in front of the others.

"You, Old Sun, with a single finger, reduced the techniques of the Primordial Lord to ashes!" Sun Kainian shook his fat face, a look of arrogance on his face as he gazed at Sun Miechen and Zhu Ge Qingtian.

"Damn it, can you show a little more dignity?" Zhuge Jie and others thought bitterly but remained silent.

"Enough!" Luo Tian didn't want to hear Sun Kainian's nonsense any longer. He turned his gaze toward Zhu Ge Qingtian and others, his eyes flashing with cold determination.

"Previously, we all agreed to cooperate, but you stood there watching the spectacle. Please give me an explanation!" Luo Tian didn't wait for their response, his gaze icy as he stared at Zhu Ge Qingtian.

"What do you want? The trouble was caused by Sun Kainian, so he should deal with it himself. That's not wrong, right?" Sun Miechen showed no fear toward Luo Tian and responded boldly.

"Say that again!" Seeing Sun Miechen's boldness, Long Jie's aura surged violently. His eyes brimmed with battle intent as he glared at Sun Miechen.

"What's the point of saying it again? That Sun Kainian is a failure who can't do anything right. I don't understand why you brought this waste along!" Sun Miechen sneered, his gaze on Sun Kainian filled with deep contempt.

"What do you want? We could just part ways! What are you anyway? To us, you're nothing!" Long Jie's eyes flashed with coldness as he rebuked.

"Enough, everyone. This is just the first trial. Don't let minor matters spoil our harmony!" Zhu Ge Qingtian frowned slightly, his gaze sweeping over Luo Tian and the others as well as Sun Miechen.

"Sun Miechen, are you insulting me?" Sun Kainian stood calmly, for the first time showing a serious expression. His aura seemed to change subtly as he gazed at Sun Miechen.

"Huh?" Feeling Sun Kainian's sudden change in aura, he was taken aback. It was the first time he had seen Sun Kainian in such a manner, as if he were a different person.

"Insulting you? What's the difference? A useless thief who only knows how to sneak around. What qualification do you have to stand with us?" Sun Miechen recalled the mockery Sun Kainian had once hurled at him outside the Primordial Palace and dismissed the changed Sun Kainian without a second thought.

"Good! You'll regret it!" Sun Kainian let out a light laugh, his aura gradually subsiding before returning to his usual carefree demeanor.

"Buzz..." As Sun Kainian's words finished, a series of buzzing sounds rose from the area where the stone statues had stood.

"It's here! This is the benefit of passing through, enhancing one's cultivation with Epoch Power!" Zhuge Jie's eyes lit up with a hint of joy. He soared into the air, rushing toward the place where Luo Tian and the others had fought.

A series of grey lights rose from the cracks on the ground, each column radiating powerful Epoch Power. The others' faces gleamed with excitement.

"Absorb it! It's much stronger than hard training!" Zhu Ge Qingtian soared into the air, sitting cross-legged near Zhuge Jie. His body emitted a series of thunderous sounds as a vast expanse of blue sky appeared above his head, beginning to absorb the dense Epoch Power.

"Damn it! We fought so hard while you're just taking it easy!" Long Jie's face turned angry as he roared, a golden dragon coiling above his head and continuously devouring.

"Then let's rely on our own strength!" Sun Miechen's eyes flickered with a hint of amusement. He wasn't about to pass up such an opportunity.

Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao remained silent, but they too soared into the air, sitting cross-legged to begin absorbing.

"I told you, you'll regret it. From now on, no treasures in this place will belong to Sun Miechen, not even your cultivation. This trip into the Primordial Abyss, I'll make you come empty-handed!" Sun Kainian's eyes flashed with cold determination. With a wave of his hands, a pure white treasure basin materialized in his grasp—the same Treasure Basin that had appeared in the region of severing heaven during his previous clash with Luo Tian over the inheritance mark.

"Wail..." As the Treasure Basin formed, a wailing sound echoed from Sun Kainian's hands. A massive suction force radiated outward, sweeping across the heavens in an instant.

The Epoch Power that had been fought over by everyone suddenly erupted, as if drawn by an invisible force. It broke free from their absorption and rushed toward Sun Kainian.

"This is also possible?" Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief, watching the Epoch Power rushing toward Sun Kainian. He marveled at it.

Luo Tian had known that Sun Kainian's Treasure Basin could sense certain treasures, but he hadn't expected it to also absorb Epoch Power.

Sun Kainian sat cross-legged on the ground, his face showing a serious expression as he allowed the flowing Epoch Dragons to enter his body.

"What's going on?" The others who had just sat cross-legged suddenly opened their eyes, their gazes filled with disbelief as they looked at Sun Kainian.

Moments later, their eyes widened in horror. At that moment, numerous Epoch Dragons coiled above Sun Kainian's head, their Epoch Power so dense it was terrifying. Each one rushed into his body.

"Damn it!" Their faces changed instantly, never expecting Sun Kainian to have such a move, stealing everything from them all.

"What is that thing he's holding?" People then noticed the Treasure Basin in Sun Kainian's hands, their eyes filled with shock.

"Is that the legendary Treasure Basin?" Zhu Ge Qingtian's eyes showed a hint of amazement as he gazed at the Treasure Basin before Sun Kainian.

"Why have I never heard of such an absurd thing!" Zhuge Jie's eyes showed amazement, unable to fathom the existence of such an absurd thing.

"The first Epoch Lord was the Heaven-Sundering Lord, the second was the Heaven-Severing Lord, and the third was the God-Demon Lord. The Epoch Lord of our Chaos Domain is the fifth in human history!"

"Then do you know who the fourth Epoch Lord was?" Zhu Ge Qingtian's face showed a trace of reminiscence, as if returning to the era when the Primordial Lord had suppressed the heavens. As a disciple of an Epoch Lord, he obviously knew some secrets that were unknown to others.

Luo Tian and the others shook their heads. The time had passed too long; people only knew that humans had produced several Epoch Lords, but the exact number was unknown. Even ancient texts didn't record it, and no one knew the order of their appearances.

Now people only knew that the Heaven-Sundering Lord and the Heaven-Severing Lord were two titans who had made great contributions to humanity.

"The fourth Epoch Lord was mysterious, as if he had never existed in the world at all. However, my master knew of his existence!"

"Steal Heaven's Lord!" Zhu Ge Qingtian sighed softly, gazing at Sun Kainian, his mind forming some guesses about Sun Kainian's identity.

"Steal Heaven's Lord?" Luo Tian and the others showed confusion, having never heard of such a figure.

"Yes, I also heard about him from my master. He was an unparalleled existence before my master. If it weren't for my master mentioning him, the world might never have known of such an unparalleled existence!" Zhu Ge Qingtian spoke softly.

"Wandering through the great tombs, stealing everything from sacred places!"

"And the most iconic thing of that Steal Heaven's Lord was this Treasure Basin!" Zhu Ge Qingtian gazed at Sun Kainian.

"Most likely, that Steal Heaven's Lord left behind a lineage, but it remained unknown to the world!" Zhu Ge Qingtian spoke softly. His words stirred a storm in everyone's hearts.

Luo Tian was stunned, never expecting Sun Kainian to have such a deep connection with Steal Heaven's Lord. If that Steal Heaven's Lord had wished, he could have revived a sacred domain again.

"That still isn't his justification for stealing my Epoch Power!" Sun Miechen's eyes flashed with cold determination. He rushed toward Sun Kainian, unwilling to let him enhance his strength so easily.

"What are you trying to do!" Luo Tian's face showed coldness, then he闪动 his body and blocked Sun Kainian's path. He punched forward.

"Crack..." Thunder flashed as Luo Tian and Sun Miechen collided. Sun Miechen's body suddenly retreated, his arms marked with streaks of divine patterns before vanishing.

"Sun Miechen, don't be so ungrateful! Since entering this Primordial Abyss, you've been aggressive. Do you think I'm easy to bully? It seems you've forgotten the pain of your past!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He had reached his limit with Sun Miechen, and his aura began to rise. If Sun Miechen pushed further, Luo Tian wouldn't hesitate to tear their relationship apart and give him an unforgettable memory.

"Lo! Are you really going to fight with me over a mere tomb raider!" Sun Miechen's eyes flashed with divine light.

"A mere tomb raider? Zhuge Qingtian has already made it clear that this lineage once had an Epoch Lord. You still call him a tomb raider? That's disrespecting the supreme Epoch Lords!" Luo Tian spoke loudly.

"Also, no matter who he is, to me, he's my friend Luo Tian. If anyone dares to touch him, they'll have to go through me first!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and the Heaven-Ordaining Thunder Sword appeared in his grasp. A series of cold glows erupted from the sword.

Chapter 1439: Entering...

"Luo Tian! I've long wanted to fight you. Let me see if you're still the same Luo Tian!" Sun Miechen's eyes flashed with battle intent. He waved his hand, and a golden long sword appeared in his grasp.

"Are you afraid? Back then I could crush you under my feet, and now I can still crush you!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He held the Heaven-Ordaining Thunder Sword and rushed toward Sun Miechen.

"Kill!" Sun Miechen's eyes flashed with brilliant light. From the start, he had been holding back, and for years, his greatest regret was not having avenged his defeat at Luo Tian's hands.

Two long swords clashed instantly, their robes fluttering as they locked eyes before darting apart.

Two streaks of light flashed, and in an instant, they rushed toward each other again.

"Enough you two!" Just as they were about to clash again, a cold scoff echoed out. The voice carried authority, and grey mist surged as Zhu Ge Qingtian's cold face appeared between them.

With hands filled with grey mist, he grabbed both long swords and pushed outward with force. A wave of energy surged.

"Huh?" Luo Tian and Sun Miechen's eyes narrowed slightly, gazing at the figure standing between them, whose aura was overwhelming.

Zhu Ge Qingtian's face had lost its previous smile. He stood like a tyrant, his eyes deep and blood flowed from his hands, staining the swords of Luo Tian and Sun Miechen.

"I don't care about your grudges here. What's needed is cooperation, at least to pass the third trial. After three trials, if you want to fight and kill each other, I won't stop you. In fact, I might even join your battle!"

"But before that, I hope you don't tear each other apart!" Zhu Ge Qingtian spoke coldly, his voice carrying霸道. He was no longer the kind-hearted person he had been before.

"What if we tear each other apart!" Sun Miechen's face showed a cold smile, facing Zhu Ge Qingtian, an Epoch Late-stage master of the Chaos Domain. The divine sword emitted a series of divine glows, and he had drawn it from Zhu Chaos's hands. He spoke coldly but his eyes showed intense fear.

Thunder flashed, and Luo Tian also retreated, gazing at Zhu Ge Qingtian with a serious expression. He was shocked by Zhu Ge Qingtian's strength.

Luo Tian and Sun Miechen's attacks, although with the intention of testing each other, were not something anyone could easily withstand. Especially facing both attacks at once, even Zhuge Jie couldn't manage it.

Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao stood by, their eyes fixed on Zhu Ge Qingtian, silently admiring his strength.

"The disciple of the Primordial Lord is truly变态!" Zhou Wei sighed softly, then a smile appeared on his face. "Everyone came here for the purpose of enhancing their strength. As for clashing, it's better to leave it outside the Primordial Abyss. Don't forget, this is one of the Nine Desolate Lands!"

"I can clearly tell you that my master's arrangement was specifically for me. The third trial requires nine people to work together; one missing is not allowed. If anyone doesn't want to go deeper, they can choose to withdraw. I'll have others from the Chaos Domain come instead!" Zhu Ge Qingtian's eyes carried a threatening expression as he spoke to Luo Tian and Sun Miechen.

Hearing Zhu Ge Qingtian's words, Luo Tian fell silent. He had come here for the purpose of obtaining the Magnetic Light of Immortals and to check if Gu Qianxue and the other three women had been mistakenly transported into this Primordial Abyss by the Thunder Domain's transmission array. These two matters were the most important.

"The final inheritance struggle will inevitably be a fight to the death, so we can fight then! For now, our goal is to reach the inheritance site my master left for me!" Zhu Ge Qingtian spoke softly, his gaze scanning over the others.

"Good! But only if no one provokes us!" Luo Tian glanced at Sun Miechen, his eyes cold as he spoke.

"I don't oppose it!" Sun Miechen was obviously here for the inheritance of the Primordial Lord. Although he wanted to fight Luo Tian, he ultimately held back. As Zhu Ge Qingtian had said, they would all fight in the final struggle. It was better to wait until then. Moreover, from what he had seen, Zhu Ge Qingtian was the biggest enemy in their struggle for inheritance.

"Buzz..." A series of buzzing sounds echoed behind Luo Tian, and Sun Kainian slowly stood up, his eyes filled with mockery.

"This is the first one!" Sun Kainian spoke softly, gazing at Sun Miechen with a provoking look.

"You!" Sun Miechen's face flashed with coldness, but recalling the previous agreement, he let out a cold snort and said nothing.

"Enough! Let's continue moving!" Zhu Ge Qingtian returned to his kind-hearted demeanor, speaking to the others and leading them forward again.

In the grey mist, Luo Tian and his companions walked along a somewhat rugged path toward the depths of the Primordial Abyss.

As Luo Tian and his companions walked deeper into the Primordial Abyss, in the depths of the Thunder Domain's lightning sea marshes, a massive crack spread through the turbulent lightning sea, emitting an atmosphere that made people's hearts tremble.

"What's happening? Why hasn't Fuxingyue returned yet?" A group of figures stood in the lightning sea, gazing at the other side of the lightning sea and murmuring.

Numerous figures seemed to submerge the entire lightning sea, their eyes filled with excitement as they gazed at the massive crack.

"Is this the entrance to the Nine Domains? This time, we owe it to the Star Moon Divine Clan!" A group of elders with overwhelming power stood at the front, addressing Fu Wenbin and the others.

"Everyone, this sealed entrance was indeed opened by the Star Moon Divine Clan. However, I advise everyone not to act recklessly. There might be strong figures among humans!" Fu Wenbin spoke to the crowd.

These people were the Epoch Peak masters of other royal clans, and they had all appeared at the Star Moon Divine Clan, obviously coming for the entrance to the Nine Domains.

For years, the ancient royal clans had been sealed within the Origin Domain, and almost all of them harbored great hatred toward humanity.

"Yes, Elder Fu, we from the Feather Clan remember this. Once we enter the Nine Domains, let's work together. No matter what grudges we have, we'll deal with exterminating humanity later!" An elder with twelve pairs of golden wings smiled and spoke to Fu Wenbin.

"Yes, let's exterminate humanity first. However, it would be better to plan carefully," Fu Wenbin nodded slightly, thinking about the previous world-shaking immortal light. This was why the Star Moon Divine Clan had not entered the Nine Domains yet.

"Let's enter this lightning domain now, occupy it, and observe the strength of humanity. If they're not strong enough, we'll exterminate them immediately!" Several Epoch Peak masters of the royal clans discussed for a while before their eyes flashed with cold determination.

"Go!" More than ten Epoch Peak masters roared, their bodies surging into the sky and shattering the thunder before stepping into the sealed domain.

"Roar..." A roar echoed through the sky, and a group of people from the Tiangu Clan rushed like locusts, their terrifying thunderous sounds vanishing under this roar.

A series of roars filled with endless anger echoed, and for so many years, the mighty ancient royal clans had been sealed within the Origin Domain across several epochs.

Each of the ancient royal clan members had red eyes, their powerful killing intent echoing through the vast lightning sea marshes and gradually spreading throughout the Nine Domains.

The entire Nine Domains trembled with this roar, and all the sacred domains and clans were shaken. They felt the earth-shattering killing sound and trembled in fear.

All of the Nine Domains' Epoch Treasures emitted a series of thunderous sounds, as if resisting this overwhelming killing sound. It seemed they had encountered an unprecedented enemy and were warning humanity.

At the old site of the Thunder Domain's Han Tian Continent, Li Tianzhi, who had just restored his physical body, looked at the humming Zhen Tian Wheel above him with a grim expression.

The entire Thunder Domain was in chaos, and all the大大小小势力 trembled. As the closest force to the lightning sea marshes, they felt this trembling more deeply than anyone else.

"Quickly go!" Li Tianzhi had no time to think, then he闪动 his body and carried the still dazed Ren Hongzhe into the air. The Zhen Tian Wheel suddenly expanded, lifting the entire Snow Dragon Mountain and flying toward the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Li Tianzhi had no choice but to do this. This roar was too sudden, and although Luo Tian had previously told them to unify the Thunder Domain first, he had just restored his physical body and had no time at all. He could feel an overwhelming force that he couldn't resist, spreading from the lightning sea marshes and capable of destroying the entire Nine Domains. No sacred domain could withstand this force's crushing pressure.

"Nine Domains, your true masters have returned!" As Li Tianzhi and the Snow Dragon Mountain flew out of the Thunder Domain, a cold voice echoed beneath the stars of the Thunder Domain, making the people in the Thunder Domain tremble even more.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." As the voice fell, all the cultivators refining their bodies outside the lightning sea were instantly destroyed, turning into clouds of blood and floating beneath the lightning sea.

More than ten Epoch Peak masters stepped out from the lightning sea, gazing at the stars of the Thunder Domain with expressions of excitement. They then roared into the sky.

Stars vanished, and a powerful aura radiated from the ten elders, spreading outward invisibly.

"This Thunder Domain is just the beginning, children. Eliminate all these lowly humans!" A clan elder of the Blood Clan spoke loudly to the group of ancient royal clans that had already rushed out.

Chapter 1440: The Second Trial

Like the end of the world, countless fierce ancient royal clans emerged from the lightning sea marshes, their overwhelming auras rushing toward every corner of the Thunder Domain.

"Run!" The大大小小 forces in the Thunder Domain trembled, unable to resist the overwhelming auras of the ancient royal clans. They abandoned their teachings and fled toward other star domains, seeking protection from sacred domains.

Chaos erupted throughout the Thunder Domain as the sudden appearance of the ancient royal clans left many forces unable to escape, being annihilated by them.

"Haha! The taste of human blood is truly exquisite!" Some bloodthirsty races, after exterminating countless great sects, directly devoured the humans as food.

"In ancient times, humans were our food!" Roars echoed, and the entire Thunder Domain turned into a hellish scene. Bloodstained air spread everywhere, with people dying every moment.

More than ten Epoch Peak masters personally intervened, cutting through the stars and sealing the entire Thunder Domain. They wouldn't allow humans to escape from the Thunder Domain.

The Nine Domains trembled, and everyone, including the sacred domains, was tense. Each sacred domain sent their strength toward the Thunder Domain's direction to see how terrifying the ancient royal clans were.

However, when those strength returned with what they saw, all sacred domains fell silent.

More than ten Epoch Peak masters made people feel despair. Even though the sacred domains had strengthened over the years, they could only remain silent before more than ten Epoch Peak masters and dared not rescue. Even their own strong crisis was felt.

"So soon!" On the divine mountain of the Divine Clan, Sun Miechen had entered the Chaos Domain. The emergence of the ancient royal clans directly awakened Elder God King Sun Shengtian, who took charge of the divine clan's affairs.

Not only the Divine Clan, but other domains' elders also emerged from their meditation states.

"So close! If only I had ten more years, I could have reached the Epoch Peak!" In the vast dragon tomb of the Demon Domain, Diao Yuanshan walked out with a grim face, his eyes filled with regret.

Diao Yuanshan knew that even an Epoch Peak master couldn't change much, but if combined with the Demon Domain's strong foundation, it could at least protect itself against the ancient royal clans.

"What to do!" The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains were also anxious, standing there and gazing at the Thunder Domain. At this moment, Li Tianzhi had arrived in the Four Sacred Star Domains and explained the situation of the Thunder Domain to its people. The entire Five Elements Mountain was filled with deep fear.

"More than ten Epoch Peak masters are beyond our ability to resist, and no domain can withstand them. The immediate priority is to unite with other domains and find a solution!" As the only Epoch Peak master, Xuan Bing Old Ancestor sighed softly.

The Seven Star Island had once been stationed in the Origin Domain and deeply understood the terrifying nature of the ancient royal clans. Once a蛮族 had made the Seven Star Island afraid to appear in the Origin Domain, let alone the combined forces of the ancient royal clans. Although they hadn't fully entered the Nine Domains, they were still a desperate force.

The elders of the Nine Domains, Diao Yuanshan, Sun Shengtian, Zhu Chaos and others all left their sacred domains, stepping onto the transmission arrays to enter the Four Sacred Star Domains. They knew that now, only the Four Sacred Star Domains had one Epoch Peak master.

"Humanity, we claim this Thunder Domain. If you want to reclaim it, come and fight!" The more than ten Epoch Peak masters of the ancient royal clans spoke loudly, their voices spreading throughout the Nine Domains.

"The Thunder Domain is yours to take, but please release the humans within it and coexist peacefully with us!" The sacred domains united in the Four Sacred Star Domains spoke, causing people throughout the Nine Domains to worry. The once strong sacred domains now used a negotiating tone toward the ancient royal clans.

"Haha, you still have your servile nature. After slaughtering the Thunder Domain, it's your human Epoch Lords who will suppress us ancient royal clans!" A laugh echoed through the Thunder Domain, its voice strong and unyielding, completely disregarding the sacred domains' response.

"We don't want to be enemies with the ancient royal clans. We hope you will act wisely!" The human sacred domains responded, but their strength was pale in people's ears.

Bloodthirsty slaughter lasted for seven days, and the entire Thunder Domain was surrounded by blood. No human remained alive.

When the冥域 attacked the Thunder Domain before, humans could flee to the lightning sea marshes. But now there was nowhere to run; everyone was slaughtered, and the entire Thunder Domain was completely controlled by the ancient royal clans.

After capturing the Thunder Domain, the ancient royal clans did as they had planned and didn't attack other domains. They needed to probe the strength of other domains before giving humanity a devastating blow.

"From today, no human is allowed to enter the Thunder Domain. Anyone who does will die!" The ancient royal clans declared boldly, leaving no room for negotiation.

"What to do now?" At this moment, Diao Yuanshan, Sun Shengtian, Yan Hongtao, Zhu Chaos, and the Demon Lord stood with grim faces, gazing at Xuan Bing Old Ancestor.

"We can't resist them; you don't know the terror of the ancient royal clans. Even with our Epoch Treasures, they also have Royal Weapons and are fearless against us!" Xuan Bing Old Ancestor sighed deeply.

"They won't attack us immediately, but they will eventually eye us. We must be on guard. Now, we can't match them directly unless a准 Epoch Lord appears to intimidate them. But where would we find such a figure!" Diao Yuanshan spoke, his voice filled with helplessness.

"There's no way around it; we must try not to expose our strength. I believe they are also wary of us and won't attack recklessly!" Sun Shengtian spoke, his gaze serious. His aura surged, clearly showing he was just one step away from the Epoch Peak.

"We should unite and enter a desolate land once, perhaps we can enhance our strength!" The old domain master of the Star-Seeking Domain, Zhou Guangzu, spoke softly.

"Right now, Luo Tian and the others have entered the Primordial Abyss. If we don't stay to guard, who will deal with these royal clans!" However, they shook their heads shortly after.

"Old Zhou, give Luo Tian and the others a fortune reading. See if they can significantly enhance their strength after leaving this domain, thus resolving this human crisis!" The others gazed at Zhou Guangzu, showing some hope in his divination skills.

"I can't read it. Luo Tian and Sun Miechen are both divine bodies, their blood and qi soaring high, favored by heaven. I can't read it either. Moreover, the Primordial Abyss is different from other places; even Epoch Lords must be cautious when entering the Nine Desolate Lands. The heavenly omens of the Nine Desolate Lands are all obscured!" Zhou Guangzu shook his head gently.

"Alas..." The old men sighed deeply, their voices filled with worry. Although the ancient royal clans wouldn't attack immediately, some minor harassment would still exist. They were worried that these small frictions might escalate.

"Try our best, prepare for a fight to the death, and enhance our strength as much as possible, just like when we fought against the Nine Saints of the冥域!" Diao Yuanshan spoke, his voice filled with bitterness.

Back then, one Epoch Peak master had destroyed the resources of several sacred domains. Now with more than ten Epoch Peak masters, how could they resist?

"This is a matter of life and death. I think we should try to negotiate with the ancient royal clans, bringing our Epoch Treasures along. They might not be able to withstand us!" Yan Xiuluo spoke, his voice deep and solemn.

"It's a good idea. Epoch Treasures are also a significant deterrent. The ancient royal clans' foundation is in the Origin Domain, so perhaps they won't bring out their Royal Weapons this time!" The others discussed and then left.

On the other hand, Luo Tian and his companions were completely unaware of external events as they traversed the Primordial Abyss for several days, finally reaching the second trial left by the Primordial Lord.

The ground gradually became a stone path, with grey mist rising from it, causing Zhuge Jie to stop.

"We've arrived!" Zhuge Jie's face was serious as he spoke to Luo Tian and the others, gazing at the high platform built on the stones ahead.

"Finally, someone has come!" As Luo Tian and his companions just stopped, a deep voice echoed from the platform. Then, a thunderous sound rang out from the platform.

A red light flickered and transformed into a phantom old man, floating on the platform with his gaze fixed on Luo Tian and the others.

After scanning over Luo Tian and the others, the phantom old man focused his gaze on Zhu Ge Qingtian.

"Sleeping for so long, I've finally waited for you!" The phantom old man smiled slightly and spoke to Zhu Ge Qingtian.

"Come on, defeat me, and you can proceed to the next trial!" The old man spoke, then his phantom hand reached out into the void and grabbed.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed, and the massive platform shattered into pieces, floating in front of the old man.

In an instant, the pieces of stone converged toward the old man, continuously covering his body until a thousand-zhang-tall stone giant stood before Luo Tian and the others. The massive body carried a heavy aura, exerting immense pressure on Luo Tian and his companions.

"Let's fight together! This stone giant's strength is Epoch Late-stage, but its defense is even stronger than the previous stone statues!" Zhu Ge Qingtian闪动 his body, forming a grey long sword in his hand. He slashed downward at the stone giant conjured by the old man.

Chapter 1441: The Stone Giant

The grey long sword carried an overwhelming might, slashing downward and striking the stone giant's body. Sparks flew everywhere, sliding down from top to bottom.

"What in the world is this!" The others standing there immediately changed faces, as Zhu Ge Qingtian's attack at Epoch Late-stage had only left a shallow scratch on the stone giant.

"This is Primordial Stone, leftover from when my master forged the Primordial Bell!" Zhu Ge Qingtian spoke, explaining what the stone giant was composed of, his eyes filled with seriousness.

"Is this attack worthy of being your master's disciple?" A deep voice echoed from the stone giant, making Zhu Ge Qingtian's face immediately turn grim.

"This is just the beginning!" Zhu Ge Qingtian showed a defiant expression, then his body surged into the sky again. He transformed into a streak of black light, and the grey long sword expanded dramatically, as if splitting open the heavens. It thundered downward toward the stone giant.

"Attack!" Zhuge Jie and Zhu Ge Huangchao simultaneously闪动 their bodies, rushing toward the stone giant. Their bodies emitted a series of thunderous sounds as they凝聚 powerful attacks in their hands.

"Kill!" The others present were all top-tier talents, and seeing Zhu Ge Qingtian couldn't harm the stone giant, they knew it was definitely a formidable opponent.

"Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram!" Sun Miechen raised his hand, and divine light flashed. The Divine Clan's great technique erupted, sending the Nine Heavens Diagram with a heavy pressure toward the stone giant.

"I can too!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, and with a thunderous sound, the massive Divine Diagram fell down, its might overwhelming. It was even more astonishing than Sun Miechen's Nine Heavens Diagram.

"Damn it!" Sun Miechen looked at Luo Tian's Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram, his eyes filled with displeasure. Luo Tian using it in front of him clearly exposed his wounds.

"True Dragon's Battle of the Nine Heavens!"

"Starlight Illuminates the Blue Heaven!"

"Shura's Slash!" Long Jie, Zhou Wei, and Yan Hongtao all launched their attacks without hesitation. They didn't hold back, using killing techniques with terrifying pressure that shook the heavens. Each technique carried a world-destroying might, and anyone at Epoch Mid-stage would have to be cautious.

A terrifying storm swept over the stone giant's body, instantly engulfing it in the sight of everyone.

"How is it?" Luo Tian and the others gazed with deep intensity, hoping their combined efforts would inflict some damage.
