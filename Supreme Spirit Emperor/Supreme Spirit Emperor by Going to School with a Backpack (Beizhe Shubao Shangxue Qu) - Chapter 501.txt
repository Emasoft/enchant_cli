“Hear that these six individuals once resented Luo Tian, intending to chastise him. Yet they met such a fate!” A disciple of the Heaven Dragon Sect murmured, and the cause and outcome of the incident spread swiftly among the crowd.

“Too outrageous! How can such a person be our sect’s master?” The disciples erupted in fury, their emotions stoked.

Luo Tian observed coldly. At this moment, he appeared to the crowd like a villain—a malefactor who had slain his own brethren.

“Something’s amiss!” Luo Tian suddenly realized that although he had left the Heaven Dragon Tomb, he had also left behind certain measures to protect these six individuals. How could they have died?

“Terrified to death? That’s impossible! A cultivator dying of fear—no one would believe it!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with comprehension.

“Undoubtedly, after I left the Heaven Dragon Tomb with Qian Xue and Sun Kelnian, someone else entered. It must be the Ghost Blade’s doing. We disturbed the blade, and its original owner discovered us, seeing these six individuals!”

“Xue Changshan is the Ghost Blade’s original owner!” Luo Tian’s mind raced, piecing together the events.

Yet he did not reveal himself. This was merely his speculation. Even if he stepped forward, no one would believe him—without proof, these people were merely trying to frame him. Once he explained it clearly, there would be another accusation. To smear a person’s name was always easy.

“What does Elder Xue plan to do with me?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a sneer, his gaze sweeping over the other senior elders.

“Revoke your cultivation and expel you from the sect! This is only because of your past contributions to the sect!” One senior elder spoke, his voice laced with coldness.

“Indeed! Such a treacherous and vicious person—how dare he remain in the Heaven Dragon Sect!” Another elder echoed loudly, and the disciples around them nodded in agreement.

Three wolves make a tiger; ten thousand people’s accusations—this was Luo Tian’s predicament, darkening his face.

“Ha! To revoke my cultivation and expel me—by what right?”

“To revoke my years of toil? By what right do you dare?” Luo Tian’s face bore disdain.

“I shall see who dares to revoke your cultivation!” Xuan Dan spoke boldly, standing by Luo Tian’s side no matter what.

“Master, if you give the word, we shall subdue Xuan Dan and expel this scoundrel from the sect!” One senior elder spoke, knowing Li Changfeng would agree. After all, the scene of Luo Tian killing Ke Zhenghao was witnessed by all—no one could bear to see their direct disciple slain.

“Very well, I declare…”

“Grandmaster! If you don’t speak, I shall renounce the Heaven Dragon Sect!” Before Li Changfeng could finish his declaration, Luo Tian shouted loudly.

“Ha! Did you think yourself something special? To even dare call upon Master Yunfei!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s outburst, the crowd scoffed.

“Though we do not know your connection to Master Yunfei, if our three senior elders disagree, even he would grant us this courtesy!” The elders’ faces twisted into sneers.

“Luo Tian is innocent! I can attest to this. Let this matter end here—Luo Tian’s loyalty to the sect is unquestionable. These six deaths have nothing to do with him!” But as the crowd sneered, a solemn voice echoed through the Heaven Dragon Sect.

“Grandmaster himself has come to vouch for this scoundrel!” All faces shifted, including the senior elders’—their gazes toward Luo Tian now carried a different weight.

“Continue the challenge!” Yunfei Grandmaster spoke again, offering no explanation; his single word was enough.

“Ha! All a misunderstanding!” One senior elder laughed, shifting from his earlier coldness to address Luo Tian.

“Indeed! We have seen Luo Tian’s strength. This matter is settled!” The other two elders quickly echoed.

“Such a grandmaster and Xuan Dan—both stand by Luo Tian’s side. A fool would persist in seeking trouble!” The three men resolved within their hearts.

“This…” Xue Changshan and Li Changfeng’s faces darkened momentarily before they gazed at Luo Tian, stunned by the rapid reversal.

“I…” Xue Changshan began, but a tremor rippled through the sky above the Heaven Dragon Sect.

“The Earth Dragon Sect has arrived to pay homage!”

“The Iron Dragon Sect has arrived to pay homage!” Two cold voices echoed from the heavens, drawing all eyes upward. Li Changfeng’s gaze narrowed sharply.

Above, two groups stood—each with twenty or thirty members, their auras fierce and eyes cold.

“Sima Xiu, Peng Tiande! The masters of the Earth Dragon and Iron Dragon Sects!”

“Moreover, their True Immortal elites have arrived. Are they coming to attack us?” The Heaven Dragon Sect’s disciples stirred in alarm, eyeing the figures above.

“Sima Xiu, Peng Tiande—what brings you to our Heaven Dragon Sect?” Li Changfeng’s face darkened, his gaze fixed on the figures above.

“Nothing of consequence—just seeking a person!” Sima Xiu spoke softly, scanning the Heaven Dragon Sect before his eyes landed on Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian! Step forward and fight!” From the Iron Dragon Sect, a burly man strode forth, his gaze sweeping over the Heaven Dragon Sect’s disciples.

“Seeking Luo Tian? How has he offended so many?” The Heaven Dragon Sect’s disciples were astonished, assuming the two sects had come for revenge.

“Those three old men are ruthless!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, surprised at their directness.

Yet he soon understood—these three masters were unrivaled within their sects, and they sought only a reason to convince the masses. That reason was Luo Tian; what better proof than fists? If you disbelieve, fight until submission!

Chapter 1931: Battle Against All Enemies

“Who is Luo Tian? Dare to step forward!” The Earth Dragon Sect’s side continued, their voices rising as two groups stood in the sky.

“I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, his gaze sweeping over the figures above. Due to Zhang Jinghuan’s death, the Heaven Dragon Sect’s elite strength was slightly inferior to the other two sects.

“Fool, come fight!” Upon seeing Luo Tian step forward, the Earth Dragon and Iron Dragon Sects unleashed several beams of divine light, their gazes sweeping over Luo Tian.

“Hmph! A few True Immortals at the initial stage—showing off!” Diaodezhu perched on Luo Tian’s shoulder, lazily spoke.

“Who are you?” Upon hearing Diaodezhu’s words, the descending figures grew furious, eyeing the creature on Luo Tian’s shoulder.

“You! A few True Immortals at the initial stage dare to show off? Do you think no one in the Lower Heavens can deal with you?” Diaodezhu replied, still disdainful.

“Unexpectedly, your pet is so arrogant!” The crowd’s aura surged, their eyes burning toward Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian! To become my Iron Dragon Sect’s master, first ask me Zhao Tiechui!” The burly man who had spoken first stepped forward.

As Luo Tian prepared to fight, his eyes flickered, turning toward Li Changfeng: “Master, these two sects have overstepped. Won’t you intervene?”

Luo Tian’s words caused a brief pause, and all eyes turned to Li Changfeng.

“Sima Xiu, Peng Tiande—your actions are indeed excessive. Do you think the Heaven Dragon Sect is a place for such intrusion?” Li Changfeng’s face darkened, his voice sharp as he rebuked the two.

“What harm is there? Perhaps we’ll come often!” Sima Xiu shook his head lightly, then turned to Luo Tian.

“Fool, don’t play tricks. Our Grandmaster doesn’t know what you’ve drugged him with, but he’s named you as our sect’s junior master. Let us fight—show me how you’ll die with one slap, then we’ll depart!” A burly man spoke.

“What?” Upon hearing the man’s words, the crowd gasped in shock, even Li Changfeng’s eyes widened. They turned to Luo Tian.

“Did your Grandmaster also say this?” Sima Xiu, Peng Tiande, and Li Changfeng exchanged glances before speaking in unison.

They then turned their gazes to Luo Tian, who stood with a smile.

“Three Grandmasters are up to something—issuing such an order!” Li Changfeng and the others felt it was unusual.

“My heavens! The three sects’ Grandmasters have declared Luo Tian as their junior master!” Everyone was stunned, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian.

“Never mind what nonsense—kill this fool and everything will be resolved!” The two sects’ disciples spoke at once, unwilling to let a Heaven Dragon Sect disciple be their master.

“Correct! If three Grandmasters are involved, anyone may challenge Luo Tian. Defeat him and this matter ends!”

“Defeating this fool would suffice, then the Grandmasters won’t interfere!” The two sects’ prodigies and potential masters spoke loudly, their gazes toward Luo Tian now hostile.

“So many…” Luo Tian was momentarily stunned, gazing deeply at the back mountain before pondering.

“Too abrupt. Even if I defeated them all, the three sects would appear unified on the surface but remain divided in heart. After conquering the Upper Heavens, they would still fracture. This is not what Luo Tian desires. If he simply wished to enter the Middle Heavens, joining Star River Prefecture would suffice.

Luo Tian sought a power—vast and growing, like the Tianyuan Continent, eventually becoming the dominion of the Nine Realms. His alliance with this power was essential.

After all, Luo Tian knew his ultimate enemy was the Immortal King and the Immortal Mountains. Without a formidable power, he could not抗衡 with the Immortal Mountains. Unless his strength alone could annihilate them.

Another reason for seeking a power was to find his friends. Though he had found Diaodezhu and others, his wives remained missing. Luo Tian guessed the Middle Heavens would have far more people than the Lower Heavens, and he was certain to meet old friends. A power would help gather them.

The three sects’ merger was Luo Tian’s best choice. After merging, the three forces would inevitably restructure, but the process was complex.

“Come forth! Who dares to fight me?” Luo Tian stood on the arena, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. His battle spirit was fierce—anyone below True Immortal could be his opponent!

“Foolish brat, I’ll show you the Heaven Dragon Sect’s top prodigy!” Luo Tian’s words had barely finished when several figures leapt forth, standing opposite him. Yet their faces were youthful.

“…”

“Truly seeking death…” The Heaven Dragon Sect’s disciples sneered.

These youths appeared strong, but they had witnessed Luo Tian crush the Heavenly Immortal peak Shen Guozhi. The strongest among them was only a late-stage Heavenly Immortal—no match for Luo Tian.

Yet the Heaven Dragon Sect’s disciples did not object; though they had once disdained Luo Tian, now they saw him as a disciple of their sect. Killing the other two sects’ disciples would be a victory for the Heaven Dragon Sect.

“Is that all?” Luo Tian’s face bore disdain; these few youths did not even stir his desire to fight.

“You underestimate us! One of us could easily finish you!” The youths spoke loudly.

“Leave, you brats!” Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande’s faces shifted slightly, barking at them. They had not forgotten how Luo Tian had subdued Zhao Tiancheng and Zhao Tiecheng in the Chaos Sect.

At this moment, Zhao Tiancheng and Zhao Tiecheng had arrived but did not rush forward with the youths.

“I declare this: let all Heavenly Immortal late-stage warriors come forth! No need to waste time!”

“If any True Immortal elder wishes to spar, they may restrict their strength to the half-True Immortal stage. I Luo Tian will accept!”

“But from now on, those who challenge me shall die!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold. He knew he must spill blood, for killing was the best deterrent. He also knew the three Grandmasters would allow him to kill.

“Arrogant…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the two sects’ disciples erupted in fury. Especially the youths who had been angry before, their gazes burning toward Luo Tian.

“I shall end you!” The next moment, a youth leapt into the air, rushing toward Luo Tian with a grey longsword materializing in his hand.

“Trouble…” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, not dodging as he transformed into a blur and rushed toward the youth.

“Crack…” Before people could react, the youth’s body was hurled backward, his grey longsword shattering into invisible winds that swept across the arena.

“Crack…” Luo Tian directly hurled the youth, who flew like a broken kite, spitting blood as he was thrown back.

“Whirr…” Luo Tian’s foot surged with wind, his form vanishing again. A gust of wind swept the arena as he appeared before the retreating youth, grabbing his neck with a single hand.

“A Heavenly Immortal mid-stage dares to speak of killing me? A joke!” Luo Tian’s fingers tightened, and under the crowd’s shock, he snapped the youth’s neck.

“One last chance: those who challenge me shall come to the arena. Those who do not challenge may leave—be ready to die!” Luo Tian’s cold voice brought the crowd back to their senses. The speed of his killing was too fast.

“Let’s all fight! He can’t be a match for us all!” The youths clearly did not believe Luo Tian could withstand them, their bodies glowing with radiant light as they rushed toward him.

“Elder Brother, I’ll handle them! You go deal with the old ones!” Before Luo Tian could move, Chen Zhanbiao’s thunderous voice echoed through the crowd. His massive form blocked Luo Tian’s path.

“This big fellow is also a ruthless one!” The crowd murmured, eyeing Chen Zhanbiao and recalling his brutality.

“Right! All right!” Luo Tian nodded to Chen Zhanbiao, knowing his strength could handle these few.

“Kill!” Upon receiving Luo Tian’s approval, Chen Zhanbiao growled, his eyes flashing excitement. He did not wait for their consent before rushing toward the youths. Until today, Chen Zhanbiao had maintained his habits—eating and fighting, unchanged.

“Now it’s your turn, old men! Come forth!” Luo Tian swept his gaze over the two sects’ elders. These individuals included late-stage Heavenly Immortals and peak Heavenly Immortals, with the two sects totaling over twenty.

“Arrogant fool! I’ll show you your limits!” A middle-aged man from the Iron Dragon Sect stepped forward, his gaze cold as he faced Luo Tian.

“I advise you to fight together!” Luo Tian leapt into motion, his body transforming into a blur as he appeared before Zhao Tianhong.

“Die!” Zhao Tianhong’s face twisted into a sneer, launching a punch toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 1932: Overpowering Two Sects

“Crack!” A crisp sound echoed. This time, Luo Tian did not crush Zhao Tianhong as he had with Shen Guozhi. After all, the Iron Dragon Sect’s body was no easy task, and Zhao Tianhong was a peak Heavenly Immortal.

Luo Tian took several steps back, and Zhao Tianhong also retreated, his eyes wide with disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Beware! This brat’s body is truly abnormal!” Peng Tiande spoke to the Iron Dragon Sect members, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Again!” Zhao Tianhong roared, transforming into a human dragon as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Die!” This time, Luo Tian aimed to end the fight swiftly. He waved his hand, and the Zhenxian Brush emerged. His gaze was cold as golden characters of “兵” (army) descended, directly crushing Zhao Tianhong.

“Boom!” Zhao Tianhong’s body collapsed onto the ground, never to rise again.

“Supreme-grade artifact—the Zhenxian Brush! Despicable, using a supreme-grade artifact!” The others shouted in anger.

“Nonsense! Is it not despicable to fight a peak Heavenly Immortal with a late-stage one?” Luo Tian’s hand moved again, sending out terrifying waves. The crowd’s faces shifted.

“Fight together!” They felt the Zhenxian Brush’s waves and knew that if they did not unite, none could match Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian Senior Brother is so strong!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples murmured, their称呼 of Luo Tian changing without notice.

The three sects’ True Immortal elites gazed in horror at the five characters hovering above Luo Tian’s head.

“Huanlong Curse!”

“Huantian Sword Technique!” The two sects’ elites eyes burned with madness, their martial arts striking.

The heavens trembled; the arena’s barrier began to strengthen, flowing with runes that made Li Changfeng and others’ faces shift.

“The barrier has strengthened itself!” Everyone’s faces showed disbelief, unable to perceive the situation within.

“Bing… Lin… Dou… Zhe… Jie…” Five large characters hovered above Luo Tian’s head, their overwhelming aura shaking the heavens and earth.

“Roar…” A grey long dragon surged toward Luo Tian, causing his face to stiffen slightly.

“Soul Technique!” Luo Tian had not expected a soul attack, but he smiled faintly. He silently marveled at the Earth Dragon Sect’s research into soul arts.

“Unfortunately, I am a Soul-Subduing Master!” Luo Tian whispered, his hands pressing into the void. The five characters above his head descended upon the two sects’ elites.

“Mutual destruction!” The crowd was stunned, not expecting Luo Tian to ignore their martial arts and directly target them.

Gazing at the five golden characters, the heavens trembled, collapsing the skies and making everyone’s minds shake.

The Iron Dragon Sect elders who had rushed toward Luo Tian were crushed by the immense pressure, their bodies frozen in place as they gazed at the five golden characters.

“Unite your strength to withstand it!” One elder shouted, his hands moving as a grey barrier suddenly formed.

“He is alone—our soul technique will surely kill him!” Other Earth Dragon Sect elders also spoke, forming barriers.

In an instant, the barriers enveloped them, and a thunderous roar echoed within the barrier.

Meanwhile, the martial arts from the Earth Dragon Sect also descended upon Luo Tian’s front, each specifically targeting his soul. Such attacks would be daunting even for True Immortals; soul attacks were invisible, and Luo Tian could only sense them due to his strong soul.

“Soul as a blade!” Luo Tian roared, a grey soul sword materializing in his hand. He slashed it toward the incoming soul techniques.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sounds echoed around Luo Tian, his body constantly retreating. After all, countering so many soul techniques was exhausting.

“Elder Brother!” Chen Zhanbiao crushed a Heavenly Immortal mid-stage disciple, stepping beside Luo Tian to catch his retreating body.

“Nothing serious!” Luo Tian’s face was pale, but his eyes glowed with light. He gazed at the two sects’ elites surrounded by chaos.

“Crack…” The sound of cracking echoed on the barrier, and those outside the barrier gazed in disbelief.

“What is the result?” Everyone’s minds were puzzled, sensing the barrier’s strength weakening.

“Defeating so many alone—what else could it be but death?” The Earth Dragon and Iron Dragon Sects’ True Immortals and disciples who had not joined the attack wore sneers.

“It’s impossible! Luo Tian Senior Brother’s strength is beyond your comprehension. A peak Heavenly Immortal is but an ant before him!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples spoke loudly.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s status had changed in their minds—representing the Heaven Dragon Sect. Sometimes, disciples could criticize their sect’s flaws, but outsiders’ words were unacceptable!

“Crash… Crash…” The wild waves continuously swept through the barrier, striking Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao’s bodies and the golden cracked barriers. The wild waves passed through the barrier, making those outside even more anxious.

The positions of the two sects’ elites were marked with slowly healing void fractures, bloodstains spreading across the ground.

“Crack…” The sound of cracking echoed as the golden barrier shattered, sending a powerful gust outward.

“The barrier is destroyed!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples’ lips twitched; this was their first time witnessing such a scene.

“That was a barrier capable of resisting the Dan-Subjugation!” Danfeng disciples spoke loudly, knowing its strength.

As the dust settled, two figures stood there—Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao. Opposite them were several disheveled figures, their gazes filled with fear.

“Six dead!” The crowd gazed at the bloodstains on the ground, exclaiming in shock. They stared at Luo Tian—single-handedly defeating so many and killing six, his strength far exceeding their expectations.

“Luo Tian!”

“Invincible!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples roared, their eyes burning toward Luo Tian. What could be more uplifting for morale than this? In the仙界 (immortal realm), strength was worshipped, and Luo Tian’s achievements today would instill safety in the Heaven Dragon Sect disciples.

“Actually, Luo Senior Brother as our sect’s master would be good! Such talent could become a True Immortal in the Middle Heavens soon!”

“I always said Luo Tian Senior Brother’s talent was more than enough for our sect!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples’ faces glowed with fervor as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Luo Senior Brother, I am your loyal follower! Do you remember me?”

“Rubbish! I am the one, Luo Senior Brother! Remember me? I was your Qian Luofeng disciple! I vowed to follow Luo Tian Senior Brother for life!” Two voices echoed from the Earth Dragon Sect, which were Zhang Xiaoxing and Qian Luofeng.

They had been captured by Song Lao and returned to the Earth Dragon Sect, becoming its prodigies. But this time, they had merely come for the spectacle.

“You two shut up!” Sima Xiu heard their shouts and turned green, barking at them.

“Yes…” Zhang Xiaoxing and Qian Luofeng trembled, sensing Sima Xiu’s murderous gaze. They slumped but secretly marveled at their good judgment—having not opposed Luo Tian.

“Damn it, this kid—I yield! He’s truly a变态!” Zhao Tiecheng and Zhao Tiancheng grinned widely, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Kill again!” But Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed once more, his form moving toward the remaining individuals.

“Dare you?” The thirteen figures trembled slightly but still gritted their teeth, rushing toward Luo Tian. They knew Luo Tian must have suffered heavy injuries.

“Stop!” Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande’s faces shifted slightly; if they continued, their sects’ people would be wiped out. They felt Luo Tian’s abundant spiritual energy in his丹田 (cultivation core).

They moved, and the True Immortals behind them suddenly rushed toward the arena. They appeared before the two sects’ elites in an instant.

“What?” Luo Tian halted, his face smiling as he gazed at Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande.

“Master, Elders—we can still fight!” The thirteen figures spoke loudly to Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande, their faces pale.

“Silence!” They barked, gazing at Luo Tian with intense light in their eyes.

“Fool! I don’t submit to you!” Just as they spoke, a deep voice echoed in the crowd. Everyone’s faces shifted slightly.

“Disgraceful!” Upon seeing who spoke, the crowd cursed, their Heaven Dragon Sect disciples glaring at the old man stepping forward.

“Truly embarrassing! A True Immortal initial stage challenging a late-stage Heavenly Immortal!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples spoke without hesitation, their voices like a storm.

“Master, if the Yunfei Grandmaster intervenes, could we wipe out both sects?” One senior elder stood behind Li Changfeng, his face cruel as he whispered to him. Li Changfeng’s face shifted slightly, his eyes flashing with light.

Chapter 1933: Merger

“Useless! Three sects have all declared this kid their junior master. Clearly, the three Grandmasters have their own plans. I suspect the three sects will merge!” Li Changfeng sighed softly, gazing at Luo Tian. After years as the Heaven Dragon Sect’s master, if Li Changfeng could not see through it, he would be unfit for the role.

“Merge!” Upon hearing Li Changfeng’s words, several Heaven Dragon Sect senior elders’ faces shifted slightly, gazing at Luo Tian.

If the merger succeeded, Luo Tian would become the new master of the three sects—what a position!

“This is good for our Heaven Dragon Sect. After all, Luo Tian belongs to us; we may become the leading force!” Li Changfeng spoke softly, his eyes flashing with light.

Li Changfeng’s thoughts were clear to Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande, who also shifted their gazes toward Luo Tian.

“Zhao Tianhong, return!” Sima Xiu barked, signaling the early-stage Heavenly Immortal Zhao Tianhong to return.

“Self-restrict your strength to the half-True Immortal stage, and I can fight you!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice laced with arrogance. At this moment, he truly had the right to fight a half-True Immortal.

“You…” Zhao Tianhong’s face reddened, but he was glared back by Sima Xiu.

“We agree!” Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande spoke in unison, their words causing the Heaven Dragon Sect to fall silent.

“Indeed! My heavens!” The next moment, the Heaven Dragon Sect disciples erupted in shock, their gazes filled with disbelief toward Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande.

The three sects, the absolute masters of the Lower Heavens, had now all acknowledged Luo Tian as their next master. This news would surely shake the Lower Heavens.

“To win the battle for dominance, the three sects have merged!” Someone deduced, exclaiming.

“We three have decided to merge our sects!” As the crowd was stunned beyond belief, three figures stood in the sky, their gazes solemn as they looked down at the people below.

“Respect the Grandmaster!” The sea of people bowed to the three elders.

“The three sects have merged!” Li Changfeng, Sima Xiu, and Peng Tiande had long suspected this but were still stunned by the three Grandmasters’ confirmation.

“Indeed! We have merged. Any one of our sects alone would not have a chance to enter the Middle Heavens!”

“But if we merge into one sect, I have a great chance—over eighty percent! The benefits outweigh the drawbacks!”

“However, merging three mighty sects will inevitably be complicated. If handled poorly, it may weaken all three sects’ strengths.”

“The most important thing is the master’s position. If you let these True Immortal initial stage individuals take it, they would favor their own sects. Thus, we must choose from the newly initiated disciples!”

“We have chosen Luo Tian! His strength you’ve seen. We personally tested him—no one below True Immortal can match him. His future is boundless!”

“Moreover, Xuan Dan’s Dantian Sect will fully support him. He also has a connection with Jiang Huantian, the master of the Illusion Heaven Island, and is a brother to the Star River Prefecture’s junior prefect. In any case, Luo Tian is the best choice!”

“Are you all convinced?” The three Grandmasters spoke in turn, their voices like thunder. Each word caused the Heaven Dragon Sect disciples to gasp.

Li Changfeng, Sima Xiu, and Peng Tiande’s many True Immortals remained silent, their eyes thoughtful.

Xue Changshan’s face bore bitterness; with the three Grandmasters’ words, this matter was likely settled. Zu Qiu Ming had no chance at all.

Among the crowd, True Immortals had the qualifications to enter the Middle Heavens. Yet they did not go alone—everyone knew that having a sect was far better than going solo.

They could also join other sects if they went alone, but it would certainly not be as comfortable as remaining in the Heaven Dragon or Earth Dragon Sects.

“Obey the Grandmaster’s arrangement!” Li Changfeng, Sima Xiu, and Peng Tiande wore respectful expressions, bowing to the three Grandmasters.

“Good!” The three Grandmasters smiled slightly, then turned their gazes to Luo Tian, drawing everyone’s attention.

“Swear an oath: do not act unjustly toward the three sects, nor harm them!” Yunfei Grandmaster spoke softly, his voice solemn.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded, understanding the three’s intent. He leapt into the air, standing atop the sky.

“From today, we three sects merge! From now on, there is no Earth Dragon Sect, Heaven Dragon Sect, or Iron Dragon Sect—only…”

“Shenglong Sect!”

“Luo Tian is our Shenglong Sect’s junior master. When he enters the Middle Heavens and reaches True Immortal initial stage, he shall be our sect’s master!” Yunfei Grandmaster spoke loudly. Afterward, the three Grandmasters exchanged smiles.

“Damn it, they’ve already planned the name!” Luo Tian stood before them, his lips twitching. He had hoped to rename the merged sect as Tianyuan Sect for easier identification.

“Good, everyone return!” The Iron Dragon Sect’s Grandmaster Peijianping spoke loudly, his voice filled with excitement.

“Yes!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples spoke in unison, their voices brimming with excitement. For them, merging three sects was a good thing—things would remain as they were.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian sighed, flying toward his courtyard. But before he could move, the three senior elders detained him.

“Fool! Where are you going? You’re now a junior master!” Yunfei Grandmaster smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Back to cultivate! I’m a junior master, not yet the master!” Luo Tian’s face bore confusion. He did not want to get involved in the merger—without thinking, he knew merging three sects would be exhausting.

“Go discuss the merger! From now on, you three will manage the sect’s affairs. Prioritize the sect!” Yunfei Grandmaster spoke to Li Changfeng and others, then led Luo Tian toward the Heaven Dragon Sect’s back mountain.

“Go! You’re not strangers here!” Li Changfeng gazed at Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande, his eyes carrying a touch of kindness.

“Ha! Master Xuan Dan, we’ve long admired you! We’ll need your guidance in the future!” An elder from the Earth Dragon Sect spoke loudly to Xuan Dan, who was well-known. They had long envied the Heaven Dragon Sect for having Xuan Dan.

The group disappeared into the sky under the Heaven Dragon Sect disciples’ respectful gazes.

“The three sects have merged!” The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples murmured, still in a dreamlike state. This event was too shocking to believe.

“Hum…” The three Grandmasters led Luo Tian to a secluded courtyard, their faces smiling.
