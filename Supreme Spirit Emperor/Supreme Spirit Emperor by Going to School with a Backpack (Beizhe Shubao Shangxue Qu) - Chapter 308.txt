Crimson eyes burst forth with waves of red light. Three mountains crashed down, each inscribed with a vigorous character.

"Sky! Earth! Humanity?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, eyes flickering with confusion. He could not fathom what the enigmatic Heaven's Will was up to.

"Such a situation... I've heard of it before?" Man Hun and Hu Tianzong's faces bore confusion as they gazed at the mountains that obscured the heavens. It felt like something they had seen in ancient records.

"Boom...!" Before Luo Tian could react, the 'Human' mountain suddenly materialized behind him, crushing him into the earth.

"Open!" Luo Tian roared, his legs emitting a crackling sound as he finally stood upright, resisting the mountain's weight.

But in an instant, another thunderous crash echoed as the 'Earth' mountain descended, pinning Luo Tian between it and the 'Human' mountain.

Before anyone could react, the 'Sky' mountain thundered down as well. The three mountains—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—vanished Luo Tian from sight entirely.

Blood trickled from beneath the mountains, causing Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua's faces to pale. A foreboding sense gripped them.

"Is the Deputy Island Master truly dead?" Shen Gong Feichi stared at the golden mountain's bloodstains, which gradually seeped into the ground. His voice trembled.

"It's possible. The success rate of passing through an Epoch Trial is low; otherwise, there wouldn't be so few Epoch-beginners!"

"Hu Tianzong's passage into the Epoch was meticulously prepared by the Seven Star Island, which is why it succeeded!"

"But normally, enduring the 'Sin' character suffices to pass an Epoch Trial. However, Luo Tian's case has changed—each of these three mountains could annihilate any Epoch-beginner, even prodigies!" Yang Jinghua's face darkened as he spoke softly.

"Hah! He overreached, daring to engulf us all in the Heavenly Punishment. Now he's met his end!" Man Hun's face lit up with joy as the golden divine blood dimmed.

"Buzz..." The black storm clouds gradually dissipated, vanishing from sight. People gazed in awe.

"The storm has cleared. The Heavenly Punishment is over. Another human prodigy perished beneath the Epoch Trial!" All murmured in awe. Luo Tian's combat prowess had been formidable, rivaling any royal clan prodigy. Yet now he lay bloodied beneath the trial's wrath.

"He's dead!" Far off, Tu Feiyang and Fu Xingyue watched the black clouds dissipate with grim satisfaction.

"Regret I couldn't personally crush him, preventing the bloodline from entering the Nine Domains!" Tu Feiyang's heart seethed. Luo Tian was a stain on his life.

Not only Tu Feiyang, but Fu Xingyue, Fan Jingyu, and Man Hun felt the same. Four of them had chased a half-Epoch human, only to be driven into retreat—embarrassing beyond measure.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The three mountains shattered, revealing Luo Tian's bloodied flesh as his divinity faded.

"Buzz..." As people marveled at Luo Tian's lack of survival chances, the fading divinity suddenly surged with emerald vitality, hinting at rebirth.

"Blood Rebirth! How could he achieve it in this situation?" Man Hun's eyes widened with disbelief, watching the forming figure.

"Indeed, it shows signs of revival!" Man Jiang and Man Hai stood among the crowd, watching Luo Tian's fragmented body coalesce. They sighed inwardly.

"Let him not survive!" Man Hun snarled, his foot lashing toward the emerging figure.

"Get out of my way!" Hu Tianzong's face flashed coldly as his spear swept across Man Hun's path, eyes burning with fierce determination. Now he no longer feared Man Hun, a royal clan prodigy.

The golden foot clashed with the gray spear, emitting thunderous roars. Both figures recoiled. Hu Tianzong's face flushed slightly before steadying himself, his gaze locking onto Man Hun.

"Damn!" Man Hun's face darkened. He knew Hu Tianzong, now in the Epoch, was a formidable opponent—especially with his terrifying speed.

"Crack..." Purple lightning descended. Hu Tianzong thrust the Zixiao Divine Lotus into Luo Tian's bloodied flesh, infusing it with vitality. Instantly, Luo Tian coalesced into a physical body.

"Epoch-beginner!" Luo Tian's face remained pale, but his eyes blazed with excitement. His pale hand grasped at the void, and the sky twisted as an invisible vortex sucked into his body.

His cultivation surged rapidly, restoring his lost strength.

"Sage Peak... Half-Epoch..." Thunder echoed as Luo Tian's dantian roared. His golden sage energy transformed into white Epoch power.

"Success!" Luo Tian howled, having overcome countless trials to finally enter the Epoch-beginner stage.

"Another prodigy has risen!" Whether giants of the蛮族 or Seven Star Island's people, they gazed at Luo Tian, whose aura was overwhelming.

"Buzz..." Yet as Luo Tian reveled in triumph, waves of energy suddenly surged around him.

The characters 'Heaven,' 'Earth,' and 'Human' coalesced, instantly etched onto Luo Tian's body. His face paled.

"Damn it! Again!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly but activated Epoch power and Dao energy to resist the Heaven's Will.

"Huh?" Yet he soon puzzled, for after the characters were imprinted on him, he felt no discomfort. This intrigued Luo Tian immensely.

"It's not so simple!" Luo Tian's mind tensed, a bad premonition stirring.

"I remember now! It's the Heaven-Man-World Three Declines!" Hu Tianzong's eyes widened, staring at Luo Tian unharmed.

"Heaven-Man-World Three Declines! Yes, I remember now. My heavens, Luo Tian's luck is truly cursed! This could only happen to him!" Yang Jinghua's usually calm face finally shifted, his expression stunned.

"Senior Brother Hu, what is Heaven-Man-World Three Declines?" Shen Gong Fu's face bore concern as he asked. Whatever terrified Hu Tianzong must be terrifying indeed.

"Heaven-Man-World Three Declines—I read about it in ancient texts. Legends say the second human Epoch Master, Jie Tian, once encountered this!"

"Decline means decay. Those who survive an Epoch Trial appear invincible, but their bodies harbor a terrifying power that may erupt at any time. When it does, they become ordinary humans with no cultivation! Or worse, they may wither away entirely!" Hu Tianzong's face darkened as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"But it's not permanent. Human decline lasts a day, Earth decline a year, and Heaven decline ten years. Jie Tian once endured human and earth declines with his unparalleled skills. As for how he passed the Heaven decline, no one knows—those were his weakest times, and no one could know his whereabouts!" Hu Tianzong sighed as he spoke to the group.

At that moment, Luo Tian had flown to Hu Tianzong's side, hearing his words. His face darkened—becoming a commoner would be impossible to survive even in the brutal蛮族 continent, let alone the Nine Domains.

"Heaven-Man-World Three Declines! Hah! When this happens, he'll be a mere ant!" Fu Xingyue spoke coldly.

"No need to wait for the Heaven decline. For now, return and rest. When the Sea's Edge battle comes, we'll deal with this kid. Without the Heavenly Punishment, he's just a strong enemy!" Tu Feiyang's eyes glinted with defiance as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Damn Heaven!" Luo Tian shook his head, staring at the sky with defiance, cursing under his breath.

"Let's not dwell on it now. For now, there's no major issue. We'll deal with the rest later!" Luo Tian smiled faintly, gazing at Man Hun.

"Will you fight again?" Luo Tian's aura brimmed with battle spirit as he clenched his fists.

"No more fights! No more!" Man Hun's heart ached; Luo Tian's side had two Epoch-beginners, while he alone was one. Moreover, the蛮族 had suffered heavy losses, and Man Hun himself bore injuries and exhaustion.

"Then we'll retreat!" Luo Tian addressed Man Hun, his sleeve sweeping as he led Hu Tianzong and others back to the human domain.

"Why don't we seize this advantage and conquer the蛮族?" Hu Tianzong's eyes flickered with confusion, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Stop talking and help me!" Luo Tian's face was calm, but his voice trembled with urgency in Hu Tianzong's mind. His voice was at its weakest.

Chapter 1271: Human Decline Arrives

"What's happening?" Hu Tianzong's face shifted, flying to Luo Tian's side with bewilderment.

Though they had clashed before on the Seven Star Island, their bond of life and death had forged complete trust.

"Could it be..." Hu Tianzong soon realized Luo Tian's aura was deteriorating, his blood seemingly solidifying. He guessed Luo Tian's condition.

"Yes, human decline has arrived. I never expected it to come so fast!" Luo Tian's face bore bitterness as a cold wave enveloped him.

"Leave quickly!" Hu Tianzong knew no time for explanations, urgently transmitting to Yang Jinghua.

"Right!" Yang Jinghua sensed Luo Tian's change and shouted at the human forces behind him, leading them back to their domain.

Throughout the journey, Luo Tian felt his condition deteriorate again. His body was wrapped in coldness, as if frozen by millennia of ice. His dantian's powerful Epoch energy solidified instantly, unable to move.

Worse still, Luo Tian felt not only his cultivation but also his physical body was similarly affected. A strange force eroded him, causing unbearable pain. His mighty bloodline seemed sealed, falling into eternal slumber.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly as Hu Tianzong carried him back to the human domain. He sighed deeply, having just entered the Epoch-beginner stage only to be reduced to an ordinary human.

In the grand hall, Luo Tian, Yang Jinghua, Hu Tianzong, Xiang Shaochuan, and Shen Gong Feichi sat together, their faces grim.

"This has been a tough journey!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly. As time passed, he had become an ordinary human entirely, leaving him in deep reflection. He had just entered the Epoch-beginner stage only to plummet from heaven to earth.

"The Seven Star Island's ancient texts mention that after Jie Tian, no one else has encountered the Heaven-Man-World Three Declines. Thus, there's no known solution. Fortunately, it's human decline—only a day. Just endure it!" Hu Tianzong sighed softly. Yet, the earth and heaven declines would be fatal for Luo Tian. If they struck during a battle, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"It's no good—still need to find solutions! I feel these two declines will be my two calamities. The ancient clans must have masters who can predict the timing of these declines. If I could know, it would be a passive situation!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, beginning to ponder how to break this terrifying Heaven-Man-World Three Declines.

"Deputy Island Master, perhaps we should return? Spend some time on the Seven Star Island. Maybe it won't happen soon!" Shen Gong Feichi suggested, urging Luo Tian to return.

"Return? You haven't been tested enough!" Luo Tian shook his head, sighing deeply.

Returning to the Seven Star Island and waiting for the Heaven-Man-World Three Declines to fully manifest was indeed a good plan. But Luo Tian still wished to return to the Nine Domains, to reunite with his family. Moreover, the Seven Star Island wasn't safe—other ancient clans were eyeing humans hungrily. They might attack at any moment, leading to bloodshed.

"Kick him out!" Yang Jinghua kicked Shen Gong Feichi again, his frustration echoing the Seven Star Island's concerns. Only this Shen Gong Feichi lived carefree.

"Anyway, the Sea's Edge journey was successful. We found the Zixiao Divine Lotus. Now we just need to win the resource battle!" Xiang Shaochuan spoke with a smile, stepping out of the hall to train Shen Gong Feichi.

"Easy for you to say!" Yang Jinghua's face twisted with a bitter smile, his gaze heavy. He thought of the ten蛮族 prodigies.

"How much time until the final battle?" Luo Tian asked solemnly. Clearly, the Seven Star Island's forces were at a disadvantage. Though many蛮族 had been struck by his lightning, nine prodigies remained. Plus, Tu Feiyang and others stood with the蛮族—there was no way to handle them.

Who could have imagined the蛮族 would send so many? Usually, only one or two Sage Peak-level warriors came to oversee the Sea's Edge battle.

"There's no way around it. Even if we abandon the resource competition, they won't let us go. It was Luo Tian's Epoch Trial that exposed us. Even so, it's a碾压!" Yang Jinghua shook his head.

"Why have the royal clan prodigies all come to the Sea's Edge? I don't think it's just for the Zixiao Divine Lotus!" Luo Tian felt heavy, sensing a major move by the ancient clans. The Sea's Edge was just the beginning.

"Do you mean the ancient clans will attack the Seven Star Island?" Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua, both sharp-minded, guessed Luo Tian's thoughts.

"It's impossible! The Origin Domain isn't just the蛮族 continent—other continents also have humans. They've always kept the clans in check, never broken!" Hu Tianzong spoke softly. If Luo Tian's guess was true, it wasn't just the Sea's Edge forces in danger but the entire Seven Star Island might face annihilation.

"Hope for the best!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, not wanting his guess to come true but forced to consider it.

"Regardless, let's deal with the immediate crisis first. Though our high-level forces are at a disadvantage, we can still make up for it with other methods!" Luo Tian addressed the two, lighting their eyes briefly before they dimmed again.

"I have a formation here. Brother Yang, take it to the disciples. It might yield unexpected results!" Luo Tian addressed Yang Jinghua, transmitting the Tongtian Array of Tongtian Mountain.

Luo Tian was intimately familiar with the Tongtian Array, having once broken it through brute force. Yet he knew its terrifying power and that it had been modified by Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong. If many superiors and Sage Peak-level warriors wielded it, he couldn't fathom its power.

Yang Jinghua stepped out of the hall, time pressing—teaching ten thousand disciples would take a while. The hall was now only Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong.

"What's next?" Hu Tianzong smiled, their relationship having eased after the previous events.

"Let's go for a walk. After today, I'll find something. Not sure if this place has it!" Luo Tian smiled faintly, standing up and stepping out of the hall.

Hu Tianzong worried about Luo Tian's safety, knowing any ordinary cultivator could crush him—truly crush.

"Shiver..." As Luo Tian stepped out of the hall, he felt a wave of coldness enveloping his body. He shivered involuntarily.

"This is truly uncomfortable!" Luo Tian chuckled, adjusting to the cold before walking through the camp.

Hu Tianzong walked beside him, his hand emitting a chill to prevent it from entering Luo Tian's body.

Each of the Seven Star Island's elite disciples looked at Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong with respect. They had witnessed Luo Tian's terrifying power—using Heavenly Punishment to instantly annihilate tens of thousands of蛮族, forcing the first prodigy of the蛮神殿, Man Hun, to surrender and reveal the secret technique of the蛮神殿.

"Ah..." As Luo Tian walked, a piercing scream caught his attention. Following the sound of a pig's wail, he found the source.

Twenty or so burly men surrounded a rotund fat man, attacking him relentlessly. Though the fat man was agile, he couldn't match twenty opponents of his level. Punches landed squarely, causing the fat man to scream in agony.

Luo Tian smiled at the pitiful Shen Gong Feichi, then turned away. He knew this wouldn't truly train Shen Gong Feichi; only true battlefield experience could make him understand war's brutality.

"This kid's talent isn't weak, but he lacks ambition!" Hu Tianzong also saw Shen Gong Feichi being beaten and shook his head.

"My friend doesn't need to fight in blood!" Luo Tian's eyes hardened, speaking softly. He hoped those around him would live as they wished, not forced onto another path.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Hu Tianzong's body trembled slightly before nodding respectfully.

"Return to rest. Stay here tomorrow. I'll come back ten days later for the final battle!" Luo Tian sighed, knowing he needed to fulfill his promises with strong power.

"Proving oneself—Epoch Master!" Luo Tian's resolve to become an Epoch Master grew stronger with each experience.

That night, Luo Tian comfortably lay in bed, sleeping like an ordinary person. Hu Tianzong sat outside his room, guarding him.

The next morning, crimson sunlight filtered through the cracks, illuminating Luo Tian's face. He slowly opened his eyes.

"Ah..." Luo Tian stretched, a look of enjoyment in his eyes. He hadn't rested properly; this sleep was desperately needed.

"Amazing!" Soon after, he felt his abnormal strength. His dantian's white Epoch energy radiated intense fluctuations, instantly improving his mood.

Chapter 1272: Lord of the Blood Sea

At the Sea's Edge, Luo Tian walked through every corner, seeking something that could sense the Nine Domains. His vast spiritual awareness swept across mountains but found only broken fragments of sacred weapons, no other results.

"This Sea's Edge—what is it? It seems ancient. If it truly was an ancient battlefield, how could there be no relics at all?" Luo Tian spent five days exploring the Sea's Edge, finally covering every inch.

"Finding the Zixiao Divine Lotus—a life-giving herb—there must be other treasures. Not even a pseudo-Epoch treasure, let alone fragments!" Luo Tian sighed.

"The Sea's Edge is nearly fully explored!" Luo Tian stood on the blood-red ocean, his gaze deep.

A sense of unease made him hesitate, considering whether to fly deeper.

"Take a gamble! If this truly was an ancient battlefield, there must be something extraordinary in the blood sea!" Luo Tian's gaze deepened as he flew across the blood-red ocean, gradually moving away from the Sea's Edge land.

"Tu Feiyang!" His vast spiritual awareness swept, detecting a familiar presence miles away. Luo Tian's mind paused.

He hadn't expected to meet Tu Feiyang in the blood sea. Tu Feiyang's entire body radiated blood qi, as if harmonizing with the blood sea. If not for Luo Tian's powerful spiritual awareness, he might have missed him.

"He came alone—there must be something secret!" Luo Tian immediately deduced Tu Feiyang had a major plan, possibly related to the blood sea. And it couldn't be known by Man Hun, Fu Xingyue, and Fan Jingyu.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian waved his hand, golden Epoch Scripture fragments appearing in his palm. The light was suppressed; if observed closely, a ghostly face marked the Scripture.

Previously, Luo Tian had used Zixiao Thunder to remove the rust from the Epoch Scripture but left this ghostly face.

Luo Tian didn't know what the ghostly face was, but he knew it wasn't ordinary. If it were earlier, his识海's Epoch Scripture would have merged with it. Yet now, despite the rust being removed, it hadn't merged. This made Luo Tian suspect that the voice from the black mist earlier hadn't been fully extinguished—perhaps it had even changed.

The ghostly face looked vivid, and if Luo Tian stared too long, he felt dizzy, making him wary.

Though wary, he still activated it, sending golden light to shield himself and conceal his aura.

Tu Feiyang's blood-red hair fluttered as he flew over the blood sea, unaware of Luo Tian following him. His face bore a habitual smile, revealing cold fangs that glowed with menace.

"The elders of our clan said this Sea's Edge blood sea is the burial ground of our bloodline's ruler. I don't know if it's true, but if it is, there might be a ruler's inheritance. If I obtain it, who could oppose me!" Tu Feiyang thought coldly, imagining himself invincible among his peers after obtaining the blood lord's inheritance.

"Damn Luo Tian! If I succeed, I'll capture him first and force him to reveal the secret of entering the Nine Domains!" Tu Feiyang's mind fantasized, his blood-red eyes constantly scanning the distance.

Luo Tian didn't know what Tu Feiyang was thinking, but he maintained a mile's distance behind him. His mind decided: "No matter what Tu Feiyang's secret is, I must prevent him from succeeding."

Two people flew over the blood sea—one ahead, one behind. After an hour, Tu Feiyang finally stopped, his face showing excitement as he gazed at the blood sea below.

A blood-red vortex appeared on the otherwise calm ocean, like a deep abyss ready to swallow anyone.

"I've found it!" Tu Feiyang exclaimed, without hesitation, his body plunging into the vortex.

A moment later, Luo Tian appeared at the spot where Tu Feiyang had been, gazing at the blood sea. He too surged into it with golden light.

As soon as he entered the blood water, Luo Tian felt the coldness intensify. He was certain this icy bloodwater would freeze even a Sage Peak beginner.

But soon, Luo Tian's face showed shock as his spiritual awareness revealed a blood-red palace. The palace was immense, and he saw countless souls circling it, terrifyingly sinister. A massive vortex formed a path leading to the blood-red palace.

Tu Feiyang's eyes gleamed with excitement, standing before the grand gate of the palace. His gaze was equally awed.

"I never expected it to be real! This trip wasn't in vain!" Tu Feiyang gazed at the soul-like figures outside the palace gate, his eyes showing a smile.

His blood-red hand emitted red light, pushing toward the massive gate. As soon as he approached, the gate suddenly revealed a grotesque ghost with horns, its cold fangs biting toward Tu Feiyang's hand.

"Does it require bloodline's blood to open?" Tu Feiyang didn't withdraw his hand but let the ghost bite it.

Luo Tian stood nearby, surprised as he watched the ancient palace. His eyes showed deep caution—he felt he had encountered something formidable, and this palace was definitely no good place.

Blood flowed from Tu Feiyang's hand into the ghost's mouth until his face turned pale. The grotesque ghost finally released its grip, returning to the gate.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed as the massive gate roared and slowly opened.

"It's open!" Tu Feiyang's eyes gleamed with excitement, gazing at the blood-red palace and stepping inside.

Luo Tian hesitated. He could sense this grand hall's complexity. If he continued, he might face great trouble. But if he returned now and let Tu Feiyang succeed, it would be a major threat to him.

"Brace yourself!" After thinking, Luo Tian made his decision and rushed into the ancient blood-red gate as it slowly closed.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian entered the gate, he felt an irresistible force acting on his body, forcing him to crash onto the ground and stop flying.

"Another no-fly zone!" Luo Tian's mind stirred, surprised this Sea's Edge had encountered two no-fly zones.

"Could the Zixiao Divine Lotus be related to this ancient palace?" Luo Tian's mind puzzled, trembling.

"Perhaps it's connected to the Zixiao Divine Lotus. Could this palace be related to an Epoch Master or a royal ruler?" Luo Tian's mind trembled as he gazed around.

He saw no sign of Tu Feiyang but noticed scattered sacred weapons and bones. The bones took various forms, not just human but other ancient races. They covered his vision entirely.

"Could the Sea's Edge truly be an ancient battlefield? All these corpses and sacred weapons were absorbed into this palace?" Luo Tian sighed, his eyes showing excitement. His vast spiritual awareness swept over the broken sacred weapons, hoping to find something connecting to the Nine Domains.

But he didn't expect much—these sacred weapons were broken, worn by endless years, their divine essence nearly vanished.

"Indeed!" Luo Tian sighed deeply after an hour of searching, though he had prepared for it. Still, he felt disappointed.

"If there's nothing here, I'll find Tu Feiyang and stop him. If I can kill him, it would be better!" Luo Tian's eyes showed coldness as he walked along the path of bones and sacred weapons.

After walking half an hour, he passed through the bone road and entered a grand hall. The hall remained sinister; several fresh red ancient coffins lay there, but each one gave Luo Tian a sense of fear.

"Who is buried here? Though there's no aura, it still makes me feel fearful!" Luo Tian sighed softly, knowing these coffins held titans.

"I wish I could open these coffins to see!" Luo Tian's mind was curious as he walked along the narrow path between rows of coffins.

"Crack..." As Luo Tian stepped onto the path, a loud sound echoed from the nearby coffin. He immediately stopped, his nerves tensing.

"What is it?" Luo Tian halted and activated the Epoch Scripture to protect himself, then retreated quickly.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian stepped back, the coffin's lid suddenly crashed open, releasing a stench of decay into the hall.

A withered body slowly rose from the coffin, its blood seemingly drained, devoid of life. Luo Tian's brows furrowed.

"A mummy?" Luo Tian gazed at the withered body, his mind tense as he entered battle mode.

A human-shaped mummy stood up slowly, its body covered in white hair. Only its eyes were blood-red, glowing outside with fangs protruding and emitting a stench of corpses. Its red eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 1273: Blood Lord's Inheritance

Luo Tian's face darkened as he stared at the white-haired mummy, his eyes filled with intense caution. The mummy's aura radiated a strong sense of danger, wisps of white mist emanating from it, as if freezing the entire hall.

"Epoch Mid-Stage!" Luo Tian's mind tensed, sensing the mummy's cultivation. It must have been a titanic power in life.

"Who has such power to turn an Epoch Mid-Stage powerhouse into a mummy?" Luo Tian's mind trembled. Besides the Epoch Masters, he couldn't imagine who could have such a terrifying ability.

"Could this truly be the palace of an Epoch Master?" Luo Tian muttered, then felt a cold presence behind him.

"Damn!" Luo Tian jumped up and turned to face the blood-red light, readying himself for battle.

But what surprised Luo Tian was that the terrifying white-haired mummy didn't attack him, only staring at him with its eyes.

"Huh?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, watching the mummy without Epoch energy but with an incredibly strong body. He pondered what was causing this.

"Is it something on me that makes it wary?" Luo Tian thought, scanning his body for anything.

"Epoch Scripture!" He suddenly realized the floating Epoch Scripture on his front. He had never put it away since the beginning.

"The ghostly face changed!" Upon careful observation, Luo Tian noticed the ghostly face on the Scripture had turned into a weeping expression.

"Indeed, there's something strange!" Luo Tian's mind trembled. This ghostly face felt sinister but hadn't shown any other strange behavior yet—perhaps it was helping him, scaring off this white-haired mummy.

Though Luo Tian wasn't afraid of the mummy, it was better not to fight in this strange hall.

"Go!" After thinking for a while, Luo Tian took another step along the narrow path, his mind still tense.

To Luo Tian's surprise, the white-haired mummy followed him like a machine, making his lips twitch. He felt uncomfortable having this mummy accompany him constantly, especially with its icy aura.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." As Luo Tian walked on the coffin-made path, each step produced a thunderous sound. His mind tensed.

"Roar..." The white-haired mummy let out a low growl, and the blood-red coffins gradually fell silent.

They had safely passed through the coffin path, and Luo Tian sighed in relief, surprised it was so smooth.

"Big brother, go back. You've brought me this far!" Luo Tian turned to the white-haired mummy and spoke, hoping it understood.

But the mummy remained silent, leaving Luo Tian speechless with a bitter smile. He had no choice but to continue forward.

Meanwhile, Tu Feiyang's face also showed a smile. His arm glowed red, and a pattern emerged on it. If Luo Tian were here, he would be shocked—Tu Feiyang's pattern was identical to the ghostly face on the Epoch Scripture fragment, though the latter looked more vivid.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian took a step forward, the surrounding world changed again, as if entering another space.

The entire space was blood-red. In the center stood a blood-red altar, its aura thick with blood qi. As Luo Tian stepped into this space, the blood qi surged violently, enveloping the altar.

At that moment, Luo Tian saw a figure seated on the altar. Though only a back view, he could clearly sense an immense pressure from it.

"Someone!" Luo Tian's heart trembled, but he could only see a back view. Yet he felt the presence was that of the palace's master—perhaps an Epoch Master!

"Who is it? Not the Blood Lord?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, a bad premonition stirring.
