The cawing of a raven echoed, its voice hoarse and guttural. A golden crow, spanning a hundred zhang in size, bathed in the radiant flames of divine fire, soared into the sky, rushing toward Zhu Geqingtian.

"What use is it to reveal your true form?" Zhu Geqingtian sneered, his expression laced with contempt. His body flickered as a gray long sword materialized in his grasp, slicing toward the three-legged golden crow.

The battlefield once again returned to a fleeting balance, leaving all present with expressions of awe at the formidable power on display.

Luo Tian observed the various battlefields, noting that Long Jie maintained a relentless grip on Hun Tiance. Among all the skirmishes, Nan Gong Yuqing's position was the most tranquil, for his opponent was Fu Xingyue, a long-time friend of Luo Tian. Though their attacks roared with immense might, neither had unleashed their full strength due to Luo Tian's presence.

On another front, Yan Hongtao faced a grim fate. His opponent was Ban Zhi, a prodigy of the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan). The Barbarians revered physical prowess, their defenses bordering on the absurd. Yan Hongtao's evasive maneuvers were cunning, yet his strikes inflicted minimal damage upon Ban Zhi.

Yet Ban Zhi's every step seemed to pinpoint Yan Hongtao with uncanny precision, leaving him in constant disarray.

Meanwhile, Guan Xingjian and Tu Feiyang clashed evenly. Guan's talent and strength left even Luo Tian in awe, while Tu's fortune was astonishing—his strategies never ceased to challenge Guan.

As time passed, the battlefields finally shifted. A golden dragon erupted skyward, its body aglow with radiant gold, exuding an overwhelming aura of dragons that swept through the cosmos. The golden dragon's power severed the starscape, striking Hun Tiance directly.

"Boom..." Hun Tiance could not withstand the golden dragon's tail, disintegrating into a mist of blood. Gray blood stained the golden tail.

"Dragon Emperor, might!" The human faction erupted in cheers again as Long Jie, the Dragon Domain's master, once more vanquished a primordial clan prodigy.

"A嗡..." Long Jie's face paled as he coalesced into human form, blood trickling from his mouth. The clash with Hun Tiance had left him grievously wounded; the opponent was no mere underling but a true primordial clan prodigy.

"You dare challenge my brother!" Long Jie's voice was cold, his body exhaling imperial dragon qi. A golden dragon swiftly enveloped Hun Tiance's flesh and soul, beginning to refine them.

"Another primordial clan prodigy is about to perish!" All present trembled, watching Hun Tiance's flesh and soul wither within the golden dragon.

"Ah..." A light laugh echoed, followed by an earth-shaking aura. A gray dragon surged upward from the cosmos, colliding with Long Jie's imperial dragon qi and scattering it. It enveloped Hun Tiance, who was on the brink of death.

A youth emerged from afar, his presence radiating an aura familiar to Luo Tian.

"Another primordial clan prince!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed, his heart tightening.

Not only Luo Tian, but others also felt tension as they gazed at the youth whose eyes were gray, swirling like a vortex that seemed to pull one into a quagmire.

"Let me be your steed, and you shall live! Only a dragon with such rich bloodline could match my status!" The youth smiled, addressing Long Jie.

"Die!" Long Jie's face turned pale but his aura surged defiantly.

"Die!" Luo Tian's expression darkened, his gaze filled with killing intent as he stared at the youth who had dared to call Long Jie a steed.

Long Jie was his blood brother; to suggest he be a steed was an unforgivable transgression.

"Be my steed, and in the ancient times, countless dragons would have begged for this chance. I grant you three breaths to consider!" Hun Batian smiled, his gaze filled with satisfaction as he regarded Long Jie.

"Roar!" A dragon's cry echoed, and Long Jie's hands moved, sending forth a golden dragon seal imbued with imperial dragon qi. It descended upon Hun Batian, proving his stance through action.

"Then I shall subdue you!" Hun Batian chuckled, gazing at Long Jie as if he were a beast.

Chapter 1462: Battle Against the Primordial Clan Prince

The golden dragon seal, surrounded by imperial dragon qi and radiating immense power, descended upon Hun Batian.

Yet Hun Batian merely chuckled, extending a finger that transformed into a mountain of gray, colliding with the dragon seal.

A thunderous explosion echoed through the cosmos, its shockwaves sweeping outward and buffeting both Long Jie and Hun Batian.

"Long Jie, return!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, watching Long Jie teetering under the violent shockwaves. If he continued fighting, Long Jie might suffer injury; after all, his opponent was a primordial clan prince, not comparable to Hun Tiance. Even Luo Tian himself would tread carefully against such an opponent. He did not wish for Long Jie to take the risk.

"Brother, I can still fight!" Long Jie stood firm, gazing at Luo Tian. Their bond had endured years, and he instantly understood Luo Tian's thoughts. He knew that if Luo Tian intervened, it might bring unforeseen consequences; he also did not wish for Luo Tian to take the risk.

"I'll handle it!" Zhou Weihuo and Lu Tianyu, who had no opponents, flashed battle intent toward Hun Batian.

"Despicable humans! You may fight together!" Hun Batian spoke lightly, dismissing Luo Tian and others entirely. His voice carried boundless arrogance.

"Roar!" The primordial clan warriors all roared, their eyes burning with fervor. To them, any primordial clan prince was an invincible force, unbeatable. As proof, only Yu Fanti had managed to keep Sun Miechen on the defensive.

"You are not his match; let me handle it—should be no problem!" Luo Tian smiled, pressing the two back before rising into the sky beside Long Jie.

"Brother, return! Leave him to me!" Long Jie's face bore anxiety as he addressed Luo Tian.

"You've grown up, so you no longer heed your brother's words?" Luo Tian patted Long Jie's shoulder, his gaze mirroring how he had once looked at the young Long Jie.

"Still doubt my strength? All primordial clan princes shall be crushed!" Luo Tian's voice carried unwavering confidence.

"Ah!" Long Jie gazed at Luo Tian, then nodded gently. He trusted Luo Tian would subdue Hun Batian.

"Hah! Arrogant! One cursed by fate dares to subdue our prince? How absurd!" The primordial clan warriors laughed loudly upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

"Indeed, humans are formidable!" Hun Batian's smile faded slightly as Luo Tian stepped forward.

Due to his recent awakening, Hun Batian did not yet know who Luo Tian was. Yet, through an instinctual pull, he sensed the youth's bloodline power rivaled his own.

"Enough talk—fight!" Luo Tian's aura rose gradually, having adapted to the curse over time. However, he had to divert part of his focus to counter the curse, so his state was not at its peak.

"Lu Tian!" The human faction erupted in murmurs, watching Luo Tian reappear in the cosmos. They had not known what curse he bore, but after someone revealed his situation, they understood how extraordinary he was.

"Invincible!" The human faction roared lowly, their voices rising in intensity. Luo Tian was the embodiment of humanity; if he fell, it would be a heavy blow to their people. Though the primordial clan warriors were arrogant, they knew that as long as Luo Tian did not step forward, humanity had no defeat.

"Your reputation is quite high. I suppose subduing you would greatly impact humanity!" Hun Batian gazed at the fervent humans before dashing toward Luo Tian.

"Kill!" Luo Tian roared, his body radiating white light without fear as he rushed toward Hun Batian.

"Boom!" No pretense—two fists collided instantly, and both men recoiled, their eyes filled with solemnity as they locked gazes.

"Rare indeed! This era has produced one who can match us!" Hun Batian's expression bore admiration, his blood calmed.

"Too much talking!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed cold as he lunged toward Hun Batian again.

Hun Batian had no fear of Luo Tian, his body radiating gray qi that coalesced into runes on his arms.

"Bo Tian Art!" Seeing the runes, a peak elder of the Hun Tian clan in the void bore a flicker of excitement.

"The Bo Tian Art of the Hun Tian Emperor? Indeed, the prince of a king must master all his father's techniques!" Other clan elders also bore admiration.

"Boom! Boom!" Luo Tian's aura was earth-shaking; with two supreme arts, each punch he threw was terrifying.

Hun Batian's bloodline was immeasurably rich, and he too wielded a king's supreme technique. The two clashed in the cosmos, engaging in near hand-to-hand combat with thunderous explosions.

As they fought, Luo Tian was awestruck—since his emergence, he had never faced an opponent. Yet now, Hun Batian could match him in combat.

Luo Tian's awe was mirrored by Hun Batian's inner turmoil. In the ancient times, clan bloodlines were immensely powerful; humanity was weak, their flesh and bones incomparable.

Yet now, Luo Tian could match him in flesh-and-blood combat without fear, even leaving Hun Batian with wounds. This shattered his perception of humanity.

The two clashed relentlessly, igniting the blood of both sides. They forgot to watch other prodigies' battles as their fight ignited the hearts of all present.

The void cracked, and with each clash, both men's bodies glowed with light. Yet as time passed, their flesh bore massive wounds, fighting like bloodthirsty beasts—each punch exchanged with equal ferocity.

Blood rained from their bodies, making the onlookers tense, their breaths quickening.

"Who could have imagined one could fight a primordial clan prince to such an extent!" The Ten Thousand Ancient Clans trembled, watching Luo Tian drenched in blood.

Meanwhile, Sun Miechen was utterly defeated by Yu Fanti, who had him on the defensive.

Time passed slowly; both Luo Tian and Hun Batian spat blood, their bodies riddled with cracks as if they could shatter at any moment.

"Boom!" After another clash, both men separated, panting heavily in the cosmos.

"I did not expect to meet such a prodigy upon awakening—this is most exhilarating!" Hun Batian laughed, his gray qi rising before re-entering his body.

"Primordial clan princes are nothing!" Luo Tian coughed blood, his body radiating holy white light. The six immortal bodies in his dantian gradually calmed.

"A嗡..." Gray divine patterns flickered, and Hun Batian's wounds rapidly healed, restoring him to perfection. The onlookers inhaled sharply.

Luo Tian was no less swift; his body radiated infinite vitality, and the grievous wounds on him swiftly healed.

"The warm-up is over! Now comes the real battle!" Hun Batian smiled, his hands moving as a surge of gray qi filled the cosmos.

"Perfect!" Luo Tian's face remained pale, his eyes alight with battle intent. His white reincarnation immortal body shifted into a skeletal image of the Mahākāla, its dark qi surging from his body.

"My heavens! They were just warming up!" The onlookers gasped, their eyes wide with disbelief as both men's auras returned to formidable strength.

"Roar!" A low growl echoed through the cosmos as gray qi rose from Hun Batian's hands, forming a grotesque ghostly figure with a terrifying aura. It roared as it solidified.

"A嗡..." A black magic sword materialized in Luo Tian's grasp, emitting a continuous hum.

"Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Heaven!" Hun Batian roared, his hands moving rapidly. A chorus of roars erupted from his grasp as ten thousand gray ghosts coalesced, filling the cosmos.

"One... a hundred... ten thousand..." Ten thousand gray ghosts formed solidly, roaring as they filled the cosmos. The gray starscape vanished from view, as if truly devoured.

"Go!" Hun Batian pointed his finger at Luo Tian.

"Roar!" Ten thousand ghosts roared, surging like a gray tide toward Luo Tian, intent on tearing him apart.

"A嗡..." The black magic sword swung, its dark aura radiating immense power as Luo Tian slashed repeatedly.

Chapter 1463: Shock of the Ten Thousand Clans

The black magic sword swung repeatedly, its dark aura slicing through waves of gray ghosts. Each strike shattered countless ghosts into swirling ash that vanished into the void.

"Boom!" After seven slashes, the black magic sword shattered in Luo Tian's grasp. His hands moved swiftly as the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map erupted, descending upon the gray ghosts.

"Roar!" Each ghost was annihilated by the two martial arts, vanishing within seconds. The Divine King's Nine Heavens Map crashed down, annihilating countless ghosts before continuing toward Hun Batian.

Hun Batian bore a flicker of admiration as he extended his hand, an invisible wave enveloping the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map.

"Boom!" The massive divine map exploded under Hun Batian's palm, scattering into a storm of chaos.

"Again!" Hun Batian extended his hand again, a gray finger erupting with power like a mountain. Yet it possessed an astonishing penetrating force, as if capable of piercing the heavens, crushing Luo Tian.

"Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Heaven!" The void's peak elders gasped, watching the gray finger. Since Hun Batian's attack began, he had used techniques of the Hun Tian Emperor. Each technique could subdue any late-era peak strength.

"You wield royal techniques, but I possess the inheritance of an Epoch Master!" Luo Tian's hands moved, a golden vortex swirling in the cosmos. It radiated immense suction, its center forming an endless black hole capable of devouring all things.

A golden seal emerged in the cosmos, radiating immense power like a divine artifact born from the heavens. It pressed down upon Hun Batian's gray finger with overwhelming pressure.

"Boom!" A thunderous explosion echoed through the cosmos, annihilating vast areas of space and filling it with gray mist. Luo Tian and Hun Batian's figures were obscured by the gray mist, vanishing from view.

"The Hun Tian Emperor's Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Heaven has failed against the Epoch Master's martial arts!" The Ten Thousand Ancient Clans bore expressions of disbelief. Though the gray mist obscured their vision, the golden seal remained visible within it, flickering intermittently.

"Boom!" A muffled sound echoed from the mist, and simultaneously, the golden seal vanished. Luo Tian and Hun Batian reappeared in view.

"Primordial clan princes are nothing!" Luo Tian sneered, gazing at Hun Batian, who stood a万里 away with blood trickling from his lips. His body radiated an overwhelming aura.

"Die!" Hun Batian's face darkened, his gaze at Luo Tian's sneer. This was the second time Luo Tian had spoken thusly, and it unsettled him.

"Vast God's Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!" Luo Tian would not grant Hun Batian a chance to retaliate. With one step, his black foot shattered the cosmos, landing upon Hun Batian's head, causing his expression to finally shift.

"Eight Directions, I Alone Reign!" Hun Batian's face twisted with ferocity as he moved his hands. Gray qi surged from his back, coalescing into a gray figure resembling a mountain, awe-inspiring.

"A嗡..." The hum of the void intensified as a gray long sword appeared in the figure's hand. The gray figure raised its sword, which ascended to strike the heavens with immense power, descending upon Luo Tian.

"Sky Sword! This is the supreme technique of the Hun Tian Emperor. When he was a near-epoch master, one strike annihilated three near-epoch masters, securing his position as an ultimate emperor!" The clans gazed with fervor at the awe-inspiring gray figure, their eyes filled with reverence as if looking upon the Hun Tian Emperor himself.

"Yet this human employed a technique of the ancient clan, the蛮 Seven Steps!" The clans' eyes flickered with amazement as they beheld the barbaric aura of the massive foot.

"Boom!" The thunderous sound echoed again, shaking the cosmos as the two clashed. Luo Tian's body was hurled backward, blood trickling from his lips.

Meanwhile, Hun Batian fared no better; the figure behind him was shattered by the black foot's impact, leaving his body riddled with cracks. His gaze bore shock.

"Again!" Luo Tian's body hovered for a moment before rising from the cosmos. A phantom figure emerged behind him, radiating immense power. His eyes bore cold intent as he stomped toward Hun Batian.

The蛮 Seven Steps was now flawlessly executed, and within moments, the second and third steps were taken.

"A嗡..." The gray figure reappeared behind Hun Batian, its long sword descending again.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!" The thunderous sound was overwhelming, leaving all present in awe. Even the thirteen peak elders of the epoch watched with shock as two kings clashed.

"These attacks could injure us! If we wish to subdue this Luo Tian, we must strike together!" The thirteen peak elders murmured, watching the two kings clash in the cosmos.

"The bet was not wrong!" Fu Wenbin smiled, gazing at Luo Tian clashing with Hun Batian. His eyes bore satisfaction.

"As long as we do not kill the primordial clan prince, whatever damage you cause, I will cover it!" Fu Wenbin thought to himself.

Luo Tian's current strength had made Fu Wenbin value him more. Initially, he had merely protected Luo Tian once in the Star Moon Clan, but now, seeing him clash with Hun Batian, Fu Wenbin was more determined to protect Luo Tian.

Fu Wenbin knew this era might produce another epoch master or an ancient clan emperor. However, since the human race's epoch masters emerged, the ancient clans had not produced an emperor in a long time. Thus, this era might still see a human as the path to enlightenment. At present, Luo Tian was the most likely candidate!

Though the epoch master's disciples were powerful, they did not belong to this era. From past enlightenment masters, none had emerged from another era. Thus, Luo Tian was the most likely candidate for this era's supreme being—provided he did not perish. The Star Moon Clan had a deep connection with Luo Tian, so even if they were an ancient clan, they would still be protected by him.

"This Luo Tian cannot be left alive!" Yet Fu Wenbin was not the only one to realize this. The thirteen peak elders also did, their eyes filled with murderous intent as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Don't do anything foolish!" Fu Wenbin sighed deeply, watching Luo Tian clash with Hun Batian. If Luo Tian truly killed Hun Batian, it would anger the ten thousand clans, even the Star Moon Clan could not protect him.

"Vast God's Six Steps Shaking Heaven and Earth!" Luo Tian roared, and in the midst of people's awe, he took his sixth step. His black foot radiated immense power, descending upon Hun Batian.

"One Strike to Sever the Eight Directions!" The gray sword's aura rose again, slicing through space and time with ancient power.

Two massive figures, as if reborn kings, clashed under the astonished gazes of all present.

"The Epoch Sword is also a weapon!" Luo Tian gazed at the devastating sword aura, which was more than double his seven demon swords. He knew if they clashed directly, neither would win—only mutual injury would result.

"Eight Directions' Treasure Sealing Art!" Luo Tian roared, his hand extending as an invisible wave surged from him, rushing toward the gray sword.

"What's happening?" The moment the invisible wave touched the gray sword, Hun Batian's face changed instantly. His eyes bore disbelief.

Hun Batian could clearly feel the gray sword had slipped from his control, its strike momentarily stalling. Though only for an instant, it was enough to change much.

"It worked!" Luo Tian's pale face bore joy, sweat streaming down his face. The brief control of the sword had cost him greatly.

"But it's all worth it!" Luo Tian laughed inwardly, for his black foot had already struck, crushing Hun Batian's body.

"Boom!" The gray figure was obliterated under the black foot, its power unstoppable as it crushed Hun Batian's body.

"Boom!" Blood dyed the cosmos, and Hun Batian's body was reduced to a mist of blood, drifting through space. All present bore expressions of horror.

"How could this happen?" Everyone rubbed their eyes in disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian standing in the cosmos.

They had felt Hun Batian's overwhelming attack, which could have withstood Luo Tian's sixth step. Yet at the critical moment, it had suddenly failed, leaving them in shock.

"Primordial clan princes are nothing!" Luo Tian laughed, then rushed toward the blood mist, his eyes filled with fierce killing intent.

Chapter 1464: Sun Miechen's Crisis

In the vast cosmos, stars continuously shattered. All present bore expressions of awe as they gazed at Luo Tian, their faces filled with terror.

The Ten Thousand Ancient Clans fell silent, gazing at the gray divine blood slowly coalescing in space.

Primordial clan princes were invincible beings of the ancient times, their status revered among all clans. The Ten Thousand Ancient Clans could not believe a primordial clan prince had fallen.

Not only the clans, but even the thirteen peak elders in the void bore expressions of disbelief. This was the first time a primordial clan prince had lost, exceeding their expectations.

Yet soon, their faces darkened as they saw Luo Tian, eyes filled with killing intent, rushing toward the still-unfused Hun Batian.

"Die!" The thirteen peak elders were enraged, their bodies flickering as they all rushed from the void toward Luo Tian.

As the thirteen surged forward, the cosmos filled with immense pressure. The entire space stilled, and even the other battling prodigies paused, their gazes filled with fear as they watched the thirteen powerful figures.

"Luo Tian, don't be foolish! The primordial clan prince's status in the Ten Thousand Ancient Clans is far greater than you imagine. If you truly kill him, I cannot protect you!" Fu Wenbin's eyes bore urgency as he transmitted his thoughts to Luo Tian.

No need for Fu Wenbin's transmission; Luo Tian's body halted under the immense pressure of the thirteen epoch peak masters. Ten plus epoch peak masters, without even a near-epoch master's cultivation, could subdue all—Luo Tian included.

"He dares to kill the Hun Tian Emperor's prince!" The Ten Thousand Ancient Clans bore expressions of fury, realizing the truth and roaring at Luo Tian, their eyes wild.

"Damn it, is a primordial clan prince really worth this much excitement?" Luo Tian stood in the cosmos, gazing at the thirteen powerful figures and the young prodigies of the ancient clans with bloodshot eyes.

"Kid, you're seeking death!" A peak elder of the Hun Tian clan extended his hand, a gray palm descending toward Luo Tian.

"We are not easy to provoke!" Xuan Bing Laozu moved, his icy palm striking against the Hun Tian clan's elder.

"A嗡..." The void trembled as figures of humanity emerged from the void, their ultimate power spreading across the cosmos. Artifacts of the epoch were suspended above them—figures like Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian, veteran masters.

Luo Tian could not die; currently, only he could match the primordial clan princes. Though their sanctuaries had epoch masters' descendants, none were yet awakened except Zhu Geqingtian!

They did not know how many primordial clan princes had already awakened. If Luo Tian died, humanity's young generation would be severely suppressed.

The two factions immediately faced off, tension spreading through the cosmos as they glared at each other.

"Cough cough!" Hun Batian, with a moment's respite, finally coalesced. His gaze bore disbelief as he stared at Luo Tian standing there. He could not accept that his Hun Tian clan prince, a being revered by all clans, had been defeated by humanity. This result left him in disbelief.

The two factions tensed, their gazes locked as waves of power clashed. The near-kill of Hun Batian had become a fuse, igniting the two factions completely.

"Roar!" A host of Ten Thousand Ancient Clans emerged from the Thunder Domain, their faces filled with grim determination. They stood behind the thirteen peak elders, their power earth-shaking.

"Did you think we humans had no preparations?" Diao Yuanshan and others bore cold expressions, speaking coldly. Artifacts of the epoch radiated powerful waves as figures emerged behind them.

"Kill!" Killing intent spread, and elites from various domains appeared, their gazes filled with battle spirit.

Yang Jinghua, Hu Tianzong, and Shen Gongfei stood at the forefront of the crowd. With the conflict escalating, they all appeared.

The Seven Star Island's people from the Seven Star Seas stood behind them, their bodies radiating iron-blooded intent. Then came other domain elites.

Yang Jinghua's face remained cold, his long sword in hand, gazing at the ancient clan people with battle spirit.

The Seven Star Island was a formidable force, having once fought against the barbarians in the Origin Domain. Their power was no less than that of the ancient clans, even surpassing them in ferocity.

Yang Jinghua had never feared war; he was born for it. Since uniting with the Four Sacred Star Domains, he had managed their integration swiftly. Besides Xuan Bing Laozu, the Four Sacred Star Domains accepted him first.

Though Yang Jinghua's cultivation was not as high as Luo Tian, his prestige was the highest among the Seven Star Island members in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Even Guan Xingjian was inferior to him—born as a commander.

"Humanity, are you truly daring to start a war?" The thirteen epoch peak elders gazed at the dense human forces behind them, their eyes filled with a flicker of concern. They knew if war truly broke out, it would be bloodshed.

"You wish to fight? We will surely resist!" Diao Yuanshan and others responded strongly. At this point, everything else was forgotten.

"Hun Tian Emperor's prince is not dead! I suggest we wait a while!"
"Indeed, let's wait. They have epoch artifacts; our chances are slim. Wait for the clan to send imperial troops, and then fight!" The thirteen peak elders whispered among themselves.

"Continue," the thirteen peak elders spoke aloud, standing in the cosmos and retracting their power.

The ancient clans did not wish to start a war, nor did the human faction. If it were not for their desire to kill Luo Tian, they would not have been so强势.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, though he was disappointed for not killing Hun Batian, he was content that war had not erupted prematurely.

War's horror was no stranger to Luo Tian; if it truly broke out, his loved ones and friends might perish in the conflict.

"Continue!" The prodigies who had been fighting heard the agreement between both sides and resumed their attacks.

Thunderous sounds echoed again, but this time Luo Tian was at ease, having no opponent after Hun Batian's defeat.

Luo Tian then gazed at the dense human forces, his face bearing admiration. Humanity's strength was unparalleled as a single race.

Among the Ten Thousand Clans, humanity had reached this point—undoubtedly, it was a terrifying race.

"Perhaps the Ten Thousand Clans wish to destroy humanity for this reason. If given time, humanity would become a subordinate of the ancient clans, ruled by humans!" Luo Tian mused, then gazed at the prodigies' battlefield.

"Immortal Body of Eternity, is this all you can do?" A light laugh echoed through the cosmos, drawing Luo Tian and others' attention to Sun Miechen and Yu Fanti's battle.

Due to Luo Tian nearly killing the primordial clan prince, all had focused on their fight and ignored others.

Now, as they gazed at Sun Miechen and Yu Fanti's battle, they inhaled sharply, their eyes filled with awe.

"This contrast is too great!" They murmured. Sun Miechen's body bore golden cracks, his face grim.

Meanwhile, Yu Fanti, though also bearing wounds, radiated an imposing aura. At this moment, Yu Fanti's back had spread golden wings, with golden feathers drifting through the cosmos.

The entire cosmos appeared resplendent, but beneath its beauty lay an immense killing intent—unparalleled.

"Die!" Yu Fanti's face bore coldness as he moved his hands, summoning golden feathers that formed a divine sword. It descended upon Sun Miechen with ferocity.

"Pu! Pu!" Sun Miechen's golden form was pierced by the countless feathers, blood spilling from his body.

The feather storm lasted thirty breaths, and Sun Miechen's body was torn apart by the golden feathers. His flesh and blood scattered, a sight of utter despair.

"Too tragic!" Luo Tian sighed deeply before moving toward the golden feather prison, striking it with a punch and shattering it. Waves of earth-shaking power swept around him, even Luo Tian being cautious not to confront it directly.

As he moved through the chaos, Luo Tian reached Sun Miechen's scattered flesh and blood, sighing deeply.
