"Alright, First Sect Master, let's head to the Supreme Sacrifice Altar!" Several seven-source immortals said with excitement, seeing Luo Tian deep in thought. They urged him, "Come on!"

"Alright!" Though Luo Tian was deeply puzzled, he had no clear clues. He nodded slightly and gazed at the winding path ahead, stepping forward as the vanguard of the group.

Luo Tian took a step and pulled his female disciple in front of him, saying, "Follow me closely!"

Seeing Luo Tian unharmed, the others smiled and trailed behind him.

Though he knew the way, Luo Tian deliberately slowed his pace. Purple light was unusually conspicuous in the gray mist.

"Roar..." With his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes activated, Luo Tian could clearly see countless残魂 (residual souls) constantly tearing and devouring each other, while others remained unaware.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian's eyes flickered with contemplation as if verifying an idea in his mind. He took a step, leading the group off the correct path into the territory of an unknown残魂 faction.

"Roar..." A series of low roars echoed in their ears, causing people to tremble. A two-source immortal was instantly engulfed by countless残魂.

"Damn it! What path are you leading us on?!" A seven-source immortal shouted, fear in his eyes. As a Heaven's Immortal, he couldn't see the path Luo Tian revealed with his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes but could sense the endless danger surrounding them.

"Divine Eye of Heaven!" Sha Cangmang chanted with one hand, sending a stream of seals into the foreheads of everyone.

"This is..." As the seals took effect, people finally saw their surroundings, faces filled with shock. Even Sha Cangmang looked stunned.

Though they didn't see the path to the altar, they saw countless残魂 surrounding them.

Countless残魂 surged toward them, causing people to tremble in fear.

"You've done it! This isn't leading us but straight to death!" A seven-source immortal snarled at Luo Tian, teeth clenched.

"Break through! This far is already a good start. When we're prepared, we'll re-enter!" Sha Cangmang slapped his hand, sending eight sources of essence to scatter the countless souls into wisps of ash.

But in an instant, more残魂 surged toward them, faces grim.

Others' gazes turned icy toward Luo Tian, glaring at him as if wanting to retreat.

"Wait! Follow me!" Luo Tian shattered the残魂 before him, calling out as he pulled his female disciple and headed toward another path.

Chapter 787: Immortal Bridge

"Still daring to lead us?!" A seven-source immortal sneered, shouting. He shattered several souls before joining the others.

"Believe me or not, it's your choice!" Luo Tian's face was cold. He had no fondness for these people, but he feared what might happen ahead. Otherwise, he wouldn't care about their fates.

After saying that, Luo Tian ignored them and led his only female disciple toward the残魂 of the Tianyuan Continent. Thunder crackled around him, protecting them as he stepped forward and appeared on the other side of the path.

"Trust you once more!" Sha Cangmang said, biting his teeth. Though he could lead them out now, he wouldn't give up on going deeper. Especially since he believed with his presence, Luo Tian wouldn't dare deceive him.

Sha Cangmang's body shimmered as he wrapped the group in his essence, following Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." With one step, their figures followed Luo Tian to the other side of the path.

"Damn it, this place is also full of残魂!" The injured Dou Jiande looked grim as he emerged on the other side.

As they entered the path's other side, the残魂 of the Tianyuan Continent also fiercely attacked.

A four-source immortal was caught off guard and instantly devoured by the残魂, losing all his flesh and spiritual energy.

Luo Tian led his female disciple, looking puzzled. He wasn't attacked by the残魂, feeling a sense of familiarity with them.

"Home... take us home..." Thoughts flooded Luo Tian's mind, making his heart tremble. His gaze softened.

"Why aren't you attacked?!" Someone noticed the残魂 surrounding Luo Tian but not attacking him.

Others also saw the残魂 ignoring Luo Tian, faces filled with disbelief.

"I promised you. If I become supreme, I'll lead your souls back to Tianyuan!" Luo Tian's face softened as he spoke gently, his voice filled with soothing intent.

As Luo Tian's words ended, the surrounding残魂 showed respect. Even those attacking Sha Cangmang stopped. Deep within the continent, several powerful entities comparable to nine-source beings also radiated gentleness, regarding Luo Tian as a descendant.

"This残魂 has the aura of the Tianyuan Continent!" Sha Cangmang muttered, his face filled with disbelief. His gaze toward Luo Tian changed.

Hearing Sha Cangmang's words, others' faces shifted slightly, as if recalling something, their expressions filled with disbelief.

"How is this possible?!" Dou Jiande's eyes widened. Even his previous injury hadn't shocked him this much.

The aura of the Tianyuan Continent didn't harm those from it. Thus, Luo Tian must have a significant connection to the continent. Others might not know the truth, but among those present, some knew about the Tianyuan Continent's sealing.

In Sha Cangmang's perception, there was only one person from the Tianyuan Continent - Luo Tian.

Sha Cangmang and others were stunned. They hadn't expected this person to be Luo Tian. Sha Cangmang couldn't fathom how, in such circumstances, Luo Tian had survived and become the ultimate winner.

"Recognized!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered with a smile, gazing at Sha Cangmang and others, waiting for their decision. If they turned on him, he wouldn't fear anyone here, not even Sha Cangmang.

"Enough... enough..." Sha Cangmang sighed deeply, saying "enough" several times. At this moment, Luo Tian had become no longer simple. In such circumstances, he had managed to turn the tide, showing Luo Tian wasn't as simple as he seemed.

At that time, Sha Cangmang himself hadn't had any chance of survival. How could Luo Tian, weaker than him at that time, have survived?

"Why did you deliberately lead us astray?!" A seven-source immortal shouted angrily.

His words had barely finished when he felt his misfortune. Others also subtly stepped back from him, even Dou Jiande and others kept their distance.

"Silence!" Luo Tian suddenly turned to the seven-source immortal, his face cold.

At that moment, the entire Sheng Shen Continent roared with thunderous sounds. The screams echoed through heaven and earth. The残魂 of the Tianyuan Continent howled wildly, looking at that seven-source immortal as if he were an enemy. It seemed only Luo Tian's command would make them rush to devour him.

"This..." The seven-source immortal trembled, feeling countless coldness. He felt the疯狂残魂's power, as if his life and death were in Luo Tian's hands.

"Luo Tian, a slight punishment will suffice. We all seek the supreme!" Sha Cangmang spoke directly, calling Luo Tian by name instead of referring to him as the First Sect Master.

Hearing Sha Cangmang's words, those unaware of Luo Tian's true identity looked in disbelief at the man standing there like an emperor.

"Didn't the rumors say Luo Tian was possessed by the First Sect Master? Why does the Sect Master still call him Luo Tian?" Doubts arose among those unaware.

The few attendants wearing the Binding Spirit Band looked delighted, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

Luo Tian's remaining female disciple had a gleam in her eyes, looking at Luo Tian with admiration. She hadn't expected Luo Tian to have been possessed by the First Sect Master. If given the chance, she would willingly submit.

"From now on, I'll speak! Don't interfere. Otherwise, I don't suggest the Qinglong Sect loses a seven-source Heaven's Immortal!" Luo Tian sneered, not denying his name. His gaze fell on the old man.

At the same time, Luo Tian looked at Dou Jiande and others, coldly saying, "And you all, don't provoke me!"

Dou Jiande and the others took a deep breath, smiling slightly as they bowed to Luo Tian without arguing.

"Can he hold back?" Luo Tian's eyebrows furrowed slightly as he glanced at the four.

Others watching this scene felt amazed. Among the Four Sacred Star Domains, people who could scold them like this were few and far between. Yet this Luo Tian did so without hesitation, even making the four dare not retort. This was astonishing.

"Respected ancestors, wait for me. I'll definitely lead you back when I become supreme!" Luo Tian bowed to the countless残魂, then took his disciple and stepped onto the correct path.

Sha Cangmang and others followed closely behind, cautious as they walked toward the Supreme Sacrifice Altar.

Time passed slowly. Under Luo Tian's guidance, they traveled for a day without incident, drawing closer to the Supreme Sacrifice Altar.

But now a bridge blocked their path. To others, it was just a bridge. But to Luo Tian, it was one made of corpses, countless bodies stacked upon each other. Each corpse radiated powerful fluctuations. These corpses hadn't rotted for so long, clearly not ordinary.

On the other side of the bridge, people could vaguely see a massive altar floating in their vision, making them thrilled.

"Immortal Corpse Bridge!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered with emotion. The undecaying flesh clearly wasn't ordinary.

"What's wrong? This bridge has something strange?" Sha Cangmang asked, feeling something off but still asking Luo Tian.

Luo Tian truthfully explained the situation on the bridge to everyone.

"It's not hard. You! Go ahead!" A seven-source immortal ordered a subordinate two-source immortal.

"This..." The subordinate's face darkened. Even Luo Tian and Sha Cangmang, great beings, hadn't dared to go first. Sending him was clearly seeking death.

But he had no choice. His face turned iron-gray as he stepped to the center of the crowd, then took a step onto the Immortal Corpse Bridge.

"One... two..." The subordinate walked a few steps, feeling it was normal. His face relaxed slightly.

But when he let his guard down, two withered hands shot out from the corpse mountain, grabbing his thigh and tearing it apart. The two-source immortal couldn't resist at all, being torn in half. His blood was absorbed by the bridge, and his body became part of the Immortal Bridge. His soul was shredded by a strange fluctuation, turning into ash and being absorbed into the river below.

"This is the River of Death!" Luo Tian looked at the familiar river beneath the Immortal Bridge, his face shocked. This River of Death was similar to the one he'd seen in the Xian Gu Continent, but it was dozens of times more terrifying.

"You go again!" The seven-source immortal frowned, looking at the subordinate behind him and throwing him onto the Immortal Bridge.

The subordinate's face darkened. Looking at the bridge stretching tens of thousands of feet, he instinctively trembled. The previous subordinate hadn't gone far before dying on the bridge. Now it was his turn, and he would surely die.

"Left eight feet!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in their ears as the subordinate trembled, looking at Luo Tian.

He bit his teeth. If he didn't go, the others wouldn't let him live. If he wandered aimlessly, it would be death. Plus, the subordinate's trust in Luo Tian made him instinctively believe.

His face showed determination, sweat pouring down as he stepped carefully in the direction Luo Tian indicated.

"Nothing's wrong!" People felt relief when the subordinate had walked eight feet, especially the one on the bridge who looked at Luo Tian with gratitude and bowed slightly.

"Follow his path, walk where he walked!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered with purple light as he told Sha Cangmang and others.

The group smiled, secretly thinking how correct their choice of bringing Luo Tian was. If not for him, they wouldn't have made it through the mist.

Twenty-some people walked carefully on the Immortal Bridge, waiting for Luo Tian's next command.

Luo Tian led his disciple on the bridge again and said, "Left upper six feet!"

The subordinate, having trusted once before, showed no fear this time and walked where Luo Tian commanded.

"Upper right three feet... back seven feet..." A series of commands came from Luo Tian's mouth. The group walked carefully on the bridge.

Time passed slowly. Under Luo Tian's guidance, they reached halfway across the bridge. The scenery became clearer, and a city appeared in the distance, also shrouded in gray mist. Within it stood a massive altar, visible with golden seals flowing on it, clearly distinct.

"Supreme Sacrifice Altar!" People's faces showed excitement as they looked at the distant altar, wanting to speed up but not daring to move. In their journey, someone had accidentally taken a wrong step and was torn apart, blood staining the Immortal Bridge.

Moreover, as they delved deeper, the strength of the corpses beneath them grew stronger. Now after walking fifteen thousand feet, the corpses had reached five-source immortal strength.

They walked carefully, their excitement growing as they approached the city. No one wanted to die on the way. The Supreme was a level all cultivators in the Four Sacred Star Domains desired. No one wanted to die halfway.

Throughout the journey, Luo Tian's face showed a hint of fatigue. The Purple Extreme Demon Eyes clearly took a toll on him.

Time passed another half-day. They finally reached the city with no incidents, just one thousand feet away.

"Buzz..." The fluctuation of energy sounded. Luo Tian's eyes lost their purple light, his gaze showing a hint of regret.

Yes, the Purple Extreme Demon Eyes had disappeared. The long-term use made Luo Tian unable to sustain it.

"What's wrong?" The crowd paused, their eyes on Luo Tian, wondering why he stopped giving commands.

When they saw his eyes return to normal, their faces changed. They realized it was probably because the Purple Extreme Demon Eyes had run out.

Sha Cangmang's face also darkened. Just one thousand feet away, normally he could reach it with a thought. Yet now, even with the strength of those who had shaken their feet in the Four Sacred Star Domains, they were helpless.

"To use it again, I need half a month!" Luo Tian sighed, looking at Sha Cangmang.

Half a month was not enough for their one-month journey. Even after crossing the bridge, there was still the city to traverse. Who knew how long that would take.

"What level is the corpses beneath the bridge now?" Sha Cangmang asked, his eyes showing decisiveness. He had already calculated to break out.

"Seven-source Heaven's Immortal!" Luo Tian said, causing people's faces to show shock and despair.

Sha Cangmang's eyes flashed with sharpness. He looked at the one thousand feet distance. Seven-source immortal strength, he could still handle it. Though there were many, they were just lifeless objects. If they fought with all their might, they still had a chance.

"Break through!" Sha Cangmang thought for a moment and ordered Dou Jiande and the seven-source immortal guarding Sheng Shen Continent.

"Good!" The temptation of Supreme was irresistible. If they succeeded, these people would be the top group in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Even the four major sects would tremble under their feet.

"Since your Purple Extreme Demon Eyes are gone, you have no purpose here!" The seven-source immortal who had been scolded by Luo Tian said with a mocking smile.

"Langzi Zhen?" Luo Tian looked at the seven-source immortal, his face cold. "Are you turning on me now?"

But Sha Cangmang didn't move, obviously not wanting to get involved. Though Luo Tian was only a six-source immortal, his strength surpassed seven-source immortals. If they captured Luo Tian now, it would definitely weaken their strength.

"Old Langzi, let him go. Supreme is important!" Dou Jiande looked grateful, thinking Langzi Zhen was acting on his behalf for the injury.

"Kill him. You don't need to do it!" Langzi Zhen smiled, looking at everyone with a mocking expression. He formed seals with his hands, sending out terrifying fluctuations.

At the same time, Dou Jiande and others frowned slightly. They felt Langzi Zhen was different from the one they knew.

"Roar..." Terrifying fluctuations spread across the Immortal Bridge. A white tiger shadow flew out from Langzi Zhen's hands.

"This is the White Tiger Sect's technique. How could Langzi Zhen..." Sha Cangmang and others were stunned, looking at the fierce Langzi Zhen.

As people were confused, the white tiger shadow exploded. A thick stream of essence transformed into a misty cloud.

The mist cleared, revealing two figures who made people's faces shocked.

"Jin Yongsi, Ke Zhen Tian!" Luo Tian's eyes showed seriousness as he looked at the two emerging from the mist.

" How did you...?" Sha Cangmang's face also changed, then looked coldly at Langzi Zhen.

"You're a spy!" Sha Cangmang hadn't expected that Langzi Zhen, who held high status in Qinglong Sect, was a spy for the two sects.

Normally, having one or two spies in other sects was common. Like Qinglong Sect had many spies in other sects too.

But having a spy of such high status was impossible. At their level, there were no conditions that could make them move.

"Sha Cangmang, how did you not expect us to appear?" Jin Yongsi smiled at Sha Cangmang. Ke Zhen Tian also looked at him with mockery.

"Langzi Ping, why did you do this? I've always considered your status in Qinglong Sect second only to me. Why did you become a spy for their two sects?" Sha Cangmang's face showed anger, looking at Langzi Ping and shouting.

"Sorry, my real name isn't Langzi Ping. It's Jin Yonglin. You know why!" Langzi Ping looked playful, looking at Sha Cangmang.

"Old Sha, don't be surprised. We're not targeting you this time but him! You must have known his identity as a person from the Tianyuan Continent. This kid can't be left alive, otherwise it would harm our four sects' reputation!"

"After we deal with this kid, let's go into the Supreme Sacrifice Altar together. I'm sure without Purple Extreme Demon Eyes, Luo Tian isn't much use to you anymore!" Ke Zhen Tian said, his eyes cold.

"Kill me?" Luo Tian's face turned cold. His body surged with power, transforming into a streak of light toward the old man now called Jin Yonglin.

Luo Tian's goal was simple: to take a hostage. He knew Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian's strength. He wasn't their match now.

This Jin Yonglin clearly had a close relationship with Jin Yongsi. If he captured him, he'd have a chance.

Seeing Luo Tian rushing toward him, Jin Yonglin's face changed. He surged forward, sending out a palm of dark essence. The entire gray Sheng Shen Continent dimmed.

"This Langzi Ping was hiding his strength. His power has already surpassed us four!" Dou Jiande and others looked surprised, still calling Jin Yonglin Langzi Ping.

"What if he fully unleashed it?" Luo Tian scoffed, but wasn't careless. If he didn't capture Langzi Ping, he'd be in real danger.

Luo Tian immediately unleashed six sources of essence. Spatial essence and lightning attribute essence directly acted on his feet, making him appear in front of Jin Yonglin instantly. The Life and Death essence exploded, a punch striking Jin Yonglin's black hand.

The sound of thunder echoed. The Immortal Bridge trembled under their collision, dark energy spreading.

"Really strong!" Jin Yonglin's face showed surprise. He knew he wasn't a match, so he retreated.

But Jin Yonglin forgot it was the Immortal Bridge made of corpses. As he retreated, several pale hands shot out from the bridge, rushing toward him at a visible speed.

"Damn it!" Blocked by several hands, Jin Yonglin cursed. He looked at Luo Tian who had arrived close.

Chapter 789: The Mouth of the River Beast

Luo Tian's speed was极致, appearing in front of Jin Yonglin. He changed his punch into a grab to subdue him.

But at that moment, two terrifying fluctuations sounded behind Luo Tian. He reversed his body and appeared elsewhere.

"Kid, do you think we two are just decorations?!" Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian looked mocking, appearing in front of Jin Yonglin. At the same time, their feet rose a pair of old hands to grab them.

"Go away..." They sneered and stomped on the Immortal Bridge, producing a clear sound. Those old hands were crushed into bloodstains and absorbed back into the bridge.

"Roar..." Affected by the fluctuations of Luo Tian's group, the River of Death below the bridge roared.

"Rippling..." Water splashed. A beast wrapped in gray mist emerged from the River of Death, appearing in people's vision.

The beast had eight heads. Upon closer inspection, it had gray scales with faces on each scale, howling with fierce expressions.

"This is a River Beast! I didn't expect such creatures to exist in the world!" Sha Cangmang's heart trembled, his face filled with shock as he looked at the eight-headed beast writhing in the River of Death.

Luo Tian was also stunned, his face filled with disbelief. According to legends, the River of Death had a chance to produce a River Beast. River Beasts were born by devouring残魂, and the endless残魂 in the river water was clearly a good place for their birth. To this day, people didn't know how River Beasts appeared.

"Eight-source Heaven's Immortal strength!" People estimated the beast's power, their faces filled with shock.

"Legends were correct. It's said that for each additional head, the beast gains one source of Heaven's Immortal strength. If it grows to nine heads, it would be a nine-source Heaven's Immortal!" Dou Jiande said, his face shocked as he looked at the eight-source Heaven's Immortal beast.

"Its ninth head is about to grow!" A seven-source immortal said, looking at the protrusion next to the beast's eight heads and shouting.

"This River Beast's strength must be comparable to the three eight-source Heaven's Immortals here!" People felt amazed, looking at Sha Cangmang standing there and comparing their strengths.

"Ha ha, kid, I see you running nowhere!" A laugh echoed in people's ears. A battered figure slammed into the bridge, producing a thunderous sound.

"Luo Tian!" People's faces showed shock as they saw that battered figure.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's lips bled, his face fierce as he looked at Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian. Their strength was too powerful. In just a brief fight, he had already suffered considerable injuries. This was only because of himself; if it were any seven-source immortal, they would have already died in their hands.

"Qinglong Sacred Body truly lives up to its name. Our two full-strength attacks only left you with minor injuries. Pity, such a terrifying body would be a shame to kill. Kid, I'll give you another chance. Give me this body for possession, and I'll find another corpse for you. From now on, you'll serve me under the White Tiger Sect and Vermilion Phoenix Sect."

"You!" Hearing Jin Yongsi's words, Sha Cangmang's eyebrows furrowed slightly. It seemed Jin Yongsi had grouped the White Tiger Sect and Vermilion Phoenix Sect together.

"Old Sha, yes. We've formed an alliance. Do you want to join? If anyone becomes the Supreme first, they'll be the leader of the Four Sacred Sects alliance!" Jin Yongsi smiled at Sha Cangmang.

"No interest!" Sha Cangmang said, addressing the Qinglong Sect members behind him: "Those with five-source or higher Heaven's Immortal strength, follow me to the Supreme Sacrifice Altar. The rest stay here and wait for us!"

Sha Cangmang spoke, opening the way with eight sources of essence. He stepped forward with his group of over ten people toward the bridge's end, leaving about ten Qinglong Sect disciples and attendants standing on the bridge, confused.

It wasn't that Sha Cangmang didn't want to take them. The path ahead was too dangerous. Without the correct way, they would be dead if they went. Staying behind gave them a chance.

"Master, are you abandoning Luo Tian?" People looked puzzled. Though Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian were strong, with Luo Tian plus four seven-source immortals, they weren't afraid of an eight-source immortal. People didn't understand why Sha Cangmang treated Luo Tian so coldly, despite him leading them this far and being such a genius. To abandon him like that.

"Hmph..." Ke Zhen Tian sneered, looking at Sha Cangmang walking away. At this point, the White Tiger Sect and Vermilion Phoenix Sect's alliance had completely surpassed Qinglong Sect in strength. If no one achieved nine-source or Supreme, Sha Cangmang would have no choice but to comply.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian and Jin Yongsi collided again, producing a thunderous sound. With Ke Zhen Tian's attack removed, Luo Tian felt better but still wasn't a match for Jin Yongsi.

"Boom..." In the collision, Luo Tian's body slammed against the bridge again. The powerful impact even collapsed parts of the bridge, each stone turning into a crystalline corpse and falling into the River of Death.

"Roar..." The gray river roiled. The River Beast's eyes glowed with ferocity, swallowing the corpses and looking satisfied.

"Buzz..." Gray mist spread from the protrusion about to become the ninth head. People were shocked to see it had grown slightly, though not much, but visible.

"Kid, if you don't want to become the River Beast's food, do as I say. Otherwise, your only path is death!" Jin Yongsi smiled at Luo Tian.

If not for the mystery of this Sheng Shen Continent, fearing too much disturbance, Luo Tian would have already been a corpse.

"Crack..." Luo Tian slowly stood up, adjusting his displaced joints. His face showed contempt.

"It seems you're refusing to take the hint!" Jin Yongsi's face filled with killing intent. Eight sources of essence surged out, carrying overwhelming power as he slammed toward Luo Tian.

"Crushing Mountain Technique!" Luo Tian waved his hand, a gray mountain descending from the sky toward Jin Yongsi's massive hand.

"You really think you're important? A mere A-grade martial technique with essence, it's not worthy of boasting before me!" Jin Yongsi sneered. He formed another hand seal, creating a source-hand to grab the gray mountain.

"Boom..." The terrifying mountain was crushed by Jin Yongsi's source-hand, turning into chaotic essence that dissipated above the Immortal Bridge.

"Boom..." At the same time, Luo Tian's body collided with Jin Yongsi's other source-hand. He spat blood and slammed against the bridge railing, breaking it and falling into the River of Death with the corpses.

"Roar..." The River Beast roared, looking at Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian with gratitude. All eight heads opened, preparing to catch the corpses falling from the bridge, among which was Luo Tian.

At this moment, Luo Tian's condition was poor. Jin Yongsi had used his full strength in the last attack, leaving him severely injured.

Though his injuries were serious, Luo Tian could still fly up. Compared to facing Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian, he preferred this River Beast.

Luo Tian's eyes showed fierce determination. There was no other way now. He moved his feet, transforming into a streak of blue light and diving into one of the River Beast's mouths.

"Suicide!" Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian looked mocking, watching Luo Tian dive into the beast's mouth.

"Go. Entering the River Beast's mouth, this kid is definitely dead! Let's go out first. If Sha Cangmang reaches the Supreme Sacrifice Altar before us, we'll be in a passive position!" Ke Zhen Tian said, looking at the ancient altar in the distance. His face showed eagerness.

They didn't care about Sha Cangmang's people on the bridge. One, these people were of average strength and status in Qinglong Sect. In their eyes, they had no value at all. Two, the Four Sacred Star Domains were still dominated by four major forces. Killing these people without reason would cause unnecessary trouble.

Under the Qinglong Sect disciples' eyes, Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian moved their bodies, emitting fierce energy like a giant beast. They pushed forward.

"Luo Tian is dead! This time it's really dead!"
"Unexpectedly, he survived even after being possessed by the First Sect Master but died on the Immortal Bridge!" Qinglong Sect disciples murmured, their faces filled with admiration as they stood on the bridge without moving.

Among them was a woman trembling, tears flowing from her eyes. She was Luo Tian's previous female disciple.

They stood staring at each other on the bridge, then looked at the massive River Beast in the river. It had swallowed Luo Tian and those corpses. The ninth head grew even more.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt very uncomfortable. After transforming into a streak of light and diving into the beast's stomach, unlike those lifeless corpses, he was constantly moving within the massive beast's body. He searched for a place to temporarily land.

But the River Beast also noticed Luo Tian's presence, wouldn't let him run around in its body.

Chapter 790: The Path of Time

Under the Immortal Bridge, the River of Death surged endlessly. A massive beast floated on the water, its eight eyes looking at the Qinglong Sect disciples and attendants on the bridge with greed.
