……
Luo Tian had just blocked the massive seal, when a golden hand descended upon him with overwhelming pressure, causing his lips to twitch.

"Manifesting the Dao's Form and Heaven!" Luo Tian waved his hands, his body exploding in size to a thousand zhang. His colossal divine form was instantly crushed against his back by the golden seal.

"Ha! Ha!" His massive body bent, Luo Tian coughed up blood, ignoring his injuries as he lunged toward Zhi Hong with a brutal step—Bitter Seven Steps. Sacrificing his own strength for an offensive opportunity, this was Luo Tian's way to turn the tide. His thick foot descended from above, causing Zhi Hong's expression to shift slightly; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to resort to such a move.

"Is that all you've got?" Zhi Hong's hands moved swiftly, unleashing martial techniques one after another.

Boom! Boom! Boom...
In an instant, five thunderous collisions shook the seventy-first layer. The space trembled violently as Luo Tian took five steps, clashing with Zhi Hong's five techniques. Both men retreated repeatedly. Bitter Seven Steps combined with Luo Tian's enhanced flesh was enough to threaten even an early-stage Immortal King. Zhi Hong spat blood, his gaze filled with disbelief as he stared at Luo Tian's overwhelming strength.

"Divine Bitter Seven Steps!" The sixth step unleashed a quake of heaven and earth, and after his flesh strengthened, Luo Tian could now endure the side effects of Bitter Seven Steps.

With a single step forward, heaven and earth changed color, causing Zhi Hong's face to twist in alarm. On that massive foot, he felt a life-or-death crisis.

"Unbreakable Golden Body!" Zhi Hong roared, realizing he had to fight with all his might. A chant echoed as a string of runes spilled from his mouth, encircling him and coating his body in golden light.

"Golden Buddha Fist!" Zhi Hong recited a sutra, and a golden phantom formed behind him. As the heavens roared, he struck with a fist. The clash of fists and feet erupted into an explosion that shook the heavens, sending Luo Tian flying backward while Zhi Hong's body also retreated.

"Spit..." Luo Tian coughed blood, his gaze locking onto Zhi Hong's radiant form. The confrontation had given him no advantage; it felt as if he were standing on the ground.

"Little brat, do you think only you have enhancements? Though Mount Xu Mi is secluded, it doesn't mean we are the weakest among the Nine Immortal Mountains. We just don’t seek conflict!" Zhi Hong sneered, unharmed as he leapt into the air again. The golden phantom reformed behind him and struck Luo Tian with another fist.

"Is this really so strong?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, feeling himself swell again—now facing an early-stage Immortal King.

"The Heavenly Demon's Body Dissolution is currently unusable; by the time I could use it, Zhi Hong would have already crushed me!" Luo Tian took another Bitter Seven Steps to clash with Zhi Hong's fist, his body flying backward again. Yet Zhi Hong remained unscathed.

"Poison Needles!" Luo Tian observed Zhi Hong's golden body, recalling the massive drum that had once tormented him. Though he couldn't move it then, he'd pierced it with a single strike. This situation mirrored that moment; Luo Tian thought of another powerful technique.

"Old fool, if you have the Unbreakable Golden Body, I'll test it with these needles!" Luo Tian muttered internally. He took another step forward to clash with Zhi Hong, and an explosion erupted again. Luo Tian spat blood once more, but this time, as he flew backward, he waved his hand. One hundred and eight streaks of light vanished in an instant.

"Hmm?" Zhi Hong was startled, sensing the black glimmers before him. Yet he dismissed them, believing his Unbreakable Golden Body rendered all attacks useless.

"Kill him this time!" Zhi Hong sneered, his golden phantom clenching a fist and pressing toward Luo Tian.

"Must hit!" Luo Tian shouted internally, his heart pounding as Zhi Hong charged toward him.

"Spit! Spit! Spit..." As Zhi Hong took steps, he felt pain in several places. Seeing the black needles, his face twisted with disdain.

"Trivial tricks!" Zhi Hong scoffed, but before he could finish his words, his face turned pale.

"Ah..." The next moment, searing pain invaded Zhi Hong's entire body. Corrosive intent spread from all directions, even eroding the golden phantom behind him.

"Little brat, you used poison! What kind of toxin is this?" Zhi Hong roared, his cultivation power struggling to counter the poison. The golden runes on his body faded under the corrosive intent, and his golden light dimmed drastically.

"Divine Bitter Seven Steps!" Luo Tian's eyes turned icy, seizing the opportunity to strike. His black leg descended toward Zhi Hong, deepening his grim expression.

Adding insult to injury, this step forced Zhi Hong to confront a life-threatening crisis. The corrosive intent's strength was unprecedented, and Luo Tian's foot compelled Zhi Hong to use all his skills.

"Spit..." Zhi Hong spat golden blood, his body glowing red as he took steps toward the exit of the seventy-first layer. He knew he had to eliminate the toxin quickly; otherwise, it would be a major隐患 and he'd surely lose to Luo Tian.

Chapter 2370: Exchange of Fates
"Trying to escape?" Luo Tian watched Zhi Hong flee desperately, his eyes flashing cold. His colossal divine form stood at the exit of the seventy-first layer, hands moving swiftly as prison-like ghost claws emerged from thin air to grasp Zhi Hong.

Zhi Hong roared continuously, the prison-like ghost claws could harm him but were insignificant. What enraged him was the toxin within his body. Even as he channeled his cultivation power, it could only briefly resist the corrosive intent.

"What kind of toxin is this?" Zhi Hong roared internally, striking the prison-like ghost claws.

"Boom..." The prison-like ghost claws disintegrated, but Zhi Hong's body was also blocked at the exit. Luo Tian's massive form stood like a mountain, leaving no chance for Zhi Hong to escape.

Luo Tian had once been blocked by Zhi Hong; if he hadn't taken those monks as hostages, he wouldn’t have escaped. Now their roles were reversed—Luo Tian guarded the exit while Zhi Hong relentlessly attacked to break through the seventy-first layer and find a way out.

"Damned..." Zhi Hong roared repeatedly, but the toxin had him at five percent strength. He couldn’t defeat Luo Tian and was even suppressed, coughing up blood.

"Primordial Qi Unification!" Zhi Hong bellowed, his body radiating a terrifying aura. Luo Tian's eyes narrowed as he clearly saw an energy swirling within Zhi Hong’s body. Zhi Hong's face was even paler, but the energy grew stronger until his mouth began to swell.

"Spit..." Reaching a critical point, Zhi Hong suddenly erupted, spewing a river of crimson blood. The intense aura made Luo Tian's face shift slightly.

The crimson torrent surged, its overwhelming pressure shaking Luo Tian’s mind. Within it was an aura that made him fear. Spitting out the crimson river, Zhi Hong's body withered as if he'd expelled his own blood.

"Last resort?" Luo Tian muttered internally, knowing he couldn’t withstand the crimson torrent’s impact. Even if he could block it, he’d suffer heavy injuries. He had no choice but to retreat, his massive body stepping away from the exit of the seventy-first layer.

As Luo Tian’s body vanished, the crimson river collided with the barrier of the seventy-first layer.

Heaven and earth roared; in an instant, a shocking sight emerged—the exit, originally less than a hundred zhang wide, was directly torn open by the crimson river. The torrent pierced through the barrier, creating a thousand-zhang opening that made Luo Tian’s eyes widen in fear. At the same time, he felt relieved; if he had used his flesh to block it, he might have lost more than just skin.

"Little brat, this isn’t over!" Zhi Hong’s roar echoed as he transformed into a streak of light and rushed into the seventy-second layer.

"His strength is now inferior to mine; this is the best chance to kill him!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He leapt into the seventy-second layer, but as he was about to exit through the opening torn by the crimson river, his body stopped.

"Though I can fight an early-stage Immortal King now, it's extremely difficult!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, his eyes fierce. He moved his hands, and a series of demonic patterns flew out, encircling his body.

He planned to use Heavenly Demon's Body Dissolution and push straight through to the eightieth layer. After all, what lay ahead might be the difficulty of an early-stage Immortal King; he had no great confidence. With the artifact spirit's nature, he might be in grave danger.

Crackling sounds echoed as demonic patterns were etched onto his body. His aura surged again, and after an hour, it stabilized at the level of an early-stage Immortal King. His flesh strength had even reached that of a mid-stage Immortal King.

The only regret was his lack of a domain, but this strength was enough to crush most early-stage Immortal Kings.

"Powerful feeling, truly good! Next time I meet Zhi Hong, I must use Heavenly Demon's Body Dissolution. But all that will have to wait until the eightieth layer!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, Zhi Hong no longer in his eyes. Now, his greatest enemy was the artifact spirit.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt confident that if he met Zhi Hong again, with his current state, he could kill him within an hour.

"Next, my enemies are the artifact spirit and time. My current state should last five hours; I must reach the eightieth layer within that time!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with ruthless intent. He knew if he didn’t be harsh on himself, he wouldn’t survive the artifact spirit’s challenges.

"Wow... this brat still has tricks!" The artifact spirit, seeing Luo Tian’s strength rise again, was shocked and spoke aloud. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have such a technique.

"Damned, I won’t be able to kill him before the eightieth layer!" The artifact spirit shouted in anger. His authority was limited to before the eightieth layer; once past it, he couldn’t control him. However, for these reasons, the artifact spirit could do nothing but helplessly watch. He had no right to stop Luo Tian from passing through the layers, nor could he have a reason to personally kill him.

"Buzz..." While the artifact spirit was shocked, Luo Tian didn’t know his thoughts and stepped into the slowly healing exit of the seventy-first layer.

The scene shifted, Luo Tian’s figure appearing in the seventy-second layer. In the vast expanse of stars, he took a step forward and gazed around.

"Roar..." Stars converged as a massive beast roared, appearing in Luo Tian’s view. An early-stage Immortal King's strength made Luo Tian frown slightly.

With a thunderous roar, the starry beast charged toward Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian didn’t care about anything and rushed forward with a fist.

"Boom..." The stars trembled, the cosmos shattered, and Luo Tian stood firmly beneath the stars. The starry beast flew backward with a scream, its massive body cracking apart.

"I’m so strong!" Luo Tian laughed loudly, his flesh being invincible as he charged toward the starry beast.

Boom! Boom!
Thunderous sounds echoed beneath the stars as Luo Tian delivered eight punches, instantly reducing the starry beast to fragments that vanished before his eyes. Starlight scattered and coalesced into a star sword, landing in Luo Tian’s hands.

"An upper-tier immortal artifact?" Luo Tian's eyes lit up, holding the star sword. He hadn’t expected this layer’s reward to be an upper-tier immortal artifact.

In惊喜, Luo Tian vanished beneath the stars and appeared in the seventy-third layer, beginning to push through it.

An hour later, Luo Tian passed the seventy-third layer and collected an eighth-tier elixir, his heart filled with joy.

Seventy-four... seventy-five...
Time flowed slowly; within two hours, Luo Tian reached the seventy-eighth layer.

"This layer..." Luo Tian muttered quietly, gazing at the surroundings of the seventy-eighth layer. His body flickered as he moved.

In his view, a black drum appeared, making Luo Tian’s lips twitch slightly; he had some trauma related to drums.

"Twelve strikes of the spirit, and you can pass; if not, death!" The artifact spirit’s cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Luo Tian could sense the determination in the voice, unsure what difficulty this artifact spirit had added for him.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s spiritual sense surged forward, striking the black drum. For his spiritual sense, he was relatively confident.

"Boom..." A heavy bell sound rang out, and Luo Tian felt a powerful rebound force冲击 his soul, making his face instantly dark.

"Spit..." Blood spewed from Luo Tian’s mouth, his face pale.

"It's impossible to handle..." Luo Tian muttered internally, gazing at the black drum. That powerful rebound force hadn’t just attacked his soul but also his flesh.

"Even an early-stage Immortal King couldn't withstand that rebound!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, estimating he wouldn’t last many more strikes.

"Human and Dao Method!" As he spoke, Luo Tian moved his hands, activating the Human and Dao Method to shield his spiritual sense. He struck the drum again.

"Boom..." The heavy bell sound rang out, and Luo Tian was instantly thrown back, his body violently trembling. His Human and Dao Method was directly shattered, his head pounding with pain, blood spilling from his mouth as he collapsed to the ground.

"Great Heaven's Momentum!" Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief. That brief strike had made him feel a vast heaven pressing down, crushing his body. He knew this was the true Great Heaven's Momentum. And this momentum was essential for ascending to an Immortal King, requiring one to comprehend the Great Heaven's Momentum and form their own domain.

"Though this is dangerous, it’s also my opportunity!" Luo Tian wiped the blood from his mouth and thought. His Human and Dao Method was a prototype of a domain, but it wasn’t yet a true domain.

"Correct! This is indeed the Great Heaven's Momentum, and it can quickly help one form a domain. Compared to what you previously calculated, this is more suitable. Though the little artifact spirit is trying to trouble you, it's also helping!" The voice of the Supplemental Stone echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him startled.

"But such things are hard for ordinary people to endure!" However, the Supplemental Stone’s words made Luo Tian feel a bitter joy.

Chapter 2371: Pushing Forward
"Boom..."
Luo Tian took a breath, then struck the black drum again with his spiritual sense. The heavy bell sound shook the heavens and earth, sending Luo Tian flying back again. His entire body bore fine cracks, as if something were pressing him. His body could clearly be seen deforming for an instant.

"Spit..." Blood spewed from Luo Tian’s mouth like money, and he lay there for dozens of breaths before opening his eyes.

His eyes sparkled with understanding, then shifted to confusion.

"This is only the second strike; I’ll see how you endure twelve!" The artifact spirit’s eyes gleamed with joy, as if he could already see Luo Tian being torn apart.

"Comprehend! Carefully comprehend the grandeur of the Great Heaven's Momentum..." The Supplemental Stone’s voice echoed constantly in Luo Tian’s mind, as if imbued with special power. He focused on comprehending the brief feeling of being crushed by that momentum.

"It's too strong!" Luo Tian muttered internally, continuously analyzing the previous Dao laws and still felt confused after three days.

"Third strike..." Luo Tian roared, striking the black drum again with his spiritual sense.

Fourth strike... fifth strike...
Time flowed slowly, and Luo Tian continuously analyzed and struck. The heavy bell sound echoed under his attacks.
However, the intervals were long; each time he had to recover for a long while. Gradually, his aura strengthened, and an invisible wave surrounded him, as if just formed but gradually becoming stronger.

That aura was similar to the Human and Dao Method, but it was more refined than the latter. The range of two hundred zhang gradually expanded again.

"How is he made? Why doesn’t he die?" The artifact spirit was shocked, watching Luo Tian’s indomitable will. There were times the artifact spirit thought Luo Tian was surely dead, his body nearly shattered, but he eventually recovered.

Seventh strike... eighth strike... The artifact spirit observed Luo Tian constantly, but he was disappointed each time. Luo Tian always looked like he was about to die, yet after ten strikes, he still endured.

However, the time Luo Tian spent was also very long; within a year, he had only struck ten times.

Within that year, Luo Tian’s cultivation reached the edge of an Immortal King. His magic core was very solid; he felt confident that if he mastered a domain and combined the elixirs from the first seventy layers, he could attempt to ascend to an Immortal King.

"Eight hundred zhang!" Luo Tian stood up slowly again, feeling his Human and Dao Method had expanded to eight hundred zhang. His eyes showed joy.

"His suffering wasn’t in vain!" Luo Tian panted, feeling the strength of his Human and Dao Method. Though it wasn’t as good as a domain, it was close enough.

"Again..." Luo Tian roared and struck again. His powerful spiritual sense turned into a tangible force, striking the black drum.

"Boom..." The drum sound echoed in all directions. Luo Tian spat blood again, his body flying backward and colliding with the barrier of the seventy-eighth layer. Blood stained the barrier, and Luo Tian slid down from it.

Like a pile of meat, he fell to the ground, his life force rapidly fading, and his flesh began to crack. Blood spread from Luo Tian’s body outward, while black demonic energy scattered.

"Finished..." The artifact spirit watched Luo Tian turn into a pile of meat, his eyes showing admiration. He could also sense Luo Tian’s weakness and felt somewhat uneasy.

"Buzz..." Just as the artifact spirit thought Luo Tian was about to die, Luo Tian’s wounds began to heal slowly, though the process was unusually slow.

"He still doesn’t die; he’s just barely alive!" The artifact spirit widened his eyes, watching Luo Tian’s life force slowly heal and spoke in disbelief.

"Tenacious! So tenacious!" The artifact spirit’s eyes showed admiration, surprised by Luo Tian’s strong will to survive.

Time flowed slowly; three months passed. The sky was filled with dark clouds, and lightning roamed within them—this was a thunderstorm.

"There’s still..."
"This time, he's truly dead! I won’t control it this time!" The artifact spirit sighed longingly, watching the golden lightning descending from the sky.

"Crack..." Golden thunderbolts fell one after another, their destructive power overwhelming. Twenty-four lightning strikes could kill a half-Immortal King. With Luo Tian’s current state, he couldn’t withstand it.

Dust swirled; Luo Tian's flesh turned into a pile of meat, bones were visible, and lightning power roamed between the bones and flesh.

"Finished..." The artifact spirit watched Luo Tian’s life force completely disappear, sighing longingly. If it weren’t for his obstruction, Luo Tian wouldn’t have died in the seventy-eighth layer.

"Buzz..." Just as the artifact spirit felt Luo Tian had died, a golden light rose from the pile of meat. It roamed within the flesh and began to gather Luo Tian’s body back together.

"What is that golden light?" The artifact spirit saw the golden light on Luo Tian’s body, his eyes showing confusion. He could clearly feel the terrifying power of that golden light, though it was very weak. Just a single thread contained immense power, making him feel terrified.

The golden light flowed on Luo Tian’s body, and his life force gradually recovered. That last breath of life revived again.

Time flowed slowly; another three months passed. Under the golden light’s movement, Luo Tian's flesh finally recovered. The sky again filled with dark clouds, and lightning roamed within them.

"This brat deserves to be struck by thunder!" The artifact spirit watched the dark clouds, his eyes showing admiration.

Light flickered; golden light surged forth. When the golden light rose, the dark clouds surrounding Luo Tian violently trembled, and the golden lightning shattered. The dark clouds dispersed.

"He can’t be provoked! This brat can’t be provoked!" The artifact spirit watched the golden light, which was just a single thread but could repel the thunderstorm. His heart trembled.

A year passed silently. Since the last time the golden light repelled it, the thunderstorm hadn’t appeared again. Luo Tian also slowly opened his eyes and stood up.

"I’ve become stronger!" Luo Tian looked at his flesh, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"You saved me again!" Luo Tian muttered internally, thinking he had already died but the Book of Epochs had saved his last breath, allowing him to recover.

"What are you?" Luo Tian muttered internally, slowly standing up and stretching his body. He looked at the black drum with a hint of fear.

"Nine hundred zhang!" At the same time, Luo Tian felt his Human and Dao Method becoming more complete, even seeing its existence.

"One last strike..." Luo Tian muttered internally. If it weren’t for desperation, he wouldn’t have struck again; it was too painful. If not for the Book of Epochs, he would have died before. He didn’t believe the Book of Epochs would always help him.

"Big brother, save me one more time!" Luo Tian prayed internally. Though his strength had increased, he didn’t believe he could withstand it.

He waved his hand, placing the elixirs he had obtained after the seventieth layer into his mouth. His eyes flashed with ruthlessness.

"Whether it works or not, this is all I have!" Luo Tian roared. He felt a breakthrough aura.

"Boom..." The drum sound shook, the black drum emitting an elegant Dao resonance. Luo Tian stood there, trembling violently before exploding into a pile of bones scattered on the ground.

"Can he die any more?" The artifact spirit trembled, for the first time fearing Luo Tian. Seeing the pile of bones, he felt a sense of spiritual resonance again.

"It's the Creation Light!" The Supplemental Stone also gasped, having been stunned by Luo Tian. Now he realized something; if Luo Tian were here, he would be surprised. This was the first time the Supplemental Stone had been so shocked.

"Damned, this guy..." The Supplemental Stone wanted to speak but closed his mouth, as if something was taboo.

Time passed; this time it took three years. The scattered flesh returned to Luo Tian’s body, reassembling him.

"I’m not dead..." Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, his gaze confused; he truly thought he was dead and had no awareness.

"Boom..." At the moment Luo Tian opened his eyes, his aura reached its peak. A thunderous sound echoed from his body. The effect of the elixirs he had swallowed also took place, spreading throughout his limbs and joints.

"Early-stage Immortal King!" Luo Tian roared lowly, activating the Heart Demon’s Scripture to fiercely refine the elixir power and gather it into his magic core.

Boom! Boom! Boom...
The magic core in Luo Tian’s body roared continuously, and his demonic platform began to grow. It expanded to a nine-zhang phantom, then shrank to the size of a palm, with patterns appearing on it.

"Roar..." At the moment the Dao patterns formed on Luo Tian’s demonic platform, the souls from the sixty-seventh layer began to roar fiercely.

Not only that, but in the Wheel of Rebirth, Luo Tian’s other body also suddenly opened its eyes. Its aura rose as well.

"Is my original self about to ascend to an early-stage Immortal King?" The black-cloaked Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of joy. He waved his hands, and the Yellow River Water surged.

Chapter 2372: Immortal King’s Thunderstorm
"Immortal King's Thunderstorm!" The dark sky gathered again, pressing an oppressive atmosphere onto Luo Tian’s body as if to crush him.

"Is it time to pass the thunderstorm?" Hei Bai Wu Chang (Black and White Death) showed a solemn expression, clearly aware of the importance of an Immortal King’s thunderstorm.

They appeared on the Wheel of Rebirth's wheel, their faces also solemn as they watched Luo Tian.

"Little brat, you’ve trained quickly!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke softly, waved his hands, and invisible waves emerged from his hands. A gray mist was forcibly captured.

"Take a bit of your soul power to prevent you from dying in the Immortal King’s thunderstorm!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke softly, clearly worried.

Luo Tian nodded, watching Hei Bai Wu Chang send that bit of soul power to Fu Xingxuan (Fuxingxuan), placing it in the彼岸花 (Paradise Flower) to nourish. If he truly died, it would take a long time for the Paradise Flower to nurture it back, and Hei Bai Wu Chang would use his methods to reassemble Luo Tian’s body.

"So fast?" Fu Xingxuan stood on the gray long bridge, his eyes showing concern as he watched the Paradise Flower nurturing Luo Tian’s soul power. Beside him stood a tall figure, his eyes filled with reverence—this was the soul that Luo Tian had saved from the Soul Pavilion.

"Little brat, I’ll stay away for a while! This state of mine can’t withstand it!" The Supplemental Stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making his lips twitch.

"Little brat, let me out too!" Before the Supplemental Stone’s words finished, the long-silent Yin Fish's voice also echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

"Everyone, why are you so annoying!" Luo Tian cursed, but he still sent the Yin Fish and the Splitting Heaven Spear to the Supplemental Stone, keeping them far from himself. He knew this Immortal King’s thunderstorm could only be passed by himself.

"Has he entered the Immortal King realm?" The artifact spirit of the照天塔 (Zhao Tian Tower) showed admiration. Now, the seventy-eighth layer was no longer under his control; the entire seventh layer had turned dark.

Storms roared, and Luo Tian stood beneath the clouds, his robe fluttering in the wind. His long hair flew as he gazed at the sky that made his entire body tremble.

"Crack..." A golden lightning bolt fell from the sky, accompanied by a thunderous roar, announcing the start of Luo Tian’s Immortal King’s thunderstorm.

"Roar..." The golden lightning roared, forming a dragon of lightning that rushed toward Luo Tian. It contained the Great Heaven’s Momentum and rushed toward him.

"Go away..." Luo Tian roared, striking with a fist that collided with the golden dragon. That powerful lightning dragon was instantly shattered by Luo Tian’s punch, turning into electricity that entered his body.

"This is also refining..." Luo Tian's body trembled violently, feeling the lightning power striking his magic core’s demonic platform.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderstorm seemed to be angry at Luo Tian's easy destruction of it and sent a blue lightning bolt across the sky. Moreover, a red lightning bolt also erupted simultaneously, intertwining with the blue one and rushing toward Luo Tian.

The destructive atmosphere returned again, making Luo Tian’s face grim; he felt his flesh strength could withstand it, but whether the demonic platform in his magic core could endure was uncertain.

Luo Tian formed a hand seal, unleashing the Prison-like Ghost Claws. A roaring beast revealed its true form, scanning the sky with cold eyes and striking toward the dual-colored lightning.

"Crash..."
The black ghost claws collided with the dual-colored lightning, and the entire sky seemed to explode. The heavens roared as the black beast and dual-colored lightning both shattered, with lightning energy gathering toward Luo Tian.

"Manifesting the Dao's Form and Heaven!" Luo Tian waved his hands, his body exploding in size to a thousand zhang. His body radiated explosive power, allowing the dual-colored lightning to enter his body through his pores.

"Roar..." Luo Tian roared, and eight ghost veins surged, with the Heart Demon’s Scripture rapidly running to stabilize the demonic platform.

The thunderous sound echoed, and storms surged as Luo Tian stood proudly in the world. His body’s demonic platform collided with the dual-colored lightning, and the lightning was directly subdued by the demonic platform. The lightning power transformed into demonic patterns etched onto the demonic platform.

"Come on!" Luo Tian roared, shouting into the sky as he gazed at the swirling thunderclouds. His eyes were filled with battle intent.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian’s words fell, two blood-red eyes凝聚 (concentrated), and the thunderclouds gathered together as if trying to form a human shape. They let out roaring sounds.

"Roar..." The roar echoed, but it seemed to have some shackles preventing it from forming a body. Though it didn’t fully form into a human shape, it did create vague facial features, especially those cold blood-red eyes. Compared to the heavenly eye Luo Tian had seen before, these were more vivid and completely looked down on heaven.

"Crash..." A gray river flowed out from the twisted facial features and transformed into a human figure, holding a gray long sword. It stood in Luo Tian’s view.

Moreover, a series of colorful lightning bolts flew out from the gray thunderclouds, forming a nine-colored human figure with a nine-color lightning sword. It rushed toward Luo Tian.

"What..." Luo Tian’s heart trembled, feeling a powerful pressure from the two human figures. But he could only grit his teeth and fight back; if he passed this Immortal King’s thunderstorm, Luo Tian was confident that whether in the heavenly realm or hell, he would have a place.

Luo Tian held Longyuan Sword in his left hand and Mo Ming Sword in his right, rushing toward the two human figures. In an instant, four swords collided with each other. The heavens continuously exploded, and Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, his swords dancing without gaps. The two human figures were extremely strong; even with Luo Tian’s full power, he was hit and spat blood.

Longyuan and Mo Ming were both world-shattering swords, supernatural beings. Normally, any other treasure would be damaged after colliding with these two swords for a while. However, the gray long sword and nine-color lightning sword remained unscathed.

"This is something formed by heavenly power; it’s enough to torment this brat!" The Supplemental Stone turned into a speck of dust, hovering at the edge of the seventy-eighth layer and watching Luo Tian pass through this Immortal King’s thunderstorm.

"Ordinary people only form one heavenly Dao body, but this brat formed two! He’s even more变态 (abnormal) than my master!" The artifact spirit watched the devastating waves in the seventy-eighth layer.

On another side, in the Wheel of Rebirth, the black-cloaked Luo Tian also faced the same issue. However, it was relatively normal compared to Zhao Tian Tower; only one gray figure continuously fought against Luo Tian. Yet it still roared, making Fu Xingxuan’s eyes show concern.

"Don’t worry; I’m more worried about the main body of that brat. If it can't withstand, it will definitely affect the secondary body; then the secondary body will surely fail!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke softly. The secondary body was already extraordinary, and Hei Bai Wu Chang couldn’t imagine how difficult the main body’s trial would be.

As Hei Bai Wu Chang guessed, Luo Tian was extremely difficult at this moment; the two human figures were invulnerable and their flesh was exceptionally变态 (abnormal), making Luo Tian unsure where to start. He could only passively defend.

In contrast, Luo Tian’s body was made of flesh; although his flesh was strong, the two human figures’ attacks weren’t easy. They hurt Luo Tian’s body genuinely.

Time flowed slowly; three figures continuously clashed for an hour, and Luo Tian's massive divine form was shattered. His entire body was in a mess, and his magic core’s demonic platform dimmed due to massive consumption.

"What should I do? If this continues, I’ll be destroyed in this Immortal King’s thunderstorm!" Luo Tian thought internally about how to destroy the two human figures but had no clue.

"Little brat, this is the heavenly power fighting you; don’t try to destroy it. Try to change your approach and follow the heavenly power!" The Supplemental Stone roared, clearly experienced.

"Heavenly power!" Hearing the Supplemental Stone’s words, Luo Tian's eyes turned icy. He thought of Gu Tian Shu and his past self.

"Follow you? Impossible!" Luo Tian roared, ignited by hatred. He placed the Mo Ming Sword in front of him.

The demonic energy surged, and Luo Tian’s magic core's demonic platform suddenly erupted with a torrent of demonic energy. The demonic energy flowed through Luo Tian’s ghost veins toward the Mo Ming Sword.

"One Strike to Sever Heaven!" The Mo Ming Sword instantly drained all of Luo Tian’s demonic energy, unleashing an unparalleled power.

"Buzz..." The long sword roared, and the black blade’s light suddenly surged, emitting a destructive power that turned into annihilating light. It slashed toward the two human figures.

"This attack..."
"Again this move!" The artifact spirit and Supplemental Stone both spoke at the same time, watching that sky-shaking blade light.
