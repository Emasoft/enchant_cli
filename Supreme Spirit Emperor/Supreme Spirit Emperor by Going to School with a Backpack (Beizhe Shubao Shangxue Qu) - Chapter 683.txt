“Shi Wang, today is your day of death. Why don’t you come up and face it!” Luo Tian stood beside Xuan Bing, his gaze filled with disdain as he looked at Shi Wang.

“You…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Shi Wang, who had just begun to ascend the mountain peak, abruptly halted his body and felt a flicker of fear.

“Xuan Bing is cunning. Perhaps he truly intends to lure me up here to kill me and seize the sword!” Shi Wang thought to himself. He knew what his broken blade was, and anyone would covet it—especially Xuan Bing.

Yet before this, Shi Wang and Xuan Bing had both been wary of each other. Moreover, Xuan Bing seemed to have some reason preventing him from moving, trapped in ice.

“Shi Wang, this kid is tricking you. I only need his life force to sustain myself! I could have killed him already if I were mobile!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Xuan Bing realized Shi Wang had fallen for the trap. At their age, both were cautious—each had survived through special means.

“Xuan Bing, your current strength could definitely kill this kid!” Shi Wang spoke, his gaze fixed on Xuan Bing, eyes brimming with fear.

“Shi Wang, dare you come up!” Luo Tian shouted repeatedly, his gaze locking onto Xuan Bing. He transmitted mentally: “Master, help me drive this fellow away. I’ll go to the treasure vault and free you, okay?”

“Kid, do you think I can’t handle you? Now get off this mountain!” Xuan Bing’s cold voice responded.

“Master, I haven’t offended you, have I? I’ve always been helping you!” Luo Tian smiled awkwardly, approaching Xuan Bing and scrutinizing him closely.

“Did someone scare you?”

“This Shi Wang, such a bastard, is too damn cautious!” Xuan Bing thought bitterly. This Shi Wang was an ancient being passed down through ages, yet he was so timid.

The scene momentarily stalemated. Luo Tian lingered by Xuan Bing, while Shi Wang and his subordinates surrounded the icy mountain, refusing to leave.

“This isn’t a solution,” Luo Tian mused internally. He didn’t believe Xuan Bing was truly trapped in ice—what method had restrained him? Xuan Bing must be wary of something, hence his hesitation to attack. If he did strike, Xuan Bing would surely pay a price.

“Need these two to fight so I can escape!” Luo Tian thought, but after much deliberation, he could find no plan.

“Kid, you don’t need to descend. The temperature here is ten times lower than on the ground; eventually, you’ll be frozen to death!” Xuan Bing’s disdainful voice echoed, making Luo Tian shiver slightly.

Luo Tian felt the coldness deeply. That damned chill was once again invading him.

“Master, don’t force me!” Luo Tian gazed at Xuan Bing’s icy form and mentally transmitted.

“Kid, is it cold? Come down. Above will freeze you alive. It’s better to come down and become my subordinate!” Shi Wang also noticed this, though he suspected Luo Tian and Xuan Bing had no real connection. Yet Shi Wang was cautious by nature.

He had survived until now through the method of corpse transformation after being stabbed in the heart by an enemy. Shi Wang valued his life more now than before.

“Have the guts to come up, you little bastard! I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian shouted, trying to lure Shi Wang up so he could incite a fight between them.

“Master, if you don’t act soon, I’ll urinate on you!” Luo Tian shouted loudly, his gaze fixed on Xuan Bing. He knew people of Xuan Bing’s status cared deeply about their dignity.

“You dare! If you do that, I’ll cut off your tool!” Xuan Bing roared upon hearing Luo Tian’s words.

“Who’s afraid?” Luo Tian chuckled, unfastening his clothes and pretending to relieve himself. He had no choice.

“Now I’ll kill you!” Seeing Luo Tian actually undressing, Xuan Bing finally exploded. A storm of ice surged from his icy form, rushing toward Luo Tian.

Black ice shards transformed into blades, slicing through the void. Luo Tian’s face slightly changed, but his heart secretly rejoiced.

Alongside Luo Tian’s tension stood Shi Wang at the mountain base, observing the summit. Upon Xuan Bing’s attack, Shi Wang gripped his broken sword.

“Waiting for you to strike!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with madness. He wanted Xuan Bing to attack, even against himself.

“Swallowing Heaven!” Luo Tian opened his mouth, releasing an invisible vortex. Space twisted; the storm reached Luo Tian immediately but left him unharmed, as if absorbed by him.

But in a moment, Luo Tian spun around and spat toward Shi Wang’s direction.

Suddenly, another storm erupted. A destructive force surged from Luo Tian’s mouth. Luo Tian’s face paled, collapsing onto the ice surface, coughing up blood.

What seemed simple was actually perilous. Luo Tian had used “Swallowing Heaven,” temporarily absorbing Xuan Bing’s attack before expelling it. If he had been careless, he would have died.

“Impossible! This is the martial skill of Master Xingtian!” Xuan Bing’s eyes widened in disbelief. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to know Xingtian’s technique.

Thunderous sounds erupted as black ice storms swept down from the summit, sweeping across the icy mountain and instantly landing at Shi Wang’s feet.

All happened in a flash. Shi Wang hadn’t even seen Luo Tian absorb the technique.

“Xuan Bing, are you really going to attack me?” Shi Wang roared, his sword emitting radiant light. A towering blade slashed toward the storm radiating destruction.

Two powerful forces collided, shaking the heavens and earth. Cracks formed everywhere. The storm was severed by Shi Wang’s sword, but his face darkened.

“Want to kill me? What if you come up?” Luo Tian shouted, continuously cursing.

“Kid, I’ll kill you now!” Shi Wang roared, his broken sword radiating more power. This time, a hundred-foot blade slashed toward Luo Tian atop the mountain.

“Master, help me!” Luo Tian leaped into the air, standing behind Xuan Bing’s icy form to shield himself from the blade.

Crack… A thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. The massive blade struck Xuan Bing’s icy form, and even the tremors made Luo Tian’s blood churn.

Chapter 2553: Swallowing Heaven Reappears

Golden sword light shattered before Luo Tian, making his lips twitch. He could clearly feel the blade’s might.

Yet what startled Luo Tian was that Xuan Bing, who looked like an ice sculpture, had no injuries—only a single sword mark.

“Master truly is a world-shaking talent. Even this Shi Wang dares to challenge your dignity!” Luo Tian shouted.

“Your grandfather!” Xuan Bing cursed. He really didn’t want to fight.

“Xuan Bing, who did you call grandpa?” Shi Wang roared, slashing another blade that shattered on Xuan Bing’s body.

“Shi Wang, are you crazy? Do you want to die again?” Xuan Bing felt Shi Wang had gone mad, suddenly attacking him.

“You attacked me first!” Shi Wang replied. His blue eyes glowed with intense light.

“This Shi Wang is testing Xuan Bing!” Luo Tian thought joyfully. He knew Shi Wang wasn’t foolish; he wouldn’t attack Xuan Bing without reason.

He had just desperately transferred Xuan Bing’s attack to lure Shi Wang into striking. Now it seemed effective.

Buzz…

As Luo Tian was delighted, Shi Wang’s attack came again, striking Xuan Bing once more.

This time, Luo Tian could see a trickle of blood from Xuan Bing’s mouth and sense his anger.

“Shi Wang, don’t push me!” Xuan Bing now realized Shi Wang intended to kill him. As for why, he didn’t yet know.

“Yin Xuan Bing, do you really think I don’t know who you are? I never expected the legendary demon king to end up like this. I’ll turn you into my subordinate, and together we’ll break free from the Spirit and Ghost Marsh to conquer all!” Shi Wang roared, his blue eyes glowing with excitement.

The Spirit and Ghost Marsh was no ordinary place. Even Shi Wang, a formidable being, was bound by an invisible force, unable to leave. Otherwise, he would have already escaped.

“Damn!” Xuan Bing cursed internally. He knew some secrets—his own escape from the Spirit and Ghost Marsh was impossible. Though he wanted to leave, he didn’t want to do so as a zombie but rather by force.

Moreover, Xuan Bing had seals on him. Though he could temporarily break free from the seal, the cost was immense—possibly dying before the seal weakened completely.

Crack…

Golden sword light shattered again. Luo Tian’s lips twitched. He was beginning to doubt how he had survived before.

“Is this Shi Wang deliberately pushing me here?” Luo Tian thought of a bold guess.

“No matter what, if they fight, it’s beneficial for me!” He then shook his head, carefully observing the developments because it was about his life.

“Kid, have guts and come down!” Shi Wang shouted repeatedly, slashing blade after blade at Luo Tian—each strike landed on Xuan Bing.

“Kid, I’ll teach you my Dark Demon Sect’s secret technique. Let you briefly reach the late Xian Wang stage. Go kill him for me!” Xuan Bing finally couldn’t bear it anymore; if he didn’t retaliate, he would eventually be killed by Shi Wang.

“Master, just forget it. I can’t beat him!” Luo Tian frowned. He wasn’t unwilling to learn, but he was afraid. Neither Xuan Bing nor Shi Wang were good people; they might calculate him.

Crack, crack, crack…

Blades kept shattering on Xuan Bing’s body. The ice on his form cracked but quickly restored.

“Shi Wang, this is your fault!” Xuan Bing roared. His aura finally changed. The ice on his body began to crack with a sound.

Buzz…

Snow and ice swept the heavens, cold air bursting from Xuan Bing’s cracks. Snow and ice coalesced into a figure.

The figure was entirely black, made of ice and snow. Yet its aura was terrifying—identical to Xuan Bing.

Cold air swept the nine heavens and ten earths. The seated Xuan Bing closed his eyes. The black figure clenched its fists, its aura overwhelming, making Luo Tian feel immense pressure.

“Run…” Upon the black figure’s formation, Luo Tian immediately leaped off the icy mountain.

“Shi Wang, you’re doomed!” The cold voice echoed from the black ice figure. Its hands moved swiftly, snow and ice forming a massive seal that crushed toward Shi Wang.

“Only by using your body can you challenge me!” Shi Wang laughed, his sword radiating golden light. The broken sword collided with the seal.

Thunderous sounds erupted. Collisions echoed, violent waves spreading outward. Luo Tian stood a thousand feet away, without hesitation, fleeing toward the abandoned city.

“Catch him!” Shi Wang ordered his zombies. A late Xian Wang and four early Xian Wang zombies roared, chasing Luo Tian.

“You initially targeted me. Otherwise, this kid wouldn’t be alive now!” Xuan Bing spoke, gazing at Shi Wang.

“Correct. Your death was related to you, wasn’t it? If not for sealing you, I wouldn’t have been caught in the crossfire and stabbed through the heart by that guy!” Shi Wang laughed, gazing at Xuan Bing.

“Yin Xuan Bing, the former leader of the Dark Demon Sect, now reduced to this! Truly pitiful. And it’s me, a junior, who killed you!” Shi Wang laughed, charging toward Yin Xuan Bing with his sword.

Thunderous sounds erupted. Two former strongmen clashed, violent waves sweeping the surroundings. Even from afar, Luo Tian felt their fierce confrontation.

“Even if you have the Zhu Xian Sword, it’s just a broken blade. It can’t harm me. You sought death; I’ll grant it. Daring to challenge my authority, you’ve become overconfident. These years on this icy plain, I didn’t warn you, yet you dared to attack me!”

Xuan Bing continuously attacked, black ice forming various weapons that struck Shi Wang.

“Zhu Xian Sword!” Luo Tian ran, hearing Yin Xuan Bing’s words. His heart slightly trembled.

The top of the seven evil swords, Zhu Xian Sword!

Luo Tian never expected Yin Xuan Bing’s sword to have such a grand origin. He knew the sword was no ordinary one, but he hadn’t expected it to be a broken blade.

Luo Tian had heard of the seven evil swords and even possessed Longyuan, but he didn’t know where it had gone.

“How did this sword break?” Luo Tian was shocked. The top of the seven evil swords had been broken.

But now, Luo Tian didn’t care anymore. His body moved like lightning toward the abandoned city. Behind him, five zombies chased relentlessly.

“Shi Wang initially planned this—luring me to Yin Xuan Bing, then finding an excuse to attack him and test his strength. I was just a tool for him!”

“Thankfully, he wanted to use me; otherwise, I wouldn’t be alive now!”

“Four early Xian Wangs and one late Xian Wang—still a challenge, but it gave me a chance!”

“Using me? I’ll make him lose everything. No matter the outcome of your fight, these guys won’t return!” Luo Tian moved like lightning. Five zombies followed him closely, occasionally attacking.

Luo Tian wielded the blood knife, his body moving with agility. He no longer felt helpless; he occasionally retaliated and soon reached the abandoned city.

The black altar gradually appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, making his face break into a smile.

Luo Tian stopped. He gazed at the five zombies, and immediately, five attacks reached his front.

The blood knife slashed through the air. A crimson blade met the zombies’ attack, echoing with collision sounds.

“Roar…” The late Xian Wang zombie roared, then appeared before Luo Tian with a single step. Its icy claws aimed at Luo Tian.

“Get out of my way!” Luo Tian roared, unafraid. He punched, unleashing a flurry of attacks against the zombie’s claws.

One man and one zombie collided, both flying back. Luo Tian had several claw marks on his hand but didn’t dare to relax. He raised a hand, incanting the炼狱鬼爪 (Purgatory Ghost Claw), which descended from the sky to attack the remaining four early Xian Wang zombies.

Boom, boom, boom…

The four zombies had weaker intelligence than Shi Wang or the late Xian Wang zombie. They merely raised fists and claws against the Purgatory Ghost Claw.

The ghost claw shattered above the four zombies, creating a surge of energy that impacted the altar.

Buzz…

As Luo Tian’s collision with the zombies sent waves, the black altar emitted a strong suction force again.

“Here it comes!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up. He activated his technique, opening his mouth to suck in the force, twisting space around him and resisting it.

The five zombies were not so lucky. The powerful suction force pulled them into Luo Tian’s vision, disappearing.

However, the late Xian Wang zombie roared continuously, its body glowing with green light. It resisted the suction.

“Suction has weakened!” Luo Tian’s face paled, realizing this.

“Though it's in bad shape, an early Xian Wang zombie—should I still be able to handle it?” Luo Tian took out a pill and placed it in his mouth. These were items he had found in coffins before; now they helped him recover from injuries.

Luo Tian was in bad shape, but the zombie wasn’t much better. Its body had many cracks without blood oozing out, yet the wounds looked uncomfortable.

“Kill…” In an instant, one man and one zombie rushed toward each other. Luo Tian gripped the blood knife, slashing at the zombie.

Luo Tian wielded the blood knife, continuously slicing. The zombie, though with cracked flesh, was still formidable—especially its sharp claws, which didn’t fear Luo Tian’s blood knife.

Chapter 2554: Deepening the Journey

In the abandoned city, two figures clashed repeatedly. Thunderous sounds echoed as Luo Tian wielded his blood knife against the late Xian Wang zombie.

Luo Tian had suffered heavy injuries. Previously chased by Shi Wang, then transferring Xuan Bing’s attack with swallowing heaven, he had paid a heavy price. His internal organs felt as if they were twisted.

The late Xian Wang zombie was also in a bad state. The only advantage Luo Tian had was that this zombie, though powerful, lacked intelligence—perhaps Shi Wang feared its subordinates becoming too intelligent and rebelling.

“Even if this guy had intelligence, I might not be his match!” Luo Tian thought in awe. His blood knife clashed with the zombie’s fist, both bodies flying back. The zombie’s fist had a blade mark, and Luo Tian felt his blood churn.

“I don’t believe I can’t beat one corpse!” Luo Tian sheathed the blood knife, stepping into Huangquan Step (Yellow Spring Step), rushing toward the zombie.

Six轮回 (Reincarnations) and a flurry of attacks were combined by Luo Tian, emitting divine laws. His fists collided with the zombie.

Crack…

Thunderous sounds echoed everywhere. Two fists clashed, and Luo Tian felt he had struck an iron plate. His right arm lost sensation, and he kept stepping back.

“Roar…” Luo Tian stepped back but the zombie flew backward. The six whirlwinds on the zombie’s arm, combined with Luo Tian’s eightfold physical strength, were not easy to withstand.

Crash…

Flesh scattered. The zombie’s entire arm was torn apart by an invisible force, scattering on the ground. Yet no blood spilled.

“Fen Tian Li Huo Zhen (Blazing Heaven Fire Array)!” Luo Tian’s hands formed seals. A towering sea of fire surged, instantly surrounding him and the zombie.

The zombie saw the ten-color flames. Its hollow eyes showed a flicker of fear, purely instinctual.

“Indeed, it fears Xiaqi’s fire!” Luo Tian thought to himself. He gazed at the zombie and moved, his fists clenched again, rushing toward it.

“Roar…” The zombie wanted to flee but was sealed by the ten-color flames. It could only choose to fight Luo Tian again.

“Now, I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian laughed. His entire arm emitted black mist. As he swung, his arm was covered with a layer of black ice armor.

Crack…

In an instant, another collision sound echoed. Cracking sounds came from Luo Tian’s arm. That layer of ice armor shattered.

The zombie’s body flew back, and this time Luo Tian was right behind it. He flicked his finger, sending a black light toward the zombie.

“Roar…” The zombie roared loudly. This collision had hurt it significantly. As it opened its mouth, the black light entered it.

Crack, crack…

The black light entered the zombie’s mouth. In an instant, a cold aura spread out. Black mist surged, emitting extreme coldness on the zombie’s body, instantly freezing it.

“Burn!” Luo Tian extended his hand. A series of ten-color fire dragons wrapped the zombie.

“This is so satisfying!” Luo Tian watched the zombie, hearing the crackling sounds from it. The black light he had inserted was Jiu You Xuan Bing Shi (Nine-Yellow Ice Stone), an extremely cold object. Xiaqi’s fire was the hottest thing in the world. Luo Tian could imagine how the zombie must be suffering.

Crack…

In an instant, the zombie’s body shattered before Luo Tian. He extended his hand to retrieve the Jiu You Xuan Bing Shi.

“Is this name too evil?” Luo Tian panted, sitting cross-legged to recover his injuries. He knew Yin Xuan Bing and Shi Wang’s battle wouldn’t end so quickly.

“Who will win between these two old men?” Luo Tian thought, recovering his injuries while guessing their outcome.

“No matter who wins, I won’t return!” Luo Tian decided secretly. He felt both Shi Wang and Yin Xuan Bing were too terrifying.

Even from afar, Luo Tian could hear the thunderous sounds from the icy plain and even see the sky above it occasionally breaking.

Time passed slowly. Half a day later, Luo Tian’s injuries had recovered somewhat. At least, he looked fine on the surface.

“Where are Xingxuan and Qiuqiu now?” After that, Luo Tian thought of Fu Xingxuan. If Mota and others found Fu Xingxuan and Leng Qiuchan, it was fine. If they didn’t find them, would Fu Xingxuan be in danger?

Luo Tian began to worry about Fu Xingxuan, unaware that she had already left with Diaodezhu.

“This is just the outer area. How dangerous it is!”

“I’ll conceal my aura; they probably won’t find me,” Luo Tian still planned to try, seeing if he could pass through their battlefield and go deeper.

His vast spiritual awareness covered him. He concealed his form, flying toward the icy plain.

This time, Luo Tian’s speed was fast. After a day and a half of flying, he finally reached the edge of the icy plain. He took out the Jiu You Xuan Bing Shi, his aura becoming even weaker, matching that of the icy plain.

The icy plain was unusually calm, with only cold winds blowing. However, Luo Tian walked carefully, his heart tense. If it weren’t for Fu Xingxuan, he would never have returned.

Luo Tian could feel the wild fluctuations in the air. He didn’t dare to be careless, moving forward cautiously.

“Have they finished fighting?” Luo Tian wondered, gazing at the highest peak of the icy plain—the mountain where Yin Xuan Bing was. No one was fighting there.

Luo Tian walked carefully, quickly reaching a thousand feet away from Yin Xuan Bing’s position. His eyes narrowed slightly as he gazed at the battlefield.

At this moment, Yin Xuan Bing’s icy mountain was in disarray. Ice pits appeared on the ground. The ice body Yin Xuan Bing had formed was gone.

Yet, Yin Xuan Bing still sat on the mountain peak. His face was pale, and a large amount of blood had stained his icy form.

“He’s injured! Where is Shi Wang?” Luo Tian moved closer toward Yin Xuan Bing, then noticed Shi Wang’s presence.

Shi Wang’s tall figure lay beneath the icy mountain. The surroundings were in chaos, with his broken sword planted 100 feet away into the ground.

Shi Wang’s aura was extremely weak. His body was full of wounds, many sealed by ice and unable to heal.

“Both sides are injured?” Luo Tian’s heart stirred. At the same time, he felt their auras still confronting each other. True Xian Wang strength could not approach.

“That sword is Zhu Xian!” Luo Tian gazed at the broken sword, his mind conflicted. If he took a risk and obtained Zhu Xian, his strength would definitely increase significantly. Luo Tian couldn’t imagine how strong it would be to wield Zhu Xian and strike with one sword.

But the danger was great. Yin Xuan Bing and Shi Wang, though both injured, were not easy to handle. If he took Zhu Xian, they would surely know.

“Take a gamble!” After that, Luo Tian gritted his teeth. Both were in such states; he had a chance to escape.

After making the decision, Luo Tian carefully moved toward Zhu Xian Sword.

Luo Tian felt his heart jump out of his chest. His eyes were fixed on Shi Wang and Yin Xuan Bing, ready to flee at the slightest movement.

A hundred feet—Luo Tian walked for an hour as if he had traveled ten thousand miles.

“Here!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with excitement. He gritted his teeth and reached out to grab Zhu Xian Sword.

“Again, this kid!” At the moment Luo Tian moved, Shi Wang’s body emitted a terrifying aura. Yin Xuan Bing’s surprised voice also echoed; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to return.

“Two masters, excuse me. Farewell!” Luo Tian grabbed Zhu Xian Sword and fled toward the depths of the Spirit and Ghost Marsh.

“Kid, come back! He’s injured now. It's the perfect time to kill him!” Almost immediately after Luo Tian rushed out, both Shi Wang and Yin Xuan Bing shouted.

“No interest!” Luo Tian loudly replied. He moved through the icy plain, thinking that the farther he was from these two, the better.

“Kid, don’t you want the other half of Zhu Xian Sword?” However, Yin Xuan Bing’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him stop.

“The other half of Zhu Xian Sword?” Luo Tian was puzzled. He gazed at Shi Wang lying on the ground, seeing the broken sword tip in his chest and guessed it was the other half.

“Correct. That’s the other half, right there on Shi Wang. He is very weak now. If you activate Zhu Xian Sword, you can kill him!” Yin Xuan Bing shouted loudly, his voice filled with excitement.

“Friend, take the sword tip. I won’t resist!” Shi Wang quickly replied.

“Are these two trying to trick me?” Luo Tian thought internally. He had already experienced their abilities before.

“Yet, seeing Shi Wang’s condition, taking the sword tip should be fine. If it were possible, he would have attacked me already!” Luo Tian weighed the options.

“I can’t take more risks!” Another voice reminded him. His mind felt like two little people fighting—one wanted to go, the other didn’t.

“Don’t go. People shouldn’t be too greedy!” After that, Luo Tian made his decision and ignored Shi Wang and Yin Xuan Bing. He leaped into the air, fleeing toward the edge of the icy plain.

“Kid, think it over!” Seeing Luo Tian leave, both Yin Xuan Bing and Shi Wang became anxious.

“Wait. Let’s see who recovers first!” Yin Xuan Bing shouted loudly. Indeed, both had injuries but weren’t so weak that Luo Tian could kill them. However, both were wary of each other, allowing Luo Tian to take advantage.

Chapter 2555: Retreat

Luo Tian moved swiftly, quickly exiting the icy plain. However, a group of figures blocked his path—those zombies previously held back by cold air.

“I’ll give you a fatal blow!” Luo Tian glared at the horde, his eyes filled with anger. He moved swiftly toward them.

The horde was massive but weak in Luo Tian’s eyes—none were Xian Wang level. He moved like a tiger among sheep, his blood knife constantly falling to kill the zombies.

Each zombie was cut down by Luo Tian. Shi Wang’s face darkened, lying on the cold ground.

“Damn!” Shi Wang roared. These zombies were his subordinates, his assets. But now they were being cut down like vegetables by Luo Tian. He could feel it.

“I’ll kill you!” Shi Wang shouted, his aura rising. He regretted not killing Luo Tian earlier; otherwise, he wouldn’t have suffered such heavy losses.

Buzz…

As he spoke, Shi Wang finally unleashed his power. He raised his thick arm and grabbed the broken sword in his heart.

“Going crazy?” Yin Xuan Bing sat on the mountain peak, watching Shi Wang’s aura rise. Both had been injured in their previous battle but held back their final moves.

The broken sword was slowly pulled out, covered with rust. However, Shi Wang’s aura rapidly increased with each section removed.

Finally, under Yin Xuan Bing’s tense gaze, the broken sword was pulled out. It was covered with rust, looking as if it could be crushed by a single touch.

Shi Wang slowly stood up. His gaze met Yin Xuan Bing’s but he didn’t attack immediately. He also knew Yin Xuan Bing had hidden tricks.

Shi Wang stepped on the ground, his body moving like lightning toward Luo Tian. He vanished into the icy plain.

“This is your secret weapon? So you survived because of Zhu Xian Sword!” Yin Xuan Bing spoke softly, his voice cold.

“Damn thing. My life force is running out. I don’t know if I can survive the seal’s weakening!” Yin Xuan Bing muttered, thinking of the heavy losses in this battle.

“Shi Wang, I’ll definitely kill you!” Yin Xuan Bing’s cold voice echoed through the icy plain.

...

Ten... a hundred...

At this moment, Luo Tian was killing zombies. He had killed two or three hundred when he slashed one zombie in half. His heart suddenly trembled, and his skin prickled.

“Run!” This bad feeling appeared immediately. Luo Tian directly fled from the zombies, abandoning his massacre.

Luo Tian moved like lightning, quickly exiting the zombie horde and continuing toward the depths of the Spirit and Ghost Marsh. As soon as he left, Shi Wang appeared outside the horde, looking at the severed limbs and hands. Shi Wang’s already pale face became even more grim.

“Die!” Shi Wang leaped into the air, chasing after Luo Tian’s direction.

“Kid, you can’t escape!” Shi Wang quickly saw Luo Tian’s fleeing figure and shouted.

“You bastard! He’s injured, isn’t he!” Luo Tian cursed internally. He activated Huangquan Step to its maximum, his body turning into a blur. However, Shi Wang was getting closer.

“This time, if I’m caught, I’ll be killed!” Luo Tian felt anxious. He reached the black forest where Shi Wang and his zombies lived, seeing the coffins.

“Don’t be reckless; you won’t die!” Luo Tian thought at this moment. If he had just walked away, there wouldn’t be these problems.

Luo Tian didn’t think much. Shi Wang was only a few ten thousand feet away, and for Shi Wang, it was just a few seconds.

“Burn my blood!” Luo Tian made a decision instantly. Only by burning his blood could he increase his speed. This would only delay time, not escape.

Luo Tian had no choice but to flee desperately. This time, there was no one like Xuan Bing to protect him. He had to continue deep into the Spirit and Ghost Marsh.

Second drop... third drop...

Luo Tian kept burning his blood, keeping from being caught by Shi Wang. At this moment, he didn’t care about anything else but kept burning his blood.

Time passed. Luo Tian flew for seven days, burning four drops of blood. His body had become somewhat withered and exited Shi Wang’s forest.

The land became spacious again, and radiant light appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. This was the first time he had seen such light within the Spirit and Ghost Marsh, even in hell.

Luo Tian’s face was pale. The burning of his blood made him dizzy, and seeing the light, he instinctively rushed toward it.

“I’ll see how much blood you have to burn!” Seeing Luo Tian leaving his forest, Shi Wang frowned slightly.

He had stayed here for countless years. He had gone to the icy plain but never ventured deeper because he knew the more he went in, the more dangerous it was. Shi Wang was cautious by nature; his subordinates couldn’t leave the forest too far, so they couldn’t explore other areas.

“This light is annoying!” Shi Wang looked at the radiant light, which felt uncomfortable on him.

However, at this moment, Shi Wang had some confidence. After all, Luo Tian was leading the way. If there were dangers, it would be Luo Tian who faced them first.

Two streaks of light pierced the sky. One in front, one behind. Luo Tian’s eyes were blurred; he could barely hold on.

“Three drops of heart blood, if I burn them all, I’ll be dead!” Luo Tian’s eyes were blurred but his mind was somewhat clear.

“Check again. Maybe it’s my chance!”

“If this doesn’t work, I’ll have to fight desperately!” Luo Tian decided internally. This time he burned one drop of heart blood, maintaining his speed toward the place emitting divine light.

Time passed slowly. Two days later, Luo Tian finally saw what emitted the divine light—a massive statue.

“Someone!” After that, he felt there were buildings beneath the statue and even people walking inside.

“Last stand!” Luo Tian sighed. Although curious why there were people in the Spirit and Ghost Marsh, he didn’t want to lead Shi Wang there. If those people could kill Shi Wang, it was fine; if not, it would bring disaster to them.
