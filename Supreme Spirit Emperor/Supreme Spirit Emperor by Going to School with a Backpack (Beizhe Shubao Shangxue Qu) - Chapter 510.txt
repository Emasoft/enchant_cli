“Xiao Jie, you go too!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and Long Jie leapt into view.

“Another King Beast!” The crowd murmured, their eyes fixed on Long Jie and the three wolves, filled with awe.

“Kill them! Their worth far exceeds this great tomb!” The people showed no fear, their eyes burning with fervor.

“Kill them!” A battle cry erupted as the Yeming Eight Guardians surged forward toward the Bodhi Jewel. Luo Tian, however, stood before them, wielding a Zhenxian Brush in one hand and a Ription Spear in the other.

“We seek only the Bodhi Jewel; we need nothing else. Give us the jewel, and we’ll depart. Otherwise, there will be no mercy!” Guai Yi spoke solemnly. Eight green sickles whirled, slicing toward Luo Tian without leaving him a chance to evade.

“Indeed formidable!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination as he swung the Zhenxian Brush, sending five characters crashing down upon the Yeming Eight.

“Fighting to the death! We Yeming Guardians fear no such fate!” Guai Yi sneered, and the eight showed no hesitation. Their bodies radiated ironclad resolve as they continued to strike with their sickles.

“I fear no death!” Luo Tian’s gaze turned ruthless. He clutched the air with both hands, unleashing the Eight Directions Treasure Retrieval Technique, allowing the sickles to strike.

The Yeming Eight roared, spewing green mist from their mouths that coalesced into a vast sky, surging toward the five characters.

Boom after boom echoed through the heavens as the sky shattered, and the five characters pressed down upon them, forcing the eight to spit blood.

On another front, the eight sickles slashed at Luo Tian’s surroundings, barely missing his body. Blood spewed from Luo Tian’s mouth as he struggled to alter their trajectory, the effort draining him.

“Kill that fat man, and these people become mere dogs!” The remaining Heavenly Immortal Peak warrior lunged toward Sun Kenuan.

“You dare!” Luo Tian bellowed, drawing the Shaji Bow in his hand. He nocked an arrow, placing the Ription Spear against the bowstring. A resounding clash of weapons erupted as brilliant light flared.

“Puff…” The Ription Spear pierced the Heavenly Immortal Peak warrior’s chest, who had just reached Sun Kenuan.

At this critical moment, Luo Tian disregarded all else. Using the Shaji Bow might expose him, but if he eliminated these foes, no one would know.

“Annihilation!” The Yeming Eight roared, and the eight sickles embedded in the ground flew upward again, slicing toward Luo Tian.

“Make way!” Luo Tian bellowed, and the Zhenxian Brush expanded violently. He swung it furiously, clashing repeatedly with the eight sickles.

“Is he a Heavenly Immortal Peak?” The Yeming Eight gaped, stunned by Luo Tian’s mastery of the Zhenxian Brush, which repelled their sickles.

Each of them was among the elite in Heavenly Immortal Peak, and together they could crush any half-True Immortal or even True Immortal beginners. Though their current state was poor, they were far beyond ordinary Heavenly Immortal Peaks.

“Kill them!” The remaining people watched as the others began to absorb the Bodhi Jewel, their eyes blazing with fury. They charged toward Sun Kenuan.

“Whirr…” A black blade’s glow flickered, and Wan Gui Bao Hao roared as Gu Qianxue stood there, slicing with her Black Execution Blade.

“Puff… puff…” Blood splattered as two Heavenly Immortal Enders were severed into mist, halting the attackers.

“Kill them and repay my debt!” Gu Qianxue coldly declared, charging toward the remaining foes with her Black Execution Blade.

“Burst… burst…” Luo Tian kept retreating, the relentless battles leaving his face pale and wounded. The eight sickles attacked in waves without respite.

“I don’t believe you can endure without enough immortal energy!” Luo Tian muttered internally, his own advantage lay in the fact that those within the hall could not replenish their immortal energy, unlike himself.

Gu Qianxue swung her Black Execution Blade like a tiger among sheep, cutting down the foes with ease. Twenty or thirty were no match for her.

Chapter 1963: Collective Promotion ()

Within the hall, thunderous echoes resounded as Sun Kenuan, pale-faced, controlled his corpse against five True Immortal Beginnings.

The pristine Bodhi Jewel hovered there, with Diao Dezhu, Long Jie, and Chen Zhanbiao seated on the ground, absorbing its power.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue stood like fortresses, preventing anyone from approaching Sun Kenuan or Diao Dezhu.

Especially Gu Qianxue, her Black Execution Blade stained with blood, she resembled a demon from hell. Each strike claimed one or two lives, regardless of their rank—Heavenly Immortal End or Peak.

Luo Tian was locked in a grueling battle against the Yeming Eight, whose strength exceeded his expectations. He exhausted all his techniques but failed to subdue them.

Yet, as time passed, Luo Tian’s advantage gradually emerged. The Yeming Eight had few pills; after one trial, their immortal energy was depleted, relying solely on pills to endure.

The Yeming Eight marveled at Luo Tian’s might, employing all their techniques but never falling behind. This was partly due to their condition, yet Luo Tian was the strongest Heavenly Immortal below True Immortal they had encountered.

Time passed slowly, and eventually, the Yeming Eight could not endure. Luo Tian unleashed his Zhenxian Eight Techniques, pressing them to the ground with blood spewing. Though not killed outright, they could never rise again.

“Boom…” On another front, the corpse fought valiantly. The five True Immortal Beginnings could not replenish their energy, and when it was exhausted, they were torn apart by the corpse.

“Haha! Keep gloating!” Sun Kenuan spat blood, his body weakened as he laughed maniacally at the four remaining True Immortal Beginnings struggling to hold on.

“Boom…” The corpse fought valiantly, destroying everything with its might. Once True Immortal energy was spent, it attacked relentlessly under Sun Kenuan’s control.

Gu Qianxue had already ended her battle, wiping blood from her blade and standing coldly.

“Will you fight on?” Luo Tian panted, his body riddled with wounds as he gazed at the Yeming Eight who stood up, supporting each other despite their heavy injuries.

“Unless you hand over the Bodhi Jewel, we will not stop! Failure means death!” Guai Yi spoke with resolve.

“Death is the only outcome for Yeming Guardians!” The other seven echoed, their voices filled with pride.

Seeing their eyes and proud cries, Luo Tian was momentarily shaken, admiring their unyielding resolve.

“Boom…” A powerful echo rose behind Luo Tian as Diao Dezhu, Long Jie, and Chen Zhanbiao emitted strong auras.

“Promoted! All of them!” Luo Tian’s face lit up, sensing their auras and exhaling deeply.

“The Bodhi Jewel has been fully absorbed!” Guai Yi spoke, watching the jewel still hovering above them but devoid of its former divine laws.

“Everyone has reached Heavenly Immortal Peak! This Bodhi Jewel was truly terrifying!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief, sensing their power.

“If it had been fully absorbed by Diao Dezhu and the others, they might have reached half-True Immortal or even True Immortal Beginnings!” Gu Qianxue coldly remarked, her gaze filled with admiration. Had it not been for the cultivation method, she would have absorbed the Bodhi Jewel herself.

“Damn it, finally over! I couldn’t hold on any longer—cover for a while!” Sun Kenuan, seeing their promotion, collapsed like a pile of rags, his plump body drenched in sweat, pale as death.

“Boom…” Without Sun Kenuan’s control, the corpse collapsed with a thud onto the hall floor.

Though useless now, the corpse had achieved its purpose. The hall now held only two True Immortal Beginnings standing, their bodies torn and battered, gasping for breath as they gazed at the fallen corpse.

“Haha! Unexpectedly, we are the victors!” The two laughed wildly, their condition poor but still True Immortal Beginnings.

“Are you the one who killed our ancestor’s grandson?” The two True Immortal Beginnings addressed Luo Tian.

“You came too late! We already killed a True Immortal before you arrived!” A flash of violet light, Diao Dezhu appeared in front of one True Immortal Beginning, his claws gleaming as he lunged.

“Roar…” Long Jie and the three wolves howled, their massive bodies sweeping toward the two True Immortal Beginnings.

“Fat man, I’ll avenge you!” Sima Tuo moved like lightning, his green dagger in hand as he appeared before one True Immortal Beginning.

The two True Immortal Beginnings hadn’t caught their breath when Chen Zhanbiao and others surrounded them again, the thunderous clash echoing once more.

Luo Tian watched as they attacked the two True Immortal Beginnings without intervening, knowing they would not disappoint him. Though the two were strong, their current state was at its lowest; their True Immortal energy had been exhausted. Long Jie and the others could easily subdue them.

“The Bodhi Jewel is gone! Your mission failed; you’ll die anyway!” Luo Tian turned, addressing the Yeming Eight who supported each other.

“Follow me and pledge allegiance; I’ll protect you!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the Yeming Eight.

“Impossible! We Yeming Guardians are loyal to Zhongtian Commerce. Since our first mission at Heavenly Immortal Beginning, we’ve completed eight hundred and sixty-three tasks without failure. This is our first loss; you are truly strong, and I yield!” Guai Yi spoke, his eyes lifeless.

“Such talent wasted is a pity,” Luo Tian sighed deeply, feeling a flicker of compassion. Though he wished to recruit them, he knew it was unlikely.

“Who said your mission failed?” Luo Tian grabbed the Bodhi Jewel, now fully absorbed by Long Jie and others, and held it before the Yeming Eight.

“Take it! Though its power has been drained, this Bodhi Jewel is still a treasure. It should suffice for your mission!” Luo Tian shook his head, tossing several pills to the Yeming Eight.

“This…” Guai Yi took the Bodhi Jewel and pills, his cold eyes flickering with emotion. The other Yeming Guardians also wore complex expressions; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to return the jewel.

Though its power was gone, as Luo Tian said, it remained a treasure. They could return it to their superiors and avoid punishment since the mission was merely to retrieve the Bodhi Jewel.

“Thank you!” From Guai Yi to Guabei, they removed their masks, gratitude in their eyes as they bowed to Luo Tian.

“Call on us anytime! In Zhongtian Commerce, we still hold some status!” The eight spoke before reapplying their masks, swallowing Luo Tian’s pills to recover.

While Luo Tian conversed with the Yeming Eight, Long Jie’s golden dragon tail swept out, striking one True Immortal Beginning and sending it flying. Diao Dezhu bit through its neck, while Sima Tuo’s dagger pierced its heart.

“Gurgle…” The True Immortal Beginning fell, eyes filled with resentment as it crashed to the ground.

Chen Zhanbiao also seized another True Immortal Beginning, punching it in the back and sending it flying. It was torn apart by the three wolves.

“Finished!” Sima Tuo and Chen Zhanbiao panted, excitement in their eyes.

“Whirr…” Long Jie and the three wolves transformed into light, returning to the Nai Pan Dragon Seal and collar. Diao Dezhu stood on Luo Tian’s shoulder, his tiny feet perched there.

“Master Diao, you’ve annihilated two True Immortal Beginnings! Alas, geniuses are always invincible!” Diao Dezhu spoke loudly, his aura filled with loneliness as he crossed his arms.

“Damn it, you’ve shown off enough! Don’t leave me here; I can still show off! If it weren’t for me, could you have this strength?” Sun Kenuan’s weak voice echoed as he lay on the ground.

“Haha, grave robbers! You’ve truly made a name for yourself this time. I think you should carry this corpse forever; whoever dares touch you, just summon it and it’ll dominate the world!” Diao Dezhu and others laughed but helped Luo Tian lift Sun Kenuan.

“You don’t know a thing! Corpses in tombs cannot be taken out; it’s disrespectful to the dead and brings bad luck, affecting one’s fortune. We who walk this path value fortune most!” Sun Kenuan shook his head, grabbing the pill Luo Tian offered to recover.

“Go, put that corpse back and close the coffin!” Sun Kenuan ordered Sima Tuo. He then closed his eyes, no longer speaking; the effort of controlling a half-True Immortal corpse had drained him.

“Okay!” Sima Tuo, clearly experienced with Sun Kenuan, nodded and, along with Chen Zhanbiao, lifted the corpse toward the coffin.

Chapter 1964: Sha Long Is Not Dead ()

Not long after, Sun Kenuan’s face gradually regained color, though his aura remained weak. He stood up slowly, gazing at the coffin and bowing respectfully.

“Now it’s time to reap the rewards! I saw many burial items inside that coffin!” Sun Kenuan drooled, leaping onto the coffin without hesitation and diving into it.

Luo Tian and others smiled but did not rush to grab anything; even Diao Dezhu and Sima Tuo refrained. Without Sun Kenuan, they might have suffered casualties. They had absorbed the Bodhi Jewel and gained strength, while Sun Kenuan remained unchanged.

“Damn it, this True Immortal is poor…” After nearly an hour, Sun Kenuan’s face showed dissatisfaction as he jumped out of the coffin, but everyone saw his excitement.

“Cut it out! No one’s competing with you!” Diao Dezhu couldn’t help but mock him, then glanced around.

At that moment, the hall had no other life besides this coffin, Luo Tian’s group, and the Yeming Eight.

“Flame flickers!” Luo Tian directly set fire to the残肢断臂 on the ground, burning them clean and restoring the hall’s original state.

“But where is the exit?” The group soon faced difficulty; the hall had no other exits.

“Search! Fat man, you recover first!” Luo Tian addressed Sun Kenuan and the Yeming Eight. Now, the Yeming Eight were no match for them; Luo Tian could sense they only wanted the Bodhi Jewel.

“Let’s search! Find an exit!” Luo Tian then addressed Diao Dezhu and Sima Tuo.

“Okay!” The group nodded, scattering to search the hall’s corners for an exit and a lower level entrance.

Though the hall appeared large, after an hour of searching, they found no clues. They had even tried to break the hall with martial arts but failed completely.

“No!” The group returned, Sun Kenuan and the Yeming Eight having recovered. They stood there, eyes heavy with concern.

“We’ve searched the entire hall; no exit exists— even the entrance we came through is closed!” Diao Dezhu spoke, his voice anxious.

“Fat man, you often enter tombs; where is the exit?” Luo Tian addressed Sun Kenuan.

“You’ve all searched it! There’s one place left untouched: that coffin!” Sun Kenuan pondered, then pointed at the green ancient coffin beside them.

“Do you mean the exit is beneath that coffin?” The group turned their eyes to the massive ancient coffin.

“Not sure, but let’s try!” Sun Kenuan shrugged; it was the only place untouched.

“Push it!” Luo Tian stepped forward, pressing his hands against the coffin and straining with all his might.

“Boom… boom…” A deep rumble rose beneath their feet as Luo Tian pushed, a wave of heat rising from the ground.

“Open!” Luo Tian roared, and the massive ancient coffin lifted, revealing a gap beneath.

“Truly a gap!” Diao Dezhu shouted, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Boom…” A surge of energy erupted from the coffin’s original position, instantly pushing everyone back.

“Rustle… rustle…” A sound like waves echoed from the gap as the energy stabilized, and they returned to the exit.

But when they saw the scene below, their hearts trembled, and sweat poured from their faces.

An endless expanse of magma filled their vision, though distant, they had no doubt about its terrifying heat, capable of turning them to ash.

A red long sword hovered above the magma; within it lay a massive body, its yellow scales and enormous dragon head—longer than Long Jie’s by twice.

“Boom…”

Another boom echoed as the dragon head struck the magma, causing it to churn violently.

“That sword!” The group turned their eyes toward the red long sword, its overwhelming aura sending shivers through them. It felt like a sovereign of the world, surpassing even the previous half-True Immortal corpse.

“Whirr…” The red long sword emitted waves of crimson light.

“It’s my Fire Cloud Sword!” Long Que’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, startling him.

The sound of phoenix cries and dragon roars filled the air as Long Que emerged from the Beast Summoning Seal, gazing at the Fire Cloud Sword with excitement.

“Kid, run! That dragon isn’t dead; it wants to refine my Fire Cloud Sword!”

“Your battle’s fluctuations are beyond your comprehension! Once I kill this dragon, I’ll find you!” Long Que’s eyes darkened as he gazed at the dragon in the magma.

“You’re here!” As Long Que appeared, the dragon opened its eyes, fear in them.

Long Que’s power had once destroyed it completely, leaving a deep scar on Sha Long. If not for his feigned death and subsequent pursuit by others, he wouldn’t have survived to this day.

“It’s me!” Long Que boasted, spitting out a red lotus that pierced the void. The unbreakable hall was instantly burned away, revealing the sky.

“Run!” Long Que shouted, an invisible force acting on Luo Tian’s group, making their bodies vanish from the hall.

“Boom…” Like teleportation, they landed on sand, dazed.

“What is that bird?” Sima Tuo and the Yeming Eight, even Gu Qianxue, showed fear.

“Where are we?” But soon after, Luo Tian saw their surroundings and his face darkened; they had returned to the desert but didn’t know their location.

“Master Long Que, where did you drop us?” Diao Dezhu shouted, his voice echoing around, but only the sound of wind and sand replied.

“Boom… boom…” Not long after Diao Dezhu’s words, a series of booms rose beneath them.

They felt the ground tremble violently; before they could react, a dragon of fire appeared in their vision.

Ten miles away, like a volcanic eruption, molten rock surged skyward, piercing through the heavens.

“Damn it… Long Que’s help saved us!” The group felt relief, gazing at the molten rock that stretched through the sky. Around them was an empty void, distorting Luo Tian’s view.

As the terrifying molten rock erupted, the entire death desert became even hotter. Even at a distance, they were drenched in sweat.

“Haha! I didn’t expect you to be injured; this time, I won’t be so easy!” A bold voice echoed in their ears.

“But killing you is enough; to me, you’re still a pest!” A dignified voice responded, revealing it was Long Que’s.

The collision sounds from the molten rock continued, each strike turning the world upside down, sending terrifying waves outward.

“Whirr…” A violent wind surged from the direction of the molten rock, lifting a vast amount of sand.

“Wail…” The world darkened as the wind gathered, eventually forming a terrifying tornado that swept outward.

“Thousand feet… ten thousand feet…”

“Damn it, run! It’s a sandstorm!”

“Their battle affected the weather of the death desert!” Sun Kenuan shouted, making Luo Tian’s group change expressions. Without hesitation, they ran toward the distance.

Though their speed was fast, the sandstorm’s speed was faster, its terrifying waves sweeping toward them like a giant mouth ready to swallow.

“Done…” Not long after, the already black sandstorm spread over Luo Tian’s group.

“Boom…” No chance was given; it instantly devoured them, their figures immediately lifted and carried away. No matter how they resisted, it was futile.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian roared, and in an instant, he felt no trace of his group. His immortal energy surged wildly within his dantian to resist the terrifying sandstorm.

Dizziness constantly invaded Luo Tian’s body, but he gritted his teeth, maintaining the last of his clarity.

“Truly a disaster!” Luo Tian muttered internally; he didn’t know where the storm would carry him. At the same time, his heart was filled with worry for others.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian didn’t know how long it had been, his body covered in blood, his immortal energy completely drained. The sandstorm began to tear at his flesh.

Extreme pain made Luo Tian, on the verge of unconsciousness, regain clarity. The sandstorm prevented him from opening his eyes; his spiritual sense was also destroyed. He could only close his eyes, letting the storm carry him. If it lasted too long, his flesh would not withstand and be ground to dust in the terrifying sandstorm.

“Boom…” After an unknown time, Luo Tian’s body fell heavily to the ground, the impact knocking him out completely.

In the vast desert, Luo Tian lay there with his eyes closed, the scorching sun burning the golden sands, turning his body a deep red.

Chapter 1965: I Cannot Let You Die ()

The scorching sun blazed, and Luo Tian lay with his eyes closed on the desert. His lips were cracked, his clothes torn by the sandstorm, and his body covered in wounds that had scabbed.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, gazing at the sun high above.

“Sigh…!” Intense pain made Luo Tian grimace, but it only split his lips, blood spilling over them. However, the blood’s moisture made him feel slightly better.

“Such severe injuries! I wonder how they are doing!” Luo Tian slowly stood up, realizing his condition was dire.

His body was riddled with wounds; the worst was that his dantian’s immortal energy had been completely drained. He discovered this place had no immortal energy, meaning he couldn’t recover.

Though his body was strong, it still needed immortal energy to heal quickly. Without it, he could recover but at a much slower pace.

And without immortal energy, Luo Tian couldn’t open his storage ring to retrieve the pills inside. If he encountered danger in this death desert, his life would be at risk.

“Stay calm! Things aren’t that bad yet!” Luo Tian muttered internally, though his injuries were severe. He first forced himself to stay calm and looked at the endless desert without rushing around.

“Where is Master Long Que? He said he could only fight for a minute, but now the time has clearly exceeded!” Luo Tian quickly thought of Long Que. With his strength, escaping the death desert would be much easier.

“Wait one night; tomorrow morning, follow the sun’s direction!” Luo Tian suddenly thought of Ran Hao. Previously in Shaihai King City, Ran Hao had told him many survival tips for the desert. If lost, one should stay overnight if possible and then estimate time by the sunrise in the east.

“If Ran Hao were here, he would be much better than me. I hope he is safe!” Luo Tian sighed softly and then lay on the scorching desert, recovering his strength.

At this moment, Luo Tian was only slightly stronger than an ordinary person. The desert’s night made him uncomfortable; he endured one night, and when the sun rose, it instantly baked the desert. The cold and heat made Luo Tian feel extremely uncomfortable, shivering as he stood up and walked toward the sunrise.

One night had passed; Luo Tian’s injuries showed no signs of improvement. He struggled through the desert with difficulty.

After walking half a day, it was still endless yellow sand. Luo Tian’s body was weak, his physical condition deteriorated further; he panted heavily, his face pale as a sheet.

“A plant!” Wobbling, Luo Tian finally found one. He recognized it as “Invincible Grass,” a plant Ran Hao had introduced to him, the only one that could survive in the death desert.

Invincible Grass was edible, and its roots had water—though only a little—but for Luo Tian at this moment, it was like snow in the desert.

Golden leaves; if not carefully observed, one would miss its presence. This was Invincible Grass’s camouflage.

Luo Tian quickly moved his hands, carefully digging into the ground and finding moist soil. A pool of water appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. He didn’t care, directly scooping up the mud and drinking it.

After drinking the mud, he also placed the Invincible Grass in his mouth, chewing it fiercely. A bitter taste instantly filled his mouth; though bitter, for Luo Tian at this moment, it was like a delicacy.

After eating one Invincible Grass, Luo Tian felt slightly better and continued heading east. After walking half a day, his blurred vision saw waves of black mist appearing in front of him.

Upon seeing the black mist, Luo Tian immediately thought there was danger and wanted to avoid it. However, he hesitated; if there were opportunities, it would be a chance for life.

After careful consideration, Luo Tian decided to gamble and walked toward the black mist. After less than a quarter of an hour, he saw what the black mist was—black sword, lying on the desert. Black mist continuously emitted from the long blade; its hilt had a terrifying ghost head, making people shiver. It was Gu Qianxue’s Black Execution Blade.

Luo Tian took three steps and ran to the blade but found no sign of Gu Qianxue. This made Luo Tian feel a layer of gloom.

“This blade is crucial to Qianxue; she must be nearby!” Luo Tian muttered internally but didn’t pick up the blade. With his current condition, he couldn’t even lift it.

Luo Tian began searching for Gu Qianxue near the blade, convinced she was nearby.

“Don’t let her die!” Luo Tian constantly prayed in his heart, not missing any place. Finally, he found Gu Qianxue behind a sand dune.

At this moment, Gu Qianxue was also in a pitiful state; her clothes were gone, and she lay there with blood covering her body. Her face was pale, eyes closed, breathing weakly.

“Qianxue!” Luo Tian rushed to her side, his eyes filled with pain. At this moment, Gu Qianxue was even worse than before; she had fallen into unconsciousness.

Luo Tian could clearly feel her life force fading, on the brink of death.

“Qianxue, wake up!” Luo Tian shook Gu Qianxue. If he were in good condition, sweat would have flowed down his back, but now he was so dehydrated he couldn’t even produce sweat.

“What to do? What to do!” Luo Tian felt panic for the first time, like a ant on a hot pan. At this moment, he had no solution; both were naked and had no external items.

“I won’t let you die, Qianxue! I definitely won’t let you die. No water, but I still have blood!” Luo Tian quickly thought of a solution.

“Right! My blood, I had fused with the Immortal Herb before; my blood must be able to save her!” Luo Tian shouted internally, lifting Gu Qianxue and approaching the Black Execution Blade.

“Puff…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, slicing his wrist against the blade. Blood immediately flowed from his wrist.

One drop… two drops… each drop of blood flowed into Gu Qianxue’s withered lips. Gu Qianxue instinctively began to suck Luo Tian’s blood.

Luo Tian’s face, however, grew even paler; the loss of blood made him weaker. It also took away his life force.

Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with a gentle smile, gazing at Gu Qianxue as she sucked his blood.

Finally, Gu Qianxue’s face gradually turned red, but her body was still hot and showed no signs of waking.

“I must take you out!” Luo Tian’s face was pale, his skin dry and sunken. He staggered to his feet, carrying Gu Qianxue without caring about the Black Execution Blade and walking through the desert.

Weakness, Luo Tian knew he was extremely weak now. From Jiuyu to the Immortal Realm, he had never felt so weak before, even weaker than when he was exiled from Feiyun Sect.

But Luo Tian knew he couldn’t fall; if he did, both he and Gu Qianxue would die in this death desert.

“Qianxue, why don’t you recognize me?”

“Do you remember when we first met on the Five Elements Sect’s recruitment ladder? It’s been thousands of years since then, and our child is already so big!”

“We’ve braved countless storms and waves. A small death desert won’t stop me! I’ll take you out, even if my blood runs dry!” Luo Tian kept speaking, recounting their past.

Every time Gu Qianxue’s life force faded, Luo Tian would tear his wrist wound again and feed her blood to sustain her.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian carried Gu Qianxue for three days, his eyes blurred and seeing stars. He had to rest after every few steps.

Along the way, Luo Tian found only two Invincible Grasses but didn’t eat them himself, chewing them all to feed Gu Qianxue. He also gave her water.

“Someone!” On the fourth day, Luo Tian finally found a figure buried under sand, only half their body visible.

Luo Tian carried Gu Qianxue to the figure’s side, his eyes filled with joy. This person was clearly dead; their chest had a spear through it, and a package was on their back.

“Good thing it’s not Zhanbiao!” Luo Tian sighed in relief, untying the package. A water flask fell into his hands; it still had half a flask of water.

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, directly feeding the water to Gu Qianxue. Then he dug out the person from the sand, took off their clothes, and dressed Gu Qianxue in them.

“Commoner; no pills at all!” Luo Tian then checked the package again but found nothing. Besides some ropes and survival items, there were no other things.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed, then sat down on the ground, his weakness spreading through his body.

“I can’t hold on anymore!” Luo Tian swayed, approached Gu Qianxue, and used the knife from the package to cut his wrist. He wrote three characters on the package.
