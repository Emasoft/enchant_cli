“Brother, if you don’t leave, I won’t either!” While playing with the black ape who had also transformed into a burly man, Long Bao heard Luo Tian’s words. His small face displayed a reluctant expression and he approached Luo Tian.

Black Tiger furrowed his brows slightly. He and the black ape had been ordered by Long Jian to bring Luo Tian back before they emerged. Now that Luo Tian refused to leave with him, he felt at a loss.

“Kid, just go! Why so many words!” The black ape heard Luo Tian’s words and transformed into a broad-shouldered man, grumbling as he pounded his chest and approached Luo Tian with a fierce glare.

Seeing the black ape coming, Luo Tian couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He had visited Da’an Forest two or three times before, and was somewhat familiar with these fierce beasts. Among them, the most troublesome was this black ape.

After several encounters, Luo Tian knew that this black ape was the most difficult to please, a man of single-mindedness who only obeyed Long Jian. To him, Long Jian’s words were more effective than imperial edicts.

“Ah… Elder, could you be a bit lenient?” Luo Tian approached the black ape with a fawning smile and spoke in a conciliatory tone.

“Impossible!” The black ape’s eyes widened, adopting an attitude as if he would seize Luo Tian if he didn’t leave.

The Four City Guardians and the people of the Three Major Families watched Luo Tian’s group conversation with trembling hearts, not daring to breathe a word. Though Black Tiger and the black ape had transformed into human forms, people hadn’t forgotten the blood emperor who had nearly killed them all earlier. Now it was just a ball, held in Tang Wutong’s arms.

“Ah… Elder, since Luo Tian doesn’t want to leave, perhaps we wait for him to finish his business and then go together. How about that?” Zhang Ziping, seeing Luo Tian’s desperate gaze, spoke up to advise.

Zhang Ziping had become somewhat familiar with these two black elders during the journey, and they had won over the two fierce beasts. Now Zhang Ziping’s words made Black Tiger and the black ape hesitate, especially Black Tiger who had praised Zhang Ziping throughout the journey.

As they pondered, a terrifying fluctuation arose in their minds, causing them to immediately revert to beast forms. Their gazes turned solemn as they looked toward the distance.

Meanwhile, an old man from Yuling Sect, who had been glowing with eyes and searching the ground for undamaged storage bags of dead practitioners from the Cultivation Body and Bone-Transformation stages, suddenly halted his actions. His aura condensed sharply.

Others looked on in confusion at the transformation of one person and two beasts, wondering why these three mighty figures showed such caution.

Luo Tian was closest to them and naturally felt their unease. He extended his spiritual sense outward.

Subsequently, Luo Tian’s gaze grew more puzzled. His spiritual sense revealed a woman in white robes as pure as snow and a middle-aged man with golden and blue wings, both smiling as they flew toward him from afar.

But what stunned Luo Tian was that he sensed no spiritual energy from the woman, as if she were an ordinary person. Meanwhile, the middle-aged man’s cultivation was at the peak of the Soul-Formation stage.

Luo Tian's curiosity wasn’t about the soul-forming middle-aged man but rather the woman who seemed ordinary. This situation made Luo Tian take it seriously; it was too strange for an ordinary person to fly in the sky. How could he not be puzzled?

It wasn’t just Luo Tian who noticed something amiss; all the Soul-Formation stage masters on site had also sensed the two people approaching them, their faces showing surprise.

Black Tiger and his brother instinctively shielded Tang Wutong and Luo Tian behind them, while the Yuling Sect elder protected Leng Qiuchan. Their gazes carried a hint of fear as they looked at the couple approaching like meteors.

Chapter 465: Parents ()

Chapter 465: Parents

It seemed they sensed someone using spiritual sense to detect them, especially when Luo Tian’s spiritual sense scanned the couple. The woman's face showed a touch of excitement.

“Hurry! It’s all your fault, dragging your feet! Why don’t you channel more spiritual energy? At the peak of Soul-Formation, your speed is so slow. If it weren’t for you wasting so much time, I would have seen my son already. Look at my hair—does it look messy?” The woman grabbed the middle-aged man’s hand, her face showing anxiety as she kept urging him.

Seeing his wife after years of companionship, the middle-aged man wore a bitter smile. He had rushed as fast as he could to catch up with her, but his spiritual body was only at the peak of Soul-Formation. He had nearly died several times in the Northern Sea, and just now after reuniting with her, she had pulled him to the Eastern Domain.

“Alright, alright. It’s fine. You’re his mother; he won’t mind.” The middle-aged man helplessly comforted her.

As they spoke, they reached Luo Tian’s group above and landed before him with expressions of excitement. Black Tiger and his brother hadn’t noticed anything.

But as the two landed before Luo Tian, time within a hundred-mile radius seemed to freeze; everyone stopped moving.

Black Tiger and his brother, along with the Yuling Sect elder, showed shock on their faces but couldn’t move. Others of Soul-Formation and below remained in their previous expressions and actions, rigidly still.

Luo Tian noticed the people’s abnormality but found himself unaffected. His gaze was blank as he looked at the middle-aged couple.

The couple, however, gazed at Luo Tian with excitement, momentarily forgetting to speak. Tears welled in their eyes.

“Elders, who are you?” Luo Tian felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity the moment he sensed the couple with his spiritual sense. As they approached, this feeling grew stronger.

Hearing Luo Tian’s question, the couple finally regained their senses. The woman gently wiped her face and said, “Child, I am your mother; this is your father!”

“Boom…” Upon hearing the woman’s words, Luo Tian’s head suddenly went blank as if exploded. His face showed disbelief, his eyes wide open, staring at the couple.

“Say it again!” Luo Tian’s eyes instantly turned red; his voice trembled, as if squeezed from his throat.

“It is true. I am your father; she is your mother!” The middle-aged man’s face showed a touch of emotion, his gaze softening toward Luo Tian.

“I don’t believe it!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, his eyes showing disbelief. Yet the blood power within his body couldn’t lie.

Luo Tian stared at them, as if time itself had frozen around him. His gaze gradually shifted from excitement to calmness, a resentment slowly gathering in his heart.

“Did you come looking for me?” Luo Tian’s voice was calm, as if he hadn’t seen them at all.

Seeing Luo Tian’s gradually cold expression, the middle-aged man showed understanding, while the woman turned pale, her gaze filled with disbelief as she looked at Luo Tian.

“If there’s nothing else, please release my friends!” Seeing the woman turn pale, Luo Tian felt a strange pain in his heart but didn’t show it. His voice remained completely unshaken.

“Stupid kid, are you…”

“Child, I am your mother!” The middle-aged man was about to speak when the woman rushed toward Luo Tian, hugging him tightly and crying.

Warmth—Luo Tian’s first feeling was warmth, like the hands in his dream. For a moment, he couldn’t let go of this embrace.

“Sorry, I’m an orphan!” Luo Tian forcibly suppressed his strong longing and gently pushed the woman away.

“Stupid kid! She’s your mother! You…”

“Shut up!” Luo Tian roared, his eyes instantly turning blood-red, a mad expression on his face.

“Parents!” Luo Tian shouted loudly.

“I only know I’m an orphan, without father or mother! My father was Chen Dazhuang, and he’s dead!” Luo Tian raged, shouting.

“Who said you were my parents?”

“Hmph… Who abandoned me as a child? Where were you when I was bullied? Where were you when my cultivation was destroyed, and I was expelled from the sect and fell into the Wàng Yōu Pool? Where were you when I faced death multiple times, nearly losing my life?” Luo Tian’s eyes turned red, his face showing pain as he shouted.

“Spit…!” The woman’s face turned even paler, and she spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Child, let me explain…” The middle-aged man quickly stepped in front of the woman, wiping her blood from her lips.

As the woman spat out this mouthful of blood, the world within a hundred miles seemed to change abruptly. A sorrowful emotion spread throughout the land. Black Tiger and his brother, along with the Yuling Sect elder, regained their movement but didn’t act rashly. They felt no killing intent from the woman and carried fear in their eyes, having heard the subtle relationship between this couple and Luo Tian.

“Silence… I don’t need explanations! I only believe in facts!” At this moment, Luo Tian seemed to have forgotten his cultivation and the woman’s power to end his life with a single breath. He looked helplessly at the middle-aged couple, like an injured child.

“Good! Good! Good!” The woman, seeing Luo Tian’s madness, showed a look of pain.

“You’ve gone too far! You little bastard! Do you know what we sacrificed for you?” The middle-aged man’s face showed a touch of anger, shouting at him.

The woman extended her hand, forming a displacement force across the ground. In an instant, Black Tiger and his brother, along with Leng Qiuchan, vanished from the original spot and appeared in Beiming City.

On the battlefield, only Luo Tian and the couple remained, staring at each other.

“Tian’er! I must give you an explanation; if you know the truth, then even if you don’t recognize me, I’ll have no words!” The woman’s face showed a touch of ferocity as she bit her finger, drawing blood that floated before her.

At the moment the woman’s blood appeared, a powerful aura radiated from it, overwhelming Luo Tian with immense pressure.

Luo Tian could feel that this single drop of blood contained the will to destroy him.

“Yue’er, you must! It’s too dangerous for you!” The middle-aged man’s voice carried urgency as he shouted at the woman.

“I’ve made up my mind!” The woman’s face showed determination, and with a single finger, the blood spread out, merging into Luo Tian’s body.

Chapter 466: Awakening the Cycle ()

Chapter 466: Awakening the Cycle

At the moment the woman’s blood attached to Luo Tian, he was instantly enveloped by drowsiness. His eyelids began to flutter; although his willpower was strong, his eyes wouldn’t obey and eventually closed.

“With my blood, awaken the cycle!” The woman’s eyes showed determination as she spat another mouthful of blood, forming endless seals that wrapped around Luo Tian.

After finishing her shout, the woman’s face turned even paler, and she seemed to have lost all strength. If it weren’t for the middle-aged man supporting her, she would have collapsed.

“Yue’er, why do you suffer so!” The middle-aged man’s face showed pain as he gently combed the woman’s disheveled long hair.

“Only in this way can Tian’er recognize me, and allow him to have no barriers in his heart in the future!” The woman’s voice was resolute, without a trace of regret.

Luo Tian closed his eyes but felt as if he were dreaming, his soul slowly drifting out of his body and being sucked into a black hole. No matter how he resisted, he couldn’t withstand it.

Luo Tian felt his soul being absorbed into a black hole,穿梭 through the void.

After flying for an unknown time, suddenly a light appeared before Luo Tian, pushing him with powerful repulsion.

“Ha…!” A loud and cheerful voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, bringing him back to clarity.

Where was this? Luo Tian felt puzzled but saw an old man holding a baby in his arms, laughing joyfully. A young couple stood before the old man, also smiling.

Upon seeing the old man and the young couple, Luo Tian was stunned; these were none other than the middle-aged couple who had called themselves his parents.

At this moment, Luo Tian also realized he existed in another form of this world, only able to witness events without physical sensations.

“I have finally gained a grandson, and it’s a Five Elements Body! Hmph, I’ll see what the old bastards in the family have to say!” The old man’s face showed joy, his gaze filled with endless pride.

Luo Xiong, the island master of Bīngjí Island in Tianyuan Continent, was powerful and had reached the initial stage of Soul-Formation. His son, Luo Nantian, was gifted and had become a Soul-Formation master at twenty-eight.

Bīngjí Island was different from other sects that recruited various talents; it functioned like a family in the secular world, with all members bearing the Luo surname and only distinguishing between main and branch lines.

“Tian’er, should we change the name? You’re named Luo Nantian, but your son is named Luo Tian. Look at it!” Zhang Qiu Yue smiled.

“Fine, the name Luo Tian is good. I named Nantian Luo Nantian because I hoped he would dominate the Southern Domain, but my grandson must dominate the entire world. He will walk the path of stepping on heaven. This name is good!” Luo Xiong smiled and confirmed Luo Tian’s name.

As time passed, Luo Tian gradually understood the background of this old man and young couple. When he saw the baby, he felt an inexplicable sensation and sighed inwardly: “Is this me as a child?”

Luo Tian only sighed once before continuing to watch the scene. He also wanted to know why he had been abandoned.

As Bīngjí Island was one of the major sects in the Southern Domain, having a grandson was no small matter. Especially since it was a rare Five Elements Body, so many people came to congratulate him. It was clear how much attention Luo Tian received.

More importantly, several old masters who had been in seclusion at Bīngjí Island emerged from their retreats and announced they would jointly take Luo Tian as a disciple after he turned seven.

At that time, the Luo family’s main line was at its peak in Bīngjí Island, with absolute authority.

Although the various lines of the Luo family had some conflicts, they were surprisingly unified on this matter. A Five Elements Body would surely elevate the Luo family and Bīngjí Island to a higher level. Everyone in the Luo family regarded Luo Tian as their treasure, cherishing him in their hands.

Luo Tian watched his childhood self with deep emotion and gradually saw himself grow up, feeling as if he had returned to his childhood.

As Luo Tian watched himself grow, he eventually reached three years old. In these three years, he lived happily and carefree.

However, everything changed dramatically in the year Luo Tian turned three.

That day, Luo Xiong discovered a golden book while exploring an ancient site and brought it home. Although he felt the golden book was extraordinary, after studying it for a few days, he found no way to open it and eventually left it in the study.

“Ji Yuan Book!” As Luo Tian watched the scene, he was stunned upon seeing the golden book in Luo Xiong’s hand. How could he not recognize this book that had changed his life?

At three years old, Luo Tian could already run around the courtyard. As a Five Elements Body, he was faster than most ordinary maids.

Luo Tian ran into Luo Xiong’s study and found the golden book he had brought back. He played with it, turning it over.

But no one expected that the golden book would cut Luo Tian’s tiny hand, drawing blood from it. The blood dripped onto the golden book.

After absorbing Luo Tian’s blood, the Ji Yuan Book radiated a brilliant gold light. A powerful fluctuation spread throughout Bīngjí Island.

The golden light enveloped Luo Tian, like a golden cocoon that blocked the view from outside.

After this powerful aura spread, Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian immediately felt the change in the study. They appeared instantly in the study, seeing Luo Tian wrapped in golden light.

Luo Tian’s mother, Zhang Qiu Yue, worried about her son's safety and rushed toward the golden light but was blocked by it. Even Luo Xiong, a Soul-Formation master, was repelled.

At that moment, the entire Luo family was tense; Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian were guarding the study, waiting for the golden light to fade.

Seven days passed slowly. Under Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian’s expectant gaze, the golden light finally disappeared, revealing a sleeping Luo Tian.

As the golden light faded, Luo Xiong approached Luo Tian and picked him up. He probed with his spiritual sense but found no changes in Luo Tian’s body, confirming he was just sleeping. He sighed slightly.

Luo Nantian showed concern on his face, took Luo Tian from him, and checked again but found no abnormalities. Then he handed Luo Tian to Zhang Qiu Yue.

But they soon noticed that the golden book Luo Xiong had brought back was missing, casting a shadow over their hearts.

Chapter 467: Yin Tianxiong ()

Chapter 467: Yin Tianxiong

Luo Tian watched this and felt a sense of regret. He could clearly feel that Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue truly loved their child, and he regretted his earlier treatment of the couple.

In the scene, after the incident with the golden book, little Luo Tian was protected by Zhang Qiu Yue and Luo Nantian. They constantly frowned, worried about any changes in little Luo Tian.

Time passed another year; Luo Tian was four years old, but it was strange that he showed no signs of growth. Children usually change every day, but since that day, little Luo Tian remained at three years old without any changes.

This situation made Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian feel uneasy, sensing a bad premonition.

In this anxious state, little Luo Tian grew another year but still showed no signs of growing taller or maturing. His intelligence remained at three years old, which made Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian completely lose their composure. They began to seek medical help constantly.

All the famous alchemists in the Southern Domain were sought by Luo Xiong, but none could find an answer. This strange event even spread throughout the Southern Domain. However, it was comforting that little Luo Tian remained a Five Elements Body with no changes.

As time passed, Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian spent another two years searching for a cure for little Luo Tian, but they still had no clues. Little Luo Tian was seven years old by then.

At the time of little Luo Tian’s seventh birthday, a sudden change occurred on a moonlit night. Little Luo Tian suddenly started crying uncontrollably, and no one could calm him down.

Zhang Qiu Yue had no choice but to hold little Luo Tian in her arms, constantly comforting him. However, it was useless, and Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian were anxious.

They didn’t notice that the moon had turned an eerie red, and little Luo Tian’s crying made them ignore the entire sky turning red.

But as Luo Tian watched events unfold in another form, he knew it was because the Ji Yuan Book in little Luo Tian’s mind was constantly agitated. It seemed to be pulled out of his body.

Finally, the Ji Yuan Book broke free from some restraint and flew out of little Luo Tian’s body.

The Ji Yuan Book was so fast that even Luo Xiong, at the initial stage of Soul-Formation, couldn’t react in time. When he realized it, the Ji Yuan Book had already disappeared into unknown places.

Little Luo Tian rapidly weakened after the Ji Yuan Book left, his life force gradually fading away.

Luo Xiong was no doubt a Soul-Formation master and the island master of Bīngjí Island. His long years as a leader had made him calm and composed in the face of crises. Seeing little Luo Tian’s life force fading, he showed a touch of cruelty and immediately burned his Soul-Formation cultivation to pour concentrated life force into Luo Tian’s body.

His cultivation dropped, but with his efforts, little Luo Tian’s life force was restored. However, the price he paid was falling from the initial stage of Soul-Formation to the peak of Soul-Formation.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue felt their hearts break, watching their father’s cultivation drop and their son recover. They felt helpless.

“Mother, hold me!” Little Luo Tian, upon waking up, showed a childish expression and climbed into Zhang Qiu Yue’s arms to fall asleep.

As Zhang Qiu Yue picked up little Luo Tian, her face suddenly turned pale, and she spoke with a trembling voice: “Father, Tian’er’s body type is gone!”

“What?” Upon hearing Zhang Qiu Yue’s words, Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian’s faces suddenly turned pale. They checked again but found that little Luo Tian was no longer a Five Elements Body and had lost all attributes.

“Cough…!” Luo Xiong’s face turned pale, and the drop in his cultivation combined with Luo Tian’s loss of body type made this old man seem to have aged decades.

“It’s my fault; it’s all because I brought that cursed book back! If I hadn’t, this wouldn’t have happened!” Luo Xiong began to strongly blame himself, repeatedly hitting his chest.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue quickly stopped Luo Xiong, their faces showing determination: “Father, it’s fate. Believe that Tian’er won’t blame you when he grows up!”

“Even without attributes and talent, he is my Luo Nantian’s son. If he becomes renowned across the continent, I will be proud of him. If he is a failure, even if he’s spoiled, I’ll protect him for life and ensure his safety. It won’t be a waste of our father-son bond!” Luo Nantian spoke, his words short but resolute, as if making a promise to the young Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt his heart shake upon hearing Luo Nantian’s words, and his resentment vanished. A strong sense of regret spread in his heart. Luo Nantian’s words were like a beam of sunlight, dispelling the resentment in his heart.

Although Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian wanted to keep the matter under wraps, paper couldn’t cover fire. After the Ji Yuan Book left his body, Luo Tian gradually grew and no longer remained at three years old.

The news that Luo Tian had lost his Five Elements Body spread throughout the Luo family and eventually became known across the entire Southern Domain.

Luo Xiong could no longer bear his guilt and said goodbye to Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue before leaving Bīngjí Island, determined to wander the Tianyuan Continent in search of a cure for Luo Tian.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue remained in Bīngjí Island, as Luo Tian was still young and a commoner. The Luo family couldn’t afford to have no one to control the main line.

The sudden change in the Luo family’s attitude toward Luo Tian made him unsure of what he had done wrong. His usual kind uncle, who used to be affectionate toward him, now looked at him coldly and turned his head away. Even the sisters who used to play with him no longer did so.

But little Luo Tian didn’t suffer any special treatment; although Luo Xiong had left Bīngjí Island, his authority remained. With Luo Nantian in charge, the Luo family’s main line was still untouchable.

When little Luo Tian turned eight years old, a man in Daoist robes entered Bīngjí Island. He claimed to be the one who had found a cure for Luo Tian, which made Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue overjoyed.

Luo Tian also learned the name of this strange person in the scene—Yin Tianxiong.

Yin Tianxiong observed Luo Tian’s condition and frowned for a while before speaking. His words immediately made Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue’s faces pale.

“This child won’t live past ten years old!” Yin Tianxiong spoke softly, his gaze deep and serious as he looked at Luo Tian.

Hearing Yin Tianxiong’s words, people who had heard of him considered it a rare opportunity. His words made Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue believe in him without doubt.

Chapter 468: Nine Cycles of Rebirth ()

Chapter 468: Nine Cycles of Rebirth

Hearing that Luo Tian wouldn’t live past ten years old, Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue couldn’t help but rush to Yin Tianxiong for help.

Yin Tianxiong gazed at the sky with a deep gaze, making people feel he was thinking. But to Luo Tian’s eyes, it felt like Yin Tianxiong smiled at him and looked directly at himself. This made Luo Tian’s heart surge with waves.

Yin Tianxiong only glanced at him before returning his gaze and chatting with Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue. Then he began to explain Luo Tian’s situation.

But this all went unheard by Luo Tian, as if his senses were sealed. If he had a physical body at that moment, he would have been astonished.

Yin Tianxiong was indeed a rare genius of his time and had a way to save Luo Tian. The condition was for him to seal an ancient ice dragon in Bīngjí Island, and Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue would guard the seal for nine thousand years. Nine thousand years, they couldn’t leave the seal even a step.

Zhang Qiu Yue, overwhelmed by maternal love, didn’t hesitate to agree. Luo Nantian had no other choice; he couldn’t watch his son die, so he also agreed.

After Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue left, the entire Luo family fell into chaos. The Luo family’s main line also declined.

After taking Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue to the sealing place, Yin Tianxiong returned to the Luo family. He marked nine seals on little Luo Tian before leaving the Luo family.

With all his loved ones gone, little Luo Tian felt lonely. The Luo family’s main line abandoned him because of little Luo Tian, and the other lines became the dominant faction. They oppressed the Luo family’s main line to the extreme.

Luo Tian didn’t know why he had suddenly become like this, nor did he understand why his parents had left him.

But little Luo Tian knew that their departure was to cure him. Although he was young, he could feel his mother’s tears were genuine.

Time passed day by day; little Luo Tian grew thinner, and with the Luo family’s abuse of him, sometimes he was even treated worse than a servant.

Later, some servants couldn’t bear it and gave little Luo Tian food, but they were beaten by those少爷. From then on, no one dared to give Luo Tian food.

But there was one girl who was an exception. She was the granddaughter of his second uncle, three years older than Luo Tian. While others dared not to give him food, she did. Whenever someone bullied little Luo Tian, the girl would stand in front of him to protect his weak body.

The family’s coldness made little Luo Tian feel desperate, but the girl's protection was like a ray of sunlight in winter, warming his young heart.

Yin Tianxiong’s words seemed to come true; when Luo Tian turned ten, his already weak body rapidly lost its life force. At that moment, only a thirteen-year-old girl was by his side, her face full of tears.

“This is my first life!” Luo Tian whispered in his heart. At this moment, he no longer resented Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue.

He understood what his parents had done for him. For nine thousand years in the depths of Bīngjí Island, a cold and desolate place, they had silently guarded the seal to exchange for his son’s chance of survival.

Time reversed; Luo Tian arrived at his second life, born into a wealthy family but still not surviving past ten.

Third life… fourth life… until the ninth life, Luo Tian became an orphan and was adopted by Chen Yunting’s father, Chen Dazhuang. Only then did Luo Tian live past ten years old.

With each life he lived, Yin Tianxiong’s seals on Luo Tian faded one by one.

In the final life, after being expelled from the sect and falling into the Wàng Yōu Pool, merging with the Ji Yuan Book, it stopped. The following scene was a blur of chaos.

“Buzz…” A strong repulsion force formed on Luo Tian’s soul, pushing it out and returning him to his physical body.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue, who had been guarding Luo Tian’s body, showed a hint of joy as they watched his soul return.

Luo Tian opened his eyes; tears had already filled his face. He looked at his parents and fell to his knees, trembling as he spoke: “Father, Mother! I am unworthy!”

“Stupid kid, you finally recognized me?” Luo Nantian flew over and waved his hand, slapping Luo Tian’s face.

Luo Tian didn’t dodge; a happy smile spread across his face as he looked at the approaching hand, tears glistening.

Just as Luo Nantian’s hand was about to touch Luo Tian’s face, Zhang Qiu Yue stopped him with a gesture. Her pale face showed a touch of affection: “You dare to hit my son?”

Luo Nantian was only a spiritual body, and even one hundred Soul-Formation masters wouldn’t match Zhang Qiu Yue’s true self.

Zhang Qiu Yue slightly pulled his hand, and Luo Nantian was sent flying dozens of feet before stopping.

“Mother!” Luo Tian rushed to embrace Zhang Qiu Yue, his face showing guilt as he looked at the blood on her body. He felt a knot in his heart and wanted to speak but didn’t know how.

“Child, don’t feel guilty; it’s my fault for leaving you alone and lonely!” Zhang Qiu Yue gently combed Luo Tian’s head, her eyes more tender.

“Caring mothers spoil their children; Qiu Yue, you can’t indulge him like this! Who didn’t suffer when they were young?” Luo Nantian’s voice echoed from afar.

In an instant, Luo Nantian appeared before the mother and son, his eyes also red with emotion.

“Go away, eight thousand years! You didn’t miss your son, but I did!” Zhang Qiu Yue, like a mother hen, protected Luo Tian.

“Mother, father also did it for my good!” Luo Tian wiped his tears, his heart filled with excitement.

Luo Tian was now extremely excited; his entire being was occupied by parental love and affection. He could clearly feel that if anyone wanted to take his life, his parents would fight with them.

“Alright, from now on, stay by my and your father’s side and focus on cultivation. Everything else I’ve arranged for you!” Zhang Qiu Yue, full of affection, spoke softly.

“Mother, I’ve grown up; I’m no longer a child!” Luo Tian naturally wanted to stay with his parents, but many things still needed him to do.

“That’s the attitude of my son!” Luo Nantian smiled, and he pulled out an item resembling a token and tossed it into Luo Tian’s hands.

“Xian Gu Dao Ling!” Zhang Qiu Yue showed a touch of confusion on her face, looking at Luo Nantian.

Luo Nantian smiled and pulled out a scroll, throwing it into the sky.

“Buzz…” The scroll unfurled, radiating golden light that illuminated the entire sky like a sun. Zhang Daotian’s figure was reflected in the scroll.

“Respect your elder!”

“Master!” Luo Tian and Luo Nantian’s family bowed in reverence.

“My first gift to you is reuniting with your parents. Remember, no matter what they did, it was for your good, even if their methods were extreme!” Zhang Daotian spoke with a gentle smile.

“This Xian Gu Dao Ling is my second gift to you! I still have things to do, so you must strive for a while. This is the main token of Xian Gu Dao Ling; it’s not owned by any sect. This token is personally given to you by me, unrelated to any sect!”

“As for the third gift, it’s in Xian Gu Yidi!” Zhang Daotian spoke with a mysterious expression.

“Remember, be careful in Xian Gu Yidi; don’t be arrogant. There are always higher beings beyond the sky and people beyond humans. The Tianyuan Continent has countless talents; don’t fall into a trap! Also, your elder brothers will enter Xian Gu Yidi as well. Listen to them!” Zhang Daotian smiled gently.

After Zhang Daotian’s words, he vanished, and the scroll fell into Luo Nantian’s hands.

“I knew you had this main token of Xian Gu Dao Ling!” Zhang Qiu Yue frowned, showing a hint of disdain.

“Son, come here; I also have a gift for you. I left in a hurry and didn’t bring anything, but on my way through the Northern Sea, I killed a Soul-Formation level water dragon!” Leng Qiuchan boasted as she waved her hand.

“Boom…” As if a mountain fell to the ground, a hundred-foot-long body resembling a fish landed on the ground.
