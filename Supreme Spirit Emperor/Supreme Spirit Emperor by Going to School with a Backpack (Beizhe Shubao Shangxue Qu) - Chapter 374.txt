“What’s going on!” Subsequently, Fu Xingyue and Jin Ziyang displayed expressions of disbelief, their gazes turning toward the black Nascent Soul.

The wailing sound still did not cease; the black Nascent Soul collapsed with a thunderous crash, dark mist swirling violently within its massive form. The colossal body rolled across the ground repeatedly.

Meanwhile, the two ox-headed Nascent Souls halted their attacks as if drawn by an unseen force. They lifted their white bone staves, standing motionless in bewilderment.

“Physical attacks worked against him! His Highness the Prince’s insight was indeed correct!” Luotian, after repelling the enemy, returned to Fu Xingyue’s side. His eyes gleamed with surprise but his body was battered, riddled with wounds.

“Damn it!” Subsequently, Tu Feiyang and the others recalled the cost of having Luotian fight. Each sacrifice was a painful blow—equivalent to an approaching King’s full power. In this era of the Epoch Peak, such a strike could annihilate any formidable opponent.

“Damn it! My Seven-Step Stomp!” Man Hun’s expression turned bitter, his eyes filled with regret. He had not anticipated Luotian surviving to wound the terrifying Nascent Soul so severely.

Chapter 1492: Don’t Believe You, Look

“Even the Blood-Lusting Pills weren’t consumed!” Tu Feiyang’s heart ached. If Luotian had taken the pills, his death would have been acceptable—providing insight into this terrifying Nascent Soul. The fact that physical attacks worked was a revelation.

Yet Luotian had done nothing but withstand one attack from the black Nascent Soul and returned unscathed. This left Tu Feiyang and his companions thoroughly disheartened.

“Don’t dwell on it. Since physical attacks are effective, let’s strike swiftly and finish him off—avoid complications!” Fu Xingyue observed the three with a gleam of schadenfreude.

“My luck is truly astonishing! Any plan I think of succeeds!” Tu Feiyang consoled himself, his gaze brimming with pride as he soared into the air toward the black Nascent Soul.

“Is it truly effective?” Jin Ziyang and the others also bore expressions of pain, then launched themselves toward the rolling black Nascent Soul.

“Die!” Tu Feiyang surged ahead, his fists wrapped in crimson runes as he smashed into the black Nascent Soul.

“Boom…” Tu Feiyang’s overconfidence was evident; his powerful punch struck the Nascent Soul. He reasoned that Luotian, at the early Epoch stage, had inflicted such damage—how much more could he achieve as a late Epoch prodigy?

The crimson fist plunged into the Nascent Soul’s body. Tu Feiyang stood there, face cold: “Break!”

Tu Feiyang roared without sensing anything amiss. After all, Luotian had also driven his fist into the Nascent Soul’s body before inflicting damage.

At the same time, Jin Ziyang and Fan Jingyu launched their attacks, fists radiating overwhelming power that plunged into the Nascent Soul’s body.

Man Hun lagged slightly, his steps hesitating until the others’ attacks had already entered the Nascent Soul’s body. Then, he took a step forward—but his face contorted in shock as the Nascent Soul’s hand materialized, slapping him backward with a thunderous roar.

“Roar…” The Nascent Soul’s furious howl echoed through the heavens. A massive black hand凝聚ed, slapping Tu Feiyang and the others with ferocity.

Though the Nascent Soul possessed intelligence, it was incomplete. The previous “ant” had wounded it, inciting its fury. Now, three more “ants” dared to attack it—this was an insult beyond endurance. It would crush them all as retribution.

“Nothing to worry about! Earlier, it also conjured an attack, and it will shatter soon!” Tu Feiyang, Jin Ziyang, and Fan Jingyu murmured, waiting for the Nascent Soul to be annihilated by their combined might.

But soon, their faces changed abruptly—no sight of the black hand disintegrating nor the Nascent Soul’s agonized cries.

“Buzz…” The black hand crashed down, slapping the three men’s bodies. Their faces still bore shock as they were struck.

“Boom…” The deafening sound echoed. Tu Feiyang, Jin Ziyang, and Fan Jingyu were flung away, blood spewing from their mouths. Their eyes still held shock as their bodies emitted cracking sounds.

“What in the world is going on!” Man Hun’s gaze also held disbelief as he took a step forward, his body exploding in size to intercept the three mid-air.

“Crack…” The three figures collided with Man Hun’s body like meteors.

“Stomp… stomp… stomp…” Man Hun’s massive body retreated, staggering hundreds of feet before halting. A trail of enormous footprints marked his path.

“Cough… cough…” Man Hun placed the three on the ground, and they coughed blood violently. Their bodies were drenched in crimson, as if a single touch would shatter them. This was the strength of their bodies; even an ordinary late Epoch being would be annihilated in this strike, leaving no chance for rebirth. This was an attack near the Epoch Peak level—truly unbearable.

“Damn it! Physical attacks were effective, weren’t they!” Tu Feiyang panted heavily, cursing aloud. His gaze turned to Luotian.

“You damned fool—give me a reasonable explanation, or even if the Star Moon Clan protects you, I’ll still kill you!” Tu Feiyang shouted, his voice cold.

“The Star Moon Clan’s Grand Commander—those aren’t good people at all!” Jin Ziyang’s face also bore coldness, his gaze on Luotian. He recalled the scene of Luotian trampling him in the Star Moon Clan, transferring his hatred toward the current Gu Sansi.

“Your incompetence is to blame!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes held mockery, gazing at the three coughing blood and pale-faced.

“Cough… cough…” Upon hearing Fu Xingyue’s words, the three coughed violently again, blood flowing down their mouths.

“Death…” But soon, a cold voice echoed in their ears—a dark body formed above them, coalescing into an immense maw to devour them.

“Use the King’s Armaments to annihilate it!” Seeing the Nascent Soul abandoning the ox-headed souls and devouring them, Tu Feiyang and the others could no longer contain themselves. They roared at Fu Xingyue.

“You’re incapable—don’t blame others. Watch me annihilate it!” Fu Xingyue’s gaze held disdain as he soared into the sky, his body radiating pure light. He punched toward the black maw.

“Lord Commander, I’ll assist you!” Luotian smiled inwardly but spoke aloud, then dashed behind Fu Xingyue, striking with a fist as well.

“You’re seeking death!” Tu Feiyang, Jin Ziyang, and Fan Jingyu gazed at the two as if they were ants, their eyes filled with contempt. After all, they believed Luotian’s success was mere luck—perhaps he had struck a weakness.

“Roar…” But soon, an agonized cry made them widen their eyes in disbelief.

The black body collapsed under the combined attacks of Luotian and Fu Xingyue, crashing onto the ground before Tu Feiyang’s group.

“Impossible!” Tu Feiyang, Jin Ziyang, Fan Jingyu, and Man Hun gaped at the massive black Nascent Soul now before them, its aura weak—far worse than before.

“Roar…” The Nascent Soul howled, its body凝聚ed again. Crimson eyes scanned the sky toward Luotian and Fu Xingyue, then fear flickered in its eyes as it turned to the three men who had just risen. It sensed they were soft targets, and these three were companions of the two above.

“Buzz…” Another black hand凝聚ed, slapping Tu Feiyang and the others fiercely.

“Big brother, did you mistake us? It was them who wounded you!” Tu Feiyang and the others felt like vomiting, but this time they were prepared. A radiant light appeared before them.

“Crack…” The barrier had just formed when the black hand struck it.

The three barriers held for a breath before shattering, and the black hand smashed into their bodies.

“Puke…” This time, four figures were flung back—Man Hun included—but this was better than before. The Nascent Soul had been wounded by Luotian, and they were prepared.

Four沉闷 sounds echoed as the four fell back a hundred feet, collapsing on the ground but never rising.

“What did we do to deserve this!” Tu Feiyang and the others nearly cried, their bodies were severely wounded—feeling as if they had been smashed apart.

“Why didn’t you resist? Physical attacks were effective!” Fu Xingyue spoke again, causing the four to nearly explode with rage. Their eyes bore resentment, like a scorned woman.

“Yes, it was effective!” Fu Xingyang, naturally no good person, would not miss this chance to torment them. He dashed toward the Nascent Soul as well.

Fu Xingxuan said nothing, but her purple eyes held disdain—unbearable.

“Ladies and gentlemen, rest well. This labor-intensive task is mine!” Luotian would not let Fu Xingyue and the others confront the Nascent Soul. He flashed forward, his fist wrapped in pure light, striking the Nascent Soul’s body.

“Puke…” No surprise—pure fists plunged into the Nascent Soul’s body, then invisible waves spread within it.

“Roar…” Painful cries echoed from the Nascent Soul, followed by black mist spreading across the heavens. Under Tu Feiyang’s group’s shock, the mighty Nascent Soul was annihilated by Luotian and the others’ fists.

“Was it really over so quickly?” Tu Feiyang’s group gaped, watching Luotian and Fu Xingyue descend before them.

“Have you surrendered?” Fu Xingyue’s eyes held a hint of pride as he spoke to Jin Ziyang, who lay on the ground.

“Surrendered! I truly surrender!” Man Hun’s face bore admiration as he gazed at Luotian and the others.

Chapter 1493: Soul-Calling Curse

“Have you surrendered?” Hearing Fu Xingyue’s mocking words, Tu Feiyang and Jin Ziyang’s faces reddened. Their gazes turned to Luotian—three men were not fools; they now suspected Luotian had a method to subdue the black Nascent Soul.

Man Hun said nothing, but after admiring for a while, his face turned regretful, lamenting his Seven-Step Stomp.

“Brother, we are all from the Ancient Kings’ Clan—don’t hand over your Seven-Step Stomp to others!” Man Hun’s eyes were filled with despair, his gaze pleading toward Luotian. This was the second time he had given it away.

The first time, forced by Luotian, was understandable. But this time, he had given it voluntarily—this left Man Hun embarrassed.

Luotian could have let Sa Man challenge or even kill him, but now it was different. Not only had he given it voluntarily, but the current Grand Commander of Star Moon Guard was also present. Man Hun could not kill him in Fu Xingyue’s presence.

“Rest assured, Lord Man— I can swear blood oaths not to teach anyone else!” Luotian’s eyes held respect, but inwardly he sighed: “The battle spear was learned by himself; I doubt he would want me to.”

“That’s good!” Man Hun, seeing Luotian swear, sighed deeply. He knew this would anger his clan upon returning, but Sa Man and the approaching King were in seclusion. For now, he was the strongest in the Beast Clan.

“Clang…” A black stone fell from the sky, causing Luotian’s group to slightly change expression.

“What is this thing?” Next moment, Tu Feiyang, recovering somewhat, dashed toward the black stone.

The others’ faces also changed abruptly, but Tu Feiyang was the fastest. Though injured, he still outpaced them.

“Haha! My luck is unmatched! This black stone must be no ordinary item!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes gleamed with pride. He knew this black stone was surely related to the annihilated Nascent Soul. That soul had not been ordinary—perhaps it had been a great power before.

“Buzz…” As he mused, Tu Feiyang did not hesitate and reached for the black stone.

But just as he was about to grasp it, a suction force emanated from behind him, directly affecting the black stone.

“Swoosh…” A dark light flashed before Tu Feiyang, making his face grim. He turned sharply.

“Boom…” The black stone landed steadily in Luotian’s hands, causing his brows to furrow.

A cold aura surged into Luotian’s body, directly affecting his Nascent Soul, making his expression serious.

Invisible waves wrapped around Luotian’s Nascent Soul, as if trying to pull it out and absorb it into the black stone.

“This is… a Soul-Calling Stone!” Luotian exclaimed, his gaze turning serious. He exchanged glances with Fu Xingyue and the others.

“What?” Hearing Luotian’s words, Fu Xingyue’s group also changed faces, gazing at the black stone in Luotian’s hands.

A Soul-Calling Stone was a strange object—completely cold. If thrown on the ground and not picked up, it would be mistaken for an ordinary stone. However, to normal people, it was just a common rock. But to Nascent Souls, it was deadly—small pieces could absorb the soul of an adult man. This large piece was truly rare.

“Such a big Soul-Calling Stone—its value is immeasurable!” Fu Xingyue’s face bore admiration, gazing at the stone. This Soul-Calling Stone could autonomously absorb unclaimed Nascent Souls, making it an invaluable item for soul cultivators.

“Give it to me!” Next moment, Jin Ziyang and the others gazed at Luotian with intense eyes, their gazes dangerous.

At this point, they were on the verge of explosion. Luotian had first extorted them of priceless treasures; now, after their injuries, all the good things were taken by Luotian and Fu Xingyue’s group. No one could swallow this.

Fu Xingyue obtaining it, they might still endure—but Luotian, a mere early Epoch commander—when had they ever considered him?

“You’re really shameless! We killed the Nascent Soul, and we didn’t stop giving you chances to attack. You couldn’t fight, so we did. Now you want to steal the Soul-Calling Stone? You’re truly… prodigies…” Fu Xingyue’s eyes held disdain as he gazed at Tu Feiyang, emphasizing the word “prodigies.”

“Lord Man, I’m not unwilling to give it. It just flew into my hands! Even if I did give it to you, you’d regret it!” Luotian spoke softly, gazing at Tu Feiyang with a faint smile.

“Don’t lie! What do you mean by ‘regret’? Give it to me quickly, or I’ll make sure you’re careful next time!” Tu Feiyang shouted at Luotian, his voice still threatening.

“Alright, since you all want it so much, I’ll give it to you!” Luotian’s face still bore a bitter smile, but inwardly he laughed. He approached Tu Feiyang and the others, handing over the black Soul-Calling Stone.

“You’re wise!” Tu Feiyang and the others’ faces bore joy as they reached for the palm-sized Soul-Calling Stone.

“Let’s split it evenly!” Jin Ziyang addressed the three, and each grabbed a corner of the stone, beginning to discuss.

“Did they really give it to them?” Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan approached Luotian, asking.

“Don’t worry—soon they’ll beg me to take it back!” Luotian smiled, crossing his arms.

“This kid—again, he’s up to no good. I’ve never seen him lose,” Fu Xingyue was the most familiar with Luotian among the three.

Hearing Fu Xingyue’s words, Fu Xingxuan raised her eyebrows, recalling the times Luotian had suffered under her command. She felt a hint of satisfaction.

As they spoke, Tu Feiyang and the others began to split the Soul-Calling Stone.

But as soon as they applied force, their faces changed abruptly—gray mist emanated from the black Soul-Calling Stone, forming four gray runes that flew toward Tu Feiyang and the others.

“Something’s wrong! Let go!” The four immediately sensed the change, quickly releasing their hands and retreating to dodge the gray runes.

However, despite releasing their hands, their faces remained pale—because they discovered their gray Nascent Souls were still attached to the black Soul-Calling Stone.

“Buzz…” The gray runes instantly pierced into their bodies, wrapping around their Nascent Souls, causing them to feel a bad premonition.

“What is this? Damn it, someone tampered with the Soul-Calling Stone!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes held fear and anger, feeling his Nascent Soul being pulled by an unknown force toward the black stone.

“Damn it, Gu Sansi, what did you do!” Jin Ziyang and Fan Jingyu also shouted, gazing at Luotian with anger. Even the usually naive Man Hun roared.

Fear spread in their hearts, a soul-level terror that could truly kill them.

“Ladies and gentlemen, this isn’t my fault! I just grabbed the stone, and you wanted to kill me. The time it was in my hands was less than five breaths—what could I have done?” Luotian’s face bore innocence as he spoke to Tu Feiyang and the others.

“Stop talking! We don’t want it anymore—take it away!” Tu Feiyang and Jin Ziyang shouted, feeling their Nascent Souls were already out of control, being pulled by the gray runes.

“No… no… no! I dare not! If I take it away, you’ll still kill me!” Luotian’s face showed a hint of panic as he shook his head.

Hearing Luotian’s words, Tu Feiyang and the others’ faces turned ashen. They wanted to threaten but their Nascent Souls trembled.

“Buzz…” As the four didn’t know what to say, the four gray runes pulled their Nascent Souls out, and their hands also plunged into the black Soul-Calling Stone.

“Hmm?” Luotian furrowed his brows, gazing at the black Soul-Calling Stone. He naturally knew it had been strange—capable of attracting unclaimed souls, and even when he grabbed it, it had tried to pull his Nascent Soul out.

“Soul-Calling Curse!” Luotian’s heart trembled, and after observing carefully, he finally recognized what the runes were.

“How is this possible!” Luotian even couldn’t help but exclaim, his eyes filled with disbelief, shaking his head repeatedly.

“What is a Soul-Calling Curse?” Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan’s faces bore confusion as they gazed at Luotian.

“This is the method of a Soul-Sealing Master!” Luotian spoke, his voice heavy.

“What? You mean we’ve been cursed by a Soul-Sealing Master!” Tu Feiyang’s face changed abruptly, his eyes filled with disbelief. He had once competed with Luotian for this inheritance in the Cutting Heaven Domain, and he deeply knew the terror of a Soul-Sealing Master.

“Damn it, why is this thing here in the Afterlife! Did Luotian’s bastard be here!” Tu Feiyang only knew that Luotian had seized the inheritance of a Soul-Sealing Master, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Chapter 1494: Seventh-Generation Soul-Sealing Master

“It’s impossible! Luotian couldn’t be here in the Afterlife!” Tu Feiyang spoke out, gazing at Luotian standing before Fu Xingyue.

“Brother, take it quickly! I’ll grant you one condition!” Tu Feiyang and the others guessed Luotian’s oddity—first, he had wounded the terrifying black Nascent Soul with physical attacks; then, he had grabbed the Soul-Calling Stone without issue. Everything was strange.

But now, they were at someone else’s doorstep and had to bow their heads. No matter what Luotian was up to, their lives were now in the hands of this Soul-Calling Stone. If they messed it up, they would die the most inexplicable death in history.

“Alright!” Luotian nodded, knowing he couldn’t push too hard. After all, if these four died here, Fu Xingyue’s group wouldn’t fare well either.

Thinking of this, Luotian flew toward the four, waved his hand, and retrieved the black Soul-Calling Stone. Upon contact, that cold aura instantly returned to his mind.

Luotian inwardly sneered; he was also a Soul-Sealing Master, so he naturally understood this soul-binding curse. His vast Nascent Soul power formed runes, rushing into the stone, and invisible waves spread outward.

“Boom… boom…” As Luotian’s Nascent Soul power spread, the gray runes pulling Tu Feiyang and the others shattered.

“Go…” The four didn’t care about Luotian’s fate; in their minds, if Luotian died, it would be better.

The four fell to the ground pale-faced, gazing at Luotian clutching the Soul-Calling Stone. Their faces bore anticipation—hoping Luotian’s Nascent Soul would be pulled out by the stone.

“Buzz…” The suction force acted on Luotian’s Nascent Soul, making his face cold and devoid of fear. Gray Nascent Souls emerged from his body, rushing into the stone.

“Let me see where you are!” Luotian’s tangible Nascent Soul appeared in the black space, gazing around.

“Unexpectedly, I met someone like me here!” A low, raspy voice echoed beneath the black space.

“Who are you?” Luotian’s gaze was sharp, scanning around before seeing a phantom figure appear in his vision. This made Luotian’s heart wary.

A沧桑 aura echoed beneath the black space, a phantom old man appearing in Luotian’s vision.

“You are the seventh-generation Soul-Sealing Master?” The old man spoke softly, his eyes carrying a hint of amusement, as if a kind elder. He scrutinized Luotian’s powerful Nascent Soul but saw intense greed in his eyes.

“Ninth-generation!” Luotian coldly replied. The old man’s aura was powerful, but it paled in comparison to his own. Luotian was confident that if he wished, one punch could annihilate the old man.

However, Luotian knew this old man’s Nascent Soul was not his true self but a fragment of his consciousness. As for why it appeared here, Luotian was unclear.

“Good. I suppose I am your senior. I’ve waited for you deep in the Afterlife. When that time comes, everything will belong to me!” The old man smiled, speaking to Luotian.

“Do you want to devour me?” Luotian’s face bore coldness, then his gray Nascent Soul rushed toward the old man. No matter who he was, in this Nascent Soul state, he had no fear. He闪动 and appeared before the old man, his gray fist swinging toward him.

“Boom…” The old man’s phantom Nascent Soul shattered under Luotian’s punch, then scattered into gray mist, spreading around.

“Everyone is from the same source; your attack has no effect on me!” The old man’s voice echoed in the black space, instantly vanishing from Luotian’s vision.

“Running away?” Luotian felt wary, knowing the old man was likely a great power with deep ties to Soul-Sealing Masters.

“Buzz…” Gray mist emanated from the black Soul-Calling Stone, appearing in Tu Feiyang’s group’s vision.

“Has he been annihilated?” Seeing the gray Nascent Soul energy, Tu Feiyang’s group bore a hint of joy, believing it was Luotian’s Nascent Soul.

But their joy hadn’t faded before a沧桑 aura appeared in their perception, the old man appearing in their vision. His gaze swept over them, eyes filled with admiration.

“Young bodies—after so many years, the Afterlife has finally seen someone!” The old man spoke softly, then transformed into a black light, flying away.

“Can’t escape!” But just as the old man took off, a cold voice echoed in the gray world. Two piercing lights emerged from Luotian’s body as he slowly opened his eyes.

“Buzz…” Luotian extended his hand, a powerful suction force emanating from it.

Under this immense suction, the entire world’s gray mist swirled, and the old man’s Nascent Soul twisted instantly, appearing in Luotian’s hands.

“What technique is this? Why can’t I understand it!” The old man’s Nascent Soul bore disbelief.

“Soul-Stealing!” Luotian ignored the old man’s shock, his cold voice echoing through the world. Waves acted on the old man’s Nascent Soul.

In an instant, fragments of memories appeared in Luotian’s mind, making his face turn serious.

In the old man’s memories, Luotian learned of his identity—once a great power, and deeply connected to himself. He was the seventh-generation Soul-Sealing Master!

The Cutting Heaven Lord was the eighth-generation, and this old man was clearly an older existence.

Luotian also learned from the Cutting Heaven Lord’s memories that the Soul-Sealing Master lineage truly became powerful starting with the seventh-generation. Previous generations were strong but remained within the same epoch, and even in the era of the Breaking Heaven Lord, no true great power had emerged. The strongest was merely at the early epoch stage.

It wasn’t until the seventh-generation Soul-Sealing Master appeared that if not for his presence in the era of the Breaking Heaven Lord, the Cutting Heaven Lord might never have achieved enlightenment.

In this Nascent Soul’s memories, Luotian saw the seventh-generation Soul-Sealing Master’s later years—entering this Afterlife, sitting on an altar as if suppressing something. He never moved again, and even his descendants didn’t know when he had achieved enlightenment.

“Qiu Jingming!” Luotian sighed softly, the old man was indeed his senior. But clearly, he had used some method to prolong his life.

“Great power!” Luotian didn’t need to guess—Qiu Jingming must have been incredibly powerful and cultivated the Soul-Sealing Master lineage. Even the Cutting Heaven Lord’s inheritance was left by him.

“Why has he entered the Afterlife again? And what connection do these souls in the Afterlife have with Qiu Jingming? Is this his escape route?” Luotian felt a surge of questions, his admiration immense.

“If he’s alive, then he’s too absurd. But seeing that residual soul, something must have happened—otherwise it wouldn’t be so evil!” Luotian muttered, retrieving the Soul-Calling Stone.

At the same time, a strong sense of crisis arose in Luotian’s heart. If he continued to delve deeper, he would inevitably face the old man’s original body. In this Afterlife filled with souls, the old man had a significant advantage. Even though Luotian was also a Soul-Sealing Master, he wasn’t sure if he could defeat the ancestor of the Soul-Sealing Masters. After all, his methods were fully known to the old man.

“What’s wrong?” Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan approached Luotian, their eyes filled with concern.

“There’s a great enemy ahead—very dangerous. Perhaps we can’t withstand it. Even with the King’s Armaments, we might not survive!” Luotian spoke seriously, gazing at them before crushing the old man’s residual soul.

“What danger?” Fu Xingyue’s group’s eyes narrowed; they naturally believed Luotian.

“It might be the seventh-generation Soul-Sealing Master!” Luotian spoke softly, his words echoing in their minds. Fu Xingyue’s group’s faces also slightly changed.

“Is he still alive?” They had some understanding of the Soul-Sealing Master’s existence due to Luotian, so their faces were filled with shock.

“Possibly alive, or something terrible might have happened!” Luotian replied, then spoke to them: “So I hope you can leave. The souls that erupted in the Afterlife are likely related to him!”

“What about you?” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes bore worry, then a hint of determination. If Luotian was going deep, she would accompany him.

“Buzz…” As the four exchanged thoughts, Tu Feiyang and the others slowly stood up, gazing at Luotian.

“Who are you? Why weren’t you affected by the Soul-Calling Stone! That was a Soul-Sealing Master’s soul-calling curse, not something a mere early epoch commander could withstand!” Tu Feiyang gazed at Luotian, scrutinizing him carefully before his eyes bore disappointment—nothing could be seen on Luotian.

“I was absorbed into it the moment I touched the Soul-Calling Stone, but I saw the old man’s soul. After battling him, I finally defeated it!” Luotian explained softly. Whether they believed him or not was beyond his control. At this point, with them in the Afterlife’s depths, he didn’t fear exposing his identity. If a fight broke out, Luotian was confident he could suppress them.

Chapter 1495: Soul-Calling Mountain

“Let’s go!” Tu Feiyang and the others naturally didn’t believe Luotian, but they didn’t doubt his identity. After all, they wouldn’t risk entering their Ancient Kings’ Clan’s territory under such circumstances.

They were merely cautious of Fu Xingyue and the others, as their protection of Luotian was evident.

Moreover, Luotian had a certain role in the Afterlife, even achieving unexpected results several times.

Fu Xingxuan wouldn’t leave; Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang naturally wouldn’t either. The four adjusted again, heading deeper into the Afterlife.

In the gray mist, they cautiously walked, though no accidents occurred. Their hearts remained tense, especially Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue, who never put away their Star Moon Spears. Luotian’s words still echoed in their ears; they couldn’t be careless.

Time passed slowly, and the four walked for nearly three hours in the gray mist. The entire world was eerily quiet, with no living beings—like entering a dead land. But they eventually discovered a massive building complex.

The buildings were still in ruins, with skeletons scattered on the ground. The bones exuded a decaying aura. Luotian kicked one skeleton, which shattered into white powder, scattering on the gray earth.

“These skeletons—those who were at least in the Epoch stage. How could even these Epoch-stage remains withstand time’s erosion!” Tu Feiyang sighed softly.

“Have you heard of the Afterlife’s origins?” Jin Ziyang asked, his gaze filled with admiration as he addressed Fu Xingyue and the others.

“Hearing some, but not sure if it’s true!” Fu Xingyue and the others bore a hint of melancholy, recalling a humiliating history of the Ancient Kings.

“Stories are true—this is indeed where the Human Race’s Breaking Heaven Lord annihilated the Ancient Kings. That battle saw the Breaking Heaven Lord destroy countless Ancient Kings, leading the Human Race to rise. It was then that the Ancient Kings first realized the terror of the Human Race—when a single Epoch Master emerged, they were truly formidable!” Jin Ziyang sighed deeply, gazing toward the Afterlife’s depths.

“Yet after annihilating countless Ancient Kings, the Breaking Heaven Lord vanished from everyone’s sight! He never appeared again—only leaving legends!”

“Even so, the Ancient Kings dared not act against the Human Race. Even in seclusion, they were terrified for two epochs!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes bore humiliation, recalling the scene of his ancestors being annihilated by the Breaking Heaven Lord.

“Later, someone saw the Breaking Heaven Lord’s figure entering the Afterlife’s depths and never returning. He left no descendants, going alone into the Afterlife—no one knows where he went. Only a divine light burst from the Afterlife’s depths, piercing through heaven and earth!” Fan Jingyu’s eyes held admiration.
