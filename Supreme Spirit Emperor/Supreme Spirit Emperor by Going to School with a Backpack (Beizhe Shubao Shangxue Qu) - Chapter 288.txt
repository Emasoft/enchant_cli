“Stop talking. My decision is final. The Epoch Scripture is the exclusive sacred artifact of the Epoch Lord, but we should know our situation—achieving the status of an Epoch Lord is impossible now. This era no longer belongs to us!” Long Xin Yuan let out a long sigh, his voice heavy with resignation. To achieve the title of Epoch Lord—how could anyone not be moved? Yet Long Xin Yuan knew they were already dead, surviving only through extraordinary means.

“Fine,” Feng Feichen sighed in response to Long Xin Yuan’s words, his expression darkening with a touch of melancholy. He fell silent.

“Young man, your luck is commendable,” Feng Feichen spoke, his tone still condescending as if bestowing a favor. Yet their deep bond meant he listened to Long Xin Yuan’s words, no longer intending to attack Luo Tian.

“Who’s the lucky one?” Luo Tian inwardly sneered, his face betraying no emotion as he stood behind Diaoyuan Shan.

“During this journey to the Four Sacred Star Domains, we will protect you with all our might. But I hope that after surviving this trial, when you achieve great power, you will safeguard our Demon Domain,” Long Xin Yuan said with a smile, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Of course,” Luo Tian bowed respectfully. Inwardly, he chuckled—Long Jie had essentially become the ruler of the Demon Domain. If Long Jie faced danger, he would naturally intervene.

“Good,” Long Xin Yuan said, no longer wasting words. He waved his hand, and with a flick of his wrist, he and Luo Tian along with Diaoyuan Shan vanished like teleportation, instantly appearing atop the Divine Clan’s Sacred Mountain.

At that moment, within a grand hall of the Divine Clan’s sacred mountain, twenty or so elders sat in solemn silence, their eyes meeting with expressions of deep contemplation.

“Time changes everything. How unexpected that we should meet again,” said Sun Yinhang, a senior figure of the Divine Clan’s Epoch peak. His face bore a faint smile as he gazed at the hunched figures of his peers, speaking softly.

“Indeed. I never thought we’d meet again. How many years have passed? So long that I’ve forgotten,” one elder spoke, his cultivation at the late Epoch stage. His body radiated a fierce aura—this was a senior of the Shiluo Domain.

“Enough. Now is not the time for reminiscing. Regardless of past grievances, I hope you’ve all let go by now,” said a senior from the Xingluo Domain, his robe flowing as he smiled.

“Who knows how many still live in the Demon Domain?” asked a senior from the Hunhu Domain, his gray robe billowing as he spoke with a faint glint of gray in his eyes.

Among the twenty or so present, the weakest was at the early Epoch stage—Divine King Sun Shengtian. The rest were all at least mid-Epoch or higher, a force so formidable it could annihilate the entire Nine Domains.

“Haha, Sun Yinhang. I never thought you’d still be alive,” as the elders conversed, Long Xin Yuan appeared in the hall with Luo Tian and others. He laughed heartily, addressing Sun Yinhang.

“Long Xinyuan, if you’re still alive, why would I die? I feared that after rebirth, there’d be no rival,” Sun Yinhang laughed in return, his voice carrying a touch of arrogance.

“Long Elder, you’re late,” said the Shiluo Domain’s senior, his face grim but a faint smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. The contrast with his aged visage was oddly unsettling.

Luo Tian followed Long Xin Yuan’s steps, and as he appeared, his heart trembled. Each of the elders in the hall was a world-shaking powerhouse—each could obliterate him with a single strike.

“Luo Tian, I never thought you’d dare come. I expected we’d have to go fetch you ourselves,” said Divine King Sun Shengtian, his gaze sharp.

“Oh? Is this the genius with the Epoch Scripture? The one who caused the Divine Clan’s land to vanish?” Sun Yinhang smiled as he listened, his eyes scanning Luo Tian with intensity.

Others nodded in agreement, their gazes flickering with approval. Yet Luo Tian was drenched in cold sweat—those glances, though seemingly calm, bore the weight of twenty mid-Epoch and late-Epoch masters. The invisible pressure was unbearable for ordinary souls.

“Excellent,” a black-cloaked senior from the Demon Clan nodded, withdrawing his gaze. His words broke the hall’s silence.

“Hah…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his body soaked in sweat. As the Demon Clan’s senior spoke, the pressure lifted. Though only a few seconds, it felt like an eternity to Luo Tian, leaving him gasping for breath.

“Luo Tian, hand over the Epoch Scripture. You won’t deny us this courtesy, will you?” Sun Shengtian spoke with a teasing tone.

“Sun Shengtian!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold. He hadn’t expected Sun Shengtian to challenge him at this moment. The Epoch Scripture was in his possession; if he didn’t show it, it would leave a bad impression. After all, before these masters, he was powerless.

“Luo Tian, the Divine Clan’s young man’s suggestion is reasonable. Hand over the Epoch Scripture and you won’t need to go to the battlefield,” said the Hunhu Domain’s senior, his voice laced with desire. The Epoch Scripture was a sacred artifact of the Epoch Lord—anyone here would want to glimpse it. If they could glean something, perhaps they still had a chance at survival.

“Enough. Don’t torment the boy,” Long Xin Yuan interjected, stepping beside Luo Tian to shield him.

Long Xin Yuan ignored the others’ words, his gaze fixed on Sun Yinhang. Among all present, only Sun Yinhang and himself were at the Epoch peak—only Long Xin Yuan dared address Sun Yinhang thus.

Sun Yinhang’s eyes gleamed with sharpness, locking onto Long Xin Yuan before speaking softly: “I also believe the Epoch Scripture should be taken and kept here for safety.”

Upon hearing Sun Yinhang’s words, the hall erupted in joy. Sun Shengtian glared at Luo Tian with a twisted smile.

“Don’t trouble the elders. I’ll take it out myself for your viewing,” Sun Shengtian said, then took a step toward Luo Tian.

“Smack!” But before Sun Shengtian could take another step, his body abruptly reversed, blood spewing as he collided with the hall’s wall.

“You dare? We’re speaking here—do you have a right to interfere?” Long Xin Yuan’s face darkened, his palm striking Sun Shengtian with a resounding crack.

“Smack!” As Long Xin Yuan’s words echoed, Sun Shengtian’s body landed on the ground with a heavy thud.

“Long Xin Yuan, what are you doing? You’re beating one of our Divine Clan’s people on our own territory!” Before Sun Yinhang could speak, several elders from the Divine Clan—late and mid-Epoch—accosted Long Xin Yuan with sharp words.

“Divine Clan? How few of you remain?” Seven elders from the Demon Domain stood behind Long Xin Yuan, their gazes cold. Their auras rose gradually.

The Divine Clan’s elders were not fewer than the Demon Domain, perhaps even more. But people knew that before, the Divine Clan had deployed four elders to confront Gu Tianshu, leaving only five now—including Sun Yinhang.

“Enough. What time is this to quarrel?” Sun Yinhang’s eyes flickered, his hand outstretched. Golden light cascaded, instantly healing Sun Shengtian’s wounds. He rose, his face dark with resentment toward Long Xin Yuan, but he dared not offend him. His gaze lingered on Luo Tian with hatred—this debt would be added to Luo Tian’s account.

Sun Yinhang and Long Xin Yuan locked eyes, sending waves of excitement through the hall’s elders.

“Two rivals from their time—could they face off again?” murmurs spread as the elders awaited their next move.

Sun Yinhang and Long Xin Yuan had been prodigies in their era, undefeated within their domains. Their clash lasted three days and nights without resolution, both returning wounded to their respective realms. That battle had made them lifelong rivals until someone emerged and crushed them—Meng Lingyun, the Epoch Lord.

“Hum…” As they stared at each other, a humming sound rose in the hall. A surge of vitality filled the room, bringing a faint flush to the withered faces of the thirty-odd elders.

“What is this?” They discovered the source—Luo Tian beside Long Xin Yuan. Their gazes flickered with suspicion.

Green light radiated, a jade-green leaf hovering above Luo Tian’s head, exuding vitality that filled the entire hall.

“Immortal Herb!” The elders, seasoned and wise, instantly recognized the leaf’s significance.

“Young man, where did you get this Immortal Herb?” The hall was filled with hurried breaths. Each elder’s eyes burned with desire, fixated on the leaf above Luo Tian.

Unlike the Epoch Scripture, the Immortal Herb’s allure was greater for these elders. A complete Immortal Herb could extend their lives—true life, no self-sealing required, and for an entire Epoch.

“Not quite. This is the Immortal Tree!” Sun Yinhang and Long Xin Yuan’s eyes flickered, sensing a familiar aura—the same one that had once made them revere it like a mountain.

Under the elders’ stunned gazes, the green leaf transformed into swirling green light. A translucent figure materialized before them.

“Sun Yinhang, Long Xin Yuan—long time no see!” Meng Lingyun’s voice echoed through the hall. Though aged, his presence was still formidable.

“Meng Lingyun! You’re alive!” Upon seeing Meng Lingyun’s figure, Long Xin Yuan and Sun Yinhang were stunned, as if struck by lightning. Their eyes locked onto his form.

“Meng… Meng Lingyun!” The hall’s elders bore expressions of shock, their voices barely audible. They knew who Meng Lingyun was.

“Meng Lingyun, where have you been these years? Are you truly alive?” Sun Yinhang’s eyes held a glimmer of hope. If Meng Lingyun was still alive, it would be a morale booster for them—no one in the Nine Domains could oppose an Epoch Lord.

Sun Shengtian was stunned. He had heard that Luo Tian was backed by an Epoch Lord, but he’d scoffed at the idea. If Luo Tian had such a protector, his attitude toward him would have been different.

But now, Meng Lingyun stood before them—though only a shadow with no real power. Yet the saying “a man’s name, a tree’s shadow” held true. Since ancient times, no Epoch Lord had ever been challenged—words carried power, and none dared defy them.

“Call it another form of life,” Meng Lingyun replied with a smile, offering no further explanation.

“This boy is my disciple. Please look after him,” Meng Lingyun said, his gaze shifting to Luo Tian.

“An Epoch Lord’s disciple!” The elders’ gazes toward Luo Tian shifted. That single title was enough to let him roam the Nine Domains unchecked.

“Smack!” Before the elders could react, a sharp crack echoed through the hall. Sun Shengtian’s body was sent flying again, blood spewing from his mouth.

“My disciple is not one to be bullied. Be careful,” Meng Lingyun said, ignoring the elders’ reactions. The jade-green leaf of the Immortal Tree shattered and vanished from their perception.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Sun Shengtian had truly been unlucky today—this was the Divine King of the Divine Clan, yet he’d been struck twice.

“Good. With Master Lingyun’s presence, our battle is secured,” Sun Yinhang smiled, no longer caring about the fallen Sun Shengtian. His gaze toward Luo Tian softened.

Not just Sun Yinhang—everyone in the hall, except for the fallen Sun Shengtian, now regarded Luo Tian with goodwill.

Luo Tian thought to himself as he watched them change faces so quickly. He wondered what their expressions would be if they saw Meng Lingyun’s true form.

“Then there’s nothing more to discuss. It’s just a battle. Let me and Elder Long handle Meng Haoyan. Others, assign yourselves. As for Luo Tian’s safety, Sun Shengtian and the little貂 will be responsible—no need for you two to fight, just ensure his safety,” Sun Yinhang said directly.

As Sun Shengtian rose, he looked as if he’d swallowed a fly. His face was grim. Within an hour, he had been struck twice—worse still, he now had to protect the one who had caused his humiliation. This was hard for anyone to accept.

“Luo Tian’s safety is crucial. If anything happens, we’ll hold you accountable,” Long Xin Yuan and Sun Yinhang said in unison, their gazes scanning over Sun Shengtian.

The Four Sacred Star Domains were in chaos, their once-vibrant lands now silent and lifeless. Blood mist filled the air, devoid of any vitality.

Nine middle-aged men stood in space, their auras radiating power like statues as they gazed into the distance.

“Elder, do you think they’ll come?” One man’s body was shrouded in gray mist, his cultivation at mid-Epoch.

“Whether they come or not is not their choice. The power lies with us. Do they have the right to refuse?” Meng Haoyan smiled.

“Right. We can’t not come. Meng Haoyan, I remember—your name is that of Meng Lingyun’s disciple. How could the disciple of an Epoch Lord act this way? You’ve disgraced Meng Lingyun!” As Meng Haoyan’s words ended, the blood-filled space shattered. Thirty figures emerged from the void, their eyes cold as they gazed at Meng Haoyan and his nine men.

“Punctual, I see,” Meng Haoyan’s eyes flickered. He stepped forward to assess Sun Yinhang and Long Xin Yuan, but then shook his head—though their auras were at the Epoch peak, they were on death’s door. They were already buried in the earth.

“Remember? I never thought the prodigies who once vied for the title of Epoch Lord—Sun Yinhang and Long Xin Yuan—would end up like this!” Meng Haoyan continued, his voice laced with disdain.

Luo Tian stood among the crowd. He glanced at Meng Haoyan, then felt a surge of concern. Though they seemed numerous, if battle broke out, who would win was uncertain.

“Four Sacred Star Domains!” Luo Tian turned his gaze to the familiar domain, now a wasteland. Seeing the blood mist stretching across it, his killing intent surged.

“That boy is here too? I’m not disappointed,” Meng Haoyan smiled, spotting Luo Tian.

“Young man, today you won’t be so lucky. No one can save you now!” Meng Yongzhi and Meng Xiyan glared at Luo Tian, having suffered losses to him before. They hated him deeply.

“Enough talk. Let’s fight. I want to see what ability the disciple of Meng Lingyun has,” Long Xin Yuan said, transforming into a hundred-foot-long green dragon that coiled above the crowd. His aura was overwhelming.

On the other side, Sun Yinhang’s eyes gleamed as he stood straight. The elders had not brought their Epoch treasures, reserving them for the last chance to protect their sacred clans. Even if they failed, their juniors would have a fighting chance.

“Kill!” Under Long Xin Yuan and Sun Yinhang’s leadership, the elders of various clans clashed with Meng Haoyan’s nine masters, charging toward them.

“Just you?” Meng Haoyan and his men sneered. Their auras surged, unafraid as they rushed toward the elders.

Luo Tian and Diaoyuan Shan, along with Sun Shengtian, retreated to the edges of the battlefield, observing the clash.

In moments, the blood-filled space was torn apart by their attacks. Gray mist flowed from the void, and gray lightning struck down.

Sun Shengtian’s face twisted as he felt the violent energy striking his body, slicing through Luo Tian’s group.

“Smack!” Meng Haoyan’s hands moved in unison, forming a giant figure. He struck the space below with his palm, clashing against Long Xin Yuan and Sun Yinhang. The collision was deafening, each clash sending waves of Epoch power that annihilated vast stretches of space.

Other Meng Domain elders clashed with the elders, and stars were destroyed in their collisions. Gray mist filled the space, and wild waves annihilated the trio’s spiritual senses.

“Step back a bit. This level of battle is beyond our involvement,” Diaoyuan Shan said, leading Luo Tian and Sun Shengtian to the edge of the Four Sacred Star Domains. They observed the battle.

At that moment, all surviving cultivators across the Nine Domains prayed for their elders’ victory. If they failed, they knew they would perish too. To survive, the only option was to enter the Nine Secluded Lands—but even with Epoch treasures, survival was uncertain. It was no better than the Meng Domain’s chaos.

As Luo Tian and his group retreated to the domain’s edge, a figure emerged from the gray mist. Killing intent radiated from him.

“Do you think you can escape this battlefield?” A cold voice echoed. Meng Yongzhi appeared before Luo Tian’s group.

“Meng Yongzhi, you’re bold!” Sun Shengtian glared at Meng Yongzhi, his eyes flashing with coldness.

“Three of us are enough to kill you!” Meng Yongzhi’s hands moved, forming a gray sword. His gaze swept over Luo Tian with intense killing intent—his goal was to kill Luo Tian and claim the Epoch Scripture.

“Let’s team up once,” Luo Tian said, gazing at Meng Yongzhi’s overwhelming aura before addressing Sun Shengtian.

“Do I have a choice? At this point, all grudges must be set aside,” Sun Shengtian’s body radiated golden light, his aura formidable. He stood beside Luo Tian and Diaoyuan Shan.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded inwardly. This Sun Shengtian understood the gravity of the situation, choosing to ally with them instead of provoking conflict.

“Fight!” The three exchanged glances before disappearing from their spot. Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian rushed toward Meng Yongzhi, while Luo Tian’s body glowed with golden light. He brandished the Rupture Spear and charged toward Meng Yongzhi.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram!” Sun Shengtian unleashed his clan’s ultimate technique, the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram, striking Meng Yongzhi.

“Purple Qi from the East, sweeping across three thousand!” Diaoyuan Shan’s aura surged. Purple qi erupted from his hands, engulfing Meng Yongzhi in waves of purple light that crashed toward him.

“Trivial tricks!” Meng Yongzhi’s hands moved, summoning gray seals that transformed into serpents. They pierced through the purple waves toward Diaoyuan Shan.

Meanwhile, a gray seal struck down, colliding with the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram. The collision shattered both techniques, sending wild waves that intensified the purple tides.

“Still have me!” A cold voice echoed in Meng Yongzhi’s ears. Luo Tian broke through the purple waves, appearing beside him. His golden Rupture Spear became a streak of gold, piercing toward Meng Yongzhi.

“You’re not worthy!” Meng Yongzhi calmly struck with his fist, ignoring the spear’s sharp tip. Gray seals covered his fist, clashing against the spear.

The clash erupted with a deafening sound. The Rupture Spear emitted a hum, flying from Luo Tian’s hand into the void.

“Dharma Sealing Demon!” Luo Tian roared, ignoring his spear’s departure. He unleashed the Dharma Sealing Fist, merging it with the梵天 attack to strike Meng Yongzhi.

“Don’t learn your lesson!” Meng Yongzhi sneered, unafraid. Though being close to Luo Tian was troublesome, he wasn’t afraid of his powerful punch.

“Unmoving Meng King!” Meng Yongzhi roared, his body covered in gray seals. His form expanded like a balloon, each seal on his veins radiating explosive power.

“Crack!” A clash of gray and gold fists sent cracks through their contact. Wild waves surged, purple lightning rising within the tides, striking both combatants.

“Smack!” Luo Tian’s body recoiled. His arm felt numb, his expression darkened.

“He’s grown stronger!” Luo Tian inwardly marveled. He had fought Meng Yongzhi before, but now he was repelled—this surprised him.

“Rippling…” Purple dragons surged again. Diaoyuan Shan transformed into a ghostly fox, his speed reaching its peak. He appeared beside Meng Yongzhi, his sharp claws flashing with cold light, slicing into Meng Yongzhi’s body.

On the other side, Sun Shengtian wielded a golden sword. Though not an Epoch treasure, it radiated an aura of the Epoch stage. Clearly, this sword was connected to the Epoch Lord.

“Puff!” A flash of cold light—blood spewed. Meng Yongzhi’s chest and shoulder were pierced, bleeding.

“Effective!” Seeing Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian’s attacks inflict damage, Luo Tian sighed deeply. He realized his gap with a true Epoch beginner was still significant.

“Good, you’ve improved,” Meng Yongzhi’s aura radiated gray mist, healing his wounds. “You two are not to be underestimated. If I hadn’t used the Unmoving Meng King, you might have wounded me.”

Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian appeared, exchanging glances. Both saw the tension in each other’s eyes.

The Four Sacred Star Domains trembled, their vast expanse boiling. No place was untouched; thunderous echoes resounded, even reaching the Nine Domains.

Across the Nine Domains, everyone watched this battle—its outcome determined the fate of all. The deafening sounds were felt even from afar, revealing the battle’s intensity.

“Luo Tian! Don’t die!” In a space opened by the artifact Meng Yunxiao of the Ancient Heaven Palace, two domains’ people watched a flickering soul lamp. This was Luo Tian’s last gift—when the lamp went out, he would die.

Other domains and sacred clans did the same, anxiously watching their elders’ survival symbols.

“Crack!” Luo Tian and his group dodged through the purple sea, their attacks relentless against Meng Yongzhi.

Yet Meng Yongzhi stood like a giant. Though wounded, his injuries were not fatal. More terrifying was his body—no matter how they attacked, it never moved an inch.

“Hum…” Luo Tian, Diaoyuan Shan, and Sun Shengtian appeared atop the purple sea. They exchanged thoughts through their spiritual senses.

“This isn’t working. We’ve been fighting for half a day, but he remains so calm!” Sun Shengtian’s voice echoed in their minds.

“Unexpected. Meng Yongzhi is so strong—single-handedly blocking our three attacks!” Diaoyuan Shan sighed, his aged face showing exhaustion.

“Smack!” As they marveled, another change occurred elsewhere. A Hunhu Domain elder was sliced in half by Meng Xiyan’s palm, dying instantly.

“Damn!” Luo Tian and his group’s faces darkened. The balance had been maintained, but now they’d lost one elder—this could lead to a shocking shift.

“Haha! You can’t even regenerate blood. How dare you challenge us?” The elder who fought Meng Xiyan laughed, his eyes filled with disdain. This was the third of the Nine Sacred Saints—Meng Xiyan.

Meng Xiyan opened his mouth, swallowing the blood mist of the fallen elder. His eyes gleamed with ecstasy.

“Luo Tian, see? You’ll be like this next!” Meng Yongzhi smiled, standing in space.

“His defense is too strong. He must have used the Unmoving Meng King to enhance his body!” Diaoyuan Shan said, recalling that even an early Epoch elder would only suffer light injuries from his attacks.

“Probably. Any technique has a way to break it!” Sun Shengtian said, his face tense as he gazed at Meng Yongzhi. The loss of an elder had instilled a sense of crisis.

“Did you notice? He hasn’t moved at all. He’s either using a technique or fighting close-range with me!” Luo Tian observed Meng Yongzhi, as another gray seal descended upon their heads.

“Smack!” The three合力 shattered the Divine Seal, appearing in a disheveled state. They split into three directions, rushing toward Meng Yongzhi.

The Dharma Sealing Fist swung again. Luo Tian rushed toward Meng Yongzhi, while Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian’s attacks struck him.

“Useless. Even a mid-Epoch elder would need to pay a price to wound me!” Meng Yongzhi stood still, allowing their attacks. He then struck with two fists toward Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian.

“Puff!” Two smacks echoed. As the three attacked Meng Yongzhi, his fists struck Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian.

“Puff!” Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian spat blood, vanishing beside Meng Yongzhi. Luo Tian returned to their side.

“How are you?” Luo Tian’s face bore concern. If this continued, they would be worn down by Meng Yongzhi’s injury-exchange tactics.

“Let him move. If he moves, the technique will fail!” Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian spoke. After several clashes, they had deduced the method to break the Unmoving Meng King.

“Unleash our strongest attack!” Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian exchanged glances. At this critical moment, there was no need for restraint.

“Smack!” As they transmitted their thoughts swiftly, another mid-Epoch elder from the Xingluo Domain fighting Meng Xiyan was also torn apart, becoming blood mist that floated in space.

Luo Tian’s group’s faces darkened again. Previously, three elders fought Meng Xiyan; now only one remained, struggling desperately. Soon, he would also fall—this would add a mid-Epoch elder to the Meng Domain’s forces. One mid-Epoch could shift the entire balance.

In the void, Long Xin Yuan and Sun Yinhang fought desperately. Meng Haoyan’s strength exceeded their expectations, leaving them barely able to hold back.

“Kill!” Seeing their side falling behind, Luo Tian finally grew anxious. He dashed toward Meng Yongzhi.

“Divine Seals!” Sun Shengtian struck first, his hands glowing with holy light. Strange seals emerged, pressing toward Meng Yongzhi.

“Void Shattering Dragon Roar!” Diaoyuan Shan unleashed his power, merging into the void. Thunderous roars echoed as purple qi flowed into it, forming a ghostly fox that roared toward Meng Yongzhi.

Feeling their attacks, Meng Yongzhi’s face changed. Gray mist swirled around him, obscuring his body.

The gray mist clashed with Sun Shengtian’s seals without a sound, as if they annihilated each other. The gray mist vanished.

“Roar!” The ghostly fox roared, biting Meng Yongzhi’s body. Its sharp teeth pierced his flesh.

Meng Yongzhi’s face finally changed. Purple qi seeped into his body through the wound, causing him to tremble—but he still held back.

Luo Tian and his group were correct. The Unmoving Meng King could not leave its hundred-foot range. If it did, the technique would vanish.

Meng Yongzhi knew Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian’s difficulty. He also faced Luo Tian, who was no easy opponent. If he fought directly, he might die. So he had used his ultimate technique from the start.

Meng Yongzhi’s face darkened as Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian’s attacks came again.

Purple waves surged, merging with the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram. They struck Meng Yongzhi again.

The thunderous collision sent Meng Yongzhi spitting blood, his face pale as paper. His body fell repeatedly under the attacks.

But after falling dozens of feet, he stopped, catching his breath. His eyes were dark as he gazed at Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian.

“Still have me!” Luo Tian’s face turned cold. He finally unleashed the Yin Fish Tortoise Armor, activating it to form a black demon sun that fell from the void toward Meng Yongzhi.

“A fragment of an injured Epoch treasure? You think it can harm me?” As Meng Yongzhi steadied himself, he saw the demon sun descending. His face twisted with rage. His arms bulged with veins, gray seals flowing rapidly toward the Yin Fish Tortoise Armor.

“Of course not. But it can!” Luo Tian smiled coldly, his hands emitting golden seals into the armor.

“Rippling…” Light burst forth. Misty qi flowed within the Yin Fish Tortoise Armor, clashing with its appearance but radiating a heavy aura that dimmed the entire space.

“One… ten…” Hundreds of bones poured from the armor. Each was like a mountain, pressing heavily on Meng Yongzhi’s body.

The bones rained down from the sky like a storm of withered bones, sweeping over Meng Yongzhi’s body.

Though Luo Tian couldn’t forge the bones into shapes like the artifact Yin Fish, he could release them. This was his only way to kill Meng Yongzhi.

“You didn’t move? Then you won’t move even in death!” Luo Tian glared at the bones, his face twisted with ferocity.

“Smack! Smack!” The bones struck Meng Yongzhi’s body, instantly annihilating him into droplets of blood that clung to the bones.

“Killed!” Diaoyuan Shan and Sun Shengtian’s faces lit up. Though it was only a mid-Epoch Meng Yongzhi, they had finally eliminated one.

“Divine Heaven’s Nine Heavens!” As the three rejoiced, a deep voice echoed in their ears. Their expressions changed drastically.
