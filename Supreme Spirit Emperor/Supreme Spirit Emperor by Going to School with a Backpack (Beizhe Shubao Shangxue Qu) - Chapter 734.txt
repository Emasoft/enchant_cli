Nine massive petals trembled, radiating an overwhelming aura. They continuously scattered divine light, illuminating the entire hall.

"May I break through to the Immortal King realm in one move!" The Eternal Immortal King opened his eyes, gazing at the colossal Eternal Flower. His gaze revealed anticipation. He could sense the presence of the Eternal Flower, which influenced the laws of existence, freeing him from their constraints. It also provided an endless flow of cultivation power for them to grow.

This was the Eternal Flower's recompense. For generations, the Eternal Mountain had revered the Eternal Flower. As a divine artifact, it offered immense rewards to the Eternal Mountain—boundless!

...

On Mount Buxian, the Buxian Immortal King wore a look of admiration. His gaze turned to the void as he calculated repeatedly. His face bore deep lines, and his aura had weakened considerably.

*Spit!*

Blood spewed from the Buxian Immortal King's mouth, further diminishing his aura. Yet his eyes gleamed with joy.

"This is my final calculation. But it's worth it!" The Buxian Immortal King murmured, his voice echoing through the hall.

"Enter!" The Buxian Immortal King spoke, narrowing his eyes as if ready to close them at any moment.

"Father!"
"Brother!"

As the Buxian Immortal King's words faded, the hall's doors opened. A crowd rushed in—Jiang Yuzhe, several of the Buxian Immortal King's peers, even Ye Sheng and Ye Wudao. Their eyes brimmed with concern.

Ten years ago, the Buxian Immortal King had secluded himself. Everyone knew he was the longest-living Immortal King in the present celestial realm, often sacrificing his life to calculate. Now, his time was near.

Upon entering the hall, Jiang Yuzhe's heart sank—his aura had become too weak.

"Jiang Yuzhe, you shall be the next master of Buxian Mountain. You must support him well!"

"One month later, Buxian Mountain will relocate to the Central Three Heavens, adjacent to Tianyuan Sect. A great upheaval is coming. Only by uniting with Tianyuan Sect can Buxian Mountain endure!" The Buxian Immortal King spoke, his voice still authoritative but leaving the hall's people in disbelief.

"This..."
"Brother, Buxian Mountain has existed for tens of thousands of years in the Upper Three Heavens. We've weathered countless storms. To relocate to the Central Three Heavens, though called an alliance, Tianyuan Sect has deep roots there. It's hard to avoid appearing subordinate!" An elder spoke, his voice laced with doubt.

"This decision is final. The upheaval I speak of is a world-shaking one—perhaps even greater than the ancient cataclysm. If miracles exist, it will be Tianyuan Sect that created them!" The Buxian Immortal King replied firmly.

"Enough. I'm tired... Yuzhe, Ye Wudao, stay!" The Buxian Immortal King spoke. He left only two people: Ye Wudao and Jiang Yuzhe.

"Yes!" Though puzzled, the others dared not defy the Buxian Immortal King's will.

That night at midnight, a roar echoed from Mount Buxian. The great power, the Buxian Immortal King, had perished!

This news spread rapidly across the celestial realm. The entire realm was in uproar, many sighing with sorrow.

"Brother Jiang, may you rest in peace! The burden now falls upon us!"
"Since the fall of Duan Tian, it seems our era has passed!" Several peak Immortal Kings sighed. Even the strongest could not escape aging and death.

The Buxian Immortal King's funeral was exceptionally grand. Nine immortal mountains, even the Ten Palaces of Yama, sent representatives to mourn—purely out of respect for a formidable power.

For one day, both the celestial and hellish realms halted their conflicts. A month after the Buxian Immortal King's passing, Buxian Mountain relocated entirely to the Central Three Heavens. It established itself near Tianyuan Sect, declaring an alliance with it. This news again stirred the celestial realm.

Chapter 2793: Eternal Mountain ()

"Mount Buxian has shown weakness, fearing a fate like Duan Tian's?" The news of Mount Buxian's relocation stirred public attention.

Tianyuan Sect, a name synonymous with legend. Originally formidable, its power grew even greater after allying with Buxian Mountain. The Central Three Heavens were now fully under Tianyuan Sect's control.

Yet, barely a month after Buxian Mountain's affairs settled, another shocking revelation spread across the world.

Eternal Mountain, Eternal Immortal King had achieved a step toward the Immortal Emperor realm!

"This world is about to change!" That day, a solemn voice echoed across Eternal Mountain. It resonated throughout the Upper Three Heavens, shaking all immortal mountains.

Not only that, Eternal Mountain was struck by divine thunderstorms for months. The entire region of millions of miles around the mountain was reduced to ruins.

Three peaks of Immortal King strength emanated from Eternal Mountain, causing the celestial realm to erupt in shock. Eternal Mountain had gained three more Immortal Kings.

"Change is coming!"
"Eternal Mountain has produced so many powerful figures. There's no need to explain what this means—it's a clear intent to unify the Upper Three Heavens!" The entire celestial realm understood. Eternal Mountain's actions would surely reshape the realm's balance.

Peak Immortal King strength was no longer alarming, but a step toward the Immortal Emperor could suppress all. In essence, Eternal Immortal King was the greatest in the celestial realm for ten thousand years—halfway to an Immortal Emperor.

"Friends, I await you all at Eternal Mountain for a discussion on the Dao!" After Eternal Mountain regained calmness, Eternal Immortal King directly extended an invitation to other immortal mountains.

"Discussing the Dao!"
"Discuss your mother's Dao! We don't fear you!" At the Medicine King Mountain, Old Medicine King, known for his fiery temper, stood up and brandished the Shennong Cauldron. However, he was stopped by his mountain's people. Everyone knew Eternal Immortal King had ill intentions.

"Don't go? Do you think that old man would give up so easily? Have you forgotten how Duan Tian Mountain fell?" Medicine King cursed, addressing his subordinates.

Several peak Immortal Kings secretly deliberated. They knew they had to unite to have a chance to converse with Eternal Immortal King.

Except for Mount Xumi, all other peak immortal mountains brought world treasures and arrived at Eternal Mountain alone.

Days later, a battle erupted on Eternal Mountain. Eternal Immortal King, with his invincible might and the Eternal Spear, swept aside several peak immortal kings.

...

On Eternal Mountain, Eternal Immortal King stood there, his aura radiating outward. His presence felt like the heavens themselves pressing down.

Several figures stood there, their postures still upright despite weakened auras—none other than the peak immortal kings of various mountains.

"This is a step toward the Immortal Emperor. Once I become an ultimate Immortal Emperor, I shall attempt to comprehend the mysteries of fate and enter the realm of eternal life!"

"Submit or not submit? Make your decision now!" Eternal Immortal King shouted, gazing at the subdued peak immortal kings.

"From now on, only Eternal Mountain shall exist in the Upper Three Heavens. Who dares oppose me? God, I'll slay him; Buddha, I'll crush him!" Eternal Immortal King's cold voice made the peak immortal kings' faces grim.

"Om!" Just as Eternal Immortal King's words faded, two figures descended from the heavens. Divine light enveloped them as they appeared beneath Eternal Mountain's sky.

One was a monk with an enlightened countenance, the other a divine ape radiating immense power. He wielded a staff inscribed with runes.

"You say 'Buddha, I'll crush him'—what are you? Mount Xumi's bald monk. We haven't come to find you, yet you dare to cause trouble here!" A senior of Eternal Mountain roared, his aura radiating peak Immortal King strength.

*Boom!*

As the senior's words ended, the divine ape struck immediately. His staff expanded violently, pressing down toward the senior.

Eternal Immortal King's eyes narrowed slightly, surprise flickering across them. Yet he extended a finger, and the world trembled.

A green fingertip touched the golden staff. The staff, which had been pressing down on the senior, emitted a violent hum.

"Om!" The elder monk beside the divine ape recited a mantra, raising his hand to unleash a golden palm of immense divine power.

*Boom!*

In an instant, the thunderous sound echoed across the world. Eternal Immortal King's fingertip shattered beneath the golden palm, and a vast expanse of sky collapsed with it.

At the same time, the golden staff did not change direction. It pressed down upon the senior's head with a *crack*.

People could clearly hear the sound of breaking. The senior transformed into a fly-like form, plummeting from the sky and crashing onto Buxian Mountain.

"Shakyamuni, you too..." Eternal Immortal King's face bore shock as he gazed at the elder monk, exclaiming.

"Yes, Eternal Immortal King, your reach is too long. For these nine immortal mountains to have existed for so long, there must be a reason. It's not your place to unify them!" The elder monk spoke softly, his entire body bathed in Buddha light.

"A step toward the Immortal Emperor—only a step toward the Immortal Emperor can stop Eternal Immortal King!" The subdued peak immortal kings' eyes gleamed with joy.

Mount Xumi had always remained indifferent to worldly matters, but it was dedicated to saving all beings. Thus, the peak immortal kings knew they had been rescued; otherwise, they would have no choice but to submit to Eternal Immortal King.

Fear—this was the only word that could describe Eternal Immortal King in their minds. They were peak powers, possessing world treasures, yet after a brief clash, they had been subdued by Eternal Immortal King. It was as if the heavens themselves were against them, and Eternal Immortal King could command any force to attack.

"Haha, Shakyamuni, I'd like to test the depth of your Buddhist culture!" Eternal Immortal King laughed, raising his hand to tear open the sky. The cosmos appeared as he stepped out into the domain beyond.

"Old monk, I'll accompany you. If I win, please let Eternal Immortal King release these friends!" The elder monk clasped his hands in reverence and stepped into the vast cosmos alongside Eternal Immortal King.

"Go!" The divine ape saw the two enter the domain beyond and approached the bound peak immortal kings. His battle spirit surged as he gazed at Eternal Mountain's people, striking repeatedly to break their seals.

"Battle Saint Buddha, you think it's so easy to leave?" Seeing the Demon Emperor Tian wanted to take a few people away, Eternal Mountain's people would not let him succeed. Two peak immortals stood before Demon Emperor Tian.

"Only you?" Demon Emperor Tian's face bore disdain as his battle spirit surged. He brandished his staff and charged the two peak immortals.

That day, the heavens of the celestial realm roared endlessly. The battle lasted three days before finally calming. Three days later, each peak immortal king returned to their respective mountains.

Mount Xumi's great power also entered the step toward the Immortal Emperor, battling Eternal Immortal King for three days and nights. Who won remained unknown, but Eternal Mountain no longer boasted as before.

At the same time, news of Mount Xumi's Buddha Master entering the step toward the Immortal Emperor spread.

Chapter 2794: The Upheaval Begins ()

The celestial realm suddenly had two figures on the brink of becoming Immortal Emperors. This made the hellish realms feel a great sense of crisis. If the celestial realm's forces attacked hell, in this era without an Immortal Emperor, two figures on the brink could suppress everything. Instantly, the situation became tense again.

However, the most panicked were those in the Central Three Heavens. Since the celestial realm would attack hell, it inevitably passed through the Central Three Heavens. How could they not take the opportunity to destroy Tianyuan Sect and reclaim control of the Central Three Heavens?

"Finally, a few decades of peace. Now it's about to start again!"
"Not bad at all. I think things are better now than during the era of a hundred sects vying for dominance!" The people of the Central Three Heavens sighed. During Tianyuan Sect's rule over the Central Three Heavens, it was beloved by all cities. Rules were established, and certain things were strictly prohibited.

Time passed, and another message arrived: several peak immortal kings were summoned to Eternal Mountain again. After three days, they returned to their respective mountains.

An alliance of eight immortal mountains was formed, with Eternal Immortal King as its leader to attack hell. This news spread like wildfire, causing a stir. Though called an alliance, everyone knew it was a disguised acknowledgment of Eternal Mountain's supremacy. From now on, many matters would be decided by Eternal Mountain.

"If Tianyuan Sect submits, I'll show mercy and grant them a path to survival. Otherwise, I will annihilate Tianyuan Sect!" After becoming the alliance's leader, Eternal Immortal King issued his first command.

"Three days to consider. If you submit and obey the commands of the nine immortal mountains, you'll become our vanguard to attack hell, seizing cities and lands!" Eternal Immortal King's words reached Tianyuan Sect.

"We can acknowledge you as the alliance leader and allow your forces to pass, but submission is impossible!" Tianyuan Sect responded defiantly.

"This is bold! Don't they know what they're facing? That's a step toward the Immortal Emperor!" The celestial realm was in uproar. No one expected Tianyuan Sect to be so strong against the alliance of several immortal mountains at their peak.

"Indeed, Tianyuan Sect was founded millions of years after the other immortal mountains, but it has warriors capable of defeating peak immortal kings."
"Still, that's a step toward the Immortal Emperor!" Everyone was discussing Tianyuan Sect and the Upper Three Heavens.

"Destroy them!" Without waiting days, Eternal Immortal King responded with even more strength, saying only two words.

Though only two words, everyone could feel they were forged from the blood of millions of lives. They represented the collision of two supreme forces, accompanied by mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

"Regroup! All forces under Tianyuan Sect must retreat!" The current sect master of Tianyuan Sect issued orders, sending commands to all disciples.

At the same time, the celestial realm's forces began gathering under Eternal Mountain. Mount Xumi did not participate.

...

In the Yellow Heaven Palace of Hell, Yang Huanyu sat there, his black robe draped over him. His eyes were deep and enigmatic, leaving the strong below unsure of what he was thinking.

Yang Huanyu lightly adjusted the intelligence passed to him by his subordinates, fingers rhythmically tapping on the table.

"Speak up. What are your opinions?" Yang Huanyu asked, gazing at the crowd.

Strong as a storm!

At this moment, Luoshengmen could only be described in four words—too many strong individuals. Though the previous attack on Pingdeng Palace had wounded Luoshengmen, after recovery, it had captured three hellish palaces and reached a terrifying level.

"Decades of rest have given us the strength to destroy any faction!" An elder spoke, his aura radiating an aged presence.

"Still, everything depends on the Lord's plan. After all, these celestial realm forces are trivial. Luoshengmen's grand scheme must not fail!" Another elder spoke, his aura equally formidable.

"First, we need to seize control of hell. We're missing only the Wheel Palace and Fenyu Palace, as well as Yingshen Palace. The other palaces have already declared submission to us!" Yang Huanyu nodded slightly.

"Start with Fenyu Palace. I'll lead the attack myself. I estimate Ye Fengyu's strength has reached a step toward the Immortal Emperor. However, Fenyu Palace hasn't leaked any information. As for these celestial realm wastes, they won't cause much trouble. I doubt they can even pass Lo Tian's checkpoint!" Yang Huanyu spoke softly.

"Lord, Lo Tian hasn't been heard from in decades. Do you think he'll appear this time with Tianyuan Sect's crisis?" Hearing Yang Huanyu mention Lo Tian, Luoshengmen's people remembered Lo Tian.

Decades of time had seen the emergence of countless strong individuals, making many forget about Lo Tian, a formidable power.

"I don't know if he'll appear, but his current strength is definitely not weak. He should be able to deal with these celestial realm wastes easily!"

"We haven't met in a long time. When we do, it'll be the true battle!" Yang Huanyu spoke softly, his eyes gleaming with light.

Time passed slowly. Three months had gone by without any signs. In the Upper Three Heavens, millions of people appeared in the Central Three Heavens, beginning to attack its cities. Any that refused submission were brutally cleansed.

And it seemed they had planned this together. Hell also began its cleansing, with the long-dormant Luoshengmen revealing its fangs again. Compared to decades ago, it was even sharper. Its first target was the First Palace of Yama's Ten Palaces—Fenyu Palace.

The upheaval had begun!

Everyone was stunned, then terrified. The age of turmoil had arrived, where survival was uncertain. Ultimately, it would be the people who suffered most.

Moreover, everyone could see that Luoshengmen and the celestial realm's immortal mountain alliance both aimed to eliminate internal threats before their final showdown.

However, Tianyuan Sect and Fenyu Palace were both tough bones to chew; no one could deny that. Even if they were devoured, it would cost two teeth.

...

In the depths of the Ghost Swamp, on a black mountain, two figures sat there—one tangible, one intangible.

"Forty years have passed. You spent thirty years passing the trials of Ghost Valley and then played ten years of chess with me. Time was just right. It's time for you to leave!" The black shadow spoke, his eyes filled with amusement as he gazed at Luotian sitting across the chessboard.

"As a piece, one shouldn't aim to defeat the opponent but to break free from the board and become the player!" Luotian spoke, his gaze respectful toward the elder.

Ten years ago, Luotian had fought through battles and reached the summit, seeing this shadow. He recognized the elder as Guigu Zi.

Forty years of battle had finally brought Luotian to a step toward the Immortal Emperor. These ten years, he had played chess with Guigu Zi's shadow, and today was the first time he won.

Yet these ten years had taught him much. He understood many truths and principles, things that couldn't be mastered through cultivation alone.

"A piece trying to break free from the board is too difficult. Throughout history, many have tried to escape this board but were eventually devoured by the player who controlled them. Some were discarded once they lost their value!"

"Among these, I too was included. However, I was the closest to becoming the player. The cost of this was heavy. It was composed of the experiences of generations of Immortal Emperors!" Guigu Zi spoke, his voice not loud but causing Luotian's heart to tremble.

The world was the board, all beings were pieces, and fate was the mind that controlled them. One must not let it collapse because once it does, both the board and pieces might be discarded for new ones.

"Even an Immortal Emperor can't escape this board?" Luotian replied, gazing at Guigu Zi.

"If one could escape, the current world wouldn't have Immortal Kings as its peak. I might still be alive!" Guigu Zi spoke, closing his golden book and handing it to Luotian.

"This book is not complete! It's almost there. If you can comprehend it thoroughly, perhaps you can break free from the board!"

"If you can't comprehend it, then you'll remain a piece. Once this game ends, the board will be rearranged!" Guigu Zi spoke again, causing Luotian to startle.

"I'm still far from it..." Luotian sighed, feeling the state of his dantian.

This journey through the Ghost Swamp had greatly enhanced Luotian's strength, bringing him to a step toward the Immortal Emperor. His dantian now bore an image of the Emperor's Seal, which could become solid if he managed to refine it. Then, he might become an ultimate Immortal Emperor.

An Immortal Emperor was an invincible presence in this world where rules had changed, but even he could not escape beyond the heavens and three thousand small worlds. To break free from this board created by the heavens, as Guigu Zi said, was still insufficient.

"Don't be discouraged. Once you become an Immortal Emperor, you'll have the power to shake the heavens. This is why there are no Immortal Emperors now. It's also the reason for the ancient destruction—because the player wouldn't allow anything to escape and replace him!" Guigu Zi spoke, causing Luotian's mind to tremble.

After his conversation with Guigu Zi, Luotian had understood many mysteries.

In ancient times, emperors vied for dominance, but Immortal Emperors could shake the heavens and challenge fate's will. They even posed a threat to fate itself.

Any existence that threatened fate's will would naturally not be allowed to develop, hence the ancient destruction.

That was when many Immortal Emperors fought against fate's will, and in the end, they were destroyed by it.

"That battle saw royal blood ignite the blue sky, but in the end, they couldn't defy fate. All Immortal Emperors perished, and fate's will was also severely wounded!"

"I too emerged after that battle. I became an Immortal Emperor, intending to replace fate's will while it was wounded!"

"But I never grasped the opportunity. Fate is immortal and unyielding, and I died under its will. That was the most promising chance I had, but I failed to seize it!" Guigu Zi sighed, causing Luotian's mind to conjure images of countless superpowers battling fate.

"Fate's will truly exists!" Luotian marveled, having always thought it was an abstract concept. He believed in human determination and that everything needed to be fought for.

"After that battle, I perished, but I could feel fate's will had weakened further. It was this time that made fate sense a threat, which is why for these years, people could only reach the peak of Immortal Kings!"

"Boy, gather my Guigu Seal and master the art of controlling fate. Most importantly, comprehend this book in your hands—it's the key!" Guigu Zi's figure gradually faded. The chessboard before him also disappeared.

"Respectfully bid farewell, Master!" Luotian clasped his hands in reverence, gazing at Guigu Zi disappearing from the mountain's peak.

As Guigu Zi vanished, the black mountain beneath Luotian also collapsed with a roar. Waves of energy surged from the dust, revealing a black battlefield suspended before Luotian.

"Killing Battlefield!" Luotian gazed at the black battlefield, instantly recognizing its name.

"Ah, Guigu Zi's shadow was also the final test!"

"If I don't pass, this Killing Battlefield won't acknowledge me as its master!" Luotian murmured. He extended his hand, and the black battlefield—radiating fierce killing power—shrank and landed in his palm.

Though Luotian was delighted, his heart felt heavy because of Guigu Zi's words. The calamity was approaching; even an Immortal Emperor might not escape it. This time, the enemy wasn't human or another race but fate itself.

Luotian flipped through the golden纪元 book, but he couldn't see any characters on it. After pondering for a while without success, he sighed and closed the book, storing it away.

Now Luotian was a step toward the Immortal Emperor. The纪元 book no longer felt so difficult to control for him, and he could even use it to suppress enemies.

"Killing Battlefield,纪元 book—possessing these two treasures, I have no real rivals as a step toward the Immortal Emperor!" Luotian's eyes gleamed with confidence. He soared into the sky, rushing toward the direction of Shenyin Village.

Within a quarter of an hour, Luotian returned to Shenyin Village and saw the massive statue with Da Niu and Er Niu still seated atop it. However, those two golden whirlwinds had dimmed considerably.

"This Xuantian Daoist isn't simple. He was a being who fought against fate before Guigu Zi, and his strength was even greater than Guigu Zi's. After all, Guigu Zi took advantage of fate's weakest moment!" Luotian spoke softly, clearly feeling the two's strength had grown to a terrifying level.

Luotian didn't leave but sat cross-legged, guarding Da Niu and Er Niu while waiting for them to awaken. He also took out the纪元 book, continuing his contemplation, hoping to comprehend it thoroughly.

Time passed slowly. Half a year had gone by. The statue's energy remained calm, and Da Niu and Er Niu slowly opened their eyes. As they did, the statue of Xuantian Daoist seemed to be revived by something, as if it had opened its eyes.

A shocking aura spread from the statue of Xuantian Daoist, sweeping across all directions. Even Luotian felt like he wanted to kneel.

The aura vanished instantly, and Da Niu and Er Niu stood up, descending from the statue. They landed beside Luotian. Their eyes had changed, and their auras had reached the step toward the Immortal Emperor, leaving Luotian in awe at Xuantian Daoist's inheritance. A single inheritance had produced two steps toward the Immortal Emperor.

Chapter 2796: The Great Upheaval ()

A blood-soaked era. Hell and the celestial realm, led by two major forces, launched a campaign. The celestial realm and hell were filled with blood, cities destroyed, the world saturated with the scent of blood.

Half a year ago, the celestial alliance had descended into the Central Three Heavens, led by the step toward the Immortal Emperor, Eternal Immortal King. They swept everything aside. Though not an Immortal Emperor, they wielded the might of one. Within three months, they had reached Tianyuan Sect.

Blood dyed the earth and sky. Blood rain continuously fell, surrounding Tianyuan Sect with millions of people shouting for battle.

Eternal Immortal King stood in the sky, gazing at Tianyuan Sect with a cold expression. His side was flanked by several strong individuals, all peak Immortal Kings.

"Three months have passed. Tianyuan Sect is indeed tenacious!" Eternal Immortal King spoke, observing the battlefield like a meat grinder.

Uniting the strength of nine immortal mountains to besiege Tianyuan Sect, they had attacked for three months. Both sides suffered losses. The nine immortal mountains had launched several attacks but still hadn't captured Tianyuan Sect.

Both sides lost millions, yet the nine immortal mountains had still failed to capture Tianyuan Sect. This enraged Eternal Immortal King.

"A mere Tianyuan Sect, yet I must personally intervene!" Eternal Immortal King sneered, his voice laced with dissatisfaction.

"Medicine King, Soul King, Ghost King—three of you, attack and end this battle. I want to see if Tianyuan Sect can produce any more surprises, even Lo Tian!" Eternal Immortal King spoke.

The three peak immortals at his side trembled, their faces filled with bitterness but they took flight toward the battlefield.

"Peak immortals have appeared!" Seeing them depart, Tianyuan Sect's people gasped.

"Just three peak immortals! You're underestimating us Tianyuan Sect!" But Eternal Immortal King's words reached Tianyuan Sect.

"However, Eternal Immortal King is too strong!" Cao Dede's face darkened. Over the years, they had made progress. They could withstand peak immortals but a step toward the Immortal Emperor—just one—could sweep Tianyuan Sect.

"Hope Ziping Brother brings back some strong individuals! Otherwise, we'll have to retreat entirely. All strategies are useless against absolute strength!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, his voice laced with helplessness.

Jiang Nanxuan was indeed intelligent. In just decades, he had unified the Central Three Heavens under Tianyuan Sect and managed it well. Even against peak immortals, they had a chance. But a step toward the Immortal Emperor was something Jiang Nanxuan hadn't anticipated.

"Ultimately, I underestimated the depth of nine immortal mountains!" Jiang Nanxuan sighed. He had calculated everything but never expected Eternal Immortal King to become a step toward the Immortal Emperor.

"I'll check!" Yao Chen's body radiated golden light, brandishing his staff and rushing out. His aura was overwhelming, clearly peak immortal king strength.

"I'll go too!" Chen Zhanbiao's eyes flashed with ferocity, his aura also radiating peak immortal king strength. He brandished a hammer and followed Yao Chen.

"At least wait for Brother Lo to return!" Long Jie roared, transforming into his true form—a three-thousand-zhang golden dragon that coiled upward.

Yao Chen, Chen Zhanbiao, and Long Jie rushed out, their auras overwhelming. Three peak immortals—this was Tianyuan Sect's greatest strength.

In decades, they had broken free from their constraints and become peak immortals!

Powerful blood auras radiated from the three, instantly clashing with the celestial realm's three peak immortals.

"Strong!" Facing Long Jie and his two companions, the Ghost King, Soul King, and Medicine King's eyes narrowed slightly. They hadn't expected Tianyuan Sect to produce three peak immortals at once.

*Boom!*

Six figures collided instantly, their overwhelming waves spreading from the sky's peak.

"Shennong Cauldron!" Medicine King raised his hand, a massive cauldron hovering above him. Green light radiated from it, enveloping Medicine King and protecting himself. His hands formed complex seals, launching powerful attacks toward Yao Chen.

The staff continuously swept across the sky, shaking it. Yao Chen's aura surged as he deflected Medicine King's attacks and retaliated. However, he couldn't break through Medicine King's protection.

Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao faced the same situation. Though they were peak immortals, their opponents possessed world treasures and thus stood invincible.

"Though you're strong, this era isn't yours!" The three peak immortals roared, using their supreme techniques to crush Long Jie and his companions.

"We don't have world treasures!" Cao Dede's group watched as Yao Chen and his companions were subdued, their eyes filled with anxiety.

"You three—go too! I want to see who can stop me!" Eternal Immortal King's brow furrowed slightly, addressing the three peak immortals of Eternal Mountain.

"Yes!" Their faces bore grimaces as they took flight, their peak immortal king auras exploding toward Tianyuan Sect. The remaining people of Tianyuan Sect were no match for them.

"Did you think we had no one?" Tianyuan Sect's side refused to back down, sending out several figures—Cao Dede, Sun Kemin, and Nan Gong Yuqing. Though they were peak immortal kings at the later stage, they still rushed out.

"More than ten peak immortal kings!" Seeing Nan Gong Yuqing and others emerge, the celestial realm's people gasped. Tianyuan Sect had so many peak immortal kings at the later stage.

"Such a short time, three peak immortals and ten later-stage peak immortal kings have emerged!"
"If given more time, Tianyuan Sect would truly turn the world upside down!" People marveled at how four to five people formed a group, attacking the three peak immortals of Eternal Mountain.

The situation briefly balanced but tilted toward the celestial alliance with the addition of peak immortals.

Eternal Immortal King's brow furrowed tightly. He hadn't wanted this outcome. He had aimed for a sweeping victory, but now it seemed he would have to intervene himself to fully subdue Tianyuan Sect.

Throughout the world, all factions watched this battle, with news constantly spreading to various forces.

... At Mount Xumi, Demon Emperor Tian's eyes bore anxiety as he gazed at the Buddha seated there. "When will we act? Must we let the celestial realm fight among itself?"

"It's not yet time. Tianyuan Sect can withstand it!" The Buddha spoke softly, gazing into the void.

Demon Emperor Tian watched the Buddha's calm demeanor and listened to reports, his teeth gritting in frustration.

On another front, outside the Wheel Palace of Hell, a scene similar to Tianyuan Sect's unfolded. Figures in black robes continuously attacked the Wheel Palace—this was Luoshengmen.

"Black and White Death, you still refuse to submit? Now only the Wheel Palace remains. If you don't submit, Ye Fengyu will be your fate!" The Yellow Heaven Palace's master roared, brandishing a head in his hand. The head's owner was Ye Fengyu, the master of Fenyu Palace!

Above the Wheel Palace, Black and White Death radiated immense power, their hands constantly forming seals to suppress all directions.

Chapter 2797: The Heaven Dao Sect ()

"Yama's Ten Palaces have seven submitted to Luoshengmen!"
"Fenyu Palace resisted Luoshengmen and was completely annihilated. Fenyu Palace was wiped out entirely!"
"Now, only the Wheel Palace remains to struggle. Its destruction is just a matter of time!" Compared to the celestial realm, hell was also chaotic but everyone discussed this major event.

Compared to Tianyuan Sect, hell's Luoshengmen was more legendary—suddenly emerging and becoming the first major force in hell. Now it might even become the sole power in hell.

Luotian, Da Niu, and Er Niu flew beneath the sky. Almost immediately after leaving the Ghost Swamp, they heard the news:

"Da Niu, Er Niu, you two go to the Wheel Palace. Make sure it's protected and take its people to Tianyuan Sect!"

"I need to go to Tianyuan Sect!" Luotian instructed Da Niu and Er Niu. They hadn't just received news of the Wheel Palace being besieged but also of the celestial alliance attacking Tianyuan Sect.

"Good!" Da Niu and Er Niu nodded, their speed fast enough to break the sky, producing a爆音.

"Eternal Immortal King, it's time for an end!"
"Brothers, hold on!" Luotian's heart was anxious. He pushed his speed to the limit and rushed toward Buxian City.
