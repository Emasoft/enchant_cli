“Enough chatter. To enter my Nether Domain is to seek death!” A voice as cold as ice echoed, causing Zhu Dezhi, the man bearing a gray banner, to display a flicker of ecstatic madness.

“Third Elder, Eighth Elder, come quickly! This youth is most peculiar; even I nearly fell for his trick!” Zhu Dezhi bellowed, sensing the sound of虚空 being shattered behind him. His eyes gleamed with amusement as he gazed at Luotian.

“Young man, now you truly cannot flee!” Zhu Dezhi laughed arrogantly.

Luotian’s expression of solemnity flickered briefly, as two forces no less formidable than the middle-aged man’s faction materialized within his perception.

“Ultimately, reinforcements have arrived!” Luotian sighed softly in his heart, already knowing who had come to aid Zhu Dezhi.

The Lord of the Third Great Continent of the Nether Domain, Lou Hongseng, ranked among the top three in strength within the Nine Lords. Another was Shen Xinghui, Lord of the Eighth Great Continent, whose strength reached the Transcendent Realm. Though slightly inferior to Meng Guangxiu and Zhu Dezhi, the thought of two reinforcements made Luotian’s lips curl in bitterness.

Yet at this moment, Luotian was like an arrow on a bowstring—forced to delay time, for if he failed, not only would he perish but Jiang Sxi and Nan Gong Yuqing as well.

“Fifth Strike!” Luotian stood beneath the void, his long hair swirling as a black vortex within him spun wildly, as if burning all of Luotian’s potential. The swirling darkness coalesced again into a black mist, flowing into the Demon Blade.

The blade’s radiance roared forth, shattering countless stars and striking the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum.

This strike was Luotian’s peak, yet he knew it would leave no Transcendent Realm being alive. However, against the colorful torrent of energy that surged toward him, there was no chance of survival.

As Luotian raised the Demon Blade, the forces from the other two great continents arrived instantly. Sensing Luotian’s overwhelming aura, both factions displayed shock.

“Third Elder, do you think this youth surpasses even you?” Shen Xinghui asked, his gaze on Lou Hongseng who had accompanied him.

“Indeed. I sense a grave danger from this youth—such a feeling I’ve only known from the Elder.” Lou Hongseng’s face bore deep concern. “You fell to his hands, and it was not unjust. I never expected the Four Sacred Star Domains would produce such a figure. Could it be that the Tianyuan Continent is about to awaken again?”

“Enough chatter! The priority now is to kill this youth, or we’ll have endless troubles!” Zhu Dezhi, bearing the gray banner, displayed a hint of anxiety as he watched Luotian strike the Xuan Feather Drum with his terrifying Demon Blade.

“Indeed, too long a night brings more dreams. Let us kill this youth first!” Lou Hongseng spoke, not daring to be careless, and immediately unleashed a Sacred Artifact.

“Ugh…” A mournful sound echoed as a brown, unassuming clay jar was conjured by the middle-aged man. From it flowed endless radiance, forming golden serpents that coalesced into a single torrent.

Shen Xinghui also smiled, gripping a gray whip and gently flicking it in the void.

One flick sent it through space, summoning thunderous serpents that roared with fury.

The gray banner flapped in the wind, and a terrifying storm surged beneath it. Zhu Dezhi, wounded by Luotian earlier, wore an expression of satisfaction.

“Young man, I don’t believe you’ll still be alive!” The middle-aged man bellowed, his voice brimming with arrogance.

“Roar…” Nearly three million Supreme Realm cultivators behind the three let out a cry, their primordial energies coalescing into another torrent.

With three Transcendent Lords and two to three million Supreme Realm cultivators, even a Transcendent Realm being had no chance of survival.

Before the terrifying energy fully converged, an overwhelming pressure immediately pressed upon Luotian’s body, causing his black Demon Blade to hesitate.

“Unresistable!” Luotian felt his entire body as if no longer his own, and his limbs began to disobey.

“Open!” Luotian roared, knowing that if he did not strike this blow now, there would never be another chance.

…

Chapter 858: How to Escape?

Amidst the endless stars, a colossal surge of power—three Transcendent Lords’ Sacred Artifacts and two to three million Supreme Realm cultivators’ combined might—coalesced into a multicolored torrent, rushing toward Luotian.

Luotian wielded the Demon Blade, its massive radiance shattering space and severing stars as it slashed toward the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum.

This was Luotian’s ultimate strike, yet he knew it would leave no Transcendent Realm being alive.

But against the terrifying pressure of the multicolored torrent, there was no chance of survival.

Resisting the unbearable pressure, Luotian trembled as he slashed his black radiance onto the Xuan Feather Drum’s surface.

The thunderous roar echoed, and a black dragon surged forth from Luotian’s strike, shaking the red drum surface. The drum appeared unable to withstand it, developing countless fine cracks.

“Roar…” The black dragon surged forward with unyielding momentum, colliding with the multicolored torrent. In Luotian’s weakened gaze, they clashed.

The two dragons continuously devoured each other, black whirlwinds spreading around their energies, drawing in everyone’s souls with immense suction.

“Boom…” A terrifying explosion erupted, sweeping every corner of the stars, causing some Supreme Realm disciples of the Nether Domain to feel their minds ringing.

The first great continent of the Nether Domain emitted a series of brittle sounds, as if on the verge of collapse.

As Nan Gong Yuqing and Jiang Sxi flew desperately, they heard the thunderous roar behind them. Their faces bore a bitter expression.

“Luotian!” Jiang Sxi’s eyes welled with tears, gazing at the explosion that seemed to stretch across millions of miles. Her heart felt hollow; she could not imagine who could survive such an explosion.

“Don’t worry, Luotian isn’t a man of short life. Our priority now is to escape!” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled faintly, comforting Jiang Sxi.

Yet Nan Gong Yuqing’s heart drummed with fear; he could feel the terrifying power of that surge. Even a Transcendent Realm cultivator would find it impossible to survive.

“Alas… I’ll avenge you, and when my cultivation improves, I’ll flatten the Nether Domain!” Nan Gong Yuqing vowed silently, then shouted at everyone.

“Look what you’re staring at! Move faster! Luotian is risking his life to help us escape. Now, all of you, give it your all! Did you hear me!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s voice rang out.

He and Jiang Sxi surged forward, their speed increasing another level as they flew toward the golden gate-like entrance.

Hearing Nan Gong Yuqing’s roar, everyone felt a slight stir in their hearts, their eyes darkening with resolve. They gazed deeply at the Nether Domain before transforming into streaks of light, flying toward the Book of Epochs.

Luotian wore a bitter smile; he could feel his superhuman energy had been drained to the point of being unable to move.

Though the black dragon was terrifying, it was still inferior to the Nether Domain’s attack and only lasted a few seconds before being completely submerged.

Yet it was Luotian’s final strike, and it had blocked five-tenths of the Nether Domain’s attack.

Luotian stood still, not dodging—not because he didn’t want to, but because his body had been drained and the pressure of the multicolored dragon was too strong.

Fortunately, his earlier defense had sent out a terrifying surge of power. Using that, he forced himself back several tens of thousands of feet.

“Young man, now you’re truly dead!” Zhu Dezhi, holding the gray banner, wore a sinister expression as he awaited Luotian’s demise.

“Everyone, prepare to chase the remaining escapees. If we can’t catch them, we’ll kill our way out of the Nether Domain and massacre the entire Four Sacred Star Domains!” The Third Elder spoke with authority, his gaze on the distant golden Book of Epochs.

“I cannot die!” Luotian’s pale face bore a fierce will to live, and his potential was awakened. A stream of black superhuman energy flowed through him, turning his body into a series of blue hues.

“Roar…” A dragon’s roar echoed from Luotian’s body, causing the three Nether Domain Transcendent Lords to glance at each other.

“Tenacious youth, your body is special! But it’s useless!” Shen Xinghui, the Eighth Elder, sneered at Luotian’s body shrouded in blue mist.

“Boom…” Under the Nether Domain disciples’ gaze, the multicolored dragon finally struck Luotian’s body, causing his figure to vanish from sight.

Luotian’s face was grim; he knew that even if he didn’t die, it would be near.

“Spit…!” Blood erupted as the wild energy pushed Luotian a hundred miles away, forming a colorful path.

His entire body emitted crackling sounds, feeling as if he had been flayed, and he was severely wounded.

“I cannot die!” The intense pain kept Luotian alert; his eyelids were heavy, but he constantly thought of how to escape the Nether Domain.

After half a moment, the multicolored dragon finally dissipated, and Luotian’s figure was invisible to the eye.

“Cough… cough…” In the gray stars, Luotian was at his weakest; his will to survive kept him barely conscious. His eyes stared intently at the somewhat blurred Book of Epochs.

“Escape… I must escape…” Luotian forced a step forward, and his entire body vanished from the spot, flying toward the Book of Epochs.

“Damn it! This level of attack and this youth still lives? What is he made of!” The Nether Domain disciples’ faces darkened as they watched Luotian flying toward the Book of Epochs from ten thousand miles away, murmuring in astonishment.

“This youth is already at his limit; his speed isn’t even as fast as a nine-source Supreme Realm cultivator. Kill him!” Zhu Dezhi, holding the gray banner, displayed a cold killing intent and rushed toward Luotian.

Lou Hongseng and Shen Xinghui, seeing this, their eyes flashed with light: “Elder Sixth, I’ll help you!”

After speaking, they transformed into two streaks of light and rushed toward Luotian. Lou Hongseng and Shen Xinghui knew well that the youth was severely wounded, and even an eight-source Transcendent Realm cultivator could kill him. Why would Elder Third fight him? It was clear that Elder Third had his eyes on the Sacred Artifact in Luotian’s hands.

Seeing three Lords rushing toward Luotian, their subordinates dared not delay and let out a low roar before following them.

Yet Luotian seemed to ignore them, his eyes only on the golden gate and the figure outside it.

“Go ahead; if he escapes, he’ll come out eventually!” Nan Gong Yuqing said to Jiang Sxi, gently shaking his head.

At this time, the others who had entered the Nether Domain had already exited the Book of Epochs. Only Jiang Sxi refused to leave, waiting here for Luotian. Nan Gong Yuqing had no choice but to stay with her.

“One thousand miles…” Luotian felt he was only one thousand miles away from the Book of Epochs. In the past, it would take him half a moment to arrive, but now it felt like an insurmountable chasm.

“Young man, injured like this and still escaping so fast!” Zhu Dezhi, Lou Hongseng, and Shen Xinghui’s mocking voices echoed behind Luotian, causing his eyes to flash with resolve.

At this moment, he could even see Jiang Sxi and Nan Gong Yuqing outside the Book of Epochs, their faces softening: “Sxi, take care of our child!”

“Cough… cough…” Jiang Sxi softly coughed, a strange tightness in her heart. A sharp pain surged from her abdomen, intensifying her bad premonition.

“Luotian…” As Jiang Sxi felt heartbroken, Nan Gong Yuqing’s eyes widened in shock; he had seen Luotian flying toward them and the three Nether Domain Lords, along with two to three million Supreme Realm disciples.

“This…” Nan Gong Yuqing opened his mouth but could not speak, even after enduring countless hardships. His heart trembled.

Three Transcendent Lords and two to three million Supreme Realm disciples—just the aura was enough to move anyone.

As Nan Gong Yuqing was stunned, Jiang Sxi’s face bore a determined look and vanished before his eyes.

“Take her away, hurry!” Stunned, Luotian’s weak voice echoed in Nan Gong Yuqing’s mind, causing his body to tremble and a look of urgency on his face.

“Young man, how do you escape?” The three Lords again unleashed their Sacred Artifacts, forming terrifying attacks that swept toward Luotian.

“No…” Jiang Sxi, eyes filled with tears, watched as Luotian was tens of thousands of feet away and cried out.

…

Chapter 860: Escape

Under the stars, Luotian wore a bitter smile as he awaited the finger of the Nether Domain elder’s attack.

Luotian knew this finger was not aimed at him but to kill the powerful presence within the Book of Epochs. He was merely a gift.

“This time, you’ll finally die!” Lou Hongseng and the others wore expressions of relief. They never expected a small Luotian to provoke the elder.

“Alas…” A long sigh echoed in people’s ears, as if it had crossed ages from ancient times. The voice carried a hint of helplessness.

As the sigh ended, the elder’s finger shadow shattered with a thunderous explosion, turning into swirling dust that drifted through heaven and earth. People’s faces showed fear.

“What terrifying presence is inside this Book of Epochs? My heavens, it even blocked the elder’s attack!” Zhu Dezhi, Lou Hongseng, and Shen Xinghui were stunned.

The Nether Domain’s Nine Elders were considered invincible in Zhu Dezhi and others’ eyes. No one could match the Nine Elders of the Nether Domain.

But today, their invincible elder had been stopped by a sigh. This was enough to shock them.

“Unexpectedly, your strength has recovered so much!” The elder’s attack was blocked, but he showed no surprise.

“You block my path? Let me go!” The Book of Epochs echoed with a sigh.

“Ah, you value this youth?” The elder smiled, gazing at Luotian who was about to enter the Book of Epochs. He was only a few feet away from exiting the Nether Domain.

Luotian’s face lit up with excitement; a few feet, within one breath, he would arrive. With the strange force pushing him, he could instantly reach it.

But wishes were beautiful; reality was cruel. The elder’s finger extended again, sending out a strange fluctuation. Time seemed to reverse, and Luotian’s body was instantly transported tens of miles away from the Book of Epochs.

“Damn it, do you have to play with me like this!” Luotian wanted to curse but lacked the strength even to speak.

“You want him alive, I’ll let him die!” The elder’s face smiled, his tranquil aura turning fierce. It was like a calm sea suddenly hit by a tsunami.

A gray hand slowly formed, carrying the will of heaven and earth, rushing toward Luotian. The elder’s cold voice echoed: “Though I don’t know what this youth means to you, he must be extraordinary to make you risk exposure to save him!”

As he spoke, the gray hand shattered vast stars and appeared before Luotian. The pressure made it hard for him to breathe.

“Again, this feeling—feeling of life and death in another’s hands!” Luotian stared at the elder, memorizing his appearance.

“I, Luotian, swear today: if I don’t die, I will flatten the Nether Domain!” Luotian’s eyes were resolute. He didn’t know where he got the strength, but he roared it out.

“Hmph…” The elder shook his head lightly. In these endless years, he had killed countless people; this kind of speech was common and didn’t touch him.

“Good!” A voice of approval echoed from the Book of Epochs, and a golden hand flew out, forming a streak of gold. Its terrifying power was no less than the elder’s gray hand.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed, and two hands—gray and golden—collided. The fluctuation spread again, causing many Nether Domain disciples to die.

The entire starry sky became a vacuum within a hundred miles, dark and silent.

This time was different from before; Luotian wasn’t protected by the Book of Epochs. He was caught between two Transcendent Lords’ attacks, and his body turned into a mist of blood, as if annihilated.

“Hmph…” The elder sneered, his eyes cold. He was about to move when a mournful laugh echoed in his ears, causing him to pause and his eyes to flicker with panic.

“Can you strike again? This child is already dead. Are you sure you can block me?” Before the Nether Domain elder could speak, a沧桑 voice echoed again. The elder stopped moving.

In the Nether Domain disciples’ eyes, the elder looked even more aged. His wrinkles deepened after clashing with the terrifying presence in the Book of Epochs, as if he were an old man on the brink of death.

The elder pondered for a moment, sighing inwardly: “The blood energy of the first Nether Domain can only allow me to strike twice. If I push further, it would drain my life essence, and killing this youth is not worth it!”

“Fine. Today I’ll grant you a favor. I know that with your presence, this youth is not dead. Though I don’t know what he means to you, your current state can’t protect him for long. When we nine revive, it will be your end!” The Nether Domain elder looked at the green flame in the void and spoke to the Book of Epochs.

“Ah, I won’t live long either!” The presence in the Book of Epochs spoke and then, the green flame slowly flew back into it.

At the same time, a strange fluctuation flowed out of the Book of Epochs and rushed to where they had collided. It formed strange symbols, spreading outward.

Red blood energy droplets coalesced and gathered together. In the Nether Domain disciples’ shock, they formed Luotian’s flesh and blood, flying toward the Book of Epochs.

“Blood Rebirth—this is a technique of the Transcendent Peak! The Book of Epochs contains an existence equal to the elder!” Zhu Dezhi and others looked in disbelief, watching Luotian’s flesh and blood coalesce again.

“Ah, just a lingering old man. This old man’s strength must have dropped significantly after summoning this youth’s body. I never expected the old man to break through such a death trap! Invaluable…” The Nether Domain elder’s aged face showed a smile, but to the disciples it was grotesque.

In their elders’ presence, Lou Hongseng and Zhu Dezhi felt the intense killing intent.

“Take care of yourself,” a沧桑 voice echoed in the void, unusually clear and carrying deep exhaustion.

In the Nether Domain disciples’ eyes, Luotian’s body and the green flame slowly flew into the Book of Epochs. The disciples were speechless.

“This situation shows that this youth, Luotian, is still alive. He’s just incredibly lucky to survive between two Transcendent Peak attacks! It’s truly a miracle!” The Nether Domain disciples sighed, their faces filled with admiration but dared not speak. They respectfully gazed at the elder of the Nether Domain, one of the Nine Elders.

“Issue orders: use all available forces to stop the plans for other domains. I want this youth dead!” A playful voice echoed in the void, and the Nether Domain elder vanished from sight. Zhu Dezhi and others were left in stunned silence.

“What relationship is there between the terrifying presence in the Book of Epochs and our elder? It changed his long-standing plans!” Lou Hongseng and the others looked in disbelief, bowing to the void.

“The Four Sacred Star Domains will be in chaos!” The three men’s eyes gleamed with excitement, gazing at the slowly closing Book of Epochs.

…

On the Tianyuan Continent, everyone’s eyes were fixed on the Book of Epochs in the sky. Their faces bore anticipation, waiting for their hero to return.

Nan Gong Yuqing and Jiang Sxi stood outside the Book of Epochs. Jiang Sxi’s eyes held endless sorrow, hoping for a miracle.

After they exited, they didn’t tell others what had happened inside. They couldn’t be sure about Luotian’s situation, but they knew this time he was likely in grave danger.

But others weren’t fools; when everyone exited, only Luotian was missing. People guessed he had met trouble inside. Especially seeing Nan Gong Yuqing and Jiang Sxi’s sorrowful expressions, they felt a bad premonition.

Time passed slowly; it had been half an hour since Jiang Sxi and Nan Gong Yuqing exited. To the people, it felt like a year.

Finally, under everyone’s expectant gaze, the golden Book of Epochs emitted radiant light. A green flame floated out from it.

“Ah…” Seeing the emerald flame, everyone’s hearts sank to their stomachs. A foreboding feeling filled every person on the Tianyuan Continent.

“Is that Luotian’s Emerald Crystal Lotus Flame? How come it’s here!” Gu Lei’s face darkened, his voice trembling.

“Silence!” Gu Lei’s words hadn’t finished when Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan’s shrill voices echoed.

After scolding Gu Lei, the two women stared at the faint emerald flame in the sky. Tears glistened in their eyes as they shook their heads, trying to convince themselves it wasn’t true.

And in the sky, Jiang Sxi saw the fading emerald flame and nearly fainted. If not for Nan Gong Yuqing’s quick action to support her, she might have fallen from the sky.

“Tian’er…” Zhang Qiuyue cried out, disbelief in her eyes as she called. She never expected to see her son just briefly and then be left uncertain of his fate.

The entire Tianyuan Continent fell silent, everyone’s eyes wide with disbelief. They couldn’t believe their hero and genius of the Tianyuan Continent had vanished like that.

But the truth was before them: if Luotian were alive, his Emerald Crystal Lotus Flame wouldn’t have appeared. It was his life force; it would never drift out unless there was a special situation.

In the oppressive atmosphere, the Book of Epochs emitted another series of hums. A young body, like a corpse, appeared before the people’s eyes.

“It’s Luotian!” Someone shouted, their voice trembling with joy and excitement, drawing everyone’s attention back to the sky.

“Yes, it’s Tian’er! I said he wouldn’t die so easily!” Luo Xiong, Luo Nan Tian, and Zhang Qiuyue’s eyes, once filled with despair, now brightened as they gazed at Luotian’s lifeless form.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan also couldn’t hide their excitement, their feet creating gusts of wind as they rushed toward Luotian’s body.

Their speed was fast, but another person moved faster. Jiang Sxi appeared as a streak of light before Luotian’s body and embraced it tightly.

Seeing Luotian with his eyes closed, Jiang Sxi felt her heart break. She gently caressed his face; hope turned into despair.

Jiang Sxi’s hands felt no warmth from Luotian’s body, no heartbeat—his body was still powerful but lacked a soul. It was like a corpse with no spirit.

As Jiang Sxi prepared to investigate further, two cold voices echoed in her ears.

“Let go of him!” Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, their faces cold, approached Jiang Sxi. Without regard for her cultivation level, they pushed her.

Jiang Sxi’s face darkened; she was the first genius of the Qinglong Sect and now the Grandmaster of Tianyuan Sect. She was pushed by Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, her eyes turning cold.

But she knew these two women were the ones who had loved Luotian deeply. She sighed, reluctantly handing over Luotian’s body to them.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan held Luotian’s body and quickly checked it. Their faces, once hopeful, turned pale like paper after the check.

“How could this be? Luotian… you bastard, you haven’t even married me yet! Wake up!” Leng Qiuchan’s voice was desperate, echoing in the sky and causing people on the Tianyuan Continent to feel sorrow again.

Compared to Leng Qiuchan, Gu Qianxue was gentler. She gently caressed Luotian’s face: “You’re just exhausted, right? Rest now. I’ll take you home soon.”

“Qianxue, what’s wrong with you?” Leng Qiuchan heard Gu Qianxue’s voice and noticed her state was unusual. Her face showed worry; if Gu Qianxue had any more problems, Leng Qiuchan wouldn’t be able to bear it.

“I’m fine. Luotian is just sleeping. He’s exhausted; he carried all the burdens of the Tianyuan Continent alone for years. He needs rest!” Gu Qianxue held Luotian’s body close, answering Leng Qiuchan’s question and speaking to herself. She ignored others’ gazes and flew toward the ground with Luotian’s body.

The entire Tianyuan Continent was silent, everyone looking at Gu Qianxue with pity.

“This girl…” Gu Yun shook his head, a look of compassion in his eyes but not daring to disturb his daughter.

“Qianxue…” Leng Qiuchan wanted to speak but finally shook her head, following Gu Qianxue silently.

“You should come too,” Leng Qiuchan looked at Jiang Sxi, having guessed her relationship with Luotian from her actions. Especially when she saw Jiang Sxi’s slightly swollen belly, Leng Qiuchan felt a knife twisting in her heart.

“Boom…” As Gu Qianxue and the others hadn’t gone far, the Book of Epochs emitted a series of hums. The blood energy surged back into it, and the gate to the Nether Domain slowly closed.

After closing, the Book of Epochs flew toward the faint emerald flame in the sky, golden light spreading. The golden Book of Epochs instantly swept up the emerald flame and rushed toward Luotian.

The Book of Epochs moved fast; even Jiang Sxi, a nine-source Supreme Realm cultivator, couldn’t react in time. It rushed into Luotian’s body and appeared in his mind.

“What…” Jiang Sxi and others looked confused, unsure if the golden book was good or bad. But no one could stop it.

“It must be a good thing, right? Luotian’s current state can’t get any worse. This Book of Epochs is too mysterious; it’s impossible to understand!” Luo Xiong spoke. After all, he was the one who had brought the Book of Epochs to Bingei Island and it had eventually returned to Luotian’s body after many twists. It was truly touching.

Under people’s confusion, the golden Book of Epochs flew into Luotian’s mind. The emerald flame also slowly emerged from the Book of Epochs, flowing through Luotian’s meridians and settling into his dantian.

“Boom…” When the Emerald Crystal Lotus Flame landed in Luotian’s dantian, his heart gave a slight tremor and shook slightly. It was very weak; one would hardly notice it.

But Jiang Sxi and Leng Qiuchan, who had been closely watching Luotian, showed joy. They couldn’t speak from excitement.

“Qianxue, Luotian…?” Leng Qiuchan looked at Gu Qianxue with concern. Gu Qianxue still had that gentle expression, gently caressing Luotian’s face and flying toward the ground.

“What’s wrong with Qianxue? I feel her state is a bit off!” Gu Yun and others watching Luotian looked worried.

“It must be the heavy blow to Qianxue from Luotian’s state. They’ve been together since Tianyuan City, their feelings have surpassed life and death. It’s really hard!” Tiantai said, his old eyes filled with tears as he watched Gu Qianxue.

Nan Gong Yuqing frowned, his eyes flashing with light. Now he was the highest in cultivation on the Tianyuan Continent, a half-transcendent level. Naturally, he felt Luotian and Gu Qianxue’s changes. His hands flowed with blood energy, quietly moving.

A series of blood-colored symbols carried endless coldness and rushed toward Gu Qianxue, who was falling. People were startled.

“Don’t…” Gu Yun felt Nan Gong Yuqing’s blood energy and changed his expression, shouting to stop him.

But Nan Gong Yuqing’s cultivation level was too high; Gu Yun, a mere soul-merging peak cultivator, couldn’t stop him.

He pointed his finger, and a cold voice echoed like a demon’s song from Nan Gong Yuqing. Gu Qianxue, who had been gentle, suddenly paused. Blood energy entered her body, causing her eyes to flash red and regain a bit of clarity.

“Wake up!” Nan Gong Yuqing flicked his finger, and the blood energy flowed back. Black blood spewed from Gu Qianxue’s mouth, and she took a deep breath, her eyes instantly returning to clarity.
