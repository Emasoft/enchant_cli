Ko Zhen Tian was now filled with fear. He had never imagined that Luo Tian had become so powerful, and he alone could not subdue Luo Tian.

"Luotian, enough! Let us settle this peacefully. Show mercy where possible!" Chen Xuanning spoke again, urging him.

"I..." The middle-aged man had just begun to say he had no objections but was struck in the chest by Luo Tian's fist, rendering him unable to speak.

"Not speaking means you have objections. Objections are not allowed!" Luo Tian said, his voice cold and resolute. He had no intention of giving the middle-aged man any chance. His goal was to instill fear; killing one person alone could not achieve this, and he also used the opportunity to weaken the strength of the four major sects' affiliated sects.

With a single punch, the middle-aged man turned into a mist of blood, staining Luo Tian's pure white robe red. His soul was also shattered by the punch.

"Damn it, this kid won't let us go! We'll fight him!" Seeing the middle-aged man's death, those who had stopped their steps roared. Seven seven-source Heaven's Supremes rushed into the sky, charging toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 807: Unstoppable Momentum

On the sky above the Dongping Continent, Luo Tian stood calmly, his robe stained with blood. Seven streaks of light like lightning shot toward him.

Jiang Sixi's eyes flickered, about to act, but Luo Tian's voice echoed in her mind: "Stay there. These little pests won't challenge you! Have faith in me!"

Jiang Sixi halted mid-air, her gaze filled with concern but she could not disobey Luo Tian's words.

The disciples of the Tianyuan Sect looked expectantly at Luo Tian. If he could block all seven's attacks, it would prove his strength to rival Sha Cangmang and others. The future of the Tianyuan Sect would be limitless.

"Everyone, let us show mercy and avoid further conflict!" Chen Xuanning's voice echoed under the twitching gaze of the Tortoise Sage.

Hearing Chen Xuanning's words, Luo Tian slowly turned around, his gaze filled with respect as he gave a slight bow to Chen Xuanning: "Senior, today they trespassed on the Tianyuan Sect first. If I had lost, you would know my fate. Thus, I can only fight passively! As for casualties, I have always followed the principle: if they do not provoke me, I will not provoke them. If they provoke me, I will eradicate them completely!"

Luo Tian's cold voice echoed through the heavens. His unyielding words shocked everyone, even Sha Cangmang, Jin Yongsi, and Ko Zhen Tian felt a chill in their hearts.

Others watched the battle closely, secretly assessing their future relationship with Luo Tian.

"Arrogant..." A senior roared and unleashed seven sources of power, forming a colossal elephant. As the mighty elephant's leg extended, an overwhelming pressure immediately struck Luo Tian. The thick elephant leg stomped toward him fiercely.

"That's the master of the Elephant Sect, Seven-source Heaven's Supreme Xiang Xingyu. I never expected him to use his ultimate technique right away, intending to kill Luo Tian at once?" someone shouted in alarm.

"Sea of the Moon rises!"
"Supreme Yellow Spring!" A series of shouts echoed, and a terrifying surge shook the entire Dongping Continent.

The power of heaven and earth formed an immense pressure, rushing toward Luo Tian. Seven source-formed martial arts techniques thundered toward him with a deafening roar, and in an instant, they collided with Luo Tian.

"Is that all you have? Even Ko Zhen Tian and Jin Yongsi together could not defeat me. I've killed countless seven-source Heaven's Supremes. What are you?" Luo Tian's long hair fluttered, his body surrounded by a green aura. Thunder crackled around him, as if an ocean of lightning. His presence soared into the sky, unafraid of their attacks and showing no intention to dodge. He struck three punches.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The three punches fell, shaking the heavens. Each punch caused two martial arts techniques to explode in the sky, sending waves of invisible energy rolling outward. The entire sky darkened.

After three punches, the world seemed to lose its color; clouds churned, and only a golden hammer remained in the sky, smashing toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The hammer struck Luo Tian's body covered in green aura, shattering with a loud crash. Yet Luo Tian stood unmoved atop the sky, as if a celestial warrior. His gaze was disdainful as he surveyed the seven attackers before finally locking onto the first senior who had attacked.

The senior's heart trembled, his feet pressing into the void as he tried to flee. His face was filled with fear and disbelief, unable to muster any resistance. To him, Luo Tian was a monster; even seven seven-source Heaven's Supremes' combined attack could not harm him, which was beyond human capability.

"You're done! Now it's my turn!" Luo Tian's eyes were cold, his body transforming into a green great peng. Lightning flashed around him as he took one step forward and appeared before the senior, delivering a killing punch.

The senior's face showed terror; he had no will to resist. Luo Tian's presence made them feel like children facing an adult, powerless and unable to fight back.

Luo Tian's hand reached out, and the sky darkened. A darkness origin and a light attribute origin flew forth, forming a Taijitu pattern. They seemed to devour each other yet continuously generated, spinning rapidly and imprinting onto the fleeing senior.

The senior's slender body emitted a crisp sound, as if bearing thousands of pounds of pressure. His entire body was like a cannonball, crashing into the ground and creating a deep pit in people's sight.

"Trying to escape?" Luo Tian's eyes flickered, coldly looking at the other six.

The six scattered in different directions, hoping Luo Tian would be confused about whom to chase. Six streaks of light pierced the sky, rushing toward the distance.

The six fought with all their might, even burning their origins to escape a sliver of hope. Luo Tian was terrifying; besides Sha Cangmang, Jin Yongsi, and Ko Zhen Tian, no one else believed they could control Luo Tian.

"Escape is impossible!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his hands moving swiftly. A string of seals flew from his hands, forming long dragons that spread outward.

"Seal the Heavens!" Luo Tian pressed his hands into the void, and a terrifying sealing power instantly enveloped the entire Tianyuan Sect and its surrounding hundred miles.

A string of seals illuminated the sky, like stars lighting up the heavens.

Seeing Luo Tian's technique, Sha Cangmang's face showed intense emotion because the seal pattern in the sky was too familiar to him. It was the same technique shown by the paper golden book on the Superhuman Altar when they were about to leave. Sha Cangmang had never expected that Luo Tian could imitate it so closely within such a short time.

"This is Rule Power! I never thought this kid could wield Rule Power!" Jin Yongsi and others looked at Luo Tian with admiration, feeling even more terrified.

"This boy has become a force to be reckoned with!" Ko Zhen Tian whispered, his eyes filled with complex emotions as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Within ten years, Luo Tian will definitely be the fifth powerhouse in the Four Sacred Star Domains. No one can match him unless the four major sects unite!" Chen Xuanning spoke, his voice filled with nostalgia.

The four men's words left all sect masters in shock. They never expected the four giants to hold such a high opinion of Luo Tian.

Indeed, Luo Tian had not been idle these days, thinking about how to elevate his strength again. He eventually focused on the Epoch Book. When he stood before the Superhuman Altar, a single Epoch Book had suppressed heaven itself, leaving Luo Tian deeply impressed. He constantly thought about achieving the same power as the Epoch Book to suppress heaven. Based on his memories and insights, he imitated that scene.

As people discussed this, Luo Tian's figure appeared in their sight. He held three seven-source Heaven's Supremes in his hands, while the other three had escaped. It wasn't that Luo Tian couldn't catch them; those three had used a secret technique, burning all seven origins and dropping their cultivation to the Boundary Lord realm, thus escaping Luo Tian's pursuit.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Luo Tian threw the three into the ground, addressing the Tianyuan Sect disciples: "What should we do with these old men?"

"Kill..." A low roar echoed across the Tianyuan Sect's sky. The disciples' faces showed madness as they looked at Luo Tian in the sky. They had never expected Luo Tian to be so powerful; even the four giants could not handle him. Thus, they had no reason to worry anymore. Their previous emotions were all swept away by Luo Tian's strength, and they roared loudly.

Luo Tian said nothing, striking three punches that killed the three seven-source Heaven's Supremes again. Blood stained the ground, and Luo Tian seemed to have emerged from a sea of blood.

"Three days later, my Tianyuan Sect will issue a challenge to these sects. Please inform them!" Luo Tian's light killing of the three made Jiang Sixi smile, her voice echoing in people's ears.

People couldn't help but recall Luo Tian's previous words: "If they do not provoke me, I will not provoke them. If they provoke me, I will eradicate them completely." Jiang Sixi's actions clearly aimed to finish them off.

"Everyone, do you have any more opinions? Speak up quickly; we don't have much time. Since I'm still free, please speak out!" Luo Tian wiped the blood from his body, scanning the crowd before finally locking onto the four major sects.

"Who dares to object? Any objection means death! Who would dare to object?" people roared in their hearts, finally turning their eyes toward the four major sects, waiting for developments.

Sha Cangmang, Jin Yongsi, and Ko Zhen Tian fell silent, their gazes meeting Luo Tian's. Finally, the three nodded slightly: "We agree to the establishment of the Tianyuan Sect. Of course, three months later, I hope Jiang Sect Master does not back down; I will issue a sect war!"

"A sect war is when two sects with irreconcilable conflicts can initiate a battle, deciding their fates!" Ko Zhen Tian spoke, his voice echoing in people's ears, causing them to gasp.

A sect war, as the name suggests, is a battle between two sects and concerns their survival. If one side loses, it will be completely destroyed. Naturally, both sects can invite their affiliated and allied sects for help during such a life-or-death conflict.

Luo Tian had been in the Four Sacred Star Domains for so long, obviously understanding the meaning of a sect war. His brows furrowed slightly.

"Good... I accept!" Before Luo Tian could speak, Jiang Sixi's face showed a cold expression and she immediately accepted.

Chapter 808: Stabilizing the Situation

Above the Tianyuan Sect, Luo Tian stood on the sky with furrowed brows. Hearing Jiang Sixi's words, everyone's eyes turned to her.

Luo Tian was also puzzled. Normally, the overall strength of the Tianyuan Sect could not match any one of the four major sects. Luo Tian felt that beyond the Dongping Continent, there were dozens more Zhuque Sect disciples than his sect. He could not imagine how Jiang Sixi had the confidence to face Zhuque Sect's entire attack.

Shang Cangmang and others also looked at Jiang Sixi with interest, wondering what secret card she had to counter Zhuque Sect. Especially since Zhuque Sect also had Baihu Sect as an ally and several powerful affiliated sects.

"Rest assured, I have my own way!" Jiang Sixi transmitted her thoughts to Luo Tian, a confident smile on her face.

Luo Tian looked at Jiang Sixi's eyes filled with confidence, but a bad premonition arose in his heart. He understood one truth: the world had no free lunches. To let the Tianyuan Sect defeat Zhuque Sect so quickly, Jiang Sixi would definitely pay a price. This price might even be unbearable for Luo Tian.

"Good, Jiang Sect Master, truly bold! Then we'll wait and see three months later!" Ko Zhen Tian's face showed a smile, his gaze on Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi.

If Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi had not agreed, Ko Zhen Tian would have no way to handle them. Now that they had agreed, naturally, they needed to swear blood oaths; then they could not run away.

"I'll take the oath!" Luo Tian sighed, not waiting for Jiang Sixi to speak, he pointed his finger, and blood appeared in the air, forming seals on his forehead.

Ko Zhen Tian also did not hesitate, with a confident expression, completing the oath.

"Since it's so, we'll meet again three months later! We won't stay long!" Ko Zhen Tian coldly sneered, his body flickering and disappearing.

Jin Yongsi saw that they couldn't fight today either, so she gave a bow to Sha Cangmang and Chen Xuanning, leading the Baihu Sect disciples away from the Tianyuan Sect's sky.

"Good luck, you three! I won't interfere in your matters, and the Qinglong Sect's affiliated sects will not help Zhuque Sect. The gates of the Qinglong Sect are always open for you!" Sha Cangmang smiled, his gaze on Jiang Sixi. After speaking, he also led the Qinglong Sect disciples out of the Dongping Continent.

"Sect Master Jiang, my sect has other matters; I'll leave early!"
"Sect Master Jiang, my wife is about to give birth, so I'll go first and apologize later..." People kept speaking, finding various excuses to leave.

In an instant, the lively Tianyuan Mountain became nearly empty, with about seven out of ten sect masters leaving. Only weak sects and the affiliated sects of Xuanwu Sect remained, making it feel desolate compared to before. Even some attendants who had stayed behind left one by one, thinking that in three months, the Tianyuan Sect would definitely be destroyed by Zhuque Sect. There was no chance of victory, and staying there was just suicide.

"Congratulations on establishing your sect, young master!" Chen Xuanning smiled gently, addressing Luo Tian.

"Thank you, senior!" Luo Tian gave a respectful bow to Chen Xuanning, his face showing respect. Clearly, Chen Xuanning's stay was an encouragement for the Tianyuan Sect.

"Proceed with the remaining matters as planned!" Jiang Sixi showed no emotion, addressing Jiang Yimeng behind her.

Jiang Yimeng nodded and quickly resumed the opening ceremony. A bronze tablet appeared in people's sight, engraved with the powerful characters "Tianyuan Sect."

Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi jointly hung the tablet on the mountain gate of the Tianyuan Sect, announcing the official establishment of the sect.

"Kid, I didn't bring any gifts; I'll give you a protective array!" The old Xuanwu Tortoise slowly opened his eyes, his voice still lazy as he addressed Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi.

Hearing Xuanwu's words, the remaining people showed surprise. Xuanwu was known as the strongest defense in the Four Sacred Star Domains and one of the earliest to enter nine-source. He was an ancient being who had lived the longest. A powerful entity like him setting up a protective array would definitely be formidable.

Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi's eyes lit up. Both were skilled in alchemy, and the protective array of the Tianyuan Sect was something they had spent great effort to create. It was entirely due to their strength that they had built a nine-level array, which could only block one or two attacks from a terrestrial supreme. Basically, it was just a showpiece.

However, for a sect, a protective array was essential. A strong one could save the sect in times of crisis.

As Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi were happy, Xuanwu's old body slowly flew into the sky. His lazy eyes suddenly opened, his aura rising steadily, as if he had become a different person, like the master of this world.

A series of array flags flew out from Xuanwu's old body, carrying various origins and landing around the Tianyuan Mountain.

"One thousand... two thousand..." A total of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine array flags were instantly thrown out by Xuanwu.

With his hands like dry wood, they began to change slowly. Array flags transformed into various colors, gathering above the Tianyuan Mountain and forming a massive turtle shell-like structure. Strange patterns covered the entire Tianyuan Mountain.

Luo Tian could feel the array's complexity; even he would find it difficult to break through in a short time.

"Xuanwu Ice Heart Array! Completed!" Xuanwu roared, his voice sounding pale but echoing like the will of heaven in people's ears.

"Indeed it is the Xuanwu Ice Heart Array! I never expected Luo Tian to be so valued by Master Xuanwu. It is said that the Xuanwu Ice Heart Array was evolved from the patterns on Master Xuanwu's turtle shell!"

"Although this array is not as strong as Master Xuanwu's turtle shell defense, it is much stronger than a regular protective array. Previously, Baihu Sect's Jin Yongsi had begged Master Xuanwu to carve an Xuanwu Ice Heart Array for Baihu Sect, but he refused!" Some remaining sect masters showed envy as they looked at Luo Tian.

Xuanwu was undoubtedly the most respected figure in the Four Sacred Star Domains. People believed that even though Xuanwu's time was coming to an end, Sha Cangmang entering nine-source would still not match Xuanwu. Moreover, even if Sha Cangmang had a hundred chances, he would not dare to attack Xuanwu.

Not only was Xuanwu Sect non-aggressive, but also Xuanwu's prestige was beyond comparison to Sha Cangmang.

"Cough... Alright, this is the main array flag; you two keep it. This protective array should be able to withstand ten attacks from nine-source supreme, and this is the limit of what I can currently arrange. If you want it to be stronger, it would harm my foundation. My time is coming to an end, and the chaos will begin; I'd rather live a few more days!" Xuanwu spoke, nodding to Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi before closing his eyes and flying back to the seat prepared for Xuanwu Sect, falling asleep.

"Thank you, senior!" Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi bowed respectfully, a array that could withstand attacks from nine-source supreme was definitely beyond the Imperial grade.

"Sect Master Jiang, this is a ten-thousand-year phoenix branch; it's a token of my respect from the Zhulu Sect!"
"Sect Master Jiang, this is my hundred-warrior sect..." The remaining people also felt it was inappropriate not to offer gifts, as they were holding an opening ceremony. It would be hard to explain if they didn't bring any gifts.

Of course, some people were betting on whether Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi could survive this trial. If they did, their investment would yield great returns. After all, Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi were so young yet achieved such success; their future was boundless. For those who had given support in the snow, they would surely gain endless benefits.

Jiang Sixi smiled and skillfully conversed with various sect masters, while Luo Tian merely followed behind her. Whenever someone offered wine, Luo Tian would take the initiative to grab it and drink for Jiang Sixi.

"Sect Master is truly fortunate, finding such a good husband as Luo Tian!"
"Cut it out. Look at your condition and look at Sect Master's, don't be envious!" A group of remaining female disciples looked with envy at Luo Tian constantly blocking wine for Jiang Sixi.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye, and the opening ceremony of the Tianyuan Sect was finally completed. Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi's first step had been firmly established. The next challenge was to maintain it, and everything would depend on the sect war three months later.

In a luxurious room, Jiang Sixi rubbed her face, which had become stiff from smiling, and fell onto the bed with a long sigh. Although she was a seven-source Heaven's Supreme, such socializing was still uncomfortable for her.

Luo Tian's face showed a redness as he entered the room, looking at Jiang Sixi lying on the bed with a look of pity. He gently approached her and pressed his fingers on her head, sending out waves of chaotic origin to relieve her fatigue.

"You've worked hard. From now on, you don't need to involve yourself in sect matters; let Yimeng handle it. Your health is the most important!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a gentle expression.

"Are you concerned about me or my child in your belly?" Jiang Sixi lightly huffed, unsure if it was Luo Tian's technique that felt good or if she was questioning his intentions.

Luo Tian sighed, his gaze scanning Jiang Sixi's perfect body, swallowing his saliva as he kissed her smooth forehead: "You decide!"

Chapter 809: Longya Pavilion

Morning sunlight pierced into the luxurious room. Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi lay entwined in bed, having spent the night talking affectionately without doing anything due to Jiang Sixi's pregnancy. They had simply embraced each other, whispering sweet nothings until they fell asleep.

"Get up!" Luo Tian lifted Jiang Sixi, gazing at her perfect face. His body had a reaction, which he forcibly suppressed, standing up to open the window and let fresh air into the room.

Jiang Sixi naturally felt Luo Tian's reaction, a smile on her face as she acted like a little wife, adjusting his robe and then putting on the sect master's attire before stepping out with Luo Tian.

Jiang Yimeng had already been waiting at the gate, her face showing respect.

"Call all the Supreme-level disciples to the square; I'll take them to improve their strength!" Jiang Sixi ordered Jiang Yimeng.

Jiang Yimeng knew that the Tianyuan Sect was at a critical moment and dared not delay, transforming into a gust of wind and flying away.

An echoing bell rang throughout the Tianyuan Sect, breaking the silence of the morning and drawing all disciples to the square.

A series of brilliant lights and noisy voices broke the quiet morning, appearing on the Tianyuan Sect's square.

After yesterday's events, the number of disciples had decreased by two-thirds, leaving less than 500,000 standing on the Tianyuan Sect's square.

"Greetings to the Sect Master!" A unified voice echoed, 500,000 voices breaking through the sky, echoing in Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi's ears.

"Everyone must know that this is a critical moment for the Tianyuan Sect. Our current strength, if we face Zhuque Sect, would be destroyed in an instant; except for me and Luo Tian, all of you would die instantly!" Jiang Sixi's voice was authoritative.

Hearing Jiang Sixi's words, everyone fell silent. Those who had been attendants of the Qinglong Sect naturally knew Zhuque Sect's strength. They had stayed because of Luo Tian, trusting him.

"Of course, as the Sect Master, I cannot let you die! So I've decided to take everyone to a remote place. There, your strength will undergo a qualitative leap!"

"A remote place? Naturally, it contains endless dangers. But I can confirm that if you survive, your strength will definitely undergo a qualitative leap, at least three levels higher!" Jiang Sixi spoke, her voice light but thundering in people's hearts.

The square echoed with hurried breathing sounds as everyone looked at Jiang Sixi in disbelief.

A three-level increase meant that if they were currently one-source Supreme, after improvement, they would become four-source Supreme! And with the battle against Zhuque Sect coming in three months, it meant they needed to improve one level per month. Such a terrifying speed was comparable to Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi's genius, making people unable to resist.

Luo Tian remained calm, while Jiang Sixi had already told him about the place last night. To be honest, Luo Tian did not want Jiang Sixi to go, but she insisted on going. He knew he couldn't stop her.

"Everyone has the right to choose. I'll say this first: even I might not survive in that remote place. Perhaps only three out of ten will remain. Everyone has one morning to think; we'll depart at noon!"

"I'm going... it's just death, right?"
"I'm also going. Such a chance to improve strength is too tempting..." People roared, eager to go.

Jiang Sixi's place was too tempting. Their talents were average, but with such an opportunity, they couldn't miss it. Even if they died, in three months facing Zhuque Sect would be certain death. They had already given up their lives, so why not take the risk?

Seeing people shouting, Jiang Sixi nodded: "Good. Everyone go back and prepare. All Supreme-level masters will follow me to Longya Cliff at noon."

"Longya Cliff!" Hearing Jiang Sixi's words, the attendants showed fear. Longya Cliff was a famous dangerous place in the Four Sacred Star Domains, located on an uninhabited continent. Five thousand years ago, a glorious sect had entered Longya Cliff to explore its secrets but none returned. From then on, Longya Cliff gained the name of a forbidden place.

"Don't be afraid. I once obtained a map that allows entry into the outer part of Longya Cliff. We can collect herbs and gain blessings there. That sect wanted to enter the depths of Longya Cliff, so they never returned. We're only going to the outer part; it should be fine!" Jiang Sixi noticed people's fear and comforted them.

"Phew..." Hearing Jiang Sixi's words, people sighed in relief, looking at her with admiration. They never expected Jiang Sixi to find such a map. Thinking about Longya Cliff's mystery and the blessings of its outer part, people showed excitement.

After Jiang Sixi's order, the Tianyuan Sect disciples scattered to prepare for their journey to Longya Cliff in the afternoon.

"You're sure there's no problem?" Luo Tian looked serious, his first time showing a solemn expression as he gazed at Jiang Sixi. He had to go to Tiger Prison Star, so he couldn't accompany Jiang Sixi into Longya Cliff.

"Don't worry; there's no problem. Remember when my clone told you about the opportunity to enter nine-source Supreme? That was Longya Cliff. If you handle Tiger Prison Star properly, you can come to Longya Cliff and explore deeper with us!"

"If luck is on our side, you might even enter nine-source. Then who in the Four Sacred Star Domains would be your match!" Jiang Sixi's eyes showed anticipation, eager to see Luo Tian become a nine-source Supreme and dominate the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Seeing Jiang Sixi's decision, Luo Tian nodded without further words and spent the rest of the day talking with her until it was noon.

Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi returned to the square, where people had already prepared. Jiang Sixi addressed Luo Tian: "Take care!"

"Right!" They exchanged a smile, words unspoken but understood. Luo Tian's eyes showed tenderness as he watched Jiang Sixi lead nearly 100,000 Supreme-level disciples of the Tianyuan Sect disappear from his sight.

"Master, what should we do next?" Jiang Yimeng was left behind by Jiang Sixi. Since the Tianyuan Sect had just been established and there were no other people available, Luo Tian also needed to go to Tiger Prison Star. The only person both Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi trusted was Jiang Yimeng.

"I'll deal with those three escaped seven-source Supreme; otherwise, they'll always be a thorn in my side!" Luo Tian's eyes showed killing intent.

"As for the Tianyuan Sect's matters, let it run normally. Recruiting disciples is fine, but be strict; talent doesn't matter much, mainly focusing on character!" Luo Tian gave Jiang Yimeng a few instructions before leaving the array flags of Xuanwu Ice Heart Array to her. After tidying up, he flew out from the Tianyuan Sect.

Longya Pavilion was a well-known sect in the Four Sacred Star Domains, occupying an entire Longya Continent and managing several smaller continents like Dongping.

At this moment, Longya Pavilion was in a bleak state. The sect master, Long Wenxin, had returned to the sect two days ago and announced a retreat from all visitors.

But as time passed, Longya Pavilion's people received news that during the Tianyuan Sect's opening ceremony, Long Wenxin and seven other seven-source Supreme masters had caused trouble for the Tianyuan Sect. They were defeated by the genius Luo Tian, with four dead and three escaped but severely wounded.

As news spread, Longya Pavilion's people were in chaos. They marveled at Luo Tian's strength but also secretly blamed Long Wenxin for bringing such a powerful enemy.

"What should we do? Although there's been no movement from the Tianyuan Sect these days, it's just newly established and has no time to deal with us. If Luo Tian gets the chance, we'll be in trouble!" A six-source Supreme elder spoke with worry.

"Let's fight him! We have so many people; I don't believe he can kill us all with just one!" Another elder spoke, his eyes filled with hatred.

"Fight? What do you fight with? That kid killed seven seven-source Supreme masters! What do you fight with?" Another elder scoffed, refuting him. The hall became chaotic immediately.

Longya Pavilion's disciples were also worried, with some leaving the sect after hearing the news.

"Damn it, Baihu Sect hasn't reacted either! After all, the sect master was doing business for Baihu Sect!" Several elders roared in anger, feeling resentment toward Baihu Sect.

"Boom... Boom..." As people discussed this, a thunderous sound echoed from the sky above Longya Pavilion. The sound was like a lightning bolt, causing several elders to tremble.

"Longya Pavilion Sect Master, come out and die!" A cold voice swept through everyone's hearts. All instinctively shivered.

"Luo Tian has arrived!" Several elders stammered, their faces showing fear but not daring to delay. They vanished from the hall and appeared on Longya Pavilion's mountain peak.

"It really is Luo Tian!" The elders looked at the young figure in the sky, their hearts shocked but with a hint of flattery: "Welcome, Luo Brother, to Longya Pavilion!"

Chapter 810: Submission or Death

Above the Longya Pavilion, Luo Tian smiled as he looked at the chaotic Longya Pavilion. The entire mountain of Longya Pavilion resembled a cold fang, rising from the ground. From afar, it made people feel chilled to the bone.

"Buzz..." The fluctuation of energy echoed, making Luo Tian's smile deepen as he whispered: "They still resist!"

A帝品 (Imperial-grade) protective array appeared in Luo Tian's sight, surrounding the entire Longya Pavilion. A dark and cold aura rushed into his mind.

Luo Tian's eyes showed disdain, taking the Cracked Heaven Spear in hand. Eight sources converged into a long dragon that rushed into the dark Cracked Heaven Spear, making it roar with real power.

"Open!" Luo Tian struck the spear downward with one hand, and it shot through Longya Pavilion's protective array like lightning.

But next, Luo Tian was a bit confused; although the spear pierced Longya Pavilion's protective array, it did not break as expected but instead penetrated through the array and into Longya Pavilion's mountain body.

In an instant, the protective array slowly healed itself, returning to its original state.

The remaining disciples of Longya Pavilion felt a surge of hope but were terrified by the black Cracked Heaven Spear.

"This array was carved by a senior master of the sect in ancient times. I never expected it to be pierced by Luo Tian's spear! How terrifying must Luo Tian and this spear be!" The disciples of Longya Pavilion looked at the half-spear embedded in the ground, whispering in awe.

"Interesting!" Luo Tian smiled, his hands changing as eight-source Supreme strength revealed itself. A gray seal flew from the sky, forming a shadow and instantly appearing in the sight of Longya Pavilion's people.

The gray seal carried eight sources and heavenly power, sending a terrifying pressure through the barrier that invaded Longya Pavilion's disciples.

"Crack..." As people trembled, the seal in the sky slowly fell and collided with the green barrier. Thunder crackled, and a deafening roar echoed. Some low-level disciples could not withstand the pressure, their mouths bleeding.

The barrier of Longya Pavilion was instantly shattered by the Chaos Seal, and the thousands of array flags surrounding it exploded with a sound like firecrackers around Longya Pavilion!

"Longya Pavilion Sect Master, come out and die!" Luo Tian's cold gaze swept toward the back of Longya Pavilion. He could feel an old man sitting cross-legged on the ground in a cave behind, emitting waves of energy. It was one of the three elders who had escaped from his grasp.

"Welcome, Luo Tian Brother, to Longya Pavilion!" As people moved, several six-source Supreme elders appeared before Luo Tian, their faces showing respect.
