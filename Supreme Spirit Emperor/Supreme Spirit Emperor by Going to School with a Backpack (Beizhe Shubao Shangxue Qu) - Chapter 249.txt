“Divine Lady, our如意宗 is also a major sect in the Divine and Demon Domain. Are you truly intending to provoke us so greatly? Will you let a mere youth from the Four Saint Star Domains plunge the entire Divine and Demon Domain into chaos?” The senior elder of the如意宗, in the later stage of the Immortal realm, finally could not hold back and addressed Sun Mengru.

“Oh? The如意宗 is a major sect with prestige, so you need not sever your arms!” Sun Mengru’s face bore an unusual smile. Her beauty bloomed like a flower, causing Luo Tian and the remaining two Immortal disciples to momentarily gape.

“Thank you!” The elder of the如意宗 bowed respectfully toward Sun Mengru before turning to head toward the cave’s entrance.

At this moment, only one elder of the如意宗 remained. The Heavenly Clan had intervened in Luo Tian’s affairs; he knew their group could not kill Luo Tian. A day had nearly passed, and the elder of the如意宗 had already decided to withdraw from the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

Seeing this, others also wore smiles. Though the如意宗 was powerful, their sects were not significantly inferior. If Sun Mengru could make the如意宗 leave, they too would be released without having to sever their arms.

“you may die!” But just as the elder of the如意宗 turned, Sun Mengru’s cold voice echoed out, causing his face to instantly pale.

“Hum…” The Celestial Mechanism Diagram suspended above the crowd emitted a continuous humming sound. The gate opened, and golden sand poured forth from the Celestial Mechanism Diagram, instantly collapsing onto the elder of the如意宗.

The golden sand was none other than the Ten Directions Divine Soil Sun Mengru had previously used. Each grain of divine soil weighed as much as a star, and with ten measures in total, plus Sun Mengru’s cultivation at the middle stage of the Immortal realm, its power was unimaginable.

“Peng…” The heavy grains instantly crushed the elder of the如意宗 into a mass of flesh, burying him beneath the golden sand.

Sun Mengru’s gaze was sharp. Her hands glowed with gold, and golden inscriptions activated the divine soil, refining the elder’s flesh and blood.

People watched in shock, trembling. They had thought they could escape with their strength, but now, seeing Sun Mengru’s power, they felt uncertain.

Moreover, beside her was the prodigy Sun Feiwen. And Luo Tian, whose injuries were constantly recovering and whose qi was gradually surging again, coldly watched them. Luo Tian’s combat power had been witnessed by all.

In contrast, their side left five Immortal realm elders and two disciples who had been terrified out of their wits. Their strength was negligible.

These five Immortal realm elders were also all wounded, having suffered great exhaustion. Without the recovery of an ultimate immortal medicine, they would need three to four days to recover.

“I sever!” One elder of the later Immortal stage bit his teeth, gazing at Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen. His hand sliced through his arm like a blade, while the other arm was forcibly torn off by himself.

“Go!” Sun Mengru wore a satisfied expression, nodding to the elder, signaling him to leave.

“Farewell!” The elder of the later Immortal stage wore a fleeting look of resentment before heading toward the exit.

Seeing this, others had no choice but to submit. They had never been confident in the first place; losing one elder of the later Immortal stage made them even less so.

Sun Feiwen picked up the pseudo-epoch treasure of the如意宗, a smile on his face: “Truly lucky! Just entered and obtained a pseudo-epoch treasure!”

“Shameless!” Luo Tian stood nearby, watching Sun Feiwen’s smug expression, feeling an urge to hit him. The two had never gotten along since the ancient palace of the heavens, and Sun Feiwen had nearly died at his hands. If not for Sun Mengru’s face, Luo Tian would have already killed this arrogant youth.

Yet now, Luo Tian found Sun Feiwen somewhat endearing. Though the latter was arrogant, he genuinely cared for Sun Mengru.

Chapter 1070: Retreat

Within the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, Luo Tian watched Sun Feiwen arrogantly scolding several sect elders and disciples, embodying the image of a spoiled aristocrat.

In the past, Luo Tian would have looked down on Sun Feiwen’s actions. Even if they were his enemies, he had never liked it. But now, seeing Sun Feiwen no longer seemed so distasteful. Luo Tian knew that Sun Feiwen truly cared for Sun Mengru, and out of affection for her, he gradually accepted Sun Feiwen.

“Hurry up and sever your arms! Wait for me to act?” Sun Feiwen arrogantly pointed at the elders, his face showing arrogance as he scolded them.

Several sect elders glanced at Luo Tian. They noticed his qi gradually surging again, and the power within his body was nearly restored to its peak. Their faces turned grim.

At this point, they could only swallow their teeth and grit their jaws, each cutting off both arms and heading toward the exit of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

Luo Tian smiled, watching their departure. His gaze returned to Sun Mengru as he spoke: “The trouble is resolved. You two should leave too; the day is nearly over.”

“Won’t you go out?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Mengru furrowed her brows and asked.

“Hmm. My friend was devoured by the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower. I need to confirm his safety. If possible, I must find a way to bring him out. After all, this Divine and Demon Ancient Cave is extremely dangerous!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of concern as he gazed into the depths of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Then why waste time here? Go quickly!” Upon hearing about the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower, Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen’s faces slightly changed. As a divine child and divine maiden, they knew what the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower was.

“I!” Before Luo Tian could answer, Sun Mengru immediately led Sun Feiwen into the depths of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Alas!” Luo Tian sighed longingly, taking a step after the two. Though he did not want Sun Mengru to risk her life for him, seeing the determination in her eyes, he knew there was no way to stop her.

If it were elsewhere, Luo Tian would not have worried. But this strange Divine and Demon Ancient Cave could suppress even the Heavenly Palace Seal, preventing it from opening. This left Luo Tian without his greatest reliance—his means of survival.

But now, the only option was to exit the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. However, Luo Tian felt guilty toward Jiang Nanxuan and was deeply worried about any changes to him.

The three walked cautiously through the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, covering hundreds of feet without danger. However, after a few hundred feet, they felt immense pressure, slowing their steps.

“What is this pressure coming from? Why do I feel unable to resist it!” Sun Feiwen’s face showed shock. The more they advanced, the greater the pressure became, and their movements slowed.

Yet Luo Tian noticed changes on the ground. Compared to the previously flat surface, this stretch of ground looked as if it had been artificially excavated. Some deep pits were even ten or more feet deep, large enough to accommodate one or two people.

“Wait!” Luo Tian softly called out to Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen, crouching down to examine the golden soil dug up by hand. His face showed confusion.

“Did you notice? These pits were newly dug, though well concealed. Yet that aura could not be hidden!” Luo Tian’s gaze was deep and contemplative, his mind more puzzled. Who had dug this cave?

“Could there be someone ahead of us?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen also wore expressions of confusion.

“No. No one could have entered before us. The demonic aura was too terrifying; even an Immortal peak would be dead. A cultivator at the early epoch stage would not have lasted long!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, explaining the previous situation to Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen.

“Then why are these pits here?” Sun Feiwen spoke softly, his eyes also filled with concern.

“No! Someone!” Luo Tian recalled the events since entering the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. Suddenly, he remembered two people he had overlooked.

“Sun Kianian and his accomplices!” Luo Tian spoke, recalling the two fat men who had escaped under the attack of several sects.

“Sun Kianian? A tomb raider?” Hearing Luo Tian mention Sun Kianian, Sun Feiwen and Sun Mengru’s faces slightly changed. They had obviously heard of Sun Kianian.

“Truly two strange individuals! They’ve set their sights on the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave!”

“No wonder. It’s said that this Divine and Demon Ancient Cave is the burial site of the Divine and Demon Lord. For a tomb raider like Sun Kianian, it’s an irresistible temptation. Such people instinctively want to explore a tomb!” The three sighed as they gazed at the pits on the ground.

“Perhaps they knew there was danger ahead and dug these tunnels to bypass it!” Luo Tian felt the pressure that made people’s hearts race, speaking softly.

“Then should we try these pits to bypass the danger ahead?” Sun Feiwen suggested. Finding the correct tunnel could save a lot of time.

“Let’s not. With so many entrances, it would take us a long time to find the right one. We don’t have much time left. If we encounter danger ahead, we’ll just exit the cave!” Luo Tian calculated the time and spoke to them.

Sun Mengru nodded in agreement. Even though Sun Feiwen was reluctant, he would not defy Sun Mengru’s will. Soon, the three continued cautiously forward.

The pressure increased. The weakest among them, Sun Feiwen, quickly felt uncomfortable. This pressure was purely the authority of a superior over an inferior. Luo Tian and Sun Mengru had special bodies, so they only broke out in sweat. However, although Sun Feiwen’s body was strong, it still lagged far behind the reincarnation body and the primordial divine body.

“Are you okay? Should I let you wait here?” Luo Tian noticed Sun Feiwen’s discomfort and asked.

“No!” Sun Feiwen gritted his teeth, persisting. His body radiated golden light, following closely behind Luo Tian and Sun Mengru.

“Stubborn fellow!” Luo Tian shook his head, smiling lightly. He knew Sun Feiwen did not want to be looked down upon by him and Sun Mengru.

Luo Tian did not point it out. After all, geniuses are proud and do not want to be surpassed.

The three walked another few dozen feet. Though it was only a few dozen feet, even Luo Tian and Sun Mengru felt overwhelmed.

“Huff… huff…” Sun Feiwen’s breaths were heavy, his body emitting a continuous rumbling sound. His feet left deep imprints on the ground with every step, as if he had exerted all his strength.

“Huff… inhale…” Just as Sun Feiwen was about to give up, a series of heavy breathing sounds echoed in the three’s minds, causing their gazes to momentarily focus.

Then, the entire cave was illuminated by these heavy breathing sounds, fluctuating in brightness. The three immediately became cautious.

The Epoch Bell and the Celestial Mechanism Diagram flew out from Luo Tian and Sun Mengru’s hands, casting a radiant light that enveloped the three.

“I’ll go check. Wait here!” Luo Tian’s gaze was serious as he spoke to Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen.

“Don’t worry, your speed should know!” Seeing their refusal, Luo Tian explained again, his tone leaving no room for argument.

“Be careful!” Seeing the determination in Luo Tian’s eyes, Sun Mengru did not continue speaking. Instead, she placed the Celestial Mechanism Diagram over Luo Tian’s head. After all, the Epoch Bell was still cracked and had clearly suffered heavy damage.

Luo Tian did not hesitate. He activated the Celestial Mechanism Diagram and walked alone into the depths of the cave, each step more shocking than the last.

After walking for a quarter of an hour, a golden altar appeared before Luo Tian. At the same time, a golden figure sat cross-legged on the altar, eyes closed. Only then did Luo Tian finally realize where the heavy breathing sound came from.

An old man sat cross-legged on the altar, emitting an ancient aura. His eyes were closed, and his heavy breathing echoed from his nose. Each breath caused the surrounding space to tremble.

“Still alive!” Luo Tian could feel the blood and qi within the old man’s body still surged. Though he looked like he had lived for ages, his body exuded immense pressure, making Luo Tian want to kneel. Even on the half-step epoch stage of Diao Yuan, Luo Tian had never felt such overwhelming pressure.

“Epoch Stage!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed intense shock, gazing at the old man seated on the altar.

“A living Epoch Stage!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with waves. He stared at the old man seated on the altar.

The old man was bound by chains, with black and white inscriptions moving along them. It seemed the old man was trapped on the altar.

“Respectful elder!” Luo Tian bowed, his voice filled with reverence. His purple eyes gazed at the old man.

This gaze was no small matter; in an instant, Luo Tian’s face changed drastically. His eyes showed intense disbelief.

Black and white whirlpools rotated within the old man’s dantian, fiercely devouring each other. Just by looking at it, Luo Tian felt dizzy.

“Divine and Demon Cultivation!” Luo Tian spoke in shock, gazing at the dantian that made him dizzy and seemed to devour him instantly. His eyes showed intense shock.

Divine and Demon Cultivation—only the Divine and Demon Lord could achieve such a feat. Yet this old man, though powerful, Luo Tian knew he had not reached the level of an Epoch Lord.

Chapter 1071: The Mad Elder

Within the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with intense shock as he gazed at the old man bound by chains and seated cross-legged on the altar.

“Divine and Demon Cultivation!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with waves. He quickly收回 his gaze. He had never expected to encounter a person who could achieve such an extraordinary feat, and even more so, one still alive.

“He is Elder Dongbo Xin!” As Luo Tian marveled, the Celestial Mechanism Diagram emitted a series of fluctuations. Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen appeared before Luo Tian, their faces also filled with intense shock.

“You!” Luo Tian saw the two in front of him. He had not expected them to hide within the Celestial Mechanism Diagram, causing his face to show a faint smile.

However, he did not scold them. After all, their intentions were good. He returned to the topic and asked: “You know him?”

“How could we not? This great cultivator was from the same era as our Heavenly Clan’s old god. He even suppressed the Heavenly Clan’s god to be an unparalleled genius of his time!” Sun Feiwen spoke with a trembling voice, his body shaking along with the heavy breathing.

“However, later this elder also suffered greatly. Arrogant and overconfident, he wanted to follow the old path of the Divine and Demon Lord. He persisted in divine and demon cultivation, even without the Divine and Demon Ceremony. It was said that this legendary figure eventually drove himself mad, becoming a god during the day and a demon at night, constantly killing and slaughtering.”

“Later, Elder Dongbo also realized his condition. In a normal state, he chose to enter this remote place of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. I never expected him to survive until now! And he has become an epoch-stage cultivator! The chains, altar, and inscriptions must be his way of imprisoning himself!” Sun Feiwen’s eyes showed reverence as he spoke to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian and Sun Mengru also sighed. A legendary figure from the Divine and Demon Domain, in an era without epoch-stage cultivators, this Dongbo Xin was undoubtedly a dominant force. Yet he ended up in such a fate—truly pitiful.

“Let’s go. The time of divine and demon alternation is clearly when Elder Dongbo is in a normal state, but he hasn’t opened his eyes. He has sealed himself away. Unless the seal is broken, no one can awaken him!” Sun Feiwen spoke, though his words were so, he was still extremely wary.

Just as the three were about to continue walking, Luo Tian’s sharp eyes noticed a green medicinal herb beside Elder Dongbo. Even the old man’s powerful aura could not hide the plant's abundant vitality.

Black and white energy flowed from the herb’s petals, slowly entering Elder Dongbo’s body. Luo Tian’s face suddenly changed.

“Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with excitement. His spiritual sense pierced through the old man’s overwhelming pressure toward the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower.

As Luo Tian spoke, Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen also noticed the immortal herb beneath the mad elder. Their minds were stunned, gazing at the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower that continuously nourished Elder Dongbo with black and white energy, their eyes filled with intense disbelief.

“Jiang Brother!” Luo Tian did not care at all, shouting toward the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower. His spiritual sense felt a faint figure like a true spirit seated within the herb, eyes closed—clearly Jiang Nanxuan’s form.

While nourishing Elder Dongbo, it also nourished Jiang Nanxuan's seemingly weak soul. Luo Tian felt Jiang Nanxuan’s soul gradually strengthening.

Seemingly sensing Luo Tian’s call or his spiritual sense, Jiang Nanxuan's soul within the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower slowly opened its eyes.

“I’m fine. I encountered a great opportunity. You two leave quickly; the time of divine and demon alternation is coming! Don’t worry, I will definitely come out!” Jiang Nanxuan’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind before fading away.

“Opportunity!” Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He could feel that Jiang Nanxuan’s opportunity was definitely significant, perhaps related to the Heavenly Mirage Demon Flower and this mad elder.

Even so, Luo Tian was still concerned. He knew that great opportunities often came with great dangers; there’s no such thing as a free meal.

“Stay safe. We’ll wait for you to come out. Please hold on!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, watching the golden cave’s light gradually dim. He turned and walked with Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen toward the exit of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Go!” Luo Tian knew that the time of divine and demon alternation was about to complete. Soon, demonic energy would surge upward, and the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave would return to its previous state.

Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen also sensed the changes in the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. The three moved like lightning toward the exit of the cave.

Compared to their cautious entry, their exit was much faster. In an instant, they appeared at the place where Zhang Kianian and another had dug a tunnel.

“Roar…” Just as the three arrived at the hole they had dug, a loud roar echoed from an ordinary-looking cave entrance. Even from afar, the three felt a sense of fear.

Luo Tian heard the thunderous roar and furrowed his brows. He gazed at the seemingly ordinary cave entrance, his mind racing before a smile appeared on his face.

“Wait. Should we pull off a heist?” Luo Tian asked Sun Feiwen and Sun Mengru.

“A heist? What do you mean? It’s already this late! Why not leave quickly?” Sun Mengru furrowed her brows, puzzled by Luo Tian’s words.

“I was ambushed by these two bastards and nearly died? I won’t feel at ease unless I retaliate!”

“Earlier, the roar came from this cave entrance. It’s clearly their only way out. These two bastards will definitely come out through this hole. Then…” Luo Tian’s voice carried a playful tone.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Feiwen’s eyes immediately lit up. He quickly understood Luo Tian’s plan and wore a happy expression.

“Haha, this trip to the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave didn’t yield much. Zhang Kianian has roamed many great sects’ ancestral tombs. This time, he and his partner reached deep into the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. They must have obtained a great treasure. Their belongings are definitely full of valuable items. It’s the perfect chance to recover our losses!” Sun Feiwen spoke, clearly agreeing with Luo Tian’s plan.

“I see you’re becoming more endearing!” Luo Tian patted Sun Feiwen’s shoulder, his eyes showing a hint of satisfaction.

“I do too. Ha! Don’t worry, after we leave, I’ll protect you!” Sun Feiwen rubbed his hands together and began setting up with Luo Tian.

The two pointed their fingers, completely sealing the cave entrance. The three then hid on one side, waiting for the two to emerge from the hole.

“Be careful. These two bastards are strong, so don’t be afraid to kill them outright!” Luo Tian warned Sun Feiwen, reminding him. Zhang Kianian had escaped from the hands of an Immortal peak with strong hidden abilities.

“We’ll fight together. Mengru, watch the situation and don’t let them escape one by one. This time, we must make these two habitual scammers bleed!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and waited for Zhang Kianian to emerge from the cave entrance.

“Roar…” The thunderous roar echoed, sending a heart-stirring aura through the three. Luo Tian and the others furrowed their brows.

“Why do I feel these two inside might have triggered something? Where did this roar come from?” Sun Feiwen, hearing the heart-stirring roar, spoke softly.

“Let’s see what happens. If it doesn’t go well, we’ll escape immediately. I also feel these two bastards might have caused a mess!” Luo Tian’s voice carried a heavy tone as he stared intently at the cave entrance.

Time passed slowly. Under the three’s tense gaze, the tunnel finally emitted a series of fluctuations, causing Luo Tian to tighten his grip on the Cracking Heaven Spear.

“They’re coming out!” The three remained hidden, feeling a series of breaking sounds. Finally, two figures appeared in the sight of Luo Tian and the others.

Zhang Kianian and the thief wore expressions of relief as they emerged from the cave entrance. However, just as they appeared at the entrance, their faces suddenly changed.

“Attack!” Luo Tian called out to Sun Feiwen and Sun Mengru, his body surging forward. He activated the Instant Teleportation technique, instantly appearing behind the two.

Luo Tian raised his Cracking Heaven Spear high and used it as a staff, directly smashing Zhang Kianian’s round head.

On the other side, Sun Feiwen somehow found a holy weapon staff and smashed it onto the thief’s head. The force was so great that Sun Feiwen's holy weapon staff almost shattered.

Zhang Kianian and the thief had long formed a sense of danger, feeling an ominous premonition as soon as they emerged from the cave. However, Luo Tian’s Instant Teleportation was too overwhelming. If given enough time to prepare, it would be a divine technique for ambush and escape.

As soon as they felt something was wrong, they were caught by Luo Tian and Sun Feiwen. They were struck like lightning, then their vision went dark before collapsing onto the ground.

Sun Mengru’s hands glowed with golden light, casting an unparalleled divine technique to seal the two’s dantians. After all, they were not good people; it was better to be safe.

“Bastards! Daring to trick me, Luo Tian!” Luo Tian looked at Zhang Kianian’s head with a crack and rubbed his hands, his eyes filled with excitement.

Sun Feiwen also had golden light in his eyes. Thinking about the treasures on their bodies, his gaze turned greedy.

Chapter 1072: Robbery

Within the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, two figures lay in a pitiful state before Luo Tian and the others. Both had cracks on their heads, eyes closed, lying outside the tunnel.

“Two bastards; they probably never imagined this day would come!” Luo Tian’s voice was filled with laughter as he gazed at Zhang Kianian and the thief.

“I didn’t expect it to be Master of Empty Hands, Si Mao!” Sun Feiwen looked at the thief and revealed his name.

“This man is also a famous thief in the Divine and Demon Domain. He specifically targets major sects, claiming he can steal anything. His biggest case was once stealing a pseudo-epoch treasure from the Yin Yang Sect. He was later chased by the Yin Yang Sect and had no choice but to return it, saving his life! I never expected these two to team up!” Sun Feiwen’s face showed a sigh, shaking his head lightly.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of shock. The Yin Yang Sect was known as the third major sect in the Divine and Demon Domain. A pseudo-epoch treasure of such value—this thief must not be ordinary.

“Haha, steal! The more you steal, the cheaper it is for us!” Sun Feiwen grabbed the thief’s body and smiled.

“These two bastards are really extravagant. These clothes are holy weapons! Holy weapon-grade robes aren’t common!” Sun Feiwen didn’t hesitate, immediately stripping the two of their clothes and storing them in his storage ring.

Luo Tian’s mouth twitched as he watched Sun Feiwen, seeing the glint of greed in his eyes. It reminded him of Xu Liyi, and both had the same gaze when they saw treasures—clearly two people who took everything they could.

Luo Tian reached for Zhang Kianian’s finger and removed his storage ring. With powerful spiritual sense, he quickly broke the ring's restrictions. His face then showed a hint of joy as he waved his hand, collecting thousands of flying swords.

“Clang clang!” Various treasures appeared before the three. On the other side, Sun Feiwen also broke the restrictions of the thief’s storage ring, scattering treasures across the ground.

“Wow…” The three stared at the treasures covering the ground and took a deep breath.

“I swear, you’re a mobile treasure trove. Now it seems you’re even worse than them; compared to them, I’m just a beggar!” Sun Feiwen shouted, grabbing a small tower the size of a palm. It was crystalline and transparent.

“This is the如意宗’s如意 Tower! How did these two scammers get it? This is the Wuyashi Temple’s Soul-Grasping Bead! It was said that the Wuyashi Temple searched for this bead for five years, but eventually gave up. I never expected it to be on these two bastards!” Sun Feiwen’s eyes showed shock.

Luo Tian and Sun Mengru were also stunned, gazing at the treasures scattered across the ground. Just pseudo-epoch treasures alone amounted to five or so.

Five pseudo-epoch treasures—what does that mean? Luo Tian had only two pseudo-epoch treasures, and he was chased by nine regions’ people to the point of no escape. It was equivalent to a major sect’s pseudo-epoch treasure count.

Besides the pseudo-epoch treasures, other treasures were also holy weapons. But they weren’t ordinary holy weapons; they were precious and had different uses.

“Holy medicine!” Luo Tian grabbed three jade bottles. Even through the bottles, he could feel the intense holy medicine within.

“Rich! Very rich!” Luo Tian and Sun Feiwen continuously divided the treasures, splitting them into three parts—each person getting one.

“I’ll check their minds and dantians for any treasures!” Luo Tian spoke, his spiritual sense entering their minds.

Zhang Kianian’s golden mind was filled with pure energy, making Luo Tian’s spirit happy. He felt Zhang Kianian’s mind must have treasures.

As soon as he entered, Luo Tian was shocked. He stared at the white tortoise shell floating above Zhang Kianian’s mind, which had a slight fluctuation but still made Luo Tian shocked.

“This!” Luo Tian stared at the white tortoise shell. He quickly thought of the tortoise shell he had bought at an auction in the Demon Region. Except for the color, everything else was identical. However, his tortoise shell was sealed.

Luo Tian tried to communicate with the tortoise shell using spiritual sense, but in an instant, it emitted a continuous humming sound, expelling Luo Tian’s spiritual sense from his body. It even had the potential to purify his entire soul.

A holy aura radiated from Zhang Kianian, white light that made one want to worship it.

“Damn! What did you touch? These two bastards are about to wake up!” Sun Feiwen jumped and quickly gathered all the treasures.

“Epoch Treasure!” Luo Tian’s eyes were fixed, showing disbelief. In that moment when his spiritual sense touched the white tortoise shell, he felt the aura of an epoch treasure. That feeling was familiar—he had felt it before on the ancient heavenly palace.

“Never mind, let’s go. His mind has something extraordinary. Quickly gather and prepare to leave!” Luo Tian urged Sun Feiwen.

Actually, there was no need for Luo Tian’s urging. Sun Feiwen had already started working, stripping the two of their clothes. After all, they were full of treasures. If it weren’t for Sun Mengru being present, Luo Tian estimated that Sun Feiwen would have even stripped their underpants.

However, at this moment, they were left with only their underwear. Though it was also a treasure, due to Sun Mengru’s presence, Sun Feiwen didn’t strip it. Even so, Sun Mengru turned her back.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of smile. He imagined their expressions when they woke up, feeling much better.

“Roar!” The roar interrupted Luo Tian. A series of thunderous roars echoed from the cave entrance, growing closer.

At the same time, black demonic energy slowly rose, and white light gradually dimmed.

“Go!” Luo Tian felt something was wrong. If they didn’t leave now, there would be no chance left. He spoke to Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen, his body like lightning toward the cave entrance.

In an instant, the three flew out of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, appearing under the starry sky. They all sighed deeply.

As soon as they appeared, surrounding cultivators gasped in amazement. Their eyes looked at Luo Tian and the others with a hint of greed.

However, when people saw Luo Tian standing with the divine maiden and the heavenly clan, they immediately returned to normal. Their eyes looked at Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen with respect.

Several sect elders who had been forced by Sun Feiwen and Sun Mengru to sever their arms watched the three emerge unharmed. Their eyes showed a hint of resentment. At this point, their arms had fully regenerated, but their faces were pale, obviously having suffered much.

They hadn’t left because they hoped Luo Tian and the others would perish in the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. As soon as the three appeared, several sect members turned and left.

“Boom…” Just as Luo Tian and the others reached the front of the crowd, the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave suddenly surged with a massive fluctuation. Black and white energy surged, filling the entire cave. A series of roars echoed from within.

“Again it has returned! So many people entered, but only a few came out. I wonder if they obtained the Divine and Demon Ceremony!” People showed a hint of sigh, gazing at the massive fluctuation in the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

Finally, people focused their gaze on Luo Tian and the others. They were the last to come out, so they had a higher chance of obtaining the Divine and Demon Ceremony.

However, people didn’t have high hopes. After all, it was only a day; it was impossible to reach the deepest part of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Everyone, disperse!” Sun Feiwen spoke to the surrounding people, his voice filled with a hint of expectation. He gazed at the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Won’t these two bastards die inside?” Sun Feiwen transmitted to Luo Tian and Sun Mengru, his voice filled with confusion.

“No. They’re not ordinary people. When we left, they were about to wake up. It should be fine!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly.

“Ah…” Just as Luo Tian finished transmitting, two cries of pain echoed from the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. People’s faces showed vigilance.

“There is something coming out of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave!” People’s eyes showed a series of concerns. They thought of the roars they had heard before and looked at the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave with concern.

The Divine and Demon Ancient Cave was so terrifying. It was said that a powerful monster was sealed in its depths. If this monster broke free, it would be a disaster for the Divine and Demon Domain. It was said that the Divine and Demon Lord chose to sit in meditation here for the purpose of suppressing the monster.

A booming sound echoed. Black and white energy violently surged, and in the chaos, a white light flashed out, pushed by black and white energy from the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Tortoise shell!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of smile, gazing at the white tortoise shell beneath the two pale figures.

“They’re out!” Sun Feiwen’s eyes also showed a smile. Then he looked at the white tortoise shell, his eyes showing disbelief.

“These two bastards still have treasures. I swear!” Sun Feiwen transmitted to Luo Tian and the others, his voice filled with disbelief and amazement.
