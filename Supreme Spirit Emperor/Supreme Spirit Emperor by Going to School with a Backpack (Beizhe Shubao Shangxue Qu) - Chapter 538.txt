A single word of explosion caused Chen Xiao's pale complexion to turn utterly grim, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed through the hall, and that black tiger instantly twisted, a cataclysmic wave spreading outward.

Power surged in all directions, terrifying explosions resounded through the hall, and that black tiger vanished instantly, replaced by a wave of destruction.

"Ahh..." Chen Xiao cried out in agony, his proximity to the force making him bear its full weight.

In an instant, Chen Xiao's body could no longer endure and began to disintegrate, leaving him powerless against the onslaught.

"Crash..." The shelves in the hall trembled violently before collapsing, and Tianfu's group formed a barrier.

"He truly let go!" Their minds echoed with this thought, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian standing amidst the storm.

The tempest subsided, revealing Chen Xiao's tattered body, his entire lower half obliterated. The terror of a Superior Divine Artifact's explosion was evident.

"Clang..." A black long sword fell from the sky, but it had lost its divine essence. Reverting to a Superior Divine Artifact would require prolonged cultivation.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian soared into the air, his spear—Rip-Heaven Spear—now in his grasp. He descended like a god of heaven.

"Pop..." The Rip-Heaven Spear pierced Chen Xiao's throat, ending his life instantly.

"He killed a Late-stage True Immortal!" Their minds recoiled in shock, though Chen Xiao's condition had been dire. Yet he was still a Late-stage True Immortal.

The final blow came from the explosion of the Superior Divine Artifact, but Luo Tian's strength was undeniable. Who would risk losing a Superior Divine Artifact? Yet Luo Tian did.

"Senior Brother, how long will you keep me in the dark?" Luo Tian addressed the blood-stained sky, returning to Lei Yong's side.

At that moment, Luo Tian understood Zhang Ziping's intent, reminiscent of the Five Elements Sect's past. Zhang Ziping had allowed all sect geniuses to challenge him, an extreme method with remarkable results. Now Luo Tian had reached the Early-stage True Immortal.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian extended his hand, retrieving the Shooting Sun Bow and Destroying God Arrow. He drew the bow, aiming at Guiya locked in combat with the blood-stained sky.

At the Half-True Immortal stage, Luo Tian's Shooting Sun Bow and Destroying God Arrow had slain a Mid-stage True Immortal. Now, he was confident they could eliminate a Late-stage True Immortal—provided the latter allowed him to draw. If he did, it might not kill Guiya outright but would certainly trouble him.

"Crinkle..." The Shooting Sun Bow slowly activated, and within moments, Luo Tian had drawn it halfway. This was his previous limit.

Afterward, Guiya's expression shifted slightly as he sensed a threat.

"How many Superior Divine Artifacts does he have?!" Guiya noticed Luo Tian's bow and arrow, his cold gaze fixed on the latter.

Time passed slowly; the nascent True Immortal energy in Luo Tian's dantian surged violently, and the Destroying God Arrow radiated divine light. Its tip shimmered with divine laws.

At last, as the bowstring neared full moon, Luo Tian could no longer hold back and released it.

Golden divine light vanished from his grasp, but Guiya—locked in battle with the blood-stained sky—instantly formed a black mist.

Chapter 2061: The True Inheritance

The golden divine light shot toward Guiya's formless black mist, the Destroying God Arrow piercing through it. It penetrated the hall's wall with a resonant hum, droplets of blood falling from its tip.

"Freezing Winter!" The blood-stained sky's eyes lit up, his ice sword erupting in a torrent of cold. Nine icy dragons surged forth, enveloping Guiya's black mist.

"Crack..." The cold air instantly froze the black mist, revealing Guiya's grotesque face beneath.

"Shatter Cold!" The blood-stained sky pointed, and the ice sword flew forth, piercing the frozen black mist.

In an instant, the ice sword struck the frozen mist, and a cacophony of cracks echoed. The entire black mist shattered into fragments, scattering across the hall's ceiling.

"Buzz..." A hum resonated as black energy emerged from the frozen fragments, coalescing into Guiya's pale face.

"Rip-Heaven Claws!" Guiya roared, his withered hands extending, their nails gleaming and growing rapidly.

Luo Tian and the blood-stained sky's combined efforts had wounded Guiya severely; without his survival techniques, he might have already perished.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian panted heavily; he had only managed one shot. The subsequent battle was beyond his control.

Yet Luo Tian's confidence in Zhang Ziping's strength remained firm. Even if he couldn't kill Guiya, he could certainly subdue him. Prolonged combat might eventually eliminate Guiya.

"Ultimately, he couldn't hide it," Zhang Ziping mused internally, gripping his ice sword as he lunged toward Guiya's pale face.

"Second Senior Brother!" Luo Tian's expression darkened, gazing at Lei Yong, whose breath was faint. His eyes welled with emotion.

"Little Tian, don't blame us," Lei Yong's face momentarily regained color, even managing to speak.

"Among the brothers, you've achieved the most. Back in the Nine Realms, you bore everything alone. But here in the Immortal Realm, we wanted to do something for you. Though our methods were extreme, we aimed to see your rapid growth," Jicheng spoke, his first lengthy confession.

"I understand. I don't blame you." Luo Tian's voice trembled as he crushed pills, infusing Lei Yong with vitality.

Lei Yong was now extremely weak; Chen Xiao's final strike had shattered both his body and soul.

"Seal the Soul!" Luo Tian pointed, sending waves through Lei Yong's body. His disintegrating soul stabilized slightly, but his vitality continued to wane, black energy seeping through him like a parasite.

"Immortal Life Medicine!"

Luo Tian knew only the Immortal Life Medicine could save Lei Yong. Even his fused blood with the medicine was insufficient; it could only prolong life, not save it.

"Buzz..." Golden blood shot from Luo Tian's fingers, landing in Lei Yong's mouth, restoring his pallor.

Lei Yong gazed at the anxious Luo Tian, smiling before glancing at him and Jicheng. He then closed his eyes, his aura steadied but still declining.

"What to do?" Luo Tian's heart raced as he pondered how to heal Lei Yong. The Immortal Life Medicine was all stored in the Nine Realms, not brought to the Immortal Realm. Thus, he could only watch helplessly.

As Luo Tian fretted, waves emanated from the hall, and nine figures appeared within it.

Nine figures, their power formidable—six were disciples of Bountiful Heaven City, three were Hellish Cultivators. Upon entering the hall, they were drawn to Zhang Ziping's group's battle and swiftly took positions in the corners.

After these nine figures arrived, the entire Yama Palace trembled with resounding noises. Those who hadn't mastered the Hundred Ghost Sealing Seal technique turned pale, sensing terrifying waves beneath their feet.

"Damn... eighteen are gathered. Are we doomed?"

"I won't accept it! I was just one seal away!" Voices of despair rose beneath them.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sounds of the Hundred and Eight Palaces erupted, their altars exploding violently.

"Yama Palace has exploded!" Those outside the Hundred and Eight Palaces, like Wu Mian and Ke Duanshan, halted their fight instantly, gazing at the exploding Palaces.

"What's happening?" Those within the Hundred and Eight Palaces, who hadn't entered the light column before, were puzzled. They felt an overwhelming force engulfing them.

"So soon?" In the space Luo Tian had occupied, a youth with black mist on his face smiled.

"Buzz..." The group felt the hall tremble violently; Zhang Ziping's group ceased their fight, eyes cautious.

"Winter Destruction!" Zhang Ziping approached Luo Tian and the others, extending his hand. A cold dragon emerged from it but instantly turned blood-red.

"Crack..." Blood-red ice crystals enveloped Lei Yong, who was then taken by Zhang Ziping.

"His vitality is sealed. This hall seems to be collapsing; we'll find a way out later," Zhang Ziping didn't remove his mask, for his appearance was now aged beyond recognition.

"Senior Brother!" Luo Tian and Jicheng stood behind Zhang Ziping, feeling a mountain-like presence shielding them.

Yet Luo Tian recalled Jiang Chen's words earlier—The blood-stained sky had only fifty years left. And the battle had drained Zhang Ziping's vitality, especially sealing Lei Yong.

"Seems I must go to Hell," Luo Tian's eyes hardened. He hadn't wanted to enter Hell before, due to his feud with the blood-stained sky. But now knowing the latter's identity and Zhang Ziping's intentions, he would risk everything to save him.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

Black waves surged, the entire Yama Palace collapsed completely, and Luo Tian's group vanished into thick black mist. Each of the Hundred and Eight Palaces had a seal rising.

The entire barrier trembled with black mist, while Wu Mian and Ke Duanshan watched from outside. A powerful aura emanated from within the barrier, even causing Wu Mian to feel a chill.

The thick black mist instantly engulfed Luo Tian's group, a powerful冲击 force rising beneath their feet. In an instant, it struck them, sending them flying.

"Senior Brother..." Luo Tian was thrown into the air, shouting but suffocated by the black mist.

The entire world plunged into darkness; a hum resonated, and a golden seal appeared in Luo Tian's vision. This seal was composed of one hundred and eight seals, originating from the altars where Luo Tian's group had previously calculated the Hundred Ghost Sealing Seal. It was also the source of this cataclysmic explosion.

At that moment, the one hundred and eight seals converged into Luo Tian's vision.

"Boom..." The seal roared, rising skyward through layers of black mist toward the barrier.

The black barrier trembled violently; Wu Mian and others retreated instantly, sensing it would soon shatter. If it did, the destruction would be apocalyptic.

"Crack..." A brittle sound echoed; the black barrier could no longer withstand it, and under Wu Mian and Ke Duanshan's horrified gazes, it shattered with a thunderous crash.

In an instant, the deafening roar of explosions filled the sky, black mist surged through heaven and earth. The golden seal appeared in people's sight, vanishing into the heavens within moments.

"That's it! The true inheritance seal of Yama!" Wu Mian's breath quickened instantly.

"No one has obtained Yama's inheritance!" Ke Duanshan's expression changed.

"Buzz..." The heavens hummed; the seal shot toward the heavens, shaking the world. Black skies rose a vast vortex, as if the sky itself trembled before it.

Wu Mian wanted to rush forward and seize it, but black mist spread instantly, a powerful冲击 force preventing him from moving. He dared not move either; the seal's presence radiated an overwhelming pressure, even leaving Wu Mian immobile.

The golden seal vanished into the heavens, and the surging black mist swept across much of Hell.

Figures descended from the sky, scattering across Hell's four corners, including Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt dazed, instinctively activating the Reincarnation Heaven Art to withstand the powerful冲击.

Most of Hell plunged into darkness, but as Luo Tian activated the Reincarnation Heaven Palace, a golden seal suddenly emerged from the heavens, vanishing into his body.

"Has the world changed?" Hell trembled violently; everyone gazed at the pitch-black sky. Yet, due to Hell's vastness, no one noticed those descending from the sky.

"Return!" Wu Mian's face darkened, addressing his subordinates behind him. He had no time to detain Ke Duanshan's group now.

"Our people have fallen into Hell," Ke Duanshan's face was grim, exchanging glances with his fellow commanders. They watched the dissipating black clouds above.

Chapter 2062: Fallen into Hell

As Yama Palace exploded completely, its disciples were scattered across Hell.

Some landed near Bountiful Heaven City, though dangerous, they could return within a short time. Others fell far from Bountiful Heaven City, unable to return in days; some with insufficient strength were directly killed by the explosion.

As time passed, most Bountiful Heaven City disciples returned to their city. Yet many remained in Hell, missing and presumed dead—Luo Tian among them.

This event spread through Hell's ghost gates, even alarming Hell's forces. The Beast Ghost King, one of the Eight Great Kings of Hell, issued an order to capture all disciples who had fallen into Hell.

Hell was vast—how vast no one knew. Some claimed it surpassed the Immortal Realm significantly.

Legends said Hell was once part of the Immortal Realm, a place for exiling the most heinous criminals. But as Hell grew stronger, it rebelled and broke away from the Immortal Realm.

These were just legends; time was too long, and no one knew how Hell originated.

Yet all knew that Hell's current strength was equal to, if not surpassing, the Immortal Realm.

The entire Immortal Realm was governed by the Ten Kings of Hell, their forces stationed in the core of Hell's Eighteen Levels.

Around these levels were each Great King's territories, with the Eight Great Kings acting like regional governors across eight directions.

Below the Great Kings were families, some large, others small; then came the Eight Gates of Jiuxuan Ghost Gate.

The gate opened by Wu Mian in the End Times Forest was one of these gates, but it had been sealed. Now only seven remained.

Hell's environment was treacherous; spiritual energy was nearly nonexistent, while ghostly energy was thick and abundant—paradise for ghosts.

At that moment, in an unknown region of Hell, black small hills and a large black tree stood. Luo Tian lay dazed against it.

Half a month ago, he had fallen here from the sky. The explosion's power was immense, leaving him severely wounded; after half a month of recovery, his injuries were only partially healed.

After recovering most of his wounds, thunderstorms erupted in the sky, halting Luo Tian instantly. He knew his True Immortal Trial was coming.

Previously in Yama Palace, he had become a True Immortal but hadn't undergone the trial. He never expected to face it immediately after emerging.

Yet he was grateful this trial had some humanity, not descending upon him the moment he emerged. If it had, he would have been dead for sure.

Luo Tian had witnessed Guan Hongsheng's trial before, an apocalyptic event even龙雀 (Dragon Sparrow) dared not enter.

Luo Tian stopped because he didn't want to undergo the trial now, unsure of this place's location. If he did, it might cause further damage and attract other Hell cultivators—dangerous.

"Unexpectedly, I've finally entered Hell," Luo Tian muttered, standing up slowly and approaching a corpse nearby.

This corpse had been there when he awoke—its body was a youth, somewhat handsome but already withered. He'd likely become bones soon.

Luo Tian grabbed the corpse's storage bag, squeezing it to reveal scattered items on the ground.

"Truly poor..." Luo Tian shook his head, observing the items.

A few treasures lay on the ground—only one was a Daoist Treasure, the rest were no match for even a Daoist Treasure. Luo Tian dismissed them.

What caught his attention was several jade slips on the ground. He picked one up, and its information instantly imprinted in his mind.

The jade slips recorded messages akin to a will, along with information about the forces in this region.

"Is this the territory of the Beast Ghost King, one of the Eight Great Kings?"

"He's Luo Chen, a junior member of the Luo Family within the Beast Ghost King's forces. He was hunted by his family here and died." Information flooded Luo Tian's mind.

The Luo Family behind the corpse was known for taming beasts, and in Hell, ghosts were akin to fierce beasts in the Immortal Realm.

"Distance to Kanmen requires a year of flight..." Luo Tian was speechless, surprised the explosion had sent him so far.

"Unknown how my brothers are doing. Second Senior Brother's condition is dire; Master Senior Brother's lifespan is also an issue," Luo Tian muttered, his eyes filled with worry.

"If I've entered Hell, then find the彼岸花 (Biyanghua)!" Luo Tian muttered, picking up another jade slip.

"Feeding Ghosts Technique..." Information flooded his mind again—this was something he'd never heard of.

This information detailed how to raise ghosts, transforming weak ones into strong.

"Interesting..." Luo Tian's eyes lit up with amusement but soon turned solemn, even astonished.

Luo Tian had the Ghost Taming Seal, so he hadn't taken this Feeding Ghosts Technique seriously. But after reading it, he realized there were always greater beings beyond oneself.

"The information records how to condense a ghost into form, then raise it to the level of an Immortal King!"

However, this was merely Luo Chen's theoretical calculations; he hadn't practiced it before being killed here.

"Raising a ghost to the Immortal King level!" Luo Tian sighed deeply; although Luo Chen was only at the Heavenly Immortal stage, his talent was evident from this jade slip.

"Different—this is the Feeding Ghosts Technique, not Ghost Taming. It's unlike my Ghost Taming Seal!"

Luo Tian also learned about a profession in Hell: the Feeding Ghosts Master.

In Hell, a Feeding Ghosts Master held the same status as an Immortal Alchemist in the Immortal Realm. If someone raised a ghost to the Immortal King level, their status would be supreme in Hell, even beyond the Eight Great Kings' authority.

Unfortunately, raising an Immortal King-level ghost was extremely difficult; such beings were rare in Hell.

Artificially raised ghosts, though, were inferior to naturally formed ones from Hell's accumulated energy. They also lacked intelligence and couldn't transform into human forms. Unlike Wu Mian, who wasn't a ghost cultivator but was nearly indistinguishable from one.

Hell was a chaotic mix, with great conflicts among the Eight Great Kings and even the Ten Kings of Hell. Some were ghosts, others ghost cultivators.

"Unfortunately, this jade slip only records how to raise a True Immortal Early-stage ghost," Luo Tian muttered, then took up Luo Chen's identity token.

"Brother, rest in peace. If I have the chance, I'll avenge you; after all, I've taken your Feeding Ghosts Technique," Luo Tian dug a hole and buried the corpse.

"But now comes the real challenge—this is Hell, and any ghost cultivator who sees me will recognize I'm a disciple of Bountiful Heaven City! Even with the Thousand Mirage Mask, it's no use!" He then frowned, his eyes filled with bitterness.

"The Thousand Mirage Mask hasn't failed; Immortal Realm disciples can't see my face, but why does it fail against Hell's ghost cultivators?" Luo Tian retrieved the mask and pondered.

Luo Tian dared not leave; if he did, ghost cultivators would hunt him down. Though he had some strength, he knew Hell wasn't short of powerful beings.

But when Luo Tian saw the faintly glowing Thousand Mirage Mask, he had an insight.

Though weak, the mask radiated faint spiritual energy, clashing with the surrounding cold ghostly energy.

"I see now—it's the resonance!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with excitement, then extended his hand. Eight-colored flames shot from it, enveloping the mask.

Luo Tian wasn't a cultivator of artifacts but had spent time with Lu Chong. He could at least perform basic refinement. Now, he aimed to completely refine the spiritual energy within the Thousand Mirage Mask.

As Luo Tian refined the mask, three figures stood outside the forest he occupied.

"Are you sure this little rat has fled here?" A middle-aged man's face was cold, his body radiating killing intent but with a hint of fear.

Three figures stood outside the forest, not daring to enter immediately. They had been ordered to kill Luo Chen; originally twenty people, but Luo Chen had killed over ten with his tricks.

"That little rat should be severely wounded and dying," one said.

"He's also out of ghosts!" They exchanged words, though wary, they entered the forest to search for Luo Chen.

As they just stepped into the forest, Luo Tian completed refining the Thousand Mirage Mask; wisps of black mist surrounded it.

"This should work now!" Luo Tian's face lit up, placing the mask on his face, transforming into a youthful appearance—Luo Chen's.

"Luo Chen!" As Luo Tian completed the transformation, a startled voice echoed in his ears, making him slightly stunned.

Chapter 2063: Ghost Condensation

Luo Tian was startled, gazing at the three middle-aged men with fierce eyes. Yet upon hearing them call his name, he felt a slight joy.

They were ghost cultivators with True Immortal Early-stage power; two were Half-True Immortal. They hadn't recognized Luo Tian's true face, mistaking him for Luo Chen—clearly the Thousand Mirage Mask had worked.

"Little rat, now I'll see where you run..." As Luo Tian marveled, the three flew forward, attacking him. One spat out black mist forming a ghostly face to swallow him; the other two wielded long swords, their blades black and attacking.

Though their attacks were formidable, Luo Tian's current power was no match for them. Though he still had injuries, he hadn't recovered to avoid attracting the True Immortal Trial.

Yet even injured, they were beneath his notice. He punched, doubling his physical strength.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

Three explosions echoed; the ghostly face and two Half-True Immortal's sword attacks were all shattered by Luo Tian's punch.

After dispersing their attack, Luo Tian took a step forward, instantly appearing before the True Immortal Early-stage man. He pressed his hand down.

A pressure wave surged, a true Immortal's suppression instantly falling on the man, making his face pale. He felt as if trapped in a blizzard, frozen in place.

Terrifying—earlier in the hall, Luo Tian's pressure had pressured those inside, but they were all stronger than him. The effect wasn't obvious.

Now this True Immortal Early-stage man, a regular one, was suppressed by fifty percent of his power!

Luo Tian pressed his hand down; the man's body exploded into a mist of blood. The two Half-True Immortal men couldn't speak, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were a god.

"How strong is this Luo Chen? He was only at the Heavenly Immortal Mid-stage!"

"He killed our leader with one punch! Is he a True Immortal Mid-stage?!" Their minds screamed, eyes filled with terror.

Luo Tian grabbed a gray soul, which shrieked in his hand. "Spare me! I'm from the Luo Family!" The soul cried, but it was futile. Luo Tian frowned slightly and didn't kill the man's soul but took it instead.

Then he turned his gaze to the two Half-True Immortal men, extending his hand. Two black spiritual dragon seals shot from it, instantly wrapping the two who stood frozen in place.

The black spiritual dragons entered their bodies, coiling around their dantians and siphoning their cultivation into a black demon seed. The two men's eyes filled with terror.

The Mind-Seed Demon Art—Luo Tian hadn't used it in a long time, as he'd faced only high-level opponents without opportunity.

"My cultivation..." They gazed at Luo Tian, who seemed like a devil to them. His methods were beyond their comprehension.

"Speak! Who are you? And who sent you?" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his aura radiating an invisible pressure.

"Luo Chen Senior..."

"You still don't know who wanted you dead? The entire Luo Family might be the only one in the dark!" One man spoke, their lives now in Luo Tian's hands.

"It was your beloved Senior Brother Luo Bai!"

"Luo Bai pretended to be a kind elder brother before you, but as your talent emerged, he feared you'd steal his position. So he sent us to ambush you while you were out!"

"For years, Luo Bai's actions caused your exclusion from the family. Most of it was due to Luo Bai." The man spoke, recounting the events.

Luo Chen was a junior member; despite his humility, he faced family exclusion because anyone close to him would be punished by Luo Bai.

Luo Bai had always appeared as a kind elder brother, defending Luo Chen from bullies—yet this was all orchestrated by Luo Bai.

Brothers and a protective elder brother, Luo Chen naturally felt close to Luo Bai, even sharing his Feeding Ghosts Technique with him.

But this technique revealed Luo Chen's talent, and although he was only at Heavenly Immortal Mid-stage, his ghost-taming ability was exceptional. Thus, Luo Bai killed him.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with killing intent; Luo Bai's actions enraged him. He extended his hand, extracting the gray soul and probing it. The man's soul immediately weakened.

In the man's memories, Luo Tian learned details matching their previous accounts. Yet in his mind was an even more infuriating truth:

Luo Chen had been born with a thousand ghosts guarding his body, their forms becoming his meridians. His cultivation speed was terrifying.

But Luo Bai's mother had secretly sought help from her family to extract Luo Chen's ghost meridians, transferring them to Luo Bai.

This was done secretly; the man had stumbled upon it by chance and survived only after swearing loyalty to Luo Bai.

"Monsters!" Luo Tian's killing intent surged, crushing the man's soul and ending his life. The man had done many evil deeds for Luo Bai over the years.

"Mercy! Senior Brother, mercy!" The remaining two Half-True Immortal men fell to their knees, bowing repeatedly.

"Would you rather live or die?" Luo Tian's eyes were stern as he looked at them, forming a plan.

"Live! Senior Brother, we want to live!" Their faces lit with hope; this question meant they had a chance.

"Take these two pills!" Luo Tian smiled, extending his hand to send them into their mouths.

"Yes!" They didn't hesitate, swallowing the pills immediately. Though they had the Mind-Seed Demon Art, Luo Tian wasn't fully confident; if he activated it, these two could be killed.

"Good, return and stay in the Luo Family normally. How you explain it is up to you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, trusting they knew what to do.

"Yes! Yes!" They nodded quickly, their voices respectful. They wanted to leave the forest.

"These two pills can let you enter the True Immortal stage. Future tasks for me might be easier!" After a slap, a sweet treat was given—Luo Tian had mastered these methods.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Their eyes lit with joy, grabbing the pills immediately. They knew their fate and didn't hesitate to accept them.

"Good, I like smart people!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with a smile, waving them away from the forest.

"The Luo Family of the Three Great Families... it's also my surname! As one of the Three Great Families, they should know about the Mother of Biyanghua, right?" Luo Tian mused internally, forming a plan.

"Luo Chen, we share the same surname and gave me the Feeding Ghosts Technique. Though you're dead, from today on, you are my brother Luo Tian. I'll avenge your grudge! In Hell, I am you, Luo Chen!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with intensity as he sat cross-legged.

Luo Tian didn't rush to become a True Immortal but began studying the Feeding Ghosts Technique left by Luo Chen.

Feeding ghosts—first, condense a ghost! To raise a ghost, one must first create one. This method was unfamiliar to Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian extended his hand, a black figure appearing before him—this was the Ghost King from the Dragon Tomb.

As his cultivation increased, he hadn't used it before. Also, he had used two of the three life-saving methods.

The Ghost King appeared and trembled slightly, sensing the thick ghostly energy in the world. His black eyes glowed with excitement.

"Free you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the Ghost King and fulfilling his promise.

"Thank you..." The Ghost King spoke softly, his voice awkward as he soared into the air, letting out a cry before flying toward the forest's edge.

Watching the Ghost King leave, Luo Tian grabbed, sending a suction force from his hand. Flame colors also appeared in his hand.

"Refine Ghosts!" The suction force continued, black mist gathering in his hands.

Ghostly energy increased; after half an hour, a black ghost pearl appeared in his hand.

Eight-colored flames wrapped the black ghost pearl, hovering in his palm. Luo Tian followed the records on the jade slip to condense a ghost.

"I wonder what I'll create..." Luo Tian's eyes glowed with anticipation, as the quality of the ghost depended on the condenser's cultivation. The higher the level, the better the ghost.
