“Great Dao Sealing Demon!” After reminding Yao Chen of the demon, Luo Tian’s body radiated a true aura—this was the Immortal Ascension Scripture.

“Buddha Heaven Attack!” A series of talismans burst forth from Luo Tian’s body, wrapping around his arms. He unleashed all his strength, charging at the War King Puppet again. He knew defeating a准王 (Semi-King) puppet was no easy task.

“Kill!” Yao Chen and Long Jie attacked again, joining Luo Tian in battling the War King Puppet. The hall was soon filled with thunderous echoes.

This time, it was Luo Tian and his two companions who subdued the War King Puppet. Even if the puppet was strong and experienced, it could not match the combined might of three masters—after all, it was merely a puppet crafted by the War King himself.

“An abnormal puppet met three abnormalities!” Diao Dezhu and others marveled at the relentless attacks on the War King Puppet. Few in the Nine Realms could achieve such feats.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The thunderous sounds never ceased. Before Luo Tian, countless white fists materialized, each striking the War King Puppet’s body with precision. The puppet was utterly suppressed, finally crashing into the hall’s wall with a resounding thud.

“Peng…” The golden body collided with the hall, then slowly descended to the ground, emitting a dull sound.

“Exhilarating!” Luo Tian, Yao Chen, and Long Jie panted heavily, gazing at the fallen War King Puppet.

At that moment, the golden puppet’s body was riddled with dents, its golden light dimmed.

“Success?” Long Jie wiped blood from his lips, eyes scanning the fallen golden puppet with caution. Though it seemed defeated, their battle had also left them wounded. Long Jie felt utterly drained.

“It’s not over yet!” A low voice echoed from the puppet, as divine laws flickered across its body.

“Creak… creak…” Under everyone’s eyes, the golden puppet rose again, restored to its former glory. Its golden eyes locked onto Luo Tian and his companions.

“Now, it begins!” The War King’s voice echoed as golden talismans flowed across the puppet.

“Feng Wang Zhan Fa!” A low voice resonated from the puppet’s body, and a golden light flashed. The golden figure instantly appeared before Luo Tian, launching a powerful punch toward him.

Chapter 1570: Are You Certain?

Too fast—Luo Tian barely reacted. The War King Puppet’s speed exceeded even the limits of an epoch peak.

“Crack…” The golden fist struck Luo Tian’s chest, sending him flying backward and crashing into the hall. His chest caved inward.

“This body still isn’t enough! If I were at my peak, my speed would be faster!” The War King Puppet muttered, scanning Yao Chen and Long Jie.

“Damn it! It wasn’t supposed to use epoch power!” Diao Dezhu and others gaped, eyes wide with disbelief.

“He didn’t use epoch power—he relied solely on the puppet’s physical strength!” Yao Chen’s eyes flashed with divine light, a rare expression of admiration.

“Exactly. This is my method—after years of combat experience, I’ve developed a martial technique you could call a body art!” The War King’s voice carried pride as he addressed Luo Tian and his companions. He then leaped, becoming a golden light before Yao Chen.

“Hum…” The golden fist shot toward Yao Chen like a brilliant meteor.

“I’m not here to lose!” Yao Chen’s eyes glowed gold, catching a glimpse of the War King’s fist. His body tensed instinctively, launching a golden punch in return.

“Crack…” The thunderous clash echoed again. Yao Chen was sent flying, his arm shattering as he crashed into the hall.

“Not only has its speed increased, but so has its strength! Without using epoch power, how did it achieve this?” Yao Chen’s face showed terror as blood trickled from his mouth.

“Abnormal! I’ve never seen Luo Tian lose in a physical battle before!” Diao Dezhu and others wore expressions of shock. The War King had turned the impossible into reality.

“How did he do it? Without epoch power, he made Luo Tian look so helpless! I remember Luo Tian’s physical strength was always his advantage in fighting!” Zheng Xin and others wore worried expressions.

After defeating Yao Chen, the War King Puppet showed no hesitation, leaping into Long Jie’s path.

Though Long Jie was prepared, he still took the hit, crashing into the hall’s wall.

“Cough… cough…” Long Jie spat blood, his face equally stunned.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at the War King Puppet. This was his first encounter with such an opponent. Though their combined physical strength could subdue a Semi-King, the puppet’s sudden surge had left Luo Tian momentarily stunned.

“Powerful War King!” Luo Tian muttered, slowly rising as white light radiated from his body. His caved chest gradually recovered.

Yao Chen and Long Jie also rose, standing beside Luo Tian as they cautiously eyed the War King Puppet.

“You may leave. You cannot defeat me yet!” The War King Puppet spoke softly, its voice laced with disdain.

“You increased the difficulty,” Luo Tian replied, his gaze unyielding. “If a regular divine being had come, defeating your current state would have been enough. But since we’re not divine beings, you’ve raised the stakes.”

“Correct,” Luo Tian added. “What difference does it make? Even if you use epoch power, you still can’t defeat me!” The War King Puppet spoke again.

“Can you two fight on?” Luo Tian smiled, ignoring the War King’s words and addressing Long Jie and Yao Chen.

“I can’t win, but I can still fight!” Yao Chen admitted bluntly, scowling as he eyed the War King Puppet.

“Save your strength. I’ll lower the difficulty a bit!” Luo Tian smiled, stepping forward between them.

“Today, I claim this broken puppet!” Luo Tian declared loudly, his gaze locked on the War King Puppet.

“Then show your skills!” The War King’s voice carried disdain as it transformed into a golden light, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Come on!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet energy as he retreated, launching a punch that collided with the War King Puppet.

This time, Luo Tian was not so helpless; he smiled as their fists clashed, the shockwave swirling around his robes.

“Zhen Hun!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold as an invisible wave surged through their clashing fists, entering the War King Puppet’s body.

“Ah…” A pained scream echoed from the golden puppet, leaving everyone puzzled.

“This… is the power of a Soul-Subduing Master!” The group realized Luo Tian’s technique.

“I see! Luo Tian directly eliminated the War King’s residual soul within the puppet!”

“Without the War King’s soul, this Semi-King-level puppet is just a lifeless construct. Without its terrifying combat techniques and the War King’s fearsome battle awareness, it will be crushed by Luo Tian’s trio!” Diao Dezhu and others instantly understood Luo Tian’s plan.

“Damn it! That’s cheating! How could you have such a technique!” The War King’s soul cried out within the puppet.

“No choice, but you’re not the real one. You’re just a fragment of a soul. This puppet isn’t your body, so it will always be under my control!” Luo Tian smiled.

“Besides, this is merely one of my methods—it’s not cheating!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his hand clenching. The War King’s soul within the puppet went silent.

“Tread… tread… tread…” Luo Tian retreated, and the golden puppet did too, its eyes clouded.

“Hum…” The puppet had barely retreated when it rushed toward Luo Tian again, but its speed was far slower than before.

“Now it’s easier,” Luo Tian smiled, his body darting toward the mechanical puppet. Yao Chen and Long Jie attacked in tandem, subduing the puppet once more.

Without the War King’s soul, defeating a puppet relying solely on instinct was simple for Luo Tian and his companions.

An hour later, the golden puppet was again smashed into the hall, but this time it never rose.

“How do we fix this thing?” Diao Dezhu and others gathered around the damaged puppet, their faces puzzled.

“My…” Sun Kain ignored everything, seizing the opportunity to claim anything valuable. He reached for the puppet before Zheng Xin kicked him.

“You’ve already taken enough! You benefited plenty here!”

“Exactly! What does this puppet have to do with you? You should thank Luo Tian and his companions. Otherwise, you might still be kicked around—and even exploded!” Diao Dezhu and others chimed in.

Luo Tian, Yao Chen, and Long Jie smiled as they subdued the puppet. Their minds now contained methods to restore it.

Three divine souls radiated from their bodies, entering the puppet.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s mind filled with images of a golden figure performing strange movements. Though initially confusing, he soon understood:

“Feng Wang Zhan Fa!” Luo Tian, Long Jie, and Yao Chen spoke in unison, their eyes alight with excitement.

“Is that the body art technique the War King used to enhance his strength?” Diao Dezhu and others’ faces changed. They had witnessed the War King Puppet’s power firsthand, even overwhelming Luo Tian and his companions.

As their divine souls entered the puppet, it radiated golden light, beginning to self-repair.

Soon, Luo Tian and his companions opened their eyes, awestruck.

“Hmph! This body art technique is perfect for me!” Yao Chen grinned, thrilled by the combat-oriented method.

“This is truly a powerful technique!” Luo Tian and Long Jie smiled, their expressions showing the method’s benefits.

“Give me this puppet! I’ll use it to pass the time when I can’t find a challenge!” Yao Chen addressed Luo Tian.

“Take it!” Luo Tian didn’t refuse. After all, it wasn’t for outsiders. Giving it to Yao Chen might ease their troubles—Yao Chen would stop constantly seeking fights with them.

“Little Master, can I enter this puppet?” A voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, a weathered tone laced with flattery. Luo Tian’s expression slightly stiffened.

“Are you sure?” Luo Tian’s lips curled, his gaze playful.

Chapter 1571: Activating the Soul Prison

“Sure, Little Master! I’ve been obedient and diligent for you all these years. Let me have a body. I promise to serve you faithfully, even risking my life!” The voice echoed again in Luo Tian’s mind.

The speaker was Gu Yongkang, the epoch peak soul Luo Tian had captured in the Chaos Holy Palace. He had once shielded Luo Tian from many crises, but after Luo Tian’s growth, Gu Yongkang had remained unused.

“Fine, I’ll grant you this,” Luo Tian spoke softly, not fearing Gu Yongkang’s betrayal.

Not only was Gu Yongkang’s soul still under Luo Tian’s control, but the restrictions he had placed on it ensured Gu Yongkang would never betray him.

“Thank you, Little Master!” The voice carried joy as Luo Tian sent Gu Yongkang outside the hall. A gray soul appeared in front of them.

“Is this the soul Luo Tian summoned?” Diao Dezhu and others recognized it immediately, their faces puzzled.

“Go!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the respectful Gu Yongkang’s soul. He gestured, and waves of energy surged. Gu Yongkang’s soul merged with the puppet.

Golden light flashed, and the golden puppet regained its vitality—stronger than before when the War King’s soul resided in it. After all, the War King had only used a fragment of his soul, while Gu Yongkang was a complete epoch peak soul.

“Thank you, Little Master! I’ll serve you with my life!” The golden puppet spoke loudly. Gu Yongkang realized he wasn’t simply inhabiting the puppet but was semi-fused with it.

“From now on, your master is him!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the puppet. He pointed at Yao Chen—Luo Tian had previously promised to give the puppet to him.

“This soul must have been cursed in its past life—just out of one trap, into another…” Diao Dezhu and others looked at the golden puppet with pity.

Yao Chen’s nature was known to them; this puppet would become his training dummy.

Yao Chen’s eyes glowed gold, a smile on his face. Fighting a puppet alone was too dull. From the moment Gu Yongkang’s soul appeared, Yao Chen sensed his strength—having such a powerful opponent was exactly what he desired.

“Thanks!” Yao Chen didn’t hesitate, grabbing Gu Yongkang and flying toward the War King’s tomb.

“We should go too!” Luo Tian looked at the empty hall, knowing Sun Kain had already taken everything before they arrived. There was no need to stay.

They nodded, exiting the War King’s tomb. Luo Tian and Sun Mengru returned to the hall, while Sun Kain continued exploring the Divine King’s Cemetery.

As Luo Tian and his group left, the divine beings fully restored their domain. When they saw Yao Chen no longer challenging them to duels, the divine beings were relieved.

But when they saw Yao Chen constantly battling a powerful puppet, the divine beings felt like vomiting.

“That’s our Divine King’s tomb! That’s a puppet crafted by the War King using his life’s effort and wealth!” The divine beings recognized the items in the War King’s tomb. After all, there were few Semi-Empire Master tombs across the divine realm. However, they dared to be angry but not speak out, only cursing silently.

The divine beings gradually returned to normal, yet they longed for the “plague” of these four to leave quickly. Otherwise, perhaps their entire divine realm would be emptied by these “plagues.”

Time passed slowly. Nearly a month later, Luo Tian fully recovered. Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong appeared in the hall with bloodshot eyes.

“How is it?” Luo Tian smiled, asking Jiang Nanxuan directly.

“Don’t worry! With us two, nothing is impenetrable. Given enough time, even the Soul Prison isn’t a problem!” Wan Lingkong spoke before Jiang Nanxuan could, his face full of confidence. However, Luo Tian ignored him—Wan Lingkong had a history of being unreliable.

“An 80% chance, but I need your help!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face was calm despite the bloodshot eyes. His aura remained unchanged.

“80%!” Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Luo Tian felt a slight joy. He knew Jiang Nanxuan well—when he said 80%, it was nearly certain.

“Rest for two days, then we’ll go again!” Luo Tian said, observing their states.

“No need! The War King must be suffering inside! The sooner the better!” Jiang Nanxuan shook his head, then left the hall.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian nodded, following Jiang Nanxuan and Sun Mengru outside the Soul Prison.

“We’ve studied for days and found a weak spot in this door—probably from someone breaking out before!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Someone broke out from inside?” Luo Tian and Sun Mengru looked puzzled. Normally, breaking out required surpassing a Semi-King’s strength.

“Yes, but we suspect the one who broke out didn’t need much strength. The Soul Prison likely bound its prisoners, so they weren’t free. The one who broke out might have been a divine being themselves. If you hadn’t been bound, you could’ve broken through too!” Jiang Nanxuan explained.

“Regardless, it’s a good thing!” Luo Tian nodded. Whether the one who broke out was someone or not, freeing Chen Zhanbiao from the Soul Prison was a good thing. As for who it was, Luo Tian no longer cared.

“We’ll set up a formation to boost your soul power. You need to gather strong soul energy to break through the weak spot!” Jiang Nanxuan said.

“As for where it is, the formation will guide you,” Wan Lingkong added.

“Okay!” Luo Tian didn’t argue, nodding. He was confident in his soul control.

“Start!” Seeing Luo Tian’s nod, Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong waved their hands. Countless formation flags flew from their hands, landing outside the Soul Prison’s door. Luo Tian stepped into the formation.

Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong spent half an hour setting up the formation, their current cultivation levels requiring such effort. This showed how complex the formation was.

“Ready! It’s starting!” Jiang Nanxuan said solemnly, then waved his hands. Two formation flags were planted into the ground.

“Hum…” The humming echoed, waves radiating from each golden flag. However, the flags suddenly turned black like ink.

“Roar…” Roars echoed as dark figures emerged from the flags, swirling around Luo Tian’s head. Their faces were grotesque.

“Soul Blade!” Luo Tian gazed at the ghost-like figures, his face calm. He split a third of his soul into a gray soul blade, which hovered above him.

“Roar…” As the soul blade materialized, the dark figures seemed drawn to it, rushing toward the blade.

The humming echoed through heaven and earth. The dark figures vanished into the gray soul blade, making it even more solid.

“Ten… a hundred… ten thousand…” A total of 99,999 dark figures entered the soul blade. It radiated brilliant light, like a supreme sword.

After the dark figures entered the soul blade, Luo Tian’s face showed shock. His soul felt unusually powerful—this blade alone could slay any enemy.

“There!” Luo Tian found the weak spot in the Soul Prison’s door, as Jiang Nanxuan said. He smiled and pointed his finger.

“Go…” The gray soul blade transformed into a streak of gray light, striking the weak spot on the golden door.

“Crack…” In an instant, the gray soul blade pierced the golden door with flowing light.

“Cough… cough…” However, after this collision, Luo Tian’s face turned pale.

Gray mist spread, covering the golden door. Luo Tian’s expression was grim, his gaze deepening.

The gray blade returned to Luo Tian’s head, and the spot it struck left only a mark.

“Not enough!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness, commanding the soul blade to strike his own soul.

The gray soul blade cut through Luo Tian’s soul, severing half of it. Sweat dripped from his face as the gray soul entered the blade under his control. With a hum, it flew toward the golden door.

“Explosive!” The soul blade collided with the golden door, and a terrifying explosion echoed across the divine mountain.

Invisible waves spread outward, overwhelming the divine beings on the mountain with soul pressure.

“Is it opening the Soul Prison?” Diao Dezhu and others heard the thunderous sound, emerging from the Divine King’s Cemetery.

“Too terrifying! Even a soul could crush us all!” The divine beings trembled, gazing at the Soul Prison with reverence.

Furious waves swept outward, and the thunderous sound was overwhelming. This time, Luo Tian self-destructed most of his soul, finally cracking the door at a visible speed.

“Crack…” Cracks spread across the golden door, then transformed into divine laws, scattering in Luo Tian’s group’s sight.

“Hurry and save Zhanbiao! This door won’t stay open for long!” Jiang Nanxuan, pale-faced, urged Diao Dezhu and others.

“Okay!” They didn’t hesitate, rushing into the Soul Prison and vanishing from Luo Tian’s group.

“Plop…” Luo Tian fell to the ground, panting heavily. This soul destruction was weaker than when he saved Fu Xingxuan. After cutting off a third initially, then half of his soul, he was exhausted.

“How are you?” Sun Mengru’s face showed concern as she appeared before Luo Tian, asking.

“Fine!” Luo Tian smiled, his gaze weak. His powerful soul was severely wounded, and the curse power surged again, causing him pain.

Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong also had sweat on their brows; the formation had drained them too.

While recovering, they waited for Diao Dezhu and others to emerge from the Soul Prison.

Time passed slowly. The divine laws floating in the air began to coalesce, but Diao Dezhu and others still hadn’t emerged.

“Hum…” The humming echoed as the divine laws coalesced, and a golden door’s image appeared in Luo Tian’s group.

“Ding…” The Purple Bamboo Zither appeared before Jiang Nanxuan, its melody echoing across the divine mountain. A calm atmosphere radiated from the music, slowing the golden door’s rapid coalescence.

“What are they doing in there? It’s taking so long!” Luo Tian looked worried, gazing at the Soul Prison emitting golden divine light.

After another hour, breaking sounds echoed from within the Soul Prison. Diao Dezhu and others finally emerged.

“Huff…” Luo Tian’s group sighed deeply. Though Jiang Nanxuan said breaking out was easier, it was only a possibility.

As they exited the Soul Prison, Jiang Nanxuan’s zither music stopped, and the golden door resealed.

“They’re out! This place isn’t for humans!” The group’s faces showed fear upon exiting.

“Where is Zhanbiao?” Luo Tian asked, scanning them but not seeing Chen Zhanbiao. His heart worried.

“They saved him!” Xu Liyi’s face showed coldness, waving his hand to reveal a figure before Luo Tian—Chen Zhanbiao.

However, Chen Zhanbiao was in a pitiful state—his once strong body had withered slightly, his skin marked by wounds. The wounds glowed with divine laws, and waves of refinement power radiated from them.

“Big brother…” Chen Zhanbiao, though in terrible condition, recognized Luo Tian. His eyes were weak, his lips twitched into a familiar, somewhat foolish smile—yet to them, it was more painful than crying.

“We found Zhanbiao trapped and his cultivation sealed. His body was locked by a divine chain, constantly refining him!” Xu Liyi’s eyes were red with anger.

“But I’m curious—why didn’t they kill Zhanbiao?” Zheng Xin and others, though filled with rage, hadn’t lost their minds.

“They wanted to subdue him and another soul for possession! Finally, something went wrong!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke weakly. Though somewhat foolish, he wasn’t a fool.

“Zhanbiao, I’ll avenge this for you!” Luo Tian’s heart burned with fury. Though weak, his body radiated coldness.

“But… Big brother, I’m so hungry! I haven’t eaten in days!” Chen Zhanbiao whined pitifully.

“Haha! You still remember to eat!” Zheng Xin and others’ grim faces lightened.

“Don’t just stand there! Go prepare food for us—plenty of it!” Xu Liyi shouted at the surrounding divine beings. This was the first time Chen Zhanbiao had suffered so much.

Though they couldn’t find Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wuwei, and the soul trying to possess Chen Zhanbiao, they redirected their anger toward the divine beings.

“Yes… yes…” Seeing Luo Tian’s group had no major issues, the divine beings sighed in relief. They feared for Chen Zhanbiao’s safety and vented their anger on the divine beings.

“By the way, we found two more people in the Soul Prison, which delayed us a bit. How should we handle them?” Zheng Xin and others asked again, waving their hands to reveal two figures before Luo Tian’s group.

These two were even more pitiful than Chen Zhanbiao—thin, like bones wrapped in skin. Their bodies radiated weakness, as if about to collapse.

“Old Divine King, Sun Shengtian?” Luo Tian recognized them after careful observation—both were barely recognizable.

“It’s our old Divine King!” The divine beings’ faces showed shock, carefully identifying Sun Shengtian.

“Of course! We couldn’t find the old Divine King and new Divine King—this is why they were locked in the Soul Prison!”

“Beasts!” The divine beings erupted, cursing Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wuwei.

“But why does the other one look so different from Shen Chen Divine King?” They then gazed at another weak figure, their faces puzzled.

“It’s Sun Feiwen!” Sun Mengru sighed deeply, approaching the weak figure and giving it a pill.

“It’s him!” Luo Tian and his group sighed, their eyes filled with admiration.

Sun Feiwen, once a divine prince of the divine realm, held high status and was one of the few who treated Sun Mengru kindly—besides the late Grand Elder.

However, after the emergence of the immortal body Sun Chenchen, Sun Feiwen’s light dimmed and he gradually faded from view.

“Where is Sun Chenchen?” The group asked, puzzled. Normally, if Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen were in the Soul Prison, Sun Chenchen should be there too.

“We searched but couldn’t find him!” Diao Dezhu and others shook their heads, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Should we kill them? If they recover, they might still threaten the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Their faces showed killing intent as they gazed at Luo Tian, awaiting his decision.

Hearing their words, the divine beings tensed. Their current strength had diminished; they hadn’t a peak epoch cultivator. They had just found Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen, and if they recovered, they might restore some of the divine realm’s strength.

“Please don’t! We swear we’ll never oppose the Four Sacred Star Domains again. Please spare the old Divine King and prince!” The divine beings fell to their knees, gazing at Luo Tian. Now the divine realm was in danger; Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen were their last hope.

“Fine, let’s save them!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Sun Feiwen had a connection with Sun Mengru, so he must be saved. And Sun Shengtian was someone who understood reason in Luo Tian’s eyes. Plus, he no longer feared Sun Shengtian.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, they had no objections. They gave pills to Sun Shengtian and waited for him to awaken.

A thick vitality of herbs flowed through their bodies, and within moments, they opened their eyes—still weak but with a glimmer of light.

“Old Divine King, it’s been a while!” Luo Tian, his face pale, smiled at Sun Shengtian.

“Luo Tian!” Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen spoke in unison, their eyes filled with admiration. If they had known before, they would never have believed Luo Tian would save them.

“Rest first. It’s not the time to talk!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, as their states were poor.

“Hmm…” Sun Shengtian nodded, his body seeming older after the ordeal. He had clearly endured much.

Chapter 1572: Departing for the Shura Domain

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian’s group continued resting in the divine realm. However, Diao Dezhu and others didn’t return to the Divine King’s Tomb; Sun Kain said good things should be opened slowly.

But Zheng Xin and others knew Sun Kain was afraid of Sun Shengtian’s revenge. After all, they had taken many good things before.

After Jiang Nanxuan helped open the Soul Prison and recovered, he returned to the Four Sacred Star Domains. Without Luo Tian, someone had to manage it. Long Jie also returned to the Demon Domain and didn’t stay long.

The divine realm briefly regained peace, letting them breathe a sigh of relief. Yet they remained cautious, carefully serving Luo Tian’s group.

Two months passed, and Luo Tian recovered significantly. He slowly stepped out of the closed room prepared by the divine realm.

“Full!” Chen Zhanbiao had recovered nearly a month earlier, and that month was the happiest for him. The divine realm prepared exquisite meals daily, allowing him to feast.
