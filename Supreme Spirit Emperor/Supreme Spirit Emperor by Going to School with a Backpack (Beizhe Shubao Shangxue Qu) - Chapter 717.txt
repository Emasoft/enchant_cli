“If we add the attacking army from the Immortal Realm, a total of twenty million elite warriors, even if we are fully prepared, we still cannot withstand it!” Diao Dezhu's heart was anxious. He transformed into a purple line, desperately trying to send the news back to Tianyuan Sect.

...

On another front, Luo Tian and Yao Chen continuously unleashed attacks. The entire world turned dark.

For the Hell Army, today was as if the end of days. Luo Tian and Yao Chen had already joined forces with two Yellow Spring Soldiers.

After three days and nights of battle, Luo Tian and Yao Chen were covered in blood, their bodies riddled with wounds. The two Yellow Spring Soldiers' aura had also dimmed significantly, clearly exhausted.

Opposite them stood countless black figures. The ground was littered with corpses and rivers of blood flowed. Though there were millions, their faces bore terror as they gazed at Luo Tian and Yao Chen.

After three days and nights, the Hell side suffered heavy losses. Five Late-stage Immortal Kings fell, leaving only one Mid-stage Immortal King and three Early-stage Immortal Kings. The disciples and soldiers had also suffered countless casualties.

"Run!" Someone shouted, breaking the silence of the battlefield. A wave of figures rushed outward.

"Run..." Even those Late-stage Immortal Kings had been broken by Luo Tian and Yao Chen's forces, yet they did not stop the Hell Army from fleeing.

In an instant, the remaining warriors began to scatter in all directions. Even the Late-stage Immortal Kings glanced at Luo Tian before flying away.

"Kill!" Luo Tian waved the Yellow Spring Ruler, directing the remaining Yellow Spring Soldiers to pursue.

"Late-stage Immortal Kings must not be allowed to escape!" Luo Tian shouted. The weak Mid-stage Immortal King Yellow Spring Soldiers rushed after the fleeing Late-stage Immortal Kings.

Luo Tian withdrew the Sinful Mirror, without hesitation. Five beams of annihilating light shot out from it, flying toward the four Late-stage Immortal Kings.

"Still more!" The four Late-stage Immortal Kings' faces showed terror. Instantly, they felt their bodies locked by a terrifying aura.

Pupu... Pupu... Four bursts of blood mist rose. The four Late-stage Immortal Kings, already severely wounded, were annihilated by the annihilating light in the sky.

"Terrifying!" The only ones who remained still were the Turn Wheel Hall members. Their eyes trembled as they witnessed this battle, watching hundreds of thousands slaughtered without mercy.

As the Turn Wheel Hall members were stunned, two Yellow Spring Soldiers at their peak returned. They transformed into yellow spring water and returned to the Yellow Spring Ruler. The two Yellow Spring Soldiers had also completely exterminated the remaining Immortal King-level masters.

"Total defeat! Two people were so terrifying! Who could dare provoke Tianyuan Sect? If this news spreads, the several Celestial Lords would surely not send reinforcements!" Jueying Celestial Lord sighed in silence. This achievement was truly shocking, even for him with his long years of experience.

Chapter 2708: Golden Armor and Iron Horses Descend Upon Tianyuan

Hundreds of thousands scattered like birds, the ground covered with corpses. Blood dyed the earth red. Luo Tian and Yao Chen stood atop the sky, transformed into two bloodied figures, breathing heavily.

After so many days of battle, even Luo Tian and Yao Chen felt exhausted. If it weren't for their willpower, they might have collapsed.

Huala... The yellow spring water flowed back into the Yellow Spring Ruler. The Yellow Spring Ruler lost its former divine laws. Luo Tian and Yao Chen fell to the ground with a plop.

Luo Tian and Yao Chen exchanged glances before laughing aloud. They supported each other to stand, gazing at those who had not yet fully dispersed.

Yao Chen sighed. He naturally loved battle, and after reaching this level, though exhausted, he felt completely at ease.

"Quickly recover your injuries. There's still a major battle ahead!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Jueying Celestial Lord who was approaching.

"Senior Disciple!" Jueying Celestial Lord bowed to Luo Tian, his eyes filled with admiration. Even now, he had to look up at Luo Tian. Killing nine Late-stage Immortal Kings—such an achievement, only a Peak-level Immortal King could accomplish.

"Respected Elder, you should take another route back. If others see you, it would be inconvenient." Luo Tian smiled and bowed to Jueying Celestial Lord.

"Good. Take care!" Jueying Celestial Lord did not linger, immediately leading the Turn Wheel Hall members toward Hell.

As the Turn Wheel Hall members left, Luo Tian and Yao Chen sat amidst corpses, beginning to recover their injuries.

"I wonder how Tianyuan Sect is doing," Luo Tian sighed. He was still concerned; both he and Yao Chen's injuries were severe, not recoverable in a short time. Moreover, the Yellow Spring Ruler could no longer be used after this battle. Luo Tian's reserves were limited. Late-stage Immortal Kings were manageable, but if an Peak-level Immortal King arrived, with the Sinful Mirror and the Heaven-Healing Stone, Luo Tian believed he could barely cope. He feared if several Peak-level Immortal Kings joined forces, even he would be unable to handle them. Several Peak-level Immortal Kings were beyond his ability.

"Don't worry..." Yao Chen spoke, and the two fell into silence, continuously consuming pills to recover their injuries.

Time passed slowly. Seven days had gone by. The corpses around them emitted a pungent smell, and Luo Tian and Yao Chen had recovered seven-tenths of their injuries.

"Let's go. With our speed, we can reach Tianyuan Sect in two days. We should still make it!" The two leapt into the air, flying toward Tianyuan Sect.

...

Tianyuan Sect was filled with tension. A group of disciples stood on Tianyuan Mountain, gazing toward the direction of Bountiful Heaven City.

"Almost there!" Jiang Sxi wore golden armor, holding a golden long sword. Her presence was striking.

Behind her stood Nan Gong Yuqing, Long Jie, Diao Dezhu, and others. Their faces bore battle intent, their energy piercing the sky.

Immortal Kings...

Tianyuan Sect now had a terrifying number of Immortal Kings. Two Late-stage, fourteen Mid-stage, and six Early-stage.

Diao Dezhu had returned yesterday. Due to the speed, he arrived earlier than the Hell Army, bringing news to Tianyuan Sect.

Time passed slowly. One hour had gone by, yet Tianyuan Sect's people still waited.

In the waiting, the sky changed. A heavy pressure rose from afar. The earth trembled, and the heavens roared.

A deep sound approached from far away. A black torrent surged toward Tianyuan Sect, accompanied by roaring and battle intent, crashing against it like a mountain.

"Here they come!" Jiang Sxi and others stood solemn. Though they had weathered many storms, they felt some tension now.

Boom... As they spoke, the black torrent reached the foot of Tianyuan Sect. The color split apart, and several forces swiftly surrounded the entire Tianyuan Sect.

"Indeed elite. The weakest among them was even a True Immortal Early-stage!" Nan Gong Yuqing and others tightened their grips on their weapons.

"Tianyuan Sect, today we will destroy it!" Several figures stood at the four corners of Tianyuan Sect. Their loud voices echoed.

"Roar..." At the same time, roars echoed out. The elite of the Yama Ten Palaces looked coldly at Tianyuan Sect's people.

"What to do? This is quite tricky," Diao Dezhu and others felt a bad premonition. At this moment, Tianyuan Sect had no way out.

"Fight to the death! Who attacks first will be met with Tianyuan Sect's desperate resistance!" Jiang Sxi replied.

The Hell Army did not attack immediately. Jiang Sxi was right; they knew that whoever attacked first would face Tianyuan Sect's desperate resistance.

"Join forces?" The leaders of several forces exchanged thoughts. Finally, they decided to attack Tianyuan Sect together.

"Kill!" After reaching an agreement, several Late-stage Immortal Kings issued orders. They waved their flags, commanding the elite behind them to attack Tianyuan Sect.

Several forces heard the command and rushed toward Tianyuan Sect. Instantly, a wave of martial techniques soared into the sky.

A deep sound echoed. The entire Tianyuan Sect resounded with cries of battle, making Tianyuan Sect's people tense.

"Array!" Wan Lingkong stepped forward. His hands moved swiftly. Before the enemy could reach Tianyuan Sect, golden array flags rose from all sides of Tianyuan Sect. The array flags emitted powerful fluctuations.

A heavy pressure descended from the sky. At the same time, the Hell forces rushed into the array.

Peng... Peng... As they entered the array, the elite soldiers felt a powerful pressure and fell to the ground.

Boom... As they landed on the ground, the earth cracked open. A series of soil spikes rose and pierced the Hell soldiers.

"Damn it, Tianyuan Sect has an array master!" Several Late-stage Immortal Kings' faces turned pale. However, they hadn't reacted in time.

"Ah..." Instantly, many Yama Ten Palace soldiers were pierced through their bodies and died at the foot of Tianyuan Mountain.

But these were Yama Ten Palace elites, experienced in life-and-death battles. Many of them reacted and dodged the soil spikes. Some sustained minor injuries.

"Did you think this was all? I've prepared for two years!" Wan Lingkong smiled coldly. He held a golden command flag and continuously waved it.

Boom... As Wan Lingkong waved the array flag, a fiery heat rose from underground. A series of fire dragons instantly surged upward, burning toward the Hell forces.

"Skyfire!" Ye Fengdu's face changed. He watched the already purple flames and took a step forward, flying toward Tianyuan Sect.

Other palace's Immortal Kings also finally acted. Only they could possibly resist Wan Lingkong's array.

Chapter 2709: The Might of Tianyuan Sect

Skyfire burns the heavens. A wave of terrifying fire instantly swept across the eight directions, surrounding Tianyuan Sect.

"Ah..." Black figures were instantly annihilated by the terrifying flames.

Crack... Unknown when, a large number of heavenly thunder descended from the sky. It continuously struck the Hell's strongmen.

Damn it!

The palace leaders' faces were extremely grim. In an instant, the Hell army lost nearly a million people.

"Powerful!" Tianyuan Sect's people were invigorated. Their eyes filled with reverence as they gazed at Wan Lingkong standing there, holding the command flag.

"Who dares to destroy Tianyuan Sect? We die, but you will also lose your skin!" Wan Lingkong shouted. He bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood, turning the command flag blood-red. He continuously waved it.

Whoosh... A fierce wind swept through, fire aided by the wind, sweeping across heaven and earth to form a divine punishment.

"This skyfire came from where? You have it!" Diao Dezhu and others had joy on their faces. These two years, Wan Lingkong had been wandering around Tianyuan Mountain without rest.

Now fully unleashed, he gave the Hell army a painful blow. Several Immortal Kings finally acted. Several senior disciples and Late-stage Celestial Lords stepped through the sky, appearing outside the devastating array.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation!" Ye Qiu shouted. His absolute sword radiated divine light, cutting through the sky with a massive sword qi. He slashed toward the surging flames.

Sword intent reached heaven, splitting the sky. The absolute sword light unfolded the fire, and a series of thick fire dragons instantly shattered under Ye Qiu's sword qi.

Others also launched attacks. The sound of thunder rose around Tianyuan Sect.

"Array!" Wan Lingkong shouted, waving the blood-red array flag. His body rapidly withered, his eyes filled with madness.

"Sky collapse..."

"Earth split!" A cold and mad voice came from Wan Lingkong's mouth. The sky roared, clouds gathered.

The sky seemed to be torn by a pair of giant hands. A cold and violent energy descended, rushing toward the surroundings of Tianyuan Mountain.

Boom...

The earth began to crack. The entire world seemed like the end of days, two devastating energies colliding from the sky and ground.

Furious chaos turned into absolute killing intent. It swept through the Hell army, causing another wave of blood mist.

"This guy is too变态!" Ye Fengdu and Yin Wu's faces showed shock. They looked at Wan Lingkong on Tianyuan Mountain. Normally, they would have been very dismissive of Wan Lingkong. A Mid-stage Immortal King was not worth their attention.

But they hadn't expected this small Mid-stage Immortal King to have cultivated the array so astonishingly.

A wailing cry echoed. Another several hundred thousand Hell ghost cultivators instantly fell at the foot of Tianyuan Mountain, and the number of dead and wounded continued to increase.

"Cut... Cut... Cut..."

Nine Late-stage Immortal Kings roared. The battle had just begun, and they had already lost these people. It was beyond their expectations. More so, they were angry that Tianyuan Sect had no casualties, only the array master looking wounded.

Immortal Kings continuously launched attacks. They struck Wan Lingkong's array with powerful assaults.

An hour later, the array flags around Tianyuan Sect shattered. Wan Lingkong continuously spat blood and finally fell to the ground.

"Old Wan!" Diao Dezhu and others rushed forward, gazing at the dying Wan Lingkong with concern.

"Leave the rest to you. I'll take a nap first!" Wan Lingkong smiled, slowly closing his eyes.

"Don't sleep!" Diao Dezhu saw Wan Lingkong's condition. Without thinking, he swung his hand and slapped Wan Lingkong.

Pap... Pap...

But no matter how hard Diao Dezhu slapped Wan Lingkong, he seemed dead, his eyes closed.

"Damn you!"

"I'm just exhausted. If you keep slapping me, I'll really die!" Diao Dezhu slapped a few times. Just as Diao Dezhu's palm was about to fall again, Wan Lingkong suddenly had strength and opened his eyes. He cursed loudly before falling back down again.

Everyone glared at Diao Dezhu, then handed Wan Lingkong over to Ren Hongzhe for care. They then turned their eyes back toward the Hell army, which had broken through Wan Lingkong's array and rushed toward Tianyuan Mountain again.

"This time I'll see what you have left!" The Hell elites roared continuously. Just now, it was only one wave of attack, and Wan Lingkong's array had already killed over a million. Although the loss was distributed among each faction, each losing tens of thousands, they were elites cultivated by their respective factions. They couldn't bear this humiliation.

"Divine Bow, prepare!" Lu Chong shouted. Tianyuan Sect instantly sent out a million disciples standing at the outermost line.

Each person held a dark-colored bow and arrow. A single arrow radiated cold light, emitting an icy aura.

"Fire!"

Lu Chong issued orders. The million disciples holding the arrows moved their triggers, and a wave of light shot out from each disciple's hands.

Huala... The arrows turned into raindrops, a hundred thousand arrows flying from Tianyuan Mountain toward the Hell forces.

"What is this..." Seeing the descending arrow rain, the Yama Ten Palace's leaders' faces changed.

Pup... Pup...

They couldn't resist. The icy arrows pierced the strong bodies of the Hell elites, instantly killing a large number.

"What is this arrow? It has such power. Even True Immortals couldn't resist!" Ye Qiu and others were shocked. He grabbed an arrow in his hand.

"Millennium Cold Jade Iron! Tianyuan Sect is so rich!" Ye Qiu's eyes showed disbelief. He watched the disciples of Tianyuan Sect reloaded their arrows and flew forward, rushing to the front of the Fengdu Palace's forces.

Other faction leaders also stepped forward. They knew that only an Immortal King's domain could resist these arrows.

One by one, domains connected together. The second wave of arrow rain also descended, covering the sky.

Immortal King's domains were indeed powerful. A large number of arrow rain collided with the domains, producing a series of pungent sounds and shattering within the domain's protection.

But Immortal Kings were limited in number. They could only resist part of it, and most Hell elites were hit by the arrow rain and fell.

"Kill!" Lu Chong shouted. The million disciples shot their last arrow.

"Damn it!" The Yama Ten Palace's Immortal Kings' faces were grim. They desperately resisted, but it was of little use. After three waves of arrow rain, another hundred thousand were dead, with countless wounded.

Chapter 2710: The Harsh Battle

"Out of arrows!" Lu Chong sighed. Two years was too short. He had organized Tianyuan Sect's disciples day and night to craft a million Divine Bows and cold jade iron arrows. But these two items consumed too much, beyond what most sects could bear.

"This is Tianyuan Sect!" The Yama Ten Palace's Immortal Kings were solemn. They had thought that with the elites of the ten palaces, a small Tianyuan Sect would be easy. But they hadn't expected that Tianyuan Sect had no casualties, while they had already lost two to three million.

"This money was worth it!" Diao Dezhu and others sighed. After three waves of arrows, the Hell forces had lost nearly a million more. If it weren't for the Immortal Kings' resistance, just the array and arrows would have killed half of those Hell forces.

"But now comes the most critical part!" Jiang Sxi spoke softly, gazing at the Hell army that had reached the foot of Tianyuan Mountain.

"They must not be allowed to reach Tianyuan Mountain, for there are the elderly and children up there!" Jiang Sxi shouted. The disciples of Tianyuan Sect's faces showed madness, their battle spirit rising.

"It's too humiliating. Let us flatten Tianyuan Sect!" The Hell forces roared, their humiliation deep.

"Follow me!" Jiang Sxi waved his long sword and ascended through the sky, radiating a massive aura. He rushed toward Ye Fengdu.

"Little girl, your opponent is me!" Before Ye Fengdu could act, a figure blocked Jiang Sxi's path. His eyes glowed as he gazed at Jiang Sxi.

The Holy Son of the Tai Ping Palace, Li Yuqing!

" I heard you're Luo Tian's wife. Follow me; I'll never mistreat you!" Li Yuqing spoke, his eyes fixated on Jiang Sxi. He licked his lips.

" I heard you all were beaten by Luo Tian and couldn't get up!" Jiang Sxi's eyes flashed with killing intent. She was no one to hesitate, raising her sword and slashing toward Li Yuqing.

"I'm getting more fond of you!" Li Yuqing showed no reluctance. He held a black long sword and clashed with Jiang Sxi.

"Kill!" Wu Xingwen's hands flashed with starlight. His star sword danced, sending a massive wave of sword qi toward Tianyuan Sect's disciples.

Crash...

As the sword qi rose, a long spear swept down. The spear was decorated with stars.

"Your opponent is me!" Fu Xingyue's eyes flashed coldly. The long spear clashed with the sword qi, shattering it and standing before Wu Xingwen.

"Roar!" Chen Zhanbiao roared, transforming into a beast form. He stepped on the heavens and rushed toward Yin Wu.

"This Tianyuan Sect is all变态!" Yin Wu's heart was shocked. But his eyes were filled with battle spirit. He wrapped himself in a torrent of ghostly qi and collided head-on with Chen Zhanbiao.

Nan Gong Yuqing, Meng Xue, and others also found opponents. However, Xiang Tianming and Huo Zhu were more difficult because the Yama Ten Palace had nine Late-stage Immortal Kings, while they only had two.

"I'll take one of them for you. The rest are yours!" Lu Chong held a war hammer, waved his hand, and the hammer flew from his hands toward a Late-stage Immortal King.

" One against four!" Xiang Tianming and Huo Zhu exchanged glances. But at this moment, only they two could hold it.

"Even if we can't withstand it, we must!" They gritted their teeth and rushed toward the remaining eight Late-stage Immortal Kings.

The scene immediately became chaotic. Tianyuan Sect's disciples rushed downward from the mountain, eyes filled with madness. The Hell forces rushed upward. The battlefield collided instantly, martial arts and blood flying everywhere. Tianyuan Sect's disciples fought desperately.

But the Hell forces were elites among elites. In an instant, Tianyuan Sect was at a disadvantage. The battle had just begun, and the casualties weren't large yet. The hardest part was for Huo Zhu and Xiang Tianming, each facing four Late-stage Immortal Kings. They could only endure with great difficulty.

Huo Zhu controlled endless fire, forming attacks that continuously attacked the four Late-stage Immortal Kings.

Peng... Peng... The four Late-stage Immortal Kings showed contempt, each launching attacks. A series of fire dragons shattered before their bodies.

Xiang Tianming's situation was also desperate. He transformed into his true form, flapped his wings, and swept across the eight directions. His attacks were easily shattered by the four Late-stage Immortal Kings. This was land, not water; Xiang Tianming's strength had been significantly weakened.

In an instant, four attacks struck Xiang Tianming's massive body. His enormous form shattered the void.

Wum... A vortex appeared in the sky. Xiang Tianming opened his mouth and sucked in the wind, drawing a large number of clouds into his body. He suddenly exhaled.

Hualala... The waves surged, a river of water rising and rushing toward the four Late-stage Immortal Kings.

A large amount of blood was scattered. Xiang Tianming's body had four deep wounds, and the sky seemed to rain blood.

The sound of strong collisions and cries of battle echoed. Every moment, people died. Blood built up the Tianyuan Mountain.

On Tianyuan Mountain, there were cries. The elderly prayed desperately, their eyes filled with despair as they watched the Tianyuan Sect disciples fighting.

Death... Death... Each disciple of Tianyuan Sect fell into the blood pool, eyes filled with madness. They rushed forward without hesitation. Once the one in front died, the next would rush up.

"Kill!" The disciples of Tianyuan Sect roared. But as time passed, Tianyuan Sect gradually became overwhelmed. Their opponents had more numbers and strength; their strength was one level lower. A large number of corpses fell, and the Hell elites slowly advanced toward Tianyuan Mountain.

In terms of Immortal Kings, deaths also occurred. A disciple who had defected to Tianyuan Mountain was instantly turned into a mist of blood by Huang Tianxiang.

Jiang Sxi gazed at the disciple who had died, a deep sorrow in her heart. Tianyuan Sect was her life's work; she cared for every disciple more than anyone else.

Ten thousand... Twenty thousand...

Tianyuan Sect's people were losing at a terrifying speed, causing Jiang Sxi and Nan Gong Yuqing to burn with anger.

"Lu Tian, don't return. Take revenge for me!" A roar echoed through the heavens and earth. A massive sound of thunder rang out, causing the entire battlefield to pause.

"Senior Brother!" Nan Gong Yuqing's eyes turned blood-red. He gazed toward the direction of the disturbance, his heart feeling as if struck by something heavy. A mouthful of blood spewed from Nan Gong Yuqing's mouth.

Li Tianzhi, former second-in-command of the Star River Four Thieves. Later became the Lord of Thunder Domain. He had risen with Lu and Nan Gong Yuqing. Though he rarely spoke, their feelings were deep. Now he had disappeared.

"No choice!" A cold voice echoed. Wang Xiu's face showed sorrow, gazing at the Eight Treasures Wheel falling from the sky.

Chapter 2711: Captured

The bloodstained Eight Treasures Wheel fell to the ground, emitting a series of hums. It seemed like mourning.

Nan Gong Yuqing and others were heartbroken, but they knew now was the time to suppress their grief. Otherwise, it would affect their battle.

"Go! Don't worry about me. Go help them!" Wan Lingkong spoke as he slowly regained consciousness, seeing Li Tianzhi's death. He addressed Ren Hongzhe who was taking care of him.

"Good, be careful!" Ren Hongzhe's eyes were filled with tears. He stepped on the ground and rushed toward the battlefield, aiming to find the next target for Wang Xiu.

Grief turned into strength. Diao Dezhu and others became completely mad, fighting without restraint because they knew Tianyuan Sect's fate was grim.

"Roar..." All of Tianyuan Sect's people roared, their eyes bloodshot. But the Hell army surrounded Tianyuan Sect and continuously pushed toward the mountain.

"Lu Tian, don't return!" At this moment, Jiang Sxi and others prayed for Lu Tian not to return. Even if he did, it would be too late; there were too many Late-stage Immortal Kings.

"Zhao Tian Tower!" Jiang Sxi shouted. The Zhao Tian Tower rushed toward Li Yuqing, emitting a powerful pressure that made Li Yuqing's face change.

"Unexpectedly, Tianyuan Sect still has such a treasure!" Li Yuqing's eyes gleamed. He gazed at the Zhao Tian Tower descending from the sky.

The Zhao Tian Tower had no Heaven-Healing Stone, but its power was still astonishing. Even Li Yuqing needed to fully confront it.

Li Yuqing's hands moved swiftly, and a massive cauldron thundered down. A heavy aura radiated outward, colliding with the Zhao Tian Tower.

Boom...

The two treasures collided and then flew into the sky, disappearing into unknown places.

"What else do you have?" Li Yuqing smiled coldly, gazing at Jiang Sxi with greed. He had decided to conquer this woman from the moment he saw her, whether by body or spirit.

"Many methods!" Jiang Sxi's long hair flew. She danced with her sword, clashing again with Li Yuqing.

One million... Two million...

Time passed slowly. Half a day had gone by, and Tianyuan Sect had lost over two million people. The Hell army also suffered losses but had reached the entrance of Tianyuan Sect.

"Stand firm! Don't let them enter the sect!" The disciples of Tianyuan Sect fought desperately, pushing back the Hell army at the gate.

"Ha! That's all you have?" The Hell soldiers laughed contemptuously, charging more fiercely. They knew that if they broke through here, they would have won.

In the sky, the battle of Immortal Kings was also extremely brutal. Everyone bore injuries. Chen Zhanbiao's body was covered in blood, constantly fighting against Yin Wu.

"Can't withstand it anymore!" Others also struggled desperately. Some fought two against one, and there were casualties.

"What if Tianyuan Sect is really destroyed?" The elderly and weak who couldn't fight cried out.

At the moment Tianyuan Sect's people felt desperate, a black cloud descended from the sky. Blood splattered everywhere.

Peng...

In an instant, a massive body crashed into the attacking Hell army. It was Xiang Tianming's true form.

At this moment, Xiang Tianming was extremely pitiful. His two wings seemed to have been forcibly broken, blood gushing like a fountain from his massive body. His body was also covered with wounds.

As Xiang Tianming fell, a large number of Hell soldiers died under the impact. The area around him turned blood-red.

Peng... Peng...

His massive tail continuously struck the ground, trying to take off again. But it seemed he had used up all his strength and couldn't move.

"Late-stage Immortal King!" The Hell soldiers shouted, their faces showing joy. They looked at the struggling Xiang Tianming and immediately launched martial arts toward him.

A torrent of martial arts exploded on Xiang Tianming's body, causing a large number of blood mist. Xiang Tianming's tail no longer moved. His body shrank and transformed into human form, but his eyes were closed, and his breath was gradually weakening.

"Capture him!" From the sky, four Late-stage Immortal Kings looked at Xiang Tianming and ordered people.

Late-stage Immortal Kings were rare. Xiang Tianming, a beast-type Late-stage Immortal King, was even more precious. For the Yama Ten Palace, they had methods to make him submit.

"Next, finish it. I didn't expect even the attacking army from the Immortal Realm to arrive before this!" The four Late-stage Immortal Kings gazed at another battlefield.

Huo Zhu was still desperately resisting. Lu Chong's side, with the help of a chaotic wind, fought against one Late-stage Immortal King. Both would eventually lose.

One Late-stage Immortal King sneered and took a step forward, his long sword slashing toward Chen Zhanbiao who was constantly fighting against Yin Wu.

"Ah..." Chen Zhanbiao roared. His strong body pushed Yin Wu away and grabbed a fist toward the sword qi.

Blood mist rose. Chen Zhanbiao's fist was instantly split by the sword qi, and his massive body returned to normal size.

"Terrifying!" Yin Wu panted. He thought his body was strong enough, no one could suppress him except Luo Tian. But in their previous clash, this big man had suppressed him and he couldn't fight back. If others fought against Chen Zhanbiao, they would definitely be unable to withstand.

At the same time, three other Late-stage Immortal Kings also attacked. One flew toward Huo Zhu's battlefield, while the other two fell into the front-line battle between Tianyuan Sect and the Hell forces.

Two Late-stage Immortal Kings joining was like a giant falling into a group of ants.

Peng... Peng... Peng...

Blood mist rose. In an instant, the domain surrounded two Late-stage Immortal Kings within ten thousand feet, instantly turning into a blood world.

In an instant, Tianyuan Sect's mountain gate was smashed open by the two Late-stage Immortal Kings. The two powerful warriors smiled and stepped into Tianyuan Sect.

"The Grand Master commands: no one left alive!" The two Late-stage Immortal Kings shouted. A large number of Tianyuan Sect disciples died under the two Late-stage Immortal Kings' hands. The entrance to Tianyuan Sect was completely torn open by the two.

"Kill!" These Hell elites, trained to only obey orders, rushed into Tianyuan Sect like tigers and wolves. They killed anyone they met.

"Stop them!" The disciples of Tianyuan Sect cried out, but it was no use. They rushed forward one after another, like cutting wheat, being killed by the two Late-stage Immortal Kings.

"Done..." Jiang Sxi and others watched the Hell army that had entered Tianyuan Sect. They knew this time was grim.

"You dare to die!" As the two Late-stage Immortal Kings continuously killed Tianyuan Sect's people, a wave of energy rose in front of one Late-stage Immortal King.

Chapter 2712: They Have All Returned

Cold killing intent locked onto the old man, instantly freezing his body. His face showed seriousness.

"Who!" The old man shouted. His aura swept across the eight directions, sensing any movement within his domain.

"Killing intent! A powerful killing intent. An absolute killer!" The old man's heart was shocked. He cautiously looked around, sensing a life-threatening danger.

As the old man was startled, a flash of cold light appeared in front of him. A ghostly figure also appeared, eyes filled with killing intent.

"Die!" The old man shouted. He grabbed the cold light at his throat, and with his other hand, he slammed toward the ghostly figure.

A dagger was caught by the old man. The sharp dagger almost pierced his throat, blood dripping from his hand onto the ground.

But the old man's palm precisely hit the dagger's owner. A dull sound echoed, and the figure spat blood before flying back, crashing into the old man's domain.

"An early-stage Immortal King dares to assassinate me..."

Ugh... The old man's face showed mockery. He looked at the figure who had crashed into his domain, falling from it. But before he could finish speaking, his body suddenly trembled. A flash of cold light pierced through his throat.

"Killing you is no problem!" A cold voice echoed behind the old man. A figure held a dagger and pierced it into his neck.

The old man's face showed disbelief. Blood flowed from his mouth, and he tried to turn around but slowly fell to the ground. His life force faded, as if absorbed by the dagger.

This all happened in an instant. Even another Late-stage Immortal King hadn't reacted. When he did, the old man had already fallen.

"Dead..." The other Late-stage Immortal King's face turned pale. He pointed a finger, sending a divine light toward the figure who had killed the old man.

Blood mist flashed. The figure's shoulder was pierced, and his body flew back. His eyes still showed a smile.

"Xiu, Tian Luo!" Diao Dezhu and others finally recognized the two. They gasped.

The two had always traveled together in the Immortal Realm. Upon hearing news of Tianyuan Sect being besieged by Hell, they had rushed back desperately.

"Didn't come too late, did we?" Xiu and Tian Luo smiled with regret. They had suffered heavy injuries but stood up, gazing at Diao Dezhu and others.

"Killed a Late-stage Immortal King!" The Hell army was shocked. They watched Xiu and Tian Luo, feeling that despite their cultivation being only Mid-stage Immortal King, they had slain a Late-stage Immortal King.

"What kind of trouble can you two stir up now?" The remaining Late-stage Immortal King's face showed contempt. Xiu and Tian Luo were indeed powerful, but they had paid a price for killing that old man. They had suffered heavy injuries.
