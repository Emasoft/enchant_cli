"Little Jie, aren't you a good younger brother? My elder brother has been exhausted lately. You shouldn't help me shoulder some of the burden?" Luotian, with his smooth and persuasive manner, continued to persuade Long Jie.

"Trickery... keep tricking..." Naturally, Long Jie understood Luotian's intentions. He knew Luotian was merely trying to deceive him.

Yet, Long Jie trusted Luotian and felt compassion for him. Ultimately, he was successfully swayed by Luotian's words.

"Fine!" Long Jie, dazed and confused, was escorted out by Luotian. He returned to his residence in a hazy state.

"This time is settled! The new master of Tianyuan Sect will be Long Jie!" Luotian, fearing that Long Jie might change his mind, decided the matter immediately.

"Little Jie is indeed easy to deal with. He truly grew up under my guidance!" Luotian sat on a chair, feeling relieved and sighed deeply.

"Let me pass the position to Wan Lingkong..." However, as soon as Luotian sat down, Long Jie's voice echoed across Tianyuan Mountain. It nearly made Luotian fall to the ground in shock.

"Damn it..." Luotian muttered involuntarily. His intention was for Long Jie to hold the position briefly before passing it on, but he had misunderstood.

"Damn it..." Not only Luotian, but the entire Tianyuan Mountain resounded with this exclamation. Everyone was bewildered and felt they couldn't keep up with the pace of these masters.

"Is being master so painful?" The people of Tianyuan Sect were stunned, unable to comprehend why the position that others fought over so fiercely was now being passed around like a hot potato.

"Did you think they would pass it on?" Wan Lingkong, seated in his place, sneered and directly transferred the position to Li Tianzhi.

In an instant, the sound of passing positions echoed throughout Tianyuan Mountain. Within less than an hour, the master's position had changed hands seven or eight times.

"Who will be next?" The people of Tianyuan Sect felt numb, listening to the sound of passing positions and twitching their lips.

"Who cares anyway..." People were speechless, going about their own business without taking it seriously.

"Haha, finally my turn!" Diao Dezhu stood in his courtyard, adjusting his robes. After passing it around, only he remained without receiving the position.

Diao Dezhu had been waiting for someone to pass it to him. Unlike others, he wanted to be the master solely to show off.

The thought of standing before thousands of people, revered and admired, made Diao Dezhu slightly excited. He already envisioned how he would show off once he became the master.

But waiting and waiting, Diao Dezhu never heard anyone pass it to him. This made him impatient.

"Damn it, this passing around is so boring. Come on, let's discuss!" Luotian finally couldn't sit still.

In Luotian's courtyard, Nan Gong Yuqing and others sat there. They looked at each other before turning their gazes to Luotian.

"Luotian, you were once the master of nine regions and a legend of Tianyuan Sect. Who else is suitable to be the master?"

"Rubbish, Nan Gong, your righteousness is as high as a mountain. You are the one who should naturally take this position!" The others then fiercely argued.

"Damn it, why hasn't anyone passed it to me!" Amid the arguments, a furious voice rang out. Diao Dezhu in his purple robe appeared at Luotian's courtyard entrance.

"You guys don't want to take it, I will!" Diao Dezhu strode into the courtyard and looked at Luotian.

"Get out..." Luotian and others, upon seeing Diao Dezhu entering, were momentarily stunned. They muttered a curse but continued arguing as if they hadn't seen him, leaving Diao Dezhu embarrassed.

They knew who Diao Dezhu was. If he truly became the master, Tianyuan Sect would be in chaos.

"Y’all little bastards, what are you arguing about!" As the others argued, Xiang Tianming frowned and entered. His face was grim; he had never seen such peculiar people before.

"Respected elder, please speak up. Who is suitable to be the master?" Luotian kept making eye signals at Xiang Tianming. These people could only be controlled by him, as his seniority was undeniable.

"Draw lots!" Xiang Tianming simply said two words, causing Luotian's group to show a hint of joy.

"Right! This is such a fair solution, why didn't we think of it!" The others clapped their hands and marveled.

"Come on, draw the lot. Whoever draws a slip with 'master' will be the master!" Xiang Tianming's voice rang out again. He produced a jade bucket with slips inside, their strong energy masked by the bamboo slips.

"I'll go first!" Wan Lingkong stepped forward, knowing that drawing earlier meant a lower chance of getting it. Others quickly caught on and took the slips in an instant, leaving only one slip behind.

"It's not me... it's not me..." Everyone looked at their slips, faces lit up with joy.

"One left. Who didn't take it?" People then turned their gaze to the last slip, looking at each other.

"Diao Dezhu!" Their bodies jolted as they saw Diao Dezhu in the corner, drawing circles.

"Can't be..." Luotian and others were speechless. The thought of Diao Dezhu's smugness as master made them feel Tianyuan Sect's future was dark.

"Diao Dezhu, come draw the slip!" Xiang Tianming also looked at Diao Dezhu oddly and called out to him.

"Haha, I really am destined to be the master!" Diao Dezhu laughed and walked over to Xiang Tianming, grabbing the slip from the jade bucket. He held it high above his head as if he were a sovereign, with the character 'master' appearing on the slip.

Chapter 2397: Struggle for the Sect ()

Diao Dezhu stood proudly, his eyes filled with arrogance as he gazed at Luotian and others.

"I've never been a master before. Actually, I don't care much for the title of master. My happiest memory is when I was free and unrestrained in the Demon Region!"

"However, since you all have such high regard for me, I'll reluctantly accept this position!" Diao Dezhu then straightened his face and addressed Luotian. This made Luotian and others uncomfortable, as they wished to stomp Diao Dezhu's face.

"You guys are such rotten hands!" Luotian muttered involuntarily, looking at Diao Dezhu who was already backtracking to show off.

"Your luck isn't great either!" Wan Lingkong and others muttered, looking at Diao Dezhu. Nan Gong Yuqing and others were speechless; they all knew Diao Dezhu's character. Though unwilling, there was nothing they could do.

"Little Luotian, come and pay your respects to the master. You may leave now!" Diao Dezhu, with his hands behind his back, looked at Luotian and others.

"From now on, I am the master of Tianyuan Sect—Diao Dezhu!" Diao Dezhu's authoritative voice echoed across Tianyuan Sect, causing a slight tremor among the people. However, it didn't stir any excitement.

"It might change again soon!" The people of Tianyuan Sect showed no reaction, continuing with their own tasks.

"Damn it..." Diao Dezhu muttered, realizing what was happening. He saw Luotian and others secretly laughing at him.

"Boom..." A massive aura erupted from Diao Dezhu, and he soared into the air. A purple shadow instantly appeared above Tianyuan Sect.

"I'll say it again: after the decision of several elders and senior elders, I am now the master of Tianyuan Sect!" The purple shadow carried an unusual aura, causing a brief pause among the people of Tianyuan Sect.

"Oh... I see..."

"Respect the master..." A series of lifeless voices rang out, making Diao Dezhu almost lose his temper.

"Boom..." Just as Diao Dezhu's words finished, Luotian's body radiated powerful energy. His face slightly changed as he waved his hand.

Three tokens appeared in people's sight, their energy sources coming from these three tokens. These were the "Struggle for Heaven" tokens obtained after destroying three sects.

Light surged, and a powerful aura directly dispersed the illusion formed by Diao Dezhu. Three golden characters appeared above Tianyuan Sect, in the Dragon Silk Valley.

"What is this?" Seeing these three characters, the entire Tianyuan Sect, including Luotian and others, were all stunned.

"They are sects that will struggle for heaven!" Luotian's breath tightened as he looked at the three characters, his eyes filled with disbelief. At the same time, in the middle of the Three Heavens, the Dragon Silk Valley also rose a series of divine laws, as if issuing an imperial decree. These echoed in the ears of the people of Dragon Silk Valley.

"Ten years from now, the sects in the lower three heavens will struggle for heaven. You must resist the attacks from the lower three heavens!" A cold, emotionless voice rose in the Dragon Silk Valley, causing its people to be momentarily stunned.

"Did I hear that right?" The people of Dragon Silk Valley showed disbelief, doubting their ears.

"Are we being asked to stop the lower three heavens' sects from struggling for heaven?"

"This is like sending tigers to intercept rabbits!" The disciples of Xuanwu Valley immediately murmured. Dragon Silk Valley was the second strongest sect in the middle three heavens. Although Star River Palace had recently enhanced its strength, it could still match them. But Dragon Silk Valley's power was undeniable.

"According to tradition, shouldn't it be the weakest sect that struggles? Why is it Dragon Silk Valley now?"

"This is clearly not giving Tianyuan Sect any chance to survive!" The disciples of Dragon Silk Valley discussed.

"I heard that Tianyuan Sect was founded by Luotian, so it's a revenge for what happened in the Xuan Yue Realm!" Qin Tianming coldly spoke. Back then, Luotian had captured people from the Xuan Yue Realm, including him. Although he was restored by the Immortal King of Eternal Life, he still held a grudge against Luotian.

"Luotian?" Qin He Feng stood in his residence, muttering lowly, his eyes revealing a hint of battle spirit.

...

"This isn't playing with us!" On the other side, people from Tianyuan Sect cursed. Luotian and others had dark expressions.

"Dragon Silk Valley, how can we fight against them with our current strength?" Luotian's face showed a bitter smile as he looked at Diao Dezhu.

"Uh..." Diao Dezhu was stunned, not expecting Luotian to suddenly ask him. His aura immediately weakened. Their Tianyuan Sect was strong, but in terms of overall strength, it was not even close to Dragon Silk Valley. They couldn't fight.

"Ten years... we can't catch up even if we try!" Diao Dezhu descended from the sky, speaking softly.

"How could this be? This is completely different from when Shenglong Sect struggled for heaven! It's like comparing ten thousand miles!" Luotian muttered in his heart, unable to figure it out. He had thought that Tianyuan Sect's struggle for heaven would be a formality, extremely simple.

"Who said we can't fight?" Just as everyone was at a loss, a bold voice rang out. Two figures appeared in the sky of Tianyuan Sect, their aura overwhelming.

One old man looked like a ball of fire, and beside him stood an exquisite woman with a smile on her face.

"Fire Master, Qian Xue!" Luotian saw the two and immediately showed a joyful expression. He clapped his hands and flew up.

"This is the Fire Master!" Diao Dezhu and others showed excitement, looking at the two descending from the sky. The Fire Master, Meng Wushuang, had an aura of a mid-level Immortal King. Even Xiang Tianming looked solemn.

Previously, the Fire Master Meng Wushuang had followed the Medicine King Sect's people and parted ways with Luotian and others. They hadn't communicated much with Meng Wushuang.

The Master of the Era, a legendary figure in the Nine Regions, was rarely seen by them. Seeing the Fire Master for the first time in the Immortal Realm made them excited.

Everyone looked at Meng Wushuang with admiration. The Fire Master was the first time they had seen a Master of the Era in the Immortal Realm.

"However, even with me, we can only match Dragon Silk Valley's Immortal King strength. The three of us are enough to suppress the Immortal Kings of Dragon Silk Valley!" The Fire Master spoke confidently.

Their three strengths were very strong, and against opponents of the same level, they naturally felt confident. The Fire Master's appearance also greatly boosted Luotian and others' confidence.

"He is an Immortal King, another one! And looking at Luotian's attitude, he clearly surpasses Luotian!" The people of Tianyuan Sect were also invigorated, recovering from the shock of fighting against Dragon Silk Valley.

"But Tianyuan Sect's overall strength is much weaker than Dragon Silk Valley. Even though you three are semi-Immortal Kings, they can't match Dragon Silk Valley's Immortal Kings!"

"Moreover, I feel this struggle for heaven is quite mysterious. Previously, the weakest sect in the middle three heavens would be chosen, but this time it's Dragon Silk Valley!"

"Struggle for heaven is not something anyone can control. It's the will of Heaven that chooses it. Perhaps a high-level Immortal King influenced the will of Heaven!" Meng Wushuang spoke, causing Luotian's face to darken.

Luotian immediately thought of the Eternal Life Immortal King. He couldn't think of anyone else. The other high-level Immortal Kings had already been pacified, and they definitely wouldn't get involved in small tricks.

Moreover, Luotian had thought about the Eternal Life Immortal King's gaze at him, filled with greed. Although he didn't know what the Eternal Life Immortal King was greedy for on his body.

Dragon Silk Valley was a faction under the Eternal Life Mountains. Luotian had almost concluded that only the Eternal Life Immortal King had the motive and means for this.

"What is he after? Does he know I am a descendant of the Heaven-Ordained Sect?" Luotian felt confused and puzzled.

"We need to find a way to enhance Tianyuan Sect's overall strength. Ten years, there is still much room for improvement!" The Fire Master Meng Wushuang spoke, his voice carrying a heavy tone.

Meng Wushuang had been in the Immortal Realm for many years, so he was well-versed and knew how to quickly enhance Tianyuan Sect's strength.

"Zhao Tian Pagoda!" Meng Wushuang then spoke, making Luotian's eyes widen. The incredible resources in Zhao Tian Pagoda could definitely allow for a rapid enhancement of strength.

But the mention of Zhao Tian Pagoda made Luotian feel touched.

"Back then, we left too quickly and didn't observe carefully. Now that I think about it, there are some doubts!"

"The artifact spirit subdued the demon body's strength by eight-tenths, leaving two-tenths. Perhaps we could fight it!" The Fire Master spoke softly, causing Luotian's body to tremble slightly.

"Indeed. Then why did the artifact spirit send us out? We both were severely injured at that time!"

"Supreme Heaven Stone!" Luotian muttered to himself, recalling the Supreme Heaven Stone still being there. He then thought of a possibility, and his eyes gradually turned dark.

"That bastard!" Luotian suddenly understood, feeling he might have been tricked by the Supreme Heaven Stone.

At that time, the artifact spirit burned itself to subdue the demon body. Finally, the Supreme Heaven Stone took over. It was likely that the entire Zhao Tian Pagoda had been controlled by the Supreme Heaven Stone, and the Supreme Heaven Stone's only purpose was that.

"The entire Zhao Tian Pagoda!" Luotian couldn't help but speak out, the resources in Zhao Tian Pagoda were definitely terrifying. The Supreme Heaven Stone was always greedy and insatiable, so when it encountered Zhao Tian Pagoda, it would be like a wolf seeing a beauty.

"Son of a bitch, he wants to eat it all alone!" Luotian gritted his teeth, making people stunned. It was the first time they had seen Luotian with such a depressed expression.

"So I want to go with you again and explore Zhao Tian Pagoda. If we get Zhao Tian Pagoda, it will definitely enhance Tianyuan Sect's strength quickly, and it is also a good treasure." Meng Wushuang spoke, bringing Luotian back to his senses.

"Respected elder, we should go now!" Luotian spoke to the Fire Master, his eyes filled with urgency. He was worried about arriving too late and leaving nothing for himself.

Chapter 2398: Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone ()

"Why so urgent!" The Fire Master was puzzled, as were the others.

"Go any later, and you won't even get a drop of soup!" Luotian didn't have time to explain, transforming into a long rainbow and flying toward the Huantian Island.

"Uh..." The Fire Master was stunned, then flew up and followed Luotian's direction.

"I'll fly you!" The Fire Master spoke to Luotian, as he was still at the middle-level Immortal King. Luotian had been suppressed to a semi-Immortal King, so the Fire Master's speed was fast. The two transformed into a long rainbow and disappeared from people's sight.

"Truly..."

"Did Luotian get tricked? The last time I saw this expression was when he was tricked by Sun Kelian!" Nan Gong Yuqing and others looked at Luotian's anxious expression, their eyes showing a hint of amusement.

"Alright, we should prepare as well. We can't do nothing!" Diao Dezhu spoke, his eyes showing a hint of seriousness.

At once, the entire Tianyuan Sect became tense. Everyone started to cultivate and explore the dangerous places in the lower three heavens. Even Nan Gong Yuqing led teams personally to enhance the sect's strength. Meanwhile, the matter of struggling for heaven spread across the middle and lower three heavens, causing people to discuss it.

"How is this possible? It's Dragon Silk Valley! The second strongest sect in the middle three heavens. It has an Immortal King at the middle level, and there's no comparison!"

"They say that Tianyuan Sect's master isn't Luotian, but a guy named Diao Dezhu!"

"Maybe he ran away because he couldn't succeed in struggling for heaven. After all, he has a high position in the Supreme Heaven Mountains of the upper three heavens. He didn't need to get involved in this mess!" People from the middle three heavens discussed.

Meanwhile, people from the lower three heavens also talked about this matter. They hadn't expected that even a strong sect like Tianyuan Sect couldn't succeed in struggling for heaven.

"What kind of hostility does this have toward the lower three heavens!" The people from the lower three heavens shouted in anger.

Everyone unanimously believed that Tianyuan Sect couldn't succeed in struggling for heaven. After all, it was a giant, and Tianyuan Sect had just been established with shallow roots.

While the people of the middle three heavens and lower three heavens were discussing this struggle for heaven, Tianyuan Sect's people were working hard, as if they hadn't heard the rumors outside.

Luotian and the Fire Master arrived at the edge of the Death Desert, gazing at the golden desert with a sense of admiration.

"Where does this desert end?" Luotian whispered, feeling that the Death Desert had no end.

"Xumishan!" The Fire Master spoke, causing Luotian's heart to pause. He hadn't expected the Fire Master to know this.

"Yes, it is one of the nine Immortal Mountains—Xumishan. That's why we found Zhao Tian Pagoda and saw those monks!"

"However, even I have never seen the real Xumishan. Legends say only those who are devoted to Buddhism can see the life-giving Xumishan in this Death Desert!" The Fire Master spoke softly, telling Luotian many legends about Xumishan.

After arriving in the middle three heavens, Luotian's strength had recovered to the early Immortal King level. The two moved quickly and rushed into the Death Desert toward the location where Zhao Tian Pagoda had been.

Winds swept, sand filled the sky, and Luotian and the Fire Master were no longer as helpless as they had been when returning from the Death Desert. They pushed through dangers and crushed them directly.

After two days of flying, Luotian and the Fire Master finally reached the place where Zhao Tian Pagoda had appeared. However, they didn't find Zhao Tian Pagoda there, causing Luotian's face to darken.

"Did that guy run away?" Luotian muttered in his heart, closing his eyes to sense the direction of the Supreme Heaven Stone. After all, he was the master of the Supreme Heaven Stone. Although it often tricked him, if it wasn't far away, Luotian could still sense its location.

"What's going on?" The Fire Master was puzzled, seeing Luotian closing his eyes. A faint fluctuation appeared in Luotian's perception, causing him to feel happy. Being able to sense the Supreme Heaven Stone's position was the best news.

"Son of a bitch, I'll catch you and kill you!" Luotian muttered, speaking to the Fire Master: "Respected elder, please follow me!"

The two flew up again and rushed toward the direction Luotian sensed. Luotian was anxious, as he could only sense a rough position. Moreover, he felt that the Supreme Heaven Stone's fluctuation was moving away from him, almost escaping his perception.

With their speed increasing, the fluctuation of the Supreme Heaven Stone became stronger, causing Luotian's face to show a hint of joy.

The fluctuation of the Supreme Heaven Stone wasn't moving quickly. Eventually, it stopped. However, Luotian and the Fire Master had chased it for nearly three days before finally sensing the exact position of the Supreme Heaven Stone.

A forest composed of wind-eroded mountains appeared before Luotian and the Fire Master, causing them to stop.

"What place is this?" Luotian's eyes showed surprise. He had entered the Death Desert more than once, but this was the first time he saw something other than sand in it.

The continuous mountain bodies formed a stone forest. Although the mountains looked fragile, like they had been eroded by wind, in such a harsh environment as the Death Desert, their existence was no coincidence. It was clear that this forest wasn't simple.

"Master!" Just as Luotian and the Fire Master were confused, the voice of the Supreme Heaven Stone echoed in Luotian's mind, causing him to be startled.

"Master! Come save me quickly! I was captured by a bald monk and taken away. Right now, I'm using a secret method to talk to you. I can't hear your response!" Before Luotian could respond, the Supreme Heaven Stone's voice rang out again.

"Go..." Luotian flew up and rushed into the stone forest, but he wasn't too anxious. He knew the Supreme Heaven Stone wouldn't die.

As they moved through the stone forest, Luotian felt a mysterious power surrounding them, as if it could isolate spiritual awareness.

"This stone forest isn't simple!" The Fire Master spoke, warning Luotian to be careful. This made Luotian cautious.

Time passed, and Luotian and the Fire Master finally caught up with the fluctuation of the Supreme Heaven Stone. Through several mountain bodies, Luotian could even see waves of red light.

"Boom..." At the same time, a series of collision sounds echoed in the distance, shaking the earth. A violent dust storm and invisible power surged toward Luotian and the Fire Master's bodies.

Luotian and the Fire Master narrowed their eyes, and the Fire Master's red domain spread out, covering thousands of feet.

"Someone is fighting!" The Fire Master's eyes flickered, and he flew toward the direction of the fight with Luotian.

After a moment, Luotian and the Fire Master saw the fighting scene, their eyes showing surprise.

In front of them was an old monk with a fierce aura, holding a golden small pagoda and continuously smashing it forward. Opposing the old monk was a black dragon, about a hundred feet long. The dragon's scales radiated powerful energy and had a cold glow in its eyes, making people feel an icy chill.

"幻魔石!" Luotian exclaimed and immediately recognized the dragon's eyes as being made of "Huan Mo Shi" (Illusion Demon Stone).

The old monk continuously threw the small pagoda, smashing it onto the dragon's massive body and causing large scales to fall to the ground. More surprisingly, the debris falling from the dragon's body had its demonic energy dispersed and transformed into a crystalline jade-like object, radiating divine light.

"八宝琉仙石!" The Fire Master exclaimed and looked at the fragments with disbelief. "Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone," a cultivation treasure, where sitting on it would double the results of cultivation. It contained an abundant amount of immortal energy and was rarer than immortal crystals!

Luotian's mind immediately recalled the information about "Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone," and his breath became hurried. He looked at the hundred-foot-long black dragon, clearly realizing that its entire body was made of "Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone."

"Immortal King Mid-level!" After that, Luotian turned his gaze to the old monk and slightly narrowed his eyes.

"Painful... bald monk, my master has arrived! See how I'll kill you!" The golden small pagoda continuously collided with the dragon, and a series of angry shouts echoed out. This made the old monk's face slightly change as he saw Luotian and the Fire Master appearing.

"Stupid teammates!" Luotian muttered in his heart, thinking that the Supreme Heaven Stone called him master, clearly reminding the old monk that he had come to retrieve Zhao Tian Pagoda.

"Buddha's compassion!" The old monk, of medium build with white eyebrows and wearing a red robe, had twelve marks on his forehead indicating his status in the Buddhist sect. Twelve marks meant he was a Buddha-level master.

"Master, please help me subdue the demon!" The old monk held Zhao Tian Pagoda and spoke to Luotian.

"Master... I won't give up, wait for your return! Please save me!" The Supreme Heaven Stone cried out loudly. The golden small pagoda shook violently in the old monk's hands.

"Monks don't lie, little pagoda! You weren't saying this before!" The old monk's eyes showed a smile. He held the pagoda with one hand and continuously struck it against the dragon with the other.

"Respected elder, we can help you subdue the demon, but could you please return our things to us?" Luotian spoke loudly. The old monk's actions clearly indicated he didn't want to return Zhao Tian Pagoda to him.

"It seems there are good and bad people everywhere!" Luotian muttered in his heart, thinking of Zhihong and Jiedu. Only Jiedu was truly a Buddhist practitioner.

Chapter 2399: The Half of the Mind Demon Ceremony ()

Hearing Luotian's words, the old monk's eyebrows slightly furrowed. Xumishan was mysterious and respected in the Immortal Realm. Even other immortal mountains didn't dare to provoke it. The old monk hadn't expected Luotian to directly demand his things.

"This Zhao Tian Pagoda is my Xumishan's property, and it should be under our control!"

"Moreover, this pagoda has a connection with me. I can't give it to you!" The old monk spoke, his voice still warm and carrying an unusual aura. This made Luotian and the Fire Master unintentionally lose their hostility toward him.

Luotian regained his composure, looking at the old monk with caution. However, Luotian was no ordinary person; his willpower was firm and not easily deceived.

"Where is it written? Ask him who he calls master!" Luotian sneered and urged the Supreme Heaven Stone to move toward him.

"Boom..." Under Luotian's urging, the relic stone that had been missing from Zhao Tian Pagoda was now a red stone—exactly the Supreme Heaven Stone.

The Supreme Heaven Stone shook violently, causing Zhao Tian Pagoda to tremble in the old monk's hands.

"Damn it!" The old monk's face slightly changed. This dragon wasn't easy to deal with, and now Zhao Tian Pagoda was rebelling against him, leaving him in a passive position.

"Ha! Bald monk, my master has arrived! You still want me to submit? Dream on!" The Supreme Heaven Stone shouted arrogantly, emitting a massive aura. It broke free from the old monk's hands and soared above Luotian's head.

"Master, you've finally come! I missed you so much!" The Supreme Heaven Stone's excited voice rang out, and it transformed into a small pagoda that landed in Luotian's hands.

"You bastard, I'll deal with you later!" Luotian grabbed Zhao Tian Pagoda and felt its strength. His heart slightly lightened, but then his face darkened because he sensed that all the resources in Zhao Tian Pagoda's first twenty levels had disappeared...

"You said you'd make me wait a hundred years, but why did it happen so quickly?" Luotian sneered and looked at the old monk fighting the dragon.

"Boom..." At the same time, Luotian waved his hand, and Zhao Tian Pagoda emitted a series of divine lights. A figure appeared from Zhao Tian Pagoda.

Golden fur, an aura that surged into the sky, golden eyes with a hint of confusion. Upon seeing Luotian, they became clear.

"Luotian!" The golden monkey spoke, its golden eyes filled with excitement.

"Douzhan Sheng Yuan!" The old monk exclaimed, looking at Luotian's side with disbelief.

"You know me?" The golden monkey frowned and looked at the old monk. Previously, the old monk had only subdued the Supreme Heaven Stone but hadn't seen the golden monkey.

"I have a Buddha in Xumishan named Douzhan Sheng Fo, who must be related to you!" The old monk spoke while fighting the dragon.

"Douzhan Sheng Fo?" Upon hearing this, the golden monkey's eyes widened, and two golden divine lights shot out toward the old monk.

"Yao Huang Tian," the golden monkey's father, Luotian knew of only two Douzhan Sheng Yuans. This meant that the Buddha in Xumishan, Douzhan Sheng Fo, was likely the golden monkey's father, Yao Huang Tian.

"We are on the same side. Come with me to Xumishan and take refuge in my Buddha's teachings! There are your predecessors there!" The old monk spoke loudly.

"Looks like you're not a good one!" The golden monkey frowned and coldly said.

"Bald monk, give me this dragon! I'll help you subdue it. You can return to Xumishan and chant your sutras!" Luotian spoke, as he also valued the "Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone," especially with a piece of "Huan Mo Shi" on it.

"Get out... young people shouldn't be greedy! This Zhao Tian Pagoda isn't something you can touch!" The old monk coldly spoke.

"This is a treasure of the world, and you just said that those with a connection can have it!" Luotian smiled and waved his hand, revealing the necklace with "Huan Mo Shi" around his neck.

The black Huan Mo Shi emitted a faint divine light, although it was suppressed, it still had demonic energy flowing.

"Roar..." Upon the appearance of this necklace, the dragon let out a roar and didn't attack the old monk but rushed toward Luotian.

"Respected elder, block this monk!" Luotian laughed and flew up. He activated the Huangquan Step (Yellow Spring Step), re-entered the Zhao Tian Pagoda with the golden monkey, and flew away.

"You..." The old monk's face changed. He had gained a lot from this trip, not only obtaining Zhao Tian Pagoda but also discovering this dragon made of "Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone." The "Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone" was used to carve many Buddha thrones in Xumishan. Sitting on it for years, they meditated.

At this moment, not only had Zhao Tian Pagoda disappeared but also the "Eight Treasures Glazed Immortal Stone" followed Luotian. Two treasures, each of which was rare in the world. Now they were both gone. Even if the old monk had a good temper, he was furious.

"Kid, even if you run to the ends of the earth, I'll catch you!" The old monk roared and flashed divine light under his feet, chasing Luotian.

"Are you too disrespectful to me?" However, as soon as the old monk moved, the Fire Master laughed and extended a red hand toward the old monk's path.

Feeling the powerful aura, the old monk's face slightly changed and didn't dare to be careless. He struck his palm against the red hand, colliding with it.

"Boom..."

Both were Immortal King Mid-level and collided fiercely, causing a storm of wind and breaking many wind-eroded mountains.

"Get out..." The old monk's hands formed a gesture, and his body was surrounded by Buddha light. A white halo appeared above him, emitting a humming sound that pressed down on Meng Wushuang.

Meng Wushuang had always smiled, and he didn't say he would kill the old monk but was confident in blocking him.

The sound of collision continued, and two Immortal King Mid-level masters clashed within the stone forest. Meanwhile, Luotian rushed out of the stone forest with the black dragon.

The dragon's aura was massive, and Luotian could feel its strength. After all, it had fought with the old monk, an Immortal King Mid-level master.

"First, we need to escape this stone forest! I feel it's not favorable for me here!" Luotian muttered in his heart. He was about to escape the stone forest when, suddenly, the dragon roared and the entire stone forest began to tremble. An invisible fluctuation spread from the ground upward.

"Crash..." A series of wind-eroded mountains shook and moved positions, and Luotian's view turned into an endless stone forest.

"Is this a illusion?" Luotian's eyes slightly narrowed, then showed a hint of joy. He turned around and punched.

"If I can't escape, then let's fight!" Luotian muttered in his heart and launched a powerful punch at the dragon's head.

"Crack..." A crisp sound rang out, and Luotian could clearly feel the sound of his bones cracking. At the same time, a massive impact force acted on Luotian's body, sending him flying back.

"Boom..."

A series of wind-eroded stone mountains collapsed before Luotian, and dust filled the air. Blood spilled from Luotian's mouth as he stood up again.

"Boom..." Just as he disappeared, a black dragon tail swept down and struck the spot where Luotian had been. A deep ditch appeared, and Luotian's body reappeared in the sky.
