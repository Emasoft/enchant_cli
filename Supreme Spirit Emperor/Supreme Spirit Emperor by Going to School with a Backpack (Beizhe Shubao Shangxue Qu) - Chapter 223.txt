“Abominations! All of you are abominations! Each one is more twisted than the last!” Diao Dezhu and Xu Liziye cursed, their gazes darting between Luo Tian and Sun Mengru.

There was no doubt—Sun Mengru’s power was overwhelming, even making Luo Tian question if he could match her. In a moment, two disciples of the Demon Domain at the early Sage stage were reduced to blood mist.

Sun Mengru’s hands moved slightly, and radiant beams of divine light shot forth—her clan’s unique Sacred Light Purification Technique. It cleansed the two Sage-level warriors without a trace.

“Terrible… if you marry him, Luo Tian, you’ll have your hands full!” Diao Dezhu murmured, watching the two Demon Domain warriors vanish. His heart trembled.

Though Diao Dezhu’s voice was low, Sun Mengru’s spiritual senses were razor-sharp. She overheard and furrowed her brows, casting a glance at Diao Dezhu. The latter shrank back, feeling a chill creep up his neck and clamped his mouth shut.

Three elders at the early Sage stage also heard, their brows furrowing as they glanced at Luo Tian before adopting expressions of reverence toward Sun Mengru, who had now descended to their level.

With the two Demon Domain disciples slain, only one Sage-level warrior remained in Feng Jiutian’s faction. Under Lu Hantian’s assault, he struggled desperately. Though Lu Hantian fell short of Luo Tian and Sun Mengru’s prowess, he had once fought Luo Tian to a draw on Tongtian Mountain and was the head of one of Fire Domain’s three major sects. Thus, he far surpassed the Demon Domain’s lone Sage-level warrior.

Others had also crushed the Demon Domain’s forces, with Nan Gong Yuting transforming into an ocean of blood to overwhelm Li Maode. Li Maode was overwhelmed until Nan Gong Yuting’s crimson sword split him apart with a thousand blades of blood. The fifth warrior fell.

What surprised Luo Tian most was Zhou Wei of the Star Domain, whose face always bore a smile. He manifested as faint stardust, ethereal and elusive, clashing with the Demon Domain’s Shi Hongtu.

Shi Hongtu transformed into his true form—a massive lion, its roar shaking the heavens as if to devour Zhou Wei. With a single inhale, a crimson vortex erupted from Shi Hongtu’s maw, causing Zhou Wei to shift slightly.

Zhou Wei extended a finger, and points of stardust flickered. Each gesture conjured a star in his palm.

One hundred and eight stars, moving with strange trajectories across the sky, seemed chaotic yet imbued with profound mysteries that even Luo Tian perceived.

“Starlight Illuminates the Blue Sky!” Zhou Wei whispered, his hand sweeping outward. The one hundred and eighty stars blazed with searing light, illuminating the entire hall. A formless aura radiated from them, coalescing into a vast azure dragon within the realm of perception.

“Starlight Illuminates the Blue Sky! This Star Domain prodigy is no ordinary talent!” Diao Dezhu narrowed his eyes, gazing at Zhou Wei.

“What’s so special about this technique? It’s just a martial art, right?” Xu Liziye and others frowned, puzzled.

“Watch,” Diao Dezhu sighed, his expression pained. As a fellow of the Demon Domain, he had little enmity toward Shi Hongtu, but if the latter perished, it unsettled him.

“Hum…” The azure dragon coiled around Shi Hongtu, gradually sinking into his body.

“Hmph,” Shi Hongtu furrowed his brows, bewildered. Though Zhou Wei’s display had been grand, the azure dragon now entered his body without causing him harm. His blood energy remained robust, and his Sage power surged.

“Kid, what are you playing at? What trick is this?” Though unharmed, Shi Hongtu felt unease and demanded an answer.

“Hah! You’re still arrogant, letting the azure dragon bind you. Step back—should you move, I’ll end your life!” Zhou Wei smiled faintly, dismissing the stars and addressing Shi Hongtu.

“Are you mocking me?!” Shi Hongtu roared, charging forward again.

“This is your own doing. Don’t blame me!” Zhou Wei sensed the ferocious aura behind him, turned calmly, and smiled as he gestured, sending a surge of azure light.

Chapter 982: The Destiny of the Demon Weapon

Within the ancient celestial palace, Zhou Wei smiled as he turned to face Shi Hongtu charging toward him. He extended a hand, and stardust flared from his palm.

“You truly are reckless. I won’t kill you, but don’t think I’m a fool!” Zhou Wei chuckled, the stars flashing rapidly.

Luo Tian and others watched intently, eager to witness Shrouded Domain’s true power.

Shi Hongtu, like a bull, roared as he charged forward, his voice forming an invisible wave that surged toward Zhou Wei.

“Lion’s Roar!” Xu Liziye bellowed, excitement in his voice. He had heard of the Lion Ancestor’s unique technique—using sound to attack opponents.

“Starlight Illuminates the Blue Sky!” Zhou Wei spoke again, his voice calm. The stars spun wildly, dazzling even Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness, which could not discern their movement.

Suddenly, Luo Tian and others gaped in shock, staring at Shi Hongtu.

Shi Hongtu’s mountain-like form erupted with azure light, and even he was unaware of the transformation within his body. In an instant, he exploded into fragments of azure light, resembling stars scattering across the hall.

“What sorcery is this? It’s terrifying!” Xu Liziye and others stared, fear in their eyes.

Luo Tian narrowed his gaze at Zhou Wei, whose methods exceeded his comprehension.

“Hum…” The azure stars rose slowly, hovering above the hall like a fragment of heaven.

“I told you to let go. Why insist?” Zhou Wei’s face remained serene, shaking his head gently.

“Star Domain—kill without warning. Never let Star Domain’s people outwit you; you’ll never know how you die!” Diao Dezhu’s gaze was grave, his voice low.

After Diao Dezhu returned to the Demon Domain, Diao Yuanshan had warned him: one could defy the Divine Clan or the Underworld Domain, but never Star Domain. Even Diao Yuanshan’s power could not save him if he offended them, for Star Domain’s methods were unfathomable.

Luo Tian and others nodded solemnly, their gazes cautious. Xu Liziye even checked his body for signs of Star Domain’s tampering.

“This method is truly terrifying,” Luo Tian murmured, his mind awestruck. He had gained new insight and now longed to discover what other secrets the enigmatic Chaos Domain held.

“Pf!” As people marveled, Lu Hantian also felled the Underworld Domain’s warrior.

Feng Jiutian’s face darkened. Shi Hongtu, as the younger heir of the Eight Great Sage Clans’ Lion Ancestor, held a high status. To be killed by another was an outrage that would ignite the Lion Clan’s fury.

Feng Jiutian would have preferred to lose Long Yuhuan of the Dragon Clan, a mere genius with lesser status than Shi Hongtu.

But now he knew he had truly lost. Once the strongest faction, he was reduced to a handful of survivors, all in mortal danger and powerless against Luo Tian’s group.

“Luo Tian, are you determined to exterminate us?” Feng Jiutian’s face was grim. Du Hongtao had pressed him hard, but he still held on.

“Do you think I’d let this happen? You keep trying to kill me!” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smirk, refusing to halt the battle.

“You! Don’t push your luck—don’t blame me for burning with you!” Feng Jiutian’s voice deepened, his breath unsteady as he glared at Luo Tian.

“Oh?” Luo Tian’s expression shifted, intrigued. He hadn’t expected Feng Jiutian to have a secret weapon.

Diao Dezhu’s face darkened, pulling Luo Tian aside: “He must have a secret. The Eight Great Sage Clans are deep-rooted; the younger heir wouldn’t lack one. Even Shi Hongtu had one, though Star Domain’s prodigy was too cunning to use it.”

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded slightly. He hadn’t intended to exterminate them, so he addressed the group: “Enough—twenty-five are enough. Everyone, stop!”

Luo Tian’s words echoed. Shrouded Domain and Du Hongtao’s forces retreated to his side, while Star Domain and Divine Clan members returned to Zhou Wei and Sun Mengru.

The Demon Domain’s forces, pale-faced, transformed back into human forms behind Feng Jiutian. They glanced around, nearly crying—only Feng Jiutian and three other clans remained, totaling five people. All Sage-level warriors had perished; the remaining four were wounded.

“Twenty-four. Enough! Well done!” An elder appeared, but Long Jie remained unseen, leaving Luo Tian anxious.

The elder surveyed the group, his eyes gleaming with intensity. He pointed at Luo Tian: “You killed the most—good work, kid. You’re one!”

Luo Tian glanced at his head, where countless crimson halos hovered—countless. His lips twitched as he stepped forward.

“Him too!” The elder pointed at Zhou Wei, then Nan Gong Yuting and Sun Mengru, among others.

Five people stepped to the center—the strongest of this generation in Star and Divine Clans. Feng Jiutian, despite setbacks, was formidable; his ability to match Du Hongtao proved it.

They gazed at the bloodthirsty demon sword above, sighing inwardly. Acquiring this weapon was far harder than the Epoch Bell; thousands had fought, twenty-five survived—but only five secured the right. It was a prize won through others’ corpses.

“Alright, go. Simple—each of you approach and touch the sword. If it chooses you, you’re selected; if not, next. My old friend, you go first!” The elder pointed at Luo Tian, sending him to the sword.

Others’ faces darkened. Luo Tian had already claimed the Epoch Bell; now he was first to claim the demon weapon. If he succeeded, he’d possess two pseudo-Epoch Treasures—too absurd for圣地 (Holy Sects) to ignore.

“Haha!” Xu Liziye and Lu Hantian smiled, elated. Gaining another would be a blessing for both Star Domains.

Luo Tian eyed the sword, its blood energy still surging. He furrowed his brows, as if countless souls grinned at him. The overwhelming blood energy pressed against his mind, making him uncomfortable.

He grasped the hilt; instantly, the demon sword erupted with ten thousand feet of red light.

Next, blood runes flared from the blade, slithering like snakes across his hands, spreading through his body. They multiplied, enveloping him completely.

“Roar…” A dragon’s cry echoed as Luo Tian felt himself transported into another realm, his hand clutching a distant ancient dragon. It writhed desperately to escape, emitting rejection.

“After all this effort, I can’t waste it. If I don’t try, I’d be ungrateful for the lives I’ve taken!” Luo Tian muttered, golden light flickering in darkness. His arms bulged with veins as he clutched the dragon tightly.

“Crash…” The dragon sensed Luo Tian’s tenacity, roaring and turning blood-red. Its massive body twisted violently, breaking free, slamming Luo Tian against the dark walls repeatedly.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed, blood spewing from his mouth as he felt himself disintegrating. Pain ravaged his body.

“Kid, give up—rejection means you’re unfit. If not for my old friend’s sake, I wouldn’t have told you. Be careful or you’ll lose your life!” The elder’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, earning a bitter smile.

“Ah… I was greedy,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. A pseudo-Epoch Treasure—such power, obtaining one was already lucky; two? That required divine fortune.

He loosened his grip, and the blood dragon bolted like a wild horse, vanishing from his sight.

The crowd watched Luo Tian anxiously. The blood runes faded slowly, and he emerged pale-faced.

“Failed,” Luo Tian shook his head, returning to the group. Xu Liziye’s expression fell; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to fail.

“Ah… it seems no luck. The treasure will remain sealed!” Xu Liziye muttered, unconvinced others would succeed.

“I’ll try,” Nan Gong Yuting stepped forward, gazing at the bloodthirsty sword.

Nan Gong Yuting took a step forward, appearing before the crimson demon weapon instantly. His eyes narrowed; without hesitation, he grasped the hilt like Luo Tian.

Nan Gong Yuting’s body radiated blood energy, as if a death god from hell. His presence alongside the sword seemed fitting.

He grasped the blood weapon, and the runes flared again, enveloping him. His form vanished from sight.

“This kid’s blood energy is strong—perhaps he’ll succeed!” Xu Liziye and others looked at Nan Gong Yuting with hope.

“Not sure. This bloodthirsty weapon is sinister; it’s about luck, not strength,” Luo Tian said solemnly, hoping Nan Gong Yuting would claim it.

As the crowd watched, Nan Gong Yuting’s form emerged, his face disappointed but not as battered as Luo Tian. He shook his head.

“Ah… failed. Ah… pseudo-Epoch Treasure, so close!” Diao Dezhu and others cried out, their disappointment palpable.

Yet the crowd sensed Nan Gong Yuting’s aura had changed dramatically, especially his blood energy now denser than before.

“Just a step away from the early Sage stage!” Luo Tian smiled, sensing Nan Gong Yuting’s power. He was at the same level as Sun Mengru; after passing the Sage Trial, he’d become an early Sage.

Feng Jiutian’s eyes gleamed, his gaze on the bloodthirsty sword. Greed flickered in his expression. Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuting had failed; Sun Mengru would never succeed—her Divine Body clashed with the weapon.

The only one worth noting was Zhou Wei of Star Domain, whose earlier display had stunned Feng Jiutian. His methods were unnervingly sinister.

Indeed, Sun Mengru hadn’t even tried, standing still. Zhou Wei’s face remained serene as he gestured for Feng Jiutian to proceed.

“Since you killed the Lion Ancestor’s younger heir, let you go first!” Zhou Wei smiled gently, as if he’d merely crushed an ant.

The more Zhou Wei acted this way, the higher Luo Tian’s regard for him grew—his mystery deepened. Everyone eyed Zhou Wei with caution.

“Good,” Feng Jiutian’s face lit up. Now the Demon Domain was weak in this ancient palace, so he dared not be too bold.

He soared toward the sword and vanished from sight. Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, especially Diao Dezhu, who had long been at odds with Feng Jiutian. If Feng Jiutian claimed the weapon, Diao Dezhu would feel humiliated.

“Zhou Xiong, do you think Feng Jiutian can claim this weapon?” Luo Tian smiled, asking Zhou Wei.

Hearing Luo Tian’s question, everyone turned to Zhou Wei, their expressions puzzled. Zhou Wei’s current strength made him respected, second only to Luo Tian and Sun Mengru. The more enigmatic he was, the more terrifying and feared he became.

Hearing Luo Tian’s question, Zhou Wei smiled mysteriously, his eyes sparkling with stars: “This weapon is destined for me!”

“Hiss…” The crowd gasped, staring at Zhou Wei. They hadn’t expected him to predict this—though his earlier gesture of letting Feng Jiutian go had hinted at confidence.

But now, Zhou Wei openly affirmed it, declaring the weapon was his—leaving everyone stunned.

The Demon Domain’s people looked grim. Though they doubted Zhou Wei’s words, their hearts trembled; even Luo Tian had failed.

A phoenix’s cry echoed suddenly, drawing everyone’s gaze to the sky. Blood energy surged wildly, forming a crimson phoenix illusion that enveloped the weapon, shaking everyone’s minds. The Demon Domain’s people looked expectantly.

“An omen!” They gasped, excitement in their eyes. Neither Luo Tian nor Nan Gong Yuting had seen an omen; now Feng Jiutian’s display was clear—his chances of subduing the weapon were high.

“Roar…” A dragon’s cry shook the heavens, a blood-red dragon rising into the air. It clashed with the crimson phoenix in the hall, entwining violently.

The two massive forms—blood dragon and phoenix—surged with blood energy, as if rivals. Their collision sent tremors through the hall.

The crimson phoenix was invincible, but the blood dragon was a pseudo-Epoch Treasure’s power. Its might shocked everyone as it swept its tail, scattering the phoenix illusion.

“Roar…” Though defeated, the blood dragon bore injuries; scales fell off, turning into blood mist that drifted through the hall.

The runes flared again, and Feng Jiutian emerged pale-faced, his eyes filled with deep regret.

“Almost there… just a step more!” Feng Jiutian muttered, releasing the weapon. His hands trembled as he placed it before the Demon Domain’s people.

“Failed!” No need to guess; everyone knew Feng Jiutian had failed, relieving Diao Dezhu and others.

But Luo Tian’s gaze was deep as he watched Feng Jiutian, noticing a crimson mark on his forehead—fleeting.

“Though failed, he must have gained much,” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He turned to Zhou Wei, smiling.

Now only Zhou Wei remained. If he succeeded, Luo Tian could accept it—since their friendship had always been amicable.

Others also gazed at Zhou Wei, recalling his words earlier—hope in their eyes.

The Demon Domain’s people, however, wore scornful expressions, eyeing Zhou Wei. Luo Tian, Nan Gong Yuting, and Feng Jiutian had all failed; this weapon was notoriously hard to subdue. Zhou Wei’s earlier boasts were clear, but they thought his methods were sinister—yet subduing a weapon that even Luo Tian and three others failed to master was still daunting.

Zhou Wei’s face remained serene as he moved toward the bloodthirsty sword, his eyes filled with calculation. He didn’t rush to grasp it but instead traced the weapon’s surroundings, his hands forming seals. At each step, he pointed a finger, and stardust appeared around the weapon.

“Fooling around!” The Demon Domain’s people muttered, disdain in their voices. Star Domain’s three members glared at them, causing the latter to shudder—recalling Zhou Wei’s earlier mystique.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows; Zhou Wei’s display of killing Shi Hongtu had awed him. He hadn’t known nine domains held such methods—unheard of before.

Now Zhou Wei became a blur, like a storm of azure light, his form indistinct. Simultaneously, stars flickered around the weapon.

After a while, starlight illuminated the hall again. Zhou Wei, sweat on his brow, emerged from sight.

Zhou Wei said nothing, smiling confidently as he grasped the bloodthirsty sword.

“Hum…” Blood runes enveloped his body, and he vanished from sight.

The roaring sounds returned, accompanied by Zhou Wei’s earlier stardust—gradually merging into the blood runes.

“Deceitful Heaven’s Art! Lord, you’ve used Deceitful Heaven’s Art!” Star Domain members gasped, their voices trembling with excitement.

“Deceitful Heaven’s Art!” Divine Clan members stared, their expressions shocked at the blood runes surrounding Zhou Wei.

“Is it Star Domain’s lost Deceitful Heaven’s Art? What is this Zhou Wei’s origin?” Sun Feiwen looked astonished, speaking aloud.

“Deceitful Heaven’s Art?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. The Four Sacred Stars and Fire Domain had little contact with Star Domain, so they didn’t know this art. But from its name and the Divine Clan’s reaction, it was extraordinary.

“Deceitful Heaven’s Art—its essence lies in the word ‘deceit.’ If mastered, even Heaven itself can be deceived!” Sun Mengru explained to Luo Tian and others.

“Hiss…” Luo Tian and others gasped, their eyes wide with shock. They hadn’t expected Zhou Wei to wield such an absurd technique.

Heaven, though elusive, was a supreme existence. To deceive it proved the art’s absurdity.

“Now I understand why my grandfather warned me not to offend Star Domain—these people can even deceive Heaven! Who could they not outwit?” Diao Dezhu’s lips twitched, his gaze on the blood runes.

After stardust merged with the blood runes, the roaring sounds gradually faded, even giving a sense of gentleness.

“Success?” Luo Tian and others gazed at the blood runes peeling away, revealing Zhou Wei’s composed face.

“I said this weapon was destined for me!” Zhou Wei spoke calmly, his confidence unshaken. The blood runes faded into his body.

Chapter 984: The Path of Heaven’s Mandate

In the third layer of the ancient celestial palace, everyone gazed at Zhou Wei holding the demon weapon. His face bore a serene smile, his aura calm and composed. The bloodthirsty sword radiated an eerie red glow, its power sending shivers through the crowd.

Zhou Wei’s aura contrasted sharply with the weapon, yet it gradually calmed under his touch. Blood energy receded.

“Success!” People’s expressions varied, their gazes on the weapon now returning to its essence.

“Bloodthirsty Demon Sword—drawn only when blood is spilled!” An old voice echoed, laced with regret. The third-layer guardian appeared before the crowd.

“This Bloodthirsty Demon Sword was cultivated for countless years, nourished by the blood of nine domains’ prodigies. Its blade cuts through oceans of blood! If it doesn’t spill enemy blood, it will devour its master’s life force. Be prepared—when you use it, drink the enemy’s blood; otherwise, your own will be spilled!” The elder spoke, gazing at all.

“Though you used a trick to claim it, I honor my word and won’t reclaim it. Take care,” the elder said before vanishing, his previous sinister aura gone.

People stared in awe at Zhou Wei’s Bloodthirsty Demon Sword, a pseudo-Epoch Treasure so powerful it even devoured its master.

Zhou Wei showed no concern, bowing to Luo Tian before shouldering the sword and returning to Star Domain’s group.

Star Domain was elated, though the weapon had drawbacks. Still, it was a pseudo-Epoch Treasure—its acquisition would bolster Star Domain’s strength.

As the elder vanished, the hall returned to calmness. Blood energy faded, golden light flickering through the air, illuminating the hall and revealing the ground littered with piles of bones—Sages and superiors.

Now people fully understood how many had died, the hall nearly entirely bones—layer upon layer.

“This is how many perished to forge this Bloodthirsty Demon Sword!” Tian Luo murmured, his voice filled with awe.

“Yet they were all prodigies’ blood—this is the most terrifying!” Xiu added, his face wary as he gazed at Zhou Wei’s back.

The Bloodthirsty Sword resembled Nan Gong Yuting’s, but its power was incomparably greater.

With the third-layer battle concluded, those entering the ancient palace dwindled to twenty-something. The Demon Domain was annihilated; so was the Thunder Domain. The Demon Domain suffered heavy losses, leaving people in awe.

“Indeed, the Sages’ Tomb lives up to its name!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Thousands had fought, but only twenty-four remained—this trial was truly legendary.

And this was just the third layer. Luo Tian didn’t know how many more lay ahead, a strange feeling stirring within him—regret for letting everyone enter.

His greatest worry was Long Jie, who had vanished after being taken by that elder. That elder’s odd personality left Luo Tian uncertain—what did he mean by “old friend”? Many strange people called their enemies “old friends.”

“Let’s go. We don’t know what dangers await,” Luo Tian sighed, addressing the group.

Others felt heavy-hearted, gazing at the door leading to the next level. A suffocating atmosphere filled their hearts—what peril awaited them?

“Survive,” Luo Tian said, his voice laced with helplessness. In this ancient palace, he truly doubted if he could protect everyone’s lives.

“Luo Xiong, if there’s another pseudo-Epoch Treasure in the next trial, I hope you find a chance to claim it. Don’t let emotions cloud your judgment!” Three early Sage-stage Divine Clan elders watched Luo Tian’s group vanish, their faces carrying slight annoyance.

In terms of strength within this ancient palace, the Divine Clan was unquestionably first—Sun Mengru’s Divine Body, three early Sage-stage warriors, and Sun Feiwen, the Divine Clan’s prince. Even if Luo Tian’s group fought, they wouldn’t match these forces. Yet two pseudo-Epoch Treasures had gone unclaimed, causing the Divine Clan some resentment.

The second Bloodthirsty Demon Sword was irrelevant; the Divine Clan couldn’t claim it due to opposing natures. The first Epoch Bell had Sun Mengru’s chance, but she’d given it to Luo Tian.

That wasn’t a problem, but the Divine Clan feared Sun Mengru might have feelings for Luo Tian. If true, it would be terrifying—Luo Tian was so exceptional; Sun Mengru had matured, and romantic feelings were natural.

Divine Clan’s “Holy Maiden” couldn’t marry, a law set by the old Divine King. The Divine Clan revered the old king as a god, obeying without question. Moreover, Luo Tian was an enemy and foe of the Divine Clan.

“My affairs don’t concern you. Do your part!” Sun Mengru sneered, lifting her foot and stepping into the golden door.

“We only wished to warn you—no offense to the Holy Maiden!” The three elders bowed, watching Sun Mengru enter.

“What’s there to be proud of? In the end…” One Divine Clan half-Sage disciple sneered, but the three elders fixed their gaze on him.

“Smack!” Sun Feiwen’s hand swung, striking the disciple across the face.

“Don’t say what shouldn’t be said. If your words reach the Holy Maiden, don’t blame me for turning against you!” Sun Feiwen’s cold gaze and anger filled his voice.

The three elders also frowned, speaking softly: “If this happens again, it’s a crime against the clan—nine generations executed!”

The disciple shivered but said nothing, trembling behind them as they entered the golden door.

“Divine Clan’s Holy Maiden—do they all end in misfortune? Interesting!” Zhou Wei smiled, leading Star Domain’s group into the golden door.

“Though I didn’t claim the Bloodthirsty Demon Sword, it coincidentally completed my Nine Transformations of Rebirth. When I reach the early Sage stage, I’ll become an immortal phoenix—then I’ll make you all regret it! Luo Tian, Divine Body, Zhou Wei! You’ll pay!” Feng Jiutian’s face was cold as he watched Luo Tian’s group enter the door, his voice icy.

“Jiutian! You’ve entered the Nine Transformations of Rebirth!” Other young Demon Domain warriors gaped, their faces turning to joy.

Phoenix Rebirth—eternal soul, immortal. The凤 (Feng) Clan’s Nine Transformations of Rebirth was their clan’s birthright, passed down through bloodline. After nine transformations, the Feng Clan became nearly immortal—more terrifying than a Sage’s blood-rebirth.

“Indeed, when I reach the early Sage stage, my Nine Transformations will complete. According to Long Zhan Tian’s report from the ancient palace, the next pseudo-Epoch Treasure is the Heaven’s Mandate Map. Whoever claims it will dominate the next trial. I’ll make them forever lost in the Heaven’s Mandate Map.”

“That Long Clan kid is no ordinary talent. His pressure on us is too great. I suspect he’s a descendant of Long Zhan Tian, even possessing all his bloodline power.” Long Yuhuan’s face was serious, causing the Demon Domain’s warriors to frown.

“Indeed, we must find a way to eliminate him. Otherwise, if he grows strong, he’ll be another Long Zhan Tian. I don’t want the Demon Domain’s lord to be a brash kid, a dog of the Four Sacred Stars.” Feng Jiutian mused.

“If we encounter that kid, kill him at all costs—reveal your secret techniques if needed. Otherwise, he’ll remain a threat,” the younger heir of the Golden Winged Great Peng Clan spoke.

“That Long kid is too strong. I suspect he’s a descendant of Long Zhan Tian, even possessing all his bloodline power.” Long Yuhuan’s face was serious, causing the Demon Domain’s warriors to frown.

“Indeed, we must find a way to eliminate him. Otherwise, if he grows strong, he’ll be another Long Zhan Tian. I don’t want the Demon Domain’s lord to be a brash kid, a dog of the Four Sacred Stars.” Feng Jiutian mused.

“If we encounter that kid, kill him at all costs—reveal your secret techniques if needed. Otherwise, he’ll remain a threat,” the younger heir of the Golden Winged Great Peng Clan spoke.

“Long Yuhuan, are you reluctant? After all, he’s a Dragon Clan member!” They gazed at Long Yuhuan, who was deep in thought.

“What are you thinking? I’m considering if I could turn him into another Long Zhan Tian by refining him! Then our brothers wouldn’t fear anyone!” Long Yuhuan’s face showed admiration.

“Haha, good! If we capture him and kill him, we’ll refine him together. That would be a great treasure—comparable to ancestral blood!” They laughed, already planning how to refine him before even capturing Long Jie.
