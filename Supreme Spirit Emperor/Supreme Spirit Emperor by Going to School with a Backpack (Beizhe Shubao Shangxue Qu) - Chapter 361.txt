" What is this! " Zhuge Huangchao's face suddenly changed, his body trembling uncontrollably under the pressure of this aura.

Not only Zhuge Huangchao, but also Zhuge Jie and even Zhuge Qingtian were startled. They quickly summoned the staff of the Epoch Treasure, surrounding themselves with it.

" Lu Xiong, wait! " Yan Hongtao quickly spoke, watching the overwhelming aura radiating from Lu Tian's palm. He leapt into the air and stood behind Lu Tian, his mind trembling even more.

Zhou Wei finally showed emotion, joining Yan Hongtao with a look of shock as they gazed at the green-gold aura in Lu Tian's hand.

" Why do you insist on this! " Lu Tian's face was pale, his eyes fixed on Zhuge Qingtian with a hint of ferocity.

" Lu Tian, quickly retrieve it! I don't want my master's inheritance! " Zhuge Qingtian roared, but even with the Epoch Treasure protecting him, he felt that if this aura touched him, he would not survive.

" It's too late! We've already warned you before, but now we can't control it. We can only choose a direction! " Sun Kemin's eyes gleamed with triumph as he looked at Zhuge Qingtian, rarely seeing a disciple of the Primordial Lord so terrified.

" So, one side must die. Do you choose me to die or you? " Lu Tian's face twisted with ferocity as he addressed Zhuge Qingtian.

" This situation is entirely your fault, don't blame others! " Lu Tian shouted loudly, feeling his control over the immortal energy slipping. He extended his hand and pushed this thread of opportunity toward Zhuge Qingtian and the others.

" What should we do! " Zhuge Huangchao's face was filled with fear, feeling death approaching step by step. Not walking but flying toward him.

Apocalyptic energy instantly transformed into a golden ripple, sweeping toward Zhuge Qingtian and the others like an apocalypse. It immediately appeared on the barrier of the Epoch Treasure.

" Crack... " A sharp sound rose instantly. The barrier under the Epoch Treasure was so solid, but it was pierced like a piece of paper by this thread of opportunity.

" It's over! " Zhuge Huangchao and the others stared at the golden aura approaching them, their eyes filled with terror.

" What kind of power is this? Why does it feel even superior to the Epoch Power! " Yan Hongtao's body trembled as he watched the barrier under the staff shatter, exclaiming in disbelief.

" Could it be... belonging to immortals? " Zhou Wei's eyes flashed with light, speaking loudly but his expression was filled with disbelief.

" You're right. It definitely doesn't belong to the Nine Domains! It belongs to immortals! " Sun Kemin's eyes gleamed with triumph. His body also contained a thread of immortal energy, which he had never dared to use before.

Zhuge Qingtian and the others turned pale, unable to resist such overwhelming power, they could only stand there waiting for death.

" Thousand zhang... hundred zhang..." In the blink of an eye, this aura reached their vicinity, leaving them completely desperate.

" Let me suppress it! " Zhuge Qingtian tried one last fight, spitting out a mouthful of blood onto the staff.

" Hum... " The humming echoed, and under Zhuge Qingtian's desperate effort, the gray staff emitted waves of gray energy. A gray figure gradually formed, its eyes cold.

" This is the projection of the Primordial Lord within the staff! " Lu Tian frowned slightly but then relaxed.

Although the apparition of the Primordial Lord was powerful, it was only an illusion and still had a gap compared to true immortal energy.

But just as Lu Tian was about to relax, another disturbance occurred elsewhere. The source of the disturbance came from the massive stone statue of the Primordial Lord.

The apparition of the Primordial Lord seemed to sense something, instantly appearing outside the statue and then entering it. A massive wave of gray energy burst out, forming a swirling vortex with immense suction force.

The immortal thread Lu Tian had summoned was also pulled by this suction, changing direction and heading straight for the statue of the Primordial Lord.

" Boom... " The gray statue was destroyed instantly by this immortal thread, merging into the swirling vortex of chaos.

" Damned! " Lu Tian's face turned even paler, never expecting such a twist.

The humming echoed again. From the swirling vortex, it seemed to have absorbed and fused with this immortal thread. Under the shock of Lu Tian and others, a middle-aged man emerged from the gray vortex, his face solemn with a smile. An overwhelming aura radiated from him, and his appearance was identical to the statue of the Primordial Lord.

" Master! " Zhuge Qingtian's face was filled with excitement as he gazed at this tangible figure and immediately knelt down.

" Greetings to the Primordial Lord! " Zhuge Jie and Zhuge Huangchao's faces were also filled with excitement, feeling an irresistible aura from this man.

" Alive... the Epoch Lord? " Sun Kemin trembled as he spoke, his eyes filled with disbelief. He stared at the solemn man, fear in his eyes. They had almost killed his only disciple just now.

" Greetings to the Primordial Lord! " Lu Tian quickly led everyone, bowing respectfully to this man. In front of such a being, he knew there was no room for resistance.

The middle-aged man nodded and then turned his gaze to the ground, where the blood of Sun Miechen was gradually fading.

" Regrettable! " A solemn voice came from the Primordial Lord, then suddenly he extended his hand. A series of gray symbols flew out from his hands and merged into Sun Miechen's blood.

In an instant, a shocking sight appeared before Lu Tian and others. After the gray symbols were absorbed into Sun Miechen's blood, the fading divine essence miraculously stopped and even began to rise.

" Hum... " Under Lu Tian's shocked gaze, golden divine blood slowly coalesced and emitted an intense vitality. Finally, Sun Miechen's figure appeared in the sight of Lu Tian and others.

" Thank you, Primordial Lord! " Sun Miechen's eyes were also filled with shock as he gazed at the gray-cloaked Primordial Lord, never expecting to be revived.

" Powerful! This is the power of the Primordial Lord! " Lu Tian and others were deeply shocked, never expecting the Primordial Lord to be so extraordinary, even saving someone who had used a forbidden technique.

" I can sense the immortal energy on you. Have you consumed immortal pills? " The Primordial Lord's eyes showed a hint of amusement, then he turned his gaze to Lu Tian and Sun Kemin.

" Yes! " Lu Tian's face showed respect, not daring to resist and directly confessed the truth.

" Fortunately, this immortal energy allowed me to reach such a state! " The Primordial Lord sighed deeply, gazing into the distance with an expression of melancholy.

" Master, are you... revived? " Zhuge Qingtian's eyes were filled with excitement as he gazed at the Primordial Lord, his voice trembling.

" Revived? How easy! I merely merged with this energy and now have this state. But it won't last long! " The Primordial Lord smiled lightly, gazing at Zhuge Qingtian.

" I never expected you to appear in this epoch! " The Primordial Lord's gaze softened as he looked at Zhuge Qingtian.

" Master, I am unworthy! I let your inheritance fall into others' hands! " Zhuge Qingtian knelt again, his eyes filled with intense regret.

" It's fine. Actually, I never wanted you to follow my inheritance. After all, since ancient times, every Epoch Lord has forged their own path. What others pass on is always another's! " The Primordial Lord smiled carelessly, then shook his head.

" I can sense this epoch is different. You shouldn't be enemies, the ancient royal clans and the descendants of the old kings are your real enemies! " The Primordial Lord continued, scanning Lu Tian and others.

These nine people could represent the strongest in the Nine Domains, so the Primordial Lord spoke this way.

" Go back! The ancient royal clans have awakened, and you don't have much time left! " The Primordial Lord looked into the distance and said to Lu Tian and others.

" What! " Hearing the Primordial Lord's words, Lu Tian and others were shocked. Never expecting the Primordial Lord to reveal such a major secret.

" Yes, the depths of the Chaos Abyss are still not suitable for you to enter now. Wait until your strength is enough, then you can go and take a look! " The Primordial Lord continued to persuade Lu Tian and others to leave.

" Yes! " With the Primordial Lord's advice, they had no desire to continue deeper. They were also worried about their sanctuaries being invaded by the ancient royal clans.

" Alright, my time is limited. I've managed to reach this state, so let me buy you some more time! " The Primordial Lord spoke softly and didn't mention Lu Tian's previous intention to kill Zhuge Qingtian.

" These ancient royal clans still need powerful means of intimidation! " The Primordial Lord muttered to himself, then waved his hands. A strong fluctuation spread from the chaos within him. Then the Primordial Lord's body collapsed, transforming into a vast wave of gray energy hovering above everyone's heads.

" I will try to buy you some time, and strive to improve as much as possible. There are still great battles waiting for you! " The Primordial Lord's voice echoed in Lu Tian and others' minds, causing their bodies to tremble.

" Hum... " The gray energy gradually changed, finally transforming into a massive hand that covered the sky, flying out of the cave space.

Chapter 1449: Authority ()

At the edge of the Thunder Domain, several aged figures stood with solemn expressions, gazing at the thunder domain radiating wild energy.

These old men were Diao Yuanshan, Sun Shengtian, Zhuge Chaos, and other elder warriors. Opposite them were dozens of peak-level elders from the ancient royal clans.

Opposite Diao Yuanshan and others were dozens of peak-level elders from the royal clans, standing in the thunder domain with mockery in their eyes as they gazed at Diao Yuanshan and others.

The two sides had been in a standoff for nearly seven days, discussing how to coexist afterward.

" The human race must submit to the ancient royal clans; there's no room for negotiation! " A peak-level elder from the Fei clan spoke, his voice carrying a strong tone.

" Yes, for so long, the human race has monopolized the Nine Domains. It's time to reclaim it! " Other elders from the ancient royal clans also looked down on Diao Yuanshan and others with disdain.

" What's the point of negotiating? I think the human race doesn't even have a peak-level strength now. We can just crush them! " Dozens of ancient royal clan elders kept shouting, from the beginning of negotiations they had demanded submission without treating the human race as equals.

" The human race has accumulated many resources over the years. You want to occupy us? That's impossible! We can make appropriate concessions, allowing all races to live together in the Nine Domains. But submission is absolutely impossible! " Elder God-King Sun Shengtian, with the Divine Emperor Sword hovering above his head, gazed at the dozens of peak-level elders and spoke solemnly.

Diao Yuanshan, Zhuge Chaos, Yan Xiuluo and others also summoned the Epoch Treasures, carefully watching the royal clan elders, fearing they might suddenly attack.

" Hmph! The Epoch Treasures! What's next? Are you going to fight us? " A peak-level elder from the Blood Clan scoffed but his eyes slightly tightened.

" You humans have Epoch Treasures, and we royal clans also have the Kings' Weapons. The Epoch Treasures aren't a reason for us not to attack you humans. Show your true strength, or one day we'll definitely flatten you! " Fu Wenbin spoke, scanning the group.

Because of Lu Tian's presence, Fu Wenbin didn't hold as much hatred for the Four Saints Star Domain lineage. However, he still viewed other lineages with intense hostility.

" No need for much. If you can produce five peak-level strengths now, we might consider not attacking the human race! " Several royal clan elders looked down on Diao Yuanshan and others with disdain.

" Damned! " Diao Yuanshan and others' faces were grim, if they had five peak-level strengths, they wouldn't have come here to negotiate with the royal clans.

The situation was immediately stalled. The ancient royal clan side looked down on Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian with disdain. Since they had brought the Epoch Treasures, the royal clan's peak-level elders also knew they couldn't keep Diao Yuanshan and others. Their Kings' Weapons hadn't been taken out of the Origin Domain.

" Boom... " As both sides were in a stalemate, a thunderous sound echoed throughout the star domain. A powerful aura instantly spread into people's minds, causing both sides to change their expressions abruptly.

" What is that? " Soon after, they discovered the source of this terrifying aura.

Under the star domain, a massive gray hand pushed through space toward the thunder domain with a booming sound. The overwhelming aura made the entire star field tremble, and scenes of destruction were terrifying.

" What kind of attack is this? Who summoned it? Could it be the human race's Epoch Lord! " Dozens of peak-level royal clan elders showed fear, gazing at the gray hand approaching them and crushing the heavens.

" It's our human race's Epoch Lord! I never expected our human race to still have an Epoch Lord! " Sun Shengtian and Diao Yuanshan's eyes showed excitement. Never expected the human race to have an Epoch Lord after being forced into such a desperate situation.

" Ha! What are the ancient royal clans? In front of our human race's Epoch Lord, they're still crushed! " Yan Xiuluo laughed loudly, gazing at the dozens of peak-level royal clan elders with fear in their eyes. He felt a sense of revenge.

These ancient royal clans had always looked down on the human race since negotiations began, treating them as nothing. Now, under the attack of the human race's Epoch Lord, they were trembling and completely different from before.

" Damned! How could there be an Epoch Lord in this epoch! " Dozens of peak-level elders showed disbelief, but seeing the gray hand and its overwhelming aura, it was definitely an Epoch Lord. It wasn't something the Epoch Treasures could emit.

The gray hand crushed nine heavens and ten earths, booming through space as if the entire star field had only this one gray hand.

" Boom... " The heavy bell sound echoed, and the ancient chaos bell on Zhuge Chaos's head emitted a series of bell sounds. Invisible fluctuations spread outward, naturally flying from Zhuge Chaos's head toward the gray hand.

" Is it the Primordial Lord? " Diao Yuanshan and others showed respect, watching the ancient chaos bell gradually approaching the gray hand.

" Boom... " In an instant, under people's shock, the gray hand collided with the ancient chaos bell. A thunderous sound echoed throughout the star field.

Time seemed to stop, and in this moment, only this bell sound existed across the ages.

Invisible fluctuations immediately spread with the powerful bell sound throughout the star field, destroying everything and leaving no material in its path.

" Damned! " Dozens of ancient royal clan elders' faces were grim, a powerful sense of death immediately invading their minds.

" Block it! " Dozens of peak-level elders combined forces, constantly using barriers to surround themselves.

But Diao Yuanshan and others couldn't even raise a hand against this overwhelming pressure, standing there watching the terrifying fluctuations approach them.

" We're done for! I don't know if these royal clan elders will die, but we are definitely dead! " Yan Xiuluo's eyes showed bitterness as he spoke.

Diao Yuanshan and others' faces were also grim, never expecting things to turn out this way. It was truly unexpected.

As they thought, the fluctuation that could destroy everything instantly swept over their bodies. However, to their surprise, this terrifying fluctuation didn't harm them at all.

" No harm? " Yan Xiuluo's face showed confusion, watching the star field wiped out by the fluctuation. The swirling void currents hit their bodies.

" Unbelievable! Thank you, Primordial Lord! " Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian showed respect, bowing to the ancient chaos bell.

Compared to Diao Yuanshan's ease, these peak-level royal clan elders weren't so lucky. Originally strong, but under this terrifying fluctuation, they trembled.

" Boom... boom... boom... " Layers of powerful barriers were instantly cut open like a piece of paper under this terrifying fluctuation.

Dozens of peak-level royal clan elders had combined forces to set up barriers, but in an instant, they were all gone. The fluctuation swept over the dozens of peak-level royal clan elders.

Blood splattered, and powerful blood scattered across the star field. Dozens of peak-level elders instantly disappeared from Diao Yuanshan's sight.

The power swept through, annihilating dozens of peak-level elders before continuing toward the depths of the thunder domain.

The fluctuation spread, and one by one, the ancient royal clan elders were annihilated under this terrifying fluctuation. Blood once again filled the thunder domain.

It pushed through several million miles before finally stopping, leaving Diao Yuanshan and others with shocked expressions.

" Cough... " A series of blood凝聚 appeared, dozens of peak-level elders gathered in the star field. Their cultivation dropped to the late epoch stage, their faces pale with fear.

" We were just one step away! Just one step and we wouldn't have held on! " The group exchanged glances, a sense of fear they had never experienced before spreading through their hearts.

" The human race really has an Epoch Lord! " Fu Wenbin's eyes showed respect, gazing at the ancient chaos bell still emitting gray energy.

The ancient royal clans respected strength; an Epoch Lord of the human race was every bit as powerful as a king, worthy of their respect.

" Hum... " A series of fluctuations rose, and gray energy gradually凝聚 in the star field.

" All races coexist! " The gray energy continuously凝聚, four powerful characters with an overwhelming aura appeared in the star field. They were firm and unshakable, leaving no doubt that this was indeed the handwriting of an Epoch Lord.

" Respect the Primordial Lord's decree! " Diao Yuanshan and others bowed respectfully, their eyes filled with excitement.

The dozens of royal clan elders showed a look of resentment. They had always believed the ancient royal clans ruled supreme, but now an unexpected Primordial Lord appeared.

There was no choice; even if the human race had a near-Epoch Lord, they wouldn't fear it. But now this was a true Epoch Lord; the ancient royal clans had no chance of flattening the human race unless a true king emerged from their ranks.

" We're leaving! " The dozens of peak-level royal clan elders exchanged glances, then bowed to the ancient chaos bell before heading toward the depths of the thunder domain.

" Should we keep them? " Yan Xiuluo's eyes showed killing intent, gazing at the dozens of elders who had dropped in cultivation. The blood on their heads emitted a continuous humming sound.

At this moment, the human race had an Epoch Lord supporting them and also possessed the Epoch Treasures. It wasn't impossible to keep these dozen peak-level elders of the ancient royal clans.

Chapter 1450: Forward ()

" You want to keep us? " Hearing Yan Xiuluo's words, the dozens of peak-level royal clan elders' faces changed abruptly. Their eyes showed disdain as they turned to gaze at Diao Yuanshan and others.

" Forget it! " Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian exchanged glances, sighed deeply. They knew the royal clans were also extremely powerful, especially these dozens of old men. If they messed up, they might not know how many lives would be lost.

" You're wise! " The dozens of old men sneered, then their bodies flickered and flew toward the depths of the thunder domain.

" Even after being defeated by the Primordial Lord, what's there to be arrogant about! " Yan Xiuluo showed disdain, watching the old men disappear.

" Let's go! At least for a long time, they won't dare to act recklessly! " Diao Yuanshan and others sighed, then flew toward the thunder domain. They wanted to confirm whether the Primordial Lord was still alive.

...

In the Chaos Abyss, Lu Tian and others looked at each other in confusion, standing in the cave space of the Primordial Lord.

" Let's go! " Zhuge Qingtian's face was resolute as he addressed Zhuge Jie and Zhuge Huangchao. The Primordial Lord's words were trustworthy, and since his inheritance had been taken by others, there was no need to continue.

" We should go too; I don't know what the situation is in the Nine Domains now! " Sun Miechen's eyes showed admiration, his gaze toward Lu Tian was calm.

After being resurrected, Sun Miechen's mindset had changed completely, but his aura remained formidable.

" Yes! " Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao nodded, obviously not wanting to continue walking forward. They wanted to explore the depths of the Chaos Abyss and return to their star domains to check on their own situations.

" Brother, what do we do? " Long Jie looked at Lu Tian, as Lu Tian's goal was the Magnetic Immortal Light. His mission wasn't complete yet, so he couldn't leave.

" You go with them; I'll continue alone! " Lu Tian addressed Long Jie and Sun Kemin, his voice resolute.

" Let's go together! " Sun Kemin obviously didn't trust Lu Tian and decided to accompany him, exploring the depths of the Chaos Abyss.

" Yes, brother, we can watch out for each other! " Long Jie also wanted to accompany Lu Tian.

" We can't be separated! " Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan's faces showed determination. After reuniting with Lu Tian, the two women didn't want to part so soon, especially in the Chaos Abyss where one misstep could mean death.

" We'll take our leave! " As Lu Tian and others were discussing, Zhuge Qingtian and Sun Miechen bowed to Lu Tian, indicating they wanted to leave.

" Yes, until we meet again! I hope when I come out, the Nine Domains will be under your care! " Lu Tian smiled.

" You should go back too, Long Jie. Now that the ancient royal clans have awakened, you can't ignore it! " Lu Tian looked at Zhuge Qingtian and others leaving, then turned to Long Jie.

" Brother Sun, go back too! Watch over the Four Saints Star Domain for me! " Lu Tian addressed Sun Kemin, his voice carrying a request. He handed the Yin Fish to Sun Kemin's hands.

" I... " Sun Kemin was about to speak, but Long Jie pulled him back and shook his head. Long Jie knew that once Lu Tian made a decision, no one could change it.

" Alright, brother be careful! Prioritize safety! " Long Jie nodded and gave Lu Tian some advice.

" And you two! " Then Lu Tian looked at Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan, his eyes showing a bitter smile.

In his heart, Lu Tian didn't want to part with the two women, but the Chaos Abyss was too dangerous. He truly didn't want them to risk their lives for him.

However, it was these two women who made Lu Tian the most difficult to deal with. Seeing the determination in Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan's eyes, Lu Tian knew that sending them back to the Nine Domains was as difficult as climbing a mountain.

" Just the three of us will go in, you two return to the Nine Domains! " Lu Tian addressed Sun Kemin and Long Jie, finalizing the plan.

Long Jie and Sun Kemin nodded and flew toward the outside of the Chaos Abyss, leaving only Lu Tian, Jiang Sici, and Leng Qiuchan in the cave space.

" How did you get here? Where are Qianxue and Mengru? " Lu Tian looked at the two women. He had asked them to stay behind because he wanted to ask his questions.

" After we escaped from the Thunder Sea Marsh, we were transported here by a teleportation array. We've been staying in this cave space of the Primordial Lord's for a while. As for Qianxue and Mengru, we lost contact after the teleportation. " Jiang Sici spoke, recounting how the four of them had searched for Lu Tian.

At that time, when Lu Tian accidentally died, the four women were nearly desperate. If it weren't for an unknown sense, they might have already collapsed. They had found the Broken God Cliff and then went to the Thunder Sea Marsh, where they were transported here. They had been trapped here ever since.

Although the two women spoke briefly, Lu Tian knew how difficult their journey had been—far more challenging than he imagined.

" You've worked hard! " Lu Tian embraced Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan, his face returning to a gentle expression. Then he looked toward the depths of the Chaos Abyss.

" Let's go, try to reach deeper! " Lu Tian showed a cold expression and took a step toward the depths of the Chaos Abyss.

This time, no one guided Lu Tian, but with Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan accompanying him, his path was simpler. They had spent nearly a decade exploring the Chaos Abyss and wouldn't easily accept being trapped there.

" We did see terrifying light radiating from the depths of the Chaos Abyss before, never expecting it to be the legendary Magnetic Immortal Light! " Jiang Sici spoke as they walked, and Lu Tian also told them about the news of Luo Li and others being kidnapped.

" But collecting this light isn't easy at all! I feel its power is even superior to the Epoch Power. Without a special method, it's hard for us to collect! " Leng Qiuchan spoke, her voice filled with seriousness.

" No matter what, let's find it first! " Lu Tian sighed, naturally knowing the difficulty of collecting the Magnetic Immortal Light. Otherwise, Ming Huan wouldn't have sent him to collect it.

Time passed slowly as Lu Tian and the two women, accompanied by a small wolf, walked through the thick chaos mist. They had traveled for an entire day.

Although it was just one day, Lu Tian knew that with Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan's guidance, he had saved a lot of detours. Many places were filled with danger, clearly the result of their years of luck and life-or-death experiences.

" We're here! " Leng Qiuchan's voice interrupted Lu Tian's thoughts. A massive gray mountain stretched endlessly before his eyes.

" This is where we saw the Magnetic Immortal Light you mentioned! " Jiang Sici addressed Lu Tian, then gazed at the endless mountain top with a look of fear.

" Hum... " As Jiang Sici's words finished, a series of humming sounds suddenly echoed in the sky.

Then an overwhelming fluctuation appeared in their perception, a powerful pressure that made the three of them tremble. The small wolf beside them also shook in fear, its eyes filled with terror as it gazed at the mountain top shrouded in gray mist.

In an instant, a massive gray vortex appeared before Lu Tian and the others. At its center, lights flickered.

" It's confirmed! This Magnetic Immortal Light appears every half year. The last time it appeared was exactly six months ago! " Jiang Sici addressed Lu Tian.

In the gray vortex, a white beam of light suddenly descended, appearing before Lu Tian and the others. It illuminated the chaotic mountain top, briefly revealing its scene.

A gray altar stood on the mountain top, and the white beam of light shone upon it. Then something changed, and a powerful light was absorbed by the altar, transforming into flowing symbols that circled around it before disappearing into the altar.

" Gone? What is this altar, and why does it absorb the Magnetic Immortal Light? " Lu Tian felt a series of questions in his heart.

More importantly, who had set up this altar deep within the Chaos Abyss? It was clearly not the work of the Epoch Lord. Considering what the Epoch Lord had said before, that it was unsuitable for them to enter the depths, it was likely that there might be something terrifying in the deep Chaos Abyss.

" Let's go, let's see what's so special about this mountain! " Lu Tian addressed Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan, then smiled and stepped toward the massive staircase leading to the mountain top.

" Wait! Be careful! " Just as Lu Tian's foot hadn't touched the staircase, Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan's anxious voices echoed in his ears, causing Lu Tian to stop.

But one of his feet had already landed on the staircase. A wave of gray energy rose from under his foot, and suddenly, a thick gray lightning bolt shot down toward him.

The speed of the gray lightning was too fast, even Lu Tian couldn't react in time. He was struck on his head by the gray lightning, and a smell of burning filled his body.

Chapter 1451: Magnetic Mountain ()

The gray lightning instantly struck Lu Tian's body, causing a heart-wrenching pain that made his face change abruptly. The gray lightning directly affected his soul, and waves of lightning power roamed across his soul.

" What the hell is this! " Lu Tian couldn't help but speak, his voice filled with shock. Never expected to be struck by lightning the moment he stepped on the stairs.

" Fortunately, I've been struck by lightning before, otherwise I might have suffered serious injuries! " Lu Tian sighed softly and spoke to Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan.

" You two stay here, I'll go up alone! " Lu Tian's face showed a slight smile, acting as if it didn't matter.

" Be careful! This staircase has nine levels, each with a different danger. We two only reached the third level before coming down because the fourth level gave us a sense of danger, so we didn't go up! " Leng Qiuchan spoke with concern.

" Don't worry! " Lu Tian looked at the massive staircase, his eyes showing a slight smile. Although he felt it wasn't simple, Lu Tian had experienced many dangerous places and had rich experience.

He leapt into the air, transforming into a long rainbow that flew toward the second level of stairs and landed on it.

" One thousand zhang per step! " Lu Tian estimated the height of each step, forming a rough guess in his mind. Then he looked at the second level with deep thoughts.

" Hum... " A scorching heat instantly appeared in Lu Tian's perception, causing his eyebrows to slightly frown.

" Roar... " Next, a fire dragon instantly descended from the sky toward Lu Tian, its terrifying temperature causing Lu Tian to feel a sense of fear.

" Fire? " Lu Tian's face showed disdain. If it were anything else, he might have been cautious, but for fire, Lu Tian really had nothing to fear. Even if it was heavenly fire, it would be suppressed by Xiao Qi.

" Go! " Lu Tian's hands formed a seal, and a fire dragon of colorless energy instantly flew from his hands. Its overwhelming power caused even the surrounding chaos mist to catch fire, rushing toward the descending fire dragon and biting it. It seemed to want to swallow this fire dragon.

" Boom... " Fire splattered, and the overwhelming fire dragon was powerless against Xiao Qi's霸道 fire. It immediately turned into a vast sea of fire, spreading across the second level of stairs.

" Too simple! " Lu Tian smiled and then stepped onto the third level, his eyes filled with a slight tension because it was just one level away from the fourth level that had given Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan a sense of danger.

" Wu... " Wind sounds arose, an immense coldness instantly appearing in Lu Tian's perception. In a blink of an eye, the entire third level was frozen over, including Lu Tian himself, who turned into a block of ice.

" Crack... " After an hour, Lu Tian finally broke out of the ice, his face filled with a sense of shock. He looked at the remaining steps with a look of fear.

" What is this place? The essence of chaos is creation, but did this mountain create different dangers? It doesn't seem like it. This mountain's body is so solid, obviously not ordinary material! " Lu Tian didn't continue walking but crouched down, touching the gray mountain wall with his hand.

" Hum... " As Lu Tian's hand touched the mountain wall, his face suddenly changed.

A powerful suction instantly affected his entire body, making him feel as if his soul was about to be torn out. He couldn't resist at all.

" Get out! " Lu Tian roared, displaying a powerful soul aura that broke free from the restraint, leaving his face pale.
