After a flurry of commotion, the courtyard once again fell into silence. Luo Tian found a corner to sit in, extending his hand and producing an Evil-Dispelling Pill. He could sense the thick ghost energy within it.

"Is the ghost energy flowing?" Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing something unusual about the Evil-Dispelling Pill. He began studying the direction of the ghost energy's flow.

Ye Liangchen, meanwhile, had nothing to do. He wandered around the courtyard before re-entering Buxian City, aimlessly strolling about.

For the next few days, Luo Tian did not move a single step nor attempt to refine any elixirs. Instead, he continuously worked on perfecting the Evil-Dispelling Pills.

"Boom..." A explosion erupted from Luo Tian's hands, a thick mass of ghost energy hovering in his palm.

"Such a waste! That was an Evil-Dispelling Pill, worth one thousand battle merits!" People's mouths twitched as they watched Luo Tian crush the pill, cursing inwardly.

Luo Tian possessed six Evil-Dispelling Pills. He gave two to Ye Liangchen and two to Zhang Desheng, as Zhang had previously spoken in Luo Tian's favor. To Luo Tian, this was a debt of gratitude. Upon arriving at Buxian City, his foundation was still unstable, so he only gave Zhang Desheng two pills.

During these days, during the day, Qin Hewei and Ye Liangchen led their groups out of the city to hunt ghostly creatures. Their bodies bore a touch of malevolence.

Each time they returned and saw Luo Tian sitting idly, their eyes flashed with disdain.

"When I become a Squad Leader, I'll show this kid!" Ye Chen's eyes glowed with coldness. The others also gritted their teeth, though they had heard the change in attitude from the purple-robed Hundred-Commanders and Squad Leaders towards Luo Tian, they thought it was trivial. After all, these sect prodigies had influence behind them; they simply chose not to act.

Time passed slowly. A month had gone by, yet Luo Tian still pondered endlessly, occasionally refining elixirs but always failing.

"Ha! Get out of here!" A resounding thunderclap echoed as a blazing sun descended, pressing upon the body of a young man.

The sun shattered, and Bai Tian's figure appeared in people's sight. His eyes carried arrogance as he gazed at the bleeding youth before him.

"Bai Tian has been promoted to Squad Leader, and may recruit ten members. These ten belong to the Eighth Legion of Buxian City!" A authoritative voice echoed as the defeated youth never rose again.

Chapter 2016: Emergence

"Such speed! Someone has become a Squad Leader in just one month!" Everyone's faces bore astonishment as they gazed at Bai Tian standing proudly.

Behind Bai Tian stood seven people, their gazes filled with ferocity. Including Bai Tian, there had been ten initially. However, over the past month, Bai Tian had relentlessly hunted ghostly creatures outside the city—both with the main force and alone. Thus, two had been lost.

"Ten thousand battle merits in a month, and successfully promoted to Squad Leader. No one in the Eighth Legion has ever achieved such speed!" People marveled, noting how different Bai Tian was now compared to when he first arrived at Buxian City.

"Move aside!" Bai Tian kicked the defeated youth, then strode into a thatched hut. The White Sect disciples behind him followed.

"Roar..." Soon after Bai Tian entered the hut, a series of howls echoed in people's ears, reaching an agonizing pitch.

"Quickly go to the Alchemy Hall and fetch Evil-Dispelling Pills!" A shout rang out. Two White Sect disciples rushed out, heading toward the hall where Luo Tian had previously requested Evil-Dispelling Pills.

"It must be from all those months of hunting ghostly creatures outside the city. The ghost energy has accumulated too much!" People murmured, their eyes filled with admiration.

Luo Tian's eyes flickered with light. He took out his cauldron, then pointed his finger. Seven-colored flames erupted from his hand and soared into the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

"Everyone, run! Luo Tian's about to refine another elixir!" Seeing Luo Tian's actions, people felt the heat and quickly scattered.

"Is this kid crazy? He's still refining after over a month!" People whispered, then turned their gazes back to the hut where Bai Tian was.

"One month has passed. Still daydreaming? If refining Evil-Dispelling Pills were so easy, everyone would do it!" As Luo Tian refined again, Ye Chen and Qin Hewei entered the courtyard. Their faces bore a weathered look, with black energy swirling around them.

"Has Bai Tian become a Squad Leader?" Qin Hewei and others followed Ye Chen into the courtyard, hearing people's murmurs. Their faces bore a touch of resentment.

"I challenge the Squad Leader!" Ye Chen and Qin Hewei spoke simultaneously, drawing attention.

"Ah, these new recruits are really bold!" The veteran soldiers murmured with admiration.

Ye Chen and Qin Hewei exchanged glances before rushing toward a thatched hut where someone was inside.

"You two kids are really arrogant!" As they dashed out, two youths emerged from the huts. Their faces bore coldness as they rushed toward Ye Chen and Qin Hewei.

The sound of combat echoed again, drawing people's anticipation. If both Ye Chen and Qin Hewei succeeded in their challenges, along with Bai Tian, three Squad Leaders would be formed. It was unprecedented in the history of the Eighth Legion.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The sound of battle echoed, drawing people's eyes.

"Master, the Alchemy Hall won't issue Evil-Dispelling Pills. They say Squad Leaders must wait a month before receiving them!" As Ye Chen and Qin Hewei fought, the two White Sect disciples who had gone to exchange for pills returned in a hurry, their faces filled with anxiety.

"This is bad!" Upon hearing their words, the veteran soldiers' expressions turned pitiful. Ghost energy accumulated in the body over time was extremely harmful. These veterans had long stayed within Buxian City, avoiding going out to prevent excessive ghost energy accumulation.

"Battle merits are good, but one can't risk their life. The body is the foundation of revolution!" The veterans sighed, gazing at the huts.

"Who? I'm willing to trade a mid-grade immortal artifact for an Evil-Dispelling Pill!" Bai Tian shouted, his voice filled with madness.

"Damn it! Even becoming a Squad Leader doesn't allow exchanging for an Evil-Dispelling Pill!" Ye Chen and Qin Hewei, locked in combat with two Squad Leaders, felt a chill. They too had been hunting ghostly creatures outside the city for a month, accumulating some ghost energy. They hoped to obtain Evil-Dispelling Pills by becoming Squad Leaders to dispel the ghost energy.

But they hadn't expected it would take a month. Though they could wait, enduring the ghost energy's presence was unbearable for most.

"Mid-grade immortal artifact!" Upon hearing Bai Tian's shout, people were tempted. However, Evil-Dispelling Pills were too crucial; they had no extra ones. Each had their own plans and couldn't part with them.

"Ha! You kid, do you have residual ghost energy in your body? If we keep fighting, the ghost energy might burst out!" The Squad Leader facing Ye Chen sneered, having pushed him back. His voice carried a touch of relief.

Ye Chen and Qin Hewei were prodigies, so they could still suppress these two Squad Leaders in single combat.

"Can't fight anymore. If the accumulated ghost energy bursts, I'll need more time to suppress it. Let's exchange for Evil-Dispelling Pills with battle merits first!" Ye Chen and Qin Hewei spoke simultaneously, retreating.

"Ha! That's better. Wait until you accumulate more battle merits. Don't suffer like that poor guy did for the Squad Leader position. It's not worth it!" The two Squad Leaders smiled, then sighed deeply. They had decided to avoid the courtyard for the next month and take on tasks outside to hunt ghostly creatures.

Other Squad Leaders in the courtyard also had this thought. They hadn't expected these new recruits to accumulate ten thousand battle merits so quickly.

"Ah..." As Ye Chen and Qin Hewei stopped fighting, the hut echoed with more howls. The sound carried an agonizing pain, making everyone shiver.

"Two mid-grade immortal artifacts and ten middle-level martial arts seals of the Immortal Realm!" Bai Tian growled, sitting cross-legged in the hut. Black ghost energy swirled around him, his hair disheveled, sweat dripping from his forehead.

Bai Tian's offered price was highly tempting. However, the veterans wanted to exchange but dared not. If they did, they might end up like Bai Tian.

"Damn it! If you had delayed the explosion a bit, I would have gone out to earn battle merits and exchanged one Evil-Dispelling Pill for you!" The veterans regretted, their eyes filled with sorrow.

"Help!" Bai Tian howled continuously, in unbearable pain as if torn apart by thousands of ghosts.

"What kind of pain must he be in?" Ye Chen and Qin Hewei trembled, gazing at the hut that kept shaking.

All the geniuses of the Middle Heaven Region broke out in cold sweat, feeling fortunate they hadn't stepped outside Buxian City recklessly.

"Damn it! It's too dangerous. I won't go out at all, but damn it, there's less than a month left before we must hunt ghostly creatures outside Buxian City!" Ye Liangchen trembled, pondering whether to use the connections left by Ye Sheng to avoid leaving Buxian City.

"Buzz..." As people were shocked, waves of energy spread out. Nine seven-colored fire dragons coiled around the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

"Ah! I see now. The Evil-Dispelling Pill isn't made with ordinary alchemy techniques but requires the collision of the sun's yang and ghost energy's yin to condense!" Luo Tian murmured in his heart, his eyes glowing with light.

"Roar..." A black vortex swirled around the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron, continuously flowing into it.

"..." Everyone felt a moment of panic. They took a few steps back, fearing another explosion and being caught in the blast. After all, Luo Tian's previous explosion had left even the purple-robed Hundred-Commanders speechless.

A black ghost energy dragon coiled within the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron, roaring with a cold breath that frosted Luo Tian's hands.

"Fire, burn brighter!" Luo Tian commanded. His immortal energy surged toward the seven-colored flames, causing them to flare again.

"Let it collide..." Luo Tian growled, directing the nine fire dragons toward the black dragon.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds rose in the courtyard. Invisible waves spread from the massive Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

"Another explosion!" People shouted, gazing at Luo Tian's direction. They felt this blast was even more intense than before.

"Let it solidify..." Luo Tian's eyes were bloodshot. He hadn't rested for a month, constantly studying the flow of ghost energy in the Evil-Dispelling Pills.

His vast spiritual awareness surged into the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron, sorting out the chaotic ghost energy after its collision with fire.

"It... didn't explode?" Everyone was bewildered. Though the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron roared continuously, it didn't burst out. However, people could sense a powerful aura brewing within.

"It's impossible to create such an item; he insists on trying, wasting time!" Ye Chen and Qin Hewei wore mocking expressions. Though they didn't understand alchemy, they knew that such sounds meant an explosion.

"Ah..." In contrast to the others, Bai Tian inside the hut had crimson eyes filled with shock. His body instinctively craved to devour what was in Luo Tian's cauldron, alleviating his pain.

"Ugh..." As people scoffed, waves of energy spread from the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

"Haha! Come out!" Luo Tian laughed, then slapped his hand. The golden lid lifted, and black mist spewed from the cauldron, causing everyone to gasp.

"Buzz..." A black pill emerged from the mist, hovering in people's sight.

"My!" Bai Tian rushed out of the hut with disheveled hair, instinctively rushing toward the black pill.

Chapter 2017: Bai Tian's Friend

The black pill rose, causing people to gape in shock. They stared at the black pill, surprised that Luo Tian had truly succeeded.

"The scent of an Evil-Dispelling Pill! And it's still fresh!" The Hundred-Commanders and even the Thousand-Commanders in the inner courtyard were stunned. They stepped out of their courtyards, heading toward the outer one.

"My!" Bai Tian's body became a blur as he rushed toward the black pill, reaching out to grab it. At this moment, Bai Tian's eyes only saw the Evil-Dispelling Pill.

"Move aside..." Luo Tian wouldn't let his painstakingly refined Evil-Dispelling Pill be taken by Bai Tian. He sneered, then stomped the ground, causing a thunderous sound as he became a golden blur and reached the pill, grabbing it in his hand.

"Boom..." On the other side, Luo Tian swung his hand and slapped Bai Tian, colliding with Bai Tian's hand reaching for the Evil-Dispelling Pill.

The collision of their hands sent both of them landing on the ground. Bai Tian's body kept retreating, leaving deep footprints in the earth. In contrast, Luo Tian stood like a stone statue.

Their confrontation made Bai Tian清醒 slightly, but his eyes still burned with madness. He stared at Luo Tian: "Give it to me!"

"Don't give it! My things, why should I give them to you!" Luo Tian sneered, his eyes filled with disdain. He didn't owe Bai Tian anything. His hard work had created this Evil-Dispelling Pill, and he didn't want to give it away cheaply.

"Then I'll take it!" Bai Tian roared, rushing toward Luo Tian again. At this point, he was on the verge of collapse. The ghost energy burst out, making him lose his mind and only wanting to seize the Evil-Dispelling Pill.

"Roar..." Bai Tian growled, like a fierce beast, rushing toward Luo Tian with a punch.

"Bringing it on yourself!" Luo Tian sneered and leapt into the air, slapping his hand. They clashed again.

Bai Tian was also a prodigy, with strong physical strength. Though he wasn't as powerful as Luo Tian, Luo Tian couldn't defeat him quickly.

The thunderous sounds continued. The two fought in people's sight, and no one expected their first battle to be like this.

"Ah..." Bai Tian howled continuously, each punch he threw sending gusts of wind. They collided with Luo Tian's punches.

"Is he fighting to relieve the pain from the ghost energy?" Luo Tian quickly noticed Bai Tian's eyes had cleared slightly, his gaze deep.

"Really think I'm a soft target!" Luo Tian sneered in his heart. He kicked the ground, instantly appearing before Bai Tian, his speed more than twice as fast.

"Boom..." A golden fist became a blur, pressing down toward Bai Tian.

Bai Tian's eyes had just regained clarity when he was surprised by Luo Tian's sudden burst. He raised his arms.

"Crack..." The golden fist smashed onto Bai Tian's arms, the sound of cracking like thunder in people's ears.

Bai Tian's body became a meteor falling from the sky, crashing into the ground. His arms were completely broken, and he fell onto the ground, spitting blood. His clear eyes showed disbelief.

"Bai Tian has lost. In terms of physical strength, this Luo Tian is truly invincible!" Ye Chen and others stared with heavy eyes at Luo Tian.

"Boom..." As Bai Tian tried to get up, Luo Tian's body appeared out of nowhere. His foot landed heavily on Bai Tian's back, making Bai Tian howl continuously.

"What are you? You dare to steal from me? I'm the one who steals!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, gazing at Ye Chen and others.

This time, Luo Tian didn't choose to endure. Since he could refine the Evil-Dispelling Pill, his status in Buxian City would inevitably change. Seeing the Hundred-Commanders and Thousand-Commanders who had already emerged was proof of that.

Moreover, Luo Tian had thought of a way to mass-produce the Evil-Dispelling Pills. Though it wasn't fully mature, if this plan succeeded, battle merits would be just numbers for Luo Tian.

Seeing Luo Tian standing proudly, Ye Chen and Qin Hewei's faces slightly changed. They had previously mocked Luo Tian for not being able to refine the Evil-Dispelling Pill. Now, he had succeeded and even defeated Bai Tian. This was a clear slap in the face, making them feel burning embarrassment.

Bai Tian's strength was similar to theirs. If Luo Tian had defeated Bai Tian, he could also defeat them.

"However, if you add more to your exchange condition, I might consider exchanging this Evil-Dispelling Pill for you!" Luo Tian's face wore a playful expression. The condition Bai Tian had proposed was indeed tempting.

"100 middle-level martial arts seals of the Immortal Realm and five mid-grade immortal artifacts!" Bai Tian gritted his teeth, speaking with pain. His regret was deep.

"You damn fool! If you had said it earlier, I wouldn't have needed to steal. I lost face and my things!" Bai Tian's mouth kept spitting blood, unsure if it was from anger or injury.

"Exchange!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. He took the storage bag from Bai Tian's hand and flicked his finger, sending a black streak into Bai Tian's mouth.

"Gulping..." Bai Tian didn't hesitate. His throat moved, swallowing the black Evil-Dispelling Pill.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed within Bai Tian's body. He immediately sat cross-legged in people's sight.

"Roar..." A howl echoed, as if thousands of ghosts roared within Bai Tian's body. Black mist enveloped him.

"It's safe!" People watched the now calm Bai Tian. His calmness indicated that Luo Tian's elixir was harmless.

"Luo Tian, do you have any interest in joining my team? I guarantee that all one hundred of my soldiers will fully protect your safety!" A big man stepped forward, smiling. This man was a Hundred-Commander.

"A mere Hundred-Commander dares to ask Luo Tian to join!" The big man's words hadn't finished when a cold sneer echoed. A purple figure stepped out, revealing a Thousand-Commander.

A disciple capable of refining Evil-Dispelling Pills was too important. If they could get Luo Tian to join their team, the value would be immeasurable.

After all, Evil-Dispelling Pills were priceless. Each exchange required five thousand battle merits. If these five thousand battle merits were exchanged for treasures and elixirs, their means of survival on the battlefield would multiply.

"Everyone, let's discuss this later. However, I can promise that in the future, I can exchange Evil-Dispelling Pills for you. Eight thousand battle merits per pill, and the effect is definitely worth it!" Luo Tian smiled slightly.

"Luo Tian, your words are too arrogant. Evil-Dispelling Pills are good, but you're charging too much. Besides, they can't be mass-produced; otherwise, they wouldn't be so rare!" Someone spoke, though their voice was polite, everyone could sense the disdain in it.

"Boom..." As those words just finished, a resounding thunderclap echoed. Bai Tian, who had been sitting cross-legged, suddenly stood up and opened his eyes. Black ghost energy flickered in Bai Tian's eyes.

Bai Tian opened his mouth and sucked, causing the world to tremble. Black ghost energy instantly formed a massive vortex, being sucked into Bai Tian's body.

"Buzz..." Clouds rose. Buxian City turned into night, with thunder roaming in the darkness, making everyone's faces show shock.

"True Immortal's Trial!" Someone exclaimed, gazing at the swirling thunder. Their eyes showed fear.

The black sky tore open. The Eighth Legion Commander who had once received Luo Tian and a thousand prodigies stepped out of the void. He grabbed Bai Tian, taking him away.

"Boom..." As the Legion Commander took Bai Tian away, a furious roar echoed outside Buxian City. Thunder illuminated the night.

"How could it be so fast!"

"It's because of that Evil-Dispelling Pill. Ordinary Evil-Dispelling Pills expel ghost energy from the body, but Bai Tian absorbed it instead, converting it into cultivation and entering the True Immortal realm!" People quickly understood why Bai Tian was like this.

"So, Bai Tian's entry into the True Immortal realm has a big contribution from Luo Tian. This is what he meant by 'worth it,' and why his Evil-Dispelling Pills are more expensive than the Alchemy Hall's!" People exclaimed, their gazes toward Luo Tian changed.

"Rebellious! Luo Tian's elixir artistry is truly rebellious!"

"Within a month, he not only refined the Evil-Dispelling Pill but also improved it significantly!" People's eyes showed admiration.

"Boom..." Thunder continued, lightning falling outside Buxian City. Ghostly creatures were annihilated by the thunder. Bai Tian, bathed in lightning, continuously fought against the True Immortal's trial.

As a prodigy, Bai Tian's True Immortal Trial was much stronger than ordinary people. However, Bai Tian was also rebellious. After an hour, he finally passed the True Immortal Trial and was taken back by the Legion Commander.

"You, come with me!" The Legion Commander's face bore solemnity. He grabbed Luo Tian and vanished from people's sight.

"Ah..." Bai Tian took a long breath, watching the Legion Commander and Luo Tian disappear. His eyes showed respect.

Bai Tian's wrist, after passing the True Immortal Trial, had gained nearly two hundred thousand battle merits. All of these were from the ghosts Bai Tian had killed during his trial.

"From today on, Luo Tian is my friend!" Bai Tian spoke and stepped into the hut.

"Wow..." The crowd murmured, gazing at Bai Tian entering the hut. They hadn't expected such a big change in Bai Tian's attitude.

"Bai Tian is backed by the top sect of the Middle Heaven Region, the One Sky Sect!" Ye Chen's eyes showed contemplation.

Chapter 2018: Why Me?

In the central position of the military camp courtyard stood a magnificent palace, symbolizing the highest position in the Eighth Legion. It was the residence of the Legion Commander.

Around this magnificent palace, nine palaces surrounded it like stars circling a pearl. These nine palaces were the residences of the Nine Hundred-Commanders of the Eighth Legion.

"Nine Dragons Circling a Pearl!" Luo Tian stood in the central palace, his face filled with strong shock. He felt the terrain of this palace was indeed "Nine Dragons Circling a Pearl."

"Kid, you've seen quite a bit. You even know about 'Nine Dragons Circling a Pearl'!" The Legion Commander smiled, grabbing a wine glass from the table.

"Eighth Legion Commander Ke Duanshan, Half-step Immortal King. One of the strongest in Buxian City!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, thinking about the middle-aged man before him.

A Half-step Immortal King. If placed in a sect of the Middle Heaven Region, he would be a sect leader or even an elder. However, in Buxian City, he was merely a Legion Commander. Though he was still a powerful figure, compared to the carefree sect leaders, he was much weaker.

Above the Legion Commander were city lords. Luo Tian couldn't help but marvel at Buxian City's strength, which definitely surpassed any sect he had seen before.

" How did you do it?" Ke Duanshan smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. He had developed some interest in Luo Tian but only curiosity. If it were just about refining an Evil-Dispelling Pill, Luo Tian wasn't enough to gain his attention. The reason he brought Luo Tian here was just a favor, a casual question about how he managed to turn ghost energy into cultivation.

"Commander Ke, I just guessed. The result isn't fully mature yet!" Luo Tian spoke softly and didn't reveal his method. Although this method was only known to himself, he wouldn't give it away without benefit.

"Kid, don't be tricky. One million battle merits, tell me the method!" Ke Duanshan smiled again, raising a cup of wine and gazing at Luo Tian.

"My friend once taught me a technique that could convert ghost energy into immortal energy. So I had the idea to apply it to this elixir refinement!" Luo Tian spoke.

"Good!" Ke Duanshan nodded, then pointed his finger. One million battle merits instantly appeared on Luo Tian's wrist ring.

He knew Luo Tian was hiding something, but he wasn't upset. Ke Duanshan was one of the strongest in Buxian City.

Moreover, Luo Tian had indeed contributed to Buxian City. However, this contribution wasn't significant in Ke Duanshan's view. Luo Tian's Evil-Dispelling Pills were much more effective than those of other alchemists, but they couldn't be mass-produced. If they could be mass-produced, Buxian City's overall strength would definitely rise a level.

"Go down!" Ke Duanshan waved his hand. Luo Tian's figure vanished from the palace and reappeared in the courtyard.

"One million battle merits!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered with a smile. One million battle merits was an unimaginable number for the previous Luo Tian. Even if he hunted ghosts for a year, it might take him to accumulate one million battle merits. But now with the Evil-Dispelling Pills, Luo Tian was confident he could achieve one million battle merits in a month.

"Big Brother!" Ye Liangchen saw Luo Tian and sighed deeply, then his face was filled with excitement.

"Big Brother, what do we do next?" Ye Liangchen asked. Since Luo Tian could refine Evil-Dispelling Pills, it meant they would live comfortably for the next month.

"Refine two more Evil-Dispelling Pills and find a place to stay!" Luo Tian waved his hand, causing the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron to roar again.

"Is Luo Tian about to refine another elixir? How long has it been since he last did?" Seeing Luo Tian's actions, people's faces changed again. Unconsciously, their称呼 of Luo Tian had changed.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian pointed his finger. The Ghost-Controlling Seal in his body emitted waves, rushing into the cauldron.

"Ah..." As a bit of the Ghost-Controlling Seal's power rushed into the cauldron, the ghost energy in the world surged again, rushing toward the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

"Maybe for others, it's hard to refine Evil-Dispelling Pills quickly. It's because other people's spiritual awareness can only absorb the ghost energy in the world once. But I can use the Ghost-Controlling Seal's power to absorb ghost energy!" Luo Tian murmured in his heart. Then, his immortal energy surged again, and the seven-colored flames roared once more, colliding with the ghost energy in the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

"Again! It was like this before!" People's faces bore shock. The Hundred-Commanders' eyes showed eagerness, even the Thousand-Commanders had excitement.

"This Luo Tian must be recruited into my team!" The Thousand-Commanders thought, then gazed at other Thousand-Commanders with hostility.

"Boom... Boom..." After the familiar thunderclaps, a black elixir appeared in people's sight.

"It really worked!" People gasped. They looked at Luo Tian as if he were a god. It was the first time they had seen someone successfully refine two Evil-Dispelling Pills.

"Coincidence, it must be coincidence!" Ye Chen and Qin Hewei spoke in disbelief. They couldn't believe Luo Tian was so rebellious.

"Buzz..." However, as their words finished, black ghost energy descended again from the sky, rushing into the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

"What is he doing?" Everyone's hearts tightened. They gazed at Luo Tian, who hadn't moved.

"Third refinement! He's going to refine the third Evil-Dispelling Pill!" People didn't know what to say. Even the Thousand-Commanders were stunned.

In the Hundred-Commanders' palaces, Luo Tian's elixir refinement also caught the attention of several Hundred-Commanders. However, they only showed curiosity for a moment before closing their eyes again.

"This Luo Tian should be recruited. If we can recruit him, great; if not, don't make enemies!" They spoke calmly.

As they spoke, more Thousand-Commanders came out of the inner courtyard. Their eyes gazed at Luo Tian refining his third batch of Evil-Dispelling Pills.

"Is that Chen Long, the Hundred-Commander's subordinate Thousand-Commander? Why is he here? Is the Hundred-Commander also trying to recruit Luo Tian?" As those Thousand-Commanders under the Hundred-Commanders appeared, the outer courtyard became chaotic.

In a large hall, three men sat. The leader was a middle-aged man, with two youths sitting beside him.

"Senior Brother, should we go see this kid?" A strong youth spoke to the middle-aged man.

"No need. Let this kid grow on his own!" The middle-aged man sighed deeply. This middle-aged man was the one who had previously stopped those from Bai Shuize for Luo Tian. If Luo Tian saw these three, he would be overjoyed.

"This person is mine!" The middle-aged man spoke softly. His voice echoed in the nine palaces of the inner courtyard. The Hundred-Commanders who had sent their subordinates to recruit Luo Tian were momentarily stunned but shook their heads and recalled their subordinates.

"Ah..." Seeing the Thousand-Commanders leave, those who hadn't allied with Hundred-Commanders sighed deeply.

"Boom..." As the final thunderclap echoed, a third Evil-Dispelling Pill appeared in people's sight. Everyone stopped breathing.

"He really did it!" No one expected Luo Tian to refine three Evil-Dispelling Pills in a row. It was beyond people's imagination.

With the third Evil-Dispelling Pill refined, Luo Tian's face turned pale. Although ghost energy wasn't a problem, maintaining the seven-colored flames and the spiritual awareness required for condensing the elixir was massive. If it weren't for his immortal energy and spiritual awareness comparable to an early-stage True Immortal, he wouldn't have refined three Evil-Dispelling Pills in a row.

Ye Chen and Qin Hewei closed their mouths. If they could say it was luck for the second one, then for the third, they would be fools.

"Two Evil-Dispelling Pills for fifteen thousand battle merits. Anyone want to exchange?" Luo Tian spoke to the crowd.

"This..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the veteran soldiers were tempted. They had seen the effect of Luo Tian's Evil-Dispelling Pills with their own eyes, but they currently had no battle merits.

"Twenty thousand battle merits. I'll exchange!" As no one spoke, Bai Tian stepped out of the thatched hut and waved his hand. A streak of light rushed into Luo Tian's wrist, causing a golden glow to appear on his wrist. The glow was yellow.

"Yellow! One million..." Seeing the faint yellow light, people gasped again. Ten thousand battle merits showed as blue, one million as yellow, and ten million as purple—each color corresponding to different positions. These people knew this.

"Where did he get one million battle merits?"

"It must be the Legion Commander gave it to him!" People quickly thought of Ke Duanshan taking Luo Tian away and returning with one million battle merits.

"The previous grudge is erased. From today on, you are my friend, Bai Tian. I owe you a favor!" Bai Tian spoke softly. He had been stuck at the half-step True Immortal for some time, but with an opportunity, he had broken through.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded. Bai Tian was backed by the One Sky Sect, and it was willing to befriend him.

"Battle merits are enough. Now, I need to find a place to stay!" Luo Tian murmured quietly, gazing at the thatched huts.

Upon being seen by Luo Tian, each Squad Leader's face changed. They dared not speak.

"I challenge the Squad Leader!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, and a beam of light descended from the sky. The light landed on a Squad Leader, who had ten thousand battle merits subtracted from his wrist.

"Damn it! Why me!" A big man's face bore bitterness. He looked at his wrist with ten thousand battle merits added, gazing at Luo Tian with a mournful expression. This was Zhang Desheng, who had previously spoken in Luo Tian's favor.

"Uh..." Seeing Zhang Desheng step out, Luo Tian was slightly stunned. He hadn't expected it to be so precise; Zhang Desheng had been chosen.

Chapter 2019: Directly a Thousand-Commander

"Alas, I surrender!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly. Since Zhang Desheng had spoken in his favor before, Luo Tian wouldn't trouble him.

"Thank you!" Zhang Desheng nodded, his eyes filled with gratitude. Luo Tian's immediate surrender meant he had gained ten thousand battle merits without effort, a significant sum for Zhang Desheng.

"I challenge the Squad Leader!" Luo Tian could only speak again. A green light descended, landing on a Squad Leader. This Squad Leader was the one previously challenged by Ye Chen.
