"Ugh..." Luotian let out a long sigh, as Nan Gong Yuqing and the others left the vast battlefield. The people from Tianyuan Sect and the Merfolk Clan were now in a disadvantage, although they had more numbers. Only a few of them were at the half-Immortal King level.

There was nothing else they could do, but it was good that the Immortal Kings' battle had given them an advantage. Once Shui Changkong and Shui Li defeated one, they would be able to completely suppress Tiancang Sect.

"Is the time coming?" Luotian looked at the sunset, which seemed to be stained with blood, shining upon the Huan Tian Sea. His eyes showed anticipation, feeling his strength constantly recovering.

"Are you not coming out? Do you really want the Immortal Lord to be angry?" Qian Huaiyuan was covered in wounds, and he was on the verge of collapse. His voice was loud and resolute.

Qian Huaiyuan's heart was bleeding; this battle had greatly weakened Tiancang Valley, with heavy casualties. Even the Sect Master Qian Tianming was dead.

But Qian Huaiyuan had no choice but to fight, for it was the will of Heaven and also the command of the Eternal Immortal King. If Qian Huaiyuan disobeyed, he would be mercilessly suppressed.

Originally, Qian Huaiyuan thought that their ambush on Tianyuan Sect and the location chosen in Huan Tian Sea was foolproof. But he hadn't expected that Tianyuan Sect was so strong, and had underestimated their network of connections, even within the forces in Huan Tian Sea.

"Have a secret plan?" Upon hearing Qian Huaiyuan's words, Luotian's eyes immediately narrowed, and his heart skipped a beat.

"Haha, Master Qian, you've worked hard. Leave the rest to us!" As soon as Qian Huaiyuan's words finished, four powerful auras burst forth from the crowd of Tiancang Valley. There were four in total, and one was even at the middle stage of Immortal King.

"Luotian, do you remember us? In Xinyue Realm, you chased us pretty hard!" A strongman at the early stage of Immortal King shouted.

"Hongchen Sect, Meng Hongchen!" Huo Zhu exclaimed as he looked at the leader of the middle-stage Immortal King.

"Hongchen Sect, ranked fifth among the major sects in Zhongtian, and also a branch of the Eternal Mountain!" Luotian immediately recalled the identity of that middle-stage Immortal King elder.

The other three strongmen at the early stage of Immortal King were from other sects, and Luotian had seen them before in Xinyue Realm.

"I can't hold on anymore, Meng Hongchen. Come over and join me to kill this fish!" Qian Huaiyuan shouted, being pushed back again by Shui Changkong.

These four had been hidden within the crowd of Tiancang Valley, arranged by the Eternal Immortal King in case something unexpected happened. Qian Huaiyuan was powerful, but he had no authority to command these four. He secretly resented them for not coming to his aid and letting Tiancang Valley weaken.

"No... our target is him!" Meng Hongchen shook his head gently, looking at Luotian sitting under the sky.

"Me?" Luotian was stunned, and he and Meng Wushuang both retreated. Boom...

The location they were in exploded, making Luotian's face dark.

The sky was getting darker. Luotian and Huo Zhu were about to recover their strength, but they hadn't expected four strongmen to suddenly appear.

"I'll take on Meng Hongchen. The rest are yours..." Meng Wushuang's face was also dark, and he spoke to Luotian. This was his limit.

"Stay strong! Just stay for half an hour, and I'll be fully recovered at the early stage of Immortal King. Plus, my Heavenly Demon Body Release hasn't been lifted yet. I can fight against a middle-stage Immortal King!"

"But how can we hold on?" Luotian muttered to himself, his eyes showing bitterness. Meng Wushuang had already rushed toward Meng Hongchen.

"Hey kid, you chased us pretty hard in Xinyue Realm!" A middle-aged man spoke, holding a golden long sword and slashing toward Luotian.

Luotian could only take out Longyuan Sword, and slashed a sword beam. At the same time, his body vanished from the spot.

"Buzz..." Luotian appeared a hundred feet away. However, a sword beam was already at his position.

"Crash..." Luotian held Longyuan Sword in front of him, colliding with the sword beam and being pushed back by a powerful impact.

At the same time, a big man with a long staff hit Luotian's back, making him spit blood.

"Damn it!" Luotian cursed in his heart. However, he held the sword with both hands and continuously defended against the three attackers' assaults. Occasionally, he would spit out some old blood, and his injuries, which had just started to recover, worsened again.

"Crush them with the Supplemental Stone!" Luotian shouted and activated the Zhao Tian Pagoda again. In this situation, he would be reduced to nothing in less than an hour.

"Y-You..." The Supplemental Stone's impatient voice echoed, but it didn't argue with Luotian. Instead, it rose high and pressed down on one of the early-stage Immortal Kings.

However, this time it was the Supplemental Stone itself that activated without being absorbed by Luotian's cultivation. Its power was much weaker than before.

Seeing the red small pagoda, the three early-stage Immortal Kings' faces changed. They clearly remembered that Qian Tianming had been killed with just a single explosion of blood mist.

Chapter 2407: Joining the Tianyuan Sect

" I'll fight with you!" The Supplemental Stone's unique voice echoed. The red small pagoda again erupted, pressing down on the three early-stage Immortal Kings.

"Unite to block it!" The three men's minds were shocked. They saw the pagoda, which wasn't controlled by Luotian but still had a mighty aura.

The Supplemental Stone had absorbed the relics from the Zhao Tian Pagoda, and its strength had increased significantly. Before absorbing the relics, the Supplemental Stone was already extremely strong. After absorbing a bit of world power, it had become even stronger.

Buzz... Buzz...

Three buzzes. The three early-stage Immortal Kings combined their barriers, forming a tri-color barrier with flowing laws and shaking the world.

"Crack..." In an instant, the red Zhao Tian Pagoda collided with the tri-color barrier. A deafening sound echoed, and the entire battlefield paused.

In view, the tri-color barrier shattered. The powerful impact made the three early-stage Immortal Kings spit blood.

However, this time the Zhao Tian Pagoda was not as strong. It was pushed back by a powerful impact, and the divine light dimmed significantly.

"Painful old man!" However, the Supplemental Stone was still lively and shouted. That red stone almost flew off the Zhao Tian Pagoda due to the impact.

"Still alive..." The three early-stage Immortal Kings' faces were pale. They looked at the Zhao Tian Pagoda flying away. That attack had injured them, but it wasn't fatal.

"Hit again!" Luotian roared, looking at the Zhao Tian Pagoda flying away. At this moment, there was nothing else he could do but to hold on temporarily.

"Master, hit again. I really am going to die. Can you let me rest for a while?" The Supplemental Stone's voice filled with sorrow echoed in Luotian's mind.

"..." Luotian was speechless. He didn't know how much more combat power the Supplemental Stone could unleash, but its voice was very weak. This made Luotian feel compassion.

"Better to rely on oneself than others!" Luotian muttered to himself. He opened a gray domain and held Longyuan Sword and Mo Ming Sword with both hands, rushing toward the three of them.

"Boom..." Just as Luotian was about to move, a heavy explosion echoed in the sky. A figure fell down into Huan Tian Sea.

"Shi..." Smoke spread, making Luotian's face change drastically.

"Kid, come with us. Someone wants to see you!" Meng Hongchen smiled on the sky, looking at Luotian. The figure that fell was Huo Zhu's Master Meng Wushuang.

Meng Wushuang, after continuous battles, had weakened. He was no match for Meng Hongchen in good condition and could only endure.

"Master!" Luotian flew up, rushing toward Huan Tian Sea. He plunged into it with a splash and brought out the weak Huo Zhu.

"Supplemental Stone, take Master Meng in!" Luotian spoke to the Supplemental Stone and looked at Meng Hongchen and the three early-stage Immortal Kings.

"Unfortunately, we were just one step away from recovery!" Luotian muttered to himself. At the same time, he observed other battlefields.

At Shui Changkong's place, although he was strong, Qian Huaiyuan wasn't eating vegetables. He had been struggling to hold on.

At Qin Chuan's place, he was being beaten by Nan Gong Yuqing and others. However, it would take some time to resolve. Shui Li was the same; Qin He Feng was unusually tenacious.

"Kid, come with us. Maybe you'll suffer less!" Meng Hongchen spoke. The Eternal Immortal King's intention was to capture alive if possible, so he could only try to get Luotian to follow him. If it didn't work, they would have to take his corpse.

"Epoch Book!" Luotian's eyes showed cruelty. The enemy was too strong, and even if he used One Sword to Defy the Immortals, it could only kill two early-stage Immortal Kings. Therefore, Luotian decided to directly use the Epoch Book.

He hadn't used it for a long time. Previously, with his cultivation level, he could only open one page. But now that he was at the early stage of Immortal King, he could activate three pages of the Epoch Book. He didn't know what power three pages would bring, but he was certain it would be extremely strong—destructive and world-shattering.

"Buzz..." Golden light spread from Luotian's body, and a powerful pressure surged out. Meng Hongchen and the others' faces slightly changed.

"This aura?" Meng Hongchen spoke, sensing a threat from Luotian. He had lived for so long and had never felt such a threat from an early-stage Immortal King before.

"Then I'll have to take your corpse!" Meng Hongchen muttered, his hands forming a gesture. The world trembled as powerful waves spread from his hands.

"Who dares to touch my elder brother, I'll kill you!" At this moment, a thunderous voice echoed. The loud voice even overshadowed the battle cries, making Luotian and others pause slightly.

"Master Meng, it's too much for you to attack a junior like this!" At the same time, an old voice echoed.

"Buzz..." A green hammer spun and flew from afar toward Meng Hongchen.

"This..." Meng Hongchen's face slightly changed. Seeing the big hammer, he didn't think twice and redirected his red palm toward it.

The collision sound immediately echoed. A deafening explosion sounded above Meng Hongchen's head, and the red palm was directly smashed to pieces. The green hammer also flew back.

"Crash..." Chains attached to the hammer's tail instantly straightened, forming a long dragon that returned to the hands of a strong old man.

"Master!" A black tower-like figure appeared in front of Luotian. Seeing Luotian covered in blood, his copper bell-like eyes turned red.

"Who!" A roar echoed. Chen Zhanbiao, like a fierce beast, roared and looked at Meng Hongchen and the four of them. His massive body didn't hesitate, rushing toward them like a madman.

"Lu Chong! Are you also going to get involved in this mess?" Meng Hongchen looked at Lu Chong but didn't pay attention to the rushing Chen Zhanbiao.

"There's no choice. My disciple's matter is my matter!" Lu Chong smiled but his eyes were serious. Meng Hongchen was a veteran strongman from Zhongtian, and Lu Chong wouldn't be careless.

"You've only recently reached the middle stage of Immortal King. You can't hold me!" Meng Hongchen laughed, emitting a terrifying aura and staring at Lu Chong.

For Lu Chong, Meng Hongchen wasn't careless. Lu Chong's strength and his chaotic robe made even him feel difficult to face. He had felt that Lu Chong's strength was no less than his own in the brief confrontation.

"Enough talk. I'll protect this kid!" Lu Chong shook his arms and looked at Meng Hongchen.

"Did you dare to get involved in the Battle of Striving for Heaven? Are you afraid of being punished by the Nine Immortal Mountains?" Meng Hongchen laughed and directly brought up the Nine Immortal Mountains.

"You also got involved, didn't you?" Lu Chong paused upon hearing Meng Hongchen's words.

The Battle of Striving for Heaven was a battle between two sects. Others or sects were not allowed to get involved, which had been a tradition since ancient times.

"Haha! We four joined Tiancang Sect three months ago. Now we are part of Tiancang Sect!" Meng Hongchen laughed, his eyes filled with pride.

"Aha! I see. Where is the Sect Master of Tianyuan Sect? Old man, I want to lead my disciples and join Tianyuan Sect. Please approve it!" Lu Chong loudly spoke, making Luotian's face show joy.

"Master, Master! I agree. These are your identity tokens!" Cao Dedu kicked Qin Chuan's butt and waved his hand, sending a block of tokens toward Lu Chong.

"Now I am also part of Tianyuan Sect!" Lu Chong sighed longingly. He hadn't expected to spend the rest of his life for his disciple, giving up his freedom.

As for whether the Nine Immortal Mountains would be angry, Lu Chong didn't care. He had a life-or-death friendship with Jiang Yuanxiong of the Supplemental Mountain.

"Roar..." As Lu Chong was sighing, Chen Zhanbiao appeared in front of an early-stage Immortal King's strongman. He had unknowingly acquired a red hammer and smashed it toward the strongman.

"Half-Immortal King dares to fight me!" The early-stage Immortal King's face showed contempt. He opened a domain and directly slapped toward Chen Zhanbiao.

"Boom..." However, when Chen Zhanbiao's hammer fell, the early-stage Immortal King's face immediately changed.

"Crack..." A crackling sound echoed. The early-stage Immortal King's domain was directly smashed by Chen Zhanbiao's hammer and collided with his palm.

The explosion shook, and Chen Zhanbiao's massive body was pushed back. What shocked people was that the early-stage Immortal King's entire arm was smashed by Chen Zhanbiao's hammer, turning into a mist of blood.

"This..." The other two early-stage Immortal Kings' faces changed. They hadn't expected a half-Immortal King to injure an early-stage Immortal King.

"Zhanbiao..." Luotian's face also showed amazement, looking at the retreating Chen Zhanbiao. He hadn't expected Chen Zhanbiao to have grown so much.

"Nine times!" Luotian inhaled sharply. Others didn't know, but he clearly felt that Chen Zhanbiao had unleashed nine times his physical strength in an instant.

"Kid, you're going to die!" The early-stage Immortal King's face showed a grimace. He had indeed been careless.

"Who dares to hurt my younger brother!"

"Who dares to harm my husband!" Meng Xue shouted, dancing her sword and rushing toward the early-stage Immortal King with two of her brothers.

On the other side, Lu Chong and Meng Hongchen were also fighting each other with continuous explosions.

"Only two left!" Luotian looked at the remaining two early-stage Immortal Kings, flew up and waved his hand. A black light flashed, instantly disappearing in front of Luotian—this was the poison needle.

Chapter 2408: Recovery

Black lights flashed, and more than ninety black lights instantly disappeared. Luotian was secretly praying that at least two or three would hit.

However, the next moment, Luotian was disappointed. His perception showed that only one poison needle had hit, leaving him speechless.

"Ah..." A pitiful scream echoed. One of the early-stage Immortal Kings had a twisted face and was in unbearable pain.

"What's going on?" Luotian was confused. He knew the poison needle's power; three of them could severely injure an Immortal King.

"Ah..." However, Luotian immediately inhaled sharply and understood what was happening.

"This is also possible!" Luotian couldn't help but speak, looking at the early-stage Immortal King who was holding his two legs and felt a chill in his lower body.

"I'll kill you!" The strongman screamed painfully, his voice as pitiful as it could be.

"Kill..." Luotian didn't hesitate. He waved his hands and unleashed the Hellish Ghost Claws, attacking the other early-stage Immortal King who was still staring blankly.

Black mist appeared instantly. A beast roared, and black claws rushed toward the early-stage Immortal King.

"Damned!" The middle-aged man's face was dark. He saw his companion in unbearable pain and knew he wouldn't have much combat power for a while. That place was the most vulnerable part of men.

"Buzz..." The sword buzzed, and a terrifying sword beam was shot from the early-stage Immortal King's hand toward the black ghost claws.

"Boom..." The collision sound echoed. The black ghost claws shattered, and the mist disappeared. The roaring beast was nowhere to be found.

Luotian flew up and attacked the early-stage Immortal King. He wanted to kill this strongman before he recovered from his injury.

The humming echoed, and Longyuan Sword grew. He merged with the sword and directly slashed toward the early-stage Immortal King.

"Quickly recover!" The other early-stage Immortal King's face was dark. He flew up and met Luotian's attack. The collision sound echoed again.

Although Luotian had suffered heavy injuries, the early-stage Immortal King hadn't been harmed at all. However, Luotian relied on his powerful body to maneuver with the early-stage Immortal King.

"Almost there, almost there!" Luotian muttered to himself. As the day's time was about to pass, he could feel his dantian recovering. Dense demonic energy began to erupt from the demon platform in his dantian, flowing through his limbs and recovering his injuries.

"What's going on? His power is increasing again!" The early-stage Immortal King, who was fighting with Luotian, felt that even though he had suffered heavy injuries, his power was growing stronger. Each confrontation increased significantly, making him feel increasingly exhausted.

"Black Moon Slash!" The early-stage Immortal King felt that if he didn't deal with Luotian, he would inevitably be suppressed. He finally used his ultimate technique.

The power swept across the battlefield. A black sword beam erupted from the middle-aged man's hand, emitting a series of sword cries and exuding an icy cold aura.

In the next moment, the sword beam flew from the middle-aged man's hand toward Luotian.

Faced with the early-stage Immortal King's full power attack, Luotian was serious. He waved his hands and the flame mark on his forehead flickered. A series of nine-colored fire dragons flew from Luotian's hands toward the black sword beam, roaring.

The fire dragons burned through space and collided with the black sword beam. The nine-colored long dragons were destroyed by the black sword beam.

Nine fire dragons turned into sparks, floating in the air. The temperature of the entire world increased significantly. However, although the fire dragons' power was terrifying, the black sword beam was even more powerful and shattered the nine fire dragons before continuing toward Luotian.

"Eight Directions of Treasure!" Luotian's face was pale. He extended his hand and an invisible wave flew from his hands, affecting the black sword beam.

"Pu..." In a moment, Luotian's sword beam rose with snowflakes. The early-stage Immortal King was now standing in front of Luotian.

"What's the matter!" The middle-aged man's face showed disbelief. He had intended to pierce Luotian's heart, but in the end, it had deviated from its position.

The sword dripped blood and pierced Luotian's shoulder. Luotian's face was pale like a piece of white paper, but his eyes were looking at the middle-aged man.

"Roar..." In an instant, a thunderous roar echoed from Luotian's mouth. The divine power spread out and passed through Luotian's mouth.

"Ahh..." A violent wave immediately hit the early-stage Immortal King, and his body was pushed back by the impact. Blood gushed from his seven orifices.

"Kill!" Luotian didn't care, throwing the Mo Ming Sword toward the early-stage Immortal King who had been wounded by his roar.

"Sound wave martial art!" People were shocked, watching Luotian breathing heavily.

"Crack..." At this moment, Luotian's body emitted a series of crackling sounds. His body slightly trembled.

"Finally recovered!" Luotian panted, and his aura rose sharply.

"Roar..." Two roars echoed. Long Jie and Yao Chen shouted, their power rapidly rising.

"Old man, you really enjoyed beating me before. Do you want me to be a doorman!" Yao Chen shouted, his power swallowing the mountains and rivers. He swung his staff toward Qin Chuan.

"Damned..." Qin Chuan's face changed. Seeing the powerful staff descending, he raised his withered wood to meet it. Thunder rose; Qin Chuan was already exhausted from being surrounded by Nan Gong Yuqing and others, and his confrontation with Yao Chen directly made him spit blood.

Before Qin Chuan could steady himself, a golden dragon tail broke through the void and struck Qin Chuan's body. It turned him into a mist of blood.

The second Immortal King fell, and Qin Chuan from Tiancang Sect was dead. People's faces were full of disbelief as they looked at Long Jie and others.

"Kill..." Luotian shouted, transforming into a golden-winged great phoenix and rushing toward the early-stage Immortal King who had been hit by the poison needle.

Boom... Boom...

Luotian's aura soared. His body shattered the sky, making the early-stage Immortal King's face change and his eyes filled with endless hatred.

Because he realized that even though he had resisted the poison, his private parts couldn't recover. This made him furious.

"I'll fight with you!" The early-stage Immortal King shouted, his body shaking and growing. A shocking power radiated from him, and he directly charged toward Luotian.

"Mo..." A bull-shaped illusion appeared around the middle-aged man, and a powerful aura made the world change.

"Body cultivation?" Luotian muttered to himself. He was now so strong that even with his Heavenly Demon Body Release still not released, he felt confident enough to fight against a middle-stage Immortal King.

While running, he activated the Law of the Universe and formed a giant ten thousand zhang tall. He collided with the early-stage Immortal King.

The world roared, and the eight directions trembled. The bull illusion shattered violently and turned into a terrifying storm that disappeared from people's sight.

"Godly Fury Stomps the Nine Heavens!" The storm floated, and a cold voice echoed. Luotian stood in the center of the storm and took one step.

"Boom..." The middle-aged man was directly crushed and fell into Huan Tian Sea, creating a massive wave.

At the same time, Long Jie and Yao Chen surrounded the early-stage Immortal King who was fighting with Chen Zhanbiao.

The situation turned again. Luotian stood in the world, watching the Tianyuan Sect and Tiancang Valley disciples still fighting each other. He waved his hands.

"Fire of Burning Heaven Formation!" The previous fire sparks instantly ignited, forming a vast sea of fire.

Terrifying flames swept over and took the lives of countless Tiancang Valley disciples.

"Ahh..." Qian Huaiyuan shouted, his body covered with wounds. He knew Tiancang Valley was doomed. Even if they won this battle, Tiancang Valley would be destroyed. Qin He Feng was still desperately resisting; he had reached his limit and could no longer endure.

The battle was brutal. Not only did Tiancang Valley suffer heavy losses, but so did the Tianyuan Sect. Four million people had died or been injured more than half. If it weren't for the Merfolk Clan's help, Tianyuan Sect would have been wiped out. High-level combat power was injured everywhere. Huo Zhu hadn't come out yet, and Xiang Tianming had recovered to the early stage of Immortal King. His condition was much better, but he had been enduring heavy injuries while leading the Tianyuan Sect disciples in battle.

"Victory!" However, the Tianyuan Sect people were excited because they had won. They had defeated the second-ranked Tiancang Sect in Zhongtian, it was just a matter of time.

Luotian panted heavily. Xiang Tianming gathered with Luotian, and now they had two more early-stage Immortal Kings.

"Buddha..." However, as Luotian and others were about to end the battle, a golden figure flew from afar. He wore red robes, and his bright bald head appeared before he arrived.

A senior monk stood with his hands clasped as if standing there, but he appeared on the battlefield. Behind him stood two early-stage Immortal Kings with serene faces.

"Baiye!" Luotian exclaimed, but he couldn't send out his voice. He looked at the senior monk with disbelief and a bitter smile in his heart.

"Little friend, we met again!" Baiye smiled and looked at Luotian. He was also surprised by Luotian's strong state, but Baiye noticed that Luotian was just outwardly strong and supported by a secret method.

"Done..." Seeing Baiye and Luotian greeting each other, Qian Huaiyuan felt even more desperate. He hadn't expected Luotian to have another reinforcement.

"Master, can we talk about it later?" Luotian smiled awkwardly and spoke to Baiye.

"I just want to retrieve my treasure from the Xu Mi Mountain, Zhao Tian Pagoda. I suppose you won't object, right?" Baiye spoke softly, and Luotian cursed inwardly.

Chapter 2409: The Hope of Victory

"Unsurpassed, the high monk from Xu Mi Mountain speaks so eloquently about stealing things!" Hearing Baiye's words, Luotian cursed inwardly.

"Hey, Supplemental Stone. Maybe you should pretend to go with them?" Then Luotian started communicating with the Supplemental Stone.

"..."

"Luotian, don't be too much. I have followed you already, which is a great honor for me. Now you want the world's first stone to go to Xu Mi Mountain and listen to a bunch of monks reciting sutras all day. I can't lose face!" The Supplemental Stone shouted.

"Seems like your injuries have healed!" Hearing the Supplemental Stone's confident shouting, Luotian immediately confirmed it.

"Baiye, your actions are taking advantage of the situation. Isn't that a bit inappropriate? It's not the way for monks to act!" Luotian said, trying to delay time.

"I have many good relationships with high monks from Xu Mi Mountain. Jie Du and Zhi Hong are my close friends!"

"We're all friends, so let's deal with this matter first and then talk about the Zhao Tian Pagoda issue. How does that sound?" Luotian smiled, trying to delay time.

"This isn't a battle for the heavens! It's so difficult!" Luotian sighed inwardly, while recovering his injuries.

"Daydreaming. The Zhao Tian Pagoda is my Xu Mi Mountain's treasure, how could you touch it? Give back the Zhao Tian Pagoda quickly or else I'll take advantage of this opportunity!" Before Baiye could respond, one of the monks shouted.

"Jie Se, your words are not appropriate. Our Xu Mi Mountain has always been compassionate!" Another monk spoke softly.

Luotian looked at other battlefields. Shui Changkong had basically won, and so had Shui Li. Lu Chong and Meng Hongchen were fighting fiercely. As for the early-stage Immortal King surrounded by Long Jie and Yao Chen, he was already exhausted.

"I can't accept it!" Qian Huaiyuan roared. He watched Tiancang Sect being wiped out bit by bit and knew he was no longer capable.

"Roar..." In an instant, Qian Huaiyuan's body radiated a terrifying aura. Green symbols flew from his hands and attached to his body.

Boom... Boom...

The aura soared, and Qian Huaiyuan had briefly ascended to the late stage of Immortal King. However, it was only for a moment, like a last burst of light before fading.

But Qian Huaiyuan didn't attack Shui Changkong. Instead, he dove downward toward Qin He Feng and slapped him with his hand.

"Boom..." Shui Li was directly smashed away, falling into Huan Tian Sea.

"I want to leave a last hope for Tiancang Sect!" Qian Huaiyuan roared. He didn't want Tiancang Sect to be completely wiped out, so he had to sacrifice himself to leave a last hope for Tiancang Sect.

In an instant, Qian Huaiyuan waved his hands and etched symbols onto Qin He Feng's body. A cicada's cry rose.

"Grandfather!" Qin He Feng, who had been exhausted, was hit by the symbols. His aura began to rise.

"Buzz..." The space on both sides of Qin He Feng trembled. Qian Tianming's body gradually became transparent, and a wild wave wrapped around Qin He Feng—this was the cocooning process. However, this time it burned Qian Tianming's cultivation and life.

"Open!" Qian Tianming shouted, and his transparent figure shattered. He reformed and slashed the cocoon.

Light spread everywhere, mist rose, and in the next moment, a golden butterfly flew out of the cocoon. Its golden wings were dazzling and radiated an astonishing aura.

"Boom..."

However, before the butterfly could fully appear in people's sight, the broken cocoon exploded and shattered space.

"Go..." Qian Tianming's voice echoed faintly. The golden butterfly flew into the broken space, and within it was Qin He Feng's body.

"Run?" Luotian's mouth twitched, watching the space heal itself. He didn't chase after them.

"You should have said you wanted to run earlier! We wouldn't let you escape. Why would you need to burn yourself and sacrifice your life!" However, Luotian spoke afterwards. If Qian Tianming was still alive, he would have been furious.

"Meng Hongchen, are you still determined to fight?" With Qian Tianming burning himself and sending Qin He Feng away, only Meng Hongchen remained. Meanwhile, Long Jie and Yao Chen were still fighting.

"Respect the will of a great being!" Meng Hongchen's eyes showed determination. He had come here with preparation. If he hadn't come, the result would have been that Hongchen Sect was in trouble, just like the Gu Yuan Sect before.

Meng Hongchen knew Luotian wasn't simple. It was rare for the Eternal Immortal King to go through so much trouble to capture him.

Shui Changkong stood beside Luotian, looking at Baiye and the others. Shui Li had been severely injured by Qian Huaiyuan and was now in the Zhao Tian Pagoda, still unconscious.

"Demons and ghosts have gathered!" One monk laughed coldly, looking at Luotian and Shui Changkong.

Xiang Tianming also came to Luotian's side. All of them were injured and in poor condition.

At this moment, Tiancang Valley had lost three Immortal Kings and one escaped. The remaining people were like chickens and dogs, and it was only a matter of time before they were wiped out by Tianyuan Sect. The only problem now was Baiye and the others.

"Since you don't want to give it, I'll have to take it myself!" Baiye spoke softly. His voice was gentle but he flew toward Luotian.

"Calling us demons and ghosts, you're not worthy!" Shui Changkong shouted and unleashed his trident to block Baiye's path.

"One for each person?" Xiang Tianming spoke to Luotian and rushed toward Jie Qian, transforming into his true form. He opened his mouth and a water dragon erupted.

"Jie Se?" Luotian looked at the remaining monk, his Longyuan Sword again erupted. A feeling of fatigue appeared in Luotian's body.

After so many battles, everyone was exhausted. However, they were all still holding on. The battle resumed again, but this time Tianyuan Sect was no longer so passive since Tiancang Sect had suffered heavy losses.

Luotian also fought against the Jie Se monk. Although he was tired and had suffered heavy injuries, his attacks were still strong and didn't fall behind at all. After a half-hour of fighting, Jie Se had several injuries, while Luotian's cost was one arm shattered.

Persisting. The Tianyuan Sect side were all persisting, everyone was exhausted but couldn't stop. If they didn't hold on, it would be over.

Only Lu Chong was in good condition. The others were all injured and couldn't recover in a day or two. The only good news was that the main battlefield of Tianyuan Sect had almost finished the battle, and Tiancang Valley's casualties were even more.

"Some can't hold on!" Xiang Tianming shouted. His massive body was hit by a huge Buddha palm and he opened his mouth, spitting out a blue whirlpool from the鲲鹏's mouth.

"Damned!" Luotian cursed inwardly. He looked at Cao Dedu and others, who were also exhausted. Facing an early-stage Immortal King would be a death sentence. The only one who could still fight was Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue.

"Buzz..." Just as Luotian felt desperate, the Zhao Tian Pagoda emitted a series of vibrations. A figure appeared from within it, pale-faced but with an extremely powerful aura.

"Master Huo!" Luotian's eyes showed joy. Others were also happy.

Master Huo looked much better, and his wounds had disappeared a lot. His eyes seemed to have two fires burning.

"Meng Hongchen!" As soon as Meng Wushuang appeared, he immediately targeted Meng Hongchen because it was Meng Hongchen who had beaten him so severely.

"Roar..." In an instant, Meng Wushuang's hands moved rapidly. A scorching atmosphere spread from his hands.

"Kid, lend me Xiaoqi for a while!" Meng Wushuang spoke to Luotian. He waved his hands and pointed, sending out a purple life-fire toward Meng Hongchen.
