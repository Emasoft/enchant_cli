On the other side, Luo Tian's complexion grew increasingly ruddy, and a formidable aura radiated from his body, as if a lion long dormant had slowly awakened.

Indeed, under Luo Tian's eager anticipation, his spirit and soul finally reached completion. A surge of immense power instantly filled Luo Tian's mind, even causing Gu Qianxue and others outside the formation to sense his transformation.

"Such a formidable aura... could Luo Tian truly be entering the early stage of Sagehood?" Gu Qianxue and others watched intently at Luo Tian within the formation, awaiting his metamorphosis.

Beyond the Tianyuan Continent, four elders of the Supreme Realm instinctively trembled, their eyes filled with bewilderment. They exchanged glances, sensing a terrifying opportunity awakening within the Tianyuan Continent.

"Strain every ounce of our strength; delay is perilous. Nan Gong Yuching and Wan Lingkong are dragons among men—perhaps they still have hidden strategies!" The four elders displayed a fierce resolve, their Supreme power surging forth without restraint. Each attack could obliterate any Nine-Origin cultivator, relentlessly pounding the formation.

This assault proved too much for Wan Lingkong, who gritted his teeth and bit his finger, letting a drop of blood seep into the formation to slow their progress. Jiang Nanxuan, witnessing this, brandished a golden command flag, aiding Wan Lingkong in controlling the formation against the four Supreme elders.

"Quickly break through, Luo Tian! If you don't, our lives are forfeit!" Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi repeatedly whispered anxiously, awaiting Luo Tian's breakthrough.

Yet no one awaited Luo Tian's ascension; instead, Jiang Sici broke out in cold sweat and gasped softly.

"Shi Xi, are you alright?" Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan flew to Jiang Sici's side, noting her sweat-drenched face.

"I... I'm about to give birth..." Jiang Sici's face flushed crimson, her eyes pleading toward Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

This gaze left the two elders flustered; both were still maidenly, unversed in such matters. They momentarily panicked.

"Quickly send a mental message to your mother—she must know what to do!" Someone shouted, prompting the group's joy. They immediately sent a mental message to Luo Tian's mother, Zhang Qiuyue.

Though the Tianyuan City was distant from Wuxing Sect for an Origin Spirit cultivator, it was but a moment for Zhang Qiuyue, now a Supreme Lord. Within several breaths, she arrived at Tianyuan City, taking Jiang Sici back to Wuxing Sect—this place was too inconvenient.

"Luo Tian, wake up! Your child is coming!" Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan's eyes glistened with sorrow, whispering repeatedly.

At this moment, Luo Tian had fully recovered, a strange sensation stirring within him. He longed to burst free but felt an impenetrable barrier encasing his body, preventing any movement.

"Open... let me out!" Luo Tian's mind cried desperately, repeatedly striking the barrier.

Each of his strikes echoed like thunder, resonating within people's hearts and shaking the entire Tianyuan Continent.

"Open!" The sensation deepened, driving Luo Tian to madness, desperate to know what transpired.

"Crack..." Under Luo Tian's relentless strikes, the gray aura encasing his body finally emitted a faint crackling sound, peeling away in fragments.

Within several breaths, under the group's expectant gazes, Luo Tian's gray aura vanished entirely. A blinding golden light erupted, forcing people to instinctively close their eyes. Yet within that radiance, they felt a sacred aura, compelling them to kneel in reverence.

Thunder roared; azure lightning dragons repeatedly struck the Tianyuan City, as if plunging it into a sea of thunder. Simultaneously, the formation's banners Wan Lingkong had set vanished into golden dust, intertwining with the azure dragons.

"Hah! I've finally emerged!" A deep laugh echoed across the Tianyuan Continent, shaking all within it.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan clutched their mouths, tears spilling uncontrollably.

"Hah! My brother truly is remarkable; he overcame this!" Gu Lei and others laughed heartily, gazing at Luo Tian soaring into the sky, radiating golden light.

Luo Tian stood atop the sky, sighing as he stretched his body after months of rest. A single movement sent azure lightning swirling around him, a powerful sensation making his lips curl.

"Half-step Sage—regrettably wounded too severely; otherwise, I might have shattered through to the early Sage stage. But this suffices!" Luo Tian clenched his fists, a fierce glint in his eyes as he gazed at the four Supreme elders beyond the formation.

One glance alone sent the four elders into the stars, their faces contorted with terror. As Supreme Elders, they felt Luo Tian's presence—now he had become a terrifying entity in their eyes.

"Hey, you, Luo Tian! Are you done? Can you handle those four old men outside?" Wan Lingkong's face paled. While others observed Luo Tian's transformation, he and Jiang Nanxuan maintained the formation's operation, their exhaustion immense. This remark was made during a brief respite as the four elders momentarily faltered.

"Gratitude beyond words, Wan Xiong. The rest is in your hands!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Wan Lingkong, his face brimming with gratitude. After all, his life was saved by Wan Lingkong; without him, he would never have recovered to this state.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan sighed deeply, collapsing to the ground without further concern for the now-fragile formation.

Without Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan's support, the formation—already riddled with wounds—collapsed in a single breath. The fragile Tianyuan Continent was suddenly exposed to the four Supreme elders.

Yet, the four elders hesitated, their faces etched with conflict.

Chapter 866: The Final Confrontation with the Supreme Elders

Beyond the Tianyuan Continent, in boundless starry voids, four Supreme Elders stood with conflicted expressions.

At this moment, the formation's barrier outside the Tianyuan Continent had self-destructed, yet the four elders did not rashly enter. Instead, they stood amidst the stars, their opinions divided.

"Southern Palace Ling, I'm not aiding you—I've felt that Sage aura. That boy's strength is no joke; this favor I cannot grant. A single Sage artifact isn't worth the risk!" One gray-robed elder spoke solemnly, hinting at withdrawal. That inner fear was palpable.

"Yu Xiongxin, you're extorting! Do you know the consequences of angering our Demon Clan?" The elder addressed as Southern Palace Ling retorted coldly.

Yu Xiongxin, a rogue from the Divine Beasts Domain, had wandered star systems for years without family. When Southern Palace Ling and two Demon Clan Supreme Elders pursued Nan Gong Yuching and Wan Lingkong, they coincidentally encountered Yu Xiongxin, offering a Sage artifact to secure his aid. Yet now, Yu Xiongxin regretted it.

"Hmph. I know the consequences—annihilation of my clan. I'm but a rogue; you three, can you truly stop me today?" Yu Xiongxin scoffed, responding coldly.

Years of drifting through star systems had made Yu Xiongxin acutely perceptive of danger. He now knew that aiding Southern Palace Ling would mean certain death.

As for Southern Palace Ling's threat, Yu Xiongxin dismissed it entirely; he was alone, a lifelong adventurer. In terms of true combat power, Yu Xiongxin even had confidence to defeat Southern Palace Ling.

"Two Sage artifacts—how about that! I don't think he's fully entered the Sage stage; otherwise, he wouldn't still be inside!" Southern Palace Ling gritted his teeth, raising the stakes. At this point, they truly needed Yu Xiongxin's help.

"No interest. Farewell! I advise you not to act recklessly!" Yu Xiongxin showed no interest in the two Sage artifacts. Though they were good, one needed to live to enjoy them. Saying that, he didn't even think twice before flying into the void.

"Indeed, you have some sense. However, I didn't let you go—none of you will escape today!" A cold voice echoed. A massive pressure instantly crushed the four, enveloping Yu Xiongxin and Southern Palace Ling.

The terrifying pressure seemed to crush them, making Yu Xiongxin's face flicker with fear. His body halted instantly, unable to move a muscle.

Southern Palace Ling and the two Demon Clan Supreme Elders fared worse, their lips bleeding from the pressure.

A golden light shot skyward from the Tianyuan Continent, appearing before the four within an instant.

"Did you think to leave after destroying my Tianyuan Continent?" Luo Tian's eyes held a mocking glint, his gaze fixed on Yu Xiongxin.

"Respected elder, I apologize for my impertinence. Please forgive me!" Seeing Luo Tian's youthful face, Yu Xiongxin lowered his pride, addressing him as "respected elder." After all, Luo Tian's pressure was too overwhelming.

"Swear blood allegiance to the Tianyuan Sect for a century, and this matter is settled!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice echoing like a sovereign. His low tone seemed to bestow mercy upon a beggar, leaving no room for refusal.

"This..." Yu Xiongxin's face darkened; he had always been free-spirited. This condition was unappealing to him.

Yet seeing Luo Tian's icy gaze, Yu Xiongxin knew refusal meant certain death. He sighed inwardly, cursing his misfortune for encountering such a prodigy.

Yu Xiongxin had no choice but to swear blood allegiance to the Tianyuan Sect for a century.

Seeing Yu Xiongxin's lack of backbone, Southern Palace Ling and the two Demon Clan Supreme Elders' faces changed. They had already been weak; without Yu Xiongxin, they would certainly not match the pressure that forced them to spit blood.

"Enough. Stand aside!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with satisfaction, ordering Yu Xiongxin to stand aside. He turned, his gaze coldly fixed on Southern Palace Ling and the two others.

"As for you three... it's time to die!" Luo Tian extended his hand, a golden hand emerging instantly. It seized one of Southern Palace Ling's Supreme Elders, squeezing with immense power. In an instant, the powerful elder turned into a mist of blood, scattering across the stars.

This action caused Southern Palace Ling and the remaining Supreme Elder to tremble, their hearts filled with utmost fear.

Too powerful—Southern Palace Ling realized they had no chance against Luo Tian. Though he'd encountered Sage-level beings, the pressure now was not comparable to a Sage but beyond their current capacity.

Yu Xiongxin, witnessing Luo Tian's ease in crushing a Supreme Elder, sighed deeply, relieved he hadn't resisted. Otherwise, it would have been himself who was crushed.

"Boom..." Before the three could react, another Supreme Elder turned into blood mist, splattering onto Southern Palace Ling.

Luo Tian resembled a supreme demon king, his face curled in cruel amusement. He mused that before, he'd exhausted every method to kill a Supreme Elder but failed. Now, it was effortless to crush two—his strength had indeed improved greatly.

"I truly wonder what it would be like to enter the early Sage stage—how formidable would a Sage's peak be!" Luo Tian mused, his mind involuntarily recalling the Sage-level elder from the Netherworld.

"You know who we are, yet you dare kill our Demon Clan members!" Southern Palace Ling's face showed fear as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Merely a disgraceful traitor who lost his clan's honor!" Before Luo Tian could respond, Nan Gong Yuching appeared before him, blood-chilling intent in his eyes.

"Nan Gong Yuching? You're also a Demon Clan member—how dare you watch your kin perish!" Southern Palace Ling momentarily forgot his prior pursuit of Nan Gong Yuching, hope flickering in his eyes for Nan Gong Yuching to plead on his behalf.

But would Nan Gong Yuching? The answer was no. His eyes held disdain, looking at Southern Palace Ling as one would a fool: "The Demon Clan—what remains of its former might? Though I was young when I left the Demon Clan, I know they are never bendable. What about you?"

"You! By lineage, I am your uncle!" Southern Palace Ling persisted, desperate.

"Hah! Uncle? Do you deserve it? An uncle who sent people to kill his nephew—do you even qualify as my uncle? I can tell you, when Elder Zun led me out of the Divine Beasts Domain, I severed all ties with the Demon Clan. We are enemies! And in the future, I will return to the Demon Clan and reclaim what was lost!" Nan Gong Yuching's face bore wild madness, his blood energy forming a crimson dragon that roared.

Seeing Nan Gong Yuching's madness, Luo Tian sighed softly, his eyes filled with pity. What could be more painful than betrayal by family?

"Kill! Kill! Kill!" As if influenced by the emotion, Nan Gong Yuching's eyes turned crimson. He brandished his bloodstained magic sword and rushed toward Southern Palace Ling.

Southern Palace Ling did not slacken; he remembered how one Supreme Elder had nearly lost his life chasing Nan Gong Yuching and Wan Lingkong, escaping back to the Demon Clan. He knew Nan Gong Yuching's strength was terrifying.

Plus, there was the formidable Luo Tian standing by—his pressure alone made Southern Palace Ling feel short of breath.

A black ribbon shot from Southern Palace Ling's hand, like a vast ocean, sweeping through the stars toward Nan Gong Yuching.

"Did you think to use a Sage artifact from the start? Did I allow you to resist?" Luo Tian's face turned cold. He pointed, golden light surged forth. A golden hand凝聚, seizing the black ribbon as if picking up a chick.

The mighty black ribbon cried out in agony, shrinking to three feet long, emitting dark light in Luo Tian's hand.

At the same time, the half-step Sage pressure descended upon Southern Palace Ling again, making his face change. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to give him no chance at all.

Originally, Southern Palace Ling had thought Luo Tian would let Nan Gong Yuching and him fight, then use his capture of Nan Gong Yuching as leverage to secure a chance. But now he realized he was wrong—Luo Tian gave him no opportunity at all, his pressure making it hard to move.

"Luo Tian, don't underestimate me! Do you know my status in the Demon Clan?" Southern Palace Ling's face darkened, his voice fierce.

"Pu..." However, Nan Gong Yuching's bloodstained sword gave no chance for Southern Palace Ling to speak. It pierced into his body, not hitting the vital spot but draining much of his blood due to its nature. Southern Palace Ling's face paled.

Before he could speak, Nan Gong Yuching's second strike followed, slicing onto his shoulder. Southern Palace Ling's face paled further.

"This is what you forced me to do!" Southern Palace Ling roared, his face filled with deep regret. He held a lamp.

Chapter 867: Another Sage Encounter

In boundless starry voids, Southern Palace Ling's face darkened with fury. His eyes held intense regret and hatred as he gazed at Luo Tian and the crazed Nan Gong Yuching.

Southern Palace Ling waved his hand, a green lamp appearing in Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuching's view. Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly.

"The Demon Clan truly is a great clan; even a Supreme Elder possesses two Sage artifacts. It seems the Demon Clan isn't as simple as imagined!" Luo Tian mused silently.

"Luo Tian, this is your doing!" Southern Palace Ling's face twisted with grotesque fury. He pointed his finger, breaking free from Luo Tian's overwhelming pressure. His Supreme power transformed into a rainbow streak, injected into the lamp.

"Buzz..." At the moment Southern Palace Ling's Supreme power entered the lamp, a massive pressure enveloped Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuching. Nan Gong Yuching's flight paused, regaining clarity.

The green lamp expanded slowly, its white wick ignited by Supreme power, glowing with radiant light. It illuminated the black void, emitting a sacred aura from its flame.

This aura was familiar to Luo Tian, though he hadn't entered the Sage stage. He knew the unique aura of a Sage.

"Even if it's a Sage artifact, what can you achieve with it? Thank you for giving me two!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice laced with contempt. Yet he stood before Nan Gong Yuching.

"Haha, you think it's that simple? The Demon Clan's depth is beyond your comprehension!" Southern Palace Ling's face twisted with madness, his mind trembling.

This lamp was no ordinary Sage artifact; it could summon a Demon Clan Sage's phantom, a gift from the Sage after Southern Palace Ling's near-death mission for the clan.

Southern Palace Ling wasn't foolish; he knew even if he unleashed a Sage artifact, it wouldn't match Luo Tian. Like the previous ribbon, it was taken in moments.

Southern Palace Ling's words made Luo Tian frown slightly, his mind cautious. The Demon Clan's depth was undeniable; even Elder Zun in Tiger Fortress feared them, not daring to appear. The Demon Clan's strength was evident.

"Luo Tian, now let me go—this time I've lost. If not, we'll both perish!" Southern Palace Ling's voice was fierce, still filled with regret.

This was his last resort; he didn't want to waste it recklessly. Though Luo Tian had crushed two Supreme Elders, Southern Palace Ling hadn't wanted to use the lamp. It wasn't that he didn't want to save them, but he was reluctant—this lamp was his second life. With it, he could roam the Nine Realms without fear unless encountering a Sage.

Sages were few in the Nine Realms; meeting one was rare. This lamp was Southern Palace Ling's lifeblood, making it hard to part with.

"Fish and net—do you think you're worthy? Show your tricks quickly; I have other matters to attend!" Luo Tian's face showed contempt. His spear, Lie Tian, was slowly drawn.

Since entering the Supreme Realm, Luo Tian rarely used Lie Tian; it was an Imperial-grade weapon, too weak for a Supreme Elder.

"Buzz..." Lie Tian's emergence caused it to emit discontent, making Luo Tian smile slightly.

"Alright, alright. When you enter the Sage grade, I'll let you out!" Luo Tian comforted it, then placed Lie Tian into his dantian for cultivation.

Now that Luo Tian had reached half-step Sage, his dantian was no longer black but golden and sacred. Golden energy flowed like a spring from the dantian, indicating the unique power of Sage—transcending Supreme power.

Luo Tian's half-step Sage status had changed his dantian, now capable of cultivating his own Sage artifact.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian comforted Lie Tian, the lamp Southern Palace Ling had summoned finally erupted. A radiant figure emerged from its light.

The golden phantom appeared as an old man, his aura matching Luo Tian's half-step Sage.

"Nan Gong Ling?" The old man furrowed his brows, gazing at Southern Palace Ling with respect.

"Unexpectedly, you're so useless; I gave you the Phantom Lamp for a hundred years, yet you've already activated it!" The old man's face bore coldness. His voice thundered, disappointment in his gaze.

"Grandfather, it's not like that! This boy is too powerful!" Southern Palace Ling quickly explained, gazing at Luo Tian's calm face.

"Oh?" Hearing Southern Palace Ling's words, the old man turned his gaze toward Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuching, surprise in his eyes.

"Bloodstained Magic Sword—were you the bastard taken by Nan Gong Hongyi? I never thought you'd still be alive. Now, finish him!" The old man's voice was lofty, his pressure crushing Nan Gong Yuching.

Seeing the old man's phantom, Yu Xiongxin felt a jolt. This was clearly a Demon Clan ancestor, his strength beyond comprehension. Yu Xiongxin sighed inwardly, gazing at Luo Tian—whether he could match this Demon Clan ancestor's projection. If not, he might not survive today.

"Only a phantom—don't expect to take anyone! Stay and die!" A cold voice echoed. A golden streak appeared before the Demon Clan Sage, a golden fist凝聚, launching a divine punch to devour the old man.

"Oh, I see you have a half-step Sage backing you. Indeed impressive. But Sage-level beings are beyond your comprehension. My projection alone suffices!" The old man's face showed contempt, his body no longer radiating gold but black mist. His aged appearance was shrouded in dark fog, his body solid as he punched Luo Tian.

A massive explosion erupted, making Nan Gong Yuching and Southern Palace Ling, along with Yu Xiongxin, recoil in fear. Their bodies moved to a thousand miles away from the battlefield.

"This..." The three's eyes widened in fear, surprised that two could clash so powerfully their aura alone sent them flying.

Thunderous explosions echoed as Luo Tian and the old man touched, both instantly retreating with cautious expressions.

"Boy, don't resist. Though I'm just a phantom, I can convert Sage power into demon energy. Most half-step Sages cannot match me!" The old man's face showed confidence, his fist striking again.

The sky was pressed down; countless stars fell, and a vast black mist sealed the space. It formed a colossal fist, crushing Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes were serious; he couldn't afford any negligence. He remembered how a single Sage's finger had left him in chaos. Now, this old man was solid—his caution was essential.

His hands moved swiftly, five golden seals凝聚 instantly, their immense pressure clashing with the old man's black fist. The stars seemed to be torn apart by their clash, forming swirling black holes that sucked in everything.

Yet neither felt the suction's power, clashing endlessly. Thunder and lightning roared in the stars, spreading outward, leaving Yu Xiongxin, Southern Palace Ling, and Nan Gong Yuching in awe.

"If this is just a half-step Sage, how formidable would a true Sage be?!" Nan Gong Yuching's face showed fervor. He clenched his fists, feeling the gap between himself and Luo Tian. Now a half-step Sage, he was one step away from becoming a true Sage. Yet he remained in the Supreme Realm, feeling a pang of loss.

"Boom..." The deep sound echoed as Luo Tian and the old man finally appeared in view, making Southern Palace Ling's face pale.

Though his grandfather remained powerful, compared to the Demon Clan ancestor, Luo Tian was in a worse state. Blood with golden sheen trickled from his lips, like meteors falling into the void.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing this, Nan Gong Yuching and Yu Xiongxin's faces showed anxiety.

They didn't know that although Luo Tian looked wounded, the Demon Clan ancestor's phantom was no better off. As a phantom, it couldn't reveal the old man's true condition.

"Indeed, this was just a warm-up. Now it's time to finish you!" The Demon Clan ancestor smiled, grabbing the lamp nearby and radiating immense power.

"Indeed, the warm-up is over. You're no better!" Luo Tian stretched his body, his dantian's golden whirlpool reversing.

Chapter 868: Six Blades to Slay the Demon

In starry voids, the Demon Clan Sage ancestor's solid phantom bore cold killing intent. His body was shrouded in black mist, holding the green lamp, making the stars feel cold.

The Sage artifact lamp radiated brilliant white light, clashing with the Demon Clan ancestor's black mist. Yet both emanated terrifying power, leaving Luo Tian in awe.

"Phantom Demon Lamp!" The Demon Clan ancestor smiled lightly, caressing the lamp's body. Black demon energy formed seals, merging into the lamp, making its golden flame flicker slightly.

Seeing this, Luo Tian's eyes narrowed, a dangerous aura surging into his mind.

"Buzz..." As the Demon Clan ancestor's black seals merged with the lamp, it instantly transformed. The green lamp seemed devoured, its golden flame turning black in an instant.

"Haha, boy! What will you use to block now? With this Phantom Demon Lamp's enhancement, my phantom is but a step away from the early Sage stage. You're no match for me!" The Demon Clan ancestor's face showed arrogance, his confidence as a Sage radiating. He seemed like an invincible demon king, making people fear him.

Yet Luo Tian didn't answer the Demon Clan ancestor's words. He felt his dantian's whirlpool reversing, turning black. His lips curled slightly.

"What do you think?" Luo Tian sneered, dark mist rising endlessly. It formed black dragons swirling around him, diving into his body with thunderous roars.

"What? How did you learn our Demon Clan's method of converting demon energy!" The Demon Clan ancestor gazed at Luo Tian, whose power now surpassed his.

"Your Demon Clan—what are you? A traitor who betrayed the sect and murdered its leader!" Luo Tian sneered, his black demon sword descending. His long black hair fluttered without wind; a mocking glint in his eyes, he raised the sword. Three blades凝聚 instantly, slicing through space toward the Demon Clan ancestor.

"This attack—do you think it can harm me? You're dreaming!" The Demon Clan ancestor's face showed contempt, but his mind was wary. After all, Luo Tian felt terrifying now.

As he spoke, the Demon Clan ancestor's eyes flashed with ferocity. He channeled his Sage power into the Phantom Demon Lamp, unleashing a blinding black light. Three black flames shot from the lamp's wick, attaching to Luo Tian's blades and blocking them.

"This is just the beginning!" Seeing his attack blocked, Luo Tian showed no surprise.

Though he was now immensely powerful, the first three blades of his "Seven Demon Blades" could kill any Supreme Elder. Yet to slay a phantom just one step from the early Sage stage, it was still insufficient.

"Fourth blade!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. The fourth blade roared forward, instantly appearing above the Demon Clan ancestor's head. The immense pressure made him tremble. Luo Tian gave no chance for respite, attacks coming one after another.

"Haha, I'll play with you. At most, it costs this phantom's life force!" The Demon Clan ancestor was fearless, his Phantom Demon Lamp radiating black light again to block Luo Tian's fourth blade.

"Boom..." Both were formidable; each attack could obliterate any Supreme Elder. The immense pressure made Nan Gong Yuching and the others feel short of breath.

Even the vast Tianyuan Continent, transferred a thousand miles away, felt tremors, making its people shocked.

They knew the Tianyuan Continent had another enemy invasion. Their hero, Luo Tian, had just recovered from his wounds but was already fighting again to protect the unripe Tianyuan Continent.

"I wish I could fight with Luo Tian! But our strength is too far behind this genius!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei, among others, spoke rarely but now fell silent, their faces filled with longing. They hadn't fought alongside Luo Tian in years; the feeling was uncomfortable.

"Haha, don't worry. After this matter is settled, I'll help you improve your strength!" Wan Lingkong patted Zheng Xin's shoulder, smiling as he spoke to the group.

Hearing Wan Lingkong's words, their eyes brightened. Knowing Wan Lingkong could set up the "Eternal Preservation" formation, arranging a strength-enhancing formation was trivial.

While people on the Tianyuan Continent gazed at Wan Lingkong like a treasure, Luo Tian and the Demon Clan ancestor's battle reached its climax.

In short time, they clashed again several times. Each collision caused vast voids to collapse.

The more they fought, the more cautious they became. Luo Tian marveled at how a phantom could be so powerful; the Demon Clan ancestor, however, suffered greatly. Each of Luo Tian's slashes increased in power—five blades left him battered.

Most unbearable was that the Demon Clan ancestor was merely a phantom, not even a clone. He couldn't fight for long; the longer it lasted, the weaker he became.

"Can't continue like this—I'll be drained to death. I must end this, even if it costs this projection and some life force! This boy's talent and his connection with Nan Gong Yuching will surely be a major threat to our Demon Clan in the future!" The Demon Clan ancestor mused, thinking of pros and cons while blocking Luo Tian's attacks.

"Flame of Demon Heaven!" Thinking this, the Demon Clan ancestor finally fought desperately. His solid phantom instantly faded into three drops of golden blood, flying toward the Phantom Demon Lamp above him.

"Hmm?" Sensing the Demon Clan ancestor's weakness, Luo Tian's brows furrowed. His eyes flashed with cold light as he tightly raised his black demon sword above his head.

"Rippling..." As the Demon Clan ancestor's three drops of life force entered the Phantom Demon Lamp, the sky suddenly changed. It seemed fuel had been added, and black flames surged forth with terrifying heat, floating in the dark void. From afar, it looked like the entire sky was set ablaze, forming a black ocean that rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Terrifying! What fire is this? Why do I feel it would burn me if touched?" Yu Xiongxin's eyes showed endless fear, gazing at the black flames like a river.
