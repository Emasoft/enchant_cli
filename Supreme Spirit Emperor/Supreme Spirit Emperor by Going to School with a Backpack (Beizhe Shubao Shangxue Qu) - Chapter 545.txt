“Nascent Soul!” Luo Shui bellowed, lifting his long sword and leaping into the air like a meteor. As he flew, his aura surged to the threshold of an Immortal King.

“Nascent Soul Seal!” Beside Luo Tian, Luo Tai’s face darkened slightly, his eyes filled with bitterness.

“What is the Nascent Soul Seal?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, asking as he sensed its unusual nature. The technique had elevated Luo Shui from the peak of a True Immortal to the threshold of an Immortal King—yet the price Luo Shui paid was immense.

“Nascent Soul means sacrificing oneself, offering one’s body as sustenance to ghosts in pursuit of a fleeting enhancement. However, within ten years, one’s meridians would be ruined, and one’s cultivation would be devoured by the ghosts within. Recovery would only come gradually.”

“If mishandled, one might be entirely consumed by the ghosts!” Luo Tai’s eyes glistened with bitterness as he gazed at Luo Shui, whose aura now soared skyward.

“Back then, during the Battle of the Gate of Hell, Shui had used it once to save me. But his will to return home kept him alive!”

“This Nascent Soul technique may only be used thrice in a lifetime, and each use grows more severe. After the third time, one would be completely devoured by the parasitic ghosts!” Luo Tai explained the Nascent Soul technique to Luo Tian. Upon hearing this, Luo Tian fell silent, stunned by Luo Shui’s sacrifice. This Nascent Soul technique could cost Luo Shui half his life, yet the descending blade aura was equally terrifying. Even Luo Shui bore a look of solemnity. Thunder crackled, and in an instant, the black blade aura clashed with Luo Shui’s Autumn Water Sword. The earth-shaking sound echoed in the ears of all, and Luo Shui’s body was immediately crushed to the ground. The five black long swords embedded in the earth shattered one by one, scattering into fragments that lost their divine essence. Blood spewed from Luo Shui’s mouth, his face as pale as a sheet of paper. Luo Chengyang and the five True Immortal peak cultivators also spat blood, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Shui standing there.

“I don’t believe you can withstand it!”

“Strike again!” Luo Chengyang roared, his voice laced with madness. If they failed to destroy Luo Shui, all would suffer. His hands formed seals, and black energy coalesced in the sky. The earth-shaking blade aura thundered toward Luo Shui.

“Autumn Water Heaven!” Luo Shui bellowed, and his Autumn Water Sword flared again. The world darkened as the sword transformed into a black river, sweeping toward the descending blade aura.

“Rippling…!” The sound of waves roared as the black blade aura cleaved through the river, severing it. The blade aura weakened but still struck Luo Shui, sending him plummeting from the sky. Blood stained his robes, and his aura weakened significantly. The grotesque ghost face on his chest dimmed slightly.

“Using softness to overcome hardness?” Luo Chengyang’s eyes gleamed with admiration. Luo Shui had become the head of the Luo family, his talent undeniably outstanding. Once a prodigy among Beast Kings, he had now wielded the second strike. Though Luo Chengyang and his group were also weakened, their condition was far better than Luo Shui’s.

“You can withstand two strikes. What about the third and fourth? We have five in total. How will you block them?” Luo Chengyang’s eyes flashed with disdain as he and the five others activated their remaining three long swords.

“Luo Shui! Three Thousand!” Luo Shui roared, and a thousand sword glows erupted from his hands. Each radiated an awe-inspiring aura, causing the Dao to tremble as they flew toward the descending blade. The clashing sounds echoed endlessly, each sword glows resisting the blade’s descent until they annihilated it.

“Master Luo Shui’s Autumn Water Heaven, and the Three Thousand Sword Glows!” The Luo family members were stunned as they watched Luo Shui standing there, holding his long sword.

“Master is still Master. Though he hasn’t fought in years, he remains formidable, capable of withstanding an Immortal King’s strike multiple times!” The Luo family murmured in reverence.

“Buzz…” As people whispered, the fourth black blade aura descended across the sky toward Luo Shui, who was panting heavily. Luo Shui’s eyes showed weakness as he gazed at the seemingly slow but rapidly approaching blade. He bit his lip and spat blood onto the Autumn Water Sword. The blood stained it red, instantly transforming into a crimson blade as if establishing some connection. It began to siphon Luo Shui’s vitality, emitting a continuous hum as if protesting his actions.

“Strike…” The blood aura flickered, transforming into a crimson serpent that roared toward the black blade. The serpentine dragon swallowed heaven and earth, colliding with the blade but being split in two. The black blade still descended toward Luo Shui, striking his raised Autumn Water Sword. An invisible wave swept over Luo Shui, and the sound of bones cracking echoed as his arm shattered. The Autumn Water Sword fell to the ground, its surface riddled with cracks and losing its divine essence.

“Haha! Luo Shui, now you can’t even hold your sword. How will you block our fifth strike?” Luo Chengyang’s eyes gleamed with triumph as he gazed at the trembling Luo Shui. At this moment, the six of them were not in good shape; their bodies trembled but remained standing. Five strikes had been their limit, and if Luo Ping were here, it would be six.

“Buzz…” The black blade aura coalesced again, its wild energy sweeping across the heavens.

“I’ll use myself as a shield!” Luo Shui’s face showed a faint smile as he turned to gaze at Luo Tian and Luo Tai. “When they strike that final blow, take Chen’er and flee!”

“I’m sorry for disappointing you, son. I’ve made you suffer these years!” Luo Shui spoke, his gaze on Luo Tai and Luo Tian.

Chapter 2085: You Are My Soldier

The blade aura pierced the heavens, radiating overwhelming power as it thundered downward toward Luo Shui. It pressed forward relentlessly, carrying the hopes of Luo Chengyang and others.

“Father has gone! You must live well!” Luo Shui’s face bore determination as he leapt into the air, rushing toward the blade that cleaved heaven and earth.

“No!” Luo Tian and Luo Tai’s faces turned ashen, their voices rising in alarm. Luo Tian extended his hand, and an invisible wave affected the black blade aura. “Eight Directions of Treasure,” he thought, but even with this technique’s defiance of fate, Luo Tian could not move the Immortal King’s attack. The black blade aura was only slightly displaced, and it even retaliated against Luo Tian, leaving his face pale. Luo Tai howled and rushed toward Luo Shui, his eyes wild with madness. Yet Luo Tai’s speed could not match Luo Shui’s full effort.

“Finally resolved!”

“Truly a thorny opponent!” Luo Chengyang and his group panted, their faces filled with intense joy. In an instant, Luo Tian reached the black blade aura’s front, his eyes resolute. Just as the black blade was about to strike Luo Shui, an unexpected event occurred: the heavens split open, and a figure stepped forth from the sky. Clad in black armor, his body radiated iron-blood energy. Two cold glows flared from the helmet’s eyes.

“Dare!” A cold voice echoed through the heavens. The newcomer extended his hand, and a long spear shot forth as a streak of light, instantly piercing the black blade aura about to strike Luo Shui. A screeching sound rang out as the black spear reversed, shattering the black blade aura into fragments of the Dao. It then exploded in a cascade of dark mist swirling through the sky. The helmet was lifted, revealing a middle-aged man with a scar across his face.

“Luo Meng! You don’t interfere in the Luo family’s matters. I’ll handle it for you!” The middle-aged man spoke with authority, his eyes filled with dignity.

“Commander!” Luo Tai’s eyes glimmered with a touch of excitement as he gazed at the middle-aged man standing in the sky.

“Boom…” Luo Shui landed on the ground, his gaze fixed upon the middle-aged man in the sky. His expression was briefly stirred but quickly turned to Luo Tai.

“Shui, I had no choice. I couldn’t watch you die. I didn’t expect Du Tianming to be the commander!” Luo Tai spoke, his eyes filled with regret.

“Come out!” The middle-aged man in the sky coldly spoke. The heavens split open, and figures emerged from the void, their faces solemn, bodies radiating iron-blood energy. Combined with the coldness of Hellish Ghost Cultivators, their aura instantly made the Luo family feel as if they had entered a storm of blood and fear. Ten thousand black-armored soldiers stood in the sky, radiating overwhelming energy like a dark cloud pressing against heaven and earth. Each chest bore a skull emblem, signifying their identity: the Hell’s Gate’s Mighty Ghost Army. The middle-aged man who had shattered the blade aura was none other than Du Tianming, the leader of the Mighty Ghost Army!

“Him!” The old man seated in the Luo family’s underground palace opened his eyes instantly upon Du Tianming’s appearance. The black serpent, a ghostly creature raised by the Luo family’s ancestor, let out a series of shrieks and coiled upward, emerging from the underground palace. Its massive body soared into the sky, instantly appearing on the square.

“That’s a black serpent! A ghostly creature raised by our Luo family!” The Luo family members gasped in astonishment as the serpent appeared.

“Who is that man?”

“The Mighty Ghost Army, the Hell’s Gate’s Gate of Hell. The strongest army under the Faceless Immortal King. Why is it appearing in our Luo family!” The Luo family members were stunned, their gazes fixed on the Mighty Ghost Army in the sky.

“Unknown to me, Commander Du, why have you come to our Luo family?” The old man atop the black serpent stood there, his face calm.

“Luo Shui is my soldier. You Luo family members wish to kill my soldier. Naturally, I must seek an explanation!” Du Tianming smiled, his gaze fixed on Luo Meng atop the serpent.

“What!” Upon hearing Du Tianming’s words, the Luo family members’ faces changed instantly. Though Luo Shui had indeed entered Hell’s Gate to fight against the City of Supplementing Heaven, they hadn’t expected him to have a connection with the commander. Luo Chengyang’s face was pale, his eyes filled with disbelief. They had calculated countless times but never anticipated this connection. It was because when Luo Shui returned, he had used the Nascent Soul technique and was still recovering slightly, making it hard to imagine any connection between Luo Shui and the commander.

“Commander Du, this is our family matter. You may not be able to interfere,” Luo Meng’s face slightly changed, surprised that Du Tianming had come for Luo Shui.

“Luo Shui!” Du Tianming grinned and then bellowed.

“Here!” Luo Shui’s face straightened instantly, his body standing upright despite the pain. His eyes glowed with excitement.

“Old soldiers never die; they just fade away. I will not allow my soldiers to be bullied after leaving the camp!”

“Back then, I was a squad leader; you were my comrades. Now I am the commander, and you are still my comrade!”

“Luo Shui, if you say a word, the Mighty Ghost Army will welcome you back anytime. This family is better off without! Just say a word, and the ten thousand soldiers of the Mighty Ghost Army will flatten the Luo family!” Du Tianming spoke loudly, his voice filled with solemnity.

“Kill…” Ten thousand Mighty Ghost Army soldiers roared in unison, their overwhelming aura sweeping the heavens. Iron-blooded killing intent instantly filled the world. The Luo family members’ faces turned pale, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at the ten thousand Mighty Ghost Army soldiers standing in the sky. Though the Luo family was strong, they were no match for the Mighty Ghost Army. A single charge from them would result in heavy casualties. Moreover, behind the Mighty Ghost Army was the entire Hell’s Gate and the Gate of Hell, with even the Faceless Immortal King supporting them. It was said that the Faceless Immortal King’s presence made even Beast Kings wary, as the Ninefold Ghost Sect was directly under the Ten Courts of Yama. Even the Eight Great Kings could not interfere in certain matters.

“This…” Luo Shui’s face slightly changed, his gaze shifting between Du Tianming and the Luo family disciples. He knew that if he spoke a word, Du Tianming would lead his troops to flatten the Luo family. But Luo Shui could not do this, as it was not about the Luo family but purely his personal grudge. As for why he was so certain, it was because he had once saved Du Tianming’s life. Back then, their squad had entered a dangerous place; not only did Luo Tai face danger but others too. It was Luo Shui’s use of the Nascent Soul technique that had saved them all.

“I want him dead!” Luo Shui pointed at Luo Chengyang.

“Also, bring this woman to me!”

“And I want my son to enter the Ten Courts of Yama. I know you, Commander Du, can do it!” Luo Shui spoke without hesitation, pointing at Duan Peizhen.

“Brothers, no need for more!” Du Tianming smiled and waved his hand. Immediately, several figures emerged from the Mighty Ghost Army, flying toward Luo Chengyang and others.

“Finally over…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, a wave of exhaustion washing over him. He hadn’t expected participating in a competition would lead to so much trouble. The figures that had emerged from the Mighty Ghost Army were all True Immortal peak cultivators. Luo Chengyang and others had already expended their strength after using the five strikes, leaving them barely at True Immortal peak. They had no chance against these figures and were quickly captured, brought before Luo Shui. Throughout the entire process, Luo Meng said nothing but watched coldly. As the elder of the Luo family and protected by the Ten Courts of Yama, unless a Great King or a Court Master of the Ten Courts of Yama had the authority to kill an Immortal Lord, Luo Meng would not intervene. He hadn’t expected Luo Shui to have such a deep connection with Du Tianming. When Luo Shui was in trouble, ten thousand Mighty Ghost Army soldiers had arrived, and Du Tianming himself had come personally, almost leaving everything behind. Luo Meng had originally planned for Luo Shui and Luo Chengyang to naturally fight each other, as whoever won would not be interfered with. However, Luo Chengyang had surprised him; even Luo Meng was wary of those five strikes. Thus, he did not want to take sides and let them fight until one killed the other. In Luo Meng’s view, only the strongest deserved to be the head of the family.

Duan Peizhen was also sealed and brought before Luo Shui, her face filled with fear.

“Luo Shui, we are husband and wife. My father is the King of Ghosts. You cannot kill me. Let me go!” Duan Peizhen immediately spoke loudly, no longer showing her former arrogance.

“Duan Peizhen, shut up!” Luo Shui bellowed, raising his hand and striking Duan Peizhen across the face.

“Chen’er, I’m a bit exhausted now. Go and kill Luo Chengyang for me!” Luo Shui turned, his gaze gentle as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Okay!” Luo Tian lifted his sword, the sound of his blade still stained with blood from Luo Bai and Luo Ping.

“Luo Chen, stop! If you stop now, it’s still not too late!” Luo Chengyang finally feared and spoke loudly.

“It’s too late. If you hadn’t hidden, you could have lived as a dog. But you insisted on thinking about things that weren’t yours!” Luo Tian spoke softly, repeating Luo Chengyang’s initial words to him, making Luo Chengyang’s face turn as red as pork liver. The sword hummed, and Luo Chengyang’s head was severed by the battle sword.

“Ah…” A scream echoed as Duan Peizhen cried out, her voice filled with fear.

“Kill! There’s no major trouble!” Du Tianming spoke to Luo Shui, who was looking at him.

“Die, you bitch!” Luo Chengyang roared, his voice filled with anguish. He transformed his palm into a blade and slashed toward Duan Peizhen.

“Plop…” Blood splattered, and Luo Shui’s palm dripped with blood. His eyes were filled with excitement.

“Lingxue, I’ve avenged you. Do you see it!” Luo Shui howled to the sky, his voice filled with relief.

“As for your nephew entering the Ten Courts of Yama, I’ll think about it. Seven days later, you’ll hear from me!” Du Tianming smiled and gazed at Luo Tian.

“Boom…” Luo Shui’s face showed a smile, his body collapsing into the view of everyone.

Chapter 2086: At Its Zenith

Seeing Luo Shui collapse, Du Tianming’s face slightly changed. He flew toward the unconscious Luo Shui and gazed coldly at the five remaining True Immortal peak cultivators who had helped Luo Chengyang kill Luo Shui. His eyes flashed with intense killing intent.

“You all should die!” Du Tianming extended his hand, and seals flew from it toward Luo Shui. The five True Immortal peak cultivators stood there, trembling and unable to move. They prayed silently for Luo Shui’s safety. They had already realized that if Luo Shui were harmed, no one could withstand Du Tianming’s fury.

“You should have said it earlier! If you had, we wouldn’t dare defy you!” The five men inwardly lamented as they gazed at Luo Shui. At this moment, Luo Shui was completely covered in black ghost faces, his meridians continuously shrinking. His life force was gradually dissipating, and the ghost face grew more grotesque, as if it were about to break free from Luo Shui.

“Hold on!”

“Master Luo Meng, come help!” Du Tianming roared and, together with Luo Meng, took Luo Shui out of the view of the Luo family members. Luo Tian also disappeared with them. The others merely stared at each other, and the five True Immortal peak cultivators remained still, unable to move because Du Tianming had placed restrictions on them. Additionally, the Mighty Ghost Army stood in the sky above, leaving no chance for escape.

In a dim palace, Luo Shui lay in pain. Du Tianming and Luo Meng continuously fought, their brows drenched in sweat. One suppressed the ghost face trying to break free while the other resisted the terrifying devouring force. The black serpent continuously exhaled cold mist to reduce Luo Shui’s pain. Luo Tian and Luo Tai stood there, helplessly watching. Luo Tai’s eyes were filled with anxiety.

“Luo Shui himself wanted to die!” Du Tianming bellowed, his eyes filled with anger. He was helping Luo Shui resist the fierce devouring force but could clearly feel that Luo Shui made no resistance.

“Luo Shui, the only one who can save you is yourself. You must not die! Have you thought about your son? He hasn’t fully risen yet!” Du Tianming roared, and Luo Shui’s brows slightly furrowed.

“You son, come call me father. Call me until you wake him up! The only one who can give him a chance at life is you!” Du Tianming shouted, grabbing Luo Tian, who was bewildered. Though he wasn’t his real son, seeing Luo Shui’s pitiful state and the scene of him blocking five strikes made Luo Tian sigh deeply.

“Little brother, I’m doing this for you. My real father, I have no choice!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly and approached Luo Shui.

“Father…” Luo Tian spoke, gazing at Luo Shui. As soon as he said it, the lifeless Luo Shui moved slightly and even slowly opened his eyes. Though his eyes were hollow.

“It worked! Call again!” Du Tianming shouted, his voice filled with joy. Luo Meng’s eyes were also full of surprise. At this moment, since Luo Chengyang was dead, if Luo Shui died too, it would fall to Luo Chen to become the head of the family. However, at this moment, Luo Chen was still too young. Though Luo Meng had some coldness, he hadn’t intervened when Luo Chengyang and Luo Shui fought so fiercely. That was because he knew one of them would inevitably survive. In the Hell, strength ruled; each generation’s head was chosen by the strongest. But Luo Shui had been weak for a long time. Though Luo Meng had some inclination toward Luo Shui, if Luo Chengyang succeeded, he wouldn’t stop him. No one expected Du Tianming to suddenly appear and kill Luo Chengyang. Now only Luo Shui remained, and Luo Meng didn’t want the family to be destroyed. After all, it was his family, and as the elder of the Luo family, he naturally felt a sense of belonging.

“Father… father…” Luo Tian kept calling out. With each word, Luo Shui’s aura grew stronger, and his eyes became clearer. An hour passed quietly. Luo Tian’s voice was hoarse, his lips cracked, and his eyes filled with sorrow as he gazed at the lying Luo Shui. He swore that he had never called his real father so many times in one hour, and he felt some guilt toward Luo Nantian. Each time he spoke, his thoughts were of Luo Nantian.

In the Nine Domains, on the Celestial Yuan Continent’s Five Elements Sect, a couple sat there. Their black hair had some silver strands.

“Sneeze… sneeze…” The man kept sneezing, his face filled with anger.

“Who is that bastard cursing me? Cursed for so many days!” The man spoke, his voice filled with anger.

“Cursing me? Maybe they miss you. Tell me, did you flirt with someone?” The man’s words had just been spoken when his ears were turned half a circle. They were Luo Tian’s parents, Luo Nantian and his wife. Luo Tian had entered the Immortal realm years ago. The Nine Domains had also undergone a complete transformation, and even Luo Nantian’s old couple had some silver strands in their hair. Before leaving, Luo Tian had left a method to seal the younger generation. The older generation still moved within the Nine Domains. Zheng Xin, Jiang Nanxuan, Xu Liziyi and others had become masters of the sect. Young talents emerged one after another. However, it seemed like a peak must be followed by decline. After the generation of talents that had blossomed like a flood, few truly astonishing geniuses emerged. The collapse of the Immortal path had changed the Nine Domains, and even the ancient royal families had fully integrated into the Nine Domains. Though there were still disputes, it didn’t affect the Nine Domains. As time passed, Zheng Xin and others had reached their limits but none had broken through the level of an Epoch Master. However, they vaguely felt a strong crisis that could destroy the Nine Domains and surpass even the chaos of the ancient royal families. If Luo Tian were in the Nine Domains, with his current cultivation, he would certainly sense it. The Nine Domains were a massive star cloud, containing countless continents within it. At this moment, a star cloud twice as large as the Nine Domains was slowly moving toward it. This happened in various places of the vast universe, and some areas had already experienced collisions between two star clouds. These star clouds were known as the Three Thousand Small Worlds! Luo Tian, at this moment, was completely unaware of these situations and was very distressed, constantly calling out. Though he was doing it for Luo Chen and to save Luo Shui, he still felt some discomfort.

Finally, with the efforts of Luo Meng and Du Tianming along with the black serpent, the grotesque ghost face gradually faded. Luo Shui’s breathing became steady, his meridians returned to normal, and his eyes regained clarity. He gazed at Luo Tian and others.

“Thank you!” Luo Shui smiled lightly, sitting up slowly. He had truly walked through hell.

“Don’t mention it, brother. Now you’re weak. I’ll leave the small knife with you and let him return when you fully recover!” Du Tianming smiled, wiping his cold sweat.

“Also, this is the life seal of these five people. Take it and decide whether to kill or spare them!” Du Tianming spoke again, imprinting a mark on Luo Shui’s forehead. Luo Shui had no words to say and gazed at Du Tianming, his eyes filled with gratitude.

“Alright. I have business in the Hell’s Gate, so I’ll leave first. This kid is good; I’ll try to arrange it for the Ten Courts of Yama within seven days!” Du Tianming nodded at Luo Meng.

“Master Luo, I was impetuous. I will definitely give you a satisfactory reply!” Du Tianming spoke, having come with an aggressive attitude but giving Luo Meng face.

“No problem. I need to enter the Ten Courts of Yama, and Du Commander must help me!” Luo Meng smiled slightly. Since Du Tianming had given him face, he naturally took the opportunity to transfer it to Luo Tian. With this said, Du Tianming would certainly do his best.

The Ten Courts of Yama were not places anyone could enter. Only the descendants of the Great Kings had the qualifications to enter. It was a place on par with the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Immortal realm.

“Of course!” Du Tianming was a sensible man, his face showing a smile. He glanced at Luo Tian and then left the palace.

“Ten Courts of Yama!” Luo Tian sighed slightly. He hadn’t entered the Nine Immortal Mountains first but was entering the Ten Courts of Yama instead.

“I’ll leave first!” Du Tianming flew into the air and left the palace. Under the respectful gaze of the Luo family members, he led ten thousand Mighty Ghost Army soldiers out of sight, leaving behind a man carrying a long sword.

“Luo Shui is still the head of our family!” After Du Tianming left, Luo Meng’s voice echoed through the Luo family, confirming Luo Shui’s position. The Luo family members dispersed, but this clan competition had spread throughout the Beast King City and even the entire city knew about it. Luo Tian’s act of killing Luo Bai had also made Luo Chen’s name known throughout the Beast King City. Everyone knew that the Luo family had a prodigy named Luo Chen. Luo Shui’s story was ordered to be sealed by Luo Meng, as it wasn’t honorable and made Luo Shui look bad. If it were known to everyone, it would be detrimental to Luo Shui. The appearance of the Mighty Ghost Army in the Luo family also caught the attention of the other two families. They knew the terrifying nature of the Mighty Ghost Army and became more cautious toward the Luo family, even avoiding conflicts when they arose. Zhang Menlie had completely left the Luo family’s gates because Luo Chen’s name was known throughout the Beast King City. As one of Luo Chen’s followers, Zhang Menlie had become renowned and even the Zhang family had voluntarily handed over those who killed his parents to the Luo family’s gates.

Chapter 2087: Wheel of Rebirth

Luo Shui and his son Luo Chen had become the talk of the Beast King City, especially Luo Chen. Previously, he hadn’t been anything more than a servant in the Luo family and many people in the Beast King City had never heard of him. The Luo family’s head, Luo Shui, had a son named Luo Chen. However, Luo Bai had become renowned throughout the Beast King City. No one expected a Luo Chen to emerge and kill Luo Bai, yet he had done so without any issues. He was even designated as the next heir of the Beast King. In an instant, Luo Chen’s name became legendary in the Beast King City, and his patience was etched into people's memories. The Luo family members understood this more deeply. From Luo Chen, they all realized the saying “a gentleman takes revenge after ten years.” However, the family members were also concerned. Luo Shui had killed Duan Peizhen, whose background was deep; she was the daughter of the King of Ghosts. If this reached the King of Ghosts, he would definitely be angry. The King of Ghosts’ city was adjacent to the Beast King City, so some people in the Luo family were worried about retaliation. Though the King of Ghosts had many offspring, he was renowned among the Eight Great Kings. However, Duan Peizhen was his daughter, and Luo Shui had killed her. The King of Ghosts would definitely retaliate for his dignity. Luo Shui’s plan to have Luo Tian enter the Ten Courts of Yama was also for this reason. If the King of Ghosts came to attack, he would have to be cautious. Moreover, the Mighty Ghost Army’s presence would make the King of Ghosts wary. Even if he didn’t care, Luo Tian’s life would be safe within the Ten Courts of Yama. Regardless, the Luo family was still one of the three major families in the Beast King City and was at its zenith. Even the other two families dared not touch the Luo family now.

In the Luo family’s courtyard, Zhang Menlie’s eyes gleamed with excitement as he gazed at Zhang Qi, whose cultivation had been nullified and was thrown before him. Behind Zhang Qi were several young men and women, his entire family. However, they were all injured, their eyes filled with despair.

“Zhang Menlie, I killed your father and mother. If you are still part of the Zhang family, then out of respect for our shared surname, let them go!” Zhang Qi’s eyes were filled with bitterness. He was the shortest-serving head of the Zhang family, having only sat for a month before becoming a prisoner.

“Dream on. I was the one who started this, and you never considered the consequences for your family!” Zhang Menlie’s face was cold as he struck with a palm, instantly splitting Zhang Qi’s head.

Zhang Menlie’s face was filled with madness as he continued to strike. In an instant, Zhang Qi’s entire lineage was killed by Zhang Menlie’s hands.

“Father, mother. I’ve avenged you. Rest in peace!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes flowed with tears, his gaze filled with intense gratitude toward the young figure approaching him.

“Master!” Zhang Menlie fell to his knees before Luo Tian. He knew that without Luo Tian, he would have had to wait a long time for revenge.

“Thank you, master. Let me kill my enemies!” Zhang Menlie spoke loudly, now fully submitting to Luo Tian. Whether it was the Ghost Cultivator or returning to the Luo family and turning things around, the most important thing was helping him avenge his enemies. Any of these points were worth Zhang Menlie’s loyalty.

“Alright, you’ve worked hard these days. I have this position because of your efforts. It’s all deserved. Rise!” Luo Tian smiled, satisfied with Zhang Menlie. Zhang Menlie was indeed a man who had impressed Luo Tian. He was intelligent and worked diligently these days, though there were elements of coercion involved. However, he handled things appropriately.

In contrast, Liu Cheng was slightly inferior to Zhang Menlie, but Luo Tian hadn’t neglected him. Instead, he had transferred Liu Cheng to a larger city to continue serving as its governor.

“From now on, you’ll follow me. I will also teach you the method of Ghost Cultivation!”

“As for the Zhang family, if you wish to return, I won’t stop you. If anything happens, feel free to come find me at the Luo family!”

“If I’m not here, you can also let the head assist you!” Luo Tian spoke, gazing at Zhang Menlie.

“Thank you, master. I am willing to follow the master!” Zhang Menlie spoke loudly, his voice filled with respect.

The Zhang family had nothing left for Zhang Menlie. Because of the incident involving his parents, he had developed hatred toward the Zhang family. Though he had voluntarily sent Zhang Qi’s entire family to him, he had lost his feelings for the family. And Luo Tian would be the next head of the family, and Zhang Menlie also knew that once Luo Tian entered the Ten Courts of Yama, any court could make the Luo family the top family under the Beast King. Even if the Beast King wanted to move against the Luo family, he would have to weigh his options. All of this depended on Luo Tian’s position within the Ten Courts.

“Good, then rest well.” Luo Tian nodded and led Zhang Menlie toward his residence. Luo Tian’s status in the Luo family naturally meant he wouldn’t live in a place that was worse than servants. He immediately took over Luo Bai’s residence and ordered the staff not to touch anything in it.

Luo Tian led Zhang Menlie toward a spacious courtyard. As they entered the main courtyard, several beautiful women approached.

“Leave! You don’t need to be here!” Luo Tian waved his hand lightly and stepped toward Luo Bai’s room. As he was about to step forward, a cold glint appeared behind him. A maid held a dagger and rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Smack…” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, knocking the dagger from her hand. His face was cold.

“Master, mercy!” All the maids’ faces turned pale as they fell to their knees before Luo Tian, fear in their eyes.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian coldly gazed at the maid he had caught, who was quite attractive and well-endowed.

“Have the guts to kill me!” The maid’s face showed madness, her mouth opening wildly toward Luo Tian’s wrist.

“Smack…” Zhang Menlie slapped the maid across the face, coldly speaking: “You don’t talk. I have ways to make you speak!”

“Who is she?” Zhang Menlie asked, gazing at the other trembling maids. His voice was as cold as ice, causing them to shiver.

“She is Wang Xiuxiang. She was the favorite maid of Master Luo Bai. Though she had no official status, everyone knew their relationship. Young master, mercy! This isn’t our fault!” One of the maids spoke.

“Where did you get this?” Luo Tian’s gaze fell on Wang Xiuxiang’s waist, his voice deep. He pulled the jade pendant from her waist.

However, Zhang Menlie saw excitement in Luo Tian’s eyes. This was the first time he had seen such excitement in Luo Tian.

“I won’t tell you. Have the guts to kill me. I don’t care if I live or die, but even as a ghost, I’ll haunt you to seek revenge!” Wang Xiuxiang spoke fiercely, her voice filled with hatred.

Luo Tian clutched the jade pendant, his hands trembling uncontrollably. His eyes stared intensely at Wang Xiuxiang, making her curses grow quieter and her trembling gaze toward Luo Tian. His eyes made her feel like she was seeing a devil.

“Soul Extraction!” Luo Tian didn’t want to waste words. He extended his hand, and a gray soul flew from Wang Xiuxiang’s body into his hands. He immediately initiated a soul extraction, showing no mercy despite her resistance.

The only possibility that could cause Luo Tian to be in such a state was encountering an old friend, and this friend was very important to Luo Tian. This jade pendant wasn’t a treasure in the Immortal realm but was considered a pseudo-Era Treasure in the Nine Domains. It had been crafted by Luo Tian for his four wives, and now it was appearing; how could he not be excited?

Luo Tian examined the exquisite jade pendant. Indeed, on its back was a small character, a star symbolizing it had been given to Fu Xingxuan. In an instant, Wang Xiuxiang’s memories appeared in Luo Tian’s mind, revealing where the jade pendant had come from.

“Damn!” Luo Tian waved his hand and sent Wang Xiuxiang’s soul back into her body. She stood there with a vacant expression.

Seeing Wang Xiuxiang’s state and Luo Tian’s previous actions, the maids were terrified. They had never seen anyone extract a person’s soul before.

Luo Tian radiated intense hostility. Wang Xiuxiang’s memories only showed that Luo Bai had given her the jade pendant, and Fu Xingxuan had fled, pursued by Luo Bai. After that, there were no clues.

“Should have not so easily killed Luo Bai!” Luo Tian felt regretful now. He had so easily killed Luo Bai, and the clue to Fu Xingxuan was lost because of it. Moreover, Fu Xingxuan had lost his jade pendant, indicating that he was in a very bad state. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have lost it.

“Kill her! Let her die in pain!” Luo Tian spoke coldly to Zhang Menlie, his face dark as he walked toward his residence. This woman wasn’t good either; she had taken the jade pendant from Fu Xingxuan, leading to Luo Bai’s pursuit of Fu Xingxuan.

“Yes!” Zhang Menlie’s face showed a touch of coldness. He wouldn’t defy Luo Tian’s words, and he extended his hand. A black ghost appeared before him.

“Desire-Inducing Ghost!” The maids gasped, their eyes filled with fear. This ghost was named for its ability to incite desire in people and then have them die from it.

“Wheel of Rebirth Master’s decree: To promote the cultivation of young talents in each city, the Wheel of Rebirth will select one person from each city to enter the Wheel of Rebirth. Whether it’s a family disciple or an Immortal Lord’s heir, all can participate in the trial. The first to pass will enter the Wheel of Rebirth!” As Luo Tian just stepped into Luo Bai’s residence, a black river appeared in the sky of the Beast King City. A cold voice echoed through the city, instantly causing its people to erupt in excitement.

Chapter 2088: Back Door

“The Wheel of Rebirth will recruit people. The strongest young generation in the Beast King City can all participate. Passing the trial allows one to enter the Wheel of Rebirth!” Everyone’s faces showed joy, not expecting the Wheel of Rebirth Master to issue such a decree. A single step could lead to ascension, for once entering the Wheel of Rebirth, one would be comparable to a King. Even more so than the Immortal Lord families of the Eight Cities.

“I must obtain the qualification to enter the Wheel of Rebirth!” The entire Beast King City erupted with determination, their eyes filled with resolve. Each family’s elders were also energized, using their family’s resources to enhance their talents. While families competed, Luo Tian was in his residence, his eyes filled with contemplation. He held a jade slip, which had been left by Luo Chen for Luo Bai. It recorded the methods of refining Earth-grade and Heaven-grade Ghost Cultivation Pills. However, these were only Luo Chen’s deductions; it was uncertain whether they could be refined. But now the method had fallen into Luo Tian’s hands, and with his expertise in alchemy, he could refine it to perfection. He just needed time.

“Woof… Woof…” A black puppy played in the courtyard. The dog was still small but had a touch of royal beast’s authority. Every night, it would sneak out and return with a full belly, as if having eaten somewhere.

“Again sneaking to eat?” Luo Tian slapped the black puppy’s head, causing it to be discontent.
