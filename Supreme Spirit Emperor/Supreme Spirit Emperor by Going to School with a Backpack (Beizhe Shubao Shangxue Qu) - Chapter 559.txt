“Hear that you carry many valuable items on your person. Today, surrender them all!” Yu Hongzhi’s battle spirit surged, causing the surrounding crowd to retreat in unison.

“This is your own doing!” Luo Tian addressed the sky as if not speaking to Yu Hongzhi, for he feared the two palace masters of Black and White Judges.

“Enough talk. Hand over your treasures now, or you’ll leave here with a part of yourself!” Yu Hongzhi roared, his crescent moon saber slicing through the air with a whirring sound as he lunged toward Luo Tian.

A crescent moon of wind surged above Luo Tian’s head, descending with a thunderous strike.

“How about this sword?” Luo Tian had no patience for further words. Seeing no response from the sky, he swung his Longyuan Sword, clashing with the crescent moon.

The collision sent shockwaves through the air. In an instant, Yu Hongzhi was hurled backward, his eyes wide with terror. Luo Tian remained motionless, a smile playing on his lips.

“Boom…” Luo Tian planted his foot, leaping into the air to appear above Yu Hongzhi. His sword descended with overwhelming might, darkening Yu Hongzhi’s face.

Yu Hongzhi was still mid-air when he raised his crescent moon saber to meet the sword’s fury. The heavens trembled, and a piercing hum filled the air.

“Crack…” The ground shattered as Yu Hongzhi knelt on one knee, spitting blood, his gaze still filled with awe.

“Good. I’ll give you another strike!” Luo Tian laughed, swinging his sword again with crushing force.

“Crack…” This time, Yu Hongzhi’s saber flew from his hand. He collapsed to his knees, the crimson scabbard of Longyuan Sword resting on his shoulder.

“Another strike, and if you don’t die, I’ll spare your life!” Luo Tian bellowed, Longyuan Sword sweeping down toward Yu Hongzhi.

“Mercy!” Yu Hongzhi roared, raising his arms to meet the descending sword. A dull thud echoed.

Blood mist rose as Yu Hongzhi was reduced to a pool of blood before the stunned onlookers, sending shivers through them.

“Even Yu Senior was slain by him! And only four strikes!” The crowd’s faces bore fear, their eyes fixed on Luo Tian standing there.

“Regrettable. You were just a step away from survival!” Luo Tian murmured, gazing at the sky before sensing no further danger. His mind now clear.

“Alright, everyone, continue!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze turning to Wan Tianyi trembling in place.

“Luo Senior’s might is truly terrifying. Truly, he is the prodigy of this era! It stirs my desire to follow him…” Wan Tianyi spoke loudly, nearly kneeling before Luo Tian, his voice laced with flattery.

Luo Tian stood silently, his gaze upon Wan Tianyi, causing the latter to shudder.

“Luo Senior is truly magnificent. To follow you is my greatest honor, Wan Tianyi! For decades, I’ve finally found my life’s purpose: to follow Luo Senior…” Wan Tianyi continued.

Luo Tian had never before relished such flattery. He’d been silenced by the Black and White Judges, but now, hearing Wan Tianyi’s sycophancy brought him a peculiar thrill.

Wan Tianyi spoke endlessly, and Luo Tian said nothing, only gazing with an enigmatic smile. Wan Tianyi redoubled his efforts.

After a quarter-hour, Luo Tian finally broke off the flattery, his lips nearly frothing. He spoke softly: “Go. Follow me to the ninety-eighth level!”

“Yes!” Wan Tianyi halted, knowing his life was spared. His eyes gleamed with excitement as he hurried after Luo Tian toward the entrance of the ninety-eighth level.

“Luo Senior’s power is truly terrifying. Only the Eight Little Heavenly Kings could match him!” The crowd murmured, their eyes filled with reverence. In Hell, strength was revered.

Zhang Tiantian’s eyes gleamed with excitement, feeling his move had been correct. Yet, the thought of Luo Tian’s subsequent plans made him tremble—yet also feel exhilaration. If Luo Tian succeeded, his lot would be far better than before in the Reincarnation Sect.

Luo Tian swept through level after level, from ninety-eighth to sixty-fifth. Only the sixty-sixth remained untouched.

Those who resisted were mercilessly slain; only temporary submission ensured survival.

A vast amount of resources fell into Luo Tian’s grasp, a terrifying haul. Even he hadn’t expected such gains.

Storms erupted as Luo Tian ignited the Reincarnation Sect’s fury. Within a day, he had slain thirty heads, and the remaining thirty-something chose submission—though whether genuine or not, Luo Tian didn’t know. He cared little.

He knew that if they failed to deliver resources, he’d kill them and replace them. It was a lucrative post, many vying for it.

Luo Tian’s speed was unmatched; no one reacted. In a single day, he had plundered sixty-five levels.

In Hell, what was most precious? Ghost Crystals. Hell’s ghost cultivators trained with them, achieving twice the results. Thus, Luo Tian’s Ghost Crystals had reached a terrifying level—equivalent to a year’s income of the Luo Clan in just one day.

Moreover, he had reduced his plunder by ten percent, leaving the Reincarnation Sect disciples unaware of any issue. In fact, they wished Luo Tian to continue.

Yet all knew the matter wouldn’t end here. Though Luo Tian had slain Yu Hongzhi and eliminated two of the top hundred disciples in the Reincarnation Sect, all knew Hell still held the Eight Little Heavenly Kings.

The Eight Little Heavenly Kings were offspring of the Eight Heavenly Kings, their status in the Reincarnation Sect legendary. Resources filtered upward to them. Luo Tian’s actions had severed their lifeline, inevitably drawing their wrath.

Chapter 2130: The Eight Little Heavenly Kings

In a quiet chamber, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, surrounded by mountains of Ghost Crystals. Black serpents of condensed energy surged into his body through eight dark ghost channels, feeding his dantian with boundless black spiritual energy, devoured by the tiny figure within.

Outside the hall, Ye Chen sat similarly, eyes closed. Yet his heart remained unsettled. He had never felt such exhilaration in Hell—though if he returned to the Immortal Realm, he’d be branded a ghost cultivator. But what did it matter? With Star River Mansion’s strength, nothing could stop him.

“Wait… I’ll make you regret this!” Ye Chen’s eyes burned with hatred, memories of several figures haunting him.

While Luo Tian and Ye Chen absorbed spiritual energy, the Reincarnation Sect erupted in chaos. The blood-soaked hall had been taken by the Ancestors, and no one expected Luo Tian’s sudden upheaval.

“Hear this—Luo Chen swept through the entire Reincarnation Sect, seizing all heads except those of the sixty-sixth level, amassing vast resources!”

“Brave indeed. Is he challenging the Eight Little Heavenly Kings openly? Does he truly possess such strength to face them alone?” The murmurs reached the Eight Little Heavenly Kings.

In the thirty-third level of the Reincarnation Sect, eight central courtyards stood—home to the Eight Little Heavenly Kings, symbolizing their status.

In one courtyard sat a youth, calm and composed, listening to his subordinates. This was Wang Gang, son of the Beast Ghost King and elder brother of Wang Lie.

“Interesting. Father’s message said if this Luo Chen arrives, we should show him courtesy. Let the others handle it; I’ll save him at the crucial moment to gain his gratitude,” Wang Gang smiled, stroking a black kitten beside him.

Nearby, a furious shout echoed. “This Luo Chen seeks death? Who gave him the audacity to defy us? I’ll kill him now!”

A black streak shot skyward, a youth cloaked in black, his eyes two overlapping orbs.

“Do you let yourselves be dominated like this?” he roared. “You’re all cowards!”

“Haha, Motian, go for it! I believe in you!” A courtyard echoed with mocking laughter.

“Motian elder brother, you’re the best! If you kill that kid, I’ll warm your bed tonight!” A sultry voice rang out. The sound sent shivers through listeners, its seductive allure overwhelming even Motian’s resolve.

“Seductress. One day I’ll pin you down!” Motian cursed inwardly, his gaze sweeping the other courtyards.

“You all just want me to test this kid’s strength, don’t you? Let’s see who holds out!” Motian glared at the others, his face dark.

Motian spoke and returned to his courtyard. Though neighbors, the Eight Little Heavenly Kings harbored rivalry, scheming against each other.

“Announce: Let this Luo Chen send his treasures himself. Cut off one arm and come to the thirty-third level to confess. I’ll overlook his past misdeeds,” Motian ordered.

Motian’s words spread swiftly, reaching Luo Tian’s ears.

“What?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow upon Zhang Tiantian’s report, a smile flickering across his face.

“Reply: What lowlife dares? If you’ve the guts, come all at once. I’ll kill each of you with one strike! What are the Eight Little Heavenly Kings? Eight little heavenly kings!”

“Knew they were cowards, hiding in their shells. Come out and show your heads; I’ll chop them off with one strike!” Luo Tian addressed Zhang Tiantian.

“This…” Zhang Tiantian trembled, gazing at Luo Tian. For years, the Eight Little Heavenly Kings had commanded reverence in the Reincarnation Sect, even elders yielding to them. No one had dared mock them before.

“Say it like that. These people are too cautious; they need more fire!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Zhang Tiantian.

“Yes!” Zhang Tiantian gritted his teeth and left Luo Tian’s chamber, relaying the reply.

“My heavens! What is this Luo Chen up to? Does he truly intend to defy the Eight Little Heavenly Kings?”

“This Luo Chen doesn’t even curse, yet ‘turtle heads’ is…” As Luo Tian’s retorts spread, they sparked another uproar. Even the elders of the thirty-third level murmured.

“Even Tianluo Poison couldn’t kill him. This kid will surely achieve much. Regrettable he’s so arrogant…” Lin Dong shook his head in the courtyard.

Upon returning, he was stunned by Luo Tian’s deeds. A man presumed dead had returned—and caused such chaos outside the Reincarnation Sect, even killing a True Immortal.

“Seeking death. He’s seeking death!” Those who had returned with Lin Dong felt exhilaration.

They’d been awed by Luo Tian’s actions, knowing his signature sword and hearing he arrived with a molten lava dragon. They realized Luo Tian was the one who had humiliated them in the Beast King’s Mountains.

They’d planned to find人脉 (connections) to trouble Luo Tian, but his lightning speed had swept through sixty-five levels. Their revenge flames died instantly.

Yet Luo Tian dared mock the Eight Little Heavenly Kings—unprecedented, causing some to smirk, waiting for his demise.

“Luo Chen!” The courtyards of the thirty-third level echoed with roars. Even Wang Gang’s face turned pale, surprised Luo Tian had insulted him too.

“I’ll break free three days hence. I’ll kill you!”

“Luo Chen, wash your neck. I’ll pluck your head!” Roars echoed.

Initially intending to observe, the Eight Little Heavenly Kings were now enraged. Who were they? Offspring of the Eight Heavenly Kings, their fathers great powers. They were heirs to the next Heavenly King. Luo Tian’s insults had enraged them.

“Trouble, but three days is manageable,” Motian smirked, dismissing the others.

“In three days, the Eight Little Heavenly Kings will head to the ninety-ninth level to kill Luo Tian!” The crowd’s eyes gleamed with excitement. Never before had the Eight Little Heavenly Kings united against one.

“Three days? Come one, I’ll kill one. Come two, I’ll kill both!” Luo Tian roared defiantly.

“Is this Luo Chen really a common clan disciple?” The crowd wondered, sensing he was playing with fire.

That same afternoon, a high platform stood in the ninety-ninth level. Luo Tian appeared atop it, cross-legged, drawing attention.

“I’m here. Come forth, Eight Little Heavenly Kings!” Luo Tian shouted, then closed his eyes.

“Provocation. Barefaced provocation!” The platform’s construction ignited the situation.

Zhang Tiantian and Ye Chen watched Luo Tian seated there, then vanished into the crowd to prepare their plans.

The next day, a rumor spread: someone secretly set up a bet on Luo Tian’s victory against the Eight Little Heavenly Kings. Odds varied—win one, win two, lose all.

“Of course Luo Chen will be crushed by the Eight Little Heavenly Kings. This is a sure thing!” The crowd bet heavily, few betting on Luo Tian’s win.

Who set up the bet? No one cared. But all knew whoever it was would flee if they lost, as most Reincarnation Sect disciples had bet. Finding the organizer was easy.

Whether they could afford it? They didn’t care. Even if they couldn’t, their family’s support would cover it. The Reincarnation Sect’s anger was too much for one family to bear.

Zhang Tiantian and Ye Chen were tense. All this was orchestrated by Zhang Tiantian and Ye Chen, watching disciples bet, even some elders. Zhang Tiantian trembled.

This was all per Luo Tian’s plan to strike big. The key was whether Luo Tian could defeat the Eight Little Heavenly Kings.

Victory meant vast resources; defeat would ruin Luo Tian, and Zhang Tiantian’s family too. Zhang Tiantian couldn’t help but be nervous—this was a life-or-death gamble.

Frenzy. Almost all Reincarnation Sect disciples were frenzied, betting heavily, waiting for Luo Tian to be crushed.

Time passed. Three days had finally ended. At the thirty-third level, tremors erupted.

From each of the eight central courtyards, figures soared skyward. They had previously competed subtly but now, for the first time, moved in unison toward the thirty-fourth level’s entrance. Those residing in the thirty-third level glared coldly, following the eight.

Chapter 2131: Motian

On the black platform, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, a smile on his face as he gazed at disciples with disdain.

Three days had seen disciples flood the ninety-ninth level. It was the first time the ninety-ninth level was so lively.

A crushing pressure descended as eight figures landed, their might overwhelming. They eyed Luo Tian coldly. Behind them stood the geniuses of the thirty-third level, thousands in number, their gazes cold.

“Everyone has arrived. The Eight Little Heavenly Kings!”

“Dark Night King, Hongye’s son Hong Tao!”

“God Ghost King Mo Du’s son, Motian…” The eight names were shouted, eyes ablaze with excitement.

“Such a gathering!” A soft voice rang out, sending shivers through listeners. Their gazes were drawn to the only female among the Eight Little Heavenly Kings.

Her fiery figure was undeniably alluring, her black robe unable to hide her perfect form. Her delicate features and glimpses of snow-white skin exuded irresistible allure, stirring the crowd’s blood.

“Zhou Ghost King Su Peng’s daughter, Su Dan. The only woman to inherit the next Heavenly King!” Eyes burned with desire as they gazed at Su Dan, feeling no chill but a surge of heat in their bellies.

“Demon!” Luo Tian opened his eyes, gazing at the eight. After a brief exchange, he stood.

“True Immortal Intermediate—this is manageable!” Luo Tian smiled, drawing Longyuan Sword.

“Will you come one by one or all at once?” Luo Tian showed no fear, his disdain barely concealed.

“You?!”

“The Eight Little Heavenly Kings coming here is already giving you face. How dare you, a backwoodsman, make us fight? I, Tian Dachun, can kill you!” A roar echoed. A figure soared from the ground to the platform.

Short hair, a black robe hiding explosive power. His face bore a sneer as he eyed Luo Tian.

“Tian Dachun, who withstood three hundred strikes against a True Immortal Intermediate. The top among the Eight Little Heavenly Kings!” Zhang Tiantian whispered to Luo Tian, relaying Tian Dachun’s info.

“Boom…” A black blade materialized in Tian Dachun’s hand, its dark aura surging. Without a word, he slashed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He raised his sword to meet the black blade. The collision echoed, sending both men back a few steps.

“Such strength? You dare challenge the Eight Little Heavenly Kings?” Tian Dachun suppressed his internal turbulence, eyes sneering.

“Indeed a backwoodsman. You don’t know how high the sky is!” The Eight Little Heavenly Kings also smiled.

“Yet he withstood Tian Dachun’s strike and held the upper hand. He deserves recruitment!” The eight mused internally.

“Luo Chen, little brother, you can’t beat me like this!” Su Dan’s eyes were sultry as she spoke, her gaze alluring Luo Tian.

“I’m not your little brother. This is just the beginning. I’ll grow stronger!” Luo Tian replied, his gaze invading Su Dan.

“Die!” Seeing Luo Tian’s eyes, Tian Dachun snarled. His killing intent transformed into a gust of wind, rushing toward Luo Tian. He raised his blade again.

Luo Tian continuously parried with his sword, clashing with Tian Dachun. The platform trembled under their blows.

“Fighting evenly with Tian Dachun—this rumor has about seventy percent truth!” Motian’s eyes flickered, his gaze dismissive.

The onlookers also sneered. Though Luo Tian’s strength was formidable, he only matched Tian Dachun—meaning he wasn’t the Eight Little Heavenly Kings’ match. After all, Tian Dachun was a subordinate of Su Dan, one level below the Eight Little Heavenly Kings. The latter had slain True Immortal Intermediate disciples.

“Excellent performance!” Zhang Tiantian and Ye Chen stood among the crowd. If they hadn’t known Luo Tian’s plan, they’d have believed he was evenly matched with Tian Dachun.

“Bet! I bet Luo Tian can’t withstand one Heavenly King!” Disciples placed heavy bets as they watched Luo Tian fight.

After an hour, Tian Dachun panted heavily, his body turning. He eyed Luo Tian, wiping blood from his lips.

“Spit…” Luo Tian bit his tongue, spitting blood. His face was pale.

“Enough!” Luo Tian mused, seeing the Eight Little Heavenly Kings’ sneer. He wiped his blood.

“End it!” Tian Dachun’s eyes bore frustration. He soared into the black sky, his aura radiating overwhelming might. His True Immortal power surged into the black blade.

“Boom…” The black blade’s aura exploded. Tian Dachun vanished, merging into the blade.

The black blade shattered the heavens, tearing through them. It expanded to a hundred feet, descending toward Luo Tian.

“Bazhun Blade—Tian Dachun’s ultimate technique. This strike decides the match!” Someone gasped, recognizing Tian Dachun’s skill.

“If he blocks it, his strength surpasses Tian Dachun!” The Eight Little Heavenly Kings’ eyes narrowed, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Finally some fun!” Luo Tian mused. His aura surged, his form blurring.

“Boom…” Longyuan Sword expanded, as if bursting its crimson scabbard. It transformed into a sword of creation but the crimson scabbard reduced its cold aura by four-tenths. Still, it radiated overwhelming might.

“Crack…” A thunderous collision echoed in the heavens. The crimson-sheathed sword cut through the black blade.

“Sword and body as one?” People realized, gazing at the sword cleaving through darkness.

Heavens churned. Thunder roared. The deafening sound made Reincarnation Sect disciples’ heads throb.

Next moment, the black blade shattered. It was cut through by the crimson sword.

“This sword!” People’s faces showed horror. They hadn’t expected it to cut through Tian Dachun’s mid-grade ghost artifact, even with the scabbard.

“Clang…” Tian Dachun’s figure appeared in sight, falling from the sky onto the platform. Two blades lay beside him.

“Boom…” The sword hovered, descending toward Tian Dachun.

“Tian Dachun is done!” Most faces showed admiration, pitying Tian Dachun. He hadn’t lost to a clash but to his weapon—because of the sword’s overwhelming strength.

“Luo Chen, little brother. Spare him!” As Longyuan Sword descended, Su Dan moved. Her white hand extended, black ghost energy forming a large hand to grasp the descending sword.

“Boom…” Su Dan exhaled, her True Immortal power forming a ghostly face. It devoured Tian Dachun, turning him into a breeze that vanished from the platform.

“Boom…” The ghost hand shattered, destroyed by Longyuan Sword. Longyuan returned to normal size. Luo Tian appeared in sight.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian spat blood, leaning on Longyuan. He gazed at the crowd before standing straight.

“Who dares fight me? Come forth if you have the guts!” Luo Tian roared, causing a commotion.

“Bloodied. If not for his sword, the outcome might have been different. His look suggests he’s crushed Tian Dachun!” People were speechless.

“Eight Little Heavenly Kings, dare to fight? Don’t send these underlings. Come and be trampled!” Luo Tian roared, his voice bold.

“Come forward! I bet I’ll win. Five million ghost crystals! I bet I can defeat all eight!” Luo Tian shouted, tossing his storage ring to a disciple collecting bets.

“Is he crazy? I must’ve misheard!” People gazed at Luo Tian, eyes filled with doubt.

“Not so. He must have a secret. If he entered the Reincarnation Sect, he wouldn’t be so foolish!” Some realized Luo Tian had a plan. How big it was, they didn’t know.

“Arrogant! I’ll see what secret you have. If it’s this sword, today you’ll be disappointed!” Motian finally couldn’t contain himself. He soared upward and flicked a storage ring to the bet collector.

“Just playing, two million ghost crystals!” Motian sneered, confidence in his voice.

“Come on. Fight! This is your last chance. Alternatively, submit to me and I might spare your life!” Motian’s voice was cold.

“Finally, a bold one?” Luo Tian gazed at Motian on the platform. Their eyes met; his gaze narrowed, sensing a threat.

“Those bets were trivial. Just playing around. I have another bet. Are you interested?” Luo Tian lightly tapped Longyuan Sword.

“Spit it out!” Motian sneered. He wanted to see what Luo Tian’s trick was.

Chapter 2132: Qiu Long

“Let me bet higher. Do you like this sword? I’ll bet it. Whoever defeats me gets this sword!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the group.

“Boom…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Longyuan Sword emitted waves. Luo Tian was surprised, a hint of joy in his eyes.

“It expresses discontent!” Luo Tian mused. He hadn’t expected Longyuan Sword to gain sentience so quickly.

“Don’t worry. These fools won’t win me!” Luo Tian lightly comforted Longyuan Sword, but the words were annoying to the eight.

“Whoever defeats me gets this sword!” Luo Tian turned, shouting at Motian and the others.

“Really?” Their eyes flickered. They gazed at Longyuan Sword, their gazes burning with desire.

Behind them were Heavenly Kings. Their eyes were different; they could sense Longyuan’s uniqueness, speculating but unsure.

“Good!” Motian roared, landing opposite Luo Tian. He addressed Luo Tian.

“I’ll do it!” Others also spoke, rushing onto the platform.

“Where were you before? Now that there’s profit, you all appear!” Motian’s face darkened.

“Luo Chen, little brother. Give me the sword. I’m yours. Give it to me?” Su Dan spoke, her sultry voice entering Luo Tian’s ears. Her invisible waves wrapped around him.

Su Dan stepped closer, her hips swaying, making men drool. She reached Luo Tian’s side.

“Am I beautiful? Give it to me, okay?” Su Dan spoke again, reaching for Luo Tian. Her breath was fragrant, making Luo Tian’s face dazed.

“Demon!” Luo Tian bit his tongue, regaining clarity. He grabbed Su Dan’s hand as she reached for him.

Her warm palm was caught by Luo Tian, surprising her. Yet she quickly pulled back.

“Luo Chen, little brother. You’re a naughty boy, taking advantage of your sister!” Su Dan laughed, retreating to safety.

“You all fight. I hate fighting!” Su Dan smiled, exiting the platform. She cast a flirtatious glance at Luo Tian, her allure overwhelming.

“Luo Chen, little brother. Remember to find me after defeating these Heavenly Kings. Let’s spar alone!” Su Dan spoke, her words explicit. The Reincarnation Sect disciples gazed at Luo Tian with jealousy.

Especially Su Dan’s flirtatious manner was unbearable. Some disciples had already bled from their noses.

“Hmm, okay. After defeating these Heavenly Kings, I’ll find you for a private spar!” Luo Tian gazed at Su Dan deeply. To others, it seemed like flirtation.

“Not easy to deal with,” Luo Tian sighed. Their seemingly flirtatious exchange had nearly ensnared him.

“Have you decided? Who goes first?” Luo Tian showed his boldness again, as if aided by beauty. He addressed the remaining seven.

“By the way, you must bet something too. What do you want?” Luo Tian gazed at the quarreling Motian group.

“Letting you live longer. You don’t cherish it, so we’ll have no choice! What do you want?” A burly man spoke. His body was strong, his eyes glaring at Luo Tian.

“Shan Gui Wang Qiu Shan’s son, Qiu Long!” Luo Tian instantly recognized the youth. Zhang Tiantian had previously explained the Eight Little Heavenly Kings to him.

“I want all your resources!” Luo Tian sneered, gazing at the seven.

“Who dares bet? Come forward!” Luo Tian swung his sword, its tip piercing the ground. His gaze was overwhelming.

“What’s his底气? Why did Su Dan suddenly withdraw?” The seven felt more puzzled.

“Only someone not ordinary could quickly recover from Su Dan’s seduction!” The seven mused internally.

“I withdraw. It’s a good thing for my Beast Ghost King clan that you’ve appeared,” a figure smiled, stepping back from the seven. It was Wang Gang, elder brother of Wang Lie.

“Who dares bet? Come forward quickly! Don’t waste my time. I have precious time, and I need to practice swordplay!” Luo Tian smiled.

“I’ll go!” As people discussed, Qiu Long finally couldn’t contain himself. He soared toward Luo Tian.

The remaining five didn’t move. They wanted to see what secret Luo Tian had, his audacity.

“Haha! Finally! The Reincarnation Sect hasn’t seen such excitement in a long time. Eight Heavenly Kings gathered!” As Qiu Long moved, figures appeared again, their aura formidable. The weakest was True Immortal Peak.

“Even True Immortal Peak elders are stirred!” People gasped, gazing at the figures. Some gave them a powerful pressure.

“Tsk tsk. There’s someone setting up bets. Come on, old man, I’ll play too!” An elder approached the disciple collecting bets, handing over a storage ring. It was Ma Elder, who had nearly been split by Chen Dao before.

Ma Elder bore resentment toward Chen Dao but dared not trouble him. He also feared Luo Tian, for Chen Dao had warned them before leaving.

Yet Ma Elder hadn’t expected Luo Tian to provoke the Eight Heavenly Kings’ authority. If they killed Luo Tian, Chen Dao couldn’t say anything. Even Du Tianming couldn’t.

Ma Elder and others knew the bet was orchestrated by Luo Tian, so they aimed to make him bankrupt, even destroy the Luo Clan. With Chen Dao’s warning, Ma Elder couldn’t act directly but this bet was legitimate.

If Luo Tian couldn’t pay the compensation, they’d incite the Reincarnation Sect disciples’ anger to destroy the Luo Clan. No one would object, so Ma Elder had invested everything—his ghost crystals and treasures.

Other True Immortal Peak elders also bet heavily, their smiles showing they were annoyed by Luo Tian’s chaos since entering the Reincarnation Sect.

“Unexpected gain!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. He gazed at the betting elders, then narrowed them as Qiu Long’s attack approached.

Black fists radiated divine light, like a hard stone, descending toward Luo Tian.

“Body combat?” Luo Tian smiled. He placed Longyuan Sword on his back, activating the Dragon-Phoenix Immortal Technique. He punched back.
