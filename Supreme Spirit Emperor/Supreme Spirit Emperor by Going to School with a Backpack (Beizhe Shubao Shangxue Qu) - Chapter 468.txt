Luo Tian paid little heed to it. His gaze then turned toward Zuo Qiuming, who lay there, and he assessed his condition. He found that Zuo Qiuming's state was already recovering swiftly.

"Luotian?" Just as Luo Tian had finished examining Zuo Qiuming, a cold voice echoed from outside the door. A young man pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The youth wore the attire of Danfeng, his presence as refined as jade. Upon entering the room, he scrutinized Luo Tian closely.

"Who are you?" The lack of courtesy from the other man greatly annoyed Luo Tian. However, he did not dwell on it—firstly, since he had just entered the Tianmen Sect, it was unwise to make too many enemies. Although Xuan Dan might not hold a grudge against him, the sect's disciples would not be as magnanimous. Secondly, the youth was at the intermediate stage of Tianxian, and Luo Tian had no confidence in confronting someone at that level.

"Feng Xuan Dan's disciple ordered me to take you to the outer sect!" After scrutinizing Luo Tian, the youth spoke coldly.

"Outer sect?" Upon hearing this, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly and gazed at the youth with confusion.

"If you don't wish to be your master's disciple, then your status is now outer sect! This place isn't where you should stay!" The youth spoke with a stern face.

"Ah..." Upon hearing the youth's words, Luo Tian's expression paused. The youth's reasoning was indeed sound. If one were to follow logic, he truly belonged to the outer sect now—after all, Zuo Qiuming had never recommended him for the inner sect. That is to say, Zuo Qiuming hadn't used that slot.

"Fine..." Luo Tian sighed in resignation. He knew this was likely Xuan Dan's scheme. He shook his head lightly; it didn't matter where he was. Luo Tian knew that his name had already become quite renowned, and if his friends were in the lower three realms, they might have heard of him by now.

Luo Tian rose and followed the youth out of the room. He then glanced around at his surroundings.

"Let's go!" The youth let out a cold snort and took flight, carrying Luo Tian into the sky toward the massive Dragon Tail of the Sky Dragon.

After crossing several towering peaks, the youth led Luo Tian to a mountain that was slightly shorter than the others.

"That's Zhao Ritian of Danfeng!" Before they even landed, a clamor arose from the ground. Some disciples at the Tian Dao level looked toward Luo Tian's companion with reverence.

"Listen, Zhao Ritian is not only a third-grade alchemist but also an intermediate Tianxian powerhouse. He ranks fourth on the Dragon Ranking!" People murmured, watching Luo Tian and the youth descend.

"Zhao Senior Brother!" As soon as they landed, many people bowed to the youth beside Luo Tian. After all, this was the outer sect; the Tianmen Sect's rules dictated that outer sect disciples should pay homage to inner sect disciples.

"Still a celebrity?" Luo Tian's face bore a faint smile, but he soon relaxed. Upon hearing the people's murmurs, Luo Tian learned the youth's name—a bold one: Zhao Ritian.

Zhao Ritian wore a cold expression. He merely nodded slightly at the others' flattery, leading Luo Tian past the respectful gazes toward a grand hall. Outside the hall stood a rotund middle-aged man who had been waiting there.

"What wind blew you here, Senior Brother Zhao?" The man was clearly a smooth operator. His eyes gleamed with amusement as he smiled, though he still addressed Zhao Ritian as Senior Brother despite being of a similar cultivation level.

"Due to certain reasons, he arrived late for outer sect registration. I've come to escort him in!" Zhao Ritian's face bore a faint smile.

The man was Zhu Yude, responsible for assigning outer sect disciples. All male outer sect disciples entering the Tianmen Sect were assigned by Zhu Yude. He was skilled at socializing and had long cultivated good relations with inner sect disciples, Zhao Ritian being one of them.

"Ah! So you're a friend of Senior Brother Zhao. Naturally, I'll take care of him. Rest assured, Senior Brother Zhao!" Zhu Yude's eyes lit up immediately. He wouldn't miss such an opportunity to curry favor with Zhao Ritian, already planning which lucrative positions he would assign.

"No need. Treat him as a regular outer sect disciple," Zhao Ritian cut in directly, then cast a deep glance at Zhu Yude.

"Someone has offended Zhao Ritian!" Zhu Yude had long honed his ability to read people's expressions. Otherwise, he wouldn't have maintained such good relations with inner sect disciples.

"Alright, the rest is up to you!" Zhao Ritian finished speaking and let out a cold snort before taking flight, vanishing from Luo Tian and Zhu Yude's sight.

"Hmph..." After Zhao Ritian left, Zhu Yude let out a cold snort. He crossed his arms and scrutinized Luo Tian for a moment before noticing something unusual about him—most new outer sect disciples were nervous, but this youth remained calm throughout.

"What's your name?" However, Zhu Yude didn't take it seriously. After all, this person had offended Zhao Ritian.

"Luo Tian..." Luo Tian spoke softly in response.

"Ah... Luo Tian. You... Luo Tian!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's reply, Zhu Yude's face changed instantly, his plump fingers pointing at Luo Tian in disbelief.

"Are you the three-time champion Luo Tian? The one Master Xuan Dan personally took as a disciple?" Zhu Yude seemed unable to believe it, asking again.

"Sort of," Luo Tian nodded lightly and awaited Zhu Yude's next words.

"My heavens..." Zhu Yude hadn't expected this young man to be the one so widely discussed in the Tianmen Sect.

Zhu Yude was stunned. After all, Luo Tian's fame had been overwhelming these days. If it were usual times, Zhu Yude would have treated him with great hospitality, for such a person's future was boundless. However, based on Zhao Ritian's words earlier, this Luo Tian had offended Zhao Ritian. Zhu Yude was now in a dilemma.

If he treated Luo Tian well, it might offend Zhao Ritian. If he made things difficult for Luo Tian, although he was currently an outer sect disciple, there was an 80% chance he would rise to great heights in the future.

"Senior Brother Zhu, how do you plan to accommodate me?" Luo Tian smiled slightly, sensing Zhu Yude's hesitation.

"This... Senior Brother Luo, I'll first take you to find a place to stay. I'll explain the outer sect's rules and then see if there's a suitable position for you!" Zhu Yude quickly regained his composure, smiling as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Thank you, Senior Brother Zhu!" Luo Tian smiled and didn't dwell on Zhu Yude's thoughts. He followed Zhu Yude to the outer sect disciples' living quarters.

"Senior Brother Luo, the outer sect has no special rules. As long as you complete your daily tasks, the rest of your time is yours to manage," Zhu Yude explained as they walked.

"Of course, your activities are limited to this mountain. Entering the inner sect's peaks without special permission is forbidden; unauthorized entry will result in severe punishment," Zhu Yude continued explaining the outer sect's rules.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded slightly, feeling that the outer sect suited him well—freedom.

"But Senior Brother Luo, Master Xuan Dan personally took you as a disciple. By rank, you should be far above Zhao Ritian. Why did you suddenly end up in the outer sect?" Zhu Yude asked casually, which was his greatest question.

"I'm not yet Master Xuan Dan's disciple. As for the reason, Senior Brother Zhu, I can't elaborate further," Luo Tian shook his head lightly.

"Ah, no problem!" Zhu Yude didn't press further. He secretly resolved to investigate why Luo Tian hadn't remained with Master Xuan Dan.

"Alright, Senior Brother Luo, you'll have to endure this for now. I'll find a suitable task later," Zhu Yude smiled and led Luo Tian to an empty courtyard. Though the courtyard was small, it was surrounded by other outer sect disciples' residences. Luo Tian wasn't picky; he nodded slightly.

"Senior Brother Luo, I'll leave you to settle in. When I find a suitable task, I'll come back for you!" Zhu Yude smiled and left the courtyard.

Luo Tian's courtyard had two rooms. He stepped into the one facing the entrance, tidied it briefly, and sat at the table with a contemplative expression.

"Why did Zhang Jinghuan suddenly try to kill me? His reason was too flimsy!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, pondering who he had offended in the Tianmen Sect.

"Xuesha, Zhu Fengtian!" Luo Tian quickly recalled two names he had nearly forgotten—Xuesha, the one he'd killed in the End Times Forest, and Zhu Fengtian, the brother of the one he had slain, Zhu Fenghuo.

"Could they have some connection with Zhang Jinghuan?" Luo Tian muttered quietly, sighing inwardly. He couldn't afford to be careless; after all, the opponent was a Grand Elder.

"However, he wouldn't dare attack me openly. Although Master Xuan Dan had relegated me to the outer sect, I still had Old Xue's protection," Luo Tian quickly sorted his thoughts.

"But a Grand Elder could easily kill an outer sect disciple. I must be cautious!" He then let out a bitter laugh.

"Strength is still insufficient!" His eyes then showed determination. Though he had survived a great ordeal, he had resolved to remember this grudge.

Meanwhile, Zhu Yude quickly returned to his quarters. A cold voice echoed in his ears, causing him to instinctively shiver.

Chapter 1813: Sky Dragon Cemetery

Three days passed without Luo Tian leaving his courtyard. He spent the time in solitude, cultivating and waiting for Zhu Yude to assign him an outer sect task.

That morning, Zhu Yude appeared at the entrance of Luo Tian's courtyard. His demeanor had changed from his initial enthusiasm, and he called out loudly while crossing his arms.

"Outer sect disciple Luo Tian, come out!" Zhu Yude's voice was unusually loud, causing the other outer sect disciples nearby to become curious.

"Is that Luo Tian, the one so widely discussed recently?" Some outer sect disciples stepped out of their courtyards with curiosity.

"Senior Master Zhu, what's your command?" Luo Tian smiled as he emerged from his courtyard, noticing the change in Zhu Yude's attitude.

"Still acting tough with me!" Zhu Yude inwardly sneered. Over the past few days, he had asked inner sect disciples to investigate and learned that Luo Tian had deliberately refused Master Xuan Dan's disciple status, angering the master.

Moreover, Zhu Yude discovered that Luo Tian had not only offended Zhao Ritian but also someone far more terrifying. The thought made him shiver.

"Your task is ready!" Zhu Yude let out a cold snort. To him, Luo Tian was now just a piece of meat he could manipulate at will. If Luo Tian resisted, he could easily accuse him of insubordination.

"Senior Master Zhu is truly remarkable. Even the renowned Luo Tian received no courtesy!" The outer sect disciples around him looked with admiration.

"Guard the Sky Dragon Cemetery. It's where our sect's ancestors rest. Don't make any mistakes!" Zhu Yude sneered and spoke to Luo Tian.

"What? Sky Dragon Cemetery?" Upon hearing this, the surrounding people were stunned. Their expressions were filled with disbelief.

"Has he finally made a move?" Luo Tian thought to himself. By the people's reactions, he knew the Sky Dragon Cemetery was no ordinary place.

"Senior Master Zhu is trying to kill Luo Tian!" The outer sect disciples murmured, feeling that Luo Tian had truly offended Zhu Yude.

"Follow me!" Zhu Yude ignored the disciples' murmurs. He was now in control of Luo Tian, and he could do as he pleased. If Luo Tian resisted, he could easily accuse him of insubordination.

"Alright," Luo Tian nodded. Though he heard the murmurs, he didn't take it seriously and instead felt a strong curiosity.

The two walked ahead. Zhu Yude's rotund figure led Luo Tian out of his courtyard and toward the back mountains.

Along the way, outer sect disciples who saw Zhu Yude's demeanor showed respect. They wondered why he was going to the back mountains.

After half an hour, the number of disciples on the path decreased. Though it was near noon and the sun shone brightly, Luo Tian could still feel a cold aura emanating from the distance.

After another half hour, there were no buildings left. Only a single path remained, with some weeds barely visible.

"Here!" Zhu Yude led Luo Tian to a small hut and shouted, "Zhang Hansheng, come out. Your time is up!"

"Crack..." The door of the dilapidated hut creaked open, and a thin young man emerged. His eyes were lifeless as he walked toward Luo Tian and Zhu Yude.

"You can go now. I'll assign you another task later," Zhu Yude looked at Zhang Hansheng with disdain. This man had offended an inner sect disciple, so Zhu Yude had assigned him here.

"Only a month has passed. This is better than the previous one who lasted longer," Zhu Yude sneered inwardly, looking at Luo Tian's expressionless face.

Upon hearing Zhu Yude's words, Zhang Hansheng's eyes regained their vitality. He then burst into tears without restraint.

"Thank you, Senior Master Zhu! Thank you!" Zhang Hansheng shouted and bowed repeatedly, as if bowing to a god.

"Go!" Zhu Yude enjoyed this high-and-mighty feeling. He waved his hand dismissively.

"Yes... yes..." Zhang Hansheng, relieved, hurriedly ran away from Luo Tian and Zhu Yude's sight.

"Alright. From now on, this is your territory. I'll remind you—don't go out at night!" Zhu Yude warned Luo Tian before rubbing his hands as if cold, swaying his fat buttocks and leaving.

"Let me check what's so special about this place," Luo Tian shook his head lightly and stepped into the hut. Outside, a forest stretched out, with graves scattered throughout it. Perhaps due to its age, the trees had grown tall, turning the graves into a forest that stretched endlessly and gave an eerie feeling.

"Nothing special," Luo Tian smiled slightly, gazing at the dilapidated hut. It was only colder than usual.

"Buzz..." As he spoke, Luo Tian formed a hand seal. The green Beast Summoning Seal hovered above his head, and the Howling Moon Wolf Net appeared before him.

"It's time to practice Beast Summoning Seal!" Luo Tian instinctively reached out to stroke the green fur on the back of his Howling Moon Wolf.

"Growl..." However, the Howling Moon Wolf growled lowly and stared at Luo Tian's back with bared fangs. Its fur stood on end, emitting a low growl.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian looked puzzled. He suddenly turned around but saw nothing behind him.

"Alright," Luo Tian turned back and soothed the Howling Moon Wolf. After a while, it calmed down, but its green eyes still glowed with hostility.

After soothing the Howling Moon Wolf, Luo Tian controlled the Beast Summoning Seal. The wolf exhaled green energy toward the seal.

"Ah?" However, Luo Tian noticed that the energy from the Howling Moon Wolf disappeared before reaching the seal.

"Is it because of the heavy yin energy?" Luo Tian muttered, then收回 the Beast Summoning Seal and speculated.

"The Beast Summoning Seal must be practiced at noon, relying on the supreme yang energy to combine with the beast's ferocity and form a Beast Seal. This place is a cemetery, so it blocks the yang energy, preventing the practice of the Beast Summoning Seal," Luo Tian sighed deeply and felt relieved. Since he couldn't practice the Beast Summoning Seal, he would have to rely on normal cultivation.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the broken bed and began circulating his technique. He didn't withdraw the Howling Moon Wolf, as this place was filled with sinister energy and he had to be cautious.

The Howling Moon Wolf's green eyes showed caution. It didn't lie down but stood before Luo Tian, gazing into the distance.

"However, the spiritual energy of this Sky Dragon Mountain is much denser than that of Longyin City. Cultivating up to the intermediate Tianxian stage is quite good!" Luo Tian chuckled and began focusing on his cultivation.

Time passed slowly. A day had gone by, and it was already midnight.

"Ugh..." The sound of wailing made Luo Tian open his eyes. He looked at the Howling Moon Wolf, who was now lying there with green eyes flashing a black glint. His eyes showed pain and struggle.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with purple light. He looked at the Howling Moon Wolf, who was in agony and saw a thread of black energy flowing through his body.

"Ghost energy!" Luo Tian immediately recognized the dark energy. His eyes narrowed slightly, and he reached out with his hand, emitting a suction force.

"Come out!" An invisible wave rose from Luo Tian's body. The Soul-Subduing Master and the Ghost Summoning Seal erupted simultaneously, and a thread of black energy flew out from the Howling Moon Wolf's body, captured by Luo Tian.

"Growl..." The next moment, a growl that only Luo Tian could hear echoed in his ears. It tried to break free from Luo Tian's grasp and roared at him.

"Interesting!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. Then, the Ghost Summoning Seal erupted, and the black energy that had struggled in Luo Tian's hand was completely refined.

"Let's begin. Since the yin energy here is heavy, it might elevate my Ghost Summoning Seal to an unexpected level!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with excitement. Although he couldn't practice the Beast Summoning Seal, his Ghost Summoning Seal could double its progress.

"Let's begin!" Thinking this, Luo Tian activated the Ghost Summoning Seal. The illusory Ghost Summoning Seal emitted waves.

As Luo Tian just activated the Ghost Summoning Seal, the entire Sky Dragon Cemetery erupted with howls. A wave of black energy rose from the ground and rushed toward Luo Tian's hut.

"Great..." Luo Tian looked at the thick ghost energy pouring into the Ghost Summoning Seal. The seal was changing rapidly.

"Growl..." A series of howls echoed from the depths of the cemetery, as if drawn by an immense force. One after another, figures wrapped in black energy rose from the ground and slowly approached Luo Tian's hut.

"What sound is that?" Luo Tian instinctively shivered, feeling a series of terrifying energies approaching his hut.

At the same time, all outer sect disciples in the Tianmen Sect heard the wailing sounds and woke up from their sleep.

Chapter 1814: Classic of Mountains and Seas

"What the hell is going on? What happened at the Sky Dragon Cemetery?" Everyone was puzzled. However, they all knew that the Sky Dragon Cemetery wasn't a good place and no one dared to investigate.

"Clang..." At this moment, Luo Tian's face was serious. He stood in the hut at the edge of the cemetery, which emitted a glowing aura. A barrier covered the hut, and the sound of collisions was transmitted into Luo Tian's ears. At the same time, thick black ghost energy poured into the hut.

"What is it?" Luo Tian felt his hair stand on end. The Howling Moon Wolf whimpered and tucked its tail, showing fear.

Luo Tian looked at the hut that seemed about to collapse. He calculated that his Ghost Summoning Seal was advancing so quickly for the first time. He estimated that it would be complete in three or four days, at which point he could control ghosts of the intermediate Tianxian stage.

"If my guess is correct, there are many ghosts in this Sky Dragon Cemetery!" Luo Tian's face showed excitement.

"Don't give up!" He then made a decision and focused on cultivating the Ghost Summoning Seal, regardless of what was outside.

Luo Tian was pleased that the hut, though dilapidated, was unusually sturdy. No matter how loud the outside noises were, they couldn't penetrate into the hut.

Time passed slowly. Two hours had gone by, and the noises outside became more intense. However, the intensity of the Ghost Summoning Seal's absorption had decreased.

"This is truly a treasure ground. Although it's not as good as before, it's still better than nothing!" Luo Tian looked at the black ghost energy that continued to pour in even after the Ghost Summoning Seal's time had passed. His excitement grew.

"Normally, I can only cultivate for one hour, but here it's two hours. And it hasn't stopped!" Luo Tian muttered quietly and looked at the ghosts still knocking on the door. He wanted to see what kind of creatures they were.

The more he thought, the more his mind felt like it was growing grass. After all, if he completed the Ghost Summoning Seal, those ghosts outside might be used by him in the future.

"The time for yin energy has passed. It should be okay now!" Luo Tian comforted himself and then controlled the Ghost Summoning Seal, slowly moving it toward the hut's entrance.

"Crack..." The golden barrier didn't harm Luo Tian. He pushed open the hut's door.

"Growl..." As soon as Luo Tian opened the door, a piercing scream echoed in his ears. Then, a black shadow rushed toward his face.

In the next moment, Luo Tian's body was covered in black energy. The dark energy instantly flowed into his body.

Luo Tian also saw the scene outside the hut: the entire world was dark. Several shadows surrounded the hut, constantly colliding with it.

The black figures were not more than a zhang in length. They weren't human-shaped, and Luo Tian had never seen such creatures before. Their bodies were surrounded by ghost energy, appearing as if they were phantoms with black teeth and eyes. They seemed to float on the ground.

Luo Tian immediately closed the door and returned to his room, as those strange ghosts had noticed him opening the door and rushed toward him.

"Clang..." As Luo Tian closed the door, a series of piercing howls echoed outside the room.

"Is it no wonder people go mad here? Being surrounded by these things for years, anyone would go mad!" Luo Tian muttered quietly. However, he then felt his spiritual energy was decreasing at a terrifying speed.

"Ah?" Luo Tian's eyes immediately became serious. Upon internal examination, he found that a thread of black energy was continuously devouring his spiritual energy and growing stronger.

"Come out!" Luo Tian shouted, and the Ghost Summoning Seal erupted with a strong wave. The pressure unique to the soul was also released.

"Growl..." The black figure immediately erupted with a desperate struggle. However, it seemed to be pulled out by an invisible force and was extracted from Luo Tian's body.

"This is truly a terrifying thing!" Luo Tian showed relief. In just a short time, his spiritual energy had been drained by half.

"If those few had entered, I would have been drained instantly!" Luo Tian wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and listened to the sounds outside, sighing at his boldness.

"Growl..." As Luo Tian was thinking, the black energy struggled in his hand. The black eyes of the ghost had suddenly burst into golden light.

"Sky Dragon Tomb!" Luo Tian felt the aura of the black ghost and exclaimed in surprise.

"Shi..." Seven-colored flames flew from Luo Tian's hands, forming a fire prison that surrounded the black ghost. He didn't intend to kill it; after all, this was a ghost of the early Tianxian stage. He planned to capture it with the Ghost Summoning Seal when it was complete.

"This hut is no ordinary place!" Then, Luo Tian looked at the seemingly dilapidated hut. It had a barrier that could withstand the ghosts' attacks, clearly not something simple.

Luo Tian carefully observed it and then noticed a broken book under the table. This was the only item with text he found in the hut.

Luo Tian took out the broken book, brushed off the dust, and opened it. His eyes immediately narrowed.

"Classic of Mountains and Seas, Ghosts Section..." The first page had these large characters. Then a strange creature appeared in the book, and its image was exactly like the ghost he had captured and those outside that were attacking.

"Ghost of Qi Consumption... Non-human ghosts, feeding on the qi of heaven and earth. They form in places with heavy yin energy. They can detect the scent of cultivators and especially like the qi of disciples... If infected, one will be drained within three days, dying as if aged!" Luo Tian looked at the description with a serious expression.

"So this thing is called a Ghost of Qi Consumption..." Luo Tian looked at the ghost in the fire prison and then flipped through more pages.

"Ghost of Corpse Consumption... Ghost of Speed..." One by one, the names of ghosts appeared in Luo Tian's vision. He continuously memorized these ghost names to use them if he encountered them in the future.

Time passed slowly. The dark sky finally receded, and the noises outside the hut became less intense. As the sky brightened, no more black energy came in from outside.

"In that case, my Ghost Summoning Seal will be complete tomorrow night!" Luo Tian looked at the green Ghost Summoning Seal above his head, eyes glowing with excitement. In just one night, the green seal had almost become solid.

"If I can complete it fully, then in this Tianmen Sect, I will be the master of the night! No one will be my match at night!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with excitement, imagining the scene of controlling countless ghosts.

That night was the most rewarding for Luo Tian. Not only did his Ghost Summoning Seal progress rapidly, but he also completely mastered the "Ghosts Section" of the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

"The greatest classic in the world!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration as he put away the broken book.

"The person who wrote this must be a great master!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly and then got up to cultivate.

In the following days, outer sect disciples often heard the sound of ghostly wails and howls from the direction of the Sky Dragon Cemetery, making them tremble. Especially between midnight and noon, it was extremely severe.

That morning, as Luo Tian just collected his Ghost Summoning Seal, Zhu Yude appeared at the entrance of Luo Tian's courtyard with a swaying gait.

"Son, have you been driven mad in seven days?" Zhu Yude's face showed a triumphant expression. He imagined Luo Tian begging him to transfer him elsewhere.

"Luo Tian..." Zhu Yude shouted into the courtyard, then kicked open the door and stepped inside.

"Ugh..." As Zhu Yude entered the courtyard, a cold wind blew across his face, causing him to shiver instantly. His pale skin raised goosebumps.

"Senior Master Zhu came! What's your business?" As Zhu Yude was stunned, Luo Tian smiled and walked out of the hut. He looked at Zhu Yude with a calm expression.

"Nothing?" Zhu Yude saw Luo Tian, who was lively and had no problems. His heart sank.

"I just came to check on you. I'm concerned about my junior brother!" Zhu Yude felt a strange aura from Luo Tian and spoke.

"How has your junior brother been?" Zhu Yude's face showed concern as he asked Luo Tian.

Upon hearing Zhu Yude's words, Luo Tian's mind stirred. He was worried that after finding out he had no problems, Zhu Yude would come up with another way to transfer him away from this treasure ground.

"Senior Master Zhu, what's in this cemetery? Why do things knock on the door at night and scare people to death?" Luo Tian's eyes immediately showed fear, as if he had seen something terrifying. His body trembled.

Luo Tian's acting was superb. Even though Zhu Yude could read people's expressions, he was still too inexperienced in front of Luo Tian.

"Son, I thought you weren't afraid!" Zhu Yude inwardly smiled. He then wore a serious expression: "Junior Brother Luo, I don't have any good places right now. Just endure it for a while. Remember my words—don't open the door, and there'll be no problem!"

"Senior Brother Zhu, this is a token of my gratitude. Please see if you can help me transfer to another place. If I stay here much longer, I'll go mad!" Luo Tian took out several vials and handed them to Zhu Yude. His eyes showed a pleading look.

Chapter 1815: Gu Qianxue's Purpose

Upon seeing the vials Luo Tian handed him, Zhu Yude's eyes lit up. He could sense the strong vitality within them.

"Rest assured, Junior Brother Luo. After all, you are a person brought by Senior Brother Zhao. I should take care of you!" Zhu Yude smiled and took the vials.

"As soon as there's a place, I'll transfer you!" Zhu Yude spoke confidently. In his heart, he had already decided to wait until Luo Tian went mad before giving an account to those who had asked him to do so.

"Alright, Junior Brother Luo. If you have no problems, you can go out and relax a bit!" Zhu Yude smiled and lightly patted Luo Tian's shoulder before leaving Luo Tian's courtyard.

"Hmph, my things aren't that easy to take. Consider it payment for renting the land!" Luo Tian's face bore a cold expression as he watched Zhu Yude leave, inwardly mocking him.

Luo Tian had made great progress these days. His Ghost Summoning Seal was now complete, not only capturing the first ghost of Qi Consumption but also over a dozen more.

Luo Tian's greatest joy was waiting for the night to fall, activating his Ghost Summoning Seal and capturing the ghosts drawn by it.

Time passed very充实. Luo Tian cultivated in the day, captured ghosts at night. Before long, seven days had passed.

During these seven days, Zhu Yude came once. Upon seeing Luo Tian's lifeless eyes and his body filled with ghost energy, Zhu Yude was satisfied and left.

"Buzz..." That night, Luo Tian continued to cultivate his Ghost Summoning Seal. At this point, the seal had become solid and was gradually turning black.

Over thirty dark figures hovered under the Ghost Summoning Seal, growling with intense eyes toward the half-black and half-green seal.

If someone saw this scene, they would be shocked. These thirty threads of black energy all carried the aura of a Tianxian stage.

"Distance to intermediate level still needs some time," Luo Tian shook his head lightly. At this moment, he could only maintain this state and avoid trouble with higher-level ghosts.

"Buzz..." That night, as Luo Tian was cultivating his Beast Summoning Seal, a wave of energy echoed outside the cemetery. A black figure rushed toward the cemetery, using the dark night to appear within dozens of zhang from Luo Tian's hut.

"Who?" Luo Tian, standing in the hut, immediately became tense. He thought it was someone who had offended him.

"Ah?" However, when Luo Tian extended his spiritual sense to feel the visitor's presence, his face slightly changed.

Dressed in black, she had perfect lines. Her eyes were calm and focused on the depths of the cemetery. The most shocking thing for Luo Tian was that those ghosts constantly rushing toward his hut seemed to have no awareness of her presence.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian was puzzled. The visitor wasn't anyone else but his wife, Gu Qianxue. However, she seemed to not recognize Luo Tian.

Luo Tian pointed his finger, and a ghost of Qi Consumption flew out from the hut. This ghost was now equivalent to Luo Tian's eyes, observing Gu Qianxue's every move.

Gu Qianxue showed a look of disdain. She glanced at Luo Tian's hut and then no longer paid attention, walking toward the depths of the Sky Dragon Cemetery in Luo Tian's stunned gaze.

"What is Qianxue doing?" Luo Tian's eyes showed contemplation. Although he wanted to see what Gu Qianxue was up to, the ghosts outside were too many. Even though his Ghost Summoning Seal had advanced to the early stage, he couldn't go out. If he did, it would be the endless ghosts welcoming him.

"However, Qianxue must have her own secret weapon!" Luo Tian watched Gu Qianxue disappear from his sight and ordered the ghost of Qi Consumption to follow her secretly.

Gu Qianxue's eyes showed a smile as she walked deeper into the cemetery. The ghosts of Qi Consumption at the early Tianxian stage didn't see her at all, rushing toward Luo Tian's hut. Strange-shaped ghosts flew past Gu Qianxue, and even those at the middle Tianxian stage didn't notice her presence.
