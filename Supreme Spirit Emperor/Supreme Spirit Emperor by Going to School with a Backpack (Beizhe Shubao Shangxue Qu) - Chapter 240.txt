“Indeed, the old master still has some tricks up his sleeve!” Zeng Tianshou's brows furrowed slightly as he waved his hand, summoning a gray long sword that sliced through the sky, completely sealing Li Cheng'en's escape route.

The gray sword pierced through the cosmos, as if cleaving the entire sky in two, leaving Luo Tian awestruck once more.

“Terrible! Another pseudo-epoch treasure!” Luo Tian observed the gray sword, confirming that even with the Epoch Bell protecting him, he would have been doomed in that single strike.

“Damn it!” Li Cheng'en was also startled, not expecting both Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang to possess pseudo-epoch treasures.

As the gray sword blocked his path, Li Cheng'en felt an overwhelming crisis—one that would truly end his life.

“Ah……” His white hair and beard fluttered wildly as Li Cheng'en descended into madness. Behind him loomed a purple gourd, and before him the gray sword radiated immense power capable of inflicting grievous wounds.

A golden sword materialized in Li Cheng'en's grasp, its light surging with thunderous energy as it slashed toward the gray sword.

“Crack……” The resounding clash echoed again, even from afar, Luo Tian was thrown into a fit of coughing blood.

In the next moment, the purple gourd absorbed celestial energy and was smacked by Zhou Zhengguang. The gourd shimmered with radiant starlight, spewing forth countless meteors that streaked toward Li Cheng'en with overwhelming might.

“Pf….” Li Cheng'en, already wounded, was no match for Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang even in a one-on-one fight. To face them both at once was sheer suicide.

Though he dodged several meteors, he was still struck, blood gushing from his mouth as his body cracked with a resounding sound.

“Still not dead!” Zeng Tianshou's gray sword returned, slicing through Li Cheng'en’s flesh.

Blood splattered everywhere as Li Cheng'en was bisected, his body scattered across the cosmos. Luo Tian exhaled a long breath, sensing Li Cheng'en’s fate was sealed.

“Ah… I die… you won’t live either!” The two halves of Li Cheng'en’s body converged, his disheveled form emerging before Luo Tian and the others.

“Old fool, show your tricks!” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang faced him with fearless expressions.

“I know I’m doomed, but even if I die today, I’ll take one of you with me!” Li Cheng'en’s face twisted with hatred, his voice brimming with endless resentment.

His life had only fifty years left, but after these battles, he was wounded again, hastening his demise. This injustice filled him with fury.

Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang’s faces darkened—though a late-stage Sage, if he fought desperately, they would have to be cautious. Otherwise, one misstep could see them killed by his final act.

A thunderous rumble echoed from Li Cheng'en’s body, and he held his pseudo-epoch treasure sword across his chest.

“Crack…” The golden sword was shattered by Li Cheng'en, splitting into five fragments that floated before him.

“Haha… die!” Li Cheng'en laughed maniacally, grabbing the five fragments and plunging them into his body.

His head, hands, and feet—five points in total—made him appear as if nailed to the void.

“Kill!” Seeing Li Cheng'en’s strange actions, Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang felt a bad premonition. They rushed forward, wielding the purple gourd and gray sword to crush him.

Ignoring them, Li Cheng'en spat a thunderbolt that struck his head, penetrating his body.

Suddenly, a silver lightning figure burst from Li Cheng'en’s flesh. At the same time, his body exploded into a blood mist, enveloping the silver figure.

“Blood-Red Thunder Curse!” The silver figure transformed into blood, resembling a vengeful spirit as it growled lowly.

“It’s the Blood-Red Thunder Curse of the Thunder Sect! Dammit!” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang’s faces paled, their movements halting mid-air.

“Stop it!” They both flashed with light, clearly wary of the Blood-Red Thunder Curse. Their hands formed seals to protect themselves.

“Blood-Red Thunder Curse?” Luo Tian stood ten thousand feet away, his face etched with confusion. Seeing Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang’s tension, he knew it was no good.

“Die…” The blood figure lunged toward Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang, but before it reached them, it vanished between their bodies.

“Hmph?” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang hesitated, but soon their brows furrowed as cold sweat formed on their foreheads.

“Luo Tian, run!” They shouted, then dashed toward Luo Tian like lightning.

Though Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang were fast, the blood figure was faster. As they moved, it appeared before Luo Tian instantly.

Luo Tian froze in shock, his heart leaping before he could even speak. A searing pain shot through his back, making him scream.

“Done…” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang’s faces turned pale, watching Luo Tian struck by the Blood-Red Thunder Curse. Despair filled their eyes.

“Dead for sure!” They both thought, their old bodies trembling slightly.

“The Blood-Red Thunder Curse—once hit, death is certain!” This was the explanation of the Thunder Domain for the curse. Even a peer would be annihilated by it. A late-stage Sage had unleashed this, its power beyond comprehension.

“Ah…” Luo Tian clutched his head, howling in agony as white smoke rose from his body and soul.

“Kid, hold on!” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang shouted mentally at Luo Tian, but hope was slim. The Blood-Red Thunder Curse of the Thunder Domain was infamous; they hadn’t expected Li Cheng'en to sacrifice himself, determined to kill Luo Tian even if it meant no rebirth.

At that moment, Luo Tian felt as though a thousand arrows pierced his heart, howling without thought of countering the crisis.

“Damn it! Once hit by the Blood-Red Thunder Curse, no one can interfere—only to be ground down by its power!” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang stood helpless, unable to act. If they did, they might end up sacrificing themselves too.

Luo Tian’s life force, his vibrant blood, and strong soul were being eroded at a terrifying speed. The sight of this despairing situation made Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang lose all hope.

“Suppress it!” Luo Tian regained a sliver of clarity, his face contorted as he roared. He thought of every method he could.

The thunderous sound echoed within Luo Tian’s body, sending a shocking aura across the cosmos.

“Damn it! Am I to die at this old dog’s hands?” Luo Tian raged mentally, but his body grew weaker with each breath.

“Epoch Book, your master is about to die!” Luo Tian channeled his last bit of spiritual awareness toward the Epoch Book.

“Buzz…” But the Epoch Book showed no reaction, leaving Luo Tian bitter and sighing at its unreliability.

“I don’t believe even the Dao can suppress me! You, a late-stage Sage, can’t kill me!” Luo Tian roared mentally, his eyes burning with madness.

“Dao! Suppress it!” Luo Tian seemed to recall something, his weak eyes glowing with determination.

“Epoch Book, you’re the boss—hope you’ll be reliable this time!” Luo Tian moved his hands slightly, trembling as he stood under the stars.

Chapter 1040: Misfortune and Fate

In the Four Sacred Star Domain, under the stars, Luo Tian’s face was twisted with rage. His features contorted as he panted heavily, his body at its weakest. Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang watched the white smoke rising from Luo Tian’s body, knowing he would be annihilated by the Blood-Red Thunder Curse within an hour. Their hearts were filled with anxiety.

“Cut him down!” Zeng Tianshou could no longer sit still. The gray sword hovered above Luo Tian’s head, its aura spreading as it slashed into his body toward the blood figure.

Though the gray sword was powerful, it was insufficient against the blood figure. Zeng Tianshou dared not use full strength for fear of harming Luo Tian, so he used only half his power to merely delay the blood figure. Within moments, it was completely consumed.

At the same time, a crimson lightning mark appeared on Zeng Tianshou’s forehead. He knew this was the cost of interfering. Once the blood figure killed Luo Tian, it would appear in his body, relentless and unyielding.

“Dao! Epoch Book!” With a moment to breathe, Luo Tian’s condition slightly improved; he no longer felt excruciating pain.

“Epoch Book, open!” Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with determination and madness. His recovered spiritual awareness surged toward the Epoch Book again.

This time, he wasn’t trying to use the Epoch Book to block the blood figure but instead sent his thoughts into it.

“Rustle…” As if Luo Tian’s command had worked, the Epoch Book finally radiated golden light, emitting an eerie aura.

In the next moment, Luo Tian’s back glowed with radiant light. A golden “罪” (sin) character appeared on his back, barely visible as if trying to break free from the Epoch Book’s seal.

“Haha… I wonder what will happen!” Luo Tian’s ghostly face wore a pale smile.

“Buzz…” As he spoke, the seal that had once suppressed the Dao slowly opened, its power gradually fading.

As if sensing Luo Tian’s thoughts, the seal stopped at a certain point, as if lifting a corner.

“Crack…” Luo Tian could no longer bear it; his back felt like carrying a mountain, and he collapsed.

Luo Tian had already been severely wounded. Now that the seal opened slightly, Dao power surged again, shaking him violently. His life was on the brink of death.

“What is this old man doing? At such a time, he still brings out Dao power to suppress himself!” Zhou Zhengguang’s aged face showed disbelief.

“He’s going to…” Zeng Tianshou’s eyes gleamed, looking at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Death-defying! Perhaps there is still hope!” Zeng Tianshou’s voice held a hint of surprise and awe.

“Destroy it! I want to see if Dao power can suppress this!” Luo Tian laughed, his voice broken but expectant.

“Using Dao power to suppress the Blood-Red Thunder Curse—this old man is truly a genius!” Zhou Zhengguang, though a late-stage Sage, showed admiration for Luo Tian’s move.

After all, this method was untested; if it failed, it would only hasten his death. But if successful, Luo Tian would gain everything—Li Cheng'en’s entire power, including his cultivation, body, and spiritual awareness.

“Buzz…” As if sensing the Dao’s threat, the blood figure moved within Luo Tian’s body but was drawn by an unseen force to his back.

Two opposing forces met on Luo Tian’s back, turning it into a battlefield where they devoured and suppressed each other.

Luo Tian smiled, knowing he had gambled correctly. He could think of no other way to destroy the blood figure.

“Success?” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang’s faces lit up with hope. Seeing Luo Tian’s ghostly form no longer fading, they knew he had truly succeeded.

“Now we’ll see whether the Dao’s will or Li Cheng'en’s Blood-Red Thunder Curse is stronger!” Zeng Tianshou’s face showed admiration.

Zhou Zhengguang was equally impressed. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to survive such a trap. Though they were late-stage Sages, they weren’t confident in surviving the Blood-Red Thunder Curse.

“Crack…” The sound of cracking and roaring echoed from Luo Tian’s back, drawing Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang’s attention.

They extended their hands, sending two streams of Sage power into Luo Tian’s body to mend his shattered flesh.

Luo Tian winced in pain; after all, the two forces on his back could easily kill him.

Though the blood figure was immensely powerful, it was no match for the Dao. They clashed on Luo Tian’s back, devouring and suppressing each other without yielding.

Luo Tian sat in the void, though still in pain, he felt much better than before. His face finally relaxed.

Silent battle raged on Luo Tian’s back for half a day until he opened his eyes under Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang’s joy.

“Mutual destruction?” Luo Tian smiled, having recovered his body with their help. Though his soul was overtaxed, it would recover after some rest.

At this moment, Luo Tian was half-naked, a faint “罪” character imprinted on his back. If observed closely, it seemed to be missing a stroke.

What pleased Luo Tian most was that the blood figure, though destroyed alongside the Dao power, left some remnants. This greatly boosted his cultivation.

“Breakthrough!” Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy. His hands moved swiftly in the air, creating golden seals that were imprinted on his back.

“Disappear!” Luo Tian roared, using the method taught by Gu Tianzu to briefly suppress the Dao’s power.

“Come!” Luo Tian extended his hand, and the cosmos suddenly erupted. The space around him became a black hole, absorbing vast amounts of energy from the stars.

“Fortuitous misfortune! Not only did the Dao’s suppression weaken slightly, but Li Cheng'en’s power remained in his body. This allowed Luo Tian to break through into the late-stage Sage!” Zeng Tianshou’s face showed admiration and a smile.

It was natural for Luo Tian to break through; he had been close to the late-stage Sage. With the brief suppression of the Dao and Li Cheng'en’s residual power, he smoothly advanced to the late-stage Sage.

Luo Tian radiated golden light, his blood and energy surging. Waves of sound echoed within him. Though his face was still pale, even Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang felt a pressure from his flesh.

“Reincarnation Body suppresses all bloodlines. Even at the late-stage Sage, it gives us a slight pressure. If it reaches the peak of the Sage, no one would dare to challenge it!” Zhou Zhengguang’s face showed anticipation as he spoke softly.

“Unfortunately, the Dao’s suppression greatly delayed Luo Tian’s progress toward the peak Sage. Without an opportunity, he might remain at the late-stage for his entire life,” Zeng Tianshou shook his head, his eyes showing regret.

“Using a peak Sage to suppress the Dao with the Blood-Red Thunder Curse is indeed a good method. But where would one find so many peak Sages? Even if there were, they wouldn’t possess the Blood-Red Thunder Curse!” Luo Tian shook his head and approached Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang, bowing to them. Without their help, Li Cheng'en could have crushed him with one hand.

“Take it slow. The road ahead is long. Who knows what great opportunities await you? This might be a test for you. If one day you truly become the Epoch Master, remember to give us some of your blood to prolong our lives!” Zeng Tianshou smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Thank you both for your help. Without it, I might have died, and the Four Sacred Star Domain would no longer exist!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, offering the last two sacred herbs to them.

“It’s our duty. After all, you are our old master’s old master. And Meng Yunxiao is stuck and can’t come out. We’re the ones who have to do the work!” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang pushed the herbs back. After all, Luo Tian needed them more for survival.

“Will sending you out harm the Ancient Palace?” Luo Tian asked, his voice heavy with concern. He had heard many powerful factions were eyeing the Ancient Palace.

“Don’t worry. Those factions underestimate it. Without the power of a late-stage Epoch Master, they can’t touch the Ancient Palace. Who do they think it belongs to? The power of an Epoch Master isn’t so easily obtained! Whoever goes there will die!” Zhou Zhengguang explained, his voice carrying disdain.

“Late-stage Epoch Master!” Luo Tian shook his head. In an era where even peak Sages were titans, a late-stage Epoch Master was like a god.

Chapter 1041: Calmness

In the Four Sacred Star Domain, under the stars, the black gate slowly opened. Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhengguang stepped through it, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight as they were transported back to the Ancient Palace.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his pale face showing a smile as he gazed at the familiar stars. The great battle had finally ended.

Luo Tian changed into clean clothes and slowly flew toward the Tianyuan Continent. Regardless, this battle had secured a victory for the Four Sacred Star Domain. The Thunder Sect suffered heavy losses and would likely not return to trouble the Four Sacred Star Domain soon. After all, a peak Sage had perished; anyone would think twice before attacking the Four Sacred Star Domain.

Luo Tian returned to the outskirts of the Tianyuan Continent, where everyone was tense and awaited his news. Yet they had already prepared for the wrath of a peak Sage.

Though Luo Tian was extraordinary, he was still at the early-stage Sage, far behind a peak Sage.

As Luo Tian appeared outside the Tianyuan Continent’s starscape, a massive formation instantly activated, connecting with surrounding continents and blocking Luo Tian outside.

“Indeed, the formation by Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan is formidable. Even a peak Sage would take time to break through!” Luo Tian muttered, observing the massive formation’s barrier.

“I’m back!” Luo Tian stood under the stars and shouted, his voice echoing across the Tianyuan Continent and surrounding continents.

No need for Luo Tian to shout; as soon as the formation activated, the people of the Five Elements Sect on the Tianyuan Continent sensed it. They watched a large curtain in the hall with tension.

“Luo Tian!” When people saw Luo Tian standing under the stars, they gasped in surprise, their faces filled with shock and joy.

“Luo Tian!” The armies of the Four Sacred Star Domain’s sects, preparing for battle, all roared, their eyes filled with fervor and admiration.

Previously, when Luo Tian chose to intercept Li Cheng'en, people thought he was doomed. But now, he had returned alive, indicating that Li Cheng'en had been defeated.

“Buzz…” The formation closed, and a group of figures rushed out from the Tianyuan Continent. In an instant, they were before Luo Tian.

Gǔ Qiānxuě, Lěng Qiūchán, and Jiāng Sīxī three women rushed toward Luo Tian as if forgetting they were in public. These three had endured the most, their hearts constantly worried.

Luo Tian opened his arms but hadn’t even reached them when two small figures darted out from the void, clinging to his body.

“Father!” Luoxiting and Luoli clung to Luo Tian’s arms, their voices filled with affection. Though young, they were well-behaved and knew their father might be in danger.

“Ha ha!” Luo Tian held his children close, a look of indulgence on his face. He glanced at the three women with apology.

“Hmph! You two get down!” The three women huffed, clearly jealous. They pulled the children away, making them upset and causing everyone to laugh, easing the tense atmosphere.

“Let’s go celebrate! From today on, our Four Sacred Star Domain will rise and stand firm in the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, his voice filled with excitement.

“Roar…” The people of the Tianyuan Continent roared, their eyes filled with excitement.

The Four Sacred Star Domain had long been looked down upon by other domains. After years of suppression, this battle with the Thunder Sect had finally made its people proud. Though they didn’t know how Luo Tian defeated that peak Sage, the result was what mattered. Today’s battle had made the Four Sacred Star Domain reappear in the Nine Domains’ eyes, earning people’s attention.

As cultivators, preparations were swift. Soon, the entire Tianyuan Continent was wrapped in joyous celebration.

Luo Tian and his friends clinked cups, clearly delighted. They celebrated for seven days before people gradually left the Tianyuan Continent, leaving only its native residents.

At this moment, Luo Tian wore a smile as his soul gradually healed. He held Luoxiting’s hand and cradled Luoli in his arms, walking through the streets of the Tianyuan Continent like a normal father and son.

“Father, I want to buy this… I want to buy that…” Luoxiting and Luoli’s faces glowed with happiness as they bought things constantly.

Luo Tian truly loved these moments, but he knew such days wouldn’t last long. Nan Gong Yuqing had gone to Tiger Fortress to retrieve the Elder, and soon would head for the Divine Beasts Domain.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian and his daughters strolled leisurely, a wave passed through the Tianyuan Continent. Golden light spread across it, enveloping the entire continent in golden radiance.

Luo Tian’s mind stirred with a smile; he knew this wave came from the Ancient Palace of the Divine Beasts Domain.

“Severe losses,” Luo Tian shook his head, ignoring the fleeting light and continuing to stroll with his children.

Though Luo Tian was leisurely, the Nine Domains were stunned by this golden light. The golden radiance didn’t just cover the Tianyuan Continent but also enveloped the entire Nine Domains for an instant.

“What’s going on?” The Nine Domains instantly became chaotic, people curious about what could illuminate the Nine Domains.

“Ah! It’s those major factions finding the Ancient Palace and attacking it!” Someone finally spoke, explaining the source of the golden light.

Soon, people’s attention turned to the Ancient Palace’s outcome. After all, the matter of Epoch Treasures was too significant; any faction that could obtain the Ancient Palace might disrupt the balance among major factions.

But soon, a shocking news spread: none of the dozens of peak Sages who attacked the Ancient Palace returned.

This news caused chaos in the Nine Domains, with major factions shocked and more astonished at the Ancient Palace’s strength.

The more shocking it was, the more determined major factions became to obtain it, as if addicted.

However, this matter soon calmed down. Though some still desired the Ancient Palace, clearly, peak Sages couldn’t seize an Epoch Master’s treasure.

Just as the Ancient Palace news faded, another event that captured people’s attention also reached a conclusion.

A million beasts of the Divine Beasts Domain crossed the void, led by three peak Sages. They attacked the Revenant Domain, and a massive battle erupted. In the end, the Divine Beasts Domain destroyed countless Revenant Continent lands with five hundred thousand beasts. Finally, the Revenant City, the core of the Revenant Domain, sent out a large number of strong warriors to clash with the Divine Beasts’ army. They eventually drove back the beasts from the Revenant Domain.

“Divine Beasts’ prince and sect leader, clean your heads and wait for the Revenant Domain’s assassins!” The Revenant Lord declared, clearly not ending here.

“Only the beginning! If you provoke us further, we’ll annihilate the Revenant Domain with all our strength!” Diao Yuanshan responded coldly.

Though both sides exchanged curses, they took no action. Their high-ranking officials knew this was just a minor skirmish; without revealing their true strength, it wasn’t real combat.

As people were still discussing whether the two domains’ battles would continue, another shocking news spread across the Nine Domains: the Thunder Domain attacked the Four Sacred Star Domain.

The Four Sacred Star Domain, though called a domain, was looked down upon by other domains. After all, it had no Sage-level cultivators before.

But after Luo Tian emerged from the Four Sacred Star Domain, people realized it had talent and was developing rapidly. However, most still focused on Luo Tian’s talent, not believing the Four Sacred Star Domain was strong.

When news spread that a million Thunder Domain troops and one peak Sage had all perished in the Four Sacred Star Domain, it caused a storm across the Nine Domains. People’s views of the Four Sacred Star Domain changed completely, and it returned to people’s attention with a million strong warriors and one peak Sage’s blood. No one dared to underestimate the Four Sacred Star Domain again.

The Thunder Domain fell silent; three peak Sages were now reduced to one, suffering heavy losses and damaging their foundation.

Plus, the Four Sacred Star Domain was close to the Fire Domain. At the Ancient Palace, it was clear they were allies. The two domains were now one team; their combined strength could now rival any major faction.

While people discussed the Four Sacred Star Domain, in the Tianyuan Continent’s Five Elements Sect, two figures appeared—Nan Gong Yuqing and Elder. They stood at the sect’s gate, their faces filled with admiration.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve progressed so quickly! With the Four Sacred Star Domain and Fire Domain as your support, I believe our chances of success when we return to the Demon Race will be greater!” The elder’s face showed excitement as he spoke.

Chapter 1042: Departure for the Divine Beasts Domain

In the Five Elements Sect of the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian stood in a room, kissing his three wives goodbye. He then went to Luoxiting and Luoli’s rooms. The two little ones were sound asleep, snoring softly even as Luo Tian arrived. He looked at them indulgently and rubbed their faces.

“Wait for me to return, I won’t leave again!” Luo Tian smiled at the sleeping two and vanished from the room.

Outside the Five Elements Sect, Nan Gong Yuqing and Elder stood still. Zheng Xin clutched his head, muttering something. Wan Lingkong seemed to argue with Zheng Xin, while Jiang Nanxuan stood by them with a smile.

“Hmph! Luo Tian’s always the last!” Wan Lingkong said impatiently, slouching.

“What do you know? It’s because they’re separating again! He had to spend time with his wives, right? You single dog don’t understand!” Zheng Xin smirked, looking at Wan Lingkong. Since he had found superiority over him before, Zheng Xin now constantly used the term “single dog.”

“Zheng Xin, wait for me!” Wan Lingkong’s face darkened. Seeing Zheng Xin’s annoying attitude, he almost wanted to slap him.

“Hit!” Nan Gong Yuqing also seemed annoyed by Zheng Xin’s chatter and clenched his fist, addressing Wan Lingkong.

“Nan Gong, you’re also… Ah…” Zheng Xin was about to speak when Wan Lingkong rushed forward and punched him in the chest. Meanwhile, Nan Gong Yuqing also lunged at him, with Zheng Xin’s cries echoing.

Luo Tian slowly stepped out of the Five Elements Sect and saw this scene, smiling slightly. He flew to Elder’s side with a respectful face.

“Elder, it’s been a while!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully. Elder had once helped him in Tiger Fortress and taught him the art of entering darkness and the Seven Demon Blades. His ability to fight beyond his level was closely tied to these two things.

“Haha, I didn’t expect you to grow so fast! You’ve reached the late-stage Sage. This is quite unexpected. Now, I might not be your match!” Elder smiled with a sigh, looking at Luo Tian and then at Nan Gong Yuqing with satisfaction.

“Late-stage Sage!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s face slightly changed, looking at Luo Tian. He hadn’t known about Luo Tian’s progress after confirming his safety and going to Tiger Fortress.

“Luo Tian, can you cultivate?” Wan Lingkong looked happy as he asked Luo Tian. If Luo Tian could cultivate, it would be a great blessing.

“No…” Luo Tian shook his head sorrowfully. Though the Dao’s suppression had weakened slightly, it was still like a drop of water in a cart—useless. It was better than before, but without an opportunity, even after cultivating for one or two thousand years, he could only reach the late-stage Sage.

“Congratulations on Elder entering the late-stage Sage!” Luo Tian sensed Elder’s cultivation and his face slightly changed. He hadn’t expected him to reach the late-stage Sage, which surprised him greatly.

“Haha, Elder was once a genius in the Demon Race! There’s nothing strange about it!” Nan Gong Yuqing explained Luo Tian’s confusion.

Luo Tian also secretly affirmed that Elder was indeed a prodigy. Simply creating the art of entering darkness showed his talent wasn’t simple.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian stopped Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong from fighting, standing beside Jiang Nanxuan.

Luo Tian was also surprised why Jiang Nanxuan would accompany him to the Divine Beasts Domain. He had always respected Jiang Nanxuan, and even though he was in the transcendental realm, Luo Tian wouldn’t underestimate him.

“Don’t look at me like that. I was dragged here by that guy!” Jiang Nanxuan sighed and shook his head, pointing at Wan Lingkong.

“Ah, it’s for fun! After all, Li Tianzhi and his group went to the Thunder Domain. What’s the point of us going alone?” Wan Lingkong chuckled.

“Hmph, you’re afraid the teleportation array might go wrong again!” Zheng Xin rubbed his bruised face and scoffed, exposing Wan Lingkong’s thoughts.

“Go to hell! Who am I? I’m the most talented array master in history! How could I lack confidence like this!” Wan Lingkong retorted defiantly.

“Then, Jiang Ge, don’t help him. Let him set it up himself. If he sends us astray, we’ll beat him to death! I really feel sorry for Xu Liyi. I don’t know where he was sent by you, and there’s been no news about him!” Zheng Xin sighed.
