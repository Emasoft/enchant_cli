“Master Gu!” Diao Dezhu and others exclaimed, their eyes alight with excitement, voices laced with reverence. Even Diao Dezhu, who was usually irreverent, now gazed upon him with profound respect.

Gu Tianshu, a human realm powerhouse, was regarded as invincible even during the era when Luo Tian became the Epoch Lord. He had repeatedly rescued the Tianyuan Sect and the human race from calamity.

“Where is my son?” A thunderous voice echoed, shaking the ears of all present. Beside Gu Tianshu stood a towering figure, his eyes blazing as he scanned the crowd.

“Father?” Amidst the fallen warriors, Chen Zhanbiao, wounded and sprawled on the ground, recognized the figure above. His eyes widened with confusion.

“Son!” The Barbarian King strode forward, his presence materializing beside Chen Zhanbiao in an instant. His eyes brimmed with emotion.

“Father, where have you been all this time…?” Chen Zhanbiao wept uncontrollably, his voice echoing like a child’s.

“I’m sorry for abandoning you!” The Barbarian King, moved to tears himself, bawled. Two old men clung to each other in a heart-wrenching embrace, leaving onlookers speechless.

“Master Gu!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with exhilaration as the white-cloaked swordsman, Gu Tianshu, approached him.

Luo Tian could sense the overwhelming auras of both Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King. Though he did not know why, he understood their ascension to peak power was inseparable from the Heavenly Court.

“Xuanyuan’s son and the heir of the Harmonious Voice Sect have entered the Heavenly Court. Thus, we’ve come out for a stroll!” Gu Tianshu addressed Luo Tian, his gaze sweeping over the remaining Hall Masters of苦神 and 平等.

“Rest for now; I’ll deal with them!” Gu Tianshu’s eyes narrowed, a glint of cold steel flashing. His foot pressed the sky, his voice resounding with unyielding authority.

“Son, who wounded you? I’ll avenge you!” The Barbarian King wiped his nose, spotting Chen Zhanbiao’s severed arm. He smudged his snot onto Diao Dezhu’s shoulder before bursting into a frenzy, charging at the 平等 Hall Master with a roar.

The Barbarian King’s massive frame, unaided by martial techniques, collided with the sky itself. The impact shattered the heavens, forcing the 平等 Hall Master to frown in grim determination.

“Equality for All!” The Hall Master bellowed, his aura surging as divine laws rippled. His power escalated, and with a crackling sound, his body expanded, radiating explosive strength. He met the Barbarian King’s raw might with a collision that sent shockwaves through the battlefield.

The clash of two peak Immortal Kings’ bodies reverberated with such force that it could cripple an Immortal King in the middle stage and kill one in the early stage.

The Barbarian King and the 平等 Hall Master staggered backward, both spitting blood. The Barbarian King’s gaze flickered with comprehension as he grasped the Hall Master’s technique.

“I won’t accept your heresy!” The Barbarian King roared, his aura surging again. He lunged at the Hall Master with relentless ferocity.

The battlefield trembled as two peak Immortal Kings clashed in the simplest manner, their collisions echoing like thunder.

“Fall back! Retreat!” Zhang Chenglong rallied the Tianyuan Sect members, retreating as the battlefield grew perilously close.

Luo Tian descended from the sky, his gaze meeting Gu Tianshu, who was already locked in combat with the 苦神 Hall Master.

Swordlight flashed as Gu Tianshu surged forward, his aura radiating invincibility. Each strike was fatal, unyielding and absolute. Though newly ascended to peak Immortal King status, he faced the 苦神 Hall Master without fear.

“Master Gu, you’re incredible!” Diao Dezhu and others marveled at the aerial clash between Gu Tianshu, the Supplementing Heaven Stone, and the Barbarian King against three peak Immortal Kings.

The heavens roared as storms swept across the realm, and soon, the void itself became chaotic. The violent fluctuations obscured the battlefield, rendering combat invisible to onlookers.

Luo Tian caught his breath, gazing at the exhausted members of the Tianyuan Sect. This battle had been grueling beyond measure.

“The Tianyuan Sect has two peak Immortal Kings?!” The Hell forces grew anxious, their conflict now at a life-or-death impasse. Four Hall Masters had emerged, and if they failed to subdue the Tianyuan Sect, their honor would be irreparably shattered.

“I said they’d all die!”
“After such a rare use of the Devil’s Body Shattering, I can’t waste it!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with cold determination as he surveyed the Hell forces. His gaze flicked to Tai Ping Hall Master, still recovering from his wounds.

Only Luo Tian and the Immortal Kings in the late stage could witness Gu Tianshu’s battle. He noticed Gu Tianshu now held the upper hand.

“Wait until Tai Ping Hall Master can’t hold back, then I’ll strike!” Luo Tian calculated in his mind, restoring his cultivation while fixating on Tai Ping Hall Master.

Time passed slowly. An hour elapsed, yet the sky remained chaotic. All could hear the Supplementing Heaven Stone’s cries and the relentless collisions. Blood rained from the heavens, splashing onto the earth to stir up clouds of dust. Even an Immortal Realm cultivator would be crushed by such blood.

“Kill!” Tai Ping Hall Master finally could not bear it, his face pale but his aura now stable.

A scream echoed as an arm fell from the sky, momentarily halting the battlefield. Gu Tianshu’s white robes were stained with blood, his sword dripping crimson as he locked eyes with the 苦神 Hall Master.

“Those who insult the Nine Realms shall perish!” His voice was cold and unyielding. The golden divine sword cleaved through the heavens, slicing toward the wounded 苦神 Hall Master.

The Hell forces erupted in chaos. Tai Ping Hall Master appeared beside the 苦神 Hall Master, intercepting Gu Tianshu’s assault.

“Invincible!”
“My grandfather, still my grandfather!” Diao Dezhu and Sun Ke nian laughed wildly, their eyes brimming with audacity.

Chapter 2724: Slain ()

“Amazing!” Zhang Chenglong and others marveled at Gu Tianshu, their awe deepened by his overwhelming strength.

“Hear that? He’s from the same era as Luo Tian. How did he ascend to peak status while you two are only in the middle stage?” Zhang Chenglong glared at Sun Ke nian and Si Ma Tuo, his expression one of disdain.

“You have the nerve to talk about us? You’ve been here for years longer, yet you’re only in the late stage!” Sun Ke nian and Si Ma Tuo retorted, making Zhang Chenglong flush with embarrassment.

“You’re the one who dug up graves and cursed your own luck, hence your slow cultivation!” Diao Dezhu interjected, shifting the group’s focus to himself.

“You’re a dog—what right do you have to talk about us?” Their banter lightened the Tianyuan Sect’s tense atmosphere.

“Enough. Pay your debts!” Luo Tian strode toward the Hell army, his every step resolute.

As Luo Tian approached, the Hell forces grew anxious. Though his power had diminished, he still stood at peak Immortal King level. Who among them could withstand him?

“Destroy the Tianyuan Sect! I said they’d all die!” His voice echoed coldly. Like a ghost, he appeared before an Immortal King in the late stage, his finger striking out.

The wind of his strike pierced through the opponent’s defenses. The Immortal King had no chance to resist, instinctively raising his hand. Two resounding cracks echoed as the opponent’s arm shattered, a bloodied wound appearing on his forehead. He collapsed, though not dead, severely wounded.

“Don’t let him kill like this! All of you attack!” A cry rang out, and the remaining Hell Immortal Kings leapt into action.

Three late-stage Immortal Kings, six middle-stage ones, and three Holy Sons converged on Luo Tian.

“You too? Come join the dance!” Luo Tian faced the four Hall Masters, his gaze sweeping over the remaining ones. Their hands were stained with the blood of Tianyuan Sect members.

Though those halls had withdrawn, their debt demanded repayment. To kill and flee was a mockery in Luo Tian’s eyes.

“Luo Tian…” Ye Qiu and others grimaced, now clearly seeing the Tianyuan Sect’s advantage.

“I’m not blind; I’ve seen how many you’ve killed!” Luo Tian coldly replied, his authority unshakable.

“The Tianyuan Sect isn’t something you can trample on!” His eyes burned crimson, recalling the agonized cries of Tianyuan Sect members—old, weak, women and children—all mercilessly slaughtered. This was unforgivable to him.

“Kill!” Luo Tian roared, his hand thrusting a spear toward the Holy Son of 苦神, Tian Baiguang. Tian Baiguang’s face contorted in fear as his surroundings seemed to freeze, leaving him no chance to resist. The black spear pierced his heart.

Coldness and terror enveloped Tian Baiguang, who struggled but found his strength drained. Neither body nor soul could resist.

His corpse fell from the sky, the Holy Son of 苦神 dead.

But it wasn’t over. Luo Tian’s next target was the newly appointed Holy Son of 黄天 Sect.

Yet as he moved, several powerful martial techniques surged toward him.

They were desperate—despite his depleted power, a peak Immortal King still posed an immense threat. Tian Baiguang’s death and the severe injury of the late-stage Immortal King were proof enough.

Dozens of techniques clashed, darkening the heavens. Yet Luo Tian’s face broke into a smile, one that sent shivers through the Hell forces.

He planted his foot on the ground, his demonic wings flaring to unleash a storm that swept toward the techniques. Luo Tian followed, his spear slicing through each technique as he closed in on the remaining foes.

Boom!

In an instant, Luo Tian became a god of death, piercing through the techniques and descending upon his foes.

“Retreat! All of you, retreat!” A cry echoed from the peak Immortal King battlefield, sending further panic through the Hell forces.

“Fearful? Even the Hall Masters are afraid!” The Hell forces wailed, their eyes wide with disbelief.

What status did the ten Hall Masters hold? Yet now they heard fear in their masters’ voices. Clearly, four of them had no confidence in subduing Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King.

The battlefield was obscured by blood, leaving the Hell forces in chaos.

“Retreat!” Ye Qiu barked, and the Fengdu Sect members began to flee. Yet Ye Qiu himself did not leave.

The other halls also started fleeing, and the Hell army descended into chaos.

“Kill! Don’t let these scum escape—now is the time for revenge!” Zhang Chenglong roared, his voice laced with satisfaction.

“Luo Tian, stop! Do you want them to die?” Wang Xiu barked, pushing out two people.

Plop!

Luo Tian pierced Cheng Ping’s abdomen with his spear, kicking him from the sky. Though not dead, he was near death.

Seeing Wang Xiu push out two people, Luo Tian and the Tianyuan Sect members halted. Their gazes fell on the two bound figures.

Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming, previously wounded and captured by the Hell forces, now served as their shield.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He couldn’t ignore their lives, his gaze flashing with danger: “What do you want?”

“Free us, and we’ll call it even!” Wang Xiu spoke, as the Hell forces began to retreat. A large number of people started heading toward Btian City.

“Free you?” Luo Tian sneered, causing Wang Xiu and the others to shiver. Their pressure was overwhelming, making them tighten their grip on Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming.

“If you don’t free them, they’ll die with you!” Wang Xiu panicked, knowing that without this move, Luo Tian wouldn’t let them live. The grudge was too deep; he clearly remembered the cries of the Tianyuan Sect members when he killed Li Tianzhi.

The standoff resumed, with both sides facing each other. Luo Tian pondered how to rescue Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming from their clutches, but the chances were slim. He was strong now, yet he had no confidence.

“The time for Devil’s Body Shattering has passed,” Luo Tian mused, his gaze turning to the sky.

As he looked toward the battlefield above, his lips curled into a smirk, mocking Wang Xiu and others. The golden divine sword erupted with ten thousand feet of radiance, cleaving through everything. Gu Tianshu’s long hair flew as he severed a great seal, and with it, the head of Tai Ping Hall Master soared into the air.

Chapter 2725: Fame ()

A severed head sent shivers through all, their eyes wide with terror as they gazed at Gu Tianshu, drenched in blood.

“Slain a Hall Master!” Their hearts clenched. The Ten Hell Hall Masters had stood for eons, their peak warriors reigning over the heavens. Never before had an Immortal King in the late stage been slain.

“The Tianyuan Sect’s people erupted with chaos. “Gu Tianshu will surely become renowned in the Immortal and Hell realms, surpassing even Luo Tian’s performance in this battle!”

Wang Xiu stared at the head falling to the ground, his grip on Xiang Tianming and Meng Wushuang nearly slipping. He was terrified beyond measure.

“One peak, slain in an instant!” At that moment, all thoughts centered on one name: Gu Tianshu.

“Grandpa! Grandpa! You’re my real grandpa, hahaha!” Diao Dezhu and others roared with delight. On the other side, the Barbarian King’s aura surged as he clashed with the 平等 Hall Master. Finally, it seemed he had surpassed a threshold. The 平等 Hall Master was sent flying by the collision, spitting blood as his bones cracked audibly.

“Equality for All?”
The Barbarian King, drenched in blood and pale-faced, glared at the Hall Master with disdain.

“Master, I can’t hold on!” The Supplementing Heaven Stone howled, his stone fragments constantly falling. Yet the 苦神 Hall Master’s face was grim, his hands trembling uncontrollably as he looked like a wreck.

The Supplementing Heaven Stone had always appeared on the brink of death, yet each clash forced him to fight with all his might. He had nearly been shattered several times.

The three Hall Masters gazed at Gu Tianshu, their minds reeling. They knew Tai Ping Hall Master’s strength; yet a newly ascended Immortal King had slain him.

“Retreat!” The three Hall Masters exchanged glances, their bodies vanishing as they ceased combat. They knew continuing would bring no good.

The three Hall Masters instantly appeared behind Wang Xiu and others, their hands sweeping to retrieve them. Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming fell into their grasp.

“If they die, we’ll storm the Ten Hell Hall Masters!” Gu Tianshu coldly spoke, holding Tai Ping Hall Master’s head. His gaze met the three Hall Masters, who felt their skin crawl.

“How could there be such a person in the world?”
“Why is he among the Tianyuan Sect!” The three mused, their minds baffled. They pushed Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming toward Luo Tian’s group.

Their speed was unparalleled; after pushing out the two, they tore through space and vanished.

Gu Tianshu extended his hand, ignoring the three who fled. He retrieved Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming, finding they were merely bound with no serious injuries. He handed them to Run Hongyu.

“Haha!” Laughter and cheers erupted on Tianyuan Mountain. The Tianyuan Sect members gazed at the direction of the retreating Hell forces, laughing through their tears.

“Father…”
“Brother!” A youth howled in grief, his voice heavy with sorrow.

Such cries echoed across the entire Tianyuan Mountain. This battle had been too grueling for the Tianyuan Sect; without Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King’s final intervention, it would have been destroyed.

All fell silent, gazing at the bloodstained Tianyuan Sect. This battle was a victory, yet it could be said there were no victors.

Li Tianzhi had died!
Tang Xinghuo, the Killing Life Elder—dead.
Chen Zhanbiao’s two elder brothers, Lu Chong’s two disciples—dead.
Everyone was wounded; many would never recover. This battle had been deeply painful for Luo Tian and the others.

“This debt must be repaid!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly. Though the Hell forces had also suffered heavy losses, he was a man of vengeance. Diao Dezhu and others were the same.

“First, rest; then plan revenge. This won’t end here!” Luo Tian spoke. The time for Devil’s Body Shattering had ended, and his eyes felt heavy. He fell from the sky toward the ground.

Gu Tianshu extended his hand, catching Luo Tian and bringing him to the earth.

“Today, no one does anything. Tomorrow, we rest. I promise—no one will dare provoke us again!” Gu Tianshu spoke with unyielding authority, lifting the spirits of the Tianyuan Sect members.

“Hang Tai Ping Hall Master’s head at our sect’s gate!” Gu Tianshu waved his hand, tossing the head to Diao Dezhu. He knew Diao Dezhu loved such tasks.

“Got it!” Diao Dezhu nodded, running to the Tianyuan Sect’s gate. He hung Tai Ping Hall Master’s head and corpse there.

The Tianyuan Sect members gazed at Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King with reverence. At that moment, they were deities to the sect.

The Tianyuan Sect fell into quietness. Night descended, yet cries of children still echoed.

The next morning, the Tianyuan Sect members stirred, beginning to clear corpses. This battle had nearly destroyed the entire sect.

But fortunately, Shenglong Sect and Sha Hai Wangcheng had joined the Tianyuan Sect, preventing it from being too empty-handed.

Corpses were cleared for five days before they were fully removed. Outside the Tianyuan Sect’s ten li, a massive pit was filled with corpses. Due to time constraints, the bodies had begun to stink; if not cleared promptly, a plague would spread.

“Burn them…” Flames ignited, consuming the mountain of corpses. The Tianyuan Sect members still bore hatred in their eyes, for among them were their loved ones and brothers.

In a dim room, Luo Tian stirred awake, his body aching. He opened his eyes and saw Gu Tianshu seated beside him.

“Master Gu!” Luo Tian rose, still feeling weak and was gently helped up by Gu Tianshu.

“No need for formalities!” Gu Tianshu spoke. Beside Luo Tian lay Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming, both severely wounded but still unconscious.

“Master Gu, are you returning to the Heavenly Court?” Luo Tian asked, gazing at Gu Tianshu.

“Yes, I must return. Though I’ve reached peak status, my responsibilities grow heavier. However, for the next while, I can stay here,” Gu Tianshu replied, his eyes complex. Luo Tian didn’t press further; he knew the Heavenly Court’s seals were crucial, and Gu Tianshu’s ascension to peak Immortal King had only加重 his burdens. Moreover, this peak status was surely tied to the Heavenly Court.

Chapter 2726: Collision ()

Over a million Hell forces, led by nine late-stage Immortal Kings, attacked the Tianyuan Sect. They suffered heavy losses—four late-stage Immortal Kings and two Holy Sons dead, with eight million troops fallen.

This news spread rapidly across the Hell realm and the Middle Three Realms, shaking all small factions.

“What strength does the Tianyuan Sect possess? It seems nearly the entire Hell realm has attacked it! How did they withstand it?”

Everyone discussed the Tianyuan Sect’s battle. Almost everyone knew that the Ten Hell Hall Masters had been humiliated.

“Did you hear? Luo Tian alone severely wounded a Hall Master!”
“That’s nothing! Tai Ping Hall Master was directly slain by Gu Tianshu!”
“Gu Tianshu! Immortal King peak, slaying Tai Ping Hall Master!”

When people spread the news of Tai Ping Hall Master’s death, it sparked a frenzy. Soon, many came to gaze at Tai Ping Hall Master’s corpse outside the Tianyuan Sect.

“Terrifying! The Tianyuan Sect definitely has the power to destroy two halls! No wonder it dared to establish itself as a sect!” The Hell forces raged. Tai Ping Hall Master’s death was monumental, potentially altering the Hell realm’s balance. Without an Immortal King peak, two halls couldn’t hold their ground—just like the previous Wheel Turning Hall, which had only one hall.

Even Tai Ping Hall was more difficult than the previous Wheel Turning Hall, as the Black and White Kings had briefly merged to reach peak status.

Time passed slowly. The Tianyuan Sect’s name was fully established, with Gu Tianshu, the Barbarian King, and Luo Tian’s names shining brightly. The sect now possessed the power to slay an Immortal King peak.

A month passed, and the Tianyuan Sect returned to order. Yet its only problem was a lack of people. Though some had joined, it still couldn’t make up for the shortage.

After this battle, Jiang Sxi directly declared that the Tianyuan Sect’s territory encompassed ten million li, including Btian City. Thus, people were needed to manage it. During this time, Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King guided Luo Tian and others briefly. There wasn’t much to guide—just helping them avoid some pitfalls. After all, they had already reached Immortal King status and each had their own path. Thus, the guidance was simple.

After a month of recovery, Luo Tian’s body still hadn’t fully recovered. He knew the aftereffects were too harsh; using Devil’s Body Shattering had nearly cost him his life.

After over a month of rest, the group emerged from their sorrow, though smiles were still absent.

In the grand hall, Luo Tian and others sat discussing the Tianyuan Sect’s affairs.

“Is there no one?”
“They’re probably afraid. The Hell realm has been repelled and wounded, but their strength remains. They fear retaliation!” Nan Gong Yuqing spoke.

“Indeed. In war, the Hell forces left behind vast resources in their storage rings—enough to elevate the Tianyuan Sect’s remaining members’ power by a level. Don’t be stingy!” Jiang Sxi spoke, gazing at everyone.

“Also, the array needs to be arranged. Increase the production of Divine Bow and the creation of elixirs. Luo Tian, don’t hoard your secrets—teach a few trustworthy people to boost the elixir masters’ training!” Jiang Sxi added, assigning tasks to everyone.

“Good.” Luo Tian nodded. He knew the Tianyuan Sect needed depth to flourish. The sect’s operation required comprehensive management, especially elixir masters. He used the remaining ghost pulse to place it under the Tianyuan Sect, making it no less than the major sects of the Immortal realm or the Ten Hell Hall Masters. In fact, it was stronger—since the Ten Hell Hall Masters had been extorted half of their ghost pulse by the Luo Sheng Gate.

Without the ghost pulse, Luo Tian’s Sinful Mirror had only six extinguishing lights left. However, now that he was in the late stage of Immortal King, unless there was a major surprise, he didn’t need the extinguishing lights.

Time passed another month. Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King’s auras dropped to late-stage Immortal King. They decided to leave.

“They descended into the Middle Three Realms with special means, and the toll was immense. They won’t return for a while.”
“Moreover, the Hell realm dare not come back. This time they were truly hurt. We’ve left marks; if anything happens, we’ll sense it immediately!” Before leaving, Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King spoke.

“Alright, you’ve all grown. If you have time, visit the Heavenly Court. You mentioned a sparrow; we’ll pay attention when we return!” Gu Tianshu addressed Luo Tian and others.

“Son, strive to cultivate. Future battles await you!” The Barbarian King advised Chen Zhanbiao.

“Hmph, hmph!” Though Chen Zhanbiao didn’t grasp the Barbarian King’s deep meaning, he nodded repeatedly.

“Have a child soon!”
“Hmph, hmph!” The two big men exchanged words.

“Go!” Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King stepped forward, ascending into the sky of the Tianyuan Sect toward the Fan Tian Sea.

But as they took their first steps, a terrifying pressure descended from the heavens, halting them. Their gazes turned to the sky.

This pressure exceeded peak Immortal King status—more accurately, it wasn’t pressure but a wave, as if to shatter the heavens.

“What’s happening?” A sense of crisis invaded Luo Tian and others’ minds, their faces grim.

“Is there anyone else daring to attack our Tianyuan Sect?” Diao Dezhu exclaimed, disbelieving. Who else would dare target the Tianyuan Sect?

Not only the Tianyuan Sect, but the entire Middle Three Realms felt this apocalyptic aura, shaking it.

“This feeling… is familiar!” Nan Gong Yuqing and others frowned, as if recalling the same sensation.

“Wait…”
“Activate the mountain-protecting array, Wan Lingkong! Hurry!”
“All Tianyuan Sect disciples, return to the sect immediately!” Nan Gong Yuqing seemed to recall something terrible and shouted at everyone.

Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King’s faces turned grave as they spoke to everyone: “Be careful. We’ll go out and see—two small realms are colliding with the Immortal realm!”

“Exactly. That’s how it was when the Demon Cloud City was hit by a small realm!” Nan Gong Yuqing shouted.

“What?!” Hearing Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King’s words, including Luo Tian, their faces changed.

Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King extended their hands, tearing into the void and vanishing from Luo Tian’s group.

“How could this be?” Everyone was puzzled, organizing the disciples and elders of the Tianyuan Sect to return.

An hour passed, and the sect’s disciples finally returned. Wan Lingkong quickly activated the arrays he had set up.

Boom! As the array rose, a thunderous roar echoed across the heavens, shaking the entire Middle Three Realms.

Chapter 2727: Nine Realms ()

The deafening sound shook the Middle Three Realms, causing the earth to tremble. The heavens cracked, and all beasts in the Middle Three Realms looked on with tension.

Not only the Middle Three Realms, but even the Upper Three Realms felt the tremors. Several peak Immortal Kings gazed at the heavens with grim expressions.

“It has begun…” Bu Tian, an Immortal King, gazed at the trembling heavens in the Upper Three Realms.

Crack!
Lightning rained from the heavens, striking the earth without rules, sweeping across the Middle Three Realms. Many people were struck by lightning due to their bad luck, some dying and others severely injured.

The heavens roared with terrifying fluctuations, sending more unfortunate souls into blood mist scattered across the ground.

It felt like the end of the world, and the people of the Middle Three Realms only knew about the collision between small realms and the Middle Three Realms. They were momentarily stunned.

At the Tianyuan Sect, Luo Tian and others stood within a barrier, gazing at the apocalyptic scene with awe.

“Far worse than before. When a small realm collided, it only devastated the Demon Cloud City severely; other areas were affected but not too seriously.” Nan Gong Yuqing spoke.

“Those two small realms will be in trouble!” Diao Dezhu said, lamenting that many would die in this collision.

“Why is this happening?” Luo Tian was also puzzled, sensing something suspicious about the small realms colliding with the Immortal realm.

Boom boom boom…
The thunderous roars echoed across the heavens, and cries of alarm spread throughout the Middle Three Realms.

In the star domain beyond the Immortal realm, Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King stood. Their auras had inexplicably returned to peak Immortal King status.

“What is this!” Their faces turned pale as they gazed at the drifting two star clouds.

The two star clouds hadn’t collided with the Middle Three Realms yet, but they already brought immense pressure.

“Those are the Nine Realms!” Gu Tianshu’s eyes widened, staring at the two star clouds. Though they were connected, their familiar aura still let him recognize them.

“Damn!” Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King’s faces darkened, sensing the severity of the situation. They stepped into space toward the two star clouds.

At that moment, those in the two star realms didn’t feel a crisis about to descend upon them.

The Nine Realms, after Luo Tian and others ascended, the Tianyuan Continent had ruled over the Nine Realms. For millions of years, the Nine Realms had undergone changes.

Especially a million years ago, one star realm suddenly collided with the Nine Realms. That collision had caused heavy casualties in both the Nine Realms and the Yongyang Realm.

After time passed, two star realms waged war, unaware that as they moved toward the Immortal realm, their rules had changed.

After the war, two star realms gradually stabilized, entering a brief peace. Yet their people still fought occasionally at the top levels.

At the border of two star realms, two groups faced each other—this was their battlefield, where daily confrontations occurred.

Boom!
The apocalypse arrived as the outermost continents of the two star realms collided with the Middle Three Realms. The opposing groups were instantly shattered into blood mist.

Crash!
Stone fragments flew, and massive continents in the Middle Three Realms were shattered. Even if they reached space, they would be annihilated by the void currents.

“What’s happening!” As the outermost continents began to disintegrate, people of the Nine Realms and Yongyang Realm erupted in chaos. The collision’s fluctuations made their minds tremble.

On the Tianyuan Continent, powerful figures appeared outside the star realm, gazing into its depths. Even they couldn’t see the scene of continents disintegrating.

At the same time, Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King appeared in the Nine Realms. Their strength was peak Immortal King, but even the Nine Realms’ rules couldn’t withstand their collision.

“Come!” Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King didn’t have time to explain, instantly appearing before the Tianyuan Continent. The people of the Tianyuan Continent felt their vision go black, unable to recognize who had arrived.

Boom boom boom…
A massive vortex formed around Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King.

Stars converged toward them, and people on the continents felt their feet tremble.

Boom boom boom…
The thunderous roars echoed, and hundreds of inhabited continents gathered before Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King.

They waved their hands, drawing in figures, but even with their strength, they couldn’t stop the Nine Realms and Yongyang Realm from colliding. They could only minimize casualties.

As they fought, continents still collided with the Immortal realm, and billions of lives were annihilated. Bloodstained air spread through the star realms.

Compared to the Middle Three Realms, the realm beyond the star domains was truly apocalyptic. People didn’t even know what had happened before being erased without a trace.

“Roar!” Gu Tianshu and the Barbarian King roared, continuously gathering people. But compared to the Nine Realms, it was like a drop in the ocean; more and more continents’ people were annihilated.

In the Nine Realms’ desolate region, in a cave of gods and demons, several young figures were exploring. But suddenly, they were swept up by a devastating force.

“Luo Li, hurry through the void!” A woman cried, her voice laced with urgency.

Luo Li didn’t hesitate, quickly gathering them and vanishing into the void.

But as soon as they entered the void, a terrifying void blade flew toward Luo Li’s side. His face darkened as he felt this void blade could wound him, even if his body was of the Void Path.

Plop!
Blood spewed from Luo Li’s shoulder, splashing onto the ground as he gasped.

“What happened!” Luo Li’s eyes widened in horror, feeling this void was different from any he had entered before.
