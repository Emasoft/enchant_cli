“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!” Four voices of death and destruction echoed from the four directions of the Chaos Continent, spreading across the starry expanse of the Chaos Domain. A host of formidable figures surged toward the people of the Chaos Domain, their killing intent vast and overwhelming.

“Elder Brother!” Zhu Ge Huangchao trembled, his heart pounding as he watched the flood of warriors from all four directions descending upon them. His eyes reflected terror—only now did he regret his actions.

“Kill!” Zhu Ge Jie sighed longingly, knowing that once the two factions clashed, there would be no room for negotiation.

“Impossible to resist!” Zhu Ge Jie observed the three Epoch Treasures behind Luo Tian’s group, along with the Void Warship and the Yin-Yang Twin Fish. The震慑 of the Epoch Treasure, the Chaos Bell, was nearly insurmountable.

“Must we truly unleash all of the Chaos Domain’s strength?” Zhu Ge Jie turned his gaze toward the Chaos Holy Palace atop the continent, his eyes flickering with madness.

“Kill!” He cast aside all thoughts and charged toward Luo Tian, his eyes cold.

In an instant, Luo Tian and Zhu Ge Jie collided. The impact sent shockwaves through the cosmos, wild energy radiating from their bodies. Simultaneously, the four sacred star domains—Sacrificial Star Domain, Demon Realm, Flame Domain, and the Demon Race—rushed into battle with the Chaos Domain’s warriors.

Crushing, absolute crushing. No surprises—immediately after contact, countless Chaos Domain warriors fell, unable to withstand the combined assault of four sanctuaries.

“Zhu Ge Jie! Will you comply or not!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with mockery, clashing repeatedly with Zhu Ge Jie. His current power was beyond comprehension; his cultivation had matched Zhu Ge Jie and Sun Miechen. In the early Epoch, he had once fought Zhu Ge Jie to mutual exhaustion. Now, with his cultivation breakthroughs, he seemed to have returned to the era when he had dominated his peers.

With two supreme arts at their disposal, Luo Tian’s power was unparalleled. Each clash with Zhu Ge Jie sent tremors through his mind, leaving him weakened.

“Ah…” Yet Zhu Ge Jie was one of the Nine Great Body Types; though not as formidable as the Reincarnation Body, he was still peerless. Each strike of his left Luo Tian on high alert.

The battlefield, aside from Luo Tian’s struggle against Zhu Ge Jie, saw no pressure elsewhere. Though the four factions suffered losses, they were leagues ahead of the Chaos Domain’s forces—pure slaughter.

Long Jie clashed with Zhu Ge Huangchao, his power now immense. No longer the naive youth of old, Long Jie bore the aura of a sovereign after years at the helm of the Demon Realm. Each strike sent Zhu Ge Huangchao spewing blood, and it was only a matter of time before he crushed him.

“Back then, you were arrogant, even replacing your brother to subdue all enemies. How dare you!” Long Jie sneered, his imperial dragon qi infused with Epoch power. Each palm strike landed on Zhu Ge Huangchao’s body, and he taunted him relentlessly.

Long Jie had long resented Zhu Ge Huangchao’s arrogance toward Luo Tian in the past. Yet at that time, Long Jie had not yet matured, and Luo Tian had prevented him from acting. Now, with the chance to confront Zhu Ge Huangchao, Long Jie would not let him escape.

“Ah… I’ll fight you to the death!” Zhu Ge Huangchao roared, his eyes blazing with fury as he lunged at Long Jie.

Others found their opponents too, but the Chaos Domain’s elite forces were still far inferior to Luo Tian’s group. Many ended up fighting one against three.

Master Xuanbing was unstoppable; each strike froze vast numbers of Chaos Domain warriors, none able to withstand his Epoch Peak might. The Chaos Domain’s people were but ants before him.

Another terrifying figure was Gu Lei, whose toxic arts had reached perfection. Now, he thrived in such a battlefield, his rate of exterminating enemies rivaling even Xuanbing’s.

The air reeked of blood and brutality, spreading to the other domains. The nine domains were stunned by Luo Tian’s actions.

Sacrificial Sanctuaries had existed since ancient times, and no sanctuary dared to clash with another unless the Epoch Lord intervened. Luo Tian’s group had achieved what was unprecedented in nine-domain history.

“Attacking a sanctuary—Chaos Domain, no less! My heavens, truly worthy of Luo Tian. How long has it been since he stirred such a storm!” All murmured in awe, their gazes filled with reverence toward the Chaos Domain.

Meanwhile, other sanctuaries watched anxiously. The power Luo Tian’s group displayed had exceeded their expectations—truly capable of annihilating a sanctuary.

Previously, destroying the Phoenix Clan had seemed trivial; though formidable, they could have done it with sacrifice. But Chaos Domain’s Chaos Holy Palace was different—it stood as an equal, the pillar of a domain.

Cries of battle and rivers of blood flowed as the four factions—Sacrificial Star Domain, Demon Race, Demon Realm, and Flame Domain—became a meat grinder, mercilessly slaughtering Chaos Domain warriors.

“Ah…” Zhu Ge Jie’s face twisted with madness, especially as he watched Zhu Ge Huangchao teetering on death beneath Long Jie’s blows. His heart felt like it bled.

“Chaos Bell!” Zhu Ge Jie knew he had to unleash the bell or risk losing all chance. Though Luo Tian’s group possessed three Epoch Treasures, their collision would also harm the four factions—this might make Luo Tian’s group wary.

“Dong…” Zhu Ge Huangchao was repelled by Luo Tian, then soared into the air, appearing beneath the Chaos Bell. His eyes were fierce.

“Then let us perish together!” Zhu Ge Huangchao bit his finger, and gray blood flew from it. He etched complex seals onto the Chaos Bell.

“Everyone, return to the Void Warship!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed as he barked at his group. He leapt toward the Ancient Heaven Palace, activating its thunderous roar.

A radiant aura enveloped vast numbers of the four factions’ warriors, their eyes cold.

The light of the Ultimate Path descended, as if drawn by an unseen force. The Demon Emperor Mirror was activated by Long Jie, radiating intense heat. It hurtled toward the Chaos Bell with apocalyptic power.

Wherever the light reached, stars shattered, as if erased from existence. The remaining Chaos Domain warriors gaped in terror.

“Dong…” The bell’s sound echoed, shaking the star domains. Invisible waves of destruction surged toward the light from the Demon Emperor Mirror.

A black demon sword severed space, a supreme blade slicing downward, leaving ruin in its wake.

Three terrifying waves collided, seemingly slow but instantly clashing.

The entire cosmos seemed to freeze. Luo Tian and his group stood within the Ancient Heaven Palace’s protective barrier, their faces pale.

The massive Void Warship trembled violently; its crew spat blood, fear in their eyes.

This was annihilation.

The collision of three Epoch Treasures devastated the cosmos, wild energy spreading across the Chaos Continent. The area around the treasures became a vacuum.

Only the Void Warship, Yin-Yang Twin Fish, and Ancient Heaven Palace hovered in the gray void. The Chaos Continent had been annihilated, leaving only a single gray mountain suspended there—the foundation of the Chaos Domain. This was where the Chaos Lord had forged a mountain with supreme methods, and it housed the Chaos Holy Palace.

Terror spread across the gray mountain as surviving Chaos Domain warriors gazed in fear at the three Epoch Treasures still locked in confrontation.

Yet, the Demon Emperor Mirror and the Ultimate Path Sword seemed to suppress the Chaos Bell, leaving the Chaos Domain’s people despairing.

“Luo Tian, are you truly determined to fight to the death!” Zhu Ge Jie stood pale as a sheet, gazing at the vast Chaos Continent and its dwindling people. His heart bled.

“You forced me to this! Now I give you one last chance—surrender, or the Chaos Domain will be destroyed!” Luo Tian stood beneath the Ancient Heaven Palace, his voice cold. They now held absolute advantage.

Chapter 1432: Sacred Domain Arrives ()

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhu Ge Jie’s face darkened. Their losses were severe; continuing would risk annihilation.

“Don’t force me to unleash the Chaos Domain’s true secret!” Zhu Ge Jie spoke gravely, his voice near madness.

“Open or not?” Luo Tian ignored Zhu Ge Jie’s words. Though he knew the Chaos Domain might still have secrets, he no longer cared. His sole goal was to find Yuan Ci Immortal Light and rescue Ming Huan, then destroy him.

“Open!” As Zhu Ge Jie hesitated, an old man emerged from the gray mountain. His face was stern as he stepped forward, radiating the aura of an Epoch Late Period cultivator. The Chaos Domain’s people bowed respectfully.

“Old Lord of the Chaos Domain!” They gazed with reverence, bowing to him.

“Zhu Ge Chaos?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. He had long sought Zhu Ge Chaos’s presence, yet he appeared now.

“Epoch Late Period?” Luo Tian sensed Zhu Ge Chaos’s cultivation, nodding inwardly. Though the younger generation now dominated the nine domains, figures like Zhu Ge Chaos and Diao Yuanshan still advanced quietly. They had retreated to the shadows, becoming the hidden foundations of their respective sacred clans.

Luo Tian knew Diao Yuanshan had reached Epoch Late Period, currently clashing with Epoch Peak in the Dragon Tomb. He had visited him before but learned Diao Yuanshan had secluded himself after returning to the Demon Realm.

Back when Diao Yuanshan was in Epoch Early Period, Zhu Ge Chaos had been at the brink of Epoch. Yet over the years, he had surpassed Diao Yuanshan’s cultivation.

“Luo Tian!” Zhu Ge Chaos smiled faintly, a touch of bitterness in his gaze as he nodded to Luo Tian.

Though Zhu Ge Chaos’s power was trivial compared to Luo Tian, an Epoch Late Period cultivator could not change the situation. Even Xuanbing alone could crush any Epoch Late Period.

Yet Zhu Ge Chaos was a veteran, one of the few with equal prestige to Diao Yuanshan, Sun Shengtian, and Yan Xiuluo.

“Lord of the Chaos Domain!” Luo Tian bowed slightly to Zhu Ge Chaos, showing respect.

“This matter should end! Continuing will mean mutual destruction. My Chaos Domain’s secret will cost you dearly!” Zhu Ge Chaos spoke, his gaze sweeping over Zhu Ge Jie and the remaining Chaos Domain warriors. He sighed deeply.

“Unexpectedly, I merely closed my eyes and this happened!” Zhu Ge Chaos looked at Zhu Ge Jie, disappointment in his gaze.

“From now on, Zhu Ge Jie is dismissed as the Supreme Palace Master of Chaos Holy Palace!” Zhu Ge Chaos’s gaze held authority, his presence exuding pressure from years as the domain’s ruler. Even Zhu Ge Jie could not match it.

“Yes!” Zhu Ge Jie, who dared to be arrogant toward others, now appeared deferential before Zhu Ge Chaos. He dared not object.

“As for the Chaos Abyss, we opened it every century. But since you’ve spoken, I’ll grant this favor—despite your past contributions to the nine domains.”

“Opening the Chaos Abyss requires a heavy price. Even my Chaos Domain finds it hard to bear. As compensation, we’ll pay the cost!” Zhu Ge Chaos spoke again, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Old Lord!” The Chaos Domain’s people grimaced at Zhu Ge Chaos’s words, surprised he was so generous.

Their refusal to yield stemmed largely from not wanting to tarnish the Chaos Domain’s reputation. A small part was their reluctance to pay such a heavy price for an early opening of the Chaos Abyss.

Yet now, Zhu Ge Chaos had agreed outright, changing their view of him. Was this the same fierce old lord they once knew?

“Are you satisfied?” Zhu Ge Chaos gazed at Luo Tian, a faint smile on his face, ignoring the Chaos Domain’s glares.

“Old fox!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, his brow furrowed. The Chaos Domain was indeed a tough nut to crack. Though they had crushed them, Luo Tian was confident he could annihilate the Chaos Domain’s people now.

But with the Chaos Bell, Zhu Ge Jie had a chance to escape—like Ming Huan. If he escaped, he’d surely sabotage the Sacrificial Star Domain in secret. Luo Tian couldn’t ignore such a threat.

“Wu…” Before Luo Tian could speak, Zhu Ge Chaos waved his hand, and a gray altar appeared.

A youth cloaked in gray mist sat upon it, eyes closed, radiating immense power. Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed.

“This is the disciple of the Chaos Lord who founded the Chaos Domain!” Zhu Ge Chaos’s gaze held reverence as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, sensing the same aura on this youth as on Zhong Zixuan and Ming Huan.

“After some time, we’ll awaken him! I assume you’d grant the disciple of the Chaos Lord some respect!” Zhu Ge Chaos spoke, his tone diplomatic but clearly a warning.

“Of course, my Chaos Domain still has other methods left by the Chaos Lord. If this continues, we’ll have no choice but to use them all!” Zhu Ge Chaos smiled constantly, each word tightening Luo Tian’s brow.

“Show off! Do you think your Chaos Domain has methods left by the Epoch Lord?” Long Jie sneered, his voice loud. The Demon Realm also had supreme methods, and as its domain master, he knew this.

“Exactly! If we feared, we wouldn’t have come!” Nan Gong Yuqing sneered.

“Luo Tian, whether to fight or negotiate is all in your hands. I’ll grant you this favor,” Zhu Ge Chaos said, ignoring Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing. His gaze was intense on Luo Tian.

“If Lord Zhu Ge has spoken, I’ll accept this favor. But only once—no second chances if there’s a next time!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes glinting with amusement.

Luo Tian’s original goal was to enter the Chaos Abyss. Now that Zhu Ge Chaos had agreed, he decided not to continue attacking to reduce his group’s casualties.

Though they’d made a huge enemy of the Chaos Domain, Luo Tian knew he had to endure this. Even small actions would be obvious if they were done by the Chaos Domain.

“Good, three days later, bring those who wish to enter the Chaos Abyss to my domain. I’ll personally open it! No more than three people!” Zhu Ge Chaos smiled, gazing into the void.

“Stop hiding! Come out!” Zhu Ge Chaos called to the void, his voice cold.

“Indeed, enough of this performance!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness as he called to the void.

“Ha! Lord Zhu Ge still has his old fire!” Golden light flared, and Sun Miechen in a golden robe appeared.

“Luo Tian, I didn’t expect you to be so ruthless!” A crimson figure stepped from the void, Yan Hongtao’s gaze filled with admiration.

“Lord Zhu Ge, it’s been a while!” Zhou Wei smiled as he stepped from the void, approaching Luo Tian’s group with respect.

“What business do you have here?” Zhu Ge Chaos asked, scanning the three men before glancing at Luo Tian, Long Jie, and Nan Gong Yuqing. He sighed deeply.

“We merely wished to see how things turned out—no ill intent. Please don’t take offense, Lord Zhu Ge!” Sun Miechen spoke without deference.

Luo Tian and the others chuckled inwardly at Sun Miechen’s words. These three clearly sought to profit from the situation.

“Your growth is impressive. I truly am old,” Zhu Ge Chaos said, smiling but not revealing his thoughts.

“Father is still in seclusion, but he sent word that when he emerges, he’ll invite the elders to meet with you,” Sun Miechen replied lightly.

“Enough! Tell me your true purpose here. It’s not just to watch the show, is it?” Zhu Ge Chaos shook his head, unwilling to waste words. The battle with the Sacrificial Star Domain had ended, and though the Chaos Domain suffered heavy losses, its foundation remained. Thus, it wasn’t overly fearful of these three.

“I heard Lord Zhu Ge plans to open the Chaos Abyss. I’ve long wished to witness it, so I’ve come boldly,” Yan Xiuluo smiled, bowing to Zhu Ge Chaos.

Chapter 1433: Negotiations ()

“Dream on!” Sun Miechen’s words made Zhu Ge Jie and the Chaos Domain warriors’ faces darken, their eyes filled with anger toward Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao.

“Clever plan! We fought to the death, forcing the Chaos Domain to open this last resort. Yet you arrive and demand it for free?” Long Jie’s group also sneered at Sun Miechen.

Luo Tian stood silent, knowing these three sought to claim the Chaos Abyss as well.

Yet their actions made Luo Tian uneasy. The Chaos Abyss was the Chaos Domain’s territory, and though they weren’t fighting now, it didn’t mean Luo Tian would defend the Chaos Domain. Whether they allowed these three in was Zhu Ge Chaos’s decision.

Still, Luo Tian had his limits—anyone who dared to vie for Yuan Ci Immortal Light would face his wrath.

“Lord Zhu Ge, the nine last resorts are unclaimed. None of our domains have claimed them, yet the Chaos Domain has monopolized the Chaos Abyss, allowing only itself to enter. Isn’t this excessive?” Sun Miechen spoke boldly before Zhu Ge Chaos, his eyes threatening.

“Though I have some regard for Sun Miechen, I think he’s right,” Yan Hongtao said softly, gazing at Zhu Ge Chaos.

Zhou Wei stood beside Luo Tian but said nothing; his gaze was also on Zhu Ge Chaos, clearly agreeing with Sun Miechen.

Zhu Ge Chaos and the Chaos Domain’s warriors looked grim, realizing these three sought to pressure them.

Previously, no one had acted because no one led the charge. But now, with the Sacrificial Star Domain and Demon Realm clashing with the Chaos Domain, it was like a fuse lighting the other sacred domains’ ambitions.

The last resort of Chaos Abyss differed from others; the Chaos Domain had long coveted it. Though they couldn’t reach its depths, years of exploration gave them some insight. This helped the Chaos Domain’s people greatly improve their strength.

But these three clearly had pressure in mind. After the battle with Luo Tian’s group, though the Chaos Domain hadn’t lost its foundation, it had suffered massive losses. If they clashed with three sacred domains, they’d be doomed.

Zhu Ge Jie and others glared at Luo Tian’s group, thinking if not for the previous events, these sacred domains wouldn’t dare to pressure them so.

“Fine,” Zhu Ge Chaos sighed, having no choice but to agree. He gazed at Sun Miechen and the others.

“But opening the Chaos Abyss will cost your three domains. This is my limit—no negotiation.”

“Furthermore, each domain, including ours and the Sacrificial Star Domain, may only send one person!” Zhu Ge Chaos added, his voice unyielding.

“Lord Zhu Ge, you said earlier the cost would be yours. Why now it’s us?” Yan Hongtao frowned.

“That was for the Sacrificial Star Domain. The world’s good fortune can’t all be yours!” Zhu Ge Chaos spoke gravely.

“Lao Fu said this is my limit—no negotiation. If you don’t comply, we’ll choose to fight. Don’t push too hard!” Zhu Ge Chaos’s face darkened.

“Fine, a deal it is! Three days later, the Divine Clan will bring one-third of its resources,” Sun Miechen smiled, then ignored everyone and vanished into the void.

Luo Tian stood there, curious about what would be needed to open the Chaos Abyss—so costly it made the Chaos Domain grieve.

Yet he felt uneasy, as if used by these three. Though his goal was achieved, the Sacrificial Star Domain, Demon Realm, and Flame Domain had suffered some damage.

“Wait!” As Sun Miechen’s figure vanished into the void, Luo Tian shouted.

“What?” Sun Miechen turned back, his gaze puzzled as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Brother Sun, did you forget something?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the three.

“I don’t know what you mean,” Sun Miechen shook his head, watching Luo Tian’s smirk with a chill.

“Earlier we agreed—when we attacked the Chaos Domain, you’d pay us!” Luo Tian waved his hand at Sun Miechen.

“Wanting to use us as pawns without giving blood—what a clever plan! When did I ever do a losing deal!” Luo Tian inwardly sneered, his eyes threatening.

“Blackmail!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, everyone felt admiration, even Zhu Ge Chaos looked surprised. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to dare threaten three sacred domains so soon after clashing with the Chaos Domain.

“Ah…” Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed, locking onto Luo Tian before smiling: “What reward do you want? Speak!”

“Not much—just another set of resources for the Chaos Domain,” Luo Tian said softly, revealing his intent.

“Luo Tian! Don’t push too far!” Yan Hongtao’s face darkened, his gaze filled with danger.

The Chaos Domain people, for some reason, felt a sense of satisfaction hearing Luo Tian’s words. Clearly, they also resented these three sacred domains’ actions. Luo Tian’s group had fought with strength and suffered losses to force the Chaos Domain to open the Abyss. Yet these three domains had no right to act so arrogantly.

“Too far? What if I am?” Luo Tian gazed at Yan Hongtao, clearly showing the Sacrificial Star Domain no longer feared any single domain.

“Don’t you fear us uniting?” Sun Miechen’s gaze flickered, scanning Luo Tian’s group.

“Back then I alone, at the peak of Sainthood, dared to enter the Divine Clan’s sacred mountain. Do you think I’d fear?” Luo Tian shook his head, his words calm but clearly showing his strength.

“Fine, I agree. But be careful,” Sun Miechen’s gaze deepened before he vanished.

“You’re next, Yan Brother!” Luo Tian turned to Yan Hongtao, his gaze calm as he awaited the reply.

Yan Hongtao’s face was grim. Though reluctant, with Sun Miechen already agreeing and Zhou Wei close to Luo Tian, he had no choice but to nod reluctantly before vanishing into the void.

“We won’t bother Lord Zhu Ge any longer. Three days later, I’ll come to the Chaos Domain,” Luo Tian smiled, bowing to Zhu Ge Chaos before nodding at Long Jie and others. He stepped onto the Void Warship.

“Home!” Luo Tian whispered, pressing his hand on the warship. The massive vessel slowly opened, the Ancient Heaven Palace roaring as it pierced through space and vanished from the Chaos Domain.

Long Jie, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Lu Tianyu also led their factions back to their star domains.

As the warriors of each domain departed, the cosmos fell into silence. The Chaos Domain’s people stood silently on the gray mountain, gazing at Zhu Ge Chaos and Zhu Ge Jie.

“Old Lord, are we really giving up?” After a pause, the Chaos Domain’s people glared with anger.

This attack had been their worst since the Chaos Lord founded the domain. A sacred domain being beaten so severely was rare in history.

“Then what else can we do?” Zhu Ge Chaos’s face was stern, his gaze on the direction Luo Tian’s group had left. He sighed deeply.

Back then, Zhu Ge Chaos and other veteran figures knew Luo Tian was formidable. When he sacrificed himself, it had moved Zhu Ge Chaos, but he also felt relief at Luo Tian’s death. At that time, Luo Tian was terrifying—once grown, he would be invincible.

Zhu Ge Chaos never imagined Luo Tian returning with such power. Though his strength was still lacking, his influence was unquestionably the strongest in the nine domains. With such a battle against the Chaos Domain, Luo Tian had the power to annihilate any single domain. Unless at least two domains united, they couldn’t match Luo Tian’s group.

But even that was just a standoff—no way to destroy him. To annihilate him, the Divine Clan, Chaos Domain, Revenant Domain, and Starfall Domain would need to unite.

Yet sacred domains were all scheming; none could command two or three as Luo Tian did.

“As long as Luo Tian doesn’t die, no force in the nine domains can match him! Unless the Ancient Kings emerge!” Zhu Ge Chaos sighed, his face filled with admiration.

“Good, prepare to open the Chaos Abyss. Also, restore the domain’s operations quickly,” Zhu Ge Chaos gazed at Zhu Ge Jie, his eyes filled with pity.

The Harmonious Body Type was meant to be a prodigy who dominated an epoch, but now faced Luo Tian, this formidable enemy.

“This opening of the Chaos Abyss is also an opportunity for you. The Chaos Lord once entered it; perhaps there’s a legacy left. If you gain it, it may be your only chance to rival Luo Tian in this epoch!” Zhu Ge Chaos spoke to the furious Zhu Ge Jie.

Chapter 1434: Gathering at the Chaos Holy Palace ()

The nine domains saw that Luo Tian’s four factions had returned to their star domains. Yet the news of his near annihilation of the Chaos Domain spread across the nine, leaving people awestruck by his power.

Sacred domains were inviolable, yet Luo Tian had forced the Chaos Domain to submit, compelling it to open the Abyss. People marveled at his might.

Recently, the Sacrificial Star Domain had entered the Demon Realm to destroy the rebellious Phoenix Clan. The turmoil had just subsided, yet now Luo Tian led multiple factions to attack the Chaos Domain directly. It was shocking.

“Truly worthy of Luo Tian! Daring to attack a sacred domain and succeeding!”

“Indeed. It’s said the Divine Clan and Revenant Domain arrived, and Luo Tian extorted massive resources to gain entry into the Chaos Domain!” People murmured, their gazes filled with reverence toward the Sacrificial Star Domain.

Unspokenly, the title of “First in the Nine Domains” was bestowed upon Luo Tian. His prestige reached unparalleled heights.

The next day after Luo Tian’s group returned to the Sacrificial Star Domain, another astonishing news spread.

Revenant Domain Master Yan Hongtao had been ambushed on his return, clashing with an unknown warrior for half a day. He escaped wounded, and the mysterious warrior also suffered injuries before vanishing.

“Ancient Kings!” After returning to the Revenant Domain, Yan Hongtao revealed that his attacker was not from the nine domains but the Ancient Kings.

This news shocked the nine domains, leaving them stunned. The existence of the Ancient Kings was known, but they were sealed away by the Sky-Devouring Lord in another star domain. Yet now, their presence had appeared—and directly attacked the Revenant Domain Master, wounding him.

“How did the Ancient Kings escape? Have the nine last resorts been fully opened?” People had barely recovered from Luo Tian’s attack on a sacred domain when this news of the Ancient Kings’ emergence stunned them.

The appearance of the Ancient Kings was a major event for the nine domains, more terrifying than the chaos caused by the Demon Realm.

At that moment, only the Demon Realm’s Ming Huan and Ming Zhenyan knew of the Ancient Kings. Now, another had appeared—his strength enough to wound Yan Hongtao. This power posed a threat to humanity, spreading panic across the nine domains.

“Investigate! Find this Ancient King and capture him. Perhaps we can interrogate him for information!” Divine Clan’s Divine King Sun Miechen issued a call, urging people to search for this Ancient King.

Ming Huan was the son of an Ancient King, with Ming Zhenyan and the Epoch Treasure, the Demon Palace. He was hard to track. But this Ancient King was different—though he had wounded Yan Hongtao, Yan Hongtao said his strength matched his own. After being injured, he might be captured.

As everyone discussed this Ancient King, Luo Tian wore a bitter smile in the hall. He knew who had caused such chaos—the first move by Fu Xingyue had been so bold.

“Should we put on a show?” Diao Dezhu and others looked solemn, gazing at Luo Tian. If they didn’t search, it might raise suspicion.

“Search, but continue to seek Ming Huan!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. His killing intent radiated uncontrollably.

“Let Sun Miechen and Long Jie accompany me to the Chaos Abyss. You continue searching for Ming Huan. If found, find a way to rescue the children!” Luo Tian spoke softly, sending a message to Long Jie before leaving with Sun Kemin.

As they departed, others also acted, and the entire Sacrificial Star Domain launched a search for Ming Huan.

Luo Tian and Sun Kemin rode a teleportation array, arriving at the Chaos Domain in moments. They reached the edge of the Chaos Continent.

“Admit it, the Chaos Domain is powerful. It rebuilt itself in just three days!” Luo Tian and Sun Kemin marveled, gazing at the massive Chaos Continent.

“Elder Brother!” Long Jie smiled, standing there as he saw Luo Tian and Sun Kemin arrive. He had arrived earlier, waiting for Luo Tian.

Since Luo Tian’s return, they hadn’t met properly. Now, fighting together again filled Long Jie with excitement.
