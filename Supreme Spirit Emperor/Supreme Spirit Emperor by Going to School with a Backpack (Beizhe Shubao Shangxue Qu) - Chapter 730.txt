“Go!” Luo Xiting’s face was cold. Who were they? Once the masters of the Nine Domains, now reduced to prisoners. What could be more humiliating than that? If not for someone’s rescue, they would have truly been in danger.

“Thank you!” Luo Li bowed to his third uncle. As a younger brother, he knew that Luo Xiting was truly angry. When Luo Xiting was angry, blood would inevitably be spilled—just not now.

Four figures strode toward the outskirts of Zhou Guiwang City. After an hour, Luo Xiting’s eyes gleamed with divine light, and her body halted abruptly. Her gaze locked onto the distance.

“Return! Quickly!” Luo Xiting commanded, her form reversing as she flew back toward Zhou Guiwang City.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Li and Zheng Yao exchanged puzzled glances. Previously, when they were captured by the Liu family, Luo Xiting had not shown such panic.

“Someone is coming this way—killing anyone in their path!” Luo Xiting replied, her words causing Luo Li and Zheng Yao to frown. At present, only Zhou Guiwang City was safe.

The four sped back to Zhou Guiwang City and immediately rushed into the Zhou Guiwang Mansion.

“Announce that someone wishes to see Lord Zhou Guiwang!” Luo Li approached the mansion guards.

“Go away! How dare you disturb Lord Zhou Guiwang?” The guard, seeing Luo Xiting’s group possessed only realm-ascending cultivation, waved them off like flies.

“Again you?” The guard’s words had barely finished when an exasperated voice echoed. It was Luo Su, who had been wandering the city and just returned home.

“Who is he?” Luo Xiting’s eyes flashed with divine light, her gaze shifting between Luo Su and Luo Li. A suspicion formed in her mind.

“Probably a bother of a father!” Luo Li sighed, addressing Luo Xiting.

Chapter 2773: Obstruction

“What do you mean ‘probably’? It is!” Luo Xiting’s expression turned annoyed as she scrutinized Luo Su.

“Tens of thousands are coming this way, killing many along the path!” Luo Xiting informed Luo Su.

“Tens of thousands?” Upon hearing this, Luo Su’s brows furrowed slightly before dismissing it. The entire Zhou Guiwang City housed over a million people, plus its own army of 1.5 million. Tens of thousands could not possibly storm Zhou Guiwang City. Moreover, his mother and grandfather were nearly invincible within the city. Even an Immortal King at peak strength would find it impossible to seize Zhou Guiwang City unless three such masters converged.

Additionally, Zhou Guiwang City maintained its own intelligence network. How could they miss such a formidable force?

“Those people are strong!” Luo Xiting remarked. Among her peers, she was the most astute and immediately sensed Luo Su’s arrogance.

“Strong? To you, perhaps. But to Zhou Guiwang City, they are nothing!” Luo Su shook his head dismissively.

“Sigh…” The four exchanged glances, sighing deeply. They knew Luo Su looked down on them, but they had no choice—strength was the only language here.

“I wish I could beat him!” Luo Li muttered, but he couldn’t fight his younger brother.

“What should we do?” As Luo Su entered the courtyard, the four walked along the streets.

“Outdoors is definitely not an option. They’ll come for sure.”

“If Zhou Guiwang City doesn’t prepare, it might not stand a chance. Those people are too strong!” Luo Xiting spoke, her fate tied closely to this place. They would not leave.

“How can we make them believe us?” The group struggled, beginning to strategize.

Time passed slowly. As night deepened, most of Zhou Guiwang City’s people returned home to cultivate.

Dark figures emerged beyond the city walls, clad in black robes and veiled faces, moving like ghosts. Tens of thousands stood ten thousand zhang away from Zhou Guiwang City, their eyes fixed on its direction.

“They’ve come!” Luo Xiting’s gaze gleamed with an eerie light as she stared into the distance.

“Are you ready?”

“Finish quickly and run—else we’ll be beaten by Zhou Guiwang City’s people. That would be too humiliating!” Luo Li addressed Zheng Yao and Dong Yan’er, gathering ghost energy before them. Waves of power radiated from their hands.

“Throw!” Luo Xiting barked, and the three hurled their martial techniques toward Zhou Guiwang Mansion’s gates.

Boom!

The thunderous roar echoed through the silent night. Though they were only realm-ascending, their attack shattered the mansion’s gate.

“Who!” Almost instantly, a furious roar erupted from Zhou Guiwang Mansion. Two figures materialized at the gate—Su Dan and Su Cheng.

Upon appearing, they sensed the tremors in space but failed to detect who had attacked the gate.

“Who could silently strike?” Su Dan and Su Cheng exchanged glances, their expressions darkened.

Now was a time of turmoil. Earlier, they had received news that the former King of Ghosts had been slain, making them suspect someone targeted the kings.

“Search!” They ordered the city’s people rushing out.

“Have they discovered us?” Outside Zhou Guiwang City, a figure stood motionless, frowning as he watched the city’s lights flicker.

“Kill them—doesn’t matter!” The black-cloaked figure’s eyes flashed coldly, waving to his people.

“Kill who?” As the black-cloaked figure’s words faded, a formidable pressure descended. A figure materialized before the tens of thousands, appearing like a ghost in the dark night.

“Who?” The black-cloaked figure froze, his face contorted in shock as he gazed at the figure before him.

Golden divine patterns clutched in his hands, his face was unremarkable, but the overwhelming aura he radiated sent tremors through the tens of thousands.

“Immortal King at peak!”

“Lu…” The tens of thousands inhaled sharply, their eyes fixed on the figure before them, gripping a spear.

“Yes, it’s me!” Lu spoke softly. He hadn’t expected to meet these tens of thousands so soon. The leader was an old acquaintance—Jing Wu Ye.

“Unexpectedly, you still act the same!” Lu sneered, sensing Jing Wu Ye’s strength was only at realm-ascending peak.

“You!” Jing Wu Ye’s face darkened. Their group struggled to recover their prime, with only six of twelve having reached peak realm-ascending. Jing Wu Ye himself had barely recovered to realm-ascending late stage.

“Kill!” Lu wasted no words, raising his spear and charging at Jing Wu Ye.

In an instant, he reached Jing Wu Ye’s side. The spear’s cold tip sent a crushing pressure.

“Luoshengmen Formation, activate!” Jing Wu Ye bellowed. Though he was at realm-ascending late stage, his experience told him he couldn’t match Lu. Even the tens of thousands combined weren’t enough to kill Lu. Jing Wu Ye’s body exploded into black mist, vanishing instantly.

Simultaneously, the others formed a coordinated array, their bodies radiating fierce power.

Ghost energy surged, engulfing the tens of thousands. Lu stood motionless, his spear stained with blood.

“Have they fled?” Lu murmured softly, observing the tens of thousands gathered. He suddenly opened his eyes, golden divine light flashing like twin suns, illuminating the night.

The awakening of his Lightning Yang Eye revealed Jing Wu Ye at the formation’s center.

“Roar!” A deafening cry echoed as a black beast materialized before Lu—wolf-headed, lion-bodied, with two black wings. Its face was grotesque, possessing three eyes.

“Three-Eyed Ghost Lion!” Lu muttered, recognizing the beast as a legendary creature of Hell, rivaling the Three-Headed Dogs. Many factions revered it as a totem.

“Roar!” As Lu marveled, the Three-Eyed Ghost Lion roared and struck with a palm. The sky shattered in its wake.

Chapter 2774: Internal Turmoil

“Formation? What of it?” Lu scoffed, sensing danger but remaining unshaken. He activated his Law of the Universe Form, throwing a massive fist at the Three-Eyed Ghost Lion.

Boom!

The thunderous explosion echoed like a storm, shaking Zhou Guiwang City.

“Someone is fighting!”

“Father, stay behind—let me check!” Su Dan addressed Su Cheng, worried about a change. If something happened, Su Cheng could use the old King of Ghosts’ methods to cope.

“Be careful!” Su Cheng also wished to know the situation, urging Su Dan before she flew toward Lu and Jing Wu Ye.

The entire Zhou Guiwang City heard the deafening explosion, their minds in chaos over who fought outside.

Numerous people gathered, and among them stood Luo Li and Luo Xiting, their eyes filled with confusion.

“Someone is blocking those tens of thousands!” Luo Xiting whispered, knowing someone blocked them but not realizing it was Lu.

Their attack on Zhou Guiwang Mansion’s gate aimed to draw attention, preventing a surprise slaughter. Now it seemed they had overreacted.

Su Dan, puzzled, arrived at the battlefield and immediately saw the towering giant. Her eyes widened with excitement.

“Lu Tian!” Su Dan gazed at his imposing figure, disbelief etched on her face. She hadn’t expected Lu Tian to have reached peak Immortal King after so long.

“Ha! Return first—after I kill these Luoshengmen, I’ll find you!” Lu Tian stepped back, laughing as he addressed Su Dan.

“Good!” Su Dan didn’t hesitate. She sensed Lu Tian and the formation were beyond her current strength. Her heart swelled with pride—her man was so outstanding.

Her voice echoed across Zhou Guiwang City, sending it into chaos.

“It’s the son-in-law! The son-in-law has returned!”

“Unsurpassed by our Zhou Guiwang City’s son-in-law! He still remembers us!” The city rejoiced. Who didn’t know Luoshengmen’s strength? And Lu Tian’s battle with them was nearby. They could feel the power, far beyond their ability to join.

“Father?” Luo Xiting and Luo Li’s eyes also lit with joy, standing among the crowd.

“In the mansion, Lu Su was stunned. He hadn’t expected anyone to attack Zhou Guiwang City. He suddenly recalled the strange people earlier.

“How did they know?” Lu Su’s expression darkened, flying out of the city to find Luo Xiting and others.

“Little girl, I didn’t expect you to return!” At this moment, Luo Li and others were cornered by a youth. It was Liu Chengdong of the Liu family in Zhou Guiwang City. He had thought Luo Li’s group had left but learned they returned, so he led his men to corner them.

“Run!” Luo Li’s group grimaced. Earlier, Luo Li had forced space to escape the mansion gate, exhausting them. They couldn’t repeat it now.

The entire city was chaotic; no one noticed their plight. Even if they fought, an Immortal King wouldn’t stir much.

“Capture them!” Liu Chengdong laughed, stepping toward Luo Li’s group.

“Kill!” Zheng Yaoyi growled, brandishing a hammer and charging at Liu Chengdong.

But before Zheng Yaoyi moved, a figure appeared before him. A hand slapped his hammer, and a kick sent him flying.

“Don’t resist—father coming to Zhou Guiwang City will find us!” Luo Xiting coldly spoke, her gaze on the distance. She could see Lu Tian’s battle nearing its end.

“You’re wise!” Liu Chengdong eyed Luo Xiting and Dong Yan’er, drooling as he ordered his men to take them.

“What are you doing?” But before Liu Chengdong’s group could leave, Lu Su arrived.

“Lu! Lu Su!” Seeing Lu Su, Liu Chengdong’s face darkened—unexpectedly, he appeared here.

“Us!” Liu Chengdong instinctively retreated but had no answer.

“Unexpectedly, you still dare to appear!” As Liu Chengdong retreated, a figure emerged from the shadows. A pressure descended as he grabbed Lu Su.

“You dare!” Lu Su gasped, brandishing his black sword to strike the hand.

…

The black sword was instantly shattered by the hand, and Lu Su was seized. Simultaneously, the gaunt old man waved his sleeve, capturing Liu Chengdong and Luo Xiting’s group without a sound.

“Where is Lu Su?” Su Dan frowned at the city gate, sensing an ominous connection with her son. She scanned around and activated the old King of Ghosts’ methods to search for Lu Su. Upon finding him, her face darkened.

“The old King of Ghosts’ methods were suppressed!” Su Dan spoke, causing Su Cheng’s face to pale.

“Kill!” In an instant, several figures emerged from two directions, ruthlessly slaughtering Zhou Guiwang City’s people.

“Lord, the Liu and Zhao families have rebelled! Many strong ones appeared!” A black-cloaked figure reported.

“The Liu and Zhao families?” Su Dan and Su Cheng exchanged glances, stunned by the city’s internal rebellion.

“Calculated—cooperating from within and using mysterious methods to suppress the old King of Ghosts’ techniques!” They instantly understood, rushing to gather forces.

“I’ll see what courage they have to rebel!” Su Cheng’s aura surged as he took flight, returning to Zhou Guiwang City.

Chapter 2775: Might

Boom! Boom! Boom…

On another side, Lu Tian focused on battling the Three-Eyed Ghost Lion formed by the formation. The beast’s aura was weak, with black corpses falling from the array.

One thousand… two thousand…

Figures fell one by one, and Jing Wu Ye, pale-faced with blood trickling from his mouth, stood amidst the array.

Even Jing Wu Ye was like this—others were worse, their bodies riddled with cracks, on the verge of shattering.

“Six Paths Reincarnation!” Lu Tian roared, stepping into the void and appearing before the Three-Eyed Ghost Lion. He threw a fist.

“Kill!” Jing Wu Ye bellowed, commanding the array to fight Lu Tian but was repelled. Thousands of figures turned into blood mist, falling from the array.

As he repelled them, Lu Tian’s form reappeared, his fists raining down on the array. The scene was breathtaking.

Boom!

As Lu Tian attacked the array, a thunderous roar erupted from Zhou Guiwang City. Lu Tian’s body paused slightly.

“Zhou Guiwang City is in trouble!” Lu Tian instantly understood, accelerating his attack.

Boom! Boom! Boom…

The heavy sound echoed through the sky. Lu Tian’s fists were unstoppable, each strike killing thousands.

Finally, after Lu Tian’s blows, the Three-Eyed Ghost Lion’s massive body could no longer endure and shattered with a thunderous crash.

Lu Tian raised his hand, twisting the black sky into a vortex. A deafening roar echoed from within as a black claw burst through, striking Jing Wu Ye.

“Damn it!” Jing Wu Ye’s face was grim. His hands moved, unleashing a violent wave that formed into a sword, striking the black claw.

In an instant, the black claw collided with the dark sword. The sword was shattered instantly but still struck Jing Wu Ye.

Boom! Boom! Boom…

Under the overwhelming pressure, the remaining Luoshengmen turned into blood mist. Jing Wu Ye’s body was also struck by the claw, crushed to the ground.

Cough! Cough!

Jing Wu Ye coughed blood, his eyes filled with resentment. He tried to flee but was crushed by a massive foot descending upon his head.

“Martial God’s Wrath, Step One!”
“Martial God’s Wrath, Step Two—Shatter the Stars!”
“Martial God’s Wrath, Step Seven—Crush Eternity!”

Seven steps in total, as if crushing the earth. Lu Tian stood in a crater, his surroundings cracked for tens of thousands of zhang. Even Zhou Guiwang City’s walls crumbled. Jing Wu Ye was crushed to death by the sheer force.

“It’s time for Zhou Guiwang City!” Lu Tian took flight, his massive body moving swiftly. With one step, he arrived above Zhou Guiwang City.

At this moment, the city’s sky was in chaos. Su Cheng and Su Dan faced three Immortal Kings—two at late stage, one at mid-stage.

As Lu Tian arrived, the entire Zhou Guiwang City stilled. All eyes turned to the towering figure of Lu Tian.

“Die!” Lu Tian’s hand grabbed the three opponents fighting Su Dan and Su Cheng. The three felt space constrict, their bodies frozen in place.

“Subdue!” Lu Tian’s eyes glowed with brilliance. Lightning appeared before him, and he waved his hand—thousands of thunderbolts rained down, precisely striking the rebel forces.

Lu Tian’s hand clenched into a fist, and the mid-stage Immortal King turned to blood mist. The two late-stage ones were also struck by lightning, disintegrating from sight.

“Glory!”
“Invincible!” The people of Zhou Guiwang City roared, their voices filled with fervor. Hell revered strength; Lu Tian’s might was enough to subdue the entire city.

Su Dan’s face lit with admiration, gazing at Lu Tian—this was the first time she had such an expression.

“Ha!” Su Cheng laughed, gazing at Lu Tian with relief for choosing such a son-in-law.

“Father!” A joyous voice echoed as a figure flew from the ground—Luo Su.

Previously, Luo Su and others had been captured by the Liu family. They were puzzled why Luo Xiting didn’t seem worried until Lu Tian arrived, revealing the truth.

“Susu!” Lu Tian’s face softened as he gently patted Luo Su’s shoulder, and suddenly, Luo Su was at his side.

The most surprising part for Lu Tian was that Luo Li, Luo Xiting, Zheng Yaoyi, and Dong Yan’er were all present.

“Master!”
“Father!” As Luo Su gaped, Luo Li and Luo Xiting approached, their eyes filled with excitement. No matter how matured their minds were, they still acted like children before Lu Tian.

“You…!” Luo Su’s eyes widened in disbelief, speechless as he gazed at Luo Li and the others.

“Little brother, I am your elder! This is your sister!” Luo Li smiled, approaching Luo Su.

Luo Xiting glared at Luo Su, making him instinctively rub his nose.

“This girl!” Lu Tian muttered internally, glancing at Zheng Yaoyi with sympathy—Zheng Yaoyi had often been bullied by Luo Xiting.

Su Dan’s face was slightly awkward—more accurately, embarrassed. After all, these two were Luo Tian’s other children. She was unsure how to respond.

“This must be Fifth Wife!” Lu Tian spoke, sensing Su Dan’s awkwardness and smiling at her. He secretly marveled at this woman—she was younger than himself.

It was chaotic!

Lu Tian felt equally awkward, but after a moment of silence, he addressed everyone: “Everyone, let’s return first!”

They landed in the mansion. Under Su Cheng’s guidance, they entered a grand hall.

“Sorry, elder brother and sister…” Luo Su addressed Luo Li and Luo Xiting.

Luo Su felt a sense of loneliness, longing for siblings.

“No problem, no problem. Good little brother, listen to your elder’s words, okay?” Luo Li laughed, hugging Luo Su’s shoulder.

“Ha! Elder brother, I am your elder too. Don’t let this elder deceive you—he almost went astray before!” Gu Guanyu laughed, finding a companion. The three quickly gathered together but didn’t stay long before Luo Xiting grabbed both by the ears, pulling them back: “Little brother Su, don’t stay with these two. They’re not good people—don’t learn bad habits!”

“Father, you must nurture Su well. Don’t let him become like Li—almost ruined! Look at how these uncles have taught him!” Luo Xiting spoke, making Lu Tian’s face dark. Su Dan also eyed Luo Li and Gu Guanyu with suspicion.

Chapter 2776: Black and White Reapers Severely Injured

In the grand hall of Zhou Guiwang Mansion, Lu Tian, Su Dan, and Su Cheng sat. The younger generation had left.

“Do we really need to relocate?” Su Cheng’s eyes showed reluctance. Though not a traditionalist, Zhou Guiwang City had existed for countless years—his entire life was there. He truly didn’t want to leave.

“Truly must relocate. Hell is now so chaotic! If I hadn’t returned by chance, Zhou Guiwang City might have been destroyed by Luoshengmen!” Lu Tian spoke, his voice laced with relief.

Hearing this, Su Cheng and Su Dan fell silent before Su Dan finally spoke: “Father, let’s move. I think Lu Tian is right. In the Central Three Realms, we might be safer. Now that Yama’s Ten Halls and Luoshengmen are fighting fiercely, no one has time to care about us!”

“Let me think it over,” Su Cheng sighed. Lu Tian didn’t press further; as long as he was there, safety wasn’t an issue. Lu Tian and Su Dan left the hall, stepping outside where the younger generation chatted happily—already adapting to their relationships.

“Elders, you live so vividly! I wish I could be like you one day. My grandfather and mother won’t let me leave Zhou Guiwang City for a thousand zhang!” Luo Su listened to Gu Guanyu recounting events from the Nine Domains, his eyes filled with longing.

“If I truly go to the Central Three Realms, will it upset your sisters?” Su Dan glanced at the younger ones’ harmonious interactions, a smile on her face.

“Don’t worry—they’ll understand!” Lu Tian said, though he added a ‘perhaps’ in his mind. He knew he’d lose another layer of skin.

“You look so pitiful!” Su Dan shot him a disapproving glance, her allure radiating. Lu Tian was momentarily stunned.

Faced with Su Dan’s seductive presence, no man could resist. Lu Tian forced down his desire and walked with Su Dan through Zhou Guiwang City’s streets.

…For the next few days, Lu Tian stayed in Zhou Guiwang City with his children. However, as they settled in, he grew anxious—according to Zhou Guiwang City’s intelligence, the Central Three Realms were still chaotic. Though they had received news that Tianyuan Sect held an advantage, unexpected events could still occur.

During these days, Hell had seen many major events: Luoshengmen attacked the Equal Hall, several Yama Lords rushed to aid but arrived too late. A few Immortal Kings fought for days, finally deciding the outcome—several Yama Lords were wounded and returned to their halls. The Equal Hall’s master perished.

This shocked Hell, but another news spread: the Eight Great Kings of Hell and their eight cities were simultaneously attacked. Three cities were destroyed outright. Luoshengmen had become a rising power in Hell, surpassing expectations.

“Relocate!” Su Cheng saw Lu Tian’s anxiety and received the news, finally deciding to move Zhou Guiwang City to the Central Three Realms.

With Su Cheng’s decision, the city’s people began preparations—though it would take time.

“Relocating to the Central Three Realms!” The city’s people spread this news, most delighted—Hell was more chaotic than the Central Three Realms.

“You two prepare first—I’ll check on the Reincarnation Hall!” Lu Tian, upon Su Cheng’s decision, smiled but worried about the Reincarnation Hall.

While Zhou Guiwang City prepared to move, Lu Tian left for the Reincarnation Hall. His Immortal King peak strength allowed him to travel swiftly, arriving at the hall’s gates in days.

The vast Reincarnation Hall still stood imposing, radiating a sinister aura beneath the black sky.

Lu Tian marveled at it, gazing at the hall. Though imposing, it exuded a quiet solemnity.

“What happened?” Lu Tian frowned as he landed outside the hall, causing the two guards to tremble.

“Senior Disciple!” They gasped in disbelief, rubbing their eyes.

“What’s wrong?” Lu Tian asked, sensing the hall’s atmosphere was off.

“The Hall Master is injured. Senior Disciple, hurry and see!” The two guards didn’t hesitate, urgently informing Lu Tian.

Lu Tian was stunned, stepping into the hall. The Black and White Reapers had done him favors; he couldn’t ignore it.

As Lu Tian entered the hall, figures emerged, their eyes filled with surprise. They had heard of his ascension to Immortal King peak but hadn’t expected to see it so soon.

“Master, what’s wrong?” Lu Tian saw Du Jianhang at the forefront and bowed respectfully.

“Truly reached peak!” The Reincarnation Hall’s people inhaled sharply, though they had heard of it, seeing it was another matter.

“Good! Good! Good!” Du Jianhang said three times, his heart light with joy.

“Go see the Hall Master—he’s severely injured. See if you can help!” Du Jianhang spoke, his eyes filled with sorrow.

Du Jianhang led Lu Tian into the hall, swiftly entering its final chamber. There, he saw the Black and White Reapers—though now they were only half-white, lying there with weak breaths.

“Such a severe injury?” Lu Tian’s eyes narrowed as he approached the Reapers.

“You’ve come!”
“I truly didn’t misjudge you!” The Black and White Reapers smiled, though their expressions were bitter.

“How did this happen?” Lu Tian asked, knowing the Reapers’ strength. To injure them so severely meant their opponent was fearsome.

“Luoshengmen, they’re terrifying! Plus the Luoshengmen’s master—seven Immortal Kings at peak strength, no weaker than our Yama Ten Halls!” The Reapers spoke, recounting the Equal Hall battle.

In summary, it was a word—horrific! Immortal King peak battles resulted in deaths. The Reapers were injured so severely, showing how earth-shattering the battle was.

“We had eight of us; three were wounded, one died, and the rest suffered varying injuries!” The Reapers sighed.

“What’s your plan next?” Lu Tian gazed at the Reapers, their current state a blow to the Reincarnation Hall.

Hearing Lu Tian’s question, the Reapers shook their heads gently, gazing at him: “Hope you can protect the Reincarnation Hall!”

Chapter 2777: Reincarnated Son

Hearing the Reapers’ words, Lu Tian was momentarily stunned before nodding. Regardless of the Reapers, if something happened to the Reincarnation Hall, he couldn’t ignore it.

“But I might not be able to protect it either!” Lu Tian sighed, a group of eight peak masters had been killed—three wounded, one dead. He was only just reaching Immortal King peak. How could he withstand?

“You can!” The Reapers’ white eyes gazed at Lu Tian, their expressions profound.

“Tell me—what secrets do I not know?” Lu Tian gazed at the Reapers, his eyes serious.

Lu Tian had long wondered why the Black and White Reapers had always shown him kindness since entering the Reincarnation Hall, covering his mistakes.

“Because you are the Reincarnated Son—descendant of the Reincarnation Emperor!” The Reapers spoke, their eyes filled with reverence.

The Reincarnation Emperor—mentioning him sent a wave of reverence through the hall’s others.

“Reincarnation Emperor?” Lu Tian furrowed his brows, having heard of the Reincarnation Emperor but not knowing of such a figure.

The entire Reincarnation Path was created by the Reincarnation Emperor, allowing all things to balance.

“Back then, when you were in the Fengdu Hall, your quick understanding of Reincarnation Power was likely due to your soul. No one else could grasp it so quickly!”

“And you—should I be correct, you were born from Reincarnation itself. Thus, I call you the Reincarnated Son!”

“People know Hell’s founders were Shentu and Yulu Emperors, but few know before them was the Reincarnation Emperor!”

“Eighteen Hells were created by Shentu and Yulu, so this secret was known only to the Yama Hall Masters. Even the Eight Great Kings didn’t know it!” The Reapers spoke.

“The Reincarnated Son’s appearance was known to the Hall Masters, and I told them!”

“But at that time, our opinions clashed. Some suggested killing you; others advised observing. I bet on you—now it seems my gamble was right! Your growth exceeds my expectations!” The Reapers smiled.

“I didn’t know that!” Lu Tian only knew of his nine reincarnations, and his father was Luo Nantian. As for before the nine, he didn’t know who he was.

“This battle will grant Hell a brief peace. Though we suffered heavy losses, Luoshengmen also did. They’ve taken three Yama Halls and lack manpower. I estimate at least fifty years!”

“So, you have fifty years to reach Half-Emperor Stage!” The Reapers spoke, gazing at Lu Tian.

“Half-Emperor Stage!” Lu Tian grimaced. He had barely reached Immortal King peak by stepping on so many people.

“You can!” The Reapers continued, “Your opportunity lies in the Ghost-Devil Marsh.”

“Ghost-Devil Marsh?” Lu Tian’s lips twitched, recalling his painful days there. At Immortal King stage, he had felt like an ant.

“How can you recover?” Lu Tian asked, most concerned about the Reapers’ recovery.

“Don’t know—almost died, I sacrificed one Reincarnation Body to save my life!” The Reapers’ eyes showed fear as they spoke.

“I’ll return to the Central Three Realms first—fetch two people to examine you. As for Ghost-Devil Marsh, I’ll think it over. At least I must handle the current matters first!” Lu Tian decided.

“Hmm, go.”

“The Reincarnation Hall doesn’t need your worry—these old bones can endure!” The Reapers replied, knowing the Central Three Realms were now a chaotic realm.

“Why not move the Reincarnation Hall to the Central Three Realms too? Zhou Guiwang City has already begun relocating!” Lu Tian invited, hoping the Reincarnation Hall would join.

“No—don’t move!” The Reapers shook their heads, and the others in the hall did too. The Reincarnation Hall was their root; they couldn’t leave.
