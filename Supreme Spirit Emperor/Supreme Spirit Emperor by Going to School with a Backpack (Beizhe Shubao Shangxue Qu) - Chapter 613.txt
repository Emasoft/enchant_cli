"Master Tianxin has arrived!" Chen Baitian's face bore a faint smile. After Luo Tian had awakened, it had been a year, and Chen Baitian cherished the moments when Luo Tian was awake.

"Father, I still wish to see the Huanmo Stone!" Luo Tian spoke plainly, his desire to witness the Huanmo Stone unrelenting. He did not wish to linger here for long; if he remained, he might grow reluctant to leave.

"Ah..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Chen Baitian mused for a moment before addressing him: "However, the Grand Elder is currently in seclusion, striving to ascend to the middle stage of Immortal King. You must wait until he emerges before you may view the Huanmo Stone."

"Very well," Luo Tian sighed inwardly, frustrated. If the Butan Stone were present, he could have easily located the Huanmo Stone with it.

"Boy, you've finally awakened. You're no longer a child; it's time to consider your lifelong commitments. I've arranged for you to wed the daughter of the Flying Moon Sect's master, Ren Qianxue!" Chen Baitian declared.

"Um... I have other matters. I'll be leaving now," Luo Tian quickly replied, making a hasty retreat toward the door.

"Return here, you always do this! This time, I won't let you escape!" Before Luo Tian could flee, Chen Baitian seized him with a single hand.

"For the next few days, you'll stay put. No wandering off. Even if Ren Qianxue isn't suitable, there's the daughter of the Falling Rainbow Sect. I'll ensure your marriage is settled this time!" Chen Baitian chuckled, issuing a threat to Luo Tian.

"Ah..." Luo Tian was speechless but could not break free from Chen Baitian's grip.

"For the next few days, you'll adapt to your new identity. I know you've just awakened and may struggle with this environment. Go check the library," Chen Baitian said, sealing Luo Tian's cultivation and carrying him to the location of the Flying Heaven Sect's library. Before Luo Tian could protest, he was thrown into the grand hall.

"Thud..." Luo Tian watched the heavy door close behind him, his lips twitching. His cultivation flowed sluggishly.

"What is this?" Luo Tian sensed the method Chen Baitian had used to seal him. Though he now bore another identity, his strength remained; ordinary seals could not contain his cultivation.

"Somewhat like the Dao of Seeding Demonry!" Luo Tian felt the golden divine patterns encircling his dantian. Though not demonic, they were remarkably stable.

"Could it be..." Luo Tian's heart jolted. He stepped toward the shelves of books.

"The Middle Heaven's Flying Heaven Sect, ranked thirteenth among the hundred sects. It is a top-tier sect in the Middle Heaven," Luo Tian quickly found an introduction to the Flying Heaven Sect.

"Nine Immortal Mountains!" He then perused more materials, concerning the entire immortal realm. Luo Tian discovered that eight of the nine Immortal Mountains in the Upper Heaven still existed.

"The Dao Mountain still exists!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with excitement. He thought of much—though this environment was illusory, it remained the immortal realm, meaning a specific era within it.

"Master of the Mind Demon, Chen Tianxin!" Luo Tian's mind suddenly recalled. He had once dwelled in Butan Mountain, and Butan Mountain had a deep connection with Master of the Mind Demon. The latter had been slain by Butan Immortal King himself. Naturally, there were records of Master of the Mind Demon.

Previously, Luo Tian had been muddled, but now that he was awake, he instantly recalled Master of the Mind Demon's name—Chen Tianxin. Clearly, he was in the younger days of Master of the Mind Demon.

"Almost... I almost believed I was Chen Tianxin!" Luo Tian's forehead beaded with sweat. If the events had proceeded as planned, he would have been slain by Butan Immortal King.

"What consequences would death in this illusion bring? I suppose if he truly died, his soul might be severely wounded or even annihilated. Being in an illusion, there could be no danger at all!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, continuing to peruse the materials.

"Still, if I could witness the appearance of Dao Mountain, it would be quite remarkable!" Luo Tian mused, his eyes revealing an odd expression.

Time passed. Two days later, Luo Tian had roughly understood the Flying Heaven Sect's current situation and those around him.

"Master Tianxin, come with me!" On the third morning, Chen Baitian appeared at the library's entrance, a smile on his face.

"Ah..." Luo Tian said nothing. At present, he was another's son, and his sole desire was to see the Huanmo Stone quickly and return to normal. He felt it better to comply with Chen Baitian for now.

Seeing Luo Tian's obedience, Chen Baitian's face softened slightly. He led Luo Tian toward the Flying Heaven Sect's main hall.

Upon entering, Luo Tian was scrutinized by many eyes—Kuang Fenghua and other young men, as well as several middle-aged individuals. Another group smiled, also observing Luo Tian. The leading middle-aged man, upon seeing Luo Tian's cultivation level of True Immortal Late Stage, had his eyes flicker with interest.

"Master Chen's son truly excels. At such a young age, he has reached True Immortal Late Stage. It's truly humbling!" The middle-aged man smiled, addressing Chen Baitian.

"Qianxue is a phoenix among women. My son's success was merely luck—being struck by lightning and opening his spiritual orifice. If he had trained normally, he would not have matched Qianxue!" Chen Baitian replied, his gaze turning to the woman beside the middle-aged man.

"Qianxue..." Luo Tian was speechless, observing the young woman standing beside the middle-aged man. Her appearance closely resembled Gu Qianxue.

"Haha, Qianxue, greet your Master Tianxin Senior!" The middle-aged man chuckled, addressing the woman.

"Father, I will not yield. No one can separate me from Master Luo!" The young woman's face bore determination, addressing the middle-aged man. This caused an awkward atmosphere in the hall.

"Master, I heard Master Tianxin Senior often sleeps, for ten years at a time. Each awakening lasts only a year. Isn't this pushing Qianxue into the fire?" At the awkward moment, another young man's voice echoed, making the atmosphere tense.

"Idiot!" Luo Tian saw the youth who had spoken and cursed inwardly. The man's face resembled Fu Bei's, causing Luo Tian to want to strike him.

"Rubbish! Marriage is a matter of parents. This was decided by Master Chen and me. There's no room for discussion!" The middle-aged man, hearing the young man's words, grew dark.

"Who are you?" Kuang Fenghua could not bear it and turned to the young man.

"My name is Luo Tian," the youth replied, his voice carrying a hint of amusement. This made Luo Tian's face darken further.

Chapter 2316: Crushed in Two Fists

"Damn!" Luo Tian muttered upon hearing the youth with a pale face claiming to be Luo Tian.

This exclamation drew everyone's attention. Ren Qianxue's father furrowed his brow.

"Uh..." Luo Tian was taken aback, then scratched his head. His gaze turned fierce toward the youth.

"Ah, Master Ren, my son has been a bit confused lately. Please don't take it to heart," Chen Baitian chuckled, addressing Ren Qianxue's father.

"It's fine. Youthful outbursts are natural," Ren Qianxue's father smiled.

"Such a person wants to marry Qianxue? That's pure fantasy!" The youth named Luo Tian muttered, deepening the awkward atmosphere.

"Qianxue... Senior Sister. You mean that Luo Senior is this Luo Tian?" Luo Tian felt awkward but addressed Ren Qianxue.

"Yes, we've been childhood friends. No one can separate us!" Ren Qianxue replied softly, gazing at the real Luo Tian.

"What kind of situation is this?" Luo Tian muttered. He hadn't expected Fu Bei to still linger in the illusion.

"If Qianxue doesn't agree, I suppose this matter is settled," Luo Tian chuckled, then gazed at the pale-faced youth. He calculated how to eliminate this fly.

"Indeed, Master Tianxin isn't lacking in women. Many girls would rush to marry Master Tianxin. Not just any commoner can wed Master Tianxin!" Kuang Fenghua and others sneered.

At this point, these people realized that they weren't here to marry but to humiliate the Flying Heaven Sect.

"Who are you calling a commoner?" The pale-faced youth was indignant, his face reddening. He gazed at Kuang Fenghua and others. The Flying Moon Sect's young men also spoke.

"Just some conceited people, right? If you don't want to marry, then don't. Why make such a scene? Who's being made to look bad?" Kuang Fenghua sneered, shouting at the Flying Moon Sect's young men.

Chen Baitian's face darkened as he gazed at the Flying Moon Sect's master. He now understood that the Flying Moon Sect had come to cause trouble.

Chen Baitian and Master Ren Wuyue were old friends. Later, they had arranged for Chen Tianxin to wed Ren Qianxue. However, over the years, Chen Tianxin had always been asleep. Each awakening, he would find an excuse to avoid it, so the match hadn't been finalized.

This time, Chen Tianxin had awakened. Chen Baitian decided to bring up the matter again, as Chen Tianxin was now over a hundred years old.

Chen Baitian hadn't expected Master Ren Wuyue to bring people and cause such a scene.

"Silence!" Seeing Chen Baitian's dark gaze, Master Ren Wuyue's face also darkened. He barked, silencing the hall.

"Master Chen, I was unwise. Rest assured, I will give you an answer."

"Smack!" Master Ren Wuyue addressed Chen Baitian, then suddenly turned and slapped the pale-faced youth's face. The crisp sound of the slap echoed through the hall, swelling the youth's face.

"Master!" The pale-faced youth lay on the ground, gazing at Master Ren Wuyue in disbelief. He hadn't expected his master to strike him.

"Rebellious disciple!"

"If it weren't for you, this wouldn't have happened. I'll kill you!" Master Ren Wuyue's face was cold, his voice sharp as he stepped toward the pale-faced youth.

Chen Baitian did not act but watched Master Ren Wuyue with amusement. Chen Baitian was no fool; if Master Ren Wuyue had truly intended to kill the pale-faced youth, he wouldn't have brought him to the Flying Heaven Sect.

"Let me stop you. Don't even think about it," Chen Baitian thought, his gaze toward Master Ren Wuyue changing.

"Uncle, please stop!" However, Chen Baitian and the Flying Heaven Sect's people did not intervene. But Luo Tian quickly spoke.

"Respected Uncle, please speak," Master Ren Wuyue turned upon hearing the call. He saw Luo Tian standing there with a smile.

"Respected Elder, this rebellious disciple is unworthy of your hands. I would be honored to take his place!" Luo Tian smiled, stepping toward the pale-faced youth.

"You..." Ren Qianxue's eyes flashed anger. She had expected Luo Tian to plead, but instead, he was about to strike.

Others were also stunned. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to say such a thing. Master Ren Wuyue also gazed at Luo Tian.

"Do you like Qianxue, then? But this pale-faced youth seems weak. I could break him with one punch!"

"Would you like to give up the marriage? Fight me on a life-and-death stage. Dare you?" Luo Tian's eyes held contempt as he gazed at the pale-faced youth.

"Da! What's there to fear? I'm not afraid of Ye Sheng from Star River Palace. How could I be afraid of you?" The youth named Luo Tian's eyes held disdain.

"Ye Sheng?" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the pale-faced youth. He then spoke softly: "At least he has some backbone. However, I'll kill him for Master Ren."

Luo Tian could no longer bear it. This pale-faced youth not only wanted to steal his wife but also his name. And in the illusion, if Luo Tian could tolerate this, he wouldn't be Luo Tian.

"Good!" The youth resembling Fu Bei nodded quickly. He didn't know how strong Chen Tianxin was, but he had heard that Chen Tianxin often slept. Though his strength was formidable, it lacked practical experience.

"Haha, Master Tianxin Senior, defeat that youth!" Kuang Fenghua and others shouted, their voices filled with anticipation.

"This might not be good," Master Ren Wuyue's face showed hesitation, gazing at Chen Baitian.

"It's fine. Youthful energy is natural," Chen Baitian chuckled, then stepped out of the hall.

Master Ren Wuyue's face showed helplessness. He transmitted to the youth resembling Fu Bei: "Don't look at Master Chen's words, but don't kill him. We can't bear the Flying Heaven Sect's wrath."

"Yes, I understand," the youth transmitted secretly. However, he had another plan. He knew killing Luo Tian was impossible, but humiliating him would be feasible.

They arrived at the Flying Heaven Sect's training ground. A central platform stood there, with no Flying Heaven Sect disciples on it. Below the platform were many Flying Heaven Sect disciples who had gathered, having heard the news.

"Master Tianxin Senior is going to fight the Flying Moon Sect's Luo Tian? Is this true?" The disciples murmured, their eyes filled with concern.

"It can't be," they said. "That Luo Tian is a top twenty genius in the Middle Heaven. I heard he had faced Ye Sheng from Star River Palace and lost with three moves, but that record is still admirable!" Their eyes showed concern. The Flying Heaven Sect disciples rarely saw Chen Tianxin fight.

"What if this boy brings us a surprise?" Chen Baitian's eyes showed expectation, watching Luo Tian step onto the platform. The youth resembling Fu Bei also stepped onto the platform, gazing at Luo Tian with disdain.

"Since you're about to die, let me let you strike first!" Luo Tian spoke softly, unimpressed by the youth's disdain.

"Haha, Master Chen, you strike first. I fear if I strike, you won't even have a chance!" The youth laughed.

"That's what I wanted to say. However, if you have any last words, speak quickly. Give you some time!" Luo Tian replied.

"Buzz..." A golden sword appeared in the youth's hand. His white robe was snow-like, his pale face carrying an otherworldly aura, as if a celestial being. His charm made the Flying Heaven Sect's female disciples momentarily stunned.

"Paltry youth, no good intentions!" Luo Tian sneered, stepping forward toward the youth.

"Buzz..." The sword's aura flashed. A golden blade surged from the youth's hand, its energy reaching for the heavens, slicing toward Luo Tian.

In an instant, the golden blade struck Luo Tian. The crowd gasped in shock.

"Master Tianxin!" Kuang Fenghua and others' eyes showed anxiety, shouting but unable to speak.

"Has it ended already?" The youth muttered in his heart. He hadn't expected Chen Tianxin to be so weak, unable to even dodge his single strike.

"Be careful!" Master Ren Wuyue's eyes suddenly narrowed, shouting at the youth.

"Boom..." Under everyone's astonished gaze, Luo Tian's figure exploded. The blade struck the platform, leaving a deep gash.

"You're truly weak!" A cold voice echoed in the youth's ears, making him shiver. He regained clarity but saw a figure reflected in his eyes—along with a golden fist.

"Crack..." A crackling sound echoed. The youth saw a blur of fists, then darkness. It felt as if he had been struck by a hammer on his forehead, blood spewing uncontrollably from his mouth.

"Boom..." His battered body fell to the ground, a large bump on his forehead with cracks surrounding it.

"Damn!" The youth's eyes regained vision. He staggered to his feet, gazing around.

"An ant! You're just a stronger ant!" The youth had barely stood when the cold voice echoed again. Luo Tian's eyes, filled with killing intent, appeared once more. This time, two fists.

"Boom..." The youth's body was thrown back again, cracks spreading from his head to his entire body. People watching the youth's fall were stunned. They hadn't expected Chen Tianxin to be so formidable.

"This is the strength of Master Tianxin!" The Flying Heaven Sect disciples murmured. However, to Luo Tian's ears, it was somewhat uncomfortable.

Chapter 2317: Massacre of the Sect

"This is a genius! See it?" Kuang Fenghua and others' faces bore satisfaction, watching Luo Tian step forward again.

The youth struggled to stand, swaying. He gazed at the approaching Luo Tian with trembling fear. He hadn't expected Chen Tianxin to be so strong.

He had fought against the genius of Star River Palace. In his eyes, Ye Sheng was no match for this Chen Tianxin. It was a feeling of complete helplessness.

Everyone was astonished as Luo Tian appeared like a ghost before the youth. His cold eyes and killing intent were unhidden. He struck with three fists, multiplying his physical strength thrice. The fists shattered the void and struck the youth. Luo Tian's fists even showed fine cracks, as his current body could not withstand such pressure.

"Stop!" Master Ren Wuyue shouted, leaping toward the platform. However, Chen Baitian's face turned slightly cold and appeared before Master Ren Wuyue, blocking him.

"Crack..." Their domains collided. The domain surrounding Luo Tian shattered.

"Master Ren, youth is naturally impulsive," Chen Baitian smiled, addressing Master Ren Wuyue.

"Boom..." Three fists overlapped on the youth's body. Blood mist rose, and the youth was obliterated by Luo Tian's single punch.

"No..." Ren Qianxue's eyes were wild, gazing at the blood mist scattered on the platform. She flew toward Luo Tian standing on the platform.

"This body is still too weak to unleash full power," Luo Tian muttered, gazing at his blood-stained arms. The cracks slowly healed.

"You dare to murder your husband?" Luo Tian chuckled, gazing at Ren Qianxue close by. They locked eyes.

Only when Luo Tian pressed Ren Qianxue to the ground did people realize. Their faces showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian pressing Ren Qianxue.

"Three punches. Three punches to kill Luo Tian!" Kuang Fenghua gasped. Chen Tianxin's strength was evident, but three punches to kill Luo Tian seemed impossible.

"The top genius of the Middle Heaven must be Master Tianxin! Even Bai Tu from the White Family's First Heaven might not match!" People exclaimed, watching Luo Tian. The Flying Heaven Sect disciples went wild.

Luo Tian gazed at Ren Qianxue, whose eyes burned with fury. Their current position was quite intimate. Luo Tian's gaze met Ren Qianxue, whose image overlapped with Gu Qianxue. He couldn't help but kiss her cheek.

"You..." Ren Qianxue's eyes flashed shame, but Luo Tian held her tightly, preventing any movement.

"Pervert!" People's eyes showed oddity. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so bold.

"Master Tianxin!" Chen Baitian's face reddened, shouting. His heart also secretly rejoiced. He hadn't expected his son to have feelings.

"This is resolved!" Chen Baitian thought, fearing that Chen Tianxin disliked it. Now he realized his worry was unnecessary.

"I'll kill you!" Ren Qianxue shouted, her chest rising and falling rapidly. She spat blood, her body radiating madness.

"Damn!" Luo Tian felt Ren Qianxue's condition was wrong. He pressed an incantation, casting a hundred ghosts' seal into her body, sealing it. Luo Tian slowly stood up.

"Master Ren, I've killed your rebellious disciple for you. Don't thank me; it's because our Flying Heaven Sect has always had a tradition of doing good deeds!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Master Ren Wuyue. His heart felt relieved; he had long resented Fu Bei and now felt somewhat avenged.

Master Ren Wuyue's face turned red. He gazed at Luo Tian, his expression dark. His disciple had died, and anyone would feel pain.

However, Master Ren Wuyue hadn't expected that the one known for sleeping, Chen Tianxin, was so powerful. He had nearly annihilated his disciple.

"Father, avenge Master Luo!" Ren Qianxue stood up. Though her cultivation was sealed, she rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Sweetheart!" Luo Tian shamelessly grabbed Ren Qianxue in his arms. Her cultivation was sealed, so she couldn't resist.

"Ugh..." However, as Luo Tian embraced her, his shoulder suddenly ached. Ren Qianxue bit his shoulder. Luo Tian dared not resist, for if he did, with his current strength, he might shatter Ren Qianxue's teeth. Blood instantly stained Luo Tian's shoulder.

Luo Tian slapped Ren Qianxue's supple buttocks.

"If you don't let go, I won't be kind!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in Ren Qianxue's ear, his breath on her ear.

"Ugh..." Ren Qianxue didn't let go. The blood's scent filled her mouth.

"Don't blame me!" Luo Tian chuckled, lifting both hands to Ren Qianxue's armpits.

"Ugh..." The next moment, Ren Qianxue's body trembled violently. She immediately let go and pushed Luo Tian away, gazing at him.

"Indeed!" Luo Tian mused. Having been married to Gu Qianxue for years, he naturally knew her weakness—her fear of tickling.

"Haha, Master Ren, look how suitable the two children are! They're already like this!" Chen Baitian laughed heartily, his eyes filled with satisfaction. He almost cried, thinking Chen Tianxin had finally awakened.

"Never!" Ren Qianxue gritted her teeth, not continuing to attack. She now knew that if she continued attacking Luo Tian, it would be her own loss.

"Master Chen, let's discuss this further," Master Ren Wuyue spoke softly. He was quite complex now. Initially, he had thought Chen Tianxin wasn't suitable for Ren Qianxue and intended to cancel the match. However, with Chen Tianxin's current strength exceeding his expectations, he would consider it. After all, the Flying Heaven Sect was superior to their Flying Moon Sect.

"Since that's the case, we won't insist. Let Master Ren consider it further. However, let Master Qianxue stay with us for a while to foster their relationship!" Chen Baitian chuckled.

Upon hearing Chen Baitian's words, Master Ren Wuyue's face slightly changed. He knew Chen Baitian was taking a hostage. Chen Tianxin had killed Luo Tian, and Chen Baitian feared retaliation from Master Ren Wuyue.

"Father, I'll stay!" Before Master Ren Wuyue could speak, Ren Qianxue spoke. People were slightly stunned.

"Seize the opportunity for revenge!" Ren Qianxue's heart was clouded with hatred. If she left, revenge would be impossible. If she stayed here, there might still be an opportunity.

"Buzz..." As Ren Qianxue's words just fell, a vast vortex appeared in the sky of the Flying Heaven Sect.

The sound of breaking through the air rose. Black figures emerged from the vast vortex, standing in the sky above the Flying Heaven Sect.

Black figures like a dark cloud enveloped the Flying Heaven Mountain. The overwhelming pressure made all people on the mountain tremble.

"Who!" Chen Baitian's heart tightened. He gazed at the black-cloaked people, especially the leaders. Even as an Immortal King Early Stage, he felt pressure.

"The Flying Heaven Sect has a demon embryo. Hand it over; otherwise, we'll annihilate the sect!" A voice of authority echoed, making the Flying Heaven Sect's people sink.

"Buzz..." Thousands of black-cloaked figures continuously attacked, their divine laws wrapping the entire Flying Heaven Mountain.

Upon hearing the black-cloaked leader's words, Chen Baitian's heart tightened. He gazed at Chen Tianxin and then spoke: "We don't know what a demon embryo is. Who are you?"

"We are not your concern. If you don't hand it over, we'll erase the Flying Heaven Sect!" The black-cloaked leader coldly replied. He held a gray sword, slicing it.

"Buzz..." The gray blade split the heavens and earth, striking toward Chen Baitian's group.

The world thundered. Upon the appearance of the gray blade, Luo Tian felt an inability to resist it. Chen Baitian leaped up, holding a long sword and slicing.

"Crack..." The blade collided with the sword. A thunderous sound echoed. Chen Baitian spat blood, his body flying back but landing on the ground.

"Immortal King Mid-Stage!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed, gazing at the black-cloaked figure.

With the black-cloaked people's attacks, the battle began. Thousands of black-cloaked figures, their energy overwhelming. Their hands moved with incantations.

"Boom..." Great gray stones like meteors fell from the sky, crushing toward the Flying Heaven Sect.

"Kill..." Thousands of black-cloaked figures, though outnumbered by dozens times the Flying Heaven Sect, their strength was extraordinary. Five Immortal King Early Stage and two Immortal King Mid-Stage.

Boom, boom, boom...

Each stone with a world-destroying aura struck the Flying Heaven Mountain. A large number of Flying Heaven Sect disciples died instantly.

Black-cloaked figures descended from the sky, like tigers entering a sheepfold, beginning to brutally massacre the Flying Heaven Sect disciples.

"Ah..." In an instant, many Flying Heaven Sect disciples died. The black-cloaked figures had appeared too suddenly and were strong, with the weakest being True Immortal Mid-Stage. Many True Immortal Late Stage and Peak as well as nearly Immortal King were present.

Chapter 2318: Sacrificing the Body to the Demon

Chen Baitian roared, confronting an Immortal King Mid-Stage opponent. However, he was pushed back constantly with each confrontation, spitting blood heavily.

The strength difference was too great. The black-cloaked figures were like tigers entering a sheepfold, completely slaughtering.

"Why are we so unlucky!" Master Ren Wuyue roared. He hadn't expected to arrive here and witness such an event.

Master Ren Wuyue knew that the enemy had already attacked, making it impossible for them to leave alive. Thus, he chose to fight against them.

"Ah..." Roars echoed in the back mountains of the Flying Heaven Sect. A senior appeared instantly in the sky, his eyes filled with anger as he gazed at the black-cloaked figures. This was the Flying Heaven Sect's Grand Elder.

"Hand over the demon embryo!" An Immortal King Mid-Stage shouted, gazing at the Flying Heaven Sect's Grand Elder. He still didn't regard the Grand Elder as significant.

"Supreme King Domain!" Several Immortal King-level warriors's hands flowed with divine laws, their powerful waves emerging from the Immortal Kings' hands. They enveloped the Flying Heaven Mountain's barrier.

"Buzz..." Blades flashed, a world-destroying aura spreading from all sides of the Flying Heaven Sect. It formed terrifying swords, beginning to violently sweep across the Flying Heaven Mountain.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's face darkened. He pulled Ren Qianxue in front of him, not wanting to die here. At the same time, he released the seal on Ren Qianxue's body. After doing this, a wave of terrifying swords swept toward him. Luo Tian took out a long sword and blocked the blades.

"It's the Butan Sword Array! You're from Butan Mountain!"

"We've always been diligent, upholding the rules of the Middle Heaven. Why should we be annihilated!" The Flying Heaven Sect's Grand Elder roared, continuously fighting an Immortal King Mid-Stage opponent.

"Hand over the demon embryo. We'll let you live!" The black-cloaked figures' cold voice replied to the Grand Elder's words.

"We don't know what a demon embryo is!" Chen Baitian shouted, watching the Flying Heaven Sect disciples being slaughtered. He and Master Ren Wuyue fought an Immortal King Mid-Stage opponent but were still suppressed.

"We're from the Flying Moon Sect. This has nothing to do with us!" Master Ren Wuyue shouted, despairing in his final hope. He knew that if this continued, the entire Flying Heaven Sect would be annihilated, and he would die with it.

"Ten Thousand Dao of the Human Realm!" Luo Tian activated the Ten Thousand Dao of the Human Realm, reciting the蛮神战歌 (Martial God War Song) to empower Kuang Fenghua and others. However, it was still futile; the terrifying swords could penetrate through the Ten Thousand Dao of the Human Realm and strike everyone.

"Spit..." The youth resembling a sly assistant was struck in the waist by a sword, instantly severed at the waist.

"No..." Kuang Fenghua and others shouted. They watched the youth's death, wanting to fight but not knowing who to fight. Meanwhile, the black-cloaked figures brutally slaughtered the Flying Heaven Sect disciples. Especially the five Immortal King Early Stage, completely sweeping through with their domains, causing many Flying Heaven Sect disciples to fall.

Luo Tian stood in place, surrounded by Kuang Fenghua and others. Everyone was bloodied and couldn't withstand it. Any sword strike would result in severe injuries.

Luo Tian watched people around him falling one by one. Though he knew it was an illusion, seeing his companions die still caused him sorrow.

Helplessness, and a sense of helplessness against absolute strength.

Time passed. Five hours had elapsed. The slaughter continued. Finally, Ren Qianxue's figure fell beside Luo Tian, and he held her in his arms.

"Sorry!" Luo Tian muttered softly. At this moment, the surrounding was filled with corpses. He watched as he could barely hold on.

Blood stained Luo Tian's entire body. He gazed at the black-cloaked figures gathering together, as the Flying Heaven Sect had turned into a river of blood. Nearly four million disciples were dead, leaving few remaining.

"Boom..." A figure fell from the sky, crashing heavily into the ground. It was Chen Baitian.

The place where Chen Baitian fell had a woman lying there. It was Chen Tianxin's mother, but she was now lifeless.

"Cough... cough..." Chen Baitian's chest caved in, his body covered in blood. He lay beside the woman, eyes soft.

"I'm not willing!" Chen Baitian roared. Tears of blood flowed from his eyes. He desperately reached for his wife's hand, trying to grasp it but with no strength left. His vitality was continuously dissipating.

Luo Tian's face darkened, constantly breaking through waves of swords to reach Chen Baitian. He placed Chen Baitian's hand on his wife's.

"Live, no matter what it takes..." Chen Baitian saw Luo Tian approaching. He spoke as if he had regained his strength.

"Buzz..." At this moment, a black light appeared behind Luo Tian. It rushed toward him.

"Die!" Luo Tian suddenly turned, grabbing Chen Baitian's long sword and slicing at the black figure. He severed its neck, and the head flew, rolling on the ground.

"Since you say the Flying Heaven Sect has a demon embryo, I'll show you what it is!" The Grand Elder of the Flying Heaven Sect also had his limits. He was pushed back by an Immortal King Mid-Stage opponent, his body covered in wounds.

"Boom..." On the other side, Master Ren Wuyue was also pierced by an Immortal King Mid-Stage opponent and fell from the sky.

"Buzz..." A black divine light appeared in the sky. The Grand Elder of the Flying Heaven Sect held a black crystal, with dark energy swirling around it.

Luo Tian also saw the black crystal. His body trembled slightly, and a pulling force began to draw his soul.

"Huanmo Stone!" Luo Tian's heart suddenly understood. He felt the call of his true body.

"This place is indeed an illusion!" Luo Tian muttered, taking a deep breath. He feared he had been mistaken and that this was real, with his previous experiences being a dream.

In an instant, Luo Tian's soul left Chen Tianxin's body. He existed as a consciousness. At the same time, Chen Tianxin's body fell to the ground beside Chen Baitian and his wife.

"Indeed, there is a demon embryo!" The black-cloaked leader gazed at the black crystal. His eyes showed intense desire.

"Using my Immortal King's blood, I'll help you cross the demon path!" The Grand Elder of the Flying Heaven Sect showed madness. He spat blood, which splattered onto the black crystal.

As Luo Tian was stunned, the black crystal began to absorb the Grand Elder's blood. In an instant, the Grand Elder turned into a dry corpse, but his eyes remained bright.

"Demonic Heaven and Earth!" After this, the Grand Elder roared. His vitality began to dissipate.
