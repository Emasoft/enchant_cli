However, Gu Qianxue dared not move. After all, Luotian was now the master of this graveyard. Though she had some hidden cards, she could not match the ghost king who was nearly a true immortal.

"Go," Luotian spoke softly, "though I do not know what this head-of-ghost sword is, it must be important to you!" He did not pay attention to Gu Qianxue but ordered Yu Changtian to lift the unconscious Sun Kemin and ride upon the massive body of the three-headed dog, heading toward the thatched hut.

"This..." Upon hearing Luotian's words, Gu Qianxue's heart trembled. A trickle of blood flowed from her lips as waves of black qi erupted from her body, but she directed them toward the spirit of the head-of-ghost sword.

Chapter 1830: Ghost King

"Sun Kemin!" Luotian roared, dodging the black sword slashes repeatedly. He did not know what Sun Kemin was up to.

"You came to die! That sword is not so easily obtained!" Gu Qianxue roared, dodging the black slashes as well.

"Growl..." As Luotian and Gu Qianxue spoke, the ground of the tomb finally cracked open. A black hand emerged from the grave, causing Luotian and Yu Changtian's faces to pale.

"What is this?" They both leapt into action, rushing toward Sun Kemin's direction to subdue him first.

But Sun Kemin was unusually brave, wielding the head-of-ghost sword with fierce momentum. Each slash radiated terrifying power, pressing heavily on Luotian and Yu Changtian.

Meanwhile, a black figure also crawled out of the graveyard, appearing before Luotian's group. A powerful aura spread across heaven and earth, even making the four heavenly immortal peak-level ghost creatures subdued by Gu Qianxue tremble.

"True Immortal's Power!" Luotian punched Sun Kemin back, his lips twitching as he gazed at the black humanoid ghost.

"This is a ghost king, but it hasn't fully evolved yet. Its strength is nearly that of a true immortal, but only one step away from breaking through to true immortality. Thus, it can unleash part of a true immortal's power!" Gu Qianxue explained to Luotian.

"What the hell is this thing?" Luotian trembled, feeling fear from that true immortal's aura.

"That ghost weapon is what subdued this ghost king. Your bastard friend took it, releasing this ghost king!" Gu Qianxue shouted, finally showing urgency. A nearly true immortal ghost king was beyond her power; they would all die otherwise.

"Idiotic teammates! When will this bastard fix his flaw!" Luotian cursed, slapping Sun Kemin's face hard, sending him flying back.

In the next moment, the ghost king nearly at true immortal level moved, its black hand clenching as if gripping a sword.

"Clang..." As the ghost king clenched its hand, Sun Kemin's head-of-ghost sword trembled violently. The iron rings on the blade clashed against its back, as if trying to break free from Sun Kemin's grip.

"Do not let that sword fall into the ghost king's hands! If he gets it, this ghost king will break through to true immortality and gain sentience. Then we'll all die!" Gu Qianxue shouted.

"You handle Sun Kemin, I'll disrupt that one!" Before Gu Qianxue's words finished, Luotian had already assigned the plan and addressed Yu Changtian.

"Good!" Yu Changtian was clearly no ordinary person. Upon hearing Luotian's words, he waved his hands, and two water dragons burst forth from his palms, entwining Sun Kemin and the head-of-ghost sword.

Meanwhile, Luotian's lips twitched as he rushed toward the ghost king. With a single step, he unleashed his renowned "Martial Seven Stomp."

"Growl..." Though the ghost king's mind was not fully intact, it conveyed a sense of disdain. Its black fist swung toward Luotian's foot.

"Crack..." Next, a breaking sound rose from Luotian's leg. His golden leg image collapsed instantly, and he flew backward like an arrow.

"Boom..." Blood spewed from Luotian's mouth as he collided with tomb after tomb, flying back a hundred feet before finally landing on the ground in a miserable heap.

"My leg is broken... my internal organs are also severely injured. The gap is too great!" Luotian's face showed a bitter smile. Only because of his thick skin could he survive; an ordinary heavenly immortal early-stage or mid-stage would have been crushed by that ghost king's fist.

"Growl..." The ghost king, seeing Luotian still alive, roared angrily, furious at having failed to kill this weak ant.

"Buzz..." Next, the ghost king raised its hand high and made a sword-raising gesture. However, the head-of-ghost sword still trembled, trapped with Sun Kemin by Yu Changtian's grip.

Even without the sword, a blade aura still emerged from the ghost king—more accurately, a terrifying blade intent.

"This is truly over!" Luotian gazed at the descending sword slash, a bitter smile on his face. He felt that no matter how many methods he had, they were useless against absolute strength.

"Despair... I haven't felt this in thousands of years, but the gap is too vast!" Luotian's face showed a bitter smile.

As Luotian smiled, the terrifying blade intent sliced through the black sky and appeared before him. Even Luotian had no time to react, instinctively raising his arm. But he knew it was futile; he would inevitably become the ghost king's victim.

"Finished..." Yu Changtian's face showed a bitter smile, and Gu Qianxue's eyes flickered as she severed the four black ghost qi, preparing to flee.

"Crash..." However, a thunderous sound erupted next, as if something had shattered. There was no sight of Luotian being split in two.

"Cough... cough..." Luotian spat blood, his eyes filled with disbelief. His entire arm had been severed but still blocked the ghost king's attack.

"Clang..." Next, a crisp sound echoed, making Luotian instantly realize what had saved him: the collar of the Hell's Three-Headed Dog, which had remained within it since its seal was placed. Luotian had worn it on his hand all along.

"Black!" Luotian roared, fearing the collar's connection with the three-headed dog. He was worried that if it shattered, the three-headed dog might cause problems.

"Growl..." However, Luotian soon realized his worry was unnecessary. A deep growl echoed beneath him, shaking the earth.

Next, black qi spread, interwoven with lightning. A massive black creature appeared before Luotian, its three enormous heads unmistakable, their icy fangs glowing with a cold light that illuminated the darkness.

The three heads howled upward, shaking heaven and earth. An invisible aura radiated from its massive body. More terrifying still, the moment this creature appeared, all the ghost creatures in the Tianlong Tomb trembled. Their gazes turned toward Luotian's direction, including the four heavenly immortal peak-level ghosts and even the ghost king that had nearly killed Luotian.

"Black!" Luotian gazed at the massive creature, his own aura making even him wary.

"Woof..." The three-headed dog responded to Luotian's call, barking three times before gently licking his body.

"Take them and run quickly!" Luotian grabbed a pill, forcing it into his mouth to maintain strength. He addressed the three-headed dog, though he knew it was no match for the ghost king.

"Growl..." However, the three-headed dog let out a low growl, its eyes flashing with fierce anger upon seeing Luotian's broken leg and arm. The three massive heads turned toward the ghost king, then howled again.

"Buzz..." An invisible vortex emerged from the three-headed dog's mouths, spreading outward.

"Ahh..." As the three-headed dog roared, even the nearly true immortal ghost king trembled. Black qi enveloped it, drawn into the invisible vortex. The four heavenly immortal peak-level ghosts also trembled, their power diminishing as they begged for mercy.

"Reaper! Compared to the Ghost-Controlling Seal, black is the greatest weakness of these ghosts!" Luotian's heart trembled. He hadn't expected such a reversal.

"Helldog, the ruler of hell, feeding on countless evil spirits!" Gu Qianxue's eyes were equally stunned. She hadn't expected Luotian to possess such a creature.

"Black..." Luotian's eyes brightened, quickly stopping the three-headed dog. After all, a nearly true immortal was rare across the lower three realms. If used properly, it would be an immense asset.

"Growl..." Upon hearing Luotian's words, the three-headed dog's silver eyes flashed with confusion but stopped. It growled toward the ghost king.

The ghost king clearly possessed some intelligence, as did the four heavenly immortal peak-level ghosts. They all knelt before the three-headed dog, submitting.

"Let them go!" Luotian saw this scene and addressed the three-headed dog.

With the three-headed dog present, even a ghost king and four heavenly immortal peak-level ghosts stood up slowly, dazedly standing there. They exhaled black qi, which was absorbed into Luotian's Ghost-Controlling Seal. A strange connection instantly spread through Luotian's mind, making his face light up with joy. After those black qi entered the Ghost-Controlling Seal, it immediately surged to a high-level state.

"If I had known you were this变态, I would have awakened you directly!" Luotian smiled.

The three-headed dog opened its mouth again, sucking in the head-of-ghost sword that Yu Changtian had restrained. Black qi also escaped from Sun Kemin's body, forming a black shadow.

"Spirit!" Gu Qianxue's face showed excitement. If this spirit was subdued, it would naturally become the head-of-ghost sword's master.

However, Gu Qianxue dared not move. After all, Luotian was now the master of this graveyard. Though she had some hidden cards, she could not match a nearly true immortal ghost king.

"Go," Luotian spoke softly, "though I do not know what this head-of-ghost sword is, it must be important to you!" He did not pay attention to Gu Qianxue but ordered Yu Changtian to lift the unconscious Sun Kemin and ride upon the three-headed dog's massive body toward the thatched hut.

"This..." Upon hearing Luotian's words, Gu Qianxue's heart trembled. A trickle of blood flowed from her lips as waves of black qi erupted from her body, but she directed them toward the head-of-ghost sword's spirit.

Chapter 1831: The Trial of Outer Sect Disciples

Morning sunlight fell, adding a touch of warmth to the ominous place. Yet Gu Qianxue in black attire cast an additional layer of frost over her surroundings. A black head-of-ghost sword hovered above her, emitting waves of dark qi.

"Who is he?" Her eyes opened, and her red lips parted as she whispered to herself. She reached out, grasping the head-of-ghost sword in her hand.

"Blade of Soul-Cutting, a treasure of hell. I never expected it to fall into my hands!" Gu Qianxue caressed the blade's surface, murmuring softly. "Considering you saved me this time, I'll let you go!"

Gu Qianxue's words, her figure flickered as she collected the head-of-ghost sword and vanished into the graveyard.

Half an hour after Gu Qianxue left, a figure appeared in the graveyard. An angry voice echoed through Tianlong Tomb: "Who took the Blade of Soul-Cutting!"

The words faded, and a gust of wind blew. A shadow disappeared from Tianlong Tomb.

...

"Ha..." On the other side, in a dilapidated thatched hut, Sun Kemin slowly sat up. He stretched his arms and yawned before seeing several eyes staring at him, causing his face to change.

"Ahh..." Next, Sun Kemin screamed louder, feeling his bare body—only wearing a pair of underwear.

"What happened? Where are my things? What's going on? Where am I?" Sun Kemin stood up immediately.

"Early morning, you're yapping so much?" Luotian lay there, scolding him. Seeing this fat man, Luotian's anger flared. If it weren't for this bastard, he wouldn't be in such a state now—nearly killed by the ghost king.

"Luotian, what's wrong with you?" Sun Kemin looked at Luotian's pale face, his eyes filled with confusion.

"You damned bastard! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be like this! I took your treasures and considered them my spiritual loss!" Luotian shouted.

"Don't be ridiculous! I did nothing, and you even hit me from behind before! Now you're openly robbing me!" Sun Kemin's face immediately showed resistance.

"You don't know what you did yesterday!" Luotian coughed twice, then had Yu Changtian recount the events of the previous day.

"Uh..." Sun Kemin's fat face turned red and pale alternately, but his skin was thick. He then licked his lips and spoke to Luotian: "Luotian, I did it unintentionally. Look, can you return some to me? It's not easy for me to have this little wealth!"

"Go away..." Luotian instinctively kicked out a foot, but he gasped in pain. He had lost one leg.

"Damn it!" Luotian cursed inwardly. This was the worst injury he had suffered since entering the immortal realm. Though he had pills, it wouldn't heal in a short time. Not only was his leg and arm broken, but his internal organs were also injured. Otherwise, he could have recovered with pills in a moment.

"Luotian, I'll give you an inferior immortal artifact!"

"No! Go away and don't bother me while I recover!" Sun Kemin was persistent, and Luotian didn't back down.

Yu Changtian watched in disbelief, surprised that the two men were arguing so fiercely their faces turned red.

"Luotian, don't push it too far. Look at your condition. Don't force me to use power!" After arguing, Sun Kemin shouted angrily. After all, Luotian was in such a state now; he could easily take it by force. This thought came to his mind, and Sun Kemin's eyes glowed with a sly light.

"Robbing Luotian, hahaha! If those bastards knew, they'd admire themselves!" Sun Kemin's mind was already fantasizing, his face showing a lecherous smile.

"Are you sure?" Seeing Sun Kemin's smile, Luotian knew he was up to no good. He smiled slightly and addressed Sun Kemin.

"Uh?" Sun Kemin saw Luotian's smile, instinctively shivered. He remembered that Luotian had never lost before.

"Deceiving me, you must be deceiving me!" But soon Sun Kemin seemed to have oil in his heart, thinking Luotian was lying.

"Of course!" Sun Kemin rubbed his hands, scanning Luotian's body, thinking about where to start. After all, this was a long-faced job.

"Alright!" Luotian sighed deeply and spoke outside the courtyard: "Black, Qing, bite this bastard, bite him hard!"

"Woof... Woof..." As Luotian's words finished, two figures—black and blue—rushed into the house. They stared at Sun Kemin with fierce eyes, which were the three-headed dog and the Howling Moon Wolf King. In one night, the Howling Moon Wolf King had learned to bark like a dog from the three-headed dog.

"Shit..." Sun Kemin saw the two creatures staring at him fiercely, especially seeing their sharp fangs. He immediately wet his pants.

"Luotian, we can talk things over..."

"Bit him!"

"Woof... Woof..." Next, before Sun Kemin could finish speaking, Luotian interrupted him. Two figures rushed toward Sun Kemin.

"I'm sorry!" Sun Kemin immediately jumped up and ran out of the thatched hut, his agonized voice echoing inside.

"Quiet!" Luotian smiled, gazing at Yu Changtian.

Yu Changtian was speechless but felt a strange sense, a brotherly bond.

Time passed slowly. Three days had gone by, and Luotian's injuries were completely healed. He stepped out of the courtyard, stretching his body.

"Woof... Woof..." In Tianlong Tomb, chaos reigned. A white fat man, wearing only underwear, was covered in bite marks and ran barefoot. If anyone came, they would think this fat man was a pervert.

"Senior Tian, Senior Lord, I truly regret it! I'll never do it again!" Sun Kemin saw Luotian walking out and rushed to his front, eyes filled with entreaty. He panted heavily.

"Still want to rob me?" Luotian sneered but then frowned, waving his hand and recalling the three-headed dog and Howling Moon Wolf King. He tossed Sun Kemin a piece of clothing.

"Go inside, someone's coming!" Luotian spoke softly to Sun Kemin and kicked him into the thatched hut.

After doing this, Luotian's eyes had a hint of black qi, appearing hazy. He gazed at the courtyard outside.

At the same time, a figure even fatter than Sun Kemin appeared at the courtyard's entrance—Master Zhu Youde of the Outer Sect.

"Junior Brother Lu!" Zhu Youde saw Luotian's hazy eyes and felt happy.

"This kid clearly went mad; he couldn't even wait for a moment," Zhu Youde thought, recalling that yesterday Zhao Ritian and Zhu Fengtian had found him and given him orders.

"Senior Brother Zhu..." Luotian spoke with a confused tone, gazing at Zhu Youde. His voice had no emotion.

"Junior Brother Lu, you've suffered. But from now on, you don't need to endure this anymore. You can leave here!" Zhu Youde smiled.

"Really?" Upon hearing Zhu Youde's words, Luotian's black eyes brightened. He secretly thought Zhu Youde had come at the perfect time. His goal in Tianlong Tomb was achieved, and he wanted to leave here.

"Yes, Junior Brother Lu, all disciples entering the Outer Sect must complete a trial. You are no exception. Therefore, you must participate in the Outer Sect Disciple's Trial!" Zhu Youde's eyes carried a sense of condescension.

"Another trick!" Luotian thought coldly but showed gratitude in his eyes, secretly calculating whether to let Zuo Qiuming directly declare him an Inner Sect disciple.

"The trial is as follows: A few days ago, a message came that another sect discovered an ascended person and offered them to our Tianlong Sect. Our Tianlong Sect needs people to escort this ascended person back. This is a good mission, and that's why I thought of Junior Brother Lu!" Zhu Youde said, crossing his arms.

"Thank you, Senior Brother... Thank you, Senior Brother..." Luotian quickly showed gratitude and spoke to Zhu Youde. If there was a trace of an ascended person, Luotian would not miss it. If it were his friend, he would definitely try to save them.

"Pack up, I'll take you tomorrow!" Zhu Youde finished and swayed his hips, which looked like it wanted to be kicked. He knew he might not see Luotian again from tomorrow.

"Whether it's a mountain of blades or a cauldron of oil, I must go through them!" Luotian's eyes showed depth. Though he knew this was likely a trap set by Zhu Youde with someone else, he had no choice but to go. Though the ascended person might not be from Jiuyu, if it were a Jiuyu person, Luotian wouldn't go, and the Tianlong Sect disciples would bring them back. Then that person would become the next Sun Kemin.

"Luotian!" Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian walked out, their eyes filled with concern. They couldn't accompany Luotian.

"Wait, I'll send you two to Master Xue's place. The time for the pill competition is approaching, and I'll try to return before two months!" Luotian spoke seriously. He was worried about Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian's safety; he didn't know how long this trip would take.

"Uh!" Yu Changtian and Sun Kemin both sighed deeply. The feeling of not controlling their lives was uncomfortable.

Chapter 1832: Ruan Xingyu

After discussing for a while, Luotian led Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian to the peak. However, Zuo Qiuming was not there; only Xue Changfeng remained.

"The time is still early, why did you bring them here?" Xue Changfeng frowned slightly, gazing at Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian. He also sighed inwardly; the ascended person's growth was truly fast. When he arrived, this fat man was at the Daoist Stage, but now he had broken through to the Heavenly Immortal Stage. The other one was about to break through to the mid-Heavenly Immortal Stage.

"Senior, I need to participate in the Outer Sect Trial Task, so I've brought them back here. I hope you can take care of their safety. Also, do you know how the sect handles them?" Luotian spoke seriously. After so long, the sect's elders might have decided Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian's fate.

"Yes, after bringing back the chaos sect ascended person, we'll send them to the Middle Three Realms. There, there are people sent by the Eternal Life Immortal King." Xue Changshan spoke, gazing at Luotian.

"Then who is assigned to escort them?" Luotian thought for a while, the worst-case scenario being that Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian would be kidnapped during the escort.

"It's likely one of the top three disciples on the Tianlong Rankings. This is a major achievement, and the sect hopes these people will be noticed when they arrive in the Middle Three Realms. That way, it would benefit the Tianlong Sect. If they are noticed by the Eternal Life Immortal King's people, it would be even better!" Xue Changshan sighed softly. It was clear that Luotian's chance of saving Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian was as difficult as climbing a mountain.

"Of course, this is just the surface. In reality, we old men might also have one secretly following." Xue Changshan spoke again, making Luotian's heart jump.

"If it were those three elites or even Zuo Qiuming, Luotian had a way to escape. But if it were Xue Changshan, an old monster, Luotian would have no solution. To snatch people from a true immortal early-stage old monster, even if he used all his cards, he might have only a slight chance. It was too difficult."

"Chaos Sect?" Luotian also noticed Xue Changshan's mention of another place, the Chaos Sect that had offered an ascended person to the Tianlong Sect.

"Coincidence?" Luotian's eyes showed depth, his aura turning icy. Even Xue Changshan felt the hall had become colder.

"Is there anything I can help with? Except for these two, I can't protect them. Other matters are no problem!" Xue Changshan spoke softly.

"You've already troubled the senior too much. I'll handle it myself!" Luotian showed respect, then instructed Sun Kemin not to cause trouble before leaving the peak.

After exiting the peak, Luotian didn't return to the Outer Sect but continued walking toward the most desolate mountain peak of the Tianlong Sect—once one of the nine peaks, He Peak.

At that time, He Peak was unusually quiet. On its massive peak stood only about a hundred people, and they all seemed to be new disciples.

"Who are you?" As Luotian arrived at the foot of the mountain, a shout echoed from the gate.

"Uh..." Luotian was stunned. The person who stopped him was someone he recognized—Yu Haonan, who had previously been kicked and then healed by Luotian.

However, now Yu Haonan had joined the Inner Sect and didn't recognize Luotian. Thus, he shouted at him.

"Luotian, I came to find Elder Zuo for something!" Luotian smiled slightly, gazing at Yu Haonan's fierce face.

"Elder Zuo? Good kid, what are you? You dare call our peak leader Elder Zuo. I think you're here to cause trouble, bullying us from He Peak!" Yu Haonan roared.

"..." Luotian was speechless, watching Yu Haonan's red face. But he heard the anger in Yu Haonan's voice, clearly indicating that Elder Zuo Qiming wanted to revitalize He Peak but faced some resistance.

After all, He Peak now had only Elder Zuo Qiming left without a true immortal strength. And after years of abandonment, developing it was not easy.

"Luotian!" As Yu Haonan roared, Elder Zuo Qiming came down the mountain with a happy face.

"Uh? Luotian? Oh my god, you're that Luotian?" Yu Haonan suddenly remembered something and gazed at Luotian with disbelief.

"Renowned!" Yu Haonan could only describe Luotian's name as renowned, for it was a being with soul cultivation surpassing the Xuan Dan.

"Senior Brother!" Luotian smiled, seeing Elder Zuo Qiming coming down. He saw the fatigue on Elder Zuo Qiming's face.

"Yu Haonan, this is my sworn brother. You dare to block him!" Elder Zuo Qiming scolded Yu Haonan.

"Senior Brother, I didn't know, so it's not my fault. This kid is a talent, though he has a hot temper!" Luotian spoke softly, acting old and wise, making Yu Haonan uncomfortable.

"A heavenly immortal early-stage person dares to call me kid. That's really shameless..." Yu Haonan muttered, his eyes showing defiance. Though Luotian had good talent, his strength was only early-stage heavenly immortal, while Yu Haonan was mid-stage.

"Come..." Elder Zuo Qiming pulled Luotian warmly into a grand hall. Though the hall was magnificent, it was unusually quiet, with no disciples inside.

"Senior Brother, your place is really bare!" Luotian smiled lightly, gazing at Elder Zuo Qiming.

"Don't mock me, Senior Brother. You don't know how it was when I first returned here. These one hundred people were all arranged by me. After all, He Peak is no longer what it used to be!" Elder Zuo Qiming smiled lightly.

"When I return from this trial, I'll help you find a solution. Do you welcome me joining He Peak?" Luotian smiled lightly. Elder Zuo Qiming and Xue Changshan had treated him well, so Luotian would repay their kindness.

"Of course!" Upon hearing Luotian's words, Elder Zuo Qiming's eyes brightened. If Luotian joined He Peak, it would be a strong tonic for He Peak. After all, the光环 on Luotian's head was too great.

"Trial?" But then Elder Zuo Qiming thought of Luotian's mention of the trial and frowned slightly.

"Senior Brother, why participate in a trial? I still have my Inner Sect disciple's spot. I haven't used it yet!" Elder Zuo Qiming spoke loudly, not wanting Luotian to participate in this trial. He also knew that this trial was going to the Chaos Sect, and he had a bad relationship with Yao Qishui and Wang Tianlong from before.

"Senior Brother, don't say more. I have my own confidence. I came here to say goodbye. The Outer Sect matters are all handled. After returning, I'll enter He Peak!" Luotian shook his head lightly and spoke to Elder Zuo Qiming.

"Okay, then!" Elder Zuo Qiming nodded. He trusted Luotian's judgment since he was always reasonable.

"Then I'll take my leave!" Luotian spoke for a while with Elder Zuo Qiming before standing up and leaving the hall. Elder Zuo Qiming also accompanied him out.

But as Luotian was less than a thousand feet from He Peak's gate, the sound of commotion made his eyebrows twitch.

"Ah, He Peak's disciples are now few and weak. These days, other peaks' disciples often come to provoke us. As the peak leader, I can't attack them. And He Peak's strongest is you just saw—Yu Haonan. Therefore, these days, He Peak has been very depressed. Even the one hundred plus people who joined He Peak have some wanting to leave and join other peaks!" Elder Zuo Qiming's voice, filled with bitterness, echoed behind Luotian.

"Don't worry, Senior Brother. It'll get better. Since I'm here, I'll help you solve the current problems first!" Luotian patted Elder Zuo Qiming's shoulder and walked toward where the crowd gathered.

"Then I'll leave it to you!" Elder Zuo Qiming smiled, since he had never been disappointed by Luotian. After saying this, even Elder Zuo Qiming who intended to manage it himself turned around and walked up the mountain.

"Haha, Yu Haonan! You're such a bastard that you can't even become He Peak's top disciple. You and your trash occupy so much space, don't you feel ashamed?"

"Yes! Previously, He Peak had no one. It was all ours!" Luotian hadn't even reached the place yet when he heard a series of scoldings.

Two groups faced off, about two to three hundred people. Yu Haonan led He Peak's disciples, their faces red as they stood there. They were surrounded by a group of people, and the leader was a young disciple with mid-stage heavenly immortal power. He wore white robes, his hair disheveled, and his back had some grace but his face was unattractive—his nose was upturned with a wide mouth like a sausage.

"It's impossible! The peak leader treated me well, I would never betray Elder Zuo!" Yu Haonan's face was bruised. He gazed at the young man.

Ruan Xingyu, a disciple of Person Peak, ranked twelfth on the Tianlong Battle Rankings. He was mid-stage heavenly immortal. His brother Ruan Xinghe ranked second on the Tianlong Battle Rankings. The two brothers dominated the Inner Sect of Tianlong Sect, except for the top-ranked person and some elders. No one dared to defy Ruan Xinghe's authority.

"You're nothing! Person Peak is nothing! In less than ten years, He Peak will surely become the first peak of Tianlong Sect!" As people were tense, Luotian's cold voice echoed in their ears.

"Who! Daring to speak so boldly!" Upon hearing Luotian's words, Ruan Xingyu's face turned dark. He gazed at the source of the voice.

"Haha, I thought it was Elder Zuo, but it's just a young kid!" Ruan Xingyu saw Luotian and laughed scornfully.

"Who is this kid? Is he a new disciple of He Peak?" Ruan Xingyu looked at Luotian and asked Yu Haonan.

"What are you doing here?" Yu Haonan frowned, but his wound pulled, making his face twitch.

"Nothing, just passing by. I came to check it out!" Luotian was placed among the crowd. He smiled, scanning Yu Haonan's face before his eyes turned icy.

"Did they beat you?" Luotian asked, though Yu Haonan was mid-stage heavenly immortal, the aura on Luotian's body was not something anyone could possess. It was an aura of long years of controlling others' lives, which even the sect's master Li Changfeng hadn't possessed.

"Yes..." Yu Haonan, intimidated by Luotian's aura, nodded immediately. His mind was puzzled—why did he feel this way toward a heavenly immortal early-stage person?

"Kid, you're really bold!" Ruan Xingyu quickly recovered from his state and gazed at Luotian. As someone who had stood out in the Inner Sect of Tianlong, Ruan Xingyu was no ordinary person. He immediately sensed Luotian's uniqueness.

"Used to it..." Luotian shrugged, though facing a mid-stage heavenly immortal and a strong one. However, Luotian had made great progress now; he was just one step away from mid-stage.

"I like your boldness. Give you a chance—join my Person Peak. From now on, I'll take you to show off and fly in Tianlong Sect. Except for me and my brother, no one can touch you!"

"What you need to do is be my dog, a loyal dog!" Ruan Xingyu smiled, he loved suppressing such talents like Luotian, making them grovel at his feet.

"I'll help you fight back!" Luotian seemed not to have heard Ruan Xingyu's words and spoke to Yu Haonan.

"Rumors..." The crowd erupted, then laughter broke out. They all laughed at Luotian, thinking he was too naive to know his place—a heavenly immortal early-stage person daring to fight a mid-stage one. No one would believe that.

"Kid, I'm standing here. Can you hit me?" Ruan Xingyu laughed arrogantly. He had met arrogant people before, but he had never seen someone as bold as Luotian.
