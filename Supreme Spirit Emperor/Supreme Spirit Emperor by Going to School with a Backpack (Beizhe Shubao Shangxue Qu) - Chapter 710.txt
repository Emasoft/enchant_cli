“Do you understand?” Hearing the man’s shout, Sun Kelnian retaliated instantly, his gaze filled with disdain as he looked at the elder of the Xian Wang Mid-Stage.

“I don’t!” The elder shook his head, his gaze fixed on Sun Kelnian.

“If you don’t understand, then stay quiet. This coffin can only be opened by us; few others could manage it. If you keep pushing, I won’t open it!” Sun Kelnian sneered, watching the elder.

“You…” The elder’s gaze flicked toward Sun Kelnian, ready to retaliate, but upon recalling Sun Kelnian’s words.

“What? Disobedient? Then we won’t open it!” Sun Kelnian sneered again. If not for Luotian’s urgency, he wouldn’t have wanted to open the coffin now. They could wait until no one was around and then open it—how pleasant it would be to claim whatever lay inside.

To miss an opportunity was a loss. Now, opening the coffin had already put Sun Kelnian and his companions in a bad mood. The elder’s provocation was like walking into the gun’s path.

“I don’t want to see him; let him leave!” Zhang Chenglong’s face darkened, ordering the elder to depart.

The elder’s face flushed red, his gaze sweeping over others—everyone wore hostile expressions, even the Holy Prince of the Taiping Sect, Li Yuqing, was watching him.

“Will you leave on your own or should we escort you?” Ye Qiu snorted, causing the elder to startle. Others also wore hostile expressions.

“Fine!” The elder nodded, glaring fiercely at Sun Kelnian before turning and leaving.

“That’s better!” Sun Kelnian’s face bore a triumphant grin, his gaze returning to the coffin. He exchanged glances with Sima Tuo and Zhang Chenglong.

“We need treasures—nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons!”

“If you don’t have them, we can’t open it,” Sun Kelnian addressed the crowd.

“What?” Upon hearing Sun Kelnian’s words, everyone was taken aback; they hadn’t expected the price to be so high.

Luotian inwardly cursed, suspecting these three were exploiting the situation to extort. However, he didn’t stop them; he was too lazy for tasks without benefit.

“Fine,” Ye Qiu nodded, raising his hand. A Upper-Grade Ghost Weapon sword flew from his palm.

One Upper-Grade Ghost Weapon was considered valuable, though not excessively so; it still made people wince.

Wang Xiu, Tian Baiguang, and Li Yuqing also each produced a Upper-Grade Ghost Weapon, handing them to Sun Kelnian.

After receiving the rewards, Zhang Chenglong and his disciples’ expressions improved slightly. They leapt into the air, landing atop the ancient coffin.

They bit their fingers, drawing blood to inscribe strange spiritual symbols onto the coffin. The blood transformed into eerie script imprints on the coffin’s surface.

After a hundred breaths, they completed the inscriptions and placed the nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons at the coffin’s nine positions, each also stained with their blood.

After finishing this, they stood atop the coffin, each placing a spiritual talisman on it. The script inscribed with their blood instantly moved, forming nine spiritual dragon-like symbols that coiled around the nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons.

*Buzz…*

The nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons instantly emitted a clamor, radiating an overwhelming aura. They flew from the coffin.

It seemed as if the nine weapons were pulling at the coffin, causing it to tremble. Under everyone’s astonished gaze, Huangquan’s coffin lid finally moved, pulled open with a crack. As the lid gradually lifted, a surge of overwhelming energy burst forth, sweeping across eight directions, making Luotian and others frown in solemnity.

Chapter 2674: Residual Soul of Huangquan ()

Above the Huangquan Coffin, the nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons emitted a clamor. However, Luotian and others clearly felt their energy was weakening.

“Did you think we wanted your things? It takes nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons to briefly open this coffin lid!” Sun Kelnian shouted, his expression grave as he gazed into the Huangquan Coffin.

“What is this?” Upon seeing what lay within the coffin, everyone—including Luotian—was stunned.

A towering aura of imperial power surrounded a figure lying flat, eyes closed, its flesh radiating an astonishing fluctuation. Though lifeless, it still commanded reverence.

The man was in his middle years, wearing a yellow robe adorned with ancient patterns—three fierce beasts, the three totems of Hell.

The yellow robe was as ominous as Huangquan itself; it was clearly no ordinary item. Most astonishing of all were the ten gray figures surrounding the fleshly body.

Ten gray figures, each radiating formidable power, clashed fiercely within the vast coffin.

“Someone’s coming!” As the lid was lifted, the ten gray figures halted, spotting Luotian and others within the coffin.

What stunned them most was that all ten figures looked identical, as if carved from a mold—only their expressions varied slightly.

“Hurry in! The nine ghost weapons can’t hold out much longer!” Sun Kelnian shouted, watching the nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons gradually dimming.

“Enter or not?” The group hesitated, for if they entered, they might never return. Yet if they didn’t, they would miss the greatest opportunity here.

“Enter!” Before anyone could react, the ten souls shouted in unison. Almost simultaneously, they opened their mouths and unleashed a violent suction force, pulling everyone toward the coffin.

Imperial might was overwhelming; resistance was futile. In an instant, Luotian and others were forcibly pulled into the coffin. At the same time, the nine Upper-Grade Ghost Weapons that had been pulling the lid fell onto it, losing their divine essence.

Inside the spacious coffin, they stood without darkness; the entire space was filled with faint yellow light. The source of this glow was a single oil lamp above their heads.

“Huangquan Lamp!” Someone gasped, gazing at the oil lamp with greed in their eyes.

“Huangquan has three treasures: the Huangquan Lamp, the Huangquan Sword, and the Huangquan Ruler! Each is immensely powerful. Among them, the Huangquan Lamp is strongest because its base contains a world heart!” Ye Qiu spoke, his eyes also alight with excitement.

“These people are truly greedy,” the ten gray figures said, watching everyone fixate on the Huangquan Lamp and the Huangquan Sword beside the fleshly body. They let out a low sigh.

In an instant, the ten figures soared into the air, rushing toward Luotian’s group.

*Boom, boom, boom…*

The ten figures transformed into gray mist, spreading before the group. Luotian’s face slightly changed.

“Block your senses; don’t give them a chance!” Luotian transmitted mentally to Diao Dezhu and Sun Kelnian.

Upon hearing Luotian’s transmission, Zhang Chenglong, Sun Kelnian, and Sima Tuo obeyed instantly. After all, they had long traversed great tombs and were experienced.

However, Diao Dezhu and others weren’t so fortunate; the gray mist infiltrated Diao Dezhu’s body without resistance.

Ye Qiu, Wang Xiu, and others were also infiltrated by the gray mist, their eyes turning murky.

“Excellent flesh!” Ye Qiu and others spoke, their faces displaying strange expressions.

Only one gray figure appeared before Luotian, its gaze complex as it looked at him.

“Huangquan Brother?” Luotian gazed at the familiar figure before him—none other than the former Ghost King Huangquan.

“It’s me. I need your help!” The gray figure nodded, not refuting. Its gray eyes also carried a sense of melancholy.

“Why didn’t you reveal yourself directly?” Luotian asked, even if Huangquan had appeared personally, he would have aided him.

“Not the time to explain. Those few are like me—residual souls. We were split apart for unknown reasons; I only gained some memories later.”

“Three souls and seven essences—ten residual souls, we all arrived here at the same time. Our goal is to vie for the flesh and merge with other residual souls.”

“In short, it’s a battle for names. The victor becomes the true Huangquan; the loser will be completely scattered and absorbed!” Huangquan spoke to Luotian, accurately—Huangquan’s residual soul.

“Kill…” As the two conversed, Diao Dezhu’s eyes glowed with gray light, rushing toward Luotian. His expression was fierce and grotesque.

“Residual souls have lost their control, so they can’t possess a host; they can only briefly occupy one,” Luotian’s face showed understanding. These residual souls aimed to control others through another method of resistance.

“Big brother, you’ve found the right person!” Luotian smiled, stepping forward and grabbing Diao Dezhu.

*Boom…*

A dull sound echoed, Luotian retreating two steps, his eyes filled with surprise. He hadn’t expected Diao Dezhu, now controlled, to be so strong—enough to push him back.

“Just a few residual souls; I won’t let them get away with it!” Luotian chuckled, reaching out again to grab Diao Dezhu.

*Buzz…*

However, Diao Dezhu was no pushover; he raised a spiritual light, his purple claws striking toward Luotian.

“Really think you can control anyone!” Luotian sneered, throwing a punch that collided with Diao Dezhu’s claws.

“Luotian, hurry! You can withstand it, but I can’t!” Sun Kelnian shouted, being chased by two Holy Princes and barely managing to escape.

At the same time, two more Xian Wang Mid-Stage masters rushed toward Luotian. Unknown to whom, they had been迷失 by a soul.

“Damn it, you’ve given them face!” Luotian glared at Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo, who were fleeing in panic. He cursed, his aura surging as he unleashed the power of a Soul-Subduing Master.

*Boom…*

Diao Dezhu was instantly blasted by Luotian’s fist, crashing into the coffin wall. Luotian moved like lightning, the coffin seemingly large but cramped for them. In an instant, he appeared before Diao Dezhu.

“Get out!” Luotian roared, an invisible suction force emanating from his hands and striking Diao Dezhu.

“Ah…” Diao Dezhu screamed, his face twisted as gray mist surged from his body—Luotian had forcibly pulled him out.

Chapter 2675: Catching a Soul in the Jar ()

Diao Dezhu’s face twisted, but his expression gradually improved. A gray shadow flew from his body and landed before Luotian.

“Die!” Luotian coldly spoke, his aura radiating an invisible power that imprinted itself on the gray soul.

However, as Luotian just initiated his attack, two Xian Wang Mid-Stage masters flying toward him also arrived. Their auras radiated formidable power, each throwing a punch and palm strike at Luotian.

“Get out!” Luotian sneered, shaking his body and directly countering the two Xian Wang Mid-Stage attacks.

*Boom, boom…*

A dull sound echoed from Luotian’s back; his face changed drastically. He felt a massive force strike him, his blood and qi surging.

“He’s the strongest!” One Xian Wang Mid-Stage master, his face covered in gray mist, gazed at Luotian.

“Don’t underestimate!” Luotian wiped his mouth’s blood, gazing at the two Xian Wang Mid-Stage masters with a serious expression. His brief confrontation had shown them to be formidable, even if they were Xian Wang Mid-Stage.

“I’ll help you!” Huangquan saw Luotian initiate combat and soared into the air, rushing toward him in a soul form to merge with Luotian.

Luotian didn’t resist; he truly needed to subdue everyone within the coffin, or Diao Dezhu would be in danger.

*Boom…*

As the soul merged into Luotian’s body, he instantly gained much knowledge. His already formidable soul power was further enhanced.

A powerful sensation arose within Luotian’s heart; he felt capable of grasping the sun, moon, and stars—confidence.

“I didn’t control you; our time is limited to one minute!” Huangquan’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind.

“Ah, did he bet everything on that kid?” As Huangquan merged with Luotian, the masters who had been attacking Diao Dezhu and Sun Kelnian’s group focused their gazes on Luotian, a powerful pressure enveloping him.

“Then let’s deal with him first!” Instantly, they made their decision and soared into the air. Nine people in total, each radiating an overwhelming aura.

“Huff…” As Luotian drew the nine people away, Diao Dezhu and others sighed in relief. However, they immediately wore worried expressions.

“Can he withstand it?” Sun Kelnian spoke softly, gazing at Luotian now locked in battle with the other nine souls.

“I’ll go help!” Diao Dezhu spoke, about to take a step but was stopped by Zhang Chenglong.

“No use; you’re not his match. The most we can do for him is to seize that lamp and sword!” Zhang Chenglong spoke.

“That’s definitely a treasure; through these two items, we can harm them!” Zhang Chenglong was quite experienced.

“Right!” Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo’s eyes brightened slightly, splitting into separate actions—one rushing toward the Huangquan Lamp, another toward the Huangquan Sword.

“You find the Huangquan Ruler; I’ll help that kid!” Zhang Chenglong addressed Diao Dezhu, then soared into the air toward Luotian’s battlefield.

“Kid, I’ll hold off two of them; the rest are up to you!” Zhang Chenglong addressed Luotian, raising his hand and striking two Xian Wang Mid-Stage masters.

At this moment, Luotian was battling nine people and retreating step by step. They were nine masters; if they were ordinary Xian Wang Mid-Stage, Luotian might have swept them aside. However, these people could each fight beyond their rank!

But Luotian, having merged with Huangquan’s residual soul, was no weaker. He faced them calmly and wielded the Rupture Heaven Spear, continuously battling the remaining seven.

Inside the Huangquan Coffin, battles raged on. Outside, it fell into calmness. Seeing Luotian and others enter the Huangquan Coffin, Xiang Tianming and others didn’t interfere. After all, two Xian Wang Peak-level Huangquan soldiers were too strong; even if they combined their eight strengths, it was only a delay. If prolonged, someone would die.

Xiang Tianming and his eight companions were bloodied and exhausted, returning to the Huangquan Pool’s edge. They gazed at the roaring Huangquan Coffin.

“Whether it’s good or bad?” Xiang Tianming sighed, standing beside Chen Zhanbiao and Ren Hongzhe.

At this moment, the eight Xian Wang Late-stage masters were all weak and watched the Huangquan Coffin, praying their sect’s strength would gain the opportunity inside.

“It’s bad!” Xiang Tianming’s words had just fallen when a playful voice echoed in their ears. A group of figures appeared, like a black cloud, walking toward the Huangquan Pool.

The leader was a youth with a dark warhammer on his back, eyes bright—one eye’s pupil overlapped two silver moons. It was none other than Yang Huanyu. Behind him stood eight figures in black robes. Upon their arrival, the atmosphere of the world changed; cold air swept across all directions, making Xiang Tianming and others shiver. Though the nine walked slowly, their aura locked onto Xiang Tianming’s group.

Any movement from them would invite a storm of attacks.

“Yang Huanyu!” Xiang Tianming’s eyes widened, gazing at Yang Huanyu. He had heard of it—after he and the Demon King, Zhang Daotian, and Yin Tianxiong sacrificed themselves, Yang Huanyu also sacrificed himself to give the Tianyuan Continent a chance to breathe and let Luotian leave.

“Old friends are many, but I don’t have time to chat!” Yang Huanyu smiled slightly, exchanging glances with Xiang Tianming. He led his eight companions past Xiang Tianming and entered the Huangquan Pool.

The Huangquan water roared again, countless Huangquan soldiers rising. This included two Xian Wang Peak-level Huangquan soldiers.

Yang Huanyu and his nine companions showed no fear, as if they hadn’t seen the roaring Huangquan soldiers.

“Freeze Heaven and Earth!” Yang Huanyu’s cold voice echoed, nine people standing still. Their hands formed seals, and a surge of ghostly mist erupted from their palms, sweeping across the world.

The ghostly mist spread rapidly, covering the entire Huangquan Pool and even the two Xian Wang Peak-level Huangquan soldiers.

In an instant, the vast yellow water and countless Huangquan soldiers were frozen in place. The two Xian Wang Peak-level Huangquan soldiers roared, but their speed slowed increasingly until they were also frozen.

“How is this possible!” Xiang Tianming and others gaped, watching the black ghostly mist that had frozen the entire Huangquan Pool. These were people who had nearly killed them earlier—now Yang Huanyu and his nine companions had subdued them so effortlessly.

Yang Huanyu and his nine people stepped forward, approaching the massive Huangquan Coffin. Their eyes showed a hint of amusement.

“It seems they’re all inside; we’ve arrived just in time!” Yang Huanyu lightly patted the Huangquan Coffin, and his eight companions dispersed to join him at nine positions.

Chapter 2676: Catching Them All ()

Nine people gazed at the yellow coffin, their eyes filled with admiration. Simultaneously, they formed black spiritual dragon-like symbols and rushed toward the Huangquan Coffin.

“What are they doing?” Seeing Yang Huanyu’s actions, Xiang Tianming and others felt confusion and a bad premonition.

“Huangquan, the mighty of old—now he’s met this fate. Fortunately, we survived; he’ll be forever buried in this coffin!” A black-robed master spoke, his voice carrying a sense of沧桑.

“Thus, living is so important!” Another master spoke, all expressing deep feelings and excitement.

*Crash…*

As they spoke, nine dragons wrapped around the entire Huangquan Coffin. Yang Huanyu and his nine people each pulled one dragon.

“Go!” The next moment, the nine shouted, pulling the massive coffin toward the Huangquan Pool.

“Naive! Trying to pull out the coffin!” The masters from various sects sneered, mocking Yang Huanyu’s group.

*Boom…*

However, before the old man’s words finished, a thunderous sound echoed. A large amount of yellow ice shattered and scattered onto the frozen Huangquan Pool.

Their eyes saw the massive Huangquan Coffin moving slowly, heading toward the pool’s edge under Yang Huanyu’s group.

“How is this possible!” Everyone gasped, their hearts tightening. Their eyes held disbelief.

“This was the resting place of an emperor! His methods, they’ve managed to break through!” The masters from various sects shouted.

“What is this Roaming Gate’s background? Their methods are so astonishing!” People marveled at the Huangquan Coffin moving toward the pool.

“What to do? They clearly intend to take this coffin; most importantly, Luotian and others are still inside!” Xiang Tianming spoke, gazing at Yang Huanyu’s group.

“Catch them all!” Other sect masters heard Xiang Tianming and their faces turned pale.

The Roaming Gate had already targeted them before, but it hadn’t succeeded. They hadn’t expected the Roaming Gate to persist and return.

“Did they all plan this?” Xiang Tianming’s face darkened, gazing at the yellow coffin now less than five thousand zhang away. Their current state was very poor; Yang Huanyu had clearly planned this, using the Huangquan soldiers to weaken them. He waited until Luotian and others entered the coffin before appearing. Otherwise, with Yang Huanyu’s ability to freeze the Huangquan Pool, he could have pulled out the coffin earlier.

From start to finish, it was a trap—a carefully designed one for ten sects. It had clearly succeeded; even if Luotian and others gained something, they would still be taken by the Roaming Gate.

“We can’t let them take the Huangquan Coffin!” Xiang Tianming spoke, slowly standing up and gazing at Yang Huanyu in the center.

“Right! We can’t let them!” Other sect masters also shouted, this matter was too big. Several sects’ Holy Princes had been taken; from now on, the Ten Yama Sect’s reputation in Hell would drop significantly.

As they spoke, Yang Huanyu and his group were now less than three thousand zhang away. They were about to pull the Huangquan Coffin out of the pool.

“Wanting death?” Yang Huanyu’s eyes turned cold, gazing at Xiang Tianming and others. One of his companions stopped pulling and stepped forward. The black mist gradually faded, revealing a smile—his face was none other than Jiang Chen, the former Lord of Buxian City. Now he couldn’t be called Jiang Chen but Jin Wuye, an ancient power from long ago. However, Jin Wuye’s current aura was not as it once was; it was unusually steady, radiating a strong master’s aura—clearly he had fully adapted to Jiang Chen’s body.

“Play, play; have fun with these little guys!” Jin Wuye smiled lightly, his hands moving rapidly. The world turned dark.

Storms reversed, a black cloud appeared above Jin Wuye’s head, and pressure built upon it. In an instant, the black cloud descended, making Xiang Tianming’s group grimace.

“Take care of them two; best to get them out first!” Xiang Tianming instructed Chen Zhanbiao and Ren Hongzhe, worried about Xu Liyi’s safety. After all, at their level of combat, a single aura could obliterate Xu Liyi.

“Got it!” Chen Zhanbiao shouted, lifting Xu Liyi and running toward the distance.

“Kill…” Xiang Tianming rushed with other sect masters toward the descending black cloud.

Eight Xian Wang Late-stage attacks were launched, colliding with the black cloud. A resounding explosion echoed, a violent wave sweeping across all directions and surrounding the Huangquan Pool.

“They have some strength; people so injured can still resist my attack—rare!” Jin Wuye sighed, showing no concern. His hands formed another black cloud and pressed down while his body moved toward Xiang Tianming’s group.

The battle at the Huangquan Pool continued, but Yang Huanyu and his group seemed to ignore it, pulling the Huangquan Coffin toward the pool’s edge.

Three thousand zhang… two thousand zhang…

In a single incense time, the massive Huangquan Coffin was pulled out by Yang Huanyu and his eight companions. The already wounded Xiang Tianming group could do nothing but continue fighting Jin Wuye.

“How strong!” The more they fought, the more Xiang Tianming and others were shocked; they felt their strength was far behind Jin Wuye’s.

*Boom…*

The Huangquan Coffin was pulled out of the pool, and as it exited, its aura significantly diminished.

“Bury the Soul!” Yang Huanyu’s hands moved rapidly, and a coffin instantly appeared to enclose the massive Huangquan Coffin.

“Go!” Yang Huanyu addressed his group, and the Bury the Soul coffin emitted waves of energy. It was carried by a strong master.

“Should we deal with them?” Other companions saw Xiang Tianming and others still fighting Jin Wuye.

Though Jin Wuye was strong, he could barely withstand eight injured Xian Wang Late-stage masters. He could only hold them off.

“Capture them; that phoenix is left, since we were once hometowners!” Yang Huanyu spoke lightly, leading the coffin-carrying strong master toward the exit.

“Yes, but these guys are really not good!” Several masters spoke, their bodies moving like ghosts toward Xiang Tianming’s group.

Meanwhile, inside the Huangquan Coffin, Luotian was unaware of these events and still battling those Holy Princes and masters from various sects.

“Damn it, if we could kill you, it would be over!” Luotian cursed, panting heavily. He punched Yin Wu, knocking him out and sending waves of gray mist from Yin Wu’s body.

Chapter 2677: Breaking the Coffin ()

Inside the Huangquan Coffin, Luotian sat on the ground. Nearby were several figures with their eyes closed, lying there.

On the other side, a gray figure continuously devoured the swirling gray mist within the coffin—none other than the Ghost King Huangquan, one of his residual souls. Luotian recognized this one.

After a fierce battle, Luotian finally defeated seven masters. Zhang Chenglong had also finished off two Xian Wang Mid-Stage masters.

Compared to Luotian, Zhang Chenglong was better off; he still had energy and was patting the Holy Princes and masters.

“Tsk, tsk, these guys are treasure vaults!” Each time Zhang Chenglong acted, a treasure appeared in his hands.

“Luotian, you’re fast!” As Luotian caught his breath, a figure descended from the sky. It was Sun Kelnian, holding an oil lamp in his hand.

“Got it?” Luotian’s eyes brightened slightly, knowing Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo had gone to subdue the Huangquan Lamp and Huangquan Sword.

“Of course, who else would it be?” Sun Kelnian’s face bore a triumphant grin as he gazed at the oil lamp in his hand, filled with accomplishment.

Sun Kelnian had just landed when Sima Tuo also arrived with a grin, walking away from the Huangquan flesh. His expression was triumphant.

“Did you get the Huangquan Sword too?” Sun Kelnian was slightly surprised, realizing Sima Tuo had succeeded.

Zhang Chenglong remained there, continuously patting the Holy Princes and masters, almost stripping them to their bare bones.

Time passed slowly; the Huangquan residual soul finally devoured the other scattered souls and rushed toward the Huangquan flesh.

It encountered no resistance, merging into Huangquan’s flesh.

As it merged, an imperial aura erupted from Huangquan, causing Luotian and Zhang Chenglong to tremble.

*Buzz…*

The Huangquan Lamp in Sun Kelnian’s hand suddenly trembled. The flame on its wick jumped repeatedly, emitting a dazzling divine light. Finally, it broke free from Sun Kelnian’s hand and returned to Huangquan’s head, the divine light enveloping him.

“This…!” Sun Kelnian’s eyes were filled with disbelief; he had just felt he had subdued the Huangquan Lamp, sacrificing many treasures.

“I’m f***ing broke…” Sun Kelnian cursed loudly, feeling no connection to the Huangquan Lamp. His voice carried a whine.

“Haha, this sword is more reliable…” Sima Tuo watched Sun Kelnian’s despair and smiled with glee, pulling out the Huangquan Sword.

*Buzz…*

However, as soon as the Huangquan Sword appeared in Sima Tuo’s hand, it also emitted a clamor. Its sword energy surged, breaking free from Sima Tuo’s hand and turning its blade to face Huangquan’s flesh.

……

“Don’t play like this! Are they rebelling?” Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo shouted, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

But Huangquan didn’t hear them; both treasures were drawn to him by his aura, returning to Huangquan.

“Sigh…” Diao Dezhu sighed, having searched for the Huangquan Ruler but found nothing. However, seeing Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo’s despair, he too felt glee.

Zhang Chenglong also felt glee; the crisis had passed, and he relaxed his mindset.

Time passed, another incense time elapsed; Huangquan’s fleshly body gradually stabilized its aura.

“被困住了, someone has taken the Huangquan Coffin out of the Huangquan Pool!” Huangquan’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind, making him startle.

“Success?” Luotian’s eyes glowed with joy; if Huangquan could revive, any problem would be solved.

“Sort of. However, this flesh seems nothing special but lifeless; I still need your help!”

“Help me refine a Nine-Grade Elixir, the Dao of Mutual Existence!” Huangquan responded. Through their spiritual communication, they exchanged rapidly; the formula for the Dao of Mutual Existence Elixir appeared in Luotian’s mind.

“My time is short; when I fully revive, I’ll find you. The Huangquan Pool is a treasure; now I’ll send you out. After exiting, go to the bottom of the Huangquan Coffin; there lies the Huangquan Ruler. It will help you!”

“Also, don’t provoke those outside!” Huangquan’s voice disappeared from Luotian’s mind, making him frown.

As soon as the words were spoken, Huangquan emitted waves of fluctuation, beginning to strike against the coffin’s sides.

The Huangquan Lamp’s flame suddenly surged; the Huangquan Sword emitted a clamor, and within it, sounds of water echoed. It began to strike with overwhelming sword energy.

“Hmm?” As Huangquan struck, Yang Huanyu, who was carrying the massive coffin, had a slight change in expression. He felt his carried coffin growing heavier.

*Crack… Crack… Crack…*

The nine black spiritual dragons previously bound to the Huangquan Coffin broke one by one, causing Yang Huanyu’s expression to slightly change.

“Is it this fast? These useless guys!” Yang Huanyu spoke softly, his eyes showing impatience. He extended a finger, and blood dripped from it, landing on the Bury the Soul coffin.

“Let’s see how much he recovers; if it exceeds two-tenths, we’ll give up!” Yang Huanyu whispered.

“Two-tenths of an emperor’s strength, we nine should be able to handle it!” The strong master carrying the Bury the Soul coffin spoke softly.

“Don’t forget, who he is—he’s Huangquan!” Yang Huanyu replied and watched the approaching Jin Wuye.

Each person held someone, their bodies bloodied. Xiang Tianming stood at a distance, his face dark and motionless.

“They’ve all been captured; only that phoenix hasn’t moved, remaining there!” Jin Wuye spoke, throwing the masters toward Yang Huanyu.

The masters’ faces were extremely grim; they were the Grand Masters of Ten Yama Sects, powerful beings in Hell. With so few Xian Wang Late-stage masters, they were now treated like livestock and thrown here.

“Keep them; they can fetch a good price. I believe the Ten Yama Sects will pay with valuable items to exchange for these masters!” Yang Huanyu smiled.

*Boom…*

As soon as Yang Huanyu’s words finished, the Bury the Soul coffin suddenly exploded. The strong master carrying it fell to his knees, his body sinking as Huangquan’s coffin appeared on his back.

“What’s going on? Did Huangquan revive?” The expressions of Jin Wuye and others finally changed. Yang Huanyu’s hands flashed with black energy, striking the Huangquan coffin with a thunderous roar. The massive coffin flew from the strong master’s back and landed on the ground, its lid opening to reveal Luotian and others.

Chapter 2678: Retreat into the Huangquan Pool ()

*Boom, boom, boom…*

A dull sound echoed; several figures appeared outside the Huangquan Coffin. Most were lying on the ground, some even having their clothes stripped off.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was stunned; even the Roaming Gate people were bewildered, unsure why these people’s clothes had vanished.

“Did something indecent happen inside the coffin?” Jin Wuye spoke, gazing at Luotian and Diao Dezhu with a strange look.

The captured masters of the Ten Yama Sect also gazed at Luotian and five others with strange expressions, as only they appeared intact.

*Buzz…*

As everyone was astonished, the Huangquan Coffin emitted a buzzing sound and flew toward the Huangquan Pool.

The Roaming Gate people’s eyes slightly changed; even Yang Huanyu showed a complex expression before returning to calmness, pulling back those wanting to rush into the Huangquan Pool.

*Buzz…*

Divine light poured over the entire Huangquan Pool, covering it. The ghostly mist that had frozen the pool was dispelled; the frozen water returned to Huangquan, surrounding the coffin.

“Indeed!” Yang Huanyu muttered softly, gazing at the Huangquan Pool before turning his gaze to Luotian.

“I told you, next time we meet, I’ll take your life!” Yang Huanyu spoke softly, stepping forward and placing his foot on the ground. His dark warhammer fell into his hand, instantly appearing before Luotian. He raised his hand to suppress Luotian.

“Kill…” Jin Wuye and others also launched attacks, rushing toward Zhang Chenglong and Diao Dezhu.

“Run! Head for the Huangquan Pool!” Luotian shouted at them, sensing a strong danger from Jin Wuye’s group. They were no match for these people.

“Damn it!” Zhang Chenglong’s eyes showed frustration, throwing a spiritual talisman. The ancient talisman seemed ready to shatter at any moment. However, as it was thrown, a world-destroying aura erupted instantly.

The thunderous sound echoed across eight directions; countless lightning serpents rushed toward Yang Huanyu’s group, forcing them to stop and defend.

*Boom, boom, boom…*

Though the countless lightning serpents only held them back for a moment, Yang Huanyu’s group broke through the lightning storm.

This brief moment was enough for Luotian and others; they flew toward Xiang Tianming, grabbed him, and entered the Huangquan Pool.
