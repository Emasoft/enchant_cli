“That Dragon Clan youth isn’t simple. Reincarnation of Long Zhan Tian—whether he’ll rise from destruction and vie for dominance remains to be seen!” The gray-robed Domain Master of the Chaos Realm, Zhuge Haotian, spoke softly.

“Regrettable, the reincarnated body never appears. It was suppressed by Heaven’s Will. Otherwise, who could rival it?” Zhuge Haotian’s tone shifted, his eyes reflecting sorrow.

“This is the perilous nature of extraordinary constitutions. Though formidable, they endure endless trials. Only by overcoming all obstacles can one ascend to dominance!” The elder figures nodded in agreement, yet none believed a mid-Saint could defy Heaven’s Will.

These formidable powers debated, while others remained unaware but watched the mountain where Luo Tian and his companions stood with eager anticipation.

“Is this a preliminary clash?” Dozens of elders at the peak of Sainthood gathered, exchanging words with admiration. They knew within a century, these youths would surpass them.

“Who do you think will prevail? This is the first clash among prodigies! I sense that shadowy figure emerging later isn’t simple either!” Excitement flickered in the people’s eyes as they awaited the outcome.

Thunderous roars echoed, lasting a moment before five disheveled figures emerged into view.

“Evenly matched. However, Luo Tian has taken Yan Hongtao’s place, facing two opponents!” The five men, their mouths bleeding, bore expressions of shock.

Luo Tian’s group all bled from their lips, locking gazes before turning their eyes to the gray figure with fury.

“Chaos Domain! Zhuge Huangchao!” Besides Luo Tian, Yan Hongtao, Sun Feiwen, and Zhou Wei shouted in unison, their voices resounding with boundless wrath.

“Chaos Domain’s people have finally arrived. When the Ancient Heaven Palace appeared, they didn’t show up. Yet now, the Demon Clan’s ritual has drawn them. This Demon Clan ritual is indeed more lively than ever!” The crowd murmured, observing the gray-veined Zhuge Huangchao whose aura had calmed.

“Zhuge Huangchao, what do you mean?” Yan Hongtao rebuked sharply, his aura surging as he stared coldly at Zhuge Huangchao’s youth.

“Nothing in particular. I simply felt the urge to test my skills!” The gray-veined youth smiled, wiping his lips as he addressed them.

“Very well. I too felt the urge to test Chaos Domain’s prodigy!” Sun Feiwen radiated golden light, his gaze fixed on Zhuge Huangchao.

“you are not my match!” Yet Zhuge Huangchao ignored Sun Feiwen, his eyes set on Luo Tian.

“You are the reincarnated body? Luo Tian?” Zhuge Huangchao inquired, clenching his fists as his battle spirit rekindled.

“You dare belittle me?” Sun Feiwen, like a lit firecracker, felt his honor wounded by the disdain.

“I am!” Luo Tian patted Sun Feiwen’s shoulder, locking eyes with Zhuge Huangchao.

“The reincarnated body Luo Tian. Your recent momentum is impressive. Will you test me?” Zhuge Huangchao addressed Luo Tian immediately, his focus set on him.

Chapter 1080: The Ritual Begins

“Reincarnated Body Luo Tian, your momentum is impressive. Will you test me?” Facing Zhuge Huangchao’s challenge, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly.

“Zhuge Huangchao, you’re too arrogant. Do you not regard us at all?” Zhou Wei smiled, yet his expression carried anger.

“Indeed. You think you’re your brother Zhuge Jie? What are you? With your elder’s backing, you’ve become overbearing!” Sun Feiwen mocked as well, clearly discontent with Zhuge Huangchao.

“Kid, come on!” Yan Hongtao acted directly, swinging his hand toward Zhuge Huangchao.

“Yan Hongtao, your strength is indeed formidable—especially in assassination. If I were ambushed, I’d have an 80% chance of dying. But in direct combat, you’re no match for me. We’d be evenly matched!” Zhuge Huangchao spoke calmly, his confidence evident.

At the same time, Zhuge Huangchao struck with a palm, clashing again against Yan Hongtao’s crimson hand.

“Among you all, the one I’m most uncertain of is you—Reincarnated Body Luo Tian. Only after a fight can I know if you’re my equal!” Zhuge Huangchao’s voice rang out, his eyes ablaze with battle spirit.

Hearing this, the crowd’s gazes narrowed. Even Yan Hongtao, Sun Feiwen, and Zhou Wei fell silent. As Zhuge Huangchao said, Luo Tian was indeed formidable.

Yan Hongtao had nearly taken Luo Tian’s life when he was at mid-Saint level. Yet now, Luo Tian had become inscrutable to Yan Hongtao.

“You insolent bastard! If you dare to insult Luo Tian, send your brother instead. Why send your underling to mock him?” Zheng Xin and others roared, their gazes fixed on Zhuge Huangchao.

Long Jie stepped forward, standing before Luo Tian with a cold gaze. “I’ll fight in place of my brother. You’re not worthy of his hand!”

The crowd’s eyes widened in realization. Zhuge Huangchao was clearing the path for his brother to vie for the Epoch Master.

“Damn fool!” Yan Hongtao and the others’ gazes darkened further. Zhuge Huangchao’s blatant contempt left them feeling humiliated, as if they weren’t even worthy of challenging his brother Zhuge Jie.

“Hmph?” Upon seeing Long Jie, Zhuge Huangchao’s expression shifted slightly before his eyes gleamed with admiration.

“Dragon Clan blood is so dense—it’s rare indeed. Let me take you as my steed!” Zhuge Huangchao addressed Long Jie, his gaze filled with greed.

“Die!” Hearing this, Luo Tian’s expression darkened. A cold killing intent spread across the mountain, his gaze toward Zhuge Huangchao turning hostile.

Since Zhuge Huangchao had arrived to provoke them, Luo Tian had remained silent. He knew this was the Demon Clan’s domain; he must leave them some leeway, even Yan Hongtao hadn’t gone as far.

But Zhuge Huangchao’s words had crossed the line. He dared to claim Long Jie as his steed. For Luo Tian, those closest to him were sacred—any harm to Long Jie or Zheng Xin would be a death sentence.

“I accept! But my subordinates have never returned alive. Prepare yourself!” Luo Tian’s eyes were cold, his voice echoing across the mountain.

As Luo Tian’s words fell, the entire mountain and even the Demon Mountain erupted in murmurs. All faces bore excitement as they watched Luo Tian’s group.

“Good, bold!” Zhuge Huangchao laughed, his aura surging again. Gray Chaos Saint Power coiled around him, and a gray longsword rested in his hand.

“Brother, I’ll take this on. This man isn’t worthy of your hand. Since he’s here to clear the path for his brother, I’ll fight in your stead!” Long Jie spoke loudly, his voice echoing like a youth. Dragon aura and imperial dragon qi coiled outward.

“Everyone, what’s happening?” Just as the battle threatened to ignite, a laugh echoed. A black-robed Nan Gong Yuqing stepped forward from the crowd, his eyes smiling but scanning Zhuge Huangchao.

“Nan Gong, you’re the host. This kid clearly came to disrupt the event. Yet you still smile—your demeanor has changed!” Zheng Xin and others saw Nan Gong Yuqing arrive, knowing the fight would not proceed. They teased him.

“Enough, everyone. Let’s not fight here. The Domain Masters have ordered that after the Demon Clan’s ritual, each domain may send a young strength to compete, showcasing their power. Then everyone can fight freely. For now, let’s maintain harmony!” Nan Gong Yuqing spoke with authority, standing before Luo Tian’s group.

“Hmph. Since the Domain Masters have spoken, we naturally can’t disobey! Then let’s meet on the stage!” Zhuge Huangchao smiled, scanning Luo Tian’s group.

“Arrogant? I had some goodwill toward Chaos Domain before. Now, none remains. Arrogant brat—don’t expect me to cry when you’re beaten!” Zheng Xin and others mocked.

Zhuge Huangchao ignored their words, raising his hand. Vast Chaos Saint Power filled the mountain, and structures rose from the earth.

“Apologies for damaging your domain’s property. I hope you don’t mind!” Zhuge Huangchao spoke, restoring the destroyed buildings.

The crowd watched with anticipation as Luo Tian’s seven men gathered. With Nan Gong Yuqing’s arrival, the strongest seven youths from the Demon Clan’s ritual finally converged.

“Regrettable, the Divine Clan’s Primordial Body hasn’t arrived. If it had, the spectacle would have been even greater!”

“Also, Zhuge Jie of Chaos Domain—heard he’s a Primordial Saint. If Zhuge Huangchao is this strong with Epoch Master potential, how formidable must Zhuge Jie be?” The crowd murmured, excitement in their eyes. Compared to the Demon Clan’s challenge stage, they now anticipated Luo Tian and the prodigies’ clash more.

“Let’s go. I’ve finished my duties. Let’s get drunk tonight!” Nan Gong Yuqing sighed, exhausted from these days. He felt his face might crack from smiling—his usual reserve made this awkward.

“Let’s go!” Zheng Xin and others pulled Luo Tian and Long Jie back to the pavilion. Sun Feiwen and Zhou Wei were also drawn into the group, even Yan Hongtao was pulled in, a sense of solidarity.

Yan Hongtao clearly felt the same. This Zhuge Huangchao was insufferable, and he truly wanted to kill him—provided it were an assassination.

Faced with the group’s rejection, Zhuge Huangchao ignored them, merely pouring wine for himself.

The crowd watched with pity. Wanting to approach and build rapport, but after Yan Hongtao’s example, no one dared. They gave up, and the mountain returned to its former state.

Time passed slowly. A day had finally ended, and the entire Demon Clan was now crowded.

“Dong… Dong…” A heavy bell echoed across the Demon Mountain, ringing three times. The Demon Clan’s disciples appeared one by one on the mountain’s midsection.

“Ten thousand… a hundred thousand… ten million…” The vast Demon Mountain, black-clad figures stood there. Their eyes bore solemnity as they gazed at the platform.

On the platform, heads of various domains’ sects and Saint Princes sat together. Higher up, six elders at the brink of Epoch Master sat there, their gazes fixed on the mountain’s depths.

“That middle-aged man is our Divine Clan’s old Divine King. His strength is undoubtedly the strongest in the nine domains!” Sun Feiwen spoke with pride, addressing Luo Tian.

“That one is Zhou Tianxing of the Star-Array Domain. His strength isn’t weak among them, but you know Star-Array—skilled in calculation and prediction!” Sun Feiwen introduced Luo Tian.

“The Divine Clan’s old Divine King is indeed formidable. But he isn’t necessarily the strongest in the nine domains! After all, even the mightiest can’t escape time’s erosion. Though he appears the youngest among them, everyone knows he is the oldest!”

“So to say the nine domains’ strongest is my Chaos Domain’s Master, Zhuge Haotian. Though he isn’t young, his power is at its peak!” Zhuge Huangchao smiled proudly, gazing at Zhuge Haotian with reverence.

“Disgusting. How dare he act as if he’s the best in the world! I really want to beat this kid!” Hearing Zhuge Huangchao’s words, Zheng Xin and others could no longer bear it. How could this kid be so arrogant?

“You really think the Demon Lord and Shiyu Domain’s Master are doing nothing? They’re hopeless!” Gu Lei and others shouted back.

Zhuge Huangchao said nothing, but this silence implied agreement. The crowd fell silent again. Zheng Xin and others had never before found themselves speechless by a person so arrogant—this was unprecedented.

“Everyone, welcome to our Demon Clan’s grand event—the ritual!” Three elders at the peak of Sainthood appeared in the sky, smiling as they addressed the millions of disciples and elders.

“Roar…” The millions of Demon Clan disciples roared, their gazes respectful toward the three elders and the Demon Lord’s avatar.

“I declare the ritual begins!” The three elders spoke loudly, their voices echoing in people’s ears.

Chapter 1081: The Struggle for the Clan Leader

On the Demon Mountain, millions of disciples roared lowly, their voices piercing the sky. All clad in black robes, they resembled a vast cloud of darkness standing there. Their auras radiated outward, converging into the sky, overwhelming魔气 (demonic energy) that shrouded the entire mountain, turning its upper sky into darkness with no light.

“Boom… Boom…” A deep sound echoed. The three Demon Clan elders moved their hands, infusing black runes into the demonic energy above. Soon, a black, ancient-looking altar emerged from the demonic energy.

“Children of the Demon Clan, offer your blood to honor our ancestors!” The three elders at the peak of Sainthood spoke loudly, their voices like a demonic chant in the dark sky.

“Yes!” The Demon Clan disciples responded in unison, extending their fingers. With devotion, they danced them before their bodies, sending droplets of blood into the sky toward the black ancient altar.

“Thousand drops… Ten thousand drops…” Millions of blood droplets formed into serpentine dragons, flowing across the Demon Clan. Except for the Demon Lord, all offered a single drop of blood to the black altar.

Millions of people’s blood, radiating overwhelming power, formed a river of crimson that spread across the altar.

Black light flared on the altar. The blood river instantly filled its deep rune slots, flowing into the altar like a star.

“May our ancestors bless us forever!” The three elders at the peak of Sainthood bowed, their hands flashing with black light into the altar.

“Buzz…” Under the three elders’ guidance, the massive altar slowly descended into the demonic energy, vanishing from sight.

“The ritual is complete!” The three elders at the peak of Sainthood spoke, waving their hands. The demonic energy above dissipated, and sunlight returned, bringing people back to reality.

“What is that altar? What purpose does it serve?” Luo Tian and others looked with confusion as the black altar vanished from view.

“That’s the Demon Clan’s method—using their people’s blood to nourish their self-proclaimed heritage!” Sun Feiwen spoke, his eyes filled with admiration.

The Demon Clan’s heritage! These five simple words contained immense meaning. Luo Tian and others knew the greatest difference between sacred sects and ordinary sects was heritage—Epoch Treasures were merely surface-level heritage.

The self-proclaimed old masters, however, were the Demon Clan’s true heritage. The weakest among them was a power at the beginning of an epoch. They sealed themselves to delay their life’s end, but if the Demon Clan faced a dire crisis, these heritages would be unsealed. This was the foundation of any sacred sect.

Though these old masters only fought once, they would face their end. Yet their terrifying power could sweep aside any sect without heritage, leaving no chance to resist. The four Saint Star Domains and the Fire Domain were inferior here—so long as these heritages existed, no one dared to challenge the sacred sects.

“Enough. The ritual has ended. Now comes the stage for clan leader challenges. You all know, our Demon Clan recently underwent some changes. The new clan leader Nan Gong Bo has just returned. Thus, this challenge is against Nan Gong Bo!” An elder at the peak of Sainthood spoke, gazing at Nan Gong Bo standing at the front of the Demon Clan’s crowd.

At the same time, the three elders at the peak of Sainthood conjured a stage before people’s eyes. They personally used black transparent barriers to enclose the stage.

“Respect elders!” Nan Gong Yuqing stood beside Nan Gong Bo, his face showing concern. He knew the greatest test for Nan Gong Bo had arrived. If he overcame this challenge, his clan leader position would be solid.

“Rest easy!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore confidence. His footsteps echoed, forming a black line as he appeared on the stage. He gazed at several elders who had been close to Nan Gong Liang and neutral elders.

“He is the new clan leader of the Demon Clan? His aura seems good, but can he survive a wheeling battle?” Sects of the Divine and Demon Domain murmured, their eyes filled with anticipation. The clan leader position was crucial for the Demon Clan’s future.

“Don’t underestimate this Nan Gong Bo. It is said he was found by the previous clan leader, Nan Gong De. His talent was exceptional, and they became sworn brothers. Yet it seemed like father-son. Due to some unknown reason, he left the Demon Clan. Now it seems related to Nan Gong Liang. But no one expected him to return after so long, bringing back the Demon Clan’s lost Demon Lord’s decree!” Someone with knowledge spoke, explaining to everyone.

“Enough. Whoever不服 (disagrees), come forward. The rules are known—clan leaders cannot die, but a failed challenge means death. Think carefully!” The three elders at the peak of Sainthood spoke, their voices carrying a touch of cruelty. This was the Demon Clan’s usual manner.

“Begin! If no one challenges within a incense stick, Nan Gong Bo will be the clan leader!” The three elders announced before vanishing from the stage, appearing behind the Demon Lord and others with respect.

“Nan Gong Bo, I不服 (disagree)!” Just as the three elders’ words had barely finished, and even before the Demon Clan’s disciples lit their incense, a clear voice echoed across the mountain. A figure surged into view, standing opposite Nan Gong Bo.

“Nan Gong Sheng, the most loyal supporter of Nan Gong Liang. His strength is undeniable—Saint-level late phase, and he has mastered the Demon Clan’s secret art, the Demon Emperor’s Power. His strength is no less than Nan Gong Liang!” The millions of Demon Clan disciples bore expressions of shock. They hadn’t expected the first challenger, Nan Gong Sheng, to appear so soon.

“Respect elders. Can he do it?” Zheng Xin and others looked at Luo Tian, their faces filled with concern.

“Rest easy. Respect elder’s strength is far greater than you imagine!” Luo Tian’s eyes held confidence, gazing at the calm Respect Elder on the stage.

“Creating a genius who enters the Demon Realm—how could he be inferior? If born in our era, Respect Elder might have been even more terrifying!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

“Kill!” As Nan Gong Sheng stood on the stage, he immediately attacked without greeting. He rushed toward Nan Gong Bo in an instant.

“Demon Emperor’s Power!” Nan Gong Sheng roared, infusing black demonic energy into his arms. His arms swelled by three inches, and his massive hand seemed to crush everything. He clenched his fingers into claws, reaching for Nan Gong Bo.

Nan Gong Bo saw Nan Gong Sheng before him. His eyes showed no panic, but when Nan Gong Sheng used the Demon Emperor’s Power, his aged eyes bore a look of solemnity.

“This Nan Gong Sheng is straightforward. He used his specialty right away!” People murmured, eager to see how Nan Gong Bo would respond.

Nan Gong Bo moved his hands slightly. Black dragons emerged from his body, flowing into his hands, making them appear as if dipped in black ink.

“Die! Illusion Demon Fist!” Nan Gong Bo roared, his fist’s aura shaking the heavens. He didn’t retreat but struck directly at Nan Gong Sheng.

The collision of fists and claws echoed. In the next moment, a black figure was blasted back, falling onto the stage.

“Boom…” The disheveled figure collapsed on the stage. Nan Gong Sheng’s eyes reflected disbelief. His entire arm was shattered, and he hadn’t expected Nan Gong Bo to be so powerful—just one move had left him severely wounded.

The millions of Demon Clan disciples bore expressions of intense shock. They hadn’t expected Nan Gong Bo to be so formidable. The entire mountain echoed with gasps of surprise.

“This Nan Gong Bo is more talented than the previous Nan Gong De!” A Saint-level elder of the Divine and Demon Domain spoke, his voice filled with admiration.

Nan Gong Bo ignored it all. He leapt into the air, appearing before Nan Gong Sheng in an instant. Black demonic fists struck repeatedly against Nan Gong Sheng’s body.

One punch, and Nan Gong Sheng was shattered. Two punches, and he regenerated blood before dying again. Three punches, and Nan Gong Sheng was annihilated by Nan Gong Bo’s fists.

“Three punches to kill a Saint-level late phase!” People watched Nan Gong Bo, seemingly frail but with an explosive attack. Their eyes were filled with awe.

“Who else dares to come?” Nan Gong Bo stood on the stage, gazing at the elders with provocation.

“Nan Gong Bo, don’t be arrogant. I’ll test your abilities!” A voice echoed as a figure stood on the stage, holding a black small tower. It was Third Elder Nan Gong Yuan, who had previously lent the Demon Emperor Tower to Nan Gong Liang.

“A pseudo-Epoch Treasure. Third Elder is trying to win with a pseudo-Epoch Treasure?” People’s faces showed confusion, gazing at Nan Gong Yuan holding the Demon Emperor Tower.

“You’re not even as strong as Nan Gong Sheng. You came to die!” Nan Gong Bo spoke lightly against the one holding a pseudo-Epoch Treasure.

“Since you dared to come, do you think I have no preparations?” Nan Gong Yuan’s face showed a cold smile. He threw the Demon Emperor Tower from his hand.

“Thousand-Machine Demon Umbrella!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore a cold smile. A black umbrella spun from his hand, colliding with the black Demon Emperor Tower.

“I never intended to win with just one pseudo-Epoch Treasure!” Nan Gong Yuan showed no surprise at Nan Gong Bo’s conjuring of the Thousand-Machine Demon Umbrella.

At the same time, Nan Gong Yuan’s hand revealed another black sculpture. He activated it, sending it toward himself.

“Good, prepared,” Luo Tian watched Nan Gong Yuan’s black sculpture. His eyes showed a slight smile, sighing inwardly.

Chapter 1082: Striking the Demon Clan’s Face

On the Demon Mountain, a towering stage hovered above people. Two elders faced each other. Above them, a black Demon Tower and a black giant umbrella collided with thunderous roars. Black demonic energy continuously fell from their collision.

“Not enough, a pseudo-Epoch Treasure!” Nan Gong Yuan smiled, producing a palm-sized black sculpture. He activated it, throwing it into the sky.

“Moo…” A roar echoed as the black sculpture swelled, transforming into a massive elephant. Black energy enveloped it, its immense body exuding pressure.

“Fourth-Element Hall’s pseudo-Epoch Treasure?” People showed surprise. They hadn’t expected the Fourth-Element Hall to lend a pseudo-Epoch Treasure to Nan Gong Yuan.

“Clearly, the Fourth-Element Hall doesn’t want Respect Elder to become clan leader!” Zheng Xin and others gazed toward the Fourth-Element Hall, their expressions deep.

“Not just the Fourth-Element Hall. Many sects don’t want Respect Elder to become clan leader. These sects have conflicts with me, and everyone knows Respect Elder’s relationship with us. Naturally, they’ll try to prevent him from becoming clan leader!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, speaking softly.

“Fourth-Element Hall?” Nan Gong Bo gazed toward the Fourth-Element Hall, his eyes flashing cold.

“Haha, didn’t expect it? You only have one Thousand-Machine Demon Umbrella. How can you fight me with two pseudo-Epoch Treasures?”

“Moreover, I have more than two!” Nan Gong Yuan smiled coldly. He flipped his hand again, and a purple mountain emerged from his hand, rushing toward Nan Gong Bo.

“Three pseudo-Epoch Treasures! That mountain is the如意宗 (Ruyi Sect)’s pseudo-Epoch Treasure!” People finally turned pale, their eyes gazing at the pseudo-Epoch Treasures radiating overwhelming power.

“Respect Elder is in danger! Three pseudo-Epoch Treasures, using a Saint-level late phase to control them—enough to harm even a Saint-level peak!” Zheng Xin and others showed concern, gazing at Nan Gong Bo.

Nan Gong Bo’s face remained calm. Even facing three pseudo-Epoch Treasures, his expression was still tranquil.

He flipped his hand. A string of purple bells emerged from his hand, activated by Nan Gong Bo. They rang with clear sounds, like the sound of the Dao, forming a torrent that swept toward the demon elephant.

“Pseudo-Epoch Treasure. Didn’t you say Respect Elder only had one?” Nan Gong Yuan’s face trembled, a bad premonition rising.

“You bastard! Finally found the real one. It’s the Demon Clan!” In the sea of people, two figures with hunched postures cursed loudly upon seeing the purple bells. Their voices were slightly hysterical. If Luo Tian and Sun Feiwen saw them, they would recognize the two as tomb robbers Sun Keinian and thief Sima Tuo.

They infiltrated the Demon Clan for two reasons: to covet the Demon Clan’s great tomb and to find those who had previously harmed them. This bell was the pseudo-Epoch Treasure Luo Tian had taken from them, given to Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Damn fool! The Demon Clan, wait for me. I’ll definitely leave your ancestors’ graves!” Sun Keinian and Sima Tuo gritted their teeth, vanishing into the crowd.

“More treasures? How will you resist my purple mountain?” Nan Gong Yuan sneered, activating the purple mountain to crush Nan Gong Bo. Due to a bad premonition, he wanted to end this quickly.

“Since you want to fight with pseudo-Epoch Treasures, I’ll join!” Nan Gong Bo smiled, flipping his hand. A golden bell rang out.

The golden bell flew from Nan Gong Bo’s hand, colliding with the purple mountain and blocking it.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed across the Demon Mountain. Three pseudo-Epoch Treasures collided, lightning flashing from the sky, striking before Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuan.

“You have more?” Nan Gong Bo smiled playfully, gazing at Nan Gong Yuan. His voice was icy.

Nan Gong Yuan’s face darkened completely. He now understood, through the golden bell, that Luo Tian had lent him two pseudo-Epoch Treasures. His greatest reliance on the stage was these three pseudo-Epoch Treasures. Without them, his strength was even weaker than Nan Gong Sheng. And considering he had killed Nan Gong Sheng in three punches, Nan Gong Yuan’s face turned pale.

“You don’t have them. I do!” Nan Gong Bo smiled, revealing the golden Shangtian Bow in his hand.

The demon arrow soared across the sky. The bowstring was full moon, and the black demon arrow aimed at Nan Gong Yuan. Nan Gong Yuan’s face turned pale immediately.

“I surrender! I admit you are the clan leader!” Nan Gong Yuan, at the moment the arrow aimed at him, felt his legs weaken. His eyes begged for mercy as he addressed Nan Gong Bo.

“Too late to surrender. Since you came, stay here!” Nan Gong Bo sneered. He never intended to let Nan Gong Yuan go.

“Blast…” The bowstring trembled slightly. A black dragon instantly shot from Nan Gong Bo’s hand, appearing beside Nan Gong Yuan.

Nan Gong Bo was at Saint-level late phase. His strength surpassed Luo Tian slightly. The power of pseudo-Epoch Treasures could be fully unleashed by him. How formidable was the demon arrow’s power?

Cold energy instantly invaded Nan Gong Yuan’s body. In the next moment, this Saint-level late phase powerhouse was annihilated by the arrow, his essence and body destroyed. He had no chance to regenerate.

“Fierce! One arrow killed a Saint-level late phase. Such a feat is rare in history!” People’s faces bore awe, watching Nan Gong Bo on the stage.

“With six pseudo-Epoch Treasures, even if you rely solely on treasures, you can crush your opponent! Who dares to come? Everyone dies!” People spoke in disbelief, discussing loudly.

The heads of the Fourth-Element Hall and Ruyi Sect turned pale. They saw Nan Gong Bo’s intent to never return the treasures.

“Please, clan leader Nan Gong Bo, return our sect’s treasure!” A senior of the Fourth-Element Hall flew up, addressing Nan Gong Bo.

When the Fourth-Element Hall’s senior flew up, the Ruyi Sect’s elder also rose, standing before the Fourth-Element Hall’s senior. Their meaning was clear—they hoped Nan Gong Bo would return their sect’s pseudo-Epoch Treasure.

These two senior elders spoke with resolve, for they had lent the treasures to Nan Gong Yuan. Now that Nan Gong Yuan was dead, these pseudo-Epoch Treasures naturally belonged to Nan Gong Bo.

“Damn shameless!” Zheng Xin and others cursed loudly, not caring about their status. With Diao Yuan Mountain supporting them, they knew these elders wouldn’t dare harm them.

Other sects of the Divine and Demon Domain bore mocking expressions, gazing at the two elders. They clearly thought these elders were shameless, but since the Fourth-Element Hall and Ruyi Sect were major sects in the Divine and Demon Domain, they couldn’t afford to offend them.

The two senior elders’ faces turned red. They gazed at Nan Gong Bo: “Clan leader, these two pseudo-Epoch Treasures were originally our sect’s. If you return them to us, from now on, my two sects’ strength will follow your lead. If…”

The two senior elders didn’t finish their words, but the implication was clear—there was a threat.

“Not returning!” Nan Gong Bo’s answer was simple. He gave them no face, for the grudge had already been formed. Even if these two sects didn’t oppose him, he would find trouble with them.

Being publicly humiliated by Nan Gong Bo in front of so many people, the two senior elders clearly felt embarrassed. Their faces darkened: “Hmph. Hope clan leader Nan Gong Bo keeps this position stable!”

“Idiots!” The two senior elders’ words had barely finished when people’s contempt grew even more.

“Are these two old fools so senile? Or have they been acting tyrannically for years?” Zheng Xin and others mocked, their voices filled with deep contempt.

The two senior elders felt no shame for their words. They flew toward their respective groups.

“You’re threatening our Demon Clan?” Just as the two senior elders turned, three cold voices echoed in their ears. Their bodies trembled, feeling like a thunderclap had exploded in their ears.

In an instant, three Demon Clan elders appeared before them. Their gazes were icy as they stared at the two Ruyi Sect and Fourth-Element Hall elders.

“This!” Their bodies trembled. Their eyes turned fearful. In the next moment, they realized what they had said.

This was the Demon Clan’s ritual. Even domain masters were present. The Demon Lord himself was seated. They had dared to threaten the clan leader in front of so many people—this was clearly slapping the Demon Clan’s face.

Realizing this, cold sweat poured from their aged faces.

Chapter 1083: Eliminating Two Sects with a Single Hand

On the Demon Mountain, the two elders of Ruyi Sect and Fourth-Element Hall had cold sweat streaming down their faces. They gazed at the three elders whose auras were overwhelming, fear in their eyes.
