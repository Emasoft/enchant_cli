If it were an ordinary end-of-epoch era, he could still suppress them in return. But every attack from Luo Tian was overwhelmingly powerful; even he dared not be careless. Sometimes, when struck by Luo Tian, he would spit blood.

“Barbarian flesh truly isn’t ordinary!” Luo Tian continued striking, managing to suppress the barbarian but feeling some surprise in his heart.

“Enough!” Seeing the barbarian continuously suppressed, Man Hun finally couldn’t bear it. His aura of a provisional king level spread out as he materialized before Luo Tian, speaking while extending his hand to grasp him.

Faced with Man Hun, Luo Tian dared not confront directly; his strength hadn’t fully recovered. He let out a cold snort, launching a punch to repel the barbarian and retreat, evading Man Hun’s massive hand. He stood beneath the starry sky, his gaze cold as he looked at the barbarian.

“Don’t think your strength makes you superior!” Luo Tian snorted, returning to Chu Chen’s side.

“You…” The barbarian’s face turned ashen, his lips bleeding continuously, his body aching but nothing compared to the psychological blow of Luo Tian’s words.

“Lord, this is your first time so embarrassed?” The onlookers saw the bruised and battered barbarian. Though unharmed, it was the first time in years they’d seen him so thoroughly dominated—by an end-of-epoch era.

“Do you truly have the confidence to heal our clan’s royal heir?” Man Hun spoke solemnly, his gaze on Luo Tian. He had tolerated Luo Tian all this time to awaken the royal heir.

“If it’s a soul essence issue, no one in the Nine Realms can save him if I cannot!” Luo Tian’s face bore confidence. He knew that the more confident he appeared, the heavier his weight in Man Hun’s eyes.

“Good, state your conditions!” Man Hun nodded, his gaze on Luo Tian before adding: “Of course, if I discover you’re lying, the consequences are self-evident.”

“This is your way of acting! Not like when you were fleeing before me!” Luo Tian inwardly scoffed but maintained his confidence: “Of course, if you find a reason to kill me, the regret might be yours.”

“Rest assured, our clan acts with integrity. If you truly awaken the royal heir, we’ll overlook your past transgressions!” Man Hun emphasized the phrase “overlook past transgressions” heavily.

“Holy Prince!” Hearing Man Hun’s words, the barbarian’s face changed instantly. He felt Man Hun’s “overlook past transgressions” carried another meaning.

“Then it’s settled!” Luo Tian nodded, then addressed the pale Chu Chen: “Come on, elder brother. I’ll take you to avenge!”

Chu Chen was bewildered; he didn’t know the identity of this end-of-epoch era barbarian who dared defy the Tiger Clan.

But upon hearing Luo Tian call him “elder brother,” Chu Chen immediately understood, his face filled with excitement as he nodded heavily.

Luo Tian led Chu Chen outward from the small world, vanishing from Man Hun’s sight.

“Holy Prince, what is your intention?” Seeing Luo Tian leave, the barbarian glared at Man Hun with a questioning gaze. Though Man Hun’s strength was evident, the barbarian was upright.

“Manghuang City has been chaotic; it needs cleansing!” Man Hun smiled, his gaze deepening.

Chapter 1679: "Is that all you have?"

“Cleansing?” Hearing Man Hun’s words, the barbarian and others’ faces changed. They looked at Man Hun, unsure of his meaning.

“Some families have been acting secretly; they’ve contacted other royal clans!” Man Hun’s face bore a hint of coldness as he addressed the barbarian.

“Master Sa Man also foresaw something; soon, our clan might face a great calamity. The royal heir’s return and his prolonged sleep were an omen!” Man Hun spoke coldly.

“Meng Family is one of those families!” Man Hun softly said, his gaze turning icy.

“Chu Chen brought back this man; I felt a familiar aura from him, but forgot where. It’s the perfect chance to investigate Meng Family and see if we can uncover anything!” Man Hun looked at the barbarian.

“What about this man? If Meng Family is innocent, we’d be wasting our effort and cause resentment!” The barbarian frowned, thinking it excessive to decide a family’s fate based on suspicion.

“Don’t worry; if nothing is found, I’ll intervene and stop him!” Man Hun spoke softly.

“Besides, Meng Family is deeply entrenched in Manghuang City; they must have some secrets. This man is end-of-epoch, though strong, but don’t forget Meng Family’s old patriarch is at the peak of the epoch!” Man Hun smiled.

“Lord, if you had another chance to fight him, would you still be suppressed?” Man Hun smiled, turning to the bruised barbarian.

“No!” At this mention, the barbarian’s face reddened as he gritted his teeth.

“What if this man were killed by Meng Family?” Someone asked next.

“I’m here, am I not? Don’t worry; with me around, things won’t get too bad. Regardless, the royal heir’s matter is crucial. If he can’t withstand it, I’ll save him—perfect for breaking this kid’s spirit!” Man Hun smiled proudly. After all, his plan of killing two birds with one stone was his own idea.

“Brilliant! Truly, the Holy Prince’s talent is unmatched!” The people understood Man Hun’s words and wore expressions of admiration, which pleased Man Hun greatly.

“The Holy Prince’s talent is unparalleled. Except for the loss to Luo Tian in human lands, who else could make the Holy Prince suffer? Even now, the royal heir likely couldn’t!” The others spoke softly, gazing at Man Hun. Though he was still the Holy Prince, everyone knew he would eventually become Master Sa Man.

“Hum…” Luo Tian didn’t know what Man Hun and others were thinking; even if he did, it wouldn’t matter. He moved swiftly with Chu Chen toward Meng Family’s domain.

“Elder brother, should we reconsider? Your cultivation hasn’t fully recovered!” On the way, Chu Chen wore a worried expression. Though he knew Luo Tian was powerful, it was still dangerous for him to go to Meng Family now.

“Who are those two?” As they flew, the barbarians suddenly looked puzzled.

“They’re the one who killed Meng Jiyu earlier and then stormed into the Barbarian God Palace!” They immediately recognized Luo Tian.

“The other is Chu Chen; it’s said he broke into the Barbarian God Palace to save Chu Chen. However, he emerged unscathed from the Barbarian God Palace—this is too surprising!” They recalled Luo Tian’s earlier intrusion into the Barbarian God Palace and whispered among themselves.

“Where is he going?” Their gazes followed Luo Tian’s direction, filled with confusion.

But soon, seeing Luo Tian standing in the sky, they were stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Meng Family!” They instantly recognized the place Luo Tian stood—Meng Family, a significant force in Manghuang City.

“Earlier, Meng Family caused trouble for the Southern Ridge people; that person emerged and killed all of Meng Jiyu’s group, then stormed into the Barbarian God Palace and came out unscathed!”

“He also wounded a Barbarian God Guard. Now, he’s even boldly standing at Meng Family—what does he intend to do?” The people of Manghuang City were utterly shocked. It was the first time in years they’d seen such a figure.

“Is this Meng Family?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, gazing at the vast domain. A host of barbarian giants walked within it. Upon Luo Tian’s arrival, they immediately noticed him and Chu Chen, gathering together to gaze at the sky.

“Who are you?” Meng Yunlong stepped forward from the crowd, his eyes narrowing as he saw Chu Chen’s pale face.

“Chu Chen, you…!” Seeing Chu Chen, Meng Yunlong’s face darkened with disbelief.

“You’re who? We haven’t found you yet, but you’ve come to us!” Meng Yunlong scrutinized Luo Tian. He didn’t regard Chu Chen as a threat but focused on Luo Tian, whose overwhelming aura made him uncomfortable.

“Who I am doesn’t matter; what matters is you all die today!” Luo Tian’s face was cold as he waved his hands, summoning a golden hand that crashed down from the sky toward Meng Yunlong.

“Just you!” Meng Yunlong’s face bore mockery, as if he’d heard the funniest joke. He waved his hand, summoning a golden hand to meet Luo Tian’s attack.

“Boom…” A deep sound echoed in Meng Family’s sky, the invisible waves spreading outward.

“Stomp… stomp… stomp…” Meng Yunlong’s massive body retreated repeatedly, his face filled with shock as a building behind him collapsed.

“Strong!” Meng Yunlong looked at the fine cracks on his hand, his heart chilled as he gazed at Luo Tian standing unmoved in the sky.

“Hum…” Luo Tian waved his hand, retrieving Chu Chen because he was about to unleash a massacre and had no time for him.

“Lord!” Just as Luo Tian was about to move, a loud voice echoed from the depths of Meng Family’s domain. A massive figure emerged amidst the crowd, greeted with joy by Meng Family’s people.

The massive body wore a top, its muscles exposed, radiating explosive power. His eyes held ferocity; he was clearly no easy opponent.

“Meng Hongtian!” Recognizing the figure, Meng Family’s people wore joyous faces, even Meng Yunlong smiled.

Meng Hongtian was the second end-of-epoch strength in Meng Family besides Meng Yunlong. He was fierce and combative, cruel and merciless; even family members who angered him would be torn apart by his temper.

However, Meng Yunlong tolerated him due to his strength. Now that Meng Hongtian appeared, it was the first time Meng Family felt joy since Meng Yunlong’s battle with Luo Tian. Everyone could see Meng Yunlong might not be a match for Luo Tian.

“You dare harm our lord! You’re seeking death!” Meng Hongtian’s face darkened upon seeing Meng Yunlong’s bloodied lips. His fierce gaze locked onto Luo Tian, his aura rising like a mountain.

Though Meng Hongtian was hot-tempered, he knew his mistakes. If not for Meng Yunlong repeatedly protecting him, Meng Family might have expelled him long ago. To Meng Hongtian, Meng Yunlong was a benefactor.

“Kill…” Without hesitation, Meng Hongtian’s massive body charged toward Luo Tian with a deep sound.

“Useless; even if another end-of-epoch joined, or even an epoch peak, today you’ll still be annihilated!” Luo Tian snorted. Though Meng Hongtian felt powerful, he was still no match for Luo Tian compared to Meng Yunlong.

“Hum…” Complex patterns rose on Luo Tian’s thick arm, flowing and merging into it. At the same time, Luo Tian stood on empty space without fear, launching a punch toward Meng Hongtian who had arrived.

“Crack…” Thunder roared, the pale blue sky shattered by their collision, revealing black stars in the barbarian realm.

“Boom…” Next moment, a massive figure crashed into Meng Family’s domain like a meteor, collapsing many buildings.

“Cough… cough…” Meng Hongtian spat blood, his eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian standing calmly in the sky.

Silence, death-like silence. Meng Family’s people stared wide-eyed; they hadn’t expected their formidable Meng Hongtian to be sent flying by the man in the sky.

“Again!” Meng Hongtian slowly rose, his eyes showing no defeat but excitement, red light flashing as if Luo Tian had fully awakened his savage aura. He leapt forward faster than before, appearing in front of Luo Tian.

“I’m coming too!” Meng Yunlong instructed his clan members before flying up, his body covered in barbarian patterns, resembling a mountain as he charged toward Luo Tian.

“Just the two of you?” Luo Tian’s lips curled in mockery; though they were troublesome, he wouldn’t fear them.

Chapter 1680: “No one Can Help You”

The sky shattered, three figures colliding in the air. The barbarians focused on physical cultivation, and Luo Tian was skilled at physical combat; thus, he didn’t use his martial arts, as they might be recognized.

Blood rained from the sky; despite fighting two opponents, Luo Tian showed no signs of defeat. His body radiated light, suppressing Meng Yunlong and Meng Hongtian.

“Roar…” Tall figures stood in Meng Family’s domain, shouting loudly, their voices echoing through the heavens. A torrential battle spirit surged toward Luo Tian.

“Rude!” Luo Tian sent Meng Yunlong flying with a punch, gazing at the shouting Meng Family members. He let out a cold snort and, seizing an opening, summoned a golden hand to crush the crowd of Meng Family members.

“Boom…” The massive barbarian giants were instantly destroyed by Luo Tian’s strike, their blood staining the ground.

“Damn!” Meng Yunlong’s face darkened; Luo Tian’s palm had killed hundreds of Meng Family members.

“Don’t worry, it’ll continue! I’ll avenge my brother and the Southern Ridge寨!” Luo Tian endured Meng Hongtian’s punch with his back, his internal energy shaking. He secretly nodded; Meng Hongtian was indeed stronger than Meng Yunlong.

“Kingdom-War Martial Art!” Luo Tian roared, activating his ultimate state to end the fight swiftly.

“Hum…” Activating the Kingdom-War Martial Art, Luo Tian’s physical strength reached its peak. He transformed into a streak of light, appearing before Meng Yunlong.

“Want to kill my brother? This is the cost!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in Meng Yunlong’s ears. A golden fist, radiating unparalleled power, struck Meng Yunlong’s body.

“Crack…” A breaking sound echoed in the sky; blood gushed from Meng Yunlong’s mouth like a fountain, his entire chest caved in. He let out a piercing scream as internal organs spilled with the blood.

“Die!” As Luo Tian severely wounded Meng Yunlong, a furious roar echoed behind him—Meng Hongtian charging again.

“Barbarian God’s Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” Meng Hongtian roared, his aura fierce as he stepped toward Luo Tian.

“Trample the dog’s leg!” Luo Tian’s face bore contempt; he had mastered the Barbarian Step thoroughly, so Meng Hongtian was no match.

With a thunderous roar, Luo Tian’s golden foot rose and kicked Meng Hongtian’s massive foot.

“Boom…” Thunder echoed, the sky shattered. Luo Tian took a few steps back, while Meng Hongtian was instantly sent into the domain beyond.

Their collision lasted only a flash, and as Meng Yunlong climbed from the ground, he saw their clash. His face turned pale.

“How could he be so strong? He couldn’t even fight back!” Meng Yunlong trembled, his eyes filled with terror as he gazed at Luo Tian in the sky.

However, soon after, Luo Tian’s figure distorted in Meng Yunlong’s vision, his残躯 trembling instinctively.

“Hum…” A golden foot descended, Luo Tian’s entire body radiating gold light as he appeared before Meng Yunlong.

“Boom…” Next moment, the entire Meng Family domain trembled; invisible waves spread outward, collapsing buildings like mountains.

Luo Tian’s foot crushed Meng Yunlong’s body into pieces; blood stained Luo Tian’s white robe. At this moment, Luo Tian seemed like a world-destroying god, his eyes cold.

“Die!” Luo Tian extended his hand, a gray soul essence appearing in his grasp—its eyes filled with terror.

“Who is he?” In the barriers of Manghuang City, people stared at Meng Family’s direction with shock, guessing this ruthless man.

“An end-of-epoch Meng Yunlong was crushed by him; how terrifying must his strength be!” Everyone trembled, marveling at Luo Tian’s power.

“More terrifying is that he killed so many people, yet the Barbarian God Palace and the Holy Prince, Old Sa Man, didn’t react at all. They clearly approved!” People were even more shocked that the Holy Prince and others allowed Luo Tian to massacre Meng Family.

“Who are you?” Just as Luo Tian was about to crush Meng Yunlong’s soul essence, a voice echoed from the sky.

“Boom…” The sky trembled; an old barbarian giant stepped forward, instantly appearing in Luo Tian’s view.

“It’s Meng Family’s ancestral ancestor; he must have been awakened!”

“Of course, if Meng Family is about to be annihilated, he’d have no choice but to appear!” The various forces in Manghuang City stood within their array barriers, whispering among themselves.

Meng Wendeh, Meng Family’s ancestral ancestor, one of the six entering the epoch peak in Manghuang City, and Meng Family’s greatest support.

“Do your Meng Family members like to talk so much? You all ask who I am! Who I am doesn’t matter, but you’ll still have to kill me!” Luo Tian sneered, his gaze filled with contempt.

“Not necessarily; if you join Meng Family, I might forgive you!” Meng Wendeh smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“But to join Meng Family, you need to show some sincerity; kill the remnants of the Stone Clan. Then I’ll overlook it. Meng Family is much stronger than the Stone Clan, so joining us is better than following those useless Stone Clans!” Meng Wendeh spoke again, his voice carrying a tone of condescension.

“Truly… a great offer!” Luo Tian held Meng Yunlong’s soul essence in his hand, smiling at Meng Wendeh.

“Did you get moved? If so, act now; first, release him!” Meng Wendeh smiled. Luo Tian’s strength wasn’t seen by him, but just for making Meng Yunlong look like this, it was worth recruiting.

“But I disagree!” Luo Tian’s face showed a cold smile; his hand tightened, and Meng Yunlong’s soul essence screamed before turning into gray mist in Luo Tian’s grasp.

“You!” Seeing Luo Tian turn on him instantly, Meng Wendeh’s face darkened, especially seeing Meng Yunlong dead. His eyes flashed with killing intent.

“You’re seeking death!” Meng Wendeh roared, charging toward Luo Tian. His epoch peak aura pressed down on Luo Tian.

“Epoch peak? That’s more fun!” Luo Tian’s face bore battle spirit; though the opponent was epoch peak, he wasn’t a pushover. His own realm and eyes were there.

“Roar…” Just as Luo Tian was about to counter Meng Wendeh, a roar echoed from the sky. A blood-red streak pierced through the heavens, descending toward Luo Tian.

“Meng Hongtian?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his expression turning serious; another dilemma.

In his vision, Meng Hongtian wielded a massive hammer, descending from the sky as if piercing through it. Instantly, he arrived above Luo Tian, making Luo Tian feel this attack was no simple matter; if mishandled, he might suffer serious injuries.

Meanwhile, Meng Wendeh, an epoch peak, his attack was also formidable, making Luo Tian feel the crisis.

But Luo Tian only thought for a moment before rushing toward Meng Wendeh, as if waiting any longer would mean both attacks arriving simultaneously, which even he couldn’t withstand.

With a thunderous roar, Luo Tian stood on empty space, launching a punch toward Meng Wendeh’s old fist.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed again; both men flew backward instantly, but Luo Tian’s mouth spat blood, his eyes showing a bitter smile.

“Boom…” At the same time, the blood-red hammer appeared behind Luo Tian; fine cracks spread around it.

“Eight Directions Collapse!” Luo Tian roared, invisible waves radiating from his body, forming complex energy that acted upon the blood-red hammer.

“Hum…” The overwhelming hammer, under the effect of Eight Directions Collapse, lessened slightly but still smashed onto Luo Tian’s back.

“Spit…!” Blood spewed from Luo Tian’s mouth; he endured Meng Hongtian’s full-force attack, suffering injuries. However, the Eight Directions Collapse reduced the hammer’s power; otherwise, it wouldn’t just be spitting blood.

“How is this possible!” Meng Hongtian’s face bore disbelief; his hammer, even against an end-of-epoch, could make someone pay a price. Yet this man only spat some blood.

“Now it’s my turn; I’ll just run if needed!” Luo Tian waved his hands, generating a golden vortex. The Intercepting Heaven Seal instantly radiated powerful energy, crushing Meng Hongtian.

“This… is a martial art!” Meng Hongtian’s face bore disbelief, sensing the powerful aura from the seal. His expression darkened.

“Boom…” The golden seal instantly descended, crushing Meng Hongtian’s massive body.

“Boom…” A deafening explosion rose from Meng Family, violent waves spreading again. Meng Hongtian’s body was crushed into blood mist by the powerful winds.

Chapter 1681: “Rebellion”

“His martial art is so powerful!” The people of Manghuang City were shocked, feeling the pressure from the golden seal. Their eyes showed disbelief.

The barbarians focused on physical cultivation, so they weren’t sensitive to martial arts; few could master powerful ones. Thus, most only knew the first three forms of Barbarian Step and some body-strengthening techniques. Few had strong martial arts.

Now, Luo Tian’s powerful martial art caused a stir among the barbarians; they hadn’t expected their clan to have such techniques.

“Damn, it’s him!” Man Hun sat in his courtyard, his face filled with anger. He instantly recognized Luo Tian’s Intercepting Heaven Seal.

“Of course, I felt something familiar!” Man Hun’s face darkened; he waved his hands, sending out waves. The sacred weapons of the barbarian kings hovering above the Barbarian God Palace glowed, instantly enveloping the entire barbarian continent and isolating it from the star domain.

“Luo Tian!” How could Man Hun not recognize Luo Tian’s Intercepting Heaven Seal? He had been chased to the point of fleeing by him in Sea Corner, forced to hand over Barbarian Step. Later, on the human clan battlefield, Luo Tian had shone brightly and used Intercepting Heaven Seal again. How could he forget?

“Fool!” After activating the Wolf Fang Staff to seal the entire barbarian continent, Man Hun gritted his teeth but still didn’t act. After all, Sa Man had once gone to the Star Moon Clan to invite Luo Tian to awaken Chen Zhanbiao.

“Luo Tian!” Not only did Man Hun recognize Luo Tian, but some barbarian elders who had participated in attacking the Nine Realms also recognized him. After all, Intercepting Heaven Seal was too obvious.

“Stay calm!” Man Hun’s eyes bore frustration as he addressed the eager elders, suppressing them. He couldn’t attack Luo Tian but had to help him clean up the mess, restraining those barbarian elders.

“Holy Prince, he’s a human!” Someone whispered to Man Hun, their voice filled with urgency. “Now all the ancient clans are hunting him. With his strength reduced, it’s the perfect chance to capture him!”

“If other royal clans learn we protected Luo Tian, they’ll surely cause trouble!” The barbarians who recognized Luo Tian kept whispering to Man Hun, considering him an unstable factor that might bring great trouble.

“Suppress your clan’s people; don’t reveal Luo Tian’s presence in the barbarian continent!” Man Hun gritted his teeth, regretting deeply. He should’ve never used Luo Tian as a pawn; otherwise, he wouldn’t have exposed him so early.

“Nothing?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with light, feeling no barbarian elders rushing toward him. His face naturally showed a smile.

“Come here!” Luo Tian extended his hand, Meng Hongtian’s soul essence drifting from the blood mist toward him.

“Barbarian God’s Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” Just as Luo Tian was about to destroy Meng Hongtian, a low voice echoed from the sky. Meng Wendeh’s golden foot descended, radiating an aura to crush everything, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Unexpectedly, you are that human!” Meng Wendeh’s heart was also shocked but his eyes showed excitement.

Luo Tian, a near-king level powerhouse; currently at end-of-epoch, clearly his strength had dropped. If he could kill Luo Tian, it would be a major achievement!

Killing the human clan’s prodigy, a pillar of the human clan—Meng Wendeh had never imagined it. After all, Luo Tian had slain a royal heir.

“Wendeh elder, I’ll help you!” Just as Meng Wendeh’s golden foot descended, a rough voice echoed from the sky. A tall figure appeared above Meng Family’s domain, his face also filled with excitement.

“It’s the Zhang Family’s ancestral ancestor; he has arrived!” People saw this tall figure and gasped, for this Zhang Family’s ancestral ancestor was also one of the six new epoch peaks in Manghuang City, Duan Hongfang.

“Haha, I’m here too!” Before Duan Hongfang’s voice faded, another loud laugh echoed. Epoch peak aura spread across the sky, and a tall figure instantly appeared before Duan Hongfang, his eyes filled with excitement as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“It’s Cheng Zhengqing, the pillar of the Cheng Family; why is he here to deal with this person!” The people of Manghuang City instantly recognized the old man.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s body retreated, spitting blood again as he landed on Meng Family’s ground. His two legs sank deeply into the earth, fine cracks spreading around his feet.

“Three of them?” Man Hun sat in his courtyard, his eyes gleaming coldly. He had clearly told the elders to suppress their clan’s people, but two still emerged—clearly something was wrong.

“What’s going on?” The people of Manghuang City were stunned, their eyes filled with confusion. They didn’t know why the two had suddenly appeared or why they attacked this person who troubled Meng Family. After all, even the Barbarian God Palace and Man Hun hadn’t said anything about it.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, also unsure why two more had appeared. If it was Man Hun’s doing, he would have directly come to capture or kill him—why go through the trouble of sending two epoch peaks?

“You three!” Meng Wendeh furrowed his brow, looking at the two and exchanging glances.

“Kill this kid!” Duan Hongfang and Cheng Zhengqing spoke, then their massive bodies trembled as they charged toward Luo Tian.

“Holy Prince, should we act?” Man Cheng sat before Man Hun, his face cold. Without looking, with Meng Wendeh included, the “toxic tumor” Man Hun spoke of was these three.

“No rush; just them three can’t stir up much trouble. I wonder if they’ll bring out their masters!” Man Hun’s face was cold as he spoke to Man Cheng.

The entire Manghuang City had six epoch peaks besides Man Cheng; half of them emerged, making Man Hun’s face dark.

“Can this kid withstand it?” Man Cheng also wore a cold expression as he asked Man Hun.

“Don’t worry; three epoch peaks are just that. If he couldn’t withstand it, he wouldn’t be here now!” Man Hun sneered and replied softly.

“Three epoch peaks… just that…” The people around Man Cheng and Man Hun, upon hearing Man Hun’s words, had their mouths twitching.

“Kid, you’re really bold to appear again!” Meng Wendeh and the two others bore coldness on their faces, gazing down at Luo Tian from above. They couldn’t imagine that the one they once looked up to was now being suppressed by them.

“Old man, though I don’t know who you’re following, since you’ve appeared, you must have some confidence. But if you insist on seeking death, I’ll grant it! You’re not worth anything; even with reduced strength, killing you is like slaughtering dogs!” Luo Tian’s face bore contempt as he coldly replied.

“Death is near, yet you still talk back!” Duan Hongfang’s face bore a cold smile. To him, Luo Tian was now meat on the chopping block, unable to turn back.

“Even a powerhouse who lived two lives couldn’t kill me; you three epoch peaks say this? I really want to ask who gave you the courage!” Luo Tian smiled, not wanting to waste words on them.

“Kill!” Meng Wendeh and the two others bore coldness, stepping forward with three heavy feet like pillars, rushing toward Luo Tian.

But just as they thought Luo Tian would be dead under their attacks, a thunderous sound echoed. A green lightning appeared in Luo Tian’s hand, instantly expanding and illuminating his face. An unparalleled aura radiated from the green lightning.

“Dao Without Borders!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, thunder flashing as waves of lightning erupted from his hand. They instantly swept around, enveloping the entire Meng Family domain.

“Apocalypse!” The lightning was massive, instantly covering Meng Family’s domain with a terrifying storm of thunder.

“Shriek…” A pitiful scream echoed in Meng Family’s domain, as one by one, the Meng people were annihilated. Some didn’t even have time to scream before turning into a wisp of smoke and being wiped out.

“That’s the aura of a royal weapon!” The barbarians were stunned, recognizing the green sword in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Cough… cough…” Three battered figures appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, their faces filled with horror.

“Damn! He has a royal weapon!” Meng Wendeh and the two others’ faces darkened, gazing at Luo Tian holding the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword.

“Sword Without Borders!” Before they could react, a cold voice echoed again. Thunder flashed, and Luo Tian vanished from their sight.

“Block it!” Meng Wendeh and the two others’ faces darkened, raising a barrier in front of them.

“Crack…” As their barriers were raised, the sound of breaking echoed in their ears. A green lightning streaked through Meng Wendeh’s back, piercing his heart.
