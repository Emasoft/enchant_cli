The middle-aged man was a Master Alchemist from the Third Island, often coming to this trading market to purchase medicinal herbs. If he offended him, his business might lose a customer. Moreover, Master Alchemists from the Third Island were inherently superior to ordinary people; thus, most stall owners preferred not to offend them if possible.

However, the stall owner saw Luotian's terrifying aura and his effortless dismissal of the alchemist. He realized Luotian was no easy opponent, leaving him momentarily flustered.

"Who is he?" Luotian noticed the stall owner's hesitation and turned to Shen Gong Fei Chi, asking.

"He is a First-Grade Master Alchemist from the Third Island—Zhao Wuliang!" Shen Gong Fei Chi explained the middle-aged man's background.

"Oh, so he is an alchemist from the Third Island!" Luotian rubbed his chin, gazing at Zhao Wuliang before slowly approaching him.

"Did Hu Jianan send you?" Luotian's lips curled slightly as he asked Zhao Wuliang.

"No!" Zhao Wuliang replied defiantly, believing Luotian wouldn't dare harm him. After all, he was a Master Alchemist, considered top-tier within the Third Island.

"Poof!" Luotian kicked Zhao Wuliang's Dan Tian, and a crackling sound echoed. A surge of sacred power erupted from Zhao Wuliang's body, dispersing as crimson winds across the surroundings.

"You!" Zhao Wuliang's face turned pale. He felt excruciating pain in his Dan Tian, watching the scattered sacred power—there was no doubt he had been crippled.

"Buzz..." Luotian didn't stop after crushing Zhao Wuliang's Dan Tian. He extended a hand, and the Dao's power spread, instantly rushing into Zhao Wuliang's Dan Tian. His face bore a cold glint.

"Third Island Master Alchemist Zhao Wuliang, colliding with the Third Island's Deputy Lord. I hereby declare his cultivation nullified and expel him from the Third Island!" Luotian's cold voice cut through the trading market, causing people to shiver involuntarily.

After speaking, Luotian immediately displayed the Deputy Lord's token. The crowd gasped, their gazes toward Luotian shifting.

"Spit...!" Zhao Wuliang coughed up two mouthfuls of black blood. He sensed his Dan Tian could no longer heal, as if he had reverted to an ordinary person.

"This!" The middle-aged man who had previously stolen Luotian's Tongling Flower trembled, standing among the crowd. His face was pale; he hadn't expected Luotian to be so ruthless, instantly crippling a First-Grade Master Alchemist.

"This Deputy Lord isn't simple," people murmured, silently sighing at Luotian's cold-bloodedness.

"Regrettable. If Hu Tianzong appeared, he'd surely seek revenge against this Luotian! Who doesn't know that all Third Island alchemists are under Grand Alchemist Hu Jianan's control?"

"Deserved. It saves us from these alchemists' arrogance!"

"Exactly! I've long wanted to beat these alchemists. Last time, they demanded five batches of medicinal herbs for my single batch—too greedy! A lesson was needed!" The crowd murmured, some expressing regret while others cheered.

"Master Deputy Lord, I've found this Tongling Grass. Please take it back!" The middle-aged man who had bought medicinal herbs before approached Luotian, bowing respectfully and handing him a storage pouch. His forehead was drenched in sweat.

"Damn, this Deputy Lord can't be得罪d. He's too ruthless! That one glance nearly killed me!" The man trembled internally.

"Ah, well," Luotian naturally accepted the pouch without hesitation. His gaze swept over the crowd with renewed authority.

Several middle-aged men slowly lowered their heads—these were the alchemists ordered by Hu Jianan to trouble Luotian. Now, seeing his power, they dared not act further.

"Go!" Luotian kicked Zhao Wuliang like a dead dog, then led Shen Gong Fei Chi deeper into the trading market.

This time, Luotian succeeded smoothly. He spent all 100,000 Qi Stones to purchase ample medicinal herbs and a decent alchemical cauldron. Satisfied, he walked toward the trading market's exit.

"Fortune-telling! Foretelling destiny!" As they neared the exit, a voice called out. Luotian's eyes narrowed in confusion.

"Fortune-telling?" He thought he'd misheard. How could a fortune-teller appear on the Seven Star Island?

Curious, he approached the crowd. A blind old man in tattered Daoist robes stood there, his eyes devoid of color. He carried a white sail with the Eight Trigrams painted on it.

"Old man, how do you predict?" someone asked out of curiosity.

"I only foretell for those destined to meet me. Today, I sensed my disciple would arrive, inheriting my secret of longevity!" The old man rolled his eyes, shaking his head like a charlatan.

"Ha! Longevity secrets? Your mouth is bold!" The crowd laughed, dismissing him as mad and leaving.

"Shen Gong Fei Chi, give him a few Qi Stones," Luotian shook his head and instructed Shen Gong Fei Chi.

"Sure!" Shen Gong Fei Chi complied, retrieving a few Qi Stones. His face showed reluctance; for him, it was a significant expense.

"Master Deputy Lord's gift. Find a place to change into clean clothes," Shen Gong Fei Chi placed the Qi Stones before the old man.

"Ha! My dear disciple, come and be my student! I'll teach you longevity secrets to make you invincible!" The blind old man smiled, his tattered sail swaying as he gazed toward Luotian.

"Madman!" Luotian turned away, thinking the old blind man pitiable. He'd given him a few Qi Stones, but now this madman wanted to attach himself.

"Let's go!" Luotian waved to Shen Gong Fei Chi and walked toward his residence.

"Hmph. Daring to be our Deputy Lord's master? Bold talk! Our Deputy Lord's cultivation is already enough for disciples!" Shen Gong Fei Chi wanted to reclaim the Qi Stones but found the old blind man had already taken them, playing with them in his hands.

"Relax. He'll seek me out," the old man said, rising slowly and using his tattered sail as a walking stick. He walked away step by step.

"Madman!" Shen Gong Fei Chi muttered, chasing after Luotian without another glance at the old man.

Yet, in an instant, the old blind man vanished from the trading market as if he'd never existed.

Luotian remained unaware, smiling as he stood in his courtyard. He waved a hand, summoning the cauldron he'd bought at the market.

"Make do. Regrettable, the碧晶琉璃火 (Bijing Lilu Fire) is gone!" Luotian sighed, feeling a slight discomfort.

"Long since I've alchemized. Let me try with a First-Grade Sacred Alchemy!" Luotian waved his hand, red flames leaping from it and entering the cauldron.

Though a bit rusty, his foundation was solid. He placed each medicinal herb into the cauldron, leaving Shen Gong Fei Chi dazzled.

Shen Gong Fei Chi had expected Luotian to alchemize but hadn't anticipated his skill. He'd once seen Grand Alchemist Hu Jianan alchemize, but Shen Gong Fei Chi felt Hu Jianan's techniques were a world apart from Luotian's.

While Shen Gong Fei Chi marveled, Luotian placed the final herbs into the cauldron and began melting the elixir. Though slightly awkward, it was successfully melted.

Refining the pills came naturally; he pressed the cauldron's lid, and golden elixirs soared from it.

"Boom..." Golden thunderclaps descended upon the elixir, fully solidifying it. Luotian caught it in a jade vial within half an hour.

"This... is it?" Shen Gong Fei Chi gaped at the vial in Luotian's hand, disbelief etched on his face.

"Here, for you!" Luotian handed the vial to Shen Gong Fei Chi, his expression indifferent.

Shen Gong Fei Chi quickly uncorked the vial. A powerful essence of herbs surged into his spirit.

"This!" Shen Gong Fei Chi, no novice, recognized the elixir's herb essence. Compared to ordinary pills, it was immeasurably stronger. His eyes glowed with excitement.

"Deputy Lord... what level of alchemist are you?" Shen Gong Fei Chi stammered, gazing at Luotian.

"Probably a High-Grade Master. Though I've only ever alchemized one high-grade elixir," Luotian shook his head, then pressed the fire mouth again.

Chapter 1244: Visit()

"Boom..." Thunderclaps incessantly fell from the sky, striking Luotian's temporary residence. Each elixir he alchemized left Shen Gong Fei Chi awestruck.

For two days, Luotian never stopped. His frenzy was unprecedented in Shen Gong Fei Chi's life.

At this point, Luotian's courtyard was unrecognizable. Even surrounding courtyards were flattened by the powerful thunderclaps.

The commotion was massive. Initially, no one paid much attention—after all, the Third Island had many alchemists. But as time passed, people noticed something was amiss: the thunderclaps were all concentrated in Luotian's courtyard.

"Two days and nights, alchemizing nonstop. Who is this person? So疯狂! And the strength of these thunderclaps—most are First-Grade, with one even Second-Grade!" The Third Island's alchemists were stunned, gazing at Luotian's courtyard. Some had already gathered around it, seeing Luotian standing there.

"Deputy Lord!" People discovered Luotian and Shen Gong Fei Chi, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Deputy Lord can alchemize?" They murmured, surprised Luotian's cultivation and alchemy skills were equally formidable.

"Boom!" As they marveled, Luotian roared and struck the cauldron. It shattered into fragments across the ground.

"Boom..." A thick vitality dispersed in the air, and Luotian sighed: "Ah, I couldn't hold on!"

Luotian shook his head, ignoring the bewildered gazes. He waved away the vitality and pondered where to find a suitable cauldron.

"Sell these elixirs. You know their value! Then find a way to buy me a better cauldron!" Luotian handed all the elixirs he'd alchemized over to Shen Gong Fei Chi.

"Yes!" Shen Gong Fei Chi's face lit up. He knew the elixirs' worth. After two days of observation, he finally understood why Luotian had called his elixir garbage.

Compared to Luotian's, his own seemed like trash. Imagining the elixirs' impact on the Seven Star Island, Shen Gong Fei Chi's face was filled with joy, as if envisioning countless Qi Stones being collected.

"Deputy Lord, rest assured. I'll definitely recover every penny!" Shen Gong Fei Chi patted his plump belly, confident as he made a promise. Like his brother Shen Gong Fu, he never took losses—born to be a merchant.

"Go!" Luotian sat cross-legged, restoring his sacred power. Two days of nonstop alchemy had left him exhausted.

Others, seeing no more spectacle, dispersed. Yet some curious individuals followed Shen Gong Fei Chi toward the trading market.

Time passed slowly. Luotian fully restored his sacred power after a day, opening his eyes to see a robust figure standing one hundred zhang away—cold and motionless.

"Ah? I didn't notice him arriving?" Luotian's brow furrowed, gazing at Yang Jinghua standing before him.

"Yang Brother arrived early," Luotian stood, approaching Yang Jinghua and bowing.

"Speak. What's the plan?" Yang Jinghua, not one for words, spoke calmly.

"Don't rush. Once my cauldron and herbs arrive, I'll cure it completely!" Luotian smiled, gazing at Yang Jinghua. For some reason, he found Yang Jinghua likable.

Previously, Luotian had seen a strange force within Yang Jinghua's body through his Zhiji Magic Eyes. Though faint, it was dangerous—like a constant threat to devour Yang Jinghua. Luotian knew this force belonged to the蛮族 (Barbarians).

"Curse!" Luotian had once stayed in the Nangling Stone寨 (Stone Village), discussing with tribal chief Shi Changshan. He understood the Barbarians' methods. Curses were one of their unique techniques.

Barbarians focused on physical strength and sacred power, which lagged far behind humans. But their other method was these curses.

"Curse?" Yang Jinghua's expression changed upon hearing Luotian's mutter. Frequent dealings with the Barbarians and his status as a key figure on the Seven Star Island made him aware of their curse's danger. He knew curses were terrifying.

The stronger the curse caster, the more fearsome the curse—gradually eroding the victim's soul and body until they perished in torment.

"The Barbarians truly respect me!" Yang Jinghua's face showed a bitter smile, shaking his head.

"Rest assured. I said there was a way, and there is. Shen Gong Fei Chi should return soon. Once the cauldron arrives, I'll alchemize a pill to counter this curse!" Luotian's eyes gleamed with excitement. He thought of the ancient formulas from the Stone Village, eager to see if they could produce something extraordinary.

As Luotian anxiously waited, the trading market erupted. Shen Gong Fei Chi's plump face glowed with excitement, his eyes scanning the crowd around him as if eyeing fat sheep.

"Everyone, don't crowd. This elixir is the last one left—highest bidder wins!" Shen Gong Fei Chi shouted, his voice like thunder, shaking everyone around him. His gaze fell on the jade vial in his hand.

"Is this the elixir alchemized by the Third Island's new Deputy Lord?" People stared hungrily at Shen Gong Fei Chi and the vial.

"I'll bid five ten thousand Qi Stones..."

"I'll bid eight ten thousand..." Voices quickly rose, each price making Shen Gong Fei Chi's heart tremble.

The last First-Grade Sacred Elixir was sold for fifteen ten thousand Qi Stones to a Superpower-level disciple. For Shen Gong Fei Chi, it was a fortune—especially with over two million Qi Stones in his storage pouch. He'd never imagined possessing such wealth.

"Apologies, everyone. The elixirs are sold out. Deputy Lord said he accepts pre-orders now, but you must submit herbs first. The price will naturally be a bit higher, but your elixirs will be alchemized first. Only ten spots daily—pre-order quickly!" Shen Gong Fei Chi spoke with a sly tone, his voice filled with pride. When had he ever been so prosperous?

Slyness aside, Shen Gong Fei Chi hadn't forgotten Luotian's task: find the best cauldron in the trading market.

"The best cauldron!" Shen Gong Fei Chi's small eyes narrowed, then gleamed with determination.

"Ha! The best cauldron is the Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron!"

"I'm a genius! Ha! Deputy Lord will surely praise me!" Shen Gong Fei Chi laughed, vanishing into the trading market.

As Shen Gong Fei Chi left, the trading market erupted again. The Third Island's Deputy Lord Luotian's name had just begun to settle, but it was now sweeping across the Seven Star Island.

"This elixir!" Hu Jianan held a round, smooth pill in his hand, eyes wide with surprise.

"The essence of herbs is so rich. How did he achieve this? His technique—its saturation level is far higher!" Hu Jianan's face was stunned. As key figures in the Seven Star Island's alchemists, they could sense Luotian's elixir was extraordinary.

"Who is this person? His strength is formidable. His alchemy skills might even surpass mine! Whether melting herbs or refining pills, I've never seen such techniques!" Hu Jianan was puzzled.

"Even if he's a genius, with those three people acting, this time he'll surely be humiliated and brought down!" Hu Jianan's face bore a cold smile, gazing at Luotian's residence.

Luotian and Yang Jinghua stood in the ruins scorched by thunderclaps. Yang Jinghua was a quiet man, like a pillar, standing without a word.

After waiting three hours, time approached midnight. Yang Jinghua stood, sweat streaming down his face, his eyes gradually filled with blood. His body emitted a low growl, as if a beast tore within him.

"Endure!" Luotian extended his hand, and the Dao's power surged into Yang Jinghua's body to combat the curse.

"Ah?" But immediately, Luotian noticed his Dao power was devoured by the curse.

"A formidable curse!" Luotian hadn't expected the Barbarians' curse to be so strong—even his Dao power was devoured by it.

Yet the curse, though powerful, delayed its spread. Yang Jinghua's complexion improved slightly.

"A tough man!" Luotian sighed, gazing at Yang Jinghua. He could imagine the pain Yang Jinghua endured.

"Deputy Lord, I'm back!" As Luotian marveled, Shen Gong Fei Chi's plump figure approached, his face filled with pride.

Chapter 1245: Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron()

"Finally! Did you get everything?" Luotian's eyes lit up as he saw Shen Gong Fei Chi.

"Deputy Lord, I'll make you satisfied!" Shen Gong Fei Chi placed a storage pouch into Luotian's hands.

"Good!" Luotian's eyes brightened. The pouch contained various herbs, some of high grade. He even sensed the aura of a Sacred Herb, praising Shen Gong Fei Chi's efficiency.

"Ha! Deputy Lord, this is nothing. Wait until you see the next thing—your eyes will pop out!" Shen Gong Fei Chi's face showed arrogance, already imagining Luotian's reaction to the cauldron he'd prepared.

"Stop talking. Get it out!" Yang Jinghua's voice was cold, sweat dripping from his face.

Shen Gong Fei Chi's plump body instinctively trembled. He didn't know why, but he felt an innate fear of Yang Jinghua.

"Good!" Shen Gong Fei Chi waved his hand. A heavy aura rose, making Luotian and Yang Jinghua's gazes serious.

"Buzz..." The energy spread. It was now midnight. For some reason, the sky turned dark. But as Shen Gong Fei Chi summoned the cauldron, seven shining stars appeared in Luotian's view.

"Roar..." Seven black dragons coiled beneath the stars, resembling a dragon, circling the dark cauldron.

The seven stars descended, etched into the dragons' eyes like dragon eyes. The cauldron radiated a powerful aura.

At that moment, Luotian was captivated by the cauldron. As an alchemist, a cauldron was as vital as his hands. A good cauldron was crucial for an advanced alchemist.

"This... is the Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron! How did you obtain it?" Yang Jinghua's face showed disbelief, gazing at Shen Gong Fei Chi.

"A pseudo-era treasure, refined by an era master. It was used to alchemize a single elixir—extremely precious!" Yang Jinghua explained the cauldron's origin. As a top-tier talent of the Seven Star Island, he recognized this cauldron.

Seeing Yang Jinghua's astonishment, Shen Gong Fei Chi's pride deepened. He crossed his arms: "Who am I? I'm Shen Gong Fei Chi! How clever I am! Ha!"

"How much did it cost?" Luotian's eyes gleamed with excitement. He never expected Shen Gong Fei Chi to obtain such a cauldron. How much it cost was irrelevant; for Luotian, this cauldron was priceless, worth every sacrifice.

"Two hundred thousand Qi Stones. Deputy Lord, isn't it valuable?" Shen Gong Fei Chi's face showed pride, puffing out his belly as he spoke.

"Valuable! Too damn valuable!" Luotian longed to kiss Shen Gong Fei Chi. Two hundred thousand Qi Stones for a cauldron refined by an era master—no matter the cost, two hundred billion would be worth it.

"Great! Luotian gently caressed the patterns on the Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron, his eyes filled with affection. He was certain that using this cauldron would increase his success rate to eighty percent.

"Two hundred thousand? Impossible!" Yang Jinghua's face showed disbelief. He knew the Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron was precious, comparable to the Seven Star Sword. How could Shen Gong Fu sell it?

Hearing Yang Jinghua's words, Luotian calmed down. He gazed at Shen Gong Fei Chi, hoping he was truthful.

"Two hundred thousand Qi Stones. Rented!" Shen Gong Fei Chi still crossed his arms, pride on his face—yet Luotian's lips twitched.

"Damn!" Luotian cursed Shen Gong Fei Chi for not clarifying. He also felt two hundred thousand Qi Stones couldn't obtain such a treasure, even in the low-cost Seven Star Island.

"Ah, never mind. How many days did you rent it for?" Luotian sighed deeply, disappointment on his face as he asked Shen Gong Fei Chi.

"One day!" Shen Gong Fei Chi replied, still proud, waving a plump finger.

"Damn it!" Luotian muttered under his breath. One day—what a scam! Two hundred thousand Qi Stones for just one day.

"Good job, I negotiated with the Lord to rent it! This is my clever plan. No one else in the Seven Star Island could think of renting a Thunderclap Cauldron!" Shen Gong Fei Chi's face was proud, shouting.

"Indeed, you're really clever!" Luotian glared at the Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron, wanting to slap Shen Gong Fei Chi's plump face.

"Maybe your cheap uncle is grateful now!" Luotian sighed, doubting if Shen Gong Fei Chi was placed by Shen Gong Fu to sabotage him.

"Damn, it's two hundred thousand Qi Stones! It's gone!" Luotian mentally screamed. If in the Nine Realms, he wouldn't care about two hundred thousand Qi Stones, but on the Barbarian Continent, it was precious.

Meanwhile, Shen Gong Fu's eyes gleamed with excitement. He gazed at the accumulated Qi Stones beside him, nodding repeatedly: "Shen Gong Fei Chi's kid really has some brains. He thought of renting a cauldron—this means the Third Island will gain another revenue stream!"

Shen Gong Fu was satisfied, storing the Qi Stones and smiling as if seeing countless Qi Stones flying toward him.

"Get lost..." Luotian kicked Shen Gong Fei Chi out after he kept boasting about negotiating with Shen Gong Fu. He waved a hand, sending him home.

"Boom..." Shen Gong Fei Chi's face showed confusion. His thick buttocks met the ground, kicking up dust.

"Ah... Deputy Lord must think I'm tired. He sent me back himself. Unfortunately, the method was a bit off—my butt still hurts!" Shen Gong Fei Chi's face showed pride, patting the dust off and entering his room.

"How about it? Is this method feasible?" Yang Jinghua's face showed hope, gazing at Luotian.

"It should be fine!" Luotian's eyes gleamed with confidence, patting the Thunderclap Cauldron. With it, his success rate would be higher.

"Trouble!" Yang Jinghua spoke softly. If others knew, they'd be shocked—Yang Jinghua was iron-fisted and never said thanks.

"Receiving money to do a favor!" Luotian spoke, then fell silent. He adjusted his state, red flames leaping into the Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron.

"Roar..." The red flames erupted upon entering the cauldron, radiating terrifying heat on Luotian's face.

"It enhances fire!" Luotian marveled, more reluctant to return the cauldron. He felt reassured—without the碧晶琉璃火 (Bijing Lilu Fire), his own flames could alchemize elixirs but lacked temperature. With this enhancement, he was confident in producing the震天丹 (Zhen Tian Dan).

Yes, Luotian aimed to alchemize the Zhen Tian Dan. Its power would suppress Yang Jinghua's curse.

Curses were terrifying, but the Zhen Tian Dan could withstand a divine strike. How could it fear a curse?

"Buzz..." Luotian threw hundreds of herbs into the cauldron as if they were worthless, his face growing serious.

"He really has skill!" Yang Jinghua marveled, gazing at Luotian's technique. His hope grew.

After an hour of alchemizing, Luotian sighed deeply.

"Last ingredient!" Luotian smiled, extending a hand. A drop of milky liquid flew from his palm—stone milk exchanged from Yang Jinghua, comparable to a Sacred Herb.

After returning to his residence, Luotian had extracted the stone milk from the rock. He'd obtained three drops; this one was used for the Zhen Tian Dan.

The fragrance spread, filling a hundred miles with aroma. Third Island residents who had rested were drawn out to find the source.

"Concentrate..." Luotian fused the stone milk into the Thunderclap Cauldron. His vast spiritual awareness pressed it into the already merged herbal liquid.

"Buzz..." The sound echoed. Under Luotian's spiritual awareness, white smoke rose from the cauldron, and the fragrance intensified, spreading across the Third Island.

Time passed slowly. After half an hour, Luotian felt his spiritual awareness nearly depleted. The cauldron gradually formed the elixir's shape.

"Damn, this stone milk is extremely cold. It's hard to refine!" Luotian felt troubled; sweat dripped from his head.

"Preparation was insufficient," Luotian sighed inwardly. He had only slightly adjusted his state before alchemizing—this was a cardinal sin for an alchemist.

"This elixir is ruined!" Luotian felt his spiritual awareness was insufficient. Two days of high-intensity alchemy, though he'd rested, wasn't his peak state.

"Never mind. No need to waste spiritual awareness and sacred power. It's a pity for this drop of stone milk!" Luotian shook his head.

"Roar..." But as Luotian was about to give up, a low roar echoed from the Thunderclap Cauldron.

Chapter 1246: Never Ending()

"Roar..." The low roar echoed from the Seven Star Thunderclap Cauldron, making Luotian's spiritual awareness stir.

Before he could react, the seven black dragons on the cauldron's eyes burst with light. Stars erupted, and the dragons seemed to awaken.

"This..." Luotian was stunned. Seven black dragons appeared in his spiritual awareness, swirling around the forming elixir.

A terrifying pressure descended upon Luotian's spiritual awareness wrapped around the elixir, making it re-form.

"Go!" Luotian extended a hand. A drop of blood flew from his palm, merging into the elixir. It instantly turned crimson.

"Refined!" Luotian laughed, pressing the cauldron's lid. A powerful aura rose, and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

"Boom..." Before the elixir could exit the cauldron, thunderclaps echoed from the sky.

"Crack..." Under the black sky, a supreme authority loomed. A water-tube-thick blood-red lightning formed a dragon, roaring toward the Zhen Tian Dan as if to devour it.

"This supreme aura—divine power!" Upon the blood-red lightning's arrival, Yang Jinghua sensed its divine essence.

"Divine power! Someone has ascended? Why choose this place for a thunderclap?" Soon, the Third Island was in chaos. Figures flew from their residences, gazing at the blood-red dragon in the sky.

"It's Luotian's residence. Again it is!" People flew toward Luotian's direction. The commotion from two days was too much.

"What elixir is this? It summoned divine lightning!" Figures surrounded Luotian's residence, gazing at the elixir floating in the sky.

At the same time, the blood-red lightning descended upon the Zhen Tian Dan. The elixir was drenched in crimson lightning.

"An extraordinary elixir, but can it withstand divine power?" People shook their heads. Though they felt Luotian's elixir was remarkable, they didn't believe it could endure. After all, divine power—though a fragment—was beyond an elixir's strength.

But the next moment, their eyes widened in disbelief. They rubbed their eyes, thinking they were still asleep.

The blood-red Zhen Tian Dan emitted a buzzing sound. It devoured the lightning, as if an endless hole.

"What's going on!" People were stunned. They hadn't expected Luotian to alchemize an elixir that could devour divine lightning.

"It's done!" Luotian smiled, catching the blood-red Zhen Tian Dan in his hand and sealing it.

"The Barbarians' ancient formulas truly have unique merits. Even divine power can be absorbed!" Luotian was also awestruck.

"Unknown what other formulas hold. I'm eager to alchemize the remaining elixirs!" Luotian's heart was excited.

"Deputy Lord, will you sell this elixir?" Someone asked, their voice filled with excitement. Immediately, someone wanted to buy the elixir.
