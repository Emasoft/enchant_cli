“Ah…” Yu Haonan and his companions were instantly overwhelmed by the dense wood and plant energy, gazing at the ethereal figures above before they erupted outward.

The wood and plant energy surged across the market, sending a tremor through everyone's minds, their gazes drawn to the pills in Yu Haonan’s hand.

Gleaming like jade, emerald-green pills rested in Yu Haonan's palm, causing his eyes to gleam with excitement. He could feel the immense medicinal potency within them—a force like an explosion.

“Hurry and take it. The Break-Immortality Pills should be consumed immediately after being refined, otherwise their efficacy will drastically diminish!” Luotian’s voice echoed in Yu Haonan’s ears, pulling him from his awe.

“Right!” Yu Haonan nodded eagerly, without hesitation, placing the gleaming pills into his mouth.

“Roar…” A guttural cry echoed from Yu Haonan’s body, the dense immortal energy causing him to let out a blissful groan before he sat cross-legged on the ground, beginning to refine it.

The others also placed their pills into their mouths, starting to refine them slowly.

As Yu Haonan and the others refined the pills, more people were drawn by the wood and plant energy, their eyes turning toward Yu Haonan’s group.

“Isn’t that the person who broke Yu Haonan’s leg yesterday? He’s back again—seems he truly refined the pills!” The crowd murmured, their eyes turning to Luotian, now changed.

“Let’s see—those wood and plant energies were quite strong!” Soon, the crowd grew curious, waiting for the results of Yu Haonan’s group consuming Luotian’s pills.

Time passed slowly, an hour slipping by unnoticed. Yet Yu Haonan and his companions showed no changes.

“Was it all for nothing? The commotion was so big, but it seems like a scam!” After an hour, the crowd grew impatient. Some had already left.

“They’re definitely fake! I was right all along—what a fool, performing the refinement in front of us!” Those who had previously thought Yu Haonan’s group were fake now confirmed their suspicions.

“About time!” Luotian smiled all the while, then adjusted his white banner before gazing at Yu Haonan’s group.

“Crack…” As Luotian's words fell, a crisp sound echoed from Yu Haonan’s body. Suddenly, the world shifted, and a powerful suction emanated from his form.

“Buzz…” Immortal energy surged, filling the market’s sky with thick immortal mist that enveloped everyone.

“Open…” As the mist formed, Yu Haonan opened his eyes, excitement flashing within them. His robes fluttered violently as an intense pain surged through him—yet it did not dampen his excitement.

“Ah…” Yu Haonan inhaled deeply, and the mist above everyone’s heads rushed toward him.

At the same time, several other Heavenly Dao-level masters stood up, their eyes alight with excitement. They opened their mouths to devour the澎湃 immortal mist.

Porous whirlwinds formed above their heads, and Yu Haonan’s group devoured the thick immortal mist like ravenous beasts. Their auras surged rapidly.

“By heaven!” Everyone was stunned, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at the sky.

“This is an ascension!” People were not foolish; they knew what this meant.

“Boom… boom… boom…” As the crowd marveled, a series of thunderous roars echoed in their ears. The immortal mist above was completely devoured by Yu Haonan’s group, and thunderous sounds echoed from their bodies.

An invisible pressure rose from Yu Haonan’s form. Standing there, he radiated the aura of a Heavenly Immortal in the middle stage. He clenched his fists, waves rippling from his hands.

“Heavenly Immortal in the middle stage! I’ve finally reached it!” Yu Haonan roared, then gazed at Luotian with gratitude in his eyes.

“Heavenly Immortal!” The others also rejoiced, gazing at Luotian. Without his pills, they would never have ascended so quickly—perhaps even stagnating in the Heavenly Dao stage for years.

“Truly effective!” Everyone was awestruck, staring at Luotian. They had never expected his pills to be so genuine.

Everyone knew Yu Haonan; within the outer sect, he was well-known. His ascension was the best proof.

Yu Haonan strode toward Luotian, causing a stir. They all clearly remembered how this alchemist had broken Yu Haonan’s legs yesterday.

“Ascended to the middle stage of Heavenly Immortal—does he seek revenge?” Everyone speculated in their minds. Those who knew Yu Haonan’s vengeful nature guessed he would retaliate.

“Master, do you still refine pills?” But Yu Haonan’s question stunned them all.

They had no idea that, in Yu Haonan’s heart, Luotian was undoubtedly a master from the Pill Peak. He could sense that Luotian’s pills were different from any he had consumed before.

“Of course, no deception!” Luotian smiled. He knew what was coming next.

“This is all my spiritual herbs; you may refine as many as possible. Just give me the results!” Yu Haonan waved his hand, presenting a storage ring respectfully to Luotian.

“Master, mine too!” Other disciples also handed over their rings, eyes filled with reverence. They feared being last and knew that from today on, this master’s pills might be hard to obtain.

“Master, I wish to refine a Divine Yang Pill. Here are the herbs!” Others’ eyes lit up, surrounding Luotian. Though his prices were higher, alchemists were rare.

“Line up!” Luotian smiled, gazing at the crowd rushing toward him. He began to collect storage bags frenziedly.

Yu Haonan and the others also arranged for Luotian, now a Heavenly Immortal in the middle stage. After passing the inner sect’s exam, he was an inner sect disciple—no one dared to provoke him.

This time, Luotian stayed until dusk before returning, collecting all the herbs and required pills from those needing refinement.

“Next time, wait fifteen days. Come back here to collect the pills!” Luotian addressed the crowd.

“Master, though we believe in you, could you kindly leave your name? We’re a bit uneasy. Though within the Heavenly Dragon Sect, we still lack confidence,” people asked Luotian.

“Pill-Luo!” Luotian spoke softly, then walked out of the crowd with his hands behind his back. He secretly calculated that these herbs might allow him to reach a third-grade immortal alchemist.

As Luotian walked a short distance, he noticed several figures silently following him. His expression turned cold, then suddenly turned around and waved his hand, sending several glimmers.

“Boom… boom…” Muffled sounds echoed as figures appeared in the crowd’s view.

“I won’t accept your pills. If anyone follows me again, they’ll get the same result!” Luotian coldly declared, leaving the crowd in shock.

“You bastards! If you anger the master to leave the outer sect, we’ll kill you!” Yu Haonan strode forward, grabbing one of those caught by Luotian and snarling.

“Yes! You sons of bitches!” Others also surrounded the group.

Luotian ignored them, circled for an hour, and returned to his thatched hut, entering a closed cultivation mode.

By day, he frenziedly refined pills; by night, he practiced the Ghost-Controlling Seal and absorbed ghost energy to enhance his cultivation. Sun Kernen was also elevated to the early stage of Heavenly Immortal through Luotian’s pills.

During Luotian’s cultivation, a rumor about him spread again within the Heavenly Dragon Sect.

Chapter 1824: Renowned in Heaven and Dragon

The Heavenly Dragon City Lord, Zuo Qiuming, returned to the Heavenly Dragon Sect, taking over the once lifeless He Peak and becoming one of the eight elders.

Yu Haonan, the three-time champion of the outer sect’s exams, was discovered to have an exceptional immortal soul during the spiritual soul test. His record surpassed Xuan Dan’s, but he rejected Xuan Dan’s request to be his disciple. Instead, he was sent to the outer sect as an ordinary disciple. Later, he clashed with inner sect prodigy Zhu Fengtian, nearly dying at his hands. Zuo Qiuming intervened and severely beat Zhu Fengtian.

“Luo Tian is my brother!” Zuo Qiuming publicly acknowledged, declaring Luo Tian his sworn brother. This title sparked further discussion about Luo Tian.

With Zuo Qiuming’s return, his identity spread—disciple of the eight supreme elders Long Dao and son-in-law of Elder Xue Changshan. This terrifying background made everyone respect him. Though Long Dao was missing, Xue Changshan still held the Earth Peak.

Though Luo Tian no longer had Xuan Dan’s favor, he now had Zuo Qiuming as a sworn brother. People marveled at his luck—first favored by Xuan Dan, then having Zuo Qiuming as a sworn brother. Within the Heavenly Dragon Sect, few could challenge Luo Tian. Zuo Qiuming’s beating of Zhu Fengtian proved their relationship was no coincidence.

This rumor shook the Heavenly Dragon Sect. People had thought Luo Tian had faded, but he suddenly created such a commotion.

Hearing this rumor, the most uneasy was the outer sect’s chief administrator Zhu Yude. These days, he had been trembling in fear. Though the person who ordered him to assign Luo Tian to the Heavenly Dragon Tomb was a big figure, he also couldn’t afford to offend Zuo Qiuming.

“What should I do? What should I do?” Zhu Yude sweated, pacing in his room with his hands behind his back.

“No matter what, I can’t offend that big figure. Though Zuo Qiuming is strong, it was this big figure’s order!” Zhu Yude then displayed a determined expression.

“Still, I should show some concern symbolically! Otherwise Zuo Qiuming might suspect me!” Zhu Yude muttered, then walked toward the Heavenly Dragon Tomb.

When Zhu Yude arrived at the tomb, the sky was fully bright. The ghostly creatures had just retreated, and the Ghost-Controlling Seal returned to Luo Tian’s mind.

“Nothing at all!” Zhu Yude frowned slightly, opening the door of Luo Tian’s courtyard and heading toward the thatched hut.

“Did I come at a bad time?” Zhu Yude felt surprised. Though the ghostly creatures had left, he still sensed a cold chill.

He pushed open the thatched hut’s door. A surge of ghostly energy rushed toward Zhu Yude, changing his expression.

“Such dense ghostly energy! Did he go out earlier?” Zhu Yude was puzzled. However, when he saw Luo Tian and two others sitting with yellow talismans on their foreheads, his face lit up.

“疯了, this is your own madness! But you brought others to join!” Zhu Yude sneered inwardly, then asked: “Little Brother Luo, what’s wrong with you?”

But Luo Tian and the others seemed not to hear Zhu Yude. They sat motionless, with black ghostly energy swirling around them.

“Mad! This is your own madness. Don’t blame me!” Zhu Yude felt delighted seeing Luo Tian ignore him. He tried calling Luo Tian’s name again, but still no response. He then walked out with a swaying gait, sighing inwardly that after a few days, this kid would die and he could report to the big figure.

Only when Zhu Yude was far away did the yellow talismans on Luo Tian’s group finally dispel the black ghostly energy.

“About time!” Luo Tian, Sun Kernen, and Yu Changtian opened their eyes simultaneously, exchanging glances.

“Last night’s test showed that immortal creatures in the middle stage couldn’t detect us. In a few days, even those in the late stage won’t detect us!” Sun Kernen’s eyes gleamed with excitement.

“The Ghost-Controlling Seal has advanced to the middle grade, capable of subduing immortal creatures in the early and middle stages!” Luo Tian’s face also showed joy. Their progress had been astonishingly fast, surpassing what they could achieve elsewhere.

“I’ll go deliver the pills first. Then I’ll take more orders. If nothing goes wrong, I should be able to refine third-grade immortal pills next time. Let’s aim for all of us reaching the middle stage of Heavenly Immortal within a month!” Luo Tian stood up slowly, gazing at Zhu Yude’s distant figure with coldness.

“Will I crush Zhu Fenghuo when I reach the middle stage of Heavenly Immortal?” Luo Tian muttered, recalling the humiliation Zhu Fenghuo had caused him.

“Compared to the native residents of this immortal realm, our cultivation speed is at least one level ahead!” Sun Kernen’s eyes held arrogance. Though their current strength was modest, they were confident that with enough time, they could reach the peak of this immortal realm.

“Yes! If I have time, there will be a place for us here!” Yu Changtian’s face also showed arrogance.

“You two keep it up! When the pill competition ends, I’ll become Xuan Dan’s disciple. Then see if he can let you stay. If not, we’ll have to resort to force and find a safe way to take you two!” Luo Tian addressed Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian, then stood up, putting on the thousand-illusion mask again. He returned to the market.

Luo Tian’s appearance once more caused a stir, people’s faces filled with respect and excitement as they gazed at him.

“Master Pill, you’ve finally come! We waited for you until the flowers withered!” The crowd surrounded him, greeting him enthusiastically.

“Master Pill, I thought I’d never see you again!” Yu Haonan’s voice rang out in the crowd. He strode forward, standing before Luo Tian.

“Master Pill, now you should call him Master Yu. He passed the inner sect’s exam three days ago and is now an inner sect disciple!” Everyone’s eyes showed envy, gazing at Yu Haonan. Their greatest wish was to become inner sect disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Sect.

“Congratulations!” Luo Tian nodded. Yu Haonan was brash, but he was decent.

“If it weren’t for Master Pill, I wouldn’t have entered the inner sect so quickly. Master Pill, if you need anything, I Yu Haonan will do my best to help!” Yu Haonan shouted.

“Alright, everyone take your pills!” Luo Tian smiled and waved his hand. A series of jade bottles flew from his hands, covering the ground. Though sealed, their intense wood and plant energy was still palpable.

“Thank you, Master Pill!” Everyone was excited, lining up to take their pills. They had learned from the previous tracking incident that Luo Tian was strict about rules—complying with them meant no problems.

After two hours, everyone received their pills. Luo Tian waited until they were done and spoke again: “Everyone, if you need more pills refined, now is the time. This time I can accept third-grade immortal pills!”

“Third-grade!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, everyone’s breath quickened. Third-grade immortal pills were difficult to refine. Third-grade alchemists were rare in the inner sect; obtaining them required pleading and begging, and even then, success was uncertain.

“Alright,” people eagerly formed a line again, thinking about what pills they wanted to refine.

Time passed until dusk. Luo Tian’s life returned to calmness—refining pills by day, practicing ghost control and absorbing ghost energy at night.

However, during this time, outer sect disciples experienced a surge of breakthroughs into the middle stage of Heavenly Immortal. This shocked the inner sect disciples, who all said that it was due to Master Pill Luo Tian’s pills. This spread the name of “Pill-Luo” within the inner sect, though people didn’t take it seriously.

“This is a good business!” Soon, some inner sect disciples of the Pill Peak noticed this outer sect market. They saw it as a way to obtain spiritual herbs, and many alchemists left the Pill Peak to come to the outer sect, hoping to refine pills for outer sect disciples like Luo Tian.

At first, Luo Tian was affected. After all, inner sect disciples were renowned, and he was only recently famous. For a while, those seeking to refine pills with Luo Tian dropped sharply—described as “a door that could be counted.” Even those who had previously asked Luo Tian to refine pills with Yu Haonan switched to others.

In the market, Luo Tian smiled as he sat there. A few people had angry expressions.

“Those people are really shameless!” A young man shouted, his eyes gleaming with greed. He was Sun Kernen in disguise. Though his appearance changed, his greedy eyes remained unchanged.

Chapter 1825: Inner Sect of the Pill Peak

“Exactly! Those people were always high and mighty in the inner sect. We had to beg for them to refine pills. Master Pill refined our pills, and now they’re coming to steal his business!” Others also became angry. These days, Luo Tian’s third-grade pills had greatly improved the outer sect.

“Don’t worry. Within three days, they’ll all come back,” Luo Tian smiled slightly, sipping tea from a cup.

“Raise the price!” Putting down the cup, Luo Tian spoke softly. It almost made those people fall over.

“Sir, you’re about to lose business! If it weren’t for us, you’d have no customers at all. You still want to raise the price!” They thought internally, gazing at Luo Tian, wondering what he was thinking.

“Of course, you guys won’t be raised. You’ll even lower it!” Luo Tian looked at them. They were all loyal, so he would give them rewards.

“Let those inner sect disciples have some time. After all, I’ve taken quite a few of their business!” He waved his white banner and wrote: third-grade pills, eight spiritual herbs, no negotiation.

“Eight herbs…” Besides Sun Kernen, everyone was speechless. Even those inner sect disciples who came out didn’t dare to ask for eight herbs.

“Don’t worry, don’t worry. The opportunity to get rich has arrived. I’ve always thought you should raise the price!” Sun Kernen laughed, comforting them.

“Tell me what pills you want to refine. Three herbs will do!” Luo Tian addressed the remaining people, causing their eyes to gleam with excitement.

“Hmph, really heartless. Even now, you still raise the price!” As Luo Tian and others spoke, someone passing by saw the words on Luo Tian’s banner and scoffed.

These people were those who had previously tried to track Luo Tian but were caught by him and refused their pills. Now that inner sect disciples had come out, they naturally found a place to refine pills.

“It’s not like it was before!” Hearing their words, Luo Tian’s people became angry.

“Haha, it was then, but now I really don’t need him!” A young man spoke, his voice filled with contempt.

“If you were me, you’d lower the price. Maybe I would consider refining pills here. Otherwise, your business is over from today!” The young man saw Luo Tian’s place was quiet and felt unusually good, constantly speaking.

“Hmph, I hope you win in the end!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly and didn’t take their words seriously.

“Ugh, thinking you’re some master…” They kept mocking before leaving the market.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian and those people stayed for a day without anyone coming to refine pills. Some came hoping Luo Tian would lower the price, but they were all rejected, naturally drawing more mockery.

“Let’s go. You’ve worked hard today!” Luo Tian smiled and gave them a few pills before leaving with Sun Kernen.

For the next three days, Luo Tian did not appear again. The outer sect people seemed to forget Luo Tian’s existence. As time passed, the inner sect disciples of the Pill Peak sent out their pills to outer sect disciples.

In a simple courtyard, a large man took out his pill. This was the Break-Immortality Pill he had asked an inner sect third-grade immortal alchemist disciple to refine.

“I feel it’s different from the one Yu Haonan took!” The man’s eyes showed contemplation. Still, he hesitated and placed the emerald-green pill into his mouth, beginning to refine it.

Time passed slowly. The man suddenly opened his eyes, disappointment in them: “My cultivation level is similar to Yu Haonan’s. Even better than him. Why did he reach the middle stage of Heavenly Immortal while I, though feeling my cultivation improved, didn’t break through!”

“It’s the pill. The efficacy is insufficient!” Next moment, his eyes gleamed with intensity, guessing where the problem lay.

“Exactly!” The man waved his hand again. Two golden pills appeared in his hands—one was the one he had asked Luo Tian to refine, and the other was from that inner sect disciple.

“Too different! Just by appearance, it’s much worse!” The man muttered, then swallowed both pills. Opening his eyes, he felt the difference between the two.

“Three times worse!” The man flew into action, rushing out of his courtyard toward the market. His regret was immense.

At the same time, others gradually discovered the problem. Their pills refined by inner sect disciples were much worse than those from Luo Tian. Same herbs, three times the difference—choosing which was obvious.

“Damn… where is Master Pill?” However, as people increased, they noticed a problem: Luo Tian had disappeared.

“Done! Master Pill must have driven us away!” They thought of their previous treatment toward Luo Tian.

“It’s because you forgot why those inner sect disciples came out. If it weren’t for Master Pill stealing their business, you’d still be begging them to refine pills!” Those who had supported Luo Tian looked down with mockery. These days, they were憋了 enough. Now seeing people rushing to find Luo Tian made them feel secretly pleased and amazed at Luo Tian’s accurate prediction.

“Come on, who wants to refine pills today?” As people discussed, several figures with arrogance entered the market, shouting at everyone.

“This…” People hesitated, gazing at those arrogant figures. But eventually, they bit their teeth. After all, Luo Tian’s return was uncertain. If they offended these people, what would happen to their pills?

“Master Pill!” However, as people prepared to ask those several people to refine pills, Luo Tian and Sun Kernen walked in with their white banners leisurely. Their eyes held smiles.

“Master Pill!” Everyone’s faces showed excitement, instantly surrounding Luo Tian again.

“Master Pill, we were rude before. Please don’t take it personally!” People all spoke, expressing their apologies.

“Same old rules!” Luo Tian didn’t take it seriously. After all, he needed herbs and a lot of pill formulas to enhance his alchemy skills.

“But Master Pill, your price increase is too much!” Then people saw the words on the white banner and smiled bitterly.

“Next one…” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, no intention to lower the price. These were all their own faults.

“Ugh…” Everyone sighed deeply, regretting they had done this. If they had continued to refine pills with Luo Tian, it wouldn’t have been this situation.

“Raise the price!” Then everyone bit their teeth. Even with the increase, it was still cheaper here.

“Those who can’t gather enough herbs can exchange them with spirit stones!” Luo Tian addressed the crowd. People spoke up, and they managed to gather eight herbs—though it was difficult. As for the exchange ratio, with Sun Kernen’s greed, they wouldn’t lose out.

“Speechless…” Those ten or so inner sect disciples were speechless. They hadn’t expected that when this Pill-Luo returned, their business suddenly vanished. It wasn’t like that before.

“That Pill-Luo—have I seen him? He’s definitely not from our Pill Peak!” The ten or so disciples looked grim. Who were they? A superlative presence within the Heavenly Dragon Sect. They hadn’t expected an outer sect disciple to steal their business. As Luo Tian had said, if it weren’t for this Pill-Luo, they wouldn’t have come out to compete with him. They would have been comfortably waiting for others to beg them to refine pills.

“We’ll see what you’ve got!” The ten or so disciples glared, exchanged looks, then strode toward Luo Tian.

“Pill-Luo! Come out!” The leading disciple shouted, but the noise was too chaotic to hear their shouts.

“Get lost!” However, these disciples weren’t pushovers. They pushed and shoved, and the outer sect disciples dared not offend them, making way for these people to approach Luo Tian.

“Everyone, if you want to refine pills, line up. If you’re here for trouble, consider the consequences!” Sun Kernen smiled and addressed them.

“Fat pig! Get out of my way. I’m looking for that kid!” The leading disciple swung his hand, aiming to hit Sun Kernen.

“Buzz…” Though the disciple was fast, Sun Kernen was faster. He had been holding a grudge and waved his hand, summoning the spade he often used for tomb raiding. He swung it at the disciple.

“Smack…” The sound echoed, and the spade struck the disciple’s face. His body flew backward.

“Damn it! I’ve been bullied by these bastards all day. Think I’m a soft target, do you?” Sun Kernen carried the spade on his shoulder, looking at them with contempt.

“Damn it! Where did this brute come from to dare hit inner sect disciples!” Everyone’s faces showed shock, gazing at Sun Kernen. They hadn’t expected him to be even more fierce than Luo Tian.

Chapter 1826: The Unparalleled Break-Immortality Pills

“Outer sect beating inner sect! I’ve never seen this before!” Everyone was stunned, gazing at Sun Kernen standing there. Even the inner sect disciples of the Pill Peak showed shock, not expecting this fat man to dare hit them.

“Rebellion!” They soon became angry. Who were they? Inner sect disciples of the Pill Peak. Though other peaks’ disciples would be polite to them, now they had been beaten by an outer sect disciple. If this spread, where would their face be?

“Let’s all attack and teach them a lesson!” The ten or so disciples shouted, surrounding Luo Tian and Sun Kernen.

“What? Are you all going to fight together?” Sun Kernen waved his spade, gazing at them defiantly.

“Master! Someone is bullying me!” Sun Kernen then turned, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Damn it! He’s a coward!” Everyone was taken aback. Just now, he seemed fearless and invincible, but now he turned to someone else for help.

“Don’t run! You two won’t escape today!” The ten or so disciples shouted, surrounding Luo Tian and Sun Kernen.

“Guess with these people’s herbs, I should be able to advance to a fourth-grade alchemist!” Luo Tian muttered, then stood up slowly and charged toward the ten or so disciples.

Sun Kernen followed behind Luo Tian. Facing these ten people, they showed no fear.

Though the Pill Peak inner sect disciples had the same cultivation level as Heavenly Immortal, their combat power was far inferior to Luo Tian and Sun Kernen. Moreover, they weren’t chosen for their combat power but for other reasons. Thus, their combat power was even weaker than ordinary Heavenly Immortals. The flying-up disciples were invincible at their level, and this was fully demonstrated by Luo Tian and Sun Kernen.

Luo Tian continuously punched, while Sun Kernen swung his spade with great force. Soon, several Pill Peak disciples cried out and fell to the ground.

Within a quarter of an hour, over ten people lay on the ground, bruised and groaning.

“Two monsters…” People’s mouths twitched as they watched Luo Tian and Sun Kernen effortlessly defeat them.

“Because I stole some of your meals, I’ll let you off this time. If there’s a next time, it won’t be so simple!” Luo Tian glared at the disciples, scanning them.

Those scanned felt a shiver, as if they had been stared down by death.

“Yes! Yes! Master Pill, we were reckless!” The ten or so disciples quickly apologized.

“Alright, stop the nonsense. Let’s talk about compensation!” Sun Kernen interrupted their words, gazing at them.

“We wouldn’t dare to ask for compensation. We can heal these injuries ourselves!” Hearing Sun Kernen’s words, the ten or so disciples spoke in unison. They were truly afraid—these two were monsters. Without the cultivation level of Heavenly Immortal in the middle stage, they couldn’t handle these two.

“Then thank you. Since you don’t want compensation, but I was also injured, you must compensate me!” Sun Kernen gazed at them, his eyes gleaming with intensity. He wouldn’t miss this chance to make money.

“Spit…” Hearing Sun Kernen’s words, the ten or so Pill Peak disciples spat blood, cursing him for being shameless.

“Damn it! You were the ones beating us two. We didn’t even touch you, especially you, Master Pill used his fists. You just hit with a spade. How could you be injured…” The ten or so disciples cursed inwardly, and even the surrounding people felt they couldn’t watch anymore. They secretly sighed at how shameless Master Pill’s companion was.

“What? You don’t want to compensate?” Sun Kernen lightly tapped his spade, his eyes filled with threats.

“Compensate… we’ll compensate…” The ten or so disciples, seeing Sun Kernen’s spade, turned pale. They handed their storage rings to Sun Kernen.

“Your necklace is nice… what’s your bracelet made of?” Sun Kernen grabbed their storage rings, searched through them, almost stripping them completely. He found nothing valuable and waved his hand generously.

“Truly, not a single hair left!” People watching Sun Kernen’s actions had twitching mouths.

“Yes… yes…” The ten or so disciples wanted to say some harsh words but finally held back, fleeing in panic from the crowd.

“Beating and extorting inner sect disciples. What’s Master Pill’s background? He must be more than just an outer sect disciple!” People showed reverence, gazing at Luo Tian.

“After this deal, we’ll stop,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly and reorganized himself.

By dusk, Luo Tian and Sun Kernen returned to their residence. The story of Luo Tian and Sun Kernen beating the Pill Peak inner sect disciples spread throughout both the inner and outer sects.

“First, Luo Tian clashed with Zhu Fengtian. Now another Luo Tian—beating inner sect disciples, defying authority. Are these outer sect disciples so bold?” The Pill Peak inner sect disciples were furious, shouting.

“Let’s go to the outer sect. Let’s see who dares to be so bold!” The entire Pill Peak erupted, their faces filled with anger. They rushed out of the Pill Peak and into the outer sect.
