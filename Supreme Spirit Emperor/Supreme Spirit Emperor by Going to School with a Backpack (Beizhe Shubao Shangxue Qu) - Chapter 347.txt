“Ah…” A heart-wrenching scream echoed through the starry sky, as the void warship glided forward slowly, crushing countless continents that had yet to evacuate. Blood dyed the starry sky of the Mortal Domain.

The massive void warship turned blood-red, as if emerging from hell itself, a vessel of life-reaping. Luo Tian's eyes were cold as he watched each continent being crushed by the void warship, his gaze fixed on the increasingly ominous Mortal King's Palace.

“Die!” A furious roar echoed from within the Mortal King's Palace, as the grand palace slowly moved forward, charging toward the void warship.

“Boom…!” Two titanic forces approached each other, radiating overwhelming aura as if determined to settle their fate.

“Epoch Treasure! That Mortal King's Palace is an Epoch Treasure!” Xuan Bing, the old ancestor, spoke with a solemn gaze as he observed the sinister palace.

“If they collide, we will suffer heavy losses!” Several old ancestors sighed, their eyes turning to Luo Tian.

“One is not enough; let us use two!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a black yin fish emerged from his palm, radiating dark light that enveloped the entire void warship.

“Senior Sun!” Luo Tian turned to face Sun Kemin, a faint smile in his eyes.

“Hmph.” Sun Kemin understood the situation, and with a flick of his hand, a white yang fish emerged from his palm, rushing toward the yin fish.

“Haha… Xiaohei, it's been years!” As the yang fish appeared, a loud laugh echoed through the starry sky.

“You call me Xiaohei again, and I’ll kill you, Bai Paozi!” The yin fish’s artifact spirit leaped out from within the yin fish, addressing the white-glowing yang fish spirit.

“Come on, mortals, tremble! If we unite, we are invincible!” The two artifact spirits, with haughty expressions, addressed Luo Tian and his companions.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian and Sun Kemin both spoke at once, gazing at the two unreliable artifact spirits hovering above them.

“Mortals, set aside your reverent looks. With us two around, no Feng clan will escape unscathed! You can rest easy!” The two artifact spirits failed to realize they were nearing the Mortal King's Palace, continuing their boasts.

“Quickly recite the incantation!” The two artifact spirits urged Luo Tian and Sun Kemin, causing their faces to pale. They had never known that activating these creatures required an incantation.

Yet, as the two spirits’ voices echoed in their minds, their lips began to twitch.

Chapter 1401: Yin-Yang Invincible

“Hurry, the more people recite it, the greater its power! Hurry!” The two spectral forms of the yin and yang fish looked expectantly at Luo Tian and Sun Kemin standing on the void warship.

“This…” Luo Tian and Sun Kemin exchanged glances, their eyes filled with a bitter smile before they spoke slowly.

“Believe in the Yin-Yang Patriarch for eternal life…” They had barely begun when they could not continue; it was too shameless.

“Hmm…” Upon hearing Luo Tian and Sun Kemin’s feeble voices, the two artifact spirits felt a surge of energy.

“Continue! Continue! It’s been years since I’ve heard such a chant. It brings back memories of when we followed the Divine and Demon Lords, witnessing countless people chanting in unison!” The yin-yang fish spirits spoke with a nostalgic tone.

“Hurry, let them all chant! If they don’t, we’ll go on strike!” The plump yang fish spirit wore a threatening expression as it addressed Sun Kemin.

“Indeed, everyone must chant together… if not, we’ll strike!” The yin fish looked at the yang fish with an expression of ‘you’re so smart.’

“Your mother!” Luo Tian and Sun Kemin muttered under their breath, cursing the two bastards for choosing to strike at such a critical moment.

“Hurry up, or we’ll crash!” The yin and yang fish spirits spoke as they neared the Mortal King's Palace.

“Let everyone chant together!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and relayed the incantation stored in the yin fish to Xuan Bing and others.

“This…”

“It’s too shameless!” Xuan Bing and the others twitched their lips but had no choice; to minimize damage to the Seven Star Island, they relayed the incantation to all its people.

“What in the world is this incantation!” The entire Seven Star Island erupted into chaos, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at the two living treasures above.

“Chant!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, feeling a surge of unease. He could only shout loudly.

“Alright! Chant it, damn it!” Xuan Bing and the others gritted their teeth, unable to help but shout loudly.

“Believe in the Yin-Yang Patriarch for eternal life… The Yin-Yang Immortal… boundless power… unity of yin and yang… invincible!” A deep roar echoed from the void warship, as even Luo Tian and Xuan Bing shouted in unison. The Seven Star Island’s disciples and elders could only chant along.

A thunderous roar, millions chanting in unison, shook the heavens and earth beneath the gray starry sky of the Mortal Domain.

“Damn…” A loud voice startled the Feng clan’s warriors within the Mortal King's Palace, who then sneered.

“Are they trying to bolster their courage?” The Feng clan warriors mocked, confident in the Mortal King's Palace’s power as it was a true Epoch Treasure.

Though the void warship seemed formidable, it was ultimately not crafted by an Epoch Master, showing some disparity.

“Believe in the Yin-Yang Patriarch for eternal life…” The deep roar rose wave after wave, drawing mockery from the Feng clan.

“Haha…” Yet, in an instant, two loud laughs echoed through the starry sky. The yin and yang fish spirits, hearing Luo Tian’s group chanting, radiated a surge of light as if blessed, and they plunged into the yin and yang fish.

“Buzz…” The black and white fish leaped upon the void warship, and under Luo Tian’s group’s reluctant gaze, they slowly merged into a Taijitu pattern.

In the next moment, overwhelming waves of energy surged forth. A black and white pair of Epoch lights rose within the Taijitu pattern, radiating an epochal aura that enveloped the void warship.

“This…” The Feng clan’s faces changed abruptly as they witnessed the black and white Dao seals, radiating power rivaling even the Mortal King's Palace. Their eyes filled with horror.

“Crack…” As the Feng clan warriors were horrified, a resounding sound echoed through the starry sky.

The void warship, enveloped by the yin-yang fish, collided with the sinister Mortal King's Palace. The entire starry sky trembled as the collision shattered, releasing vast waves of gray mist that swept over the void warship and the Mortal King's Palace.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian’s group felt their heads throb, their faces pale for a moment, eyes filled with fear as they swayed at the bow of the void warship.

“Puke…” Some disciples and elders from the Seven Star Island could not withstand this ultimate collision, spitting blood as they fell to the ground in weakness.

This was only possible due to the yin fish spirit and the void warship’s cooperation. Otherwise, the Seven Star Island would have suffered heavy losses.

On the other side, the Feng clan and their direct descendants were not so fortunate. They had assumed victory due to their Epoch Treasure, but they could not have anticipated that after the Seven Star Island’s group chanted those strange incantations, such a transformation would occur—without any preparation.

The yin-yang fish void warship combined, its power surpassing even the Epoch Treasure. The Feng clan suffered a massive defeat.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Clots of blood rose within the Mortal King's Palace, as Feng clan disciples and direct descendants were continuously turned into blood mist.

“Damn it!” Ming Zhenyan and other Feng clan elders felt their qi surge, as the collision had even shaken Ming Zhenyan. How much more so for others? One single collision had already caused heavy losses to the Feng clan.

The sound echoed across the Nine Domains, causing its people to tremble with disbelief as they gazed toward the Mortal Domain.

“Is it the direction of the Mortal Domain? Luo Tian’s group has begun!” The people of the Nine Domains murmured, eyes filled with fear.

“This is an ultimate collision—resulting from both Epoch Treasures being fully activated!” People felt a surge of fear, exclaiming in awe.

“Did you see? Did you see? This is the power of the Yin-Yang Immortal! Unity of yin and yang, invincible to all! Who else? Haha, shout louder, we’ll give it our best shot and annihilate these phoenix scum!” The yin-yang fish spirits separated, their expressions filled with pride as they appeared before the people. Their eyes looked down on the Feng clan within the Mortal King's Palace.

“Luo Tian!” Some Feng clan old ancestors saw Luo Tian standing on the void warship, their eyes turning red with fury as they shouted.

Ming Zhenyan also had cold glimmers in his eyes, his Epoch Apex cultivation radiating as he flew from the Mortal King's Palace with a grotesque expression.

“Ming Zhenyan, it’s really you!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness as he gazed at Ming Zhenyan, who radiated overwhelming power. He let out a cold snort.

“Impressed? I’ve reached Epoch Apex, and you came to me. So I’ll have no choice but to kill you!” Ming Zhenyan roared, if not for Luo Tian’s obstruction, the demon clan would have already appeared in the Nine Domains. At that time, how fragile the Nine Domains were! Once the demon clan arrived in the Nine Domains, they would have swiftly occupied it.

But everything was because of Luo Tian’s variable. The Nine Holy Beasts of the Mortal Domain were left with only himself surviving, and Ming Zhenyan’s hatred toward Luo Tian had reached its peak.

Similarly, the Feng clan also despised Luo Tian to the core. Back then, Luo Tian had slain countless great sects’ disciples, but the only one he killed was their Feng clan’s disciple. This left the Feng clan without successors. If not for their alliance with Ming Zhenyan, they would have likely weakened during Feng Jiutian’s generation.

“Haha… I’ve been waiting for this day! Luo Tian, today I’ll kill you!” A deep, raspy voice echoed from within the Mortal King's Palace as a youth emerged from among the Feng clan, his eyes filled with madness, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Feng Jiutian!”

“How is this possible? He was killed by Luo Tian, how could he have come back to life!” Zheng Xin and others looked with disbelief at the youth standing before them.

Feng Jiutian, a prodigy of the Feng clan, likely to become the next ruler of the Divine Domain, and the only one capable of challenging Long Jie for the domain’s rulership. He had been slain by Luo Tian, no one expected him to reappear, alive again.

“You didn’t die either, so how could I?” Feng Jiutian’s eyes flashed with madness as gray flames surrounded him. His gaze was fixed on Luo Tian.

Humiliation—over the years, Feng Jiutian had never stopped thinking of seeing Luo Tian and slaying him with his own hands. If not for a great opportunity, Feng Jiutian would have been dead.

“Haha… how do you look so angry? Are you seeking revenge?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with disdain as he gazed at Feng Jiutian’s madness, speaking softly.

“Yes! For so many years, I’ve suffered much. But if I can kill you, it’s all worth it. Now I’m not the Feng Jiutian who was at your mercy!” Feng Jiutian shouted, his voice filled with confidence.

“Still so arrogant. Since you’ve come back to life, cherish your life and don’t be so reckless—your own death is inevitable!” Zheng Xin couldn’t help but mock.

“Feng Jiutian, I advise you to cherish life and stay away from Luo Tian!” Xu Liyi also couldn’t help but sneer at Feng Jiutian.

“Haha!” Their words caused the Seven Star Island’s people to laugh heartily, gazing at Feng Jiutian with disdain. They had never seen anyone of their level who could overpower Luo Tian.

“I can kill you once, I can do it again. But this time, you won’t be as lucky. The Feng clan dared to conspire with the demon clan! Self-destruction!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with infinite killing intent as he rushed toward Feng Jiutian.

Chapter 1402: Killing You Again, What's the Difference?

As Luo Tian vanished, the Seven Star Island’s people rushed from the void warship toward the Mortal King's Palace.

“Kill!” Feng Jiutian’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he rushed toward Luo Tian, followed by the Feng clan’s elders. However, compared to the Seven Star Island’s group, the Feng clan’s people seemed listless, having suffered heavy injuries from the previous collision.

“Hmph, have you forgotten old man?” Ming Zhenyan’s eyes flashed with coldness as his overwhelming aura radiated.

The aura of Epoch Apex caused the battlefield to pause momentarily, but soon a cold breath clashed with Ming Zhenyan’s aura.

“Do you think only you are at Epoch Apex?” Xuan Bing, the old ancestor, wore a cold smile as his white figure surged into the sky, immediately appearing above the Seven Star Island’s group and shouting.

“What!” Ming Zhenyan and the Feng clan’s faces showed disbelief as they gazed at Xuan Bing, who had appeared in the sky. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have such a powerful figure among his group.

“Damn it!” The Feng clan’s old ancestors’ faces darkened. Their greatest reliance was Ming Zhenyan, an Epoch Apex powerhouse. Otherwise, the Feng clan’s strength would not have been a match for the Four Holy Star Domains.

But now, with the Seven Star Island having brought out an Epoch Apex Xuan Bing, it had caught the Feng clan off guard.

Yet, since the battle had begun, there was no turning back. Even if the Feng clan wanted to stop, the Seven Star Island’s people would not.

“Kill!” In an instant, the Seven Star Island’s group rushed toward the Feng clan with ferocity.

The Seven Star Island had survived for years in the Origin Domain, and their strength needed no explanation. Even a single Epoch Mid-level powerhouse was beyond what the Feng clan could match. Their overall strength would be enough to withstand any of the Nine Domains’圣地.

Crushing, as soon as both sides clashed, many fell dead. The Seven Star Island’s side completely crushed the Feng clan.

“Crack…” Thunder roared as Luo Tian collided with Feng Jiutian in an instant.

The collision sent both of them retreating, Luo Tian’s eyes filled with caution as he observed Feng Jiutian. He had not expected that after coming back to life, Feng Jiutian had grown significantly—his physical strength was no less than that of some divine bodies or royal clan prodigies.

As they retreated, Feng Jiutian’s face was filled with shock. His right arm had cracks everywhere; he knew how his body had been forged through years of using the Heavenfire and Demon Flame. He believed his body was refined to its peak, but Luo Tian’s physique seemed even more formidable.

“Again! Today I’ll kill you!” Feng Jiutian’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he rushed toward Luo Tian again, the gray demon flame entering his body to strengthen it.

“Kill me? You won’t have the chance. I’ll send you where you belong!” Luo Tian sneered, his Reincarnation Immortal Body emitting a buzzing sound. Two great techniques were added, and he launched another punch toward Feng Jiutian.

“Boom…!” A furious roar echoed as the two clashed repeatedly. Luo Tian was like an undefeated war god, constantly clashing with Feng Jiutian.

The battlefield was chaotic, people dying continuously. However, it was one-sided; the Feng clan’s casualties were several times that of the Seven Star Island. They could not last long.

Catastrophic, the moment they clashed, it was catastrophic—blood dyed vast stretches of the starry sky. Cracks in the void rose continuously, and waves of void turbulence swept away countless lives.

“Ah…” The Feng clan’s people felt despair, having no chance to fight back. Luo Tian’s group had far more Epoch Mid-level power than them, and each strike took the lives of many Feng clan elders.

“Damn it!” Feng Jiutian’s lips bled as he watched the Feng clan members falling, his eyes filled with a hint of anxiety.

But Feng Jiutian finally understood Luo Tian’s terror. In just a few moments, they had clashed over ten times, but his qi was shaken while Luo Tian remained unscathed and showed no signs of injury.

“Don’t believe it!” Feng Jiutian’s face flashed with madness as gray flames roared within his body, forming a sea of gray fire that rushed toward Luo Tian. The terrifying temperature burned through the void, and Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a smile.

“Comparing flames?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed disdain. He formed hand seals, and seven-colored imprints jumped out. Xiaqi appeared before Luo Tian, sniffing the air with a delighted expression.

“Finally can eat!” Xiaqi laughed lightly, clapping her hands joyfully.

“Buzz…” In the next moment, the fierce gray flames reached Xiaqi and Luo Tian. They transformed into docile children, shrinking instantly into a ball of gray fire that jumped around Xiaqi, emitting an eager aura.

“Come here!” Xiaqi extended her small hand toward Feng Jiutian’s direction, a look of impatience on her face.

The buzz echoed. Feng Jiutian’s face changed abruptly as his own flame, the essence of his life, flew out from his body toward Xiaqi. No matter how he called or suppressed it, the flame ignored him.

“Ah…” Xiaqi opened her mouth again and swallowed the gray demon flame into it, her eyes filled with satisfaction.

“Truly a progenitor of fire!” Luo Tian lightly sneered, watching Xiaqi swallow the terrifying heavenly flame. He felt admiration.

“Damn it!” Feng Jiutian’s face turned pale as he watched his heavenly flame being devoured by Xiaqi, fear filling his heart.

“Kill!” But Feng Jiutian soon wore a mad expression. His phoenix wings and golden iron spear appeared in his hand, rushing toward Luo Tian again.

“Jian Wu Ya!” The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword radiated waves of thunder, instantly colliding with Feng Jiutian’s phoenix wings and golden iron spear.

After a brief collision, they separated. Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly as he sheathed the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

“End it!” Luo Tian looked at the Seven Star Island’s people suffering some damage. He didn’t want to waste words and wanted to completely crush Feng Jiutian.

“Enter the abyss!”

“Ferocious God’s Wrath, Trampling Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian directly activated his strongest state and used his ultimate martial art, the Seven Steps of the Ferocious God.

A mountain-like foot descended with a thunderous crash. Feng Jiutian’s face changed in horror, sensing the terror of Luo Tian’s step.

“Feng Dance Nine Heavens!” A phoenix shadow rose behind Feng Jiutian, forming a gray demon phoenix that swept through the starry sky toward Luo Tian’s foot.

“Boom…” The collision of both martial arts created a deafening roar, shaking the battlefield.

“Again that move!” Zheng Xin and others who were slaughtering the Feng clan looked with smiles, watching Luo Tian.

“I feel like I’ve seen this before. The last time I saw大哥 use it, it was somewhat familiar!” Chen Zhanbiao’s tall figure stood out among the crowd. His eyes showed a hint of confusion before he mimicked Luo Tian, stepping toward the Feng clan.

“Boom…!” The barbaric aura instantly spread. A thick foot descended upon Chen Zhanbiao’s feet, instantly crushing many Feng clan elders.

“Zhanbiao! You!” Xu Liyi was the first to see it, his face filled with disbelief. He hadn’t expected Chen Zhanbiao to also know Luo Tian’s Seven Steps of the Ferocious God.

“Zhanbiao!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with light, then he transmitted the incantation of Seven Steps of the Ferocious God into Chen Zhanbiao’s mind. At the same time, Luo Tian spoke to him.

“Zhanbiao, watch closely! This is the second step!” Luo Tian shouted loudly. The second step descended again toward Feng Jiutian.

“Ming Shen Liu Yin咒!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened as he saw Luo Tian’s second step radiating overwhelming power. His eyes flashed with madness.

A gray demon phoenix rose again behind Feng Jiutian, its cry echoing. It formed an invisible wave that rushed toward Luo Tian’s second step.

“Zhanbiao, this is the third step!” Luo Tian ignored it and spoke to Chen Zhanbiao again. The third step thunderously descended.

“Ah…” Feng Jiutian roared, his eyes filled with frustration. Luo Tian was teaching others martial arts while fighting him—this clearly showed no respect for him.

“Puke…” Feng Jiutian spat blood, which merged into the gray demon phoenix. The invisible wave tore through vast stretches of the starry sky, rushing toward Luo Tian’s second and third steps.

Yet, the outcome remained unchanged. Both martial arts clashed in the starry sky, creating a furious wave that swept through it.

“Zhanbiao, this is the fourth step…” Luo Tian seemed to ignore it and spoke again to Chen Zhanbiao. The fourth step descended, then the fifth.

The fourth and fifth steps rose instantly beneath Luo Tian’s feet, still rushing toward Feng Jiutian.

“Die!” Feng Jiutian roared. Luo Tian’s disregard had completely enraged him, and his body exploded in size, transforming into his true form. The gray demon phoenix shadow and one remaining, the gray aura burst from the phoenix’s mouth, forming a terrifying divine power that rushed toward Luo Tian’s foot.

Stars were annihilated. The collision between the two completely stopped the entire battlefield. Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi activated the void warship, protecting the Seven Star Island’s people.

“Boom…” However, this time Feng Jiutian was not so lucky. Luo Tian’s fifth step directly shattered the realms, stepping onto Feng Jiutian’s massive body.

Chapter 1403: The Sixth Step of the Ferocious God

On the vast battlefield, a black foot shattered realms and crushed the invisible imprints that Feng Jiutian had spat out. It stepped onto Feng Jiutian’s massive body.

A heart-wrenching phoenix cry echoed from the gray phoenix. Feng Jiutian’s massive body fell, scattering blood.

“Impossible!” Feng Jiutian’s enormous eyes showed disbelief and madness.

Feng Jiutian refused to believe he had been defeated by Luo Tian. From the beginning, he was suppressed by Luo Tian. He had endured so much after coming back to life—only he knew the depth of his suffering. If not for hatred, Feng Jiutian might not have achieved this status.

“You’ve done well. You didn’t die from my fifth step!” Luo Tian’s face showed genuine admiration. Indeed, most prodigies would have died under the fifth step, but Feng Jiutian had only suffered heavy injuries.

“Zhanbiao, did you see?” Luo Tian turned to face Chen Zhanbiao, who had a thoughtful expression. His eyes showed a faint smile.

“Ferocious God’s step shatters stars! Ferocious God’s third step terrifies gods!” A deep roar echoed from Chen Zhanbiao, the barbaric aura reaching its peak. A massive shadow of the Barbarian God rose behind him.

“Learned it!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed shock, watching Chen Zhanbiao’s legs repeatedly descend. From the second step to the fifth, each descent took the lives of many Feng clan elders, leaving Luo Tian in disbelief.

Luo Tian knew how difficult it was to learn the Seven Steps of the Ferocious God. Even the first prodigy of the Barbarian Clan, Ban Hun, could not have learned it so quickly. Moreover, he couldn’t have taken so many steps.

Moreover, under Luo Tian’s observation, Chen Zhanbiao didn’t seem to be using the Seven Steps of the Ferocious God for the first time. He was not clumsy at all, and even more skilled than Luo Tian.

“Does Zhanbiao have a connection with the Barbarian Clan?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed contemplation, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao’s massive body as he whispered.

“Zhanbiao! Watch closely. This is the sixth step! It’s my limit now!” Luo Tian then shouted loudly.

“Boom…!” The shadow of the Barbarian God also appeared behind Luo Tian, its blood-red eyes scanning across the battlefield. It locked onto Feng Jiutian and descended with a mountain-like body.

“Ferocious God’s Sixth Step! Shake the Heavens!” A deep roar echoed from Luo Tian, and at the same time, both Luo Tian and his Barbarian God’s shadow took a step forward. The roaring sound was overwhelming.

A black foot, radiating overwhelming power, pierced through the stars and crushed Feng Jiutian’s massive body.

“Boom…” The deafening sound was like two continents colliding. Feng Jiutian’s massive body could not withstand the sixth step of the Ferocious God and collapsed, turning into a cloud of blood that scattered across the starry sky.

With Feng Jiutian’s death, the entire battlefield paused. The Feng clan people were almost desperate, watching Feng Jiutian turn into a cloud of blood.

Feng Jiutian was the prodigy of the Feng clan. He had been slain by Luo Tian before, and then through the methods of the Mortal Domain, he was revived. He had refined the Heavenfire and Demon Flame. It could be said that Feng Jiutian was currently the strongest of the Feng clan, even surpassing the elders.

But now, he had been completely suppressed by Luo Tian from start to finish. Finally, he was crushed by Luo Tian’s foot. This step had completely shattered the Feng clan's hope—the hope of victory.

“Sizzle…” Seven-colored flames flew from Luo Tian’s hands, forming a vast sea of fire that instantly reduced Feng Jiutian’s flesh and bones to nothing.

“Ah… I’m not willing!” Feng Jiutian’s soul screamed in the seven-colored flames, but it could do nothing. It endured endless pain as the seven-colored flames gradually devoured it.

“Done!” The Feng clan people watched Feng Jiutian’s soul scream and disappear, feeling complete despair.

“Did he die this time?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a faint smile as he watched Feng Jiutian die again. His soul scanned the area, finding no remaining souls, and felt at ease.

“Did you see?” Luo Tian seemed to have done a trivial task as he looked at Chen Zhanbiao, more concerned about whether Chen Zhanbiao had learned the sixth step of the Seven Steps of the Ferocious God.

“Hmph, hmp.” Chen Zhanbiao nodded. Then he also took a step forward like Luo Tian, and the shadow of the Barbarian God appeared behind him. Unlike Luo Tian, this time the blood-red eyes looked at Chen Zhanbiao with a hint of gentleness.

But it was only for an instant, making Luo Tian rub his eyes, thinking he had seen a hallucination.

“Boom… boom… boom…” A gray foot shattered the stars, crushing countless Feng clan elders. Blood mist continuously scattered.

“Truly变态! Zhanbiao is also too变态! How could he learn this? Who says he’s stupid, I’ll beat him!” Xu Liyi’s eyes showed excitement as he shouted loudly.

“Then it's simple now,” Luo Tian said, looking at the Feng clan still desperately struggling. His eyes showed a faint smile as he gazed into the void, where Xuan Bing and Ming Zhenyan were locked in battle.

A series of waves that made Luo Tian’s heart race continuously echoed from the void, causing his brow to furrow slightly.

Ming Zhenyan and Xuan Bing were both newly promoted to Epoch Apex, so their strength was nearly equal. For now, it was difficult to determine the winner.

“Let’s finish off these Feng clan people first!” Luo Tian moved forward, rushing toward the Feng clan.

Massacre. The Feng clan and their direct descendants were completely slaughtered before the Seven Star Island’s group, especially with Xu Liyi’s addition.

Each time they struck, the Feng clan people died in droves. Luo Tian and his group were drenched in blood, like death gods emerging from hell, reaping the lives of the Feng clan people like harvesting wheat.

Although it was a massacre, the battle lasted three days and nights. Vast stretches of void were shattered, blood dyed the Mortal Domain.

However, soon after, Luo Tian suddenly noticed that no matter how many people died, none of them would bleed again. The blood river was unknowingly flowing into the sinister palace hovering above their heads.

After three days and nights of massacre, the Feng clan people were completely eliminated. Once the top of the Divine Domain’s Eight Holy Clans, they had rebelled against the Divine Domain and occupied the Mortal Domain, attempting to develop into another major clan. Now they had completely vanished.

“We’ve destroyed a holy clan!” Xu Liyi and others also felt amazed. Back then, the Feng clan of the Divine Domain was so high above them; now it had been completely destroyed. It was truly a touching feeling.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly, then his face showed a hint of seriousness as he gazed at the sinister Mortal King's Palace above.

“What’s going on!” As Luo Tian’s gaze turned, people also noticed something was wrong. Their eyes showed disbelief.

“Haha!” A loud laugh echoed through the void, and Ming Zhenyan, who was battling Xuan Bing, showed a hint of joy.

“A mere Feng clan! Destroying it is just destroying it. You wanted to use me? That’s a foolish dream. However, I should thank you for providing so much Feng clan blood to activate the seal within the Mortal King's Palace!” Ming Zhenyan laughed, watching the Mortal King’s Palace absorb the blood energy.

“Buzz…” Waves of gray mist continuously spewed from the Mortal King's Palace, as if countless souls were crying out in agony. A terrifying aura that made Luo Tian’s heart race spread from the Mortal King's Palace.

“Has my seal been opened?” A cold voice echoed within the Mortal King’s Palace, making Luo Tian and others more serious.

“Everyone return to the void warship!” Luo Tian shouted at the Seven Star Island people, not wanting them to suffer more casualties.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Seven Star Island people naturally listened. After three days of battle, they were exhausted. Their figures orderly returned to the void warship, leaving Luo Tian and a group of Epoch Mid-level warriors standing before it. Their eyes were cautious as they gazed at the sinister Mortal King's Palace.

“Who broke the seal?” A deep voice echoed from within the Mortal King’s Palace, then as if something was slowly awakening, a powerful vitality surged through it.

Gray mist spewed out. A young figure emerged from the Mortal King's Palace, his face carrying a faint smile. His body radiated an aura of superiority.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian felt a tightness in his heart. The youth’s aura was familiar, as if he had encountered it before.

“Solitary in the world!” The youth gazed at the starry sky of the Mortal Domain, his eyes filled with a hint of sorrow and nostalgia.

“Mortal King’s Son!” The terrifying thought arose in Luo Tian's mind. He finally recognized the reason for the youth’s aura being so familiar—it was the same feeling he had felt from Zhongli Tian and Miaoyin’s Master, Zangzixuan.

“After so many years, has the world changed?” The youth’s eyes showed nostalgia as he furrowed his brows, gazing at the gray void of the Mortal Domain.

“Where have the ancient royal clans gone? Why am I here?” The youth furrowed his brows and asked, gazing at Luo Tian.

“I felt the aura of the demon clan on you. You’ve killed the demon clan! And not just one!” The youth spoke coldly, as if Luo Tian was a worm in his eyes. In his time, humans were worms.

Chapter 1404: Mortal Illusion

“Epoch Late Period!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed as he gazed at the youth wrapped in gray mist. His gaze was filled with contempt, even facing Luo Tian and his group.

“Since when have humans become so strong? There are even Epoch Apex masters!” The youth gazed at the battle between Xuan Bing and Ming Zhenyan in the void, muttering to himself.

“Prince!” Ming Zhenyan took the opportunity to point at the youth, his eyes filled with excitement.

After a moment, the youth’s face showed understanding. He let out a long sigh: “My father once said humans would rise. But I hadn’t expected humans to develop this much, even subduing the ancient royal clans!”

“Let’s fight together and kill him!” Zheng Xin shouted, sensing an oppressive aura from the youth as he addressed Luo Tian’s group.
