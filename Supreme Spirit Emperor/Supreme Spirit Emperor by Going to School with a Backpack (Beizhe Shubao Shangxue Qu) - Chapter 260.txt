“Fifteen days! Luotian is truly a prodigy, enduring for fifteen days and still continuing!” Xu Liyi's eyes reflected awe. Even Diao Yuanshan displayed a look of shock, surprised that Luotian had endured so long.

The sensation they all experienced was one of countless deaths and rebirths, unbearable pain that threatened to consume them. It was possible they might lose themselves within the Feihua Immortal Pool.

“How much of the Heavenly Dao's suppression has been unraveled on his back?”

“Indeed, even now, the Heavenly Dao’s suppression remains difficult to resolve,” Diao Yuanshan said, his eyes flickering with anxiety. His gaze was tense; if he sensed even the slightest anomaly in Luotian, he would intervene immediately to stop him.

“Fei Hua and Ascend to Immortality!” After enduring so many days, Luotian finally completed his comprehension of the Feihua Immortal Scripture. He felt his body brimming with power, yet after over ten days of fragmentation and rebirth, he had grown numb.

After enduring the repeated shattering and reformation for over ten days, Luotian sensed that the Heavenly Dao’s suppression on his back had lessened by at least half. Though it still affected him, it was far stronger than before—now he possessed the qualifications to advance.

“Hum…” As Luotian completed his comprehension of the Feihua Immortal Scripture, he entered another strange realm. Suddenly, waves of energy radiated from the illusion.

“Human, we meet again!” A deep voice emerged from the black soul, causing Luotian’s heart to tighten.

“Who are you?” This was their first conversation. Previously, due to the brief time, Luotian hadn’t had a chance to speak before his body was pulled back into his form.

“Who I am is irrelevant, but here, you must have come for the Feihua Immortal Scripture. And it seems you’ve already mastered it!” The black figure’s eyes glimmered with a hint of amusement.

“Come, kill you, and I shall obtain the Feihua Immortal Scripture. I’m sure my strength will increase significantly in our world!” The black figure let out a light laugh, his gaze fixed on Luotian.

“What are you? Daring to wish to kill me!” At the moment the black soul appeared, Luotian knew they were enemies.

“Fight! In those days, your kind was weak. If not for a few exceptionally powerful individuals who sealed the entrance to your world, you would have already perished!” The black figure spoke softly, his tone laced with disdain, as if looking down upon an inferior race.

Luotian’s heart surged with waves of fury. The opponent clearly did not belong to the Nine Domains; it was an essential difference. Not human, nor a beast, but of the same life level as those monsters he had previously destroyed and absorbed. Yet this black soul seemed more advanced than the others.

Regardless, first fight, then decide. Perhaps he would become a formidable enemy of the Nine Domains in the future. Now that they had met, Luotian naturally wished to test his strength.

Determined, Luotian’s mind flashed with killing intent. His golden soul surged forward through the gray space resembling a passage, charging toward the black soul.

The golden soul radiated supreme authority, launching a fist toward the black soul. A mountain-moving aura surged from Luotian’s fist within the Feihua Immortal Pool, elevating his strength to another level. If he left now, Luotian was confident in reaching the late stage of Sagehood. With the Fivefold Attack and the Dao’s power, plus the Feihua Immortal Scripture that overcomes all, Luotian was certain he would be invincible at the late Sagehood stage.

The black soul, witnessing Luotian’s mountain-moving fist, displayed a flicker of surprise. He hadn’t expected Luotian to be so powerful—this made him feel he had underestimated humans.

“Interesting!” The black soul’s light flickered, and a dark fist凝聚ed, striking back with the same Dao power. It seemed more complete than Luotian’s, reaching the level where three thousand Dao paths converged into one.

The thunderous sound echoed repeatedly within the strange space, as if they had crossed two different eras and realms. Their battle commenced.

“Dao Suppression, Fanta Attack!” Luotian unleashed his power, the golden soul radiating intense energy. His golden fist, carrying a tremor of heaven and earth, struck toward the black soul.

What stunned Luotian most was that the opponent had already mastered three thousand Dao paths completely. The black fist also radiated a tremendous power, colliding with Luotian’s fist.

“Peng…” In an instant, both figures separated, two beams of light—golden and black—erupting from their eyes. They interwove together.

Subsequently, both of their eyes were filled with shock, each seeing the other’s solemnity.

Both were prodigies, their first encounter with such a formidable opponent. Luotian was stunned by the audacity of someone so extraordinary, seemingly not much older yet having mastered three thousand Dao paths.

The black soul was equally astonished by Luotian’s attack methods, fivefold power—even he had to be cautious.

“Are you a prodigy among humans?” The black soul’s eyes glimmered with amusement, addressing Luotian.

“Ha! Among humans, I am merely the weakest type. Do you think a prodigy would come to this desolate place seeking opportunity?” Luotian’s mind stirred, responding loudly.

As they spoke, they exchanged several rounds of blows, each marveling at the other’s strength.

“The weakest? Impossible! Humans were so weak back then!” The black soul’s voice carried disbelief, his dark eyes like a demon’s gaze fixed on Luotian.

“Bet right!” Luotian felt a surge of joy; this was precisely what he wanted—the black soul to believe humans were strong. Though he didn’t know the black soul’s background, Luotian knew it harbored intentions toward humans.

“Haha! Human development is beyond your comprehension!” Luotian’s hands moved swiftly, casting the Soul-Stealing Seal. At the same time, he launched three punches toward the black soul.

“Yet you, who are you? Why do you look down on us humans?” Luotian’s punches resonated with the Dao’s voice, and all three punches plus the Soul-Stealing Seal were deflected by the black soul.

“Hmph, you have some strength; you deserve to know my name. Listen well—I am the Prince of the Xieyue Blood Clan, Tu Yangfei!” The black soul’s face bore a hint of pride as he addressed Luotian.

“Tu Yangfei? Xieyue Blood Clan?” Luotian’s mind recalled these unfamiliar names. At this point, he was certain that Tu Yangfei did not belong to the Nine Domains.

“Vast cosmos, truly anything exists!” Luotian sighed inwardly, and at the same time, he blocked Tu Yangfei’s fist.

Though they spoke, their souls did not cease fighting; conversation was merely to disrupt the other’s mindset.

“Kill!” Both Luotian and Tu Yangfei saw through each other’s intentions, no longer wasting words. They resumed their life-and-death battle.

Luotian mastered Dao Suppression and Fanta Attack, while Tu Yangfei had fully mastered three thousand Dao paths. Their battle was evenly matched, their souls continuously weakening each other in the most primal combat.

“Hum…” As Luotian and Tu Yangfei continued their battle, both growing weaker, a wave of energy reached Luotian’s soul.

“Again? This is just the beginning!” Luotian felt a hint of admiration, knowing this wave came from his body—his flesh was about to regenerate again.

“Are you leaving again?” It seemed Tu Yangfei sensed Luotian’s change, his face darkening as he gazed at Luotian.

“Final Kill! Slay the Immortal!” Tu Yangfei knew if he didn’t detain Luotian now, there would be no chance to do so.

The sound of a hum echoed, and Tu Yangfei’s gray soul shot forward like an arrow, simultaneously unleashing the perfected Dao power that enveloped Luotian and Tu Yangfei.

Luotian’s eyes narrowed with solemnity, sensing the opponent had unleashed all his strength. This was a decisive strike capable of annihilating even Luotian before he entered the Feihua Immortal Pool.

“Let me test my newly mastered Feihua Immortal Scripture—Overcoming All with One Power!” Luotian’s mind stirred, no longer holding back. His soul resonated with the Dao’s divine sound, gazing at Tu Yangfei.

The divine sound echoed, golden seals surged forth, instantly engulfing the entire space and merging into Luotian’s body.

The hum returned, and Luotian’s form suddenly solidified, his entire being radiating the power of a celestial god.

“Limit of Power—Overcoming All with One!” Luotian roared, launching his final strike toward Tu Yangfei, who had transformed into an arrow.

“Damn it! I came here for you humans. The Feihua Immortal Scripture of the Epoch’s Master, I never expected you to master an entire scripture in a month! It seems this Feihua Scripture is only suitable for humans, not us!” Tu Yangfei’s face bore intense hatred. His black form expanded again, as if to pierce the entire space, expressing his resentment.

Luotian, like a war god, gazed at Tu Yangfei. At this moment, Luotian felt extraordinarily powerful—Dao Suppression Fist, Fanta Attack, and Overcoming All with One Power. These three divine techniques were all mastered by him.

Luotian was confident this punch could threaten even a Sage of the peak stage. This was his strongest technique, all combined.

“Crack…” As if two thunderbolts collided, an invisible wave erupted from their collision. The black and golden souls continuously devoured each other.

“Peng…” The black soul shattered with a thunderous explosion, but Tu Yangfei’s soul, though powerful, was ultimately no match for Luotian’s overwhelming strength.

Yet after defeating Tu Yangfei, Luotian’s soul also dimmed, his golden eyes displaying a wave of weakness.

“Kid, you wait— I’ll return again. Think just because I lost my soul, I’m dead? You’re still too small-minded about our Xieyue Blood Clan!” The black soul slowly coalesced, addressing Luotian. After speaking, it gradually dimmed again, its voice echoing in the empty space.

At the same time, Luotian’s soul was drawn back into his regenerated body by his flesh. Under the surprised gazes of Diao Yuanshan and Xu Liyi, he slowly opened his eyes.

“How are you, Luotian? Are you going to continue?” Xu Liyi asked, his voice filled with concern. A month’s time had left him stunned.

“No more. Time is nearly up; if I delay further, it might hinder the affairs of the Divine Race. I need to prepare some things!” Luotian replied calmly, his face pale to the extreme.

In the recent battle, he had clearly suffered serious injuries, leaving him weak now.

“You’re so pale—what’s wrong?” Seeing Luotian’s pallor, he asked, unaware of the life-and-death battle Luotian had just endured.

“Nothing, just some injuries. However, this doesn’t hinder my advancement to the late Sagehood!” Luotian’s eyes gleamed with excitement. He extended his hand, and the underground energy slowly flowed toward him.

“Truly变态 (abnormal), just after breaking free from the Heavenly Dao’s suppression, he advanced! When I go in, I’ll also advance!” Xu Liyi’s eyes showed envy.

“You’d also reach late Sagehood after spending a month inside!” Diao Yuanshan chuckled, looking at Xu Liyi. He could sense that the Heavenly Dao’s suppression on Luotian’s back had only a few strokes left. Though it still affected him, it was no longer as massive.

Luotian smiled, his body emitting a series of booming sounds. The ocean of Sage power surged within his dantian, spreading outward.

Everything was natural; Luotian’s aura steadily rose until it stabilized at the late Sagehood level, slightly improving his pale complexion.

“Break the Heavenly Dao’s suppression!” Luotian roared, his voice filled with wild power. The Dao power, combined with the Fanta Attack and Overcoming All with One Power, two ultimate forces surged toward the remaining strokes of the “Sin” character on his back.

“This kid wants to break the Heavenly Dao’s suppression himself— isn’t that too demanding?” Xu Liyi’s eyes showed disbelief, watching the two ultimate forces moving toward the Heavenly Dao’s suppression on Luotian’s back.

“If he truly succeeds, Luotian’s combat power would reach a terrifying level. Even a Sage of the peak stage would have to pay a heavy price if they underestimated Luotian!”

“Hum…” As the three discussed, the two ultimate forces enhanced by the Fanta Attack collided with the Heavenly Dao’s suppression on Luotian’s back.

“Ah…” An intense pain instantly overwhelmed Luotian’s mind, causing him to instinctively scream.

However, Xu Liyi and the others could hear a hint of joy in Luotian’s scream.

Chapter 1108: Exit the Dragon Valley

In the Dragon Valley, within the former subterranean palace of the Star Dragon Ant Clan, Luotian stood there screaming continuously. However, Diao Yuanshan and the others felt a sense of joy in Luotian’s screams.

“Did Luotian succeed?” Yan Jun, a Star Dragon Ant, spoke softly. He knew what the Heavenly Dao’s suppression meant; after all, their clan's Epoch Master had once been suppressed by it.

“He didn’t succeed yet, but he has eroded a bit. To completely erase it through his own means would take an unknown amount of time!” Diao Yuanshan, who was just one step away from the Epoch Initial stage, could clearly discern whether Luotian had succeeded.

“A bit? That’s already enough to show how formidable Luotian’s combat power is!” Xu Liyi sighed, looking at Luotian who had gradually stopped screaming and returned to normal.

“Alas…” Luotian sighed deeply, his eyes slightly disappointed. As Diao Yuanshan said, he had indeed eroded a bit of the Heavenly Dao’s suppression. However, for the remaining strokes on the “Sin” character, it was like a drop in the ocean.

Nonetheless, overall, Luotian was satisfied with this trip to the Dragon Valley and had another plan in mind.

“Let’s go!” Luotian smiled, gazing at the three, especially Diao Yuanshan with a look of joy.

“Indeed, let’s go. In the future, don’t come here unless it’s absolutely necessary!” Diao Yuanshan spoke softly. The four of them took flight, ascending to the lifeless ground.

Just as they had entered, the four flew through the Sunset Marsh and Sunset Mountains, finally reaching the bamboo forest of the Star Dragon Ant Clan.

The four flew swiftly and returned to the location of the Indestructible Life Bamboo, which had been completely taken over by the Star Dragon Ant Clan since the absence of the Blood Magic Glazed Bee. The Indestructible Life Bamboo, a precious location, was naturally occupied by the Star Dragon Ant Clan.

However, as soon as Luotian and the others entered the relocated area of the Star Dragon Ant Clan, they were slightly taken aback.

In their view, thousands of Star Dragon Ants had transformed into their true forms and stood on the ground as if waiting for something. It seemed quite amusing.

“Elder, Yan Jun!” As Luotian and the others appeared, a series of Star Dragon Ants spoke in human language, addressing Luotian and the others.

“What’s going on?” Yan Jun looked puzzled, unsure why his clan members were standing there.

“The Queen Mother has issued an order to wait for your return here and leave this bamboo forest with you!” An elderly Star Dragon Ant spoke respectfully, addressing Yan Jun.

“The Queen Mother also said that from now on, you are the leader of the Star Dragon Ant Clan!” Before Luotian could be shocked about how the Queen Mother had predicted their return, the Star Dragon Ant spoke again.

“What? What are you talking about?” Yan Jun was stunned, asking in confusion.

“Brother, congratulations! You’ve become the leader!” Xu Liyi approached Yan Jun and patted his shoulder.

“Do you know why you became the leader?” Xu Liyi’s eyes glimmered with joy, looking at Yan Jun proudly.

“Why?” Yan Jun looked puzzled, unable to fathom why a young man like himself would be chosen as leader.

“Because of me, of course! Think about it—since I came here, what changes have happened to your Star Dragon Ant Clan? Your clan’s physique was improved with elixirs, and we destroyed the Blood Magic Glazed Bee. You also mastered the Feihua Scripture. All these events happened because of my arrival, right?” Xu Liyi’s eyes glimmered with pride, as if everything truly was due to him.

Yan Jun’s black eyes showed confusion, but soon turned into admiration: “Thank you, Elder!”

“Indeed, don’t worry. After we leave, I’ll protect you!” Xu Liyi spoke generously to Yan Jun and the Star Dragon Ants.

“Thank you, Elder!” The younger Star Dragon Ants looked excited, gazing at Xu Liyi. The older generation of Star Dragon Ants showed confusion, their gazes turning to Luotian, sensing that it was due to this young man’s presence that the Queen Mother had issued such an order.

Luotian and Diao Yuanshan were speechless, watching Xu Liyi boasting. They sighed inwardly; being with someone for a long time would inevitably be influenced by them. Xu Liyi’s current boasting was quite similar to Diao Yuanshan’s.

“Let’s go meet the Queen Mother, and prepare for your departure! I have a feeling something big is about to happen in this Dragon Valley!” Luotian was worried, recalling the soul he had fought in the Feihua Immortal Pool.

Thinking of this, Luotian and Diao Yuanshan headed toward the Queen Mother’s cave.

It was smooth to meet the Star Dragon Ant Queen Mother. Luotian bowed respectfully, saying: “Thank you for your guidance!”

“Go, go quickly. This Dragon Valley will soon experience a great upheaval. I hope you treat our Star Dragon Ant Clan’s people kindly. Now, we have only a few thousand bloodlines left; I don’t want any of them to lose their lives!” The Queen Mother’s voice was aged, yet gentle.

“Don’t you come with us?” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes showed confusion. He had lived so long that he had only addressed the Dragon King, Long Zhan, as “you.” This was his first time using this respectful term for another person.

“Home is hard to leave,” the Queen Mother spoke softly, her voice carrying a calm tone. “I was once so prosperous, living in this Dragon Valley for generations without conflict. But now, only these few thousand bloodlines remain. I’m old and won’t live much longer!”

“Fate’s end,” hearing the Queen Mother’s words, Luotian thought of this term, his eyes showing sorrow.

“Go, I have nothing more to say. You will face many enemies in the future; remember to keep your heart pure and think carefully before acting. The next epoch is different, and you must know your enemies. Improve your strength!” The Queen Mother smiled gently at Luotian.

“They…” Before Luotian could continue, the Queen Mother slowly closed her eyes.

“Let’s go!” Diao Yuanshan patted Luotian’s shoulder. Even he was confused by their words, but he knew the Queen Mother was no ordinary being—perhaps even older than himself.

Luotian nodded and walked out of the cave. Standing outside, he bowed again to the cave before returning to the Star Dragon Ant Clan’s territory.

The Star Dragon Ants had already prepared, even cutting down the Indestructible Life Bamboo. After all, it was a sacred herb and one of the higher-level sacred herbs, beneficial to the Star Dragon Ants.

“Let’s go!” Luotian sighed deeply, scanning his surroundings as he addressed the gathered Star Dragon Ants.

Luotian and the others led thousands of Star Dragon Ants out of the Dragon Valley, traveling without incident. With Diao Yuanshan present, the Imperial Dao Dragon Qi did not harm the Star Dragon Ants.

“Alas, when the Star Dragon Ants were prosperous, we didn’t leave the Dragon Valley. Now that we’ve declined, if it weren’t for Diao Elder’s presence, facing this Imperial Dao Dragon Qi, we would have never escaped the Dragon Valley. This Imperial Dao Dragon Qi could completely annihilate us!” Yan Jun sighed, watching the mocking Imperial Dao Dragon Qi around them.

“Alright, from now on, after leaving this Dragon Valley, I’ll protect you and take you to fly! Dominate the Nine Domains!” Xu Liyi spoke boldly.

The group traveled through the Imperial Dao Dragon Qi for seven days, finally exiting the Dragon Valley and stepping into the Star Domain’s starry sky.

“Finally out! Damn, I was suffocating! Wan Lingkong, don’t let me see you!” Xu Liyi cursed.

“Ah-choo…” In the Grand Demon Fox’s palace in the幽冥 (Yao) Domain, a certain unreliable master of arrays kept sneezing, feeling an inexplicable bad premonition.

“Take the Star Dragon Ants and Diao Elder to the Star Domain for settlement,” Luotian said, bowing respectfully to Diao Yuanshan. “I still have other things to prepare. Stay in the Star Domain; I hope Diao Elder will give me appropriate help when needed.”

“Don’t worry. Perhaps I’ll even advance to the Epoch Stage!” Diao Yuanshan’s body emitted waves, speaking to Luotian.

“Time is pressing; I’ll go first!” Luotian added a few more instructions before his body flashed, becoming a meteor and heading toward the entrance of the Fire Domain.

“What’s the rush?” Xu Liyi looked at Luotian’s disappearing direction, slightly pouting.

“Let’s go. Wan Lingkong should be in the Holy City. I need him to set up the Heaven-Devouring Array and draw out the Epoch Initial stage’s Heavenly Punishment!” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes glimmered with excitement, leading Luotian and the Star Dragon Ants toward the Holy City.

After Diao Yuanshan and others left, disappearing into the starry sky, the Star Dragon Ant Queen Mother slowly opened her eyes. Her aged eyes glimmered with light as she stood up.

At the moment the Queen Mother rose, her altar’s black seals flickered and moved, entering her body.

As the black seals entered her body, the Queen Mother’s appearance rapidly rejuvenated, transforming into a middle-aged woman.

“I can do nothing but delay time!” The Queen Mother spoke softly, taking a step forward. Her body emitted strange waves and vanished into the cave instantly.

Chapter 1109: Preparation

In the Nine Domains, after Luotian entered the Dragon Valley for over a month, the marriage of the Divine Race’s goddess and prince spread throughout the Nine Domains. Luotian’s previous conflict with the Divine Race’s old god king was also known to all.

The entire Nine Domains wanted to see what qualifications this prodigy had to challenge the Divine Race, a colossal force.

As the wedding approached, influential sects and forces in the Nine Domains received invitations from the Divine Race. The Divine Race, aside from the enigmatic冥域 (Ming Domain), ranked among the top three in the Nine Domains. Such a terrifying race, no sect dared to ignore their face.

In an instant, the entire Nine Domains stirred, discussing this Divine Race’s wedding while also heading to the Demon and God Domain. The scene was even more grand than the previous Monster Race’s ritual, with more people.

At this time, the other main character of these discussions, Luotian, appeared at the entrance of the Fire Domain’s Tongtian Mountain. He didn’t disturb anyone but flew into the mountain body beneath Tongtian Mountain, staying there for seven days before leaving.

The very next day after Luotian left Tongtian Mountain, the mountain emitted powerful waves.

Then a long laugh echoed beneath the mountain, startling all the disciples of Tongtian Mountain.

Luotian smiled, walking through the scorching stars of the Fire Domain toward the Four Sacred Star Domains. He sighed softly: “Backups must ensure my loved ones and friends are all safe!”

Luotian knew this trip to the Divine Race would be extremely dangerous. His goal was to ensure he had no worries about his loved ones, securing their lives.

Although Luotian knew that if he retreated, with Diao Yuanshan’s reputation, he could live comfortably in the Nine Domains. But Luotian couldn’t do it; Chen Yunting was his greatest heartache, and since he stepped into the Feiyun Sect, he had never forgotten this heartache.

“If I have any misfortune, Qian Xue, Qiu Chan, Si Xi, I’m sorry!” Luotian’s eyes showed reluctance. He truly didn’t know if he would return alive from the Divine Race.

“But to leave me, you must pay a heavy price!” Luotian’s eyes showed determination. He turned the Tian Gong Ling (Heavenly Palace Seal) in his hand, sending golden light into it.

As Luotian was lost in thought, he appeared at the Four Sacred Star Domains. Looking around at the familiar stars, Luotian sighed; the Four Sacred Star Domains had become much stronger than before. Their overall strength had advanced rapidly in recent years, but compared to the great clans, they still lacked depth.

Two days passed quickly. Luotian returned to Tianyuan Continent, transforming into an ordinary person and walking through it.

Luotian didn’t rush back to the Five Elements Sect but returned to his former Feiyun Sect. The Feiyun Sect had also greatly strengthened. Luotian silently appeared at the tomb of Chen Yunting, his eyes showing a smile.

“Luo…” Behind Luotian, an old man appeared at some point. Seeing Luotian, his body trembled and he was about to speak, but upon seeing the tomb in front of Luotian, he fell silent and withdrew from the cemetery.

“Yunting, this time I will definitely save you and bring you back to Tianyuan Continent!” Luotian’s eyes showed tenderness. He waved his hand, collecting Chen Yunting’s tomb and appearing at the entrance of Feiyun Sect.

The old guardian of Feiyun Sect opened his hazy eyes, his face showing admiration: “Alas… a tragic child!”

The old man spoke and then closed his eyes again. At the moment he was about to close them, his mind suddenly stirred, and a jade bottle silently appeared beside him.

The old man picked up the jade bottle and his face changed slightly, a strong vitality instantly appearing in his perception. A bamboo leaf like jade appeared in his vision.

“Old man, I thank you!” The old man smiled and put the bamboo leaf in his mouth before lazily closing his eyes again.

Luotian left Feiyun Sect, a smile on his face. He could clearly sense that the old guardian had reached the late stage of Sagehood, but to Luotian, it would take a long time for him to break through to the early stage of Sagehood.

For this old man, Luotian felt some gratitude; when the Demon King appeared, he was the first to arrive.

After leaving Feiyun Sect, Luotian walked like an ordinary person through Tianyuan Continent. Looking at the bustling people around him, he showed a satisfied expression.

Ice Island, Luotian’s family. The Ice Island remained bitterly cold, but this was no longer a problem for Luotian. He also didn’t appear ostentatiously but walked the snowy mountains he had once traversed.

Now, due to being Luotian’s family, Ice Island had immense power throughout the Tianyuan Continent. The current head was still Luozhan, while Luotian’s grandfather Lu Xiong and his parents, Luonantian and his wife, had moved to the Five Elements Sect. They didn’t want to manage Ice Island’s affairs anymore.

When Luotian appeared on the snowy mountains, two figures stood before him—two of Ice Island’s strongest individuals and his peers, Lu Qingqing and Lu Han.

Their talents were good, but their opportunities were limited; both had reached the half-step Sagehood stage. They were just one step away from entering the early stage of Sagehood, but in the entire Tianyuan Continent, they were among the strongest.

“Kid, you’ve finally returned!” Lu Qingqing still had her fiery temper, grabbing Luotian’s ear immediately and treating him as before. She didn’t regard this Sagehood late-stage powerhouse at all.

“Sister… I’ve returned, haven’t I? I didn’t even visit my grandfather yet, and I came to Ice Island. How much do you miss me!” Luotian smiled awkwardly, pleading for mercy and not daring to use Sage power, fearing he might injure Lu Qingqing.

“Hmph, you’re smart!” Lu Qingqing smiled triumphantly and glared at Luotian. She extended her hand: “Come on, give your older sister something nice. Not bringing gifts is not good!”

Luotian carefully observed Lu Qingqing and then spoke softly: “Old sister, I feel like you’re getting more like someone. Don’t learn this bad habit!”

But saying that, Luotian still took out two jade bottles and handed them to Lu Qingqing. The resources inside were enough for her to reach the early stage of Sagehood.

“Don’t you dare!” Lu Qingqing sneered, then her eyes glimmered with light as she looked at the jade bottles.

“How long will you stay this time?” Lu Han spoke softly, his voice still cold. With the passage of time, their grudge had long since disappeared; his coldness was just a natural trait.

“Just wandering around, I’ll leave soon!” Luotian smiled and handed Lu Han two more jade bottles.

“Take care of your training, the future Ice Island will rely on you!” Luotian sighed and patted their shoulders. At the same time, a complex scripture appeared in their minds.

While they were shocked, Luotian’s figure gradually disappeared from the spot and continued walking through Tianyuan Continent.

Luotian walked many hometowns, like Tianyuan City, Da’an Forest, Kunlun Mountain, and met many old friends. Naturally, he left them a lot of resources.

“Hum…” Luotian’s figure silently appeared at the square of the Five Elements Sect. Four lifelike statues stood before him.

Luotian’s eyes showed gratitude, gazing at the four statues with incense burning to the utmost. The statues had no dust at all, clearly someone frequently cleaned them.

Luotian looked at the four lifelike statues and knelt down, smiling slightly.

“Master! Your disciple is ungrateful for taking so long to come and pay my respects. One day as a master, forever as a father. No matter how far I go, you are my master, Zhang Daotian!” Luotian spoke softly and lit three incense sticks in Zhang Daotian’s incense burner.

“Demon King, you were once the pillar of the Five Elements Sect. I hope you protect the Five Elements Sect for a long time!” Luotian turned to the second statue, which looked like stone.

“Master Yin, I am grateful for your gift of nine rebirths!” Luotian bowed three times to Yin Tianxiong’s statue.

“Old Xiang, the most unjust one was you. A good北海 (North Sea) master, you were dragged in and lost your life. But don’t worry; our two disciples have grown well. I will teach them well and pass on all my knowledge to them!” Luotian smiled, addressing Xiang Tianming’s statue.

“Hum…” As Luotian slowly stood up to leave, a strange wave entered his mind, causing him to stir. He scanned the four statues.

Luotian felt something was wrong and activated his Purple Extreme Magic Eyes. However, his face soon showed disbelief; under his purple eyes, the four statues all had golden light flickering. Strange energy flowed into the four statues as if something was being nurtured within them.

“Who are you, daring to intrude on the Tianyuan Holy Ground? You’re truly bold!” A chorus of scoldings echoed, and over ten superhuman elders appeared behind Luotian, scolding him.

But Luotian seemed to ignore their scoldings, his eyes fixed on Zhang Daotian’s four statues without any response.
