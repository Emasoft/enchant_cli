“Boy, don’t blame yourself. I was destined to meet my end; it’s just a few days early. After living so long, I’ve had enough!” Ji Jiu You’s spectral form spoke softly, his voice carrying a touch of nonchalance.

“I, Ji Jiu You, have lived for eight million years. The two things I cannot let go of are: first, that my discipleship has no one to inherit it; second, that I have not seen the human race fully flourish!”

“I had long wished to take you as my disciple, but you, little bastard, ran away whenever you saw me. That means we have no connection. Fortunately, you have a good son; retrieve the storage ring at my tomb and deliver what I left for Luo Li.”

“As for the second matter, it falls to you to safeguard humanity’s future. I once spent a million years calculating the fate of the entire human race, foreseeing an impending great calamity. That is why I sent you into perilous realms to accelerate your strength.” Ji Jiu You spoke endlessly, as though he had not noticed Luo Tian.

“Respectfully, I shall strive with all my might!” Though this was merely a phantom of Ji Jiu You, Luo Tian still addressed the apparition.

“There is one more gift for you—hidden beneath my stone effigy. Lift the statue, and you shall find it. I believe you will cherish it greatly. It was this very object that allowed me to live a second life.”

“However, I hope you do not consider rebirth unless it is absolutely necessary. I sense that once one is reborn, though stronger than most quasi-Era Lords and quasi-Kings, they cannot attain the Dao. I do not wish for you to tread our old path.” Ji Jiu You spoke again, causing Luo Tian’s heart to tremble.

“To be reborn and yet fail to attain the Dao!” Luo Tian, though suspecting this all along, still felt a jolt of shock upon hearing it.

“To be reborn is already an act of defiance against fate. Heaven is fair; if one could attain the Dao after rebirth, it would be unjust for those of this life.” Ji Jiu You continued.

“Enough talk. Strive, and I hope you one day ascend to the celestial realm.” Ji Jiu You gave no time for Luo Tian’s reply, and with that, the spectral form dissolved.

“Master…” Luo Tian watched Ji Jiu You’s apparition vanish, shouting aloud, but it was futile.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his heart filled with reverence and guilt. His gaze grew resolute.

“His soul has only just dissolved a month ago; it should not have wandered far.” Luo Tian murmured, his eyes filled with contemplation.

“Since Master still has unfinished matters, I shall grant you another life. Even if rebirth is impossible, I will ensure you witness my attainment of the Dao, see humanity conquer the Ancient Kings, and behold Luo Li’s dominion over the Nine Realms.” Luo Tian rose slowly, his eyes alight with determination.

“Rebirth!” Luo Tian waved his hands, striking countless blows. The Rebirth Fist surged forth, and a vast Rebirth Passage materialized within the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower. The gray passage emitted a low hum, appearing above Luo Tian’s head.

“Open!” Luo Tian’s hands moved in intricate gestures, and a torrent of Era Power surged from his palms. The golden Rebirth Passage manifested instantly, colliding with the gray passage with a thunderous crash.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed through the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower. The massive Rebirth Passage was torn open, and waves of gray mist erupted from the fissure.

“Roar…” A low growl echoed from within the passage, as countless soul fragments, devoid of consciousness, instinctively surged forth.

“One thousand… ten thousand… a hundred thousand…” Countless gray souls, mindless and aimless, rushed toward the breach.

“Return!” Luo Tian sneered, his Soul-Subduing Master’s aura radiating. The souls, terrified by his presence, trembled and retreated into the passage.

“Hum…” A resonant hum filled Luo Tian’s form, as actual gray souls burst forth from his body. His hands formed seals, shaping a long dragon of gray runes that merged into his flesh.

Luo Tian gazed at the gray passage, then bit his lip, sending a tangible soul into its depths.

“Hum…” Upon entering the passage, waves of distortion struck Luo Tian’s soul, altering his expression.

A relentless refining force gnawed at Luo Tian’s soul, not his own but his memories—seeking to erase them entirely.

“Seal the Soul!” Luo Tian acted swiftly, sealing his memories with intricate gestures. He could not afford to lose them; that would leave him no place to weep.

Having prepared, Luo Tian followed the path of the souls, his gray eyes scanning for Ji Jiu You’s soul.

No need to actively seek; the Rebirth Passage itself exerted an invisible pressure, pushing Luo Tian deeper. Yet he flew with all his might, his soul moving faster than others.

Luo Tian tread carefully, gazing at the passage that seemed to lead to another world. He felt an abyss of infinite depth ahead, a terrifying aura emanating from its depths.

Chapter 1628: Yellow River (Huangquan)

Within the gray Rebirth Passage, Luo Tian’s soul soared toward its depths. He searched desperately for Ji Jiu You’s soul, determined to rescue it from the passage.

“Hope I arrive in time!” Luo Tian’s heart raced, as rejection forces grew stronger with each passing moment. He was not part of this Rebirth Passage and lacked the right to enter, so it rejected him.

This was why Luo Tian dared act; others, even Gu Tianshu, would suffer greatly within the passage. The soul fragments surrounding him were no match for anyone, but Luo Tian’s Soul-Subduing Master aura repelled them. The mindless souls shrank back, even creating a path for him.

“Hum…” The hum resonated through Luo Tian’s soul, as he traversed the vast Rebirth Passage.

“Where…?” Time passed slowly; Luo Tian flew for an hour, his speed increasing as the pull grew stronger. He feared that if he lingered longer, he would be overwhelmed and unable to escape the passage.

A day passed; Luo Tian abandoned flight, letting the pull drag him forward. The speed was terrifying, even causing the mindless souls around him to twist unnaturally.

The refining force on Luo Tian grew stronger, and the seals guarding his memories weakened.

“Not long enough! I can’t endure this!” Luo Tian muttered, unwilling to press deeper. Though he wished to save Ji Jiu You, he could not risk his life.

“Three more days—if I still cannot find him, I must leave!” Luo Tian resolved, his vision shifting.

“What if this passage leads to rebirth? What if I end up reincarnating?” The thought struck him. He recalled Sun Mengru’s half-soul rebirth, which took years to locate. If he too were reborn, all his cultivation would be lost, and he’d have to start anew. That would render his years of effort meaningless.

“Too terrifying!” Luo Tian dared not continue the thought, resolving to avoid rebirth.

Three days passed in silence; Luo Tian’s soul abruptly halted as a powerful pull deformed it.

“Damn!” Luo Tian roared, his soul battling the force. He glanced one last time—should he find Ji Jiu You, he would leave.

“There!” Yet this glance revealed Ji Jiu You’s aged soul, distinct from others. Though old, its aura was far stronger than the surrounding souls, and its memories remained largely intact.

“Go…” As Luo Tian was lost in thought, Ji Jiu You’s soul seemed to vanish from his sight.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian’s soul surged forward, reaching Ji Jiu You’s aged form. He seized the soul, preventing it from being pulled further.

Though he found Ji Jiu You, this moment had driven them deeper into the passage. The relentless pull made Luo Tian feel powerless.

“Damn!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his eyes wild with desperation. He knew this was a life-threatening situation; if he could not escape, he would be doomed.

“Roar!” Luo Tian roared, dragging Ji Jiu You’s soul, which bore a bewildered expression, toward the breach he had shattered.

But fate was cruel; Luo Tian underestimated the Rebirth Passage. Here, his will held no sway. Even he could not resist its force.

Luo Tian exerted all his strength, but it was like a drop in the ocean. He merely delayed their progress, yet the pull grew stronger with each moment.

“Rippling… rippling…” After an indeterminate time, a sound of rushing water echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. A colossal aura surged from behind him, causing his face to pale with fear.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s heart clenched as the water sounds grew louder. He no longer cared for anything, his soul igniting with gray flames and rushing backward.

“Flee… leave me behind!” Ji Jiu You, stirred by Luo Tian’s actions, spoke urgently. His soulless eyes regained clarity, and an invisible wave pushed Luo Tian, who sighed in relief but turned to glance.

Yet that single glance sent a tidal wave through Luo Tian’s mind, his eyes wide with disbelief.

A yellow river stretched across the Rebirth Passage, though distant, its waters radiated an overwhelming terror.

“That’s the Yellow River! Do not look—once you enter, you are reborn!” Ji Jiu You warned Luo Tian, whose face darkened as if he had lost two legs. He burned his soul furiously, rushing toward the breach.

“Yellow River!” Luo Tian’s mind reeled; he had never imagined the passage ended here.

He recalled memories of the Yellow River: some dying souls claimed to have seen it, its waters capable of purifying and elevating the soul.

Heavens had nine levels; so did the earth, with the Yellow River marking the first of nine hellish realms. Mortals had never seen it; only the dead encountered it.

“Flee! Do not take me—my soul is already beyond this world!” Ji Jiu You urged.

“Master, you have done much for me; I will not let your final wish go unfulfilled!” Luo Tian’s soul burned with gray flames, his resolve unshaken.

“Creak…” As Luo Tian desperately pulled Ji Jiu You’s soul toward the exit, a black boat drifted on the churning Yellow River. Two gaunt figures stood upon it, their presence sending shivers through Luo Tian.

“Master said this one was remarkable; we’ve come to fetch him,” the two gaunt figures spoke, their eyes locking onto Luo Tian struggling to pull Ji Jiu You’s soul.

“Huh?” Their expressions shifted, their eyes widening at the sight of Luo Tian’s soul.

“Is that a soul?” They exchanged glances, then stood upon the Yellow River’s waters.

“Is this possible?” Their years of ferrying powerful souls had never seen such a scenario.

“Master said this soul was the one to fetch,” they murmured, confusion spreading. “But he didn’t come to the Yellow River; how can we proceed?”

Luo Tian, in soul form, felt a chill as their aura sent him into shock.

“Who are they? How can there be such terrifying beings in this world?” Luo Tian’s mind reeled, stunned to learn of life within the Rebirth Passage.

“Does this passage lead to another world?” Luo Tian’s mind was shattered, his soul burning faster.

“Come here, boy! Follow us; we’ll take you to a great fortune!” The two gaunt figures barked.

“Idiot would follow you!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, ignoring their words and fleeing with all his might.

“Not good! If we fail to deliver, Master will skin us,” they fretted, watching Luo Tian recede.

“Boy, come back! We’ll take you to a better place!” They resorted to temptation.

“I don’t care!” Luo Tian replied, dragging Ji Jiu You’s soul toward the breach. The Yellow River’s terror grew distant.

Chapter 1629: Forging Bones, Merging Soul

Hearing Luo Tian’s defiance, the two figures’ noses nearly snapped. Though his soul was formidable, they could crush him with a gesture. Yet bound by rules, they could not leave the Yellow River, watching Luo Tian vanish.

“Unyielding! Is this world’s people so uninterested in power?” They glared at Luo Tian’s desperate flight, gritting their teeth.

“Boy, I have a ghostly artifact to give you; return with us!” They persisted, offering their most precious treasure.

“No!” Luo Tian refused firmly. Though he knew their gift was invaluable, he wasn’t foolish—his strength would be at their mercy.

“Hum…” Under immense pressure, Luo Tian unleashed his potential, finally breaking free of the two figures’ sight.

“Damn you, boy! Don’t die, don’t enter rebirth! If I learn of your death, I’ll make you a beast in your next life!” They could do nothing but watch Luo Tian flee.

“Roar!” Luo Tian roared, his soul burning against the pull, desperately flying toward the exit.

As time passed, the pull weakened, easing Luo Tian’s burden. Yet his soul was drained, trembling violently. His return speed lagged behind his entry.

“Day one… day two…” Time passed slowly; Luo Tian’s soul ceased burning, the pull diminishing. Though no longer ablaze, his soul was near collapse.

“Keep going…” Luo Tian clutched Ji Jiu You’s soul, their forms blurred. Yet he refused to give up, his mind hazy but purpose clear: to escape with Ji Jiu You.

“Boy, release me; we’ll both fail!” Ji Jiu You urged, his voice carrying solace. Luo Tian’s resolve had moved him deeply.

“I can escape!” Luo Tian replied, his eyes resolute. Gray soul flames reignited, carrying Ji Jiu You as a streak of gray light.

“Ten thousand zhang… a thousand zhang…” Time passed; Luo Tian, in a frenzy, found the breach he had shattered.

“Almost there… almost there…” Luo Tian’s soul, ethereal and fragile, seemed ready to scatter.

“Go!” As Luo Tian neared exhaustion, he and Ji Jiu You’s soul burst through the passage.

“Hum…” At that moment, Luo Tian’s mist-like soul merged into his body, reuniting with it.

“Huff…” Luo Tian’s pale eyes opened, and Ji Jiu You’s soul floated before him.

“Damn!” Yet upon seeing Ji Jiu You’s soul, Luo Tian’s face darkened further.

Though rescued, Ji Jiu You’s soul continued to dissipate, its essence flowing into the breach.

“Useless… fate cannot be defied!” Ji Jiu You smiled, his gaze serene.

“I refuse! My fate is mine to decide!” Luo Tian panted, his soul drained but eyes resolute.

“Seal the Soul!” Luo Tian gestured, summoning his remaining soul power to form gray seals around Ji Jiu You’s soul.

Though the seals slowed its dissipation, it still faded, restrained by an unseen force.

“Boom!” Luo Tian waved his hand, a golden skeleton materialized in the hall—the one he had obtained from the Bone Forest.

“This…” Ji Jiu You gaped at the glowing skeleton.

“The skeleton of the Supreme Lord!” Luo Tian murmured, a smile on his lips: “Perhaps fate has its design.”

“You saved Xingxuan, shortened your own lifespan. You went to the Bone Forest to strengthen yourself and obtained this Supreme Lord’s skeleton to prolong my life!” Luo Tian sighed.

“Seal the Soul!” Luo Tian gestured again, his soul power striking Ji Jiu You’s.

“Hum…” Ji Jiu You’s soul was drawn into the Supreme Lord’s skeleton.

“Still cannot be sealed? Rules forbid it?” Luo Tian frowned, his eyes darkening.

“I defy fate today! If even the Supreme Lord’s bones cannot contain a soul bound by fate, I’ll use仙骨 (immortal bone)!” Luo Tian declared, then waved his hand. A crushing pressure filled the hall as a green hand bone materialized in his grasp.

“What is this?” Upon summoning the green bone, the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower trembled. The tower’s spirit appeared behind Luo Tian.

The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower’s spirit, a master within the tower, felt its power crushed by the green bone.

“This is an immortal’s hand bone!” Luo Tian’s face was grave. He advanced toward the Supreme Lord’s skeleton, his blood boiling as he gripped its hands with both arms.

“Open!” Luo Tian roared, his might shattering the skeleton’s hand. He then attached the immortal bone to it.

“Hum…” Upon joining the two bones, a repelling force surged from both, resisting each other.

“Divine Sword of Heaven’s Will!” Luo Tian pressed the bones together, shouting. The Divine Sword of Heaven’s Will manifested as a radiant blade, slicing his wrist and spewing blood. The crimson stream formed a dragon, engulfing the Supreme Lord’s skeleton.

As the blood touched the bones, an unexpected change occurred: vitality surged from them. The previously repelling hands no longer resisted; Ji Jiu You’s soul ceased dissolving, merging with the bones.

“How is this possible!” The three in the hall—Luo Tian, Ji Jiu You, and the tower’s spirit—were stunned.

“Master, this should at least let you endure for centuries!” Luo Tian’s face was pale; his blood and soul had been drained, but his eyes glowed with hope.

“Perhaps fate has its design. If I were not a Soul-Subduing Master or Rebirth Body, even retrieving your soul from the passage would not have revived you!” Luo Tian smiled.

“You’ve gone to such lengths! Using your life force to defy fate, extending my life by a century?” Ji Jiu You’s soul resided within the Supreme Lord’s skeleton, speaking to Luo Tian.

Though weak, Ji Jiu You could recover easily. This skeleton—Supreme Lord’s bones fused with immortal bone—might even allow him to defy fate.

“Master, rest here while I handle the remaining tasks!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the breach he had shattered. He waved his hands, and the Rebirth Bridge in his dantian roared. His power surged, forming a golden bridge that connected to the breach.

The hum echoed; with Luo Tian’s repair, the golden Rebirth Bridge was absorbed into the passage, turning gray and vanishing from view.

“I do not know how long my recovery will take; I hope to be ready when the Ancient Kings attack. But now, you are fully capable of facing all challenges. With Gu Tianshu and Dongbo Xin, plus many Era Lords’ offspring, defeating the Ancient Kings should be no problem!” Ji Jiu You’s skeletal form spoke, his voice calm. Though a skeleton, with Ji Jiu You’s presence, flesh would regrow in time.

“By the way, take what I left for you and Luo Li; I no longer need it!” Ji Jiu You added, then sat cross-legged within the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower. His body radiated divine laws.

Luo Tian’s face was pale, but his eyes sparkled with excitement. No matter the cost, he had rescued Ji Jiu You. After the Bone Forest, his perspective had grown; he no longer sought merely to attain the Dao but to become an immortal—after all, Gu Qianxue might be in the celestial realm.

Chapter 1630: Ji Jiu You’s Legacy

“Boom!” The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower echoed with thunder. Luo Tian hesitated not, striking Ji Jiu You’s statue.

“Boy, that was my statue; you smashed it so casually!” Ji Jiu You felt uneasy.

“Haha, Master, you’ve already returned! This thing is no longer needed!” Luo Tian smiled, his gaze turning to the golden light rising from the statue.

Golden light spread, illuminating the gray hall with a terrifying aura. Luo Tian’s face lit up in delight.

“Hum…” The golden light rose, revealing a golden scroll.

“The Book of Eras!” Luo Tian’s face showed disbelief; he had encountered a page of the golden book here.

“If I’m not mistaken, you must have this as well. Your luck is truly absurd!” Ji Jiu You’s voice carried amusement.

“When we first met, I sensed your soul contained the Book of Eras. I even considered attacking you!” Ji Jiu You spoke softly.

Hearing this, Luo Tian felt a chill; he recalled their first meeting, when Ji Jiu You had seemed like an ordinary fortune-teller. None could have guessed he was a second-life powerhouse. If Ji Jiu You had attacked him then, he would have died countless times over.

“Yet I calculated a fortune and abandoned the idea. This book is not for ordinary people; obtaining this page was already a rare opportunity. But you possess the original Book of Eras—your fate is extraordinary, and your future achievements may be terrifying!” Ji Jiu You’s voice carried admiration.

“Hum…” As before, Luo Tian’s dantian golden Book of Eras glowed, flying out to merge with the page. It then settled as before, unresponsive to Luo Tian’s attempts at communication.

“Never mind!” Luo Tian murmured, not attempting to decipher the new page. With Ji Jiu You’s precedent, he did not wish to risk a second life.

“Master, do you know what those two beings on the Yellow River were? Who are they?” Luo Tian then recalled the two figures who had threatened him.

“I do not know, but they are likely not from the Nine Realms. Their strength far surpasses ours; even in my prime, I could not match them!” Ji Jiu You’s voice carried concern. He too had been surprised by such beings’ existence.

“Yet they are not immortals; otherwise, they would not have offered me a ghostly artifact!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed.

“Do not overthink it; perhaps when you reach a certain realm, you’ll encounter such beings!” Ji Jiu You advised.

“I fear I’ve offended them; what if…” Luo Tian’s face twisted into a bitter smile, recalling their threat: “Don’t die.”

“Rest easy; they could have killed us both easily. Their inaction suggests a rule restrains them. If they entered the Nine Realms, no one could match them—not even a reborn Era Lord!” Ji Jiu You comforted, smiling.

“Hmph! Master, rest here and recover. I’ll go out now!” Luo Tian nodded, his curiosity satisfied. He took the storage ring Ji Jiu You had prepared for Luo Li, bowed to Ji Jiu You, and stepped out of the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower.

“Strive to cultivate; seeing those beings proves the Era Lords are not the end!”

“Perhaps you should spread news of my resurrection!” As Luo Tian took his first step, Ji Jiu You’s voice echoed in his ears.

Hearing this, Luo Tian paused, his eyes thoughtful: “I’ll prepare; time is tight.”

“Do as you wish!” Ji Jiu You’s voice carried a smile, then fell silent.

“Hum…” Luo Tian appeared outside the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower, where many awaited anxiously.

“Out!” Sun Mengru instantly appeared before Luo Tian. As the tower’s master, she knew all of his actions. When he entered the Rebirth Passage, she nearly rushed in to join him.

But she knew her presence would be useless; she might even hinder Luo Tian. Only when he emerged did her heart finally ease.

“Nothing’s wrong…” Luo Tian, though exhausted, smiled reassuringly.

“Everything is settled; stay here and recover!” Gu Tianshu spoke softly. They had learned of Luo Tian’s deeds from Sun Mengru, and even Gu Tianshu was amazed. He could not have done what Luo Tian had.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded, needing recovery. He could not travel now.

“Alas… so boring!” Upon hearing Luo Tian and Gu Tianshu, Mao Dedu sighed deeply.

“Not boring! Not boring!” Yao Chen’s eyes gleamed, scanning Mao Dedu and others before pointing his staff at him.

“Come on, little Mao, let’s spar!” Yao Chen ordered, his tone霸道 (domineering).

“Why me?” Mao Dedu protested, his eyes flickering with mischief. He glanced at Luo Tian’s group, seeking to involve others.

“Join us!” Seeing Mao Dedu’s glances, Yao Chen called out to Xu Liyi and Tianluo.

“Mao Dedu, you bastard!” Hearing this, the others cursed him for dragging them into it.

“Let’s fight a few rounds!” Gu Tianshu smiled, observing the chaos before him.

“What?” Their eyes widened in disbelief at Gu Tianshu’s words, staring at him. Even Luo Tian opened his eyes wide with shock.

Who was Gu Tianshu? Since his emergence, he had been undefeated. Even with the heavens’ suppression, they had failed to kill him. With his absurd talent, he had lived a second life. To Luo Tian, Gu Tianshu was invincible; even now, he felt no match for him.

“Happily!” Yao Chen’s face lit up; he had long desired this but hesitated due to Luo Tian’s reverence for Gu Tianshu.

“Let’s go!” Gu Tianshu smiled, rising slowly as his aura climbed.

“Alright!” Yao Chen’s eyes narrowed; he felt immense pressure from Gu Tianshu, even as a quasi-Era Lord. Yet he still felt inadequate before him.

“Monkey, this is it! Gu’s personal strike—no one can escape!” Seeing Gu Tianshu and Yao Chen face off, Mao Dedu’s group felt excitement.

“Finally, someone to teach this monkey a lesson! Always bullying us!” Mao Dedu exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement. To him, Gu Tianshu was now a grandfather-like figure.

“Buddha’s Attack Art vs. the Battle Saint’s Method?” Luo Tian’s face showed interest, diverting part of his attention to their fight.

“Boom!” Yao Chen’s body radiated immense power, charging toward Gu Tianshu with a determined aura.
