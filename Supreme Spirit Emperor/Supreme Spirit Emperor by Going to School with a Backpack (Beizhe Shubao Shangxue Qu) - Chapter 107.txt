Li Xingfa appeared and let out a long sigh. Upon seeing Chen Zhanbiao and Xu Lizi, his face displayed great surprise. He turned to flee but collided with Luo Tian's body, sending him flying backward and landing at Chen Zhanbiao's feet.

Chapter 523: Eating ()
Chapter 523: Eating

Seeing a person materialize beneath his feet, Chen Zhanbiao's face bore an odd expression. He could not fathom why Luo Tian had summoned someone with a wave of his hand, and he gazed at Luo Tian with admiration: "Hehe, I didn’t expect you to be so skilled in combat and even capable of magic tricks. Teach me this trick, okay!"

Luo Tian and Xu Lizi were amused by Chen Zhanbiao's words, while Li Xingfa gradually regained his composure. He realized that Luo Tian’s relationship with the two robbers had changed, and he dared not speak further. He stood beside Luo Tian, his eyes filled with fear as he gazed at Chen Zhanbiao, whose physique resembled a mountain.

"Hey... the person Luo Tian conjured—can you speak? You seem so weak, like you can't withstand a punch!" Chen Zhanbiao, seemingly fascinated by Li Xingfa, approached him and raised his massive hand to pat Li Xingfa's shoulder.

"Luotian, save me!" Li Xingfa, seeing the palm as large as a fan, displayed fear and cried out for help.

"Haha... he can't withstand your punch!" Luo Tian seized Chen Zhanbiao's descending hand and laughed.

The four had landed on the ground, with Xu Lizi leading them toward the nearby Xuanbing City. With Chen Zhanbiao's simple nature, their journey was filled with mirth. Particularly, Chen Zhanbiao’s obvious interest in Li Xingfa made Luo Tian and Xu Lizi laugh constantly.

After walking for about an hour, the four finally arrived at Xuanbing City.

Xuanbing City was the nearest city to Ice Peak Island and a renowned place in the surrounding area. The power of Ice Peak Island was immense in the Southern Region, and Xuanbing City served as its largest stronghold in the secular world. It was managed by an outer branch of the Luo family from Ice Peak Island.

Though Xuanbing City was not far from Ice Peak Island, a chill could already be felt. Yet the city bustled with activity and was lively. On the main street, people of all kinds walked by—cultivators and commoners alike. It was immediately evident who was a cultivator and who was not.

Due to the cold, commoners wore thick woolen coats, while cultivators ignored the chill and wore thin long robes.

The four walked along the main street, but Chen Zhanbiao's massive frame made them stand out. Many commoners cast fearful glances at him.

Ignoring the stares, they entered the largest inn in Xuanbing City. Upon entering, a server greeted Xu Lizi and Chen Zhanbiao with a smile: "Master Xu, Master Chen, the usual spot?"

"Keep the same seat, but change the food. Today my friend is treating us; Chen Zhanbiao can eat his fill, so arrange it accordingly," Xu Lizi smiled and spoke to the server.

Hearing Xu Lizi's words, the server’s eyes lit up and he even cast a pitying glance at Luo Tian. He remembered how Xu Lizi had brought Chen Zhanbiao into Xuanbing City half a year ago, causing a commotion in the city's restaurants.

However, seeing Luo Tian’s calm expression, the server said nothing more and nodded before rushing to the kitchen.

The four entered a private room. The room had no decorations except for a large table that occupied most of the space, with several chairs placed beneath it.

After sitting down for a while, the scent of food continuously filled their noses, prompting Luo Tian to nod slightly. Indeed, Xuanbing City's largest inn was no match for its speed in serving dishes.

Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes gleamed, and drool flowed uncontrollably as he gazed at the entrance with greed, like a baby awaiting its mother’s milk.

After some casual conversation, footsteps echoed, and several servers finally entered under Chen Zhanbiao’s eager gaze.

As they lifted the curtain, Luo Tian involuntarily twitched his lips. A fully roasted pig exuded a fragrant aroma, carried to the table by several people.

"Awoooo..." Chen Zhanbiao roared, instantly pulling the pig to his front as if forgetting others were present. His massive palm tore off a leg and began gnawing on it.

Luo Tian smiled at Chen Zhanbiao’s hearty eating, feeling a faint admiration for this simple-minded man who was oddly endearing.

"Quickly eat, Luotian..." Xu Lizi urged Luo Tian and grabbed a piece of pork into his mouth.

Li Xingfa, exhausted from the journey, was also hungry and ate without hesitation.

However, before they had eaten much, Chen Zhanbiao had already devoured half the pig within a few breaths.

Luo Tian, who had known Chen Zhanbiao’s appetite beforehand, involuntarily twitched his eye. He regretted having said "eat until full."

Second dish... third... fourth...

Luo Tian and Xu Lizi had already finished, but Chen Zhanbiao seemed unaffected, chewing endlessly as if engaged in a fierce battle.

"Ten... one hundred..." Under Luo Tian’s startled gaze, Chen Zhanbiao had eaten over four hundred dishes. When the server entered and informed Xu Lizi that the kitchen was out of ingredients, Chen Zhanbiao finally stopped.

He wiped his greasy mouth and hands, the table filled with dishes. His face bore an unhappy expression as he grumbled: "Next time, you could bring more food. It’s annoying that we had to go to others’ homes!"

"Go to another place..." Hearing Chen Zhanbiao’s words, Luo Tian's lips curled slightly.

"Let’s go to the next one!" Xu Lizi smiled and urged Luo Tian.

"Hehe, a good person! Finally full!" Chen Zhanbiao clapped his hands and gazed at Luo Tian with a sense of gratitude.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian nodded, and under Xu Lizi’s smiling gaze, he paid the bill.

The payment left Luo Tian in distress. Three hundred million yuanqi stones had been spent on a single meal, with Chen Zhanbiao consuming it entirely. That was equivalent to ten high-grade artifacts.

Li Xingfa was awestruck, and he felt grateful that he hadn’t offered to pay. He had intended to act like a rich man, but he failed to convince Luo Tian. His eyes carried gratitude and pity as he looked at Luo Tian, who was paying.

Chapter 524: Satisfaction ()

"Haha... full, full... Luotian, you are truly a good person! I haven’t eaten so much in over a year!" Chen Zhanbiao patted his stomach, smiling contentedly as he sat on an oversized chair and shouted loudly, causing the ceiling of the private room to tremble.

Luo Tian and Li Xingfa gaped, watching Chen Zhanbiao gulping down a bucket of chicken soup.

Luo Tian was stunned, scrutinizing Chen Zhanbiao’s slightly distended stomach and sighed inwardly. This man must be a reincarnated beast, so capable of eating!

After dining at the first restaurant, the four had eaten through all the restaurants in Xuanbing City before hearing Chen Zhanbiao’s declaration of being full.

Throughout the journey, Luo Tian had spent countless yuanqi stones. After this final meal, he calculated that he had spent a total of ten million yuanqi stones.

Ten million yuanqi stones were beyond the reach of ordinary warriors. Seeing Xu Lizi’s gleeful gaze, Luo Tian felt uneasy and doubted how Xu Lizi had sustained Chen Zhanbiao for so long. He questioned whether Xu Lizi’s claim of donating the remaining money to help the poor was credible.

"Thank you for your hospitality, Luotian!" Xu Lizi smiled and clasped his fists toward Luo Tian.

"Go to hell..." Luo Tian cursed, but if it weren’t for his promise of "eat until full," he would have already shouted curses.

Li Xingfa stared at Chen Zhanbiao as if watching a monster, his heart trembling. This trip to the Southern Region had only earned him one million yuanqi stones, not enough for even one meal of Chen Zhanbiao’s.

"Bang... who the hell is eating? Don’t eat so loudly, disturbing my mood!" As Luo Tian was in a bad mood, the door of the private room was kicked open.

The words had barely fallen when a young man in a woolen robe appeared before them, his face filled with impatience. Behind him were several attendants.

"Ugh..." Upon entering, the young man saw Chen Zhanbiao lying there like a mountain and instinctively shivered.

Although Chen Zhanbiao had no aura of cultivation, his massive physique and fierce presence were enough to unsettle any body-refining stage warrior.

After shivering, the young man glanced at Luo Tian and Xu Lizi. He could not discern their cultivation levels, while Li Xingfa was merely at body-refining stage seven. As for the seemingly fierce man without any aura, he had no cultivation at all.

The young man shook his head and felt reassured. He glared at Luo Tian with a displeased expression: "Eat properly, or leave if you don’t want to. Don’t make a ruckus and spoil my mood!"

"You bastard, who didn’t fasten their pants? You even speak such nonsense!" Xu Lizi heard the young man’s words and smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

Hearing Xu Lizi's words, Luo Tian and Li Xingfa laughed heartily. Chen Zhanbiao, who was simple-minded, looked at his pants and then blushed slightly.

"Big brother... my pants weren’t fastened... I drank too much soup and forgot... hehe..." Chen Zhanbiao scratched his head and fastened his pants.

"Haha..." Luo Tian and Li Xingfa couldn’t help but laugh. Even the young man’s attendants smiled, though they restrained themselves from laughing in his presence.

"You dare insult me?" The young man’s face turned red with anger, pointing at Xu Lizi. He was about to retaliate but Xu Lizi gave him no chance.

Xu Lizi patted Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulder and spoke again: "What do you mean, 'what'? This is your long-lost father. Come and recognize him! I am your grandfather!"

"Big brother, I haven’t even married yet..." Chen Zhanbiao blushed and said naively.

"You shut up! I say it is, so it is. This was your mistake when you urinated in the latrine and accidentally urinated out, do you remember?" Xu Lizi saw Chen Zhanbiao’s cooperation and felt excited. He had never seen Chen Zhanbiao support him before, but today he was so cooperative that Xu Lizi felt overjoyed.

He seemed to have consumed some rare treasure, and he began cursing with a flood of words. He cursed the young man’s ancestors down to his sons and grandsons.

Luo Tian and Li Xingfa stared in awe at Xu Lizi’s verbal onslaught, their faces showing admiration. They had never expected Xu Lizi's mouth to be so sharp. In Luo Tian’s memory, only Zheng Xin could match him in speed of speech, but even she was no match for Xu Lizi’s ability to curse.

"Indeed, there are always higher mountains and people beyond," Luo Tian sighed softly.

The young man’s face turned red, his blood rushing to his head. He pointed at Xu Lizi but could not speak. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to retaliate; it was because Xu Lizi’s words shifted so quickly that the young man couldn’t keep up.

"Kill him! Kill him!" The young man roared at his attendants, his voice filled with madness.

Hearing his master’s command, the attendants regained their senses. They had never seen their master so insulted before. They nodded and, as several bone-devouring stage warriors entered the small private room.

"Haha... it was so satisfying! Zhanbiao, next time you must cooperate with me. Got it?" Xu Lizi grabbed a cup of tea and took a sip, his face showing satisfaction.

"Ah, your son’s attendants are coming to deal with me. Don’t just sit here! Zhanbiao, go teach this kid a lesson. After eating, you should move around and not just eat without working!" Xu Lizi patted Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulder and pointed at the approaching men.

"Discipline? What discipline?" Chen Zhanbiao was still pondering what "discipline" meant when the bone-devouring stage warriors had already rushed toward them.

"Idiot, it means to beat them! Can’t you see they’re about to attack us?" Xu Lizi slapped a bone-devouring stage warrior and sent him flying toward Chen Zhanbiao, shouting.

Chapter 525: The Luo Family of Xuanbing City ()

"Haha, a fight! Good! But these people don’t seem tough at all!" Chen Zhanbiao looked down on the bone-devouring stage warriors and instantly appeared before one, throwing a punch.

A simple punch carried overwhelming power, striking the bone-devouring stage warrior’s chest.

What was Chen Zhanbiao's strength? Even Luo Tian could not match him in hand-to-hand combat. How could he face a few bone-devouring stage warriors?

The punch landed, and the sound of bones breaking echoed. The bone-devouring stage warrior was sent flying backward, his chest caved in and spitting blood. He barely breathed, and without timely treatment, he would not survive.

"Ah... they’re too weak. I didn’t even use my full strength! I’ve gained some power from eating... sorry!" Chen Zhanbiao looked embarrassed and scratched his head.

"Breaking Waves Finger!" One bone-devouring stage warrior, stunned by the sight of Chen Zhanbiao, stared at him as if he were a monster. He launched his martial art.

"Chu chu..." A blue finger shot out, accompanied by the sound of flowing water.

"Bang!" The inn could not withstand the impact of the martial art and collapsed instantly.

The blue finger, carrying immense power, struck Chen Zhanbiao’s back, who stood in front of Luo Tian.

"Bang!" The remaining bone-devouring stage warriors, seeing the high-level martial art of Xuanbing City had hit, displayed joy.

But soon after, the young man and the bone-devouring stage warriors widened their eyes in disbelief.

Chen Zhanbiao had been hit by the martial art but showed no reaction, not even moving his massive body. He only looked at the bone-devouring stage warriors with anger.

"You guys are cheating! You attacked me!" Chen Zhanbiao roared and rushed toward them, like an elephant charging into a swarm of ants.

"Bang... bang... bang..." One punch per person, and within moments, the bone-devouring stage warriors were thrown away like chicks. None of them could move.

"You’re next! My brother said you are my son, so today I’ll teach you a lesson!" Chen Zhanbiao smiled foolishly and appeared before the young man.

At this moment, the young man was stunned. He hadn’t expected that a big man with no aura of cultivation could be so terrifying, even unable to harm him with high-level martial arts or withstand his punches.

The inn had collapsed due to the martial art’s impact, and their figures were exposed on the street. Passersby who saw the commotion gathered curiously.

But when they saw the young man being lifted into the air by Chen Zhanbiao, their faces changed. They looked at Luo Tian and his companions with admiration.

"Who are these people? Is this the young master of the Luo family, Luohaoxiu? How dare they act like this in Xuanbing City?" The crowd immediately started discussing.

Hearing the crowd’s murmurs, Luo Tian and Xu Lizi furrowed their brows. Especially Li Xingfa’s face turned pale, his eyes trembling as he looked at the young man called Luohaoxiu.

"Big brother, this person who said you are my son—what should I do with him?" Chen Zhanbiao didn’t care about the situation and asked Xu Lizi in a low voice.

"Son?" The crowd saw Chen Zhanbiao calling the young man "son," and their mouths twitched. This was the first time they had heard someone call Luohaoxiu "son" in Xuanbing City.

"What else can we do? Just like every time we did business, right? Today’s expenses are considerable. Let me compensate Luotian for it!" Xu Lizi, who was fearless of heaven and earth, instructed Chen Zhanbiao.

"Okay..." Hearing Xu Lizi’s words, Chen Zhanbiao's face lit up. He immediately pulled the storage bag from Luohaoxiu’s waist, knowing it was filled with money. With money, he could eat again.

"You should let me go. This is our Luo family’s territory in Xuanbing City. Our Luo family is the master of Ice Peak Island!" Luohaoxiu, with a sinister expression, threatened.

"Big brother, maybe we should let him go? This..." Li Xingfa looked anxious. As a mere body-refining stage seven, how could he dare to offend the Luo family?

"It’s fine..." Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He hadn’t expected the Luo family to be so arrogant.

"Crack..." Chen Zhanbiao snapped Luohaoxiu’s legs and walked toward Xu Lizi.

"Done, big brother!" Chen Zhanbiao spoke loudly.

The crowd gasped as they saw Chen Zhanbiao, a fierce man, snap Luohaoxiu’s legs. They hadn’t expected these people to be so bold.

"He is a Luo family member. He should be worth a lot!" Xu Lizi rubbed his chin, smiling playfully as he examined Luohaoxiu.

Seeing Xu Lizi’s gaze, Luohaoxiu, whose legs were broken and sweating coldly, felt an inexplicable chill. At this moment, Luohaoxiu was completely terrified by the group.

"Nothing much... it’s rare to meet a Luo family young master, so we should sell him for a good price!" Xu Lizi spoke.

Luo Tian and Li Xingfa looked puzzled, unsure what Xu Lizi was up to. They vaguely suspected something, especially Li Xingfa, a merchant by background, seemed to sense the scent of yuanqi stones.

"Who among you has a Luo family member? Go tell the city’s lord to save this kid. Demand one million yuanqi stones, or else we’ll castrate him and hang him at the city gate!" Xu Lizi shouted to the surrounding crowd.

"Pu..." Hearing Xu Lizi’s words, Luohaoxiu could not hold back and spat blood. His face was filled with fear as he looked at Xu Lizi, who now seemed like a devil to him.

The surrounding crowd inhaled sharply. They wanted to know who these young people were, daring to openly beat Luohaoxiu and even kidnap him for ransom.

Among the crowd, several people had fierce expressions and walked toward the crowd’s edge, obviously going to inform the Luo family.

Li Xingfa and Luo Tian were also stunned by Xu Lizi, both sighing inwardly. This Xu Lizi was truly a natural for being a mountain bandit.

Chapter 526: The Lord of Xuanbing City ()

In the streets of Xuanbing City.

Luo Tian and Xu Lizi, along with four others, were surrounded by people. The crowd’s faces all showed amazement. For years, it had never happened that someone would openly challenge the Luo family’s authority in Xuanbing City.

The Luo family of Xuanbing City originated from Ice Peak Island. Since Xuanbing City was an asset of Ice Peak Island and served as its face, anyone wishing to enter Ice Peak Island would pass through Xuanbing City.

Thus, Xuanbing City had become a bustling metropolis. The city’s lord must have been closely connected to the main branch of Ice Peak Island's Luo family.

Challenging Xuanbing City was equivalent to challenging the Luo family of Ice Peak Island. Though there had been people who had caused trouble in Xuanbing City before, those who escaped the city were never spared from Ice Peak Island’s pursuit and met a bad end.

Now, for years, the Luo family of Xuanbing City had never faced such a challenge. The crowd was curious about who these young people were and what background they had to dare defy Ice Peak Island.

Time passed slowly, and after an hour, a powerful pressure rose from the crowd’s edge, as if it could swallow everyone. Combined with Xuanbing City's coldness, people instinctively shivered.

"Have they arrived?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows and extended his spiritual sense like waves.

His spiritual sense was met with a wave of power, causing him to frown more deeply.

In his spiritual sense, an old man with half-white hair walked forward with cold killing intent. Behind him were two old men of similar age, their faces dark and gloomy. Three old men were followed by nearly a hundred bone-devouring stage warriors, their faces filled with overwhelming battle intent and marching in formation. They were clearly well-trained.

"Damn, I feel like we’ve gotten into a big mess!" Xu Lizi’s playful expression faded as he cursed.

"It's complicated," Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He hadn’t expected Xuanbing City to have such strength. This force could rival the Feiyun Sect in the Northern Region and might even be more terrifying.

Chen Zhanbiao, however, didn’t understand what they were saying. He scratched his head, instinctively sensing danger but trusting Xu Lizi so much that he didn’t take it seriously.

Under everyone’s trembling gaze, the three old men appeared in front of them with dark expressions.

The crowd naturally parted to make way for the three old men, fearing they might be killed by a single slap.

"Grandfather, save me!" As if seeing hope, Luohaoxiu shouted loudly, his face twisted with hatred toward Luo Tian.

Li Xingfa immediately collapsed to the ground, fear in his eyes. These hundreds of people could easily crush him. Li Xingfa even regretted accompanying Luo Tian; if it were himself, no one would care about a lowly body-refining stage seven.

"Who are you? Why did you provoke us in Xuanbing City? Who gave you the courage?" The eldest old man, with a dark face, ignored Luohaoxiu lying on the ground.

"Big brother and them don’t need to talk, just kill them! I don’t believe anyone would dare touch us!" One of the old men said impatiently.

"Kill..." Hearing the old man’s words, the hundred bone-devouring stage warriors roared and their battle intent surged into the sky.

Luo Tian and Xu Lizi were serious, not fearing these three old men but the hundred bone-devouring stage warriors behind them. They could sense that these warriors were like one entity, with an inexplicable默契 (mutual understanding).

Luo Tian quickly placed Li Xingfa into his Nailing Spirit, as the sheer pressure of the hundred bone-devouring stage warriors would have been unbearable for him.

"Ah?" Seeing Luo Tian’s move, the three old men displayed confusion. Having lived in the Southern Region and controlled Xuanbing City with close ties to Ice Peak Island’s main branch, they had seen countless treasures. Yet they had never encountered such a treasure before.

"Which sect are you from?" The eldest old man seemed to think these three were disciples of a major sect. It was better to clarify first, otherwise they might offend someone they shouldn’t.

"We are bandits! We have a conflict with your grandson. You know our Luo family is rich, so we need to eat too! Just toss out one million yuanqi stones and we’ll release your grandson!" Xu Lizi grabbed Luohaoxiu as a pawn and threatened.

"This..." Seeing Xu Lizi still so calm, the onlookers showed some surprise. They hadn’t expected that even now, this person still dared to threaten them and demand money for ransom.

"Die!" The two old men, seeing Xu Lizi’s arrogance, displayed anger and their killing intent turned into a tangible force. Their spiritual strength of Soul-Refining Late Stage was suddenly released, and they leaped toward Xu Lizi.

"Go back..." Chen Zhanbiao’s massive body blocked Xu Lizi, and he threw a punch to block their attack.

"Step back... step back..." The two old men were repelled, their faces filled with disbelief.

The third old man who hadn’t attacked also looked at Chen Zhanbiao with concern, surprised that his two brothers had been repelled by a boy without any spiritual energy.

"Give them three breaths to release Luohaoxiu and apologize to the Luo family. This matter will be settled," the eldest old man said coldly.

"Are your Luo family so unreasonable?" Luo Tian stepped forward, his face icy and eyes cold.

"One breath..." The old man’s voice was cold and unyielding, ignoring Luo Tian's words.

"Pu..." Seeing the old man ignored him, Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. He brandished his spear and pierced Luohaoxiu's throat.

Luo Tian’s decisive killing of Luohaoxiu made the crowd gasp in shock. They hadn’t expected these three to be so bold, but they also looked at the trio with pity. With Luohaoxiu’s death, their conflict with the Luo family had become irreconcilable.

Chapter 527: Heaven's Heart Ice Array ()

Luo Tian’s action even surprised Xu Lizi, who then smiled slightly and clenched his fists. He sighed inwardly: "It seems today won’t end peacefully!"

"Are you afraid? You can leave first!" Luo Tian smiled and spoke to Xu Lizi.

"Eating others’ food makes one indebted. Who am I to let my foolish brother eat your meal? Remember, after the fight, treat me to a full meal!" Xu Lizi spoke without retreating.

"Eating, eating! I like eating and fighting!" Chen Zhanbiao shouted without a care.

Seeing the three act so calmly, people around them instinctively stepped back. After all, a Soul-Refining stage battle was beyond their reach. Even the residual power would be unbearable for them.

"Kid, you’re looking for death. No one has ever left here after causing trouble!" Seeing Luohaoxiu’s death, the old man counted his fingers and displayed a sinister expression.

It wasn’t that he particularly cared about Luohaoxiu’s life, but Luo Tian's action had clearly slapped his face.

"Kill..." There was no more to say, the old man transformed into a dragon and rushed toward Luo Tian.

The other two old men also displayed killing intent, rushing toward Xu Lizi and Chen Zhanbiao.

"Single-element Soul-Refining Late Stage, dare to attack me?" Luo Tian sneered and brandished his spear. Seven-colored spiritual energy surged around him, and he launched a strike with the "Breaking Stone" technique.

"Seven-element!" The crowd watching from afar displayed amazement, gazing at Luo Tian as if he wore a colorful robe. Their faces showed disbelief.

"This person must be an outstanding prodigy from a major sect!" They marveled, unable to imagine such an extraordinary physique would be a mountain-dweller.

The old man’s body also paused slightly, his sharp eyes narrowing as he drew a sword and struck.

The spear and sword clashed with a humming sound, causing the onlookers to step back again.

"Old dog, go up to heaven and save innocent people!" Luo Tian sneered and extended his spiritual wings, flying thousands of feet into the sky to await the old man.

"Are you afraid?" The old man had intended this, as Xuanbing City was his domain. Destroying a little would hurt him.

His pale blue wings fluttered slightly, and his body instantly appeared before Luo Tian. While flying, he struck with a palm.

"Surging Waves of the Sea..." The old man displayed hatred and unleashed his martial art, his palm expanding several times. A sound of flowing water echoed as it struck Luo Tian.

"Low-level Xuanbing City martial art, dare to harm me?" Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. He ignored the massive palm and used "Sealing Steps" to appear before the old man, striking with a "Piercing Life" punch.

"Bang..." Luo Tian’s figure moved like a ghost, dodging the old man's palm technique and striking his chest with a fist.

"Fast speed!" The old man finally showed seriousness, thinking he could defeat Luo Tian with his Soul-Refining Late Stage. But now it seemed he was wrong.

"Finally, you treated me as an equal opponent? Who will win is still uncertain!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with brilliance and he used "Sealing Steps" again, appearing before the old man.

"Chu chu..." But after a punch was thrown, the old man’s body suddenly turned into water and fell into the air.

"Ah? A fake?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing a gust of wind behind him. His eyes narrowed and he turned around to see a massive hand instantly striking his body.

"Pu..." Unprepared, Luo Tian was sent flying and spat blood.

He stopped his body after flying a hundred feet, sighing inwardly. Indeed, the Soul-Refining Late Stage was no match for him, and Ice Peak Island's Luo family had many tricks.

"Kid, swear an oath to serve my Luo family for a thousand years today and I won’t pursue it!" The old man’s body appeared before Luo Tian.

"Only you? You’re not even worth it! I’ve fought against Soul-Refining Late Stage before!" Luo Tian sneered and his spiritual energy surged again. His spear roared, and three "Breaking Spears" techniques erupted toward the Luo family old man.

"Mirage of Water and Flowers!" The old man displayed disdain, his body turned into water again and disappeared from Luo Tian’s sight.

Seeing the old man disappear, Luo Tian sneered and his lips curled slightly. His cold voice echoed: "Capture, Soul, Seal!"

An invisible soul-sealing technique flew from Luo Tian’s hand toward the void.

"Bang..." A faint sound echoed, and the old man appeared before Luo Tian’s sight, his face pale from being hit by the soul-sealing technique.

At the same time, the old man’s face showed disbelief; he didn’t know how Luo Tian found him.

"You are still a Soul-Refining Late Stage, your spiritual sense only reaches the Cultivation Mid-stage. How dare you play tricks before me!" Luo Tian laughed loudly, not giving the old man a chance to recover. He quickly launched the "Five Elements Generating Human King Seal."

At the same time, Luo Tian rapidly changed his movements. The sky seemed to become heavy with each of his hands’ movements.

The old man punched through the Human King Seal, catching his breath for a moment before feeling an immense pressure from above. His face tightened slightly.

"Can’t let him succeed!" The old man’s heart trembled, looking at the sky.

After speaking, the old man's body surged toward Luo Tian like a wave, his palm striking repeatedly at Luo Tian and the sky’s fully revealed "Opening Heaven" seal.

"Opening Heaven!" Luo Tian's eyes showed coldness and he roared, slamming his hands downward.

Boom! The void echoed with thunderous sounds, causing the onlookers to tremble and gaze at the sky with reverence.

In an instant, the golden seal carried heavenly authority and slowly moved downward, colliding with the old man’s blue spiritual palm.

"Bang..." The pale-blue spiritual palm, upon touching the "Opening Heaven" seal, was instantly dispersed by its overwhelming pressure.
