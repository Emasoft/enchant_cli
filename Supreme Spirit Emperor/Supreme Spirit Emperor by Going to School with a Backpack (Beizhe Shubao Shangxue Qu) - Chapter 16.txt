“Ah? Who's hand did I grab? What business is that to you?” Luo Tian didn't pay attention to the young disciple's words, but instead fixed his gaze on Pei Letian.

“You! Youngster, this is Greenwood Peak, not your Dan Sect! It's not a place for you to act recklessly!” Zhang Hanlin, seeing Pei Letian’s gaze, felt reassured and coldly said.

At the same time, several people behind Pei Letian quickly dispersed, surrounding Luo Tian.

Because he was holding hands with Luo Tian, they were also surrounded together. Seeing these people, Gu Qianshao recognized them—these were essentially Pei Letian’s henchmen. Her brows furrowed.

“Senior Sister Qianshao, step aside. This has nothing to do with you. He insulted me; I must teach him a lesson!” Zhang Hanlin spoke coldly.

“Senior Brother Pei, take your people and leave!” Gu Qianshao was sharp-witted; she already understood Pei Letian’s intent. A hint of disdain rose in her heart, and her gaze turned slightly cold.

“Little fellow, do you only dare to hide behind a woman? If you're a man, come out and show your courage from before! Ha!” Zhang Hanlin continued mocking.

Luo Tian glanced at the cultivators’ levels of these young disciples, a cold smile curling his lips: “Are you sure? Want me to step out?”

“You may have high talent, but now you're only Refining Body Seventh Level. Even with the Five Elements Body, insulting me means you'll pay the price!” Zhang Hanlin’s gaze was contemptuous. To him, a group of Refining Body Seventh and Eighth Level disciples defeating one Refining Body Seventh Level Luo Tian was more than enough.

“Fine, then it's your own fault!” Luo Tian slowly released Gu Qianshao’s hand, coldly stepping forward toward Zhang Hanlin. His body trembled; though facing several people, his overwhelming aura pressed against the young disciple.

“Luo Tian! How can you fight without me?” Gu Lei laughed heartily, clearly thrilled after a long time without action. He stepped in front of Luo Tian.

Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong wore expressions of concern, their bodies flickering as two waves of Refining Body Eighth Level aura spread out. Zhong Kaiyang spoke: “Luo Tian, since you called us brothers, we saw this and couldn’t just stand by!”

Luo Tian’s heart trembled with gratitude, his face showing appreciation. These two were only casual acquaintances, yet they showed such loyalty and righteousness, risking enmity with Pei Letian, a direct disciple of Greenwood Peak.

Luo Tian could imagine that if they got involved in this matter, their future in Greenwood Peak would be fraught with difficulties.

Thinking of that, Luo Tian waved his hand: “This small matter doesn’t need your trouble!”

“Enough of the nonsense. Senior Sister Qianshao, please move aside to avoid injury; Pei Senior Brother would be upset,” the youth said impatiently, seeing Luo Tian’s group hesitating.

“Luo Senior Brother, do you think by making us leave, this Pei fellow would let us off? With his petty mind, I believe our days won’t be easy from now on!” Zhong Kaiyang spoke loudly.

“Little fellow, you have some brains. Since you’re so smart, just cut off one arm and I’ll beg Pei Senior Brother to let you go!” Zhang Hanlin said, secretly wary of these two. They were well-known disciples in Greenwood Peak.

“Hmph, such smooth words!” Zhong Kaiyang’s face remained cold.

“Then don’t blame me for being ruthless, brothers—attack!” Zhang Hanlin waved his hand and rushed toward Luo Tian, aiming to capture him and report back to Pei Letian for glory.

Chapter 72: Intercepted ()

Seeing Pei Letian’s growing displeasure, Zhang Hanlin no longer hesitated and launched an attack on Luo Tian.

The other disciples Pei Letian brought, seeing Zhang Hanlin attacking Luo Tian, wouldn’t let him monopolize the glory. They all shouted and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Seeing everyone attack Luo Tian, Gu Lei and Zhong Kaiyang quickly found opponents to block the others. Though each took on one person, three still reached Luo Tian’s front.

“Senior Brother Pei, what does this mean?” Gu Qianshao, seeing them attack without warning, coldly shouted at Pei Letian.

“Senior Sister Qianshao, it’s their own matter; I can’t interfere. Besides, I also want to know if he has the qualifications to be with you!” Pei Letian, hearing Gu Qianshao’s words, coldly glanced at Luo Tian being attacked by three people before gently speaking to Gu Qianshao.

“Who I’m with and whether I’m worthy—your business isn’t it!” Gu Qianshao, hearing Pei Letian’s words, her voice turned icy. She was deeply disgusted by Pei Letian’s shameless behavior.

After Gu Qianshao spoke, her body activated wood and fire dual-element spiritual energy, rushing toward the three attacking Luo Tian.

But before she reached them, Pei Letian flickered and blocked her path: “Senior Sister Qianshao, just watch. If you’re hurt, I’d be in trouble with the peak master!”

“You! Good, good! That Pei fellow really has no shame. Why didn’t I think you were this kind of person before?” Gu Qianshao laughed bitterly, no longer showing her previous gentleness, reverting to the tone of a big sister from Tianyuan City.

Pei Letian, stunned by Gu Qianshao’s tone, was momentarily taken aback before laughing again, still blocking her path.

“Peng!” As Gu Qianshao and Pei Letian were locked in a standoff, a sound of a body falling echoed.

“Pei fellow, this trash wants to insult me?” Luo Tian sneered as he drove a fist to repel Zhang Hanlin’s attack, then kicked another Refining Body Seventh Level disciple flying.

Zhang Hanlin felt bitter; he had thought three disciples attacking one Refining Body Seventh Level Luo Tian would be a sure win. Yet this Luo Tian was so abnormal—his movements were orderly and without flaws, even injuring another companion.

Seeing Luo Tian’s ferocity, Pei Letian was also surprised. Though he knew Luo Tian wasn’t easy to deal with, three disciples attacking him would still take some effort. Yet Luo Tian had handled it so effortlessly.

To think Luo Tian was stronger than him? Pei Letian wouldn’t believe it. He, a Refining Body Ninth Level with water and wood dual-element body type—hadn’t he suppressed his cultivation? He would have already reached the Bone-Subjugation Realm.

A mere Refining Body Seventh Level Luo Tian, even with the legendary Five Elements Body—how could he be stronger? A deep confusion arose in Pei Letian’s heart.

As Pei Letian pondered, the battle on Luo Tian’s side was nearing its end. Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong, already well-known disciples, easily knocked two disciples to the ground within a short time.

Gu Lei, though only Refining Body Sixth Level, had a poisonous technique that even Luo Tian had fallen for. The disciple he fought was the most tormented, with bursts of green smoke and white mist. Though he wanted to dodge, his speed couldn’t escape the slightest contact.

“Peng…” The disciple finally couldn’t endure, spitting white foam and convulsing on the ground.

“Hmph! Even with the thirteenth poison, you couldn’t last? How dare you try to defeat Luo Tian? He endured over a hundred!” Gu Lei muttered, clearly unimpressed with his opponent.

Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong’s mouths twitched; they hadn’t expected this amiable youth to be the most ruthless among them. They instinctively moved away from Gu Lei.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s battle was also nearing its end. Zhang Hanlin and another disciple, seeing the situation was bad, activated their martial arts.

“Unyielding Wood Technique!”
“Wood Leg Sealing!”

Zhang Hanlin shouted, using his martial arts to attack Luo Tian.

Seeing them use their techniques, Luo Tian’s lips curled in amusement, unafraid. He used his Left Hand: Flame Dragon and Right Hand: King’s Seal, launching them effortlessly.

“Boom…” A thunderous explosion echoed at the base of Wood Peak.

“What’s going on? Someone fighting at the base of Wood Peak? How bold! Let’s go check who it is!” Some curious disciples from Greenwood Peak rushed down the mountain.

Luo Tian deflected their martial arts without stopping, seizing the opportunity to dash toward a disciple and mercilessly punch his chest with five spiritual energies.

“Crack…” A crisp sound of bones breaking echoed, the disciple spitting blood and flying backward.

Zhang Hanlin saw Luo Tian dare to injure a Wood Peak disciple, his eyes flashing with cruelty: “Luo Tian! You’ve caused big trouble. Daring to stir up trouble in our Wood Peak!”

Zhang Hanlin was afraid, seeing the crowd gathering at the base of Wood Peak. He shifted blame onto Luo Tian and retreated behind Pei Letian, heart pounding.

“Shameless! Three against one and still injured two—how dare you blame others!” Gu Lei mocked Pei Letian, watching to see what he would say.

Luo Tian also watched Pei Letian with interest, wondering how he’d deal with him next.

“Hmph! Luo Tian, you trespassed my Greenwood Peak and injured one of our inner disciples. If you’re sensible, come with me to apologize to the peak elders. If not, don’t blame me for subduing you myself!” Pei Letian’s face was cold, but despite his shock at Luo Tian’s strength, he remained indifferent.

“Pei Letian, you really have no shame! I Gu Qianshao was blinded by my eyes; I once considered you a righteous man, but now I see your treachery!” Before Luo Tian could answer, Gu Qianshao replied.

Hearing Gu Qianshao’s outburst, the surrounding Greenwood Peak disciples looked oddly at Luo Tian and Pei Letian. Some sharp-witted ones realized what was happening.

“Luo Tian, give yourself three breaths to decide. If you don’t agree, I’ll have no choice but to act!” Pei Letian eyed Luo Tian with mockery.

Luo Tian gazed at Pei Letian, recalling Li Xiuping’s lofty demeanor. Though Pei Letian didn’t show it, Luo Tian could sense he was the same type of person—only Li Xiuping had brains, while Pei Letian had raw strength but simple-mindedness.

“One breath!” Before Luo Tian could think further, Pei Letian’s mocking voice echoed.

“Then if you want to catch me Luo Tian, see if you have the ability!” Luo Tian said without a care. His suppressed aura rose again slowly.

Chapter 73: Wood King Seal ()

Luo Tian gazed at Pei Letian. He knew only by displaying enough strength could he震慑 these Greenwood Peak disciples; otherwise, if today he was trampled by Pei Letian, it wouldn’t just be Luo Tian mocked but the entire Dan Sect. That was something Luo Tian could never allow.

He never wanted to burden others because of himself, just like when he first asked Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong to leave—to avoid dragging them into trouble in Greenwood Peak.

“Hum…” A Bone-Subjugation Mid-Stage aura formed from Luo Tian, spreading outward.

“Bone-Subjugation!” Zhang Hanlin’s lips twitched as he stared at Luo Tian’s aura, his heart shocked.

The surrounding Wood Peak disciples also looked surprised at Luo Tian, not expecting him to be so fierce as reaching Bone-Subjugation Mid-Stage.

Gu Qianshao watched Luo Tian, naturally knowing his aura was only Bone-Subjugation Mid-Stage but his strength remained the same. She worried.

“Wow! Luo Tian is so fierce! When did he advance to Bone-Subjugation? I didn’t know!” Gu Lei muttered inwardly.

“Twenty-year-old Bone-Subjugation Mid-Stage? Impossible!” Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong also looked in disbelief.

“You’re Bone-Subjugation? No! Definitely not! Though your aura is Bone-Subjugation, from the fluctuations when you fought earlier, it’s definitely Refining Body!” Pei Letian said solemnly.

After Pei Letian explained, people understood. They all felt Luo Tian’s spiritual energy fluctuations and sighed deeply—twenty years old with Bone-Subjugation Mid-Stage was too shocking.

“How? Do you think this aura alone can beat me? Senior Sister Qianshao, the one you chose is talented but seems a fool!” Pei Letian sneered at Luo Tian.

“Beat or not beat you? Try and find out! I wonder how much of your strength you can use under this Bone-Subjugation aura!” Luo Tian didn’t mind revealing his intention—to let Pei Letian use only a fraction of his strength under the Bone-Subjugation aura.

“Why say so? Why such trouble? I’ll lower to Refining Body Seventh Level, only then can I crush you and let Senior Sister Qianshao know she chose wrong! I am the only one suitable for her! Only I, Pei Letian, am fit for her!” Pei Letian laughed.

“Equal-level fight, I’ll make you not recognize your mother!” Luo Tian mocked.

“Good! Since you think it unfair, I’ll fight on equal terms! Let you be convinced!” Pei Letian confidently said. He believed he wasn’t inferior to Luo Tian in equal-level battles, a common pride among geniuses. Each genius believed they had no rivals at their level, reflecting the cultivation philosophy of true geniuses.

Pei Letian finished speaking and his body emitted green light, his face flushed as he murmured: “Wood King Seal!”

People hearing Pei Letian’s words wore expressions of admiration, clearly impressed by his decision to lower his cultivation and fight on equal terms.

“Wood King Seal, a secret technique of the Grand Elder. I didn’t expect Pei Letian to have learned it!” Zhong Kaiyang looked surprised, clearly familiar with the technique Pei Letian was using.

“What’s this secret technique?” Gu Lei asked, confused, while Gu Qianshao listened closely.

“Wood King Seal, a technique using wood spiritual energy to seal the enemy’s cultivation, causing it to drop. If facing someone much weaker, it might even strip their cultivation!” Zhong Kaiyang explained quietly.

Hearing Zhong Kaiyang’s words, Gu Lei and Gu Qianshao wore serious expressions. Imagine if during a life-or-death fight, your cultivation dropped by one level—how terrifying that would be.

Seeming to sense Gu Qianshao and Gu Lei’s fear, Zhong Kaiyang continued: “But don’t worry too much. Wood King Seal takes a long time to perform, and it can’t be interrupted. If interrupted, all effort is wasted, and your own cultivation might even drop. Thus, the Grand Elder often seals disciples’ cultivation to a certain level for training.”

Hearing this, Gu Qianshao and Gu Lei relaxed, sighing in relief. If it were as they feared, this technique would be terrifying.

During the three’s conversation, Pei Letian’s body emitted a series of cracks, and his spiritual energy fluctuations gradually changed.

“Refining Body Eighth Level… Refining Body Seventh Level!” Pei Letian’s cultivation dropped to Refining Body Seventh Level under people’s astonished gazes.

Luo Tian was also surprised at Pei Letian’s transformation. Naturally, he heard Zhong Kaiyang’s explanation and was secretly shocked at the world’s wonders—how could someone create such a technique? It was truly mind-blowing.

“Crack…” Pei Letian’s cultivation stopped at Refining Body Seventh Level. He stretched his body, a mocking expression on his face.

“How about that? Are you satisfied now?” Pei Letian stretched, his tall body looking charming under the sunset. Some female disciples gazed at him with stars in their eyes.

Luo Tian secretly nodded, admiring Pei Letian’s character—only such courage would ensure his future achievements.

“Alright, let’s go! Let me see how strong the Five Elements Body of Dan Sect really is! The Five Elements Body will surely be my stepping stone to Pei Letian!”

Pei Letian lightly smiled, his cultivation dropped to Refining Body Seventh Level. Though the opponent was of equal level, he remained fearless and battle-ready.

“Ready anytime!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, dispelling the Bone-Subjugation aura and showing confidence.

Since Luo Tian’s emergence, he had always fought above his level, never facing geniuses on equal terms. Clearly confident, he didn’t believe Pei Letian at Refining Body Seventh Level could beat him. That was his pride.

“Peng!” Without a word, both attacked directly without using martial arts.

Both retreated simultaneously, clearly showing their footprints deeply imprinted on the stone ground.

“Not disappointing, the Five Elements Body. Though my cultivation dropped, my body strength is Refining Body Ninth Level—yet I could block your attack!” Pei Letian was secretly shocked but his battle spirit grew fiercer, a look of excitement on his face.

Luo Tian was also shocked by Pei Letian’s strength. He knew his own body strength best; against Refining Body Eighth Level, he could still maneuver with it, sometimes even gaining an upper hand. But against Pei Letian, the contact point felt slightly numb.

“Ten Thousand Trees Rebirth Finger!”
“Water Rushing to the Mountains!”

Pei Letian knew his physical advantage wouldn’t beat Luo Tian, so he changed his hands and shouted: two martial arts from each hand.

A翠绿色 (emerald green) finger formed from Pei Letian’s hands, while the other side seemed like a flood of water spiritual energy gathering into a river.

Because water generates wood, the Ten Thousand Trees Rebirth Finger, upon contact with water spiritual energy, surged further, pressing toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 74: Wang Yulan ()

As Pei Letian unleashed his martial arts, the base of Greenwood Peak echoed with admiration. Female disciples screamed in excitement.

“Yellow Grade Advanced Martial Art!” Gu Qianshao and others looked serious, not expecting Pei Letian to master two Yellow Grade Advanced Martial Arts. Especially that emerald green finger, enhanced by water spiritual energy, radiated terrifying fluctuations—people were alarmed. Though they trusted Luo Tian’s strength, they still worried.

Luo Tian also stared seriously at that massive finger approaching him, his figure seeming like an ant compared to it.

Luo Tian didn’t dare to be careless, his fingers moving: “Five Elements Mutual Generation, Flame Dragon Hand!”

A fire dragon burst from Luo Tian’s hand, rushing toward the emerald finger.

Luo Tian was now Refining Body Seventh Level; Flame Dragon Hand had accompanied him since the beginning, and he used it skillfully.

“Roar…” The fire dragon roared, wrapping around the finger. Wood generates fire; this attribute suppression was evident.

Normally, a Yellow Grade Lower Martial Art against an Upper Grade one had no chance of winning. But Luo Tian used Five Elements Mutual Generation, the fire dragon containing five attributes in a cycle. Because wood generates fire, it managed to block the emerald finger.

“Hmph! It’s just attribute suppression. Don’t forget, my Water Rushing to the Mountains also suppresses your fire attribute!” Pei Letian sneered.

“Try it then!” Luo Tian was also tense, controlling the fire dragon to block the finger before turning toward the massive water spiritual energy.

“Sss…” But the fire dragon seemed like a cow entering a tiger’s mouth, emitting sizzling sounds and disappearing without a trace. A faint mist filled the sky.

“Hmph! See what you use to block!” Pei Letian sneered, watching the water spiritual energy continue toward Luo Tian.

“Again!” Luo Tian roared, forming another fire dragon to meet the water spiritual energy.

“It’s not enough!” Luo Tian didn’t stop, and in an instant, three fire dragons flew from his hands.

“Sss…” A vast mist formed, obscuring people’s vision. Everyone stared intently to see what was happening inside.

“Blocked!”

Pei Letian felt his martial arts being continuously weakened, eventually reduced to pitiful levels. His calm face finally showed shock—he hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s spiritual energy to be so abundant, as if endless.

The mist cleared; Luo Tian panted heavily, though the consumption was significant, he still blocked Pei Letian’s attack. He secretly marveled at how formidable these other peak direct disciples were—even now, he had to be fully alert.

“Blocked! Luo Tian truly is a genius of the Five Elements Body, managing to withstand two Yellow Grade Advanced Martial Arts!” People marveled.

“Hmph! You didn’t see Pei Letian use his full strength. If he did, this kid would already be down! Look at him still panting!” Female disciples, hearing the admiration, retorted.

“Indeed strong. You have the qualifications to witness my strongest move. Though this move is difficult for a Refining Body Seventh Level to perform, losing to it proves your strength!” Pei Letian didn’t waste words. His hands continued changing, waves of fluctuation gathering around him.

Luo Tian knew the showdown was coming. His hands began forming his strongest martial art: Five Elements Mutual Generation, King’s Seal.

People watching saw the fluctuations from both hands and instinctively stepped back—they felt they weren’t ready to withstand the collision of their martial arts.

“Extreme Water Great Wood Palm!” Pei Letian roared wildly, unable to accept that he hadn’t defeated Luo Tian for so long. He unleashed his secret technique.

“Xuan Grade Martial Art!” People gasped, surprised to find Pei Letian also knew Xuan Grade Martial Arts.

Xuan Grade Martial Arts were rare; Yellow Grade Martial Arts were common in the Five Elements Sect, but Xuan Grade was rarely seen among inner and outer disciples. To learn it required even more difficulty, only direct disciples could obtain it from their masters.

Gu Qianshao and Gu Lei wore worried expressions; they truly feared for Luo Tian now. Though they knew Luo Tian had a technique with great power, whether he could use it at this moment was uncertain.

Luo Tian’s face also showed tension; his spiritual energy reached its peak, and his hands formed blurs: “Five Elements Mutual Generation, King’s Seal!”

A golden seal slowly凝聚 (congregated) from Luo Tian’s hands, its intricate patterns clear. On the seal, a faint “兵” (soldier) character was visible, radiating terrifying fluctuations.

“What are you doing?” A烦躁 (restless) voice echoed, barely distinguishable as a woman’s.

At the moment the woman’s voice fell, both martial arts being formed were abruptly interrupted, and the terrifying fluctuations vanished into the world.

“Respect Master Senior Sister!” People hearing this clear voice bowed respectfully toward the figure descending from the mountain.

“Respect Master Senior Sister Wang!” Pei Letian, seeing the arrival, was momentarily stunned before bowing.

Luo Tian saw everyone slightly bending their bodies, leaving only Gu Lei and himself standing straight—drawing attention.

“Are you the Luo Tian recently causing a stir in the Five Elements Sect?” The woman stepped forward, facing Luo Tian.

“Yes, I am Luo Tian.” Luo Tian answered the woman’s question, eyeing this person called Master Senior Sister.

Luo Tian had heard of Wang Yulan, the master senior sister of Greenwood Peak. The woman looked around twenty-three or so, slightly older than Gu Qianshao. Rumors said Wang Yulan entered the Five Elements Sect around the same time as Zhang Ziping, but Luo Tian couldn’t tell her age was over thirty.

Seeing Wang Yulan’s appearance, Luo Tian recalled the bold Gu Qianshao—both had a similar aura of strength.

“What’s going on? Why such a commotion in my Greenwood Peak?” Wang Yulan stared at Luo Tian, her Bone-Subjugation Late Stage cultivation pressing toward him.

“Senior Sister Wang, it’s like this: I saw the legendary Five Elements Body of Dan Sect and felt a urge to spar with Luo Tian, causing disturbance. Please don’t blame me!” Pei Letian spoke before Luo Tian could answer.

“I didn’t ask you! Did I tell you to speak?” Wang Yulan glared at Pei Letian, displaying her masterful authority.

Chapter 75: Dispersed ()

Wang Yulan’s cold face glared at Pei Letian, as if a thousand years of ice.

Pei Letian felt his entire body cold, as though falling into a thousand-year icy pool. He wanted to move but couldn’t; his face showed a bitter smile.

“Is that what he said?” Wang Yulan’s voice echoed again, turning to Luo Tian and pressing her aura toward him.

Luo Tian felt his body suddenly sink, biting his teeth to straighten his bent legs, whispering: “It’s as he said—just a spar!”

“Qianshao, what exactly happened?” Wang Yulan turned to Gu Qianshao. Unlike Luo Tian and Pei Letian, her expression showed a hint of gentleness.

“Umm…” Gu Qianshao didn’t know how to answer, puzzled why Luo Tian helped Pei Letian cover up. If she spoke truthfully, it would also involve Luo Tian. She knew her senior sister’s temper well.

“You! You’re like Qingzhu, your soul has been lured away!” Wang Yulan laughed, lightly tapping Gu Qianshao’s head, her face full of indulgence. There was no trace of coldness now.

Wang Yulan’s laugh made the surrounding disciples stunned—how beautiful! For these disciples, they always held reverence for Wang Yulan but had never seen this side of her. Especially Gu Lei, who was stunned into silence after seeing Wang Yulan’s smile.

Luo Tian also blinked, feeling the pressure disappear. He couldn’t understand how this terrifying woman could change her expression so quickly.

“Qingzhu, how long will you hide?” Wang Yulan didn’t wait for people to react and turned stern again, shouting at a stone figure beside her.

“Senior Sister’s cultivation is truly invincible! I hid so secretly, yet you still found me!” Everyone saw another tall figure emerge from behind the stone. He was somewhat awkwardly stepping out.

“Respect Senior Sister Ning!” Everyone, seeing the arrival, was surprised again.

“You still act as a senior sister? Your junior was bullied, yet you watched from the shadows!” Wang Yulan scolded and poked Ning Qingzhu’s head.

“Senior Sister, can you stop tapping our heads? It’s annoying!” Ning Qingzhu muttered lowly, stepping toward Wang Yulan.

Wang Yulan, Ning Qingzhu, and Gu Qianshao formed a beautiful scene among the crowd, making the male disciples of Wood Peak gape.

Luo Tian blinked but quickly regained his composure, waking up Gu Lei.

“You dare to say that? You didn’t stop it when it happened, just watched with interest! Didn’t you know the consequences of their martial arts colliding?” Thinking about the previous confrontation, Wang Yulan tapped Ning Qingzhu’s head again,不满 (displeased).

“If they hurt others, it's okay. But if they hurt Qianshao, how would your master deal with you?” Wang Yulan didn’t let Ning Qingzhu respond and continued.

Hearing Wang Yulan’s words, Ning Qingzhu pouted but didn’t dare to argue. He just lowered his head without speaking, secretly shocked by their martial arts—though they didn’t harm him, it was hard for ordinary Refining Body disciples to withstand.

Other onlookers had twitching mouths, thinking: “What does it mean by ‘hurting others is okay’!”

But due to Wang Yulan’s dominance, they only felt discontent internally without daring to speak out.

“Fellow, you’re not bad,” Wang Yulan slightly praised Luo Tian before turning to Pei Letian.

“Jealousy and petty! Don’t think I don’t know what you did in Greenwood Peak recently. Think your Grand Elder supports you, so you can do as you please?” Wang Yulan’s voice turned cold.

“Junior has repented!” Pei Letian, though proud, had to lower his head before Wang Yulan and admit his mistake.

“Hmph! Next time I see you bullying a disciple, don’t blame me for not giving Zhang Ziping face!” Wang Yulan coldly said.

“Yes, yes! Senior Sister’s teachings are correct!” At this moment, Pei Letian had no trace of his former arrogance; he was like a well-behaved child.

“Alright, disperse! Go do your own things. You didn’t cultivate properly before, but you were eager to watch!” Wang Yulan shouted at the crowd.

“Yes, Senior Sister! We’ll go cultivate now!” The crowd echoed with voices of going to cultivate, dispersing in a hurry.

“Then I’ll take my leave!” Pei Letian deeply gazed at Luo Tian, leading several disciples to depart.

“Alright, everyone has dispersed. Let’s go! Fellow, next time you dare to run wild in Greenwood Peak, don’t blame me for not giving Zhang Ziping face!” Wang Yulan grabbed Ning Qingzhu and walked up the mountain.

“Senior Sister, good luck!” Ning Qingzhu turned back, giving Gu Qianshao a fist gesture before leaving with Wang Yulan.

As everyone dispersed, Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong also said their goodbyes, following the crowd back to Greenwood Peak. Only Luo Tian, Gu Qianshao, and Gu Lei remained.

Gu Qianshao gently adjusted her hair, smiling at Luo Tian: “How? The great genius of Dan Sect today had time to visit me?”

Though it was a questioning tone, Gu Lei thought it sounded like flirting. He looked at his sister more than once, feeling unnecessary and pouted: “Ah! I’ll go for a walk myself; don’t disturb you two!”

Hearing Gu Lei’s words, Luo Tian and Gu Qianshao both gave him a ‘go away’ look. Gu Lei left sheepishly to wander around Greenwood Peak.

“Let’s go! I’ll show you around Greenwood Peak!” Gu Qianshao looked at her brother leaving and said to Luo Tian.

“Ah! I haven’t really explored Greenwood Peak before; I always came for others’ elixirs, and you were in seclusion. This time, I must take a good look! They say Greenwood Peak is the most beautiful peak in Five Elements Sect. Today I’ll also see it!” Luo Tian smiled.

Hearing Luo Tian had come to Greenwood Peak before and sought her, Gu Qianshao felt a sweet warmth. She led Luo Tian up to the peak’s summit.

Along the way, Luo Tian reached the mountain top with Gu Qianshao amidst the jealous glares of Greenwood Peak male disciples.

The entire Greenwood Peak was covered with lush trees. Luo Tian stood at the summit, gazing at the verdant forest. Gu Qianshao stood in front of him, both resembling a celestial couple. At this moment, it was tranquil.

“Qianshao, I heard some things about your mother!” Luo Tian broke the silence, choosing a heavy topic.

Chapter 76: Gu Lei’s Love Interest ()

Gu Qianshao heard Luo Tian’s words, her body trembled. Her gaze showed confusion as she turned to face Luo Tian, waiting for his next words.

“Remember when I left Tianyuan City, my father asked me to do something—take care of you and Gu Lei!” Luo Tian’s heart conjured the image of that strong man, who had cried in front of him.

“What did your father tell you!” Gu Qianshao could no longer suppress her emotions, grabbing Luo Tian’s robe.

“He didn’t say much else; he just asked me to take care of you and Gu Lei. He said nothing more, only sighed repeatedly. That’s why I want to ask you—do you know anything? I always feel something was wrong with my father!” Luo Tian sighed.

“I only know my mother left when we were very young. My father never told me anything else. He always said, ‘Wait until you reach the Spiritual Soul Realm to tell you.’ But reaching the Spiritual Soul Realm is so difficult!” Gu Qianshao laughed bitterly.

Luo Tian also thought of what Gu Lei had said that night in the inn, sighing: “Qianshao, I promise you. If my strength is enough in the future, I will find your mother and reunite your family!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s vow-like voice, Gu Qianshao looked up at him, seeing clear eyes gazing back. Her face blushed slightly, nodding gently before looking complexly into the distance.

“Roar!” A mournful cry shattered their tranquil scene.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianshao turned, following the sound’s source. When they saw its origin, both felt awkward.

Ning Qingzhu held Gu Lei by the collar, walking while beating him. Each time Ning Qingzhu’s hand fell, Gu Lei cried out, muttering something as he approached Luo Tian and Gu Qianshao.

Luo Tian looked at the scene, puzzled: “Did this kid sneak a peek at Ning Qingzhu bathing?”

The more he thought, the more he believed Gu Lei’s character could do such a thing. But then he dismissed the thought—Ning Qingzhu was so strong, how could Gu Lei succeed?

“Stupid kid! You really dared to flirt with the senior sister! You’re really bold!” As they approached, Luo Tian and Gu Qianshao finally heard Ning Qingzhu’s mutterings.

Hearing Ning Qingzhu’s words, Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly; Gu Qianshao was stunned, her eyes wide and speechless.

As the two were stunned, Ning Qingzhu had already brought Gu Lei to their front.
