It was not that people did not wish to witness the battle in the Ritual Soul Realm; it was simply that they could not discern the fights of the clan leaders clearly. They could only sense powerful fluctuations within the barrier, making it less exhilarating than watching the battles in the Soul Formation Realm.

Luo Wu and Luo Tian's faces bore smiles as they gazed at the crowd behind them: "Did you see? Rest assured, Luo Tian is formidable. His strength surpasses our comprehension—it has become absurd!"

"Wait," someone exclaimed, "he didn't even use his vital energy; it was purely his physical strength!"

"Shh..." A chorus of gasps filled the air.

"Luo Han wins!" As people marveled at Luo Tian's unexpected combat prowess, an elder declared the result of the first match.

"Long Han is mighty!" The young members of Luo Tai's lineage, who were direct descendants, bore ecstatic expressions as they shouted in unison.

Luo Han remained composed as he stepped out of the barrier, his gaze directed toward Luo Tian. He noticed that the battle there had not yet concluded and gave a faint shake of his head.

Luo Xing'an stood among the crowd, observing Luo Han's disdainful expression. He muttered under his breath: "I hope you don't meet your end in a ditch."

Luo Feihong, seemingly spurred by the surrounding astonished glances, wielded his twin axes. He no longer charged toward Luo Tian; their previous clash had revealed that this boy's physical strength was truly absurd.

"Opening Heaven's Triple Axes, first form!" Luo Feihong bellowed, raising his glimmering axe high. His face bore a sinister expression.

As Luo Feihong lifted the axe, a colossal shadow formed in the sky from his vital energy. The sight of it made people tremble involuntarily.

Chapter 548: Opening Heaven's Triple Axes

Chapter 548: Opening Heaven's Triple Axes

"Opening Heaven's Triple Axes—unbelievable, Luo Feihong has already employed it!" The members of Luo Hu's lineage bore expressions of shock.

"Is he trying to end this quickly?" People pondered, but recalling how Luo Feihong had been sent flying by Luo Tian's punch, they felt he had conceded defeat. It was more believable.

A massive axe materialized as Luo Feihong's eyes flashed with coldness. He drove his hands downward, and the axe shadow surged toward Luo Tian with waves of power.

"This axe's might is formidable—most Soul Formation Realm masters would not survive it. But it’s useless against me!" Luo Tian let out a cold snort, his gaze equally icy as he launched a punch.

As people watched Luo Tian confront such an overwhelming axe technique with his bare fists, their mouths twitched in disbelief.

"Is he really using his body to block? How confident must his physique be! After all, this attack rivals a grade one earth-level technique!" People were incredulous.

"Ha! Such minor attacks can't harm Luo Tian," Chen Zhanbiao and Xu Liziye, who had arrived at Luo Qingqing and Luo Wu's side unnoticed, smiled warmly as they gazed at the axe shadow in the sky.

Indeed, as Chen Zhanbiao's words faded, Luo Tian’s fist collided with the axe shadow in the sky.

"Boom..." A deafening explosion erupted, forming a powerful fluctuation before them. Invisible waves of air blew their robes wildly.

The explosion faded, and Luo Tian bore a faint smile. His hand tightly gripped Luo Feihong's axe.

On the other side, Luo Feihong's face bore disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian. He attempted to wrest the axe free but found it immovable.

"Shh..." A chorus of gasps echoed through the crowd. People stared at Luo Tian in astonishment, unable to believe he had achieved such an absurd feat.

Luo Han's initially calm expression slightly contracted, his gaze toward Luo Tian gradually shifting.

"This boy is impressive! He hasn't even used his vital energy, yet he has withstood a grade one earth-level technique purely through his physical strength. Excellent!" Several elders nodded, their faces displaying satisfaction.

The members of Luo Zhan's lineage glowed with excitement as they watched Luo Tian, astonished that he was truly absurd.

"Admit defeat. You are not my match," Luo Tian's lips curled slightly as he delivered a powerful kick to Luo Feihong’s chest.

"Boom..." Luo Feihong's robust body flew backward again, collapsing onto the ground in a pitiful heap. His face flushed crimson.

"Luo Tian!" Luo Feihong gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with madness as he stared at Luo Tian. Especially when he saw Luo Tian's calm gaze, he nearly spat blood.

Luo Tian had not even used his vital energy to defeat him so thoroughly, leaving Luo Feihong deeply resentful.

"Opening Heaven's Triple Axes—third form!" Luo Feihong bellowed, his face contorted with madness. His remaining axe slowly rose toward the sky.

"Third form! It is said that each of Luo Feihong's Opening Heaven’s Triple Axes grows stronger. The first form rivals a grade one earth-level technique, the second form matches a grade two middle-level technique, and the third form equals a grade three high-level technique!" People marveled.

Luo Tian observed the newly formed axe shadow in the sky, his brows furrowing slightly. He then began to rapidly move his hands.

Two massive seals formed swiftly in Luo Tian's hands, merging slowly together.

"Technique fusion!" People gasped as they watched the two techniques gradually merge in Luo Tian's hands.

The elders on the viewing platform also bore expressions of disbelief. They had lived long enough to witness this for the first time.

"Am I dreaming?" The people behind Luo Han exclaimed as they watched the techniques nearly complete their fusion.

"This is interesting!" Luo Han's lips curled slightly.

"Boom..."

A thunderous sound echoed from the sky, drawing people’s attention back to Luo Feihong's axe shadow.

"Die!" Luo Feihong roared, driving his hands downward again. With a crackling sound, the massive axe shadow shattered even the void, leaving countless cracks in its wake before closing again.

"Imperial Seal!" At the same time, Luo Tian's Imperial Seal finally coalesced. He let out a roar and pushed it toward the massive axe shadow in the sky.

"Crack..." As if thunder had split the heavens, a powerful fluctuation shook the barrier, causing it to hum.

"It was neutralized!" Someone marveled as the two techniques consumed each other within the barrier, eventually dissipating into the world.

Luo Feihong's mind trembled. He could not believe his strongest technique had failed to harm Luo Tian at all.

In the next moment, Luo Tian's figure appeared before him. He unleashed a strike with his life-destroying technique, striking Luo Feihong's chest.

The sound of bones breaking echoed. Luo Feihong flew backward once more, this time having been struck with full power. He collapsed onto the ground, coughing up blood and unable to rise.

"Luo Tian wins!" An elder announced Luo Tian's victory.

"Luo Tian!" Luo Wu and Luo Tian shouted in unison, astonished that Luo Tian had defeated Luo Feihong so effortlessly. This victory completely bolstered the confidence of Luo Zhan's lineage, even those who had previously stared blankly now glowed with excitement.

"Excellent."

"You didn’t notice his attributes, did you?" One elder spoke, a tone of admiration in his voice.

Upon hearing the elder's words, the other elders bore expressions of recollection before their faces turned grave with excitement.

"His Five Elements Body! It has returned?" One elder exclaimed in disbelief.

"Yes, the seal was clearly born from the mutual generation of five elements. I never expected this boy to master them so skillfully!" The elder who had spoken continued.

"Indeed, the descendants of Luo Xiong are all prodigies!" The elders nodded, their gazes toward Luo Tian now more satisfied.

"Then let him face Luo Han. I believe it will be quite a spectacle!" The elders smiled, gazing at Luo Tian and Luo Han.

Luo Tian stood in place, a smile on his face. He glanced briefly at Luo Han before nodding toward Luo Qingqing and the others.

"I hope our next encounter will be interesting. I haven’t met such an intriguing opponent in a long time," Luo Han clenched his fists, gazing at Luo Tian with an unyielding battle spirit.

Chapter 549: Battle Against Luo Han

Chapter 549: Battle Against Luo Han

Time slowly passed. About another quarter of an hour later, the first round of Soul Formation Realm battles finally concluded. People's eyes brimmed with anticipation as they gazed at Luo Tian.

No one could have anticipated that Luo Tian had truly defeated Luo Feihong, and it was almost a complete碾压. In people's memories, only Luo Han had achieved such feats.

Even Luo Qingqing and Luo Xing'an would not have managed to defeat Luo Feihong so effortlessly.

After the first round, five young men remained. Besides Luo Tian and Luo Han, there were three others who looked at Luo Tian with confusion.

"Next round! One person will be given a bye, while the other four face each other!" An elder spoke. A moment later, fluctuations reappeared on the five of them, once again appearing in people's sight.

"Rumors..." As people discerned the four combatants, they all bore expressions of astonishment.

Luo Tian and Luo Han locked eyes with each other, appearing in people's sight. The atmosphere exploded instantly.

"Unexpectedly met you again! It must be fate!" Luo Han smiled, gazing at Luo Tian with boundless battle spirit.

"Expected," Luo Tian replied softly, his gaze directed toward the elders seated high above.

"It's fine. If I eliminate you now, it will completely end your lineage’s hopes," Luo Han sighed softly.

"Arrogant fool!" Luo Tian let out a cold snort, his figure like lightning. He had no patience for further words and rushed toward Luo Han.

"Boom..." In an instant, Luo Tian collided with a barrier. His entire body was like a cannonball, rebounded back.

"I didn’t say it had started. Who told you to move?" One elder, with a playful expression, stood up and shouted at Luo Tian.

"Idiot!" The young men of Luo Tai's lineage bore sneers, shouting sarcastically.

"Ugh...damn..." Luo Tian stood up, rubbing his head. He cursed under his breath, gazing at the elders with a melancholic look.

"Start!" As Luo Tian looked toward the elders, that elder's voice echoed from his mouth.

"Kid, don’t be so careless when fighting me. Daydreaming isn’t good!" In an instant, Luo Han's body appeared before Luo Tian and delivered a punch.

"Boom..." Luo Tian was struck directly, flying twenty feet away before stopping.

"Luo Han is mighty!" The people of Luo Han's lineage immediately erupted with endless cheers, their faces filled with disdain as they gazed at Luo Qingqing and the others behind her.

"Who do you think you are to challenge Luo Han?"

"Think defeating Luo Feihong makes you great?"

"Yes, Luo Han is invincible!" Continuous taunts filled the ears of Luo Qingqing and her group, making their faces grim.

"You guys are really idiots. You clearly saw Luo Han's first strike, yet you're proud of it. What are you? Come out and fight me alone. You don’t know what your ancestors didn’t teach you..." Before Luo Qingqing and her group could respond, a loud voice echoed behind them.

Xu Liziye strode forward with an aggressive expression. He gazed at the young men of Luo Tai's lineage but continued to curse, his excitement evident.

"Who are you? Daring to insult us?" The young men of Luo Han's lineage, seeing Xu Liziye’s continuous curses, had no choice but to retaliate. A chorus of taunts erupted.

Xu Liziye, however, had his eyes alight. He cursed more vigorously, as if clashing with a strong opponent. Each curse spilled from his mouth.

The scene momentarily became chaotic. Luo Qingqing and her group stared in disbelief at Xu Liziye, never expecting the seemingly polite Xu Liziye to possess such intensity when cursing. He single-handedly faced a group of people and managed it effortlessly.

On the other hand, after taking a small loss, Luo Tian took Luo Han seriously. Luo Han's strength was beyond his expectations.

An ice, lightning, fire, and wood attribute genius with a Soul Formation Realm peak cultivation. This was enough for Luo Han to face anyone.

But what surprised Luo Tian even more was that Luo Han's physical strength was also formidable. In Luo Tian’s memory, besides Chen Zhanbiao’s physique, Luo Han was certainly the strongest.

The sound of explosions kept echoing between them. As they fought, Luo Han also secretly marveled at Luo Tian's physique, which had exceeded his expectations.

Luo Han knew Luo Tian’s physical strength was strong. He had noticed it during their previous battle with Luo Feihong. However, he himself was confident in his physical strength since only he knew the method of cultivating it.

Luo Han aimed to defeat Luo Tian in every aspect, shattering his confidence. Physical strength was the first choice.

But after a brief battle, Luo Han realized that Luo Tian's physical strength was no less than his own. In fact, it was slightly stronger because his body had already developed some fine cracks.

Thinking of this, Luo Han retreated and struck his hands. Four elemental energies surged from his hands.

"Is he about to use a technique?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly.

Luo Han's hands moved slightly. The four energies soared into the sky, gradually transforming.

"Trumpet..." A roar echoed in the sky. In people's sight, Luo Han’s four elemental energies formed into four massive elephants in the sky.

"Four Elephants Shatter Heaven!" The crowd outside, seeing the four elephants, bore grim expressions. They were clearly familiar with these creatures.

A massive pressure suddenly formed in the sky, and the elephants' roars echoed in people's ears. Even Xu Liziye, who had been engrossed in cursing, was interrupted and stared at the four elephants with a deep gaze.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He could clearly sense the pressure from the elephants, but they couldn’t harm him at all. With his speed, he could easily dodge their seemingly heavy attacks.

However, Luo Han’s next move was somewhat unexpected. In his sight, Luo Han let out a roar and took a deep breath. The elephant formed from the wood attribute energy descended instantly, transforming back into energy and entering Luo Han’s body.

But as Luo Han inhaled, his body emitted a series of crackling sounds. His muscles bulged with veins before calming down.

"Four Elephants Shatter Heaven! One Elephant's Power!" Luo Han let out a low roar, his body vanishing instantly. In the next moment, he appeared before Luo Tian without throwing a punch. His body transformed into the shape of an elephant’s leg, charging toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 550: The First Battle Ends

Chapter 550: The First Battle Ends

Luo Tian hadn’t reacted yet when he heard a thunderous sound. After a trumpet, his entire body flew backward. He felt as if his body was no longer under his control, and a crisp sound echoed from his body.

Bones cracked. Luo Tian lay pitifully on the ground, blood flowing from his lips. His face bore astonishment.

"Strong!" Chen Zhanbiao’s face showed a hint of excitement. He could feel Luo Han's physical strength was formidable, making him eager to try.

"What method is this?" Xu Liziye’s face bore concern as he addressed Luo Qingqing.

"Four Elephants Shatter Heaven. It's a technique formed by elemental energy, creating four ancient demon elephants. Then it uses the power of these demons to enhance one's physical strength, making it absurdly strong!" Luo Qingqing’s face showed a hint of worry as she watched Luo Tian get up.

"This is just one elephant. I remember that in the last grand competition, Luo Han could already connect two elephants’ power. I wonder how many he can now connect!" Before Xu Liziye could continue, Luo Qingqing whispered again.

"Haha! I said Luo Han is invincible!" Seeing Luo Tian’s pitiful state, the young men of Luo Han's lineage shouted again with mockery.

"Rest assured, Luo Tian’s strength is beyond human limits!" Xu Liziye smiled lightly and comforted Luo Qingqing.

Inside the barrier, Luo Tian wiped his lips. The wood attribute quickly healed his body. He bore an interested expression as he gazed at Luo Han and let out a low roar: "Again!"

"Die!" Seeing Luo Tian get up again, Luo Han’s body vanished instantly.

But in the next moment, Luo Tian's figure also vanished.

Then a thunderous collision sound echoed within the barrier. Two figures flew apart like cannonballs.

"Blocked!" Luo Qingqing and others' eyes brightened as they watched Luo Tian retreat again.

"Cough...cough..." Both Luo Tian and Luo Han coughed slightly, their faces pale. Their bodies bore numerous cracks.

Luo Han's eyes showed surprise. Then his body vanished again, drawing one of the three remaining elephants into the sky.

"Two Elephants' Power! I wonder how you’ll withstand it!" After absorbing another elephant, Luo Han's body healed visibly and returned to its original state.

"Ha! Recovery? I am a cultivator of elixirs!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, swallowing three sixth-grade elixirs as if they were worthless. His body recovered quickly.

"Two Elephants' Power! Go!" Luo Han sneered, his speed increasing again. His body vanished instantly.

"Sealing Heaven's Steps, open!" Luo Tian also let out a low roar. His body transformed into a streak of light and rushed toward Luo Han.

Sealing Heaven's Steps was the method Luo Tian thought of to deal with Luo Han. Using Sealing Heaven’s Steps’ terrifying speed, he aimed to solve the problem of Luo Han's powerful physical strength.

Previously, whenever Luo Tian used Sealing Heaven’s Steps, he stood in front of people but had never collided with anyone. Because his speed was too fast; if he collided with someone, that person would suffer heavy injuries. However, Luo Tian himself would also sustain considerable damage. This was a method of injuring oneself to harm the enemy.

"Boom..."

The thunderous sound echoed again from their collision, making the onlookers stunned.

"Three Elephants' Power... Four Elephants’ Power!" Luo Han, as if enraged by a bull, finally used four elephants' power.

With the support of four ancient demon elephants, Luo Han now appeared like a war god. Invisible waves of power radiated from his body. His body emitted the sound as if it would explode.

Luo Tian panted heavily, his eyes showing an indomitable spirit. He didn’t care about any elixirs and placed them in his mouth, wiping the blood from his lips.

"Today I’ll show you the true Four Elephants Shatter Heaven!" Luo Han sneered, his aura overwhelming. He transformed into an ancient demon elephant and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"I don’t believe it! Sealing Heaven’s Six Steps, open!" In the next moment, Luo Tian vanished as well.

"Crack..." It seemed like space had fractured. A gray crack appeared at the collision site, emitting a series of humming sounds.

Both men spat blood simultaneously. Their bodies emitted sounds like firecrackers, flying backward.

"Boom... Boom..." Both men fell pitifully to the ground. For a moment, neither of them got up.

"Alas... this match is a draw," an elder spoke, his face also showing astonishment. As a soul-formation realm powerhouse, the elders could clearly feel how severe their injuries were. If not treated promptly, they might suffer irreversible damage.

People also stared in disbelief at the two men lying on the ground. Their eyes bore reverence. These two had fought so fiercely that they were both injured severely without using any techniques.

"This first match is a draw," an elder stood up and spoke.

"Wait... wait..." A weak voice echoed. Luo Tian's figure slowly rose, his body as if molded by a paper doll. His body was twisted and bent, emitting a green glow. He gazed at the fallen Luo Han.

"Idiot, I have medicine! Haha!" Luo Tian grabbed another handful of elixirs and placed them in his mouth, laughing lightly. However, this smile was quite unpleasant to the people.

"Luo Tian wins!" Seeing Luo Tian rise again, that elder sighed and announced the result.

"It's impossible! How could Luo Han lose!" The disciples of Luo Tai’s lineage bore expressions of shock, gazing at the fallen Luo Han.

"Haha..." The people of Luo Qingqing's lineage laughed heartily, their eyes filled with provocation as they gazed at the young men of Luo Han's lineage who had shouted so loudly before.

Luo Tian smiled bitterly, feeling his body was about to fall apart. He then collapsed back onto the ground.

One of the elders on the viewing platform extended his hands, and green vital energy formed into two long green dragons. These dragons seemed alive as they entered Luo Tian and Luo Han's bodies.

"Boom..." After the wood attribute dragon entered Luo Tian’s body, his body felt a wave of comfort. The power of the elixirs also activated completely with the wood attribute dragon, instantly healing half of Luo Tian’s injuries.

Although Luo Han hadn’t taken any elixirs, his body also emitted a series of sounds. His injuries gradually improved.

At the same time, the other two matches also concluded with results. It turned out that Luo Han had been eliminated from the top four.

Chapter 551: Group Battle

Chapter 551: Group Battle

Upon hearing this result, the people of Luo Tai's lineage felt as if they had eaten a fly. They had thought Luo Han would definitely secure first place, but instead he hadn’t even made it into the top three.

Luo Tian and one of the people who had received a bye, along with another winner, became the top three. Luo Tian's strength was already evident to everyone. Since even Luo Han had been defeated by Luo Tian, it could be said that Luo Tian's first place was solid.

"Haha..." The group behind Luo Qingqing laughed heartily, gazing at Luo Tian with gratitude. For years, their lineage had been discriminated against and humiliated. Many of their clan members were sent to the Ice Extreme Island, doing work that was even worse than that of servants.

Now, Luo Tian had won the grand competition's first place. This was undoubtedly a strong injection of confidence for their lineage. If they won another round, this lineage might even have the chance to reclaim the position of direct island master. How could they not be happy?

The result was indeed as such. After Luo Tian and the other person's injuries were healed, Luo Tian fulfilled expectations and secured first place.

Luo Han tightly clenched his fists, his face dark as he gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly. He felt a sense of frustration; he had been in the advantageous position but lost to Luo Tian's elixirs.

"Luo Han, don’t worry. There’s still a group battle. We’ll show them!"

"Yes, let's show them in the group battle!" The young men of Luo Han’s lineage comforted him.

Hearing their words, Luo Han's dark face slightly eased. He sneered: "I wonder what tricks you have in the group battle!"

Under people's envious glances, Luo Tian descended from the platform and approached Luo Qingqing, who was excited.

Feeling the eyes on him, Luo Tian smiled slightly. After greeting Luo Qingqing, he turned his gaze toward the Ritual Soul Realm battlefield.

For others, the battle in the Ritual Soul Realm might be invisible. But for Luo Tian, who had a budding soul awareness, it was no problem at all.

As his consciousness probed in, Luo Tian's face slightly changed. This was the first time he had witnessed a battle between masters of the Ritual Soul Realm.

"Stunning!" Luo Tian could only use these two words to describe the battle of masters in the Ritual Soul Realm.

Within his consciousness, their speed was at its peak. Each punch carried overwhelming power. Luo Tian felt they seemed to have shattered the heavens, with countless void cracks visible everywhere.

Ten people were masters of the Ritual Soul Realm. Only Luo Zhan had just entered this realm, so his strength was slightly behind. However, it was difficult to determine a winner immediately.

"Group battle, prepare to move forward one step!" Before Luo Tian could continue observing, the elder's voice echoed again in people’s ears.

"So quickly!" Luo Tian was startled but saw that Luo Qingqing and others had naturally taken a step forward.

"Did they change the time within? Or did their battle disrupt time itself? I felt it was fast, but outside had already passed a lot of time. Because Luo Tian knew that the elders had announced it would start one hour later, but now he had only watched for a moment and it was already an hour. This made Luo Tian astonished."

"Ritual Soul Realm, I must enter it. That is truly a powerhouse. The Soul Formation Realm was just the beginning!" Luo Tian's eyes bore determination as he took a step forward.

"Buzz..." The familiar fluctuation came from beneath his feet. Ten people reappeared within the barrier, and on the other side stood ten others.

"Destiny brings us together!" After exchanging glances, both sides felt the same thought.

Luo Feihong's face was dark as he stood at the front, his gaze no longer so hostile toward Luo Tian. After all, even Luo Han had fallen to Luo Tian's hands; he had no reason to be upset.

Luo Tian frowned slightly, gazing at the elders on the platform. He could sense that these elders had done this intentionally.

"Begin!" As Luo Tian gazed at these elders, one of them smiled and spoke, his voice imprinted in everyone's ears.

"I admit you are strong. But I can't imagine how you would win the group battle. Just by relying on those useless people behind you?" Luo Feihong's face bore disdain as he gazed at Luo Tian and those behind him.

Of course, Luo Feihong excluded Luo Qingqing. After all, she was not even his match.

Hearing Luo Feihong's words, the disciples behind Luo Tian and Luo Qingqing turned red with anger. Their eyes bore fury as they gazed at Luo Feihong.

But then they sighed, and indeed, as Luo Feihong said, they were all weak. Except for Luo Tian, Luo Qingqing, Luo Wu, and Luo Zhen, the others were all at the Soul Formation Middle or Early stages. One was even at the Soul Formation Late stage.

This was after Luo Tian had given them elixirs. Without that, they might have been at the Soul Formation Early stage.

Luo Feihong's side was different. Five of them were at the Soul Formation Peak, and five were at the Soul Formation Late stage. They stood neatly, their eyes filled with disdain as they gazed at those behind Luo Tian.

"Group battle emphasizes cooperation. Just do what we discussed before!" Luo Tian turned to the group, his face showing a slight smile as he spoke.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, people felt they had found their leader. Their eyes regained confidence as they nodded to him, regaining their previous self-assurance.

Seeing Luo Tian's single sentence restore the group’s confidence, Luo Qingqing smiled slightly. She marveled at how Luo Tian had such a power to inspire those around him.

"Begin!" The elder's aged voice echoed in people’s ears, making them look expectantly at Luo Tian and Luo Feihong's groups.

As for the other opposing teams, they received no attention at all. Even Luo Han’s group had few spectators. One reason was there was no suspense, and the other was that people had begun to doubt Luo Han's undefeated legend after he had been defeated by Luo Tian.

On the other hand, Luo Tian’s group was not expected to win. However, with Luo Tian's presence, people wanted to see if he would create another miracle under such a disadvantage and defeat Luo Feihong's group.

"Deploy the Ten Directions Ice Array!" As the elder’s words faded, Luo Feihong coldly spoke.

As soon as Luo Feihong's words were spoken, the ten people behind him moved with wind-like speed, surrounding Luo Feihong. Their ice attribute surged toward him.

Chapter 552: One Against Ten

Chapter 552: One Against Ten

Luo Tian noticed that Luo Feihong's group was not disorganized but had formed a formation. He furrowed his brows slightly and exchanged glances with Luo Qingqing before nodding slightly.

"Are you really going to do this?" Luo Qingqing's face bore concern. Her consciousness formed into a voice that entered Luo Tian’s mind.

"There's no choice. Our people are still weak. If we use the formation now, then when facing Luo Han's group, we would have no more secrets!" Luo Tian replied.

"Good. But if you can't hold out, return. We don’t need first place!" Luo Qingqing spoke seriously.

"Can't do without first place!" Luo Tian sighed in his heart, but his eyes bore determination. He nodded slightly.

"Buzz..." The fierce ice attribute rapidly coalesced, making Luo Feihong feel as if he would explode. However, his face bore joy. He could sense that his strength had increased several times over. An ordinary Soul Formation Peak master couldn’t withstand even his casual finger.

"Fall back!" Luo Qingqing shouted at Luo Wu and others.

But Luo Wu and others seemed to have anticipated this. Their faces bore concern, and they retreated backward.

"What's going on? Why are they retreating? Are they giving up?" People watching saw Luo Qingqing's group’s actions and bore confusion.

"Something is wrong. One person didn’t retreat!"

"Luo Tian!"

"Does he want to..." People stared at Luo Tian standing proudly, their faces showing disbelief. They guessed what Luo Tian intended but shook their heads, dismissing the thought as too absurd to be possible.

"Ah?" Luo Feihong also bore confusion. His body's power grew stronger, and he looked at the lone Luo Tian, unsure what Luo Tian intended.

"Kid, what do you mean? Are you trying to fight all ten of us alone?" Luo Feihong's face bore mockery as he asked loudly.

"You're smart. I am!" Luo Tian shrugged and replied.

"Arrogant!" As soon as Luo Tian's words were spoken, Luo Feihong and his group bore anger. Especially Luo Feihong’s face was dark as if it would drip water.

Previously, Luo Tian had defeated him without using his vital energy. That had already made Luo Feihong feel frustrated and humiliated. Later, after losing to Luo Han, his mood had improved slightly. Now, he wanted to face ten people alone with just one person. How could Luo Feihong bear such humiliation?

The outside crowd also looked at Luo Tian with amazement, surprised that he had planned to fight one against ten.

"Alright, alright. Don’t be amazed. Start!" Luo Tian bore an impatient expression and rushed toward Luo Feihong's group.

"Today you will pay for your arrogance!" Luo Feihong, with a cold face, pointed his finger.

A dragon of ice formed instantly under Luo Feihong's seemingly casual gesture. It roared toward Luo Tian.

As he ran, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He could clearly sense that after the formation's support, Luo Feihong had become terrifyingly strong. His current strength was absolutely no match for his own, and maybe even stronger. If he was careless, he would pay a heavy price.

"Strong! A casual attack is this powerful. How strong will he be if he unleashes his full strength!" The Luo family members marveled, gazing at Luo Feihong who looked like an emperor of ice.

"It seems I must reveal my full strength!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He took up his spear, and a golden dragon coalesced instantly. The five elements generated each other, breaking through stone.

"Third form: Golden Sea Sifting Sand!" Luo Tian simultaneously unleashed the third form of his spear. A golden spear shadow formed into a wave of gold, rushing toward Luo Feihong and his group.
