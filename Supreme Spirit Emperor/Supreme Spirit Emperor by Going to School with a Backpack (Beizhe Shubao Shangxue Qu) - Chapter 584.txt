Under the process of deduction, Luo Tian's heart was filled with immense shock. As soon as he began to deduce the great flow of heaven and earth, he felt the overwhelming power of the cosmic order, leaving him feeling incredibly small.

“Hmph, this insight is quite remarkable!” Buxian Stone felt admiration as Luo Tian began to deduce the great flow of heaven and earth. However, Buxian Stone did not interrupt Luo Tian but let him continue his deductions while guiding him deeper into the cave. Time passed slowly, and after a quarter of an hour, Luo Tian's face suddenly turned pale, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

“What did you deduce?” Buxian Stone's playful voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, causing him to wear a bitter smile.

“Small... I saw the heavens, I glimpsed the vast world of myriad things! All beings under heaven and earth are but ants before the cosmos!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice laced with awe.

“Stop deducing recklessly; if you continue, you might end up killing yourself!” Buxian Stone scolded Luo Tian. Deduction of the cosmic order was a practice reserved for those who had entered the realm of Immortal Kings, and Luo Tian's timing was premature.

“Still, your ability to sense the terrifying nature of the cosmic order is commendable!” Buxian Stone's voice carried a hint of disdain.

“I refuse to believe it!”

“Back when the Dao suppressed me, I almost died; I never forget a grudge!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, beginning his deductions again.

“Still not giving up…” Buxian Stone observed Luo Tian's renewed efforts, scoffing slightly as he watched closely.

“Pf….” Blood spewed from Luo Tian's mouth repeatedly, each time revealing a flicker of confusion in his eyes. Upon closer inspection, his eyes were filled with the laws of the Dao.

As time passed, the frequency of Luo Tian's blood spitting lessened, and his body exuded an eerie aura that sent shivers down the spine—though he himself remained unaware.

“Did you truly grasp something?” Buxian Stone sensed Luo Tian's transformation, his mind astounded. On the crimson earth, waves of Daoic laws began to ripple, intertwining with the principles of existence and settling upon Luo Tian's form.

Time passed swiftly; three days vanished in the blink of an eye. Luo Tian’s legs finally recovered, and he slowly rose to his feet, his eyes alight with joy.

“Fate plays tricks! But I believe that human determination can overcome fate!” Luo Tian declared aloud, his voice resolute. His hands moved fluidly, transmitting the Daoic laws through them. As the laws flowed from his grasp, the cave trembled violently, and thick black mist poured forth from the walls, converging toward Luo Tian.

“This is a subterranean vein!” Buxian Stone exclaimed, sensing the black mist rushing toward him and being absorbed into Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's hand seals shifted rapidly, his aura rising not through cultivation but through an intrinsic elevation. His intangible aura gradually solidified into a tangible presence.

“Is this a domain? Yet it doesn’t resemble one!” Buxian Stone was genuinely stunned, sensing Luo Tian’s strength had grown significantly within this tangible aura.

“Though it falls short of a domain, it is still an extraordinary technique. With this, the boy’s future ascension to Immortal King will be swift,” Buxian Stone mused, astonished that Luo Tian had deduced such a method from the cosmic order.

“I shall name this technique ‘Heaven-World Dao Method!’” Luo Tian leapt into the air, breaking free from Buxian Stone and appearing within the cave. The very momentum of heaven and earth, which had been pressing down upon him, now clashed against his aura.

“Crack….” An invisible aura radiated from Luo Tian, solidifying into a tangible force that opposed the overwhelming cosmic order. The sound of cracking echoed repeatedly.

Within a hundred zhang, Luo Tian’s aura enveloped the space, clashing against the crushing cosmic order. The distance narrowed gradually until it reached fifty zhang, yet Luo Tian’s aura grew denser with each contraction.

“Go…” Luo Tian wore a faint smile, finally locating Buxian Stone’s presence. As the owner of Buxian Stone, he now perceived every movement within fifty zhang without fail.

Chapter 2218: The Chessboard (The Game)

"Congratulations, Master. You have cultivated an unparalleled Daoic method. With this, you shall be unmatched among Immortals below the King’s realm—perhaps even capable of challenging those who have yet to master a domain!" Buxian Stone’s flattery echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, though it was exaggerated. Yet Buxian Stone knew that at present, Luo Tian faced few rivals among True Immortals.

Now that he could see Buxian Stone, there was no escape from Luo Tian’s grasp. Thus, Buxian Stone decided to tread carefully; after all, Luo Tian's restrictions were excruciatingly painful.

"Finally found you, you bastard!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and Buxian Stone appeared in it.

"A true man should be adaptable!" Buxian Stone consoled himself, allowing Luo Tian to seize him.

"Let’s go…" Luo Tian spoke softly, his form flickering as he reappeared on Buxian Stone. Within fifty zhang, there was no need for Buxian Stone to emit signals; Luo Tian could now land on Buxian Stone himself.

"If I encounter the Demon Lord again, I have an 80% chance of defeating him!" Luo Tian mused, as Buxian Stone guided them deeper into the cave.

At the same time, all those who had arrived at Demon Mountain—True Immortals of mid-level and above—were traversing the cave, burdened by the cosmic order’s pressure. They advanced painstakingly toward its depths, a journey that would take them far longer than Luo Tian’s. Yet none despaired; they saw this as an opportunity. Though the pressure was immense, it solidified their cultivation and benefited their future ascension to Immortal King. Especially for the eight Grand Commanders, who had reached the peak of True Immortals and were on the brink of becoming Half-Immortal Kings, this trial was invaluable.

Time passed as Buxian Stone drifted for half a day before finally reaching the cave’s depths and exiting.

A towering black mountain emerged in Luo Tian’s vision, its surroundings brimming with golden-black energy. The entire mountain exuded an aura of authority.

Black mist coiled around the peak, interwoven with ethereal qi. The contrast of black and gold was like fire and water, obscuring any view of what lay atop.

“You’ve come…” A weathered voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, jolting him. This voice had always been present within his thoughts; now it felt clearer, confirming its origin.

“Come… I’ve been waiting for you…” The same weathered voice persisted, instilling a sense of foreboding in Luo Tian. He hesitated whether to ascend the mountain.

The peak was not tall—merely tens of thousands of zhang—but reaching its summit felt insurmountable.

“Ascend, little… no—Master. If you subdue this mountain, I believe my strength will recover somewhat. Then, you can use me to strike down others!”

“Even if you cannot subdue it, we two should be able to escape…” Buxian Stone spoke, but Luo Tian detected a hint of trepidation in his voice.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian felt Buxian Stone was a trap, and being with him had never brought peace.

Yet recalling his own strength and Buxian Stone’s abilities, Luo Tian bit his lip and stepped into the black mist.

“Roar…” As soon as he entered, a cacophony of roars filled his ears. The mist surrounding the mountain surged violently, coalescing into countless ghostly figures that rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, striking out with a single palm that shattered a ghostly entity equivalent to a True Immortal’s early stage.

“You told me to come, yet now you hinder me—what is your intention?” Luo Tian shouted, his voice laced with disdain.

Yet the voice ignored him, repeating its words without pause.

Thousands of ghosts coalesced, but instead of attacking Luo Tian, another force surged—golden ethereal qi. It condensed into armored soldiers brandishing lances, charging toward the ghosts.

The battlefield roared as Luo Tian observed the clash between soldiers and ghosts, his mind puzzled but uninterested. He approached the mountain’s base, stepping onto a stone path flanked by ruins. Scanning with his spiritual sense, he found no remarkable spots.

“I’ll see how long you continue to play tricks!” Luo Tian sneered, marching toward the summit.

Though there was pressure, his use of the Heaven-World Dao Method rendered it harmless. His steps were swift as wind, ascending rapidly toward the peak.

“Ten zhang… a thousand zhang… ten thousand zhang…” After an hour, Luo Tian was within a thousand zhang of the summit. His eyes could now discern details atop the peak.

A shadow stood upon it, hands clasped behind its back, radiating a formidable aura that halted Luo Tian. He gazed at the shadow with solemnity.

Luo Tian noticed he was once again shrouded in mist, unable to see beyond the summit. The shadow’s front revealed a chessboard with black and white pieces. Occasionally, the shadow shifted a black piece, while golden pieces moved autonomously.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow but pressed on toward the summit. However, as he ascended each step, a black piece on the board moved forward. The shadow remained facing away, as if unaware of his presence.

“Who is he playing against? And who is that person?” Luo Tian’s mind tensed, halting his advance. He felt an instinctual fear that if he continued, the black pieces would lose.

“Come quickly… I’ve been waiting for you…” The voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“This old man is terrifying!” As Luo Tian pondered, Buxian Stone’s voice echoed in his mind.

“This old man is not human; he is merely a projection…”

“He is playing against the Dao itself, using heaven and earth as the board and all beings as pieces…”

“This old man must be a supreme power, even transcending the Dao!” Buxian Stone’s voice trembled.

“You may not yet comprehend it, but this old man once dwelled here. The ghosts and golden soldiers you saw earlier are the pieces—everything here is an illusion!” Buxian Stone, usually fearless, now conveyed infinite fear.

“How can that be?” Luo Tian’s mind surged with waves of disbelief. If everything were an illusion, he would sense it.

Yet from the beginning, Luo Tian felt this place was real—every natural illusion included.

“This old man is a match for my former master, perhaps even surpassing him! Hurry, we cannot stay here; even the Black and White Judges of the Wheel Turning Hall might be trapped!”

“Though it is a projection, it is enough to halt an Immortal King at its peak!” Buxian Stone urged Luo Tian, causing him to curse.

“I said I wouldn’t come, but you forced me! You bastard!” Luo Tian cursed Buxian Stone, berating him thoroughly.

“Deep down, it was your greed for this place’s opportunity that brought you here…” Buxian Stone mused internally but dared not retaliate.

“Come quickly…” As Luo Tian grumbled, the voice echoed again, making his lips twitch.

“I’m damned if I go or stay!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, but then noticed the shadow placing another black piece.

As the shadow moved, Luo Tian felt his legs no longer obeying him, advancing toward the summit involuntarily.

“Stop this!” Luo Tian roared in his mind, realizing he had entered the chessboard. His body was no longer under his control.

“Divine battles—don’t involve me!” Luo Tian cried, and suddenly the scene shifted. The vast heavens transformed; he donned black armor, wielded Longyuan Sword, and was flanked by countless soldiers, evading attacks.

“Damn it! I’ve been ensnared in the chessboard! If I don’t break free, I might be sacrificed!” Buxian Stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, nearly making him weep.

“Damn it—how do I break this?” Luo Tian cursed, as golden soldiers surrounded him and his troops.

“Buzz…” Longyuan Sword radiated immense power, unleashing a cataclysmic wave. Luo Tian watched himself from another perspective, slaying the golden soldiers.

At this moment, he felt astonishingly powerful; Longyuan Sword’s strength was incomprehensibly greater than when he wielded it himself.

After a fierce battle, Luo Tian’s troops were reduced to few, yet they broke through the encirclement.

“Almost died… almost!” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at his remaining soldiers.

“I must escape this chessboard! If I don’t, I might be sacrificed next!” Luo Tian seethed, furious at the feeling of being controlled.

As he pondered how to break free, the shadow moved another black piece. Simultaneously, Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and others appeared at the mountain’s base.

“What happened? I was pushing through pressure before, but now I’m here!” Everyone was puzzled, then spotted Luo Tian atop the summit.

Chapter 2219: The Chess Piece

Everyone was stunned, but upon seeing Luo Tian atop the summit, their expressions turned shocked.

“This summit must hold a great opportunity; we must hurry before this boy claims it alone!” Tianfu and others exchanged glances, rushing toward the summit.

“Strange… why isn’t Xiao Tian ascend? He keeps moving along these steps?” Zhang Ziping furrowed his brow, but merely puzzled. Concerned for Luo Tian’s safety, he and Lei Yong and Ji Chen ascended the summit.

Though Tianfu and others were disciples of Buxian City, they would still vie for the opportunity. Just like before in the Cemetery King’s Palace, Tianfu and his allies had fought fiercely.

“Buzz…” As Zhang Ziping stepped onto the first stair, he regretted it immediately; he was stunned to find himself no longer under his control, moving forward rapidly past Tianfu and others who had ascended earlier.

“Damn it…” The surrounding scene surged, an irresistible force acting upon Zhang Ziping. He hadn’t reacted in time and was drawn into the chessboard, just like Luo Tian.

“Senior Brother…” Luo Tian had carved a path and met Zhang Ziping, who had just entered the chessboard.

“Even they have entered…” Luo Tian sighed bitterly, and Zhang Ziping saw him, his expression equally despondent. Neither spoke; they were now pieces on the board and could not communicate.

“Greed led us astray; this place was beyond our reach…” Zhang Ziping cursed himself, believing his half-Immortal King status would protect Luo Tian. Yet he had led them into a trap. If they had left after defeating the Demon Lord, they might have escaped. Now it was too late; they were ensnared in the chessboard, powerless to resist.

Tianfu and others saw Zhang Ziping rushing forward without surprise; after all, Zhang Ziping was a half-Immortal King and stronger than them. However, as time passed, one hundred people noticed something terrifying: after walking, they could no longer see the steps behind them, only moving forward.

“Something’s wrong! Definitely something’s wrong!” As they walked, they saw the shadow atop the summit and felt its power. They realized Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping might have been ensnared. Now, they wanted to retreat but found no path—feeling that descending the stairs would plunge them into an abyss.

“This isn’t opportunity—it’s a death trap!” They shouted in alarm. As time passed, the shadow continued placing pieces; Tianfu and Lei Yong gradually lost control, becoming pieces. Their hearts trembled.

“Thirty-plus have already fallen…” Those still standing gazed in awe at the shadow, fear etched on their faces. They didn’t know what awaited them next.

“Boom…” As the crowd watched, a True Immortal mid-level disciple was instantly turned into blood mist, vanishing from sight.

“Dead… dead!” They trembled; they hadn’t expected such a quick death. The deceased was one of the youths beside Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, having witnessed the youth’s death—cut down by a single strike. He had been so close to being the next victim.

“Senior Brother, Uncle… please be careful not to place the wrong piece!” Luo Tian prayed fervently, hoping Zhang Ziping and Lei Yong would be safe.

“Cursing won’t help; I must find a way to break this!” But soon, Luo Tian’s mind cleared. He knew he couldn’t entrust his life to others.

“Everything is an illusion; I must break free!” Luo Tian roared mentally, brainstorming solutions. With his current strength, he knew escape was impossible.

“Epoch Book!” After a moment’s thought, Luo Tian suddenly recalled the Epoch Book, rarely used but never failed.

“Buzz…” Thinking of it, he attempted to summon the Epoch Book. To his surprise, it responded with a tremor.

Golden light radiated from Luo Tian’s body, and as the Epoch Book’s waves spread, the shadow ceased placing pieces. The illusory board trembled; one piece began to waver.

“What’s happening!” Seeing the board tremble, people gasped again.

“It’s Luo Tian! What is this golden light on him? Why does it make me feel oppressed!” They stared in horror, noticing Luo Tian’s entire body glowing with golden light.

As the gold spread, the board trembled more violently. Finally, a piece broke free from the illusory board, streaking like a meteor and changing its color from black to gold.

“Crash…” As the golden piece broke free, the illusory board collapsed with a thunderous roar.

“Alas…” A long sigh echoed in their ears, though it was only one sound, it resonated like a divine voice, imbued with ultimate Dao.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound rose as the board shattered. Luo Tian and others instantly regained their senses, while the shadow vanished from sight.

“Epoch Book, you are truly a master!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with excitement; he hadn’t expected to escape.

The massive mountain began to collapse, black mist swirling upward. The path they had taken finally appeared, and the battling ghosts and golden soldiers shattered into a storm, sweeping across eight directions.

“Terrifying…” They hurried down the mountain. Halfway down, serpents of black mist burst from cave mouths across the mountains, rushing toward the crumbling peak.

“This is the aura of subterranean veins!”

“Did we break through here, and this is our reward?” Everyone’s eyes gleamed with excitement as they watched the rushing subterranean veins.

The澎湃 serpents were denser and stronger than those controlled by the Demon Lord, surpassing them by several times—terrifying.

“If I could absorb these hundred subterranean veins, I’d surely reach Half-Immortal King status—perhaps even challenge an Immortal King!” Tianfu and others’ eyes gleamed with awe.

“Whoever absorbs more wins!” Tianfu’s group wore excited expressions; subterranean veins could be absorbed by both hellish and heavenly disciples, so they wouldn’t let Luo Tian monopolize them.

Tianfu and others extended their hands, summoning the ghostly veins. The hundred subterranean veins varied in density and rarity.

The hundred veins were quickly divided among the group, each receiving one to absorb. The thickest vein naturally fell to Luo Tian. None spoke against it, as they guessed that escaping the chessboard was linked to Luo Tian.

“Awesome!” Black serpents descended, and within Luo Tian’s eight ghostly veins, ghostly energy surged. The澎湃 energy transformed into True Immortal power, absorbed by the figure in his dantian.

Each of the hundred people’s eyes gleamed with excitement; this opportunity was neither small nor large, but for those on the brink of breakthroughs, it was more than enough.

“Crack…” Tianfu’s face lit with excitement as his body emitted a crackling sound. He devoured the powerful subterranean vein, and his aura surged violently.

“Haha…” Tianfu couldn’t help but laugh aloud, his aura rising to Half-Immortal King status—like a divine being descending with overwhelming power.

“Half-Immortal King!” Seeing Tianfu’s ascension, others wore expressions of envy but also excitement. Though they hadn’t reached Half-Immortal King, their strength had significantly improved.

Time passed as breakthroughs echoed, but the Grand Commanders hadn’t surpassed Half-Immortal King.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, a smile on his face. He could sense his cultivation was nearly complete, heralding the prelude to True Immortal Peak.

What startled Luo Tian was a surge of golden light in his dantian, its source the figure’s third eye.

“Chess piece!” Luo Tian almost gasped aloud, instantly recognizing the golden piece on the third eye.

“This is an entity of my level, but it’s not as strong as me!” Buxian Stone spoke cautiously; he couldn’t identify the material of this piece.

“This place’s transformation must be due to this piece, buried underground over time, forming subterranean veins and even recreating past scenes!”

“That old man is definitely a terrifying figure. This piece must be an attack method—whether to keep or discard, it’s your choice!” Buxian Stone advised Luo Tian, his voice unusually solemn.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow; he could sense this piece was powerful. Keeping it would be a major weapon, complementing Buxian Stone to subdue many.

But keeping it would inevitably tie him to the old man’s fate—whether this was good or bad, Luo Tian wasn’t sure.

“Find a secluded spot to discard it!” Luo Tian mused, sighing deeply. As the board and mountain collapsed, the calling voice finally vanished. Luo Tian and others saw the battlefield’s dark sky again.

“Luo Tian, this time it was thanks to you! If not for you, we might have been erased by that strange chessboard!” Tianfu laughed, his voice filled with excitement. Among these people, who was most delighted? Obviously Tianfu.

Chapter 2220: Delivery

The group didn’t linger at Demon Mountain, now reduced to flat ground. As they appeared, the disciples of Buxian City awaiting them were stunned.

“Everyone has grown stronger!” People gasped, gazing at Luo Tian and others with envy.

“Grand Commander Tianfu has ascended to Half-Immortal King!” The crowd erupted in chaos, watching the triumphant Tianfu.

“Thank you all for your help; let’s hurry back!” Luo Tian quickly spoke, fearing another incident. If they faced another chessboard and were all trapped, returning to Buxian City would mean柯断山 would skin him alive.

“Good!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the group excitedly rose into the sky, flying toward Buxian City.

The return journey had no surprises, but Luo Tian once again sat in the silver carriage, his face showing weakness as if severely wounded.

“Senior Brother, I have a project worth over ten million battle merits—interested?” On the journey back, Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with light, addressing Lei Yong with a smile.

Upon hearing this, Lei Yong’s eyes sparkled with the glint of a shrewd merchant. He licked his lips but spoke seriously: “Tell me more; if it’s feasible, I’ll invest!”

“Little Brother now owes a lot of debts. This trip to Demon Mountain, you know I’m in deep debt—I need to earn battle merits to pay it off!” Luo Tian sighed, expressing gratitude. This expedition of ten thousand people had cost him dearly; his current assets couldn’t cover it, and he’d likely be busy crafting Ghost-Repelling Pills for the next year to repay.

Thus, Luo Tian sought every means to gain battle merits, and this plan had only occurred to him after leaving. He trusted that with Lei Yong’s shrewdness, it would double their gains.

Throughout the journey, the two brothers exchanged furtive glances, sparking curiosity among others—yet some felt doomed.

A day passed; ten thousand people returned to Buxian City, their arrival causing a stir.

“My heavens! Two Half-Immortal Kings!” Luo Tian’s return drew attention, faces filled with shock.

“Eighth Army, Xue Mian and Tianfu have become Half-Immortal King masters?” People soon recognized that most of Luo Tian’s group hailed from the Eighth Army.

“Xue Mian Grand Commander, previously said to be dying and challenged by others—was it because his younger brother Luo Tian returned that he survived? How did he become a Half-Immortal King so quickly?” People were stunned, their expressions filled with disbelief.

“Haha! Buxian City, I’ve returned!” Ye Liangchen resumed his arrogant demeanor, laughing. This opportunity to show off was one he wouldn’t miss.

“Grand Commander Luo Tian, his legs still haven’t recovered!” However, the crowd ignored Ye Liangchen’s show-off and focused on Luo Tian, seeing him still seated in the carriage, their minds shaken.

“Grand Commander Luo Tian, we’ll take our leave!” Ten thousand people addressed Luo Tian, their voices filled with anticipation.

This trip to Demon Mountain had yielded rewards for all who survived—killing over seventy thousand, and Ghost-Repelling Pills were no small number.

“Rest assured, I’ve tallied the numbers; once I finish crafting them, I’ll deliver them to you!” Luo Tian smiled, reiterating his promise. Even if he wanted to flee, he couldn’t escape.

“Back!” Zhang Ziping wore a faint smile before leading Luo Tian and Lei Yong into the Eighth Army. Upon entering, they caused a stir.

Under the gaze of the Eighth Army’s disciples, Luo Tian began to craft pills.

As everyone returned, Lei Yong immediately left with Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen, their expressions sly.

“Grand Commander Luo Tian’s legs won’t recover; he was severely wounded in Demon Mountain, suffering an incurable injury!” The next day, the Eighth Army spread this news.

The rumor spread rapidly, like a storm across the entire Eighth Army, leaving people stunned. This news was naturally spread by Lei Yong, Ye Liangchen, and Ye Chen to incite challenges against Luo Tian.

This was the method Luo Tian had thought of to quickly accumulate merits—each thousand-commander challenge required five million battle merits. With several thousand-commanders challenging Luo Tian, it would be a substantial sum to ease his pressure.

However, despite the rumor’s fervor, no one dared challenge Luo Tian. After all, everyone remembered how he had once slain a thousand-commander with a single strike.

Additionally, Zhang Ziping had ascended to Half-Immortal King but was under watchful eyes—his younger brother, compared to Luo Tian, people feared Xue Mian more.

The next day after returning, Zhang Ziping and Tianfu were summoned to the city lord’s mansion. Both had ascended to Half-Immortal King, qualifying to establish two new armies. Yet there were no enough people; with their strength, they didn’t need to be Grand Commanders.

Luo Tian spent these days crafting Ghost-Repelling Pills day and night, yet he hadn’t delivered them.

It wasn’t until the third day of their return that Zhang Ziping and Tianfu returned from the city lord’s mansion. They appeared in the inner courtyard.

“I’ve decided to go to Buxian Mountain!” Zhang Ziping immediately summoned Luo Tian, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen upon his return.

“Senior Brother, aren’t you coming with us?” Lei Yong was puzzled; he didn’t understand why Zhang Ziping would go to Buxian Mountain.

“I’ll scout ahead first!”

“You three are no longer beneath my level; I don’t worry about your safety.”

“Upon reaching Half-Immortal King, you must return to Buxian Mountain and become a senior disciple. This is the rule—unless like General Ko Duan Shan, you become a general and stay in Buxian City.”

“You will eventually return; thus, I’ll pave the way for you!” Zhang Ziping spoke to Luo Tian and others, enlightening them.

“Alright, I’ll leave tomorrow; Tianfu will accompany me to Buxian Mountain and become a senior disciple of the inner sect. If you reach True Immortal Peak, you may also choose to return to Buxian Mountain and become an outer sect disciple!” Zhang Ziping spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian and others with a gentle expression.

“Hmph, Senior Brother, take care!” Luo Tian and the others didn’t say much; after years as brothers, they understood Zhang Ziping’s every action had its reasons.

The four brothers spent the night in deep conversation, a rare occurrence after years of separation. Zhang Ziping and others had long guarded Tianyuan Continent, while Luo Tian had fought in the star fields. Each return was brief.

The next day, Tianfu’s figure appeared outside Luo Tian’s courtyard, his eyes filled with admiration. He glanced at the entire Eighth Army.

Tianfu was a veteran of the Eighth Army, having guarded it for over fifty years—long enough to be considered one of its longest-serving Grand Commanders.

Luo Tian and the others stepped out, meeting Tianfu waiting for them. Since both Zhang Ziping and Tianfu were returning to Buxian Mountain, they naturally traveled together. As the saying goes, those who studied together and fought together share true friendship. Though Zhang Ziping and Tianfu had some friction in the Eighth Army, they would be allies upon reaching Buxian Mountain.

“Luo Tian Brother, I owe you for helping me ascend to Half-Immortal King. Consider my payment done! Also, I have a request for Luo Tian Brother!”

Tianfu wore a smile as he addressed Luo Tian. Previously, he had called Luo Tian “boy,” but now his tone changed—Demon Mountain’s journey had placed Luo Tian on equal footing with him. Without Luo Tian, those who became pieces might have been killed in greater numbers.

“Senior Brother, please speak plainly; I will do my utmost!” Luo Tian clasped his fists.

“I have ten thousand-commanders, three hundred hundred-commanders, and thirty thousand squad leaders and regular soldiers—these are all brothers who have followed me through life and death!”

“I’ll leave after this, but they won’t fare well in the camp. I hope Luo Tian Brother can take them under your care for a while!” Tianfu spoke softly, his heart heavy. The most he feared were those who had followed him through life and death.

“Senior Brother, as long as they don’t despise me, I Luo Tian will never betray your trust!” Luo Tian’s expression slightly shifted; he knew Tianfu was seeking a protector for his men.

“Hmph, with your words, I’m at ease. Thank you, Luo Tian Brother!”

“If you ever go to Buxian Mountain, I’ll repay you generously!” Tianfu spoke. After Zhang Ziping and himself left, a Grand Commander position would be vacant—others were entrenched, but Luo Tian’s new status made him the ideal choice.

Zhang Ziping had previously been a Grand Commander but was independent, with only several thousand-commanders following him—not large in number.

“Blow….” As they spoke, the assembly horn sounded within the Eighth Army, and soldiers’ faces turned solemn.

“This is a farewell signal!” The Eighth Army’s people understood immediately, rushing toward the camp’s center.
