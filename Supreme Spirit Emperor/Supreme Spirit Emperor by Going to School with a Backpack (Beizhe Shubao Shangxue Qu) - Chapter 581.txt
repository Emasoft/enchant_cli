“Are you serious?” Xue Zishan's face bore a mocking expression as his gaze fell upon Luo Tian. Back then, he had intended to strike at Luo Tian, but it was Xue Mian who had intervened.

“Hum…” The response to Xue Zishan was the rising barrier. The emergence of the barrier signified that the challenge had been accepted.

“Very well, since you've chosen to challenge me, I shall grant your wish. It's time to震慑 those with ill intentions!” Xue Zilong let out a cold laugh, brandishing his sword and stepping into the barrier. Luo Tian, meanwhile, took a slow step forward toward Xue Mian and placed a jade vial before Zhang Ziping: “Your sister-in-law is the Mother of the River of Flowers. I've taken a drop of her essence—let's test it!”

“Hmph, there shouldn't be much trouble. We've prepared plenty over the years—only missing the Mother of the River of Flowers,” Zhang Ziping said with a smile beneath his mask, accepting the vial. Seeing Luo Tian return had already satisfied Zhang Ziping; he was also confident in Luo Tian's strength, having anticipated it.

“Leave it to you!” Zhang Ziping whispered softly. Luo Tian had never failed him before. Even when the Earthly King's Palace exploded, Zhang Ziping hadn't believed Luo Tian was dead. For years, he had waited for Luo Tian's return.

“Rest easy,” Luo Tian chuckled lightly, guiding Zhang Ziping into the house. He then stepped into the barrier, his gaze locking onto Xue Zilong.

“This is my house. Everything here belongs to me. What right do you have to let him enter my home?” Xue Zilong roared.

“Soon it won’t be yours anymore. I’ll reclaim everything!”

“Back then, you wanted to strike me down. Later, for unknown reasons, you left. It's time to settle the score—after all, I do hold a grudge,” Luo Tian said, removing his crimson sword and fixing Xue Zilong with a piercing gaze.

“Still so reckless, young man. Back then you were arrogant too. But with Xue Mian backing you, I didn’t act. Now your patron has fallen—what right do you have to be so bold?” Xue Zilong sneered, his body flashing forward as he lunged at Luo Tian.

“Hum…” Luo Tian's face bore a solemn expression. He gripped the Dragon Abyss Sword without fear, raising his hand and slashing into the void.

“Crack!” As the Dragon Abyss Sword danced, a collision sound echoed in people's ears. The purple sword clashed with the crimson blade.

Step by step, Luo Tian was forced back, while Xue Zilong's body flew backward, his feet leaving cracks in the ground.

“Blocked!” People’s faces showed surprise. Though Xue Zilong had only delivered one strike, he had already exhausted himself in a battle with Zhang Ziping. Yet Xue Zilong was at the peak of True Immortal, a step above Luo Tian. Though it was only one step, it felt like an abyss. The peak of True Immortal meant the ultimate limit—no ordinary late-stage True Immortal could match it.

“Talent! Luo Tian was always a prodigy, capable of fighting beyond his rank!” People soon learned about Luo Tian's past.

“Excellent. No wonder you're Xue Mian’s junior!” Xue Zilong leapt into the air again, rushing toward Luo Tian with his purple sword radiating a thousand feet of brilliance, slicing through the void.

“Hum…” A black dragon burst forth from the crimson scabbard, its cold aura sweeping through the barrier. Luo Tian showed no fear; his physical strength was always confident, and the Dragon Abyss Sword, a fearsome weapon from hell, he believed could shake even a peak True Immortal.

Thunderous clashes erupted as the two fought within the barrier, their exchanges leaving people awestruck. Luo Tian was no match for his opponent.

“Strong!”

“Who is the master of Xue Mian’s four disciples? They’re all absolute prodigies!” People marveled, their curiosity piqued about Luo Tian’s master.

“Lei Ming excels in physical strength, but Luo Tian's is even greater!” Tiansui’s gaze fell on Luo Tian with a solemn expression. He had known Luo Tian was no ordinary talent back in the Earthly King’s Palace, but at that time, Luo Tian had only reached the threshold of True Immortal. Now he was someone to be taken seriously, leaving Tiansui momentarily stunned.

Time passed as both men sustained injuries. Luo Tian showed no fear, exchanging blows with his physical advantage against Xue Zilong.

“Damn it!” Xue Zilong’s face darkened. He had underestimated Luo Tian, but once battle began, he realized how terrifying his opponent was. Each attack threatened him, especially that black sword—its wind alone could wound him.

Even more unbearable was his purple sword, which had begun to crack from repeated collisions.

“Crack!” After another clash, both men were thrown back, colliding with the barrier and spitting blood.

“Evenly matched!” People marveled at Luo Tian, initially thinking he was seeking his own demise. Now it seemed he truly had the strength to fight a peak True Immortal.

“Hum…” Xue Zilong planted his sword into the ground, hands moving in intricate seals. A purple pagoda descended from the heavens, its overwhelming pressure enveloping Luo Tian, finally making him take the fight seriously.

“Must use martial techniques?” Luo Tian chuckled lightly. He planted his Dragon Abyss Sword into the ground, and an immense pressure from the peak of True Immortal swept out, making all True Immortals—including those at the peak—feel its weight.

Luo Tian’s hands moved, and the Hellish Ghost Claws activated. Black ghost claws tore through space, appearing before everyone’s eyes.

“Crack!” The ghost claws struck the purple pagoda, which shattered into a storm of fragments.

“I’m so strong!” Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. He hadn’t expected himself to have grown this powerful. He had thought a battle with a peak True Immortal would require bloodshed, but he realized even he had underestimated himself. Now, Luo Tian could fight a peak True Immortal. If he fused the fragment of his soul from the Wheel Turning Palace, he could shake even a half-step Immortal King. Facing Duan Gao of the Heavenly Demon City, he wouldn’t have been so helpless.

Wind swept across Luo Tian and Xue Zilong’s bodies. Luo Tian moved swiftly, grabbing the Dragon Abyss Sword and rushing toward Xue Zilong with a single strike. The black sword cleaved the heavens, slicing down toward Xue Zilong.

“Bazao!” Xue Zilong’s eyes narrowed. His purple sword light flared, and his body vanished from the spot, colliding with Luo Tian’s black blade.

“Crack!” The collision echoed. Two beams of divine light flew apart, the Dragon Abyss Sword and purple sword embedded in the barrier. Luo Tian and Xue Zilong appeared before everyone’s eyes.

“Roar!” Xue Zilong moved his hands, eight purple dragons swirling around him. A second purple pagoda descended from the heavens, with the eight dragons coiling around it.

The world trembled as infinite power radiated from the pagoda. The overwhelming pressure made Luo Tian’s eyes narrow with determination.

“Dharma Body!” Luo Tian chanted, his body expanding. He roared the蛮神战歌 (Martial God War Song), with complex barbarian script surrounding him.

“Heaven and Earth!” A thousand-foot-tall figure stood before everyone’s eyes. With a thunderous roar, his massive fist struck the descending purple pagoda.

Three fists flashed, merging onto the pagoda. The explosion was deafening, and a wild wave of power surged outward.

“Boom!” A thunderous sound echoed through the heavens. The reinforced pagoda was shaken but still pressed down on Luo Tian.

“Hum…” Luo Tian struck again, this time with four shadowy images!

Four times the physical strength shattered the heavens, striking the eight dragons coiling around the pagoda.

“Crack!” The world trembled. Beneath Luo Tian’s feet, divine patterns spread outward. Even through the barrier, people heard the deafening explosion. A mid-stage True Immortal was instantly spitting blood.

The purple pagoda shattered into fragments of the Dao, vanishing from sight.

“It’s my turn!” Luo Tian transformed into a giant, gazing down at Xue Zilong with disdain.

“Martial God’s Wrath! Trampling the Heavens!” Luo Tian’s deep roar echoed, his black foot slowly lifting.

As Luo Tian lifted his foot, whirlwinds formed beneath it. Then, with a sudden stamp, he pressed down toward Xue Zilong.

“What can you do?” Xue Zilong’s eyes held disdain. Though the foot was grand, it didn’t threaten him. Xue Zilong raised his hands to the sky, summoning a barrier of purple qi to protect himself.

“Boom!” The black foot struck the purple barrier, which shattered under Luo Tian’s pressure, crushing Xue Zilong's hands.

“Crack!” Xue Zilong spat blood, his legs trembling but still holding on.

“Martial God’s Second Stamp! Shattering the Stars!” Luo Tian spoke again, using the second form of the Seven Steps of the Martial God. This time, two leg images were used, infused with the chaotic wind technique.

The Seven Steps of the Martial God was Luo Tian’s favorite martial art. However, since arriving in the Immortal realm, its power had been weakened. Yet Luo Tian had always pondered how to unleash it fully. Recently, he had finally understood. The Seven Steps of the Martial God required building up strength—each step stronger than the last. The chaotic wind technique enhanced his physical power, not just in arms but throughout his body.

Combining the Seven Steps of the Martial God with chaotic wind enhanced its power, allowing Luo Tian to unleash it.

Two times his physical strength combined with the martial technique was enough for anyone to take seriously. No peak True Immortal could be certain they could withstand it.

The heavens darkened, the winds reversed. The second step landed, crushing space and appearing above Xue Zilong’s head.

The immense pressure made Xue Zilong’s face change. He felt a strong sense of danger in this step.

“Make way!” Xue Zilong roared, his body emitting fierce winds. Purple mist surged upward, forming two purple hands that materialized into reality, draining half of Xue Zilong’s True Immortal power.

The explosion was deafening. The black foot collided with the purple hands, and an explosion erupted. This time, Luo Tian was shaken back, his massive body retreating. The entire barrier became a sea of purple, waves of pressure crashing against it, leaving the onlookers stunned.

“How could Luo Tian be so strong? Even I would have to fight with all my might!” A peak True Immortal commander spoke, his voice filled with awe as the purple sea receded, revealing Luo Tian’s giant form.

“Martial God's Third Stamp... Even the gods would be terrified!” As people marveled, a cold voice echoed again. The black foot lifted once more, Luo Tian’s face bearing mockery as he gazed at Xue Zilong, who was spitting blood and standing on the ground.

“Damn it! Not over yet!” Xue Zilong’s face was grim. He saw three foot images overlapping, but the pressure was several times stronger than before, giving him a sense of helplessness.

“Purple Sea Reverses the Heavens!” Xue Zilong spat blood, his hands moving swiftly. His body exploded in front of everyone’s eyes, transforming into a surge of purple qi that gradually coalesced into a vast purple sea.

But before the purple sea fully formed, Luo Tian’s foot descended with a thunderous crash upon it.

“Crash!” The purple sea churned, waves of violet rising and finally gathering a hundred feet away from Luo Tian.

“Cough!” Xue Zilong’s face was pale. He gazed at Luo Tian, who stood like a giant, feeling his weakness.

“How could someone of late-stage True Immortal be so strong!”

“His strength is at the peak!” Ke Duanshan spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

Luo Tian was truly astonishing. Many sects' prodigies had come to serve in Buxian City, so Ke Duanshan had seen generations of prodigies. He was certain no one could match Luo Tian.

“His future is boundless!” In the city lord's hall, Jiang Chen’s eyes showed shock. He had felt the battle between the two.

“He grows too fast! Only eight years!"

“Previously, he had some resentment toward me. This Buxian City can't keep him anymore!”

“He's close to Jiang Yuzze, the younger master. I'm part of the third son’s faction. If he returns to the Immortal realm, he'll be a great asset for Jiang Yuzze!” Jiang Chen’s eyes showed contemplation, with a hint of cruelty.

“Xue Zilong had no ability to resist!” People exclaimed, gazing at Luo Tian standing there.

“Is he even human? I feel he's more terrifying than Xue Mian!” Several commanders showed fear. Luo Tian’s attack was enough to make them lose their skin, and he was only at late-stage True Immortal. If he reached peak True Immortal, they would definitely be no match.

“Martial God’s Fourth Stamp! All gods retreat!” As people marveled, Luo Tian's cold voice echoed again. This time, Xue Zilong’s face turned pale.

He had already exhausted all his strength from the three steps. He understood Luo Tian’s fourth step was beyond his ability to withstand, unless he were at peak condition.

“I surrender! I surrender!” Xue Zilong shouted desperately, his voice filled with strong regret.

“I just became a commander! I hadn’t even warmed the position yet!” Xue Zilong’s inner voice cried out, his frustration reaching its peak.

“Boom…” However, the sound of thunder interrupted Xue Zilong’s regret. His thick foot merged together, four times his physical strength combined with the Seven Steps of the Martial God’s fourth stamp. It shattered the heavens, pressing down on Xue Zilong with a thunderous crash.

“He wants to kill me!” Xue Zilong saw the descending foot, his heart trembling. His chest tightened violently, eyes filled with disbelief.

“This is for avenging Xue Mian!” The onlookers understood, except Ke Duanshan and a few commanders. Others showed reverence toward Luo Tian.

“This kid is just like Xue Mian, truly a brother. His petty nature is the same!” Tiansui and others said with admiration, as if seeing another Xue Mian.

“Stop!” Ke Duanshan could no longer sit still. He flashed into the barrier, his golden sword radiating brilliance as he stood over Xue Zilong’s head.

“Boom!” The heavens and earth collapsed, a deafening sound echoed. An invisible wave spread outward, its power sweeping across the entire Eighth Army camp, shaking it like an earthquake.

“What's happening?” The entire Eighth Army was in a uproar. Everyone’s faces showed disbelief, gazing at the direction of the wave.

“I’m back!” A solemn voice echoed in the sky, resounding through the Eighth Army.

“Who is Luo Tian?” Hearing Luo Tian’s voice, people were startled. The entire Eighth Army suddenly paused.

Chapter 2209: My Legs Are Tired

Luo Tian, a prodigy of the Star River Mansion. Eight years ago, he vanished in the Earthly King’s Palace, changing the price of the Ghost-Repelling Pills.

At once, the entire Eighth Army spread stories about Luo Tian’s past, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Luo Tian is back?” Although most of the soldiers who had served in Buxian City had already returned to the Central Three Realms, there were still those who knew Luo Tian’s name.

Many former soldiers of Buxian City also recognized Luo Tian, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Luo Tian is back?” At that moment, a group of people were walking out of Buxian City. Hearing the solemn voice, their faces showed joy.

“Commander!” Huo Zhen and Zhang Desheng’s bodies trembled. Their minds conjured a figure—these people were those who had followed Luo Tian. After Luo Tian’s disappearance, Ye Liangchen hadn’t left; these people had followed Ye Liangchen.

“Commander! The commander has returned. But the Hundred-Commander, Ye Liangchen, is gone. Without finding Ye Liangchen, how can we face the commander?” Huo Zhen’s eyes showed guilt.

“Luo Tian? How coincidental!” Ye Chen frowned, gazing at the direction of Buxian City’s Eighth Army. He had just returned, and now Luo Tian was back. To Ye Chen, this seemed suspicious. However, he only pondered it briefly, as he was worried about Ye Liangchen and didn’t dwell on it. He followed Huo Zhen and others out of Buxian City.

At once, the entire Eighth Army was discussing Luo Tian, recalling his past deeds. People marveled at how strong he had been.

“Several hundred million battle merits! My mother, how did he do it in less than half a year!”

“His ghost-repelling pills are much better than the ones we currently use?”

“Fastest promotion to commander in Buxian City?” People kept discussing.

“Hum…” As people discussed, a light screen gradually rose from the center of the Eighth Army. Nine names appeared on it.

“Commander? This is a screen recording commanders!” People were startled, gazing at the screen.

Commanders were vital to Buxian City. Any personnel changes would be announced to the entire army.

Eighth Army, Xue Mian!

People exclaimed in surprise, seeing the words on the screen. The first name among the nine names had been erased.

“Was Xue Mian defeated?” People were stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“But it's not surprising. I heard Xue Mian’s body had changed, aged completely, his vitality faded, and his cultivation had begun to decline!” People whispered, their voices filled with sorrow.

“Unfortunately for Xue Mian. He was once so formidable, leading two disciples out of hell, fighting his way through, becoming a figure feared by the Kanmen!”

“After arriving in Buxian City, he was directly appointed as a commander. None of the commanders in Buxian City dared to disrespect Xue Mian!” People discussed, waiting for the new name on the screen.

“Xue Zilong!” Under people’s expectant gazes, a name finally appeared, causing chaos.

“Commander Xue Zilong! It's said he just reached the peak of True Immortal. This makes sense!” People whispered, but as they were in chaos, Xue Zilong’s name suddenly disappeared. Two big characters appeared before their eyes.

“Luo Tian!” People exclaimed, their faces filled with shock. The entire Eighth Army suddenly erupted.

“My god! Am I seeing things?”

“Why is it a commander? He's only been here for eight years!” Most of the Eighth Army people rubbed their eyes.

“A commander! From now on, Luo Tian won’t have to worry. After being missing for eight years, he returned and immediately became a commander!”

“If he serves one year as a commander, he can choose to enter Buxian Mountain and become a senior elder!” People showed envy, whispering among themselves.

“Little Tian is back!” At Buxian City’s gate, two figures stood. One was tall and strong, the other in black robes. Both had a tired look on their faces.

“Also became a commander! It seems your older brother gave the position to Little Tian!” The two listened to people’s discussions, gazing at the names in the sky and laughed heartily before heading into the inner courtyard.

Ke Duanshan stood there, his eyes filled with admiration as he gazed at Luo Tian standing opposite him. He spoke softly: “From today, you are the Eighth Army’s nine commanders. This courtyard is yours. You can receive a million battle merits monthly!”

Ke Duanshan was also amazed by Luo Tian’s strength. That one step had made him feel pressure, as he had to save Xue Zilong.

“Yes!” Luo Tian still stood there, a smile on his face. His eyes coldly gazed at Xue Zilong, an invisible aura radiating from him. Xue Zilong trembled, gazing at Luo Tian’s cold gaze. It was clear he hadn’t finished yet. His heart secretly cursed.

That one step had made Xue Zilong certain that even at his prime, he would have died in eight out of ten chances.

Other commanders smiled and greeted Luo Tian. His strength had earned their approval. Even they would have suffered if they had faced that one step.

With such strength, Luo Tian’s position as commander would be solid. Unlike Xue Zilong.

Luo Tian hadn’t moved from his spot, only smiling and greeting the other commanders and hundred-commanders.

After exchanging greetings, Ke Duanshan left. Others also departed. At the same time, two figures appeared in Luo Tian’s line of sight.

“Little Tian!” A thunderous voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making his face show a hint of joy.

“Second Brother, Third Brother!” Luo Tian was also delighted. However, seeing their tired faces, he knew they had probably searched for him in the battlefield.

“Why are you still standing? Come inside!”

“Young master, I didn’t expect your return to cause such a commotion!” Lei Yong laughed heartily and stepped beside Luo Tian.

“Second Brother, come help me up. My legs are numb!” Seeing Lei Yong instinctively wanting to pat his shoulder, Luo Tian smiled and grabbed Lei Yong’s arm.

“What happened?” Lei Yong and Ji Chen immediately approached Luo Tian, helping him up.

“Nothing. It's just some aftereffects from the martial technique. Rest for a while and it'll be fine!” Luo Tian shook his head. At that moment, his legs felt nonexistent. He hadn’t wanted to move but couldn’t—once he moved, he feared he would fall, causing more trouble.

“What happened?” Lei Yong and Ji Chen helped Luo Tian into the room, asking as they saw his swollen legs, which had grown several times thicker.

“Nothing. I just wanted to stomp Xue Zilong, and I overdid it!”

“You stomped too. Ha ha!” Luo Tian smiled carelessly. He knew his legs well; with the strength of a late-stage True Immortal, delivering an attack to kill a peak True Immortal naturally had its cost. This was only possible because of his strong physical body. If not for that, he might have been crippled by the powerful impact.

“Good thing you’re okay. That bastard Xue Zilong!” Lei Yong and Ji Chen, hearing Luo Tian was fine, recounted the events. Their faces darkened.

“Your older brother should be okay. What are your plans now?” Lei Yong asked, gazing at Luo Tian.

“I plan to return to the Central Three Realms and gather all the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. This plan had been in his mind since he first arrived in the Immortal realm, but he hadn’t acted due to insufficient strength. Now that his strength could withstand a peak True Immortal, though establishing a sect was difficult, he could form a small faction. However, Luo Tian hadn’t immediately organized it but wanted to become an Immortal King—at least a half-step one—to qualify for establishing a sect.

“Star River Mansion, Buxian Mountain!” Luo Tian planned to first return to Star River Mansion and then visit Buxian Mountain, checking out the Central Three Realms. If possible, he would also learn about the Eternal Life Mountain, as it was their true enemy.

“Hmph. Stay in Buxian City for another year. After a year, you’ll be an elder at Buxian Mountain. It'll make things easier! Then we’ll go back with you!” Lei Yong spoke softly. Eternal Life Mountain was a great mountain. Even though their current strength could stand in the Immortal realm, they were still far from it.

After three brothers exchanged words, Luo Tian also told them about his experiences in hell, leaving the two stunned.

“This hell is our retreat. Only when desperate should we enter it!” Luo Tian spoke softly. Though he held a high position in the Wheel Turning Palace, he disliked hell’s environment and atmosphere.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen left, leaving Luo Tian to recover in the room. After a night’s rest, his legs gradually regained some sensation. Luo Tian estimated they would be fine in two more days.

“Little Tian, are you feeling better?” The next morning, Lei Yong’s voice echoed outside Luo Tian’s room. Before he finished speaking, the two entered.

“What is this?” However, what caught Luo Tian’s attention was a golden cart pushed by Lei Yong.

Chapter 2210: Demon Hill

A golden cart with two golden wheels stood out. It had a single seat for one person, pushed in by Lei Yong.

“Second Brother, what is this?” Luo Tian felt a bad premonition. He looked at Lei Yong’s eyes, which had bloodshot veins.

“You can’t walk properly, so I spent a fortune and made this for you overnight. Come on, let me help you sit down!” Lei Yong didn’t wait for Luo Tian’s consent. He grabbed him and forced him into the seat.

“Look, isn’t it more comfortable? I can push you around. If we’re not here, you can use your cultivation to move it yourself!” Lei Yong was eager and immediately pushed Luo Tian out of the room.

“This….” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched. He just needed two days to recover, but after Lei Yong did this, he felt like a cripple.

Luo Tian didn’t get down. It wasn’t that he wanted to, but his legs couldn’t move. He had no choice but to let Lei Yong push him around the courtyard.

“Second Brother, thanks!” Luo Tian sighed with a smile, watching Lei Yong’s enthusiasm.

“Let’s go for a walk in the military camp. I want everyone to see my great invention!” Lei Yong’s face showed pride, pushing Luo Tian out of the courtyard. Ji Chen followed behind with a frown, feeling embarrassed but unable to leave Luo Tian alone for fear of something happening.

Within half an hour, Lei Yong pushed Luo Tian out of the inner courtyard and into the view of the Eighth Army.

“Who is this? What’s his appearance?” The three's appearance immediately caught people's attention, their eyes filled with confusion as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Are those not Lei Ming and Heiye, the two hundred-commanders?”

“They’re pushing someone. Is it Xue Mian? No, Xue Mian has white hair. This man has black hair!” People were confused. Only Xue Mian could be pushed by Lei Ming and Heiye.

“Luo Tian! It’s Luo Tian!” Someone suddenly exclaimed, their eyes filled with shock as they gazed at the man sitting there.

“The new commander, Luo Tian?”

“Why are his legs like that?” People immediately asked, gazing at the man sitting on the golden cart.

“Everyone look! This is the new commander, Luo Tian. He’s my younger brother!”

“You know why his legs are like this? Because he fought with Xue Zilong and was injured!”

“Is he crippled?” People widened their eyes, gazing at Luo Tian’s legs covered by Lei Yong.

“If he is truly crippled, then we might have a chance to challenge and become commander!” Someone’s mind was active.

“Look where you’re looking. His legs will be fine in a few days. Look at this cart!”

“Everyone gets injured on the battlefield. Even a commander was injured! With this cart, you won’t be unable to move after injuring your legs!”

“Just a little cultivation can let this cart replace your legs. Come on, younger brother, demonstrate it for everyone!” Lei Yong said and immediately lifted Luo Tian and the cart, throwing them out.

“I….”

Luo Tian was speechless. He understood Lei Yong’s intention and felt like laughing, but he needed this cart now. So he infused his cultivation into the golden cart.

“Hum…” Waves of energy immediately radiated from the cart. The two golden wheels began to spin.

“Boom!” Next moment, Luo Tian and the cart landed on the ground. However, the golden wheels spun rapidly, leaving a trail of gold light. Luo Tian’s figure vanished from people's sight.

“Fast!” Luo Tian’s face slightly changed. When he realized, he was already a hundred feet away.

“Danger!”

“Young master, stop!” Lei Yong’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Luo Tian's face turned grim.

“I swear, how do I stop….” Luo Tian saw a solid wall ahead. He was about to crash into it. If he did, it wouldn’t be serious but would definitely be embarrassing.

“Stop!” Luo Tian mentally shouted. He immediately stopped his cultivation, and the golden cart instantly halted.

“Cultivation is power. Use your spiritual awareness to control direction!” Lei Yong’s face was awkward as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“You didn’t say that earlier…” Luo Tian muttered, his spiritual awareness infiltrating the cart and controlling it.

After a while, Luo Tian became proficient. Under people’s watchful eyes, he started moving and finally returned to Lei Yong and Ji Chen.

“Everyone saw it! This is a great invention. If anyone wants one, contact me! Starting now, the first hundred people get a 30% discount. I’ll also select ten people from these hundred to give them a ghost-repelling pill!”

“This ghost-repelling pill is no small thing. Eight years ago, it was popular throughout Buxian City and worth fifty thousand battle merits!” Lei Yong spoke endlessly, his face showing the demeanor of a shrewd merchant.

“His greed hasn’t changed over the years!” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at Lei Yong who was already speaking eloquently to those interested.

“He’s the richest! Sometimes he even舍不得 take a single pill!” Ji Chen said, standing beside Luo Tian. Many people were observing Luo Tian, staring at his legs to know what was wrong with them.

Soon, the news that Luo Tian’s legs were injured or crippled spread throughout the Eighth Army, causing a huge uproar.

“Of course! That’s why he stood there after defeating Xue Zilong!” Several commanders showed realization.

“Of course, how could a late-stage True Immortal perform such powerful martial arts!” A deep voice echoed in the courtyard. Xue Zilong’s face was grim as he spoke.

Xue Zilong had returned the day before and started to recover. After a night, his cultivation and injuries were restored. When he came out, he heard this news, making him feel hope again. Xue Zilong was very angry at Luo Tian. If it weren’t for Luo Tian, he would have been lying in the commander’s room, waiting for the hundred-commanders’ loyalty. But Luo Tian had shattered his peaceful life, leaving him to heal in his own bed. In his mind, everything was because of Luo Tian—Luo Tian had shattered all his life and made him a laughingstock in the Eighth Army.

Three steps had forced him to surrender. The fourth step almost killed him. The shortest commander in history.

“However, this bastard isn’t easy to provoke. I don’t know if it’s truly crippled or fake. There are definitely some fools who can't resist and want to take this position.” Xue Zilong sneered, not acting rashly but watching the situation develop. Others didn’t dare to act either, as everyone knew that Luo Tian had almost killed a peak True Immortal with four steps. Who could be so careless to sit in the commander’s position, including even Xue Zilong who had only held it for a short time.

Time passed. An hour later, Lei Yong showed satisfaction and approached Luo Tian.

“Little Tian, give me ten ghost-repelling pills!” Lei Yong rubbed his hands together, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian looked at Lei Yong with helplessness and handed him ten pills. Lei Yong had this habit, so Luo Tian didn’t ruin his mood.

“Tsk tsk. Two million battle merits are in my hands!” Lei Yong’s eyes showed satisfaction as he placed the carts out.

The carts Lei Yong released were different in color from Luo Tian’s, being silver-white, obviously of inferior material.
