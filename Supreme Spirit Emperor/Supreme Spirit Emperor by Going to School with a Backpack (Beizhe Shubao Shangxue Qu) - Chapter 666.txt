"Who? Without hostile intent, my restrictions would not be triggered!" Luo Tian's heart grew anxious. His body flickered as he accelerated, rushing toward the Blood Wolf Valley. However, even with his speed, it would take half a day to reach the Blood Wolf Valley—half a day in which much could transpire.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, realizing that his restrictions had been partially triggered during his flight.

"So many people! How could it be so coincidental? If they were ordinary explorers, they wouldn't have arrived in such numbers!"

"They're after Su Dan! It must be one of those Heavenly Kings who leaked her location!" Luo Tian instantly deduced, his mind racing with wild speculations. His face darkened with regret; he should have forcibly taken Su Dan and Leng Qiuchan back to the Wheel Turning Sect, avoiding this current worry.

"Why did he suddenly accelerate?" Fu Xingxuan, who had been secretly following Luo Tian, furrowed her brow in confusion. But soon after, her expression shifted slightly as she too quickened her pace, chasing Luo Tian's direction.

In a state of anxious anticipation, Luo Tian flew relentlessly. After two hours, he once again arrived at the Blood Wolf Valley. He could clearly see disturbances outside the valley, and without hesitation, he rushed into it.

"Corpses!" Along his path, Luo Tian saw countless corpses—most were wolves, and as he delved deeper, he found the bodies of blue wolves scattered with blood across the ground.

Chapter 2494: King Zhou Gui (Zhou Gui Wang)

The entire wooden hut was surrounded by blood, with several wolf corpses and human bodies. The atmosphere of a battle still lingered.

"Where are they?" Luo Tian's face darkened as he found no sign of Su Dan and Leng Qiuchan.

"What's going on?" Fu Xingxuan also arrived, gazing at the chaos around them.

"Why are you here?" Luo Tian was surprised Fu Xingxuan had followed him.

"I feared you wouldn't return. Now, if Su Dan and Qiuchan are harmed, I'll never forgive you!" Fu Xingxuan was on the verge of tears. If Gu Qianxue and Jiang Sxi learned about this, how could she face them?

"Don't panic. I'll find them!" Luo Tian's expression darkened, his hands moving swiftly.

"Soul come!" An invisible wave emanated from Luo Tian's hands. A surge of gray mist immediately rose from the corpses on the ground.

"Damn it, their souls are gone?" Luo Tian's face darkened. Only faint soul energy remained—no complete soul was present.

"Go to the back mountain!" Luo Tian leapt into the air, rushing toward the back mountain. He knew there was a Blood Lotus there; those who attacked Su Dan and Leng Qiuchan would not have overlooked such a rare treasure.

Fu Xingxuan followed Luo Tian, and the two reached the back mountain. There were also wolf corpses and human bodies scattered about.

A deep pit appeared, surrounded by vitality, indicating it had once been a sacred place.

Still no success. Luo Tian tore open a corpse; none of the clothes bore special markings.

"It must be those people who leaked Su Dan and Qiuchan's location!"

"The Eight Heavenly Kings! It must be the forces of Zhou Gui Wang who captured them. As for who, we'll settle that later!" Luo Tian's body radiated a massive killing intent as he flew toward Zhou Gui Wang's city.

"Xingxuan, go to the Hell of Fire and find my master Du Jianhang!" Luo Tian addressed Fu Xingxuan, for Zhou Gui Wang's city was not so easily entered. The only person he could rely on in the underworld besides the Black and White Kings was Du Jianhang.

"If Su Dan is unharmed, fine. But if she's harmed, I'll make Zhou Gui Wang drown in blood!" Luo Tian's fury surged. His killing intent roared as he pushed his speed to the limit, transforming into a long crimson streak that made the entire sky tremble.

Time passed slowly. As dusk approached, Luo Tian had not yet reached Zhou Gui Wang's city but instead passed through the City of the Sealing King.

"Master Luo Tian of the Wheel Turning Sect, I'm just passing through. Please forgive me, elder!" Luo Tian called out loudly, fearing the previous Sealing King might misunderstand and delay his journey.

"Go ahead," the old Sealing King frowned slightly but sensed Luo Tian's violent aura, realizing he must have urgent matters.

"Thank you, elder. Once I've dealt with this matter, I'll return to apologize!" Luo Tian transformed into a streak of light and flew over the City of the Sealing King.

"Master Luo Tian of the Wheel Turning Sect!" The people in the City of the Sealing King looked shocked before understanding.

"Does he owe you a favor?" The old Sealing King asked Mo Er, his face pale.

"He does owe one, but..." Mo Er's expression was grim, as if reluctant to speak further.

"Ah?" But Luo Tian sensed a familiar aura from the Sealing King's domain, and his blood sword emitted waves.

"Never mind. Let's go to the City of the Sealing King first!" Luo Tian ignored it and flew over the city.

Another day passed. Finally, Luo Tian saw his destination—the vast City of Zhou Gui Wang. His face darkened.

"It's indeed here!" Luo Tian felt a connection within the Sealing King's domain, an instinctual bond from his bloodline.

...At this moment, in the central hall of the City of Zhou Gui Wang.

An old man sat there. He was the previous Zhou Gui Wang, Su Peng. However, Su Peng's expression was poor as he looked at Su Dan, who was bound and holding a child.

"You've birthed this wretched child. You've shamed me!" Su Peng shouted, snatching the child from Su Dan's arms.

"Father, let me eliminate this wretched child!" Su Kai smiled as he approached Su Peng. Su Peng's face darkened to the core, gazing at the child in his arms. His hands trembled as he struggled to kill it, but seeing the baby's face, a man who had killed countless people as the Sealing King could not bring himself to do it.

"Wha...!" The baby cried, its large eyes full of innocence and sympathy. The Sealing King's eyes glowed with intense light, staring at the child in his arms. Suddenly, he noticed an imprint on the baby's head.

"What is this..." The Sealing King furrowed his brows, knocking Su Kai's hand away with a look of contemplation.

"This is my clan's ancestral imprint!" The Sealing King exclaimed, suddenly realizing what the mark on the baby's forehead was.

"Su Dan, who is this child's father? If you tell me, I won't追究 it. And no matter who he is, I'll ensure the two of you are married! Even if he's a Heavenly King, I have the means to bring you together!" The Sealing King spoke with joy. He had decided not to kill the child, for this ancestral imprint meant the child's future was limitless. If nurtured properly, it might become a figure like the first ancestor of the Sealing King City.

Hearing the Sealing King's words, Su Kai's expression darkened. He had become the new Zhou Gui Wang because Su Dan suddenly gave birth to a child, which the Sealing King saw as an embarrassment and faced resistance. It was precisely this reason that Su Kai had the confidence to act recklessly. This time, he received news and found Su Dan's location.

Su Dan had just given birth and was weakened. Although Leng Qiuchan and the blue wolves were strong, they were outnumbered. The city's top warriors had all been mobilized, so Su Kai only lost some people before capturing Su Dan and Leng Qiuchan. It wasn't that Su Kai didn't want to kill Su Dan; it was because Su Peng had ordered not to. If they killed her, his position would be lost.

Moreover, Su Kai still thought Su Dan had some value. Many strong people liked beautiful women and could use her as a gift to one of them. Su Kai hadn't expected that Su Dan would try to turn the situation around with a child. The Sealing King's attitude clearly showed he valued this child greatly, implying he would let Su Dan live.

"Where are the sisters who were with me?" Su Dan looked at the old Sealing King and Su Kai.

"They fled, injured!" Su Kai's face darkened as he spoke solemnly.

"That's good!" Su Dan smiled slightly, feeling deep guilt toward Leng Qiuchan. She had previously escaped injured to the Blood Wolf Valley, where Leng Qiuchan saved her, disrupting Leng Qiuchan's quiet life.

And now, Luo Tian's arrival had made Leng Qiuchan despair. Both loved the same man—Luo Tian only remembered her.

Now, because of herself, Leng Qiuchan had risked her life to protect her. Su Dan felt immense guilt.

"Tell me, who is it? I won't trouble him!" The Sealing King gazed at the baby in his arms, growing more fond with each glance.

...But just as the Sealing King's words had barely finished, waves rose from above the City of the Sealing King. A barrier enveloped the city.

"Sealing Barrier?" The old Sealing King and Su Kai were puzzled. The old Sealing King ordered Su Kai: "Go outside and check!"

"Yes!" Su Kai's expression sharpened. This was his chance to show himself; he couldn't miss it.

Luo Tian appeared above the City of Zhou Gui Wang, gazing at its barrier. His aura instantly spread, causing the people within the city to change faces in fear. That overwhelming killing intent made the citizens tremble.

"Luo Tian!" Su Kai suddenly appeared, his cultivation at the early stage of the Heavenly King. He unleashed it with a heavy gaze.

"What are you doing in my City of Zhou Gui Wang?" Su Kai shouted, recalling the scene where Luo Tian had beaten Duan Zijue at the Wheel Turning Sect. But now, this was the City of Zhou Gui Wang, and no demonic beasts were at Luo Tian's disposal.

"Where is Su Dan?" Luo Tian coldly asked, pulling his blood sword from his back. If Su Kai didn't satisfy him, Luo Tian would definitely strike.

"Killed! She's dead!" Su Kai wanted to show himself at this moment. Seeing Luo Tian's furious anger, he hoped to provoke him and let the Sealing King see who was worthy of succession.

...Luo Tian felt as if struck by lightning. He thought of Su Dan, Leng Qiuchan, and also his newborn child who hadn't even been a month old. Luo Tian's chest heaved violently. He had lost his memory, and to him, this was the first time being a father. But now, his child had been killed just days after birth, and this made Luo Tian completely mad.

"Kill..." Su Kai's words had indeed angered Luo Tian, but the cost was extremely heavy.

"Today I'll make the City of Zhou Gui Wang drown in blood, to accompany Su Dan and her child!" Luo Tian roared. A crimson long sword slashed out.

Boom... The violent aura instantly erupted, a blood-red blade radiating an eerie presence. It slashed downward toward Su Kai.

Su Kai gasped in shock upon seeing the blood-red blade, realizing that even without demonic beasts at his disposal, Luo Tian was terrifyingly strong.

"Boom..." Su Kai also brandished a black long sword. The two blades clashed in the sky.

Crack... A thunderous sound echoed over the City of Zhou Gui Wang. Su Kai was immediately sent flying backward, his eyes filled with disbelief.

He knew Luo Tian was strong, but he hadn't expected him to be this strong. With just one strike, he had been repelled by Luo Tian.

"Everyone must die!" Luo Tian's eyes turned crimson, his madness evident. He gripped the sword with both hands and slashed downward again. The massive blade cleaved through the black sky, striking Su Kai once more.

"Wow!" The people of the City of Zhou Gui Wang gasped, watching the blade that dominated the sky.

Chapter 2495: Son-in-Law

"Ah..." Su Kai instantly felt a life-threatening crisis. He raised his long sword to meet it.

Roars echoed continuously. Above Su Kai's head, a sound of friction was heard. In the next moment, his body fell and crashed into the city's sealing barrier.

"Boom..." The sealing barrier shattered with a thunderous explosion. Su Kai's body directly crashed into the ground of the City of Zhou Gui Wang, sending out invisible waves that spread outward.

Boom... The thunderous sound shook the city. A large area of the City of Zhou Gui Wang was destroyed, and Su Kai lay in a massive pit. His eyes were filled with fear as he looked up at Luo Tian, who had descended and was now charging toward him again.

"How strong!" Su Kai's mind trembled. He too was at the early stage of the Heavenly King, but he felt incredibly small before Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Su Kai didn't dare to delay. He rose again and raised his sword toward Luo Tian, determined to establish his image. How could he be so disgraceful?

In a flash, the two long swords collided again. Su Kai was sent flying backward once more, his sword now covered with cracks.

"Damn it! His is an极品仙器!" Su Kai's face changed. He quickly altered his hands, summoning a black dragon that roared and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Die!" Luo Tian single-handedly formed a hand seal. A black vortex rose from the sky, roaring as it slammed down with sharp claws.

The thunderous sound shook all directions. The entire City of Zhou Gui Wang trembled, and more buildings collapsed due to the wild waves.

"Die!" Luo Tian roared. His eyes were crimson with fury, his killing intent wild as he rushed toward Su Kai.

"I'll fight you!" Su Kai shouted. His body radiated a mad aura, and black qi enveloped him completely. The black qi instantly transformed into a massive beast.

Five thick tails hovered behind Su Kai, and the black claws slammed down.

"Ah!" The people of the City of Zhou Gui Wang were shocked. They watched as a black fox had formed, its five tails.

"Nine-Tailed Heavenly Fox!" The people of the City of Zhou Gui Wang looked shocked, watching the black fox that had formed.

"More tails mean greater strength. I heard the previous Zhou Gui Wang could form seven," they whispered.

"But seven is the limit. Except for the first Zhou Gui Wang, no one has ever formed nine tails," they murmured.

"Boom..." As the people were shocked, the black claws descended from the sky and directly struck Luo Tian.

"Get out..." Luo Tian remained cold. He formed a hand seal, and four dragons and four tigers appeared in the sky, roaring as they stood over the heavens.

"This..." Everyone gasped. They watched the eight massive creatures in the sky.

"Roar..." The roar echoed, and the eight massive creatures rushed toward the five-tailed fox. In terms of aura and size, the five-tailed fox was significantly weaker.

Boom... The four dragons and four tigers pressed down, the powerful sound of explosions echoing throughout the City of Zhou Gui Wang. Wind and waves swept up, turning the area around Su Kai into ruins.

"Kill..." Luo Tian's crimson eyes glared as he rushed into the storm toward Su Kai's direction.

"Stop us from harming our Heavenly King!" Just as Luo Tian rushed out, several voices echoed around. Several elders appeared, two at the early stage of the Heavenly King and three at the semi-stage of the Heavenly King. They blocked Luo Tian's path.

"Who blocks me, I kill them! Even if Su Peng comes, it won't help!" Luo Tian growled. His blood-red long sword transformed into a sharp blade and slashed again, breaking through the dust.

"Block it!" The two elders with early Heavenly King cultivation changed faces but still gritted their teeth and stepped forward. One held a long sword, raising it above his head.

Boom... Another explosion. The two elders' legs were deeply embedded in the ground, and the blood-red blade exploded above their heads. Three semi-stage Heavenly King elders spat blood and were blown away by the wild waves.

"My god, is this even a person!"

"Wait, I remember. The Heavenly King called him Luo Tian. He is the Holy Son of the Wheel Turning Sect, the next Grand Master!" The people of the City of Zhou Gui Wang suddenly gasped. They watched Luo Tian, who was overflowing with power.

"Move aside!" Luo Tian raised his sword again and slashed once more. The blood-red blade appeared above the two elders.

This time, it directly pressed the two elders into the ground. Only their heads remained, and their arms trembled continuously as they spat blood.

Luo Tian moved swiftly, bypassing the two and approaching Su Kai who lay half-dead behind them.

"Enough..." Just as Luo Tian was about to strike Su Kai, Su Peng finally couldn't bear it. He appeared before Luo Tian with a terrifying aura and reached out to collide with Luo Tian's blood sword. A black hand shattered under the blood sword, and the powerful impact made Luo Tian take two steps back.

"Su Peng!" Luo Tian's face darkened as he coldly spoke. He knew Su Peng would definitely appear, and he had prepared to confront him.

"Kid, why did you come to our City of Zhou Gui Wang?" Su Peng's face showed no trace of blame but instead a smile. He had lived this long and naturally understood why Luo Tian was here.

On the contrary, Su Peng viewed Luo Tian quite favorably. He was the Holy Son of the Wheel Turning Sect, his strength surpassing eight Heavenly Kings. In the Ten Palace Grand Competition, he had even made other palace's Holy Sons unable to hold their heads up.

"Where is Su Dan?" Luo Tian saw Su Peng's smile and was surprised. He didn't know why Su Peng had this attitude.

"Who is Su Dan to you? Why would you risk your life for her?" Su Peng asked Luo Tian. He looked at the half-dead Su Kai and then at his grandson, growing more satisfied with Luo Tian each time. He looked like a father-in-law looking at his son-in-law.

This gaze made Luo Tian feel uncomfortable, as if the old man was acting strangely.

"Move aside!"

"Su Dan is your daughter. Even a fierce mother wouldn't eat her child. You let her die, and you're not in good shape either. Today I'll destroy your City of Zhou Gui Wang!" Luo Tian roared, and with a thunderous sound, his body transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward Su Kai.

But just as Luo Tian moved, a black hand descended from the sky with overwhelming power and struck Luo Tian's body.

"Boom..." A闷 sound echoed. Dust spread, and Luo Tian lay on the ground, coughing up blood. His crimson eyes held disbelief.

"Kid, even the Black and White Kings wouldn't dare to touch me here in the City of Zhou Gui Wang!" Su Peng smiled.

"I don't believe it!" Luo Tian's mind was shocked. The aura alone had made him unable to resist, and the palm hadn't even reached him before he was already suppressed.

With a roar, Luo Tian stood up but was immediately knocked down again by Su Peng's palm.

"Boom..." Third time, Luo Tian wasn't willing to give up but had no surprise. He was completely suppressed by Su Peng. If it weren't for Su Peng letting go, Luo Tian wouldn't even have the strength to stand up.

"How is this possible!" Luo Tian's mind was in turmoil. He hadn't expected Su Peng to be so strong.

"Wait, something's wrong. Su Peng said that in the City of Zhou Gui Wang, if he went out, he wouldn't be so strong. It's the method left by the Eight Heavenly Kings to protect their descendants!" Luo Tian suddenly understood.

"Those three blows were your three bows. I accept this great gift!"

"Kid, answer my question. Who is Su Dan to you? Why are you so determined!" Su Peng smiled and asked Luo Tian.

"I am the mother of his child!" Luo Tian coldly replied. At this point, he had no choice but to admit it.

"Then you acknowledge Su Dan as your wife!" Su Peng shouted, his voice like a thunderclap throughout the City of Zhou Gui Wang.

"So what if it is!" Luo Tian roared. Su Dan had given birth to his child, and in Luo Tian's heart, she was already his wife. Due to responsibility, he had to acknowledge it.

"Good!" Su Peng laughed and waved his hand. A figure appeared.

A red long dress, a face of beauty that could make the city tremble. She radiated an alluring aura and held a baby in her arms.

"Su Dan!" Luo Tian gasped, watching Su Dan standing there with a look of deep emotion. Without hesitation, he flew toward her.

"You..." Luo Tian carefully examined her and found that Su Dan and the baby were unharmed. He sighed deeply.

"Kid, from now on, you are my son-in-law of the City of Zhou Gui Wang!" Su Peng laughed and spoke to Luo Tian.

"You've been tricked!" Luo Tian instantly understood. This Su Peng was clearly trying to trick him, wanting him to acknowledge Su Dan's status.

"What did you come for!" Su Dan felt touched but, upon thinking of Leng Qiuchan, her face turned cold.

"I..." Luo Tian didn't know how to respond. Even with low emotional intelligence, he knew he couldn't say it was Fu Xingxuan who had sent him.

"Where is she?" Luo Tian looked around but didn't see Leng Qiuchan. His heart dropped.

"Did you even remember? She fled injured!" Su Dan felt even worse upon hearing Luo Tian mention Leng Qiuchan.

"Boom..." Just as Su Dan's words had barely finished, waves rose from behind the fallen Su Kai. A silver light appeared and directly pierced into Su Kai's throat.

"Who!" Su Peng's face darkened. Killing his son in front of him was clearly an insult to his dignity.

"I!" A cold voice echoed. A woman in a purple robe appeared, her face obscured by gauze. Her long purple hair flowed, and her eyes revealed a fierce killing intent. Behind Fu Xingxuan stood two elders with smiles, but their expressions were icy.

Chapter 2497: Return to the Wheel Turning Sect

"Fu Du Palace has sent a message. I need to go to Fu Du Palace!" Su Peng spoke to Du Jianhang.

"We should also be discussing this matter upon returning," Du Jianhang replied. Their conversation left Luo Tian and others confused, not knowing what they were talking about.

"Whether it's good or bad..." Du Jianhang and Su Peng sighed deeply.

"Starting today, Su Dan is the new Zhou Gui Wang!" Su Peng's voice echoed throughout the City of Zhou Gui Wang, causing people to gasp.

"The result is out..."

"Miss Su Dan has become the Zhou Gui Wang again!" The people of the City of Zhou Gui Wang were happy or sad. Especially those who had supported Su Kai and chased after Su Dan, they knew their future would not be easy.

"I need to find Leng Qiuchan!" As Du Jianhang and others prepared to leave, Luo Tian spoke up, causing their bodies to slightly pause.

"Luo Tian, let's discuss this after returning to the Wheel Turning Sect. What if she hasn't entered the Ghost River?" Du Jianhang began to persuade Luo Tian, knowing his stubbornness. He had tried hard to stop him from leaving the Wheel Turning Sect before.

Fu Xingxuan and Su Dan felt a bit regretful. They shouldn't have spoken so harshly, but now it was too late; Luo Tian's stubbornness had surfaced, and it would be difficult to bring him back.

"Regardless of the past, she is my wife. Since we have been married, I must fulfill my husband's responsibility!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. Otherwise, he would feel like a complete scoundrel.

Fu Xingxuan and Su Dan looked at each other with admiration. When Luo Tian said he would go find Leng Qiuchan, their eyes lit up, believing they hadn't loved in vain. But soon after, it turned into anxiety.

"It's over..." Fu Xingxuan sighed inwardly. Su Dan might not know Luo Tian's stubbornness, but she had been with him for years. Even though he was amnesic, she knew his inner nature hadn't changed.

"Let's put finding her on hold for now. Let's return to the Wheel Turning Sect first and see if we can find her through it!" Du Jianhang spoke.

"I'll go look for her first. I won't be so foolish as to enter the Ghost River immediately. Let me wait a while and see if there's any news!" Luo Tian replied, not intending to return to the Wheel Turning Sect.

"Alright, since you're so determined, I won't stop you. Come here, and I'll give you something!" Du Jianhang sighed and gestured for Luo Tian to come closer.

Luo Tian naturally wouldn't disobey Du Jianhang. He slowly approached him, his eyes filled with confusion.

"Boom..." Du Jianhang extended a hand. A gust of wind flew from his hand and instantly entered Luo Tian's spine, causing him to pause. He looked at Du Jianhang.

"Master, why go through all this!" Luo Tian's face showed a bitter smile. He could feel a sword energy within his body, radiating an overwhelming aura that directly suppressed his cultivation.

"Strong!" The Zhou Gui King watched Du Jianhang's action, his face changing. He hadn't expected Du Jianhang to suppress an early-stage Heavenly King with just a sword energy.

"Alright, we'll take our leave!" Du Jianhang bowed to the Zhou Gui King and led Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan out of the City of Zhou Gui Wang, flying toward the Wheel Turning Sect.

Luo Tian's cultivation was suppressed. He felt helpless and could only be led back to the Wheel Turning Sect by Du Jianhang and others. Their speed was not slow, and after flying for half a day, they saw Mo Er, the current Sealing King, and his father, the previous Sealing King, Mo Dao.

"Master Sword尊!" Mo Dao was slightly surprised and bowed to Du Jianhang. Mo Er stood behind Mo Dao, looking at Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan.

"Master Sword尊, your cultivation has improved again!" Du Jianhang returned the bow with a surprised look at Mo Dao and Mo Er.

"Ha ha, I've made some progress recently. But compared to Master Sword尊, it's still far behind!" Mo Dao laughed after hearing Du Jianhang's words.

"Master Fu Du has asked us to go there today. I won't have time to chat with Master Sword尊, but I'll invite you to my Sealing King City another day!" Mo Dao spoke again, explaining his intention.

"Master Mo Dao, please!" Du Jianhang naturally wouldn't block him and didn't care. He led Luo Tian and others toward the Wheel Turning Sect.

But just as they passed by Mo Dao and Mo Er, Luo Tian's eyes slightly changed.

"Wait!" Luo Tian spoke up, causing the two groups to stop. Mo Dao and Mo Er looked surprised.

"You have the scent of Blood Lotus!" Luo Tian, though his cultivation was suppressed, could still speak.

"Ha ha, this matter owes a lot to Luo Brother. If it weren't for you, I might have already become a corpse!" Mo Er quickly thanked Luo Tian and felt nervous.

"Something's wrong! How did you know? You drank something from the Blood Lotus?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness, making Mo Er's face pale instantly.

"I also returned to the city and checked after that. I found out it was from the Blood Lotus!" Mo Er quickly replied.

"You're lying. The truth is, you informed Su Kai and made a deal. You got the Blood Lotus, and Su Kai captured Su Dan!" Luo Tian coldly spoke.

"I..." Mo Er was about to speak, but a firestorm suddenly surrounded them.

"Speak up! If you can't explain it today, don't expect to leave. Have the Eight Heavenly Kings become so arrogant that they dare to target the Wheel Turning Sect's people?" Yu Tian's eyes showed a cold smile, looking at Mo Dao and Mo Er.

Mo Dao looked puzzled at Mo Er, not knowing when he had offended Luo Tian. He thought Luo Tian owed Mo Er a favor.

"Is it true?" Mo Dao looked at Mo Er, seeing the coldness in Du Jianhang and Yu Tian's eyes. His sweat immediately flowed down.

"Without evidence, Brother Luo, don't accuse me!" Mo Er spoke to Luo Tian.

"Evidence?" Luo Tian coldly smiled, his eyes even colder. He took out the blood sword and let it emit waves.

As the waves spread over everyone, others weren't affected much. But Mo Er's face turned grim. Blood energy flowed from his body, and a powerful wave began to emerge from Mo Er's hands.

Boom! A blood-colored flower appeared in people's sight, radiating an eerie atmosphere but containing astonishing vitality. The red petals resembled faces.

"Boom..." The blood-colored flower slowly flew toward Luo Tian's blood sword, as if absorbed by it. It transformed into an imprint and was engraved onto the blood sword.

"Give it back..." Mo Er spoke, this was something he had obtained with great difficulty. But now it had been taken by Luo Tian.

"Give it back? If it weren't for Leng Qiuchan and Su Dan saving you, you would have already gone mad. Yet you repaid their kindness with betrayal and told Su Kai where they were!" Luo Tian coldly spoke. He had felt something was wrong when he passed through the Sealing King City, but he was too eager to reach Zhou Gui Wang and hadn't thought it through.

"Dead..." Fu Xingxuan understood and rushed toward Mo Er with her sword. She had realized that if it weren't for Mo Er's betrayal, Leng Qiuchan wouldn't have entered the Ghost River.

In an instant, a streak of light descended upon Mo Er's body and directly pierced his throat.

"Damn it!" Mo Er's face darkened. Facing a death threat, he couldn't help but resist. He formed hand seals and summoned a black long sword, sweeping it to deflect Fu Xingxuan's attack.

"Still dare to resist!" Du Jianhang's eyes turned cold, showing anger. He extended his hand and the sky instantly changed.

"Boom..." As if an invisible wave, a sword domain immediately enveloped everything. The powerful aura directly restrained the entire sky.

"Ah, Master Sword尊 is angry!" Yu Tian's lips curled. He withdrew his fire domain. He knew how terrifying Du Jianhang was when angry.

Years ago, because of Luo Tian, Du Jianhang had almost killed him with several swords. It was only because he was a senior of the Wheel Turning Sect and Black and White Kings had intervened that he survived.

At the same time, Mo Er's body suddenly stopped. His shoulder was pierced by Fu Xingxuan's sword.

"Come here!" Du Jianhang coldly muttered and extended his hand, directly grabbing Mo Er in front of him.

"Master Sword尊, please show mercy! For the sake of our long friendship, I don't know what he offended you. I'm willing to pay with my life if Master Sword尊 speaks!" Mo Dao finally couldn't bear it and shouted loudly.

"Pu..." Blood pierced Mo Er's chest, and a strong suction force spread from the sword. Roars echoed in people's ears, as if Mo Er's soul was screaming. Obviously, Mo Er had no chance of reincarnation.

"You..." Mo Dao looked at Mo Er's corpse with wide eyes. He almost couldn't believe it, but Fu Xingxuan hadn't taken his words seriously and had killed Mo Er with one sword.

"Did you have something to say?" Du Jianhang coldly looked at Mo Dao. Here, near the Sealing King City, although it wasn't far away, the means left by the Sealing King ancestors would be weakened. Otherwise, the Sealing King would have intervened to save Mo Er.

"No!" Mo Dao spoke solemnly. His face was red, and he felt oppressed but as Du Jianhang had thought, this wasn't the Sealing King City. He was no match for Du Jianhang.

"That's good!" Du Jianhang looked at Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan, who were recovering. He flew up and disappeared from Mo Dao's sight.

"Ah! Master Du Jianhang, I will definitely avenge this!" Watching Du Jianhang and others leave, Mo Dao finally couldn't control himself. He roared into the sky.

Du Jianhang and others didn't care about Mo Dao but quickly returned to the Wheel Turning Sect.

"Master Sword尊 and Master Fire尊 have also returned. The Eight Heavenly Kings of the Wheel Turning Sect are all back. Is something big about to happen?" The disciples of the Wheel Turning Sect looked respectfully as Du Jianhang led Luo Tian and others toward the Wheel Turning Sect.

They quickly arrived at the second-to-last level of the Wheel Turning Sect, where Black and White Kings were located.

Chapter 2498: Hell of Fire

In the dim hall, ghost fire surrounded it, giving a sinister feeling. In the hall stood over ten people—these were the backbone of the Wheel Turning Sect, with the weakest being at the early stage of the Heavenly King.

Black and White Kings sat in the center. On both sides were Jueying Heavenly King and Dujian Heavenly King, two early-stage Heavenly Kings. Four middle-stage Heavenly Kings, including Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan, and ten early-stage Heavenly Kings.

"Yu Tian has made it to the middle stage of the Heavenly King!" People exchanged glances and laughed among themselves. Some hadn't seen each other for a long time.

"Far behind, the fastest growth is still the Holy Son and Holy Daughter!" Yu Tian smiled upon hearing people's compliments but spoke humbly.

"That's true. In just a century, he rose from True Immortal to early-stage Heavenly King. The Holy Son and Holy Daughter will definitely be the pillars of our Wheel Turning Sect!" Upon hearing Yu Tian mention Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan, people praised them. As for Luo Tian's past as a celestial being, people had largely stopped caring.

"Everyone!" Just as people were bustling, Black and White Kings coughed slightly. Then they spoke softly, causing the hall to instantly quiet down. They knew that if Black and White Kings had no major matters, they wouldn't have gathered everyone here.

"We've discussed it among the masters. We're preparing to go to war!" Black and White Kings spoke softly, their voices not loud but carrying iron determination.

"To go to war? Against whom?" The people in the hall were confused. They didn't know what Black and White Kings meant by going to war.
