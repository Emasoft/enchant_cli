“Boy, you come with me. Let my daughter vent her anger and then I’ll release you. If I have to come get you myself, it won’t just be about venting!” Ding Yuanshan’s face showed impatience as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“You mean, since you’re here, you dare not touch me? If you weren’t here, would you just take me?” Luo Tian’s face bore a mocking expression as he spoke softly.

“Exactly. If you don’t come with me today, I’ll have people stationed here to wait for you all day. Unless you intend to stay in this inn forever, you won’t leave Lishui City!” Ding Yuanshan’s face showed surprise.

He could guess this young man was no ordinary person. Just by maintaining composure under his presence, a Body Refinement Stage nine could not have achieved this.

“Fine, I’ll go with you today. Let’s see what you can do to me!” Luo Tian wore an indifferent expression as he addressed Ding Yuanshan and Ding Xiaoyan.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Ding Xiaoyan’s face lit up with joy. That he would follow them was tantamount to having the courage of a bear and the heart of a leopard, akin to seeking death.

Ding Yuanshan’s brows furrowed slightly. He felt he was growing more and more unable to fathom this youth. There was only one scenario where someone would not fear the city lord’s mansion and himself: possessing an unshakable resolve against warnings from the city lord’s mansion and a formidable Bone-Devouring Peak cultivation. Both were indispensable.

After all, the Eastern Region was no match for the Northern Region. To become a city lord, one needed deep roots and formidable strength; Ding Yuanshan would not have attained this position otherwise.

The deeper Luo Tian’s gaze, the more perplexing Ding Yuanshan felt.

“Let’s go. I also wish to see what kind of den this Lishui City truly is!” Without waiting for Ding Yuanshan to speak, Luo Tian strode down the stairs with a hint of arrogance.

Seeing Luo Tian’s arrogant figure, Ding Xiaoyan was furious. Ding Yuanshan also had a grim expression; Luo Tian’s posture, with hands behind his back, made him and his daughter seem like servants trailing behind Luo Tian. How could this high-ranking city lord endure such treatment?

He clasped his hands toward the void, a look of reverence returning to his face: “Then I’ll take my leave. If the elder needs anything, just inform the city lord’s mansion; I shall spare no effort!”

Ding Yuanshan’s words echoed in the room, but they were met with only his own voice reverberating. The old voice that had spoken earlier seemed to vanish, as if it had never existed.

Luo Tian strode down the stairs. Seeing the old man at the counter and the attendant, he wore a puzzled expression. He guessed that the great power might be one of these two men, but he felt the old man was more likely.

The old man’s demeanor was too calm. Facing so many soldiers, he should not have shown such composure. However, Luo Tian dared not think too much or test further. His lips curled slightly as he mused: “This place would be a good shelter for guests!”

After thinking, he stepped out of the door under the soldiers’ astonished glances. To their further surprise, their lord followed behind.

Luo Tian quickly stepped out of the inn’s door, his face calm as he noted the name of this inn: Locked Moon Inn.

“What an interesting name!” Luo Tian murmured softly, unsure why he felt something was off about this inn. Yet the feeling eluded him.

“You’ve got guts, boy. Just for your bravery today, if you just bow and apologize, I won’t trouble you!” Ding Yuanshan’s face showed admiration as he spoke loudly.

“No, I must have him kneel before me!” Ding Xiaoyan’s face showed a grimace. It was no longer just about avenging her servant Ding Xiang. She had also suffered, though it was unrelated to Luo Tian. Yet she attributed everything to him.

Two long whips appeared in her hands, one in each hand. Spiritual energy surged upward, two attributes of spiritual energy attached to the whips. Ding Xiaoyan sneered: “Boy, since you’ve left this inn, it’s no longer your choice. Let’s see what strength you have to withstand my attack!”

As she spoke, the two whips resembled two swift serpents, coiling toward Luo Tian. Two distinct energies formed on the serpents.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, spiritual energy of gold infused into his feet. He dashed about, dodging the whips’ attacks with difficulty.

“Not bad, but this is just a warm-up. Ice-Fire Dragon Killing Technique!” Ding Xiaoyan’s face showed a sneer. Though she was slightly surprised by Luo Tian’s speed, seeing the faint golden light on his feet made her realize it was an attribute issue.

As Ding Xiaoyan’s words finished, the two whips in her hands grew several times longer. They let out a thunderous roar and transformed into two long dragons, one blue and one red, coiling toward Luo Tian.

“Can’t escape! Your speed is too fast!” Luo Tian’s heart jolted, his gaze focused on the two dragons rushing toward him.

“This whip technique is quite good. The attendant must have been cooped up for days, today let him play enough!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. Facing a technique comparable to an intermediate-level martial art, he showed no fear. He called out: “Rip-Heaven Spear!”

“Hum…” A cold light like lightning in the night, a soft humming sound arose. A long spear landed in Luo Tian’s hands.

Chapter 319: At a Disadvantage

Chapter 319: At a Disadvantage

As the Rip-Heaven Spear landed in his hands, Luo Tian felt a gentle warmth. A strong fire attribute energy rushed toward him. That bloodline power was even more intense, and he could feel the fierce power of the Rip-Heaven Spear and the aura of tearing everything on its tip.

“Good spear!” Ding Yuanshan’s deep eyes flashed a golden light as he marveled at the Rip-Heaven Spear.

At this moment, the Rip-Heaven Spear radiated a powerful aura. Its tip glowed with cold light. The metal body of the spear was unknown, but red patterns were clearer. Red spiritual energy spread around the spear’s body, emitting a dazzling red light.

Luo Tian felt the Rip-Heaven Spear's transformation. His face showed a hint of joy. He shook the spear, activating gold attribute spiritual energy to drive the Rip-Heaven Spear. Without hesitation, he launched a single move: Golden Snake Wild Dance.

“Hiss… hiss…” The spear transformed into a golden snake. Its tip became cold fangs, resembling a king of serpents. One could even see the faint contempt in the snake’s eyes as it approached the two dragons, one blue and one red.

The massive serpent body swept past. In a moment, it shattered the blue dragon. The snake’s head lunged toward the fire attribute spiritual energy dragon.

“Crack…” The temperature within a thousand zhang rose slightly. The fire attribute dragon was shattered by the golden snake, dispersing into fire attribute spiritual energy in the air.

“So strong?” Luo Tian was astonished at his own spear technique, his face showing disbelief. He hadn’t expected that using only the gold attribute spiritual energy could block Ding Xiaoyan’s technique.

“What kind of spear is this? The martial art used is so变态!” Ding Yuanshan’s face showed concern. As experienced as he was, he knew Luo Tian's spear technique was merely an intermediate-level martial art. However, after using it, it could rival a high-level martial art.

As Luo Tian and Ding Xiaoyan fought, more onlookers gathered. Seeing the golden snake like an emperor, people shivered.

To everyone’s surprise, the golden snake seemed unsatisfied. Its cold eyes glowed with a chilling light and flew toward Ding Xiaoyan, who stood there in shock.

Ding Xiaoyan was also shocked. She hadn’t expected her casual technique to be so easily blocked, and it even attacked her.

“Hmph!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered. Her hands moved, and a cold expression appeared on her face. She became like an ice block of ten thousand years.

“Freeze!” Cold mist rushed toward the golden snake.

The golden snake was frozen in plain sight. Ding Xiaoyan sneered, pointing her finger.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed. The golden snake over ten zhang long shattered in her finger’s touch, turning into a pile of ice shards.

“This Ding Xiaoyan is truly a genius. I see now, she’s not dual-element but ice and fire!” Luo Tian was stunned. This was the first time he had seen a body with an ice attribute.

While shocked, the Human King Seal was already cast. He became like a swift leopard, holding the Rip-Heaven Spear and charging toward Ding Xiaoyan fearlessly.

Seeing Luo Tian charge at her, Ding Xiaoyan sneered again: “A Body Refinement Stage nine with a gold attribute body. How dare you fight me? You’re seeking death!”

Ding Xiaoyan showed no fear, her whip transforming into a dragon again and swinging toward Luo Tian.

“Who is this? This boy must be crazy! Body Refinement Stage nine fighting a dual-element Bone-Devouring Peak beginner!” A Bone-Devouring Peak early-stage warrior in the crowd showed shock.

“Not to mention the disparity in strength, but even status is unequal! She’s the city lord’s daughter. And the city lord is right here. He still dares to act!” Another Bone-Devouring Peak early-stage warrior was also amazed.

“Miss Ding Xiaoyan, beat him!” Many people recognized Ding Xiaoyan. She was beautiful beyond compare, so in Lishui City, those who loved her could line up to the door. Seeing someone challenge Ding Xiaoyan and it being a Body Refinement Stage nine youth, they all mocked Luo Tian’s foolishness.

“Master, help Miss Ding Xiaoyan. She…” Maid Ding Xiang wore a worried expression as she softly called out to Ding Yuanshan.

Hearing Ding Xiang’s call, Ding Yuanshan didn’t respond but stared at her with a solemn face. His expression was serious: “Tell me, how did Miss Ding Xiaoyan come to have this grudge with this boy!”

“This…” Seeing Ding Yuanshan’s gloomy face, Ding Xiang didn’t know how to speak.

“Speak!” Ding Yuanshan saw her hesitation and knew there was something fishy. His voice turned serious.

Ding Xiang realized Ding Yuanshan might be truly angry and didn’t hide anything. She recounted the whole story from beginning to end.

“Nonsense!” Ding Yuanshan shouted, turning his gaze back to the fierce battle between the two.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s condition was bad. The pressure of dual-element Bone-Devouring Peak was too much. Although he wasn’t afraid of a regular Bone-Devouring Peak and sometimes even dominated them, this Ding Xiaoyan was completely different from a regular Bone-Devouring Peak. Especially that abnormal dual-element body made him struggle, constantly in a passive position.

With so many people around, Luo Tian couldn’t expose his Five Elements Body. Even the Soul-Stealing Seal he had used successfully before was frozen by that strange ice attribute, making him suffer. If it weren’t for the Rip-Heaven Spear’s upgrade, he might already be in a mess.

“Little girl, don’t push me!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, feeling extremely frustrated. Several times he wanted to use the Dragon Emperor’s Reverse Scale to unlock his seal, but he held back. After all, he could only use it three times a month. He feared that if he encountered something life-threatening later, he wouldn’t be able to unlock the seal and would die too冤.

“Push me how? Just a broken jade slip, do you think your father will save you? Do you think you’re a true disciple of the Yuling Sect or Tianjian Sect?” Ding Xiaoyan sneered again, her whip coiling toward Luo Tian.

But Luo Tian seemed not to see it. He stood still, his face serious, and his feet ready for the Sealing Heaven Step.

Chapter 320: Invitation

Chapter 320: Invitation

During the attack, Ding Xiaoyan saw Luo Tian not resisting. Her face showed more confidence: “What? A broken jade slip, do you think your father will save you? You think you’re a true disciple of the Yuling Sect or Tianjian Sect?”

“Why don’t you fight?” A Bone-Devouring Peak early-stage warrior who had marveled at Luo Tian’s boldness showed suspicion.

Although Luo Tian was in a disadvantaged position during their fight, it didn’t mean he had no fighting power. But Luo Tian’s current state clearly showed he wasn’t going to fight back.

“Hmph, fool. You still dare challenge Miss Ding? This is the best joke I’ve seen today!” People mocked, looking at Luo Tian with disdain.

Ding Yuanshan suspiciously held the jade slip in his hand. He had felt something was off with Luo Tian before. He could clearly sense a powerful explosive force within Luo Tian’s body, even if he touched it, it was quite challenging.

Without hesitation, he opened the jade slip. A few lines appeared in Ding Yuanshan’s view. Seeing those lines, his face turned pale: “Damn!”

At this moment, Ding Xiaoyan’s whip was about to strike Luo Tian’s chest. Her face showed a hint of joy. She knew this hit would not kill him, but he would definitely be injured.

Luo Tian stared intently at the approaching whip. His heart drummed. He was gambling, betting on his position in Ding Hongfei’s eyes and the weight of Ding Hongfei's words with Ding Yuanshan.

If he was important, at this close distance, with Ding Yuanshan’s Bone-Devouring Peak strength, he would definitely not let himself be harmed.

Of course, if it wasn’t important, then he could only expose the Sealing Heaven Step and unlock the Nirvana Dragon Seal to teach this arrogant woman a lesson. Let her know he wasn’t easy to mess with, then escape with Longbao.

Luo Tian believed in his gamble. Ding Hongfei was definitely a godlike figure within the Ding family. His words were edicts, and Ding Hongfei had already valued Luo Tian highly. So, Ding Yuanshan’s figure vanished from the spot.

Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. His face showed a mocking expression as he looked at Ding Xiaoyan. In his mind, Ding Yuanshan’s figure was like a gust of wind blocking in front of Luo Tian.

The whip sounded as if it had hit an iron plate. A strong aura blocked in front of Luo Tian, firmly grasping Ding Xiaoyan’s whip.

“Father!” Ding Xiaoyan saw the person and showed disbelief, shouting.

“Is that the city lord? What’s his intention?” People around rubbed their eyes in disbelief, watching Ding Yuanshan standing there.

They hadn’t expected the city lord to block an attack for someone who had challenged his daughter.

Ding Yuanshan’s face was extremely grim. He looked at Luo Tian, who wore a smile, with a slight blue bruise on his hand. Obviously, Ding Xiaoyan’s hit hadn’t harmed him, but it wasn’t pleasant either.

“Father! What are you doing!” Ding Xiaoyan finally couldn’t help but shout. She truly didn’t understand what her father was doing.

“Enough, stop it. Let’s just let this go!” Ding Yuanshan sighed at his daughter.

“Why!” Ding Xiaoyan asked in confusion.

“Because he is our guest, and a precious one. How can we attack guests? Let me explain the situation to you. This young man is not at fault! It was your mistake!” Ding Yuanshan’s face showed reprimand, glaring at Ding Xiaoyan. He sighed inwardly that his daughter was spoiled.

“This young man, today’s incident was our mistake. I hope you won’t take it to heart!” Ding Yuanshan turned around and carefully examined Luo Tian, his face showing a kind smile. This was completely different from the city lord who had been强势 in the inn.

“Elder, you’re too kind. It was just a misunderstanding. Moreover, I’m not hurt anywhere!” Luo Tian smiled back calmly.

“Guess this young man is new to Lishui City. How about staying at my mansion for a few days? Let me also show you hospitality!” Ding Yuanshan spoke again, inviting Luo Tian.

“Father! What’s wrong with you? I am your daughter. Why are you so polite to a stranger!” Ding Xiaoyan saw her father and that annoying youth talking and even calling each other brothers. Her heart was about to explode with anger, not understanding why her father had changed so much.

“Fool! I’ll deal with you later. Do you think this young man is afraid of you!” Ding Yuanshan saw his daughter arguing and scolded her with a serious face.

“Go home!” Before Ding Xiaoyan could argue, Ding Yuanshan shouted again.

“What’s going on? Did I not see correctly? Is this our city lord!” Several Body Refinement Stage soldiers saw Ding Yuanshan scolding Ding Xiaoyan, their minds filled with doubts.

Usually, if anyone harmed Ding Xiaoyan or she fought with someone outside, Ding Yuanshan would be the first to stand up for his daughter.

Today was different. First, he had politely stepped out of the inn, which they could understand since that elder was terrifying. But now this youth was clearly no match for his daughter, yet the city lord was being so polite to him. It wasn’t like the city lord’s usual behavior.

Knowing her father was truly angry, Ding Xiaoyan didn’t dare to defy too much. She glared at Luo Tian with gritted teeth and sneered: “Boy, don’t be too happy. I still said it, you will eventually kneel before me. Even if you have a strong background, it won’t help!”

“Ding Xiang, let’s go!” Ding Xiaoyan was so angry she didn’t even greet her father. She called out to Ding Xiang standing far away and strode off.

Seeing his daughter leave, Ding Yuanshan felt bitter. He wanted to ignore it but knew he couldn’t. Because the jade slip from Ding Hongfei had only a few words that revealed astonishing news: “Yuling Sect, three-element body. Take good care of him!”

Thinking about this young man being a genius from Yuling Sect, Ding Yuanshan couldn’t be careless. Although his family had some connections with the major sects, it was only a relationship of mutual benefit. It was more like a subordinate one.

Ding Yuanshan believed that if something happened to Luo Tian in Lishui City, Yuling Sect might send people to attack this city.

Chapter 321: The City Lord’s Mansion

Luo Tian could feel Ding Yuanshan's respect for him. He was secretly surprised. In the Eastern Region, sects had more status than in the Northern Region. Especially in secular cities, although there were experts of the Yuanling Stage, they still feared sects. After all, in the Northern Region, experts of the Yuanling Stage could support a second-rate sect.

“Elder, no need to be polite. I was impetuous before and did have some faults!” Luo Tian clasped his hands, his face still calm but his tone much better.

“Little brother doesn’t need to be modest. I know you must have hidden your strength, otherwise with my Bone-Devouring Peak father here, a regular Body Refinement Stage nine wouldn’t dare to attack my daughter in front of me!” Ding Yuanshan said meaningfully.

Hearing Ding Yuanshan’s words, Luo Tian was puzzled. He sighed inwardly: “It seems this Ding Yuanshan isn’t an easy person to deal with. I should quickly find out about the sects in the Eastern Region and leave before it’s too late. The longer I stay, the more likely I’ll expose myself.”

“Little brother, how about staying at my city lord’s mansion for a few days? Let me also show you hospitality!” Ding Yuanshan saw Luo Tian standing there without speaking and invited again.

“Then I’ll trouble you, elder!” Luo Tian was waiting for Ding Yuanshan’s invitation. When he finally came out, how could he refuse.

“Where is the trouble? If you consider me, just call me Uncle Ding!” Ding Yuanshan patted Luo Tian’s shoulder, his face showing admiration.

Ding Yuanshan had seen sect disciples before. None were as arrogant as these. But Luo Tian, coming from Yuling Sect which had a terrifying status in the Eastern Region, showed no arrogance at all. His favor for Luo Tian increased.

The soldiers around heard the city lord and youth’s conversation, their faces showing shock. In their eyes, the mighty city lord was being polite to a Body Refinement Stage nine youth, even giving his daughter no good face and somewhat favoring this youth.

Luo Tian didn’t want to offend Ding Yuanshan’s face. He smiled: “I suppose you don’t know my name yet. My name is Luo Tian. You can call me Brother Luo!”

“Luo Tian?” Ding Yuanshan heard Luo Tian’s name, his face showed confusion. Although the Eastern Region was thousands of miles away from the Northern Region, he had heard about a five-element genius named Luo Tian in the Northern Region. As a city lord with some status in the Eastern Region, he naturally had heard of it. He carefully examined Luo Tian.

But at this moment, Luo Tian had already changed his appearance. After examining for a while, he realized it wasn’t the person in the painting. He shook his head slightly.

“What’s wrong? Uncle Ding?” Luo Tian was also a bit nervous. He hadn’t expected to be known in the Eastern Region.

“Nothing, just that there was a five-element genius named Luo Tian in the Northern Region. His name is the same as yours!” Ding Yuanshan smiled and explained.

“Haha, I’ve heard of that Luo Tian in the sect. But the Northern and Eastern Regions are thousands of miles apart. I didn’t expect to share a name with him! That’s really coincidental!” Luo Tian laughed, saying.

“Yes. Well, there are countless people with the same name on Tianyuan Continent. It’s just a coincidence!” Ding Yuanshan continued.

“Indeed, I should meet this genius with the same name one day. Let’s see how strong that legendary five-element body really is!” Luo Tian smiled, his eyes showing eagerness as he spoke.

“Alright, it’s getting late. Let’s go to the city lord’s mansion and talk more!” Ding Yuanshan looked at the sky, wanting to leave.

Luo Tian nodded slightly. He called out to Wu Di who was stunned there, and together with Ding Yuanshan, they talked and laughed under the astonished glances of the crowd. They led a group of soldiers toward the city lord’s mansion.

Seeing their distant figures, people began to gossip: “Who is this kid? Is he a genius from a major sect?”

“You’re joking. Look at how he’s dressed. I think it’s just the city lord seeing his strength and wanting to recruit him!” People speculated, guessing Luo Tian's background.

In the Locked Moon Inn, a sigh echoed: “I guess I need to find another place. I have this feeling that this kid is a troublemaker. Don’t let him disturb my peace!”

...

Luo Tian and Ding Yuanshan were very harmonious as they arrived at the city lord’s mansion.

Upon entering the city lord’s mansion, Luo Tian felt it was no ordinary place. He had seen many cities in the Northern Region and entered numerous city lord’s mansions, but none could compare to this Lishui City's city lord’s mansion. Not only in size, but the spiritual energy concentration was much stronger than some second-rate sects in the Northern Region.

That night, Ding Yuanshan arranged a lavish banquet to entertain Luo Tian. They talked for a long time before arranging for Luo Tian to stay. However, no one from the Ding family came during the banquet, and Luo Tian didn’t see Ding Xiaoyan’s presence.

Luo Tian led Wu Di with the attendant to a spacious courtyard. He arranged for Wu Di to stay in a small room next to him, which was much larger than the small courtyard he had in the Five Elements Sect.

Luo Tian stayed in a spacious large room. As soon as he entered, he felt an empty sensation. This was uncomfortable for Luo Tian who had been accustomed to hardship.

But Luo Tian wasn’t too concerned about these things. He let the attendant leave and sat on the bed, thinking. He sorted out the information he had gathered from Ding Yuanshan during dinner.

“Ah, there are several major cities nearby. These cities will compete for a spot to trade with the sects in the next few days. It seems these cities have backgrounds, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to stay as city lords so calmly.” Luo Tian thought of the information Ding Yuanshan had mentioned.

“I hope the Ding family gets this spot. Then I can follow the traders back to the sects, which should give me a chance to enter those sects’ places.” Luo Tian murmured softly. This was the best plan he could think of.

“I wonder where the Tianshi Sect exists in the Eastern Region. If it’s convenient, destroying one or two of their bases would be good.” Luo Tian thought of Yang Huanyu’s figure. He could feel that Yang Huanyu was definitely fine in the explosion, but he didn’t know where Yang Huanyu had fallen.

Thinking of the Tianshi Sect, a shadow enveloped Luo Tian. A faint sense of urgency arose in his heart.

Chapter 322: Visiting

Chapter 322: Visiting

The next morning, sunlight woke Luo Tian. He opened his eyes and stretched, a smile on his face. He stepped out and saw Wu Di sitting in the courtyard with a serious expression, his body emitting a crisp sound.

“Promoted?” Luo Tian smiled. He had noticed Wu Di was at Body Refinement Stage five before, about to enter Body Refinement Stage six. He had given Wu Di some pills, and today he had just broken through.

“Indeed, he’s from Beichang County. His talent is average but his cultivation speed surpasses ordinary cultivators!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, a bold idea emerging from his mind.

“Elder…” Wu Di’s face showed excitement. He felt the spiritual energy outside was much stronger than in Beichang County, and he was secretly happy. According to his current speed, entering Body Refinement Stage nine would be imminent.

“Hmph, it’s not right. You should know my name now. Call me Luo Tian and just call me by my name!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, speaking softly.

“This can’t be done!” Wu Di shook his head like a drum.

“Since we’ve known each other for so long, you should understand my character. Now I give you two choices: one is to follow me and when I reach enough strength, I’ll help you avenge. The second is for me to give you enough resources and let you return alone to Beichang County, gradually building up from the outside until you reach Beiming City and personally avenge yourself!” Luo Tian’s face showed seriousness.

“This…” Wu Di’s face showed hesitation. He didn’t know what Luo Tian meant by this.

“Let me tell you the truth. Right now, your help isn’t much for me. Also, I’ll go to a very dangerous place in two days. It’s inconvenient to bring you along. So I’ll put you into the Naling and even then, there’s a chance of losing your life!” Luo Tian sighed and spoke honestly.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Wu Di trembled. After struggling for a while, his face showed determination: “Elder, I’ll go to Beichang County. I won’t disappoint you!”

After these days of coexistence, Wu Di knew what kind of people Luo Tian faced. He truly was too weak. Luo Tian wanted him to return to Beichang County and train, although the spiritual energy in Beichang County wasn’t very rich. However, this environment was extremely testing.

“Good!” Luo Tian showed admiration on his face. He knew this decision was difficult for Wu Di, but he believed that as long as Wu Di took one step at a time, his future would be boundless. Moreover, he had many advantages over others: his pills.

Luo Tian didn’t say more words. He placed a storage bag in Wu Di’s hands and spoke softly: “Inside this bag, there are enough pills to support you up to the Bone-Devouring Peak. There are also some weapons inside. How to handle it is up to you!”

Wu Di held the storage bag in his hands, his weak spiritual sense probed inside. Then his face was shocked. He had never seen so many pills before. Inside the storage bag, nearly a hundred jade bottles were neatly arranged. Wu Di was certain these pills would sell for sky-high prices in Beichang County.

Seeing Wu Di excited and speechless, Luo Tian patted his shoulder: “Alright, now you should leave. Remember to prioritize your life!”

“Okay!” Wu Di’s face showed a hint of fierceness. He no longer had that weak look, and he made a decision in his heart.

“Go! Beichang County. I’ll also return one day. After all, I was chased like a dog before. This grudge can’t be left unavenged!” Luo Tian’s face showed a coldness, his gaze looking north.

Wu Di bowed again. His figure left the courtyard with a determined expression, walking towards Beichang County.

Luo Tian watched Wu Di leave. He wasn’t sure if Wu Di would return to Beichang County, but he had an 80% chance that Wu Di would. These days of coexistence made him understand this dark-skinned man had something different from the people in Beichang County: gratitude and a strong desire for revenge.

Turning around, Luo Tian was about to leave when he heard the courtyard’s gate emit a thunderous sound.

“Ah, I see you’re called Luo Tian. You still dare to come to my house!” Ding Xiaoyan’s figure appeared at the front of Luo Tian's door, her face showing a grimace.

“Ah…”

Luo Tian patted his forehead and sighed inwardly. He had forgotten about this.

“Miss Ding, it was a misunderstanding yesterday. I suppose your father has explained it to you?” Luo Tian clasped his hands, smiling kindly.

“Go… there’s no misunderstanding between us. We haven’t finished yesterday yet. Today I’ll settle it all!” Ding Xiaoyan, her anger at its peak.

Yesterday, seeing her father helping a stranger, she had been angry for the first time in years. She stayed out all night and didn’t return home. Under Ding Xiang’s persuasion, she returned home but heard from the attendants that her father had brought this annoying person into their house. Her anger was unbearable, and she immediately went to find him here.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He wasn’t particularly annoyed with Ding Xiaoyan before; it was just normal arrogance. But now, this Ding Xiaoyan had gone too far.

“What do you want!” Luo Tian’s face turned cold. He was really fed up and had decided to unlock a seal, giving this spoiled girl a lesson.

Ding Xiaoyan was startled by Luo Tian’s cold gaze. However, recalling that yesterday she had easily dominated him and her father had saved him, she calmed down. She coldly replied: “Same as before. Kneel and apologize, and I won’t hold it against you!”

“Dream on. Don’t push me!” Luo Tian coldly replied.

“Boom…” As Ding Xiaoyan’s voice echoed, she moved. She didn’t want to waste words and rushed toward Luo Tian with a punch.

“Crack…”

Luo Tian tightly clenched his fists, his face showing cold light. His golden fist swung out.

“Step back…” Luo Tian took a few steps back, the Dragon Emperor’s Reverse Scale in his hand. He knew he couldn’t hold back anymore. The reverse scale slowly pressed onto his forearm.

“Last chance!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, taking out her whip again and fiercely whipping toward Luo Tian.

“This is what you’ve brought on yourself. Don’t regret it!” Seeing Ding Xiaoyan’s superior attitude, the last bit of hesitation in Luo Tian vanished.

However, just as the reverse scale was about to press onto his forearm, a娇笑 voice echoed: “Hey… who made our Ding Beauty unhappy?”

Chapter 323: Cities Arrive

Chapter 323: Cities Arrive

A娇笑 voice made Luo Tian stop. It also made Ding Xiaoyan pause, her face darkening. Her lips softly spoke a name: “Su Yeyu!”

Luo Tian retracted his reverse scale and wore a puzzled expression. His spiritual sense saw a slender woman walking from afar.

“Ding Beauty, it’s been a while!” A voice that made people feel酥麻 came from afar.

“Hmph! Su Yeyu, I didn’t expect you to be the first one here!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, looking at the figure approaching.

The figure entered. A voluptuous woman appeared before Luo Tian’s eyes, making him glance at her twice.

Luo Tian had seen many beautiful women before. Gu Qianxue, Ning Qingzhu, Leng Qiuchan, even Ding Xiaoyan was a beauty. But this was the first time he had seen such an alluring woman.

Dressed in a peony robe, her voluptuous figure was hidden. Her waist was slender, and where it should be prominent, it was. Every movement exuded a tempting charm.
