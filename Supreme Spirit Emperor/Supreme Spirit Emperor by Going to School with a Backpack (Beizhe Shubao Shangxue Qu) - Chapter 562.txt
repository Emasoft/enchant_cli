But it was unexpected that Luo Tian had resolved it himself, and in such a manner. This made Wang Gang finally regard Luo Tian as equal to them.

Moreover, the Demon King had previously sent a message stating that Luo Tian was likely backed by a powerful figure.

"Ha ha, when you go there, remember to call me!" Qiu Long also laughed heartily.

The Eight Heavenly Kings, although part of the Turn-Revolution Palace, would eventually leave it to inherit their fathers' Heavenly King positions.

But Luo Tian was different. Luo Tian had the Luo Family behind him, and it was likely he would remain within the Turn-Revolution Palace. Cultivating a good relationship with Luo Tian would help secure their positions.

"Little Brother Luo Chen, remember to come to my place tonight. I'll definitely reward you. It's time for you to demonstrate your true skills and prove yourself!" Su Dan spoke to Luo Tian, her eyes filled with seductive allure. Her words were unmistakably explicit.

"Such a siren!" Luo Tian felt overwhelmed, as Su Dan was simply too tempting. The alluring aura radiating from her made even a single glance cause one's blood to boil.

"Let's skip that..." Luo Tian sighed, watching two beams of violet light fall upon him, making him feel as if sitting on pins and needles.

"Let's settle the bet!" Fu Xingxuan finally spoke, her voice calm. The students of the Turn-Revolution Palace who had been inflamed by Su Dan's words instantly regained their composure.

Upon hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Zhang Tianhe and Ye Chen both trembled. Their gazes turned to Luo Tian, unsure how to proceed.

"I can't pay..." Luo Tian smiled bitterly and shook his head, gazing at Fu Xingxuan.

"So what do you suggest? None of these bets can be paid?" Fu Xingxuan's eyes sparkled with mischief before she quickly concealed it.

"Can't pay? If you can't pay, then why start the bet!" The students of the Turn-Revolution Palace erupted in anger, their gazes turning to Luo Tian.

On one hand, they were followers of Fu Xingxuan. On the other hand, they had lost too much and wanted to reclaim their bets.

The scene immediately became chaotic. Soon after, the elders entered, adding to the momentum and addressing Luo Tian.

"Boom..." As people clamored, a thunderous sound echoed in their ears. The battle platform suddenly rose and transformed into a streak of light, returning to Fu Xingxuan's pristine palm. She collected it.

"What are you all shouting about!"

"Since you can't pay, then your body must be the debt. From now on, you are mine!" Fu Xingxuan roared with authority.

"What?" Upon hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, everyone seemed to have not heard clearly. Their gazes turned toward Fu Xingxuan standing there.

Everyone's faces bore expressions of disbelief. They gazed at Luo Tian, thinking this was not a punishment but rather a reward. The phrase "paying with one's body" led them to imagine various scenarios.

"How cruel! You've been flirting with Su Dan, and now you have to follow the Holy Maiden, accompanying her constantly!" One after another, students shouted with discontent.

"From today on, you'll be responsible for cleaning the Ghost Feeding Hall of the entire Turn-Revolution Palace!" However, Fu Xingxuan's subsequent words caused people to wear mocking expressions.

"I said it before: in the Turn-Revolution Palace, don't offend an elder, but especially not the Holy Maiden. Once, a student offended the Holy Maiden and was immediately expelled from his soul by the Palace Master and thrown into the Yellow River of Hell!" People gazed at Luo Tian, their eyes filled with malicious joy.

"Thank you, Holy Maiden. I will certainly do my best!" Luo Tian smiled all the while, respectfully bowing to Fu Xingxuan. In his heart, he sighed; he would have to endure more suffering again. He had already experienced this in the Star Moon Clan.

"Disperse! Remember to clean thoroughly. If you don't, you won't have an easy time!" Fu Xingxuan addressed Luo Tian before flying into the entrance of the ninety-eighth level.

"Little Brother Luo Chen, you should come back in a few days. I don't like stinky little brothers!" Su Dan laughed, her eyes sparkling as she chased after Fu Xingxuan.

"Brother Luo, I bid you farewell!" Wang Gang and others smiled as they said goodbye to Luo Tian before flying toward their own residences.

"Ha ha, the Ghost Feeding Hall of the ninety-ninth level has been assigned to him!" People mocked and no longer mentioned reclaiming Luo Tian's debt. After all, Fu Xingxuan hadn't said anything, so they dared not approach Luo Tian to demand it.

Although Luo Tian was later slightly punished by Fu Xingxuan, becoming her follower, this did not hinder Luo Tian's brilliance.

Brilliant! Whether it was his physical combat against Qiu Long, or his speed contest with Hong Tao, or his sword duel with Wang Heng, and finally his battle against Mo Tian with the Eclipse Eye. Four victories in a row were enough to establish Luo Tian's name, making him the ninth Unofficial King of the Turn-Revolution Palace.

"Come on, you all have worked hard. Now it's time to divide the spoils!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Zhang Tianhe and Ye Chen.

Three days had passed since the bet was initiated. The two had put in a lot of effort. Luo Tian laughed heartily, leading them and the disciples Zhang Tianhe had found back to his courtyard on the ninety-ninth level.

When Zhang Tianhe placed each storage ring before Luo Tian, the entire courtyard was stunned. Everyone's breath quickened.

Each storage ring had its seals erased and piled up like a mountain, an absolute shock for anyone.

"Zhang Tianhe, take two parts; the others together take one part; Ye Chen, you take one part!" Luo Tian smiled lightly. He never hesitated to reward those who contributed.

"Thank you, Senior Brother Luo!" Zhang Tianhe and the others' faces immediately showed joy. The wealth given by Luo Tian was something they could never possess in their lifetime. Such resources were comparable to an entire clan.

"Alright, everyone focus on cultivation. Starting tomorrow, there will be many things to do. But strength is the fundamental!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed them, allowing everyone to take their share.

Zhang Tianhe and others left one by one. In the room, only Luo Tian and Ye Chen remained. Ye Chen was excited and also left the courtyard, breaking open each storage ring to begin fervently refining the endless ghost crystals.

Luo Tian did the same, without absorbing the ghost energy from the ninety-ninth level. Instead, he directly absorbed the ghost crystals. As for the lower-grade ghost weapons and spiritual herbs, Luo Tian merely sorted them out briefly due to their overwhelming number.

Time passed slowly. Seven days slipped by, and the cultivation of Luo Tian, Ye Chen, and Zhang Tianhe grew at an astonishing rate.

"Crack..." A cracking sound rose in Luo Tian's room. After seven days, he had completely consumed all the resources. The room echoed with a cracking sound, and the ground was littered with fragments. Dense ghost energy flowed through the room.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, filled with admiration. These seven days felt like he had achieved seven years of hard training.

"Consumed so much resources, yet I still couldn't break through to the late stage of True Immortal! Perhaps another round is needed before I can reach the late stage of True Immortal!" Luo Tian sighed deeply.

If it were an ordinary mid-stage True Immortal, they might have already broken through. However, the ghost energy Luo Tian required surpassed that of ordinary people.

Seven days ago, Ye Chen had entered the mid-stage True Immortal and stabilized his cultivation. His entire body radiated an astonishing aura, for Ye Chen was the top of Star River Mansion.

Luo Tian slowly stepped out of his room, seeing Ye Chen seated in meditation. A smile appeared on his face.

Seeing Luo Tian stepping out, Ye Chen immediately stood up, his gaze filled with admiration. He said nothing.

"Senior Brother Luo, you've emerged from your cultivation retreat, right? It's time to abide by the Holy Maiden's command!" A plump disciple stood outside the courtyard, addressing Luo Tian.

Chapter 2141: The Familiar Scent

Chapter 2141: The Familiar Scent

A black hall, with various ghostly creatures confined within. Outside the hall, a figure gazed at the filthy and repulsive objects with a wry smile.

"Such a familiar scent!" Luo Tian swung his iron shovel, continuously swinging it.

"Little girl, I'll spank your bottom!" Luo Tian kept shoveling while muttering.

Nearby, a plump figure stood there. This was Gui Qiuhai, a disciple of the Turn-Revolution Palace who managed the distribution of the Ghost Feeding Hall.

After Luo Tian's matches with the eight Heavenly Kings, Gui Qiuhai received a message from the Holy Maiden instructing him to find Luo Chen and bring Luo Tian to the Ghost Feeding Hall for cleaning.

Gui Qiuhai was immediately startled. Who was Luo Chen? He was someone who could defeat the eight Heavenly Kings, the Unofficial King of the Turn-Revolution Palace.

Gui Qiuhai had even placed a heavy bet on Luo Tian's loss, but he hadn't expected Luo Tian to turn the situation around.

Normally, Gui Qiuhai would have sought to befriend Luo Tian. However, he couldn't defy the Holy Maiden's will. Thus, Gui Qiuhai personally went to Luo Tian and brought him over.

Gui Qiuhai knew about Luo Tian's deeds. He was ruthless, killing even his own brother. He killed people on a whim if they disagreed with him.

Gui Qiuhai was terrified, fearing this man might kill him in a fit of rage. He wasn't the Holy Maiden and couldn't control Luo Tian, for the task given by the Holy Maiden was unbearable.

But Gui Qiuhai hadn't expected this fierce person, who even made the eight Heavenly Kings retreat in fear, to come over without hesitation.

Even more surprising was that this fierce person worked with remarkable skill and experience, as if he had done it before. However, this fierce person's words were rarely kind, often criticizing the Holy Maiden. If this spread, it would certainly provoke the anger of Fu Xingxuan's followers.

Gui Qiuhai dared not intervene, only praying that this ancestor would leave quickly. Thus, he didn't dare to leave and had to stay with Luo Tian, enduring the stench while cleaning layer by layer.

"Lochen really went to clean the Ghost Feeding Hall..."

"It seems even if he's an Unofficial King, he must fall under the Holy Maiden's authority!" Luo Tian's task of cleaning the Ghost Feeding Hall immediately caught the attention of the Turn-Revolution Palace disciples.

"Deserved! He set up a bet to take our resources, so having him clean the Ghost Feeding Hall is already cheap!" People immediately took joy in his misfortune. However, Luo Tian's fearsome reputation prevented them from daring to watch the spectacle as they had with the Star Moon Clan.

In the thirty-third level courtyard, Wang Gang wore a smile. A few days ago, he had relayed the news of Luo Tian's match against four Heavenly Kings to the Demon King City.

The Demon King was more concerned about the Luo Family, supporting them as the top family of the Demon King City and even preventing a clan-annihilation crisis from the Heavenly Demon King.

If it were usual times, the Demon King wouldn't have cared so much. Although he would still protect the Luo Family, he would definitely let them suffer a great loss.

At that moment, in the Demon King's residence, the Demon King wore a smile. Behind him stood an old man and a youth.

"Lie, you did well. This time when you go to the Turn-Revolution Palace, make sure to befriend this Luo Chen. Although your brother inherited my throne, I hope you can also establish a position within the Turn-Revolution Palace!" The Demon King spoke softly.

"Yes!" Wang Lie bowed slightly and followed the old man. They set off for the Turn-Revolution Palace.

"Ugh... thirty-third level!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, placing the shovel into the ground. After a day of shoveling, he had finished cleaning the Ghost Feeding Hall.

"Senior Brother Luo, there's more. The thirty-third level..." Gui Qiuhai approached Luo Tian with a wry smile, seeing him throw the shovel down.

"More? Are these levels also?" Luo Tian was momentarily speechless, feeling that Fu Xingxuan's girl truly had a heart of stone.

"Keep going!" Luo Tian sighed deeply and swung the shovel again, heading toward the entrance of the next level.

He stopped when he reached the third level because the following two levels were occupied by the eight deputy palace masters and the Palace Master.

"Next? Also go down?" Luo Tian asked Gui Qiuhai, his voice filled with confusion.

"Yes, you must go down!"

"But Senior Brother Luo, be careful. The next level's Ghost Feeding Hall is where the eight palace masters and the Palace Master keep their ghostly creatures. These ghosts are very powerful, so be cautious!" Gui Qiuhai spoke.

"Something's off. Xuan wouldn't let me risk my life, so there must be something fishy!" Luo Tian muttered to himself and stepped into the second level again.

Luo Tian had visited the second level multiple times, but each time he was directly transported there by the Sword Heaven尊 Du Jianxing to feel the sword peak. This was his first time walking down.

The second level was vast, completely occupied by eight large courtyards. In the center stood a towering black tower—this was the Ghost Feeding Hall of the eighth level.

As soon as Luo Tian appeared, the eight deputy palace masters knew of his presence. They had heard about Luo Tian's story.

"Kid, you really are something!" Du Jianxing smiled and watched Luo Tian's movements.

To reach the black tower, Luo Tian had to pass through two masters' courtyards: one was Fire Heaven尊 Yu Tian, and the other was Shadow Heaven尊 Cheng Bei. Both were at the early stage of Immortal King.

These two had been the ones who looked down on Luo Tian when he first arrived, wanting to take his Long Yuan Sword and make it the Turn-Revolution Palace's sacred treasure.

Luo Tian carefully approached the black tower. The first courtyard he passed was Yu Tian's. He clearly remembered the look in Yu Tian's eyes, as if looking down on him.

As soon as Luo Tian stepped through the gate, a sharp voice echoed in both his and Gui Qiuhai's ears.

Their faces instantly turned pale, feeling a powerful pressure pressing upon them.

"What are you two doing here sneakily?" A authoritative voice rang out, causing Luo Tian and Gui Qiuhai to freeze.

"Respectfully report to Fire Heaven尊, we are here under the Holy Maiden's command to clean the Ghost Feeding Hall for the masters!" Gui Qiuhai quickly spoke, his voice filled with respect.

"Oh?" Fire Heaven尊 Yu Tian's voice was puzzled. The pressure on Luo Tian and Gui Qiuhai disappeared.

"Go ahead!"

Fire Heaven尊 Yu Tian's voice rang out again, allowing Luo Tian and Gui Qiuhai to sigh in relief.

The rest of the journey was smooth. Since Yu Tian had questioned them, others naturally heard it. And Yu Tian never appeared throughout.

Luo Tian and Gui Qiuhai smoothly reached the front of the black tower, gazing at its towering height.

"Senior Brother Luo, this tower has nine levels. Each deputy palace master has one level. Each level houses a ghostly creature of the masters, and they are powerful. I heard that the ninth level houses a ghostly creature regarded as the Turn-Revolution Palace's foundation!"

"The Palace Master himself is an Unseen Ghost, so the Turn-Revolution Palace is also one of the most ghostly places in hell!" Gui Qiuhai explained to Luo Tian, introducing the nature of the ghosts from levels one through eight.

"Senior Brother Luo, only one person can enter. Take this token; the ghosts inside won't attack you!" Gui Qiuhai smiled and waved his hand, handing a token to Luo Tian.

"Okay, wait outside for me. When I come out, we'll go back together!" Luo Tian nodded and hung the token on his waist. His eyes showed a serious expression as he gazed at the black door, carrying the shovel and entering the black tower.

As soon as Luo Tian entered the tower, his vision darkened. After adapting for a while, he could see the interior.

"Roar..." As soon as Luo Tian appeared, a roar echoed in his ears. Next moment, a black light appeared behind him.

A large black head with horns, thick limbs, and scales all over its body. Before Luo Tian could react, he felt a wetness on the back of his head and instinctively shivered. He turned around and punched the large black head.

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed, and Luo Tian was thrown backward. His face showed shock.

"Moo..." The bull-like sound echoed, and the large eyes of a copper bell appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

His eyes showed anger, but Luo Tian didn't sense any hostility from the large eyes. His face awkwardly smiled.

"A ghost creature of the half-Immortal King stage..." Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed, recalling what Gui Qiuhai had introduced about the first level ghost creature and who it was.

"Chunshi Heaven尊's Bull-Headed Ghost, with infinite strength and a gentle nature!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the large head before him.

"Sorry..." Luo Tian smiled and extended his hand. A ghost-feeding pill appeared in his hand, a smile on his face.

"Ugh..." As soon as Luo Tian produced the ghost-feeding pill, the bull-headed ghost's breathing quickened. Without hesitation, it extended its tongue and swallowed the ghost-feeding pill in Luo Tian's hand.

"Moo..." The bull-headed ghost called out again, its eyes filled with longing as it gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 2142: The Final Level

"Moo..." The eager bull-like sound echoed in the dark hall. Luo Tian wore a smile.

A ghost creature of half-Immortal King stage, its mind was no different from humans. Luo Tian knew it could understand him.

"Okay, here you go!" Luo Tian smiled and waved his hand. He threw two more ghost-feeding pills in front of the bull-headed ghost, which immediately devoured them.

"No more. I'll bring you some tomorrow!" Luo Tian spoke to the bull-headed ghost, patting its large head. He hadn't expected this big creature to be so interested in the ghost-feeding pills.

"Moo..." The bull-headed ghost called out, nodding its head. It allowed Luo Tian to walk towards other parts of the hall.

Luo Tian quickly cleaned the entire hall. With the bull-headed ghost's reluctant gaze, he moved to the second level. As soon as he entered the second level, Luo Tian became tense because of Gui Qiuhai's words. This second level housed Fire Heaven尊 Yu Tian's ghostly creature, an eight-headed snake.

As Luo Tian entered the second level, a smile appeared on Yu Tian's face in his courtyard.

"If he accidentally dies in the Ghost Feeding Hall, it won't be my fault!" Yu Tian muttered to himself and issued a command.

"Buzz..." Cold energy instantly filled Luo Tian's mind, causing his face to slightly change. He quickly raised the token Gui Qiuhai had given him.

"Snort..." Sixteen cold lights appeared, and a massive creature instantly appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

Luo Tian suddenly turned around. A black light immediately appeared where he had stood.

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed, and Luo Tian's heart jumped to his throat. His eyes flashed with purple light as he gazed at the massive creature.

Eight large black snake heads, cold eyes staring at Luo Tian. If he compared glances with this creature, he would surely be stared to death. Its aura was also at the half-Immortal King stage.

"I'm here to clean your room!" Luo Tian spoke, gazing at the eight-headed snake. He had no desire to fight.

Although it was a ghostly creature cultivated by humans, it was still at the half-Immortal King stage. Luo Tian, despite his strength, was only at the mid-stage True Immortal.

"Snort..." Red snake tongues continuously extended. One large snake head suddenly lunged toward Luo Tian, biting.

The fangs glowed with cold light. Luo Tian didn't believe his physical body could withstand this snake's bite, and he would be swallowed by it.

"Fire Heaven尊, your grandmother!" Luo Tian cursed loudly. He clapped his hands and the Soul-Controlling Seal instantly flew from his head. Three dogs and Erhei also appeared beside him.

"Roar..." The three dogs immediately returned to their massive forms, standing by Luo Tian's side. They cautiously watched the eight-headed snake and pressed a palm toward its large head.

The Soul-Controlling Seal, along with the three dogs and Erhei's unique suppression aura over ghostly creatures, instantly descended upon the eight-headed snake. The snake head that had rushed toward Luo Tian paused slightly.

"Wang Wang..." Erhei transformed into a streak of light and lunged toward the snake head, biting it.

"Boom..." The black Soul-Controlling Seal and the three dogs' paws heavily pressed upon that large head. A dull sound echoed in the dark hall.

The black snake head was instantly pressed down, and Erhei also bit off a piece of the snake's flesh. Then it was immediately thrown back by the black snake head.

"Boom..." The Soul-Controlling Seal and three dogs didn't stop the snake's attack. They only gave Luo Tian a chance to escape. As soon as he disappeared, the black snake head immediately bit down.

"There's no way to play with you!" Luo Tian cursed in his heart. He extended his hand, and a ghost-feeding pill appeared in his hand. He had no choice but to use it since he couldn't match the eight-headed snake.

"Snort..." Sixteen beams of divine light looked at Luo Tian's ghost-feeding pill, their eyes filled with eagerness.

"Useful..." Luo Tian noticed the eight-headed snake's greed and felt happy. He hadn't expected the ghost-feeding pill to attract these cultivated ghostly creatures so much.

"You want to eat it, don't kill me. Otherwise, you won't get it!" Luo Tian spoke. He knew the eight-headed snake could understand him.

"Snort..." The eight-headed snakes understood Luo Tian's words and nodded their heads. Their eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

Although Yu Tian had given him the command to kill this person, the ghost-feeding pill's temptation was great enough for it to defy Yu Tian's command.

"Eat!" Luo Tian sighed deeply and extended his hand. The ghost-feeding pill transformed into a streak of light, flying toward the eight-headed snake.

The black pill was immediately swallowed by the eight-headed snake. The snake's eyes showed satisfaction and continued to gaze at Luo Tian.

"Yu Tian, today I've made you lose the chicken but gain nothing. I'll make these eight-headed snakes obey me!" Luo Tian knew this was Yu Tian's trick, his eyes showing a fierce expression. He then waved his hand again and another ghost-feeding pill appeared in his hand, but this one had a bit of the Soul-Controlling Seal's energy infused into it.

Luo Tian didn't dare to infuse too much, as the eight-headed snakes had a half-Immortal King's strength. If he infused too much, it might trigger the eight-headed snakes' vigilance.

The eyes of the eight-headed snakes showed confusion. They instinctively felt this was different from before, but they couldn't resist the temptation and swallowed it.

"Swallowed!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly brightened. He released another ghost-feeding pill, which was also swallowed by the eight-headed snakes.

"One... two..." Luo Tian continuously threw ghost-feeding pills. The eight-headed snakes accepted them without hesitation, and their bodies emitted a series of booming sounds. Their eyes were also excited because as they continued to consume the ghost-feeding pills, their bloodlines gradually strengthened. If they reached a certain level, they might break free from their constraints and become true ghostly creatures capable of forming human forms.

After thirty ghost-feeding pills were fed to the eight-headed snakes, Luo Tian's eyes gradually became excited.

"It worked!" Thirty Soul-Controlling Seal energies were circulating within the eight-headed snakes. If Luo Tian activated them, he could completely control the eight-headed snakes by combining thirty seals.

However, Luo Tian didn't do this. First, he was afraid Yu Tian would discover it and become furious, possibly even directly killing him.

"I don't have many pills left. I'll come back tomorrow!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with a smile.

"Snort..." The eight-headed snakes nodded and didn't continue to attack Luo Tian. They allowed him to clean the hall.

"Indeed, it's powerful! I never thought you could change a ghostly creature's bloodline!" Yu Tian stood in his courtyard, hearing the joy returned by the eight-headed snakes. His face also showed amazement.

"So I'll wait until you completely change my eight-headed snakes' bloodline before killing you!" Yu Tian's face showed a cold smile, muttering to himself.

"This is what you forced me to do!" Luo Tian finished cleaning and, with the eight-headed snakes' reluctant gaze, collected the three dogs and Erhei. He moved toward the third level.

This time, Luo Tian's journey was smooth. This level housed a horse-faced ghost. He only gave it one ghost-feeding pill, but he also added the Soul-Controlling Seal's mark.

"Fourth level... fifth level..." Luo Tian cleaned layer by layer, eventually reaching the eighth level.

"Indeed powerful! There are two Immortal King early-stage ghostly creatures!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, standing in the eighth level. A black figure stood beside him—each of the seventh and eighth levels housed one Immortal King early-stage ghostly creature.

It was a black phoenix, but this phoenix had nine heads. Its name was the Nine-Headed Bird, and it resided in the eighth level.

"Gurgle..." The nine-headed bird made a series of gurgling sounds, calling out to Luo Tian. Its powerful aura caused Luo Tian to feel shocked.

"Is this the entrance to the ninth level?" Luo Tian gazed at the altar with swirling black energy, a smile on his face.

"Never enter the ninth level!" Gui Qiuhai had previously told Luo Tian. The ninth level housed the Turn-Revolution Palace's sacred ghostly creature, and those who had entered never returned.

"If I'm not mistaken, Xuan must want me to enter the ninth level!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. After hesitating, he still stepped onto the altar. He believed Fu Xingxuan wouldn't harm him.

"Buzz..." Waves of energy passed through Luo Tian's body. The transmission power activated, and Luo Tian's figure disappeared from the eighth-level hall.

"Rippling..." The sound of waves passed through Luo Tian's ears, but he continued to transmit. After leaving the transmission, Luo Tian appeared in a strange space.

Yellow rivers surged endlessly, flowing from nowhere and disappearing into nowhere. In the yellow river were countless souls, drifting with the current.

A gray bridge stood over the yellow river. If one looked closely, it was built from countless soul energies.

Around the bridge were endless white flowers blooming on both sides, impossible to count—these were the Ferry Flowers.

Soul energies in the yellow river drifted under the Ferry Flowers, absorbing some soul energy as nourishment to sustain the flowers' growth.

On the gray bridge stood a silhouette in black clothes. As Luo Tian descended from the sky, one of the Ferry Flowers rose from the yellow river and suddenly expanded to catch Luo Tian.

"Too beautiful!" Luo Tian gazed at the countless Ferry Flowers descending from the sky, his face showing awe.

"Yellow River!" The next moment, Luo Tian was stunned. He gazed at the surging yellow water with disbelief.

The white Ferry Flowers landed on the gray bridge. Luo Tian also stood on the bridge, and as soon as he steadied himself, a hot figure appeared before him. It immediately wrapped around Luo Tian's waist.

"Little girl!" Luo Tian smiled and didn't hesitate, pressing his lips against the hot one.

Chapter 2143: Bathing

Chapter 2143: Bathing

On the gray bridge, even with the black veil covering her face, Luo Tian could feel the heat of the woman in his arms. He almost lost control, and both of them finally let go.

Luo Tian looked at the woman in his arms with affection, a smile on his face. His eyes showed tenderness.

"No one can see us here!" Fu Xingxuan leaned against Luo Tian's chest, smiling.

"Yes." Luo Tian nodded and then released Fu Xingxuan. He gazed at the endless Ferry Flowers below, expressing admiration.

"Where is this?" Luo Tian asked. This was his first time seeing such a magnificent scene.

"You guess!" Fu Xingxuan removed her veil, revealing her beautiful face. This made Luo Tian's lower abdomen heat up.

"I can't guess. Tell me, or I'll spank your bottom!" Luo Tian smiled mischievously and pulled Fu Xingxuan closer.

"Little girl, make your husband clean those things. I'll definitely punish you today!" Luo Tian laughed heartily and repeatedly hit Fu Xingxuan, causing her to cry out in surprise.

After a while of playfulness, Fu Xingxuan was flushed and begged for mercy from Luo Tian. She had to escape from Luo Tian's grasp because the places he hit were too sensitive.

"This is the Reincarnation Hell!"

"This river is naturally the Yellow River. These souls are those of people who have reincarnated. I am here to absorb their memories through the Ferry Flowers!"

"However, some people with talent are taken into the Turn-Revolution Palace by Immortal Kings. They are bound by the heavens and earth, using heavenly energy to form a body, becoming disciples of the Turn-Revolution Palace!" Fu Xingxuan smiled and gazed at the drifting souls.

Upon hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Luo Tian was stunned. He gazed at the Ferry Flowers and had never heard such a concept before.

This Yellow River spans across the entire hell. These souls are erased of their memories here and then proceed to the next level of hell until they pass through eighteen levels of hell, entering reincarnation and becoming human again.

"Understood. Then where is the end of reincarnation?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion.

"No one knows. Not even the ten palace masters know where the end of reincarnation is. No one dares to enter the end of reincarnation, for it might lead to another reincarnation!"

"The existence of the Ten Yama Palaces seems to guard this Yellow River, ensuring that reincarnation proceeds normally. Because of this guardianship, the Ten Yama Palaces exist!"

"The Ten Yama Palaces, with their increasing strength, wanted to break free from this prison. Hence the battle against the celestial realm. It's also because of guarding the eighteen levels of hell that the Ten Yama Palaces' strength was constrained!" Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, continuously introducing to Luo Tian. She also explained her experiences over the years.

They sat on the gray bridge, sharing their stories with each other.

Originally, when the spiritual path shattered, they had already died and entered reincarnation. However, while drifting with the Yellow River to the Turn-Revolution Palace, they were mysteriously sucked into a Ferry Flower and successfully fused with it. That Ferry Flower was none other than the mother of the Ferry Flowers Luo Tian had been searching for.

This incident was discovered by the two palace masters, Hei Bai Wu Chang and Bai Hui. They immediately designated Fu Xingxuan as the Holy Maiden of the Turn-Revolution Palace and had her reside in this Reincarnation Hell.

Fu Xingxuan had once secretly left to find some old friends and bring them into the Turn-Revolution Palace. This led to her being chased by Luo Bai, and she returned to the Turn-Revolution Palace.

Upon returning, Hei Bai Wu Chang and Bai Hui were furious. They immediately confined Fu Xingxuan, waiting for her injuries to heal before directly destroying the Luo Family.

Fu Xingxuan's injuries had just healed. When she came out, she was told by the two palace masters that Luo Bai had died and that the one who killed Luo Bai, Luo Chen, was now in the Turn-Revolution Palace. Fu Xingxuan came out to check and saw Luo Tian's battle against several Heavenly Kings.

"Close call. You've worked hard..." Luo Tian's heart trembled, filled with concern and affection. He gently pulled Fu Xingxuan into his arms. If it weren't for the mother of the Ferry Flowers, Fu Xingxuan might have been erased of her consciousness and entered reincarnation.

Fortunately, the two palace masters didn't immediately order the destruction of the Luo Family. Otherwise, he might have also suffered alongside the Luo Family.

"It's okay now. Now my strength is higher than yours, and my position is also above yours!" Fu Xingxuan smiled softly. Her eyes showed tenderness, comforting Luo Tian not to feel guilty.

"The mother of the Ferry Flowers!" Luo Tian gazed at Fu Xingxuan, his face showing a wry smile. He never expected that the mother of the Ferry Flowers he was searching for was Fu Xingxuan.

This made Luo Tian a bit troubled. Zhang Ziping's life needed the mother of the Ferry Flowers to save, but Luo Tian couldn't bring Fu Xingxuan to Buxian City. Also, he could never hand Fu Xingxuan over to Jiang Chen of Buxian City, that scoundrel.

"Relax. Take a drop of my essence blood back and it should be enough to save your brother!" Fu Xingxuan noticed Luo Tian's dilemma. Her face showed a smile.

"Yes, that's the only way. If it doesn't work, we'll find another method!" Luo Tian sighed deeply.
