Ko Duanshan still held a golden long sword in his hand, with the black-armored soldiers standing behind him, followed by numerous common soldiers.

"Let's go!" Zhang Ziping smiled slightly on his face, feeling a touch of nostalgia as he leapt into the air, flying toward the center of the military camp.

"Fifty years, I've been here for fifty years. Now that I'm leaving, it's truly hard to part!" Tian Fu looked sorrowful.

Chapter 2221: Business Has Arrived ()

In the center of the Eighth Army, soldiers stood there solemnly, their eyes filled with reverence as they gazed at Zhang Ziping and Tian Fu.

"If anyone bullies you on Mount Btian, send word. You will always be soldiers of Btian City, and the Eighth Army will forever be your support!" Ko Duanshan shouted loudly, his voice tinged with emotion.

"Yes!" Zhang Ziping and Tian Fu stood straight, their gazes filled with respect for Ko Duanshan. They could find no fault in him—a typical soldier, a regiment commander, a commander they respected deeply.

"Boom..." The Btian City cultivators roared lowly, clenching their fists and pounding their chests, producing a dull sound.

"Go! Brothers, I hope we meet again on Mount Btian!" Tian Fu laughed heartily, his eyes slightly moist as he leapt into the air with Zhang Ziping, landing on the vast altar.

"Buzz..." Waves of energy rose as Zhang Ziping and Tian Fu vanished from sight. As they left, many people's faces showed excitement.

"The position of Thousand-Commander Tian Fu is now vacant!" People whispered among themselves, believing this post might be occupied by a True Immortal at the peak or transferred from another regiment.

"This position of Thousand-Commander, I will claim it!" Xue Zilong's eyes flashed with determination. Though he had previously been dethroned by Luo Tian as Thousand-Commander, Xue Zilong's strength remained formidable.

Thinking of this, Xue Zilong leapt into the air toward the direction of Tian Fu's residence. To vie for the Thousand-Commander position, one had to start from Tian Fu's former residence—those who could occupy the courtyard would become the future Thousand-Commander.

It wasn't just the Eighth Army that trembled; other regiments were also excited, as this position was crucial for the entire Btian City. Thus, anyone qualified from other regiments could also become Thousand-Commander.

Xue Zilong's speed was astonishing; others who felt they had the qualifications also rushed toward Tian Fu's courtyard. Everyone knew that during these days, Tian Fu's courtyard would certainly not be tranquil.

"I was the first! I want to see who dares challenge me!" Xue Zilong's eyes flashed coldly as he stood at the courtyard gate.

"Ugh... everyone, move out! Brother Tian Fu really is a pain—he left and even left all this stuff behind. I have to move it..." But just as Xue Zilong stood at the courtyard gate, preparing for a battle, loud noises echoed from within the courtyard.

"Excuse me, please move aside! Oh, isn't this General Xue Zilong, the one who lost to me?" The courtyard gate opened, and a voice echoed in Xue Zilong's ears.

A golden cart slowly moved forward, Luo Tian sitting on a cart crafted by Lei Yonggang, smiling as he stepped out of the courtyard gate.

Behind Luo Tian stood sturdy figures, their mouths twitching—these were all Tian Fu's former subordinates.

Before leaving, Tian Fu had entrusted his followers to Luo Tian. Though they said nothing, suddenly switching leaders was somewhat uncomfortable for them.

What no one expected was that Luo Tian's first command was to have them raid Tian Fu's home.

The people were thoroughly impressed by Luo Tian's terrifying nature, like locusts devouring everything—even the mouse hole in Tian Fu's house was dug out.

At that moment, Tian Fu's courtyard was completely empty, even the houses had been torn down, and bricks were dismantled.

"This..." As the gate opened, Xue Zilong saw the scene within the courtyard and was speechless, his gaze filled with disbelief as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, what have you done!" Xue Zilong's breath quickened. In his mind, Tian Fu's departure meant he was the most likely candidate to become the next Thousand-Commander. This courtyard would be his Xue Zilong's.

But Xue Zilong hadn't expected Luo Tian to have already led people to tear down Tian Fu's courtyard, leaving nothing behind.

"Nothing much—Brother Tian Fu left, and he entrusted everything to me. Naturally, I must safeguard it for Brother Tian Fu!" Luo Tian spoke softly, never feeling the slightest shame.

"Destitute..." At this moment, Luo Tian could only describe himself with one word—poor. He would never miss any opportunity to exchange battle merits.

"Damn bastard..." Xue Zilong gritted his teeth, seeing Luo Tian still seated on the cart. His heart filled with resentment, but he didn't dare to act rashly. He had truly been terrified by Luo Tian's previous foot strike, and without full confidence, Xue Zilong would never dare to confront Luo Tian.

"Go on, brothers!" Luo Tian laughed heartily and addressed those behind him. The cart moved forward as he headed toward his own courtyard. Now, people were focused on the vacant position of Thousand-Commander Tian Fu, so no one paid much attention to Luo Tian.

The group quickly arrived at Luo Tian's courtyard, where figures stood there in disarray.

"Brother Tian Fu was really foolish—he entrusted us to this crippled Thousand-Commander. Perhaps he would be dethroned at any time!" The people whispered among themselves, clearly dissatisfied.

"I say we should all go our separate ways or directly kick this kid down and take the position ourselves!" A middle-aged man spoke, his voice filled with disdain.

"Yes, General Wang Chuan is right! I also feel this crippled one will surely be dethroned!" Many captains echoed his words.

"Xinghua, Starlight Brother is about to reach the peak of True Immortal; I believe he's most suitable!" Wang Chuan looked at the middle-aged man beside him, his eyes filled with a hint of amusement.

"Don't speak nonsense. Brother Tian Fu entrusted us to General Luo Tian, so we must obey Brother Tian Fu's will. Soldiers regard obedience as their highest virtue!" Sun Xinghua furrowed his brows slightly, but his eyes showed a flicker of interest.

Sun Xinghua had followed Brother Tian Fu for years and was powerful. He originally thought that after Brother Tian Fu left, the position of Thousand-Commander would naturally be given to him.

But Sun Xinghua hadn't expected Brother Tian Fu to entrust these people to Luo Tian. After all, this was a place where strength ruled. If Luo Tian were strong, it would be fine.

Now, Luo Tian's display had given people the impression of a crippled man—how could he command respect?

However, Sun Xinghua was just like the others; he deeply feared Luo Tian's act of slaying the late True Immortal Jiang Baochao. It was too terrifying.

"Very lively! What are you discussing?" As the people whispered among themselves, Luo Tian walked in with his group, smiling as he looked at them.

"Big Brother!" Ye Liangchen quickly approached Luo Tian, his eyes filled with suppressed frustration. He and Huo Zhen and Zhang Desheng had been in the courtyard all along; Wang Chuan's words were not hidden from them, so they had heard everything clearly.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, seeing Ye Liangchen's expression. His mind heard Ye Liangchen's voice.

"Business has arrived!" Hearing Ye Liangchen's words, Luo Tian's face turned pale. He coughed lightly, spitting out two mouthfuls of black mist and blood.

Luo Tian's display didn't matter, but Wang Chuan and another thousand-commander's faces immediately showed disdain. They believed the rumors that Luo Tian had suffered heavy injuries in Demon Mountain were true.

With his legs crippled and severe, irreversible wounds on his body, what qualifications did this man have to be their leader? Wang Chuan and the other thousand-commander thought coldly, looking at Sun Xinghua. Seeing the flicker of interest in Sun Xinghua's eyes, Wang Chuan spoke loudly: "Thousand-Commander, Brother Tian Fu entrusted us to you. Naturally, we must obey him. But everyone knows that the Eighth Army and even the entire Btian City are ruled by strength."

"To secure your position, you must have strength!" Wang Chuan spoke, his gaze directly at Luo Tian.

"Cough cough! Are you trying to test my strength?" Luo Tian coughed twice more, wiping the blood from his lips. A flicker of fear flashed in his eyes.

"He's afraid of me!" Luo Tian's gaze was instantly caught by Wang Chuan, as well as Sun Xinghua and another thousand-commander.

"Yes, otherwise these three thousand brothers would not have obeyed us!" Wang Chuan laughed coldly, his gaze challenging Luo Tian.

"Alright, I know you all don't respect me. Then let's do it the normal way—sit here and let you challenge me. Whoever wins, the position of Thousand-Commander is theirs!" Luo Tian addressed the group.

"Big Brother really is a trickster, setting up all this and even calculating his own people's battle merits!" Ye Liangchen stood beside Luo Tian, sighing inwardly.

"Good! General Luo Tian truly has a bold spirit!" Wang Chuan immediately laughed heartily, his gaze turning to Sun Xinghua.

"Starlight Brother, this is such a good opportunity; now that it's come, you can't refuse!" Wang Chuan looked at Sun Xinghua, and the other thousand-commanders also gazed at him.

"Old Wang, don't be foolish. Brother Tian Fu just left; doing this now isn't good!" Sun Xinghua thought for a moment and refused.

"Starlight Brother, what are you still afraid of? Let me challenge first; let's see what strength General Luo Tian currently has!" Wang Chuan laughed heartily and stood opposite Luo Tian.

"I, Wang Chuan, challenge General Luo Tian!" Wang Chuan spoke loudly, his gaze at Luo Tian. At the same time, a barrier rose again, and those within the barrier were squeezed out.

Wang Chuan's wrist had lost five million battle merits, which made Luo Tian's face show a slight smile.

"If only ten or eight people challenged me every day, I could pay off my debts within a month!" Luo Tian thought to himself, still sitting on the cart.

"General Luo Tian, I heard you suffered heavy injuries. I advise you to surrender; after all, we are both late True Immortals. It's not good for either of us to fight!" Wang Chuan spoke softly, believing Luo Tian was merely enduring.

"Buzz..." As Wang Chuan's words just finished, a black sword beam suddenly rose and slashed toward Wang Chuan.

Chapter 2222: Suppression ()

The black greatsword slammed down, directly striking Wang Chuan's body. Wang Chuan's face still wore a triumphant expression; at the moment the sword fell, everyone's faces suddenly changed.

"Indeed, he still has strength!"

"No, this sword's power is strong but definitely can't kill Wang Chuan! His strength has truly weakened!" Several thousand-commanders showed surprise, watching Wang Chuan being struck.

Wang Chuan initially shivered; if he had prepared, he could have blocked Luo Tian's sword.

But Wang Chuan was immediately intimidated by his mind, instinctively recalling Luo Tian's one sword strike that had killed Jiang Baochao.

"Boom..." The black greatsword fiercely struck Wang Chuan's body, and Wang Chuan was directly sent flying. Blood continuously spewed from his mouth, and he fell to the ground in a pitiful heap, his back caved in.

When Wang Chuan tried to stand up again, a golden cart suddenly appeared; the long sword hovered in the air. Luo Tian appeared beside Wang Chuan, his sharp sword pointing at him.

"Cough cough..." At the same time, Luo Tian also spat out a mouthful of blood, which landed on Wang Chuan's face. His face was even paler now.

"You've lost..." Luo Tian spoke while coughing, appearing extremely weak.

"I..." Wang Chuan's face showed resentment, but he knew he had lost. However, it was due to carelessness and being ambushed by Luo Tian.

"You what? No one wins without tricks! You've lost!" Ye Liangchen laughed heartily, his voice filled with disdain.

Wang Chuan sneered and stood up but didn't lose heart; he was surrounded by people who began to recover his cultivation.

Wang Chuan's mind coldly smiled; although he had been injured, he had probed Luo Tian's secrets. That is, Luo Tian had suffered heavy injuries. Although that sword was strong, Luo Tian had also spat blood after striking it.

"Starlight Brother, you should act now; you've seen his condition. Clearly, he's no longer as strong as before. And his legs are crippled; if you're careful enough, you can definitely defeat him!" Wang Chuan spoke to Sun Xinghua, his voice filled with excitement.

"I..." Sun Xinghua furrowed his brows, gazing at Luo Tian. His heart still had caution; although Luo Tian appeared very weak, the power of his sword strike against Wang Chuan was extremely strong.

"Starlight Brother, what are you still waiting for? Come on, if you don't go first, we'll challenge!" The other thousand-commanders all spoke, their voices filled with impatience.

"Then you go first!" Sun Xinghua furrowed his brows slightly, gazing at the other thousand-commanders. He was cautious by nature and confident in his caution; this very caution had saved him several times, allowing him to survive until now.

"Good! I'll go!" A thousand-commander bit his teeth and stepped forward, his body sturdy with armor. His gaze was full of provocation as he looked at Luo Tian.

"I won't make the same mistake as Wang Chuan!"

"I, Chang Teng, challenge General Luo Tian!" The thousand-commander spoke loudly, his voice resounding and filled with determination.

"Buzz..." A wave spread out; a barrier enveloped Luo Tian and Chang Teng again.

As the barrier closed, Chang Teng moved; he didn't want to be ambushed by Luo Tian like Wang Chuan, so Chang Teng immediately launched a fierce attack.

"Roar..." A green long sword emitted waves of green light, and the green sword qi formed a green dragon that swept toward Luo Tian.

"It's Green Dragon Sword Qi!" Wang Chuan's face lit up with joy because he knew this was Chang Teng's secret technique, a skill only Chang Teng could master; no one else could wield it.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's face remained pale as he swung his sword, Longyuan, emitting a cold atmosphere. It clashed with the green dragon.

"Crash..." The collision sound echoed, and Luo Tian's golden cart suddenly reversed, carrying his body to crash against the barrier. This caused Luo Tian to spit blood again.

"He's on the offensive!" People gasped, watching Chang Teng who had retreated but still maintained a strong aura.

"Big Brother's blood, where is it coming from? Why does it seem endless?" Ye Liangchen looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

"Truly a prodigy of the age!" Ye Chen had also returned to the courtyard, his gaze filled with admiration.

After returning, he inquired about Luo Chen's whereabouts but found no one named Luo Chen. Even if Ye Chen was foolish, he could guess.

He had sent a message to Luo Chen, but it was Luo Tian who arrived instead. And when Luo Tian appeared, Luo Chen disappeared. Ye Chen could imagine it with his feet.

Ye Chen's heart was not at ease; in hell, Luo Tian had treated Ye Chen as an ally, but others didn't think so. They all believed Ye Chen was Luo Tian's subordinate, servant, and slave.

Ye Chen couldn't bear this contrast; these days he had been in seclusion, his heart unsettled.

"Liangchen, I plan to return to Xinghe Prefecture. Will you come with me?" Ye Chen grabbed Ye Liangchen's arm and asked.

"Ah? Brother, why are you in such a hurry? Big Brother saved us and owes so much debt. I need to help him pay it off before leaving!" Ye Liangchen responded, looking at Ye Chen with confusion.

Eight years ago, Ye Chen had already been at odds with Luo Tian, but now that Luo Tian had saved them, Ye Chen still didn't get along with Luo Tian.

"Sigh, brother, I really have other matters!" Ye Chen saw Ye Liangchen's confusion and sighed in response.

"Then go first, brother. I'll return with Big Brother; it should take about a year!" Ye Liangchen looked at Luo Tian, who was continuously swinging his sword.

"Big Brother's acting is truly unmatched; the blood he spits out is really a big investment!" Ye Liangchen's eyes showed admiration.

"Yes, his acting is truly excellent; I didn't even notice..." Ye Chen heard Ye Liangchen's words and gritted his teeth, giving Ye Liangchen some more instructions before gazing deeply at him. He then headed toward Ko Duanshan's residence.

"Boom..." As Ye Liangchen and others spoke, the outcome at Luo Tian's side was also decided. Luo Tian appeared to be on the brink of death, and with a coincidence, he struck Chang Teng's thigh, almost dislocating it.

Blood gushed like a fountain, and Chang Teng fell pitifully to the ground, his face pale. He looked at Luo Tian, who was coughing blood more pitifully than himself.

"Oil exhausted, lamp about to go out!" At this moment, people could only describe Luo Tian with these four words; it was too pitiful.

"I feel like I could kill him with one hand..." People looked at the bloodied Luo Tian, their eyes filled with excitement.

"Chang Teng didn't pay attention to that sword strike; if he had dodged it, he would have won. And Chang Teng has already exhausted Luo Tian; the next True Immortal in the middle stage could definitely defeat Luo Tian!" Wang Chuan's mind coldly smiled; at this moment, Luo Tian was even more pitiful than him.

"Just a little bit more..." Chang Teng lay on the ground, gazing at the black greatsword in front of him. The cold atmosphere eroded Chang Teng, preventing him from moving.

"In the presence of a late True Immortal, I can do whatever I want!" Luo Tian thought to himself; another five million battle merits had been added.

"Is there anyone else?" Luo Tian panted heavily, gazing at the remaining thousand-commanders with a slight smile.

"Whoever goes next will be the Thousand-Commander!" The next moment, people's attention turned to Sun Xinghua.

"Unfortunately, I don't have battle merits!" The other thousand-commanders sighed inwardly; they wanted to go up but knew that even if they took the position of Thousand-Commander, they would eventually lose it. Moreover, their battle merits were insufficient.

"Starlight Brother, what are you still hesitating for? Among us, only you have the qualifications to be this Thousand-Commander!" Wang Chuan spoke loudly, his voice filled with urgency.

"Alright, since everyone has honored me so much, I'll take the position of Thousand-Commander!" Sun Xinghua heard the people's cheers and spoke loudly, stepping toward Luo Tian.

"A bunch of poor bastards!" Luo Tian thought angrily; even after pretending so much, no one had challenged him yet.

"Just three..." Luo Tian calculated in his mind; to fully pay off his debts, he needed at least dozens of people challenging him.

"I, Sun Xinghua, challenge General Luo Tian!" Sun Xinghua's eyes were filled with excitement. He had observed the two matches and hadn't found any issues.

At this moment, Sun Xinghua had already considered the Thousand-Commander position as his own and was thinking about how to deal with others' challenges.

"I, Sun Xinghua, challenge General Luo Tian!" Sun Xinghua spoke with vigor, stepping toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The barrier rose, enveloping Luo Tian and Sun Xinghua. Sun Xinghua's hand held a golden long sword, his gaze at Luo Tian.

"Can you still fight?" Sun Xinghua asked Luo Tian, his voice filled with arrogance.

"Of course!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, moving his hands; waves of energy spread from his hands. His aura rose and enveloped Sun Xinghua.

"His aura is strong, but it's just empty posturing..." Sun Xinghua spoke, his eyes filled with disdain. He had seen countless auras in Btian City.

But before Sun Xinghua's words finished, his face suddenly turned pale; cold sweat poured down, and his body made continuous crackling sounds. His eyes showed fear as he looked at Luo Tian sitting there.

"Domain!"

"How is that possible!" Sun Xinghua wanted to speak but found he couldn't open his mouth. His mind was filled with waves of shock and fear.

"Wrong, it's not a domain. I once saw Jiang Chen City Lord use a domain; that could change the world!" Sun Xinghua's heart was filled with terror and fear.

"Ah, no wonder the Immortal King is so terrifying. I haven't even mastered a domain yet, but it's already this strong!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration. At this moment, Sun Xinghua looked like an ant to him.

Chapter 2223: Guessing ()

Within the golden barrier, black mist obscured people's vision. The sound of collisions echoed within the barrier, causing people to show surprise.

"Earlier I clearly felt Luo Tian was weak; he looked like he could be knocked down with one palm. Why did Sun Xinghua fight so long?" A thousand-commander spoke, filled with confusion.

"Perhaps he still has a secret technique; but what use is it?" People laughed, waiting for Sun Xinghua to emerge from the barrier.

Although Sun Xinghua had been on par with them, they preferred him to become the Thousand-Commander over Luo Tian.

Within the barrier, Luo Tian continuously swung his Longyuan sword, striking the barrier. Sun Xinghua looked at Luo Tian with a strange expression, already vaguely guessing what Luo Tian was planning. His heart couldn't help but admire Luo Tian's shamelessness.

After Luo Tian had used the Heaven-Devouring Dao Method for a while, Sun Xinghua admitted defeat, knowing he was no match for Luo Tian. However, Luo Tian didn't let Sun Xinghua speak.

A strong person with the strength of a Thousand-Commander had pretended to be severely injured, allowing people to challenge him and collect battle merits. No one else could have thought of such a method—it was too disgraceful.

"You should have said so earlier..." Sun Xinghua thought angrily; he had accumulated so much battle merits, and now they were all taken.

After a full quarter of an hour, the sound of collisions finally stopped. Two figures appeared in people's sight—Luo Tian and Sun Xinghua.

"Ha! Congratulations, Brother Sun, you've become the Thousand-Commander!" People's voices of congratulations echoed as they smiled and addressed Sun Xinghua.

Sun Xinghua was completely unharmed, while Luo Tian looked pitiful like a beggar.

Hearing the congratulations, Sun Xinghua's mouth twitched; he looked at Luo Tian and then spoke to the crowd:

"I lost..."

Sun Xinghua's words had just finished, and the congratulations abruptly stopped. Everyone's faces showed disbelief as they looked at Sun Xinghua.

"Brother Sun, are you joking? How could that be!" Wang Chuan spoke loudly, as if he hadn't heard Sun Xinghua's words.

"A narrow victory, a narrow victory!" Luo Tian smiled lightly and then looked at the people, still appearing on the brink of death.

"Damn it... you were like that and three people all lost..." People thought to themselves, sensing something was off.

Wang Chuan, Chang Teng, and Sun Xinghua were all late True Immortals. Losing one might be a coincidence, but losing three was suspicious!

"Luo Tian is right; Brother Tian Fu entrusted us to him, and naturally there was a reason. I myself admitted defeat. From now on, Luo Tian is the Thousand-Commander in my heart!" Sun Xinghua spoke loudly.

"Indeed, he was persuaded..." People were speechless, watching Sun Xinghua; they hadn't expected Luo Tian to win by persuasion.

"Persuade a bastard, the True Immortal at that aura level would be suppressed! I can't fight him!" Sun Xinghua saw the satisfaction in Luo Tian's eyes and cursed inwardly.

"Alright, is there anyone else who doesn't accept it?" Luo Tian looked at the people pitifully and saw if there was anyone else to challenge.

Some people were eager but lacked battle merits, so they shook their heads. However, since Sun Xinghua had acknowledged Luo Tian as the Thousand-Commander, their voices of opposition were reduced.

"Sigh..."

"Should I lower the price a bit..." Luo Tian thought to himself but eventually gave up on the idea. After all, these people were his own men; it was hard to earn battle merits.

"Alright, everyone go rest. I don't have any demands; just don't break the military regulations. If anyone troubles you, fight back. I'll take responsibility for any incidents!" Luo Tian addressed the people and headed toward his room.

"Is it over?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, people were surprised; they had expected Luo Tian to be very arrogant or furious. Instead, he only said these two sentences and was done.

"What are you looking at? Do you want me to beat you up?" As people were surprised, a stern voice echoed from Luo Tian's room, causing everyone to tremble.

"Go on, go!" Sun Xinghua laughed lightly and led the way out of Luo Tian's courtyard.

Three thousand people, orderly, left the courtyard. As they exited, everyone looked at Sun Xinghua.

"Brother Sun Xinghua, what's going on? You had the Thousand-Commander position but didn't take it?" Wang Chuan and others asked with confusion.

"This matter is over; I advise you all to avoid provoking the Thousand-Commander. Whoever provokes him will be in trouble!" Sun Xinghua looked at Wang Chuan and others deeply, then flew away toward his residence.

"There must be something wrong; maybe he's hiding his strength!" People, who were all battle-tested veterans, naturally understood the subtlety in Sun Xinghua's words—that Luo Tian was not to be provoked.

"For now, let's just watch..." People sighed longingly and then dispersed.

Luo Tian's situation didn't receive people's attention; everyone was focused on the battle scenes in Tian Fu's courtyard.

Every day, collisions continued as strong people fought one after another. Time passed, and seven days had finally gone by.

"Come on! Who wants to fight me?" Xue Zilong's face was filled with madness, his gaze cold as he looked at the onlookers.

Wherever his eyes fell, people showed fear. These seven days had completely washed away the previous incident where Luo Tian almost stepped on him; he had killed nine late True Immortals and defeated four peak True Immortals, leaving no one to dare provoke him.

"Congratulations, General Xue Zilong, you've become the Thousand-Commander!" Respectful congratulations echoed as people looked at Xue Zilong with reverence.

"I am willing to follow General Xue Zilong..."

"I also do..." Some people spoke directly, expressing their loyalty to Xue Zilong. After all, Xue Zilong had just become the Thousand-Commander and lacked people; this was a gift of snow in times of need.

"Good, first help me repair this courtyard!" Xue Zilong's eyes showed a smile, enjoying people's praises. His gaze turned toward Luo Tian's courtyard.

"This should have been mine long ago!" Xue Zilong muttered quietly, turning into the courtyard.

The curtain rose again; Xue Zilong's name appeared once more, causing people to gasp.

"Eventually, he has strength; with the strength of a Thousand-Commander, he will surely rise!" People discussed Xue Zilong. Soon, his name became the topic of conversation among people.

However, as people discussed, Luo Tian's name was also mentioned; he was the one who had almost stepped on Xue Zilong.

"Right, there's also Luo Tian; he has crippled legs and is said to have suffered irreversible injuries!" Those who had been defeated by Xue Zilong turned their gaze toward Luo Tian, recalling the incident.

"Spread the news!" Luo Tian sat in his courtyard and addressed Sun Xinghua.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian was observing the cauldron before him; these days he had been refining Ghost-Repelling Pills, achieving considerable success. According to his calculation, within a month and with some more battle merits sent, he should be able to pay off his debts.

"Yes..." Sun Xinghua stood there with a respectful expression, then left.

As Sun Xinghua departed, messages spread throughout Btian City.

"Thousand-Commander Wang Chuan challenged Luo Tian, was ambushed due to carelessness and lost. Thousand-Commander Chang Teng challenged Luo Tian, almost defeated him, but Luo Tian barely won. He also persuaded Sun Xinghua with his eloquence."

"Almost defeated by Chang Teng, winning was sheer luck!" People immediately seized on this point.

"Currently, with Brother Tian Fu's position of Thousand-Commander secured, and the Second Blood Face's Thousand-Commander position previously very stable, now it isn't!"

"Blood Face has left; no one supports him. How can he keep his position as Thousand-Commander?" People kept discussing, and some even started heading toward Luo Tian's residence.

Among these people were two True Immortals at the peak, and many more late True Immortals. These people had one common feature: their strength was stronger than Wang Chuan and Chang Teng.

"General, over ten people have arrived!" Sun Xinghua stood respectfully in Luo Tian's courtyard and addressed him.

"Ah, I wonder how many will be deceived!" Luo Tian thought to himself and stepped out of the courtyard.

"Another performance... it's really tiring..." As Luo Tian exited the courtyard, laughter echoed in his ears.

"I, Wang Jiuchang, challenge General Luo Tian!" A cheerful voice echoed; the familiar barrier enveloped Luo Tian and Wang Jiuchang.

"Clatter..." The golden wheels rotated; before the barrier rose, Luo Tian directly swung his sword.

As Wang Jiuchang began to challenge, others also launched their attacks; of course, many were watching.

A battle... two battles... Luo Tian appeared like an indestructible superman, each time looking as if he were dying but ultimately winning unexpectedly.

Time passed day by day; the number of people challenging Luo Tian increased, surprising everyone. Yet, each time he fought, it was a bloody battle, but he mysteriously won every time.

The more this happened, the more it ignited people's greed within their hearts, as if they had fallen into a frenzy.

"This is the thirty-first one, thirty-one consecutive victories without a loss!" As time passed, people finally realized something was wrong with Luo Tian.

"Go... he must have a problem; three battles were still luck, but thirty-one? Who can do that?"

"There's only one possibility—he's faking it!"

"It's battle merits; each challenge gives five million battle merits!" Eventually, some people realized Luo Tian's intention and shouted in surprise.

Chapter 2224: Forced Take ()

"He wants to collect battle merits!" A late True Immortal thousand-commander spoke, his gaze at Luo Tian sitting there. As this thousand-commander spoke, people immediately realized the truth.

"Thirty-one battles, fifteen billion five hundred million battle merits, plus our three, totaling seventeen billion!" Wang Chuan spoke, his voice filled with shock.

At first, people hadn't focused on battle merits; after calculating this, they felt Luo Tian had accumulated too many.

"Too shameless! So what's his strength? He faked losing thirty-one times, each time looking like he was dying..." People looked at Luo Tian sitting there with disbelief.

"Who else wants to challenge me?" Luo Tian glared fiercely at the thousand-commander who had spoken, instantly scaring him half to death. He knew he had ruined Luo Tian's plan.

"Damn it, my battle merits! That was my ten years of savings; it's all gone!" Many thousand-commanders showed anger, clearly not happy with Luo Tian's methods.

"Victory belongs to the strong; if you weren't greedy for the position of Thousand-Commander, why would you lose your battle merits!" Lei Yong spoke with disdain, his eyes glowing with light as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"I really was injured; don't doubt me!" Luo Tian looked at everyone and coughed twice more, pretending to spit blood.

"Your blood isn't free! You've spat it out thirty-one times and still haven't finished!" People cursed inwardly but dared not speak aloud, for if Luo Tian hadn't truly been injured, his strength could easily kill them all.

"Come challenge me quickly! I'm really weak now; one finger could crush me!" Luo Tian kept speaking, but no one challenged him anymore.

"Sigh..." Luo Tian sighed deeply and knew people wouldn't challenge again. He looked at them disdainfully and walked into the house.

"Is there no one left to manage this? It's too evil! He played us like that!" People shouted, their voices filled with anger.

"Damn bastard, he's faking his injuries!" Xue Zilong's face was dark; he had been watching Luo Tian's battles and still held a grudge for the previous incident. However, he lacked both strength and confidence to fight Luo Tian.
