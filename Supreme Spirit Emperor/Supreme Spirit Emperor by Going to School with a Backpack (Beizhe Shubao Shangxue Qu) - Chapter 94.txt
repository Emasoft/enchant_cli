“Crash……” The emerald-green blade, under the trembling gazes of onlookers, struck Huang Tianrui with astonishing force.

At the very moment the Imperial Sword touched Huang Tianrui’s body, it shattered with a thunderous crack, seeping into his pores and penetrating his flesh.

Huang Tianrui’s spirit trembled violently, his face contorting in pain as if something within him was being pulled. His body convulsed uncontrollably.

The onlookers watched in horror as Huang Tianrui, a master at the Bone-Transforming Stage, writhed in agony. The sheer intensity of his suffering was beyond ordinary comprehension.

“Crack……” After several breaths, a resounding sound echoed from within Huang Tianrui’s body as something shattered.

Amidst the crowd’s astonished gazes, a crimson crescent moon mark on Huang Tianrui’s forehead exploded into fragments, vanishing from his brow.

“Success!” Huang Tiannu and others exclaimed with joy.

On the other side, Leng Qiuchan also conjured an Imperial Sword of Green Wood. Seeing Luotian’s success, she wasted no time and slashed it into Huang Bo dang. The crescent moon mark on his forehead also shattered with a thunderous crack.

“Haha…… Heaven does not forsake the Huang clan!” Huang Tiannu’s face glistened with tears as he gazed at Luotian with reverence.

Hans Tianya and Zhao Hongze, however, wore expressions of embarrassment mixed with hope as they looked toward Luotian, yearning to beg but hesitating due to their previous enmity.

“Seems I must hasten,” Yang Huanyu frowned, glancing at Huang Tianrui and his son who had escaped his control, then at the array radiating blood qi. His movements quickened, leaving trails of shadows in his wake.

“Crash…… Crash……” As Yang Huanyu spoke, explosions erupted from the three families. Crimson blood was drawn into the array.

Luotian let out a cold snort, his five fingers splayed open. The wood-elemental energy from the heavens and his own body converged violently in the sky.

“Hum……” A cascade of one-foot-long wood-elemental imperial swords, radiating imperial might, filled the sky.

Luotian lowered his hand slightly, and the swords rained down upon Huang’s disciples like a storm.

Chapter 460: Blood Emperor's Return

Like rain, the imperial swords struck Huang’s disciples, causing their bodies to emit resounding sounds. Their crescent moon marks shattered in unison, halting their deaths.

Yet the other two families fared far worse. Their disciples had already suffered heavy casualties, and this devastating attack reduced their numbers to less than ten percent—especially since many bore no crescent moon marks.

Seeing this, Hans Tianya and Zhao Hongze’s faces twisted with anguish as they cried out to Luotian, “Luotian! Please save our families!”

Hearing their plea, Luotian’s brow furrowed. He turned to Huang Tiannu.

“Hmph! You’ve the audacity to demand help after trying to annihilate us? How bold!” Huang Tiannu sneered at them.

“Old Huang, we’ve coexisted in Beiming City for years. Though we were rivals, please consider our shared plight and speak on our behalf. We swear henceforth Huang Clan shall reign over Beiming City!” They pleaded desperately, their faces contorted with despair.

“Swear a blood oath to submit to Huang Clan, and I shall save you. Otherwise, today Han and Zhao clans shall be eradicated!” Luotian’s voice was cold as ice.

Hearing this, the two men hesitated. If Luotian’s words were true, their families would forever be subjugated under Huang Clan—something they found hard to accept.

Yet, refusal meant their clans would indeed be wiped out. Their disciples also bore the same anguish; for years, three families had ruled Beiming City in equal power. Now they were to submit—hard for them to accept.

Though the situation was unbearable, not all hesitated over life and death.

“Heaven bears witness! I Han Wentao swear allegiance to Huang Clan henceforth. If I break this oath, may heaven strike me down and deny me rebirth!” A youth’s voice rang out.

Trembling, he released a drop of his blood, which formed strange symbols on his chest.

Seeing his comrades fall one by one before him, Han Wentao finally yielded and swore the blood oath.

Hearing this, Luotian’s lips curled slightly. He pointed his finger, and a one-foot-long green wood imperial sword soared through the air, slicing into the disciple’s body.

“Crack……” Han Wentao’s crescent moon mark shattered.

Regaining control of his body, Han Wentao wiped sweat from his brow, his face alight with gratitude as he stepped into Huang Clan’s ranks.

With one man setting the precedent, others gradually changed their minds. In the face of death, trivial matters were meaningless—especially pledging allegiance to another clan.

“Han Wentong swears… Zhao Meng swears…” The sound of oaths echoed through the two families.

Each oath was met with a sword slicing into the sworn disciple’s body.

Hans Tianya and Zhao Hongze wore expressions of inner conflict before, aged decades in an instant, ordered their people: “All swear!”

With the elders’ command, the disciples’ faces lit up. They spoke their oaths, and droplets of blood floated into the sky before merging into their chests.

“Why didn’t you do this earlier?!” Luotian snorted, summoning hundreds more green wood imperial swords into the sky. They descended upon the two families’ disciples.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luotian released Huang Tiannu’s seal, turning to Hans Tianya and Zhao Hongze with a mocking gaze.

“Haha… we old men don’t need to, do we?” Hans Tianya chuckled bitterly.

“What do you think?” Luotian’s gaze darkened, his eyes piercing.

Under Luotian’s stare, the two men relented, their gazes filled with reluctant resentment as they swore.

Green wood imperial swords materialized and struck them, restoring their mobility. They then glared coldly at Yang Huanyu in the sky.

“You’ve some ability, but it’s too late now. You’ll all die—just a matter of when!” Yang Huanyu ignored their icy stares, smiling at Luotian.

“Hmph! You’re alone now. We have five Soul-Refining Stage masters—what right do you have to speak so boldly?” Huang Tiannu roared, charging at Yang Huanyu.

“Who said I’m alone?” Yang Huanyu’s lips curled slightly as three drops of blood flew from his fingers, merging into the array.

“Hum……” The crimson array trembled upon contact with Yang Huanyu’s blood, emitting a resonant hum. A soul-shaking aura spread through the crowd.

“Blood Emperor, now is the time!” Yang Huanyu’s face paled from losing three drops of blood, yet his eyes burned with intensity.

“Crack……” As Yang Huanyu’s words echoed, the ground cracked violently. Cracks spread across the earth.

Huang Tiannu and his companions halted mid-charge, their gazes filled with terror as they stared at the fissures.

“What is this? A seal beneath the array? What lies sealed within?” Luotian and Zheng Xin’s faces paled as they felt an overwhelming aura that paralyzed them.

“Roar!” A deafening cry erupted from the cracks, followed by a volcanic eruption of blood qi.

“Swoosh…… Swoosh……” The sound of breaking air echoed as waves of energy approached from all directions.

“Who opened the Blood Emperor’s seal?!” A loud voice echoed, and four figures appeared in the sky. The leader was an elderly man with white hair.

“Ding Hongfei?” Luotian’s forehead broke out in cold sweat. He recognized the middle-aged man behind the elder—Ding Hongfei, who had parted ways with him in Beiming City.

Hearing the elder’s words, Luotian knew trouble had arrived. “Blood Emperor” was no ordinary foe. He recalled that Chou Pingtai, the “Devouring Heaven Demon Emperor,” had reached Soul-Refining Peak. If something bore the title “Emperor,” its power was at least Soul-Refining Late Stage.

Chapter 461: Five Elements Seal

“City Governor?” Yang Huanyu sneered, stepping into the crimson array.

“You opened the seal?!” The elder’s face reddened with fury, shouting at him.

Seeing the four figures in the sky, Huang Tiannu’s group cheered, calling out: “City Governor!”

The elder turned to Huang Tiannu and his companions.

“You’re truly desperate! Fighting here while the city is at peace! It’s clear you three clans have been too comfortable!” The elder spoke, his body glowing with brown energy.

“Where is Dong Zhiyu? Why hasn’t he arrived yet? If he doesn’t, it’ll be a disaster!” A Soul-Refining Peak elder behind the elder barked, his gaze scanning the distance.

“This…” Ding Hongfei’s face twisted with hesitation but urgency forced him to reveal Dong Zhiyu’s fate.

“Damn it!” Upon hearing Ding Hongfei’s account, the three elders cursed.

“Crash……” A sound of earth breaking echoed as a blood-red hand, capable of crushing stars, emerged from the ground.

“Haha…… I’ve finally escaped! This seal has trapped me for so long. Today, I shall drench this Eastern Domain in blood!” A maniacal laugh echoed through the crowd.

“Preceptor, first we must repair the seal!” Ding Hongfei’s face was anxious. The moment the blood hand appeared, he felt its aura affecting him.

“Repair it? How? Without Dong Zhiyu, who will perform the Golden Seal?” The elder’s voice trembled as he realized if the Blood Emperor broke free, none would escape.

Hearing this, Ding Hongfei’s face twisted with inner conflict. He whispered into the elder’s mind through his spiritual sense.

Upon hearing Ding Hongfei’s transmission, the elder furrowed his brow and turned to Luotian.

“Boy, this is tied to you too. You come!” The elder’s voice rang out as he cast a golden token toward Luotian.

Luotian resisted the pressure of the aura and caught the golden token in his hand.

At that moment, Luotian’s spirit trembled; he felt no longer constrained by the aura. His body regained mobility.

Examining the token, it was a golden seal radiating brilliance, allowing him to move freely.

“Hum……” A powerful imprint then entered Luotian’s mind.

“Boy, hurry up! There’s no time for you to ponder!” The elder’s voice echoed as Luotian puzzled.

At that moment, another blood-red hand burst from the ground, its overwhelming aura forcing everyone to bow slightly.

“Five Elements Seal!” Luotian sighed inwardly, his elemental wings unfurling as he joined Ding Hongfei and the three elders.

“Seven-Element Body Type?” The other two elders gaped, their eyes fixed on Luotian.

Their shock was fleeting. The elder waved his hand, signaling the five of them to disperse and take their positions.

In such a short time, Luotian understood the Five Elements Seal’s power but doubted his ability to wield it. He sighed, “I’ll try my best.”

“Relying on last-minute tricks? I’d like to see how much of the seal’s power you can unleash!” Yang Huanyu sneered, slapping the ground. The cracks spread faster.

“Five Elements Seal! Seal the elements!” The elder roared, casting a brown token into the air.

At the same time, the other four elders cast their tokens. Five colors formed five long arcs, surrounding the crimson array on the ground.

“Crash……” The five tokens plunged into the earth, rapidly growing to several zhang in height.

“Five Elements Seal! Hah! Another Five Elements Seal—what of it? Today I shall break free and drench the Eastern Domain in blood!” The earth rumbled as a cold voice echoed, its aura striking everyone’s minds.

“Earth Seal! Converge!” The elder chanted, his hands moving rapidly to channel energy into the brown token.

Ding Hongfei also wore a solemn expression, his gaze filled with concern as he glanced at Luotian. He noticed Luotian was also forming seals, his face showing surprise.

Luotian, however, had no time to care about others. His hands moved swiftly, forming shadows in the air. His forehead was drenched in sweat—this was his first time using it, and he was giving it his all.

“Gold Seal! Converge!” Luotian roared, a sharp golden energy radiating from his hands. He felt a surge of joy.

At the same time, the others completed their seals, their faces showing astonishment at Luotian’s skill.

“Though your speed and power aren’t as refined as ours, this is your first time. Achieving this level is already remarkable!” One elder smiled in satisfaction at Luotian.

“Hum……” As the five seals took effect, the tokens glowed fiercely, rising into the sky and merging with the heavens. They formed a canopy of symbols over the crimson array, also covering the two blood-red hands that had emerged.

“Sizzle……” The symbols met the blood hands, emitting a sizzling sound that made them tremble.

“Damn it! You dare try to seal me? You’re dreaming! A Soul-Refining Peak and Late Stage array—what are you to me? Blood Sea Drenching!” The earth roared with fury.

The voice echoed, and the two blood hands grabbed fiercely. The sky darkened, winds howled, and a bloody scent filled the battlefield.

“Ascend!” A cold voice echoed like winter winds, chilling everyone’s hearts.

“Swoosh…… Swoosh……” Blood rain fell from the dark clouds, drenching everyone and the crimson array. The array’s blood qi deepened further.

Chapter 462: Is This Beiming City?

The overwhelming blood rain dyed the world red, filling the crimson array. Yang Huanyu bathed in it, his face serene with delight—this scene was chilling.

“Years have passed. You city governors are truly declining! Now you’re only Soul-Refining Peak, no one even reaching the Ritual Soul Stage. You lack the qualifications to seal me!” The cold voice echoed through the blood rain.

The Five Elements Seal’s symbols, previously cast by Luotian and others, dimmed in the blood rain. Some even turned red.

“Damn it! The seal is breaking!” The elder’s face showed urgency but despair.

“Back then, I was wounded, giving you an opening. Now that my injuries are healed, you—Soul-Refining Peak and Late Stage masters—are nothing but pests!” The voice echoed.

After the words, the Five Elements Seal’s symbols turned red entirely. The array’s blood qi deepened to a dark crimson.

“Time is up. I, the Blood Emperor, am coming out! Haha!” The voice echoed as blood qi surged.

A red aura rose from the array, splitting the ground open. A blood-red figure shot into the sky like a meteor.

The red blood formed a spectral body, standing in the air with madness in his eyes as he gazed at Luotian and the city governors like ants.

“Dare you ascend before me?” The blood figure scoffed, his blood-formed hand pressing down.

“Crash…… Crash……” Luotian and the five elders were crushed into the ground like cannonballs, spitting blood.

“Done…” Everyone’s hearts sank in despair as they stared at the red figure.

“Who used a formation to free me? I must thank them!” The blood figure’s head glowed with two beams of light, scanning the crowd. His gaze landed on Yang Huanyu.

“Is it you?” The blood figure asked, addressing Yang Huanyu.

“Little Blood, do you remember me?” Yang Huanyu opened his eyes, smiling as he gazed at the blood figure.

“Hum……” After Yang Huanyu’s words, the world fell silent. People could hear their own breath and heartbeats.

The blood figure, upon seeing Yang Huanyu’s eyes, trembled violently before transforming into a red arrow and rushing to his front.

“Hail the Master!” The blood figure knelt before Yang Huanyu.

Seeing this, everyone was stunned. Though they couldn’t move, their eyes showed disbelief.

“Who is Yang Huanyu?” Luotian’s mind was filled with questions.

This man was the legendary Blood Emperor of ancient times, yet he called Yang Huanyu “Master.” Could Yang Huanyu be a powerful being who had taken over another’s body?

Luotian was stunned beyond measure, but he dismissed the thought. A reincarnated soul would carry an ancient aura, yet Yang Huanyu showed no such signs—just a youth of his age.

“Little Blood, it’s been a while. I was right to seal you!” Yang Huanyu smiled.

“Why haven’t they come out? Why did you free me, Master?” The blood figure asked with confusion.

“Naturally, there’s a reason. The Book of Epochs has appeared, and it’s in this boy’s hands. Plus, your original body is gone after being sealed for so long. I found you a new one—seven-element body type!” Yang Huanyu chuckled, glancing at Luotian.

“I told you, today you must die!” Yang Huanyu smiled, his voice tinged with excitement.

Luotian stared at Yang Huanyu fiercely but felt anxious.

“He’s too strong! This blood figure isn’t one I can handle. If he were Soul-Refining Peak, I could manage it. But this figure is clearly beyond that—Ritual Soul Stage or higher!” Luotian sighed inwardly.

“Haha, seven-element body type! Though I’m a soul now, I am complete. My strength reaches Ritual Soul Mid-Stage. Once I take over this boy’s body and fully merge, I should recover to Soul-Refining Early Stage!” The blood figure laughed cruelly, his body forming a massive mouth that sucked in.

“Little Blood, remember to fetch the Book of Epochs for me first!” Yang Huanyu reminded.

“Sure, Master! I’ll handle it!” The blood mouth swiftly absorbed Luotian.

“Done…” Luotian sighed inwardly, even able to smell the repulsive blood scent.

“Boy, remember next life not to oppose my master. Blame it on you obtaining what you shouldn’t—The Book of Epochs belongs only to my master!” The Blood Emperor’s mocking voice echoed from the mouth.

After speaking, the blood figure transformed into a massive mouth and sucked again, its powerful suction pulling Luotian.

“Brother!”
“Luotian…”
“Grandmaster… Master…” Countless cries echoed, but they could do nothing. The Blood Emperor’s overwhelming aura left them immobile.

Just as Luotian was about to enter the blood mouth, the sky suddenly changed. A dark void rift appeared, winds howling through it and even scattering the blood clouds above.

“Roar……” A long tiger roar echoed, causing some body-refining stage people to bleed from their mouths.

Long Baobao’s face lit up at the tiger roar: “Third Uncle!”

Hearing the roar, the Blood Emperor paused his absorption of Luotian and transformed back into a red figure. He gazed at the void rift.

Under everyone’s trembling gazes, a black monkey emerged from the rift, its large eyes like lanterns filled with confusion as it fell.

“Crash…” The monkey sat on the ground, confusedly scratching its head.

“Fourth Uncle, you’re here too! Come save me! I can’t move!” A childish voice echoed. The black monkey’s body trembled, its large eyes showing joy.

“Long Baobao! How did you come out? Haha!” The monkey stood up, rushing toward Long Baobao.

This movement caused the ground to tremble as deep footprints were left in its wake.

“Old Fourth, be careful! Don’t step on people!” A domineering voice echoed as a black tiger appeared.

A young man with a smile sat on the tiger’s back, while an old man with white hair behind him constantly frowned.

Luotian’s lips twitched as he watched the black monkey and tiger, but relief washed over him. He took a deep breath, sighing inwardly that these two deities had arrived just in time. Without them, he would’ve died here today.

With their arrival, the Blood Emperor’s aura vanished instantly. The crowd could move again but dared not act rashly, fearing the monkey might accidentally crush them.

“You dare step on me… you’ll die…”
“Pfft…” The Blood Emperor’s cold words echoed, but he only spoke half before the black tiger leaped down. It crushed the Blood Emperor, who had just begun to recover into human form, splattering blood everywhere.

The crowd sighed at the tiger’s power while their faces showed deep sympathy. This was a being who had paralyzed them all moments ago, now crushed by a single step.

That wasn’t enough—another step finished it off, leaving the crowd stunned.

“Luotian pays homage to Tiger Master! Honors to Monkey Master!” Luotian bowed respectfully.

“Luotian, you’re alive! I knew your luck was tough—too hard to die!” The tiger’s face showed a human-like smile, his voice echoing far.

Hearing this, others gaped. These two titans knew Luotian.

“My god! Am I dreaming? Our old leader knows such fierce beings… no, fierce beasts…” Wu Di’s group was stunned.

Normally, seeing a Soul-Refining Stage master in Beiming City was a great event. Now, after nearly killing Luotian, the Blood Emperor appeared, followed by two beasts that crushed it with a single step.

Ding Yuanshan and other city governors also gazed at the two titanic beasts with reverence. Such power was unprecedented for them.

Hans Tianya and Zhao Hongze no longer had their former arrogance as Beiming City’s masters. Though they ruled there, they hadn’t truly faced the strength of sects. Now, they were nothing—what right did they have to be arrogant? They felt even joining Huang Clan wasn’t so bad, given Luotian and Huang Clan’s status.

Everyone gazed at the two beasts but failed to notice Yang Huanyu, who stood nearby with a cold expression. His feet sent ripples, and he slowly vanished from the spot.

Even the tiger and monkey didn’t notice. Only the elder in the sky furrowed his brow, gazing at Yang Huanyu’s vanished form before returning to normal.

“Luotian pays homage to the elder!” Luotian and Leng Qiuchuan recognized the elder as a pillar of Yuling Sect.

“Good,” the elder nodded, gazing at Luotian before noticing Leng Qiuchuan’s worried expression. He gave a slight nod.

“Enough, you two—rest now,” the elder said, gazing at a buried storage bag in the earth. He swallowed saliva.

“You’ve gone too far! Dare to treat me as a soft target?” The blood figure’s aura surged again, painting the sky red.

“Blood Emperor? If you were at your peak, we might have been outmatched. Now, you’re just a soul without a body—dare to challenge us?” The tiger sneered, his voice like thunder.

As the tiger’s words ended, an invisible wave struck the Blood Emperor.

“Crash……” The Blood Emperor, still boasting, turned into a shower of blood before the crowd.

“Suck…” The tiger didn’t stop, opening his maw to reveal white fangs glowing with cold light.

Under the tiger’s suction, the Blood Emperor’s shattered body was drawn to his mouth.

“Converge…” The tiger roared, and the blood qi condensed into a half-foot-long red pearl floating above his maw.

“What are you doing?” A terrified voice echoed from the blood ball. The Blood Emperor had no more arrogance now.

“Just my nephew has no toys! Give me another!” The tiger roared again, his tiger roar echoing.

As the tiger’s words ended, the blood ball shrank further into a deep red.

“Fourth Uncle, help!” The tiger exhaled, blowing the blood ball toward the black monkey.

At this moment, Long Baobao sat on the black monkey’s shoulder, his small body almost invisible unless closely observed.

The black monkey took the blood ball and began kneading it, accompanied by the Blood Emperor’s agonized cries.

“Little Master!” As Luotian stared at the Blood Emperor being kneaded by the black monkey, a familiar voice made him tremble. His eyes shot toward the tiger’s back.

Three-colored elemental wings unfolded on the tiger’s back, and Zhang Ziping appeared before Luotian. His face showed excitement.

“Big Master!” Luotian’s voice trembled as he gazed at this familiar figure. Warmth surged in his heart.

Chapter 463: The White-Cloaked Woman

Seeing Zhang Ziping, Luotian was overjoyed. In a way, Zhang Ziping was like his master—more familiar than the one-time encounter with his original teacher.

Zhang Ziping was equally thrilled to see Luotian alive, having thought he had died. He hadn’t realized it until his disorientation from the void traversal made him arrive late.

Luotian, meanwhile, had been completely wrapped in the tiger’s fur, making Zhang Ziping invisible unless closely observed.

The two brothers embraced fiercely. Luotian briefly explained how he had arrived in Beiming City and entered Kunlun Mountain.

“Yang Huanyu!” As they spoke, Luotian suddenly remembered Yang Huanyu. His spiritual sense swept the battlefield but found no trace of him, his face falling in disappointment.

“He escaped again!” Luotian murmured softly.

Yang Huanyu had become even more mysterious in Luotian’s mind—his power rivaling his own, mastery of various formations, even the ability to break the Five Elements Seal. The Blood Emperor called him “Master,” shrouding Yang Huanyu in a deep mystery.

“Don’t overthink it. Once you’ve reached Soul-Refining Stage, your teacher will meet you,” Zhang Ziping comforted him.

“Teacher!” Hearing this, Luotian’s body trembled. He remembered his one-time teacher, Zhang Daotian, who had promised him a gift upon reaching Soul-Refining Stage.

“Haha…” A giggling sound echoed as Long Baobao sat on the black monkey’s broad shoulder, holding a red ball the size of his head. He kicked it repeatedly on the monkey’s back.

Luotian stared at the deep red ball flying around like a ball, his lips twitching.

The Blood Emperor, once a mighty figure, now was a ball under someone’s feet. If the Blood Emperor were alive, he’d surely spit blood at this sight.

“Boy, come with us. My elder said to take you back to Dahan Forest for a while,” the tiger transformed into a dark-skinned strongman, approaching Luotian.

Luotian furrowed his brow. He knew Long Jian and his wife might have good intentions, but he had heard from Zhang Ziping that the soul lamp of Wuxing Sect had gone out, and the entire sect believed him dead. Perhaps Long Jian and his wife also thought he was dead.

But now, he hadn’t finished his business in the Eastern Domain, and Shanyan’s body wasn’t fully refined. Plus, Yuling Sect needed to inform Cold Hongcai, and Beiming City required his temporary management. Going with the tiger to Dahan Forest now was not the right time.

“Master… I still have some matters in the Eastern Domain. Let you two take Long Baobao back first. Once I finish my business there, I’ll return to the Northern Domain to visit Master Long!” Luotian bowed respectfully.
