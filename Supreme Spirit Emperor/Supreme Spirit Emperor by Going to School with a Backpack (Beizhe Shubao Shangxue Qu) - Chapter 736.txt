"Can this complete Ten-Grade Immortal Pill allow him to break through?" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke softly, causing everyone's eyes to brighten.

"What?" Hearing Jiang Yuanxiong's words, Luo Tian turned toward him. At that time, he and Jiang Yuanxiong had jointly refined the Return-to-Life Pills, saving Black and White Death and enabling them to break through to the threshold of Immortal Emperor.

"Indeed, Master Jiang must have succeeded in his research!" Long Jie, Yao Chen, and Chen Zhanbiao looked toward Jiang Yuanxiong. Their bloodlines were astonishing; over the years, Jiang Yuanxiong's elixirs often had them test them. Thus, they were most aware of the results. Their rapid breakthroughs to the peak of Immortal King were due to testing Jiang Yuanxiong's elixirs. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for them to advance so swiftly.

"Approximately complete. I lack certainty. Zhang Daotian, would you like to join me in researching it?" Jiang Yuanxiong gazed at Zhang Daotian, his eyes filled with anticipation.

"Your alchemy surpasses mine now!" Zhang Daotian sighed, and the two exchanged a smile.

"Luo Tian, Medicine King, you both come as well. With our four combined strengths, we should be able to complete the Ten-Grade Immortal Pill!" Jiang Yuanxiong turned his gaze toward Luo Tian and the Medicine King.

"More than willing! Master Jiang's alchemical mastery is unparalleled in my lifetime. I believe it has reached the level of our Medicine King Sect's ancestors!" The Medicine King, upon hearing this, displayed excitement in his eyes.

"Good. Prepare yourselves. We four must enter seclusion!" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke, the time pressing. The four immediately headed for Medicine King Mountain, as it was undeniably the place with the finest and most abundant herbs.

No one stopped them as they left. Black and White Death, along with Da Niu and Er Niu, also began secluding themselves to recover their injuries. They hoped to restore themselves before the final battle, for even a threshold Immortal Emperor's strength could tip the scales.

...

The black hell seemed to darken the sky with the capture of Rebirth Gate. In a dark hall, Yang Huanyu sat there, his aura surging with an overwhelming pressure. Below Yang Huanyu's seat stood a row of cloaked figures, their faces marked with reverence.

Yang Huanyu held a black chess piece in his hand, rotating it between his fingers. The people standing there trembled, unsure of what Yang Huanyu was thinking.

"Indeed, you have not disappointed me. But this is where it ends..." Yang Huanyu spoke softly, a sinister smile on his lips.

"Disperse! All under hell's command must gather. Prepare for an attack on the Immortal Realm in half a month!" Yang Huanyu addressed those standing before him.

"Yes!" They bowed respectfully, but their eyes burned with fanaticism.

Yang Huanyu stepped out of the hall and ascended a dark staircase, emerging onto a gray long bridge.

Rippling...

The Yellow River waters surged, and a vast passage appeared before Yang Huanyu. His eyes deepened.

"Reincarnation, I have come..." Yang Huanyu spoke softly, leaping into the air and stepping upon the Yellow River. He strode toward its depths.

...

Time flowed slowly, seven days passed. Hell's people began to frenzy towards the Eight Ghost Gates. Regardless of their size, countless forces gathered, each gate hosting billions and still growing.

"What's going on? Has Yang Huanyu gone mad, sending all of hell into motion?" Everyone was stunned.

"He's always been mad. It seems he intends to involve the entire world in this battle!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, recalling the previous blood sacrifice on Tianyuan Continent.

Exactly like that time. However, back then Yang Huanyu relied on a formation, but now he was attacking directly with people.

"Every force in the Immortal Realm must prepare. This is a battle of annihilation; everyone must participate!" Jiang Nanxuan announced, issuing command after command.

The Immortal Realm was in uproar. Previous battles had little to do with minor forces; whoever controlled the Central Three Heavens merely needed to submit. But this time was different. With all hell's forces involved, if they surged forward, it would inevitably affect them.

The Immortal Realm naturally wouldn't sit idle. The Nine Immortal Mountains, the people of the Central Three Heavens, even those from the Lower Three Heavens were summoned to the Central Three Heavens, beginning their assembly at the Eight Ghost Gates.

...

On Medicine King Mountain, these days it had become desolate. All of Medicine King Mountain's disciples were evacuated because of Luo Tian and the others' arrival. On their second day, a deafening explosion shattered two peaks of Medicine King Mountain. Fortunately, Luo Tian intervened in time to prevent casualties.

After that, the people of Medicine King Mountain received orders to evacuate and garrison at the Eight Ghost Gates to avoid casualties.

Boom...

A radiant light column pierced the sky, shattering the storm clouds above. A formidable pressure spread across nine heavens and ten earths, as if an omnipotent strength had arrived.

Under the Shennong Cauldron, Luo Tian and the others looked with excitement at the golden light rising.

"Consumed! This is Medicine King Mountain's last batch of immortal herbs. If we don't succeed now, it will be impossible. But if successful, even sacrificing my life is worth it!" The Medicine King roared, his body resembling a skeleton.

These days, the four had been exhausted. Their spirits and energy were drained. The most exhausted was the Medicine King, not only due to all of Medicine King Mountain's herbs but also because he had sacrificed the entire mountain's divine fire for Xiaoqi to consume. This was unbearable.

Chapter 2804: Blood Sea in All Directions

"An unprecedented item has emerged!" As the column of light shot into the sky, everyone in the Immortal Realm felt it.

"Luo Tian, now is the time to take the pill!" The Medicine King, Jiang Yuanxiong, and Zhang Daotian roared, their eyes fixed on Luo Tian standing up.

"Good!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and the world treasure Shennong Cauldron emitted a hum. The lid lifted, releasing an even stronger pressure that pushed Luo Tian back.

"This pill, open the heavens!" Jiang Yuanxiong laughed, spitting blood under the pressure and gazing at the golden immortal pill rising.

"Give it to me!" Luo Tian roared, leaping into the air and reaching for the golden immortal pill. Boom...

However, Luo Tian's mighty hand shattered under this fluctuation, and the wild energy sent Jiang Yuanxiong and the others flying back.

"I won't let you escape, no matter what!" Luo Tian spoke coldly. At this moment, he could not allow the pill to leave.

Roar...

A roar echoed from the heavens. A golden-black vortex appeared above everyone's heads, and black claws descended toward the pill.

Buzz...

The golden immortal pill emitted a continuous hum. It actively collided with the hellish claws.

Another deafening explosion shook Medicine King Mountain, causing its terrain to crack extensively.

The hellish claws shattered. Luo Tian's brow furrowed slightly, his forehead's flame mark flickering. The Flame of Heaven and Earth, with sixteen colors, imprisoned the entire sky in a fiery cage, trapping the pill within. Simultaneously, Luo Tian's domain expanded, preventing the pill from escaping.

"Perhaps if you left and had time to cultivate, you might succeed. But I need you now; thus, I cannot let you go!" Luo Tian spoke coldly. He knew this pill had transcended the category of ordinary pills, even possessing some sentience.

With both hands moving swiftly, Luo Tian reached for the pill again. The pill still resisted, but as it had just been refined, it could only instinctively fight Luo Tian. Though determined, its endurance was insufficient, and it was ultimately caught by Luo Tian.

Luo Tian opened his mouth and swallowed the golden immortal pill. A burst of explosive power immediately erupted in his dantian.

"Ahh..." Luo Tian roared into the sky, the heavens shifting as waves of energy burst forth, tearing through the sky.

"This... Is the power of a Ten-Grade Immortal Pill so terrifying? Even Luo Tian is like this?" The Medicine King was shocked, watching the cracks forming on Luo Tian's body.

Boom...

Booming, Luo Tian activated his heart demon palace to the maximum, refining the wild power while sitting cross-legged in the void.

Golden light flickered, enveloping Luo Tian completely and obscuring the view of the others. He hovered there like a blazing sun, illuminating all directions.

"I will refine this power first. If you cannot withstand it, retreat to Medicine King Mountain!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in Zhang Daotian and the others' ears.

Zhang Daotian and the others relayed Luo Tian's words to Jiang Nanxuan. Da Niu and Er Niu arrived at Medicine King Mountain to guard Luo Tian; this place could not be compromised.

Time passed. Half a month had gone by, and the golden silhouette gradually faded. Da Niu and Er Niu could vaguely see Luo Tian seated there.

But with only two days left until the one month Yang Huanyu had mentioned, Luo Tian could not fully absorb the remaining power.

...

Outside the Eight Ghost Gates of Hell, an endless horde of hellish cultivators stood. If someone could view the entire Immortal Realm from above, they would see hell's forces surrounding it completely.

Outside a dark hall, numerous strongest members of Rebirth Gate stood silently, waiting for the person to emerge. Once that person stepped out, it would be the beginning of chaos.

Squeak...

The massive hall door opened. A figure in black robes emerged, his aura concealed and a determined face. Behind him was a dark war halberd.

"Lord!" A wave of black figures bowed respectfully, gazing at the middle-aged man in black robes.

"Attack!" Yang Huanyu's clear voice rang out, spreading throughout hell. It echoed above the Eight Ghost Gates of Hell.

"Kill..." A deafening roar of battle erupted from all eight ghost gates simultaneously. Countless hellish cultivators began to attack the Eight Ghost Gates.

"Fight!" The Immortal Realm side had already prepared. A wave of figures roared, beginning to resist hell's attack.

In an instant, a battlefield of corpses and blood emerged. This battle of annihilation would leave both the Immortal Realm and Hell devastated, their world severely wounded.

"Come, let me meet my old friend," Yang Huanyu smiled, gazing at his black-robed subordinates. There were over a hundred of them, each an elite with Immortal King cultivation!

Four threshold Immortal Emperors and ten peak Immortal Kings—this was a terrifying force, its strength increasing at an astonishing rate.

"Yes!" Over a hundred figures bowed respectfully. Most had fanatic eyes, for their current strength was due to this man. In their eyes, Yang Huanyu was not a person but a god.

Yang Huanyu ascended into the sky, and black clouds descended. He stood upon them, and over a hundred figures flew up behind him, heading toward the Immortal Realm.

The black clouds moved swiftly. Within half a day, they reached one of hell's ghost gates. The battle cries echoed endlessly as the forces of both realms clashed.

The battlefield was filled with corpses, and within half a day, millions of cultivators had perished. This was no battlefield but a meat grinder; the lives of cultivators seemed worthless.

Yang Huanyu's face bore divine light. He gazed at the bloodied battlefield, standing upon the black clouds and beginning to appreciate it.

"This scene is rare indeed!" Yang Huanyu sighed, not yet attacking. If he did, it would take only one day to annihilate them all.

One day seemed long, but with both sides totaling billions of people, what was that concept? It meant these people were as insignificant as ants before Yang Huanyu.

While Yang Huanyu was appreciating the battle, Tianyuan Sect was in chaos. Numerous jade slips flashed with divine light before Jiang Nanxuan, feeding him the battlefield's news.

"Continuing like this... how long will it take?" Jiang Nanxuan sighed. This was just the beginning; as long as no threshold Immortal Emperor participated in combat, the Immortal Realm still had a chance. Every few hundred years, they could not finish.

"A black cloud is heading toward Tianyuan Sect!" As Jiang Nanxuan sighed, Cao Dedu's voice rang out in the hall, making Jiang Nanxuan solemn.

"Reconnoiter further!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, continuously sending messages to the Immortal Realm's elites, urging those above Immortal King to head toward Tianyuan Sect.

"The black cloud is moving fast, even beyond the limits of sight!"

"Reconnoiter further!"

"Distance to Tianyuan Sect: one million li..."

"Fifty thousand li..." Cao Dedu's voice kept coming, filled with urgency.

"Ten thousand li. It has stopped. There are nearly a hundred Immortal Kings on it. Yang Huanyu leads them!" Finally, Cao Dedu's voice ceased, causing the people in the hall to gasp.

The black cloud floated ten thousand li away from Tianyuan Sect. Yang Huanyu stood upon it, gazing toward the direction of Tianyuan Sect. His brow furrowed slightly as he turned his gaze elsewhere, that direction being Medicine King Mountain. A smile appeared in Yang Huanyu's eyes.

"Indeed, you have not disappointed me. Your Dao Fruit, I shall claim it. I can wait!" Yang Huanyu spoke softly, watching the streams of light from all directions heading toward Tianyuan Sect.

"What's going on? Why has it stopped? If he comes, we will all be wiped out!" In Tianyuan Sect's hall, people were confused.

Time flowed slowly. A day passed with the black cloud remaining in the sky without action, but its oppressive pressure made Tianyuan Sect's people uneasy.

"This old man, what is he up to?" Cao Dedu and Sun Kelnian whispered. At this moment, Tianyuan Sect was filled with elites; most of the Immortal Realm's Immortal Kings had gathered there, about seventy or eighty people.

"He wants to wipe us all out, waiting for us to gather all our elites at Tianyuan Sect!" Jiang Nanxuan realized Yang Huanyu's intention.

Sigh... This was a direct battle. If they were all eliminated, the Eight Ghost Gates' battlefield would have no doubt.

As Tianyuan Sect's people anxiously waited, the heavens roared from another direction.

"Begin! He should be returning!" Yang Huanyu spoke, addressing his hundred Immortal Kings.

"Yes!" In an instant, the Rebirth Gate's elites who had been waiting restrainedly leaped from the black clouds and rushed toward Tianyuan Sect.

"They're coming!"

"Four threshold Immortal Emperors, how did they appear!" Tianyuan Sect's people watched the crowd rushing toward them and shattered the heavens.

"How can we resist? Da Niu and Er Niu are not here!" In an instant, the people were desperate.

"Yang Huanyu!" As Tianyuan Sect's people despaired, three figures ascended into the sky—Luo Tian, Da Niu, and Er Niu.

"I've been waiting for you long enough!" Yang Huanyu smiled lightly, as if it were expected. His gaze fell upon Luo Tian's arrival.

"Finally returned! Luo Tian has come back!"

"Has he broken through?" In an instant, the people of Tianyuan Sect were in uproar. Their eyes fell upon Luo Tian standing above Tianyuan Sect.

"Failure is not a disgrace!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, standing there. His aura was still unstable but more formidable than before.

The Immortal Realm's people were invigorated. Now they still had a chance to fight!

"Kill!"

The deafening roar echoed as Black and White Death waved their hands, causing the black wheel to emit a crackling sound. It spun rapidly and slashed toward one of the threshold Immortal Emperors.

"Today's battle, if we win, the world will be at peace. If we lose, blood shall stain the world!" The Immortal Realm's people roared, howling fiercely. Though they were outnumbered, they faced no fear.

"I shall rule the world with Rebirth Gate!" The Rebirth Gate's elites also roared. A hulking figure wielding a sword with a sharp tip, his body covered in long hair, led the charge toward the Immortal Realm's people.

"Luo Tian! Today I shall kill all your family to avenge the battle at the Sea of Corpses and Ice Plains!" This figure was Yin Xuanbing, the Corpse King from the Sea of Corpses and Ice Plains.

The heavens cracked. In an instant, a voice echoed across the world. A terrifying fluctuation caused both sides to clash in battle. This was a battlefield that determined the future fate of the world, and with this battlefield's opening, the entire world was filled with fighting.

"Is this what you wanted?" Luo Tian gazed at Yang Huanyu, speaking softly. The two stood beneath the heavens, none could have imagined that they would face each other again in this manner after their past battles on Tianyuan Continent.

"This is fate!" Yang Huanyu spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian. Their auras rose, and the heavens roared with thunder.

As their auras spread, both sides' forces paused momentarily. Their eyes were filled with fear as they gazed toward the two.

"Even their aura is unbearable for the Immortal Realm's laws!" The people gasped, eyes filled with awe. The two stood there, challenging the heavens.

A booming sound echoed before them. Neither had attacked yet, but it seemed they had already done so. The loud voice even overshadowed all collisions.

In an instant, both men ascended into the star domain. Luo Tian extended his hand and a crackling spear appeared in it.

Guided by fate, Yang Huanyu also took off his Yellowness War Halberd and smiled.

"What a beautiful starry sky. Unfortunately, it will all cease to exist!" Yang Huanyu laughed softly and stepped into the stars, vanishing from his original position.

"I will protect it!" Luo Tian responded. There was nothing more to say now; only a battle remained.

Crack...

A deafening collision sound erupted. The two appeared before each other in midair, a spear and halberd colliding. Sparks flew everywhere, and the collision site shattered the stars.

Their bodies reversed, and Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu retreated several ten thousand zhang. Luo Tian took a deep breath.

Yang Huanyu swung his long halberd, and the sound of Dao rules roared. He rushed toward Luo Tian again. Luo Tian was undeterred, and the two continuously attacked. In the starry domain, their movements were invisible; only the sound of clashing weapons could be heard.

One moment... two moments...

After ten moments, Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu appeared again, separated by ten thousand zhang. Their eyes still gazed at each other.

"World Shadow!" Yang Huanyu chanted with his hands, and black qi surged. A phantom appeared behind him.

"Phantom Form!"

"World!" Luo Tian spoke, his body suddenly expanding. In an instant, it grew to over ten thousand zhang in size. A powerful aura suppressed all directions.

"What is your true goal? Do you truly believe there's immortality?" Luo Tian roared, taking a step forward and shattering the heavens toward Yang Huanyu.

"Once I believed it, but now I don't. Because I am immortality itself. Follow me and live!" Yang Huanyu shouted, a world phantom striking Luo Tian's descending foot.

Chapter 2806: Confronting Yang Huanyu

A punch and a kick, continuously clashing. Seven collisions shattered Luo Tian's seven steps of the body. His massive phantom retreated.

Luo Tian spat blood, gazing at Yang Huanyu who also retreated. His eyes were serious; he had just entered the Emperor's realm, and was slightly behind Yang Huanyu.

"If I had a few more days to stabilize my cultivation, it wouldn't be this way!" Luo Tian thought to himself and attacked again, raising his hand toward Yang Huanyu.

"Roar..."

In the roar, a black hole rose in the starry domain. A massive creature emerged from the darkness, it was a thousand-zhang-long beast with fierce horns and black claws. It rushed toward Yang Huanyu.

"You've improved, but it's still not enough!" Yang Huanyu wiped the blood from his lips and pointed a thick finger toward the black beast.

The sound of collisions erupted. The black beast roared and was pierced by the finger, disintegrating into divine fragments scattered across the stars.

...The beast's destruction did not surprise Luo Tian. His massive body vanished, and a black crackling spear appeared in his hand. His speed surged to its peak, appearing before Yang Huanyu and thrusting the spear toward the heart of Yang Huanyu's world phantom.

The world phantom grabbed the black crackling spear with its hand. However, the powerful impact caused Yang Huanyu to retreat continuously. The massive world phantom shattered stars.

After flying nearly ten thousand zhang, Yang Huanyu stopped. He punched toward Luo Tian.

Dao rules appeared on Yang Huanyu's fist, a terrifying aura spreading. More shocking was the six whirlpools on Yang Huanyu's fist—six reincarnation forces. Luo Tian had no time to ponder why Yang Huanyu possessed six reincarnation forces, and with his other hand, he clenched a fist. Six reincarnations combined with the chaotic wind to strike.

One... two... sixteen punches collided, this punch was earth-shattering. Sixteen times the physical strength had reached the peak of chaotic wind. Even Lu Chong's performance could only reach fifteen times the physical strength.

At the Emperor level, any martial arts in Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu's hands were at their peak, achieving maximum power. In a flash of lightning and fire, the two massive fists collided. The stars around them continuously exploded, sending Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu flying apart again.

"It's my turn!" This time, Yang Huanyu took the initiative. He snapped his fingers, and a stream of light flew from his hand.

"Chess pieces!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. He slammed his hands downward, creating a barrier before him.

Boom...

The black chess pieces struck the barrier but pierced it and continued toward Luo Tian.

"What is this?" Luo Tian was surprised. His massive body twisted, five blood flowers blooming on his body. Black light pierced through him, causing Luo Tian to gasp.

"Divine Storehouse!" A cold voice rang out. A massive ancient coffin appeared beneath the stars, radiating an aura that suppressed everything and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Let me open!" Luo Tian had just been injured, though his wounds healed quickly, it still affected his movement. He could only endure.

Luo Tian roared and extended both hands to the sky, allowing the heavy coffin to descend upon him.

Boom... Luo Tian's body rapidly descended like a meteor, sinking deeper and deeper. The massive coffin also wore down under Luo Tian's resistance.

"Month Eclipse!" Yang Huanyu's right eye suddenly changed to a blood-red moon. Before Luo Tian could stabilize, the entire starry domain darkened and turned into endless blackness. A blood-red moon appeared, casting red light that covered the stars.

Luo Tian had just stabilized when the blood-red moon pressed down again, striking Luo Tian's body. His massive form could no longer withstand it and shattered with a thunderous explosion, causing Luo Tian to spit blood and fall into the depths of space.

As he fell, Luo Tian's eyes glowed. Thunder surged, and countless lightning bolts pierced the dark starry domain, illuminating it and restoring normalcy. Luo Tian also steadied his body under the lightning, with three-colored thunder dragons roaring toward Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu slapped his hand, and a black cloud roared forward, emitting an earth-shaking aura toward Luo Tian. The black clouds approached and absorbed the thunder dragons, as if they were nourishing the cloud.

Luo Tian roared into the sky and emitted a suction force, swallowing the vast black clouds.

"Shen Tian's martial arts—Swallowing Heaven?" Yang Huanyu's gaze finally changed, his eyes filled with surprise.

Roar...

Yang Huanyu was surprised. Luo Tian opened his mouth and spat out a black current, accompanied by thunderous sounds. The current surged toward Yang Huanyu with lightning power and a piercing roar, shaking the stars.

"Burial of Gods!" Yang Huanyu extended his hands and a massive ancient coffin appeared with a thunderous sound.

Crack...

As the coffin appeared, Yang Huanyu clasped his hands and the massive coffin enclosed him and his phantom.

Boom... The black current collided with the coffin, submerging it. In Luo Tian's view, the coffin was gradually worn down.

After ten moments, the current spewed by Luo Tian disappeared. Yang Huanyu also reappeared in Luo Tian's view.

Luo Tian took heavy breaths, gazing at Yang Huanyu. The world phantom had not yet disintegrated.

"Supplementing Heaven Stone!" Luo Tian roared and rushed toward Yang Huanyu again. His forehead's flame mark flickered, and brilliant flames erupted from his body, forming a line of fire dragons toward Yang Huanyu.

"Master, I can only fight once. Once I disperse this world phantom, I will retreat!" A voice echoed. A red fire stone appeared behind Yang Huanyu and rushed toward him.

"Interesting!" Yang Huanyu, facing two overwhelming attacks, did not panic. The world phantom's hands formed a gesture and the sound of Dao rules roared, suddenly turning to strike the fire stone behind him.

In an instant, the world phantom's fist struck the supplementing heaven stone. A crackling sound followed, and the massive body of the supplementing heaven stone was shattered by the world phantom's fist. It flew away, appearing ready to break.

The supplementing heaven stone attack had worked; the world phantom was also more transparent. It was attacked by fire dragons.

Heavenly fire burned everything, and in an instant, the entire world phantom turned into flames. Yang Huanyu's body was also engulfed in fire.

The fire receded, and the world phantom disappeared. Yang Huanyu's body appeared in a corner of the starry domain, his robes still bearing spots of fire.

Chapter 2807: Return of Immortality

The entire world was filled with blood. The Eight Ghost Gates had rivers of blood, and corpses piled up like mountains. Even with the presence of corpse-eaters, they could not keep up with the speed at which corpses were produced.

Above Tianyuan Sect, the void cracked as if it had entered an apocalypse. Nearly two hundred Immortal Kings fought, and even threshold Emperors joined in—enough to destroy everything. However, as time passed, the Tianyuan Sect side gradually became overwhelmed.

Immortal Kings fell, and even threshold Emperors were about to bleed. Black and White Death fought swiftly, battling two threshold Emperors. Though they were powerful, at the level of a threshold Emperor, their strength was nearly equal. Fighting two against one was difficult and they were beaten to blood.

"Stay strong!" Black and White Death roared internally, continuously howling. At this moment, Long Jie and Yao Chen still held out. If they died, two threshold Emperors would be enough to annihilate all of Tianyuan Sect.

The battlefield was evenly matched. Once one point broke, the balance would be instantly shattered, especially in the battles of Immortal Kings and threshold Emperors. The most critical factor was Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu's fight—whichever won would determine the battle's victory, deciding which side of the Immortal Realm and Hell would prevail.

Under the stars, two figures continuously clashed. A day for Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu felt like an era. Their attacks were so fast that they seemed to transcend time, unbound by it.

"Why? Why have you caused the Immortal Realm and Hell to spill blood?" Luo Tian roared, thrusting his spear toward Yang Huanyu's Yellowness War Halberd. His body was pushed back by Yang Huanyu.

"I naturally have my own goals!" Yang Huanyu swung his halberd across, and the two clashed again. The clash shook all heavens.

"Can't you kill me? Are you trying to steal my Emperor's Seal?" Luo Tian replied, sensing that if they continued like this, it would take until the end of time to determine a winner.

"Can't you kill me?"

"I am who I am. I would not do something without absolute confidence!" Yang Huanyu smiled, extending his hand to grasp five streams of light from behind Luo Tian. These were the five chess pieces that had pierced Luo Tian's body before.

Luo Tian instantly felt a sense of danger, but the five pieces still struck him. Blood flew again.

"Unpredictable!" Luo Tian sighed, not having time to think further. His spear transformed into a flurry of gun shadows before him, clashing with Yang Huanyu's halberd.

Luo Tian was somewhat passive but could still withstand Yang Huanyu's attacks. As time passed, his cultivation became more stable, and the power of his attacks increased.

"What other secrets do you have?" Luo Tian's mind was serious. He knew Yang Huanyu rarely acted without confidence.

Half an hour passed in the blink of an eye. Both men had injuries of varying sizes.

"It's time to return..." Yang Huanyu stood beneath the stars, murmuring softly. His gaze turned toward the vast starry domain.

Rippling...

Luo Tian, however, did not care. Three lightning bolts struck toward Yang Huanyu, thinking something had changed and it was better to end it quickly, even if he died.

Buzz...

At the same time as Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu's fierce battle, a bloodlight streaked from the star domain, shattering stars.

In an instant, red light reached Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu's vicinity. Luo Tian was stunned.

A blood-red flower hovered in the starry domain, standing on it was an old man. He wore a green robe but his body radiated red light, his eyes filled with madness, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian!" The old man gritted his teeth and directly extended his hand toward Luo Tian.

"Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life!" Luo Tian exclaimed, watching the old figure standing there. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian clearly remembered that the Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life had been struck by his palm lightning and completely annihilated. How could he appear again?

Not only did he appear, but he had also advanced to the Emperor level. Now he could be called the Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life.

Boom... Luo Tian punched, shattering the old man's hand and retreating. His eyes were more serious.

"Can I kill you now?" Yang Huanyu spoke, striking Luo Tian with his halberd.

"Something's wrong. His mind is controlled!" Luo Tian carefully observed the Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life and then felt a tremor in his heart.

"How could it be? Who can control an Emperor-level strength!" Luo Tian was shocked, gazing at Yang Huanyu. The result was clear—everything was controlled by Yang Huanyu, otherwise he would not have been so confident.

"Truly terrifying..." Luo Tian retreated. One Yang Huanyu was enough to trouble him, but now there was also an Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life. If it weren't for the necessity to fight, Luo Tian might have already fled.

Buzz...

Luo Tian retreated. The Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life and Yang Huanyu pressed forward relentlessly, continuously launching attacks toward Luo Tian.

This time, Luo Tian dared not endure. He dodged as he ran wildly through the starry domain.

"If you keep running, I'll have him turn back and kill the people of Tianyuan Sect!" Yang Huanyu saw Luo Tian fleeing, laughing coldly. Though they were enemies, they knew each other best.

Hearing Yang Huanyu's words, Luo Tian suddenly stopped. His eyes turned blood-red, and his body emitted a crackling sound.

"Body Dissolution of the Heavenly Demon?" Yang Huanyu's eyes slightly narrowed, his smile more intense. He stopped beneath the stars and rapidly moved his hands, emitting a deafening sound of thunder from his hands.

In an instant, a chessboard appeared and covered the entire starry domain. The board's rules flowed, with pieces moving chaotically. A terrifying pressure spread.

"World Chessboard!" Yang Huanyu roared, and the pieces on the board began to move with rules. The terrifying pressure became even more alarming, making Luo Tian feel a strong crisis.

"Gate of Eternal Life!" The Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life also roared, and a green door with blood patterns appeared. It carried an earth-shaking power and pressed down.

Luo Tian roared, but under Yang Huanyu and the Immortal Emperor of Eternal Life's attacks, his body trembled uncontrollably.

The power was too strong. Even with the Body Dissolution of the Heavenly Demon, his strength had increased slightly, but against their decisive attack, he knew he might not withstand it.

Three-colored lightning converged in Luo Tian's palm, distorting space and emitting an earth-shaking aura.

"It's not enough!" Luo Tian thought to himself. He communicated with the Supplementing Heaven Stone and added four more lightning bolts, which fell into his palm and merged into the distorted space.

Boom... A wild aura erupted from Luo Tian's palm. Seven lightning bolts converged, their power capable of destroying heaven and earth.

At the same time as all three were preparing their attacks, a figure broke through the shattered heavens and stood beneath the starry domain.

"Luo Tian! I'm here to help you!"
