"Your Highness, Third Sixty-First Prince has died... Your Highness... Forty-Fourth Prince has also perished..." In the following days, Luo Tian and Luo Shui continued to strike within the Lord's Mansion, continuing their slaughter of Duan Zijue's forces. Each time they killed, Duan Zijue would appear but could never find their hiding places.

These days, Duan Zijue heard the most harrowing news: his sons and daughters were dying one by one. Within just a few days, half of them had already met their end.

The entire Lord's Mansion was in chaos, especially Duan Zijue's children, who trembled with fear. They knew that the Heavenly Demon King had perhaps provoked someone he shouldn't have.

"Did you hear? Duan Peng and the Eighteenth Young Miss were caught in an affair, then severed in two by a single strike! His corpse was discovered by his father!" Duan Zijue's children whispered anxiously, their hearts pounding with dread. They feared they might be the next targets.

"Bring them all to me! I'll see how he dares strike under my very nose!" The Heavenly Demon King was at his wit's end. He had no other choice but to gather the remaining sixty-plus children into his quarters. Naturally, they were eager to comply. They all arrived at a grand hall where the Heavenly Demon King resided, for nothing was more precious than their lives.

The Heavenly Demon King gazed at the dozens of his offspring, a mixture of awe and sorrow in his eyes. He had never imagined he had so many children—half were already dead.

"Now, see if he dares strike again! Once he shows himself, I'll annihilate him immediately!" The Heavenly Demon King's mind seethed with cold laughter.

"Report... Chief Du has died..." Just as the Heavenly Demon King sneered, another voice rang out. The news struck him like a thunderclap.

The Heavenly Demon King gasped, his body trembling violently. The oppressive atmosphere in the hall left his children speechless, their chests heavy with dread.

"He intends to kill every person in my Lord's Mansion!" The Heavenly Demon King gritted his teeth, fury boiling within him. He hadn't been so enraged in years. The enemy was like a mouse, elusive even to him.

Yet the Heavenly Demon King could only sigh in frustration. If he had caught them, he would have already done so.

"Think of a plan—this can't go on!" The Heavenly Demon King's mind raced, his eyes flashing with determination.

"Du Long, you'll go out and escort me!" Duan Zijue commanded a young man with authority.

"Yes!" The young man, summoned by Duan Zijue, felt his heart race but dared not disobey. Without further preparation, Du Long soon left the Lord's Mansion. Duan Zijue vanished into the hall, while Du Gao remained to protect them all. After all, if they were wiped out, Duan Zijue would have nowhere to weep.

"Out he went! He actually left the Lord's Mansion!" Bu Tian Shi's voice of surprise echoed in Luo Tian and Luo Shui's minds.

"Damn, I'm rich!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed. He ignored the others and ordered Bu Tian Shi to fly directly toward the Heavenly Demon King's treasure vault, determined to raze it.

Chapter 2201: Withdrawal

"Hey, let's talk about how we split it," Bu Tian Shi immediately perked up when the topic of the Heavenly Demon King's treasure arose.

If not for Luo Tian's restraint, Bu Tian Shi would have already stormed the vault. Even the Reincarnation Hall's treasure vault had eluded him—what could a Heavenly Demon King's vault offer?

"Eighty-two split. I take eight, you two!" Luo Tian declared without hesitation. This was because Bu Tian Shi had aided him these days; otherwise, he would have given nothing to Bu Tian Shi. The latter was too cunning—once careless, he'd be outwitted and possibly betrayed.

"What? You're too harsh! I've been running back and forth these days—without me, would you have succeeded so smoothly?"

"You only give me two parts? That's too much! Two parts aren't even enough to plug my teeth!" Bu Tian Shi protested.

"You've sold me out so many times—didn't you take from the Reincarnation Hall's vault too?"

"Of course! That was my own hard-earned gains. I take seven, you three—no less! If you give me any less, I'll expose you. Let's see if the Heavenly Demon King will kill you!" Luo Tian and Bu Tian Shi exchanged barbs, neither yielding. Luo Shui's lips twitched in exasperation.

"What did my son do in the Reincarnation Hall?" Luo Shui gazed at Luo Tian, their conversation revealing some of his secrets—like stealing the Reincarnation Hall's vault. Even as a True Immortal at peak level, Luo Shui was astounded by Luo Tian's audacity.

"Hey, you two arguing like that—what if the Heavenly Demon King returns soon?" Luo Shui sighed, exasperated.

"Uh..." Upon hearing Luo Shui's words, both Luo Tian and Bu Tian Shi fell silent.

"Let's take what we need!" Luo Tian commanded, ordering Bu Tian Shi to locate the Heavenly Demon King's treasure vault.

Luo Tian had to admire Bu Tian Shi—within half a bell, he found the vault's location.

As for the outer barriers, Bu Tian Shi ignored them entirely and appeared within the barrier instantly. Upon entering the vault, Luo Tian's eyes lit up with delight.

The treasure hall spanned ten thousand feet, brimming with treasures that left Luo Tian dazzled. Yet he was certain every item here was no common treasure—herbs, talismans, weapons.

"Roar!" Bu Tian Shi didn't hesitate, his maw wide open. A powerful suction force erupted from his mouth, drawing in countless treasures. After a few chomps, he lunged for more.

"Damn, you're shameless!" Luo Tian cursed, leaping out and landing within the vault. Without hesitation, he waved his hand, sending a wave of treasures vanishing from sight.

"Dad, why are you just standing there? Come down and grab some!" Luo Tian called out to the void, surprising Luo Shui.

"Don't care about anything—just grab what you can!"

"Otherwise, this stone will eat it all!" Luo Tian urged Luo Shui. His hands were busy, ignoring everything—Luo Tian had no intention of leaving a single thing for the Heavenly Demon King.

"Okay!" Luo Shui nodded, leaping out to begin collecting treasures.

"You two are too despicable!" Bu Tian Shi grumbled, his maw wide open. The three of them competed to empty the vault, even stripping the floor tiles bare.

Meanwhile, Duan Zijue had left the Lord's Mansion secretly, following Du Long to await Luo Tian and his son.

After waiting two hours with no movement, Duan Zijue realized the enemy would not fall for another trap.

"Ah, if I had just confronted him directly from the start, there wouldn't have been so much trouble!" Duan Zijue sighed inwardly, signaling Du Long to return home.

Upon hearing Duan Zijue's words, Du Long felt his heart lighten. Within a moment, he returned to the Lord's Mansion.

As soon as he entered, Duan Zijue cast a domain over the entire Lord's Mansion to check for any changes.

"Hmm?"

"Not a single person dead?" Under the domain's coverage, Duan Zijue was surprised. Though his sons were protected by Du Gao, others in the mansion had no protection—logically, the hidden assassin should have taken this chance to kill.

"Could he have left?" The Heavenly Demon King considered a possibility, his eyes flickering with hope.

"Something feels off..."

"Damn it—this is the treasure vault!" The Heavenly Demon King's face darkened instantly. He vanished from his spot.

"Father, what's wrong?" Du Long furrowed his brow in confusion as he stepped toward the Heavenly Demon King's quarters.

"Die..." Just as Du Long was puzzled, a cold voice echoed behind him. A blade flashed, cleaving through Du Long's body. Blood splattered onto the stone floor.

His gray soul disintegrated, and Luo Tian and Luo Shui vanished in an instant.

Du Long never expected to survive the first but not the fifteenth—his fate was sealed.

Yet even if the Heavenly Demon King had sensed it, he had no time to care about Du Long's death.

In the empty and dark space, Duan Zijue glared at the excavated ground. The treasure vault was reduced to a single barrier, leaving nothing for the Heavenly Demon King.

The Heavenly Demon King felt like vomiting—this was his life's savings, containing many irreplaceable treasures. It was his foundation, surpassing even his children. All had been wiped out by Luo Tian in one go.

"God damn you..." The furious voice echoed through the Heavenly Demon King's city, shaking its people.

"That's the Heavenly Demon King's voice!"

"My god, he's been driven to curse! Even the Beast Demon King who came before couldn't achieve this. I've never heard the Heavenly Demon King curse before—what did that person do?" The city's people murmured.

"They say the assassin infiltrated the Lord's Mansion and killed people. Now, the Heavenly Demon King's children are fewer than half!"

"Wow, that assassin is really ruthless. Who did the Heavenly Demon King offend?"

"They say even the Heavenly Demon King can't find him!" The city's people gazed toward the Lord's Mansion, astonished. How could a mid-level Immortal King be so thoroughly defeated by an assassin?

Yet the people only heard the Heavenly Demon King's furious roar. After that, there was no more sound.

At this moment, in the Heavenly Demon King's hall, Duan Zijue's face was dark as a tomb. His gaze swept over the people in the hall.

"Stay here quietly until I find a way to deal with him!" Duan Zijue spoke solemnly, then vanished from their sight.

"What's going on?" Duan Zijue's children looked puzzled, but Du Gao guessed something.

"He's planning to deal with me!" Luo Tian and Luo Shui stood on Bu Tian Shi, their brows furrowed.

"Dust, we should retreat. The Heavenly Demon King is a mid-level Immortal King—should he go all out, we might be in danger!" Luo Shui urged. Having killed so many of the Heavenly Demon King's children, his resentment had eased somewhat.

"Right. But I vowed to make him childless—so he must be!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with determination, beginning to plan again.

This was a game of wits between Luo Tian and the Heavenly Demon King. The next move would determine whether the Heavenly Demon King could catch Luo Tian or if Luo Tian could achieve his goal. For Luo Tian, it was a matter of life and death—yet he felt his chances were better than ever.

Time passed, and Luo Tian continued to kill people within the Lord's Mansion daily, plunging it into chaos. This chaos surpassed even when the Beast Demon King had caused trouble—no one knew who would be next.

Since the Heavenly Demon King disappeared, he had never returned, as if indifferent to those who died. Soon, the Lord's Mansion was filled with cries of despair, and some even fled.

The mansion exuded a cold, desolate atmosphere; people were noticeably fewer than before.

First, the Beast Demon King came daily to cause trouble, killing many. After he left, another "father" arrived—no one could find him. During this time, the Lord's Mansion people were exhausted.

A month passed. One day, a cold and authoritative voice echoed in the ears of the people, shaking them deeply.

"Buzz..." The domain descended. The Heavenly Demon King stood above the Lord's Mansion, gazing at its reduced population and chaos. His eyes flashed with coldness.

"The Heavenly Demon King has returned! He must have found a solution!" The Lord's Mansion people's faces changed instantly.

"Everyone, evacuate Tian Demon City within half an hour!" The Heavenly Demon King stood there, his vast domain enveloping the Lord's Mansion. He believed no movement would escape his perception.

"Is this the time to strike? I wish I had killed him before he became a hollow king!" Luo Tian sighed, watching the Lord's Mansion people move. He whispered to himself before commanding Bu Tian Shi to fly toward the hall where the Heavenly Demon King's children resided.

"First, a grand gift for you!" Luo Tian waved his hand, producing a golden banner. It flew from his hands and appeared in the corner of the hall.

The golden banner was planted into the ground, and a thunderous roar erupted overhead. Black judgment clouds descended.

"Hmm?" The Heavenly Demon King furrowed his brow, gazing at the black clouds over the hall. His eyes held confusion.

Chapter 2202: Departure

"Could it be one of my sons has ascended? Is he about to undergo a trial?" The Heavenly Demon King shifted his attention to the hall. But instantly, he noticed the banner on the ground and his eyes flickered with surprise.

"Crash..." As the Heavenly Demon King was confused, lightning dragons from the clouds surged downward toward the hall.

"It's a formation!"

"Disperse!" The Heavenly Demon King sneered, releasing a powerful pressure that swept over the hall. The thunder had shattered the hall but was instantly twisted and dispersed.

"This is the Heavenly Demon King's strength?" Luo Tian, hiding in a corner, marveled at how he could unravel even the Celestial Punishment Formation.

The lightning vanished, and the Heavenly Demon King's children emerged from the hall, their eyes filled with relief. They had felt the suffocating pressure within the hall.

"Move aside!" The Heavenly Demon King sneered, directing people to evacuate the Lord's Mansion. He observed the domain's changes and, upon finding no suspicious figures leaving, felt satisfied.

An hour passed, and the entire Lord's Mansion was emptied. Everyone or creatures were taken out by the Lord's Mansion people, their speed remarkable.

Luo Tian also took advantage of the chaos to leave the Lord's Mansion. The entire mansion was now under the Heavenly Demon King's vast domain, leaving only him alone.

"He should still be here," the Heavenly Demon King sneered, his hands moving swiftly. Green energy surged from his palms, instantly enveloping the entire Lord's Mansion.

The void trembled, the sky darkened. People's faces showed fear as they watched the mansion shrouded in green energy. They could sense that anything touched by this green aura would suffer dire consequences.

Thick green mist exuded a corrosive intent, seeping everywhere and even penetrating the void. The entire Lord's Mansion became a toxic world.

"Sky-toxic Domain!" The Heavenly Demon King roared, the invisible domain gradually turning green. His hands conjured again, and purple mist spilled from his palms.

"The Heavenly Demon King is trying to poison the assassin to death!"

"He must be dead for sure. This toxin can't be resisted by anyone below the Immortal King level!" People marveled, watching the domain turn three colors.

The entire Heavenly Demon King City turned lifeless and gloomy; any living being within the Lord's Mansion was poisoned to death, devoid of vitality.

"You're such a fool!" Luo Tian watched the confident Duan Zijue in the mansion, shaking his head. He had thought the Heavenly Demon King would have a clever plan, but it was just this clumsy move.

"Now that I've seen your tricks, let me show you my methods!" Luo Tian smiled, his hands moving swiftly to deliver the second grand gift to the Heavenly Demon King.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian's hand seals fell, a thunderous roar echoed in the sky. A massive figure descended from above, its eyes crimson, charging toward the Heavenly Demon King's children.

This was just the beginning—numerous black figures rushed forward like mad, their sole purpose to kill the Heavenly Demon King's children.

Covered in toxic spines, with twin horns and a powerful aura, they descended from the sky. A yellow dragon emerged from its mouth, corroding heaven and earth, making Du Gao's face pale.

"Is this not the Heavenly Demon King's reared soul-piercing ghosts? What's happening—why are these ghosts so mad?" The Lord's Mansion people panicked, watching the endless horde of ghosts rushing toward them.

"Also, there are soul-piercing ravens; both have near-Immortal King strength!" People gasped, watching the ghosts rush toward the remaining dozens of the Heavenly Demon King's children.

Thousands of them, each with True Immortal strength, and countless more at the Immortal level. In an instant, people were stunned. No one expected these ghosts to suddenly go mad and charge toward the Heavenly Demon King's people.

"What's going on?" Du Gao's face darkened as he met the soul-piercing ghost's attack. But no one could stop the raven's assault.

The dozens of Heavenly Demon King's children were paralyzed with fear, instantly engulfed and overwhelmed by the ravens and ghosts.

The entire Heavenly Demon King City turned chaotic, with ghosts running wild and screams echoing.

"Damn it!" The Heavenly Demon King's face darkened. He noticed the ghosts' uprising instantly, but even if he wanted to rescue them, it would take time. That time cost his children their lives.

Pressure surged; the Heavenly Demon King knew the assassin wasn't in the Lord's Mansion. He appeared instantly above the chaos, his overwhelming pressure subduing the rampaging ghosts.

"Ah..." The Heavenly Demon King cried out, though the ghosts didn't dare attack under his domain. His children were left with only two or three survivors, trembling in fear.

Two men and one woman—neither their strength nor their worth was great, but sheer luck. Even the Heavenly Demon King hadn't remembered their names.

"Boom boom boom..."

An Immortal King's fury shook the world, turning countless black ghosts into swirling dark mist.

"Damn it, come out!" The Heavenly Demon King raged, his fury causing heavy losses in the Heavenly Demon King City.

Boom boom boom... The Heavenly Demon King's hands struck repeatedly, shattering the void. But it was all in vain; Luo Tian had already slipped out of the Heavenly Demon King City during the chaos.

"The final grand gift!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a smile as he moved his hands, etching black hand seals into the void outside the Heavenly Demon King City.

"Crash..." Nine-color flames erupted, a dazzling firestorm descending from the void. The Fire-Devouring Formation swept down, and even with the Heavenly Demon King's domain, the nine-color flames pierced through it, descending into the city.

"Boom..." The firestorm engulfed everything, nine-color flames capable of igniting all things. No matter what it touched, it would burn.

The entire Heavenly Demon King City seemed to plunge into the apocalypse. The Heavenly Demon King's eyes were bloodshot, watching the flames descend. He spat out a mouthful of blood, his terrifying domain expanding rapidly to envelop the entire city.

The world's power surged throughout the vast Heavenly Demon King City, subduing the flames—though briefly, the losses were catastrophic. The city echoed with cries of despair, as if ravaged by the apocalypse.

"From heaven to hell, I'll kill you!" The Heavenly Demon King roared, his voice shaking the sky and earth. Everyone could hear the fury in his voice.

Yet people also heard exhaustion in his voice—this past month had drained him greatly.

"Go ahead and catch me if you dare!" Luo Tian stood on the crimson earth, his eyes filled with contempt. He smiled inwardly but didn't dare show himself. Instead, he ordered Bu Tian Shi to fly toward the Beast Demon King's city, moving at a safe pace.

Time passed; after half a month, Luo Tian and Luo Shui finally stepped off Bu Tian Shi, arriving at the Beast Demon King's city.

During these days, forces near the Heavenly Demon King City were all discussing its affairs—such a commotion was too loud, even reaching the Beast Demon King's city and another adjacent Yuan Demon King's city.

"It's truly tragic—over a hundred sons and daughters, now only three remain... and they seem like fools. The Heavenly Demon King's lineage might become the weakest among the Eight Kings!"

"That assassin is truly ruthless, killing even the Heavenly Demon King without capture! But these past days, he's disappeared—probably stopped. Don't let him come to our Beast Demon King City!" Luo Tian overheard the people's gossip in the Beast Demon King's city, a smile on his face.

"Save the rest for later—I'll destroy this Heavenly Demon King when I'm strong enough!" Luo Tian muttered, while Luo Shui also sighed, changing their appearances to walk through the Beast Demon King's city.

As soon as Luo Tian entered the Beast Demon King's city, he contacted Ye Chen, who had been waiting there. He arrived at Ye Chen's inn.

These days, Ye Chen had been trembling with fear, listening to the people's gossip in the inn. He was certain eight out of ten chances were that Luo Tian had done it. Ye Chen hadn't expected Luo Tian to cause such a commotion.

Ye Chen dared not go out, staying in the inn to cultivate, fearing people would discover him. If they noticed, it might lead them to Luo Tian—too conspicuous.

"You..." Ye Chen looked at Luo Tian and Luo Shui, surprised they had walked in boldly.

"Prepare yourself—we're going to the Gate of Hell!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Ye Chen.

On the way, Luo Tian and Luo Shui had already planned. Originally, Luo Tian wanted to take Luo Shui to the Immortal Realm, but Luo Shui refused. He preferred the Gate of Hell since Du Tianming was there—no matter how far the Heavenly Demon King's reach, it couldn't extend to the Gate of Hell.

"Okay!" Ye Chen didn't ask, recognizing from Luo Tian's eyes that all those events were done by Luo Tian.

"Go openly, no problems! I've already sent a message to the Beast Demon King," Luo Tian smiled, not meeting the Beast Demon King. After all, there might be spies from the Heavenly Demon King in the Beast Demon King's city—exposing himself would be bad.

Ye Chen was amazed by Luo Tian's connections, surprised he had such a relationship with the Beast Demon King. Yet he was also puzzled—why did Luo Tian, who had such a status in Hell, still go to the Gate of Hell?

Chapter 2203: Arrival at the Gate of Hell

The Gate of Hell, one of the Nine Ghost Gates, was located in the northern part of the Beast Demon King's city. It was also one of Hell's portals, a gateway for the Immortal Realm to enter Hell—others couldn't tear through space.

Black earth stretched beneath three figures walking: Luo Tian, Luo Shui, and Ye Chen. After a month's journey, they finally reached the Gate of Hell.

Thick mist drifted in the sky, and a towering battle spirit and blood aura filled the air. A heavy atmosphere passed through the air.

"Front is the Gate of Hell. Once inside, be careful with your words and actions!" Luo Shui advised Luo Tian and Ye Chen, explaining some precautions. It was roughly similar to the rules in Bu Tian City.

"Right. We won't stay long here. Once inside, we'll go kill enemies ourselves!" Luo Tian nodded. He knew the only way back was through the Gate of Hell to Bu Tian City.

Luo Shui fell silent, finally sighing deeply. He knew this parting might be forever.

Ye Chen was excited—years had passed since he last returned to the Immortal Realm. Now, only a slight distance remained before reaching the Immortal Realm. Once past this ghost gate and through the vast battlefield, it would be Bu Tian City.

As they spoke, the three arrived at the Gate of Hell's entrance. Armies stationed in Hell were there—these forces also belonged to the Reincarnation Hall, and only Black and White Yama had the authority to command them.

Two soldiers stood upright, their eyes cold. Even though Luo Tian's strength surpassed theirs, the soldiers' gazes remained unshaken.

"Comparable to Bu Tian City's strength!" Luo Tian scanned the vast city with his spiritual sense. Even with his spiritual awareness, he hadn't fully surveyed the entire garrison city.

Though he didn't see everything, he caught a general idea. He knew the Gate of Hell's garrison strength was roughly comparable to Bu Tian City, but considering the endless ghosts, if a real battle broke out, Bu Tian City wouldn't last half a month.

Ye Chen's eyes also held complex emotions. He naturally felt the Gate of Hell's strength, silently marveling at his years in Hell.

Previously, Ye Chen had thought Hell was weak, a place suppressed by the Immortal Realm. But over these years, he had realized if Hell truly attacked the Immortal Realm, eight out of ten chances it would conquer it.

"Who are you?" The two soldiers spoke loudly, their eyes wary as they gazed at the three.

"Reincarnation Hall's Holy Prince, Luo Chen, has arrived to join the army!" Luo Tian spoke with authority, waving his hand and sending a token to the two soldiers.

"Reincarnation Hall's Holy Prince?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the two soldiers' faces slightly straightened. Their eyes scanned Luo Tian carefully and examined the token of a Holy Prince.

"Respectful greetings, Holy Prince!" The two soldiers' eyes immediately showed respect. Though the Gate of Hell was far from the Reincarnation Hall, news spread swiftly—after all, if the Immortal Realm attacked, the Reincarnation Hall must know.

Thus, the name of Luo Tian's Holy Prince and his deeds were already known in the Gate of Hell. Especially since Luo Chen had helped the Reincarnation Hall win fifth place in the Ten Palaces' Grand Competition, earning them control over the Fire Hell.

In short, Luo Tian's reputation was high in the Gate of Hell—many had heard of him even if they hadn't seen his face.

"辛苦了!" Luo Tian smiled, surprised the two guards knew him.

"Holy Prince, please wait a moment—I'll inform them immediately!" One guard turned and entered the city gate.

Not long after, several figures emerged from the city gate. A cold feeling swept over the world—ten people in total, nine wearing black armor with different patterns, and one in a black robe. The most notable feature was the faceless man—despite years passing, seeing his face still made Luo Tian feel a chill and his scalp tingle.

Faceless had left deep shadows in the End of Days Forest, even with Luo Tian's increased strength and defeating the Heavenly Demon King. Seeing Faceless still stirred an instinctive fear.

Faceless, the commander of the Gate of Hell, and behind him stood Du Tianming with a tiger pattern on his armor.

"Unknown Holy Prince, what business do you have here?" A raspy voice came from Faceless's face, making Luo Tian uncomfortable.

"Ordered by the Hall Master, I've come to the Gate of Hell to fight!" Luo Tian quickly explained his purpose.

"Good! If you have the will, then enter the city!" Faceless's faceless gaze met Luo Tian. He felt a strange familiarity.

Faceless handed Luo Tian over to Du Tianming, knowing he was a disciple of Du Jianxing and that Luo Shui had close ties with Du Tianming. It was best to leave him under Du Jianxing's care—Holy Prince was a hot potato, and he didn't want to take responsibility if anything went wrong.

"Yes!" Du Tianming immediately accepted the order, gazing at Luo Tian and Ye Chen. Upon emerging, he saw Luo Shui but was puzzled—yet Du Tianming only questioned silently, as Faceless was present.

"First, a welcome feast! Afterward, you'll be assigned to the Tiger Army!" Faceless turned and led Luo Tian and others into the military camp.

Disciplined military camps surprised Luo Tian, who had stayed in Bu Tian City before. Though Bu Tian City's garrison seemed lazy, it was orderly. Hell's garrison was no less than Bu Tian City's. Luo Tian had expected chaos but found none.

They entered a grand hall, and after finishing the feast with Faceless and others, Luo Tian was led by Du Tianming to the Tiger Army.

"Brother, what's going on? Why are you here?" Du Tianming asked Luo Shui and Luo Tian directly. Ye Chen was ignored.

"Big brother, I won't hide it..." Luo Shui's eyes showed sorrow as he recounted the events to Du Tianming.

Upon hearing Luo Shui's words, Du Tianming's face darkened, his eyes flashing with murderous intent. He hadn't expected Luo Shui to almost die.

"Listen to your brother—don't seek revenge yet. Wait until you're strong enough!" Du Tianming sighed, knowing the Heavenly Demon King's identity was sensitive. Not everyone could provoke him.

"Right. That's why I came to seek your help!"

"Only here can the Heavenly Demon King's reach not extend. Only here can I quickly enhance my strength!" Luo Shui spoke softly.

"Right. But I'm surprised this kid managed to become a Holy Prince. Should I call you little brother or nephew?" Du Tianming smiled, looking at Luo Tian.

"Uh..." Upon hearing Du Tianming's words, the group felt slightly awkward. Since Luo Tian was a disciple of Du Jianxing, he was his peer.

"Uncle, let's not get into this!" Luo Tian sighed, surprised Du Tianming would argue over such a trivial matter.

"Why did you come here? A Holy Prince should be focusing on his duties, not knowing the danger here!" Du Tianming spoke softly, his eyes filled with admiration. Years of battlefield experience made him sensitive to danger—he could sense Luo Tian's immense strength.

"The Reincarnation Hall is too boring!" Luo Tian replied, leaving Du Tianming speechless.

"Alright, rest well. Since you've come here, no one will touch you!" Du Tianming arranged for Luo Tian and Ye Chen to rest. He warned them not to wander off before leaving.

"When are you leaving?" As soon as Du Tianming left, Luo Shui asked Luo Tian, his eyes showing a hint of sorrow. He had already guessed Luo Tian's identity.

"Tonight!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, worried about Zhang Ziping. It had been years since he last checked in—he didn't know what was happening there and wanted to return.

"Okay, if there's a chance in the future, come back here!" Luo Shui sighed softly, his figure seeming older.

That night, Luo Tian left all the treasures he had looted from the Heavenly Demon King to Luo Shui. He wanted Luo Shui to use them to break through to the half-step Immortal King level.

After arranging everything, Luo Tian and Ye Chen flew onto Bu Tian Shi at night, becoming a speck of dust drifting out of the Gate of Hell into the vast battlefield between the Gate of Hell and Bu Tian City.

Time passed, drifting for half an hour. Luo Tian and Ye Chen arrived at the battlefield. It wasn't a time of war, but many soldiers from the Gate of Hell and ghosts chose to enter the battlefield to fight with Bu Tian City's cultivators, gaining merits. Luo Tian and Ye Chen moved like ordinary soldiers toward Bu Tian City.

Black earth stretched beneath them, Ye Chen's face filled with excitement—once they crossed this battlefield, it would be Bu Tian City. He could return to Star River Mansion.

Yet Ye Chen was puzzled why Luo Tian had sneaked out secretly. After all, Luo Tian's identity was too special. The battlefield was ever-changing, and he wasn't with the main force—should anything happen to Luo Tian, it would be a great loss for the Reincarnation Hall.

But Ye Chen didn't ask further, and they flew swiftly toward Bu Tian City under the black night. The soldiers and ghosts emerging from the Gate of Hell were surprised but, upon sensing their cultivation levels, didn't question them.

The battlefield was vast, and as Luo Tian and Ye Chen delved deeper, they encountered battles between Bu Tian City's cultivators and the Gate of Hell.

"Two True Immortals at the end—kill them! This is a lot of merits!" As Luo Tian and Ye Chen walked, they finally encountered Bu Tian City's cultivators. Their ghostly aura was strong, naturally drawing the hunters' attention.

Chapter 2204: The Embarrassed Ghost Eight Guards
