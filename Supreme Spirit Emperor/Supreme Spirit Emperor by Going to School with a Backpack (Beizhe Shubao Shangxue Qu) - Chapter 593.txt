The grudge of avenging my father's death must be fulfilled, but I also owe Ye Wudao for his nurturing. These years, those elders have only exploited him, using him to gather intelligence on Ye Wudao!

Ye Chen's plan was to dismantle these elders' first layer of schemes. He would never confront Ye Wudao and Ye Liangchen, even if it meant death.

Ye Chen kept speaking, recounting his years of hardship to Ye Liangchen, his eyes filled with regret. Over these years, due to his intelligence, Ye Liangchen had faced danger multiple times, and Ye Wudao too had experienced near-death situations.

"Older Brother, you're foolish!"

"When Uncle Ye Cheng passed away, Father has always felt deep remorse. I've heard Father speak of it—his death was not what you think!" Upon hearing Ye Chen's words, Ye Liangchen instantly understood, his gaze turning to Ye Chen.

"Uncle Ye Cheng was my father's close friend. During an expedition, Uncle Ye Cheng sacrificed himself to save my father, taking a fatal strike meant for him!"

"After my father returned to Star River Sect, he sought after you and your mother, only to find you two had vanished without a trace!"

"Later, my father discovered who had assassinated him—this was none other than a faction of Star River Sect's elders. Though my father eradicated that entire clan, he also felt guilty for Uncle Ye Cheng's death being tied to him." Ye Liangchen spoke, causing Ye Chen's body to tremble slightly.

"You... what do you mean?" Ye Chen's eyes widened in disbelief, staring at Ye Liangchen as if struck by lightning.

"How could it be..." Ye Chen refused to believe it, realizing that the person he had hated for years was actually his father's brother.

Over these years, he had subtly probed Ye Wudao, and each time hearing Ye Wudao speak of Uncle Ye Cheng, he saw Ye Wudao's guilt. Thus, he had assumed Ye Wudao was responsible for Uncle Ye Cheng's death.

"Father named you Ye Chen because you looked remarkably like Uncle Ye Cheng, hence the name's homophonic resemblance..." Ye Liangchen spoke, his voice tinged with emotion. He knew Ye Chen needed time to accept this truth.

"Ah..." Ye Chen cried out repeatedly, his voice agonized, and those around him heard the hatred and regret in it.

"I am sorry for everything!" Ye Chen collapsed to the ground, his voice heavy with guilt as he gazed at Ye Liangchen. Reflecting on his years of actions, a death wish arose within him.

"Don't act so sentimental—do you not know what time it is?" Just as Ye Chen's resolve to die surfaced, Luotian's roar shook him.

"Brother, rest well!" Ye Chen spoke softly before leaping into the air, rushing toward the elder surrounded by the Yama Eight Guards.

"Scum!" The elder's face shifted as Ye Chen approached, cursing him. In response, Ye Liangchen's icy sword clashed with the elder, its blade like a dragon roaring toward him. Meanwhile, Luotian danced through combat with Ye Xiao, his black sword leaving Ye Xiao battered and retreating.

"How strong!" Ye Xiao marveled inwardly, watching Luotian's relentless assault. Their previous exchanges had left him barely fending off each strike, with no chance to retaliate.

Chapter 2248: I Shall Take Control

Ye Xiao spat blood under Luotian's relentless attacks, his body bearing multiple wounds. Had he not reacted swiftly, the injuries would have been far worse. Though others were not as formidable as Luotian, they matched evenly, and the Blood Star Guards fought valiantly, killing rebellious disciples.

Blood stained the Stellar Platform, and observers marveled, grateful for their neutrality. Meanwhile, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian clashed with Ye Tao, their combined strength matching Ye Tao's.

"Wham!" Luotian's strike sent Ye Xiao spitting blood again, his staff riddled with cracks.

"I can't lose—should I fall, this brat will finish the rest in no time!" Ye Xiao roared internally but felt powerless against Luotian. Not only was Ye Xiao unwilling to surrender, but other elders also refused to accept defeat. Their long-planned scheme had overlooked Luotian's group, underestimating their strength. Without them, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian could not have lasted.

Yet no one anticipated Luotian's group being so formidable, capable of clashing with seven True Immortal Peak elders. And Luotian himself was a monster, leaving even True Immortal Peak elders helpless.

They had also targeted Luotian, as four sects had besieged Shenglong Sect. But perhaps due to shame, they hadn't informed Ye Xiao.

"Terrifying—these people have turned the tide!" Observers murmured, watching Luotian's relentless pressure on Ye Xiao.

"Yes, the key to this battle lies in these seven True Immortal Peak elders and Luotian's group," one elder sighed. After years of growth, Luotian's group had become formidable.

"I'll fight to the death!" Ye Xiao roared, blood staining his staff as he carved crimson runes into it. The staff radiated immense power.

"Boom!" In an instant, the blood-stained staff surged forward, crushing Luotian. Yet Luotian's eyes flickered with seriousness as he gripped Longyuan Sword and met the staff.

"Crash!" The blood-stained staff shattered, its explosion sending dust and smoke swirling. Amid the chaos, Ye Xiao's pale face showed his breathlessness as he gazed at Luotian. His eyes widened in disbelief.

"Not even harmed!" Ye Xiao trembled, recalling that strike had drained nearly eighty percent of his strength.

"Ha... ha..." Luotian coughed up blood, leaning on Longyuan Sword as he gazed at Ye Xiao with disdain. His feet moved swiftly, creating whirlpools as he activated Huangquan Step to vanish from sight.

In a flash, Luotian appeared beside Ye Xiao, his black sword slicing downward.

"Open!" Ye Xiao bellowed, raising his blood-stained staff to meet Longyuan. Now he only sought to delay, hoping others would win.

"Crack!" A thunderous sound echoed as the staff and sword clashed, leaving Ye Xiao's body flying backward into the swirling dust.

"Luotian wins!" The crowd gasped, watching Ye Xiao's pitiful form. Luotian emerged from the dust, his body wreathed in black mist.

Though he walked slowly, his speed was lightning-fast. In three steps, he stood before Ye Xiao, Longyuan Sword descending again.

"One... two..." Ye Xiao's arms ached, but he gritted his teeth, holding the staff above his head to clash with Longyuan.

"Seven!" Luotian delivered seven strikes, and Ye Xiao's staff finally shattered.

"Spit..." The black sword sliced Ye Xiao's shoulder, nearly cleaving him in two. Yet Luotian controlled his strength—this was an internal conflict, and Ye Wudao would decide whether to kill him.

Luotian estimated Ye Wudao's nature: Ye Xiao would not survive, for he had attacked Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen. Such a man's character was flawed.

Luotian infused runes into Ye Xiao, immobilizing him before kicking him toward Ye Liangchen.

"Brother, watch over him—I'll take the next!" Luotian laughed, shouldering his sword as he rushed toward an elder clashing with Wan Lingkong.

At that moment, Wan Lingkong was in dire straits. Though he was a True Immortal Late Stage, his opponent was a True Immortal Peak. Wan Lingkong's strength was formidable but his specialty lay in formations, leaving him at a disadvantage.

"You're late—almost killed!" Wan Lingkong sighed, retreating to let Luotian take over.

"Give me a quarter of an hour to settle this!" Luotian smiled, striking the elder and forcing him back.

"Luotian!" The elder's face darkened, watching Ye Xiao lying beside Ye Liangchen. Though stronger than Ye Xiao, he lacked confidence in defeating him so swiftly.

"Got it!" Wan Lingkong laughed, moving to the platform's edge. His eyes flashed gold as he swiftly deployed array flags.

After years of refinement, Wan Lingkong's formation mastery had reached its peak—his ultimate weapon. Previously, Luotian had set up the Ten Thousand Gods' Punishment Array in Zhongshan City. Nan Gong Yuqing had encountered it while aiding, and Wan Lingkong had cracked it despite the array's initial impenetrability.

Yet recently, Wan Lingkong had mastered it—showing his terrifying formation skills, though only with ample time.

Eighty-one golden array flags rose, instantly surrounding the Stellar Platform with radiant gold light.

"Wow, impressive!" Luotian marveled at the flowing array flags, recalling how Wan Lingkong's formations had been effective.

"Boom!" Luotian punched the elder, sending him flying. He ignored Wan Lingkong now, focusing solely on the elder.

The battle briefly balanced but, as time passed, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian began to falter.

"Damn it..." Ye Wudao's anger surged as his star blade slashed through space, only to be deflected by Ye Tao. Golden dragons coiled around Ye Tao's body like golden waves.

"Stellar Seal!" Ye Tian roared, his hands forming a seal as a green seal descended to crush Ye Tao.

"Roar!" Golden dragons rose, colliding with the green seal.

"Boom!" The golden dragons shattered into a torrential cascade, returning to Ye Tao's side. More dragons lashed toward Ye Wudao and Ye Tian, forcing them to scramble. Without Runchen Yu, Shiluo, and Tian Luo's help, they would have already lost.

Runchen Yu, Shiluo, and Tian Luo hid in the shadows, seeking opportunities but Ye Tao seemed to predict their positions. Meanwhile, Luotian repeatedly attacked the elder, aiming to assist Ye Wudao.

Yet this elder was remarkably tenacious and seemed skilled in body cultivation. Though Luotian's attacks wounded him, he wasn't crushed like Ye Xiao.

Time passed slowly until Wan Lingkong opened his eyes, gazing at the battlefield with fierce confidence.

"Now, I shall control the battlefield!" Wan Lingkong spoke softly, holding a golden array flag radiating gold light.

At the same time, the eighty-one flags surrounding the Stellar Platform emitted terrifying fluctuations. Golden whirlwinds spread from each flag, absorbing celestial energy from the surroundings.

The heavens trembled as仙气 (divine energy) within a hundred miles of Star River Sect surged toward the Stellar Platform, forming a golden vortex. Thunder interwove within it, radiating terrifying pressure.

"What is that?" Star River Sect disciples gasped, watching the massive vortex in the sky.

"Uncle Ye, recover!" Wan Lingkong waved his golden flag, his robes fluttering as he pointed. Waves of energy radiated from his hand, enveloping Ye Wudao.

"Whirr..." A golden array flag floated, its whirlwind compressing and merging into Ye Wudao's body.

Chapter 2249: The幕后 (Behind the Scenes)

The golden whirlwind merged into Ye Wudao's body, and a thunderous roar echoed within him. It felt like violent waves crashing, and Ye Wudao's aura erupted.

"Boom!" Finally, under Ye Wudao's shock, something cracked within him, and a terrifying aura surged from his body.

"Half-Step Immortal King!"

"How is this possible!" Ye Tao's face twisted in horror, watching Ye Wudao's overwhelming aura.

"This..." Ye Wudao's eyes also showed disbelief. He could sense his poison hadn't been cured but had instead been enhanced through a secret technique, lifting him to Half-Step Immortal King without side effects.

"Uncle Ye Tian, recover!" Wan Lingkong ignored Ye Wudao's shock and pointed his flag at Ye Tian. The same thunderous roar echoed, and Ye Tian also returned to Half-Step Immortal King strength.

"Amazing! It can elevate one's realm!" The crowd marveled, gazing at Wan Lingkong holding the golden flag.

"Sealing Array! Wan Lingkong has mastered it!" Nan Gong Yuqing and others showed joy.

"Sealing Array?" Luotian was equally astonished, watching Ye Wudao and Ye Tian's overwhelming auras.

"If you have no more tricks, it's over!" Ye Wudao leaped into action, slicing with his blade. The cosmos trembled as a green blade slashed toward Ye Tao.

"Damn it!" Ye Tao's face darkened, summoning golden dragons to block the green blade. Yet this time was different—golden dragons were shattered by Ye Wudao's strike.

"Boom!" The blade struck Ye Tao, spitting blood as he was thrown back. Ye Tian had already positioned behind Ye Tao, delivering a kick that shattered dozens of golden dragons and struck Ye Tao's body, sending him back to Ye Wudao.

The battle turned instantly—Ye Wudao and Ye Tian alone were enough to overwhelm Ye Tao. With both联手 (teamwork), Ye Tao had no chance, bouncing between them like a ball.

"Boost everyone's strength!" Wan Lingkong smiled, his hands moving as golden whirlwinds from the flags flew into Luotian and Nan Gong Yuqing's bodies.

In an instant, their strength surged. Luotian's eyes widened in shock, feeling the power of True Immortal Peak as he gazed at his opponent.

One glance sent the elder into a panic—when Luotian was in True Immortal Late Stage, he had already been beaten. If time extended, he would have met Ye Xiao's fate. Now, with Luotian in True Immortal Peak, he had no chance.

As the elder was stunned, Luotian moved like a ghost, appearing before him without drawing his fist or sword. He collided directly with the elder's body.

"Crack!" A sharp sound echoed from the elder, who was sent flying and fell to the ground.

One collision left the elder severely wounded. Luotian pointed, infusing divine patterns onto him to seal his power.

With the elder subdued, others also began overwhelming their opponents—after all, everyone's strength had increased.

Time passed; half an hour elapsed. One by one, elders fell to the ground. Luotian and others stood there.

"Boom!" A streak of light fell from the sky, crashing into the ground—Ye Tao landed in view.

"Cease!" Ye Wudao roared, addressing the rebellious disciples still clashing with Blood Star Guards.

"Are you still不服 (not submitting)? Do you have more tricks? If not, what should we do now?" Ye Wudao's eyes held mockery as he gazed at the elders.

"This array is too absurd—it elevates one's realm effortlessly. How can we fight?" Star River Sect disciples murmured.

"Regrettable, they planned for years but were destroyed by Luotian's group. Without them, perhaps success would have been possible," elders sighed, yet庆幸 (rejoiced) in their choice.

"Ye Wudao, do you think this is over?" One elder spoke weakly, his teeth broken by Chen Zhanbiao's punch.

"Is there another move?" Ye Wudao furrowed his brow, gazing at the elders with a bad feeling.

"Ultimately, I must emerge!" As Ye Wudao pondered, a long sigh echoed in everyone's ears, causing their hearts to tighten.

A pressure descended—above them stood an elder, his aura exuding a divine presence. His robes fluttered as he gazed at Ye Wudao and others.

"Now, it is over. Ye Wudao, you didn't expect me to have ascended to Immortal King, did you?" The elder spoke softly. His words echoed, and a domain of blue light enveloped everyone.

"Crush..." The elder spoke softly, and the eighty-one array flags surrounding the Stellar Platform shattered into golden light, vanishing from sight.

As the flags disintegrated, Luotian's group's aura plummeted back to their original strength. Their faces darkened as they gazed at the elder above.

"Damn it, no one mentioned an Immortal King! How can we fight!" Diao Dezhu cursed, his voice filled with helplessness.

They could have defeated Half-Step Immortal Kings together, but against a true Immortal King, they were powerless. With the domain activated, even if they outnumbered him, they would be crushed.

"No fight left!"

"Get closer to me!" Luotian ordered, his voice grave. He prepared to activate the Supreme Stone.

Ye Wudao and others might survive, but they were different—they had disrupted most of the elders' plans. The elders, seeking revenge, might kill them.

"Ye Heng!" Ye Wudao's face darkened as he gazed at the elder. The elder was his uncle by seniority.

"Where is Ye Sheng?" Ye Heng spoke again, his voice calm. He hadn't appeared before due to fear of Ye Sheng. Originally, he intended for Ye Tao and others to pressure Ye Wudao and Ye Tian, testing whether Ye Sheng was weakened.

No matter how fierce Ye Wudao's battle, it ultimately relied on Ye Sheng. If Ye Sheng wasn't weakened, they would win.

Ye Heng had observed secretly, controlling Ye Tao and Ye Xiao's actions.

But he hadn't anticipated Ye Tao and others being so incompetent—Ye Sheng wasn't forced out, but instead was defeated by Ye Wudao.

"This is their greatest reliance!" Ye Wudao thought, surprised the elders had an Immortal King. An Immortal King could suppress all.

"Ye Wudao, you didn't expect Ye Heng to become an Immortal King, did you? What use is your strength?" Ye Xiao and others roared, gazing at Ye Wudao and Ye Tian's grim faces.

"Finished! Without Ye Sheng, no one can match Ye Heng!" Elders' faces showed disbelief. They hadn't expected Ye Heng to ascend to Immortal King, a fact they had never heard of.

Ten elders fell pitifully but with joy—Ye Heng was their greatest reliance, their final ace. An Immortal King could shake Ye Wudao's faction.

"Ye Sheng, why haven't you emerged?" Ye Heng roared, his voice echoing through Star River Sect.

"It seems he's truly weakened. Then, end it!" Ye Heng smiled softly. This situation showed Ye Sheng's weakness—he hadn't emerged, proving his true weakness.

"What more do you have to say, Ye Wudao?" Ye Heng spoke softly, his gaze like a ruler as he looked at Ye Wudao.

Next was simple: impose restrictions on Ye Wudao, seize power, search for Ye Sheng, bind him, and wait until he recovered. Star River Sect would be under their control.

But when Ye Heng gazed at Ye Wudao, his body paused—Ye Wudao and Ye Tian wore smiles. Even Luotian's face held one.

"Uncle Ye Heng, I didn't expect you to be lured out!" As Ye Heng puzzled, a soft laugh echoed. A figure flew from Star River Sect's west and stood in the sky.

A determined face, sharp eyes, a green star robe, and a smile—gazing at this middle-aged man, all elders trembled, losing their former arrogance. They looked like mice before a cat, including Ye Heng.

This man was the first genius of Star River Sect in nearly ten thousand years, ascending to Immortal King in just three thousand years. His talent rivaled only the sect's first master.

As Ye Sheng arrived, Luotian's group felt their pressure from Ye Heng vanish.

"Ye... Ye Sheng!" Seeing this middle-aged man, Ye Heng's face darkened in disbelief.

"How could it be? You weren't weakened!" Ye Heng trembled, though he was an Immortal King. Yet Ye Sheng had left a shadow in the elders' hearts.

Have you seen a group of two or three thousand-year-olds being scolded by a three-hundred-year-old youth? They had, and Ye Sheng was the best example. At that time, Ye Sheng was undoubtedly Star River Sect's top figure.

Chapter 2250: The Victor

"Uncle Ye Heng, it's better for you to stay as Star River Sect's elder. You're old—enjoy your twilight years!" Ye Sheng stood there, smiling, his aura surpassing Ye Heng's.

"Ye Sheng, I am also an Immortal King. Why should I submit to you?" Ye Heng's face darkened, gazing at Ye Sheng who stood calmly.

"Seems we must fight!" Ye Sheng spoke softly, pointing a finger at Ye Heng.

Thunder echoed as his single finger caused the heavens to tremble. Ye Heng's face darkened, gazing at the approaching finger and striking with a fist.

In an instant, the finger met the fist, and Ye Heng's body was hurled backward, crashing into the ground.

"Crack!" The Stellar Platform exploded, dust swirling through the heavens. Luotian's group gazed in shock as they were engulfed by dust.

"Ah..." Ye Heng roared, leaping back but still in despair—despair at being so thoroughly defeated by Ye Sheng's single finger.

"Alas..." Ye Sheng sighed, then pointed again, sending Ye Heng crashing back down.

"Spit..." Luotian's group coughed as they emerged from the dust, gazing at Ye Sheng in the sky.

"Too strong! Even an Immortal King like Ye Heng couldn't fight back!" Diao Dezhu marveled, gazing at Ye Sheng's calm face.

"Because he is an Immortal King in the middle stage!" Luotian spoke softly, admiration in his eyes. This was the first time he had admired someone after arriving in the Immortal Realm.

Previously, he had met Ye Wudao twice, and Ye Wudao introduced him to Ye Sheng. Though Ye Sheng looked like a corpse, Luotian could sense his immense aura. Moreover, the Supreme Stone had said Ye Sheng wasn't recovering in a month but three days.

At that time, Luotian had realized this might be Ye Sheng's scheme—luring out Ye Heng and others. Perhaps even Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen were deceived, fearing leaks. Ye Wudao and Ye Tian might have known all along, hence their lack of fear—when their strength dropped, they only looked grim.

"Acted so convincingly!" Luotian sighed inwardly, gazing at Ye Wudao and Ye Tian. He admired Ye Sheng; without the Supreme Stone, he might have been deceived too.

"Ye Sheng, you've reached the middle stage of Immortal King!" Ye Heng slowly rose from the ground, his face filled with disbelief as he gazed at Ye Sheng.

"What?" Everyone's faces showed disbelief, including Ye Wudao and Ye Tian.

They knew Ye Sheng's weakness had shortened tenfold, requiring only three days to recover—but they hadn't expected Ye Sheng to reach the middle stage.

"Thus, he could crush an Immortal King in the early stage!" Elders marveled, then turned to joy.

"Haha! Star River Sect has finally produced an Immortal King in the middle stage!" Elders laughed, Ye Sheng's ascension would solidify Star River Sect's position. Even the Nine Immortal Mountains would hesitate before challenging it. In the entire Immortal Realm, including the Upper Three Heavens, an Immortal King in the middle stage was a top-tier figure.

Hells were strong, but on the surface, only eight Immortal Kings in the middle stage existed—尊崇 (revered) as Eight Heavenly Kings, guarding the Hell's Gate.

"Congratulations, Elder Ye Sheng, for reaching the middle stage of Immortal King!" Elders rushed forward to declare their allegiance.

"Conceded! I submit wholeheartedly!" Ye Heng sighed, though reluctant, he had no choice.

Moreover, Ye Heng was completely defeated—after years of scheming, he had lost to strength. Ye Sheng's brilliance was undeniable.

"One condition: no killing!"

"Another: have this brat killed!" Ye Heng spoke softly, gazing at Ye Sheng while pointing to Luotian. Though regardless of Luotian's presence, if Ye Sheng was safe, their plan would fail. Yet Ye Heng had grown to hate Luotian.

"Old fool!" Luotian cursed inwardly, gazing at Ye Sheng.

"Dangerous! Don't agree!" Ye Wudao roared, objecting to Ye Heng's condition. He hadn't expected Ye Heng to propose such a demand.

"Ye Sheng, if you agree, we elders and disciples will wholeheartedly submit to your restrictions, supporting your faction for generations!" Ye Heng spoke, gazing at Ye Sheng.

Ye Heng knew Ye Sheng would choose—on one side, an Immortal King and a Half-Step Immortal King with numerous True Immortal Peak elders; on the other, a genius. Who was more valuable? Ye Sheng knew.

"Old dog, you're too shameless!" Diao Dezhu cursed, Nan Gong Yuqing and others tensed, their eyes flashing with killing intent. Luotian's face darkened as he glanced at Ye Heng, then turned to Ye Sheng.

"He's hesitating!" Luotian instantly noticed Ye Sheng's hesitation, his heart cold but he said nothing.

Others didn't know, but Ye Sheng's ascension to the middle stage of Immortal King had a connection with Luotian. Yet Luotian hadn't spoken about it.

Ye Sheng's gaze was profound, unreadable. Finally, he smiled: "People must be killed, but not Luotian—him!"

Ye Sheng pointed a finger, and Ye Xiao's body exploded into blood mist, scattering in view. The elders' hearts trembled slightly.

"Defeat must be accepted—why discuss terms?" Ye Sheng's face was icy, gazing at Ye Heng.

"Luotian has done us a favor; I cannot be ungrateful!"

"Is an Immortal King in the early stage worth Luotian's group?" Ye Sheng coldly asked, his voice sharp.

"You..." Ye Heng's face darkened, surprised Ye Sheng refused this condition. His face showed bitterness.

"Luotian's group are all geniuses; killing one is trivial. But if Luotian were killed, Nan Gong Yuqing and others would definitely defect from Star River Sect. These people are key!"

"Such people, not only in their growth but also now a significant force!" Elders immediately understood, gazing at Luotian.

Luotian's heart eased slightly, understanding Ye Sheng's thoughts. Yet he felt uneasy—this showed some things weren't as he thought. If today he were here, Ye Sheng might have killed him to let Ye Heng's group submit willingly. Though it would cause resentment among Ye Wudao, Ye Tian, and Ye Liangchen, they were blood relatives.

"Enough—this matter ends here!" Ye Sheng spoke coldly, his hands moving as star patterns flew from them, entering Ye Heng's body.

Ye Heng and others wore bitter smiles—this was the cost of defeat. From now on, they could no longer harbor ill intent toward Ye Sheng or Ye Wudao. If they did, the restrictions would unleash terrible backlash.

"Take an oath of blood!" Ye Wudao spoke again, knowing some restrictions could be bypassed by special means, but blood oaths couldn't.

"Yes!" Elders sighed bitterly, taking the oath. If they didn't, Ye Sheng would certainly kill them.

Ye Sheng's face showed satisfaction before he leaped into the sky, vanishing from sight.

"Son, you've suffered!" Ye Wudao sighed longingly, knowing Luotian might have reservations.

"It's fine, Uncle Ye Heng also considered the bigger picture!" Luotian spoke softly, not wanting to stay in Star River Sect. He had plans of his own.

"Alright, everyone return and rest!" Ye Wudao called out. This crisis against their faction was finally resolved, aside from some deaths, it was acceptable.

"Go..." Luotian called to Nan Gong Yuqing and others, heading toward his residence. Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen also returned to their quarters, recovering from injuries.

This event was discussed among Star River Sect disciples, the happiest being Ye Sheng's ascension to Immortal King in the middle stage. This greatly benefited Star River Sect and the Supreme Stone faction. Luotian's group had fully revealed their strength, leaving others in awe. Without them, Ye Sheng wouldn't have emerged to capture Ye Tao and Ye Heng.

Time passed; they rested for seven days. During this time, Luotian's group did nothing but eat and drink.

Luotian finally relaxed, having never rested since arriving in Supreme City. Chen Zhanbiao had left with Meng Xue to find Lu Chong, while Nan Gong Yuqing and others planned to depart. Luotian hadn't wanted to go with them but intended to visit the Upper Three Heavens first.

As Luotian just saw off Nan Gong Yuqing, Ye Wudao transmitted a message for him to come.

Luotian's brow furrowed—over the past seven days, Ye Wudao hadn't contacted him. He guessed it was because Ye Wudao felt awkward.

Walking along the road, Star River Sect disciples showed respect for Luotian, having learned his strength from that battle.

Soon, Luotian reached the palace's entrance but felt a heavy presence within it, making him uneasy.

Chapter 2251: Re-entering Huan Tian City
