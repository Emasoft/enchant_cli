"Master, please hurry! I'm in a rush. My master is waiting for me to return for dinner!" Luo Tian weakly shouted towards the towering man in the sky.

"Dammit!" The surrounding people laughed at Luo Tian's words, even the elder ancestors found themselves stifling laughter.

"Stupid brat!" Si Tu Chen muttered, then ordered the Grand Master of the Tian Dao Sect to elevate the Thunder Punishment one level.

"Ninth!" With Si Tu Chen's words, the Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect no longer hesitated. After all, even if he died, with the strength of Dan Zong and the elder ancestors, they could easily revive him in such a short time.

Thinking of this, the Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect moved his fingers slightly. The thunderstorm descended again, rushing toward Luo Tian with power two levels stronger than beforeâ€”second only to the Heavenly Punishment.

"Boom..." Luo Tian still had no defense, allowing the thunderstorm to carve through every cell of his body. In an instant, he collapsed onto the ground again.

Seeing Luo Tian's condition, everyone was shocked. His life force was gradually fading, showing signs of being unable to endure.

"Master! Save me!" Ren Hongzhi and others shouted toward Dan Zong, but Si Tu Chen remained indifferent.

Time slowly passed. Luo Tian seemed truly dead, lying on the ground with only a faint life force left, causing people to panic.

A moment was brief for cultivators, but in this case, it felt endlessly long.

After a moment, Luo Tian's body suddenly surged with green vitality, and his life force gradually rose. It seemed like spring bamboo after rain, rising rapidly.

"Only one more! Master, please don't hold back!" Luo Tian slowly stood up, his body still crackling with lightning. He gazed at the Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect in the sky.

Chapter 602: Get Out

Chapter 602: Get Out

"This is too provocative!" People heard Luo Tian's words and looked at him with disbelief.

Luo Tian felt bitter inside. He could only act this way; if he didn't show provocation, the Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect would surely hold back. The power of the thunder punishment would decrease, and it wouldn't achieve his goal of refining his body.

"Tenth!" Feeling the provocation in Luo Tian's eyes, the Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect finally showed anger. He coldly spoke.

"Boom..." A golden lightning bolt, as thick as a water bucket, descended from the sky with overwhelming power. People felt tremors in their hearts.

"This lightning's strength is almost comparable to the Heavenly Punishment!" Onlookers looked at the golden dragon of lightning descending from the sky, their faces filled with admiration.

"Approximately. Such intensity of thunder punishment would refine his body and allow him to barely enter the Sacrificial Soul realm," Luo Tian thought happily, gazing at the dragon of lightning with no fear. Instead, his eyes burned with fervor, as if looking at a rare treasure.

"Has he gone mad?" Some elder disciples looked puzzled.

"This figure is so familiar. This scene feels familiar!" Zheng Junfeng stood among the crowd, his face filled with contemplation. Luo Tian's current situation reminded him of something he had seen before, as if a proud man existed in his memories. But for now, he couldn't recall.

"Boom..." The golden dragon of lightning struck Luo Tian's body. It continuously refined his flesh and blood, making it stronger. However, it also made Luo Tian spit blood again, collapsing onto the ground. Compared to before, he was slightly better off; at least his life force hadn't been lost, but his flesh and meridians continuously emitted a burning scent under the thunder punishment.

Three seconds passed in an instant. Luo Tian was bathed in lightning, his eyes tightly closed. His entire body was wrapped in black, with traces of lightning remaining within him.

"One moment... two moments..." After half an hour, Luo Tian remained motionless with his eyes closed. Yet, he now felt like a chrysalis waiting to emerge.

"Crack..." Finally, under everyone's expectant gaze, the black body emitted a series of cracks. Fissures appeared on its surface.

"Crack..." Fragments fell to the ground, revealing a lustrous jade-like skin.

"Refining the body with thunder punishment. This kid really came up with something!" Some elder ancestors looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

"What a genius or fool this kid is!" Another elder ancestor sighed.

Other elders nodded in agreement, secretly lamenting that Luo Tian was foolish. To enhance his body, with Si Tu Chen's methods, if Zhang Daotian spent just a little time, Si Tu Chen could refine his body into the Sacrificial Soul realm in an instant.

"Has this kid truly changed?" Si Tu Chen, a powerhouse at the Soul Consolidation peak, just one step away from the Heavenly Sovereign realm, was astonished. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief.

"Roar..." Luo Tian roared upward. An invisible wave emanated from his body, causing people around him to feel fear.

"This isn't breaking out of the cocoon; it's becoming a dragon!" People inexplicably felt this way.

"Hmph..." The Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect coldly snorted, his gaze toward Zhang Daotian slightly changed before disappearing from view.

"Ah..." A series of screams echoed in Luo Tian's ears, bringing him back to consciousness. His face showed confusion.

But the next moment, his face turned pale as if he had realized something. A chill ran through his body. His eyes filled with terror, and a louder scream than before escaped his mouth. He tightly covered his private area.

The female disciples of the Seal Scripture Sect turned their heads, faces flushed red, and fled toward their quarters.

"Ha! Brother, you're good. Your assets are quite substantial!" Ren Hongzhi and others smiled as they approached Luo Tian, examining his naked body.

"Get out..." Luo Tian cursed, instinctively taking a robe from his storage ring and putting it on.

Then, Luo Tian's mind stirred. A look of joy appeared in his eyes.

"Storage ring! It actually works!" Luo Tian thought, surprised. He hadn't expected his storage ring to function in this mysterious world.

Initially, he thought this world was an illusion designed for people to find opportunities. Upon entering, he instinctively assumed the storage ring wouldn't work. But now, he was confused about what this Xian Gu site truly was.

"Buzz..." Before Luo Tian could think further, the displacement force appeared beneath his feet. In an instant, he found himself in Si Tu Chen's cave.

Si Tu Chen looked at Luo Tian with authority. This made Luo Tian's heart drum with fear.

"Have you realized your mistake?" Si Tu Chen asked, his face now gentle.

Luo Tian nodded nervously.

"Have you realized where you went wrong? Killing isn't the issue. For cultivators, killing is nothing. I've killed countless people in my life. Your mistake was not killing in private but doing it before many disciples. Even I couldn't openly protect you. If you had killed in secret, today you wouldn't have suffered this!" Si Tu Chen began to lecture Luo Tian. He felt that Zhang Daotian now could listen to his words.

"I should have told you, Master. I don't need to act. Just one word from you and he would vanish. No one would dare trouble you! Ultimately, it's a matter of strength. If I were a Heavenly Sovereign, even if I killed an inner disciple in front of all elders, no one would dare say a word!" Luo Tian's eyes sparkled with confidence as he spoke softly.

Hearing this, Si Tu Chen showed a hint of satisfaction and nodded slightly. "Understood. Today you truly surprised me, making me proud."

"Master, are you going to reward me?" Luo Tian smiled and asked Si Tu Chen. He mentally comforted himself, considering his master's status, a small gift was nothing.

"Speak up. What do you want?" Si Tu Chen's mood was good, and he spoke generously.

"Master, give me a few ninth-grade elixirs. Any two heavenly-level treasures, techniques, or martial arts would do!" Luo Tian rubbed his hands, looking embarrassed.

"Get out. Do you think the Tian Dao Sect is your personal business?" Si Tu Chen kicked Luo Tian out of his cave.

Chapter 603: Visitors

Chapter 603: Visitors

Luo Tian was kicked out of the cave, his back hitting the ground. But he wore a look of dissatisfaction as he shouted toward the entrance: "Master, even eighth-grade elixirs would be fine!"

"Also, Master, I have another enemy to deal with. Please help me!" Luo Tian continued shouting into the cave, making the disciples of Dan Zong laugh. Only Zhang Daotian dared to speak like this to Grand Master Si Tu Chen in the Tian Dao Sect.

"Get out... Get out of my sight..." Si Tu Chen's furious voice echoed from the cave.

At the same time, Luo Tian felt displacement force beneath his feet. A voice echoed in his mind: "Tell me the name of that person!"

"Buzz..." Luo Tian fell to the ground in a daze, his head ringing.

"Wow..." Luo Tian surveyed his surroundings and took a deep breath.

"Master, your place is really good!" Luo Tian thought in admiration. His spiritual sense probed around and found over a dozen attendants, all of whom were Soul Consolidation level masters.

Luo Tian felt touched. This was the first time he had lived in such a luxurious place, even better than his time at the Five Elements Sect or the Yu Ling Sect. This made him a bit uncomfortable.

Sitting on the ground, Luo Tian held a jade bottle. This was the same one that fell to the ground with him. He knew it was an elixir given by Si Tu Chen.

Opening the bottle, Luo Tian's eyes immediately brightened. The rich herbal energy made his spiritual sense feel comfortable. He knew if he took this elixir, he could definitely reach the Sacrificial Soul medium level or even advanced. This was an eighth-grade elixir, and only Grand Master Si Tu Chen could refine it.

Luo Tian didn't rush to swallow it. He wasn't sure if something strange would happen in this strange world. However, when he tried to put the bottle into his storage ring, it wouldn't fit.

"Damn!" Luo Tian looked at the bottle in disbelief, his face showing bitterness. He finally understood this elixir was a showpieceâ€”beautiful but useless.

At that moment, Luo Tian felt like he had eaten something terrible. He had a rare elixir but couldn't use it, which made him almost go crazy.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed, his face showing dissatisfaction. He tried again and again, using every method he could think of. Even putting it in his mouth, but the elixir wouldn't obey him.

After a night of trying, Luo Tian had to give up. He placed the elixir under his bed since he couldn't carry it.

In the morning, sunlight entered the spacious room. Luo Tian stepped out of the cave after a night's work.

Along the way, under the eager gazes of Dan Zong disciples and elders, Luo Tian exited the Dan Zong. He began to transmit a message to his waist's identity jade token.

"Ha! Daotian, you really made a name for yourself yesterday. Our old man praised you!"

"Exactly! You truly brought us honor yesterday!" Eight figures emerged one after another, their faces filled with joy. Zheng Junfeng stood behind Luo Tian respectfully.

"Daotian, I heard that another inner disciple died last night. Was it you?" Ren Hongzhi approached Luo Tian with a sly look, slapping his shoulder.

Hearing Ren Hongzhi's words, Luo Tian slightly raised his eyebrows. He hadn't expected Grand Master Si Tu Chen to be so indulgent, solving the top twenty Southern Region prodigy in just one night.

"Don't say nonsense. I'm a righteous man. When have I done such sneaky things? You, I've always been open and honest!" Luo Tian pushed Ren Hongzhi away angrily.

"Stop pretending. Last time when you saw Yao Biyue bathing, only you noticed. We covered for you and got into trouble. How can you still talk about being open and honest!" Ren Hongzhi looked unimpressed.

"Right! Daotian, tell us what the girl's figure was like!" Others joined in, their faces showing a sly grin.

"Damn! I didn't know about this!" Hearing the others' suggestive glances, Luo Tian mentally cursed. He hadn't expected his master to appear so serious now. His youth must have been extremely reckless.

"Boom..." A heavy bell sound echoed, making the laughing Luo Tian and others look puzzled.

This bell sound only rang for major events. A single ring meant the disciples gathered, two rings meant a big event, and three rings indicated a life-or-death crisis for the sect.

"Let's go. Maybe it's something good!" Ren Hongzhi and others, although they could stay away, were naturally curious. They couldn't resist the urge to watch.

Ten people flew together, chatting and laughing as they arrived at the main square of Tian Dao Sect. Under the respectful gazes of the crowd, people naturally made a path for Luo Tian and others to pass through.

"Buzz..." A wave of spiritual energy spread. The Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect, with a gloomy face, stepped onto the platform. Seeing Luo Tian and others, especially Luo Tian, his expression darkened further.

Before the Grand Master of Tian Dao Sect could speak, nine elder ancestors also appeared in the sky. Their eyes carried a hint of authority as they sat in midair.

"What's going on? Why are all nine elder ancestors here? Is there a major event?" People felt more puzzled. Even Luo Tian and others were tense.

"Several little brats, come up here!" One elder's eyes glowed like the sun as he spoke to Luo Tian and others. This elder was the first elder ancestor of Tian Dao Sect, Mu Rongcheng.

They grimaced but dared not disobey. They reluctantly got up and flew to their elders' sides. When the elder ancestors saw Luo Tian, their eyes showed a coldness that made Luo Tian instinctively shrink. He guessed this event might be related to him, otherwise the elders wouldn't have such expressions.

"Ha! My old brothers, it's been a while!" A laugh echoed from the sky, resounding throughout Tian Dao Mountain.

As the laughter spread, the clear sky darkened. A spiritual hand tore open space, creating a hundred-foot-wide rift in the dimming sky.

Then twenty-something figures emerged from the space. The leader was an elder with a smile, addressing Mu Rongcheng and other elder ancestors.

Chapter 604: Show Off

Chapter 604: Show Off

"Shen Xiande, why did you come so urgently to my Tian Dao Sect?" Mu Rongcheng's face was cold as he looked at the twenty-something people. Other elder ancestors also glared.

Shen Xiande, an elder ancestor of the Darkness Sect on Xianggu Continent, was one of twelve sects. Tian Dao Sect and the Darkness Sect were top-tier sects among these twelve. However, they had long been on uneasy terms. Though not to the point of mutual destruction, there were frequent minor conflicts. Even Luo Tian and his group had often clashed with them.

Like before, Luo Tian had bet with Shen Xiande's prodigy Ma XiuJie and lost the Tian Dao Thunder Sword.

"Shen Xiande, today you came to return our Tian Dao Thunder Sword?" Mu Rongcheng's face was cold as he addressed Shen Xiande.

"This isn't up to me. My incompetent disciple won it, so the ownership belongs to XiuJie. Why don't you ask him? I'm sure my disciple will grant you this favor!" Shen Xiande smiled, addressing the nine elder ancestors.

"Boom..." Shen Xiande's words made Tian Dao Sect disciples angry. Asking an immature kid to return the sword was a slap in the face for Tian Dao Sect.

Luo Tian, standing behind Si Tu Chen, showed confusion. He looked at Shen Xiande's back and saw a young man with an arrogant face.

Luo Tian knew this young man was Ma XiuJie, the one who had tricked him into losing the Tian Dao Thunder Sword. He was a prodigy of Xianggu Continent.

Feeling everyone's gaze, the young man on Shen Xiande's back smiled and slowly took a long sword from his back.

A humming sound echoed. The sword unsheathed, and thunderous sounds filled people's ears. Everyone narrowed their eyes as the sword emitted dazzling light, even making the sun in the sky seem dim.

"Tian Dao Thunder Sword!" The disciples of Tian Dao Sect gasped as they saw Ma XiuJie's sword.

A heavenly-grade treasure, though Tian Dao Sect had some, the most precious was this Tian Dao Thunder Sword. It symbolized Tian Dao Sect. Now it was in another's hands, not only the disciples but even the nine elder ancestors and Si Tu Chen felt uneasy.

"Showing off! This old man is just showing off!" The elder ancestors of Tian Dao Sect saw Ma XiuJie's actions and the attitude of Darkness Sect, cursing inwardly.

"Zhang Daotian, you little brat!" Several elder ancestors glared at Luo Tian. But they noticed Zhang Daotian's eyes were fixed on a bronze token on Ma XiuJie's waist.

"Main Command of the Xianggu Dao Order!" Luo Tian's eyes were fixed on Ma XiuJie's token, his breath quickened.

Luo Tian hadn't expected to meet someone with the main command of Xianggu Dao Order in this situation.

"Shangguang Hongtu!" Luo Tian's eyes were fixed on Ma XiuJie. In Ma XiuJie's arrogant gaze, he saw the image of Shangguang Hongtu.

Thinking this, Luo Tian's lips slightly curled. Standing behind Si Tu Chen, he looked at the group in front, waiting for more details. He knew these people hadn't come here just to show off.

Si Tu Chen's eyebrows slightly furrowed. His eyes carried confusion as he glanced at Luo Tian. He could sense a strong killing intent from Zhang Daotian just now. This killing intent was definitely not something a spoiled disciple could have; it felt like the aura of someone who had killed countless people.

"Geniuses of Tian Dao Sect, we've come to give you a chance to reclaim the Tian Dao Thunder Sword. So don't be hostile!" Ma XiuJie smiled, sheathing his sword and addressing the disciples of Tian Dao Sect.

"Everyone, my bet still stands. If any disciple of Tian Dao Sect defeats me, I'll return the Tian Dao Thunder Sword to you. Of course, you must also put up a corresponding bet!" Ma XiuJie calmly explained his purpose.

"Damn it!" Several elder ancestors' faces turned dark. They hadn't expected Shen Xiande to come with this trick.

"Good! We accept it. Are you sure that if our young generation defeats you, you'll return the Tian Dao Thunder Sword?" Luo Tian smiled and stepped forward, speaking loudly.

"Zhang Daotian, come back! You've caused enough trouble!" Mu Rongcheng glared at Zhang Daotian as he confidently stepped out, his face turning red.

"Done!" People saw Zhang Daotian stepping out and sighed inwardly. This little master was sure to cause another mess.

"Hey?" Ma XiuJie's Shangguang Hongtu slightly frowned. He felt a strange familiarity with this spoiled Zhang Daotian.

"He's from the Tianyuan Continent!" Shangguang Hongtu immediately guessed that Zhang Daotian wasn't from this era.

Thinking of this, Shangguang Hongtu couldn't help but smirk. His advantage was immense. This person was a disciple of Dan Zong, obviously with high status. Now it was the perfect time to eliminate him.

"What will you bet?" Shangguang Hongtu smirked, looking down at Luo Tian with contempt. In his view, this person was clearly not awake. According to the description in memory, Zhang Daotian was spoiled and Shangguang Hongtu naturally looked down on him.

"My life! If you win, my life is yours!" Luo Tian spoke confidently.

"Ha... I accept your bet!" Luo Tian's condition perfectly matched Shangguang Hongtu's intention. He didn't hesitate and accepted.

"Binding Soul Seal!" But a cold voice made Shangguang Hongtu stunned. In an instant, a yellow seal transformed into a golden light and burned on Shangguang Hongtu's body.

"Guys, beat him!" Luo Tian shouted and appeared above Shangguang Hongtu. He kicked Shangguang Hongtu's face with his foot.

The other eight spoiled disciples, hearing Luo Tian's words, showed eagerness. They laughed and rushed toward Shangguang Hongtu. Nine people surrounded Shangguang Hongtu, kicking him repeatedly without using their hands.

"Binding Soul Seal!" Luo Tian and others' sudden attack surprised Shangguang Hongtu. He hadn't expected Zhang Daotian to act so quickly.

Chapter 605: Underhanded Tactics

Chapter 605: Underhanded Tactics

"Old Eight, this Binding Soul Seal was your handiwork, right?" Mu Rongcheng smiled, watching Luo Tian and others beating Shangguang Hongtu. He spoke softly.

"Si Tu, the only correct thing your son has done in these years is this today. Although it's a bit rough, it really feels satisfying!" Several elder ancestors smiled at Si Tu Chen.

"Stop!" Shen Xiande's face turned angry, his overwhelming pressure pressing toward Luo Tian and others.

But with Mu Rongcheng's group, it was impossible for Shen Xiande to succeed. They lightly coughed, and Shen Xiande's overwhelming aura disappeared.

"Hey, keep being arrogant. Do you still want to bet?"

"Kill him, bastard!"

"Come on, come on! Let's all kick this bastard to death. We'll cover for you, little master!" Luo Tian shouted at the disciples of Tian Dao Sect who were watching.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the disciples of Tian Dao Sect's eyes brightened. First, those two hundred or so who were close to Luo Tian and had deep backgrounds in Tian Dao Sect flew toward Luo Tian's group, joining them.

Two hundred people surrounded Shangguang Hongtu. With the Binding Soul Seal from the Seal Master, Shangguang Hongtu's cultivation was completely restricted. He couldn't even resist.

"Boom... crack..." The sound of bones breaking echoed continuously on Shangguang Hongtu's body.

"Stop!" The people from the Darkness Sect finally couldn't control themselves, their faces filled with anger.

"Mu Rongcheng, what are you doing? Why are you beating my Darkness Sect's disciple? If you don't explain, it's not over! Stop immediately!" Shen Xiande's face turned furious. However, due to his status, he couldn't act.

"Old man, your disciple said that if our Tian Dao Sect's young generation defeats him, he would return the Tian Dao Thunder Sword to us. He didn't say how many people. Our young generation has tens of thousands; it's already lenient not to come all," Luo Tian kicked Shangguang Hongtu into the crowd and spoke to Shen Xiande.

"Pu..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, the disciples of Tian Dao Sect laughed and looked at Luo Tian with admiration. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so shameless.

"Rebellious disciple, stop!" Si Tu Chen coldly shouted at Luo Tian. But his eyes showed approval.

The scene was so chaotic. As Shen Xiande's young people tried to rescue Shangguang Hongtu, other disciples of Tian Dao Sect wouldn't sit idly by. All the disciples of Tian Dao Sect seemed to have taken a love potion, rushing forward and quickly surrounding those who came to rescue Shangguang Hongtu. They beat them up.

"Ma XiuJie, come on! Let's have a fair fight!" Luo Tian shouted continuously and stepped forward to Si Tu Chen, his face showing respect.

"Master! I've stopped!" Luo Tian spoke. He looked like a well-behaved child.

"Cough... cough..." The nine elder ancestors saw Luo Tian's appearance and lightly coughed to hide their smiles.

"Shen Xiong, you should make Ma XiuJie admit defeat. If this continues, it'll cost lives!" Mu Rongcheng looked at Shen Xiande with admiration. His voice was firm.

But Mu Rongcheng's group secretly surrounded the three elder ancestors of Darkness Sect. If they stopped, these people would definitely block them.

Shen Xiande's face was dark. He looked at Luo Tian behind Si Tu Chen, gritting his teeth. But he couldn't do anything. He had come to Tian Dao Sect to show off and see if he could win more, but Luo Tian's underhanded tactics had defeated him. He had also suffered a big loss.

"We admit defeat!" Shen Xiande almost squeezed out the words "admit defeat" from his teeth.

"Haha! Shen Xiong truly is a righteous man. Your disciple is also a prodigy of this era, who has the strength to challenge our entire Tian Dao Sect. This boldness matches your old self!" Mu Rongcheng laughed heartily, his aura suddenly solidified. His authoritative voice echoed in the ears of all Tian Dao Sect disciples.

With the elder ancestors' instructions, others naturally didn't disobey. They all stopped their actions and returned to the ground, their faces showing reluctance.

"Ha! I kicked Ma XiuJie once. If it gets out, he should be famous!"

"One kick is nothing. I hit Ma XiuJie with a slap!"

"Damn, it's such a loss. I didn't even get to go yet, and it was over!" The disciples of Tian Dao Sect discussed on the ground. This made Shen Xiande's face even darker.

A top prodigy of Darkness Sect was beaten by a group of small fry. If this incident spread, Ma XiuJie's prestige on the Xianggu Continent would definitely plummet.

The crowd dispersed, revealing Ma XiuJie and the several dozen Darkness Sect prodigies who had been beaten. Seeing their pitiful appearance, even the nine elder ancestors of Tian Dao Sect smiled.

At this moment, Ma XiuJie and those Darkness Sect disciples were in a pitiful state. Their bodies were barely covered by rags, and they looked plump with bruises. They fell from the sky.

"Be careful, Ma XiuJie!" Luo Tian shouted and activated his Bound Heaven Step. He instantly appeared in front of Ma XiuJie, pulling the Tian Dao Thunder Sword from his back. He kicked Ma XiuJie onto the ground.

"Master!" Luo Tian instantly appeared in front of Si Tu Chen, respectfully handing over the Tian Dao Thunder Sword.

Seeing the Tian Dao Thunder Sword in Si Tu Chen's hands, the other eight elder ancestors of Tian Dao Sect showed joy. They looked at Zhang Daotian for the first time with favor.

"Ugh..." Ma XiuJie was healed by the three elder ancestors of Darkness Sect. He slightly opened his eyes, suddenly recalling what had happened. This made the proud Shangguang Hongtu's face almost bleed.

"Zhang... Dao... Tian..." Shangguang Hongtu's eyes turned bloodshot, staring at Luo Tian in front of Si Tu Chen. He spoke coldly.

"What's wrong, Ma XiuJie? Do you still want to have a fair fight with our Tian Dao Sect disciples?" Luo Tian stepped forward, his eyes filled with mockery as he looked at Shangguang Hongtu.

Shangguang Hongtu, after carefully examining Luo Tian, showed a look of shock. His eyes were wide open.

"Luo Tian!" Shangguang Hongtu felt waves of shock. He hadn't expected to see Luo Tian in this situation.

"Unknown, do you dare to continue the bet?" Shangguang Hongtu quickly regained his composure. His face showed a hint of coldness as he spoke.

Chapter 606: Provocation?

Chapter 606: Provocation?

As Shangguang Hongtu's words fell, the entire Tian Dao Sect square became silent again. The disciples of Tian Dao Sect looked at Shangguang Hongtu's face with mockery.

"Provocation?" Luo Tian thought coldly. He also marveled that Shangguang Hongtu had become smarter after dying once, but his arrogance remained unchanged.

"What do you want to bet?" Luo Tian's lips slightly curled. His face also showed a hint of mockery as he looked at Shangguang Hongtu.

They had been enemies since their time in the Tianyuan Continent. Now, in this Xianggu site, they were still enemies.

Hearing Luo Tian's calm voice, the disciples of Tian Dao Sect looked surprised. Then they sighed inwardly: "This spoiled brat's personality hasn't changed at all!"

"What do you want to bet?" Shangguang Hongtu was taken aback. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to ask such a question. In his mind, with their relationship, the other person would have immediately accepted.

"What do you want to bet?" Seeing Luo Tian not following the usual pattern, Shangguang Hongtu could only ask.

"I want the method to unlock the restrictions in their bodies!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed like lightning. His gaze carried a hint of killing intent as he looked at Shangguang Hongtu.

"Good. Then I want the Tian Dao Thunder Sword and the Xianggu Dao Command!" Shangguang Hongtu spoke, his gaze carrying mockery.

"Huh?" Luo Tian's eyebrows furrowed deeply. He didn't know what Shangguang Hongtu wanted with the Tian Dao Thunder Sword.

Things in this world clearly couldn't be put into a storage ring. The Tian Dao Thunder Sword, although it was a heavenly-grade treasure, was just a display and couldn't be taken away.

"Don't agree. Don't agree!" Several elder ancestors saw Luo Tian in deep thought and silently cried out.

After all, Luo Tian had indeed won back the Tian Dao Thunder Sword according to their agreement. If Luo Tian agreed, due to Si Tu Chen's favor, the elder ancestors couldn't stop him.

Moreover, the Tian Dao Thunder Sword was still in Si Tu Chen's hands. With Si Tu Chen's indulgence toward Zhang Daotian, he might even give the Tian Dao Thunder Sword away again.

"The Tian Dao Thunder Sword is impossible. I only have one eighth-grade elixir. You can bet or not!" Luo Tian looked at the elder ancestors' anxious gazes and smiled.

"Relieved..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, the elder ancestors' hearts relaxed. Si Tu Chen looked at Luo Tian with a flicker of emotion, unsure why he felt an inexplicable sense. Luo Tian's changes in these days made Si Tu Chen feel a bit uncomfortable.

"Bet! But first, it's one-on-one!" Shangguang Hongtu slightly pondered and showed a hint of ferocity. He looked at Luo Tian, feeling that Luo Tian was currently at the Soul Consolidation peak. Even if he couldn't kill Luo Tian now, he wanted to humiliate him.

"Good!" Luo Tian spoke softly. His voice was calm, as if he were talking about something trivial. His eyes revealed endless confidence. However, this gaze was arrogant to the eyes of Tian Dao Sect's elder ancestors and disciples.

"Wow... he actually agreed! Zhang Daotian is Zhang Daotian. Previously, he couldn't even beat one of Ma XiuJie's subordinates. Now he dares to accept such an uneven bet. It's really..." The disciples of Tian Dao Sect discussed, secretly admiring Luo Tian's courage.

They immediately started the battle. Soon, their surroundings became a vacuum. The elder ancestors didn't stop Zhang Daotian and Ma XiuJie's bet, as it was the young people's matters. However, when the elder ancestors saw that Si Tu Chen, who indulged Zhang Daotian, was calmly sitting there, they felt puzzled.

Si Tu Chen was not the most powerful among Tian Dao Sect's elder ancestors. But he was the most mysterious one. No one had seen his full power. Now, Si Tu Chen's calmness made the others unsure of where his confidence came from.
