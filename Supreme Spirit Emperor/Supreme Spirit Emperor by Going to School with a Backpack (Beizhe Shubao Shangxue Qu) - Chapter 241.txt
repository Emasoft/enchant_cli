“Rest assured, that boy won’t suffer any loss wherever he goes. We can go investigate the Demon Domain!” Wan Lingkong’s voice carried a hint of embarrassment.

“Enough, enough—stop bickering!” Luotian felt a headache from the two arguing. He gestured for them to initiate teleportation.

“Let’s go! First, head to the Flame Domain. If we directly teleport to the Divine and Demon Domain, it would be too far!” Wan Lingkong’s expression turned solemn as he softly spoke. Alongside Jiang Nanxuan, they simultaneously activated a formation banner. The surrounding banners had already been set up, awaiting Luotian’s emergence.

“Hum…” Teleportation energy surged forth. With Jiang Nanxuan’s assistance, the formation proved reliable. In an instant, the group materialized outside the gates of Tongtian Mountain.

“Wow, Jiangge, you’re truly amazing! With your presence, everything feels different!” Zheng Xin gazed at the towering walls of Tongtian Mountain, admiration lighting his face.

“Come on, that’s my credit!” Wan Lingkong couldn’t help but retort at Zheng Xin’s awe.

“This…” The elder’s weathered face bore a flicker of astonishment as he gazed at the eight characters etched upon Tongtian Mountain.

“Those characters left by Gu Tianshu? Indeed, a true master of the era. Just the aura of these eight characters alone left me awestruck! Regretfully, he was suppressed by the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, Grandmaster Gu might have ascended as the Epoch Lord in this era!” The elder shook his head gently.

“Luotian, should we descend and visit? See if Gu Lei is there?” Zheng Xin spoke up, clearly discontent with being ignored by his companions and eager to lure Gu Lei out.

“Never mind,” Luotian shook his head lightly. He paid three bows to the mountain wall before instructing Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan to reconfigure the teleportation array. After all, entering Tongtian Mountain could take an indeterminate amount of time.

“Ha! Zheng Xin, you’re still mouthy, getting beaten again!” As Luotian’s words faded, a streak of violet light shot upward from the base of Tongtian Mountain. Its voice thundered in their minds.

“Gu Lei!” Recognizing the deep, resonant tone, Luotian and his companions knew who it was.

“Ha! Gu Lei, I’ve missed you so much! Let me tell you…” Zheng Xin’s face lit with excitement as he rushed toward the violet voice, embracing the figure in a bear hug.

“Early Saint rank!” Luotian observed the overwhelming aura of the violet figure, a smile tugging at his lips. He hadn’t expected Gu Lei’s cultivation to have advanced so swiftly.

The group exchanged another round of lively conversation. With Gu Lei’s arrival, Zheng Xin had endless stories to share, recounting the events of the Four Sacred Star Domains in meticulous detail.

“Thunder Domain? If only I hadn’t been in seclusion, the Four Sacred Star Domains wouldn’t have suffered so much!” Gu Lei’s face bore a look of regret. As a toxic cultivator, he thrived on battlefields—his mere presence could annihilate entire armies.

“No rush. Li Tianzhi and the Star River Four Thieves have already headed to the Thunder Domain. I’m sure it’ll be troubled soon. When the time comes, we’ll eradicate the Thunder Domain—after all, we can’t always be bullied!” Zheng Xin’s expression turned icy. This war had solidified their hatred for the Thunder Domain.

“Alright!” Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan exhaled deeply, exchanging glances. Their eyes gleamed with excitement.

“A massive inter-domain teleportation array! Completed!” Wan Lingkong’s face radiated pride, even Jiang Nanxuan—usually composed—showed rare excitement.

“Seriously? Don’t teleport us to the Divine and Demon Domain’s abyss!” Zheng Xin doubted Wan Lingkong’s claim, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Luotian and Nan Gong Yuqing also harbored doubts. However, upon glancing at Jiang Nanxuan, they felt reassured—his expression suggested near certainty. If he lacked confidence, he wouldn’t have looked so resolute.

Luotian said nothing more. He grabbed Zheng Xin, who was still chattering, and stepped onto the teleportation array. He nodded at Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong.

Without hesitation, the two activated the main banner. A colossal teleportation force enveloped them, vanishing from the Flame Domain.

“Hum…” The resonance spread, as if traversing an endless journey. They materialized beneath a starry expanse.

“This is the Divine and Demon Domain!” Wan Lingkong’s voice trembled with excitement as he gazed at the surrounding stars and the dark void.

“Indeed, this is the Divine and Demon Domain! And it’s precise—there, that’s the Demon Clan’s continent!” The elder’s weathered finger pointed forward. A black continent emerged within their line of sight.

“The Demon Clan? You didn’t expect me to return, did you?” The elder’s face bore a mix of excitement and trembling as he stared at the vast land resembling a black hole.

“After so many years, this day has finally arrived!” Nan Gong Yuqing tightened his grip on the blood-red long sword in his hand, his voice equally stirred.

Chapter 1043: The Demon Lord’s Mandate

The Divine and Demon Domain, the second largest of the Nine Domains. Its star domain spanned several times that of the Four Sacred Star Domains, its vast expanse rife with tangled power structures. The Divine Clan and the Demon Clan jointly governed this immense domain.

The Divine Clan held dominance, while the Demon Clan remained weaker. Yet no one dared underestimate them. Even the other domains’ sacred sects treated the Demon Clan as equals. After all, to rival the Divine Clan in this vast domain required formidable strength and deep-rooted heritage.

A black planet, its entire land cloaked in darkness. From afar, it resembled a void, instilling unease.

“This is the Demon Clan’s continent!” The elder’s face lit with a smile, his voice tinged with excitement as he gazed at the black land.

“Indeed, the Demon Clan. This land alone is enough to instill dread!” Luotian’s gaze bore deep concentration as he observed the black continent.

“Let’s go. See what the Demon Clan has become!” The elder smiled, leading Luotian and the others into the land.

At the heart of the Demon Clan’s continent stood a towering black mountain, its peak piercing the clouds. Palaces lined the summit—this was the core of the Demon Clan’s domain.

In an instant, Luotian and his group materialized at the base of the towering mountain, their faces etched with awe.

Two disciples in black robes, at the Superhuman stage, stood outside the gates. Upon seeing Luotian’s group, they immediately adopted a wary stance: “State your name, or it shall be deemed an insult to the Demon Clan!”

“Tell Nan Gong Liang that Nan Gong Bo has returned with Nan Gong Yuqing!” The elder’s voice echoed in the disciples’ ears, causing their faces to flicker with surprise.

“Late Saint stage!” The disciples sensed Nan Gong Bo’s cultivation before bowing respectfully to the elder: “Please wait.”

“Elder, why don’t we just enter? Why must they welcome us?” Zheng Xin’s face bore confusion, his gaze cautious.

“Wan Xiong, Jiang Xiong. You two go set up a grand formation to encircle this continent!” Luotian’s calm expression directed the words toward them.

Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing had been exiled from the Demon Clan for years, and clearly, the clan had undergone drastic changes. Luotian couldn’t afford to be careless—these people weren’t here to die.

“Understood. The Demon Clan’s bastards, if they dare act, I’ll gift them a grand present!” Wan Lingkong’s face bore cold determination. He and Jiang Nanxuan rushed beyond the domain, circling the entire Demon Clan continent.

Luotian, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Elder Nan Gong Bo stood at the gates of the Demon Clan’s mountain, waiting for the clan’s representatives to descend.

Not long after, two Superhuman disciples descended from the mountain. Their faces bore suspicion: “Sorry, our clan elders claim they don’t recognize you! Tell them to go as far away as possible!”

“Ha! Seems I’ve been gone too long. Those old bastards have forgotten me—forgotten the might of Grandmaster Nan Gong!” Nan Gong Bo’s cold laugh echoed. His weathered face bore anger.

“Since they won’t let us in, we’ll enter ourselves. I’ll see what they can do to old man!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore coldness as he strode toward the black gates, ignoring the two Superhuman disciples.

“Stay put! This is the Demon Clan. You can’t run wild here!” The two disciples’ faces darkened—this was the first time anyone had dared to challenge the Demon Clan’s mountain. Even the Divine Clan wouldn’t dare such a move.

“Move aside!” Nan Gong Bo’s cold snort released his Late Saint stage aura, instantly knocking the two disciples to the ground.

“You…” The two Superhuman disciples knew they couldn’t match Nan Gong Bo. Yet, this was the Demon Clan—they weren’t afraid. Even a Late Saint stage opponent wouldn’t stop them from rebuking.

“You’re seeking death, do you know? Since the Demon Clan’s emergence, no one has dared to run wild on our mountain!” The two disciples couldn’t speak without suppression. Yet Nan Gong Bo scorned to strike them.

“Crunch…” Zheng Xin stomped on one disciple’s face, a smile playing on his lips.

“Kid, do you know who he is? He might be the future Grandmaster of the Demon Clan. He could even be their future Saint Prince!” Zheng Xin pointed at Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing, his voice resounding.

Gu Lei did the same, stomping on another disciple’s face. Both were troublemakers—this visit to the Demon Clan would be no easy task.

“What?” The two Superhuman disciples’ faces bore disbelief, their eyes darting between Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Nan Gong Bo? Is that you, Grandmaster? The one who was as close to the old master as a brother!” Their voices trembled with disbelief.

“Indeed, I vanished!” Nan Gong Bo’s weathered face bore a cold smile. His black hand凝聚, striking the void.

“Boom…” Demon energy surged as his black palm smashed against the mountain.

“Nan Gong Liang, if you don’t come out now, I’ll truly attack the mountain. If my clan’s secrets are awakened, is that acceptable?” Nan Gong Bo smiled, addressing the mountain.

“Who! Who dares to run wild on my Demon Clan’s mountain? Don’t you know you’re begging for death!”

“Nan Gong Bo? Who is he, his name sounds like a member of our clan. He dares to call the Grandmaster by name—his status within the clan must be high. Yet why do I sense such endless anger in his voice?” The Demon Clan’s disciples’ eyes flickered with confusion as they appeared at the mountain gates, surrounding Luotian’s group.

“Who are you for trespassing our Demon Clan’s mountain? This crime deserves death!” A resounding voice echoed, followed by an immense pressure that enveloped the mountain. Simultaneously, a black demon sword descended from the sky, piercing toward Luotian’s group.

“Ha! Nan Gong Liang, do you think I’d return with Yuqing without confidence?” Nan Gong Bo smiled, his hand striking the demon energy. A massive black hand emerged, seizing the black demon sword.

“No matter who you are, daring to run wild on my Demon Clan’s mountain—death is your fate!” A chorus of rebukes echoed from the summit. As figures appeared in the sky, Luotian’s group furrowed their brows.

“Ha! I wonder how many old friends remain!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore coldness, his voice sharp. The black demon sword in his hand roared as if trying to break free.

“Go back!” Nan Gong Bo didn’t hesitate. His hand struck, and the black demon sword flew from his grasp, vanishing instantly.

“Boom…” A mist of blood erupted from the sky, coalescing into a pale-faced elder.

“Fourth Elder!” The Demon Clan’s disciples’ faces shifted, their eyes wide with shock as they gazed at the elder forming before them.

“Who is this man, so powerful and dominant? He single-handedly defeated a Superhuman stage Fourth Elder!” The disciples’ faces bore awe.

“Seek death!” A dozen black-robed elders descended to the ground. The eldest, a Late Saint stage elder, bore fierce intent as he gazed at Nan Gong Bo.

“Order all Demon Clan disciples! These people trespassed our mountain. Join me in killing them!” The elder’s cold gaze flickered, still unwilling to grant Nan Gong Bo a chance to speak.

“Hear our command!” The Demon Clan disciples roared, their voices filled with excitement. Black energy surged, enveloping the entire mountain.

“Ha! Nan Gong Liang, what are you? You dare to command the Demon Clan’s disciples!” Nan Gong Bo laughed aloud. His aura surged, facing the millions of disciples and the Grandmaster Nan Gong Liang atop the mountain. His face bore no fear.

“By virtue of being the current Grandmaster of the Demon Clan, by virtue of my Late Saint stage cultivation, and by virtue of the three elders supporting me!” Nan Gong Liang’s voice echoed in Nan Gong Bo’s mind.

“If you return, do you think there’ll be any change? The Demon Clan values strength. Do you think reaching Late Saint stage will turn the tide? Don’t dream it. Look at how many of Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s forces remain—most are now my people. The rest are neutral!” Nan Gong Liang’s voice carried mockery.

“If I were you, I’d cower and stay low. I never thought you’d survive this long—yet here you are, daring to return!” Nan Gong Liang’s voice dripped with scorn.

“Ha! You’re the Grandmaster of the Demon Clan. Then see what this is!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore a smile as he flipped his hand, revealing a black token. Though small, its aura was formidable, causing the crowd to startle. A single character “Demon” was carved into it, its age evident.

“Demon Lord’s Mandate!” The Demon Clan disciples’ faces bore shock as they gazed at the black token in Nan Gong Bo’s hand, exclaiming.

The Demon Clan follows strength. The Demon Lord’s Mandate symbolizes each Grandmaster. This tradition has persisted until now. Every clan assembly, the Grandmaster is challenged by elders and disciples. If one defeats the Grandmaster, they inherit the Demon Lord’s Mandate. However, if the challenge fails, it means insulting the Grandmaster’s authority—losing one’s life.

The Grandmaster defeated isn’t killed but retreats to become an elder. Thus, every clan elder—whether their power or lineage—is formidable. They or their ancestors once held the Demon Lord’s Mandate.

“How did it end up in his hands?” The disciples’ faces bore confusion, their tension easing as they gazed at Nan Gong Bo before turning to Nan Gong Liang.

“Nan Gong Liang, this matter requires an explanation!” A neutral elder’s face bore a smile as he addressed Nan Gong Liang.

“Nan Gong Bo, welcome back!” A elder laughed, stepping forward and extending his hand, eyes filled with excitement.

“I never thought you’d survive. After Nan Gong Liang and the others returned, I felt Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s death was suspicious. I never imagined this bastard had been hiding it all these years! Regrettable, Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s family perished in that war!” The elder, at the middle Saint stage, bore a sigh.

“Ha! Nan Gong Kai, I never thought you’d still be so naive!” Nan Gong Bo smiled, relieved to finally be recognized. He clashed his hand with Nan Gong Kai’s.

“Nan Gong Bo, you’re Nan Gong Bo!” Another elder behind Nan Gong Liang bore a look of disbelief. Yet only one elder flew toward Nan Gong Bo.

Nan Gong Bo sighed inwardly. The remaining supporters of Grandmaster Nan Gong De were now only two factions, saddening him. No doubt they’d been eliminated by Nan Gong Liang over the years.

“Nan Gong Liang, though our clan values strength, it never said we could usurp the Grandmaster’s position through deceit. According to clan rules, you should die!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore coldness as he addressed Nan Gong Liang.

“Ha! Nan Gong Bo, what do you mean? You claim I deceived Grandmaster Nan Gong De. Do you have proof? I think it’s you who coveted my position, deceived Grandmaster Nan Gong De, and sought the Demon Lord’s Mandate!” Nan Gong Liang laughed, his eyes filled with mockery.

“Nan Gong Bo, I advise you to hand over the Demon Lord’s Mandate and confess your crime. Otherwise, I’ll make you suffer endlessly—peel your skin, pull out your sinews, and roast you for forty-nine days on demon flames!” Before Nan Gong Bo could respond, he continued.

“Nan Gong Liang, you’re truly shameless! Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s son was taken by me. Now he’s back, and the witness is here. What do you say now?” Nan Gong Bo spoke solemnly, returning to Nan Gong Yuqing’s side. His gaze was icy.

“You’re Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s son, Nan Gong Yuqing? Ha! When I last saw you, you were a baby. I never thought you’d grow so large!” Nan Gong Kai and another elder bore excitement, their eyes wide as they gazed at Nan Gong Yuqing. They didn’t need to scrutinize him—when their eyes met his face, they knew he was Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s son. He resembled him too much.

“Ha! Nan Gong Bo, you just pulled a random kid off the street and called him Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s son. Who can’t do that? I could say my son is Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s!” Nan Gong Liang extended his hand, pulling a young man beside him—none other than the current Saint Prince of the Demon Clan, Nan Gong Tuo.

“Exactly! Who knows if this kid is even from here? Maybe he’s your son!”
“I could say my son is Grandmaster Nan Gong De’s too!” The sky erupted with several elders joining in, clearly supporters of Nan Gong Liang.

“Damn shameless! I’ve never seen such brazen arrogance in my life. The Demon Clan has truly taught me a lesson!” Zheng Xin muttered under his breath, not loud enough for the crowd to miss. None of them were lacking in perception—Zheng Xin’s words echoed clearly.

“Exactly! The Demon Clan, do you remember me? I was the one you chased out!” Zheng Xin’s words hadn’t finished when Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan appeared at the mountain gates. Their brows were drenched in sweat, clearly having put in great effort.

“Wan Lingkong! You dare return to my Demon Clan? I mean, are you brave or a fool? Back then, you ran like a lost dog. Now that you’ve reached the early Saint stage, do you think you can provoke my Demon Clan? Even your ancestor Wan Chongwu couldn’t do that!” The Demon Clan’s Saint Prince Nan Gong Tuo spoke, his voice brimming with arrogance.

“Ha! You really are fat and proud. If my family had been at its peak, would you dare speak like that? The Demon Clan’s Saint Prince—such a big name. Two of your predecessors have been killed, and you still dare to talk nonsense here. Be careful next time!” Wan Lingkong laughed, standing behind Nan Gong Bo.

The atmosphere of the Demon Clan turned icy. Everyone’s expressions were hostile, glaring at Nan Gong Bo and his group.

“Luotian!” At that moment, as people scrutinized Luotian’s group, all their expressions shifted dramatically. Their faces bore intense hostility.

Luotian smiled without saying a word. He knew that arguing with these people was futile.

“Luotian, you killed my Demon Clan’s two Saint Princes. Yet here you are, bold enough to come back! You’re truly daring!” An elder rebuked, his face filled with anger. After all, the one killed in the Ancient Heaven Palace by Nan Gong Yuqing was his descendant—possibly the next Grandmaster.

Another elder bore fierce intent, gazing at Luotian. In the entrance of the Demon Domain to the Flame Domain, Luotian had killed this elder’s descendant.

“What’s wrong with that? Your Saint Princes trespassed on my treasures and attacked first. Did I stand there to let them kill me?” Luotian spoke softly.

“Kid, you’re dead!” Two elders’ faces darkened. Their hostility was unhidden as they flew toward Luotian.

“You think I’m a doormat!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore a cold smile. He stood before Luotian, releasing waves of black energy.

Luotian also slowly retrieved his crackling spear. Two middle Saint stage opponents weren’t worth drawing the Heaven-Defying Bow.

“You…” The two elders halted, their faces grim. They were middle Saint stage—combined, they still couldn’t match Nan Gong Bo.

“Ha! The Demon Clan, do you think I’m still that weakling you used to oppress?” Luotian stepped forward, his gaze mocking as he addressed the elders in the sky.

“You believe I’ll die here? If I do, your entire Demon Clan will be buried with me!”
“Today, if I die here, the Four Sacred Star Domains, Flame Domain, and Demon Domain will descend upon the Divine and Demon Domain within seven days. We’ll eradicate your mountain completely! Do you believe it?” Luotian’s voice rang out, resounding in everyone’s ears.

“Do you believe it?” Everyone heard Luotian’s words, causing Nan Gong Liang and others’ faces to darken.

Luotian was right. From his current background, the Three Domains likely had deep ties with him.

The Four Sacred Star Domains were weak before, but the Demon Clan might have overlooked them. However, after their battle with the Thunder Domain, they had become a formidable force among the Nine Domains. The Flame Domain wasn’t strong either, but its alchemy sect was a terrifying number. If they mobilized their vast network, it would be a formidable force.

Plus the Demon Domain’s Diao Yuanshan, a half-step Epoch Master who had slain a Thunder Domain Saint Peak. Clearly, he was closely tied to Luotian. Even the Demon Domain’s Saint Peak wouldn’t dare reveal their true face to kill Luotian.

One force might not matter, but three forces combined would be a dangerous threat for the Demon Clan. Unless their hidden strength remained dormant, it was truly perilous.

“Hmph! What does that matter? The Demon Clan has never feared anything. Your background is strong, but killing our two Saint Princes and daring to provoke us here—unless you die, we won’t be able to stand in the Nine Domains!” Nan Gong Liang’s face bore fierce intent, his voice domineering. If they let Luotian leave, it would be too humiliating and disrespectful.

“Don’t act foolishly. You’re underestimating the Demon Clan, underestimating our methods!” One elder’s face bore disdain as he addressed Luotian.

“Kill!” The Demon Clan disciples’ faces turned icy. They growled lowly, their demon energy surging and enveloping the sky in darkness.

“Old fool! You want to play? Today, I’ll let the entire Demon Clan die with us!” Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan stood beside Luotian. Two golden banners in their hands glowed like twin suns, illuminating the entire mountain.

Chapter 1044: The Unreliable Ancestors

On the Demon Clan’s mountain, Luotian radiated golden light. Nan Gong Yuqing held his blood-red long sword tightly. Zheng Xin and the others gazed at the Demon Clan elders and disciples surrounding them, their expressions tense.

Killing intent filled the air. The invisible tension wrapped around Luotian’s group, as the Demon Clan disciples and elders stared at them with cold faces.

Luotian, the Saint Prince Killer. This title had spread across the Nine Domains. How many Saint Princes had died at his hands? The Demon Clan’s two Saint Princes were seen as slain by Luotian. This deep enmity had ignited the Demon Clan’s fury, even causing two factions supporting Nan Gong Bo to fall silent.

“Nan Gong Bo, you’ve allied with my Demon Clan’s enemy. What are your true intentions?” Nan Gong Liang’s face bore mockery.

“Ha! Old dog Nan Gong Liang, do you think you’ve got us? Today, if we die, all of you will perish with us. The entire Demon Clan continent will also be buried!” Wan Lingkong stood there, his face mocking. His golden banner glowed like the sun.

“First, let you witness what a formation genius is!” Wan Lingkong smiled. He thrust his golden banner into the void.

The golden banner pierced through the Demon Clan’s continent, like a meteor streaking into space. In an instant, the stars erupted with light. A series of banners, like stars, enveloped the entire Demon Clan continent.

“Hum…” A violent fluctuation rose from the starry expanse, causing everyone’s faces to shift slightly. Even Luotian was no exception.

“Wan Lingkong, you bastard! You’re dragging us all to death!” Black clouds enveloped the entire Demon Clan continent, plunging it into darkness. Gu Lei and Zheng Xin cursed loudly.

“What else could I do? If we’re surrounded by these beasts, what path is left for us? Better to fight together! At least no one below Late Saint stage will have a chance!” Wan Lingkong shrugged, his face indifferent.

The Demon Clan disciples cursed inwardly. Sensing the immense pressure from beyond the domain, their auras gradually faded. They watched the sky anxiously before turning to gaze at Nan Gong Liang.

Seeing their gazes, Nan Gong Liang’s face darkened. He was momentarily flustered.

“Celestial Punishment Formation! Wan Lingkong, you’re about to make the entire Demon Clan continent endure a heavenly trial!” Luotian exclaimed in alarm, his voice filled with fear. He stared at Wan Lingkong as if seeing a monster.

How many people lived in the Demon Clan continent? No one could count. If the formation was activated, the entire continent would be caught in it—this was the terrifying power of a formation master.

“Exactly! I said we’d play big, didn’t I? Of course, it’s the biggest!” Wan Lingkong’s eyes held innocence.

“But don’t worry. This is just a corner of it. The formation hasn’t fully activated yet!” Wan Lingkong said, producing two more banners in his hand. Jiang Nanxuan also had three banners, their eagerness evident.

Everyone’s mouths twitched. Seeing Wan Lingkong’s madness, he seemed like a formation maniac—any slight disagreement would have him launch his banners.

“Damn, this is just a corner. The pressure’s already so intense. If it were fully activated…!” People couldn’t imagine.

“Apocalypse and destruction!” Everyone gasped, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan.

“F***, you bastard. Why go this big? These few Late Saint stages could’ve stopped us! Don’t forget, Luotian was able to kill a Late Saint stage when he was early Saint!” Zheng Xin cursed loudly.

“Uh…” Wan Lingkong was taken aback. Hearing Zheng Xin’s words, he thought of Luotian’s past victories and felt a slight embarrassment.

“Sorry, I was too excited. Too excited. If the formation were activated, it would be absolutely terrifying. Every formation master would want to see it activate!” Wan Lingkong scratched his head, gazing at Jiang Nanxuan.

Zheng Xin and Gu Lei wanted to curse but saw the usually composed Jiang Nanxuan’s eyes also gleamed with eagerness. Their mouths twitched.

The two groups were now at an impasse. Neither side dared to provoke the other. Luotian’s group, despite their power, wouldn’t risk eradicating the entire Demon Clan. The Demon Clan’s Saint Peak masters hadn’t appeared yet. If they did, Wan Lingkong’s formations might indeed be activated, giving them time to escape.

Luotian always held the Heaven Palace Seal. After all, this was the Demon Clan’s mountain—its depth was terrifying. He couldn’t afford to be careless.

The Demon Clan side also feared greatly. After all, the formation beyond the domain wasn’t a joke. The Demon Clan’s ancestors rarely intervened in matters. If the formation were truly activated, even these people would perish.

Plus Luotian had previously killed a Late Saint stage. Nan Gong Bo wasn’t someone to be trifled with either. If they fought, these Late Saint stages would also perish.

“What’s happening!” As the two sides remained at an impasse, a resounding voice echoed. Three figures appeared above them. An immense pressure made Luotian’s group tense.

“Saint Peak! The Demon Clan has finally produced a Saint Peak master!” Luotian’s group sighed in awe, their tension palpable.

“Elder Ancestors!” Nan Gong Liang and the other elders bowed respectfully, kneeling before them. The Demon Clan disciples also knelt, their eyes filled with fervor as they gazed at the three elders above.

“Elder Ancestors, these people insulted our Demon Clan. Please subdue them!” Nan Gong Liang spoke loudly, his voice respectful.

“Elder Ancestors, do you remember Nan Gong Bo?” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore a complex expression. He knelt before the ground, pulling Nan Gong Yuqing to kneel as well.

“Nan Gong Bo? He was the brother-in-arms of the previous Grandmaster, wasn’t he?” The eldest Saint Peak master recalled before speaking softly.

“Indeed, my lord!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore respect. After all, they were his grandfather.

“Oh… I ask you, what happened to the previous Grandmaster Nan Gong De?” The elder clearly didn’t know how Nan Gong Yuqing’s father died. His face bore inquiry.

“Those three old fools are too thick-headed! The Demon Clan doesn’t even know their Grandmaster is dead…” Luotian’s group felt speechless as they gazed at the three Saint Peak masters above.

Nan Gong Bo recounted how he had died, and how Nan Gong Liang and the Divine Clan had framed him.

Hearing Nan Gong Bo’s words, the eldest elder’s face darkened. Even the other two elders who had kept their eyes closed opened them, their gazes flashing with intensity as they scanned Nan Gong Liang.

“Bold indeed! We allow you to fight, but not with treachery. You’ve gone too far—cooperating with the Divine Clan. How can we allow this?” The eldest elder raised his hand, pressing down on Nan Gong Liang.

“Elder Ancestors, I’m innocent!” Nan Gong Liang, seeing the black hand, no longer held his Grandmaster’s posture. The immense pressure made him kneel instantly.

The black hand halted before touching Nan Gong Liang. The eldest elder’s voice echoed: “Speak, how are you innocent?”

“Elder Ancestors, he has no evidence. Don’t believe his one-sided story. It was Nan Gong Bo who coveted my Grandmaster position, murdered the old Grandmaster!” Nan Gong Liang cried out loudly. The three Saint Peak elders furrowed their brows.

Nan Gong Bo’s face darkened, his anger nearly spilling over. Yet he had no evidence—his gaze turned to the three elders above. If they sided with Nan Gong Liang, he would fight to the death to kill him and avenge his brother-in-arms, Nan Gong De.

The three elders pondered for a while. They exchanged silent thoughts before speaking: “This matter requires further investigation. However, since Nan Gong Bo has returned with the Demon Lord’s Mandate after so many years, we must uphold our rules. Since he has the Mandate, he is now the Grandmaster of the Demon Clan. Nan Gong Yuqing shall be the Saint Prince!”

“What!” Nan Gong Liang and the others bore disbelief, their eyes wide as they gazed at the three elders.

Luotian’s group also stared in bewilderment at the three Saint Peak masters. They sighed inwardly, wondering if these old fools were senile—granting the Grandmaster position to Nan Gong Bo outright.

Chapter 1045: The Unreliable Ancestors

The Demon Clan’s mountain, Luotian radiated golden light. Nan Gong Yuqing held his blood-red long sword tightly. Zheng Xin and the others gazed at the Demon Clan elders and disciples surrounding them, their expressions tense.

Killing intent filled the air. The invisible tension wrapped around Luotian’s group, as the Demon Clan disciples and elders stared at them with cold faces.

“Sorry, I was too excited. Too excited. If the formation were activated, it would be absolutely terrifying. Every formation master would want to see it activate!” Wan Lingkong scratched his head, gazing at Jiang Nanxuan.

Zheng Xin and Gu Lei wanted to curse but saw the usually composed Jiang Nanxuan’s eyes also gleamed with eagerness. Their mouths twitched.

The two groups were now at an impasse. Neither side dared to provoke the other. Luotian’s group, despite their power, wouldn’t risk eradicating the entire Demon Clan. The Demon Clan’s Saint Peak masters hadn’t appeared yet. If they did, Wan Lingkong’s formations might indeed be activated, giving them time to escape.

Luotian always held the Heaven Palace Seal. After all, this was the Demon Clan’s mountain—its depth was terrifying. He couldn’t afford to be careless.

The Demon Clan side also feared greatly. After all, the formation beyond the domain wasn’t a joke. The Demon Clan’s ancestors rarely intervened in matters. If the formation were truly activated, even these people would perish.

Plus Luotian had previously killed a Late Saint stage. Nan Gong Bo wasn’t someone to be trifled with either. If they fought, these Late Saint stages would also perish.

“What’s happening!” As the two sides remained at an impasse, a resounding voice echoed. Three figures appeared above them. An immense pressure made Luotian’s group tense.

“Saint Peak! The Demon Clan has finally produced a Saint Peak master!” Luotian’s group sighed in awe, their tension palpable.

“Elder Ancestors!” Nan Gong Liang and the other elders bowed respectfully, kneeling before them. The Demon Clan disciples also knelt, their eyes filled with fervor as they gazed at the three elders above.

“Elder Ancestors, these people insulted our Demon Clan. Please subdue them!” Nan Gong Liang spoke loudly, his voice respectful.

“Elder Ancestors, do you remember Nan Gong Bo?” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore a complex expression. He knelt before the ground, pulling Nan Gong Yuqing to kneel as well.

“Nan Gong Bo? He was the brother-in-arms of the previous Grandmaster, wasn’t he?” The eldest Saint Peak master recalled before speaking softly.

“Indeed, my lord!” Nan Gong Bo’s face bore respect. After all, they were his grandfather.

“Oh… I ask you, what happened to the previous Grandmaster Nan Gong De?” The elder clearly didn’t know how Nan Gong Yuqing’s father died. His face bore inquiry.

“Those three old fools are too thick-headed! The Demon Clan doesn’t even know their Grandmaster is dead…” Luotian’s group felt speechless as they gazed at the three Saint Peak masters above.

Nan Gong Bo recounted how he had died, and how Nan Gong Liang and the Divine Clan had framed him.

Hearing Nan Gong Bo’s words, the eldest elder’s face darkened. Even the other two elders who had kept their eyes closed opened them, their gazes flashing with intensity as they scanned Nan Gong Liang.

“Bold indeed! We allow you to fight, but not with treachery. You’ve gone too far—cooperating with the Divine Clan. How can we allow this?” The eldest elder raised his hand, pressing down on Nan Gong Liang.

“Elder Ancestors, I’m innocent!” Nan Gong Liang, seeing the black hand, no longer held his Grandmaster’s posture. The immense pressure made him kneel instantly.

The black hand halted before touching Nan Gong Liang. The eldest elder’s voice echoed: “Speak, how are you innocent?”

“Elder Ancestors, he has no evidence. Don’t believe his one-sided story. It was Nan Gong Bo who coveted my Grandmaster position, murdered the old Grandmaster!” Nan Gong Liang cried out loudly. The three Saint Peak elders furrowed their brows.

Nan Gong Bo’s face darkened, his anger nearly spilling over. Yet he had no evidence—his gaze turned to the three elders above. If they sided with Nan Gong Liang, he would fight to the death to kill him and avenge his brother-in-arms, Nan Gong De.

The three elders pondered for a while. They exchanged silent thoughts before speaking: “This matter requires further investigation. However, since Nan Gong Bo has returned with the Demon Lord’s Mandate after so many years, we must uphold our rules. Since he has the Mandate, he is now the Grandmaster of the Demon Clan. Nan Gong Yuqing shall be the Saint Prince!”

“What!” Nan Gong Liang and the others bore disbelief, their eyes wide as they gazed at the three elders.

Luotian’s group also stared in bewilderment at the three Saint Peak masters. They sighed inwardly, wondering if these old fools were senile—granting the Grandmaster position to Nan Gong Bo outright.
