Luo Tian's two martial arts techniques left them deeply impressed. In their view, even a peak Bone-Devouring strength would struggle to survive against these techniques. Yet Yang Huanyu, merely at the late Bone-Devouring stage, had managed to survive.

“Zhi…” Under people’s trembling gazes, the firestorm finally extinguished completely, leaving behind a charred ground.

“Luo Tian, you cannot kill me. Though I am powerless against you, to let me die is no easy task. Do not compare me with Li Xiuping, who you once killed—he was merely a dog under my command. Today’s debt I Yang Huanyu shall remember. When I reach the peak of Bone-Devouring, I will claim your life. Everything you possess shall be mine!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes glowed with a crimson light, like a wolf spotting its prey.

“Do you think I would grant you an opportunity to flee?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, his hand flashing a streak of gray qi.

Yet this gray qi was unlike Yang Huanyu’s destructive primordial energy—it was the essence of death.

Clenching his fists, Luo Tian’s knuckles cracked audibly. Without hesitation, he launched the Destruction of Life Fist toward Yang Huanyu.

As Luo Tian’s fist surged forward, a powerful surge of primordial energy erupted from Yang Huanyu. His back glowed with golden light, radiating a metallic sheen.

Luo Tian’s expression turned puzzled; he could not fathom what Yang Huanyu was up to in this situation.

But soon, Luo Tian understood with a start. His gaze locked onto the two icy, steel-like wings that unfurled after the golden light faded.

“Aurora Wings!” Luo Tian murmured, stunned. He had never expected Yang Huanyu to possess such a technique.

Aurora Wings—Luo Tian was not seeing them for the first time. Back in Tianyuan City, Tiantian of the Gu family had possessed a pair. Now, seeing those metallic-gleaming wings, he was unsurprised.

“Hu…” Yang Huanyu’s face twisted into a mocking smile as his Aurora Wings fluttered. His body ascended into the sky.

The Destruction of Life Fist, radiating immense power, swept over the spot Yang Huanyu had occupied. Where it passed, life was severed. A channel of death energy formed between Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu’s former position.

Seeing this, Yang Huanyu’s face finally contorted in alarm. He let out a low cry: “The essence of the Wood element!”

Yang Huanyu could clearly sense that Luo Tian’s seemingly ordinary punch, if it had landed on him, would have left him crippled even if he survived. This solidified his resolve to retreat temporarily.

Yet Luo Tian would not grant him the slightest chance. His body’s Wood-element primordial energy transformed into death essence, converging onto his fist.

“One… two… eight…”

The thunderous sound echoed endlessly in the sky, dozens of fist shadows materializing. Each radiated an annihilating aura, charging toward Yang Huanyu.

Though Yang Huanyu hovered in the sky, his Aurora Wings were not true primordial energy wings but artificial constructs. Faced with this dense swarm of fists, he dodged desperately—but still took a hit.

The Destruction of Life Fist struck Yang Huanyu, and under the stunned gazes of onlookers, he lost a century’s worth of vitality, rapidly aging.

“Puk…” He spat blood, enduring the agony of losing his life force. He evaded Luo Tian’s final punch, his eyes burning with hatred.

“Luo Tian, remember this—your actions have enraged me. The next time we meet, everything you possess shall be mine!” Yang Huanyu hissed, his Aurora Wings flaring with light before vanishing into the sky.

Chapter 387: Establishing a Name ()

Chapter 387: Establishing a Name

“Fled? Fled?” Dongbo Yongsi and others watched Yang Huanyu vanish, their faces etched with shock.

“Alas… he truly escaped,” Luo Tian’s eyes carried disappointment. He knew that unless Yang Huanyu fought him directly, he could not detain the latter.

As for Yang Huanyu having taken one of his Destruction of Life Fists, Luo Tian was not particularly concerned. In his view, while this punch could harm an ordinary person significantly, it meant little to Yang Huanyu, who had already caused him headaches.

The numerous Tianshi Sect elders watching Yang Huanyu’s escape showed no fear—instead, a faint fervor flickered in their eyes.

“Boom…” The elder at the peak of Bone-Devouring launched the first attack, his body suffused with blood qi. His face bore a sickly flush as he ignited his life essence, his cultivation surging instantly. Two punches shattered Qiu Chouyan and Zheng Xin away, leaving only Long Baobao struggling to endure.

At the same time, the remaining Tianshi Sect elders—reduced to under two hundred after being battered by Yuling Sect disciples—fervently ignited their life essence, faces alight with madness. In an instant, the two hundred managed to subdue over seven hundred Yuling Sect disciples.

This sudden outburst caused heavy losses among the Yuling Sect, with over a hundred dying under the Tianshi Sect’s assault.

The sky roared with thunderous explosions, the mountain range above erupting in boundless blood qi. Luo Tian’s face shifted as he watched Yuling Sect disciples perish under the Tianshi Sect elders’ hands, his expression betraying a flicker of reluctance.

Though these Yuling Sect disciples were strangers to him, some even had conflicts with him previously, they were still living beings.

With a flash of movement, he appeared before Qiu Chouyan and Qiu Chouyan, supporting the two who were bleeding from their mouths.

“You’ve worked hard. Now it’s my turn!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out to the crowd. “Yuling Sect disciples, listen up! Everyone, fall behind me!”

“Luo Tian?” Dongbo Yongsi was currently locked in a duel with a late Bone-Devouring Tianshi Sect elder. Previously, he had dominated the opponent, but after the latter ignited all his life essence, he was swiftly overpowered and severely wounded.

Not only Dongbo Yongsi—others were in the same boat. Some had already ignited their life essence, otherwise they would not have stood a chance against the Tianshi Sect’s sudden surge.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Yuling Sect disciples’ eyes lit up instinctively. They turned their bodies and rushed behind Luo Tian.

An hour later, the remaining four hundred Yuling Sect disciples finally gathered behind Luo Tian.

“Flame Dragon Hands!” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, fire dragons roaring toward the remaining over a hundred Tianshi Sect elders.

“One… three… ten…”

“Thirty!” Thirty fire dragons burst forth from all directions, surging toward the Tianshi Sect.

At this moment, the Tianshi Sect elders seemed to have lost their senses, charging headlong into the fire dragons without hesitation.

“I’ll make a big move!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, sensing the thirty fire dragons dispersing. He let out a low growl.

“Fen Tian, Inferno Array!” Luo Tian’s hands slammed onto the ground, and the thirty fire dragons spread out, surrounding the Tianshi Sect elders.

“Boom…” After Luo Tian’s hands pressed into the ground, a thunderous explosion erupted. The entire mountain range was engulfed in fire, instantly surrounding the over a hundred Tianshi Sect elders. The terrifying heat forced Dongbo Yongsi and others to retreat.

“Reversing Heaven!” The Yuling Sect disciples could only mutter this word to describe Luo Tian.

One person fighting over a hundred life-essence ignited Tianshi Sect elders—this was their first time witnessing such an act. At this moment, Luo Tian’s status among them could no longer be described as merely “strong.”

“Firestorms surged, filling the hundred-mile radius with flames. These over a hundred Tianshi Sect elders were reduced to ashes in an instant, most merely struggling for a few moments.

Of course, there were those who defied fate—like the peak Bone-Devouring elder, who had broken through the firestorm but was already too weak to fight.

Qiu Chouyan pierced his throat with a sword, while Zheng Xin smashed his chest with a hammer, sending him back into the fire.

Luo Tian’s face turned pale. His qi was completely drained, and even detonating thirty fire dragons had been a struggle. A regular peak Bone-Devouring strength would have failed utterly—this was the true power of Luo Tian’s Five Elements Body, which possessed several times more qi than ordinary people.

People gazed at the firestorm with awe, their eyes filled with admiration as they looked toward Luo Tian.

“Junior Sect Leader!” Someone’s low voice broke the silence.

This call was no small matter; it triggered a chain reaction. Four hundred people shouted in unison, their gazes burning with fervor toward Luo Tian.

Qiu Chouyan’s black veil concealed a faint smile of satisfaction. She knew Luo Tian’s position as junior sect leader was now solid—these four hundred people had fully accepted him.

“Junior Sect Leader, I apologize for my past offenses. Please forgive me!” Dongbo Yongsi’s eyes flickered with bitterness before he approached Luo Tian, his expression sincere as he clasped his fists.

With Dongbo Yongsi’s lead, the other dozen disciples also showed signs of acceptance and apologized.

With Zheng Xin supporting him, Luo Tian’s face was pale as he softly said to the crowd: “No harm done. Go and rescue Duan Xingchen; I’m sure he’s suffered a lot!”

No need for Luo Tian to command—someone had already carried the weakened Duan Xingchen out.

Though Duan Xingchen was wounded all over, his eyes were sharp and clear. He watched the vast firestorm, suspecting it was Luo Tian’s doing. A sense of admiration arose within him as he clasped his fists toward Luo Tian: “Thank you this time. I Duan Xingchen owe you a debt of gratitude. If you ever need help, I will certainly come to your aid!”

“Haha, it was a small effort. Nothing major,” Luo Tian nodded lightly.

“But I won’t give up on Qiu Chouyan. Be ready to face my challenge anytime—perhaps I’ll take her from your side!” Duan Xingchen’s voice was resolute.

Luo Tian chuckled and waved his hand, leaving the hundred unharmed to clean up the battlefield while the rest began recovering their injuries.

After an hour of activity, they returned to the dragon’s back and flew toward Yuling Sect.

Chapter 388: Returning to Yuling Sect ()

Chapter 388: Returning to Yuling Sect

In the Grand Hall of Yuling Sect, Leng Hongcai and numerous elders awaited Luo Tian’s return.

“Sect Leader, this mission was entirely undertaken by Yuling Sect disciples without any elder leading them. There shouldn’t be much change, right?” One elder spoke up.

“Rest assured, Luo Tian’s strength and experience are no worse than any elder. There shouldn’t be much trouble,” Leng Hongcai replied calmly, though his expression carried a hint of concern.

The Tianshi Sect’s strength was ever-changing. Though they had received information from a senior, Leng Hongcai still worried about any unexpected developments. He would not have sent Luo Tian and Qiu Chouyan on this risk unless he wanted to solidify Luo Tian’s position as junior sect leader.

“Roar…” The dragon’s roar echoed, causing Leng Hongcai and the elders to briefly display a hint of joy.

“They’ve returned!”

“They’ve returned! Let’s go out and greet them. This is a great achievement for Yuling Sect!” Leng Hongcai smiled as he stepped out of the Grand Hall.

“Roar…” The dragon circled Yuling Sect once before landing slowly after the disciples activated the protective array.

Under Leng Hongcai and the elders’ and onlookers’ gazes, the dragon landed. Luo Tian, Qiu Chouyan, and others appeared.

The four hundred disciples bore traces of blood qi; some were wounded, their robes stained with blood. Yet they all gazed at Luo Tian with admiration.

Luo Tian stood on the dragon’s back, having restored his cultivation via pills during the return journey. The injured Yuling Sect disciples were all treated with pills by Luo Tian, except for a few who remained pale-faced.

Seeing Leng Hongcai and the elders waiting there, Luo Tian’s gaze momentarily tightened, a smile forming on his face. He and Qiu Chouyan bowed respectfully to Leng Hongcai.

“Four hundred people?” Leng Hongcai and the elders glanced at the group returning only with four hundred, their brows furrowing slightly.

“Disciple Luo Tian respectfully greets the Sect Leader and all elders!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, his voice respectful.

“Haha, Uncle Leng, I must say this time it was all thanks to Luo Tian. Let me tell you what happened…” Zheng Xin didn’t care about the details, boldly stepping forward to recount the battle against Tianshi Sect.

Though Zheng Xin’s account was lengthy, Leng Hongcai and the elders had no choice but to listen. After about an hour of storytelling, Zheng Xin finally concluded the events.

Hearing that Yang Huanyu had escaped and how formidable Tianshi Sect was, the elders’ faces shifted slightly.

The thirteen elders cast their gazes toward Luo Tian’s group, observing the remaining four hundred Yuling Sect disciples. Their survival proved they were true elites of Yuling Sect.

“Where is Lianlesheng?” At this moment, a trembling voice echoed out. An elder of the initial stage of Spirit-Calling had a pale face, scanning Luo Tian’s group before his expression turned fierce.

“Lianlesheng? Who is that?” Luo Tian asked in confusion.

“He’s my grandson!” The elder of the initial stage of Spirit-Calling replied, his eyes fixated on Luo Tian.

Luo Tian instantly understood—his group had no trace of the elder’s grandson, meaning he had died in the chaos. Luo Tian knew the elder must be heartbroken but couldn’t help himself; he hadn’t had time to care for others.

“Elder, I’m sorry for your loss. If there was any chance to save him, we did our best. I apologize for not considering your grandson!” Luo Tian felt the elder’s sorrow and comforted him.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the crowd behind him again showed admiration. Everyone present clearly saw what had transpired; without Luo Tian, the remaining number would have been far less than four hundred.

“Not considering him? A fine excuse!”

“Hmph! Luo Tian, I now suspect you’ve colluded with the Tianshi Sect and deliberately let Yang Huanyu escape! Do you know your crime?” The elder of Spirit-Calling spoke with indignation.

Hearing the elder’s words, Luo Tian was stunned. He had intended to comfort this old man but instead found himself accused.

Before Luo Tian could speak, Zheng Xin stepped forward and couldn’t bear it: “This elder, we understand your grief over losing your grandson. But you can’t blame others for it! Everyone present knows the situation at that time. If not for Luo Tian, I believe these people would have lost half of them in the Tai’an Mountains!”

“Exactly! His grandson was weaker than others, and he died. But you blame others!”
“Shameful! You’re still an elder of Yuling Sect, yet you act so shamelessly!” Zheng Xin’s words sparked murmurs from Luo Tian’s group, their faces filled with disdain toward the elder.

Luo Tian’s face darkened; he sensed a hint of conspiracy here. His gaze shifted toward Leng Hongcai.

Leng Hongcai also blinked, glancing at the elder of Spirit-Calling before speaking softly: “Elder Lian, I suppose you’re still grieving. Your beloved grandson’s death is heartbreaking for all of us. But in battle, life and death are uncertain—please accept my condolences.”

“Sect Leader, I now formally accuse Luo Tian of colluding with the Tianshi Sect and deliberately letting their sect leader escape!” The elder of Spirit-Calling spoke solemnly, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness as he surveyed the other elders. Seeing none of them intervened, their expressions suggesting they were watching the situation unfold, he quietly steadied his mind.

Luo Tian knew if these Spirit-Calling elders all sided with the accuser, it would be problematic. But one elder alone, he believed Leng Hongcai could handle it easily.

“Elder Lian, this accusation is indeed baseless,” Leng Hongcai’s face showed impatience.

“Sect Leader, according to Yuling Sect’s rules, if an elder accuses a disciple, that disciple must be detained first, right?” The elder of Spirit-Calling smirked, looking at Leng Hongcai.

Hearing this, Leng Hongcai was taken aback. He suddenly recalled that elders did have this privilege. However, based on his understanding of Luo Tian, the boy was usually tolerant but would not back down when pushed to his limits. When he reached that point, he would definitely retaliate fiercely.

“Elder Lian, there is indeed such a rule,” Leng Hongcai’s face showed hesitation. He was about to continue when—

“Then it’s good!” The elder didn’t let Leng Hongcai finish, his qi surged into a massive hand that grabbed toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 389: Who Will Protect You ()

Chapter 389: Who Will Protect You

The qi hand fiercely grabbed toward Luo Tian. No one had expected this move from Elder Lian, not even Leng Hongcai, who was momentarily stunned. He moved to intercept but found himself blocked by the surrounding elders.

“You! Are you rebelling?” Leng Hongcai glared at these dozen elders, shouting angrily.

“Sect Leader, Yuling Sect’s rules are indeed like this!” One elder smiled and spoke.

The moment the elder’s words fell, others nodded in agreement. They knew deep down this had little to do with Luo Tian, but since his arrival, the junior sect leader position had easily fallen into his hands. This deprived their children of opportunities, making them deeply discontented.

If they could eliminate Luo Tian now, their children would again have a chance to become Sect Leader. This was what they desired most. Moreover, they were merely blocking Leng Hongcai—let Elder Lian take the blame. If things escalated, they would only be confined for a few days at most.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness as he gazed at the qi hand approaching him. A terrifying pressure instantly overwhelmed his mind.

At this moment, Luo Tian was merely at the peak of Bone-Devouring but still far behind Spirit-Calling. “All below Spirit-Calling are mere ants,” this was no empty claim.

Qiu Chouyan and Zheng Xin watched the qi hand, realizing that a Spirit-Calling elder’s single strike was no less powerful than an advanced-level martial art. Though it was comparable to an advanced-level technique, the pressure within that hand made even a peak Bone-Devouring strength hesitate to fight back.

Qiu Chouyan and Zheng Xin’s faces showed anxiety, watching Luo Tian with concern.

Others cursed the elder while also showing worry. Even Dongbo Yongsi and other elders’ descendants felt guilty seeing their elders block Leng Hongcai.

“Block it!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness as his qi surged, the liquid droplets in his dantian pouring out like water. His five bones glowed faintly.

The qi hand instantly arrived, slamming onto Luo Tian’s arm.

“Crack… Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed from Luo Tian’s arm, and he felt his bone had already developed tiny cracks. If the power were slightly stronger, this arm would be ruined. Bone fractures weren’t easy to endure.

Even so, Luo Tian’s body kept retreating backward, leaving two deep grooves under his feet.

After ten zhangs, Luo Tian collided with the dragon seated there. The dragon let out a painful cry and, with its mountain-like body, was dragged several zhangs before stopping.

“Luo Tian!” Qiu Chouyan and Zheng Xin rushed to his side, gently supporting him up.

Seeing Luo Tian injured but having blocked the Spirit-Calling elder’s attack, everyone stared at him in disbelief.

Luo Tian was in poor condition; his entire arm felt like it wasn’t his own. His upper body’s clothes were nearly gone, revealing his well-built torso. His body was covered with countless wounds from the qi’s slicing.

“Good! If you’re sensible, surrender quietly! Can you block a second strike?” The elder sneered.

“Elder Lian, don’t push too hard!” Leng Hongcai glared at the elder with coldness, shouting. His aura surged toward the dozen elders surrounding him.

Leng Hongcai was furious at these elders’ increasing audacity. This behavior clearly showed no respect for him.

Luo Tian gazed at Elder Lian’s contemptuous eyes, a faint smile on his face. This gaze ignited Luo Tian’s stubbornness. He knew if he truly submitted and let Elder Lian capture him, he would become a soft target for them to trample.

“If I say no?” Luo Tian’s face showed determination, his voice slowly coming from the blood-stained corner of his mouth.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Yuling Sect disciples who had participated in the battle against the Tianshi Sect all trembled. Their faces showed fervor toward Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian’s status among them was fully established—few had the courage to defy a Spirit-Calling elder.

“Boom…” Elder Lian seemed provoked, his qi hand reformed and rushed toward Luo Tian who had just stood up.

“Disgraceful!” As the qi hand formed, all Yuling Sect disciples muttered in anger, their faces filled with fury toward Elder Lian.

But their gazes couldn’t stop the qi hand’s advance. Golden hands formed and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with hatred. A drop of blood slowly flowed out; he knew only by merging his blood could he have a chance to block it. Otherwise, this strike would leave him with an unmeasurable injury or even affect his future cultivation.

“Don’t hurt my brother!” Just as Luo Tian was about to absorb the blood, a childish voice echoed from the crowd. A small figure rushed forward like lightning toward the qi hand.

“Long Baobao, get out of the way!” Luo Tian heard the voice and immediately roared.

“Boom…” A thunderous explosion struck Long Baobao’s small body, sending him far away and stopping in front of Luo Tian.

“Is this Long Baobao?” People stared at him with shock. Though Long Baobao had shown ferocity during the battle against the Tianshi Sect, no one could have imagined this small creature would dare to block a Spirit-Calling attack.

“Brother… brother… it hurts…” Long Baobao’s small face showed委屈, his lips bleeding. His appearance evoked pity.

“Haha, someone can block the first strike. Who will protect you for the second?” Elder Lian glanced at Long Baobao, then smiled.

“I will protect him!” Qiu Chouyan’s eyes were cold as she gazed at Elder Lian.

“I will protect him too!” Zheng Xin’s voice followed, his expression now serious.

“Me too… I’ll protect Luo Tian…” As Qiu Chouyan and Zheng Xin stood up, more people gradually emerged from the crowd. Their faces showed determination as they gazed at Elder Lian.

Chapter 390: Luo Tian’s Ultimate Fury ()

Chapter 390: Luo Tian’s Ultimate Fury

One by one, figures stood before Luo Tian, radiating Bone-Devouring strength. This aura surged skyward, pressing toward Elder Lian.

Elder Lian was stunned, a faint smile on his face: “You think these Bone-Devouring disciples can block me? The dignity of Spirit-Calling is beyond your reach!”

Dongbo Yongsi, Chen Yuhe, and Fang Junming’s faces showed hesitation as they slowly stepped before Qiu Chouyan.

“Yongsi! Foolishness, get down!” A white-haired elder shouted angrily.

At the same time, the elders blocking Leng Hongcai all cried out, urging their descendants to step back.

“Grandfather! Luo Tian has done us a favor. If not for him, we wouldn’t have returned with so many disciples!” Dongbo Yongsi’s face showed determination; his feet didn’t move.

“Haha, these young ones know good from bad better than you old fools! You’ve lived too long in vain!” Leng Hongcai saw the four hundred people standing before Luo Tian, his face showing relief.

“Though it’s touching, it’s useless. I’ve decided to capture this boy today!” Elder Lian’s face showed hesitation, but seeing his grandson had died, he still resented Luo Tian for not saving him.

The qi hand slowly gathered again, this time infused with Elder Lian’s anger and half his strength. Compared to the previous one, it was ten times stronger.

Everyone’s gazes trembled toward the sky’s qi hand; some even shook their legs, but their eyes remained resolute. Their feet didn’t move.

The qi hand slowly pressed toward them, and Elder Lian’s face showed mockery.

“Boom…” Just as everyone looked desperate, a towering aura suddenly rose from the crowd’s back. A crimson killing intent scattered their figures, revealing Luo Tian and Long Baobao.

“Luo Tian!” People stared at him in disbelief.

At this moment, Long Baobao’s eyes were closed, his lips’ blood already dried. His faint breaths came from his small nose, as if he were sleeping.

Luo Tian’s eyes were crimson, his gaze fixed on Elder Lian. His body was surrounded by blood-red qi.

Luo Tian’s heart was filled with hatred; a strong killing intent surged from his soul. His inner realm’s book of chronicles slowly opened again, emitting a crimson qi.

“Kill him!” Luo Tian’s mind kept repeating this voice. His inner realm’s book of chronicles, stimulated by his hatred, opened its final page, emitting a crimson qi.

“Kill him! Kill him!” Luo Tian murmured, his body like wind as he rushed through the crowd. His legs slammed onto the ground, creating two deep footprints. His body was like an arrow, soaring into the sky.

Luo Tian’s figure instantly appeared beside the golden qi hand in the sky, radiating an overwhelming aura. His fist’s qi surged forth. The crowd was stunned as he launched a punch.

“What’s wrong with Luo Tian?” People stared in disbelief, sensing his current state was abnormal.

“He’s been corrupted by hatred! Where did Luo Tian get such intense killing intent!” Zheng Xin showed concern, watching Luo Tian who had reached the qi hand.

“Boom…” Without hesitation, Luo Tian punched the qi hand.

The thunderous sound echoed; people felt their eardrums vibrate. The entire Yuling Mountain seemed to tremble three times. Under everyone’s stunned gazes, the qi hand exploded and dissipated into the air.

“This…!” Elder Lian was completely stunned, his face showing intense disbelief. He was a Spirit-Calling elder; even half his strength had been shattered by this Bone-Devouring peak boy.

Leng Hongcai and the other elders also showed amazement. They clearly felt the figure rushing toward the sky, its aura no less than a Spirit-Calling initial stage. Perhaps even stronger than most.

“What’s in his body? Why does this aura make me feel pressure!” One Spirit-Calling middle-stage elder showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian who had landed.

Luo Tian’s body was surrounded by blood qi, like a demon from hell. He slowly walked toward Elder Lian.

His body had fine cracks, but he still maintained a sliver of clarity. Yet his only thought was to kill Elder Lian and avenge Long Baobao.

“Crack…” The ground beneath Luo Tian’s feet cracked again. His body, like a rainbow, instantly appeared before Elder Lian. He seemed to have forgotten his martial arts and launched another punch.

Elder Lian no longer underestimated Luo Tian; a hint of regret surfaced in his heart. But as a Spirit-Calling elder and an elder of Yuling Sect, if he retreated now, he would never be able to hold his head high again.

A golden fist suddenly rose, forming a long dragon that rushed toward Luo Tian’s fist.

The thunderous sound echoed endlessly between the two, and an invisible wave of energy spread from their front. Cold Qiu Chouyan and others were pushed back.

Luo Tian, however, seemed unaware of this. He kept punching relentlessly. This time, his fists combined gray qi and crimson energy, each containing the power of destruction.

Elder Lian was no fool; he could withstand Luo Tian’s punches, but his heart felt bitter.

Each punch took away his vitality—though not much, he had already taken five punches, losing 150 years of vitality.

150 years for a Spirit-Calling elder was no small loss, but Luo Tian’s attacks never ceased. If this continued, Elder Lian would definitely be overwhelmed.

Chapter 391: Bow and Arrow to Shoot a Spirit-Calling ()

Chapter 391: Bow and Arrow to Shoot a Spirit-Calling

The thunderous sound echoed endlessly between Luo Tian and Elder Lian. Luo Tian, seemingly tireless, continued to punch in the crowd’s stunned gaze. His body’s qi seemed to be limitless, never consuming a single drop.

Elder Lian’s face showed exhaustion; his green robe was torn and ragged, with countless tiny wounds on his body.

These injuries were nothing to Elder Lian; the qi consumption was also trivial. Once in Spirit-Calling, qi was no longer an issue—naturally flowing into his body from the world. Spirit-Calling elders could also connect with worldly qi, using it for themselves.

But what troubled Elder Lian was the continuous loss of vitality. He had already lost nearly 500 years’ worth of vitality—500 years was enough to cause damage for a Spirit-Calling elder.

Elder Lian knew he would be exhausted if this continued. Originally, he had planned to exhaust Luo Tian by using qi deficiency. But seeing Luo Tian’s relentless punches without fatigue, he abandoned this plan.

“Buzz…” After blocking another punch, Elder Lian’s back emitted a surge of qi. Two golden wings slowly unfolded, and he used the punch’s force to retreat swiftly, his wings flapping into the sky.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed as Elder Lian’s chest bore a clear punch mark, his body appearing in the sky.

“Elder Lian has retreated!” One elder’s face showed shock, gazing at Elder Lian flying into the sky.

“With Bone-Devouring peak strength, he used special means to repel a Spirit-Calling initial stage. What an extraordinary talent! This boy’s achievements will spread throughout Yuling Sect within two days, and he’ll surely become renowned in the Eastern Region!”

“His achievements today will be unforgettable among these people!” Several Spirit-Calling elders showed intense disbelief, exclaiming.

As Spirit-Calling elders themselves, they could not fathom how a Bone-Devouring peak Luo Tian had managed to repel Elder Lian.

“Luo Tian!” The disciples around him gazed at the blood-red Luo Tian with fervor. His achievements today had left an indelible mark in their hearts.
