“Good!” Xiao Qian's face bore a smile as he waved his hand, transforming the purple flower into a butterfly that circled around him with ethereal grace.

“Truly obedient!” Fu Xingxuan's face softened with a smile, patting Xiao Qian’s head without departing.

“Alas, beauty must be a tool of influence,” Fu Xingyue mused, her eyes glinting with amusement.

Fan Jingyu and Jin Ziyang’s faces darkened. They had not anticipated Fu Xingxuan subduing Xiao Qian with a single flower. Though "Butterfly Love Flower" was rare in the Starmoon Divine Clan, it paled in value compared to what they had sacrificed—less than one percent of their cost.

“I knew that already,” Luo Tian sighed, recalling Fu Xingxuan’s legendary popularity in the Starmoon Divine Clan and his own wanted status.

“I have butterflies too!” Ban Hun bellowed, waving his hand to conjure a purple butterfly that fluttered before Xiao Qian.

“Don’t! You’re ugly and lack fragrance!” Xiao Qian rejected outright.

“What about this?” Tu Feiyang refused to yield, flicking his finger to release a drop of blood that transformed into a crimson butterfly.

“Sacrificing so much!” Luo Tian and the others marveled, noting Tu Feiyang’s pallid face.

“No!” Xiao Qian sneered, ignoring it entirely.

“You…” Tu Feiyang and Ban Hun’s faces darkened; even their blood had been spurned.

“You’re next,” Jin Ziyang turned his gaze to Luo Tian, indifferent toward others. If Luo Tian was delayed, Jin Ziyang was confident he could defeat the rest and secure greater odds of claiming the Soul-Subduing Tower.

“Why rush?” Fu Xingyue adjusted her robes, approaching Xiao Qian before summoning a wooden horse. The group snickered.

“What is this? Just a toy!” Tu Feiyang scoffed, dismissing it as a mundane child’s plaything.

“But what is this?” Xiao Qian furrowed his brow, examining the wooden horse before murmuring.

Xiao Qian leapt onto the wooden horse’s body, which emitted a resonant hum and began to move.

“Haha! You’ve passed!” Xiao Qian’s eyes sparkled with delight, unused to such wonders after years of solitude among plants.

“Truly skilled!” Fu Xingyue admired Luo Tian, unaware that this toy was the very one he had gifted her.

“Xiao Qian, look!” Fu Xingyang’s eyes lit up as he presented a wooden puppet that shifted forms. Another mundane toy.

“You’ve passed too!” Xiao Qian’s face bore fascination as he played with the puppet.

“This also works?” Tu Feiyang and Ban Hun cursed, watching Xiao Qian revel in the toys.

“No choice but to admit beauty is a tool,” Fu Xingyue smirked at them.

“I have these too!” Tu Feiyang and Ban Hun roared, summoning countless human toys with their might.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian scoffed, smirking as he watched the toys materialize.

“Boom!” Xiao Qian was instantly drawn to a wooden horse, but it shattered beneath him, sending him tumbling.

“Too easy?” Luo Tian smirked inwardly. The items he gifted Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingyang were not common toys but artifacts crafted by a rare sect of the Nine Realms. Originally given to the Five Elements Sect when Luo Li was young, they had been taken by Xiaoqi as playthings.

“You’re liars! Grandpa, they’re really annoying!” Xiao Qian’s face bore委屈 as he addressed the spectral figure above.

“Understood, Grandpa,” the Soul-Subduing Tower’s spirit smiled, nodding. Its gaze swept over Tu Feiyang and Ban Hun, causing them to shudder instinctively.

“You’re next. Hurry,” the spirit said impatiently to Luo Tian.

“If Luo Tian fails, the relic of Master of the Endless Sky will be mine!” Jin Ziyang’s face tensed, watching Luo Tian with hope.

As the group watched, Luo Tian approached Xiao Qian calmly, smiling without revealing anything. He merely waved his hands, sending waves of energy into the air.

“Good,” Jin Ziyang sighed in relief, smiling at Luo Tian. To him, this soul-tree with childlike intellect was easily swayed by novelty.

“Hum…” As the group watched, Luo Tian pointed his finger, releasing a cascade of white runes that enveloped Xiao Qian.

“What is this?” Xiao Qian’s eyes widened, sensing an inexplicable familiarity with the runes.

Luo Tian smiled, clasping his hands to absorb the runes into Xiao Qian’s body.

“Hum…” A resonant hum echoed within Xiao Qian, his face displaying pleasure.

“Crack…” As Tu Feiyang and the others watched, Xiao Qian’s tiny body emitted a series of cracks before halting.

“Grew a bit?” Tu Feiyang rubbed his eyes, staring at Xiao Qian’s醉态.

Chapter 1506: The Trial Begins

“It’s the Art of Nurturing Life!” Fu Xingxuan smiled, recognizing Luo Tian’s method.

“I recall! The Art of Nurturing Life promotes growth in flora! Immortal Herb is also a rare herb!” Fu Xingyue added.

“Have I passed?” Luo Tian exhaled, gazing at Xiao Qian with a smile.

“I want to grow! Quickly!” Xiao Qian jumped, yearning for Luo Tian.

“I need rest. You can follow me daily, growing each day,” Luo Tian smiled, his experience with children evident—having raised Longbao, Luo Xiting, Luo Li, and Xiaoqi.

“Shameless! Don’t agree!” Tu Feiyang cursed, watching Luo Tian’s blatant temptation.

“No! I have a sister. I can’t go with you!” Xiao Qian shook his head, though growth tempted him, he clung to something dearer.

“Sister?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, puzzled by Xiao Qian’s mention.

Luo Tian pressed his palm to his forehead, releasing a flame mark that manifested Xiaoqi in her seven-colored braid.

“Not only will you grow, but you’ll have a playmate!” Luo Tian persisted, summoning Xiaoqi to sway Xiao Qian.

“Ah…” Xiaoqi appeared and spotted Xiao Qian, their heights nearly equal. Curious eyes examined the soul-tree in humanoid form.

“Ah…” Xiao Qian’s eyes lit up, eager for a companion—his first peer in this realm.

“Go play!” Luo Tian urged Xiaoqi, who rarely met peers her age.

“Hum…” A hum resonated through Luo Tian’s hair as a girl with a stuffed doll materialized—Shi Hun Can, the soul-eating silkworm transformed.

No longer a dirty child, she had become an enchanting girl radiating terrifying power.

“Go! Both of you!” Luo Tian smiled, hoping Xiaoqi and Shi Hun Can would lure Xiao Qian.

“Hmm!” The three children gathered, excitedly fiddling with the previous toys.

“I’ll take you to meet my sister. She’s very kind!” Xiao Qian led Xiaoqi and Shi Hun Can into the Soul-Subduing Tower.

“Sister?” Luo Tian’s eyes held anticipation, wondering if Xiao Qian’s sister was who he suspected.

“Alright, your trials begin!” The gray spirit smiled, watching the three vanish into the tower.

“Give us another chance!” Tu Feiyang and Ban Hun roared, realizing only they had failed.

“Is my luck over?” Tu Feiyang glared at Luo Tian, feeling cursed whenever he met him.

“Enter! Your trial is to reach the ninth level and find the ancestral mark left by the master. The one who claims and refines it shall be my new master!” The spirit addressed Luo Tian’s group.

“Old friend, would you like to visit my quarters?” The tower spirit smiled, inviting the Starmoon Divine Spear’s spirit.

“I’m busy!” The spear’s spirit snorted, declining entry and fleeing into the Starmoon Divine Spear, returning to Fu Xingxuan’s ring.

“I’ll wait at the ninth level! Strive, for someone has already entered ahead of you and reached the seventh!” The spirit addressed Luo Tian’s group before vanishing.

Luo Tian’s group exchanged glances, then soared toward the gray gate.

“Hum…” As they entered, waves enveloped them, and their figures vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Boom…” Luo Tian landed on the ground, his eyes narrowing as he surveyed the surroundings.

“Kill!” A wave of fierce killing intent surged, startling Luo Tian.

His cultivation also shifted to the Sage Stage, shocking him.

“Brother, fight! Humanity has a chance!” A muscular man, bloodied and frenzied, shouted.

“Yes! Fight!” Frenzied voices echoed, igniting Luo Tian’s spirit.

“Roar…” Beasts roared across the world, pressuring faces to tremble.

Suddenly, fragments flooded Luo Tian’s mind, filling him with exhilaration.

“This is the Ancient Era battlefield!” Luo Tian smiled, realizing he had entered a realm akin to the ancient仙古大陆. He now embodied an Ancient Era figure.

“Qiu Tianchi!” Luo Tian’s mind jolted, recalling his name, pondering where he’d heard it.

“Returning to the Ancient Era?” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at his bloodied self, eyes gleaming coldly. He knew he must fight—death wouldn’t suffice for the trial.

He observed the battlefield instead of rushing into battle, aware he was now in the Ancient Era’s Sage Stage. Even Sage Stage masters were lowly here, and Sage Stage peaks were insignificant compared to the era’s power.

Hearing his companions call him “Lieutenant,” he understood Sage Stage was common here.

“Humans,卑微 humans! My clan’s slaves, who gave you courage to rebel?” A deep voice echoed.

Numerous green figures stood opposite the humans, coldly charging.

This was a battle; Luo Tian had faced many wars but never seen such low-level Sage Stage combat.

“Will Master of the Endless Sky appear?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with anticipation, imagining the ultimate being sweeping through the Ancient Era.

He then fully grasped his current identity and situation.

This era was humanity’s first attempt to break free from the myriad clans. These people were among the first to escape their enslavement.

The green-clad foes were the麒麟 Clan, a weaker branch of the Ancient Era’s clans.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed, admiration mixed with sorrow. Though humanity had prepared long, their strength still lagged.

The battlefield was tense but human forces were losing. Big-power masters were evenly matched, though this was just a battlefield corner with one initial-stage Master.

“Fight!” Luo Tian glared at his companions, charging toward the麒麟 Clan’s masters.

Though his cultivation had dropped, his eyes and combat experience remained. Even with Sage Stage peers, he felt no fear. His companions were formidable, battle-tested.

“Enter the Demon Realm!” Luo Tian hesitated not, activating his demon state. His cultivation surged to near Sage Stage Midpoint.

“Lieutenant?” His companions were puzzled, stunned by his transformation. They’d never seen him use such a technique.

Masses fell, the battlefield chaotic. Soon, Luo Tian and his ten men pushed through corpses to the front, clashing with the formidable麒麟 Clan masters.

A black demon sword materialized, slicing through a master’s body with a resounding “Plop!”

“Lieutenant, when did you become so strong?” His ten men marveled at his one-slice victory.

“Follow me!” Luo Tian roared, brandishing the black sword as a demon god, charging into the endless麒麟 Clan.

“Fight!” Others faced similar shocks, rushing into the Ancient Era clans.

Chapter 1507: Escape Beyond the Domain

The battlefield turned into a meat grinder, bloodstained earth. Luo Tian and his ten men pierced the麒麟 Clan’s ranks like a blade.

“Why?” As time passed, the eleven men caught the clan’s attention—too fast to be stopped.

“Haha! Thrilling!” Luo Tian led the charge, others following as they冲锋 into the麒麟 Clan.

“Boom…” Bloodied and cold-eyed, Luo Tian resembled a demon from hell.

“Eliminate the leader!” A Master Stage’s voice echoed, preventing humanity’s escape.

Two Sage Stage Midpoint麒麟 Clan masters appeared before Luo Tian, coldly eyeing him.

“Humanity has a fine talent!” The two young masters sneered, charging at Luo Tian.

“Sealing Demon Realm!” Facing a Master Stage opponent, Luo Tian was unafraid. Black runes enveloped his fist, amplified by the “Buddha’s Attack” and “One Strike to Defeat All” techniques, striking one of the masters.

“Die!” The master’s face turned cold, attacking with a punch.

“Crack…” Their collision sent surrounding combatants flying.

The master’s face paled, stunned by the injury from a Sage Stage Initial.

“Qilin Stomp!” The other master transformed into a massive Qilin, stomping down on Luo Tian.

“Severing Heaven’s Seal!” Luo Tian waved his hands, a black vortex forming above the battlefield. It spun violently, releasing a storm that crushed the Qilin.

Though his cultivation had dropped, Severing Heaven’s Seal was formidable, and with two techniques加持, Luo Tian confident this strike could kill any Sage Stage Midpoint.

“Boom…” The Qilin’s body exploded into blood mist, scattering across the ground.

“Die!” Luo Tian pointed, unleashing divine power over the blood mist.

“Roar…” A roar echoed in the green blood, losing its divine essence and vanishing.

“Go!” Luo Tian repelled one, killed another, no hesitation as he shouted to his ten men. He knew their plan—escape as far as possible, reaching the outer domain’s human-reborn continent, Jingtian.

Others were irrelevant; he knew this was an illusion, possibly a trial from the Soul-Subduing Tower.

The slaughter continued; Luo Tian’s momentum was unstoppable, bloodied and wounded, but his flesh wasn’t as strong as his reincarnation body.

Yet the Qilin Clan trembled at his might—Sage Stage Initials couldn’t withstand one punch. Even Sage Stage Midpoint masters were either repelled or killed by his martial arts.

“Thousand zhang… ten thousand zhang…” Luo Tian pushed forward, grateful he hadn’t met a Sage Stage Late master.

But his numbers dwindled; five remained from the original ten.

“Lieutenant!” The five men, watching their leader transform into a different person, felt gratitude. Without Luo Tian’s lead, they’d have been crushed by the Qilin Clan.

Time passed; Luo Tian’s body was bloodied, with several fatal wounds.

“Hold on!” Luo Tian roared internally. Though he didn’t know if dying here meant real death, he knew it was a trial—death might cost him the Soul-Subduing Tower.

The green sky grew closer; reaching beyond it meant near success.

“Excellent humanity! I never expected such a talent to emerge,” a mocking voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. A figure in martial attire appeared, radiating terrifying power.

“Qilin Clan’s prodigy, Qi Tiansheng!” The group behind Luo Tian felt despair.

“Sage Stage Late!” Luo Tian’s heart jolted—had he truly met a Sage Stage Midpoint master?

“This trial is too damned hard!” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the green sky before gripping his black demon sword.

“Dare you resist?” Qi Tiansheng sneered, summoning a green hand to crush Luo Tian.

Seeing Qi Tiansheng attack, the Qilin Clan’s men cheered, parting to let him kill this thorn.

“Seventh Strike!” Luo Tian roared, his black sword cleaving the descending hand.

“Boom…” Their collision sent shockwaves across the battlefield, invisible waves spreading outward.

Luo Tian’s body, already wounded, was sent flying, spitting blood, anger in his eyes. If he were at full strength, this Sage Stage Late master would be crushed by a single breath. Now, he was bloodied from one strike.

“Hmph!” Qi Tiansheng’s face showed surprise, impressed by Luo Tian’s resilience.

“Severing Heaven’s Seal!” As he retreated, Luo Tian waved his hands, spitting blood as a golden vortex followed. When he stopped, the black seal descended on Qi Tiansheng.

“Underestimated you! A slave possesses such techniques. You must have planned this!” Qi Tiansheng’s eyes gleamed, acknowledging Luo Tian’s sword and seal as formidable martial arts. If he obtained them, his combat power would skyrocket.

“Capture alive!” Qi Tiansheng smiled, summoning a green Qilin from his hands to charge the seal.

Their collision erupted in explosions, shaking the battlefield.

“Go!” Luo Tian knew he couldn’t match Qi Tiansheng now. Unless he reached Sage Stage Midpoint, Qi Tiansheng—Qilin Clan’s prodigy—would be his end. He had already survived two strikes, a miracle. Continuing would mean death.

“Bitter God’s Seven Stomps, Shattering Eternity!” Luo Tian unleashed his strongest strike, his black foot adorned with runes, wielding two supreme techniques toward Qi Tiansheng.

The sky darkened; the black foot radiated overwhelming power, even making Qi Tiansheng’s face change.

“Qilin Roar Shattering the Heavens!” Qi Tiansheng dared not underestimate, feeling immense pressure from Luo Tian’s foot.

“Roar…” The green Qilin materialized, its roar unleashing devastating power.

“幽冥鬼步!” Luo Tian didn’t linger, his seventh step making him vanish like a ghost, maximizing speed toward the outer domain.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian moved, his black foot collided with Qi Tiansheng’s energy.

A terrifying explosion erupted, wild waves shaking everyone’s faces in disbelief.

The wild waves propelled Luo Tian faster, instantly breaking through the domain.

“Damn it!” Qi Tiansheng’s face darkened as Luo Tian escaped his grasp, chasing him into the outer domain.

“Escaped!” The domain’s Luo Tian felt excitement but remained cautious, navigating by this body’s memories toward Jingtian Continent.

“Dare you run from me so easily?” Luo Tian had just moved when Qi Tiansheng’s figure burst into the outer domain, coldly speaking.

Chapter 1508: Passing the First Level

“Damn it, your speed is too fast!” Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly, surprised Qi Tiansheng was so swift.

“Your speed is good, but you don’t know I am the Wind Qilin of the Qilin Clan!” Qi Tiansheng sneered, transforming into a green light to crush Luo Tian.

“If I were at peak strength, killing you would be like crushing an ant. What’s the point of showing off?” Luo Tian was enraged, his hands forming black runes.

“Manifesting the World!” Luo Tian’s deep roar echoed as black runes merged into his body, causing him to grow rapidly.

“Ten zhang… hundred zhang…” Qi Tiansheng’s eyes widened as Luo Tian expanded to nearly fifty zhang, his black qi swirling like a true demon.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s cold face showed determination, his massive hand swinging to crush Qi Tiansheng.

“Roar…” Qi Tiansheng, sensing Luo Tian’s power, roared and transformed into his Qilin form. Though only twenty zhang tall, he was still tiny compared to Luo Tian.

The monstrous maw roared skyward, colliding with Luo Tian’s hand.

“Boom…” The two titans collided, collapsing the stars. Qi Tiansheng was sent flying, spitting green blood, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“Bitter God’s Wrath, Trampling the Heavens!” Luo Tian roared, his foot stepping again, trampling stars toward Qi Tiansheng.

“Go!” Qi Tiansheng’s cold voice echoed as he spat endless green light, forming a sword to slash Luo Tian’s foot.

“Plop…” The green blade sliced through Luo Tian’s foot, golden blood spewing, revealing white bones in the stars.

“Again!” Luo Tian stepped again, his second and third steps of Bitter God’s Seven Stomps, as if unharmed, clashing with Qi Tiansheng.

Qi Tiansheng roared endlessly, his mind in turmoil—how could a human, so lowly, fight him to this extent?

“Why do you know Bitter God’s Seven Stomps?” Qi Tiansheng was puzzled, unable to fathom why Luo Tian knew the clan’s forbidden art.

The two clashed in space, each collision sending Luo Tian spitting blood but like a relentless monster.

Luo Tian didn’t know Qi Tiansheng was the Qilin Clan’s prodigy, who had once challenged Master of the Endless Sky and was crushed by his palm.

The booming sounds echoed in space, Luo Tian’s confidence waning. His current state was dire; though his body was reinforced by Manifesting the World, he was still far below Qi Tiansheng. Without his combat experience, he’d have died many times.

“What to do?” Luo Tian’s eyes glinted with calculation. He couldn’t abandon this trial—Master of the Endless Sky’s relic was too powerful. If he gave up, he’d regret it forever.

“This is just the first level? So hard?” Luo Tian muttered, surprised by the difficulty upon entering the Soul-Subduing Tower.

“I see what you’re doing!” Qi Tiansheng, bloodied and fierce, believed this human prodigy was near exhaustion.

“Have I seen such storms?” Luo Tian roared, clashing again with Qi Tiansheng. His massive body collapsed a star, his hands moving swiftly.

“Try it!” Luo Tian thought, the only plan was to use another forbidden art from Gu Tian’s—Buddha’s Attack evolved into the relic.

But he’d never tried it, unsure of success. If successful, he was confident in defeating Qi Tiansheng.

“Hum…” A hum resonated from Luo Tian’s hands, golden light emerging. Golden palace shadows formed within the light, radiating overwhelming power that made Luo Tian’s face brighten.

“Chance!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, but he felt strained—his current Sage Stage Initial was too weak to sustain the relic. Plus, this was his first use of Buddha’s Attack, making it awkward.

“Destroy him!” Qi Tiansheng’s eyes widened, sensing the golden palace’s threat. If completed, it could kill him—its pressure was too great.

“Roar…” The Qilin’s massive form charged at Luo Tian, no tricks, stomping down.

“Make it work!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned wild, his body shrinking back to normal size, even looking gaunt.

“Haha! Humanity has such a talent! You must survive!” As Luo Tian neared exhaustion, a loud laugh echoed. Space trembled as an exhausted old man emerged from the void, blood trickling from his mouth but smiling.

“Zhang Jingfu! You dare rebel against our Qilin Clan? You’re seeking death!” The old man’s appearance summoned two cold-faced elders from the void, their aura indicating Master Stage Initial.

“Boom…” As the two elders appeared, Luo Tian’s ancient palace shattered, releasing waves of destruction that swept through space.

“Child, what is your name? Don’t fear!” The exhausted old man appeared before Luo Tian, striking Qi Tiansheng with a punch.

“Roar…” Qi Tiansheng halted abruptly, unable to withstand a Master Stage Initial.

Though unwilling to fight the old man, Qi Tiansheng’s punch was met by a golden fist.

Two cold sneers echoed as the two elders appeared before Qi Tiansheng, one deflecting Zhang Jingfu’s punch.

“Dare to betray our Qilin Clan, you seek death!” The elder glared at Zhang Jingfu and Luo Tian.

“Child, no matter who you are, your escape makes you our hope. I pray you survive!” Zhang Jingfu ignored their words, gazing at Luo Tian with a kind expression.
