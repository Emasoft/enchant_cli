“Apologies!” Luo Tian watched the youth charge toward him, sighing softly. Glowing runes spread across his fists, and he launched a strike at the silver twin hooks.

“Die!” The youth's eyes widened with delight as Luo Tian met his attack with his body.

The constraints of the rules made even flesh inferior to before, so those in the Heavenly Dao Realm were not much stronger.

Yet the youth's joy quickly turned to shock, for he faced Luo Tian.

Chapter 1757: The Night of Hou Heiye

A silver eagle soared through the sky, swiftly reaching Luo Tian's side. The twin hooks transformed into an eagle's beak, slicing through the air toward Luo Tian. The youth's heart brimmed with excitement—he hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so careless, meeting his attack head-on. After all, here was no longer the Three Thousand Small Worlds; the rules constrained even flesh.

“Boom…” A moment later, Luo Tian's golden fist collided with the eagle’s beak. The youth's face darkened instantly.

“Even under rule constraints, those not in the Heavenly Dao Realm are still far inferior!” Luo Tian murmured, observing a wound on his fist where the beak had pierced it, leaving a bloodstain.

The silver eagle exploded in an instant, and with it vanished the youth's body, now a swirling mist of blood scattered across the mountain peak.

One strike—another prodigy of the Age had fallen. Such was Luo Tian's terrifying might. Yet, his heart brimmed with unease; the youth had not revived after turning to mist. The vibrant life within the blood vanished swiftly.

“Why no blood regeneration? Is this how the Immortal Realm's rules work?” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze lingering on the crimson stain with concern.

Luo Tian feared no powerful opponent but worried about others. If they met someone like this youth, who was also in the Heavenly Dao Realm, how could they cope? Even Zhang Daotian or Gu Tianxiu might spill blood before such an opponent.

Though this youth had been easily defeated, he was still a prodigy. If Diao Dezhu or others encountered him, it would be no small challenge.

“What to do?” Luo Tian's heart raced as the scene around him shifted, revealing a forest.

“Already so fast!” Luo Tian's mind tensed as he saw another youth appear a hundred paces away.

Black hair cascaded over his shoulders, deep eyes radiating authority, clad in black combat attire. His presence felt like a vortex of darkness, pressing upon Luo Tian with an oppressive weight.

“Heavenly Dao Realm!” Both Luo Tian and the black-cloaked youth spoke in unison, their voices heavy with solemnity.

“Epoch Lords appear but once per era within the Nine Domains. Each supreme being is lonely, yet I never expected to meet another of my rank within the Immortal Road!” Luo Tian mused.

Luo Tian and the black-cloaked youth refrained from immediate combat, instead sizing each other up. The latter spoke first: “I hail from the Nightbound Realm; my name is Hou Heiye. In our world, I am known as the Nightbound Sovereign!”

“Nine Domains, Luo Tian. The Reincarnation Lord,” Luo Tian replied softly, a smile playing on his lips.

“Only one of us can survive this battle; dying at the hands of an equal is no disgrace!” Hou Heiye smiled, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Yet only one shall live,” Luo Tian mused, realization dawning—this was why the Demon Lord had perished on the Immortal Road. He must have faced a formidable opponent.

“Kill…” As Luo Tian's words faded, Hou Heiye surged forward, his feet propelling him toward Luo Tian.

Faced with another Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator, Luo Tian dared not underestimate him. After all, Hou Heiye was a master of his small world, wielding boundless techniques within the Three Thousand Small Worlds. Each such individual was no trifling foe—like the Epoch Lords of the Nine Domains, they were supreme in their own right.

Yet Luo Tian felt no fear; instead, a thrill surged within him. He had become an Epoch Lord for fifteen hundred years, yet he had never drawn his sword. Not because he lacked the will, but because no one in the Nine Domains could match him. Only if Zhang Daotian or the Demon Lord joined forces would he be forced to fight. But could he betray those he revered most?

“Crack…” A sharp sound echoed as golden and black fists collided. Both men staggered back, their faces etched with admiration.

“Such a nostalgic feeling… it feels like my time in the Bone-Devouring Realm!” Luo Tian mused, recalling how their battle mirrored that of his past—no flight, speed and strength seemingly constrained.

“Boom…” Luo Tian crashed through three trees before halting, marveling at Hou Heiye's might.

Hou Heiye’s eyes gleamed with admiration, his body retreating as his arm lost sensation.

“Such a formidable flesh! Even under constraints, it remains so strong!” Hou Heiye mused, halting his retreat before charging again.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The thunderous sound of their clash echoed through the forest, each strike a testament to their prowess. Neither had expected to fight like common cultivators.

Meanwhile, others on the Immortal Road adapted to the rules’ disappearance, embarking on their own battles.

“Pf!” Hou Heiye spat blood, halting as he gazed at Luo Tian, equally battered.

“Fulfilling! It has been ages since I felt such exhilaration—what matter if I die?” Hou Heiye laughed, his hands moving as he unleashed a technique. A surge of black energy erupted from him, enveloping both men in darkness.

“Burial of Night!” Hou Heiye roared, and the world turned pitch-black, blinding Luo Tian.

“Kill…” A wind whispered behind Luo Tian as a black blade materialized, striking with blinding speed.

Luo Tian’s heart jolted; instinctively, he tilted his body, and the blade pierced his shoulder. Golden blood glowed vividly in the darkness. Amidst it, Luo Tian glimpsed Hou Heiye’s face, marveling at his strength before flicking out several sharp glints from his hand.

“Damn! Missed again!” He cursed, retrieving the Splitting Heaven Spear. His eyes flashed with violet light, like two lightning bolts piercing through the night, briefly illuminating Hou Heiye’s position.

“Spear Lord of the Heavens!” Luo Tian roared, ignoring his wounded shoulder. He knew every strike against another Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator was precious.

The spear cleaved through the darkness, appearing in Hou Heiye’s path. Hou Heiye was startled; though he had evaded the previous glints, this golden spear brought immense pressure.

Sparks flew as the black blade clashed with the golden spear, and Luo Tian’s arm trembled.

“Die!” A cold, authoritative voice echoed behind Luo Tian, but this time he was prepared. As the black blade emerged, his soul passage roared within his dantian, and a surge of immortal energy enveloped his fists. The Dao-Defying Fist of the Wheel struck Hou Heiye.

“Fear me not!” Seeing Luo Tian’s unyielding attack, Hou Heiye bellowed, no trace of fear.

“Pf!” Cold energy seeped into Luo Tian’s body, but his fist landed squarely on Hou Heiye’s form.

Hou Heiye spat blood, vanishing into the endless darkness. Luo Tian stood still as his soul passage hummed, countering the encroaching black energy.

“This darkness is不利 to me!” Luo Tian murmured, gripping the Splitting Heaven Spear as a spear-shaped aura surrounded him. It swirled into a terrifying storm, sweeping outward.

The hum reverberated; the darkness that had consumed the world began to disperse.

As the dark veil lifted, both men stood amidst ruins, Hou Heiye’s battered form visible. His robes were stained with blood, and his chest was caved in.

Luo Tian fared no better; two holes marred his left shoulder, black energy clashing with his immortal aura. His forehead veins pulsed violently.

“Again!” Luo Tian roared, dashing forward with the spear toward Hou Heiye.

“Mistake!” Hou Heiye struggled to rise, cursing himself for underestimating Luo Tian’s attack.

The clash resumed as Luo Tian wielded the spear, relentless in his assault. He knew his strength lay in his flesh; Hou Heiye had underestimated it, allowing Luo Tian to wound him. If Hou Heiye hadn’t traded injury for injury, the outcome would have been different.

Golden spear shadows rained down like hail, Hou Heiye deflecting them while retreating. The black blade danced in his hands, its clash echoing before him.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian felt his arms as if they were no longer his own, while Hou Heiye bore countless wounds. Though he deflected relentlessly, he was still gravely injured.

Chapter 1758: Defying Heaven

“Pf!” The golden spear pierced Hou Heiye’s heart, exiting through his back. A bitter smile graced Hou Heiye’s lips.

“Never expected to fall here, in the Immortal Road, after eight thousand years of invincibility in the Nightbound Realm!” Hou Heiye spat blood, his voice devoid of resentment.

“Yet meeting another like me is a blessing; at least I won’t die at the hands of those barely in the Heavenly Dao Realm!” Hou Heiye gazed at Luo Tian.

“You are strong—stronger than I. You’ve shown me the world beyond my own. I hope you’ll eventually enter the Immortal Realm!” Hou Heiye spoke, then closed his eyes.

“Apologies,” Luo Tian murmured, discomfort gnawing at him. They had no enmity, yet they fought to the death here.

“Frustrating rules!” Luo Tian withdrew his spear, gazing at the sky, cursing under his breath.

“Hum…” Before Luo Tian’s words faded, a surge of energy struck him, his face darkening.

In an instant, a grand arena materialized beneath Luo Tian’s feet. The platform was immense, and across from him stood a towering figure, leaving Luo Tian awestruck.

He had seen many tall figures—like Chen Zhanbiao or Chu Chen, transformed into human forms—but this man towered over even the normal-sized Chen Zhanbiao.

“Heavenly Dao Realm!” The giant roared as soon as Luo Tian appeared, but upon spotting the two wounds on Luo Tian’s shoulder, his face lit up with joy.

“A Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator wounded—this is my chance!” The giant laughed, fearing Luo Tian would recover and kill him.

With that, the giant brandished a massive hammer adorned with intricate runes, radiating immense power. He hurled it toward Luo Tian.

“Not giving me time to recover?” Luo Tian mused, praying that if his friends faced a wounded Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator, they’d have a chance.

“Die!” As Luo Tian’s thoughts lingered, pressure descended upon him. Though he had fought Hou Heiye and was wounded, he faced the giant without fear. The Splitting Heaven Spear materialized in his hand as he swung it toward the hammer’s descent.

“Crack…” Thunderous sound echoed; the giant struck fast, but his retreat was just as swift. Blood spewed from him as his arms shattered, and the hammer flew away.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, cracks spreading beneath his feet as he marveled at the fight. Yet his spear was thrown from his hand, piercing the giant’s chest and pinning him to the arena. Luo Tian felt even more discomfort; though the giant had struck first, they had no prior connection.

“This Immortal Road is forged with blood!” Luo Tian murmured, the scene shifting again.

Meanwhile, others fought as well, each encountering formidable opponents. Yet in this Immortal Road, Heavenly Dao Realm cultivators were rare, so none had met one yet.

“Catch me if you can! Come on!” Diao Dezhu transformed into a purple lightning bolt, his sharp claws slicing through a half-Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator’s throat.

“Boom…” Yao Chen swung his golden staff, shattering a man, his eyes glowing with weakness.

“This is a fine place!” Yao Chen mused, his battle spirit ablaze as the scene shifted.

“I always said my luck was extraordinary; in the Immortal Realm, my fortune will return!” Tu Feiyang laughed, watching a half-dead opponent.

“Never expected my opponent to be a Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator, wounded like this!” Tu Feiyang mused, gazing at the dying opponent.

“You must have been a great cultivator in life; dying by my hand might disappoint you, but I’ve always had good luck. Unless I meet that bastard Luo Tian, I’ll surely survive!” Tu Feiyang withdrew his crimson blade, plunging it into the opponent’s heart to end their life.

Battles raged on; Luo Tian felt trapped in endless combat, the scenes shifting endlessly, opponents changing constantly. His wounds multiplied, like ants biting an elephant.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian lost track of how long he had fought, his heart burdened with a heavy sorrow.

“Cough… cough…” On the golden altar, Luo Tian stood battered, and across from him stood another figure, equally disheveled but radiating power.

“Yu Changtian, the Water-Devouring Realm,” a middle-aged man smiled, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Nine Domains, Luo Tian,” Luo Tian sighed; Yu Changtian was the third Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator he had faced after Hou Heiye.

“Begin! The victor enters the Immortal Realm; the loser dies!” Yu Changtian roared, his wounded body charging toward Luo Tian.

“Why must we fight here?” Luo Tian sighed, exhaustion etched in his eyes. He had killed countless warriors, two of them Heavenly Dao Realm cultivators.

Once renowned in their own small worlds, these men now fought for a chance to enter the Immortal Realm.

“Rules dictate it; there’s no choice,” Yu Changtian paused at Luo Tian’s words, sensing this youth was different.

“Rules? What rules force us to be bound like this?” Luo Tian raised his hands, envisioning countless souls swirling around him.

Luo Tian was no killer; he had never shown mercy to enemies, but now guilt gnawed at him. Though he adhered to the principle of not striking first, others still attacked him.

“Indeed, we are the same, yet under these rules, we seem so small—like ants controlled by fate!” Yu Changtian, a Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator, understood Luo Tian’s words and stood still.

“Heavenly Dao is unkind; it treats all as grass.” Luo Tian murmured, his eyes flashing with coldness. He thought of his life.

“If one wishes to become an immortal, they must first defy Heaven!” Luo Tian repeated the phrase, a sense stirring within him but elusive.

“If one wishes to become an immortal, they must first defy Heaven… this Heaven…” Yu Changtian pondered Luo Tian’s words, gradually grasping their meaning.

For the first time, Luo Tian and Yu Changtian did not fight upon meeting but sat cross-legged on the solid altar, deep in thought.

“Hum…” A surge of energy radiated from Luo Tian—his unique aura as a Soul-Subduing Master.

At that moment, the Immortal Road trembled; waves of gray energy rose from it.

Spirits—countless souls—suddenly ascended, stirred by Luo Tian’s melancholy. They burned with intense resentment, rushing in all directions.

A formidable power—capable of destroying heaven and earth—raged against the golden passage.

“Crack…” A thunderous collision echoed, and those still fighting trembled, feeling the ground beneath them quake violently.

“What’s happening?” All were stunned, their eyes trembling, even the Heavenly Dao Realm cultivators feeling their insignificance.

“Treat all as grass, yet water can carry a boat or capsize it!” Luo Tian opened his eyes slowly, his gaze cold.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The deafening sound of waves surged endlessly, and the vast Immortal Road finally collapsed.

As the road shattered, the altar beneath Luo Tian and Yu Changtian trembled violently, a powerful surge affecting both.

“This…” Yu Changtian’s eyes widened in disbelief, sensing the youth’s unfathomable depth. He felt he was witnessing something monumental.

“What is happening?” All were terrified, a surge of light enveloping those who had stopped fighting.

In the Upper Three Heavens, on Mount Tianji, an ancient elder’s face showed shock.

“The Immortal Road has collapsed; the fate has ended! It truly happened!” The elder spoke in disbelief, his eyes glowing with light.

On another mountain, Mount Yongsheng, within a grand hall, the formidable Yongsheng Immortal King sat, his back massaged by beautiful attendants.

“Hum…” Waves of energy emanated from the Yongsheng Immortal King’s hands, and a golden scroll appeared in his grasp.

“Do your utmost; those who ascend to the Immortal Realm today must come to Mount Yongsheng!” The authoritative voice echoed across the mountain.

Chapter 1759: Entering the Lower Three Heavens

“Boom… boom…” The deafening sound of collapse echoed, and the vast passage shattered endlessly, as if the world had ended. Wild energy swept through.

“What is happening?” All gazed in terror at the gray waves engulfing their space.

“Hum…” The next moment, energy surged over all on the Immortal Road, darkening their faces further.

“This…” Yu Changtian’s face showed awe, staring at the youth before him. If not for his own eyes, he would never believe this scene was achievable by a Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator.

A storm of winds swept over Yu Changtian, pain like a knife cutting through him. He hadn’t reacted before being swept up by the golden storm.

Luo Tian was no different; he was lifted into the storm, unable to see anything around him.

Dizziness overtook Luo Tian within minutes, and the entire Immortal Road’s people were swept into the golden storm.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian clung desperately to consciousness, fighting to stay alert.

“Ah…” All screamed, their voices filled with terror; they didn’t know where they would be taken or what awaited them. The storm’s sound drowned their voices.

Luo Tian was no different; his mind was hazy, biting his teeth to stay clear.

But as time passed, he could no longer endure and fell into unconsciousness, leaving himself to the storm’s will.

“Damn it!” His last thought was this before losing consciousness.

…

The Lower Three Heavens.

Though the Lower Three Heavens were the lowest region of the Immortal Realm, they were still vast. Recently, a great event had occurred there.

A thunderous explosion echoed through the Lower Three Heavens, and a powerful storm descended from the void, piercing through heaven and earth. The storm’s power was immense, quickly drawing the attention of many sects in the Lower Three Heavens.

But when they arrived to investigate, the storm abruptly ceased. A series of glowing streaks, like meteors, shot from the storm’s core toward all directions across the Lower Three Heavens. No one knew what those streaks were.

In a verdant forest, golden meteors streaked across the sky, and a bloodstained figure crashed into the green woods with a thud.

“Boom…” The earth was cratered, and many trees were uprooted.

“Hiss…” A gasp of pain echoed as Luo Tian regained a sliver of awareness, his lips twitching. He slowly opened his eyes.

“Where am I?” Luo Tian’s mind raced, then relief flooded him as his weary eyes glowed.

“It’s not Qi; it’s Immortal Energy!” Luo Tian mused, sensing the world had changed. The realm was no longer the Nine Domains’ Qi but Immortal Energy—though thin, it was undeniably Immortal.

“This is the Immortal Realm!” Luo Tian instantly knew he had entered it, as the rules here matched those on the Immortal Road.

Moreover, he felt his lifespan had shrunk to a shocking number—just one thousand years.

“One thousand… To live longer, I must ascend to a higher realm!” Luo Tian mused, no longer worrying about his dwindling lifespan but instead examining his injuries.

His vast spiritual awareness spread outward, but soon his face showed a wry smile.

“One thousand zhang… My spiritual awareness is suppressed…” Luo Tian sighed, feeling no danger within a thousand zhang before beginning his recovery.

“Hmm?” But as Luo Tian just started to recover, his eyes snapped open.

“So fast…” His eyes showed admiration. Though this world had thinner Immortal Energy, its effect was remarkable. The deep wounds on his body healed at a visible rate.

“At this speed, I can recover from injuries that took a month in the Nine Domains within seven days!” Luo Tian marveled, appreciating this realm’s benefits.

He continued his recovery, for he was a stranger here and felt it wise to be cautious. Though the Heaven-Defying Sword wasn’t with him, he was a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Before gaining strength, it was better to stay low.

Three days passed silently; Luo Tian’s injuries healed rapidly. Meanwhile, he felt his body changing as well. His flesh had adapted to the Immortal Realm’s rules on the Immortal Road, and now with Immortal Energy nurturing it, his body gradually strengthened.

“This truly is a good place; turning people into commoners, with enough time, even flesh and soul, and dantian cultivation to the Immortal Realm are just a matter of time!” Luo Tian sighed.

“First priority: recover my injuries, then find out where I am and understand the Immortal Realm’s forces. After all, the Upper Three Heavens’ nine mountains are too far away! And I must hurry to reach cultivation’s peak!”

“The flow of time in the Immortal Realm differs from the Nine Domains. If I stay too long, returning to the Nine Domains might mean my loved ones…?” Luo Tian mused, then closed his eyes again. He felt time was everything in the Immortal Realm.

“Big brother, where do we find easy prey here?” A rough voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears as two figures appeared within his perception.

Within his awareness, two hulking men stood before him—rugged faces, one with an eye patch. Clearly not good people.

Their strength was no more than that of a peak Epoch cultivator in the Nine Domains, but Luo Tian knew such men were nothing here.

“Alas… Brother, when I become rich, I’ll treat you to the best!” The eye-patched man addressed his companion.

“Big brother, Liu Ermaizi looked down on us; what do we do? He’s a favorite of the leader!” The other man replied with a bitter smile.

“Alas… Liu Ermaizi, when I’m strong enough, I’ll make that old bastard lick my shoes!” The eye-patched man’s single eye flashed with hatred.

As they approached, within three to four hundred zhang of Luo Tian, a smile formed on his face. He had been worried about finding someone to learn about the Immortal Realm, and these two were clearly local gangsters.

“Big… big… Big brother…” As they drew closer, the man with a complete eye stammered.

“Erniu, don’t be nervous and stutter; what’s there to fear? You know this is our Fire-Blaze Sect’s territory!” The eye-patched man’s eyes lit up, gazing at Luo Tian’s ragged clothes with a glint of greed.

“Kid, which faction are you from? Do you have anything valuable to hand over? We’ll take it!” The eye-patched man barked, his voice fierce.

“Come here!” But before the man’s words finished, a commanding voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears like thunder. A massive pressure descended upon the two men, causing their bodies to tremble instantly.

“Beyond Half-Heavenly Dao Realm!” The two men felt the immense pressure, recalling only their leader Zhu Fenghuo’s.

“F-F-Foreigner…” The rugged-faced man stammered, his voice trembling.

“Tell me, where is this?” Luo Tian smiled, having seen many people; he ignored them but their eyes saw something unappealing.

“Foreigner, this is the domain of the Heaven-Door Sect; we call it Broken Dragon Mountain. It’s a minor place under the Heaven-Door Sect,” the eye-patched man replied respectfully.

“Your Fire-Blaze Sect is a bandit group, right?” Luo Tian smirked. Though his injuries weren’t fully healed, he had the upper hand against two peak Epoch cultivators.

“Not lying, we are bandits who rob others. But we’re unlucky; we were assigned to this desolate place and met you by mistake!” The eye-patched man spoke, gazing at Luo Tian, thinking that this young man looked battered and injured. If they could recruit him into their Fire-Blaze Sect, they’d surely gain great credit with their leader Zhu Fenghuo.

“I meant to ask—where is this? Upper Three Heavens, Lower Three Heavens, or Middle?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, gazing at the two men. From the eye-patched man’s words, he had some guesses.

“F-Foreigner, this is the Lower Three Heavens…” The stammering man replied with confusion.

“Alright, tell me what evil deeds you’ve done in recent years,” Luo Tian coldly ordered, scanning the two men. These two were clearly no good people.
