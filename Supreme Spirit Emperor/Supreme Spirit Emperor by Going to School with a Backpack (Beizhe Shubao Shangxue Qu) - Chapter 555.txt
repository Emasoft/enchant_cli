The image was etched with intricate patterns, and at its center hung a sharp sword. A long dragon coiled around the blade.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, committing the fragmentary map to memory, but he failed to comprehend its meaning. Zhou Sha began pacing through the ruins, summoning array flags in his hands and planting them into the ground.

Each time a flag was planted, threads of soul-destroying qi filled it, causing Luo Tian to marvel.

"Such brutality and rapid cultivation of the Bloodthirsty Lord stem from this soul-destroying qi!"

"Though it appears normal, the invisible soul-destroying qi still affects people's minds. However, its power is weak, so none notice it," Zhou Sha murmured, driving another flag into the earth.

After thirty-six array flags appeared in Luo Tian's group's view, Zhou Sha smiled slightly before slapping his hand against the ground. The flags emitted waves of energy.

"Crack..." Each array flag's base began to crack, and Zhou Sha's face lit up with excitement.

"Indeed, this fragmentary map did not deceive me. Perhaps the Longyuan Sword lies beneath!" Zhou Sha shouted triumphantly.

Within moments, the ground was riddled with fissures. Waves of凶煞 (soul-destroying) qi surged upward, continuing to expand until the earth shattered with a resounding crash.

The area within a hundred paces transformed into an opening, debris flying and wind howling from the hole—yet this wind was composed of soul-destroying qi.

Luo Tian and his companions stood before the opening, their faces filled with surprise. Zhou Sha's eyes gleamed with wild joy as he felt the dense soul-destroying qi emanating from the hole. Without hesitation, he leapt into it, vanishing from their sight.

"We should go too," Luo Tian said, his heart racing at the discovery of such a hidden realm beneath Tiansha City.

Luo Tian's group leapt into the black hole, their ears filled with howling winds that felt like blades slicing through them.

"It's sword qi!" Ye Chen exclaimed, the weak but sharp qi cutting their bodies and sparking fire.

"This is merely the entrance; imagine how strong it would be deeper within! Even if this isn't where Longyuan Sword lies, there must be a treasure imbued with terrifying soul-destroying qi and sword intent!" Huang Baisui murmured.

After half a bell, Luo Tian's group finally landed on the ground, finding Zhou Sha already waiting for them.

They landed in a vast hall, its emptiness unmarred by dampness—instead, it radiated intense heat.

The hall's walls were barren, resembling a forge with numerous forging tables arranged there.

"Correct! This must be an ancient site, the place where Longyuan Sword was forged!" Zhou Sha declared, his voice laced with awe.

"Clang... clang..." The sound of collisions echoed from the forging tables as discarded scraps of metal began moving on their own.

"A hum..." A wave of energy rose, and spectral figures appeared before the forging tables, visible to Luo Tian's group.

Red eyes burned with infinite hatred, locking onto Luo Tian's group, causing Da Yangui and Ye Chen to startle.

"This is a soul-destroying ghost!" Zhou Sha immediately retreated, thrusting a broken long sword into the spot where he had stood.

"It's said every legendary凶剑 (soul-destroying sword) requires blood for sacrifice. When Longyuan Sword was born, the blacksmith sacrificed an entire city of Longyuan to achieve its fame. These ghosts must be the unquiet souls of deceased disciples, fused with this dense soul-destroying qi!" Zhou Sha murmured.

As Zhou Sha spoke, dozens of ghosts wielding broken weapons rushed toward them.

"A hum..." Luo Tian's group闪动 (dodged), charging at the ghosts. These spirits were weak, their strongest only at the early stage of True Immortal—Luo Tian's group dismissed them.

Within moments, the ghosts were shattered by their attacks, dissolving into waves of soul-destroying qi that swept through the hall. The dense qi began to erode Luo Tian's group.

"I'll take care of this soul-destroying qi," Zhou Sha smiled, for him it was like a nourishing supplement.

Zhou Sha inhaled deeply, absorbing the soul-destroying qi that made his face flush with vitality.

"If I absorb all the soul-destroying qi in this underground palace, not only will I recover to the late stage of True Immortal, but I might even advance further into the peak of True Immortal," Zhou Sha's face lit with excitement.

"Let's go out!" Luo Tian said, smiling as he walked toward the hall's entrance.

The group followed Luo Tian out of the hall, and upon exiting, they were stunned.

The view was boundless, with dilapidated buildings appearing before their eyes—this wasn't underground but a city.

"Longyuan City!" In an instant, the group saw the massive gate, their faces filled with exclamations.

"Longyuan City... Longyuan Sword. Is this truly the location of Longyuan Sword?" Luo Tian's group looked at each other in disbelief.

"This hall was where the disciples of Longyuan Sect resided; the Forge Hall is the core of the entire Longyuan Sect!" Zhou Sha shouted, pulling them out of their trance.

"Let's go..." The group didn't hesitate, despite the surrounding soul-destroying qi. Zhou Sha had no time to absorb it now; they searched for the Forge Hall within the open mountain gate.

"Expending the entire sect's resources and sacrificing all disciples' lives to forge a legendary凶剑 (soul-destroying sword), was this worth it?" Luo Tian mused, imagining how Longyuan Sect must have been a powerful city before its destruction by a sword.

Yet Luo Tian understood—though forging differed from alchemy, he recalled how Long Xiao had sacrificed himself in the Dragon's Tomb of the Nine Domains to forge a single immortal pill. If one became obsessed, they wouldn't care about their life. This Longyuan City's ruler was also ruthless, disregarding both his own and the city's people's lives.

Time passed slowly as they walked through Longyuan City's ruins, resisting the powerful soul-destroying qi.

Within half an hour, Luo Tian's group finally found the core of Longyuan City—the Forge Hall!

The soul-destroying qi here was the densest, even making Luo Tian pale. Only True Immortals could withstand it; if a Heaven-Immortal came, they'd be corrupted within minutes.

The words "Forge Hall" hovered above the hall, though it had endured countless years, its aura remained formidable. The soul-destroying qi added an eerie sense of fear to Luo Tian's group.

"Let's go!" Zhou Sha pushed open the hall's door, and immediately a gust of wind surged forth. A cold soul-destroying qi burst from the hall, blocking Luo Tian's group's path.

"A hum..." The group raised a barrier to block the terrifying soul-destroying qi, but it still eroded their defenses as if countless swords continuously cut through their barrier.

"Let's go in together!" Luo Tian said, and the group gathered to form a barrier, finally resisting the terrifying sword qi.

Stepping into the hall, Luo Tian's heart jolted—everything was red, with a scorching heat rising from the ground.

"Rumbling... rumbling..." A torrent of flowing sound echoed in their ears, and red magma flowed into view.

Above the magma, long swords floated, each radiating powerful spiritual laws and sword intent that made Luo Tian's group pale.

"It's a Sword Herd!" Zhou Sha said, his eyes alight with desire as he gazed at the swords floating above the magma.

"Only top-grade immortal swords can naturally draw other long swords to form a Sword Herd."

"This must be the core magma, using its supreme yang energy to suppress Longyuan Sword's soul-destroying qi!"

"And Longyuan Sword is alive; these swords must have been drawn by it to protect itself! Longyuan Sword must be among these swords!"

"There are ten thousand swords, their power nearly identical, all at the middle grade ghost weapon level. How do we find it?"

"Also, how do we cross this magma? I feel that stepping on it would turn us to ashes!" Ye Chen said, his gaze fixed on the swords floating above the magma.

Ye Chen extended a hand, channeling True Immortal power into a massive hand to grasp one of the floating swords.

"Rumbling... rumbling..." But as soon as it moved, a wave of energy surged upward. The hand formed by True Immortal power twisted and was eventually transformed into a flame, falling into the magma.

"Even magma that can burn True Immortal power must be accessible only to Heaven-Immortals!" Da Yangui sighed deeply.

"At this moment, the magma itself emitted waves of energy, surging and forming a humanoid figure made of magma, each holding a red magma-formed long sword."

"What is this thing?" Luo Tian's group immediately retreated, but the hall was too small to escape.

"It's a Sword Slave!"

"Guardians of Longyuan Sword, they were once humans but were controlled by Longyuan Sword. They abandoned their bodies and merged with the magma, forming this shape!" Zhou Sha murmured, his expression grave.

"Rumbling... rumbling..." Eight magma-formed figures凝聚 (congregated), each holding a fiery red long sword, rushing toward Luo Tian's group.

"Let's exit the hall first!" Luo Tian frowned, raising a torrent of divine fire to envelop the entire hall. The scorching heat instantly spread throughout, making the hall feel like it was submerged in magma.

The group's barrier began to melt, causing their faces to shift slightly.

"The soul-destroying qi has lessened; we can try!" Zhou Sha said, his gaze on the swords in the magma.

"What are we trying? Each of these magma figures is at the middle stage of True Immortal, and they're made of magma. Once we touch them, our weapons will surely be melted!" Da Yangui shouted fearfully.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's hands moved, unleashing a torrent of eight-colored fire that enveloped them. The magma figures paused momentarily but still rushed toward Luo Tian's group.

"You try to break through the hall, I'll deal with these magma figures!" Luo Tian shouted, his body covered in eight-colored flames as he dashed toward a magma figure. He punched it directly in the chest.

The fist wrapped in eight-colored flames pierced through the magma figure's chest. Luo Tian's full power could kill a True Immortal at the early stage, but the pierced figure showed no reaction. A fiery red long sword descended upon Luo Tian.

Magma covered Luo Tian's arm, making him feel intense heat. Even with eight-colored flames protecting him, the magma's temperature was no less than his flames.

Sword intent surged skyward; the fiery red long sword descended with overwhelming might, cutting down toward Luo Tian.

"Crack Heaven Spear!" Luo Tian roared, withdrawing his fist and drawing a crack heaven spear in his other hand to block the eight swords' attack.

The collision echoed, and the eight magma figures were repelled by Luo Tian, who stood up, radiating overwhelming power.

"A hum..." The spear swept across, its dark aura flashing as it slashed at the eight magma figures' waists.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The eight magma figures were shattered into magma, then rapidly reformed to attack Luo Tian again.

Scorching sword qi continuously swept over him, and Luo Tian fought eight figures alone, showing some strain but still managing to suppress them.

"Indeed, the master!" Da Yangui and others said with admiration, continuously striking at the magma-encased hall's door.

"But it's no use! These eight figures are immortal and endless!" Zhou Sha said, his voice laced with urgency.

"Longyuan Sword is a divine artifact; obtaining it requires not just strength but also fate!" Zhou Sha shouted, his eyes seeming to recall something. He hesitated before speaking.

"What's on your mind? Speak quickly, don't be so hesitant!" Da Yangui glared at Zhou Sha.

"I think we should try using everyone's blood; maybe it will succeed!" Zhou Sha said, revealing his plan.

"Rubbish! Can you tell which one is Longyuan Sword?" Da Yangui retorted.

"Longyuan Sword is the king of swords, though hidden, it's a legendary凶剑 (soul-destroying sword) that gathered the entire city's resentment. It must be bloodthirsty; if we offer our blood, it might summon the true Longyuan Sword!" Zhou Sha said.

"You go first!" Luo Tian ordered Zhou Sha, sensing something was off with him. He shot a spear, shattering eight magma figures again.

"Good!" Zhou Sha nodded, biting his finger to release a drop of black blood.

"A hum..." As Zhou Sha's blood appeared, the swords floating above the magma trembled and emitted waves of energy.

"There's a reaction!" Zhou Sha exclaimed, then looked at the others.

But as soon as he was excited, the swords only trembled slightly before returning to calm.

"Try again! Maybe something will change!" Zhou Sha urged the group.

"I'll try!" Huang Baisui shouted, extending a hand to release a drop of blood imbued with divine essence.

"Rumbling... rumbling..." Ten thousand swords trembled, rotating continuously. A stream of light shot up, piercing through the flames to appear before Huang Baisui's blood, coating the drop with its blade.

"This sword is a top-grade ghost weapon! If our blood is strong enough, it might summon Longyuan Sword!" Zhou Sha's eyes showed disappointment because his blood had no effect.

Ye Chen and Da Yangui's faces also showed envy, their eyes eager as they extended their hands to release three drops of blood.

"A hum..." The swords trembled again, moving continuously. Three streams of light shot toward Ye Chen and Da Yangui.

"Another top-grade long sword! There are only two top-grade ghost weapons here, and both have emerged!" Zhou Sha said, his eyes filled with shock.

Three black dragons rushed toward Ye Chen and Da Yangui; the other two swords were at the middle grade ghost weapon level, making them top contenders among these swords.

Under their gaze, the sword radiating overwhelming power landed in Ye Chen's hand, causing the group to look at him with envy.

"It's just him left!" The group looked expectantly toward Luo Tian, hoping he would summon Longyuan Sword since they all knew his blood was powerful enough to even shock the Bloodthirsty Lord.

"A hum..." Luo Tian shattered several magma figures, his expression thoughtful. He had been exhausted for some time, even his eight-colored flames dimmed slightly, but the red magma figures reformed each time with overwhelming might.

"Let's try!" Luo Tian extended a hand, and under the group's expectant gaze, he released a drop of blood.

"Boom... boom..." As Luo Tian's drop of blood appeared, the sword trembled violently, emitting a powerful wave. An overwhelming aura spread outward.

In an instant, all the swords trembled, even those in Huang Baisui and Ye Chen's hands. They shook violently, trying to break free from their grasp to return to the Sword Herd.

Crack... crack... crack...

All swords shattered, and Huang Baisui's group's swords also broke into fragments of spiritual laws, flying toward the mass of spiritual law fragments.

The spiritual law fragments hovered above the magma, then began to rapidly reassemble, gathering together to form a dragon. The dragon rushed into the magma.

Drenched in red magma, it swam around once before appearing before everyone's eyes. The dragon's head became the sword hilt, and its body formed the blade. Soul-destroying qi surged skyward, and magma roared, yet it couldn't withstand the overwhelming soul-destroying qi.

"墨龙在源，龙渊剑!" Everyone's eyes widened in shock, staring at the black sword radiating overwhelming power.

"A hum..." The sword's cry echoed, and the black sword flew toward Luo Tian, its sword intent terrifying. The eight magma figures were shattered under its overwhelming might.

The black sword, stained with Luo Tian's blood, formed a strange seal and hovered above his head.

"Has it accepted you as its master?" Ye Chen exclaimed, staring at the black sword radiating overwhelming power. He felt he couldn't withstand its might.

"At last, it's done!" Zhou Sha's face was filled with excitement as he looked at the black sword. It even broke through his eight-colored flames, flying toward it.

"Suicide!" Huang Baisui's face darkened, and yellow river water surged toward Zhou Sha.

"Only you?" Zhou Sha's face showed contempt, suddenly pointing his finger. The black sword hovering above Luo Tian's head emitted a hum and slashed toward the yellow river water.

Light flashed, but before the black sword reached the yellow river water, it was already cut by its terrifying sword intent.

"Be careful!" Luo Tian moved swiftly, appearing before Huang Baisui and raising his crack heaven spear to meet the black sword.

"Crack..." The black sword cut against Luo Tian's crack heaven spear, sparks flying everywhere. Luo Tian's arms felt numb, and sword intent swept over his body, leaving wounds on him.

"Zhou Sha, what are you trying to do?" Da Yangui and others looked at Zhou Sha with anger.

"What? You still don't understand?" Zhou Sha's face was playful, his aura changed completely. He extended a hand to grab the black sword, which appeared beside him and was grabbed by Zhou Sha.

"I should thank you all; without your help, I couldn't have awakened it. To express my gratitude, I'll make you the soul of Longyuan Sword. How does that sound?" Zhou Sha's gaze finally fell on Luo Tian.

"Only you?" Luo Tian showed disdain, looking at Zhou Sha to see what trick he was up to.

"Living sacrifice! Begin!" Zhou Sha gently caressed the black sword, his hands flashing with light as he etched seals onto it.

"A hum..." Waves of soul-destroying qi spread from Longyuan Sword, causing Luo Tian's group to shift slightly.

Chapter 2117: Soul Slave

Five seals fell, and waves of suction spread. Luo Tian's group's faces changed dramatically as their blood began to flow wildly, trying to burst out of their bodies.

"Earlier drop of blood wasn't attracting Longyuan Sword but activating some secret method!" Ye Chen exclaimed, spitting out blood that was uncontrollably drawn toward Longyuan Sword.

Huang Baisui and Da Yangui also spat blood, even Luo Tian did so. Their blood was absorbed by Longyuan Sword, and spiritual light flowed along the sword edges, emitting an overwhelming aura.

"I can't control it!" Ye Chen's face changed again, spitting more blood. Huang Baisui and others did the same.

"Sacrificing your blood to awaken Longyuan Sword is an honor; you can close your eyes knowing you've seen its complete form!" Zhou Sha's eyes gleamed with madness, holding Longyuan Sword and looking at Luo Tian's group with a triumphant gaze.

"You've been scheming against us from the start. Who are you? Why do you know so much about Longyuan?" Luo Tian's face turned red as he stared at Zhou Sha standing there.

"I am the Lord of Longyuan City, Longyuan!"

"Years ago, I devoted an entire city to forge Longyuan Sword. Heaven did not disappoint my efforts; I finally succeeded. To achieve this, I sacrificed myself, becoming Longyuan's soul slave!"

"I originally planned to use the Bloodthirsty Lord, but you killed him. Your blood is so powerful it awakened Longyuan Sword!" Zhou Sha murmured, his voice laced with madness.

"Spit..." As he spoke, the five of them spat more blood, which was absorbed into Longyuan Sword.

"Ah! I see now!" Luo Tian's eyes showed understanding, realizing why the fragmentary map was unreadable—because it was Zhou Sha's own haphazard drawing.

He also understood why Zhou Sha knew so much about Longyuan City—everything was a scheme. They were never part of Zhou Sha's plan.

Originally, the Bloodthirsty Lord should have come here. The Bloodthirsty Lord's blood-sucking ability and his status as a True Immortal at the peak made him suitable for Zhou Sha's requirements. But they ruined Zhou Sha's plan, becoming the Bloodthirsty Lord's pawns.

"A hum..." A powerful sword intent surged, making Longyuan Sword even more terrifying.

"Let's do it again; Longyuan Sword will be fully awakened!"

"When it is fully awakened, I'll use this sword to kill you all. I'll extract your soul and take over your body, making you the soul of Longyuan Sword. From now on, I'll walk through hell under your identity. With Longyuan Sword, there will be a place for me in hell!" Zhou Sha said. At this point, he should be called Longyuan.

"Spit..." As Longyuan spoke, Luo Tian's group spat more blood uncontrollably, making their power wither and even losing some vitality.

As this drop of blood fell, Longyuan Sword was fully formed, radiating an overwhelming aura. It seemed to be able to split the heavens and earth, making Ye Chen's group pale.

"Is this Longyuan Sword?" Luo Tian also showed shock, staring at the black sword radiating overwhelming power.

Spiritual laws flowed, and the blade's edge emitted cracks in space, showing Longyuan Sword's sharpness.

"Now, you should die!" Longyuan smiled slightly and swung the sword toward Luo Tian's group.

A black crack appeared in the sky, slicing through like tofu. Longyuan merely waved his hand, and the void was cut.

One strike fell, splitting magma and eight-colored flames, instantly appearing above Luo Tian's group.

"Get out of the way!" Luo Tian roared, his crack heaven spear reappearing in both hands to meet the descending sword.

"Crack..." Thunderous sound echoed, spreading across eight directions. Luo Tian's face grew paler, and even his crack heaven spear had a gap.

"What good is it? With one sword in hand, the world is mine! This is the terror of the Seven Great凶剑 (soul-destroying swords)!" Longyuan's face showed excitement.

"How many years have I waited for this day? I've waited too long!"

"Yet, even if I paid more, it was all worth it!" Longyuan murmured, his body radiating a沧桑 (ancient) aura. He raised his hand again to strike.

"Dao Heart Sealing Demon!" Luo Tian murmured, extending a hand to grab a sound of dullness in Longyuan's body—this was the black pill Luo Tian had made him swallow earlier, now turning into waves of black qi surrounding Longyuan.

This black pill looked like a pill, but it was actually the seal of Dao Heart Sealing Demon condensed into. Whoever swallowed it would be activated by Luo Tian, causing an explosion.

This was Luo Tian's greatest reliance. He was confident that even if Zhou Sha was strong, he couldn't escape it. Nie Sheng had been sealed by Dao Heart Sealing Demon and hadn't escaped yet. Luo Tian understood the terrifying nature of Dao Heart Sealing Demon, as Nie Sheng was backed by the Eternal Mountain and the Eternal Immortal King, one of the strongest in the immortal world.

Longyuan's body paused slightly but then showed contempt, looking at Luo Tian.

"Do you know why I'm not afraid of your pill? Because I am not human! I am a soul slave! A part of Longyuan Sword. As long as Longyuan Sword is not destroyed, your methods can't destroy me!" Longyuan murmured.

Then, under Luo Tian's group's watch, he became a red phantom and black seal patterns flowed over his body.

"An impressive technique, but ultimately useless!" Longyuan flew up and directly entered Longyuan Sword.

"Now I'll kill you!" The black sword rose again, radiating an overwhelming aura.

"Was it useless?" Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly. He extended a hand, and the black seal patterns dragon flew out again, wrapping around Longyuan Sword before entering it.

"Dead..."

"What is this? I entered Longyuan Sword, but why can't I escape!" A cry echoed within Longyuan Sword.

"Ghost Blade!" Luo Tian's face showed coldness, his hands moving to summon a gray ghost blade above his head. He cast it toward Longyuan Sword.

"Ah..." The gray ghost blade entered Longyuan Sword, and a piercing scream echoed.

If the group could see inside Longyuan Sword, they would have seen a ghostly figure wrapped in black seal patterns, bound and unable to escape. The ghost struggled but couldn't break free. The ghost blade Luo Tian had just cast was cutting the ghost's arm.

"A hum..." Luo Tian continuously cast ghost blades toward Longyuan Sword, each entering it and cutting the ghost's figure.

Longyuan never expected Luo Tian to have this move, so he could only watch as each ghost blade dismembered him.

"Ten... twenty..." Until Luo Tian's face was pale and his spirit could no longer be consumed, he stopped.

Over a hundred ghost blades were cast by Luo Tian, leaving Ye Chen and the others stunned, looking at Luo Tian with shock.

"Is that spirit? Each ghost blade is powerful enough to severely wound our spirits. He cast over a hundred! My spirit is strong, but if I did that, I wouldn't last thirty times before dying!" Ye Chen looked at Luo Tian like he was a monster.

When Luo Tian cast the seventieth blade, Longyuan's screams stopped. Luo Tian felt Longyuan's death through Dao Heart Sealing Demon.

"Now, it's time to reforge the soul!" Luo Tian flew up and approached Longyuan Sword, grabbing it.

"A hum..." Longyuan Sword immediately emitted an overwhelming sword intent and didn't want Luo Tian to grab it, emitting waves of sword qi toward Luo Tian.

"Stay still!" Luo Tian sneered, allowing the waves of sword qi to sweep over him but still grabbing the dragon head hilt.

When Luo Tian grabbed the black hilt, Longyuan Sword violently shook and became more violent. Waves of intense soul-destroying qi spread from it.

Although Longyuan was killed by Luo Tian, his consciousness still influenced the current Longyuan Sword. It felt like a foe.

Soul-destroying qi surged skyward, violent waves swept over, and the magma below continuously roiled with a scorching heat, suppressing the cold soul-destroying qi.

Luo Tian immediately felt endless coldness. Even he almost lost his mind, being eroded by the powerful soul-destroying qi.

"It's too strong; I can only temporarily seal it!" Luo Tian made a decision, feeling that if he was hit by the soul-destroying qi for longer, he would be eroded and become a bloodthirsty person, completely lost like those sword slaves. It wasn't people controlling the swords but swords controlling people!

"A hum..." His hands moved, Luo Tian grabbed Longyuan Sword with one hand and continuously cast seals with the other—this was the Hundred Ghosts Seal.

Within a short time, the terrifying soul-destroying qi wrapped Luo Tian, and Ye Chen's group trembled. Though there was the heat of magma, they still felt a chill.

As Luo Tian continuously cast the Hundred Ghosts Seal, the soul-destroying qi began to reverse and return into Longyuan Sword.

Luo Tian's figure appeared in their sight, his breath heavy and eyes wary of the Longyuan Sword.

"Is there a scabbard?" Luo Tian looked at the magma, now he was half the owner of Longyuan Sword. He just needed the new soul within it to fully submit to him, and he could completely master Longyuan Sword.

"A hum..." Luo Tian held the wide Longyuan Sword, his power surged and he slashed at the magma.

"Rumbling... rumbling..." The overwhelming magma was split in two by Luo Tian's strike, revealing a red stone with a fire-red scabbard on it.

Chapter 2119: Tremor

The red stone and fire-red scabbard appeared, the scabbard seemingly naturally formed.

"Come here!" Luo Tian's body burned with eight-colored flames, flying toward the red scabbard and landing beside it.

"Ah, this stone is also a good item!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate and took the stone and scabbard together, fleeing before the magma healed.

"Rumbling... rumbling..." The magma roared as if angry, surging a massive wave toward Luo Tian's group the moment he took out the stone and scabbard.

"Run!" Luo Tian waved his hand, Longyuan Sword emitting an overwhelming sword aura and cutting through the hall. He then placed Longyuan Sword into its scabbard, grabbed the stone, and rushed out of the hall.

Huang Baisui and Ye Chen's faces changed dramatically, and they also flew up, following Luo Tian out of the hall.

"Boom..." As the group rushed out of the hall, the magma surged forward and chased after Luo Tian's group.

"Dammit, is this magma alive?" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, feeling the heat behind him and his scalp tingling.

"A hum..." At the moment the group rushed out of the hall, Luo Tian felt Longyuan Sword on his back trembling again. Cold soul-destroying qi spread, making his back icy.

"Damn it, it's coming out again!" Luo Tian cursed, understanding immediately that the scabbard could suppress part of the soul-destroying qi. His Hundred Ghosts Seal had also sealed some, but Longyuan Sword's soul-destroying qi was still terrifying. It had only been in the hall, where magma suppressed it.

Now they were out of the magma, so the soul-destroying qi previously suppressed by the magma would erupt.

"A hum..." He activated his power to suppress the soul-destroying qi.

"One percent... two percent... three percent..." Luo Tian continuously increased his power to suppress the soul-destroying qi, finally using four percent of his power to fully suppress it.

At this moment, the group had reached the hall they entered before. Without hesitation, they leapt up and rushed toward the broken roof of the hall. If they flew out, they would be free.

The scorching heat surged, and the red magma instantly submerged the entire Longyuan City's ruins. It quickly reached Luo Tian's group and began to chase them upward.

Chen Dao stood at the dark hole, his brows furrowed. He had watched Luo Tian's group enter the hole before but hadn't cared much, as Luo Tian's current strength was enough to handle them.

But now, Chen Dao felt a sense of alarm, especially with the rumbling beneath his feet. His face changed.

"Did something else happen?" Chen Dao murmured, gripping his long sword and stepping forward into the hole.

But as he stepped in, his face suddenly changed, and Luo Tian's group rushed past him.

"Boom..." Heat surged, terrifying red light shot up into the sky, piercing the heavens.

The flood of magma instantly submerged the entire Tiansha City, and even buildings not destroyed by Luo Tian and the Bloodthirsty Lord were completely gone.

The intense heat combined with the black clouds in the sky, and large raindrops began to fall, hitting the magma but having no effect.

The entire Tiansha City seemed like an apocalypse, and Luo Tian's group's mouths twitched as they watched the flowing magma.
