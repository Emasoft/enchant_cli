“Hmph, Old Sha. I heard you found a fine disciple. I didn’t expect you to take one in! Let’s see him!” Ke Zhen Tian spoke, his gaze directed toward where the Blue Dragon Sect disciples gathered. His eyes seemed to hold a sense of anticipation.

Hearing Ke Zhen Tian’s words, Jin Yong Si’s face bore a playful expression. He thought of his plan—absolutely foolproof. His heart sneered: “Hmph, disciple. That boy must be either in the White Tiger Sect or already in hell. There’s no disciple anymore!”

The thought of the Blue Dragon Sect’s Grand Master having his disciple killed, embarrassing Sha Cang Mang, made Jin Yong Si inwardly delighted. His eyes carried mockery as he gazed at the Blue Dragon Sect’s Grand Master, Sha Cang Mang.

“Indeed, Old Sha. Hurry up and bring out your precious disciple for Old Ke to see!” Jin Yong Si added fuel to the fire, addressing Sha Cang Mang directly.

“Hmph!” Seeing Jin Yong Si’s overconfident demeanor, Sha Cang Mang’s face turned as cold as ice.

“Dead?” Feeling the chill in Sha Cang Mang’s gaze, Jin Yong Si felt even more triumphant.

“Hum…” A wave of energy spread. Sha Cang Mang waved his sleeve, and Luo Tian along with his hundred attendants appeared in the sky, their faces bewildered.

“What is this?” The crowd on the Divine Reckoning Continent wore puzzled expressions, gazing at the hundred attendants with Binding God’s Belts, including Luo Tian. They wondered where these people had come from.

“Blue Dragon Sect’s attendants?” Naturally, people recognized the Binding God’s Belts. Yet they couldn’t fathom why the sect’s Grand Master would bring so many attendants, as attendants were of low status in all sects and rarely came to the Divine Reckoning Continent.

“Look! One of the attendants is a Three-source Immortal. My heavens!” People finally noticed Luo Tian’s presence, sensing his cultivation was a Three-source Immortal. Their faces bore shock.

“Rebellious! A mere attendant is a Three-source Immortal. If he becomes a direct disciple, what would that mean?” People began to loudly discuss.

The Blue Dragon Sect disciples, seeing Luo Tian had become a Three-source Immortal, some of their faces lit up. The sect’s few Three-source Immortals were known—Si Ma Qiong had achieved a Four-source Immortal just before the competition, which had greatly energized the Blue Dragon Sect disciples.

Now that Luo Tian had become a Three-source Immortal, the Blue Dragon Sect disciples finally wore expressions of joy. They knew Luo Tian’s terrifying combat power. People believed that a Three-source Immortal like Luo Tian could fully match an ordinary Four-source Immortal. This made the Blue Dragon Sect’s chances of victory even greater.

“How about it? You’re surprised to see my disciple?” Sha Cang Mang changed from his cold demeanor, a slight smile on his face as he addressed Jin Yong Si.

“Impossible!” Jin Yong Si’s face bore shock, his mouth wide open as if he could fit an egg inside. His eyes held disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian standing in the sky.

At Jin Yong Si’s astonishment, a Seven-source Heaven Immortal from the White Tiger Sect appeared behind him, his face showing slight anxiety. He whispered a few words into Jin Yong Si’s ear.

Jin Yong Si’s face finally changed drastically, his gaze growing increasingly cold. He gritted his teeth, glaring at Sha Cang Mang with hatred.

“Sha… Cang… Mang…” Jin Yong Si’s heart felt like it was bleeding. His gaze locked onto Sha Cang Mang, wishing to devour him.

“Ah, Old Jin, I almost forgot to tell you something. Today my disciple encountered a fugitive from Tiger’s Prison Star and killed him. A prison enforcer even shamelessly claimed my disciple had conspired with the fugitive. What nonsense!” Sha Cang Mang smiled, raising his hand to summon a scene into the sky.

The scene depicted Luo Tian’s battle against a Three-source Immortal and a Four-source Immortal. Then, Hu Tianyun arrived and spoke with Luo Tian—every word was clear.

The people of the Divine Reckoning Continent wore expressions of awe, gazing at Luo Tian in the sky with admiration. A Three-source Immortal killing both a Three-source and Four-source Immortal—such power was already considered a prodigy. Even figures like Si Ma Qiong could not achieve this.

“Alas, Old Jin, your White Tiger Sect produced such a scoundrel. It must be a disgrace for your sect. I simply took the liberty of killing Hu Tianyun, but considering Hu Tianyun was a Seven-source Heaven Immortal of your sect, and after Master Xuanming’s persuasion, I collected his refined blood. Take it back to the White Tiger Sect for burial.”

Sha Cang Mang’s face bore satisfaction as he waved his sleeve again, sending a crimson blood sac flying toward Jin Yong Si.

“Damn it!” Jin Yong Si saw the refined blood, his face veins bulging. His aura became violent, his gaze flickering between anger and resentment toward Sha Cang Mang.

A Seven-source Heaven Immortal—his power was overwhelming. The White Tiger Sect had only four such figures, and now one had been killed by Sha Cang Mang. Jin Yong Si was heartbroken.

“Old Sha, my condolences,” Ke Zhen Tian smiled, addressing Jin Yong Si. His gaze was carefully examining Luo Tian, eyes flashing with light.

Luo Tian gazed at the four figures—Sha Cang Mang and three others—with respect. At that moment, all eyes were on Luo Tian. Not just the four masters but every person on the Divine Reckoning Continent was looking at Luo Tian, his golden Binding God’s Belt shining.

“Good work, young man. Want to consider joining my Phoenix Sect? We have plenty of female disciples!” Ke Zhen Tian smiled, his expression in Luo Tian’s eyes more like a lecherous old man.

Luo Tian’s attendants trembled behind him, unsure of what to do. They longed to descend but dared not. The pressure from the sky was immense, as so many people were watching them—each of whom could crush them effortlessly.

At that moment, hearing the Phoenix Sect’s Grand Master speaking to Luo Tian, the attendants naturally felt it. Three of the four masters had already shown considerable interest in Luo Tian, so the attendants were immune to it.

“What’s going on? The Phoenix Sect’s Grand Master is trying to lure that boy! And right in front of the Blue Dragon Sect’s Grand Master!” Others were shocked, gazing at Luo Tian.

Seeming to sense their shock, Luo Tian’s attendants felt slightly better. After all, they had performed better than others, and a sense of superiority gradually arose in their hearts.

“Apologies, but I have already joined the Blue Dragon Sect. Thank you for your kindness!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, knowing he had to play the humble disciple at this moment.

“Hmph, Ke Zhen Tian, you’re just as shameless as Jin Yong Si. Do you think I’m a decoration?” Sha Cang Mang’s face bore impatience as he addressed the two.

Seeing Sha Cang Mang about to lose his temper, the good-natured Chen Xuanning smiled: “Enough. Harmony is most important. Don’t you fear being mocked for quarreling here? Let’s start the ranking battle!”

Sha Cang Mang let out a cold hum and said no more, sitting on his chair. He sent Luo Tian’s group to the position of the Blue Dragon Sect disciples.

“Luo Tian!” Si Ma Qiong was now clearly the leader of the Blue Dragon Sect’s young disciples. Seeing Luo Tian and his group descend, he smiled and greeted him.

“Si Ma Brother, it’s been a while. Your cultivation has improved. Should we start a bet for this ranking battle? I’m sure it would be quite profitable!” Luo Tian smiled, joking with Si Ma Qiong.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Si Ma Qiong’s eyes flashed with intensity but then dimmed. Setting up a betting pool for the ranking battle was surely risking his life.

“First event of the ranking battle—Talismans!” As they spoke and laughed, a bell rang out. A loud voice drew everyone’s attention to the Divine Reckoning Platform.

Chapter 764: The Ranking Battle Begins

In the Four Beasts Star Domain, on the Divine Reckoning Continent, a heavy bell rang out. The entire continent’s people turned their gazes toward the towering Divine Reckoning Platform. Four masters stood there, each with different expressions—none could fathom what they were thinking.

“Rules are self-explanatory. The first event is talismans. Any sect participating in the talisman competition, please come up to the platform!” An old man spoke loudly from the center of the platform.

“Senior Brother Si Ma, can I do it?” A young disciple from the Blue Dragon Sect wore hesitation on his face as he addressed Si Ma Qiong.

“Do your best. After all, our sect isn’t known for talismans!” Si Ma Qiong smiled encouragingly and patted the young disciple’s shoulder.

Luo Tian looked at the youth. His memory of this disciple was shallow. The youth was a One-source Immortal, his face still somewhat youthful.

“Such a young one already at One-source Immortality. This disciple’s future is boundless!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

“Come on, come on…” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples shouted encouragement at the youth. However, their confidence in him was clearly low.

Seeming to be influenced by the encouragement, the youth nodded firmly and flew up onto the platform.

Four Seven-source Heaven Immortals appeared in the sky. Their hands moved slightly, and countless restrictions surrounded the platform.

The contestants were instantly sealed within a restriction.

“Begin!” The old man spoke, announcing the start of the competition.

As his words fell, countless glows flickered. The platform was filled with colorful lights. Various colors of original energy appeared in people’s perceptions.

“This match has little hope. I can at least win second place in refining. As for formations and alchemy, alas, if Jiang Sixi were here, it would be different!” Si Ma Qiong’s face bore a bitter expression.

The ranking battle rules were simple—divided into five events: talismans, refining, formations, alchemy, and combat. Each sect could send one participant per event. The first place would receive ten points, with subsequent rankings accordingly. Only the top ten were selected.

The final event was combat, requiring each sect to send three participants. It was the most crucial test of a sect’s disciples’ strength, with first place receiving fifty points. The top fifty were selected.

Each of the four sects had their specialties—Blue Dragon Sect disciples excelled in alchemy, White Tiger Sect in formations, Phoenix Sect in talismans, and Tortoise Sect in refining.

Other sects had strong individuals but the top four had never been challenged. The final event was what decided the rankings of the four sects.

However, this year was different. Jiang Sixi, the Blue Dragon Sect’s most skilled alchemist, had not come. Thus, the Blue Dragon Sect might lose its first place in alchemy, significantly affecting their final results.

Time slowly passed. After half a day under the expectant gazes of Luo Tian and others, the glows on the platform finally faded.

Golden light burst forth. A golden beam shot out from each small restriction, making many people squint.

“Activate your talismans!” The six-source Heaven Immortal elder spoke softly to the contestants.

The disciples dared not delay. They all activated their talismans, and immediately a thunderous sound echoed across the platform, filling it with dazzling martial arts.

Among them, the four sects’ contestants stood out. The Blue Dragon Sect, White Tiger Sect, Phoenix Sect, and Tortoise Sect disciples soared into the sky, letting out fierce roars that startled people.

Si Ma Qiong stood among the crowd and shook his head lightly. The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore disappointment, watching the four divine beasts’ illusions. Clearly, the Phoenix Sect’s talismans were stronger, while the White Tiger Sect was slightly weaker. Then came the Tortoise Sect, and finally the Blue Dragon Sect.

The elder nodded lightly. He moved his hands slightly, sending beams of light onto the ten people. Then four Heaven Immortals again moved to transport everyone out of the platform.

“Fourth place,” Luo Tian sighed lightly, watching the disappointed contestant.

In the eyes of the four sects, other sects didn’t exist. Their opponents were only each other. Fourth place meant the Blue Dragon Sect was last, earning seven points. The Phoenix Sect earned ten points. People recorded the scores of the top ten sects.

“Second event: Refining!” The elder’s voice rang out. Si Ma Qiong comforted the contestant and smiled as he stepped onto the platform.

“Senior Brother Si Ma, wait!” Luo Tian lightly patted Si Ma Qiong’s shoulder, smiling.

“Hm?” Seeing Luo Tian stop him, Si Ma Qiong turned with confusion toward Luo Tian.

“Take this!” Luo Tian extended his hand, patting Si Ma Qiong’s back. A scorching warmth appeared in the Blue Dragon Sect disciples’ perception.

The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore puzzled expressions, gazing at Luo Tian and Si Ma Qiong. However, the scorching warmth vanished instantly, returning to normal. The Blue Dragon Sect disciples shouted: “Senior Brother Si Ma, good luck!”

Si Ma Qiong’s refining skills were relatively reassuring to the Blue Dragon Sect disciples. They even believed Si Ma Qiong had a chance to compete for first place with the Tortoise Sect.

Si Ma Qiong’s face, however, bore a joyous expression. He gazed at Luo Tian and nodded heavily.

Under the distribution of four Heaven Immortals, Si Ma Qiong and thousands of others dispersed into their respective restrictions.

Alchemy required a furnace. Refining was more complicated. Si Ma Qiong waved his hand, and the sound of clattering echoed. Various forging tools appeared in Luo Tian’s view.

Flames rose, similar to alchemy, requiring flame refinement. Everyone summoned their flames with expressions of concentration.

The intense heat even made people outside the restrictions feel uncomfortable.

“Phoenix’s Life Flame!” A phoenix cry echoed, making people surprised. They gazed at the Phoenix Sect disciple’s flame.

“Hmph!” The Tortoise Sect disciple saw the phoenix’s flame on the Phoenix Sect disciple and let out a slight scoff. Whether it was jealousy or disdain, he waved his hand and used only ordinary original energy.

“Hum…” A greenish-blue flame made Si Ma Qiong’s face slightly cold. He bore admiration, gazing at the greenish-blue flame in his hand.

Bijin Lilu Fire—this was the fire Luo Tian had previously implanted into Si Ma Qiong’s body, allowing him to temporarily use it for added security.

“Hm?” Seeing Si Ma Qiong’s flame was no worse than his, the Phoenix Sect disciple’s face slightly changed. He had originally planned to win second place with the Phoenix Life Flame, but now Si Ma Qiong had revealed Bijin Lilu Fire, leaving him unprepared.

The most pitiful was the White Tiger Sect disciple. His technique was inferior to the Tortoise Sect, and his flame was weaker than both the Blue Dragon Sect and Phoenix Sect.

“Clang clang!” While people were stunned, the Tortoise Sect disciple had already raised his hammer and begun to strike fiercely.

“Tortoise Forging Heaven Hammer!” People’s faces bore shock, gazing at the hammer in the Tortoise Sect disciple’s hand. They shouted loudly.

“The Tortoise Forging Heaven Hammer, the Tortoise Sect’s sacred treasure! I didn’t expect it to be used in this competition!”

“Perhaps feeling the pressure from the Phoenix Sect and Blue Dragon Sect using two ancestral flames,” people murmured, their gazes filled with admiration toward the four sects’ participants.

Everyone skillfully began to refine, and immediately a thunderous sound echoed across the platform.

Refining took longer than talismans. After three days, the Tortoise Sect disciple was the first to complete his work, raising his hand. A blue sword appeared in people’s view.

A wave of ocean sounds echoed, and gentle water attribute original energy rose from the sword. People’s faces bore excitement.

“Tian-level High-Grade! The Tortoise Sect’s refining is truly unparalleled!” People exclaimed in amazement.

“Roar…” A dragon roar echoed, drawing people’s attention to Si Ma Qiong. He held a spear in his hand, and a green dragon illusion soared into the sky. People were surprised to see the dragon illusion carried a slight scorching heat, diving downward and entering the silver spear.

“Tian-level Mid-Grade! Senior Brother Si Ma, your strength!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore great joy, gazing at Si Ma Qiong on the platform.

At the same time, red flames roared from the Phoenix Sect. A phoenix formed and circled above the disciple’s head, diving downward into a red bow in his hand.

“Also Tian-level Mid-Grade!” People’s gazes bore admiration.

Numerous cries echoed, and countless illusions appeared in people’s view. It took half a day before everything calmed down.

“Tortoise Sect first place, Blue Dragon Sect second place, Phoenix Sect third place, White Tiger Sect fourth place…” The elder announced the results. Si Ma Qiong’s figure appeared before the Blue Dragon Sect disciples, and he sighed inwardly. If it weren’t for Luo Tian’s fire, he might have been surpassed by the Phoenix Sect.

“This ranking battle is truly more exciting each year!” The four masters nodded slightly.

“Next event: Alchemy.” After handling everything, the elder stepped onto the platform. His voice rang out again.

Hearing the master’s words, Si Ma Qiong wore a bitter expression. He shook his head lightly and scanned the crowd. Jiang Sixi was nowhere to be seen.

“Alchemy! This is so fast! Jiang Sister hasn’t come yet!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore anxious expressions.

Chapter 765: Let Me Try

“Disciples from all sects participating in the alchemy competition, please come to the Divine Reckoning Platform!” An old voice rang out. People’s gazes became intense.

Alchemy was always more watched than other events, as anyone who cultivated would never leave alchemy. Alchemists were revered even in the Four Beasts Star Domain.

Each alchemy competition was closely watched, especially by sects outside the four. They focused on the results of the alchemy competition and those who performed well in it.

The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore bitter expressions. In previous years, the alchemy competition was one they never worried about. But this year, their representative alchemist Jiang Sixi had not participated, causing the Blue Dragon Sect disciples to fear greatly.

Si Ma Qiong scanned the crowd. Finally, he noticed a young nine-grade alchemist from the Blue Dragon Sect. This disciple was a Heaven Immortal of the sect, with high alchemy skills.

“Ji Yan Xing. Why don’t you try?” Si Ma Qiong sighed, his voice not too tense.

“Me?” Ji Yan Xing shook his head like a drum. Others might not know, but he did—what was the strength of the other three sects’ alchemists?

The Phoenix Sect’s terrifying Ke Xin Die. Besides Jiang Sixi, who could suppress her? And the Tortoise Sect’s Shang Jing Hong. Ji Yan Xing knew both had just entered Imperial-grade alchemists. Not to mention the White Tiger Sect’s alchemist, who was a well-known veteran. If he went up, there was no chance at all.

“You don’t go, then who will? Do you want me, the blacksmith gambler, to go up?” Si Ma Qiong had discussed with Ji Yan Xing for a while. Ji Yan Xing refused stubbornly.

Alchemists were proud and never wanted to be inferior. Ji Yan Xing didn’t want to go up and lose, being humiliated by the three.

“Then I’ll try,” a calm voice echoed in Si Ma Qiong’s ears. He was startled and turned, his face filled with suspicion toward Luo Tian.

The golden Binding God’s Belt fluttered in the wind. Luo Tian stood there, arms crossed, his gaze toward Si Ma Qiong.

“Luo Tian can refine alchemy?” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore puzzled expressions toward Luo Tian.

However, Luo Tian’s attendants felt exhilarated. Others might not know, but those who had guarded Luo Tian’s residence night and day knew he could refine alchemy. Jiang Sixi hadn’t left yet, but they often heard Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi discussing alchemy. They would argue until their faces turned red.

“Master, let Luo Tian try,” Zhang Qing Sheng naturally knew Luo Tian could refine alchemy. He spoke hesitantly to Si Ma Qiong.

“Luo Brother, do you have confidence?” Si Ma Qiong finally asked.

“Let’s try. I can’t guarantee anything else, but refining an Imperial-grade elixir should be possible,” Luo Tian spoke softly. His words made the Blue Dragon Sect disciples shocked.

“Good!” Si Ma Qiong sighed, knowing Luo Tian wasn’t boasting. He nodded slightly.

Luo Tian flew onto the Divine Reckoning Platform. His spiritual sense surveyed around. Since he arrived late, the platform was already full.

Someone saw Luo Tian standing on the platform and wore suspicion. The golden Binding God’s Belt was unusually eye-catching. Anyone with a little knowledge would know it symbolized the status of an attendant from the Blue Dragon Sect.

“Where is Jiang Sixi? Didn’t she dare come?” A woman’s voice rang in Luo Tian’s ears. He was startled.

“Phoenix Sect?” Luo Tian turned to find the source of the voice, seeing a woman in red Phoenix Sect attire.

“Phoenix Sect’s Ke Xin Die!” Ji Yan Xing, standing before Si Ma Qiong, had a twitching face. He looked at the fiery little chili pepper-like Ke Xin Die.

“Is this the one who has always been suppressed by Jiang Sister?” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore understanding expressions.

Among the four sects’ alchemists, Jiang Sixi was recognized as the top young talent. Ke Xin Die had good talent but had always been suppressed by Jiang Sixi. This time, she entered Imperial-grade alchemy to prove herself as the top of the Four Beasts Star Domain. But she hadn’t expected her ranking battle to arrive, only to find an attendant from the Blue Dragon Sect.

Although Sha Cang Mang had previously played a video of Luo Tian killing two from Tiger’s Prison Star, which drew everyone's attention, it didn’t mean Luo Tian had a high status in people’s minds. An attendant was an attendant, and that would never change. They could never be looked down upon by these root-true direct disciples.

Luo Tian always chose to ignore such people, never paying attention to the lofty Ke Xin Die.

“Blue Dragon Sect really has no one left! Sending an attendant for this competition. This is too disrespectful!” Yang Feiyang, the White Tiger Sect’s alchemist, wore disdainful expressions toward Luo Tian.

As for Shang Jing Hong of the Tortoise Sect, he smiled foolishly and waited for the master to announce the start.

“This time, Blue Dragon Sect’s alchemy competition is strange. Sending an attendant—this is nonsense! Where is Jiang Sixi?” Some people who knew about Jiang Sixi began to discuss why she wasn’t in the Blue Dragon Sect.

“Begin!” As people discussed, the elder’s voice rang out in Luo Tian and others’ ears. Everyone was startled, their gazes filled with anticipation toward the alchemists on the platform, hoping for a dark horse.

“Hum…” Ke Xin Die wore disdain. She summoned her alchemy cauldron. This competition, without Jiang Sixi, she would definitely shine. In her eyes, no one was her opponent.

Yang Feiyang of the White Tiger Sect also let out a light laugh. The White Tiger Sect was least skilled in alchemy, always the bottom. This time, Blue Dragon Sect had sent Luo Tian, so he should be able to suppress him and get third place—good enough.

Luo Tian habitually sat on the ground, adjusting his state. This was his alchemy habit over the years—never changed.

“Blue Dragon Sect really is giving up on the alchemy competition! This year’s ranking battle is unfavorable for Blue Dragon Sect!” People saw Luo Tian’s situation and shook their heads lightly.

“Ah, that boy. Are you Jiang Sixi’s hired jester? Don’t you have an alchemy cauldron? Let me give you one!” Ke Xin Die spoke calmly, full of mockery. But she received only Luo Tian’s silence.

“Daring to ignore me! Daring to ignore me! I’ll show you when the strength competition begins!” Ke Xin Die gritted her teeth and began to refine herbs.

People watched this alchemy competition, observing each alchemist’s refining techniques. Their faces bore a trance.

Half a day passed quietly. Some had already entered the stage of refining elixirs, but Luo Tian still sat on the ground. His mind was empty.

“Luo Tian is doing what? Why hasn’t he started refining elixirs yet?” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore anxious expressions.

Time passed slowly. Another hour went by, and Luo Tian finally opened his eyes with a smile. He extended his hand, summoning the Soul-Subduing Cauldron before him, emitting a warm feeling.

“Master Zhao, I’m sorry!” Greenish-blue flames shot from Luo Tian’s hand into the fire mouth. His熟练ly performed thousand-page拂丹 hands, placing herbs one by one into the cauldron.

Luo Tian’s resources were terrifying. Previously, he had emptied the Great An Forest. Although many people from the Tianyuan Continent used it, there were still plenty left. Plus the resources of the Blue Dragon Sect, Luo Tian now had countless medicinal herbs.

One by one, the medicinal herbs with residual shadows were placed into the cauldron. The Blue Dragon Sect disciples’ eyes lit up.

Experts saw the details, while outsiders watched the spectacle. The Blue Dragon Sect disciples saw Luo Tian’s techniques and knew he was quite good.

Ji Yan Xing, standing before Si Ma Qiong, had a face full of light watching Luo Tian’s techniques. He was clearly an experienced alchemist. Just by this technique, Ji Yan Xing knew Luo Tian was much stronger than him.

“Chance!” Ji Yan Xing whispered, his eyes filled with anticipation. The Blue Dragon Sect disciples’ expressions were shocked again.

“Ten… a hundred…” Hundreds of medicinal herbs were thrown into the cauldron by Luo Tian in just one hour.

Another half-day passed. Luo Tian had already refined hundreds of herbs into liquid medicine.

Luo Tian finally entered the stage of refining elixirs. His powerful spiritual sense wrapped around the liquid medicine, carefully combining it.

The Divine Reckoning Platform was unusually quiet. All alchemists were watching their cauldrons intently, all entering the stage of refining elixirs. The aroma of medicine continuously drifted out, making everyone’s minds stunned. Yet no one dared to speak, all focusing their attention on the alchemists on the platform.

Time passed swiftly. Seven days later, the platform finally made a sound, startling people’s minds and drawing their gazes toward the source.

“It’s the Phoenix Sect!” People saw, Ke Xin Die wore a proud expression. She struck her cauldron with her hand, producing a dull sound.

“Hum…” Original energy from the world rushed toward Ke Xin Die’s cauldron, as if someone had broken through their cultivation.

A massive original energy formed a phoenix illusion and rushed into Ke Xin Die’s cauldron.

“Come out!” Ke Xin Die smiled confidently, striking her hand again. The lid of the cauldron flew off. At the same time, a thunderous sound echoed above Ke Xin Die’s head.

Phoenix cries rang out. A red elixir, like a phoenix, soared into the sky, proudly looking at the thunderstorm about to fall.

“Primordial Thunder!” Feeling the power of the thunderstorm in the sky, the four masters’ faces slightly changed. They hadn’t expected Ke Xin Die’s elixir to summon Primordial Thunder.

Chapter 766: Jiang Sixi Returns

The Divine Reckoning Platform roared. Ke Xin Die, in red, like a proud phoenix, wore a confident expression. She gazed at the red elixir in the sky and the Primordial Thunder gathering above.

The people around wore expressions of awe, gazing at the elixir in the sky. If it passed through the Primordial Thunder, it would be fully refined.

“Unexpectedly, this short time, Ke Xin Die has improved a lot!” A figure appeared on the Divine Reckoning Continent. He wore a calm expression, his golden Binding God’s Belt fluttering in the wind. His body radiated powerful fluctuations.

He passed through the crowd, calm and composed, appearing behind the Blue Dragon Sect disciples. At first, no one noticed this figure. But after the outermost disciples saw it, their faces bore disbelief and then joy, unable to help but shout: “Senior Jiang!”

“Senior Jiang? Which Senior Jiang?” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples all turned confused, but then their faces wore joy.

Jiang Sixi, the Blue Dragon Sect’s young generation’s number one talent. After being absent for half a year, she had finally appeared in people’s sight during the ranking battle.

“Senior Jiang!” Si Ma Qiong wore joy, his heart suddenly relieved. Before Jiang Sixi returned, he had arranged everything himself. Now that she was back, he could relax a bit.

“Unfortunately, Senior Jiang didn’t arrive in time for the alchemy competition. If she had participated, this Phoenix Sect’s Ke Xin Die wouldn’t have been so arrogant!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore disappointment.

He passed through the crowd. Jiang Sixi walked to the front of the crowd, near the Divine Reckoning Platform. Her appearance caused a big commotion in the Blue Dragon Sect and other sects. The top talents of the four sects all wore battle intent, gazing at Jiang Sixi. Upon seeing her head tied with a golden Binding God’s Belt, their faces all bore shock.

“What's going on? Why does Senior Jiang have a Binding God’s Belt!”

“Blue Dragon Sect’s number one talent became an attendant. Who could have such treatment? Who is Senior Jiang's master?” The disciples of the four sects were shocked, gazing at Jiang Sixi with a calm expression. They all guessed who the great person was who had taken Jiang Sixi as an attendant, which exceeded people's understanding.

“Crack…” As people thought, a dull thunderous sound rang out from the platform. People’s gazes returned to the Divine Reckoning Platform.

Gray Primordial Thunder, carrying a shocking fluctuation, rushed toward Ke Xin Die’s elixir. People felt trembling.

“This time, the alchemy competition has no second or third place—only one winner!” Ke Xin Die’s beautiful face bore arrogance. She pointed her finger.

Four-color original energy burst from her body, forming four streams of light that rushed into the red elixir.

“Hum…” As the four-color original energy entered, the elixir in the sky seemed to gain sentience. It transformed into a phoenix again, letting out a series of cries.

“Boom… boom…” As the cries rang out, other people’s cauldrons emitted a series of thunderous sounds. Some even exploded.

“Damn it! It’s affecting our minds!” A disciple from another sect whose cauldron exploded wore anger, gazing at the arrogant Ke Xin Die.

“Xin Die’s girl is overdoing it!” Chen Xuanning sat on the Tortoise seat, his eyebrows slightly furrowed. He clearly didn’t approve of Ke Xin Die’s actions.

“Her strength isn’t enough, so she blames others!” Ke Zhen Tian wore a smile, satisfied with Ke Xin Die.

At that moment, except for the four sects’ four alchemists, all other disciples’ cauldrons emitted a series of cracks. Finally, they turned into grass and wood energy that soared into the sky toward the red elixir.

“Damn it!” Yang Feiyang’s face bore anger. He felt his cauldron's elixir trembling constantly, desperately controlling it from exploding. But in the end, it emitted a thunderous sound, lifting the cauldron’s lid and sending out powerful grass and wood energy toward the phoenix already solidified in the sky.

Shang Jing Hong of the Tortoise Sect wore a bitter smile. His cauldron also roared, and grass and wood energy flew out, flowing into the phoenix’s body.

“This alchemy competition has only one winner. The Phoenix Sect’s Ke Xin Die, never before in history has such a result appeared!” People below the Divine Reckoning Platform discussed.

Ke Xin Die wore an arrogant expression, her gaze slightly raised. She looked at the Blue Dragon Sect and collided with Jiang Sixi’s gaze, full of mockery.

“Mock me? It's too early!” Jiang Sixi smiled, gazing at a weak figure on the Divine Reckoning Platform.

“Luo Tian!” As Jiang Sixi’s gaze, the Blue Dragon Sect disciples wore great joy, gazing at Luo Tian standing there with a calm expression.

Other people’s elixirs all exploded, but Luo Tian’s cauldron had no sound at all. Obviously unaffected by Ke Xin Die’s elixir.

This situation made the Blue Dragon Sect disciples happy. If Luo Tian refined an elixir, he would be second place directly. Because besides Ke Xin Die and Luo Tian, no one on the Divine Reckoning Platform had refined an elixir.

“Give yours out too!” Seeing no movement from Luo Tian, Ke Xin Die frowned slightly. Her face bore annoyance. She pointed her finger, and the phoenix in the sky let out another cry. A powerful fluctuation rushed toward Luo Tian’s cauldron.
