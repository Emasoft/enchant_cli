“Don’t sell…” Hearing Fang Zhengyang’s words, others’ faces all showed rare anticipation, hoping Luo Tian wouldn’t sell the Dragon Eye Crystal. In that case, they still had a chance.

“Forgive me, but I cannot sell this Dragon Eye Crystal. I have great use for it!” Luo Tian lightly shook his head, directly refusing. This was an item the sect coveted; Luo Tian wouldn’t part with it.

“Fine, but when you decide to sell, feel free to find us. Also, our master wishes to ask you a favor. If you have time, come to the Jade Carving Workshop—we’ll consider it an obligation owed to you. The favor of our Jade Carving Workshop isn’t something just anyone can obtain!” Seeing Luo Tian’s refusal, Fang Zhengyang showed no surprise. He spoke again to Luo Tian.

“What favor?” Luo Tian’s brows slightly arched. He sensed the Jade Carving Workshop’s power extended far beyond Luan Tian City. If he could gain their favor, it would be advantageous.

“This favor is relatively easy for you to accomplish. It merely requires borrowing your Dragon Eye Crystal. As for when… we’ll find you ourselves!” Fang Zhengyang’s face showed a faint smile.

“Very well. I’ll use this favor now. My younger sister—please let her stay for a while. After some time, I’ll send her to the Tianmen Sect!” Luo Tian nodded, his interest in the Jade Carving Workshop growing. He accepted.

“This matter, young master may rest assured. We’ll ensure the girl’s safety!” Fang Zhengyang didn’t hesitate to agree.

Luo Tian saw no further issues and said goodbye to Long Youlan before heading toward the Jade Carving Workshop’s exit. As he walked, waves of energy surged toward his Dragon Eye Crystal, prompting a cold smile on Luo Tian’s face. Over twenty imprints marked his body, and dozens of presences followed him.

“Those who wish to take what’s mine should prepare themselves!” Luo Tian mentally scoffed, dismissing them entirely.

Soon after, Luo Tian exited the Jade Carving Workshop. The people inside continued their tasks as if nothing had happened.

“Master, what do we do?” Wang Tianlong and Yao Qishui stared at each other in disbelief.

“He’s out of the Jade Carving Workshop. That means he’s no longer in control!” Yao Qishui muttered, his face twisted with hatred as he watched Luo Tian leave.

“Go kill him. I’ll return to Luan Tian Mountain and await you!” Yao Qishui mentally instructed Wang Tianlong. After all, Luo Tian was a Tianmen Sect disciple; he couldn’t openly assassinate him. He could only teach him a lesson, but even that failed to satisfy Yao Qishui’s resentment.

Moreover, Luo Tian now possessed two Dragon Eye Crystals. Yao Qishui couldn’t ignore them—those crystals were for his grandfather’s breakthrough to True Immortal. Once his grandfather ascended, all problems would vanish.

“Yes!” Hearing Yao Qishui’s mental command, Wang Tianlong’s eyes flashed with cruelty. He vanished from sight.

Luo Tian smiled coldly, deciding not to return to the inn. He had no concern for Long Youlan’s safety; the rest was to visit Luan Tian Sect and confirm if the Ascendant was someone he knew. If so, he’d do everything to save them.

Luan Tian Sect lay within half a day’s journey for Luo Tian. Yet he didn’t rush, giving those behind ample time to catch up.

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian walked a rarely traveled path, his face curled in mockery. He then turned, softly saying: “Your speed is truly slow!”

Luo Tian sensed the distance between himself and his pursuers. He stopped, waiting for them to arrive.

“Kid, I didn’t expect you to dare take this path and even rest. If I were you, I’d have run as far as possible!” After waiting half a bell, a cruel laugh accompanied by the sound of breaking air rose from above.

Above, a middle-aged man stood, clad in gray robes. His eyes flickered with gray energy, radiating the aura of a mid-True Immortal.

“Hand over that Dragon Eye Crystal and I’ll spare your life!” The man spoke, standing above Luo Tian with a condescending gaze.

“Buzz…” Before the man’s words had finished, the sound of breaking air suddenly erupted. Light streaked through the sky as figures appeared above, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian rising slowly.

“Kid, hand over the Dragon Eye Crystal!” A chorus of commands echoed. Over thirty people stood there, their auras exuding immense pressure.

“Ten mid-True Immortals and over twenty early-True Immortals? Do you think you can demand my Dragon Eye Crystal?” Luo Tian assessed their strength, scanning them.

“Kid, don’t use your Tianmen Sect identity to intimidate me. That title means nothing to me!” The initial man sneered.

“Tianmen Sect disciples? I’ve always used fists to dominate. Since you’re here, none of you will leave alive!” Luo Tian laughed loudly and leapt into the air, facing them.

“Haha… Kid, do you think you’re someone? Do you plan to kill all of us?” The thirty people sneered.

“Wouldn’t have chased me if I weren’t broke!” Luo Tian coldly replied, his feet pressing into the void. He vanished from sight.

“Fast!” Everyone’s eyes flickered, then a scream echoed in their ears.

“Boom…” Blood splattered as Luo Tian materialized before the first man, punching his heart.

Crushing. Luo Tian’s current strength utterly dominated mid-True Immortals. The man couldn’t react, being crushed by a single punch.

Shock spread among all. This man was known—a notorious killer who had slain many sect disciples and even a disciple of the Tie Men Sect. Yet he was killed by a single punch.

“Didn’t they say Luo Tian was only early-True Immortal?” Next, everyone trembled in fear. Especially the early-True Immortals; Luo Tian’s power had completely annihilated them.

“Attack together and kill him!” A mid-True Immortal commanded. This man was their strongest; if Luo Tian picked them off one by one, they had no chance.

“Good…” Others naturally agreed. Luo Tian’s power had shocked them all.

“Lingyun Hand…”

“Huo Fire Blade…” As they spoke, martial arts techniques surged from their hands, rushing toward Luo Tian and engulfing him.

“Unexpectedly, that kid has ascended to mid-True Immortal. And so terrifying!”

“Still, it’s a pity. Facing so many, eventually both sides would be destroyed. It’s better for me to profit from this!” Wang Tianlong had been lurking in the shadows, his face sneering. Unlike these ruthless men, he couldn’t openly kill Luo Tian.

“Back then in Tianmen City, you were so high and mighty. Now why are you so timid?” As Wang Tianlong mused, planning to strike after they fought Luo Tian nearly to death, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in his ears. Luo Tian materialized behind him like a ghost.

“Oops!” At the sound, Wang Tianlong’s face instantly changed. He swung his hand, throwing a punch behind him.

“Crack…” Wang Tianlong’s reaction was quick, but his strength paled against Luo Tian’s. A crisp sound echoed repeatedly as Wang Tianlong’s arm snapped apart at an alarming speed.

“Boom…” A golden fist smashed through Wang Tianlong’s arm, then struck his shoulder.

“Puke…” Wang Tianlong’s face turned pale. His body appeared in sight.

Chapter 1852: Ascend to Luan Tian

“Is it Wang Tianlong!” People saw Wang Tianlong’s figure, exclaiming. Then they saw Luo Tian standing in the sky, unharmed.

“Did he dodge our attack or endure it!” People murmured, unsure how Luo Tian had done it.

“Boom…” A golden foot descended, crushing Wang Tianlong’s body. This time, Wang Tianlong wasn’t so lucky; he was shattered by the golden foot, blood splattering on the ground.

“Kill…” Luo Tian roared, like a tiger descending from the mountain, rushing toward the stunned people.

“Run!” Facing such a Luo Tian, they had no will to fight. In so short a time, he’d killed two mid-True Immortals with three moves. None could withstand him; even their combined attack was neutralized by Luo Tian.

“None of you will escape!” Luo Tian sneered, his aura surging and enveloping them. He waved his hand, and three wolves and the Wolf King howled out.

Screams echoed. In a moment, plus Wang Tianlong, thirty people died, their limbs and bodies scattered on the ground.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian waved his hand, collecting rings into his grasp.

“Go!” Luo Tian sneered, then soared into the sky toward Luan Tian Mountain.

……

Luan Tian Sect was one of the larger sects in the Lower Heavens. Its strength naturally surpassed Zhenxian Sect. A vast mountain gate stood on the hillside, with countless peaks rising. The sect had nearly a million disciples. It could be said without exaggeration that, without the three major sects, Luan Tian Sect would qualify as a major one.

At that moment, two elders in the sect’s hall smiled and conversed. A group of Luan Tian Sect elders sat below, also smiling.

“Master Duan, by all rights, we should deliver this personally. However, the Ascendant is significant; I dare not send it. Please excuse me for troubling you!”

“This is a small gift from my side; please accept it as an apology!” A middle-aged man smiled, addressing another.

The speaking man was Luan Tian Sect’s Grand Elder Guan Hongsheng, a True Immortal peak. Opposite him stood Duan Chengfeng, who had escaped Luo Tian’s grasp earlier.

“Haha, Grand Elder Guan, you’re too kind. Taking a stroll is quite pleasant!” Duan Chengfeng smiled, pocketing the ring.

Though Duan Chengfeng was a Tianmen Sect elder, he showed no arrogance before Guan Hongsheng. He knew Guan Hongsheng valued his Tianmen Sect elder status.

“Come, Master Duan. When you ascend to the Middle Heavens, don’t forget our Lower Heavens Luan Tian Sect!” Guan Hongsheng smiled more broadly. If the Tianmen Sect succeeded in their ascension, Luan Tian Sect would inevitably become a major sect in the Lower Heavens.

If the Tianmen Sect solidified their position in the Middle Heavens, Luan Tian Sect would have a valuable ally during their ascension.

“Master Duan, it’s truly timely that you came. I recently captured a dragon. This time, I specially cut some of its meat for Master Duan to taste!” Guan Hongsheng smiled, waving his hand.

Several disciples carried a large pot into the hall. Boiling water swirled within, and a golden dragon tail writhed in it. A strange aura radiated from the pot, making Duan Chengfeng’s face shift.

“This dragon isn’t ordinary. I didn’t expect Grand Elder Guan to have such a chance!” Duan Chengfeng’s face slightly tensed. A dragon meat that could make him feel an aura was rare.

“That’s not all. Though this dragon was only early-True Immortal, I captured it with great effort—chasing it three million miles before catching it alive. However, it was fierce and refused to submit. I still have it caged!” Guan Hongsheng smiled proudly, his eyes glowing at the thought of the dragon.

“Grand Elder Guan is too kind!” Duan Chengfeng smiled, then continued chatting with Guan Hongsheng, waiting for the dragon meat to cook.

“Report, Grand Elder. A young man claiming to be a Tianmen Sect disciple is requesting an audience!” As they waited, a disciple entered the hall, respectfully addressing Guan Hongsheng.

“A Tianmen Sect disciple?” Hearing the report, Guan Hongsheng’s brows slightly furrowed. Duan Chengfeng’s body slightly paused.

“Perhaps he’s a disciple on training!” Duan Chengfeng kept his expression neutral. He wouldn’t admit he was nearly killed by Luo Tian.

“Bring him in!” Guan Hongsheng smiled slightly, addressing the disciple.

“Yes!” The disciple bowed and walked out of the hall.

Not long after, the disciple arrived at Luan Tian Sect’s gate and approached Luo Tian waiting there.

“Follow me!” The disciple addressed Luo Tian, smiling. After all, this man was a Tianmen Sect disciple; the disciple dared not offend him.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded, glancing at the setting sun. He followed the disciple into the hall.

Luo Tian had timed his arrival carefully. He dared not come openly during the day; with their relationship, he’d be dead if he did. But at night was different—Luo Tian had many methods, and he was confident in escaping from Luan Tian Sect.

Walking through the peaks, Luo Tian wore a faint smile. However, his vast spiritual sense spread outward, hoping to find familiar energy.

But he soon became disappointed. Luan Tian Sect seemed to have some method; his spiritual sense was disrupted the moment it spread.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. However, as he reached a peak, his wrist emitted waves, making his face change instantly.

“Nirvana Dragon Seal. Could it be Long Jie!” Luo Tian’s mind stirred, gazing at the peak, clenching his fists.

“Brother, what place is that peak? I feel a fierce aura!” Luo Tian smiled, asking the disciple.

“Ah, that’s where we cage beasts of hell. It houses a group of animals!” The disciple dared not offend the Tianmen Sect disciple, answering casually.

“Animals!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with intense killing intent. He gazed at the peak, not acting rashly but following the disciple.

Hearing the disciple’s tone, he knew Luan Tian Sect treated Long Jie poorly. After all, to them, it was just an animal.

Soon after, the disciple led Luo Tian to the hall where Duan Chengfeng and Guan Hongsheng were. After reporting, Luo Tian was allowed entry.

Upon entering the hall, Luo Tian saw a large pot boiling with water. Steam and aroma filled the air, along with roaring sounds from the pot.

“Long Jie!” Luo Tian’s eyes instantly turned red. He could sense whose aura was in the pot.

“Luo Tian!” As Luo Tian clenched his fists tightly, a command echoed in his ears. Duan Chengfeng sat there with a smile, gazing at Luo Tian standing there.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s brows slightly furrowed, then he quickly regained composure. He met Duan Chengfeng’s gaze.

“Respect Master!” Seeing Duan Chengfeng showed no intention of confronting him, Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with a smile. He stepped toward Duan Chengfeng.

“Hmph…” Duan Chengfeng sighed slightly, speaking to Luo Tian: “Alright, since you’ve come, step forward and broaden your horizons!”

“Luo Tian?” Hearing Duan Chengfeng call his name, the atmosphere in the hall slightly stilled. All eyes focused on Luo Tian.

“You are Luo Tian?” Next, a middle-aged man stood up abruptly, gazing at Luo Tian with cold killing intent.

“Correct. Tianmen Sect disciple, Luo Tian. Greetings to Grand Elder!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, emphasizing the words “Tianmen Sect.”

“Buzz…” Next, the man stood up and extended his hand. A spiritual energy shot from it toward Luo Tian.

“Mid-True Immortal, dare to provoke me?” Luo Tian mentally sneered. However, seeing the pot, his mind slightly stirred, as if he hadn’t felt the man’s spiritual energy.

“Buzz…” An invisible wave emitted a crackling sound, instantly appearing before Luo Tian. Everyone’s faces were surprised; they hadn’t expected a genius disciple to ignore such an attack.

“Explosion…” Next, an explosion echoed in the hall. Boiling water scattered everywhere.

“What happened?” Everyone’s faces showed shock. They had seen the attack hit Luo Tian, but it seemed to have been deflected onto the pot.

“Take my brother’s revenge. I, Luo Tian, will remember this!” Luo Tian’s heart filled with killing intent, but his face wore a smile. He walked behind Duan Chengfeng; no matter what, he had to see Long Jie first.

“Daring to provoke me in Luan Tian Sect!” Next, several middle-aged men stood up angrily, shouting at Luo Tian.

“Master Duan, your disciple is quite wild!” Guan Hongsheng’s eyes were deep. He lightly touched his teacup, hiding his thoughts.

Chapter 1853: Meet Long Jie

Hearing Guan Hongsheng’s words, Duan Chengfeng made a judgment. His eyes flashed with sharpness, gazing at Luo Tian behind him.

“Haha, youth is fiery. If this kid offended Grand Elder Guan, he may be taught a lesson!” Duan Chengfeng smiled.

“Teaching isn’t the point. I heard my Luan Tian Sect has a master who recently fell to this kid. I hope Master Duan can give me an explanation!” Guan Hongsheng’s eyes were deep, gazing at Duan Chengfeng.

“Two old foxes!” Luo Tian mentally sneered. Though Duan Chengfeng and Guan Hongsheng seemed polite, they clearly passed the ball to each other, hoping to let the other deal with Luo Tian.

Guan Hongsheng didn’t want to attack Luo Tian, fearing his connection to the Tianmen Sect. After all, Luo Tian had caused a stir in the Tianmen Sect before. Such a genius would draw the attention of the Tianmen Sect’s elders. If he openly killed Luo Tian, it might give others a reason to criticize him.

Duan Chengfeng, however, hoped to let Luan Tian Sect eliminate Luo Tian. The only mistake Guan Hongsheng made was not realizing Duan Chengfeng truly couldn’t kill Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, this matter is your fault. Handle it yourself!” After Guan Hongsheng and Duan Chengfeng secretly passed the ball for a while, Duan Chengfeng finally lost patience. He addressed Luo Tian, passing the ball to him.

“Grand Elder Guan, this is my mistake!” Hearing Duan Chengfeng’s words, Luo Tian’s smile never faded. He stepped forward and addressed Guan Hongsheng.

But after speaking, he retreated back behind Duan Chengfeng.

“Hmph…” Everyone was surprised. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to step forward and merely apologize before leaving.

“Kid, you killed someone and just apologized? What else do you want?” The middle-aged man who had attacked before shouted, gazing at Luo Tian with killing intent. Others’ faces also showed hostility. The hall fell silent, everyone’s eyes on Luo Tian.

“They won’t attack openly now!” Luo Tian mentally sneered but wore an innocent expression: “Everyone, what else do you want me to do? Pay money? Alright, I’ll pay!”

As he spoke, Luo Tian waved his hand and directly threw Wang Tianlong’s storage ring toward Guan Hongsheng.

“Face-licking!” The Luan Tian Sect members’ breaths became heavy. Luo Tian’s action was a blatant face-licking—killing someone and using the killer’s storage ring to pay.

Guan Hongsheng’s hand continuously rubbed his teacup, smiling but with deep eyes that seemed unreadable.

Luo Tian felt tense. Guan Hongsheng’s gaze gave him a sense of danger, as if he were prey to a hungry wolf. This feeling hadn’t crossed him in a long time.

“Luan Tian Sect’s Grand Elder isn’t simple!” Luo Tian thought. His actions were a test of Guan Hongsheng’s limits. Even if they fought, he wasn’t afraid. Though he couldn’t destroy the vast Luan Tian Sect, he could escape easily since it was night.

“Truly a young hero!” Guan Hongsheng lightly laughed, the second time he said this today.

“Alright, since you killed someone and paid compensation, let’s end it here!” Guan Hongsheng lightly laughed. Everyone’s faces showed disbelief.

“What’s going on?” All felt this question, puzzled why Guan Hongsheng would let it go. Luo Tian was a Tianmen Sect disciple, but Guan Hongsheng’s status meant killing him would be troublesome—just a hassle.

Now, the Tianmen Sect was in the critical phase of their ascension war. It wasn’t worth offending Luan Tian Sect over one disciple.

“Cunning plan!” Luo Tian felt more tense, especially seeing Guan Hongsheng’s deep gaze. He became even more wary of Guan Hongsheng.

“Alright, someone go and cut some dragon meat again. Let Master Duan and the Tianmen Sect’s prodigy taste it!” Guan Hongsheng spoke again, as if the previous conflict never existed.

“Yes!” Soon after, disciples responded and went toward the peak Luo Tian had passed earlier.

“Grand Elder Guan, I wish to see this dragon and broaden my horizons. Do you agree?” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Guan Hongsheng. Regardless of Guan Hongsheng’s plan, Luo Tian still wanted to see how Long Jie was.

Moreover, from Guan Hongsheng’s words, he again realized the Ascendant wasn’t Long Jie. After all, to them, Long Jie was just an animal; the Ascendant must be someone else.

“Since it’s a Tianmen Sect prodigy, I naturally have to grant the favor. Come on, Master Duan, are you also curious about this dragon’s appearance?” Guan Hongsheng smiled.

“Guests follow the host!” Duan Chengfeng slightly furrowed his brows, unsure of Guan Hongsheng’s plan. He nodded slightly.

They walked out of the hall, heading toward the peak where Luo Tian had passed. Along the way, Guan Hongsheng introduced Luan Tian Sect to Luo Tian and Duan Chengfeng. However, he didn’t mention any secret places.

“Roar…” Soon after, roaring sounds echoed in their ears. They reached the peak where beasts were caged.

Standing at the mountain’s base, a fierce aura radiated from the peak. Duan Chengfeng and Luo Tian slightly furrowed their brows.

“Come on!” Guan Hongsheng ignored their expressions and led Luo Tian and Duan Chengfeng up the mountain.

Along the way, countless cages appeared in their view. Each cage held beasts with fierce eyes, strange and varied.

Luo Tian and Duan Chengfeng remained calm. Luo Tian saw countless beasts but wasn’t impressed; the Tianmen Sect also had such peaks. Duan Chengfeng had seen them before.

“Roar…” However, at the mountain’s peak, roaring dragon sounds echoed. Duan Chengfeng showed interest.

After the roar, the beasts in the cages seemed ignited with fury. They all roared and their auras surged.

“Ten Thousand Beasts Submit. This dragon’s bloodline is so dense!” Duan Chengfeng showed surprise for the first time, clearly stunned.

“Definitely Long Jie!” Seeing the beasts’ reactions, Luo Tian sighed slightly. His last hope was shattered; his killing intent grew even fiercer.

Soon after, they reached the mountain’s peak. A hundred-foot-long cage appeared in their view. The cage was made of unknown material, but lightning surrounded it.

Inside the cage stood a hundred-foot-long crimson figure, lying there. Its massive dragon eyes showed weakness but constantly roared, occasionally slamming its bloodied body against the cage.

“Dragon scales removed!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned red. He saw this hundred-foot-long dragon, his heart bleeding.

“Long Jie!” Upon seeing the figure, Luo Tian immediately recognized it as Long Jie.

But this Long Jie had no trace of its former power. Its aura was weak, and its entire body was crimson. Dragon scales were all gone; even its tail had a large chunk of flesh missing, bloodied and battered.

“Guan Hongsheng. I, Luo Tian, won’t kill you. I’ll never be human!” Luo Tian mentally roared. But his face remained expressionless, gazing at Long Jie.

At the moment Luo Tian appeared, Long Jie’s dimmed dragon eyes flashed with light. It wanted to speak but didn’t open its mouth.

Luo Tian could sense the Nirvana Dragon Seal’s waves. How could Long Jie not feel it? That was why it kept roaring, hoping to draw Luo Tian’s attention. It knew Luo Tian would come for him and save it.

“Pain…” Long Jie weakly spoke. To others, it sounded like a plea for mercy. But Luo Tian knew this was only for him to understand.

Memories flowed like water. Luo Tian thought of how he had watched Long Jie grow up. Every time it was injured, it would say this word to Luo Tian, and he’d always avenge Long Jie. Now, hearing it say this word again, it struck the pain in Luo Tian’s heart.

“Five-clawed Golden Dragon. It’s a Dragon King!” Duan Chengfeng’s eyes showed disbelief, gazing at Long Jie’s five claws.

“Correct. It is a Five-clawed Golden Dragon!” Guan Hongsheng lightly laughed, his eyes flashing with excitement.

“Open my eyes. Today I’ve seen something incredible! Grand Elder Guan, with this dragon, Luan Tian Sect’s ascension to the Middle Heavens is imminent!” Duan Chengfeng showed admiration.

“Unfortunately, this dragon is wild and unyielding. No matter my threats or enticements, it wouldn’t submit!” Guan Hongsheng spoke lightly. His gaze glanced at Duan Chengfeng, then subtly at Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s eyes paused. He felt Guan Hongsheng’s gaze at him, which was subtly meaningful.

“Since Master Duan has arrived today, you may try to subdue it. If successful, I’ll personally gift this dragon to Master Duan!” Guan Hongsheng addressed Duan Chengfeng.

“Madness!”

“Grand Elder must have gone mad!” Hearing Guan Hongsheng’s words, everyone felt this thought. First, he let Luo Tian go; then he was giving a Dragon King to Duan Chengfeng. Giving favors this way was absurd.

“Grand Elder Guan, are you sure?” Duan Chengfeng also couldn’t believe. Why would Guan Hongsheng be so kind to give a Dragon King to him?

Chapter 1854: Subdue

Everyone gazed at Guan Hongsheng, surprised he would so generously give a dragon for Duan Chengfeng’s favor.

“Haha, thank you Grand Elder! I’ll try!” Duan Chengfeng laughed loudly. His eyes showed joy. If he could obtain this Dragon King, his position in the Tianmen Sect would soar.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He felt Guan Hongsheng was testing him, perhaps to see if he could subdue Long Jie.

“Did he discover it?”

“It’s impossible. We’ve never met before. The problem must be elsewhere!” Luo Tian smiled constantly but his mind was thinking, pondering why this strange situation would arise.

“Rebellious dragon! I know you can understand my words. You also spoke human language earlier!” As Luo Tian thought, Duan Chengfeng approached the cage and scolded Long Jie.

“Give you a choice. Submit to me, and I’ll take you out. From now on, you’ll be my servant. I guarantee your life will be better than this!” Duan Chengfeng threatened and enticed, speaking to Long Jie.

“Idiot…” Seeing Duan Chengfeng’s actions, people showed disdain. This method had been used by Luan Tian Sect before; it was useless.

“Pain…” Long Jie seemed to ignore Duan Chengfeng’s words, constantly speaking. Its eyes were vacant, whispering.

Each time Long Jie said “pain,” it felt like a knife stabbing Luo Tian’s heart. He was deeply distressed. Long Jie hadn’t spoken this word in a long time; its ability to say it showed the suffering it endured under Luan Tian Sect.

“Rebellious beast! You still don’t submit!” Duan Chengfeng shouted, his eyes finally showing impatience. He raised a golden hand and swung it toward Long Jie.

“No use! Master Duan, we’ve tried everything—plucking its scales one by one. It still didn’t submit. We’ve used both soft and hard methods!” Guan Hongsheng shook his head, a smile in his eyes.

The golden hand flew toward Long Jie. Just as it was about to hit, Luo Tian couldn’t let Long Jie be hurt again. He vanished from his spot and punched Duan Chengfeng’s golden hand, instantly breaking it.

“Hmph? This kid isn’t simple!” Everyone’s faces turned serious upon seeing Luo Tian break Duan Chengfeng’s attack.

“Unbelievable. This kid killed Wang Tianlong. Duan Chengfeng is one of the eight elders in the Tianmen Sect—though he’s a bottom-tier elder, he still is one of the eight. His attack isn’t something an average mid-True Immortal can withstand!”

“But this kid easily blocked it. This proves his strength is comparable to a late-True Immortal!” In an instant, everyone raised Luo Tian’s strength another level.

“Master Duan, what do you mean?” Seeing Luo Tian’s actions, Duan Chengfeng’s face darkened. This was a direct slap in front of Luan Tian Sect.

However, Duan Chengfeng’s eyes flashed with a hint of fear. He knew Luo Tian’s strength, but he wasn’t afraid. Previously, he had nearly been killed by Luo Tian because of Guo Qianxue and underestimating him. Now, if they met again, Duan Chengfeng was certain he wouldn’t be as helpless.

“Master Duan, let me try!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Duan Chengfeng.

“Oh?” Duan Chengfeng slightly furrowed his brows. He saw a fleeting greed in Luo Tian’s eyes, and his face showed disdain.

“I don’t have any problem with this. But I wonder if Grand Elder Guan will agree!” Duan Chengfeng lightly laughed, shifting the responsibility to Guan Hongsheng.

“Haha, since Luo Tian wants to try, I’d be petty if I stopped him!” Guan Hongsheng lightly laughed.

“Thank you Grand Elder for your kindness!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, then stepped toward the cage. His eyes met Long Jie’s massive dragon eyes.

An unspoken understanding formed between the brothers, needing no words to know what each was thinking.

“Even Grand Elder Guan and many elders couldn’t subdue it. What qualifications does this kid have?” People sneered.

“Follow me. From now on, I live and you live; I die and you die!” Luo Tian lightly laughed. He waved his hands, emitting an ancient and沧桑 aura. It was just for show.

“Open!” Luo Tian roared, then grabbed the cage with both arms and exerted force.

“Crack…” Suddenly, multicolored lightning surged, striking Luo Tian. His face changed instantly.

“This lightning is stronger than a heavenly trial!” Luo Tian was struck by waves of lightning, feeling numbness.

“Ah…” Luo Tian roared continuously. His arms bulged with veins. He knew this was an opportunity; he could endure some injuries, but Long Jie had to be saved.
