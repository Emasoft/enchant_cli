“Hmph! Trying to be the last one out to draw attention?” Qi Daolin sneered, clearly suspecting Luo Tian of feigning effort to attract notice.

Luo Tian's number had reached thirteen thousand, and Lu Kunpeng's face was etched with confusion as he watched Luo Tian still trapped in the illusion and the number steadily rising. Lu Kunpeng's heart jolted: "How could this brat recognize herbs from the Xianyuan Continent? Impossible! I only learned eight thousand of them from an ancient text. How could he know?"

Lu Kunpeng couldn't help but be stunned. He refused to believe Luo Tian could identify herbs from the Xianyuan Continent. If he could, then the fortune he'd encountered must be beyond comprehension. On the Tianyuan Continent, any encounter tied to the Xianyuan Continent could forge a world-shattering genius.

Yet the facts were undeniable. Luo Tian's number had climbed to sixteen thousand, and though it was slow, reaching this figure meant he'd identified all eight thousand herbs within the illusion.

Qi Daolin's eyes narrowed as he saw Luo Tian was nine thousand short of his twenty-five thousand goal. His heart skipped a beat, but he soon laughed: "Guess that's your limit! Recognizing sixteen thousand herbs is impressive for a common-born disciple like you!"

Within the illusion, Luo Tian paused at sixteen thousand, gazing at the dense forest of herbs. He sighed softly: "Alright, let's go up to forty thousand. I'm too exhausted!"

Identifying sixteen thousand herbs had already annoyed Luo Tian, and he'd planned to stop at thirty thousand, unwilling to waste time here. Since the beginning, he'd spent five hours on this.

But as Luo Tian continued identifying, a smirk tugged at his lips: "That's it? Qi Daolin, are you trying to humiliate me? That's too ambitious!"

Luo Tian picked up a herb, glancing at it: "Soul-Quenching Grass..."

The moment he spoke the name, the verdant herb in his hand vanished instantly.

Chapter 62: Shocking the Dan Pavilion

Qi Daolin was currently basking in the flattery of the crowd, waiting for Luo Tian to exit the illusion. Once he did, Qi Daolin would be undeniably first in this round. Combined with his recent breakthroughs in alchemy, he was confident of securing the top spot and becoming Lu Kunpeng's disciple—a dream he'd long cherished.

"Look! Luo Tian's speed has increased!" the crowd gasped, stunned by the numbers trailing Luo Tian's name.

Qi Daolin snapped out of his reverie, gazing upward. His eyes narrowed as Luo Tian's number had reached twenty thousand and was still climbing. If it continued, it would surpass his own.

"Ha! Luo Tian's showing off! See how those who looked down on our disciples will react!" several disciples shouted.

"Exactly! It's time to shut up those self-important pricks who think they're the best!" a chorus of sneers echoed from the disciples.

Lu Kunpeng sighed, knowing this first round was already lost. He knew Luo Tian too well—his own skills were no match. He couldn't fathom who in the Dan Pavilion could rival Luo Tian, except perhaps the elder head of the pavilion and those ancient masters.

Qi Daolin's disbelief deepened as Luo Tian reached thirty-five thousand in half an hour—only a few thousand short of his own. He'd only need fifteen minutes to overtake him.

A moment ago, Qi Daolin had boasted of his invincibility. Now, watching Luo Tian's numbers climb and the shifting glances from the crowd—especially the sneers of those disciples—he felt a burning shame.

Yet the crowd hadn't noticed Qi Daolin's change, fixated instead on Luo Tian's ever-growing number.

"Forty thousand!" Luo Tian now stood unshakably first, yet his numbers kept climbing.

"Fifty thousand... Eighty thousand... A hundred thousand!" the crowd's breaths quickened, watching the young man standing proudly on the platform. Their faces bore reverence, even the elders on the stands wore expressions of disbelief. Among the more than a dozen elders, several couldn't recognize a hundred thousand herbs.

"How is this possible? He's still so young!" one elder exclaimed, stunned he could only recognize eighty thousand herbs.

"More than a hundred thousand! His numbers keep rising!" another elder marveled.

"Dai Laoshi, how many herbs can you recognize?" one elder cautiously asked Lu Kunpeng.

"Currently, I can identify two million herbs," Lu Kunpeng sighed softly.

"A gasp swept through the elders' seats. Hearing Lu Kunpeng's staggering two million eight hundred thousand, they couldn't help but admire him.

"Indeed, our Dan Pavilion's Grand Elder!" the elders' flattery echoed.

"Ah... but two months ago, I could only recognize one million eighty thousand!" Lu Kunpeng's smile turned bitter upon hearing the praise.

"Uh..." the elders hesitated, including Zhang Ziping, who only half-understood alchemy. They watched Lu Kunpeng curiously, wondering why the self-assured Dan Pavilion elder now wore a bitter expression.

"Ah... two months ago, I competed with Luo Tian on herb knowledge. He recited over one million five hundred thousand herbs, while I could only name one million eighty thousand! That's why I now claim to recognize two million—combining both our identifications!" Lu Kunpeng continued with a bitter smile.

"A gasp swept through the crowd again. No one could have imagined Luo Tian's herb knowledge could outmatch Lu Kunpeng by nearly half. What was the point of this first round?

"Why did he start so slowly?" one elder asked, regaining his composure.

Hearing the elder's question, Lu Kunpeng grew even more bitter: "Because I included herbs from outside the Tianyuan Continent in the initial list!"

The crowd grimaced, muttering that Lu Kunpeng had been cruel. Yet they were even more stunned by Luo Tian's ability to recognize all of them—another shock.

"1.5 million!" The Dan Pavilion crowd stared at Luo Tian's name, awestruck.

Zhang Ziping smiled: "Little brother, you didn't disgrace our sect!"

Lei Yong and Ji Chen nodded firmly. They often felt stifled in the Dan Pavilion, their bodies and abilities overlooked by disciples who were weaker. Yet with Luo Tian's rise, they'd grown bolder. From now on, anyone who boasted of their alchemy superiority before them would be met with: "First challenge me, then you may speak!"

Qi Daolin's face was ashen. A moment ago, he'd felt certain of victory, even mocking Luo Tian. Now, the number one hundred and fifty thousand above him felt like a hand slapping his face repeatedly.

"Ha! Luo Tian truly is Luo Tian. I knew he must have been holding back!" the disciples cheered.

Lin Zhengyang watched Luo Tian standing there, a smile on his face. He'd long known he wasn't Luo Tian's match. His eyes burned with fierce determination: "Next round, you won't be so easy!"

Seeing no point in continuing, Lu Kunpeng waved his hand, forcibly pulling Luo Tian from the illusion.

Luo Tian felt a ripple around him, still holding herbs in his hands. He appeared before the crowd, puzzled by why he'd been summoned.

"First round: Luo Tian first, Qi Daolin second, Lin Zhengyang third!" Lu Kunpeng's voice announced the end of this round.

The crowd was still eager for more, as Luo Tian hadn't finished. But the Grand Elder had spoken. They said nothing more, only casting respectful glances at Luo Tian before preparing for the next round.

Chapter 63: Second Round of Competition

"Boom..." The heavy bell rang again the day after the competition.

The Dan Pavilion's square filled with people, all discussing Luo Tian's astonishing one million figures from yesterday.

Qi Daolin stood among the crowd, listening to people praising Luo Tian's genius. His jealousy was unbearable, yet he had no choice—he truly wasn't his match.

"Today, you won't steal the spotlight so easily!" Qi Daolin clenched his fists, confidence in his eyes.

Meanwhile, other top disciples were also eager. They knew this second round was crucial—if Luo Tian remained first, he'd have an eighty percent chance of securing the top spot.

The Dan Pavilion's competition had three rounds: identifying herbs, condensing medicinal liquid, and refining pills. Today was the second round—condensing medicinal liquid.

"Cough!" A soft cough echoed through the crowd, drawing their attention to the elder who'd presided over yesterday's event.

"Indeed! Today is the second day of our Dan Pavilion's competition. As everyone knows, the second round tests condensing herbs. Yesterday, the elders decided to merge the second and third rounds into one!" The elder's voice rang out again.

"What? Why change it like this? Isn't that lowering the alchemists' performance?" murmurs spread.

"As an alchemist, one must condense medicinal liquid before refining pills. Previously, separating these steps caused many alchemists to excel at condensing but fail at refining—either exploding the furnace or failing to refine properly. When they mastered the final step, it was too late!" The presiding elder explained, addressing their confusion.

The crowd finally understood. They realized they'd focused too much on one part and neglected the other.

Yes, alchemists were meant to refine pills. This Dan Pavilion competition was a test or assessment—no need to ignore other parts because of it.

Seeing the alchemists grasp the elder's point, Lu Kunpeng felt relieved.

"Alright! I'll now announce the rules for this second round. You may choose herbs to refine the best and highest-grade pill you can make. As for the herbs, they'll be provided by the Dan Pavilion," the presiding elder said slowly. When he mentioned herbs being provided, his tone paused.

"Gasps!" The crowd murmured in awe. How could the Dan Pavilion afford such a massive amount of herbs for so many alchemists?

"Of course, we'll prevent anyone from slacking. If you claim to be able to refine but fail, you'll pay fifty percent of the herbs' value or contribute points. You decide. Also, if the herbs you request aren't available, you'll need to choose others," the elder continued, ignoring their shock.

Hearing this, some people lowered their heads in embarrassment—clearly the elder had touched on a sensitive point.

Luo Tian stood behind Zhang Ziping, silently marveling at the Dan Pavilion's grandeur. Only a place as rich as this could dare host such a competition.

"Alright! Now, please step onto the platform!" The elder's voice was calm.

As soon as he spoke, disciples like Luo Tian and Lin Zhengyang rushed to the platform. This time, they were spread out more. Dan Pavilion attendants placed furnaces before each competitor.

"You need only tell these attendants what herbs you want. As for the furnace, it can explode three times. If more, the round ends. Alright, let's begin!" The elder finally announced the start of the final round.

Luo Tian watched others hurriedly selecting herbs, assuming that finishing early would draw the elders' attention and give them a chance to be noticed.

Of course, this didn't apply to those confident in their abilities. Qi Daolin was one such person. He was currently pondering what pill to refine—his recent promotion to fourth-grade alchemist meant his success rate for fourth-grade pills wasn't high. He was hesitating whether to attempt a fourth-grade pill.

Luo Tian and Lin Zhengyang, along with other disciples, weren't rushing to select herbs. They were carefully thinking—this Dan Pavilion competition wasn't that important for them, merely a chance to gain fame. Their desire to win was secondary; they were already disciples, what else was there to fight for?

Yet due to Qi Daolin's arrogance in the first round, these disciples still wanted to humble his pride in this second round. After all, Qi Daolin's behavior had been too much for these hot-blooded disciples.

"What herbs will you choose?" Luo Tian recalled the pill formulas in "The Hundred Chapters of Herbs," thousands flashing through his mind.

Disciples waiting for Luo Tian to announce their herbs watched the Dan Pavilion's genius, heartbeats quickening. They'd heard of Luo Tian's feats since his trial at the Five Elements Sect, even about his past as a lowly attendant in the Flying Cloud Sect.

These stories had spread among attendants, and Luo Tian—a lowly attendant from a second-rate sect—had reached this point. Why couldn't they? Most attendants in the Five Elements Sect now regarded Luo Tian as their idol.

As Luo Tian pondered, Qi Daolin had already handed his list of herbs to the attendants. He glanced around, and upon seeing Luo Tian still deep in thought, sneered: "Hmph! You must be out of formulas. This second round won't let you shine so much. Even if you're bright, I'll be brighter!"

After Qi Daolin, other disciples of Lin Zhengyang also gradually submitted their herb lists to the attendants.

Luo Tian's attendant, seeing most had chosen herbs but Luo Tian still closed his eyes in thought, looked anxious.

"Here it is!" Suddenly, a glint of light flashed in Luo Tian's eyes.

Chapter 64: The Thousand-Page Brushing Dan Technique

"Seven Star Bone-Nourishing Pill!" A glint of light flashed in Luo Tian's eyes, and the description of the Seven Star Bone-Nourishing Pill appeared in his mind.

"Seven Star Bone-Nourishing Pill! Here you are!" Luo Tian quickly listed the herbs and handed them to the attendant with a smile.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian politely thanked the attendant.

Yet, to the attendant, this was a model of approachability. What was his status? The lowest in the Five Elements Sect. And what was Luo Tian's status? The most dominant and powerful disciple of the Dan Pavilion's Grand Elder. Yet this person still treated him politely. The attendant's eyes glimmered with emotion.

Recalling the experiences of his companions, some alchemists were kind and handed herbs to attendants. Others were less so—some just tossed them, others even cursed. This was the Dan Pavilion; elsewhere, attendants weren't treated as people at all. Luo Tian's actions couldn't help but astonish the attendants.

"Go on, prepare them for me!" Luo Tian had once been an attendant and guessed the attendants' thoughts.

Not long after, the attendants rushed back, nervous and said: "Luo Senior Brother, these are the herbs you requested. Check if anything's missing. If there's an error, I'll go get them again!"

Luo Tian took the storage bag and scanned it with his spiritual sense, confirming no herbs were missing. It was just enough for three furnaces. He added: "Thank you! Also, I have a message for you—if you don't respect yourself, no one will either!"

The attendant's eyes glimmered with thought, repeating Luo Tian's words over and over.

Luo Tian didn't notice the attendant. He saw himself in the attendant—just as weak back then.

He sighed, looking around. Qi Daolin had already arranged his herbs and glanced at Luo Tian, who was looking around. Qi Daolin's eyes held a challenge, then he stopped gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian sneered inwardly. He wondered why Qi Daolin, now over thirty, still acted like a youth—competing and striving as fiercely as the young. This confused Luo Tian.

Luo Tian then glanced at Lin Zhengyang, nodded to him, and looked around. Most had started the process of condensing herbs.

Lu Kunpeng's eyes remained fixed on Luo Tian, knowing his bet with Luo Tian was about to end.

Yet after arranging the herbs, Luo Tian didn't start condensing immediately. He sat cross-legged instead.

"Good! He's adjusting to his peak state. Excellent!" Lu Kunpeng nodded in approval, admiring Luo Tian's calmness—alchemy was the worst for rushing.

"Look! Qi Daolin is condensing medicinal liquid so fast. He's already halfway done!" The crowd marveled at Qi Daolin.

Qi Daolin, seeing himself valued again, regained his annoying smile. He was now using his alchemy technique.

"Dan Hand!" Qi Daolin had spent a fortune to buy this method from a Dan Pavilion elder. It had increased his success rate by twenty percent!

"Flower-Shadow Dan Hand! Look, it's the Grand Elder's secret technique! We're lucky to witness it, even if it's not the Grand Elder himself. Lin Zhengyang must have mastered it!" As Qi Daolin boasted, the crowd's gasps interrupted him. He glanced at Lin Zhengyang.

"Uh..." Qi Daolin was stunned. It was beautiful—Lin Zhengyang's hands were jade-like, and if one only saw his hands, they'd think a young girl was picking flowers in a field.

Because he was stunned by Lin Zhengyang's Flower-Shadow Dan Hand, there was a "boom" as his furnace exploded. Qi Daolin looked at the fragments with despair, wanting to cry.

"Dammit! The first furnace to explode is me!" Qi Daolin thought of crying, watching the crowd's eyes shift from respect to mockery. He felt as if he'd eaten a fly.

"Look, it's the Second Elder's Dragon-Union Dan Hand, Third Elder's Cloud-Wave Brushing Dan Hand..." Yet the crowd no longer focused on Qi Daolin. More and more disciples were using their masters' secret techniques, making the platform dazzling. People even forgot to watch Luo Tian, who had been silent and now opened his eyes.

Lu Kunpeng also saw the dazzling techniques and felt欣慰, sighing: "The quality of this generation's disciples is surprisingly high!"

But when Lu Kunpeng saw the crowd's eyes on Luo Tian, he stopped observing others and focused again on Luo Tian.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, seeing the dazzling hand movements around him. He let out a sigh and glanced at Lu Kunpeng on the platform: "Grand Elder, I'm about to start!"

Lu Kunpeng saw Luo Tian's eyes and knew he was about to use the Thousand-Page Brushing Dan Technique. He didn't blink, fearing missing any detail.

Under Lu Kunpeng's tense gaze, Luo Tian extended his hands. A stream of water-element spiritual energy gathered in them. He took out a wooden basin and placed it on the ground, slowly gathering water-element spiritual energy until it formed a stream into the basin.

Lu Kunpeng was puzzled by Luo Tian's actions but watched intently to see what he'd do next.

Luo Tian slowly extended his hands, plunging them into the water and rubbing it. His face showed no expression.

Lu Kunpeng was more puzzled, his tension making him feel the action was familiar. Yet he said nothing and continued watching.

After rubbing for a while, Luo Tian shook his hands in the air. A white cloth appeared in his hands.

When Lu Kunpeng saw this, blood rushed to his throat: "You little brat!"

At that moment, Lu Kunpeng wanted to slap Luo Tian. His attention had been too focused; he hadn't known what Luo Tian was doing. Now, realizing it, he cursed aloud. This kid had been washing his hands! He'd mistakenly thought Luo Tian was using the Thousand-Page Brushing Dan Technique's slow motion.

Yes, Luo Tian had indeed been washing his hands. He wanted to reach his peak state for the Seven Star Bone-Nourishing Pill, maximizing his sensitivity to herbs. He hadn't expected this casual action would anger Lu Kunpeng again.

Lu Kunpeng had just cursed when he saw the elders' eyes focused on him. His face turned slightly serious, then resumed watching Luo Tian.

Chapter 65: Condensing

Lu Kunpeng again focused his gaze on Luo Tian, his eyes flashing.

The elders who had been drawn by Lu Kunpeng's shout also turned their attention to Luo Tian.

At this moment, Luo Tian's surroundings constantly formed hand images, as if motionless. They seemed real yet had an ethereal quality. More astonishingly, Luo Tian's hands kept changing but created no ripple at all—like his hands and the herbs he held were part of the world itself.

"Thousand-Page Brushing Dan Technique!" One elder whispered excitedly.

Lu Kunpeng watched the platform as if no one else existed. Luo Tian seemed to be the only presence in the world, and he felt tears welling up. He thought of a man who had disappeared long ago—his revered mentor, the one who'd greatly helped him in alchemy.

No one knew Lu Kunpeng had once been an outer sect disciple, discovered by the Dan Pavilion's old headmaster. He'd been taught alchemy knowledge. Without the old headmaster's teachings, Lu Kunpeng wouldn't be where he was today.

Otherwise, with his personality, how could he allow Zhang Ziping to sit as Dan Pavilion's head? If Zhang Ziping wasn't the disciple of that man, regardless of whether he was in the Yuanling realm or not, Lu Kunpeng could have removed him from that position. It was only because Zhang Ziping was the disciple of that man that Lu Kunpeng could tolerate a non-alchemist sitting as Dan Pavilion's head.

"Hey! Luo Tian! What technique is he using? It feels so perfect, as if it's融入 into the world!" Someone finally noticed Luo Tian and marveled.

As that person spoke, people realized this was the most talented participant in the Dan Pavilion competition. But as their eyes turned to Luo Tian, they couldn't look away—everyone gazed at the man standing in the world, now seeing no one but Luo Tian.

Yet Luo Tian was unaware of the situation outside. His full attention was on alchemy, picking herbs and staring at the furnace intently. His face bore an unprecedented seriousness.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..."

Explosions echoed constantly.

Lin Zhengyang sighed, shaking his head. When he saw Luo Tian use the Thousand-Page Brushing Dan Technique, he knew first place was out of his reach. Hearing the explosions around him, Lin Zhengyang chuckled—he believed any alchemist who'd watched Luo Tian's condensing technique would explode.

Qi Daolin's face was pale, a bad feeling stirring in his heart. He'd glanced at Luo Tian and the second batch of pills exploded. That meant Qi Daolin had only one chance left. If he failed again, not only would he miss first place but also have to pay a high fee for the herbs. Thinking of the herbs he'd chosen, Qi Daolin's heart trembled. Even though it was only fifty percent, it wasn't something he could afford now.

Thinking this through, Qi Daolin finally set aside his last distractions and started refining the final batch of herbs.

Lin Zhengyang and other disciples also showed a momentary look of seriousness. Though they'd exploded one batch, they now calmed their minds and focused on refining their own pills.

Some who'd exploded three batches looked helpless. This second round was clearly out of their reach, so they continued watching Luo Tian refine his pills.

At this moment, Luo Tian had completed refining all the herbs. The swirling hand images dispersed, and a stream of pure medicinal liquid gathered in his furnace under his spiritual sense. His spiritual sense continuously compressed it.

"Ugh..." The furnace echoed with a deep sound, and fragrances constantly emitted from it.

"This is what kind of pill? I feel refreshed after just a whiff, and my cultivation seems to have increased!" One alchemist who'd exploded three batches marveled at Luo Tian. He was certain he'd never heard of this pill. If successful, it would definitely be a fourth-grade or higher.

"Boom!" A deafening explosion echoed from the platform.

Luo Tian sighed helplessly: "Ah... it's really hard to control herbs' power. I was already at my best!"

Hearing the explosion, people knew this batch of pills was ruined. They all sighed in disappointment.

At this point, most alchemists had already refined their pills and submitted them. A stream of fragrances flowed from the Dan Pavilion's mountain peaks.

"Hey, it's the Dan Pavilion competition! I wonder which little fellow will stand out this year!" Wei Mingxuan stood on the Five Elements Sect's main peak, suddenly recalling the thin figure on the Ascending Stairs. He chuckled and continued sipping tea.

"The Dan Pavilion competition! I should go see who will stand out this year. Later, I can tell our younger generation to befriend him!" The fire peak's Simu Anle vanished in a flash.

Meanwhile, wherever the Dan fragrance drifted, every peak's head disappeared from their positions.

On the Thick Earth Peak, Huang Jingshan's face was gloomy as he watched toward the Dan Pavilion. Yang Huanyu stood calmly before him: "I'll handle the Dan issue."

Hearing Yang Huanyu's words, Huang Jingshan's face improved slightly, his expression carrying a hint of respect: "Thank you, Young Master!"

"Hmph! I've told you so many times. Don't call me that in the Five Elements Sect, even when we're alone!" Yang Huanyu scolded Huang Jingshan.

"Yes!" Huang Jingshan quickly replied.

If anyone had seen this from afar, they'd have been shocked at their peak's head showing such respect to a new disciple. Unfortunately, no one saw this astonishing scene.

...

On the Dan Pavilion's square, most alchemists had already refined their pills and submitted them. The remaining few focused on refining.

Lin Zhengyang's eyes burned with madness, his voice growling: "Three-Transcendence Accumulation Pill! Let it condense!"

As Lin Zhengyang's voice echoed, his furnace radiated waves of spiritual energy. The surrounding spiritual energy rushed into the furnace.

"Fourth-grade pill!" The crowd gasped, and Lu Kunpeng was satisfied with his disciple's performance.

Whether in character or dedication to pills, Lin Zhengyang had never disappointed Lu Kunpeng.

Fourth-grade pills could self-absorb spiritual energy and condense into pills. The alchemist only needed to control the spiritual energy within the pill with their spiritual sense, ensuring it wasn't damaged. This was the hardest step, requiring high control over one's spiritual sense.

Refining a fourth-grade pill meant entering the ranks of fourth-grade alchemists. Later, even on the Tianyuan Continent, one would be invited by various forces.

As people hadn't yet recovered from Lin Zhengyang's fourth-grade pill, waves of spiritual energy continued to echo from several disciples' furnaces.

Chapter 66: Blood-Flame Refining

As Lin Zhengyang's Three-Transcendence Accumulation Pill was completed, other top disciples seemed to have coordinated. Their furnaces emitted waves of thunderous sounds, spiritual energy forming within.

Suddenly, the spiritual energy on the platform became chaotic. Pills formed from the furnaces one after another.

The crowd was stunned, silently sighing that disciples truly deserved the title of genius.

The surrounding elders watched their disciples refine fourth-grade pills, faces showing satisfaction. Their pride was evident as the success of their students reflected on them.

The fragrance of medicine had drawn in various peak heads, who all looked at the young people on the platform with admiration. They silently memorized their appearances to tell their disciples to befriend them.

"Boom!" A discordant sound echoed from the platform, drawing people's attention.

"Luo Tian! It's Luo Tian again! He exploded another furnace! What pill is he refining!" The crowd looked at Luo Tian in confusion.

"Something's wrong!" A glint of light flashed in Luo Tian's eyes. He quickly took out the furnace, placing his hands on the fire mouth and reactivating the Thousand-Page Brushing Dan Technique.

"Hey! This kid? Isn't he the Five Elements Body? I didn't think he could refine pills!" The peak heads marveled, watching Luo Tian with interest.

At this moment, other disciples had already submitted their pills. The crowd turned to the remaining people, and now focused on Qi Daolin.

Though he was from the Herb Hall, Qi Daolin had a small reputation in the Dan Pavilion because Lu Kunpeng had once guided him. Though some hoped for him, they still believed he was no match for the disciples of the elders.

Yet Qi Daolin was drenched in sweat, his spiritual sense not daring to divert even a bit. His hands on the fire mouth trembled slightly due to nervousness. He knew if this batch succeeded, he'd be famous in the Five Elements Sect and crush those disciples.

"Boom!" The furnace exploded. The only remaining disciple looked pale, having done his best but failing at the final step.

Now, only Luo Tian and Qi Daolin remained. Luo Tian's speed was surprisingly fast, quickly entering the final condensation phase.

Luo Tian's rapid pace again amazed the elders at the wonders of the Thousand-Page Brushing Dan Technique.

"Buzz..." The familiar sound echoed. Qi Daolin's face was ecstatic, his eyes glowing with intense light.

Surrounding spiritual energy rushed into Qi Daolin's furnace at a terrifying speed, seeping through the cracks.

"What kind of pill is this? It's absorbing spiritual energy so fiercely!" The crowd marveled. No one now mocked Qi Daolin for exploding twice.

"Buzz..." Another wave of spiritual energy surged.

"Look! Luo Tian has also entered the final condensation phase. I wonder if he can succeed this time!" The crowd focused on the two remaining people, watching to see what pills they were refining. Both had exploded twice and now had only one chance left.

Two batches of pills, like cultivators, absorbed the spiritual energy from above the Dan Pavilion without stopping.

"If this continues, neither of them will succeed due to thin spiritual energy!" One elder said gravely, watching the two batches.

"Let's see who's pill is more powerful!" Lu Kunpeng sighed, complexly watching Luo Tian. At this point, he no longer cared about the bet with Luo Tian. He realized he'd made a mistake—grossly misjudging Luo Tian. But Lu Kunpeng was magnanimous and had decided to apologize to Luo Tian after the competition.

"Hmph! Competing in pill power with me?" Qi Daolin sneered, his spiritual sense probing into the furnace. The pill inside spun rapidly, increasing its absorption speed.
