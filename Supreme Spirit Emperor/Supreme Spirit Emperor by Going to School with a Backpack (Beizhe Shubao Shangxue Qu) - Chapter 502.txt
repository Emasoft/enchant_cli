“Three Elders, what do you intend to do?” Luotian saw the smiles in their eyes and felt something was amiss.

“Young man, you are now the face of Shenglong Sect. Your strength must not be weak!” Zang Yunfei, the elder of the Heavenly Dragon Sect, spoke softly.

“Moreover, you should master the strengths of all three sects and learn everything from them!” Zhao Tielong, elder of the Iron Dragon Sect, shouted loudly.

“Exactly! You must cultivate our Earth Dragon Sect’s Nourishing Soul Technique, the Heavenly Dragon Sect’s Formless Art of the Heavenly Dragon, and also master Iron Dragon Sect’s Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation!”

“Within a year, the sect will provide you with resources to choose from. We expect you to reach the peak of Celestial Immortal during the Struggle for Heaven!” Pei Jianping, elder of the Earth Dragon Sect, also joined in.

“Then it’s a good thing!” Luotian felt his heart light up, secretly lamenting that his previous efforts had not been in vain.

“Enough. Let’s start with the Formless Art of the Heavenly Dragon!” Zang Yunfei smiled and addressed Luotian.

……

On another front, the three sects’ powerhouses had debated merging for over ten days. Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande finally led their people out of the Heavenly Dragon Sect towards the Earth Dragon and Iron Dragon Sects.

Throughout the Lower Three Heavens, news of the three sects merging spread. However, most people found it hard to believe that the three mighty sects would merge.

When Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande returned to their respective sects, all three sects simultaneously announced the merger. From now on, there would only be Shenglong Sect.

“Indeed merged! The sect leader himself spoke—there’s no mistake!” The news of the three sects merging into Shenglong Sect spread like wildfire across the Lower Three Heavens.

In the Heavenly Dragon Sect, under Li Changfeng’s leadership, all the sect’s Celestial Immortal disciples ascended into the sky. Golden dragons soared from the hands of numerous disciples, attaching themselves to the vast body of Heavenly Dragon Mountain.

“Rise!” Li Changfeng roared. Celestial Immortal disciples at the initial stage of cultivation exerted their strength, lifting the massive Heavenly Dragon Mountain from the ground. The disciples pulled it toward the center of the Lower Three Heavens.

The Earth Dragon Sect and Iron Dragon Sect’s massive mountains also rose into the air. Three great peaks pushed through the heavens, heading toward the center of the Lower Three Heavens.

“Indeed merged! Even their mountain gates have moved!” The entire Lower Three Heavens erupted in chaos. Figures soared into the air, clearing paths for the three sects.

“If merging three sects still fails to succeed, which other sect could?” Sect leaders sat in their halls, murmuring lowly.

“Does that mean we also have the right to participate in the Struggle for Heaven? After all, there’s only one sect left now!” In a dark hall, an old man spoke coldly.

Chapter 1934: Oppressive Cultivation

The Lower Three Heavens had long maintained a triangular formation among the three sects. But now, their massive peaks converged.

“Thunderous roars…” Zang Yunfei, Pei Jianping, and Zhao Tielong soared into the sky, gazing at the boundless peaks.

“Today, Shenglong Sect opens its gates!” The three elders shouted. Their voices echoed into the heavens.

“Roar…” A disciple soared into the sky, howling. The entire Lower Three Heavens resounded with the cries of Shenglong Sect disciples.

“Let Iron Dragon Mountain be the head…”

“Let Heavenly Dragon Mountain be the body…”

“Let Earth Dragon Mountain be the tail…” The three elders spoke in turn. Tremendous True Immortal power spread, merging the three peaks with their combined strength.

“Peng…” The boundless mountain fell to the ground, as if it could collapse the earth itself.

“Longtian Sect congratulates Shenglong Sect on its founding…”

“Xuanlong Sect congratulates Shenglong Sect on its founding…” Voices of congratulations rose into the sky. Almost all sects in the Lower Three Heavens arrived at the sound.

These were genuine congratulations, their voices laced with joy. After all, three major sects had merged into one. From now on, only one major sect remained—giving these smaller sects a chance to rise.

A dragon hundreds of miles long stood before the people’s eyes, formed by the merged peaks of the three sects.

“Everyone, today Shenglong Sect opens its gates. Since you, the heads of the Lower Three Heavens’ sects, have come to congratulate us, we should invite you into the mountain. However, the mountain gate needs construction—please return first. Three days later at the opening ceremony, we will certainly invite you!” Li Changfeng addressed the gathered sect leaders.

“Then we await your good news, esteemed masters!” A laugh echoed through the crowd. The voice was somewhat insincere.

“Who!” Upon hearing this, Li Changfeng, Sima Xiu, and Peng Tiande’s faces turned icy.

Yet the voice only sounded once before vanishing. Li Changfeng and the others’ faces darkened.

“Did you notice?” Zang Yunfei asked Zhao Tielong and Pei Jianping, his voice turning solemn.

“No!” Their faces also showed concern. They could not fathom who in the Lower Three Heavens possessed such a figure. However, recalling Jiang Taibai, they knew the Lower Three Heavens were indeed full of hidden talents.

Though the words had no issue, they carried a provoking tone. Now Shenglong Sect was one sect, but the opponent referred to three masters. To be challenged at the opening ceremony was deeply annoying.

“Enough. Let’s continue. A cowardly scoundrel!” Zang Yunfei addressed the crowd, and they began moving.

“Let’s go see that boy!” Zang Yunfei and the others exchanged smiles before flying into the newly merged Shenglong Mountain.

In a quiet courtyard, Luotian sat in meditation. The chaos outside had no effect on him. Even the merging of three peaks had not disturbed him, as if he were a monk in deep meditation.

“Woo…” A surge of gray energy radiated from Luotian,凝聚ing before him.

A gray figure stood there, its eyes glowing with intense joy.

“Finally achieved!” The gray soul spoke softly. Its hands began to change, emitting powerful waves.

“Woo…” A long sword materialized in the gray soul’s hand. Then a long spear, and so on—numerous weapons were conjured by Luotian.

“Excellent, young man!” At this moment, Zang Yunfei and the others appeared before Luotian, their faces showing surprise.

“Nourishing Soul Technique—so quickly achieved! You’ve reached the stage of soul separation!” Pei Jianping praised, gazing at Luotian’s tangible soul.

“Peng…” The conjured weapons shattered. The gray soul returned to Luotian’s body, and his eyes slowly opened.

“The feeling of soul separation—how long it has been!” Luotian smiled. In the Nine Realms, rules did not suppress him, so he could achieve soul separation early on. But in the Immortal Heavens, achieving it was truly difficult.

“This young man’s soul is an anomaly. I feel his soul is even more extraordinary than his body!” Zhao Tielong’s face glowed with admiration, gazing at Luotian.

Hearing Zhao Tielong’s words, Zang Yunfei and Pei Jianping also showed admiration. Initially, they had only wanted Luotian to learn the three sects’ arts. But they hadn’t expected his talent to be so extraordinary—his soul, body, and cultivation were nearly perfect.

They had the idea of taking him as a disciple. After all, three elders taking one disciple naturally made him a junior sect leader, which would be convincing.

At first, they competed for him. But later decided to cultivate Luotian into a complete genius—otherwise, it would be unworthy of his talent. Thus, they decided to jointly take him as a disciple.

But they hadn’t expected that when they approached him, he had refused without hesitation.

“Young man, are you reconsidering becoming our disciple?” Zang Yunfei rubbed his hands, gazing at Luotian.

“After you beat me!” Luotian shook his head lightly. At this moment, it wasn’t necessary; he didn’t want to find a master.

Though Zang Yunfei, Zhao Tielong, and Pei Jianping were strong—True Immortal late-stage—they would be renowned figures in the Middle Three Heavens, each a guest of honor at sects.

But Luotian had high aspirations. He already had many masters, even if they weren’t as strong as him. Luotian knew that once a master, always a master.

The time with Xuan Dan was unavoidable. To save Sun Kedian, becoming Xuan Dan’s disciple was the fastest way.

“You…” Upon hearing Luotian’s words, Zang Yunfei and the others turned red with anger, wanting to vomit blood.

Previously, they had begged him endlessly. Luotian refused every time. Finally, he devised a plan—without using cultivation or body strength, to fight fairly. If any of them could beat him, he would become their disciple.

This demand naturally seemed trivial to them. Luotian was strong, but in their eyes, he was still a young upstart. They were over a thousand years old—how could they refuse?

But once they fought, they met their demise. Their combined age was less than the time Luotian spent in the Nine Realms. His combat experience made them no match.

Zang Yunfei and Pei Jianping were knocked down one after another. Even Zhao Tielong, skilled in combat, was defeated within an hour.

Two against one, three against one—yet they still fell to Luotian. This left them in shock at his terrifying combat experience.

“Are you reconsidering?” Zang Yunfei and the others shouted, their faces flushed with anger.

“Enough. Old Zang, you three were destined not to be my masters. I already have a master. He is a true immortal of the present!” Luotian’s face showed admiration, recalling the young Zhang Daotian.

At first, Luotian didn’t know Zhang Daotian’s cultivation in the Nine Realms. But now, after spending time in the Immortal Heavens, he finally understood how strong Zhang Daotian had been.

True Immortal peak—when Luotian saw Jiang Taibai, it felt like seeing Zhang Daotian in his youth. He was just one step away from being a half-step Immortal King!

“Hmph… I’ll see for myself who your master is. And how did you achieve such extraordinary combat experience!” Zhao Tielong sneered, clearly annoyed at losing to this young upstart.

“Young man, it’s time to practice the Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation. Come on, let’s give you a good workout!” Zang Yunfei and the others seemed to have remembered something, their eyes unkindly looking at Luotian.

“Um… today we don’t need to practice the Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation. I haven’t even mastered the Formless Art of the Heavenly Dragon yet!” Luotian, seeing their unkind glances, instinctively trembled.

“That’s not up to you!” Zang Yunfei spoke. A golden hand凝聚ed, grabbing Luotian who tried to escape.

“Punish this kid! He’s disrespectful, calling me Old Pei!” Pei Jianping smiled coldly and clenched his fists, striking Luotian.

“Haha, young man, you’re the slowest at this cultivation. Today we’ll practice two more hours!” Zhao Tielong also sneered, swinging his large palm and striking Luotian.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed continuously on the back mountain of Shenglong Sect, confusing its disciples.

“What’s going on? The three elders were supposed to teach Luotian their sect’s secret arts, but it sounds so brutal!”

“Brother, you don’t know. It must be the Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation. I heard that when Peng Zong… no, Peng Tiande’s Grand Elder perfected it, he was beaten a lot. Everyone in the sect beat him once!” A former disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Sect and another from the Iron Dragon Sect, both carrying a heavy stone on their shoulders, whispered.

“Unexpectedly, Grand Elder Peng also had such a shameful side!” They chuckled, sharing stories of their former sects, growing closer.

Throughout Shenglong Sect, such scenes filled the air. Luotian and his companions never expected that their beating would promote disciple exchanges.

Three hours later, Luotian soaked in a vat of medicinal liquid, his face alternating between red and pale.

Chapter 1936: Immortal King’s Disciple

“Master, my heart belongs to you. However, I still have a great grudge. Once you help me avenge it, I will serve you wholeheartedly!” Wan Youlan respectfully addressed the youth.

She knew this youth would act. Wan Youlan had left the Heavenly Dragon Sect to seek revenge, and in the Middle Three Heavens she met this youth.

Nie Sheng, a genius of the Eternal Mountain among the nine supreme immortal sects. His father was a direct disciple of the Eternal Immortal King, Nie Yuntian—his favorite son.

Nie Sheng’s strength and status were enough to crush many. A person like Luotian was no match for Nie Yuntian.

“Someone has acted. Let’s see!” Nie Sheng spoke softly, gazing at the sky where a middle-aged man flew.

“Master Luotian, I am from the Purple Flame Pavilion. Wu Yonglu, please grant me a lesson!” The middle-aged man showed respect but was secretly nervous. He knew Luotian’s past victories. If it weren’t for the sect leader sending him, he wouldn’t have come.

“Please!” Luotian spoke softly. This fight wasn’t a life-or-death battle but to establish authority—point-and-kill.

“Flame of the Heavens!” Wu Yonglu roared, his hands forming a seal. A torrent of purple flames surged from his hands toward Luotian.

“Purple Flame Pavilion’s strongest technique—Middle-stage Immortal Art!” Someone recognized Wu Yonglu’s skill and shouted.

“This Wu Yonglu isn’t foolish. He started with his strongest attack, aiming for a quick victory. After all, the opponent is Luotian, who has no equal among True Immortals below the peak!” People murmured.

“Haha, a late-stage Celestial Immortal dares to challenge our Master Luotian!” Shenglong Sect disciples shouted, some loudly, others watching Luotian. Most of them were from the Earth Dragon and Iron Dragon Sects; they had only heard but never seen Luotian fight.

“This is quite troublesome!” Luotian gazed at the torrent of purple flames. If it were before, he would have devoured them immediately. But now, he was restricted to using only the three sects’ techniques.

“Woo…” Luotian took a step forward, rushing into the flames like an arrow.

“Indeed, Shenglong Sect’s young master! A Middle-stage Immortal Art—using his body to withstand it!” Cheers erupted from the main peak.

However, the Purple Flame Pavilion elder smiled slightly. He raised a cup of wine and drank it, knowing this technique’s terrifying heat—True Immortals at the peak would fear it.

“Peng…” Three seconds later, a streak of light burst from the purple flames. Luotian’s body was unscathed, glowing golden with a slight trace of fire smoke.

“Crack…” Luotian’s body instantly appeared before Wu Yonglu, colliding with his body.

Next moment, Wu Yonglu’s body flew back to the ground like a meteor. He only broke a few ribs but was otherwise unharmed.

“Strong! A late-stage Celestial Immortal is no match for one strike!” The various sect leaders’ strength trembled.

“Indeed, he has some skills. But it’s just his body that’s strong!” Nie Sheng sat there, watching the other sect leaders’ astonished expressions with disdain.

“Thank you, Master Luotian!” Wu Yonglu showed gratitude. The feeling of Luotian’s collision was like a flood, pressing one-third of his strength—otherwise, he would have been crushed.

“Continue!” Luotian addressed the crowd. But it resulted in silence. Such a powerful Luotian—who could match him?

“Anyone below True Immortal is acceptable, including those who self-restrict their cultivation!” Seeing no one coming forward, Yunfei elder spoke again. The effect wasn’t enough; they didn’t want this to end in vain.

“Is that allowed?” Upon hearing Yunfei elder’s words, many sect leaders felt intrigued. Yet no one dared to be the first—because it would be embarrassing.

“I’ll go!” As everyone hesitated, a shout echoed. An old man stood in the sky, his aura indicating early-stage True Immortal.

“Blood Dragon Pavilion Elder, Zhou Xueyi!” The old man’s identity was recognized. After all, there weren’t many early-stage True Immortals in the Lower Three Heavens.

“Blood Dragon Pavilion?” Luotian’s brows furrowed. He remembered killing Zhou Xueyi’s disciple, Xuetu, in the Chaos Sect.

“Approved!” Zang Yunfei and the others also furrowed their brows. The Blood Dragon Pavilion had a bad reputation in the Lower Three Heavens. Those who opposed it never had good endings—either destroyed or hunted to the point of no escape. It was this ruthless nature that allowed the Blood Dragon Pavilion to establish itself in the Lower Three Heavens.

Zhou Xueyi pressed his points, lowering his aura to half True Immortal. Yet everyone knew that self-restricted early-stage True Immortals were much stronger than true half-True Immortals.

“Can a half-True Immortal do it?” Zhou Xueyi grinned, addressing Luotian. But his smile made people shiver involuntarily.

“Unexpectedly, there are True Immortals who dare to self-restrict their cultivation and challenge Master Luotian!” Shenglong Sect disciples roared, showing unusual unity. Their voices of condemnation echoed through the sect.

“This is what we wanted!” Hearing these angry shouts, Zang Yunfei and the others smiled slightly.

“Seems I don’t need to act. That old man has hostility toward this kid!” Nie Sheng gazed at Zhou Xueyi in the sky.

“Please!” Luotian looked deeply at Zhou Xueyi, speaking softly. His eyes were more solemn now. This was his first confrontation with a half-True Immortal, and he felt Zhou Xueyi’s hostility.

“If Shenglong Sect’s young master is killed during the opening ceremony, it would definitely damage the sect’s prestige!” Nie Sheng spoke softly, opening a jade fan and gazing at Luotian.

“Unfortunately, I can’t personally avenge!” Wan Youlan showed hatred, pouring wine for Nie Sheng.

A woman entering the Middle Three Heavens from the Lower Three Heavens—only she knew the hardships. After all, entering the Middle Three Heavens wasn’t easy; there was also the expensive fee of the Mirage Island.

“Woo…” Under Shenglong Sect disciples’ curses, Zhou Xueyi’s aura rose. His gray robe suddenly turned blood-red, radiating an intimidating presence.

Luotian stood in the sky, his aura gradually rising. Invisible waves pushed toward Zhou Xueyi.

“Rippling…” Like two great tides colliding, their auras clashed.

“Aura?” Only Zang Yunfei and the others felt this clash of auras.

“This Zhou Xueyi is seeking his own demise. This kid’s soul is already nearly as strong as a True Immortal early-stage, even comparable to mid-stage. How could he lose!” Pei Jianping smiled, as Luotian’s Nourishing Soul Technique had progressed the fastest these days.

Indeed, Pei Jianping’s words hadn’t finished when Zhou Xueyi took two steps back. His blood-red robe fluttered, causing a stir among the crowd.

“Kill…” Zhou Xueyi’s eyes showed shock. He took a step forward, transforming into a streak of blood-red light toward Luotian.

At Zhou Xueyi’s movement, Luotian also stepped forward.

“Seven Killing Fists!” Zhou Xueyi roared, seven blood-red fists appearing around him, rushing toward Luotian.

The seven fists surrounded Luotian instantly. He paused slightly before shaking his body, a golden dragon’s image emerging from his body—Heavenly Dragon Formless Art.

“Peng… Peng…” As the dragon image appeared, seven blood-red fists struck down.

The golden dragon image shattered instantly. The blood-red fists also lost a few, but two still struck Luotian’s body, pushing him back twenty zhang. A streak of blood flowed from his mouth.

“Master Luotian was pushed back!” Shenglong Sect disciples gasped, gazing at Luotian. They hadn’t expected him to have a disadvantage so quickly.

“Too weak!” Zhou Xueyi’s eyes flashed with ferocity. He moved again, rushing toward Luotian.

“Roar…” The dragon image reappeared. Luotian still used the Heavenly Dragon Formless Art to counter, and two more blood-red fists struck his body.

“Although the Heavenly Dragon Formless Art is strong, the opponent is a self-restricted early-stage True Immortal. Master Luotian won’t last long!” Shenglong Sect disciples watched as Luotian’s body flew back again.

Zhou Xueyi didn’t care. He continued to attack, repeatedly launching blood-red fists. Luotian always countered with the Heavenly Dragon Formless Art, each time two fists hitting his body.

“Peng… Peng… Peng…” The thunderous sound echoed in the sky. Luotian’s body constantly endured the fists, his aura gradually weakening.

“Two hundred…” After an hour, Shenglong Sect disciples gasped. They had counted how many times Luotian was attacked by Zhou Xueyi.

“Seems I overestimated him. Indeed, a local from the Lower Three Heavens—no decent technique at all!” Nie Sheng shook his head.

“This kid must be planning to cultivate the Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation. Among the three techniques, only this one hasn’t been mastered yet!” Tie Tielong spoke softly. Luotian’s body was already strong, so mastering the Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation would be harder than usual.

Chapter 1937: His Thoughts Like a Knife

Above Shenglong Sect, bloodlight flickered continuously. Zhou Xueyi kept attacking, each time leaving Luotian in a dire situation.

But Luotian was like an indestructible underdog, always returning after being pushed back. He protected his body with the Heavenly Dragon Formless Art and fought against Zhou Xueyi.

“This is Shenglong Sect’s young master? Not much to it!” Many sect leaders secretly mocked. They had expected Yunfei elder’s bold words, thinking this Luotian was truly extraordinary.

“Indeed just rumors!” Their perception of Luotian’s strength dropped by a few levels, no longer as legendary as before.

“Unfair! Restricting True Immortal to half-True Immortal, Master Luotian has already endured this long. We haven’t seen the Middle Three Heavens’ geniuses, but I believe few could do this!” Shenglong Sect disciples cried out in protest.

“Master Luotian, fight with your previous methods!” Those who had seen Luotian’s battle in the Heavenly Dragon Sect shouted.

“Crack…” A breaking sound echoed. Luotian’s embroidered robe shattered, turning into fragments that vanished from sight.

Luotian’s fit body appeared before the crowd. His entire body was bruised, as if swollen.

“Lower-grade immortal artifact shattered!” Shenglong Sect disciples gasped in disbelief.

“Even a lower-grade immortal artifact was shattered. How strong must Zhou Xueyi’s Seven Killing Fists be! A regular late-stage Celestial Immortal would have been killed!” People sighed softly.

“Approximately,” Luotian wiped his mouth, took out a robe and put it on.

“You’re still alive!” Zhou Xueyi was astonished. His attacks were clear to him—so many punches, nearly draining half his True Immortal energy—but Luotian still endured.

Though his cultivation was restricted, it wasn’t something ordinary people could withstand.

“Woo…” As Zhou Xueyi was stunned, Luotian’s body emitted waves. His bruises rapidly recovered, returning to normal in an instant.

“Finally achieved the Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation!” Luotian’s eyes glowed with joy. He could feel his body had reached an extraordinary level—each skin cell seemed to carry immense power, each cell refined through countless trials.

“Concentration is the essence!” Luotian clenched his fists, waves rippling from his fingers. They seemed capable of tearing through the heavens.

“This extraordinary body—when he reaches True Immortal early-stage and undergoes the Heavenly Trials, I can’t even imagine how terrifying it would be!” Zhao Tielong’s face showed excitement.

“After beating me so long, now it’s my turn!” Luotian smiled and took a step forward. His Shadow Step activated, his body like a ghostly figure. A distortion wave appeared in the heavens, causing people to gasp.

“Roar…” The roar echoed. A golden dragon image flew from Luotian’s hands, wrapping around his arms. He struck Zhou Xueyi with one palm.

“Seven Killing Fists!” Zhou Xueyi’s eyes turned solemn. He had seen Luotian’s palm crack the void.

“Combining the Heavenly Dragon Formless Art with the Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation—this is incredible!” Zang Yunfei and Zhao Tielong were stunned.

“Master Luotian has retaliated! And he combined techniques from two sects!” Shenglong Sect disciples became excited, shouting.

“Peng… Peng… Peng…” Each punch and palm collision created cracks in the heavens. This time, Luotian didn’t fall behind but pressed Zhou Xueyi back.

“Puk…” Finally, Zhou Xueyi couldn’t withstand it. Luotian’s palm struck him, causing him to spit blood and fly back dozens of zhang.

“Two techniques combined—this is so strong!” Shenglong Sect disciples cheered, their eyes burning with admiration. They hadn’t expected Luotian to turn the tide and saw the benefits of merging sects—everyone had a chance to learn other sects’ arts.

Nie Sheng’s eyes glowed with admiration. He had followed Nie Sheng all the way, never having used his strength. Yet he had looked down on Middle Three Heavens’ geniuses, never finding any worthy. Now his evaluation of Luotian was so high, and he heard the weight in Nie Sheng’s voice.

“Kill…” Luotian’s eyes flashed with coldness. His body vanished, launching a new attack.

“Blood Demon Flash!” Zhou Xueyi saw Luotian move. His body transformed into a streak of blood mist, vanishing from sight.

Luotian struck with his palm. The heavens cracked. The blood mist was destroyed by Luotian’s palm, but Luotian’s brows furrowed slightly. The blood mist had凝聚ed on his arm, forming a strange mark.

“Hmm?” Luotian furrowed his brows. He extended his spiritual sense to find Zhou Xueyi’s position.

Before he could react, the space behind him twisted. A blood vortex appeared behind Luotian. Zhou Xueyi’s body materialized behind him, striking with a blood-colored fist toward Luotian’s back.

“Fast!” Everyone was startled. Even True Immortals felt their eyes blur, unable to follow Zhou Xueyi’s speed.

“Peng…” Zhou Xueyi struck Luotian’s back. Luotian’s body paused, his face turning red. His heart stopped for an instant.

“This body—my current strength can’t kill him!” Zhou Xueyi looked at Luotian, who only spat out a few bloods. His face was cold.

Seizing the moment Luotian hadn’t recovered, Zhou Xueyi formed a seal with his hands. Eight blood-colored daggers flew from his hands, each handle bearing the same mark as on Luotian’s arm.

The eight blood glows didn’t attack Luotian but surrounded a hundred zhang around him.

“Kill!” After this, Zhou Xueyi’s body vanished. He appeared before Luotian again, a blood-colored dagger in his hand. The cold light cut through the heavens, striking Luotian’s back.

“Beware!” All Shenglong Sect True Immortals stood up. They felt Zhou Xueyi’s killing intent.

“Don’t!” But before the three elders could act, Luotian’s voice echoed in their minds.

“Die!” Zhou Xueyi’s old eyes flashed with madness. He watched the blood dagger pierce Luotian’s back.

“Woo…” Just as the blood dagger touched Luotian’s skin, his body bent slightly.

“Puk…” Blood splattered. A dagger about a foot long pierced Luotian’s body, but not the vital points.

“What happened?” Everyone was confused. It was too fast—people only felt the sky darken, then Zhou Xueyi’s dagger pierced Luotian’s body.

“Your mother, so close!” Luotian vanished. His face was pale. He hadn’t expected Zhou Xueyi’s methods to be so powerful.

It wasn’t that Luotian didn’t want the three elders to directly eliminate Zhou Xueyi. It was because he didn’t want his previous efforts to be in vain. Seeing the disciples’ eyes, Luotian knew this fight hadn’t been in vain.

“Kill…” As Luotian pondered, Zhou Xueyi’s body appeared again. The blood dagger struck toward Luotian.

“Get out!” This time, Luotian was much better. He suddenly turned and struck with a fist. His body also moved slightly.

“Peng…” Luotian’s fist struck Zhou Xueyi’s face. The dagger pierced Luotian’s left arm.

“Terrifying!” Luotian’s face was pale. Blood continuously dripped from his body, two wounds causing him serious injuries.

“Is it this mark?” Luotian quickly found the key to Zhou Xueyi’s speed. This speed wasn’t possible for a half-True Immortal, not even for an early-stage True Immortal.

“Investigate the Blood Dragon Pavilion. The Blood Dragon Pavilion couldn’t have such a powerful technique!” Zang Yunfei transmitted his thoughts to Li Changfeng and Sima Xiu.

Upon hearing Zang Yunfei’s words, Li Changfeng and the others froze. They exchanged glances. Sima Xiu vanished into the crowd of elders.

Zhou Xueyi felt his head about to explode. His face twisted, hair disheveled. Blood flowed from his nose, eyes, and mouth, but he vanished.

“Soul Separation!” Luotian moved his hands. His gray soul suddenly flew out of his body,凝聚ing before it.

“Soul Like a Knife!” Luotian pointed. The gray soul knife fell, striking Zhou Xueyi.

“Puk…” At this moment, Zhou Xueyi didn’t know Luotian’s soul had left his body. The blood dagger pierced Luotian’s heart.

“Master Luotian!” The scene froze with the blood dagger piercing Luotian’s heart. Shenglong Sect disciples gasped.

“Ah…” Next moment, a piercing scream echoed in the sky. People didn’t see Luotian falling from the sky but instead saw Zhou Xueyi howling.

Chapter 1938: Killing Zhou Xueyi

“What’s going on?” Everyone was confused, gazing at Zhou Xueyi shouting in the sky. He had pierced Luotian’s back with a blood dagger, yet it was Zhou Xueyi who shouted.
