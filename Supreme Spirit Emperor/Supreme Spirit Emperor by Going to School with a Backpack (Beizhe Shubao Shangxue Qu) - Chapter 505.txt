The cultivation of ghostly beings requires absorbing spiritual energy, and there is an even faster method—devouring other ghosts. Undoubtedly, this devouring technique is the swiftest way for ghosts to ascend. Two ghost kings saw each other and immediately regarded their opponent as prey, colliding violently.

"Yugui Seal! You've cultivated the Yugui Seal? Your body carries a Guigu Mandate!" Nie Sheng's voice rose sharply, laced with disbelief.

As a direct descendant of the Nine Immortal Mountains, Nie Sheng knew well the existence of the Yugui Seal. His father possessed a Guigu Mandate, mastering the art of ghost control and becoming a sworn enemy of hellish beings. His name was renowned.

"KILL!" Luo Tian brandished the Zhenxian Brush, initiating the Zhenxian Eight Styles. Five golden characters surged forth with overwhelming power, descending upon Nie Sheng like a storm.

"Zhenxian Eight Styles! The martial arts of the Calligraphy Immortals!" Nie Sheng had yet to recover from the shock of Luo Tian's Guigu Mandate when he was again stunned.

"Unexpectedly, a disciple from the Lower Three Heavens has emerged as such a figure. If he continues to grow, he will surely become a formidable power in the present era! Regretfully, all of this shall belong to me today!" Nie Sheng's voice trembled with excitement. Luo Tian's techniques had utterly surprised him.

"Regretfully, I am at the peak of the Celestial Immortal realm, while you are merely at its later stage," Nie Sheng wielded the Yomeng War Halberd, spinning it rapidly in his grasp until it formed a black shield.

Boom after boom... The thunderous sound echoed ceaselessly, as the five golden characters repeatedly collided with the black shield.

Each character struck, and Nie Sheng's body descended slightly. Finally, his legs slammed into the ground, causing it to tremble violently.

"Spit...!" Nie Sheng coughed blood repeatedly, wounded again. His chest was stained crimson with blood—Luo Tian's powerful attack had been too much to withstand.

"Man...!" Luo Tian's voice carried a complex, guttural tone. His aura surged again as he took a step forward—this was the "Seven Stomps of the Barbarian God" technique.

"Eternal Life Gate!" Nie Sheng shouted as he saw the descending foot, his aura soaring. He waved his hands, and verdant spiritual energy surged forth, forming a green door that slowly rose. Though weaker than the one Nie Sheng had conjured with talismans, it still radiated awe.

"Boom..." The collision echoed. The green door shattered the golden foot, striking Luo Tian's body. This time, Luo Tian coughed blood violently, his body slamming into the hall's wall.

"What martial art is this!" Luo Tian marveled in shock. He had never imagined the Eternal Life Gate could be so powerful—his flesh alone barely withstood it.

"Eternal Life Gate!" Before Luo Tian could react, Nie Sheng retrieved a crystalline pill and swallowed it. His injuries healed instantly. The green door surged forth again, descending upon Luo Tian with lethal intent.

"That pill isn't simple!" Luo Tian's mind reeled. Yet his eyes gleamed with excitement. He formed seals, and his dantian roared to life. A torrent of sharp energy surged through his body, gathering toward his dantian.

Blades of energy roared around Luo Tian, enveloping him.

Chapter 1945: Formidable Opponent

"Formidable opponent!" Luo Tian had not encountered such a strong enemy in a long time. The sensation of being fully committed was exhilarating.

"I cannot lose, I must not lose!" Luo Tian roared repeatedly. A towering sword aura erupted from his body.

"What use is that?" Nie Sheng coldly replied, confident in his martial arts.

"Buzz..." As the Eternal Life Gate thundered downward, a torrent of sky-shattering blades erupted from Luo Tian's body, enveloping him.

"100... 1000..." The dense blades cleaved through the void, causing Nie Sheng's expression to shift instantly.

"Go..." Luo Tian extended his hand, pointing at the thundering Eternal Life Gate. In an instant, countless blades hummed and flew toward the emerald door.

"Crash..." A rain-like sound echoed through the hall. Each blade struck the green door, gradually being annihilated.

These blades had long resided within Luo Tian's body—extracted from the sword energy of Jiang Taibai's wine. They had spread throughout his limbs and organs, becoming one of his greatest killing techniques. Now, Luo Tian unleashed them.

The thunderous collisions continued for thirty breaths, annihilating the Eternal Life Gate. Even more terrifying was that many blades remained, controlled by Luo Tian and flying toward Nie Sheng.

"Life's peak is death!" Nie Sheng bellowed, spiritual energy erupting again. This time, he did not form the Eternal Life Gate but transformed into a green mist, instantly enveloping the entire hall.

"Buzz..." The concentrated vitality reached its peak. A withering force suddenly formed, instantly enveloping everyone in the hall.

Even Luo Tian's blades gradually lost their divine essence, transforming into gray spiritual energy before vanishing from sight.

"Luo Tian, our vitality is decaying!" Diao Dezhu was currently battling Wan Youlan. The purple-glowing fur dimmed considerably under the mist.

Wan Youlan was even more evident—fine wrinkles appeared on her face, and her skin lost its former luster.

Luo Tian's spiritual energy surged as he resisted the terrifying withering force while pondering a solution.

"Kill..." Nie Sheng, however, seemed unaffected. His spiritual energy surged as he wielded the Yomeng War Halberd and charged toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The Zhenxian Brush spun again, clashing with Nie Sheng. Simultaneously, Luo Tian scattered countless light points from his hands.

The withering force had slowed Luo Tian's movements, even reducing his strength compared to before.

"What use is that now?" Nie Sheng coldly said. The black halberd repeatedly struck Luo Tian's Zhenxian Brush, forcing him to retreat step by step. Each strike made Luo Tian's face pale.

"Death's peak is life!" Luo Tian's body slammed against the wall, spitting blood. Yet his eyes gleamed with fierce light.

"Everything Revives! Grass and Trees Become Soldiers!" Luo Tian formed seals, radiant clouds rising. A myriad of potent herbs and trees sprouted from the hall, restoring life to the previously dead space. The gray mist gradually dissipated.

The entire hall seemed to plunge into a world of herbs, everywhere green and vibrant with life.

"Kill..." Luo Tian wielded the Zhenxian Brush again, rushing toward Nie Sheng. Nie Sheng's expression darkened—Luo Tian had exceeded his expectations.

"Come out, my pet!" Nie Sheng's hands moved swiftly. A black snake mark flashed on his palms before cold energy echoed through the hall again.

The black snake's mark shimmered, and two black snakes emerged from Nie Sheng's hands. Their bodies expanded rapidly, instantly growing to dozens of feet long. Fortunately, the hall appeared small from outside but was vast within—otherwise, it could not contain these two beasts.

"Hiss... Hisss..." The crimson snake tongues flicked repeatedly. Two black snakes gazed at Nie Sheng before rushing toward each other.

"Buzz..." In Luo Tian's stunned gaze, the two black snakes merged into one body.

"Double-Headed Snake?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly. He sensed a half-True Immortal aura from the double-headed snake.

"Troublesome... but as I suspected, his techniques are nearly exhausted," Luo Tian mused, watching the black double-headed snake with fierce eyes.

"Xiaojie, are you confident?" Luo Tian communicated with Long Jie. Nie Sheng's techniques were nearly spent, and so were Luo Tian's.

"No problem. Though the double-headed snake's bloodline is strong, it's still much weaker than me. I can handle it," Long Jie replied, his voice laced with excitement. He had not fought in a long time and knew the severity of the situation—even if he could not defeat the double-headed snake, he would have to face it head-on.

"Good!" Hearing Long Jie's response, Luo Tian immediately lifted his arm's Naijuan Dragon Seal. A golden column of light shot into the air, piercing through the hall.

"Roar..." A golden dragon surged forth from Luo Tian's front, roaring with divine light and appearing above his head.

A wave of pressure filled the hall. The dragon's hundred-foot body, golden scales—compared to the double-headed snake, Long Jie was far superior in appearance.

"King Beast!" Nie Sheng's face contorted wildly. He had never expected Luo Tian to have another secret weapon.

"What use is a King Beast? Though its bloodline suppresses, your King Beast is merely at the middle stage of Celestial Immortal. It's too far behind!" Nie Sheng sneered.

"Then what about this?" Luo Tian spoke softly. He then slapped his hand, and a deafening roar echoed. Black lightning surged forth, and the three-headed dog's mighty body thundered into the hall.

"Master..." A cold voice echoed through the hall as the three-headed dog spoke, its three massive heads gazing at Luo Tian.

"Xiaohēi, you can talk now!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with wild joy. He had never expected that after absorbing the彼岸花 (Biyanghua), the three-headed dog's strength had advanced to the late stage of Celestial Immortal and could even speak.

One dragon, one snake, and a three-headed dog occupied much of the hall. The three-headed dog stood alongside Long Jie, and the pressure from the two King Beasts made the double-headed snake tremble. Its two mouths continuously flicked their tongues.

"Kill..." Luo Tian brandished the Zhenxian Brush, wheeling it forth again as he rushed toward Nie Sheng.

"Terrifying... so terrifying! I never expected Tian Di to be this strong! Not only is his strength formidable, but he also has such powerful allies!" Zu Qiu Ming sat cross-legged, his face filled with shock. Luo Tian's techniques had exceeded Zu Qiu Ming's expectations!

"A disciple from the Lower Three Heavens battling a prodigy of the Eternal Life Mountain among the Nine Immortal Mountains to this extent—can anyone believe it?" Zu Qiu Ming and Xiao Yue Tianlang sat in a corner, their eyes watching Luo Tian's renewed battle with Nie Sheng.

The two clashed repeatedly in martial arts and physical strength. Meanwhile, the two ghost kings also fought fiercely. Three massive beasts collided ceaselessly, and the hall momentarily reached a stalemate.

Time passed slowly, and the outcome gradually emerged. Nie Sheng's ghost kings were crushed by the Yugui Seal, with vast black energy devoured by Luo Tian's ghost king. It was merely a matter of time before victory.

As for the beasts, although Long Jie and the three-headed dog were King Beasts with bloodline pressure capable of suppressing beasts, the double-headed snake was a half-True Immortal. None could overcome each other.

The most critical factor remained Luo Tian himself. His strength, whether in physical body or martial arts, was no match for Nie Sheng. In fact, his physique could even suppress Nie Sheng.

However, as time passed, Luo Tian's weaknesses became apparent. Though he was strong, he was merely at the late stage of Celestial Immortal, while Nie Sheng was at its peak.

If it were a regular Celestial Immortal peak, Luo Tian's spiritual energy would suffice. But Nie Sheng was no ordinary person—among the Nine Immortal Mountains, he was renowned. His spiritual energy was incomparable to that of a regular Celestial Immortal peak.

"Luo Tian, you will ultimately die!" Nie Sheng also sensed this situation, his face twisting into a cold smile.

"I will die? What if our ancestor returns?" Luo Tian replied, but his heart sighed in silence.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Nie Sheng's mind stirred. His eyes flashed with anxiety. He and Luo Tian had fought for nearly an hour. If Zang Yunfei and the others were fast enough, they could return at any moment.

"Eternal Life Gate!" Nie Sheng growled. After nearly an hour of battle, both were exhausted. Nie Sheng did not believe Luo Tian had any spiritual energy left to withstand another Eternal Life Gate.

"Truly strong! Do you think I have no spiritual energy left? Who knows?" Luo Tian's lips curled into a cold smile.

"Crash..." A series of black demon seeds flew from Luo Tian's hands. One hundred early-stage Celestial Immortal demon seeds hovered above his head, their black light illuminating his face. Nie Sheng saw the madness in Luo Tian's eyes.

"Come!" Luo Tian took a deep breath, and the black demon seeds were devoured into his body. Within three breaths, one hundred demon seeds vanished.

"Though I don't know what will happen, I'll take the risk!" Luo Tian muttered. These demon seeds were not cultivated by himself but obtained from Long Que—100 early-stage Celestial Immortal demon seeds. These belonged to Guan Hongsheng.

"Buzz..." The black demon seeds rapidly were cultivated by Luo Tian's Daoxin Zongmo. A torrent of pure spiritual energy surged toward his cracked dantian.

Chapter 1946: Seed Demon

One hundred early-stage Celestial Immortal demon seeds were insignificant to Long Que but monumental for Luo Tian.

"Ten... one hundred..." In an instant, the 100 demon seeds transformed into pure cultivation energy, surging into Luo Tian's dantian.

"Crack..." The process was natural, and Luo Tian's dantian finally formed a third Dao inscription, signifying his complete ascension to the peak of Celestial Immortal.

"Ascended! He achieved it without absorbing spiritual energy from the heavens!" Seeing Luo Tian's澎湃 (surging) aura, Nie Sheng's face finally changed. The previous Eternal Life Gate had drained his last spiritual energy—his goal was to end Luo Tian with one strike.

"Buzz..." Black qi spread from Luo Tian's eyes. He gazed at the green door in the sky, and the Zhenxian Brush moved again. Golden characters formed swiftly—this was the sixth style of Zhenxian, "Character Seal."

"Boom..." Thunderous sound echoed through the hall. A violent wave of energy scattered outward, sending Luo Tian and Nie Sheng flying backward, crashing into the hall's walls.

"Roar..." Luo Tian flew out of the wall and rushed toward the surging wave of energy, finding Nie Sheng's position.

At this moment, Nie Sheng was in a pitiful state. His face was pale, bloodstained robes, and his eyes filled with disbelief as he slid from the hall.

Luo Tian moved swiftly, grabbing Nie Sheng's neck with his hand. His body radiated demonic energy as he stared into Nie Sheng's eyes.

"Gurgle..." Nie Sheng locked eyes with Luo Tian, his fear reaching its peak. For the first time in years, Nie Sheng experienced terror—especially seeing Luo Tian's eyes with flowing black script and no emotional fluctuations.

"Daoxin! Zongmo!" Luo Tian roared, black energy spreading from his arms. A series of black script dragons instantly wrapped around Nie Sheng, entering his body and invading his dantian. They gradually transformed into a black demon seed.

"Damn it, Luo Tian! You dare!" Nie Sheng saw the black demon script entering his dantian. It occupied his dantian, gradually forming a black demon seed. He roared furiously but was held by Luo Tian's grip, unable to utter a sound.

"Success!" Luo Tian's lips curled into a sinister smile. He felt Nie Sheng's dantian was completely occupied by the black demon seed. He waved his hand, throwing Nie Sheng to the ground.

"I've been seeded with Daoxin Zongmo!" Nie Sheng's eyes were lifeless. He gazed at Luo Tian, who now stood like a supreme demon lord before him.

"Want to die or live?" Luo Tian's voice was hoarse. His condition wasn't good either, his eyes fixed on Nie Sheng.

"I..." Nie Sheng wanted to act brave but stopped at the words. His eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

"Live!" Nie Sheng gritted his teeth, face flushed red. He had exhausted all his strength and collapsed onto the ground, eyes lifeless as he gazed at Luo Tian.

No one wants to die. Especially with hope—backing the Eternal Life Mountain, he hoped it could save him. This was his last lifeline.

"Then end it!" Luo Tian spoke to Nie Sheng, gazing at the other two battlefields. The three beasts were bloodied but the double-headed snake was more pitiful, having lost one tongue. Long Jie and the three-headed dog were also bloodied but better off than the double-headed snake.

The two ghost kings, under the suppression of the Yugui Seal and the three-headed dog, had already ended their battle before Luo Tian's. His ghost king sat cross-legged on the ground as if refining something.

"Defeated!" Nie Sheng called back the double-headed snake. He knew this battle was a complete defeat. Unless he still had his previous talismans, Luo Tian and everyone in the hall would be annihilated.

But he didn't. They had been consumed by Zang Yunfei and the others earlier. Nie Sheng never imagined he would be defeated in the Lower Three Heavens. This feeling was like a pristine genius being knocked down by a mountain villager.

With Nie Sheng seeded with Daoxin Zongmo, the hall returned to calm. Only Long Jie, the three-headed dog, and the double-headed snake emitted heavy breaths.

Wan Youlan's face was pale. She sat on the ground, gazing at Luo Tian seated cross-legged. She never expected Luo Tian to be so powerful—so much that even Nie Sheng was no match.

She had been fighting Diao Dezhu while observing Luo Tian and Nie Sheng's battle. She knew the true outcome was determined by their fight.

"Luo Tian!" Zu Qiu Ming stood up. After time had passed, he had recovered. Except for the ghost kings seated cross-legged, Zu Qiu Ming was the most intact among them.

While being awed by Luo Tian's strength, Zu Qiu Ming also observed Luo Tian's condition. He could sense that the demon seeds Luo Tian had consumed were different from those in his body. He felt no sensation, meaning the demon seeds Luo Tian had swallowed were not from himself.

"Big brother!" As Zu Qiu Ming called out, the people in the hall also noticed Luo Tian's abnormality.

At this moment, Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground. Black qi surrounded his body. His body trembled violently.

...

On Huantian Island, in the Huantian Inn, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged. His face was filled with joy as he exclaimed: "Who dared to devour my demon seeds? Then I won't be polite!"

If Luo Tian saw this middle-aged man, he would recognize him immediately. This was Guan Hongsheng, the one who had terrified Luo Tian.

"Come to me!" Guan Hongsheng formed seals with his hands. Though far from Shenglong Sect, he could still sense the presence of demon seeds. This was the terrifying nature of Daoxin Zongmo—once a seed is planted, if the one who planted it has any malicious intent, the practitioner can sense it.

Luo Tian had previously been able to break Daoxin Zongmo by chance. Guan Hongsheng hadn't cared, as he didn't believe anyone could break Daoxin Zongmo. At that time, Guan Hongsheng had already planted tens of thousands of demon seeds. People tried to break Daoxin Zongmo daily, so he hadn't taken it seriously. If Guan Hongsheng had cared, Luo Tian would have had to put in much more effort to break it.

Guan Hongsheng sat cross-legged, his hands clenching fiercely. An invisible pull was instantly sensed by Luo Tian.

At this moment, Luo Tian's three-cracked golden dantian was filled with countless black script patterns. They pulled at his dantian, trying to pull it out of his body.

"Return!" Luo Tian roared in his heart, struggling with the hundreds of black script patterns. He also recalled the Yugui Seal, trying to replace his dantian. Seven-colored flames burned fiercely in Luo Tian's dantian.

"Ahh..." Extreme pain invaded Luo Tian's entire body. Five black script patterns had already made him wish for death. Now, a hundred of them—Luo Tian could barely withstand it. His golden-black spiritual dantian trembled violently within his dantian, ready to burst out of his body.

"Still resisting!" Guan Hongsheng's brows furrowed slightly. He hadn't expected the opponent to be so tenacious. Suddenly, he stood up and extended his hand toward the void.

"Break!" Luo Tian roared. The Yugui Seal and seven-colored flames surged again, grinding down the black script patterns. However, their speed was slow.

"Damn it, kid! Why did you end up like this while I was asleep? You're heartless for swallowing those demon seeds. Were they something you could use? You're such a fool!" Just as Luo Tian was about to give up, Long Que's voice echoed in his mind, shocking him.

"Master, help me!" Luo Tian knew Long Que would have a solution. After all, he had devoured the tens of thousands of demon seeds Guan Hongsheng planted.

"I have no obligation to help you!" However, Long Que's voice made Luo Tian almost choke.

"Master, please help! We've been through so much!" Luo Tian mentally cried out, hoping Long Que would intervene.

"I've helped you so many times! I taught you Dragon-Subduing Prison and Daoxin Zongmo. You still look so dead, I'm disappointed in you. Every time I have to clean up your mess, I don't have the time!" Long Que spoke softly.

Hearing Long Que's words, Luo Tian fell silent. Long Que was right—Long Que owed him nothing; instead, he owed Long Que a lot.

"Thank you, Master!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He no longer sought help from Long Que but focused on stabilizing his dantian.

"Break... break..." Black script patterns continuously disintegrated, but the golden-black spiritual dantian kept moving. It was just a hair's breadth away from bursting out of Luo Tian's body. If it did, he knew he was done. In his own body, it was his battlefield. If it exited, then all his cultivation would be useless.

"Ji Yuan Book!" Luo Tian suddenly recalled his last hope—the Ji Yuan Book. The Ji Yuan Book had never let him down!

"Buzz..." The next moment, a humming sound echoed. Golden paper suddenly shrank and rushed through Luo Tian's meridians into his dantian.

"This is!" As the Ji Yuan Book appeared, Long Que who had prepared to act stopped. His eyes flashed with intense light as he gazed at the golden book.

"Give me a cut!" A gray soul also appeared in Luo Tian's dantian, his hands forming seals and pressing onto the golden Ji Yuan Book.

"Buzz..." An overwhelming pressure filled Luo Tian's dantian. The golden pages seemed like a sharp blade, slicing through the black script patterns pulling at his dantian.

The next moment, golden light rose in Luo Tian's dantian. The black script patterns were severed by the Ji Yuan Book, faster than even the seven-colored flames and Yugui Seal.

"Eighty... sixty..." Within thirty breaths, those black script patterns were completely turned into dark mist, floating in Luo Tian's dantian.

"Buzz..." Long Que opened his mouth and sucked the remaining dark mist into his Yu Shou Seal. Luo Tian's golden-black spiritual dantian was once again suspended at the center of his dantian.

"Luo Tian!" As the black script patterns disappeared, Guan Hongsheng suddenly opened his eyes and shouted.

Chapter 1947: Preparing for the Heavenly Struggle

"It's you! Again it's you!" Guan Hongsheng's face twisted with hatred. This was the person he hated most in his life, second only to the one who took away his demon seeds.

"Return!" Guan Hongsheng snarled, suppressing the Ji Yuan Book in his storage ring. His eyes were filled with intense hatred.

"What are you?" Guan Hongsheng sat cross-legged again, muttering to himself. He took out the golden book radiating divine light.

"Originally, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have resisted that damned True Immortal's trial!"

"Although Luo Tian is your master, now I am half of your master. You want to return? You need my permission!"

"Luo Tian, wait! When I've mastered this golden book, I'll find you to avenge myself. I never expected there was an old True Immortal at the later stage. I hope to kill you right now in your so-called Shenglong Sect!"

...

On the other side, Zang Yunfei and the others appeared at the teleportation array on Huantian Island. As they exited the teleportation array, they rushed out of Huantian Island toward Shenglong Sect.

"I wonder how it went! If Nie Sheng escaped, we would be doomed!" The three of them, who hadn't sweated in hundreds of years, now had cold sweat on their faces. They used all their strength, wishing to return to Shenglong Sect as soon as possible.

Half a day's journey with their full strength finally brought them back to Shenglong Sect. Upon entering the sect, they rushed directly toward the hall.

"Grand Elder!" As Zang Yunfei and the others appeared in the sky, those guarding outside the hall—Li Changfeng and others—were shocked. They had just heard their Grand Elders transmitting messages inside the hall, but now they were rushing back from afar.

"There's nothing wrong!" Seeing Li Changfeng and others still outside, Zang Yunfei and the others sighed in relief. At least Nie Sheng hadn't left the hall yet.

"Go back!" Zang Yunfei shouted, not wanting too many people around to cause chaos.

"Yes!" Li Changfeng and others were confused but followed Zang Yunfei's orders. They flew to their respective residences with puzzled expressions.

"What's going on inside?" Zhao TieLong asked, looking at the golden barrier still surrounding the hall.

"Never mind. Let's open the barrier first, or it'll be too late!" Zang Yunfei spoke seriously. He and Zhao TieLong and Pei Jianping also nodded, sending out seals from their hands to open the barrier.

"Buzz..." This barrier was set by the three of them. Only they could open it. Within ten breaths, the golden barrier vanished.

"Open!" The three of them spread out in three directions, surrounding the hall. Zang Yunfei extended his hand and pushed it open.

"Clang..." The massive door opened. Zang Yunfei and the others immediately saw into the hall, their minds reeling.

"Old Zang! You're back! It's really slow. Are you trying to suffocate us?" A mocking voice echoed. Luo Tian, looking battered, walked out of the hall with Nie Sheng, Wan Youlan, and Zu Qiu Ming.

"Success?" Zang Yunfei, Zhao TieLong, and Pei Jianping saw Nie Sheng following Luo Tian. Their faces turned to joy instantly, eyes filled with disbelief.

They had prepared for the worst but Luo Tian had actually succeeded. Nie Sheng was a prodigy of the Eternal Life Mountain in the Upper Three Heavens. Luo Tian had actually subdued him. Though they didn't know what method he used, the result was complete.

"Alright, you can go. Remember what I said!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Wan Youlan and Nie Sheng. After recovering in the hall, he had also implanted Daoxin Zongmo on Wan Youlan.

Moreover, Luo Tian was afraid Nie Sheng would panic and not take it seriously. He had only asked for Wan Youlan to leave, promising never to trouble him again.

"Good!" Nie Sheng replied. His eyes glared at Zang Yunfei and the others. If it weren't for them, he would have used his methods to crush Luo Tian and his father's and Eternal Life Immortal King's techniques.

After speaking, Nie Sheng left without looking back with Wan Youlan, disappearing from Luo Tian's group's sight.

"Master, what do we do?" As Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan flew out of Shenglong Sect, Wan Youlan asked Nie Sheng with a depressed face. She was desperate now—Nie Sheng had failed in the river.

"Silence, you bitch. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be in this situation!" Nie Sheng slapped Wan Youlan across the face. His face was dark and terrifying.

"Return to Eternal Life Mountain. I don't believe my Eternal Life Mountain can't solve Daoxin Zongmo!" Nie Sheng spoke fiercely, leading Wan Youlan toward the Huantian Sea.

"Kid, how did you do it?" Zang Yunfei, Zhao TieLong, and Pei Jianping surrounded Luo Tian, looking at him like a monster. They kept asking.

"First, I fought with him and made him submit. Then I used my three-inch tongue to persuade him!" Luo Tian smiled high-mindedly, looking at Zang Yunfei's group with a superior air. He could now understand Diao Dezhu's sense of superiority.

"Get lost..." The three of them kicked Luo Tian out. Who would believe such a simple method? If it were so easy, they wouldn't have been so cautious.

However, the three of them didn't press further. Everyone had their secrets. Luo Tian's secret was no surprise to them, as long as he didn't harm them or Shenglong Sect.

"Next is the Heavenly Struggle!" The three of them sighed deeply, eyes filled with excitement.

Luo Tian returned to his residence. A smile appeared on his face. No matter the cost, he had finally resolved everything.

"Need to keep cultivating! I have a way to break Daoxin Zongmo. Maybe Nie Sheng or Eternal Life Mountain has a way too. Fear the thousand, fear the one!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

"Kid, don't worry. You could break it because you have the Human Flame. You've cultivated the Yugui Seal! These two things are hard to obtain in the entire spiritual world!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Hmm." Luo Tian nodded. He didn't know that Nie Sheng's father, Nie Yuntian, also had a Guigu Mandate and cultivated the Yugui Seal.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and a black halberd appeared in his hand—Yomeng Halberd. He hadn't taken anything else from Nie Sheng, only the Yomeng Halberd.

"This Yomeng Halberd has a similar aura to Yang Huanyu's Yomeng Halberd. The only difference is its grade!"

"Never mind. If I have a chance, and meet that ghost general, I'll know!" Luo Tian muttered softly, his eyes filled with confusion.

"Regarding cultivation, I can't improve further for now. Only techniques, martial arts, and weapons!" Luo Tian muttered softly.

"The Heavenly Struggle is less than a year away. I'll improve other techniques first!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and a black longbow appeared in his hand.

"If it had a bowstring, it could become an upper-grade spiritual weapon. It would be my secret card. However, using it would raise suspicion!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with depth.

"Kid, want to get this bowstring?" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Of course!" Luo Tian nodded, his eyes brightening. Long Que spoke these words—he must know where to get the bowstring.

"You can use that little eel's dragon sinew. Though it hasn't grown yet, it's definitely enough for the bowstring!" Long Que replied, almost making Luo Tian curse.

"Middle Three Heavens. I remember I killed a dragon king in the Death Desert. I was in a hurry then and didn't take its corpse. You can check it if you have time!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him smile again.

"I'll check. There's nothing else to do anyway. After all, I still need to collect demon seeds for the master!" Luo Tian muttered softly and decided to go to the Middle Three Heavens.

"However, I need to prepare some things. After all, the Middle Three Heavens are different from the Lower Three Heavens. I don't know what dangers might come!" Luo Tian quickly made up his mind, planning to eliminate bandits and collect demon seeds while repaying Long Que's debt, gradually entering the Middle Three Heavens.

In the following days, Luo Tian continuously refined elixirs and studied with Xuan Dan to refine elixirs. Occasionally, he returned to the Disciplinary Hall to report, and life was relatively peaceful.

Half a month later, Luo Tian packed his belongings. He bid farewell to Zang Yunfei and the others, promising to return before the Heavenly Struggle. He then left Shenglong Sect with a thousand-illusion mask, his appearance changed. He wore a blood-red cloak, radiating an ominous aura. In his hand was a jade slip recording the names of bandits in the Lower Three Heavens.

"Push forward relentlessly. Let the bandits of the Lower Three Heavens tremble!" Diao Dezhu stood on Luo Tian's shoulder, confident and proud. Chen Zhanbiao stood behind Luo Tian. The two—eagle and man—flew toward Huantian Island.

With Luo Tian's departure, Shenglong Sect also entered a period of calm development. A name began to circulate in the Lower Three Heavens—Xue Zang (Blood Burial).

This Blood Burial was Luo Tian's alias. He continuously eliminated bandits, leaving his name behind.

"This Blood Burial is truly a good person. He wiped out our Tianxiong Gang!"

"Yes, it's really great. We can finally live peacefully now!" People kept spreading the word. The bandits of the Lower Three Heavens became more cautious, fearing Blood Burial would target them.

A month later, Luo Tian finally gathered enough demon seeds for Long Que. His body radiated blood qi as he appeared outside Huantian Island.

Chapter 1948: Traveling Together

Luo Tian's appearance immediately caught the attention of those surrounding Huantian Island. However, upon seeing his blood qi and aura, they knew this person was no easy opponent.
