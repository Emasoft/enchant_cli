Two men were stunned as Long Jie's massive dragon body instantly reached Jin Jingtian's front, golden dragon tail swishing through the void toward the weakened Jin Jingtian.

"Half-Step Saint!" Song Yongkang was equally shocked. He knew Long Jie had only recently ascended to the Transcendent realm a few days ago. Yet in just several days, Long Jie had already become a Half-Step Saint.

"Monstrous!" Song Yongkang sighed inwardly. He had thought Luo Tian was already terrifying enough, but now he realized Long Jie, the younger brother of the Dragon Clan, was even more formidable. His cultivation speed made Song Yongkang feel ashamed. These days, he had also been pondering the stone walls of Tongtian Mountain but achieved little. He estimated it would take him at least ten years to reach the Half-Step Saint level.

"Little Dragon, do you think you can kill me?" Jin Jingtian's words carried disdain but his eyes were grave. After all, Jin Jingtian's strength had declined greatly; he had no confidence against Long Jie and was even slightly inferior.

As Long Jie's massive dragon tail appeared before Jin Jingtian, Jin Jingtian dared not be careless. He extended a golden sacred power hand to grasp Long Jie's tail.

But Jin Jingtian underestimated Long Jie and overestimated himself. The Dragon Clan's greatest strength was their formidable physical body, something Jin Jingtian in his current state could not withstand.

The golden dragon tail struck Jin Jingtian's arm, instantly shattering it and colliding with his body.

"Crack..." The sound of breaking echoed under the starry sky, shaking people's hearts.

Chapter 913: Mountain-Sea Seal

Beyond the starry sky of Tongtian Continent, Long Jie's golden dragon tail struck Jin Jingtian with overwhelming might. The sound of breaking echoed under the stars, leaving people in shock—even Du Hongtao and Lu Han were stunned that Long Jie had become so powerful.

Jin Jingtian's reborn body, still fresh from resurrection, cracked again, hinting at a potential transformation into blood mist. If that happened, Jin Jingtian might truly perish.

Remembering, Jin Jingtian was only a novice Saint; he could not endlessly regenerate by bleeding. Even Saints at the peak could not sustain endless rebirths. Each regeneration caused a slight decline in cultivation, until it was no longer possible.

At this moment, Jin Jingtian had reached the Half-Step Saint level—his cultivation was at that critical point. If he collapsed, whether he could regenerate remained uncertain.

Jin Jingtian's face finally showed fear; his body was at its limit, trembling with emotion. Yet Jin Jingtian was no ordinary man; after a brief crackling, his body stopped breaking but suffered another heavy wound. He was no match for Long Jie's overwhelming might.

"Die!" A thunderous dragon roar echoed, carrying the unique pressure of a superior being. Long Jie's massive eyes turned blood red and charged toward Jin Jingtian again.

"Lu Xiong, Du Xiong, save me!" Jin Jingtian no longer cared about pride; compared to life, what was pride worth?

Du Hongtao and Lu Han naturally could not ignore it. Their eyes showed admiration as two golden hands emerged from their bodies, binding Long Jie and rendering him immobile.

"Let me go, or you'll regret it!" Facing the combined might of two Saints, Long Jie was still no match but remained oddly calm. His massive eyes gazed at Du Hongtao and Lu Han, his voice cold as it echoed under the stars.

"Ugh..." Du Hongtao and Lu Han were momentarily stunned; they had sensed a dangerous aura from Long Jie, even one that threatened their lives. It felt as if they were confronting an invincible king, forbidden from desecration.

But it was only a momentary illusion; they felt confused, thinking it was an error in perception.

"Release him!" Luo Tian's face darkened as he recovered after a brief respite, reappearing before the crowd.

Seeing Luo Tian's return, they waved their hands and released Long Jie but stood in front of Jin Jingtian.

"Luo Tian, come with us. We only want to host you for a few days. Your current state makes it easy for us to capture you!" Du Hongtao smiled gently, addressing Luo Tian.

They could sense Luo Tian's current state was dire; although he remained a Saint, his strength had been greatly depleted. He could not match Du Hongtao and Lu Han.

"I said you can't take me!" Luo Tian's face remained calm, his body straight as confidence radiated from him.

"Oh? I'm curious—what can you do now to turn the tide? You've already proven your monstrous talent by nearly killing Jin Jingtian. Don't be reckless, young man! If Gu Tianshu were alive, call him out. If not, you've offended the three great sects and must be punished!" Du Hongtao smiled lightly, stepping forward to seize Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The golden crackling spear landed in Luo Tian's hand, a battle spirit emerging from him. He swung the spear, creating countless spear shadows around him, dazzling and lighting up the starry sky.

"Ah! Interesting—didn't know this martial art was your creation. It truly is terrifying, but how much of its power can you unleash in this state?" Du Hongtao smiled and waved his hand, a copper seal appearing in his palm. He tossed it into the sky.

"Mountain-Sea Seal!" Lu Han's face changed; he hadn't expected Du Hongtao to use his sacred artifact against Luo Tian in such a state.

The Mountain-Sea Sect and the Golden Toad Sect each had their strengths: the Golden Toad Sect excelled in physical strength, while the Mountain-Sea Sect was renowned for its martial arts. The Fire Sect excelled in cultivation techniques, each with their own advantages.

The palm-sized Mountain-Sea Seal expanded under Du Hongtao's control, appearing above Luo Tian, obviously intending to crush him.

Indeed, Du Hongtao was confident in this strike; Luo Tian's current state could not withstand it. Even if he didn't die, he would be severely wounded. Du Hongtao did not believe that the formidable Gu Tianshu would allow Luo Tian to be wounded.

Tremendous winds surged beneath the bronze Mountain-Sea Seal, with green lightning swirling around it as it pressed down on Luo Tian.

"Truly troublesome," Luo Tian sighed, coughing lightly, his voice devoid of sorrow or joy. He held the golden spear and launched a series of spear shadows.

"Kid, your martial art is strong, but it still falls short against my Mountain-Sea Seal!" Du Hongtao smiled confidently and pressed his hand into the void.

"Buzz..." As Du Hongtao pressed, overwhelming pressure instantly invaded Luo Tian's mind, slowing his movements.

"Vajra Attack! Wind and Cloud Spear Technique!" Luo Tian roared, finally unleashing his newly created spear technique amidst the descending seal and infused it with the Vajra Attack.

A golden storm swept across the starry sky, even shaking Tongtian Mountain beneath them, leaving its people in shock.

"Truly terrifying is the Vajra Attack! I didn't expect Luo Tian's martial art to display such power in this state!" Lu Han sighed, gazing at the golden spear storm below.

Song Yongkang and Long Jie felt a powerful suction, as if even their souls could be absorbed. They were overwhelmed.

Luo Tian had previously used the Wind and Cloud Spear Technique but without the Vajra Attack. Now, its power was three times stronger than before.

"Still not in top form," Luo Tian sighed, knowing that the power he could unleash now was already remarkable.

Although Luo Tian and Jin Jinglong had fought with their bodies, the consumption of sacred power was not great. However, they still suffered heavy injuries and could not unleash their full strength. The Vajra Attack that usually delivered three times the power now only reached two and a half times.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed in people's ears as the Wind and Cloud Spear Technique collided with Du Hongtao's sacred artifact, producing a collision sound.

Sparks flew as golden spear shadows were shattered by the Mountain-Sea Seal. Each shadow could destroy a Transcendent-level opponent, repeatedly striking the seal and leaving cracks, but they instantly healed.

"Indeed stronger than Jin Jingtian's martial art!" Luo Tian sighed, watching his Wind and Cloud Spear Technique weaken.

Luo Tian knew that the Wind and Cloud Spear Technique infused with Vajra Attack could surpass the fifth strike of Seven Demon Blades. It was only a step away from the sixth, making it his second powerful attack.

"It seems I'll have to unleash my demonic state. I wonder how strong it can make me at this Saint's initial stage!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, gazing at the Mountain-Sea Seal that had nearly subdued the golden storm.

"Ten... a hundred..." Golden spear shadows kept breaking, transforming into wind blades that sliced through the void and vanished.

"Kid, don't struggle; this is just my usual technique. You're already struggling so much—imagine if I went all out, you wouldn't feel so comfortable!" Du Hongtao smiled, gazing toward Tongtian Mountain.

"Without trying, how would you know?" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly, a dangerous aura radiating from him, causing Du Hongtao and the others to change expressions.

"Hmph, sharp-tongued kid. Considering this situation, Gu Tianshu must be dead. If he were alive, his disciple being pushed to this point would not have remained inactive!" Jin Jinglong's eyes showed killing intent. Being forced into such a position by this junior made him lose face, especially with their unresolved grudge. New and old hatreds made Jin Jingtian despise Luo Tian.

"Sigh, I guess I'll have to subdue you first!" Du Hongtao sighed, his voice carrying a touch of reluctance but his hands radiated golden light as he poured sacred power into the Mountain-Sea Seal, shaking people's minds.

"Mountain-Sea Seal, one strike to subdue the universe!" Du Hongtao roared, his voice echoing through the stars.

"Is it the Mountain-Sea Three Seals? Does Du Hongtao want to end Luo Tian's life?" Lu Han's face changed upon hearing Du Hongtao's words.

"Ha! Well done!" Jin Jingtian smiled with satisfaction, knowing the terror of Du Hongtao's technique and laughing loudly.

"Pressure!" As Du Hongtao infused golden sacred power into the Mountain-Sea Seal, Luo Tian felt a massive crisis.

"It seems I'll have to use my full strength after all!" Luo Tian smiled, planting his crackling spear into the void and changing his hands.

"Boom..." Black thunder accompanied by black demonic energy radiated from Luo Tian, his crystalline body gradually darkened as if being infiltrated by ink.

"Crash..." The ocean-like whirlpool in his dantian suddenly reversed, forming waves of black sea that battered within it.

Chapter 914: Three Seals Shake the Divine

Under the starry sky of Tongtian Continent, Luo Tian emitted a terrifying aura that made people shudder. This was his first time entering the demonic state since becoming a Saint, so he didn't know how strong it would make him.

As Luo Tian entered the demonic state, the sky darkened further, as if a demon king had emerged. Luo Tian was completely wrapped in black mist, his formidable body healing thoroughly with the demonic energy's circulation, allowing him to reach his strongest state.

Meanwhile, Du Hongtao's Mountain-Sea Seal radiated brilliant golden light, with countless mountain and sea illusions emerging from his hands, etched into the seal's surface to gradually enhance its power.

"This Luo Tian still has such a technique!" Lu Han and Jin Jingtian's faces finally changed. They knew Luo Tian's current state was beyond their individual abilities to subdue.

"I'll go help!" Lu Han sighed with a bitter smile, thinking it would be easy to capture him but now facing this result.

Lu Han's words received no objection from Jin Jingtian; he knew now was not the time to be stubborn. The current Luo Tian felt too terrifying, and a Saint at the initial stage would easily be crushed by him.

Luo Tian clenched his fists, a confident aura radiating from him as he gazed at Du Hongtao's Mountain-Sea Seal in the sky.

"Subdue!" Du Hongtao hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so strong; as Luo Tian looked at the seal, it seemed pulled downward.

The massive Mountain-Sea Seal cracked through space toward Luo Tian, who had black hair and a fierce expression. Black demonic energy enveloped his fists as he struck the seal, which was disproportionate in size to his body.

"Add me, is it enough!" Lu Han laughed loudly, golden sacred power spreading from his body. The starry sky's temperature dropped instantly, causing Long Jie and Song Yongkang to shiver involuntarily. Their eyes were filled with fear.

They were one Transcendent and one Half-Step Saint, but against a Saint at the initial stage's battle, they could do nothing but watch.

The collision between Luo Tian and the Mountain-Sea Seal caused a massive explosion, shaking the stars. Luo Tian's face was arrogant as he stood under the stars, his body surrounded by black mist, like a supreme demon lord.

Meanwhile, Du Hongtao's Mountain-Sea Seal crashed backward with numerous cracks forming and slowly healing.

Du Hongtao's face was pale, sensing the seal's damage. He looked at Luo Tian with disbelief.

"Freeze the world!" As Du Hongtao was stunned by Luo Tian's strength, Lu Han transformed into a golden storm, freezing the entire starry sky and rushing toward Luo Tian.

"This is more interesting!" Luo Tian shook off the ice shards on his body, black demonic sword slowly凝聚, slicing with the Vajra Attack. A shocking blade of light rushed toward the golden storm.

Another explosion, three black blades struck the golden icy storm, neutralizing Lu Han's attack.

"Powerful!" At this moment, the three men's gazes toward Luo Tian changed. They had thought it would be easy to take him, but now he was this strong.

Jin Jingtian's face was extremely grim; he regretted his impulsive decision to fight Luo Tian alone. If he had known how strong Luo Tian was, he would have fought together with Du Hongtao and Lu Han.

Now, after entering the demonic state, Luo Tian's injuries had recovered seven-tenths, while Jin Jingtian's cultivation had dropped and his body was shattered. He could only watch the three battling.

"Mountain-Sea Seal, two seals to shake the heavens!" As Lu Han's attack was neutralized by Luo Tian, Du Hongtao's attack凝聚 again toward Luo Tian—this was the second seal of the Mountain-Sea Seal.

In view, the massive Mountain-Sea Seal expanded again, resembling a star with overwhelming waves and complex patterns that dazzled the eyes. A familiar aura filled Luo Tian's heart, the one capable of sealing heaven itself.

"Want to seal me?" Luo Tian gripped his black demonic sword and directly unleashed the fifth strike of Seven Demon Blades, slicing through space like a black lightning bolt toward the Mountain-Sea Seal that could subdue heaven.

"Freeze Extreme Change!" Lu Han moved his hands slightly, a smile on his face as his aura surged. A series of golden seals emerged and finally landed on him.

"Boom..." At the same time, Lu Han's cultivation suddenly surged, his body seeming to dominate even suppressing Luo Tian's aura.

"This is the aura of a Saint at the middle stage!" Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian's eyes showed disbelief as they gazed at Lu Han, surprised he had such a secret technique to elevate his cultivation to the middle stage.

They had thought Lu Han's cultivation was the weakest among them, but now they realized he had hidden deeply.

"Don't be nervous; it's just the Freeze Extreme Change I've been pondering recently! It can only briefly reach the middle stage of a Saint!" Lu Han, noticing their surprise, explained.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly; he felt it was quite challenging. If it were a Saint at the initial stage, even against Jin Jingtian, he would have confidence in subduing him. But a Saint at the middle stage made him truly uncertain. From Lu Han's aura alone, it was much stronger than his.

"Boom..." As people were stunned, the black demonic sword collided with the Mountain-Sea Seal, creating a terrifying wave that made people regain their senses.

"I should deal with Du Hongtao first!" Luo Tian glanced at Lu Han, calculating in his mind. He gripped the black demonic sword and gathered his strength.

The Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum was instantly summoned, no longer holding back. Combined with the Vajra Attack, Luo Tian directly unleashed the sixth strike of Seven Demon Blades.

The black demonic sword shattered on the Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum's surface, then reassembled. Five times the attack power formed a world-destroying black blade that flew toward Du Hongtao.

"Damn!" Du Hongtao felt a bit panicked, seeing the world-destroying blade. A threat to his life instantly invaded his mind.

"Can it be blocked?" Jin Jingtian's heart trembled, his eyes showing a hint of fear as he gazed at Luo Tian. Emotions he hadn't felt in years surfaced today due to Luo Tian.

Lu Han's eyes narrowed slightly, watching the black blade. Even in his current state, he felt a threat.

Luo Tian had once used this strike to fight against the divine clan's Saint Sun Shengjie when he was a Half-Step Saint. Now, as a true initial-stage Saint, his power had risen another level, making this strike much stronger than before. It could kill an initial-stage Saint without giving them a chance to regenerate.

Faced with life-threatening danger, Du Hongtao's face turned wild. The Mountain-Sea Seal, just repaired, buzzed again with supreme will and emitted golden light.

"Mountain-Sea Seal, three seals to shake the divine!" Du Hongtao roared, revealing his strongest attack against Luo Tian.

"Mountain-Sea's third seal! Du Hongtao has mastered it!" Jin Jingtian, standing at a distance, gazed at Du Hongtao's third seal technique with admiration.

The Mountain-Sea Seal was not a personal artifact of Du Hongtao but an ancestral inheritance passed down through generations. It had three seals, each with terrifying power capable of severely wounding or even killing an initial-stage Saint.

Although Luo Tian had handled it seemingly easily before, only he could do so. If a regular initial-stage Saint like the divine clan's Sun Shengjie faced Mountain-Sea's three seals, it would be a complete碾压.

Now Du Hongtao used the third seal; few Mountain-Sea Sect masters had mastered it. Its power was terrifying, and with the sect's inheritance, it was said that one generation of masters used the third seal to kill a late-stage Saint. Hence, the Mountain-Sea Seal's name: "Three Seals Shake the Divine."

Both martial arts were world-destroying, radiating overwhelming pressure toward each other. The thunderous explosion echoed in people's ears.

Under the stunned gazes, the black blade pierced through and struck the Mountain-Sea Seal, creating a massive explosion. Long Jie and Song Yongkang's faces turned pale; even from afar, they could feel the destructive energy.

Gray waves surged, obscuring people's vision and even their spiritual senses, leaving them unaware of what happened.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing his sixth strike's power was gradually decreasing, making him uneasy. After all, this was his strongest technique now. If he couldn't subdue Du Hongtao, there was no way to deal with Lu Han, who had just used a secret technique to reach the middle stage.

"Buzz..." The gray waves surged for several breaths, and Luo Tian's face suddenly improved, his eyes filled with amusement as he gazed at Du Hongtao.

In contrast, Du Hongtao's face turned pale instantly, his eyes filled with shock as he gazed at the swirling gray waves.

Chapter 915: The Seventh Strike

Under the starry sky, gray waves surged. Luo Tian stood there with amusement in his eyes, while Du Hongtao's face was pale to the extreme, filled with intense disbelief as he gazed at the swirling gray waves.

"What's wrong?" Jin Jingtian and others frowned, gazing at Du Hongtao's pale face.

They knew only Luo Tian and Du Hongtao could sense the result of their clash, so they were puzzled by the two. However, seeing Du Hongtao's face, their minds had already formed a conclusion.

"Spit..." Du Hongtao spat blood, clearly wounded. His eyes gazed at Luo Tian, shifting from shock to bitterness.

"Buzz..." Finally, under people's waiting gaze, a strand of black blade pierced through the gray waves and rushed toward Du Hongtao with thunderous power.

The sound of destruction was overwhelming, though it had been weakened by the Mountain-Sea Seal's resistance. Still, it brought immense pressure to people.

The black blade instantly arrived before Du Hongtao and struck his pale face.

In the next moment, Du Hongtao was annihilated by this strike, turning into a mist of blood floating in the sky. He followed Jin Jingtian's footsteps.

Song Yongkang gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with reverence. Though he was much older than Luo Tian, no one could deny Luo Tian's strength. Even Lu Han and others had nothing to say. This was truly a prodigy, surpassing his peers and even challenging old-generation masters.

Blood slowly coalesced; Du Hongtao appeared in people's sight, his face pale and filled with fear. His cultivation had dropped to the Half-Step Saint level.

Du Hongtao now deeply understood Luo Tian's terrifying nature. If the Mountain-Sea Seal hadn't absorbed most of his demonic sword's power, he would have been in real danger. That strike could have taken his life without a chance to regenerate.

"Only you remain!" Luo Tian's face was serious as he gazed at Lu Han, his black demonic sword slowly凝聚. He knew among the three, Lu Han posed the greatest threat to him. Yet he felt no killing intent from Lu Han.

"Lu Xiong, rely on you!" Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao stood together with grim faces, gazing at Lu Han with hope.

"Alright, I'll try my best!" Lu Han's face was calm as he gazed at Luo Tian. A pressure radiated from him, making Luo Tian's face tense.

"I'm still not a match for a Saint at the middle stage!" From his aura alone, Luo Tian knew he was no match for a middle-stage Saint. Even if Lu Han wasn't fully at the middle stage, he was still no match.

"Continue?" Lu Han's golden light flashed as he gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes showing inquiry.

"Let me try; I want to see how much of a gap there is between me and a middle-stage Saint!" Luo Tian clenched his black demonic sword, gathering his aura.

"Good! I can only unleash one attack comparable to a middle-stage Saint, so it's all or nothing!" Lu Han smiled, his eyes filled with admiration.

Nodding slightly, Luo Tian's eyes turned serious. Black mist spread from his body, a terrifying pressure sweeping over the three.

"To counter a middle-stage Saint! I must unleash the seventh strike!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with sharpness, gazing at Lu Han.

Lu Han said nothing and raised his hands, golden seals emerging from his body, swirling around him.

"Buzz..." A sound of clashing echoed as a blue sword appeared above Lu Han's head, its sharp aura making people feel a chill.

"Lu Han has also gone serious! He's used his sacred artifact, the Blazing Fire Sword!" Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian saw the blue sword hovering above Lu Han's head, their faces filled with admiration as they awaited Luo Tian's fate beneath the sword.

Lu Han pressed his finger, and the hovering Blazing Fire Sword emitted waves. It split into two, then four, finally forming nine high swords hovering above Lu Han's head.

"Roar..." Golden seal dragons roared, transforming into nine dragons attached to the nine swords.

At the moment the golden seals attached to the nine Blazing Fire Swords, they instantly expanded, their massive bodies radiating overwhelming waves. They spun above Lu Han's head, creating endless storms that blew his white robe and beard. At this moment, Lu Han looked like a divine being, with the golden storm above him capable of crushing an initial-stage Saint.

"Kid, it's still not too late to surrender! This Nine Heavens Sword God Technique is my Fire Sect's secret technique. Once I unleash it, I can't control it! If I truly injure your life, Master Gu Tianshu will be angry with me!" Lu Han warned, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Lu Han, what do you mean?" Hearing Lu Han's words, Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian's faces turned grim. They heard Lu Han's words, sensing his respect for Luo Tian's life and Gu Tianshu. He didn't want to harm Luo Tian, but rather treated it as a match with a junior.

"Nothing special; this prodigy appearing in my Fire Sect, killing him would be a pity. I don't want the Fire Sect to remain at the second-to-last position in the nine regions!" Lu Han smiled, replying to them.

"You!" Seeing Lu Han openly speaking such words, their faces turned grim. However, the current situation was that they were at a disadvantage. Not only could Lu Han not be defeated by Luo Tian, but even if they wanted to kill them, it would be easy.

"I have never truly surrendered since I entered the cultivation world. There was no surrender before, and there won't be now!" Luo Tian smiled, the sound of thunder echoing from his dantian. Black waves surged from his dantian.

He waved his hand, six black blade shadows flying out of his hands—sixth strike of Seven Demon Blades. Each was fused with the Vajra Attack, each carrying overwhelming power.

But Luo Tian controlled these six blades to circle above his head, then threw the black demonic sword into the sky.

"Respectfully, this is my strongest move. I hope you'll guide me!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Lu Han. He had clearly heard Lu Han's words; since he was polite, Luo Tian would not be cold.

"Seventh Strike!" Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with immense anticipation. He longed to see what power the seventh strike of Seven Demon Blades could achieve.

Luo Tian's dantian spun wildly, his body clearly giving it all. His demonic energy was not held back but poured into the black sword in the sky.

"Seven Strikes Combined, Killing Demons!" Luo Tian announced loudly, his voice carrying a weak aura but his face filled with excitement. Finally, he could unleash the seventh strike of Seven Demon Blades.

As Luo Tian's words ended, the six previous strikes of Seven Demon Blades converged toward one point, forming a black dragon spanning the starry sky. It rushed toward the black sword Luo Tian had thrown into the sky.

Luo Tian's hands formed a gesture, emitting an upper aura that fused the black dragon and the black sword.

Lightning surged, terrifying pressure instantly appeared under the starry sky, matching Lu Han's Nine Heavens Sword God Technique. People were stunned.

Lu Han's eyes narrowed, sighing inwardly for underestimating Luo Tian. He could feel the combined demonic sword's power was terrifying, even in his current state, it would be quite challenging to deal with.

"Terrifying!" Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao gazed at the black sword spanning the starry sky, their eyes finally showing fear.

"Go!" Luo Tian's face was pale as he clenched his hands, striking toward Lu Han's sword storm.

Lu Han's eyes flickered; he pressed his finger, and the golden storm instantly arrived, rushing toward the black sword.

Countless lightning bolts surged in the starry sky, with five elements' storms sending everyone flying far away. Even Luo Tian was swept up by the terrifying storm, countless cracks appearing on his body, making his face instantly pale.

Lu Han's face was also grim; he gazed at the black sword and his Nine Heavens Sword God Technique intertwining, destroying a vast starry sky. He couldn't believe what would happen if he stood in the center.

After about thirty breaths, the starry sky gradually calmed down. Lu Han and Luo Tian's faces turned pale as they gazed at each other.

Both panted heavily, their bodies in a terrible state, with their flesh on the verge of collapse.

"I've told you before—capturing me isn't that simple!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice not loud but exploding like thunder in the minds of Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao.

"Go, I can't handle him!" Lu Han's face carried a bitter smile as he addressed Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian.

Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian were also bitter, inwardly grateful they had come低调. If the previous battle had been seen by others, the three great sects would have truly lost face.

The head of the three great sects, both were beaten to regenerate by blood and had their cultivation dropped. One was evenly matched with him; it would be too embarrassing to spread.

"Want to leave? The Tongtian Sect isn't a big sect, but it's not like you can come and go as you please!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness, gazing at Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao.

"Ah? I'll see what talent the disciple of Gu Tianshu has to dare challenge the head of the three great sects!" Before Luo Tian's words ended, a calm voice echoed from beneath the starry sky. Three old men stepped out of the void, standing under the stars as if they were the masters of this starry region. Their sharp eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 916: Don't Regret It

Under the starry sky, three old men with white hair and a sense of age appeared. Their faces carried smiles as if they were the masters of this starry region, emitting a massive pressure that struck Luo Tian, Long Jie, and Song Yongkang. The three's faces changed.

"Respect the Grandmaster!" Unlike Luo Tian, these three men showed joy as they greeted the old men. They bowed slightly, gazing at the three old men.

"Hmph! You three are actually quite capable; you couldn't even subdue a junior and were beaten to regenerate by blood, with your cultivation dropped. That's truly embarrassing!" One old man radiated green energy and lightly scolded.

"Green sacred power, Saint at the late stage!" Luo Tian saw their aura and the green energy, his eyes widened again as he identified their cultivation.

"Grandmaster! The three great sects' resources!" Song Yongkang's face changed. He hadn't expected to have awakened the Grandmasters of the three great sects.

Song Yongkang, known in the Fire Region, had lived for many years but only knew of the three great sects' deep resources. He had never seen their Grandmasters before.

"Luo Tian?" The three Grandmasters showed no emotion, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration. To have pushed Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao to such a state, Luo Tian's talent and strength were undeniable. Even in other regions, he was an absolute prodigy no one could match. Now, Luo Tian had surpassed the younger generation and could rival old-generation masters.

"Hmm." Luo Tian's face remained calm as he gazed at them, his eyes showing no reverence. He knew they were after Gu Tianshu. Their repeated attempts to trouble him were only to force out Gu Tianshu's strength, seeing what his current level was. Otherwise, with the three great sects' arrogance, he might have already been dead.

"Good! Unfortunately, you're still young; too much sharpness is bad for life. It can cost your life!" One old man spoke, this one being the Grandmaster of the Mountain-Sea Sect, Wang Jianzhou.
