Though he was not a cultivator, his physique was far stronger than an ordinary person. Ning Mu was merely an ordinary woman, her body frail and weak—how could she withstand such a blow? She was felled with great force.

Fury overwhelmed her, and she spat out a jet of black blood. Her pale face gazed at the burly man entering her daughter's room, and sorrow welled up within her.

"Mother!" Ning Yu'er cried out as she saw her mother spitting blood, rushing toward the fallen woman.

But the two men would not let her succeed. Their thick arms blocked Ning Yu'er's path. She was merely an ordinary woman, no match for the two burly men.

After struggling briefly, she was dragged before Shui Xiu Jie. Thinking of her fate, a look of boundless sorrow crossed her face.

"Hmph, truly ungrateful! You force me to resort to violence. It's not too late to regret—serve me well, and I'll treat you kindly. If you refuse, I have a band of fierce subordinates. Once I've finished with you, I won't mind giving you to them!" Shui Xiu Jie's eyes gleamed with excitement as he gazed at Ning Yu'er.

The two men, hearing Shui Xiu Jie's words, wore expressions of excitement. Deep down, they hoped Ning Yu'er would be defiant and refuse Shui Xiu Jie's demands. That way, they too could indulge in her.

"Delusions! If I die, I'll never let you succeed!" Ning Yu'er's frail body writhed like a feral leopard in the men's grip.

"Truly..." Shui Xiu Jie was about to speak when a gust of wind swept past, making him feel as though something had vanished from his surroundings. The wind blew toward Ning Yu'er's room.

Suppressing the strange feeling in his heart, Shui Xiu Jie's expression returned to its former coldness. He barked at the two men, "Bind her and take her to that room! I'll claim her now. Since she refuses my request, I'll let you enjoy her after I'm done!"

"Yes!" The two men shouted in unison, loosening their belts with eager expressions.

"Monsters!" Ning Mu cried out as she saw her daughter bound, despair etched on her face. She lunged at the two men again.

"Crash!" One man, unaware of her approach, was struck in the back, his face contorted with anger.

With a mighty kick, he sent Ning Mu flying again.

He stepped toward Ning Mu, his eyes twisted with menace. "You old hag, you'll die eventually. Today, I'll send you off!"

"No!" Ning Yu'er screamed.

Ning Mu, already weak, could not endure another such blow. If struck solidly, she would surely collapse.

Shui Xiu Jie watched the scene without intervening, even approving of it.

"Whoosh..." A gust of wind returned, but this time Shui Xiu Jie was surprised. His vision blurred as a white figure shot past him, colliding directly with one of the men.

"Crash..." The man's mighty body crashed against a courtyard wall ten zhang away, his chest caved in with a sickening crunch. Blood spewed from his mouth as he lay motionless, clearly dead.

Ning Yu'er's eyes, once filled with despair and tears, now held disbelief as she gazed at the figure wrapped in bandages.

"Who are you?" Shui Xiu Jie's heart trembled, fear flickering across his face as he stared at the bandaged figure. Only a young head was visible.

"Release them. You may die with dignity!" Luo Tian's voice rang out, cold and unyielding.

Hearing this voice, Ning Yu'er's face lit up with excitement. This sound was familiar to her—etched in her memories and dreams.

Luo Tian slowly turned, revealing his true face. After being restored by the Rebirth Pill, he had fully recovered. A gentle smile graced his face as he looked at Ning Yu'er. At that moment, he remembered the mother and daughter he had saved when he first arrived in Tianyuan City.

Seeing Luo Tian's face, Ning Yu'er's mind went blank. This visage she would never forget—eternally embedded in her heart. At that moment, Ning Yu'er seemed to forget she was bound, gazing at Luo Tian with unwavering eyes. To her, he was as a god.

"Don't come closer! If you do, I'll kill her!" Shui Xiu Jie's face was pale with fear as he drew a short knife, pressing it against Ning Yu'er's neck.

"Three breaths. Release her, and you may die with dignity. Otherwise, your death will be most painful!" Luo Tian's eyes held mockery as he gazed at Shui Xiu Jie.

Shui Xiu Jie was merely an ordinary man, no better than an ant in Luo Tian's eyes. Luo Tian had a thousand ways to kill him.

"Delusions! My father is the town's magistrate, and I am a cousin of the Wang family in Tianyuan City!" Shui Xiu Jie's face was drenched in sweat, his knife trembling.

"You have no chance!" Luo Tian's eyes carried regret as a powerful aura surged from him, pressing down on Shui Xiu Jie and the remaining attendant.

"Crash..." The two men, mere ordinary humans, could not withstand Luo Tian's pressure. Even those at the seventh level of body refinement would be crushed by it.

At the moment Luo Tian's aura touched them, they fell to their knees, unable to move a single finger.

Chapter 252: Crush to Death

Luo Tian ignored the two men on the ground, a smile on his face as he approached Ning Yu'er. With a flick of his fingers, the ropes binding her fell away.

"Remember me?" Luo Tian's face softened as he gazed at the kind Ning Yu'er, gently brushing a strand of her disheveled hair.

"Remember! Remember!" Ning Yu'er was awakened by Luo Tian's words, her face alight with excitement. She repeated the word "remember" without knowing what else to say.

"Stupid girl!" Luo Tian lightly patted her head, then turned to Ning Mu.

"Luo... Elder Brother, can you save my mother?" Ning Yu'er's eyes brimmed with hope as she watched Luo Tian approach her mother.

"Rest assured, I'm here!" Luo Tian cast her a reassuring glance before placing his fingers on Ning Mu's wrist. A thread of wood-element spiritual energy, infused with his consciousness, flowed into her body.

A short while later, Luo Tian's face broke into a smile. Ning Mu's condition wasn't severe—merely blocked meridians. But the prolonged blockage required调理 (regulation). With his presence as a pill master, these issues were no problem.

"Madam, I'll treat you now. It may be painful—please endure a little!" Luo Tian spoke softly to Ning Mu.

Ning Mu was already extremely weak, her condition worsened by the kick and her daughter's peril. She could barely speak, but seeing Luo Tian's familiar figure, she smiled faintly. She had met him in Tianyuan City before. She sighed at the coincidence, then whispered, "Cough... Cough... Rest assured, I've endured much hardship in my old age!"

Hearing Ning Mu's reply, Luo Tian extended his consciousness again, guiding it into the blocked meridians. His consciousness transformed into a needle, piercing the blockage with force.

"Ugh..." Ning Mu's face contorted in pain, her features twisted as waves of agony surged through her meridians. Cold sweat drenched her body.

Luo Tian knew this pain was unbearable for an ordinary person, so he quickened his pace. His consciousness-needle moved through Ning Mu's body continuously, and with each pass, wood-element spiritual energy followed to ease her pain.

An hour passed. Luo Tian's forehead was drenched in sweat, though the spiritual energy consumption wasn't great. He had to concentrate fully; human meridians were complex, demanding meticulous care.

"Ugh..." After an hour, Luo Tian exhaled deeply, a smile on his face.

Ning Mu's clothes were soaked in sweat. An hour of torment had left her agonized, but each pain was followed by a refreshing energy that soothed her. Yet the momentary agony felt like death itself.

"Done!" Luo Tian placed a first-grade pill into Ning Mu's mouth, then turned to Ning Yu'er.

Ning Yu'er had watched Luo Tian the entire time, surprised he stood still without moving. She dared not interrupt him. When he turned and said "done," she looked puzzled. Though she knew Luo Tian was powerful, she had never seen anyone heal like this.

"Spit...!" Ning Mu coughed up blood, her face gradually regaining color. Never before had she felt so light, as if all her weakness was expelled.

After Luo Tian placed the pill in her mouth, this feeling intensified. A surge of vitality coursed through her body, nurturing it.

Luo Tian wasn't unwilling to give Ning Mu a higher-grade pill; she was an ordinary person, and he feared she couldn't withstand the potent energy of a second-grade pill.

At that moment, Ning Yu'er approached her mother, watching her face gradually regain color. She knew her mother was truly recovering, and she looked at Luo Tian with admiration on her pretty face.

"Enough! Don't stare at me like that—make me embarrassed. You saved me once, this is karmic retribution!" Luo Tian patted Ning Yu'er's head, his expression gentle.

"Luo Elder Brother, what about them?" Ning Yu'er looked at the two men on the ground, her face puzzled as she asked softly.

Seeing the defeated Shui Xiu Jie, Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He despised such people who abused their status to oppress others. If not for him, Ning Yu'er and her mother's fate would have been unimaginable.

"Of course, kill them. Such people are a curse on this world! Not just him, but his entire family is responsible. Everyone connected to him must die!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with coldness as he strode toward the two men.

Shui Xiu Jie's face was filled with despair. He hadn't expected there to be such a killer in Ning Yu'er's courtyard. The youth's appearance made him realize his father might not even be a match.

After lying on the ground for an hour, his body was numb beyond endurance. He couldn't even move a finger. Now that Luo Tian declared he would kill them, Shui Xiu Jie's mind was shattered. He only hoped his father would come to save him, though he knew it would be futile.

"Yu'er, go help your mother sit inside the house. I'll deal with these two men first!" Luo Tian told Ning Yu'er.

"Ah!" Ning Yu'er nodded obediently, helping her mother up. But now, Ning Mu no longer needed support; her spirit was vibrant, even her sparse white hair turned black and lustrous.

Seeing the mother and daughter enter the house, Luo Tian smiled playfully. Before Shui Xiu Jie could think further, he crushed them with a mighty kick.

"Crash... Crash..." Two muffled sounds echoed as Shui Xiu Jie and the remaining attendant lay lifeless at Luo Tian's feet.

Yet Shui Xiu Jie's face still bore a contemplative expression, pondering whether his father could match Luo Tian.

Luo Tian dragged the two corpses to a corner, then unleashed his long-unused炎龙手 (Blazing Dragon Hand), burning the three corpses. He walked to Ning Yu'er's door, gently knocking on it.

Ning Yu'er naturally knew Luo Tian didn't want her to witness the bloody scene. Hearing his knock, she quickly opened the door, seeing the blazing fire.

"Come on, take me to the magistrate's house. I want to see what this magistrate has that makes him dare let his son behave like this!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness.

Chapter 253: Oppression

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Ning Yu'er's face showed surprise. The magistrate was the town's leader. Though she knew Luo Tian was a cultivator and powerful, she didn't think he could match the middle-aged magistrate. Plus, the magistrate had many allies; Luo Tian was just one person.

"Luo Elder Brother, let's run away!" Ning Yu'er's face showed panic as she stammered.

Hearing this, Luo Tian chuckled, guessing her thoughts. He lightly patted her head: "Don't worry, I'm quite strong. A mere magistrate isn't worth running from."

Seeing Luo Tian's confident gaze, Ning Yu'er recalled that he had connections with the renowned Gu family in Tianyuan City. The Gu family's power was as vast as the sky to her. Thinking of this, her face showed determination. She believed even if Luo Tian died, she would accompany him; dying with Luo Tian was worth it.

Seeing Ning Yu'er's changed expression, Luo Tian spoke again: "Don't think too much. Just lead the way!"

Ning Yu'er said goodbye to her mother and led Luo Tian out of the small courtyard.

The town wasn't large, and in just a moment, Ning Yu'er led Luo Tian to the magistrate's mansion.

Two guards saw Ning Yu'er's arrival and exchanged glances, smiling: "Why didn't you come to us earlier? It would have been better!"

"Yes, from now on, we'll call you 'missus!'" The two gatekeepers laughed.

"Crash... Crash..." Luo Tian's figure appeared before them, and he punched with both fists. The two guards' chests caved in, flying into the courtyard for several zhang before landing on the ground.

"Go back first. I'll deal with these people and come back to you!" Luo Tian ignored the chaos inside the magistrate's mansion, turning to Ning Yu'er with a soft voice.

"I won't!" Ning Yu'er's pretty face showed stubbornness, making Luo Tian smile.

But he wasn't too concerned; the town had no strong warriors. He took out his Nailing Spirit and released Baihu (White Tiger).

"Roar..." Baihu's appearance was a loud roar. Its wounds had long healed; though it looked severely injured, they were just superficial. As a fierce beast, its recovery was fast. Plus, Baihu was a wood-element spiritual energy beast, recovering within half a day.

However, Baihu had been tense in the Nailing Spirit, unsure if Luo Tian could escape two bone-fragmenting middle-level cultivators. Upon appearing, it immediately assumed a battle stance. But soon, seeing the young girl before it, Baihu's expression was terrified. It had never seen a fierce beast before; the ferocious aura alone made it breathless.

"Luo... Elder Brother!" Ning Yu'er's gaze shifted to Luo Tian, her voice trembling. She almost cried.

"Don't fear. He's my friend. Let him protect you for a while!" Luo Tian's voice redirected Baihu's attention to himself.

Seeing Luo Tian unharmed, Baihu was stunned. It hadn't expected Luo Tian to escape two middle-level bone-fragmenting cultivators and still be lively.

"Enough with that worshipful gaze. I'll explain after I finish here. Wait a moment!" Luo Tian smiled, whispering to Baihu.

"Roar..." Baihu surveyed the people in the courtyard, seeing them all as ants. His tiger face showed human-like disdain; it was clear Luo Tian was bullying people. Baihu closed his eyes and lay before Ning Yu'er.

"You stay with him for a while. He's... quite good. Not as fierce as you imagine!" Luo Tian comforted Ning Yu'er, then strode into the courtyard.

At that moment, the courtyard was filled with people. They had all been drawn by the tiger's roar and arrived at the gate, seeing a somewhat frail youth with an icy expression entering. Seeing the fallen guards, they knew this person had come to cause trouble.

"Who are you? Do you know where you are?" A middle-aged man, seemingly a steward, stepped forward with a serious face. Though he didn't know who the youth was, he sensed a terrifying aura from him. He himself was at body-refining level one, renowned in the town.

"Are you the magistrate?" Luo Tian's gaze narrowed at the middle-aged man.

Though he didn't use any aura, this look was like a thunderclap to the steward, leaving him trembling.

"Who are you? What business do you have with our magistrate?" The steward's eyes showed a hint of respect. He knew this youth was someone they couldn't afford to offend.

"I'll kill them all in ten breaths. Those who've done evil, step forward. Otherwise, they'll die!" Luo Tian's cold gaze swept over the dozens of people in the courtyard.

"Why? Who do you think you are?"
"Exactly, don't be so arrogant!"
"We're distant relatives of the Wang family in Tianyuan City!" Hearing Luo Tian's domineering words, the courtyard erupted. They thought this young man was just posturing. In this area, the Wang family was like a local emperor.

"Ten... nine..."
Luo Tian ignored them, drawing his Cracking Heaven Spear and planting it in the ground. His voice was cold:
"Steward, what's your name?" The steward's eyes were heavy with fear as he saw the Cracking Heaven Spear. He knew their magistrate had likely angered someone. Seeing Ning Yu'er standing outside, the steward understood roughly.

Others were different; their eyes showed greed as they gazed at the Cracking Heaven Spear. It felt like an extraordinary weapon, likely used by a cultivator. This greed made some people eager to snatch it.

"Where is our master?" The steward asked softly, his gaze heavy on Luo Tian.
"Four... three..." Luo Tian ignored them, noting those with greed in his mind and speaking again.
"Those who have wronged Ning Yu'er, step forward!" The steward shouted at the dozens behind him.
"Why?"
"I won't stand, you're just a steward who can't control us!" Some behind him spoke disdainfully.
"One." Luo Tian finished the last breath, a cruel smile on his face as he looked at those arguing. He swung the Cracking Heaven Spear.

Chapter 254: Heading to the Wang Family

The Cracking Heaven Spear, like a black dragon, pierced through the steward's throat. At that moment, the steward still gazed at Luo Tian in disbelief.

This act stunned all the Shui family members. Though they looked down on the steward, they knew he was a cultivator renowned in the town, second only to their patriarch.

Yet this frail youth had effortlessly killed him. What was his strength?

But Luo Tian gave them no chance, a look of regret on his face as he walked toward the group with the Cracking Heaven Spear.

In an instant, nearly all of the Shui family's dozens of people—excluding the elderly and children—were killed.

Luo Tian heard their arrogant words and knew they were accustomed to arrogance, looking down on everyone. Plus, their greedy eyes toward his Cracking Heaven Spear and even a hint of killing intent had sealed their fate in his mind.

Luo Tian took a deep breath, looking at the remaining elderly and children who were terrified. A struggle flickered on his face. He naturally understood the principle of eliminating threats, but seeing these trembling people, he repeatedly raised his spear yet couldn't bring himself to strike.

"Where is your patriarch?" Luo Tian asked softly.
"The master has gone to Tianyuan City, to present gifts to the Wang family!" An old woman trembled as she replied.
"The Wang family? The Wang Pengtian family?" Luo Tian asked again, unsure which Wang family was meant.
"Yes, we're distant relatives of the Wang family. That's why we can be the town's magistrate here!" The old woman replied again, her fear immense.

This young man was terrifying. She had once accompanied her master to see Wang Pengtian and thought he was a godlike figure. But compared to this frail youth, even Wang Pengtian seemed inferior.

Luo Tian learned the magistrate's destination and didn't hesitate, lifting his spear and walking out of the gate. He left behind several corpses and some elderly and children.

Luo Tian didn't notice a woman's arms cradling a ten-year-old child, his fists tightly clenched. His clear eyes were filled with hatred.

Outside the gate, seeing Ning Yu'er looking at him unfamiliarly, Luo Tian smiled: "Do you think I'm cruel?"

"Yes," Ning Yu'er nodded honestly. The Luo Tian she had just seen was terrifying, unlike the one in her heart.

"Alas... Do you know that if it were normal, none of them would survive? This is the rule in the cultivation world—eliminate threats. Think, if I didn't kill them today, and I left, then you and your mother would be targeted. Who do you think they'd take their anger out on?" Luo Tian's eyes held no mercy.

He wanted to teach Ning Yu'er this lesson, for she was too kind—too kind to let her know the cruelty of Tianyuan Continent. But Luo Tian knew that with Ning Yu'er's character, without him by her side, she would suffer. So he took this opportunity to teach her a lesson in survival of the fittest.

Ning Yu'er listened, understanding vaguely. She thought Luo Tian's words made sense. If he hadn't killed them today, they would never let her and her mother go.

But she still felt pity for the corpses in the courtyard, not wanting to look at them any longer. She spoke softly to Luo Tian: "Elder Brother, I understand. Let's go!"

"We still need to visit Tianyuan City and find the magistrate. Someone who raises such a son and relatives must not be good. I'll deal with them all!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly toward the direction of Tianyuan City.

Luo Tian was actually anxious, unsure how long he had delayed. The Washing Spirit Pool's opening was crucial for him, but leaving Ning Yu'er behind made him uneasy.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Ning Yu'er nodded gently. She knew that once they entered Tianyuan City, Luo Tian would have no major problems, as he was closely connected with the Gu family.

"Let it carry you. It'll be faster!"

Luo Tian lightly patted Baihu's back, a gentle smile on his face.

Baihu let out a low growl, expressing dissatisfaction. To have a beast of bone-fragmenting level one carry an ordinary person felt like losing face.

"I'm afraid!" Ning Yu'er's face showed fear, though she knew Baihu meant her no harm.

Luo Tian sighed in frustration, his face showing a bitter expression as he looked at Baihu's mocking gaze. "It'll be there soon. Just sit on it!"

"I'm afraid!"
"Sit, it's fine! Look, I'm sitting here too!"
"I really am afraid!"
"Then I'll carry you!" After a brief exchange, Ning Yu'er seemed determined. Finally, Luo Tian decided to carry her himself—this was faster than letting her walk.

Ning Yu'er's face blushed as she lay on Luo Tian's back, the wind flashing past her. She felt an overwhelming warmth, forgetting time as she pressed her pretty face against Luo Tian's back.

Luo Tian had no distractions, focused on finishing this matter quickly and returning to his sect to enter the Washing Spirit Pool and see if he could advance to bone-fragmenting level.

"Arrived!" Luo Tian's voice woke Ning Yu'er.

"What? So fast!" Ning Yu'er blushed as she got off Luo Tian's back, her face full of disbelief. Normally, it took her two or three hours to sell vegetables in Tianyuan City. Yet this time, she arrived in just a moment.

Luo Tian stood before the Wang family's gate. Since Gu Family had been moved to Five Elements Sect, the Wang family was now the dominant force in Tianyuan City. The courtyard's size had expanded significantly compared to before.

At that moment, a group of people outside the Wang family's gate were talking. Seeing Luo Tian carrying Ning Yu'er at the gate, they showed surprise.

When one of the middle-aged men saw Ning Yu'er, his face darkened: "Ning Yu'er! Who is he?"

Ning Yu'er turned, her face changing. She stammered: "The magistrate!"

"I asked who he is! Why didn't you accept Shui Jie's marriage proposal? It seems you have a lover!" The middle-aged man strode forward, his face unkind as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 255: I've Come to Kill!

"How? Yuanji, do you know them?" Another high-ranking middle-aged man heard the voice and hurried over.

"Yes, a girl from our town. My son likes her!" Shui Yuanji's face showed anger as he looked at Ning Yu'er and Luo Tian, acting like a husband catching his wife cheating.

"Ah, these matters are your own to handle. No need for me," the other middle-aged man spoke softly.

"Such a small matter, why trouble you? I'll handle it and then visit you!" Shui Yuanji respectfully addressed the middle-aged man.

"Ah, I'll go in first!" The middle-aged man walked away with his hands behind his back.

"You, break your own legs and promise never to bother Ning Yu'er again. Today's incident is over. You saw where we are—this is the Wang family's gate. The person who entered just now was the son of the Wang family's chief steward! You offended me, which means you've offended the Wang family!" Shui Yuanji looked at the middle-aged man walking away and immediately changed his demeanor, addressing Luo Tian.

"Ah, that person—did you let him go? Come back!" Luo Tian ignored Shui Yuanji's shouting and called out to the middle-aged man.

"Hmm?" The middle-aged man, who had just turned around and taken a few steps, furrowed his brows. He glanced coldly at Luo Tian.

But upon realizing there was nothing unusual about him, he didn't leave and instead sneered: "Yuanji, finish this quickly. I'll cover for you!"

"Ah, good!" With the middle-aged man's words, Shui Yuanji felt at ease. His face flashed with a sinister expression.

"Has the Wang family become so arrogant and domineering?" Luo Tian lightly polished his Cracking Heaven Spear, his eyes filled with killing intent.

"Arrogant or not—what difference does it make? Your fate is the same today!" Shui Yuanji, seeing Luo Tian didn't move, his face darkened as he rushed toward him. His body-refining level three power surged, and he punched Luo Tian.

"Idiot!" Luo Tian's eyes showed mockery. A mere body-refining level three couldn't even break his defense.

Luo Tian extended his hand, grasping Shui Yuanji's fist filled with blue spiritual energy. His eyes showed contempt.

"You!" Shui Yuanji's face changed in shock. He thought this frail youth was just like Ning Yu'er, an ordinary person. How could he withstand his punch?

But he hadn't expected that his punch was effortlessly caught by this youth, and no spiritual energy fluctuations were seen on the youth's body.

Ning Yu'er watched from the side. When she saw Shui Yuanji's fist about to strike Luo Tian, her face was filled with fear. Her small hands covered her mouth, unable to speak, as if she had seen Luo Tian being knocked away.

But what shocked Ning Yu'er again was that this punch, which she thought would knock Luo Tian down, was effortlessly caught.

The middle-aged man on the steps saw Luo Tian easily catch Shui Yuanji's fist, his eyes narrowed. But he didn't take it too seriously.

"Who are you?" Shui Yuanji tried to pull his fist back but found himself unable to move. Cold sweat flowed down his face.

"Who am I? I've come to reunite you with your son!" Luo Tian released Shui Yuanji's hand, and the Cracking Heaven Spear pierced through his throat.

"Spit..." Shui Yuanji's face showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian. He hadn't expected that even after stating he was from the Wang family, this person would dare to kill openly at the Wang family's gate. This was an enormous provocation against the Wang family.

But after a brief thought, Shui Yuanji lost consciousness and hung on Luo Tian's Cracking Heaven Spear.

"You!" The middle-aged man who had been watching the scene from the steps was furious upon seeing Luo Tian actually kill someone in front of him.

"Ah, I heard he's your relative," Luo Tian tossed Shui Yuanji's corpse away, a playful look on his face as he addressed the middle-aged man.

"Young man, although Shui Yuanji is a fool, he's not someone you can kill at will. And daring to kill in front of me today—no matter who you are, you'll stay here!" The middle-aged man's body surged with spiritual energy from his body-refining level five.

Seeing the middle-aged man's aura, Luo Tian nodded inwardly. It seemed after the Gu family left, the Wang family's strength had increased significantly.

"Answer my question: did you order him to commit evil deeds in the town?" Luo Tian ignored the middle-aged man's aura and asked again.

"What if it is? What difference does it make?" The middle-aged man didn't rush to attack immediately. His instinct told him this youth was no ordinary person.

The two guards at the gate saw the middle-aged man preparing to act, their faces tense. They had remained indifferent toward Shui Yuanji's death, but this middle-aged man was different—he was the son of the chief steward. If anything happened to him, they would face severe consequences for their inaction.

"If yes, kill you! If no, run..." Luo Tian suddenly changed his tone, his voice like thunder that pushed the middle-aged man back.

"Step by step..." The middle-aged man was pushed back several steps by Luo Tian's formidable aura, his face showing great fear.

Luo Tian didn't want to waste words with the middle-aged man, so he moved swiftly. His body was like a leopard, crashing into the middle-aged man's chest.

"Crack..." A clear sound of bones breaking echoed, and the middle-aged man's body flew like a kite into the gate.

"Wang Pengtian! Come out and meet me!" Luo Tian ignored the injured middle-aged man, shouting into the courtyard. His powerful spiritual energy surrounded his voice, echoing like thunder over the Wang family's premises.

Wang Pengtian had been in a good mood recently. With the Gu family's departure, he now clearly became the city's ruler, with more resources and quickly advanced to body-refining level seven.

At the moment Luo Tian's voice rang out, Wang Pengtian's face suddenly changed. His body-refining level seven power surged as he rushed toward the gate.

At the same time, all members of the Wang family hurried to the front of the gate, eager to see who dared provoke the Wang family.

Luo Tian planted his Cracking Heaven Spear in the ground, his gaze calm as he watched the Wang family members emerging from the gate.

At that moment, the two guards at the gate were still stunned, their legs trembling and unable to speak.

Wang Pengtian arrived at the gate, his face showing a serious expression as he saw the injured middle-aged man. Upon recognizing Luo Tian, his eyes paused, then he smiled: "Luo Brother, why didn't you say you were coming? I would have come out to greet you!"

Seeing Wang Pengtian emerge, Luo Tian let out a cold laugh: "I feared you wouldn't welcome me. Because I've come to kill!"

Chapter 256: Wang Pengtian's Fury

"Ah..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, Wang Pengtian inhaled sharply. Since their last meeting, he had defined Luo Tian as someone not to be provoked. Not only was it the Five Elements Sect behind him, but Luo Tian himself could annihilate the Wang family.

Following this principle, Wang Pengtian had maintained a good relationship with the Gu family, especially after his son Wang Tianxiang returned from Dahan Forest, further solidifying Wang Pengtian's belief.
