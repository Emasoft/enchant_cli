"Good!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, raising his hand and sending a nine-colored flame into the air. It hovered before Meng Wushuang.

Meng Wushuang's hands moved swiftly, and the nine-colored flame split into nine separate flames.

Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, gray, and black—nine colors, nine flames encircling Meng Wushuang's body.

"Come!" Meng Wushuang roared, and the nine-colored flames transformed into nine seals, imprinting themselves upon his body.

"Buzz..." Meng Wushuang's aura surged, and his wounds began to heal rapidly. In an instant, he was restored to full health.

"Kill..." Meng Wushuang took a step forward, charging directly at Meng Hongchen. Meanwhile, Lu Chong advanced toward Bai Ye. Shui Changkong's every clash with Bai Ye caused his body to tremble violently, clearly exhausted.

Shui Changkong was replaced without pause, rushing toward Jie Qian to take over from Xiang Tianming. Though Shui Changkong was only an Immortal King at the middle stage, he could still handle an Immortal King at the early stage.

"Finally safe for now," Luo Tian sighed, beginning to fight against Jie Se. Time passed slowly; the Immortal King at the early stage surrounded by Yaochen and Long Jie finally collapsed under their assault.

At this point, the Tiancan Sect's forces had only Meng Hongchen remaining. The Immortal King battle now took place in four locations.

"Victory is near!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a hint of joy as Yaochen and Long Jie flew toward his position.

"Buzz..." Just as everyone felt victory was within reach, a series of thunderous roars echoed from the heavens. A vast green gate radiated immense power, descending upon Luo Tian's suppression.

Chapter 2410: Disturbance

"Eternal Life Gate!" Luo Tian's face paled as he recognized the gate from Yousheng Mountain.

"Useless scum, I must take matters into my own hands!" A cold voice echoed as a figure burst skyward before Luo Tian's eyes.

"Nie Yuntian!" Luo Tian murmured, his hands forming seals as he unleashed the Infernal Ghost Claws toward the green gate.

"Boom..." The heavy impact echoed through the sky, striking Luo Tian with its force.

"Luo Tian, did you expect this?" Nie Yuntian gazed at Luo Tian's disheveled form, his eyes filled with madness.

"You alone cannot change the situation. To capture me is pure folly!" Luo Tian stood atop the sky, Yaochen and Long Jie now at his side. Though they were injured, Jie Se and Nie Yuntian could not subdue them.

"Have you ever known despair?" Yet it was not Nie Yuntian who answered, but a voice laced with amusement.

Two more figures leapt into the sky, their presence sending Luo Tian's expression darkening.

"Fu Tianhan, Fu Tiankui!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth; he hadn't expected these three to hide within the Tiancan Sect this long.

With their arrival, his fate was sealed—Fu Tianhan was an Immortal King at the middle stage, while Fu Tiankui and Nie Yuntian were both early-stage Immortal Kings with strength surpassing ordinary ones.

"What do we do?" Luo Tian's forehead broke out in cold sweat; they were no match for Fu Tianhan and the others at their peak.

"Boy, come with me," Fu Tianhan chuckled, relishing control as he gazed down at Luo Tian.

"Today no one can save you!" Nie Yuntian coldly spoke, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian with absolute confidence.

"Looks like we must fight to the death! You all leave; their target is me. If they capture me, you'll never succeed!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Long Jie's battered form.

"Boy, we still have a chance. Just hold on for a while; when I recover, I'll shield you!" Shui Changkong transmitted his thoughts to Luo Tian.

"Senior Brother, let's fight them!" Long Jie roared, and Yaochen tightly gripped his staff, eyes burning with battle spirit toward Fu Tianhan.

Luo Tian remained silent; he knew Long Jie and Yaochen would never let him face this alone.

"If you want to kill me, then all of you shall die with me!" Luo Tian roared, charging toward Fu Tianhan.

"Who do you think you are to challenge me?" Fu Tianhan laughed, allowing Luo Tian's charge. His right fist was wrapped in a layer of ice-like armor, striking toward the approaching Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The collision of fists produced a crackling sound, and Luo Tian's body was thrown back. Fu Tianhan's face showed surprise as he took a few steps back.

"Strong body!" Fu Tianhan nodded, begrudgingly praising Luo Tian's formidable physique.

"If you were at your peak, I might have been cautious," Fu Tianhan laughed, and his other hand radiated intense heat. He extended a palm strike toward Luo Tian.

"Raging Wind!" Luo Tian, not daring to be careless, roared and unleashed the Raging Wind technique—his maximum effort of seven times his physical strength.

Another explosion, Luo Tian was thrown back again, coughing blood as cracks spread across his arms.

Meanwhile, Long Jie and Yaochen clashed with Nie Yuntian and Fu Tiankui. In an instant, they were also at a disadvantage.

"No match," Luo Tian wiped his lips, gazing at Fu Tianhan; no one on the battlefield could match Fu Tianhan's strength. Everyone was too exhausted.

"Boy, take another strike..." Fu Tianhan laughed, continuously striking with palm and fist, pushing Luo Tian back with each blow. Blood spurted from Luo Tian's mouth as his body looked on the verge of shattering.

"Buzz..." Just as Luo Tian and his companions were about to collapse, Shui Changkong could no longer watch. He leapt into the air, thrusting his trident toward Fu Tianhan.

With Shui Changkong's aid, Luo Tian was no longer so heavily pressured, but he still coughed blood under Fu Tianhan's blows.

"Water Sect, it's time to give you a lesson!" Fu Tianhan laughed, his hands wielding both ice and fire as he struck.

The thunderous explosions continued; the Immortal King battlefield briefly balanced, but Luo Tian's group was still at a significant disadvantage.

On the other side, the Tiancan Sect had completely collapsed. The Tianyuan Sect's people watched the battle above with exhaustion.

"Is this fate trying to destroy our Tianyuan Sect?" The sect's disciples and elders looked with despair.

They had become so powerful, even defeating the Tiancan Valley, but waves of enemies never gave them hope.

"What should we do?" Nan Gong Yuqing and others stood at the front, gazing at Luo Tian's battle. They were also injured and could do nothing to help Luo Tian.

"Wan Lingkong, set up several formations to kill them all!" Diao Dezhu commanded, gazing at the bloodied Wan Lingkong.

"Senior Brother, in my current state, setting up formations to fight Immortal Kings would take at least half an hour. By then, Luo Tian and the others would be dead," Wan Lingkong sighed, his face twitching with every word.

"Buzz..." Just as everyone was at a loss, three streaks of light flew toward the battlefield.

"What's so special about this emergence?" As they wondered, an old voice echoed.

Before the words finished, three figures appeared in their sight.

"Sorry for the disturbance!"

"Goodbye!" Seeing the battle above, the three didn't hesitate and turned to leave.

"That fat man... he seems familiar," The three sped away, but Diao Dezhu and others glimpsed their appearance.

"Sun Kernen!" The next moment, they gasped in realization, shouting his name—unexpectedly encountering Sun Kernen here.

"Run! They must have recognized us!" Hearing Nan Gong Yuqing's shouts, the three didn't stop but sped up.

"Dammit, so many people, we'll definitely be killed!" They flew for several million miles before realizing no one was chasing them, exhaling a long breath.

"Sun Kernen, that bastard!"

"That son of a bitch ran so fast, faster than me!" Seeing the three vanish, Nan Gong Yuqing and others cursed. They knew Sun Kernen's cowardice had become a habit from being chased.

"Wait... I think I saw someone familiar, that person about to be killed—wasn't it Luo Tian?" Sun Kernen furrowed his brows, recalling the battle.

"Let's sneak back to check? If it really is Luo Tian, we'd be ungrateful if we just left!" Sima Tuo grinned.

"Let's check, there's still the old man," Sun Kernen thought for a moment before biting his lip and looking at the thin old man beside him, finding some confidence.

"Rubbish! Rudeness, I hate fighting and killing. If you have time, find more big tombs instead!" Hearing Sun Kernen's words, the old man scolded.

"Come on, Luo Tian saved my life; I have so few friends!" Sun Kernen bit his lip and exchanged a glance with Sima Tuo. They ignored the old man's complaints and flew back toward the battlefield.

"You two bastards..." The old man watched Sun Kernen and Sima Tuo fly away, ignoring him completely, cursing again.

"Three... two... one..." Sun Kernen and Sima Tuo whispered, counting down.

"You two little bastards, you didn't even ask your master for help!" Before they finished speaking, the old man rushed to their side and slapped them both on the back of their heads.

"Ask? You wish! I won't let you!" Sun Kernen and Sima Tuo's mouths twitched, recalling the last time they asked for help. The old man had become even more aloof with every request.

From then on, they never asked the old man again; he always helped them without being asked.

The three sped quickly back to the battlefield, leaving people stunned as they watched the fat and thin trio.

"It's really Luo Tian!" Sun Kernen gasped, seeing Luo Tian struck by Fu Tianhan's palm and thrown back, his body covered in ice shards.

"Old man, go kill that person!" Sun Kernen roared, his voice filled with anger.

But Sun Kernen and Sima Tuo quickly retreated, appearing before Nan Gong Yuqing's group.

"Ugh..." The old man was stunned, standing there without any high-level presence—looked like a very猥琐 old man.

"Fighting and killing isn't my job!" The old man's mouth twitched, gazing at Fu Tianhan and immediately recognizing the clothing of the Eastern Emperor Sect.

"Zhang Chenglong, damn it, hurry up and fight!" But before the old man finished speaking, Meng Wushuang, who was battling Meng Hongchen, shouted.

"Meng Wushuang, it's you!" Hearing Meng Wushuang's words, the old man rubbed his eyes and saw Meng Wushuang.

"You dare touch my brother!" Zhang Chenglong roared, charging toward Meng Hongchen without even acknowledging the blood-spitting Luo Tian.

"Damn..."

"Old man, we asked you to help Luo Tian, not the fire master!" Sun Kernen shouted as Zhang Chenglong rushed toward Meng Wushuang.

"I need to hold on a bit longer..." Luo Tian's mouth twitched, his body shaking as the ice shards on him shattered.

Chapter 2411: Great Gathering

A golden spade appeared in Zhang Chenglong's hand, slicing downward toward Meng Hongchen.

"Get out..." Meng Hongchen roared, his hands swirling with crimson mist that burst into a red skull, flying toward Zhang Chenglong.

Thunderous sound echoed; the seemingly powerful skull was instantly shattered by the spade.

"Die..." Meng Wushuang roared, his fire-red hand forming an eight-directional fire sea, slapping Meng Hongchen's body.

Though Meng Hongchen was strong, he had fought many battles and wasn't in better condition than the fire master. With a thunderous explosion, he was struck by the fire master's palm and spat blood, his back collapsing.

"Almost over! Meng Hongchen is almost done!" Diao Dezhu's group looked with joy, clearly feeling Meng Hongchen's weakened aura.

"But what about Luo Tian?"

"Long Jie and Yaochen are also struggling!" Nan Gong Yuqing's group looked with anxiety, watching the other battlefields, all in peril.

"Crack..." Luo Tian's chest caved in, his body flying back again, as if about to fall apart. Fu Tianhan's overwhelming power allowed him to fight two opponents; another palm struck Shui Changkong and sent him flying.

"Old man, this is what you forced me to do!" Luo Tian's eyes turned red; Long Jie and Yaochen were even more pitiful.

"Come out!" Luo Tian could no longer contain himself, activating the Book of Epochs in his mind.

"Xiao Jie, Hou Ge, both come here; I'll kill them all!" Luo Tian called to Yaochen and Long Jie.

Long Jie and Yaochen appeared beside Luo Tian, swaying unsteadily as if about to fall.

"You want to capture me? Come on!" Luo Tian roared, gazing at Meng Hongchen and Bai Ye, then turned and flew toward the depths of Huan Tianhai.

"Want to run? That's not so easy!" Fu Tianhan's face instantly showed a cold smile, his hands moving as icy air spread across the space, freezing it.

"What is Luo Tian doing?" Everyone was confused, not knowing what Luo Tian's next move was.

Crackling sounds echoed as ice mirrors appeared before Luo Tian, blocking his path.

"Make way..." Luo Tian continuously punched, as if mad, shattering each ice mirror with his fists.

"Can't hold on anymore?" Luo Tian slowed down, a bitter expression on his face; his injuries were severe.

His chest was caved in, one arm broken, and countless wounds across his body, many of them fatal.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed; Luo Tian's heart began to beat, a drop of blood energy was summoned and transformed into power.

"Boom boom..." As the golden drop of blood erupted, Luo Tian immediately felt a warm sensation spreading from his chest outward.

In an instant, Luo Tian's minor wounds healed, and his aura surged.

"World Heart blood still has this effect?" Luo Tian was shocked; he could clearly feel his condition improved by seven-tenths. If not for the severity of his injuries, he could have instantly returned to peak condition. But Luo Tian fled because he didn't want more people to see the Book of Epochs, and secondly, his Demon Body Liberation time was about to end.

But with the drop of blood burned, Luo Tian's condition improved significantly, even pushing back his Demon Body Liberation time.

"Unsurpassed World Heart!"

"Now it's enough!" Luo Tian shouted in his heart, not choosing to return and fight Fu Tianhan again. Even with his current condition, returning would result in the same outcome.

"Huh?" Fu Tianhan's eyes flashed with surprise, watching Luo Tian's speed not slow but actually increase. His brows furrowed slightly and he took a step forward, chasing Luo Tian.

"Let me see you die!" Fu Tiankui and Nie Yuntian also gritted their teeth, flying toward Luo Tian's direction.

A瞬万里, with Luo Tian's speed and his desperate flight, he instantly flew over ten thousand miles. However, Fu Tianhan's group didn't slow down; they followed closely behind Luo Tian, starting a chase.

"Let's go help the elder!" Long Jie and Yaochen looked at Xiang Tianming, rushing toward a monk.

Luo Tian had taken three people; the situation instantly returned to the Tianyuan Sect's advantage. The group began attacking Bai Ye and Meng Hongchen.

...

Luo Tian's face darkened, feeling the three behind him chasing. His body radiated golden light; the aura of the Book of Epochs began to spread around him.

"Almost there..." Luo Tian muttered in his heart, actually looking forward to it. He hadn't used the Book of Epochs for a long time.

Time passed slowly; within less than a stick of incense, even with Luo Tian's spiritual sense, he couldn't feel the battlefield. At the same time, the golden Book of Epochs slowly flew out from Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian was originally a demon cultivator, but now he was wrapped in golden divine light without any discomfort.

"Suppress!" Luo Tian suddenly turned, his cold voice echoing as the golden Book of Epochs flew out, radiating overwhelming gold light like a sun, even brighter than the rising sun in the east.

"What is this?" The three chasing Luo Tian stopped instantly, their eyes turning serious.

"It's a book!" Fu Tiankui shouted, watching the golden book flying toward them. The overwhelming aura pressed down on them, making Fu Tianhan's group look grim; that aura made it impossible to resist.

"Crack..." As the three were shocked, the golden Book of Epochs slowly opened, flipping to the first page.

"Today it's either them or me!" Luo Tian roared, having led the three here to gamble everything.

"Buzz..." The power spread, golden divine light spreading outward.

Huan Tianhai's waters surged, winds reversed, and the Dao roared; the golden divine light instantly struck Fu Tianhan's group.

"What kind of power is this!" Fu Tianhan looked at the Huan Tianhai waters turned into a vacuum by the divine light, his face changing.

"Fight together!" Almost instantly, the three began to resist, merging their barriers to enclose themselves.

"Eternal Life Gate!"

"Ice Cold Nine Heavens..." At the same time, three martial arts techniques were launched toward Luo Tian.

Boom boom... In an instant, the three's techniques collided with the divine light and were instantly destroyed, producing a thunderous explosion that swept up.

"Crack..." After destroying the three techniques, the divine light didn't dissipate but continued to spread, crushing the three's combined domain and striking their bodies.

"Pu..." The three were thrown back, spitting blood; Fu Tiankui and Nie Yuntian's chests looked as if they had been cut in half.

"What is this thing!" Fu Tianhan's group looked terrified, gazing at the still golden glowing Book of Epochs.

"Indeed, the first page isn't enough!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, pouring his demonic energy into the Book of Epochs.

"Buzz..." Absorbing Luo Tian's cultivation, the Book of Epochs emitted more buzzing sounds. Under Fu Tianhan's group's terrified gaze, the second page of the Book of Epochs slowly opened.

The entire sky darkened, as if falling into endless darkness. Cold air spread around. Under Luo Tian's expectant gaze, the world fell into chaos; a black hand凝聚 in the sky.

The hand was very vivid, clearly showing its patterns. At the moment that black hand凝聚, Fu Tianhan's group felt terror, especially Fu Tiankui and Nie Yuntian who almost cried.

As the three were shocked, the black hand descended, pressing down on them with the heavens. Though they were suppressed by that aura, facing life-or-death danger, they had no choice but to fight.

Fu Tiankui waved his hand, a scroll flying out and unfolding instantly. A golden sword burst forth with overwhelming sword intent.

"Human Emperor's sword intent, equivalent to an Immortal King at the late stage!" Fu Tiankui spoke, now in life-or-death crisis, he had to reveal his last secret.

Nie Yuntian also acted, throwing a talisman that launched a golden fist toward the black hand.

Boom...

Three explosions, the world paused; Huan Tianhai's waters surged, and Luo Tian's ears were almost ruptured by the collision sound. He was thrown back, blood spurted from his nose and mouth.

The world turned dark again; after half a moment, Luo Tian recovered, breathing heavily as he looked into the distance.

In his vision, the black smoke dissipated, but only Fu Tianhan remained standing there, eyes filled with terror.

"Soul and spirit energy!" Luo Tian instantly sensed the presence of spiritual force drifting from above.

"Was it good enough?" Luo Tian looked at Fu Tianhan with a playful gaze, bringing Fu Tianhan back to his senses.

"You definitely can't use it for the third time!" Fu Tianhan shouted, the previous strike had truly shaken him. However, he knew that such a powerful attack would cost great energy; thus, he was certain Luo Tian couldn't summon it again.

"Is that so?" But Fu Tianhan's answer was Luo Tian's playful voice; the suspended Book of Epochs emitted more golden light.

Chapter 2412: Shocking

The divine power was overwhelming; the golden Book of Epochs hovered there, emitting more light. Fu Tianhan's heart trembled with fear, cold sweat immediately flowing down his forehead.

"Luo... brother, let's talk it out..." Fu Tianhan felt as if a sharp blade was at his neck. Having endured two attacks from the Book of Epochs, Fu Tianhan was exhausted; if another strike came, he felt certain death.

"Talk your mother, didn't you want to kill me? Today I'll finish you!" Luo Tian's eyes were red; they had repeatedly attacked him, and even if it was anyone else, they would be angry. Especially Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt his cultivation drained; the World Heart's golden blood erupted again, a drop of energy flowing into the Book of Epochs.

"Buzz..." Golden light spread everywhere; the golden Book of Epochs opened again, this time flipping to the third page.

As the third page of the Book of Epochs opened, the world turned dark; winds and clouds surged. The entire world seemed to stop.

Boom boom...

As the sky shifted, a golden light descended and spread out, a golden seal crashing down toward Fu Tianhan.

Fu Tianhan's eyes showed madness; under life-or-death crisis, he waved his hand, a golden bone flying out from his palm.

"Pu..." Blood spurted; Fu Tianhan's body withered, and his red blood splattered onto the golden bone.

In an instant, the golden bone erupted with ten thousand feet of divine light; a vague shadow appeared out of nowhere. The shadow radiated supreme power, extending its hand to strike the descending golden seal.

"Boom..." The golden seal directly shattered that shadow, continuing to press down on Fu Tianhan.

"How is this possible!" Fu Tianhan's eyes showed disbelief, shouting in shock. That bone was a finger bone of the Human Emperor Fu Xi; its power was immense, but Fu Tianhan hadn't expected it to be no match for the seal that came from the golden book.

"Boom..." In an instant, the golden seal pressed onto Fu Tianhan's body; his face still showed terror. Next moment, he turned into blood mist and scattered in the air.

Crack... Huan Tianhai's waters surged, as if split by an invisible wave. Luo Tian even saw the bottom of Huan Tianhai.

Luo Tian stood atop the sky, weak and exhausted; two drops of heart blood had drained him.

The golden Book of Epochs returned to Luo Tian's mind; his body swayed as he fell into Huan Tianhai, but a smile was on his face. No matter what, he had won.

Purple lightning appeared, piercing through the still-undulating waves and catching Luo Tian.

"Haha!" Seeing who had caught him, Luo Tian's smile became even more intense; it was Diao Dezhu.

Diao Dezhu's appearance meant the other side of the battle had ended, and his presence confirmed that Tianyuan Sect had won.

"Let's go! We've won!" Diao Dezhu panted, supporting Luo Tian as they flew back to the battlefield.

Their speed wasn't fast; Diao Dezhu had also expended much energy, and he had used his last strength to catch Luo Tian.

...

On the blood-red sea surface, figures stood there, none of them intact; they supported each other while gazing into the distance.

Three monks were sealed in their cultivation, losing their former arrogance; Bai Ye's face was grim as he watched the Tianyuan Sect people with joy.

After Luo Tian and the three left, Meng Wushuang and Zhang Chenglong surrounded Meng Hongchen. Then they fought with Lu Chong.

Bai Ye was strong, but he couldn't match three Immortal Kings at the middle stage. Within a quarter of an hour, he was defeated and captured.

Bai Ye was from Xumi Mountain; no one knew how to handle him, unlike Meng Hongchen who belonged to the Central Three Heavens.

Shui Changkong, Meng Wushuang, Lu Chong, and Zhang Chenglong stood there, their eyes filled with concern.

Shui Changkong, Xiang Tianming, Long Jie, Yaochen—eight Immortal Kings in total. Such strength could surpass any sect of the Central Three Heavens.

The Tianyuan Sect had lost two million people, leaving two million remaining; they were all injured, and some bore irreversible injuries.

"Unknown how the boy is doing," Meng Wushuang murmured; if it weren't for Luo Tian luring three people away, they might not have won.

Time passed slowly; under the expectant gaze of everyone, two figures flew toward them from afar.

"Roar..." At the moment they appeared, the Tianyuan Sect people roared, their voices filled with reverence.

This battle had truly made Luo Tian a god in the hearts of the Tianyuan Sect people. They would never forget that solitary figure leaving with three powerful opponents.

Nan Gong Yuqing and others flew up, surrounding Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian smiled, speaking to everyone, and gazed at Shui Changkong: "Senior, this favor is too great. In the future, if there's anything, just say it in the Central Three Heavens; our Tianyuan Sect will surely use all its strength!"

"Go back, it's too exhausting," Shui Changkong smiled. Though the Fish People Sect had also suffered heavy losses, if they ever faced trouble, Luo Tian and others would certainly help. This benefit was huge.

After all, the Tianyuan Sect now had six Immortal Kings, including three at the middle stage. Their strength was formidable.

The two groups separated; Luo Tian and others boarded their warships, flying toward the Central Three Heavens.

They traveled for a full day; Luo Tian and others were on the warship, healing their wounds. Yet they remained tense, fearing any further chaos.

On the second day of their journey, several streaks of light pierced through Huan Tianhai. Figures flew toward Luo Tian's warship.

"Another one?" At the moment those figures appeared, Luo Tian and his group instantly opened their eyes. The warship stopped immediately, and Luo Tian's group flew into the sky.

"What's going on?" As they spoke, those figures appeared at the warship, gazing at the still crimson Huan Tianhai and the weakened Luo Tian.

They were strong figures from the Central Three Heavens, naturally including Ye Wudao and Ye Sheng.

"Little Tian!" Ye Wudao flew close to Luo Tian, sensing his weakness and unhealed wounds. He knew something had happened; combined with the fact that they hadn't found Tiancan Valley people at Huan Tian Coast, they could guess many things.

"Zhen Tian had started early; Tiancan Sect ambushed us on the way!" Luo Tian spoke softly, as if it were trivial.

"Wow..." Luo Tian's words seemed casual but made the Central Three Heavens strong figures gasp.

"Tiancan Valley has fallen!" People's eyes showed disbelief, gazing at the still battered Tianyuan Sect people.

Tiancan Valley was the second-ranked sect in the Central Three Heavens; if Tianyuan Sect could defeat it, their power was terrifying.

When people saw the terrifying strength of Tianyuan Sect, they immediately understood why it had defeated Tiancan Valley. Three Immortal Kings at the middle stage and four at the early stage—what could Tiancan Valley use to resist?

"Their wounds aren't healed!" People felt Luo Tian's group's weakness. Some became eager, especially from the Eternal Life Sect.

"Little Tian, since it's successful, let's celebrate!" But Ye Wudao spoke up, dispelling that thought.

"Lu Tian!" The three elders of Shenglong Sect also stepped forward beside Luo Tian, their eyes filled with guilt.

Time had changed; Shenglong Sect was now stable in the Central Three Heavens. Zang Yunfei had advanced further, entering the early stage of Immortal King; the other two elders also reached half-step Immortal Kings.

They had originally planned to help Tianyuan Sect during Zhen Tian, but the battle started early. Tianyuan Sect had entered on its own. Seeing Luo Tian's group in such a battered state, they could imagine how fierce the battle had been.

"The top sect of the Central Three Heavens!" Seeing Tianyuan Sect's shocking strength, even the top-tier Bai Family had to acknowledge that Tianyuan Sect was now the number one sect.

"Zhang Chenglong!" But when people saw Sun Kernen's disciples beside Meng Wushuang, they instantly gritted their teeth.

"Ugh..." Zhang Chenglong smiled awkwardly, saying nothing but gazing at everyone.

Originally, when Xuan Yue World collided with the Immortal World, most sect leaders were sent to Xuan Yue World by several Immortal Kings. Sun Kernen's group had visited many sects, naturally leaving traces.

"Master of Stealing Heaven, truly deserving the name!" Nan Gong Yuqing's group looked with admiration at Zhang Chenglong. After Sun Kernen introduced him, they knew he was the former Master of Stealing Heaven from the Nine Domains and the second Book of Epochs master they had seen in the Immortal World.

"I've never feared anyone!" Zhang Chenglong looked at the other sect leaders' hostile gazes and spoke loudly, his voice filled with authority.

"Using the tiger's skin to cover oneself..." Luo Tian and others were speechless, looking at Zhang Chenglong with a natural expression. They felt that Sun Kernen's group were all the same.

But they didn't stop Zhang Chenglong, as he had helped greatly; without him, Tianyuan Sect would have been destroyed.

Hearing Zhang Chenglong joining Tianyuan Sect, the others' anger couldn't be expressed but only glared at him.

"Congratulations, Luo Tian!" Bai Tian smiled and approached Luo Tian with a friendly gesture.

"Congratulations to Tianyuan Sect; we will send gifts for your founding ceremony!" The head of Ziyang Sect smiled with flattery.

Chapter 2413: Visitors

Ziyang Sect had previously been on bad terms with Luo Tian. Now that Tianyuan Sect was so strong, it could crush them without leaving a trace. They naturally had to show favor.

With Ziyang Sect leading, other sect leaders also showed favor, speaking to Luo Tian.

"I am the sect leader!" Diao Dezhu shouted angrily, causing laughter from the Tianyuan Sect people.

Luo Tian deeply looked at Ziyang Sect's new leader, originally planning to settle the score after arriving in the Central Three Heavens. But now seeing their attitude, he knew they were scared; after several times almost wiping out Ziyang Sect.

Tianyuan Sect's strength was so great, it would surely have many sects willing to flatter them. Let Luo Tian vent his previous anger.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian spoke to everyone, returning to the warship.

Seeing Luo Tian return, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian and Ye Sheng also followed him back to the warship.

"I am the sect leader of Tianyuan Sect, listen up! My name is Diao Dezhu!"
