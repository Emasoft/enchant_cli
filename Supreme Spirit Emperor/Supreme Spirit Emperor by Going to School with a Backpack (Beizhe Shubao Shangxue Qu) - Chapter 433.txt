Luo Tian's fists were constantly worn down as he relentlessly attacked, revealing golden bones in some areas.

“Ninety-five… ninety-six…” Luo Tian roared, his voice laced with madness, yet it only incited Man Zhan's fury.

“Roar!” A furious cry echoed as Man Zhan refused to accept defeat, countering Luo Tian's punch with his back.

“Boom…” Luo Tian's fist struck Man Zhan’s back, spewing blood like water from Man Zhan’s mouth. Yet Luo Tian's face paled instantly.

The massive body was shattered by the impact, Man Zhan’s back caved inward, but he used Luo Tian's punch to break free from his grasp. He appeared ten thousand zhang away, pale-faced and watching Luo Tian.

“Damn it, so close!” Luo Tian's face was ashen, his arms feeling alien. He gazed at Man Zhan, equally pale and distant.

“You truly are strong, so much that I’m surprised—your strength has left me in disarray!” Man Zhan’s previously unformed arm slowly grew, his eyes filled with admiration.

“But this ends here. Three more strikes remain—I’ll grant you no chance!” Man Zhan’s pale face bore confidence as his hands moved swiftly, complex divine laws swirling in his palms, converging into a single force.

“Combat technique?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his hands moving just as fast. He knew Man Zhan's combat techniques were rare but devastating, like the "Bitter Seven Steps."

“The methods of a king are formidable, yet they’re not truly their own. When wielded, they lack the power of a king in his prime!” Man Zhan spoke softly.

“You young prodigies possess extraordinary talent and formidable strength, but you lack our longevity.”

“We’ve lived so long that we’ve mastered the art of creation. We’ve had time to refine and forge our own combat techniques.”

“Like that great sage of your human realm, who created the Epoch Treasures during his battle. I assume those were his own creations.” Man Zhan’s voice was soft, divine laws swirling as a terrifying pressure formed before him.

“Hum…” A humming resonance filled the air as Man Zhan’s palm凝聚 a golden hand, radiating supreme energy and an oppressive aura that shook the stars.

“This is my life’s work—crafting a technique comparable to Bitter Seven Steps, after three million years of thought!”

“I know I can’t match the Man Clan’s divine ancestor, but a true king must forge his own path. Though I couldn’t attain the Dao in my second life, I’ve finally synthesized all these years of ideas into a technique of my own!” Man Zhan’s face glowed with brilliance.

“Though it can’t rival Bitter Seven Steps, it suits me best—thus its power surpasses even my own Bitter Seven Steps!”

“You must endure it!” Man Zhan’s voice thundered across the stars, shaking Luo Tian, Sa Man, and the Divine Spirit.

“Luo Tian, give up! If you accept this, you’ll die!” Sa Man shouted, watching Luo Tian’s golden palace form in his hands.

“Is this the method of that human sage?” Man Zhan’s hands moved, sensing Luo Tian’s technique was familiar. His eyes shifted, his heart trembling slightly.

“Accept it!” Luo Tian’s gaze hardened as he unleashed the "Buddha Heaven Attack" with one hand and inscribed the "Eight Directions Treasure Sealing Art" with the other.

“Good!” Man Zhan nodded, his eyes glowing. His hands shifted again, a golden finger pointing toward Luo Tian.

The ancient Man Clan’s shadow—this battle had left all royal heirs with psychological trauma, including Man Zhan. Though he hadn’t joined the attack on Gu Tian Shu, he would never forget that blood-stained figure, invincible and slaughtering all.

Now, Luo Tian’s use of Gu Tian Shu’s method stirred Man Zhan to shatter his fear, erasing the seed of terror within him. To suppress Gu Tian Shu’s method with his own was the best way.

“Man Heaven Three Strikes—Man Heaven Finger!” Man Zhan decided, his finger emitting an invisible wave. The golden finger radiated suffocating power, instantly rushing toward Luo Tian.

The void trembled as the golden finger carved a path through the stars, black skies retreating like they were yielding.

“Boom…” As Man Heaven Finger launched, Luo Tian’s ancient palace formed in an instant, its misty aura surrounding it like a celestial palace. It pressed toward the golden finger.

In an instant, the two techniques collided—no explosion, but blood flowed from everyone’s ears.

Then, the two supreme attacks dispersed, their power sweeping across the small world.

“Block it!” Luo Tian trembled, raising a golden barrier before him.

As the barrier formed, the annihilating power surged toward it.

“Sizzle…” The golden barrier was sliced apart like paper, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Aaaah!” Luo Tian roared, his qi surging as he had no choice but to resist with his body.

“Plop…” Blood erupted from Luo Tian’s waist, slicing into his body and sending him flying.

On the other side, Man Zhan’s body also flew back, his situation no different from Luo Tian. His old eyes showed panic.

Sa Man and the Divine Spirit’s heads were protected by the Man Clan’s Royal Weapon—the wolf tooth club.

Chapter 1693: Journey to the Star Luo Domain

The divine power surged, sweeping through the stars of the small world. Where it passed, a vacuum formed.

“Hum…” White wolf tooth club below, Sa Man and the Divine Spirit’s faces showed fear as they watched Luo Tian nearly severed in half.

On the other side, Man Zhan bore a fierce wound but his aura still soared. His gaze was heavy as he looked toward Luo Tian.

“Unscathed! Your body is变态 to this extent?” Man Zhan’s eyes narrowed, for the first time truly regarding Luo Tian.

“Boy, cultivation is arduous. You’ve done us a favor—surrender!” Man Zhan’s face bore sorrow as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Please, elder! Continue!” Luo Tian roared, the wound nearly cutting him in half slowly healing.

“Luo Tian, truly give up! To lose your life over this is not worth it. No matter what, I agree to the alliance between the Man Clan and your Four Sacred Star Domain!” Sa Man’s eyes were sorrowful as he shouted.

“Are you sure?” Man Zhan’s face changed upon hearing Luo Tian’s words. If Luo Tian surrendered now, he might accept the alliance. But Man Zhan hadn’t expected such stubbornness.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s wounds slowly healed, his aura gradually calming as he gazed at Man Zhan.

“I’ve decided to form this alliance!” Luo Tian sighed, his struggle wasn’t for anything else—just to increase the slightest chance of safety for the Four Sacred Star Domain.

“Damn it, can’t you just show some humility?” Man Zhan cursed inwardly. His condition wasn’t good either; if they continued, he might suffer heavy injuries and be unable to recover.

But Luo Tian didn’t know Man Zhan’s thoughts—if he did, he’d curse: “F*** it, why were you so resolute earlier? If not for that, I wouldn’t be fighting like this!”

“Then continue,” Man Zhan sneered, divine laws swirling again before him.

“Hum…” The humming resonance echoed as the golden hand reformed, divine light flowing, and overwhelming pressure made Luo Tian’s face shift.

“This surpasses Bitter Seven Steps!” Luo Tian felt the golden hand contained terrifying power, stronger than before.

“Can’t block it! How? I’ll have to cheat!” Luo Tian muttered, sensing that if struck by this golden hand, he’d be dead for sure.

“Boy, since you seek death, I won’t be polite!” Man Zhan’s face was pale, his body’s epoch power constantly drained. His tall figure seemed withered, showing the hand’s might.

“Man Heaven Three Strikes—Man Heaven Palm!” Man Zhan pressed his palm downward, and the golden hand above him finally formed. The massive palm, like a continent, bore complex textures, divine laws intertwining endlessly.

“Hum…” The golden hand pressed the heavens and earth, rushing toward Luo Tian. In its presence, Luo Tian felt like an ant.

“This f***ing hand would kill me if I was drained again!” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched, watching the golden hand that crushed nine heavens and ten earths.

“Though it’s underhanded, you never said I couldn’t use an Epoch Treasure!” Luo Tian sighed, then a green divine light appeared in his hand.

“Rip…” Green lightning tore through the stars, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword activated, radiating supreme power as it struck the golden hand.

“F***!” Upon Luo Tian’s use of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, Man Zhan cursed and retreated instantly.

After launching the sword, Luo Tian also retreated—he didn’t want to be severed in half.

Next moment, the green Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword expanded violently, becoming a贯穿星空 green divine lightning that struck the golden hand.

“Boom…” The explosion echoed again, sweeping every corner of the small world.

The thunderous sound spread through the vast Man God Palace, causing the people of the蛮荒城 to show fear.

“What’s happening in the Man God Palace?” The Man Clan people questioned, gathering around the palace.

“Go back!” But before they arrived, Sa Man’s voice echoed in their ears, making everyone pause.

“Go…,” the Man Clan people felt a power capable of annihilating their entire continent, swiftly calming.

“Hum…” The ruined stars calmed down as Luo Tian and others appeared in the small world’s sky, their eyes filled with admiration. The small world had completely lost its form, leaving only Luo Tian and others standing there.

“Boy, you used a Royal Weapon!” Man Zhan’s face was angry as he watched the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword hovering above Luo Tian. Earlier, Sa Man, the Divine Spirit, and Luo Tian all had epoch treasures to protect them, but he didn’t. If not for his previous lesson, he would’ve suffered more injuries.

Though Man Zhan wasn’t heavily wounded, his wounds worsened, and his aura was weak.

“Elder, we never said you couldn’t use an epoch treasure!” Luo Tian had no choice but to be shameless, smiling at Man Zhan.

“You…” Seeing Luo Tian’s impudent face, Man Zhan’s expression darkened, his teeth clenched. A true king with an epoch treasure was a major threat, especially if Luo Tian, a powerful true king, used it—perhaps he could kill even this second-life great sage.

“Boy, one strike remains. Even with an epoch treasure, you won’t block it!” Man Zhan’s face showed mockery as he sneered. His hands moved again, his gaze heavy.

“Hum…” The golden hand reformed above Man Zhan’s head, still suffocating.

“Man Heaven Three Strikes—Man Heaven Fist!” Man Zhan spoke again, his golden body expanding. His seemingly withered right hand emitted complex Man patterns. At the same time, the golden hand formed by Man Zhan crashed down, surrounded by golden patterns.

“Hum…” The humming resonance echoed. Next moment, Luo Tian’s eyes widened—this golden hand had merged with Man Zhan himself.

Awe, Luo Tian gazed at the towering figure of Man Zhan, his eyes filled with intense awe.

“Footsteps on countless stars, hands grasping the sun and moon!” Luo Tian muttered, watching the giant figure like a mountain, a god ruling over the stars.

“Block it! If you can’t, it’s your fate!” Man Zhan’s face glowed with divine light, as if descending from heaven. He punched toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it…”

“Is he a second-life great sage?” Luo Tian trembled, watching the golden fist. It felt like it didn’t belong to this world, faintly radiating a divine aura.

“Though not as strong as my one strike against the heavens, it’s several times stronger than the previous Man Heaven Palm. Only a second-life great sage or an epoch master reborn could withstand it!” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched, feeling no path to survival.

“F*** it, I’ll fight!” Luo Tian held the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, its twin lightning emitting a continuous hum around him.

“Better to be a commoner for a while than die! Though I’m sorry, Man Clan ancestor, you just emerged and might die again!” Luo Tian sighed softly, then poured epoch power into the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

But just as Luo Tian was about to fight, a humming sound echoed from his dantian, making his face light up with joy.

“Old comrade, you’re finally ready!” Luo Tian smiled, stopping his pouring of power. His dantian felt a rising aura.

In the golden cycle passage, a golden spear hovered, continuously drawing Luo Tian’s dantian’s mysterious cycle power.

Divine laws and patterns appeared on the golden spear, a yearning opportunity radiating from it.

“Master!” A faint mind link entered Luo Tian’s thoughts, making him smile.

“At last, I’ve cultivated a spear soul! Though weak, this crackling spear is now an epoch treasure!” Luo Tian muttered. He looked at the fist that was only a thousand zhang away.

“One won’t do, two won’t either—three!” Luo Tian waved his hand, a black yin fish flew from his hands. At the same time, the golden spear fell into his hand.

The feeling of blood connection spread from the crackling spear, emitting a cold aura from its sharp tip. It seemed to pierce everything.

“Go!” Luo Tian whispered, throwing the crackling spear. At the same time, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and yin fish radiated overwhelming power, rushing toward the golden fist.

Chapter 1694: Rest and Recovery

“You motherf***!” Man Zhan stood at the edge of the small world, his face dark. Even with his age, he cursed.

“Two and a half Royal Weapons! How the f*** do I fight this!” Seeing the two powerful crackling spear and Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, and the yin fish forming a divine demon map, Man Zhan’s mouth twitched.

“This boy brought another Royal Weapon! If I’m not mistaken, he has a palace-like Royal Weapon too. Three in total—this boy would’ve killed even a second-life great sage if he carried them all!” Sa Man and the Divine Spirit also had twitching mouths, standing at the edge of the small world, their faces filled with envy.

Royal Weapons and Epoch Treasures were heavenly items. Ordinary people having one could walk through nine domains. Luo Tian had three and a half, enough to make anyone jealous to the point of vomiting.

“F*** you! Why did you throw me first? I’m f***ed!” The yin fish’s spirit voice echoed in the stars, colliding with the powerful fist.

“Boom…” Next moment, the void collapsed as the divine demon map shattered under the powerful fist. The black yin fish was blasted away.

“Little f***, you’re screwing me!” The yin fish’s voice echoed in the void, then appeared before Luo Tian.

The humming resonance echoed as the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword unleashed ten thousand zhang of lightning, striking the golden fist that had blasted away the yin fish.

On the other side, the golden spear transformed into a golden dragon, roaring toward the golden fist.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed again as the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword collided with the golden fist. The crackling spear also pierced the golden fist.

A piercing sound rang out, and the scene made Luo Tian’s face light up with joy while Man Zhan’s showed a hint of bitterness.

In the view, two supreme treasures with overwhelming power pierced the fist capable of annihilating a true king. They shattered the fist that had made Luo Tian tremble, turning it into divine fragments before breaking apart. A terrifying wind swept through the colorless chaos of the stars.

“Hum…” After piercing the golden fist, the crackling spear didn’t stop but emitted anger, as if seeking revenge for Luo Tian. It flew toward Man Zhan, making his eyes narrow slightly.

“You motherf***! Think I don’t have a Royal Weapon!” Man Zhan roared, then his massive body grabbed the wolf tooth club hovering above Sa Man and the Divine Spirit. It vanished, appearing in his hand.

“Return!” Man Zhan swung the wolf tooth club toward the golden dragon, turning into a blur. It collided with the crackling spear transformed into a golden dragon.

“Crack!” Thunder roared, waves rising from their collision. At the same time, Man Zhan’s massive body took a few steps back.

“Return!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the crackling spear that had been pushed back by Man Zhan. His voice was gentle.

The crackling spear, a weapon that had accompanied his growth, Luo Tian never abandoned it. Even with epoch treasures, he always nurtured the spear. The spear had not disappointed him; after years of nurturing, it had ascended from a pseudo-epoch treasure to an epoch treasure. Though its soul was just formed, it wasn’t as strong as the yin fish’s spirit, but it was an epoch treasure nurtured by Luo Tian himself.

“Difficult!” Luo Tian’s face showed admiration, holding the crackling spear. For years, he had invested much in this weapon, spending resources to succeed. Others would not have dared or possessed such resources.

“Elder, one hundred and one strikes!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Man Zhan with a voice filled with weakness.

“Hmm…” Man Zhan’s face was dark, holding the wolf tooth club as he stepped toward Luo Tian. His eyes were filled with anger.

“Ancestor, surrender this time!” The Divine Spirit’s face showed a hint of joy but also sorrow as he addressed Man Zhan.

Man Zhan panted heavily, clearly uncomfortable. After a while, he sighed deeply—Luo Tian’s strength had exceeded his expectations.

“Fine, I’ll accept the bet. From now on, you are my Man Clan’s ally. My clan won’t oppose the Four Sacred Star Domain. In future battles, I’ll try to protect you!” Man Zhan sighed softly, his voice filled with regret.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian also sighed deeply. Though he had won Man Zhan’s promise, he had paid a heavy price—continuously resisting, nearly severed in half. If anyone else were a true epoch master or royal child, they couldn’t have endured it.

Luo Tian had also cheated by using epoch treasures. If it were a pure strength contest, he knew he still had some gap with this second-life great sage.

“You two are both injured. Discuss matters after your wounds heal!” Sa Man smiled, addressing Luo Tian and Man Zhan. His heart also sighed deeply.

After this battle, Sa Man was certain his choice was correct. Though he had foreseen some things, after this battle, he was more certain that allying with Luo Tian was right.

“Attaining the Dao!” This life had many prodigies, each with the potential to attain the Dao. But Luo Tian shone like a brilliant star, overshadowing many prodigies. Even those with the strongest bloodlines, in Sa Man’s view, were no match for Luo Tian.

Second-life great sages couldn’t attain the Dao—so it was them now. Those of Sa Man’s generation, like Fu Wenbin, had chances but slim ones. Royal children also had constraints. Thus, Luo Tian’s chance to attain the Dao was greater. If he truly attained it, it would be a path for the Man Clan.

“Go!” Man Zhan returned to normal size after their fight, injured severely. He needed rest, but he felt more frustrated—after all, he was a second-life great sage. His first battle had nearly been dominated by a true king.

“Distance!” Man Zhan thought of Gu Tian Shu, who had dominated royal heirs. His heart was annoyed.

“Huff…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, a wave of fatigue spreading over him. He followed Man Zhan and others out of the small world nearly torn apart by their fight, exiting the Man God Palace’s entrance.

“Out!” As they exited, their tall figures caused a commotion, faces filled with curiosity.

But when people saw the battered Luo Tian and Man Zhan, they immediately recalled Man Zhan’s words. They guessed where the terrifying energy had come from.

“What was the result? Did Luo Tian truly defeat the ancestor?” People speculated, gazing at Man Zhan’s battered form.

“Why are you all standing here? Go do what you need to!” Man Zhan’s face darkened upon hearing the people’s whispers, scolding them. He vented his anger on the Man Clan people.

“Why is the ancestor angry? So furious? Did he truly lose to Luo Tian?”

“My god, it’s amazing. How变态 is Luo Tian! The ancestor is a second-life great sage!” Upon hearing Man Zhan’s words, the Man Clan people dispersed but gossiped more.

They were all one-sided, believing Luo Tian had defeated Man Zhan, hence his anger.

“…”

Man Zhan’s face was pale, speechless as the Man Clan people gathered in groups, whispering and leaving.

“Thank you for your mercy, elder!” But as Man Zhan was furious, a weak voice echoed in his ears. Though not loud, every Man Clan strong one heard it clearly.

“It seems Luo Tian lost. I said the ancestor was invincible. How could he lose to Luo Tian again!”

“I always believed the ancestor was invincible. Though he nearly died in that battle, now he’s recovered!” People immediately gossiped again, their eyes filled with admiration for Man Zhan.

Man Zhan felt better at first but his face darkened again when people discussed that past battle.

“Elder, I did my best!” Luo Tian gazed at Man Zhan, his eyes filled with a bitter smile. He hadn’t expected the straightforward Man Clan to be so gossipy, exposing Man Zhan’s past in front of his ancestor.

“Go!” Man Zhan waved his hand, stepping forward. He scanned the people gossiping, then walked to his residence.

“You should rest too. Once your wounds heal, leave!” Sa Man smiled, addressing Luo Tian. Then he had the Divine Spirit lead Luo Tian to the Southern Ridge territory.

A human being walking freely in the Man Clan—Luo Tian was the first, and this was all earned by his strength.

Not long after, the Divine Spirit led Luo Tian, pale-faced, to the Southern Ridge territory. He said: “Our clan’s strength has improved a bit. I assume it was your doing!”

“Southern Ridge belongs to the Man Clan!” Luo Tian smiled, then gazed at the Southern Ridge giants who were overjoyed to see him.

Chapter 1695: Refining Elixirs

“Elder!” Chu Chen’s face was filled with joy as he stepped out from the Southern Ridge crowd, bowing to the Divine Spirit.

“Hm, how is the clan?” Luo Tian smiled and nodded at the Divine Spirit. The Divine Spirit didn’t stay long; Luo Tian’s words that “Southern Ridge belongs to the Man Clan” were enough for him.

“Go, I need rest!” Luo Tian smiled slightly and entered the Southern Ridge territory under the respectful gaze of the Southern Ridge people.

These days, many things had happened in the Man Clan. The Southern Ridge people naturally noticed and knew that Luo Tian had quelled the clan’s turmoil alone, making them respect him more.

Chu Chen walked with Luo Tian into his small courtyard. At that moment, Chu Chen had transformed to normal size, otherwise the courtyard wouldn’t fit him.

“How is the clan?” Luo Tian and Chu Chen sat at a stone table, Luo Tian asked.

“Elder’s elixirs were very effective. Our clan’s strength has improved by a level. Some members, like Er Gouzi, have entered the Half-Epoch realm!” Chu Chen replied. Though the Southern Ridge was still a small force in the蛮荒城, its strength had significantly improved.

“It’s not enough!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Though the Southern Ridge’s strength had risen quickly, he had to consider its future. If a great battle erupted, the Southern Ridge, as a force in the蛮荒城, would inevitably participate. In such a massive battlefield, these people were like cannon fodder.

“Improve strength. Once my wounds heal, I’ll refine more elixirs to boost the clan’s power to that of several families and help you reach the Epoch Peak.”

“Also, if possible, I’ll discuss with the Divine Spirit and Sa Man to have the Southern Ridge people retreat to their origin domain. It’s better not to involve you in future battles!” Luo Tian sighed again, this being the only thing he could do for the Southern Ridge.

“Everything is at your command, elder!” Chu Chen believed Luo Tian’s words without doubt and nodded.

“Alright, once I recover, I’ll start. After arranging the Southern Ridge properly, I’ll leave!” Luo Tian spoke softly and patted Chu Chen’s shoulder.

“Hm.” Chu Chen nodded, his eyes filled with sorrow before he strode out of Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Treat your wounds! A second-life great sage is truly strong!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He had been defeated twice by a second-life great sage, sighing as he stepped into his room and took the healing elixirs.

Time passed slowly. Though Luo Tian was severely wounded, after seven days he finally recovered.

Then, he began refining elixirs. The蛮荒城 constantly experienced elixir storms, shocking its people. The Man Clan knew nothing about alchemy and thought someone was undergoing a storm in the蛮荒城.

Later, people learned that Luo Tian was refining elixirs there, making the Man Clan envious. South Ridge people were also proud—Luo Tian was refining elixirs in their territory, giving them a sense of pride.

“Did you hear? Luo Tian is not only powerful but also an alchemist of high rank in the human realm!”

“That’s right. Look at those terrifying elixir storms these days. I heard the stronger the storm, the more powerful the elixirs!”

“Look at South Ridge people’s strength. A few days ago, Shi Dali was still in the Saint Peak realm. Now he’s reached Half-Epoch and seems to be fully matured, ready to break into Epoch anytime!” The Man Clan people gossiped, all envious.

Eventually, some Man Clan people couldn’t bear it and came to South Ridge, standing outside its territory to meet Luo Tian.

But these days, Luo Tian was immersed in refining elixirs and no one could disturb him. Only Chu Chen visited occasionally to take out many elixirs for South Ridge people to consume.

“After a month, why hasn’t Luo Tian come out? Is he deliberately avoiding us?” The people of the蛮荒城 stood outside South Ridge, faces filled with impatience but still waiting patiently. After all, it was an opportunity to improve their strength they couldn’t miss.

Time passed slowly. Another half-month passed, and Luo Tian finally sighed deeply, having turned almost all the herbs in his storage ring into elixirs. He handed two storage bags to Chu Chen.

“Save them, these are for you. The rest, distribute as you see fit to the clan members!” Luo Tian instructed Chu Chen.

“Hm.” Chu Chen nodded, then smiled and said to Luo Tian: “Elder, these days many people came to South Ridge looking for you. To avoid disturbing your elixir refining, I had them wait outside the territory. Now there are over ten thousand people—do you want to see them?”

“If you don’t want to, I’ll have them leave!” Chu Chen looked at Luo Tian, recounting South Ridge’s situation.

“Hm?” Upon hearing Chu Chen’s words, Luo Tian’s expression showed confusion briefly before a smile appeared.

“Business is coming! My herbs are running low, so I need to replenish!” Luo Tian spoke softly and walked out of the courtyard with Chu Chen, appearing at South Ridge’s gate.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian took a deep breath upon emerging, surprised that his casual elixir refining had caused such a commotion.

Numerous towering giants stood outside South Ridge, and upon seeing Luo Tian, they erupted into noise.

“Luo Master, do you have time to visit our clan?”

“Don’t be silly! I came first—go to my clan!” A thunderous voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making him headache.

“Alright, everyone stop arguing. I understand your intentions. So I won’t waste words.”

“You can send herbs to South Ridge, have them refined into elixirs. I’ll have South Ridge people deliver the elixirs to your clans!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at those towering Man giants who looked like herbs.
