The people of the Tianyuan Continent, who had long feared for Luo Tian's fate, erupted into joy upon seeing him appear in the sky. His presence undeniably signified that Luo Tian had triumphed over the formidable forces of the Mortal Domain, ensuring the Tianyuan Continent's survival.

The cheers resounded across the continent, faces alight with exhilaration as people howled into the heavens, tears of joy streaming down their cheeks. For years, they had believed the Tianyuan Continent would be erased, its people doomed to perish with it. Yet now, after a harrowing struggle, the continent had endured.

"Enough! Finally, peace will return for a while!" Luoxiong and others bore expressions of relief as they gazed at Luo Tian, shrouded in dark mist above.

"Buzz..." As the people celebrated, Nan Gong Yuching and Jiang Sisi arrived with the Tianyuan Sect's forces atop the sky.

"What is this?" The people of the Tianyuan Continent, upon spotting these figures, felt their joy falter. Their gazes turned fearful.

The highest cultivators among them barely reached the half-step Supreme Realm, a world apart from the Tianyuan Sect's might. Seeing these terrifying powerhouses in the sky, they instinctively recoiled, eyes darting to discern their origins. Especially those of Hu Lao Xing and the Star River Four Thieves behind Nan Gong Yuching—each radiating bloodlust, their eyes gleaming with merciless hunger. Each sent shivers down the Tianyuan people's spines.

"Master, what should we do?" An elder with seven sources approached Jiang Sisi, addressing her.

At that moment, Jiang Sisi had no mind for such matters. Her gaze swept the crowd, silently pondering which of them was Luo Tian's parents.

"Those two must be," Jiang Sisi finally fixed her gaze on Luoxiong and Luo Nantian's couple, sensing a resemblance between them and Luo Tian. When her eyes met theirs, the child within her stirred, sending an unfamiliar aura through her heart.

Jiang Sisi's expression softened as she smiled gently at the three.

This smile unsettled Luoxiong and Luo Nantian, who had already been trembling. They mistook Jiang Sisi's intent, fearing these newcomers were like the Mortal Domain forces—invaders.

Luo Tian soared toward Luo Nantian's side, his gaze respectful. Sensing the shift in others' gazes, he spoke: "Do not fear. These are forces I've gathered over the years in the Four Sacred Star Domains—friends!"

"Ah..." Luo Tian's words ignited a bomb-like uproar among the crowd, transforming their awe into deeper reverence.

These skybound figures clearly weren't triflers. That they were Luo Tian's allies revealed his immense power.

Faced with the crowd's admiration, Luo Tian remained indifferent, inwardly sighing. If they knew this force was the top-tier in the Four Sacred Star Domains, their reaction would be unimaginable.

Yet Luo Tian wasn't one for boasting. His gaze swept over Luoxiong and Luo Nantian, then he bowed: "Grandfather, Father, organize these forces. I'll lead a group to the Mortal Domain!"

Luo Tian's words sent another shockwave through the crowd, their faces etched with concern as they protested.

Hearing their objections, Luo Tian's eyes softened. He shook his head gently: "Fear not. I'll only circle the Mortal Domain's outskirts. If danger arises, we'll retreat."

"Alas... go," Luoxiong sighed, knowing his grandson surpassed them all in strength and experience. He must have plans for the Mortal Domain.

"Ah, by the way, that woman with child—watch over her. She... she's someone I met in the Four Sacred Star Domains, an accidental encounter..." Luo Tian stammered, sending a mental message to Luoxiong and Luo Nantian before vanishing from sight.

"Ha! My grandson truly is remarkable!" Luoxiong, initially dazed, soon understood Luo Tian's meaning. He laughed heartily, his gaze settling on Jiang Sisi with approval.

"Hey, Tian's grown strong. Years away, and he's not only gained power but..." Luo Nantian smiled, attempting to continue before Zhang Qiuyue slapped his back, interrupting him. Her gaze carried worry as she looked at Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

"Ugh..." Seeing Zhang Qiuyue's look, Luo Nantian and Luoxiong exchanged glances, their mouths twitching.

"Does this kid really go to the Mortal Domain for investigation? I get the feeling he's avoiding something," Luo Nantian muttered, his voice laced with anger.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, meanwhile, wore puzzled expressions. They exchanged glances with Luoxiong's group, unsure what these future in-laws were thinking.

"Luo Tian, you bastard!" Jiang Sisi's eyes flashed with menace as she watched Luo Tian vanish into the Book of Epochs. She momentarily panicked, standing atop the sky, biting her lip. Glancing at Luo Nantian's couple below, she bowed respectfully before following Luo Tian into the Book of Epochs.

"Phew..." With Jiang Sisi gone, Luoxiong and the others sighed in relief. It was better she left; otherwise, they wouldn't know how to handle these three women.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, sensing the trio's odd behavior, felt an inexplicable unease. Their suspicions deepened as they watched Jiang Sisi disappear.

"Go! Jiang Yimeng, the rest is yours. We'll be back soon!" Nan Gong Yuching shook his head, smiling as he led Hu Lao Xing and the Star River Four Thieves into the Book of Epochs.

With Nan Gong Yuching's departure, the Tianyuan Continent's people felt a weight lift. Though pressure remained, it was far less intense.

Jiang Yimeng sighed at the departing "cowards," gently patting her forehead. She respectfully approached Luoxiong and Luo Nantian's group.

"Respected elder, Luo Tian is my master. Please issue your commands!" Jiang Yimeng bowed, showing no arrogance despite her Supreme Realm status.

"Alas... that brat left a mess. I'll have to clean up!" Luoxiong inwardly cursed, yet his gaze softened toward Jiang Yimeng. He mused whether this girl had some connection to his grandson.

"Enough. From now on, we're family. You've all seen the world—know what to do. Don't treat me like a relic. Let you handle it!" Luoxiong smiled, helping Jiang Yimeng up. The more he looked at her, the more convinced he felt his suspicions were right.

Chapter 855: Sweeping Through the Mortal Domain – Day One

The Mortal Domain, the most enigmatic of the Nine Domains, had long held the title of top domain. Though its true strength remained unknown, since the dark era when nine sages cleansed the Nine Domains, this title was cemented.

As the domain's gray stars loomed overhead, a crimson dragon slithered through a golden door-like object, flowing toward an unknown destination.

The disturbance spread as a young figure stepped through endless blood mist, appearing beneath the Mortal Domain's murky stars. His face bore a wistful expression.

Before he could speak, a young woman with a swollen belly appeared before him, her face like frozen ice. Her cold voice echoed through the dim stars.

"Luo Tian! Are you even a man? You left me behind—what's that?" Jiang Sisi flew toward Luo Tian, grabbing his ear. Her hand twisted, making his ear rotate, drawing a grimace.

"Ah! Let me explain! Ah, Sisi, please let go!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his face pleading. He dared not resist as Jiang Sisi tugged.

"Hmph. You don't want others to know my identity, or are you afraid of meeting those two—Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan?" Jiang Sisi sneered, showing no intention to stop. The thought of Luo Tian abandoning her while pregnant filled her with委屈 (resentment), making her eyes well up.

Acknowledging his mistake, Luo Tian felt guilty. He had only run away, and now he saw Jiang Sisi's pain. He embraced her: "It was my fault. Once we return, I'll formally introduce you to my parents and grandfather. All will be on me!"

"What about Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan?" Jiang Sisi trembled, her gaze questioning.

Jiang Sisi accepted Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan in her heart, knowing she was the later arrival. Yet she feared they might not accept her.

"Don't worry. Qianxue and Qiuchan are as kind as you. They'll accept you. Everything's on me! Be good!" Luo Tian patted her back gently.

"Ah..." Jiang Sisi relented, a satisfied expression on her face. She released his ear and embraced him tenderly.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly, knowing Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan's stubbornness. Though they'd accept Jiang Sisi, acceptance of himself was uncertain—perhaps even a painful one.

The two embraced beneath the gray stars, forgetting their perilous location. When Nan Gong Yuching arrived, they were all stunned.

"Too bold! No wonder he's the leader—daring to romance in this unknown Mortal Domain!" Ren Hongzhe, known for his loud mouth, spoke loudly, his voice piercing Luo Tian and Jiang Sisi's ears.

Li Tianzhi and Tu Hongfei's mouths twitched. They sighed inwardly, wondering if their leader was bold or confident.

Hearing Ren Hongzhe's words, Jiang Sisi swiftly separated from Luo Tian. Her face flushed red, and with her new mother's aura, she left Luo Tian speechless.

She glared at Luo Tian, suppressing her shyness. Jiang Sisi regained her icy demeanor, standing behind him.

Luo Tian chuckled at Jiang Sisi's sight. The Jiang Sisi before him was vastly different from the one he'd met—once ruthless, now a gentle wife. Where was that cold-hearted woman?

"Ahem..." Luo Tian awkwardly coughed, raising his hand. A battered figure covered in blood appeared before them.

Meng Di, the first day's commander of the Mortal Domain, Meng Guangxiu's son. He had previously invaded the Tianyuan Continent. Now his face was pale, bones shattered, a pile of flesh on the void.

"Perhaps this kid knows something about the Mortal Domain," Luo Tian gazed at the stars, his eyes settling on nine massive planets.

"This... the Mortal Domain..." Meng Di's hazy eyes flickered with clarity, gazing into the distance.

"Yes, I've come to bring you home," Luo Tian smiled, placing his hand on Meng Di's head.

"Mind-Search..." Luo Tian's hands moved without consent, searching Meng Di's soul. Scenes of his memories flooded Luo Tian's mind.

Yet, something puzzled Luo Tian—certain memories were sealed. He tried several times but failed.

"Ah, the Mortal Domain's people truly have restrictions on their memories!" Luo Tian mused before tossing Meng Di aside.

Luo Tian felt that glimpsing those sealed memories would reveal much about the Mortal Domain.

"Enough knowledge for now!" Luo Tian muttered, crushing Meng Di. His gaze darkened as he stared at the nearest massive planet.

From Meng Di's memories, Luo Tian knew this was the first major land of the Mortal Domain—Meng Guangxiu's former territory.

"Go..." Luo Tian led Nan Gong Yuching and others, his face fierce as they flew toward the first major land.

They moved swiftly. The massive planet wasn't far, and along the way, no Mortal Domain people were seen—leaving Luo Tian bewildered.

Half a day later, they arrived at the massive planet.

"Kill!" Luo Tian didn't waste words. Knowing he couldn't linger, his vast spiritual sense enveloped the entire land without detecting any Supreme-level masters. His face contorted with ferocity, issuing orders to those behind.

"Kill..." Hearing Luo Tian's command, Nan Gong Yuching led Li Tianzhi and others, transforming into monstrous beasts as they charged the land.

Luo Tian stood beneath the stars, guarding them. After all, this was the famed Mortal Domain. He couldn't be careless—unknown how the nine major lands were connected. If ambushed, it would be a disaster. He didn't expect to clear the entire Mortal Domain with just these few.

Luo Tian's purpose here was revenge and weakening the Mortal Domain.

Cries of battle echoed. Since Meng Guangxiu's elite had died, the Mortal Domain people on this land were like chicks before Nan Gong Yuching's forces. Worse, they attacked suddenly.

The first major land became a slaughterhouse. Blood flowed rivers, and the bloody scent drifted to Luo Tian and Jiang Sisi's noses.

"This..." Jiang Sisi looked reluctant, watching the Mortal Domain people die before Nan Gong Yuching's hands.

"Don't pity them. Do you know how the Tianyuan Continent fared? These Mortal Domain people have blood on their hands. They're not worth sympathy!" Luo Tian's eyes darkened, his voice cold.

"Who are you to attack our Mortal Domain? You're seeking death!"

"When our Lord returns, we'll tear you apart!" The Mortal Domain people shouted, their cries echoing as they watched their comrades die.

Blood enveloped the first major land, making Luo Tian frown. Not because of how many died, but because he noticed the blood mist drifting into the land itself. A sense of alarm stirred in his mind.

"Stop..." That alarm grew stronger, forcing Luo Tian to alert them.

"Broken Spirit Cliff—this feeling is too similar to that at Broken Spirit Cliff!" Luo Tian pondered, finally recognizing the sensation.

"Could there be a terrifying entity beneath this first major land of the Mortal Domain?" Luo Tian's eyes widened with fear, speaking again.

"Everyone stop. Hurry and retreat!" A loud voice echoed in their ears, startling them.

Nan Gong Yuching frowned. As a half-step Supreme master, he felt the land's peculiarity. He moved to Luo Tian's side.

"Kid, who are you? Daring to intrude on our Mortal Domain?" A playful voice echoed from the void.

Chapter 856: Unrelenting Resolve

Under the Mortal Domain's gray stars, Luo Tian stood atop the sky, his face filled with fear. Nan Gong Yuching and others, drenched in blood, stood behind him, waiting for the group to regroup before leaving this land that made Luo Tian increasingly wary.

"Retreat..." Luo Tian panicked, addressing the group. He felt a terrifying entity stirring beneath the first major land.

"Could it be one of those nine sages? Master said they wouldn't intervene. Why is there such a powerful fluctuation!" Luo Tian was terrified. If his recklessness awakened those old men, his sin would be immense.

"Kid, who are you to dare intrude on our Mortal Domain?" A playful voice echoed. Terror surged from the distance, instantly overwhelming Luo Tian's group.

"Supreme Master!" Luo Tian frowned. A middle-aged man descended from the void, a smile on his face—yet beneath it lay endless coldness.

Behind the middle-aged man, a group of fierce Mortal Domain forces gazed at Luo Tian's group with icy eyes.

"You've slaughtered the first major land of the Mortal Domain?" The middle-aged man approached Luo Tian's group, his face showing surprise at the blood-soaked land. His gaze shifted to Luo Tian's group.

"Did you come from the Tianyuan Continent?" The middle-aged man spoke solemnly, his eyes flashing cold light. He had already guessed but asked aloud.

"Master of the Sixth Major Land of the Mortal Domain, Zhu Dezhi!" Upon searching Meng Di's memories, information about Zhu Dezhi flooded Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian assessed Zhu Dezhi's strength, matching Meng Guangxiu. He could handle it but didn't want to waste words. He nodded, his black sword in hand: "Nan Gong, take Sisi and everyone out. I'll hold the rear!"

"This..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, Nan Gong Yuching hesitated. He glanced at the opposing forces. If they delayed further, more Mortal Domain reinforcements would arrive, making escape impossible—especially with the terrifying entity beneath the land.

"Go..." Nan Gong Yuching bit his lip, addressing his subordinates.

"I'm not leaving!" Jiang Sisi stood resolute before Luo Tian, her demeanor changed. She was no longer the timid wife but returned to her bold self—Tianyuan Sect's Supreme Master.

Luo Tian, exhausted from previous battles, wasn't at his peak. These people were no worse than Meng Guangxiu and the previous Mortal Domain elites. Jiang Sisi doubted Luo Tian's ability to withstand.

"Relax. You don't know your man? These Mortal Domain trash can't stop me!" Luo Tian reassured, then struck Jiang Sisi's shoulder with a palm. His hand shimmered, sealing her cultivation and sending her to Nan Gong Yuching's side.

"Careless!" Luo Tian inwardly cursed. He hadn't expected the entity beneath the land to be so terrifying, nor had he underestimated the Mortal Domain's reinforcement speed.

"Go!" Luo Tian addressed the group. Black demonic energy surged again, his gaze facing millions of Mortal Domain elites and the Supreme Master. No fear in his eyes.

"Be careful... don't forget your promise!" Nan Gong Yuching nodded, transforming into a crimson aura. He led the group toward the blood dragon—Tianyuan Continent's entrance.

"Want to escape? Kill them all. Even if you're a Sage Master, daring to enter our Mortal Domain, I'll make you pay!" Zhu Dezhi's face showed cruelty as he addressed his forces.

"Roar..." A low roar echoed behind Zhu Dezhi. Grey figures chased after Nan Gong Yuching's group.

But in an instant, a dark blade flashed before them. Black demonic energy surged skyward. A slender figure blocked their path.

"Want to pass? First, defeat me!" Luo Tian wielded his demonic sword, embodying a demon king. Alone against millions of Supreme Masters, no fear in his eyes.

"Only a mere Supreme Master dares to provoke me among my millions of Mortal Domain elites?" Zhu Dezhi's face curled with mockery, his cold voice echoing beneath the gray stars.

"Kill..." A low roar echoed. Mortal Domain Supreme Masters, faces filled with killing intent, roared and unleashed their primal power. A massive dragon of energy surged toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes were grave. He glanced at the retreating Nan Gong Yuching group, his gaze fierce.

"Half a day. I need to hold them for half a day! Even if it costs my life, I'll block!" Luo Tian roared. His black blade凝聚 (concentrated), seven demonic blades appearing, slicing toward the primal dragon.

Three dark blades stood out against the gray stars. They collided with the Mortal Domain Supreme Masters' techniques.

"Boom..." Thunderous explosions echoed, terrifying fluctuations spreading. Lightning surged between the collisions, striking the first major land beneath them.

Luo Tian was stunned—the collision's fluctuations didn't harm the land, only creating minor cracks.

"Ah! No wonder Meng Guangxiu fell to you. You have skill!" Zhu Dezhi's face showed surprise. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to easily neutralize the combined attack of millions of Supreme Masters.

Zhu Dezhi, master of a major land in the Mortal Domain, was naturally formidable. His strength matched Meng Guangxiu's. When he first saw Luo Tian, he had looked down on him—Luo Tian's prolonged battles and time in the demonic realm left him weak, not worth Zhu Dezhi's attention.

Now, seeing Luo Tian's three blades, Zhu Dezhi realized he was no ordinary opponent. His playful gaze turned serious.

Nan Gong Yuching's group, flying forward, heard the thunderous sound behind them. Their bodies trembled, then clenched their fists, growing stronger as they flew toward the exit.

Jiang Sisi had already regained her composure. Nan Gong Yuching dragged her forward with primal power.

Her gaze carried longing, especially seeing Luo Tian's frail figure standing before millions of Supreme Masters. Her heart was in her throat.

But Jiang Sisi realized she couldn't stay—she'd be a burden. If she left, Luo Tian's strength would let him escape easily.

Yet an inexplicable unease stirred in her heart. Tears flowed from her eyes involuntarily.

Nan Gong Yuching's group, flying forward, encountered the second wave of attacks from the Mortal Domain. The might was overwhelming, thunderous and earth-shaking. A massive Supreme Master's hand formed, swirling with grey mist, as if it could crush the heavens.

Luo Tian's heart jolted. This attack combined Zhu Dezhi's Supreme Master power, its strength multiplied several times over. It sealed all his escape routes—no way out even if he wanted to flee!

"Fourth Blade..." Luo Tian's face showed fierce determination. He felt his body's state, raised his demonic sword high, and slashed downward with the fourth of seven demonic blades.

The thunderous explosion echoed. Luo Tian's fourth blade finally blocked the terrifying attack.

But he wasn't as composed as before. Terrifying fluctuations enveloped his body, making him feel as if hit by something. His strong physique retreated step by step, blood trickling from his mouth and falling into the stars.

Seeing Luo Tian only injured, Zhu Dezhi finally showed emotion. Facing so many combined attacks, Luo Tian had only sustained minor injuries—this strength surpassed him.

"Regrettable. A prodigy, yet perishing here..." Zhu Dezhi's face showed sorrow. His Supreme Master power was about to gather again, more powerful than before.

"Can still strike two more blades—fifth!" Luo Tian's hands trembled as he held his black demonic sword. He calculated his body's state, how long he could endure and the group's escape speed.

"No holding back!" Luo Tian's eyes showed fierce determination. He waved his hand, a red drum materialized before him, improving his complexion.

"This sacred artifact should buy some time!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, waiting for the attack.

"Sacred artifact!" Seeing the tenfang xuanyu drum before him, Zhu Dezhi's breath quickened. His gaze held intense greed as he looked at the fiery red drum.

As a Supreme Master, he knew this drum wasn't ordinary—it was a sacred artifact.

Sacred artifacts were irresistible to any strong cultivator. Zhu Dezhi had one himself, but it was borrowed from the Nine Sages of the Mortal Domain.

"Kid, you truly are full of treasures. Since you're so kind, I'll take this sacred artifact!" Zhu Dezhi laughed heartily, his expression one of assured victory.

Chapter 857: The Three Supreme Masters of the Mortal Domain

In the endless gray stars, terrifying fluctuations spread through space, eventually converging into a monstrous current. It became a wild storm, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

A red sacred artifact drum stood before Luo Tian. Its fiery red surface faced the storm, as if it could suppress all things in the world.

"Kid, I didn't expect you to have a sacred artifact. Truly surprising! Since you're so kind, I'll take it!" The Supreme Master of the Sixth Major Land in the Mortal Domain, Zhu Dezhi, showed insatiable greed as he looked at the tenfang xuanyu drum. He laughed.

"Then see if you have the ability!" Luo Tian's face was cold, his black demonic energy subtly circulating. His sword raised high, a blade of darkness slicing through the sky, as if to split the endless void.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed. Black lightning struck the drum's surface, runes swirling into a terrifying black dragon that surged toward the storm.

This attack was Luo Tian's strongest. Meng Guangxiu had been injured by it, taken away by the sacred artifact Star River Bell. Now Luo Tian used it again—enough to shock Zhu Dezhi.

Under Zhu Dezhi's terrified gaze, the black dragon collided with the storm of millions of Mortal Domain forces and Zhu Dezhi's full power.

In an instant, the Mortal Domain's attack was torn apart by the black dragon. It only blocked for a moment before rushing toward the Mortal Domain's forces.

"Block it!" Zhu Dezhi's face changed. Fear, long absent, returned to his face.

The Mortal Domain's Supreme Masters were even worse. A million people stood stunned, only recalling to defend when Zhu Dezhi roared.

All Mortal Domain people bore fear. Facing death, they unleashed their primal power, forming tens of thousands of barriers to protect themselves.

A gray banner appeared in Zhu Dezhi's hand. Facing such a terrifying attack, the middle-aged man had to use his full strength.

"Damn it. This kid is a monster!" Zhu Dezhi roared, his gray banner swirling rapidly. A windstorm swept toward the black dragon.

At the same time, the gray banner emitted runes. Its surface expanded, covering a million people under its vastness.

"Roar..." A low roar echoed. The black dragon, sensing Luo Tian's danger, roared. The storm from the gray banner only delayed it briefly before being scattered into a breeze that brushed Luo Tian's body.

"Boom... boom..." Like firecrackers, barriers shattered one by one. After the black dragon's impact, they vanished instantly.

"Ten thousand... a hundred thousand..." The black dragon surged through countless barriers, striking the gray banner.

The thunderous sound echoed again. Terrifying fluctuations made the first major land beneath them crack, yet it didn't break.

Faced with a sacred artifact, the black dragon was hindered. It became endless black mist, enveloping everyone.

"Boom... boom..." However, under the gray banner, blood mist erupted. A Supreme Master was blown apart.

Zhu Dezhi's heart trembled, his face pale. A thin line of blood trickled from his mouth. His eyes held disbelief.

"Truly a monster! Even in this situation, he wounded me. And so many Supreme Masters died from this attack!" Zhu Dezhi inwardly feared.

Under Zhu Dezhi's terrified gaze, the gray banner floated gently. The windstorm again swept, dispersing the black demonic energy and revealing the Mortal Domain's figures.

A bloody scent rushed into Luo Tian's nose, finally easing his furrowed brows.

In view, the Mortal Domain had drastically reduced by ten thousand people. The remaining were all wounded.

"Give you another round—I'll see how you stop me from escaping!" Luo Tian's face showed confidence. His black demonic sword raised again, calculating time for escape.

"This..." Seeing Luo Tian's aura gradually gathering, black mist seeping from his body, Zhu Dezhi showed fear.

Not just Zhu Dezhi. All Mortal Domain people bore terror. Luo Tian's previous attack had left them wounded. If another came, they weren't sure if it would be themselves who died.

"Master, what to do?" A nine-source Supreme Master trembled, not expecting a mere kid to be so troublesome.

"I don't know! Block it! If we can't, we must!" Zhu Dezhi shouted. His gray banner surged with his Supreme power.

But as the Mortal Domain people prepared for Luo Tian's next attack, the sword Luo Tian had gradually gathered was lowered. His eyes showed seriousness as he gazed at Zhu Dezhi's back.

"Ha! Old Six didn't fall to this kid either. No wonder Old Seven was injured by him!"
