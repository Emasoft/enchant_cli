“The Heavenly Net Poison is terrifying!” That night’s harrowing cries filled the Luo family with fear of the Heavenly Net Poison.

The next day, the sky gradually darkened again, and the harrowing cries vanished, allowing the Luo family to breathe a sigh of relief. Those cries had been too terrifying.

“Finally done!” Luo Tian, drenched in sweat, drove the last silver needle, and a powerful suction instantly expanded.

That night, Luo Tian had suffered immensely; even his willpower nearly faltered, and his voice was hoarse from screaming.

“Hum……” A terrifying suction emanated from Luo Tian’s 108 major acupoints, surpassing the previous by several times.

The heavens darkened; a black ghostly vortex appeared above Luo Tian’s courtyard, expanding rapidly and instantly enveloping the entire Luo family in darkness.

“What’s happening!” The Luo family members grew anxious, staring at the massive vortex above the sky with expressions of shock.

“Chen’er!” Luo Shui spoke again, having barely rested that night; each cry had felt like a hammer striking his heart.

“Nothing’s wrong!” Luo Tian replied, his voice now much louder, causing Luo Shui to relax.

At that moment, a group of over a hundred people arrived at the Luo family’s gates, also witnessing the vast ghostly vortex above.

“It must be someone breaking through!” Yan Shu murmured, sensing the thick ghostly qi—enough to propel him into the middle stage of True Immortality.

“Let’s go. Who breaks through doesn’t matter; after humiliating him, we need to return home for dinner!” Zhang Tiantian’s eyes gleamed with excitement as he arrived at the Luo family gates.

Chapter 2103: Accepting the Ghost Meridians

A terrifying black vortex spun above the Luo family, causing their people to tremble. Luo Meng opened his eyes and appeared outside Luo Tian’s courtyard, with Chen Dao following closely, his face filled with confusion.

In the City Lord’s Mansion, the Beast Ghost King’s expression slightly furrowed as he observed the Luo family through the void.

“It must be those people causing trouble for Luo Chen; after all, Luo Chen has become a soft target now. Anyone can press him!” Wang Lie’s face curled with disdain.

Yesterday, those people had also approached Wang Lie, but he refused outright. Such actions were beyond his nature; as the son of the Beast Ghost King, targeting Luo Tian when he was unharmed would be taking advantage of his misfortune.

Though the Beast Ghost King also had a desire to take advantage of others’ weaknesses, Wang Lie knew the Beast Ghost King aimed to intimidate the Luo family. Ultimately, he would still assist Luo Tian in subduing the poison.

“Not right…” The Beast Ghost King furrowed his brows, his formidable spiritual sense spreading out. He saw Zhang Tiantian and Chen Tianzhou standing at the Luo family gates.

As for Luo Tian’s courtyard, obscured by Luo Shui’s spiritual sense, the Beast Ghost King could not discern the situation inside the hall, only seeing it enveloped in thick ghostly qi.

Not only did the Beast Ghost King observe the Luo family, but two other spiritual senses also watched them—those of the Yan and Chen families’ semi-Immortal ancestors.

“Announce: Yan Shu of the Yan family, Chen Tianzhou of the Chen family, and numerous prodigies from the Wheel Rotation Sect have arrived to pay respects to Luo Chen, celebrating his entry into the Wheel Rotation Sect!” Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou smiled.

“This…”
The two disciples guarding the Luo family gates realized something was wrong upon seeing so many prodigies arrive. They quickly rushed into the inner courtyard.

“Do you think he’s in such a pitiful state? Would he dare face us?” Zhang Tiantian’s eyes gleamed with excitement; he longed to see Luo Tian’s pitiful state, which would bring him relief.

“He probably won’t come out. If he does, we can challenge him to a sparring match—how would he respond?” Yan Shu licked his lips.

“Rascal!” As people waited for news of the Luo family’s response, a furious voice echoed in their ears. A figure appeared before them.

“Senior Lin…” The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Sect turned pale, surprised to see Lin Dong.

“Who sent you? Get back and don’t embarrass yourselves!” Lin Dong knew the purpose of these people. He barked angrily.

“Senior Lin, I…” Zhang Tiantian began to respond but was cut off as a large hand struck his face.

“He was originally my disciple of the Wheel Rotation Sect. Now he’s already so pitiful; do you still want to humiliate him? Don’t you think the Wheel Rotation Sect has suffered enough?” Lin Dong coldly spoke.

“Get back! Did you hear me? We’re leaving for the Wheel Rotation Sect now!” Lin Dong roared, then flew toward the city gate of the Beast Ghost King’s domain.

The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Sect exchanged glances but sighed, then flew after Lin Dong.

“Everyone, I’ll take my leave now. I hope you continue!” Zhang Tiantian’s eyes burned with resentment as he addressed Yan Shu and others.

“Don’t worry, Zhang Senior. Now he’s just a paper tiger; one touch and it’ll shatter!” Chen Tianzhou and others spoke, believing they were sufficient without the Wheel Rotation Sect.

“What a disgrace!”
“Would they dare come if my son hadn’t been poisoned?”愤怒的 voice echoed within Luo Tian’s courtyard as Luo Shui listened to the report.

“I’ll kill them!” Chen Dao’s eyes flashed with killing intent, stepping toward the courtyard.

Chen Dao had long carried guilt; he didn’t care about killing a few Beast Ghost King city residents.

“Little Dao, return! Don’t act recklessly!” Luo Shui grabbed Chen Dao, knowing his fury would make him merciless toward anyone except Du Tianming and himself.

“Have the younger generation of our family greet them; tell them I’ll be out in three hours!” As Luo Shui stopped Chen Dao, a weak voice echoed from the room, causing Luo Shui to tremble.

“Good!” Luo Shui nodded, issuing orders to the report bearer.

In the hall, Luo Tian stood there as terrifying ghostly qi continuously flowed into his acupoints.

“Roar…” The roar of the Dragon and Elephant echoed within Luo Tian’s body, a terrifying power circulating through him. The Dragon and Elephant Sealing Prison was constantly activated.

“Drive them away!” Eight-colored flames surged, cooperating with the Dragon and Elephant Sealing Prison to repel the gray toxins clinging like leeches.

“Hum…” Under the combined force of flames and the Dragon and Elephant Sealing Prison, the toxins spread throughout Luo Tian’s meridians finally loosened, being repelled by the Dragon and Elephant Sealing Prison as if scraped from his meridians.

However, despite the strength of the Dragon and Elephant Sealing Prison and eight-colored flames, the gray toxins were not destroyed but gradually converged.

“Damn it, this still doesn’t work!” Luo Tian’s face paled, sweat pouring down as he realized he had exhausted everything yet still failed.

Yet, what Luo Tian achieved was rare; even the Beast Ghost King could only suppress the toxins within Luo Tian’s body, delaying their outbreak.

“Then I don’t need these meridians!” Luo Tian’s face turned wild; he had no other ideas left, so he resolved to fight desperately.

He reactivated his technique, forcing the toxins out of the meridians—not other meridians but directing them toward the main ones connected to his heart and elixir field.

After half an hour, Luo Tian finally forced the toxins into the eight main meridians. The reason for this was a bolder plan: if successful, his strength would soar.

“Cut them!” Luo Tian roared, and the Dragon-Slaying Sword appeared in his hand. Without hesitation, he slashed his chest.

At the same time, a black figure identical to Luo Tian sat in his elixir field. It slowly opened its eyes, and two gray soul blades appeared in its hands. The figure flew out, holding the gray soul blades, and slashed at the nearest two main meridians.

“Plop…” The first meridian was severed by the figure, a searing pain invading Luo Tian’s body. Yet he felt nothing, his hands emitting powerful suction to restrain the corroded meridian.

Second… Third…

Eight meridians appeared in the air, withering instantly and turning into a wisp of ash scattered on the ground.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness; this was his critical moment. If he failed, from now on, without the eight meridians, Luo Tian would be a cripple!

Luo Tian waved his hand, and eight black dragons appeared in his hands. These were the eight meridians he had drawn from Luo Bai’s body, originally belonging to Luo Chen’s ghostly meridians.

Though time had passed, the eight ghostly meridians still radiated a fierce glow.

“Success or failure—everything depends on fate!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, knowing his time was limited. The figure in his elixir field had already begun to wither.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and the eight black meridians instantly plunged into the wound on his chest.

Powerful spiritual senses began to control the eight meridians, one piercing into the heart and another into the elixir field, replacing Luo Tian’s original eight main meridians.

“Hum…” As the eight ghostly meridians were embedded into Luo Tian’s body, a surge of True Immortal power erupted, rushing into the ghostly meridians.

With the influx of True Immortal power, the figure in Luo Tian’s elixir field gained a touch of divinity, slightly improving Luo Tian’s complexion.

Just as Luo Tian thought he had succeeded, a repelling force suddenly emanated from the eight ghostly meridians, attempting to break free from his heart and elixir field. Luo Tian’s face turned pale.

“Repulsion!” Luo Tian felt bitter; he knew he had failed. He realized his mistake—grafting meridians so forcefully would never work.

“His heart is uneasy!” As Luo Tian felt bitter, the moment he stood outside the hall, Luo Shui’s heart began to beat violently.

“I must go in and check!” Luo Shui didn’t hesitate, finally unable to bear it. He pushed open Luo Tian’s door and saw the pitiful Luo Tian, his heart clenching.

“Essence blood! Bloodline!” Upon seeing Luo Shui, Luo Tian’s eyes slightly brightened, his gaze filled with a glimmer of light.

“I need your essence blood—just one drop of heart’s blood!” Luo Tian rasped, gazing at Luo Shui.

“Good!” Luo Shui didn’t hesitate; for some reason, Luo Tian seemed closer to him now.

“Hum…” Black-red blood flew from Luo Shui’s hand, landing in the grotesque wound on Luo Tian’s chest.

Heart’s blood was instantly controlled by Luo Tian, merging into his heart. A warm sensation spread through Luo Tian’s heart. At the same time, the eight black ghostly meridians calmed down.

“Effective!” Luo Shui’s face was pale, his eyes slightly brightening. However, Luo Tian’s condition remained poor. He gritted his teeth and pointed again, sending the second drop of heart’s blood into Luo Tian’s chest.

This drop flowed along the meridians, entering Luo Tian’s elixir field and stabilizing the ghostly meridians embedded there.

“Hum…” As the ghostly meridians stabilized, a terrifying suction emanated from Luo Tian’s body. The black vortex above the Luo family instantly surged into Luo Tian’s body.

Chapter 2104: The Terror of the Ghost Meridians

The black vortex plunged into Luo Tian’s body, a wave of pleasant sensations making his complexion flush. The grotesque wound on his chest rapidly healed.

The eight black meridians were filled with ghostly qi, yet Luo Tian felt nothing, astonishing him.

“So much ghostly qi—has it all been refined?” Luo Tian muttered internally. After grafting the ghostly meridians, he noticed both his elixir field’s refinement speed and the flow of True Immortal power had increased significantly.

True Immortality was about refining ghostly qi into the elixir field, then converting it into True Immortal power. Luo Tian was already an Extreme Dao True Immortal, his speed far surpassing others. Adding the ghostly meridians made his refinement speed terrifying—four to five times faster than others!

That meant Luo Tian’s cultivation speed was four to five times that of others. Such a terrifying pace would leave anyone in the Immortal Realm or Hell speechless.

“It’s time to enter the middle stage of True Immortality!” Luo Tian smiled, waving his hand. A black ghostly ball appeared in his palm—this was the one compressed by the Dragon and Elephant Sealing Prison.

Luo Tian had once turned this ball into a secret weapon, using two of them to absorb ghostly qi and enter the middle stage of True Immortality.

However, there would be many aftereffects, so Luo Tian had never used it before. But now he did, as his current strength was at the early stage of True Immortality and an Extreme Dao True Immortal.

“This…” Luo Shui’s face was pale as he watched the surging qi around Luo Tian. The ghostly qi in this ball was something he had never seen before.

“Boom…” A single ghostly ball directly plunged into Luo Tian’s forehead, then shattered within his body.

Ghostly qi surged; the Wheel of Rebirth Technique activated, frantically refining the immense ghostly qi and drawing it into the elixir field.

The black figure sitting in Luo Tian’s elixir field accepted everything without hesitation, beginning to devour it hungrily.

“Breakthrough energy!” Luo Meng and Chen Dao’s faces showed surprise as they looked at Luo Tian’s room.

“Is he trying to break through to subdue the Heavenly Net Poison? That’s impossible.” Luo Meng shook his head.

“Naive!” The Beast Ghost King’s face bore disdain as he observed the fluctuations within Luo Tian’s hall.

Time passed slowly; after an hour, Luo Tian stood in the hall, and the terrifying fluctuations gradually subsided. He slowly opened his eyes.

“Middle stage of True Immortality!”

“Indeed, after a great crisis comes great fortune. Without the Heavenly Net Poison, I wouldn’t have been forced into this situation. Grafting the ghostly meridians was a great fortune! If it had failed, I might not have died, but I would’ve become a cripple!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with a smile as he clenched his fists, cracks in the虚空 appearing at his fingertips.

Luo Tian was confident that if he met the same True Immortal late-stage assassin again, he wouldn’t be as helpless. He could even use methods to trap that True Immortal late-stage assassin.

“Chen’er!” Luo Shui’s face was pale, watching Luo Tian standing there. Having absorbed two drops of heart’s blood, he could now sense a connection with Luo Tian.

“Father!” Luo Tian softly spoke, approaching Luo Shui. At this moment, he considered himself Luo Chen—within Hell, Luo Shui was his father, unlike Ye Wudao’s adoptive father. This was a true blood relative he needed to protect with his life. Luo Shui had also felt the first sense of family since entering the Immortal Realm.

“Good that you’re alright!” Luo Shui’s face was pale; the two drops of heart’s blood had greatly harmed him. His previous aftereffects from sacrificing himself hadn’t fully recovered, and now he had lost two more drops of heart’s blood. He didn’t know when he would recover.

But to Luo Shui, the fact that Luo Tian had called him “father” was worth it. From now on, they were truly father and son.

After grafting the ghostly meridians originally belonging to Luo Chen and absorbing two drops of heart’s blood, Luo Tian was, in his eyes, his son.

“I’ll help you rest!” Luo Tian approached Luo Shui, smiling as he supported him out of the room.

As they stepped outside, Luo Meng and Chen Dao’s faces immediately shifted, staring at Luo Tian and Luo Shui. They felt Luo Tian’s aura, their eyes narrowing slightly.

“Who was poisoned?” Chen Dao first showed surprise; the two’s states seemed reversed—Luo Tian was full of vitality, while Luo Shui looked as if he had been poisoned.

“Good?” Luo Meng’s body trembled, his eyes filled with disbelief as he spoke in a stunned voice.

“How is that possible!” At the same time, the Beast Ghost King stood in the hall, his eyes also filled with disbelief.

The two semi-Immortal ancestors of the Yan and Chen families also gasped simultaneously; their spiritual senses, though not as strong as the Beast Ghost King’s, could clearly feel Luo Tian’s aura and that the toxins in his body had completely vanished.

“Good!” Luo Tian softly spoke, sighing deeply in his heart. These two days had been extremely painful for him; he truly didn’t want to go through it again.

“Haha, Heaven blesses the Luo family!” Luo Meng laughed loudly; he had never imagined that Luo Tian would have solved the Heavenly Net Poison himself. In his view, it was impossible.

“Even if I had been poisoned, it would have been difficult; he managed to break through. How is that possible? Could it be…” The Beast Ghost King’s eyes deepened.

“First, the Ghostly Essence Pills; then silently stealing all the ghosts in the city. Now it’s the Heavenly Net Poison!” The Beast Ghost King muttered, unable to connect these events with Luo Tian.

“This mustn’t be a coincidence; it’s someone behind Luo Chen, an immortal surpassing me!” The Beast Ghost King was deeply shocked.

“Lie’er, handle the relationship with Luo Chen carefully; don’t offend him. From today, don’t provoke the Luo family; if you can忍, do so!” The Beast Ghost King quickly spoke, his voice filled with seriousness.

The Beast Ghost King had previously suspected a superpower had arrived in the Beast Ghost King City. Now he was certain it existed. The previous two events had made him suspect, but Luo Tian’s resolution of the Heavenly Net Poison confirmed it. It was definitely connected to the Luo family, especially with this Luo Chen, as he had risen too quickly.

“You’re truly perceptive!” The Beast Ghost King sighed longingly, looking at Wang Long; the old man’s face also bore shock.

“Yes…” The Beast Ghost King’s words shook Wang Lie; he hadn’t expected Luo Chen to have such power.

If three months ago someone had told Wang Lie that the Luo family’s Luo Chen would rise, he would have disbelieved it and even scorned it.

But Wang Lie immediately recalled Luo Chen’s every action, connecting them—indeed, he had risen too quickly. This previously overlooked Luo family’s waste had become someone he needed to flatter.

In terms of strength, Luo Chen had blocked a late-stage True Immortal’s assassination; in terms of background, he had someone who could resolve the Heavenly Net Poison—someone surpassing even the Beast Ghost King.

“Now those family disciples are looking for Luo Tian’s trouble; I’ll go now. Though it’s not snowing, it’s still a gift!” Wang Lie softly spoke, then flew out of the hall toward the Luo family.

At this moment, in the Luo family’s reception hall, dozens of prodigies from the Beast Ghost King City sat there. Besides Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou, others were seeing the Luo family for the first time.

Before this, they wouldn’t have dared to be so brazen, but now with Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou leading the way, and numbers giving them courage, they had grown bold.

Opposite them sat some of the Luo family’s young people, their faces filled with resentment; they glared at the others.

Previously, these people had come to the Luo family and been watched by them. At first, it was manageable.

But as time passed, they began to gossip and mock Luo Tian, their words growing increasingly harsh.

The Luo family’s young people were hot-blooded; they couldn’t bear it. Though Luo Tian had no direct connection with them, he was still the face of the younger generation in the Luo family. Soon, conflict arose.

The result was naturally a defeat for the Luo side; the others were elite disciples from each family, and while the Luo family’s disciples were strong, they couldn’t match these people.

“Is there no one left? When will Luo Chen come out? We’ve waited two hours already; our limbs are stretched!” A young man smiled.

Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou stood there, their gazes filled with provocation.

“Yan Senior, Chen Senior, give me a favor; Luo Chen’s master will be here shortly. Don’t trouble them!” Zhang Menliei smiled, approaching Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou to pour tea for them.

“Smack!” However, the next moment, Yan Shu’s face darkened; he slapped Zhang Menliei across the face, sending him flying.

“You’re what? You dare to demand respect from us? Think you’ve become a dog for Luo Chen and now have the right to speak to me? You’re overestimating yourself!” Yan Shu coldly spoke, gazing at Zhang Menliei.

The Luo family people he dared not kill, but Zhang Menliei he could. Essentially, Zhang Menliei wasn’t a Luo family member yet, and everyone knew he followed Luo Tian.

“Where is my brother?” Chen Tianzhou stood up, taking a step forward and grabbing Zhang Menliei’s neck.

Chen Tianzhou had recently gone out to investigate Chen Tiantian’s whereabouts, discovering some clues pointing toward Zhang Menliei. However, he had been busy with Wheel Rotation Sect matters and hadn’t had time to find Zhang Menliei yet.

“Ugh…” Zhang Menliei was lifted by Chen Tianzhou, his face turning red and speechless.

“Close the door!” Just as Zhang Menliei was lifted, a cold voice echoed through the hall, and waves of energy rose from within. A barrier instantly enveloped the entire hall.

“Woof… Woof…” The sound of dog barks echoed in people’s ears, causing Yan Shu to instinctively tremble.

Chapter 2105: It’s My Turn

A black figure with a fierce aura appeared in the hall, instantly rushing toward Chen Tianzhou and biting his arm.

“Ah…” Pain filled Chen Tianzhou’s arm, causing him to immediately release Zhang Menliei. Zhang Menliei fell to the ground.

“Dead dog!” Yan Shu’s face turned grim, staring at the black fat dog that wouldn’t let go of Chen Tianzhou’s arm. His屁股 was also painfully sore.

“Hum…” A withered wooden stick appeared in Yan Shu’s hand, radiating waves of energy.

“You think your master is about to die? Today I’ll kill you first, this dead dog. I want to see what your master can do!” Yan Shu roared, his stick radiating vitality and expanding into a giant tree’s silhouette. It swung toward the black fat dog.

“Who said he was about to die?” A cold voice echoed again, sending an icy chill through the hall. People instinctively shivered.

“Boom…” The tree silhouette disintegrated, and Luo Tian’s figure appeared before the black dog. A dull sound echoed through the hall as Luo Tian grabbed the withered stick, smiling at Yan Shu’s pale face.

“Luo Chen!”
“Master!”
“Lord!” Exclamations echoed, everyone’s eyes turning to Luo Tian, the young man who had blocked Yan Shu’s attack.

“You…” Yan Shu felt his heart tighten; the sight of Luo Tian gave him an indescribable sense of helplessness. That suppression even reduced his cultivation by forty percent.

“What do you mean ‘you’?” Luo Tian slapped down, a black hand with wind sounds swinging toward Yan Shu’s body.

A crack echoed, and Yan Shu was knocked down by Luo Tian’s slap, spitting blood. His eyes showed disbelief.

“Middle stage of True Immortality!” Yan Shu spoke in a stunned voice, as if seeing a monster.

“Where is the poison in his body?” Others also gasped, their eyes filled with shock. They had come to mock Luo Tian but instead saw him rise to the middle stage of True Immortality. His strength didn’t look like that of someone poisoned.

“Master!” The younger generation of the Luo family showed shock but soon turned to joy; they hadn’t expected another miracle from Luo Tian.

“Haha, our master has arrived! What did you want to do before?” The Luo family disciples suddenly became spirited, their faces bright despite being bruised.

“Master, avenge us!” The Luo family people shouted excitedly; at this moment, Luo Tian had fully established his image as their master.

“Hum…” Spiritual laws flowed; Luo Tian pointed his finger, and a black seal dragon flew from his hand, binding Yan Shu.

“Let me go!” Yan Shu roared, trying to break free from the black seals. However, even though Luo Tian hadn’t officially fought at the early stage of True Immortality, his strength was enough to subdue Yan Shu and beat him like a son. Not to mention now, with Luo Tian’s current strength.

“You want to find your brother? I’ll tell you where he is!” Luo Tian turned, addressing Chen Tianzhou who was struggling against the black dog.

“Hum…” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a disheveled figure appeared in people’s sight. This was none other than Chen Tiansheng, who had been captured by Luo Tian earlier.

During this time, Chen Tiansheng had nearly gone mad; he hadn’t been placed in Luo Tian’s storage ring but instead was kept with three dogs and the black dog. The result was predictable.

Chen Tiansheng felt it was the darkest months of his life; these two dogs were terrifying, constantly tormenting him.

“Want to do what? Don’t let me go back; I’ll make you suffer!” Chen Tiansheng shouted, his voice filled with madness. He had finally met Luo Tian again.

“Hmm?” Before Chen Tiantian’s words ended, he saw the people in the hall. His eyes lit up with intense joy because he recognized eight out of ten, and more importantly, a familiar figure—his own brother, Chen Tianzhou!

“Brother, save me! Catch this kid and make him suffer!” Chen Tiantian roared, but his voice cut off abruptly.

“That dead dog! It even bit my brother!” Chen Tiantian felt disbelief; he had never seen his brother so helpless.

“Tianhe!”
“Is it you who did this?” Chen Tianzhou saw Chen Tiantian and his face turned furious, eyes filled with anger as he looked at Luo Tian approaching step by step.

“I’ll fight you, dead dog! Get out of my way!” Chen Tianzhou roared, summoning his weapon. Black ghostly threads were woven into a black armor covering Chen Tianzhou’s body.

Chen Tianzhou was a prodigy of the early stage of True Immortality; although the black dog was strong, it could only hold him back for a while. During the trial, the black dog had only held off Yan Shu for a short time—just tens of seconds. If it lasted longer, the black dog might have been injured by Yan Shu.

“Woof…” The black dog released its grip and returned to Luo Tian’s side.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed through the hall as Chen Tianzhou transformed into a black figure, charging toward Luo Tian.

This charge was done with all his strength because he knew Luo Tian was strong; just one slap had left Yan Shu unable to function.

“Good body,可惜…” Luo Tian smiled slightly and took a step forward, his body radiating an energy that made everyone tremble. He charged toward Chen Tianzhou.

“Crack…” The hall fell silent; a figure was sent flying, and it was Chen Tianzhou.

Luo Tian stood firm, like a mountain, making people look up to him.

“Boom…” The black figure collided with the hall’s wall, Chen Tianzhou’s ghostly armor shattered. Blood spurted from his nose and mouth, and his eyes were filled with shock.

Chen Tianzhou knew Luo Tian was strong but hadn’t expected him to be this strong—so strong that even his ghostly armor had been shattered.

The entire hall echoed with thunderous sounds, but fortunately, Luo Tian had instructed Chen Dao to activate the family’s protective array outside.

“How is that possible…” Chen Tiantian couldn’t speak, staring at Luo Tian standing there. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be this strong—so strong that even his brother couldn’t match him.

“What did I miss in the past three months?” Chen Tiantian rubbed his eyes, feeling like he had been disconnected.

He had fought Luo Tian before and didn’t believe he could beat his brother, but now everything had turned upside down—not only that, but it had been stomped on.

“Die!” As people marveled at Luo Tian’s strength, a mad voice rose behind him.

Bloodlight flashed; a massive blood-colored tree silhouette shattered the void, with winds howling. It was Yan Shu recovering and attacking again.

“You all still watching? Do you think he’ll let you go? Have you forgotten the trial?” Chen Tianzhou fell from the wall, shouting at the people who were stunned.

“Yes…”
“I don’t believe it; we’re so many and can’t beat him? We should have no fear!” People encouraged each other.

“Boom…” This time, Luo Tian punched out, a vortex appearing before his black fist, shattering the void and striking the blood-colored tree silhouette.

The blood essence flowed; the tree silhouette disintegrated again, and Yan Shu’s body kept retreating. At this moment, Luo Tian was someone he couldn’t defeat.

“Everyone, attack together!” Others roared, gathering martial arts from dozens of hands. The powerful fluctuations made everything in the hall fall over.

Luo Tian moved like lightning, appearing before Yan Shu as those powerful martial arts converged. He grabbed the falling wooden stick with one hand and punched Yan Shu’s head with the other.

Yan Shu felt as if he had been hit by a mountain, and immediately fainted. A large bump appeared on his head.

This punch was a mercy; if he had used the chaotic flurry, Luo Tian was confident this punch would have left Yan Shu half-dead.

“You also come here!” Luo Tian grabbed Chen Tiantian, who appeared before him, flanking him.

“Stop!” Chen Tianzhou shouted, his face slightly changing, but it was too late. A series of terrifying martial arts were thrown at Luo Tian by the others.

“Done…” After throwing the martial arts, people’s faces were grim as they looked at Yan Shu and Chen Tiantian standing before Luo Tian.

Boom… Boom… Boom…

The thunderous sounds kept echoing, and the hall trembled violently. Even the entire Luo family felt the fluctuations, as if an earthquake had occurred, drawing the attention of the Luo family members.

The waves surged, and the hall seemed to fall into chaos; everywhere was black mist, and whirlpools devoured everything in the hall.

This fluctuation wasn’t as strong as during the trial, but it was still beyond ordinary people’s ability to withstand.

After the dust settled, the prodigies from various families felt bitter as they looked at where Luo Tian had stood.

“Done, Yan Shu and Chen Tiantian were killed by us!” Their minds immediately formed this thought.

“Now it’s my turn!” A cold voice echoed, and a figure rushed out of the dust toward them. On the ground were two blackened figures—though lying down, they still had some breath.

Chapter 2106: Wang Lie Arrives

The Luo family rushed over, hearing the continuous thunderous sounds from the hall. Chen Dao stood in the hall, holding a long sword.

“Is this where we received those other family prodigies? Did they start fighting inside?”

“If they really fought with our younger disciples, we must stop it!” The Luo family members were anxious but saw Chen Dao standing there with a forbidding aura. They didn’t speak and simply stood there obediently.

Chen Dao controlled the array to prevent fluctuations from escaping the hall and also observed Luo Tian’s battle, his eyes filled with admiration.

“This kid is truly… powerful!” Even Chen Dao couldn’t help but admire him.

In the hall,
Luo Tian moved like lightning, like a tiger in a sheepfold, constantly punching. Each punch sent another disciple from another family to the ground.

The Luo family’s young people were stunned, watching the disheveled figures on the ground and gazing at Luo Tian with reverence.

“Master is too fierce! Are these people really prodigies? I feel like Master was fighting children!”

“Master’s poison has been resolved, and he’s entered the middle stage of True Immortality. Naturally, these people can’t defeat him!”
