“Cough... cough...” Luo Tian collapsed onto the ground, breathing heavily. He felt this battle had been even more perilous than clashing with several prodigies.

Chapter 1421: Immortal Pill Residue

Luo Tian appeared utterly drained, his palms pale with streaks of golden light flickering between his fingers. Diao Dezhu and the others watched with expressions of exhilaration.

Luo Tian’s and Sun Kemin’s conversation was heard clearly by the three. The thought of Luo Tian pulling something from the ancient coffin stirred their emotions.

It had been a long time since they’d seen Luo Tian so battered, his body riddled with bloodied wounds that would take time to heal.

“Boom!” Sun Kemin also collapsed beside Luo Tian, gasping for breath. His eyes gleamed with excitement.

“How is it?” The group’s gazes turned to Luo Tian’s right hand. His palm was pale and trembling.

“It seems successful,” Luo Tian steadied his breath, a smile playing on his lips as he addressed them.

“Use the Yin-Yang Twin Fish; otherwise, it’s unsafe,” Luo Tian instructed Sun Kemin. He waved his free hand, summoning the Yin Fish.

Sun Kemin did not hesitate either, waving his hand to conjure the Yang Fish. The Yin-Yang Twin Fish slowly converged, radiating boundless divine light that enveloped the group.

“Watch,” Luo Tian gradually loosened his trembling palm, eyes brimming with anticipation.

Diao Dezhu and the others stared intently at Luo Tian’s palm, eager to discover what had cost him so dearly.

“Hum...” A resonant hum filled the air, as if a blazing sun rose within Luo Tian’s hand. In an instant, golden light erupted, shooting toward the ancient coffin with blinding speed—so fast that even Luo Tian struggled to react.

“Crack!” However, the golden light collided with the black-and-white barrier created by the Yin-Yang Twin Fish. A crisp sound echoed as it shattered.

The golden light scattered in all directions, darkening Luo Tian’s face. He had clearly seen the golden pill strike the barrier and explode violently, as if self-destructing.

“Hum...” A wild surge of energy swept over Luo Tian and his companions. At the moment the golden light shattered, an overwhelming vitality enveloped them, instantly restoring their battered bodies. Even Luo Tian’s three Reincarnation Immortal Bodies regenerated swiftly.

“Powerful! What kind of pill is this? Even a high-tier Immortal-grade elixir couldn’t achieve such results!” Wan Lingkong marveled, his voice tinged with awe.

“Still,” Ren Hongzhe said after recovering. His eyes gleamed as he gazed at the scattered golden light, clearly remnants of the shattered pill.

“Quickly collect it!” Diao Dezhu shouted, his voice laced with excitement. He transformed into a streak of violet lightning, darting toward the golden fragments to gather them.

Luo Tian and Sun Kemin recovered slightly slower than the three. When they opened their eyes, they saw Diao Dezhu and the others busily collecting the golden light. They joined them shortly after.

Together, the five of them swiftly gathered all the golden fragments, their faces alight with excitement.

“Immortal Pill! Absolutely an Immortal Pill. Even the shattered residue surpasses a high-tier Immortal-grade elixir by leaps and bounds!” Luo Tian’s eyes sparkled with exhilaration as he gazed at the pill residue in his hand.

Regardless of the outcome, this journey to the Thunder Sea Marsh had been worth it.

“If only there were a whole pill. Though this shattered one holds immense value, it’s clearly far inferior to a complete one. Its potency is greatly diminished!”

“Do I ever have the skill to craft such a powerful elixir?” Luo Tian, who had always been confident in his alchemy, felt a rare pang of discouragement upon witnessing this pill.

“I wonder who the human skin belongs to. Could it truly be an Immortal? Who could kill and flay an Immortal, burying it in this coffin of the dead?” Sun Kemin murmured, his voice trembling as he stared at the black ancient coffin.

“Likely connected to the Thunder Lord,” Luo Tian replied, his tone tinged with admiration. He could think of no one else with such transcendent power.

“Could there truly be Immortals? But why have we heard no tales of them for so long? We know only of the Epoch Lords, yet this world holds Immortals?” The group’s minds were filled with doubt.

“Never mind. Such a world-altering being is beyond our comprehension. Perhaps only the Epoch Lord could glimpse another realm,” Luo Tian murmured, his voice laced with bewilderment.

“These elixir residues can still elevate our cultivation. Let’s refine them,” Luo Tian said, a smile on his face. For now, enhancing their strength was the priority.

Diao Dezhu and the others had no objections. Their eyes gleamed with excitement as they divided the elixir residue and began refining it, even assigning a share to the Soul-Eating Silkworm.

As they sat in meditation, Luo Tian’s gaze returned to the black coffin, his eyes filled with reverence.

Yet, in an instant, Luo Tian’s expression shifted. He noticed something strange: the blood he had spilled on the coffin had vanished, leaving only the dried traces he’d seen before.

“What’s going on?” A bad premonition stirred in Luo Tian’s heart, recalling the vision of himself lying inside the coffin.

But he had no choice. Extracting the pill had been a miracle. He felt he had already awakened something within the coffin, and he dared not open it again.

“Never mind. Let’s focus on strengthening ourselves. I hope this residue allows me to forge another Immortal Body,” Luo Tian muttered, then sat in meditation. His Reincarnation Heaven Technique began to refine the elixir’s immense power.

“Hum...” Golden light rained down, and a thunderous sound echoed within their bodies.

Exhilaration surged through Luo Tian the moment he started refining the elixir. The power was unparalleled in his life.

The hum resonated, and a Reincarnation Immortal Body coalesced within Luo Tian’s refinement. Its formation was swift and seamless.

“Day one... day two...” Time passed slowly, and after seven days, Luo Tian finally completed refining the elixir residue.

The immense power yielded remarkable results. His dantian now held four Reincarnation Immortal Bodies, with the fifth on the verge of forming.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp. “Only a half-formed one remains—Epoch Late-stage!”

“Hum...” A surge of power radiated outward. Diao Dezhu’s face lit up as he rose to his feet.

“Only one step away! I’ll be at Epoch Late-stage!” Diao Dezhu wanted to shout, but seeing the three—Wan Lingkong and Ren Hongzhe—still meditating, he stifled his voice.

“Huh?” Diao Dezhu’s face then showed confusion. He turned to Luo Tian: “Why do I sense three currents of energy in my dantian?”

“What kind of energy?” Hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes also showed confusion. He then rechecked inward.

“This!” His mind was thrown into a storm. He hadn’t noticed it before, but now he saw four Reincarnation Immortal Bodies each radiating a current of energy, emitting waves that sent shivers through him.

“Destroying Heaven and Earth!” He felt the terror of this energy, as if it belonged to another world. If unleashed, its power would be earth-shattering.

“Could this be the legendary Immortal Energy?” Diao Dezhu, sensing three overwhelming forces in his dantian, showed fear.

“My mother! If this thing explodes inside my dantian, will I be done for?” Diao Dezhu trembled.

“I’d be done too. This energy must have come from the elixir, so it should be safe,” Luo Tian admitted, unsure.

“Still, if we could unleash it, it would be a formidable weapon. I feel it could rival the full power of an Epoch Treasure,” Diao Dezhu’s eyes gleamed as he envisioned unleashing it to crush all enemies.

“Exactly. It’s a powerful secret weapon,” Luo Tian replied with a smile.

“Don’t use it unless absolutely necessary. Whoever touches it will die!” Diao Dezhu said, then stood beside Luo Tian, waiting for the three and the Soul-Eating Silkworm to awaken.

Three days passed. Sun Kemin opened his eyes, his cultivation having advanced to Epoch Mid-stage. On the fourth day, Wan Lingkong and Ren Hongzhe, along with the Soul-Eating Silkworm, awoke. Both Wan Lingkong and Ren Hongzhe had reached Epoch Mid-stage, while the Soul-Eating Silkworm showed no change.

Yet none of them had three currents of Immortal Energy within their bodies, only one.

“Let’s go,” Luo Tian said. “We’ll return here only when we reach Epoch Peak. I suspect only the Epoch Lord could fully open this coffin of the dead.”

Luo Tian and the others cast one last reverent glance at the coffin before heading toward the city of ghosts.

“Finally out. The entire Thunder Sea Marsh only has this broken city I can’t enter. But with these fools helping me, it’s no problem. I never thought these fools would actually retrieve something from that coffin!” At the heart of the Thunder Sea Marsh, a man wreathed in lightning smiled slightly, murmuring to himself.

Chapter 1422: Li Tianzhi

Amidst the vast thunder, Luo Tian and his group, along with the Soul-Eating Silkworm, exited the Land of Extreme Yin. Their gazes held reverence and admiration.

“Perhaps something terrifying will emerge here in the future,” Luo Tian murmured, recalling the cold sensation within the coffin. Had he not withdrawn in time, he would have surely encountered something formidable.

“Let’s not dwell on it. This coffin is too transgressing; if it were to emerge, it would cause a stir,” Sun Kemin said softly, his eyes filled with satisfaction. Seeing such an ancient coffin was a first for him.

“Hm,” the group nodded, feeling the return of wild energy around them—opposite to the atmosphere in the ghost city. They exhaled deeply.

The Yin Fish hovered over their heads, and after walking so long, the thunder had begun to harm them. But Luo Tian needed to find out about the women’s whereabouts, so he pressed on.

“Can you sense where your mother is?” Luo Tian asked the Soul-Eating Silkworm, his tone gentle. Though small, its strength was undeniable.

“Don’t know. Can’t sense it at all,” the Soul-Eating Silkworm shook its head, eyes filled with confusion.

“She’s not dead. The soul lamp still burns,” Luo Tian said grimly, continuing toward the depths of the Thunder Sea Marsh with Diao Dezhu.

“Hah! You truly didn’t disappoint me,” a solemn voice echoed in Luo Tian’s group, silencing the wild thunder.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian called out, his voice cold. He thought of the deaths of the Star River Four Bandits.

“Come on, if you want to see me, keep moving forward. You’ll meet me soon,” the low voice said before falling silent.

“Let’s go. I want to see who this so-called divine being is,” Luo Tian strode into the Thunder Sea Marsh, his eyes cold.

“Foolish nonsense. When I meet you, I’ll crush you! I’ve even opened the coffin of the dead—what fear do I have of a coward like you?” Sun Kemin sneered, following Luo Tian.

The thunder grew fiercer. The group walked under the Yin Fish’s protection, their pace slowing as they navigated through the thunder.

After an hour of walking, Luo Tian and his group finally stopped. Their gazes were filled with awe at the sight before them.

Terrifying thunder, like solidified energy, formed a high platform. A figure wreathed in lightning sat upon it, with waves of thunder swirling around their body. Each breath drew massive thunder into their form.

A sense of loneliness radiated from the figure, as if it stood apart from all things. Luo Tian and his group were momentarily dazzled, mistaking the figure for the Thunder Lord and instinctively wanting to kneel.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian called out, addressing the figure that had only given them a back view. His voice was heavy with caution.

“The aura of an Epoch Lord!” Diao Dezhu and the others also eyed the figure cautiously, standing with Luo Tian. They felt an overwhelming aura from it—unique to an Epoch Lord.

The figure appeared towering, radiating immense righteousness as if embodying the essence of heaven and earth. Yet Luo Tian felt a strange familiarity from it, along with an eerie sensation.

“Welcome,” the low voice echoed from the figure, causing Luo Tian’s group to be stunned. Their faces changed rapidly.

“You!” Ren Hongzhe’s eyes turned blood-red, his gaze locked onto the figure that seemed righteous.

“It is I. I spared your life back then,” the low voice said, and Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with intense hatred.

“I’ll kill you!” Ren Hongzhe surged forward, his body trembling as he lunged at the figure. A blade of light appeared in his hand, and he slashed downward, cutting through several thunderbolts before reaching the figure’s front.

“You saw me and still want to kill me?” As the blade neared the figure, it suddenly turned. Ren Hongzhe’s body froze.

“Li Tianzhi!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with disbelief as he stared at the figure that turned. He spoke in a stunned voice.

“Boom!” The blade shattered, and Ren Hongzhe’s face showed disbelief. His body trembled as he stared at the familiar figure before him.

“It is I,” Li Tianzhi said, a faint smile on his face. He waved his hand, and the surrounding thunder erupted violently, forming a lightning sword in his grasp.

“Puff!” The next moment, the lightning sword pierced through Ren Hongzhe’s chest, who stood frozen in shock.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian and the others showed surprise, rushing to catch Ren Hongzhe before he fell.

“Why… why?” Ren Hongzhe’s face was pale as a sheet, blood flowing from his chest. His eyes locked onto Li Tianzhi.

“Why? After all these years as brothers, why would you attack us?” Ren Hongzhe’s eyes burned with madness as he shouted at Li Tianzhi.

“No reason,” Li Tianzhi said, a faint smile on his face. His gaze swept over the group before settling on them with contempt.

“Hand over what you have in your bodies. I might spare your lives,” Li Tianzhi said, his eyes gleaming with greed.

“Son of a bitch!” Ren Hongzhe’s fury reached its peak. He raised his blade to strike Li Tianzhi again, but Luo Tian stopped him.

“Something’s off,” Luo Tian said solemnly. He stared at Li Tianzhi, knowing his character well. This was not the Li Tianzhi he knew.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian asked again, his voice heavy with doubt. Though the figure was clearly Li Tianzhi and even his soul matched, Luo Tian didn’t believe this was the real one. The contrast was too great.

“I am Li Tianzhi,” Li Tianzhi said, a faint smile on his face as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“You have the aura of an elixir!” Li Tianzhi’s eyes lit up with joy. He gazed at Luo Tian and the others, licking his lips with greed.

“Refine you all and extract the elixir’s power. Your task is complete!” Li Tianzhi said, then waved his hands, sending waves of energy from them.

“Rattle...” At the moment Li Tianzhi waved his hands, the scattered thunder became orderly, swirling around him.

“Go…” Li Tianzhi pointed his finger. The thunder surged toward Luo Tian and the others.

“Thousands... millions…” Thunderbolts coalesced, their numbers creating a qualitative shift. The overwhelming pressure made Luo Tian’s group pale.

“Divine King Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian activated his hands, manifesting nine great continents. Combined with two unparalleled techniques, the power was overwhelming as it pressed down on the terrifying thunder.

“Purple Qi from the East!” Diao Dezhu’s body released a vast aura of purple, forming an enormous ghostly fox that charged toward the thunder.

Wan Lingkong and Sun Kemin also unleashed their power, sending waves of wild energy. Their techniques clashed with Luo Tian’s against the thunder.

“Boom... boom... boom…” The thunderous sound echoed endlessly. The terrifying thunder was shattered by Luo Tian’s group, then scattered as electric currents flowed outward.

“Not bad. But you’re still not my match!” Li Tianzhi smiled, rushing toward Luo Tian and throwing a punch.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon!” Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly. He countered with an equally powerful punch.

In a blink, lightning surged between their collision, and after the earth-shattering sound, both Luo Tian and Li Tianzhi retreated.

“Epoch Late-stage,” Luo Tian frowned. His arm bore cracks from the brief contact, but he had sensed Li Tianzhi’s cultivation.

“How did you advance so quickly?” Luo Tian was startled. He hadn’t expected Li Tianzhi to have reached Epoch Late-stage. If it weren’t for the elixir residue he had refined, adding another Reincarnation Immortal Body, he might have suffered a major loss in their clash.

“Good. Strong. Indeed the Luo Tian I remember,” Li Tianzhi took a step forward, charging toward Luo Tian again. But Sun Kemin, Diao Dezhu, and Wan Lingkong attacked simultaneously, while Ren Hongzhe, filled with madness, rushed toward Li Tianzhi.

Faced with four opponents, Li Tianzhi remained calm. He clashed with them one by one, surprising Luo Tian as he managed to suppress all four.

“Thunder Thousands of Strikes!” Li Tianzhi’s face bore a strange smile. He waved his hands, summoning nine thousand and nine hundred thunderbolts that surged into his body.

“Boom...” The sound of explosions echoed, as if empowered. Each punch Li Tianzhi threw carried explosive force, matching Luo Tian’s梵天攻杀大术 (Buddha Heaven Attack Technique).

“This is the Thunder Lord’s offensive technique. How could he have it!” Luo Tian’s face changed, exclaiming in shock. He moved to join the battle against Li Tianzhi because he saw Diao Dezhu and the others struggling.

“Father, this person seems to be corrupted!” During their battle, the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s voice echoed in their ears.

Chapter 1423: Thunder Lord's Obsession

“What?” Hearing the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s words, Luo Tian and his group’s faces shifted slightly. They knew the Soul-Eating Silkworm could see things they couldn’t, just like how they had sensed the powerful presence within the coffin.

“Divine Eye Technique!” Sun Kemin withdrew from the battle, raising five golden seals and imprinting them on Luo Tian’s group’s foreheads.

The golden divine eyes on their brows split open. Their faces changed as they finally saw the truth about Li Tianzhi.

At this moment, although Li Tianzhi was still called Li Tianzhi and his soul was indeed his, it seemed something had merged with his soul. They hadn’t realized until now.

“Thunder Lord’s obsession!” Luo Tian and the others’ faces changed. They recognized what had merged with Li Tianzhi’s soul.

“Of course! The first time I saw him, I felt like facing the Epoch Lord!” Diao Dezhu said softly, his voice filled with disbelief.

“Then was our second brother controlled by this obsession?” Ren Hongzhe gazed at Li Tianzhi, regaining his composure after hearing Luo Tian’s group.

“Does it matter? Now I am him, and he is me. You are friends, yet you still want to kill me? We have become one. If I die, he won’t live either! Ha!” Li Tianzhi laughed, striking Ren Hongzhe back with a punch. Blood flowed from Ren Hongzhe’s mouth.

“Moreover, you think these little fish could kill me? You’re dreaming!” Li Tianzhi radiated an overwhelming aura, making Diao Dezhu and the others feel immense pressure.

“Kill…” There was no other option. Li Tianzhi’s difficulty far exceeded what they had imagined. If they didn’t fight with all their might, they risked falling.

Li Tianzhi was Epoch Late-stage and wielded the Thunder Lord’s techniques. How formidable! Even Luo Tian struggled to withstand him, let alone Diao Dezhu and the others.

Together, they barely matched Li Tianzhi in battle. Neither could overcome the other for a while. But as time passed, Luo Tian noticed something was off.

They had fought nearly an hour, but Li Tianzhi remained overwhelmingly strong. He showed no signs of exhaustion, as if possessing infinite power. Even with injuries, he healed instantly. In short, there was no change.

In contrast, Luo Tian and the others were in a dire state. Even Luo Tian was covered with wounds, though not life-threatening, they slightly affected their combat power. As time passed, the group felt increasingly suppressed by Li Tianzhi.

“Can’t go on like this. If we continue, we’ll die!” Diao Dezhu called out loudly. He knew they had used their full strength, but some hesitation remained due to Li Tianzhi’s identity.

“Kill! Give it your all. Otherwise, you’ll be worn down here in the Thunder Sea Marsh. He can replenish endlessly!” Wan Lingkong said, his voice laced with killing intent.

“Sealing Heaven’s Seal!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He waved his hands, forming a golden vortex in the thunder that gathered heavenly power.

The immense pressure made Li Tianzhi’s face twitch. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have such a powerful technique.

“Sealing Heaven’s Lord!” Li Tianzhi then recognized Luo Tian’s technique. After all, he had once been the Thunder Lord’s obsession. His knowledge and techniques were clearly beyond what Luo Tian’s group could match.

“Wind Thunder Seal!” Li Tianzhi faced the Sealing Heaven’s Seal without fear. He waved his hands, summoning waves of wind and thunder that surged upward. A massive seal formed, colliding with the heavenly power gathered by Luo Tian.

“Boom...” The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Two powerful seals clashed in the terrifying thunder sea.

“Fierce God’s Wrath, Trampling Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian leaped into the air. His massive foot struck downward, aiming to crush Li Tianzhi. Luo Tian had finally unleashed his ultimate killing technique.

“Purple Ghost Blade!” Diao Dezhu spat out a stream of purple qi, forming a long purple blade that slashed toward Li Tianzhi.

Sun Kemin, Wan Lingkong, and Ren Hongzhe also unleashed their full power. Their techniques carried apocalyptic might as they attacked Li Tianzhi.

“Strong!” Li Tianzhi’s eyes flashed with coldness. Facing five of their ultimate techniques, he finally became cautious. He waved his hands.

“Wind Thunder Nine Strikes!” As he moved, Li Tianzhi conjured a lightning sword and slashed downward at Luo Tian’s group.

“Wind Thunder Nine Strikes! The Thunder Lord once used this technique to dominate his peers!” Ren Hongzhe said, clearly knowledgeable about the Thunder Lord.

“Hum...” The lightning sword formed, radiating supreme heavenly power. Under the thunder sea’s加持 (enhancement), it collided with Luo Tian’s group.

The techniques merged and clashed, instantly submerging a vast area of thunder. This created a vacuum around them.

“Wind Thunder Nine Strikes, Second Strike!” Li Tianzhi’s face bore authority. He waved his lightning sword again, striking downward at Luo Tian’s group.

“Fierce God’s Second Trample Shattering Stars... Fierce God’s Third Trample Scaring Gods!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed caution. His massive foot continued to strike, clashing with Li Tianzhi’s lightning sword.

Diao Dezhu and the others retreated to the side, their faces filled with awe as they watched. They couldn’t interfere.

The clash of techniques saw Luo Tian’s massive foot repeatedly colliding with the lightning sword. The explosive force constantly resonated in their minds.

“Truly strong! Luo Tian can match an Epoch Late-stage Li Tianzhi to this extent! He’s connected with the Epoch Lord!” Diao Dezhu and the others marveled, watching Luo Tian’s relentless footfalls.

“Fierce God’s Sixth Trample Shattering the Universe!” Blood spurted from Luo Tian as he clashed with Li Tianzhi repeatedly. He clearly bore serious injuries.

“Kid, you can die! Wind Thunder Nine Strikes! Eighth Strike!” A massive thunderbolt formed into a lightning spear, radiating supreme Epoch power. It struck downward at Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, seeing the overwhelming blade. It was stronger than his sixth trample.

“Using thunder as a furnace, refining the world’s great elixirs!” After delivering the eighth strike, Li Tianzhi didn’t hesitate. He waved his hand, gathering thunder into a furnace that engulfed Luo Tian and the others.

“Boom!” The golden foot collided with the lightning sword. In an instant, the golden foot was severed and struck toward Luo Tian.

“Block it!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. He waved his hand, summoning the Yin Fish above his head. A black barrier descended, blocking the formidable blade.

But Luo Tian still felt a ringing in his head as if struck by something. His mind throbbed.

Before he could react, the thunder furnace enveloped him, unleashing destructive lightning that instantly surged onto the Yin Fish’s spirit. The ultimate refining power made Luo Tian’s face darken.

“Yin-Yang United, Invincible!” Sun Kemin saw Luo Tian in danger and shouted. He hurled the Yang Fish toward Luo Tian, merging it with the Yin Fish.

The power surged. The two Yin-Yang Fishes trembled, emitting ultimate Dao power. A black and white Taijitu formed instantly, colliding with the thunder furnace.

“Two fragments of Epoch Treasures!” Li Tianzhi’s eyes flashed with concern. He watched the powerful thunder furnace shatter under the Yin-Yang Twin Fish, continuing to charge toward him.

“Two fragments of Epoch Treasures. In the presence of a true Epoch Treasure, they are trash!” Li Tianzhi said with a sneer.

“Thunder Wheel!” Li Tianzhi waved his hand. A humming sound echoed, and a golden gear-like object flew from his hands. It spun rapidly, emitting a humming sound. The overwhelming pressure made Luo Tian’s group pale.

“Damn! A true Epoch Treasure! The Thunder Lord’s Thunder Wheel—how did it end up in his hands!” Diao Dezhu and the others shouted, their voices filled with disbelief.

“Ugh…” The Thunder Wheel spun rapidly before exploding outward. It sliced toward the Yin-Yang Twin Fish.

“Help!” Luo Tian and Sun Kemin were speechless. Recently, they had encountered people with Epoch Treasures constantly. It was beyond their capacity.

“Haha… two old comrades, what trouble have you gotten into?” As Luo Tian and Sun Kemin were stunned by Li Tianzhi’s Thunder Wheel, a light laugh echoed in the thunder sea. Their faces changed abruptly.

“Boom...” A black Dao Map, radiating supreme heavenly power, surged toward Luo Tian and the others.

“Divine Demon Dao Map!” Luo Tian’s face darkened instantly. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Haha, old man! I didn’t expect to meet you here. What’s wrong? Come help!” The spirit of the Yin-Yang Twin Fish emerged, its face filled with excitement as it gazed at the approaching Divine Demon Dao Map.

“Divine Demon Dao Map was supposed to guard the Star Moon Clan’s seal. How did it end up here!” Luo Tian felt a storm within him, his gaze fixed on the young man with an amused expression on the Dao Map.

Chapter 1424: The Arrival of All Clans

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian was stunned, staring at the Divine Demon Dao Map and the young man upon it. His eyes were filled with disbelief. He hadn’t expected to meet him here in the Thunder Sea Marsh.

Fu Xingyue, a prince of the Ancient Clan Star Moon, and Luo Tian’s best friend during his time in the Star Moon Clan. Fu Xingyue had helped Luo Tian multiple times.

“Long time no see, Luo Tian!” Fu Xingyue stood on the Divine Demon Dao Map, greeting Luo Tian. He too hadn’t expected to meet him here.

“Need help?” Fu Xingyue asked softly, leaping down from the Divine Demon Dao Map to stand before Luo Tian. His gaze was filled with concern as he looked at the Thunder Wheel approaching them.

“Haha…” The spirit of the Yin-Yang Twin Fish echoed with laughter. The two fish thundered, embedding themselves into the Divine Demon Dao Map. A powerful surge of energy immediately radiated from the complete Divine Demon Dao Map.

“Damn! What’s a mere Thunder Lord’s Epoch Treasure? You said trash before!” The Divine Demon Dao Map echoed three clear sounds. The massive map surged outward, radiating black and white qi that exuded supreme power. It collided with the Thunder Wheel.

The clash of ultimate Epoch Treasures echoed throughout the thunder sea, producing a deafening sound. The endless thunder sea was annihilated in pieces. Invisible waves swept over Luo Tian and the others, sending them flying backward with blood spitting out, their eyes filled with weakness.

On the other side, Li Tianzhi hadn’t expected this turn of events. His face was filled with disbelief as the collision between the Divine Demon Dao Map and the Thunder Wheel caused his body to crack, blood staining it.

As two supreme Epoch Treasures collided, the thunderous sound echoed across nine realms. The nine realms trembled again.

“Another clash of Epoch Treasures!” Everyone was shocked, watching the Thunder Realm. Their eyes trembled.

“Thunder Realm has no sacred lands. How could there be an Epoch Treasure? Looking at the direction, it’s in the Thunder Sea Marsh. Who is clashing there?” People whispered, their gazes sweeping over the Thunder Sea Marsh but not daring to approach, fearing being caught in the crossfire.

Not only did the nine realms erupt in shock, but also on the other side of the Thunder Sea Marsh. The Star Moon Clan’s people, who had been watching the seal break and planned to enter the nine realms, were filled with awe.

“Is this the nine realms? We haven’t even entered yet, and we’ve already heard a clash of royal weapons!” Fu Wenbin’s eyes flashed with light. He stopped the people from entering the nine realms, discussing with two other Epoch Peak masters to delay their entry.

“Star Moon has already entered the nine realms. Let’s wait for him to bring news!” Three elders spoke, calming the restless Star Moon Clan.

The nine realms were where the Ancient Clans had longed to return, seeking redemption for past humiliations. Recently, the thunder power had weakened significantly, causing the seal to break. Fu Xingyue had even subdued the Divine Demon Dao Map guarding the seal. How could this not excite the Star Moon Clan? But this clash of Epoch Treasures had made them delay their entry into the nine realms.

“Damn it!” Li Tianzhi’s face darkened. He watched the Thunder Wheel return to his head, emitting a mournful sound.

Li Tianzhi knew he couldn’t clash with the Divine Demon Dao Map anymore. If they continued, neither would survive.

“Wind Thunder Nine Strikes, Ninth Strike!” Li Tianzhi roared. The lightning sword reformed, and the thunder sea surged again, with massive thunderbolts gathering toward Li Tianzhi.
