When he saw Yao Chen's radiant and mighty aura, Gu Tianxiu's eyes flickered with surprise before vanishing instantly. He then smiled again, his hands moving gracefully. A golden long sword materialized in Gu Tianxiu's grasp through his cultivation, its radiant divine blade emitting a brilliant light that instantly clashed with Yao Chen's long staff.

"Crack..." The red miniature world erupted into a thunderous roar as the two collided, with the Qiankun Zhenshen Pagoda hovering above everyone's heads. A gray barrier spread out, encircling them all.

"Buzz..." In the next moment, Yao Chen's body was sent flying backward, his eyes alight with excitement. His battle spirit reignited once more.

"Master Gu truly is formidable! A sword against a staff was never an advantage, yet Master Gu managed to lift the monkey!" Cao Dedu's face bore admiration as he watched Gu Tianxiu standing with his sword, speaking softly.

"Observe carefully; Master Gu is allowing you to grasp the essence of a准纪元之主. Let us enter the realm of the准纪元之主 sooner!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, realizing immediately after their collision that Yao Chen was no match for Gu Tianxiu.

"What level of cultivation has Master Gu reached? Having lived a second life, he is truly terrifying!" Luo Tian mused internally before closing his eyes and swallowing a pill to recover.

Chapter 1631: Distant Relatives

Within the endless fire realm, thunderous sounds echoed constantly, reverberating through the miniature world as two figures clashed repeatedly.

"Boom..." Yao Chen's body was once again sent flying by Gu Tianxiu, his eyes now filled with respect. This was the first time anyone had regarded Yao Chen thusly.

"Truly strong! Master Gu is indeed remarkable, managing to suppress even Yao Chen!" Cao Dedu and the others looked at Gu Tianxiu with reverence.

"Yet this monkey is truly pitiable; after a month of being beaten, his spirit remains so strong!" Xu Liyi and the others turned their gaze toward Yao Chen, admiration in their eyes. If they had endured a month of being beaten, they would have gone mad long ago.

"Buzz..." As the group marveled, Luo Tian's body emitted a series of humming sounds, his aura gradually rising.

After a month of nourishment from pills, Luo Tian had fully recovered to his peak state. He slowly opened his eyes, a slight smile on his face as he gazed at Yao Chen and Gu Tianxiu standing beneath the stars.

Luo Tian's face bore admiration as he looked at Yao Chen, even he was impressed by the monkey's perseverance. To fight repeatedly despite defeat—had it been him, he would not have managed it.

"What do you think?" Luo Tian turned his gaze toward Cao Dedu and the others who surrounded him, speaking softly.

"It's fine; watching this monkey get beaten brings me a little satisfaction!" Cao Dedu's face carried a hint of schadenfreude as he watched Yao Chen get sent flying again. They had witnessed this scene thousands of times over the past month.

"It truly is satisfying!" Xu Liyi added softly, his eyes also carrying a smile. Though they had seen it thousands of times, it still felt satisfying.

"Idiot! Don't you feel anything? Has the monkey grown stronger in his battle against Master Gu? Previously, Master Gu stood still, but now he can push the monkey back quite a bit!" Luo Tian's face turned red with anger at their words.

"Moreover, in the battle of a准纪元之主, haven't you gained anything?" Luo Tian's gaze fell upon Cao Dedu and Xu Liyi.

"No!" The two shook their heads truthfully, causing Luo Tian's face to darken.

"Never mind; we all have our own paths. Don't be too hasty!" Sun Mengru smiled slightly, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Yes, my progress has also been considerable!" Fu Xingxuan stepped beside Sun Mengru, her eyes soft as she gazed at Luo Tian. Since Luo Tian had awakened, Fu Xingxuan's eyes had never left him. Thinking of all that Luo Tian had done for her, she felt it was worth every moment to follow him.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian felt awkward, unsure how to face Fu Xingxuan now. He had made his decisions alone without consulting Sun Mengru and the others, which left him feeling awkward.

"Hmph..." Seeing Luo Tian's expression, Sun Mengru let out a cold snort. She had seen Fu Xingxuan's actions clearly.

But she was displeased that Luo Tian had attracted another woman, for no woman liked her husband being shared. With three already, she was not about to let a sixth or seventh appear. Thinking this through, she said nothing and watched how Luo Tian would handle it.

Seeing Sun Mengru's gaze, Luo Tian's cold sweat immediately ran down his back. His eyes then turned to the approaching Gu Tianxiu and Yao Chen.

"Master Gu!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, thinking it was a timely arrival. He quickly bowed to Gu Tianxiu with deep respect in his eyes.

"Ah, you've recovered well!" Gu Tianxiu smiled, glancing at Sun Mengru and Fu Xingxuan before giving a slight nod.

"Luo Tian, let's fight again! I didn't get enough of it last time; we must fight thoroughly this time!" Yao Chen looked at Luo Tian, his body battered but his eyes still glowing with golden light.

"Never mind, Monkey Brother; rest for now. Once you recover, come with us to the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Luo Tian shook his head gently, shifting the topic.

"Ah, I must go to the Four Sacred Star Domains; I need to see if that Demon Emperor has any connection with me!" Yao Chen had long wanted to visit the Four Sacred Star Domains, but due to helping Luo Tian, he had postponed it.

Seeing Yao Chen calm down, Cao Dedu and the others sighed in relief. However, they soon felt sympathy for the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains, imagining the chaos Yao Chen would bring upon them. Xu Liyi cast Luo Tian a reproachful glance.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, knowing bringing Yao Chen to the Four Sacred Star Domains was no good.

"Let fate decide!" Luo Tian spoke softly, then turned his gaze to Gu Tianxiu.

"Master Gu, we'll take the Qiankun Zhenshen Pagoda with us. Would you like to come with us to the Four Sacred Star Domains for a couple of days?" He then invited Gu Tianxiu to accompany them, as Gu Tianxiu had not returned to the Gu family for a long time.

"Never mind, I'm old and don't like traveling. When I feel like returning, I'll come back!" Gu Tianxiu shook his head gently.

"Right now, you've become a准纪元之主; your strength is nearly equal to mine. Few in the Nine Realms can match you. I have nothing left to worry about!" Gu Tianxiu gazed at Luo Tian.

"Let's go!" As their words finished, Yao Chen suddenly stood up with a golden aura. He had no real injuries; after calming his internal energy, he was as lively as ever.

"Ah, Master Gu, we'll be leaving first!" Luo Tian and the others bowed to Gu Tianxiu. Even Yao Chen gave a respectful bow before they transformed into streaks of light, bursting out of the fire realm toward the Four Sacred Star Domains.

The Fire Domain was separated from the Four Sacred Star Domains by only a sea of fire, so as soon as they exited the fire realm, they appeared at the edge of the Four Sacred Star Domains. With their speed, they reached the familiar Tianyuan Continent within half a day.

At that moment, the Tianyuan Continent was undoubtedly the core of the Four Sacred Star Domains. No one could replace its position as the continent's ruler.

"Alas, I wonder if others have returned yet!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, his expression filled with concern.

"Who are you? Why are you lingering around my Tianyuan Continent?" As the group murmured, a cold voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. Two tall young men flew toward them.

Their cultivation was not high—Beyond the Ordinary—but they were young, and their talent was commendable. However, their eyes carried an air of arrogance. They looked at Luo Tian's group but could not discern their cultivation, yet they did not care, for this was the Tianyuan Continent, and it was the Five Elements Sect.

"Ugh..." Hearing the two young men's words, Luo Tian and his group were momentarily stunned. They hadn't expected to be stopped by two juniors on their own doorstep.

"Are you talking to us?" Cao Dedu pointed at himself, his face showing confusion. He hadn't expected these two youths to not recognize Luo Tian.

"Of course, is there anyone else here?" The two young men surveyed Luo Tian's group with a glance. When they saw Sun Mengru and Fu Xingxuan, their eyes lit up instantly, their expressions turning dazed.

Seeing their expressions, Luo Tian's brow furrowed slightly before he let out a cold hum. An invisible wave rushed into their minds, snapping them back to reality.

Luo Tian didn't take it too seriously; after all, Sun Mengru and Fu Xingxuan were both breathtakingly beautiful. It was natural for these two youths to react this way upon encountering them.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian shook his head gently and spoke to Sun Mengru and the others.

"Indeed, it's now the younger generation's time; no one recognizes us anymore..." Xu Liyi and the others chuckled, following Luo Tian toward the Tianyuan Continent.

"Wait!" As they had just taken a step, the two young men suddenly blocked their path and barked at Luo Tian's group.

"Who are you? Why are you entering our Tianyuan Continent!" The two young men looked at Luo Tian's group with arrogance, asking.

"Who is that woman with the purple hair? I thought she was from the Ancient Celestial Clan's Star Moon Divine Race?" The two young men then turned their gaze to Fu Xingxuan, shouting at Luo Tian.

"Ugh..." Hearing the two young men's words, Luo Tian and his group's faces momentarily stiffened. They hadn't expected to be questioned like this by these two youths, and they had even guessed correctly.

"Leave that woman behind; we need to investigate!" The two young men addressed Luo Tian, their eyes flickering with greed.

But they could not escape the group's perception; two mere Beyond the Ordinary cultivators dared to scold a group of准纪元之主 and peak Realm masters. If someone had a strange temper, they might have wiped them out immediately.

"Do you know who you're talking to?" Seeing their greed, Luo Tian's face turned icy. His aura suddenly rose and pressed upon the two youths' bodies.

"Crack..." The two young men could not withstand Luo Tian's pressure and instantly fell to their knees, fear replacing their previous arrogance.

"You... you..." The two youths now fully understood they had offended the wrong people.

"Don't kill me... this is the Tianyuan Continent, and my father's uncle's nephew's grandmother's husband's third cousin is a renowned figure in the Tianyuan Continent, Zheng Xin!" One of the youths stammered.

"Smack..." Before the youth finished speaking, a crisp slap echoed on his face. Immediately after, a crackling sound followed from the youth's head.

"Ah, I'm so scared..." Cao Dedu smirked and stepped toward the youth. Without a word, he raised his hand and slapped the youth across the face.

"Spit..." Cao Dedu held back, not killing the youth outright.

"What's your name?" Luo Tian's face bore coldness as he gazed at the youth, clearly不满 with his attitude.

Previously, the youth had been arrogant and looked down on them all. Luo Tian and his group hadn't taken it seriously, as they were from the Four Sacred Star Domains. However, the youth had then shown interest in Fu Xingxuan. If they truly recognized Fu Xingxuan as a Star Moon Divine Race member, Luo Tian would never believe it.

These two were clearly on a mission here, representing the face of the Tianyuan Continent. How would others react if they encountered this? Zheng Xin was a peer of Luo Tian's domain master in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Though he wasn't particularly strong, he was a peak Realm master, and in the eyes of other sects, he was already a formidable figure. Everyone knew Zheng Xin's relationship with Luo Tian; these two youths clearly used the Tianyuan Continent as a crutch, damaging its reputation.

"Earlier, I heard Jiang Nanxuan say that the Four Sacred Star Domains had changed; some people were overly arrogant. I hadn't expected to encounter this!" Xu Liyi sighed softly, his expression darkening. He and Luo Tian hadn't returned to the Four Sacred Star Domains in years, yet they had encountered this immediately upon returning.

"What... are you?" The youth gazed at Luo Tian's group, their conversation leaving him confused. However, he recognized their appearances slightly.

These two youths weren't high in status within the Five Elements Sect; they had only heard of Luo Tian. As for the statue of Luo Tian on Mount Wuxing, they had only seen it from afar.

"I am Luo Tian..." Luo Tian's voice carried coldness as he surveyed the two youths, and their faces turned pale.

A scent spread through the starry sky as they trembled violently, eyes wide with disbelief.

"Luo... Luo Domain Master... mercy!" The youth stammered, never expecting to meet the missing Luo Tian after years.

"Don't resist; otherwise, you'll face consequences!" Luo Tian addressed them, though he knew that every sect inevitably had pests. Even the most righteous sects had dark corners, impossible to avoid entirely.

Luo Tian couldn't constantly monitor everyone in the sect, but since he had encountered them, he would definitely deal with it.

Faced with Luo Tian, the two youths dared not resist. They let Luo Tian search their souls, fearing that this person would wipe them out with a single misstep.

"Hmph..." After searching their souls, Luo Tian's face turned icy. These two had been bullying for years, gaining many benefits. Many female cultivators from small sects had suffered under their control—some even willingly, as these two youths were still Five Elements Sect disciples.

"Luo Tian!" As Luo Tian let out a cold hum, a series of excited voices echoed from behind him. A group of figures burst forth from the Tianyuan Continent, their gazes filled with excitement as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Zheng Xin, Sun Kelnian!" They soon spotted Zheng Xin among the crowd, a look of joy on his face. He hadn't expected Zheng Xin to return to the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Luo Tian, where have you been? Why did you return now!" Zheng Xin also looked delighted, gazing at Luo Tian's group. They had been scattered by Wan Lingkong's transmission array, and he didn't know where the others were.

"Where did you get transmitted to?" Luo Tian asked, scanning the crowd with a glance. He didn't see Chen Zhanbiao and felt slightly disappointed.

Among the group, Luo Tian was most concerned about Chen Zhanbiao. Though his strength was formidable, his mind was simple. Even after awakening the蛮王 bloodline, he had improved mentally, but Luo Tian still worried about being manipulated by others.

"Never mind; I was directly transmitted to the Four Sacred Star Domains, right here on the Tianyuan Continent!" Zheng Xin shook his head gently.

"Damn..." Hearing Zheng Xin's words, Xu Liyi and Cao Dedu couldn't help but curse softly. Compared to Zheng Xin's transmission experience, theirs had been truly miserable.

"Everyone else has sent messages, but Zhanbiao and Wan Lingkong haven't returned!" Zheng Xin spoke again.

"That bastard must have transmitted himself away!" Cao Dedu and the others wore expressions of satisfaction.

"Maybe, that bastard is more slippery than anyone; don't worry about him. But where did Zhanbiao end up? That's a problem!" They discussed again, worried about Chen Zhanbiao's personality getting him into trouble outside.

"Let's deal with this matter first!" Luo Tian's face darkened as he glanced at the two youths who had already urinated themselves. He then turned to Zheng Xin.

"What's going on?" Zheng Xin looked puzzled, his expression confused. He didn't know why Luo Tian was looking at him like that.

"Zheng Xin, you're really impressive! Do you know who these two are? They're your relatives!" Cao Dedu's face bore mockery as he looked at Zheng Xin.

"Relatives?" Hearing Luo Tian's group, Zheng Xin was confused. He had no memory of having such distant relatives.

"His father's uncle's grandmother's... whatever it was, it's you!" Cao Dedu couldn't remember the youth's exact words.

"What?" Zheng Xin grew more confused, a distant relative—how could he remember?

"Yes, that kind of thing. He's using your name here to bully people and block us; he even wanted to possess Mengru and Fu Xingxuan!" Xu Liyi added, looking at Zheng Xin.

"Damn it!" Hearing their words, Zheng Xin's face changed immediately. Looking at Luo Tian's cold expression, he broke out in a sweat.

"I'll kill these two pests and clear the way for the two sisters!" Zheng Xin wiped his sweat, looking at Sun Mengru and Fu Xingxuan with flattery.

"Better to offend Luo Tian than to offend these two!" His wife was very close with Sun Mengru and the others. If Sun Mengru said something to his wife, he wouldn't get a good outcome!

After saying that, Zheng Xin glared at the two youths with hatred. He hated these bastards who were completely unrelated to him but had defamed his name outside.

The two youths urinated and defecated simultaneously, unable to withstand the gaze of these masters. They fainted instantly.

"Truly bizarre; Zheng Xin is bizarre, and your relatives are also bizarre!" Seeing the two youths' pitiful state, Cao Dedu and Xu Liyi's eyes carried mockery.

"Severely punish them; they don't deserve death, but a punishment will do. Expel them from the Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, though encountering this incident upon returning didn't affect his mood.

"Zheng Tianyao, come out! These two bastards are yours; if they don't have trauma, I'll skin you!" Zheng Xin shouted at Zheng Tianyao in the crowd.

"Oh..." Zheng Tianyao had also become a youth, bearing no resemblance to Zheng Xin's demeanor. His entire presence exuded calmness and adherence to propriety.

"Is this your biological son? He doesn't look like you at all!" Seeing Zheng Tianyao's honest appearance, Cao Dedu couldn't help but mock.

"Rubbish! He's definitely my son!" Zheng Xin cursed, watching Zheng Tianyao take the two youths away.

"Go too!" Then Zheng Xin was uneasy, as his son was too upright. He addressed Gu Lei's son, Gu Tianyu, and Zimo.

"Alright!" The younger ones' faces carried excitement, especially Gu Tianyu's mischievous grin as he took the two unconscious youths away. The older generation stood under the starry sky.

"I suspect Gu Tianyu was switched with your son when he was born!" Cao Dedu looked at Gu Tianyu's sly eyes and spoke again, prompting everyone to laugh.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed the group. Their figures shimmered, disappearing into the starry sky. This incident was merely a minor detour for them.

"Let's整顿 the Four Sacred Star Domains!" They sat in the hall, Luo Tian addressing everyone with a deep gaze.

"A dike collapses from an ant's hole; if even distant relatives like Zheng Xin are so arrogant, what would closer ones be like?"

"Although we can't completely stop it, we can't ignore it either!" Luo Tian spoke seriously, scanning the crowd.

"Yes, Jiang Nanxuan had also expressed such concerns before. However, recent events in the Nine Realms have been too numerous; you were all away, and manpower was insufficient. Therefore, this matter was delayed. Now that you've returned, it's time to clean up the garbage in the Tianyuan Continent!" Jiang Sici spoke, her gaze authoritative.

"By the way, where is Jiang Nanxuan?" Luo Tian had been puzzled since returning. He hadn't seen Jiang Nanxuan and Gu Lei upon his return; now it was Jiang Sici who was in charge of the Tianyuan Continent.

"The Leihai Marsh's burial coffin might have been opened by the Ancient Celestial Clan. Jiang Nanxuan and Gu Lei took the ancient palace to investigate in the Thunder Domain!"

"Meanwhile, the Starry Realm also had a sanctuary-like entity called the All-Heavenly Alliance. This alliance was composed of many of your enemies!" Jiang Sici spoke softly, recounting the situation across the Nine Realms to Luo Tian and his group.

Chapter 1633: The Fluctuation of the Demon Emperor

"An All-Heavenly Alliance? Enemies?" Hearing Jiang Sici's words, Luo Tian's brow furrowed slightly. He had many enemies; if they all united, it would be a terrifying force.

"Yes, but they seem low-key; they haven't made any major moves against the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Jiang Sici shook her head, her gaze heavy. This All-Heavenly Alliance was a thorn in their side, unknown when it would erupt.

"Let's set aside the All-Heavenly Alliance for now; the Ancient Celestial Clan is the real issue. How could you let Jiang Nanxuan go to the Thunder Domain? That burial coffin—we've touched it before; whoever touches it dies!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, recalling the terrifying aura they had felt when opening the coffin.

"They're just investigating; they don't plan to confront the Ancient Celestial Clan!" Jiang Sici spoke.

"Yes, but they've already gone; let's wait for their return. The Ancient Celestial Clan said a hundred years were coming up. Once they return, I'll also go to the Ancient Celestial Clan!" Luo Tian looked at Fu Xingxuan, clearly indicating she had her own challenges.

"Hmph..." Hearing Luo Tian's words and seeing his gaze, Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan's faces turned icy.

"Hey, Luo Tian, I need to go home and see my wife!" Seeing Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan's cold gazes, the people in the hall felt a chill.

"I need to go too..." Cao Dedu spoke softly, following Xu Liyi out of the hall.

"Damn it, I'm going to see my wife; why are you following me? Go back to your demon domain!" A shout echoed from outside the hall.

"Ha ha, I'll go home too!" Others also chuckled, finding excuses to leave the hall.

However, only one person remained in the hall—Yao Chen, as he still wanted to see if the Demon Emperor's statue had any connection with him.

"What... where should I go?" Yao Chen looked at the empty hall, his face slightly embarrassed. He felt radiant, illuminating the entire hall.

"What... I need to accompany the monkey with some matters!" Luo Tian looked at Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan's eyes that could kill, shrinking his head before fleeing out of the hall.

"You're not a real man!" Seeing Luo Tian's intention to flee, Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan spoke coldly. Sun Mengru smiled, arms crossed as she watched the commotion.

Fu Xingxuan was slightly embarrassed, looking at Luo Tian's three wives with a red face, wishing for a hole to dig.

"What... you all chat first; I'll go now!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly, feeling that if he stayed longer, the glances from three women would kill him.

"Tonight, I'll deal with them one by one!" Luo Tian grabbed Yao Chen and rushed out of the hall, their figures shimmering as they flew toward the Tian Dao Sect.

Not long after, Luo Tian and Yao Chen arrived at the Tianyuan Continent's Tian Dao Sect. The entire sect was peaceful.

Walking on Mount Tian Dao, Luo Tian and Yao Chen felt an unusual calmness. The entire Mount Tian Dao seemed to emit a strange aura, calming their restless hearts.

"Unexpectedly, the Mount Tian Dao has changed so much in these years!" Luo Tian mused, walking with Yao Chen through the respectful gazes of the sect's disciples toward the mountain's peak.

Now, the location where Zhang Daotian and his three companions' statues stood had become a forbidden zone. No one of low status could approach it.

Luo Tian was certainly not among them. He led Yao Chen quickly to the mountain's peak, where four statues radiated divine grace. Over the years, these four statues had become even more lifelike, causing Luo Tian's face to light up with joy.

"Perhaps it truly can be revived!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with surprise, his spiritual sense instantly entering the statues. His joy deepened further.

Within his spiritual sense, four illusory souls fused with the statues. Though they were intangible, if anyone else had noticed, they wouldn't have realized it. However, Luo Tian could clearly sense the presence of these four souls.

"This..." Before Luo Tian recovered from his surprise, Yao Chen's eyes burst with golden light, gazing at the Demon Emperor's statue with disbelief.

"Luo Tian!" Zhang Ziping and his three brothers stood up slowly, a smile on their faces as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Three Senior Brothers!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to them, feeling the deepest regret for his three senior brothers. They had been outstanding talents, each with strong cultivation. Now, merely their presence made Luo Tian feel uneasy.

"How did it go? This time, will you stay in the Four Sacred Star Domains and not leave?" Zhang Ziping gazed at Luo Tian, sensing his aura and feeling a sense of oppression.

"Thank you for your hard work! I have some matters to attend to; after that, I'll stay in the Tianyuan Continent and wait for the Ancient Celestial Clan's hundred-year agreement!" Luo Tian waved his hand, retrieving the Tian Dao Thunder Sword that had ascended to a Realm Treasure and handing it to Zhang Ziping.

"You keep it; we don't need anything now!" Zhang Ziping pushed the Tian Dao Thunder Sword back.

"Buzz..." As they spoke, a gust of wind rose around Luo Tian. Yao Chen's body trembled with energy, his blood boiling as he approached the Demon Emperor's statue. His entire body shook violently.

Seeing the Demon Emperor's statue, Yao Chen felt his bloodline was being drawn to it, a strange and intimate aura rising within him. This feeling made Yao Chen extremely excited.

"His body truly has my father's aura!" Yao Chen spoke softly, then knelt before the statue.

As Yao Chen knelt down, a drop of blood instantly flew from his finger and landed in the statue's eyes.

"Buzz..." The humming echoed, a wave of energy instantly spreading from the statue, causing Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping's four faces to show surprise.

Golden light rose, the blood of Yao Chen seeping into the statue. Golden radiance burst from the statue's eyes.

Luo Tian didn't hesitate and carefully observed the reaction of the illusory soul within the statue.

"This..." His face then showed disbelief; the illusory Demon Emperor's soul had become more solid, and a momentary burst of powerful spiritual sense emerged.

"Crack..." The statue emitted a series of cracking sounds, fine cracks appearing on its surface.

"What's happening!" Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen's faces turned serious. They could also sense a soul within the statue now.

"Roar..." A gray soul transformed into the form of a battle saint monkey, as if trying to break free from the statue's constraints.

A roar shook heaven and earth, an invisible aura spreading across Mount Tian Dao, instantly sweeping through the entire Tianyuan Continent.

The entire Tianyuan Continent's time seemed to pause at this roar, with everyone feeling an overwhelming aura emanating from Mount Tian Dao.

However, it was only a moment before returning to normal, leaving people astonished and looking toward Mount Tian Dao.

"There's something good here!" Sun Kelen had been listless, but at the moment this fluctuation appeared, he instantly became energetic. His eyes glowed with greed as he flew toward Mount Tian Dao.

Others also stood up, eager to see what fluctuation could be so powerful. However, before they moved, Zhang Ziping's voice rose from Mount Tian Dao.

"Return!" His calm voice was unusually霸道, causing the entire Tianyuan Continent to quiet again. Though they hadn't appeared for years, those who knew Zhang Ziping's temperament understood he never backed down. Once, a self-important disciple had defied Zhang Ziping and was suppressed by him; he hadn't emerged since.

That disciple had been a descendant of an old ancestor in the Five Elements Sect. With those old ancestors' deaths, their descendants held high status within the Five Elements Sect. Though not as high as Zheng Xin's descendants, they still had significant status.

From that incident, people knew Mount Tian Dao was a special place in the Tianyuan Continent. Even the Five Elements Sect couldn't act recklessly there.

"This truly is my father's soul!" After the soul strengthened, Yao Chen's face was filled with excitement as he spoke to Luo Tian and the others.

"The Demon Emperor is a Realm Master, the Divine Emperor Tian!" Yao Chen's words had just finished when Lei Yong and Ji Chen's faces showed disbelief.

"So, our masters' ability to live through a second life is also related to the Divine Emperor Tian?" Zhang Ziping's face bore confusion as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Perhaps! Of course, it might also be related to our master. Now that we've confirmed it, it means they truly can live through a second life and may become even stronger after returning!" Lei Yong spoke, his voice filled with excitement. They now truly felt the soul and strong vitality within the Demon Emperor's statue.

"Our master is indeed an extraordinary person!" Luo Tian smiled, thinking of Mei Xueyin encountered in the Bone Forest.

"Master?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zhang Ziping and his three faces showed confusion as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Yes, our master might have been a仙 (immortal)!" Luo Tian smiled and spoke to them. His words caused Zhang Ziping's three faces to widen in surprise, a rare sight for Luo Tian.

Chapter 1634: Xu Liyi's Plan

Luo Tian observed their expressions before speaking softly, recounting the events in the Bone Forest to them. They were all disciples of Zhang Daotian, naturally connected with Mei Xueyin's mention of the仙 (immortal) world.

"So, our Tian Dao Sect also has a lineage in the仙 (immortal) world? And it was destroyed? Or perhaps by a formidable仙王?" Lei Yong spoke softly, his gaze heavy.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded, scanning the three senior brothers with a glance. This was their matter, so he didn't want others involved. Moreover, becoming an immortal in the Nine Realms was difficult; perhaps they wouldn't become one in this life.

"Enhance our strength! If the master truly returns, he might regain his仙 (immortal) memories. Then, the master will definitely seek to attack the仙 (immortal) world, clashing with that仙王!" Zhang Ziping sighed deeply before his eyes glowed with intense battle spirit.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen's auras rose, their battle spirit evident without fear.

Yao Chen slowly stood up, gazing at Luo Tian and his three senior brothers with admiration. Even facing an仙王 far beyond their cultivation, they showed no fear. Just this mindset made their achievements hard to be low.

Then, Yao Chen's face glowed with radiant light, gazing at Zhang Daotian's statue. He hadn't expected him to be related to the仙 (immortal) world. Perhaps his father's current state was also connected with him.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian smiled, speaking to Yao Chen after chatting with Zhang Ziping and the others. It was already late, and he had a lot of matters to handle at home.

"Yes!" Yao Chen nodded, his eyes filled with battle spirit as he and Luo Tian descended from Mount Tian Dao.
