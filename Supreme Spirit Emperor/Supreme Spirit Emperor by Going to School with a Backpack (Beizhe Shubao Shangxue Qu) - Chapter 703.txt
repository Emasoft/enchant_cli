The gray mist was precisely the method Luo Tian had previously set upon the Demon Lord. At that time, Luo Tian had discovered a hidden base of the Luoshengmen faction within the Wheel Turning Hall through this very technique.

Swoosh...

The gray mist shot forth from Luo Tian's hand, heading in a different direction than the group.

"Let's go. I hope we meet Qiu Chan again!" Luo Tian sighed softly. The last time he had seen Leng Qiuchan was with the Demon Lord, and Luo Tian hoped to see her again this time. The five of them turned around and flew toward the northeast direction of Hell.

Time passed slowly, seven days had elapsed. A bone-chilling wind swept across the heavens and earth, biting cold and accompanied by swirling black snowflakes.

On the ground, many ghost cultivators of Hell walked about. This was the domain ruled by the苦神殿 (Suffering God Palace). The power of the Suffering God Palace was peculiar—eternal coldness, with winds that never ceased. No matter one's cultivation level, the chill was felt, making it the most harsh environment among the Ten Palaces of Yama.

The environment in Hell was already terrible, but within the Suffering God Palace it was even worse. Thus, few people resided there—perhaps due to the environment, but those who dwelled in this faction were all fierce warriors with a rugged and bold nature.

A towering black mountain stood amidst the heavens, its surroundings avoided by all. Anyone who entered this mountain never returned.

At the summit of the mountain stood a grand hall, where three figures sat within.

"Rest assured, since you've arrived here, place your heart in your chest!" A middle-aged man spoke confidently.

The man wore a black robe, had a long face with a mustache that twitched when he spoke. His eyes were small and glinted with greed, gazing at a figure seated beside him.

"With Master Chen's presence, we are at ease!" A burly man smiled and addressed the middle-aged man.

"Master Chen, you've been here for a while now. How are you adjusting?" The sly middle-aged man smiled gently and addressed the woman seated there.

The two were Leng Qiuchan and the Demon Lord. Previously, Luo Tian and Hei Bai Wu Chang had annihilated their factions.

The Demon Lord had escaped, and Leng Qiuchan too had fled after sustaining heavy injuries. In her desperation, she contacted the Demon Lord and together they had come here.

When Leng Qiuchan arrived, she was in a pitiful state. She immediately chose to retreat into seclusion, but her appearance had been seen by Master Chen, who was instantly captivated by her beauty.

"Fair enough. Thank you for your help, Master Chen. Once my injuries are fully healed, I will depart and not bring trouble to your doorstep. This is a debt of gratitude I owe you," Leng Qiuchan spoke softly, her gaze toward the middle-aged man filled with discomfort.

"Master Chen, have you considered my proposal? I am sincere, and the heavens bear witness!" The middle-aged man's eyes burned with fervor as he gazed at Leng Qiuchan.

"Master Chen, please stop bringing this up. We are not suited for each other," Leng Qiuchan replied softly, having been hounded by him since her arrival.

Crack!

A crackling sound echoed as the middle-aged man's cup shattered in his hand. His face darkened, and his mustache twitched violently.

"Don't be ungrateful. You'll agree whether you want to or not!" The middle-aged man sneered, having finally lost patience. He slowly rose and gazed at Leng Qiuchan.

"Chen Deye, what are you planning?" Leng Qiuchan also rose, her aura rising as she gazed coldly at the middle-aged man.

"Two masters, don't be angry. Let's talk things over!" The Demon Lord also rose, smiling and gazing at Leng Qiuchan and Chen Deye.

Chen Deye's face twisted into a grimace, his eyes glaring fiercely at Leng Qiuchan as he took a step toward her.

"Although I am injured, I'm not someone you can bully!" Leng Qiuchan coldly replied. A green long sword materialized in her hand. She admitted she owed Chen Deye a debt of gratitude, but the way to repay it was definitely not this.

"Little beauty, do you think you can escape my grasp? Have you no idea whose territory this is?" Chen Deye sneered at Leng Qiuchan, who had drawn her sword. He showed no concern and struck a finger, sending waves of energy that instantly enveloped the room.

In an instant, black seals wrapped around Leng Qiuchan, pinning her in place with no ability to move.

"Haha, Master Chen congratulates you!" The Demon Lord smiled as he saw Leng Qiuchan immobilized, gazing at Chen Deye.

"Thanks to you as well. Once I succeed, the Half of Tianxia Mountain will be mine!" Chen Deye replied and stepped closer to Leng Qiuchan.

The Demon Lord, sensing the situation, exited the hall and closed the door behind him.

"Alas, it's a pity. Once she was my superior, now reduced to this old man's plaything!" The Demon Lord sighed inwardly. He knew what Chen Deye was like—numerous concubines, never treating his women as people.

Just as the Demon Lord stepped out, five figures appeared in his line of sight, causing him to display an expression of disbelief.

Luo Tian held a corpse in his hand and carelessly tossed it to the ground, making no sound.

"Long time no see!" Luo Tian saw the Demon Lord and smiled, though this smile sent chills down the Demon Lord's spine.

Chapter 2640: Seize Her!

"Who are you!" The Demon Lord exclaimed, utterly surprised that Luo Tian's group had followed them here.

"I've been tailed!" The Demon Lord's heart sank. He was intelligent enough to realize that either he or Leng Qiuchan had revealed their location, or perhaps a mark had been placed on them to track their movements.

"How is this possible? I felt nothing!" The Demon Lord was horrified, checking himself thoroughly but finding no signs of the mark.

"Run!" The Demon Lord didn't hesitate, leaping into the air and fleeing. He had no courage to confront Luo Tian's group.

Plop...

Blood spewed from the Demon Lord's mouth, forming blood seals on his wings. His bone wings flapped, and he transformed into a streak of light, fleeing swiftly.

"Where do you think you're going!" A booming voice echoed. Diao Dezhu stood with his hands behind his back, radiating an overwhelming aura. The immense pressure made the Demon Lord's mind shatter.

Diao Dezhu did not block the Demon Lord but let him go, a triumphant smile on his face. "Invincibility is so lonely. An Immortal King, even he lacks the courage to fight me."

However, Luo Tian's group ignored Diao Dezhu and stood before the black hall. Luo Tian raised his fist and struck it toward the grand hall.

Boom...

The punch shattered the heavens, and the black hall crumbled under Luo Tian's fist, turning into swirling dust that filled their vision.

Yet as the hall collapsed, Luo Tian's eyes flashed with killing intent. He stepped onto the ground and rushed into the dust.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before Chen Deye, who was in a state of bewilderment. At that moment, Chen Deye was removing his clothes, while Leng Qiuchan stood frozen, her face flushed.

"Die!" Luo Tian struck a punch at Chen Deye's body. The latter was sent flying over a hundred feet, spitting blood and his chest caved in.

"Who are you? Help!" Chen Deye's eyes were filled with terror as he spoke, spitting out blood.

"You're the last one. When you find your subordinates, we'll send you over!" A purple figure appeared behind Chen Deye, eyes filled with pity for the man who would surely meet a grim end.

Chen Deye slapped his body and stood up, his mind in absolute horror. To be silently eliminated by someone who could take down all of his forces was beyond comprehension.

Thus, Chen Deye's thoughts were the same as the Demon Lord—escape. If he couldn't flee, given this person's demeanor, he would surely die today.

But as soon as Chen Deye stood up, a thunderous sound echoed above him. A massive hammer descended from the sky, striking Chen Deye.

Chen Deye felt his head throb with pain and fell to the ground, his head buried in it, instantly passing out.

"How are you?" Luo Tian approached Leng Qiuchan, his gaze filled with concern. At that moment, Leng Qiuchan's breath was uneven.

"Once I deal with him, I'll help you break the seal!" Luo Tian strode forward, examining Leng Qiuchan. Finding her energy unstable but no serious issues, he approached the Chen Deye who had been struck to the ground.

Luo Tian grabbed Chen Deye by the throat, lifting him up.

At that moment, as Luo Tian clutched Chen Deye's throat, the unconscious man suddenly opened his eyes. His two eyes turned ink-black, and two fangs shot from his mouth, aiming to pierce Luo Tian's arm.

Crack crack...

Chen Deye's mouth emitted a series of cracking sounds. His two arms simultaneously reached for Luo Tian's head, long nails extending and emitting a cold glow.

Having prepared for this, Chen Deye was an Immortal King at the middle stage. He wouldn't have been so easily knocked out.

Chen Deye knew he couldn't break free, and these people were all stronger than him. The only way was to strike unexpectedly, aiming to injure one of them and escape.

Chen Deye's sudden attack was indeed unexpected, but he didn't know the person before him was Luo Tian. A seasoned warrior who had encountered countless such tricks, and even used them himself.

In an instant, Luo Tian kicked out his foot toward Chen Deye's ribs while simultaneously raising a hand to form a ghost claw, striking at Chen Deye's head.

"Ahh..." Before Chen Deye could touch Luo Tian, he felt an agonizing pain in his most vulnerable spot and instinctively clutched it.

At the same time, Chen Deye's head was directly crushed by Luo Tian. Blood splattered and stained Luo Tian's face.

"Think this is over?" Luo Tian extended his hand, drawing out a gray soul and placing it in his palm. Chen Deye's eyes were filled with terror as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"You're a devil!" Chen Deye exclaimed, seemingly stunned. He kept muttering, but ten-colored flames rose from Luo Tian's fingertips, forming a fiery cage that trapped Chen Deye.

Luo Tian took out a jade bottle and pressed an imprint. The bottle emitted a strong suction, and the ten-colored flames enveloped Chen Deye as he was drawn into the bottle.

"Forty-nine days, and he will be completely annihilated!" Luo Tian spoke to Leng Qiuchan. He approached her.

"Qiuchan, come back with me. Forgive me, no matter what your reasons are, I can face them with you," Luo Tian spoke to Leng Qiuchan, his gaze filled with guilt.

"Let me go!" Leng Qiuchan spoke. At that moment, she felt her body burning with heat, and a bad premonition arose—Chen Deye had given her something.

"Okay, but you must promise me not to run!" Luo Tian looked at Leng Qiuchan's flushed face, puzzled but still extended a hand. A gust of ten-colored flame wind entered Leng Qiuchan's body.

At the same time, the cold aura surrounding Leng Qiuchan disappeared. This disappearance was even more alarming, as if a long-repressed fire had suddenly spread throughout Leng Qiuchan's body.

"Damn it!" Leng Qiuchan cursed inwardly, realizing what Chen Deye had given her.

"Love potion!" Luo Tian exclaimed in surprise, recalling that he too had experienced it before—more than once.

"Son of a bitch!" Luo Tian muttered, lifting Leng Qiuchan and flying into the air.

"Go to the Jiugui King City, I'll be back soon!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in Diao Dezhu's group. His figure had already vanished.

Chapter 2641: Late Night Visitor

Luo Tian carried Leng Qiuchan and flew out of the Tianxia Mountain, vanishing from Diao Dezhu's group's sight.

"What's wrong with this kid? He just left!" Ren Hongzhe looked puzzled, watching Luo Tian's urgent manner.

"Let's go back. We've been through a lot and need to rest," Xiang Tianming spoke softly, leading the group toward the Jiugui King City.

Luo Tian flew through a mountain forest, finding a large mountain and creating a cave with his hand. He set up a barrier and rushed into the cave with Leng Qiuchan.

As soon as they entered, their bodies entwined. To Luo Tian, it was nothing new; if Leng Qiuchan remained like this, it would harm her body.

Dry wood met fire; the cold cave was unusually warm. After an hour, Leng Qiuchan finally calmed down.

Luo Tian could feel her energy growing colder, the cold energy falling onto him.

"Qiuchan, come back with me. Forgive me," Luo Tian gazed at Leng Qiuchan's tears, his heart aching. He wanted to embrace her but found his hands gradually stiffening.

Leng Qiuchan dressed herself, gazing at Luo Tian with a hint of regret. However, she turned and left the cave.

"Qiuchan!" Luo Tian wanted to speak but found he could not utter a word.

"I'm sorry," Leng Qiuchan appeared at the cave's entrance, sighing and clenching her fists. Her eyes gradually turned gray.

"Get down!" Leng Qiuchan commanded, emitting a destructive aura. Blood spilled from her mouth.

Leng Qiuchan stepped on the ground, flying upward and vanishing at the mountain's peak. She left Luo Tian alone there.

"What was it for?" Luo Tian stood motionless, watching Leng Qiuchan leave the cave but not seeing what happened after.

An hour later, Luo Tian's body returned to normal, yet he still stood there, tightly clenching his fists.

"She had regret in her eyes. There must be some reason preventing Qiuchan from returning," Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination.

"Luoshengmen, what kind of faction is it?" Luo Tian muttered softly, his voice filled with killing intent.

Luo Tian dressed himself and exited the cave, flying toward the Jiugui King City. While flying, he pondered what to do next.

After ten days, Luo Tian finally returned to the Jiugui King City. Upon seeing him return, Diao Dezhu's group looked puzzled—they had just returned when Luo Tian arrived.

"Where is Miss Qiuchan?" Upon seeing Luo Tian, Su Dan appeared, her eyes filled with excitement. She rushed to his side and looked around, having heard that Luo Tian had carried Leng Qiuchan away.

"She left..." Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at Su Dan. Her face darkened instantly.

"She has her reasons," Luo Tian spoke, stepping into his courtyard. He needed to think deeply.

No one disturbed Luo Tian because Diao Dezhu and the others understood him. They knew he needed silence now, as Leng Qiuchan not returning had greatly affected him.

"Let him be alone. This kid is sentimental," Xiang Tianming spoke, sighing and heading to Su Peng's assigned courtyard.

Luo Tian sat alone in the courtyard, meditating with his legs crossed. His mind recalled Leng Qiuchan's eyes filled with regret.

"Luoshengmen, I must destroy it to save Qiuchan!"

"The line of the Demon Lord can still be used, but obviously not for long. What then? Luoshengmen is stronger than Tianyuan Sect. If I bring the entire Tianyuan Sect, maybe we can fight it, but it might end in mutual destruction!" Luo Tian was troubled and couldn't think of a solution.

Buzz...

As Luo Tian pondered, waves rose from outside his room. A streak of light flashed, and Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. He extended his hand to grasp a jade slip.

"Who!" Luo Tian shouted, moving instantly outside his room but finding no one.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed with seriousness. He extended his spiritual sense, yet there was no movement. He picked up the jade slip and crushed it.

"Ten thousand miles away from Wu Hua Palace, the Ancestral God Mountain—Luoshengmen's base!" A line of text was imprinted in Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Someone who could escape his spiritual sense and infiltrate the Jiugui King City must be either powerful or skilled in stealth.

"Enemy or ally?" Luo Tian muttered, and Su Peng appeared at his side.

"You felt the waves!" Su Peng spoke, gazing at Luo Tian. When Su Peng was captured, Su Peng had activated a method left by the First King of Jiugui.

"Yes, someone came!" Luo Tian nodded and explained the situation to Su Peng.

"How is that possible? Even if it were the Ten Palaces of Yama, I would sense them!" Su Peng exclaimed upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

"Who is it? So skilled?" Upon hearing Su Peng's words, Luo Tian was also puzzled. He looked around and then noticed a pool of water at his feet.

"This is the scent of Huangquan (Yellow Spring)!" Luo Tian sniffed, recognizing it as Huangquan water.

"Strange," Su Peng furrowed his brows. This matter was neither big nor small.

"For now, it's probably not an enemy. If it were, he would have had an 80% chance of succeeding in ambushing me!" Luo Tian replied, thinking about the person's message. He wasn't sure if it was trustworthy.

"Be careful," Su Peng sighed, "the world has been too unstable lately. Even the Ten Palaces are like this. They don't understand the principle of 'first pacify the inside before dealing with outsiders.'"

"Yes, I'll be careful," Luo Tian nodded and returned to his room.

"The line of the Demon Lord can wait. I'll see if this person's information is accurate!" Luo Tian made his decision. He had no other options but to do his best.

After a night's rest, the next day, Luo Tian left the Jiugui King City alone. This time he was heading to Wu Hua Palace, unsure if the person's information was accurate.

If it were before, Luo Tian would not have gone. But now he was interested in Luoshengmen because Leng Qiuchan was still within it. He needed to understand Luoshengmen and rescue Leng Qiuchan. However, as soon as Luo Tian left the Jiugui King City, Diao Dezhu and Xiang Tianming's group appeared outside the city, smiling.

Chapter 2642: Meeting Yin Wu

Luo Tian flew through the dark sky. The entire Hell was vast, and Wu Hua Palace was located to the west of Jiugui King City.

Along the way, there were few people in Hell, obviously engaged in fighting against the Immortal realm. Hell was somewhat empty.

Time passed slowly. After seven days of flying, Luo Tian arrived at Wu Hua Palace's territory. The area around Wu Hua Palace was very prosperous, with more people than before. Luo Tian found a large city and stopped.

The city was named Wushuang City, located eight million miles from Wu Hua Palace. It was a famous city within Wu Hua Palace's territory. Upon entering the city, Luo Tian did not draw attention.

He found a guesthouse and rested. Although he was resting, his spiritual sense extended outward, listening to the conversations of people in the guesthouse.

"Did you hear? The Ancestral God Mountain has been making strange noises lately. There are also wind sounds, and sometimes it emits a suction force that pulls people outside the mountain into it. It's strange. Wu Hua Palace has sent people to investigate, but after seven days, there's been no news."

"Indeed. The Ancestral God Mountain is only ten thousand miles away from Wu Hua Palace. Either there's a rare treasure or a great danger. Wu Hua Palace wouldn't ignore it."

Luo Tian's mind was puzzled. He felt this might be a trap.

He decided not to go directly but to stay for several days, thoroughly investigating before making a decision. If it were indeed a trap, he might be doomed.

The next morning, Luo Tian left his accommodation and walked through the streets of Wushuang City.

As he walked, he noticed many ghost cultivators from Hell entering through the city gates. Some stayed, while others hurriedly entered through the northern gate and exited through the southern one.

"Luo Xiong!" A voice of surprise echoed behind Luo Tian, causing him to turn around.

"Yin Wu?" Luo Tian raised an eyebrow. He hadn't expected to meet the Holy Son of Wu Hua Palace here, and their relationship was not friendly.

"Is it for the Ancestral God Mountain matter?" Yin Wu approached Luo Tian, seemingly forgetting their previous hostility at the Wheel Turning Hall.

"I've heard about it. I'm just curious," Luo Tian replied softly.

"Any news, Yin Xiong?" Luo Tian asked gently. He could sense that the Ancestral God Mountain was not as simple as the person who gave him the message had said.

"I don't know much, but I do know some. Wu Hua Palace has sent two Immortal Kings to investigate, and they only returned with four words before going silent," Yin Wu spoke.

"World Heart!" Yin Wu didn't wait for Luo Tian to ask and spoke directly.

"World Heart?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. The only treasures that could draw the attention of the Ten Palaces of Yama were such rare items.

"Yes, it's the World Heart. Although the Ancestral God Mountain has had treasures before, they were of no use to Immortal Kings."

"However, I heard that a few True Immortals had entered the depths of the Ancestral God Mountain and found a great tomb. They only entered the entrance and took some middle-grade ghost weapons before leaving."

"As for the master of the tomb, no one knows. However, when they exited the entrance, a force had emerged. Based on that force, it was likely an ancient immortal."

Yin Wu continued speaking, recounting what he knew. Luo Tian was amazed.

"Ah, I see," Luo Tian nodded and decided to think it over. Yin Wu's words were not entirely trustworthy.

"I've been fighting in the Immortal realm and returned here for this matter. The Palace Master ordered me to go there, find our sect's strength, and see who the tomb belongs to," Yin Wu spoke softly.

"Why didn't your Palace Master go himself? After all, it's an ancient immortal's tomb!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. He seemed to understand Yin Wu's intention, clearly wanting his help.

"This is a test for me. If I succeed, I'll become the Palace Master of Wu Hua. If I fail, I'll have to wait," Yin Wu's face showed a bitter smile.

"I wish you all the best, Yin Xiong!" Luo Tian bowed and spoke. Yin Wu was momentarily stunned.

Luo Tian guessed correctly—Yin Wu indeed wanted his help. The tomb sounded complicated, and Luo Tian's strength was well known to him. He was a powerful ally. If Luo Tian could help, his chances of success would be greater.

"Wait, Luo Xiong!" Yin Wu was stunned and called out as Luo Tian turned to leave.

"Yin Xiong, is there something else?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of amusement. He had left to elevate his status.

"Yin Xiong, we had some misunderstandings before. I know that's because we were on different sides."

"Now, Tianyuan Sect's position isn't stable. If I become the Palace Master of Wu Hua, it would give me some say in Tianyuan Sect matters. Would you be willing to help me enter the Ancestral God Mountain?" Yin Wu replied, gazing at Luo Tian with anticipation. He believed Luo Tian would agree since his words were factual.

"Hmm... I'll think it over," Luo Tian mused for a while. His mind was weighing Yin Wu's words, but he instinctively felt the Ancestral God Mountain wasn't simple. It was likely someone wanted him to come here and get involved.

Thus, Luo Tian decided to think for two days. It was a matter of life and death, and his life was now very valuable. If he died, Tianyuan Sect would be unacceptable to the Immortal and Hell realms—either it would perish or be devoured. There was no time for a buffer.

Seeing Luo Tian hadn't agreed, Yin Wu's face changed instantly. He cursed inwardly, thinking Luo Tian was asking for too much.

"If you help me with this, I can guarantee that Wu Hua Palace won't mention Tianyuan Sect for ten years!" Yin Wu gritted his teeth and gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 2643: Heading to the Ancestral God Mountain

"An unexpected gain!" Luo Tian's eyes brightened. He hadn't expected Yin Wu to add another incentive.

"Yin Xiong, this isn't just about something else. I really need some time to think," Luo Tian said.

"Moreover, your words are empty. If you don't keep your promise, what can I do with the Palace Master of Wu Hua?" Luo Tian shrugged and gazed at Yin Wu helplessly.

"I can swear an oath!" Yin Wu spoke, gritting his teeth and gazing at Luo Tian with sincerity. He truly needed help; other sects' Holy Sons were also good allies, but their price would be higher than Luo Tian's. Plus, there was the World Heart—these Holy Sons would definitely compete.

"Three days. If I decide after three days, I'll give you an answer!" Luo Tian insisted on three days. He didn't want to rush and agree immediately.

"Three days? Other sects will also receive the news. You'll lose your advantage!" Yin Wu cursed inwardly but smiled: "Luo Xiong, this matter is very important to me. I don't know what you're worried about?"

"I have my reasons, Yin Xiong. Even if other sects' Holy Sons come, we'll regain the advantage," Luo Tian smiled and showed confidence. The Ten Palaces' Holy Sons were no longer a threat to him.

"Okay, but please hurry and give me an answer. I'll wait for you at the Ancestral God Mountain," Yin Wu said.

"We can discuss specific conditions later," Yin Wu bowed to Luo Tian. He couldn't wait here indefinitely; if Luo Tian refused, it would be a waste of time.

Luo Tian bowed to Yin Wu. They parted ways. Yin Wu walked toward the southern city gate, while Luo Tian wandered aimlessly through the streets, listening to people's discussions.

"Who is this person who gave me the message?" Luo Tian pondered, unable to figure out who among his acquaintances was so powerful.

This was the most troubling part for Luo Tian, fearing that the Ancestral God Mountain might be a trap against him. Even Yin Wu was not entirely trustworthy.

The strength of Luoshengmen lay in its powerful infiltration capabilities. The Ten Palaces of Yama didn't know who among them was a Luoshengmen agent, even including Holy Sons. Previously, Luo Tian had felt the killing intent of the Ten Palaces' Holy Sons toward him, aiming to kill him. Among those people was Yin Wu.

In Wushuang City, people came and went constantly. Many had heard about the Ancestral God Mountain and were heading there to seek their luck.

"Such people!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He had seen hundreds of people leave the southern gate during his wandering.

However, Luo Tian knew that many of these people would become sacrifices once they entered the Ancestral God Mountain. Still, many would persist in their pursuit of a chance to ascend rapidly.

Especially now, Hell had occupied three days of the Immortal realm. The entire Hell's power was massive, and so many places needed people to garrison. The stronger one was, the more they would gain.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian wandered for a day without hearing what he wanted, returning to his inn.

Night fell. Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the bed, pondering the pros and cons. In fact, he had already decided to go check it out.

An ancient immortal's tomb—its contents would definitely be valuable. Plus, Wu Hua Palace's strength had reported the World Heart.

Luo Tian needed strength—not just for Tianyuan Sect's stability, but also because he had a plan: to break through the void and enter the vast star fields to find the Nine Realms.

Buzz...

As Luo Tian sat in meditation, a familiar wave suddenly broke through the window and entered his room. This made Luo Tian open his eyes.

Luo Tian extended his hand to grasp a jade slip that fell into his palm. He moved instantly outside the room.

"Again, you!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at a pool of water on the ground—still with the scent of Huangquan.

"Who are you? Who are you really!" Luo Tian shouted, his voice echoing through the inn and startling many guests.

"Damn it, what are you shouting about? You disturbed my sleep. I was scared to death!"

"Who is it? Don't you want to live? If my impotence is your fault, you're responsible!" Voices of anger echoed. Figures emerged from the guest rooms.

Hell's strong-willed people were violent; if they didn't agree, they would fight. Luo Tian had disturbed their rest, so they naturally came out to check.

Luo Tian ignored their words and gazed around with golden eyes. He extended his spiritual sense, covering the entire inn to find who had followed him from Jiugui King City all the way to Wushuang City without being detected.

However, Luo Tian was soon disappointed. There were still no clues—only a pool of water on the ground.

"Everyone, sorry!" Luo Tian smiled lightly. He opened his Immortal King's domain and gazed at those approaching him. At the same time, he waved his hand, sending a batch of pills flying from his palm. Each person received one.

"Immortal King!"

"Pills!" Exclamations echoed as people's faces showed fear, gazing at Luo Tian. They hadn't thought to grab the pills in their hands immediately—after all, for Hell, pills were extremely scarce. Since Hell had attacked the Immortal realm, alchemists became targets for Hell's competition. Every alchemist was a treasure to Hell—either stolen or enticed. Thus, the status of alchemists in Hell was high; even old-generation Immortal Kings like Su Peng treated four or five-grade immortal pills with respect.

"Your voice is so strong!"

"You're truly an Immortal King. I feel energetic, as if it contains the Dao. Spring Fragrance Inn? Give me ten more!" People spoke, their attitude completely changed. They showed extreme respect for strength.

Luo Tian smiled inwardly and stepped into his room, then crushed the jade slip with a hand.

"Be careful of Luoshengmen!" Five big characters were imprinted in Luo Tian's mind, making his brows furrow again.

"What does that mean?" Luo Tian was confused. The person who had given him this message told him about Luoshengmen in the Ancestral God Mountain.

"Did I misunderstand? Was it two people?"

"Never mind. I'll see what Luoshengmen is like. If there's an Immortal King peak inside, then it's my misfortune!" Luo Tian muttered inwardly. He stood up and opened the door, stepping out of the inn toward Wushuang City's southern gate. As soon as he exited the city, he took advantage of the night and flew toward the Ancestral God Mountain.

Chapter 2644: Arrival

The Ancestral God Mountain had originally been a common dangerous place within Wu Hua Palace's territory. No one expected it to suddenly erupt, revealing the tomb of an ancient immortal.

At that moment, thousands of figures gathered outside the Ancestral God Mountain. The number kept increasing as people's faces showed concern.

"Previously, some had gone in together, but no one has come out yet!" People whispered among themselves, gazing at the black forest. Over the past few days, hundreds of people had entered the Ancestral God Mountain in groups, but none had returned.

Thus, the enthusiasm of people was greatly diminished. As time passed, many strong figures from Wu Hua Palace also appeared.
