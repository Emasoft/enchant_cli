„Wum…“ As the group walked, a series of combat sounds echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, causing them to halt and turn their gaze toward the distance.

“Someone is fighting. This is just a bridge, there’s nothing to fight over!” Fu Xingyue spoke lightly, her eyes glowing with silver light as she looked ahead.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet hues, his gaze piercing the depths of the long black bridge. His pupils narrowed slightly.

“Those are your brothers and the people they brought—they’re locked in a fierce battle!” Fu Xingyue said with admiration, addressing the group.

Through their vision, figures cloaked in black mist clashed relentlessly, each fighting with desperation. The entire black bridge trembled violently, its surface echoing with thunderous roars.

“Those people have been corrupted by demonic energy!” Luo Tian murmured, his expression darkening. He felt the sheer density of demonic aura here was far greater than where they stood now, as if two separate worlds.

“What do we do? Should we continue?” Fu Xingyue’s eyes narrowed, sensing the danger. She had no confidence in pushing through.

“Wait a while—let’s move when they’ve exhausted themselves!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze flickering. Though the group didn’t wish to be drawn in, the battlefield’s chaos spread toward them relentlessly, growing closer.

The thousand-zhang distance was too near for them; soon, a figure appeared in their line of sight.

„Ahh…“ The first to emerge was Qin He Feng, his body a whirlwind of black mist. His long sword danced wildly as he clashed against a True Immortal Peak disciple, overpowering the opponent with relentless strikes.

„Now!“ Luo Tian barked at Jiang Yuzhe and the others, leaping into action toward the battlefield. Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang followed closely, then Jiang Yuzhe and Sima Feiying. Jiang Huantian brought up the rear.

Luo Tian led the charge, his Dragon-Subduing Sword radiating terrifying killing intent as he slashed at Jiang YuLong.

„Pang…“ The black sword struck Jiang YuLong’s body, sending him sprawling with a gush of blood. Yet he pressed forward, his form wreathed in black mist.

„Wum…“ Two half-Immortal Kings appeared before them, their faces twisted with menace. Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang countered with radiant light, clashing against the foes.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s group broke through the battlefield. Jiang Huantian roared, his long sword deflecting the residual attacks.

„They’re gone!“ Luo Tian exhaled deeply, watching those who hadn’t pursued them. His gaze turned to the distance.

„The Demon God Pool lies ahead!“ Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s faces lit with excitement, their eyes fixed on the vast pool beyond a thousand zhang.

„Wum…“ But as Luo Tian’s group steadied themselves, serpentine black dragons erupted from the ground, coiling around them with unyielding force. A chilling aura sent a shiver through Luo Tian’s heart.

„Kill…“ Sima Feiying barely resisted before the black dragons invaded his body, his eyes swirling with darkness. He lunged at Luo Tian’s group with a punch.

Chapter 2275: Ascending to the Peak of True Immortal

Sima Feiying’s attack was swift, and Jiang Yuzhe was closest. Yet Jiang Yuzhe’s condition was poor; the cold demonic energy made him groan in pain, leaving no room to react. Luo Tian moved swiftly, grabbing Sima Feiying’s hand mid-strike. A dull thud echoed as Sima Feiying was repelled, but his madness remained. He lunged at Jiang Huantian instead.

„I told him not to push himself, but he insisted on coming!“ Fu Xingyue snapped, her golden spear blazing with radiant light as she struck Sima Feiying.

„Pang…“ Fu Xingyue, a half-Immortal King, swept her spear, sending Sima Feiying retreating dozens of zhang with a crack in his body.

„I can’t hold on much longer!“ Jiang Yuzhe’s face twisted in agony, the demonic energy eroding his form.

„I won’t last long either!“ Jiang Huantian’s eyes flickered with darkness, his gaze meeting Luo Tian’s three companions.

„We’ll have to seal you away…“ Luo Tian sighed, surprised by their weak resolve.

Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, radiant light erupting from his palms. A starlight rose, forming a vast palace that illuminated the dark space.

„This is Star River Mansion!“ Jiang Huantian’s face showed awe, as did Jiang Yuzhe’s.

Star River Mansion signified something profound—they hadn’t expected Ye Wudao to entrust such a symbol to Luo Tian.

„You two enter Star River Mansion and subdue Sima Feiying. We three will check the Demon God Pool!“ Luo Tian spoke softly, his palace radiating divine light to envelop Jiang Huantian, Jiang Yuzhe, and Sima Feiying. The mansion vanished, leaving Luo Tian, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xingyang to approach the vast black pool.

As for Jiang YuLong’s battle, Luo Tian had no interest in intervening. He glanced back; the chaos among Jiang YuLong’s group had already caused damage, with one True Immortal Peak disciple crushed by a half-Immortal King.

The chilling aura pulled Luo Tian back to reality, even for him. He focused intently.

The three moved cautiously toward the Demon God Pool, the cold aura intensifying until Luo Tian shivered. A wild urge to surrender and let demonic energy consume him surged in his mind.

After an hour, they finally reached the pool’s edge, gazing at its vastness.

The black water was as dark as ink, radiating an imposing aura that made Luo Tian’s face pale.

Though the water seemed calm, swirling black mist drifted above it, as if demons sought escape.

„Why is there so much left now?“
„And why was the demonic energy not this dense before? It’s impossible to descend!“ Fu Xingyue spoke, her voice heavy with concern. Though they had reached half-Immortal King status, the Demon God Pool still filled them with dread.

„It’s impossible! If we enter, even with strong wills, we’ll be corrupted. This demonic energy is beyond anything I’ve encountered.“
„The ancient Tianmo Sect must have been powerful to possess such a place. For demon cultivators, it’s an unparalleled paradise!“ Luo Tian spoke softly before pulling out his wine gourd. He poured the yellow spring water into the pool.

The water’s purifying power was immediate, spreading outward to cleanse the corrupted demon spring. Luo Tian frowned,心疼 at the waste of his precious resource.

„This water is a miracle—opposites repel each other!“ Fu Xingyang marveled, watching the mist rise from the pool.

The yellow spring’s effect was undeniable; the ink-black water began to lighten, its darkness fading.

„Half…“ Luo Tian’s heart ached, but seeing the demonic energy recede and the divine aura return, he forced himself to continue pouring.

Time passed; after an hour, the pool’s water cleared, exuding a misty aura.

„We must conserve it—there’s not much left!“ Luo Tian sighed, storing the gourd. His eyes gleamed at the purified demon spring.

As the pool was cleansed, the world’s colors dimmed slightly. Luo Tian glimpsed a yellow seal at the pool’s bottom, like an ancient ward.

„You go bathe in it; we’ll guard you!“ Fu Xingyang chuckled, addressing Luo Tian.

„Alright!“ Luo Tian nodded. His current need for strength was urgent, and this pool was the perfect solution.

„Plop…“ Without hesitation, Luo Tian leaped into the water, a wave of clarity washing over him. The yellow spring’s worth was undeniable.

„Wum…“ He activated his cultivation technique, knowing he had little time to refine the pool’s energy.

Luo Tian sank to the pool’s bottom, beginning to refine its power. Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang stood at the pool’s edge, exchanging a glance before watching the ongoing battle on the black bridge.

„He should reach True Immortal Peak soon!“ Fu Xingyue smiled.

„Pang…“ The black bridge echoed with thunderous clashes, figures clashing relentlessly. Time passed, and deaths occurred.

As the Demon God Pool was purified, the bridge’s demonic energy lessened. The battling Jiang YuLong group gradually regained clarity, though still locked in combat, they began resisting the demonic energy’s corruption.

„They seem to be waking up!“ Fu Xingyue frowned, observing the reduced chaos among Jiang YuLong’s group.

„But Luo Tian is nearly there!“ The two turned their gaze to Luo Tian, whose pool now held less than half its volume. His aura steadily rose.

Time passed; an hour elapsed, and Jiang YuLong’s group finally recovered from the demonic corruption. They sat panting heavily.

„Damn, someone died!“ Jiang YuLong’s body was battered as he scanned the bridge, blood splattered across its surface.

„Six dead!“ The group quickly regrouped, some faces grim, others relieved. Their earlier battle had been unconscious; if they’d fought with full strength, the deaths would’ve been far greater.

Yet soon, their attention turned to Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang standing a thousand zhang away, their gazes shifting.

„That pool’s water must be precious!“ Tu Shengsheng shouted, prompting greedy expressions.

„Hey, we purified the demonic energy! Don’t think of repaying us with betrayal!“ Fu Xingyue barked, her gaze scornful.

„Damn, there’s not much left!“ Jiang YuLong’s group ignored her and leapt toward the Demon God Pool.

„This path is blocked!“ As they moved, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang stood before them, their long spears barring the way.

„You two locals—what are you? Move aside!“ A half-Immortal King elder behind Jiang YuLong roared, his golden staff descending upon Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

„Luo Tian, it’s enough! We can’t hold out much longer!“ Fu Xingyue raised her arms, blocking the staff while shouting to Luo Tian.

„Good!“ Luo Tian opened his eyes; the pool was empty, and his aura had stabilized. His body’s golden-black figure grew full and complete.

„Damn, you took the opportunity! Give it back!“ Jiang YuLong and others’ eyes turned red. They could clearly sense Luo Tian’s aura nearing True Immortal Peak.

„Who dares?“ Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang stood before Luo Tian, their aura terrifying, eyes burning with battle intent.

„You two? Not enough!“ A elder stepped forward, sneering as he pointed at Fu Xingyue.

„Old fool, it’s you again!“ Fu Xingyue sneered, summoning a starlight hand to clash with his finger.

„Come out!“ Luo Tian waved his hand, releasing Jiang Yuzhe and Jiang Huantian. They had recovered fully, their initial tension evident.

„It’s enough! A final breakthrough to True Immortal Peak!“ Luo Tian’s eyes held coldness as he gazed at them, pulling out his wine gourd. He tilted it, swallowing countless pills. A surge of power erupted from his body, thunderous sounds echoing within him.

„Crack…“ As more pills were consumed, Luo Tian’s aura surged again, reaching True Immortal Peak. A wave of energy radiated from him, his robes fluttering, hair飞扬.

Chapter 2276: Unyielding Power

Luo Tian’s overwhelming aura caused Jiang YuLong’s group to pale, sensing his strength far surpassing theirs.

Not just Jiang YuLong, but even the half-Immortal Kings felt a severe threat from Luo Tian. A True Immortal Peak could overpower its peers; Jiang YuLong’s group felt their strength reduced by two or three tiers. This was the terror of a True Immortal Peak—anyone at this level would be weakened significantly.

„Combined with the Heaven-Devine Dao, no matter how many True Immortal Peaks there are, they’re all trash! Even a half-Immortal King I’d dare fight!“ Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with confidence, his inner monologue before turning to the others.

„Pang…“ Golden fingers clashed with starlight hands, Fu Xingyue retreating two steps. She watched the elder also retreat, her eyes scornful.

„Not much!“ Fu Xingyue sneered, glancing at the elder before adjusting her spear.

„That kid—was it you who schemed against us?“ Fu Xingyang sneered, his form flashing as he lunged at a youth with a bow behind him.

„You dare!“ Jiang Yutian’s face darkened, the elder behind him leaping forward with a blade of cold light, slicing at Fu Xingyang.

Starlight spear clashed against the blade, creating a thunderous sound that blocked Fu Xingyang. The youth seized the moment to draw three emerald arrows, their green light flickering as they shot toward Fu Xingyang.

„Peng peng peng…“ Three green lights, fast and precise, sealed all of Fu Xingyang’s escape routes.

Fu Xingyang frowned; he felt a threat from the arrows, realizing only two could be dodged, one would hit.

After shooting three arrows, the youth vanished from sight.

„His archery and concealment are unmatched—Spear Shooting Sect’s skills are unparalleled in the Central Three Heavens and Upper Three Heavens!“ Jiang Yutian smiled.

Others didn’t move, as Jiang Yuzhe, Jiang Huantian, and Sima Feiying hadn’t acted yet. Also, they hadn’t united; only Jiang Yufeng and Jiang YuLong were temporarily allied, but their true intentions remained unknown.

Time passed; aside from the half-Immortal King elder accompanying Jiang Yuhong clashing with Fu Xingyue, others watched from the sidelines.

Fu Xingyang held his spear before him, his other hand grasping虚空, bending slightly.

„Ping…“火星 rose from Fu Xingyang’s spear, and he caught an emerald arrow. The third shot aimed for his shoulder—this was the best outcome Fu Xingyang could think of.

„He wounded a half-Immortal King!“ People’s eyes turned serious, gazing at the youth behind Jiang Yutian.

„Even a half-Immortal King can’t dodge a cold arrow!“ People murmured.

As the green arrow pierced Fu Xingyang’s shoulder, a white hand appeared before him, grabbing the arrow.

„Wum…“ The white hand flipped, sending the arrow back at the same speed as the youth’s shot.

„Pup…“ More shocking was the arrow piercing space, revealing the youth’s form. His face showed disbelief as a blood hole appeared on his shoulder, blood gushing out.

„He found me?“ Jiang Yutian’s eyes flickered, glancing at Luo Tian. The youth’s concealment was known to be nearly impossible for a half-Immortal King to find.

As Jiang Yutian was stunned, Luo Tian moved. His feet struck the ground, a thunderous sound echoing as he appeared before the youth, grabbing his neck.

„Get out!“ The half-Immortal King elder roared again, his blade extending to slice at Luo Tian.

Black lightning surged; Dragon-Subduing Sword clashed with the blade, Luo Tian’s body flipping as the elder retreated two steps.

„Old fool!“ Fu Xingyang闪动, not giving the elder a chance to recover. His starlight spear radiated overwhelming light, charging again.

Luo Tian stepped forward, appearing beside the youth with the bow, grabbing his neck again.

„You…“ Jiang Yutian, nearby, looked at Luo Tian with a grim face. He felt Luo Tian’s immense aura and power, which made him unable to resist.

The youth turned pale, gazing at Luo Tian as if facing an insurmountable mountain.

„Pang…“ Luo Tian gripped the youth’s neck, a smile on his face as their eyes met.

„Do you think I’ll kill you?“ Luo Tian’s eyes held amusement, making the youth tremble violently.

„Luo Tian, stop!“ Jiang YuLong finally broke free from Luo Tian’s aura, his hand holding a golden sword as he slashed at Luo Tian’s arm.

„No threat!“ Luo Tian sneered, his hand emitting an invisible wave—eight directions of treasure retrieval.

„What’s happening?“ Jiang YuLong’s face changed, feeling a massive force on his sword.

The sword bent, sending Jiang YuLong stumbling back, his eyes filled with terror as he gazed at Luo Tian.

„Did I imagine it?“
„Did he touch Jiang YuLong’s supplement sword?“ People’s eyes widened, watching Luo Tian still gripping the youth’s neck.

„Cough cough…“ The youth coughed violently, his neck emitting a crackling sound. His legs kicked wildly, eyes rolling white.

„Pang…“ Luo Tian swung his hand, sending the youth flying into Jiang YuLong’s body.

„Cough cough…“ The youth gasped, his neck marked with a blood imprint, eyes filled with terror—his near-death experience.

„变态, too变态! True Immortal Peak is like a child to him. Who else can control him besides an Immortal King!“ Sima Feiying said, admiration in his voice.

„I might be able to suppress him slightly, but I can’t hold him! He might fight back and kill me. He’s not the same Luo Tian anymore—he’s grown too fast!“ Jiang Huantian sighed, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian waved his hand, several crystalline pills flew from his palm to Jiang Yuzhe.

„This is…“ Jiang Yuzhe’s eyes narrowed, gazing at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to purify the demonic energy in the pills so quickly.

„This is a beast’s pill—why is there no demonic energy?“ People’s faces showed surprise. They had beast pills too, planning to purify and refine them later, but hadn’t found a method.

„Jiang Xiong, these pills should be enough for your ascension!“ Luo Tian spoke softly. He felt Jiang Yuzhe’s cultivation was nearing True Immortal Peak, and he was willing to give this favor. After all, the better Jiang Yuzhe was, the better it was for him.

„Enough!“ Jiang Yuzhe gazed at Luo Tian deeply, saying nothing else before swallowing the pills and sitting cross-legged to refine them.

„Stop!“ Jiang Yuhong called out to the elder clashing with Fu Xingyue. The elder retreated to Jiang Yuhong’s side, his body marked with bruises. He had fought on the bridge earlier and was still affected by demonic energy, his strength slightly diminished.

„Come on, old fool! You said you’d fight ten of me—how come I can’t even handle one?“ Fu Xingyue spat blood, shouting at the elder.

„Luo Xiong, how did you purify the demonic energy in the pills?“ Jiang Yuhong smiled politely. He had seven demon pills; if purified, one pill was worth ten years of cultivation.

On the other side, Fu Xingyang and the elder stopped their clash, returning to Luo Tian’s front with cold eyes.

„Sorry, it’s a secret!“ Luo Tian shook his head lightly. He couldn’t tell others he had Yellow Spring Water. Seeing their intent, they clearly wanted to use him to purify the demon pills’ demonic energy. Even if he had enough Yellow Spring Water, he wouldn’t do a losing deal, even if they were the son of the Supplement Heaven Immortal.

This was the Spirit Ruin, a demon realm. If he helped them, it would definitely cause trouble. This was a competitive environment.

„Kid, don’t be ungrateful! I have six demon pills; purify them for me, and I’ll pay you some spirit crystals!“ A elder stepped forward, addressing Luo Tian.

„Luo Tian, hurry and purify the demonic energy! Otherwise, don’t blame us for being harsh! You guys are strong, but can you withstand our attacks?“ Jiang YuLong shouted, his voice filled with ferocity.

As Jiang YuLong’s words ended, the other brothers’ eyes brightened, exchanging silent signals. In an instant, they reached a consensus, planning to expel Luo Tian and Jiang Yuzhe from this demon realm.

„Wum…“ Before Jiang YuLong’s words finished, Luo Tian moved again, appearing beside him and punching.

„You can try!“ A thunderous punch,强势, made Jiang YuLong’s face pale instantly.

Chapter 2277: Tianmo Sect Ruins

„Pang…“ Luo Tian’s punch struck Jiang YuLong’s body, leaving him no chance to resist. His chest caved in, and he fell to the ground in a heap.

As Jiang YuLong tried to rise, Luo Tian’s form instantly appeared, his foot stomping on Jiang YuLong’s body. His eyes were cold as he watched the half-Immortal King elder accompanying Jiang YuLong.

„Don’t move!“ A cold voice echoed, freezing the elder in place. His eyes carried fear; Luo Tian’s attack had been too fast and unexpected, subduing Jiang YuLong.

„Who says to unite—attack them first!“ Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang sneered, appearing before the elder. Their words made the others hesitate, losing their desire to unite.

No one wanted to be the first to act; Jiang YuLong was the best example. The two elders accompanying Jiang YuLong also looked grim, as Jiang Yuzhe, Jiang Huantian, and Sima Feiying had surrounded them. Any move would invite attacks from the three.

Luo Tian’s group was clearly the strongest, capable of facing two groups. Naturally, no one wanted to confront them directly.

„Are you still planning to unite and suppress us?“ Luo Tian sneered, scanning the crowd. His foot pressed harder on Jiang YuLong, who spat blood continuously.

„Luo Xiong, what are you saying? We’re all from Supplement Heaven Mountain. Why be so tense? Let’s keep peace!“ Jiang Yuhong smiled, easing the awkwardness.

„You speak so nicely!“ Jiang Yutian sneered, making Jiang Yuhong’s face slightly awkward. The two had never gotten along well.

„Wum…“ As the group hesitated, the Demon God Pool’s bottom emitted a series of hums. The water sounds returned, and black demonic energy flowed out again, causing the crowd’s faces to shift.

„Again? What’s happening?“ Seeing the black demonic energy flowing, people were startled. Their recent experience with demonic corruption was still fresh.

„This time we’ll take it! We won’t fight over it!“ Fu Xingyue sneered, scanning the group. She wasn’t afraid of being corrupted.

„That seal—was it a demonic energy ward or an entrance to the world’s heart?“ Jiang Yufeng asked sharply, gazing at the seal being submerged by demonic water.

„Never mind—let’s fight! I don’t want to be corrupted again!“ Jiang Yuxian shouted, leaping toward the Demon God Pool. He reached the seal and tore it with his hands.

No one stopped Jiang Yuxian, as they didn’t know how to act.

The golden seal fell into Jiang Yuxian’s hands, then turned into points of gold light. As he tore the seal, a thunderous sound echoed, and a golden dot appeared at the pool’s bottom. Though small, it emitted an immense suction force.

Space twisted, the golden dot expanding into a golden vortex, hungrily absorbing the surging demonic energy.

Luo Tian’s group shifted slightly, also being sucked in by the force and vanishing into the black space.

The Demon God Pool disappeared, as did the bridge. With the suction force spreading, the altar where Luo Tian’s group stood began to fade. Through the altar’s suction, the demonic energy within the beasts was also extracted.

Even the world itself seemed to fade, with wild demonic energy rushing toward the broken seal of the altar.

„Roar…“ As demonic energy was extracted, the beasts regained normalcy, and a faint vitality returned to the earth. The beasts began moving from the altar toward all directions.

After the familiar disorientation, Luo Tian’s group landed on solid ground.

Upon landing, they quickly formed groups, gazing at each other. Yet a foul scent filled their perception.

Black mountains, black buildings—ruined but still retaining divine essence, leaving the group in awe.

„This is the Tianmo Sect!“ Jiang Yuzhe spoke softly, gazing ahead, causing a divine shock among the group.

„How do you know this is the Tianmo Sect? Did you have contact with its disciples before?“ Jiang Yutian asked coldly as Jiang Yuzhe’s words ended.

„Idiot, it’s written there!“ Fu Xingyue cursed, looking at Jiang Yutian as if he were a fool.

„You…“ Jiang Yutian was about to retort but saw the three bold characters on the black mountain gate.

„After my father destroyed the Tianmo Sect, I never found its mountain gate. Now it’s here—this means all of the Tianmo Sect’s resources are still intact!“ Jiang Yufeng shouted, her voice filled with excitement.

„Let’s go…“ Almost instantly, the group’s faces lit up, fearing they’d be too late as they rushed toward the Tianmo Sect’s mountain gate.

„Be careful…“ Luo Tian stopped Jiang Yuzhe and the others from moving. Though the Tianmo Sect was destroyed by Supplement Heaven Mountain, if it wasn’t fully eradicated and had remnants, there might be danger. Even without living beings, the Tianmo Sect itself was a treacherous place.

But Jiang YuLong’s group ignored this, rushing toward the four directions of the Tianmo Sect to search for resources.

The ancient Tianmo Sect dared to attack Supplement Heaven Mountain, so it had its own strength. Soon, thunderous sounds echoed as buildings were reduced to rubble.

„Haha, ten middle-tier divine artifacts!“
„This is a five-tier elixir!“ Shouts of excitement echoed. Besides Luo Tian’s six, others began looting, finding no world-shattering elixirs but plenty of resources.

The Tianmo Sect was vast, so they moved slowly toward the summit, sensing treasures awaited there.

Luo Tian’s group also took some resources casually, though they were trivial to them.

„Wum…“ As they neared the summit, a burning sensation rose on Luo Tian’s back. The heat came from his Dragon-Subduing Sword’s sheath.

Since Luo Tian mastered the second level of sword art, his Dragon-Subduing Sword had shown some recognition. It rarely emitted such vibrations, wanting to break free from the sheath.

„Return!“ Luo Tian spoke softly, his hands forming a seal to make the Dragon-Subduing Sword emit discontent and stop vibrating.

„What’s happening?“ Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his mind pondering. The Dragon-Subduing Sword’s strange reaction was no small matter.

„It’s likely encountered an ancient divine weapon, hence the Dragon-Subduing Sword’s reaction!“ Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with anticipation.

„Huh? Did you notice? It feels like someone was here before us!“ Fu Xingyue’s voice pulled Luo Tian back.

Fu Xingyue held an empty box, addressing the group: „This box clearly had a seal, but it was broken. The aura still lingers!“

Fu Xingyue waved his hand, a faint blood aura appearing in his palm—extremely weak, but Luo Tian’s group felt it.

„Did someone come here before us?“ Jiang Yuzhe frowned, his eyes turning serious.

„Be careful. Though the aura is weak, it might not be strong. If it’s not one person, we can’t be careless. I feel some evil energy here—perhaps there’ll be a great discovery. Your father treated you well!“ Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with admiration.

Luo Tian was certain their every move was under Supplement Heaven Immortal’s surveillance. The fact that this place had something to trigger the Dragon-Subduing Sword meant it was no ordinary place. Supplement Heaven Immortal had given this to Jiang Yuzhe’s group to compete over.

It was clear Supplement Heaven Immortal had meticulously prepared this, and their every action might have been calculated. They were following Supplement Heaven Immortal’s plan, as his Supplement Heaven Art was unparalleled in divination and calculation.

„What’s going on? Everything is empty—no treasures left at all!“ Jiang YuLong and others noticed something was wrong, shouting angrily.

„Someone must have come before us to this Tianmo Mountain! Who?“ Jiang YuLong’s face paled, his voice filled with anger. They all knew the higher they went up the mountain, the better treasures awaited—but now someone had taken them.

„Third brother—probably third brother! I never saw him since the beginning!“ Jiang Yutian spoke, thinking of Jiang Yu.

„It must be third brother… Damn, how did he get in!“ Jiang Yufeng’s group faces darkened, their anger deepening as they climbed hundreds of zhang toward the summit again, still finding nothing.

„They left us these scraps, but the treasures must have been taken by third brother! This is an entire Tianmo Sect’s treasure, better than the Demon God Pool!“ Other Jiang brothers spoke, their voices filled with anger.

„Let’s go…“ In an instant, people stopped lingering at the mountain base and rushed toward the Tianmo Mountain’s summit.

„Ah…“ On the summit, four figures walked, their eyes filled with excitement.

„Who’s talking about me?“
„Damn, who came before us to this Tianmo Mountain!“ A youth sneezed, cursing angrily. His voice was filled with fury.

„No matter who it is, give it back to me!“ The leading youth spoke coldly. It was none other than the long-absent Jiang Yu’s group.

Chapter 2278: The Gate of Life and Death
