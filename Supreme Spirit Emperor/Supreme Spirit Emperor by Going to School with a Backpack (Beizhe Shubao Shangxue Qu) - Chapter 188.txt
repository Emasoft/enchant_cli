"Thank you!" Gu Qianxue's eyes carried gratitude as she addressed Nan Gong Yuqing, her expression slightly brighter. She turned to look at Luo Tian in her arms, then her body stiffened. Her gaze held a flicker of wild joy, and her breath grew heavy.

"This..." Gu Qianxue was so moved she could not speak, her eyes filled with inquiry as they met Leng Qiuchan's.

Leng Qiuchan saw Gu Qianxue had returned to normal, her eyes filled with joy. When she noticed Gu Qianxue's gaze转向 herself, she naturally understood the question in Gu Qianxue's eyes. She nodded with emotion.

"Hum..." As people were still stirred, Luo Tian's mind suddenly radiated golden light. A faint shadow emerged from his spirit sea, appearing before the onlookers.

"Who are you?" The crowd's faces showed anger. The old man clearly resembled a soul state, and people feared he might be a powerful being lured by Luo Tian's body, attempting to possess him.

"Ha ha, don't be nervous. If it weren't for me, this kid would have died countless times already. You should thank me. Remember, to save this kid, you must use the Eternal Survival Array. There's no other way! Remember well!" After speaking, the shadow vanished from sight, re-entering Luo Tian's spirit sea. People were left puzzled.

"What is the Eternal Survival Array?" The crowd's faces showed confusion, exchanging glances without understanding what this array did.

Finally, the people of Tianyuan Continent turned their gazes to Jiang Nanxuan, as they believed his array mastery was the most profound among them.

However, Jiang Nanxuan's face showed a look of surprise. His eyes held disbelief as he murmured, "The Eternal Survival Array... I never thought such an array actually existed!"

"Senior Jiang, don't be so mysterious. Hurry up and explain what this Eternal Survival Array is!" Leng Qiuchan's face showed a hint of joy after hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words.

"The Eternal Survival Array is said to be the ancestor of array arts, created by Wan Chongwu. As for who this Wan Chongwu is, I don't know. I only saw it in an ancient book!" Jiang Nanxuan's face showed difficulty, shaking his head without providing useful information.

"Alas..." The people of Tianyuan Continent sighed collectively, their eyes filled with disappointment. It was a legendary figure; no one knew if he still lived or where to find him, nor whether the inheritance had been lost.

"What should we do? Who is this Wan Lingkong?" The people of Tianyuan Continent shouted, their eyes filled with anxiety.

"Perhaps I can know. This Wan Chongwu... but I need to go to Tiger Prison Star first. Wait for me here!" Nan Gong Yuqing's face showed a contemplative expression, not continuing to speak. His body vanished from the spot.

"Tiger Prison Star, yes! Tiger Prison Star!" Tu Hongfei and Li Tianzhi's faces showed smiles upon hearing Nan Gong Yuqing mention Tiger Prison Star, knowing he referred to the terrifying presence on Tiger Prison Star.

"Where is Tiger Prison Star?" The people of Tianyuan Continent showed confusion, wanting to know what place Tiger Prison Star was.

"Maybe there really is a way..." Jiang Sixi spoke to Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, her eyes filled with excitement. She had also heard of the old man at Tiger Prison Star.

"Alright, everyone disperse now. Return to your sects and improve your sects. I've found a way to save Luo Tian!" Luo Xiong spoke solemnly. Among these people, Luo Xiong was the one with the highest rank. Though worried about his grandson, he restrained his sorrow and organized the people of Tianyuan Continent.

Jiang Yimeng also gently wiped away tears from her eyes, beginning to organize the people of Tianyuan Sect and Star River Four Thieves.

At once, the entire Tianyuan Continent became orderly under the people's control. Various sects' people flew toward their respective sects.

Although Luo Tian's condition was poor, the Tianyuan Continent had ultimately been preserved. And since Luo Xiong said he had found a way to save Luo Tian, there was no need for people to continue causing trouble for the Luo family.

Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian, along with the people of Ice Island, did not leave but led their island's people toward Five Elements Sect.

As for the Tianyuan Sect's disciples, Jiang Yimeng led them back to the Eastern Peace Continent outside of Tianyuan Continent. Only a few followed Jiang Sixi and Luo Xiong back to Five Elements Sect.

Five Elements Sect had previously been reduced to ruins by Yang Huan, but for people who were not even界尊 (World-Transcendent) or至尊 (Supreme), it was no problem.

A torrent of chaotic energy flew from Luo Xiong's hands. The massive Five Elements Mountain instantly stood before the people, restoring it to its former state.

The crowd's eyes showed sighs. Looking at the familiar Five Elements Sect, they felt a sense of survival after disaster.

"Is this where he used to live?" Jiang Sixi's face showed tenderness. She followed Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan into a simple courtyard.

"Sorry, our previous attitude was somewhat harsh. Don't take it to heart!" Gu Qianxue placed Luo Tian on his former bed, forcing a smile. Her eyes flashed with bitterness as she looked at Jiang Sixi's slightly swollen belly.

"Can you tell us about what happened after he left Tianyuan Continent?" Leng Qiuchan also spoke with bitterness, her eyes filled with a hint of envy. She regretted not listening to Luo Xiong's advice back then, leaving a bit of bloodline for Luo Tian.

"Ha ha, the first time I met him was in a place called Black Rock Continent. At that time, he should have just left Tianyuan Continent with nowhere to go..." Jiang Sixi's eyes showed nostalgia. She recounted all she knew about Luo Tian to Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, as if lost in a beautiful memory.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan listened quietly, not interrupting Jiang Sixi. The room was filled only with Jiang Sixi's pleasant voice, continuously recounting Luo Tian's past.

...

Time flowed slowly. It had been five months since Luo Tian returned. After the crisis on Tianyuan Continent was resolved, the entire continent had undergone a complete transformation. Without the former seal, people's cultivation levels soared.

Whether it was because of the people's talent or other reasons,界尊 (World-Transcendent) level masters continuously emerged. Even more so, people like Gu Lei, Jiang Nanxuan, Zheng Xin, Xiu, and Tian Luo - those with exceptional talent - had entered the至尊 (Supreme) level. Though only one source Supreme, such a terrifying speed still left the people of Tianyuan Sect amazed.

Now, although it was still called Tianyuan Continent, its area had tripled. Under the combined efforts of the Supreme-level people from Tianyuan Sect and Star River Four Thieves, Eastern Peace Continent, Immortal Ancient Continent, and Tianyuan Continent were merged into one continent.

Five Elements Sect was now undeniably the master of Tianyuan Continent. Zhang Ziping, along with his younger brother Lei Yong and Ji Chen, had left Five Elements Sect to establish a new sect called the Heaven Dao Sect.

For Zhang Ziping's actions, Five Elements Sect people had no objections. They even split many disciples to follow Zhang Ziping, entering the previously desolate territory of Immortal Ancient Continent.

The people of Tianyuan Continent would never forget the sacrifices made by Zhang Daotian, Demon Lord, Xiang Tianming, and Yin Tianxiong. To commemorate them, the people of Tianyuan Continent built statues and temples for them, allowing commoners to worship.

As for another well-known hero, Luo Tian, a statue was also built. A mountain-like statue stood at the intersection of four regions. However, people knew Luo Tian had not died but was severely injured and unconscious, unknown when he would awaken.

Without the seal's constraints, more people from Tianyuan Continent ascended to the界尊 (World-Transcendent) level and left Tianyuan Continent, wandering through the Four Sacred Star Domains. These people constantly searched for Wan Chongwu's whereabouts.

At once, the name of Tianyuan Continent rose to prominence in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Yet no one dared to trouble this newly appeared Tianyuan Continent.

Not only Luo Tian, but even with Luo Tian unconscious, Nan Gong Yuqing's reputation and Jiang Sixi, a nine-source Supreme-level master, were enough to deter anyone. It was said that the current Tianyuan Continent was at its peak, and even Qinglong Sect people would be polite when encountering those from Tianyuan Continent. This made the people of Tianyuan Continent more aware of Luo Tian's power.

At this moment, the hero of Tianyuan Continent lay in his former home in Tianyuan City, his face pale. His entire body had only a faint spark of life. Three women and some young people constantly surrounded Luo Tian, whispering among themselves.

After staying in Five Elements Sect for a short time, Gu Qianxue and the others took Luo Tian back to his former home - where he had risen.

"Several months have passed. Why hasn't Nan Gong Yuqing returned yet?" Gu Lei spoke, still with his loud voice, his eyes filled with anxiety.

"You're too loud. Want to scare someone? What's the rush? Not just several months, but even ten or a hundred years, we can wait!" Gu Qianxue shouted back, glaring at Gu Lei.

"We shouldn't rely on one person. Now we are all Supreme-level masters. Let's start today to search for whether Wan Chongwu is still alive or if there are any descendants left!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, his eyes showing a hint of worry.

"I agree. We can't keep waiting forever. Our time is limited, and Jiang Sixi's child can't wait either. I hope Luo Tian will be the first to see his child!" Leng Qiuchan also nodded in agreement, looking at Jiang Sixi whose belly was already high.

After several months of coexistence, the three women had fully accepted each other. Jiang Sixi was also completely recognized by Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

After Leng Qiuchan's words, people instinctively turned their gaze to Jiang Sixi who was about to give birth. Their eyes showed tenderness, sensing a vigorous life growing within her. This child was Luo Tian's.

"Hum..." As people were discussing, the void over Tianyuan Continent tore open. Two figures appeared in the sky of Tianyuan Continent, looking somewhat battered - it was Nan Gong Yuqing who had been missing for several months. Beside him stood a young man in white.

"Chapter 863: Break and Rise"

Over Tianyuan Continent, two young men with battered appearances stood on the sky, their faces showing a sense of admiration.

"Sorry for making you wait!" Nan Gong Yuqing muttered, his face showing a smile. His powerful spiritual sense had already scanned the courtyard of Gu's family in Tianyuan City.

"South Palace, you risked your life to return to the Demon-Immortal Domain just to have me save this half-dead kid?" A young man in white showed a sigh, his pure white robe stained with blood. He slightly frowned.

"Yes, come on!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke softly and pulled the young man. Instantly, they appeared in the courtyard of Gu's family in Tianyuan City.

At this moment, Gu Qianxue and others were still discussing how to save Luo Tian. The two figures appeared like ghosts, causing people's hearts to jump and immediately becoming alert.

"South Palace!" Jiang Sixi showed a smile, her eyes filled with excitement as she looked at Nan Gong Yuqing.

Others saw Nan Gong Yuqing and showed a hint of joy. Although Gu Qianxue and others didn't know Nan Gong Yuqing, people remembered he had said before he was going to find someone who could save Luo Tian. Now that Nan Gong Yuqing had returned, it was naturally bringing news back. Their eyes showed expectation as they looked at Nan Gong Yuqing.

"Sorry, everyone. Master Wan Chongwu has already entered the state of 'sitting in meditation'..." Nan Gong Yuqing spoke softly, his eyes showing a hint of smile.

"Alas..." Upon hearing Nan Gong Yuqing's words, people's eyes instantly showed disappointment and sighed deeply.

"Don't worry. Although Master Wan Chongwu has entered the state of 'sitting in meditation', he does have a descendant!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, directing his gaze to the young man in white beside him.

"Hello, I am Wan Lingkong!" The young man in white slightly frowned. His voice carried a hint of laziness, wondering why Nan Gong Yuqing made friends with such weak people.

"Ha ha, I knew the elder would definitely be able to do it!" Ren Hongzhe laughed loudly.

"Please help us!" Everyone bowed respectfully to Wan Lingkong, their voices filled with deep gratitude.

"Ah, I'm doing this for Nan Gong Yuqing's sake. If it weren't for him saving me, I might still be being hunted in the Demon-Immortal Domain. It's just repaying a favor!" Wan Lingkong spoke softly, finally directing his gaze to Luo Tian who was lying there motionless.

"Ah? Interesting! I never thought he could survive like this. Hmm, it's truly a miracle. Today I've really seen something amazing!" Wan Lingkong showed a hint of interest, flying forward to Luo Tian. A torrent of original energy flowed from Wan Lingkong's hands into Luo Tian's body, his brows slightly furrowed.

"Hmm. If I'm not mistaken, this kid must have died once before, leaving only a fragment of his soul. Even his physical body was shattered, and he preserved his soul with his life flame. That's why he's alive now. This physical body was also reborn by a powerful being who dripped blood on him. It's truly a miracle that he's in this state now!" Wan Lingkong sighed longingly.

"Don't talk nonsense. Just tell me if you can save him!" After several months of coexistence, Nan Gong Yuqing and Wan Lingkong had become somewhat familiar. His face showed impatience, slapping Wan Lingkong's head.

"Hey, can't you stop hitting me? I'm really regretting helping you ascend to the Super-Immortal level!" Wan Lingkong's face showed anger, looking at Nan Gong Yuqing and muttering.

But seeing Nan Gong Yuqing's darkened face, Wan Lingkong knew Nan Gong Yuqing might have really lost his temper. He nodded quickly: "Yes, but it will take some time to prepare and requires some things!"

Before Wan Lingkong's words had finished, a long sigh echoed through the courtyard. Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Tian Luo surrounded Wan Lingkong immediately, their faces showing kindness as they spoke to him: "Brother, I feel we can become good friends. Ha ha! After you save Luo Tian, let's talk for three days and nights!"

"Get lost..." Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sixi each kicked the three talkative people far away. They bowed respectfully to Wan Lingkong: "Thank you for saving Luo Tian. Please tell us what you need, I'll have people prepare it right away. Even if we search the entire Four Sacred Star Domains, we'll find it!"

"Don't be nervous. They're all common things. I just didn't have anything when I was being chased before. A regular array master's set of things will do. Of course, the array flags must be good!" Wan Lingkong saw the three women and flashed a hint of admiration. He secretly sighed that this kid was really lucky, having Nan Gong Yuqing as a loyal friend and three beautiful women who were devoted to him. For a moment, Wan Lingkong really wanted to save Luo Tian and see what kind of person he was.

"Does this work?" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, handing his storage ring to Wan Lingkong's front, his voice filled with admiration.

"Hmm?" Wan Lingkong looked at Jiang Nanxuan, feeling a slight surprise in his heart.

Jiang Nanxuan always gave people a particularly calm impression, making them quiet down.

"I'm getting more curious. These people around this kid are weak, but their talent is quite remarkable. Their future prospects are definitely limitless!" Wan Lingkong sighed inwardly, placing his spiritual sense into Jiang Nanxuan's storage ring. His face changed again.

"Good, good. It seems you have a good understanding of arrays as well. When I set up the array, you can watch from the side. I believe it will be quite helpful for you!" Wan Lingkong spoke softly.

"Evacuate everyone within a hundred miles. Then, you can leave. I'll do my best. This Eternal Survival Array was created by my ancestor when he was injured, and he eventually became a saint. If lucky, this kid might also enter the Saint level!" Wan Lingkong's face showed a hint of pride, speaking softly. His eyes also showed a touch of sorrow.

Seeming to know why Wan Lingkong was sad, Nan Gong Yuqing lightly patted his shoulder and comforted: "Don't worry. One day, you'll definitely shine again with your ancestor's brilliance!"

"Maybe," Wan Lingkong lightly shook his head. As he spoke, everyone had moved the people within a hundred miles away from the courtyard. There was not even one living creature left within that area.

"Thank you!" Everyone bowed deeply to Wan Lingkong, their faces filled with gratitude. They appeared a hundred miles away, leaving only Jiang Nanxuan standing before Wan Lingkong.

"Alright, I'm starting now. Remember, if the array flags aren't enough, you need to quickly refine them!" Wan Lingkong spoke and flew into the sky over Tianyuan City.

"Hum..." A ripple spread out. A golden array flag appeared in Wan Lingkong's hand. At the moment he grasped the array flag, Wan Lingkong seemed to change completely. His eyes flashed with intense light. This person was calm and no longer showed his previous laziness.

Jiang Nanxuan didn't dare to be careless. He flew up and stood before Wan Lingkong, showing no anger at Wan Lingkong's previous commanding attitude.

He slightly closed his eyes. Wan Lingkong's entire body was surrounded by nine-colored original energy, and he gradually became quiet.

Jiang Nanxuan didn't care at all. He radiated a calm aura, standing beside Wan Lingkong without the slightest impatience.

After a quarter of an hour, Wan Lingkong slowly opened his eyes. A golden flame rose from his eyes. Wan Lingkong's body transformed into a streak of light, appearing at the farthest point within a hundred miles. His hands emitted bursts of firelight, and fire attribute original energy flowed into the golden array flag, which Wan Lingkong firmly inserted into the ground.

Then, Wan Lingkong instantly appeared at nine locations. At each place, an array flag with a type of original energy was inserted into the ground.

After completing this step, Wan Lingkong returned to above Luo Tian. His face showed a hint of joy. He reached out and crushed Jiang Nanxuan's storage ring, causing golden light to surge. The sky was filled with countless array flags, making people dizzy.

Jiang Nanxuan watched Wan Lingkong's actions and his calm face changed. His eyes also became respectful.

Jiang Nanxuan knew how many array flags were in his storage ring. It was all the array flags he had accumulated over the years, not ten thousand but several thousand.

"Nine thousand eight hundred and seven! Not enough. Refine it more, aiming for nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine!" A low voice came from Wan Lingkong. At the same time, his hands rapidly changed.

Original energy exploded violently. The entire sky seemed to rain golden droplets. Thousands of array flags flew in all directions, each carrying a bit of Wan Lingkong's original energy.

Jiang Nanxuan, who was refining array flags, had his eyes flash with intense light. His eyes showed a look of understanding and he accelerated the speed of refining array flags, sending out golden array flags one after another. The next moment, they were wrapped by Wan Lingkong's original energy and flew in all directions.

"One thousand... five thousand..." As time flowed slowly, when Jiang Nanxuan took a long breath and sent out the last array flag, the entire courtyard of Gu's family within a hundred miles was filled with nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight golden array flags.

"Go..." After finishing, Wan Lingkong was drenched in sweat. Obviously, this array had reached a terrifying level of original energy consumption.

"Chapter 864: Why Four?"

Wan Lingkong spoke and appeared with Jiang Nanxuan before the anxious Nan Gong Yuqing and Jiang Sixi. People's hearts were tense again.

"How is it?" Nan Gong Yuqing asked, looking at Wan Lingkong who was exhausted and pale.

Wan Lingkong held a golden array flag in his hand, his face showing seriousness. He didn't answer Nan Gong Yuqing's question but spoke solemnly: "Inject your Super-Immortal energy into it!"

Nan Gong Yuqing didn't speak. His super-immortal energy slowly gathered and was directly injected into the golden array flag, making it radiate with brilliant light.

Wan Lingkong's hands quickly changed again. He cast a series of original energy symbols, which eventually transformed into small tadpoles and attached to the golden array flags.

"Hum..." A ripple spread out. The golden array flag, radiating with golden light, flew from Wan Lingkong's hands and instantly appeared above Luo Tian who was lying on the bed.

Biting his finger, red blood flew from Wan Lingkong's hand and attached to the golden array flag floating in the sky.

"Using nine-source Supreme-level blood and super-immortal energy as a guide, Eternal Survival, Break and Rise!" A low voice came from Wan Lingkong.

After Wan Lingkong's words, the entire world darkened. Then golden light spread out. A series of golden array flags emitted colorful lights, colliding with the sky and finally gathering at the golden array flag in the sky. They transformed into a series of gray gas, eventually forming a gray dragon that flew into Luo Tian's body.

"It worked!" Wan Lingkong showed a hint of joy, collapsing to the ground with a joyful face.

Nan Gong Yuqing also collapsed to the ground with Wan Lingkong. At the moment the Eternal Survival Array was completed, Nan Gong Yuqing felt his super-immortal energy was instantly drained. His dan tian's black whirlpool also stopped rotating.

"Alright, the rest depends on his own fate. If nothing goes wrong, he should recover in seven days. Of course, since he was severely injured, it might take two more days!" Wan Lingkong spoke solemnly and sat on the ground to recover.

Others also showed a hint of joy, their eyes filled with anticipation as they waited for Luo Tian to wake up.

"Sixi, you're pregnant. Go rest first. I hope Luo Tian can see his child born!" Gu Qianxue's eyes showed a touch of tenderness as she spoke to Jiang Sixi, who had a large belly.

"Okay!" Jiang Sixi's eyes showed a hint of exhaustion. Now that Luo Tian seemed to have no major problems, she nodded slightly and walked away with Jiang Yimeng's accompaniment.

"One day... two days..." Time flowed slowly. Before long, it was the seventh day.

At the moment the sun rose on the seventh day, people sitting on the ground opened their eyes. Their faces showed a hint of anticipation as they waited for Luo Tian's recovery. At this moment, people could vaguely feel that the gray gas continuously striking Luo Tian within the array had restored his strong vitality.

However, people waited for a day but did not see Luo Tian recover. Instead, they received another message that cast a shadow over their hearts.

This message was brought by Jiang Yimeng. For these days, due to Jiang Sixi's approaching childbirth, the entire Tianyuan Sect was managed by Jiang Yimeng. All matters were first passed to Jiang Yimeng, and if she couldn't make a decision, it was told to Jiang Sixi.

"What should we do?" People heard Jiang Yimeng's account and showed heavy expressions.

It turned out that when Nan Gong Yuqing found Wan Lingkong, Wan Lingkong was imprisoned in the demon clan's prison. Nan Gong Yuqing had broken into the prison, rescued Wan Lingkong, and then escaped from the demon domain. On the way, they were chased by a super-immortal.

However, in the end, Nan Gong Yuqing had broken through to the super-immortal level with Wan Lingkong's help. He had wounded the pursuing super-immortal and escaped to Tianyuan Continent.

"Unexpectedly, the demon clan's reaction was so fast. If a super-immortal had been wounded, it would not be just one!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke solemnly, his voice filled with a hint of killing intent.

It was supposed to be the demon clan's prince, but now it was being chased by the demon clan.

"According to the disciple, three super-immortals should arrive tomorrow!" Jiang Yimeng's face showed anxiety as she spoke to everyone.

Super-immortal. At this moment, the people of Tianyuan Continent knew the power of super-immortals. Three super-immortals could completely crush the entire Tianyuan Continent. Even with Nan Gong Yuqing, a super-immortal, it was just a drop in the bucket. The gap was too large.

A repressive atmosphere spread among people, naturally directing their gaze to Luo Tian within the array.

It must be said that when Luo Tian was there, he seemed like a pillar for everyone. Now that Luo Tian hadn't come out yet, people looked at each other and didn't know what to do.

"I don't know who they're after. If it's after me and Wan Lingkong, it would be easy. We two just need to leave. But I guess we're only part of their goal. Don't forget the demon clan's ambitions aren't just limited to the demon domain!"

"Now that the demon clan is weak in the demon domain, it's easy to turn their eyes toward the weakest of the nine domains - the Four Sacred Star Domains. And Tianyuan Sect, which is at its peak, has naturally become their first target to conquer!" Nan Gong Yuqing's face showed a serious expression. His low voice made people's hearts sink again.

"What should we do? Our current strength can only withstand one super-immortal. The disciples can also withstand one super-immortal. What about the third? One super-immortal would be too easy to destroy Tianyuan Continent's foundation!" Gu Lei frowned, his eyes filled with hatred. He hated that time wasn't enough and Tianyuan Continent hadn't fully grown yet.

At once, people fell silent, unsure of what to do.

"Hey, don't worry. A day can accomplish a lot. Don't you know what I do? I'm not sure about anything else, but I can definitely hold out until Luo Tian recovers!" Wan Lingkong's lazy voice echoed, his words filled with endless confidence.

Hearing Wan Lingkong's words, people's eyes lit up. They had forgotten about this array master.

Although Wan Lingkong's strength was only nine-source, if given enough time to set up the array, the terrifying power of an array master would be revealed.

"Thank you!" People's eyes showed gratitude. This was the second time they had received help from Wan Lingkong.

"Alas... I have to endure again. But for my own life, it's better to try hard!" Wan Lingkong sighed longingly. His body flickered and vanished from people's sight. At the same time, golden light continuously flew out of Wan Lingkong's hands and appeared in various corners of Tianyuan Continent.

A day passed quickly. Under Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan's efforts, the entire Tianyuan Continent was surrounded by a gray barrier. Although it seemed like a simple array, Wan Lingkong was confident it could withstand three super-immortals' attacks for seven days. This was the terrifying power of arrays. Remember, at this moment, Wan Lingkong was only a nine-source Supreme-level master.

A day passed. People were disappointed that Luo Tian still showed no signs of movement. On the second evening, four old men in black robes with cold and ruthless expressions appeared outside of Tianyuan Continent.

At the same time that the four old men appeared outside of Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian in the Eternal Survival Array finally moved his fingers slightly. The sound of a powerful heartbeat echoed in people's ears, making their faces show a hint of joy. The gray gas continuously flowing into Luo Tian's body finally stopped, sinking down and appearing to clothe Luo Tian in a gray armor.

"Finally, there's movement!" People sighed deeply. They felt that the vitality in the array was at its peak.

"Boom..." But the next moment, a deep sound echoed throughout Tianyuan Continent. A shocking wave of energy spread from the golden barrier in the sky.

"Are they here?" Nan Gong Yuqing's eyes showed endless killing intent. He slowly drew his blood-red sword and looked at the domain beyond.

At this moment, Luo Tian's consciousness was slowly recovering. His eyes were still closed, but he could sense the presence of Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

"I'm not dead..." At the moment Luo Tian's consciousness recovered, he was filled with deep joy.

His gray soul energy slowly coalesced. A series of gray energies continuously flowed into Luo Tian's body. He could feel that he was just one step away from completing his soul, and it was even stronger than before when he was a super-immortal.

"Ha ha, I never thought this misfortune would make my soul strong enough to reach the early saint level. It's truly an unexpected joy. The Demon Domain! Wait for me. Since I'm not dead, my vow will definitely be fulfilled. It's just a matter of time!" Luo Tian whispered in his heart, looking forward to the moment when his soul would be completely complete.

In the Eternal Survival Array, it's not just Luo Tian's soul that was strong. As the gray gas flowed, his physical body also gradually strengthened, although it wasn't as obvious compared to his soul.

While Luo Tian was happy, people's faces outside were extremely serious. Everyone on Tianyuan Continent looked at the four old men in the void.

"Damn it, you said three but came four!" Wan Lingkong's face jumped high and he shouted at people.

"Chapter 865: He's Out!"

Tianyuan Continent was wrapped in a golden barrier, which seemed not strong but made the four old men outside Tianyuan Continent show a hint of seriousness.

"Indeed, this kid Wan Lingkong is amazing. I don't know how talented Master Wan Chongwu was in array arts back then, but Wan Lingkong is definitely the most talented array master I've seen in years!" One old man in black robes sighed, speaking softly. His three companions nodded in agreement, their eyes filled with admiration.

"Enough talk. Wu Xiong, remember your promise. I suppose the demon clan's credibility is still reliable!" One old man in gray robes spoke, his voice filled with greed. His dark eyes looked through the strong barrier at Wan Lingkong and Nan Gong Yuqing.

"Old bastard!" Wan Lingkong stood on the ground, cursing and showing anger at the four old men outside the void.

"Wan Lingkong, Nan Gong Yuqing, surrender quietly. This array can't stop us!" One old man spoke, his voice cold.

"Daydreaming. If you want to catch me, you need to see if you have the ability! I've prepared a big gift for you!" Wan Lingkong waved his hand, and a golden array flag appeared in his hand.

Although Wan Lingkong's words were arrogant, people felt a shadow. Three super-immortals had already made them desperate. Now with another one, the gap in strength was too large.

"Luo Tian, wake up quickly!" People instinctively turned their gaze to the array. Although his vitality was at its peak, Luo Tian still showed no signs of waking.

In people's eyes, the only way to solve this crisis was for Luo Tian to successfully break through to the early saint level. Then, the problem of these four old men would be solved naturally.

But at this moment, Luo Tian still showed no signs of movement. He seemed to be deep in sleep, completely unaware of the external crisis.

"What should we do? We must hold out until Luo Tian wakes up. That's the last chance!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, his voice filled with decisiveness.

"Yes!" Wan Lingkong lightly nodded. His hands radiated golden light, opening the array outside Tianyuan Continent.

"Old man, try this first. The Array of Destruction and Soul Devouring is open..." A cold voice echoed beneath the void, making the four super-immortal old men's eyes slightly narrow.

"Roar..." As Wan Lingkong's words finished, the array slowly moved. The golden barrier suddenly changed to gray. A series of gray long dragons rose into the sky, rushing toward the four old men with a roar.

"Since it's like this, we'll have to do it ourselves!" The leader of the black-robed old man showed a hint of ferocity. His powerful super-immortal energy instantly gathered, and with the other three, he rushed toward the gray array.
