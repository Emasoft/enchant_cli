“Fulfilling!” Luo Tian felt a surge of satisfaction. In the Spiritual Ghost Marsh, he had faced only aberrations; he had been relentlessly hunted and beaten, nearly making him question his very existence. Now that he had emerged, Luo Tian finally faced an opponent worthy of his strength; he was elated. “Monkey, why don’t you surrender quickly!” Luo Tian bellowed, raising his blade and charging at Yao Chen again. Yao Chen was about to strike again, but a surge of energy rose from the token on his waist, halting his movements. “This is not a place for fighting. Dare you come with me to another location? If you defeat me, I shall surrender!” Yao Chen shouted, his body flickering as he flew away. “What fear is there?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, sensing something amiss, but with his confidence, he leapt into the air and pursued Yao Chen. The forces of Hell were puzzled, unsure of what they were up to. “Is the Holy Son in danger?” Wang Gang’s gaze held doubt as he watched Luo Tian follow Yao Chen beyond the battlefield, his heart troubled. “He should be fine! They wouldn’t dare!” Wu Mian spoke solemnly. Their forces were stationed here; if anything happened to Luo Tian, Du Jianxing would go mad. Luo Tian was Du Jianxing’s disciple; the fury of an Immortal King in his late stage would be unbearable for Tianyuan Sect. “Monkey, where do you think you’re running?” Luo Tian brandished his bloodstained blade, chasing Yao Chen. The two raced through the battlefield, swiftly exiting tens of thousands of miles away. After an hour of flight, Yao Chen halted atop a mountain ten thousand zhang high, gripping his staff and gazing at Luo Tian with battle-fueled intensity. “Come on!” Yao Chen roared, but Luo Tian halted instead of rushing forward. “There’s danger,” Luo Tian frowned, scrutinizing Yao Chen atop the mountain, pondering whether to approach. “If there truly is danger, I’ll have no choice but to be ruthless!” Luo Tian mused, his eyes darkening as he lunged toward Yao Chen. In an instant, Luo Tian descended upon the mountain peak, his blade’s radiance exploding as he slashed at Yao Chen. “Monkey, you nearly ruined everything!” A playful voice echoed from the mountain as several figures materialized around Luo Tian, surrounding him. Long Jie, Run Hongyu, Chen Zhanbiao, Jiang Yuanxiong, two Shura warriors, and an elder of the late-stage Immortal King—ten people in total, each radiating formidable power. *Crack!* The blade’s energy shattered before Yao Chen, while Luo Tian’s expression turned grave. “So many of them?” Luo Tian muttered, cautiously observing Long Jie and the others. “Boy, come here!” Jiang Hongbin bellowed, his late-stage Immortal King’s pressure instantly crushing Luo Tian. “Despicable!” Luo Tian’s face darkened as he activated the Huangquan Step, planting his feet to escape. “World of Ten Thousand Blades!” Luo Tian roared, leaping into the air. Upon seeing Jiang Hongbin, he had already unfurled his domain, for the late-stage Immortal King’s pressure was unbearable. The gray domain instantly enveloped Luo Tian, swirling with blade-like energy; Jiang Hongbin’s pressure vanished as the domain shielded him. *Buzz…* Yet this time, Luo Tian found no ease in fleeing; Long Jie wielded a golden divine sword, slashing toward him and blocking his path. Luo Tian had no choice but to raise his bloodstained blade to parry Long Jie’s golden sword. Long Jie’s body recoiled, and Luo Tian took two steps back. “Elder Brother, we mean no harm!” As Luo Tian steadied himself, Chen Zhanbiao’s assault struck, his fist aimed directly at Luo Tian’s skull. “Get lost!” Luo Tian suddenly turned, striking with a punch that collided with Chen Zhanbiao’s fist. Meanwhile, Run Hongyu and others attacked as well; each strike was overwhelmingly powerful, launching toward Luo Tian. “Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye, open!” Luo Tian roared, his eyes blazing with golden light. He scanned the incoming attacks for weaknesses, rotating his bloodstained blade. *Boom! Boom! Boom!* The collision sounds echoed around Luo Tian, forcing his body to retreat repeatedly. *Puke…* Luo Tian was battered by their attacks; the strength of his opponents was overwhelming. Even with his prowess, he struggled to withstand their assault, suffering injuries after one round. Yet Luo Tian sensed they bore no intent to kill; their attacks were carefully restrained. As Luo Tian steadied himself, Jiang Hongbin—silent until now—finally moved. A gray hand swept downward, its immense pressure darkening the sky. *Boom!* The palm struck Luo Tian’s body, sending him crashing into the mountain beneath with the force of a fly. *Rumble…* The entire mountain was shattered, rocks flying and dust swirling; Luo Tian felt his head throb with pain, his body heavy. As he attempted to rise, a golden staff struck him on the back of the head, and his vision blurred as he gazed at those surrounding him. “Still not dizzy?” The group watched Luo Tian, who felt their figures swaying before his eyes. “Dizzy! Dizzy! Quick, administer the Recovery Soul Pill!” Long Jie shouted, instantly appearing before Luo Tian and placing a gray pill into his mouth. Chapter 2566: I’m Back! “This damned nonsense!” Luo Tian’s final thought was cursing; if these people had simply given him the Recovery Soul Pill, why fight? Yet Luo Tian ultimately fainted, unsure if it was due to the pill’s power or their blows; his head throbbed unbearably. “Is he truly unconscious?” As Luo Tian suffered, four figures emerged stealthily—Zhang Chenglong, Diao Dezhu, Sun Kienian, and Sima Tuo. They had refrained from attacking earlier, fearing Luo Tian might activate the Dao Heart Seeding Demon technique, which would have cost them dearly. “Unconscious! Come out!” Seeing their cautious demeanor, Long Jie and the others chuckled. “Damn it, this kid really causes trouble. Losing his memory led to so much chaos!” Zhang Chenglong cursed, kicking Luo Tian’s backside. “He deserved it! I was terrified!” Sun Kienian, Sima Tuo, and Diao Dezhu also cursed, repeatedly pounding Luo Tian to vent their frustration. Rarely had Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao intervened, as Luo Tian had truly infuriated them. “Tsk tsk, this kid must’ve acquired quite a lot,” Zhang Chenglong said, his hands moving swiftly as he performed the Empty Hand Technique, snatching a mid-grade divine artifact. “Tsk tsk, a thousand-year medicinal herb… high-level spiritual seals…” “I’ve seen these before,” one mused. “Ah! I remember now—Spiritual Ghost Marsh, this kid must’ve raided the corpse king’s lair!” Zhang Chenglong exclaimed, eyes alight with excitement as he continued to snatch treasures. “Old man, you’ve gone too far!” Sun Kienian cursed, while Sima Tuo repeatedly patted Luo Tian’s body. Sun Kienian and Diao Dezhu could only watch helplessly as Zhang Chenglong and Sima Tuo pocketed the treasures. “This bastard really has no manners!” Yao Chen and others muttered, watching the two pilfer happily. “Zhang Chenglong lacks any elder’s decorum!” They sighed inwardly, but the situation was resolved; they awaited Luo Tian’s full recovery. Luo Tian drifted in and out of consciousness, the excruciating pain preventing him from fully passing out. He felt powerful spiritual energy flooding his soul, strengthening it continuously while his body changed; he sensed an abnormal chill in his form. The scene flickered, leaving Luo Tian disoriented as if entering another realm. Time passed slowly; the gray spiritual light ceased to gather, and Luo Tian gradually regained awareness, his aura surging. *Boom! Boom! Boom!* The first change was Luo Tian’s dantian, as his cultivation technique automatically activated—The Mind Demon Classic. The ghostly energy within him transformed into a surging demonic aura. Demonic energy surged, expanding his eight ghostly meridians to gather into the dantian. The demonic aura settled in Luo Tian’s dantian, forming black demon thrones with intricate demonic patterns. “This kid’s power has grown!” Zhang Chenglong and the others immediately sensed Luo Tian’s transformation, their eyes alight with joy. “When he went to the Immortal Rebirth Mountain for revenge, he was at the late-stage Immortal King. Did his memory return along with his cultivation?” They mused, yet joy filled them regardless; Luo Tian’s strength had undeniably increased. “We must hurry! This kid is about to wake!” Zhang Chenglong and Sima Tuo quickened their pace. “Ah…” Luo Tian mentally screamed, feeling his strength steadily growing. As it did, more demon thrones formed in his dantian. Seven… eight… *Boom!* The sky darkened, black storm clouds gathering over the mountain peak. Thunder crackled within them. “Damn it! This kid’s already an Immortal King—why does he still have a thunder domain?” Zhang Chenglong’s face showed horror, immediately halting his actions. “Leave quickly!” The group didn’t hesitate, fleeing from Luo Tian’s vicinity, their gazes filled with concern. “Can he handle it?” They questioned, but there was no alternative; they could only watch Luo Tian. “Elder Brother, wake up! It’s time to eat!” Chen Zhanbiao shouted, his voice penetrating Luo Tian’s ears. “I wish I could!” Luo Tian mused bitterly; he had regained awareness, sensing what was happening outside. Yet his soul felt restrained as if by something, preventing him from moving a single muscle. *Crack!* As Luo Tian struggled to break free, a golden lightning bolt split the sky, striking him. Instantly, his body was electrified; the astonishing thunder energy surged into his body toward his dantian. “Is this to make me relive the thunder domain I missed during my amnesia?” Luo Tian mused bitterly, watching the lightning strike him. Though his skin was thick, the thunder was agonizing, especially as it etched into the demon thrones. One… ten… a hundred… In an instant, countless thunderbolts rained down from the sky, their colors vibrant and beautiful. Yet beneath this beauty lay an apocalyptic aura. “Is it truly safe? If he dies, better not to regain his memory!” The group inhaled sharply, watching Luo Tian engulfed by the thunderstorm. Time passed slowly; half an hour elapsed before the countless thunderbolts finally subsided. The area where Luo Tian had stood was now a wasteland, black smoke rising from the ground. At the center lay a charred humanoid figure. “Luo Tian!” The group cried, leaping forward to stand before the charred Luo Tian. *Cough! Cough!* A wisp of black smoke escaped Luo Tian’s mouth as he sat up, grinning and revealing his white teeth. “Brothers, I’m back!” Luo Tian spread his arms, embracing Long Jie nearby and laughing heartily. “Elder Brother!” The group surrounded Luo Tian, their eyes alight with excitement. “Luo Tian, you bastard! You beat us so well!” After some commotion, Diao Dezhu and the others cursed, though their eyes glistened with tears. Luo Tian shook his body, the black skin falling off as he donned a new set of clothes. His gaze carried apology toward Diao Dezhu and the others. “You bastards didn’t hold back either! Who hit me on the back of my head?” “I damned well wasn’t completely unconscious, I had awareness! Who kicked me?” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened as he scanned Diao Dezhu and the others. “Sima Tuo, you stole from me?” Luo Tian clenched his fists, moving swiftly to stand before Sima Tuo and grabbing him. “Mental loss compensation! Mental loss compensation!” Sima Tuo smiled nervously, no chance to escape. Diao Dezhu and Sun Kienian retreated behind Long Jie’s group. “No one gets away!” Luo Tian roared, slapping Sima Tuo to the ground. “Ah…” A scream echoed; after an hour, Sun Kienian, Diao Dezhu, and Sima Tuo lay on the ground, their heads bearing two large lumps as they begged for mercy. As for Zhang Chenglong, Luo Tian didn’t act; he was an elder after all, though eccentric. Respect was still due. “Kid, since you’ve recovered, think of a solution—what’s the situation? We don’t need to explain it, do we?” Jiang Yuanxiong smiled, though his heart marveled. “Hmm.” Luo Tian nodded, his face turning serious; the situation was indeed tricky, and he had no good solution. … Meanwhile, another battlefield erupted with a shocking battle—another gate of hell, the震门 (Zhenmen). Beyond ten million miles from Zhenmen stood another sect, Zhen Tian Sect. The mountain peaks were swarming with Hell forces. On the mountain peaks, disciples clashed fiercely, blood energy surging. A young figure with crimson eyes wielded a black greatsword, continuously slaying Hell ghosts. Behind him, two wings of yin and yang sliced through space, creating a storm that swept through the Hell ghosts. Zhou Li, a disciple of Immortal Rebirth Mountain and a direct student of Immortal Rebirth King, had recently risen to prominence. After his rise, he gained fame far and wide, especially during the defense of Zhenmen, where he achieved great feats. Zhou Li’s black greatsword and his wings were of significant origin; when Luo Tian ascended to Immortal Rebirth Mountain, he was killed by the Immortal Rebirth King, and his belongings fell into the mountain, later acquired by the king. Zhou Li had discovered Luo Tian’s identity and thus earned the Immortal Rebirth King’s favor, becoming a disciple to set an example for others. After being accepted, Immortal Rebirth Sect began to value Zhou Li, personally enhancing his strength; within a century, he reached the late-stage Immortal King. Moreover, they passed Luo Tian’s scattered items from Immortal Rebirth Mountain to Zhou Li. *Puff!* The black greatsword severed three Hell ghost cultivators; the strike sent tremors through Zhou Li’s hand. “What’s happening?” Zhou Li frowned, his control over Long Yuan (Dragon Origin) was unprecedented. “Luo Tian!” Zhou Li suddenly felt a tremor in his soul, sensing Long Yuan and the Fallen Heaven Wings’ resistance. “Kill him; I can truly obtain it!” Zhou Li’s eyes flashed madness, his aura turning wild. Chapter 2567: Ceasefire “Who are you? Why do you have Long Yuan!” As Zhou Li suppressed Long Yuan, a cold voice echoed in his ears. A sense of crisis gripped him; he immediately retreated and looked toward the source. Seeing the speaker, Zhou Li’s body froze—only four words filled his mind: Human Beauty! Light silk fluttered, like a blazing fire. Amidst the blood-stained earth and surrounding chaos, no one desired to kill this woman. Even soldiers on both sides hesitated. “One person can topple a city,” Zhou Li thought, recalling the phrase. He was no longer the timid youth but a disciple of Immortal Rebirth King, feeling the exhilaration of power. “This woman—I must possess her!” Zhou Li roared, leaping toward the woman with his greatsword. “You recognize this sword? If you come with me, it’ll be yours!” Zhou Li shouted. The woman’s eyes, already filled with killing intent, grew colder. “You seek death!” The woman coldly replied, raising her hand. A blood-colored dragon emerged from her palm, transforming into a serpentine form that clashed with the black greatsword. Using softness to overcome hardness, no thunderous collision sound erupted; the crimson silk wrapped around the greatsword, both locking in a stalemate. “Daozi (Disciple), that’s the Hell’s Seal Ghost King Su Dan. We’ve lost many brothers to her!” One of Zhou Li’s group spoke. “Su Dan?” Zhou Li’s face showed interest; the greatsword emitted a humming sound, its energy rising. The crimson silk wrapping the sword instantly shattered before Zhou Li. “You’ve taken what doesn’t belong to you!” Su Dan coldly replied; as a Seal Ghost King, she naturally came to the front lines. Due to her gender, she was assigned to the strongest Fenyang Palace of the Ten Hell Palaces. Fenyang Palace advanced swiftly, reaching ten million miles; previously they had rested, and since neither side’s main forces had engaged, Su Dan and Zhou Li hadn’t met. But today, Fenyang Palace decided on a full-scale attack; capturing Zhen Tian Sect would mean their entry into the Immortal Realm. Waiting for other palaces to fall, they would encircle the three days of the Immortal Realm. With this attack, Su Dan and her group naturally had to act; thus, she encountered Zhou Li with Long Yuan and the Fallen Heaven Wings—easily noticeable. Su Dan couldn’t fail to recognize Long Yuan; it was Luo Tian’s sword, and she knew Luo Tian’s situation. “This man is definitely an enemy of Luo Tian!” Su Dan was certain; the one holding Long Yuan had a massive grudge against Luo Tian. In Su Dan’s heart, Luo Tian was her child’s father, though she refused to admit it. Yet deep down, she accepted Luo Tian as her man. Su Dan’s sole thought was to reclaim what belonged to Luo Tian, so she confronted Zhou Li without hesitation. “Kill!” Zhou Li and Su Dan clashed again, charging toward each other with powerful fluctuations rising around them. Within a thousand zhang, no one dared approach. … Outside Tianlan Sect, two million people stared at each other in silence; neither side’s commander had issued orders. “It’s been an hour—why hasn’t this kid returned?” Yu Tian, known for his fiery temper, couldn’t wait. Others also showed concern; even Du Jianxing was so, his brow furrowed as he gazed toward Tianlan Sect. “He’s been gone a long time!” Wu Mian muttered, transmitting to Du Tianming. “What did you do to our Holy Son? If he doesn’t return in another hour, we’ll start the battle!” Du Tianming heard Wu Mian’s transmission and shouted toward Tianlan Sect. “This!” At this moment, only the Tianlan Sect leader was present; hearing the shout, he nearly urinated. “These ancestors, why haven’t they returned yet!” The Tianlan Sect leader anxiously sweated. Outside the battlefield, Luo Tian and his group were heading back. “Old Master Zhang, Sima Tuo—did you return what you stole from me? I’m poor; Hell’s resources are scarce!” Flying, Luo Tian addressed Zhang Chenglong and Sima Tuo. “Return? Why should I return it? I took it by skill!” Zhang Chenglong sneered, showing no intention to return. “Damn you! I wish I hadn’t regained my memory to beat this disrespectful old man!” Luo Tian felt like beating him. “Kid, if you’ve spoken up, I won’t refuse to give you something!” Zhang Chenglong waved his hand, handing a withered medicinal herb to Luo Tian. … Luo Tian and the group were speechless, staring at Zhang Chenglong; this herb was too low to even touch. “Little dog, is tomorrow when you hand over Luo Dezhu?” Zhang Chenglong sneered, making everyone realize. “Damn it, old bastard! What do you mean…” Diao Dezhu cursed, and the group bickered as they flew toward the battlefield. Since Luo Tian had disappeared, they had been压抑 (repressed) for too long; even bickering was rare. After flying less than an hour, they saw the opposing forces facing each other again. “Return!” Luo Tian addressed them, having indeed devised a plan. However, it was risky; he didn’t know how big the risk was but time was pressing, leaving no better options. “Brothers, our Holy Son must’ve been tricked! Prepare to kill these bastards!” As they spoke, a roar echoed in their ears, making their faces change slightly. “Bad!” In an instant, Luo Tian activated the Huangquan Step and flew toward the Hell side. “Stop! I’m back!” Luo Tian shouted, using a martial technique; his voice carried an eagle’s roar. “Stop!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Wu Mian raised his hand to halt the Hell forces. Luo Tian smiled on their behalf, standing before them with a powerful pressure that made Wang Gang and others feel heavy. “Late-stage Immortal King! He was gone for a while, but now he’s at late-stage Immortal King—this is too fast!” People hadn’t expected Luo Tian to break through so quickly. “I’ve recovered!” Luo Tian smiled, now knowing his strength; eight demon thrones in his dantian. If he gathered the ninth, he would reach late-stage Immortal King. Previously, he was at mid-stage Immortal King; if he hadn’t died, his fusion with the Reincarnation Immortality Body would have significantly boosted his strength. After dying, his cultivation dropped to early-stage Immortal King; he had been training and nearly reached mid-stage. Now, the Recovery Soul Pill restored not only his damaged soul but effectively merged both bodies; with his soul fully recovered, his strength had undeniably improved. “Congratulations on the Holy Son’s breakthrough!” Seeing Luo Tian reach late-stage Immortal King, the Reincarnation Sect was overjoyed. They knew that with the Ten Hell Palaces collectively enhancing the Holy Son’s strength, other palaces’ Holy Sons would also improve. If Luo Tian remained at early-stage Immortal King, he’d fall behind. “Let’s return!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Wu Mian. “There’s hope!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Wu Mian and the other high-ranking figures were delighted, instantly understanding Luo Tian’s intent. “Return to base!” Wu Mian issued the order; Hell forces began retreating, and Tianyuan Sect also withdrew toward Tianlan Sect. In the camp, Luo Tian and his group returned to the grand tent for discussion; all eyes were on Luo Tian since everything was negotiated by him, and only he could negotiate. “General, I need to return to the Reincarnation Sect for something; if I can retrieve it, our sect’s strength will surely surpass the Ten Palaces!” Luo Tian addressed Wu Mian. “Ensure the information isn’t leaked!” “Before I return, if I discover who leaked it, I won’t let them live!” Luo Tian gazed at the people in the camp, his voice carrying authority. This matter was too critical; if it spread to the Immortal Realm, Tianyuan Sect’s main base might face annihilation. “Good!” Du Jianxing nodded at Luo Tian, knowing how much Luo Tian valued Tianyuan Sect. “Good, everyone—stay strong; we don’t have much time. I’ll leave now!” Luo Tian instructed, leaping out of the camp toward Kanmen. “I hope it succeeds; if it does, our Reincarnation Sect’s strength will surge!” Du Jianxing and the others looked hopeful. Luo Tian flew out of the camp, his heart filled with admiration, unaware that two silent figures followed him. Luo Tian’s speed was astonishing; he reached Kanmen in three days, entering the Hell Realm. As soon as he entered ten thousand miles into Hell, he felt a surge of fluctuations behind him. “Someone!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed; the fluctuation was extremely subtle, and only with his heightened vigilance would he have noticed. *Buzz!* A bloodstained sword appeared in Luo Tian’s hand, and he turned sharply, slashing with a divine blade toward the fluctuation. The blade cleaved through the sky but struck no one; Luo Tian captured the fluctuations of two hidden figures. Golden patterns appeared in his eyes, and he seized the direction, his gaze surprised. Chapter 2568: Heavy Suspicion “Again you? No end?” Luo Tian frowned, drawing his bloodstained sword and gazing at the fluctuation. A black robe shimmered with moonlight, its dark hat and mist concealing his face; only two cold eyes were visible. Luo Tian recognized the attire, instantly understanding these two were from that faction like Shen Gongtu. “Momo!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief, gazing at one of the figures; his eyes were unique—one was a double pupil, the other like a full moon. This pair of eyes only Momo possessed; there was no duplication, as Jing Tian’s two eyes had one in Luo Tian and one with Momo. “Long time no see, Luo Tian!” The mist dissipated, revealing Momo’s face; his eyes gazed at Luo Tian without emotion, as if looking at a commoner. “Why are you mixed with these people?” “What happened to you? What about the Tortoise King’s City?” Luo Tian asked, his eyes filled with shock. “Nothing much; today I came to take you with us!” Momo spoke softly, his sword in his left hand. Luo Tian’s brow furrowed; he felt more confusion, gazing at Momo’s companion with his eyes glowing. “You’ve been identified; you know the consequences of returning!” The figure spoke. “Hmm.” “Get to work!” Momo nodded, speaking as he leapt into the air and charged toward Luo Tian. Blade flashes; in an instant, Momo’s blade was at Luo Tian’s head, his signature fast sword. Yet Luo Tian was no longer the same; his strength had grown by several times. At mid-stage Immortal King, Luo Tian felt no opponent; Momo’s sword was fast but couldn’t harm him. *Crack!* Luo Tian raised his bloodstained blade, clashing with Momo’s sword. Instantly, Momo was sent flying back, his eyes filled with shock. “Mid-stage Immortal King!” Momo gasped, surprised Luo Tian had reached mid-stage in such a short time. “What good is mid-stage Immortal King? We’ve killed plenty!” The other figure, accompanying Momo, held a long sword; his aura suddenly surged to mid-stage Immortal King. Luo Tian saw through the Thunder Yang Eye, recognizing this youth’s face—unfamiliar yet striking. Blades clashed; Luo Tian and the youth retreated two steps, both surprised by the other’s strength. “Ten Palaces’ Holy Son, nothing more!” The youth retreated several steps but his eyes gleamed with excitement, his voice filled with arrogance. “Who are you? Momo, what’s happening to you?” Luo Tian ignored the youth and gazed at Momo, sensing a massive change in him. “Nothing much; come with me!” Momo attacked again, his blade flashing rapidly, leaving afterimages. The collision sounds continued as Luo Tian parried their attacks without any disadvantage. “Momo is holding back!” As he fought, Luo Tian mused; though their relationship wasn’t deep, he knew Momo’s strongest was his right-hand sword. “Who is this youth?” Luo Tian turned, slashing at the youth with his bloodstained blade. “Ten Thousand Paths of Solitude!” With a thunderous roar, Luo Tian activated his technique, stepping through space to appear before the youth he had sent flying. He punched toward the youth. “Damn it!” The youth’s face paled, seeing Luo Tian’s punch; multiple fists radiated immense power. The pressure made the youth feel a life-threatening crisis—being hit would mean death or severe injury. “Previous Life!” The youth roared, his body radiating light; space twisted to resist Luo Tian’s punch. “Nothing can withstand absolute power, not even time!” Luo Tian sneered, eight fists combined with Ten Thousand Paths of Solitude—capable of destroying heaven and earth. *Boom!* A thunderous roar echoed in the sky, wild fluctuations even halting Momo’s movements; his eyes showed shock. At the same time, Momo’s twin pupils merged, emitting golden light that enveloped Luo Tian and the youth. *Crack!* The sound of breaking echoed; Luo Tian’s fist shattered time, striking the youth’s chest. The youth spat blood, his eyes filled with disbelief; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so strong. This punch nearly took half his life, and if he hadn’t used time manipulation, it would have killed him. “Present Life!” “Future Life!” The youth, struggling to stand, roared as he flew back, his voice filled with madness. Who was he? Though unknown in the Immortal and Hell Realms, his arrogance matched that of the Ten Palaces’ Holy Sons—perhaps even greater. “Three Lives Sword!” Golden light flowed through the youth’s long sword, a terrifying aura erupting. Luo Tian’s eyes finally showed interest. Yet it was only interest; Luo Tian smiled coldly: “Time Manipulation is impressive, but how does it compare to the Six Paths of Reincarnation?” A vortex of six paths appeared on Luo Tian’s fist, his unyielding body striking the youth’s sword. The next moment, golden light flickered; time energy was shattered by Luo Tian’s punch again. However, this time, Luo Tian’s arm bore three wounds; blood flowed continuously—this sword was no easy feat. “Good! You managed to injure me!” Luo Tian gazed at the youth, seeing his bewildered expression through the black mist. Yet despite shattering the sword’s energy, the golden light still surrounded Luo Tian, seemingly carrying mysterious power that attacked him. Luo Tian felt himself alternating between youth and old age; this force was terrifying. “At least it’s not too strong!” Luo Tian mused internally, his qi surging as he shook his body. The six paths of reincarnation energy spread throughout him, and the golden light was completely shattered before his face. “How is this possible!” Momo and the youth both gasped, staring at Luo Tian as if at a monster. Momo knew Luo Tian was strong but hadn’t expected him to be this strong. This youth’s strength, Momo knew well—mid-stage Immortal King, rarely challenged—but against Luo Tian, he was utterly defeated. “Ruo Sheng Seal!” The youth, unwilling to accept defeat, moved his hands swiftly; a green seal formed instantly, emitting a powerful pressure that immediately fell upon Luo Tian, making his face change.
