“Since it is so, I shall collect a little interest first—then I will kill you later!” Luo Tian coldly snorted. He knew he could not kill Mingyuan now. As he flew, his hand flashed with brilliant light; a golden Dao diagram rose from his palm, surging toward Mingyuan to suppress him.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram!” Luo Tian’s current power had surged dramatically. The might of the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram thus grew another level, its power equivalent to eight great continents, suppressing heaven and earth.

The golden divine diagram resembled a blazing sun, pressing toward Mingyuan. A terrifying pressure swept over the people of the Mingyu Domain.

“Powerful!” The people of Mingyu Domain wore solemn expressions, watching the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram descend upon them. Their eyes turned blood-red.

“Crack……” Beneath the crimson starry sky, golden divine lightning surged upward. In people’s sight, the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram clashed with the barriers erected by Mingyu Domain warriors.

“Boom…… Boom…… Boom……” At the moment of collision between the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram and Mingyu Domain’s barriers, a vast number of superhuman-level warriors from Mingyu Domain perished instantly, turning into clumps of bloody mist drifting in the starry void. Even early-stage Sage-level warriors spat blood, their faces pale with severe injuries.

“Kill him!” Mingyuan showed no sorrow for the dead around him. He spoke again, his hands emitting waves of gray sacred power, forming into several gray dragons that rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Kill!” The remaining warriors of Mingyu Domain showed no hesitation, their martial arts striking again. They formed a river of gray light, piercing through space and sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Another round?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, watching the overwhelming martial arts. He knew it was time to leave—though he could endure one attack, he could not survive another. But if he wanted to withstand it again, he would suffer heavy injuries.

“I wish to leave—what do you think I am? A fool?” Luo Tian spoke loudly, summoning his Shangtian Bow. He shot three arrows in succession toward the river of gray light.

Three streaks of brilliance pierced through space, carrying sharp and fierce energy. They plunged into the combined attacks of Mingyu Domain warriors.

Luo Tian sheathed his Shangtian Bow, his body flickering as he followed the three golden arrows into the river of martial arts.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram… Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist…” As he flew, Luo Tian continuously unleashed martial arts to counter the relentless attacks of Mingyu Domain.

“Boom…” After ten breaths, Luo Tian finally broke through the river of gray light and appeared in people’s sight. His face was pale.

“I won’t play with you anymore, Mingyuan. Wait for me—soon I will personally destroy all of you to mourn the souls of the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Luo Tian spoke fiercely, his Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram descending again. Taking advantage of the opening, he rushed toward the outer regions of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Damn it!” Seeing Luo Tian unleashing the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram again, Mingyu Domain warriors had no choice but to block it once more. Many perished in the process.

“Chase him!” Mingyuan’s face was grim, watching Luo Tian soar through the starry void. His eyes flashed with cruel intent.

At this moment, Mingyuan’s hatred for Luo Tian had reached its peak. Five Sage Peak-level warriors, two late-stage Sage-level warriors, countless superhuman-level fighters, and a large number of early-stage Sage-level warriors had all fallen to Luo Tian. With such heavy losses, if he let Luo Tian escape, Mingyuan would never be able to hold his head high in the Mingyu Domain again.

“Want to chase me? You still have a long way to go. Go back and train for a few more years!” Luo Tian heard Mingyuan’s scolding voice, his eyes flashing with mockery.

“Haha! Mingyuan, what's wrong? Did you get beaten in this small Four Sacred Star Domains?” Just as Luo Tian was gloating, several deep laughter voices echoed through the starry void. Their tones carried a domineering air.

Several gray figures strode forward from the starry void, instantly blocking Luo Tian’s path. His expression darkened.

“Two late-stage Sage-level warriors, eight Sage Peak-level warriors!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. Facing these ten people, his mind was filled with awe. Though it was only ten individuals, their formation was terrifying.

Two youths stood at the front of the eight Sage Peak-level warriors. They smiled, observing Luo Tian with their hands clasped.

Luo Tian’s mind shook as he gazed at these ten people. His shock at Mingyu Domain's strength deepened. Up to now, with these eight Sage Peak-level warriors, Mingyu Domain had already produced thirteen Sage Peak-level masters. Such terrifying strength could sweep through any sacred domain.

“Ming Li and Ming Hong, stop talking nonsense. You don’t know how dangerous this kid is!” As Luo Tian pondered, Mingyuan’s face was dark. Behind him, the entire Mingyu Domain army appeared behind Luo Tian. The two sides formed a surrounding formation, trapping Luo Tian in the center.

“Luo Tian, I told you—Mingyu Domain reigns over nine domains. You are destined to perish!” Mingyuan’s face was filled with resentment, his voice carrying an icy killing intent.

Luo Tian gazed at the surrounding people, thinking of a way to escape. Facing such terrifying formation, even if he had now reached Sage Peak-level, his chances were slim. Unless he entered the half-step Epoch stage, there was only a faint chance.

“I said I want to leave—none of you can stop me!” Luo Tian refused to let himself be killed. His body flickered, turning back and rushing toward Mingyuan and the Mingyu Domain army. He knew that against eight Sage Peak-level warriors, he had no chance at all. The only hope was to head toward Mingyuan—perhaps there was still a slight opportunity.

“Hmph, foolish dream!” Mingyuan’s face showed disdain. He stood still without moving, his eyes mocking Luo Tian.

“Kid, you can’t escape!” Ming Li and Ming Hong also showed mockery. They waved their hands toward the eight Sage Peak-level elders behind them.

Upon seeing their gestures, the eight Sage Peak-level warriors understood. Their bodies flickered and vanished before them, transforming into eight gray dragons that instantly sealed all of Luo Tian’s escape routes.

“Kid, die!” One Sage Peak-level warrior appeared beside Mingyuan. His hand swung out, a massive gray palm radiating infinite power, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He unleashed the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist, meeting the gray palm.

The starry void cracked. Invisible waves swept through it, causing Luo Tian’s robes to flutter. He stood like an undefeated war god, breaking the gray palm of the Sage Peak-level elder. His body paused, a streak of blood flowed from his mouth. Then he instantly appeared before Mingyuan.

“Sage Peak-level attack—yet it was shattered!” The two newcomers, Ming Li and Ming Hong, suddenly changed expressions. Their eyes showed shock. They had only heard of Luo Tian from others’ descriptions, and like Mingyuan at first, they hadn’t taken him seriously. But now, seeing Luo Tian’s bravery, their minds were filled with shock.

“Unexpectedly, the nine domains have such a prodigy! Comparable to the elder Ming Hun!” Ming Li’s deep voice carried killing intent as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“This kid must die. If he grows, it will bring great trouble to Mingyu Domain!” Ming Hong’s face was also solemn. He had marked Luo Tian as a must-kill target.

“Do you think I’m invisible?” Seeing Luo Tian rushing toward Mingyuan, the elder who had attacked him showed displeasure. The previous shattered palm had made him feel embarrassed. His eyes were dark, and he slowly gathered his hand again.

“Exactly—treat me as invisible!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. In an instant, he appeared before Mingyuan, his golden fist unhesitatingly rushing toward him.

Fanning Heaven’s attack—breaking all laws. Luo Tian had mastered it to the extreme, and a thunderous roar surged toward Mingyuan.

“Damn you!” Mingyuan’s face also showed madness. He felt a strong life-threatening danger on Luo Tian’s fist. He extended his hand, and a gray gourd flew from his palm. The gourd’s lid lifted, releasing waves of gray mist that roared with fury. A series of divine souls burst out from the gourd, as if guided by some force, forming into gray barriers in front of Mingyuan.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed no fear. His might-filled fist crashed into the gray barriers.

“Crack…” Thunderous sounds never ceased. Under Luo Tian’s unparalleled physical strength and the combined power of two great techniques, the gray barriers shattered like paper.

“Damn you!” The eight Sage Peak-level warriors showed madness. Their hands waved, rushing toward Luo Tian to suppress him and crack the starry void.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s fist broke through the barriers, crashing into Mingyuan. In people's shocked gaze, Mingyuan’s body shattered in the starry void.

Though Luo Tian had shattered Mingyuan, the eight Sage Peak-level attacks also arrived instantly, striking his back.

“Break through!” Luo Tian roared, his aura surging. At this critical moment, he chose to break through. He didn’t know if he could withstand the eight’s attack after breaking through, but he knew that without it, he would definitely die.

“Rippling waves…” A thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian’s dantian. The bloodstained starry void became even darker, as if the stars themselves dimmed.

Luo Tian’s aura surged instantly. A complete and perfect aura spread from his body, sacred power surging violently. The overwhelming aura made the Mingyu Domain people shocked.

“Breakthrough!” The eight Sage Peak-level warriors’ faces turned serious. They had not expected Luo Tian to break through at this moment.

“Crack…” As if breaking a barrier, a thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian’s dantian. Invisible waves spread from his body.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” At the moment Luo Tian instantly reached Sage Peak-level, the eight elders’ hands also arrived immediately, striking his back.

One strike, two strikes—each strike’s power was formidable enough to kill any late-stage Sage-level warrior. They struck Luo Tian, each making his body descend thousands of zhangs and pierce through several stars.

“Cough… Cough…” Luo Tian coughed blood. His cultivation had not yet stabilized after breaking through to Sage Peak-level, and he received such heavy blows. Even Luo Tian could not withstand it. His previous overwhelming aura gradually declined, seemingly on the verge of falling back to late-stage Sage-level.

“Stop it!” Luo Tian roared, throwing two sacred herbs into his mouth. These herbs resembled rare grasses, repairing Luo Tian’s injuries and stabilizing his cultivation.

With the two sacred herbs’ healing power, Luo Tian’s cultivation finally stabilized without further decline. His face remained pale, his body covered with fine cracks. The herbs’ power and strong blood qi rapidly repaired him.

“Troublesome!” The eight Sage Peak-level elders frowned slightly. They felt Luo Tian’s strength, which was no less than their own—perhaps even stronger.

“Seize the opportunity while he is wounded!” The eight elders, having lived for countless years and some even nearing their final days, knew that only by seizing Luo Tian’s current weakness could they possibly kill him.

“Kill!” The eight elders flickered their bodies, giving Luo Tian no chance to catch his breath or consolidate his cultivation. They rushed toward him.

“Let’s fight for a few more!” Luo Tian saw the eight rushing toward him. His face turned cold as he spoke, releasing an endless killing intent.

“Everyone! Retreat!” Ming Li and Ming Hong’s faces were grim. They ordered the Mingyu Domain army that had followed Mingyuan, knowing that a Sage Peak-level battle was beyond the capacity of these people.

Luo Tian fought against the eight elders, unafraid of their attacks. He unleashed the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist and the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram, fully prepared to exchange life for life. His unparalleled physical strength was his advantage.

“Damn you!” The eight elders’ hearts darkened. They continuously swung their hands, unleashing martial arts that roared toward Luo Tian. Though they could hit him and make him spit blood, he was like an indestructible monster—spitting blood for a long time but still not dying.

In contrast, after reaching Sage Peak-level, Luo Tian’s martial arts became even more astonishing. The Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram finally fully unleashed its complete power—nine great continents’ strength.

Sage Peak-level represented the perfection of the Sage realm. Many martial arts and powers doubled in strength. Luo Tian had achieved a qualitative leap.

“Boom… Boom…” A heavy pressure accompanied by powerful aura thundered downward. The Nine Heavens Diagram directly struck one elder’s back.

The elder spat blood, his eyes filled with intense shock. His face was pale as he was smashed into the void.

The other seven elders unleashed martial arts that roared. Seven different phenomena emerged from their hands, each one terrifyingly powerful. They rushed toward Luo Tian to suppress him.

The thunderous sound returned. Luo Tian’s body was surrounded by golden light, hit by the seven martial arts. He spat blood profusely and moved like lightning through his injuries, instantly appearing before the elder who had been previously wounded by the Nine Heavens Diagram. He punched him in the chest.

“Damn it, why is it me again!” The elder had just emerged from the void when he saw Luo Tian rushing toward him, ignoring the attacks of his seven companions.

“Crack…” The unfortunate elder had barely stepped out when he was struck back into the void by Luo Tian. Great Dao energy spread, his entire body shattered and entered the void.

But this time, the elder did not emerge from the void. Instead, his blood was continuously flowing out of the void, being refined into green smoke by the Great Dao energy and vanishing from people’s sight.

“A Sage Peak-level master has fallen!” Ming Li and Ming Hong showed shock. As the newly formed Mingyuan appeared, he saw a Sage Peak-level master’s death.

“Died… died…” Mingyuan was shocked. Previously, in the Broken God Cliff, Luo Tian had killed five Sage Peak-level masters. But at that time, it was due to the special environment of the Broken God Cliff.

Now, however, Luo Tian had done it with his true strength. Though he had reached Sage Peak-level, he was facing eight Sage Peak-level masters—each one a pillar of the sacred domains. A single Sage Peak-level master could establish a powerful sect.

“Unbelievable!” Though the Mingyu Domain people hated Luo Tian, they could not help but admire his incredible strength.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed. As people were astonished, the remaining seven Sage Peak-level masters’ attacks also struck Luo Tian’s back.

The powerful waves made Luo Tian feel as if he was only one step away from death. Blood uncontrollably spewed from his mouth, falling toward the starry void.

“This is your limit!” The seven Sage Peak-level elders’ faces were grim. They had surrounded one person, and yet Luo Tian had killed one of them—this was a great embarrassment.

“Mingyuan’s Sigh!” The seven elders simultaneously unleashed their power, forming gray Mingyuan shadows. They expelled endless gray sacred energy toward Luo Tian.

“This isn’t over yet!” Luo Tian’s eyes were slightly heavy. His body was uncontrollably falling toward the starry void, as if not his own. He continuously murmured.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian’s body became numb, a buzzing sound echoed from his dantian. A deep green flame spread from his dantian, carrying abundant vitality and spreading throughout Luo Tian’s body. It nourished his severely damaged meridians.

“Roar…” A low roar echoed. Golden light spread from Luo Tian’s body, radiating outward and illuminating the bloodstained starry void.

Chapter 1149: The Rise of the Splitting Heaven Spear ()

Under the starry void of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian fell toward the void with a pale face. Golden light radiated from his body, like a falling meteor.

“Bijin Lirui Fire, Splitting Heaven Spear!” Though severely injured, Luo Tian understood the sensation in his dantian. His face showed great joy. With Bijin Lirui Fire and the Splitting Heaven Spear, his combat power would rise again.

“Buzz…” A golden spear appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. His heart was excited. At this moment, he felt as if his hands held a true dragon. Divine light spread, but what made him most excited was the powerful Epoch power on the Splitting Heaven Spear. He was overjoyed.

“If there is enough material, maybe the Splitting Heaven Spear could reach the level of an Epoch Treasure!” If before, the ultimate of the Splitting Heaven Spear was a sacred weapon, then after merging with Mingyuan’s power, it had infinite possibilities. It had a chance to reach the level of an Epoch Treasure!” Luo Tian was overjoyed, gently touching the spear’s body. His face showed killing intent.

“Do you want to kill me?” Luo Tian, clad in golden armor like a war god, bathed in divine light. He gazed at the flood of gray Mingyuan shadows rushing toward him, his eyes filled with battle spirit.

“Buzz…” The Shangtian Bow fell into Luo Tian’s hand. The golden Splitting Heaven Spear was placed on the bow, their complex patterns intertwining and emitting brilliant gold light.

The sound of competition echoed. The golden Splitting Heaven Spear, under the Shangtian Bow’s enhancement, buzzed and became a golden dragon. It tore through space, rushing toward the gray flood.

“Boom… Boom…” In an instant, the golden dragon collided with the gray flood. A powerful tearing force instantly split the flood. From a distance, it seemed as if the martial arts of seven Sage Peak-level masters had been directly torn apart.

“Roar…” The roar echoed. Luo Tian stepped on the幽冥鬼步 (Yao Ming Ghost Step), following the Splitting Heaven Spear. In an instant, he appeared before one elder and punched him.

“Crack…” The Sage Peak-level elder had no time to react. He was struck in the chest by Luo Tian, who moved like a ghost. His face showed disbelief as blood uncontrollably spewed from his mouth.

“Buzz…” The Splitting Heaven Spear returned to Luo Tian’s hand. A golden spear image appeared before him.

“Fengyun Martial Arts!” This martial art had not been used by Luo Tian since he stopped using the Splitting Heaven Spear. Now, after his breakthrough, he activated it on the enhanced Splitting Heaven Spear.

Golden storms were unleashed in Luo Tian’s hands. Countless spear images instantly surrounded the severely wounded Sage Peak-level elder, causing him to be annihilated in an instant.

“Damn you!” The remaining six elders showed shock. Luo Tian’s speed was too fast; even Sage Peak-level masters of the same level had no chance against him.

“How strong is he? He just reached Sage Peak-level!” The remaining six elders continuously cried out, regrouping.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram!” Luo Tian took no advantage of the situation. He raised his hand, unleashing the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram toward the remaining six elders. At the same time, his severely wounded body showed no fear and rushed toward them. He held the spear in one hand and stabbed at an elder.

“Die!” The six Sage Peak-level elders saw Luo Tian not respecting them. Their faces also showed madness.

“Mingyuan’s Seal… Mingyuan’s Three Thousand…” A series of martial arts rushed toward Luo Tian, their power overwhelming. The immense pressure blocked Luo Tian’s seemingly invincible body.

The spear soared through the sky, dominating heaven and earth. Luo Tian shot a spear, unleashing the Splitting Heaven Spear’s martial arts. The spear dominated heaven and earth combined with Luo Tian’s Yao Ming Ghost Step, instantly appearing in the void.

“Boom… Boom…” The six Sage Peak-level elders showed cruel expressions. They controlled their martial arts, striking into the void. However, they soon became shocked as they found that they could not locate Luo Tian’s position.

In the next moment, a glint of coldness appeared. Luo Tian emerged from the void behind the six elders with the Splitting Heaven Spear. The golden spear’s golden patterns continuously flowed, and the梵天攻杀术 (Fanning Heaven’s Attack) was enhanced on the spear. Its boundless power instantly pierced into one elder’s back.

“Crack…” The tearing force instantly shattered the elder, vanishing from people’s sight.

“Retreat! That kid's spear is too sinister!” The five remaining Sage Peak-level elders were moved. Their faces finally showed fear.

Blood energy spread. Luo Tian panted heavily, the blood of the elder he had torn apart being absorbed into the spear. The spear radiated red light.

“Mingyuan’s aura—his spear has merged with Mingyuan!” The remaining five Sage Peak-level elders finally realized the truth. Their faces trembled.

“Hence, even we could not resist!” The other four finally understood.

“That’s my Mingyuan!” Mingyuan’s face was grim. Mingyuan was a unique item of the nine sons of Mingyu Domain. He had previously dropped his Mingyuan on the Broken God Cliff. Now, Luo Tian used it—so where did Luo Tian’s Mingyuan come from? It was clear.

“Mingyuan, you have already used your Mingyuan but still couldn’t kill him!” Ming Li and Ming Hong also felt shocked. Their hands held Mingyuan, so they knew its power.

“Not good. If this continues, the remaining five Sage Peak-level masters will also be killed by this kid! You two use Mingyuan to kill him!” Mingyuan’s face showed tension. He ordered Ming Li and Ming Hong, his voice filled with strong killing intent.

“Please let the two young masters summon Mingyuan to kill this kid! That spear, we cannot resist!” The five Sage Peak-level elders transmitted their thoughts to Ming Li and Ming Hong. Their voices carried urgency because this killer was coming toward them again with the Splitting Heaven Spear.

Ming Li and Ming Hong’s faces were grim. Mingyuan was their life-saving item, and they did not want to use it unless absolutely necessary.

But the matter of the Epoch Book was crucial. Sage Peak-level masters were vital to Mingyu Domain, and they could not watch Luo Tian kill their Sage Peak-level masters one by one. If they did nothing, the nine great powers of Mingyu Domain would not easily forgive them.

Meanwhile, the people of Mingyu Domain stared at Luo Tian like a god. They had not expected that the one who was previously chased like a lost dog would become so terrifying, killing three Sage Peak-level masters of Mingyu Domain in an instant.

“Kill!” Ming Li and Ming Hong looked at the overwhelming Luo Tian. They bit their lips, waved their hands, and two blood-colored Mingyuans appeared before them. Blood energy surged, and a series of yin spirits roared out.

“Die!” The two blood-colored Mingyuans, under the control of Ming Li and Ming Hong, instantly vanished from people’s sight. It seemed they had locked onto Luo Tian.

“Danger!” At the moment the two summoned Mingyuans, Luo Tian felt a strong sense of danger. His eyes flashed with purple light. He saw two red glows piercing through the starry void, vanishing into the bloodstained sky. If one did not look closely, it would be hard to notice the two Mingyuans.

“Mingyuan!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. He had seen Mingyuan’s power before. On the Broken God Cliff, Mingyuan had killed a divine consciousness comparable to an early Epoch power. He was no match for Mingyuan.

“Run!” Luo Tian did not hesitate. Having killed three Sage Peak-level masters, he was satisfied. His body flickered and tore through space. He stepped on the Yao Ming Ghost Step, taking one step into the void.

“You can’t escape. Mingyuan does not drink the blood of its enemies without a fight! This is a must-kill strike. Even early Epoch power masters could not escape!” Ming Li and Ming Hong’s faces were cold as they watched Luo Tian enter the void. They spoke coldly.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian walked through the gray void, guided by his identity token. He could feel Jiang Nanxuan’s position constantly drifting through the void. This action was only possible for Luo Tian, whose body was strong enough to dare such a thing in the void filled with danger.

“Buzz…” But in the next moment, two Mingyuans appeared like leeches on Luo Tian’s back as he flew through the void. They were getting closer and closer.

“Run! I must run!” Luo Tian’s heart was determined. He used all his strength, even burning his blood to increase his speed. He rushed through the void.

“Luo Tian!” Jiang Nanxuan seemed to sense Luo Tian’s danger. His anxious voice passed through the identity token into Luo Tian’s body. At the same time, a thunderous sound echoed from afar toward Luo Tian.

“Three hundred li!” Luo Tian estimated the distance between himself and Jiang Nanxuan. His heart was anxious. Three hundred li, for Luo Tian now, would take ten breaths.

But at this moment, the two Mingyuans were like two grim reapers chasing him. They would catch up within five breaths.

“Ah…” Luo Tian roared, burning his blood. His entire body boiled over and rushed toward Jiang Nanxuan.

“Stay strong!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face also showed anxiety. His head was crowned with the ancient Tian Palace, which radiated ten thousand light beams, covering Jiang Nanxuan. He rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Fight!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face showed determination. He took a step, and the petals of the Tianhuan Divine Demon Flower buzzed out, plunging into the ancient Tian Palace.

“Boom… Boom…” Black and white energy surrounded the ancient Tian Palace, increasing its speed. Jiang Nanxuan launched it toward Luo Tian’s direction.

Chapter 1150: Entering the Inferno ()

In the starry void of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian’s face was grim as he rushed through space. His body endured the violent spatial turbulence, his speed reaching its peak.

Meanwhile, two blood-colored streaks followed Luo Tian like leeches. They were about to pierce into his body, with countless yin spirits roaring toward him. Luo Tian could even feel the cold breath behind him, making his hair stand on end.

“Buzz…” Golden light flickered. Under the efforts of Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan, just as the blood-colored Mingyuans were about to touch Luo Tian, a strange ancient Tian Palace radiated fierce Epoch power and appeared above Luo Tian’s head.

Light spread, instantly covering Luo Tian. He sighed in relief, gazing at the ancient Tian Palace like a master above him. He knew he had been saved.

“Crack…” Two thunderous sounds echoed. The blood-colored Mingyuans pierced into the golden light screen, causing a powerful wave to sweep over Luo Tian. His face turned pale.

“Roar…” The gray divine souls were incredibly powerful, instantly wrapping the entire ancient Tian Palace and biting at the golden barrier that protected Luo Tian.

“Ten… a thousand… ten thousand…” Countless yin spirits wrapped the ancient Tian Palace tightly, making Jiang Nanxuan feel a chill on his scalp.

“Now you cannot harm me!” Luo Tian stood in the golden light, showing no concern for the gray yin spirits. Clearly confident in the ancient Tian Palace, it was an Epoch Treasure crafted by the Epoch Master Meng Lingyun.

Though Mingyuans were also made by an Epoch Master, they were still far behind the ancient Tian Palace.

“Send you to rebirth!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a hint of smile. He transformed into a golden key and plunged into the ancient Tian Palace.

“Buzz…” Golden light surged, illuminating the entire void. The ultimate purification power spread from the ancient Tian Palace, instantly sweeping over the countless yin spirits.

“Annihilation…” The true Epoch power combined with the ultimate refining power spread from the ancient Tian Palace. In an instant, those powerful yin spirits were completely annihilated and vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Regrettable, even as a Sage Peak-level master, I cannot fully activate the ancient Tian Palace. An Epoch Treasure is not capable of unleashing its true power unless it is controlled by an Epoch Master!” Luo Tian’s face showed a sigh. His eyes carried anticipation. He was a Sage Peak-level master, and the ancient Tian Palace had such powerful strength. If an actual Epoch Master controlled it, what would that be like?

“Spit…” Outside the void, Ming Li and Ming Hong’s faces were grim. They spat out blood, their eyes filled with strong shock.

“What's going on? Why did the yin spirits of Mingyuans get destroyed, and all the souls inside were gone!” Ming Li spoke softly, his voice filled with shock.

Ming Hong naturally felt the same. He exchanged a glance with Ming Li and quickly communicated with Mingyuans, fearing something unexpected.

“Buzz…” The blood-colored Mingyuans were pulled by their summoning intent, transforming into two red glows. They broke free from the ancient Tian Palace’s overwhelming power and vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

Luo Tian stood pale under the ancient Tian Palace, not stopping the Mingyuans from leaving. He knew that if he pushed Ming Li and Ming Hong too hard, summoning an Epoch Master’s projection would be a risk. He was unsure if he could withstand it with the ancient Tian Palace, as his remaining sacred power had been drained.

“Luo Tian!” Jiang Nanxuan appeared beside Luo Tian. His face was also pale, gazing at Luo Tian with a hint of joy in his eyes. However, he sighed deeply.

“Jiang Xiong, are you alright?” Luo Tian quickly enclosed Jiang Nanxuan in the ancient Tian Palace’s barrier. His face showed concern. Seeing Jiang Nanxuan’s pale face and the thunderous speed of the ancient Tian Palace, he knew Jiang Nanxuan had also paid a heavy price. Especially when he saw the black and white energy surrounding the ancient Tian Palace, emitting the aura of an immortal herb, his worry deepened.

“Nothing serious. No matter what, it’s safe now! This is not the place for idle talk. Let us return to the Fire Domain first!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly.

“Hmph.” Luo Tian pointed his finger, taking Jiang Nanxuan under the ancient Tian Palace and traveling through space. He found a direction and rushed toward the Fire Domain.

“The remaining people of the Four Sacred Star Domains have all been absorbed into the ancient Tian Palace. However, we were too late. The Four Sacred Star Domains now only have about one hundred million ordinary people left. This is because these people are in a remote continent with fewer inhabitants; otherwise, it would be even fewer!” As they walked, Jiang Nanxuan explained his situation to Luo Tian.

With Luo Tian’s distraction, Mingyuan and the entire Mingyu Domain army chased after him. Jiang Nanxuan’s progress was smooth. Even when encountering some Mingyu Domain people, they were all killed by Jiang Nanxuan’s attack.

“One hundred million…” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a melancholic expression. One hundred million people seemed many, but compared to the vast Four Sacred Star Domains, it was still too few—like a single hair among nine oxen.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian pointed his finger, inserting the petals of the Tianhuan Divine Demon Flower Jiang Nanxuan had given him into his body. Though the journey was dangerous, Luo Tian did not use this immortal herb because he knew it was crucial for Jiang Nanxuan. He had no intention of using it.

The petals of the Divine Demon Flower entered Jiang Nanxuan’s body, instantly improving his complexion. He had already used four petals to activate the ancient Tian Palace, severely damaging his foundation. Now, this petal allowed Jiang Nanxuan to recover significantly.

“Buzz…” As they spoke, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan felt a wave of intense heat. Red flames pierced through space, appearing in their sight.

“This is the endless inferno—Fire Domain’s death zone!” Luo Tian felt the familiar heat and showed shock.

“Unexpectedly, those flames are so terrifying they can reach here!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face also showed shock. He gazed at the inferno before them and spoke softly.

“We should leave first.” Luo Tian had once been a reckless youth, rushing into the inferno. Now knowing it was Fire Domain’s death zone, he dared not act recklessly. He chose to fly out of the void first.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian sheathed the ancient Tian Palace and grabbed space, appearing in the starry void with Jiang Nanxuan.

At this moment, they were still under the starry void of the Four Sacred Star Domains but at its edge. The thick blood energy could not be bold here, as the terrifying temperature evaporated it.

“Terrifying!” Luo Tian’s face was somewhat grim. He gazed at the inferno, his eyes filled with contemplation.

“If we want to return to the correct entrance of the Fire Domain, we have to go back a long distance. We might encounter Mingyu Domain people. However, this inferno gives me a strong sense of danger!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice filled with deep caution.
