“Eastern Blue Dragon Sword!” Wu Qingtian roared, slashing downward. The sky filled with a swirling green dragon radiating draconic power as it lunged at Luo Tian.

“Earth-grade Initial Stage?” Luo Tian chuckled, his body resonating with roaring dragon cries. His spear slightly moved, and golden serpents danced through the sky.

The thunderous clash echoed into the heavens as a golden and green dragon clashed, their roars intertwining.

“Not enough!” Wu Qingtian sneered, his Eastern Blue Dragon Sword flying from his hand, transforming into a green meteor streaking toward Luo Tian.

“Thousand zhang… hundred zhang…” The Eastern Blue Dragon Sword materialized a hundred zhang away, emitting a piercing hum.

“Let it explode…” Wu Qingtian was utterly mad, his heart feeling as if bleeding.

This Eastern Blue Dragon Sword was the Zenith Treasure of the Fierce Blade Sect, their sole Earth-grade artifact. Wu Qingtian’s first act upon becoming sect master was seizing this weapon reserved for the leader.

Now, he relied on its self-destruction to escape, his hatred for Luo Tian reaching its peak. Wu Qingtian no longer sought flight.

An Earth-grade artifact’s self-destruction was apocalyptic. Even Luo Tian, extraordinary as he was, would perish or suffer grievous wounds. Then Wu Qingtian would kill him and flee.

Feeling the sword was only a hundred zhang away, Luo Tian’s gaze shifted, but a powerful surge chilled his heart.

The green sword transformed into an overwhelming aura, annihilating ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators instantly.

A green mushroom cloud formed in the sky, thunderous sounds echoing over the Fierce Blade Sect. Invisible waves surged into the sect.

“Boom…!” The Fierce Blade Sect’s buildings collapsed, its cultivation-body disciples stared in terror at the green mushroom cloud.

“Will Luo Tian die?” A sect elder’s face contorted with fear, their minds trembling at the explosion.

“Not dead!” Wang Tianxiang’s eyes locked onto the sky, unwavering in his belief.

The Fierce Blade Sect’s disciples stood frozen, observing the battle to see if Luo Tian could survive.

Elders worried: would the Five Elements Sect retaliate against them? The Fierce Blade Sect was now a withered old man, unable to withstand even a whisper from the Five Elements.

“Dead!” Wu Qingtian’s face lit with cruel satisfaction, awaiting the mushroom cloud’s dissipation. He was certain he would die instantly, no chance of survival.

After several heartbeats, the smoke faded.

“Huangji Seal!” A cold voice echoed from the haze. A golden seal, radiating imperial authority, soared through the clouds as a meteor, instantly striking Wu Qingtian.

“Pf!” Wu Qingtian’s face contorted in disbelief, expecting a wounded Luo Tian. He never anticipated a fatal technique.

“Five Elements Rebirth… Imperial Seal…” The voice offered no mercy, another golden seal crashing down.

The imperial seal struck Wu Qingtian, who had already been wounded. His wings dimmed, vanishing into the earth with a resounding crash.

As Wu Qingtian fell, the mushroom cloud vanished.

A green cauldron hovered in the sky; Luo Tian smiled faintly, standing atop it. His body was pristine, untouched by injury.

“Crash…”

In the next instant, the soul-subduing cauldron and Luo Tian landed on the ground.

Chapter 504: You Dare Call Yourself a Patriarch?

Chapter 504: You Dare Call Yourself a Patriarch?

“Unscathed!” Fierce Blade Sect disciples gaped, staring at Luo Tian and his cauldron.

Luo Tian ignored their shock, moving like lightning to Wu Qingtian’s position. His foot descended with a crunching sound.

“Crunch…” Bones shattered, and Wu Qingtian’s desperate eyes met Luo Tian’s.

Jade-Glazed Flame flared at Luo Tian’s fingertips, piercing Wu Qingtian’s dantian.

After this, Luo Tian tossed Wu Qingtian to Wang Tianxiang.

“Leave it to you!” Luo Tian smiled gently, gazing at the Fierce Blade Sect’s back hills.

“Master! I’ve avenged you!” Wang Tianxiang roared, his bloodstained hammer raised high.

“Indeed, he deserves death!” Fierce Blade Sect disciples sneered, their eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

“Whirr…” The high-grade hammer sliced through the air, its bloodstained aura aimed at Wu Qingtian’s head.

Wang Tianxiang knew his body couldn’t pierce a Nascent Soul’s flesh. He targeted vital spots, striking repeatedly until Wu Qingtian died.

“Stop…” Just as Wang Tianxiang’s hammer neared Wu Qingtian’s head, a furious voice echoed.

The hammer halted mid-air, Wang Tianxiang drenched in sweat.

A ghostly figure materialized before him, snatching the hammer. A blue palm, infused with water-elemental energy, struck Wu Qingtian’s dantian.

“Sizzle…” A strange sound echoed from Wu Qingtian’s core.

People now recognized the intruder: Fierce Blade Sect elders fell to their knees, shouting, “Hail the Ancestral Lord!”

A white-haired elder, his face frozen in cold fury, surveyed the scene. His brows furrowed at the bloodstained ground.

“Five Elements Sect? Luo Tian? Leave, this is Fierce Blade business—do not interfere!” The elder spoke calmly.

“Ancestral Lord, Wu Qingtian schemed against the sect master… he…”

“Enough. I know.” Disciples spoke, but the elder cut them off with a wave.

“Ancestral Lord…” Elders gaped, surprised by his lack of anger, instead a hint of impatience.

“You are the Ancestral Lord?” Luo Tian smiled.

“Indeed, I am Zhao Lechi. If you have no business, leave. This is Fierce Blade territory.” Zhao Lechi forced a smile.

“Reluctant to kill him?” Luo Tian’s sharp mind grasped Zhao Lechi’s intent. His eyes mirrored the coldness of Nan Gong Xiu’s treatment of Deng Jiusi.

“Reluctant to kill. If he dies, Fierce Blade loses its second-tier status. Who would lead? Let the bone-fragment disciples become masters?” Zhao Lechi answered honestly.

“Ancestral Lord, he framed my master! You’d let him live?” Wang Tianxiang raged.

Fierce Blade disciples looked at Zhao Lechi in disbelief.

“Then find a Nascent Soul master to lead! I’ll kill them myself!” Zhao Lechi scowled.

“If I insist on killing him?” Luo Tian’s voice was cold.

“Young man, your talent is great, but you’re not my match. I won’t let you kill him. I can’t afford Five Elements Sect, but even a rabbit corners will bite!” Zhao Lechi’s face darkened.

“I’ve met many Ancestral Lords, but this is the first time I’ve seen a Nascent Soul peak call himself one. Your conduct is despicable. I wish to test if a Nascent Soul peak can withstand me!” Luo Tian sneered, his aura surging.

“Arrogant! A Nascent Soul peak!” Zhao Lechi’s fury erupted.

“Kill…” Luo Tian wasted no words, his spear flashing like lightning. Golden Serpents Split the Sky struck Zhao Lechi.

Zhao Lechi hadn’t expected a Nascent Soul peak to attack him so boldly. His face reddened with anger, an insult he hadn’t faced in years.

“Rippling…” Water-elemental energy surged, clashing with Luo Tian’s spear.

Luo Tian’s spear was like a boat in an ocean, swallowed within a breath.

“A Nascent Soul peak is formidable…” Luo Tian inwardly marveled, unleashing six steps of the Sealing Steps. His body became a blur, striking Zhao Lechi with the Life-Ending Fist.

Zhao Lechi’s mind reeled, stunned by Luo Tian’s speed. He barely reacted, retreating into waves.

Yet the fist still grazed Zhao Lechi’s body, draining ten years of vitality.

“Ten years…” Zhao Lechi hadn’t expected a mere touch to cost him ten years of life.

Luo Tian’s lips curled, ceasing pursuit. He stood still.

This pause shocked Zhao Lechi; he’d forgotten his purpose—Wu Qingtian still lay there.

Jade-Glazed Flame surged into Wu Qingtian’s dantian again. Luo Tian kicked him toward Wang Tianxiang, his voice icy: “Continue! The rest is mine.”

Chapter 505: Will You Save Him?

Chapter 505: Will You Save Him?

Seeing Luo Tian’s actions, Zhao Lechi seethed. This was no courtesy.

Wang Tianxiang hesitated, then lunged with his high-grade hammer.

He knew killing Wu Qingtian would exile him from Fierce Blade, but hatred for his master consumed him.

“Mortal!” Zhao Lechi’s form flashed like lightning, his ground shattering as he rushed Wang Tianxiang.

“Furnace of Heaven’s Flames!” Luo Tian snarled, a fire dragon erupting. It surged without pause into an inferno, blocking Zhao Lechi’s path.

Furnace of Heaven’s Flames was an Earth-grade technique. Luo Tian’s mastery over fire had reached perfection, and with Jade-Glazed Flame, its power tripled.

The inferno filled a hundred zhang, Luo Tian’s restraint preventing wider destruction. If he unleashed fully, the entire Fierce Blade Sect mountain would burn.

The scorching heat made elders recoil in fear, wondering what could survive such temperatures.

Zhao Lechi halted, but his body absorbed a touch of heat.

The heat seeped into Zhao Lechi’s pores, invading his Nascent Soul body.

Zhao Lechi’s face darkened as he felt the Jade-Glazed Flame, his dantian churning with water-elemental energy to smother the fire.

The Jade-Glazed Flame devoured Zhao Lechi’s body, blackening everything it touched. Even his soul threads burned.

“Extinguish!” Zhao Lechi roared, finally smothering the fire.

The process took a single breath, but Zhao Lechi’s face was drenched in sweat, his eyes wary of Luo Tian and the green flames surrounding him.

Meanwhile, Wang Tianxiang’s hammer struck Wu Qingtian’s head.

“Crash…” The collision echoed.

To Fierce Blade disciples’ shock, Wu Qingtian’s head remained intact—only a skin wound and blood.

“A Nascent Soul cultivator, even a bone-fragment strike only wounded him!” Disciples marveled.

“Die…” Wang Tianxiang ignored the shock, his arms bulging as he swung again.

“Crash… Crash…” The relentless strikes echoed, Wang Tianxiang’s rage unrelenting.

“Mortal!” Zhao Lechi finally snarled, his wings forming and launching into the sky.

“Come down!” Luo Tian sneered, summoning the Soul-Subduing Cauldron to block Zhao Lechi.

Luo Tian’s hands grasped the ground, flames凝聚 into a green prison, surrounding Zhao Lechi.

“Ancestral Lord Zhao, stay here for a while!” Luo Tian smiled.

Zhao Lechi’s mind trembled; the cauldron and fire prison felt apocalyptic. He sensed both could destroy him, even with his Nascent Soul peak.

“Damn… if not for…” Zhao Lechi seethed, but dared not fight.

Fierce Blade disciples gaped—how could Luo Tian trap their Ancestral Lord?

“An Nascent Soul peak, trapping a Nascent Soul peak. How monstrous!” Disciples shivered, their awe turning to reverence.

“Crash… Crash…” Wang Tianxiang’s hammer struck Wu Qingtian’s head relentlessly.

Though Wu Qingtian was a Nascent Soul, his wounds were fatal. His head sank into the earth.

“Crack…” A clear sound echoed as Wang Tianxiang’s hammer struck.

“Spurt!” Blood splattered onto Wang Tianxiang’s face.

Yet he ignored it, hammering with madness, his eyes blood-red, growling lowly.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed, sensing Wang Tianxiang’s madness. His spiritual sense surged into Wang Tianxiang’s mind, restoring clarity.

“Master… I’ve avenged you!” Wang Tianxiang roared, his voice echoing.

“Dead… dead…” Fierce Blade disciples trembled, their hearts stirred by Wu Qingtian’s death.

“Indeed, such a scum deserves death!” A disciple roared, forgetting Zhao Lechi.

As the first spoke, disciples cheered, their faces alight with relief.

Zhao Lechi, trapped in fire, his face pale, aged further. He foresaw Fierce Blade’s decline, hatred burning toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian patted Wang Tianxiang’s shoulder, turning to Zhao Lechi: “Ancestral Lord Zhao, Wu Qingtian is dead. Will you save him?”

Luo Tian lifted his hand, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron returned to his ring. Jade-Glazed Flame retreated into his palm, glowing emerald.

Chapter 506: Sect Master of Fierce Blade

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhao Lechi’s eyes darkened but dimmed. He knew he couldn’t fight Luo Tian. To kill him would cost dearly.

This youth had mastered a Nascent Soul peak clash, his Jade-Glazed Flame and tactics making Zhao Lechi uncertain.

Moreover, Zhao Lechi wouldn’t kill Luo Tian; Five Elements Sect’s might was too vast.

Zhao Lechi differed from Wu Qingtian—he could flee, but he was a sect’s Ancestral Lord, having lived in Fierce Blade for millennia. He cherished it deeply.

“Alas… go, leave…” Zhao Lechi sighed, waving his hand.

“Ancestral Lord Zhao, don’t rush to send me away. If I leave, what will you do with Wang Tianxiang?” Luo Tian smiled, dropping a pill into Wang Tianxiang’s mouth.

Wang Tianxiang gaped, then sat cross-legged.

“Who else? He remains Fierce Blade’s disciple!” Zhao Lechi sighed, unwilling to lose more.

“Then who will lead Fierce Blade?” Luo Tian asked calmly.

Zhao Lechi’s beard flared, his face reddening from blood: “What else? This is Fierce Blade’s matter. You shouldn’t interfere. Leave, I don’t want to see you again!”

“Can I help solve Fierce Blade’s problem? Will you still send me away?” Luo Tian smiled.

Luo Tian’s words struck Zhao Lechi like a thunderclap, his body trembling. He scrutinized Luo Tian, eyes brightening.

“Order: From now on, Wang Tianxiang is Fierce Blade’s new sect master. Anyone不服, kill!” Zhao Lechi commanded, his voice resolute.

“Gasps…” Elders gaped, stunned by the command. Yet some realized Zhao Lechi’s intent.

Luo Tian’s power was immense, his future promising. With Five Elements Sect behind him, he’d dominate North Domain.

Wang Tianxiang’s bond with Luo Tian was clear; otherwise, Luo Tian wouldn’t have aided him.

Zhao Lechi’s plan was evident: to ally with Luo Tian and Five Elements Sect, securing Fierce Blade’s status.

“Brilliant!” Elders marveled at Zhao Lechi’s calmness.

Luo Tian smiled inwardly, praising Zhao Lechi’s wisdom. With him backing Wang Tianxiang, no one would dare harm him.

“Luo young master, welcome to Fierce Blade. Forgive our earlier rudeness. I’ll personally host Wang Tianxiang’s sect master ceremony tomorrow!” Zhao Lechi smiled.

“Why linger? Prepare for Luo young master and the ceremony!” Zhao Lechi barked at stunned disciples.

“Then I’ll trouble you, Ancestral Lord!” Luo Tian smiled, watching Zhao Lechi.

“Damn!” Disciples who hadn’t left gaped at the sudden warmth, cursing their quick change of heart.

“Boom…” A deep sound echoed before Luo Tian. Disciples gaped—Wang Tianxiang had broken through!

“Crack…” A clear sound echoed as Wang Tianxiang’s body trembled. The air above Fierce Blade surged toward him.

Wang Tianxiang’s face contorted in pain, cracks forming on his skin. He opened his eyes, gazing at the sky.

“Open…” Wang Tianxiang roared, his body absorbing the gathered energy.

As energy flowed in, cracks vanished, restoring him to normal.

The thunderous clash echoed as Wang Tianxiang roared again, absorbing dense energy.

“Bone-fragment peak… good!” Zhao Lechi smiled at Wang Tianxiang.

“Thank you, Uncle!” Wang Tianxiang knelt, bowing to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian gently lifted him: “Enough with the formality. You’re now Fierce Blade’s sect master. By rank, you outrank me!”

“Luo Tian seems younger than Wang Tianxiang.”
“Nonsense! If I could be his father, I’d call him that!” Disciples chatted, leaving.

Hearing he was sect master in a blink, Wang Tianxiang gaped, then nodded to Zhao Lechi.

“Leave, I won’t disturb you. Help him with his soul-fragment issue!” Luo Tian smiled.

Luo Tian’s words shook Zhao Lechi; for millennia, he’d failed to advance past soul-fragment. It was his deepest secret and desire. Yet Luo Tian had sensed it.

Chapter 507: I’ve Returned to Five Elements Sect

Luo Tian smiled, recalling Zhao Lechi’s body during their clash. Otherwise, a Nascent Soul peak wouldn’t have been trapped so long.

“If I’m not mistaken, your cultivation method is flawed, causing a blocked meridian. Accumulated over years, it’s become dead—this is why you can’t advance!” Luo Tian explained.

Zhao Lechi was stunned; Luo Tian’s guess was precise.

“Not a method issue, but an old injury. When I ascended to Nascent Soul, I tried to mend it but failed, turning it into a dead meridian,” Zhao Lechi admitted.

“Do you know a way?” Zhao Lechi’s eyes lit with hope.

“There is. A sixth-grade pill can mend the meridian, then I’ll heal it,” Luo Tian smiled.

Hearing sixth-grade pills, Zhao Lechi’s face fell—rare in the North Domain. Not to mention his sect couldn’t afford it.

“Don’t worry, I have the materials. I’ll prepare and return to Five Elements Sect for more, then visit Great An Forest,” Luo Tian said.

Zhao Lechi’s face shifted; he realized Luo Tian was the disciple of Five Elements Sect’s Dan Pavilion. The Pavilion’s resources could easily produce sixth-grade pills.

“Once I refine the pill, I’ll return to visit you! I won’t stay long. Tianxiang is in your care!” Luo Tian bowed, preparing to leave.

Wang Tianxiang gaped: “Uncle…”

“Call me if trouble arises!” Luo Tian handed him vials of fourth and fifth-grade pills.

“These will help you through Nascent Soul. If unsure, seek Five Elements Sect—on soul-fragment trials, I’m experienced!” Luo Tian smiled.

Zhao Lechi marveled at Luo Tian’s generosity, but his face darkened upon recalling the last sentence. His eyes held newfound respect.

After exchanging pleasantries, Luo Tian left Fierce Blade under Wang Tianxiang and Zhao Lechi’s gaze.

“Tianxiang, is Luo Tian a cultivator?” Zhao Lechi hesitated.

“Yes, he was a fourth-grade cultivator when I first met him. His pills were eight-tenths plant-based. Five years later, his skills must have improved!” Wang Tianxiang smiled.

Hearing this, Zhao Lechi was stunned—such a young sixth-grade cultivator was unprecedented.

“Indeed, a prodigy!” Zhao Lechi sighed, praising his decision to make Wang Tianxiang sect master.

……

Luo Tian flew swiftly, night falling. Fierce Blade to Five Elements Sect took seven days by foot but only half a day for a Nascent Soul.

Now a Nascent Soul, returning to Five Elements Sect stirred memories—especially the towering five peaks.

Yet he didn’t dwell, knowing Five Elements Sect’s depth was beyond his current grasp.

Flying over the sect, a transparent barrier blocked him.

Luo Tian sighed, wondering why the mountain’s defense array was active.

No choice, he flew to the main gate. The grand entrance and towering stairway brought a smile.

Here, his name first echoed across the North Domain.

At the gate, Luo Tian felt at ease, seeing familiar robes on sentries. “Is it Dan Pavilion’s turn to guard?”

“Huh?” The two sentries gaped, wary. They constantly scanned for intruders but found none.

“Who are you?” A younger sentry barked, drawing his curved sword. His other hand gripped a thin thread by the gate.

If Luo Tian acted out, he’d pull the thread, summoning bone-fragment or Nascent Soul masters.

“Luo Tian Senior!” An older sentry recognized him, rushing forward to bow.

“Zhou Demin of the Herb Pavilion?” Luo Tian smiled, recalling the youth.

“Yes! You’ve returned!” Zhou Demin beamed, surprised Luo Tian remembered his name.

The younger sentry, seeing his senior’s reaction, also smiled—two years in Five Elements Sect, he’d memorized Luo Tian’s name. Now seeing him, he stood stunned.

Luo Tian, the sect’s legend, was a deity to Dan Pavilion disciples.

“Luo Tian Senior, I’ll inform the Pavilion Master and Grand Elder. Wait a moment!” Zhou Demin said, turning to run.

“This is your identity token! I’ll enter myself!” Luo Tian handed him the token, speaking gently.

Zhou Demin stopped, still excited. After verifying, he bowed: “Senior Luo, please enter!”

“Why are you still here? Open the gate for Senior Luo!” Zhou Demin barked at the youth.

Chapter 508: Unsettling Premonition

“Creak…” The gate opened. Luo Tian nodded to the two sentries, entering Fierce Blade Sect after two years.

Two years had changed nothing; the sect felt untouched by time. Night fell, silence reigned except for murmurs from the training ground.

Luo Tian walked the path, night no hindrance. No one was seen—only patrols passed him.

He reached his old courtyard, noticing a candle’s glow. “Did this place get reassigned?” He mused, stepping in. His spiritual sense probed the room, smiling as he patted his head.

“Forgot about them!” He chuckled inwardly. Ning Yuer and her daughter were inside, chatting. He didn’t listen—women’s matters weren’t his concern.

Seeing them tired, he sat on a stone tablet in the courtyard.

Soon, the lamp dimmed.

……

Morning sun kissed Luo Tian’s face; he opened his eyes, smiling at the door.

“Ah…” Ning Yuer stretched, yawning as she stepped out.
