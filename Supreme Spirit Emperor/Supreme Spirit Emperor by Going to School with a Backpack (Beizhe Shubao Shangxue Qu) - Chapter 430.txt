“Die!” Luo Tian's face bore a cold glint as he channeled Epoch Power, and the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword in his hand radiated a brilliant light. Lightning surged from the sword, piercing Meng Wende's massive body.

“Ah…” Lightning surged like a heavenly calamity within Meng Wende's body, with the ultimate refining power continuously consuming his flesh and soul, driving him to unbearable agony.

“We cannot let Meng Wende die!” Duan Hongfang and Cheng Zhengqing's faces darkened, their minds trembling. They had no chance to withstand Luo Tian's previous strike; if Meng Wende perished again, their situation would be even more dire.

“Kill!” After thinking, the two moved swiftly towards Luo Tian, one on each side, their bodies radiating formidable energy as they launched a devastating attack.

“Fury of the Barbarian God!” Complex barbarian patterns flickered across their bodies, enveloping them and enhancing their physical strength.

“Barbarian God's Second Step Shatters the Stars!” A deep roar echoed from their mouths as they took a massive step forward, executing the second of the Seven Steps of the Barbarian.

“Wum…” Luo Tian felt their attack, a cold smile on his face. Yet he pulled the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword from Meng Wende's back, turned sharply, and with a hand gesture, the sword hovered above his head, surging forward as a streak of light towards Duan Hongfang.

“Barbarian God's Fifth Step Subdues the World!” With a strike of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, Luo Tian ignored the severely wounded Meng Wende and took a golden step forward, executing the fifth of the Seven Steps towards Cheng Zhengqing.

“Peng…” Instantly, two golden feet collided in the sky, a powerful explosion echoing from their clash.

Luo Tian and Cheng Zhengqing both flew backward, spitting blood. Meanwhile, Meng Wende's massive body fell from the sky, his eyes showing weakness. A black wound pierced his back, with threads of lightning swirling around it.

“Pup…” More pitiful was Duan Hongfang, who was split in two by the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, his body falling to the ground and slowly recovering.

A murmur spread as members of various barbarian factions gazed in horror at Luo Tian standing in the sky, wiping blood from his lips.

“One man, one royal weapon, felling three peak-level opponents who could not resist!” People trembled in their hearts, their gazes toward Luo Tian now different.

“Truly strong!” Man Cheng's face bore admiration as he secretly calculated whether he could match Luo Tian wielding the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword with his clan's artifact.

“Did you see that? This bastard is abnormal. Even if a near-king arrived, this kid might escape!” Man Hun sneered, feeling a mix of emotions.

“But he's currently in the late Epoch. Once this matter is settled and the royal heir awakens, I'll take the opportunity to deal with him. Revenge for the past!” Man Hun mused, his eyes gleaming as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Now it's your turn!” Luo Tian held the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, standing beneath the sky, his icy gaze fixed on Cheng Zhengqing nearby.

“You should die!” Cheng Zhengqing's face paled, fear creeping in. He hadn't expected Luo Tian, despite his decline, to be so formidable.

As Cheng Zhengqing was astounded, Luo Tian's form vanished from his sight again, causing him to startle.

“It's that trick again!” Cheng Zhengqing's face turned pale. He had seen Meng Wende's suffering under Luo Tian's move, still lying on the ground.

“Wum…” Though Cheng Zhengqing feared, he had no choice but to press on. Among the three, only he remained combat-ready; the others hadn't recovered.

“Hoo…” The massive body roared skyward, spewing a gray chain that wrapped around Cheng Zhengqing. At the same time, gray light formed a barrier with flowing runes surrounding him.

“That must be the Cheng family's technique—burning soul to enhance flesh! The old ancestor of the Cheng clan is truly fighting for survival!”

“How could he not fight for his life? Haven't you seen the Cheng family's old ancestor's suffering?” People murmured, eyes filled with admiration.

“Wum…” As the barrier formed before Cheng Zhengqing, Luo Tian appeared behind him, sword in hand, striking at Cheng Zhengqing.

“Crack…” The barrier shattered with a crack, and Luo Tian closed in, stabbing Cheng Zhengqing.

Crisis instantly overwhelmed Cheng Zhengqing's mind, cold sweat streaming down his face.

The blue sword touched Cheng Zhengqing's body, but only pierced his skin slightly, inflicting a minor wound.

“What's going on?” Everyone was puzzled, eyes filled with disbelief. They couldn't fathom why Luo Tian suddenly stopped.

“Is it fear of a curse?” Man Hun muttered, equally puzzled. Based on his knowledge of Luo Tian, he knew he wouldn't stop.

Luo Tian's face darkened, standing in the sky. He felt his cultivation power moving sluggishly, its speed decreasing until it seemed to solidify.

“Haha!” Cheng Zhengqing then seemed to realize something, his face contorted in arrogance. “It finally worked!”

“You dare to be so arrogant!” Cheng Zhengqing's face bore wild confidence as he punched Luo Tian in the chest.

“Crack…” A crackling sound echoed through the sky as Luo Tian was smashed down by Cheng Zhengqing's punch.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed, dust swirling as a deep pit formed in the Meng family's territory.

“What's happening?” Everyone was stunned. They hadn't expected the overwhelmingly advantaged Luo Tian to suddenly stop and be wounded by Cheng Zhengqing.

“Haha, from today on, the barbarian clan is ours!” Meng Wende and Duan Hongfang had recovered, their pale faces showing wild joy.

“Bragging!” Man Hun sneered. Though he didn't know Luo Tian's condition, he knew something was wrong. If he didn't act, Luo Tian might perish—something he couldn't allow.

“The Duan family rebels today!” Duan Hongfang's face was wild, his gaze on the Barbarian God Palace, voice filled with arrogance.

“The Cheng family rebels today as well. The barbarian clan needs a new master!” Cheng Zhengqing added, eyes confident.

“What!” The entire barbarian clan erupted in shock, eyes filled with disbelief.

“You're asking for death! We were waiting to catch you in the act, but now you've confessed yourselves!”

“Hm?” However, as Man Hun activated his cultivation power, his face changed abruptly. He discovered his power moved sluggishly and halted upon activation.

“What's going on!” Not only Man Hun, but also Man Cheng and those around him showed confusion. How could they ignore the situation when Duan Hongfang and Cheng Zhengqing spoke thus? Yet they soon found themselves in the same predicament as Man Hun.

“Haha, Man Hun, can't you feel your power isn't moving? You really think we'd dare to rebel without confidence?”

“I was hesitant before, but that kid killed the Meng family. You did nothing and even approved his actions—this is treating us as nothing!”

“What strength do they have to rebel? They couldn't even beat that person. He's just in the late Epoch, while Man Hun and Sa Man are near kings!”

“Why can't my power move?” Soon, the entire Manghuang City discovered the same issue as Luo Tian and others.

“Out, Duan family!” Duan Hongfang shouted towards his clan. A line of towering giants emerged from the Duan family, eyes cold.

On the other side, Cheng family members also emerged, heading toward the Meng family's direction, faces showing excitement.

Chapter 1683: Invisible Ice Soul Powder

Panic spread rapidly through Manghuang City. Everyone's faces showed horror, watching the two groups gathering toward the Meng family.

Not only others, but even those unaware of the Duan and Cheng families' plans looked bewildered, not knowing their elders harbored such schemes.

“Boom…” A countless number of barbarian giants appeared over the Meng family's territory, filling the sky with determined gazes.

“You definitely have secrets!” Man Hun's face darkened, watching the two families' tens of thousands of people filling the sky above Meng family's territory.

“How many years have we waited? Finally today! Though this kid's appearance hastened our plan, the results are good!”

“Hear this, Manghuang City! Surrenderers will not be killed!” Cheng Zhengqing's face bore authority, his voice echoing through the city, causing anger on its people.

“Cheng Zhengqing, with your single Epoch peak, do you think you can control the barbarian clan?”

The elder was Wang, one of six Epoch peaks in Manghuang City. His family's territory was closest to the Meng family.

“Die!” Duan Hongfang's face showed coldness. He struck the elder, his gray hand pushing through the sky and slamming into him.

“Old bastard! I've disliked you for a long time. You were the first to speak up!”

“Peng…” The palm struck, blood mist rising. The elder couldn't use his power and relied on his body to block, only to be crushed by Duan Hongfang's strike.

“Die!” Cheng Zhengqing's face also showed coldness. Having decided to rebel, there was no turning back. He pointed, and refining power shot from his hand, wrapping around the elder's flesh, completely refining him.

“Ah…” The Wang family roared, eyes red, gazing at Duan Hongfang's group with a determined look to fight.

“Our barbarian clan dies standing, not kneeling. Want us to submit? Dream on!”

The Wang family's words ignited the barbarian clan's ferocity, their roars piercing the sky.

“Though we lack cultivation, we have our bodies. We die before surrendering!”

“We know it's not easy, so we'll fight!”

Duan Hongfang sneered, then spoke again: “Last time: surrenderers will not be killed!”

“We'll die before surrendering!”

“Fight them, bastards!”

The people of Manghuang City roared, their massive bodies emerging from their territories to gather before the Barbarian God Palace.

“Lord Man Hun, issue the order!” The barbarian giants roared toward the Barbarian God Palace.

“Everyone, retreat into the Barbarian God Palace!” However, Man Hun's voice echoed in their ears.

“This…” Upon hearing Man Hun's words, the barbarian people's faces changed. But they weren't fools; since Man Hun said so, he must have been caught too.

“Kill!” Duan Hongfang and Cheng Zhengqing's faces showed coldness as they ordered their people.

“Kill!” Their roars shook the sky as the two clans' warriors surged toward the Barbarian God Palace.

Though the people of Manghuang City entered the Barbarian God Palace quickly, many didn't make it.

Soon, the two clans' nearly thirty thousand warriors appeared at the Barbarian God Palace's perimeter, initiating a massacre.

Those who didn't enter the Barbarian God Palace, though their bodies were strong, died instantly at the hands of Duan and Cheng families' warriors.

“You go in first; I'll fight them!” Seeing this, the people at the perimeter went mad, charging toward the two clans' warriors.

Blood stained the Barbarian Palace's perimeter, spreading throughout Manghuang City. This was the first time such a scene occurred since the city's founding.

“This is the crisis Lord Sa Man spoke of?” Man Hun stood in the Barbarian Palace, his eyes filled with sorrow.

Almost instantly, the barbarian clan suffered heavy losses. Man Hun couldn't believe Duan Hongfang's plan had outwitted two minor Epoch peaks.

“Savior, what to do!” Man Cheng and others' eyes were red as they gazed at the barbarian giants lying in blood.

It was too tragic; some had only resisted and were torn to pieces, falling into blood.

“Uuuh…” Crying echoed through Manghuang City. Though Duan and Cheng families' warriors slaughtered those entering the Barbarian Palace, they spared children to sustain the city.

“Forty thousand…” In a moment, nearly forty thousand people in Manghuang City were annihilated, with more deaths still rising.

“What is this thing that even my cultivation power is sealed?”

Though Man Hun was desperately anxious, he kept thinking about what method Duan Hongfang and Cheng Zhengqing used.

“Man Hun, can you bear to watch these people die?”

“If you and Sa Man, and Man Cheng, step out voluntarily and commit suicide before us, we'll stop!”

“Impossible!” The barbarian people roared, charging at the two clans' warriors with wild abandon.

Sa Man, the spiritual leader of the barbarian clan, was an ultimate presence in their eyes, guiding them forward.

“What to do? What is this thing!”

Man Cheng roared, eyes burning with fury at the dead. His cultivation power was frozen like ice, unable to move. If he charged out now, he could kill many but would perish himself.

Man Hun faced the same situation as Man Cheng, but he knew he couldn't panic. If he did, it would be over.

“Our clan's crisis has arrived!” An old voice echoed as the elder Sa Man stepped out of the Barbarian God Palace, his face showing sorrow.

“Lord Sa Man!” The people in the hall showed joy, gazing respectfully at the elder.

“If I'm not mistaken, Invisible Ice Soul Powder is colorless and odorless. Prolonged absorption will freeze cultivation.”

The elder Sa Man spoke with admiration.

“They must have planned this, releasing the powder in Manghuang City beforehand. We were tricked!”

“Lord Sa Man, is there a way to break it?”

People's hearts worried upon hearing Sa Man. They asked, if they regained cultivation, all problems would be solved. Even Man Hun or Sa Man could crush the enemy.

“This Invisible Ice Soul Powder is cold. Perhaps heavenly fire could break it, but we don't have it. I know the Star Moon Clan has a heavenly fire. I could borrow it, but if I go out, it's risky!”

“Heavenly fire!” The people fell silent, disappointment in their eyes.

“Heavenly fire? I remember he has a seven-color flame, very terrifying. Not sure if it's heavenly fire!”

Man Hun's eyes showed thought, then brightened as he remembered Luo Tian.

“The speed is slow, but there's still time!”

Meng Wende spoke softly, his face pale but eyes filled with hatred.

Among the three families, Meng was strongest. But Luo Tian's strike had annihilated them all. It was Meng Wende's life's work, destroyed by one sword.

Thinking this, Meng Wende's eyes showed hatred. He gazed at the black pit where Luo Tian had fallen, who hadn't moved since.

“You little bastard, today you're dead. You'll feel so trapped in my hands!”

Meng Wende's face was cold as he flew down toward the black hole.

“Crack…” As Meng Wende reached the hole, a blue lightning shot up, startling him.

“Pup…” Before Meng Wende could react, the blue sword pierced his heart, lightning filling his body.

“You think you can kill me?”

Cold, disdainful voice echoed. Hot energy burst from the hole as seven-color flames surrounded Luo Tian, who soared out, grabbing Meng Wende's neck and lifting him.

“Old fool, I said you die—so you must!”

Luo Tian's face was cold as he pulled with force, blood mist rising.

Chapter 1684: Meeting Chen Zhanbiao

Blood mist rose. Luo Tian's face was cold, his body bathed in seven-color flames. He pointed, and the fire surged like a master of flame, burning Meng Wende's soul.

“How is this possible!” Duan Hongfang and Cheng Zhengqing's faces showed disbelief. They couldn't believe Luo Tian still had strength, even though it could suppress near-kings.

“Thankfully, there's Xiao Qi!” Luo Tian thought, relieved. He hadn't expected such a thing existed, freezing even Epoch-level cultivation.

“Invisible Ice Soul Powder!” Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile. He had thought he was done, but remembered Gu Lei's introduction of various poisons, including this one. Gu Lei had praised it but never created it.

“Now it's your turn!” Luo Tian coldly smiled, wielding the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and attacking Cheng Zhengqing and Duan Hongfang.

“It's him!” The barbarians were stunned, seeing Luo Tian kill Meng Wende. Their disbelief turned to joy.

“Haha, our barbarian clan is saved!” The people in the Barbarian God Palace were excited. Some had tears, having felt despair but now seeing a reversal.

Those who knew Luo Tian's true identity fell silent, eyes complex. They had previously advised Man Hun to capture him but now he'd saved the clan.

“It's him. When did he arrive?” Elder Sa Man's eyes glowed, gazing at Luo Tian battling Cheng Zhengqing and Duan Hongfang.

“It's really a coincidence! A clan leader from the city brought him back!”

“He definitely has a connection to our clan!”

Elder Sa Man sighed, then his eyes showed a smile.

“Kill!” Luo Tian wielded the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, his body wrapped in seven-color flames. He struck, appearing before Duan Hongfang.

Duan Hongfang was already severely wounded, having been split in two by the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. He couldn't match Luo Tian, who pierced him with a strike of lightning and seven-color flames.

Blue smoke rose. Duan Hongfang's massive body was refined into blue smoke by the two forces.

“Now it's your turn!” Luo Tian annihilated Duan Hongfang, then suddenly turned to attack Cheng Zhengqing.

“You should die!” Cheng Zhengqing's face was as pale as his name. He hadn't expected this twist.

Facing Luo Tian with the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, Cheng Zhengqing had no will to fight. Three together couldn't match Luo Tian; now alone, what could he do?

“Flee…” Cheng Zhengqing thought of escaping, then charged toward the outer regions.

“Wum…” But soon, waves of energy echoed—the barrier from the clan's weapon, the Wolf Fang Mace.

“Burst!” Cheng Zhengqing collided with the golden barrier, which twisted slightly.

However, a royal weapon was still a royal weapon. Even an Epoch peak couldn't break through quickly.

Cheng Zhengqing's massive body was repelled by the golden barrier, crashing to the ground.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian attacked, colliding with the repelled Cheng Zhengqing.

Luo Tian didn't hesitate. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword pierced Cheng Zhengqing's head, splitting him.

Blood rain fell. Luo Tian summoned two golden hands, grabbing the falling pieces of Cheng Zhengqing.

“Die!” Luo Tian sneered, crushing the pieces. Cheng Zhengqing's soul scattered as smoke.

“They're dead! All three!” The people in the Barbarian God Palace showed joy, cheering.

“Huh…” Man Hun and others smiled, exhaling relief.

Luo Tian stood in the sky, gazing at the blood-stained Manghuang City. This internal strife had cost the clan heavily, with over a million lost.

These were people with strength. The city's population was only millions, and the three families had cost it a fifth.

“First, deal with the current issue!” Luo Tian sighed, moving to the sky, his sword unleashing a storm.

The world-destroying power returned. Even the two clans' warriors were like ants before the Epoch treasure, annihilated in large numbers.

“Kill…” Luo Tian charged into the battlefield where Duan and Cheng families fought.

Luo Tian, like a death god from hell, wielded his scythe, harvesting lives.

Time passed. After an hour, Luo Tian was covered in blood, eyes bright, slaying the last Cheng family member.

“Hoo…” Deep roars echoed in and outside the Barbarian God Palace. The barbarians gazed at Luo Tian with admiration, slapping their shoulders.

“Thank you this time!” An old voice echoed as Sa Man and others emerged, smiling at Luo Tian's bloodied form.

“Elder Sa Man!” Luo Tian bowed, smiling. His white teeth showed, making Man Cheng shiver at the memory of his ruthless slaughter.

“No need to be polite. Without you, we wouldn't have known how to survive this crisis!” Sa Man spoke softly.

“I'll first help you all remove the toxins!” Luo Tian sighed, hands moving. Seven-color flames flew out, shattering into sparks that fell on the giants.

Thunderous sounds rose from each giant. Their cultivation returned as the sparks entered.

“Done. Man Hun, handle it. I have some words to say alone!” Sa Man ordered, nodding at Luo Tian.

“Come with me. See our royal heir's condition!” Sa Man led Luo Tian into the Barbarian God Palace.

“Hm.” Luo Tian nodded, following Sa Man. He was now at ease, even if the clan turned on him—those people had let seven-color sparks into their bodies. Though he meant no harm, he couldn't be careless.

Luo Tian followed Elder Sa Man into the Barbarian God Palace. It wasn't his first visit; he had forced entry before, but hurriedly.

Now, Luo Tian's body was normal size. Sa Man also shrank to human height. The massive buildings seemed disproportionate, making them appear like ants.

“Our Barbarian God Palace is like the Star Moon Clan's. You're the first human to enter!”

Hearing this, Luo Tian's heart tensed. He'd entered the Star Moon Clan's palace before, filled with things he feared. This Barbarian God Palace must be no less complex.

“Relax. I have no ill intent. Though we're fierce, we don't like fighting. We moved to the Nine Domains because our origin domain was too small for ancient clans!”

Under Sa Man's guidance, they turned left and right for nearly an hour before stopping at a grand door.

Chapter 1685: The Sleeping Chen Zhanbiao

“Huru…” As Luo Tian and Sa Man approached the door, snoring echoed inside. Luo Tian smiled.

“Still the same!” Luo Tian muttered, but his eyes showed tension. He gazed at Sa Man.

“Zhanbiao!” Luo Tian tried to send a message, but Chen Zhanbiao didn't react. His soul seemed sealed.

“Where did Wan Lingkong send Zhanbiao!”

Luo Tian cursed inwardly, eyes tense. He found no abnormalities in Chen Zhanbiao's soul.

“How is he?” Sa Man asked softly, concern in his eyes. He knew Chen Zhanbiao's relationship with Luo Tian.

“I need to observe carefully!” Luo Tian sighed, voice showing concern. This was his first time.

“Ah…” Sa Man's face showed disappointment but he didn't give up. He told Luo Tian, “Ask for anything you need; I'll guard outside.”

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded, no longer polite. He watched Sa Man leave, then sat cross-legged, recalling the teachings of the Heaven-Subduing Lord and the Soul-Sealing Master.

“Wum…” The humming returned. Luo Tian's soul emerged, flying toward Chen Zhanbiao.

However, as Luo Tian approached Chen Zhanbiao's body, waves of energy erupted. Golden light flowed over him, with complex runes emitting power that blocked Luo Tian's soul.

“What is this?” Luo Tian's eyes showed shock. He hadn't expected his soul to fail against the golden light.

“What is this? Is it protecting Zhanbiao or harming him, preventing outsiders from possessing his body?”

Luo Tian pondered, eyes confused.

“No matter who set this, I'll find out. If it helps Zhanbiao, thank you. If it harms him, I'll find and destroy the culprit!”

Luo Tian's soul returned to his body, face cold as he muttered.

Then, Luo Tian stared at the sleeping Chen Zhanbiao. His hands emitted waves, surrounding him.

Time passed. Seven days, Luo Tian's eyes never blinked, watching Chen Zhanbiao, his purple eyes bloodshot.

“Found!” Luo Tian roared, his eyes glowing. He showed disbelief before turning cold.

“Soul-Sealing Master! Planting soul, nurturing soul!”

Luo Tian muttered, voice cold. His mind was in turmoil.

After seven days of non-stop observation, Luo Tian found the cause. He discovered a hidden mark on Chen Zhanbiao's soul after seven days.

“What is nurturing the soul?” Elder Sa Man entered, eyes puzzled.
