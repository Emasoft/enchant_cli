The Nail hovered in the void, pinning the old man's soul to the emptiness above, causing people's minds to tremble with fear.

As the dust settled, Luo Tian's figure emerged into view, causing Master Jueying and others to display expressions of disbelief.

"How could this be?" All were in denial, for they had all witnessed Luo Tian's exhaustion. He had been severely wounded first and then subdued by the Wheel of Reincarnation Array.

"Did you betray me?" Luo Tian's face bore a smile as he gazed at the old man whose soul was pinned in the void.

"Master of Ghosts!" Luo Tian's voice rang coldly as he strode toward the old man, seizing his soul in hand.

People could clearly see a blood hole on Luo Tian's other shoulder and palm.

Master of Ghosts, Zhou Qinghua, was usually low-key within the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall, specializing in raising ghostly creatures. None could fathom how such a low-key elder had become the traitor within.

"How can you prove I betrayed you?" Zhou Qinghua shouted, his gray soul trembling violently as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Indeed, Luo Tian, Old Zhou has always been low-key!" Others also spoke up, for the eight masters maintained good relations, having spent countless years together in the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall.

"Evidence? I was not the only one who betrayed me!" Luo Tian's smile deepened as his gaze swept over Master Jueying and the others.

As Luo Tian's eyes passed over them, the masters and elders lowered their heads; the situation had been too perilous. Even an Immortal Peak cultivator might have perished.

If Luo Tian had died, they would all face dire consequences. Given the Black and White Yan's willingness to defy other halls' masters for Luo Tian, they would not escape unscathed. Even Master Jueying would face punishment.

"Too powerful! He survived even that. The Holy Son might be the second strongest in our Wheel of Reincarnation Hall!" The disciples of the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall displayed reverence.

"But what happened just now? Was the Holy Son betrayed by Master of Ghosts?" The disciples gazed at Luo Tian and others, bewildered, awaiting the unfolding events.

"I'll show you the evidence!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and a golden light appeared in his palm. A mirror the size of a palm began to expand gradually.

"Accursed Mirror!" Seeing the mirror beside Luo Tian, people gasped in unison.

Luo Tian pressed a hand seal and pointed at the mirror, etching a spell upon it. The yellow copper mirror transformed, revealing scenes before their eyes.

The images depicted Luo Tian's battle against the Wheel of Reincarnation Array. In the scene, Luo Tian sat on the ground, while Master of Ghosts flicked his finger with a barely perceptible motion.

"Indeed it was him!" No one doubted Luo Tian's involvement, for it was the Accursed Mirror.

"Old Zhou, why did you do this?" People's gazes turned to Zhou Qinghua, puzzled by his actions.

"Eventually, we all die; human nature is selfish!" Zhou Qinghua's gray eyes flickered with a smile, his gaze filled with regret as he looked at Luo Tian.

Black mist emanated from Zhou Qinghua's soul, corroding it rapidly—due to the blood oath. He howled in agony.

"Don't... believe... Luo Shengmen!" Zhou Qinghua roared, his voice laced with regret before vanishing from sight.

"What a terrifying force!" Luo Tian mused, having encountered the Luo Shengmen repeatedly recently. Their persistence was unnerving, always lurking in the shadows.

"What did he mean by that?" Others remained puzzled, exchanging glances.

"Why target the Holy Son of the Ten Halls? What is their goal—unifying Hell?" Luo Tian's mind brimmed with questions, a heavy sense of foreboding. The Luo Shengmen were too vast and hidden, impossible to guard against.

Luo Tian had indeed faced a dire situation. That Nail was no ordinary object, its unique resonance piercing him. He had barely managed to pull it out; if he'd delayed even a moment, the Wheel of Reincarnation Array would have reduced him to flesh.

Direct arrows are easy to dodge, but hidden ones are hard to guard against. Luo Tian feared those who struck from the shadows; if they confronted him openly, he would not fear them.

"As for the other conspirators against me, I'll keep their identities secret for now. Take care of yourselves," Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze on Master Jueying and others.

It was not that he did not wish to expose them, but he truly did not know. By saying this, he aimed to unsettle the culprit; once they panicked, mistakes would follow, possibly prompting action.

"Now, may I take the Wheel of Reincarnation?" Luo Tian ignored the silent Master Jueying and others, continuing.

"The Holy Son should recover first before taking it," Master Jueying's face showed concern and regret as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"A minor wound, nothing more," Luo Tian replied softly, stepping into the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall. He swiftly reached its final level, where the Wheel of Reincarnation resided.

The vast Wheel of Reincarnation radiated divine laws, rotating slowly, its surface etched with incomprehensible runes.

"Respected elder, please lend me your aid!" Luo Tian stood before the Wheel of Reincarnation, aware it was no ordinary treasure. He clasped his hands in a bow.

"Buzz..." Divine light descended, enveloping Luo Tian's body. A strange emotion filled him, as if a mother gazing at her child, warming his heart.

Luo Tian could clearly feel his wounds healing rapidly.

"World's Power!" Luo Tian marveled internally, yet sighed inwardly. If his World Heart remained, his recovery would be terrifying.

The black Wheel of Reincarnation radiated waves; in Luo Tian's view, it gradually shrank until it rested before him.

Luo Tian extended his hand to grasp the Wheel of Reincarnation, a smile on his face as he soared out of the final level of the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall.

"Is the Holy Son safe?" Master Jueying and others rushed forward upon emerging, their gazes filled with conflict, reluctant to let Luo Tian take the Wheel of Reincarnation.

"Safe," Luo Tian smiled, "I'll inform the Hall Master. Once he arrives, he'll see it. Time is pressing; I must depart."

Luo Tian smiled and took flight, exiting the Wheel of Reincarnation Hall toward the Gate of Cang.

Luo Tian faced no obstacles, his journey back to the Gate of Cang marked by relentless effort. He returned discreetly, avoiding any disturbances or leaks.

Time passed slowly; seven days later, Luo Tian flew past the military camp of the Tianlan Sect toward Tianlan Sect, aiming to enter the Immortal Realm. He concealed his form, passing through Tianlan Sect. However, as he crossed it, a surge of divine light rose from his back, two characters glaringly prominent.

Chapter 2573: Returning to the Immortal Realm ()

"This damned thing, I forgot about it!" Luo Tian's face bore a bitter smile, feeling the "Ghost Valley" characters on his back. Previously in Hell, those characters hadn't appeared; he'd thought they wouldn't again.

"Troubling," Luo Tian mused, but now with his strength, he could walk unchallenged in the Middle Three Heavens.

Luo Tian strode boldly toward the base of Tianlan Mountain, knowing that even if he concealed his form, he'd be discovered. It was better to walk past Tianlan Mountain.

"I'll head straight for the Tianyuan Sect; prepare yourselves!" Luo Tian sent a message to Long Jie and others without ascending Tianlan Mountain.

"Master!" Seeing Luo Tian, the guards surrounding Tianlan Mountain displayed reverence.

Most of Tianlan Mountain's people were strong cultivators from the Tianyuan Sect, so they naturally recognized Luo Tian.

Luo Tian nodded and passed through the guards, entering the Immortal Realm's territory with a sigh.

Though that path had once been part of the Immortal Realm, its skies were blue with sunlight. However, after Hell's forces occupied it, it felt somewhat sinister. But upon crossing Tianlan Sect, that feeling vanished entirely.

"Big brother, wait for me!" As Luo Tian prepared to continue walking, a thunderous voice echoed in his ears, prompting a smile on his lips.

A crackling sound rang out; several figures rushed toward Luo Tian's direction—Chen Zhanbiao, Yao Chen, Diao Dezhu, and Zhang Chenglong, Sun Kienian.

They appeared before Luo Tian instantly. Upon seeing him, Chen Zhanbiao shouted: "Big brother, I'm coming with you!"

"Indeed, staying here is dull. Following this fellow will surely bring a fight!" Yao Chen's eyes gleamed with divine light, gazing at the "Ghost Valley" characters on Luo Tian's back.

"We'll leave first; this place isn't suitable for us. If there's trouble, we'll return!" Zhang Chenglong addressed Luo Tian. They had longed to leave; their carefree nature made staying here unbearable, but they'd stayed for the purpose of finding Rebirth Grass. Now that Luo Tian had returned, they could depart.

"Alright, I've troubled you," Luo Tian nodded. There was no major issue now; the two sides were at peace.

"Take care!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Sun Kienian and the others.

"Going!" Zhang Chenglong and his disciples laughed, taking flight toward the distance. Though their destination was unknown, Luo Tian knew that if the Tianyuan Sect faced trouble, they'd return.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian smiled and headed toward the Tianyuan Sect with Diao Dezhu, Yao Chen, and Chen Zhanbiao.

As Hell attacked the Immortal Realm, chaos reigned. All sects were in peril, especially those guarding the ghost gates, which had been invaded for millions of miles. Some sects were destroyed.

Though the Middle Three Heavens hadn't suffered heavy losses, if the war continued, the hundred sects of the Middle Three Heavens would be consumed seven or eight times.

Yet even so, the Middle Three Heavens were now teeming with people, and many from the Upper Three Heavens had arrived to support.

Luo Tian's group moved swiftly; an Immortal Peak cultivator's speed was beyond the reach of True Realm experts, so they weren't discovered.

However, on the third day of their flight, Luo Tian's group was still spotted.

Xuanming Mountain, a common mountain in the Middle Three Heavens. Though called ordinary, it harbored danger for True Realm experts.

As Luo Tian's group flew over Xuanming Mountain, they felt a series of thunderous roars. A patch of green clouds drifted into their view.

"Ah, old acquaintances!" Yao Chen's face bore a cold smile as he gazed at the banner floating on the ground.

Thirty thousand people, dressed uniformly, led by an Immortal Peak mid-stage and another at the beginning stage.

The vast sky echoed with their overwhelming presence, making the heavens yield. No one dared to block them; they could only stand on the ground, gazing upward in awe.

"Eternal Life Mountain!" Luo Tian stood there, speaking softly with a smile, awaiting the army's arrival.

"Who dares to block Eternal Life Mountain's forces?" As Luo Tian and his group stood there, a furious shout echoed through the heavens.

"You all should retreat; you're still Tianyuan Sect disciples, unfit to fight," Luo Tian addressed Diao Dezhu and the others.

"That's not certain!" Yao Chen chuckled, his aura shifting; his monkey fur gradually vanished, transforming into a robust man. Though resembling Yao Chen slightly, those unfamiliar would never recognize him.

Diao Dezhu, skilled in transformation, changed into a scholarly youth.

"Little dog, change me too!" Chen Zhanbiao barked, grabbing Diao Dezhu and shouting.

"Change! Change! Change!" Diao Dezhu, struggling under Chen Zhanbiao's grip, unleashed divine laws. Chen Zhanbiao's form gradually transformed.

Luo Tian saw the three change their appearances, waiting for Eternal Life Mountain's army to arrive. His eyes glowed golden.

"Immortal Peak mid-stage!" The leader of Eternal Life Mountain's army narrowed his eyes, sensing Luo Tian's cultivation.

"I'll see who my old friend is," Luo Tian smiled, watching the army draw closer.

"How could there be characters?" As the army approached, the elder saw the golden light on Luo Tian's back, revealing the "Ghost Valley" characters.

"Ghost... Valley..."

"Chen Tianqi!" Luo Tian and Eternal Life Mountain's leader spoke simultaneously, their gazes locking across the void.

"Chen Tianqi!" The next moment, Chen Tianqi's face paled instantly, his eyes filled with terror. His body halted abruptly.

As Chen Tianqi stopped, the other Immortal Peak beginning and his thirty thousand troops also halted. Due to distance, others only saw figures.

"How could it be him? Quick! Retreat back to Eternal Life Mountain!" Chen Tianqi shouted, recalling the battle at Eternal Life Mountain. At that time, he and other Immortal Peak mid-stage cultivators had entered the Eternal Life Palace but hadn't participated in the real battle.

Yet after exiting, all Immortal Peak beginning cultivators had died—sufficient to terrify Chen Tianqi. Luo Tian had left a deep shadow in his mind.

Moreover, Chen Tianqi had sensed that Luo Tian had reached Immortal Peak mid-stage, matching his level.

"Get on the boat! Run!" Chen Tianqi didn't hesitate, waving his hand to summon a green wooden boat that expanded instantly.

"Master, what's wrong?" The young Immortal Peak beginning cultivator looked puzzled; he was a newly promoted Immortal Peak beginning, his first time seeing Chen Tianqi so shaken.

"Luo Tian! That's Luo Tian, the heir of Ghost Valley. He was the one who caused chaos at Eternal Life Mountain. You all take this boat and flee; I'll go first!" Chen Tianqi shouted, his body darting away.

"What?" Hearing Chen Tianqi's words, people erupted in chaos. Amid the commotion, many rushed toward the green boat.

"Luo Tian!" Hearing Chen Tianqi's words, the young man shivered and immediately boarded the green boat without hesitation, urging it to follow Chen Tianqi's direction. He didn't care if others boarded.

"Want to run?" As Chen Tianqi took flight, Luo Tian's Yellow River Step appeared instantly, rushing toward the army.

"Chase!" Luo Tian smiled softly, his body moving swiftly, instantly reaching the green boat. Without hesitation, he crashed into it.

"Run! He's coming!" The young Immortal Peak beginning cultivator shouted, spitting blood as he desperately urged the green boat.

Boom...

But no matter how fast, it couldn't match Luo Tian's speed. His body crashed into the green boat carrying tens of thousands, as the young man had driven it. Not all had boarded.

The thunderous sound echoed; the green boat exploded instantly, shaking the heavens. The sky turned blood-red.

One collision resulted in tens of thousands dying; the remaining fell from the sky.

"Run..." The young man's heart froze, but he still wanted to escape. He remembered how powerful Luo Tian had been in that battle; he was then at True Realm peak, knowing how formidable Luo Tian had been.

Boom...

But before he could flee, a large hand slammed down on him, sending him crashing into the ground like a fly.

"I surrender!" Those who hadn't boarded the green boat stammered, secretly thanking themselves for not boarding and having a chance to surrender.

"Too terrifying!" Everyone's hearts trembled; it was too terrifying.

"Come here," Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing the young man he'd sent crashing into the ground. He lifted him into the sky.

As for Chen Tianqi, Luo Tian wasn't worried; Diao Dezhu and the others had already chased after him.

"Swear a blood oath, leave!" Luo Tian spoke softly, standing in the sky like an emperor, making the remaining Eternal Life Mountain people tremble.

"Yes! Yes!" They were overjoyed, quickly swearing a blood oath before scattering. Luo Tian carried the young man and took flight toward Diao Dezhu's direction, leaving a trail of blood...

Chapter 2574: Eliminating Chen Tianqi ()

A streak of light cut through the heavens; Chen Tianqi's forehead dripped sweat as he fled.

"Damn it! If I weren't afraid of Luo Tian, I'd turn back and beat you!" Chen Tianqi cursed inwardly. Behind him were three people, like tails, constantly chasing him no matter where he fled.

"Who are these three?" Chen Tianqi felt委屈, having escaped for an hour. He'd tried to hide his form but was always found by them.

"Old man, I can smell your scent; no matter where you run, I'll find you!" Purple lightning flashed as Diao Dezhu's eyes gleamed with triumph, addressing Chen Tianqi.

"Continuing like this isn't a solution!" Chen Tianqi mused, his speed couldn't shake Diao Dezhu. If Luo Tian joined the chase, he'd be trapped here. With Luo Tian's grudge against Eternal Life Mountain, he wouldn't get a good outcome.

As Chen Tianqi spoke, a divine light flew from afar—Luo Tian had arrived.

"Luo Tian!" Chen Tianqi shivered, again biting his teeth and fleeing. However, Diao Dezhu and the others also saw Luo Tian and followed Chen Tianqi closely.

In an instant, Diao Dezhu caught up with Chen Tianqi, brandishing a purple long sword and slashing toward him.

Diao Dezhu hadn't chased Chen Tianqi before, fearing they couldn't subdue him. Now that Luo Tian had arrived, it was safe.

Purple sword light erupted, a surge of purple qi forming a resounding blade that forced Chen Tianqi to respond.

"An Immortal Peak beginning, dare to act so boldly before me!" Chen Tianqi extended his hand, a green hand grasping the blade.

Crack...

The thunderous sound echoed; after their clash, Diao Dezhu's body retreated but wore a smile. Two strong men had arrived.

"Old man, I'll fight you!" Golden long staff swung down as Yao Chen roared, wielding heavenly might. Chen Tianqi's face changed.

Another green hand formed, grabbing the staff. This time, Chen Tianqi kept retreating, and Yao Chen also flew back, his battle spirit intensifying.

"Old man!" As Chen Tianqi retreated, Chen Zhanbiao attacked like a black tower, his aura fierce. A fist slammed toward Chen Tianqi.

Black fists collided repeatedly, echoing sounds of vacuum rupturing in the heavens. The black fist struck Chen Tianqi's body.

Puk...

Chen Tianqi spat blood, his body like a streak of light flying back thousands of feet. Though severely wounded, he seized the opportunity to flee again.

"I must survive!" Chen Tianqi's heart roared, his speed exploding.

"Zhanbiao, can't you be a little gentler? You've scared them off!" Diao Dezhu scolded, watching Chen Tianqi's direction.

"Chase!" At the same time, Luo Tian arrived, his speed exploding as he chased Chen Tianqi's direction.

The four resumed chasing Chen Tianqi, the scenery beneath them flashing rapidly.

"I am Chen Tianqi of Eternal Life Mountain; who will help me? I'll reward them generously!" Chen Tianqi shouted repeatedly.

But no one answered, as the battle where Luo Tian intercepted Eternal Life Mountain had spread.

Luo Tian had returned to the Middle Three Heavens, and his first move was to kill tens of thousands from Eternal Life Mountain. The remaining were scattered; now they were hunting Chen Tianqi, the sect's elder.

This incident spread across all Middle Three Heavens' sects, causing a massive uproar. Every sect in the Middle Three Heavens trembled.

"Back then, when he died, Tianyuan Sect went mad. Now he's back and caused trouble again!"

"Who dares to help? Only an Immortal Peak end could save him. The Middle Three Heavens have none within the Hundred Sects!"

The entire Middle Three Heavens were in peril. Wherever Chen Tianqi went, sects dared not emerge. Now, neither Luo Tian's strength nor Tianyuan Sect's power would be interfered with.

Flying, Chen Tianqi reached a mountain—Red Dust Sect in the Middle Three Heavens!

When Tianyuan Sect vied for dominance, the Silk Spider Valley was destroyed. Thus, Star River Prefecture ranked second, and Red Dust Sect climbed to third place.

When Meng Hongchen died, Red Dust Sect faced crisis. Perhaps it was fate; the sect's master had breakthroughs.

Though he had broken through, Tianyuan Sect was cleaning up the Middle Three Heavens' sects. When they reached Red Dust Sect, Hell attacked the Immortal Realm, and Tianyuan Sect's armies were redirected to Cang Gate, letting Red Dust Sect escape.

"Please, Red Dust Sect disciples, come and save me!" Chen Tianqi's polite words echoed over Red Dust Sect.

If it were usual, Chen Tianqi would have been arrogant, but now he had to lower himself.

"We don't have our old and new masters here!" Red Dust Sect's elders shouted, their hearts trembling as they saw Chen Tianqi fleeing.

"Damned!"

"They're doing it on purpose; they don't want to help but fear Luo Tian and also fear angering Eternal Life Mountain. After all, Red Dust Sect is the first subordinate force of Eternal Life Mountain!" Chen Tianqi instantly understood.

"Damned! I don't believe you won't come out! If you don't, I'll force you to!" Chen Tianqi's heart seethed. He suddenly stopped over Red Dust Sect.

"What's happening? Why are you stopping here?" Seeing Chen Tianqi stop, Red Dust Sect people were bewildered.

As soon as Chen Tianqi stopped, Luo Tian's group arrived, appearing beside him, gazing at Chen Tianqi.

"Red Dust Sect?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, recalling when Tianyuan Sect had helped Silk Spider Valley attack Tianyuan Sect.

"We've wiped out most of Eternal Life Mountain's forces in the Middle Three Heavens. We planned to attack Red Dust Sect, but Hell attacked the Immortal Realm and delayed us!" Yao Chen addressed Luo Tian.

"This is Red Dust Sect's way of not helping Chen Tianqi; he wants to draw them out for battle." Luo Tian and his group were sharp, understanding Chen Tianqi's plan.

"Perfect; let's finish them together!" Luo Tian muttered, blood sword appearing in his hand. He rushed toward Chen Tianqi.

"Is it really Luo Tian!" Red Dust Sect people erupted in chaos, gazing at the figure cloaked in black mist and cold aura.

The sword cut through space, a blood-colored blade descending swiftly, making Chen Tianqi's face change.

"Still not coming out?" Chen Tianqi gazed at the blood-colored blade, his heart pounding. Yet he still met Luo Tian's attack, knowing only if Red Dust Sect people fought could he have a chance to survive.

A green long sword appeared in Chen Tianqi's hand, raising it to meet Luo Tian's blood sword. A red and green clash in the sky.

Thunderous explosions echoed; Chen Tianqi's body plummeted from the heavens, crashing onto Red Dust Sect's mountain peak.

Boom...

A heavy sound echoed; Chen Tianqi's mouth bled, his body still standing. His feet crushed a mountain peak, which cracked repeatedly.

The peak's buildings shattered in waves; many Red Dust Sect disciples were swept by Chen Tianqi's aura, True Realm disciples turned to blood mist, and True Realm disciples also spat blood.

Chen Tianqi stepped on the ground, taking flight again; he had no choice but to rise because a golden staff swung down.

Chen Tianqi hadn't even left the mountain when the golden staff struck his peak, instantly shattering it.

"We really don't have our old and new masters here!" Red Dust Sect people shouted, some understanding Chen Tianqi's plan.

The battle of an Immortal Peak cultivator was apocalyptic for them. Just those two attacks had annihilated a mountain peak, killing all within. If they continued fighting, Red Dust Sect might be wiped out.

"Evacuate Red Dust Sect!" A senior immediately reacted, his voice trembling with tears. They spoke the truth; both masters were indeed absent from Red Dust Sect, but Chen Tianqi didn't believe it.

Red Dust Sect instantly erupted in chaos; figures fled like mad toward Red Dust Sect's exterior.

Above the heavens, Luo Tian didn't fight with full strength because Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao were attacking Chen Tianqi. He knew they needed to have their fill.

Thunderous explosions echoed continuously, violent waves descending upon Red Dust Sect. Though they had started evacuating, with so many people, it was hard to flee quickly. Soon Red Dust Sect became a wreck, and disciples died under their clash.

"What did we do to deserve this!" Red Dust Sect disciples cried out, it was a sudden disaster.

"Are they really not here?" Chen Tianqi fought while questioning, having placed his life on Red Dust Sect. If they truly weren't there, he'd be left here today.

"Still not coming out?" Chen Tianqi's bitterness grew; being beaten by Luo Tian's group, he was soon wounded. If no one helped, death was inevitable.

Boom Boom Boom...

The thunderous sound continued; after half a hour, Chen Tianqi was reduced to a bloodied figure with multiple broken bones.

Red Dust Sect was also in ruins; the disciples finally evacuated Red Dust Sect, but tens of thousands were buried within their sect.

"Enough!" Luo Tian frowned slightly, watching the sweat-drenched Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao. Though they were top-tier Immortal Peak beginning, fighting an Immortal Peak mid-stage to kill was challenging. Luo Tian's body moved swiftly, encircling Chen Tianqi with a domain that slowed his movements. Yao Chen's staff struck him.

Chapter 2575: Tianyuan Sect Crisis ()

"Everlasting Life Gate!" Chen Tianqi shouted, flying back as he formed a green door that slammed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian faced the Everlasting Life Gate, which had once made him tremble. He rushed forward and punched it.

Crack...

A resounding crack echoed; the mighty Everlasting Life Gate was shattered by Luo Tian's fist. He passed through the storm and appeared before Chen Tianqi, punching him again with eight times his physical strength.

Boom...

Blood mist scattered; one punch to an Immortal Peak mid-stage, sending Chen Tianqi into a blood mist that rained from the sky.

Luo Tian extended his hand, seizing Chen Tianqi's soul and imprinting divine laws to seal it. After all, an Immortal Peak mid-stage soul might have use.

"Who is this? How powerful is Luo Tian?" Red Dust Sect people's faces bore fear, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Are they really not coming out?" Luo Tian and his group stood in the sky, gazing at Red Dust Sect. From start to finish, no one had emerged.

"Where are they? According to logic, they should have appeared. Not even a single word!" Luo Tian's mind puzzled.

"Ask and you'll know!" Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing a half-step Immortal Peak disciple and bringing him before himself.

"Where are your sect masters?" Luo Tian asked, making the half-step Immortal Peak disciple shiver.

"Luo... Master, our two masters have gone to Tianyuan Sect," the half-step Immortal Peak disciple dared not delay, speaking quickly.

"Have they gone to Tianyuan Sect? To threaten Tianyuan Sect?" Hearing the half-step Immortal Peak disciple's words, Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze turning dangerous.

"Luo Master, please have mercy! This is the Nine Immortal Sects' decision; it's not our fault!" The half-step Immortal Peak disciple immediately froze, begging for mercy. He feared Luo Tian would kill him on a whim.

Luo Tian pondered for a while, then tossed the half-step Immortal Peak disciple back to the ground. He gazed at Red Dust Sect's remaining millions and took flight.

"Return to Tianyuan Sect; I'll see which sects in the Middle Three Heavens dare to attack Tianyuan Sect!" Luo Tian's voice was cold.

Diao Dezhu and the others followed Luo Tian toward Tianyuan Sect.

...

Tianyuan Sect, unquestionably the top sect in the Middle Three Heavens. It was vast but had six of its strongest cultivators gathered at Tianlan Sect after heading to Cang Gate.

The sect was still strong, but compared to before, it had some shortcomings.

At that moment, in the main hall of Tianyuan Sect, a group of figures sat there, their faces filled with joy. There were about thirty to forty people—masters of sects.

The leader was three powerful figures, their aura exuding Immortal Peak end. The hall felt unusually heavy.

Behind them sat the masters of the Middle Three Heavens, their faces filled with mockery as they gazed at Jiang Sixi and Nan Gong Yuqing.

"They've had their day; now they've angered the Nine Immortal Sects!" They thought internally.

Tianyuan Sect had cleansed the Middle Three Heavens' sects, making them fear being caught.

"May I ask what the purpose of your visit to Tianyuan Sect is?" Jiang Sixi, a woman, bore an imperial aura. She faced three Immortal Peak end masters without expression.

Behind her sat Xiang Tianming, Huo Zhu Meng Wushuang, and Lu Chong. Three Immortal Peak end masters. Then came Nan Gong Yuqing and other Immortal Peak beginning masters.

"Starting today, Tianyuan Sect must retreat one mile at Cang Gate; if they don't, ten thousand will die. This is the decision of several peak Immortal Sects!" An old man spoke, wearing Eternal Life Mountain's robe. His gaze was cold.

The old man's side also had an Immortal Peak end master, one from East Emperor Sect and another from Ghost King Sect. Their aura was formidable.

"You dare?" Jiang Sixi coldly replied, clenching her fists.

"You can try to see if we dare. Also, three days from now, if they don't start fighting, ten thousand will die daily!" The old man's face showed disdain. A young girl at Immortal Peak beginning, he hadn't taken her seriously.

No one in Tianyuan Sect could threaten him. As for the person who had escaped from Eternal Life Immortal Peak, they'd already checked; he hadn't appeared in Tianyuan Sect for three years.

The Immortal Peak end of Tianyuan Sect, Xiang Tianming, he also hadn't taken him seriously. He could sense Xiang Tianming's aura was unstable, clearly newly entered into Immortal Peak end. They had three Immortal Peak end masters here.

Buzz...

As everyone sat there, waves rose on their bodies. They all took out their identity tokens to check.

"What?" Their faces changed slightly upon seeing the token.

"Luo Tian has returned to the Immortal Realm? And he killed Eternal Life Mountain's elder, Chen Tianqi!"

"Chen Tianqi lured Luo Tian to Red Dust Sect; tens of thousands of Red Dust Sect disciples died!" Messages spread instantly into each master's ears, making their faces slightly change.

"Luo Tian!" The three Immortal Peak end masters also received the news, their brows furrowed.

"He dares to return? And upon returning, he killed tens of thousands from Eternal Life Mountain, one Immortal Peak mid-stage and another Immortal Peak end, plus tens of thousands from Red Dust Sect!" The hall erupted in chaos; people turned their gazes to the three Immortal Peak end masters.

"Lao Chu, how do you handle this?" The East Emperor Sect's Immortal Peak end master smiled slightly and addressed the Eternal Life Mountain's Immortal Peak end master.

Chu Kaihe's face was dark, his eyes flashing with killing intent as he gazed at Jiang Sixi and others.

"Luo Tian, who killed my Eternal Life Mountain's people. Come forth! Kill ten thousand Tianyuan Sect disciples!" Chu Kaihe ordered the people from Eternal Life Mountain.

"Yes!" An Immortal Peak beginning master stepped out of the hall.

"You dare!" Jiang Sixi slammed her seat and stood up, her people's gazes coldly looking at the people leaving the hall.

"Only you?"
