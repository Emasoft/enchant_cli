“Haha, mere ants! For immortality, I would forsake them!” Yang Huan Yu’s face bore contempt as he extended his hand toward the void.

At this moment, the two thousand to three thousand half-step World Emperor cultivators locked in battle with the masters of Tianyuan Continent suddenly bore expressions of agony, their eyes wide with disbelief as they gazed at Yang Huan Yu.

“Master!” The cultivators of the Wangyue Sect cried out, their gazes filled with shock as they looked at Yang Huan Yu.

“Flee! They are about to self-destruct!” The masters of Tianyuan Continent felt the terrifying fluctuations emanating from their opponents and recoiled in fear.

The self-destruction of a half-step World Emperor cultivator could obliterate them entirely, even inflicting grievous wounds upon those of the World Emperor realm.

“Flee!” The people of Tianyuan Continent scattered instantly, their faces etched with terror as they entered the array set by Jiang Nanxuan.

Moreover, they pooled their strength to erect countless barriers outside the array, awaiting the impending catastrophe.

Luotian furrowed his brow and flashed forward to join Zhang Daotian, the Demon Lord, and four others. The澎湃 of Primordial Chaos Power coalesced into a gray sphere, encircling the five within its core.

The five World Emperor cultivators of Wangyue Sect, however, bore complex expressions as they gazed at Yang Huan Yu. They had never imagined he would reach such a level, compelling their lifelong subordinates to self-destruct.

“Peng…” Under the multifaceted gazes of the people, a half-step World Emperor cultivator’s cultivation power erupted into a terrifying fluctuation, sweeping across the heavens and earth.

“One… ten… a hundred…” As if triggered by a chain reaction, the two thousand to three thousand half-step World Emperor cultivators detonated like firecrackers.

“Boom…!” A terrifying fluctuation rose beyond the Western Regions, forming a monstrous storm that lowered the ground by three inches under its oppressive might.

A ten-zhang-long gray storm surged skyward, piercing through the heavens with unrelenting force.

“Such power—even I would not emerge unscathed!” Luotian and Zhang Daotian, positioned less than a thousand zhang away from the self-destruction’s force, were still caught in its waves. The gray barriers trembled with resounding roars.

“Something’s wrong! Why is this self-destruction not aimed at us, but the void?” Xiang Tianming spoke up, causing Luotian and his companions to startle.

“It’s the Reincarnation Passage!” The Demon Lord’s face darkened with fury as he gazed at the colossal Reincarnation Passage suspended in the void.

“He intends to shatter the Reincarnation Passage!” They finally understood Yang Huan Yu’s intent.

Previously, Jiang Nanxuan had summoned the Reincarnation Passage to draw the souls of Tianyuan’s people into reincarnation, preventing them from being devoured by Yang Huan Yu.

If the Reincarnation Passage were shattered, chaos would ensue—souls could not enter reincarnation, and souls from other realms might spill into Tianyuan, plunging it into turmoil.

Yet Luotian and his companions could only watch helplessly; the self-destruction of thousands of half-step World Emperors was beyond their power to stop.

“Crack…” Thunder rumbled as, in awe-struck gazes, the immense self-destruction force finally collided with the gray Reincarnation Passage.

The void collapsed, and the colossal passage fractured under the self-destruction’s force, with gray energy swirling around it.

For over a dozen breaths, the self-destruction force faded from Luotian’s perception. In its wake, the Reincarnation Passage lay shattered above them, with countless gray souls escaping from its broken aperture.

After channeling the combined strength of all Tianyuan’s sects, the Reincarnation Passage was shattered. The long-lost souls, now homeless, surged toward Yang Huan Yu’s terrifying suction.

“Damn it!” Luotian roared, his body surging skyward toward Yang Huan Yu. The Demon Lord and others followed suit.

At this moment, the Wangyue Sect had no remaining troops—only Yang Huan Yu and five elder World Emperors.

“For immortality! For immortality!” The five Wangyue Sect elders bore grotesque expressions, recalling Yang Huan Yu’s cruelty. They steeled themselves and charged toward Zhang Daotian’s group.

“Now it falls to them!” Gu Qianxue watched the battle above, her face etched with unease. Among them were her brother Gu Lei and Luotian’s beloved, filling her with worry.

“Die!” Luotian knew this was a battle to the death; if Yang Huan Yu’s soul also reached the Supreme Realm, they would have no hope. Though Luotian sensed that the Supreme Realm could not exist on Tianyuan, even a suppressed Supreme Realm was beyond their capacity to oppose.

“Haha! My subordinates will not die in vain!” Yang Huan Yu’s body was enveloped by swirling gray energy. Most souls bore confusion, while a few glared with endless hatred, lunging toward him.

“Before death, I feared you not—now as souls, do you think you can harm me?” Yang Huan Yu sneered, his body radiating an immense suction that devoured the gray souls without a trace.

At the same time, Luotian’s sharp spear pierced the void and struck Yang Huan Yu’s front.

“Peng…” The spear of Ruptured Heaven clashed with the Halberd of Profound Darkness, and the two clashed repeatedly in the void.

The sky over the Western Regions echoed with thunderous roars, though no longer an army of millions. Only Luotian and his companions clashed repeatedly, their commotion rivaling that of the earlier battlefield.

The people of Tianyuan gazed with anticipation at Luotian’s group, sensing the decisive moment had arrived.

Chapter 737: Seven Inches

Chapter 737: Seven Inches

The Western Regions of Tianyuan.

Terrifying fluctuations echoed over the Western Regions, rendering it beyond description as a wasteland. The battle of World Emperor cultivators had lowered the land by several zhang, and this was only due to Luotian’s combat high above.

“Increasingly powerful!” Luotian panted, his gaze heavy as he stared at Yang Huan Yu’s calm face.

Luotian felt Yang Huan Yu growing stronger with each soul absorbed.

Then, Luotian gazed at the shattered Reincarnation Passage below, his face etched with urgency. The number of souls had grown exponentially, and the red seals continued to kill, drawing nearly all of Tianyuan’s souls into the Western Regions.

As time passed, the strength of the souls emerging from the Reincarnation Passage increased. Though Luotian and his companions were unafraid, others on Tianyuan would not remain unaffected.

“Luotian, what more can you fight me with?” Yang Huan Yu barked, sensing his growing strength. He would soon enter the Supreme Realm—though suppressed by Tianyuan’s laws, it would be a half-step Supreme Realm. Yet still, it was the realm Yang Huan Yu had long yearned for.

“Let us decide this!” Luotian knew he could no longer delay, his mind set. His hands shifted.

“Human King’s Seal!” A five-colored seal, glowing with radiance, materialized above Luotian. Simultaneously, his right hand凝聚 the Soul-Stealing Seal.

With a half-step Supreme Realm’s cultivation, Luotian’s two techniques formed seamlessly. The Royal Seal merged with the Heaven-Opening Seal, which pierced the void and fused into the Royal Seal.

“Wu…” The Five Elements’ fluctuations spread over the Western Regions, causing Zhang Daotian and others to tremble.

“Is Luotian about to use that technique?” Gu Lei’s face bore fear. Though he had now reached the World Emperor realm, recalling how Luotian had unleashed this technique in the Xianggu Ruins with his soul at the peak of cultivation, he instinctively shuddered.

“Flee…” Gu Lei did not hesitate, transmitting a mental message to Zhang Daotian and the Demon Lord. He闪身 away from his opponent, joining Tianyuan’s side.

Zhang Daotian and others moved swiftly, sensing Gu Lei’s mental transmission was no jest. They abandoned their opponents, returning to protect the masses of Tianyuan.

“What’s happening?” The five World Emperor cultivators of Wangyue Sect, however, bore puzzled expressions. Though the fusion of Luotian’s three techniques was formidable, it did not yet threaten a World Emperor. They could not fathom why Zhang Daotian and others had retreated.

“Hmph…” Yang Huan Yu furrowed his brow, equally puzzled. A strange sense of danger stirred within him. To be cautious, he swiftly shifted his hands, forming a terrifying pressure in his grasp—intending to unleash his strongest technique, even if it meant blocking Luotian’s attack.

“Kill…” Yang Huan Yu’s remaining five World Emperor cultivators ignored all, seeing their opponents flee. They surged toward the masses of Tianyuan.

“Return!” Luotian let out a light laugh, his entire body radiating Primordial Chaos Power. It coalesced into a sphere and surged into the golden seal above the sky.

“Wu…” A terrifying pressure spread across the Western Regions, its destructive force surpassing even Yang Huan Yu’s initial destruction energy by more than double.

Meanwhile, the five World Emperor cultivators who had aimed for Tianyuan froze, their faces finally revealing terror as they gazed at the monstrous seal above.

At this moment, the five World Emperor cultivators finally understood why Gu Lei and Zhang Daotian had fled.

When Luotian had been at the peak of his soul cultivation, he had unleashed this three-element fusion combined with Primordial Chaos Power. It had made even the soul of a World Emperor’s domain tremble. Now, with Luotian’s strength far beyond his former self, a half-step World Emperor—Luotian was arguably the strongest on Tianyuan.

“Primordial Chaos Seal!” Luotian roared, naming this terrifying seal.

Faced with such overwhelming pressure, the five World Emperor cultivators bore fear and attempted to flee. Yet in this oppressive force, their movements slowed to a crawl.

“Destruction Dragon!” Yang Huan Yu, now somewhat fearful, barked, gazing at the gray seal above. His hands formed a dragon of destruction energy, which roared and surged toward Luotian’s Primordial Chaos Seal.

“Die!” Luotian laughed, the gray seal radiating immense might as if it could crush the entire sky of the Western Regions. It smashed toward Yang Huan Yu and the five World Emperor cultivators with unrelenting force.

“Peng…” The gray dragon collided with Luotian’s Primordial Chaos Seal, producing a thunderous roar. Even those outside the Western Regions felt their blood churn; only Zhang Daotian and others of the World Emperor realm fared slightly better.

The fluctuation was no less than that of two thousand half-step World Emperors’ self-destruction, sweeping again over the Western Regions and rendering it even more desolate.

“Not yet finished!” Yang Huan Yu’s gaze darkened, his face etched with solemnity as he gazed at the storm caused by the technique.

“Wu…” A wave of pressure spread through the fluctuation. Under Luotian’s slightly upturned lips, a gray seal broke through the storm and pressed toward Yang Huan Yu.

“Damn it! What is this thing!” The five World Emperor cultivators were utterly stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They could not fathom that Yang Huan Yu’s full-force strike had failed to stop Luotian’s terrifying seal.

“Thousand zhang… hundred zhang…” The gray seal arrived in an instant, and as it neared, the five World Emperor cultivators were enveloped by a deathly crisis.

“Defend!” The five World Emperor cultivators and Yang Huan Yu raised their hands, enveloping the six in an endless destruction energy.

“Crack…” The destruction energy barrier had barely formed when the Primordial Chaos Seal smashed into it, producing a crisp sound.

Dust filled the air; the ground beneath the seal began to crack, revealing a blackened pit that extended until it reached the feet of Tianyuan’s people.

“My heavens, this strike has destroyed nearly a fifth of the Western Regions!” Zheng Xin’s face bore awe as she gazed at Luotian above.

The people of Tianyuan wore expressions of excitement, feeling the immense power beneath Luotian’s technique. Even World Emperor cultivators would not survive!

“Roar…” The people of Tianyuan continuously roared, shouting Luotian’s name.

“Not dead yet!” Luotian panted, gazing at the inky black pit. A gust of wind swept past his ears.

Six battered figures emerged from the black pit, their clothes torn and blood oozing from their mouths, staining their attire.

“Not dead!” As the six appeared, the cheers of Tianyuan’s people abruptly ceased. Their faces bore disbelief as they gazed at the six battered figures above.

Yang Huan Yu stood before them, his face twisted in grimace as he stared at Luotian. The five World Emperor cultivators behind him, however, bore fear.

In that moment, the five had truly felt death’s proximity. Had it not been for Yang Huan Yu and their combined efforts, they would have perished.

Even now, they lacked the strength to fight again, standing silently behind Yang Huan Yu, too afraid to act.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve grown so strong!” Yang Huan Yu clearly bore injuries; had it not been for his Supreme Realm body, he might have fared no better than his five subordinates.

“Now you’ve likely exhausted yourself. It’s time to end this—prepare for death!” Luotian wore a faint expression of melancholy as he gazed at Yang Huan Yu.

From the day they met in the Five Elements Sect, they had been destined as enemies. After a decade of enmity, today’s resolution would leave Luotian in awe.

“Do you remember what I once said? You cannot kill me!” Yang Huan Yu wiped blood from his lips, a faint smile on his face. He bore no fear as he gazed at Luotian.

“Kill!” Luotian had no patience for further words, his body flashing forward as nine-colored light surged toward Yang Huan Yu.

Seeing Luotian charge, Yang Huan Yu let out a light laugh. He extended his hand, and a wisp of gray energy appeared before him, forming into a humanoid figure with a bewildered face.

At the moment this gray soul appeared, the nine-colored light abruptly halted. Luotian’s body froze, his heart jolted as he gazed at the gray figure in Yang Huan Yu’s grasp.

“How? Luotian, do you still recognize her? I know you are sentimental; surely you haven’t forgotten!” Yang Huan Yu spoke softly, holding the gray soul in his hand. With a slight squeeze, he could crush it.

“Chen Yunting!” Luotian’s eyes brimmed with boundless excitement, as if he had not heard Yang Huan Yu at all. His gaze fixated on the gray soul in Yang Huan Yu’s grasp.

“Enough! Just stay there and do not move. When the time comes, I shall return this girl’s soul to you!” Yang Huan Yu, having found Luotian’s weakness, wore a playful expression as he spoke.

Chapter 738: Opening of the Epoch

Chapter 738: Opening of the Epoch

The Western Regions.

A blood-red moon hung high in the sky, casting countless red seals like raindrops from above. These seals harvested the lives of Tianyuan’s commoners and cultivators, sending countless souls toward the Western Regions. The area turned gray and crimson.

Luotian stood above, his face etched with sorrow as he gazed at the gray soul a thousand zhang away. He finally let go of his longing, gritting his teeth as he stared at Yang Huan Yu.

“Stay still!” Yang Huan Yu smiled, standing above the sky. A powerful suction radiated from him, drawing a fifth of the blood energy absorbed by the Epoch Book. This energy surged into Yang Huan Yu’s body.

As blood energy entered his body, Yang Huan Yu’s wounds healed at an astonishing rate. With each soul absorbed, his power grew stronger, nearing the threshold of the World Emperor realm.

“Luotian, kill him! As for Chen Yunting, we can deal with it later!” Yin Tianxiong’s voice rang out, laced with urgency as he addressed Luotian.

Luotian’s face darkened. Chen Yunting had always been a knot in his heart, a decade-long one. Now that he saw the other half of her soul, if he could obtain it, his heart’s knot would be fully untied.

On the other hand, countless beings of Tianyuan could not allow Yang Huan Yu to succeed. If he did, Gu Qianxue would die, friends would perish, brothers-in-arms would fall, and even his master would meet death. Everyone would die!

“Forgive me, Yunting. I swear, even if your soul is scattered to the winds, I will gather it and return it to you. Wait for me!” Luotian gently touched his waist’s soul-rearing jade, his eyes soft. His body flashed like lightning, and two tears slipped down his cheeks.

“Wu…” A subtle fluctuation emanated from the soul-rearing jade at his waist, sending a mental message into Luotian’s mind.

“Too late!” Yang Huan Yu smiled, and in a brief moment, his strength had recovered significantly.

“Luotian, too late! We shall meet in the Immortal Realm. As for this little girlfriend of yours, heh—he no longer has any need to keep her!” Yang Huan Yu’s face twisted in grimace, his hatred for Luotian reaching its peak. He had spent years meticulously planning, and now it was all undone by Luotian.

“Peng…” A crisp sound echoed as the gray soul transformed into a wisp of energy, drifting through the heavens and earth.

“No!” Luotian’s eyes widened in despair. Though he had made his decision, the reality before him was too much to bear.

“Boom…” Luotian’s body became狂暴, his roar shaking the sky. His eyes turned blood-red, and an overwhelming aura formed around him.

“I want you dead… I want you dead!” Luotian roared, forming countless void cracks around him. Fiery light surrounded his body as he took seven steps to seal the heavens.

Luotian’s speed was极致, surpassing time itself. In a brief moment, he appeared before Yang Huan Yu, launching attacks of “Purge Life” and “Rebirth,” like a storm.

Yang Huan Yu bore a mocking expression, his strength having recovered fivefold. He gazed at Luotian with hatred, his body radiating destruction energy as he punched forward. The two clashed again in the sky.

Tremendous fluctuations formed around them, and they seemed like sovereigns of the world, disappearing from sight. The Western Regions became their battlefield, and this fight would determine Tianyuan’s fate.

“Primordial Chaos Seal!” Luotian roared, his nine meridians radiating boundless light. Terror-filled energy coalesced on his hands, while three souls and a soul-essence凝聚 into an immense soul-stealing seal above his head.

“Another one?” Yang Huan Yu’s face bore a hint of fear. He was unsure if his current state could withstand Luotian’s Primordial Chaos Seal again.

Yet Luotian seemed疯狂, holding nothing back. The disappearance of half of Chen Yunting’s soul had left him in unbearable pain.

“Wu…” A massive pressure rose over the Western Regions, and the gray Primordial Chaos Seal formed again under people’s fearful gazes. Its power was even stronger than before.

“Hold on!” Yang Huan Yu knew this was a life-or-death moment. If he could not withstand the Primordial Chaos Seal, his millennia-long plan would be ruined.

Ignoring the cost, he spat out three drops of blood, which transformed into a torrent of cultivation energy entering his body. Feeling it was still insufficient, he merged three more drops, and his power briefly returned to its peak. His hands moved swiftly, forming the Soul-Devouring Cauldron, which radiated immense pressure in his grasp.

“Go…” Both techniques formed simultaneously without hesitation, flying toward each other.

“Wu…” Two terrifying techniques surged with overwhelming might, colliding head-on—this was Luotian and Yang Huan Yu’s final strike, determining the battle’s outcome.

“Wu…” Just as the two techniques were about to collide, the Epoch Book floating in the sky emitted a fierce roar. It had absorbed enough blood energy and now radiated an immense red light, sending a tremendous pressure over the Western Regions.

“Boom…!” The thunderous roar echoed as the Primordial Chaos Seal and Yang Huan Yu’s Soul-Devouring Cauldron collided. The Western Regions relived the previous scene.

“Crack…” The barriers protecting Tianyuan’s people could not withstand the consecutive fluctuations, emitting a series of cracks and vanishing into the air.

Dust filled the sky, obscuring people’s vision. Even Zhang Daotian and others of the World Emperor realm could not discern what was happening at the explosion’s center.

Thirty breaths passed, and Tianyuan’s people felt it was like a day. When the dust cleared, Luotian and Yang Huan Yu’s bodies were revealed.

At this moment, they no longer stood in the sky but had fallen to the ground, their faces filled with hatred as they gazed at each other.

“It’s over!” Luotian rose, slowly approaching Yang Huan Yu, who was at his weakest.

“It’s not over! Because the time has come!” Yang Huan Yu smiled playfully, his trembling hand pointing toward the blood-red Epoch Book above.

Following Yang Huan Yu’s gaze, Luotian looked at the Epoch Book and furrowed his brow. Yet his desire to kill Yang Huan Yu outweighed his curiosity.

The Ruptured Heaven Spear flew into Luotian’s hand, and without hesitation, he stabbed toward Yang Huan Yu, who was burning his blood and at his weakest.

“Wu…” But just as the spear’s tip was about to touch Yang Huan Yu, a massive pressure filled the world, causing Luotian’s body to freeze in shock.

“Epoch Book! Open it—Immortal Realm!” Yang Huan Yu’s face twisted in madness as he gazed at the Epoch Book.

To his sight, the Epoch Book soared skyward, its body expanding rapidly from a small size. Endless blood energy surrounded it, and an immense pressure swept over Tianyuan’s people, making them feel difficulty in breathing.

“Ten zhang… hundred zhang… thousand zhang…” Under Luotian’s awe, the Epoch Book expanded to a thousand zhang in size, resembling the ancient Xianggu Dao Sect.

“Rustle…” The massive pages flipped continuously, and as they turned, a fierce wind swept over the people. Like the winds of Jifeng Valley, it appeared across the Western Regions, with countless goose-feather-like void cracks surrounding them.

Time passed swiftly. Under people’s watchful eyes, the Epoch Book finally turned to its final page.

“Done!” Zhang Daotian and others wore grim faces as they gazed at the Epoch Book above.

“What’s wrong? The ancestor of Wangyue Sect said that opening the Epoch Book would activate the legendary Immortal Realm, right?” Gu Lei and others asked, their faces filled with confusion as they looked at Zhang Daotian.

“Immortal Realm? Previously, Wangyue Sect had sacrificed souls from the Xianggu Continent. Now, seven-tenths of Tianyuan’s beings have been sacrificed! What do you think needs so much blood to activate?” Zhang Daotian’s voice was like a bucket of cold water, extinguishing the dream of immortality in their hearts.

Upon hearing Zhang Daotian’s words, people suddenly realized. If so much blood was needed to activate it, the opening might not be the legendary Immortal Realm but rather an evil seal being released.

“Wu…” Endless blood energy surged out, like a sea of blood pouring from the Epoch Book.

“Haha! It seems my arrangements were not in vain! Who opened the door to my Netherworld across realms?” A deep laugh echoed, accompanied by a massive pressure.

“Roar…” A low roar sounded, and an immense killing intent emanated from the Epoch Book.

“Four Supreme Beings sealed my Netherworld before. Now that I’ve emerged, I shall wreak havoc on your realms and make them blood-soaked to avenge my millennia of imprisonment!” A deep voice echoed, causing the people of Tianyuan to tremble.

“Supreme Realm!” Luotian’s face darkened, sensing the roaring and authoritative voice from within the Epoch Book.

“Hmph…” Yang Huan Yu’s face also shifted slightly, a bad premonition stirring in his heart. He gazed at the middle-aged man in black imperial robes emerging from the Epoch Book.

Chapter 739: Eternal Sealing

Chapter 739: Eternal Sealing

The Western Regions of Tianyuan.

The golden Epoch Book opened like a gate, blood oceans continuously flowing out, causing the people of Tianyuan to bear expressions of fear.

As blood oceans flowed out, countless beings and monsters emerged from the blood seas, kneeling before the man in imperial robes with reverence. Yet their eyes glowed with bloodlust, looking at Tianyuan’s people like prey.

“Ah? The Tianyuan Continent? I never expected it to be the final destination! Good, though its rules are low and cannot reach the Supreme Realm, it is sufficient for me!” The man in imperial robes gazed coldly, muttering as his Supreme Realm aura gradually declined under Tianyuan’s rules.

“Damn it! Why didn’t the Epoch Book open to activate the Immortal Realm?” Yang Huan Yu’s face bore resentment. His years of meticulous planning had led to this unexpected outcome.

“Who released me from the Netherworld? So much blood energy—this will restore my strength!” The man in imperial robes smiled, his face filled with ecstasy as he inhaled deeply. A vast amount of blood energy entered his body with each breath.

“Good, I never expected the Tianyuan Continent to have become this way. It’s a suitable place for me to settle!” The man in imperial robes surveyed the surroundings, finally setting his gaze on Luotian and Yang Huan Yu.

“Good, I suppose you two are the strongest in this continent. Submit to me or die!” The man in imperial robes gazed at Luotian and Yang Huan Yu, speaking softly as he extended his hand.

“Peng…” With a single strike, the five remaining World Emperor cultivators of Yang Huan Yu were instantly turned into blood mist and absorbed into the man’s body.

Luotian broke out in cold sweat, gazing at the man in imperial robes. The moment he appeared, Luotian felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness.

“Definitely not a single-source Supreme Realm!” Though Luotian did not know what the Supreme Realm felt like, he could sense this man was definitely not a single-source Supreme Realm. Even some of his subordinates were likely not single-source Supreme Realms—this mysterious and soul-piercing pressure made Luotian fear.

Yet he guessed these beings were likely sealed for too long, and their true strength had not fully recovered. Otherwise, the people of Tianyuan would have already been prostrate before them, including himself.

“Those who could cultivate to half-step Supreme Realm in this continent are truly gifted! Submit to me, and I shall guide you to the pinnacle of cultivation!” Seeing Luotian and Yang Huan Yu’s fear, the man in imperial robes seemed to enjoy it.

Luotian furrowed his brow. These beings were clearly no good, and he would never submit to them.

Yang Huan Yu’s face was dark with despair, even a shade of gray. His years of planning had ultimately become another’s means to escape, leaving him unable to accept it.

“Go! My children, cleanse this continent and restore your strength. I shall lead you to destroy the Four Supreme Realms and wreak havoc across them! No one will stop us this time!” The man in imperial robes smiled, addressing his subordinates.

“Roar…” The monsters and beings behind the man in imperial robes bore excitement, transforming into streaks of light as they flew toward all directions of Tianyuan.

“This scene is so familiar!” Zhang Daotian’s aged face shed tears, recalling the massacre of the Xianggu Continent.

“What should we do?” Seeing the monsters scatter, Yaozun’s face bore anxiety as he transmitted a mental message to Zhang Daotian and Luotian.

“There’s no resistance! These beings are too strong—each one is not much weaker than Luotian, and some are even stronger! If it weren’t for Tianyuan’s rules restraining them, one of them could annihilate the entire continent!” Yin Tianxiong’s face bore sorrow. He knew Tianyuan was doomed.

“I have a plan! Rather than sit and wait, let’s take a risk!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore contemplation as he transmitted a mental message to Luotian and others.

After a brief exchange, Jiang Nanxuan’s plan brightened their eyes.

“What do you think? Have you decided? Submit to me or perish with these废物!” The man in imperial robes bore impatience, gazing at Luotian and Yang Huan Yu.

“Not possible!” Luotian’s voice carried urgency, ignoring the man’s threat and transmitting his words into their minds.

“Not possible? You must! I am your master! Listen to me!”

“Yes, I am your father. Listen to me… I am your grandfather’s grandfather. Your grandfather listened to me, so you must too!”

“Luotian, rely on you!” The people of Tianyuan wore smiles as they gazed at Luotian above.

“Then I shall begin first!” Zhang Daotian smiled, his expression seemingly one of relief. His hands shifted, and the澎湃 of Primordial Chaos Power burst forth from his body, surging toward Luotian.

“Luotian, I have never properly taught you. You are good; I am proud to have such disciples!” Zhang Daotian smiled, his body’s Primordial Chaos Power fully released. He addressed Luotian, Zhang Daotian, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen, holding a formation flag in his hand as he stood in the void.

“Hmph! Still want to resist? Truly unaware of death. Today, I shall show you what despair is!” The man in imperial robes did not stop them at all. To him, the people of Tianyuan were mere ants—no matter how much they struggled, it would not harm a single dragon.

“Good luck, kid!” Yin Tianxiong smiled, as did Zhang Daotian. His body’s Primordial Chaos Power slowly flowed toward Luotian.

Yaozun let out a light laugh, his staff pointing forward. The Primordial Chaos Power merged with Zhang Daotian and Yin Tianxiong’s power.

“Kid, I said you’d have bad luck. Now it’s even worse—your hard-earned Primordial Chaos Power is gone, and you’ll have to sacrifice your old life!” Xiang Tianming transformed into a Kunpeng bird, his voice laced with无奈. He exhaled, filling the air with gray mist.

Gu Lei, Long Jie, and Jiang Nanxuan also did the same, their newly ascended World Emperor Primordial Chaos Power flowing out.

Six streams of Primordial Chaos Power, like a small stream, flowed toward Luotian.

Luotian’s eyes moistened; he had participated in the discussion and knew what they were about to do.

“Tian, take care of yourself!” Luonantian and Zhang Qiuyue wore expressions of filial love. Both had grasped a fragment of Primordial Chaos Power, and they extracted it to join the small stream.

“Luotian, rely on you! If you fail, we can only be brothers in the next life!” Zheng Xin smiled, holding hands with Danyu Yan. The two’s Primordial Chaos Power flowed out.

“Wait for you!” Leng Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue wore gentle expressions, standing on the ground. Their Primordial Chaos Power flowed out as their eyes locked onto Luotian, as if trying to etch his image into their hearts.

“Luotian, good luck!” Tian Luo, Xu Liyiyi, Chen Zhanbiao, and others—each familiar face—smiled as they released their cultivated Primordial Chaos Power.

“Hmph… interesting…” The man in imperial robes smiled, watching the flowing Primordial Chaos Power. He did not stop it but instead bore a curious expression as he gazed at Luotian.

“Ten… hundred…” Countless gray mists flowed into the sky, eventually converging together.
