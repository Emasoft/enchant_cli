“Senior Long, are you coming in for a visit or heading back?” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed Long Li.

“Apologies, Senior Luo!” At this moment, Long Li could no longer fathom Luo Tian's strength, convinced that he must be a disciple of some great figure. His heart also secretly regretted not aiding Luo Tian from the start.

Yet, Long Li was secretly grateful for having such a fine daughter. The relationship between Long Youran and Luo Tian was clearly different.

“Come on, father, I'm telling you—this is my territory!” Upon hearing Long Li intended to enter the mountain stronghold, Long Youran's face lit up with excitement. She grabbed Long Li’s arm without even acknowledging Luo Tian, and they both stepped into the stronghold.

“Alright, Dahu, Erniu, find three people to send word to the three cities. Have them bring offerings for their ransom. As for the price, say it depends on how much those city lords value themselves!” Luo Tian ignored Long Youran and instructed Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu.

In the grand hall of deliberations, Luo Tian sat at the head. Long Li and his daughter sat before him. Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Long Li.

“Senior Long, in the future, my Tianyuan Sect will need your care,” Luo Tian said softly. Given Long Youran’s connection, he was far more courteous.

“Senior Luo, what do you mean? At your age, to possess such strength—this is unprecedented. I wonder where you hail from?” Long Li asked, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Forgive me, but I cannot reveal that to you,” Luo Tian shook his head gently. His eyes held a hidden meaning as he gazed at Long Li.

“Haha… if you’re unwilling to say, then so be it!” Seeing Luo Tian’s gaze, Long Li immediately understood. Disciples of major sects often refrain from revealing their origins during trials.

“By the way, Senior Luo, be cautious of Xiulong City’s retaliation. Though Li Xiulong is dead, there remains a Second-Rank Immortal Alchemist named Li Tianxiao. His network is vast, and he’s a far more terrifying figure than Li Xiulong,” Long Li warned Luo Tian.

“Troublesome!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, a hint of impatience in his gaze. Yet he soon let out a cold laugh.

“If they dare come, I’ll make them walk the same path as Li Xiulong!” Luo Tian sneered. He thought of his newly crafted Break Immortal Pill. Once fully refined, he could ascend to the Heavenly Sage realm. At that point, no one in these cities would be his match.

In truth, the greatest fear was Tianmen Sect. Zhu Fenghuo’s elder brother—calculating the time, if he had learned of this, and was a Heavenly Sage, he should have already arrived.

“Ascend to the Heavenly Sage realm—everything will be settled. If worst comes to worst, I’ll just flee!” Luo Tian muttered quietly before chatting with Long Li for a while. Then he escorted them down the mountain.

“Back to seclusion!” After seeing them off, Luo Tian made no hesitation and returned to his cave.

“This time, I’ll break through to the Heavenly Sage realm!” Luo Tian muttered quietly. He raised his hand and placed a golden pill into his mouth.

“Boom…” Instantly, violent immortal energy surged within Luo Tian’s body. His face twisted in pain.

“Crack… crack…” A series of sharp cracks echoed from Luo Tian’s body. Cracks formed across his skin, and immortal energy burst forth through them.

“This elixir is truly potent…” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, then began to refine it.

At the same time, a crimson-clad figure entered Xiulong City with a sly smile.

“First, I’ll gather some information,” the crimson figure flickered and vanished from sight.

Meanwhile, in Xiulong City, an elderly man in white robes stared with a gaze so intense it seemed to bleed. His face bore sorrow.

“Luo Tian, for killing my nephew, I’ll make you pay with your life. I’ll destroy the Tianyuan Sect and slaughter all your kin!” The old man was Li Tianxiao, the only Second-Rank Immortal Alchemist among the five cities. He was also Li Xiulong’s uncle.

As time passed, news of Luo Tian’s battle with the four city lords and the capture of three city lords spread. The five cities erupted in shock.

“How could it be? That Tianyuan Sect leader, no matter how powerful he is, how could he fight four at once? Does he think the city lords are made of paper?” When the news first spread, some scoffed.

“Exactly! Don’t be so full of yourself!” Most people dismissed it as Tianyuan Sect’s boasting.

However, when Zhang Fangfeng, Zhang Lie, and Sun Luocheng’s families arrived with lavish gifts to head toward Tianyuan Sect, people grew surprised.

Chapter 1771: Blood Demon

“Indeed, they were taken!” Everyone was puzzled as the city lords’ families hurriedly exited their gates toward Tianyuan Sect.

“My heavens, this Luo Tian is even more formidable than Zhu Fenghuo. He’s captured several city lords and made their families bring offerings for ransom!” Everyone was stunned.

The three city lords were renowned figures. Not only were their strengths at the Daoist realm, but they also had connections with sects. Few dared to provoke them. Even Zhu Fenghuo only targeted Long Li’s daughter secretly, avoiding direct confrontation with Long Li. Yet now someone dared to kidnap several city lords.

As events unfolded, another shocking revelation spread: Li Xiulong was killed by Luo Tian’s mountain bandit with two punches, and his inferior immortal artifact, the Zhenxian Brush, was seized.

“That’s Li Xiulong! Nearly the top city among five. Second-Rank Immortal Alchemist, and Li Tianxiao’s nephew.

Li Tianxiao was the pillar of Xiulong City. His strength was formidable, nearly at the Heavenly Sage realm. His network was vast, even earning respect from sect elders.

“Who is this Luo Tian? He’s been so mysterious. But now he’s pulled off such a massive move!” People kept discussing.

“Could he be an apprentice from the Nine Immortal Mountains?” As time passed, people began to speculate.

“Possibly. Otherwise, who else would dare offend so many? His backer must be a major force!”

“With such astonishing strength and no fear of anyone, besides the Nine Immortal Mountains’ disciples, I can’t think of who else would have such confidence!” As people’s suspicions grew, they soon pinned Luo Tian’s identity on the Nine Immortal Mountains.

“Did you hear? That Luo Tian is a direct disciple of the Tianji Immortal King…”

“Lies, I heard he’s the illegitimate son of the Yaowang Sect, Changsheng Immortal King!”

“Lies again. According to reliable sources, this Luo Tian is the youngest disciple of Lingbao Sect’s Lingbao Immortal King. This time, it was the Lingbao Immortal King who sent him out for training!” Each version of his identity became a topic of conversation among the five cities.

In a teahouse of Longyin City, Xue Sha wore crimson robes and gazed with cold eyes. His presence caused the teahouse’s patrons to exchange wary glances.

Xue Sha had traversed all five cities. No need for investigation—everywhere people spoke of Luo Tian. He naturally learned that the one who killed Zhu Fenghuo was Luo Tian, and people’s discussions left him shaken.

Immortal King disciples. Immortal King’s son. These pieces of information made Xue Sha hesitate to act. If the rumors were true, even if he killed Luo Tian, it would bring destruction upon himself and Zhu Fenghuo. Though Zhu Fenghuo held some status in Tianmen Sect, defying an all-powerful Immortal King would bring ruin upon the entire sect.

“Did you hear? Li Tianxiao has summoned a group of friends to attack Tianyuan Sect and destroy it!”

“Why haven’t I heard? I heard Rantian Sect and Zhenxian Sect have sent their prodigies!” As Xue Sha pondered, murmurs filled his ears.

“That’s certain. Li Xiulong’s son, Li Haoran, joined Zhenxian Sect. And Rantian Sect’s Yao Qishui has a good relationship with Li Tianxiao, even having been saved by him before.”

“Li Haoran and Yao Qishui—both are just a step away from the Heavenly Sage realm. They should be enough to trouble Luo Tian! Add Li Tianxiao and his summoned Daoist realm masters, and Luo Tian will have to reveal all his secrets. Otherwise, no one can stop him!” Xue Sha overheard the murmurs and narrowed his eyes. He slowly rose.

“Let these fools test him first!” Xue Sha walked toward the teahouse’s exit. However, a tall figure stood before him, blocking his path.

The youth wore earthy yellow robes. Though it seemed outdated, on his tall frame, it didn’t appear so.

“Who are you?” Xue Sha’s expression changed. His aura subtly rose. Few people in this small Longyin City could recognize him.

“I am not important. What matters is I have an opportunity for you. Are you interested?” The youth smiled.

“Not interested!” Xue Sha’s face darkened. Being recognized here was not his intention.

“Haha, I never thought the legendary Xue Sha of Zhu Fenghuo’s blood guard would be such a coward! But don’t worry, this opportunity will benefit you!” The youth smiled, gazing at Xue Sha.

“Speak! If it’s a lie, I’ll make you regret it!” Xue Sha’s face was cold. His nature was proud; no one in Tianmen Sect looked down on him except a few. If not for the rumors of five cities, Xue Sha would have already attacked Tianyuan Sect and destroyed it.

This so-called clumsy youth dared to belittle him, wounding his pride.

“Let me first make a deal. I’m certain that if you obtain it, your advancement to the Heavenly Sage realm will be imminent!” The youth smiled.

“How?” Xue Sha’s face remained cold, but his mind paused. He gazed at the youth.

The Heavenly Sage realm was a small step above the Daoist realm. Yet in Tianmen Sect, it was a world of difference—equivalent to a sect elder. Zhu Fenghuo himself was at the Heavenly Sage realm, one of the eight inner disciples, with status equal to an outer sect elder.

“The opportunity I speak of is within the newly established Tianyuan Sect…” The youth smiled, addressing Xue Sha. Xue Sha’s eyes flickered.

……

In Tianyuan Sect, several leaders wore proud expressions as they addressed Zhao Dahu. Luo Tian was in seclusion; Long Youran had returned with Long Li to Longyin City. Luo Tian entrusted the matters to Zhao Dahu, confident he could handle it.

“Third Captain, we’ve spread word of our leader’s background. Now everyone knows our great leader has a powerful figure supporting him!” The subordinates addressed Zhao Dahu.

“Indeed, the rest is beyond our control,” Zhao Dahu smiled. He could guess Luo Tian’s intention: to make people fear his backing force, preventing them from acting against him and giving him time to break through the Heavenly Sage realm.

“Drip… drip…” Sweat dripped onto the ground. Luo Tian sat cross-legged in his room, eyes closed. His aura continuously rose.

If someone could see the state within Luo Tian’s body, they would be stunned. At this moment, his body seemed like a world of its own, with immortal energy flowing through every part. It continuously nourished and refined his entire body, giving him an ethereal aura.

“Luo Tian, three days later, fight me on Xiulong Mountain. Dare you?” As Luo Tian sequestered himself in meditation, a loud shout echoed at the mountain stronghold’s gate. The Tianyuan Sect members immediately panicked.

“Daoist realm!” Zhao Dahu grimaced, leading the sect’s people out. His gaze fell on a tall man standing outside.

The man was shirtless, his muscles bulging as if about to explode. His voice was thunderous, with a thick beard and an aura of power.

“Xionghu Sect, Ji Dongyang!” Upon seeing the man, Zhao Dahu and others’ faces changed.

Xionghu Sect was like the previous Fenghuo Sect, a band of robbers. However, their strength was slightly inferior to Fenghuo Sect. Ji Dongyang was the leader of Xionghu Sect.

“Dare or not?” Ji Dongyang didn’t even glance at Zhao Dahu but shouted toward the mountain peak.

“We’re currently in seclusion. Please keep it down!” Zhao Dahu addressed Ji Dongyang, though he now led Tianyuan Sect, he was still inferior to Ji Dongyang.

“Get lost… I’m talking to your boss. What are you? You don’t even deserve to speak with me!” Ji Dongyang shouted, raising his massive palm and swinging it toward Zhao Dahu. After all, Zhao Dahu was nothing to him.

Zhao Dahu’s heart trembled. He saw the massive hand approaching his face, his expression darkened. He wanted to resist but was crushed by the Daoist realm’s pressure.

“Buzz…” As the hand was about to strike Zhao Dahu’s face, a humming sound echoed. A streak of light shot from the mountain peak and flew toward Ji Dongyang.

The light’s speed was astonishing. Even Ji Dongyang, a Daoist realm master, couldn’t react in time. When he realized it, his shoulder felt cold.

“Plop…” Blood erupted from Ji Dongyang’s shoulder. The hand that had aimed at Zhao Dahu fell off.

“My people, you dare touch them? Leave! Three days later on Xiulong Mountain, I’ll come. I’ll take your arm as punishment!” A cold voice echoed from the mountain peak, causing Ji Dongyang to tremble. His eyes showed fear.

“Good!” However, Ji Dongyang was a hardened man. He gritted his teeth and picked up the arm from the ground, glaring at the mountain peak before leaving in a huff.

Chapter 1772: Summit of Xiulong Mountain

“Huff…” Watching Ji Dongyang leave in disgrace, Zhao Dahu and others sighed deeply. They gazed at the mountain peak with reverence.

“Buzz…” A powerful suction rose from the summit, creating gusts of wind across the entire mountain.

“What’s happening?” Zhao Dahu and others felt a suffocating aura from the summit.

Suddenly, light flared. Immortal energy seemed to be drawn from the air and converged on the summit.

“Such a lot!” Zhao Dahu exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement. He knew why Luo Tian was secluded.

Luo Tian sat on the mountain peak, his body marked with fine cracks. Immortal energy continuously converged from all directions, flowing into his body through the fissures.

“Almost there!” Luo Tian radiated golden light. He felt his flesh and elixir field strengthening at a terrifying speed.

“Break through the Heavenly Sage realm!” Luo Tian roared, then opened his mouth to inhale. Like swallowing heaven and earth, he absorbed the violent immortal energy.

“Buzz… buzz…” A deep rumbling echoed within Luo Tian’s body. A series of sounds erupted from his pores, and he knew these were the residual Chronos energy within him—belonging to the Nine Realms. Now, they were expelled from his body by immortal energy.

A strange sensation arose in Luo Tian’s heart. It felt like an acknowledgment. At this moment, he knew he was officially recognized by the immortal realm’s rules and had entered the Heavenly Sage realm.

The wind gradually calmed. Zhao Dahu and others gathered outside the courtyard, gazing respectfully at Luo Tian’s room.

“Do you think our leader will succeed? If he does, all problems will vanish!” The bandits whispered among themselves. Though they had spent little time with Luo Tian, he had deeply impressed them.

Luo Tian was approachable. Though his past execution of Zhu Fenghuo and others had left a deep impression, over time, he had won their hearts. Compared to Zhu Fenghuo, Luo Tian was far better. They had even shared wine and he had guided them in cultivation.

“Everyone’s here?” As people waited, Luo Tian’s room slowly opened. A white-robed Luo Tian stepped out, smiling as he surveyed Zhao Dahu and others.

“Congratulations, Elder!” Zhao Dahu and the others felt Luo Tian’s aura of the Heavenly Sage realm immediately. Their voices were filled with excitement as they bowed to him.

“Everyone is family! You will be the backbone of Tianyuan Sect!” Luo Tian spoke softly, then sighed deeply. Though he got along well with them, he knew he wasn’t a good leader.

“I wish Jiang Nanxuan were here. If he was, we might have developed faster!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

“Elder, we’ve embarrassed you!” Zhao Dahu smiled bitterly, recalling Ji Dongyang’s strength. He had no power to resist.

“Don’t blame you. Once I deal with Li Tianxiao, I’ll make some elixirs to boost your strength!” Luo Tian smiled.

He had killed Zhu Fenghuo and his subordinates, damaging Fenghuo Sect’s strength. It was enough to deal with ordinary people but insufficient against Daoist realm masters.

“Thank you, Sect Leader!” Zhao Dahu and others smiled. A Second-Rank Immortal Alchemist boosting their strength was more than enough. Within half a year, Tianyuan Sect would surely surge in power.

“Alright, don’t go out for now. Organize resources. The resources obtained from those city lords should be enough!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Sect Leader, we’ve followed your orders and spread the news. However, Zhu Fenghuo hasn’t appeared yet. Could he be afraid and not come out?”

“Also, Li Tianxiao has gathered many people. I suppose this Ji Dongyang is one of them. Even the messenger was a Daoist realm master. Sect Leader, be careful!” Zhao Dahu knew Luo Tian was eager to stabilize his cultivation and quickly recounted the events of these days, his eyes filled with concern.

Though Luo Tian had now entered the Heavenly Sage realm, Zhao Dahu and others still worried about his safety. They were entirely relying on Luo Tian to maintain their current position. He was their pillar.

“Hmph, alright. Everyone go do your tasks as I said!” Luo Tian nodded and addressed Zhao Dahu and others.

“Yes!” Zhao Dahu, Zhao Erniu, and others smiled excitedly. They bowed to Luo Tian and hurried off to organize resources.

“Stabilize my cultivation, deal with the current issues. Boost Dahu’s strength first, then I’ll leave!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, planning his next steps.

Time flowed slowly. The news of Ji Dongyang’s challenge to Tianyuan Sect spread, shaking the five cities. People rushed to Xiulong Mountain to witness this legendary Luo Tian.

Xiulong Mountain, located in the northwest of Xiulong City. From afar, it looked like a real dragon stretching across heaven and earth. Its peaks were steep, and even a Daoist realm master would struggle to climb to the summit.

Three days passed swiftly. The day of the duel arrived. Before either side had come, the entire Xiulong Mountain—both its summit and base—was filled with people. Their faces showed excitement, waiting for the two main figures to arrive.

“Long time since such a big event in the five cities!” People murmured at the base, their eyes filled with anticipation.

Figures appeared from different directions. People’s faces lit up as they saw several city lords approaching.

“Longyin City Lord Long Li, and his daughter Long Youran! It’s said that Long Li has a good relationship with Luo Tian. Will he help this Luo Tian?” People immediately started discussing.

Long Li remained expressionless, leading Long Youran through the crowd. At the same time, Sun Luocheng, Zhang Fangfeng, and Zhang Lie also emerged from the crowd. Compared to Long Li, their faces were grim. Especially when they saw people’s glances—though no one spoke, the looks on their faces made them pale.

“Long Li, you’ve misjudged. That kid will die soon!” Sun Luocheng, with his bald head, glared at Long Li with mockery.

“Misjudged or not—too early to say!” Long Li smiled faintly at the three.

“Three city lords, let’s bet on it!” Long Youran saw Sun Luocheng and others. Her eyes glowed with a smile, recalling Zhao Dahu’s message. She addressed Sun Luocheng.

“Bet what?” Upon hearing Long Youran, Sun Luocheng’s eyes lit up. He guessed her intention. Zhang Fangfeng and Zhang Lie also gazed at Long Youran.

They had just been extorted by Luo Tian, nearly losing everything. Now that Long Youran proposed a bet, they wanted to recover some.

“Of course, the outcome of this fight!”

“If Luo Tian wins, I lose. If he loses, I win!” Long Youran said with a playful tone.

“No way…” Upon hearing Long Youran’s words, Sun Luocheng shook his head like a drum.

“Little girl, you think we’re fools? This Luo Tian is definitely dead. We wouldn’t bet on him winning!” Zhang Fangfeng shook his head.

“Fine, then reverse it. If Luo Tian wins, I win. I’ll give you each a hundred immortal stones. If I lose, you each give me a hundred!” Long Youran gazed at them again.

“Hiss…” Upon hearing her words, people gasped.

Immortal stones—hard currency in the immortal realm. Like Nine Realms’ Qi Stones, but far more precious. A hundred of them equaled two years of Longyin City’s income. Long Youran’s bet was no small matter.

“If I win, you give me a hundred immortal stones. If I lose, we each give you fifty!” Zhang Lie gazed at Long Youran. Fifty stones weren’t a small sum. They needed money now.

“Alright!” Long Youran nodded, feigning reluctance but secretly delighted.

“Old man also wants to bet. Do you dare?” As Long Youran agreed, a voice echoed in people’s ears—cold.

“Li Tianxiao Senior has arrived!” People heard the voice and turned to see several figures approaching. Their eyes showed respect.

“How do you bet?” As the figures appeared, Long Li and others focused on them. Their eyes narrowed slightly but Long Youran still asked.

“According to their standards, ten times more. If we win, you give us five hundred immortal stones. If we lose, I’ll give you a thousand!” A young man in white robes stood arrogantly, gazing at Long Youran.

“Of course, if you can’t pay, you can offer yourself as collateral!” His eyes roamed over Long Youran, as if wanting to devour her.

Chapter 1773: A Life-Defying Bet

“You…” Upon hearing the young man’s flippant words, Long Youran’s face turned angry. Even Long Li’s expression darkened as he gazed at the youth.

“Don’t you dare bet? You said you had confidence in this Luo Tian!” The young man saw Long Youran’s red face and felt even more excited.

“Unexpectedly, I came down to avenge. But now I’ve encountered such an exquisite beauty. If I enjoy her, and present her to the sect elders, it would be a great achievement!” The young man thought. He was Li Haoran, the sole son of Li Xiulong and an outer disciple of Zhenxian Sect. Though he was an outer disciple, he had reached the Daoist realm.

Five hundred immortal stones were no small sum. Even Long Li would have to sell everything to pay them.

Li Tianxiao stood there, allowing his son’s words. He clearly approved of Li Haoran’s actions. In his view, Long Li and Long Youran were nothing.

“Haha, I’ll also bet a thousand immortal stones. Beauty shouldn’t be monopolized!” Before Long Li could speak, another laugh echoed from behind Li Tianxiao. A young man in gray robes smiled and stepped forward beside Li Haoran.

“Fatty…” People’s first thought was the man’s fatness. His entire body looked like a ball.

“Qishui Senior, you also want her? Then I won’t interfere!” Li Haoran saw the fat man and paused, addressing him.

Rantian Sect was a renowned sect in the lower three realms. Compared to Li Haoran’s Zhenxian Sect, it was stronger. Few sects in the lower three realms dared to provoke Rantian Sect.

Yao Qishui was a grandson of a sect elder. He was spoiled and indulgent. Li Haoran had heard of him before. Yao Qishui once traveled the world, flirted with a sect’s daughter, and was beaten half-dead by an unknown sect. He escaped using his grandfather’s means to Xiulong City, where he was saved by Li Tianxiao.

Yao Qishui was spoiled but grateful. He returned to Rantian Sect and became Xiulong City’s greatest support. Even Li Haoran entering Zhenxian Sect was due to Yao Qishui’s help. Xiulong City’s current status was also thanks to Yao Qishui.

“Little girl, follow me. I’ll make you eat and drink well. I can bring you into Rantian Sect and make you an inner disciple!” Yao Qishui’s eyes glowed with greed, gazing at Long Youran.

“Don’t dream!” Long Youran trembled with anger. She longed to pierce this spoiled fat man with a sword, but even one wouldn’t penetrate his thick skin.

“Rich indeed! A thousand immortal stones—betting so easily. I’ve never seen a thousand before!” People gazed at Yao Qishui, marveling at his boldness.

“Then do you bet or not?” Yao Qishui boasted, looking around with pride. He loved being the center of attention.

“Not betting!” As Long Youran didn’t know what to do, a playful voice echoed. A white-robed Luo Tian appeared in people’s sight.

“Luo Tian!” People gasped, their eyes filled with disbelief. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to actually come.

“Who gave him the courage?” People then looked at Li Tianxiao and others. Besides Li Tianxiao, Li Haoran, and Yao Qishui, there were seven or eight Daoist realm masters. This was a terrifying force capable of destroying the five cities.

“Tremendous influence!” People were awed. Then they saw Luo Tian alone, with no one behind him.

“If he doesn’t have a force behind him, then he’s foolish!” People murmured, recalling the rumors about Luo Tian.

“Boy, why did you kill my nephew?” Li Tianxiao’s old eyes glowed with killing intent as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Ask him yourself! I’ll let you question your nephew!” Luo Tian smiled, then surveyed the three. He nodded slightly—Li Tianxiao, Li Haoran, and Yao Qishui’s auras were strong. Though slightly inferior to his Daoist realm days, they were still top-tier among Daoist realms.

“Your courage is great!” Yao Qishui’s fat face jiggled as he gazed at Luo Tian. Though he wasn’t much in Rantian Sect, he hadn’t heard of Luo Tian before. As for the rumors, Yao Qishui wouldn’t believe an Immortal King’s disciple would come to their lower realms and this desolate place. He thought it was just idle talk.

“Always like that!” Luo Tian gazed at Yao Qishui. This man was definitely the fattest he had ever seen. His name fit him perfectly—his body looked like it was filled with water, ready to burst and drench himself.

“Brave? Then why not bet? I see. You know you’ll die, so you don’t want her to bet!” Yao Qishui suddenly realized.

“Exactly!” Upon hearing Yao Qishui’s words, people nodded in understanding. They gazed at Luo Tian.

“No! You don’t have a chance to pay the bet!” Luo Tian spoke softly. These people were nothing but dirt under his feet, and he had no need to fear anything.

“Since you don’t bet, then go to the duel site!” Li Tianxiao’s eyes glowed coldly. He was eager to start. His body moved, leaping like a monkey up the steep mountain wall.

“Wait! I’ll make you die painfully, suffering all the world’s pain!” Li Haoran glared with killing intent and leaped into the air, becoming a streak of light up Xiulong Mountain.

“Little girl, after I finish this kid, we’ll discuss a beautiful life!” Yao Qishui addressed Long Youran without even looking at Luo Tian. His short legs jumped, bouncing like a ball up the mountain.

“Your end is certain!” Ji Dongyang’s eyes glowed with hatred. He touched his empty sleeve, recalling he had asked Li Tianxiao to take over after his last battle. Even Li Tianxiao couldn’t help with his missing arm.

Including Ji Dongyang, seven Daoist realm masters rose and ascended the mountain peak. Ten people’s auras soared into the sky, gazing at Luo Tian standing at the mountain base like an ant.

“Luo Tian, come up and die!” Li Tianxiao shouted, his voice filled with unhidden killing intent.

“Luo Tian, run!” Long Li spoke seriously, his face filled with concern. He didn’t know Luo Tian’s current state.

“Don’t worry, old Long. Watch our leader destroy these bastards!” Long Youran patted Long Li’s shoulder playfully, speaking boldly.

“Don’t be so bold!” Zhang Fangfeng and others sneered, their faces filled with disdain as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” As people sneered, a wave of energy rose beneath Luo Tian. Everyone gasped, their mouths open in shock.

Immortal energy surrounded Luo Tian’s feet like a cloud of immortals, lifting him gently into the air.

“This…!” Long Li’s face was filled with shock. He couldn’t believe his eyes, gazing at Luo Tian ascending into the sky.

“Heaven… heaven… Heavenly Sage!” Zhang Fangfeng stared at Luo Tian soaring upward, exclaiming. At the same time, he felt Luo Tian’s outward aura, making him feel a vast sky above and Luo Tian as the embodiment of Daoist law.

“My heavens! The five cities have produced a Heavenly Sage!” Everyone exclaimed, their eyes filled with reverence.

“Too demonic!” Long Li smiled, his heart also greatly delighted. A Heavenly Sage was a massive impact on him.

The ten people on the mountain peak also trembled, their legs shaking. Their first thought was to flee. They were Daoist realm masters, but against a Heavenly Sage, they had no chance of victory.

“Damn it!” However, they soon realized their situation. The mountain peak was only a few hundred feet in diameter.

“Climbing up is easy, but descending is hard!” They now understood the meaning of this saying. When climbing, they were agile, but descending would require effort. If they jumped down directly, even if they didn’t die, they’d be injured.

Thinking of this, they looked at Yao Qishui. This place was chosen by him to confront them and kill Luo Tian in front of everyone. But they hadn’t expected this iron wall.

“Damn it! How could he be a Heavenly Sage? Why didn’t you tell me earlier!” Yao Qishui shouted, his feet jumping in frustration. He deeply understood the power of a Heavenly Sage.
