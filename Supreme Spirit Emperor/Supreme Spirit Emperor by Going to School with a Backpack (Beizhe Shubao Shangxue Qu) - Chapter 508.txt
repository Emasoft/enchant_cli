“Damn it, is there no end to this? I swear!” Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo rose from the sand, spitting out grains of sand as they cursed loudly.

“What in hell are you two? Do you even know how to behave?” The two oddities felt as if they had forgotten to carry their fortune-telling calendar, having been insulted repeatedly.

“Boom…!” As the two finished their curses, a cold and killing aura swept over them again, eight figures thundering toward them.

“Damn…” The two cursed again, but this time they had learned their lesson, immediately stepping aside.

“Boom…!” However, the two miscalculated the number of opponents; previously it had been one person each, but this time it was eight. The result was predictable—both were sent flying again, filling their mouths with sand.

“Cough… cough…” Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo rose again, their eyes burning with intense anger, red from fury.

In a short moment, they had been knocked away twice, leaving them utterly frustrated.

“Damn it, when have we ever suffered such a loss? This is a blatant insult—only slightly less than the humiliation when Luotian robbed us! This isn’t over!” Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo roared, their feet flashing with power as they chased after the幽冥八卫.

“Move aside!” As the two took another step, a deep voice rang out, a tall figure stomping through the heavens toward Sun Kainian’s direction.

“Damn it, no matter who you are, stop right there!” Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo’s eyes burned red; without hesitation, they waved their hands, conjuring a large gray net that they hurled behind them.

“Huh… tomb robbers!” As the two unleashed their net, the tall figure abruptly halted. The familiar voice made Sun Kainian slightly stunned.

“Zhanbiao! How did you end up here?” Sun Kainian recognized the person, his face filled with disbelief.

Chapter 1956: Sand Scorpion ()

“Hum…” Upon seeing Chen Zhanbiao, Sun Kainian instantly收回 the gray net.

“Run fast…” Chen Zhanbiao ignored Sun Kainian, striding forward and fleeing into the Death Desert.

“Zhanbiao, what’s going on?” Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo caught up with Chen Zhanbiao, shouting questions. But when they heard the roaring battle cries behind them, they stopped asking and exerted all their strength to run with Chen Zhanbiao into the Death Desert.

“Damn it, there he is! He has accomplices—kill them all!” The battle cries echoed through the air, figures overturning the desert, carrying overwhelming momentum as they chased after Chen Zhanbiao and the two.

“Damn it, why am I so unlucky!” Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo felt the people behind them, cursing inwardly. Today was truly their worst day.

“Luotian, you really do curse me! I didn’t even see you yet, and already I’ve suffered a massive misfortune!” Sun Kainian cursed. He knew Chen Zhanbiao was here, so Luotian would definitely not be far away. Luotian wouldn’t let Chen Zhanbiao appear alone in the Death Desert.

“Big brother told me to stay at that Hao family’s place. A kid came to provoke me, and I killed him. They chased me, so I ran!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke loudly, his voice filled with anger.

“…”

Hearing Chen Zhanbiao’s words, Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo were speechless. They hadn’t expected this ancestor to be so casual; they didn’t need to guess—Chen Zhanbiao had definitely killed someone from a major faction.

“Run…” Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo sighed in their hearts, knowing that even if they revealed themselves as disciples of the Thieves’ Sect, those red-eyed people would not believe them.

As Chen Zhanbiao and Sun Kainian entered the Death Desert, it became chaotic. Those seeking opportunities in the desert were all terrified.

At that moment, Luotian didn’t know that his acquaintances had all entered the Death Desert.

Golden sands, only the sound of swirling sand. Luotian and another person walked through the desert without encountering any danger, but it was unusually quiet.

“No wonder so many people go in groups—probably can’t bear this loneliness!” Luotian muttered to himself. If it weren’t for Ran Hao constantly talking to him, he might have gone mad.

Also, the desert had no path; they relied on Ran Hao’s experience to move forward, saving Luotian a lot of time.

Time passed slowly; they walked for seven days and stopped at a stone tablet engraved with four big characters: Death Desert.

“Brother Xue, we’ve just passed the outer region of the Death Desert. The real one begins beyond this tablet!”

“The outer Death Desert still has traces, but once you enter the real one, there are no signs to follow—only memory. I’m not sure if I can find my way, and I don’t know what awaits us deeper inside.” Ran Hao spoke to Luotian, gazing at the endless desert ahead.

“Outer region…” Upon hearing Ran Hao’s words, Luotian was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected to have walked so long just for the outer region; how long would it take to reach the center of the Death Desert?

“Hmph, Ran Hao, you can choose to leave. I can go alone! Here’s a million spirit stones—take it!” Luotian offered Ran Hao a storage bag, not forcing him to continue. He handed over the bag, knowing that Ran Hao’s experience had saved him a lot of time and effort. The supplies he had prepared might even save his life if he continued alone.

Although Longque said he would intervene if there was danger, it was better not to trouble him unnecessarily.

“Brother Xue, I’m going with you!” Ran Hao didn’t take the storage bag, his face showing determination. He wanted to become stronger; he couldn’t wait any longer. With only a month left, the deep Death Desert was his only chance for a short-term power boost.

“Good, Brother Hao. If there’s any opportunity, you can fight for it, but don’t compete with me over one thing: the corpse of a dragon!” Luotian spoke softly, his tone formal. Even brothers could turn against each other over interests; how much more so for Luotian and Ran Hao?

Though Ran Hao seemed decent, reminding Luotian of his past self, he wouldn’t give up an opportunity for him.

“Zhi zhi…” As they spoke, the two stepped into the core region of the Death Desert. A series of piercing sounds echoed in Luotian and Ran Hao’s ears, causing them to stop instantly.

“I’ll check it out!” Ran Hao took a step toward the sound, crouching carefully to listen.

In an instant, Ran Hao’s face changed dramatically; his body retreated sharply, gazing at the place he had just looked.

“Boom…” As Ran Hao left, the sand where he had stood exploded instantly, sending up a cloud of swirling dust. A white skull head rose into Luotian and Ran Hao’s view.

“What happened?” Luotian furrowed his brow, stepping toward the skull head, his eyes filled with confusion.

“Be careful! It’s a sand scorpion!” Ran Hao shouted, his voice making Luotian frown. He sensed no life energy within the skull head.

“Hum…” A wave of energy spread out, a black light shooting directly from the skull head’s eyes toward Luotian’s throat.

Seeing the dark light, Luotian let out a cold hum. Seven-colored flames erupted instantly, enveloping his entire body. Luotian’s hand became a blur, grabbing the dark light.

A piercing sound echoed; a black scorpion, about palm-sized, was clutched in Luotian’s hand. Its venomous tail glinted and stabbed toward Luotian’s forearm, but it failed to pierce his flesh.

“Only a Nascent Soul!” Luotian shook his head lightly. If it were a Nascent Soul of the later stage, he might have been pierced.

Ran Hao had previously told Luotian about the venomous insects in the desert; this sand scorpion was one of the most common and numerous, yet deadly to those of the same level. A single sting would result in severe poisoning—mild cases caused withered meridians, while serious ones could kill.

“Truly terrifying! If it were a later Nascent Soul, I would already be poisoned!” Luotian, despite having caught the scorpion, still broke out in cold sweat.

“Unpredictable!” Luotian shook his head lightly, his eyes cautious. Only now did he feel the true danger of the Death Desert.

“Burn it!” Luotian waved his hand, seven-colored flames enveloping the scorpion and beginning to burn it.

A wailing cry echoed from the scorpion, and within a dozen breaths, a blue smoke rose from Luotian’s hand. All that remained was a black shell in his grasp.

“Even the shell could withstand the Seven-Colored Flames!” Luotian’s eyes widened in surprise. He tapped the black shell with his hand, speaking softly.

At the same time, a drop of crystalline liquid fell from the black shell. Luotian quickly grabbed it with a jade bottle, storing it away.

“This is the scorpion’s venom! You’ve even managed to refine it!” Ran Hao exclaimed, surprised. Though he knew Luotian’s Seven-Colored Flames were terrifying.

“This venom could be a great weapon if there was more of it!” Luotian’s eyes gleamed, but he soon shook his head.

“Let’s go…” Luotian continued, and the two took another step deeper into the Death Desert.

They walked for three more days. Luotian encountered more bones and killed over thirty sand scorpions, refining nearly a hundred drops of scorpion venom.

“Kid, I’ve sensed the aura of the Fire Cloud Sword!” That day, after Luotian killed a sand scorpion comparable to a Nascent Soul of the middle stage, Longque’s voice echoed in his mind, causing Luotian to pause slightly.

“Really?” Luotian’s eyes twitched. A day ago, he and Ran Hao had gotten lost; neither spoke of it, both fearing the other would worry.

“Hmph, head ten million miles toward the sun, and you’ll find it. There’s a palace entrance blown out by the sandstorm. Enter the palace, and I can more accurately sense the Fire Cloud Sword’s location. That palace also holds a great opportunity; if I’m not mistaken, it’s the tomb of an Immortal King, blown to the surface by the sandstorm!” Longque’s voice rang out, shaking Luotian’s spirit.

“Let’s go… I have a direction!” Luotian spoke softly, gazing at the blazing sun above. He licked his dry lips and led Ran Hao toward the sun’s direction.

“Brother Xue, are you sure? If it goes wrong, I might really get lost!” Ran Hao’s eyes showed concern, fearing Luotian had no plan.

“Don’t worry—eighty percent chance!” Luotian laughed, flying toward the direction Longque indicated.

A day later, Luotian and Ran Hao stood at the location Longque had pointed out. Their eyes held confusion, both panting heavily from their flight.

Luotian took out a pill and handed it to Ran Hao, taking one himself as they recovered and surveyed the terrain. However, it looked no different from a normal desert.

“Something’s wrong!” Luotian communicated with Longque, but no matter how he searched, he couldn’t find the so-called entrance.

As Luotian was confused, the sky suddenly darkened; the golden sun vanished instantly, and the sky turned black. Stars appeared in Luotian and Ran Hao’s view.

Chapter 1957: Earth Store King ()

“Night has come again!” Luotian and Ran Hao spoke softly, gazing at the black night sky. The desert’s night arrived unusually quickly, almost instantly.

Night and day were two different worlds—day was hot, while night was icy. Without preparation, no one could endure this sudden change.

Cold air swept over them; the desert’s starry sky was unusually beautiful, an endless expanse of sand and a boundless night.

“Hiss…” As Luotian and Ran Hao adapted to the cold, a growling sound echoed in their ears.

“Zhi zhi…” A piercing and familiar sound rang out, one they had heard countless times on their journey—sand scorpion sounds.

However, soon after, both men’s faces turned pale; the piercing sound echoed around them again.

A black sand scorpion emerged from the ground, its black eyes glowing under the starlight, spotting Luotian and Ran Hao standing nearby.

At the same time, more sounds of earth breaking echoed out; black sand scorpions emerged from the ground one after another, densely packed and layer upon layer. Luotian and Ran Hao’s hair stood on end immediately.

“Rustle…” Soon, the scorpions discovered Luotian and Ran Hao’s presence, swiftly surrounding them.

“Roar…” Seven-colored fire dragons flew from Luotian’s hands, instantly protecting them. They didn’t take to the air; they knew sand scorpions of the higher Nascent Soul stages could fly, and flying was useless.

“Damn it, Master, you’re pointing us in the wrong direction! This is a dead end!” Luotian’s hands formed seals, and seven-colored fire dragons flew from his hands.

“Eight Directions Fire Array!” Luotian grabbed, and a sea of fire swept over the area. Sand scorpion corpses were refined into shells by the seven-colored flames, their venom falling onto the sand.

Although Xiaoqi’s flames were powerful, the scorpions were too numerous; even Luotian felt strained. After an hour, the fire sea contracted from a hundred feet to fifty.

A series of white smoke rose; the venom refined from the scorpions corroded the sand, gradually lowering the ground beneath Luotian and Ran Hao.

Time passed slowly; the scorpions, seemingly fearless, rushed toward Luotian and Ran Hao. However, they were all killed by the seven-colored flames.

“Hum…” The ground was continuously corroded by the venom; Luotian didn’t know how long he had sunk, until it seemed to collapse. The sand around them began to twist violently, forming a whirlpool that pulled Luotian and Ran Hao downward.

As if guided by an invisible force, the whirlpool expanded outward, and a series of growling sounds echoed from within.

“Damn it, what is this!” Luotian and Ran Hao’s faces were grim; they watched the scorpions being sucked into the whirlpool, disappearing into unknown depths. Their eyes showed fear, but the powerful suction made it impossible to escape—especially for Ran Hao, who would have been swallowed by the rapidly expanding whirlpool had Luotian not pulled him.

“This isn’t working!” Luotian looked at the deepening and expanding whirlpool, now spanning nearly a thousand feet. The scorpions had already vanished completely into the whirlpool.

“I can’t hold on anymore!” Ran Hao shouted, watching the whirlpool and shouting loudly. Especially seeing the twisted space above it, he was certain that if he were sucked in, he would be torn apart.

“I can’t either…” Luotian roared, but he had no power to resist; both men finally couldn’t hold on and were sucked into the whirlpool.

“Hum…” A trembling sound echoed; the golden sand whirlpool grew larger, and the suction became stronger.

The world changed color; the whirlpool intensified rapidly, sweeping half of the Death Desert within a day. A massive wave of sand followed one after another; no one could escape the irresistible whirlpool—anything that touched it was sucked into the endless vortex.

“This suction…” Gu Qianxue’s face turned pale as she gazed at the golden whirlpool, allowing it to absorb her without resistance.

“Damn it…” The black cloud that had been chasing Gu Qianxue instantly transformed into a middle-aged man, his entire body cloaked in black. He gazed at Gu Qianxue being absorbed by the golden whirlpool.

“What is this!” The middle-aged man stared at the vast whirlpool that shook the sky and earth, his eyes filled with intense shock. He unleashed True Immortal power to resist the suction but failed utterly; in front of the golden whirlpool, he felt like an ant.

“Damn it… I knew meeting Luotian would bring misfortune! What the hell is this!” Sun Kainian, Chen Zhanbiao, and Sima Tuo also encountered the golden whirlpool; before they could react, they were sucked in.

“Ah…” The large group chasing Chen Zhanbiao also screamed, being sucked into the whirlpool.

Suffocation…

Luotian’s body was caught in endless sand, feeling extremely difficult to breathe. The immense pressure made even his flesh strained.

Luotian didn’t know where he was, only feeling his body moving with the sand continuously. He remained conscious but dazed.

He released his spiritual sense, but found only sand around him, like a flowing river of sand. He also sensed others; one young man of the Nascent Soul stage couldn’t withstand the pressure and was crushed into fragments, vanishing in the flowing sand.

Time passed slowly; Luotian didn’t know how long it had been, but the suffocation felt stronger. Worse still, there was no spiritual energy to replenish in this sand whirlpool; the consumption of spiritual energy was unusually terrifying.

Luotian judged time by his spiritual energy’s depletion, and after three days, he finally felt the pressure disappear. He sensed an open space around him.

His body continued to fall, and after a while, he landed on the ground with a thunderous sound. Though the ground was soft, he was still thrown into disarray, feeling his bones almost broken.

Luotian caught his breath and looked around; before he could see clearly, his neck hurt—his head was pierced by a black sand scorpion’s tail.

“Hiss…” Luotian inhaled sharply, grabbing the scorpion from his neck and extinguishing it with flames.

Though the scorpion was dead, its venom spread instantly throughout Luotian’s body.

Luotian’s meridians immediately withered, causing cold sweat to roll down his face. Seven-colored flames swept through his meridians, driving out the scorpion’s venom.

As he expelled the venom, Luotian’s face changed; the venom was nowhere to be found, no matter how he searched.

Until the flames swept through his entire body, Luotian finally found the venom’s location and forced it to his toes, slowly refining it with seven-colored flames.

“Truly terrifying!” Luotian muttered softly; just a moment ago, his meridians had shrunk significantly. If he had delayed even slightly or if the venom were a little stronger, he would have suffered heavy losses, possibly even losing his cultivation.

While refining the venom, Luotian also looked around, his eyes filled with shock.

A palace made of sand appeared in Luotian’s view, and a stone tablet stood before him.

“Earth Store King Palace!” Luotian spoke softly, gazing at the big characters on the tablet, his eyes filled with disbelief.

On the other side, others also encountered the same scene; some were poisoned and died immediately, while others showed shock, gazing at the tablet.

“Earth Store King! Is this the one from Hell?” Luotian muttered to himself, knowing that there was a powerful figure named Earth Store King in Hell.

“How could the Earth Store King’s palace be here in the Death Desert?” Luotian quickly thought of Longque’s mention of an Immortal King’s tomb, but he hadn’t expected it to be the burial place of a Hell figure.

“This isn’t his true tomb; I don’t sense any Immortal King’s aura here. It must be a selection trial!” Longque’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind.

“If this Earth Store King is powerful in Hell, even a fake tomb would be dangerous. Kid, fight hard; if you can obtain the inheritance here, it will benefit your future. Also, I sense that the Fire Cloud Sword is here, but something is suppressing it—find it!” Longque spoke to Luotian.

“I wonder how Ran Hao is doing…” Luotian muttered, then prepared himself before stepping toward the entrance with a determined look.

As Luotian stepped in, the sand beneath his feet sent out waves of energy; five whirlwinds rose, stirring up the sand on the ground. Finally, they condensed into five sand figures before Luotian’s eyes, each radiating the aura of a Nascent Soul at its peak.

“Hum…” The humming echoed, and five sand figures rushed toward Luotian without hesitation.

“Is this a test?” Luotian muttered, the five sand figures were strong—each at Nascent Soul peak—but Luotian didn’t take them seriously.

“One punch… two punches…” A series of fists appeared before Luotian, surrounding him. The five sand figures also continuously punched, the sound of collisions echoing.

“Boom…” After an hour of battle, one sand figure couldn’t withstand Luotian’s attack and was crushed by a punch to the chest, its body cracking and collapsing into sand.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Luotian, like a god, quickly reduced the remaining four sand figures into piles of sand.

“Not too bad…” Luotian shook his head lightly, not expecting the Earth Store King’s test to be so simple.

“Hum…” However, as Luotian caught his breath and prepared to head toward the stairs ahead, waves of energy rose again. The five sand figures he had crushed reassembled and rushed toward him once more.

“Hmph?” Luotian furrowed his brow, sensing something was off, but the sand figures gave him no time to think. Five golden fists rushed toward Luotian with a thunderous impact.

Luotian had no choice but to fight again; after an hour, the five sand figures turned into five piles of sand. However, this time it was even faster—within an instant, they reformed into five sand figures and rushed toward Luotian.

“Can’t be killed!” Luotian quickly realized the severity of the situation; although the sand figures would disintegrate, they would reform. This meant he would be endlessly drained without end.

After an hour, Luotian panted heavily; looking at the five sand figures, he had eliminated them repeatedly but was greatly exhausted.

“Can’t do this forever!” Luotian roared, this time not rushing to kill the sand figures but thinking of a way to break through the situation.

However, after thinking for a while, Luotian couldn’t find any solution; he was forced to let the five sand figures drain his strength and spiritual energy.

As time passed, Luotian felt a more terrifying truth: there was no spiritual energy in this Earth Store King Palace. Once his spiritual energy was depleted, it would be gone for good.

“What the hell do I do?” Luotian cursed inwardly, unable to find a solution. He had just entered the Earth Store King Palace but already faced such an insurmountable problem, which made him feel embarrassed.

Fire, water—Luotian tried everything but failed completely.

“This sand is lifeless; unless one has world-shattering strength to annihilate these sands!” Luotian sighed bitterly. If he had such power, why would he come to the Death Desert?

“Lifeless!” However, Luotian muttered softly, a spark of inspiration in his mind.

“This Death Desert is a lifeless place; I can’t change the entire desert, but I can definitely do it for this palace!” Luotian thought of how he had once broken through Nie Sheng’s death energy, and it seemed feasible.

As he thought, Luotian waved his hand, and a series of seeds flew from his hands into the palace.

“Everything Revives, Grasses Become Soldiers!” Luotian shattered the five sand figures again, his hands forming seals. His spiritual energy erupted, enveloping the entire palace.

A powerful vitality rapidly spread through the palace, and as the collisions echoed, a series of herbs grew up, turning the entire palace green.

“It worked!” As vitality spread, the five sand figures no longer reformed and scattered into every corner of the palace.

Luotian sighed in relief, but his spiritual energy was greatly depleted after long-term consumption.

He took out a pill and put it in his mouth, sighing inwardly. Fortunately, he had prepared enough pills when entering the Middle Three Heavens; if not, he might have encountered danger in this Earth Store King Palace.

Luotian sat cross-legged on the ground, beginning to recover, determined to maintain a full-strength state.

Meanwhile, others entering through other entrances also faced the same problem as Luotian. Compared to him, they were less fortunate; some were killed by sand figures immediately, while others had their spiritual energy completely drained.

“Cough… cough…” A black-cloaked Gu Qianxue coughed up two mouthfuls of blood, her body battered and thrown back by a sand figure. She fell to the ground, pale-faced, gazing at the sand figure rushing toward her with a faint look of resignation.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed, but Gu Qianxue slowly opened her eyes, gazing at the sand figure with confusion. The sand figure had just disintegrated.

“Is it because I’ve drained all my spiritual energy?” Gu Qianxue muttered, exhaling in relief. Her condition was already poor; fighting five at once had been sheer luck.

“Without pills, I’ll have to rely on my body now. I wonder how Luotian is doing… if I can kill him here!” Gu Qianxue muttered, stepping toward the corridor.

Luotian also slowly stood up, walking into the corridor with a smile. He knew he had an advantage in this Earth Store King Palace—more pills than others.

Golden corridor, Luotian carefully walked through it. The two sides were dark; after half an hour of walking, he finally reached the end of the corridor. A light appeared in his view, and wind sounds echoed in his ears.

Luotian took a step forward, exiting the corridor to find himself in a vast palace again. As he entered, a powerful pressure descended upon his body.

Still sand-crafted palace, but in the center stood a green ancient coffin. The wind sounds and powerful pressure came from this green coffin.

The ancient coffin was ten zhang long, four zhang wide; it had no patterns on its surface, smooth like a bronze mirror.

A series of sand patterns covered the green coffin, waves spreading across it within a hundred zhang.

Around the palace were entrances like those behind Luotian. As he observed the surroundings, a black-cloaked Gu Qianxue also emerged from another entrance.

At the moment Gu Qianxue appeared, Luotian noticed her presence; his body trembled slightly, his eyes filled with disbelief. Then it turned to joy—Luotian hadn’t expected to meet Gu Qianxue here.

“Qianxue!” Luotian exclaimed, instinctively taking a step toward her direction. However, as he took the step, a powerful resistance appeared on his body.

“This…” Luotian furrowed his brow but this resistance wasn’t a problem for him. It just consumed spiritual energy.

But Luotian didn’t care; he could sense Gu Qianxue’s current state was poor, and she had wounds all over her body.

With the powerful wind force, Luotian finally reached Gu Qianxue’s side but was met with her cold eyes.

“Who are you?” Gu Qianxue gazed at Luotian, who was still wearing the illusion mask and looked like an old man. She couldn’t recognize him.

“I’m Luotian!” Luotian took out a pill and handed it to Gu Qianxue, his eyes soft.

“Luotian?” Hearing Luotian’s words, Gu Qianxue’s eyebrows furrowed slightly but she took the pill from Luotian. Her condition was indeed poor and needed recovery.

“I’ll return this favor!” Gu Qianxue spoke softly, her voice still cold and distant.

“Ghost Queen, you’re flirting with men again!” As Gu Qianxue’s words just finished, a black figure emerged from another entrance. His voice was neither cold nor warm, making Luotian feel uncomfortable.

“Die!” Before Gu Qianxue could speak, the black figure threw a black arrow toward Luotian and Gu Qianxue.

“True Immortal stage!” Luotian’s eyes narrowed slightly, grabbing the black arrow with his hand. If it were normal, he wouldn’t have been sure, but now he could sense the black figure’s condition was poor.

“Who are you?” Luotian coldly asked, grabbing the black arrow in his hand. He had already guessed that Gu Qianxue’s injuries were caused by this person.

“Rasha!” The black figure saw Luotian had caught his attack, his body paused slightly but still coldly spoke. In his view, Luotian was still a Nascent Soul; he himself was a true immortal.

Chapter 1959: Battle with Rasha ()

“Rasha?” Luotian furrowed his brow, sensing Rasha’s aura. His eyes showed a slight tension but seeing Gu Qianxue’s injuries, his killing intent surged.

“Did he injure you?” Luotian asked Gu Qianxue, taking out a piece of clothing and draping it over her.

“Yes!” Gu Qianxue nodded, a hint of shame flashing across her eyes. She hadn’t paid much attention to her clothes during the chase, but now she noticed they were torn and exposed.

“I’ll kill him for you!” Hearing Gu Qianxue’s confirmation, Luotian replied. Then he pushed off the ground, his body suddenly exploding with power as he rushed toward the black-cloaked Rasha.

“Die!” Rasha saw Luotian rushing toward him, his eyes showing contempt.

“Hum…” A golden fist appeared before Rasha; Luotian, with the powerful wind sound, punched toward Rasha.

“Only a Nascent Soul!” Luotian could sense that Rasha’s attack wasn’t too strong and his breath was insufficient.

“Hmph?” Rasha felt surprised, gazing at Luotian. He hadn’t expected Luotian to only suffer a slight shock without serious injury.

“Strong body?”
