The next instant, a sword of condensed lightning appeared before Luo Tian’s eyes, rushing straight for his chest.

“Indeed, the Thunder Domain excels in speed!” Luo Tian had no time to think further; he could only raise his Rending Sky Spear before him.

The lightning sword clashed with the spear, sparks flying everywhere. But soon after, Luo Tian’s expression changed abruptly.

Before he could react, golden lightning surged onto his shoulder, piercing into it.

“Speed is too fast—both in movement and attack, you are far ahead of me!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. This was the first time he had encountered someone of such speed.

“An impressive body!” Li Xingteng withdrew after a single strike, his face revealing a hint of surprise. He hadn’t expected his blade to only pierce through a layer of Luo Tian’s skin.

“Haha! It’s the Heavenly Mechanism Thunder Step, a technique said to be the fastest in the Nine Domains. Luo Tian, now you’re done for! No matter how strong your strength is, you can’t harm Li Xingteng!” Feng Jiutian’s face lit up with joy. He hadn’t expected the turning point to arrive so quickly.

Diaodezhu and his companions furrowed their brows, concern in their eyes. Even Diaodezhu’s face bore a look of disbelief. As someone who excelled in speed, he had certainly heard of the Heavenly Mechanism Thunder Step’s fame. Yet, he was不服 (unconvinced). His clan, the Shadow Fang Ghost Sable, also excelled in speed and possessed a movement technique of their own. However, they had never revealed it to others; such techniques were rarely used because their speed was already at the peak.

“Luo Tian! I’ll teach you my Shadow Fang Ghost Sable’s movement technique. If this continues, you might suffer a disadvantage!” Diaodezhu’s voice carried a solemn tone in Luo Tian’s mind.

Chapter 940: Who is Faster?

“Shadow Fang Step?” Luo Tian’s mind stirred. He knew Li Xingteng’s speed was too fast; the only way to keep up was by unleashing his demonic cultivation. However, Luo Tian didn’t wish to reveal too many of his secrets. If there was a solution, he would naturally not refuse.

Before Luo Tian could respond, a string of incantations accompanied Diaodezhu’s voice, flooding into Luo Tian’s mind. The words sent a tremor through him.

“Head upright, hands level, body straight, legs guarding the crotch, stance balanced in a diagonal...” Diaodezhu’s voice rang solemnly within Luo Tian’s mind. Luo Tian, not daring to be careless, began memorizing it immediately.

But due to Diaodezhu’s transmission of the incantations, Luo Tian became distracted. His wounds multiplied rapidly, blood with a golden sheen staining his body red.

“Haha! Diaodezhu, your friend is done for!” Feng Jiutian’s face bore a triumphant grin. He had regained his confidence, mocking Luo Tian.

Diaodezhu sighed deeply, completing the transmission of all incantations to Luo Tian. His brows furrowed slightly.

Of course, Diaodezhu knew the Shadow Fang Step. He understood how difficult it was to master; under the guidance of Diaoyuanshan, he had spent an entire year before finally mastering it.

He transmitted it to Luo Tian now only as a last-minute measure, hoping to grant him a basic understanding and boost his speed.

Hearing Feng Jiutian’s mockery, Diaodezhu’s face remained cold. His gaze held anticipation as he looked at Luo Tian. He had previously heard Luo Tian say that even those in the Early Sage Stage were no match for him.

“Feng Jiutian, it’s too early to speak of such things!” Diaodezhu replied solemnly. He then turned his gaze back to the platform.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s form was pitiful, as if he were a bloodied beggar. His clothes were torn, his body battered.

“Such a powerful physique! Youngster, I wonder how long you can endure? Today, I’ll wear you down with my speed advantage!” Li Xingteng’s eyes gleamed with excitement. His overwhelming killing intent radiated from him, and his speed seemed to increase further.

Though Luo Tian’s form was battered, it wasn’t fatal—only a little blood had flowed. For someone accustomed to injuries like Luo Tian, it made no difference at all.

“Still, to master the Shadow Fang Step, I must be wounded more severely!” Luo Tian’s face bore a bitter smile. He closed his eyes, and a calm aura radiated from him. At the same time, he entered the state of unity with heaven and earth, as if entering another world. He began to comprehend the Shadow Fang Step.

“Unity with Heaven and Earth!” People’s eyes flashed with surprise. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to possess such a state, as if it were second nature.

Diaodezhu’s eyes glowed with intensity. He muttered lowly, “With such insight, he might truly succeed!”

“Unity with Heaven and Earth? What use is that against my ultimate speed?” Li Xingteng’s face bore contempt. He clearly didn’t regard Luo Tian, now in the state of unity with heaven and earth, as a threat.

Indeed, Li Xingteng’s sword struck only once every time, and Luo Tian blocked it. Three more strikes pierced Luo Tian’s body. If the battle continued too long, even with his powerful physique, Luo Tian would eventually be wounded and exit the state of unity with heaven and earth.

“One... ten...” Time passed slowly. Luo Tian’s wounds multiplied, his entire body appearing as if turned inside out. Some areas revealed bone.

“Haha! I wonder how long you can endure!” Li Xingteng laughed, his heart secretly amazed by Luo Tian’s formidable physique. He had spent so long without managing to kill Luo Tian.

“Diaodezhu, let your friend surrender! If this continues, the boy’s life will be lost!” Feng Jiutian’s face bore triumph as he addressed Diaodezhu.

Diaodezhu, however, wore a mocking expression. He glanced at Feng Jiutian before turning his gaze to Luo Tian in the state of unity with heaven and earth. His eyes flashed with intensity.

Others hadn’t noticed, but Diaodezhu felt Luo Tian’s change. The number of strikes he received had decreased. Previously, Li Xingteng could strike three times per attack; now it had gradually reduced to two. Especially when he saw Luo Tian’s strange postures, Diaodezhu knew he had begun to grasp the Shadow Fang Step.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian’s face grew paler, like a sheet of white paper. His entire body had no good place left; large patches of flesh tore away, blood gushing out. The lightning’s impact pierced his meridians relentlessly.

After three hours, Li Xingteng was utterly stunned. His breath came in heavy gasps, his eyes wide with disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian. In those three hours, Li Xingteng had no idea how many times he had struck Luo Tian. Yet, Luo Tian remained standing like an indestructible force.

Moreover, Li Xingteng noticed something that shook him to his core: the number of times he struck Luo Tian had decreased. This revelation left Li Xingteng trembling.

“Is he even human?” The onlookers’ faces bore intense shock. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s physique to be so formidable, his willpower so unyielding. Even with such grievous wounds, he hadn’t exited the state of unity with heaven and earth.

At last, under people’s astonished gazes, Luo Tian, now a bloodied figure, slowly opened his eyes. His eyes glowed with violet energy, two streaks of purple lightning bursting forth from them.

“Rending Sky Spear!” Luo Tian’s face bore a slight smile. His body was surrounded by green energy, beginning to mend his flesh. His violet eyes gazed at Li Xingteng.

“Finally, he’s exited the state of unity with heaven and earth! That makes things easier!” Li Xingteng, though startled by Luo Tian’s gaze, wore a confident expression.

His lips curled slightly, his eyes filled with mockery. Luo Tian glanced at the grotesque wounds across his body and clenched his Rending Sky Spear tightly. “Now it’s my turn!”

Luo Tian’s entire body seemed to vanish into thin air. Even a half-Sage’s spiritual sense couldn’t track his. A flash of golden light, and three spears shot out in an instant, appearing at Li Xingteng’s chest, abdomen, and head.

Li Xingteng was stunned by Luo Tian’s astonishing speed. However, he quickly moved his feet, activating the Heavenly Mechanism Thunder Step.

“Plop…” In an instant, the spear pierced his body, a cold tearing sensation sending sweat cascading down Li Xingteng’s forehead.

“Too fast!” The people’s faces bore shock as they gazed at Luo Tian, unsure why his speed had suddenly escalated to such terrifying levels.

A hum resonated; Luo Tian’s figure reappeared within people’s sight, standing in an odd posture.

“Is that…?”

“The Shadow Fang Step!” Feng Jiutian, Hu Xiangyang, and Shi Hongtu’s eyes bore boundless shock. They gazed at Luo Tian standing in that strange posture, then turned their eyes to Diaodezhu.

Diaodezhu’s eyes were no less shocked than the three of them. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s comprehension ability to be so terrifying—within a single hour, he had mastered the Shadow Fang Step at the cost of his injuries.

“Diaodezhu, you’ve taught the human race the Shadow Fang Step! Don’t you fear your grandfather Diaoyuanshan will beat you to death?” Feng Jiutian’s face bore endless fury as he barked at Diaodezhu.

“Idiot!” Diaodezhu’s reply was only two words, nearly causing Feng Jiutian to explode with rage.

“Humans! This boy is on equal terms with the Dragon Ancestor. What’s wrong with teaching him?” Diaodezhu muttered inwardly.

“Ah! The Shadow Fang Step of the Ghost Sable Clan! I never thought I’d witness the legendary Shadow Fang Step of the Ghost Sable Clan!” The crowd erupted in murmurs, their eyes gazing at Luo Tian with envy.

“The Shadow Fang Step of the Ghost Sable Clan? What use is that against my Heavenly Mechanism Thunder Step, the pinnacle of speed?” Li Xingteng sneered, his voice brimming with endless confidence. He transformed into lightning, and his sword shot out again.

“Idiot! You don’t understand the saying ‘there are people beyond people, and skies beyond skies!’ Let’s see who is faster today!” Luo Tian sneered, his tone unguarded. He took a step forward, his arm slightly bent, and clashed with Li Xingteng once more.

Yet this time, the result stunned everyone. At first, Luo Tian’s speed was evenly matched with Li Xingteng’s. But as time passed, it gradually began to suppress Li Xingteng.

“Hmph! The Heavenly Mechanism Thunder Step, but against the Shadow Fang Step, it’s just trash!” Diaodezhu once again adopted his pretentious mode. He stood up, his voice filled with endless melancholy as he cast a glance at Feng Jiutian.

Feng Jiutian gritted his teeth, watching Li Xingteng gradually fall under Luo Tian’s control. He knew today he would lose the Phoenix Ancestor’s essence blood. He then gazed at Diaodezhu’s demeanor, wanting to slap him twice but dared not. After all, behind Diaodezhu was Diaoyuanshan—a madman.

The sound of thunder echoed constantly, with large amounts of blood falling from the sky, splattering onto the ground and the barrier.

Finally, under people’s astonished gazes, Luo Tian kicked his foot forward. A bloodied figure collided with the barrier, turning into a mist of blood that clung to it.

“Is he defeated?” People’s faces bore astonishment as they gazed at Luo Tian, now fully recovered and radiating brilliance.

The blood gradually coalesced; Li Xingteng, a Sage Early Stage powerhouse, could still regenerate with his blood. Under people’s astonished gazes, the blood slowly formed a human shape.

“Want to live? That’s too naive!” Luo Tian sneered, his hands clenching. A碧green flame (emerald flame) surged forth, instantly engulfing the blood forming into Li Xingteng.

A heart-wrenching scream echoed in people’s minds, even through the barrier.

“Luo Tian, I’ve lost! Do you really want to finish me off? I am from the Thunder Domain. You four Great Star Domains and the Fire Domain are no match for the Thunder Domain. I’ll die, and the elders of the Thunder Domain won’t forgive you!” Li Xingteng’s spirit figure, his face twisted with hatred, screamed in the green flame. His eyes glared at Luo Tian with resentment.

“Now you’re speaking such foolish words! The people of the Thunder Domain are truly fools!” Luo Tian replied, infusing golden Sage energy into the Emerald Crystal Flame to accelerate its burning.

“You were the one who first harbored murderous intent toward me. Now you dare to hope I’ll spare your life? If it were me, Luo Tian, who was beaten and regenerated with blood, would you show mercy?” Luo Tian spoke coldly. His gaze fell upon Li Maode, his eyes filled with a chill as he pondered how to eliminate the two pests.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Li Xingteng fell silent. Having been the head of the largest sect in the Thunder Domain for years, he naturally knew today he was doomed. Yet he couldn’t help but feel reluctant; who wouldn’t fear death?

“Rest in peace. If the Thunder Domain doesn’t behave, I’ll send them to join you one by one! I, Luo Tian, am not a soft target that anyone can push around!” Luo Tian extended his hand. Under people’s astonished gazes, Li Xingteng turned into a wisp of smoke. A lightning-formed long bridge remained on the platform—this was the previous Thunder Bridge.

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, retrieving the Thunder Bridge into his storage bag. After all, it was a treasure of the Thunder Domain, far stronger than ordinary Sage-grade weapons.

He clenched his fists, radiating confidence: “Even without entering demonic cultivation, I can now kill a Sage Early Stage powerhouse. If I enter demonic cultivation, it would be complete domination. Even against a Sage Mid-Stage opponent, with the Shadow Fang Step and teleportation, I could escape effortlessly. Moreover, with the Shadow Fang Step’s speed, I could even match a weaker Sage Mid-Stage opponent and kill them. In the Ancient Heaven Palace, who could be my match?”

Luo Tian cast a glance at Feng Jiutian and others, then flew to Feng Jiutian’s side. He extended his hand: “Give it to me!”

Luo Tian’s voice carried a slight pressure, leaving Feng Jiutian no desire to resist. He knew today he had lost, thoroughly defeated by Diaodezhu and Luo Tian.

“Here it is!” His face bore a look of reluctance, handing the sealed vial containing Phoenix Ancestor’s essence blood to Luo Tian. His heart ached; it was the Phoenix Ancestor’s essence blood, with only three drops in total. Feng Jiutian could imagine the fate awaiting him upon returning to his clan.

“Being undefeated is so lonely! Alas, Feng Jiutian, I’ve warned you before. You insisted on gambling. Look at what happened by opposing me and the Ghost Sable Clan’s top talent! You’ve met your end!” Diaodezhu took small steps, hands behind his back. His golden collar from before still hung around his neck. His face bore melancholy, as if he had stabbed a knife into Feng Jiutian’s heart.

“Diaodezhu, today I’ve lost. But don’t be too pleased. What’s mine, I’ll eventually reclaim it!” Feng Jiutian spoke solemnly, wishing to devour Diaodezhu. He and Hu Xiangyang and Shi Hongtu left the crowd.

People’s faces bore reverence as they gazed at Luo Tian. Strength was always respected, especially when it came to someone so young who could defeat a figure like Li Xingteng. It was truly astonishing.

People knew that from today, Luo Tian’s name would spread throughout the Beast Domain and even other domains. Not because of his unparalleled alchemy skills, but because his strength was on par with the great masters.

“Brother Diaodezhu, this Phoenix Ancestor’s essence blood is of great use to me. Please let me take it; whatever conditions you have, just say them!” Luo Tian addressed Diaodezhu.

“Brothers and sisters! We are all on the same side. Take it!” Diaodezhu waved his hand generously. Naturally, he wouldn’t dare to argue with Luo Tian. After all, Luo Tian was the elder brother of the Dragon Ancestor. If Long Jie learned that he had asked for something from Luo Tian, it would be his skin peeled off. Today’s effect was also very satisfying for Diaodezhu; he had not only retrieved everything he had lost but also made a hefty profit from Feng Jiutian. Most importantly, it allowed him to show off, something he hadn’t done in a long time. His mood was excellent.

“We also need to return! Do you want to come with us? I’m currently staying in the Rhino Clan!” Diaodezhu addressed Jin Tianshu and Long Yongfu.

“Go, go, go! Returning to the clan isn’t interesting!” Jin Tianshu and Long Yongfu’s faces also bore admiration as they gazed at Luo Tian, quickly agreeing.

“Let’s go!” Diaodezhu, Jin Tianshu, and Long Yongfu linked arms. Under people’s reverent gazes, they led Luo Tian out of the crowd and the arena.

After leaving, people’s faces once again erupted in murmurs. Their eyes bore admiration and discussion of the events today. Soon, this astonishing gamble and battle spread throughout the Holy City, making Luo Tian’s name shine like the sun.

“Damn kid! Once we enter the Ancient Heaven Palace, I’ll show you!” The figures of the Divine Clan, looking disheveled, stood on the streets of the Holy City. They all looked indignant and cursed Luo Tian.

In the Holy Beast Pavilion, Sun Mengru listened to the bustling discussions around her. Her face bore a hint of confusion as she whispered, “Luo Tian… this name is familiar. Why can’t I recall it?”

“What’s wrong?” Sun Hexi looked at her with a kind expression, noticing her contemplative gaze.

“Nothing… nothing, Grandpa Hexi. That… who is Luo Tian? Why is he opposing our Divine Clan?” Sun Mengru was startled, her eyes filled with inquiry. She finally couldn’t resist asking.

Hearing Sun Mengru mention Luo Tian, Sun Hexi’s brows furrowed slightly. He thought of today’s incident when Luo Tian and Diaodezhu had stormed into the Holy Beast Pavilion. It was clearly aimed at Sun Mengru.

However, Sun Hexi, who had always doted on Sun Mengru, explained to her the details of Luo Tian’s conflict with the Divine Clan. Naturally, it was all Luo Tian’s fault.

“Hmph! This kid is really a bad guy!” Sun Mengru’s face bore anger. She felt her power surge as she heard about Luo Tian killing several Divine Clan elders.

“Early Sage Stage!” Sun Hexi’s face bore astonishment as he gazed at Sun Mengru. He hadn’t expected her to have such a rapid cultivation speed.

“Indeed, the Divine Clan’s chosen one! Such a cultivation speed is unmatched in the Nine Domains. The Primordial Divine Body truly is powerful!” Sun Hexi marveled, but a sorrowful feeling flickered in his heart. He thought of Sun Mengru’s fate.

“Don’t worry, Grandpa Hexi. Once I reach the Early Sage Stage, I’ll teach this Luo Tian a lesson and bring him back to the Divine Clan!” Sun Mengru waved her fists. Only before Sun Hexi did she show this naive side.

“Haha, a good child!” Sun Hexi patted Sun Mengru’s head gently. His affection deepened, but his sorrow grew more profound with each sigh: “Early Sage Stage, child. If possible, I hope you never reach the Early Sage Stage!”

Luo Tian’s name had only spread in the Beast Domain for two days before a thrilling event arrived as scheduled, completely overshadowing Luo Tian’s story.

The Beast Domain auction was held as planned. Everyone discussed the Beast Domain’s auction, which had never been so grand before. Even the Eight Great Divine Clans took action, with legendary beasts like the Flying Dragon and Phoenix circling above the Holy City.

People came and went, entering the vast auction hall. Those with power in the Nine Domains all rushed there.

Luo Tian and his group followed several important figures of the Rhino Clan into the auction hall, their faces filled with admiration. They were people of discernment who had attended auctions before but were utterly stunned by this one, which could be called the greatest auction in the Nine Domains.

“Come on, I’ll take you to a luxurious and exclusive package of the Ghost Sable Clan. It’s much better than the Rhino Clan’s!” Diaodezhu wore a triumphant expression, leading Luo Tian and others to a luxurious package. Just one of the Fox Clan’s attendants was dozens, all seductive and standing respectfully, making people blush.

“Tsk tsk, such waste! This huge package is only for you? It’s a waste!” Gu Lei and others marveled, their eyes filled with regret. Especially when they saw those dozens of seductive women, their faces bore envy.

“What’s wrong? You’re interested? If you want to marry her, I’ll go propose for you! With your Super-Expert Stage cultivation, it should be successful!” Diaodezhu saw Gu Lei and others drooling and spoke to them.

“Nah… no… no…” They quickly replied, looking was enough. If they actually got together, it would be hard to accept.

“Hmph! Cowards!” Diaodezhu’s face bore disdain as he instructed the attendants to bring food. A group of people ate heartily, filling the package with chaos. Du Yuying frowned slightly but soon joined in eating.

“Dong…” A deep sound echoed, like a bell but much louder.

“Everyone, welcome to our Beast Domain Holy City auction! I am Feng Clan’s elder, Feng Hongzhi. On behalf of the Eight Great Divine Clans, I welcome you all!” A curtain in the package emitted waves, reflecting the auction stage’s scene. The old man who had warned the Divine Clan outside the Holy City appeared in people’s sight, his face filled with a gentle smile.

Chapter 942: Star-Scattering Domain

Within the vast auction hall of the Beast Domain Holy City, Feng Hongzhi’s face bore a smile. He stood on the auction stage, his voice calm but immediately silencing the hall upon speaking.

The Feng Clan was currently the most powerful among the Eight Great Divine Clans, even surpassing the Dragon Clan after the Dragon Ancestor’s demise.

Feng Hongzhi smiled again, addressing everyone: “Alright, I won’t waste more time. I assume you’re all eager to start. Let the auction begin!”

After speaking, Feng Hongzhi slowly stepped back. After all, his status was too high; although the auction was grand, it wasn’t enough for him to preside over. He was there mainly to intimidate.

Soon, an old man from the Feng Clan in the Super-Expert Stage slowly stepped onto the platform. His face bore a smile, clearly a smooth operator.

“Friends from all domains, hello! I am Feng Yuanqing of the Feng Clan. I will be hosting this auction…” The old man spoke, briefly introducing himself before proceeding with the usual formalities.

Feng Yuanqing spent a long time on trivial matters, merely introducing rules similar to other auctions. The only difference was an equal exchange system and a panel of evaluators from the Eight Great Divine Clans. If one lacked enough Qi Stones, they could exchange other items after evaluation by the Eight Great Divine Clans.

“Alright! No more nonsense! Let’s see our first auction item!” Feng Jiutian, sensing people’s impatience, smiled and nodded to the back.

Feng Yuanqing’s words had just finished when two slim young women pushed a cart forward from the back. A red cloth covered it, emitting a holy aura beneath it, making people curious and excited.

Luo Tian and others stood in the package, observing the curtain. They knew that usually, the first auction item was something remarkable.

Feng Yuanqing’s eyes flickered with a hint of bitterness, but it passed quickly. He smiled professionally and grabbed the red cloth to reveal it.

Red light flashed, a phoenix’s cry echoed, and a scorching aura rose throughout the auction hall. People felt joy; just by sensing it, this item was no ordinary treasure.

In view, a fiery red phoenix’s illusion burst out of the cloth in an instant and gradually coalesced back into a weapon glowing with red light.

“This first auction item is a sacred weapon, the ‘Fengchi Liujin Spear’ from the Ghost Sable Clan’s prodigy, Diaodezhu!” Feng Yuanqing spoke softly, his gaze turning to Luo Tian’s package.

“Boom…” The auction hall erupted in chaos, people expressing astonishment and gazing at the Ghost Sable Clan’s package.

People were not surprised by the first auction item being a sacred weapon; they knew it was Feng Jiutian’s sacred weapon. Now, it had been put up for auction, clearly a slap in the face of the Feng Clan. Usually, those who submitted items wouldn’t reveal their names to avoid future trouble. However, Diaodezhu had strongly demanded the auction to announce his name, which was a major embarrassment for the Feng Clan.

“Diaodezhu!” In the Feng Clan’s package, Feng Jiutian clenched his teeth, his face as pale as death. He tightly gripped his fists, gazing at the radiant sacred weapon on the curtain with hatred.

Feng Jiutian’s status within the Feng Clan elders and ancestors had been gradually declining these days. Not only had he lost face, but he had also lost the Phoenix Ancestor’s essence blood. For the Feng Clan, this was a massive loss. A single drop of Phoenix Ancestor’s essence blood could allow a Feng Clan elder in the Sage Mid-Stage to reach the Sage Late Stage. This had been lost by Feng Jiutian, and not even his life had been taken—it was already generous.

Feng Jiutian hadn’t expected Diaodezhu to auction his sacred weapon, and it was done so openly. Clearly, this was a slap in the face of Feng Jiutian.

Luo Tian and others were also speechless, looking at Diaodezhu. This face-slapping was unexpected, even catching Luo Tian and others off guard.

Diaodezhu’s face bore a triumphant grin, seeing the admiration in Luo Tian and others’ eyes. His eyebrows nearly flew off his head.

“Little dog, you’ve got some brains! You have potential!” Gu Lei and Xu Lizi and others looked at Diaodezhu with satisfaction.

“Damn it, I’m not a dog! I am the noble Ghost Sable!” Diaodezhu glared at them and roared.

After a brief commotion in the package, they resumed watching the auction. After all, it was Diaodezhu’s item—a sacred weapon that could fetch a high price.

“This sacred weapon starts at five billion Qi Stones! The auction allows exchange with elixirs; a Super-Expert Stage初级 (Junior) elixir can offset five million Qi Stones, while a Super-Expert Stage中级 (Middle) elixir offsets one billion Qi Stones!” Feng Yuanqing spoke softly.

“Five billion five hundred million!” As soon as Feng Yuanqing’s words ended, the Feng Clan’s package saw Feng Jiutian report a price.

“Seems like the Feng Clan wants to buy this sacred weapon back!” People murmured, hearing Feng Jiutian’s bid.

Afterward, no one else placed a bid. Who dared? It was the Feng Clan’s item; if they had bid, it would surely anger them.

“Diaodezhu, you still don’t know your place! I’ll show you!” Feng Jiutian’s face bore a triumphant grin, gazing at Diaodezhu’s package.

“Haha! Five billion five hundred million to buy a sacred weapon—this is truly a bargain!” Feng Jiutian laughed heartily, his confidence high.

“Although he slapped my face, selling a sacred weapon for five billion Qi Stones is quite a loss!” People saw no one bidding and knew Diaodezhu had suffered a big loss.

Even the worst sacred weapon would cost tens of billions of Qi Stones, but it was sold at a low price. It was clearly a loss.

“Five billion five hundred million, once…” Feng Yuanqing sighed deeply, knowing no one would bid. He quickly started the countdown.

“Ten billion!” Before Feng Yuanqing could say “again,” a playful voice echoed throughout the hall, carrying a lazy tone.

People followed the sound, their faces filled with shock. Who else in the Holy City would dare defy Feng Jiutian’s face?

“Dragon Clan! It’s Dragon Prince Long Yongfu, a close friend of Diaodezhu!” People saw the Dragon Clan’s package.

“Long Yongfu, you’re really stingy! I’ll bid twenty billion!” Before Feng Yuanqing could speak, Jin Tianshu’s package from the Golden Winged Great Peng Clan spoke with a smile.

A murmur spread, people’s faces filled with shock. Everyone in the Holy City knew these princes often had conflicts and fought each other.

But those were private fights; no one expected them to fight in the auction hall.

“Good, good! Thirty billion!” Feng Jiutian’s face was grim as he glanced at the Golden Winged Great Peng Clan and Dragon Clan packages. His expression bore coldness.

Thirty billion was the maximum Feng Jiutian could afford. It was his years of savings. Previously, he had lost elixirs and sacred weapons to Diaodezhu but hadn’t used Qi Stones.

“Thirty billion, not enough! Thirty-five billion!” Long Yongfu’s voice echoed, clearly determined to slap Feng Jiutian.

“Forty billion!” Feng Jiutian gritted his teeth, borrowing ten billion from friends. This time, he had no more.

“Forty-five billion! Alas! So much money, I can’t help it!” Jin Tianshu’s voice echoed. Clearly, both were unafraid of escalating the bid. They had heard Diaodezhu’s transmission; they wouldn’t stop until he said so.

“Forty-five billion, a sacred weapon—this is likely the maximum price for this item. However, these princes clearly fought over it; maybe it could go higher!” People’s faces bore interest.

Other packages, other domain powers, wore contemplative expressions. Hearing their quarrel, they knew the Eight Great Divine Clans weren’t a united front.

“Damn it! I don’t want it!” Feng Jiutian smashed the cup on the table, his face twisted with hatred.

“Forty-five billion, once… forty-five billion, twice…” Feng Yuanqing sighed, knowing it had reached forty-five billion. The price was already high; he quickly sped up the countdown.

But just as Feng Yuanqing was about to say “three times,” a lazy voice echoed in people’s ears: “The weapon of the Feng Clan’s young master? It is worth collecting. I’ll bid fifty billion!”

“What?” People seemed to have heard wrong, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian and others also paused slightly. They had thought this sacred weapon would return to Diaodezhu’s hands, but no one expected another bidder.

“Haha! Good!” Diaodezhu jumped high, his eyes filled with excitement. He gazed at the package from which the voice came—not one of the Eight Great Divine Clans. Though it wasn’t as luxurious as those, it was still exquisite.

“Who is it? Daring to buy the Feng Clan’s item!” People gazed at the package, murmuring.

“Friend, dare to reveal your name so I know who is interested in my Fengchi Liujin Spear?” Feng Jiutian’s face was grim. He hadn’t expected others from other domains to dare defy him, and his aura gradually coalesced into an invisible storm, rushing toward the package.

“Hmph… is it yours?” A cold voice echoed, stars flickering, power radiating. It clashed with Feng Jiutian’s storm of aura. The package door slowly opened, revealing several figures.

A young man stood at the entrance, his eyes filled with mockery. His voice slowly echoed: “Star-Scattering Domain, Zhou Weilin!”

Chapter 943: The Indestructible Life Bamboo

“Star-Scattering Domain!” People gazed at the opened door, where a young man stood. His eyes gleamed with interest. This was his first time seeing people from the Star-Scattering Domain; he had known others from different domains hadn’t arrived yet due to long distances.

Now, seeing the Star-Scattering Domain appear, his eyes glowed with admiration as he scanned their figures.

“Early Sage Stage!” Luo Tian sensed Zhou Weilin’s strength, his mind surprised. This was the first time he had seen someone of his generation reach the Early Sage Stage.

“Not simple. I wonder if the Chaos Domain has arrived? And that mysterious Requiem Domain!” Luo Tian felt anticipation, looking forward to clashing with domain powers and elites in the Ancient Heaven Palace. His entire being was filled with battle spirit.

“Good! The Star-Scattering Domain truly is a major domain; they dare to take my Feng Jiutian’s item!”

Feng Jiutian’s face bore coldness as he addressed the Star-Scattering Domain group.

“This is an auction, not your private shop. Buying things relies on money. If it relied on power, what would be the purpose of us coming here? To wait for your leftovers?” Zhou Weilin showed no fear, speaking clearly. He won the favor of other domains immediately; even Luo Tian and others nodded in agreement.

“Jiutian, return! Star-Scattering Domain friends, this is my fault. I apologize first!” Feng Hongzhi’s voice bore a hint of anger as he scolded Feng Jiutian.
