“Thank you!” Luo Tian’s face showed a faint expression of gratitude as he spoke softly, his voice carrying a gentle warmth.

“You don’t need to thank me. I truly am not your match. If I could, I would have fought for it. The reason I accepted your teachings on expanding the dantian was to repay you a favor. If I reach the early stage of Sainthood, my words still hold: I will eventually reclaim you for the Divine Clan!” Sun Mengru spoke coldly, her gaze filled with battle fervor as she looked at Luo Tian.

“I will never be your enemy!” Luo Tian gently shook his head, his eyes sincere and deep as he gazed at Sun Mengru.

“Hmph!” Sun Mengru was inexplicably flustered by Luo Tian’s gaze, letting out a cold snort before turning her eyes elsewhere.

“Kid, you’d better not provoke trouble. This is the Divine Clan’s goddess—don’t let your thoughts wander. If you do something reckless, our Divine King won’t forgive you!” The Divine Clan members had long sensed Luo Tian’s improper attitude toward Sun Mengru, and now they threatened Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold light as he scanned the Divine Clan members, but he did not strike, unwilling to deepen Sun Mengru’s resentment toward him.

“Alright, since you two have settled your matters, this Epoch Bell now belongs to you!” The old man spoke softly, raising his hand. The sky’s Epoch Bell emitted a deep hum, shrinking continuously until it was the size of a palm and flew toward Luo Tian.

“Offer your blood, and that’s it. If the Epoch Bell acknowledges you, you become its master. If not, you’ll have to wait for the next opening and hope a fortunate soul claims it!” The old man explained, waiting for Luo Tian to claim the Epoch Bell.

Luo Tian wasted no time. He pressed his finger, and a drop of golden blood shot out from his fingertip, landing on the Epoch Bell.

At the moment Luo Tian’s blood touched the bell’s surface, it erupted with golden light, emitting a mournful sound. It hovered in midair, spinning rapidly. Golden runes sprang from its body, wrapping around Luo Tian before vanishing.

“It’s done!” As the golden runes disappeared, Luo Tian felt a new connection with the Epoch Bell, as if fate had intertwined them.

“Small!” Luo Tian chanted a hand sign. Golden light spread, forming golden runes that wrapped around the Epoch Bell’s body.

The palm-sized bell shrank again, resembling a small bell that floated before Luo Tian, emitting an affectionate aura. It finally wrapped around his hair.

“Alright, fate will bring us together again if we meet. If any of us claims the greatest treasure of the Heavenly Palace, we’ll see each other again. After these years of duty, it’s finally complete. From now on, this trial will no longer exist!” The old man’s face showed relief before vanishing from sight.

“Haha, the Epoch Bell! A pseudo-Epoch Treasure! Now our Four Sacred Star Domains also have a pseudo-Epoch Treasure!” Xu Liyi and others were overjoyed, gazing at the golden bell in Luo Tian’s hair as they spoke loudly.

Lu Han and Du Hongtao also wore faint smiles, clearly satisfied that Luo Tian had not disappointed them. The Epoch Bell ultimately fell into their group’s hands.

Previously, people from other domains had looked down on the Fire Domain and especially the Four Sacred Star Domains. Though the Fire Domain was renowned for its elixir arts across the nine domains, their overall strength had always lagged behind other regions.

Since entering the Demon Domain, Luo Tian’s actions had led him into the ancient Heavenly Palace, spreading his name across other domains. The names of the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain were once again brought into the spotlight.

“Bong…” As the old man’s words faded, a golden door slowly opened. People knew that the path to the next trial had been unlocked.

But soon, people’s gazes narrowed. A powerful scent of blood spread through their minds, real blood energy surging forth. Blood oceans rose to the heavens, making them feel an endless oppression as if hell’s gates had opened for them.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s gaze narrowed, staring at the golden door. His eyes flashed with violet light, but he could not discern what lay beyond the endless blood ocean.

Many hesitated, sensing that entering this blood door would likely mean no return.

“Enter or not?” Tian Luo and others gathered around Luo Tian, their gazes solemn.

“Wait for Zhan Biao to wake up before entering!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, unwilling to be trapped in the Heavenly Palace forever. He knew they would eventually have to enter.

The group nodded, then turned their eyes toward Chen Zhanbiao. But they suddenly noticed he was not lying on the ground, instantly alerting them.

“Mmm… mmm… delicious!” In a corner, a man glowing with golden light was devouring a roasted meat block, continuously chewing while occasionally tossing more stacked meat onto the碧green flame.

Luo Tian and others stared at Chen Zhanbiao in disbelief, smiling slightly. Xu Liyi approached Chen Zhanbiao and habitually smacked his head.

“Smack…” But in the next moment, Xu Liyi stumbled back two steps. Chen Zhanbiao looked at him with confusion.

Everyone’s eyes shifted to Chen Zhanbiao, all of them twitching their mouths as they watched him devour the meat block in three bites.

“That’s the Eight Great Clans’ meat! He actually dares to eat it. What’s his stomach made of?” People murmured, admiration in their eyes.

The Eight Great Clans’ people sealed and piled up by Luo Tian had now transformed into human forms. Their bodies were too massive, piling like mountains and drawing too much attention. It was better to stay low-key.

A group of people glared at Chen Zhanbiao, who was eating heartily. That meat was theirs—how could they not feel心疼?

Chapter 972: The Roast Feast

The second level of the Heavenly Palace was magnificent, but one scene disrupted its atmosphere.

Everyone’s mouths twitched as they watched Chen Zhanbiao, who seemed unaffected, devouring the roast meat. The aroma of roasted meat spread around, making people swallow their saliva.

“See? I told you this method was definitely effective!” Xu Liyi laughed, rubbing his numb hands and speaking to Luo Tian and others.

“Mmm… delicious! Brother, come over too. This meat is really good! I feel like I’ve become stronger after eating it!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke indistinctly, acting like a master inviting Luo Tian and Xu Liyi.

Hearing Chen Zhanbiao’s words, people were amused. They thought: “How could he not be stronger? Eating the meat of the Eight Great Clans is a first for him.”

“Haha, brother, don’t worry. We’ll have plenty of chances later. See those people over there? As long as we keep them by our side, meat will come endlessly!” Xu Liyi patted Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulder and grabbed a piece of meat from the flame, taking a bite.

“Ah… it really is nourishing!” Xu Liyi felt his body heating up, radiant light spreading from him.

Luo Tian and others also took no hesitation. Sitting cross-legged on the ground in front of Feng Jiutian, they roasted the mountain-sized meat blocks over the碧Jing琉璃 flame.

“Everyone, if you want to eat, just help yourselves. We’ll provide as much as you need!” Luo Tian called out to the surrounding people, trying to pull them into the feast.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the surrounding people twitched their mouths, looking at Luo Tian and others like a plague. Though they envied the phoenix meat and dragon meat, none dared to indulge.

Luo Tian’s group wasn’t afraid of the Eight Great Clans in the Demon Domain because Long Jie was there to suppress them. Even if they exited the ancient Heavenly Palace and appeared in the Demon Domain, Diao Yuanshan would protect them. As long as they weren’t killed, with Diao Yuanshan’s current status, he could likely protect them.

But these people had nothing. As scattered cultivators, who dared to oppose the entire Demon Domain?

Of course, there were exceptions. For instance, people from the Star Luo Domain arrived with smiles at Luo Tian’s group.

“Luo elder, without wine it’s not good. I have my Star Luo Domain’s fine wine!” Zhou Wei waved his hand, and坛坛 of wine appeared before everyone.

“Haha, great!” Luo Tian laughed heartily, pulling the Star Luo Domain people over. A group of them started a roast feast in the second level of the ancient Heavenly Palace.

“Damn, this is probably the first time since the Heavenly Palace opened!” People wore a hint of envy as they watched Luo Tian and others eating and drinking.

“Divine Clan friends, do you have any interest in having a drink?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with provocation as he addressed the Divine Clan.

“Why not!” Sun Mengru, seeing Luo Tian’s provocation, let out a cold snort and led the Divine Clan people toward the flame. She grabbed a phoenix meat from the fire.

The Divine Clan people showed no fear. They had been upset in the Demon Domain before, and now they had a chance to retaliate. Plus, the blood of the Eight Great Clans was indeed nourishing. Seeing Luo Tian and others glowing all over, they knew the benefits were immense.

Luo Tian didn’t invite the Demon Clan people. After all, Nan Gong Yuqing and Nan Gong Feibai were at odds. Unlike the Divine Clan, who only had a grudge with him.

A group of people ate and drank again under the eyes of others, clinking cups and enjoying themselves to the fullest.

Nan Gong Feibai’s face was dark. He glanced at Luo Tian and others, then looked at the blood-red mouth-like golden door, letting out a cold snort. His eyes showed determination as he stepped into the golden door.

Others, seeing Luo Tian’s group so lively, felt envy but restrained their urge to enter the door radiating endless blood energy.

The second level hall was left with only Luo Tian’s group, the Divine Clan, and Star Luo Domain people eating heartily. Of course, there were also the Demon Domain people sealed by Luo Tian.

“Can you tell me when you first met me?” Sun Mengru’s face remained cold, but possibly due to drinking wine, a faint redness appeared, making her irresistibly alluring.

“I said it was in the previous life. Do you believe me?” Luo Tian gently swirled his wine, raising his head and drinking it in one go.

“I believe you!” Sun Mengru nodded seriously. She couldn’t imagine when she had met Luo Tian.

Sun Mengru’s words surprised Luo Tian, his gaze filled with astonishment as he looked at her. If it weren’t for Sun Mengru, Luo Tian wouldn’t have invited the Divine Clan people over. After all, the Divine Clan was now his enemy.

“Because I have no friends! But with you, there’s a sense of familiarity!” Sun Mengru wore a faint melancholy. Her experiences over the years had made her reclusive. Today, speaking so much with Luo Tian was unprecedented.

“Divine Lady!” Sun Feiwen approached Sun Mengru, his face showing vigilance and respect.

“Ah… should we go?” Sun Mengru’s calm face showed a rare kindness toward Sun Feiwen.

“Yes!” Sun Feiwen’s body shimmered with golden light, his nose sweating. He had clearly benefited from the Eight Great Clans’ blood meat, his body glowing.

Sun Mengru had intended to ask Luo Tian more about her but nodded slightly and said nothing, walking toward the door leading to the next level.

“Thank you! After exiting the ancient Heavenly Palace, I’ll do my best to plead for you with the Divine Clan!” Sun Feiwen’s face showed a faint smile, knowing he couldn’t match Luo Tian in the ancient Heavenly Palace. Also, Sun Feiwen felt that Luo Tian had no ill intent toward Sun Mengru and even took care of her.

“Haha, no need. I’ve killed so many from your Divine Clan. The proud Divine Clan won’t forgive me!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. He still didn’t know how to deal with the Divine Clan, as Sun Mengru was in their midst. He couldn’t attack those around her, which would make Sun Mengru hate him.

“You don’t need to be so cautious. The Divine Lady has suffered greatly in the Divine Clan!” Sun Feiwen shook his head, not continuing. He turned and followed Sun Mengru.

Hearing Sun Feiwen’s words, Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly. His eyes were deep as he looked at the Divine Clan youths, his thoughts stirring.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian was thinking, a heavy atmosphere rose over the hall. A golden hand descended heavily toward Sun Mengru at the third-level door.

“Retreat!” Sun Mengru’s face changed, radiating brilliant light. Her gaze was heavy.

“Indeed, the blood meat of the Eight Great Clans is nourishing! It has allowed me to reach completion, and I’ve encountered the Saint’s Trial!” Sun Mengru muttered softly, her eyes showing a hint of anticipation.

“The Divine Lady is about to face the Saint’s Trial! Everyone, retreat. Don’t get caught in it!” Sun Feiwen showed a hint of anticipation, his gaze on Sun Mengru who had reached her peak condition.

“Primordial Body! Early Saint stage completed, late Saint stage achieved. According to legend, the fully achieved Primordial Body can withstand even a Saint’s peak power!” The Divine Clan members’ eyes flashed with brilliance, their gazes on Sun Mengru filled with endless anticipation.

“Not only that. The Divine King once said, after the Divine Lady reaches early Saint stage, no more than five equals in the nine domains could match her.”

“Ah! So it’s the Primordial Body!” Zhou Wei showed understanding, gazing at Sun Mengru who was slowly floating off the ground to face the Saint’s Trial.

“Primordial Body!” Luo Tian’s eyes also flickered slightly. He had long felt Sun Mengru’s body was extraordinary, otherwise she wouldn’t have reached this level so young. She was even more astonishing than himself.

Luo Tian’s mind recalled an ancient text in the Mountain and Sea Pavilion about the Nine Ancient Bodies.

In ancient times, there were eight powerful bodies that dominated their era. No one knew why they vanished into the river of time.

Some said these bodies were too rebellious, and thus the heavens erased them. Hence, those nine bodies vanished into time’s river.

“Reincarnation Body, Immortal Body, War God Body, Primordial Body, Harmonious Holy Body, Spirit Body…” Eight powerful bodies with unique characteristics but all undeniably strong, ruling that glorious era.

The Primordial Body ranked fourth among the eight divine bodies. Naturally, it was overwhelmingly powerful. Luo Tian couldn’t help but worry about Sun Mengru’s safety. After all, when he entered the Saint stage, he had barely survived his first Saint Trial. How could Sun Mengru, with such a good talent, fare better?

“Hope it’s better than I expected!” Luo Tian sighed softly, watching the golden Saint energy hand descend toward Sun Mengru.

“Come on!” Sun Mengru’s face showed boundless battle spirit. She stood tall in the air, her confidence evident. Her long hair flowed with elegance, and she clenched her hand, summoning the Divine Clan’s attack technique. A golden palm emerged from her hands, striking toward the Saint energy hand.

Two golden hands collided under people’s astonished gazes. Golden lightning exploded throughout space, radiating outward.

“Strong! It’s a level stronger than my first Saint Trial!” Luo Tian felt an ominous premonition. He thought of when he had provoked the heavens and survived his Saint Trial, feeling the killing intent from the heavens.

Although Sun Mengru had no resentment toward the heavens, her body itself was a rebellious Primordial Body. Naturally, it would be closely watched by the heavens.

Chapter 973: Strange Phenomenon

In the second-level hall of the Ancient Heavenly Palace, Sun Mengru was radiant. Her gaze focused on the golden hand that had凝聚 again with supreme power, her eyes narrowing slightly as she unleashed boundless battle spirit.

Her hands moved lightly, forming countless afterimages. A golden seal slowly formed from her hands, its power shaking the heavens.

“Divine King’s Seal! The technique of the old Divine King. I didn’t expect the Divine Clan to value this new Divine Lady so much, passing down the Divine King’s Seal to her!” Zhou Wei showed admiration, gazing at Sun Mengru who appeared like a fairy in white.

“Indeed, the technique of the Divine King!” Luo Tian and others also marveled, watching the powerful Divine King’s Seal in the sky.

It was said that the Divine King’s Seal was one of the three divine techniques of the old Divine King. It had subdued his contemporaries and eventually earned him the title of Divine King. Passing it to Sun Mengru showed how high her status was in the Divine Clan.

The sky-darkening golden hand finally凝聚, carrying a massive wave capable of annihilating any early Saint strength. It descended toward Sun Mengru.

The sound of collision echoed in all directions. The golden Divine King’s Seal clashed with the golden hand, neutralizing each other and creating a terrifying wave that nearly knocked everyone over.

“My three trials. I hope it doesn’t exceed mine!” Luo Tian’s face showed worry, watching Sun Mengru still standing proudly.

Although Sun Mengru stood confidently, facing two attacks capable of annihilating early Saint strength had drained her. Plus, she was at the center of the wave, taking the first hit. If it weren’t for the Epoch Bell’s awakening that had enhanced her strength, she might have already collapsed.

“Third one! Stay strong!” The Divine Clan people showed tension, praying for Sun Mengru. Luo Tian also furrowed his brows, watching the golden fist slowly凝聚 and prepared to act at any moment. He could feel this third Saint Trial was powerful.

“It’s coming!” Zhou Wei widened his eyes, watching the golden fist in the sky. It seemed to destroy everything, making people shocked.

“Facing mid Saint stage would still suffer heavy injuries!” Luo Tian’s eyes were solemn. He had seen this golden fist before during his trial, feeling a slight relief that Sun Mengru’s talent and strength would allow her to survive. But he remained tense.

“Boom…” The golden fist pierced the void, carrying supreme power toward Sun Mengru.

“I won’t submit!” Sun Mengru’s eyes flashed with cold light. Her forehead split open, spewing endless divine light that formed into countless brilliant swords, weaving together to form a sword net. It rushed toward the golden fist.

In an instant, the golden sword net captured the fist representing heavenly will, blocking its path.

Swords flew across the sky. The golden swords continuously attacked the golden fist, trying to dismantle its overwhelming power.

“Blocked?” The Divine Clan people showed great joy, watching the golden swords piercing through the golden fist.

But before their joy could finish, the golden fist emitted a burst of golden light. A heavy pressure spread instantly, breaking through Sun Mengru’s sword net.

Swords scattered in chaos, spreading outward and piercing the ground. People felt a shock.

“Spit…!” The sword technique was broken, Sun Mengru spat blood. Her eyes showed disbelief but before she could react, the golden fist struck her body.

“Crack…” Cracks appeared on Sun Mengru’s body, making her face paler. Blood flowed from the cracks, staining her white robe.

Sun Mengru’s entire body crashed down, heavily hitting the ground. Golden waves surged, obscuring people’s vision.

“Huff…” The Divine Clan people sighed deeply. Although Sun Mengru was severely injured, she was still alive. She had passed the three Saint Trials and become an early Saint strength. The Primordial Body was also slightly achieved. Even against Luo Tian, a top-tier talent, it was hard to say who would win.

Sun Mengru slowly stood up. Her wounds healed gradually, her clear gaze turning deeper. Divine essence continuously flowed from her body.

“Indeed, the Primordial Body is unmatched. Even if it could severely injure a mid Saint stage trial, it could withstand it. Such powerful flesh and bone—few in the world could match it!” The surrounding people, including Diao Dezhu, marveled, gazing at Sun Mengru.

“Hmph? Why hasn’t the Saint energy entered her body yet!” The Divine Clan people showed confusion, gazing at Sun Mengru with puzzled expressions.

“Because it’s not over yet!” Luo Tian whispered softly, gazing at the sky. He could feel a terrifying strike brewing above, like his third Saint Trial.

What worried Luo Tian was that he had only faced three Saint Trials. But Sun Mengru had drawn out the fourth, which surprised everyone.

“Rebellious!” Everyone’s hearts echoed with this thought. Even Long Jie, who had witnessed Luo Tian’s Saint Trial, shared the same idea. He thought Luo Tian was the most abnormal in the world, but Sun Mengru was even more abnormal than him.

“Indeed, the Primordial Body is renowned!” Zhou Wei showed admiration, gazing at Sun Mengru who slowly stood up, her eyes filled with defiance.

“I won’t submit. Heaven, I won’t submit! What is the Primordial Body? What are these talents? They’ve only brought me endless pain. I lost my parents, my relatives, and lived a lonely life. Now they stop me from entering the Saint stage. I ask you, why!” Sun Mengru raged, her long hair flying, her pale face filled with resentment. She roared toward the sky.

“Bong…” But the sky seemed to ignore Sun Mengru’s cries. A full moon slowly凝聚, pure and radiant, descending heavily toward Sun Mengru.

“Strange phenomenon!” People were shocked, gazing at the pure moon and exclaimed.

“Legend says only绝世 talents would produce strange phenomena during their trials. I didn’t expect to witness it!” Three factions exclaimed.

“I won’t submit!” Sun Mengru seemed to have lost her mind, radiating golden light. Her entire body was like a sword drawn from its sheath, emitting strong purification power without fear. She rushed toward the moon as if to destroy everything.

“Divine Lady, don’t be reckless!” The Divine Clan people shouted loudly. They could feel the Divine Lady had been in an abnormal state since entering the Ancient Heavenly Palace.

“Block it!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. If Sun Mengru were at full strength, she might have a chance of survival. But after three Saint Trials, her condition was clearly at its worst. She couldn’t withstand the moon transformed from a Saint Trial. This moon’s power was even more terrifying than his mountain.

Thinking this, Luo Tian moved swiftly. His幽冥鬼步 activated instantly, vanishing from the spot and breaking through space to appear before Sun Mengru.

Sun Mengru was still fighting. Suddenly, she saw a golden figure in front of her and was stunned. She wanted to stop but it was too late. Luo Tian had appeared too suddenly.

“Boom…” Sun Mengru’s sword clashed with Luo Tian, shaking his mind. He was pushed back, spitting blood. His eyes softened as he gazed at Sun Mengru.

Sun Mengru also trembled, her body emitting a crackling sound. It seemed she could collapse at any moment. Her body emitted a roaring sound.

“What are you doing!” Sun Mengru’s face showed anger, gazing at Luo Tian who smiled gently. She shouted out in question.

“I missed you once. I don’t want to miss again. You, are really hard to find!” Luo Tian’s face paled slightly but he forced himself to suppress his blood flow, speaking softly.

Sun Mengru felt a little nervous. But soon her eyes widened in shock and she exclaimed, “Beware!”

Luo Tian saw Sun Mengru’s eyes filled with fear. Her clear eyes reflected a full moon, and behind her was an immense pressure.

“Boom…” The pure moon descended with supreme heavenly power, smashing onto Luo Tian’s back.

“Luo Tian!” Diao Dezhu and others shouted loudly. In the distance, a full moon smashed onto Luo Tian’s back, appearing as if he carried a full moon.

“Spit…!” Luo Tian spat blood uncontrollably, scattering it onto Sun Mengru’s face. Her face was filled with fear.

“Boom…” The pure moon, along with Luo Tian and Sun Mengru, smashed into the ground. A shocking atmosphere spread through people’s minds.

The Ancient Heavenly Palace’s solid ground was also cracked by the moon, golden light spreading and obscuring people’s vision again.

“Would both of them be dead?” A half-Saint from the Divine Clan spoke, his voice trembling. He thought about what would happen if Sun Mengru died.

“Silence! The Divine Lady is unmatched. How could she die in a Saint Trial!” Sun Feiwen’s face was dark, scolding the young Divine Clan member with a furious voice.

“Cough… cough…” A low cough echoed into people’s ears, making their hearts relax.

“This cough is Luo Tian’s. The Divine Lady must be fine. After all, the attack was absorbed by Luo Tian!” The Divine Clan people sighed deeply.

Chapter 974: I Owe You

In the second-level hall of the Ancient Heavenly Palace, Luo Tian coughed blood heavily. Below him, Sun Mengru’s face showed disbelief as she gazed at Luo Tian.

Their eyes met. Sun Mengru’s eyes flowed with tears. For years, she had been cared for by someone other than Sun Hexi. In the Divine Clan, everyone avoided her like a plague, whispering she was a curse who had killed her parents. Every time she heard this, her heart felt like it was being cut with a knife. If Sun Hexi hadn’t given her warmth, treating her like a granddaughter, she didn’t know if she would have broken down.

Now, this youth had义无反顾 saved her despite claiming to know her past life. This made Sun Mengru’s heart, which had been frozen for years, slightly thaw.

“Was it worth it?” Sun Mengru’s face showed a smile like blooming flowers, making Luo Tian pause. He seemed to see the fragile woman from his past.

“Nothing is worth it or not. Everything I owe you. In the previous life, you lived alone until the end. This life won’t let you die. Even if it’s heaven, it can’t!” Luo Tian trembled as he stood up, his gaze filled with determination. He looked again at the sky.

“You…” Sun Mengru wanted to speak but didn’t know how. At this moment, she really wanted to know who she was in her previous life and what had happened.

But before Sun Mengru could think further, two suns suddenly brightened in the sky. They appeared like cold eyes in people’s sight.

“Done! Luo Tian’s involvement interrupted the Saint Trial. I wonder what terrifying Saint Trial will come next!” Diao Dezhu and others showed fear, gazing at the two suns in the sky.

“What is this? Another strange phenomenon?” The Divine Clan people gazed at the sky, their voices filled with shock.

“Indeed, it’s a strange phenomenon. The Eye of Heaven!” Zhou Wei, usually calm, finally showed fear.

Above the sky, two suns gradually dimmed their light. They actually transformed into real eyes, emitting a cold glow with golden lightning constantly weaving within.

“Come on! I can withstand one. I can withstand the second!” Luo Tian leaped into the air, his eyes filled with battle spirit. His body also emitted a roaring sound.

“Crack!” Golden lightning erupted from the deep and vast eyes, forming a sea of lightning that constantly fluctuated in the sky.

“Are these really the eyes of heaven? The lightning sea it emits is making me tremble, carrying supreme heavenly power!” People exclaimed, sensing the uniqueness of the lightning sea.

The lightning sea surged and gradually coalesced. Under people’s shock, the fierce lightning sea transformed into a human figure.

It seemed like the Thunder Emperor had returned, wielding divine punishment over all realms. Golden lightning robes obscured his entire body. The eyes of heaven rotated, one transforming into a golden long hair, the other into a golden shield.

“This must be a god!” Diao Dezhu and others showed disbelief, first seeing such an unusual creature.

“This isn’t a living being. It’s the will of heaven, manifested to destroy those who dare challenge it!” Zhou Wei showed fear, his voice trembling. He had read about this in ancient texts from the Star Luo Domain. Long ago, a talent had also challenged heaven and taken on a Saint Trial for others. In the end, he was pierced by a lightning spear and pinned in space, dying from being refined by thunder.

“Luo Tian is really in danger now! This lightning god has overwhelming power. Every strike carries supreme heavenly will, it’s no less than a division of heaven!” Zhou Wei continued to warn Luo Tian.

No need for Zhou Wei’s warning. At this moment, Luo Tian also felt a strong sense of danger in the lightning god above.

Lightning spear raised high, two flashes of lightning. In an instant, the golden lightning spear reached Luo Tian’s vicinity. The fierce energy instantly made Luo Tian focus. It was too fast, even with his幽冥鬼步, he couldn’t dodge it. The golden spear pierced Luo Tian’s shoulder, blood splattering out in large amounts.

Lightning spread from Luo Tian’s body, eventually entering his body. Blood flowed out of Luo Tian’s mouth again. His eyes showed a glimmer, gazing at the lightning god who had reformed the spear.

“Kill!” Luo Tian attacked. His梵天攻杀之术 was unleashed, tripling his attack power. He transformed into a streak of light and appeared beside the lightning god, thrusting his spear.

“Boom…” The void broke. The golden spear was blocked by the shield, sending out waves of lightning runes that spread outward into endless void.

Luo Tian instantly retreated, transforming into a streak of light before Sun Mengru. His white robe was stained with blood, making people shocked. A hole appeared on Luo Tian’s shoulder again.

“Strong! Among the enemies I’ve met, it ranks in the top three. It’s comparable to Yan Hongtao from the War God Domain, just slightly inferior. This lightning god has no intelligence.” Luo Tian calculated the lightning god’s strength in his mind, then moved again, transforming into a shadow and rushing toward the lightning figure.

Sun Mengru stared at Luo Tian fighting against the lightning god again, often falling behind. Her heart trembled more, her mouth unconsciously curving upward: “Feeling cared for is so good!”

Sun Mengru slowly stood up, her eyes showing determination. Her hands flickered slightly, emitting waves of brilliance. The power of the Dao flowed out from her hands, finally sketching a mountain and river map. It rushed toward the golden lightning god.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map! The second divine technique of the old Divine King!” Zhou Wei showed disbelief, gazing at Sun Mengru who was pale.

“Did this Sun Mengru receive the true teachings of the Divine King?” Zhou Wei showed disbelief. As a Star Luo Domain’s prince, he had heard some legends about the Divine Lady of the Divine Clan. All were mysteriously vanished, seemingly related to the old Divine King.

The Nine Heavens Map roared. It seemed like nine great continents, carrying a supreme pressure that pressed down on the lightning god. The heavy atmosphere even made people feel difficulty breathing.

Boom, the Nine Heavens Map fell heavily. Though it seemed light, it made the lightning god slightly intangible.

“Indeed, the three divine techniques of the Divine King. Looking at this, even if it summoned only three heavens’ power, it could make the lightning god slightly intangible! If it truly manifested nine great continents, who could withstand it!” Zhou Wei showed awe, gazing at the Nine Heavens Map and speaking loudly.

Others also showed amazement, gazing at Sun Mengru. She had mastered two of the Divine King’s three divine techniques. From any perspective, she was perfect.

Although the Nine Heavens Map was unparalleled, it only made the lightning god slightly intangible. Its long hair still carried overwhelming power, attacking Luo Tian.

“Dong…” A bell sound rang. Golden light erupted from Luo Tian’s hair, transforming into a bell-like Epoch Bell that spread out complex rune chains with terrifying waves. It also rushed toward the lightning god.
