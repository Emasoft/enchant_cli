“Do you dare to negotiate with me?” Luo Tian sneered, his long spear flying through the air as it severed the life of one of the Eastern Emperor Sect’s disciples.

“You…” The Eastern Emperor Sect’s Saint was stunned that Luo Tian had ignored his threat and killed one of his subordinates. The Eastern Emperor Sect’s Saint dared not kill the two ferocious beasts, for they were his last hope.

“Kill them! The people I wish to save have already been rescued!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly, his icy demeanor causing the Eastern Emperor Sect’s Saint to tremble.

“I’ll help you!” Luo Tian planted his foot on the ground, and before the Eastern Emperor Sect’s Saint could respond, he appeared in front of him and launched a punch.

“You…” Everyone was shocked by Luo Tian’s actions, even Long Jian and others who had been restored by the Bountiful Heaven Stone. The two ferocious beasts, Qing She and Tan Lang, were clearly known to Luo Tian—those who had followed Long Jian in the Great An Forest.

“Let them die!” Qing She and Tan Lang smiled, showing no resentment toward Luo Tian, for they knew there was no other way.

Boom…

Luo Tian’s fist struck the Eastern Emperor Sect’s Saint, sending him flying. Luo Tian stood where the saint had been, while Qing She and Tan Lang’s massive bodies were shattered by his fist’s wind, their blood splattering across the ground.

“Soul Summoning!” As soon as he appeared, Luo Tian extended his hand, and two wisps of blood mist rose. Two gray essences materialized before him, swiftly converging.

“Almost there!” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, gazing at the two exhausted souls.

Qing She and Tan Lang were too weak; Luo Tian was deeply worried that his fist’s wind might have destroyed them completely. If so, he would never be able to face Long Jian again.

Luo Tian’s body flickered as he carried the two exhausted souls into the Bountiful Heaven Stone’s barrier.

“Done!” Luo Tian sighed, restoring Qing She and Tan Lang’s souls. For him, this was effortless—so long as their souls remained, it posed no problem for Luo Tian or the Bountiful Heaven Stone. He ignored Long Jian and others, stepping out of the Bountiful Heaven Stone’s protection. The Eastern Emperor Sect’s Saint had already vanished.

“He ran?” Luo Tian sneered; as long as they remained in this small world, he would have another chance to eliminate them.

Only Gui Ming and Hun Xuan remained, standing there with complex expressions. Unknowingly, Luo Tian had pulled them further away.

Luo Tian’s gaze fell upon the massive Burial of Immortals Coffin, which blocked their view. It seemed to have absorbed the blood of Sikong Xing and those ferocious beasts, exuding an eerie aura. Within it, something terrifying was awakening.

“What exactly is buried inside?” Gui Ming asked, hesitating to touch the coffin.

“Let’s check around first,” Luo Tian frowned, unwilling to act rashly. He instinctively felt that even they, at the Transcendent King Mid-Stage, could not confront whatever lay within.

Luo Tian took a step forward; they had briefly opened the Burial of Immortals Coffin before, and he had found remnants of immortal pills inside, refining three currents of immortal energy.

Luo Tian knew there was an immortal skin within it—its origin was surely grand, not from the Nine Domains. The Burial of Immortals Coffin was large, but Luo Tian could still bypass it. After walking for some time, he circumvented the coffin.

“What…?” Luo Tian bypassed the coffin cautiously, as the coffin seemed to be a barrier. The scene beyond was filled with black mist, and he could not see its depths.

Luo Tian’s gaze turned to the distance, his body suddenly shaking—he saw another ancient coffin standing over ten thousand zhang away.

It was nearly the same size as the Burial of Immortals Coffin, and both seemed to echo with each other, suppressing something.

“Something’s wrong… what is this?” Luo Tian was baffled, unsure of the situation. He returned to the Bountiful Heaven Stone and recounted the events.

“What?” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice was heavy, as if lost in memory.

“Watch them closely; I’ll go check!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone spoke, then the red stone shrank and vanished from Luo Tian’s group.

Gui Ming and Hun Xuan had already left, leaving only Long Jian and Heihu. They had been puzzled for a long time; seeing no immediate danger, they quickly asked Luo Tian what had happened.

“Senior, the Nine Domains are gone; your survival is already a great fortune!” Luo Tian sighed, recalling how Long Jie had cried when he learned Long Jian and others were missing. He nearly broke his heart.

Luo Tian recounted the entire incident to Long Jian and others, who wore expressions of sorrow.

Long Jian and others sat in silence, their eyes filled with disbelief. Who could believe such news?

After a long pause, they regained composure. Long Jian sighed, “At least someone survived; we should be grateful. We ascended to the Immortal Realm immediately, otherwise, we would have reached our end!”

“Unfortunately, we can’t be as carefree as the Nine Domains in the Immortal Realm; we’re like ants!” Heihu and Tan Lang sighed.

“Don’t worry; in the Immortal Realm, we have the Tianyuan Sect—no one will bully us!” Luo Tian comforted them.

Boom…
As Luo Tian and others conversed, the Burial of Immortals Coffin before them emitted a deep rumbling. The massive lid trembled violently, causing Luo Tian to pale and his eyes to flicker with unease. He conjured several currents of lightning, forming a barrier around Long Jian and others. Luo Tian stood outside the barrier, gazing at the Burial of Immortals Coffin.

“It’s the Seven Star Linked!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“What does that mean?” Luo Tian asked, feeling the Bountiful Heaven Stone land on his shoulder.

“Run! I don’t know who opened the coffin, but whatever’s inside is from ancient times—something you can’t handle!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone shouted, and without hesitation, Luo Tian grabbed Long Jian and others, pulling them into his domain.

Chapter 2754: Reopening the Burial of Immortals Coffin

In the black mist, seven massive ancient coffins stood in a row. Each coffin had people standing before it; one of them was Diao Dezhu, Sun Kemin, and Yao Chenchen.

The black mist roiled around them as the coffin’s lid lifted halfway, releasing a powerful aura. The pressure pressed upon them, making their faces grim.

“Grave robbers—do you confirm there’s something valuable inside?” Diao Dezhu was overwhelmed by the immense pressure, gazing at the swirling black mist. A crackling sound echoed from within the coffin, as if something was gnawing at it.

“No… no problem! You must believe me—I’m a professional!” Sun Kemin opened an eye on his forehead, staring at the ancient coffin.

They had gathered here before, seeing the coffin and driving off two Hell Sect disciples. After that, Sun Kemin had become envious, his professional instincts taking over. He devised a plan and finally opened the coffin.

“I’ll check what’s inside!” Yao Chenchen felt the overwhelming pressure and leapt into the air.

“Don’t go!” Sun Kemin shouted, but it was too late—Yao Chenchen’s body had already appeared above the coffin.

At that moment, a massive black hand descended from the coffin, crushing toward Yao Chenchen.

Yao Chenchen’s eyes shifted; he swung his staff at the hand, but to his horror, even with all his strength, it failed to break through.

Boom…
A dull sound echoed as Yao Chenchen’s body was crushed, spitting blood violently. He crashed into the ground with a powerful explosion.

“Monkey Brother!” Diao Dezhu appeared beside Yao Chenchen, watching his battered form.

“Run… quickly!” Yao Chenchen gasped, blood spewing from his mouth as if all his bones had shattered.

“Sun Kemin, I curse your mother! What did you unleash?!” Diao Dezhu cursed, the first time he had seen Yao Chenchen so helpless.

“Run!” Sun Kemin shouted, shaking off his short legs and realizing he had caused trouble.

Crash…
Sun Kemin continuously hurled yellow talismans, sticking them to the coffin. His body vanished from the spot.

Diao Dezhu carried Yao Chenchen, his body flickering as he chased after Sun Kemin with Wan Lingkong and Chen Zhanbiao.

In an instant, they retreated tens of thousands of miles but still felt danger. Yao Chenchen was considered invincible among them; no one could suppress him except Luo Tian.

Mighty—this was how they defined Yao Chenchen. Now, this mighty figure had been wounded by a single slap.

Boom…
As they just left, the yellow talismans Sun Kemin had hurled shattered one by one. The black ancient coffin emitted a deep rumbling, and the lid, half-opened, flew off with a thunderous crash.

At the same time, the other six coffins also rumbled, their lids trembling violently, emitting terrifying pressure.

“What happened?” Others beneath the seven coffins also stood there—Hell Sect and Immortal Realm figures.

“Run! My instincts tell me this coffin is no ordinary thing!” Ye Liangchen shouted to Jiang Yuzu and Ye Chen, their bodies flickering as they left the massive ancient coffin.

This scene unfolded beneath all seven coffins, and everyone felt a change, fleeing toward the Thunder Sea Marsh.

Luo stood outside the Thunder Sea, gazing at the direction of the Seven Star Linked coffins. His aura surged into the sky, swirling winds and clouds.

“How are they doing?” Luo worried; he had run over but hadn’t seen Diao Dezhu or Sun Kemin.

As Luo worried, a ball-like figure appeared in his vision, making his eyes brighten—was it Sun Kemin?

“Luo!” Sun Kemin was overjoyed, landing before Luo, sweat pouring from his forehead.

Sun Kemin had just landed when Diao Dezhu and others appeared as well. Luo saw Yao Chenchen, severely wounded.

“What happened?” Luo frowned; he didn’t think the Hell Sect disciples or Immortal Realm disciples could have left Yao Chenchen so battered.

“It’s that grave robber! Wang An had a breakdown and insisted on opening the Burial of Immortals Coffin!” Diao Dezhu cursed, kicking Sun Kemin.

“Surely it’s you, that bastard!” Luo muttered after Diao Dezhu recounted the events.

Luo had long suspected it—this Burial of Immortals Coffin was unlike others; no one could open it. Among those who had entered, only Sun Kemin possessed the ability.

“You’ve got guts—were they eaten by dogs!” Luo muttered, taking out a pill and giving it to Yao Chenchen.

Several figures appeared; Jiang Yuzu and Ye Liangchen landed before Luo’s group. The Immortal Realm and Hell Sect people were separated but kept a safe distance from Luo.

“Luo Senior!” To Luo’s surprise, two figures appeared—Shanhai Palace’s Saint and Zhou Zhiwen.

“What happened?” They asked, looking to Luo for answers.

“I don’t know!” Luo shook his head; they had lived in the Nine Domains but hadn’t expected such a presence.

Boom…
As they conversed, deep rumbles echoed. The black mist completely obscured their vision.

The seven massive black coffins’ lids fully lifted, and a powerful suction force emerged from the coffins, absorbing all the black mist.

“This…”

“It’s the aura of an Emperor!” Ye Qiu gasped, eyes wide with disbelief. Even from a distance, they felt the overwhelming pressure. The suction force pressed upon Luo’s group, scattering sand and stones; the entire land turned chaotic, and even more so, the massive Thunder Sea behind them twisted and was pulled toward the Seven Star Linked direction.

The entire land seemed on the brink of annihilation; Luo’s group resisted the powerful suction, their hearts trembling. The sky roared, and the terrifying aura grew stronger, shaking the entire land. Even Luo’s rule power, which he had to suppress at Transcendent King Mid-Stage, changed.

“Can change rules!” Luo’s heart trembled; the thing awakening before him was undoubtedly the most terrifying he had ever encountered.

“It’s an Emperor’s Soul! Only an Emperor’s Soul can change rules!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in Luo’s mind.

Chapter 2755: Thunder Cloud Emperor

The land trembled; seven storms swept into the seven ancient coffins, lasting a quarter of an hour. The ground seemed scraped by something.

“The Thunder Sea is gone!” Luo’s eyes widened in disbelief; the ground was covered with laws, and on it lay a pile of bones.

The bones were neatly arranged, like dragon-like formations; nine bone dragons surrounded each ancient coffin.

“We’ve left that dangerous place!” The Hell Sect and Immortal Realm people looked around, realizing the danger they had escaped.

Crackling…
Luo’s body crackled with electricity, seven-colored lightning swirling around him. He was startled because the Thunder Cloud Flower he and the Bountiful Heaven Stone had refined together wanted to break free from his body.

“Damn, I understand now!”

“This place buries the Thunder Cloud Emperor; that’s why there are seven-colored thunder clouds and a Thunder Sea! It must be the six-colored Thunder Cloud Flower from the Thunder Cloud Emperor!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice was incredulous in Luo’s mind, sending waves of shock through him.

Not only Luo, but others also trembled; a certain opportunity was triggered by some fluctuation.

Black and white qi surrounded Ye Qiu, who looked grim as he quickly cultivated to suppress it.

“What’s going on?” Everyone’s minds trembled, gazing at the now-clear seven ancient coffins.

Crack…
As people were stunned, nine bone dragons began to violently move, swirling toward the coffins as if trying to wrap them.

“Now you want to seal me?” As the bone dragons moved, a deep and cold voice echoed across the land.

“Nine Dragon Sealed Coffin—this is the legendary Nine Dragon Sealed Coffin!” Sun Kemin shouted, his eyes widening. Luo and others could now see the eyes of the coffin.

“My god, we’re doomed!” Sun Kemin muttered repeatedly, his body trembling as he thought of something terrifying.

“What’s going on?” Diao Dezhu and others looked at Sun Kemin, who had already started to retreat.

“Nine Dragon Sealed Coffin—grave robbers must not be greedy!”

“This is a term in our trade. When encountering such things, one must run as far as possible; once released, it will result in mass death!” Sun Kemin spoke. Hearing this, Diao Dezhu and others gasped, realizing the severity of the situation. In their minds, Sun Kemin was average in strength but obsessed with coffins—no coffin was too scary for him. Yet now, he was terrified.

“If I saw the Nine Dragons, I wouldn’t dare open any coffin!” Sun Kemin shouted, nearly crying.

“You bastard are going to kill us all!”

“Do you have a way to deal with this Nine Dragon Sealed Coffin? Or did you ever explain how to handle it?” Luo asked.

“Yes!” Diao Dezhu replied, making Luo’s group’s eyes brighten.

“Run… as far as you can!” Sun Kemin replied, but this made Luo’s group want to strangle him.

“I really want to strangle you!” Wan Lingkong gritted his teeth; this answer was as useless as a fart. If they could run, they would have already done so. Everyone knew the aura was this strong; if it truly emerged, none of them would be its match.

“Has it come out?” Luo and others stood a hundred miles away, a figure standing there with deep eyes, gazing at the seven coffins without moving forward.

Crack…
Each bone dragon turned into fragments, flying outward with tremendous force, piercing through the void.

“Ten Thousand Sword轮回界!” Luo quickly conjured a domain to block the fragments flying outward.

The fragments rained down, colliding with Luo’s domain; each could shatter a soul.

“This is impossible to fight!” Diao Dezhu and others felt their hair stand on end; even these fragments could kill a half-step Transcendent King.

“Damn it, I’ll try—this is my territory; they all must obey me!” Sun Kemin’s eyes flashed madness. Luo and others saw excitement in his mad gaze, like when they had opened the Burial of Immortals Coffin.

“Don’t be reckless!” Luo pulled Sun Kemin back, and they retreated again to the edge of the former Thunder Sea.

“Let’s go back!” Luo sighed; this place was no longer suitable for them. The Nine Domains’ World Heart was important, but to Luo, their lives were more crucial.

Luo had decided to leave; whatever was inside was definitely beyond their ability. They needed to return to the Immortal Realm.

At this moment, Luo and Yao Chenchen had recovered to Transcendent King Late-Stage, clearly influenced by the entity within the coffin. Rules had changed.

Luo did not want to face this being; he believed no one would dare.

Seven figures, slightly transparent, gathered on the seven coffins—identical middle-aged men standing there, gazing around.

“Even if I was sealed for millions of years, I’ve still awakened!” The seven transparent figures moved toward the center.

“Indeed, it’s the Thunder Cloud Emperor!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone gasped, confirming who this middle-aged man was.

“Is it the Seven Souls?” Luo whispered, taking out a scale and infusing his cultivation to sense Shanhai Palace’s location.

“Who is this man? I feel his strength surpasses the Grand Master!” Ye Qiu and others gasped, watching the seven transparent figures merge into one.

“Could it be… an Emperor?” The Immortal Realm people trembled, their sects had once had Emperors, so they understood Emperor’s aura.

As Luo and others prepared to retreat further, the seven middle-aged figures walked forward, merging into one. Their aura intensified; they opened their eyes and gazed at Luo’s group.

“Oh? There are old friends?”

“Bountiful Heaven Stone!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor shouted, a wave of anger sweeping across the land.

“Do you know him?” Luo’s heart dropped, transmitting to the Bountiful Heaven Stone.

“Know him? I remember that those who sealed the Thunder Cloud Emperor were closely related to me!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone replied, his voice carrying bitterness.

“Truly…” Luo didn’t know what to say; he and Diao Dezhu rushed toward the dark sky, no matter where they appeared, it would be better than facing this Thunder Cloud Emperor.

“Want to run? Back then, the Bountiful Heaven Stone sealed this place—how powerful!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor sneered, raising his hand.

Chapter 2756: The Might of the Thunder Cloud Emperor

Under the sky, a solid figure stood there. Though it was just a residual soul, its aura made Luo’s group tremble.

“How strong must he have been in life? A residual soul already makes me feel unable to resist!” Wang Xiu gasped, his body constantly retreating.

The Thunder Cloud Emperor’s residual soul waved its hand; the ground trembled, and countless laws instantly appeared in the sky, as if sealing the entire land.

“Sealing one person has sealed this land!” Luo stopped, having planned to tear through the sky. But now he found this sky could not be torn.

Everyone’s faces were grim; the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s aura was too strong, surpassing their comprehension. It was stronger than any Transcendent King they had seen.

“Did you dare to touch my Thunder Cloud Flower?” The Thunder Cloud Emperor gazed at Luo, sensing the aura of the Thunder Cloud Flower on him.

“Come here!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor extended his hand, a wave of energy appearing on Luo’s body, making him grimace.

“Get lost…” Luo roared; he knew there was no escape now. The Thunder Cloud Emperor clearly intended to destroy him and the Bountiful Heaven Stone.

The aura of a Soul Sealing Master erupted, as Luo knew the opponent was a soul; as long as it was a soul, the Soul Sealing Master could suppress it—though the strength varied.

As Luo’s aura erupted, it had some effect; the suction on him was negligible.

“Hmm?” Seeing Luo stop his body, the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s eyes flickered slightly, showing interest.

“Extraordinary bloodline—flowing with轮回血 (Reincarnation Blood), no wonder the Bountiful Heaven Stone followed you!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor whispered, stepping into the void and taking a step forward. He pointed his finger at Luo.

One strike caused the earth to tremble, though it was not physical; that wave of energy made Luo’s face grim.

“Six Paths Reincarnation!” Luo roared, unable to resist and launching his full strength with the Six Paths Reincarnation Fist.

Boom…
A dull sound rose before Luo, and he was sent flying back, spitting blood. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

At this moment, Luo understood why Yao Chenchen had been severely wounded; the Thunder Cloud Emperor was a soul but its strength surpassed even Transcendent King Peak.

“His strength should be at the Half-Step Immortal Emperor level; it’s slightly weaker than a true Half-Step Immortal Emperor, but three Transcendent Kings at Peak would not be able to fight it.” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in Luo’s mind.

“Have I become so weak?”

“A single Transcendent King Late-Stage could not kill him!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor sighed.

“Bountiful Heaven Stone, why haven’t you come out? You’ve changed masters after so many years. Where is Wind Emperor?” The Thunder Cloud Emperor gazed at Luo but was speaking to the Bountiful Heaven Stone.

“Back then, there were people who sealed me; now you’ve caught me, I’ll definitely turn you into a puppet and kill you!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor flickered his body, becoming a lightning bolt and appearing beside Luo again.

“Damn it!” Luo cursed, his spear materializing in his hand and launching a piercing strike.

Boom…
This time, Luo’s body was sent flying again; his powerful piercing strike had no effect on the Thunder Cloud Emperor. People could clearly hear the sound of Luo’s body cracking.

It hurt to listen; Ye Qiu and others watched Luo fall to the ground, their mouths twitching.

“Don’t come out yet?” The Thunder Cloud Emperor frowned, gazing at Luo’s direction. He feared the Bountiful Heaven Stone most.

“Luo, hold on!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone continuously encouraged Luo, making him curse inwardly: “What am I supposed to hold on with? Who can withstand it!”

“Sword of Heaven’s Ascension!” Luo roared, a gray soul sword materializing before him. He raised his hand and launched it, slicing through the earth with a brilliant sword beam toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

“Interesting!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor spoke lightly, still calm. He flipped his hand and a massive hand descended from the sky, grabbing the gray sword beam.

Crack…
In Luo’s trembling gaze, the sword beam he had conjured with soul energy was shattered by the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s hand.

“My god, the three techniques of the Fallen Immortal King were shattered so easily!” The Immortal Realm people gaped in shock.

“This is Luo, and he’s even recovered to Transcendent King Late-Stage! Yet he couldn’t fight back!” People looked at him with disbelief. Though they believed the Thunder Cloud Emperor was strong, seeing it firsthand was another matter.

“Sword of Downfall!” Luo struck again, the second technique suddenly unleashed. A gray sword beam emitted a crackling sound and slashed toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

“Break!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor spoke lightly, exhaling and sending a black lightning bolt descending from the sky. It collided with Luo’s sword beam.

Puke…
The sword beam shattered again, and blood spewed from Luo’s mouth like water. His body stood trembling.

“Good!”
“But you’re still too weak, Bountiful Heaven Stone! If you don’t come out soon, your master will die!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor spoke, trying to force the Bountiful Heaven Stone out.

“Destroying Immortals!” Luo roared, his gray long sword reappearing in his hand. His painful body moved again, and a series of gray sword beams flew out, quickly gathering around the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

“I didn’t expect you to have another technique!”
“This is truly unexpected; after being sealed for so long, I met such an interesting person. It’s rare!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor smiled lightly, watching Luo wield the Destroying Immortals Sword Array. He let those sword beams surround his body.

Ten… one hundred… one thousand…
A thousand two hundred sword images suddenly rose, surrounding the Thunder Cloud Emperor and making his face dark.

“Destroying Immortals Sword Array!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor gasped, his eyes filled with disbelief. He hadn’t expected Luo to know the Destroying Immortals Sword Array.

The Thunder Cloud Emperor was infamous in ancient times, sealed by four Immortal Emperors. But compared to the Demon God Xing, he was still inferior; their standings in ancient times were different.

For the Destroying Immortals Sword Array that had destroyed Xing, the Thunder Cloud Emperor was familiar. His name had shaken countless ages. The Thunder Cloud Emperor finally became serious, extending his hand to grab a human skin from one of the Burial of Immortals Coffins. It covered the sword array, enveloping the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s body.

The skin stretched out, forming a middle-aged man with an icy face. Another coffin emitted thunderous sounds.

Crack! A lightning bolt shot out, landing in the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s hand, radiating a powerful aura.

“Cut!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor raised his hand and slashed, golden lightning cutting through a vast number of sword beams. Luo’s face turned pale.

Chapter 2757: Confronting the Thunder Cloud Emperor

Within the Destroying Immortals Sword Array, the Thunder Cloud Emperor remained calm. Each time he wielded his lightning sword, it shattered a large number of sword beams, making Luo’s face pale.

“Too far behind!” Luo sighed inwardly; he felt the Destroying Immortals Sword Array wouldn’t last long. After all, the opponent was a great power.

“Too strong! If this powerful being were to leave, who could stop him?” Ye Qiu and others trembled in their hearts.

“Are you going to watch this? Do you think this guy would let you go?” Luo gazed at Ye Qiu and others. If they used their full strength, there was still a chance to kill the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

Hearing Luo’s words, Ye Qiu and others fell silent, watching the Thunder Cloud Emperor shatter sword beams within the Destroying Immortals Sword Array.

“Haha, you think these ants can defeat me?”
“I was an Emperor before; killing you is like slaughtering chickens!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor laughed scornfully, seeing Luo try to unite with Ye Qiu and others.

“But what if I join?” However, before the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s words finished, a mad voice rose from above him. A red meteor fell, radiating an aura that suppressed everything, crushing toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

“Bountiful Heaven Stone, I’ve been waiting for you!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor’s face darkened but remained calm. He slashed his lightning sword toward the Bountiful Heaven Stone.

Boom…
A powerful explosion echoed, and the red meteor was sent flying back; stone fragments scattered. The Bountiful Heaven Stone vanished from everyone’s sight.

“Painful!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in the air, making it impossible to locate his position.

“You’re still a piece of trash; if it weren’t for Wind Emperor, you would’ve been thrown into the toilet!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor’s body also collapsed a part.

Crack…
Three sword beams shattered on the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s body, but he seemed unaffected, continuing to cut through more sword beams.

“A skin and seven souls—this is already so powerful!” Luo sighed, unable to help but admire the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s might.

“You all fight together; this madman is abnormal, extremely violent and bloodthirsty, hence why four Emperors joined to seal him!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in their ears, causing chaos.

“If it’s true, then we must destroy him!” Ye Qiu muttered to himself, his heart conflicted. This was a great power; none of them could fight it alone. If the Bountiful Heaven Stone’s words were false, they would have offended the Thunder Cloud Emperor, a man strong enough to destroy any of their阎罗十殿 (Yan Luo Ten Palaces). If they could make peace, no one wanted to offend him.

“You all decide!” Luo coldly watched them; regardless, he had to fight because the Thunder Cloud Emperor had targeted him. He also believed the Bountiful Heaven Stone wouldn’t lie to him.

“Damn it, this is my domain; who gave you the right to boss around here!” Sun Kemin roared, standing there and gazing at the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

Boom…
Sun Kemin held a hand drum in his hands; its surface was old, engraved with strange patterns. He bit his finger, and blood formed an imprint on the drum’s surface, disappearing into it.

Ding…
Then Sun Kemin took out a copper bell, producing a ringing sound. Diao Dezhu and others looked at him with confusion.

“What’s this style? I’ve never seen it used before!” Diao Dezhu asked.

“Get to work! I’ll set up the array!” Wan Lingkong ignored Sun Kemin’s words and flew into the air, inserting a talisman flag at his feet. Because Luo had already raised his broken sword, Destroying Immortals, and rushed toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor again.

“Senior Brother, I’ll help you!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, his body exploding with power. His wild aura burst forth as he stepped toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

“Truly a powerful opponent!” Yao Chenchen, who had been silent until now, stood up. His golden staff radiated ten thousand golden lights and expanded violently toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

Luo, Chen Zhanbiao, and Yao Chenchen stood together, clashing with the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

The sky roared; the earth trembled. A violent fluctuation threatened to destroy this land.

Luo and others were strong—Transcendent King Late-Stage, with the ability to survive against a Transcendent King Peak. But they were still suppressed by the Thunder Cloud Emperor, and this was only because the Bountiful Heaven Stone continuously attacked from the side.

“Bountiful Heaven Stone, you and I hold on for a while; I’ll open the Demon Body Destruction!” Luo shouted, blood spewing from his mouth as he was slashed by the Thunder Cloud Emperor. His feet smashed into the ground, creating a large pit.

People gazed at the battle between Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chenchen, their hearts trembling. They were torn—should they intervene?

Most watched with a wait-and-see attitude, observing Yao Chenchen and Chen Zhanbiao’s attacks on the Thunder Cloud Emperor with the Bountiful Heaven Stone.

“Fight!” Ye Liangchen roared, stepping on the ground and flying into the air. He raised his hands, stars falling; nine stars roared toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

“Trash!” The Thunder Cloud Emperor swatted his hand, and nine stars were crushed instantly by the Thunder Cloud Emperor. It didn’t end there; he hit Ye Liangchen as well.

Ye Liangchen came quickly and left just as fast, falling from the sky into the ground and never rising again.

“Kill!” Jiang Yuzu and Ye Chen rushed forward, joining the attack on the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

Zhou Zhiwen’s eyes flickered with thought, but he finally bit his lip and flew into the air. He held a jade fan in his hand, flipping it to unleash a storm toward the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

Su Yuquan also flew into the air, his eyes filled with battle spirit. He moved his hands, and waves of water surged into dragon-like forms, attacking the Thunder Cloud Emperor.

Several figures finally distracted the Thunder Cloud Emperor’s attention. The Thunder Cloud Emperor remained calm, facing several Saint-level figures with just one lightning sword.

Boom…
More people fell from the sky, their descent like rain. Within a short time, everyone was coughing blood; some couldn’t hold on.

“It’s too late—I choose to believe!” Ye Qiu’s eyes flickered slightly; among these people, those with weaker strength had dared to challenge the Thunder Cloud Emperor. He didn’t want to lose to anyone, even Luo Tian.

Crack…
A sound echoed from Luo’s body as his aura surged wildly, emitting a terrifying power.

“Kill!” As Luo opened the Demon Body Destruction, a voice filled with killing intent echoed in his ears, making people’s eyes widen in disbelief.

A cold glint rose, but it wasn’t aimed at the Thunder Cloud Emperor—it was aimed at Luo standing there.

“Damn it!” Luo cursed inwardly, not realizing that someone was attacking him at this moment. The timing was perfect.

Chapter 2758: Sun Kemin’s Transformation
