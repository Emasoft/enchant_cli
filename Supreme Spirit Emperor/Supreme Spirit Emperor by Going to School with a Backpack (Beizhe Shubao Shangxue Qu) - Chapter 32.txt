“Chen Changsheng, Luo Tian, today’s humiliation I Ying Hongtu have recorded!” Ying Hongtu’s voice was as if squeezed from between his teeth.

Bai Zhantian and Rong Da exchanged a glance. Among the three, Ying Hongtu was the most fearless against Luo Tian due to his formidable speed, yet even he had chosen to retreat. What then remained of their strength against Luo Tian’s duo?

Chapter 151: Battle Against Chen Changsheng

Chapter 151: Battle Against Chen Changsheng

In the Northern Expanse of Tianyuan Continent, countless sects—great and small—spread across the land.

Xuanyin Sect was one of these first-rate sects. Though its numbers were but a mere tens of thousands, fewer than even some second-rate sects, Xuanyin Sect stood among the first-rate sects due to its reputation as the most renowned assassination sect in the Northern Expanse.

At that moment, on Xuanyin Mountain, where an icy killing aura permeated the air, within a grand hall, rows of jade tablets lay upon tables. Each tablet bore the names of individuals revered within Xuanyin Sect—those whose fates were enshrined here.

As assassins, all faced the possibility of death. Yet the demise of a seed-level assassin was a grievous blow to Xuanyin Sect.

Perhaps due to their confidence in their sect’s killers, no one guarded the hall. Only a lowly servant lay slumped over the table, sound asleep.

“Crack…” A shattering noise echoed through the hall, jolting the sleeping servant awake. His eyes merely twitched before he resumed his slumber.

Moments later, the servant abruptly opened his eyes, as if recalling something. He scanned the jade tablets.

After a while, his gaze settled on the shattered tablet. Upon seeing the name etched upon its fragments—Wang Siyuan, Xuanyin Sect’s prodigy—the servant’s breath quickened. Sleepiness vanished.

The name on the tablet was Wang Siyuan, and the servant envisioned Xuanyin Sect’s entire assassin force mobilizing.

Without hesitation, he stumbled toward his superior to report the news.

Not long after, Wang Siyuan’s death reached Master Du Yongchang of Xuanyin Sect. Upon confirming the tablet had shattered, Du Yongchang’s face contorted in fury. His wings flared as he soared toward Xuanyin Sect’s rear mountain.

“Ah… who killed my grandson! No matter who you are, you must die!” Soon after Du Yongchang reached the rear mountain, a heart-wrenching cry echoed across Xuanyin Sect.

Though Xuanyin Sect’s disciples were cold-hearted killers, the mournful cry carried a killing aura that made them shudder.

After the wail faded, a black figure materialized above Xuanyin Sect before vanishing instantly.

……

Luo Tian and Chen Changsheng watched the three depart, then turned to face each other. Their gazes ignited with battle intent.

Luo Tian extended his hand, drawing the Rending Sky Spear. His expression was grave as he faced Chen Changsheng. Chen Changsheng, the strongest in the Cultivation Body realm that Luo Tian had encountered, demanded his utmost focus.

Both men were exhausted from their prior clash.

Chen Changsheng’s whip had restored to its former state. His gaze was equally wary, for since his emergence, Chen Changsheng had never known defeat—this reinforced his belief in his invincibility at his level.

Though confident, he dared not underestimate Luo Tian. If not necessary, Chen Changsheng would avoid confrontation.

Yet the Spirit Pulse, the Great Cauldron, and the Storage Ring were all irresistible temptations. This compelled him to take a risk.

Luo Tian could no longer restrain himself. The Rending Sky Spear flashed like lightning, forming a golden serpent that lunged at Chen Changsheng.

Chen Changsheng merely waved his whip, effortlessly deflecting Luo Tian’s attack.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow. He had unleashed his spear technique, yet Chen Changsheng’s exhaustion seemed far less.

“Four ounces deflecting a thousand catties?” Luo Tian, having trained in the Five Elements Sect, had heard of this Daoist principle. Yet he had never witnessed it before. Now seeing Chen Changsheng employ it, curiosity stirred within him. He cautiously unleashed the Five Elements’ Life-Generating Seal.

Upon seeing the seal, Chen Changsheng’s face darkened. His whip spun faster, deflecting the seal toward a wall.

Boom! The seal struck the wall with a thunderous roar.

But Luo Tian had no time to ponder how deep the seal had embedded itself. Nor did he have time to strategize against Chen Changsheng’s four ounces deflecting a thousand catties. For the whip, imbued with water element’s gentleness yet concealing a tearing force, swept toward him.

“Pang…” Luo Tian’s fists—radiating five colors—struck the whip. Yet the whip, imbued with sentience, coiled around his arm like a serpent, pushing him into the wall. Luo Tian spat blood again, colliding with the walls as if embedded within them.

“Surrender! You are no match for me. Surrender your treasures, and I may spare your life!” Chen Changsheng’s eyes held no mercy.

“Is that all you have? Let me surrender!” Luo Tian wiped the blood from his lips, murmuring.

“Five Elements’ Life-Generating Seal!” Luo Tian’s hands凝聚 a massive seal, hurling it at Chen Changsheng.

Chen Changsheng’s lips curled. “I told you—it’s useless!” He deflected the seal again with his whip.

Yet soon after, he sensed a gust of wind ahead. Chen Changsheng cursed inwardly and swiftly defended his chest with the whip.

“Pang…” Chen Changsheng was sent flying backward, mirroring Luo Tian’s fate.

“Is this the technique you used to kill Wang Siyuan? Impressive!” Chen Changsheng coughed up blood, speaking with a calm facade.

Yet within his heart, he was stunned. Luo Tian’s Soul-Stealing Seal at the peak of Cultivation Body had inflicted massive damage. Though he had deflected part of it, the attack still wounded his internal organs. Had the whip not blocked it, he might have been unable to stand.

“Three elements’ mutual destruction… light…”

“Rending Sky Spear, Five Elements’ Life-Generating… Golden Serpent’s Wild Dance!” Luo Tian, without waiting for Chen Changsheng to react, unleashed all his attacks.

A blinding light illuminated the cave, even engulfing Chen Changsheng’s form. A dragon-like golden serpent lunged forward, biting hungrily.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed again, cracking many parts of the walls’ Spirit Pulse.

Chapter 152: Unity of Heaven and Humanity

Chen Changsheng collapsed to the ground, his robes torn into mere shreds. His body was riddled with wounds.

“Huff… is it over?” Luo Tian observed Chen Changsheng’s battered form with a solemn gaze. His own energy was barely one in ten, and the relentless battle had left him exhausted. The dozens of refined energy droplets he had cultivated were now reduced to mere two or three.

Panting, Luo Tian gazed at the prone Chen Changsheng. He sighed in admiration of Chen Changsheng’s tenacity. Fortunately, his repertoire was vast; otherwise, he would have perished here.

Yet as Luo Tian observed Chen Changsheng, he noticed the latter’s head twitching slightly. Then came his fingers—before Luo Tian could react, Chen Changsheng rose as if reborn.

“I fear death. I wish for immortality. Hence, my name is Chen Changsheng—because I fear death. Thus, my life-preserving techniques outnumber my offensive ones!”

Chen Changsheng stood, breathing heavily as he spoke.

“An infuriating opponent!” Luo Tian sighed softly. Chen Changsheng’s resilience was like that of a cockroach—irritating.

He dashed toward Chen Changsheng, not out of desire to use techniques but due to his depleted energy. He feared that if he unleashed a technique and Chen Changsheng survived, he would lack the energy to continue.

Seeing Luo Tian approach, Chen Changsheng’s face flickered with battle intent. His whip had been scattered during the fight, leaving him to duel Luo Tian barehanded.

They exchanged blows without techniques. Luo Tian grew increasingly astonished—Chen Changsheng had mastered the water element’s unceasing nature to perfection, interwoven with wood element’s vitality and the four ounces deflecting a thousand catties method. The combination was unparalleled.

Though Luo Tian could endure for a while, his energy consumption far outpaced Chen Changsheng’s.

“Cannot continue like this—otherwise I’ll be drained to death!” Luo Tian leapt back, his hands forming the Soul-Stealing Seal again. The repeated use of this seal had drained his spirit.

Yet Chen Changsheng clung like a band-aid, offering no chance for Luo Tian to form the seal. Astonishingly, Chen Changsheng remained blindfolded throughout, entering a strange state without uttering a word.

If Ying Hongtu and the others had remained, they would have widened their eyes. This was indeed the sect’s ultimate technique—Daoist Natural Law, Unity of Heaven and Humanity. Few within the Water Source Sect could achieve such a state.

Luo Tian’s expression darkened further. His water droplet energy was now reduced to a single drop. At this rate, he would be drained within an hour.

Finally, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with resolve. A crimson pearl appeared in his hand. Upon its arrival, the cave’s temperature plummeted, and a tangible killing aura surged forth.

Dong Sansi stood at the cave’s entrance. Earlier, Ying Hongtu and the others had exited with grim faces. Dong Sansi dared not inquire about their situation but sensed their anger. Yet his heart eased slightly—two remaining opponents were far stronger than five.

At that moment, an icy killing aura emerged from the cave’s entrance. Dong Sansi shivered and recalled Luo Tian’s state in Feiyun Sect, where he had radiated a tangible aura of slaughter. His heart lifted again.

Luo Tian now held the Killing Pearl, his mind conflicted. The aura within was so dense it nearly overwhelmed him. If he fused with it, he might even perish.

Yet as Luo Tian hesitated, Chen Changsheng was awakened from his state by the cold aura. His eyes snapped open, seeing Luo Tian’s Killing Pearl—his heart quaked.

Luo Tian had made his decision. He would fuse the Killing Pearl; otherwise, there was no path forward. With one hand, he raised the pearl high and slammed it onto his forehead.

“Stop, Luo Tian! You… don’t be reckless!” Chen Changsheng’s urgent voice echoed, halting Luo Tian before the pearl touched his forehead.

Luo Tian felt the violent aura and overwhelming energy within the Killing Pearl. His face remained cold as he asked, “What?”

“You don’t be reckless! We can negotiate. Give me the remaining half of the Spirit Pulse, and we’ll stop fighting. How about it?” Chen Changsheng sensed the cold aura and knew if he fused with it, he would be no match.

If he had remained in the Unity of Heaven and Humanity state, they could have fought. But this damned Killing Aura had awakened him—this state was only achievable once a day.

“Ah?” Luo Tian recalled Chen Changsheng’s earlier words about fearing death. His face showed interest, slightly retracting the Killing Pearl. The cold aura had made him uncomfortable.

“We can make peace! I just want that remaining half of the Spirit Pulse!” Chen Changsheng, seeing Luo Tian retract the Killing Pearl, felt relief. He no longer desired the Great Cauldron or Storage Ring.

To wrest them from such a madman was pure fantasy!

“Only a quarter!”

Luo Tian spoke calmly. He was satisfied with this resolution, as no one wished to fight to the death.

“Three quarters! No less!”

“Three fifths! Not a drop more.”

“Deal!” Luo Tian chuckled softly. Gaining three fifths of the Spirit Pulse satisfied him greatly—this was a coveted item that sects fought over.

Chen Changsheng also felt content. A quarter of the Spirit Pulse was no small prize.

After sealing their pact, they rested. The cave’s energy replenished quickly. They then began excavating.

“Crack…” A sharp sound echoed as the Spirit Pulse snapped in two. Chen Changsheng received his half, while Luo Tian stored the other in his Storage Ring.

Chapter 153: Soul Sacrifice

Chen Changsheng collected the remaining quarter of the Spirit Pulse, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration. He clasped his hands: “Luo Tian, you are the first I have admired. May our next meeting be as friends rather than foes. Perhaps we’ll collaborate in the future!”

Luo Tian, appreciating Chen Changsheng’s gesture, clasped his hands in return. This opponent who had forced him to fight with all his might was someone he felt a mutual respect for. He was a Five Elements Body, yet Chen Changsheng—only with water and wood elements—had pushed him to such a limit. It was better not to be enemies.

“Hope so! As long as you don’t covet my belongings, we’ll get along well!” Luo Tian chuckled.

“Also, I warn you—killing Wang Siyuan, be cautious of Xuanyin Sect’s retaliation. Best stay away from Feiyun Sect for a while. Now, contact your sect to have you escorted out—I’m certain Xuanyin Sect’s people are already waiting outside Dian’an Forest!”

Luo Tian, hearing Wang Siyuan’s words, furrowed his brow. He took out his Dandian Jade Token and imprinted a spiritual seal.

“This is my identity token. If you find any treasures or adventures, feel free to seek me out—I’ll help as much as I can!” Chen Changsheng handed Luo Tian a jade token.

Luo Tian, in turn, gave Chen Changsheng a jade token representing Feiyun Sect’s identity. After exchanging tokens, they exited the cave.

As soon as they stepped out, Luo Tian saw Dong Sansi anxiously standing at the entrance. His heart warmed.

Dong Sansi spotted Luo Tian exiting the cave and exhaled a breath of relief, shouting: “Luo Tian!”

Dong Sansi’s shout drew the attention of those who had already collected energy stones and were chatting idly. Their gazes turned to the cave’s entrance.

Seeing both Luo Tian and Chen Changsheng exit together, their faces showed surprise. Yet due to their formidable strength, none dared speak.

Chen Changsheng had already donned a clean Daoist robe, his face restored to its calm and icy demeanor. He bid farewell to Luo Tian and vanished toward Dian’an Forest’s outskirts, obviously needing to return to his sect quickly to refine the Spirit Pulse.

Luo Tian, satisfied with this mission’s success, smiled at Dong Sansi and the others: “Let’s go!”

Though they knew Luo Tian possessed the Spirit Pulse, none dared approach to seize it.

Others saw no profit in this and gradually moved toward the forest’s edge. Some were satisfied with obtaining many energy stones, while others, like Lan Yichen, lamented—having gained nothing and experiencing an unforgettable ordeal.

At that moment, Luo Tian and the others reached Dian’an Forest’s edge. Yet just then, a authoritative voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears: “Return!”

Luo Tian recognized the voice. It was this very sound that had kept many Bone-Devouring realm masters from entering Dian’an Forest. Upon hearing it, Luo Tian’s heart jolted—but immediately, his figure vanished from the sight of Dong Sansi and the others.

……

Outside Dian’an Forest, most had already exited and reunited with their sects. Everyone was discussing this expedition’s experiences. Luo Tian and Chen Changsheng’s names gradually became the subject of conversation.

Among the crowd, Ying Hongtu and the others had grim faces as they overheard people discussing them. As contemporaries, their humiliation of being repelled by the two was a profound disgrace.

“Hum…”

At that moment, an overwhelming aura descended from the sky. A black-cloaked elder stood high above, gazing down at everyone with a face as dark as rain.

Feeling the sky’s aura, nearly a hundred people froze. Their legs bent involuntarily as if sinking into mud.

“Grandfather!” A Xuanyin Sect elder at the Bone-Devouring peak, upon seeing the black-cloaked elder, displayed shock and immediately knelt.

“Hmph! How dare you call me Grandfather? Your disciple is dead, yet you linger outside, acting like a tiger!” The black-cloaked elder’s face bore anger, as if he wished to slap the Bone-Devouring elder.

“Siyuan is dead?” The Bone-Devouring elder was struck as if by lightning, his face filled with disbelief. Then it turned fierce. His gaze swept toward Ying Hongtu and the others, assuming only they could have killed Wang Siyuan.

Seeing the Bone-Devouring elder’s gaze on Ying Hongtu and the others, the black-cloaked elder’s eyes flashed coldly. He waved his hand, and the three appeared before him in an instant, hovering mid-air.

“Respected Elder, I do know some details about this!” Ying Hongtu spoke with a trembling voice.

“Indeed, I also know some details!” Rong Da and Bai Zhantian spoke in trembling voices.

“Speak!” The black-cloaked elder commanded coldly, but the pressure on them lessened.

“This is how it happened…” Ying Hongtu began. The others supplemented in the middle, their默契 clearly directing Wang Siyuan’s death to Luo Tian and Chen Changsheng.

After the black-cloaked elder heard their account, his face darkened. He glanced at their evasive eyes and let out a cold snort. He waved his hand, summoning the three before him.

“Soul-Stealing!” The black-cloaked elder commanded coldly. His powerful spiritual force instantly invaded their minds.

The black-cloaked elder’s mind now contained fragments of how Wang Siyuan had been killed by Luo Tian.

“Hmph! Daring to deceive me!” The black-cloaked elder snorted. Yet he did not harm them, as their status within his sect was considerable. Killing them would cause endless trouble.

He tossed the three to the ground, coldly scanning Dian’an Forest. He muttered a name: “Luo Tian!”

Those trembling on the ground, hearing Wang Siyuan had been killed by Luo Tian, were stunned. Luo Tian was truly audacious—killing a first-rate sect’s prodigy!

Even more shocking to the crowd was the black-cloaked elder’s cultivation. The hallmark of the Spirit Pulse realm is having wings behind one’s back. Yet this elder had no wings yet could fly—thus, he was beyond the Spirit Pulse realm.

“Soul-Annihilation Realm!” A chilling term echoed among the people.

Chapter 154: Dragon Pool

Luo Tian heard a authoritative voice and felt his body tremble. His eyes closed involuntarily.

When he opened them again, he witnessed a sight unforgettable in his life—a scene so震撼 it was the first time he had seen such an awe-inspiring spectacle.

Countless mountain-sized beasts surrounded him, their eyes—vastly larger than his body—curiously observing him.

One black beast resembled a tiger, familiar to Luo Tian from a vision. The others were unknown to him.

Who could remain calm when surrounded by so many beasts? Luo Tian was no exception.

“What are you all going to do?” Luo Tian trembled, asking. He truly feared them, dreading their sneeze might blow him away.

“Don’t be afraid. We wish to grant you a great boon—a tremendous boon!” The black tiger growled, sending hot breath toward Luo Tian’s face.

“I… don’t want it. Can’t you do something else?” Luo Tian gazed at the black tiger, the only one who could speak.

“What did you say!” Before the black tiger could respond, a black gorilla pounded its chest, revealing sharp teeth.

“Pang…” The black tiger’s mighty paw struck the gorilla’s head, emitting a dull sound and sending Luo Tian sprawling again.

“Master said to be gentle with guests. Have you forgotten?” The black tiger roared.

“Yes! Look at me! You beasts are rude!” A green-scaled dragon snake slithered past Luo Tian, its body radiating coldness.

“Little one, we truly wish to grant you this boon! Trust us!” The dragon snake displayed what he believed was a kind expression.

Luo Tian felt his body covered in goosebumps. Gazing at the massive snake head, he stammered: “Believe… believe!”

“Look! Look! I’m the best!” The dragon snake boasted, flicking its tail and toppling several ancient trees.

“Stop playing. Master ordered us to take him in!” A white beast growled.

Hearing the white beast’s roar, the beasts’ faces darkened. The black tiger struck the ground with his paw, sending Luo Tian high into the air. Luo Tian fell onto the tiger’s back, still dazed.

Without resistance, he lay on the tiger’s back, feeling comfortable. Time passed, and Luo Tian accepted his fate. He lay down on the tiger’s back, closing his eyes.

Time passed, and the black tiger placed Luo Tian on the ground. He opened his eyes to see a middle-aged man in white robes gazing at him kindly, and behind him, a womanly figure also looked with concern.

Luo Tian gazed at the man. Though he took human form, Luo Tian sensed a unique ferocity within him.

The man’s gaze held an aura of self-assurance, though well-hidden. Yet Luo Tian felt a trace of it in his presence.

“Respectful elder, I am Luo Tian. I do not know the reason you summoned me,” Luo Tian respectfully bowed.

“First, introduce yourself. I am Long Jian. This is my wife Bai Yuqin. We have summoned you for a matter requiring your help!” Long Jian smiled kindly, and Bai Yuqin looked at Luo Tian with hope.

Luo Tian realized the earlier authoritative voice came from this seemingly kind middle-aged man. His heart grew heavy.

“What great cultivation do you possess, respected elder? I cannot imagine what could trouble you!” Luo Tian did not immediately agree but asked his question.

“It concerns my child! This may be a good opportunity for you!” Long Jian spoke softly, leading Luo Tian into a cave.

The cave had no dampness but was dry and bright. Soon, Long Jian and his wife led Luo Tian to the cave’s depths—a crimson blood pool appeared before him.

Luo Tian’s face darkened. His internal energy surged uncontrollably, sensing the true dragon essence within.

Unaware of this, he noticed a dragon-shaped mark on his hand slowly emerging.

He did not notice these things. What caught his attention was a sleeping boy high above the blood pool!

“Long Baby!” Luo Tian exclaimed. The boy was none other than Long Baby, the one he had met in a vision. Luo Tian never expected to meet this adorable boy here.

“This is our child. I believe you’ve met him before. We summoned you to help with this!” Long Jian’s face showed tenderness, speaking softly to Luo Tian.

“I will do my best!” Luo Tian replied solemnly. He truly liked this mischievous boy, despite the hardships he had endured in the vision. Luo Tian knew Long Baby’s actions were unintentional, and his nature was innocent.

“Good. We thank you. Rest assured, this process will not harm you! This is our promise to you!” Long Jian smiled upon Luo Tian’s agreement.

“Jump into the Dragon Pool first. This is the first step. The pool was created from our blood and the blood of all beasts above the Beast-Devouring level in Dian’an Forest. It is our most precious treasure, enhancing the body’s strength. Only by strengthening your body can you assist us effectively.”

“Good!” Luo Tian did not hesitate, agreeing. He knew if they wished to kill him, there was no need for such words.

Seeing Luo Tian’s immediate agreement, Long Jian showed approval. He mused: “Decisive—no wonder you’ve achieved so much at such a young age!”

“Rest assured, if you cannot endure it, I will intervene and save you!” Long Jian patted Luo Tian’s shoulder.

Chapter 155: Bathing in Dragon Blood

Hearing Long Jian’s words, Luo Tian did not hesitate. He leapt into the Dragon Pool.

As soon as he entered, a powerful pressure surged toward him. His body felt as if pierced by needles.

After falling into the Forgetfulness Pool in Tianyuan City, Luo Tian had endured continuous pain. Yet this Dragon Pool’s torment was far greater than the Forgetfulness Pool.

The single drop of true dragon essence from Tianyuan City had nearly killed him. Now, this pool was filled with dragon blood—far more potent than that single drop of true dragon essence. Though Luo Tian had reached the peak of Cultivation Body, he could not withstand this concentrated dragon essence.

“Good thing it’s not making me drink. I’d rather die!” Luo Tian thought before beginning to circulate his energy, resisting the Dragon Pool’s pressure.

At that moment, Luo Tian looked like a bloodied man. The dragon blood continuously washed over him. Bathing in dragon blood was a blessing many desired—Luo Tian never expected to be chosen, knowing it would be his greatest opportunity in Dian’an Forest. He dared not slacken, vowing to endure as long as possible.

“Not sure how many days this child can last!” Long Jian’s face showed both anticipation and concern, sitting cross-legged beside the pool.

Meanwhile, Bai Yuqin and other beasts sat in meditation outside the cave, guarding Luo Tian and Long Jian. Bai Yuqin’s heart was filled with prayers: “Please succeed!”

……

While Luo Tian bathed in the Dragon Pool, Dong Sansi and others had become ants on a hot pan. They hadn’t exited Dian’an Forest but searched for Luo Tian’s whereabouts.

Meanwhile, the black-cloaked elder of Xuanyin Sect performed a soul-stealing on Bai Zhantian and Rong Da. The results were the same as from Ying Hongtu—his face darkened: “Luo Tian, no matter your status in Feiyun Sect, you must die for killing my grandson!”

After speaking, the black-cloaked elder gazed at Dian’an Forest with a cold face. From their memories, he naturally discovered the rule preventing Beast-Devouring level masters from entering Dian’an Forest.

“Friends of Dian’an Forest, I am Xuanyin Sect’s Wang Tianxing. Please grant me a favor and allow me to enter Dian’an Forest to capture the killer of my grandson!” The black-cloaked elder’s voice echoed across Dian’an Forest.

Long Jian, meditating, heard Wang Tianxing’s words. His face flickered with annoyance and let out a cold snort: “I said, Beast-Devouring level masters—enter and die!”

Wang Tianxing’s face darkened. He laughed coldly, confident in his strength. He believed no one or beast in the Northern Expanse could deter him. His initial call was out of principle—avoiding unnecessary conflict.

Seeing the opponent’s strength, Wang Tianxing—who had always been dominant—could not accept it. His face darkened: “Then I must apologize!”

Wang Tianxing’s words ended, and with a step, he appeared 100 miles away in Dian’an Forest’s sky. His powerful spiritual force spread, searching for Luo Tian. The pressure sent the forest beasts into trembling.

“Die!” Long Jian’s face flashed with coldness. At this critical moment, no unnecessary mistakes were allowed.

Long Jian’s word “Die” echoed. A golden hand shot from his side, silent and swift.

At that moment, Wang Tianxing had just released his spiritual force. He heard the word “Die” and felt his body paralyzed, as if gripped in a hand. The pressure from it made him unable to resist.

For hundreds of years, Wang Tianxing had never felt fear. Now, he did.

“Respected Elder, I was rash. Please allow me one chance!” Wang Tianxing pleaded, his heart filled with fear.

The people outside Dian’an Forest gaped at the sky. The once confident Wang Tianxing now begged for mercy.

“Did I hear correctly? A Soul-Annihilation Realm master is begging!” Yu Pengfei of Feiyun Sect could not believe his eyes, trembling as he spoke.

A Soul-Annihilation Realm master—far stronger than the Spirit Pulse realm. This man now begged before Dian’an Forest’s person.

How strong was this person? The escaped Beast-Devouring masters felt relieved, glad they hadn’t dared to re-enter Dian’an Forest.

“Dian’an Forest is indeed a place of great danger. But this elder alone makes it impossible for anyone to enter freely!” People marveled.

At that moment, the Xuanyin Sect’s Beast-Devouring level elder had cold sweat. If Wang Tianxing perished here, it would be a devastating blow to Xuanyin Sect.

This was a Soul-Annihilation Realm master—valuable within first-rate sects. Wang Siyuan’s death was not a problem, but if Wang Tianxing died, the enraged Xuanyin Sect elders would surely make him pay.

Thinking this, the elder’s cold sweat flowed. His heart prayed silently.

“Hmph! I warned you once already. You ignored my words. My son’s rebirth needs a Soul-Annihilation Realm master’s blood. You’ve brought it to me—how could I refuse? Haha!”

Under the people’s trembling gazes, the golden hand squeezed. Wang Tianxing’s body turned into a mist of blood, scattered in the air.

The golden hand then waved again. The blood mist gathered and vanished from sight.
