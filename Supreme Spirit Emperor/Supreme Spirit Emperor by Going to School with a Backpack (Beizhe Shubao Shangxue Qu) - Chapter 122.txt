Luo Tian swallowed his saliva, his face carrying a look of tension. It was not fear of his identity being exposed, but rather an instinctive nervousness.

"Forgotten..." Luo Tian's heart ached as he spoke, not because he did not wish to conceal it, but because Zhang Daotian's memories truly contained no martial arts techniques.

"Master, you really are a scoundrel!" Luo Tian lamented inwardly, but at this moment, he could only steel his resolve and press forward.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Sichu Chen's face deepened with disappointment. His aged features bore a hint of exhaustion, but to avoid hurting Zhang Daotian's feelings, he forced a gentle expression.

"Daotian, you're not doing well. At least try to make an effort!" Sichu Chen spoke, radiating boundless authority. He clenched his fist and launched a punch.

As Sichu Chen's punch struck, Luo Tian's face trembled with intense shock. He had not expected such an opportunity to arrive so swiftly.

From the moment Sichu Chen's punch began, Luo Tian felt as if he were immersed in the river of time, recalling the sensation of his mother awakening the cycle of reincarnation and himself standing within that passage.

Luo Tian was certain that if he were struck by this punch, his physical body would suffer no harm. However, his soul would definitely be expelled and sent into the reincarnation passage.

"This punch is Reincarnation!" Sichu Chen's eyes gleamed as he gazed at Luo Tian, then extended a finger. The previous image was transmitted into Luo Tian's mind.

Chapter 597: Reincarnation Fist

"Although I can protect you for a thousand years, ten thousand years, even a hundred thousand years, I cannot guard your entire life. Hurry up and grow strong! This punch you must decipher. Also, the art of elixirs is your future foundation for cultivation. Go!" Sichu Chen's face bore a touch of exhaustion as he waved his hand.

Feeling an added sense of沧桑 (sorrow), Luo Tian's heart trembled. He bowed respectfully, his eyes filled with contemplation as he stepped out of the cave.

"Master!" He turned to look at Sichu Chen, only to notice that the latter's figure had slightly bent. Luo Tian did not know what had happened to Sichu Chen, but in this moment, his heart was stirred.

"I'm fine. Go!" Sichu Chen smiled and waved again.

Seeing Sichu Chen's smile, Luo Tian felt an inexplicable bitterness. He turned and exited the cave, gazing at the blue sky and white clouds beyond.

"Master, are you sending me to complete your regrets?" Luo Tian murmured softly, his eyes flashing a cold glint.

This coldness was not directed at Master Zhang Daotian or Sichu Chen, but rather at the Western disciples who had entered the Tian Dao Sect and those from the Southern Region who bore grudges against him.

"In this Xian Gu continent, competition is inevitable. I must crush all those who challenge me at the cradle. Let's start with this Tian Dao Sect!" Luo Tian's face curled into a smile as he strode toward the square.

On the square of the Tian Dao Sect, several spoiled disciples stood anxiously, while three others lay sprawled on the ground with bruised faces.

"What do you think Master Sichu will do to Daotian?"
"Discipline? Has Master Sichu ever disciplined Daotian before? I bet he'll come out unscathed!" One disciple smiled.
"This time is different, though. It was the Tian Dao Thunder Sword! Daotian made such a bold claim. If I were Master Sichu, I'd be furious! I bet he won't leave Master Sichu's cave for at least half a year!" The young men showed no concern for Luo Tian's safety, as Master Sichu's indulgence of Zhang Daotian was well-known within the Tian Dao Sect.

As they discussed, Luo Tian's figure appeared on the square. Hearing their conversation, his lips twitched involuntarily. He sighed inwardly; his master had indeed been quite the spoiled youth in his younger days.

"Daotian, you're here!" Seeing Zhang Daotian's arrival, the young men greeted him.

"I said he'd come out unscathed!" The first disciple, who had claimed Luo Tian would be fine, grinned at the others.

"Ah, what's with these three?" Luo Tian asked.
"They mocked you earlier. What should we do? Break their legs or strip them of cultivation and expel them from the sect?" One disciple shrugged.

"Let them go. These small fry aren't worth it. Let's visit each peak one by one. There was a direct disciple who offended me before; he escaped. Let's find him!" Luo Tian's face darkened as he addressed the young men.

"Who gave him the courage!" The young men, not afraid of confrontation, saw a direct disciple as nothing.

"Summon them!"
"Kill him!" The young men's faces lit up with excitement. One summoned a phoenix made of fire-elemental energy into the sky.
The others tapped their talismans, transmitting their consciousness through them.

At the same time, all disciples of the Tian Dao Sect saw the crimson phoenix in the sky and wore expressions of fear. They knew this phoenix was a signal for the spoiled disciples to gather; once it appeared, someone would surely suffer.

"Whoosh..." The sound of breaking air echoed as young figures descended from the sky, landing before Luo Tian and his group.

"Daotian Senior!"
"Senior Daotian, I heard someone offended you. He truly has no eyes to dare provoke you!" The disciples' faces showed eagerness as they greeted Luo Tian and the young men behind him.

These youths were all from deep-rooted backgrounds within the Tian Dao Sect, with even the current sect master's offspring among them.

Sichu Chen stood outside the cave, gazing at the crimson phoenix in the sky and sighed softly. His eyes again bore disappointment.

"Excellent!" Seeing the people arriving, Luo Tian nodded inwardly. He knew these were his assets to dominate the Tian Dao Sect and find those Western disciples and enemies.

"What expression would others have upon seeing me?" Luo Tian roared, his aura surging as he flew toward the other sect's peaks.

Flying swiftly, the Tian Dao Sect was divided into nine sects. Besides the Elixir Sect, there were also the Forging Sect, the Talisman Sect, and several other sects with different elements.

Luo Tian's group arrived at the first peak, and immediately after their arrival, spoiled disciples emerged, summoning all direct disciples of the subsect. They did not care if the disciples wished to appear; facing Luo Tian's group, they had no choice but to show up.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, scanning the over a thousand people with his spiritual sense, his face showing confusion.

Luo Tian found no one recognized him among these people, leaving him deeply puzzled.

"Xian Gu Dao Ling!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered as he noticed a disciple wearing a secondary Xian Gu Dao Ling on his waist. He flashed to the disciple's side.

"Do you know me?" Luo Tian's eyes glowed like lightning, locking onto the disciple's gaze. If the disciple lied, Luo Tian would sense it immediately.

"Know you? You're not the little master!" The disciple, seeing Luo Tian approaching, nearly wet his pants. He smiled fawningly and spoke quickly, but inwardly he was thinking: I've never offended this little master. Why has he come after me?

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's mind puzzled. This disciple bore a secondary Xian Gu Dao Ling, so he definitely wasn't from this sect. He must be like Luo Tian himself—a disciple from the Tianyuan Continent, but why was there no trace of the Tianyuan Continent's aura?

"Could it be that not everyone awakens, but instead fully integrates into the identity of a Tian Dao Sect disciple?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with sharpness, his face lighting up with joy.

"If that's the case, it's even more beneficial for me!" Luo Tian laughed and soared into the sky again, waving to his group as he flew toward the next peak.

Chapter 598: Zheng Xin?

Luo Tian's group flew swiftly and arrived at the second peak, a gathering place for fire-element disciples. Soon after, over two thousand direct disciples appeared on the square under the spoiled disciples' organization, their faces filled with panic as they gazed at Luo Tian's group.

"No one!" Luo Tian's eyes showed deep confusion. This peak had no familiar faces, only a few disciples with secondary Xian Gu Dao Lings, just like the previous one. They had also integrated into the identity of Tian Dao Sect disciples without any signs of awakening.

Luo Tian's group of over two hundred marched boldly into the next peak, the Wind-element disciples' territory.

Wind-element disciples were fewer in number compared to other peaks, only a few hundred, as wind was a rare element compared to the five elements.

Luo Tian stood in the sky, his powerful spiritual sense scanning the hundreds of people. Though he found some with Xian Gu Dao Lings, there was no particular sign.

However, his gaze fell on a young disciple's figure, and he smiled slightly.

"Daotian, is it him?" Seeing Daotian heading toward the young disciple, Luo Tian's group showed anger. Two hundred people glared at the disciple with fierce eyes.

"Damn... when did I offend this little master? I don't even know!" The young disciple inwardly cursed, his face showing恭敬 (reverence) as he looked at Luo Tian, forcing a fawning smile and waiting for Luo Tian's next move.

"What's your name?" Luo Tian felt joy and asked the disciple.

"Little master, I'm Zheng Junfeng. Little master, please have mercy! I've never offended you before. I'm a good person. I've always respected you, even when it comes to the dog you keep, I would avoid it. I..." Zheng Junfeng spoke continuously about his admiration for Luo Tian.

"Damn..." Luo Tian slapped his forehead, his face showing helplessness. After Zheng Junfeng's words, his suspicions were even more confirmed.

"Zheng Xin! This is definitely Zheng Xin! His speech rate is unmistakable!" Luo Tian's face lit up with joy. He hadn't expected to meet Zheng Xin here, and it seemed Zheng Xin also showed no signs of awakening.

But Luo Tian's joy was harmless, and to Zheng Junfeng it appeared as a demon-like smile. Zheng Junfeng immediately fell to his knees, shouting: "Little master, I've truly never offended you. I can swear before heaven... I..."

Zheng Junfeng was completely panicked. Zhang Daotian's actions were well-known throughout the Tian Dao Sect. Though he was a direct disciple of a senior, in the eyes of this group, he was nothing more than a fart. Even his own master had no significance in their eyes.

Back then, one direct disciple had offended Luo Tian and was beaten to death by this group of bullies. Though people knew it was Zhang Daotian's group who did it, no one dared to object. It could be said that Zhang Daotian's group had the power to make people disappear silently within the Tian Dao Sect, even if they couldn't kill openly.

"Damn..." Luo Tian saw Zheng Junfeng kneeling on the ground, his lips twitching. He lifted Zheng Junfeng and wore a strange expression, sighing inwardly; this was a big problem. If this kid recovered, he'd definitely seek revenge.

"Stop talking! Shut up!" Luo Tian shouted, silencing Zheng Junfeng's begging.

"Do you know him?" Luo Tian snapped his fingers, revealing a portrait of his true self before Zheng Junfeng and the others.

Seeing Luo Tian's portrait, Zheng Junfeng showed confusion. After thinking for a moment, he spoke softly: "Little master, this person gives me a familiar feeling, but I truly don't know him. This bastard offended you, so please rest assured, I'll go to great lengths to find this kid and bring him before you!" Zheng Junfeng assured Luo Tian, patting his chest.

"Damn it! You're the bastard! Your whole family is bastards!" Luo Tian kicked Zheng Junfeng away and cursed.

"From now on, you'll follow me. Your eloquence is remarkable!" Luo Tian smiled, naturally not allowing Zheng Xin to stay here any longer.

"What?" Zheng Junfeng's face showed disbelief, his eyes on Luo Tian as he asked instinctively.

"Kid, Daotian is taking you as a servant. This is your fortune from eight lifetimes of cultivation! Why aren't you kneeling to thank him?" Luo Tian's companions laughed and shouted at Zheng Junfeng.

The people watching the scene wore expressions of envy and admiration, looking at Zheng Junfeng. They hadn't expected that within a short time, Zheng Junfeng had not only avoided trouble but found a great patron.

The disciples of the Tian Dao Sect knew that although Zhang Daotian was arrogant and domineering to outsiders, he was extremely kind to his own. Even the dog Zhang Daotian kept would be avenged if anyone harmed it. This was the only virtue of Zhang Daotian.

Although most disciples of the Tian Dao Sect hated Zhang Daotian, they preferred to be taken under his protection.

Zheng Junfeng was stunned, thinking Zhang Daotian had just kicked him away and he was doomed. But he hadn't expected Zhang Daotian to change so quickly, leaving him stunned.

"Come on, don't stay here!" Luo Tian approached Zheng Junfeng and woke him from his trance.

"Thank you, little master! Little master, rest assured, from today on, whenever I'm told to go west, I won't go east. You tell me to do something, and I'll definitely be your servant, clearing all obstacles for you... I'll go through fire and water for you..." Zheng Junfeng smiled fawningly, standing before Luo Tian and constantly praising him.

"Stop! I don't have any demands of you. Just don't speak and follow me silently!" Luo Tian sighed, rubbing his forehead in exhaustion.

"Yes!" Zheng Junfeng didn't dare to delay and quickly closed his mouth, standing respectfully with reverence as if a servant.

Seeing Zheng Junfeng so obedient, Luo Tian sighed inwardly and suddenly soared into the air with his group, arrogantly heading toward the next peak.

"What a lucky fellow! I didn't expect Zhang Daotian, the little master, to like such people!" The disciples murmured as they watched Zhang Daotian's group leave.

Chapter 599: Finally Found You

One peak, two peaks—Luo Tian's group searched one after another. Under the fearful gazes of disciples from each sect, they disappeared repeatedly.

"Seventh peak!" Luo Tian murmured inwardly, gazing at the Talisman Sect's mountain.

The current peak was the seventh they had searched. Though they found some with secondary Xian Gu Dao Lings in previous peaks, Luo Tian hadn't found his enemies. At most, he had discovered a young disciple ranked thirteenth among the Southern Region's elites, who had previously provoked Luo Tian at the Xian Gu Gate.

Luo Tian didn't rush to confront that disciple, fearing any mistake. His main goal was to find the mysterious Western disciples—those ten or so who had made him uneasy.

The Talisman Sect's disciples were few, as talismans were external forces and not common. Hundreds of people quickly emerged under the spoiled disciples' call, reluctantly stepping out.

His spiritual sense scanned and immediately furrowed his brows, focusing on a seemingly ordinary young man.

Though the man's appearance was unremarkable, Luo Tian sensed an icy chill in his soul. Seeing him, Luo Tian felt a strong urge to kill and a sense of danger.

"You come out!" Luo Tian stood in the sky, pointing at the ordinary young man.

"Little master, I..." The man, seeing Luo Tian point at him, showed fear and didn't dare to delay. He slowly stepped out of the crowd.

"No mistake, I've finally found you!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with hatred. He raised his hand slightly, and a powerful suction force emanated from it, directly affecting the man's soul.

"Daotian, is it him?"
"Kid, you're really desperate! Daring to offend Daotian! You should kneel and beg for your legs broken!" Luo Tian's companions shouted angrily.

The man hadn't awakened yet, his face instinctively showing fear as he pondered where he had offended this little master. At that moment, Luo Tian's suction force was already affecting his soul.

"Ah..." A pitiful scream came from the man's mouth, and a black soul slowly appeared in people's sight.

"Signs of awakening!" Luo Tian saw the black soul struggling and the young man's face showing confusion. He was about to extract the young man's soul, gradually questioning whether Lu Kunpeng's venom in his body was related to them. His eyes flashed with hatred.

"This person is the one who deceived me and Ma Xiujie in the bet! If it weren't for him, the Tian Dao Thunder Sword wouldn't have been lost. Today, I'll kill him!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly and he appeared before the young man in a flash, launching a "Mortifying Life" punch.

Luo Tian's punch fell, and the young man, who had been confused, now showed pain. His life force slowly faded.

"Daotian, don't!" The young men accompanying Luo Tian saw him truly wanting to kill the disciple. Their previous indifferent expressions changed.

Killing a direct disciple was something they had done before, but never openly.

"Daotian, there are many ways to kill him. Leave it to us; within seven days, we'll make him disappear completely!" Several disciples of the elders and their offspring approached Luo Tian and whispered.

"I can't wait any longer; he'll awaken soon!" Luo Tian saw the young man's soul gradually becoming clear and sighed inwardly, his face showing hatred.

"I can't wait that long; I want him dead!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, his fist emitting powerful waves. A沧桑 (ancient) aura spread from his fist.

"This!" The young men saw the waves gathering on Luo Tian's fist and showed joy.

"Good, you made a mistake, and killing a direct disciple is a crime you can't bear. We'll kill him together with you!" The young men showed hatred and quickly changed their hands.

The two hundred people in the sky wore expressions of bitterness but didn't dare to act. Even the sect master's offspring didn't move, knowing only these nine could bear the consequences of killing a direct disciple. Even the sect master's offspring couldn't.

The disciples of the Talisman Sect showed shock, not expecting these people to have become so lawless as to kill a direct disciple openly.

The young man was restrained by Luo Tian's soul control, his body on the verge of awakening. He was momentarily stunned, showing a painful expression.

"Buzz..." A powerful wave rose from Luo Tian's fist, making people tremble and showing confusion. They felt Zhang Daotian's punch's immense power.

"Reincarnation!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with hatred and he launched a punch, as if opening the reincarnation passage. A powerful suction force from Luo Tian's punch absorbed the young man's soul.

"Boom..." In an instant, the other eight people's martial arts fell onto the young man's body, submerging it completely.

"Dead..." Zheng Junfeng showed fear toward Luo Tian, inwardly relieved that it wasn't him. He also resolved to flatter Zhang Daotian from now on.

"Daotian, that punch you just used!"
"Is it Reincarnation?" The eight young men who assisted Luo Tian in killing the disciple showed disbelief.

Reincarnation Fist—others didn't know, but they did. It was Dan Zǔ's (Dan Ancestor) secret technique. Dan Zǔ had always wanted Zhang Daotian to learn it, but Zhang Daotian seemed to lack talent. After nearly seven or eight years of study, he had never learned it.

Sichu Chen sat in his cave and suddenly opened his eyes. As Sichu Chen's eyes opened, the entire cave brightened.

"Haha!" Sichu Chen laughed heartily, shaking the Dan Sect's mountain three times. He was overjoyed, not expecting Zhang Daotian to have learned Reincarnation Fist, even if the power was slightly weaker. However, with increased cultivation and practice, Sichu Chen was certain Zhang Daotian could fully master this punch.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded, looking at the eight men before him with gratitude. His heart was inexplicably touched.

Luo Tian knew these people were considered spoiled disciples by others, merely drinking and eating friends. However, they all knew their friendship had become brothers in life and death.

"Boom..." The sky again echoed with a thunderous sound, making the group's eyes slightly tense.

Chapter 600: Punishment

"Boom..." The void split open, and a burly man appeared above the crowd, making people instinctively tremble.

"Respect the Sect Master!" Seeing the burly man's appearance, people showed a touch of reverence and bowed to the middle-aged man in the sky.

The middle-aged man waved his hand, and chains flew from the void, instantly binding Luo Tian and the eight who had joined him. Their cultivation was sealed.

"Zhang Daotian, Ren Hongzhi, Le Shengjie... nine people, harming fellow disciples. According to the sect rules, they should be executed. However, considering your ancestors' contributions to the Tian Dao Sect, their death penalty is waived. But, they must endure punishment!" The middle-aged man's face showed authority, releasing his cultivation of the Soul Consolidation Phase. Luo Tian and the others felt shortness of breath.

Yet, their faces showed no regret, eyes filled with arrogance as they gazed at the sky.

"Punishment: five thunder punishments! Zhang Daotian, as the main culprit, will endure ten thunder strikes. Whether they live or die is up to fate!" The middle-aged man coldly spoke.

"Damn, five! How much do they hate me!" Ren Hongzhi and others cursed.

Thunder punishment was a method of punishing disciples in the Tian Dao Sect. Historically, no disciple had ever endured more than five thunder strikes. Now, Luo Tian and his group had created a first in the history of the Tian Dao Sect.

"Daotian, we don't have much connection with them. They won't kill us, but those old men have long disliked you. Be careful; this time, why didn't Dan Zǔ appear? I remember every time you made a mistake, Dan Zǔ would appear immediately. Why is it different today?" Ren Hongzhi and others spoke, their eyes filled with concern.

"First strike!" The middle-aged man said, and without waiting for Luo Tian's group to react, nine thunder strikes fell upon their heads.

One thunder strike struck Luo Tian and Ren Hongzhi, causing them to spit blood and pale faces.

"Damn it! Old bastards, you're playing for real!" Ren Hongzhi cursed loudly. His voice spread throughout the Tian Dao Sect, reaching the ears of the elders on each peak.

"This little bastard!" Ren Hongzhi's grandfather, who controlled the Fire Sect, heard Ren Hongzhi's curse and muttered a scolding. However, he began to send messages to the Tian Dao Sect Master in the sky.

"Second strike!" The middle-aged man seemed not to have heard, sneering and sending another thunder strike.

But Luo Tian's group knew the power of the lightning was slightly weaker, yet it still struck them with cries and wails.

"Third strike... Fourth strike... Fifth strike..." Thunder strikes fell one after another, their momentum growing stronger each time. The power was slightly weaker but within the group's endurance.

Ren Hongzhi and others turned pale, their bodies in disarray. They laughed wildly.

"Brothers, we'll retreat first. Take care!" Ren Hongzhi and others weakly spoke, being teleported to a safe place by the Tian Dao Sect Master.

"I'm alone now!" Luo Tian's eyes showed stubbornness. He knew if he apologized, the thunder punishment wouldn't kill him. The elders would give Sichu Chen some face. However, Luo Tian didn't want to let Sichu Chen owe others a favor because he was Luo Tian, no longer the young Zhang Daotian.

Luo Tian knew Zhang Daotian's purpose was to complete his past regrets, making Sichu Chen proud of having him as a disciple.

At this moment, nine elders stood on the peak of the Dan Sect, their faces cold as they watched Luo Tian on the square.

"Sichu, this boy is too unruly; he must be severely punished. Now that he's young, he has already caused so much trouble for the Tian Dao Sect and committed a major disaster. What if, on our day of return to the void, this boy brings disaster to the Tian Dao Sect?" One elder spoke, his eyes filled with a sigh.

"This boy's nature is hard to change; he's arrogant and domineering. Disciples killed by him number at least ten. Now, he dares to openly kill a direct disciple. I think he should be killed to eliminate future problems!" The elder of the Forging Sect spoke, his voice like a sharp sword cutting through the void.

"You dare!" Sichu Chen's eyes flashed like lightning, gazing at the elder. A torrent of power radiated from him. If the elder continued speaking, Sichu Chen would definitely turn against him.

"Today I say this: whatever punishment you choose is fine! But if you kill my disciple, don't blame me for turning against you. I have only one disciple in my life. Who dares to harm him, I'll harm them. After all, my lifespan is short and I have nothing left to lose!" Sichu Chen's cold gaze swept over the elders.

"Sixth strike!" As Sichu Chen's words ended, the Tian Dao Sect Master had already sent the sixth thunder strike.

"Come on! I'm not afraid of heavenly punishment, let alone these small thunder strikes!" Luo Tian roared inwardly, his face filled with battle spirit. His hands emitted a faint wave, and he launched a "Mortifying Life" punch against the descending thunder strike.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming, and Luo Tian appeared as if bathed in lightning, his body radiating supreme authority.

"How come this boy seems like a different person?" The eight elders' offspring showed strange expressions, gazing at Luo Tian standing in the sky who resisted the thunder punishment.

"Wood-element's truth?" Sichu Chen saw Luo Tian's "Mortifying Life" punch and his face slightly changed, his eyes filled with excitement. For years, Sichu Chen had never felt so happy as today.

"Boom..." Although Luo Tian's "Mortifying Life" punch was powerful, it still couldn't withstand the power of the thunder strike conjured by the Tian Dao Sect Master at the Soul Consolidation Phase. Luo Tian fell to the ground in a messy state.

"Again!" Luo Tian stood up, returning to the scene of his past thunder trials. His eyes showed strong determination.

Now, Luo Tian could use few techniques, but it wasn't entirely without them. Though explaining was complicated, he didn't care at this moment.

"Kai Tian!" Luo Tian moved his hands slightly, and the already dark sky became even darker. A golden "Kai Tian" seal emerged from a crack, radiating overwhelming pressure and transforming into a golden meteor. It flew toward the descending golden lightning.

"Crack..." The thunderous sound spread, and the golden lightning dispersed under the "Kai Tian" seal's influence without harming Luo Tian.

"I damn it, when did Daotian become so strong? What martial art is this? I feel its power surpasses that of a high-level grade!" The eight elders' offspring stared in awe, watching Luo Tian standing there with long hair飞扬 (flying).

Chapter 601: Rise and Conquer

Seeing Luo Tian standing there unharmed, his face filled with arrogance and confidence, people were stunned. This was not the Zhang Daotian they remembered.

"I still have three left. I want to refine my body with thunder punishment, making it stronger!" Luo Tian murmured softly, his eyes filled with determination. He had already understood the truth of the thunder element, but this body of Zhang Daotian lacked thunder. He had a considerable chance to refine his body with thunder punishment.

Sichu Chen's gaze held surprise as he watched Luo Tian. Zhang Daotian had given him such a big surprise today. Although he didn't know how Zhang Daotian obtained his martial arts or understood the truth of the wood element, Sichu Chen didn't care. What mattered was Zhang Daotian; today's surprises had completely lifted his inner frustration, and his aged face even showed a touch of vitality.

"Sichu, I didn't expect your disciple to have changed so much," the other eight elders frowned slightly.

"Boom..." The thunder roared again in the sky, drawing people's attention to Zhang Daotian standing there.

"Master Sect Leader, please increase the power of the thunder punishment!" Luo Tian smiled and gazed at the Tian Dao Sect Master in the sky.

"Arrogant!" The disciples of the Talisman Sect's mouths twitched, and Zhang Daotian's words had completely shifted their slightly changed image of him back to its original state.

"The one who said Zhang Daotian had changed," the elder muttered, patting his forehead and wishing to hit himself.

Sichu Chen, however, seemed not to have heard, his eyes shining as he watched Zhang Daotian standing there. Although Zhang Daotian's words were arrogant, the fact that he had understood Reincarnation Fist and the truth of the wood element was enough for Sichu Chen. In his heart, these two things were sufficient to offset any mistakes Zhang Daotian had made today.

"Eighth strike!" The Tian Dao Sect Master, seemingly deaf, spoke in a low voice.

"Here it comes!" Luo Tian laughed and showed no fear, gazing at the lightning dragon approaching him.

No spiritual energy surged; Luo Tian simply smiled and let the thunder punishment strike his body.

"Damn it!" The Sect Master saw Luo Tian's actions and showed a touch of surprise. Though he had seemed calm, he had slightly increased the thunder punishment's power. If Luo Tian didn't resist, he wouldn't have been able to withstand the thunder punishment's invasion.

"Crack..." Luo Tian's body instantly became charred black, and he fell to the ground.

"This..." The disciples saw Luo Tian's state and showed tension, while the eight elders' offspring and two hundred background-rich disciples showed anxious expressions. They gazed at the sky, hoping elders would intervene and stop the Tian Dao Sect Master.

Even the Tian Dao Sect Master was subconsciously trembling, gazing at the Dan Sect's direction. Though he knew that with Dan Zǔ present, Zhang Daotian would definitely not die, it was still risky to anger Dan Zǔ.

"Sichu, won't you intervene?" The other elders showed confusion, gazing at Sichu Chen. Usually, when such situations arose, Sichu Chen would have already rescued Zhang Daotian. However, today's Sichu Chen, though showing a touch of tension, stood there without any intention to act.

"This is his choice; I never stop him from making it!" Sichu Chen, for the first time, showed a look of approval as he gazed at Zhang Daotian. Today's Zhang Daotian had given Sichu Chen too many surprises, even making him think he was dreaming.

"It's not enough! Again!" A low voice rose, and the charred Luo Tian slowly stood up. His entire body had no good place, but his eyes glowed with endless light.

"It's not enough! I need more refinement!" Luo Tian felt that after this thunder punishment, his physical body was constantly strengthening. However, it still fell short of his previous one.

"Standing up!" People showed surprise, watching Zhang Daotian standing up and being speechless.

"This..." The Tian Dao Sect Master was also stunned, unsure how to proceed and only looking to the Dan Sect's direction for the elders' decisions.

"Continue, increase the power!" Sichu Chen's eyes sparkled as he transmitted to the Tian Dao Sect Master, making him stunned.

"When did Dan Zǔ turn soft?" The Tian Dao Sect Master's mouth twitched. Previously, he would have had no good outcome, but now, the Dan Zǔ who usually indulged Zhang Daotian showed no resistance and even ordered him to increase the thunder punishment's power.
