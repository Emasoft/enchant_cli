“Indeed, the one who wields the Dragon Abyss Sword is no ordinary man. I wonder about his sword artistry!” Ye Qiu stood rooted to the spot, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian’s towering figure.

“Fury of the Barbarian God—Crushing the Nine Heavens!” A massive black foot descended from the sky, shaking the heavens and earth. It crashed down upon Fan Tianyin like a mountain.

“Buzz…” Fan Tianyin’s face twisted into a sneer. A surge of energy rippled from his body, and with a flick of his form, he left behind a ghostly afterimage before vanishing from sight.

“Boom…” The thunderous impact echoed as Luo Tian’s black foot struck the ground, producing a deep, resonant sound.

“Die!” In an instant, Fan Tianyin materialized before Luo Tian’s massive head and launched a punch.

A crackling sound erupted from Fan Tianyin’s fist, and in the blink of an eye, his punch materialized before Luo Tian’s eyes.

“Boom…” Luo Tian reacted swiftly, grabbing Fan Tianyin’s punch with his hand.

Step by step…
The colossal body retreated, colliding with the domain power and sending ripples through the air. Blood trickled from Luo Tian’s lips.

“Earth Demonic Thirty-Six Fists!” Fan Tianyin roared, breaking free from Luo Tian’s grip. His hands moved rapidly, forming intricate seals that manifested upon his arms. In an instant, both arms swelled to monstrous proportions.

Two thick fists transformed into blurs of motion, hurtling toward Luo Tian. The massive punches enveloped his body in a storm of destruction.

The thunderous clashes echoed around Luo Tian, obscuring the battlefield. All could see was the trembling of the domain barrier behind him.

“Yin Spirit Nine Transformations combined with Earth Demonic Thirty-Six Fists—this is the perfect match for the Yin Spirit Sect. However, Fan Tianyin can only unleash thirty-six punches with this technique, not seventy-two or one hundred and eight. But even so, it is enough. Even a True Immortal at the peak would find it difficult to endure such power!” Shu Guiwang’s eyes gleamed with admiration as he observed the battlefield between Fan Tianyin and Luo Tian.

Only Shu Guiwang and three others could witness the battle. Shu Guiwang marveled, for Luo Tian had endured it all despite his battered state. Each punch from Fan Tianyin cracked Luo Tian’s palm, blood spattering as his body repeatedly collided with the domain barrier.

The thunderous echoes continued. Though it had only been a half incense stick of time, for Fan Tianyin, this was his most formidable period.

“Rippling waves…” Fan Tianyin appeared a hundred feet away, his body restored to normal but with a pale face and signs of weakness.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian’s massive divine form shattered, his body sliding down the barrier, blood staining it into a crimson line.

“Do you have any more tricks?” Luo Tian rose slowly, his gaze fixed on Fan Tianyin trembling a hundred feet away.

“Blocked it! How did he do that!” Fan Tianyin’s face darkened, staring at the battered Luo Tian. He had never expected Luo Tian to withstand so many punches.

“Even this?” Others turned their heads, gazing at the breathless Luo Tian standing there.

“It’s my turn now!” Luo Tian chuckled, leaping into the air and charging toward Fan Tianyin.

“Damn it!” Fan Tianyin cursed, seeing Luo Tian’s battered form. A flicker of hope stirred in his heart as he raised his black staff, clashing with the descending Dragon Abyss Sword.

“Crack!” Thunder crackled. This time, Fan Tianyin was forced back.

“This Rotating Sect’s prodigy is truly formidable!” Ye Qiu’s face bore anticipation. The other two sect members in the first group also wore expressions of concern.

The Dragon Abyss Sword, sheathed and wielded, repeatedly struck down. Luo Tian once again forced Fan Tianyin into a corner—though the scene mirrored their earlier clash, the positions had reversed.

Meanwhile, Wang Gang, Mo Tian, and Qiu Long also unleashed their power, overpowering their opponents with brutal intensity.

“Boom!” Finally, Fan Tianyin could not endure and was struck to the ground by Luo Tian’s sword. His eyes closed, unconscious.

Wang Gang, Mo Tian, and Qiu Long also unleashed their might, wounding their opponents beyond further combat.

Chapter 2179: Cheng Ping (Victory Peace)

On the platform, four figures lay battered and bloodied, eyes closed. Mo Tian, Wang Gang, Qiu Long panted heavily as they gazed at the crowd below.

“Rotating Sect wins!” Shu Guiwang announced, his voice echoing through the Rotating Sect.

“What?” The crowd watching the Shura Sect and Five Palaces’ match gasped, turning their eyes toward Luo Tian’s group on the battlefield.

“Is it over? The Rotating Sect actually won!” No one had expected the underdog Rotating Sect to triumph.

“This is a breakthrough for zero! It seems this time, the Rotating Sect won’t be last!” The representatives from other sects bore expressions of surprise as they watched Luo Tian’s group descend from the battlefield.

“Yet this victory was too swift. Has the Yin Spirit Sect become so weak?” The crowd’s eyes flickered with contemplation as they gazed at Fan Tianyin’s group.

The Rotating Sect disciples were overjoyed, cheering loudly. Yet the other sects’ prodigies still looked down on them, considering the Rotating Sect and Yin Spirit Sect as equally weak.

Only Ye Qiu’s gaze bore contemplation, his eyes fixed on Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian stepped off the battlefield, the Dragon Abyss Sword emitted a tremor, causing his brow to furrow slightly.

“Hm?” Sensing it, Luo Tian’s gaze met Ye Qiu’s. They locked eyes before both turned their attention to the two swords behind them.

The two legendary凶剑 (fearsome swords) trembled, as if eager to break free from their sheaths. Yet both were subdued by Luo Tian and Ye Qiu, who exchanged a grin before withdrawing their gazes.

“Dragon Abyss Sword ranks third. Absolute Cloud is fourth. But I suspect Ye Qiu has wielded Absolute Cloud longer!” Luo Tian mused, estimating their strengths.

“Time to rest,” Mo Tian smiled as he returned to the group, sitting cross-legged to recover.

“How are you? Are you hurt?” As Luo Tian returned, Fu Xingxuan acted like a devoted wife, tidying his disheveled attire.

“I’m fine,” Luo Tian was surprised. Fu Xingxuan rarely did this in public, but he dismissed it—after all, they were old married partners.

“Truly defeated!” The group groaned loudly, watching their actions with mixed feelings.

“I don’t want to live anymore!” The Rotating Sect disciples cried, watching the two. Especially Wang Lie stood beside Wang Gang, his eyes filled with envy. He had joined the Rotating Sect for Fu Xingxuan, but he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have won her over just months before him.

“What’s going on?” Wang Gang and the others looked puzzled at Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan. They had been in battle and hadn’t heard Fu Xingxuan’s conversation with Su Dan.

“What? What’s going on? The Holy Maiden has a suitor!” Mo Cheng sighed, addressing Wang Gang and the others.

“…”

“He wasn’t with Su Dan? How…?” Qiu Long’s face bore disbelief, but Luo Tian’s glare silenced him.

“Rest. Prepare for the next match,” Qiu Long chuckled, sitting cross-legged to recover.

“As you rest, I’ve prepared these nine-turn recovery pills. They’ll accelerate your healing,” a senior approached Luo Tian’s group, raising his hand to reveal four black pills before them.

“Thank you, Lord Zun Gui!” The four said in unison. After all, Zun Gui was a mid-stage Immortal King and the referee—also Su Dan’s father.

“No need to thank me. It’s a regulation. You have one match left!” Zun Gui snorted, gazing at Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan before turning away.

“Next match: Equal Sect vs. Fengdu Sect!” Shu Guiwang’s voice announced the Rotating Sect’s next battle.

Luo Tian’s group would now face Huangtian Sect. As the defeated Yin Spirit Sect could rest two matches, they would fight against the loser of Equal Sect and Fengdu Sect.

Regardless, every team must complete four matches. After each match, they would have at least one rest period.

“Watch closely. Both Equal Sect and Fengdu Sect are strong—Equal Sect was first in the last competition, while Fengdu Sect was third!” Fu Xingxuan addressed Luo Tian’s group. After consuming the pills, their cultivation and injuries rapidly recovered. They gazed at the two sects now standing on the platform.

“Ye Qiu, I never accepted my defeat back then!” A youth stood there, gazing at Ye Qiu who carried Absolute Cloud.

“This is Equal Sect’s prodigy, Cheng Ping!”

“Previously, it was rumored they had dueled. But Cheng Ping lost to Ye Qiu—more precisely, under Absolute Cloud!” Wang Gang explained, watching the tense confrontation.

“Hmph. Today I’ll make you accept it!” Ye Qiu chuckled, his voice calm but exuding authority.

“Kill!” Both men roared, charging at each other. Their auras surged like two streaks of light, colliding upon their opponents.

The three behind them also rushed forward, their auras blazing. The clash of power echoed from the platform.

Luo Tian’s group didn’t focus on the other match but observed Equal Sect and Fengdu Sect’s battle, especially Mo Tian, who used his Moon Eclipse Eye to scrutinize the fight and relay information.

“Boom boom boom…” Their palms clashed repeatedly, each impact producing a deep sound.

“Evenly matched!” Mo Tian remarked, watching their relentless exchanges at lightning speed.

“Indeed. Both are strong—this is just the beginning, a warm-up!” Luo Tian smiled, his eyes alight with battle fervor.

On Ye Qiu and Cheng Ping, Luo Tian sensed a threat. Especially Ye Qiu—Luo Tian felt he would need to employ many strategies to defeat him. Among his peers, only Yang Huanyu could challenge him.

“Ye Qiu, draw Absolute Cloud. You can’t defeat me without it!” Cheng Ping retreated, his face cold.

“Not yet,” Ye Qiu smiled, rubbing his hands with cracks that rapidly healed.

“Beware!” Ye Qiu closed his eyes, his aura rising like a sword drawn from its sheath. His eyes snapped open, two streams of sword qi swirling within them. He extended his hand, and an invisible stream of sword qi shot forth, moving with him toward Cheng Ping.

“Finally serious!” Cheng Ping’s face stiffened. His aura surged again, and a phantom spear materialized in his hand. He extended his hand as well.

The spear shot forth, and Cheng Ping seized it, rushing toward Ye Qiu. The clash of sword qi and spear resounded again—each collision shattered multiple spears and sword glows, creating gusts that swept before them.

“This Cheng Ping has a unique understanding of spear art!” Luo Tian mused, gazing at Cheng Ping.

“Ye Qiu’s companions are also formidable!” Wang Gang observed the other battlefield, his eyes filled with surprise as he watched their opponents.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian gazed at the entire battlefield, sighing deeply. Every participant in this grand competition deserved the title of prodigy. Fengdu Sect’s overall strength was indeed far superior to Yin Spirit Sect—not because Fan Tianyin was weak, but because his three companions were not strong.

If those three had defeated Wang Gang’s group and then surrounded Luo Tian, he might not have survived.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian mused, a flash of white light illuminated the sky. The Dragon Abyss Sword on his back erupted with overwhelming battle intent, as if provoked, yearning to break free.

“It’s not yet time!” Luo Tian whispered, subduing the three-inch sword back into place.

The pristine blade and hilt gleamed like a sacred weapon, appearing in Ye Qiu’s hand.

“Finally drawn!” Cheng Ping panted, his face alight with battle fervor. Seeing Absolute Cloud, he showed no fear but excitement.

“Buzz…” Two long dragons materialized in Cheng Ping’s hands, then transformed into twin spears that he gripped.

Two auras clashed like two emperors facing off. The aura from Cheng Ping’s twin spears was no weaker than Absolute Cloud.

“Never again will I make the same mistake. This pair of spears is what I prepared for you!” Cheng Ping’s eyes narrowed with a sneer, his hands moving rapidly. Phantom spear images erupted from his twin spears.

“Ah! That’s the Dragon and Tiger Severing Soul Spear!” Wang Gang murmured, watching Cheng Ping’s twin spears.

“Roar…” As Wang Gang’s words faded, a black tiger and long dragon roared forth, their massive bodies composed entirely of spear qi.

“Indeed, he’s improved. But I haven’t stood still either!” Ye Qiu gazed at the dragon and tiger, a smile flickering in his eyes.

Sword qi surged forth, forming a storm of blades that swept out. Each blade carried an immense aura.

“Boom…” The next moment, the storm of blades descended upon the dragon and tiger, mercilessly tearing them apart.

Chapter 2180: Against Huangtian Sect

Turbulent energy surged between the two, roaring to the heavens. Cheng Ping continuously wielded his twin spears while Ye Qiu danced with Absolute Cloud, their sword qi and spear images constantly replenishing the storm of blades and dragon-tiger forms.

In the chaotic storm, the dragon and tiger seemed trapped, desperately trying to break free but ensnared by the sword qi storm.

“This is a test of cultivation. Though it seems simple, both are maintaining their formations—this must be exhausting!” Luo Tian murmured, watching Ye Qiu and Cheng Ping’s relentless attacks.

“The most direct method—see who collapses first!” The group was surprised. They hadn’t expected the two to choose such a straightforward battle.

“Whoever collapses first will suffer greatly!” Luo Tian chuckled, then shifted his gaze to the others. After a brief look, he closed his eyes.

To Luo Tian, there was nothing more to watch. Both likely held back, not wanting other opponents to see their strategies. Thus, they chose to test cultivation for future battles—after all, this competition wasn’t just one match. If they exhausted themselves in the first battle, it wouldn’t be worth it.

Fan Tianyin had unleashed Yin Spirit Nine Transformations because he believed the Rotating Sect was weakest. If they lost, they might be shut out completely.

“Huangtian Sect!” Luo Tian gazed toward Huangtian Sect’s direction. This was the sect that had previously provoked Fu Xingxuan.

As Luo Tian looked toward Huangtian Sect, the big man from that sect was also gazing at Luo Tian’s group. But his gaze wasn’t on Luo Tian—it was on Fu Xingxuan, filled with greed.

Seeing Luo Tian’s gaze, the big man licked his lips and gave a thumbs-up before flipping it.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness, extending two fingers and bending them.

“Haha!” The big man laughed, shaking his head. He ignored Luo Tian and refocused on Fu Xingxuan.

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly, pulling Fu Xingxuan behind him to block the big man’s view.

“This is Yi Jianren! Teach him a lesson—pluck out his eyes!” Fu Xingxuan addressed Luo Tian.

“A despicable man?” Luo Tian chuckled, gazing at the big man. At that moment, Yi Jianren had a woman beside him—dressed provocatively, leaning against his body as he touched her. She showed no shame in the public eye, occasionally emitting giggles, appearing like a seductive wench.

“Don’t worry,” Luo Tian replied to Fu Xingxuan, then closed his eyes to adjust his state.

Time passed slowly. Half an hour had elapsed. In that time, Cheng Ping and Ye Qiu hadn’t stopped moving their weapons, continuously launching sword qi and spear images.

After half an hour of relentless combat, the platform finally decided a victor. Cheng Ping’s group was the first to lose—one loss triggered a chain reaction, causing Equal Sect’s other three members to fall swiftly. If Ye Qiu hadn’t restrained his teammates, the battle would have ended already. The dragon and tiger were gradually annihilated by the sword storm.

“Damn it!” Cheng Ping’s face paled as he watched his dragon and tiger disintegrate. His gaze met Ye Qiu’s, also pale.

“Go!” Cheng Ping was reluctant but his True Immortal power had vanished. His Dragon and Tiger Severing Soul Spear moved frantically, defending against the descending sword storm.

The storm lasted dozens of breaths before vanishing from sight. Cheng Ping, bloodied and battered, appeared in the crowd’s view.

“Ah…” Cheng Ping roared, his eyes filled with resentment. But a graceful figure appeared before him, the sharp aura of a blade pressing against his neck.

“Don’t move!” Ye Qiu smiled, gazing at Cheng Ping. The latter’s breath momentarily stilled.

“Fengdu Sect wins!” Shu Guiwang announced loudly, his voice echoing through Fengdu Sect.

“Unsurpassed! Fengdu Sect’s victory over Equal Sect was effortless!”
“Shura Sect wins!” Almost as Shu Guiwang’s words faded, another voice echoed—Mountain Ghost King.

“Hmph. It seems this year will be a showdown between Fengdu Sect and Shura Sect!” The crowd murmured.

“Next match: Rotating Sect vs. Huangtian Sect!” Shu Guiwang announced, directing his gaze toward Luo Tian’s group as they stood up.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian whispered, leaping into the air and standing on the battlefield. Mo Tian, Wang Gang, and Qiu Long stood behind him, their eyes filled with battle fervor as they faced Yi Jianren’s group.

Defeating Yin Spirit Sect meant nothing. Only by defeating a veteran strong sect could they truly shine. Huangtian Sect ranked sixth, not as top-tier as Fengdu Sect but still a formidable opponent.

“Haha, kid. I won’t let you go down easily. Kill you in front of your woman—should be fun!” Yi Jianren smiled, surprising Luo Tian. The woman clinging to Yi Jianren’s side—dressed provocatively—had also stepped onto the battlefield.

“Kill me? The last person who said that is now annihilated!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with a smile, but Wang Gang and the others shivered, recalling Duan Boyang’s death.

“Your mouth is sharp. Think you’ve beaten those trash and now are equal to us?”
“You’ve already failed. I’ll show you, you’re always trash—trash belongs in its place!” Yi Jianren sneered, his words harsh.

“Damn it, what are you?”
“Luo Senior, give him a good beating!” The Rotating Sect disciples roared upon hearing Yi Jianren’s words. They were enraged, as his insults had insulted the entire Rotating Sect.

“Despicable! You truly deserve your name. I really want to beat that despicable mouth of yours!” Luo Tian’s face bore a smile.

“Kill! I’ll fetch him from the underworld!” Besides Yu Tian, the other three True Immortal beginners glared at Luo Tian with iron faces. They had been scared by Luo Tian’s previous killing of Duan Boyang, so they warned him not to destroy souls.

“We’re trash? Damn it, your whole family is trash!” Fan Tianyin’s group had just awakened and overheard Yi Jianren’s words, so they cursed him loudly.

“You’re all useless. I said it—none of you are worth anything!” Yi Jianren stood on the battlefield, gazing at the Rotating Sect disciples and Fan Tianyin’s group.

“Begin!” As people clamored, Shu Guiwang’s voice finally rang out. He couldn’t bear the noise anymore.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian sheathed Dragon Abyss Sword, taking a step forward toward Yi Jianren. In an instant, his body appeared before Yi Jianren, red divine light flashing as he slashed downward.

“Angry?” Yi Jianren sneered, reaching for the descending Dragon Abyss Sword.

“Crack!” Sparks flew as Luo Tian’s sword sheath was grabbed by Yi Jianren. But within three breaths, Yi Jianren released it and dodged Luo Tian’s attack.

“Don’t run!” Luo Tian chuckled, watching Yi Jianren’s hands now transformed into claw-like forms. He followed closely.

“Strong!” Yi Jianren’s heart jolted—Luo Tian’s power was beyond his expectations.

“Huangtian Ghost Claws!” Yi Jianren roared, his hands radiating dark energy. His arms seemed detached from him, withering and glowing with black qi.

“Buzz…” As Yi Jianren’s arms appeared as if corrupted, a black divine light descended from the sky, slicing down toward Yi Jianren. This time, Luo Tian had drawn Dragon Abyss Sword.

The black sword carried a heavy aura, causing Yi Jianren to frown. His black arms met the black sword.

“Crack!” Fire erupted, Yi Jianren’s body suddenly sank. Luo Tian’s flesh and cultivation were terrifying—this single strike nearly cut Yi Jianren to his knees.

“Haha! Dared to call us disciples trash? Now you’re so battered!” The Rotating Sect disciples mocked Yi Jianren’s pitiful state.

“You’re no better than me! What a fake!” Fan Tianyin shouted, his voice filled with disdain.

“Go…!” Yi Jianren’s face reddened at the harsh voices. He forced Dragon Abyss Sword away and vanished into a black shadow, appearing a hundred feet away.

“Huff…”
“Damn it!” Yi Jianren caught his breath, but Luo Tian’s body was already before him again. Yi Jianren’s body trembled slightly.

“His speed is incredible!” People observing were stunned. Luo Tian’s speed was so fast that even the senior elders at half-step Immortal King only saw a blur.

“His speed is comparable to mine!”
“Previously, he wasn’t skilled in speed,” Hong Tao stood beside Fu Xingxuan’s group, his eyes filled with awe.

“Damn it, do you think I fear you?” Yi Jianren cursed, drawing a yellow long sword and meeting Luo Tian’s Dragon Abyss Sword.

“Crack!” A sharp sound rose. This time, both men retreated, gazing at each other.

“Think having a fierce sword makes you invincible? Many things are no worse than the Seven Fearsome Swords! This Huangtian Sword was my gift for Ye Qiu. I guess it’s time to reveal it!” Yi Jianren’s black ghost claws gripped the yellow long sword, his voice cold.

Chapter 2182: Immortal

A robust body flew out of the barrier. Hong Tao, with a grim face, caught Qiu Long and returned to Fu Xingxuan’s group.

“This is a problem. Yi Jianren’s companion still has strength. If they attack Luo Tian together, he might not withstand it!” The Rotating Sect disciples murmured, their eyes filled with concern as they watched Luo Tian standing there.

“He’s strong, but his companions aren’t!” Others also noticed Luo Tian’s current state.

“It’s a pity. If his companions were stronger, he might have had a chance. But defeating Huangtian Sect this far and forcing Yi Jianren to reveal his secret—this isn’t simple!” Fan Tianyin murmured.

The Yin Spirit Sect and Rotating Sect had always been the underdogs. This time, they were grouped together with a great chance to escape being second place for millennia. But losing meant losing, and they still hoped the Rotating Sect would climb a rank. The Rotating Sect’s leader was the ghostly duo of Black and White Death, while the Yin Spirit Sect’s leader was the ghostly Tianyu Ghost. Thus, their relationship was relatively good.

“It’s a pity,” the Equal Sect disciples also sighed. Luo Tian’s emergence had truly amazed them, but ultimately, it was no match for overall strength.

“Don’t worry. I’m fine,” Fu Xingxuan softly reassured Hong Tao and the others, her voice filled with confidence. Only Fu Xingxuan had such an expression.

“Top three? Dream on!” Yu Tian’s eyes gleamed with cruelty, imagining how he would torment Luo Tian if he failed to enter the top three.

As people sighed, Yi Jianren moved. His face bore arrogance as he raised his Huangtian Sword toward Luo Tian, who had just defeated Qiu Long. The youth who had beaten Qiu Long wiped his blood and vanished into the air.

“Now what will you use to fight us?” Yi Jianren slashed, his yellow sword qi radiating overwhelming authority. It cleaved the sky and swept toward Luo Tian.

A ghostly figure appeared behind Luo Tian, both attacking him in a pincer. The youth snarled and stabbed toward Luo Tian’s back.

“Hear you’re fast!” But before the youth’s dagger reached Luo Tian’s heart, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his ears.

“Buzz…” Before the youth’s dagger touched Luo Tian, his body vanished from their sight. The youth’s dagger only met a ghostly afterimage.

“Fast!” The youth gasped, and Yi Jianren quickly stopped his sword. His gaze was cautious as he scanned the surroundings.

“Where?” The youth’s face darkened. He was skilled in concealment and movement, but now he couldn’t find Luo Tian’s presence.

“Behind you!” The youth’s words had barely finished when Luo Tian’s voice echoed again. Black sword qi shot toward the youth’s heart.

“Damn it!” Yi Jianren and the youth’s faces changed. Especially the youth felt a life-threatening danger, even in his specialty.

“Go…” The youth vanished into the air, appearing a hundred feet away. But upon arrival, his shoulder bore a deep wound.

“Too fast!” People gasped. Everything happened in an instant, and no one reacted until the youth’s body was elsewhere, while Luo Tian vanished again.

“Luck is good!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed, filled with mockery. He hid within the barrier, moving swiftly. He secretly marveled at his suffering in the Sin Mirror—without that torment, he might have found it challenging. But now, he felt the joy of hunting Yi Jianren and his companion in secret.

“Come out!” Yi Jianren roared, sending waves of sword qi from his hands in all directions.

Luo Tian chuckled inwardly. In the Sin Mirror, ten of himself couldn’t catch himself. How could Yi Jianren’s simple slashes find him? It was a dream.

“I can too!” The youth’s face twisted with madness, vanishing from sight as well.

“Though you’re gone, there’s still him!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed. Before the words finished, his black sword appeared behind Yi Jianren, slicing downward.

Yi Jianren roared, sensing the evil wind behind him. He turned swiftly and extended his black ghost claws toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The black sword struck Yi Jianren’s shoulder, peeling off a layer of scales. Yet the ghost claws Yi Jianren had thrown didn’t even touch Luo Tian’s hair.

“Found you!” As Luo Tian vanished, the youth appeared. His black dagger stabbed into empty air.

“Good, I’ll finish you first!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with surprise before it passed. He knew the youth had seized the opportunity from his attack on Yi Jianren, but he didn’t care much.

“Boom boom boom…” Three fists pierced the void, crushing heaven and earth. They collided with the youth’s body.

“Boom!” The three times flesh power fists struck the youth, nearly blowing him apart.

The youth’s dagger cut Luo Tian’s shoulder, drawing a bloodline, but the youth fell to the ground, never rising again.

“Die!” As Luo Tian blew away the youth, Yi Jianren finally seized his chance and unleashed a full-force strike.

Boom boom boom…

A yellow sky enveloped Yi Jianren’s head. Wind howled, and the Huangtian Sword expanded under his withered hand. He slashed downward. The sword qi sliced through the yellow sky, seemingly drawing the entire Huangtian into the sword. It carried supreme heavenly power and massive sword qi, slicing toward Luo Tian.

“This strike can shake a True Immortal peak!” Ye Qiu murmured, gazing at the descending yellow sword.

“Yi Jianren is going all out. He knows if he lets Luo Tian escape again, he’ll be too passive!” The eyeless youth murmured.

“Manifesting the Divine Form of Heaven and Earth!” Luo Tian roared, his body expanding again. Thunderous sounds echoed as Dragon Abyss Sword expanded too.

Luo Tian’s colossal body gripped the black sword, resembling an ancient giant capable of piercing the sky.

Luo Tian’s hands gripped Dragon Abyss Sword, but this time he no longer restrained it. He unleashed the sword’s full power with a single strike.

Savage qi surged into the sky, cold air sweeping across nine heavens. The explosive savage qi began to erode Luo Tian.

“Break…” Next moment, the black sword collided with the yellow sword qi. The sky shattered, and heaven and earth thundered.

One sword against another—each seemed to prove their strength. Time stopped, the collision between Luo Tian and Yi Jianren appeared in people’s sight.

But only a few breaths passed before Yi Jianren’s Huangtian Sword flew from his hand, spinning rapidly and piercing into the barrier. Yi Jianren’s thick scales peeled off again, his body flying backward to land on the ground.

“Now it ends!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, subduing the savage qi. He smiled and waved his hand. The black sword vanished from his grip, flying into the sky.

The black sword carried a powerful aura, as if victorious. It radiated boldness, proving itself the true king.

“What is he doing?” People gasped. They didn’t know why Luo Tian had thrown Dragon Abyss Sword.

“Buzz…” But the next moment, people understood Luo Tian’s actions. The descending Dragon Abyss Sword fell precisely where the youth who had nearly been blown apart by Luo Tian’s fist was.

The beast kings didn’t intervene, as the youth had planned to kill Qiu Long earlier.

“Plop!” The black sword pierced the youth’s heart, pinning him to the battlefield. His life force vanished.

“Go find his soul. I’m sure Huangtian Sect will pay a price for it!” Hunyuan Immortal King murmured, his voice filled with laughter.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian moved swiftly, vanishing from sight before reappearing behind Yi Jianren. He launched a punch.

Boom boom boom… Scales cracked before Yi Jianren, already wounded. Blood spewed as Luo Tian struck him to the ground.

Luo Tian took a step forward, stomping on Yi Jianren’s face with disdain: “Now who is trash?”

“Cough cough…” Yi Jianren spat blood, trying to break free but trapped by Luo Tian. Without hesitation, his foot repeatedly landed on Yi Jianren’s face, each strike shattering more scales.
