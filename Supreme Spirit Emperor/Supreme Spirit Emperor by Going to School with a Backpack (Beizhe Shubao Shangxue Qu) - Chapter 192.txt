When they learned the two men were from the Four Sacred Star Domains, the three of them relaxed slightly. Even the other two men displayed a flicker of disdain in their eyes, though it was fleeting. Yet Luo Tian's sharp gaze did not miss it.

Luo Tian paid no heed to their disdain. After all, everyone knew the Four Sacred Star Domains ranked last among the Nine Domains. Before Luo Tian's rise, not a single Transcendent Realm powerhouse had ever emerged from there.

Luo Tian smiled warmly at the previous man and said, "My brother and I have just arrived in the Flame Domain. How should we address you?"

"Call me Wang Xuanyang," he replied with a smile, "I suppose you're looking for the Flame Domain map. I have one here—take it."

Wang Xuanyang tossed a jade slip into Luo Tian's hands.

"Thank you! Accept this elixir, Brother Wang. It should greatly aid your progression to the Nine Sources!" Luo Tian was not one to take things without giving something in return. He handed Wang Xuanyang an elixir.

"Brother, you're also a cultivator of elixirs? Truly remarkable!" Wang Xuanyang took the elixir without hesitation. Even upon seeing an Imperial Grade Elixir, he showed no reaction.

This behavior surprised Luo Tian greatly. A typical Supreme Realm cultivator would have been overjoyed at the sight of an Imperial Grade Elixir. Wang Xuanyang's calmness suggested he was accustomed to such treasures.

"Brother, go find Aunt Yunting. I wish to refine my body in these flames. When you finish searching, return here to fetch me—or I'll find you once I'm done!" Long Jie addressed Luo Tian.

"Very well," Luo Tian agreed. Searching for Chen Yunting was something Long Jie could not assist with. Though the Flame Domain was much larger than the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian's speed and the star domain map would allow him to complete it in two months.

"Ha! You're quite bold, kid. This temperature is beyond your capacity. A Seven Source Supreme Realm cultivator should stay outside!" An Eight Source Supreme Realm man sneered at Long Jie as he stepped out of the warship.

"Indeed, we're only trying to help. Don't be foolish and lose your life!" Another Eight Source Supreme Realm man echoed.

Luo Tian merely shook his head in amusement. He had no desire to fight such people.

Long Jie ignored them, transforming into a streak of light that vanished into the multicolored flames.

Upon arrival, Long Jie's brows furrowed slightly—evidently unaccustomed to the terrifying heat.

The firestorm instantly enveloped Long Jie, as if consuming him. The two men who had mocked him now wore even more contemptuous expressions.

"Quickly go save your brother. This heat would overwhelm even a typical Nine Source Supreme Realm cultivator. How dare you think this is your Four Sacred Star Domain? A Seven Source Supreme Realm cultivator here is nothing more than a fart! No wonder the Four Sacred Star Domains rank last—such fools!" The two men taunted Luo Tian standing on the ancient warship.

"Die..." A terrifying aura erupted instantly. A childish shout echoed through the flames, its voice youthful yet carrying an inherent authority. Golden lightning pierced the firestorm.

In one instant, the flames surrounding Long Jie shattered, revealing his youthful face.

"This..." The two men who had mocked Long Jie now wore expressions of astonishment. They hadn't expected a seemingly young Seven Source Supreme Realm cultivator to withstand the flames' burning.

Wang Xuanyang was equally amazed. Initially, he'd thought Luo Tian and Long Jie had relied on the ancient warship to pass through the firestorm. Now, he realized his mistake. Suddenly, Luo Tian and Long Jie seemed mysterious to him.

"Hmph. What's the point? No one knows how long you can endure!"

"Exactly! I doubt you'll last more than a few days!" The two men who had mocked Long Jie showed no fear. Long Jie's feat hadn't earned their respect.

"Silence!" Luo Tian's face finally darkened, his brows furrowing slightly. A cold voice echoed in their minds.

Hearing Luo Tian's icy tone, the two Eight Source men shivered involuntarily. Though the surrounding temperature was high, it felt like they were trapped in an ice age. Their faces turned pale.

"Transcendent Realm! I thought the Four Sacred Star Domains had no Transcendent Realm masters. How...?" The two men stammered.

They'd initially planned to provoke Luo Tian and Long Jie, hoping to kill them and seize the ancient warship. Now, Luo Tian had indeed acted—but not even lifting a hand had left them in panic.

Transcendent Realm masters were rare even in the Flame Domain, and they were among its most formidable figures. They weren't people like these small fry.

Realizing their mistake, the two men broke out in cold sweat. They silently thanked their luck for not having acted earlier; otherwise, they'd have been wiped out in an instant.

"Respect your elders! I didn't know you were a Transcendent Realm master. Don't take it personally!" The two men, seeing Luo Tian's cold face, immediately knelt in the firestorm, repeatedly bowing to him.

"Long Jie, keep refining. I'll return after searching around and fetch you. Don't wander off!" Luo Tian ignored them, addressing Long Jie.

"Understood. This place will greatly enhance my body. I might even reach Nine Sources!" Long Jie smiled, then closed his eyes again to battle the endless flames.

"If you harm him, don't blame me!" Luo Tian coldly muttered, his hands moving as two seals were infused into the two men's bodies—afraid they might retaliate against Long Jie.

"Xuanyang Brother, please look after my younger brother. This is my identity jade token. If trouble arises, you can transmit to me directly. Whatever I can do, I'll help!" Luo Tian turned, his face showing kindness as he addressed Wang Xuanyang.

"This..." Wang Xuanyang's expression changed. He'd thought he was merely helping a small favor, but now realized Luo Tian was actually a Transcendent Realm master. He didn't know how to respond.

The two men's faces showed envy as they gazed at Wang Xuanyang. Having a Transcendent Realm master backing them meant in the Flame Domain, they could walk proudly as long as they didn't provoke the three major sects and other Transcendent Realm masters.

Luo Tian ignored their thoughts, controlling his ancient warship to fly toward the firestorm's outer edges.

Chapter 876: The Sacred Dao Domain

Amidst the endless firestorm, Luo Tian guided his black warship through the flames. As time passed, the temperature gradually weakened, and more figures appeared in Luo Tian's spiritual perception.

Some were refining their bodies like Wang Xuanyang, while others had already summoned their alchemical furnaces to refine elixirs in the endless firestorm. This surprised Luo Tian.

"This firestorm's temperature is truly suitable for refining elixirs!" Luo Tian observed the surrounding lightning flashes, his face showing admiration. He even discovered over a dozen places emitting the aura of Imperial Grade Elixirs—this astonished him greatly.

Imperial Grade alchemists were treasures in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Yet here, he'd already seen dozens of them.

Such esteemed alchemists lacking their own life-fire was quite puzzling. However, Luo Tian wasn't overly concerned. He took out the Flame Domain map Wang Xuanyang had given him, pressing it against his forehead. A stream of information flooded his mind.

Wang Xuanyang's map was detailed, not only marking geographical locations but also clearly indicating where the domain's dangers lay and which sects occupied what areas. It even included a comprehensive description of the entire Flame Domain.

"This saves me much trouble!" Luo Tian muttered, his black ancient warship standing out conspicuously. Especially the skull-headed sail still on it, drawing many people's attention.

The Flame Domain was entirely surrounded by terrifying flames. Thus, most of its inhabitants had fire-elemental constitutions. Perhaps due to tradition, the domain's alchemy was extremely prevalent. Legends even spoke of three major sects housing Sacred Grade alchemists.

"Little wonder Wang Xuanyang showed no reaction to my Imperial Grade Elixir. It seems Imperial Grade Elixirs aren't rare here!" Luo Tian chuckled.

Imperial Grade Elixirs were precious in the Flame Domain, but for an Eight Source Supreme Realm cultivator, obtaining one was manageable with a little effort.

"If I have the chance, refining alchemy to the Sacred Grade would be great. But first, I need to find people!" Luo Tian thought, increasing his ancient warship's speed toward the firestorm's edge.

"Wow, this ship is really flashy. Is it a sect's prince?" People marveled at Luo Tian's massive warship, some eyes showing greed while others admiration.

Yet these people didn't act rashly. Those with such a ship were surely not people they could provoke, so they could only admire.

But the firestorm was a mix of dragons and snakes. Luo Tian's ship eventually caught the attention of several people.

Luo Tian's speed wasn't fast or slow. A Seven Source Supreme Realm cultivator could easily match it.

As Luo Tian flew, three figures suddenly blocked his path. The first was a young man around Luo Tian's age, accompanied by two Eight Source Supreme Realm men.

"Kid, your ship is nice. Sell it to me!" The youth smiled, his voice laced with threats. His Seven Source Supreme Realm aura pressed against Luo Tian.

"Idiot!" Luo Tian had no patience for such people. If he hadn't just arrived in the Flame Domain, he'd have already wiped out this fool.

"Move aside..." Luo Tian's face was cold as he spoke, not wanting to clash with them.

"Ah! That's the younger sect leader of Tongyun Sect. Why is he here? Looks like this ship owner is in trouble! No one dares oppose Tongyun Sect around here!" People saw the youth and looked at Luo Tian with pity.

Luo Tian's spiritual perception was formidable. Hearing their murmurs, he knew the Tongyun Sect held significant power in this region. Wang Xuanyang's information had also confirmed this sect existed nearby, with a Transcendent Realm master as its leader.

Having a Transcendent Realm master made it a powerful sect in the Flame Domain. Though Transcendent Realm masters were more numerous than Saint Realms, they weren't by much. For example, the Nine Saint Realms' peak could be ranked first if they had nine Saint Realms and nine Transcendent Realm masters. Thus, Transcendent Realm and Saint Realms were rare. Whether Tongyun Sect had hidden strength was unknown to Luo Tian.

Indeed, the Tongyun Sect held considerable fame in the Flame Domain. Within a million miles, it was all under their control. Thus, this youth's younger sect leader had every right to be arrogant.

But today he met Luo Tian, a Transcendent Realm sect. Luo Tian didn't care about him. The only ones he feared in the Flame Domain were the three major sects and those dangerous places.

"Kid, here's a hundred yuanqi stones. You can go. Remember this was a fair trade. If anyone bullies you, just say my name Ma Xiongcai in this Flame Domain—I'll protect you!" The youth commanded, his face proud as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Hmph. Go to hell..." Cold words came from Luo Tian's mouth. He'd seen too many like this and had no patience. Controlling his warship, he tried to bypass Ma Xiongcai and continue.

Among the crowd, some faces showed coldness as they whispered: "If I'm not mistaken, this is the warship of Star River Four Bandits. Why's it here in the Flame Domain? And only one!"

"Hmph, Star River Four Bandits. I'll never forget the humiliation they brought us. Today, no matter who's on this ship, if it's alone, we can't let it go!" Two Eight Source Supreme Realm men whispered, their eyes showing killing intent toward the ancient warship.

"Kid, you're refusing to take the gift!" Luo Tian didn't care about Ma Xiongcai but that didn't mean Ma Xiongcai would let him go. Within this million-mile radius, Tongyun Sect was the emperor, and Ma Xiongcai was the prince. He'd never failed before. Today would be no exception.

After speaking, Ma Xiongcai and his two Eight Source Supreme Realm men instantly blocked Luo Tian's path. Seven sources of original power formed a mountain, pressing down on Luo Tian. It was an immediate kill move.

"Seems tolerance can't solve problems!" Luo Tian sighed, snorted coldly, and didn't even move. He shattered Ma Xiongcai's original power mountain.

Hearing Luo Tian's cold snort, Ma Xiongcai and his two men were struck like lightning. They stood frozen in place, fear in their eyes. A massive aura pinned them motionless, preventing them from speaking. Their throats felt blocked, unable to open their mouths.

Luo Tian, however, acted as if nothing had happened. He controlled the ancient warship, turning it into a streak of black light that crushed over the three men. Like lightning, he severed them at the waist, turning them into three blood mists instantly devoured by the endless flames.

"This..." The people around were stunned, watching the three blood mists consumed by fire. Their faces showed disbelief. They hadn't expected Tongyun Sect's younger sect leader to be killed so cleanly, with no chance to fight back.

"Big brother, this..." The two men who had previously shown killing intent toward Luo Tian now looked terrified. They saw the black ancient warship gradually exiting the firestorm and stammered.

"What's with the big brother? Stop your killing intent. We're not his match!" The man called 'big brother' said, admiration in his face. He hadn't expected a Seven Source Supreme Realm and two Eight Source Supremes to be killed without any chance to resist.

"Transcendent Realm! Definitely Transcendent Realm. This is going to be interesting. I wonder what face Ma Tongtian, the Tongyun Sect leader, will have after learning of his son's death!" People showed excitement, their eyes on Luo Tian who had disappeared from view.

"Although Ma Xiongcai was a bit of a fool, his father Ma Tongtian is an experienced Transcendent Realm master. I doubt he'll let this go easily!"

"But one Ma Tongtian isn't enough. More people need to be sent against this kid!" The man who had claimed a grudge with Star River Four Bandits said, thinking aloud.

Luo Tian didn't know the consequences of his ancient warship. Even if there were, he wouldn't care. As long as it wasn't a Saint Realm master, he had no fear. Even for a Saint Realm beginner, he had confidence to escape with some cost.

At this moment, Luo Tian was piloting the ancient warship, searching each continent according to Wang Xuanyang's map for information on Chen Yunting's reincarnation.

"Boom..." In Tongyun Sect, a middle-aged man with an imposing face looked at a disciple reporting below him.

"Find him. He mustn't have gone far yet. Whoever it is, even if it's a sect prince from the three major sects, I need to know his whereabouts!" Ma Tongtian's voice was furious. His heart ached.

Ma Tongtian had lived many years, and this son was his only one. Though he could be reborn, Ma Tongtian didn't want to waste time on that.

"Whoever killed my son, I won't forgive!" Ma Tongtian muttered, disappearing from Tongyun Sect. Moments later, he appeared in the firestorm, his eyes scanning it with authority. Finally, he fixed his gaze on Wang Xuanyang and two other Eight Source Supreme Realms.

Chapter 877: Long Jie's Misfortune

Under the endless stars, Luo Tian leisurely guided his ship through the scorching space. Perhaps due to environmental factors, the entire starry sky of the Flame Domain had a red aura. The air was unusually dry but felt comfortable.

Luo Tian searched each planet, quickly finding a massive one with a purple barrier surrounding it. The continent radiated powerful energy, making people feel startled.

"Shanhai Sect!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration as he gazed at the continent emitting purple qi. This was one of the three major sects in the Flame Domain, a vast power occupying a third of the domain. The Tongyun Sect that Ma Xiongcai belonged to was a subordinate force.

" I've searched all nearby continents. Only this Shanhai Star remains. Should I enter or not?" Luo Tian's face showed a slight tension, unsure whether to search this continent.

After all, Shanhai Sect was different from other continents. Other continents had cultivators up to Nine Sources at most, with only a few like Tongyun Sect having one Transcendent Realm master. They wouldn't discover him.

Shanhai Sect was different. According to Luo Tian's guess, these three major sects definitely had more than just Transcendent Realm masters. To dominate the Flame Domain, they must have Saint Realms. It was impolite to search their sects under a Saint Realm's nose.

"Enter, I must check the situation!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He wouldn't miss any chance, even if there was a 90% possibility Chen Yunting hadn't reincarnated here. As long as there was a chance, he wouldn't give up.

Luo Tian muttered, then stored his ancient warship. Entering the continent made it too conspicuous.

In a blink, Luo Tian appeared on Shanhai Continent. He observed the surroundings, habitually spreading his spiritual perception with a slight admiration.

A stream of radiant light flew toward the center of the continent, which must be Shanhai Sect's mountain. The entire Shanhai Continent's core.

Luo Tian watched the figures flying toward Shanhai Sect, recalling how he'd seen streams of light rush into the Shanhai Continent before. He grabbed a six-source Supreme Realm man who seemed easygoing.

"Brother, why are you rushing to Shanhai Sect? Is there something big happening?" Luo Tian asked, his voice showing confusion.

The six-source Supreme Realm man frowned. Upon seeing Luo Tian's young face, he showed surprise. He hadn't expected a youth to stop him.

"Such a big event, you don't know?" The six-source Supreme Realm man looked at Luo Tian as if he were a fool. A youth with such strength must be the disciple or offspring of a sect leader. Shanhai Continent's big event—normal sect disciples should have known the news already and arrived at Shanhai Sect.

"Ah, I didn't know. My master has been secluded for years, and after cultivating successfully, he let me go on a journey!" Luo Tian smiled timidly, like a fresh young man.

"Oh! That's why you don't know about the marriage proposal of Shanhai Sect's sect leader's daughter Du Yuying. Brother, I think you look good. Can you refine elixirs?" The six-source Supreme Realm man looked Luo Tian up and down, jokingly asked.

"A little. Is it a test of refining elixirs?" Luo Tian was puzzled, his eyes flashing with excitement. A bold idea formed in his mind.

"Wow, you're not serious, are you? Don't even think about it. Who knows, the three major sects' top disciples have already rushed to Shanhai Sect to show off their skills, trying to win Du Yuying. It's said she's not only beautiful as a celestial being but also her elixir skills are divine. She's just one step away from becoming a Sacred Grade alchemist. Ordinary alchemists wouldn't catch her eye!" The six-source Supreme Realm man said with longing.

"So it's a test of refining elixirs. After all, alchemy is prevalent in the Flame Domain!" Luo Tian muttered, already thinking of a way to enter Shanhai Sect. A smile appeared on his face.

"Brother, you're not seriously thinking of hoping for it, are you? I tell you, don't even think about it. We people like us should just watch the show. Don't dream of climbing up so fast! Du Yuying is a celestial being, not someone like us. Even if you have the strength and luck to succeed, the other two sects' princes won't agree! They've been eyeing Du Yuying for a long time. It's common knowledge!" The six-source Supreme Realm man shook his head,劝 Luo Tian.

"Brother, what's your name? Let's go together. Maybe Du Yuying will like me!" Luo Tian smiled.

"My name is Xu Zhengwen. We can go together, but brother I advise you not to think too much. You've just entered the Flame Domain and don't understand how powerful these major sects are. Don't let your youth lead to your death!" Xu Zhengwen advised, seeing Luo Tian's eyes shining.

"I'm Luo Tian. Brother Xu is overthinking!" Luo Tian felt Xu Zhengwen was someone worth befriending.

"That's good! Let's hurry. There are seven days until the marriage proposal starts. With our speed, we should arrive before it begins."

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was about to nod, his face slightly changed. A green mark on his arm, like a tattoo, emitted intense heat, making Luo Tian's brows furrow.

Nirvana Dragon Mark—only Luo Tian and Long Jie had. This mark's change indicated something was happening to Long Jie.

"Did he progress?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, guessing what had happened to Long Jie that caused the Nirvana Dragon Mark to change.

But in an instant, a green jade token in Luo Tian's storage ring emitted radiant light. Wang Xuanyang's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his eyes blood-red. A powerful killing intent erupted from Luo Tian's body, like a demon emerging from hell, making Xu Zhengwen tremble.

"Luotian, your brother is in trouble. Hurry!" Wang Xuanyang's voice only said this before disappearing.

"Boom..." In the next moment, the green jade token shattered in Luo Tian's storage ring, making his eyes flash with danger.

The shattering of the identity token wasn't as severe as a魂灯 being extinguished, but it proved Wang Xuanyang was definitely in trouble. Since Long Jie and Wang Xuanyang were together, the probability of Long Jie being in trouble was even higher.

"Brother... brother..." Xu Zhengwen stammered, surprised. He hadn't expected the Luo Tian who had seemed timid just now to be possessed by a demon, making him feel terrified.

"Brother Xu, you go first. I have something to do and must leave for a while. Remember to report my name. I'll definitely arrive before the start! My name is Luo Tian!" A cold voice echoed in Xu Zhengwen's ears, making him startled. Looking up, there was no sign of Luo Tian.

Xu Zhengwen whispered Luo Tian's name, realizing this Luo Tian he had just met was not as simple as he thought. His strength alone was at a level that made him look up in awe.

Xu Zhengwen was only a six-source Supreme Realm. Though he felt Luo Tian was powerful, he didn't know his true strength level—just thought of him as an eight or nine-source young genius.

Luo Tian transformed into a streak of light, flying toward the Flame Domain and Four Sacred Star Domains' border. His heart was full of hope that Long Jie would be alright.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt self-reproach and regret for not leaving Long Jie alone to search for Chen Yunting. He always treated Long Jie like a younger brother. When Long Jie was young and bullied, he had become furious, using his bone-destroying realm to shoot the soul. Now that Long Jie was clearly in danger, how could he not be anxious? A stream of anger radiated from Luo Tian, making the Supreme Realms rushing to Shanhai Sect stop in their tracks, fear on their faces.

...

Amidst the endless firestorm, a golden dragon rolled endlessly. Red seal scripts wrapped around its body.

"Roar..." The dragon roared, golden light radiating from its body. It seemed to want to break free the seal scripts but failed, with the seals tightening around it. Blood continuously flowed from its body, roaring to the heavens. Its massive eyes showed endless anger toward a man less than a thousand feet away, smiling.

"This is a dragon clan. No wonder its body is so strong. Even flames that could kill Seven Source Supreme Realms could be withstood at Six Source!" An Eight Source Supreme Realm man said, admiration in his voice as he looked at the massive dragon rolling in the sky. This man was one of those who had mocked Long Jie.

"Indeed. It seems this dragon is truly from the dragon clan, with extremely rich bloodline. Such dragons are rare now. I guess even in the Beast Domain, such a dragon is uncommon!" Another Eight Source middle-aged man said with admiration.

"This way, Tongyun Sect's master Ma Tongtian has found a treasure. Capturing this dragon as his guardian would be a great help for Tongyun Sect in the future!" Many onlookers said with admiration, looking at the golden dragon spilling blood.

Chapter 878: Pain

Amidst the endless firestorm, a golden dragon rolled endlessly. Its scales and red dragon blood rained down from the sky like blood, making people in the Flame Domain astonished.

Not far away, Ma Tongtian smiled at the dragon's true form—Long Jie. His face showed a sinister smile: "Little dragon, submit to me and be my steed. I'll forgive your useless brother for killing my son. Otherwise, I'll kill you first, extract your dragon sinews, peel off your dragon skin, and then kill your brother!"

Ma Tongtian smiled, feeling his luck was amazing. He had encountered a true dragon clan and saw its bloodline was so rich.

His son could be reborn, but this dragon was one. If he used it as a guardian, it would greatly help Tongyun Sect in the Flame Domain. Even the three major sects would have to fear him.

"Roar..." Long Jie's massive eyes showed deep fear. He felt the red seal scripts with terrifying temperatures embedding into his body, as if tearing apart his flesh and soul. The pain was极致.

Gray original power burst out, forming a powerful dragon breath that rushed toward Ma Tongtian. It was like a river, expressing his determination to resist.

"Flies challenging trees. If you reach Transcendent Realm, I'd be wary. But you? Today even your Transcendent Realm brother here would be killed by me!" Ma Tongtian saw the gray dragon breath, but his face showed disdain. He gathered his Transcendent Realm power and lightly slapped.

The explosion echoed, powerful waves lifting the firestorm. Ma Tongtian stood still, unaffected by the dragon breath.

"Don't struggle. If you submit, I might spare your Transcendent Realm brother. Cultivation is hard—don't waste his future!" Ma Tongtian seemed patient, speaking again.

"Thank you for not killing me! As a gift, I'll let you suffer and die!" Cold words echoed, making everyone including Ma Tongtian tremble.

"Buzz..." A cold killing intent instantly spread to everyone. Though in the firestorm, they felt no heat but like being in endless glaciers.

The cold chill seemed to freeze time. A young figure appeared in people's sight, eyes blood-red. He stood before the rolling Long Jie. A red flash—seeing Long Jie was safe, Luo Tian regained his senses.

"Don't be afraid. Brother's here!" Luo Tian showed concern in his eyes, grabbing the red seal scripts that had tormented Long Jie. He squeezed them tightly, breaking them. Golden sacred power slowly flowed into Long Jie's massive body, transforming him back into human form. His eyes showed anger toward Ma Tongtian.

"Brother, it hurts!" Long Jie's youthful face showed a hint of sorrow, looking at Luo Tian.

Long Jie's expression made Luo Tian move. His face showed affection: "You're already so big, still like a child who hadn't grown up!"

"Ha! But it really hurts!" Long Jie showed a mischievous smile. He knew Ma Tongtian was doomed.

Indeed, Ma Tongtian was already a dead man in Luo Tian's eyes.

Luo Tian's gaze turned to Ma Tongtian, especially seeing the half-dead Wang Xuanyang by his side. His face turned even darker.

Luo Tian hated it when others were harmed because of him. Wang Xuanyang had only met him once, but he was caught in the crossfire.

"Are you this little dragon's brother? Apologize, and I'll let go of killing my son!" Ma Tongtian felt Luo Tian's power. He was somewhat nervous, trying to give him a way out so it would be over. After all, fighting was not easy for a Transcendent Realm master.

Luo Tian didn't speak. He focused on the two Eight Source Supreme Realms who had been with Wang Xuanyang, his eyes showing thought. He grabbed them and brought them to his front.

"Did you say Luo Tian and Long Jie are brothers?" Luo Tian's eyes showed amusement, but his voice carried a dangerous tone. The two Eight Source Supreme Realms looked terrified. They had seen Luo Tian's power before, but now seeing the Transcendent Realm of Tongyun Sect yielding to him, they realized they had underestimated Luo Tian.

"Forgive us! We were forced!" They sweat coldly, one even so scared that liquid flowed from his pants. The heat vaporized it, sending a stench into people's noses.

"Scared to urinate! A Eight Source Supreme Realm man scared to urinate!" People around showed shock, watching Luo Tian with a playful expression.

To others, Luo Tian's eyes seemed nothing. But to the two men, he was terrifying now—like a mountain ready to crush them at any moment.

"Boom... Boom..." Two blood mists exploded. Luo Tian didn't want to hear them speak further. After hearing what he wanted, he killed them instantly.

"Now it's your turn!" After dealing with the two Eight Source Supreme Realms, Luo Tian turned to Ma Tongtian standing still.

At this moment, Ma Tongtian realized he had met a thorn. He had tried to escape while Luo Tian killed the two Eight Source Supreme Realms but felt a chance locking him. Any movement would bring a storm of attacks.

"Half-step Saint Realm!" Ma Tongtian's heart trembled. His eyes showed disbelief at the young face before him.

"Which sect are you from? I don't recognize you!" Ma Tongtian, a long-time leader of Tongyun Sect, quickly calmed himself. He asked, thinking Luo Tian was a sect prince from the three major sects.

"You have no right to ask!" Luo Tian didn't give Ma Tongtian any chance to speak. He flashed, turning into a streak of gold and appearing before Ma Tongtian. His hand swung, slapping Ma Tongtian's face.

In an instant, Ma Tongtian appeared three thousand feet away. His head seemed to have grown three times larger. White teeth accompanied by blood spewed out of his mouth.
