“However, I’ll say this upfront—since we are all from the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan), let’s not spoil our relations. We must follow order, and none of you should be disrespectful to my Southern Ridge clan members. If I find out, the consequences are yours to bear!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze sweeping over those giants before turning and leaving.

“Ah, ah, as long as Master Luo can produce the pills for us, we’ll obey your instructions. Who dares defy Master Luo’s orders? I Wang Tiezhu will be the first to object!” A towering man with a fierce aura spoke loudly.

Wang Tiezhu, the current patriarch of the Wang family in the Barbarian City. His predecessor was the old man slain by Duan Hongfang with a single palm strike. The Wang family now desperately needed an Epoch Peak powerhouse to guard them, and Luo Tian’s pills had become their last hope.

“Yes! As long as we have pills to eat, we’ll abide by the rules!” Each towering figure affirmed repeatedly, obediently lining up.

That night, Chu Chen brought the collected spiritual herbs to Luo Tian’s room and handed him a storage ring.

“Boom…!” Luo Tian opened the storage ring, and a deep sound echoed in his room. The next moment, Luo Tian’s lips twitched.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian stared at the mountain-like pile of items, his face filled with disbelief.

The heap wasn’t spiritual herbs—it was a collection of storage bags. So many stored items piled together, mostly filled with spiritual herbs.

“Barbarians don’t understand alchemy. Some herbs are merely processed, and some are even consumed directly!”

“Other royal clans’ alchemists are few. To refine pills is nearly impossible unless one is an Epoch-level powerhouse, who can pay high fees to seek help from other royal clans,” Chu Chen explained to Luo Tian, observing his shock.

“Damn it, there’s so much!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but speak. He hadn’t expected such a vast amount of spiritual herbs, which would take him forever to refine.

“There’s no choice. For years, the Barbarian Clan has lacked alchemists. Now that we’ve met one, they’ve practically emptied their clan’s spiritual herbs!” Chu Chen smiled, his heart quite pleased. If Luo Tian refined pills, he’d stay in the Barbarian Clan for a while longer. Mang Hun had agreed to return to the Origin Domain with Southern Ridge, and Chu Chen didn’t know when they’d meet again.

“Once I’ve promised to refine pills, even if I have to kneel, I’ll finish them!” Luo Tian sighed deeply and resumed his frenzied alchemy mode.

Yet, Luo Tian was both in pain and joy. This massive batch of pills had emptied nearly all the forces in the Barbarian City, and his income was certainly substantial. Moreover, Luo Tian truly wanted to elevate his alchemy skills again—or perhaps one day attempt to refine immortal pills. For himself and for the Four Sacred Star Domains, an immortal alchemist’s value was immeasurable.

“One month… half a year… one year…” Time flowed slowly. Before long, Luo Tian had spent an entire year in the Barbarian Clan.

Chapter 1696: Reopening the Immortal Burial Coffin()

After a year, Luo Tian finally completed refining all the spiritual herbs of the Barbarian Clan. Though exhausted, he was both in pain and joy.

A massive amount of spiritual herbs filled Luo Tian’s pockets, while a vast number of pills were delivered to various forces in the Barbarian City by Southern Ridge’s people.

The most joyous thing for Luo Tian was that, with this massive batch of spiritual herbs, his alchemy had reached its peak. Even the success rate for high-grade sacred pills was nearly 80%.

Eighty percent was a terrifying probability. Though two more percentages were missing, among the nine domains, few alchemists achieved an 80% success rate for high-grade sacred pills.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, handing the last pill to Shi Dali. He then collapsed onto the ground, his eyes filled with joy.

After a brief rest, Luo Tian immediately lay on the bed and fell into deep sleep. This sleep lasted seven days.

During these more than a year, the strength of the Barbarian City had significantly improved. The sound of breakthroughs often echoed through the city.

This pleased Ma Zhan, Laosama, and Mang Hun. Previously, the turmoil of three families had caused heavy losses to the Barbarian City. With Luo Tian’s massive batch of pills, their strength had recovered and even surpassed before, making the three sigh that allying with Luo Tian was a correct choice.

Luo Tian slept for seven days, slowly opening his eyes. He stood up and walked out of the courtyard. At the moment he stepped outside, Chu Chen, who had been seated in meditation at the courtyard’s entrance, slowly rose. His gaze carried respect toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian had obviously earned Chu Chen’s share of the pills. Now, Chu Chen had advanced to the middle Epoch level. In such a short time, from near-Epoch to middle Epoch—this was something Chu Chen had never dared imagine. Such speed, even for prodigies or ancient royal heirs, was unprecedented.

Later, if not for Luo Tian’s fear that Chu Chen advanced too quickly and his cultivation was unstable, Luo Tian could have forcibly pushed him to the late Epoch level.

“Alright, from now on, it’s up to you. Pills are external things. The resources I gave you are enough for you to reach the Epoch Peak. As for becoming a royal candidate, you must experience it yourself,” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Chu Chen.

Chu Chen’s talent wasn’t bad. He just started later than them, and previously lacked resources in Southern Ridge. With enough time and resources, Luo Tian believed Chu Chen would definitely advance to a royal candidate.

“Elder Brother, are you leaving?” Chu Chen’s face carried sorrowful feelings as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Yes, I’ve stayed long enough. It’s time to go. Return to the Origin Domain and try not to join battles if possible,” Luo Tian nodded, then patted Chu Chen’s shoulder.

“Hmph!” Chu Chen nodded heavily. Then he accompanied Luo Tian to the entrance of the Divine Beast Temple.

“Go back, I hope we’ll meet again in the future,” Luo Tian sighed softly and stepped into the Divine Beast Temple under Chu Chen’s gaze.

“Surely we’ll meet again!” Chu Chen’s eyes carried determination. Then he walked toward the direction of Southern Ridge, planning to withdraw from the Barbarian City and return to the Origin Domain soon.

Entering the Divine Beast Temple, Luo Tian expanded his spiritual sense. He quickly found the location of Laosama and Ma Zhan, then appeared in their grand hall with a flash.

“Preparing to leave?” Laosama smiled and spoke to Luo Tian. The three seemed to have been waiting for him.

“Yes, I came to bid farewell to the two elders,” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Laosama and Ma Zhan.

“You son, I almost wanted to tie you down!” Laosama’s face carried a sigh. Though Luo Tian had spent short time in the Barbarian Clan, it had brought great progress to them. Few could elevate an entire royal clan’s strength in such a short time, except for alchemists.

“Young man, don’t blame me for not warning you. Future battles require your preparation. Our Ancient Royal Clan is no longer as before!” Ma Zhan spoke loudly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Please elders clarify,” Luo Tian’s face slightly tensed upon hearing Ma Zhan’s words. He also wished to know how the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans had changed.

“I previously told you that eight of us have lived second lives. If your human clan still relies on those three top-tier masters, I advise you to stay with us Barbarians. That way, your life might be saved!”

“Also, I’ll be leaving for the Thunder Sea Marshes again in a few days. Qi Hongrui will do the same, as we plan to open the Immortal Burial Coffin again!” Ma Zhan spoke, his voice carrying solemnity.

“Opening the Immortal Burial Coffin again!” Upon hearing Ma Zhan’s words, Luo Tian’s face instantly tensed with confusion.

“We previously opened it and were immediately destroyed by a chance. By sheer luck, we lived second lives. It was precisely the great opportunity within the Immortal Burial Coffin that allowed many prodigies to elevate their strength significantly!”

“This time, we plan to retrieve the items within it. Do you think your human clan has any chance against that?” Ma Zhan’s face carried enthusiasm, his voice filled with excitement.

“Elders, please don’t do this!” Upon hearing Ma Zhan’s words, Luo Tian’s face turned grim. He had also opened the Immortal Burial Coffin before and knew its terrifying nature. Even now, as a near-Epoch Master, he still felt chills.

“Elders, the items within the Immortal Burial Coffin are powerful. But you should also know they contain formidable things. If something is released, the entire nine domains might be devastated!” Luo Tian’s face was heavy with concern.

“Son, we know the items within are terrifying. But we naturally have our confidence. Besides, this isn’t my decision alone; the other seven also agreed to open it again.”

“If we retrieve those items, do you think your human clan will have a chance? That’s why I didn’t want to ally with you before, as I believed your human clan had no hope at all!” Ma Zhan spoke softly.

“Damn it!” Upon hearing Ma Zhan’s words, Luo Tian’s face also turned grim. He knew the items within the Immortal Burial Coffin, if one were taken out, would be heavenly-level artifacts. As Ma Zhan said, they could sweep through the entire human clan.

“Alright, I told you this only to give you a heads-up!” Ma Zhan spoke again before falling silent.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian’s mind was heavy. He knew he couldn’t stop Ma Zhan and the others, nor could he prevent them. Eight masters who had lived second lives—unless one was an Epoch Master, there was no way to resist them.

“There’s another matter I need to ask for your help with,” Laosama spoke softly, causing Luo Tian’s face to slightly tense.

“Elders, please speak freely!” Luo Tian replied. He had helped the Barbarian Clan so much to prepare for future battles.

“Yes, we’ve recorded all these favors. If the human clan truly can’t resist, we’ll definitely protect you and your family!” Laosama spoke directly, calming Luo Tian.

“Star Moon Divine Clan previously also experienced similar turmoil. The royal heir’s rebellion had the shadow of your human clan. I suspect their three families are also related to Star Moon Divine Clan’s rebellion. Therefore, after returning to the human clan, I hope you go to Star Luo Domain and see what exactly this ‘Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance’ is!” Laosama spoke softly, his voice carrying coldness.

“Star Luo Domain?” Upon hearing Laosama’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes slightly tensed. Though he didn’t know how Laosama and the others had discovered this ‘Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance,’ he still nodded in agreement. He also wanted to go to Star Luo Domain and see what this ‘Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance’ truly was.

“Let Mang Hun accompany you. He can also help a bit!” Laosama spoke again, as the Barbarian City only needed one person to guard it.

“This…” Upon hearing Laosama’s words, Luo Tian hesitated. Though Mang Hun was strong, his identity was quite sensitive.

“Don’t worry; our Barbarian Clan also has methods to conceal our aura. It won’t trouble you!” Laosama’s gaze carried a slight smile.

“Alright,” Luo Tian nodded. Then he looked at Mang Hun, whose face had turned slightly gloomy. Luo Tian’s hesitation clearly implied some disdain for him.

After discussing further, Luo Tian put on the Thousand Mirage Mask to transform into a Barbarian giant’s appearance. He and Mang Hun flew out of the Barbarian Clan continent, appearing under the gray starry sky.

As soon as they emerged, they headed toward the entrance of the Mortal Domain. While flying, Luo Tian noticed people still searching for him within the Mortal Domain.

However, with Mang Hun present, Luo Tian didn’t worry about his identity being exposed. Also, Qi Hongrui, who had lived a second life, was likely preparing to head for the Thunder Sea Marshes. He wouldn’t have time to bother Luo Tian. The two traveled smoothly and arrived at the entrance of the Mortal Domain.

They avoided the guards at the entrance. Luo Tian and Chu Chen transformed back into human forms, appearing under the familiar starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Let’s go. Head to Star Luo Domain!” Luo Tian didn’t return to the Tianyuan Continent but spoke to Mang Hun. However, just as they took off, Luo Tian’s jade token emitted a continuous humming sound. A string of information appeared in his mind, causing Luo Tian’s face to slightly change.

Chapter 1697: The Starry Palace Was Destroyed()

“Luo Tian, hurry back. The Starry Palace was destroyed!” Jiang Nanxuan’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his face to instantly change.

Subsequently, a massive amount of information flooded into Luo Tian’s mind. It included messages from the Divine Clan, the Revenant Domain, and the Demon Clan, but all revolved around the Starry Palace.

Luo Tian’s heart surged with waves. He knew the Starry Palace was the core of Star Luo Domain, and Zhou Wei’s sect. Since its establishment, no one had dared to provoke it. Luo Tian hadn’t expected the Starry Palace to be destroyed.

“Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance!” Luo Tian muttered softly, his face filled with concern. Previously, he hadn’t taken the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance seriously. Though he knew it was strong, in the current Four Sacred Star Domains, no one feared any sacred sects. The only deficiency was their depth.

The destruction of the Starry Palace meant that the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance’s strength had exceeded Luo Tian’s expectations. Apart from the Ancient Royal Clan, another force could now destroy a sacred sect.

“What’s wrong?” Mang Hun looked puzzled at Luo Tian, who had stopped and wore a grim face. He didn’t know why Luo Tian halted or why his expression was so dark.

“Nothing, our plan has changed. We need to return to the Tianyuan Continent!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly and then flew toward the direction of the Tianyuan Continent.

Mang Hun naturally didn’t object to Luo Tian’s decision. Though he had some knowledge of other domains, none compared to Luo Tian’s deep roots. He could only obediently follow behind Luo Tian.

The two flew for half a day and arrived at the outskirts of the Tianyuan Continent. Mang Hun looked at the continent with a sense of awe, his face showing admiration.

“I heard that the Tianyuan Continent was originally insignificant. I didn’t expect it to be so powerful!” Mang Hun’s face showed his first admiration, gazing at Luo Tian. Clearly, much of this power came from Luo Tian’s efforts.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian looked puzzled. He extended his vast spiritual sense into the continent, then slightly furrowed his brows.

“Where are they?” He muttered softly. His spiritual sense revealed that the entire Tianyuan Continent, except for the ancient heavenly palace floating above it, only had elders like Luo Xiong. Others such as Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi were nowhere to be found.

“Buzz…” Upon Luo Tian’s spiritual sense spreading, Luo Xiong and others sensed it. Their faces slightly straightened.

Upon discovering Luo Tian instantly, his figure appeared in the grand hall. His face carried concern as he bowed to Luo Xiong and others before asking, “Grandfather, where are they?”

“Back?” Luo Xiong looked happy upon seeing Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected him to return so quickly.

“Don’t worry, they’ve all left!” Luo Nan Tian saw Luo Tian’s anxiousness and spoke softly.

“During your time infiltrating the Mortal Domain, we’ve also experienced some major events. The Starry Palace in Star Luo Domain was destroyed by someone!”

“Only Zhou Wei and Zhou Tianxing escaped with tens of thousands from Star Luo Domain!”

“They arrived here in our domain. Since Zhou Wei had some connection with you, he also helped you before. Therefore, we took them in!” Luo Nan Tian spoke softly, recounting the events to Luo Tian.

“However, Zhou Wei and others brought a message: the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance’s strength is indeed built by your enemies. Its power is terrifying and shocking. According to Zhou Wei, there are three or four Epoch Masters’ offspring within it!”

“And this is just what was revealed when they attacked the Starry Palace. Zhou Wei also brought news that these people have accumulated such strength to target you. Their personalities seem twisted, like madmen!”

“The Starry Palace was destroyed because they wanted to fully control Star Luo Domain and gradually invade surrounding areas. Most importantly, they targeted Star Luo Domain’s forbidden zone!”

“Shortly after you left, in Star Luo Domain’s forbidden zone—Star River Mansion—the situation changed. A stream of immortal energy emerged from Star River Mansion, enveloping it!”

“Before Zhou Wei and others could organize people to investigate, they were attacked by the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance. The Starry Palace also had traitors, with two-thirds of its people betraying it. Surrounded by internal and external attacks, the Starry Palace was destroyed. Now, Star Luo Domain has become the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance’s!” Luo Nan Tian spoke softly.

“With such terrifying strength, and unknown depth, the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance has caused chaos among all sacred clans. They came to our Four Sacred Star Domains and discussed with us. Each clan sent strong forces to Star Luo Domain, trying to probe the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance’s depth. After all, with the Ancient Royal Clan preparing for war, if internal chaos arises, it would be problematic!” Luo Xiong assisted, recounting the entire situation.

Luo Tian’s heart sank. He hadn’t expected the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance to be so powerful. Even Zhou Wei and his son, whom Luo Tian himself feared, had been defeated. He hadn’t expected the Starry Palace, which had long existed in Star Luo Domain and was known for its foresight, to be taken over so easily.

“What’s the current situation? How long have they been there?” Luo Tian asked, gazing at Luo Xiong.

“Two months. However, they’ve had no news so far. You don’t need to worry too much. Many strong forces have gone there, almost half of the sacred sects’ strength has entered Star Luo Domain. After all, Star River Mansion has immortal traces; there must be great opportunities. No one wants to miss out. The Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance trying to monopolize it is impossible!” Luo Nan Tian spoke softly, but his gaze carried concern.

At this time, the Ancient Royal Clan was eyeing them closely. Meanwhile, the human clan had encountered the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance as a complication. Most of their strong forces had entered Star Luo Domain, leaving the human clan unusually empty. If the Ancient Royal Clan’s army attacked at this moment, the entire nine domains would be unable to resist the iron cavalry of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans.

“Where are Grandfather and Master Dongbo? Did they also go?” Luo Tian then inquired about Gu Tianshu. If Gu Tianshu and Master Dongbo had also gone, perhaps Luo Tian could feel more at ease.

“Grandfather of the Gu family is still in the Fire Domain. After all, now the human clan is too empty; it’s necessary to have strong forces guarding it!” Luo Xiong spoke softly.

“Hmph, I’ll go to Star Luo Domain now. Let me see what the situation is!” Luo Tian nodded, and since Gu Tianshu hadn’t gone, he had no choice but to go himself. Only then could Luo Tian feel at ease. These people were closely related to him, and if anything happened, he couldn’t even imagine it.

“Let’s go…” Luo Tian finished his brief instructions and then flew out of the Four Sacred Star Domains with Mang Hun, rushing toward Star Luo Domain.

The two flew at high speed and passed through the Demon Beasts Domain, the Divine Beasts Domain, and the Revenant Domain in three days, arriving at Star Luo Domain.

Along the way, Luo Tian passed through several sacred sects and found that they were unusually empty except for a few strong forces guarding them.

Luo Tian and Mang Hun stood under the starry sky, where a mysterious feeling spread. Star rivers hung upside down, and stars emitted light, illuminating the entire Star Luo Domain’s starry sky.

“Beautiful!” Mang Hun and Luo Tian couldn’t help but gaze at the vast starry sky, their eyes filled with a touch of enchantment.

However, beneath this beautiful starry sky was a bloodstained atmosphere, causing Luo Tian and Mang Hun to slightly frown.

“It must be the residual energy from when the Starry Palace was destroyed!” Luo Tian, as a Soul Sealing Master, was extremely sensitive to spiritual souls. He could sense that the starry sky of Star Luo Domain carried scattered, incomplete spiritual souls.

“Let’s go,” Luo Tian sighed deeply and gazed into the depths of the starry sky, his face showing a touch of anxiety. He didn’t know how his friends and family were doing.

Then, Luo Tian led Mang Hun toward the massive continent in their line of sight. That was Star Luo Domain’s core, the Star Luo Continent, once the foundation of the Starry Palace.

However, this place could no longer be called Star Luo Continent. It was now known as the Ten Thousand Heavens Continent.

The two didn’t fly too fast. After all, this place was no longer the Starry Palace’s domain and was controlled by some of Luo Tian’s enemies.

After flying for a day, Luo Tian and Mang Hun finally arrived at the outskirts of the continent. They gazed at the dazzling continent.

An invisible wave enveloped the entire continent, like an invisible barrier. If someone rashly entered, they would certainly be detected by the people inside.

“Let’s just break in?” Mang Hun looked eager, gazing at Star Luo Continent.

“No, we don’t know the situation inside. We can’t rashly enter!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, his face carrying concern. The fact that they had uprooted the entire Starry Palace showed this Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance must have an extremely terrifying strength.

“What if we just stay here and wait?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Mang Hun became impatient.

Just as Luo Tian was thinking about how to enter Star Luo Continent, several figures stepped on the stars and flew toward Star Luo Continent. This caused Luo Tian’s face to show a hint of joy.

“Got it!” Luo Tian smiled, looking at the familiar figures. Then his figure flashed toward them.

“Everyone, hello!” Luo Tian suddenly appeared in their line of sight. The flying figures immediately startled and stopped their movement, about to scold him. But upon seeing it was Luo Tian, their faces changed instantly.

“Luo… Luo Tian…” One middle-aged man in black robes stammered, never expecting Luo Tian to appear at this moment outside Star Luo Continent.

Chapter 1698: All Old Acquaintances()

“Luo… Luo Tian…” The figures’ faces turned pale, staring at Luo Tian and unable to speak for a moment.

“Unexpectedly, you still recognize me. We are old acquaintances. I have something to ask for your help!” Luo Tian signaled Mang Hun, who stood behind the figures with his strong body, blocking their escape route.

“What do you want to do, Luo Tian?” The figures trembled with fear, gazing at Luo Tian. Especially seeing the smile in his eyes, they instinctively shivered.

There were six people: two elders, two middle-aged men, and two young ones. All twins. Upon seeing them, Luo Tian immediately recognized they were from the Yin Yang Sect, his enemies.

“Nothing much. I just need your lives for a while!” Luo Tian had no good feelings toward the Yin Yang Sect. He had also heard that within the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance, the Yin Yang Sect was a pillar. They were the loudest among the alliance’s several strong sects.

These six people were likely important figures in the Yin Yang Sect. The two elders and middle-aged men were at the late Epoch level, while the two young ones were at the middle Epoch level.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. Knowing these people weren’t good, and they were after him, he extended his golden hand to strike them.

A powerful pressure immediately descended upon them. They couldn’t even think of resisting, let alone escape under the pressure of Luo Tian’s golden hand.

Crushing. Complete crushing. These people couldn’t resist against Luo Tian, and were directly hit by the golden hand, turning into a cloud of blood. Their gray spiritual souls still carried fear and were captured before Luo Tian.

“Soul Sealing!” Luo Tian spoke softly. The spiritual pressure on their souls made them instantly dazed, their eyes filled with confusion.

“Hmph?” However, during the soul sealing process, something unusual happened. Their spiritual souls emitted a repelling force as if wrapped in an invisible barrier, making it impossible to seal their souls.

“Soul Sealing Curse?” Luo Tian’s face showed a slight smile, but this smile was cold.

“Another Soul Sealing Master?” Luo Tian pointed his finger, sending an invisible wave from his hand. At the same time, the methods on their spiritual souls were neutralized.

Meanwhile, their memories appeared in Luo Tian’s mind. The memories of their misdeeds were excluded, and only useful memories were extracted.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face turned cold. He then waved his hand, and their spiritual souls were instantly annihilated in his hands.

“What’s wrong?” Mang Hun looked puzzled at Luo Tian, not knowing why his face was so grim.

“They deserve to die!” Luo Tian replied to Mang Hun. Then he continued, “This Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance specifically targets ordinary continents, seeking the blood of virgins. They extract it! As for what they do with it, they don’t know themselves—only that they hand it over to the sect’s master!”

“Moreover, my friends and others from the nine domains seem to be targeted by this Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance. As for how they target them, these people don’t know. It seems related to the forbidden zone of Star River Mansion!” Luo Tian’s face was heavy with concern, his eyes icy.

“Then we should go to that forbidden zone quickly!” Mang Hun’s face carried battle spirit as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Hmph, but we still need to disguise ourselves first and check out Star Luo Domain’s situation!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly. Then he waved his hands, concealing their auras. He then crushed the storage rings of the six people and made various items float before him and Mang Hun.

Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing the items. He took a token-like object and handed it to Mang Hun.

“Take this token; it shouldn’t be discovered!” Luo Tian sighed deeply and took out a jade bottle from the six people’s belongings. He pointed his finger, and the bottles exploded with a loud noise.

“Crash…!” Bloodstained air immediately spread through Luo Tian and Mang Hun’s perception. A long river of blood flowed under the starry sky, with gray mist swirling within it, resembling faceless figures. Though somewhat blurred, Luo Tian and Mang Hun could still discern that these weak spiritual souls were very young.

“Reincarnation!” Luo Tian sighed, striking a fist and creating an invisible reincarnation channel under the starry sky.

“I can only help you this far!” Luo Tian gazed at the blood river and then grabbed the gray spiritual soul fragments, sending them into the vast reincarnation channel. Then he waved his hand, and seven-colored flames completely refined the blood.

“Real pigs!” Mang Hun’s face carried coldness and killing intent. Though he also hated the human clan, he hadn’t reached such a depraved level as to attack ordinary people.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his heart filled with killing intent. Though he didn’t know what these people wanted so many virgins’ blood for, he knew it couldn’t be anything good.

“Hmph!” Mang Hun nodded. The two had filled their hearts with killing intent toward the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance and then flashed into Star Luo Domain with the token of the Yin Yang Sect.

“Buzz…” A vast spiritual sense spread from Luo Tian’s body. The next moment, the entire continent’s appearance was imprinted into Luo Tian’s mind.

“Not a single near-Epoch Master?” The next moment, Luo Tian was puzzled. His spiritual sense found no one who could threaten him.

“Let’s go to the Starry Palace!” He spoke, and with Mang Hun, they flew toward the massive building at the center of the continent.

“Who are you?” As soon as they approached the Starry Palace, a series of scoldings echoed in their ears. Several figures flew out from the Starry Palace, their faces cold.

“Luo Tian!” However, when they flew close to Luo Tian and saw his face, an old man shouted loudly, his eyes filled with fear.

“Do you recognize me?” Luo Tian looked puzzled at the old man. The old man’s cultivation was at the Epoch Peak level. Though it was strong in the previous nine domains, it wasn’t rare in this era.

“Luo Tian!” The old man’s words had just finished when a series of cries arose within the Starry Palace. A group of figures flew out from the massive Starry Palace, their faces filled with hatred and fierce gazes toward Luo Tian.

Soon, a group of figures filled the sky. A torrential hatred rose from these people.

“Ah?” Luo Tian looked at those figures with overwhelming energy, his eyes also showing coldness. Some of these people he recognized, others he didn’t—yet he recognized their clothing.

“Luo Tian, what are you doing here in our Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance?” The old man spoke loudly, scolding Luo Tian.

“Don’t waste words. Where are the people from our Four Sacred Star Domains and other sacred sects?” Luo Tian spoke coldly, not wanting to waste time with these people.

“Who are you? Do we have to tell you?” The old man spoke coldly.

“You think I’m something? We won’t tell you!” One of them said, their voices carrying strong resentment.

“You don’t think I’ve forgotten?” The old man spoke again. “When you destroyed the Thunder Domain’s Thunder Palace, did you ever think of this day!”

“Indeed! You killed two generations of our Yin Yang Sect’s Grand Masters. This hatred is eternal. We hadn’t found you yet, but now you’ve come to us!” Two voices echoed simultaneously, their tones filled with intense resentment.

“Hmph. Do you think I’ve lost my sect’s lineage?” A voice with a neutral tone echoed.

“Indeed, our He Dao Sect’s Grand Master was also killed by you…” Another voice echoed, causing Luo Tian’s face to show coldness.

“Truly old acquaintances!” Luo Tian muttered softly. He hadn’t expected to have so many enemies over the years.

“You really are a troublemaker!” Mang Hun looked at these people with strong resentment, who shouted and cursed Luo Tian. His mouth stretched.

“I’ve done nothing wrong. I’ve honored heaven, earth, and my conscience. Those I killed deserved it!” Luo Tian coldly smiled, his voice not loud but resolute.

“Don’t waste words. Move aside! Let us enter Star River Mansion!” Luo Tian sneered and spoke clearly, stating his purpose. At this moment, the Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance had many strong forces but no near-Epoch Masters. For Luo Tian and Mang Hun, it wasn’t a big problem.

“Luo Tian, do you think our Ten Thousand Heavens Alliance is so easy to enter? Today we’ll make sure you don’t return. Do you think your near-Epoch Master status allows you to roam freely? We are no longer the sects you could easily destroy!”

“Deploy the Ten Thousand Heavens Killing Array!” The next moment, eight Epoch Peak masters stepped out from the crowd. They had just received orders to keep Luo Tian here.

“Roar…” A series of roars echoed. The entire Starry Palace’s figures began to move, gathering together. A stream of light converged into one, with eight Epoch Peak masters positioned at the eight corners. A torrential energy rose from nearly a million cultivators.

“Buzz…” The next moment, a massive array formed by a million people evolved into a blood-colored ghost-like figure. A blood-red cloak covered the ghost, and it held a blood-red sickle.

Chapter 1699: Entering the Starry Palace()

The blood-colored figure radiated an astonishing aura, holding a blood-red sickle. Luo Tian’s eyes immediately narrowed.

“This array isn’t simple,” Mang Hun stood in front of Luo Tian, his face also showing a touch of concern. Especially seeing the black qi rising from the eight array eyes,凝聚 at the ghost’s eye position.

“This doesn’t seem to belong to the nine domains,” Mang Hun spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian. Luo Tian’s eyes also showed intense surprise.

“This aura is so familiar!”

“Though it doesn’t belong to immortal energy, it feels like the same as immortal energy. However, immortal energy gives a sense of authority, while this aura feels cold and merciless!” Luo Tian spoke softly, continuously recalling where he had encountered such an aura.
