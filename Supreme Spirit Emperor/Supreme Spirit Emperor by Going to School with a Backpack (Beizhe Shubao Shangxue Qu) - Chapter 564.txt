„Give me the reverse!“ Luo Tian's cultivation technique circulated, no longer suppressing the toxins within his body but instead directing them through his technique.

„Since you want to kill me, today I'll fight with all my might!“ Duan Boyang's eyes flashed madness. At this moment, he realized Luo Tian was determined to end his life.

„Today I'll show you my final secret!“ Duan Boyang roared, his hands moving swiftly. A torrent of divine immortal power burst forth from his palms, forming a dark cloud that enveloped the sky.

„Today it's either you die or I perish! Even if I must pay a price, I'll kill you. This is all your doing!“ Duan Boyang raged, seizing the moment Luo Tian was detoxifying to imprint seals into his black cloud.

„Duan Boyang, are you about to use your last resort?“ Wang Gang and others exchanged glances, their eyes fixed on the thick black cloud.

„Get out!“ At the same time, Luo Tian spat forth a five-colored whip from his mouth - the very toxins within his body.

„Buzz...“ As Luo Tian expelled the toxins from his body, nine black magic suns appeared in the sky, blotting out the heavens. Each radiated an oppressive pressure.

A cawing sound echoed as dark figures emerged from Duan Boyang's hands, flying toward the nine magic suns.

„What are those?“ Everyone was puzzled. They had never seen such creatures before.

Black phoenix bodies, their forms shimmering with divine laws. Most striking were the three-footed birds.

„Those are!“ Luo Tian's heart trembled as he watched the nine dark figures emerge, his mind filled with murderous intent.

„Three-Footed Golden Crows!“ Luo Tian recognized the creatures instantly. Their aura matched that of the nine princes from the Nine Domains Crow Clan.

„These strange birds suddenly appeared outside our Tian Gui Wang City. My father captured them, extracted their souls, and let me use them to enhance my martial arts!“

„My father had quite the struggle capturing these little birds!“ Duan Boyang's eyes gleamed with pride.

Chapter 2147: Harm

Chapter 2147 Harm

Nine black three-footed golden crows, seemingly mindless, soared into the sky toward the nine magic suns. Intense black flames erupted from the magic suns.

Luo Tian watched the nine crows enter the magic suns, memories flooding back. The Nine Domains Crow Clan had once been formidable, their nine princes shining brighter than any others among the ancient immortal clans. Even though they had been enemies, over time Luo Tian had let go of their feud.

Luo Tian believed if the Nine Crow Princes were alive, they would have smiled at him and not held grudges, just like when he met Jin Yang Xi. Though they had been enemies, after Luo Tian became the Lord of the Epoch and brought peace to all races, the Crow Princes had joined him on the immortal path. Yet now they faced this fate.

„We of the Nine Domains are not to be insulted!“ Luo Tian's eyes burned with killing intent. He slowly drew his Dragon Abyss Sword, releasing a terrifying aura.

The overwhelming aura fused with Luo Tian's killing intent, forming a devastating storm that shook the heavens.

„Gods, I'll kill them!“ Luo Tian roared, his eyes crimson as he stared at Duan Boyang. At this moment, both Duan Boyang and his son had become targets for death.

Though Luo Tian wasn't yet strong enough to challenge the Tian Gui Wang, this didn't lessen his hatred.

„Is that Luo Tian's凶剑?“ Everyone's eyes widened in shock, staring at the aura-piercing Luo Tian.

The soul-destroying aura surged, Dragon Abyss Sword appearing for the first time in a long while. Its broad blade shimmered with cold light, divine immortal power flowing into it.

„Nine Sun Illuminating Heaven!“ Duan Boyang trembled at Luo Tian's crimson eyes, pressing his hand into the void.

„Boom...“ The roaring sound echoed as nine magic suns shattered space, rushing toward Luo Tian.

„One Sword Piercing Immortals!“ A cold voice echoed through the heavens as Luo Tian's hands moved, unleashing a world-destroying sword beam from Dragon Abyss Sword.

The sword intent split the sky, the entire heavens pausing as a lightning bolt flashed beneath the black sky.

The overwhelming sword energy radiated with blood-red light, matching Luo Tian's crimson eyes.

The entire world fell silent. Everyone was stunned by the infinite power in that sword beam, speechless.

Boom... Boom...

As people gaped, nine magic suns exploded violently. A wild surge of energy swept outward, instantly turning Duan Boyang's courtyard into ruins.

The terrifying turbulence struck both Luo Tian and Duan Boyang, the dust swirling as their figures vanished from sight.

„Buzz...“ The sword beam didn't stop after destroying the nine magic suns but flew toward the heavens.

„Eight Directions Releasing Treasures!“ As the sword beam seemed to pierce through space, Luo Tian's voice echoed from the dust.

The nearly escaped sword beam suddenly shifted direction, slicing through the mist and entering it.

Duan Boyang spat blood, struggling to stand. As soon as he rose, his head was severed by the descending sword beam.

Blood sprayed, Duan Boyang split in two, collapsing before everyone's eyes.

Dragon Abyss Sword returned to its sheath. Luo Tian took a deep breath, his red eyes fading. He reached out, and nine black soul fragments appeared above him.

He tossed the gourd again, pouring a flood of Yellow Spring Water over the nine crows.

Purifying energy spread, the nine black souls gradually faded, glowing with golden light.

„Goodbye!“ Luo Tian watched the circling figures, a smile on his face. He wasn't an immortal king to control heaven and earth or reshape flesh, nor could he restore their memories. He could only send them into reincarnation.

Cawing echoed as nine three-footed crows circled above Luo Tian, their golden eyes showing gratitude.

Though memories were erased, they instinctively felt familiarity with this person, sensing their fate.

A pulling force arose. The golden three-footed crows gradually faded from sight.

„Luo Chen, you've caused great trouble!“ Wang Gang's face darkened as he looked at Luo Tian's smiling face.

„Hurry and inform the Holy Woman to intercept Duan Boyang's soul, have the Deputy Grand Master reshape his body!“ A disciple spoke urgently, flying toward the second level.

„No need. He has no chance at reincarnation!“ Luo Tian reached out, a pulling force emerging from his hands. Gray soul energy rose from Duan Boyang's two halves.

The gray soul, resembling Duan Boyang, showed fear.

„What technique is this!“ Seeing Duan Boyang's soul in Luo Tian's hands, everyone's faces showed disbelief.

„How could anyone seize a soul from reincarnation!“ Everyone's faces showed shock.

The eight Grand Masters of the Reincarnation Hall also looked shocked. Initially, they weren't worried since the Reincarnation Hall controlled the first gate of reincarnation. Even if one of their prodigies died, they could retrieve them and reshape their bodies.

Thus, even though they had watched Duan Boyang's battle with Luo Tian and felt the power of Dragon Abyss Sword, they hadn't expected Luo Tian to seize Duan Boyang's soul. This was a big problem. A single Duan Boyang wasn't scary, but he was the favorite son of Tian Gui Wang and the heir to the throne. Duan Boyang's death would surely anger Tian Gui Wang.

„Damn it!“ The eight Grand Masters' faces darkened, then they quickly flew toward the thirty-third level.

„Don't anger Luo Tian. If he dies, he's truly dead!“ Wang Gang and others trembled, staring at Luo Tian as if seeing a monster.

„Luo Chen, you're being reckless. If Duan Boyang dies, this will be uncontrollable!“ Su Dan spoke loudly, trying to persuade.

„Luo Chen, what do you want? You just wanted a courtyard!“ Duan Boyang's body was almost crying, but as a soul he couldn't cry.

Regret. Duan Boyang hadn't expected things to turn out this way. He had no face, but he could have given him the courtyard. He had endured when Luo Tian was weak, yet now he couldn't control himself. His life was gone.

As a soul, Duan Boyang felt Luo Tian's terror - an instinctive fear of his soul. If Luo Tian wanted to kill him, it would take only a thought.

„Don't kill me! I'll give you everything. I promise, my father won't trouble you!“ Duan Boyang cried loudly.

„Wicked one, stop!“ As Duan Boyang's words finished, a furious voice echoed in everyone's ears. A powerful pressure swept over them, and the eight Grand Masters appeared.

„Luo Chen, quickly release Duan Boyang's soul!“ Yu Tian spoke urgently, his eyes piercing Luo Tian. Immortal King aura surged, causing a crackling sound on Luo Tian's body.

„Chen'er, release Duan Boyang!“ Du Jianxing also spoke to Luo Tian, his voice carrying helplessness.

Luo Tian stood there, trembling violently. His eyes met the eight Grand Masters above the sky, flashing coldness.

„If I die today, would Duan Boyang let me live?“

„If I release Duan Boyang, would Tian Gui Wang let me live?“ Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying disdain.

„No!“ Du Jianxing shook his head. He had dealt with Tian Gui Wang before, knowing his lustful and vengeful nature.

„Then it's settled!“ Luo Tian sneered, and in everyone's shock, Duan Boyang's soul exploded into swirling gray mist in his hands.

„You dare!“ Yu Tian was furious. Besides Du Jianxing, the other Grand Masters were all extremely angry.

„Boom...“ The entire world froze. Terror pressure crushed Luo Tian, while Yu Tian extended a large hand with black flames, pressing down on him.

The terrifying energy instantly enveloped Luo Tian, but his face still held a smile as he looked at the descending hand.

„Buzz...“ From the red sword sheath, a black sword broke free. The sound of breaking echoed from it - the breaking sound came from the Hundred Demons Sealing.

Faced with an Immortal King's attack, Luo Tian couldn't resist. He had to fully unseal Dragon Abyss Sword, relying on its soul-destroying aura.

„Boom...“ Soul-destroying aura surged skyward, enveloping a million miles.

The cold soul-destroying energy even broke through the Immortal King's pressure, allowing Luo Tian some movement. Dragon Abyss Sword fell into his hands.

The cold soul-destroying energy instantly rushed into Luo Tian's body. His eyes turned red, and he radiated an eerie aura.

„Buzz...“ Black sword energy shot out from Luo Tian, colliding with Yu Tian's hand.

„Puke...“ Next moment, Luo Tian's body flew back, blood spewing like money from his mouth.

„I knew it. Dragon Abyss Sword in your hands is a disaster. Since you came to the Reincarnation Hall, there's been too much trouble. Today is the perfect time to eliminate this disaster!“

„All of this is your own doing!“ Yu Tian spoke coldly, his voice carrying indifference.

„Boom...“ Luo Tian fell to the ground in a messy way but quickly stood up. His eyes met Yu Tian's: „If you say I'm a disaster, let me show you what a disaster looks like!“

Chapter 2148 Courage

„I want to see how you become a disaster. Are you relying on your family's support?“ Yu Tian's face showed contempt, sneering as he raised his hand again.

Pressure filled the air, imprisoning heaven and earth. A thousand feet around became Yu Tian's world. He stood there as the master of this realm, an Immortal King's domain.

„Then watch!“ Luo Tian held Dragon Abyss Sword in his hand, a mad look on his face. Only the presence of Dragon Abyss Sword could prevent him from being suppressed by this terrifying domain.

„Boom...“ The roaring sound echoed. A black hand pressed down again, making Luo Tian's face show a cold smile.

„Crack...“ As the hand pressed down, a terrifying pressure arose. Du Jianxing extended his hand, sending a sword beam that cut through the black hand pressing on Luo Tian.

Yu Tian's domain also shattered, freeing Luo Tian. He looked at Du Jianxing.

„Boom...“ The sword beam cut through the black hand, creating a powerful wave that swept across the heavens.

„Master Du, are you still protecting him?“ Yu Tian's face darkened as he looked at Du Jianxing.

„He is my disciple. You have no right to touch him! Even if he makes mistakes, you can't teach him!“ Du Jianxing spoke softly.

„Master Du, if we don't kill him, how can we calm Tian Gui Wang's anger?“ Yu Tian's face turned angry.

„Indeed, Master Du, this kid has caused too much trouble!“ Other Grand Masters also spoke, their voices carrying confusion.

„I said he is my disciple. I'll handle Tian Gui Wang!“ Du Jianxing sneered, his aura radiating authority.

„Master Du, have you considered the Reincarnation Hall's interests? Tian Gui Wang is a king. Though his strength isn't as strong as our Reincarnation Hall, he's not under our control! If he finds other halls and they find excuses to attack us, we won't be able to handle it!“ Other Grand Masters spoke.

Clearly, this time they didn't support Du Jianxing. They believed Luo Tian should be killed to calm Tian Gui Wang's anger, thinking one Luo Tian was not as important as Tian Gui Wang.

„What did I do wrong?“

As the arguments continued, a hoarse voice echoed in people's ears. Luo Tian's eyes were red, his breath heavy as he looked at the Reincarnation Hall elders.

„Who set this rule about competing for other disciples? I took Duan Boyang's courtyard. What did I do wrong?“

„When I first came to the Reincarnation Hall, many disciples blocked me outside. Some elders even tried to take me. Did I say a word?“

„The hall's gate was bloodied before I could enter the Reincarnation Hall!“

„After entering, I followed the hall's rules to compete. The eight little kings also fought me!“

„If I didn't have some strength, I would have died many times already! What rule did Luo Chen break?“ Luo Tian's voice carried coldness as he looked at the eight Grand Masters.

„You say this rule was set by you. I followed it all. Why do you want to use me to calm Tian Gui Wang's anger? What is this rule then?“

„If you had said the Reincarnation Hall couldn't kill people, would I have killed?“ Luo Tian shouted. His body radiated coldness and terrifying soul-destroying energy.

„In the end, you call me a disaster and shift all blame onto me!“

„You, old bastard, and Huo Tianzun, have been eyeing my Dragon Abyss Sword from the start. You found all kinds of reasons to kill me!“

„I'm not someone you can bully! Today, if I die, I'll make you pay the price. You'll regret it for life!“ Luo Tian kept speaking.

„Dragon Abyss Sword, the one on Luo Chen's back is indeed one of the Seven凶Swords!“ Hearing Luo Tian's words, many disciples and elders' faces were shocked.

„Yes, I am looking at you as an ant. What's your problem? I'm an Immortal King, stronger than you by several levels. Strength means you can do whatever you want!“ Yu Tian sneered, looking down at Luo Tian.

„Crash...“ A series of black pills appeared in front of Luo Tian. These were the Fei Gui Pills!

„Reincarnation!“ Luo Tian struck again, a gray path appearing above his head.

„You guard reincarnation. I'll destroy this reincarnation today and see who's tougher!“ Luo Tian's face showed ferocity, his blood-red eyes filled with madness.

„Reincarnation path! My god, how did he do it!“ Everyone's faces showed shock. Even the eight Grand Masters' faces were shocked.

„Damn it, I know why this kid caught that person's attention. He is the reincarnation child!“ In the first level of the Reincarnation Hall, a figure sat cross-legged. Half black and half white, his eyes showed disbelief.

„Die!“ Yu Tian's eye twitched but he bit his teeth and pressed down on Luo Tian.

„Master Du, you're going too far!“ Du Jianxing flew up and sent a finger to cut through the hand.

„You, block Master Du. I'll take the blame!“ Yu Tian told the other Grand Masters.

„Okay!“ The Grand Masters nodded, blocking Du Jianxing. Six domains instantly trapped Du Jianxing.

„You!“ Du Jianxing's face darkened, looking at the deputy Grand Masters with anger.

But even if Du Jianxing was strong, he couldn't fight back against the domain pressure from several deputy Grand Masters. Immortal King battles weren't ordinary fights; they also involved domain suppression.

„Kid, I want to see who can save you now!“ Yu Tian sneered and pressed down again.

„Of course, myself!“ Luo Tian roared, Dragon Abyss Sword erupted again. Instead of fighting Yu Tian's hand, it cut toward the massive reincarnation path.

„Stop!“ A dignified voice echoed again, like thunder in people's ears. The eight deputy Grand Masters' bodies slightly paused.

„Boom...“ Luo Tian's sword beam and Yu Tian's pressing hand exploded, the roar of power making everyone tremble.

A black-and-white figure appeared in the sky. His two-colored eyes looked at everyone, finally landing on Luo Tian.

„Grand Master!“

„Respect Grand Master!“ Everyone's faces showed shock. They hadn't expected this to summon the Reincarnation Hall Grand Master.

„Grand Master has merged!“ Then Du Jianxing and others saw the two clearly separated figures in the sky, their eyes showing joy.

„Immortal King! Peak!“ Yu Tian trembled as he looked at the black-and-white figures standing.

„Our Reincarnation Hall finally has a true peak Immortal King!“ Other Grand Masters' faces showed excitement.

„This battle, our Reincarnation Hall won't be passive anymore!“ They spoke.

In hell there are eighteen levels, and the Reincarnation Hall only controls one reincarnation level. Other nine halls control two each because they have peak Immortal Kings. The Reincarnation Hall's black-and-white figures can briefly merge to achieve peak Immortal King power, but they aren't true Immortal Kings. Thus, they are the weakest among the ten halls because of their Grand Master's weaker power.

As for other strengths, the eight Grand Masters and Reincarnation Hall disciples are no weaker than others. In fact, they're even stronger.

„From today, Reincarnation Hall disciple Luo Chen is our Grand Prince. No one may harm him without my permission!“

„Those who violate the order will be considered traitors to the Reincarnation Hall and not reborn!“ The black-and-white figures spoke coldly, their voices carrying authority.

The words made everyone's faces shock. They looked at the black-and-white figures standing in the sky.

„Grand Prince!“ Everyone was confused, looking at Luo Tian. They didn't understand why the black-and-white figures said this. The black-and-white figures' words left people puzzled.

„This is settled. Everyone go back to your duties!“ The black-and-white figures didn't explain, raising their hands. The reincarnation path above the sky disappeared from people's sight.

„This...“ Everyone's faces were stunned, looking at Luo Tian. But they guessed it was because Luo Tian could summon the reincarnation path.

„Damn it, what is this Luo Chen? He can survive even this!“ Wang Heng stood in the crowd, looking at Luo Tian who was repeatedly using the Hundred Demons Sealing to reseal Dragon Abyss Sword.

„Huff...“ Luo Tian took a long breath, gulping down several mouthfuls of Yellow Spring Water to remove the soul-destroying energy. His eyes regained clarity.

Luo Tian was also stunned. He had almost lost control just now; the soul-destroying energy in Dragon Abyss Sword was too霸道.

Feeling much less soul-destroying energy, Luo Tian took the gourd down. His hands moved, sealing Dragon Abyss Sword. He looked at Yu Tian with mockery.

„Old man, come on! Kill me!“ Luo Tian shouted, pointing at Yu Tian. His voice carried arrogance.

„You...“ Yu Tian's face darkened, and the faces of other deputy Grand Masters also looked grim. Only Du Jianxing had a slight smile.

Yu Tian couldn't adjust to his identity. He hadn't expected the Luo Tian he once saw as an ant would suddenly become a Grand Prince on par with them.

After Luo Tian's insult, Yu Tian and others wanted to kill him but dared not. This order was set by the black-and-white Grand Masters.

„Chen'er, don't be impolite. They are your elders!“ Du Jianxing smiled slightly, looking at Luo Tian. But in his eyes, there was encouragement.

Luo Tian was about to curse again when Yu Tian and others turned their bodies, reluctantly flying back to their residences.

„Don't forget to come to my place to cultivate sword intent!“ Du Jianxing smiled, satisfied. Seeing the Grand Masters leave reluctantly, he told Luo Tian to go there and disappeared from people's sight.

Chapter 2150: Reincarnation Pool Opens

„Can't take it?“ Fu Xingxuan's face was flushed, looking at Luo Tian.

„Have you seen a lecher? I feel like a little lamb about to be eaten by her!“

„Sometimes when I was cultivating, she would barge in with disheveled clothes and say she wanted to cultivate with me... And when I got up normally in the morning...“ Luo Tian kept complaining to Fu Xingxuan, reporting his troubles so she wouldn't misunderstand what he saw.

„She's just like that. If you really mean it, she won't act this way!“ Fu Xingxuan laughed.

„Actually, she's a pitiable person!“

„When Su Dan just came of age, she had an enchanting physique that was very attractive to men!“

„Originally, the position of the King of the Tortured wasn't meant for Su Dan but her brother!“

„But Su Dan's brother was too despicable. He had improper thoughts about his own sister and almost succeeded!“

„But luckily, it was discovered early. Otherwise, Su Dan's life would have been ruined! But the story didn't end there. Her brother even framed Su Dan for seducing him!“

„The King of the Tortured was furious and had Su Dan imprisoned in a lightning prison for a month! Finally, the King of the Tortured felt some pity and let Su Dan out of prison. But after she came out, her personality changed completely. Although no one had done anything to her in prison, every day she was stared at by men with lustful eyes. This left Su Dan with trauma and made her hate all men!“

„After coming out, Su Dan didn't become depressed. Instead, she used her unique advantages to gain resources and eventually dismembered her beastly brother, becoming the successor of the King of the Tortured!“

„But although Su Dan's behavior and clothing are not proper, she is a very good person. However, she has a resistance towards men. In her eyes, men are all tools to be used and none are good!“ Fu Xingxuan spoke softly. She knew this because she was close to Su Dan.

„What a pitiable person!“ Luo Tian spoke softly, not expecting Su Dan to have such a past.

Although Luo Tian could imagine how difficult it was for Su Dan to reach this point as a woman, he hadn't expected it to be so hard.

„I'm luckier than Su Dan. I have a caring brother, and you, Qian Xue, Qiu Chan...“ Fu Xingxuan smiled, leaning against Luo Tian.

„If it's not too extreme, you can help her a little. But don't go over the line. I'm close to Su Dan, but not that close!“ Fu Xingxuan frowned and warned Luo Tian.

But when it came to brothers, Fu Xingxuan's face darkened. Although Luo Tian had found his brother, there was no news about Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue.

„Don't worry. Your two brothers aren't easygoing; they should be fine!“ Luo Tian comforted Fu Xingxuan, sighing deeply.

„I wonder how Nan Gong Yuqing and others are doing in the Immortal Realm!“ Luo Tian sighed.

He knew that to gather all the Nine Domains people together, he needed to establish a faction so everyone would know about it. But forming such a faction was too difficult, whether in the Immortal Realm or Hell.

Because Luo Tian was just a small True Immortal mid-level. To establish a sect or control a faction, one needed to be an Immortal King at least. That was the only way to last.

„Don't worry, we've just been here for a few years. There's still a long way to go!“ Fu Xingxuan noticed Luo Tian's helplessness and spoke softly.

„Roar...“ As they talked, a series of roaring sounds rose from the flowing Yellow Spring Water, making Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan startle.

„Boom...“ Next moment, the Tortoise emerged from the water, appearing in Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan's sight.

„Buzz...“ The Yellow Spring Water quickly stirred, with beams of divine light rising from the river below. It seemed to have penetrating power, directly piercing through the Reincarnation Hell and instantly shining on the first level of Reincarnation Hell.

„Is the Reincarnation Pool about to open?“ Fu Xingxuan stood up, her eyes showing a smile.

„Reincarnation Pool?“ Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion. He had heard of the Reincarnation Pool since arriving at the Reincarnation Hall, but he didn't know what it was for.

Yellow beams rapidly broke through to the second level, third level...

In an instant, the entire ninety-nine levels of the Reincarnation Hall were enveloped in yellow light. It wasn't over yet, instantly bursting out of the Reincarnation Hall and striking into the black sky.

A black vortex appeared in the sky, roaring as a sound of flowing water fell from the heavens. Gray spring water seemed to flow from another realm onto the Reincarnation Hall's sky.

The Tortoise roared and flew out, its massive body instantly appearing outside the Reincarnation Hall. Its body suddenly expanded, turning into a black cloud. The Tortoise's body seemed to vanish, leaving only its shell to receive the flowing gray spring water.

„Seven days later, the Reincarnation Pool will open. The disciples of the thirty-third level can enter the Reincarnation Pool!“ The voices of the black-and-white figures echoed in people's ears, making Reincarnation Hall disciples excited.

„The Reincarnation Pool. Anyone who enters it will definitely improve their level!“

„In the Reincarnation Pool, one day equals a year. The time flow is three thousand world flows! So cultivation becomes twice as effective, and there are also some opportunities in the Reincarnation Pool!“ Disciples of the Reincarnation Hall became excited.

„I'm already at thirty-fourth level. If I win a courtyard in the thirty-third level, I can enter the Reincarnation Pool!“ All disciples started to sharpen their fists.

„Once in the Reincarnation Pool, cultivate well. I'll have Xiaoming help you!“ Fu Xingxuan smiled, her eyes shining.

As for Fu Xingxuan herself, she didn't need to worry. The Tortoise would naturally leave her a place. Her current strength was also due to the Reincarnation Pool.

„Hehe, having a wife is great!“ Luo Tian kissed Fu Xingxuan's face.

„The Tortoise isn't here anymore. Should we have some fun? We were uncomfortable with that guy being here!“ Luo Tian smiled, then started to touch her.

„You're annoying. We just did...“ Fu Xingxuan hadn't finished speaking when Luo Tian pressed her onto the gray long bridge.

...

With the appearance of the Reincarnation Pool, the entire Reincarnation Hall became lively. Every day there were countless battles. Except for those with no hope, all disciples with some strength rushed toward the thirty-third level.

Luo Tian, Wang Gang, and Su Dan were no one dared to challenge. However, in the past few days, other courtyards in the thirty-third level had been constantly changing hands. Every day there were battles.

Luo Tian occupied two courtyards next to Duan Boyang's using his strength, one given to Zhang Tiantian and another to Ye Chen.

No one said anything about Luo Tian's actions. Other small kings had occupied more courtyards, and as a Grand Prince, Luo Tian occupying two was already good.

Not only did the disciples of the Reincarnation Hall get excited, but surrounding forces also noticed the large tortoise shell on top of the hall. Their eyes showed envy.

„Reincarnation Pool? I need to find a way in!“ Outside the Reincarnation Hall, Yang Huanyu carried an Abyssal War Halberd on his shoulder. A smile appeared on his face.

If Luo Tian saw Yang Huanyu, he would be shocked. Yang Huanyu had advanced to True Immortal mid-level and his aura was unusually dense, matching Luo Tian's as an Extreme Dao True Immortal.

Time slowly passed. Seven days had gone by. As time passed, the yellow light in the sky gradually faded. The flowing gray river also stopped.

„Time's up!“ The voices of the black-and-white figures echoed again. Those still battling in the thirty-third level were instantly transported elsewhere.

„I'm glad I made it!“ Disciples remaining in the thirty-third level showed relief, their eyes excited.

„Almost there. I was just one step away from success!“ Those who were moved away were disappointed.

„Boom...“ Roaring sounds echoed in the thirty-third level. The entire thirty-third-level hall trembled violently.

The roaring caused everyone in the thirty-third-level hall to vanish from the Reincarnation Hall. When people regained their senses, they found themselves under the sky.

Gray ocean waves rolled. Luo Tian stood on the sky, looking at the gray sea like a lake, his eyes showing admiration.

„Grand Prince, remember to protect me!“ Su Dan came beside Luo Tian, her face妩媚 as she spoke.

„Of course!“ Luo Tian laughed and grabbed Su Dan's hand. He clearly felt a resistance when he touched her hand.

„That's what you said!“ Su Dan leaned against Luo Tian's chest. Others saw them, thinking they were intimate.

„You're a bastard!“

„I'll stop him from drowning!“ Many Reincarnation Hall disciples saw their posture and cursed.

„A fool who doesn't take advantage!“ Luo Tian gritted his teeth, recalling Fu Xingxuan's words. His other hand rested on Su Dan's waist and started to be mischievous.

„Hehe, Grand Prince, I'm scared of tickling!“ Su Dan laughed and stepped out of Luo Tian's arms.
