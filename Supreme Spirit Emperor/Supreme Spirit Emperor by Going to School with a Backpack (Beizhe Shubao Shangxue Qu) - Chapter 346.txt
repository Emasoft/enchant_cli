“Break it!” Without Luo Tian’s support, Ding Yiyuan’s aged eyes gleamed with ecstatic joy. Luo Tian had guessed correctly—he was nearly drained.

“You little brat! This time, how do you plan to survive?” Ding Yiyuan sneered, his hands swirling as black flames roared skyward, surging toward Luo Tian.

“Haha…” Free from the barrier’s suppression, the black flames instantly enveloped Luo Tian and Xiao Qi entirely, causing Xiao Qi to beam with joy.

“Hum…” In the next moment, the black flames transformed into a terrifying vortex and surged into Xiao Qi’s mouth.

“What’s happening? Why won’t my flames obey me?” Ding Yiyuan’s face paled, a foreboding sense rising within him.

In an instant, Ding Yiyuan witnessed a scene he would never forget—a boy coughing out black smoke, patting his belly with satisfaction.

“Full… full!” Xiao Qi shouted, voice laced with laziness as he stretched his limbs, gazing at Ding Yiyuan.

“Father, he’s truly a good man!” Xiao Qi pointed at Ding Yiyuan, eyes filled with gratitude as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Indeed, he’s a good man!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up as he gazed at Xiao Qi. At this moment, Xiao Qi had visibly grown taller, standing around ten years old, his speech now fluent.

“You… you…” Ding Yiyuan’s eyes widened in horror as he stared at Xiao Qi, finally understanding why his demonic flames had dwindled—this seemingly harmless boy had devoured them.

“Thank you, old man. You’re truly a good soul. You may now die!” Luo Tian’s form erupted with power, waves of strength radiating as he instantly appeared before Ding Yiyuan.

“Dao’s Seal of Demon!” He lunged forward with a punch, its might earth-shaking.

“Die!” Ding Yiyuan’s face turned ashen. The previous summoning of his flames had drained him severely, leaving him weak.

Yet Ding Yiyuan, once a great power, extended his withered fist to clash against Luo Tian.

“Crack…” The sound of splintering echoed as Ding Yiyuan’s withered form was sent flying, his entire arm shattering like a dry branch.

“Cough… cough…” Ding Yiyuan coughed violently, collapsing into the void, utterly devoid of blood to expel.

“Old man, send you to your death!” Luo Tian glared at Ding Yiyuan’s weakened form, a smirk on his face as he lunged forward. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword flashed with radiant lightning, piercing Ding Yiyuan’s body.

Lightning surged, its destructive force instantly spreading through Ding Yiyuan’s body, causing him to convulse violently.

“Back then, Master Zhonglii managed to subdue you, intending to grant you a path to survival. Yet you lived on, still harming Master Zhonglii’s descendants!” Luo Tian showed no mercy, his foot descending heavily upon Ding Yiyuan’s body.

“Boom…” Ding Yiyuan, exhausted and battered, glared with fierce resentment before Luo Tian crushed him underfoot.

“Ah… I won’t accept this!” A grey soul emerged, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“I’ve lingered so long… yet I still couldn’t escape the fate of being slain by a reincarnation!” The grey soul howled, frenziedly burning itself, determined to perish alongside Luo Tian.

“Seal the Soul!” Luo Tian scoffed, his hand gesturing as an imperial aura descended upon Ding Yiyuan’s soul.

“Die!” Luo Tian clenched his hands in the void, and Ding Yiyuan’s formidable soul shattered into wisps of ash, drifting through the grey void.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his eyes filled with admiration. A great power had perished.

Ding Yiyuan, once a near-Epoch Lord who had vied for the title of Epoch Lord with Master Miaoyin, Luo Tian could imagine how brilliant he had once been. Yet in the end, he fell to a mere mid-Epoch disciple of this era—truly bittersweet.

“How many great powers still linger in the world, existing through what means? The Epoch Lords must surely be alive!” Luo Tian mused silently.

“Even near-Epoch Lords and Epoch Masters could survive through special means. Thus, the true Epoch Lords must have never perished!”

“Did they truly become immortals?” Luo Tian murmured, then shook his head. The Epoch Lords were too distant for him; without special opportunities, he remained a novice of the early Epoch.

As Luo Tian mused, a sense of crisis surged within him again, making him turn sharply with tension in his gaze.

Yet when he turned and saw the source of the threat, he relaxed. His eyes fell upon a youth who had brought him this sense of danger.

“Awakened?” Luo Tian spoke softly, attempting to greet the youth.

“This sleep was too long,” Zhong Zixuan’s eyes held melancholy, gazing at the puppet beside him. His white hands gently brushed over its rusted form, speaking softly.

“This was the toy my father and mother made for me. Now only he remains to accompany me. Even Uncle Soul has left me!” Zhong Zixuan seemed not to see Luo Tian, his eyes filled with reminiscence.

“Still you!” He then grasped the Qiankun Yun Shen Flower beside him, sighing softly: “Back then, my mother loved to place this flower on her head and ask my father if it looked good!”

“Hiss…” Luo Tian stood there, not interrupting Zhong Zixuan. Upon hearing his words, he involuntarily inhaled sharply.

“An immortal herb as an ornament, a late-Epoch puppet as a toy. Only Epoch Lords could have such grandeur!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

Yet soon, he felt a pang of sympathy for Zhong Zixuan. In the entire world, all his family and friends had perished—left alone to live in solitude. How tragic! Luo Tian doubted he could endure such loneliness.

Chapter 1398: Approaching the Four Sacred Star Domains

“Who are you?” Zhong Zixuan finally emerged from his reverie, gazing at Luo Tian with inquiry. He had witnessed Luo Tian slay Ding Yiyuan and knew Luo Tian might be protecting him.

“I am Luo Tian…” Luo Tian replied, discomfort stirring within him. The man before him was from several epochs ago yet bore the same youthfulness, even matching his age.

“Thank you,” Zhong Zixuan nodded lightly, not continuing the conversation. His eyes turned wistful again.

“What are your plans next? Would you like to come with me back to our domain?” Luo Tian invited Zhong Zixuan to accompany him to the Four Sacred Star Domains. The man now had no home; such a powerful ally would be wasted if not taken back.

“Nah, I plan to travel the Nine Realms and see how they’ve changed. If I grow weary, perhaps I’ll return,” Zhong Zixuan chuckled, declining Luo Tian’s offer.

“Then I shall take my leave. This is the Four Sacred Star Domains; when you’re weary, come find me on Tianyuan Continent,” Luo Tian nodded, not pressing further.

“Farewell!” Zhong Zixuan waved his hand, the late-Epoch puppet materializing before him and vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, stepping out of the spatial realm and reappearing atop the Broken God Cliff. He gazed at the solitary figure of Zhonglii’s fleshly form, a bittersweet emotion stirring within him.

Zhong Zixuan knelt before Zhonglii’s fleshly form, his face filled with longing. The puppet stood cold and motionless.

“Master Shihun!” Luo Tian gazed at the empty altar. The massive body of the Soul-Eater Beast had vanished, his heart aching. He ignored Zhong Zixuan’s tears and descended from the Broken God Cliff.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian just stepped out of the cliff, his identity jade token rapidly buzzed. A cacophony of voices flooded into his mind, making him feel a headache.

“Die!” Yet after organizing the information, Luo Tian’s face turned icy. He flashed toward the direction of Tianyuan Continent.

……

Tianyuan Continent, in these days since Luo Tian’s departure, had become lively. All major sects with some strength had gathered here. Though these sects were not as formidable as the Holy Sects, they were still considerable forces. With the great changes in the world, their strength had also increased.

“Let Luo Tian come out and meet us!” Many sects shouted at Wuxing Mountain, their voices laced with impatience.

“Yes! How many days has it been? Luo Tian hasn’t appeared yet?”

“Is the rumor true? That Luo Tian is truly an Ancient Royal Clan descendant, hence why he won’t meet us?” The entire Tianyuan Continent was in chaos. Vast forces roared across the Four Sacred Star Domains and even the entire Nine Realms.

At Wuxing Mountain, Wuxing Sect members looked grim. Luo Tian had been away for nearly ten days, and these people had been shouting here for almost the same duration. Initially, they were somewhat orderly, but later injuries to Wuxing Sect and Tianyuan Continent residents occurred.

Who was Luo Tian? To the people of Wuxing Sect and Tianyuan Continent, he was a godlike figure. How could they tolerate others insulting him? Conflicts arose frequently, even Zheng Xin couldn’t manage it.

Almost all influential forces in the Nine Realms had arrived except for a few major powers. Though each individual sect wasn’t significant, their sheer number formed a terrifying force. Even the Four Sacred Star Domains’ Tianyuan Continent couldn’t抗衡, effectively opposing the entire Nine Realms—no one could achieve that.

“Damn it! Who started this rumor? Don’t let me find out!” Gu Lei and others gathered, their days filled with chaos. Yet they hadn’t discovered who spread the rumors.

“Luo Tian, why hasn’t he returned? If he just appears once, this crisis should be resolved!” People’s faces bore worry. They vaguely felt an invisible hand pushing the Four Sacred Star Domains into the spotlight. If mishandled, it would be a blow to both Luo Tian’s reputation and the Four Sacred Star Domains’ name.

“Boom…” As they pondered, change finally occurred. The various forces seemed to have conspired, surrounding the entire Tianyuan Continent.

“Four Sacred Star Domains! Let Luo Tian come out and meet us. If he doesn’t, we’ll attack!” Countless voices echoed outside Wuxing Sect, some even attempting to use martial arts to assault the sect’s mountain gate.

“Damn it! We’ve given them enough face!” Gu Lei and Zheng Xin looked grim, stepping out of Wuxing Sect’s mountain gate. They involuntarily inhaled sharply.

At this moment, the Wuxing Sect’s mountain gate was densely packed with people, surrounding them completely. No end in sight.

“Where did these people come from? Are they going to attack us Tianyuan Continent?” Xu Liyi jumped, then quickly recoiled.

“I see Xu Liyi! Don’t hide anymore! Come out!”

“Yes, hurry and give us an explanation!” As Xu Liyi appeared, someone in the crowd spoke out, causing people to become excited.

“Xu Liyi! Let Luo Tian come out and meet us, or is it true that Luo Tian has allied with the Ancient Royal Clan? Or have you all of Tianyuan Continent allied with them!” The crowd roared.

“Did you find out who said it?” Jiang Nanxuan’s gaze was deep, scanning the crowd with his spiritual sense. Yet he found no one who had spoken.

“Never mind, go out,” Jiang Nanxuan sighed, stepping out of Wuxing Sect.

“Jiang Nanxuan!” As Jiang Nanxuan appeared, the crowd briefly fell silent before becoming even more fervent.

“Everyone, Luo Tian has gone out. We don’t know how long he’ll be away. If you wish to meet Luo Tian, wait. But please don’t harm the people of Tianyuan Continent!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his aura calm yet causing the crowd to quiet.

“Ridiculous! We came and he left. He doesn’t want to meet us, does he? We just want to confirm if Luo Tian is truly an Ancient Royal Clan hidden among humans. Is that too much? We’ve waited for him, which is already a hero’s treatment!” Jiang Nanxuan’s words quieted the crowd momentarily but were soon met with another voice, laced with dominance.

“Which friend dares to come out and meet us?” Jiang Nanxuan chuckled, his calm gaze scanning the crowd but still finding no one.

“What use is it meeting us? We’re all here. You still need Luo Tian to come out!” Someone sneered in the crowd.

As the words ended, the entire Tianyuan Continent roared again. A cacophony of voices filled the air.

“Who is your sect?” As people roared, a cold voice echoed from the sky. A white streak of light pierced through the heavens like a meteor, appearing beside Jiang Nanxuan in an instant.

“Luo Tian!” Everyone roared, their gazes turning to the figure standing beside Jiang Nanxuan, his aura overwhelming.

“Truly alive!” The crowd roared again, all faces filled with shock as they gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly in the sky.

“Who is your sect?” Luo Tian held a middle-aged man, his voice cold as he stared at him.

This man had been shouting in the crowd. Now captured by Luo Tian, his body trembled violently, surprised he had been caught.

“Soul-Search…” Before the man could answer, Luo Tian’s voice rang out. The man’s memories flooded into Luo Tian’s mind.

“Haihai Sect, annihilated!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed through the sky. The man’s body turned into a mist of blood before the astonished crowd.

After this, Luo Tian glanced at Xu Liyi standing there, nodding to him.

“Damn it! I’ve been itching to beat these bastards for a long time. Finally found them!” Xu Liyi cursed, his form flashing toward the transmission array of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“This…” The crowd murmured, watching the mighty Luo Tian in the sky. All of them involuntarily inhaled sharply.

“Too strong!” Someone finally spoke, their voice laced with mockery.

“He’s so ruthless; this proves Luo Tian is fake, a manifestation of the Ancient Royal Clan. Let’s all attack and annihilate this Ancient Royal Clan. Also, Wuxing Sect must have colluded with them; they can’t be left alive!” Another voice echoed in the crowd.

“Yes, attack him!” Others joined in, causing the crowd to roar again.

“I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian stood atop the sky, his eyes flashing with radiant light, piercing through space as he scanned the crowd. He struck again, a white Epoch hand emerging from his palm and seizing another middle-aged man.

“Qingfeng Sect, annihilated!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out again. The man’s body turned into a mist of blood before Luo Tian.

Chapter 1399: Sword Pointing at the Underworld

The Wuxing Sect fell silent, watching Luo Tian in the sky. They hadn’t expected him to be so iron-fisted—returning, he immediately aimed to annihilate two sects.

As Luo Tian’s words ended, Zheng Xin shouted and flew toward the transmission array as well.

“Are they really going to annihilate sects?” People watched Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin’s retreating figures. They had heard of the two sects Luo Tian mentioned; though not renowned in the Nine Realms, they had a couple of near-Epoch level disciples. With Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin’s strength, they could easily annihilate the entire sect.

“Ferocious, domineering, iron-fisted!” Watching Luo Tian’s methods, people began to believe it was truly him. In their memories, Luo Tian had always been so domineering.

After a brief silence, someone spoke again: “He is the Ancient Royal Clan. Everyone attack and kill him!”

Numerous martial arts techniques flashed out from the crowd, rushing toward Luo Tian. Though some were stunned by his aura, many still chose to believe and attacked, a storm of martial arts techniques rising into the sky toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian sneered and waved his hand, a streak of golden light flashing. A powerful aura descended upon everyone’s heads, and the ancient heavenly palace atop Wuxing Mountain roared forth, expanding in power and emitting an ultimate aura.

“Suppress!” Luo Tian pressed his hands into the void, the golden heavenly palace radiating overwhelming power and instantly suppressing the storm of martial arts techniques.

“Boom…” The powerful storm of martial arts techniques was no match for Luo Tian’s ancient heavenly palace, collapsing instantly. The violent waves overturned many people.

“Come!” Luo Tian smiled coldly, continuously striking out with white hands from his palms. Each time he struck, a person was seized from the crowd.

“Hantian Sect… annihilated! Disha Sect… annihilated…” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed repeatedly, and behind him, Gu Lei and Chen Zhanbiao also left toward the transmission array, their faces filled with excitement.

Silence. The golden ancient heavenly palace hovered above Luo Tian’s head, and he gazed at the forces from the Nine Realms standing on the ground with a cold expression.

“I am Luo Tian. I am a disciple of Wuxing Sect and the master of the ancient heavenly palace. Do you have any objections?” Luo Tian stood with his hands behind him, his voice sweeping through the crowd.

“Truly Luo Tian! The ancient heavenly palace is an Epoch treasure. Only the true master can wield it so effortlessly!” As Luo Tian’s words ended, people roared again, their gazes toward him changing.

“Luo Tian, truly alive!” People instantly realized, all faces filled with admiration. They rushed to kneel before him, eyes full of gratitude.

“Luo Tian!” Someone led the crowd in kneeling, their eyes filled with gratitude.

A thunderous cheer erupted across Tianyuan Continent, like a storm of waves. The voices carried strong gratitude and regret—gratitude for Luo Tian’s past deeds in the Nine Realms, and regret for their previous doubts.

“Everyone, I truly haven’t died. I entered the Origin Domain. The Ancient Royal Clan may emerge soon. At that time, it will be a true crisis. Unless the Nine Realms unite, they won’t withstand Origin Domain’s attack. I’m sure you all know the hostility the Ancient Royal Clan holds toward humanity!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze scanning the crowd.

“Those who incited this before—those who tried to provoke you to attack Four Sacred Star Domains and Tianyuan Continent. Should they be killed?” Luo Tian spoke coldly, gazing at the people seized before him—nearly a hundred in total.

“Kill…” A low roar echoed through the crowd. None were foolish; after Luo Tian’s reminder, they had realized and, trusting him, didn’t hesitate.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The hundred people seized before Luo Tian turned into mist of blood, falling from the sky.

“Everyone has seen me. I assume you’ve fulfilled your wish. Please unite in the future, and when the clan arrives, help the Nine Realms through this crisis!”

“I’m sure among your star domains there are those who incited this. I hope you can root them out, preventing interference between Four Sacred Star Domains and each star domain!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, his voice still cold.

“I have one more thing to announce. Three days from now, Four Sacred Star Domains will march on the Underworld and annihilate Feng Clan. I found Feng Clan’s presence in these people’s souls. Also, one of the Nine Saints of the Underworld escaped—Second-ranked Saint of the Underworld, Ming Zhenyan! I suspect Feng Clan has colluded with him!”

“Do you need our help, Luo Lord?” At this point, Luo Tian had become the representative of Four Sacred Star Domains in people’s minds.

“Unexpectedly, Feng Clan is so despicable. They incited us to attack Four Sacred Star Domains. They should be killed!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, people roared again, their gazes deep as they looked toward the Underworld, ready to fight.

“Enough, everyone. My Tianyuan Continent is too small to accommodate so many people. Please return to your sects. As for sweeping the Underworld, Four Sacred Star Domains can handle it alone!” Luo Tian smiled slightly. Regardless of their sincerity, he had never intended for them to help.

“Then we won’t bother you!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, some faces showed regret while others bore relief. After all, Feng Clan wasn’t a Holy Sect but was considered no less than one by many.

“Don’t send us off!” Luo Tian smiled, watching long streaks of light fly out from Tianyuan Continent. His eyes darkened.

“These people!” Seeing each sect depart, those behind Luo Tian sighed deeply.

“Brat! Why did you return so late? If you hadn’t returned, they would’ve torn down Wuxing Sect!” Luo Xiong’s face bore a smile as he approached behind Luo Tian.

With the rise of Jiang Nanxuan and Xu Liyi, Luo Xiong and others had stopped meddling in matters for years. But this incident was too big, so it had drawn them out.

“Some things delayed me!” Luo Tian bowed to Luo Xiong and others, laughing lightly. His gaze turned cold as he looked at Wuxing Sect’s mountain gate, now battered.

This incident clearly had someone behind it. Though Luo Tian hadn’t confirmed it through soul-searching, he found some clues—Feng Clan.

“I’ll see what Feng Clan has left!” Luo Tian sneered, then greeted the people of Four Sacred Star Domains and vanished from the spot.

In a void of Four Sacred Star Domains, a massive warship lay anchored. The ship resembled an immense continent with seven islands connected—originally the Seven Star Islands.

Since the warship returned from Origin Domain to Four Sacred Star Domains, it had remained here without appearing in the Nine Realms. This was the decision of Luo Xiong, Jiang Nanxuan, and Elder Xuanbing.

A ripple spread. Luo Tian’s figure burst into the void, appearing before the warship. Upon arrival, he immediately drew attention from those aboard.

“Luo Tian!” A chorus of exclamations echoed from the ship. Elder Xuanbing, several mid-Epoch elders, and remaining island masters appeared at the ship’s bow, their faces filled with excitement.

“Haha! I knew you were fine!” Yang Jinghua and Shen Gong Feichi laughed, looking at Luo Tian landing on the ship, rushing forward to examine him.

“Sorry for worrying you!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the powerful Seven Star Island people. Now back in the Nine Realms, their strength had improved.

Especially Guan Xingjian, Shen Gong Feichi, Yang Jinghua, and Hu Tianzong had made significant progress, advancing to mid-Epoch.

“Excellent!” Luo Tian gazed at the four with overwhelming auras, his eyes smiling. He secretly marveled that Origin Domain had been suppressed; returning to this world of great changes, everyone’s talent and strength had emerged.

“Kid! You finally thought of us!” Elder Xuanbing smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. His aura radiated an overwhelming presence that made Luo Tian’s heart tremble.

“Epoch Peak!” Luo Tian was stunned. He was currently mid-Epoch; even a late-Epoch level person wouldn’t make him tremble. Clearly, Elder Xuanbing had greatly improved.

Looking at the other elders, their auras were equally formidable, hinting at breakthroughs. This made Luo Tian delighted—such breakthroughs would be a great boon for Four Sacred Star Domains.

Luo Tian’s eyes held joy. He bowed respectfully to Elder Xuanbing: “Congratulations, Master, on reaching Epoch Peak!”

“Fortuitous, but I suppose it’s the end,” Elder Xuanbing shook his head lightly, a wistful look in his eyes.

“Speak up. What’s the matter this time? Can we finally go out? We’ve been stuck in this void for too long!” Yang Jinghua’s eyes gleamed, addressing Luo Tian.

“There is indeed something. I need your help; it’s time to震慑 those people!” Luo Tian chuckled, addressing the group.

Though he didn’t know who was behind this incident, Luo Tian didn’t want it to continue. He had more important matters; thus, he would give these Holy Sects a strong震慑 to ensure his peace of mind while searching for Gu Qianxue and others. The best way was to annihilate a Holy Sect.

Chapter 1400: Annihilation

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Seven Star Island members spoke in unison. Their voices were laced with fierce battle spirit, their faces filled with excitement.

“Thanks,” Luo Tian smiled, bowing to them. Though he had once been a member of Seven Star Island, now representing Four Sacred Star Domains, this was asking for help.

“Little bastard! When did you become so polite? Without you, we wouldn’t have had the chance to return to the Nine Realms. Perhaps we would’ve been annihilated by those three clans!” Long Jing slapped Luo Tian’s back, not minding that he was now a mid-Epoch level power.

“Kill!” A low roar echoed through the void ship. Luo Tian’s conversation with the Seven Star Island members was clearly heard, and all faces were filled with excitement.

“Open!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. Standing on the void ship, he began to activate it. The massive vessel emitted a series of thunderous roars, shaking slightly in the void before instantly appearing within Four Sacred Star Domains.

“This is…”

“…the ship that stormed into Four Sacred Star Domains over a decade ago!” Upon the void ship’s appearance, people of Four Sacred Star Domains erupted in chatter. Yet they soon quieted under Luo Xiong’s安抚.

“Is that Luo Tian!” Soon, people saw Luo Tian standing on the void ship, their faces filled with excitement.

“Everyone, annihilate Feng Clan of the Underworld!” Luo Tian spoke softly. His voice shook the stars, filled with fierce battle spirit echoing through the cosmos.

“Haha! Let’s go!” Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi emerged from the transmission array, their bodies bloodied—evidently having just fought.

“Boom… boom…” They landed on the void ship, their faces filled with excitement.

“Go…” Luo Tian didn’t take too many people. After all, Four Sacred Star Domains were currently in a turbulent period. Only Zheng Xin and others followed.

“Boom…” The massive ship roared as it moved through the black void, instantly vanishing from Four Sacred Star Domains’ sight.

“Finally took action! Luo Tian is truly Luo Tian, causing such a commotion upon his return!” People of Four Sacred Star Domains looked excitedly at the void ship departing, murmuring among themselves.

Luo Tian didn’t choose to traverse space directly but traveled through star domains, making everyone aware of Four Sacred Star Domains’ terrifying strength.

“What is that! A continent?” The void ship, resembling a massive continent, flew through the star domains. Its overwhelming aura caused everyone to be awestruck.

It crashed into lifeless continents, the thunderous sound echoing around the massive ship.

Subsequently, people noticed Luo Tian and Xu Liyi on the ship, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Luo Tian said he would annihilate Feng Clan. Is this heading to the Underworld? But we’re in the Chaos Domain!” Someone from Chaos Domain spoke, their voice trembling. The void ship’s pressure was too great; even the presence of Luo Tian and others on it made most people unable to withstand its pressure.

“My god, is this a Epoch treasure? I feel our entire continent can’t withstand one collision!” Everyone was terrified, watching the massive ancient warship, fearing it might crush their continent unintentionally.

The Nine Realms trembled again with the void ship’s appearance. Everyone marveled at Four Sacred Star Domains’ strength—within just a few decades, it had transformed from the weakest star domain in the Nine Realms to this formidable power—truly bittersweet.

“Is it a震慑?” On the divine mountain of the Divine Clan, Sun Miechen’s eyes flickered. He listened to reports from his people, murmuring softly before sighing deeply.

“Truly capable of causing trouble!” In the Shura Domain, Yan Hongtao smiled slightly, shaking his head in admiration.

The massive ship traversed various star domains for three days before vanishing beneath the star domains and into the void.

“Luo Tian, finally met you. Will you be surprised to see me?” In the Underworld, a youth sat atop a grey mountain.

With news of Luo Tian’s attack on the Underworld, everyone was in chaos. Many forces had already evacuated from the Underworld, fearing collateral damage.

“Damn it! We weren’t prepared yet. He’s already arrived!” In the Feng Clan’s hall, some elders looked grim.

“Don’t panic. A small Luo Tian won’t cause much trouble. With me here, what do we fear?” An elder sat at the head of the table, his face calm yet filled with hatred.

If Luo Tian were here, he would recognize this elder as Ming Zhenyan, one of the Nine Saints who had escaped.

“Hmph. Feng Clan has placed all our hopes on you!” Wind Changming, an elder of the Feng Clan, gazed at Ming Zhenyan seated there and sneered.

“I am now Epoch Peak!” Ming Zhenyan spoke softly, his voice filled with confidence as he surveyed the crowd.

“With my clan’s royal heir present, any prodigy will be suppressed!” Ming Zhenyan spoke again, calming the crowd’s minds.

Epoch Peak—now nonexistent in the Nine Realms. Such a level of cultivation was enough to reassure everyone.

“Boom…” The massive ship broke through the void, descending into the Underworld. Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed across the cosmos.

“Four Sacred Star Domains, approaching the Underworld. Evacuate within a day; otherwise, bear the consequences!” His domineering voice shook the Underworld. Those still hesitating to evacuate no longer doubted, choosing to flee.

The void ship’s pressure was too great. Hearing about it was one thing; seeing it with their own eyes was another.

“Haha! Luo Tian, your boldness is impressive. Why invade our Feng Clan? You killed our Phoenix Patriarch’s heir before, now you’re pressuring us again. Be wise and retreat; otherwise, we’ll settle old and new scores!” A deep voice echoed, equally domineering.

“You were the ones who killed my kin and friends first. You also incited the Nine Realms’ forces to surround Four Sacred Star Domains. If I don’t retaliate, then I’m not Luo Tian!” Luo Tian responded, then fell silent.

“Then fight!” The Feng Clan side replied without speaking further. Both sides knew they were now enemies with no path back.

This was Luo Tian’s first time actively attacking a major force, comparable to a Holy Sect. Though he knew more than just Feng Clan were behind Four Sacred Star Domains’ attacks, he didn’t want to waste time. He chose the most defiant Feng Clan first.

As a day passed, forces continuously evacuated from the Underworld. Yet many of Feng Clan’s long-standing loyal forces remained on their side.

“Crush them!” Luo Tian spoke softly. The massive void ship slowly opened, breaking through the stars like a primordial beast colliding with celestial bodies. It surged toward the heart of the Underworld.

“Boom…” A continent shattered under the void ship’s collision. The Feng Clan’s direct lineage, residing on this continent, perished instantly, their blood staining the void ship.
