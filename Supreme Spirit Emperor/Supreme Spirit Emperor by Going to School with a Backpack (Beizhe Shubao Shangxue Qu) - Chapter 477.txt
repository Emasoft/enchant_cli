“Daredevil! I never expected you to come here yourselves!” The middle-aged man’s face was twisted with madness as his Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage cultivation surged forth, a palm striking toward Long Youran.

“Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage attack!” The crowd watched the flying hand, trembling as their gazes turned to Long Youran in the sky.

“Yuran, Luotian, flee! They’ve gone mad and care nothing for anything. Remember to avenge us!” Long Li shouted at Luotian and Long Youran, knowing their strength. He did not wish for them to be captured too.

“Who dares? You dare kill a disciple of the Tianmen Sect!” Luotian sneered, striking back with a palm. Golden hands surged like mountains and oceans, colliding with the middle-aged man’s hand.

“Boom…!” The next moment, the middle-aged man’s celestial energy hand was shattered by Luotian’s attack, crashing down upon him.

“Even a Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage attack was shattered!” The crowd’s faces bore shock. They had not expected this youth to be so formidable.

“He is Luotian, the one who helped Long Chengzhu unify the Five Cities. Later he joined the Tianmen Sect and holds a certain status within it!” The people soon recognized Luotian, gasping in astonishment.

“Boom…” The golden hand’s power remained undiminished, striking the middle-aged man and sending him flying backward.

“How?” The middle-aged man’s eyes widened in disbelief, stunned by Luotian’s strength.

“Didn’t they say Luotian was only Heavenly Immortal Early Stage?” The middle-aged man’s mind reeled in shock.

“By the heavens! Not only did he block that elder’s attack, but he even shattered it!” The crowd erupted in murmurs.

“A Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage opponent is naught but a commoner before me!” Luotian sneered, his body flickering as he appeared before the middle-aged man and struck again.

“Boom…” The next moment, the middle-aged man’s body was crushed into the ground by Luotian’s palm, lacking any resistance.

“How is this possible!” The middle-aged man’s face turned as pale as paper, blood spewing from his mouth, even fragments of internal organs.

“You’re a Heavenly Immortal Late Stage!” The middle-aged man’s voice trembled, realizing Luotian could not have been helpless if he were only Mid-Stage.

“A Heavenly Immortal Late Stage? I nearly killed one!” Luotian’s face bore coldness as he stomped toward the middle-aged man.

“Boom…” Blood mist surged, and the middle-aged man died beneath Luotian’s feet, causing the onlookers to gasp.

Luotian then turned, his gaze falling upon the remaining Zhenxian Sect disciples, causing them to tremble.

“You… don’t kill me! If you kill us, we’ll kill them!” One disciple stammered, brandishing a long sword toward the kneeling people.

These disciples had been utterly terrified by Luotian, for the man he crushed was none other than Zhenxian Sect’s elder and Yuan Tianjiao’s father.

“Threaten me?” Luotian’s face remained cold, his hand reaching out to extract the middle-aged man’s soul and cast it into the sky’s flames.

“Eight Directions of Lost Treasures!” Luotian waved his hands, invisible waves radiating outward.

“Clang… clang…” Next moment, the Zhenxian Sect disciples’ weapons shook violently.

“What’s happening? What sorcery is this!” The Zhenxian Sect disciples panicked, feeling their weapons pulled by an unseen force.

“Crash…!” Finally, the people could not withstand it; their weapons flew into the air, hovering above them with a chilling glow.

“Luo Tian, let me handle it!” Long Youran’s eyes turned blood-red as her sword flashed with cold light, slicing through a disciple’s head.

“Good!” Luotian nodded. He knew Long Youran had matured, understanding the rules of the Immortal realm—survival of the fittest. From this day forward, she was no longer a naive girl but truly grown.

Cold light flashed as Zhenxian Sect disciples fell to Long Youran’s blade, their blood staining the platform. Long Li and others were also rescued by Luotian.

Massacre, complete massacre. The Zhenxian Sect disciples could not unleash their strength under Luotian’s aura, most being Heavenly Dao Stage. Long Youran felled them with a single strike each, needing two for those at Heavenly Immortal Early Stage.

An hour passed; dozens of Zhenxian Sect disciples lay dead, and the sky’s fiery cage formed a vast prison, souls burning within.

“Alas…” Long Li’s face paled as he watched Long Youran panting heavily, sighing deeply. Though he knew she would eventually face the cruelty of the Immortal realm, his heart ached.

“Senior, it was my fault!” Luotian’s face bore regret. He knew the Zhenxian Sect must have discovered he killed Yuan Tianjiao and traced him to Longyin City.

“I was careless. If I had led people into the Endless Forest, we might have evaded this fate. It was my fault to the city lord’s family of over a thousand people.” Long Li’s face bore pain; the city lord’s household had numbered one thousand and a hundred, now reduced to just over a hundred.

“Blood debts must be repaid with blood! These people died because of me, and I shall ensure they depart in peace!” Luotian’s face bore killing intent as he clenched his hand, the fiery cage collapsing. The souls within were annihilated in a blaze.

Chapter 1844: Annihilation of Zhenxian Sect

Zhenxian Sect, once a glorious power among the Lower Three Heavens, had participated in the War for Heaven, proving its status as a top sect. Yet it fell after losing that war, retreating to the Lower Three Heavens.

The War for Heaven saw Zhenxian Sect’s eight-tenths annihilated by the Central Three Heavens’ forces, leaving only the weak and elderly to return. It plummeted from a top sect, even relocating its mountain fortress.

Night fell as Luotian appeared above Zhenxian Sect’s sky, his face cold, a barrier enveloping the sect’s vast mountain.

“Truly fallen! Zhenxian Sect is no larger than Tianmen Sect’s mountain!” Luotian waved his hand, seven-colored fire dragons leaping forth to illuminate the darkness. Serpentine fire dragons circled in the sky.

“What is that!” At the sight of the fire dragons, Zhenxian Sect disciples immediately sensed it. One by one, they emerged from their quarters, faces filled with confusion.

“Eight Directions of Celestial Fire!” Luotian’s face bore coldness, ignoring the terrified disciples. He struck his palm into the void.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Next moment, Zhenxian Sect’s doom descended. Flames surged, instantly engulfing the entire Zhenxian Mountain. The massive barrier could not withstand the seven-colored flames.

The terror of celestial fire was now fully revealed; Zhenxian Mountain ignited instantly, any touch of a spark igniting immediately.

“Ah…” A scream echoed as all below Heavenly Dao Stage, including those at Heavenly Dao, were killed eight-tenths. The remaining struggled desperately, while Heavenly Immortal Stage disciples howled in agony.

“Who are you? Why have you attacked Zhenxian Sect!” The disciples’ faces bore resentment, their bodies annihilated by the flames.

“Who are you!” As the fire rose, voices of anger echoed from Zhenxian Sect. A group of figures flew out.

“Celestial fire! The seven-colored celestial fire! Young man, stop!” Next moment, an elder at Heavenly Immortal Late Stage rushed toward Luotian. Behind him followed seven disciples at Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage, all furious.

“Blame it on your mistake for attacking those near me!” Luotian’s face bore killing intent. Seeing only one Heavenly Immortal Late Stage elder and several Mid-Stage disciples, his brows furrowed. He whispered lowly before dashing toward the elder.

“Crack…” The sky resounded with fierce collisions as Luotian’s body flickered, battling eight elders alone.

“Young man, you are too arrogant!” The Heavenly Immortal Late Stage elder’s face bore coldness. His body was pushed back by Luotian’s punch, but his mind reeled in shock at the youth’s origin.

“Arrogant?” Luotian paused, his left hand summoning the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map while his right hand unleashed the Intercept Heaven Seal. The collision shattered seven Mid-Stage disciples, who coughed blood.

“Kingdom War Technique!” Luotian roared, the technique activating as he vanished again to clash with the Heavenly Immortal Late Stage elder.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Thunderous collisions echoed beneath the dark sky, as disciples who escaped the flames watched in awe.

“Who is this youth? How can he battle the sect’s master and seven elders at Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage, even seemingly gaining the upper hand!” Zhenxian Sect disciples gasped.

“Could he be a disciple of one of the three major sects? But even then, this strength is absurd!” The people marveled. Even the collision’s waves made them tremble.

Luotian laughed, his battle power fully unleashed with numerous techniques. His peak-level cultivation rivaled a Heavenly Immortal Late Stage. Golden-black elixirs whirred in his dantian, their澎湃仙气 filling his body. He resembled a god descending from heaven, clashing with the elder while pressuring the seven Mid-Stage elders.

“Who are you? Why do you oppose Zhenxian Sect!” The elder clashed with Luotian, but found himself powerless against him.

“Luotian!” Luotian announced loudly, unleashing the蛮七踏 (Fierce Seven Steps), his golden foot instantly killing a Mid-Stage disciple.

“Luotian!” The elder’s face changed upon hearing the name, recalling the prodigy Luotian from Tianmen Sect who had slain Yuan Tianjiao.

“Indeed!” Luotian laughed, piercing a Mid-Stage elder’s heart with his spear while enduring five more disciples’ attacks.

“Show your strongest attack! Otherwise, I shall annihilate Zhenxian Sect today!” Luotian roared, retreating before summoning three-headed dogs.

“Roar…” The three-headed dogs bellowed, their massive heads exhaling heaven and earth. Three attacks instantly enveloped the remaining five Mid-Stage elders.

“Ah…” The elders struggled desperately, their eyes unfocused as they turned on each other.

“Illusion!” The Zhenxian Sect’s master, Yuan Hongming, his face contorted in shock. His eyes momentarily lost focus before breaking free from the illusion, struck by a black lightning bolt.

“Has the power of the彼岸花 (Biyanghua) been acquired by Xiaohei?” Luotian’s face bore joy, gazing at the mighty three-headed dogs. He had not expected them to have absorbed Biyanghua, advancing to Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage and mastering its powerful illusion ability.

“Now no one will disturb us!” Luotian flickered toward the Zhenxian Sect master.

“Damn it!” Yuan Hongming’s face darkened, his expression twisted: “Killing my sect’s prodigy and now attacking Zhenxian Sect? Do you think we are easy prey!”

“We were once the dominant sect of the Lower Three Heavens. How dare you act so recklessly here!” Yuan Hongming’s hands moved, drawing a character in the air.

“Bing…” The sound of ten thousand soldiers’ battle cries echoed across heaven and earth, the character “Bing” (Army) crushing down upon Luotian—Zhenxian’s Eight Techniques, first form.

“Zhenxian’s Eight Techniques?” Luotian’s eyes brightened, his hands forming a seal to unleash the Intercept Heaven Seal against the descending “Bing” character.

“Boom…!” The thunderous collision echoed, the Intercept Heaven Seal clashing with the “Bing” character.

“Lin!” Seeing Luotian neutralize his “Bing” technique, Yuan Hongming showed no surprise. After all, Luotian’s strength had already been proven.

“Fierce God’s Wrath, Seven Steps to Heaven!” Luotian roared, unleashing the Fierce Seven Steps. His golden foot clashed with the “Lin” character.

“Remember, your killer is Zhenxian Sect’s master, Yuan Hongming! To die under Zhenxian’s Eight Techniques is your honor!”

“Dou!” Yuan Hongming chanted again, a golden “Dou” (Battle) character flying from his hands, crushing down upon Luotian.

“Wum…” Waves rippled around the golden “Dou” character, a powerful pressure making Luotian’s eyes narrow. His eyes turned purple as he discerned the “Dou” technique’s carving.

“The third form, indeed worth the journey!” Luotian muttered lowly before launching his second and third Fierce Seven Steps, both striking the awe-inspiring “Dou” technique.

“Boom… boom…” The sky resounded with titanic collisions, and Luotian’s mouth bled slightly.

“An impressive technique!” Luotian’s face paled, yet his eyes gleamed with excitement.

“Even the third form of Zhenxian’s Eight Techniques! It rivals a middle-tier immortal-grade power!” Yuan Hongming’s face bore disbelief.

“But the next form, you will not withstand it!” Yuan Hongming’s face twisted with madness. The fourth form was his limit, its power rivaling high-tier immortal-grade—even a Heavenly Immortal peak would perish.

“Zhe!” Yuan Hongming chanted, the sound echoing across heaven and earth as a powerful pressure coalesced in his hands.

“This is Zhenxian’s Fourth Form! That kid is doomed! Everyone, move away to avoid being caught!” Zhenxian Sect disciples cried out, their eyes wild with excitement as they watched Yuan Hongming’s slow movements.

“Rule Power!” Luotian’s eyes locked onto the “Zhe” character凝聚 (coalesced) above Yuan Hongming, his eyes shifting.

“Go!” Yuan Hongming roared, his pale face pushing the “Zhe” character down toward Luotian.

“Fierce God’s Seven Steps Shatter Eternity!” Luotian roared, his seventh step landing while a black御鬼印 (Ghost-Controlling Seal) flew from his hands, colliding with the golden “Zhe” character.

A deafening explosion erupted, shaking the ruined Zhenxian Mountain violently. The wild waves instantly engulfed Luotian.

“That kid is surely dead!” Yuan Hongming sighed, unable to fathom any chance of survival for Luotian amidst such a surge.

“Wum…” As Yuan Hongming sighed, preparing to deal with the three-headed dogs, a sudden sense of crisis pierced his mind, causing his face to twist in shock.

A black demon seal burst forth from the surging energy, instantly appearing behind Yuan Hongming and smashing into his back.

“Boom…” The black demon seal exploded, releasing a torrent of ghostly qi that enveloped heaven and earth, as if countless demons had been unleashed.

Chapter 1846: Journey to Luantian Sect

The golden book returned to Luotian’s mind, his pale face standing amidst the void.

Golden light faded; Zhenxian Mountain vanished, and the entire sect seemed erased entirely, leaving no trace. No life remained, stretching for miles, becoming a dead land.

“Truly terrifying the Chronological Book!” Luotian’s face was grim, yet his heart thrilled. Though the book nearly drained him, it revealed its immense power.

Though he knew the Chronological Book was strong, it had always acted on its own whimsy. Now, he could wield it, making it a decisive move.

“Even an Immortal might not withstand it!” Luotian’s face gleamed with divine light, thinking of what would happen if he ascended to Immortal or even Emperor level and unleashed the Chronological Book.

……

Upper Three Heavens

On Eternal Mountain, Eternal Immortal King’s eyes flickered as he held a golden paper that seemed to break free.

“Someone has activated the Chronological Book!” Eternal Immortal King muttered, his eyes deep.

“These fools took so long to find these few—perhaps I must go myself!” Eternal Immortal King’s face bore coldness. His aura surged, and a second Eternal Immortal King appeared before him.

“A third of my power in this form, I should be able to reach the Central Three Heavens!” The two Eternal Immortal Kings spoke simultaneously. The one with a peak immortal aura vanished from Eternal Mountain.

At the same time, other immortal mountains also had streaks of light flashing away.

……

“What?” Luotian furrowed his brows, gazing at the ground annihilated by the Chronological Book. He found a half-zhang-long gray stick on the ground.

“Not destroyed by such an attack—this stick is no ordinary thing!” Luotian flew toward the gray stick.

He reached out, a cold sensation spreading through his perception.

“Primordial Chaos Tree’s branch!” He realized the tree’s nature—part of an immortal herb, refined with supreme methods.

“There are characters!” He felt the stick’s patterns—small characters.

“Zhenxian’s Eight Techniques, I created them while intoxicated in calligraphy. Accurately, it should be nine forms, but I never reached the ninth.”

“Zhenxian’s Eight Techniques is my life's work. I carved this technique onto the Primordial Chaos Wood, refining it into Zhenxian’s Brush. I hope a worthy person will carry forward my technique! Calligraphy Immortal, Biyanghua!” Luotian’s hands moved across the gray stick, and the characters gradually appeared in his mind.

“Calligraphy Immortal!” Luotian furrowed his brows, then his eyes flashed with divine light.

“The top of all under Immortal!” He spoke aloud, recalling the introduction of the Upper Three Heavens he had seen in Tianmen Sect. He had heard of this great immortal before.

He had heard of him because the Calligraphy Immortal was from the Lower Three Heavens. No one knew of his existence until he single-handedly killed into the Nine Immortal Mountains, Ghost King Mountain, to save his wife.

Legend said he was once a scholar, an ordinary man. His wife was kind, but Ghost King Sect’s forces in the Lower Three Heavens sought to strengthen themselves through ruthless slaughter, constantly massacring cities. The Calligraphy Immortal had avoided this by going to take exams but his wife was killed by Ghost King Sect, becoming a ghost and entering the sect.

Upon hearing this news, he spat blood and fell into a coma for three days. Upon waking, he abandoned writing to pursue martial arts, eventually becoming a peak immortal. He single-handedly attacked Ghost King Mountain, killing it with his brush and sword.

That battle saw him kill the mountain’s corpses in blood, and if not for Ghost King Mountain’s Immortal appearing, he could have annihilated the entire mountain.

Even when the Immortal appeared, it changed nothing; he fought for a day and night, leaving the Ghost King Mountain’s Immortal helpless. Finally, they compromised, allowing him to take his wife’s ghostly form away, establishing his reputation as the top under Immortal.

Yet after that battle, he was severely wounded. He returned to the Lower Three Heavens with his wife but died within a century, leaving behind Zhenxian’s Brush, which was obtained by Zhenxian Sect’s first master. Thus, the Lower Three Heavens’ renowned sect was born.

“Truly admirable elder!” Luotian muttered, his eyes filled with reverence. Such a figure deserved his respect.

“The top under Immortal! Making the Ghost King Mountain’s Immortal bow!” Luotian thought of that scene, his long-dormant热血 (blood) ignited.

“The Calligraphy Immortal made the high-ranking Immortal bow—so I shall attack Eternal Mountain and revive my Dao Sect!” Luotian muttered, his hands slowly moving.

Not long after, he fully mastered the first eight forms, a smile on his face.

“At my current strength, I can only perform the first four!” He realized his limits and glanced at the gray stick.

“Not complete?” Luotian reached out, retrieving the true Zhenxian Brush’s handle, a smile on his face.

“Back!” Luotian was satisfied and sat atop the three-headed dogs, for he was also weak.

“Roar…” The three-headed dogs bellowed, transforming into a black light and flying toward Longyin City.

“Zhenxian Sect was annihilated!” Only when Luotian had left did people from nearby cities arrive, their faces filled with shock.

“Completely erased, as if it never existed!” The people marveled.

“Who is that youth? How could he annihilate Zhenxian Sect’s entire sect alone!” They soon recalled the youth with three-headed dogs they had seen on the road.

Soon, news of Zhenxian Sect’s annihilation spread, along with the youth riding a three-headed dog.

“Alright, Long Lord, I’ll see you off here. If there’s anything, come to Tianmen Sect for me!” Luotian smiled as he and Long Youran exited Longyin City.

“Luo Elder, thank you for this time! If you have time, return to visit!” Long Li’s face bore gratitude. Without Luotian, they would have been in danger. He had also heard of Zhenxian Sect being annihilated by a youth riding three-headed dogs.

“Farewell!” Luotian bowed to Long Li, having recovered after two days in Zhenxian Sect. He then proposed leaving, as there were many matters at Luantian Sect. He feared delay would bring trouble.

“I won’t see you off. I entrust Youran to you!” Long Li spoke softly, watching Luotian and Long Youran mount the three-headed dogs.

“Roar…” The three-headed dogs bellowed, taking flight under the people of Tianlong City’s reverent gazes toward Luantian Sect.

“This harvest was truly significant! Luantian Sect, if you make any moves, don’t blame me for ruining your plans!” Luotian’s face bore coldness. He knew entering Luantian Sect would not be easy, but he had no choice.

“Youran, when we near Luantian Sect, don’t follow me—go back alone!” Wind howled in their ears as Luotian spoke.

“Hm.” Long Youran nodded, knowing that Luotian had a grudge with Yao Qishui. At times, she might become a burden, and Tianmen Sect disciples’ status could not restrain Luantian Sect. After all, Luantian Sect was a renowned sect in the Lower Three Heavens.

Time passed slowly; the three-headed dogs now at Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage, their speed much faster. In four days, they reached the destination—Luantian City.

Luantian City was like Tianlong City and Luantian Sect’s relationship, an independent force of Luantian Sect. Luotian and Long Youran found a hotel to stay.

“Luo Tian, let’s take a walk before going!” Long Youran pulled Luotian out of the hotel. She knew if he went, it might be dangerous and he had no guarantee; otherwise, he wouldn’t have sent her to Luantian City.

“Alright, I’ll walk with you!” Luotian smiled, secretly sighing: “If it’s a good idea to familiarize the roads, it would be useful!”

“Let’s go!” Luotian led Long Youran out of the hotel, walking through Luantian City’s streets.

The city was lively, naturally not poor since it was a major sect.

They walked the streets without anything particularly catching their attention, as Tianmen Sect’s outer market was better than this city’s streets.

“Luo Tian, look there!” Suddenly, Long Youran seemed to find something interesting and pulled Luotian toward a crowd.

“Gambling Stone Shop!” Three big characters appeared in their view, making Luotian’s face light up. He had never gambled much, as ten out of ten bets were losers.

Gambling stones—simple in concept: gamblers bought stones, cut them open to see what was inside. If they found something good, they won; if not, they had to accept their loss.

“Come on! Look here! See this top-tier meteorite stone, only three thousand immortal stones!” Voices of salesmen echoed constantly. Luotian was uninterested; the so-called meteorite stone was just an old rock, and his spiritual sense revealed it contained only a small immortal stone. Extracted, it was worth hundreds of immortal stones, not worth the price.

Chapter 1847: Broken Dragon Stone

“Wum…” As Luotian and Long Youran strolled, waves of energy surged from the gambling stone shop’s depths, making Luotian frown. Celestial qi floated, instantly enveloping the entire shop.

“Someone has opened an immortal crystal! As big as a fist!” The people gasped, rushing toward the shop’s depths.

“Immortal crystal?” Luotian’s eyes brightened, surprised to find one here.

Immortal stones were the currency of the Immortal realm, as they contained celestial qi to aid cultivation. Immortal crystals were a higher grade, representing preciousness. While immortal stones had sparse and mixed qi, immortal crystals contained pure celestial qi. A fingernail-sized crystal could rival hundreds of immortal stones.

A fist-sized immortal crystal was worth tens of thousands of immortal stones, and it was priceless—too rare to be sold.

“Who opened the immortal crystal!” Luotian and Long Youran also approached the shop’s depths.

The crowd soon reached the shop’s inner sanctum, a place where stones were more expensive and of higher quality than outside stalls.

“Yin Tiandao!” The people soon saw a middle-aged man holding an exquisite immortal crystal.

“Unexpectedly, Yin Tiandao has been here for a year, nearly bankrupting himself. Now he’s finally opened something good! With this crystal, Yin Tiandao can recover his losses and even multiply them!” The people murmured.

The middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with excitement, his ragged robe and beard revealing a man who had struggled. He held an immense celestial qi-filled fist-sized immortal crystal, his cultivation at Heavenly Immortal Early Stage.

Some people envied him, others coveted greedily, and some glared with hostility toward Yin Tiandao.

“I’ll offer three thousand immortal stones! Yin Tiandao, sell it to me!” A man emerged from the crowd, addressing Yin Tiandao.

“Three thousand? I’ll offer five!” Before his voice faded, several voices shouted loudly,竞价 (bidding) until the crystal’s price reached ten thousand immortal stones.

“Ten thousand…” Luotian sighed, knowing he had only that many immortal crystals—collected from Tianmen Sect’s alchemy and looted along the way.

“It’s too expensive, I can’t afford it!” Luotian shook his head lightly. He could sense Long Youran was about to reach Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage. With this crystal and the Wujiji Dan, she would definitely ascend to Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage.

“I won’t sell!” Yin Tiandao softly declined, shaking his head. A crystal this large was enough for him to obtain much; ten thousand immortal stones were a bit too costly.

“Don’t you know the rules of the gambling stone shop?” A cold voice echoed in the crowd, followed by a flash of light. A middle-aged man in green robes soared into the air toward Yin Tiandao, his aura radiating strength.

“Die!” Yin Tiandao sneered, ignoring the man and looking at him like a fool.

“Who is this? Doesn’t he know the gambling stone shop’s rules?” The people gasped, surprised no one had acted within the shop.

“Those who disturb the gambling stone shop are dead!” A cold voice echoed in their ears, and a senior appeared before Yin Tiandao, striking him with one palm.

“Boom…” The man who attacked Yin Tiandao was struck by the senior’s palm, his body slowly disintegrating like porcelain, turning into blood mist on the ground.

“Heavenly Immortal Late Stage!” Luotian frowned, gazing at the senior with Heavenly Immortal Late Stage aura.

“Thank you for your intervention, Senior!” Yin Tiandao bowed respectfully to the senior.

“Unexpectedly, it has awakened the gambling stone shop’s Senior, Fang Zhengyang!” The people gasped, their faces filled with reverence toward the senior.

“This gambling stone shop is no ordinary place!” Luotian muttered, a housekeeper with Heavenly Immortal Late Stage power—comparable to Tianmen Sect’s eight elders.

“I’ll restate: no disturbances in the gambling stone shop; disturb and die!” Fang Zhengyang’s face bore coldness, his aura pressing outward.

“Yin Tiandao, can I buy this immortal crystal for fifteen thousand immortal stones?” Fang Zhengyang finished, then gazed at Yin Tiandao with a smile.

“I won’t sell!” Yin Tiandao shook his head, fifteen thousand immortal stones was a high price, even exceeding the crystal’s value.

“Such an impudent fool!” The people heard Yin Tiandao’s refusal, their faces showing disdain. Even Luotian was slightly surprised but it passed quickly.

“Good!” Fang Zhengyang nodded lightly, not continuing to speak before turning away. After all, such a large crystal was precious but in his view, it was merely valuable.

“Senior, wait!” Just as Fang Zhengyang turned away, Yin Tiandao spoke up, stopping him.

“!” Fang Zhengyang’s eyes bore confusion as he gazed at Yin Tiandao.

“For a year, I’ve spent five thousand immortal stones in this gambling stone shop.”

“But I have no regrets. This crystal, I can give to the gambling stone shop, but I have one request!” Yin Tiandao spoke softly, gazing at Fang Zhengyang.

“!”

“I wish to join the gambling stone shop!” Yin Tiandao shouted, his eyes resolute toward Fang Zhengyang.

“Wow…” The people gasped, surprised Yin Tiandao would give up such a treasure to stay in the gambling stone shop.

“Smart fellow!” Luotian smiled, gazing at Yin Tiandao with admiration.

“Luo Tian, why did he do this? That’s fifteen thousand immortal stones!” Long Youran asked with confusion.

“If he carries the crystal, it would surely draw fire. Look at everyone’s eyes—though the gambling stone shop can protect Yin Tiandao, he cannot stay forever. Otherwise, he would become a target. At Heavenly Immortal Early Stage, he couldn’t withstand it!”

“Moreover, the gambling stone shop is clearly no ordinary place. If he stays here, his fortune would be greater!” Luotian explained to Long Youran’s confused gaze.

“Wish to join us?” Fang Zhengyang furrowed his brows, pondering before nodding. He took the crystal from Yin Tiandao and accepted his request.

“Start as a stone cutter. If you do well, I might reward you. You know, joining us requires more than this crystal!” Fang Zhengyang spoke softly before leaving.

“Yes, I will do my best!” Yin Tiandao’s face bore joy as he stood behind Fang Zhengyang.

The people, seeing no entertainment, dispersed, surprised at the outcome.

“What’s this stone worth?” As people scattered, Luotian stood before a one-person-high stone, his face puzzled as he asked Fang Zhengyang.

This stone felt strange to him; even with his spiritual sense, it was impenetrable. He could sense a powerful power within.

“Broken Dragon Stone!” Someone saw the stone’s edge and gasped in disbelief.

“Someone wants to buy the Broken Dragon Stone!” The people marveled, gazing at Luotian.

“Kid, you want to buy the Broken Dragon Stone?” Fang Zhengyang’s eyes flickered with a smile.
