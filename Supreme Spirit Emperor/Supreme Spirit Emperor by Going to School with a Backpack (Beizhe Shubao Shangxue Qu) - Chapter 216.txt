“Gururu…” The golden sacred blood boiled as if ignited by emerald flames, spreading slowly and gradually forming a human-shaped illusion that stood steadily in the darkness.

The shadow coalesced into substance. Luo Tian’s face bore a look of bewilderment, then relief. He clenched his fists slowly and patted his pale face devoid of any color.

“Cough…” He coughed lightly, the sound echoing far through space, causing Luo Tian to exhale long and deep.

“Just a little more, and I wouldn’t have made it!” Luo Tian muttered lowly, his eyes showing a bitter expression. Though he had survived, his current state was at its worst.

The ocean of sacred power in his dantian had vanished completely, returning to a lake-like state. His sacred energy was utterly depleted. Though his body had recovered, it wasn’t as strong as before; his blood qi was no longer vigorous. It was clear he had injured his fundamental essence.

“Half a saint, and yet I’ve wounded my core. When will I recover to the initial stage of a saint?” Luo Tian sighed, smiling bitterly. He hadn’t been so severely wounded in a long time. Yet he was still shaken; he could feel that after his self-destruction, he had nearly perished. If it weren’t for the Jade Crystal Lapis Fire preserving his last drop of essence, Luo Tian might have died.

“At least I’m alive!” Luo Tian chuckled, taking a step forward into the golden door.

Chapter 958: Encirclement

Within the ancient celestial palace, in a vast hall, hundreds of figures stood. All radiated formidable power; some appeared weary but their eyes gleamed with intensity, gazing at the golden bell suspended like a blazing sun above.

A ten-zhang-high bell radiated gold, its intricate patterns dazzling the eye. Golden inscriptions flowed across its surface. Though all knew it was ancient, no signs of age marred it—eternal.

“Pseudo Era Treasure!” Figures appeared in the hall, their faces marked with awe as they beheld the bell.

“A Pseudo Era Treasure! A core artifact of our sect!” Xu Liyi’s face bore admiration, his gaze fixed on the bell. His expression held both awe and greed.

“Big brother, I’ll go help you bring it down!” Chen Zhanbiao’s face bore a foolish grin as he pushed off the ground toward the golden bell.

Before Chen Zhanbiao could take flight, Xu Liyi smacked him down with a palm. “Stay put! Do you think we can touch it? If you get near the bell, they’ll kill you before you even reach it!”

“Haha, you two arrived early!” Diao Dezhu smiled as he stepped forward from the crowd, addressing Xu Liyi.

At the same time, Tian Luo, Long Jie, Lu Han Tian, and Du Hongtao joined Xu Liyi’s group.

“Where is Luo Tian? He should have emerged first—he’s the strongest among us!” Tian Luo smiled, addressing them.

“This fool always arrives late,” Xiu said coldly, his voice low.

Hearing this, Nan Gong Yuqing and others nodded in agreement. Indeed, it was true.

The fluctuations continued until people gathered in groups on the hall’s floor. The divine clan members cast cold glances at Diao Dezhu’s group, their eyes flickering with a hint of killing intent. Yet they held back; Luo Tian’s strength was formidable, and Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian were also initial-stage saints. If a fight broke out, the divine clan would face retaliation.

The demon clan and the beast domain’s people also wore cold expressions, scanning Diao Dezhu’s group. Yet they held back, unwilling to let other factions profit.

Only the thunder domain showed no interest in Diao Dezhu’s group. Their strength was roughly equal, even slightly inferior. They dared not provoke Diao Dezhu’s group and prayed others wouldn’t destroy them.

Everyone knew the bell was a Pseudo Era Treasure, yet no one dared move. Whoever moved first would be obliterated by the others.

“Diao Dezhu, why hasn’t Luo Tian emerged yet? Did he die in the first trial?” Feng Jiutian, accompanied by his clan’s warriors, stepped forward from the crowd. His face bore mockery.

“Feng Jiutian, if you want to fight, I’m ready!” Diao Dezhu was unyielding, giving no ground. Their feud had long been bitter.

“Fight? Not now. Let you gloat a while,” Feng Jiutian smiled, waiting for Luo Tian’s emergence to humiliate him. Diao Dezhu couldn’t act immediately; with Diao Yuanshan present, Feng Jiutian knew the clan’s elders had said Diao Yuanshan was now the beast domain’s strongest, a half-Era saint. If he killed Diao Dezhu here, who could say if Diao Yuanshan would suspect him? Luo Tian wouldn’t be a problem, as he wasn’t from the beast domain. Killing him would be easy.

“Gong…” Luo Tian’s pale figure appeared in the hall, his body weakened. Upon arrival, he saw the golden bell above and his face changed. Then realizing the dense crowd, he understood.

“Luo Tian…” Upon seeing Luo Tian’s figure, Diao Dezhu and others noticed his pale face. Their expressions changed.

“What’s wrong?” They asked, expecting only the first trial to have wounded him. But upon discovering his half-saint status, their faces darkened.

“Brother, what did you come for? Was the first trial that hard?” Diao Dezhu asked, puzzled. He had encountered a soul fragment before—strong but only half-saints. It was challenging, but not enough to wound him severely. Others frowned.

“Why are you all okay?” Luo Tian saw they were unharmed, his heart eased. Yet he sighed inwardly: “Try fighting ninety-nine at once!”

“Haha, a half-saint! This kid came via self-destruction. I finally know what that powerful fluctuation was—your self-destruction, hah!” Feng Jiutian’s face lit up with joy. This was the first time he had been so excited in days.

Before Luo Tian could respond, the demon clan’s saint heir approached him with a smile, his eyes playful.

“Demon clan?” Luo Tian frowned slightly at the black-cloaked youth—Demonic Saint Heir Nan Gong Feibai.

Since entering the beast domain, Luo Tian and the demon clan had been at odds. Though the demon clan bore deep enmity with Nan Gong Yuqing, they had remained peaceful until entering the ancient celestial palace.

“Haha, you really thought we didn’t know? That’s the demon clan’s traitor Nan Gong Yuqing! And Wan Lingkong, that ungrateful fool who refused our clan’s recruitment three times and aided this traitor.”

“Who’s the traitor?” Nan Gong Yuqing’s face darkened as he stepped out from behind Luo Tian, his eyes filled with killing intent. His blood-red sword was in hand, ready to end Nan Gong Feibai’s life if he spoke another word.

“Haha, this is quite a spectacle!” Sun Feiwen of the divine clan stood behind Sun Mengru, smiling as he joined the crowd.

Sun Mengru’s face was cold. She stood at the forefront of the divine clan, her gaze fixed on Luo Tian as she spoke coldly: “Come with me to the divine clan and apologize.”

Luo Tian’s eyes never left Sun Mengru. His brows furrowed slightly; though she seemed haughty, there was no killing intent in her. Her tone suggested she merely wanted to chastise him.

“Some things, even through reincarnation, cannot change. It’s the essence hidden in one’s soul!” Luo Tian mused, a smile on his face. He didn’t look at anyone else but Sun Mengru.

“I’ll go to the divine clan, but one day I’ll take you back from it and help you find your true self!” Luo Tian’s eyes were resolute. Though his face was pale and voice weak, it struck Sun Mengru like thunder, stirring her emotions.

“You know me?” Sun Mengru’s face bore a hint of confusion but her voice remained icy, making Luo Tian uncomfortable.

“Know? More than that. You were…” Diao Dezhu had heard from Gu Lei about Luo Tian and Chen Yuting’s relationship. His big mouth almost spoke, but Luo Tian stopped him.

Luo Tian knew their relationship couldn’t be revealed. If it reached the divine clan, Chen Yuting might suffer.

“Haha, kid, you were so bold in the beast domain. Now let’s see how you’ll get out of this!” Feng Jiutian mocked Luo Tian.

The demon and divine clans also stirred with intent, surrounding Luo Tian’s group. Their auras were fierce, drawing everyone’s attention.

“Luo Tian! He was so renowned in the beast domain. Now he’s surrounded!”
“No choice but to let him face it all,” people murmured, watching the three factions.

“Are you trying to attack us?” Luo Tian’s pale face bore a smile, his mockery evident.

“You all think you’re so self-assured. Why use an ambush? Are you sure you can devour us?” Before the three factions spoke, Luo Tian continued, his voice confident. His gaze swept over them as his aura rose.

The three factions trembled; Luo Tian’s aura had震慑ed them. His past victories were too impressive—Li Xingteng had fallen to him.

“Haha, this is your three factions’ prodigies? All so shameless!” Diao Dezhu was fearless, knowing no one dared touch him in the beast domain.

Behind Luo Tian, Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing also bore killing intent, their gazes mocking the three factions.

“You’re looking for death! Today, no matter what you say, we won’t attack. But are you brave enough to face me in a one-on-one duel?” Feng Jiutian laughed, challenging Luo Tian.

“You’re not even worth it! I can finish you with one hand!” Long Jie’s body shimmered with golden light, his dragon qi radiating as he stepped forward.

“Haha, Luo Tian, you rely on a child to stand out? Where’s your former boldness?” Sun Feiwen sneered, addressing Luo Tian.

“Gong…” As Sun Feiwen’s words ended, a heavy sound echoed. The golden bell above the hall trembled, its thunderous chime reverberating through the chamber.

Chapter 959: Era Bell

Within the ancient celestial palace, Luo Tian’s group was surrounded by three factions. Battle seemed imminent when the golden bell trembled on its own, its chime echoing through the hall. People looked up at the golden bell suspended above.

A heavy pressure silenced the tense atmosphere, their gazes turning to the terrifying golden bell in the sky.

The bell’s chime echoed, as if initiating a sacred ritual. A solemn feeling arose in people's hearts.

Golden light coalesced into a figure, forming an old man under cautious glances.

“Welcome to the ancient celestial palace and partake in this era’s greatest trial! Passing the first stage proves your talent. In any place, you’d be a prodigy.” The old man spoke, his voice carrying endless沧桑. People felt a shiver.

“This era’s greatest trial?” Luo Tian tensed, unsure of the old man’s meaning. Yet he sensed this trial was no ordinary one—otherwise, few had ever left the ancient celestial palace.

“Enough talk. I am your trial guide for this stage. No deaths here; I dislike killing, so you must not fight among yourselves! This is my warning. I am the master of this stage; if you displease me, I’ll destroy you!” The old man’s words were calm but serious. People gasped.

Especially Feng Jiutian, Sun Feiwen, and Nan Gong Feibai’s faces changed. They knew this stage wouldn’t kill Luo Tian.

“Hmph, let him live a while longer. He’s just a broken waste!” Sun Feiwen sneered, coldly speaking.

“You said who was the waste? If my brother hadn’t been injured, would you dare say that?” Long Jie’s anger was palpable. His cold gaze met Sun Feiwen’s, his aura overwhelming.

“Enough!” Luo Tian lightly patted Long Jie’s shoulder and stepped to the center of the crowd. His gaze swept over the three factions, a smile on his face.

“Who’s the waste? Everyone knows. Even now as a half-saint, I could kill you all—saint heirs, divine heirs, and clan leaders.不信? Try it!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold but carried infinite killing intent. He had long wanted to eliminate these people in the ancient celestial palace.

“Haha, bold words. I’ll make you regret saying that when we reach the next level!” Sun Feiwen sneered, believing Luo Tian was at his weakest.

“Hmph. This trial’s goal is to see who can ring the Era Bell. The one who rings it most will have a chance at the Era Bell. I’ll only say it’s a chance; to truly obtain it, you must gain the Era Bell’s approval.” The old man’s face bore annoyance. He glanced at them, sneered, and continued.

“Ring the Era Bell. First, you must reach its front! Strive, remember my words—I dislike killing!” The old man spoke and vanished, leaving people in stunned silence.

“Difficult? It’s just reaching the Era Bell! What’s hard about that? Even I could get there in a few breaths!” A transcendent-level hermit looked puzzled, his aura rising as he flew toward the golden Era Bell.

But in an instant, a massive pressure crushed him. He plummeted into the golden ground, his body bloodied and weak.

“This…” People were stunned, watching the cracked earth and the wounded hermit.

“Indeed difficult!” Luo Tian sighed lowly. Though he knew approaching the bell would be hard, he hadn’t expected it to be this severe—only a few dozen feet away and even a transcendent-level expert couldn’t withstand it.

Luo Tian estimated the Era Bell was at least a thousand feet away. For anyone beyond the supreme realm, it wasn’t far—but to them, it felt like a chasm.

“Hmph! A waste!” The divine clan’s people sneered, their eyes filled with greed. They flew toward the bell like streaks of light.

The divine clan was much stronger than hermits. Their faces bore disdain as they ascended into the sky, but their eyes were wary. After flying three hundred feet, their speed slowed.

Others also moved, thousands of figures streaking toward the golden Era Bell. It was a pseudo-Era Treasure—worth dying for. Plus, the transcendent-level expert had been wounded but wasn’t dead.

The demon clan’s figures radiated black qi, like a dark cloud. They ascended behind the divine clan.

The beast domain’s eight great clans did the same, their faces filled with excitement as they streaked forward, surpassing hermits.

Meanwhile, the Starfield Domain’s people smiled, their figures like meteors flying toward the Era Bell.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian grabbed a handful of pills, swallowed them, and gazed at the Era Bell. Even he was tempted by this pseudo-Era Treasure.

With a step, he transformed into a golden dragon. Though wounded, his speed surpassed most hermits.

The first three hundred feet were quick for everyone. Though the pressure was strong, it wasn’t impossible.

But within three hundred feet, many fell from the sky—like a watershed. All transcendent-level experts failed to pass three hundred feet, even Xiu and Tian Luo. Luo Tian quickly saved them; otherwise, they would have suffered serious injuries.

To Luo Tian’s surprise, Chen Zhanbiao, with his nine-source transcendent-level power, was the weakest in the ancient celestial palace. Yet he passed three hundred feet without difficulty.

“This kid is really strange!” Those who fell also noticed Chen Zhanbiao’s anomaly, their faces puzzled. They hadn’t even matched a nine-source transcendent.

After passing three hundred feet, the sky had fewer people—only about a hundred. Their strength was all half-saints or initial-stage saints, but their speeds varied. Luo Tian’s group had only six left.

“Useless bunch! Can’t even pass three hundred feet!” The divine clan’s people sneered, watching the fallen hermits. They had now reached four hundred feet—pressure enough to crush half-saints.

“Only four hundred feet and I already feel this pressure. What about six hundred? Who can reach the Era Bell?” Others gradually reached four hundred feet, but most were crushed and fell into the ground.

“I can’t go on! I swear this isn’t human!” Diao Dezhu’s face was drenched in sweat, his body marked with cracks. He panted heavily. Though the Shadow Demon Clan’s flesh was strong, it was still inferior to most saint-beast clans. The Shadow Demon Clan excelled in speed, but here, speed was useless unless it burst through to the Era Bell. Otherwise, they’d be crushed.

Nan Gong Yuqing panted heavily, watching the demon clan’s saint heir. Nan Gong Feibai had now reached five hundred feet, his face fierce as he infused bloodlight into his body.

“Don’t overexert!” Luo Tian also felt uncomfortable. His flesh had declined due to his self-destruction, but with deep roots, he wasn’t too strained.

“Luo Tian, this won’t work! Even initial-stage saints can only reach five or six hundred feet. The remaining two hundred are impossible!” Lu Han Tian’s face was urgent as he addressed Luo Tian. If they obtained the pseudo-Era Treasure, it would be a secret weapon for the fire domain and four-star domains.

Luo Tian nodded in agreement, his gaze scanning the remaining people. He thought about how to reach the Era Bell and ring it.

While Luo Tian’s group was discussing, others passed by them quickly.

“Got it!” After thinking for a while, Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with cunning.

Chapter 960: Purification

Within the ancient celestial palace, figures fell like raindrops from the sky. Transcendent-level experts bore painful expressions as they landed on the ground, their falls echoing like drums.

Those who fell were light injuries—broken bones and torn flesh. Others lay flat, spitting blood.

The only commonality was their envy of those still ascending.

Luo Tian smiled, addressing the group: “Success requires sacrifice. Each of us can only carry one person to push forward. That person will fail, otherwise no one can succeed!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s explanation, the group pondered. They weren’t fools; Luo Tian’s meaning was clear—only one could succeed, and only Luo Tian would be accepted.

“I’m in such a weak state now…” Luo Tian smiled, addressing them. But before he finished, Du Hongtao interrupted.

“I’ll go first!” Du Hongtao’s voice made the group pause. They hadn’t expected him to act first.

“Respect your elders! You and Lu should go last. If you two do it, there’s still a chance!” Luo Tian quickly countered, addressing Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian.

“Enough. It’s your generation now. What use are we old bones? Our limit is initial-stage saint, never reaching the legendary Era realm. If we could obtain this Era Bell, it would greatly benefit your future cultivation!” Lu Han Tian shook his head.

Before Luo Tian could argue, Du Hongtao roared and unleashed a massive sacred power. He enveloped the group in golden light, protecting them from pressure.

Though slow, they ascended steadily. Luo Tian’s method was viable, but cultivation world people were selfish—each wanted success. Though someone noticed Luo Tian’s method, no one used it.

Du Hongtao smiled, leading the group to five hundred and fifty feet. He finally couldn’t hold on, waved goodbye, and descended gently.

Though he landed smoothly, Du Hongtao was the first initial-stage saint to fall.

“Hmph!” Murmurs of surprise echoed. People’s gazes swept over Luo Tian’s group, amazed they had reached five hundred and fifty feet—only initial-stage saints.

Luo Tian’s group, excluding Lu Han Tian, were all half-saints or transcendent-level experts. Even Chen Zhanbiao, a nine-source transcendent, was astonishing.

“Now it’s my turn!” Lu Han Tian laughed and took Du Hongtao’s place, instantly moving forward to protect the group.

“Six hundred feet… six hundred and fifty feet…” Each foot disappeared beneath them. They were getting closer to the Era Bell.

Lu Han Tian, an initial-stage saint, led Luo Tian’s group. They first met the thunder domain’s people, who looked surprised.

“They’re cheating!” Li Maode’s face bore anger. But he soon slumped, watching two remaining initial-stage saints. He wanted to imitate Luo Tian’s method but couldn’t command them without Li Xingteng’s authority.

People now fully understood Luo Tian’s method, their faces showing shock and bitterness. They hadn’t expected such a trick, but it was too late—most were hermits who couldn’t support each other to the Era Bell.

As Lu Han Tian pushed forward, people saw others from different domains nearby—like the demon clan.

“Damn it! Why didn’t we think of this!” The demon clan saw Luo Tian’s method and realized, imitating it.

Other factions also changed their faces, imitating Luo Tian’s group.

“Seven hundred feet!” With Lu Han Tian’s push, Luo Tian’s group reached seven hundred feet. Only the divine clan, demon clan, Shura domain, and beast domain’s eight great clans remained—close by, just tens of feet away.

“I’m no match for Lu Xiong!” Du Hongtao, now with Shu and Tian Luo, smiled bitterly. He hadn’t expected such a gap between himself and Lu Han Tian.

Though both had reached one hundred and fifty feet, the height was different. Du Hongtao could imagine how much Lu Han Tian had consumed to reach seven hundred feet.

Tian Luo and Shu also bore bitterness. They were top talents in the four-star domains, once fighting alongside Luo Tian. Now they had become a hindrance, which was hard for their proud hearts to accept.

“Haha, you’re still young!” Du Hongtao comforted the two, who looked defeated.

“I can’t rely on Luo Tian anymore. If I leave this ancient celestial palace, I’ll forge my own path!” Tian Luo’s face bore determination. He had once been the top talent of the southern domain, but now he was surpassed by Xu Liyi. He wasn’t used to it.

“Indeed, we’ve relied too much on Luo Tian! Let’s go!” Shu shook his head. Though he enjoyed being with this group, their growth was slow. They preferred survival in desperate situations, not relying on Luo Tian’s protection—this hindered their growth.

“Now it’s my turn!” Xu Liyi smiled playfully, taking Lu Han Tian’s place and leading the group upward.

With Lu Han Tian and Du Hongtao’s descent, Luo Tian’s group lost an initial-stage saint.

Xu Liyi’s face was pale. He led the group only fifty feet before collapsing, sweat dripping from his body.

“I can’t do it! Who’ll take over?” Xu Liyi cursed, smiling and waving to the group.

“Get those demon clan bastards!” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, taking Xu Liyi’s place.

“Haha, kid! Without an initial-stage saint, even if you reach the Era Bell, what good is it? You’re just a half-saint waste!” Feng Jiutian laughed, his voice echoing.

Entering the hundred feet range, they couldn’t rely on tricks. The remaining great clan members were separated, forced to go alone. At a hundred feet, they could see the Era Bell’s full form and feel its immense pressure.

“Go!” Feng Jiutian smiled, waving to the beast domain’s people. He flew toward the Era Bell but at a snail’s pace, his body emitting white smoke.

“Purification power!” The divine clan behind the beast domain stood at nine hundred feet, watching the beast domain’s people suffer.

The divine clan was delighted. After their exhaustion, they had only Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen left—both were candidates for the divine clan’s saint heir and goddess. Their status was high, so they protected them to reach the highest point. If either obtained the Era Bell, it would be a great help for the divine clan.

“Purification power! The gods bless us!” Sun Feiwen laughed, standing behind Sun Mengru.

“Go!” Sun Mengru glanced at Sun Feiwen and moved forward, chasing the beast domain’s people.

The demon clan followed closely. Only one saint heir remained—Nan Gong Feibai, his face grim at the nine hundred feet threshold.

“Troublesome! But still need to push!” Zhou Wei smiled, standing there. He looked down.

“Alas, little Luo, I can only take you this far. The Era Bell is good, but I’m not too interested. So, you take it!” Diao Dezhu’s pale face sent Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao beyond nine hundred feet. His voice carried a hint of melancholy and arrogance.

Luo Tian was speechless, watching Diao Dezhu fly downward. He recovered with pills, his face regaining some color: “Don’t worry, I’ll claim this Era Bell!”

“Big brother, it’s my turn!” Chen Zhanbiao grumbled. He didn’t know how to use his fundamental power but grabbed Luo Tian, carrying him toward the Era Bell.

“Idiot!” Nan Gong Feibai sneered. He knew Chen Zhanbiao, a nine-source transcendent, would die.

The beast domain’s people ahead also sneered. They were already in the hundred feet range, knowing the terrifying purification power. Even after thirty feet, they felt their bodies boiling.

“A mere nine-source transcendent dares to enter beyond nine hundred feet? It’s too naive. Even surviving three breaths is a miracle!” Sun Feiwen sneered, following Sun Mengru. His aura protected him as he chased the beast domain’s people.

Sun Mengru glanced back, looking at Luo Tian on Chen Zhanbiao’s back. Her brows furrowed slightly before she flew upward.

Luo Tian’s face also changed. As Chen Zhanbiao entered the hundred feet range, Luo Tian felt a purification power冲击 his flesh.

“This is purification power!” Luo Tian mused. The test after nine hundred feet wasn’t about sacred power but flesh and cultivation.

Luo Tian felt relieved. He knew Chen Zhanbiao’s flesh was strong; he could withstand the purification power.

Indeed, as soon as they entered the hundred feet range, Chen Zhanbiao’s face changed slightly but then returned to normal: “Nothing much. Just felt a bit hot!”

Chapter 961: Stop Him

Above the hall, Chen Zhanbiao’s mighty figure carried Luo Tian forward without hesitation.

Chen Zhanbiao thought simply flying toward the bell as others had done would suffice. But Luo Tian knew this hundred feet was no simple task. The fact that the beast domain’s people had dispersed and Nan Gong Feibai, as well as Starfield Domain members hadn’t rushed forward indicated this hundred feet held something to fear.

Before Luo Tian could speak, Chen Zhanbiao carried him forward into the hundred feet range.

“Idiot!” Nan Gong Feibai sneered, watching a mere nine-source transcendent dare to carry Luo Tian in. He knew Chen Zhanbiao would die.

The beast domain’s people ahead also sneered at Chen Zhanbiao. They were already in the hundred feet range, knowing the terrifying purification power. Even after thirty feet, they felt their bodies boiling.

“A nine-source transcendent dares to enter beyond nine hundred feet? It’s too naive. Surviving three breaths is a miracle!” Sun Feiwen sneered, following Sun Mengru. His aura protected him as he chased the beast domain’s people.

Sun Mengru glanced back, looking at Luo Tian on Chen Zhanbiao’s back. Her brows furrowed slightly before she flew upward.

Luo Tian’s face also changed. As Chen Zhanbiao entered the hundred feet range, Luo Tian felt a purification power冲击 his flesh.

“This is purification power!” Luo Tian mused. The test after nine hundred feet wasn’t about sacred power but flesh and cultivation.

Luo Tian felt relieved. He knew Chen Zhanbiao’s flesh was strong; he could withstand the purification power.

Indeed, as soon as they entered the hundred feet range, Chen Zhanbiao’s face changed slightly but then returned to normal: “Nothing much. Just felt a bit hot!”
