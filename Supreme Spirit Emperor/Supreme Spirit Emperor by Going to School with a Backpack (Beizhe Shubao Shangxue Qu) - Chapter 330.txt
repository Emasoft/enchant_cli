“Ferocious God’s Wrath Treads the Nine Heavens!” Before Qi Ziyang could finish speaking, Luo Tian’s roar shattered through the air, sending both Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance into a shudder. Their bodies recoiled violently.

Yet moments later, their expressions darkened. Luo Tian had not moved an inch, arms crossed, regarding them like clowns.

“You deserve to die!” Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance seethed, their faces contorted with humiliation. To be intimidated by Luo Tian’s voice was an unbearable insult. Yet they did not charge him, instead moving their hands swiftly.

Golden light flickered from Hun Tiance’s palms, and a terrifying pressure spread across the starry void. A golden talisman burst forth from his grasp, radiating supreme power and hovering above his head.

“The aura of an Ancient King!” Luo Tian’s face darkened instantly upon seeing the talisman.

“You think we came unprepared? We knew your strength, yet we intercepted you—because we had everything planned!”

“This is a discarded talisman forged by the Hun Tian clan’s ancient king. Though abandoned, it suffices to subdue you!” Hun Tiance’s eyes flashed coldly as he spoke.

“Buzz…” Before Luo Tian could recover from the talisman’s shock, Qi Ziyang also unleashed a black net, imbued with a fragment of epochal power.

Luo Tian’s expression turned grim. He knew trouble had arrived. Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance were no major threat—they could not stop him—but the methods they had summoned were terrifying. Anything tied to an epochal master or Ancient King was inherently reckless.

His greatest fear, however, lay in the Curse God Pill within his body. This binding force prevented him from killing them; he feared what backlash might follow if he did. Perhaps it would kill him outright through curse energy.

Hun Tiance smirked, pressing a drop of blood into the golden talisman.

The next moment, the talisman shot forth from his head, instantly hovering over Luo Tian’s. A terrifying pressure coalesced into a storm, sweeping across his body.

“Crush him!” Hun Tiance slammed his hand downward, and thunderous rumbles echoed. Golden lightning surged from the talisman, striking Luo Tian with violent force.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath Treads the Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian had no choice but to unleash his full power. His golden foot shot forth, stomping directly at the talisman.

Chapter 1344: Desperation ()

The golden foot collided with the talisman, unleashing a thunderous explosion that shook the stars. Vast cracks splintered across the void as their clash resonated.

Luo Tian’s indomitable physique plummeted, his thigh riddled with jagged wounds. Blood stained his right leg.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath Shatters the Stars… Ferocious God’s Five Steps Shake the World!” Luo Tian, however, seemed oblivious. His second step… third step… fifth step followed in rapid succession.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Four deafening explosions echoed through the stars, leaving Hun Tiance and Qi Ziyang pale.

After five steps, each collision with the golden talisman caused Luo Tian to spit blood. The wounds on his right leg spread across his body.

“Boom!” Yet Luo Tian’s relentless assault shattered the talisman, unleashing a golden epochal storm that vanished into their sight.

“Even an abandoned talisman from an Ancient King couldn’t kill him!” Hun Tiance and Qi Ziyang were stunned, their faces etched with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian, drenched in golden divine blood.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian spat blood, standing bent in the void, gasping heavily. A faint smile tugged at his lips, though bitterness lingered in his heart.

“Truly formidable. Even a discarded talisman left me so battered. If it had been a real one, it would have killed me outright!” Luo Tian marveled at the Ancient King clan’s methods. He swallowed a mid-grade sacred pill, striving to mend his wounds swiftly.

But before he could catch his breath, an invisible wave surged through the black void, striking his mind. Luo Tian’s heart jolted.

“Damn!” He cursed inwardly, summoning his legs to flee—but they felt as if bound by a mountain.

His injuries were too severe. To withstand the golden talisman, only his indomitable physique had saved him. Any epochal mid-stage cultivator would have bled out, or at least regenerated blood. Luo Tian’s current state was already miraculous.

“Buzz…” The black net materialized invisibly, instantly enveloping Luo Tian. As it clung to his flesh, a supreme refining force surged through him.

Pain—unbearable pain—ravaged his body, worsening his wounds.

“Even if you blocked the talisman, you can’t withstand my Lock Dragon Net!” Qi Ziyang’s face was cold. Seeing Luo Tian ensnared, he闪身 forward, landing a kick on Luo Tian’s chest.

“Boom!” Luo Tian was launched backward by the blow, and Qi Ziyang felt a sense of relief.

“Don’t worry. You won’t die easily. I won’t kill you. I know you hail from the Nine Realms; we still hope to extract the secret of entering them from you,” Qi Ziyang gloated.

“I’ll torment this so-called genius who treads golden sunlight!” Hun Tiance also grinned, flying toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s face was ashen. The black net had embedded itself in his flesh, refining his blood and qi.

“Reincarnation Immortal Body! Shatter!” Luo Tian roared, his illusory Reincarnation Immortal Body shattering. Pure epochal energy surged into his body, swelling it with power.

“Break!” Luo Tian bellowed, channeling the wild epochal energy. His body swelled violently, his qi surging with an overwhelming aura.

“Crack…” The black net’s threads emerged from his flesh, snapping one by one under Luo Tian’s force.

As Hun Tiance reached him, Luo Tian finally broke free from the net, his face twisted with hatred.

“I’ll see what curse energy awaits me for killing two royal prodigies!” Luo Tian’s long hair flew, his murderous intent now fully awakened.

“Ferocious God’s Five Steps Shake the World!” He roared, launching his fifth step toward Hun Tiance, who had closed in.

From the moment Luo Tian’s Reincarnation Immortal Body shattered to his fifth step, mere moments had passed. Hun Tiance hadn’t expected Luo Tian to break the Lock Dragon Net.

Hun Tiance’s face still bore his smugness when a golden foot, like a meteor, rocketed toward him. Luo Tian’s foot bore intricate Daoic patterns.

Though wounded, Luo Tian’s fifth step still radiated terrifying power.

“Boom!” Blood mist erupted, grey qi materializing before Qi Ziyang’s eyes, causing his face to twitch.

“Ah…” As Hun Tiance turned into blood mist, a grey flame coiled around Luo Tian’s soul, beginning to scorch it.

Pain seared through Luo Tian’s body. Cold sweat mixed with blood, dripping from his form as he writhed in agony.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian endured the pain, Hun Tiance’s form gradually reassembled. His face was deathly pale, his gaze now filled with terror.

“The curse energy is activating!” Seeing Luo Tian’s agony, Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance felt a surge of joy. They had witnessed Luo Tian swallow the Curse God Pill, and they trusted in the蛮族’s curse techniques.

“Haha! Even if you survived the king’s methods, that curse will make you suffer. I’ll see what you have left to fight us with!” Qi Ziyang laughed, charging forward again. His black hand凝聚, slamming down on Luo Tian with all his might.

This strike carried Qi Ziyang’s boundless resentment. His hand, fueled by his full strength, aimed to crush Luo Tian into blood regeneration—then he would be a helpless victim.

The soul-piercing pain made Luo Tian lucid. He soon adapted, though the agony was still immense.

“Kill!” Luo Tian was frenzied. With pain at its peak, he launched another golden foot—again the fifth step.

“Boom… boom…” The stars cracked, and Qi Ziyang’s black hand was shattered. Luo Tian’s foot crushed into his body.

Blood mist filled the air, and Qi Ziyang had unleashed all his strength. Luo Tian, too, had given everything—his epochal early-stage might made him invincible even wounded.

“Ah…” Another grey flame rose, coiling around Luo Tian’s soul, burning it. He could no longer contain his scream, trembling violently.

“He…” Qi Ziyang’s body slowly reassembled, his face pale as he stood beside Hun Tiance. They exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with intense disbelief.

The situation had changed rapidly. Their cultivation had dropped to the brink of epochal stage, filling them with fear toward Luo Tian.

They had never seen such an abnormal person—first surviving two epochal masters’ techniques, then enduring the蛮族’s curse. They had been reduced to half-epochal stage.

“What monster is he? I feel like he’s not even human… more like a royal!” Qi Ziyang stood there, his voice trembling. Though Luo Tian screamed in pain, looking dire, he dared not approach again. He feared another footstep would leave no chance for blood regeneration.

Hun Tiance felt the same. Though he had known Luo Tian was formidable, fighting him firsthand brought another feeling.

“Roar!” Luo Tian roared to the sky, catching his breath for a moment before adapting to the soul-burning pain.

“At least bearable… I wonder what curse awaits if I kill them!” Luo Tian’s face was ashen, his body trembling. His eyes locked onto Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance like a wolf fixated on prey.

Seeing Luo Tian’s gaze, Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance shivered slightly. Hun Tiance then shouted: “Luo Tian, if you kill us, the curse will intensify several times. It might even end your life!”

“Doesn’t matter! I’ll see if this curse can kill me!” Luo Tian’s mind calculated the curse’s strength after killing them. After all, he couldn’t avoid fighting royal clan members forever.

“Kid, you’re quite clever! Your tricks are many—escaping our grasp from Star Moon Divine City!” As Luo Tian pondered, a cold voice echoed through the stars. At the same time, three streaks of light like multicolored meteors appeared in their sight.

“We’re from the royal clan!” Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance’s faces lit up with joy upon hearing the voice. Seeing three streaks form into three middle-aged men, they flew toward them.

“Trouble’s here!” Luo Tian felt a pang of despair, sighing inwardly.

“Three epochal mid-stage! Even if I die, I can’t beat them!” Luo Tian sighed bitterly, then his eyes turned wild, staring at the two men behind them.

Chapter 1345: Lucky Escape ()

Luo Tian’s eyes locked onto the two men behind the three epochal mid-stage. Three epochal mid-stage—his mind was already filled with despair. If he were at his peak, maybe a slim chance remained. But now, wounded and exhausted, there was no way to survive.

His only goal now was to kill Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance before he died, but it was a futile dream.

The three epochal mid-stage saw Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance’s state, their faces slightly changed. Though they hailed from different royal clans, they knew Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance’s strength. Now seeing them so battered was shocking.

In awe, they moved their fingers, sealing the vast stars. They wouldn’t let Luo Tian escape.

“Kid, surrender quietly. You’ll suffer less,” a middle-aged man with blood qi said, his gaze on Luo Tian, eyes flickering with amusement.

“Blood Clan!” Luo Tian instantly sensed the man’s identity, his eyes cold.

“Yes, we know you’re from the Nine Realms. We won’t kill you! Come with me quietly!” The man looked at Luo Tian, pale and bleeding.

“Go to hell!” As the man’s words ended, Luo Tian suddenly unleashed his hidden technique. His body became a blur, vanishing from the spot and appearing behind Qi Ziyang, grabbing for him.

Teleportation—Luo Tian hadn’t used it in a long time, but now it played a crucial role. Teleportation was powerful but had major drawbacks: short range and requiring preparation time.

Luo Tian’s previous battles either involved long distances or urgency, making any slip fatal. With his entry into the epochal early-stage, Yumen Gui Bu’s speed had reached its peak, surpassing teleportation slightly. Thus, he hadn’t used it much.

Luo Tian’s sudden attack startled the five men, especially Qi Ziyang, who felt a series of breaths behind him. Without thinking, he turned and launched his fist at Luo Tian.

“Smack!” But Qi Ziyang was too weak now. Though wounded, Luo Tian still held the epochal early-stage advantage over Qi Ziyang’s half-epochal state.

Luo Tian grabbed Qi Ziyang’s fist, neutralizing the overwhelming punch. Then he pulled him forward, his face twisted with ferocity, and retreated.

Too fast—Luo Tian’s desperate speed was even faster than his peak. He quickly distanced himself from the four men.

“Let him go!” A middle-aged man in black qi shouted, the one who had come with Qi Ziyang and Qirongxiu to Star Moon Divine City.

“Don’t come near!” Luo Tian coldly replied, gripping Qi Ziyang and shouting at the three epochal mid-stage.

“Kid, if you let him go, we might spare your life. But if he dies, you’ll be doomed!” The black-robed man barked, his pressure sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Pf…” Luo Tian grabbed Qi Ziyang’s arm, forcing it apart with a mighty grip. His eyes were deep.

“Either way, you’ll die in their hands. Let him accompany me to death!” Luo Tian coldly said, gazing at the four men.

“Ah…” Qi Ziyang’s scream echoed. He looked to the black-robed man, knowing only he could save him now.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian threatened Qi Ziyang, a golden light rose from behind him. A golden sword slashed down, aiming for Luo Tian.

The golden blade cleaved through the stars, instantly striking Luo Tian’s back. He was startled—didn’t expect them to attack him so ruthlessly, even if it meant Qi Ziyang’s death.

“You!” The black-robed man of the Qilin clan turned pale, glaring at the other two epochal mid-stage. He hadn’t expected them to attack.

Luo Tian, facing an epochal mid-stage’s strike, didn’t dare be careless. He placed Qi Ziyang in front of him as a shield against the golden blade.

“Pf…” Blood splattered, Qi Ziyang was split in two and exploded into a blood mist before Luo Tian’s eyes.

The blade continued striking Luo Tian, though its power had lessened. Still, it left a wound on his chest, blood and flesh exposed grotesquely.

“Damn!” Luo Tian moved instantly, vanishing from the spot. His eyes were deep as he gazed at the five men.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected them to be so ruthless, attacking him even if it meant Qi Ziyang’s death.

“What do you mean?” The black-robed Qilin clan man’s face was dark, his body becoming a streak of light as he rushed toward Luo Tian. He noticed Qi Ziyang’s blood slowly coalescing—this time, he couldn’t fail. This was Qi Ziyang’s second blood regeneration.

Regenerating twice—this time, it was the Hun Tian clan’s strength that had planned it. But there was still a gamble; he wasn’t sure if Qi Ziyang would regenerate again.

However, the Hun Tian clan’s strength had won this gamble. Though Qi Ziyang regenerated slowly, he was gradually gathering his body.

“Kid, without a hostage, what are you?” The blood clan’s strength’s eyes lit up. His blood qi surged, forming a blood-colored ghost face with two fangs extending from its mouth. The fangs glowed coldly, lunging toward Luo Tian.

“Done!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, watching the Qilin clan’s middle-aged man approach. He swung his fists to clash with him.

“Crack…” Luo Tian’s already wounded arm exploded, blood spewing from his mouth as he was thrown backward.

“Roar…” A red light circled Luo Tian’s head, the fangs’ cold glow making him feel despair.

“Finished!” The three epochal mid-stage men smiled at each other.

“Huff…” At the same time, Qi Ziyang’s face was pale as he coalesced. His eyes were filled with fear—just a little longer, and he would have felt death’s proximity.

Qi Ziyang looked at the Hun Tian clan strength who had split him into blood mist, resentment rising in his heart. But he dared not show it. His eyes were filled with hatred as he watched Luo Tian about to be devoured by the blood ghost face.

“Once we find the secret, hand him over to me. I’ll make him suffer endlessly!” Qi Ziyang coldly said.

“Good! I have no objections!” The Hun Tian clan’s middle-aged man felt a bit guilty toward Qi Ziyang and nodded.

Luo Tian sensed the danger but had no solution. His body was barely holding together; even his severed arm couldn’t regenerate. His Reincarnation Immortal Body in the dantian was also weak.

Cold air made Luo Tian shiver, his heart filled with resentment. But he had no way to escape this crisis.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath Treads the Nine Heavens!”

“Endless Sword! Sword Without End!” As Luo Tian despaired, two low voices echoed through the stars. The entire void trembled, and a flicker of hope appeared in Luo Tian’s eyes.

“Buzz…” A golden sword storm swept through the stars, annihilating countless stars and rushing toward the group.

A cataclysmic storm, it passed Luo Tian, charging at the three royal clan members. Its power was overwhelming, making the three epochal mid-stage men’s faces grim. Though they weren’t affected much, Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance definitely couldn’t withstand it.

The three formed a barrier, enclosing the five within it to block the golden sword storm.

Meanwhile, a golden foot like a meteor instantly descended upon Luo Tian’s head, colliding with the blood ghost face about to devour him.

The explosion shattered the stars, and both the blood ghost face and golden foot exploded. A wild wave swept over Luo Tian’s body.

“Go!” As the terrifying storm raged, a tall figure appeared before Luo Tian. A golden hand reached out, grabbing him without hesitation. He took a step, carrying Luo Tian into the stars.

“Who is it!” The sword storm gradually calmed down, and the three royal clan men’s faces were dark.

An angry roar echoed through the stars! Then, the three epochal mid-stage royal clan figures闪身 forward, grabbing Hun Tiance and Qi Ziyang. They followed the震荡 stars, chasing after them outside.

“It’s Ferocious Seven Steps! It’s the蛮族!” A low, angry voice echoed through the stars.

Luo Tian forced back the urge to faint, gazing at the tall figure who had grabbed him. His eyes were filled with confusion.

The one who saved him was a蛮族 giant. Though the giant’s face was old, his qi was powerful, radiating a wild蛮荒 aura.

“Kid, you’re really tough!” As Luo Tian wondered who the蛮 giant was, a old voice spoke. A elder appeared beside the蛮 giant, and Luo Tian sighed in relief.

Chapter 1346: Elder of the Stone Clan ()

“Wu Ya’s elder!” Luo Tian’s face showed a bitter smile, gazing at the elder flying beside the蛮 giant. He sighed in relief.

“Let’s return to Seven Star Island first!” Yun Wuya’s face was grim, his hand gripping the Endless Sword. He and the蛮 giant flew swiftly, rushing into the蛮族 continent.

Luo Tian recovered his wounds while observing the蛮 giant carrying him. His eyes showed understanding.

This蛮 giant was covered in wounds, with grey talismans dancing on his massive, grotesque scars. The familiar aura made Luo Tian realize this giant also bore curse energy.

“Stone Clan Elder Shi Tianming?” Luo Tian quickly deduced. Previously, when Yun Wuya saw the Endless Sword on Seven Star Island, he left abruptly to save Stone Clan’s elder. Now it seemed he succeeded.

Luo Tian was correct—the蛮 giant elder was Shi Tianming, the elder of Nanying Stone寨. Yun Wuya had been hiding outside the蛮荒城, waiting for an opportunity to rescue Shi Tianming. But he had no chance until the蛮族’s Saban left, giving him a last shot to enter the Ferocious God Palace and save Shi Tianming.

But neither of them had it easy. Though Saban was gone, the Ferocious God Palace still held epochal late-stage and mid-stage cultivators. They had barely escaped, finding a remote continent to heal. Now they were returning to the蛮族 continent when they met Luo Tian.

At first, Yun Wuya thought it was an attack by the Star Moon Divine Clan. He and Shi Tianming had observed secretly, but as time passed, the three royal clan members called Luo Tian’s name. Plus, Luo Tian had been severely wounded and couldn’t maintain the illusion of his mask. This made Yun Wuya and Shi Tianming act, saving Luo Tian.

Shi Tianming strode through the sky at breakneck speed, with a continuous sound of breaking air in Luo Tian’s ears.

At epochal mid-stage speed, the three had traveled across the蛮族 continent in a day, finally sighing in relief.

“Elder, let me down. I’m fine now!” Luo Tian spoke to Shi Tianming, his voice filled with gratitude.

“Hmph.” Shi Tianming and Yun Wuya also sighed in relief. They had pushed their speed to the limit that day, reaching Seven Star Sea.

“How did you escape from Seven Star Island?” Yun Wuya’s face showed confusion, his gaze on Luo Tian, asking with curiosity.

“Looking for an artifact that can sense the Nine Realms!” Luo Tian felt the black and white qi in his dantian, a faint smile on his face. No matter what, this journey was worth it.

“You found it?” Seeing Luo Tian’s expression, Yun Wuya’s body trembled, his eyes wide with excitement. Even Shi Tianming’s massive form shook, his large eyes glowing with intensity as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Yes! It was found, but I don’t know if it works!” Luo Tian’s face remained pale as he pointed, the black and white qi swirling around his fingertips.

“What is this?” Yun Wuya and Shi Tianming looked puzzled, watching the swirling qi around Luo Tian’s fingertips.

“It is an artifact from the Nine Realms, part of an epochal treasure. This black and white qi is its essence!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes filled with nostalgia.

“Good! Good! Good! I never thought a human from Seven Star Island would have the chance to return to the Nine Realms! This is a great achievement!” Yun Wuya laughed heartily, his gaze on Luo Tian, eyes filled with excitement.

As they spoke, the three passed through Seven Star Island’s outer barrier and entered its sky. Their landing spot was the familiar Third Island.

“Who is it? So large!” As they landed, the Third Island’s people stirred, gazing at Shi Tianming’s obvious, massive form.

“It’s the蛮族! Has the蛮族 invaded?” The entire Third Island trembled instantly. Its disciples erupted in chaos.

The news spread quickly to Shen Gongfu, who’s plump body surged skyward, appearing over the Third Island with his Seven Star Sword.

As Shen Gongfu appeared, light flashed from the other six islands. Six island masters held their Seven Star Swords and instantly appeared over the Third Island, standing with Shen Gongfu. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Who are you? How did you enter Seven Star Island?” The Grandmaster Tong Yangjian’s face was grim as he addressed Shi Tianming, his voice filled with killing intent.

“Haha, don’t be alarmed. This is my old friend, not an enemy!” Yun Wuya appeared before Shi Tianming, smiling as he addressed Tong Yangjian and the others.

“Wu Ya’s elder!” At this moment, people noticed Yun Wuya and bowed respectfully.

“Rise. This time not only did I return, but I also brought someone. You won’t believe it!” Yun Wuya smiled, gazing at Luo Tian who slowly appeared in their sight.

“He is! Deputy Island Master!” As Luo Tian appeared, the Third Island’s disciples immediately recognized him. They were stunned, eyes filled with disbelief.

“Grandmaster, fellow island masters, it’s been a while!” Luo Tian, pale-faced but smiling, bowed to them. His face showed a touch of emotion.

“Luo Tian!” Seven island masters felt their hearts tremble, gazing at Luo Tian with surprise.

They knew Luo Tian had left to find an artifact that could sense the Nine Realms, but they hadn’t expected success. Yet now, after three years, his return brought joy and curiosity about whether he had succeeded.

“Not in vain!” Luo Tian smiled, seeing the hope in their eyes. He nodded slightly.

“Haha!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the seven island masters laughed heartily. Their old eyes glistened with tears, their bodies trembling.

Though the seven masters were excited, they didn’t shout. This matter was too important; they feared leaking the secret.

Everyone gazed at Luo Tian, eyes filled with gratitude. They could imagine how difficult it was for Luo Tian, a human alone in the dangerous Ancient King clan. Just looking at his pale face and unhealed wounds showed he had survived nine deaths.

Everyone who knew Luo Tian’s destination felt gratitude, even the Third Island’s second preceptor Hu Jianhua and his brother who had previously held a grudge against Luo Tian now fully submitted, no longer showing hostility.

“Luo Tian, you’re amazing!” Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong flew out, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

Yang Jinghua’s cultivation had reached the epochal early-stage in these two years, his aura formidable.

“Enough. Let this kid rest and recover. Then you all prepare! Luo Tian has wounds. Whatever matters, wait until his wounds heal!” Yun Wuya smiled, addressing the group.

“Luo Tian!” As Yun Wuya’s words ended, a furious voice suddenly echoed. A streak of light instantly appeared before them.

Sword qi surged, battle intent filled the air. The young figure’s powerful aura made Luo Tian’s eyes narrow slightly before he smiled bitterly.

“Guan Xingjian!” Recognizing the person, people suddenly remembered something—something no one had dared mention in two years.

Guan Xingjian trembled, his eyes fixed on Luo Tian. He thought of the moment he had knelt before Luo Tian, and his eyes flared with fire.

The clash of swords began. Guan Xingjian drew his sword from his back, its tip pointing directly at Luo Tian: “Dare you fight?”

“This…” People were stunned, gazing at Guan Xingjian’s overwhelming aura.

“Xingjian, don’t be foolish! Luo Tian has done great things for Seven Star Island!” Tong Yangjian scolded him gently.

“Master, this isn’t over! I won’t kill him!” Guan Xingjian spoke coldly, his voice resolute.

“Go back!” Yun Wuya waved his hand, striking Guan Xingjian and sending him back ten feet. But his eyes still stared at Luo Tian.

“Dare you fight? I won’t force you. If you win, we’ll call it even. If not, kneel and apologize to me! This isn’t too much, right?” Guan Xingjian stared at Luo Tian, ignoring Yun Wuya’s strike.

“Fine! But I need three days to recover!” Luo Tian sighed, knowing this fight was unavoidable. If he didn’t fight, Guan Xingjian would have problems.

“Fine, I’ll wait for you!” Guan Xingjian then bowed to Yun Wuya and Tong Yangjian before vanishing from their sight.

“Luo Tian, don’t mind it. I’ll go劝 him!” Tong Yangjian sighed, addressing Luo Tian.

“No, don’t,” Luo Tian shook his head, smiling and declining Tong Yangjian’s kindness.

“Haha, there’s going to be a show! Luo Tian has been holding back for two years. Guan Xingjian even obtained the inheritance of Heaven Sword Mountain! You’ll have to be careful!” Hu Tianzong chuckled, his eyes filled with schadenfreude.

“You, never mind. Be merciful,” Yun Wuya looked at Luo Tian’s pale face and shook his head gently. He had seen Luo Tian’s strength before; even he wasn’t sure if he could defeat him.

“Enough, everyone disperse!” Yun Wuya sighed deeply, gazing at the direction Guan Xingjian had left.

Chapter 1347: Tension ()

“Yes!” Hearing Yun Wuya’s words, people were puzzled. They didn’t know what “be merciful” meant to Yun Wuya.

“Is Elder Wu Ya thinking Guan Xingjian can’t beat Luo Tian?” People murmured as Yun Wuya and Shi Tianming vanished.

“Guan Xingjian has the Star-Refining Body, and I heard he’s even attained the inheritance of Heaven Sword Mountain in these two years. Though Luo Tian has the Reincarnation Body, it’s impossible to crush Guan Xingjian!” People murmured, gazing at Luo Tian’s pale face.

Though they knew Luo Tian was strong and had defeated Hu Tianzong, Guan Xingjian’s strength in Seven Star Island was deeply rooted. Even if Luo Tian was stronger, it wouldn’t be a crushing victory. People still believed Guan Xingjian had a great chance to defeat Luo Tian.
