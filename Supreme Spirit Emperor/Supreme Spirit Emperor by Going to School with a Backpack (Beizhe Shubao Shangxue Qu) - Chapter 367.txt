“Your actions are tantamount to seeking death!” The peak elder of the Ming Clan, observing how Ming Huan’s soul essence was weakening and on the verge of complete dissolution, finally could not remain composed. He barked at Luo Tian, his body radiating swirling gray qi as a massive hand of ash-colored energy coalesced and slammed toward Luo Tian.

“Leave!” A cold voice echoed beside Luo Tian, and Hanbing Elder would not ignore it. With a wave of his hand, he clashed again with the Ming Clan’s peak elder.

“Boom…” After a brief collision, both returned to their original positions, locking eyes with one another.

At that moment, Ming Huan’s soul essence was utterly annihilated by the seven-colored flames.

“Ming Huan has fallen!” As Ming Huan’s soul essence vanished, the entire starry sky fell into a deathly silence. Among the ancient tribes, the demise of a royal heir was an unprecedented event that left people stunned and disbelieving.

“Indeed, he’s dead!” Not only were the ancient tribes shocked, but even human clans gazed at Luo Tian in silence.

“You really don’t wish to live!” The faces of a dozen royal clan peak elders darkened, their eyes brimming with murderous intent as they fixed Luo Tian in their gaze.

“Roar…” The tribes roared, directing their glares at Luo Tian, as people trembled.

“Kill him and what then?” Yang Jinghua’s face was icy, his gaze cold as he surveyed the four holy star regions behind him.

A dozen epoch peak elders stood there, their power subtly rising again. Their eyes bore an icy gaze toward Luo Tian and his companions.

“Buzz…” Several epoch treasures emitted radiant light. Sun Shengtian and others wore bitter smiles; they were unwilling to fight the royal clan, but if battle was inevitable, the human clans had no choice but to confront.

“We can sit down and talk. Our clan is willing to offer appropriate compensation,” Sun Shengtian spoke.

“Compensation? Blood debts must be repaid with blood. Unless you hand over Luo Tian to us for judgment, what right do you have to negotiate? What qualifications do you possess—three epoch late-stage elders and one beastly peak?” The dozen peak elders sneered.

“We also have royal weapons. Our clan has already dispatched them; when they arrive, what will your human clans do to resist?” Before the human clan could speak, the dozen peak elders sneered again.

“You!” The human clans’ faces flushed with anger, their eyes burning. But the royal clan’s words were undeniably true—if the ancient tribes unleashed their royal weapons, the human clans would be powerless.

“You lack even the qualifications to speak with us. What do you have to negotiate? Now, we offer two choices: surrender the royal heir’s soul essence and that boy Luo Tian, or in a few days, our royal weapons arrive, and your clan is annihilated!”

“Don’t dare threaten us with the Chaos Lord. Though your human clans’ epoch power is formidable, we do not believe there are any epoch lords remaining in this era,” the dozen ancient royal clan peak elders pressed relentlessly. With Luo Tian’s defeat of Ming Huan, their patience had been exhausted, and they resolved to crush the human clans with overwhelming force.

The human clan fell silent, their gazes shifting toward Luo Tian and the soul essence of Yu Fanti in his grasp. Surrendering Yu Fanti’s soul essence was feasible, but surrendering Luo Tian was impossible.

Not only was Luo Tian’s strength formidable and his potential for enlightenment evident, but the four holy star regions’ might was unmatched.

“Since the royal clan has chosen war, let us fight!” As people fell silent, a blade’s radiance suddenly shot through the stars.

A golden blade illuminated the entire starry sky. In an instant, it reached their vicinity—so fast that even the epoch peak elders could not react.

The golden blade swiftly struck Luo Tian’s soul essence of Yu Fanti, annihilating it completely.

“Who is it!” The crowd erupted in chaos, their gazes turning toward the distant stars. Their expressions shifted.

Two figures strode through the celestial bodies, appearing before them in an instant.

A golden long sword rested on his back; a purple jade flute was held in his hand. His face was cold and composed, with an air of mockery.

Yao Yin’s Master and the heir of the Great Reincarnation Body, Zhong Zixuan, instantly recognized him. Upon sensing his aura, Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy.

“Epoch Peak!” The human clan trembled, their gazes turning to Zhong Zixuan. They had not expected the human clan to possess such a young powerhouse, already at peak elder status.

“Parents truly are top-tier figures. They reached epoch peak so swiftly!” Luo Tian marveled, his gaze shifting to the other figure. His body involuntarily trembled.

Unlike Zhong Zixuan’s youth, the middle-aged man stood tall in white robes as snow. His eyes carried infinite沧桑 (sorrow), and he gazed at Luo Tian’s group with a gentle expression.

“Grandfather!” The four holy star regions’ people wore expressions of shock, gazing at the middle-aged man whose aura was restrained yet unfathomable.

The figure of Gu Tian Shu, once the undefeated warrior, still vivid in memory. On the divine mountain of the divine clan, he had single-handedly annihilated two divine clan peers and one epoch late-stage peer before vanishing from sight. For years, people had believed Gu Tian Shu dead, but now he stood before them.

Once a withered old man with failing vitality, Gu Tian Shu was now radiating power. His current form was entirely different from his former withered self—unless one scrutinized closely, it would be hard to recognize him.

“Respect Grandfather!” A crowd of people knelt, their gazes filled with reverence as they looked at Gu Tian Shu standing calmly.

“Hard work. I was delayed by some matters. From now on, it’s my turn,” Gu Tian Shu approached Luo Tian, patted his shoulder, then waved his hand. Several figures emerged from the void.

“Father!”

“Master…”

“Auntie’s husband…” A chorus of voices echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, igniting his excitement.

“You!” Luo Tian gazed at the young figures surrounding him, his voice trembling. He gently patted Lu Li’s head and let out a long laugh.

“Ha! Alive, still alive!” Luo Tian laughed heartily, his eyes glistening with tears. Diao Dezhu and others also wore expressions of joy as they surrounded the younger generations.

“Now, do we have the qualifications to negotiate?” Gu Tian Shu ignored the emotional crowd and turned his gaze toward the dozen royal clan peak elders.

Zhong Zixuan stood there, sheathing his purple jade flute before drawing his long sword. His eyes bore a fierce glint as he locked onto the peak elders, especially Ma Zan of the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan), his eyes sharpening.

Chapter 1469: I Am Gu Tian Shu

Though Gu Tian Shu’s words were calm, they caused the ancient royal clan’s peak elders to display solemn expressions.

With Gu Tian Shu’s arrival, Nan Gong Yuqing, Zhu Ge Qingtian, Yan Hongtao, and Guan Xingjian ceased their battle. They knew that what was to come might be a clash of peak elders, and there was no need for them to continue fighting.

The battered figures returned to the tribes. Man Hun, Fu Xingyue, Tu Feiyang, and Jin Yangxi were the only remaining intact young talents of the royal clan.

The battle of young talents had cost the ancient tribes dearly. The Ming Clan’s Ming Chen was slain, the Qilin Clan’s Qi Ziyang fell, and even two royal heirs had perished.

Compared to the tribes, the human clan fared much better. Only one from the Zhu Ge Imperial Court had died; others like Sun Miechen were severely wounded but would recover in time.

What terrified people was that only Qi Ziyang’s death had been caused by Zhu Ge Qingtian. The rest were all connected to Luo Tian in some way.

Killing two royal heirs—this was deemed impossible by the ancient tribes, an unbreakable enmity.

A royal heir represented legitimacy. Without a royal heir, the clan would lack true authority. This was why the royal heirs held such importance in the ancient tribes, their status unmatched by any.

“Qualifications must be earned!” Though the dozen peak elders felt Zhong Zixuan and Gu Tian Shu were formidable, they did not believe the two could overcome their ten plus.

“Buzz…” Gu Tian Shu smiled, waved his hand, and a radiant light spread. A head writhing with gray qi appeared before them.

“This is a head imbued with the Ming Clan’s aura!” As the gray head appeared, the Ming Clan’s peak elder immediately recognized it as belonging to their clan.

“Ming Zhenyan!” The nine regions’ people instantly identified the head, their eyes filled with shock.

“Ming Zhenyan of the Nine Sacred Clans!” Luo Tian and others were stunned, gazing at Gu Tian Shu’s thrown head. They had not expected him to have slain Ming Zhenyan.

Ming Zhenyan’s strength was well known—epoch peak. This was the second epoch peak elder to be slain in recent years.

The first had been Ming Jiuseng, the eldest of the Ming Clan, slain by Luo Tian’s combined effort with the Master of Lingyun.

“Grandfather possesses the power to slay epoch peak elders!” The four holy star regions’ people were invigorated, gazing at Gu Tian Shu’s smiling face.

“Who are you!” Over a dozen ancient royal clan peak elders’ faces shifted. They could clearly sense Ming Zhenyan’s epoch peak strength.

“I am Gu Tian Shu!” Gu Tian Shu spoke softly, his voice carrying confidence. An invincible aura radiated from him.

“Killing our Ming Clan’s strength, the royal heir, and the saint son—your death is deserved!” The Ming Clan’s peak elder glared with murderous intent, leaping forward to attack Gu Tian Shu.

This invasion had cost the Ming Clan dearly. Their strength among the tribes was formidable, but when did they suffer such a major loss? Now it had finally erupted.

“You’re not worthy!” Zhong Zixuan glanced at the Ming Clan’s elder, then his face turned cold. His divine sword radiated brilliant light and instantly appeared before the Ming Clan’s peak elder.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound erupted between both sides. They all retreated, their bodies trembling. An epoch peak clash was beyond their capacity to withstand; even the residual energy would injure many.

After retreating ten million miles, they stopped. Some had even summoned treasures for protection before gazing at the thirteen people below.

The human clan’s faces bore concern. Though Gu Tian Shu and Zhong Zixuan were powerful, the enemy was over a dozen peak elders.

“Kill!” Zhong Zixuan wielded his golden divine sword, like a golden warrior of war, charging toward the Ming Clan’s peak elder.

“Join forces and eliminate them!” The remaining dozen elders wore cold expressions, their eyes filled with immense killing intent toward Gu Tian Shu and Zhong Zixuan.

Their presence had instilled a deep sense of crisis. If not killed, they would inevitably become the enemy of the royal clan when the tribes invaded the nine regions.

“Come then!” Gu Tian Shu’s aura surged skyward, unafraid. He actively charged toward the dozen ancient royal clan elders.

“Indeed, Gu Tian Shu stands alone against the tribes’ peak elders! His audacity is beyond our comprehension!” Sun Shengtian and others wore expressions of reverence, gazing at Gu Tian Shu radiating overwhelming power.

“I wonder why he has such vitality now, as if reborn from death!” Sun Shengtian sighed softly.

“Boom… Boom…” As people marveled, Gu Tian Shu and Zhong Zixuan clashed with the ancient royal clan’s peak elders. The thunderous sound was deafening, and even from afar, people felt a deep sense of fear.

Fourteen epoch peak elders surrounded Gu Tian Shu and Zhong Zixuan, their eyes cold.

“You may be formidable, but how can you overcome us? We are thirteen!” The fourteen quickly separated. Seven charged toward Gu Tian Shu, seven toward Zhong Zixuan.

Seven epoch peak elders—just their presence could crush any late-stage epoch. Zhong Zixuan felt immense pressure, his golden long sword emitting a continuous hum as he swung it toward the seven elders.

On the other side, Gu Tian Shu’s black hair flew as his hands moved rapidly. Infinite divine light surged from his palms, and the entire starry sky trembled as a massive glow gathered above him.

“Suppress!” Seeing Gu Tian Shu’s move, the seven elders displayed cold expressions. Their hands emitted radiant light, and seven-colored glows from their palms converged above Gu Tian Shu, forming a miniature world that pressed down on him.

The overwhelming pressure made even Luo Tian and others far away feel powerless to resist.

“This is the power of an epoch peak! Seven combined, who can withstand it!” Luo Tian and others felt fear. They had not expected the seven to unleash an immediate kill, aiming to annihilate Gu Tian Shu with full force.

Faced with the seven’s apocalyptic attack, Gu Tian Shu’s eyes flashed with a glint. His hands moved rapidly, and under the guidance of opportunity, immense pressure instantly fell upon the seven epoch elders.

A golden great cauldron, radiating infinite divine light, seemed to suppress the entire world. A series of scorching imprints radiated from Gu Tian Shu’s hands.

“This is the Fan Tian Attack and Destruction Art!” Only Luo Tian could recognize what Gu Tian Shu was using.

But Luo Tian had not expected Gu Tian Shu to have mastered it to such an extent, unlike himself who merely integrated it into his martial arts and body.

The lid of the golden great cauldron slowly lifted, releasing a surge of misty clouds. It collided with the miniature world formed by the seven elders.

“Boom…” The void shattered, and the golden cauldron struck the miniature world. It exploded into fragments, scattering as divine light under the cauldron’s suppression.

“Puke…” The seven elders’ faces turned pale, their mouths bleeding. Their eyes held disbelief as they gazed at the golden cauldron still intact.

“Is that a epoch treasure?” The seven elders’ eyes held fear. Though they said so, they knew the golden cauldron was not an epoch treasure but a martial art created by Gu Tian Shu.

“Fan Tian Attack and Destruction Art, manifested as a martial technique!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He gazed at the golden cauldron suppressing the heavens, as if a new door had opened in his mind.

“Roar…” The human clan trembled, letting out a deafening roar. They gazed at the seemingly invincible Gu Tian Shu, their blood boiling.

After the miniature world was destroyed, the golden cauldron again attacked the seven epoch elders. The overwhelming pressure made them pale.

“Crack…” The seven figures, their auras piercing the sky, emitted cracking sounds. Their bodies bent uncontrollably.

“One man against seven peak elders! And still managing to suppress them!” People’s faces trembled, gazing at Gu Tian Shu standing there with flowing robes, their eyes filled with disbelief.

The seven elders roared. Their roar shook the heavens. The pressure from the golden cauldron made them feel suffocated, but they were epoch peak elders. Blood gushed from their bodies as their hands moved rapidly.

“Buzz…” A long spear descended across the sky, like the simultaneous rise of sun and moon. It carried ultimate power and smashed into the golden cauldron.

“Barbarian God’s Seven Steps to Shatter Eternity!” Old Sa Man also roared, his body expanding. He stepped down toward the golden cauldron under its pressure.

“Caw…” A piercing cry echoed. The golden divine bird, bathed in divine fire, transformed into a sea of destruction and flew from Old Jin Wu’s hands toward the golden cauldron.

The other four also launched their attacks. The overwhelming waves of power shattered the stars, as if the end times had arrived. The tribes trembled and attacked the golden cauldron.

Chapter 1470: Still Invincible

Terrifying impacts—seven earth-shattering martial arts rose in the void. Seven epoch peak elders unleashed their full strength; each was apocalyptic.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Seven thunderous sounds echoed, and the entire starry sky seemed to consist solely of these resounding vibrations.

“Buzz…” Above the human clan, epoch treasures scattered radiant light, enveloping everyone. Yet even so, despite being far away, some people bled from their seven orifices due to the immense vibrations.

The entire starry sky collapsed, remaining unrepaired for a long time. Fortunately, they were far enough and had epoch treasures to protect them; otherwise, everyone would have turned to dust in this collision.

“Terrifying! This is the power of an epoch peak elder’s battle!” People were stunned. They had thought Luo Tian and others’ late-stage epoch battles were overwhelming, but they hadn’t expected the clash of epoch peak elders to be so terrifying.

The divine power swept across countless miles before stopping. The area it swept through was completely turned into a vacuum, devoid of any matter.

Then people redirected their gaze to the battlefield of Gu Tian Shu and others. Their hearts clenched.

“Invincible!” Seeing their battlefield, everyone’s heart seemed to stop, and the word “invincible” surfaced in their minds.

The golden cauldron bore cracks. Nine true dragons coiled around it, continuously repairing the cauldron’s fractures.

“This still can’t break it!” The seven epoch elders’ faces turned even paler. Blood gushed from their mouths, and they wore expressions of disbelief.

“Who is he? Could he be a provisional epoch lord?”

“No, a provisional epoch lord would not have survived being surrounded by us seven!” The seven elders were thoroughly terrified, gazing at Gu Tian Shu whose aura was gradually stabilizing.

On the other side, Zhong Zixuan did not have Gu Tian Shu’s overwhelming power. Within a brief moment, his body was riddled with wounds.

Gu Tian Shu furrowed his brows, sensing Zhong Zixuan’s crisis. He formed complex hand signs with his hands, and a series of intricate seals flew out.

“Roar…” The true dragons roared. Nine golden long dragons emerged from the golden cauldron, pressing down on the seven who had attacked Gu Tian Shu.

Moreover, two of them targeted the two elders attacking Zhong Zixuan. The human clan gasped in shock.

“Seven weren’t enough, now they’re attacking two more!” Everyone’s eyes held disbelief as they gazed at Gu Tian Shu standing there.

“Back then, Gu Tian Shu was an invincible figure. Now, after living another life, he remains undefeated!” Sun Shengtian and others wore reverence, gazing at Gu Tian Shu radiating overwhelming power.

“Arrogant!” The two elders who had been found by the two golden dragons quickly broke free from Zhong Zixuan’s battle circle to resist the two long dragons.

“Get out…” Nine epoch elders displayed intense anger. Their hands conjured radiant light, and their auras surged as they collided with the nine golden dragons.

The deafening explosion echoed again in the starry sky. The nine elders shattered the golden dragons approaching them, then waved their hands and roared, their voices echoing through the stars.

The starry sky trembled. The nine elders combined forces again, their power more terrifying. They were confident that even a provisional epoch lord would suffer heavy injuries under their combined might.

All human clans gasped, gazing at the apocalyptic waves that pressed toward Gu Tian Shu and the golden cauldron.

“Roar…” The tribes roared. Each ancient royal clan member gazed at the apocalyptic waves with madness in their eyes, believing Gu Tian Shu was surely doomed this time.

“Manifesting the World of Law!” Gu Tian Shu’s eyes slightly narrowed, but his aura remained undiminished. He moved his hands, and his body suddenly expanded to a thousand zhang in height.

With a thunderous roar, the golden cauldron also expanded dramatically above people’s heads, filling the entire starry sky.

“Boom… Boom…” Gu Tian Shu took a step forward, his massive body instantly appearing on the golden cauldron. Then he fell down.

Gu Tian Shu, standing atop the golden cauldron, descended as if a legendary warrior from heaven. His overwhelming aura made the nine elders feel suffocated.

The nine elders’ combined attacks shattered under Gu Tian Shu’s suppression, scattering into divine laws that spread in all directions.

The golden cauldron and Gu Tian Shu, like a celestial being, pushed down with overwhelming power, suppressing the nine elders of the ancient tribes.

At this moment, time seemed to freeze. A permanent imprint was etched into the hearts of both the ancient tribes and human clans.

The human clan roared, their souls stirred. They gazed at the invincible Gu Tian Shu, his风采 (appearance) unparalleled. With a single hand, he suppressed nine elders of the ancient tribes. No one in history could achieve this except for the epoch lord of the human clan.

His white robes flowed as he stood atop a mountain, gazing down at all. The nine elders’ bodies gradually disintegrated, on the verge of becoming blood mist.

Just as their bodies were about to collapse, the golden cauldron slowed down and did not annihilate them.

Everyone’s eyes held confusion as they gazed at Gu Tian Shu standing there, wondering why he had not killed them. After all, the ancient tribes and human clans were enemies; this was an opportunity to solidify his undefeated reputation. Why would Gu Tian Shu abandon it?

“Now, can we sit down and talk?” Gu Tian Shu addressed the nine elders with a smile. His body returned to normal size as he spoke.

“Thank you for not killing us!” The nine elders bowed respectfully to Gu Tian Shu, then stood silently. They clearly acknowledged him.

Everyone’s faces bore disbelief. How could the elders of the ancient tribes bow to a human? Throughout history, Gu Tian Shu was the first. Unless the epoch lord of the human clan returned, no one could receive such treatment.

“People should be like Gu Tian Shu!” Sun Shengtian and others wore expressions of reverence, gazing at his mountain-like figure.

“Puke…” On the other side, after Gu Tian Shu had defeated nine elders, Zhong Zixuan’s pressure lessened. However, five elders still pressed him.

“Stop!” Gu Tian Shu smiled, his golden foot thunderously stepping forward to suppress the five elders.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed. However, these five elders were not as fortunate as the previous nine; under the golden foot’s pressure, their bodies cracked and turned into blood mist floating in the starry sky.

“Ugh…” The flute’s sound echoed. Zhong Zixuan softly played his purple jade flute, and waves of energy spread across the starry sky.

The flute’s sound echoed, beautiful and sublime. It seemed to elevate people’s souls, leaving no other sounds in the starry sky.

The black starry sky began to heal. A tranquil atmosphere spread beneath it.

But the blood mist of the five elders was being eroded by this calm melody.

“What…” The nine surviving elders wore confusion as they gazed at Gu Tian Shu, puzzled why they were alive while the five had been annihilated.

“Did you notice? The five elders who died were two from the Ming Clan, two from the Fei Clan, and one from the Hun Tian Clan!” Sun Shengtian furrowed his brows, addressing Luo Tian and others.

“You mean Gu Tian Shu is trying to intimidate us? We’ve already killed two of their royal heirs and saint sons, creating an unbreakable enmity. There’s no room for reconciliation. So he killed them forcefully?” Diao Yuanshan and others wore confusion.

“It’s likely correct. But I’m curious why Grandfather, with such formidable power, didn’t annihilate all of them but left nine! Does he fear something?” Luo Tian muttered, his eyes filled with confusion as he gazed at Gu Tian Shu.

Fu Wenbin and Old Jin Wu remained silent, watching the three clans’ epoch elders die. They vaguely guessed Gu Tian Shu’s actions, knowing their own ancient tribes’ strength.

“Alright, the remaining people have no more. Now we can talk!” Gu Tian Shu smiled, gazing at the nine surviving elders.

“Although we lost, we are merely your first obstacle. The ancient tribes also have royal weapons. These weapons are controlled by more ancient figures within our clan. I believe these strong ones will arrive with the royal weapons tomorrow or the day after. That’s when your human clan faces its true crisis,” Fu Wenbin spoke softly, revealing the ancient tribes’ secrets.

Among the ancient tribes, the Star-Moon Divine Clan had the least hostility toward the human clan due to their relationship with Luo Tian.

Hearing Fu Wenbin’s words, the human clan inhaled sharply. They hadn’t expected these dozen elders to be merely the first wave.

“Could there be a provisional king?” Luo Tian and others felt a shadow over their hearts, gazing at Gu Tian Shu.

A provisional epoch lord—Luo Tian and others had never seen one. Though they didn’t know Gu Tian Shu’s cultivation, they knew he was definitely not an epoch peak elder; otherwise, he wouldn’t have single-handedly suppressed nine elders.

“If true provisional kings emerge, how can we resist?” Everyone’s hearts were heavy.

Chapter 1471: Provisional King

Upon hearing the peak elders’ words, Gu Tian Shu furrowed his brows slightly but soon relaxed. He sat cross-legged beneath the starry sky, seemingly adjusting his state.

Fu Wenbin and others did not continue speaking but returned to the ancient tribes, calming their people.

Zhong Zixuan flew down from the starry sky to Luo Tian’s group. Though his body was battered, his aura had not significantly declined. His eyes still bore a hint of concern.

“Don’t worry; we have preparations,” he sighed, addressing Luo Tian’s group.

Hearing Zhong Zixuan’s words, the people’s pressure did not ease much. Instead, they respectfully gazed at Gu Tian Shu.

At this moment, the human clan’s only hope was Gu Tian Shu. If he fell, a provisional king could easily crush the entire nine regions. Thus, even if the human clan did not perish, it would inevitably fall to a lower status than the ancient tribes.

In short, the human clan’s survival now hinged entirely on Gu Tian Shu.

Time slowly passed. Under the black starry sky, the human clan remained unusually tense, their eyes fixed on the depths of the雷域 (Thunder Region), not daring to relax even slightly, hoping to see what kind of power the ancient tribes possessed.

“Boom… Boom…” After waiting for two days, thunderous sounds echoed in the starry sky of the雷域. People’s gazes became even more tense.

From within the thunder, three imposing figures emerged as if divine beings. Their faces bore cold expressions.

“This is the aura of the nine regions!” The three elders wore a look of ecstasy, deeply inhaling before scanning their gazes over the group.

“This…” When they scanned Luo Tian’s group, all human clans trembled as if knives were scraping their bodies.

“Buzz…” Several epoch treasures emitted radiant light, enveloping the human clan’s heads.

“Unexpectedly, the human clan has developed to such an extent!” The three elders stepped forward toward the ancient tribes’ front, their eyes filled with smiles as they gazed at the epoch treasures hovering above Luo Tian’s group.

“Buzz…” However, the next moment, they waved their hands. An immense aura radiated from their heads.

“This is the royal weapon of the Hun Tian Clan, the Hun Tian Tower!”

“This is the Fei Clan’s divine robe!”

“This is the Star-Moon Divine Clan’s Star-Moon Divine Spear!” The tribes’ people wore fervent expressions, gazing at the three items radiating overwhelming power. They fell to their knees in reverence, as if bowing to a king.

“Since the three of you have arrived, may we sit down and talk?” Gu Tian Shu slowly stood up, gazing at the three elders with a soft voice.

“Talk? What qualifications do you have to talk?” The three elders wore a hint of disdain, addressing Gu Tian Shu.

“What qualifications do you think would allow us to talk?” Gu Tian Shu maintained his smile, gazing at the three elders.

“You human clans are a lowly race. You are our vassal clan!” The three elders wore an assertive demeanor, not looking at Gu Tian Shu. Their strength was supreme in any era; they were provisional kings, just one step away from enlightenment.

“Honor the three provisional kings!” Fu Wenbin and others wore expressions of reverence, bowing to the three elders with the tribes.

“You are truly incompetent. With so many people, you couldn’t even eliminate one provisional epoch lord!” The three elders wore dissatisfaction, gazing at Fu Wenbin and others before softly scolding them.

“Indeed!” Hearing the three provisional kings’ words, everyone—human clans included—wore expressions of shock, gazing at Gu Tian Shu.

“Provisional epoch lord!” Though people had prepared for it, hearing the ancient tribes’ provisional kings say it still shocked them.

“Countless epoch lords have emerged from our human clan. Yet the kings come from your ancient tribes. If we compare nobility, perhaps our human clan is more noble!” Gu Tian Shu maintained his smile, gazing at the three provisional kings.

“That’s because your human clan is treacherous. You stole the epoch book from us, otherwise you wouldn’t have risen!” Hearing Gu Tian Shu’s words, the three provisional kings’ faces darkened.

They were all formidable. In any era, they would be invincible. Now facing Gu Tian Shu, they had no fear.

“Then it’s only one battle left. Let us fight for a peaceful world!” Gu Tian Shu sighed, standing up slowly. His gaze remained calm as he looked at the three.

“Ha! You are strong, but we three are your equals. Do you intend to fight us alone?” The three provisional kings laughed coldly, their auras rising.

“Come then. We also wish to see what qualifications the human clan now has to challenge us, the ancient tribes!” The three provisional kings’ auras surged. Their bodies moved swiftly toward Gu Tian Shu.

Gu Tian Shu showed no fear, his body emitting a series of thunderous roars. He punched forward, instantly clashing with the three provisional kings.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sound was deafening. Gu Tian Shu fought three at once, his punches radiating immense power and swallowing the heavens.

The three provisional kings were equally formidable. Each punch seemed to pierce through everything, radiating ultimate power.

The void shattered as four figures collided rapidly. Even Luo Tian and others could not see their movements clearly, only witnessing the stars continuously exploding with thunderous sounds echoing in all directions of the starry sky.

“What if Grandfather faces problems?” Gu Lei and others wore intense concern, gazing at the four figures who seemed to have shattered time itself. They listened to the heart-stirring thunderous sounds, voicing their concerns.

To them, Gu Tian Shu was undeniably invincible. But the enemy were three provisional kings—equals to Gu Tian Shu.

“Roar…” The tribes roared, their faces filled with excitement. Previously, the ancient tribes’ young talents had been suppressed by the human clan. Even when peak elders fought, they were crushed by Gu Tian Shu and Zhong Zixuan’s sudden emergence. This had made the ancient tribes, who looked down on the human clan, unable to accept it.

Now, with the three provisional kings’ arrival, the ancient tribes had finally vented their frustration.
