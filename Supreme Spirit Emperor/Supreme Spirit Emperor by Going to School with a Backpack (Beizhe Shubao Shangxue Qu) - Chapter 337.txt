The hall, though dilapidated, exuded a divine aura. It would not endure much longer before succumbing to time's erosion, its corridors echoing with desolation. The wind howled through the ruined structures, producing mournful wails as if malevolent spirits were shrieking.

As Luo Tian stepped into the hall, a mournful cry erupted in his ears. Within the decaying edifice sat a frail figure, its emaciated form seemingly ready to be scattered by the wind.

"Still alive!" Luo Tian's expression shifted as he sensed it, then retreated. This Jietian Mountain was permeated with sinister energy, not a place of inheritance but a graveyard.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian retreated, the withered figure exploded instantly, its body devoid of vitality or blood.

A wisp of gray mist emerged from the scattered bones, forming a spectral figure that lunged at Luo Tian with a roar.

"Who are you?" Luo Tian's gaze darkened as he barked, summoning seven-colored flames to envelop himself.

"You are Jun Moshang... why are you still so young? Have you transcended?" The gray spirit howled, its voice laced with bitter resentment.

"I am not Jun Moshang!" Luo Tian sneered, suspecting this was another ancient power sealed by Jietian's master. He extended his hand, and seven-colored flames surged toward the spectral entity.

Yet this spirit was more advanced than Minglin's. The gray spirit roared, raising its hand to unleash a wave of gray mist that condensed into a colossal gray sun, crushing Luo Tian.

"I'll send you to your grave!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination as he unleashed another surge of seven-colored flames, engulfing the gray sun in a fiery inferno.

"Damn it... I hate this..." The gray spirit dissolved into the flames, its final breaths filled with resentment.

"Once great heroes, now reduced to this—trapped on Jietian Mountain, forgotten by the world!" Luo Tian sighed, gazing at crystalline bones on the ground. They remained unscathed by Xiaoqi's flames, indicating they were from an epoch peak.

Though such bones were treasures, Luo Tian chose not to collect them but to bury them respectfully. To reach an epoch peak was no small feat, and this was a tribute to the strong.

Luo Tian pressed on, reaching the mountain's midsection. He halted, his expression darkening.

"The path is broken!" His brow furrowed, confusion in his gaze. He refused to fly, unsure of Jietian's master's traps—haste could cost him his life.

"Boom..." Luo Tian summoned a gray tablet before him.

"Let's test it!" He waved his hands, sending strings of runes into the tablet.

"Boom..." The gray tablet expanded violently, rising to form a bridge over the broken path.

"Will it work?" Luo Tian's brow furrowed, eyeing the seemingly endless chasm.

"It should. This place likely blocks those without a tablet—without it, one cannot cross. It's a trial!" Luo Tian resolved, then stepped onto the bridge.

"Ahh..." As he crossed halfway, mournful cries echoed from below, puzzling him.

"Never mind! Probably another spirit!" Luo Tian steeled himself; he feared no spirits, not even those of epoch peak.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian advanced, a cacophony of roars filled his ears.

"Rustle..." Gray water sounds echoed, prompting him to glance downward.

Below the chasm, gray faces swam in the river, their expressions grotesque.

"It's the River of Death!" Luo Tian quickly averted his gaze, steadying himself on the bridge.

The River of Death—Luo Tian had encountered it before, but this one was far more formidable.

"Path of the righteous is littered with bones!" Luo Tian sighed, recalling how Jun Moshang's ascension had birthed this river during the ancient clans' extermination of humanity.

"Come down and join us!" Cries echoed in his ears, as if under a spell. His soul nearly drifted from his body.

"Return!" Luo Tian bit his tongue, clearing his mind. His twin Reincarnation Immortal Bodies radiated white light, their aura impervious to all.

"Is this a trial?" Luo Tian mused, stepping forward toward the chasm's end.

"Nothing too bad," he thought, his gaze contemplative—this trial was no simple test.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian pondered, the tablet beneath his feet hummed, causing his expression to shift.

Gray mist rose from the tablet, forming runes that danced across its surface.

Suddenly, the tablet emitted a terrifying suction, drawing the River of Death's waters toward Luo Tian.

"Roar..." Soul fragments swarmed him, making his spirit tremble.

"Gods, am I blessed?" Luo Tian's face darkened as countless soul fragments lunged at him.

"Xiaoqi, come out and burn these!" He touched his forehead, releasing Xiaoqi.

"Ahh..." But as soon as he did, Xiaoqi's face quivered before shrinking into a flame mark on his forehead.

"Damn it, I'm your father!" Luo Tian was stunned; Xiaoqi had never backed down before.

"Didn't you transcend the Heavenly Flame, becoming a potential epoch master?" Luo Tian's heart trembled.

"Buzz..." He summoned pure epoch energy to repel the souls.

"Fear... if I destroy them, I'll lose consciousness!" Xiaoqi's fragmented voice echoed in his mind.

"You're really a traitor!" Luo Tian sighed, surprised by Xiaoqi's failure.

Yet he bore no resentment; the River of Death was too powerful. Though Xiaoqi was formidable, destroying it would drain him beyond his limits.

"Brace yourself!" Luo Tian moved, dashing toward the chasm's end while soul fragments battered his barrier.

"Rustle..." Gray soul waves crashed relentlessly, leaving no respite.

After a dozen breaths, Luo Tian halted, his eyes blazing with determination.

"Something's wrong! Jietian's master must have foreseen this—there must be a way out!" He mused.

"Moreover, my current state can't pass this trial," he observed, noting his barrier had vanished. His mind raced.

As he glanced around, he noticed the gray tablet beneath his feet. Its intricate patterns danced, and realization struck him.

"Great opportunity! Crisis brings great fortune—this saying holds true!" Luo Tian's face twisted with madness, ignoring the shattered barrier and sitting cross-legged on the bridge.

"Buzz..." His body radiated waves, unimpeded by the soul fragments rushing toward him.

Chapter 1368: Yang Fish Shakes the Ancient Coffin

On the gray bridge, Luo Tian closed his eyes as if oblivious to danger. His body radiated waves, ignoring the soul fragments attacking him.

"Buzz..." A wave of invisible energy spread from his body, forming a vortex that engulfed the gray souls.

"Ahh..." A low roar echoed from the souls, sending shivers down his spine. Yet closer inspection revealed their cries were filled with anguish.

"Reincarnation Heaven Skill!" Luo Tian's technique was the answer he'd deduced from the tablet. He noticed its swirling patterns mirrored the Reincarnation Heaven Skill's flow, which had drawn the River of Death.

Though dangerous, these souls held immense power—exactly what he needed to forge his second Reincarnation Immortal Body, and possibly a third. This would elevate him to the epoch's middle stage.

Yet he understood the peril: his soul must not be corrupted, and his resolve must remain unshaken.

His ten years of mortal life had been his safeguard—though he'd trained no longer, he'd once slain a Crimson Rainbow Gang member with a single shot. That was the stability of his heart.

Luo Tian was certain no one in the Nine Realms matched his resolve, save for Guzu and Jiang Nanxuan.

The Reincarnation Heaven Skill surged, devouring souls rapidly. The River of Death churned into a vast gray vortex, faces contorting within it.

Pure epoch energy emerged from the skill, flowing into his dantian. The ethereal Reincarnation Immortal Body solidified gradually.

Meanwhile, his mind was haunted by countless faces—grimacing, howling at him like a horde of ghosts.

"Come with me..."

"I'm innocent! Why kill me?" Their cries echoed relentlessly, even testing Luo Tian's will.

Time passed slowly; the vortex hovered over his head for an hour, leaving him pale and bloodied.

At last, the Reincarnation Immortal Body formed in his dantian. He opened his eyes with a triumphant grin.

"Go away..." He roared, expelling the million souls' wills from his mind.

"Not enough! Ten years of no progress, but my peers must have advanced. I can't fall behind!" His eyes darkened with resolve, sitting cross-legged again.

He knew his current state was unfit for further soul absorption. Though the souls were mindless, they sensed danger. Even the tablet's patterns faded, seemingly approving his trial completion.

Yet Luo Tian couldn't let this chance slip. Ten years of no progress, but he knew: stagnation meant regression. If others advanced while he didn't, he'd lose his edge against true prodigies.

Though confident in his combat power, facing a top-tier genius could still be risky.

Ten years of mortal life had been carefree but unstable. He didn't know what the Nine Realms were like, or if ancient clans had entered it. He feared what awaited him outside.

Only by maximizing his strength could he face any crisis.

"Let it solidify!" He sat cross-legged, reigniting the Reincarnation Heaven Skill to devour more souls.

"Rustle..." The gray waves surged again, faces howling with fury as they were devoured.

Time passed; more souls transformed into pure epoch energy, filling his dantian. His third Reincarnation Immortal Body began to form.

After half a day, the River of Death's waters had visibly dropped. Luo Tian spat blood, his eyes vacant before stopping.

Gray mist danced in his gaze—laughter, confusion, a soulless expression with myriad emotions.

"Ahh..." A fire dragon roared within his body, its cries echoing from his open mouth. His eyes cleared instantly.

"Close call!" Luo Tian wiped sweat, gently touching the seven-colored flame mark on his forehead. A smile crossed his lips: "I didn't raise you in vain!"

"Ahh..." Xiaoqi's voice echoed in his mind, discontent.

"Epoch advancement is truly arduous!" Luo Tian muttered, awe in his voice as he felt his two half-formed Reincarnation Immortal Bodies.

"Who knows their current strength? I hope I haven't fallen too far behind," he mused, stepping toward the chasm's end.

Moments later, he entered the clifftop, where a towering palace awaited. Unlike before, this one radiated power, untouched by time. Its integrity was maintained by some secret means.

Luo Tian's expression darkened as he entered, scanning the hall with solemnity. Upon entry, his spiritual sense spread, revealing the scene instantly.

Golden flames flickered around the hall, their heat searing his soul. He furrowed his brow.

"Someone was here before?" He noticed footprints on the dust-covered floor, chaotic and fresh.

"Fresh prints—just stepped!" He muttered, excitement in his gaze.

"It must be the other two with tablets. Who could it be?" He wandered, spotting an altar at the center. The footprints circled it before heading to the altar's heart.

"Friend or foe?" His gaze deepened; this hall had been scoured by previous visitors, leaving nothing.

"Damn it, they took everything!" He grumbled, scouring the hall before stepping onto the altar.

"Buzz..." A familiar teleportation force enveloped him, vanishing from the hall.

As he materialized, a thunderous roar echoed in his soul, startling him.

"Boom..." The sound reverberated; a massive ancient coffin stood at the hall's center, its lid crowned by a golden sun radiating ultimate light.

A plump figure sat atop the coffin, serene yet solemn, eyes closed. The coffin trembled, black mist seeping from its seams, as if the figure restrained it.

Luo Tian's soul quaked at the black mist's power, feeling its overwhelming pressure.

"Recognize it?" He stared at the figure, realization dawning.

"Sun... Ke... Nian!" He spoke slowly, disbelief in his voice, eyes wide.

"Correct!" His gaze locked on the golden sun atop Sun Kienian's head, confirming it was the Yang Fish from the Divine and Demon Dao Map.

"How did he end up here?" Luo Tian's mind reeled, stunned to find Sun Kienian here.

As Luo Tian entered the hall, Sun Kienian opened his eyes, staring at him in shock.

"Luo Tian! You... you're alive!"

Chapter 1369: You Buried My Grave

"Who are you?" Both Luo Tian and Sun Kienian spoke simultaneously, bewildered. They hadn't expected to meet here after years apart.

Sun Kienian was about to ask more, but the coffin erupted with black mist, his face paling.

"Stop talking! Help me contain this coffin!" Sun Kienian urged, urgency in his voice.

"Refuse!" Luo Tian shook his head, fear in his eyes. The black mist's power was immense; even a breath could crush him.

"Brothers of the Nine Realms, help!" Sun Kienian clung to the coffin's lid, desperate.

"Grave robbers! How did you end up here? You don't know what this place is, do you?" Luo Tian scoffed, eyes on the Yang Fish.

"Lo! You're still watching—back then you took almost everything I owned. Now I'm in this mess, yet you won't help? How do you honor my treasures?" Sun Kienian roared.

"Cut the crap! If it weren't for your fake identity leading to my chase, I wouldn't be here!" Luo Tian scoffed, scanning the hall.

"Don't look! I've already searched everything—nothing's left!" Sun Kienian glared.

"Ah, that explains the previous hall's plundered look!" Luo Tian nodded, his gaze on Sun Kienian.

"Wow, your treasure collection's impressive—how long has it been?" He eyed Sun Kienian's gear.

"Stop! I've already searched everything!" Sun Kienian warned, his body trembling at Luo Tian's gaze.

"Hey, Brother Sun, we're from the Nine Realms, right? You see how poor I am—give me something!" Luo Tian grinned, leaping onto Sun Kienian's head.

"I have nothing! These halls were already searched!" Sun Kienian gritted his teeth.

"Don't let me find out who went before me! If I do, I'll dig up their ancestors!" Sun Kienian growled.

"Boom..." As they spoke, the coffin rumbled again, Sun Kienian's face pale.

"Brother Sun, I'll take my leave!" Luo Tian trembled, heading for the exit.

"Brother Lo, wait!" Sun Kienian called, his face ashen.

"What else is there? We're both from the Nine Realms—your grudge against me was enough!" Luo Tian turned, addressing Sun Kienian.

"It's not that! I have a gift for you—please help!" Sun Kienian waved, tossing a green ring to Luo Tian.

"What's this?" Luo Tian eyed the ring, sensing its uniqueness.

"It's a ring worn by the Divine and Demon Master—its inner world is far superior to storage rings!" Sun Kienian winced.

"Wow, he's even entered the Divine and Demon Master's tomb!" Luo Tian marveled, taking the ring.

"Brother Sun, you know I'm poor—this gift deserves more than emptiness!" He clutched the ring, no intention of returning it.

"Brother Lo, I'm not rich either!" Sun Kienian sighed, knowing he'd lose a piece of himself. But if the coffin's contents escaped, he'd be first to die.

"Take this!" Sun Kienian removed a Buddhist bead necklace, tossing it to Luo Tian.

"Brother Lo, I lack weapons!"

"Take it... take it..." Sun Kienian waved, watching his treasures fall into Luo Tian's hands.

"Buzz..." A golden light flashed from Sun Kienian's hand, causing Luo Tian to shift.

A clamor echoed; a golden spear flew toward him, landing in his grasp. Luo Tian's eyes lit up.

"Crack the Heavens Spear!" He recognized it, his gaze darkening at Sun Kienian.

"Did you go to the Tianyuan Continent?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness, a hint of killing intent.

"Ah..." Sun Kienian inwardly cursed; he should've checked first. The killing intent unnerved him.

"What did you do in the Tianyuan Continent?" Luo Tian caressed the spear, his tone softening.

"I..." Sun Kienian hesitated, eyes darting.

"Buzz..." The spear hummed, and images flooded Luo Tian's mind—
A statue stood in the Five Elements Sect's back mountain, its form unmistakably Luo Tian.

"A burial mound?" Luo Tian chuckled, sadness in his voice. He hadn't expected the Tianyuan Continent's people to believe him dead.

Yet another image enraged him, his gaze turning playful toward Sun Kienian.

"Brother Sun, you dug up my burial mound?" His voice was dark, making Sun Kienian uneasy.

Though he was alive, being dug up stung him.

"Um... Brother Lo, it's a misunderstanding—I was just curious. It's my habit!" Sun Kienian rubbed his hands, apologizing.

"Ah, I saw several pseudo-epoch treasures in my burial mound—where are they?" Luo Tian nodded, not continuing. He weighed the spear.

"Damn it, Brother Lo..." Sun Kienian nearly wept; this was extortion. The burial mound had only the spear, nothing else.

"I'll go first, Brother Sun!" Luo Tian stood, preparing to leave.

"Take it!" Sun Kienian gritted his teeth, tossing a storage ring to Luo Tian.

"Ah!" Luo Tian scanned it, satisfaction in his eyes. He nodded at Sun Kienian.

"Since Brother Sun showed such sincerity, I won't hold it against you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, approaching Sun Kienian.

"How can I help?" His tone was grave; he wasn't truly leaving. The coffin's contents, if released, would be deadly for him too.

"What's in the coffin?" Luo Tian asked, confusion in his gaze.

"A demon!" Sun Kienian trembled, fear in his eyes. He regretted it deeply.

"You..." Luo Tian was speechless; it must be his habit—seeing a coffin, he had to open it.

"Let's contain it first!" Sun Kienian felt awkward, sitting cross-legged again, radiating solemnity.

"Fine," Luo Tian knew this wasn't the time to scold Sun Kienian. He sat on the coffin, his three Reincarnation Immortal Bodies surging with runes that bound the ancient coffin.

"Boom..." With Luo Tian's help, the coffin lid finally stilled. The Yang Fish above radiated ultimate power, suppressing the ancient coffin.

Time passed; the coffin stilled, no longer emitting powerful waves. Luo Tian opened his eyes, exhaling deeply.

"Brother Lo, I'll go first!" Sun Kienian appeared at the hall's entrance, smiling.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing Sun Kienian's hidden meaning. Before he could react, Sun Kienian vanished.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian's gaze was puzzled, a bad feeling stirring—Sun Kienian had definitely planned something.

Chapter 1370: The Entity Beneath the Ancient Coffin

"Boom..." As Luo Tian pondered, a thunderous roar erupted beneath him.

"Damn it!" The immense pressure made him shiver, and he sat on the coffin lid.

"Sun Kienian, you bastard! You tricked me!" He finally understood why Sun Kienian had fled so fast. Though they'd subdued the coffin, it was only temporary. Now alone, he had to replace Sun Kienian's role.

Unlike before, the coffin now radiated white light, its aura terrifying. Luo Tian felt fear.

"Back then, you threw me into the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave—I remember! Don't worry; if you fully contain it, it'll hold!" Sun Kienian's voice echoed in his ears.

"Brother Lo, let's talk!" Luo Tian roared at the hall's entrance but received no reply.

"Boom... Boom..." The copper coffin lid trembled, a bitter smile on Luo Tian's lips.

"Sun Kienian, wait for me!" He roared, then resumed containment.

"Get out of me!" A deep voice echoed from the coffin, startling Luo Tian. He felt its familiarity but remained vigilant.

"I won't harm you!" The voice continued, authoritative.

"Don't dream it!" Luo Tian ignored it, his three immortal bodies surging with runes to bind the coffin.

"Kid, you don't recognize me?" The voice was deep, making Luo Tian feel a strange familiarity.

"I am Dongbo Xin!" The entity inside the coffin spoke, confirming his identity.

"What..." Luo Tian nearly fell from the lid, disbelief in his eyes.

"I am Dongbo Xin!" The voice repeated, making Luo Tian's body tremble.

"Senior..." He finally recognized the voice and leaped off the coffin, bowing respectfully.

Luo Tian hadn't expected to meet Dongbo Xin here—a superpower. If he was present, his safety would be greatly assured. Dongbo Xin could enter even a master's epoch array.

Luo Tian had met many epoch peak masters, but none matched Dongbo Xin's strength except the mysterious blind old man Ji Jiu You. Star Moon Sect's Grand Master was also epoch peak, but Luo Tian felt he'd lose against Dongbo Xin in a fight.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian leaped off the coffin, it lifted violently, light sweeping across. A tall figure emerged from the coffin, radiating golden light. His eyes held both yin and yang, black and white energy swirling within.

"Boom..." Dongbo Xin landed on the ground, the coffin lid closing.

"Bow to you, Senior!" Luo Tian bowed, relief in his eyes.

"Ah, why are you here?" Dongbo Xin nodded, asking.

"I don't know—this tablet brought me here!" Luo Tian shook his head.

"This place is dangerous; I sense a threat," Dongbo Xin's eyes gleamed, his aura radiating battle readiness.

"Senior, your situation?" Luo Tian's face darkened; if even Dongbo Xin felt danger, it was beyond his capacity.

"I've been here for years. If not for you and that kid awakening me, I might have perished in this coffin!" Dongbo Xin's eyes showed caution.

"What kind of coffin is this, that even a senior like you nearly lost?" Luo Tian was stunned. Dongbo Xin was his invincible hero, yet here he faced this crisis.
