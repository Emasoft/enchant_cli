“However, don’t rush. First, reduce the human clan’s casualties!” Luo Tian withdrew and rushed toward Yang Jinghua, who was desperately holding his ground. He spoke softly: “Brother Yang, the soul of the beast is mine!”

“Damn it! It’s you again!” The Tengu sensed Luo Tian approaching and his face darkened. At that moment, he knew Luo Tian’s restraint was immense; even figures like Fu Xingyue and Tu Feiyang could barely counter him. But their tribe’s greatest strength lay in their physical bodies, and Luo Tian showed no fear. Worse still, the Tengu’s seventh step of cultivation allowed them to reach the fifth level, while this first prodigy of the Tengu Temple could only manage the fourth—utterly humiliating.

“Ah…” As Luo Tian flew, a piercing scream echoed in his mind, causing him to falter.

“Shen Gong Fei Chi!” Luo Tian’s divine awareness suddenly located Shen Gong Fei Chi, his eyes cold.

At that moment, Shen Gong Fei Chi was in a pitiful state. His plump body was drenched in blood, his eyes vacant and lifeless.

Around him lay a field of corpses, saturated with blood. Several Tengu giants stared at Shen Gong Fei Chi with ferocious eyes.

“Everyone is dead!” Shen Gong Fei Chi whispered, as if he hadn’t noticed the people around him.

Though Shen Gong Fei Chi’s status wasn’t high, due to Luo Tian’s influence, Yang Jinghua had assigned several people to protect him. Plus, Shen Gong Fei Chi’s nature made it likely for unexpected events in the battlefield.

Indeed, the incident came swiftly. When the Tongtian Array crushed the Tengu forces, Shen Gong Fei Chi was stunned by the overwhelming bloodstained atmosphere. He trembled uncontrollably, his first encounter with such a brutal scene. Each Tengu giant was crushed like wheat under the array.

After the Tongtian Array collapsed, Shen Gong Fei Chi remained stunned. The people assigned to protect him chose to safeguard him instead.

Shen Gong Fei Chi was stunned, but the Tengu weren’t. Chaos inevitably reached him. Yet Shen Gong Fei Chi was passive; if not for those who fearlessly protected him, he might have already perished.

“Everyone is dead… everyone is dead. I was with Brother Wang last night, and chatted with Li Er yesterday—everyone is gone!” Shen Gong Fei Chi whispered, gazing at his blood-stained hands, a look of anguish on his face.

Three Tengu giants stared at the stunned Shen Gong Fei Chi and roared, their fists as large as millstones, slamming toward him.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He regretted bringing Shen Gong Fei Chi here; Shen Gong Fei Chi’s intention was good, to let him train. But sometimes, too intense training could easily break a person.

Luo Tian’s sigh echoed as the Tengu warrior who had thrown a fist at Shen Gong Fei Chi shattered into a mist of blood, splattering onto Shen Gong Fei Chi’s body.

“Shen Gong Fei Chi, this is the battlefield! Either you die or I perish!” Luo Tian soared forward and gently patted Shen Gong Fei Chi’s shoulder.

Shen Gong Fei Chi’s plump body trembled violently. Hearing Luo Tian’s voice, he was struck by lightning; his eyes suddenly turned blood-red.

“I will avenge!” Shen Gong Fei Chi slowly rose, his aura shifting dramatically. A deep rumbling echoed from within him as his power gradually ascended. An invisible wave of energy rose around him, as if something within him had awakened.

“Ah!” Shen Gong Fei Chi roared, his body transforming into an invisible vortex. The thick blood qi around him suddenly condensed and rushed toward his body.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s eyes shifted sharply. He felt Shen Gong Fei Chi had changed, a chill rising in his heart.

At the end of the blood-red path stood a single deep red drop of blood, hovering on an altar. As Shen Gong Fei Chi roared skyward, the blood’s powerful aura trembled violently, as if summoned by something. It emitted a loud hum and vanished from the altar.

The blood vortex entered Shen Gong Fei Chi’s body, causing Luo Tian to frown. He wasn’t sure whether to stop it.

“Soul-Devouring Qi!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened, sensing the growing intensity of Shen Gong Fei Chi’s soul-devouring qi. His gaze carried a hint of worry.

Luo Tian had once struggled with soul-devouring qi, so he knew its terror. How could he watch Shen Gong Fei Chi tread the same path he had taken?

“Come out!” Luo Tian roared, channeling his Epoch Power into a holy hand that appeared above Shen Gong Fei Chi. A powerful suction emanated from the pure white hand.

“Why?” Everyone felt Shen Gong Fei Chi’s change, their eyes filled with shock.

The Seven Star Island people recognized Shen Gong Fei Chi—the lively, cowardly fat man. But now, his wild demeanor made him seem like a different person entirely, drenched in blood as countless blood qi poured into his body.

Yet just as Luo Tian’s Epoch hand formed, a single deep red drop of blood fell from the sky. An overwhelming aura and pressure instantly landed on Luo Tian, shattering his hand that sought to stop Shen Gong Fei Chi from absorbing the blood qi.

Fine red cracks formed on Shen Gong Fei Chi’s body. Seeing the deep red drop, he opened his mouth and inhaled it without resistance; it instantly entered his body.

“This is the essence of the Blood Lord Tu Tian!” Luo Tian felt a familiar aura within the deep red drop.

The deep red essence was directly swallowed by Shen Gong Fei Chi, and immediately, a terrifying aura surged from his body. His blood qi soared skyward, and the fine red cracks on his body vanished instantly.

“What’s going on? The Blood Lord’s inheritance chose Shen Gong Fei Chi?” People looked puzzled, stunned by the scene.

“This is my inheritance! Give it back!” Fu Xingyue’s face darkened. He formed a crescent moon with one hand and a star with the other, charging toward Shen Gong Fei Chi.

“You’re nothing!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly. He stood before Shen Gong Fei Chi, guarding him as he punched out two fists that collided with the moon and star. The explosion rose but did not affect Shen Gong Fei Chi at all.

Luo Tian didn’t know if Shen Gong Fei Chi’s change was good or bad. Since the Blood Lord Tu Tian’s inheritance had chosen him, there was no need to fight over it. He would not only avoid conflict but also ensure Shen Gong Fei Chi’s safety.

“Eternal Restraint!”

“Instant Movement!” As Luo Tian deflected Fu Xingyue’s attack, a cold voice echoed in Fu Xingyue’s ears.

“Ugh…” A groan sounded as a gray aura pierced time, instantly entering Fu Xingyue’s body.

“You underestimated me. Fighting against me and still distracted!” Hu Tianzong appeared before Fu Xingyue, his gray spear piercing into Fu Xingyue’s heart.

“You!” Fu Xingyue’s face paled, his eyes filled with disbelief. He bit down and pulled the gray spear from his chest.

“Go!” Fu Xingyue spat a mist of blood, and the Star Moon Spear roared forth before exploding, piercing through space. Fu Xingyue didn’t hesitate; he leapt into the rift.

“This grudge I’ll remember. When my Star Moon Clan’s forces arrive, we’ll flatten your Seven Star Island!” His low roar carried deep resentment through the fading light and cracks.

“Damn it! All Tengu retreat!” Seeing Fu Xingyue and Fan Jingyu’s escape, the Tengu leader knew their defeat was certain.

“Yes!” The Tengu giants obeyed despite reluctance. Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong, both at the early Epoch stage, filled them with despair.

The Tengu leader struck Yang Jinghua away and grabbed the fallen Tu Feiyang, who was protected by a bloodlight. He launched the bone-forged wolf spear and commanded it to expand, collapsing space. The Tengu leader was the first to enter the massive rift.

“Go!” The Tengu dragon’s face paled as he entered. Then, Tan Long and Tan Hai followed, knowing the tide had turned. They leapt into the rift.

“Kill!” The Seven Star Island people seemed to have taken a stimulant, chasing after the rift.

Chapter 1281: Return to Seven Star Island

In the blood-red space, a vast rift appeared in the human clan’s view. Vast figures continuously entered it, their destination unknown. Yet the Seven Star Island elite disciples had never felt so exhilarated.

Previously, while both sides clashed, the Tengu often held the advantage. No one expected such a severe reversal. The Tengu’s ten thousand had been killed by three thousand via Luo Tian’s thunder, and now crushed by the Tongtian Ancient Path and previous battles. Only over four thousand remained—half dead. This was an unprecedented achievement in the Sea of Anger battle.

But the fight continued. The Seven Star Island disciples, high-spirited, slaughtered those still escaping into the rift. Corpses lay scattered in the blood-red space.

“Don’t chase into the rift!” Yang Jinghua smiled weakly, falling beside Luo Tian. He issued orders to his valiant people.

Luo Tian extended a hand, channeling Epoch Power into Yang Jinghua’s body. He sighed deeply.

“What’s wrong with this kid?” Hu Tianzong, weakened, approached Luo Tian. The spear that had pierced Fu Xingyue’s heart had cost him dearly.

“This kid’s luck is too good. The inheritance essence just came to him!” Hu Tianzong’s eyes showed envy. He knew Shen Gong Fei Chi had received the Blood Lord Tu Tian’s inheritance and would surely soar.

“Hum…” The humming sound rose as continuous killing caused the Tengu giants to finally enter the rift. The massive crack began to merge slowly.

“I will avenge!” Red light spread as Shen Gong Fei Chi’s low roar echoed. He slowly opened his eyes, a wild look in them as he gazed at the closing rift. His body flashed forward, instantly rushing into the merging crack. Even Luo Tian was too late to react.

A heart-stirring aura made Luo Tian’s face change abruptly. Shen Gong Fei Chi now felt terrifying, as if something terrible had changed.

“Fei Chi!” Luo Tian roared. He felt Shen Gong Fei Chi’s state was wild, as if his mind had been corrupted. This state was dangerous.

Thinking this, Luo Tian flashed forward toward the closing rift, his eyes filled with anxiety. He pushed his speed to its limit.

But the rift closed just as Luo Tian was about to enter, leaving him empty-handed.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian punched the air, causing space to tremble. His white-glowing hand tore at the void barrier.

Gray space appeared in Luo Tian’s view, a repelling aura sending shivers through his mind. Without hesitation, he dove into the void.

Chaos-filled gray mist battered Luo Tian’s body, strong resistance slowing him down.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face turned cold. He looked at the gray space, clenched his fists, and a force pushed him out of the void.

“How is it?” Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong slowly stood up. They had felt Shen Gong Fei Chi’s state was off, but their reactions lagged behind Luo Tian. Plus, they were wounded and hadn’t caught up.

“He’s gone far. The void I entered isn’t the one the Tengu took!” Luo Tian’s face was grim, his eyes cold.

“Shen Gong Fei Chi is lucky. He should be fine!” Hu Tianzong’s eyes showed a bitter smile, trying to comfort Luo Tian.

“Best he’s fine. If Shen Gong Fei Chi dies, I’ll make the entire Tengu pay!” Luo Tian’s cold words sent a shiver through Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong.

“How many people must be killed to have such intense killing intent!” Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong felt震撼, their gazes toward Luo Tian changed.

Though so, the three of them knew Shen Gong Fei Chi likely faced great danger. Even if his cultivation soared to the early Epoch stage, against Tengu leaders like Tu Huan, he would inevitably bleed.

“Clean up the battlefield. Prepare to return to our base!” Yang Jinghua addressed the remaining Seven Star Island disciples.

After this battle, though humans suffered fewer casualties than Tengu, nearly three thousand had died in the Blood Lord Tu Tian’s palace.

The Seven Star Island disciples cleaned up swiftly, finishing within moments.

“Hum…” The humming sound returned as the blood-red ancient path coalesced again, appearing before Luo Tian’s group.

“This must be the exit,” Luo Tian and others didn’t hesitate. They led the remaining humans onto the path.

After walking for an hour on the blood-red path, Luo Tian’s group finally emerged onto the blood-red sea. Then, figures flashed toward their human base.

In the great hall of the human base, Luo Tian, Hu Tianzong, and Yang Jinghua wore deep expressions. Though the battle was won, Luo Tian felt no joy. Shen Gong Fei Chi’s disappearance—his first friend upon arriving at Seven Star Island—left him restless.

“I’ve ordered everyone to search. We’ll notify you immediately if there’s a clue,” Yang Jinghua told Luo Tian.

“No need. You should focus on gathering resources instead. I’ll find him myself. This battle was hard-won!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. He knew Shen Gong Fei Chi wouldn’t be easily found.

After saying this, Luo Tian returned to his quarters and sat cross-legged, beginning to recover from his injuries. After so much fighting, he needed rest.

The next morning, Luo Tian transformed into a long rainbow and vanished from his room. He resumed walking the corners of the Sea of Anger, searching for Shen Gong Fei Chi. Though he knew Shen Gong Fei Chi might no longer be in the Sea of Anger, Luo Tian refused to give up.

His first stop was the Tengu’s base. His vast divine awareness swept through it, but the entire base was empty—no Tengu presence.

“Alas!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, walking through the Tengu’s place. He gazed at the massive buildings and then at a platform resembling the human clan’s teleportation array. However, this Tengu one was far larger.

“Too ancient tribes are unfathomable. Even voids can be traversed!” Luo Tian mused, sensing the teleportation array hadn’t been active for days. Clearly, Tu Huan and others had left via other means.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed. He noticed an unassuming corner with some crude weapons—evidently Tengu-used, as Tu Tian had forcibly pulled both humans and Tengu into the palace. Many Tengu items hadn’t been taken.

The weapons were crude—stone or bone clubs—but some held powerful divine essence. What caught Luo Tian’s attention was a small, unassuming mask among the stones. It seemed not Tengu-used; surrounding it were scattered human weapons, likely Tengu plundered over the years.

“What is this?” Luo Tian felt the mask’s unusual nature. He picked it up, gazing at it. His mind trembled.

One glance revealed the mask’s eye area seemed to emit two cold glows, as if staring at him. Luo Tian shivered.

“What is this?” The chill vanished instantly, leaving Luo Tian calm as he played with the simple blood-red mask.

“Thousand-Transformation Mask!” A message suddenly passed into Luo Tian’s mind, leaving him unsettled.

“Can conceal human aura. Can transform into desired aura?” Luo Tian whispered, his eyes flashing with intensity. He knew the mask’s origin.

“Breaker of Heaven!” Luo Tian’s mind trembled, recalling a story about the first Epoch Master of the human clan in Seven Star Island. This Thousand-Transformation Mask had appeared when the first Epoch Master was young, using its properties to infiltrate ancient tribes and gain the Epoch Book’s approval, eventually becoming an Epoch Master.

“Unexpectedly found a treasure here!” Luo Tian felt shaken. He took the mask, knowing it might be key to finding treasures with nine domains’ aura in the origin domain.

After searching a while without success, Luo Tian left. He continued walking through other corners of the Sea of Anger.

A blink of an eye, seven days passed. Luo Tian had searched for seven days without success.

Luo Tian felt melancholy, returning to the human base. At that moment, Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua, along with humans, had gathered at the teleportation array. Their faces showed smiles—this major victory brought great rewards to Seven Star Island. As for Shen Gong Fei Chi’s death, no one cared much; after all, in battle, people die daily.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian shook his head gently and stood before Yang Jinghua, signaling him to activate the teleportation array.

“Good!” Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong said nothing but understood Luo Tian’s intent. The teleportation array activated, and the humans vanished from the Sea of Anger.

“Rippling…”, as Luo Tian’s group disappeared, the blood-red ocean surged with a massive wave. A plump blood-colored figure plummeted from the void, sinking into the ocean’s depths.

Chapter 1282: Guan Xing Sword Awakens

At Seven Star Island, the Grand Observatory was crowded. The seven island masters wore expectant expressions, standing in the sky, gazing at the Grand Observatory.

Below the observatory, all Seven Star Island disciples watched the massive七星台 with intense eyes. Today was the return day of the Sea of Anger’s people, awaiting their heroes.

“Unknown how this battle in the Sea of Anger went,” Grand Island Master Tong Yangjian whispered, his eyes filled with tension. He longed to know if Luo Tian and others had obtained the Immortal Elixir.

“It should be fine. This time, Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong went; the Tengu must have been caught off guard,” Second Island Master Feng Yong smiled, believing this battle would surely be a Seven Star victory.

“Hum…” The teleportation power radiated from the observatory, sending an overwhelming battle spirit rising. Seven Star disciples shivered instinctively.

“Are they back?” The Seven Star people became excited, eyes fixed on the observatory.

Light flashed. A group of figures appeared in Seven Star disciples’ view. The three leading were Luo Tian, Hu Tianzong, and Yang Jinghua. Their bodies radiated astonishing power, causing the island masters’ gazes to lock.

“Epoch Early Stage!” Tong Yangjian’s eyes brightened, sensing Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong’s aura. He spoke softly.

“Seven Star Island has successors. We can retire!” Several semi-Epoch island masters smiled bitterly, speaking softly.

“Roar…” The roar echoed. An overwhelming battle spirit surged skyward. Behind Luo Tian, seven thousand elite disciples of Seven Star Island smiled but radiated iron-blood intent.

“Finally home! Rest for five years, then return to the Sea of Anger!” Xiang Shaocuan smiled, scanning the crowd for his family.

These people would return after five years of rest to prepare for the ten-year Sea of Anger war.

“This battle was successful. Few casualties!” Tong Yangjian and the seven island masters saw Luo Tian’s group, their smiles deepening.

“Welcome back, heroes of Seven Star Island!” Tong Yangjian and the other island masters flew toward Luo Tian’s group, greeting them.

“Welcome home!” A sea of voices echoed from the observatory below. Seven Star disciples cheered loudly.

“Go! Reunite with your families!” Yang Jinghua smiled, watching the people behind him. These were his life-and-death brothers; some had reached an age where they wouldn’t fight again, freeing them. Most would still follow him for the ten-year war.

“Go!” Each figure rushed toward their relatives and friends, forgetting rules. Tong Yangjian and others weren’t angry; these were all Seven Star heroes.

“Hard work!” Tong Yangjian smiled, addressing Luo Tian’s group.

“Luo Tian, where is Fei Chi?” Shen Gong Fu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s group ears, causing them to pause.

Seeing their expressions, Shen Gong Fu felt a chill. His habitual smile faded.

Shen Gong Fu had sent Shen Gong Fei Chi to the Sea of Anger, seemingly casual but with great resolve. Now that Luo Tian’s group had returned, Shen Gong Fu had waited for Shen Gong Fei Chi’s pig-like scream. But he hadn’t heard it, a bad premonition rising.

“Sorry!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He looked at Shen Gong Fu, speaking softly. He knew Shen Gong Fu had sent Shen Gong Fei Chi to the Sea of Anger partly because of his trust in Luo Tian, believing he could protect Shen Gong Fei Chi.

“Sorry. Shen Gong Fei Chi obtained the Blood Lord Tu Tian’s inheritance, beyond our control! So…” Yang Jinghua also looked apologetic. Shen Gong Fu had personally asked him to watch over Shen Gong Fei Chi.

“Impossible!” Shen Gong Fu’s eyes flashed with light. He moved like a storm toward the third island, not believing Shen Gong Fei Chi had died. He needed to confirm personally.

Shen Gong Fu arrived at a grand hall in the third island instantly. This was where the soul-lamps of the third island’s Saint-level and above were placed.

“Not dead!” Shen Gong Fu breathed heavily, seeing Shen Gong Fei Chi’s soul-lamp flickering. His eyes showed joy.

“Island Master…” Luo Tian and others appeared behind Shen Gong Fu, seeing Shen Gong Fei Chi’s soul-lamp hadn’t gone out. Their eyes also showed joy.

“Tengu!” Luo Tian spoke softly, knowing Shen Gong Fei Chi might now be in the Tengu. Perhaps he was captured by Tu Huan.

“As long as he’s alive!” Luo Tian’s eyes also showed excitement. He sighed inwardly, vowing to find Shen Gong Fei Chi.

“I said this kid has great luck!” Hu Tianzong smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

Tong Yangjian and others sighed deeply. Regardless, Shen Gong Fei Chi was alive—best news. As long as he lived, there was hope; otherwise, they didn’t know what Shen Gong Fu’s anger would bring. They knew how terrifying Shen Gong Fu could be when angry.

“Hmm.” Shen Gong Fu nodded, his gaze still deep but improved. He returned to his usual amiable demeanor.

“Alright, let’s talk about Shen Gong Fei Chi later. First, recount this Sea of Anger journey!” Tong Yangjian, as Grand Island Master, felt this trip might not be simple. Otherwise, Luo Tian’s ability couldn’t have failed to protect Shen Gong Fei Chi.

Hearing Tong Yangjian, Hu Tianzong’s face straightened. He recounted everything from entering the Sea of Anger.

After Hu Tianzong’s account, seven island masters wore solemn expressions. They sensed danger in this Sea of Anger battle.

“Hum…” Luo Tian waved his hand, and purple qi rose in the hall. A strong vitality made everyone stunned.

“Purple Mist Lotus, Immortal Elixir!” Everyone’s breath quickened. They stared at the purple qi-encircled Purple Mist Lotus, eyes filled with excitement. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s group to have truly obtained the Immortal Elixir.

Luo Tian extended his hand, offering the Purple Mist Lotus to Tong Yangjian: “I’ve fulfilled my mission!”

“Thank you!” Tong Yangjian’s eyes showed excitement. He carefully took the Purple Mist Lotus, examining it.

Luo Tian sighed deeply. With the Immortal Elixir, Guan Xing’s crisis would be resolved. It also eased his guilt. With one Immortal Elixir, Seven Star Island would become even more prosperous.

Tong Yangjian and others excitedly took the Purple Mist Lotus toward Guan Xing’s residence. Luo Tian, Hu Tianzong, and Yang Jinghua remained.

“What are your plans next? Not long before Guan Xing wakes. If he learns you exposed his location on the continent, what will he do?” Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong smiled.

Hearing Hu Tianzong, Luo Tian inhaled deeply, his face showing embarrassment: “I’ll leave the island tomorrow to find Shen Gong Fei Chi!”

“Never mind. That guy, though hot-tempered, will forgive you for bringing the Purple Mist Lotus,” Hu Tianzong patted Luo Tian’s shoulder, his eyes showing schadenfreude. He hoped to see Guan Xing suffer.

Luo Tian felt speechless, seeing their smiles. He walked out of the hall helplessly.

“I really look forward to Luo Tian and Guan Xing’s clash!” Hu Tianzong spoke softly, his eyes filled with anticipation.

“I also want to see. These years Guan Xing has been the top of Seven Star Island, unchallenged. Can Luo Tian beat him?” Yang Jinghua nodded in agreement.

“You should focus on entering the Epoch Early Stage. Don’t feel ashamed for falling so far behind?” Hu Tianzong smirked.

Seeing Hu Tianzong’s smugness, Yang Jinghua erupted. But he knew he wasn’t Hu Tianzong’s match and left the hall郁闷.

“Hum…” Luo Tian returned to his quarters, immediately taking out the Thousand-Transformation Mask. His face was serious as he focused on refining it.

The next morning, a sky-shaking sword intent woke up Seven Star Island. A young figure instantly appeared in the island’s sky, eyes filled with excitement, rushing toward Luo Tian’s quarters.

“Guan Xing has recovered!” Seven Star disciples smiled, watching the long rainbow in the sky.

“Ha! A fight is coming. I really want to see who’s stronger!” Hu Tianzong stood in his quarters, eyes filled with anticipation.

Yang Jinghua also slowly opened his eyes, standing on the second island. His gaze turned to Luo Tian’s quarters on the third.

“Has he arrived? Timing is perfect!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a divine light. He had just refined the Thousand-Transformation Mask and placed it away. He stepped out of his courtyard, watching Guan Xing land in the yard.

At this moment, Guan Xing radiated an overwhelming aura. Compared to his previous withered state, he was a complete contrast—like a brilliant sword standing there. His aura exuded arrogance, his eyes deep as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Brother Guan! Hello!” Luo Tian smiled, bowing to Guan Xing.

“You are Luo Tian?” Guan Xing scrutinized Luo Tian. Seeing him nod, he then knelt to the ground before Luo Tian’s astonished gaze.

Chapter 1283: Tragedy

Luo Tian was stunned, watching Guan Xing kneel. He was momentarily speechless. He had expected a battle but received this instead.

“What do you mean?” Luo Tian quickly helped Guan Xing up, sighing inwardly.

“Thank you for saving my life!” Guan Xing was helped up, his eyes filled with gratitude. He bowed to Luo Tian.

“I’ve heard about it. While I was injured, you used your Reincarnation Blood to sustain me and went into the Sea of Anger to find the Purple Mist Lotus. We had no connection, but you treated me so kindly. I Guan Xing am not someone who forgets gratitude!” Guan Xing spoke resolutely, his eyes filled with respect toward Luo Tian.

“From now on, my life is yours. If you have any commands, I will face fire and water without hesitation! Please accept my three bows!” Guan Xing said, then bowed thrice to Luo Tian.

“What the hell is this?” Luo Tian was stunned. He tried to stop Guan Xing, but he had already bowed. His face showed respect as he stood waiting for Luo Tian’s reply.

“This….” Luo Tian was at a loss. His mind drummed; it seemed Seven Star Island could no longer stay.

After thinking for a while, he understood the situation. The island masters must have overlooked his accidental identity as Guan Xing and didn’t want Guan Xing to hate him. Hence, Guan Xing was grateful.

“My god! I didn’t see that right!” Hu Tianzong, observing Luo Tian and Guan Xing’s situation, showed disbelief. He stood in his courtyard, rubbing his eyes.

Yang Jinghua laughed for the first time, his laughter echoing across the second island. The disciples were shocked; they didn’t know why Yang Jinghua, known as the Cold-Faced Judge, had changed so much.

“This is trouble!” Luo Tian sighed bitterly. He knew no secret could stay hidden forever. How many people had known about his accidental identity as Guan Xing? It was impossible to stay hidden.

“These old men, what kind of trouble did they cause?” Luo Tian sighed while smiling gently. He said to Guan Xing: “Brother Guan, no need for this. We are all human clan members; we should help each other. I’ve only done my part!”

“Brother Luo, what are you saying? My master told me you once said even if the Immortal Elixir wasn’t found, you would regularly send Reincarnation Blood to sustain me. I Guan Xing have never served anyone, but now you are the first. I truly respect you!” Guan Xing said and tried to bow again, but Luo Tian stopped him.

At this moment, the courtyard around Luo Tian was filled with people from the third island. Almost everyone wore admiration, gazing at Luo Tian. The first prodigy of Seven Star Island, Guan Xing, was so respectful to their deputy island master.

“Everyone heard it. It’s the deputy island master who, in the Sea of Anger, overpowered four tribes’ prodigies and obtained the Purple Mist Lotus. That’s why Guan Xing survived!” People discussed, their eyes filled with respect toward Luo Tian.

Among them were some people whose mouths twitched. These were the ones who had fought in the Sea of Anger.

“Brother Luo, your life-saving grace is beyond repayment. This is my sword, Star Sword, which I’ve carried for years. It was modeled after the Seven-Star Sword and is stronger than a pseudo-Epoch Treasure. Please accept it!” Guan Xing spoke sincerely, ignoring the strange glances of others, and handed Luo Tian a golden sword.

“I really can’t accept it!” Luo Tian couldn’t take it, immediately pushing it back. His eyes showed a noble refusal.

“You don’t accept it means you look down on me!” Guan Xing understood Luo Tian’s gaze and felt even more grateful. But he was resolute, pushing the Star Sword toward Luo Tian.

“I really can’t accept it! You’ll regret it!”

“No, I must accept it. How could I regret? A man of honor keeps his word!” The two pushed and pulled, but Luo Tian finally gave in to Guan Xing’s persistence. He smiled bitterly while accepting the Star Sword, thinking inwardly: “This is your own choice; don’t blame me!”

“Tragedy!” Hu Tianzong stood in his courtyard, laughing so hard he fell over. He really wanted to see Guan Xing’s expression after learning it was Luo Tian who had exposed his location.
