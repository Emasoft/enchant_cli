“How arrogant! Daring to come alone into the Mortal Domain, and not just once—do you think the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans have no strength?” The news of Luo Tian’s arrival spread like a storm, causing the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans gathered outside the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory to erupt in fury.

“Everyone, this human has shown us no respect. I propose we all strike together and demand the Star Moon Divine Clan hand over this human to be executed publicly!” A powerful figure from the Qilin Clan spoke coldly, his voice ringing out.

“I agree!” A warrior from the Hun Tian Clan also spoke in agreement, his gaze fixed on the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“I concur… I’ve heard this human’s power has plummeted. He is now a sitting duck. So many of our kin have died at his hands—this grudge must be avenged!” With the Ancient Royal Clans leading the charge, the masses echoed in agreement, their eyes burning with fury as they roared.

“Move!” Several clan leaders nodded, then soared forward with their countless Ancient Ten Thousand Clans, charging into the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory.

“Damn it!” The Star Moon Divine Clan had just stabilized, and Fu Xingyang was discussing their future when his expression darkened abruptly.

In an instant, Fu Xingyang appeared above the Star Moon Divine Clan’s domain, his face pale as he beheld the sky filled with Ancient Ten Thousand Clans—especially the leading clan leaders. His eyes narrowed sharply.

“What business do you have in my Star Moon Divine Clan?” Fu Xingyang’s tone returned to calmness, his piercing gaze scanning the clan leaders.

“Divine Emperor, we know the truth—Luo Tian is among your people. Humans and the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans are sworn enemies. Please, Divine Emperor, slay this human!” The clan leaders, sensing Fu Xingyang’s Epoch Peak cultivation, glimmered with excitement before addressing him.

“Leave…!” Seeing these clan leaders address him like subordinates, Fu Xingyang’s expression turned icy, a supreme aura radiating from him.

“Even your prodigies would not dare speak to me thus. What makes you think you can demand this of me? Do you think the Star Moon Divine Clan is some minor clan to be bullied?” Fu Xingyang’s gaze swept over the leading clan leaders.

“You are the Star Moon Divine Clan’s Divine Emperor, that is true. But humans are our common enemy. Divine Emperor, openly sheltering a human is unwise.” The clan leaders wore an air of confidence. With the major clan prodigies and potential Grand Kings now in the Thunder Sea Marshes, their current forces were weakened. These Epoch Peak and late-stage cultivators managed clan affairs.

“We Star Moon Divine Clan act openly—no humans have ever entered!” Fu Xingyang sneered, denying it outright.

“Hmph…” Fu Xingyang’s reply left the crowd stunned. They hadn’t expected the Star Moon Divine Emperor to respond so brazenly and shamelessly.

“Divine Emperor, you’re being unreasonable. We are all here—everyone knows Luo Tian is among you. You cannot deny it. For the sake of unity, I urge you to hand him over; otherwise, we will not let this slide!” The clan leaders’ expressions turned threatening.

Chapter 1648: Search ()

“Are you threatening me?” Fu Xingyang’s eyes flashed with danger as he locked onto the Hun Tian Clan warrior who spoke, yet his lips curled in a smile.

“Dare? You are the illustrious Star Moon Divine Emperor. I am but a insignificant figure in your eyes. However, I am part of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans. Humans and the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans are sworn enemies—this is a universal rule. I believe the Star Moon Divine Clan, as a royal clan, would not shelter a human!”

“Otherwise, how could we not shatter the hearts of countless Ancient Ten Thousand Clans?” The Hun Tian Clan warrior met Fu Xingyang’s gaze without flinching.

“Yes, Divine Emperor, slay this human!”

“Kill this human…” As the Hun Tian Clan warrior’s words faded, other clan leaders spoke in unison, and the masses roared.

“Hun Tian Kuo, you’ve led the Hun Tian Clan for two days—have you become its master?” Fu Xingyang’s face turned icy, and he vanished in a flash to stand before the speaking warrior. His white palm radiated brilliance as it struck Hun Tian Kuo’s face.

“Pf!” The next moment, Hun Tian Kuo was sent flying backward, his skull cracking with a resounding sound. His eyes widened in disbelief as he spat blood, unable to fathom that even with the Star Moon Divine Clan’s dire situation, Fu Xingyang still dared to act so boldly.

“Rumors…” The crowd erupted in murmurs, their faces etched with fear as they gazed at Fu Xingyang.

“I said the Star Moon Divine Clan has no human—do any of you have objections?” Fu Xingyang stood firm, his aura overwhelming. The Star Moon Divine Clan’s people bore cold expressions.

“Those with doubts may stay; those without may leave the Star Moon Divine Clan!” Fu Xingyang addressed the leaders behind the clan leaders.

“Of course, I’ll pretend not to hear your doubts. When time permits, I shall visit your clans.” Fu Xingyang’s gaze carried authority as his aura radiated a killing intent.

“Divine Emperor, we merely came to see if the Star Moon Divine Clan has any issues—perhaps we may assist!” As Fu Xingyang’s words fell, some among the crowd wore smiles and addressed him.

The Star Moon Divine Clan was an Ancient Royal Clan, its depth immense. The Hun Tian Kuo’s audacity had not gone unchecked—Fu Xingyang had struck without hesitation. Imagine the fear of these minor clans, who dared not provoke the Star Moon Divine Clan. Though they were numerous, the Star Moon Divine Clan still had Grand Kings and elders like Fu Xingyue and Fu Tianba who had entered the Thunder Sea Marshes.

If those three returned, a single visit to these minor clans would leave them speechless.

With a rush, nearly half the crowd distanced themselves from Hun Tian Kuo and others, their faces filled with smiles as they gazed at Fu Xingyang. The remaining few were loyal to the major clans or strong clans waiting to see how events unfolded before deciding.

“Fu Xingyang, hand over Luo Tian quickly—else we’ll show no mercy!” Hun Tian Kuo’s face darkened as he wiped blood from his lips, his gaze fierce toward Fu Xingyang.

Most of the Hun Tian Clan’s warriors had entered the Thunder Sea Marshes, and Hun Tian Kuo’s ability to control his clan suggested high status. Fu Xingyang’s public slap had enraged him beyond measure.

“I stand here—show me how you’ll be ‘unmerciful’!” Fu Xingyang crossed his arms, scanning the major clan warriors.

“Divine Emperor, let me search the Star Moon Divine Clan—then we’ll know!” Before Hun Tian Kuo could speak, a Qilin Clan warrior sneered at Fu Xingyang.

“I said you may search—but dare you?” Fu Xingyang scoffed at the Qilin Clan warrior.

Fu Xingyang recognized all these major clan warriors, though they held high positions in their clans, they were still far beneath him.

“Why not?” A middle-aged man from the Yu Clan stepped forward, his body radiating golden light. Though Fu Xingyang was strong, his power had dropped to Epoch Peak. If these warriors united, they would not fear Fu Xingyang—only the Star Moon Divine Clan’s might restrained them.

At present, some Ancient Royal Clans were weak—since their prodigies and royal children had been slain by Luo Tian, rebuilding new prodigies would take time. Royal children were even more impossible to replace. Thus, these clans’ hatred for Luo Tian was boundless.

The Star Moon Divine Clan was an exception; though their royal child Fu Tu had betrayed them, they still had Fu Xingyang, a self-made Grand King. Fu Xingyue’s talent was undeniable, surpassing even Fu Xingyang—entering the Thunder Sea Marshes would surely make him a Grand King. Thus, the Star Moon Divine Clan’s strength would rise another level.

These clans had lost their prodigies or royal children, and with no outstanding prodigies to speak of, they sought this opportunity to suppress the Star Moon Divine Clan and dim their brilliance.

“If you don’t find him, then leave!” Fu Xingyang’s face darkened as he addressed them.

“If we don’t find him, we’ll leave!” They replied confidently.

“Hmph—search! I’ll say this: if you don’t find him, stay here!” Fu Xingyang’s gaze held disdain before stepping aside.

With Fu Xingyang leading, the Star Moon Divine Clan people cleared a path for them, their eyes cold as if anyone stepping on it would be attacked.

“Go!” Hun Tian Kuo and others exchanged glances, then gritted their teeth. Having reached this point, they could not back down.

As Hun Tian Kuo’s group spoke, the clan warriors accompanying them wore grim expressions but dared not delay. They soared into the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory.

Yet, as they passed through the path cleared by the Star Moon Divine Clan people, they broke out in cold sweat, feeling immense pressure upon them.

Finally, with Fu Xingyang’s command, the Star Moon Divine Clan people did not attack. They watched silently as figures rushed into their domain.

“Looking for me?” Luo Tian smiled, seated in the void. After three days, his power had not recovered, but his complexion was much improved.

“Truly a dream!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. Not only was he in the void, but even if he stood within the Star Moon Divine Clan, no one would find him.

“No Grand King-level strength—this is a good sign!” Luo Tian mused, calculating. With no Grand King in the Mortal Domain now, if his power recovered, he could walk through the entire domain unchallenged.

“Hope you don’t leave—when I recover, I’ll visit each of your clans and eliminate them!” Luo Tian closed his eyes again, sitting before Fu Xingxuan to recover swiftly.

Time passed slowly as the Ancient Royal Clans searched the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory for three days, yet found nothing.

“Do you plan to search forever? I’ll give you another three days—should you find nothing, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Fu Xingyang’s gaze held cold amusement. After these days of recovery, he had regained much strength, hinting at a return to Grand King status.

“Fine—three days!” They felt Fu Xingyang’s shifting aura and grew anxious.

Time passed swiftly, three days later, those who had searched for Luo Tian returned to Hun Tian Kuo’s group, empty-handed.

“Very well—now it’s time to keep my promise!”

“Star Guard!”

“Xingyang Guard!”

“Stellar Guard!” Fu Xingyang coldly commanded, his aura rising.

“In!” A low roar echoed behind Fu Xingyang as the Star Moon Divine Clan people, eyes burning with anger, gazed at Hun Tian Kuo’s group.

No one would enjoy having their home searched by others, and now Hun Tian Kuo’s group had ignited the Star Moon Divine Clan’s fury. The Star Moon Divine Clan had never suffered such humiliation before.

“Will you stay yourselves, or shall we help?” Fu Xingyang addressed them, his hand holding a replica of the Star Moon Divine Spear.

Seeing Fu Xingyang’s true anger, the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans’ faces turned tense. If a fight broke out, the Star Moon Divine Clan might suffer heavy losses—but they would not fare better.

“Wait!” Just as Fu Xingyang prepared to issue orders, Hun Tian Kuo’s voice rang out again. His gaze met Fu Xingyang’s; his heart was also tight. He hadn’t expected Fu Xingyang to dare fight them.

“Want to finish your show and leave?” Fu Xingyang’s lips curled in disdain, not sheathing his weapon.

“We still have one place left to search—Star Moon Palace. If we don’t search it, it means we haven’t fully searched the Star Moon Divine Clan. We can leave now, showing respect to the Star Moon Divine Clan!” Hun Tian Kuo spoke, his gaze on Fu Xingyang.

“Leave…” Fu Xingyang’s face darkened further, his killing intent surging.

“Kill!” The Star Moon Divine Clan people roared, their aura of fury overwhelming as they pressed toward Hun Tian Kuo’s group.

Chapter 1649: Walking Unchallenged ()

The Star Moon Palace was sacred to the Star Moon Divine Clan, housing ancestral relics from generations past. Even many within the Star Moon Divine Clan had never entered it. Now, Hun Tian Kuo’s group sought to enter—how could the Star Moon Divine Clan allow it?

“We know the Star Moon Palace is sacred to your clan, so we have no intention of offending it. However, without searching the Star Moon Palace, it means we haven’t fully searched the Star Moon Divine Clan. We can leave now, showing respect to your clan!” A warrior from the Jin Wu Clan spoke, his gaze carrying a hint of amusement. The Jin Wu Clan’s relationship with the Star Moon Divine Clan was not close, but it was passable.

“Don’t worry—my clan has a method that might find this Luo Tian!” Before Fu Xingyang could speak, a warrior from the Blood Clan spoke softly.

“Really?” Hearing this, everyone’s eyes brightened as they turned to the middle-aged man.

Tu Changsheng, uncle of Tu Feiyang and a revered figure in the Blood Clan, was well-known.

“I can try—though I’m not certain!” Tu Changsheng spoke softly, his hands moving swiftly. At the same time, other Blood Clan warriors accompanying him also moved their hands.

“Hum…” A humming sound echoed as blood-colored Epoch energy flew from the Blood Clan warriors’ hands, forming a blood-red script dragon that coiled above them.

“Go!” Tu Changsheng barked, and the blood-red script dragon soared upward. As it circled above, its eyes glowed red.

At the moment the blood-red script dragon took flight, Luo Tian, seated in the void, sensed it. He opened his eyes, confusion flickering across them.

“What method is this—how could it find me?” His eyes widened in shock as the blood-red script dragon flew directly toward his void.

“Found him!” Tu Changsheng’s face lit up, then he pointed toward the direction of Luo Tian’s void.

“Ah—hiding in the void, masking his aura with vast spiritual sense. Naturally, it’s hard to find!” Hearing Tu Changsheng’s words, the crowd’s faces brightened as they deduced Luo Tian’s method.

“Now that he’s found, there’s no need to hide anymore!” Luo Tian spoke softly, then gazed at Fu Xingxuan. He didn’t want to disturb her and extended his hand, tearing open the void. With a step, he exited the void.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian stepped out, the blood-red script dragon roared toward him. A smile flickered across Luo Tian’s face.

“Boom…” Without hesitation, Luo Tian punched forward, striking the blood-red script dragon.

The explosion echoed, and the blood-red script dragon shattered on Luo Tian’s fist, dispersing into blood-colored Epoch energy around him.

“Found him!” Seeing Luo Tian appear, the crowd’s faces lit up in joy. They hadn’t expected to find Luo Tian so easily.

“Divine Emperor, what do you have to say now?” Hun Tian Kuo’s face bore mockery as he gazed at Fu Xingyang, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

“What to say?” Fu Xingyang’s eyes flashed coldness before he spoke sharply, his gaze locking onto Hun Tian Kuo.

“Who is this man? Why have I never seen him before? Epoch Peak warriors are rare in the Star Moon Divine Clan, aren’t they?” A Qilin Clan warrior’s eyes also held mockery as he stared at Luo Tian.

“Blind? Which eye did you see him as a human’s Luo Tian? His aura clearly belongs to the Star Moon Divine Clan—how could he be a human!”

“The Star Moon Divine Clan has millions of people. Who among them reached Epoch Peak? Do you think you’re worth anything?” Fu Xingyang’s face bore a smile as Luo Tian approached him. He secretly sighed in relief, fearing Luo Tian might impulsively reveal his true identity, causing the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans to unite against him. For now, if he denied it outright, there would be no problem.

“Respect the Divine Emperor!” Luo Tian cooperated with Fu Xingyang, bowing respectfully as if truly a Star Moon Divine Clan member. After all, he was his future brother-in-law—what harm was there in a bow?

Seeing Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang’s brazenness, Hun Tian Kuo’s group gritted their teeth. They had no evidence to prove the unknown Star Moon Divine Clan member was truly Luo Tian.

Yet, it was the Star Moon Divine Clan who had given them the news. And this man held a high position within the Star Moon Divine Clan. They had seen Luo Tian single-handedly fight three Grand King-level warriors—how could they be wrong?

“Enough—decide among yourselves who stays!” Fu Xingyang’s face turned icy. Now he had the upper hand, and he would not let this insult go unanswered.

“This…” Seeing Fu Xingyang turn the tables, Hun Tian Kuo’s group turned pale, as if having swallowed a fly.

“Everyone here witnessed them falsely accusing us of colluding with humans. I let them search the Star Moon Divine Clan. Now, pointing at any of my people and calling him a human—this is outright provocation against the Star Moon Divine Clan. If this is let slide, how can we command respect?” Fu Xingyang spoke again, standing on the moral high ground. His voice carried authority.

“Stay!” Fu Xingyang vanished in a flash, reappearing before Hun Tian Kuo. The replica of the Star Moon Divine Spear became a streak of light, smashing toward Hun Tian Kuo.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!” Fu Xingyang had acted, and the Star Moon Divine Clan people, who had been holding their anger for a long time, roared and charged toward the clan warriors and supporting masses.

Hun Tian Kuo’s group was still stunned, not expecting Fu Xingyang and the Star Moon Divine Clan people to act so swiftly. As they reacted, Fu Xingyang had already struck.

“Boom…” The replica of the Star Moon Divine Spear, carrying immense force, smashed onto Hun Tian Kuo’s head.

At the same time, the Star Moon Divine Clan people clashed with Hun Tian Kuo’s group and their supporting masses.

As Fu Xingyang rushed out, Luo Tian vanished from the scene in an instant, appearing before the Qilin Clan warrior. His golden fist surged forward with overwhelming power toward the Qilin Clan warrior.

“Fast!” The Qilin Clan warrior’s eyes widened in disbelief, stunned for a moment before being struck by Luo Tian’s fist.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed from the Qilin Clan warrior, his body flying backward like a broken kite, vanishing into the crowd.

Though Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang’s power had dropped, they had previously dominated Epoch Peak warriors. Even with their decline, one Epoch Peak warrior could not match them.

“Kill!” Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang, like two war gods, charged through the crowd, seeking out the major clan leaders.

“Terrifying! How terrifying this Epoch Peak Star Moon Divine Clan member is! I feel he’s even more formidable than the Divine Emperor!” The crowd who had not participated in the search and had already left wore shock as they watched each of the clan warriors being crushed like insects. Wherever Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang had passed, a bloodbath spread within a hundred yards.

A massive battlefield erupted again in the Star Moon Divine Clan, though they had just recovered from Fu Tu’s chaos and did not wish for another battle. But when enemies invaded their home, how could they endure? They took out their anger toward Fu Tu and Sun Hanyang on these clan warriors.

The newly built Star Moon Divine Clan territory crumbled again, for this battlefield included Epoch-level warriors—each was immensely powerful.

“Found him!” Luo Tian continued to kill the clan warriors, for they were all future enemies and had come to trouble him. He held no mercy, utterly crushing them. Soon he found the Qilin Clan warrior he had previously knocked away.

“Damn it! How did you find me again!” The Qilin Clan warrior tore through a Star Moon Divine Clan member before spotting Luo Tian’s overwhelming aura. His face darkened, and he dodged into the crowd to escape. He knew he could not match this Star Moon Divine Clan member, who was even more ruthless than Fu Xingyang. His previous punch had already wounded him severely.

“You won’t escape this time!” Luo Tian smiled, appearing before the Qilin Clan warrior. His Dadao Fuming Fist surged forward again, golden fists radiating immense power toward the opponent.

“I’ll fight you!” The Qilin Clan warrior regretted his underestimation of Luo Tian. If their clan elders returned and coordinated with other clans, killing this Luo Tian would not be difficult. But they had acted in haste, believing that with so many of them surrounding one person, there was a high chance of success. Who could have predicted that even at Epoch Peak level, Luo Tian remained invincible? Even he felt he couldn’t last long against Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The two fists collided, and the violent shockwave took the lives of those around them, leaving a clear space.

Chapter 1650: Close the Gate and Let the Dogs Out ()

“Boom…” Luo Tian stood on the void, gazing at the Qilin Clan warrior spewing blood. He vanished again in an instant toward the middle-aged man.

“Qilin Arm!” The Qilin Clan warrior, seeing Luo Tian charging like a primordial beast, felt his heart waver. He roared, and his body radiated waves of energy as intricate script patterns appeared on his arms.

“No use!” Luo Tian saw the scripts on the man’s arms and sneered. He could sense that the man’s arms had strengthened with the appearance of the blue scripts, but Luo Tian still felt no fear. Epoch Peak warriors would be crushed under him.

“Boom…” The next moment, golden and blue fists collided. The man flew backward again but this time was stronger—no longer spitting blood.

“Good, you’ve improved a bit. But I’ll kill you with three punches!” Luo Tian sneered, then unleashed his full power. His body curved as he activated the Grand King Battle Technique, vanishing in an instant to appear before the Qilin Clan man. Two great techniques empowered him as he struck toward the man.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian moved, the Qilin Clan warrior felt a massive threat. He no longer maintained human form but transformed into a blue Qilin, its massive body radiating heavy energy as it roared.

Its thick hoof lifted high, ready to crush Luo Tian like an ant. But massive size did not mean strength. Though Luo Tian was smaller than the blue Qilin, his power easily dominated this giant.

“Boom…” The explosion echoed as Luo Tian struck the Qilin’s hoof.

“Roar…” A piercing roar filled the battlefield, stopping it in its tracks—too ear-piercing.

“Boom…” Then, blood rained down as the blue Qilin’s body collapsed the sky, flying backward. Its half-body was shattered by Luo Tian’s punch.

“This is the first punch!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness as he stood still, ignoring the fear of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans. His foot pushed off the ground like a reaper’s scythe, harvesting lives of clan warriors as he rushed toward the Qilin Clan man again.

“Hum…” Just as Luo Tian moved, a blood-red figure silently appeared behind him. Blood fangs emerged, aiming for his back.

But Luo Tian acted as if unaware, allowing the blood fangs to strike him. A smile flickered on his face before he struck the Qilin Clan’s broken body again.

“Boom…” This time was even more thorough—blood mist rose, and the blue Qilin turned into a blood mist, floating in everyone’s sight.

“Break…” At the same time, the blood fangs pierced Luo Tian’s back.

But a gasp echoed behind Luo Tian as Tu Changsheng, the Blood Clan warrior, wore disbelief. His hand held the blood fangs.

“This is the second punch!” Luo Tian smiled, then turned sharply, his eyes shooting two sharp beams of light toward the Blood Clan warrior.

“How is this possible!” The Blood Clan warrior spoke in disbelief. He had thought his attack would at least wound Luo Tian, but instead, it pierced only Luo Tian’s clothes, leaving a blood mark.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian smiled and kicked the Blood Clan warrior’s chest.

“Crack…” A crackling sound echoed as Tu Changsheng’s face showed disbelief. His chest caved in, and he spat blood and organs.

“Keep Fu Xingyang occupied— I’ll help them!” On the other side, a middle-aged warrior from the Jin Wu Clan and Hun Tian Kuo, along with a蛮 Clan warrior, were attacking Fu Xingyang. However, they fared better than the Qilin and Blood Clan warriors.

Though Fu Xingyang was powerful, his flesh and Epoch energy were not as formidable as Luo Tian’s. Three warriors’ attacks could still make Fu Xingyang cautious—otherwise, he might be injured.

“You’re really confident—two of you can contain me?” Fu Xingyang sneered at their conversation, swinging the replica of the Star Moon Divine Spear to enclose them. They could not break free.

“Hum…” A feather warrior from the Yu Clan rushed toward Luo Tian, his feathers glowing and forming sharp blades to cut him.

Luo Tian smiled as the dazzling feathers attacked his body. Sparks flew, and these sharp feathers—capable of killing Epoch Late-stage warriors or wounding Epoch Peak ones—only left marks on Luo Tian before disintegrating into gusts of wind.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s body curved again, vanishing before the Yu Clan warrior and Tu Changsheng. He reappeared before the Qilin Clan man who had just formed his body, his script-covered fist striking.

Blood again stained the sky as the Qilin Clan man who had just formed his body turned into a blood mist, with scripts flying from Luo Tian’s fist to consume the mist and soul.

“This! This is the third punch!” Luo Tian spoke softly, then turned to face the Yu Clan warrior and Tu Changsheng.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian smiled, then clenched his fists and rushed toward the Yu Clan warrior.

“Damn it!” The Yu Clan warrior and Tu Changsheng’s faces darkened—unbelievable, Luo Tian was so strong.

Killing a single Epoch Peak warrior with three punches—this was impossible in their minds. They thought only the top human cultivators could achieve this.

“Can’t match!” Seeing Luo Tian rushing toward them, their hearts skipped a beat before they dodged in two directions.

“Want to run?” Luo Tian’s face bore disdain as he saw them flee in two directions. He then addressed Fu Xingyang: “Big brother, close the gate!”

“Got it!” Fu Xingyang laughed. Though he faced three opponents, he hadn’t finished them as quickly as Luo Tian had, but he still restrained Hun Tian Kuo and the others. They could only endure being beaten.

“Hum…” The next moment, Fu Xingyang held a golden banner in his hand and waved it toward the sky. Golden light rose, and stars glowed across the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory.

As the stars rose, the world turned dark, as if plunged into night. Stars filled the sky, and a golden moon hung there.

“Star Gathering Moon Formation!” The crowd’s faces changed instantly, for this formation made them feel the outer cosmos vanish.

“They’re trapped in the Star Moon Divine Clan!” Everyone felt a bad premonition.

At present, the major Ancient Royal Clans and their accompanying masses were at a disadvantage. Their high-level forces had lost one Epoch Peak leader in a short time, and the remaining ones were restrained or fleeing. It was only a matter of time before they fell.

Their low-level forces could withstand the Star Moon Divine Clan’s people, but once high-level forces were free, they would be swept aside.

“The gate is closed—now it’s time to let the dogs out!” Luo Tian smiled, forming a complex script with his hands.

“Roar…” A deep roar echoed through the world, emitting a powerful aura from the script.

“This is a Grand King’s aura!” The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans’ faces turned pale—unbelievable, Luo Tian had a Grand King ally. A single Grand King could annihilate them all.

The golden script seemed to open a door to another world, emitting immense pressure that made everyone stop. Not because they wanted to, but due to the Grand King’s aura, they could not move. Only Fu Xingyang and Hun Tian Kuo’s battle continued.

“Woof…” Three dog barks echoed through the world, and a black figure rushed out of the golden script like lightning. It appeared before Luo Tian, its eyes showing affection.

“What is that? A dog? Why three heads?” People trembled, staring at the three-headed dog resembling a mongrel, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Good—get to work!” Luo Tian patted the three-headed dog’s head, smiling. He pointed toward the Yu Clan warrior who had fled: “Bring him back—fight back, and bite him to death!”

“Woof… Woof…” The three-headed dog barked twice before its body expanded, transforming into its massive form. Its fierce face made people shiver, not believing their small bodies could withstand a single bite.

Chapter 1651: Captured ()

The massive body appeared before Luo Tian, lowering its head to let him stand on it.

“I’ll rest a bit—leave the rest to you!” Luo Tian soared upward, standing on the three-headed dog’s head. His eyes held a smile.

The three-headed dog’s strength was naturally formidable. Luo Tian had not released it during his battle with Fu Tu and three others because of confidence, the need for a fight to become an Epoch Master, and thirdly, he had forgotten about it.
