The pool water was clear, tinged with silver, and radiated a chill. What drew Luo Tian's attention were three figures seated on a massive stone by the poolside.

"Jie Du, Zhi Zhang..." Luo Tian recognized two of them. After all, this master-disciple pair was too distinctive—both had bald heads that gleamed brightly. Between Jie Du and Zhi Zhang sat an old man, clad in gray robes, his white hair flowing freely. His face was serene, and he held a fishing rod with the line dangling into the pool.

Chapter 2600: Familiarity

"Isn't this Luo Tian? What brings you here?" Luo Tian spotted the three, and naturally, they saw him too.

"Respected elder, what brings you here?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at Zhi Zhang while vigilantly observing the old man seated there fishing.

From start to finish, the old man remained with his eyes closed, as if immersed in some realm.

"I said it already—come to visit my old friend! That inn was his doing!" Zhi Zhang addressed Luo Tian.

"Deeply concealed!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly as he regarded the old man. To befriend Zhi Zhang, this elder was clearly no ordinary person.

"You two really can't stop talking; you'll scare off my fish, and you won't be able to bear the consequences!" Zhi Zhang's words had barely finished when a cold snort echoed in their ears. The old man suddenly lifted his rod, and a flash of silver light appeared.

Silver scales gleamed brilliantly under the sunlight. A one-foot-long silver dragon fish emerged into view, but this one was several times shorter than the ones they had eaten before—those were three feet long.

"Silver Dragon Fish!" Chen Zhanbiao shouted, his eyes alight with joy, almost drooling.

"Haha... old comrade, I won't be polite!" Zhi Zhang laughed heartily and extended his hand to snatch the flying silver dragon fish.

Zhi Zhang's movements were lightning-fast, his hands glowing with divine light. In an instant, he was before the fish.

"Zhi Zhang, again trying to steal my things? Not worthy enough to eat!" But the old man had apparently anticipated Zhi Zhang's move. With a flick of his wrist, the fish vanished into thin air, leaving Zhi Zhang grasping at nothing.

The old man hadn't even moved; everything was natural. With a gentle tug, he seemed like an ordinary person, but Zhi Zhang was a Xian Wang powerhouse. To catch a fish, he couldn't even manage it.

"This elder... his face is so familiar. Where have I seen him before?" Luo Tian gazed at the old man, his thoughts growing heavier. He hadn't expected such a powerhouse to be hiding in this small Panlong City.

"The world is vast, and there are too many masters!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, pondering where he had met this elder.

*Plop...*

As Luo Tian mused, a splash erupted. The silver dragon fish the old man had caught was cast back into the pool.

"Even a fly's leg is meat. Even small, it can be eaten!" Chen Zhanbiao grumbled, watching the old man. Zhi Zhang's face also bore reluctant disappointment.

"Master Wang is cultivating these silver dragon fish?" Jie Du's face lit up, his gaze turning to the old man.

"Continue speaking!" The old man glanced at Jie Du without emotion, then pointed his finger. A wisp of gray energy landed on the fishing hook.

"Soul Essence!" Jie Du gasped, stunned. He hadn't expected the old man to use Soul Essence as bait.

"It's about to begin!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. He hadn't anticipated the old man would use such a method for fishing.

"Evidently, there's more than one Soul Essence," Luo Tian mused inwardly, observing the souls attached to the fishing hook.

"Respected elder, this isn't ethical. Though it's a soul, it's still a life!" Jie Du began to persuade the old man. But the old man seemed deaf, placing the soul bait on the hook and casting it into the pool without a ripple.

"Respected elder, you can't do this. You're killing!" Jie Du spoke up, reaching for the fishing line. He couldn't allow the old man to kill.

"Your cultivation is still far behind your master!" The old man spoke softly. The fishing line vanished, leaving Jie Du grasping at nothing.

"Little one, what does the Buddha teach?"

"The equality of all beings, birth and death, how to transcend..." The old man spoke softly, his gaze fixed on the fishing rod.

"How many people has this soul killed in life?"

"Ten thousand!"

"If I release him, he'll seek a body. Isn't that harming another? And do you know if he'll kill again after awakening, harming more people?" The old man spoke again.

"So the Buddha teaches to cultivate him, guiding him toward benevolence and helping others!" Jie Du furrowed his brows, sensing the old man's words made sense but clashed with his path.

"Evil people are still people. I believe everyone is born good; if they truly cultivate, they can become benevolent!" Jie Du spoke again.

"Big brother, what are they talking about? I don't get it!" Chen Zhanbiao asked, his gaze turning to the pool, pondering whether to dive in and catch fish.

"Neither do I!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. He seemed to grasp why Zhi Zhang had brought Jie Du here.

In summary, it was four words: too deep a fixation. Jie Du's personality had become twisted; if this continued, he might lose himself entirely—step by step, one path of Buddhism, the other of demonry. He might fall into demonic ways because of this single misstep.

"Goodness? Let me ask you, does your master eat meat and drink wine? Is he good?" The old man furrowed his brows, speaking again.

"Is this big guy, this kid, not stained with blood? Are they good?"

"Goodness is relative. The world has light and darkness; to their loved ones, they are good, but to their enemies, they're despicable!" The old man spoke.

"Zhi Zhang, take him away. His fixation is too deep; I can't save him. I think you should give him your Buddhist name!" The old man shook his head gently.

"Don't leave, Jie Du! Stay here for a month!" Zhi Zhang wouldn't agree.

Jie Du furrowed his brows, his eyes filled with confusion. He had thoughts but didn't know what to say.

At this moment, Chen Zhanbiao moved. He leapt into the air, rushing toward the pool—too much temptation.

"Old man, I'll catch some fish and leave!" Chen Zhanbiao grinned, tossing a net made of divine energy into the water.

"This kid can't learn martial arts, but he's self-taught!" Luo Tian was exasperated but didn't stop Chen Zhanbiao.

"No!" The old man furrowed his brows, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao with surprise. He extended a hand, sending out an invisible wave.

Crack...

The fishing net shattered, and Chen Zhanbiao's body seemed to be pushed back by an invisible hand.

"This fish is yours?" Chen Zhanbiao roared, his voice like thunder. The old man sighed and watched the fish about to bite the hook disappear.

"Do you think I'll beat you up?" Chen Zhanbiao roared, gazing at the old man. But Luo Tian stopped him.

"Where did these people come from?" Luo Tian muttered inwardly, bowing to the old man: "Respected elder, my intrusion is regrettable. Please forgive me!"

"Your three carry an aura I recognize!" The old man gazed at Luo Tian and his companions, a faint smile on his face.

Chapter 2601: Human Talent

"Recognize?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows at the old man's words, but sensed no hostility from him.

"Yes. You should come from the Three Thousand Small Worlds!" The old man scrutinized Luo Tian carefully.

"Epoch Master! Indeed, we are from the same homeland!" The old man's eyes carried a nostalgic look, sighing deeply.

"Respected elder is from the Nine Regions?" Luo Tian widened his eyes, gazing at the old man, recalling which human Epoch Master he was.

"My name is Wang Duantian. Perhaps your era has forgotten my name!" The old man spoke softly, and Luo Tian was struck like lightning.

"My god..." Meng Xue also bore an expression of disbelief, gazing at the old man.

"Of course I recognized him! It's Master Wang!" Luo Tian hadn't expected this person to be Wang Duantian.

"The first Epoch Master of humanity, the ultimate strength who resisted the peak of all races, who founded a golden age for humanity and led it out of servitude!" Luo Tian's mind conjured the achievements of Epoch Master Duantian.

"What strength is he now?" Luo Tian, though weakened, still had his eyes. He couldn't fathom Wang Duantian's strength.

Who would have thought a human talent would live in such an obscure place?

"Recognize?" Zhi Zhang stared, stunned. He watched Luo Tian and his companions respectfully. Even Chen Zhanbiao of the Ancient King Clan was respectful toward Wang Duantian.

"Respected elder, can you give us some fish? After all, we are your juniors!" Chen Zhanbiao still hadn't given up on the silver dragon fish.

"Did I meet juniors from the Nine Regions?" Wang Duantian smiled, lifting his rod. A three-foot-long silver dragon fish appeared before him.

"Take it! Each of you one, no more!" Wang Duantian lifted his rod again. Two more fish appeared before him.

Wang Duantian extended a hand, and three fish flew toward Luo Tian's group. Luo Tian smiled.

"Take it, Zhanbiao!" Luo Tian bowed to Wang Duantian and spoke again: "Respected elder, our Tianyuan Sect is established here. If you don't mind, you can stay at our Tianyuan Sect. Luo Tian wouldn't miss this great deity. He couldn't fathom Wang Duantian's cultivation, and he believed Wang Duantian was definitely a major power capable of resisting the peak Xian Wang. Such a person, if in Tianyuan Sect, would surely let it stand firm in the Xian realm. Tianyuan Sect now lacks such people.

The strength of the Heavenly Court was formidable, but figures like Jietian Master were reluctant to emerge. With Wang Duantian around, it would be much more secure.

But Luo Tian knew the restrictions of the Middle Three Realms suppressed peak Xian Wangs. Wang Duantian definitely hadn't reached the peak of Xian Wang, but Luo Tian believed his methods surpassed late-stage Xian Wang by much.

"Is it the Tianyuan Continent in the Four Saints Realm?" Wang Duantian's face bore nostalgia, then he shook his head gently.

"Never mind. I'm old; I just want to be at peace!" Wang Duantian declined Luo Tian's proposal.

"Zhi Zhang, you can leave!" Wang Duantian addressed Zhi Zhang, issuing a dismissal.

"Old Wang, you're too impolite. At least let me have a drink with you!" Zhi Zhang pouted, unwilling to leave.

"If you quit drinking, your strength would rise again!" Wang Duantian shook his head gently.

"You can stay. Let old man fish, but everyone else must leave!" Wang Duantian's eyes showed impatience. He waved his hand.

An invisible wave instantly affected Chen Zhanbiao, Zhi Zhang, and Meng Xue. The void silently opened, and their bodies were thrust into it.

"Old Wang, teach my disciple well!" Zhi Zhang's voice echoed through the heavens. Panlong Pool fell into silence.

"Little monk, your master left you here, but don't interfere with my matters. Some things must be understood by yourself; when you grasp it, you'll understand!" Wang Duantian addressed Jie Du. As for Luo Tian, he didn't pay attention.

"Apologies, respected elder!" Luo Tian's face bore reverence. He knew that being near such a powerhouse would surely teach him something.

"By the way, respected elder, Wang Wang has also arrived in the Xian realm. You don't want to see him?" Luo Tian spoke, informing Wang Wang had also ascended to the Xian realm.

"Destiny will meet when it's time. Perhaps it's not yet!" Wang Duantian's emotions slightly wavered.

Luo Tian kept speaking, recounting what he knew of the Nine Regions to Wang Duantian.

Wang Duantian listened calmly, as if hearing a story. He didn't ask anything.

Jie Du was engrossed; the Three Thousand Small Worlds were another world to him.

"Master Jie Du, can you cultivate them? The entire Xian realm you couldn't cultivate, let alone the Three Thousand Small Worlds!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Jie Du.

"Little one, the Xian realm won't be peaceful. This battle between Hell and the Xian realm is just the beginning! Every day, people die—not just one or two!" Wang Duantian interrupted Luo Tian, making him tense.

"Just the beginning!" Luo Tian seized on Wang Duantian's words. His mind was puzzled. If this battle between Hell and the Xian realm was just the beginning, what else would come?

"Fishing!" Wang Duantian said no more. He seemed immersed in his own world, focusing on fishing.

Luo Tian didn't speak further. Jie Du sat cross-legged on the stone, meditating. He knew he couldn't stop Wang Duantian.

The three sat quietly here. The entire forest was unusually peaceful. Luo Tian, for once, felt calm. Fishing wasn't his hobby, but he was enjoying this peace.

Until nightfall, Wang Duantian hadn't caught a single fish. Luo Tian also hadn't, since he had no bait.

Night fell. Wang Duantian, with an empty fish basket, stood up and walked down Panlong Mountain. He didn't worry about anyone returning to catch fish.

The three walked for an hour, returning to the inn. The staff were curious about Wang Duantian.

"Isn't that the person who used a single divine crystal to catch silver dragon fish yesterday? And that monk, the disciple of Zhi Zhang? How come they're following our boss?"

"I said it—our boss is a powerhouse. Look, no one who caused trouble in our inn has ever returned twice. Now even the monks from Xumishan are following him. And that young man, looking weak, could produce a single divine crystal—definitely not an ordinary person!" People whispered among themselves.

Chapter 2602: Hell's Invasion

War is cruel. Hell was determined to win this battle, so it had prepared thoroughly. Eight ghost gates formed a surrounding from the eight directions of the Xian realm, attacking it.

The Middle Three Realms were in chaos. Corpses littered the land; people died daily on the battlefield. Even though the sects of the Middle Three Realms fought desperately, they couldn't stop Hell's forces.

Ten thousand miles... millions of miles... tens of millions of miles...

The vast Middle Three Realms gradually became Hell's territory. Every sect suffered heavy losses, and the war didn't know when it would end.

Some sects couldn't withstand the pressure and received orders to move into the Upper Three Realms. As for the Lower Three Realms, they were isolated from the Upper and Middle Realms once the Middle had been taken. The Lower would inevitably be occupied.

Time passed slowly. Two years had gone by, and Hell's forces finally united. The eight armies pressed the Middle Three Realms' powers into one place.

This war started with attacking the Ghost Gate, lasting nearly ten years. Even with resistance from the Middle Three Realms, they couldn't stop Hell's invasion.

One Sky Pass, the base of Bai Sect, the first sect in the Middle Three Realms. All sects had retreated here.

One Sky Pass had a natural barrier—a massive void rift. Behind it was the vast幻天海 (Huan Tian Sea), easy to defend and hard to attack, hence its name.

The area around One Sky Pass spanned millions of miles. All people in the Middle Three Realms were there, faces filled with despair.

"Duanshen Sect destroyed... Suixing Mountain destroyed... All cities in the Middle Three Realms lost!"

"Ten years of fighting, and this is the result!" People sighed to the sky. This battle had caused too many deaths.

Blood spread across every part of the Middle Three Realms. Countless Xian realm cultivators died. Any force that resisted was destroyed. Only those who submitted to Hell were spared.

"Too strong! Though Hell also suffered, the gap was too big!" People sighed, gazing at the towering peaks of One Sky Pass. The remaining sect leaders gathered there.

Outside the massive void rift, countless black figures stood, their faces weary and excited. Their auras soared into the sky, radiating thick ghost qi that turned the entire sky black, with eerie ghost qi.

Hell's forces had thirteen Xian Wangs at their peak. They stood there, gazing at the massive void rift. The rift isolated the inner air.

"From today on, the balance between Hell and the Xian realm will change. Hell is no longer a prison but the ruler of this world. We'll conquer the Upper Three Realms, and all under heaven will be Hell's domain!" A Xian Wang at the peak said coldly.

"Listen, you inside! You've been surrounded. If you're wise, come out and surrender. Otherwise, when we fill this void rift, we'll exterminate you all!" A Xian Wang at the peak shouted loudly. His voice echoed through the void rift above One Sky Pass.

Despair and tension spread through One Sky Pass. Everyone knew they couldn't match the Hell forces outside.

"Everyone, release ghost qi to fill this void rift. When it's filled, that's when we attack!" An old man spoke, sending waves of ghost qi into the rift.

Hell knew that forcing their way through the void rift would cost them heavily. So they decided to fill it.

Vast ghost qi entered the void rift, causing no ripples. But Hell's numbers were overwhelming; countless waves of ghost qi poured into the rift.

"Done..." People in One Sky Pass could clearly feel the void rift changing gradually.

"This void rift will take them a year or two to fill!" People estimated the filling speed, but they were helpless. The situation was that the entire Middle Three Realms had been occupied by Hell, and One Sky Pass, though vast, was still much smaller than the entire Middle Three Realms.

However, there were still places in One Sky Pass not occupied. For example, the Death Desert and other dangerous regions. Another place was Tianyuan Sect.

After two years of rest, Tianyuan Sect had finally settled. But with Hell's strong attack on the Middle Three Realms, Tianyuan Sect also became tense.

Hell would definitely not let Tianyuan Sect exist. Once they finished with One Sky Pass, it would be their turn.

At this moment, in Tianyuan Sect's council hall, Jiang Síxī and others sat there, faces serious.

"Reports say Hell's forces are filling the void rift outside One Sky Pass. Right now, people inside have two possibilities: either the peak Xian Wangs of the Upper Three Realms open a passage to the Upper Three Realms, or the void rift is filled, and Hell's forces exterminate them!"

"The speed of filling the void rift will take one or two years," Diao Dede said, closing the jade slip he received.

"Additionally, Star River Mansion hasn't suffered any damage. Buxian Xian Wang had previously moved Star River Mansion into the Upper Three Realms," Diao Dede knew what they were asking and spoke again.

"Better to prepare early. Luo Tian hasn't returned yet; this is the critical moment!" They thought of Luo Tian, biting their teeth.

Luo Tian's injuries had long healed. But this man was like possessed, staying with Wang Duantian and not returning. They had been busy these past days.

"Don't mind him. Let's discuss how to deal with it, find a thorough plan. Also, is that fat monk still here?" Jiang Síxī's face showed rare sorrow.

"He is. He spends his days hanging out with Zhanbiao and those two dogs. The four of them go out every day, eating well and drinking, more carefree than Luo Tian!" Hearing Jiang Síxī's words, people were even less willing.

"It seems we need to negotiate with Hell. Or wait for Luo Tian; he's the most suitable!" Jiang Síxī spoke.

At this moment, Luo Tian was on Panlong Mountain. He sat on a large stone with a fishing rod in hand, his body radiating calmness. His back showed the scars of his injuries healing, and the words "Gui Gu" (Ghost Valley) reappeared.

Luo Tian sat beside Wang Duantian. On the other side of Wang Duantian was Jie Du, but his aura was completely different from before. He had also picked up a fishing rod, joining Luo Tian and Wang Duantian in fishing. Luo Tian's rod was black, its tip radiating cold light—what seemed like a fishing rod was actually the "Rip Heaven Spear."

Chapter 2603: Understanding the Spear

The calm water, the large stone—Luo Tian and his companions sat there. They seemed like old monks in meditation.

They had been sitting here for two hours. For two years, Luo Tian and his companions came every morning and returned to the inn at dusk.

At first, it was Luo Tian and Wang Duantian fishing. Jie Du watched from the side. Gradually, it became three people.

Luo Tian hadn't caught a fish at first. He could only catch small fish after a month. Later, he finally managed to catch three-foot-long big fish.

After catching, Luo Tian switched back to the Rip Heaven Spear. He returned to his initial state—hands empty every day.

"Brother Luo, I said your spear has too much hostility; it scares them away!" Jie Du smiled, raising his hand. A silver dragon fish flew out and landed in his hands.

Jie Du gently removed the fish, then put it back into the water. His gaze turned to Luo Tian. Since a year ago, Jie Du had started fishing, releasing every fish he caught.

With Jie Du's fishing, his aura changed significantly. Luo Tian couldn't pinpoint where the change was, but he knew Jie Du had advanced from Xian Wang Initial to Xian Wang Middle.

"Brother Jie Du, you're wasting it!" Luo Tian shook his head gently, gazing at his Rip Heaven Spear.

The silver dragon fish in this pool had intelligence. The Rip Heaven Spear had accompanied Luo Tian for years, killing countless people. Thus, it carried hostility, scaring the silver dragon fish away.

This was a choice for Luo Tian. For a year, he had focused on fishing with the Rip Heaven Spear. Previously, his battles had always used a sword, disrupting his spear path.

If he continued like this, the Rip Heaven Spear would eventually be replaced by a sword. That wasn't what Luo Tian wanted. After all, the Rip Heaven Spear had been with him for too long; he didn't want to abandon it, even if it meant giving up the sword path.

"A year's time is about enough!" Luo Tian mused inwardly. For a year, he had devoted himself to the spear, not thinking about the sword path. Fishing was an excellent method for cultivating one's mind and body, allowing Luo Tian to focus entirely and forget the sword path.

As he spoke, the Rip Heaven Spear in his hand seemed to change. It radiated waves of intent—this intent was excited, as if a child abandoned by parents had finally found them.

"The hostility has faded!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, murmuring to himself.

*Swish...*

Water waves stirred. The rod in Luo Tian's hand slowly sank, making his eyes shine with light. He didn't use his cultivation to pull the fish up but stood up, holding the Rip Heaven Spear and walking with the fish's movement.

As Luo Tian walked, the Rip Heaven Spear trembled. It seemed to dance with the spear—sometimes fast, sometimes slow.

Wang Duantian opened his eyes. Jie Du gazed at Luo Tian, watching his aura change.

The Rip Heaven Spear in Luo Tian's hands seemed to have strong vitality—sometimes fierce, sometimes flexible.

"This kid, it wasn't a waste of two years!" Wang Duantian smiled, watching Luo Tian walking on water.

"Thank you, respected elder!" Jie Du's face bore reverence. In two years, he had learned much. His gains were even greater than Luo Tian's. He had recognized his own attachments and abandoned them. Though he still saved people, he no longer tried to save everyone—save yourself first.

Jie Du had saved himself in these two years. If he continued his old ways, he might have gone astray.

"Both of you have good insight. The road ahead is long, but it's about helping both of you recognize yourselves and what you truly desire," Wang Duantian spoke softly, then stopped talking.

In these two years, Wang Duantian had spoken little. But each time he spoke, it was to enlighten them when they were confused or provoke deep thoughts.

"Respected elder is the first person I've ever seen in my life. None of the Buddhas in our sect can match him!" Jie Du's eyes showed admiration. In two years, Wang Duantian had truly made him respect.

"Your master isn't simple either!" Wang Duantian smiled lightly. Zhi Zhang was from the same era as him in the Xian realm, so they were lifelong friends. Wang Duantian knew Zhi Zhang's strength well. Though he looked unreliable, he was definitely not as simple as he seemed.

*Buzz...*

As they spoke, the void trembled. A dark light pierced through the sky. Luo Tian finally lifted the Rip Heaven Spear, pulling out the silver dragon fish.

"I can't understand it!" Jie Du's eyes showed shock. That spear move seemed simple, but Jie Du could feel its power—he couldn't withstand it.

"Rip Heaven Spear!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, collecting the fish and placing it on the stone.

"Alright, let's go back early today!" Wang Duantian stood up, collecting his rod. He rarely left so early.

Jie Du and Luo Tian naturally obeyed. The three collected their fish baskets and walked toward Panlong City.

As soon as they returned to Panlong City, their faces changed slightly. They gazed at the figures cloaked in ghost qi filling the city streets.

Thousands of people filled the streets, their bodies radiating a killing intent. The aura stretched all the way to the central city hall.

"Hell's ghost cultivators? How did they get here?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, recognizing these people as coming from Hell.

Luo Tian had spent two years in Panlong City but knew about outside events. He knew the entire Middle Three Realms had been occupied by Hell's forces.

"Let's check it out!" Wang Duantian stepped forward toward the city center. The city hall was next to his inn, so he naturally wanted to see it.

"Stand still! Huangtian Sect passes through. Strangers, step back!" As the three moved, several figures blocked their path.

"His back has a character. Very unique!" Seeing Luo Tian, the several ghost cultivators showed mockery.

"Gui Gu..."

"Wait... I feel like it's familiar!" But then the several people showed recollection.

"I remember! It's Luotian, the Saint of Lunzhuang Sect!" The several people's faces instantly showed fear, gazing at the calm Luo Tian.

"It is me!" Luo Tian nodded. He took a step forward, swiping aside the several people with one hand. His aura spread out.

"Xian Wang..." People on both sides of the street felt Luo Tian's powerful pressure, their faces changing.

"Back then, he looked weak and fragile!"

"Wait, those Hell ghost cultivators said he was Luotian. Is it the Luotian from Tianyuan Sect? That Gui Gu character is the best proof. He's Luotian!" People instantly became chaotic, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 2604: Hell's Envoy

Luo Tian, one of the true power holders in Tianyuan Sect, could be said to be the most powerful. Without Luo Tian, Tianyuan Sect would have failed several crises. In recent times, Tianyuan Sect controlled ten thousand miles, and Panlong City was included. The people of Panlong City naturally knew Luo Tian's name.

At this moment, Luo Tian's appearance instantly drew people's attention. The Huangtian Sect people also dared not be reckless, for this person was someone they couldn't afford to offend.

Luo Tian and his companions stepped toward the city hall. As they were about to enter, they met someone.

A tall figure, radiating a powerful aura. Upon appearance, his gaze immediately found Luo Tian and his companions.

"Luotian!" Seeing Luo Tian, the man instinctively shivered. But then his eyes showed resentment.

"An old acquaintance!" Luo Tian recognized the person, also surprised. Then a smile appeared on his face.

Yi Jianren, Saint of Huangtian Sect. He had been killed a hundred times by Luo Tian during the Ten Sects' Grand Competition, haunted by fear of Luo Tian.

At that time, Luo Tian hadn't killed Yi Jianren but returned his soul to the Huangtian Sect Master.

"Your eyes are better?" Luo Tian gazed at Yi Jianren, smiling. Yi Jianren instinctively feared him.

"Smell of blood!" Jie Du sniffed, gazing at the city hall. His eyes narrowed slightly.

"A despicable person, killing on Tianyuan Sect's territory!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly. He gazed at Yi Jianren.

"Killed him, what of it? Tianyuan Sect's territory is now Hell's. You don't know?" Yi Jianren laughed coldly, his eyes mocking.

Yi Jianren's strength wasn't weak. After ten sect masters jointly enhanced the Saint and Saintess, Yi Jianren had reached Xian Wang Middle.

Another reason was that Yi Jianren was the Saint of Huangtian Sect. He believed Luo Tian wouldn't dare to touch him, for Luo Tian had joined Tianyuan Sect. Essentially, he was no longer connected to Lunzhuang Sect. So a Tianyuan Sect wouldn't dare to touch the ascendant Hell.

Yi Jianren had come here to persuade Tianyuan Sect to surrender. This Panlong City was just a stop. He first came here to greet the city lord, asking him to submit to Hell.

But after the city lord said one sentence—Panlong City now belongs to Tianyuan Sect—Yi Jianren directly killed them. The city hall's two hundred people were all wiped out.

"You're really ruthless, killing such a weak Panlong City!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with murder, gazing at Yi Jianren.

"Killed him. What of it? You dare to touch me?" Yi Jianren shouted, his voice filled with arrogance and joy. He knew Luo Tian wouldn't dare to touch him. If he did, Huangtian Sect and Tianyuan Sect would be at war.

"Sorry, I don't eat shit!" Luo Tian coldly replied. He was on the verge of explosion, weighing the consequences of killing Yi Jianren.

...

Yi Jianren was speechless at Luo Tian's response, unsure how to reply.

"I have another matter. That is for you to surrender to Hell. If not, after finishing with One Sky Pass, Tianyuan Sect will be gone!" Yi Jianren shifted the topic, shouting loudly. His gaze turned to Luo Tian.

Yi Jianren's words fell silent across Panlong City. The city hall had been destroyed, making the people of Panlong City fearful.

"Are you so sure I won't kill you?" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his aura spreading out. A powerful killing intent burst forth, landing on Yi Jianren's face.

"You dare! You don't care about Tianyuan Sect!" Yi Jianren still had a shadow of fear toward Luo Tian, even though his strength had increased.

"You're about to destroy my Tianyuan Sect. Do I care about killing a Saint of the Ten Ghost Gates?" Luo Tian's face bore a cold smile. His black spear appeared in his hand, its body radiating eagerness.

*Crack...*

As Luo Tian just took out the Rip Heaven Spear, a crisp clap echoed in everyone's ears. Yi Jianren's body suddenly flew backward.

*Boom...*

Yi Jianren fell to the ground, his eyes filled with confusion. But it was instantly replaced by fear.

"Who... who hit me!" Yi Jianren shouted, his heart terrified. He didn't know who had struck him.

"Who?" Others were also confused. A Xian Wang Middle, silently knocked out by someone—how strong was this person?

"I did!" Wang Duantian's gaze remained calm. He stepped toward Yi Jianren, making Yi Jianren shocked.

Yi Jianren hadn't considered Wang Duantian. He thought he was just Luo Tian's servant.

"Great power! This old man is definitely a great power!" Yi Jianren's heart trembled, gazing at Wang Duantian calmly approaching him. His heart was filled with terror.

"Death..." Wang Duantian spoke softly, gazing at Yi Jianren. Like a command, a powerful pressure instantly descended on Yi Jianren.

"Respected elder, mercy!" Yi Jianren shouted. But he couldn't speak out before feeling difficulty breathing.

*Boom...*

Blood mist rose, and Yi Jianren's body turned into a cloud of blood. It scattered on the ground, horrifying to see. The surrounding Hell ghost cultivators trembled.

Terrifying—this Xian Wang Middle was killed with a single word. Everyone gazed at Wang Duantian, even Luo Tian and Jie Du's eyes showed disbelief. They had lived with Wang Duantian for two years but had never seen him fight before, and this was so clean and effortless.
