In a modest second-floor room, a figure lay motionless, rigid as a lifeless corpse.

“Cold…”

Luotian’s sole sensation was coldness—unlike the usual aftermath of his Heavenly Demon Body Dissolution technique. This time, he felt as though every part of him was no longer his own. He could not fathom the cause, yet the only thing keeping him alive was the awareness of his own heartbeat. Gentle warmth radiated from his chest, spreading throughout his body.

“What could it be? Did my injuries run too deep?” Luotian pondered, his mind in turmoil. He could not move, so he let fate take its course.

In the inn’s courtyard, several figures stood in hushed conversation.

“What kind of person could wield a ghost crystal?” one servant asked, his gaze fixed on Luotian’s room.

“A strange man, I suppose,” another replied. “He’s been holed up here for days without ever stepping out.”

Since Luotian had rented the inn, these servants had been idle. The innkeeper had ordered them to stay away, and they were grateful for the respite.

“I heard the innkeeper has already informed the city lord. A ghost crystal—such a rare item—it’s certain this man is no ordinary person.” Their greatest topic of speculation was Luotian’s identity.

“Why don’t you, Chen Er’er, pretend to do something and check the situation? If the city lord arrives, you’ll have earned great merit!” They nudged one another, eager to satisfy their curiosity but too afraid to act.

“What are you all doing? Why aren’t you working?” A disgruntled voice cut through their gossip. Three figures emerged.

A youth led the group, clad in a brocade robe, flanked by several slack-jawed youths—clearly his henchmen.

“Master Li!” The innkeepers shivered, immediately bowing in reverence.

“Which room is he in?” The youth’s face bore arrogance as he addressed the innkeepers. They pointed to Luotian’s second-floor room, and the youth gazed at it with narrowed eyes.

“What kind of person could possess a ghost crystal?” His brows furrowed. In Hell, strength dictated survival; though the Central Three Realms had fallen under Hell’s control, its nature remained unchanged.

The youth strode toward the second floor, his steps echoing with arrogance. His name was Li Tianchi, a prodigy who had reached the True Immortal Realm at a young age. He was the son of the Heaven-Dog City Lord.

“Hear that Li Tianchi is about to enter the Sealed Ghost King’s City, becoming its guardian? Once he does, the surrounding cities will surely become vassals of Heaven-Dog City!”

“Indeed! Li Tianchi is the guardian of Sealed Ghost King’s City. If he gains the favor of the Ghost King, not only will those surrounding cities submit, but even regions spanning tens of thousands of miles will fall under Heaven-Dog City’s dominion!” The innkeepers spoke with reverence, watching Li Tianchi stride toward the second floor. His henchmen followed, their faces brimming with pride as if they themselves were the subject of admiration.

As Li Tianchi reached Luotian’s door, his gaze flickered with curiosity. Though arrogant and domineering, he was not foolish—he knew Hell’s currents were treacherous. Perhaps this man was a powerful figure. Yet, his curiosity burned; he had come to test the stranger. If this man was weak, Li Tianchi would seize his ghost crystal without hesitation.

“Friend inside, I am Li Tianchi of Heaven-Dog City. Might you grant me a moment to speak?” Li Tianchi smiled as he stood outside the door.

No response came from within, and Li Tianchi’s brow furrowed slightly. Yet he sensed danger—this man was no ordinary soul.

“Friend inside, would you grant me a favor?” Li Tianchi persisted, but still no reply.

Meanwhile, Luotian lay motionless, hearing Li Tianchi’s words but unable to answer.

“Damn luck,” Luotian thought bitterly. He knew the men outside had ill intentions.

Luotian’s heart ached; he was at his weakest. If Li Tianchi entered and killed him, he would have no strength to fight back.

“What’s happening?” Luotian fretted, feeling the warmth in his chest—the only sign he was still alive.

“Friend inside, won’t you show some courtesy?” Li Tianchi persisted, but dared not force his way in.

Time passed. After a quarter-hour, Li Tianchi grew impatient and pushed open Luotian’s door.

A blinding surge of golden light erupted from Luotian’s chest, illuminating the room and bursting outward.

“Ah!” Li Tianchi cried out as his eyes burned, feeling as though needles pierced them. A powerful force hurled him backward, sending him crashing through the second-floor railing and plummeting to the ground.

Crash! The railing shattered, and Li Tianchi’s henchmen tumbled down with him, landing atop his body. Blood spewed from Li Tianchi’s mouth.

“Too bright!” The innkeepers gaped, momentarily blinded before witnessing Li Tianchi’s fall.

The servants rushed to assist Li Tianchi and his men, helping him up. A middle-aged man emerged—this inn’s manager. Seeing Li Tianchi spitting blood, his face turned pale.

“Master!” The manager cried, rushing to Li Tianchi’s side and lifting him. His face paled further upon realizing the severity of Li Tianchi’s injuries—his bones seemed shattered.

“Who resides here?” All hearts trembled; Li Tianchi was a formidable figure, yet he had been repelled without even seeing the opponent.

“Go…” The manager knew the gravity of the situation. If mishandled, his life would be forfeit. He led Li Tianchi out of the inn toward the city lord’s mansion.

“Whatever happened?” Luotian wondered, suspecting it was the World Heart’s self-preservation.

“Finally avoided!” Luotian sighed, still lying there but feeling faint sensations returning to his limbs. Yet he had no idea when full recovery would come.

After Li Tianchi’s severe injury, the Heaven-Dog City Lord dared not approach the inn. The building was sealed off, forbidding entry.

Time passed. Half a month later, Luotian had regained enough sensation to lift one hand.

“How long until I recover? I wonder what’s happening outside!” Luotian fretted, estimating he’d need at least half a year—or even a full year—to fully recover.

Yet, his lifted hand felt unusually strong. If his entire body recovered, he suspected his physical form could reach the peak of an Immortal King!

“Wait,” Luotian sighed. He hoped no misfortunes would arise during this time.

During the month Luotian lay in bed, chaos erupted in both the Immortal and Hell realms. Ten Palace Saints—both from Heaven and Hell—had been captured, save for Ye Qiu, who had escaped.

Even more shocking was Ye Qiu’s ignorance of the attacker, leaving everyone stunned.

“How could these Saints suffer such a fate? Once leaders of their realms, now kidnapped!”

“Especially Hell’s Saints—twice they’ve been taken. Even if released, they’ll carry lasting trauma. Who could endure such humiliation?” All murmured in disbelief.

But this was only the beginning. A month after Luotian’s bedridden state, a monumental event occurred in Hell: the太平殿 (Taiping Palace) of the Yama Ten Palaces was annihilated.

The Taiping Palace had existed since ancient times, but its losses during the previous assault on Tianyuan Sect were devastating. Its Immortal King-level leader had been slain, leaving the palace weakened.

Yet despite this, no one doubted its strength—its foundation remained unshaken. But now, it had been obliterated by the mysterious Luo Shengmen (Reaper Gate).

In that battle, eight million Taiping Palace disciples—ranging from Heavenly Dao to Immortal King levels—were wiped out, leaving no survivors. The surrounding area turned crimson; the Reaper Gate took days to clear the aftermath.

The most shocking part was how swiftly the Reaper Gate had destroyed the Taiping Palace—within seven days, leaving no time for other palaces to intervene.

“Reaper Gate! How dare they defy us!” The nine remaining palace lords raged, their voices echoing.

“Which palace dares challenge us? We’ll fight!” The bloodthirsty declaration rang from the Taiping Palace, unyielding and dismissive of the nine lords.

Yet the other palace lords remained silent. Their recent assault on Tianyuan Sect had left them weakened, and now the Reaper Gate had dared to provoke them. They deemed the Reaper Gate no weaker than Tianyuan Sect.

Thus, Hell gained a new power—the Reaper Gate—occupying the former Taiping Palace’s territory.

Meanwhile, another event shook Hell: Tianyuan Sect began invading the Central Three Realms, expanding its dominion ruthlessly. The palace lords were enraged; their hard-won Central Three Realms had become another’s spoils.

“Tianyuan Sect, don’t overstep! Do you think we’re powerless now that you’ve repelled us?” The lords roared. Yet Tianyuan Sect remained silent, continuing its expansion.

The Upper Three Realms took no part in this conflict, focusing instead on tracking down the force that had kidnapped their Saints.

Hell found itself in a precarious position, facing both the Reaper Gate and Tianyuan Sect. The world’s balance seemed to shift subtly.

“Do you think we’re mere decorations?”

“First, eliminate the Reaper Gate; then deal with Tianyuan Sect!” Faced with a coordinated challenge from both forces, the palace lords finally decided. Several lords personally wielded world treasures and marched toward the Reaper Gate.

Yet, to their shock, Huangtian Palace Lord betrayed the others, ambushing Lunzhuan and Pingdeng Palace Lords before defecting to the Reaper Gate.

That battle darkened the skies, shaking Hell itself. The Taiping Palace’s million-mile radius was reduced to ruins.

Eight lords returned to their palaces, announcing retreats that left everyone in awe.

After this battle, the Reaper Gate solidified its dominance, seizing four Hell realms and becoming the preeminent power.

An age of chaos! Everyone knew both Immortal and Hell realms had turned into turmoil, the world’s balance subtly shifting.

The Nine Immortal Mountains received news of the palace lords’ retreat, their members delighted.

“What is this Reaper Gate? How could it cripple Hell’s forces?”

“The Central Three Realms have been taken by Tianyuan Sect, with over half under their control. With Hell’s current strength, it won’t take more than a fortnight to seize the Central Three Realms!”

“This Hell has lost its chance. I’ve investigated—Tianyuan Sect lacks peak strength. We can seize the Central Three Realms now; it’s a divine opportunity!” Immortal Kings from the Upper Realms plotted how to counterattack.

…Luotian remained unaware of these events, lying alone in the inn for six months.

Six months later, Luotian had recovered two arms and one leg, able to move freely.

That day, Luotian still lay in bed as the inn stirred with new arrivals.

Chapter 2764: Gu Guanyu

“Master Li!” The innkeepers bowed respectfully as Li Tianchi reappeared after half a year.

Though Hell and the Immortal Realms had seen much turmoil, this remote northern city remained untouched. Its insignificance made it unnoticed by any faction.

“Hmph.” Li Tianchi’s face bore resentment as he gazed toward Luotian’s room. For half a year, it had been tormenting him.

He had spent six months recovering from his injuries, aided by healers summoned by his father.

Behind Li Tianchi stood two men with weak auras, their Heavenly Dao-level strength no match for his henchmen.

“Has he not emerged yet?” Li Tianchi asked without entering.

“True Immortal Realm Mid-Stage!” The innkeepers gaped, sensing Li Tianchi’s aura. In half a year, he had advanced to the Mid-Stage of True Immortal Realm.

“Correct! Master entered the Mid-Stage of True Immortal Realm a month ago!” His henchmen praised loudly.

Li Tianchi’s eyes gleamed with pride at their flattery—this was his purpose for coming.

Though he had nearly perished, he felt a new aura within himself. That aura had been refined, and to his surprise, it had propelled him into the Mid-Stage of True Immortal Realm.

The past half-year had been a nightmare for him, yet it had also seen his meteoric rise. Each day, he felt his strength surge rapidly.

“Fate!” Li Tianchi realized immediately it was his fortune. Though painful, the rapid strength gain was unparalleled.

“Take the risk!” Li Tianchi resolved inwardly. Though he might be injured, if he could reach the Late-Stage of True Immortal Realm, it would be invaluable. At that level, he could enter certain factions—perhaps even become a senior within the Sealed Ghost King’s City.

Yet this time, he had learned wisdom. Recently, he had captured two prisoners—two youths with intriguing resilience. He had tortured them relentlessly, but they refused to submit.

“You two—give me another chance! If you submit, you’ll live!” Li Tianchi barked at the two weak youths. He had run out of patience; if they didn’t submit today, he would end their lives.

“Spit! Who do you think you are? Do you know who my uncle is? My uncle is Luotian!” One youth spat, his voice laced with contempt.

“Do you know who he is? He’s Luotian’s disciple! A disciple! Do you dare touch him?” The youth added, his voice filled with anger.

“Luotian?” Li Tianchi shivered instinctively. Who in the world didn’t know Luotian? Even this remote Heaven-Dog City had heard of him.

To Li Tianchi, and even to Heaven-Dog City itself, Luotian was a deity—far beyond their world.

“You two dare? If you’re his disciples, I’m his father!” Li Tianchi sneered, unaware that the man he spoke of—Luotian—was lying upstairs, listening to their exchange.

“Yichen, Guanyu!” Luotian’s heart surged with excitement. He hadn’t descended, but he knew the situation below.

These two captives weren’t just anyone—they were his disciples, Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu.

“Alive… still alive!” Luotian’s excitement quickened his recovery.

“You’d better release us now! My uncle might spare your life! Otherwise, this small Heaven-Dog City will be wiped out by my uncle!”

“Release us now and let us go to Tianyuan Sect. We’ll give you treasures beyond your imagination!” Gu Guanyu shouted, recalling the darkest month of his life.

They had endured torment, but their resolve held firm—otherwise they would have broken long ago.

If counted by actual age, they had lived longer in the Nine Realms than Luotian.

Yet it was their nature—Gu Guanyu remained as carefree as ever. During their captivity, they had learned about Hell and the Immortal Realms, hearing of Luotian’s existence. Gu Guanyu wanted to use the tiger’s might, but he didn’t know if the Luotian spoken of in Hell and the Immortal Realms was truly his uncle. Still, he decided to name him anyway.

“Since you won’t submit, I’ll have no choice but to end your lives!” Li Tianchi sneered, dismissing Gu Guanyu’s lies. He grabbed the two youths and ascended the stairs toward Luotian’s room.

This time, his henchmen dared not follow—after the previous ordeal, they had been thoroughly exhausted.

“Go!” Li Tianchi felt an oppressive aura within the room, a sense of unease. He tossed Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen into Luotian’s room.

A moment later, the two youths crashed against the door, breaking it open and tumbling inside.

“Huh? Why’s it dark?” Li Tianchi glared, surprised the “treasure” had vanished so quickly.

Crash! Two dull sounds echoed as Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen fell to the ground, dazed.

“Nothing’s wrong?” Li Tianchi’s face lit up, seeing the two youths unharmed. He also saw Luotian lying in bed.

“Dead! He’s dead!” Upon seeing Luotian, Li Tianchi immediately sensed no life.

“Ah! It’s fate—my fortune!” Li Tianchi laughed, no longer holding back. He strode into the inn toward Luotian, who radiated a cold aura.

Li Tianchi drew closer, feeling the faintness of Luotian’s aura.

“You were surely a strong person before—lowest, a half-step Immortal King. But you died at the hands of this small fry!” Li Tianchi unsheathed a long blade, its cold light glinting. He reached Luotian’s side and raised the sword to strike.

“Uncle!”

“Master!” As Li Tianchi’s blade descended, the two youths cried out in shock, staring at Luotian.

A surge of golden light erupted before Li Tianchi’s eyes. His body shivered, and the corpse’s hand—still gripping his falling blade—moved.

Chapter 2765: Li Chuncheng

Cold eyes sent shivers through Li Tianchi, as if lightning struck him. His blade could not move.

“Die!” Before Li Tianchi reacted, a cold voice echoed in his ears.

Crack! Li Tianchi’s blade began to shatter, spreading outward. In his terror, his arm and body started to crumble like the blade, breaking within Luotian’s room.

The room was eerily silent as Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen watched Luotian.

“Master!”

“Aunt’s husband!” The two youths had never expected to meet Luotian here. They rushed to his side.

“Don’t move!” Luotian spoke, unsure of his own condition and fearing harm to the two youths.

“Why are you here?” Luotian asked, having recovered enough to speak after six months.

“We were in the Divine Beast and Demon Ancient Cave, then something happened—Luo Li led us into the void. But the void was too dangerous; we almost died. Then a spatial storm scattered us. I and Yichen fell here, captured by this Li Tianchi!” Gu Guanyu, having inherited Zheng Xin’s and Gu Lei’s teachings, recounted the events without omission.

“Aunt’s husband! This Hell is too terrifying! You don’t know what we’ve endured!” Gu Guanyu lamented to Luotian.

Dong Yichen said nothing, but his injuries spoke volumes. This stirred anger in Luotian’s eyes.

“Come here!” Luotian ordered the two youths, who approached. He waved his hand, and a storage ring fell at their feet.

“What’s inside is enough to destroy the entire Heaven-Dog City!”

“Wait until I recover, then let you two take revenge!” Luotian told them. If they wanted their lives, he wouldn’t be easy to provoke.

At the same time, Luotian felt grateful for his six months of recovery. If he had arrived earlier, he would have been killed by Li Tianchi’s blade.

“Got it!” Gu Guanyu’s eyes brightened; he knew Luotian had never been stingy. The storage ring surely held treasures.

“First, cultivate! Enhancing strength is the most important!” Dong Yichen said, his eyes alight.

They had reached the Heavenly Dao Realm before entering the Immortal Realms, but this rekindled Dong Yichen’s fighting spirit.

“Don’t let your master down!” Dong Yichen clenched his fists, regaining motivation.

“Okay,” Gu Guanyu clutched Luotian’s storage ring, eager to unleash chaos immediately. Yet he wasn’t a child; he knew that acting rashly might bring trouble to Luotian.

Luotian was injured, though he hadn’t said so. Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen weren’t blind; if they caused trouble, inviting threats to Luotian would be disastrous.

“Hmph,” Luotian nodded inwardly. The two youths had matured, becoming more composed. He sighed, thinking how the children had grown.

Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen’s sudden appearance also gave Luotian hope. Luo Li and Luo Xiting were surely alive—after all, the two youths had unique constitutions.

Li Tianchi’s henchmen waited for a long time but saw no sign of Li Tianchi. They grew frantic.

They had come here reluctantly, not wanting to, but Li Tianchi insisted they follow.

“Is the master in trouble?”

“Why hasn’t he come down yet?” The henchmen wondered, too afraid to check. Finally, they bit the bullet and left the inn, leaving the servants stunned.

Seeing the henchmen leave, the servants hesitated before their faces darkened. They gathered their belongings and left the inn toward Heaven-Dog City’s outskirts. The inn fell silent.

Time passed. An hour later, the entire Heaven-Dog City was in chaos as figures surrounded the inn.

A middle-aged man strode into the inn, his face angry. This was Heaven-Dog City’s Lord, Li Chuncheng.

“Come out, whoever you are! I am Li Chuncheng!” Li Chuncheng shouted to the second floor.

“What’s happening?” The crowd around the inn erupted in confusion.

“If you won’t come out, I’ll enter myself!” Li Chuncheng sneered, though he was nervous. After all, Li Tianchi had reached the Mid-Stage of True Immortal Realm, matching his strength. Yet he had no confidence.

But with his son’s life uncertain, Li Chuncheng had to check. Moreover, once Li Tianchi entered the Sealed Ghost King’s City, he would surely rise with him.

As Li Chuncheng stepped forward, two youths emerged from the room, their faces smirking as they gazed at Li Chuncheng.

“Is it you?” Li Chuncheng’s eyes narrowed; he had seen these two before.

“Where is Tianchi?” Li Chuncheng ignored the two Heavenly Dao-level youths, dismissing them as insignificant. He could kill them in an instant.

“He’s inside!” Gu Guanyu replied, his gaze playful as he clutched Luotian’s storage ring.

Though Li Chuncheng was merely a city lord, his mind was sharp. He sensed the two youths were up to something but dismissed them as Heavenly Dao-level, relaxing slightly.

“I’ll see what tricks you have!” Li Chuncheng sneered inwardly and stepped toward the second floor.

A surge of energy erupted as Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen moved, each brandishing a talisman. They hurled them at Li Chuncheng before retreating into Luotian’s room, where a wave of energy enveloped the inn.

Li Chuncheng scoffed, raising his sword to pierce the talismans.

Crash! As Li Chuncheng moved, a thunderous explosion echoed through the inn, sending a wave of power down the stairs and engulfing him.

In an instant, no one remained in the inn—everyone was shattered into nothingness, as if they had never existed. Yet this explosion shook the people outside, causing them to spit blood and gape in terror.

Chapter 2766: Self-Boiling

“What happened?” Everyone gasped, staring at the inn.

The crowd scattered in confusion, sensing something terrible had occurred. Li Chuncheng’s guards dared not leave, waiting a full day before someone braved to enter. That person never returned.

Spooky! The Heaven-Dog Inn became a forbidden place in the city; anyone who entered never returned.

Lord Li Chuncheng was likely dead, a fact that spread among Heaven-Dog City’s factions.

Li Chuncheng had long been despised in the city, oppressing its people and other factions. Now that he was gone, their plans to eliminate him were thwarted.

Time passed. A month later, the united factions began to fracture, each vying for control of Heaven-Dog City.

The city became unstable, yet no faction dared enter the inn.

In the inn, Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen sat cross-legged beside Luotian’s bed, their auras flickering.

On the first floor, several figures bowed respectfully—these were the people who had entered the inn over the past month.

Boom! A deep sound echoed as Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen opened their eyes, their faces alight with joy.

“True Immortal Realm Mid-Stage—good!” Luotian spoke, still lying in bed but now able to move his head. His face showed satisfaction.

For a month, Luotian had taught the two youths, as he had nothing else to do.

Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu had deep foundations, and with Luotian’s guidance as an Immortal King Late-Stage, their cultivation speed soared.

“Mid-Stage of True Immortal Realm—remarkable!” The people below praised loudly.

“If I reach the Late-Stage of True Immortal Realm, I’ll assign you a task!” Luotian said. He had recovered somewhat and could now protect the two youths in Heaven-Dog City.

“Late-Stage of True Immortal Realm!” Dong Yichen’s eyes gleamed with determination, his gaze respectful toward Luotian as before.

“A task?” Gu Guanyu was more interested in the task; he wasn’t a quiet person. This period had driven him mad.

Cultivation—endless cultivation. The room fell silent again as Luotian observed the two youths’ progress and secretly monitored his own body. He felt his physique was being transformed by the Nine Realms’ World Heart, albeit slowly. Yet when complete, he sensed a qualitative leap.

Time passed. Half a year later, Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen finally reached the Late-Stage of True Immortal Realm.

Luotian had also recovered most of his strength, though he still needed to lie in bed. His arms and legs could now move freely.

“Now I should be able to handle an Immortal King Early-Stage!” Luotian calculated his strength.

Three months later, two youths stood in the former city lord’s mansion, their bodies bloodied. They gazed at the figures within the grand hall.

“Will you submit now?” Dong Yichen’s face was cold as he watched the trembling people.

These were Heaven-Dog City’s factions. Three months ago, Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu had taken over the city.

“Submit!” The hall’s people bowed respectfully. Though their strength might surpass the two youths, their methods were no less ruthless.

“Enough. Tell us everything about recent events in the Immortal Realms and Hell—details, please!” Dong Yichen spoke softly. He didn’t value Heaven-Dog City; he knew Luotian was training them, as their rapid cultivation had left their foundations unstable.

“Understood!” The people replied immediately, recounting the recent Immortal Realms’ events.

“Hell remains the same—two of Yama’s Ten Palaces have been seized by the Reaper Gate, clashing with the other eight.”

“Immortal Realms are more exciting. Upper Three Realms have descended, vying for the Central Three Realms. Hell resists, sending troops to fight.” A middle-aged man spoke.

“The new force in the Central Three Realms, Tianyuan Sect, is now caught between two fronts. Yet it’s strong enough to withstand pressure!” Others marveled.

“Tianyuan Sect?” Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu whispered, their eyes filled with hope.

“Leave!” Dong Yichen waved his hand, and he and Gu Guanyu left the city lord’s mansion to return to the inn.

They recounted their findings to Luotian, who grew anxious.

“No more waiting!” Luotian resolved. After this time, he had pondered how to accelerate his progress.

He extended a hand, and the Mountain-Sea Cauldron appeared at his bedside. He told the two youths: “Lift me in!”

“Huh?” Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen were stunned, unsure what Luotian meant. This cauldron was a treasure for refining elixirs—why would he enter it?

“Don’t just stand there! Hurry!” Luotian, seeing their bewilderment, urged them to act.

“Uncle! What are you doing? Don’t do anything reckless…!”

“You’re my uncle, and if something happens to you, how will I explain it to your father and aunt?” Gu Guanyu began muttering as they lifted Luotian.

“You insolent brat…” Luotian was exasperated, cursing the boy for being so annoying—clearly a mix of Zheng Xin’s, Gu Lei’s, and others’ influences.

The two youths struggled to lift the cauldron’s lid and tossed Luotian inside, then secured it.

Crash! As they closed the lid, a sound of flowing water echoed from within.

“Uncle must be urinating… he’s been holding it for so long, right Yichen?” Gu Guanyu spoke again.
