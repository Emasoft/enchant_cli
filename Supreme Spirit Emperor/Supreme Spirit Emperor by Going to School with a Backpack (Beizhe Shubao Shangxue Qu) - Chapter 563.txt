“During this time, I have been here and have not seen the souls of those who ascended with us. Therefore, those who ascended with us initially should not have perished; they are either in the Immortal Realm or in Hell!” Fu Xingxuan spoke again.

“I do not know where Sxi and Qiu Chan’s sister are, but their talents are commendable; there should be no major issues!” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, herself having been here for some time and feeling a touch of boredom.

“Rushing...” As the two spoke, waves echoed from the Yellow River, towering waves rising swiftly. A colossal creature burst forth from the Yellow River, appearing before Lo Tian’s eyes.

A massive tortoise, its body like a mountain. It resembled the Xuanwu of the Four Sacred Star Domains but was not as large, yet its aura sent shivers through Lo Tian.

“Xiao Ming, why have you emerged?” Fu Xingxuan’s face lit with a smile as she addressed the tortoise.

“Roar…” The Ming Tortoise let out a low growl, its massive eyes brimming with hostility toward Lo Tian.

“Hello!” Lo Tian shivered, chuckling nervously and greeting the tortoise.

“Crack…” The Ming Tortoise opened its mouth, drawing forth souls that were devoured instantly by its maw.

“These souls are of those who committed great evils in their past lives. The Ming Tortoise feeds on these souls to strengthen itself,” Fu Xingxuan explained to Lo Tian, patting the massive head of the tortoise as it swam before them.

“Go play; this is my husband, not a villain!” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, her voice laced with amusement.

“Rushing...” The Ming Tortoise glanced at Lo Tian before turning its body and submerging into the Yellow River.

“Wife, you’ve truly become powerful…” Lo Tian’s face bore admiration, his gaze filled with awe.

“Then behave yourself. Although Su Dan is tempting, you must not touch her!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes gleamed with amusement as she gazed at Lo Tian, a dangerous glint in her gaze.

“How could that be? Don’t you know how upright your husband is? It was Su Dan who seduced me; there’s nothing between us!” Lo Tian exclaimed indignantly, his words honeyed.

“Hmph. I know your tricks well,” Fu Xingxuan scoffed. If he were truly as he claimed, he might still be alone in the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Wife, we haven’t been intimate for a long time… Look…” Lo Tian gazed at Fu Xingxuan’s pouting lips and could no longer resist, pressing his lips against hers.

“Go wash; your body is filthy!” Fu Xingxuan laughed, kicking Lo Tian off the gray bridge.

“Plunge…” Water splashed as Lo Tian failed to react, gulping down two mouthfuls of Yellow River water. His face darkened instantly.

“The Yellow River has the power to purify souls. Go bathe and rid yourself of that stench!” Fu Xingxuan called out to Lo Tian.

“Got it!” Lo Tian laughed, then seized Fu Xingxuan and pulled her down.

“Come give me a back rub!” Lo Tian grinned, approaching Fu Xingxuan as she was drenched by the river. He grabbed her, his hands becoming mischievous.

“Mmm…” Fu Xingxuan let out a soft sound. A white lotus flower rose, expanding again to envelop the two, sealing their presence.

An hour later, the lotus bloomed. Lo Tian and Fu Xingxuan emerged onto the gray bridge. Fu Xingxuan’s face was flushed, her eyes tender.

“A bath feels so good!” Lo Tian stretched his arms, admiration in his gaze. The Yellow River’s effects were indeed remarkable.

Lo Tian had long controlled the Dragon Spring, and his body bore traces of its sinister aura. After purification by the Yellow River, he felt much improved.

“Wife, wait here; I’ll return tomorrow!” Lo Tian kissed Fu Xingxuan’s cheek before it was time to leave.

“Mmm…” Fu Xingxuan nodded, her eyes filled with reluctance. Though she longed to stay close to Lo Tian, his current strength was not yet sufficient.

Lo Tian chuckled, rising into the air toward the somewhat chaotic sky. His heart also ached with parting.

“Vibrations…” As Lo Tian’s presence appeared in the eighth level of the Ghost Feeding Pavilion, a nine-headed bird approached him immediately, scrutinizing him closely.

“I’ll be leaving now; I’ll feed you tomorrow!” Lo Tian patted the nine-headed bird’s body, its soft feathers pleasant to the touch.

From the eighth level down to the first, Lo Tian emerged from the black tower, appearing before Guo Qiuhai, who had anxiously awaited him.

“Senior Lo, you’ve finally come out! How long did it take?” Guo Qiuhai wiped his cold sweat, convinced Lo Tian had been devoured by the ghosts within.

“I went to spank the Holy Maiden!” Lo Tian chuckled, his eyes flashing anger.

“Ha… Ha… Let’s hurry, Senior Lo!” Guo Qiuhai chuckled nervously. He knew full well he wouldn’t believe Lo Tian’s words.

Chapter 2144: Seize

“Let’s go!” Lo Tian felt invigorated, his entire being transformed. He strode toward the entrance of the third level. Passing by Huo Tianyu’s courtyard, he caught sight of Tianyu standing within.

They exchanged glances, both silently mocking each other without a word. Lo Tian then departed.

“Let you gloat for two more days!” Tianyu watched Lo Tian leave, snorting in disdain before heading toward the Ghost Feeding Pavilion. He soon reached the second level and noticed that the eight-headed snake’s blood had become much denser. Satisfied, he returned to his courtyard.

Lo Tian and Guo Qiuhai exited the second level’s Rotating Hall, swiftly arriving at the thirty-third level where the eight minor heavenly kings and the most elite disciples of the Rotating Hall resided.

“I should find a new place to stay,” Lo Tian felt the thick ghostly qi and the imposing courtyards of the thirty-third level, heading directly for the central eight courtyards.

“Senior Lo is planning to…?” Seeing that Lo Tian had no intention of leaving, Guo Qiuhai’s expression shifted slightly.

“Is that Lo Chen? Why is he here?” The elite disciples’ faces showed confusion.

As Lo Tian appeared, many disciples followed him, their eyes filled with schadenfreude.

Lo Tian soon reached the outer gates of the central eight courtyards, his gaze thoughtful.

“Which one should I take? Wang Heng or Duan Boyang?” Lo Tian murmured, his voice carrying to those around him. This immediately caused a stir.

“Lo Chen is attempting to seize the courtyards of the eight minor heavenly kings!” The crowd instantly understood Lo Tian’s intent, their eyes wide with disbelief.

“Lo Tian!” As soon as Lo Tian appeared, a sharp voice echoed in their ears. The tone was laced with endless resentment.

A figure flew toward Lo Tian, its eyes burning with hostility. Dressed in a combat robe, it carried a long sword, exuding an imposing aura.

Yet, its face, marred by sword scars, ruined the image of a formidable warrior.

“Is that Wang Heng?” The crowd immediately recognized the man, their faces showing surprise.

Wang Heng’s eyes burned with resentment. He had hoped to recover, but after returning a few days ago, his sword scars showed no signs of improvement.

“Ah, a defeated subordinate!”
“What? You want to seek punishment?” Lo Tian’s gaze was contemptuous as he looked at Wang Heng.

Wang Heng’s face darkened, but without revealing his secret, he was no match for Lo Tian. He dared not speak, fearing another defeat and losing face.

“Defeated subordinate, do you wish to avenge? I am always ready. If not, leave my sight; would you like another two scars?” Lo Tian laughed coldly, his gaze scornful toward Wang Heng.

“Ha! Senior Lo, you have time today!” As Lo Tian’s words finished, laughter echoed in his ears. Wang Gang and Qiu Long also emerged from the crowd.

“Little brother Lo, finally remembered your sister?” Su Dan smiled seductively, approaching Lo Tian with alluring eyes.

However, Lo Tian had just left Fu Xingxuan and his fire was largely extinguished. He had recently concluded, so his resistance had increased.

“I came to find a courtyard to stay in!” Lo Tian smelled the fragrance, his gaze laced with amusement.

As Lo Tian’s words finished, Wang Gang’s expressions slightly stiffened. Lo Tian’s intent was clearly to seize the courtyards of the minor heavenly kings.

As for who, it depended on Lo Tian’s mood. Perhaps he would seize theirs.

“Ah, why look for a place to stay? Stay at my place!” Su Dan spoke, her voice still explicit and suggestive.

“Perhaps I really can’t withstand it; you’ll drain me dry…” Lo Tian looked down, seeing a vast expanse of white. His fire reignited.

“Better not,” Lo Tian quickly retreated, inwardly sighing at how demonic Su Dan was. Her seductive skills were truly exceptional.

Su Dan said nothing, instead gazing at Lo Tian with a sorrowful expression. Her eyes were like those of a jilted wife.

Lo Tian’s lips twitched as he stepped out of the crowd, finally arriving at Duan Boyang’s courtyard gate. A smile graced his face.

“Hmph…” Seeing Lo Tian standing at Duan Boyang’s gate, Mo Cheng and Mo Tian sighed deeply. It seemed Lo Tian intended to trouble Duan Boyang.

“Lo Tian!” Duan Boyang had known of Lo Tian’s arrival but hadn’t gone out. He stood within his courtyard, observing.

“What do you want?” Duan Boyang’s face darkened as he gazed at Lo Tian standing there.

“From now on, this courtyard belongs to Lo!”
“If you’re不服, let’s fight!” Lo Tian spoke loudly, a smile on his face but his voice霸道.

“You…” Duan Boyang’s face darkened completely. Lo Tian had come to his doorstep; if he continued to avoid battle, it would be impossible to explain. From now on, he would never hold his head high.

“You what? Get out of my way. Don’t make me act; if I do, you know what happens!” Lo Tian’s face was mocking. He didn’t believe Duan Boyang could hold out.

“Lo Tian, don’t push too hard. I am not someone to be trifled with!”
“If you provoke me, your family will also suffer!” Duan Boyang spoke coldly.

“Die!” However, as soon as Duan Boyang’s words finished, a cold voice echoed in his ears. A figure instantly appeared before him, crimson light flashing as it slashed toward Duan Boyang.

Yes, it was a slash. If it were anyone else, Lo Tian would have struck down, but he had no intention of giving Duan Boyang a chance to live!

“Let’s fight!” Duan Boyang roared, green smoke rising instantly and forming a fist that collided with the descending sword.

“Boom…” The green fist was instantly shattered by one slash. A powerful gust of wind swept between the two.

Wang Gang and others immediately retreated, avoiding the scattered poison gas. Due to the incident at the ninety-ninth level, people had kept a distance from Duan Boyang’s courtyard. Moreover, the disciples at the thirty-third level were elite; no casualties occurred this time.

“Vibrations…” The Dragon Spring swept, striking Duan Boyang’s body and causing him to recoil. The green smoke also clung to Lo Tian, instantly penetrating his pores.

The Reincarnation Heaven Art activated as Lo Tian attempted to expel the toxins. As soon as they entered his body, they ignited, burning away his cultivation.

“Rushing…” The ground instantly turned into a green ocean. Flames burned but carried no heat, quickly extinguishing.

The fire within Lo Tian’s body was also expelled from his body by his formidable cultivation, burning only a small portion of his strength.

“Indeed, he has some skill!” Lo Tian laughed coldly and leapt into the air again toward Duan Boyang.

“He seems stronger!” Seeing Lo Tian expel Duan Boyang’s poison so quickly, Wang Gang and others marveled.

“Damn!” Duan Boyang’s face darkened. Seeing Lo Tian charge toward him, he drew a long spear.

“Ah, you also use a spear!” Lo Tian struck downward with the Dragon Spring. The clash of steel rang out, sending Duan Boyang back dozens of feet.

Before Duan Boyang could steady himself, Lo Tian’s attack came instantly. The Dragon Spring swung repeatedly, slicing toward Duan Boyang.

The sound of collisions echoed constantly as Duan Boyang retreated step by step, no match for Lo Tian.

“Poison Cloud!” Duan Boyang spat out a black mist, forming a dark cloud that enveloped Lo Tian and himself. Raindrops the size of beans fell, corroding everything they touched, instantly turning the ground into a patchwork of craters.

“Vibrations…” Lo Tian halted, raising a barrier with his hands to block the poison rain outside.

But the poison rain rapidly corroded Lo Tian’s barrier, continuing to fall toward him.

Lo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly. The Dragon Spring slashed repeatedly, generating a storm of sword qi that swept up the corrosive poison rain. The storm moved the heavens, instantly sweeping the poison cloud into its vortex.

The Dragon Spring moved, splitting the sky open and sending the massive storm beyond it.

“Go!” Duan Boyang had just gained some advantage. He did not wish to waste it, and a jade bottle appeared in his hand, which he crushed instantly.

“Crack…” The jade bottle shattered. A brown centipede appeared in the crowd, then transformed into a streak of light toward Lo Tian.

“Boom boom boom…”

Another four jade bottles shattered, revealing a purple scorpion, a white toad, a black snake, and a green lizard. They instantly flew out, their bodies expanding rapidly as they rushed toward Lo Tian.

“Five Poisons! Duan Boyang has gathered the Five Poisons!” The faces of Wang Gang and others changed instantly.

“Disgusting creatures. Little brother Lo, defeat them; I hate these insects most!” Su Dan gazed at the five creatures flying toward Lo Tian, her eyes filled with distaste.

“Sss…” As he spoke, the centipede had already reached Lo Tian’s vicinity. Upon nearing, it expanded to dozens of feet, its legs bristling with venomous spines attacking Lo Tian.

“Enjoy it!” Duan Boyang’s face bore a cold smile. His aura rose, and he continuously sent out seals, black qi flying from his hands.

Chapter 2145: Five Poisons Heart-Eroding Array

The sword cut through the air, slicing toward the brown centipede. The clash of steel rang out; the centipede’s body sparkled with fire, instantly repelled by Lo Tian.

As Lo Tian repelled the centipede, the attacks of the other four poisons came instantly. A white tongue extended toward Lo Tian, belonging to the white toad.

“Vibrations…” The black snake’s tail lashed through space, striking Lo Tian fiercely.

The purple scorpion’s tail, with its cold venomous spines, also struck toward Lo Tian. The green lizard spat out a green dragon that enveloped Lo Tian.

Lo Tian punched forward, the collision of three fists creating a single punch aimed at the black snake’s tail. His other hand held the Dragon Spring, slicing toward the poison cloud.

“Boom…” The black snake’s tail was instantly shattered by Lo Tian’s punch. The green dragon was also cut apart, turning into a cloud of green mist.

Lo Tian’s attack was strong, but the scorpion’s venomous spines pierced his formidable body.

The cold spines struck Lo Tian’s back, not piercing through but leaving a blood hole on his back.

“Ss…” Lo Tian inhaled sharply, instantly feeling numbness. Even the Dragon Spring nearly slipped from his grasp.

The wound was not severe, but the scorpion’s venom had successfully entered Lo Tian’s body.

The white tongue wrapped around Lo Tian, pulling him toward the gaping mouth.

“Ten feet… eight feet…” Lo Tian instantly appeared before the open mouth, inhaling a pungent odor.

“Burst…” As the mouth was about to swallow Lo Tian, he finally recovered from his numbness. His arms exerted force, and a roar of dragons echoed from his body—The Heaven Dragon Unbound Art.

Blood mist rose. In the crowd’s shock, the white tongue was instantly severed. The toad felt pain and jumped back with its massive body.

“Die!” Lo Tian roared, leaping into the air and landing on the toad’s body. The Dragon Spring was raised high, its tip piercing into the toad’s head.

“Plop…” Blood splattered onto Lo Tian’s face. He shook his head to prevent the toxic blood from infecting him, then flung it away before leaping into the air.

Plop plop plop…

As Lo Tian left, venomous needles pierced the toad’s body. Corrosion instantly spread over the white toad, making it even more grotesque and causing people to feel nauseous.

“Ss…” The black snake, stirred by its ferocity, lifted its head and attacked Lo Tian with its broken body. Its fangs exuded a thick mist of poison.

The centipede and lizard also rushed toward Lo Tian. Lo Tian roared, slicing with his sword. A brilliant blade of light cut toward the lizard.

“Plop…” The lizard’s tail was instantly severed. This was due to the lizard’s quick reaction, but it quickly regrew its tail.

At the same time, Lo Tian punched the centipede away. The black snake’s fangs also bit into Lo Tian’s body.

Crack…

Lo Tian immediately grabbed the venomous fangs with his hands, a cold expression on his face.

“Let me bite!” Lo Tian’s arms exerted force. Two venomous fangs were instantly snapped, and he tore the entire black snake apart.

Snake blood stained Lo Tian. He appeared like a battle god drenched in blood, but the cold sensation made his face slightly change.

“Hmph…” Lo Tian exhaled, spitting out a cold breath. A wave of coldness instantly invaded him, and his entire body was covered in ice, completely freezing him.

“Kill!” Duan Boyang’s face bore madness. His hand seals were completed, and a black cloud descended from the sky, as if the heavens collapsed, pressing down on Lo Tian.

“Lo Chen is strong, but he is not invulnerable to poisons!” Wang Gang and others sighed, watching the frozen Lo Tian.

“Die! Duan Boyang killed him!” Wang Heng’s heart shouted, his eyes filled with satisfaction.

“Arrogant. He defeated four minor heavenly kings without losing. But one thing defeats another; he was finally beaten by a minor heavenly king!”

“His glory had not lasted long. He was poisoned by Duan Senior, and no one else could unlock it. His life is now in Duan Senior’s hands!” Elite disciples whispered, their faces filled with admiration.

The thunderous sound echoed. The black cloud instantly descended upon Lo Tian, about to press down on him.

“Crack…” In a flash of lightning and thunder, the ice that had frozen Lo Tian began to crack.

“Burst…” The next moment, Lo Tian burst out of the ice. A scorching aura instantly spread. Lo Tian exhaled a cold breath, not thinking twice before slicing with his sword.

A towering blade of light cut through the black cloud. Lo Tian stepped on the ground, leaping into the air and emerging from the cloud, standing atop the sky. His face bore admiration.

“He emerged!” The crowd gasped in astonishment, not expecting Lo Tian to emerge so quickly. Even Wang Gang and others were surprised.

“How is this possible?” Duan Boyang’s face bore disbelief. He deeply knew the terror of his snake, a supreme cold object in the world. Not even an immortal peak could escape so quickly.

“Did he have some secret? The scorpion’s poison was the same!” Duan Boyang trembled. He had not expected Lo Tian to be immune to five poisons.

Seven-colored flames flowed within Lo Tian’s body. Indeed, he had been on the verge of escape but for the seven-colored flames, he would have been crushed.

“Only three left!” Lo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at the centipede and lizard. His face bore coldness.

“Do these insects think they can harm me?” Lo Tian laughed, leaping into the air. His sword flashed, slicing toward the lizard.

“Plop…” This time it was not just the tail but the entire lizard that was severed!

Blood covered the ground. The two segments of the lizard writhed, making people uncomfortable.

The most shocking thing was that the two segments gradually crawled back together, showing signs of healing.

“This lizard, although its poison is the weakest among the five poisons, has the strongest survival ability. Even if you cut it into pieces, it can slowly recover!” Duan Boyang laughed coldly, his fingers moving constantly.

Seeing Duan Boyang’s hand seals, Lo Tian felt a slight tension. He sensed that Duan Boyang was preparing something big.

“Hurry and finish it!” Lo Tian thought to himself. He leapt into the air without waiting for the healing lizard, rushing toward the massive centipede.

Swish swish swish…

A streak of silver light flashed, shooting toward Lo Tian.

Lo Tian blocked with the Dragon Spring. Sparks flew from his front, but they could not stop Lo Tian’s attack. He pressed forward through the rain of needles toward the centipede.

Within ten breaths, Lo Tian reached the centipede’s front. The centipede coiled its massive body and struck Lo Tian with a powerful maw, attempting to tear him apart.

“Is that all?” Lo Tian laughed. He sliced with his sword, cutting the centipede’s head.

Sparks flared again. The massive body flew back. The Dragon Spring only left a wound on the centipede’s head.

“Such hard shells!” Lo Tian’s face showed slight surprise. He watched the centipede approaching again, and the lizard was almost healed. The scorpion’s venomous spines were about to be released again, and Lo Tian felt a growing sense of crisis as Duan Boyang’s hand seals continued.

“Little brother Lo, the joints between each segment of this centipede are its weakness. Its other parts are very hard!” Su Dan smiled, speaking to Lo Tian. It must be said that Su Dan’s words were always laced with seductive allure; anything she said could evoke fantasies.

“Foolish woman, Su Dan, you seek death!” Duan Boyang’s face shifted slightly at Su Dan’s words.

“Thank you, sister. After I finish this scum, I’ll repay you!” Lo Tian laughed and leapt into the air. He stepped onto the massive centipede’s body.

“Plop…” A dull sound echoed. Lo Tian’s eyes flashed with electricity, and the Dragon Spring was raised high before plunging into the centipede’s body.

“Plop…” Lo Tian felt a slight lightness. Blood gushed from the Dragon Spring.

“Ss…” The centipede writhed violently, its body constantly twisting but unable to harm Lo Tian.

Lo Tian withdrew the Dragon Spring. The sword light flashed repeatedly, striking each joint with precision. In an instant, the entire centipede was severed into over a hundred segments.

“Do you have any more tricks? Use them!” Lo Tian leapt into the air, rushing toward Duan Boyang. As he flew, he threw out the Dragon Spring, pinning the scorpion to the ground.

“Five Poisons Heart-Eroding Array!” Duan Boyang’s face darkened. He slammed his hand onto the ground.

The vibrations spread, and the five corpses of the Five Poisons slowly moved. Blood flowed from their bodies.

“Boom boom boom…” The sound of explosions echoed, and five gray auras rose instantly, gathering above Lo Tian.

The five gray figures were the Five Poisons. Now they appeared in another form, merging into five streaks of light that enveloped Lo Tian.

“Vibrations…” The aura surged, instantly wrapping Lo Tian. Five-colored waves of qi swept in, and terrifying poison gas rushed into Lo Tian’s body.

Dizziness. Lo Tian’s first feeling was dizziness, and his heart pounded violently.

Chapter 2146: Demon Yang

“Boom boom boom…” His heart pounded violently. A wave of weakness filled his entire body, making Lo Tian’s face pale. He felt as if something had invaded him, slowly consuming his body.

“Do you feel weak?”
“If you kneel before me now and beg, I will unlock the array. If you delay longer, the poison will attack your heart; there’ll be no salvation!” Duan Boyang’s face bore a smile as he gazed at Lo Tian enveloped in five-colored poison mist, speaking loudly.

“We should have anticipated this. Duan Boyang gathered the Five Poisons; he must use this array!”
“But the cost of this Five Poisons Heart-Eroding Array is great. The Five Poisons are rare treasures; even if they die, they will be reborn. However, Duan Boyang used the Five Poisons Heart-Eroding Array; these Five Poisons will be completely dead!” Several minor heavenly kings whispered, their faces filled with admiration.

“This array is impossible to unlock! The poison is not as霸道 as the Tian Luo Poison, but it’s still difficult for anyone to unlock!” People whispered, their gazes on Duan Boyang.

If compared solely by strength, Duan Boyang was no match for any of them. But with poison, he became terrifyingly formidable. This was why they feared Duan Boyang—poison is unpredictable and hard to guard against.

No matter how strong you are, if poisoned, even if not dying, you’ll be stripped of a layer of skin.

At this moment, Lo Tian’s state was that he felt completely weak. He could feel the terrifying poison eroding his entire body.

Sometimes, he had no sensation; sometimes, it felt like falling into an icy abyss; sometimes, it felt as if burned by fire. Five poisons, like one but able to separate, eroded Lo Tian.

Seven-colored flames surged, countering the powerful poison. Lo Tian’s face improved slightly, but the terrifying poison still eroded him—only a matter of speed.

“Roar…” The Dragon Elephant Sealing Prison was also unleashed by Lo Tian, sealing the terrifying poison.

With the Dragon Elephant Sealing Prison’s suppression, Lo Tian’s strength recovered considerably. Without hesitation, he sliced with his sword toward the five-colored barrier.

“Crack…” The Dragon Spring collided with the five-colored barrier, leaving a sword mark but not breaking it.

“Useless. This barrier operates according to the Five Elements’ mutual generation. No matter how strong your strength is, you cannot break this array!” Duan Boyang’s face bore contempt as he watched Lo Tian slicing the array like a fool.

“Is that so? It’s because of the Five Elements’ mutual generation!” Lo Tian smiled, his mind suddenly understanding. This array was based on the Five Elements’ mutual generation. However, the poison within his body was based on the Five Elements’ mutual destruction—five ultimate poisons that destroyed each other, creating a new poison!

“Five Elements’ mutual generation. I’ve lived too long to not notice!” Lo Tian shook his head lightly, becoming calm and composed. His gaze turned toward the five-colored barrier.

“Did he go mad? He gave up?” Seeing Lo Tian standing there without moving, people began to murmur.

“Ha! That’s right. You fool, hurry and beg me. This is all your doing; you insisted on being hostile to me, pushing too hard!” Duan Boyang laughed triumphantly. His hands moved, and a black sun descended from the sky toward Lo Tian.

“Using Five Elements’ mutual generation and destruction before me, you are truly…” Lo Tian’s eyes flashed like lightning. He wielded the Dragon Spring again.

“Vibrations…” Five sword glows instantly flew from Lo Tian’s hands toward the swirling barrier.

“Truly overconfident!” Duan Boyang’s face bore a cold smile. However, before he could finish speaking, his laughter abruptly ceased.

“Crack…” Five cracks appeared on the five-colored barrier. The powerful barrier shattered, turning into fragments that fell to the ground.

“Breakthrough! My god, he was so strained before but now broke through!” People gasped in astonishment.

“Because I am the ancestor of Five Elements’ mutual generation!” Lo Tian roared, punching forward. The heavens thundered as his punch struck the black sun.

The thunderous sound echoed. The black sun was instantly shattered by Lo Tian’s punch. Lo Tian, his aura overwhelming, stood atop the sky, descending toward Duan Boyang.

The sword intent was terrifying. It cut through the black sky, slicing toward Duan Boyang. Lo Tian followed the sword light toward Duan Boyang.

“Damn!” Duan Boyang’s face instantly darkened. He wished to hit himself twice, regretting his careless words.

Lo Tian’s ability to break the array was clearly because he had revealed the array’s mechanism. Thus, Lo Tian could break it so quickly. Otherwise, with his previous speed, he would have never broken the Five Poisons Heart-Eroding Array.

But it was too late now. The terrifying sword light had already arrived, and Duan Boyang could only grit his teeth and endure. He pulled out a black spear.

“Crack…” Thunder clashed with the black spear, and Duan Boyang spat blood, his body spinning.

“Vibrations…” Before Duan Boyang could steady himself, Lo Tian’s second sword arrived. The great sword struck the spear.

The sound of collisions echoed constantly, and Lo Tian further suppressed Duan Boyang. This time, the suppression was even more severe, with Duan Boyang spitting blood repeatedly.

“This courtyard is yours!” Duan Boyang roared. Within a moment, he was in disarray, his spear covered with sword marks and his palms cracked. He seemed about to give up.

“Don’t need it!” Lo Tian’s cold voice echoed, his hands continuously striking. His face remained pale, and the Dragon Spring swung repeatedly.

Numerous buildings in the courtyard shattered under their collisions. Although Lo Tian was poisoned, he did not care.

“Lo Chen, don’t force me!” Duan Boyang spat blood. His spear was instantly shattered by Lo Tian.

“You only know this one phrase!” Lo Tian’s entire being radiated killing intent, continuously striking. Each sword strike was relentless.

“Lo Chen, you are trying to kill!” The crowd, including the minor heavenly kings, bore expressions of disbelief. They felt Lo Tian’s intense killing intent.

“Little brother Lo, stay calm! These insects are not for anyone!” Su Dan shouted, her voice no longer seductive.

“Lo Chen, we are relatives! You cannot do this to me. My sister married your father! I am also your elder!” Duan Boyang’s voice was filled with desperation, finally giving up and playing the family card.

“Go to hell! You still took advantage of me!” Duan Boyang’s words were enough. Lo Tian’s killing intent became even more intense.

Thinking of Luo Shui’s tragic fate and Luo Chen’s death, Lo Tian had no hesitation at all.

“Plop…” Lo Tian kicked Duan Boyang away, catching his breath. He had used his cultivation to accelerate the poison’s erosion.

“Lo Chen, I’ll give you an antidote. This courtyard is also yours. How about it?” Duan Boyang’s heart ached with regret. He had been foolish, bringing up the issue he should not have. His words about hatred were clearly pouring oil on fire.

“I said I don’t need it!” Lo Tian laughed coldly, raising his hand. A gourd fell into his hands.

Lo Tian lifted his head and drank. No one knew what was inside the gourd.

“Yellow River!” This gourd had been a gift from Jiu Jianxian Jiang Taibai. Later, it was given to Lo Tian. While in the Reincarnation Hell, he had casually filled it with a gourd of Yellow River. The Yellow River has the power to purify souls, naturally capable of eliminating poison.
