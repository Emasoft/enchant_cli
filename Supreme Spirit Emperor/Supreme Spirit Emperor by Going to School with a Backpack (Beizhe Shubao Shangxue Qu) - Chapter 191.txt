“Fine!” Lu Tian sighed helplessly, acknowledging that Gu Qianxue’s words did make sense. He forcibly suppressed his desires, adjusted his attire, and headed toward the door of Gu Qianxue’s room. He failed to notice a glimmer of purity in her eyes.

Chapter 872: Driven to Madness

Lu Tian slowly stepped into the second room, striding confidently inside. He saw Leng Qiuchan seated within, her gaze soft as she met his.

Their eyes locked, and Leng Qiuchan felt the tenderness in Lu Tian’s gaze. She instinctively leaned into his embrace, causing Lu Tian’s eyes to brighten. Overcome with emotion, he kissed her.

“Hum…” The two of them could be considered novices, but the moment their lips met, their minds went blank.

Lu Tian, as a man, knew he needed to take the initiative. His hands grew restless.

Leng Qiuchan surrendered completely, and when she regained clarity, she found herself disheveled, lying motionless in his arms. Yet Lu Tian’s touch was relentless.

But before she could react, the sisters’ pact resurfaced in her mind. She pushed Lu Tian away.

At that moment, Lu Tian was caught off guard, cursing the design of the garment. The sudden push sent him tumbling out into the courtyard.

“Damn… what’s going on?” Lu Tian frowned, bewildered. Why had he been thrown out?

“Be a good boy and go to Sister Si Xi’s room. She’s already given you a child; she needs you more tonight!” Leng Qiuchan’s voice echoed in his mind, and Lu Tian let out a bitter smile. “The bond between wives is both a blessing and a curse!”

As Leng Qiuchan’s voice faded, Lu Tian’s shoes and the red overcoat he’d removed were tossed out. A surge of primordial power sealed the door once more.

Lu Tian sensed something was amiss. He quickly put on his clothes and entered the third room, his expression darkening. He wanted to curse but held back.

Inside, Jiang Sixi sat calmly, cradling her daughter Luo Xiting while nursing her. Her maternal radiance stirred Lu Tian’s blood.

“Tonight I can’t stay with you, Xiting is clingy. Go to Qianxue or Qiuchan,” Jiang Sixi said without hesitation.

Lu Tian sighed, shaking his head. Even if he had done it with her, he couldn’t bring himself to do so in front of Xiting. Though the child was only weeks old, her intelligence was akin to that of a toddler—how could he do it in front of his daughter?

“Damn…” Lu Tian cursed, gazing at Jiang Sixi with a hint of resentment.

“Did you all conspire to keep me from…?” Lu Tian gritted his teeth, addressing Jiang Sixi.

“Indeed. What’s your problem? You think you can defy me?” Jiang Sixi’s expression darkened, a cold snort escaping her.

“No… I dare not…” Lu Tian bowed like a servant and left Jiang Sixi’s room respectfully.

“With Xiting here, I can’t even dream of her. Seems I’ll have to work on Qianxue and Qiuchan,” Lu Tian muttered, striding toward Leng Qiuchan’s room again.

“Didn’t I tell you to go to Sister Si Xi?” Leng Qiuchan’s voice echoed from her room, the door unopened.

“Go to them instead…” Gu Qianxue’s voice echoed similarly, the door sealed shut.

“Damn…” Lu Tian didn’t give up. All night long, he wandered outside Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan’s rooms, his voice hoarse. Yet both women refused to open the door, leaving him fuming.

“Ugh…” Lu Tian sighed deeply, changing his form to exit the mansion. He forced a composed expression; after all, it was his wedding night, and being locked out was too humiliating.

“Need to think of a plan,” Lu Tian mused, stepping outside.

Though he had left yesterday, the others remained lively—eager to celebrate his joy and their survival. The Five Elements Sect was still bustling.

Seeing Lu Tian step out with a composed demeanor, everyone smiled, pulling him into the banquet again.

“Good for you, kid! Finally a man!” Lei Yong and Ji Chen cheered.

Lu Tian’s eyes gleamed with pride, but inwardly he cursed: “What the hell? Besides that one time with Sixi, I’ve never had experience!”

“Blindly?” Lu Tian’s gaze lit up, turning to Gu Lei. The more he thought, the happier he became, his lips curling into a grin.

Another day passed. As dusk approached, Lu Tian stealthily pulled Gu Lei aside, finding a secluded spot. His eyes gleamed as he stared at Gu Lei.

“Kid, now I’m your brother-in-law. You want my sister to be happy, right?” Lu Tian’s words confused Gu Lei.

“Brother, just say it. Did you offend my sister? Don’t worry, I won’t help you…” Gu Lei spoke bluntly, his voice loud but lacking backbone.

“Damn… what are you talking about? I mean, give me that medicine!” Lu Tian finally gave in, sacrificing his pride for tonight’s happiness.

“Brother, you’ve already got a daughter… why do you need that medicine?” Gu Lei’s face showed disbelief. He hadn’t expected Lu Tian to ask for such a thing.

“Ugh… I’ve got no choice but to suffer!” Lu Tian hurriedly replied, not wanting to argue further.

Seeing Lu Tian’s pained expression, Gu Lei felt pity. He gently patted Lu Tian’s shoulder: “Don’t worry, brother. I’ll help.”

Gu Lei pulled out three pills from his storage bag and handed them to Lu Tian: “Remember, one at a time. Don’t overdo it!”

Lu Tian nodded and vanished from Gu Lei’s sight, excitement in his eyes.

“Ugh… Lu Tian is pitiable. Even with such power, he has issues. Could it be the injury from the Netherworld?” Gu Lei shook his head, sighing.

Meanwhile, Lu Tian remained unaware he had been mistaken for impotent by Gu Lei. He eagerly mixed the three pills into his drink and entered Gu Qianxue’s room.

Gu Qianxue had been harsh yesterday, but she now allowed Lu Tian into her room.

“Qianxue, since we’re married, shouldn’t we share a cup of wine?” Lu Tian smiled tenderly, holding two cups. His gaze was deep.

Seeing his demeanor, Gu Qianxue refused no longer. They both drank the wine, her face flushed.

After Lu Tian’s persistent requests, they finished an entire pot. Gu Qianxue’s face was flushed.

Lu Tian’s breath grew urgent, his gaze on her rosy cheeks. He couldn’t resist.

“Qianxue…” Lu Tian felt the medicine’s effect, his heart elated.

“Hmm? What is it?” Gu Qianxue looked at him, puzzled. She felt Lu Tian was acting strangely.

“Qianxue, aren’t you hot?” Lu Tian was equally confused. He clearly felt a reaction, yet she seemed unaffected.

“No… I’m fine. That little wine won’t get me drunk. Don’t dream!” Gu Qianxue glared at him, a hint of disdain.

“Damn…” Lu Tian felt something was off. He recalled the previous night with Jiang Sixi, where he couldn’t resist. Now, though he felt desire, he could control it.

“Did Gu Lei give me the wrong medicine?” Lu Tian thought back. Suddenly, he realized Gu Lei’s pitying gaze—this was a big problem.

“Damn you, Gu Lei! You bastard!” Lu Tian cursed. He now understood why this happened. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead.

“Lu Tian, what’s wrong?” Gu Qianxue noticed his rising temperature and worry. She gently touched his forehead.

“What the hell do I do now!” Lu Tian was certain Gu Lei had given him something other than what he wanted. It must have been a mistake. Otherwise, Gu Qianxue wouldn’t show no reaction.

He wanted to strangle Gu Lei. He had longed for her but couldn’t have her—now this was like oil on fire.

“Qianxue, I can’t… help me…” Lu Tian sighed, lying on the bed, unwilling to rise.

“Huh?” Seeing Lu Tian’s red face, Gu Qianxue was utterly flustered. When had she seen him like this?

“I want…” Lu Tian’s face was red, his voice weak. He truly felt unbearable, as if exploding.

“Qiuchan, Sixi… come quickly!” Gu Qianxue’s face showed urgency, shouting outside.

In an instant, Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan appeared in Gu Qianxue’s room. Seeing Lu Tian’s red face, they showed concern.

Upon entering, Gu Qianxue looked to them as a savior, recounting the events.

Chapter 873: Finally Conquered

In Gu Qianxue’s room, Lu Tian had nearly lost consciousness. His face was red. Gu Lei had told him one pill sufficed, but Lu Tian mixed all three into water. Though harmless to women, this medicine was too much for men.

Lu Tian muttered continuously. The three women were desperate. Jiang Sixi had experience; seeing Lu Tian’s state, it was similar to her own. Her face turned red.

“He must have taken that medicine!” Jiang Sixi blushed, her words filling the room with intimacy.

Though uncomfortable, Lu Tian’s consciousness remained. Hearing Jiang Sixi’s words, he cheered again, grabbing the nearest Gu Qianxue and pulling her into his arms.

Hearing Jiang Sixi’s words, Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan were startled. They knew the terror of aphrodisiacs and how to neutralize them.

“What should we do, Sister Sixi? You’ve already been with Lu Tian. Perhaps you should help him detoxify!” Gu Qianxue, flushed from Lu Tian’s touch, spoke hesitantly.

Hearing Gu Qianxue’s words, Jiang Sixi blushed. She recalled that night, her eyes showing a bitter smile: “I can’t endure it myself!”

“Roar!” Lu Tian roared, his divine power enveloping the three women, pulling them all onto the bed.

“Ah…” A scream echoed. The three women instinctively resisted but ultimately cared for Lu Tian, recalling his poisoning. They closed their eyes, not daring to look at the other two women, allowing Lu Tian to act freely.

Passion bloomed. One night passed quietly. Morning sunlight filtered into the large room. Lu Tian slowly opened his eyes, seeing three exquisite wives curled like kittens. A smile graced his lips.

“Hah! You still can’t handle me!” Though he had spent the night, Lu Tian remained vigorous, no signs of fatigue. His energy even rose.

But seeing his exhausted wives, Lu Tian’s face showed tenderness. He gently kissed each of their faces: “From now on, you are truly my wife. Who dares touch you, must first step over my corpse!”

As Lu Tian kissed and whispered, the three women awoke. Initially confused, they then glared at Lu Tian, making his neck shrink slightly.

“Ah…” A mournful cry pierced the sky, echoing through the Five Elements Sect. People nearby were startled, their faces puzzled.

Lu Tian’s ears were twisted again. A white hand clutched his waist tightly.

“Tell me, what happened yesterday? Where did you get that thing!” The three women spoke simultaneously but gasped upon realizing they were naked, quickly dressing.

Lu Tian took the chance to dress and escape. But the three women wouldn’t let him go.

Under pressure, Lu Tian confessed everything but shifted all blame to Gu Lei.

This time, Lu Tian truly felt refreshed as he exited the door, a satisfied smile on his face. His appearance remained youthful but his aura had become more stable.

The Five Elements Sect was still lively, though quieter than before. Only those close to Lu Tian remained.

“Brother, how was it? Did you recover? If you have any more problems, I’ll help without side effects!” Gu Lei sneaked up behind Lu Tian, a knowing smile on his face.

Lu Tian was initially angry but remembered his success and having sold Gu Lei out. He nodded slightly: “Thanks, brother!”

“Haha! No need for thanks. We’re brothers; no need to be so polite!” Gu Lei smiled proudly, satisfied with his medicine.

“Gu Lei, come here!” Just as Gu Lei was proud, Gu Qianxue’s furious voice echoed in his mind. He shivered, puzzled, looking at Lu Tian.

“You sister might be excited… thank you!” Lu Tian remained calm, patting Gu Lei’s shoulder gently.

Hearing this, Gu Lei nodded. He had cured Lu Tian and solved a big problem for the four of them. His face showed pride, vanishing like wind toward the back mountain to meet Gu Qianxue’s praise.

“Take care, brother!” Lu Tian sighed compassionately at Gu Lei’s proud face.

From that day on, the Five Elements Sect echoed with mournful cries. The disciples grimaced, sighing inwardly at the torment.

Time passed slowly. Seven days later, the Five Elements Sect returned to calmness. Lu Tian’s wedding storm had finally passed.

During these seven days, Lu Tian lived comfortably—spending time with his parents, playing with Xiting, and cherishing his three wives.

“This life is truly good!” Lu Tian held Xiting in his arms, standing on a high peak, gazing at the entire Tianyuan Continent.

His daughter’s face was innocent. Though only weeks old, her eyes held a lively glint, playing with a jade pendant.

This was the Nourishing Soul Jade he carried daily, once used to nurture Chen Yunting’s soul fragment. He had cherished it, and no one else had touched it except his beloved daughter.

Seeing her hold the jade, Lu Tian’s face softened: “Yunting, where are you?”

As Lu Tian mourned, the Nourishing Soul Jade on Xiting’s hand emitted a soft green light. Lu Tian’s eyes flickered, gazing at his daughter.

“Big sister! Father, I saw a big sister!” Xiting’s plump face showed excitement. She pointed at the jade, speaking to Lu Tian.

“Huh?” Lu Tian looked up but saw no big sister.

“The big sister left, following a large passage into a woman’s body!” Xiting ignored Lu Tian, as if discovering something fun.

Lu Tian was startled. How could his daughter see it when he couldn’t?

“Xiting! Xiting!” Lu Tian tried to call her out of this strange state. He didn’t know if it was good or bad.

But he found she seemed possessed, ignoring him. Her eyes even showed a hint of blue, gazing into the distance.

Lu Tian was terrified. He began to examine Xiting’s body but found nothing unusual—everything normal.

After an hour, Xiting returned from the strange state. Her face showed excitement, dancing and telling Lu Tian about what she saw.

“Soul-Perceiving Body!” Lu Tian recalled an ancient text in the Qinglong Sect about a powerful body type. His face showed excitement.

The Soul-Perceiving Body not only accelerated cultivation but also allowed seeing post-death reincarnations. Though Xiting hadn’t fully mastered it, she had glimpsed a fragment of reincarnation.

The Nourishing Soul Jade once nurtured Chen Yunting’s soul. Clearly, Xiting’s “big sister” was likely Chen Yunting’s residual soul.

With this clue, how could Lu Tian not be excited? He had planned to say goodbye to his family and wander the domains to find Chen Yunting. Now, his daughter had a clue—this was better than blindly searching.

Lu Tian kissed Xiting’s face: “You are truly my little blessing! Haha!”

Lu Tian laughed aloud, tears falling. Xiting looked at her father confusedly, sighing inwardly: “Is my father crazy?”

Soon, Lu Tian gathered everyone, recounting Xiting’s experience. The group was amazed and praised her future achievements.

Nine-element body type, half-step saint’s three drops of blood, and Wan Lingkong’s array nurturing—now with a Soul-Perceiving Body, her future achievements were inevitable.

“What will you do?” Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sixi knew Lu Tian’s intention but still asked.

“Sorry, Yunting is my heartache. From Xiting’s account, though uncertain where she reincarnated, it was definitely the south! I plan to head south until I find Yunting!” Lu Tian’s face showed regret, addressing his three wives.

Though newlywed, leaving them and Xiting was awkward. But Lu Tian couldn’t wait a moment longer; each day risked unforeseen changes.

“I’m going with you!” The three women spoke in unison, their voices firm. They wouldn’t let him go.

Chapter 874: Southward Journey

In the Five Elements Sect, a group surrounded Lu Tian and his four wives. Their faces showed eagerness to join Lu Tian’s journey.

“I’m going!” Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sixi spoke in unison, their voices firm. They gazed at Lu Tian.

“Ugh…” Lu Tian shook his head helplessly. He had anticipated this. The three women’s determined eyes meant they were set.

The journey’s dangers were obvious, even crossing domains. Lu Tian didn’t want them to accompany him but said gently: “Be good, I’ll return soon!”

His words didn’t sway the three women. They shook their heads, still resolute.

“Sixi, you’re still the sect leader of Tianyuan. Stay. Qianxue and Qiuchan, your strength isn’t enough. Stay too!” Lu Xiong and Lu Nantian spoke, their voices authoritative.

“Indeed. This kid’s lucky; no problem!” Zhang Qiuyue also supported her son.

Hearing this, Gu Qianxue and the others fell silent. They could ignore Lu Tian’s words but couldn’t defy their elders. Their reasoning was sound.

“Chance!” Lu Tian thought, finalizing the plan: “Don’t worry. I’ll leave my soul lamp. If anything happens, you’ll know immediately!”

Under everyone’s persuasion, the three women nodded, agreeing to Lu Tian’s decision.

“Son has changed a lot. He used to decide things alone, but now he consults others. This marriage was worth it!” Lu Nantian sighed.

“Your clan is like this—stubborn as a mule. Who can hold you back?” Zhang Qiuyue frowned, recalling Lu Nantian’s past.

Everything decided, Lu Tian spent one more night with his three wives. He left a soul lamp and summoned the Minguo beast before everyone.

“Master, you’ve taken that monster from the Ming River!” Jiang Yimeng and others who had entered the Fengshen Continent marveled, gazing at the massive, fierce Minguo beast. They remembered its power—Lu Tian had nearly been devoured by it.

“Don’t act dead! You survived those two attacks, thanks to my luck. What else do you have to complain about? Let my people feel the essence!” Lu Tian smiled, watching the Minguo beast ignoring him.

“Actually, it has character,” Lu Tian observed the silent beast. “A eight-source supreme Minguo beast, now I can kill it with one palm. If not for its essence helping Tianyuan Continent’s people improve quickly, I’d have killed it already.”

“Did you think I couldn’t handle you?” Lu Tian snorted. Since talking didn’t work, only force would.

Lu Tian said, a golden hand凝聚, grabbing the Minguo beast’s massive body and lifting it into the Five Elements Sect’s sky.

“What is Lu Tian doing?” People wondered, watching him rudely lift the Minguo beast into the sky.

Lu Tian ignored their amazement, punching the Minguo beast’s belly. The powerful shock made its eight faces show intense pain.

“What are you doing!” The Minguo beast finally opened its eyes, growling at Lu Tian, fear in its gaze.

“Submit!” Lu Tian ignored it, punching again. The terrifying shock made the Five Elements Sect’s disciples shocked, watching Lu Tian’s overwhelming power.

“Peng… peng…” The echoing sounds continued in the sky. Gray scales fell from the sky, making some domain-尊 disciples happy, rushing to collect them.

These disciples weren’t like Lu Tian; they were ordinary Five Elements Sect members. The scales of an eight-source beast were precious.

The Five Elements Sect glowed with light. Lu Tian continuously battered the Minguo beast, leaving people in awe.

“Submit… submit… you’re my ancestor. Do whatever you want!” Blood fell from the sky like a blood rain, exciting the Five Elements Sect disciples.

“Why endure this suffering!” Lu Tian smiled. He summoned a series of seals, binding the Minguo beast’s body and merging it into its essence.

The Minguo beast didn’t resist, knowing it had no chance against this demon.

“Hum…” A strange vibration spread. A mysterious connection formed between Lu Tian and the Minguo beast. He pointed, a golden blood drop fell on Jiang Sixi’s forehead.

“Sixi, this beast is yours!” Lu Tian grabbed the Minguo beast and swung it.

The massive body of the Minguo beast, after Lu Tian’s swing, became a gray streak, plunging into the Ming River of the ancient仙gud continent. It splashed a large wave.

“This beast’s body allows essence感悟, enabling quick entry into the nine-source supreme realm. Who feels it first is up to you!” Lu Tian smiled, addressing Jiang Sixi.

Hearing this, people’s faces showed joy. Having such a treasure would compensate for Tianyuan Continent’s time shortage.

After this, Lu Tian sighed deeply. He pulled his three wives up and exited the crowd’s sight. As he left, he knew they’d miss him.

……
Morning came. Lu Tian quietly got up from the bed, gently kissed each of the three women’s cheeks, then went to his daughter’s room.

The child was restless but now asleep. Her fingers were in her mouth, suckling, occasionally smiling.

“Father is leaving…” Lu Tian covered Xiting with a blanket, whispering. His voice carried deep longing.

Lu Tian wished to live forever with his wife, parents, and brothers. But he couldn’t overcome the inner barrier; some things had to be done.

He sighed, and his figure vanished from Xiting’s room, appearing in the Five Elements Sect’s sky. He gazed at the busy disciples, a soft expression on his face. He thought of the past hardships of the Four Sacred Stars and wore a cold look.

“Guard what needs guarding. I must become stronger!” Lu Tian’s voice carried determination.

“Hum…” A vibration spread. A young figure appeared before Lu Tian, making him slightly startled.

“Longbao… Longjie?” Lu Tian’s face showed confusion. What did Longjie want?

“Brother, take me with you! I want… to know my past!” Longjie’s face showed determination. His eyes were bright.

Longjie’s talent was extraordinary. Since the seal on Tianyuan Continent was lifted, his cultivation had soared rapidly, reaching six-source heavenly supreme.

Seeing Longjie’s determined gaze, Lu Tian sighed. He had always considered Longjie his younger brother and wouldn’t let him suffer any harm.

But seeing Longjie’s resolve, Lu Tian knew he couldn’t stop him. He nodded slightly.

His current strength could protect Longjie unless meeting a saint. Plus, the Nirvana Dragon Seal existed. If needed, he could store Longjie in it and escape.

After deciding, Lu Tian and Longjie became a streak of light, appearing outside the Tianyuan Continent. They gazed at the vast continent, Lu Tian’s face showing softness. He waved his hand, summoning an ancient warship beneath the stars.

Since Tianyuan needed strength, Lu Tian left Nan Gong Yuching there but asked for an ancient warship. It was suitable for crossing domains.

They boarded the empty ancient ship. The black sails rose without wind, and the massive vessel flew southward.

“First search in the Four Sacred Stars domain, then others!” Lu Tian whispered. Though hope was slim in the Four Sacred Stars, he wouldn’t miss any clues.

Longjie was diligent. Upon boarding the ship, he started cultivating immediately. Lu Tian’s vast spiritual sense spread outward while controlling the ship through space. He was confident that even if Chen Yunting changed appearance, he’d sense her within his spiritual range.

After a month of circling the Four Sacred Stars domain, Lu Tian and Longjie found nothing. They gave up on it and flew south.

The more they flew south, the hotter the air became. Lu Tian knew the southern end of the Four Sacred Stars domain was the Endless Flame Domain, separated by endless celestial fire. Usually, even heavenly supreme strength couldn’t cross domains.

After seven days of flight, Lu Tian and Longjie stood on the ancient ship, seeing the endless fire sea. They marveled at this natural barrier’s power.

Chapter 875: The Endless Flame Domain

Under the endless stars, colorful flames continuously exhaled. The terrifying temperature burned through surrounding space, leaving no stars around it. Such heat would burn even stars.

On the ancient ship, Longjie’s face dripped sweat. He gazed at the fire sea with a serious expression. He felt the danger it brought.

Not just the fire itself, but the flames’ temperature was no threat to Longjie, who had reached seven-source in a month. The real danger came from something terrifying within the fire sea, unsettling his mind.

Lu Tian’s eyes also showed seriousness. Though a half-step saint, he felt a subtle danger invading his mind.

“Let’s go! Let’s see what this flame domain has!” Lu Tian smiled, controlling the ship into the fire.

“Rustle…” The massive flames continuously attacked the ship’s barriers, trying to swallow Lu Tian and Longjie.

But this ancient ship was no ordinary vessel. It was the treasure of Star River Four Thieves. Even against the rising flames, it showed no damage.

Fortunately, no dangerous creatures or hazards were found. After half a month of flight, Lu Tian felt the temperature slowly decreasing. His spiritual sense also detected human presence.

“Huh?” Lu Tian’s face showed curiosity. His spiritual sense sensed three eight-source supreme beings, naked and seated in the fire sea, their bodies constantly battered by flames.

“Cultivating body with fire—clever idea!” Longjie’s eyes glowed, showing interest.

Lu Tian noticed Longjie’s interest. Though the flames had little effect on his body, they were beneficial for Longjie. The Dragon Clan naturally possessed strong bodies; refining them with flames comparable to celestial fire would greatly benefit Longjie.

The three seated in the fire sea sensed Lu Tian and Longjie’s presence. The massive ancient ship was too eye-catching.

“Friends, did you cross from the other end of this flame domain?” A muscular man asked, his face showing amazement. He gazed at Lu Tian with a hint of seriousness.

Though he couldn’t sense Lu Tian’s cultivation, the man was an independent cultivator. He instinctively felt Lu Tian wasn’t easy to provoke.

“Indeed, we’re from the Four Sacred Stars domain. I suppose you’ve heard of it?” Lu Tian was cautious, though he had strong power. He didn’t know if the flame domain had any powerful beings.
