“Not interested. Get lost, don’t waste my time!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes flickered with interest; it had been a long time since he’d gambled.

“You’re too scared to fight. What excuse are you making?” Liu Yangwei sneered, his gaze fixed on Ye Liangchen.

“Come on, let’s play. Are you afraid of me, you impotent fool!” Ye Liangchen roared, his face flushed red with anger.

Luo Tian and Xuan Dan exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with wry smiles. They hadn’t expected Ye Liangchen’s gambling addiction to be so intense, that he’d immediately accept the challenge when provoked.

“Whatever you want to bet. How much? Today, my esteemed Ye Liangchen will play with you!” Ye Liangchen sneered, addressing Liu Yangwei.

“Let’s battle beasts. I heard the Battle Arena recently received some formidable fierce beasts,” Liu Yangwei said, his eyes gleaming with determination.

“Come on, Tian. Let’s take a tour before leaving!” Ye Liangchen grabbed Luo Tian’s arm and followed Liu Yangwei toward the Battle Arena.

“Let’s go,” Luo Tian sighed. Since Ye Liangchen had already agreed, he wouldn’t refuse him the favor.

Not long after, the group arrived at the Battle Arena in Huantian City. As they entered, a fierce aura immediately struck their senses.

On the high platform, several fierce beasts clashed violently, with thunderous roars echoing constantly. Around the arena were rows of seats where people sat watching the beasts fight, occasionally shouting praises.

“Move aside, you scum! Today I’m taking over the arena!” Liu Yangwei bellowed upon entering, tossing several storage bags to the attendant.

“What are you? You think you can take over the arena?” A voice cursed, but when they saw it was Liu Yangwei and Ye Liangchen, the crowd murmured in low voices.

“Those two masters again. This will be a good show!” The people sighed, their gazes fixed on Ye Liangchen and Liu Yangwei.

“Don’t know how many Xian Qi Stones Ye’s little lord will give to Liu’s little master this time!” In the chaos, participants in the battle quickly evacuated, taking seats around the arena. Those waiting in line also left to make space for Ye Liangchen and Liu Yangwei.

“Come on, Ye Liangchen. Let’s choose beasts,” Liu Yangwei called to Ye Liangchen, clearly no stranger to the Battle Arena.

“You stay here. I’ll choose beasts. When I win this impotent fool, I’ll treat you to a good time!” Ye Liangchen rubbed his hands, heading toward the enclosure where fierce beasts were kept.

“Liangchen, I’ll go with you. I have some knowledge about fierce beasts,” Luo Tian smiled, following Ye Liangchen.

Though he didn’t know Liu Yangwei’s tricks, Luo Tian knew that nine out of ten bets were rigged. Since Liu Yangwei had chosen to battle beasts, he must have his own confidence.

“Good,” Ye Liangchen nodded. He recalled how Luo Tian had dripped a single drop of blood on an egg, making it powerful. That egg was now hatched in Star River Mansion.

As they arrived at the beast selection area, iron cages appeared before Luo Tian. The cages radiated array fluctuations.

Beasts lay in the cages—some wounded, others bleeding. Luo Tian sighed deeply, feeling a wave of sorrow.

These beasts were all in the Heavenly Dao Realm. In仙界 (Xian World), fierce beasts were slightly better than ghosts. Heavenly Immortals could speak, while True Immortals could transform into human forms.

“Dog, which beast do you think is stronger?” Luo Tian asked the fox on his shoulder, Diao Dezhu.

Chapter 1907: The Grand Gamble

“Sigh…”

“I didn’t expect fierce beasts to hold such a low status in the Xian World,” Diao Dezhu sighed, watching the beasts locked like animals. His heart felt uneasy.

Each cage had a clear price tag—some costing several million Xian Qi Stones, others up to ten million. Participants could choose a beast and fight with it; the beast’s life was entirely under the buyer’s control. They could take it home or sell it back to the arena at half price.

Luo Tian, despite his desire to rescue these beasts, lacked the power. With so many beasts, he couldn’t afford them—no sect could either.

“How about it, Tian? Any beast you like?” Ye Liangchen kept scanning the area. He approached a massive cage holding a tiger with black and white stripes, its golden eyes radiating an intimidating aura.

“Most are similar,” Luo Tian muttered, scanning the beasts. He stopped at a small cage holding a gray bird-like beast, its eyes closed and emitting faint energy. Its feathers were messy, resembling a larger sparrow.

At first glance, the bird was almost invisible. But Luo Tian noticed its uniqueness—no wounds on it. In the Battle Arena, a beast without injuries meant it had been ignored for years.

Yet this bird looked listless and weak, likely unselected. However, Luo Tian sensed a subtle arrogance from it.

“Hmph, this sparrow isn’t ordinary,” Diao Dezhu’s purple eyes glowed as he gazed at the bird.

Feeling observed, the sparrow slowly opened its eyes. Its black eyes made Luo Tian shiver.

But it only glanced at Luo Tian before turning its gaze to Diao Dezhu, surprise flickering in its black eyes before it closed them again.

“I want this tiger!” Ye Liangchen shouted, selecting his initial choice.

“Liangchen, take this sparrow!” Luo Tian urged Ye Liangchen, his tone playful. The bird was clearly no ordinary beast.

“Huh?” Seeing Luo Tian choose the sparrow, Ye Liangchen was speechless.

“Tian, are you sure? This sparrow has been here for years. Look at its body—definitely not tough!” Ye Liangchen tried to dissuade him, doubting the sparrow’s strength.

“This sparrow has been selected three times but always lost. People took it, then it returned on its own. Probably they didn’t want it!” Ye Liangchen observed the bird, trying to convince him.

“Liangchen, trust me. You won’t regret it!” Luo Tian smiled. He only wanted to warn him; the choice was Ye Liangchen’s.

“Brother, this sparrow has strong bloodline. At least as strong as me!” Long Jie’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him start.

“Fine. Since you’re Tian, I’ll trust you once. Though this sparrow is weak, my雷雪虎 (Lightning Snow Tiger) is definitely the strongest in this arena!” Ye Liangchen grinned, paying for the exchange. Two beasts cost 12 million Xian Qi Stones—10 million for the tiger, and 2 million for the sparrow, the cheapest in the arena.

“Only one more. Let’s choose carefully!” Ye Liangchen spoke again, scanning other cages.

Not long after, Ye Liangchen selected a dragon-like beast. Its appearance was fierce, with eyes glowing with power. Though it looked impressive, Luo Tian preferred a three-colored giant snake with scars—evidence of frequent battles. He noticed the snake’s scales had cracks, hinting at an evolution toward a dragon.

But Ye Liangchen didn’t choose it. Luo Tian said nothing; he felt one sparrow was enough.

They returned to the platform, sitting on luxurious seats. Ye Liangchen wore a smug expression, while Luo Tian sighed at Ye Liangchen’s extravagance—nearly 20 million Xian Qi Stones spent on three beasts.

Though the beasts were powerful and promising, 20 million was excessive.

“Ye Liangchen, did you finish so quickly?” Liu Yangwei smirked as he walked out from the beast cages, his eyes confident.

“Of course. You impotent fool! Don’t say you’re impotent—how long does it take to choose beasts? Haha!” Ye Liangchen mocked, prompting the Star River Mansion’s aristocrats to laugh.

“Ye Liangchen, did you forget how you lost last time?” Liu Yangwei gritted his teeth.

“You impotent—”

“Last time I won eight million Xian Qi Stones…”

“You impotent—”

“I broke through to the Heavenly Immortal late stage recently. You’re no longer my match…”

“You impotent—”

Ye Xing and Liu Yangwei exchanged words. Though Liu Yangwei emphasized his superiority, Ye Liangchen only replied with three words.

“Ye! Liang! Chen!” Liu Yangwei gritted his teeth, staring at Ye Liangchen. Every time he met him, despite winning many times, he was always infuriated by Ye Liangchen.

“Say it. How much do you want to bet?” Liu Yangwei took a deep breath, addressing Ye Liangchen.

“You decide. Today my esteemed Ye Liangchen will play with you!” Ye Liangchen smirked, clearly boasting his wealth.

“Good. How about twenty million Xian Qi Stones?” Liu Yangwei said harshly, causing people to gasp.

“Twenty million? Are you asking for charity? Fourty million!” Ye Liangchen shook his head, now flaunting his wealth.

“Good. Since you insist on giving me money, I’ll oblige!” Liu Yangwei sneered, recalling his preparations and growing confident.

“Little Tiger, Little Dragon, lend me ten million each! I’ll return them later!” Liu Yangwei called to the people behind him.

“Haha, such a small amount of Xian Qi Stones requires borrowing!” Ye Liangchen sneered.

“Enough. Let’s start. I have things to do. After winning, I’ll leave!” Ye Liangchen showed impatience, urging them.

“Start!” Liu Yangwei gathered the Xian Qi Stones and ordered the Battle Arena staff.

Upon hearing their commands, the staff fetched the beasts chosen by Ye Liangchen and Liu Yangwei.

Not long after, six cages were carried onto the platform. Fierce beasts radiating a fierce aura appeared before the crowd.

“Haha…” When Liu Yangwei saw the small cage holding the sparrow, he burst into laughter. His people also laughed.

“Ye Liangchen, is this the beast you chose?” Liu Yangwei nearly choked with laughter. This sparrow was infamous—few selected it, and none had ever won because it always fled upon release.

“Stop talking nonsense…” Ye Liangchen’s face turned red. Seeing the crowd and onlookers’ gazes, he felt annoyed.

“Start! Start!” Ye Liangchen urged loudly, glancing at Luo Tian. Though he was puzzled by Luo Tian’s smile, he could only grit his teeth.

“Wait, I also want to bet against Ye Xiong!” As Ye Liangchen’s words ended, a voice echoed from behind Liu Yangwei.

“I also want to bet against Ye Xiong!” The people behind Liu Yangwei immediately brightened, speaking one after another.

“This…” Ye Liangchen’s face darkened. These people clearly believed he would lose. If they all joined, even with his wealth, he couldn’t handle it.

“Liangchen, take it. If you lack Xian Qi Stones, I’ll cover them!” As Ye Liangchen hesitated, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his ear. Such a chance to profit was too good to miss.

Though Luo Tian had few Xian Qi Stones—after buying the Divine War Song, he had only two million left. The storage rings of those killed by Sun Kernen were taken by Xuan Dan, but he knew Xuan Dan had plenty.

“Good. I’ll take it. Today my Ye Liangchen will make you all bankrupt, even making you not recognize your mothers!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Ye Liangchen felt a surge of confidence. He was proud; this opportunity to boost his image couldn’t be missed.

“Haha… Ye Liangchen is truly Ye Liangchen. I bet five million Xian Qi Stones…”

“I bet eight million!” Upon hearing Ye Liangchen’s words, people immediately took out their Xian Qi Stones and handed them to the Battle Arena staff.

“Good…” Ye Liangchen counted, handing over storage bags from Luo Tian and Xuan Dan, as well as his own. A total of eighty million.

“Eighty million! This is a shocking gamble!” People’s faces showed shock, watching Ye Liangchen and Liu Yangwei’s groups. Together, their Xian Qi Stones totaled 160 million— an astonishing number.

“Start!” Liu Yangwei sneered, addressing the Battle Arena staff.

“Clatter…” The cage doors opened. Several fierce beasts stepped out, growling at their opponents. They knew this was a life-or-death battle; even if not killed, they might be slaughtered by Ye Liangchen’s group.

Chapter 1908: The Sparrow

“Roar…” A thirteen-foot-high Lightning Snow Tiger roared, its powerful aura bursting forth like a king of beasts. It charged toward the bull Liu Yangwei had chosen.

“Moo…” The bull roared, its dark body with glowing horns charging toward the tiger.

“Crack…” The silver horn pierced the tiger’s body, while the tiger’s sharp teeth bit into the bull.

“Roar…” Blood splattered; the tiger was pierced through, and the bull lost a chunk of flesh.

After one clash, both beasts were wounded. Blood and wounds only fueled their ferocity.

On the other side, two dragons clashed repeatedly. Their tails lashed at each other, teeth biting fiercely. The collision sounds echoed on the platform, blood splattered, and the crowd cheered.

A black snake coiled around the platform. Its emerald eyes glowed coldly, gazing at the sparrow that stood motionless.

The sparrow, however, ignored it. It flapped its gray wings and flew upward, avoiding battle to watch the Lightning Snow Tiger and dragons fight.

“Hiss…” The snake raised its head, coiling its body as if to strike the sparrow.

“Haha, that sparrow is about to flee again!” Liu Yangwei laughed, watching the sparrow soar.

“Black snake, it’s naturally a predator of birds. Ye Liangchen, you chose a beast that fits the black snake’s taste!” Liu Yangwei smirked, mocking Ye Liangchen.

“Hiss…” The snake’s red tongue flickered. It was enraged by the small sparrow and lunged, its long body stretching into a black lightning bolt. Its mouth opened wide, revealing cold fangs—this sparrow wasn’t even worth its teeth.

“Chirp…” The sparrow called, flapping its wings hurriedly. It seemed afraid, flying to the side.

The sparrow barely escaped as the snake’s mouth snapped where it had been.

“Boom…” The massive body of the snake landed back on the platform, making a dull sound.

“Haha, Ye Liangchen, you’ve got some moves. This sparrow evaded!” Liu Yangwei saw the sparrow escape but didn’t care; this had happened before.

“Hiss…” The snake’s red tongue flickered. It was enraged by the small sparrow and spat a black poison arrow.

The arrow’s speed surpassed the snake itself, becoming a streak of light toward the sparrow.

“Chirp…” The sparrow flapped its wings again, narrowly dodging the poison arrow.

“Plop…” The black poison liquid fell back onto the platform, corroding it into a deep pit that quickly restored itself.

Seeing the sparrow evade again, the snake was furious. How could it, a snake king, fail against such a small sparrow? This would be embarrassing if known.

The snake’s mouth opened wide, shooting waves of poison arrows like rain toward the sparrow. Liu Yangwei smiled; this time it would end. Even if the sparrow was fast, it couldn’t dodge so many arrows.

The chirping sounds echoed as the sparrow flew wildly. Its gray feathers fell a few, and it nearly got hit but evaded mysteriously.

“Clatter…” The arrows fell on the platform, corroding it continuously.

“Everyone was shocked. It all evaded!” All faces showed disbelief as the sparrow still flapped its wings high above.

“Don’t pay attention to that bird. It’s good at fleeing. Help the other two beasts, kill the Lightning Snow Tiger and dragon!” Liu Yangwei’s face darkened, shouting at the snake.

“Hiss…” The snake’s eyes showed reluctance but obeyed Liu Yangwei. Now, Liu Yangwei was its master; life and death were in his hands.

The thick snake body twisted, moving toward the battlefield of the Lightning Snow Tiger and bull.

At this moment, the Lightning Snow Tiger and bull were locked in fierce combat. Their massive bodies were bloodied; their eyes were red, attacking relentlessly.

“Hiss…” The snake’s tail swung, leaving afterimages as it struck the Lightning Snow Tiger just knocked down by the bull.

“Crack…” The clear sound of breaking echoed. The Lightning Snow Tiger, just standing up, was struck by the snake’s tail and knocked down with a loud roar.

“Boom…” The bull’s heavy steps rose, like a mountain, colliding with the Lightning Snow Tiger’s body.

“Plop…” The sharp horn pierced the Lightning Snow Tiger’s abdomen, tearing it open.

The massive tiger body was thrown back dozens of feet, landing on the platform with a dull sound. Its eyes showed weakness.

“Roar…” But the Lightning Snow Tiger still roared, spitting out a cold breath. The platform turned icy, and the cold air spread outward, blocking the bull and snake’s steps.

But everyone could see this Lightning Snow Tiger was defeated—only a matter of time.

“Damn it, you bird! Come fight me! Do you think I’ll let you escape? If I lose, I’ll pluck your feathers and cook them for soup!” Ye Liangchen shouted at the sparrow flying high, jumping in frustration.

But the sparrow ignored him. It flew high above, coldly watching everything. The black snake and bull approached the Lightning Snow Tiger, the snake’s body coiling around the weakened tiger. The bull raised its thick leg and repeatedly stomped on the tiger, each step producing a crackling sound.

“Game over…” Ye Liangchen watched the Lightning Snow Tiger turned into meat paste, blood splattered on the ground. His face was grim.

“Moo…”

“Hiss…” The bull and snake finished off the Lightning Snow Tiger, turning back to face the two dragons locked in combat.

“Sparrow, I don’t know why you’re here. But if you make me lose money, I’ll make you regret it!” Luo Tian sighed, transmitting to the sparrow.

“Kid, dare to threaten me? When I roamed the Xian World, you were probably still a liquid. Believe me, I’ll destroy you now!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind as the sparrow glanced at him, making his body tremble.

This glance was like a lightning bolt in clear skies. Luo Tian felt an immediate sense of crisis, as if facing the heavens themselves. The owner of this gaze was the master of this world.

“An immortal, definitely an immortal!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He had met the strongest people—those who stopped him, like the purple-robed elder and Star River Mansion’s master Ye Wudao. But in his view, none were as strong as this seemingly ordinary sparrow.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He hadn’t expected this sparrow to be an immortal. Originally, he wanted to subdue it, but who knew it was so powerful.

“Damn it, why are you here pretending to be weak?” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. At this point, he dared not threaten the sparrow.

“Looks like I have to use my own method!” Luo Tian looked at the dragon about to be attacked, now on the brink of death.

“Hiss…” The Beast Control Seal flew from Luo Tian’s body, four green qi streams bursting out and rushing into the beasts on the platform.

“Sorry!” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the three beasts with glowing eyes.

“Roar…” The dragon chosen by Ye Liangchen was covered in blood, scales falling to the ground.

“Haha… Ye Liangchen, it seems you’ll lose this time!” Liu Yangwei laughed wildly. This loss would cost Ye Liangchen dearly, enough to make him cry.

“Sigh…” Ye Liangchen sighed, gazing at the bloodied dragon. Though Liu Yangwei’s three beasts were injured, they were much stronger than this dragon.

“Roar…” But as Ye Liangchen felt desperate, the seemingly dying dragon let out a roar. Its body radiated green qi, and Liu Yangwei’s three beasts stood motionless.

“Crack…” In people’s eyes, the dragon roared and inhaled Xian Qi. Its power gradually rose, and its wounds rapidly healed.

“Ascension!” Everyone gasped. This was a familiar situation—ascension.

“Haha…” Ye Liangchen laughed, turning despair into joy. He hadn’t expected his chosen dragon to ascend. If it reached the Heavenly Immortal early stage, it would crush the other three beasts.

“Impossible!” Liu Yangwei stood up abruptly, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Chapter 1909: The Sparrow’s Terror

“Ascension!” Everyone’s faces showed disbelief, watching the dragon’s power rising. Finally, it reached a half-Heavenly Immortal stage—close to the early Heavenly Immortal.

“This dragon has injuries and was on its last legs. Otherwise, it would have ascended to the early Heavenly Immortal!” People gasped.

“Roar…” The half-Heavenly Immortal power burst forth. The dragon’s thick tail struck the black snake, breaking it into two pieces without resistance.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed on the platform. This Heavenly Dao stage dragon was split into two, and no resistance.

“What’s happening? Why didn’t the dragon fight back? Though a half-True Immortal is strong, this dragon has fought in the Battle Arena for years. It shouldn’t be intimidated by a half-True Immortal beast!” Everyone looked puzzled.

“Haha, stomp the black snake!” Ye Liangchen laughed. He hadn’t expected this reversal of fortune, though he didn’t know why.

“Roar…” Hearing Ye Liangchen’s words, the dragon raised its foot and stomped on the rigid black snake.

“Boom…” The massive head turned into a blood mist. Rotten blood splattered on the platform, causing people to gasp again.

“What’s happening? The black snake didn’t fight back either!” Everyone was confused, not knowing why Liu Yangwei’s beasts suddenly lost their will to fight.

“It must be my aura scaring them. Haha!” Ye Liangchen laughed, now it was clear who would win.

“Ye Liangchen, are you too early to celebrate?” Liu Yangwei’s face was dark with water droplets. He knew Ye Liangchen must have used some trick.

“Do you think you have tricks? Originally, he thought his preparations wouldn’t be needed. But who knew this mishap would happen.”

“Clap… clap… clap…” Liu Yangwei clapped his hands, the clear sound causing people to look puzzled.

“Haha… Liu Yangwei, are you crazy? Clapping for me?” Ye Liangchen laughed wildly, watching Liu Yangwei and his companions with grim faces—clearly a second-generation aristocrat.

“Roar…” Before Ye Liangchen’s words ended, another thunderous roar echoed in people’s ears.

“Hiss…” Xian Qi gathered again, flowing toward the bull. People’s faces changed again.

“Another ascension?” People were stunned. It was the first time two beasts in the Battle Arena had ascended.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian frowned. He could feel a violent force in the bull’s body fighting against the Beast Control Seal.

The bull panted heavily, its eyes red. It roared but Luo Tian could hear pain in the roar.

“Suppress!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, green light spreading from his eyes. The bull’s eyes gradually turned green again.

“Early Heavenly Immortal!” People gasped, seeing the bull’s power fixed at the early Heavenly Immortal stage. Their faces showed disbelief.

“Kill this dragon!” Liu Yangwei shouted, his voice cold.

“This battle is truly exciting! No one knew the outcome until the end!” People sighed, knowing the bull’s ascension to early Heavenly Immortal would definitely suppress the dragon.

“What’s happening? This bull hasn’t moved yet!” Next, people showed disbelief, watching the bull return to calm.

“Boom…” The green dragon’s tail struck the bull, but it only took a step back without injury.

“Boom… boom…” The dragon kept attacking, but the bull’s body was like iron—only moving without any injury.

“Can’t break through defense? Will this battle end in a draw?” People saw the bull standing still and the dragon attacking, whispering.

“Damn it! Fight back!” Liu Yangwei kept clapping and shouting, but the bull didn’t react.

Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with green light, staring at the bull and suppressing the force trying to break free from the Beast Control Seal.

“Haha, Liu Yangwei, even if you clap your hands until they’re broken, your big bull won’t listen. Who else but my Kingly Aura?” Ye Liangchen laughed, believing he would definitely win if the dragon kept attacking.

“Ye Liangchen, your stupid dragon can’t beat my bull. How will you win? When your dragon is exhausted, that’s when you lose!” Liu Yangwei sneered but his heart was drumming. He didn’t know why the bull was in this state.

At this point, neither Luo Tian nor Liu Yangwei could control the outcome. Neither Luo Tian’s Beast Control Seal nor Liu Yangwei’s tricks could decide who would win. The battle returned to fairness.

Either the dragon broke through the bull’s defense or it exhausted and died.

“I can’t leave the outcome to luck!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with light. The battle was evenly matched, but he knew there was still a variable—the sparrow!

“Child, are you planning something against me?” The sparrow’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, gazing at him.

“Master, may I ask for your help to win this bet?” Luo Tian transmitted, sensing the sparrow must have some hidden truth in the Battle Arena.

“Haha, consider it rent. Hurry up and finish; I’m bored!” The sparrow’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. Then, waves rose on the platform.

The sparrow’s chirping echoed in people’s ears, still annoying. Though they didn’t pay much attention, everyone heard it clearly.

“Hiss…” The sparrow opened its mouth, a scorching aura rising on the platform. A red lotus emerged from the sparrow’s mouth, small but radiating terror.

The red lotus was only as big as a fingernail. If not observed carefully, it would be missed. But Luo Tian felt terror from it.

The red lotus expanded gradually, making people notice its presence. At the moment the lotus appeared, the dragon attacking the bull suddenly stopped. Its eyes’ green light faded, and it trembled on the spot.

“What is this? The sparrow’s attack?” Everyone showed shock. Now, the lotus had grown to palm size, making it visible.

“Hiss…” The red lotus radiated an eerie aura. It landed on the trembling bull, like a mark.

After attaching, it disappeared from people’s sight. They looked puzzled.

“Haha… Ye Liangchen, this is your sparrow’s attack. But you’re still good—this sparrow has never attacked before, always fleeing!” Liu Yangwei mocked.

But the next moment, everyone’s mouths opened wide. Their eyes showed shock and disbelief.

In their sight, the bull’s massive body began to vanish, rapidly expanding. Within a breath, it disappeared completely, as if it had never existed.

Luo Tian’s face changed wildly. He didn’t know why, but he felt something had vanished from the bull—not life, not soul…

“This…” Everyone trembled. They hadn’t expected the sparrow to have such power.

“Haha, I won!” Ye Liangchen laughed heartlessly. He glanced at the sparrow and took the attendant’s storage bag.

The sparrow flew toward Luo Tian, disappearing into the green mark on his front in people’s sight.

“Child, don’t disturb me. I’ve paid the rent. If you bother me, I’ll kill you!” The sparrow’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“…”

Luo Tian was speechless, watching the sparrow inside the Beast Control Seal. His eye twitched. Seeing people’s greedy gazes, he felt like carrying a bomb.

At this moment, everyone knew the sparrow was a powerful beast—a super strong immortal. Just by expelling the red lotus, it could destroy a Heavenly Immortal. Such power surpassed True Immortals.

“Ye Liangchen, this time you were lucky!” Liu Yangwei’s face was grim. He gazed at Ye Liangchen, then focused on Luo Tian.

“Child, what’s your name?” Liu Yangwei asked Luo Tian, his voice cold. He now realized it must be Luo Tian’s trickery; the sparrow flew to him.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian replied softly, gazing at Liu Yangwei. This aristocrat was beneath his notice.

“Child, don’t look down on him. Don’t look at anyone!” The sparrow’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making his body tremble.
