“Several of you are overstepping! Just as those long dragons were about to strike, a cold snort echoed from the platform. Xuan Dan’s figure appeared before them.”

Xuan Dan extended his hand, grasping the golden aura. He clutched several long dragons within his palm and crushed them with a single squeeze, causing them to collapse in a burst of energy.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s expression darkened as he stood outside Dan Peak, his eyes flashing with icy intent.

Chapter 1927: The True Master Has Returned

Longmen Dan Peak
It had been a long time since anything occurred at Dan Peak, but now the area resounded with thunderous roars. The platform meant for the Dan Competition had transformed into a combat arena.

A robust figure slammed a peak disciple onto the ground below.
“Who else?!” A deep voice echoed as a hulking figure stood on the platform, his eyes blazing with ferocity. His presence radiated an overwhelming pressure, far surpassing normal strength. Even more intimidating was the aura of a Late Xian.

“This is the eighth one!” The crowd murmured, their gazes turning to the figure standing there.

Xuan Dan had taken over Luo Tian’s challenge, drawing all attention to Dan Peak, which naturally became the center of the trials.

“Such power! A Late Xian… How come I’ve never heard of Luo Tian’s brother before? Only the Dragon Ranking could match him!”

“Unfortunately, Cen Xiong has already ascended to a Late Xian. Ruanying He, Zhu Fenghuo Zhao Ri… they have all perished. If they were alive, they could’ve challenged him!” The crowd whispered.

Within half a time, the hulking figure had defeated eight opponents—each of whom was renowned within Longmen. Among them were those ranked fifth to tenth on the Dragon Ranking, yet none could withstand his might for more than a moment before being hurled away.

“I feel Luo Tian’s brother is even stronger than Luo Tian himself!” The crowd had never witnessed Luo Tian’s true strength. They knew he had once felled Zhao Ri with a single strike, but they’d never seen him face Ruanying He or Zhu Fenghuo. The title of the peak had been passed from Cen Weihong to Luo Tian, but no one questioned it.

“You dare be so arrogant?!” A senior elder descended from the sky, his face dark with fury.

The crowd gasped, their eyes turning to the elder.
“Feng Peak’s Master stands!” The disciples exclaimed in unison. Everyone knew the next Grandmaster would be chosen among the eight elders, but Luo Tian’s interference had angered them.

“Hmph! A mere old man?” The hulking figure glared at Feng Peak’s Master, dismissing him entirely.

“He should be able to handle it. Though this man is strong, he’s still an elder. A Late Xian elder should be stronger than him!” The disciples murmured.

“Die, you insolent brat! Since Luo Tian arrived, Longmen has never known peace. First, I’ll kill you, then I’ll kill Luo Tian!” Feng Peak’s Master sneered, his form flickering as he lunged forward.

“Kill me? You dare kill my brother? I’ll tear you apart!” Luo Tian’s face reddened as he charged forward.

The hulking figure, like a mountain, trembled with each step, shaking the platform.
“Fearsome flesh!” Feng Peak’s Master dodged mid-air, evading the brute’s attack. He leapt into the air, his hands forming seals as a golden mountain descended upon Luo Tian.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian raised his hands, unyielding.
With a roar, he caught the mountain in his grip and swung it down with a single punch. The golden mountain shattered into fragments.

A thunderous explosion echoed as Luo Tian’s fist collided with Feng Peak’s Master, hurling him backward.

“Damn it!” Feng Peak’s Master’s face paled as he felt his ribs crack under the impact.

“Die!” Luo Tian roared, his hands moving like a storm as he lunged forward.

“Stop!” The crowd shouted, but this time they allowed the fight to continue. After all, Longmen had suffered heavy losses, and even the elders agreed that eliminating a few would be justified.

A few golden dragons surged toward Luo Tian, halting his advance.
“Several elders intend to exterminate him!” The crowd gasped.

“Several of you are overstepping! Just as those long dragons were about to strike, a cold snort echoed from the platform. Xuan Dan’s figure appeared before them.”

Xuan Dan grasped the golden aura, crushing several dragons with a single squeeze.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s expression darkened as he stood outside Dan Peak, his eyes flashing with icy intent.

Chapter 1928: Sandstorm

“Continue,” Xuan Dan sneered, his gaze sweeping over three senior elders. One glance from him sent them reeling in shock.
The pressure was immense, and the three elders’ minds trembled. They stood motionless, their gazes shifting toward Xuan Dan. Li Changfeng’s face also shifted slightly.

Xuan Dan had ascended to the True Xian stage. Xue Changshan and Li Changfeng’s faces paled—unaware that Xuan Dan had advanced to True Xian.

“No, it’s not wrong. The pressure we feel confirms he’s in the True Xian stage,” the three elders thought to themselves.

“I didn’t expect Xuan Dan to progress so quickly,” Xue Changshan muttered, his voice low. Li Changfeng’s eyes held a complex expression.

“If you continue like this, I’ll have no choice but to act,” Xuan Dan coldly warned, his voice laced with frost.

As Xuan Dan’s words echoed, the crowd near the platform erupted in chaos. They noticed a figure standing there with an icy aura.

“Hah! Brother, I’ve returned!” A voice rang out as a figure strode forward.
“Cold Face,” the figure’s expression softened, patting Luo Tian’s broad shoulder gently.

“I just arrived and saw you about to crush Ning Liqun. Perhaps this was a blessing, allowing your strength to surge.”
“Haha! I didn’t expect you back so soon!” Diaodezhu leaped onto Luo Tian’s shoulder.
“Diaodezhu, you’re still here? I see your eyes are full of joy,” Diaodezhu greeted with a grin.
“Still? You big brute, your shoulder is comfortable! Your cultivation has reached Late Xian, while I’m only in the Early Xian. When will I reach that form? Staying with you is so frustrating!” Diaodezhu’s voice carried a hint of irritation.

“Look at that young man,” one disciple murmured, his gaze filled with admiration.
“To challenge me, you must first pass my test,” Xue Changshan said coldly, his aura intensifying.
“Step back. Since I’ve returned, I’ll handle this,” Luo Tian said softly, his gaze locking onto Xue Changshan. His eyes held a killing intent—Xue Changshan had been the one to attack the three elders earlier.

“Brother, I’ll leave this to you. My eyes need some recovery,” Luo Tian said, returning Diaodezhu to his shoulder before stepping onto the platform. His gaze swept over Shen Guozhi, then glanced at Zuo Qiuming.

“Who dares?” Luo Tian’s voice rang out, loud enough to echo through the ears of all Longmen disciples.

“Is the true master truly stronger than his brother?” The crowd’s faces bore confusion.
“He’s even stronger. I remember when he once felled Zhao Ri with a single strike. After that, we all agreed he was the top contender.”
“As for the incident where he nearly destroyed Longmen, it’s been spread throughout the three realms. People believe it was done by the strength of Star River Prefecture.”
“I see,” Shen Guozhi’s face curled into a smile. He hadn’t expected the winner to be him. His strength must have been as he thought.
“I didn’t expect your growth speed to be so terrifying,” Shen Guozhi stood on the platform.
“…You’re still standing there without any intention to attack? You don’t even regard Shen Guozhi as a threat.”
“Hmph!” Shen Guozhi’s expression shifted. His aura surged, radiating a powerful pressure.
“Late Xian,” the crowd gasped as Shen Guozhi’s cultivation burst forth.
“He’s hiding his strength well,” Zuo Qiuming muttered, now at Late Xian and nearing the half-True Xian stage.
“How can this fight proceed? A Late Xian against an Early Xian is a碾压,” the crowd murmured, assuming the outcome was already decided.
“Hmph!” As they marveled, Shen Guozhi’s aura surged violently.
“A Late Xian in the Extreme Stage against a Late Xian?” Li Changfeng and other senior elders’ brows twitched as they watched Luo Tian charge toward Shen Guozhi.

“Continue,” Xuan Dan sneered, his gaze sweeping over three senior elders. One glance from him sent them reeling in shock.

“A Late Xian in the Extreme Stage against a Late Xian?” Li Changfeng and other senior elders’ brows twitched as they watched Luo Tian charge toward Shen Guozhi.

Chapter 1929: False Accusations

As the crowd murmured, Luo Tian and Shen Guozhi clashed. Luo Tian’s aura was radiant, golden-black Xian Dan cracks spewing forth Xian energy that filled his body. His aura surged, and golden seals glowed on his right arm as he slammed it toward Shen Guozhi.

“Die!” Shen Guozhi roared, his aura towering as he struck Luo Tian with a palm.

“Crack!” The next moment, thunderous collisions echoed as the two stood frozen in place. The sky seemed to tremble under their clash.

“Step… step… step…” Luo Tian took three steps back, leaving footprints beneath him.

Meanwhile, Shen Guozhi was hurled backward, his eyes wide with disbelief. His entire arm had lost sensation.

“Gasps!” The crowd’s faces turned to shock. No one expected Luo Tian, with his Late Xian cultivation, to repel Shen Guozhi, a Late Xian peak.

“Boom!” A deep sound rose from Luo Tian’s feet as he moved like lightning, charging toward Shen Guozhi again.

Shen Guozhi cursed, trying to dodge, but Luo Tian’s fists came like a storm, pounding him relentlessly.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed as Luo Tian and Shen Guozhi clashed, with Shen Guozhi constantly retreating.

“Is this truly Luo Tian’s true strength?”
“He has subdued Shen Elder! Shen Elder is a Late Xian peak!” The Longmen disciples were stunned.

“This brat has truly taken root! Such rapid progress in such a short time!” Xue Changshan muttered, standing there.

Other senior elders were also stunned, their gazes on Luo Tian. When he had defeated the two Longmen elites in the chaos of the Ruin Gate, his talent had already shone. Yet none could have imagined he would surpass their disciples so swiftly.

“Hmph!” Shen Guozhi roared, feeling the unbearable pressure from Luo Tian’s restraint. He wanted to vomit blood but found no chance, each punch sending him back, his body shaking.

“Hmph! Incredibly resilient for a Late Xian peak!” Luo Tian attacked while speaking, making Shen Guozhi want to vomit blood.

“Brat! Use your martial techniques!” Shen Guozhi shouted, but Luo Tian ignored him, raining punches that forced Shen Guozhi to the edge of the platform’s barrier.

“Boom!” Shen Guozhi’s body collided with the barrier, spitting blood and turning pale.

“Martial techniques! Use them!” Luo Tian sneered, his hands forming seals—One was the “Heaven-Grabbing Seal,” the other the “Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map.” With a thunderous roar, he unleashed a powerful pressure toward Shen Guozhi as he stood up.

“Boom… boom…” Two formidable martial techniques struck Shen Guozhi, who had just risen and felt his bones about to shatter.

Dust obscured the view, leaving the Dan Peak silent as Luo Tian stood proudly on the platform.

“From the start, Elder Shen never had a chance. Not even a single counterattack!” Everyone’s faces were filled with shock, stunned by Luo Tian’s strength beyond their expectations.

“Foolish piece of trash!” Xue Changshan muttered internally, yet he was also amazed by Luo Tian’s combat power. He had expected a fierce battle but never imagined Luo Tian would completely subdue Shen Guozhi.

“Hmph!” Shen Guozhi roared, standing up but trembling like a leaf, his eyes blood-red as he glared at Luo Tian.

“I’ll kill you!” Shen Guozhi had lost his mind, the most humiliating defeat he’d faced since joining Longmen. Even when confronting Ke Zhenghao and Zuo Qiuming, he hadn’t been so desperate.

“Hmph!” A wild gust of energy surged from Shen Guozhi, his body emitting a series of crackling sounds.

“Tianlong Wuxiang! Bless my divine power!” Shen Guozhi roared, golden Xian energy radiating from him, forming a dragon-shaped phantom that enveloped him.

“Tianlong Wuxiang!” The crowd shouted in recognition.
Tianlong Wuxiang was a secret technique of Longmen, reserved for only the most elite disciples. Only a few among the senior elders and their direct disciples could master it.

“Hmph!” Shen Guozhi roared, his dragon-shaped phantom charging toward Luo Tian.

Golden dragons radiated with golden light, and more terrifyingly, void cracks formed around them—though small, they confirmed Shen Guozhi’s attack was on par with a True Xian.

“Fayiang Tian Di!” Luo Tian suddenly turned, his body expanding to a hundred feet as he faced the roaring dragon.

“If you wish to kill me, I’ll grant your wish!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, his voice carrying an odd tone. Ancient incantations appeared on him, their invisible waves spreading across Dan Peak.

“Hmph! My blood is boiling!” A group of Longmen disciples shouted, their faces turning red as their cultivation naturally rose.

“Hmph!” A massive figure suddenly stood up, roaring into the sky with blood-curdling energy. This was Chen Zhanbiao.

“Hmph!” Everyone’s eyes widened in disbelief at the towering figure.

“Are they really brothers?” The crowd wondered, staring at the two giants.

“Will we be crushed?” After seeing Chen Zhanbiao’s towering form, people felt a sense of dread.

“Man Shen Qi Tu! Shatter the Ancient!” Luo Tian coldly spoke, his voice echoing through heaven and earth. A pale-faced phantom appeared behind him, merging with his form.

“Hmph!” The massive foot, covered in ancient script, slowly lifted and stomped toward the golden dragon.

“Hmph!” The next moment, the golden foot landed on the golden dragon, sending a thunderous explosion across the platform.

The golden dragon shattered, obscuring the view.
“Crack… crack…” A deafening explosion echoed in their ears, and the massive platform trembled violently.

“How is it?” Everyone’s faces turned pale as they stared at the platform, waiting for the intense Xian energy to dissipate.

“One… two…”
Three seconds passed, and a powerful suction force spread across the platform, instantly absorbing the chaotic Xian energy. People saw the scene on the platform:
A towering figure stood there, a crack spreading beneath his feet. The suction force came from those cracks.
A pool of blood lay nearby, and Shen Guozhi’s figure was nowhere to be found.

“Elder Shen is dead!” The crowd gasped, stunned that Luo Tian had dared to kill a senior elder in front of so many.

The platform’s cracks slowly healed as Luo Tian stood there, his gaze sweeping over the crowd.
“Who dares? No one?” Luo Tian spoke slowly, his voice echoing across Dan Peak.

The crowd fell into a deathly silence.
Then everyone turned their gaze to Zuo Qiuming, the last remaining elder among the four. The other three were dead or injured.
Luo Tian’s gaze also fell on Zuo Qiuming, his expression complex. He had originally intended for Zuo Qiuming to become the Grandmaster of Longmen, but Xue Changshan’s lingering doubts and his knowledge of Zang Yunfei’s intentions complicated things.

“Brat! You’ve slain my Longmen elders, defying hierarchy. Do you not know your guilt?” One senior elder sneered coldly, his gaze icy toward Luo Tian.

“You wanted to kill me first. Why should I die?”
“My brother was nearly killed too. Why didn’t you intervene then?” Luo Tian coldly replied, ignoring the elder entirely.

Xuan Dan had already entered the True Xian stage. Even Zang Yunfei, the Mountain-Subduing Elder, wouldn’t allow himself to be killed. After all, he still had the Xuan Tian Island and Star River Prefecture as his allies.

“You! Brat! What are you? Daring to defy me? I was already a senior when you were still nowhere!” The elder scolded, but he didn’t act.

“Grandmaster, this brat is ruthless! He killed a sect elder. I suggest executing him!” Another senior elder addressed Li Changfeng, who had remained silent.

“Combat is natural; deaths are inevitable. Why spread lies?” Xuan Dan sneered, reappearing beside Luo Tian as he returned to normal size.

“Killing Shen Guozhi was part of the combat, but what about Du Chengshi, Zhang Jinghuan, Ke Zhenghao, Duan Chengfeng…? Why did they die? Only you and this brat survived. Don’t you have an explanation?” Xue Changshan finally spoke, his gaze on Xuan Dan.

“Foolish Xue! Don’t spread lies. I explained when I returned—they attacked me, so I fought back! Weihong was taken in by Star River Prefecture!” Xuan Dan’s brow twitched.

“Old Xue, I believe you, but I don’t think this brat could’ve survived Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi’s attacks. If I’m not mistaken, he was only in the Early Xian stage then,” Xue Changshan’s gaze returned to Luo Tian.

Chapter 1930: Enemies Arrive

Hearing Xue Changshan’s words, the crowd turned their eyes to Luo Tian. Xuan Dan’s face also darkened slightly.

“Father-in-law!” Zuo Qiuming’s expression shifted, his gaze on Xue Changshan. He wondered why Xue had targeted Luo Tian so fiercely.

“Elder, what do you mean? Please clarify,” Luo Tian smiled slightly, his gaze on Xue Changshan. He showed no signs of panic.

“Silence!” Xue Changshan scolded Zuo Qiuming, who was about to speak. He regretted not eliminating Luo Tian earlier. He had always feared Zuo Qiuming couldn’t control him, and now Luo Tian proved his fears.

“You rely on underhanded methods, colluding with Star River Prefecture and Xuan Tian Island to kill my Longmen elders!” Xue Changshan roared, his voice like thunder, shaking everyone’s minds.

“Indeed! I agree with you. It shouldn’t be far off!” Hearing Xue Changshan’s words, the other three senior elders’ eyes also brightened, echoing his statement.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and two crystalline spheres flew from it, exploding with a thunderous roar.

A sequence of images appeared before the crowd: one in Xuan Tian Island, showing Tiantian Yun and Xiao Jiaping falsely accusing Luo Tian.
The other showed Zhang Jinghuan, Du Chengshi, and Ke Zhenghao attacking Luo Tian and Xuan Dan.

“My heavens! Luo Tian could’ve killed Ke Elder!” But after seeing the battle scene, Longmen disciples and elders’ faces changed. They gazed at Luo Tian with reverence as he unleashed various techniques against Ke Zhenghao.

“Only part of his strength was used in the fight! What if he fought with all his might?” The crowd’s eyes widened, staring at Luo Tian in awe.

After a while, the images stopped. Luo Tian smiled, his gaze on Xue Changshan and others’ pale faces.

“Elder, have you seen the truth? I did nothing at first—they wanted to kill me. Shouldn’t I have fought back?” Luo Tian feigned innocence.

“Brat, how do you explain the incident at the Outer Sect’s Mountain Tomb?” Xue Changshan sneered, causing Luo Tian to pause slightly.

Luo Tian was confused. He had been cultivating the Ghost-Controlling Seal at the Mountain Tomb, which shouldn’t be a problem. He didn’t know what Xue Changshan meant by this.

“Wait… those six people!” Luo Tian suddenly recalled. He had bound six individuals at the Mountain Tomb but forgotten about them afterward.

“Did those six die?”
“If Longmen’s rules apply, killing fellow disciples without cause is a capital offense!” Luo Tian thought to himself. Besides this incident, he couldn’t think of anything else.

“Hmph!” Xue Changshan sneered, raising his hand. A figure appeared before the crowd.

“When I arrived, five had died in the Mountain Tomb, but only he remained alive—though he was already mad!” Xue Changshan spoke softly, his gaze on the youth standing there, eyes vacant. He was one of the six bound at the Mountain Tomb.

“Don’t kill me! Don’t eat me! Grandpa Luo, let me go! I know I’m wrong!” The youth screamed at the crowd, his face filled with terror.

“This…,” The crowd’s faces changed as they gazed at Luo Tian, their eyes filled with intense disapproval.

“Binding people in the Mountain Tomb—what great enmity!”
