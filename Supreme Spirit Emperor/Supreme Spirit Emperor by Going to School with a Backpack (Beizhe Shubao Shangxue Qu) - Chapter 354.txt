The entire Thunder Sea Marsh seemed to have lost a tenth of its essence, converging into Li Tianzhi's grasp. The overwhelming pressure caused Luotian and his companions to pale in shock.

"Damn, your nine realms' human race is so powerful!" Fu Xingyue's handsome face bore disbelief as he gazed at the thunderous blade hovering above Li Tianzhi, his eyes wide with astonishment.

"Ancestral Royal Clan!" Sun Kedian and Diao Dezhu's group, sensing an otherworldly aura on Fu Xingyue, narrowed their eyes with cold glares.

The Ancestral Royal Clan despised humanity, yet humanity harbored equal hatred. Upon seeing the Ancestral Royal Clan, they loathed Fu Xingyue even more.

"Don't be alarmed; he's my friend!" Luotian, sensing their hostility, addressed Sun Kedian.

"Let's settle this first before catching up!" Fu Xingyue waved his hands, a radiant moon rising in his palm as he hurled it toward Li Tianzhi.

"Go!" Li Tianzhi sneered, pointing his finger. A colossal phantom emerged behind him, radiating righteous energy as it grasped the thousand-zhang thunder blade and slashed toward Fu Xingyue's technique.

"Boom..." The pristine moon shattered instantly beneath the thunder blade's might, vanishing from Luotian's sight.

"Can't withstand it!" Luotian's group shuddered. Li Tianzhi's power was overwhelming; even Luotian, having taken the sixth step of the Ferocious Seven Steps, couldn't resist. Only the seventh step could help, but he hadn't mastered it yet.

"What's happening? I haven't even descended into the nine realms, and already I'm about to die here! This is truly unjust!" Fu Xingyue bellowed.

"Stop your noise!" Luotian's eyes flashed madness, his gaze locking onto Li Tianzhi. His Reincarnation Immortal Body surged with power.

"Ha! Ancestral Royal Clan, without my aid, could you enter the nine realms? That seal was opened by me. You don't even thank me, yet you attack!" Li Tianzhi sneered at Fu Xingyue.

"You actually let the Ancestral Royal Clan into the nine realms!" Luotian's group darkened at Li Tianzhi's words.

"Forgive me, Tianzhi!" Luotian sighed deeply, gazing at Li Tianzhi with a glint of cruelty.

"You wanted the cultivation from the Nether Region, I'll give it to you!" Luotian finally unleashed his killing intent. His Reincarnation Immortal Body exploded, releasing a surge of epoch power that spilled from his body.

"Buzz..." The power from the Reincarnation Immortal Body was immense, yet Li Tianzhi still sneered.

"Just this?" Li Tianzhi pointed his finger. The thunder blade descended upon Luotian's group.

"Of course not!" Luotian smiled, as the Reincarnation Immortal Body's destruction released a single strand of divine qi into the epoch power.

An overwhelming aura surged forth, sending Fu Xingyue's group into shock.

"What kind of power is this!" Fu Xingyue gaped, his eyes wide at the divine qi's formidable fluctuations. Though just a strand, it felt like an annihilating force, leaving no will to resist.

"This power doesn't belong to the nine realms or the Origin Realm. It belongs to... divinity!" Luotian pointed, his divine authority sweeping as the strand of opportunity soared toward Li Tianzhi's thunder blade.

The disparity in size was absurd. The collision erupted with a deafening roar, and Li Tianzhi's thunder blade shattered instantly, scattering into waves of lightning.

The power swept across, the strand of opportunity striking Li Tianzhi's front. His face darkened instantly.

"This..." Li Tianzhi had a deep connection with the Thunder Lord. He'd encountered forbidden power before. Such might could only be countered by the true Thunder Lord, but he wasn't that. He was merely a fragment of the Thunder Lord's will, fused with Li Tianzhi and taking dominance.

"Spurt..." Blood splattered. Before he could activate the Thunder Wheel, Li Tianzhi was severed at the waist.

After decapitating Li Tianzhi, the strand of opportunity didn't vanish. It soared toward the depths of the Thunder Sea Marsh, sweeping across millions of miles until it reached the junction between Star Moon Clan and the Thunder Sea Marsh.

"What is this thing!" At that moment, three elders of Star Moon Clan sat in meditation, observing the Thunder Sea Marsh awaiting Fu Xingyue's return. Unexpectedly, they encountered this strand of power.

"Stop it!" The three epoch peak elders exchanged glances, then raised their hands. A series of barriers formed before them.

"Crack..." The barriers shattered instantly, the strand striking their bodies and leaving them pale.

"At least there's time to prepare. This power seems weakened," Fu Wenbin sighed, his eyes wide with fear.

"Let's wait a bit. I didn't expect the nine realms to be this strong now," the three elders exchanged glances, resuming their meditation.

"It's over!" Luotian and his group sighed deeply. They were awed by the power but also felt sorrow.

Li Tianzhi's severed body gradually lost vitality, showing no signs of healing. It was clearly on the brink of death.

"Can we still save him?" Luotian murmured, dashing toward Li Tianzhi's severed body. He couldn't bear to see Li Tianzhi die in his hands, even if he was fused with the Thunder Lord's will.

Chapter 1425: Saving Life

The two halves of Li Tianzhi's body rapidly lost vitality, causing Luotian's group to panic.

"Seal the Soul!" Luotian grabbed his hands, sending out invisible waves. A body could be reforged, but if the soul was gone, it would be truly dead.

Numerous gray vapors were extracted from Li Tianzhi's body, but his soul was also rapidly vanishing. Luotian furrowed his brows.

"Is there still hope?" Diao Dezhu's group looked at Luotian with anxiety. They knew Luotian had special methods for souls. If he couldn't save him, there would be no hope.

Luotian stared intently at the weakening soul. He pointed his finger, releasing a drop of golden blood from his fingertip into the gray soul. Then he waved his hands, forming seals.

"Seal!" The blood from the Reincarnation Body slowed the soul's consumption, but it still continued.

"Is that not enough?" Luotian frowned, then waved his hand again. A streak of purple lightning shot from his palm, followed by a violet leaf carrying immense vitality.

The Purple Apex Divine Lotus's leaf. Luotian had taken two of them from the Seven Star Island when leaving the Celestial Origin Continent. They were priceless, meant to prevent incurable injuries. Now he used them to heal Li Tianzhi.

The rich vitality combined with the Reincarnation Body's blood surged into Li Tianzhi's soul, countering the annihilating force. Both the Reincarnation Body's blood and Purple Apex Divine Lotus leaf were miraculous, their combined power finally subduing the force. Luotian sighed deeply. If this didn't save him, he truly had no other options.

"Hey, kid, I knew you'd save him!" The gray, intangible soul凝聚 in Luotian's hand. His face flashed with killing intent again.

"What should we do?" Seeing the soul wasn't truly Li Tianzhi, Diao Dezhu's group looked grim. If they saved him, he'd inevitably become their enemy again. If they killed him, Li Tianzhi would be truly dead.

"Being a soul makes it easier!" Luotian's eyes showed coldness. He pointed his finger, and Li Tianzhi's soul had no resistance.

"Extract!" Luotian spoke. Invisible waves surged into Li Tianzhi's soul, causing his gray eyes to tremble with fear.

"Seal Soul Master! You're dead!" A terrified voice echoed in their ears, bringing a hint of joy to Diao Dezhu's group.

Luotian stared intently at Li Tianzhi's soul. The soul was fully exposed under his gaze, leaving no secrets hidden from Luotian's perception.

"Come out!" Luotian sneered, pointing his finger. A crimson light shot from Li Tianzhi's soul into Luotian's hand.

"Roar..." A deep growl echoed from Luotian's palm, fierce and violent. It resonated in their minds.

"Shriek..." Seven-colored flames erupted from Luotian's palm, instantly incinerating the crimson light into wisps of smoke.

"Again!" Luotian continuously grabbed, extracting streaks of crimson light from Li Tianzhi's soul. Each was destroyed by the seven-colored flames.

After an hour, sweat dripped from Luotian's forehead. His face was pale but carried a smile as he declared, "Done!"

Luotian sighed deeply, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He no longer felt the violent aura in Li Tianzhi's soul.

"Li Tianzhi, wake up!" Luotian shouted, pointing his finger at Li Tianzhi's soul.

A deep voice rose in the thunderous sea, like a master commanding. It awakened Li Tianzhi's soul, causing his floating gray form to tremble violently.

"I..." The gray soul slowly opened its eyes, confusion in them. Then it saw Luotian, Diao Dezhu, and Ren Hongzhe.

"Second Brother! Is it you!" Ren Hongzhe's eyes brimmed with excitement, watching Li Tianzhi open his eyes. He asked in a trembling voice.

"How did I become like this!" Li Tianzhi's voice carried confusion. Then his eyes gradually cleared.

"Ah..." As if recalling a painful memory, Li Tianzhi's soul howled in agony, its voice filled with anguish.

"What have I done!" Li Tianzhi looked at his gray hands, his voice filled with deep regret. He had fully remembered the Thunder Lord's will's actions.

"Second Brother!" Ren Hongzhe's voice choked, as he was the one who could most understand Li Tianzhi's feelings. Killing so many brothers with his own hands was cruel.

"Luotian, kill me! I'm sorry for everyone!" Li Tianzhi howled before gazing at Luotian, his voice filled with entreaty.

"Rubbish!" Luotian sneered at Li Tianzhi's words, his cold voice a divine command that shook Li Tianzhi.

"I worked so hard to save you, yet you're still begging for death?" Luotian's voice carried disdain as he looked at Li Tianzhi.

"You damned fool, live! Your life isn't yours anymore. We went through so much to save you. You don't know how hard it was! The past isn't your fault. To prevent such things, you must grow stronger and don't let us look down on you!" Luotian's voice was cold, his gaze fixed on Li Tianzhi.

"Yes, Second Brother. We don't blame you. If our brothers were alive, they wouldn't either. It wasn't your will. Now we've avenged our brothers!" Ren Hongzhe also spoke to console.

"Ah!" Li Tianzhi stood motionless, gazing at Luotian's pale group. He nodded heavily and bowed to them.

"Wait, we'll forge you a body soon. Then you can continue cultivating. For now, rest and fully recover your soul!" Luotian spoke, knowing Li Tianzhi had to overcome his inner turmoil alone.

"Luotian, why are you here?" Fu Xingyue finally spoke after their conversation, drawing everyone's attention to him.

"I came here to find someone. How did you end up here? Did the Star Moon Clan's seal break?" Luotian sighed, gazing at the divine and demonic map in the sky and recalling the Thunder Lord's will.

"Indeed. I don't know what happened before, but that seal weakened significantly, and the thunder power also dropped. So our clan tried to break it. We succeeded, and I even gained the map's approval!" Fu Xingyue smiled, storing the divine and demonic map.

"Then you're going to attack humanity?" Luotian sighed, gazing at Fu Xingyue with inquiry. If the Star Moon Clan attacked humanity, he didn't know how to handle it.

"Maybe. It's still under discussion. This seal's opening is known only to us Star Moon Clan, but over time, other clans will know. Then even if we're strong, we can't protect this seal. Other clans will definitely enter the nine realms through here. That's when humanity's true crisis begins," Fu Xingyue didn't hide the truth, telling Luotian directly.

"Still, you can rest easy. The Grand Elder once said I'm the commander of Star Moon Guard. So things won't change. At least, our Star Moon Clan won't attack your continent or star domain!" Fu Xingyue spoke, revealing the Star Moon Clan's limit. Now he held a high position in the clan and had some say.

"As for other forces, we'll see if they cooperate or not!" Fu Xingyue's eyes flashed cold. Though he had no hostility toward Luotian, it didn't mean he held no grudge against all humans.

Seeing Fu Xingyue's cold gaze, Luotian sighed deeply. He knew the Star Moon Clan doing nothing to attack the Four Sacred Star Domains was already a miracle.

"Thank you. What's your plan next? Return to the Star Moon Clan or stay in the nine realms for a while?" Luotian asked.

"I'll go to the nine realms. It's better to get a grasp of its situation first!" Fu Xingyue spoke softly, his voice filled with excitement.

"Ah, be careful. Humanity's hatred toward the Ancestral Clans is fierce. If all star domains' forces unite, they're not someone like you can withstand. If you truly have nowhere to run, escape to the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Luotian didn't want others to know his relationship with the Star Moon Clan but also didn't want Fu Xingyue to risk his life.

"Relax. I don't believe all nine realms' people are as strong as you. If they were, the Star Moon Clan would have no choice but to retreat into the Origin Realm!" Fu Xingyue laughed, his eyes filled with fierce battle spirit. He wanted to test the nine realms' prodigies.

"My..." As they spoke, a series of quarrels echoed in Luotian's ears. He furrowed his brows.

But soon, he felt exasperated. Sun Kedian, Diao Dezhu, and Wan Lingkong stood before the Thunder Wheel, constantly trying to take it. They fought over it endlessly.

"Damn it, Sun Kedian! You already have the Yang Fish. What else do you want!" Diao Dezhu cursed, kicking Sun Kedian's butt and sending him flying. He grabbed the Thunder Wheel and tried to refine it.

"Damn, you kicked me! If not for me, would we be here now? This should belong to me!" Sun Kedian was unhappy. He rushed forward, kicking Diao Dezhu with his leg.

"Only the worthy should possess epoch treasures. Neither of you deserves it!" Wan Lingkong also arrived, and the three fought over the Thunder Wheel.

"Hey, it's my Second Brother's. None of you can touch it!" Ren Hongzhe smiled, gradually recovering from his guilt and returning to his usual boldness. He joined the fight.

"Embarrassing!" Luotian's first thought was embarrassment, then he looked at Fu Xingyue with a burning gaze.

Epoch treasures were equivalent to the kings' weapons of clans. Who wouldn't be tempted? Even Fu Xingyue couldn't resist, joining the fight.

"..."

Luotian felt exasperated watching them fight endlessly. He turned his gaze to Li Tianzhi floating there.

"Rest well. Have you seen Qianxue and the others?" Luotian asked, though he didn't want to remind Li Tianzhi of it. He was still worried about the four women's safety.

Though they hadn't reached the Thunder Sea Marsh's depths, Li Tianzhi had definitely met them before.

"Yes. But when I tried to catch them, they escaped using a special method!" Li Tianzhi's face bore bitterness as he shook his head.

"Escaped?" Luotian sighed deeply, relieved. If the four women had been caught by Li Tianzhi at that time, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"Did you know where they went?" Luotian asked again, his voice filled with concern.

"There's an altar. It's a one-time teleportation array. If I'm not mistaken, it should have sent them to the Chaos Domain!" Li Tianzhi clearly understood the Thunder Sea Marsh. The Thunder Lord's will had merged with him, not just a simple fusion but also granting Li Tianzhi access to the Thunder Lord's memories.

That meant Li Tianzhi now had the Thunder Lord's will memories. If he recovered, he could use all the methods the Thunder Lord's will had employed.

"Chaos Domain!" Luotian's brows furrowed. He didn't have a good opinion of the Chaos Domain, having clashed with it before.

But he had no choice but to go there. Even if the chances were slim, he wouldn't give up.

"Stop fighting! We should leave!" Luotian shouted at the quarreling group. He knew the Thunder Wheel belonged to Li Tianzhi. These people who wanted to take it were pointless.

Li Tianzhi nodded, his gray soul drifting out and entering the Thunder Wheel, vanishing from their sight.

"Buzz..." The Thunder Wheel emitted a deep hum. It flew to Luotian's front.

"This is ridiculous! We worked so hard, and we didn't even get a hair!" Sun Kedian's eyes showed dissatisfaction.

"Then give me that divine qi!" Diao Dezhu smiled, addressing Sun Kedian. He thought of the power after Luotian released that strand.

"Go to hell!" Sun Kedian rubbed his sore butt, shouting back. But his eyes also showed excitement at the thought of using that power to dominate all enemies.

"Let's part ways!" Fu Xingyue bowed to Luotian. He knew his identity was sensitive in the nine realms. If people discovered their relationship, it might bring trouble.

"Ah, be careful! When you encounter the Nether Region, avoid it!" Luotian spoke softly, his voice filled with concern. He watched Fu Xingyue fly out of the Thunder Sea.

"Haha, relax! Who am I? The nine realms tremble. Fu Xingyue has arrived!" Fu Xingyue laughed, disappearing from Luotian's group.

"Show-off!"

"Arrogant!" Diao Dezhu's group looked at Fu Xingyue leaving with disdain. Then they turned to Luotian.

"Where should we go next?" Sun Kedian's group asked. They knew the Thunder Sea Marsh journey might end here. Now they had reached its depths, faced many dangers. Continuing deeper meant unknown threats.

"Chaos Domain!" Luotian sighed softly, his gaze deep. He looked toward the Thunder Sea's depths. He knew soon after, the Ancestral Clans would enter the nine realms through this seal.

"Strength isn't enough. Try to improve it!" Luotian muttered, sitting in meditation within the thunderstorms to recover.

"Chaos Domain?" Diao Dezhu's group also showed excitement, sitting in meditation to recover.

After three days of recovery, they stood up and flew out of the Thunder Sea Marsh.

"Who knows if those kids are calm?" Luotian smiled, guiding them past the Nether Region toward the array where they had imprisoned Luo Li.

Not long after, traversing the Thunder Sea Marsh for days, Luotian's group returned to where they had imprisoned Luo Li. But they found the four missing from the array, which was damaged. It wasn't clear if someone had attacked it or if they had broken through.

"What's going on!" Luotian's face darkened, looking at the destroyed array. His heart skipped a beat.

"Don't panic. Ask someone!" Diao Dezhu's group was also anxious, scanning the surroundings before grabbing a middle-aged man in the Thunder Sea Marsh who was refining his body.

"Speak! Where are those young people!" Luotian's voice was cold, his pressure descending on the middle-aged man.

Luotian was truly desperate. If not for a sliver of reason, he would have searched the man's soul. If something happened to the kids, he'd go mad.

The middle-aged man was in the late stage of Sainthood. He couldn't withstand Luotian's pressure or Diao Dezhu's hostile gaze, feeling his spine chill.

"I..." The man tried to speak but couldn't open his mouth under Luotian's immense pressure.

"Don't resist!" Luotian spoke coldly, pointing his finger. His powerful spiritual awareness surged into the man's mind, searching through his memories.

After reviewing the man's spiritual awareness, Luotian's face darkened further. His eyes flashed with killing intent.

The man was strong, and he had been nearby when the kids went missing. He witnessed everything.

The four kids were refining their bodies in Wan Lingkong's array, attempting to leave but failing. They had no choice but to endure the thunderstorms enhanced by the array, which they struggled against but didn't kill them.

However, on the third day after Luotian's group left, an unexpected event occurred. A gray hand appeared out of nowhere and smashed Wan Lingkong's array, forcibly taking the kids.

Wan Lingkong's array wasn't particularly strong. To break it so easily, the attacker must be in the mid-epoch stage. But there were no such people in the Thunder Realm.

Yet, Luotian spotted a familiar figure among the onlookers.

"Han Tian Sect!" Luotian's eyes flashed with coldness. In the man's memories, he saw Han Tian Sect's young sect leader, Yu Letian.

Luotian released the sweating middle-aged man, his face filled with killing intent. He handed him a pill and took off.

Luotian didn't know if this was related to Han Tian Sect's Yu Letian, but the sight of his figure here meant trouble.

Luotian and his group had come to the Thunder Realm. Few knew about it, only Snow Mountain Sect and Han Tian Sect. They had clashed before.

Luotian had thought Yu Letian was just a spoiled brat, but now he regretted his mercy.

"If it's not related to you, then fine. If it is!" Luotian's killing intent surged. He maintained the last sliver of reason, flying toward Han Tian Sect.

Diao Dezhu's group also radiated killing intent. The four kids were the hope of the Four Sacred Star Domains' next generation. If they had truly met disaster, everyone in the Four Sacred Star Domains would go mad.

The middle-aged man's face was terrified, trembling as he stood there. He looked at Luotian's group leaving, clutching the vial.

"Who are these people? Did they cause the battle in the Thunder Sea's depths?" People refining their bodies nearby were shocked, looking at Luotian's group with reverence.

"This..." The middle-aged man opened the vial Luotian gave him. His face changed instantly, sealing it quickly and looking cautiously around. No one paid attention to him, so he sighed in relief.

The man's face was respectful as he bowed toward Luotian's group. He carried the pill like a treasure, flying out of the Thunder Sea.

With immense killing intent, Luotian's group surged with power. Within an hour, they arrived at Han Tian Continent and descended onto Han Tian Sect's sky.

"Han Tian Elder, come out to meet me!" Luotian didn't speak further. His golden foot stepped onto Han Tian Sect's protective array, his cold voice echoing over the sect.

"Crack..." The protective array that could withstand early-epoch attacks shattered like paper under Luotian's foot.

The entire Han Tian Sect trembled. Millions of disciples and elders stared in fear at the powerful figures above.

"Domain Lord Luotian, what brings you to Han Tian Sect?" The Han Tian Elder sensed Luotian's arrival immediately. He appeared before Luotian, his heart shaking at the overwhelming killing intent.

"Yu Letian! Come out!" Luotian's spiritual awareness swept across the entire Han Tian Mountain instantly, finding Yu Letian with terrified eyes.

"Did they find out? Impossible! I hid so well. How could they have found me!" Yu Letian panicked upon seeing Luotian's arrival.

Before he could react, a white hand grabbed him and pulled him to Luotian's front.

"I'll search your soul. Choose wisely!" Luotian spoke coldly, his gaze on Yu Letian, freezing his soul.

Before Yu Letian could speak, Luotian's spiritual awareness surged into his mind, scanning his memories.

"Seems I shouldn't have been merciful. You gave them a chance!" Luotian's eyes turned crimson after reviewing Yu Letian's memories. He squeezed his hands, and Yu Letian's body exploded into a blood mist before him.

Seven-colored flames erupted from Luotian's hands, instantly incinerating Yu Letian into wisps of smoke.

"Domain Lord Luotian, what is your intent!" The Han Tian Elder's heart trembled. He felt a bad premonition.

"Yu Letian of Han Tian Sect colluded with the Chaos Domain, attacked my descendants. Destroy the sect!" Luotian spoke coldly, his crimson gaze on the Han Tian Elder as he rushed toward Mu Hantian.

His heart was filled with regret. He wished he hadn't been merciful, leaving this pest behind. He had thought Yu Letian was just a spoiled brat but forgot that such spoils were vengeful, unaware of the world's harshness.

In Yu Letian's memories, Luotian found he had leaked their location. He didn't know how he contacted the Chaos Domain's forces in the Thunder Realm, so they had taken the kids.

"Dao Seal of Demon Subjugation!" Luotian was human, but his rage demanded blood. He wanted to kill everyone connected with Yu Letian.

With a霸道 punch, Mu Hantian had no time to react. He was struck by Luotian's fist and flew back, his face filled with disbelief.

As Luotian spoke, Mu Hantian knew Yu Letian had brought great trouble to Han Tian Sect. Though he had prepared, Luotian's speed was too fast.

"Little brat!" Mu Hantian trembled, his body flying back while cursing. His eyes showed fear.

He had thought he could rely on Luotian, maintaining close ties with Snow Mountain Sect. But now, it was all ruined by Yu Letian's spoiled brat.

"Domain Lord Luotian, speak reasonably!" Mu Hantian shouted. He couldn't resist in front of Luotian.

"Boom..." Luotian didn't give Mu Hantian a chance to explain. He struck again with a powerful fist, shattering Mu Hantian's body and releasing seven-colored flames that incinerated him.

Two punches, and Han Tian Sect's elder, Mu Hantian of the early-epoch stage, was dead. The sect's disciples and elders stared in disbelief. They couldn't believe their eyes—this无敌 elder was so fragile before the young figure.

"Kill!" Luotian, after killing Mu Hantian, flashed a mad look. His epoch hands repeatedly struck the Han Tian Mountain.

Diao Dezhu's group also attacked, their powerful techniques striking the mountain. Cries echoed throughout Han Tian Mountain as blood stained it. Many disciples hadn't even reacted before being killed.

The entire Han Tian Continent trembled, watching the bloodstained mountain. All sects were in fear, looking at the figure atop Han Tian Mountain with immense power.

"Luotian of the Four Sacred Star Domains!" People later recalled Mu Hantian's name, their eyes filled with reverence.

"Han Tian Sect is finished!" When people knew the attacker was Luotian, they realized Han Tian Continent's first sect had ended.

What was Luotian's cultivation and identity? Han Tian Sect was strong in the Thunder Realm, but against Luotian, it was nothing. The Four Sacred Star Domains were now at their peak. Even圣地圣族 dared not speak, while a small Han Tian Sect couldn't withstand one person.

"Roar..." A wave of souls drifted from the mountain, howling with resentment. They screamed toward Luotian's group.

"Blame yourselves for being born in Han Tian Sect. Blame your young sect leader for targeting my descendants!" Luotian's eyes flashed coldly. He formed seals, summoning fire dragons that erupted into a vast firestorm, annihilating the vengeful souls.

The mountain turned into blood rivers under extreme cold. It was terrifying.

"Go!" Luotian's eyes flashed with fierce killing intent. He and Diao Dezhu's group闪身 out of Han Tian Continent, flying toward the Chaos Domain's forces in the Thunder Realm.

Tian Luo Mountain was where the Chaos Domain stationed its forces in the Thunder Realm. But now, it was empty—no one was there. They had clearly evacuated.

"Damn!" Luotian crushed Tian Luo Mountain, his face cold as he flew toward the Thunder Realm's teleportation array.

The Thunder Realm's teleportation array was set near the Thunder Sea Marsh. They arrived at its entrance shortly after.

"Hongzhe, you carry the Thunder Wheel and stay in the Thunder Realm. Tianzhi needs to recover, as does his body. You don't need to follow us!" They arrived at the teleportation array's location, Luotian spoke to Ren Hongzhe.

"I can help you!" Ren Hongzhe replied, wanting to follow Luotian's group.

"You have a mission. That is, during this time, you and Tianzhi must reestablish control over the Thunder Realm. With an epoch treasure, it shouldn't be too hard. But it will take time. When the clans emerge, the Thunder Realm will be first. Time is short, so you must strengthen quickly!" Luotian sighed deeply, speaking to Ren Hongzhe.
