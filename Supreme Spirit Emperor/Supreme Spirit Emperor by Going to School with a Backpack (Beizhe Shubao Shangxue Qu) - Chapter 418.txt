“What is the current situation in the Thunder Domain?” Upon entering the grand hall, everyone's expressions turned solemn, their gazes turning to Jiang Nanxuan.

“It is dire, but that is our perspective!” Jiang Nanxuan let out a long sigh.

“Do you know why I and Gu Lei entered the Nascent Soul of the Epoch?” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his gaze upon Luo Tian and others. “It was because we obtained a great cultivation boon within the Thunder Sea Marsh.”

“Indeed, we have opened the Grave of Immortals before,” Luo Tian said, his expression grave. “But it seemed to contain a terrifying presence. When the Ancient Royal Clan opened the Grave of Immortals, did they suffer no consequences at all?”

“Not as bad as you imagine,” Jiang Nanxuan continued. “When I and Gu Lei went, we stayed at the periphery, not daring to go too deep. However, we did sense a terrifying aura.”

“According to our investigations, those who opened the Grave of Immortals were Nascent Kings of the Ancient Royal Clan. But after opening it, those Nascent Kings perished!” Jiang Nanxuan’s gaze carried a sense of awe. To annihilate so many Nascent Kings in one go—what terrifying power that must have been.

“This seems like a blessing for us, doesn’t it?” the others asked, confusion in their eyes. “So many Nascent Kings dead—this must have greatly weakened the Ancient Royal Clan.”

“But after great peril comes great opportunity,” Jiang Nanxuan said. “The Nascent Kings who opened the Grave of Immortals sacrificed their lives to create a fissure, releasing an immense power that swept through the entire Thunder Sea Marsh. This power was overwhelmingly strong, yet it contained an unparalleled chance for cultivation. Those who refined it would see a significant rise in their strength.”

Chapter 1641: Re-entering the Mortal Domain

“Many royal heirs and offspring of kings have now flocked to the Thunder Sea Marsh, seeking to refine this opportunity. Some Ancient Royal Clan members have also surrounded the marsh, for the chance is too potent—entirely elevating the strength of the Ancient Royal Clan!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke solemnly.

“Elevate, elevate—what does it matter? We have three great cultivators and Luo Tian’s group. If a battle erupts, the Ancient Royal Clan won’t hold an advantage!” Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Cao Dedu and the others showed no surprise. After all, their strength had also risen; it was natural for the Ancient Royal Clan to grow stronger.

“Indeed, how could the Ancient Royal Clan have all entered the Nascent King stage? In that case, we could find a place to die!” The group murmured低声.

“You’re right,” Jiang Nanxuan said, but his gaze darkened. “However, more troubling is that some of the Nascent Kings who opened the Grave of Immortals have revived. No one knows why they’ve lived another life!”

But this time, Jiang Nanxuan’s words had barely finished when the entire hall fell silent. All eyes turned grave, their breaths catching in their throats.

The reason humanity had reached this state was due to Ji Jiuyou, Gu Tianshu, and Dongbo Xin’s suppression of the Ancient Royal Clan. Among them, Ji Jiuyou and Gu Tianshu had both lived another life—this was humanity’s greatest advantage.

But now, the Ancient Royal Clan had produced so many powerful figures who had lived another life. Where was humanity’s advantage now?

“This is truly a disaster!” Luo Tian sighed deeply upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words.

“What do we do? If it were just one or two, it would be manageable. But now there are four or five of them! What can we do to counter this? Master Ji has passed away, leaving only Dongbo and Gu. The enemy, however, has several!”

The group felt an overwhelming sense of oppression.

“Indeed,” Jiang Nanxuan said. “When we left, we learned that four Nascent Kings of the Ancient Royal Clan had lived another life. However, we couldn’t determine which clan they belonged to. Additionally, many of the Ancient Royal Clan’s royal heirs have also entered the Nascent King stage.”

Jiang Nanxuan looked at Luo Tian.

“Four!” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed deeply, then he sighed. “I’ll go to the Mortal Domain and investigate Star Moon Divine Clan’s situation. Perhaps I can try to forge an alliance with them.”

“During this time, you should focus on refining your strength. Try to reach the Nascent Soul of the Epoch during the battle. I believe when the Ancient Royal Clan emerges from the Thunder Sea Marsh, it will be a time of great conflict!” Luo Tian said softly.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected the Ancient Royal Clan to become so formidable, but with no other options, they could only take it one step at a time. He had to visit the Star Moon Divine Clan, for with his connection to Fu Xingyue, forming an alliance should be no problem.

“Alright,” Luo Tian said. “The good days are over. Zhen Xin and Xu Liyi have still not returned. You all should get moving—go find them!”

After discussing with the others, Luo Tian rose and left the hall, heading toward Fu Xingxuan’s residence.

Fu Xingxuan had been staying with Jiang Sxi and three others. When not occupied, she also visited Zhang Qiuyue—after all, that was her future mother-in-law. She needed to maintain good relations.

When Luo Tian arrived at Fu Xingxuan’s residence, she had just returned from Zhang Qiuyue. Seeing Luo Tian’s serious expression, her face shifted slightly.

“What is it?” Fu Xingxuan asked, confusion in her eyes. She sensed Luo Tian’s heavy mood.

“Nothing serious. We should go to the Star Moon Divine Clan,” Luo Tian said with a small smile.

“Really?” Fu Xingxuan’s face lit up. She had been in the Four Sacred Star Domains for some time now and was adapting to life there. Still, she missed her father and two brothers.

“Yeah,” Luo Tian smiled. “Pack your things. I’ll wait for you here.”

Fu Xingxuan’s eyes gleamed with excitement, then she rushed into her room. A short while later, she emerged.

They transformed into two streaks of light, vanishing from the Tianyuan Continent. Soon after, they appeared in the Four Sacred Star Domains, heading toward the entrance of the Mortal Domain.

At the same time, Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi, Cao Dedu and others also took action. They divided themselves among various star domains to search for Chen Zhanbiao and Wan Lingkong. The entire Tianyuan Continent stirred again.

Not only the Four Sacred Star Domains, but Luo Tian also sent messages to other star domains. After all, opposing the Ancient Royal Clan was not just a matter for the Four Sacred Star Domains. Luo Tian wasn’t that noble.

Within half a day, Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan reached the entrance of the Mortal Domain. With their current strength, evading the guards at the entrance was too simple—especially since Luo Tian had no need to hide from humanity.

“We’re entering the Mortal Domain!” Luo Tian said to the two guards at the entrance. Then he grabbed Fu Xingxuan and rushed into the domain. At that moment, Luo Tian put on his Thousand Mirage Mask.

“Hum…” A ripple spread out. Immediately, Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan appeared beneath the gray星空 of the Mortal Domain.

“Who is it?” As they entered, two voices questioned in Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan’s ears.

“Old acquaintances,” Luo Tian said, smiling at the two Ancient Royal Clan guards who had transformed into Star Moon Divine Clan’s appearance.

They were none other than the fourth and fifth sons of the Crimson Phoenix Clan. Their faces bore caution as they looked at Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan.

“Star Moon Divine Clan? Fu Xingxuan?” The next moment, they recognized Fu Xingxuan. Their gazes turned to Luo Tian, eyes filled with confusion.

“Fu Xingxuan, you didn’t betray the Ancient Royal Clan before? How dare you return! Who is he?” The fourth son of the Crimson Phoenix Clan’s prince said, his expression grave as he questioned Fu Xingxuan.

“You have no right to ask! I’m returning to see my father. Move aside!” Fu Xingxuan replied fiercely, her expression darkening. She ignored them and led Luo Tian forward toward the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Not allowed! Who is he? You must explain!” They flew forward to block Fu Xingxuan and Luo Tian, their gazes on Luo Tian.

Fu Xingxuan had once escaped the Mortal Domain with Luo Tian, and together they had killed two royal offspring. This was well-known within the Ancient Royal Clan. Now Fu Xingxuan had returned, accompanied by a man whose aura was identical to that of the Star Moon Divine Clan. It was no wonder they suspected him of being Luo Tian.

“You have no right to interfere! Move aside, or I won’t be polite!” Fu Xingxuan’s expression turned cold. Her aura erupted violently, sending an invisible wave toward them.

Fu Xingxuan had nearly vanished for a time, but her cultivation hadn’t dropped. She was now approaching the Nascent King stage. The fourth and fifth sons of the Crimson Phoenix Clan were at the peak of their era, but they still felt a powerful pressure from Fu Xingxuan.

“Princess, this is trivial. Let me handle it!” Before Fu Xingxuan could speak further, Luo Tian smiled and addressed her.

“Hmph,” Fu Xingxuan nodded. Since they had already guessed, there was no need for politeness. Luo Tian’s strength could easily deal with them.

“Hum…” The two weren’t foolish. This man was suspected to be Luo Tian, and they didn’t dare to confront him directly. Luo Tian had a fearsome reputation within the Ancient Royal Clan, having killed royal offspring before. They didn’t believe Luo Tian had made no progress over the years. Without hesitation, they pulled out their identity tokens to contact their clan.

But just as they took out the tokens, a powerful pressure immediately affected them. Their movements halted. Luo Tian smiled at them and took a step forward.

“Damn!” The two froze in place under the immense pressure. Their gazes were filled with shock as they looked at Luo Tian, unable to believe that he hadn’t even drawn his sword and yet had them in such a state.

“Crack…” With each step Luo Tian took, cracks rose beneath his feet in the星空. At the same time, the two felt their pressure increase, as if a mountain had pressed upon their backs. With each step Luo Tian took, the mountain’s weight grew heavier.

“Since you once protected me when my father was in the Star Moon Divine Clan, I won’t take your lives. But you’ll have to endure a little while longer!” Luo Tian spoke softly, approaching the two.

As he reached them, their bodies bent completely. Cold sweat dripped from their faces as they looked at Luo Tian in disbelief.

“Is he a Nascent King? Even if it’s a Nascent King, the pressure shouldn’t be this strong!” Their minds were filled with terror. They looked at Luo Tian, who smiled, and couldn’t believe that he hadn’t even drawn his sword yet and had them so helpless.

“Ah…” Thinking this, their hearts roared in defiance. Their bodies surged with energy and slowly straightened.

“Not bad!” As they resisted Luo Tian’s pressure, slowly standing upright, a golden hand suddenly struck them. It smashed them back down.

Chapter 1642: The Crisis of the Star Moon Divine Clan

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed from the fourth and fifth sons of the Crimson Phoenix Clan. They were like flies before this golden hand, instantly smashed downward into the星空.

The two were stunned by Luo Tian’s strike. They hadn’t expected to be so easily defeated in his hands, as if they were the ones crushed by Gu Tianshu during the era of old.

“Hum…” Before they could react, the golden hand swept again. It grabbed them and sealed their cultivation with a continuous flow of sealing power.

“Go!” Luo Tian waved his sleeve, collecting them. He smiled at Fu Xingxuan, who was stunned.

Fu Xingxuan was shocked. Though she had expected Luo Tian to be strong, she hadn’t anticipated he had become this powerful. Two peak-era Nascent Kings were completely powerless in his hands, captured instantly.

Seeing Fu Xingxuan’s stunned expression, Luo Tian felt a sense of pride. He said to her: “How about that? Your husband is mighty, right?”

“Pfft…” Fu Xingxuan spat. “Hurry up and go. If someone discovers they’re missing, it might cause trouble!”

“Hmm…” They moved swiftly, transforming into two streaks of light toward the Star Moon Divine Clan.

At this moment, the Star Moon Divine Clan faced a massive crisis. Everyone’s faces were filled with anger and despair.

“Haha, Star Moon Divine Emperor? That’s it?” A cold voice echoed through the Star Moon Divine Clan. A youth, his body glowing with starlight, stood on a man in royal robes—Fu Xingyang.

Around them were many people clad in black, their auras rising high. Their gazes turned toward the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Cough… Fu Tu, are you rebelling?” Fu Xingyang coughed blood, his chest caved in. His face was pale as he looked at the youth who had stepped on him.

“Rebellion? The Star Moon Divine Clan was founded by my father. Without my father, could the Star Moon Divine Clan be where it is today? I am my father’s offspring. The Star Moon Divine Clan was always mine!”

“You’ll be spared if you cooperate, but if you conspire with humanity, I’m merely reclaiming what is mine!” Fu Tu’s face was twisted with cruelty. He pressed his foot down again, speaking coldly.

“Crack…” Fu Xingyang’s body shattered under Fu Tu’s foot, turning into a mist of blood. He then reformed, his cultivation plummeting.

Fu Xingyang had ruled the Star Moon Divine Clan with diligence over the years, managing it meticulously. With the resources accumulated in the Star Moon Divine Clan, he had become a Nascent King.

But now, he was severely wounded and crushed by Fu Tu’s foot. Clearly, Fu Tu had reached a terrifying level.

“From today on, the Star Moon Divine Clan belongs to me. Who among you不服?” Fu Tu smiled, looking at the gathered Star Moon Divine Clan elders.

“Haha, we conspired with humanity. Then who are they?” Fu Xingyang, after regenerating his blood, looked at the black-cloaked people Fu Tu had brought. Though they were well-concealed, he felt the aura of humanity on them.

“I won’t submit…” The commander of the Star Moon Divine Guard, Kou Tiande, immediately stepped forward. His gaze was resolute.

“I won’t submit either… I won’t submit…” With Kou Tiande leading, many Star Moon Divine Clan members stood up. The three major armies of the Star Moon Divine Clan led with cries that soared into the sky.

“Record it,” Fu Tu said to the black-cloaked people, his gaze cold.

“Yes…” Many of them nodded. Then they looked at Kou Tiande and Fu Ziming with cold eyes, the atmosphere of killing filling the air.

“Go back…” Fu Xingyang looked at those who had stood up. They were the backbone of the Star Moon Divine Clan, many having followed him and Fu Xingyue for years.

“Fu Tu, are you really rebelling against the Star Moon Divine Clan? Right now, the elders aren’t here. If they return, do you think you can hold your position?” Fu Xingyang spoke to Fu Tu.

But Fu Xingyang was also desperate. He had become a Nascent King, but Fu Tu’s group contained at least two Nascent Kings. He had been surrounded and attacked by three, hence his current state.

Three Nascent Kings—within the Star Moon Divine Clan, including Fu Xingyang and Fu Wenbin, and Elder Fu Cangshan, there were only three Nascent Kings. Though Fu Xingyue was strong, over the years, resources had been concentrated on Fu Xingyang. Hence, Fu Xingyue hadn’t yet entered the Nascent King stage.

Moreover, the two Nascent Kings Fu Tu had brought were stronger than him. Each was no weaker than Fu Tu. He faced three Nascent Kings and had been crushed immediately.

“Haha, don’t think I don’t know. Fu Cangshan the old man has entered the Thunder Sea Marsh to open the Grave of Immortals. Perhaps he’s already dead. The rest are just useless people. Even if they’ve gained some opportunities and become Nascent Kings, as long as they haven’t lived another life, they’ll be crushed by me. No one can save you today!” Fu Tu spoke softly.

“Kill them all!” Fu Tu’s gaze was cold. He ordered the black-cloaked people, his voice devoid of mercy.

“Kill…” Upon hearing Fu Tu’s words, the black-cloaked people rushed toward Kou Tiande and Fu Ziming.

“Kill…” Kou Tiande and Fu Ziming also showed madness. They knew this battle was a death trap, for each of Fu Tu’s three Nascent Kings could crush them effortlessly.

“Massacre…” It was a one-sided massacre. No need for Fu Tu’s three Nascent Kings to act, the black-cloaked people were enough to crush Kou Tiande and others.

One by one, Star Moon Divine Clan members fell under the black-cloaked people’s hands. The scent of blood spread across the Star Moon Divine Clan’s land, making Fu Xingyang’s heart bleed. Especially when he saw Kou Tiande be split in half by a black-cloaked person, turning into blood mist, Fu Xingyang could no longer control himself and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“You don’t need to worry. You’ll join them soon, as well as your brother and those two old men!” Fu Tu’s face was cruel. He spoke to Fu Xingyang.

“Your wish has come true!” Just as Fu Tu’s words finished, a furious voice echoed from the sky. Two streaks of light pierced through the heavens toward Fu Tu.

“Hmph?” Upon hearing the voice, the two black-cloaked youths behind Fu Tu’s back turned pale. Their gazes became serious.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed, golden light with overwhelming aura instantly appeared before Fu Tu.

Fu Tu turned around and saw a golden fist. Though not particularly strong, it was covered with complex seals.

Fu Tu had no time to identify who the person was. He swung his fist toward the golden fist that brought him a great sense of danger.

“Crack…” The thunderous sound was overwhelming. A violent gust swept out, the ground cracking in pieces. At the same time, Fu Tu’s body was pushed back with a stunned expression.

“Sister…” A purple figure instantly appeared before Fu Xingyang, her voice filled with concern.

“Xingxuan?” Fu Xingyang recognized the voice immediately. His face showed excitement, then turned heavy.

“Sister, how are you?” Fu Xingxuan grabbed Fu Xingyang and looked at him with concern.

“Sister, why did you return? You came at the worst time!” Fu Xingyang’s face showed bitterness. The Star Moon Divine Clan was in great danger, and Fu Xingxuan had returned—this was no different from walking into death.

“Uncle, don’t worry. I’m here!” Luo Tian smiled and looked at Fu Xingyang’s pale face.

“You…” Fu Xingyang was stunned, immediately recognizing Luo Tian. His desperate gaze turned into hope.

“Commander!” The Star Moon Divine Guard, who had been slaughtered continuously, immediately recognized Luo Tian. Their faces turned excited.

“Luo Tian!” Fu Tu had just fought with Luo Tian and returned. Upon seeing the one who had attacked him was Luo Tian, his face turned wild.

Humiliation—Fu Tu’s greatest humiliation since he had emerged was meeting Luo Tian. He had nearly been destroyed by him before. Over the years, Fu Tu’s greatest wish was to personally wash away that humiliation. Therefore, when those people found him, he hadn’t hesitated and agreed.

“Luo Tian!” Not only Fu Tu, but the two Nascent Kings accompanying Fu Tu also turned pale upon hearing Fu Tu call Luo Tian’s name. Their gazes were filled with intense killing intent, and a terrifying aura radiated from them.

“Ah?” Luo Tian smiled slightly. He glanced at Fu Tu, then looked at the two black-cloaked people behind him. His eyes narrowed slightly.

“Ah, it’s you!” Luo Tian looked at their faces. Though they had disguised themselves, he still recognized them.

“Luo Tian? Isn’t that the human clan’s prodigy?” The Star Moon Divine Clan people, who had been scared by Fu Tu’s iron-fisted methods and hadn’t dared to stand up before, now looked confused and whispered among themselves.

“Is the second commander of the Star Moon Divine Guard Luo Tian?”

“No way, I remember the previous commander was that human clan’s genius. Is this one also?” The Star Moon Divine Clan people whispered, looking at Luo Tian. Their initial excitement turned into confusion.

The Ancient Royal Clan had always hated the human clan, and this hadn’t changed. The Star Moon Divine Clan had previously been lenient toward Luo Tian due to their relationship, and with Fu Wenbin and Elder Fu Cangshan publicly supporting Luo Tian, some high-ranking members of the Star Moon Divine Clan knew that Luo Tian had a friendly relationship with them. But this was an implicit understanding; it was the first time Luo Tian had appeared openly before all of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Luo Tian, I didn’t expect to meet you here!” The two people behind Fu Tu, their faces filled with madness and killing intent, stepped forward toward Fu Tu. They stared coldly at Luo Tian.

“Deserted dogs! I didn’t expect you to dare come to the Star Moon Divine Clan!” Luo Tian’s thoughts were deep. These two weren’t anyone—Sun Zhangyang of the Divine Clan and Nan Gong Wuyi of the Demon Clan. They had escaped from Luo Tian’s hands before, and he hadn’t expected to meet them here.

“Deserted dogs!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuyi’s faces turned dark with blood. They were as resentful of Luo Tian as Fu Tu.

“Today I’ll see who the desert dog is!” Sun Zhangyang’s face was cold. He spoke confidently.

At this moment, they had three people against Luo Tian alone. Fu Xingyang was no longer combat-ready and could be ignored. He didn’t believe three kings’ offspring and Nascent Kings couldn’t kill one Luo Tian.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his thoughts serious. The three of them were no ordinary people; their strength was much greater than that of regular Nascent Kings and Nascent Epochs.

But Luo Tian also had confidence. Over the years, his cultivation hadn’t dropped. In fact, he had gained much strength from entering dangerous places.

“Since becoming a Nascent Epoch, this is my first life-or-death battle. Three kings’ offspring—what can you do? See how much progress you’ve made over the years!” Luo Tian muttered, his thoughts also filled with confusion about how the three had joined forces.

“After waiting so long, I’ve finally reached this day. Though it came earlier than expected, it’s better to settle the matter now!” Nan Gong Wuyi’s body was filled with black energy, darkening the sky. He spoke to Luo Tian.

“Come at me all together!” Luo Tian said softly, then extended his hand. The sky was torn open, and he vanished into the void.

They could ignore the Star Moon Divine Clan, but Luo Tian had to care. After all, a Nascent King’s battle could cause heavy losses for the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Follow me!” Fu Xingxuan’s face was cold. She looked at the blood-stained ground and spoke, her purple sword appearing in her hand. Then she moved swiftly toward Fu Tu’s group of black-cloaked people.

“Kill!” Fu Xingyang looked at the void deeply, his gaze filled with hope. He moved swiftly toward those black-cloaked people.

With Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue leading, the entire Star Moon Divine Clan moved. After all, their positions were deeply rooted in the people’s hearts. Both had taken action, so they couldn’t just watch. Moreover, among those who died were their relatives. The battle erupted again within the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Boom…” The void cracked as Luo Tian, his body glowing with golden light like a war god, collided with Fu Tu. He took two steps back, then swung another fist toward Sun Zhangyang. His back absorbed Nan Gong Wuyi’s attack, his qi shaking violently before he was thrown far away.

“Not bad!” The three of them looked down on Luo Tian, their eyes filled with excitement. If they could kill Luo Tian now, it would eliminate this major threat and also dispel their inner demons. They immediately rushed toward Luo Tian again.

“Seems I need to use real strength now,” Luo Tian muttered, his gaze serious. He quickly bent his body and launched himself into the void with incredible speed, appearing before Sun Zhangyang. His golden fist radiated overwhelming power, striking toward Sun Zhangyang.

Luo Tian’s speed was too fast. He had used the Sealing King’s Battle Technique, and his combat power reached its peak.

This was Luo Tian’s first all-out battle since becoming a Nascent Epoch. With several great techniques加持, he was invincible—his speed and power far exceeded ordinary Nascent Epochs.

“Crack…” A cracking sound echoed through the void. Gray void currents battered Luo Tian’s body, while Sun Zhangyang’s eyes were filled with disbelief. He spat blood and was thrown back.

The void trembled. The next moment, Sun Zhangyang was sent flying out of the void and into the sky above the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Is it Fu Tu’s human!” The next moment, the Star Moon Divine Clan people were in a uproar. Their faces showed excitement as they looked up at the void.

“Too strong! If he were our commander, it would be great!” The Star Moon Divine Clan people sighed. One man fighting three Nascent Kings, and Luo Tian hadn’t fallen behind.

“Damn!” Sun Zhangyang’s face was grim. He wiped the blood from his mouth, surprised he had still been sent flying by Luo Tian despite having reached the Nascent Epoch.

“Sealing King’s Battle Technique, the Divine Clan’s King’s secret technique. How did he obtain it!” But soon after, Sun Zhangyang’s face turned grim. He had once valued the King’s inheritance in the Divine Clan but hadn’t had time to retrieve it before Luo Tian attacked.

Thinking of the Divine Clan, Sun Zhangyang’s face turned even grimmer. He rushed back into the void.

But before he could enter, a black figure suddenly transformed into a streak of darkness and rushed toward him. The speed shocked Sun Zhangyang.

“Boom…” The next moment, the black streak collided with him. It sent Sun Zhangyang flying out of the void again.

This time was even harsher. Sun Zhangyang directly collided with the ground, creating a deep pit in the battlefield between the Star Moon Divine Clan and those black-cloaked people. The entire land trembled.

“What’s going on? Who is it this time?” The Star Moon Divine Clan people were curious. With Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingyang’s actions, the black-cloaked people had been nearly slaughtered.

They looked at the dark pit. Though it was dim, they could clearly see what was inside. Then they saw a scene that left them speechless.

“Truly disgusting!” The Star Moon Divine Clan people’s faces showed disgust.

“Hmph?” Sun Zhangyang was stunned. When he regained his senses, he felt pain all over and a wetness on his lips.

But soon after, Sun Zhangyang’s eyes widened. He saw another pair of black eyes staring back at him. His eyes were wide with shock, and time paused for a moment.

“Ugh…” The next moment, Sun Zhangyang tried to scream but found his lips blocked by something.

“Damn… spit!” Nan Gong Wuyi immediately jumped off Sun Zhangyang, his stomach churning. They had both been disgusted by their own actions.

“Why are you so annoying!” Nan Gong Wuyi cursed inwardly. He looked at Sun Zhangyang, who was also vomiting, and didn’t know how to speak. They had both been sent flying by Luo Tian, and coincidentally, Sun Zhangyang returned just in time—there was no more to it.

Seeing the Star Moon Divine Clan people’s strange gazes, both of them felt their faces burn for the first time in their lives. However, they also radiated powerful killing intent and looked at the Star Moon Divine Clan people with the desire to kill those who had seen their disgrace.

“Come here quickly, I can’t hold on much longer!” Just as they were about to attack, Fu Tu’s voice echoed from the void. Their bodies shook and abandoned their desire to kill the Star Moon Divine Clan people, then they pushed off the ground and rushed back into the void.

“Terrifying!” The Star Moon Divine Clan people instinctively shivered. They felt a cold wind on their necks, as if it could take their lives at any moment. Their fates were no longer in their own hands.

“A Nascent King, so terrifying! Luo Tian could fight three of them alone. How terrifying he must be!” The next moment, the Star Moon Divine Clan people’s faces showed reverence as they looked at the void that had healed itself.

“Spit…” As people marveled, Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingyang had also slaughtered all of Fu Tu’s subordinates. They looked at the void, their faces filled with worry.

They knew that the real battle was still between the four of them. If Luo Tian lost, all their efforts would be in vain.

“Sigh… if my cultivation hadn’t dropped, I might have been able to help him!” Fu Xingyang’s eyes showed regret. He knew how terrifying Fu Tu and his two companions were. Although Luo Tian was strong in his mind, seeing the situation now—Luo Tian had the upper hand. Still, Fu Xingyang felt deep concern.

Chapter 1643: The Old Opponent

“Boom…” Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuyi rushed into the void. Immediately, a thunderous sound echoed in their ears. Their vision showed Fu Tu and Luo Tian colliding repeatedly, Fu Tu’s body covered with star patterns—evidently enhanced by some secret technique.

Even so, he was constantly sent flying back, his body in disarray and cracks appearing on it.

“Kill…” Seeing Fu Tu retreating, Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuyi roared. Their bodies radiated overwhelming energy, their qi surging. They transformed into two streaks of light and rushed toward Luo Tian, stronger than before—evidently having used a secret technique to enhance their bodies.

“Good!” Luo Tian laughed, looking at Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wuyi rushing toward him. He showed no fear. A series of punches shot from his hands, fighting against the three of them.

The gray void constantly cracked under their collisions. Fu Tu and the other two had used secret techniques, finally no longer being suppressed by Luo Tian’s Sealing King Battle Technique. Instead, they had now suppressed Luo Tian.

“Manifesting the World of Gods!” Luo Tian’s hands formed a seal. His body suddenly expanded to thousands of feet, radiating overwhelming power. Golden seals flowed across his massive body.

“Fury of the Barbarian God, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. He immediately used his ultimate technique, a golden foot stomping through the void.

Luo Tian was now a Nascent Epoch. His body had always been strong, and with the enhancement of Manifesting the World of Gods, his footstep technique could crush any Nascent King—unless it was a person who had lived another life.

The golden foot, radiating overwhelming power, made Fu Tu and the other two’s faces turn grim. Facing such a powerful strike from Luo Tian, they dared not be careless. Their bodies radiated terrifying energy and their hands changed rapidly.

“God’s Sigh!” A golden figure appeared behind Sun Zhangyang, as if the Epoch Master had returned. It radiated overwhelming power and raised its hands to the sky.

“Demon’s Destruction of All Beings!” Similarly, a black demon shadow appeared behind Nan Gong Wuyi. It radiated terrifying power and extended its hands toward Luo Tian’s golden foot.

Chapter 1644: Power
