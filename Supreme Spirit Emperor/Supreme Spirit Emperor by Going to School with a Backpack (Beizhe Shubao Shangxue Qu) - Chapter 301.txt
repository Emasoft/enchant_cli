“Not selling! I’ll continue refining pills in the next few days; everyone is welcome to watch!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the people of the Third Island.

“Boom…” A moment later, the crowd erupted in astonishment, their eyes filled with admiration as they gazed at Luo Tian.

The Third Island housed many alchemists, and nearly sixty percent of the attendees were alchemists. Luo Tian’s earlier elixirs, which had been sent out by Shen Gongfei to sell, had caused a stir. They naturally knew the unique qualities of Luo Tian’s elixirs and puzzled over why his alchemical energy was so potent.

To allow other alchemists to witness one’s refining process was an act of great generosity. Luo Tian’s gesture had won the profound respect of the gathered alchemists.

“Damn it, why haven’t those three arrived yet!” Hu Jianhua stood among the crowd, cursing inwardly. His gaze burned with resentment as he stared at Luo Tian.

“Thank you, Deputy Island Master!” The Third Island’s alchemists looked at Luo Tian with reverence. That title was spoken from the depths of their hearts, as Luo Tian’s actions had fully earned their approval.

“Excellent, so quickly gaining the recognition of so many alchemists!” Shen Gongfu smiled, standing in his courtyard and murmuring to himself.

“But the true test lies in strength,” Shen Gongfu’s face bore anticipation, his small eyes gleaming with intensity.

Luo Tian waved his hand, placing the Tremendous Heaven Elixir into Yang Jinghua’s hands. “Give it a try; there shouldn’t be any problems!”

“Alright,” Yang Jinghua simply replied, his eyes filled with gratitude. He took the elixir without hesitation and swallowed it.

“That’s Yang Jinghua of the Second Island! The Deputy Island Master must have refined this elixir for the prodigy Yang Jinghua!” The Third Island’s people displayed surprise. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to so quickly establish ties with Yang Jinghua, whose name was known throughout the Seven Star Islands.

“Hum…” Yang Jinghua sat cross-legged, a crimson dragon of energy encircling him. The elixir’s effects were clearly taking hold.

“Kid, you won’t get another chance to refine!” As the crowd marveled at what would happen after Yang Jinghua consumed the elixir, three figures emerged from the shadows above. They loomed over Luo Tian with a commanding presence.

“They’ve arrived,” Luo Tian frowned slightly, gazing at the three aged figures above. Their battle spirit surged.

“Three half-step Epochs?” Luo Tian assessed their cultivation, sighing inwardly at the abilities of Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua. They had truly managed to summon three half-step Epoch masters.

“Those are the Second Island’s Grand Alchemist, Ning Xiuzhe; the Fourth Island’s Grand Alchemist, Meng Xingyuan; and the Fifth Island’s Grand Alchemist, Sun Shaoyun!” The Third Island’s people immediately recognized the three.

“Endless trouble,” Luo Tian’s eyes bore a look of resignation as he gazed at the three. He withdrew his sword, Wuya.

“I cannot intervene,” Ning Xiuzhe spoke from above, his gaze fixed on Yang Jinghua.

“I am here to guard the Second Island’s prodigy; I must protect him!” Ning Xiuzhe immediately flew toward Yang Jinghua, raising a barrier to shield him.

At the same time, Ning Xiuzhe flicked his hand, sending a streak of light toward Hu Jianhua in the crowd.

“This…” Hu Jianhua caught it, his face darkening. He knew Ning Xiuzhe had changed his mind.

Earlier, when he had summoned Ning Xiuzhe, he had used the curse power within Yang Jinghua as an excuse. He had promised that if Ning Xiuzhe acted, Hu Jian’an would refine a pill to suppress the curse for a month and give it to Yang Jinghua. That was how he had convinced Ning Xiuzhe.

“Ah, the Second Island’s Grand Alchemist!” The crowd turned their attention to Hu Jianhua. They then recalled Luo Tian’s earlier act of stomping on Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua, their gazes shifting with new meaning.

“Apologies,” Ning Xiuzhe addressed Hu Jianhua before turning to Luo Tian, his eyes filled with admiration.

“Without you, it would have been the same,” Meng Xingyuan and Sun Shaoyun’s faces bore slight annoyance, yet they remained confident.

“You’re quite self-assured,” Luo Tian leapt into the air, standing opposite them with no fear in his gaze.

“Touched by the half-step Epochs of the蛮族, I’ll see how strong these Seven Star Islands’ half-step Epochs are!” Luo Tian inwardly sneered, dismissing the two old men.

“Young man, you should respect your elders,” Meng Xingyuan spoke coldly. “When a junior meets an elder, they should show reverence, don’t you know?”

“You’re nothing! I am the Deputy Island Master of the Third Island, and my status is far higher than yours. Why don’t you come and pay your respects immediately? You dare to attack me, this is insubordination!” Luo Tian cursed them outright. The two old men were shameless and sought a reason to attack him, so he would give them one.

“Die!” Meng Xingyuan and Sun Shaoyun’s faces darkened completely. They glanced at the surrounding crowd before speaking softly, “This isn’t a place for combat; let’s move elsewhere.”

“Though you two old men are shameless, I like your shamelessness. It feels so good to beat you!”

“You set the stage; I’ll follow. But be sure, don’t beg for help later—don’t end up crying to your masters endlessly. If you want help, bring them all at once; I’ll finish them all while I’m free!” Luo Tian’s arrogance was unshakable, his gaze filled with contempt as he looked at them.

Chapter 1247: Battle Against the Half-Step Epochs

Under the black sky, Luo Tian stood with disdain, facing two old men of the half-step Epoch. The other two islands’ Grand Alchemists.

“Young man, don’t be so arrogant. We’ve met many geniuses; Guan Xingjian and Hu Tianzong never spoke to us like this!” Zhang Shaojun’s face bore coldness as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Old man, do you have any shame? What did I do to offend you? You came directly to our Third Island and wanted to attack me. How dare you act so old-fashioned? Do I need to cut off my hands and let you deal with me? You talk too much. Third Island’s elders and disciples, step back! I’ll deal with these two old men who came to show off their power!” Luo Tian’s battle spirit surged as he addressed the crowd.

“Deputy Island Master, your might!” The Third Island’s people shouted in unison, gazing at Luo Tian. Their eyes held contempt for Meng Xingyuan and Sun Shaoyun as they shouted, creating ample space for the battle.

“Young man, are you determined to fight here? This will destroy our Third Island!” Meng Xingyuan spoke, his voice icy.

“Save the nonsense,” Luo Tian had no patience for further words. He transformed into a meteor, rushing toward Meng Xingyuan with a punch.

“Die! If you want to destroy the Third Island, what do we have to fear?” Meng Xingyuan’s face turned cold. Starlight rose from his fists, colliding with Luo Tian.

“You’re the one who’s dead!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness, his inner sneer as he unleashed the Fan Tian Attack Technique through his arm, striking Meng Xingyuan.

Golden lightning erupted between their collision, illuminating the sky and shaking the ground. The invisible waves caused Luo Tian’s ruined courtyard to be further eroded.

The sound of bones breaking echoed under the black sky as Meng Xingyuan spat blood, flying backward and crashing through a row of buildings before being buried in the ruins.

“Idiot!” Luo Tian’s eyes held mockery. He could withstand even the蛮族’s flesh, and Meng Xingyuan, a mere half-step Epoch, was no stronger than a piece of paper.

“Boom…” The crowd erupted in astonishment, their gazes filled with awe. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so formidable.

Previously, when Luo Tian had stomped on Hu Jianhua and Hu Jian’an, they had known his strength. However, Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua were at the peak of the Sage realm, one level below Luo Tian’s half-step Epoch.

Now, Luo Tian had punched a half-step Epoch into flight, prompting the crowd to reassess his strength. In their eyes, this power was comparable to that of two prodigies.

Ning Xiuzhe stood within his barrier, his face filled with disbelief. He glanced at the seated Yang Jinghua and sighed inwardly—Yang Jinghua had gained another rival.

Though Yang Jinghua was at the peak of the Sage realm, Ning Xiuzhe knew he had been restrained by the curse power. If not for that curse, Yang Jinghua could have reached the half-step Epoch or even the early Epoch stage, capable of rivaling Guan Xingjian and Hu Tianzong.

“Red Blood Dragon Seal!” As the crowd marveled, a crimson dragon surged from Sun Shaoyun’s hands, swirling in the dark sky. It transformed into a blood-red seal, pressing down toward Luo Tian.

“Flesh isn’t enough; you’re resorting to techniques now?” Luo Tian assessed the blood-red seal’s power, his disdain deepening.

“Let you feel despair! The Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram!” Luo Tian’s hands glowed with gold, and nine divine diagrams erupted from his grasp, rushing toward the blood-red seal.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous collision of golden diagrams and the crimson seal shook the Third Island, causing another tremor that startled many within.

Numerous buildings collapsed again, covering an area of dozens of miles in ruins, leaving the Third Island’s people stunned.

“Stop! Your mother, stop!” As the crowd marveled, a piercing scream echoed out. A plump figure suddenly appeared in their view.

“Too late!” Luo Tian’s lips curled coldly as he pressed his hand into the void. The golden diagram erupted with ten thousand feet of light, shattering the crimson seal and pressing down toward Sun Shaoyun.

“Block it!” Sun Shaoyun’s eyes narrowed, his hands lifting the sky to block the diagram. His face bore madness.

“Boom…” The next moment, the massive Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram crushed Sun Shaoyun’s ancient body, landing on the ground with a deep pit appearing in their view.

“Damn!” Shen Gongfu’s lips twitched as he watched Luo Tian, his eyes filled with regret. He shouted loudly: “What are you doing!”

Shen Gongfu was stunned. He had intended to use Meng Xingyuan and Sun Shaoyun to test Luo Tian’s strength, but he had forgotten their power. If things went wrong, the entire Third Island might be destroyed.

“To Shen Gongfu, these were all white money. Even a slight loss made him regretful. Destroying so much was enough to make Shen Gongfu cry for half a day.”

“Deputy Island Master, you’ve attacked us with your fists. You handle it!” Meng Xingyuan spoke directly, scolding Luo Tian.

“Cough… Cough…” Sun Shaoyun’s ancient body emerged from the pit, battered and torn. His gaze met Luo Tian with a flicker of fear—he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so strong. One strike had left him in such a state.

“Old man, do you have any shame?” Luo Tian stood above the sky, his foot descending toward Meng Xingyuan.

“Stop!” Shen Gongfu gritted his teeth, flying to Luo Tian’s side. His white arm extended, striking Luo Tian’s thigh.

“Boom…” Luo Tian hadn’t had time to retract his foot, colliding with Shen Gongfu’s fist like a steamed bun.

Both men retreated several steps, their eyes filled with disbelief. Luo Tian was shocked that Shen Gongfu had blocked his foot; Shen Gongfu was equally surprised at Luo Tian’s flesh strength, having used eight-tenths of his power without gaining an advantage.

“This Shen Gongfu isn’t simple at all,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, realizing Shen Gongfu was not as simple as he appeared.

“Island Master, don’t worry; I’ll compensate for all the damage, double!” Luo Tian knew why Shen Gongfu had intercepted him. His eyes held a smile as he transmitted to Shen Gongfu.

“Really?” Shen Gongfu raised his eyebrows, his small eyes flashing with light again. If so, the damage caused by the three would be compensated double—meaning it was a profit!

“Triple!” Shen Gongfu transmitted, thinking Luo Tian might still have value.

“Island Master, don’t be so greedy!” Luo Tian looked at Shen Gongfu with a bitter expression, his voice filled with sarcasm.

“Three times it is,” Shen Gongfu persisted, determined.

“Alright!” Luo Tian nodded immediately, inwardly sneering. After all, it wasn’t his money; the number of times didn’t matter.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram!” After negotiating with Shen Gongfu, Luo Tian raised his hand and unleashed the diagram again, pressing it toward Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan.

“You!” The two men, seeing Luo Tian attack them directly in front of Shen Gongfu, turned pale. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to strike them so soon.

But they weren’t fools. They raised a barrier and unleashed their techniques toward the diagram, hoping to block Luo Tian’s Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram.

“Fan Tian Attack!” Luo Tian’s eyes held contempt as he pointed, sending golden script dragons into the diagram. This made the already heavy diagram surge even more, like a blazing sun crushing everything.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The thunderous collision of the two techniques shook the sky, and Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan’s techniques shattered under Luo Tian’s full-force diagram. They were crushed again.

“Powerful!” Shen Gongfu, his plump face watching the diagram with five times its attack power, sighed inwardly. If it were him, could he have blocked it?

The diagram instantly descended upon the two men, pressing down with immense pressure. Their bodies began to crack, as if they could collapse at any moment.

“Open!” Meng Xingyuan and Sun Shaoyun roared, drawing on their remaining strength. Their arms glowed with saintly power and finally broke through the diagram, but at the cost of their arms being completely destroyed.

“Is that all you’ve got?” As they caught their breath, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in their ears, sending chills down their spines.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon!” Luo Tian stepped with the幽冥鬼步, appearing like a ghost behind them. He struck both men in the back with one punch each.

“Crack…” Their bodies exploded again, turning into two bloodied figures that smashed through more buildings, appearing in the crowd’s view.

“Hit more!” Shen Gongfu stood there, calculating his losses.

Chapter 1248: Seven Star Sword Array

“Luo Tian, don’t push it too far!” Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan struggled to stand, their gazes on Luo Tian filled with madness. They regretted deeply; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so strong, defeating them both without a chance.

“I’m the one who’s overstepping? Who is truly overstepping? Everyone can see. Now that you can’t fight, you want me to stop—do you think I’m some kind of good guy? I’ve only just arrived at the Seven Star Islands, but I’m not someone any dog can bully!” Luo Tian moved again, rushing toward them with golden fists.

“You forced us to do this!” Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan exchanged glances, knowing if they didn’t use their secret techniques, they would be in dire straits.

“What does it matter if you forced us?” Golden fists swung, creating afterimages as they struck the two men.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sound filled the air. Though they dodged desperately, they still took several punches from Luo Tian, spitting blood and worsening their injuries.

“Seven Star Body Refinement!” As they were thrown thousands of feet away, the two men caught their breath and let out a low roar.

Black stars filled the sky with radiant light, shining upon their bodies. Their broken and mangled flesh began to heal rapidly, regenerating in an instant.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian stood under the starry sky, his brows furrowed slightly. He felt their techniques were similar to those of the Starry Domain people, all infused with starlight.

“What does it matter?” But Luo Tian immediately became a fierce warrior, attacking them again with the power of the Great Dao.

“Seven Star Swords!” Seeing Luo Tian attack again, they couldn’t hold back and roared toward the sky.

“Hum…” After their roar, waves of energy echoed in the sky. Two streaks of light instantly pierced through space and landed before them.

Two white long swords, radiating a misty aura, appeared in their hands. Luo Tian halted his movement, his eyes filled with caution.

The Seven Star Swords were possessed by each of the seven islands of the Seven Star Islands. When combined, they could form the Seven Star Sword Array, capable of annihilating early Epoch masters. It was one of the Seven Star Islands’ powerful secrets.

“They can actually use the Seven Star Swords!” Shen Gongfu abandoned his greedy expression, gazing at the two swords with concern. His eyes turned to Luo Tian.

“Despicable, using the Seven Star Swords!” The Third Island’s people looked at the two men holding the swords and cursed them, calling them shameless.

“Kid, if you had let us go earlier, there would have been no problem. Now it’s too late to regret!” Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan’s faces bore grotesque expressions as they addressed Luo Tian.

“If seven swords were combined, I might be cautious. But two Seven Star Swords aren’t worthy of harming me!” Luo Tian felt cautious but remained fearless, drawing his Wuya Sword and lightly tapping it, producing a resonant sound.

“Die! Seven Star Sword Array!” Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan spoke coldly, striking their swords with hand seals.

“Hum…” The two Seven Star Swords transformed into silver threads, swirling above their heads. The stars in the sky seemed to be stirred up, suddenly bursting with light and illuminating the entire Third Island. Starlight surged into the two swords at an incredible speed.

The two swords’ speed increased, eventually forming a starry sword net that descended upon Luo Tian. The net was filled with powerful sword energy, splitting the sky itself.

“Be careful!” Shen Gongfu warned, his gaze filled with concern as he prepared to rescue Luo Tian.

“Do you see? This is the famed Seven Star Sword Array of the Seven Star Islands. Though it only displayed two-tenths of its power, it can still finish you!” Sun Shaoyun spoke loudly, his voice filled with pride.

“Wuya Sword, Dao is boundless!” Luo Tian’s heart sank slightly as his Wuya Sword glowed with intense golden light. He swung it, cutting through the terrifying sword net.

The golden sword radiance surged forward without hesitation, as if it could cut through everything. Its overwhelming power collided with the sword net instantly.

“Hum…” In an instant, the golden radiance merged with the countless sword energies and vanished from sight.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, his face pale for a moment. A streak of blood trickled from his lips as he finally displayed shock. He had lost contact with the radiance after it entered the sword net, and his spiritual sense was also destroyed by the terrifying sword intent.

“Haha! It’s useless. Unless you are at the early Epoch stage, there is no chance. Surrender now; otherwise, this sword array will annihilate you!” Meng Xingyuan and Sun Shaoyun laughed loudly, addressing Luo Tian with smugness.

“Despicable! Using the Seven Star Swords!” The Third Island’s people looked with anger, thinking that without the swords, they would have been brutally beaten.

“I’ll see if this Seven Star Sword Array can harm me!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He didn’t retreat but advanced, his feet pushing off the ground as he rushed toward the sword array under the crowd’s shock.

“Shen Gongfu, this kid is seeking death; don’t blame us!” Seeing Luo Tian seek his own demise, Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan were surprised but quickly spoke to Shen Gongfu to shift blame.

“Hum…” As their words finished, Luo Tian’s body appeared within the formidable sword array, instantly engulfed by its overwhelming sword intent.

“Pain!” Luo Tian’s first sensation was pain. Though his flesh was invincible, these two Seven Star Swords were no ordinary items—they were relics of the Epoch Masters.

“One breath… Two breaths…” In an instant, Luo Tian was drenched in blood, the droplets falling from the sky.

“Is he dead?” The crowd could only see Luo Tian completely wrapped in sword energy, unaware of what happened. Their hearts sank as they watched the blood droplets falling, which had no divine essence and could not regenerate.

“Too forced,” Luo Tian stood within the sword array, enduring thousands of sword energies every moment. He sighed inwardly, thinking his flesh could withstand it.

“Not long enough to endure. The only way to break this incomplete array is to wait for it to vanish or use speed to escape. The second option is to use a technique stronger than this array to break it!” Luo Tian muttered, then began thinking.

“Sword intent, sword energy! Second Form: Sword is Boundless!” Luo Tian thought through it and quickly devised a way to counter this formidable array.

“Right, if these sword energies and intents aren’t used, it’s a waste! This will help me master the second form of Wuya Sword!” Luo Tian resisted the array while absorbing its incredible sword intent and energy.

“Strange, he’s still alive?” Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan furrowed their brows. They could feel Luo Tian was still alive.

“His flesh is strong; maybe he can endure a little longer. No need to worry. This Seven Star Sword Array won’t stop until it annihilates the opponent. Unless we exhaust our saintly power, but at this rate, we can endure an hour. Even a master of the early Epoch wouldn’t survive that long!” Meng Xingyuan’s face bore confidence, clearly confident in his saintly power.

“Is the Deputy Island Master dead?” A senior looked at Shen Gongfu, his face filled with concern.

“He’s not dead!” Shen Gongfu’s eyes tightened. He had just found such a Deputy Island Master, and he hadn’t fully utilized his value yet. If he died, Shen Gongfu would be reluctant.

“Don’t worry; a half-step Epoch won’t die in the Seven Star Islands. The elders will never let him perish!” Meng Xingyuan transmitted to Shen Gongfu.

“Rubbish, we all know that!” Shen Gongfu shouted back. He was心疼 because if Luo Tian truly died, who would fulfill the promises he had made?

Time passed slowly. Under the crowd’s shock, half an hour passed. Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan’s faces changed; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to endure so long.

“He still endures! What is his flesh made of?” Everyone was astonished, including Shen Gongfu. They all stared at Luo Tian within the Seven Star Sword Array, wrapped in countless sword energies.

“Even the蛮族’s flesh isn’t this strong!” Someone spoke, their voice filled with admiration. Some even thought Luo Tian’s flesh was stronger than the蛮族’s.

“Wuya Sword, Sword is Boundless!” As the crowd marveled at Luo Tian’s flesh, a low roar echoed from within the array. The people’s minds were startled.

“Hum…” Golden light spread, and countless golden lights transformed into sharp swords that flew out of the array.

The golden sword radiance instantly stung their eyes. Each streak of energy contained a great Dao power, clashing with the silver sword array instantly.

Chapter 1249: Threats

“Wuya Sword, Sword is Boundless!” Three thousand sword radiance streaks burst from the Seven Star Sword Array, continuously evolving. They split into two, then four, forming countless sword radiance streaks that clashed with the Seven Star Sword Array.

“Damn it, the array’s power is weakening!” Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan’s faces darkened, feeling the array seemed to face a formidable opponent, constantly being weakened.

“I said I would suppress you; you’re not worthy!” A low voice echoed within the array, and a streak of crimson light suddenly broke free, appearing before Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan.

“Wuya Sword! Dao is boundless!” To prevent them from pulling another trick, Luo Tian directly unleashed his ultimate technique.

The deathly sword radiance surged from the Wuya Sword in Luo Tian’s hand, combined with the Fan Tian Attack Technique. It became a deathly light sword that instantly descended upon them.

“Pf…” The golden radiance sliced through Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan like cutting tofu, splitting them in two. Blood spewed out, appearing before the crowd’s eyes.

“This…” The Third Island’s people were stunned, their faces filled with intense shock as they gazed at Luo Tian. To kill two half-step Epochs in one strike—what霸气 was this!

“Cough… Cough…” Luo Tian panted heavily, his body battered. His bones were even visible through his flesh, clearly showing the damage from the Seven Star Sword Array.

Great Dao power spread over Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan’s bodies, preventing their flesh from reuniting.

“Don’t escalate it!” Shen Gongfu recovered from his shock, watching Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan being constantly refined by the Great Dao power. Their energy weakened, so he quickly transmitted to Luo Tian.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded. He naturally knew the severity of the situation; if the two half-step Epochs died, he would likely be buried with them.

On his first day in the Seven Star Islands, Luo Tian had learned their rules: internal conflicts were allowed, but no one was to be killed. The human race had retreated to the Seven Star Islands under the watchful eyes of the蛮族. Every cultivator was precious, and no one could die in internal conflicts. The consequences would be severe—far worse than Luo Tian had imagined.

“Hum…” Seeing it was enough, Luo Tian pointed his hand, retrieving the Great Dao power. He gazed at the Seven Star Sword Array with a smile.

“Boom…” The two swords also flew out, plunging into the ground. Only their hilts remained visible.

“Come!” Luo Tian extended his hand, directly retrieving the two swords. His eyes held a smile.

“That’s our two islands’ Seven Star Swords!” At the same time, Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan’s bodies slowly coalesced. Seeing Luo Tian retrieve the swords, they spat blood. Though they were Grand Alchemists of their islands, if the Seven Star Swords were lost, they would have no face to remain on the island.

“Island Master, let’s tally our losses!” Luo Tian pointed his hand, and the Great Dao power transformed into two long dragons that bound everyone. He addressed Shen Gongfu.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Shen Gongfu’s eyes lit up. His small eyes were filled with yuanqi stones. His plump hands began to move constantly.

“Hmph, including principal and interest, it’s one billion two hundred million yuanqi stones!” Shen Gongfu rubbed his hands, looking at Luo Tian.

“Hmph, rounding it up to one billion five hundred million!” Luo Tian spoke carelessly.

“This…” The crowd heard their words, widening their eyes in shock. They hadn’t expected the Third Island’s losses to be so great. Luo Tian’s rounding method was also too shocking.

“I see!” However, someone soon understood. They looked at Shen Gongfu with a sense of helplessness, realizing he had definitely overcharged.

“Can Luo Tian have that many yuanqi stones?” The crowd then looked at Luo Tian, their eyes filled with shock. One billion five hundred million yuanqi stones—before, Luo Tian might have been able to produce them. But now, for Luo Tian, these yuanqi stones were an astronomical number.

“You two, winners and losers—produce your storage bags!” Luo Tian spoke without waiting for their agreement. He grabbed their storage bags, his powerful spiritual sense entering them. His face showed contempt.

“You’re poor! This is a Grand Alchemist?” Luo Tian sneered, speaking softly. Their storage bags had many yuanqi stones—combined they had over a million. There were also some herbs and elixirs, which could be sold for about two million. But compared to one billion five hundred million, it was still far too little.

“You two want the Seven Star Swords?” Luo Tian had a way. He had originally planned to detain them and have their island master pay for their release, but now with the Seven Star Swords, he didn’t need to detain them.

“Of course…” Their faces darkened. They hadn’t expected to lose both their wife and their fortune. They regretted deeply. Hu Jian’an had promised them a high-grade immortal elixir if they succeeded, but now not only did they get no elixir, but their wealth was also taken by Luo Tian. That wasn’t important; if they couldn’t retrieve the Seven Star Swords, their island masters would definitely skin them.

“Oh, we suffered losses; you should compensate us, right? After all, so many buildings and flowers were destroyed—those are all yuanqi stones!” Luo Tian smiled, golden light flashing on his flesh as he recovered from the severe injuries.

“Yes!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Shen Gongfu’s eyes lit up with admiration, looking at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have such an idea.

“This…” Sun Shaoyun and Meng Xingyuan’s faces darkened. Luo Tian’s words were clear even to two fools.

“One billion five hundred million yuanqi stones… that’s yuanqi stones! Even if you sold them, they wouldn’t be worth one billion five hundred million!” Their hearts felt like bleeding as they looked at Luo Tian and Shen Gongfu, their eyes filled with pleading.

“Go! Hurry up and gather the yuanqi stones. I can tell you, your island masters have a lot of wealth!” Shen Gongfu’s eyes gleamed with greed as he spoke.

“Want to continue?” Luo Tian looked at the two men’s gloomy faces, his eyes flashing coldly.

“When you’ve gathered the yuanqi stones, the Seven Star Swords will be returned to you!” Luo Tian patted their shoulders, his face smiling.

“Good, good…” Meng Xingyuan and Sun Shaoyun had no choice but to leave the Third Island in defeat.

“Ha… Ha…” Soon, the Third Island echoed with laughter. The disciples looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

His formidable strength, his unparalleled elixir skills—Luo Tian had now firmly established himself among the Third Island’s alchemists and disciples.

“Hu Jianhua!” Soon, Luo Tian spotted Hu Jianhua quietly squeezing out of the crowd. His face bore coldness as he moved, instantly appearing beside Hu Jianhua. He swung his hand and struck Hu Jianhua across the face.

“Colluding with others to assassinate the Deputy Island Master? Is that a death sentence?” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Hu Jianhua with killing intent.

Luo Tian truly had a death wish for the two brothers of the Hu family. If not for estimating the Seven Star Islands’ depth and his greatest goal—returning to the Nine Domains—he would have already killed them. Their endless troubles had driven Luo Tian to distraction.

“What do you want to do?” Hu Jianhua’s face was swollen from Luo Tian’s slap, his voice trembling. He truly feared Luo Tian now.

Luo Tian glanced at Shen Gongfu, seeing him subtly shake his head. Luo Tian’s eyes held a smile: “Deputy Grand Alchemist, our Third Island suffered severe damage. As the Deputy Grand Alchemist of the Third Island, shouldn’t you set an example? Just a token?”
