Luo Tian completed this, a formidable water dragon swept toward him and Tang Xinghuo. Each of them struck with a punch or a palm strike.

In the next moment, Luo Tian felt an immense force冲击 his body, causing him to recoil uncontrollably.

Plop plop... Luo Tian and Tang Xinghuo gazed in shock, colliding with the current.

Chapter 2433: Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats

The river churned violently, the force of time eroding. Instantly, Luo Tian and Tang Xinghuo transformed dramatically, roaring as they surged through the towering waves toward the rocks.

As they stood upon the rock, the time tree ceased its attack since Luo Tian had already retrieved the seed of the immortal elixir he had cultivated.

Luminous light scattered, and the time tree returned to its normal state, standing there with a broken branch that Tang Xinghuo had previously struck down.

"Strong," Luo Tian gazed at the time tree, thinking whether to take it away. However, he quickly abandoned the thought. Such rare treasures possessed sentience; reaching here was already fortunate. If he truly sought to subdue it, the tree would flee. It was better left here; perhaps next time he entered the Immortal Mountain, he might encounter a time fruit.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He then noticed the three-eyed dragon-headed fish drifting nearby.

"Without you, I wouldn't have reached here. Let me grant you a boon!" Luo Tian spoke softly, causing the three-eyed dragon-headed fish's eyes to gleam with joy.

"Yous..." As Luo Tian prepared to leave, two figures appeared. They fought fiercely as if wanting to devour each other. Upon seeing Luo Tian and Tang Xinghuo, they did not stop.

"Luo Tian!" They exclaimed in surprise, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Two more!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered with amusement as he stood there, gazing at the two still locked in combat.

"Master, let me handle them. Do you want them alive or dead?" Tang Xinghuo spoke, his gaze on the two. His heart hoped Luo Tian would say dead so no one would compete with him.

"You can only have one!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly. He felt the preciousness of the time fruit and did not wish to waste much more.

The two instantly understood their situation. Their fierce struggle intensified, resembling a street brawl with punches and kicks flying.

"Recognize them?" Luo Tian asked Tang Xinghuo, bored as he watched the two.

"Right now, I don't recognize them..." Tang Xinghuo, a wandering cultivator, could identify many fellow wanderers. However, these two were old men with faces so aged they had lost their features, leaving Tang Xinghuo unable to recognize them.

The two old men were ruthless and merciless, each determined to kill the other. In life or death, they cared little for anything else.

"Ah..." Finally, one old man bit through the other's neck, his face smeared with blood as he collapsed to the ground, panting heavily.

"I... I..." The old man stammered but could not speak.

"I kept my word!" Luo Tian strode toward the old man, retrieving a time fruit and placing it in his mouth. He also used the Soul-Rooting Demon Technique to bind the old man's cultivation.

After consuming the time fruit, the old man's complexion improved. Though his injuries remained, his energy surged, and his cultivation revived.

"Ugh..." The old man panted, circulating his energy to recover his injuries. These wounds were simple for a Supreme King cultivator.

"Supreme King mid-stage?" Luo Tian and Tang Xinghuo exchanged glances, their expressions slightly changed. However, Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with amusement while Tang Xinghuo's showed caution, sensing his position in Luo Tian's eyes was under threat.

"Yin Yitian!" Tang Xinghuo recognized the old man, exclaiming in surprise.

"Killer of Life Elder Yin Yitian?" Luo Tian heard Tang Xinghuo's words, his own expression slightly stunned.

Luo Tian had once managed intelligence in the Heaven-Plugging Mountain and knew some of the wandering cultivators from the Upper Three Heavens. Among them was Killer of Life Elder Yin Yitian.

Cruel and treacherous, this was the description of Killer of Life Elder Yin Yitian. However, his Supreme King mid-stage cultivation allowed him to act as he pleased.

"Master, this Killer of Life Elder is hard to control!" Tang Xinghuo spoke to Luo Tian, his gaze serious. Everyone knew of Killer of Life Elder's infamous reputation.

"Chen Xinghuo, you seek death!" The old man's face turned cold, his gaze on Tang Xinghuo filled with murderous intent. Luo Tian had placed a restriction within him, but Tang Xinghuo hadn't. He didn't suggest eliminating Tang Xinghuo.

"Enough, regardless of your past, from today on, you are my subordinate. Understood?" Luo Tian spoke. A Supreme King mid-stage cultivator was quite a gain for Luo Tian.

"Yes!" Yin Yitian nodded, his disheveled white hair scattered. He wasn't one for much talking, standing behind Luo Tian.

"Let's go. So long no one has come here, it must be that no one could reach this point!" Luo Tian didn't care about Yin Yitian's past, now he had to listen to him.

The three mounted the three-eyed dragon-headed fish and drifted into the dark cave.

Darkness enveloped them, even with their sharp spiritual senses, they couldn't see what lay around the cave. They were cautious, for this was the Immortal Mountain, where strange occurrences could happen. Just entering the Immortal Mountain and drawing time had given them a lesson.

"Ah?" Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian stood behind Luo Tian, suddenly Tang Tian's eyes flickered.

"Someone!" Almost instantly, Tang Xinghuo exclaimed, gazing ahead.

"Where?" Luo Tian turned sharply, his eyes filled with surprise.

"I... I saw a figure behind you, its face grotesque, as if wanting to devour you!" Tang Xinghuo spoke tremblingly.

"But it vanished instantly!" Tang Xinghuo added, causing Luo Tian and Yin Yitian's eyes to flicker with confusion.

"Why didn't I see it?" Yin Yitian looked at Tang Xinghuo, disbelief in his eyes. His cultivation was higher than Tang Xinghuo and Luo Tian; if Tang Xinghuo could see it, how could he not?

"Did I hallucinate?" Hearing Yin Yitian's words, Tang Xinghuo also became uncertain.

"A Supreme King cultivator would not hallucinate!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing something unclean.

Yet, what was Luo Tian's identity? A disciple of the Ghost Valley and a Soul-Controlling Master. Even if there were unclean things, they would fear him. Moreover, Luo Tian hadn't sensed any ghosts or spirits nearby.

"Unless the opponent's strength was far beyond mine..." Luo Tian broke out in cold sweat, thinking it truly possible. After all, this was the Immortal Mountain; even a fallen Supreme King's body had been controlled.

"Look again carefully. Tell me if you see it!" Luo Tian instructed Tang Xinghuo, also raising the Ghost-Controlling Seal in case of emergencies.

The three fell into silence again. Only the sound of the three-eyed dragon-headed fish splashing water could be heard. After an hour, Tang Xinghuo still hadn't seen the grotesque figure.

"Gurgle..." As Luo Tian and the others watched carefully, a low call echoed through the cave.

"What is that?" Upon hearing this sound, they cautiously looked around. The three-eyed dragon-headed fish also stopped moving, its three eyes swirling.

"Wa..." A sound like a baby's cry echoed from the distance. Red light rose from the cave's ceiling.

As the red light rose, Luo Tian and the others saw what it was. Their skin prickled.

Both were Supreme Kings; such a reaction was rare.

On the cave's ceiling, countless creatures with infant faces and bat bodies hung upside down. The red light came from the infants' eyes, reflecting on their wings, making them appear blood-red.

"Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats!" Luo Tian didn't exclaim but transmitted to Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian, telling them not to move.

Luo Tian had read about Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. They were a terrifying clan; a Supreme King late-stage could be drained of blood within minutes.

The next stretch of the path was nearly filled with Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats, at least millions. This was what Luo Tian could see.

"Supreme King domain is useless; they can even absorb domain power!" Luo Tian explained to Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, causing their faces to show grim smiles.

"Indeed, this is the Immortal Mountain. We can only go in; now we can't leave because the terrain constantly changes!" Yin Yitian transmitted to Luo Tian, not making a sound.

"Ah..." As Yin Yitian's words finished, a piercing buzz echoed through the cave.

With this sound, all the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats instantly seemed awakened, crying out.

The piercing sound made Luo Tian and the others extremely uncomfortable. A terrifying wave affected them, even with their domain up, it still penetrated.

"Sound technique! This is one of the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats' attack methods!" Luo Tian transmitted, beginning to fiercely resist the overwhelming wave.

"Rustle..." As they resisted, red light flew down from above toward Luo Tian and the others. Cold fangs appeared at the infants' mouths, looking terrifying.

"Jump in! These bats fear water and fire!" Luo Tian shouted, knowing they were exposed. He immediately ordered the two to jump in, leaping into the stream and retrieving the three-eyed dragon-headed fish.

Without needing to speak, Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo didn't lag behind Luo Tian.

Chapter 2434: Skeleton Army

The three plunged into the water, sinking rapidly. They were surprised to find this water could isolate their aura, making the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats unable to locate them.

"Ah..." Another piercing cry echoed, and the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats cried out again.

"My god..." Tang Xinghuo shouted. The sound was even more powerful in the water, making all three struggle to endure.

Blood flowed from their orifices, forcing them deeper into the water to weaken the attack.

Ten zhang... hundred zhang...

After sinking several hundred zhang, Luo Tian and the others felt slightly better. However, the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats seemed to have found their location, circling above with red eyes.

They continued sinking for thousands of zhang until they nearly reached the bottom. They saw the scene below, their pupils contracting.

The bottom wasn't rocks or sand but entirely made of bones stretching endlessly.

"Who died here?" Luo Tian and the others, having experienced many hardships, stood on the pile of bones with admiration. Among the bones were weapons, but they had rotted; some shattered upon contact.

"Where did these bones come from?" Luo Tian frowned, puzzled. He hadn't heard of any sect attacking the Immortal Mountain.

"Crack..." As they pondered, the bones covered in river water emitted a series of crackling sounds. Clusters of green light flickered within the skull heads, gradually gathering together.

In an instant, skeletons formed, holding broken weapons. However, Luo Tian sensed a terrifying battle spirit rising from these skeletons.

"Will! Unyielding!" A thunderous roar echoed in Luo Tian's ears. The skeletons rushed toward the three.

Though these skeletons appeared strong, their strength wasn't remarkable. Luo Tian and the others weren't afraid of them, but they were cautious about that terrifying battle spirit.

A rusted sword instantly slashed toward Luo Tian's front, but before reaching him, it was shattered by his aura.

"Rustle..." They didn't dare leave the water but walked along the river of bones, following the current.

Bones scattered; no matter how the skeletons attacked, they were constantly shattered by the three. However, over time, the skeletons' strength increased and their numbers thinned.

"Now it's true-stage bones. Will we meet a King-level one later?" Tang Xinghuo transmitted to Luo Tian, his gaze filled with caution.

That will was too astonishing. Even after years, it still existed. These people must have been extremely devoted; they were undoubtedly top-tier armies of the immortal realm.

They walked ten thousand zhang, and the bones kept breaking and reforming. Guided by a will, they continuously attacked Luo Tian and others.

"Is it guarding something?" Luo Tian frowned. The presence of such will must be protecting their beliefs, like the ancient Heaven Yuan War Soul. Though it had become a residual soul, it still wanted to protect the Heaven Yuan continent.

After walking another ten thousand zhang, the bones beneath their feet thinned. Behind them followed tens of thousands of skeleton armies, constantly attacking Luo Tian and others.

"Supreme King-level bones!" Though sparse, these bones grew stronger. Finally, Luo Tian saw a Supreme King-level bone.

Eight golden bones formed, exuding immense power. Even Luo Tian felt a chill at the strength on them.

"Why are these people's bodies missing? Is it because of too much time?" Luo Tian pondered.

"Crack..." Eight skeletons held eight weapons, rushing toward Luo Tian and the others.

"Buzz..." A golden sword cut through the water, instantly arriving before Luo Tian. His face slightly changed.

"Crash..."

In the next moment, Luo Tian summoned his Dragon Valley Sword, clashing with the golden sword. He took two steps back, and the golden skeleton also retreated but rushed forward again.

The aura was overwhelming. Eight golden skeletons attacked Luo Tian and the others, while the skeleton army behind also continuously attacked them.

"Very strong skeletons!"

"I understand now. They fused their former cultivation and bodies into their bones!" Luo Tian instantly realized, his eyes filled with awe.

"We must break through! These few skeletons are变态 strong. Two of them were Supreme King mid-stage!" Luo Tian was shocked, and Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian also attacked the skeletons.

Eight skeletons lacked cultivation but possessed golden bones and overwhelming battle spirit, causing the two much trouble. Especially those two holding war axes were Supreme King mid-stage skeletons; they swung their axes, each strike making Yin Yitian spit blood.

"We can't break through. Do we have to return to the surface and face those Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats?" Tang Xinghuo shouted, being attacked by three Supreme King early-stage skeletons and in a desperate situation.

"I feel these bones are guarding something. There must be treasure!" Luo Tian fought continuously, speculating that the more dangerous the situation, the greater the opportunity.

Above were Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats; below were these bones. They could only push forward.

"Go up!" Luo Tian transmitted to the two, clashing with a Supreme King early-stage skeleton. He shattered many bones beneath his feet and rushed toward the surface.

Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats feared water and fire. Now they couldn't go underwater, but he had fire—Xiao Qi's flame could definitely crush those infant-faced bats.

Luo Tian was in charge. Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian would rather face those bats than these skeletons.

They moved swiftly, not lingering in battle. They rushed toward the surface, while the skeleton army followed closely behind.

Breaking through the water's surface, they saw a dense mass of Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats.

As they appeared, the swarms of bats instantly screeched and rushed toward Luo Tian and the others. Their cold fangs made Luo Tian and the others shudder.

Nine-color flames enveloped them instantly. However, a group of bats rushed through the flame before reaching Luo Tian and the others.

Cold fangs bit into Luo Tian's flesh, causing his mind to tremble. He hadn't expected even his body couldn't withstand those fangs.

"Go..." Luo Tian roared, shaking his body. A furious aura burst out, instantly shattering those Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats.

Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian also shook their bodies. A mass of bat corpses fell from their bodies into the nine-color flames, turning to ashes.

Although the bats were killed by the three, their fangs remained on their bodies.

"One moment, I felt my cultivation was taken by one-tenth!" Tang Xinghuo spoke with lingering fear, pulling out each fang from his body and standing in the nine-color flames.

The water seemed like a barrier. Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats couldn't descend, and the skeletons didn't come out of the water.

"Go!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He controlled the flames, leading them deeper in hopes of shaking off these things.

One by one, Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats followed Luo Tian and the others. The skeleton army also stayed in the water, constantly chasing them.

After flying a few hundred zhang, they suddenly stopped. A colossal creature appeared in their line of sight.

"Playing too rough!" Luo Tian cursed, looking at the colossal creature blocking their path. A massive Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bat hung before them, its sharp claws and nearly arm-thick fangs. Even the wings had barbs. Luo Tian didn't doubt this creature's claws could tear him apart.

"Boom..." As it spoke, the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bat opened its eyes. Crimson eyes glowed coldly, and it flapped its wings slightly.

The river churned violently. Windstorms formed into whirlwinds, sweeping toward Luo Tian and the others. Even Luo Tian could see lightning rising within those whirlwinds.

The nine-color flames became unstable before they reached them. The Blood-Winged Bats chasing them also stopped, emitting screeches.

"Push through! We must push through!" Luo Tian and the others looked anxious.

Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, black ghost claws appearing instantly. He reached toward the colossal whirlwind. Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo also launched their martial arts.

"Boom... Boom..." Three explosions. The colossal storm exploded instantly, turning into raindrops falling from the sky.

"Go..." Luo Tian shouted. This was their best chance to escape. Using Yellow Spring Steps combined with earth-moving techniques, he rushed ahead at a terrifying speed into the broken storm.

"Ah..." A screeching sound came from the massive Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bat. An invisible wave surged again.

"Roar..." Luo Tian roared, a dragon's roar sound technique. He also used the sound technique to counteract that wave capable of destroying him.

With Luo Tian's sound technique, the power lessened slightly. However, it still made them spit blood.

"This is the hardest part!" Luo Tian looked at the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bat King hanging before them. He slowly released his claws, reaching toward them.

Chapter 2435: Demon Cloud Wings

"Buzz..."

The wide wings emitted a cold glow, instantly cutting through space and slicing toward Luo Tian and the others.

"Make way!" Luo Tian roared, dodging the shoulder strike. He punched forward with Wind-Blowing Fury, striking the seemingly thin wings.

Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian also attacked. Yin Yitian's hands formed seals, inscribing runes on his body. A thunderous sound echoed as he directly collided with the wings.

Tang Xinghuo's hands glowed again, gathering into a single point on his finger. He suddenly erupted, pressing the wing with one finger.

"Boom..." A闷 sound echoed. Luo Tian spat blood, and Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo's bodies also cracked.

"Growl..." A hoarse voice came from the Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bat King. Its massive body was also shaken by the three.

"Go..." The three stepped on the waves, rushing deeper again.

In an instant, they surpassed the Blood-Winged Bat King. Their speed was astonishing. The Blood-Winged Bat King screeched, flapping its wings and flying after Luo Tian and the others.

"How come this big creature is so fast!" The three felt anxious. They didn't want to confront the Blood-Winged Bat King directly. Their single attack had already shown they could only defeat it by uniting.

However, even if they could kill this thing, the cost would be unbearable. They would definitely suffer heavy injuries.

Hundred zhang... ten thousand zhang...

In an instant, the three broke through ten thousand zhang and finally saw a glimmer of light. Their hearts trembled.

"Exit!" Luo Tian exclaimed, his speed increasing again. As he spoke, he rushed toward the light.

"A barrier..." Before reaching the exit, Yin Yitian saw a barrier with strange runes flowing on its golden surface.

The barrier didn't look thick, but it gave them an insurmountable feeling. Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo's faces darkened.

"Who set this? How could there be such things?"

"The black and white wings are a barrier set by the Fallen Supreme King!" In an instant, as they approached the barrier, they saw its markings.

"Is this playing with us?" Tang Xinghuo cursed. He felt the overwhelming energy behind him, trembling. The barrier set by the Heaven-Plugging Supreme King was impossible for them to pass.

"You two, don't resist. I'll take you through!" Luo Tian, flying ahead, transmitted to the two and immediately retrieved them.

Hundred zhang... ten zhang...

In an instant, Luo Tian reached the barrier. Without hesitation, he rushed toward the golden barrier.

"Buzz..." The next moment, a smile appeared on Luo Tian's face. This barrier that could block Supreme Kings had no effect on him at all.

"Master Guiguo, you truly didn't deceive me!" Luo Tian rushed through the barrier. His eyes glowed with excitement. The earth-moving technique was indeed very practical.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian passed through the barrier, the Blood-Winged Bat King collided with it. It was instantly repelled by the barrier, emitting a painful screech. Many Blood-Winged Infant-Faced Bats were also shattered by the Bat King.

The skeletons stopped, apparently unable to deal with the barrier. Their battle spirit faded, returning to calm.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian waved his hand, releasing Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo. He panted heavily. Their eyes were filled with disbelief, not expecting Luo Tian to pass through the barrier without being affected.

"Master, you are truly amazing. I'm getting more and more respectful of you. My admiration for you is like the endless ocean, flowing endlessly..." Tang Xinghuo immediately started praising Luo Tian.

"Enough..." Luo Tian smiled lightly, gazing at Tang Xinghuo. He hadn't expected Tang Xinghuo to have this side.

"He's smiling, so praising works!" Tang Xinghuo's eyes flickered with light. This was his secret technique. Seeing Luo Tian's smile, he couldn't help but look at Yin Yitian with a hint of pride and炫耀.

"Where are we?" Yin Yitian ignored Tang Xinghuo's proud gaze, looking around.

At this moment, the three were in a large hall. The entrance was the previous barrier. The hall was vast, with green flames flickering around its edges. In the center of the hall stood an altar, on which a black wing floated, emitting powerful energy.

"What is this..." Seeing the black wing, Luo Tian and the others' bodies trembled.

"Fallen Supreme King's wings!" The three instantly recognized what it was, their eyes filled with disbelief.

The black wing before them was identical to the pair of wings the Fallen Supreme King had when he appeared.

"Did this place become the Fallen Supreme King's inheritance?" Yin Yitian's eyes glowed with joy. He hadn't expected them to find the Fallen Supreme King's inheritance so quickly.

"It is said that the Fallen Supreme King's two wings are treasures. They were obtained by the Fallen Supreme King when he entered the Immortal Mountain and killed a beast named Demon Thunder Phoenix, then refined them!" Yin Yitian spoke, his eyes filled with greed. However, he didn't move because they no longer had the right to compete with Luo Tian.

"Demons' Cloud Wings?" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He naturally knew the origin of the wings and more importantly, that this pair was called the Demon Cloud Wings.

"Who took down the Fallen Supreme King's Demon Cloud Wings? Why was the Fallen Supreme King seen with these wings?" Tang Xinghuo asked, gazing at the floating black wing.

"This is only half. Where is the other half?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows.

"An inheritance, I guess the Fallen Supreme King himself took these Demon Cloud Wings and placed them in the inheritance. After all, the Fallen Supreme King was a peak powerhouse. Though he came to the Immortal Mountain in his later years, his energy had withered, but still a powerhouse!" Yin Yitian spoke, gazing at the black wing with reverence.

"Master, these wings are suitable for you to collect. They will definitely elevate your strength by a level!" Tang Xinghuo spoke, knowing these wings weren't for him to collect.

"Rest assured, I'll collect this Demon Cloud Wings and won't let you two down!" Luo Tian spoke softly. Naturally, he wouldn't let Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian go empty-handed. The Soul-Rooting Demon Technique was merely a method to bind them, but making them genuinely help him and protect the Heaven Yuan Sect was Luo Tian's true intention. Therefore, he would give them appropriate benefits.

However, these Demon Cloud Wings wouldn't be given to the two because they were treasures of the Heaven Dao Sect, and Luo Tian needed them.

"Guard me. I'll collect it!" Luo Tian spoke softly, taking a step toward the altar.

"Another one appeared!" As Luo Tian took a step forward, Tang Xinghuo's face showed alarm. He pointed at the back of Luo Tian.

This time, even Yin Yitian's face changed because he also saw it.

Luo Tian turned around sharply, gazing at his back but still saw nothing. Only the alarmed gazes of Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo remained.

"What is it?" Luo Tian also broke out in cold sweat. Anyone knowing something unseen following them would feel uneasy.

"It's gone again!"

"What is this thing? It's so powerful. Or maybe it has been following us all along, only revealing itself when it attacks!" Yin Yitian felt the severity of the situation. He hadn't believed before, but now he was fully convinced.

Purple lightning flashed as Luo Tian activated his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes. However, he still couldn't see anything following him.

"If Sun Kelian were here, with his Celestial Eye he might be able to see!" Luo Tian sighed deeply.

"Watch my back. If it appears, you must tell me immediately!" Luo Tian instructed the two. This was about his life; he couldn't be careless.

"Yes!" Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo nodded, tightly watching Luo Tian. They were also afraid something would happen to him.

"If it doesn't appear, then it must fear me or something on my body!" Luo Tian muttered quietly. He took another step toward the altar with the floating Demon Cloud Wings.

As Luo Tian approached, the Demon Cloud Wings emitted waves. A gust of wind rose in the hall, a powerful resistance blocking Luo Tian's body.

"I am a disciple of the Heaven Dao Sect. The Fallen Supreme King, you shouldn't be too harsh on me!" Luo Tian thought to himself but was extremely tense. He pressed forward under the powerful pressure, approaching the altar.

Luo Tian soon reached beneath the altar. He stepped on the ground and leapt onto the altar. As he landed, his face changed abruptly.

"Buzz..." At the moment Luo Tian stepped onto the altar, a phoenix-like cry echoed in his ears. A series of powerful sword qi instantly rose from the Demon Cloud Wings, rushing toward Luo Tian.

The sword intent was overwhelming, as if it could split the heavens. Each sword qi was invisible, making Luo Tian's eyes filled with seriousness. His Dragon Valley Sword roared into existence in his hand, continuously moving.

"Receive ten thousand eight hundred sword qi!" A solemn voice echoed on the altar. A series of sword qi followed, attacking.

The sound of collision immediately rang out. Luo Tian's vast spiritual awareness spread, continuously capturing the sword qi that filled the altar.

"Ten thousand eight hundred sword qi!" Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo couldn't help but gasp in awe.

Chapter 2436: The Third Level of the Sword Path

On the altar, a black wing floated. Sword qi was everywhere. Luo Tian held his Dragon Valley Sword and continuously swung it, sending out powerful sword qi that exploded before him.

Although Luo Tian's movements with the Dragon Valley Sword were fast, the sword qi came from all directions. Even with his strength, he couldn't fully block them. Fortunately, his body was strong; the sword qi cutting into him wasn't fatal but left him in a desperate situation, gradually accumulating many wounds.

"Legend has it that the Fallen Supreme King's sword path was at its peak. This ten thousand eight hundred sword qi must not be easy to receive!" Yin Yitian spoke, watching Luo Tian who was already battling the sword qi.

"Yes, in just a short while, the master has received hundreds of swords and is already like this. What about the rest? Who can withstand it?" Tang Xinghuo's gaze was filled with concern, watching Luo Tian who was covered in blood.

"Crack crack..." Luo Tian continuously moved his Dragon Valley Sword, dodging and moving. He had pushed the Yellow Spring Steps to its limit but still couldn't fully avoid the sword qi.

As his injuries grew worse, Luo Tian's speed slowed. This vicious cycle would eventually make him unable to endure. He might even be struck in a vital spot, leading to his death.

"Master, should I help you?" Tang Xinghuo shouted. If he went up, the sword qi might attack him.

"No need. It's useless. There are too many sword qi!" Luo Tian replied, but he was thinking about how to withstand them.

"Fallen Supreme King Elder, I am one of your people!" Luo Tian sighed in his heart. He was struck by two sword qi on his shoulders, blood flowing from the wounds.

"Sword intent!" Suddenly, Luo Tian felt a wave on his shoulders. He hadn't noticed it before, but as time passed, he became more tense and finally felt that wave. This wave was from the sword qi's intent. He didn't understand this sword intent, even feeling that only the Sword King Du Jianhang from the highest sword path could comprehend it.

"Breakthrough! I must break through the third level of the sword path!" Luo Tian instantly thought of a way to solve it.

"The Fallen Supreme King's sword path must not be inferior to Du Jianhang's master. These sword qi are the perfect opportunity for me to understand the sword intent!" Luo Tian thought, continuously resisting while beginning to comprehend the sword qi cutting him.

Time passed slowly. The more sword wounds Luo Tian had, the more anxious Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo became.

Luo Tian's eyes were increasingly excited, as his perception and insight had reached their peak under this tense state. He actually understood some things.

However, this was just the beginning. Luo Tian had too many questions; these needed to be understood by enduring two more sword qi.

"What is 'no self, no sword'? What does 'no' mean? What does it mean to have no self?" Luo Tian pondered, his eyes gradually becoming confused.
