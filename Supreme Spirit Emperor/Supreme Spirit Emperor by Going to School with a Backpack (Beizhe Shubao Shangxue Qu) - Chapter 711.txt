The Yellow River surged, and the Yellow River Soldiers reappeared—but instead of attacking Luo Tian's group, they stood in formation behind them.

"Come on!" Diao Dezhu saw two Yellow River Soldiers at the Immortal King Peak level, yet they did not attack. He realized it was due to the Yellow River's influence; these soldiers would not harm them. His courage grew, and he taunted Yang Huanyu's group.

"Come over, are you afraid of us?" Jin Wuye sneered, transforming into a black cloud and charging toward the Yellow River.

"Pull me back!" Diao Dezhu saw Jin Wuye rushing forward and his body convulsed unnaturally. He took a step toward Jin Wuye while spreading his hands, sending a mental transmission to Luo Tian's group.

"At this moment, you still want to show off!" Sun Keming and Sima Tuo cursed, ignoring Diao Dezhu and watching Jin Wuye enter the Yellow River Pool.

"Y-You..." Diao Dezhu's face showed embarrassment as he took two steps forward in an awkward posture, arms raised in the air, feet stepping on Yellow River water before flying back.

In that moment, Jin Wuye had already plunged into the Yellow River. His aura shattered countless Yellow River Soldiers, and the surrounding Yellow River water burst outward toward Diao Dezhu.

Roar...

As Jin Wuye entered, two Yellow River Soldiers at the Immortal King Peak level roared, wielding divine swords and slashing toward Jin Wuye.

A yellow sword beam, immense enough to shake the heavens, instantly cut through the black cloud, slicing toward Jin Wuye.

Jin Wuye's eyes darkened; his hands moved swiftly, and the shattered seal-character black cloud instantly transformed. The seals coalesced before Jin Wuye, forming a seal-character shield that blocked his path.

Crack...

In an instant, two sharp sounds rose before Jin Wuye, and the black seal-character shattered into swirling black mist. Jin Wuye's body was also sent flying backward.

"Indeed, the Yellow River Soldiers at the Immortal King Peak level are formidable!" Jin Wuye wiped blood from his lips, reformed the black cloud, and took another step toward the Yellow River Pool. His aura grew even more ferocious; the black cloud transformed into a monstrous beast, wrapping around his body and continuously roaring.

"Let's go!" But as Jin Wuye just stepped into the Yellow River, Yang Huanyu spoke, his gaze fixed on the several Palace Princes and the Immortal King Late-stage masters.

Yang Huanyu's words made Jin Wuye pause, his gaze shifting to Yang Huanyu: "This is the perfect time to eliminate them!"

Roar...

In an instant, a harrowing roar echoed. The black beast surrounding Jin Wuye roared and shattered before him, and sweat streamed down Jin Wuye's forehead.

"Since when did you need to decide for me?" Yang Huanyu's icy gaze met Jin Wuye's, while the other masters ignored the scene, gathering the Palace Princes and Immortal King Late-stage masters.

"Yes, I am guilty!" Jin Wuye showed no resentment and bowed respectfully before Yang Huanyu.

Jin Wuye and Yang Huanyu left Luo Tian's group stunned, watching the cold-eyed Yang Huanyu. They could not fathom what reason made these defiant masters obey Yang Huanyu's orders so obediently.

"Go..." Yang Huanyu glanced at Luo Tian, then took a step toward the exit, leading away the Palace Princes and Immortal King Late-stage masters.

In the empty space, only Luo Tian's five remained, exchanging glances, unsure of Yang Huanyu's next move.

"You have one hour; leave within an hour. I must vanish, or it will always be a problem," the Yellow River's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Understood, but there is a rogue emperor's soul—please deal with it; otherwise, it will become a major disaster!" Luo Tian responded to the Yellow River.

"There's none left; he has already left, taken by that group..." The Yellow River replied, causing Luo Tian's face to twist.

"So much remains unspoken; I can't explain now. When the time comes, everything will be revealed," the Yellow River's voice echoed again before falling silent.

"First, we must obtain the Yellow River Ruler!" Despite his many doubts, Luo Tian could not ask further since the Yellow River did not wish to explain. He leaped down, plunging into the Yellow River beneath the coffin, searching for what the Yellow River called the "Yellow River Ruler."

Chapter 2679: The Yellow River Ruler ()

"This kid must have something good!" Zhang Chenglong saw Luo Tian rush into the Yellow River, his eyes flickering with excitement. He rushed into the Yellow River water as well.

"Damn it, I didn't get anything—can't let this kid have all the fun!" Sun Keming and Sima Tuo shouted, leaping into the Yellow River.

The group all rushed toward the depths of the Yellow River Pool, plunging over a hundred feet to reach the bottom. They saw waves of yellow light.

A three-foot-long small ruler lay quietly at the pool's bottom, radiating a profound aura—it was clearly a treasure.

"This must be the Yellow River Ruler!" Sun Keming, Sima Tuo, Zhang Chenglong, and Diao Dezhu's eyes gleamed as they rushed toward the yellow ruler.

However, a yellow barrier rose, unusually hard and invisible within the Yellow River.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang...

Four resonant sounds echoed, and Sun Keming's group froze in place. Each of their heads bore a large bump.

"Damn it, what is this thing!" Sun Keming cursed, tapping the barrier with his hand. Though there was Yellow River water, the sound remained clear and crisp.

"Excuse me, I'll go in first!" Luo Tian laughed, leaping into the barrier without hindrance and landing before the Yellow River Ruler.

Buzz...

The yellow divine light flickered, and the Yellow River Ruler emitted waves of resistance, seemingly resisting Luo Tian, pressing a powerful pressure upon him.

"This test is unnecessary, isn't it?" Luo Tian spoke softly and continued walking toward the Yellow River Pool.

Yet Diao Dezhu's group could only watch as Luo Tian approached the Yellow River Ruler.

The heavy footsteps echoed in Luo Tian's ears, and his eyes focused solely on the Yellow River Ruler. After an hour, he reached it, sweat dripping from his forehead.

Luo Tian extended a finger, and a drop of blood flew from it, landing on the Yellow River Ruler.

The blood seeped into the ruler, and it emitted a deep hum of discontent.

"A spirit within?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed, sensing the ruler's will and a hint of amusement. He extended his hand again.

This time, it was a drop of refined blood, imprinted onto the Yellow River Ruler. Upon absorbing the blood, the ruler's divine light surged violently, blindingly bright—so intense that even Luo Tian could not withstand it and instinctively closed his eyes.

"Too blinding!" Zhang Chenglong's group also closed their eyes, shocked by the golden light.

Roar...

All the Yellow River Soldiers in the pool roared, including the two at the Immortal King Peak level. They transformed into a torrent of Yellow River water, plunging into the pool.

Luo Tian's vision was filled with golden light, but he felt a wave of energy sweeping the entire Yellow River Pool. The sound of waves echoed in his ears.

The Yellow River reversed, and within the golden light, the Yellow River Ruler emitted a powerful suction, fiercely absorbing the Yellow River water from the pool.

One hour... half a day.

Exactly an hour passed, and the entire Yellow River Pool's water had completely dried up, with the dazzling divine light also vanishing.

Boom...

A heavy explosion echoed in Luo Tian's group's ears, and their vision returned to normal. Luo Tian felt his hand heat up; looking down, the three-foot-long Yellow River Ruler lay in his grasp.

At the same time, Luo Tian's mind received many images—these were all about the Yellow River Ruler.

Luo Tian's spirit trembled, his eyes filled with joy as he laughed loudly, gazing at the Yellow River Ruler in his hand.

"The Yellow River Pool is the Yellow River Ruler; when transformed into a Yellow River Pool, it possesses millions of Yellow River Soldiers!" Luo Tian whispered, his words reaching Diao Dezhu's group.

"Too变态 (too extreme)!" Diao Dezhu exclaimed in disbelief, gazing at the Yellow River Ruler in Luo Tian's hand.

"So does that mean Luo Tian now has two Immortal King Peak-level Yellow River Soldiers, several Immortal King Late-stage Yellow River Soldiers, and many True Immortal-level Yellow River Soldiers?" Sun Keming's voice trembled as he looked at Luo Tian.

"This time, we really made a big gain!" Luo Tian spoke, his voice filled with strong joy. What did the Tianyuan Sect lack? An Immortal King Peak-level master. Now, Luo Tian had two of them. Though they were far inferior to strong figures like the Black and White Officials, the entire Yellow River Pool could certainly withstand an Immortal King Peak-level master.

"Now, our Tianyuan Sect fears no阎罗殿 (Yama Palace) or any仙山 (immortal mountain)!" Luo Tian spoke, tightly gripping the Yellow River Ruler.

"Go!" Luo Tian gazed deeply at the massive Yellow River Coffin, then spoke to Diao Dezhu's group and flew toward the exit.

As Luo Tian's group left, the space fell silent again. Waves of energy emanated from the Yellow River Coffin, and a destructive aura erupted, shaking heaven and earth. The void collapsed.

At the same time, everyone in the Yellow River Tomb felt a strong repulsion, pushing them from their positions.

The roar echoed; the ancestral god mountain began to collapse in large sections, with deep ravines appearing on the ground. Massive mountains sank into the earth.

The sky roared, and figures descended from the heavens, falling onto the ground in a chaotic manner.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

It seemed like rain, appearing beneath the dark sky, eyes filled with confusion.

"What's happening?" People first looked bewildered, then gazed at the now-vanished ancestral god mountain, their eyes filled with bitterness.

"The Yellow River Tomb is gone!" People sighed, pondering for a moment before understanding.

Figures moved swiftly; a group of fierce figures appeared—those who had left before Luo Tian's group.

Nine people, upon appearing, immediately drew attention due to their overwhelming auras.

Yang Huanyu coldly glanced at the crowd before leading eight others away from the spot.

"Who are these people? Their auras are so strong!" The crowd murmured until the nine left, allowing them to finally breathe.

"Out!" As the crowd murmured, Luo Tian's group also appeared, drawing attention.

"Let's go back to the Tianyuan Sect; hell is about to change!" Luo Tian whispered, flying into the sky with Xiang Tianming and others under the people's watchful eyes. He also sent a message to Chen Zhanbiao, heading toward the Zhou Guiwang City.

As Luo Tian's group left, the black sky gradually stabilized. People stared at each other with joy in their eyes because they had gained much within the great tomb, elevating their status.

"Wait... I feel like something is missing?" A young man spoke, his eyes filled with confusion.

"Palace Prince, the Ten Palace Princes... where are they?" The next moment, people cried out in alarm, all eyes wide open.

Chapter 2680: Ten Palace Anger ()

"Did they all perish in the Yellow River Tomb?" People panicked, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Quickly, something big is about to happen!" The next moment, those who had entered the Yellow River Tomb rushed in all directions.

The Ten Palace Princes and the Immortal King Late-stage masters had vanished, an event no Yama Palace could ignore. They would definitely investigate, even if it was unrelated to them; they would lose a layer of skin.

The ancestral god mountain instantly calmed, as if nothing had happened in the entire world.

Time flowed slowly; seven days passed, and Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming's group returned to Zhou Guiwang City, meeting up with Chen Zhanbiao and Xu Liyi earlier.

"Thank goodness you're back!" Seeing Luo Tian's group return, the Zhou Guiwang Lord finally sighed in relief. His eyes widened with disbelief upon seeing Luo Tian had advanced to the Immortal King Late-stage.

"You son-in-law, you truly are astonishing!" Su Peng's face bore admiration, and he was also grateful for finding such a good son-in-law.

While people conversed, the entire hell trembled. Seven days had passed; the several Yama Palaces finally received news that their Palace Princes and Immortal King Late-stage masters had not returned from the Yellow River Tomb.

Hell trembled; the Yama Palace Lords could no longer remain seated, personally heading toward the ancestral god mountain to investigate.

"Luoshengmen (The Life-Seeking Sect)!"

"Tianyuan Sect!" The results of the investigation directly pointed to Luoshengmen and Luo Tian's group.

"Tianyuan Sect is unlikely; they don't have the strength to capture so many Palace Princes and Immortal King Late-stage masters!"

"The greatest possibility is Luoshengmen; how terrifying this sect must be!" Several Palace Lords stood at the original location of the ancestral god mountain, their eyes filled with concern.

They had previously thought Luoshengmen was strong but not stronger than themselves. However, now it seemed they had underestimated Luoshengmen greatly.

"The threat from Luoshengmen is far greater than Tianyuan Sect!" Ku Shen Palace Lord spoke.

"Now, the priority is to rescue our Palace Princes and masters; otherwise, the losses will be too great!"

"Where to find them?" "Find Luo Tian. He was the one searching for Luoshengmen, so he must have some methods. This matter is also related to him. Moreover, he had previously promised to eradicate Luoshengmen. Now, the heavenly realm is almost filling the rift; he doesn't have much time left!"

"If they dare to procrastinate, we'll have an excuse to destroy Tianyuan Sect. The Black and White Officials won't say anything either!" Several Palace Lords kept discussing, finally making a decision.

Several figures vanished, and orders were issued to thoroughly investigate Luoshengmen and Luo Tian's whereabouts.

Luo Tian's group stayed in Zhou Guiwang City for a day; Xiang Tianming and Zhang Chenglong led Diao Dezhu's group to head toward the Tianyuan Sect.

Luo Tian intended to stay in Zhou Guiwang City for a few more days, spending time with Su Dan and Luo Su. After all, he had many important matters ahead and would be away for a long time.

On the second day of accompanying the two mothers, the Ten Palace Yama Lords appeared at the outskirts of Zhou Guiwang City. Upon their arrival, it caused a commotion in the city.

Several Immortal King Peak-level figures stood powerfully above Zhou Guiwang City, their eyes cold as they gazed at the city.

At that moment, Luo Tian was strolling with Su Dan and Luo Su in Zhou Guiwang City. Upon the appearance of the figures, he felt his body locked by several cold auras, halting him.

"Luo Tian!" A senior spoke, the Ku Shen Palace Lord in black robes with a golden dragon embroidered on them.

"Several of you, what is the purpose of your visit to my Zhou Guiwang City?" Before Luo Tian could speak, a figure stepped forward, his voice filled with anger as he looked at the Palace Lords in the sky.

"Fengdu Palace Lord, Shuilu Palace Lord, Ku Shen Palace Lord, Yinxian Palace Lord..."

"My god... what are they planning?" The entire Zhou Guiwang City echoed with gasps.

The Ten Palace Lords rarely appeared in people's sight; this time, they had arrived with six or seven of them, and their auras were extremely cold. It was no wonder the people in Zhou Guiwang City trembled.

"Dad..." Luo Su's eyes showed worry. Since he was by Luo Tian's side, he didn't feel the strong pressure. However, he clearly heard Ku Shen Palace Lord's voice—this was to find Luo Tian. Luo Su wasn't foolish; he knew these Palace Lords weren't here for tea.

"Nothing, you take Su'er back first; I'll check it out!" Luo Tian gently patted Luo Su's shoulder and spoke to Su Dan.

"Be careful!" Su Dan nodded, leading Luo Su toward the Zhou Guiwang Mansion while Luo Tian appeared in the sky.

"Luo Tian, where are our Palace Princes and masters?" Upon entering the grand hall, several Palace Lords shouted.

"Luoshengmen captured them." Luo Tian spoke softly, knowing these people had ill intentions. However, within Zhou Guiwang City, he wasn't afraid.

"Why weren't you captured?" Several Palace Lords sneered, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian, voices filled with anger. Their auras also surged toward Luo Tian.

"Good luck!" Luo Tian replied, but his anger was rising; these Palace Lords clearly directed their anger at him.

"I suspect you kidnapped my Wusheng Palace's Prince! Hand them over, or you won't have a good day. Let me show you our methods!" Another Palace Lord spoke, directly threatening Luo Tian.

"I said they were captured by Luoshengmen. Are you asking for too much?" Luo Tian's temper flared, not caring about the Palace Lords' auras as he spoke loudly.

"Wasn't it Luoshengmen that you were supposed to eradicate? You've made no progress these past days. I suspect your Tianyuan Sect is colluding with Luoshengmen to scheme against our Ten Yama Palaces!" Ku Shen Palace Lord spoke loudly.

Buzz...

As the Palace Lords' words finished, a wave of energy surged through everyone's bodies. This included Luo Tian and Su Peng who also received messages.

"Yusheng Palace, Ku Shen Palace, Fengdu Palace..."
"You have our Palace Princes and masters. If you want them to live, in ten days, send half a ghost vein to Baiduan Mountain. Your Palace Princes and masters should be worth this price!" A voice echoed in everyone's ears, causing the hall's people to frown.

Chapter 2681: Killed ()

"The Ten Palace Princes were captured by a Luoshengmen faction?" Soon, the news of the captured Ten Palace Princes spread throughout hell, causing a commotion.

Luoshengmen suddenly entered the spotlight of all hell. The Yama Ten Palaces had always been the rulers of hell, a fact known to all in hell and even those who had just integrated into hell. However, now Luoshengmen had captured the Ten Palace Princes and even extorted the Yama Palaces. This was an open challenge to the Yama Ten Palaces' dignity.

Crack...

In the Zhou Guiwang Mansion, several Palace Lords' faces were darkened to the extreme. They continuously received messages; the hall echoed with their teeth-clenching voices.

Smack...

The table shattered, breaking before the crowd. Luo Tian's face bore mockery as he looked at the Palace Lords.

Previously, these people had tried to blame him, but now this news hit them in the face.

"Indeed, Yang Huanyu helped me a lot!" Luo Tian thought silently, remaining calm and sipping tea from his cup.

After the Palace Lords' anger subsided, their gazes returned to Luo Tian, and seeing his mockery, their faces darkened further.

"Luo Tian, it was your group that was responsible for eradicating Luoshengmen. This major mistake, your Tianyuan Sect must also take responsibility. So we'll give you one more month!"

"You're bullying us too much!" Luo Tian's eyes turned icy, gazing at the Palace Lords. He hadn't expected them to be so shameless; this was also their fault.

"One month! One month, and we'll rescue our Palace Princes and masters; you're innocent!"

"Bullying us too much? Yes, we are bullying you. Don't forget who is the ruler of hell!" The Palace Lords looked at Luo Tian's angry expression, feeling some satisfaction. Their eyes were disdainful toward Luo Tian.

Although Luo Tian had entered the Immortal King Late-stage, they were still surprised, but in their eyes, he was nothing.

"Enough!" Before the Palace Lords finished speaking, Luo Tian shouted loudly; he could no longer endure it.

"One month! Alright, one month!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his icy aura causing the Palace Lords to frown slightly.

"Good job! We don't care what methods you use; if any hair on those Palace Princes and masters is harmed, we'll make you regret it!" The Palace Lords spoke coldly, their sleeves swirling as they rose and left.

"You guys are really overstepping!" Seeing their demeanor, Su Peng could no longer hold back.

"Su Peng, do you think the techniques left by the First Zhou Guiwang are enough for anything? You! Don't have that qualification!" A cold voice echoed in the hall. The Palace Lords didn't linger and vanished, while Su Peng did not stop them.

"What's your plan?" Su Peng asked Luo Tian with a serious face.

"Back to the Tianyuan Sect!" Luo Tian spoke softly, tightly clenching his fists. Now he had some capital; it was time to let the Tianyuan Sect firmly establish itself in both the heavenly realm and hell.

That day, Luo Tian left the Zhou Guiwang Court, heading toward the Tianyuan Sect. As for the Palace Lords' words, Luo Tian ignored them entirely and didn't care.

"Who dares to move, I'll make them regret it! Also, the Yongyang Mountain should be visited!" Luo Tian's eyes were icy; now the Tianyuan Sect didn't need to endure!

Time flowed slowly. Ten days passed, and it was the time Luoshengmen had given to the Palaces. However, Luoshengmen received nothing.

"It seems you still haven't realized!" Luoshengmen's voice echoed, and at the same time, Ku Shen Palace cried out.

"An Immortal King Late-stage master, Ji Yi Xiu, is dead!" That day, Ku Shen Palace trembled. Other Palaces also were shocked.

The death of an Immortal King Late-stage master was a loss for any Palace, so such deaths were rare.

"In ten days, at Baiduan Mountain, send half a ghost vein; if you don't, we won't know who dies!" Luoshengmen's voice echoed again. A lifeless body was thrown at Ku Shen Palace's gate the next day.

"Provocation, blatant provocation! Killing people and throwing their corpses at our doorstep—what is this Luoshengmen?" This news quickly spread, and people believed Luoshengmen was extremely powerful.

"Search! I want to find Luoshengmen; if found, kill without mercy!" Ku Shen Palace Lord shouted, his voice filled with anger.

Other Palaces also erupted in rage, sending people to search for Luoshengmen's whereabouts. Luoshengmen had completely touched their底线 (bottom line).

"What is Tianyuan Sect doing? Don't they fear being destroyed?" The Palace Lords were enraged. They had previously thought that Luo Tian would compromise as before, helping to redeem the Ten Palace Princes and masters.

Although they couldn't provide half a ghost vein, if Tianyuan Sect emptied the entire sect, it could still gather resources equivalent to two or three ghost veins.

But they hadn't expected Luo Tian to do nothing, and reports indicated that Luo Tian had already returned to the Tianyuan Sect.

"Die! In three days, the heavenly realm will be captured; when the army returns, destroy Tianyuan Sect!" The Palaces issued orders. Only the Wheel Turning Palace did not participate.

...

In the Tianyuan Sect, Luo Tian and others sat in the grand hall; the atmosphere was heavy, with no joy despite Luo Tian's return.

These days, people had received many messages, and the news Luo Tian brought also made them angry.

"Too much! They want to drain us dry, wanting to destroy our Tianyuan Sect. I'll see who has the strength!" The people of Tianyuan Sect were what they were—upon hearing Luo Tian's news, they all cursed.

The current Tianyuan Sect was stronger; Fire Master Meng Wushuang had also advanced to the Immortal King Late-stage. Thus, the Immortal King Late-stage and Immortal King Mid-stage were fully capable of confronting a single immortal mountain or Yama Palace.

"Then fight; prepare yourselves. I'll go to the heavenly realm!" Luo Tian nodded, having endured too long. This time, he would let everyone remember that Tianyuan Sect was not to be trifled with.

"Report, Master! Something happened!" As they discussed, a True Immortal-level disciple rushed in.

"What's the matter?" Jiang Sixi spoke calmly; this was a time of crisis for Tianyuan Sect.

"They had hundreds of disciples killed while training in Qiu Long Mountain!" The disciple's face was angry as he reported to Jiang Sixi.

"Report, Master! We had two hundred disciples and a True Immortal Late-stage elder killed in Cheng Ming Mountain!" Before the disciple's words ended, another disciple rushed in to report.

Chapter 2682: Paying Compensation ()

The reports kept coming, each disciple rushing into the hall to speak with Jiang Sixi. Their eyes were filled with anger.

"Thousands dead at once!" Jiang Sixi's eyes flickered slightly, gazing at the disciple: "Tell me the details one by one!"

"We don't know. They were training, then someone fought over something, and they died in large numbers!"

"We're the same..." One disciple spoke, others also nodded. The situation was basically the same—not done by Bu Tian City but other cities, all related to hell.

"Did they do it?" Jiang Sixi's face darkened; the others in the hall also had cold expressions.

"Announce it, have all disciples returning to Tianyuan Sect!" Jiang Sixi spoke and issued the order.

Bu Tian City was no longer under Wheel Turning Palace control but had been taken over by the Ten Palaces. Other ghost gates were also like this.

"Good, good, good!"

"It seems these Palaces have started to act! Let's storm Bu Tian City and see who can stop us!" The crowd roared.

"Wait a moment!" As the crowd was in chaos, Luo Tian spoke, silencing them.

"Now is not the time; we don't have complete confidence!"

"I'll go to Bu Tian City first and demand an explanation!" Luo Tian's eyes were also cold, thousands of people compared to the current Tianyuan Sect was not much. But this way of dying left no explanation, easily making the disciples of Tianyuan Sect disheartened.

"Have all elders and masters go out; ensure the disciples on training return!" Luo Tian spoke to everyone, then flew toward Bu Tian City.

The entire Tianyuan Sect started moving; powerful figures flew out, contacting the disciples on training.

Luo Tian flew through the sky, thinking about what was next. The Ten Palaces had deep resources; as they were about to tear open, Luo Tian had to be cautious. Even one wrong step could mean eternal ruin.

Flying through the sky, Luo Tian looked at the ground, his eyes filled with admiration. Since the heavenly realm's three days were occupied by hell, many changes had occurred in the middle three realms.

Hell people truly didn't understand governance; although there was no chaos now, it was much worse than before.

The middle three realms had always had conflicts, but there were none as many now. Luo Tian flew for a day and saw several conflicts, all extremely brutal.

After one day of flying, Luo Tian reached the outskirts of Bu Tian City, his eyes filled with admiration. He recalled when he first came to Bu Tian City to resist hell; now, it had been taken over.

Luo Tian stepped into Bu Tian City. The city was still magnificent, but its style had changed.

As an important position entering hell, Bu Tian City did not allow others to occupy it; all were stationed by the Ten Palaces and several kings' cities.

However, despite this, it had become more relaxed; soldiers often went out since they had needs. It was very boring to stay in Bu Tian City for years.

"Master Luo Tian!" Luo Tian stood directly above Bu Tian City, his authoritative voice echoing through the city, causing it to tremble.

An Immortal King Late-stage master could walk anywhere with arrogance; thus, Luo Tian didn't care about the rules.

Almost instantly after Luo Tian's voice echoed, Bu Tian City produced a series of howls. Ten figures appeared in the sky.

"Ah, it's Luo Tian. What business do you have with our small Bu Tian City?" One figure appeared, wearing yellow robes and smiling at Luo Tian. However, his heart was drumming.

Huang Tiancai, a senior of the Huang Palace and now Bu Tian City's governor, with an Immortal King Early-stage cultivation. Huang Tiancai's side stood nine elders who were half-step Immortal Kings. Originally, Huang Tiancai was also a half-step Immortal King, but after hell's attack on the middle three realms succeeded, it added a lot of resources to hell. This allowed hell's strength to increase significantly; Huang Tiancai also successfully advanced to Immortal King Early-stage and became Bu Tian City's governor.

The nine people by Huang Tiancai were from other Palaces, monitoring each other.

"I have over ten thousand disciples of the Tianyuan Sect killed by Bu Tian City; Master Luo is here to demand an explanation!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his Immortal King Late-stage aura pressing down on the ten people, instantly sending them back to the ground.

"Terrifying! I had heard Luo Tian advanced to Immortal King Late-stage, but didn't expect him to be this strong. If he wanted to kill me, one move would suffice!" Huang Tiancai's heart trembled but his face was filled with disbelief.

"What? I didn't know about this!" Huang Tiancai spoke loudly, pretending not to believe.

"Palace Prince!" A middle-aged man by Huang Tiancai's side looked with reverence; this was a disciple of the Wheel Turning Palace.

"Luo Brother, this must be a misunderstanding; it's definitely a mistake. I apologize to you. You know, Bu Tian City has a population of one million; it's impossible for me to cover everything. I will definitely investigate this and give you an explanation!" Huang Tiancai and the others felt bitter inside.

A few days ago, they had received orders to attack Tianyuan Sect; thus, they ordered their soldiers to kill Tianyuan Sect disciples.

What was the strength of Tianyuan Sect? They knew it well; they understood that these soldiers were not enough to even scratch Tianyuan Sect.

However, the Palace Lords had ordered it directly; they couldn't disobey. Moreover, the Palace Lords said Tianyuan Sect would definitely not dare to trouble them; even if they came, they wouldn't be able to do anything.

"Good, I'll wait for your investigation!" Luo Tian smiled and sat down in a place, gazing at Huang Tiancai. This made Huang Tiancai's back cold.

"Good, wait a moment; I'll send people to investigate!" Huang Tiancai spoke and signaled to the others.

At the same time, the Wheel Turning Palace disciple also recounted the situation to Luo Tian.

"It's definitely premeditated! I'll see what explanation Huang Tiancai can give me!" Luo Tian sat there, but Huang Tiancai didn't even offer him a cup of tea.

After an hour, the token on Huang Tiancai's waist emitted waves, making his face dark.

"Acting, keep acting; your performance is terrible!" Luo Tian immediately noticed Huang Tiancai was faking it and a hint of mockery flashed in his eyes.

"Luo Immortal King, I've already investigated this matter; it's indeed our Bu Tian City soldiers who had a conflict with the Tianyuan Sect, accidentally killing them. I will definitely give you an explanation from the Tianyuan Sect!"

"Such a thing, one thousand and five hundred Immortal Spirit Stones per person; they said they accidentally killed two million Tianyuan Sect disciples, totaling one hundred million Immortal Spirit Stones. Please accept this explanation from me!" Huang Tiancai spoke and took out a storage ring, handing it to Luo Tian.

Chapter 2683: Siege ()

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with killing intent, gazing at Huang Tiancai, making him tremble and unable to speak.

"Luo Immortal King, one hundred million Immortal Spirit Stones is no small amount!" Huang Tiancai looked at Luo Tian's stable aura and quickly spoke, his back already soaked with sweat.

"Yes, it's not small; five thousand Immortal Spirit Stones is a considerable sum for a True Immortal-level master!" Luo Tian nodded and took the storage ring.

Seeing Luo Tian accept the storage ring, Huang Tiancai's heart was overjoyed: "The Palace Lord didn't deceive me; this Luo Tian is afraid of the Palaces!"

The people behind Huang Tiancai also sighed in relief. If Luo Tian went crazy, no one in Bu Tian City could withstand the wrath of an Immortal King Late-stage master.

"Since that's the case, Master Luo will take his leave!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, as if nothing had happened, and disappeared from Huang Tiancai's group.

After Luo Tian left, the group fell to the ground, breathing heavily.

"The pressure was too strong; just his aura could crush me!" A half-step Immortal King spoke, his eyes filled with fear.

"Yes, if he hadn't exploded, we wouldn't have been able to stop him!" Others nodded in agreement.

"What does it matter? A high-level Immortal King, with so many of his disciples killed, yet he had to endure it!" Huang Tiancai's face showed disdain, a hint of satisfaction in his heart.
