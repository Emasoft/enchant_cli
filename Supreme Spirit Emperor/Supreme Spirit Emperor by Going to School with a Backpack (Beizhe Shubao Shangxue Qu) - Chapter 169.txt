Now that Luo Tian had reached the eighth-source Celestial Supreme, his perspective naturally became much broader. For some reason, Luo Tian felt that the phantom was unusual; especially after witnessing the marvel of the Book of Epochs, this feeling became even stronger.

"Very well," Luo Tian sighed softly, "I'll return when I have the chance to collect this fragment of the Book of Epochs." Amidst the relentless wails of residual souls, he vanished from the spot and flew toward the exit.

Piercing through the dense mist, Luo Tian soon appeared at the head of the Celestial Bridge. He saw his female subordinates waiting for him, along with several retainers who had freed themselves from the Binding Soul Band. A faint smile crossed his face.

Seeing Luo Tian's arrival, everyone exhaled a long breath. Their gazes turned to him with admiration; they had not expected Luo Tian to emerge unscathed from within.

Though the group was outside the city, they felt the terrifying fluctuations and the countless residual souls passing by them. They understood that Luo Tian's entry into the vast altar had not been easy.

"Let us go," Luo Tian said, his voice devoid of further words. He led them across the Celestial Bridge. With prior experience, their journey was faster. In just three days, they reached the exit.

"You all go first," Luo Tian's face bore a cold expression as he addressed his female subordinates. "After you exit, tell them I did not come out with you."

"Understood," they replied. They knew that after exiting, the situation might not be simple; they would only become a burden to Luo Tian.

With a flicker of movement, the group vanished from Luo Tian's sight. A cold glint flashed in his eyes. He waited for half a day, sensing the exit shrinking. Then he vanished from the spot.

Starting tomorrow, I'll post two chapters daily. I need to think through the subsequent plot and stockpile some material. Recently, I've been quite anxious, with no stored chapters to fall back on. I fear an interruption due to unforeseen circumstances. Apologies, everyone.

Chapter 797: The Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net

Beyond the Sacred Heaven Continent, in the endless starry void, Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian stood with grim faces, watching the entrance of the Sacred Heaven Continent. Behind them, strongholds from two sects had received news and arrived in haste.

"Go and seal this Sacred Heaven Continent for me! I want Luo Tian to have no path upward or downward!" Jin Yongsi barked orders at the White Tiger Sect's strength.

At the same time, Ke Zhen Tian issued the same command to the Scarlet Phoenix Sect's strength. Instantly, the entire Sacred Heaven Continent's perimeter was sealed by a flurry of radiant light.

"Master, if this boy dies at the hands of these two sects, we won't have to honor the blood oath," Dou Jiande observed as the two sects sealed the Sacred Heaven Continent like an iron fortress. A hint of joy flickered on his face.

The memory of Sha Cangmang's promise to Luo Tian at the Supreme Altar made Dou Jiande and his companions feel a pang of resentment.

"That boy isn't so easy to kill," Sha Cangmang shook his head, recalling Luo Tian's terrifying strength.

Hearing Sha Cangmang's words, Dou Jiande and the others exchanged glances. Indeed, if Luo Tian were easy to kill, he would have perished long agoâ€”whether in the black cauldron's soul-stealing or from the beast's jaws. Yet now, he still lived with vigor.

"A thorny opponent," one of the newly promoted eighth-source Celestial Supremes muttered, his gaze fixed on the Sacred Heaven Continent's exit.

"Never mind what he is," another Celestial Supreme said, his eyes gleaming with a desire to watch the tigers fight. "If Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian can kill him, that's best. If not, even if he slays a few of them, it'll weaken both sects."

Hearing this eighth-source Celestial Supreme's words, the others nodded. Luo Tian and Jin Yongsi, Ke Zhen Tian had poor relations with the Blue Dragon Sect. No matter who ultimately suffered defeat, the Blue Dragon Sect's people would be delighted.

"Buzz..." As they discussed, a tremor of teleportation power emanated from the Sacred Heaven Continent's entrance. The retainers who had exited before Luo Tian looked stunned, appearing in the crowd's view.

"Little shrimp!" Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian shook their heads, realizing none of them was Luo Tian. They didn't bother the retainers; after all, Sha Cangmang was present. If they killed them now, it would be like slapping the Blue Dragon Sect in front of everyone.

The retainers, seeing so many high-ranking figures around them, looked terrified and flew toward the Blue Dragon Sect. They bowed slightly with reverence, gazing at Sha Cangmang. What they thought remained unknown.

"Where is Luo Tian?" Sha Cangmang surveyed the retainers but found no Binding Soul Band. His face bore a look of surprise before he spoke softly.

"I don't know," the female subordinate replied, her voice still respectful. Her heart drummed for Luo Tian as she saw three sects had arrived, a massive display that left her in awe.

"Go down," Sha Cangmang said no more, his authoritative voice echoing in their ears. He turned his gaze back to the Sacred Heaven Continent's entrance.

Time flowed slowly, and people waited for half a day. All eyes were fixed on the entrance of the Sacred Heaven Continent.

"That boy won't come out, will he? If so, we've waited in vain!" The sects' people murmured lowly, their faces showing impatience.

"Buzz..." As they grew impatient, the Sacred Heaven Continent's entrance began to shrink gradually. A streak of blue light burst from the shrinking exit.

The entrance slowly closed, signaling the Sacred Heaven Continent's closure. To reopen it would require waiting some time.

Yet no one paid attention to the closing exit; their eyes were all fixed on that streak of blue light.

A terrifying speed, slicing through the endless black void, burst into their view and flew northward.

"Trying to escape? Your speed is fast, even I might not catch you. Fortunately, I had gathered the sect's strength here and made preparations!" Jin Yongsi sneered, his eyes filled with mockery as he gazed at the glowing Luo Tian beneath him.

"I told you, within the Four Sacred Stars, you'd be helpless! Today I'll reduce you to pieces!" Jin Yongsi's mind sneered as he roared at Luo Tian, his primal power surging forth. Countless natural forces converged toward him.

Not only Jin Yongsi, but Ke Zhen Tian's hands also radiated powerful fluctuations, forming a blinding light that shot toward the sky.

The sects' Celestial Supreme masters roared, their primal powers coalescing into a massive net that enveloped the flying Luo Tian. A crushing pressure surged toward him.

"Can't escape?" Luo Tian halted in place, sensing the mounting pressures around him. His body emitted a creaking sound.

This was the combined power of two ninth-source Celestial Supremes, ten seventh-source Celestial Supremes, and dozens of Celestial Supreme masters. Its power was terrifying; even Sha Cangmang would avoid it.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed as the primal net tightened, making his movements increasingly difficult. His body felt stiff.

"Since I can't escape, then let's fight!" Luo Tian's eyes blazed with battle spirit. He swept his gaze over the Scarlet Phoenix and White Tiger Sects' masters, licking his lips with a cruel expression.

"Primordial Seal!" Luo Tian's hands moved slightly, and the Primordial Seal formed instantly. The terrifying seal, wielded by Luo Tian's current state, was fearsome. He didn't hesitate; he used it immediately because he knew how powerful these people were. If he didn't fight with all his might, he might truly perish here.

Before the seal could fall, a gray-breaking mountain technique also emerged, targeting one of the seventh-source Celestial Supremes.

"Truly seeking death!" The seventh-source Celestial Supreme's face bore a mocking expression. He waved his hand, and a primal power hand materialized, striking the gray mountain.

"Explosion..." A thunderous explosion erupted, a violent aura causing nearby stars to rumble.

Luo Tian was now an eighth-source Celestial Supreme, capable of handling ninth-source masters effortlessly. How could this seventh-source master possibly contend with him?

Though the Breaking Mountain Technique was a high-level technique, it rivaled an imperial-grade one in Luo Tian's hands.

The river of stars churned, a violent aura surging toward the seventh-source Celestial Supreme.

The seventh-source master was hurled backward through space, like a meteor, spitting blood before stopping.

Meanwhile, the Primordial Seal also roared forward, striking another seventh-source Celestial Supreme. This one fared worse; his body was flattened as three soul fragments floated out of him.

"Instantly, two seventh-source masters wounded!" The Scarlet Phoenix and White Tiger Sects' people stared in disbelief at Luo Tian.

The primal power net formed by the sects' strongest masters was finally shrinking, just a sliver away from fully enclosing Luo Tian.

Nine-colored domain expanded, eight primal powers coalesced on the domain to block the net's tightening.

"Overreaching! This is our White Tiger Sect's Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net. Can your domain withstand it?" Jin Yongsi sneered, his hands gripping the void fiercely.

With Jin Yongsi's grip, the primal net shrank instantly. Luo Tian's solid domain did not resist at all; it was torn apart by the primal net.

"Crinkle..." The massive net instantly enclosed Luo Tian, pressing his flesh with immense pressure, emitting a creaking sound.

"Who's this flesh? It can withstand it!" The White Tiger and Scarlet Phoenix Sects didn't know Luo Tian was a Blue Dragon Body, their faces showing surprise.

Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian also showed admiration; the White Tiger Sect's Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net had previously torn apart a ninth-source Celestial Supreme. Even they would have to be cautious against it.

Though Luo Tian wasn't torn apart, his body was uncontrollably descending until he collided with an uninhabited star.

The massive impact shattered the entire star, and Luo Tian's form stopped. The Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net was deeply embedded in his flesh, blood gushing from him and turning him into a bloody figure.

"Roar..." Luo Tian roared, but no pain showed on his face; instead, his body rapidly expanded.

"Kid, don't overdo it!" Jin Yongsi saw Luo Tian still struggling and sneered. He summoned a tiger's roar, and a silver spear appeared in his hand, which he hurled toward Luo Tian.

"Today I'll let you taste the feeling of being pinned by a spear!" Jin Yongsi's face bore satisfaction as he spoke.

"Roar..." The silver spear, accompanied by a tiger's roar, streaked through the void toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 798: Crimson Sword Qi

At the critical moment, Luo Tian's eyes bore infinite calmness. His fists clenched tightly, and his forehead was exposed. A verdant green flame rushed into his dantian, igniting two primal powers.

"Boom..." This was the first time Luo Tian had burned his primal power since entering the Celestial Supreme realm. Though the two primal powers were not many, they restored him for a long time.

As the two primal powers burned, Luo Tian's body suddenly expanded. The Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net embedded in his flesh floated out of his body, forming a terrifying storm around him.

"Boom..." Luo Tian roared, his voice like thunder. He raised both arms, and the legendary Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net that could tear apart a ninth-source Celestial Supreme was shattered. It transformed into streaks of primal power, swirling around him like a storm.

Luo Tian seemed unaffected, his body drenched in blood, eyes turning crimson as he gazed at Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian. He extended his hand, grasping the silver streak. It advanced steadily until its tip was one inch from Luo Tian's shoulder.

"Caught!" The crowd's eyes trembled as they watched, stunned that Luo Tian had truly caught Jin Yongsi's spear.

Even more astonishing was that Luo Tian had shattered the Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net, which seemed beyond reason.

"I remember that legend said only one of the Blue Dragon Sect's masters had shattered the Xu Tian Shattered Spirit Net!" a White Tiger Sect elder murmured.

"This kid is more terrifying than the Blue Dragon Sect's master! After all, this was a combined effort of both the White Tiger and Scarlet Phoenix Sects' strength. Its power is even stronger!" a sixth-source Celestial Supreme murmured, his voice filled with awe.

Luo Tian's lips twisted cruelly. The Splitting Heaven Spear appeared in his hand, his face filled with killing intent. He activated the spatial primal power and appeared before a sixth-source Celestial Supreme, instantly launching four spear techniques. Golden light illuminated the black void.

The sixth-source Celestial Supreme was still stunned by Luo Tian's power, but before he could react, Luo Tian had already arrived.

Dazed, a flash of light appeared; droplets of blood fell from the spear's tip, slicing into the sixth-source Celestial Supreme's body and soul.

"Die!" Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian's faces darkened as they saw Luo Tian not fleeing but instead killing their sects' masters. They stepped into the void and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Having burned two primal powers, Luo Tian's strength no longer feared them. Though he couldn't defeat them, they would find it difficult to catch him.

The Seven Steps of Sealing the Heaven unfolded; with one step, Luo Tian appeared before a Scarlet Phoenix Sect's sixth-source Celestial Supreme. He launched three punches, shattering the master's body.

Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian's faces darkened; Luo Tian was not fighting them directly but killing their sects' sixth-source masters. This left them unprepared.

Sixth-source Celestial Supremes had no resistance against eighth-source masters, especially since Luo Tian could even withstand ninth-source masters. The results were predictableâ€”each was instantly killed.

"One... two..." Luo Tian, like a death god emerging from hell, continued to harvest the lives of the sects' sixth-source masters.

"Fifteen!" Luo Tian murmured lowly, his face breaking into a grin. His two rows of white teeth appeared in the crowd's view, clearly terrifying.

At this moment, Luo Tian was still entirely covered in blood, but now the blood wasn't just his own; it was the blood of all the sixth-source masters from both sects.

"Damn!" Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian glared at Luo Tian, gritting their teeth. They had continuously attacked him, but each time he skillfully dodged and killed a sixth-source master. This enraged them.

"Now, it's seventh-source!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with malice as he scanned the sects' seventh-source masters.

"Fool! He's a fool!" The seventh-source masters of both sects saw Luo Tian's wild gaze and screamed in their hearts, terrified to the core.

Luo Tian had given them a terrifying impression. Now he had killed fifteen sixth-source masters and wounded two seventh-source ones.

"There's three more hours; I'll leave one hour for escape, and two hours to kill two seventh-source masters!" Luo Tian assessed his condition, estimating how long he could sustain. He made a decision and vanished again, appearing before the seventh-source master he had previously wounded.

Luo Tian knew to target the weaker ones, so he chose those he had previously injured.

Seeing Luo Tian rushing toward him, the seventh-source master was terrified and fled without resistance, lacking any confidence to fight.

Seventh-source masters were much stronger than sixth-source ones; at least they weren't instantly killed by Luo Tian. However, the moment this seventh-source master turned around, he heard a thunderous sound behind him. Luo Tian's Splitting Heaven Spear arrived instantly, piercing into the seventh-source master's back.

The spear entered his body, its cold aura capable of tearing everything apart. The seventh-source master was terrified to the core. He burned his primal power, increasing his speed by another level and vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

Seeing the seventh-source master escape, Luo Tian showed no surprise. He transmitted spatial primal power to his feet, activated the Seven Steps of Sealing the Heaven, evaded Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian's attacks, and reappeared before the escaping seventh-source master. He launched a punch.

"Boom..." The sound of explosion echoed, and the seventh-source master, already wounded by Luo Tian, was struck again. His body emitted a crackling sound as he spat blood and retreated.

A silver spear appeared in Luo Tian's handâ€”this was the one Jin Yongsi had thrown. He tapped the spear's tail and said softly, "Return it to you!"

"Roar..." The silver spear, like a tiger descending from the mountain, pierced into the severely wounded seventh-source master's body. A white tiger-like phantom emerged from the silver spear, tearing apart the seventh-source master's three soul fragments.

"Ah..." Jin Yongsi's heart ached; this ambush on Luo Tian had cost the White Tiger and Scarlet Phoenix Sects too much. Jin Yongsi finally couldn't control himself, burning his primal power.

Jin Yongsi didn't want to burn his primal power and capture Luo Tian, but Sha Cangmang was watching. If he burned it now, he might let Sha Cangmang profit.

After discussing with Ke Zhen Tian, Jin Yongsi decided to burn his primal power and capture Luo Tian. Meanwhile, Ke Zhen Tian preserved his strength; otherwise, they couldn't be sure if Luo Tian would slaughter all their masters.

A terrifying fluctuation erupted from Jin Yongsi's body, his aged face showing madness. A massive whirlpool formed beneath him in the starry void.

"Kill..." Jin Yongsi's feet moved, and he instantly appeared before Luo Tian. A terrifying pressure invaded Luo Tian's mind.

"Burning three primal powers!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, sensing Jin Yongsi was truly determined to fight. His face bore a serious expression.

Previously in the Sacred Heaven Continent, Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian had burned primal powers to escape from countless residual souls. They recovered after a few days, but then they had only burned one primal power. Now Jin Yongsi burned three primal powers, clearly not giving Luo Tian any chance to escape.

"Can't fight directly! I need to leave!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, then his feet flashed with blue light. He launched the Killing God Fist toward Jin Yongsi.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed, and invisible fluctuations spread outward from their collision, shattering countless stars.

At the same time, Luo Tian's body was struck by Jin Yongsi's fist and spat blood. His body transformed into a streak of light, flying backward.

"Too strong!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly and used the momentum from his flight to move toward the distance, not wanting to fight further.

"Kid, now you want to leaveâ€”too late!" Ke Zhen Tian had already prepared. His face bore a smile, and he blocked Luo Tian's path with a phoenix's cry. A red fist struck toward Luo Tian.

"Trouble!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his face showing anxiety. Though wounded, he still forced a punch.

"Crack..." After colliding with Ke Zhen Tian, Luo Tian's face changed slightly but suffered no major damage.

However, at the same time, Jin Yongsi appeared like a fierce tiger before Luo Tian and hurled his silver spear toward Luo Tian's back.

Luo Tian could no longer fight directly and had to choose to dodge, but Ke Zhen Tian had sealed all his escape routes.

In an instant, a thunderous sound echoed from the endless void outside. A streak of massive crimson sword qi pierced through space, filling people's noses with a bloody scent that made them shudder.

The crimson sword qi pierced through space, cutting through countless stars and striking toward Ke Zhen Tian's back. Its sharp aura made Ke Zhen Tian doubt he would survive if struck.

At this moment, both Ke Zhen Tian and Luo Tian faced the same situation: if they blocked Luo Tian, he would be pierced by the crimson sword qi.

Chapter 799: Nan Gong Yuqing

Beneath the endless void of the Sacred Heaven Continent, both Ke Zhen Tian and Jin Yongsi stood with grim faces.

At this moment, their situations were identical: Ke Zhen Tian wanted to block Luo Tian, but he would inevitably be pierced by the crimson sword qi behind him. He had no doubt that this qi would annihilate him.

Luo Tian was the same; if Ke Zhen Tian blocked him, he would be pierced by Jin Yongsi's silver spear.

Ke Zhen Tian gritted his teeth. Though he was an ally of Jin Yongsi, he hadn't reached the point where he would sacrifice his life for him. His feet flashed with light, and he vanished from Luo Tian's path.

"Go!" Luo Tian didn't miss this opportunity. Without Ke Zhen Tian blocking, his speed surged again. His form vanished from everyone's sight, and a cold voice echoed in the endless void: "White Tiger Sect, Scarlet Phoenix Sect. I remember this debt!"

"Damn!" Jin Yongsi roared and neutralized the crimson sword qi. His face bore a mad expression.

He had burned three primal powers but still failed to capture Luo Tian, which made him furious. He roared and unleashed a terrifying power that shattered several nearby stars. His gaze turned to Luo Tian's escape route.

"Whoever you are, daring to interfere with my plansâ€”this isn't over!" Jin Yongsi roared into the endless void, his voice echoing far.

The Blue Dragon Sect's people watched the floating corpses and blood mist in the starry void with admiration.

"One person, surrounded by two sects, killing over a dozen Celestial Supremes, and still managing to escape. This Luo Tian is truly beyond reason. Now the White Tiger and Scarlet Phoenix Sects will have their headaches. With a person like this existing, Jin Yongsi would surely be haunted by nightmares!"

"Dog bites dogâ€”two mouths full of fur. However, this Luo Tian is truly a talent. Unfortunately, if he were a Blue Dragon Sect disciple, even without the Supreme Master's power, within a hundred years, the Blue Dragon Sect would surely have another ninth-source!" The Blue Dragon Sect's people felt admiration.

"Sha Cangmang, why didn't you intervene earlier? You know he's from the Tianyuan Continent!" Jin Yongsi glared at Sha Cangmang.

"Go away, don't provoke me! I won't hesitate to attack you now!" Sha Cangmang heard Jin Yongsi's scolding. He had never let anyone before, and now he felt countless grievances from agreeing to Luo Tian's conditions.

"You!" Jin Yongsi's eyes darkened. His current state had burned three primal powers, but Sha Cangmang was at his peak. They were not on the same level. Though Ke Zhen Tian was by his side, after this Sacred Heaven Continent journey, the Blue Dragon Sect's high-level combat strength had surged. Three eighth-source Celestial Supremes were enough to withstand Ke Zhen Tian.

"Go... remember not to provoke me!" Sha Cangmang's eyes darkened, unwilling to argue further with Jin Yongsi. He led his Blue Dragon Sect disciples toward the Blue Dragon Continent.

Watching Sha Cangmang's group vanish, Jin Yongsi's face darkened to the core. "Sha Cangmang, one day I'll make you kneel at my feet!"

Seeing the White Tiger and Scarlet Phoenix Sects' masters with heavy losses, Ke Zhen Tian and Jin Yongsi felt pain.

Especially Ke Zhen Tian, who now felt that allying with Jin Yongsi was not a wise choice.

...

Luo Tian's form appeared on an uninhabited star, and his burned primal power completely disappeared. His strength was now at the sixth-source Celestial Supreme level.

"It seems I need two months to recover," Luo Tian sighed, recalling the formidable crimson sword qi. He inwardly wondered who had saved him.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian instinctively extended his spiritual sense outward but suddenly noticed a man standing on an uninhabited star three thousand zhang away.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian activated the Seven Steps of Sealing the Heaven and flew toward that star.

Seeming to sense Luo Tian had noticed him, the man took a step and flew toward the distance.

A crimson sword, white robes, long flowing hair, red light flickering beneath his feetâ€”Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He observed the man's back and deduced he was a young man.

"Friend, please wait! I am Luo Tian. Thank you for your rescue!" Luo Tian pushed his speed to the limit. Though he was a sixth-source Celestial Supreme, with spatial and thunder primal powers mastered, his speed was no worse than the young man's.

Luo Tian's call echoed far, but the young man seemed to ignore it and continued flying forward.

"I won't let you escape!" The young man's challenge ignited Luo Tian's curiosity. He gritted his teeth and activated the Seven Steps of Sealing the Heaven, instantly reducing their distance to fifteen thousand zhang.

But in the next moment, Luo Tian felt like cursing. The young man suddenly surged his speed again, increasing their distance to three thousand zhang.

They chased each other across countless stars and continents, taking an hour in total. Finally, the young man seemed tired of being chased and stopped on an uninhabited star, turning around to await Luo Tian's arrival.

"Phew..." Luo Tian exhaled, seeing the strange young man had stopped. His body instantly appeared fifteen thousand zhang away.

Fifteen thousand zhang was negligible for both of them. At this moment, the young man's true appearance appeared before Luo Tian.

The young man looked quite elegant but what stunned Luo Tian was the endless killing aura surrounding him, as if countlesså†¤é­‚ were howling at him.

Crimson eyes, like two blood moons, paired with his sword, gave Luo Tian a chilling sensation.

"How many people must he have killed to be surrounded byå†¤é­‚?" Luo Tian mused, gazing at the young man.

"Eighth-source Celestial Supreme!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, sensing the young man's cultivation. His face bore surprise; within the Four Sacred Stars, few possessed eighth-source strength. Clearly, this young man was not in Luo Tian's memory.

But Luo Tian also knew that countless talents existed beyond the universe. The Four Sacred Stars were vast, and there might be masters hidden in any corner. This young man's sword qi had forced Ke Zhen Tian to retreat, indicating he was a genius.

Regardless of his identity, he had saved Luo Tian. A thank you was necessary. After thinking, Luo Tian slightly bowed: "I am Luo Tian. Thank you for your assistance. May I know your name?"

"Fortuitous act, no need to thank me. I have a grudge with the four sects! You chased me just to say thanks?" The young man's lips curled into a smile. He grabbed a nearbyå†¤é­‚ and crushed it, appearing cruel.

"Yes!" Luo Tian seemed unaffected, his face also showing a smile as he spoke to the young man.

"You don't fear me killing you? Though you're strong, you're not my match now!" The young man lightly caressed his blood-red sword and drew it out. A thick aura of blood filled the surrounding ten thousand zhang.

Luo Tian felt as if he were in a sea of corpses, the thick killing aura invading his mind.

Luo Tian had experienced much in life; this blood aura, though thick, was far less than the terrifying one from the Book of Epochs. He stood still with a smile on his face.

"Interesting fellow. Today I'm in a good mood. My name is Nan Gong Yuqing. If we meet again, remember not to follow me anymore. If you do, I'll be in a bad mood and kill you!" The young man spoke, sheathing his sword. Blood mist surged back into the crimson sword, and his body transformed into a streak of blood light, vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

"Nan Gong Yuqing, a strange fellow. I hope we meet again!" Luo Tian didn't chase Nan Gong Yuqing. From the young man's words, he understood this person was one who kept his promises.

Luo Tian sighed and flashed with light, vanishing from the star toward the Eastping Continent.

Luo Tian had chased Nan Gong Yuqing far, flying for seven days before reaching the Blue Dragon Sect's jurisdiction. He passed through several continents and finally appeared outside the Eastping Continent.

Seven days had passed, and Luo Tian had recovered one primal power. He was surprised to find that according to his estimation, he should have taken a month to recover one primal power. Yet it had been done in just seven days.

It wasn't until later, after careful observation, that Luo Tian discovered the reason: his chaos primal power.

The chaos primal power was responsible for creation. His dantian constantly emitted this power to repair the other burned light primal power. Now it was repairing the darkness primal power he had gained at the Supreme Altar.

"Now I'm stronger than you!" Luo Tian's eyes bore a hint of admiration as he gazed at the small Eastping Continent, his face showing admiration.

Luo Tian didn't know where to go. In the entire Four Sacred Stars, only Eastping Continent was a place he could come to. The other continents were unfamiliar to him. Though he didn't know how to face Jiang Sxi, he still decided to see her once, even if she chased him out. He wanted to know if Jiang Sxi was doing well.

But just as Luo Tian sighed, a sound of breaking through the void echoed. His face changed instantly, his eyes filled with endless coldness as he vanished from the spot.

Chapter 800: Anger Piercing the Crown

In the endless void, beyond the Eastping Continent by ten thousand li, a streak of light flew continuously. The figure was somewhat battered, and behind it, countless shouts echoed.

"Jiang Sxi, you can't escape!" A cold voice like the abyss's ice echoed as the figure appeared behind Jiang Sxi, striking with a palm.

Fire surged skyward, its terrifying temperature burning through the void, aiming toward the woman ahead.

The woman's lips had dried blood traces. Her back bore a deep scar, and sensing the fiery palm behind her, she gritted her teeth. Her feet flashed with light, and her speed surged again, barely dodging the terrifying palm.

"Ke Xinsui, heh, your sister's death pains you? Blame her for being useless! Wanting to harm meâ€”she should have accepted death!" Jiang Sxi spoke loudly, ignoring the dozens of Celestial Supremes chasing her. She mocked them, though their highest cultivation was only Ke Xinsui's fifth-source Celestial Supreme. However, there were too many of them; if it was one-on-one, Jiang Sxi could definitely kill all of them.

Hearing Jiang Sxi's mockery, Ke Xinsui's face bore a sinister expression as he gazed at Jiang Sxi, who looked battered.

Jiang Sxi was right; Ke Xinxie had indeed died and perished within the Scarlet Phoenix Sect. All sixth-source Celestial Supremes of the Scarlet Phoenix Sect had been called by Ke Zhen Tian to ambush Luo Tian. Only a few fifth-source Celestial Supremes remained in the Scarlet Phoenix Sect to guard it.

Jiang Sxi had taken advantage of the Scarlet Phoenix Sect's emptiness to kill Ke Xinxie. Though Ke Xinsui and others had desperately tried to stop her, she still managed to escape.

A group of fifth-source Celestial Supremes chasing her was a significant challenge for Jiang Sxi. After fierce battles, she had killed five fifth-source Celestial Supremes and three fourth-source ones with her injuries. Now she had escaped the Scarlet Phoenix Sect.

Jiang Sxi felt exhausted to the core, with only four primal powers left in her body. She had burned two during her escape, and fresh blood continuously scattered across the endless void.
