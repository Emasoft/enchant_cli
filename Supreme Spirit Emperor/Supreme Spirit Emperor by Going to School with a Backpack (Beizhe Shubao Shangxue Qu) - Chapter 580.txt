"Brother, I've figured it out. You want to enter the Immortal Realm. Don't worry, once we get there, I'll show you how to fly high!" Ye Chen smiled and said to Luo Tian. At this moment, Ye Chen had already guessed what Luo Tian was thinking. Although he felt a bit puzzled, Ye Chen was very grateful to Luo Tian. If it weren't for Luo Tian, he wouldn't have survived the battlefield and certainly not returned to the Immortal Realm.

"Ha ha, with that statement of yours, I feel at ease!" Luo Tian laughed heartily. He hadn't expected Ye Chen to say such a thing.

"I see who wants to kill us. You should know me, right?" Ye Chen smiled and looked at the nine figures who had flown in front of Luo Tian and himself.

Nine people, exuding a cold and deadly aura. Eight of them wore black armor, their eyes glinting with cold light, their bodies marked by numerous wounds that had already dried. Luo Tian saw a deep exhaustion in the eyes of the eight.

"Yanming Eight Guardians!" Luo Tian immediately recognized them, a hint of amusement in his eyes. He hadn't expected to meet the Yanming Eight Guardians upon returning to the Immortal Realm. Back then, the Yanming Eight Guardians had been given a chance at life by Luo Tian and had disappeared in the Death Desert. Later, when Luo Tian arrived at Bountiful Heaven City, he had encountered the Yanming Eight Guardians again but there hadn't been much interaction. The deep brotherhood among them had moved Luo Tian deeply.

Luo Tian and Ye Chen were puzzled as to why this group of people, who had already completed their military service, was still on the battlefield. According to logic, they should have been able to leave, but now their strength had reached the middle stage of True Immortal.

Although they were not as strong as Luo Tian and Ye Chen, Luo Tian knew that the combined attack of these eight brothers was very powerful. Together, they could handle a True Immortal at the late stage.

Behind them stood a young man in an embroidered robe, looking on with amusement. His gaze was fixed upon Luo Tian and Ye Chen.

"I am Ye Chen of Star River Sect!" Ye Chen also recognized the mark of Central Heaven Merchant Association on them and quickly spoke out, fearing they might misunderstand.

"Star River Sect Ye Chen?" Upon hearing Ye Chen's words, the Yanming Eight Guardians and the young man's expressions changed slightly.

"How is it possible? Ye Chen was said to have died after entering the battlefield eight years ago. How could he appear again?" The Yanming Eight Guardians said nothing, but the young man spoke.

"Looking at both of you, your aura is very ghostly. You must be possessed by ghosts and trying to infiltrate Bountiful Heaven City. Why are you all just standing there? Capture them for me!" The young man shouted.

"You're what kind of person! When did Central Heaven Merchant Association become so arrogant?" Ye Chen's face darkened. He had intended to show off in front of Luo Tian, but the other party hadn't given him any face at all.

"Son of the Central Heaven Merchant Association's leader, Pang Guang!" The young man announced proudly, his gaze filled with arrogance as he looked at Luo Tian and Ye Chen.

"..."

"This name is too strange..." Luo Tian and Ye Chen looked at Pang Guang with a sense of helplessness.

"What? Are you stunned by my name?" Pang Guang looked at their expressions and couldn't stop the smugness in his eyes.

"Such a talentless son of the leader of Central Heaven Merchant Association!" Ye Chen sighed deeply, looking at the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"It seems that following this talentless person has caused these eight people a lot of suffering!" Luo Tian thought to himself, looking at the exhausted Yanming Eight Guardians.

Indeed, it was true. Although Pang Guang was talentless, he wasn't stupid. Central Heaven Merchant Association had money, but he wasn't favored. He was just one of the son's of the leader of Central Heaven Merchant Association.

However, he had been sent to Bountiful Heaven City as a substitute for the real leader's most talented son. Therefore, Pang Guang didn't return but stayed here because he knew that the resources obtained here were much more than those returned to Central Heaven Merchant Association. Moreover, after losing their relic, the Yanming Eight Guardians had been shunned by Central Heaven Merchant Association and were assigned to Pang Guang, accompanying him to Bountiful Heaven City. For eight years, the Yanming Eight Guardians had been loyal and faithful to Pang Guang, but he had treated them like slaves without any respect. For eight years, all their battle achievements were taken by Pang Guang, and with the abundant resources, he had climbed to the late stage of True Immortal.

"Kill them both. That's a big achievement!" Pang Guang shouted, believing that Ye Chen had been missing for eight years and must have died. The person before him was definitely possessed by ghosts.

Of course, even if it were really Ye Chen, after being missing for eight years, everyone thought he was dead. Even if Ye Chen had survived, in this vast battlefield, he must have found some opportunity. Killing Ye Chen might bring him a lot of benefits.

"Master, although these two seem to be ghost cultivators, they have human aura. Moreover, their strength is above ours!" Gui Yi looked at Luo Tian and Ye Chen, sensing a strong danger.

"Smack..." But instead of answering Gui Yi, it was Pang Guang who slapped him across the face. A bright red handprint immediately appeared in front of everyone.

"When did you get to give orders? I told you to kill him, didn't you hear?" Pang Guang sneered and kicked Gui Yi again.

"Yes!" Gui Yi's face showed no expression. Central Heaven Merchant Association had trained them to be killing machines. In their world, there was only obedience; even if Pang Guang told them to die, they wouldn't blink an eye.

The eight of them moved swiftly and surrounded Luo Tian and Ye Chen, their bodies radiating a cold and deadly aura.

"Sadness," Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He looked at Pang Guang, who stood there with great confidence. He felt pity for the Yanming Eight Guardians and also sympathy for them.

"I'll do it, since you've had your fun before. Now it's my turn!" Ye Chen smiled and waved his hand, a black long sword appearing in his grasp.

"Buzz..." As soon as Ye Chen's long sword was drawn, the Yanming Eight Guardians' attack also arrived. Eight sickles, radiating a tremendous fluctuation, rushed toward Luo Tian and Ye Chen without any gaps.

Luo Tian smiled lightly and vanished from the spot, leaving Ye Chen standing there with a black long sword.

"Rustle..." A moment later, Ye Chen moved. The black long sword radiated a tremendous cold light and he slashed it out.

The sound of collision echoed in everyone's ears. Eight clear sounds rose into the black sky.

Who was Ye Chen? Originally, he had been the first talent of Star River Sect. Although he had suffered greatly in Hell, it was because the enemies there were too strong; they either overpowered him or were as good as Luo Tian. These years, thanks to Luo Tian's connections, Ye Chen's strength had rapidly improved. Although the Yanming Eight Guardians were strong, they were still one level below him. In an instant, Ye Chen alone with his sword had suppressed the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"What's going on?" Pang Guang's face changed when he saw Ye Chen suppressing the Yanming Eight Guardians.

The strength of the Yanming Eight Guardians was unquestionable. These years, they had followed him into battle and saved his life multiple times. Pang Guang knew that together, they could kill a True Immortal at the late stage.

" He really is Ye Chen!" As Pang Guang was shocked, a cold voice made him regain his senses. A figure appeared at his side.

"You..." Pang Guang's face changed in panic, and he extended a talisman from his hand. It flew toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The yellow talisman suddenly expanded into a golden mountain, pressing down on Luo Tian. Luo Tian punched out and shattered the golden mountain. His body vanished again, instantly appearing beside Pang Guang. He reached out to grab him.

Although Pang Guang was at the late stage of True Immortal, he was actually weak. He hadn't fought much in these years and could only bully True Immortal at the middle or early stage. But against Luo Tian, he had no chance to resist.

"Crack..." Pang Guang was like a small chicken and was immediately grabbed by the neck in Luo Tian's hand.

"Watch quietly, don't attack me!"

"Do you want to kill me? To gain military achievements?" Luo Tian's face was cold as he looked at Pang Guang.

"No, no!" Pang Guang stammered, his voice filled with fear. It was the first time he had felt such a terrifying person; he couldn't even move.

"Ye Chen, hurry up!" Luo Tian shouted as Ye Chen continued to fight with the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"Don't rush. I've been憋屈 for these years, and now I met a weirdo!" Ye Chen laughed heartily. His long sword kept flashing, colliding with the eight green sickles repeatedly. Each collision caused the Yanming Eight Guardians to spit blood.

Time passed, and the Yanming Eight Guardians had more wounds on their bodies. They were covered in blood but continued to roar and attack Ye Chen.

"Star Field..." Ye Chen roared, and a series of stars flew from his hands. They converged together and pressed down on the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"It's truly Star River Sect's martial arts. This person is indeed the real Ye Chen!" The Yanming Eight Guardians' faces were grim, looking at the falling black stars.

Chapter 2205: Taking in the Eight Guardians

The sound of a thunderous explosion echoed as a massive black star fell from the sky, pressing down on the Yanming Eight Guardians.

The Yanming Eight Guardians' faces were grim. They felt a strong danger on the black star. The eight of them communicated mentally, and their green sickles radiated a dazzling light. They formed a river of blue energy, pressing down on the black star.

Boom... The sound of thunder echoed in all directions. Wind howled, and a violent fluctuation swept over Luo Tian's body. The Yanming Eight Guardians spat blood and fell to the ground.

"Killing me, you don't have that qualification!" Ye Chen coldly looked at the Yanming Eight Guardians and swung his sword to finish them off.

"Don't kill them!" Luo Tian spoke up, stopping Ye Chen. A smile appeared on his face.

"Huh?" Ye Chen was confused and looked at Luo Tian, not understanding why he would let these eight people go. From his knowledge of Luo Tian, he wouldn't have let them go.

"Everyone is an immortal. Why fight and kill? Don't you think so?" Luo Tian grabbed Pang Guang's neck, smiling.

"Yes, yes!" Pang Guang quickly smiled and nodded. At this moment, his life was in Luo Tian's hands; he dared not contradict Luo Tian.

"What?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Ye Chen instinctively looked at him as if seeing another person.

"Is this the one called '睚眦必报' (always retaliating) and '杀伐果断' (decisive in killing), Luo Chen?" Ye Chen thought to himself, looking at a Luo Tian he didn't recognize.

"Eight brothers, follow us. We'll make sure you have food and drink. Following this talentless person will eventually get you killed!" Luo Tian spoke to the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"Ah, I see now!" Ye Chen immediately understood. Luo Tian was valuing talent. He thought of when Luo Tian had insisted he follow him.

"It's impossible!" Gui Yi shook his head lightly. Their loyalty was engraved in their bones and souls; it wasn't enough for Luo Tian to just let them go.

"What if I kill him?" Luo Tian waved his hand with Pang Guang, a smile on his face.

"He dies, and we won't survive either!" Gui Yi spoke with determination.

"Really stubborn!" Luo Tian was quite troubled by the Yanming Eight Guardians. He truly did have some talent for them. Luo Tian's words were true; if these eight continued to follow Pang Guang, they would definitely die. This time it was him who had met them; if it were someone else, they might have already died.

"One last chance! If you don't follow me, then die!" Luo Tian coldly said, his eyes icy as he looked at the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"Death before submission!" The Yanming Eight Guardians still had that expression, as if death was a form of liberation for them.

Although the Yanming Eight Guardians were like machines, they were still people. These eight years had been too exhausting for them. They knew that following Pang Guang would not end well, and they would eventually die without a trace.

"Then I'm sorry, but I have to kill you!" Luo Tian coldly said and slowly tightened his grip.

"Cough cough, big brother, boss, please let me go!" Pang Guang gasped for breath and spoke to Luo Tian, his voice filled with desperation.

"Oh?" A smile appeared in Luo Tian's eyes. He looked at Pang Guang, not expecting this talentless person to have any ideas.

"You are now under this big brother. You are no longer master and servant. Did you hear that?" Pang Guang shouted, looking at the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"This..." Upon hearing Pang Guang's words, the Yanming Eight Guardians' faces immediately showed surprise. They hadn't expected that Pang Guang would give them to Luo Tian.

"Yes!" However, they didn't say anything but nodded and stood up, looking respectfully at Luo Tian.

"That's it?" Luo Tian was somewhat speechless but was satisfied with the result.

"Big brother, boss, can you let me go?" Pang Guang smiled and spoke to Luo Tian with a submissive tone, no longer showing the arrogance he had before the Yanming Eight Guardians.

"Yes, go!" Luo Tian waved his hand and threw Pang Guang away. Then he looked at the Yanming Eight Guardians. Although they were injured, their bodies remained upright behind Luo Tian as if they had no injuries.

"I'm leaving then!" Pang Guang ran away in a hurry, occasionally glancing back.

"Are you now under my command?" Luo Tian looked at the Yanming Eight Guardians, not expecting it to be so simple.

"Yes, Master!" Gui Yi spoke with a stiff voice and looked at the departing Pang Guang without any emotional fluctuations.

"Go kill him!"

"After killing him, go find me in Bountiful Heaven City!" Luo Tian coldly said and looked at the direction where Pang Guang disappeared.

"Yes!" The Yanming Eight Guardians didn't say anything but flew off towards the direction of Pang Guang. However, a flicker of excitement in their eyes was fleeting.

"Are you so confident?" Ye Chen's face showed interest, looking at the Yanming Eight Guardians chasing after Pang Guang and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Confident, of course!"

"This is also a test for them. These eight people might have been tortured by Pang Guang, and I'm helping them take revenge. If they really kill Pang Guang, it means they will follow me in the future. If they can't, then they don't deserve to follow me. If they never return, this is my final release for them!" Luo Tian spoke softly and took a step towards Bountiful Heaven City.

"The next part of the journey is familiar to me. It won't take long before we reach Bountiful Heaven City!" Ye Chen hadn't expected Luo Tian to have thought so much. He spoke to Luo Tian, and the two of them disappeared from the spot.

This time, they didn't encounter any obstacles. They flew for three days and finally arrived at the place they had left eight years ago, Bountiful Heaven City. The high walls radiated a cold atmosphere. A group of guards stood on the city walls, looking at those outside Bountiful Heaven City.

"Who are you?" The guards shouted and looked at Luo Tian and Ye Chen. Both of them had a strong ghostly aura, not resembling human cultivators.

"Buzz..." A fluctuation of martial arts rose on the city walls, locking onto Luo Tian and Ye Chen.

"I am Ye Chen of Star River Sect. I was mistakenly sent to Hell after entering the battlefield eight years ago. Today, I have returned to Bountiful Heaven City!" Ye Chen shouted loudly with excitement.

"Star River Sect? Ye Chen?" The soldiers on the city walls were elite. Upon hearing Ye Chen's words, they became confused. Ye Chen hadn't been mentioned much in recent years, and those who had come with him for military service were few. However, the name of Star River Sect was known in Bountiful Heaven City, so they didn't attack.

"His name sounds familiar. I think I've heard it somewhere before!" However, people soon became confused and felt that Ye Chen's name was somewhat familiar.

"I remember now. Star River Sect's first talent, Ye Liangchen, has been looking for his older brother!" People suddenly exclaimed.

"Liacheng is still in Bountiful Heaven City?" Upon hearing the people's discussion, Luo Tian and Ye Chen looked at each other with disbelief. However, both felt a warm sense of comfort. They knew that Ye Liangchen had stayed in Bountiful Heaven City because both Luo Tian and Ye Chen had disappeared. Although Ye Liangchen was afraid of death, he valued emotions.

However, the city gates still didn't open. Both of them had a strong ghostly aura and needed to be reported so the commander could confirm if there were any issues.

"Buzz..." As the guards disappeared, a figure appeared on the city walls. He looked down at Luo Tian and Ye Chen.

Dressed in black armor, holding a golden sword, his cold gaze surveyed Luo Tian and Ye Chen. This person was the Black Armor Army Commander of Bountiful Heaven City, Ke Duanshan.

"Come up!" Ke Duanshan grabbed Luo Tian and Ye Chen with his hand, lifting them onto Bountiful Heaven City. His gaze swept over the two of them.

"Are you Ye Chen? Then who is this?" Ke Duanshan frowned slightly, having grabbed the two of them. Since they were unharmed, it meant that they were indeed human because if their bodies had been possessed by ghosts, the city's great array would react and purify the ghosts.

"This is my friend in Hell!" Ye Chen smiled with excitement, looking at everything in Bountiful Heaven City. However, he didn't dare to reveal Luo Tian's true identity; if he did, he might be captured by Ke Duanshan immediately.

"Ah, your military service has ended. You can leave anytime. As for this friend of yours, we need to investigate a bit more!" Ke Duanshan frowned slightly and surveyed Luo Tian. As for the strong ghostly aura on their bodies, Ke Duanshan didn't ask further; he was only confirming Ye Chen's identity. Ye Chen's identity was indeed correct, but Ke Duanshan felt a strange familiarity with Luo Tian.

"I would like to see Liacheng first, and then decide!" Ye Chen spoke with anticipation.

"Ah, go ahead. Follow me," Ke Duanshan said to Luo Tian without giving him a chance to react, grabbing him and disappearing from people's sight.

Ye Chen walked down the city walls without worrying about Luo Tian, as he knew that this person had been thriving in the Wheel Turning Palace. At present, there were few people in Bountiful Heaven City who could harm Luo Tian.

Before Ye Chen even reached the bottom of the city walls, a group of figures appeared in his view. They radiated an overwhelming aura, with the first being a large man.

"Zhang Desheng!"

"Ye Chen!" They both spoke at the same time. Zhang Desheng's eyes were filled with disbelief, as he couldn't believe his own eyes and rubbed them, looking at Ye Chen.

"Yes, it's me!" Ye Chen smiled lightly. Zhang Desheng was the platoon leader who had followed Luo Tian.

"Ye Chen, you came just in time. Hurry and come with me to save Liacheng. He hasn't returned for over a month!"

Chapter 2206: Xue Zilong

In the black hall, Luo Tian continuously surveyed the surroundings. He felt admiration.

"Who are you? Why have you come to Bountiful Heaven City?" Ke Duanshan scrutinized Luo Tian and asked.

"You haven't changed at all!" Luo Tian smiled with admiration, looking around the hall. This was where Ke Duanshan had originally brought him to obtain ghost medicine.

"Respect the commander!" Luo Tian bowed with his hands clasped, showing respect. Ke Duanshan had been good to him before.

"Did you know me?" Ke Duanshan was immediately confused, looking at Luo Tian's face and not recalling where he had seen him.

"I am Luo Tian!" Luo Tian spoke softly, waving his hand across his face to restore his original appearance. He also took out the wristband symbolizing the identity of Bountiful Heaven City soldiers and wore it on his hand, symbolizing a platoon leader.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Ke Duanshan's face showed disbelief. His gaze was fixed on Luo Tian as if struck by lightning, unable to believe that the young man before him was actually Luo Tian.

"Are you really Luo Tian?" Ke Duanshan, after a moment of shock, still couldn't believe it. He checked Luo Tian's wristband and confirmed that it was indeed Luo Tian's.

"Without a doubt!" Luo Tian smiled lightly. He knew that Ke Duanshan and others must have thought he was dead.

"Ha ha, I never expected it. You've returned!" Ke Duanshan laughed heartily.

"I'm not just back, but I also brought the essence of the mother of the Nirvana Flower. I wonder if it can save General Bloodface!" Luo Tian smiled and responded.

"The essence of the mother of the Nirvana Flower!" Ke Duanshan's body trembled. He had never before regarded Luo Tian so seriously.

Ke Duanshan hadn't expected Luo Tian to remember this matter. Eight years ago, after the explosion of the King of Hell's Palace, most cultivators were blown into Hell. Only a few people who were close to Bountiful Heaven City managed to survive.

The rest of the people, including many talents, knew that returning was unlikely. It was almost impossible to return.

That Ye Chen could return seemed like a great achievement in Ke Duanshan's eyes. But he hadn't expected Luo Tian to have survived and brought back the essence of the mother of the Nirvana Flower.

However, Ke Duanshan didn't ask about what Luo Tian had experienced in Hell. Everyone has their secrets.

"Come on, let's go to General Bloodface and give him the essence. His condition has been bad for these two years!" Ke Duanshan sighed deeply and grabbed Luo Tian, disappearing from the hall.

In a moment, Ke Duanshan brought Luo Tian to the eighth regiment's camp. The terrain was like nine dragons surrounding a pearl, and several platoon leaders were not far from where Ke Duanshan lived. Therefore, the two of them quickly arrived at General Bloodface's place, which was Zhang Ziping's residence. However, there were many people surrounding the courtyard of Zhang Ziping, and each person had an overwhelming aura. The weakest was at the middle stage of True Immortal, with some reaching the late stage. There were dozens of people.

The sound of collisions echoed within the courtyard, and a cold and sinister atmosphere spread. A golden barrier surrounded the entire courtyard.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian's face changed immediately, not knowing why anyone would dare to provoke General Bloodface.

"General Bloodface has been in bad condition for these two years. His cultivation is somewhat unstable, so many people want to challenge him and become platoon leader!"

"But I am the commander. If I interfere forcefully, it's not in line with the rules!"

"His two younger brothers are also good at cultivation, but they haven't reached their peak in these years," Ke Duanshan sighed deeply.

"It's really a pity. This is the third dozen or so, and if this continues, General Bloodface might not be able to withstand it!" A loud voice rang out. The rough tone made Luo Tian recognize that the voice was from someone he had met before, the Axe.

"Back then, Xue Zilong didn't dare to say a word in front of General Bloodface. I never expected him to have the courage to challenge General Bloodface now!" Other voices rang out, also from platoon leaders. However, Luo Tian didn't know them.

"General Bloodface, you're already at your limit. If you're smart, just admit defeat and leave here!" A cold voice rang out, making Luo Tian feel a surge of killing intent.

"Commander!" The appearance of Ke Duanshan and Luo Tian immediately caught people's attention. They showed respect, bowing to Ke Duanshan.

As for Luo Tian, people didn't pay much attention. They found him unfamiliar since he hadn't often entered the inner courtyard of Bountiful Heaven City before.

Luo Tian had indeed been impressive, with his ghost medicine and strength. He had been very prominent at that time, but most people only heard of him without seeing him. It had been eight years since then; who could remember Luo Tian? Only those who were familiar with him at that time would recall him.

"Ah, I want to go in and take a look!" Ke Duanshan nodded and walked into the crowd with Luo Tian, allowing both of them to see the scene within Zhang Ziping's courtyard.

Within the barrier of the courtyard, two figures were continuously clashing. A blood-colored mask and white long hair danced with an icy long sword, colliding with a purple long sword.

However, Zhang Ziping's current condition was truly bad. His blood and energy were weak, his body thin and frail. Each collision with the purple long sword caused his hands to tremble slightly.

"It's him!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with more killing intent. He recognized the person clashing against Zhang Ziping.

When Luo Tian had created ghost medicine, it caused a sensation. Many thousand-man leaders came out of the inner courtyard to recruit him. This person in purple robes was one of them. However, he had been very arrogant and even wanted to kill him. But for some reason, he had given up.

Luo Tian hadn't expected this person to challenge his older brother now. Moreover, his current cultivation was not just the late stage of True Immortal but had reached the peak stage.

"Ha ha, you want this platoon leader position? I'll give it to you. But it's not yours to sit on!" Zhang Ziping laughed coldly and his long sword radiated a tremendous chill, freezing his arm and the hilt together.

"You'll die if you keep being so stubborn!" Xue Zilong shouted and his long sword continuously slashed, forming a series of purple snakes that rushed toward Zhang Ziping.

"Freezing Winter!" Zhang Ziping roared and a cold atmosphere spread, with ice power spreading outward. The purple snakes were instantly frozen.

The icy world made Xue Zilong's face show concern, and his long sword radiated a purple light, beginning to fight against the ice power.

The two entered into a stalemate. Meanwhile, people around them showed admiration, knowing that Xue Zilong was trying to exhaust Zhang Ziping.

"Commander!" As the two were in a stalemate, Xue Zilong and Zhang Ziping noticed the arrival of Luo Tian and Ke Duanshan.

"Luo Tian!" Zhang Ziping's body trembled. His blood-colored eyes showed disbelief, then turned to joy.

"It's a good opportunity!" Xue Zilong saw Zhang Ziping's unstable mind and felt happy. His long sword radiated ten thousand purple lights, and the powerful purple energy overpowered the ice power. It struck Zhang Ziping's body.

"Spit..." Zhang Ziping spat out blood and was thrown back, colliding with the barrier.

"Ha ha, General Bloodface, you still dare to be distracted. You really don't respect me!" Xue Zilong's face showed satisfaction and laughed.

"Today I want to see what's behind your mask!" Xue Zilong's face showed satisfaction and he slashed his long sword.

The purple blade cut through the sky, rushing toward Zhang Ziping. Xue Zilong's eyes showed coldness.

"This slash isn't to cut through the mask. It's clearly to kill General Bloodface!" People immediately started discussing, their eyes filled with sorrow.

However, people were surprised to see that General Bloodface simply stood up and looked at the purple blade rushing toward him.

"Didn't you fight back?" People were immediately shocked. Xue Zilong's slash was strong, but General Bloodface could still block it if he wanted to.

"Buzz..." In a flash of lightning, the purple blade reached Zhang Ziping's front. However, a black long sword suddenly appeared and clashed with the purple blade.

"Crack..." Thunder echoed. A figure wrapped in black energy stood before Zhang Ziping, his eyes radiating a tremendous killing intent. He looked at Xue Zilong.

"Who are you?" Upon seeing Luo Tian, Xue Zilong's face changed. Others couldn't recognize Luo Tian, but he could because he remembered that he had once wanted to teach Luo Tian a lesson and was warned by General Bloodface, eventually giving up.

"Who is this person? He came with the commander!" People's faces immediately showed fear, looking at Luo Tian.

"His name sounds familiar but I can't remember who he is."

"But this person's ghostly aura is extremely strong, even surpassing the ghost cultivators of Kanmen. What kind of background does this person have?" People immediately became curious and carefully observed Luo Tian.

"Why are you disturbing my challenge for the platoon leader position?" Xue Zilong frowned, sensing a danger from Luo Tian.

"I am Luo Tian. General Bloodface's younger brother!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and a glow appeared.

Chapter 2207: Powerful Luo Tian

"Younger brother?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, people around him showed confusion and looked at him.

"His younger brother is Lei Ming and Heiye, right? They aren't in the camp. How did another younger brother appear?"

"Luo Tian, his name sounds familiar." People immediately became confused. However, at this moment, the light on Luo Tian's wrist also glowed.

"I give up. From today on, you are the platoon leader!" As people were confused, General Bloodface's cold voice echoed in their ears, causing a commotion.

"How is it possible? He had resisted over thirty people before. Xue Zilong was at the peak of True Immortal, but General Bloodface might not have been able to withstand it if he fought back!" People were immediately doubtful and couldn't believe General Bloodface.

"Is this General Bloodface? He just gave up the platoon leader position?" Other platoon leaders looked at General Bloodface as if they didn't recognize him.

"Really?" Xue Zilong looked at General Bloodface with doubt, but then his face showed great joy.

"Ha ha, this is about right. Your current condition isn't suitable for staying in the platoon leader position!" Xue Zilong laughed and looked at his wrist, which gradually turned black. This was the color of military achievements for a platoon leader, worth one hundred million military achievements.

"Alas... it's a pity. General Bloodface was so strong before, but now he has such an ending!"

"It's also deserved. If I were him, I would have stepped down at the peak and known my own condition. He's been holding onto the position without doing anything, eventually having to give it up! After all, this is a military camp. Strength rules and the fittest survive!" People whispered among themselves.

Many people had already started to flatter Xue Zilong, wanting to get on his good side.

Although Xue Zilong had just become a platoon leader, his foundation was still unstable. Many people would challenge him in the future. However, being able to take over General Bloodface's position was enough to show Xue Zilong's strength.

"Thousand-man leader, Luo Tian, challenges platoon leader Xue Zilong!" As people were shocked, a cold voice echoed in their ears.

"Rustle..." A commotion spread. People's faces showed disbelief, looking at Luo Tian.

"My things aren't that easy to take!" General Bloodface sat cross-legged on the ground, looking at Xue Zilong.

"Luo Tian? Thousand-man leader?" People suddenly remembered. Eight years ago, Bountiful Heaven City's youngest thousand-man leader was Luo Tian. Lei Ming had lost to Luo Tian and became a thousand-man leader with half-step True Immortal.

"By using ghost medicine, he obtained terrifying battle achievements and exchanged a lot of treasures in the merit hall. He had changed the price of ghost medicine!" People suddenly remembered Luo Tian, their faces filled with disbelief.

"Back then, after the explosion of the King of Hell's Palace, he was also missing. He hadn't died! For eight years, from half-step True Immortal to late stage of True Immortal. What did he experience during these eight years? His cultivation speed was so fast!"

"His ghostly aura is so strong. He must have become a ghost cultivator!" People started to talk, looking at Luo Tian with admiration and curiosity. They were very curious about how he had returned to Bountiful Heaven City.

"But, a True Immortal at the late stage challenging one at the peak. Where did he get the courage?"

"Lei Ming and Heiye were also at the late stage of True Immortal, even about to reach the peak. They couldn't beat one at the peak either. How could he be so confident?"

"Unexpectedly, Luo Tian is General Bloodface's younger brother! I heard that General Bloodface had tried to kill Luo Tian several times!" People discussed, not knowing what the two were up to. Even Ke Duanshan was shocked by Luo Tian and General Bloodface, not expecting them to have such a relationship.

"Rushing the eagle!" Ke Duanshan immediately understood General Bloodface's actions and thought of a word.

"Luo Tian came to Bountiful Heaven City before, perhaps he hadn't recognized General Bloodface. Therefore, General Bloodface's actions were very successful. Luo Tian's strength had also improved quickly!"

"Unfortunately, something went wrong later, but it was still successful. The eight years in Hell, Luo Tian had survived, which showed his uniqueness!" Ke Duanshan thought to himself and looked at Luo Tian with admiration.
