“It should be about right!” Luo Tian muttered lowly, rising to his feet slowly. He concealed his presence, like a hunter waiting for prey.

After an hour, the sound of breaking through the sky echoed outside the forest. Five dark figures appeared within the mountain woods.

Each of these five figures radiated powerful auras, their eyes cold and bodies exuding an eerie ghostly aura.

One was a late-stage True Immortal, four were mid-stage True Immortals—among them was Huang Bai Shui.

“Huang Bai Shui, you’re not deceiving us, are you? We often come here, but we’ve never seen anyone here,” a late-stage True Immortal yawned longingly, his eyes heavy as if he couldn’t sleep.

“No, I did see a severely wounded person yesterday. His aura was strong—probably a late-stage True Immortal. I didn’t dare to attack, so I reported it to you. This is a major achievement!” Huang Bai Shui replied.

“Let’s go in and check. A severely wounded late-stage True Immortal—our group should have no problem!” One of the figures, towering in stature, sneered and stepped into the forest.

Huang Bai Shui and the other three ghostly figures followed behind this late-stage True Immortal, heading toward the location Huang Bai Shui and Luo Tian had previously designated.

Luo Tian stood there, his expression grave. He even sealed his breath and switched to internal energy because he knew some ghosts had bizarre abilities; one mistake could reveal him.

Luo Tian’s first plan was to lure Huang Bai Shui into bringing the most powerful subordinate of the Bloodthirsty Ghosts here, then control or kill him.

An hour later, Huang Bai Shui led the four to their designated ambush spot. Upon arrival, the late-stage True Immortal ghost’s brows furrowed slightly, a bad premonition rising in his heart.

“Let’s leave!” The late-stage True Immortal ghost felt a sudden sense of danger and turned to flee.

But just as he was about to leave, a series of humming sounds arose. A demonic moon rose, and two black lightning bolts shot out instantly. A dark divine radiance flew toward the late-stage True Immortal ghost.

“Damn!” The ghost’s face darkened instantly. A powerful pressure descended upon the group, causing their cultivation to flow sluggishly.

At the same time, a primal fear swept through the ghosts’ minds—this fear came from the Three-Headed Dog and Erhei.

The Soul-Controlling Seal, combined with the dual pressure of the Three-Headed Dog and Luo Tian’s ultimate-level True Immortal suppressing the True Immortals, made them tremble.

This very tremor allowed Luo Tian’s射日弓 (Shooting Sun Bow) to fire the灭神箭 (Annihilation Divine Arrow), which struck the late-stage True Immortal ghost’s heart.

The Three-Headed Dog opened its mouth and spat out a black lightning bolt from the sky, striking the late-stage True Immortal ghost.

At the same time, Huang Bai Shui unleashed a wave of roaring sound, forming a hand that struck the late-stage True Immortal ghost.

“Boom…” In an instant, the late-stage True Immortal was instantly killed and dissolved into a cloud of black qi, vanishing from their sight.

Eight-colored flames surged forth, instantly incinerating the cloud of black qi as if it had never existed.

“Tricked!” The other three mid-stage True Immortal ghosts realized instantly, their eyes turning to Huang Bai Shui with fury.

“Too late!” Luo Tian’s body flickered, appearing before the ghost with large eyes. The Soul-Controlling Seal roared as it pressed down upon the True Immortal ghost.

“Rustle…”, a sky-high aura surged forth. Huang Bai Shui’s hands formed a yellow river, entangling one of the mid-stage True Immortal ghosts.

The last mid-stage True Immortal fared even worse. Two black dogs directly bit into his body, tearing off a large chunk of flesh—no signs of regeneration.

“Boom…” The Soul-Controlling Seal descended, crushing the large-eyed ghost to the ground.

“Die or live!” Luo Tian coldly spoke. The other two ghosts were subdued by Huang Bai Shui.

As for the one bitten by the dogs, it was crippled and howled in agony.

“Live!” The large-eyed ghost quickly spoke, looking at Luo Tian with fear.

“Hum…” Luo Tian extended a hand, three divine radiance arrows flew toward the three ghosts.

The three ghosts didn’t hesitate and swallowed the divine arrows into their bodies. Luo Tian then收回 (retracted) his Soul-Controlling Seal.

He took a breath, a slight smile in his eyes as he spoke to Huang Bai Shui: “This method works!”

The three ghosts looked at Luo Tian with fear, seeing this person had instantly killed a late-stage True Immortal—something they found hard to believe.

The effects of the Soul-Controlling Seal spread, and the three ghosts’ eyes changed. A sense of respect now lingered in their gazes.

“Indeed, it works!” Huang Bai Shui looked at Luo Tian, his mind awed by Luo Tian’s strength. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have grown so fast.

“Alright, rest well. Later, you’ll escort me back,” Luo Tian chuckled lightly,收回 (retracted) the Soul-Controlling Seal and the two dogs, speaking to the three ghosts.

Chapter 2110: Prison ( )

In the black forest, several figures walked. A black inscription dragon coiled around Luo Tian, and the three ghosts trembled in their minds, gazing at the figure walking ahead—this person had killed a late-stage True Immortal. The previous instant killing of the late-stage True Immortal had left them in shock, though they now submitted, still fearing Luo Tian. Especially the two dogs gave them immense pressure.

Moreover, these three had now learned of Luo Tian’s plan to outwit the Bloodthirsty Ghosts—this was astonishing.

Three mid-stage True Immortals scheming against a late-stage True Immortal—no one would believe it. Yet this ancestor dared to do so.

“Don’t tremble, stay normal!” Luo Tian coldly scolded the three. Their current state would surely raise suspicion.

After flying for nearly half an hour, they finally saw the Heavenly Slaughter City. They landed and walked for another half-hour before arriving at the city.

The black walls, two heavenly-stage ghosts saw Huang Bai Shui and others approaching. Their eyes showed respect.

“Four masters, you’ve captured a fresh meal!” Two guards spoke immediately, their eyes showing a bit of sympathy toward Luo Tian before opening the city gates to let them in.

The entire city was desolate, with only dark figures walking the streets, their faces numb.

Under the eyes of the city’s ghosts, Luo Tian was escorted by Huang Bai Shui and three others to the entrance of a grand hall. Before entering, a scent of blood was already transmitted from within.

“Just委屈 (suffer) for a while!” Huang Bai Shui spoke, greeted the two guards of hell, and led Luo Tian into the hall.

Upon entering the hall, a dampness and moldy smell surged forth. There was also a stench of rot. In the distance, several flesh-eating ghosts were devouring withered corpses, making gulping sounds.

“These are people who had their cultivation reduced and eventually died!” Huang Bai Shui spoke to Luo Tian, leading him deeper into the prison.

Passing through row after row of cells, each cell was filled with people. Some had numb expressions, their faces pale and thin—regardless of age or gender, they were all like this.

Seeing four ghosts escorting Luo Tian in, some people’s eyes lit up slightly. They looked on with malicious joy.

“Another unlucky one! Hmph, his aura is so strong. We might get a few days of relief!” People whispered among themselves.

Those imprisoned here had the greatest hope that new arrivals would come, so they could be spared some torment.

Passing through multiple cells, Luo Tian was led to the deepest part. This attracted attention because the deeper one went, the more potential and strength the person had.

“Is this a genius from a family?” People became curious about Luo Tian’s identity.

“The last cell!” The four led Luo Tian to the end of the corridor, which was also where Ye Chen was imprisoned.

The cell wasn’t large. Five people were inside—five beds, each occupied by a person: two elders, one middle-aged man, and two youths.

Luo Tian’s arrival caught the five people's attention. However, after opening their eyes and glancing at Luo Tian, they closed them again.

“Ye Chen…” Luo Tian quickly spotted Ye Chen, but Ye Chen didn’t recognize Luo Tian.

“What a pity…” Luo Tian looked at Ye Chen. His body seemed almost skeletal, his aura weak—his cultivation had dropped to half a True Immortal.

Back then, Ye Chen was so full of vigor. Now he looked like this—Luo Tian felt a deep sigh.

The other four’s auras were similar, all looking like they had been drained of their flesh.

“Enter!” Huang Bai Shui signaled Luo Tian with a glance, then shoved him into the cell.

“Let me out… let me out! Do you know who I am? Dare to let me out!” Luo Tian immediately shouted wildly, his body constantly colliding with the cell door. However, black qi surged back, pushing him away.

Huang Bai Shui and the three ghosts’ mouths twitched. They walked out of the cell, secretly sighing at Luo Tian’s acting.

“Haha, kid, you can shout all you want. No one will come. Believe me, just focus on cultivating here. Otherwise, your life won’t last two months!” An elder opened his eyes slowly and grinned, showing a row of yellow teeth.

“In this place, no matter who you are, you’ll be drained. Only by constantly cultivating and replenishing can you maintain your life!” The elder spoke again, his eyes showing greed.

But after speaking, he closed his eyes and resumed cultivation.

“I’m here to save you!” Luo Tian spoke, stepping toward the last bed in the cell. Just as he was about to sit down.

“Who allowed you to sit?” Before Luo Tian could sit, the people on the beds suddenly opened their eyes, looking at Luo Tian with sharp gazes.

“Didn’t you know to greet the elders first?” One elder spoke, his voice cold.

“I did! I said I’m here to save you!” Luo Tian raised an eyebrow, a slight smile in his eyes.

He had heard before that old prisoners would oppress new ones. Some even took their desires out on the newcomers. Luo Tian hadn’t expected to run into this.

“Save us? You’re in such a state yourself. How can you save us?” One elder spat out a foul-smelling black saliva, which corroded the void and flew toward Luo Tian.

“Disgusting!” Luo Tian felt nausea, his eyes flashing cold. He activated the Heavenly Dragon Unconquered Art, forming a black dragon that surged toward the elder.

It dispersed the foul-smelling saliva and charged at the elder with its stench.

“Boom…” The black dragon exploded in front of the elder, sending him flying and colliding with the wall.

“This…” Seeing the elder spitting blood, people’s faces changed. Their gazes toward Luo Tian were different now.

The elder was originally a resident of the Heavenly Slaughter City, his cultivation had dropped to mid-stage True Immortal after being drained by the Bloodthirsty Ghosts. But he was still very strong—ordinary mid-stage True Immortals couldn’t match him.

Ye Chen also opened his eyes, looking at Luo Tian. He had suffered a lot before ending up here.

“Granduncle!” Another youth’s face changed, looking at the elder. The middle-aged man stood up, his eyes tightly fixed on Luo Tian.

“You dare to die!” The elder stood up, his eyes fierce. He flew toward Luo Tian.

The middle-aged man and youth also rose, their bodies radiating strong fluctuations as they rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” Luo Tian smiled coldly, not even standing up. He punched directly at the elder’s withered fist.

Externally strong but internally weak, Luo Tian had already noticed these people were at their last breaths.

“Crack…” A crackling sound echoed. The elder flew backward, blood spilling from his mouth.

Two more punches sent the middle-aged man and youth flying, colliding with the wall beside the elder.

The tremors soon attracted attention from other cells. Others smiled.

“It seems another new prisoner is being beaten up! That kid looked pretty strong!” People whispered, their eyes showing smiles.

“I said I’m here to save you. Do you believe me now?” Luo Tian stood up slowly, stepping toward the three with a pressure from his ultimate-level True Immortal. This made the five people in the cell feel unprecedented pressure, their cultivation suppressed by fifty percent.

“Believe… believe…” The three trembled and spoke. Even the elder, a late-stage True Immortal, had never seen such a strong mid-stage True Immortal.

“Talents! It must be a talent from a great family. If he really said that, we might have hope!” The five people instantly felt a glimmer of hope.

“Shut up!” Just as Luo Tian was about to scold the three, a series of shouts echoed from outside the cell. A figure in late-stage True Immortal appeared at the cell’s entrance.

“Don’t fight, don’t spill blood. The city lord will be angry if you do!” A guard scolded.

“Do you think you’re still the city lord?” The guard’s face showed disdain, looking at the elder and three with a sneer.

“You…” The elder’s face turned pale but he forced himself to suppress his anger and sat back on the bed.

“That’s right. Now you must recognize your identity—prisoner. Not only others, even I can kill you!” The guard showed disdain and left.

“Damn it. This little jailer, who I didn’t even look at before, dares to talk to me like that!” The elder’s face darkened. He looked at Luo Tian with a murderous intent, but he dared not provoke further and sat back down.

“Brother, how did you get in?” Luo Tian saw the elder and three were now calm. He hurried to Ye Chen’s side, speaking to him.

But the elder remained seated, only opening his eyes slightly when Luo Tian fought.

“I…” Ye Chen’s eyes showed a fierce look, but he shook his head gently and didn’t speak.

“Believe me. I’ll definitely save you out!” Luo Tian patted his chest, a confident smile on his face.

“How?” Ye Chen was drawn in by Luo Tian’s words. He would rather be hunted all over than stay here, being drained to death every day.

“Of course, kill that Bloodthirsty Ghost. My strength, you just saw it!” Luo Tian spoke loudly. But Ye Chen’s eyes showed disappointment.

Chapter 2111: Bloodthirsty City Lord

“Your strength is strong, but the gap is too big! If you could contact your clan, maybe they could save us!” Ye Chen spoke, his voice full of helplessness.

The other people in the cell also sneered, their faces showing disdain. A mid-stage True Immortal claiming to kill a late-stage True Immortal—such a claim would make people think Luo Tian was mad.

“Don’t believe me. Just don’t cry and beg me to let you out later!” Luo Tian spoke, his gaze fixed on Ye Chen and the three elders.

“If you can save us, I’ll call you grandpa. Think you’re invincible!” The elder spoke loudly in response.

“I don’t have such an old, dirty grandpa. I don’t want one!” Luo Tian frowned.

“Brother, I think we have a good connection. We’re both in the same cell. Once I save you, will you follow me?” Luo Tian showed interest in Ye Chen, ignoring the three elders.

“Don’t think about it. Just focus on how to contact your clan. What you need to do is cultivate and stay alive!” Ye Chen spoke, feeling Luo Tian was strange but not too concerned.

“Brother, I want to tell you… my strength…”

“Say it. If you save me, will you follow me?” Luo Tian kept speaking, spittle flying onto Ye Chen’s face. Ye Chen’s mouth twitched but he didn’t say anything, as his current strength had dropped to half a True Immortal and definitely couldn’t match Luo Tian.

“Once you kill the Bloodthirsty Ghost, I’ll follow you!” Finally Ye Chen’s head was aching. He gave in and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Truly strong, I finally understand why Zheng Xin always talks so much…” Luo Tian sighed internally and, after getting Ye Chen’s answer, stopped talking. He sat on another broken bed.

This elder bullying a new prisoner ended with Luo Tian’s complete victory. However, the three elders sat there, smiling coldly at Luo Tian. He didn’t pay attention and continued adjusting his condition, knowing that a battle would come soon.

Time flowed slowly. The dungeon had no concept of time. Luo Tian could only wait idly.

……

In the black palace, a man in red robes sat there. His face was flushed, his body radiating red light.

“Bring me my food. I’m hungry!” The middle-aged man spoke softly, his voice cold. This was the current city lord of Heavenly Slaughter City—the Bloodthirsty Ghost, known as the Bloodthirsty City Lord. People didn’t know his name.

Huang Bai Shui and the three large-eyed ghosts stood outside the palace, waiting for the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s summons. Their hearts were secretly calculating the time, estimating that the Bloodthirsty Ghost was about to need blood.

“City Lord, we just captured a fresh meal. Please wait a moment; we’ll bring him over!” The large-eyed ghost spoke to the door.

“Fresh meal?” Hearing the large-eyed ghost’s words, the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s eyes lit up slightly. He licked his crimson lips.

“I love fresh meals. Hurry and bring him to me!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost spoke, then sat down.

“Yes!” The large-eyed ghost and the three ghosts felt a slight tremor. Even Huang Bai Shui was nervous, but their faces showed no emotion as they left the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s courtyard and headed toward the prison.

They entered the dungeon under the guards’ respectful gaze. As soon as they arrived, the prisoners became tense.

“Please don’t drink me! Please let me go this time!” Someone fell to the ground, begging desperately.

But more people stood still, their eyes showing excitement. They knew this time it wasn’t them being drained—once a new prisoner arrived, they could avoid some torment.

Soon, Huang Bai Shui and the three ghosts reached the cell where Luo Tian was imprisoned.

“New prisoner, come out!” The large-eyed ghost scolded and pointed his finger. A black inscription dragon flew out, wrapping around Luo Tian.

“Here he comes!” The three elders’ faces showed excitement. This was their first time hoping that Huang Bai Shui would come quickly.

“This time, you’ll lose a layer of skin. When you return, I’ll deal with you!” Seeing Luo Tian bound, the three ghosts secretly smiled. They wanted to let Luo Tian know who was in charge here.

“Wait for me, big brother!” Luo Tian was dragged out by the large-eyed ghost. He spoke to Ye Chen, making Ye Chen’s mouth twitch. Only the elder who had been closed-eyed showed interest in Luo Tian, his eyes looking at him.

“Hurry up!” The large-eyed ghost and the two others pushed Luo Tian roughly, shouting at him to get out of the dungeon.

The four walked pushing Luo Tian through the city. Under the eyes of the city’s ghosts, they pushed him toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s courtyard.

“Did you see that?”

“That’s our catch. A mid-stage True Immortal human, his aura strong!” Halfway through pushing, the large-eyed ghost stopped and shouted to the city’s ghosts.

“Indeed, the large-eyed ghost is so strong!” As soon as the large-eyed ghost’s words finished, a group of ghosts gathered around. Their faces showed flattery.

“I suppose this time the city lord will get many rewards. Such a good catch is rare!” People whispered among themselves.

“That’s not it. You didn’t see who we are, did you? I’ll tell you…” The large-eyed ghost quickly spoke, his spirit lifted. He fabricated a story about capturing Luo Tian, causing people to gasp in amazement. Huang Bai Shui walked toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s courtyard.

“Have they arrived?” The Bloodthirsty Ghost sat there, sensing someone outside. He asked.

“City Lord, please wait a moment. They’re telling the city’s ghosts about capturing this meal to inspire them and get more fresh food for the City Lord!” Huang Bai Shui spoke, following their plan to delay a bit.

“Good. Recently, fresh food has been scarce! If this meal is as you said, the rewards will be plenty. As long as you follow me closely, I’ll consider freeing you within a hundred years,” the Bloodthirsty Ghost nodded and spoke softly.

“Thank you, City Lord!” Huang Bai Shui’s eyes immediately showed gratitude. He took the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s words as nonsense. The large-eyed ghost and others had followed the Bloodthirsty Ghost for years but were still controlled by him.

The large-eyed ghost and the two others took turns telling the story of capturing Luo Tian. Time flowed on, and the Bloodthirsty Ghost finally grew impatient. He truly needed blood to maintain himself, but if he could break through to the Immortal King stage, he could escape this bondage.

There were many Bloodthirsty Ghosts in Hell, but few had grown strong because of this bondage. They needed to drink blood daily; if they didn’t, their strength would weaken. If they went a year without blood, they would die.

Time flowed slowly. The Bloodthirsty Ghost finally grew impatient because he felt a weakening aura. If he didn’t drink blood, his cultivation would drop to late-stage True Immortal.

“Bring the meal here!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s hoarse voice echoed in Huang Bai Shui’s ears, making him tremble slightly.

“Yes!” Huang Bai Shui knew he couldn’t delay any longer. He turned toward the large-eyed ghost and others but moved slowly.

“City Lord needs blood. Let’s go!” Huang Bai Shui approached the three and spoke.

“Yes!” The large-eyed ghost and others nodded. For them, this time was quite torturous; it had been hard to fabricate the story. Even if Huang Bai Shui hadn’t come, they would have struggled to continue.

They walked toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost. Halfway there, they stopped again.

Five people stood still. The large-eyed ghost and the two others trembled. They knew what was coming next, and their hearts were filled with inexplicable fear.

“Damn it, why isn’t he coming!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost was impatient. His mouth felt dry, and his aura slowly dropped. He showed impatience, sending out his spiritual sense to see the five people standing on the street—Luo Tian and the three.

“Da Yan, do you want to die!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost transmitted a mental message to the large-eyed ghost, his voice filled with anger.

“Master, we’re coming!” Hearing the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s furious voice, Da Yan shuddered. He knew if he delayed further, the Bloodthirsty Ghost would come out himself.

After exchanging glances with Luo Tian and others, he pushed Luo Tian again, scolding him as they walked toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s room.

“Strong aura!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost, seated in the room, showed a look of joy. He was particularly sensitive to aura; he could sense who had strong aura.

“After absorbing his blood, I might reach half a step toward the Immortal King. He’s truly the strongest I’ve ever seen!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s breath quickened. He looked at Huang Bai Shui and others pushing Luo Tian toward his courtyard, eyes filled with intense greed.

Under the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s anxious gaze, the four finally pushed Luo Tian to the door of his room. Huang Bai Shui showed a slight worry, then shoved Luo Tian into the room.

“Come here!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost saw Luo Tian enter and immediately opened his mouth to suck. A powerful suction came from the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s mouth.

“Although he is still a late-stage True Immortal, his aura is weaker!” Luo Tian’s vast spiritual sense immediately felt the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s state. His eyes brightened, and he pushed off the ground, rushing toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost.

Luo Tian’s speed was fast. Combined with the suction from the Bloodthirsty Ghost, his speed reached its peak. He instantly appeared in front of the Bloodthirsty Ghost. At the same time, the black inscription on his body shattered. A dark spear appeared in Luo Tian’s hand, rushing toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost.

“Roar…” The Three-Headed Dog and Erhei roared, flying out from in front of Luo Tian. They rushed toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost with Luo Tian.

“This!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s face changed slightly. He felt a powerful pressure descending upon him.

Chapter 2112: Arduous Battle

The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s face changed. He never expected his meal to attack suddenly. Moreover, the three dark divine radiance arrows carried suppression power, leaving him no time to react. He could only raise his hand to block his throat.

“Plop…” At the same time, the black crackling spear reached the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s front and pierced his arm.

A strong resistance blocked Luo Tian’s attack. The crackling spear bent, making Luo Tian’s face change.

The Three-Headed Dog and Erhei also bit into the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s body, tearing off large chunks of flesh.

The ambush was successful. However, the Bloodthirsty Ghost was still a late-stage True Immortal and hadn’t completely dropped to mid-stage.

“Yelling…” A piercing scream echoed through the hall. The Bloodthirsty Ghost screamed, his eyes glowing red. He ignored the spear piercing his arm and slapped the Three-Headed Dog with a palm, sending it flying.

Erhei knew his strength and instantly transformed into the form of a blood-sucking ghost, becoming a cloud of black qi that flew out of the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s attack range.

“Dare to defy me!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost slapped Luo Tian again, his furious palm breaking the void.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed. Three punch shadows overlapped in front of him, meeting the mighty blood palm.

“Boom…” Luo Tian felt his fists hit an iron plate. His body flew backward, colliding with the wall. Cracks spread from behind him.

“Dare to ambush me! A mid-stage True Immortal dares to ambush me. Who gave you the courage!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost knocked Luo Tian away, his eyes fierce. He looked at the blood flowing on the ground and became completely mad.

He pulled out the spear stuck in his arm, then waved his hand, throwing it at Luo Tian to kill him.

“Too strong! Even weakened, he’s still a late-stage True Immortal!” Luo Tian spat out blood. He grabbed the spear with his hand, using the Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique to change its trajectory, sending it into the wall.

“I’ll make you suffer!” Seeing Luo Tian hadn’t died, the Bloodthirsty Ghost showed surprise. His eyes flashed with madness as he moved, becoming a streak of blood toward Luo Tian.

“Heavenly Dragon Unconquered!” Luo Tian roared, casting the Heavenly Dragon Unconquered technique. Two black dragons merged together. The Soul-Controlling Seal suddenly rose, hovering above Luo Tian’s head.

“Roar…” The black punch shadow transformed into a dragon's head, rushing toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost. The Bloodthirsty Ghost also punched out, directly at the black dragon.

“Boom…”, thunderous sounds echoed. The black dragon was constantly shattered by the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s fists.

The Bloodthirsty Ghost advanced like a storm, showing no hesitation as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound shook the sky. Luo Tian’s body became a blur, dodging the blood fist just in time. The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s fist crashed into the wall behind Luo Tian.

Dust spread, and the entire wall was shattered by the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s fist. The scene in the grand palace finally appeared in Huang Bai Shui and others’ sight.

“It’s started!” Huang Bai Shui’s face slightly changed. He looked at the Bloodthirsty Ghost, who was furious. His body emitted a sound of dragons and elephants. The restriction placed in Huang Bai Shui’s body by the Bloodthirsty Ghost shattered, freeing Huang Bai Shui.

The large-eyed ghost and the other two mid-stage True Immortal ghosts also did so. Their eyes showed madness. They knew today’s events couldn’t be hidden from the Bloodthirsty Ghost. If they didn’t kill the Bloodthirsty Ghost, they would die today.

“Kill…” Huang Bai Shui led the charge, transforming into a streak of divine light and rushing toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost.

“You traitors!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost was chasing Luo Tian when he felt the wind behind him. He suddenly turned around and saw Huang Bai Shui and the large-eyed ghost rushing toward him.

“Die! Daring to betray me!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost raised his hands, forming an incantation. This was the incantation that controlled their bodies.

As soon as the incantation fell, Huang Bai Shui and the others seemed unaffected. The Bloodthirsty Ghost knew they had escaped his control.

A yellow hand fell from the sky. A red eye shot out a red beam. Huang Bai Shui and the others immediately used their martial arts to attack the Bloodthirsty Ghost.

“Do you dare to kill me!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s eyes showed ferocity. He stood still and pressed his hands, slamming them onto the ground.

“Rustle…”, a vast sea of blood surged from the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s hands, spreading outward. It collided with the martial arts of Huang Bai Shui and others instantly.

The martial arts were immediately submerged by the blood sea, making no ripples. This left Luo Tian, who had caught his breath, in awe.

“A late-stage True Immortal is truly powerful. We definitely couldn’t match him!” Luo Tian muttered internally. If it weren’t for his ultimate-level cultivation, the Soul-Controlling Seal, and the pressure from the Three-Headed Dog and Erhei on ghosts, he might have already been killed by the Bloodthirsty Ghost.

Luo Tian had previously killed a late-stage True Immortal, but that was an ambush. If it were a real confrontation, the late-stage True Immortal would have escaped. If it were a human’s late-stage True Immortal, they might even be able to kill one or two.

The thunderous sound attracted many ghosts from the Heavenly Slaughter City. Their faces showed shock, looking at the battlefield.

“That’s Huang Bai Shui, the leader! That’s a human, just captured!” The ghosts immediately recognized Luo Tian and others. Their eyes showed disbelief.

“They’re surrounding the City Lord!” Soon, many ghosts saw the Bloodthirsty Ghost standing in the center of the blood sea, his aura overwhelming.

“Dare to defy? A few mid-stage True Immortals dare to surround a late-stage True Immortal!” The people felt the absurdity of Luo Tian and others’ actions.

“Boom…” The Bloodthirsty Ghost broke through the blood sea, instantly rushing toward Huang Bai Shui. He punched out.

Before the Bloodthirsty Ghost appeared in front of him, Huang Bai Shui had already cast an incantation. A yellow stream of water appeared and was shattered by the Bloodthirsty Ghost, then reformed in front of everyone.

“Dare to betray me. You all must die!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s furious voice echoed. He stepped forward and appeared in front of a mid-stage True Immortal ghost, grabbing its neck with one hand. He twisted it, and a crackling sound echoed. Black qi flickered as the ghost was strangled.

“Do you see? This is your final fate. I’ll kill each of you one by one!” The Bloodthirsty Ghost’s face showed ferocity. He rushed toward another mid-stage True Immortal ghost and the large-eyed ghost.

“Hum…” The large-eyed ghost trembled. His two eyes suddenly changed, glowing red and forming a red net that wrapped around the Bloodthirsty Ghost.

The red light net instantly made the Bloodthirsty Ghost stop. His eyes became even more ferocious, and he continuously swung his fists. The void constantly shattered under the Bloodthirsty Ghost’s punches, and the red light net also gradually lost its luster.

“Hurry! He entered the illusion. I can’t hold on much longer!” The large-eyed ghost’s eyes continuously flowed black blood, and he trembled constantly.
