But at this moment, the disciples and elders of Yomingsong Sect had their eyes red with fury. Years ago, that woman had severed the Yomingsong Mountains with a single sword, which had already enraged the sect's disciples. Now, someone dared to stand above Yomingsong Sect—moreover, it was a disciple from the Northern Region's Five Elements Sect.

"Let this little bastard see what happens when he lacks strength but still acts arrogant!" the Yomingsong Sect disciples roared, charging toward...

"Father, go stabilize the disciples. Don't let them clash with Luo Tian!" Shangguan Hongtu's face showed great alarm. His figure flickered, flying toward the back mountains of Yomingsong Sect. At the same time, he pressed his waist's jade token, beginning to contact Yomingsong Sect's various ancestral elders.

The disciples of Yomingsong Sect surged into the sect's square, their eyes burning with anger as they gazed at Luo Tian and his companions hovering in the sky.

Several elders of the Ritual Soul Stage bore cold killing intent on their faces. Due to Luo Tian's possession of the Nourishing Soul Jade, people couldn't discern his cultivation level. Yet instinctively, they sensed Luo Tian's strength was around the Ritual Soul Stage.

What terrified them was that Gu Qianxue and others by Luo Tian's side all radiated the Consolidated Spirit Stage. Their presence left people stunned.

"Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian! Why have you come to Yomingsong Sect?" Shangguan Hui, Luo Tian's father and current sect master of Yomingsong Sect, bore a wary expression as he gazed at Luo Tian and his companions in the sky.

Especially when seeing their young faces, he was shaken to his core. As Yomingsong Sect's master, Shangguan Hui's strength was beyond question—he had reached the Consolidated Spirit Stage's initial phase. Yet Luo Tian's companions, even the weakest among them, possessed Consolidated Spirit Stage strength. This left Shangguan Hui deeply shaken.

Shangguan Feihong's face also shifted slightly; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to have such formidable companions.

"Qianxue, come down! Have you forgotten your identity?" When Shangguan Feihong saw Gu Qianxue standing before Luo Tian, his face darkened.

"Gu Qianxue? Gu Lei? Aren't they Yomingsong Sect's prodigies? Didn't Shangguan Elder bring them back?" The Yomingsong Sect disciples murmured, their faces filled with confusion. They couldn't fathom why their sect's prodigies would stand before another.

"Old Shangguan!" Gu Lei's face darkened as he gazed at Shangguan Feihong, recalling how Shangguan Feihong and his two companions had dominated in Tianyuan City. He remembered how Tian Bo had been injured by them and how Luo Tian had spat blood.

Gu Qianxue's eyes also held icy killing intent, but she gazed at Luo Tian with the tenderness of a wife toward her husband.

"Old Shangguan, do you remember what happened in Tianyuan City? Now I've come to settle your heart's burden. These years, did you long to kill me so desperately that you've gone mad? Now I've come to you willingly—shouldn't you be happy?" Luo Tian's face bore killing intent as he gazed at Shangguan Feihong. In Luo Tian's eyes, the three brothers—Shangguan Feihong, Shangguan Qingyu, and Shangguan Qingfeng—had to die today.

"What's going on?" Shangguan Hui's face bore confusion as he gazed at Shangguan Feihong. It was he who had dispatched Shangguan Feihong and his two companions to Tianyuan City to retrieve Gu Qianxue and others. Yet Shangguan Hui's order had been to treat the Gu family with courtesy.

Clearly, based on Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's expressions, the situation hadn't been as Shangguan Hui had imagined. These years, as Yomingsong Sect's master, Shangguan Hui hadn't interfered with Gu Qianxue's affairs. When Shangguan Hongtu had returned from the Northern Region, he'd only possessed a soul—Shangguan Hui had thus harbored resentment toward Luo Tian and the Five Elements Sect. Yet he hadn't known of Gu Qianxue's relationship with Luo Tian.

These years, Shangguan Hui hadn't expected this despised little man to have grown so formidable. As a Consolidated Spirit Stage powerhouse, Shangguan Hui could sense the immense aura radiating from Luo Tian.

Considering Shangguan Hongtu's earlier words, Shangguan Hui's gaze toward Luo Tian grew even more solemn.

"What are you, that you dare to insult Elder Shangguan?"
"Exactly! Do you think you can run rampant in the Northern Region and then do the same here?"
"Kid, do you know that the Northern Region is like a rural backwater to Yomingsong Sect? You're just a country bumpkin!" Before Shangguan Feihong and Shangguan Hui could speak further, the Yomingsong Sect disciples roared.

"Gu Qianxue! Gu Lei! These years, Yomingsong Sect has truly wasted its efforts on you. You two traitors! Today I'll show you the fate of betraying Yomingsong Sect!" Shangguan Feihong's face bore a grotesque expression. These years, his restraint over Gu Qianxue had finally snapped.

"Life-and-Death Seal!" Shangguan Feihong's face twisted with grotesque joy. His hand flicked, and a strange mark emerged from his palm—yet it held no power.

This mark floated toward Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue, a seal designed to activate the hidden restrictions within their bodies. If struck, they would suffer unbearable agony—a unique method of Yomingsong Sect to prevent betrayal.

Even though Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei had reached the Consolidated Spirit Stage, the Life-and-Death Seal would still make them suffer.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's eyes flashed with mockery, yet they didn't dodge. They waited as the two strange marks approached them.

"Did you think you could escape?" Shangguan Feihong's lips curled into a smile, waiting for their desperate pleas.

"Ah…" The mark touched them, and Gu Qianxue stood calmly, while Gu Lei clutched his head, rolling in midair.

Chapter 686: Coward?

Chapter 686: Coward?

Seeing Gu Lei rolling in the sky, Xu Lizi and others were startled. Even Luo Tian was taken aback, silently cursing himself for having already removed Gu Lei's restrictions. Why was he still like this?

"Ah…" Gu Lei clutched his head, sweat pouring down his face as he cried out in agony.

"Ha! Kid, how does it feel? Not so pleasant, is it?" Shangguan Feihong's face curled into a sneer. Though surprised that Gu Qianxue remained unharmed, he didn't care much—after all, Shangguan Hongtu had favored Gu Qianxue. Perhaps he'd already removed the restrictions in the Xiangu Ruins.

"Come here and kneel to me, and I'll spare you!" Shangguan Feihong's face bore endless arrogance as he addressed Gu Lei.

"Zhen…" Luo Tian moved his feet slightly, instantly appearing before Gu Lei. He reached out and felt that Gu Lei's body was normal, with no signs of energy chaos.

"I…" Gu Lei trembled as he spoke, shoving Luo Tian away and gazing at Shangguan Feihong.

"I… I…"

"I said come kneel to me! Didn't you hear?" Shangguan Feihong's eyes held a mocking glint as he surveyed Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue.

"Ah…" Gu Lei clutched his head again, as if unable to endure it, crying out toward Shangguan Feihong. His face was flushed with veins popping.

"Even if you've reached Consolidated Spirit Stage, you still came crawling!" Shangguan Feihong spoke softly, his gaze sweeping over Gu Lei's pale face.

"Kneel down! I'll let you recover!" Shangguan Hongtu stood there, his voice cold.

"I…"

"I beg your grandfather, old dog!" A cold voice echoed in Shangguan Feihong's ears. In the next moment, a streak of violet energy surrounded Shangguan Feihong. A fist, brimming with wind, smashed toward him.

The sudden scene stunned everyone. No one expected Gu Lei—once so desperate—to strike instantly.

"Crack…" Gu Lei had now reached the Consolidated Spirit Stage's initial phase, while Shangguan Feihong was only at Ritual Soul Stage's middle. In Gu Lei's presence, Shangguan Feihong was like a child—Gu Lei's fist shattered his ribs in an instant, sending him flying backward with blood spewing from his mouth. His face was filled with disbelief.

Gu Lei's speed had been too fast for anyone to react. Moreover, his performance had been so convincing that even Luo Tian and the others had been deceived.

After knocking Shangguan Feihong away, Gu Lei didn't stop. His body transformed into a streak of violet light, appearing before Shangguan Feihong and lifting him up. He returned to Luo Tian's group.

"My acting was perfect, wasn't it?" Gu Lei smiled, gazing at Luo Tian and the others as he laughed. His face bore a triumphant expression.

"Brother, this move was flawless! Even we were deceived!" Tian Luo and Xu Lizi approached Gu Lei, their faces filled with admiration.

"Old man, I didn't expect you to have this day!" Gu Lei's face bore mockery as he lifted Shangguan Feihong, his voice laced with sarcasm.

Shangguan Feihong was still in shock, his mind unable to process Gu Lei's speed.

"Gu Lei! Release my grandfather!" Shangguan Qingyu and his brother's faces bore anger as they gazed at Gu Lei in the sky.

"Release? You once wanted me to suffer, and now I'm releasing you? Remember Yomingsong Sect's principle—revenge for grudges, right? How should I avenge you?" Gu Lei's voice was mocking as he gazed at Shangguan Qingyu.

"Old man, you once nearly killed Tian Bo. How should I repay you?" Gu Lei's face darkened as he poured various colored pills into Shangguan Feihong's mouth.

"Toxic…" The Yomingsong Sect disciples saw Gu Lei's actions, their faces changing. Their gazes trembled with fear.

Gu Lei's poison was unparalleled in Yomingsong Sect. Now, with so many toxic pills poured into one person's body, the disciples couldn't imagine what Shangguan Feihong would become.

"Smack!" Gu Lei let out a cold snort, smashing Shangguan Feihong's dantian with one palm. His gaze challenged Shangguan Qingyu and his brother.

At this moment, without the sect's elders, Yomingsong Sect's disciples and elders combined would never be a match for these dozens of people.

"Gu Lei!"

"Luo Tian, you said you wanted to settle the score from before. Why don't you do it yourself? Are you afraid of being a coward again, hiding behind Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei?" Shangguan Qingyu's face bore mockery as he directed his words at Luo Tian.

"Uh…"

"Fool!" Seeing Shangguan Qingyu's mocking gaze, Xu Lizi and others smiled inwardly, cursing silently.

"Ha!" Luo Tian stood in the sky, gazing at Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng as if looking at clowns.

"You dare to make me do it?" Luo Tian spoke, his voice calm.

"Did you say 'dare'? You're too afraid to act on your own, aren't you? Back then, I beat you like a dog. If it weren't for Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's intercession, do you think you'd be alive now?" Shangguan Qingfeng still spoke arrogantly, his words filled with contempt.

"Fine, since that's the case, I'll definitely settle the score from before! Both of you come at me!" Don't think I'm giving you a chance.

"Arrogant fool! We could make you crawl before, and we can do it again!" Shangguan Qingfeng waved his hand, a sword appearing in it. His gaze at Luo Tian was filled with killing intent.

"Come!" Luo Tian said nothing, but his aura surged into the sky like a king's. He extended his hand, and a powerful suction force emerged from it.

In the next moment, Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng were flying toward Luo Tian under the stunned gazes of Yomingsong Sect disciples.

"Consolidated Spirit Stage! Damn it, among this group, the one with the lowest cultivation isn't this kid. This kid is actually the strongest!" Shangguan Hui's face darkened, realizing that Luo Tian and his group's strength far exceeded his expectations.

Within a breath, Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng stood before Luo Tian. Only then did they realize his cultivation level, their faces changing drastically. They tried to resist but found themselves unable to even think of fighting back under Luo Tian's Consolidated Spirit Stage middle-level aura.

"I've always said, my things aren't easy to snatch!" Luo Tian chuckled, flicking his finger. In that flick, Shangguan Qingfeng's shoulder shattered instantly, blood spewing from both of their shoulders.

Chapter 687: Killing Shangguan

On the Tianyuan Continent's Southern Region, Yomingsong Sect's sky, Luo Tian stood calmly. Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng's faces were filled with panic.

At this moment, the two felt their hearts tremble to the core. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to have grown so formidable. In his presence, they felt like ants with no ability to resist.

The Yomingsong Sect disciples' faces bore anger. Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng were Yomingsong Sect's prodigies, and Shangguan Feihong was also a heavy-weight elder. To be humiliated like this, how could the high-and-mighty Yomingsong Sect disciples accept it?

"Have the guts to kill me! Kill me, and you'll die with me!" Shangguan Qingfeng still remained defiant.

"You really have character, but do you think I'll let you die so easily? I remember you've assassinated me more than once!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

As he finished speaking, Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng's other shoulders turned into mist, scattering into the world.

"Luo Tian, don't be too bold. They are my Yomingsong Sect's people. Your actions might bring trouble to the Five Elements Sect!" Shangguan Hui could no longer sit still, his face filled with anger as he flew into the sky.

"Go… you're not a good one!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and a gust of wind surged from him, sending Shangguan Hui back a hundred feet.

"Lu Xian, don't think we Yomingsong Sect have no people! If Shangguan Hongtu were here, he would definitely kill you!" The Yomingsong Sect disciples' faces turned red with anger.

These years, when had Yomingsong Sect suffered such humiliation? To be confronted and killed by a group of people on their own territory.

"By the way, where is Shangguan Hongtu?" The Yomingsong Sect disciples brought up Shangguan Hongtu, their faces flashing with light.

"Yes! We still have Shangguan Hongtu!" The Yomingsong Sect disciples erupted, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian.

"Kid, your Shangguan Hongtu must have been scared and run away!" Xu Lizi sneered, looking at the Yomingsong Sect disciples with a look of contempt.

"Smack!" Luo Tian didn't care about the Yomingsong Sect disciples' shouting. He waved his hand, and Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng exploded into a blood mist under the Yomingsong Sect disciples' furious gazes.

Luo Tian's power was well-controlled. He grabbed their souls with one hand, covering them in green flames.

"Ah…" The screams echoed from the two gray souls, leaving people stunned.

Shangguan Hui's face turned completely dark, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian with coldness. "It seems you really want to fight me and Yomingsong Sect to the death!"

"To the death? Ha! Do you think that's what will happen? If it were to the death, your elders would have already come out and surrounded us!" Luo Tian's face bore mockery. He burned the two souls to a thread, then with one punch, sent them into the reincarnation passage.

"Kid, don't be too bold!" As Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng's souls were about to enter the reincarnation passage, a voice echoed. Three elders with angry faces appeared in people's sight.

The three elders arrived, extending their hands to try and retrieve the two souls about to enter the reincarnation passage.

"Ha! Three Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders dare to interfere with me?" Luo Tian's face curled into a sneer. He slapped his hand toward them.

A violent aura surged from Luo Tian's palm, blocking the force they sent out. At the same time, Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng's two souls were completely sucked into the reincarnation passage.

"You!" The three Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders' faces darkened, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian. A killing aura formed around them.

"I've already given Yomingsong Sect face. If not for that, those three wouldn't even have a chance at reincarnation!" Luo Tian took a step forward, facing the three Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders without fear.

"You dare to touch me?" Luo Tian's face bore a slight smile, his voice still calm. At the same time, Xu Lizi and others stood behind Luo Tian, their auras surging into the sky. Their gazes held mockery.

"You three aren't enough to dare touch me!" Luo Tian extended his hand, a hand of energy flying out. It grabbed the still-crying and decaying Shangguan Feihong, smashing him into the disappearing reincarnation passage.

"Luo Tian, there's no need for this! Don't be impulsive!" As the tension escalated, a hurried voice echoed into everyone's ears. The Yomingsong Sect disciples' faces lit up with joy.

"Shangguan Hongtu!"

"Haha, kid, you're done! Shangguan Hongtu has arrived. Even if you are Consolidated Spirit Stage middle-level, it's still no good!" The Yomingsong Sect disciples roared mockingly, their gazes filled with contempt toward Luo Tian.

The sound of breaking through the sky echoed. Two figures appeared in people's sight, causing Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei to tremble slightly.

"Mother!" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei shouted, their faces filled with excitement as they gazed at a woman's figure before Shangguan Hongtu.

"Qianxue, Lei!" The woman's face bore joy as she gazed at Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, her eyes also filled with excitement.

Luo Tian overheard Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's conversation, then began to scrutinize the woman. Her cultivation was at the peak of Yuanling, not particularly high but still no ordinary feat. Her appearance wasn't remarkable, perhaps due to age. If she were younger, Luo Tian would have definitely called her a beauty.

"Ah! It's true—she really looks like Gu Qianxue!" Xu Lizi and others sighed.

"Shangguan Hongtu, be sensible and let my mother go. Otherwise, today it's death!" Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue's faces bore icy killing intent as they gazed at Shangguan Hongtu.

"Two of you, don't be hasty. I brought your mother here. I won't harm her. I brought her here for no other reason than to let you reunite!" Shangguan Hongtu looked at Luo Tian, then smiled kindly toward Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei as they approached.

"Smart choice!" Gu Qianxue snorted, pulling the woman to her side with a happy expression.

Although Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei were in Yomingsong Sect, they rarely saw Shangguan Feiyany. Each time they met her, it wasn't easy.

"Mother, this time we're going home!" Gu Qianxue pulled Shangguan Feiyany's hand, and together with Gu Lei, they flew toward Luo Tian.

"Hmph! Rebels who don't pay the price want to leave?" But as the three flew, a Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders' cold voice echoed. His old hand extended, and a strange mark flew toward Shangguan Feiyany.

Chapter 688: Powerful Connections

"Life-and-Death Seal!" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's faces slightly startled, then looked toward Luo Tian with pleading eyes.

"Damn it! I forgot about this!" Shangguan Hongtu was stunned, his face filled with regret. He silently cursed these old men for being so foolish.

The Yomingsong Sect disciples had initially been confused by Shangguan Hongtu's politeness toward Luo Tian, but in the next moment, they felt a blur as something touched Shangguan Feiyany.

"Ah…" Shangguan Feiyany's face turned painful as the mark touched her. Cold sweat immediately rolled down her face.

"Die!" Luo Tian's eyes turned icy, and in the next moment, he appeared before Shangguan Feiyany. His hand pressed a strange mark into her body with his碧green flames.

After this, Luo Tian's face bore endless coldness. He stepped the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven, forming seven shadows. Instantly, he appeared before the Yomingsong Sect elder who had acted, and launched a punch of destruction.

The Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven was the secret technique of the Yuling Sect. Now, with Luo Tian at Consolidated Spirit Stage middle-level, even a Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders couldn't react quickly.

The Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders felt a strong danger the moment Luo Tian moved and immediately prepared for defense.

"An ordinary Consolidated Spirit Stage middle-level person dares to come into my Yomingsong Sect and attack me. Today I'll teach you on behalf of the Five Elements Sect's elders!" The Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders thought, his aura surging into the sky.

But before the elder's aura reached its peak, Luo Tian's punch of destruction had already smashed into his chest with a thunderous sound.

"Smack…" Like a heavy thunder, Luo Tian's punch smashed into the elder's chest.

"What?" The other two Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders' faces bore a hint of surprise, not expecting Luo Tian's speed to be so fast.

The Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders' body flew backward, his face also filled with disbelief.

As a high-and-mighty elder of Yomingsong Sect, for years he had never suffered such humiliation. Being knocked back by a junior, his face felt unbearable, and he couldn't help but roar, preparing to attack Luo Tian.

"Old man, do you dare fight me?" Luo Tian's face bore a mocking smile, his expression filled with endless coldness.

"Kid, Yomingsong Sect isn't a place for you to run wild. Now submit and it's still timely!" The other two Enders' faces bore a cold gaze toward Luo Tian.

At this point, reconciliation was obviously impossible. It was better to be strong and establish an image that Yomingsong Sect's people couldn't be bullied.

"Respect the elders!" Indeed, as soon as the elder's words were spoken, the Yomingsong Sect disciples' faces lit up with fervor and they shouted loudly.

"Three elders, Luo Tian! Don't be impulsive!" Shangguan Hongtu's face bore a bitter smile as he spoke.

"Be quiet! Look at your current state—what kind of prodigy image do you have?" Hearing Shangguan Hongtu's words, the three elders' faces turned angry.

"Enough talking! Come on, I'll see what a Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders can do to me!" Luo Tian's battle spirit was fierce. He gazed at the three elders, interrupting their scolding of Shangguan Hongtu.

"Capture him!" The three elders, seeing Luo Tian's arrogance, could no longer control their anger. Their auras surged and they flew toward Luo Tian.

"Haha, I didn't expect Yomingsong Sect to resort to bullying! Luo Tian, let me take one!" Tian Luo laughed and spoke, not waiting for Luo Tian's agreement. His body transformed into a meteor and flew toward one elder.

"I want one too… let me have one!" Seeing Tian Luo took the lead, others' faces bore battle spirit and they rushed toward the three elders.

"Stop!" Just as they were about to collide, a furious voice echoed, causing everyone's bodies to pause slightly.

Luo Tian and others' faces bore solemn expressions as they gazed at the void.

"Rip…" The void tore open, and an old man with white hair appeared, his face cold. Behind him stood seven Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders.

"This is Yomingsong Sect's true strength! One who has mastered chaos energy at Consolidated Spirit Stage peak, and seven Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders!" Luo Tian silently sighed, admiring Yomingsong Sect's power.

"You are Luo Tian?" The elder's eyes were like lightning, gazing at Luo Tian and scrutinizing him.

"Yes," Luo Tian slightly bowed his head. For an elder at Consolidated Spirit Stage peak who had mastered a bit of chaos energy, Luo Tian still didn't dare to resist.

At the moment the elder appeared, Luo Tian knew today's fight wouldn't happen. The issue now was how to wrap it up.

"Apologize to me, and this matter will be settled!" The elder didn't ask about the details but directly spoke his conditions.

"This…" The three elders who wanted to fight Luo Tian and the Yomingsong Sect disciples' faces bore great surprise, gazing at the elder in the sky. They hadn't expected Luo Tian's wild behavior in Yomingsong Sect to be so simple as an apology.

"Respectfully, I have no fault. Why should I apologize?" Luo Tian's voice was resolute as he spoke softly.

Luo Tian's words echoed clearly in people's ears, leaving them stunned again. They hadn't expected this kid to refuse the opportunity to back down.

"You dare to touch me?" Luo Tian spoke softly, waving his hand. The sky instantly filled with countless jade pendants.

"What do you mean?" That elder asked, his expression puzzled as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"I am the Young Master of the Five Elements Sect, and also the Young Master of Yuling Sect in the East. Moreover, I am the Young Master of the Ice Extreme Island in the South! I also have good relations with the beasts of the Northern Region's Great An Forest!" Luo Tian spoke calmly.

"If I were to suffer any harm in Yomingsong Sect today, do you believe that tomorrow countless beasts and the strength of three sects would come to attack Yomingsong Sect?" Luo Tian stood in the sky, his gaze filled with contempt as he looked at the elder behind him.

"Moreover, I have a life-and-death friendship with Jin Wulong, the Young Master of the South's Seal Demon Sect. I am also a sworn brother with the Young Masters of the East's Dan Sect, Tianjian Sect, and Fengfeng Valley. And there's also..." Luo Tian stood in the sky, reciting a list of sect names.

Chapter 689: I'm Leaving, Who Dares to Stop Me?

Hearing Luo Tian calmly standing in the sky and reciting a list of sect names, each time he spoke one, the three Consolidated Spirit Stage Enders' faces grew more solemn.

"Is he telling the truth?" The elder's face showed no emotion, gazing at Shangguan Hongtu on the ground.

Shangguan Hongtu's face bore a bitter smile, nodding to the elder. He remembered Luo Tian's terrifying influence in the Xiangu Ruins.

As Shangguan Hongtu nodded, the atmosphere of Yomingsong Sect grew somber. They gazed at Luo Tian's calmness and felt the terror of his connections.

"I'm standing here—dare you kill me?" Luo Tian's voice echoed like a cold wind from the nine hells, entering everyone's ears.

"Yes! With such terrifying identity, dare Yomingsong Sect kill him?" The Yomingsong Sect disciples finally regained their senses.

Although Yomingsong Sect was one of the top sects in the Southern Region, could it withstand an alliance of most sects across Tianyuan Continent?

Not to mention other sects, just one Great An Forest and three major sects in the East—if they joined forces to attack Yomingsong Sect, it would be unable to withstand.

The ten Consolidated Spirit Stage elders of Yomingsong Sect, who had been angry before, now gradually calmed down. They glared at Luo Tian with gritted teeth.

"Respected elder, if there's nothing else, I'll be leaving!" Luo Tian smiled faintly and nodded to Gu Qianxue and others.

"Go! This is the only time. If there's another, it'll be a complete destruction!" The elder's face remained calm but he gazed at Luo Tian deeply before vanishing from the spot.

"Yomingsong Sect, starting today, Shangguan Hongtu will be the sect master!" After the elder vanished, a deep voice echoed from the void, causing Yomingsong Sect's disciples to tremble slightly.

"This era belongs to you!" Shangguan Hui, hearing the elder's voice, bore a gentle smile. His gaze softened toward Shangguan Hongtu.

Today's performance of Shangguan Hongtu had made Shangguan Hui realize that his son, once a spoiled brat, had grown up.

"Shangguan Hongtu, goodbye! See you again during the battle with the Tianshi Sect!" Luo Tian's face bore a sigh, recalling how he had nearly killed Shangguan Hongtu before. At that time, Shangguan Hongtu had been a typical spoiled brat like Zhang Daotian in his youth. Now, Shangguan Hongtu had grown up and was capable of shouldering Yomingsong Sect.

"Goodbye!" Shangguan Hongtu also sighed, gazing at Luo Tian and others' retreating figures.

...

Luo Tian and his group tore through the void, disappearing from Yomingsong Sect's direction toward Jinyu City. Luo Tian knew that after such a long time, the teleportation array had been fully repaired, so they didn't want to waste time on the journey.

On the way, Gu Qianxue introduced Luo Tian to her mother Shangguan Feiyany. Naturally, Shangguan Feiyany was satisfied with Luo Tian.

After half a day's journey, they arrived at Jinyu City and passed through the teleportation array to the Northern Region.

Just as Luo Tian and his group stepped onto the teleportation array, three terrifying auras appeared in Jinyu City's sky.

"Kid, you flew fast, but what does it matter if you're back in the Northern Region?" Three elders' faces bore icy killing intent.

Luo Tian and his group, however, didn't know they had been targeted. At this moment, they were already in the Northern Region.

"Northern Region! I'm back, hahaha!" Gu Lei's face bore laughter as he stood outside the newly renovated Feiyan City, shouting loudly. His face held a touch of nostalgia.

Gu Qianxue and her mother Shangguan Feiyany also bore nostalgia, especially Shangguan Feiyany. She hadn't been to the Northern Region in years. Now, standing under the Northern Region's sky, her eyes even had tears glistening.

"Mother, soon you'll see your father. Are you happy?" Gu Qianxue's face bore a rare playful expression as she gazed at Shangguan Feiyany.

"You little brat!" Shangguan Feiyany glared at Gu Qianxue, her face filled with anticipation.

"Get down! Can't you be quiet for a while!" Wang Yulan's face bore coldness as she kicked Gu Lei down.

"Gee, I'm coming down! I was just excited!" Gu Lei scratched his head, clinging stubbornly to Wang Yulan's front.

Luo Tian gazed at this scene with a sense of emotion, his gaze softening.

"These people—I'll protect them! Even if it means dying!" Luo Tian's gaze bore a determined expression, vowing silently.

A group of over ten people, chatting and laughing, became a streak of light toward the Five Elements Sect.

Their longing for home made them return to the Five Elements Sect in a single day, causing a commotion.

"Little bastard! Who let you leave?" The sect's master Wei Mingxuan and Lu Kunpeng appeared at the Five Elements Sect's mountain gate, their faces devoid of joy but filled with anger.

"Master!" Gu Lei's eyes bore excitement as he gazed at Wu Taiping in the sky, flying toward him and kneeling.

Gu Qianxue also flew up, heading toward Mu Feng's peak master, Mu Nianqing.

"Master, your kindness is appreciated, but if the Five Elements Sect no longer exists, what's the point of us living?" Lei Yong smiled and spoke to Wei Mingxuan.

Zhang Ziping's brows furrowed slightly, then relaxed again. His gaze held a touch of gentleness as he glanced at Luo Tian and the others.

"Since you've returned, come back! I knew these kids weren't that easy to fool!" Zhang Ziping mediated, speaking to Wei Mingxuan and others.

Then, Wei Mingxuan and others felt Luo Tian's group's strength, their minds shaking. They hadn't expected them to reach the Consolidated Spirit Stage so quickly. This rate of improvement was truly terrifying.

Zhang Ziping himself was only at the Consolidated Spirit Stage's initial phase, while Wei Mingxuan was even worse—Ritual Soul Stage's peak. This was because Zhang Daotian had returned once to boost their strength. Otherwise, it wasn't clear if they could even reach the Ritual Soul Stage now.

Seeing the situation was irreparable, Wei Mingxuan and Lu Kunpeng had no choice but to accept the reality and led Luo Tian's group into the Five Elements Sect.

After gathering, Luo Tian learned about the current state of the Five Elements Sect, causing his heart to tighten slightly.

The Five Elements Sect now had a million disciples, still mostly at the Cultivation Body Stage. Although high-level combat strength like the peak masters of each mountain had reached the Ritual Soul Stage, Zhang Ziping had even entered the Consolidated Spirit Stage. The five elders were at the Consolidated Spirit Stage's peak. Yet, to Luo Tian, this was still far from enough.

Chapter 690: Warmth of the Gu Family

The Five Elements Sect was now stronger than before, but compared to the power Tianshi Sect had shown in Xiangu Continent, it was still like a small house against a big one. Its overall strength was as insignificant as an ant.

"I see I need to boost the Five Elements Sect's strength again, at least up to Yomingsong Sect's level!" Luo Tian silently calculated the time. The deadline set by his grandfather Lu Xiong was approaching, and he felt increasingly urgent.
