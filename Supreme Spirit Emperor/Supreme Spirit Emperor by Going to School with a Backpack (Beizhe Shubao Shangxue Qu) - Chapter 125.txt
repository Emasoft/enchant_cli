Luo Tian chuckled bitterly as he recounted the aftereffects of the Blazing Soul Technique to Zheng Xin.

"Ah... I wonder how everyone else is doing! For the next few days, just stay put," Zheng Xin said, admonishing Luo Tian.

"That's not possible. It's such a rare opportunity to have this identity; if I don't make use of it, it would be wasted!" Luo Tian's face broke into a smile.

"Uh... you're right," Zheng Xin's eyes gleamed slightly upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

The next morning, Zheng Xin arrived early at Luo Tian's mansion. The two hurriedly made their way to the Martial Skills Pavilion, spending two days there before entering the Elixir Hall, the Talisman Hall, and the Artifice Workshop...

Before long, they had spent over ten days exploring every resource hub of the Tian Dao Sect under Zhang Daotian's identity, taking whatever they could.

One day, as the two exited the place where Tian Dao Sect stored spiritual herbs, their faces bore expressions of frustration.

"Damn it, I can't take them even though I can see them!" Zheng Xin gazed longingly at the grand hall filled with spiritual herbs, lamenting.

"Buzz..." Just as Zheng Xin's words finished, a displacement force surged beneath Luo Tian's feet, and his figure vanished from the spot.

Luo Tian sighed softly, appearing in Si Tuchen's cave dwelling, his face carrying a respectful expression.

"Master!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Si Tuchen's aged face. He noticed a coldness on Si Tuchen's countenance.

"Hmph..." Upon seeing Luo Tian, Si Tuchen's coldness softened into a warm smile.

"You've been quite the troublemaker these past days! Did you come to see me?" Si Tuchen's voice carried a reprimand.

"Uh..." Luo Tian was taken aback, gazing at Si Tuchen. At that moment, Si Tuchen hardly seemed like a master of the Convergence Soul realm; instead, he resembled an elderly person longing for his children to return home.

Luo Tian's heart stirred unexpectedly, and he bowed slightly: "It was my mistake, Master!"

"Enough with the act. Today I called you here to tell you something!" Si Tuchen, seeing Luo Tian's obedient expression, shook his head and chuckled lightly.

"Do you remember the Yao Biyue from the Questioning Heart Sect?" Si Tuchen began to explain.

After hearing Si Tuchen's words, Luo Tian's face turned stunned, then shook his head like a sesame seed. He recalled Yao Biyue's image from Zhang Daotian's memories, his lips twitching involuntarily.

In truth, when Zhang Daotian was ten years old, Si Tuchen had already arranged a marriage for him—not to make Luo Tian too stubborn but to secure a powerful ally.

The Questioning Heart Sect was one of the twelve sects on Xian Gu Continent. Though weaker than Tian Dao Sect and the Dark God Temple, it was still a formidable ally.

Yao Biyue was an apprentice of a senior master in the Questioning Heart Sect, possessing formidable strength. The marriage alliance between the two sects was naturally welcomed; they reached an agreement swiftly.

However, over time, Zhang Daotian's reputation as a prodigal son was well-known across the twelve sects. Meanwhile, Yao Biyue had become a prodigy of the Questioning Heart Sect, gaining fame among the younger generation. Their marriage contract was seen as a flower planted on cow dung.

Chapter 612: Breaking the Engagement

"Nothing's wrong! The wife I found for you is your wife!" Si Tuchen's face flashed with fury, roaring in his cave dwelling. The sound shook the outer disciples of the sect.

Luo Tian chuckled and said softly, "Master, if they want to break off the engagement, just agree! Why make everyone uncomfortable?"

"Breaking the engagement? With me around, I'll see who dares to break it! If they dare, I'll storm the Questioning Heart Sect and stir up a commotion!"

"Also, you! Boy, I found you a wife—now you're being picky? Do you think your wings are strong enough now? You'll marry her, or I'll break your legs and force you to!" Si Tuchen's eyes burned with anger as he addressed Luo Tian.

Luo Tian inwardly sighed at the old man's stubbornness and pitied Zhang Daotian. Si Tuchen was fine in every aspect, but he never interfered with Zhang Daotian's affairs—except this one matter, where he had no room for negotiation.

When Luo Tian first heard about the marriage contract, a bad premonition arose. As Si Tuchen's explanation continued, Luo Tian gradually understood that the Questioning Heart Sect believed Zhang Daotian was unworthy of Yao Biyue and intended to dissolve the contract.

They had already sent a message to Si Tuchen, which was why he was so furious—hence Luo Tian's initial encounter with his icy gaze.

Naturally, Luo Tian was delighted at the prospect of breaking off the engagement. Not only did it resolve issues with Gu Qianxue and Chen Yuting, but Zhang Daotian himself would find it hard to accept. Though Luo Tian knew this world wasn't real, a mental barrier remained: that woman was his master's wife. How could he accept it?

Moreover, Luo Tian knew Zhang Daotian had once sneaked a peek at Yao Biyue bathing and was caught red-handed. Si Tuchen had punished him severely, but it was just a show for others; in Si Tuchen's heart, Yao Biyue was Zhang Daotian's wife. After all, a husband looking at his wife was natural.

Initially, Luo Tian merely advised Si Tuchen, but no matter how he cajoled him, Si Tuchen shook his head resolutely, as if fixated on Yao Biyue.

Later, the master and disciple had a heated argument—though it wasn't truly a fight; Si Tuchen was simply fed up with Luo Tian's persuasion and roared repeatedly.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian, enraged by Si Tuchen, was sent back to his quarters. His face bore helplessness as he recalled Si Tuchen's furious words, groaning loudly—Zhang Daotian had truly placed this massive dilemma on him.

For the next few days, Luo Tian remained restless in his cave dwelling, even ignoring Zheng Xin's incessant chatter.

Before long, ten days passed, and it was the day Si Tuchen had said the Questioning Heart Sect would come to discuss breaking off the engagement.

Luo Tian rose early, had a meal prepared by servants, and then collapsed onto his bed. He knew if Si Tuchen wanted to find him, it would be effortless—so long as he didn't leave Tian Dao Mountain, everything was manageable.

"Damn it, do whatever you want! I'll just reveal my true identity; see how your grandfather handles it!" Luo Tian cursed, waiting无聊ly for Si Tuchen's displacement.

But as he sat on the bed, Luo Tian felt some trepidation. If he revealed his true identity, would this absurd situation be believable to his grandfather? He was once again agitated.

"Buzz..." A surge of spiritual energy emanated from Luo Tian, and he was displaced to the Dan Sect's reception hall. After all, this was a private matter between Si Tuchen and Luo Tian; it didn't involve the other eight elders. However, two senior masters arrived to show respect for the Questioning Heart Sect.

In the Dan Sect's grand hall, Si Tuchen sat coldly at the head of the table. The other two elders smiled and chatted with the two senior masters from the Questioning Heart Sect.

One of the Questioning Heart Sect's elders maintained a calm expression, with a girl standing behind him whose face seemed cold. The atmosphere in the hall was awkward.

"Senior Si, I suppose there's no need to bring that child here. You know our purpose today. We're friends; I'm here not to harm relations between the two sects," the calm elder finally spoke, unable to bear the awkwardness.

Hearing this, the four elders who had been chatting smiled and fell silent. After all, today Si Tuchen and this elder were the main figures; their words were merely to lighten the mood.

"Senior Jiang Yuansai, you want to break off the engagement? Don't ask me; ask your disciple if he's willing. If he is, no one can stop him. If not, I'll even steal her from the Questioning Heart Sect!" Si Tuchen spoke fiercely.

"You, Senior Si, I'm giving you face to come here personally to apologize; don't be ungrateful. If you insist, I'll see who can take my disciple from the Questioning Heart Sect!" Jiang Yuansai, of such high status, frowned upon hearing Si Tuchen's domineering words.

"Stop arguing, you two! We've known each other for years; don't let this matter harm our friendship!"

"Indeed, I think we should wait for Daotian to arrive. He's changed a lot these days; maybe the two of them will hit it off!" The two elders from Tian Dao Sect, seeing the argument escalate, stepped in to mediate.

"Hmph..." Hearing the two elders' words, the third elder from the Questioning Heart Sect sneered.

"His changes have been quite significant!"

Jiang Yuansai inwardly laughed, believing Zhang Daotian's prodigal reputation was deeply rooted in people's minds. Originally, he had been reluctant about this marriage for the past few years but hesitated due to etiquette. However, a few days ago, his disciple suddenly demanded to break off the engagement and begged him to do so.

Jiang Yuansai, like Si Tuchen, doted on his disciple excessively. Moreover, he felt it was a disgrace for his disciple to marry Zhang Daotian and thus agreed. He had already sent a message to Si Tuchen and personally visited to discuss it.

"Hmph, Senior Si, I'd like to see your disciple's changes these two days!" Jiang Yuansai spoke coldly, emphasizing the words "these two days."

Hearing Jiang Yuansai's words, the two elders from Tian Dao Sect wore a苦笑. They knew their remarks had misunderstood Jiang Yuansai, but they were speaking the truth—they had only noticed Zhang Daotian's changes these past days.

Behind Jiang Yuansai, the girl with a cold gaze had remained silent, her eyes resolute.

"Buzz..." As the atmosphere became unbearably tense, Luo Tian's figure was displaced into the hall by Si Tuchen.

Chapter 613: Not Breaking Off!

"Ugh..." Luo Tian cried out, falling to the ground awkwardly. His backside met the floor; after all, he was displaced while lying down and with his cultivation sealed. He immediately ended up in this situation.

"Master, could you be a bit more careful? I have no cultivation at all! I..." Luo Tian quickly got up, brushing dirt off himself while muttering. Upon seeing not only Si Tuchen but also others, he wisely fell silent.

"Hmph..." Seeing Luo Tian's carefree demeanor, Jiang Yuansai sneered and cast a mocking glance at Si Tuchen.

"Come here!" Si Tuchen, feeling embarrassed, displayed authority and barked at Luo Tian.

"Oh..." Luo Tian dared not be reckless now; after all, it wasn't in Si Tuchen's cave. He had to respect his master's face in front of others.

"Alright, now everyone is here; you two discuss it and see how to handle this!" One of the elders from Tian Dao Sect shook his head. If he hadn't seen Zhang Daotian's performance against the Dark God Temple, he would have thought Zhang Daotian was still a prodigal son.

"Daotian, they've come to break off the engagement. Do you agree? Don't worry; I'll protect you. If you don't agree, no one can take your wife!" Si Tuchen's face carried a threatening expression as he patted Luo Tian's shoulder, sending a hidden force into his body.

"Uh... I..." Luo Tian, seeing Si Tuchen's gaze, hesitated and glanced at Yao Biyue before his body trembled. He was about to speak but found himself unable to.

"Speak up, you fool! Don't be shy!" Si Tuchen smiled and addressed Luo Tian.

"Alas, my disciple is good in every way except being too shy. If he doesn't speak, it means he agrees. Alright, that's settled!" Si Tuchen addressed the three elders from the Questioning Heart Sect.

Luo Tian's lips twitched as he watched his master swiftly settle the marriage, his heart aching but eyes filled with joy, staring at Yao Biyue standing behind the Questioning Heart Sect's elder.

"Respected elder, I'm sorry, but I can't accept this marriage. I've already found someone I love; I apologize!" Feeling Luo Tian's intense gaze, Yao Biyue sneered and spoke before the three elders could. Her eyes were resolute as she addressed Si Tuchen.

"Boom..." As Yao Biyue's words finished, the table made of starsteel beside Si Tuchen shattered into dust, scattering across the hall. A powerful killing intent filled the room.

"What did you say?" Si Tuchen's eyes flashed with coldness, his words spoken one by one.

Feeling Si Tuchen's overwhelming killing intent, Yao Biyue's face turned pale, her body swaying slightly but her eyes resolute.

"Senior Si..." Jiang Yuansai, upon hearing Yao Biyue's words, frowned and sighed inwardly.

This group valued face above all; Yao Biyue's words were a massive insult to Si Tuchen, slapping him in the face.

"Leave... if this matter isn't clarified today, I won't hold back and will unleash a massacre!" Si Tuchen's voice was like ice, slapping Jiang Yuansai across the face.

Jiang Yuansai's body flew backward like a kite, colliding with the hall's door. The entire hall shattered under this impact, revealing the figures of several people to onlookers.

"What's going on?" The disciples of the Dan Sect looked at the figures revealed in their sight.

"Get out of here, all of you..." Si Tuchen's fury reached its peak, his roar echoing in the ears of every disciple of the Dan Sect. The entire mountain trembled under Si Tuchen's overwhelming aura.

"Has领悟ed a fragment of Primordial Chaos Power!" The other two elders from the Questioning Heart Sect looked at Si Tuchen in shock, their expressions bitter.

Si Tuchen's eyes burned with anger as he glared at the four from the Questioning Heart Sect, speaking coldly: "Good, Jiang Yuansai. You've come to insult us! Do you think we're soft targets?"

Jiang Yuansai's face bore bitterness. He hadn't expected his disciple to say such things, nor had he anticipated Si Tuchen possessing a fragment of Primordial Chaos Power.

"Senior Si, please let me explain; it's not what you think! This..." Jiang Yuansai didn't feel embarrassed for being knocked back but immediately stood up and hurriedly addressed Si Tuchen.

"I don't need your explanation! I'll see who dares to steal my disciple's wife!" Si Tuchen sneered, his hand emitting a suction force.

In an instant, Yao Biyue's body was lifted into his hand, and Si Tuchen's large hand clamped around her neck, his face cold.

Though she was immobilized, Yao Biyue's expression remained defiant, her eyes locking onto Si Tuchen's.

"Mind-Scour!" Si Tuchen spoke coldly, and his other hand pressed onto Yao Biyue's head.

"Senior Si, don't!" Jiang Yuansai's face turned pale upon seeing Si Tuchen about to perform a mind-scan.

Mind-scanning was rarely used, as any mishap could cause irreversible harm to the target. If resistance occurred, it would definitely result in a catastrophe, even turning the victim into a fool.

"Senior Si, stay calm!" The elders from Tian Dao Sect also looked anxious, gazing at Si Tuchen.

"Ugh... ugh..." Luo Tian's forehead broke out in sweat, his eyes filled with anxiety. He rushed to Si Tuchen's side, repeatedly headbutting him.

Feeling Luo Tian's urgency, others could ignore it, but Si Tuchen would heed Zhang Daotian. Seeing his disciple's anxious face, Si Tuchen paused and looked at Luo Tian with confusion.

Si Tuchen flicked his finger, sending a spiritual force into Luo Tian's body to disperse the spiritual energy凝聚 in his throat.

"What's wrong?" Si Tuchen spoke softly, his hand ready to act if Luo Tian said no.

"I agree to this marriage, but please release Biyue first. I'll talk to her!" Luo Tian took a deep breath, cleared his throat, and smiled at Yao Biyue.

"Ah... good! Let the young people talk it out. Don't worry, I'll protect you!" Si Tuchen's face showed a hint of satisfaction; he hadn't expected his disciple to change his mind.

"Ugh..." Si Tuchen released Yao Biyue but sealed her cultivation. If she resisted fiercely, he wouldn't mind giving his disciple a "cooked rice" situation.

Chapter 614: Are You Okay?

Luo Tian stepped forward toward Yao Biyue, his face softening. He glanced at the bronze token on her slender waist and sighed: "I never expected we'd meet this way. Have you been well these past years?"

Luo Tian suddenly pulled Yao Biyue into his arms, causing the elders around them to be stunned. Yao Biyue was initially stunned by Luo Tian's action, then her eyes flashed with cold killing intent as she struggled fiercely.

Yao Biyue was merely a woman, and with her cultivation sealed, she was no better than an ordinary person. She couldn't match Luo Tian's strength.

After struggling for a while, she panted heavily, her face grim. However, Luo Tian's next words made her eyes gleam with joy, and she went limp.

"It's me!" Luo Tian gently held Yao Biyue, his face filled with endless tenderness. Though their bodies weren't their original ones, Luo Tian could still sense her aura.

Gu Qianxue had recognized Yao Biyue the moment he saw her, but before he could speak, Si Tuchen had silenced him. That was why the subsequent misunderstanding occurred.

Luo Tian saw Gu Qianxue's defiant gaze when she was captured by Si Tuchen, feeling warmth. When he saw Si Tuchen about to perform a mind-scan, Luo Tian finally panicked and didn't care about respect or not, headbutting Si Tuchen.

Gu Qianxue hadn't expected the man dubbed as a prodigal son on this continent to be Luo Tian.

Gu Qianxue had just awakened, and while she was happy about this identity, she also learned of her marriage contract with Tian Dao Sect disciples.

In Yao Biyue's memories, she had never agreed to this marriage contract; Gu Qianxue was even more resolute in refusing it. After pleading, Jiang Yuansai agreed to dissolve the contract.

"What's going on?" The two elders around them, including the three from the Questioning Heart Sect, looked in disbelief. They couldn't fathom why Yao Biyue, who was always self-respecting, would be embracing a prodigal son.

"Cough... cough..." Si Tuchen's face showed great joy, gazing at Luo Tian. He secretly marveled at his disciple for making this move. He had successfully lured the girl into his arms.

"Hmph, a few days ago you were pretending to be pure and refused outright! Now look at me, how will I deal with you!" Si Tuchen inwardly sneered.

As Si Tuchen's cough echoed, Gu Qianxue was startled, her face flushed red. Luo Tian was stunned; if there were no witnesses, he would have bitten her.

Struggling out of Luo Tian's arms, she stepped back with a hint of reluctance and stood behind Jiang Yuansai, lowering her head without speaking.

"Uh... heh..." Luo Tian also felt his face heat up, chuckling awkwardly before stepping behind Si Tuchen.

"I suppose you've seen it. The two of them are willing; this is settled, right? Senior Jiang, what do you think?" Si Tuchen smiled at Jiang Yuansai. He had completely forgotten the earlier slap that sent him flying.

"Hmph..." Jiang Yuansai sneered, recalling Si Tuchen's violent behavior earlier and spoke softly: "Si Tuchen, you've gone too far today. How can I let Biyue marry your prodigal disciple?"

"Also, your disciple is currently in a mortal state. What qualification does he have to marry my disciple?" Jiang Yuansai's face bore a cold smile as he addressed Si Tuchen, his gaze filled with mockery.

Though Jiang Yuansai didn't know why his disciple had changed so much, he was angry about the earlier slap.

"You are a master who has领悟ed a fragment of Primordial Chaos Power, but you still can't control yourself!" Jiang Yuansai inwardly cried out. He actually agreed, but his pride wouldn't allow it.

"Uh..." Seeing Jiang Yuansai's demeanor, Si Tuchen understood the situation was different now. He realized he had overstepped and smiled at Jiang Yuansai.

"Senior Jiang... we've known each other for years; don't take it so seriously!"

"No..."

"I'll give you an eighth-grade elixir..."

"Rubbish! Your disciple marrying my disciple, how can there be no dowry!" The two exchanged words, leaving Luo Tian and others in awe.

"No, unless your disciple can prove he has the strength to protect Biyue, I won't let her marry him!" Jiang Yuansai spoke firmly.

"Master, I've already agreed!" Gu Qianxue blushed and spoke softly; if it weren't for the keen ears of those present, her voice would have been inaudible.

"Biyue, I'm not confident!" Jiang Yuansai's face showed anxiety, gazing at Luo Tian who looked no different from an ordinary person. He truly wasn't confident.

"Respected elder, just tell me how to make her marry me and prove it!" Luo Tian saw the situation was stalling, especially noticing Si Tuchen's gradually cold expression. He quickly spoke before his master exploded.

"Hmph, simple! Defeat my sect's prodigy, and I'll give you Biyue. Otherwise, don't even dream of it!" Jiang Yuansai's face bore mockery as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Old fool, you really are ungrateful! Believe me, I'll keep all of you here tonight and let the two of them consummate their marriage!" Si Tuchen's gaze turned cold again.

Perhaps Zhang Daotian didn't know who the Questioning Heart Sect's prodigy was. Even if he did, with his current state, who could he fight? A body-tempering realm disciple could crush him.

"Good!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, immediately agreeing with a determined look, gazing at Gu Qianxue's anxious face.

"Stupid disciple! Do you know who the Questioning Heart Sect's prodigies are? You agreed so quickly!" Si Tuchen shook his head.

"I don't care who it is; I'll crush them all!" Luo Tian's face bore battle intent, not fearing anything. After all, with Si Tuchen as a powerful ally, even if he couldn't win, he could have Si Tuchen snatch Gu Qianxue back.

But Luo Tian didn't want to do that. When Gu Qianxue was taken, he felt powerless. Now with his strength restored, he would definitely reclaim her openly.

"Good boy! You're truly my disciple Si Tuchen! Since you want to fight for that girl, I can't help but assist!" Si Tuchen laughed heartily, his eyes filled with pride.

"Go home and rest. Come to me tomorrow; I'll think of ways to help you!" Si Tuchen instructed, then let Luo Tian leave.

Hearing that Si Tuchen would help him, Luo Tian was naturally overjoyed. With Si Tuchen's cultivation and the Dan Sect's resources, enhancing his strength was effortless.

But what annoyed Luo Tian was that in this strange environment, he couldn't take elixirs or use many methods.

Under the respectful gazes of the Dan Sect disciples, Luo Tian returned to his luxurious residence in deep thought.

As soon as he entered the room, he saw Zheng Xin already impatiently waiting, having gathered a group of servants to chat with them.

Since Zheng Xin had awakened, he had been living with Luo Tian under the pretense of protecting him. However, he had occupied half of Luo Tian's cave.

"Luotian, you're back! Where did you go? I was so bored!" Zheng Xin, upon seeing Luo Tian return, flitted to his side like a fly and started chattering.

"You've got problems this time!" Luo Tian kicked Zheng Xin, but was pushed back, his face showing helplessness.

"Go find out who the Questioning Heart Sect's prodigies are, especially the famous ones. I'm going to stir up trouble a month later!" Luo Tian smiled.

"Got it!" Zheng Xin didn't hesitate; he had been bored for a long time and vanished from Luo Tian's room.

"Zheng Xin's investigation isn't enough; I'll also need to rely on those prodigal brothers!" Luo Tian whispered, sending a transmission to his identity token.

"Stirring up trouble?"

"Haha, I knew Daotian couldn't stay still. He's going to marry that girl after all!" The prodigals received Luo Tian's transmission and laughed heartily.

"Questioning Heart Sect... who will I meet? Master Zhang Daotian's memory only recalls one prodigy, but I've forgotten the name," Luo Tian muttered, his gaze deep.

The next morning, after having dinner, the sons of the eight elders and Zheng Xin arrived at Luo Tian's cave.

"Daotian, this time you're really going to hit a wall!" Ren Hongzhi spoke, his face showing no worry but rather mockery.

"Huh?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, waiting for Ren Hongzhi's next words.

"It's like this..." Ren Hongzhi explained the information he had gathered about the Questioning Heart Sect's younger generation. Others did the same, but their accounts were largely similar.

Upon hearing this, Luo Tian understood and wore a surprised expression. He hadn't expected the Questioning Heart Sect, ranked lower among the twelve sects, to have such formidable young talents.

According to Ren Hongzhi's group, the Questioning Heart Sect had no fewer than three prodigies equal to Ma Xiujie and two more who were even stronger. These two rarely appeared in the Questioning Heart Sect or fought, so few knew about them. Only that the sect had three strong individuals, but no one knew of these two prodigies.

"Xi Tong, Meng Cheng!" Luo Tian whispered the names of the two individuals, then smiled: "It's really challenging!"

"Buzz..." A displacement force rose beneath Luo Tian, and his figure appeared in Si Tuchen's cave.

"Did you gather the information?" Si Tuchen smiled.

Luo Tian nodded silently, his gaze filled with anticipation as he looked at Si Tuchen, eager to know what cultivation boon he would receive.

"Scared?" Si Tuchen continued.

"Not at all!" Luo Tian's gaze was resolute as he looked at Si Tuchen.

"Even if I lose, there's still you, right? I'll just have you snatch her back!" Luo Tian spoke. This sentence made Si Tuchen look at him with admiration, but also a hint of anger.

"Hmph!" Si Tuchen sneered and sent seven gray spiritual forces from his hands, forming seven long dragons that entered Luo Tian's body. Luo Tian's face showed shock.

The gray gas had just entered his body when he felt his seven souls, burned earlier, repairing rapidly.

"What is this!" Luo Tian exclaimed, asking Si Tuchen.

"This is Primordial Chaos Power! What people call Primordial Chaos Energy!" Si Tuchen's face showed pride as he spoke softly.

Luo Tian nodded inwardly; a master who had领悟ed a fragment of Primordial Chaos Power was undoubtedly among the top in the Xian Gu Continent. Si Tuchen had every right to be proud.

"Yes, it's Primordial Chaos Power. I thought about it all night; this is the only way to help you quickly. These seven fragments of Primordial Chaos Power are my领悟, and they'll remain in your body forever. From now on, whenever you use that secret technique, it will recover within a minute!" Si Tuchen smiled gently, his face pale.

Upon hearing Si Tuchen's words, Luo Tian felt touched and fell to the ground in a bow: "Please, Master, retrieve the Primordial Chaos Power!"

Luo Tian knew this was a performance; it might be an opportunity, but for him, it didn't matter. He willingly immersed himself in the performance to fulfill Master Zhang Daotian's regret and his Grandmaster Si Tuchen's wish.

"It's no problem!" Si Tuchen gently helped Luo Tian up, his face showing satisfaction.

"I can't protect you forever, so become strong! Don't let me down!" He gently patted Luo Tian's head, his expression filled with endless tenderness.

"Also, I've already discussed with the other eight elders to open a轮回 Bridge for you!" Si Tuchen spoke softly.

Chapter 615: The轮回 Bridge Opens!

"Recall the轮回 Bridge?" Luo Tian's eyes showed contemplation, recalling Zhang Daotian's description of the轮回 Bridge. His mind thundered, his face filled with disbelief.

The轮回 Bridge was a special location of the Tian Dao Sect. Legends said it was a fragment of the轮回 Road, possessing轮回 Power.

However, high-ranking disciples of the Tian Dao Sect knew it was a divine artifact of the sect, as precious as the Heaven-Defying Thunder Sword. While the Heaven-Defying Thunder Sword was for combat, the轮回 Bridge assisted cultivation.

The轮回 Bridge opened once every ten thousand years. Now that Si Tuchen had again humbled himself to beg the other eight elders, it was clear he had incurred a significant debt.

"Don't act like a girl; go! Prepare, and tomorrow when the bell rings, gather at the square. I won't be there!" Si Tuchen waved his hand, and Luo Tian appeared outside the cave.

Luo Tian stood at the cave entrance, his eyes moist as he gazed deeply at the cave before heading to his residence.

With Si Tuchen's Primordial Chaos Power repairing him, Luo Tian's seven souls reformed. His strength returned to the peak of Yuan Ling, a half-step into the Soul-Formation realm.

The next morning, a heavy bell rang across Tian Dao Sect's square. Just one sound sent all disciples rushing to the square.

Luo Tian, Zheng Xin, and the sons of the eight elders moved among the crowd, finally standing at the front.

The Tian Dao Sect's Grandmaster appeared in the sky with a stern expression, his loud voice echoing: "To promote your cultivation, the nine elders have decided to open the轮回 Bridge once every ten thousand years. Today we open it for all disciples to enhance Tian Dao Sect's overall strength!"

"Wow..." As the Grandmaster's words ended, the disciples' faces showed excitement. The轮回 Bridge was a trial ground for Tian Dao Sect disciples; every disciple dreamed of entering it, as each entry would greatly enhance their strength.

"Long live the elders!" The disciples erupted in enthusiastic cheers.
