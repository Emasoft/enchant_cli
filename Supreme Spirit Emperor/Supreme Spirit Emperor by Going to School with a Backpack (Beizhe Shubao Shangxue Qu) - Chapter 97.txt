A dozen individuals radiating immense fluctuations stood within a grand hall, a heavy atmosphere forming within the chamber.

"Zheng Hongsheng, after our Yuyan arrived at your Jifeng Valley, why has the soul lamp become so dim? Hand over Yuyan immediately, or I shall not let this end here!" an elder with white hair barked, his face contorted with anger as he addressed Zheng Hongsheng.

Zheng Hongsheng, upon hearing the elder's words, spoke softly: "Elder Yang, do not be hasty. I have received word from the Yuliling Sect that Yuyan and Zheng Xin, along with the sect's young master, have left Kunlun Mountain. I have already dispatched that little scoundrel with several others to return!"

"Indeed... Elder Yang, rest assured. Our sect's ancestral sage has personally gone to Beichang County and confirmed... er, Yuyan is unharmed!" Leng Hongcai spoke, his face displaying a faint warmth.

Yet within Leng Hongcai's heart, he trembled, concealing the truth that Yuyan had become a spiritual soul. He knew if these elders learned of it, Jifeng Valley would erupt in chaos, and even Yuliling Sect would suffer repercussions.

"Indeed, Elder Yang, do not worry. Let the child gain experience outside—this is beneficial!" Duan Chenfeng scoffed, offering his counsel.

"Hmph. Who does not know your three sects are in cahoots? Do not spout empty words to us. If Yuyan is found today, all will be well. But if you do not hand her over, then do not blame Danzong for turning against Jifeng Valley!" Several Danzong elders spoke in turn, their faces etched with impatience.

"Are you seeking trouble? Do you think we are so easily intimidated?" Before Zheng Hongsheng could respond, a mocking laugh echoed from behind him.

"Shan Xinshui! What are you? I was speaking to your sect's master. What right do you have to interfere?" Elder Yang, upon spotting the source of the voice, flashed another wave of anger.

"Yang Kaiji, you are Danzong's Grand Elder. I am Jifeng Valley's Grand Elder. My strength is slightly superior to yours—do I not have the right to speak with you?" Shan Xinshui, addressed by name, rebuked.

"Enough!" Zheng Hongsheng finally could not contain his fury, roaring aloud. A surge of Soul Formation Peak pressure instantly enveloped the entire hall, his voice thundering like rolling clouds.

"Crack..." The hall's doors creaked open as Zheng Tianxiao and Zheng Bowen strode in, their faces grim upon seeing Zheng Hongsheng's expression.

"Father... your brother has returned!" The two brothers spoke in unison, momentarily lightening the hall's oppressive atmosphere.

"Little bastard! I'll teach you a lesson for bringing Yuyan here!" Zheng Hongsheng's heart leapt with joy, issuing orders.

Zheng Tianxiao and Zheng Bowen nodded in agreement before bowing and retreating.

...

After days of relentless travel, Luo Tian and his companions finally returned to Jifeng Valley.

The four strode through the valley, their bodies radiating formidable fluctuations, as Jifeng Valley disciples gazed in astonishment.

"Luo Tian, I must tell you—my popularity here is truly remarkable. Who doesn't know me Zheng Xin..." Zheng Xin began, but upon seeing the disciples' expressions—avoiding him like a sacred relic—he understood his image in Jifeng Valley.

"Yuyan!" A voice echoed through the crowd, reaching their ears. Several young men in blue robes, faces brimming with arrogance, approached Zheng Xin.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow, spotting the large "Danzong" symbol on their sleeves. His mind puzzled: "Danzong?"

"Yang Hongguang! What are you doing here?" Before Zheng Xin could speak, Shan Yuyan's brow furrowed slightly as she inquired.

"Of course I'm waiting for you. Who else would I wait for?" The youth's face bore an air of superiority, ignoring Zheng Xin entirely as his gaze locked onto Shan Yuyan with fervor.

"Yang Hongguang?" Zheng Xin stepped forward, seizing Shan Yuyan's hand with a cold stare.

Luo Tian observed their expressions, deducing their relationship and sighing inwardly: "A woman's downfall!"

"Boom..."

"Zheng Xin, you truly have no shame!" Upon witnessing Zheng Xin's actions, those accompanying Yang Hongguang erupted into outrage.

"Let go of your hand—your unworthy!" Yang Hongguang's face twisted with fury, shouting.

Shan Yuyan was momentarily stunned by Zheng Xin's move but soon blushed, giving a token struggle before allowing him to hold her.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan were equally taken aback, sensing Zheng Xin had transformed into a different person—no longer the verbose Zheng Xin.

"Yuyan!" Upon seeing Shan Yuyan's expression, which had once made her furious at Zheng Xin, Yang Hongguang's face bore bewilderment. He could not fathom why she had changed.

"Boom..." A surge of Soul Formation Initial stage energy erupted from Yang Hongguang, pressing heavily against Zheng Xin.

"Yang Hongguang, do not overstep!" Shan Yuyan sneered, pointing a finger. A surge of three thousand scorching flames erupted from her palm, dissipating Yang Hongguang's pressure.

"Three thousand scorching flames! Yuyan, you've fully mastered them!" Yang Hongguang and his disciples gaped in disbelief, staring at the purple flames in her hand.

Yang Hongguang's face soon lit with joy. He had long coveted Shan Yuyan, and the primary reason was her identity as the sect's daughter and the three thousand scorching flames within her.

"Zheng Xin, you just hide behind a woman? Have the courage to stand up! To others, you're a prodigy, but in my eyes, what are you? What right do you have to claim Yuyan? A coward hiding behind a woman!" Yang Hongguang's voice dripped with mockery, piercing Zheng Xin's heart.

"Silence!" A cold voice echoed as Luo Tian materialized before Yang Hongguang, his hand shooting out to strike Yang Hongguang's face.

Chapter 475: I'll Take His Place

"Spit...!" Yang Hongguang's face bore disbelief as he spat blood, flying backward.

"Gasps..." A ripple of astonishment swept through the crowd as they gazed at Luo Tian, bewildered by this formidable figure. Their minds raced with questions about his identity.

More astonishing was Luo Tian's power—Yang Hongguang, a Soul Formation Initial stage master, had been felled by a single slap. How formidable was this youth?

The young men accompanying Yang Hongguang halted their mockery, their faces etched with disbelief. Among them, the strongest was Yang Hongguang himself, yet he had been felled by this youth. Reclaiming their dignity through brute force was now impossible.

"You dare speak to my brother like that!" Luo Tian's face bore coldness as he gazed at Yang Hongguang, now on the ground.

"Who are you?" As the crowd assisted him, Yang Hongguang slowly rose, his gaze cold and piercing toward Luo Tian.

"Yuliling Sect's Luo Tian, Zheng Xin's brother!" Luo Tian spoke calmly, not even glancing at Yang Hongguang.

"Luo Tian!"

"He's the rising young sect master of Yuliling Sect?"

"I wondered why he looked so familiar!" The Jifeng Valley disciples murmured among themselves.

Zheng Xin's face bore gratitude; Luo Tian had not hesitated to defend him despite his unknown identity, warming Zheng Xin's heart. Yet he felt guilt—his own inadequacy forced his brother to fight for him, and his helplessness in the face of mockery toward his woman.

Luo Tian patted Zheng Xin's shoulder, conveying "all is well," then turned to mock Yang Hongguang: "Do not belittle others with your alchemist status. Here, your alchemist title is worthless!"

"Boom..." Luo Tian's words echoed in the crowd but detonated like a bomb.

Since alchemists emerged, their status had been exalted on the Tianyuan Continent. A fourth-tier alchemist was a coveted prize for top sects. Yet Luo Tian's words had rendered Yang Hongguang's alchemist status meaningless.

"You dare insult alchemists? Do you not fear Danzong will turn against Yuliling Sect?" Yang Hongguang's face bore mockery; this was his first encounter with someone who despised alchemists.

"Ha! Can you represent Danzong? When did Danzong become your surname?" Shan Yuyan's voice cut through, striking Yang Hongguang like a slap.

"Ha!" The crowd laughed heartily, their faces sneering at Yang Hongguang.

"Being undermined by your own people—this kid's popularity in Danzong isn't great, is it?"

"Exactly. Thinking himself the grandson of a Grand Elder, he believes he represents Danzong. How shameless!" The Jifeng Valley disciples mocked.

Clearly, Yang Hongguang's attitude had angered the Jifeng Valley disciples. Zheng Xin, though verbose, was the third son of the valley's leader. Yang Hongguang had clearly aimed to humiliate Zheng Xin, and by extension, Jifeng Valley. Such an affront could not be tolerated.

"Good! Luo Tian, Zheng Xin—remember this grudge!" Yang Hongguang's face twisted with hatred as he spoke.

"Ha! Do you think your alchemy skills make you superior? Alchemists are nothing but commoners. If I focused on alchemy, I'd have reached the peak of the art long ago. Do not flaunt your alchemist status before me!" Luo Tian's cold words aimed to shatter Yang Hongguang's resolve.

"Hmm..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the Jifeng Valley disciples' gazes shifted slightly.

"This is too bold!" The crowd's faces bore disbelief; never before had they heard such arrogance.

To become an alchemist was a revered honor, with stringent requirements. Yet Luo Tian's words had enraged Yang Hongguang and his companions more than a slap, as they felt their dignity wounded.

"Seems you know alchemy—dare to challenge me?" Yang Hongguang forced his anger down.

"Ha! Zheng Xin, your brother's courage is lacking!" Yang Hongguang sneered at Zheng Xin.

"Don't bother Zheng Xin—his matter is mine to handle! Today, I'll humiliate your face completely!" Luo Tian sneered, accepting the challenge.

"Gasps..."

"He truly dares! He doesn't know Yang Hongguang's alchemy skills are renowned!" The Jifeng Valley disciples gasped, their faces awestruck as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Seeing Luo Tian accept the challenge, Shan Yuyan and Zheng Xin exchanged glances, their brows furrowed. Though they knew Luo Tian's alchemy skills were exceptional, in their minds, his art paled compared to a true Danzong disciple.

Danzong held great prestige on the Tianyuan Continent, and its alchemy was world-renowned. Luo Tian's challenge to a Danzong disciple seemed self-defeating.

"If I win, you let Zheng Xin break the engagement with Yuyan! How about that?" Yang Hongguang's face bore a sly grin.

"Go to hell..."

"You dare? If not, move aside! Don't talk nonsense or I'll slap you again!" Luo Tian sneered, his disdain for such overbearing individuals reaching its peak. If not for his Yuliling Sect's young master status, he would have already beaten Yang Hongguang senseless.

"Uh..." Yang Hongguang was momentarily stunned, speechless.

"A cheerful voice echoed from the crowd: "Brother Zheng! Long time no see!" Two figures strode forward under the Jifeng Valley disciples' reverent gazes.

"Brother..." Zheng Xin's face lit up, calling out.

Luo Tian turned to see Zheng Tianxiao and Zheng Bowen approaching with anxious expressions.

"Luo Tian..." Zheng Bowen's face bore excitement; he had thought Luo Tian was possessed but now saw him alive.

Two more chapters today! You shouldn't hold back—read daily, or PK will fall, and no爆发!"

Chapter 476: One Step to Crush

"Brother Zheng, long time no see!" Luo Tian smiled, bowing to Zheng Bowen.

"You are Luo Tian?" Zheng Tianxiao approached with a warm smile.

"Guess this is Brother Zheng Tianxiao?" Luo Tian smiled back, but inwardly marveled. When he and the others had fled Jifeng Valley before, he'd observed Zheng Tianxiao secretly. At that time, Zheng Tianxiao was Soul Formation Initial stage.

But now, observing his aura, it had advanced to Soul Formation Mid-stage—this astonished Luo Tian.

Even more astonishing was Zheng Bowen's cultivation had also reached Soul Formation, leaving Luo Tian in awe of Jifeng Valley's depth.

"Thank you for saving my two brothers multiple times!" Zheng Tianxiao's face bore gratitude as he bowed to Luo Tian.

"Enough talk later—Father and others are waiting in the hall. If we wait longer, he'll get impatient!" Zheng Bowen suddenly reminded them.

Upon hearing Zheng Bowen's reminder, Zheng Tianxiao smacked his head, grabbing Zheng Xin: "Little bastard! If you didn't return, I'd have thought you ran off with her. Come on, let's go to the hall and see how Father deals with you!"

"Brother, you are my real brother. Please speak for me!" Zheng Xin's face bore a pitiful expression, prompting the Jifeng Valley disciples to laugh.

With that, Zheng Tianxiao led Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan into the hall, while Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan, of equal status, followed.

"Hmph... afraid you're trying to escape?" Yang Hongguang's sneer echoed behind them.

Zheng Tianxiao turned, gazing at Yang Hongguang. As Zheng Tianxiao was older, he didn't recognize Yang Hongguang but knew Danzong had sent several young disciples.

"Who is he?" Zheng Tianxiao's face bore confusion as he asked Zheng Bowen.

"Danzong's Yang Hongguang, the grandson of Danzong's Grand Elder!" Zheng Bowen replied with a faint smile.

Upon hearing the Zheng brothers' gaze, Yang Hongguang straightened his chest: "Hmph! I didn't expect Yuliling Sect and Jifeng Valley people to be cowards! None dare accept the challenge!"

"Die!" The Jifeng Valley disciples' faces bore pity, gazing at Yang Hongguang with a look of seeing a fool.

Zheng Tianxiao inherited Zheng Hongsheng's dominance, never allowing anyone to defy him. Now Yang Hongguang had dared insult Jifeng Valley and Zheng Xin, so Zheng Tianxiao would not tolerate it.

Indeed, as Yang Hongguang's words ended, a gust of wind struck his face, sending him flying again—more pitiful than Luo Tian's slap. Three teeth flew from his mouth.

"Get lost, I don't have time for you!" Zheng Tianxiao's face bore disgust as he waved, leading Zheng Xin and others into the hall.

"Cough...!" Yang Hongguang, assisted by Danzong disciples, rose, his face twisted with hatred.

At this moment, Yang Hongguang felt as if he'd eaten dirt—this was his first time ever insulted.

In Danzong, as the grandson of a Grand Elder, Yang Hongguang had always been superior. His alchemy skills were top-tier, and he was always flattered.

Now in Jifeng Valley, first Luo Tian slapped him, then Zheng Tianxiao—should Tianjiantong also slap him, he'd have been slapped by all three sects.

As Yang Hongguang mused, the crowd stirred. Several disciples with long swords emerged from the throng.

"Duan... Duan Xingchen!" Yang Hongguang suddenly realized his thoughts, seeing the leader was Duan Xingchen. He instinctively covered his face with both hands, trembling as he spoke:

"Duan Xingchen...!"

Duan Xingchen radiated a cold aura, not even glancing at Yang Hongguang. He carried the Starry Sword and led Tianjiantong disciples out of the crowd.

Yang Hongguang's gaze turned icy, watching Duan Xingchen leave. His disdainful attitude ignited Yang Hongguang's fury: "I will crush you all beneath my feet!"

Yang Hongguang spoke, leading Danzong disciples out of Jifeng Valley's disciples' mocking gazes toward the hall.

...

In the hall, Leng Hongcai and Duan Chenfeng among others smiled as Zheng Xin and others entered.

Leng Hongcai's face bore joy; he had learned from Yuliling Sect's ancestral sage that Luo Tian had advanced to Soul Formation. Now seeing it with his own eyes, he felt even more satisfied.

Duan Chenfeng's gaze at Luo Tian held surprise; when Duan Xingchen had advanced to Soul Formation, he was present and witnessed Luo Tian's attainment of Soul Formation Third Trial. At that time, Duan Chenfeng had been astonished. Now seeing Luo Tian's advancement to Soul Formation, he felt a pang of sorrow for his son.

Without Luo Tian, Duan Chenfeng had confidence that Duan Xingchen would become a formidable figure on the Tianyuan Continent within a century.

But with Luo Tian's presence, Duan Chenfeng knew any genius would pale in comparison to Luo Tian.

"Alas..." Duan Chenfeng's eyes bore bitterness.

"Hmph! Zheng Xin, you little bastard, why did you play hide-and-seek with me? Tell me where you've been these days!" Zheng Hongsheng, seeing his son had advanced to Bone-Consuming Peak, felt a slight joy but scowled.

"Father, I must explain—our escape had reasons! You don't know how dangerous it was!" Zheng Xin began, recounting their experiences. The crowd marveled, especially at Luo Tian's ability to craft a human body. Their gazes toward Luo Tian were filled with awe.

"Danzong Grand Elder, why did my disciples almost perish upon arriving at your Jifeng Valley? Do you intend to give me an explanation?" Danzong's Grand Elder spoke with anger.

"Grand Elder, I have no issue! Moreover, I've fused three thousand scorching flames and advanced to Soul Formation. All this is thanks to Zheng Xin!" Shan Yuyan stood beside Zheng Xin, addressing Yang Kaiji. Yet she was puzzled—why had the Grand Elder, who had always been kind to her, now seemed so different?

Chapter 477: Yang Kaiji

"Yuyan, come here! Are you still a Danzong disciple?" Yang Kaiji's face bore anger as he addressed Shan Yuyan.

"No!" Shan Yuyan's face showed defiance, gazing at Yang Kaiji.

"Crack..." The hall door was pushed open as Duan Xingchen, his face cold, strode in. Upon seeing Leng Qiuchan, his gaze flickered slightly.

Then Duan Xingchen saw Luo Tian beside Leng Qiuchan, his eyes flashing with intense battle intent. He lightly touched his sword before letting his hand fall.

"Duan Chenfeng, is this your son? How impolite!" Yang Kaiji frowned upon seeing Duan Xingchen enter.

"Grandfather... please help me!" Yang Hongguang, eyes teary, walked in with a swollen face. He approached Yang Kaiji.

Seeing Yang Hongguang's pitiful state, everyone's gaze fell on him. In the hall, the weakest were Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin—Bone-Consuming Peak cultivators. They could sense Yang Hongguang was a Soul Formation Initial stage master.

Yet the red handprints on his face were unmistakable, leaving people puzzled: what cultivation could leave such clear marks on a Soul Formation master?

"What happened!" Yang Kaiji, seeing his beloved grandson slapped twice, bore anger and demanded answers.

Feeling his grandfather's fury, Yang Hongguang's eyes flickered slightly as he recounted how Luo Tian had slapped him and how he'd been mocked by both Luo Tian and Zheng Tianxiao. He exaggerated the story, ending as if he were a victim of abuse.

"Rascal!" Yang Kaiji roared, gazing at Leng Hongcai and Zheng Hongsheng.

"Two of you—this matter isn't over!" Yang Kaiji's face bore coldness as he demanded answers.

Yang Kaiji, now blinded by anger, had forgotten who he was speaking to. In Danzong, he always ruled with an iron fist, indulging Yang Hongguang to the point of obsession. His visit to Jifeng Valley was also tied closely to Yang Hongguang.

Yang Kaiji's main purpose in coming to Jifeng Valley was to sabotage Shan Yuyan and Zheng Xin's engagement, giving his grandson an opportunity.

Thus, when he arrived at Jifeng Valley, he criticized this and that, even shouting at Zheng Hongsheng.

Zheng Hongsheng, as a sect leader, had always maintained good relations with other sects. Plus, Yang Kaiji's alchemy skills were renowned in the Eastern Region, so he couldn't offend too deeply.

Everyone has their limits; Zheng Hongsheng was a sect leader and the head of the Eastern Region's largest sect. When Yang Kaiji spoke to him in front of many Jifeng Valley disciples, Zheng Hongsheng could not tolerate it. To let his face be trampled was unthinkable.

"Grand Elder Yang, how do you wish me to provide an explanation?" Zheng Hongsheng's face finally darkened, his tone carrying a chill.

"Apologize! Let your second son and this Luo Tian apologize before the tens of thousands of disciples from the three sects!" Yang Kaiji, now blinded by anger, failed to notice the chill in Zheng Hongsheng's words.

"Old bastard! Do you think you're something? I slapped your grandson today—what's next,不服就来! Believe me, I'll beat both of you!" Zheng Tianxiao saw his father's darkened face and stepped forward, pointing at Yang Kaiji.

"Shameless!"
"Embarrassing Danzong!" Muttered voices spread through the crowd. At this point, it wasn't just the three sects—various renowned sects from the Eastern Region had arrived.

"Leng Hongcai, don't just stand there—how do you handle this?" Yang Kaiji's face reddened upon hearing Zheng Tianxiao. Seeing Zheng Hongsheng's gradually darkening expression, he dared not offend Jifeng Valley fully and shifted his focus to the amiable Leng Hongcai.

"Uh..." Upon being targeted, Leng Hongcai was momentarily stunned before his face darkened.

"Really taking me for a pushover!" Leng Hongcai inwardly sneered, about to speak when a cold voice echoed from behind him.

"Indeed, you are a fine elder of Danzong! Danzong's face is truly disgraced. Do you think I Yuliling Sect is easy to bully?" Luo Tian did not curse but stepped before Leng Hongcai, speaking coldly.

"Boy, what are you? Daring to speak like that to me!" Yang Kaiji was now thoroughly enraged, seeing this youth dare defy him. He roared again.

"Apologize? Impossible! But a second slap is possible!" Luo Tian's words had just ended when he activated the sixth step of Fung Heaven Step. No one reacted in time, and Luo Tian's figure appeared before Yang Hongguang, his foot as if stepping on a rainbow, slamming fiercely into Yang Hongguang's abdomen.

Luo Tian's hand was not idle either, delivering another slap to Yang Hongguang's face with a crisp sound.

Silence—this moment was oddly quiet. No one expected Luo Tian to dare slap Yang Hongguang in front of so many sect masters and elders.

"Little bastard, you're seeking death!" Yang Kaiji's face bore fury as he saw Luo Tian's audacity. His Soul Formation Late stage power erupted, a streak of emerald green fire flying from his hand, forming a rocket aimed at Luo Tian.

"Bijing Lilu Fire!" Leng Hongcai's eyes bore shock, then his figure moved like lightning to block Luo Tian. He struck with a palm, halting the emerald fire.

The fire halted but did not disperse; it wrapped around Leng Hongcai's hand like a snake, burning relentlessly.

Leng Hongcai waved his hand, and the fire extinguished, but his palm was red.

"Yang, truly a fine elder of Danzong! You've disgraced Danzong's honor. Do you think I Yuliling Sect is easy to bully?" Leng Hongcai's eyes flashed like lightning, gazing at Yang Kaiji.

"Is this not the little bastard who struck first? I struck second. Why do you let him get away with it?" Yang Kaiji's face bore no shame, shifting the blame to Luo Tian.

"This is my first time seeing such shameless person! Your grandson is your grandson, but others' disciples are not? That slap was clearly aimed at killing him. Yet you blame me for hitting your grandson, Yang Kaiji! Have you had enough? Do you think the three sects are made of clay!" Duan Chenfeng spoke, his gaze icy toward Yang Kaiji.

Chapter 478: The Match

"Grand Elder Duan, what business do you have with this matter? Are you also meddling in this chaos?" Upon Duan Chenfeng's words, Yang Kaiji's face finally changed.

"I don't wish to meddle in this chaos. I came for the wedding, but seeing your Danzong's arrogance and disrespect toward our three sects, I felt uneasy!" Duan Chenfeng spoke softly, his gaze filled with disdain.

"Yang Kaiji, you've used Bijing Lilu Fire—this I view as an insult to Yuliling Sect. This matter between Danzong and Yuliling Sect is not over!" Leng Hongcai's voice was cold, his eyes filled with frost as he gazed at Yang Kaiji.

Bijing Lilu Fire, one of Danzong's three ancestral fires, was as terrifying as the Three Thousand Scorching Flames. Once fully ignited, it could destroy heaven and earth.

Yang Kaiji had only used a thread of Bijing Lilu Fire, but it was enough to severely injure a Soul Formation Initial stage master. If it had entered Luo Tian's body and Yang Kaiji fully detonated it, Luo Tian's life would have been at risk.

Yang Kaiji now bore a grim expression. Danzong's depth and power were vast, but if the three sects united, Danzong would be instantly annihilated. After all, the three sects were the true masters of Kunlun Mountain.

Yet now, it was a case of no turning back. Seeing his grandson's swollen face, Yang Kaiji's expression twisted with hatred.

"What do you wish to do?" Yang Kaiji coldly asked, scanning Zheng Hongsheng and others.

"What? Let me be clear—behave yourself! Since the sect's master is in seclusion, you should act as a proper elder. Let these two children complete their marriage, then leave with your people!" Zheng Hongsheng spoke, his voice carrying the authority of a sect leader.

"Impossible!"

"It's impossible for Danzong to endure this humiliation and let Yuyan marry in!" Yang Kaiji loudly refused.

"Then what do you wish? Don't be so arrogant! If pushed, I'll keep you here. I want to see if Danzong would dare go to war with us three sects!" Zheng Hongsheng coldly replied.

"Really taking yourself for a green onion! If not for your age and status, I'd have slapped you long ago!" Duan Chenfeng's face bore disdain as he replied loudly.

"I said what? I heard that this boy insulted my Danzong lineage, looked down on our alchemists, and challenged Hongguang!" Yang Kaiji turned his gaze to Luo Tian, asking.

"Fact!" Luo Tian's face was calm, unafraid, speaking coldly. For this pair of grandpa and grandson, Luo Tian had reached his limit. But considering Zheng Xin would still need to marry Danzong, he could not afford to escalate things.

"Then let's settle this with a match!" Yang Kaiji's face bore a sly smile.

Upon hearing Yang Kaiji's words, the crowd furrowed their brows slightly, their gazes filled with curiosity as they awaited his next words.

"If Luo Tian wins, I'll say nothing and the wedding will proceed normally! This matter is settled!" Yang Kaiji's face bore confidence.

"What if Luo Tian loses?" Zheng Xin could not help but ask, as it concerned his fate.

"If he loses, then the engagement is settled! And Luo Tian and Zheng Tianxiao must kneel to apologize to Hongguang! Boy, dare you accept?" Yang Kaiji's face bore a playful expression as he surveyed the crowd.

"This..." The people's gazes turned to Luo Tian, who stood calm and indifferent.

Luo Tian's eyes were cold, his lips slightly upturned. If he accepted now, it would mean severing his relationship with Zheng Xin completely—this matter concerned Zheng Xin's future.

If he refused, it would mean his own disgrace; losing face was fine, but another identity—Yuliling Sect's young master—would also be disgraced.

"Old bastard, since you're seeking trouble, don't blame me!" Luo Tian inwardly sneered.

The people present were all shrewd, naturally sensing Yang Kaiji's sinister intent but unable to argue. They turned their gazes to Luo Tian.

Yang Hongguang, hearing Yang Kaiji's words, felt joy—his alchemy skills were unmatched. A mere Luo Tian was no match. If he won, not only would he break Shan Yuyan and Zheng Xin's engagement but also have Luo Tian and Zheng Tianxiao kneel to apologize. This was a win-win situation.

"Old dog, your plan is good, but if I win, you'll do nothing! If I lose, I'll apologize. You think the world is as foolish as you!" Luo Tian's face bore a smile, gazing at Yang Kaiji.

"Old dog!"

"He actually called Yang Kaiji an old dog!" The crowd's faces bore shock.

But soon, their expressions returned to normal; this fierce man had just slapped Yang Hongguang in front of them.

"Zheng Xin is my brother. If he wishes, no one—neither you nor your ancestral sage—can stop him! What are you?"

"Apologizing is something I've never done. When the old ancestor of Yuyan's sect ordered me to kneel, I refused. Unfortunately, he is now dead!"

"But since you proposed the match, if I don't accept, then I am not Luo Tian!" Luo Tian did not wait for Yang Kaiji to respond but spoke like a barrage of words.

Zheng Xin's face bore excitement—not just for Luo Tian's words, but the speed at which he spoke made him feel a true connection. He gazed at Luo Tian with fiery eyes.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and a heavy sound echoed in the hall—a pressure capable of subduing all things formed instantly, pressing against everyone.

"Boom..." The soul-restraining cauldron stood on the hall's floor, cracks forming at its base with a piercing hum.

"Treasure! Definitely a high-grade treasure!" The crowd's eyes widened, gazing at the soul-restraining cauldron.

"If I lose this cauldron belongs to you! The wedding proceeds as normal!" Luo Tian's face bore a smile, gazing at Yang Kaiji and his disciples with greedy eyes.

Upon seeing the soul-restraining cauldron, Yang Kaiji's eyes did not move, his breathing even becoming hurried.

Alchemists valued cauldrons most; a good alchemy cauldron could drive any alchemist mad.
