“Should we calm these city lords’ anger, it would be much better. Nangong and Dogger, go investigate…” Luotian spoke to Nangong Yuqing and Diaodezhu before transmitting his thoughts to them.

“I’ve said it for thousands of years—I’m not a dog!” Diaodezhu sighed, but followed Nangong Yuqing out of the crowd.

“Must we consume these resentments?” Yeliangchen and Yehong were thrown by the explosion, colliding with the barrier. Yeliangchen’s gaze fell upon the blood-red hand.

“Again!” Yehong sneered. These resentments had been accumulated for years—fully capable of killing a peak immortal, beyond Yeliangchen’s capacity.

Sneering, Yehong pressed his hands into seals, firing more imprints onto the blood-red hand of resentment.

“Wum…!” The thunderous震荡 shook, and the blood-red brush stirred again, carving a blood-red figure that lunged at Yeliangchen.

Yeliangchen’s eyes darkened. He slashed with his star blade, and the stars in the sky moved again. With a thunderous crash, one star plummeted from the heavens, pressing down upon the blood-red figure.

“Peng…” The resentment surged, a tempest of resentment swirling outward, sweeping over Yeliangchen and Yehong.

“Not one, but ten… a hundred?” Yehong showed no surprise. He spat blood, which transformed into crimson seals, embedding themselves into the blood-red hand.

Shadows flickered—numerous blood-red figures were drawn by the hand, each mirroring Yehong’s appearance but with varying cultivation levels.

In an instant, over a hundred blood-red figures descended from the sky, rushing toward Yeliangchen. Simultaneously, the blood-red hand shattered into a crimson mass, vanishing from sight.

“How convenient! I’ve also mastered such a martial art!” Yeliangchen observed the blood-red figures charging him, his expression calm. He gazed at the stars above and swiftly moved his hands.

Yeliangchen opened his mouth, releasing a silver river that soared into the sky like a starry river. It shattered abruptly, scattering into points of light across the heavens.

In an instant, stars fell—numerous meteors descended from the sky, landing before the onlookers. Dust swirled and dispersed, revealing silver figures standing there—identical to Yeliangchen.

“Ten… a hundred…” Over hundreds of figures, far exceeding Yehong’s blood-figures. Their emergence caused Yehong’s expression to darken.

“Kill them!” Yeliangchen pointed, and the hundreds of figures surged toward Yehong.

“Hmph. I never expected this brat to master the Illusion Star Technique so thoroughly!” Ye Wudao and Ye Tian remarked, their faces stunned.

“Truly remarkable martial art. Is Yeliangchen this strong?” Li Tianzhi and others marveled, watching the starry figures. They had no countermeasures.

A hundred against hundreds—within moments, Yehong’s blood-figures were obliterated by Yeliangchen’s illusions. Both Yehong and Yeliangchen bore pale faces, their bodies exhausted from the overwhelming martial arts.

“Kill!” After a battle, Yeliangchen’s illusions numbered over two hundred. He urged them to attack Yehong while he himself charged forward, lifting his star blade.

“Damn it…” Yehong cursed, instantly surrounded by silver figures. His blood-red brush swung wildly, each swing shattering a silver figure into swirling debris.

Yehong was formidable. Despite the onslaught, he deflected Yeliangchen’s attacks and endured for half an hour. Yet exhausted and wounded, he lacked the strength to fight further. Yeliangchen’s blade sliced his chest, nearly cleaving him in two.

“Peng…” Yehong’s body collapsed to the ground, his eyes burning with fierce resentment.

“Have you surrendered?” Yeliangchen loomed over the weakened Yehong, sneering as he stepped on his body.

“Yeliangchen, the Disciple of the Way, has won!” The Star River Mansion’s disciples erupted in awe, their gazes filled with reverence.

Previously, they had respected Yeliangchen for his protectiveness. But today, he proved himself through strength—no longer the spoiled brat but a true heir to Star River Mansion’s Lord Ye Wudao. A tiger father bore no dog son; he deserved the Disciple of the Way position.

“Useless!” Some elders’ faces darkened. Yeliangchen’s outburst had shocked them.

Ye Wudao and Ye Tian quickly approached the elders with odd expressions, their gazes flickering.

“All of you are useless!”

It seemed only the next step remained. The elders exchanged silent thoughts, resuming their composed demeanor.

“I refuse!” Yehong roared, his voice laced with venom. “I am Yehong—after years of patience, I should have soared. How could I lose to this spoiled brat!”

“Indeed, you are a pitiable man…” Yeliangchen furrowed his brows, raising his star blade to stab Yehong.

“Stop!” Seeing Yeliangchen about to kill Yehong, Ye Xiao and two other elders shouted.

“Wum…” Yet Yeliangchen ignored them. After so long searching for Yehong, he would not let him escape.

“Pu…” The blue blade pierced Yehong’s heart, ending his life. Yet Yehong’s face bore resentment, his eyes wide open.

“Yeliangchen, you are a criminal. You murdered your kin. Lord Ye of the clan suggests we strike down this rebellious son!” Ye Xiao bellowed, watching Yehong’s death without concern. He seized the moment.

As he spoke, Ye Xiao flew toward Yeliangchen, his blue hand swinging fiercely.

“Wum…” A black sword slashed through, shattering the blue hand. Luotian sat in his cart beside Yeliangchen, smirking at Ye Xiao.

“Who are you to judge him?” Luotian spoke softly, sheathing Longyuan.

“Ye Xiao… do you think I don’t exist?” Ye Wudao roared, slapping Ye Xiao across the face with a palm, sending him flying.

Chapter 2245: Yeliangchen’s Choice

“Peng…” Ye Xiao collapsed, spitting blood. His gaze met Ye Wudao’s.

“Lord, this was a contest, not a life-or-death battle. Yeliangchen killed our Star River’s genius. Shouldn’t he be punished? And what of his past crimes—each could have killed him multiple times!” One elder shouted, anger in his voice.

“Indeed, Lord, your actions have wounded us city lords!” More city lords cried out.

“I said—where is the evidence?”

“Regarding Yehong’s death, you don’t know why? So many resentments—where did they come from? Star River often has missing disciples. These must be Yehong’s victims!” Ye Wudao sneered, gazing at Ye Xiao.

“Lord, you said evidence. Do you have proof Yehong killed Star River disciples?” Ye Xiao sneered, disdain in his eyes.

“Evidence has arrived!” As Ye Xiao’s words faded, two figures—black and purple—emerged from the crowd. It was Nangong Yuqing and Diaodezhu.

“Lord Nangong!” Seeing Nangong Yuqing, the crowd puzzled. They knew his ties to Luotian but hadn’t expected him to target Ye Wudao.

“Everyone, look—do any of you recognize these people?” Nangong Yuqing sneered, raising his hand. Figures appeared before the crowd—lifeless yet with open eyes.

“Human Skin Paintings!” Ye Wudao and Ye Tian’s faces darkened. Many of the figures were Star River disciples.

“My concubine!”
“Is that my daughter? What happened to them?” The city lords recognized their loved ones, faces filled with sorrow and anger.

“Lord, evidence is here. What else do you have to say?” The city lords roared.

“Everyone, these people were found in Yehong’s residence!” Nangong Yuqing spoke coldly as the city lords turned their ire toward Yeliangchen.

“Master Nangong has his ways!” Diaodezhu crossed his arms, adopting an ascetic air. His gaze met Ye Xiao’s.

“This…” Nangong Yuqing’s words left the city lords speechless, their expressions stunned.

“Rubbish! Nangong Yuqing, who doesn’t know you and Luotian are in the same boat? This is clearly a false accusation!” Ye Xiao’s face darkened.

“Another loss!” The elders sighed inwardly. They knew these people were likely Yehong’s victims.

Yehong’s twisted mindset had made him cruel, filled with hatred for all.

“Evidence! Where is the evidence?” Ye Xiao sneered. Now Yehong was dead, and he could shift blame onto Yeliangchen—no harm done, just to annoy him.

“Need evidence?” Diaodezhu sneered. He waved his hand, and black vats appeared before the crowd. Each vat had a head sticking out, weak and on the brink of death.

“Human Pillars!”

“Damn it! That’s my son!” A city lord saw a head, fury in his eyes. He leapt toward the vat.

“Limbs severed and sealed within vats—this method is cruel!”
“They live but suffer endlessly. We found these people, and the vats contained liquid that caused unbearable itching, killing them in agony!” Diaodezhu’s face bore admiration.

“Father, avenge me! Yehong captured me!” A youth spoke weakly.
“Father, kill me—this pain is unbearable! Kill me!” Other youths cried out, begging for death.

“Death deserved!” Star River disciples roared, furious. To them, this was too cruel.

“Have you all satisfied now?” Ye Wudao sneered, gazing at Ye Xiao and the elders’ darkened faces. The city lords had reclaimed their loved ones, recalling Ye Xiao’s earlier support for Yehong.

“Thank you, Disciple Yeliangchen, for avenging my son. I apologize for my earlier misunderstanding and support your candidacy as the next Lord!” A city lord spoke, gratitude in his voice. Yeliangchen had avenged them.

“Thank you, Lord Nangong!” The city lords spoke in unison. Without Nangong Yuqing’s intervention, they would still be in the dark.

“Enough, everyone. This incident has been resolved. We will compensate you for your losses, though it cannot undo your grief,” Ye Wudao spoke softly, beginning to win hearts. He had done this before—subtle and effective.

“Then we take our leave. We support Disciple Yeliangchen as Lord, but do not recognize others!” City lords rose, bowing to Ye Wudao before departing with their loved ones, declaring their stance.

“Thank you all for your efforts!” Ye Wudao smiled. These city lords were not fools; though they claimed support for Yeliangchen, they had guessed some truths and chose to leave. They couldn’t afford the internal strife of Star River.

Ye Wudao said nothing more, knowing that as long as he remained Lord, these city lords would dare say nothing.

As the city lords left, only Ye Wudao and his group remained. Below stood Star River disciples.

“Enough talk. Everyone, return!” Ye Wudao sneered, but inwardly sighed. Though Yehong was dead, only Ye Xiao and two other elders had stepped forward.

“How many elders are there? Will they accept this, or will they finally break open?” Ye Wudao mused, gazing at the elders.

“Next step!” The elders sighed deeply. Ye Xiao spoke first.

“Wait—Lord, you said we would decide the next Lord. With all three Disciples here, let’s finalize the next Lord!” Ye Xiao shouted, gazing at Ye Wudao.

“Again?” Ye Wudao smiled inwardly but felt confusion. Three Disciples—Yeliangchen, Yechen, and Luotian. Yeliangchen was his son; Luotian and Yechen were his adopted sons. Even if decided, it would be his people. Why did the elders act this way?

“Could Yechen or Luotian be their men?” Ye Wudao’s face broke into a cold sweat. If they were, it would be problematic.

He glanced at Luotian and Yechen but saw no signs.

“Come forward!” Ye Wudao sneered, addressing Luotian, Yechen, and Yeliangchen.

Luotian, Yechen, and Yeliangchen stepped forward, standing in the crowd’s view. Star River disciples watched anxiously—this was a major event.

“Who will be the next Lord? I feel all three are evenly matched. But I hope Yeliangchen becomes Lord!”

“Yechen, Star River’s first genius, I support him as Lord!”

“Luotian is strong but has been in Star River too short. It may be difficult!” People murmured, gazing at the three.

Luotian observed Yechen. He had suspicions but hesitated to believe Yechen was the elders’ man. They had spent eight years in Hell; Luotian saw Yechen as a comrade. Yet the elders’ actions hinted at hidden motives. He couldn’t be their man—only one possibility: Yechen.

“Who among you wishes to become the next Lord? Step forward!” Ye Wudao spoke softly. Though he suspected Luotian, it was just suspicion. Now came the moment of truth.

Ye Wudao’s words fell, and Luotian, Yechen, and Yeliangchen exchanged glances. Yeliangchen wore a bitter smile.

“Never thought I’d face my two brothers!” Yeliangchen spoke softly, his eyes complex.

“Idiot!” Luotian kicked Yeliangchen’s butt, sending him forward. He then addressed Ye Wudao.

“I support Disciple Yeliangchen as Lord!” Luotian spoke, gazing at Yechen. In Yechen’s eyes, he saw the complexity in Yeliangchen’s gaze.

“Huh?” Ye Wudao and Ye Tian blinked, gazing at Yechen.

Ye Xiao and other elders’ eyes gleamed with anticipation.

“Impossible!” Ye Wudao mused, but gazed at Yechen. If Yechen spoke, everything would be clear.

“I renounce the Disciple’s position!” Yechen smiled, gazing at Yeliangchen like an elder to a younger.

“Impossible!” Ye Xiao’s eyes narrowed, his mind shouting in disbelief.

Chapter 2246: Breaking the Face

“Neither?” Ye Wudao frowned, puzzled. Normally, if one of Luotian or Yechen were the elders’ men, they would have stepped forward to challenge Yeliangchen.

Yeliangchen was wounded. Either Luotian or Yechen had a high chance to defeat him, seizing the opportunity to claim Star River’s next Lord. But neither stepped forward—both chose Yeliangchen as Lord, leaving Ye Wudao confused.

“Good son!” Yet Ye Wudao smiled. Though he didn’t know who among Luotian or Yechen was the elders’ man, seeing Ye Xiao’s expression revealed their plan had gone awry. The flaw was either in Luotian or Yechen.

The elders’ eyes deepened, exchanging silent thoughts. This unexpected turn was beyond their calculations.

“Something went wrong. Where? If it truly did, is Ye Sheng’s information accurate?”

“Damn thing! We spent years nurturing him, yet he turned out a traitor.”

“Should we continue? If so, we might fall into Ye Wudao’s trap. If not, this rare opportunity would be wasted!” The elders rapidly communicated, deciding their next move without time to deliberate.

“Since Luotian and Yechen have withdrawn from the Disciple’s contest, I declare Yeliangchen as Star River’s next Lord. Upon selecting a favorable date, he will inherit the position!” As the elders whispered among themselves, Ye Wudao spoke loudly.

“Done! A century-long weakness period—we can’t wait. If this brat doesn’t recognize his place, we’ll break the face and rebel!” Ye Wudao’s words hadn’t finished when the elders decided.

“I disagree!” Ye Xiao roared, leaping forward toward Luotian, Yechen, and Yeliangchen.

“I disagree too!”
“I object!” Almost simultaneously, several figures leapt forward toward Luotian’s group.

“Yechen! You ungrateful bastard! We nurtured you for years, yet you climbed outside!” Ye Xiao’s body moved swiftly, reaching Yechen in an instant. He struck with a palm.

“Boom…” A blue hand, radiating overwhelming power, pressed down toward Yechen. Ye Xiao’s peak immortal strength fully unleashed.

At the same time, several figures rushed toward Yechen. Seven peak immortals and three late-stage immortal elders all attacked.

“Yechen!” Ye Wudao furrowed his brows, surprise in his eyes. He gazed at Yechen standing calmly.

“Elder Brother!” Yeliangchen instantly understood. Yechen was the elders’ man.

“Boom…” But the elders didn’t grant much time for shock. Ten attacks, each astonishingly powerful—Yechen wouldn’t survive even ten.

Yechen’s face remained calm. He gazed at Yeliangchen: “I’m sorry, Elder Brother. Don’t blame me!”

“He wants to die!” Luotian’s eyes flickered, seeing the ten attacks. His expression changed: “Yeliangchen, you block five, I’ll block five!”

At that moment, the three were closest. The elders’ sudden attack left no time to save Yechen—only Luotian and Yeliangchen could.

“Okay!” Yeliangchen didn’t hesitate, standing behind Yechen. Luotian stood before him, Longyuan slicing through.

“Crack…” A golden mountain was split by black sword energy. The energy also shattered a golden hand.

Yet three techniques still struck Luotian’s front, one blue fist smashing down.

“Wum…” Luotian had no time to block. He placed Longyuan before him and pressed a seal, instantly activating the Heaven-Devouring Dao Method to envelop them.

“Boom boom boom…” Three techniques struck Luotian’s body. Though the Heaven-Devouring Dao Method weakened them, they still pushed Luotian back. Meanwhile, Yeliangchen retreated constantly, his body bearing cracks. The two retreats sandwiched Yechen, who also spat blood.

“Luotian’s brat isn’t disabled, but it’s useless!” Ten elders sneered, watching the three spitting blood.

Smoke surged, engulfing Luotian’s group. Yet the ten elders continued attacking with techniques.

“Die!” Ye Wudao roared, rushing into the smoke. Ye Tian’s body radiated coldness, vanishing from sight.

Another boom echoed. The Star River platform trembled violently, leaving disciples stunned and chaotic.

“What’s happening? Why are Ye Meng’s elders attacking Disciple Yeliangchen?”

“Rebellion!” People murmured, but instantly a group of disciples roared and rushed toward the smoke.

“Just you people?” At this moment, the smoke cleared. Ye Wudao and Ye Tian stood before Luotian’s group, their gazes disdainful toward the ten elders.

“Finally emerged! I’ve doubted who gave you courage to eye my position!” Ye Wudao’s face finally showed satisfaction, gazing at the ten elders. He had lured out several big fish.

Star River had over twenty elders. Now nearly half emerged, surprising Ye Wudao.

“Star River disciples, all retreat!” Ye Wudao roared. As his words fell, elders retreated. These elders had strong strength but chose neutrality.

“Is this all of you? Since you’ve broken the face, come out fully!” Ye Wudao sneered, his voice bold.

“Ye Wudao, we know Ye Sheng is in weakness. If you relinquish power willingly, we might still negotiate. But if you persist, your faction may be expelled from Star River!” Ye Xiao roared, his voice wild.

“Yechen! You unfaithful and disloyal man. How dare you stand there?”

“Ye Wudao, did you expect this? You treated him as your own son. Yet he’s been feeding us your every move for years! Ye Sheng’s weakness is all thanks to Yechen!” A senior elder laughed, gazing at Yechen’s pale face.

“Elder Brother, is it true?” Yeliangchen gazed at him, stunned. He never thought his brother for years was a traitor.

“Yes, it’s me. My father is Ye Cheng!” Yechen spoke, his eyes red as he gazed at Ye Wudao.

“Ye Cheng!” Hearing Yechen’s words, Ye Wudao’s eyes trembled. A figure echoed in his mind before he sighed deeply.

“Of course I saw you looked like him. That’s why I named you Yechen!”

“I’ll explain later about your father’s death!” Ye Wudao spoke softly, gazing at Yechen.

“Let’s deal with this first!” Luotian patted Yechen’s shoulder. No matter what, Yechen had chosen not to stand against them at the last moment—sufficient proof. During their eight years in Hell, Luotian had formed a friendship with Yechen. He would still fight to save him.

“You should know, your ten can’t match me and Xiaotian!” Ye Wudao gazed at Yechen, not asking further. He didn’t know how much information Yechen had given them over the years.

“Of course, we have no half-Immortal King. Naturally, we can’t match you. But how much of your strength remains now?” Ye Xiao sneered, mocking Ye Wudao.

They had planned for years. The first step was to remove Yeliangchen from the Disciple position, then let Yehong become Disciple. Then they would use Yechen and Luotian’s non-heritage to let Yehong become the next Lord, a puppet. But they hadn’t expected Yeliangchen’s hidden talent—his true genius had killed Yehong.

The second step was for Yehong to fail, then let Yechen vie for the next Lord. But an unexpected event occurred with Yechen.

The third step was to break the face, using underhanded methods. If failed, they had a fourth plan.

But all relied on Ye Sheng’s weakness period. From Ye Xiao’s initial provocation, Ye Sheng hadn’t appeared—this led them to believe he was truly in weakness.

Yechen had betrayed, but his intelligence over the years hadn’t failed. Thus, they decided to gamble this time.

The third step was a poison—capable of reducing a half-Immortal King to peak immortal for three hours. Ordinary poisons were no threat to half-immortals, as their bodies had a trace of cosmic power.

“You?” Ye Wudao and Ye Tian’s faces slightly changed. They felt their cosmic power sealed, their strength dropping to peak immortal.

“Of course this is just the beginning. There’s more!” As Ye Wudao and Ye Tian’s faces darkened, a loud laugh echoed. A figure descended from the sky, appearing before them.

Dressed in Star River attire, his white hair and beard flowed. A smile graced his face—yet Luotian saw excitement in the old man’s eyes.

“Half-Immortal King! Ye Tao!” Ye Wudao’s eyes narrowed, but no surprise. He knew Ye Tao had reached half-Immortal King in his intelligence, though he hadn’t taken it seriously before.

“Brothers, we’re fighting a half-Immortal King again!” Luotian sighed deeply, his aura fierce.

Chapter 2247: Misunderstanding

The two groups faced off on the Star River platform. Ye Wudao and Ye Tian’s faces darkened—opponents had a half-Immortal King. With their current strength at peak immortal, they could suppress him—but now they were also peak immortals.

“Ye Wudao, this poison is called ‘God Bows His Head’—it seals the cosmic power in a half-Immortal King for three hours. It’s colorless and odorless. We spent much effort to obtain it!” Ye Xiao sneered, leaping toward Ye Wudao’s group.

“Blood Star Guards, attack!” Ye Tian spoke coldly. Though their strength had dropped to peak immortal, they had no choice but to fight.

“Yes…” As Ye Tian’s words fell, figures of blood stood behind him. Their bodies radiated a bloody aura, gazing at Ye Xiao’s group.

“Attack!” The disciples behind Ye Tao also roared fiercely. These were the true gamblers. If they won, it was fine; if they lost, their fate would be sealed. Ye Tao’s group had strength—though defeated, they could still stay in Star River with restrictions. But if they won, Ye Wudao and others would also be restricted.

Yet these disciples fought with all their might. If they lost, it meant death—this was why neutral elders didn’t join the fight. Victory meant ascension; defeat would weaken their faction.

“Luotian, you’ve been in Star River for short. If you don’t join this mess now, we might still let you go. I’ll even adopt you as my son and train you to be the next Lord!” Ye Tao roared, addressing Luotian. This group was a significant force; if they could be won over, it would save much trouble.

“You’re my father! Your whole family is my father! Brothers, grab your weapons and kill this old bastard!” Ye Tao’s words enraged Luotian. He never expected this old man to try to take advantage of him.

“Damn it! If you’re Luotian’s father, then you’re my grandfather. Old man, do you think you can be our elder? Did your head get smashed by the door?” Diaodezhu shouted, and Wan Lingkong also screeched. Instantly, they rushed toward Ye Tao.

Several late-stage immortals charged at the half-Immortal King. The crowd was stunned, including Ye Wudao and Ye Tian. They were bewildered—this seemed like suicide.

Ye Wudao’s lips twitched. Thinking of himself as Luotian’s adoptive father, and recalling Luotian’s words about Ye Tao, he felt uncomfortable.

Meanwhile, the Blood Star Guards and rebellious disciples began fighting. The Blood Star Guards were truly formidable—superior in strength, they easily defeated the disciples.

“Boom…” As people marveled, Luotian moved. He activated the Heaven-Devouring Dao Method and summoned a colossal figure, its body wrapped in black demonic patterns. The foot slammed down.

Overwhelming pressure made Ye Xiao’s group change expressions, their eyes filled with shock. They gazed at the descending foot, their hearts clenching.

“Roar…” Longjie pressed his hands into seals. A golden dragon, radiating immense pressure, surged toward Ye Tao.

The demon blade slashed through—Nangong Yuqing appeared like a god, his black blade slicing the sky. Li Tianzhi, Ren Hongzhe, Wan Lingkong, and Diaodezhu all unleashed their martial arts. The combined power darkened the heavens, causing Ye Tao’s face to twist in shock.

“Who gave you the courage?” Yet Ye Tao roared, a strange wave rising. In three breaths, he broke free from Luotian’s absolute suppression. He pressed his hands into seals, and a thunderous sound echoed. A sea of golden energy surged around him.

Explosions rang out—Luotian’s martial arts hadn’t touched Ye Tao yet, but they shattered in his surrounding. The invisible wave also struck Luotian’s group, pushing them back with grim expressions.

“Hmph. This old man is much stronger than the previous two!” Diaodezhu wiped his lips, blood on them. He gazed at Ye Tao standing there.

“You take the others. I’ll handle Ye Tao!” Ye Wudao roared, his hands moving. A phantom blade appeared in his hand. Ye Tian also flew forward toward Ye Tao.

Though they had been poisoned, they were still half-Immortal Kings. Their strength was there. With years of unity, they felt confident in defeating one half-Immortal King.

“Good!” Luotian nodded and didn’t refuse Ye Wudao’s words. He flew toward Ye Xiao.

“Not fighting a half-Immortal King is pointless!” Diaodezhu and others laughed, each finding their opponent. Nangong Yuqing and Longjie faced peak immortals—no problem for them. Even the幽冥八卫 combined to face a late-stage immortal. The scene became chaotic.

Yeliangchen stood beside Yechen, watching Luotian’s battle. Though he wanted to join, his body was severely wounded. Yechen also looked unwell, making him worry.

“Elder Brother, tell me—what’s wrong with you? Why have you been an informant for those elders these years? Was it me or my father who treated you poorly?” Yeliangchen spoke while recovering.

“No. Lord Ye and you treated me well. I’m very touched. But Lord Ye is the murderer of my father. Killing him is a matter of life and death!” Yechen spoke softly, his voice conflicted.

Yeliangchen watched him. Yechen had lived in hatred for years. He never met his father; since he could remember, Yechen had been raised by an elder who told him Ye Wudao was his father’s killer. Later, the elders had sent him to Ye Wudao’s side by chance.

Yechen had long hated Ye Wudao, but Ye Wudao treated him as a true son. Yeliangchen’s brother had always respected him. This was why Yechen conflicted.

For years, Yechen hadn’t been able to let go. Recently, the elders had found him again and explained their plan. Yechen had then made his decision.
