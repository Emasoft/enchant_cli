“Finally, you’ve revealed your hand!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with a faint smile as he sensed the formidable power of three martial arts techniques.

The three combat styles had reached a level comparable to Earth-level初级 or even intermediate. One technique he could face without fear, but the combined strength of three techniques posed a significant challenge even for Luo Tian.

The three martial arts radiated an overwhelming aura, darkening the sky and causing onlookers to display fear in their eyes.

Even Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu of the Yuanling Realm showed intense apprehension.

“Seems I must reveal my Emerald Crystal Jade Fire!” Luo Tian sighed, his eyes flickering with admiration. He extended his hands, and three fire dragons soared into the sky toward the three opponents.

“Earth-level?” A disciple of Wuxing Sect exclaimed, witnessing the emerald-green fire dragons. Though their aura was formidable, they seemed like a wriggling eel before the three opponents’ martial arts.

“Peng…” Within an instant, they dispersed without even touching the opponents' techniques.

Had anyone observed closely, they would have noticed that when the three fire dragons surged toward the three martial arts techniques, the latter emitted a slight tremor.

The emerald flames bloomed like fireworks, scattering sparks into the sky.

“Green fire?” The Wuxing Sect disciples finally noticed something strange and cried out in alarm.

Jiang Yucheng, Ji Yunhai, and Pei Letian narrowed their eyes. After Luo Tian’s fire dragons appeared, they felt a sudden rise in temperature. Especially Ji Yunhai, whose body was water-elemental, was particularly sensitive to fire.

At the moment the fire dragons appeared, Ji Yunhai felt his water-elemental energy within his body become uncontrollable, sending him a wave of fear.

As for Pei Letian, it was even more evident. His body possessed dual elemental attributes—wood and metal. Fire overpowered wood, especially since his recent technique was one that generated wood from metal. Now it was an unavoidable situation.

“Go!” The three shouted in unison, controlling their techniques to descend upon Luo Tian.

“Burning Heaven! Inferno Array!” Luo Tian roared, slapping his palm. A towering sea of fire instantly formed, blocking the path of their techniques.

“Too hot!” Onlookers behind the barrier felt a burning sensation.

Even the invisible barrier that had blocked their attack trembled, turning an幽green color.

“Rippling…”, the first technique was Ji Yunhai’s water-elemental style, Water Cloud Sealing Heaven.

Fire and water were incompatible. But it depended on what fire—before Emerald Crystal Jade Fire, Ji Yunhai’s water-elemental technique could only endure for less than three breaths before being consumed by flames.

Pei Letian’s attack followed, and Pei Letian bitterly realized that his technique was no less formidable than Ji Yunhai’s. Yet it vanished within a single breath, and what was worse, his technique seemed to provide additional fuel for the green flames, causing them to surge again.

The last one was Jiang Yucheng’s Three Divine Seals. This technique had been his signature move, allowing him to challenge Zhang Hongyun and others without any disadvantage.

Gold, water, earth—three elements manifested as three long dragons, their bodies entwined with countless seals, radiating a powerful sealing aura as they surged toward the fire.

“Wum…”, a continuous humming sound filled people’s ears, drawing their attention.

When the three dragons met the Emerald Crystal Jade Fire, it seemed to hesitate slightly, its flames trembling.

“Effective!” Jiang Yucheng’s face lit up with joy as he noticed the fire weakening slightly.

“Sealing power?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, puzzled why Emerald Crystal Jade Fire would fear sealing energy. According to Luo Tian’s guess, Jiang Yucheng’s technique was strong but only carried a moderate sealing aura. Even he wouldn’t fear it, so why would Emerald Crystal Jade Fire?

“Peng…”, as if confirming Luo Tian’s words, the next moment Emerald Crystal Jade Fire seemed to realize that the sealing power was powerless against it. It surged skyward, like a provoked child, instantly consuming Jiang Yucheng’s technique.

“Damn…” The three men’s faces turned pale. They hadn’t expected their combined strength to be ineffective against Luo Tian, a blow to their pride.

As the three felt some despair, a golden imperial seal appeared in the sky, as if an emperor, radiating supreme authority and enveloping them.

“Are you still going to continue?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, his eyes filled with mockery as he gazed at Ji Yunhai and the three men.

“Martial arts fusion!” The three were stunned, but Zhang Hongyun and others clearly saw how Luo Tian had formed the Imperial Seal.

Seeing the colossal imperial seal that darkened the sky, the three men looked ashen. Even with their combined strength, they had been subdued by Luo Tian—what face did they have left to continue?

“Enough!” Ji Yunhai smiled again, secretly admiring Zhang Daotian’s sharp eyes.

As Ji Yunhai spoke, Jiang Yucheng and Pei Letian also bore expressions of reluctance, surrendering. Thus ended the internal competition within Wuxing Sect.

Luo Tian chuckled lightly, waving his hand to dispel the imperial seal in the sky and walking toward the barrier.

But just as people thought it was over, a cold voice echoed in their ears: “It’s not over yet. There’s still me!”

Apologies for the delay, everyone. I overslept. Today will have five chapters, tomorrow eight, and the day after ten!

Chapter 514: Self-Explosion at the Bone-Devouring Peak

Chapter 514: Self-Explosion at the Bone-Devouring Peak

Hearing this voice, Luo Tian and the three men were slightly surprised. This voice did not belong to anyone else—it was Shui Yuqing’s.

The voice faded, and a pale blue streak of light surged toward Luo Tian with overwhelming might.

“Burn your spiritual essence!” Ji Yunhai and the others turned pale. They hadn’t expected Shui Yuqing to be so desperate.

“Not right… the speed and aura! He’s burned all his spiritual essence—he doesn’t care about life!” Jiang Yucheng’s face showed great alarm.

Luo Tian was also slightly stunned, but before he could react, Shui Yuqing’s figure appeared in front of him and launched a punch.

This punch carried years of resentment, all the spiritual essence cultivated at the Bone-Devouring Peak, and immense hatred—capable of damaging Yuanling.

Luo Tian couldn’t react in time. The punch struck his chest, causing him to stagger mentally.

“Tread…”, Luo Tian’s body retreated several zhangs before stopping, leaving deep footprints in front of him.

“Not even injured!” People watching saw Luo Tian retreat but no blood spurted, their faces filled with shock.

Luo Tian was mentally shaken. The look in Shui Yuqing’s eyes had been like a mad beast. If not for his strong body, he would have definitely been injured.

Shui Yuqing saw Luo Tian unharmed and his crimson eyes flickered in surprise. Then, a look of despair and madness appeared in his eyes.

This gaze was firmly captured by Luo Tian, causing him to mentally tremble. He activated the Six Steps of Sealing Heaven and instantly appeared in front of Jiang Yucheng, kicking him out of the barrier.

“Peng…”, Jiang Yucheng’s face showed great alarm. He hadn’t even reacted before being kicked out.

But soon, Jiang Yucheng’s face relaxed. At the moment he fell, Ji Yunhai and Pei Letian also flew out, looking quite disheveled.

“Luo Tian!” The two men were also shocked, unsure why Luo Tian had suddenly attacked them.

“Run as far as you can!” Luo Tian shouted at the people still stunned around him.

“Others can run, but you won’t!” Shui Yuqing sneered, and in the next moment, his body exploded like a ball of water, turning into an overwhelming wave of blue elemental energy within the barrier. A thunderous explosion echoed in people’s ears.

Jiang Yucheng and others hadn’t even had time to react to Luo Tian’s words before feeling a ringing in their ears, as if losing hearing.

The powerful explosion echoed within the barrier. The invisible barrier turned deep blue and seemed to expand slightly, like a ball of water, ready to unleash devastating power with the slightest opening.

“Shui Yuqing self-explosed! Everyone, run as far as you can!” Ji Yunhai quickly recovered and shouted at the people.

“Self-explosion! Then Luo Tian!” Dong Sansi’s face showed madness, looking at the barrier now filled with pale blue energy and even his spiritual sense couldn’t penetrate it.

“Luo Tian probably can’t escape. It’s a self-explosion at the Bone-Devouring Peak, and Shui Yuqing burned all his spiritual essence. Plus with the barrier opening itself, in such a small space, the explosion’s power is beyond description. Even Yuanling Peak might not withstand it.” Ji Yunhai sighed.

Hearing Ji Yunhai’s words, the Wuxing Sect disciples were mentally shaken and looked in disbelief.

“Still what are you doing? Run as far as you can! If the barrier can’t hold, Luo Tian will die in vain!” Pei Letian shouted, his gaze complex as he looked at the blue ball-like barrier.

Jiang Yucheng and Ji Yunhai felt the same. They all understood that Luo Tian had had a chance to escape but chose to kick them out before Shui Yuqing’s self-explosion. Otherwise, with Luo Tian’s terrifying speed, he could have come and gone multiple times.

Regret surged in their hearts. If it had only been Shui Yuqing, there would have been no chance for him to self-explose against Luo Tian. This situation was greatly related to the three of them.

As Pei Letian shouted, the Wuxing Sect disciples quickly retreated to a safe place.

On the main peak, Wei Mingxuan sat in the hall with his brows slightly furrowed. He hadn’t expected Shui Yuqing to hate Luo Tian so much. He stood up to rescue him, but then his brows relaxed.

“This kid’s progress in these two years has been astonishing!” Wei Mingxuan smiled lightly, picked up the tea cup beside him, took a sip, and sat back down.

Dong Sansi and others looked anxious. They could clearly feel the increasingly violent power within the barrier, restrained but unable to release.

“Why hasn’t the Sect Leader come yet!” Zhang Hongyun shouted at Jiang Yucheng.

The martial arts arena was on the main peak. Such a terrifying fluctuation, the Sect Leader Wei Mingxuan could not have failed to sense it. Even other peaks couldn’t miss it. But no Yuanling Peak peak masters had arrived, not even any Yuanling Realm experts.

“I’ve already informed my master. But… he didn’t reply to me…” Jiang Yucheng, being younger and inexperienced, almost cried.

“Now is the time to find a way to break through the barrier so this terrifying energy can be released. Otherwise, even if Luo Tian is alive, he won’t escape!” Ji Yunhai’s face was dark.

“How to break it? Can you break it? Even if your attack is stronger than a Bone-Devouring Peak self-explosion, are you sure it’s stronger?” Dong Sansi’s face showed resentment, his voice cold as he looked at Ji Yunhai and the three men.

“Boom…”, a deep sound echoed, darkening the blue sky. Thunder rumbled within the dark clouds.

“Wum…”, a powerful fluctuation passed through the clouds, causing people’s hearts to tremble slightly.

A golden light emerged from the dark clouds, growing larger and brighter. It illuminated the entire sky, revealing a golden imperial seal within the dark clouds, radiating耀眼 gold light as if carrying heavenly authority. It appeared in the sight of Dong Sansi and others.

“Tian…” The character “Heaven” was engraved beneath the golden seal, as if proving it represented Heaven itself.

Under the stunned gazes of Dong Sansi and others, the golden seal slowly descended. In the next moment, it appeared above the barrier.

Chapter 515: Barrier Shattered

The golden seal seemed to tear through space, emerging forcefully. People were in awe.

“Is this a martial art?” They looked at the golden seal in the sky and asked instinctively.

“Probably. Could it be a Heaven-level martial art from transmission?”

“I think so!”

“Who is the elder who used it?” The Wuxing Sect disciples stood at a distance, discussing among themselves.

At the same time, in the back mountains of Wuxing Sect, where five elders resided, they suddenly opened their eyes upon the descent of the golden seal. Their faces showed shock as they gazed at the massive golden seal that illuminated the entire Wuxing Sect sky.

All people of Wuxing Sect now saw the existence of the golden seal, their eyes filled with admiration and a slight trembling. They couldn’t fathom who could have unleashed such a martial art.

“Crack…”, as if thunder had suddenly sounded, a deafening explosion echoed in people’s ears.

The golden seal smashed into the barrier above the martial arts arena, causing Dong Sansi and others’ ears to ring. Some disciples of the Cultivation Body stage collapsed due to the fluctuation caused by their collision.

“Crack…”, a clear crackling sound echoed, and the barrier gradually developed fine cracks. The cracks expanded slowly.

However, the pale blue elemental energy within the barrier seemed to find an outlet. It flowed out along the cracks.

“Peng…”, the barrier could no longer withstand it. The cracks expanded, and a water-elemental energy about ten zhangs wide surged out like a blue dragon. It seemed to break free from its constraints, rising into the sky.

Under people’s astonished gazes, the blue dragon instantly soared into the dark clouds still lingering in the sky. It seemed to become a bridge connecting heaven and earth.

The crackling sounds continued until, finally, the barrier was shattered by the water-elemental energy and disappeared.

The entire martial arts arena was filled with blue water-elemental energy, stretching across the heavens and earth.

As the barrier was completely shattered, an invisible fluctuation swept over surrounding buildings. The solid houses instantly collapsed in a patch.

Dong Sansi and others didn’t care about the unsteady Wuxing Sect disciples behind them or the collapsed houses. They stared intently at the center of the martial arts arena, wanting to see if Luo Tian was still alive.

“Nothing’s wrong!” Zhang Hongyun shouted excitedly, his face showing excitement.

In the gradually fading blue elemental energy, a one-person-high emerald-green flame was burning slowly. Due to the dense water-elemental energy around it, white steam continuously appeared around the flame.

Although the water-elemental energy was very thick, it seemed to have no effect on the one-person-high emerald-green flame. The area around the flame seemed like a vacuum.

Time passed quickly, and eventually, the blue water-elemental energy dissipated completely, revealing the green flame.

“Huh…” A long sigh echoed. Then, the emerald-green flame seemed to have a soul, slowly coalescing into the size of a palm.

As the flame shrank, Luo Tian’s figure appeared in people’s sight. However, at this moment, Luo Tian was also quite disheveled. His body was charred black, his hair messy, and his body was covered with fierce wounds.

“Luo Tian!” Dong Sansi and others showed great joy. Although Luo Tian was disheveled, his vitality had not been lost at all. He stood there with bright eyes, giving people the feeling of an undefeated war god.

In the next moment, Zhang Hongyun and Dong Sansi appeared in front of Luo Tian, their eyes filled with excitement as they looked at him.

Luo Tian saw the concern in their eyes. He coughed slightly, a streak of blood spurted from his mouth, and he wore a faint smile. A fifth-grade healing pill fell into his hand and was placed in his mouth.

After the pill entered his body, a faint sound of wind and thunder seemed to echo on his flesh. Under the joyous gaze of the others, it recovered at an observable speed.

“Everything’s fine now!” Luo Tian sighed lightly. His gaze swept over the desolate ground, and he smiled bitterly.

“Thank you!” Jiang Yucheng and Ji Yunhai looked at Luo Tian with complex expressions, their voices filled with deep gratitude. Pei Letian stood there without knowing how to speak.

“Everyone is a fellow disciple of the sect. Although we are not on the same peak, we are still disciples of Wuxing Sect. It’s natural!” Luo Tian spoke gently.

“I owe you my life!” Ji Yunhai said, not continuing further. He bowed to Luo Tian.

Jiang Yucheng didn’t speak again but his eyes were resolute, filled with admiration for Luo Tian. At this moment, Jiang Yucheng no longer had his previous arrogance; he seemed like a different person.

“Take good care of Qianxue. Bring her back soon!” Pei Letian’s face was ashen, his body seemed deflated like a deflated balloon. He didn’t speak further but bowed to Luo Tian and walked away from the crowd with a desolate demeanor.

“Truly, even saying thanks is hard!” Zhang Hongyun looked at Pei Letian’s distant figure and frowned.

“I will bring Qianxue back. That day is not far!” Luo Tian spoke softly, as if to himself. However, Pei Letian, who was walking away, suddenly trembled and then continued to walk away from the crowd.

“Who exactly is this Shui Yuqing? Why does he hate you so much?” Feng Qianyu finally asked.

Hearing Feng Qianyu’s question, all the Wuxing Sect disciples showed traces of killing intent on their faces. Their eyes asked questions, looking at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s body slightly trembled. At this moment, he had already realized who Shui Yuqing was. His face showed admiration; he hadn’t expected that a common boy from the Shui family town had grown to such an extent.

Looking at the eyes full of killing intent around him, Luo Tian sighed slightly and shook his head: “I’m not too sure. I’ve offended too many people, and there are many who want my life!”

Seeing Luo Tian shake his head, the Wuxing Sect disciples felt disappointed.

“Alright, everyone. I’m fine now. I’ll stay in the Elixir Hall for three days. If anyone needs to have elixirs made, just go find Dong Sansi. I’ll make all fifth-grade elixirs for free. For sixth-grade elixirs, I also have some confidence.”

“I’ll go back to recover now. Everyone just needs to bring the medicinal herbs to Sansi!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, bowing to the surrounding Wuxing Sect disciples and speaking loudly.

When people heard that Luo Tian could make sixth-grade elixirs, their faces showed slight surprise. Then everyone’s face turned excited and disappeared from the spot.

Three days was not long, but with so many people, there would definitely be those who couldn’t get their turn. Everyone hurried back to their residences to prepare medicinal herbs, preparing for Luo Tian to make elixirs.

Chapter 516: Accommodation

Wuxing Sect, Elixir Hall, back mountains.

Luo Tian led Ning Yu’er and her daughter along the road. He smiled and greeted each disciple who waved at him, then headed toward the back mountains of the Elixir Hall.

Ning Yu’er saw the intense and respectful gazes of the Elixir Hall disciples toward Luo Tian. Even those who looked at her showed a slight respect, and she felt proud for Luo Tian.

But Ning Yu’er’s heart was somewhat uneasy. She didn’t know if the people at the place Luo Tian took her to would be easygoing.

Seeming to sense Ning Yu’er’s unease, Luo Tian gently patted her head and smiled: “Don’t worry. Once you get there, it’s like being at home. Uncle Gu is very kind!”

“Mm.” Ning Yu’er nodded slightly, loosening the grip on her sleeve and following Luo Tian.

Not long after, Luo Tian led Ning Yu’er and her daughter to the residence of the Gu family in the Elixir Hall, smiling.

“Long time no see!” Luo Tian looked at the changes in the Gu family and smiled with emotion.

In his spiritual sense, the disciples of the Gu family had improved significantly over these two years. Many had reached Cultivation Body level seven or eight, and some even advanced to the Bone-Devouring Realm.

As soon as Luo Tian stepped into the Gu family, it caused a commotion. Everyone’s faces showed great joy and surrounded Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian elder!” A girl around ten years old rushed toward Luo Tian, throwing herself into his arms. Her big eyes were full of lively charm.

Luo Tian was startled by the girl’s sudden embrace but then his gaze focused, detecting that this girl had a Cultivation Body level seven. She even surpassed some of the Gu family disciples.

“I’m Yunyao!” The girl, seeing Luo Tian’s confusion, looked disappointed.

“Uh…” Luo Tian suddenly remembered the little girl he had held in the Gu family before. He looked at her carefully, feeling a slight shock.

“Really!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, his face showing surprise. He sighed at the saying that a girl changes greatly after eighteen years and gently picked up Gu Yunyao.

“Big brother remembers me!” Luo Tian smiled lightly.

“Haha!” Gu Yunyao’s face showed pride, as if showing off to the other Gu family disciples who were around eleven or twelve years old.

“Look, I said Luo Tian elder knows me! You didn’t believe me!” Gu Yunyao’s actions made the surrounding Gu family people laugh lightly.

“Luo Tian!” A loud and cheerful voice reached Luo Tian’s ears, then Gu Yunyuan appeared before him with a happy expression.

Seeing Gu Yunyuan coming over, the Gu family disciples bowed slightly. Behind Gu Yunyuan stood Tian Bo with a smiling face and an expression of satisfaction.

Seeing Gu Yunyuan coming over, Luo Tian put down Gu Yunyao and bowed to Gu Yunyuan. Then his face was shocked.

“Uncle Gu, have you entered the Yuanling Realm?” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion as he looked at Gu Yunyuan. He hadn’t expected that Gu Yunyuan had also entered the Yuanling Realm. Five years ago, Gu Yunyuan was only at Cultivation Body level six. When Luo Tian last returned to Wuxing Sect, Gu Yunyuan was still in a coma and hadn’t seen him.

“Awakened the family’s bloodline, that’s all,” Gu Yunyuan shook his head slightly and smiled.

Luo Tian and Gu Yunyuan hadn’t seen each other for five years. Both had entered the Yuanling Realm, causing them to sigh.

“Tian Bo!” Luo Tian bowed again to the old man behind him.

“Alright, stop standing here. Let’s go inside and talk,” Tian Bo nodded and still looked like a steward, speaking to Luo Tian and others.

Under the respectful gazes of the Gu family disciples, Luo Tian, Gu Yunyuan, and several Gu family elders entered the reception hall of the Gu family.

Luo Tian briefly recounted his experiences over the past two years, causing the Gu family disciples to sigh. Even Tian Bo showed admiration.

“Since you’ve returned, stay here. I heard that the Xiangu Relic Land will open soon. You should represent Wuxing Sect to enter it and rest properly,” Tian Bo said.

“I’d like to, but…” Luo Tian sighed as he recounted Lu Kunpeng’s situation.

Upon hearing that Luo Tian would go alone to the Ice Pole Island in the Southern Region, Gu Yunyuan and Tian Bo were slightly stunned. Then their faces showed concern.

Tian Bo had recovered to the Soul-Resonance Realm after several years. Still, he spoke: “Once you reach the Southern Region, be careful. Yuanling Realm in the Southern Region is not like that of the Northern Region. In the Southern Region, Yuanling Realm is only a middle-level existence. So be careful!”

Hearing Tian Bo’s description, Luo Tian felt a sense of gravity and then his gaze became resolute.

“Luo Tian elder, don’t go! Think of another way!” Ning Yu’er had been by Luo Tian’s side, not speaking. Upon hearing the discussion about how dangerous the Southern Region was, she finally spoke out in concern.

“Who is this?” Gu Yunyuan’s brows slightly furrowed, his gaze scrutinizing Luo Tian.

“Uncle Gu, you forgot. When I first arrived at Tianyuan City, I saved a pair of mother and daughter. It was this pair of mother and daughter that led to my conflict with the Li family…” Luo Tian looked at Ning Yu’er, then recounted the story of the mother and daughter.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s account, Gu Yunyuan remembered. He had indeed met a pair of mother and daughter before. He had arranged for them to be placed in a town outside Tianyuan City, but after just settling them down, he hadn’t continued to pay attention.

Upon hearing that Luo Tian regarded this girl as his younger sister, Gu Yunyuan felt slightly relieved. After all, his daughter’s relationship with Luo Tian was already confirmed. He didn’t want his daughter to suffer any harm.

“Good, then Ning Yu’er, stay here!” Gu Yunyuan said and left Ning Yu’er and her mother.

With Gu Yunyuan’s decision, the matter of Ning Yu’er and her mother was finally settled. The Gu family disciples took them out and arranged their accommodation.

Luo Tian then learned about the current state of the Gu family with Gu Yunyuan and Tian Bo, leaving a number of elixirs behind before returning to his own residence in the Elixir Hall.

As soon as he returned home, Dong Sansi appeared at Luo Tian’s door. He handed over all the elixirs that needed to be made in one day, causing Luo Tian to sigh.

Looking at the names densely packed on the list and several storage bags filled with medicinal herbs, Luo Tian felt regretful. He had taken on too much responsibility but was also relieved that he had only said three days.

“Peng…” The Zhen Hun Cauldron fell to the ground. Emerald-green flames rushed into the fire mouth, and Luo Tian sighed as he took on labor.

Chapter 517: Re-entering Feiyan City

Three days passed quickly. Luo Tian hadn’t rested at all, finally completing all the elixirs and sighing in relief.

He stepped out of his room, gently closed the door, and walked toward Dong Sansi’s residence. As Dong Sansi’s cultivation level increased, his status in the Elixir Hall became increasingly important. He had become comparable to an Elixir Hall elder and his residence was no longer as simple as before.

As Luo Tian arrived at Dong Sansi’s door, he immediately came out with a respectful expression.

“I need to leave Wuxing Sect for a while! I don’t know how long it will take. After I leave, tell Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu!” Luo Tian spoke softly, not intending to say goodbye one by one.

After all, he had stayed in Wuxing Sect for three days. Lu Kunpeng’s situation could not be delayed. Luo Tian couldn’t determine when the poison in Lu Kunpeng’s body would erupt. If he had to say goodbye one by one, it would take more time.

Dong Sansi nodded slightly. He knew Luo Tian must have something important and didn’t ask further.

After finishing his business with Dong Sansi, Luo Tian went to Zhang Ziping and Lu Kunpeng’s residence for a brief farewell before concealing his presence and leaving Wuxing Sect alone.

“Wum…” Seven-colored wings spread out, Luo Tian flew over the sky of Wuxing Sect. He gazed at it one last time before disappearing into the sky.

...

Feiyan City. After flying for nearly a day, Luo Tian returned to Feiyan City.

Upon entering the city gates, his face showed slight surprise. The city was filled with a sense of urgency, leaving Luo Tian puzzled.

“Swoosh…” A young man around twenty saw Luo Tian and his face slightly changed. He instantly appeared in front of Luo Tian.

“Bone-Devouring初级?” Luo Tian was slightly stunned, sensing the young man’s cultivation level. He felt at ease.

Seeing Luo Tian’s confusion, the young man’s eyes showed urgency. From his storage ring, he took out a wide-brimmed hat and handed it to Luo Tian.

“Put it on and leave quickly!” The young man spoke, then disappeared from Luo Tian’s sight. This left Luo Tian surprised.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, unsure of the young man’s meaning. However, soon after, he noticed that people around him showed surprise upon seeing him. Some even exchanged glances and walked out, causing Luo Tian to gradually understand.

“Is it the backer of those people I defeated before?” Luo Tian sighed. He didn’t want to waste too much time, so he put on the wide-brimmed hat and walked into a small alley.

When Luo Tian emerged from the alley, he was now dressed as an older man.

After changing his appearance, Luo Tian walked on the main road and noticed that people’s gazes toward him had returned to normal, allowing Luo Tian to mentally relax.

“Seems I was right. Those people’s backer is issuing a wanted notice for me!” Luo Tian muttered to himself and walked toward the teleportation array.

The teleportation array had changed its guards. The five people who had been defeated by Luo Tian were nowhere to be seen.

Luo Tian arrived at the teleportation array leading to the Southern Region. He saw about fifty people waiting in line, with a fierce-looking man sitting at the front, shouting constantly.

The people waiting didn’t dare to speak. They handed their storage bags to the man, who checked them and allowed entry into the teleportation array after approval.

Luo Tian saw about fifty people ahead of him. He felt slightly impatient. He wasn’t sure how many people the teleportation array could accommodate at once or how long it would take to open.

“Ugh… wait,” Luo Tian sighed, hoping for a quick turn.

As time passed, he gradually understood that the teleportation array could accommodate one hundred people at a time. This eased his mind slightly, as he had calculated that he was exactly the one hundredth person.

While waiting无聊ly, people ahead of him gradually decreased. After about an hour, only one person remained in front of Luo Tian, causing his heart to rejoice.

“You go first!” The fierce-looking man shouted at the person in front of him, taking their storage bag.

Luo Tian approached the fierce-looking man’s seat. He had prepared a storage bag and handed it to the man, waiting for his inspection.

“Hmm…” The man took Luo Tian’s storage bag and probed it with his spiritual sense. Upon confirming the number of spiritual stones was correct, he was about to let Luo Tian enter when a commotion arose from the back of the crowd.

“Make way…” A loud shout echoed through the crowd, causing people waiting for the teleportation array to show displeasure.

But when they saw who it was, they immediately closed their mouths and showed respect, stepping aside.

“Roar…” A dragon’s roar echoed, causing people to tremble more.

“Earth Dragon pulling a carriage?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, watching the massive dragon approaching. He felt slightly alarmed.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected that in the secular world, someone could use an earth dragon to pull a carriage. The dragon before him was only at the Bone-Devouring Peak’s late stage, but it wasn’t something ordinary secular families could control. Even the second-rate sects like Kuang Dao Sect didn’t have earth dragons. This indicated that the person’s identity was extraordinary.

“Boom…” The dragon's massive body stopped before Luo Tian. A young maid dressed in a servant’s outfit stepped down from the luxurious carriage.

“This is one hundred million spiritual stones. You’ll have to wait for the next batch!” The maid’s face showed contempt, tossing the storage bag onto Luo Tian’s feet with a dismissive attitude.

Hearing the maid’s words, Luo Tian was slightly stunned. He looked at the storage bag on his feet and felt cold.

“Cutting in line?” Luo Tian smiled coldly, his eyes showing disdain. He didn’t even pay attention to the maid and spoke softly to the man in charge.

“Can I go now?” Luo Tian lightly tapped the table before the man, waking him up from his daze.

“Uh…” The people around were stunned. Their faces showed disbelief, looking at Luo Tian.

This person clearly had a high status. Luo Tian dared to ignore the maid’s words and wanted to enter the teleportation array, clearly not respecting her.

“You…” The young maid’s face showed anger. She moved instantly and kicked Luo Tian.

“Bone-Devouring Peak late stage!” People’s eyes showed admiration, looking at the carriage behind.

A maid was already at Bone-Devouring Peak late stage. What cultivation level would her master have? A deep question arose in people’s minds.

“Move aside…” But soon, people witnessed something that shocked them.

Chapter 518: Qionghua Palace
