“Who do you think he is?” Su Dan leaned against Luo Tian, her face filled with smugness.

“Brother, you truly have good fortune…” Wang Lie’s gaze shifted to Su Dan, his eyes lingering on Luo Tian with a subtle meaning. His mind was thinking that now Luo Tian had Su Dan, he would no longer have to contend with Fu Xingxuan.

Luo Tian forced a laugh, his mind racing over how to explain this to Fu Xingxuan. If he failed, he might lose more than just his skin.

They drank until midnight, and only then did everyone finally depart. After another round of teasing Luo Tian, Su Dan returned to her courtyard.

After seeing off the guests, Luo Tian’s eyes darkened as he pondered how to escape the Reincarnation Palace and return to Bountiful Heaven City. Once there, his mission would be complete. Upon reaching Bountiful Heaven City, he would finish his three-year military service and could return to Star River Prefecture.

The next morning, Luo Tian picked up his cleaning tools and resumed sweeping the Soul-Devouring Pavilion. He methodically cleaned each level.

“Master, you truly are a model for us! Even with such power, you still keep your promise to clean the Soul-Devouring Pavilion!” The disciples of the Reincarnation Palace immediately praised, their previous hostility toward Luo Tian now softened.

By day’s end, Luo Tian had reached the Reincarnation Hell, where he saw Fu Xingxuan standing on a gray long bridge.

“Xingxuan, I’m here! Did you miss me?” Luo Tian hurriedly leapt onto the bridge and chased after her.

“Hmph!” Fu Xingxuan coldly glanced at Luo Tian, her eyes filled with icy disdain.

“What’s wrong? Wife?” Luo Tian feigned ignorance, his gaze bewildered as he looked at Fu Xingxuan.

“Did you have a good time with Su Dan in the Reincarnation Realm? You two were inseparable for ten years!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes grew even colder, her gaze piercing Luo Tian as she pushed away his hand reaching for her.

“Wife, let me explain! It’s not what you think—we didn’t do anything at all! Don’t you know Su Dan by now?” Luo Tian quickly spoke, his voice laced with frustration.

“Is that true? What about the cave with Mo Yue and Mo Yang?” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes glistened, her gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

Upon hearing Fu Xingxuan’s words, Luo Tian’s heart dropped. He knew he was doomed—this time, it was truly over.

“Su Dan must have told you about this! How the hell am I supposed to explain it!” Luo Tian inwardly groaned, his face plastered with a submissive smile.

“Xingxuan, it was an emergency! We had no choice… doing what we did was already commendable!” Luo Tian shouted, his voice filled with urgency.

“I’m angry because you didn’t confess!”

“Do you know how embarrassed I was when Su Dan told me?” Fu Xingxuan’s gaze met Luo Tian’s, her eyes brimming with deep disappointment.

“I know…” Luo Tian was struck by realization, his eyes filled with guilt.

Luo Tian realized he had underestimated Fu Xingxuan; if he explained clearly, there would be no problem.

He flew to Fu Xingxuan’s side, knowing words were futile—instead, he forcefully pulled her into his arms.

“I’m sorry…” Luo Tian whispered to Fu Xingxuan, only saying three words before falling silent. No matter how Fu Xingxuan struggled, he refused to let go.

“Xingxuan, I’m leaving…” As Fu Xingxuan struggled, Luo Tian spoke again. This time, she ceased her resistance.

“Really?” Fu Xingxuan’s attention shifted, her gaze on Luo Tian, but she felt secretly pleased—Luo Tian would be out of Su Dan’s reach for a while.

In truth, Fu Xingxuan felt conflicted; she only knew about Luo Tian and Su Dan’s cave incident. At the time, she had nearly broken down.

Su Dan and Fu Xingxuan were close friends, and Fu Xingxuan knew Su Dan’s character. Su Dan truly loved Luo Tian; she wasn’t sure if Su Dan could accept their relationship.

And if Luo Tian left, it would be easy—Luo Tian was currently using the identity of Luochen.

“…”

“What’s with that expression, wife? Why are you so excited?” Luo Tian looked at Fu Xingxuan with exasperation.

Chapter 2169: I Want to Join the Army ()

“No, why would I be excited? I was going to go into seclusion in the Reincarnation Realm anyway. Just let you know, if you want to leave, go ahead—hurry up!”

“Keep training well. When I come out of the Reincarnation Realm, my strength will surpass yours—don’t fall behind!” Fu Xingxuan glared at Luo Tian.

“Don’t worry, how could I let a little girl like you surpass me? If not, how would I spank your bottom!” Luo Tian slapped Fu Xingxuan’s backside, his hand becoming mischievous again.

There are no lasting grudges between spouses. The next day, Luo Tian timidly left the Soul-Devouring Pavilion, his eyes filled with weakness.

Fu Xingxuan might have wanted to prevent Luo Tian from having an opportunity, or perhaps it was the separation—during the night, she was unusually proactive, leaving Luo Tian unable to resist.

“Feeling drained…” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with resentment, gazing at the Soul-Devouring Pavilion before heading toward Du Jianhang’s courtyard.

At that moment, Du Jianhang was seated in meditation before his sword, his aura seemingly fused with the heavens and earth, his face calm.

Luo Tian entered the courtyard without disturbing Du Jianhang, standing respectfully behind him with a respectful gaze.

Luo Tian rarely admired anyone, but Du Jianhang was one such person—his cultivation of the sword path to this level required both talent and insight.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian stood for a quarter of an hour, his mind awestruck. Within ten thousand feet, an invisible wave enveloped the area—sharp yet not overtly fierce, as if countless swords surrounded him without revealing their presence.

Yet, should Du Jianhang wish, those swords would form a lethal strike, shredding Luo Tian into pieces.

In this state, Luo Tian’s eyes reflected contemplation. He sat cross-legged, recalling his battle with Tong Heng and Du Jianming’s four swords that had left Yu Tian speechless, as well as the sword marks on the blade.

Unity of Heaven and Humanity—when Luo Tian earnestly studied something, he would enter this state, ignoring external distractions.

“Buzz…” The Dragon’s Abyss Sword emitted a radiant glow, landing in Luo Tian’s hand. He began to move it unconsciously.

As Luo Tian moved, Du Jianhang slowly opened his eyes, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

Then, Du Jianhang extended a hand, sending a sword qi toward himself. It attacked Luo Tian, and in the state of Unity of Heaven and Humanity, Luo Tian instinctively retaliated. Thus began a sparring match between the old and young within the courtyard.

However, Du Jianhang, as a sword master, was no match for Luo Tian. Yet he aimed to guide Luo Tian, helping him grasp the second level of sword cultivation swiftly.

Sword winds rose continuously; Du Jianhang’s face showed increasing surprise. He could easily sense Luo Tian’s sword strength rapidly improving.

“Terrifying… terrifying…” Du Jianhang was stunned, his sword qi attacking Luo Tian with increasing speed. Yet Luo Tian endured each attack and seemed to glean insights, growing stronger under pressure.

Du Jianhang was unaware that Luo Tian’s lifespan was no shorter than his own, and he had once reached the peak of a small world. His insight was truly terrifying.

Three hours passed, and the old and young fought for three hours. Finally, Luo Tian opened his eyes abruptly, his Dragon’s Abyss Sword flying from Du Jianhang’s hand.

“Sword is sword; I am I. The sword may fall, but I do not. If I fall, the sword remains!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with understanding. He stepped back and grabbed the Dragon’s Abyss Sword, feeling its growing acceptance of him. Now, he could suppress the demonic energy with just one-tenth of his cultivation.

“Teacher!” Luo Tian’s eyes filled with respect as he bowed to Du Jianhang.

“You have unparalleled talent!” Du Jianhang’s eyes shone with admiration, gazing at Luo Tian. To master the second level of sword cultivation in such a short time—others would take decades.

“You taught me well!” Luo Tian smiled, complimenting Du Jianhang.

“Why did you come?” Du Jianhang, sensing Luo Tian’s flattery, asked.

“I want to join the army!” Luo Tian grinned, this was their plan—returning to Bountiful Heaven City required going through the Hell Gate. Though Luo Tian didn’t want to face the Faceless Ghost, it was better than wandering through Hell.

Luo Tian knew the Reincarnation Palace might have a teleportation array to the Hell Gate, directly sending him there.

“Join the army?” Du Jianhang’s brow furrowed as he scrutinized Luo Tian. “Nonsense!”

“Do you know your identity? You are the Reincarnation Palace’s Holy Son! If something happens to you at the Hell Gate, how much would the Reincarnation Palace lose?”

“How many resources have you consumed recently? You know better than anyone!” Du Jianhang scolded.

“Stay in the Reincarnation Palace and do not leave until you become an Immortal King, succeeding as the next Grand Master. Only then can you go wherever you wish!”

Luo Tian gazed at Du Jianhang’s expression, surprised that his desire to go to the Hell Gate had caused such a strong reaction.

“Teacher, as the Holy Son of the Reincarnation Palace, I’ve done little to earn respect. I need to achieve great feats to win their trust!” Luo Tian spoke, knowing Du Jianhang would not easily let him go.

How many years until I become an Immortal King? Zhang Ziping couldn’t wait.

“Also, Du Tianming Senior Brother is your son. He went to the Hell Gate and became a commander. I’m sure he’ll take care of me there!” Luo Tian persuaded, his gaze seeking Du Jianhang’s approval.

“Don’t mention that ungrateful son! I didn’t want him to go to the Hell Gate, but he insisted. He left behind my back and nearly died several times. These years, he hasn’t dared return. When he does, I’ll beat him to death!” Luo Tian’s mention of Du Tianming only made Du Jianhang angrier.

“You think you can run too? I say no!” Du Jianhang said, then extended a hand. A sword qi entered Luo Tian’s body.

“This qi will explode the moment you leave the Reincarnation Palace—it’s powerful!” Du Jianhang smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian inwardly cursed, feeling the qi’s terror. He felt bitter—Luo Tian had planned to sneak out like Du Tianming, but Du Jianhang was experienced.

“Go! Focus on training—why join the army?” Du Jianhang kicked Luo Tian’s backside, sending him flying out of the courtyard.

“Thud…” Luo Tian landed on the ground, gazing at Du Jianhang who stood with his hands behind his back. He cursed inwardly but hung his head as he walked toward the second level’s entrance.

Passing each deputy master’s courtyard, Luo Tian felt their intense hostility. Several deputies still resented him for being a lackey, and Yu Tian glared at Luo Tian with clenched teeth, nearly ready to attack him. Yet he knew he couldn’t beat Luo Tian.

“Damn it, how can I stay here…” Luo Tian cursed inwardly as he exited the second level. Though the Reincarnation Palace disciples’ opinions of him had improved, these deputies all looked down on him.

As he thought, Luo Tian returned to his residence in the thirty-third level. A figure stood at his courtyard’s entrance, like a vibrant scenery that made every passing disciple pause.

“You’re back!”

“Where did you go? I missed you, sister! Come and properly serve me!” Su Dan strode forward, swaying her hips as she grabbed Luo Tian’s hand. Under the jealous glances of Reincarnation Palace disciples, they entered Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Go back—must go back! If this continues, I really can’t hold myself!” Luo Tian thought inwardly, feeling the warmth in his hand. Seeing Su Dan’s alluring face, he remembered the cave incident.

To be honest, Fu Xingxuan had drained Luo Tian effectively. After battling Du Jianhang for three or four hours, he was exhausted. Though Su Dan was alluring, Luo Tian lacked the strength.

After teasing Luo Tian for a while and noticing his fatigue, Su Dan gave him a sultry glance before leaving.

“You’re such a fool! Just say you like me, and I’d have accepted! Why force me to take matters into my own hands?” Su Dan left Luo Tian’s courtyard, inwardly annoyed. She had been so proactive, yet this Luochen remained indifferent.

From the start, Su Dan had intended to use Luo Tian, but after experiencing the Reincarnation Realm, her view of him changed. She knew he was a man worthy of herself.

“How to leave?” Luo Tian sat on his bed, pondering endlessly.

“Boy, what’s troubling you?” A voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, startling him.

“Bountiful Heaven Stone!” This voice had been long absent. After Bountiful Heaven Stone cast Luo Tian before the Black and White Wuchang, it had vanished. Luo Tian had tried contacting it several times but to no avail—now it had returned.

Chapter 2170: Catch Up ()

Chapter 2170: Catch Up

“Where are you? Come out, you bastard!” Hearing Bountiful Heaven Stone’s words, Luo Tian grew angry, scanning around for its location.

“Boy, let’s talk reasonably—after all, you are my master, right?” Bountiful Heaven Stone spoke hesitantly.

“Did you consider me your master? Yin Yu the bastard even protected me before rebelling, but you just threw me there. That’s not betrayal—it’s devouring your master! I survived because of my great fortune!” Luo Tian cursed.

“Why do you care?” Yin Yu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, unenthusiastic.

“What kind of things are you? Have you ever had such a master!” Luo Tian raged more, his anger growing.

After cursing for an hour, Luo Tian finally stopped, panting as he looked around. Since he started cursing, Bountiful Heaven Stone had said nothing.

“Are you still there?” Luo Tian felt exhausted, shouting into the room with anger.

“Did you finish cursing?” Bountiful Heaven Stone’s lazy voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, but it still didn’t appear.

“Am I your master!” Luo Tian saw Bountiful Heaven Stone still hadn’t shown up, his anxiety rising. His eyes gleamed as he thought of an escape plan.

“Last time was a mistake—who could have known there were two Immortal Kings here? That’s playing with me!”

“Boy, you want to leave, right? I can help! I’m also tired of this Reincarnation Palace!” Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Where have you been these days?” Luo Tian frowned, sensing Bountiful Heaven Stone had gotten into trouble. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have proactively sought him out.

“I’m fine—just wandering around. I missed you!” Bountiful Heaven Stone spoke hesitantly.

“I can’t leave—once I do, the qi in my body will explode and kill me. Stay here!” Luo Tian spoke softly, surprised he hadn’t escaped after visiting Du Jianhang but was now trapped.

“I have a plan—say whether you want to leave or not!” Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice was triumphant.

“Of course I want to leave!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up, quickly responding.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian’s words finished, waves rose before him. Red light appeared around him—red stone landed at his feet: Bountiful Heaven Stone, long vanished.

But this Bountiful Heaven Stone was vastly different from the one he had taken from the Reincarnation Palace. It radiated divine laws, containing countless laws.

“How have you changed?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion as he gazed at Bountiful Heaven Stone.

“Haha, did my handsome appearance scare you?” Seeing Luo Tian’s confusion, Bountiful Heaven Stone laughed, moving around him with pride.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with sharpness as he grabbed Bountiful Heaven Stone, his gaze dangerous.

“Finally caught you! I’ll throw this devoured master into the latrine today!” Luo Tian roared, leaping up and rushing out of the room toward the thirty-third level’s Soul-Devouring Pavilion.

“Damn it, boy! You tricked me!” Bountiful Heaven Stone’s curses echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, but he clung tightly.

Now Luo Tian understood: this Bountiful Heaven Stone could not turn to dust in his hands, as he had carried it for nearly a month without it turning to dust.

“Is that the Holy Son? He’s going to clean the Soul-Devouring Pavilion again?”

“Unexpectedly, the Holy Son is so eager to clean it…” People gazed with admiration as Luo Tian carried Bountiful Heaven Stone toward the Soul-Devouring Pavilion.

A moment later, Luo Tian reached the latrine behind the Soul-Devouring Pavilion, his eyes sneering.

“You bastard, dare to let me go—let’s fight!”

“Damn it, you’re throwing the great Bountiful Heaven Stone into the latrine! That’s an insult to me, to all!” Bountiful Heaven Stone cursed endlessly, but Luo Tian remained unmoved.

“Master, I’m sorry—please don’t throw me there!” Bountiful Heaven Stone finally surrendered, begging Luo Tian. Luo Tian guessed correctly: he had caught it and could not transform, nor could it leave him too far—after all, Luo Tian was now its master.

“Speak up! Tell me what you’ve been doing these days—don’t think of lying. If you tell the truth, I’ll consider it!” Luo Tian tightly held Bountiful Heaven Stone, speaking to it.

“I didn’t do anything…”

“Ah… damn it! Boy, hurry up and get me away from this thing—my cleanliness is offended!” Before Bountiful Heaven Stone finished speaking, Luo Tian moved his hand down slightly.

“What is this Bountiful Heaven Stone? I’ll turn you into a stone in the latrine today!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with mischief.

“Say it! I’m sorry, you’re so strong! Please take me out!” Bountiful Heaven Stone cried out, its voice trembling.

“Say it first!” Luo Tian looked like he had Bountiful Heaven Stone cornered, not moving.

“I went to the Reincarnation Palace’s treasure vault… I ate some things!” Bountiful Heaven Stone finally spoke honestly.

“…”

“You bastard, you ate alone!” Luo Tian was speechless, then cursed furiously. He felt betrayed after enduring so much suffering.

“Big brother, master… dear master, I’ve strengthened—don’t you also benefit?” Bountiful Heaven Stone saw Luo Tian’s anger and quickly explained.

“Wait, you entered the Reincarnation Palace’s treasure vault? How much did you take?” Luo Tian suddenly sensed something was wrong.

“Not much… I must say, the Reincarnation Palace’s treasure vault is quite good. It restored some of my strength. I didn’t eat much—just a few soul essences, a few mineral veins… and several upper-grade ghost weapons. I also absorbed some divine essence from the weapons…” Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice grew quieter as it felt Luo Tian’s trembling hand, fearing he might accidentally throw it into the latrine.

“You’ve robbed them all!” Bountiful Heaven Stone’s words—each one was priceless. Luo Tian’s eyes darkened, nearly falling into the latrine himself.

“Run! You must run—otherwise, when the Grand Master finds out, he’ll skin me!” Luo Tian trembled, thinking of an Immortal King’s fury. His legs went weak.

“Do you have a plan to escape? Can you handle the qi in my body?” Luo Tian asked Bountiful Heaven Stone.

“Of course!” Bountiful Heaven Stone quickly replied, knowing Luo Tian understood the urgency.

“Now! Immediately!” Luo Tian commanded Bountiful Heaven Stone, sending divine laws and forbidden seals—any that could be used were placed on Bountiful Heaven Stone. He was truly afraid it would run away and abandon him.

After setting the seals, Luo Tian flew toward Ye Chen’s direction. At that moment, Ye Chen was consolidating his cultivation. Seeing Luo Tian rush out in a hurry, Ye Chen’s face slightly tensed—he had never seen Luo Tian like this before.

“Wait, when you leave the Reincarnation Palace, don’t ask why—go now!” Luo Tian told Ye Chen. After speaking, he vanished from Ye Chen’s sight.

Ye Chen widened his eyes, stunned. He rubbed his eyes, disbelievingly watching Luo Tian’s direction.

“My god, what kind of technique is that!” Ye Chen exclaimed in awe, standing motionless.

“Go! Don’t delay or you’ll die!” As Ye Chen was stunned, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his mind, making him startle.

“Go!” Ye Chen leaped into the air, flying toward the Reincarnation Palace’s exit. He quickly passed layer after layer, and in a moment, he burst out of the Reincarnation Palace.

Ye Chen’s sleeve had a tiny particle of dust clinging to it—Bountiful Heaven Stone.

At this moment, Luo Tian was on the red earth, carefully observing the qi inside his body. Yet it hadn’t exploded after leaving the Reincarnation Palace.

“Little bastard!” As Luo Tian flew out of the Reincarnation Palace with Ye Chen, Du Tianming sensed it and cursed. But he didn’t stop him.

“Little bastard, this qi can save your life at the crucial moment—don’t lose it. Go find that ungrateful son and slap him twice!” Du Jianhang’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears through the qi.

Luo Tian felt warm, sensing the qi inside him was no longer terrifying but gentle.

“Bastard! Who is it!” As Ye Chen just flew out of the Reincarnation Palace, a furious pressure swept across nine heavens and ten earths.

The world changed, the sky inverted—within miles, a powerful pressure enveloped everything. This pressure made all realms tremble. Each deputy master’s face showed shock.

“Surely that bastard! I’ll skin your hide!” The figures of Black and White Wuchang appeared above the Reincarnation Palace, taking a step and vanishing from their place.

“What’s happening? Who made the Grand Master so angry—this is the first time!”

“Did he find that guy from the Reincarnation Realm?” People’s faces showed confusion, whispering among themselves.

“Close call—just barely avoided being caught in his domain! An Immortal King’s domain spans ten miles!” Luo Tian was stunned.

But before he finished speaking, a figure appeared directly above Ye Chen’s head.

“Grand Master…” Ye Chen trembled, gazing at the Black and White Wuchang above. Even as a prodigy from Star River Prefecture, he had never seen an Immortal King’s strength before. That was a presence equal to the nine Immortal Kings.

Chapter 2171: Capture ()

“Grand Master…” Ye Chen was stunned, gazing at the Black and White Wuchang above. Though they had no aura, their presence made him fear.

“What are you going to do?” The Black and White Wuchang spoke, seemingly addressing Ye Chen but actually targeting Luo Tian.

“Damn it, how did he reach the Immortal King level!”

“Done! Done… this is over…” Bountiful Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, trembling with fear.

“I… I…” Ye Chen stammered, unsure how to answer, his gaze fixed on the Black and White Wuchang.

“Buzz…” As Ye Chen couldn’t speak, Bountiful Heaven Stone didn’t hesitate and pushed Luo Tian out. In an instant, Luo Tian appeared in front of Ye Chen and the Black and White Wuchang.

“This…” Seeing Luo Tian suddenly appear beside him, Ye Chen was startled.

At this moment, Ye Chen understood why Luo Tian had rushed out—because he had offended the Grand Master. Thinking of this, Ye Chen’s legs went weak.

“Bastard!” Luo Tian inwardly cursed but smiled politely, gazing at the Black and White Wuchang descending from the sky. He continuously used forbidden seals he had placed on Bountiful Heaven Stone, but it showed no reaction. He could only vaguely sense its location.

“Respect the Grand Master!” Luo Tian didn’t look at Ye Chen but bowed respectfully to the Black and White Wuchang.

“Luochen, are you overstepping? I’ve been kind to you—yet you betray me by stealing my Reincarnation Palace’s treasure vault?” The Black and White Wuchang spoke coldly, wanting to slap Luo Tian.

“Grand Master, I’ve never stolen anything! I came out because I wanted to repay your kindness by going to the Hell Gate and fighting!” Luo Tian quickly spoke, defending himself.

“He stole the Reincarnation Palace’s treasure vault…” Ye Chen trembled as he listened to Luo Tian and the Black and White Wuchang’s conversation, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

“What kind of courage does he have!” Ye Chen was completely convinced by Luo Tian—he had followed him from the Heavenly Destruction City to the Reincarnation Palace, witnessing Luo Tian’s countless shocking deeds. Even with his arrogance, Ye Chen admitted he couldn’t match Luo Tian.

“Fart! You think I’m stupid, giving you this!”

“You son of a bitch—what identity do you have? You know I don’t trust you. You claim to go fight the Heavenly Realm at the Hell Gate, but you won’t admit it! Look—what is this!” The Black and White Wuchang cursed, waving their hands. A series of images appeared before Luo Tian and Ye Chen.

A series of treasures floated in the image—this was the Reincarnation Palace’s treasure vault.

“Great Golden Essence… Yin Emperor Stone…” Luo Tian and Ye Chen breathed heavily, staring at the treasures in the image.

But a red stone disrupted this beautiful scene. The crimson stone grew larger, eventually forming a mouth that began to chew the treasures.

“Don’t tell me you don’t know this stone!” The Black and White Wuchang looked at Luo Tian with mockery, their hearts bleeding.

“Bastard! You’re a beast!” Luo Tian cursed too, his eyes filled with anger.

“Again this stone!”

“Grand Master, please see reason! I don’t know this stone at all. When I obtained Longyuan, it followed me—there was nothing I could do!” Luo Tian cried out in innocence, truly having gained nothing.

“Liar! This is your thing! I’m not stupid—give me back!” The Black and White Wuchang grabbed Luo Tian, lifting him like a chicken, and walked toward the Reincarnation Palace. Ye Chen was left alone in confusion.

Luo Tian cried out, trying to send Bountiful Heaven Stone away—he had realized it was a troublemaker. It might cause more problems in the future.

“Finally, someone to trap this bastard!” Yin Yu watched Luo Tian being carried by the Black and White Wuchang, feeling satisfied.

In an instant, the Black and White Wuchang returned with Luo Tian to the Reincarnation Palace, causing people’s surprise. No one knew why they had returned with Luo Tian.

“Deserved! Look at the Grand Master’s anger—this time, he’ll die or lose a layer of skin!”

“What did the Holy Son do? Why is the Grand Master so angry!” The disciples of the Reincarnation Palace wondered, watching the Black and White Wuchang bring Luo Tian to the first level of the Reincarnation Palace.

“Bring the eight deputy masters!” As soon as they returned to the first level, the Black and White Wuchang sent a mental message to the eight deputy masters.

He needed to inform them—this was not his decision alone; he couldn’t decide everything. The theft of the treasure vault had offended others’ interests.

Almost immediately after hearing the Black and White Wuchang’s mental message, the eight masters entered the first level from the second. Their faces showed confusion as they gazed at Luo Tian standing there. They naturally knew about the Black and White Wuchang’s anger, and this was the first time they had seen them so furious. The last time they were this angry was during the Ten Palace Competition when they were humiliated.

“Look!” The Black and White Wuchang waved their hands, showing the images they had shown Luo Tian to the eight deputy masters.

“My Yin Ming Water—this was my treasure I planned to exchange in a month! Damned!” One of the Heaven Kings gritted his teeth, watching a bucket of black water being swallowed by Bountiful Heaven Stone.

“Damned! This stone is the one Luochen brought!” Other Heaven Kings’ faces were angry, gazing at Luo Tian. They certainly knew this stone was connected to him.

“Respect the Grand Master!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, gazing at those Heaven Kings who despised him. He knew he might not survive this.

Du Jianhang’s face showed a bitter smile, watching his eccentric disciple. He had no reason to defend Luo Tian this time.

At that moment, Du Jianhang understood why Luo Tian wanted to go to the Hell Gate so desperately—it was clearly an escape plan.

“Grand Master, this Luochen is a troublemaker! I suggest stripping him of his Holy Son status and erasing his soul to become the fertilizer for the Otherworldly Flowers!” Fire Heaven King Yu Tian was excited. He couldn’t miss this chance to kill Luo Tian, who had self-destructed.

At that moment, Yu Tian didn’t care about anything else—just wanted to kill Luo Tian to vent his anger. As for Longyuan and other treasures on Luo Tian, Yu Tian didn’t care anymore.

“Too harsh!” Luo Tian glared at Yu Tian, his face darkening with killing intent.

Yu Tian’s words caused the hall to fall silent, even the Black and White Wuchang looked at Yu Tian.

“Everyone, what do you think?” The Black and White Wuchang looked at the deputy masters, a hint of amusement in his eyes.

But the deputy masters remained silent, finally focusing on Du Jianhang. Though they disliked Luo Tian, they knew he wasn’t easy to kill—after all, his back was Du Jianhang. Also, the Black and White Wuchang’s attitude had been ambiguous.

If they truly wanted to kill Luo Tian, they would have done so already. But now they had returned him—clearly, the Black and White Wuchang didn’t want to kill Luo Tian but sought a way out.

The incident of Du Jianhang’s four swords injuring Yu Tian was still fresh in their minds. Du Jianhang was the oldest Heaven King of the Reincarnation Palace; sometimes, even the Black and White Wuchang gave him some face.

“Grand Master, as a Holy Son, his status is equal to ours. He’s also the next Grand Master of the Reincarnation Palace. Killing him would be a pity!”

“Though I am his master, if he did something harmful to the Reincarnation Palace, I would have no choice but to act against him!”

“Now with the Ten Palace Competition approaching, Grand Master has ascended to the Immortal King peak. We eight have surpassed other palaces. With the Holy Son and Holy Daughter, as well as the Eight Little Heaven Kings, we can easily compete for two layers of Hell!”

“If we kill the Holy Son now, it would be very detrimental to the Ten Palace Competition!”

“Therefore, I suggest that his death penalty is forgiven but he must bear the punishment. Let him achieve top three in the Ten Palace Competition to be pardoned. If he doesn’t make it into the top three, we’ll punish him later!” Du Jianhang spoke, gazing at the Black and White Wuchang.

“Indeed, my dear master!” Luo Tian felt touched by Du Jianhang’s words. Since he came to the Reincarnation Palace, Du Jianhang had given him so much—without Du Jianhang, he might have died many times!

“Hmm, that makes sense. Does anyone else have other opinions?” The Black and White Wuchang nodded, then looked at the other deputy masters.

“Grand Master, in secular terms, it’s said that even the emperor must abide by the law. If the Holy Son made a mistake, can he atone for it?” Yu Tian wouldn’t let go.

“Yu Tian, you’re so biased! How can a Heaven King lack tolerance?” Du Jianhang’s face showed coldness, addressing Yu Tian.

“Master Du, I’ll slap you a few times—what about your tolerance?” Yu Tian sneered, his voice filled with contempt.
