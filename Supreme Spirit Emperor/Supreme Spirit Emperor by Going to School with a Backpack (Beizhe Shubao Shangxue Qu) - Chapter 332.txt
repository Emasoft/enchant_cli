“Boom... Boom... Boom...” Seven streams of sword qi clashed with seven waves of blade energy, each explosion resonating through the heavens, shaking the entire Seven Star Island. The violent gusts battered Luo Tian and Guan Xingjian, forcing them to retreat step by step.

“He blocked it!” The crowd erupted in excitement, their eyes burning with anticipation as they watched the two combatants on the Seven Star Stage. Witnessing such a clash was an event unparalleled in millennia.

“Eighth strike!” Guan Xingjian’s eyes flashed with madness as he saw Luo Tian deflect his attack. He spat blood onto the golden sword forged from Epoch Power.

A resonant hum echoed as the sword abruptly shifted, its radiant gold transforming into a sinister crimson. At the moment the blood-red blade materialized, all swords within the Sword Nation trembled violently, emitting a low hum.

Guan Xingjian swung his crimson sword with ferocious grace. The blood-colored blade surged forward at blinding speed, sending Luo Tian into a spiral of dread—only one force could instill such fear in him: the might of an Epoch.

“Incredible! It wields a fragment of Epoch Power!” Within the courtyard, five elders stood frozen, their expressions etched with disbelief. Even they would have paid a heavy price to withstand this strike.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed as he swiftly formed hand seals, sending out strange ripples from his palms. The crowd murmured in confusion.

“What is Luo Tian up to? If I’m not mistaken, he still has the ‘Martial Seven Steps’ left!” Hu Tianzong murmured.

“Indeed! If he uses the Martial Seven Steps, it should be manageable!” Yang Jinghua nodded, recalling how Luo Tian had crushed a royal prodigy with the technique in the Sea’s Edge. The memory still sent shivers down his spine.

The crimson sword qi instantly cleaved through the heavens, slicing toward Luo Tian. Before it could touch him, his wounds burst open again, blood gushing forth.

“Hundred zhang... Ten zhang…” Luo Tian stared at the crimson blade, his hands slightly extended as if grasping for something unseen.

“Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique!” At the moment the crimson blade was a mere zhang away, Luo Tian thrust his hands forward with a roar.

“Wail…” A mournful sound echoed from the crimson blade, as if it lamented its fate.

“Is this the third inheritance of the Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique?”

“The clash between the First Island’s Sword Heaven and the Third Island’s Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique! This is unprecedented!” The crowd erupted in excitement, their eyes alight with fervor.

“Crack…” Under the thrumming anticipation of the crowd, the crimson blade abruptly halted before Luo Tian. A series of cracks echoed as it shattered.

In an instant, the blade’s tip exploded, its body riddled with fractures. One by one, it crumbled into crimson fragments, vanishing from sight.

“Still not enough,” Luo Tian frowned, gazing at the shattered fragments. He had intended to turn the blade back against Guan Xingjian, but his power was limited. Though he had deflected the strike, it hadn’t achieved his desired outcome.

Still, the crowd roared. The inheritance of the First Island’s Sword Heaven, the Eighth Strike of the Nine Swords, had fallen to the Third Island’s Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique.

“How is this possible?” Guan Xingjian’s eyes widened in disbelief. He knew the power of his Eighth Strike—even an Epoch-Middle realm cultivator would have paid a heavy price to withstand it. Yet Luo Tian had emerged unscathed, an impossibility that left Guan Xingjian reeling.

“Continue?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smile as he gazed at Guan Xingjian. He sensed the terror of the Ninth Strike, yet he was certain Guan Xingjian could not unleash it.

“I yield,” Guan Xingjian’s eyes dimmed with defeat. Luo Tian was correct—the Ninth Strike was formidable, but Guan Xingjian could not wield it. The technique allowed only three uses in his lifetime.

Though resentment festered within him, Guan Xingjian knew they were both human. This was a contest, not a life-or-death duel. He doubted whether Luo Tian could withstand the Ninth Strike.

“From now on, our debts are erased,” Guan Xingjian murmured, raising his hand. The Sword Nation shattered with a resounding crack. His azure sword returned to his grasp, slung across his back.

“Brother Guan’s magnanimity!” Luo Tian’s eyes softened with regret as he clasped his fists, bowing respectfully to Guan Xingjian.

“Brother Guan has yielded!” As Guan Xingjian’s words echoed, the crowd erupted in chaos. Their gazes turned to Luo Tian.

“Does that mean the Second Island’s Deputy Leader has become the top of our generation?” The crowd’s eyes gleamed with admiration.

“Indeed! With injuries, he still defeated Brother Guan. What power must the Deputy Leader possess?” The Third Island’s disciples stared at Luo Tian with fervent eyes.

“An abomination!” Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua exchanged glances, murmuring. They knew Luo Tian still had hidden techniques.

“Enough! Since it’s over, we must act. I’ve been waiting impatiently!” Xuan Bingshou smiled, addressing the four.

“Good,” they nodded. Their bodies flashed into five streaks of light, appearing at the four corners of Seven Star Island.

“All Epoch-Initial realm cultivators, join me. Today, we shall relocate Seven Star Island!” Xuan Bing’s voice rang across the island, causing every disciple to pale.

Chapter 1351: Activating the Void Warship

“Relocate?”

“Where? Could those rumors from two days ago be true?” Upon hearing Xuan Bing’s words, the crowd stirred.

“Correct. We truly must relocate. The rumors were genuine—we are returning home, to the Nine Realms, to our human domain!”

“For years, our ancestors have yearned to return. Yet one thing always hindered us.”

“Recently, the Third Island’s Deputy Leader brought back an object. Now, returning to the Nine Realms is no longer a dream!” Taiyang Jian’s voice trembled with emotion, echoing across Seven Star Island.

The island fell silent for a moment before resounding cheers erupted. Everyone was overjoyed, shouting with excitement.

Seven Star Island was the last human bastion in the Origin Star Domain. Though the蛮族 had not attacked for years, they knew their strength was no match against the Ancient Multitudes. It wasn’t that the Ancient Royal Clans didn’t wish to eradicate them—it was a matter of cost. Thus, the human inhabitants of Seven Star Island had long lived in fear, dreading the day the蛮族 would descend upon them without mercy.

Now, that fear was gone. How could they not be elated? Some elders even wept, recalling the days of war with the蛮族. They had longed for peace.

“Luo Tian!” Someone shouted, gazing at Luo Tian standing on the Seven Star Stage. Their eyes held gratitude.

“Luo Tian!” Another voice echoed, and soon the entire island’s people fell to their knees before Luo Tian. At this moment, he deserved their reverence. Even Guan Xingjian knelt before him.

“Brother Guan, don’t kneel! I can’t bear it!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed as he lifted Guan Xingjian.

“Everyone, don’t do this. I merely wished to return to the Nine Realms!” Luo Tian sighed softly, his voice tinged with emotion. Including his time in the Southern Ridge Stone寨, he had spent four years in the Origin Domain.

Four years—every moment he yearned to return. He missed his wife, children, parents, and friends.

“Woo…” A resonant hum echoed. Suddenly, the void ruptured, and a radiant warship burst forth, its vast form blotting out the sun.

“This is our ancestral void warship. With it, we can return to the Nine Realms!” Taiyang Jian spoke softly, gazing at the colossal vessel.

The moment the warship appeared, the islanders’ faces reflected awe. They had never imagined their elders harbored such grand ambitions.

“We shall now move the entire Seven Star Island onto the warship. There will be some tremors—do not panic!” Taiyang Jian spoke softly, his body flashing to the island’s edge.

Luo Tian, Guan Xingjian, and others of the Epoch-Initial realm also flashed to the island’s edge, their eyes alight with smiles.

One Elder of Epoch-Middle, four Elders of Epoch-Middle, and Luo Tian—seven in total—surrounded the island.

“Rise!” Xuan Bingshou spoke softly, his aged hands grasping at the void. A surge of power rippled through the island’s inhabitants.

“Rise…” As Xuan Bingshou’s words echoed, Luo Tian and the others unleashed their power, moving the island.

“Boom…” The island trembled as it lifted from the ground, slowly drifting toward the colossal void warship.

“Open!” Xuan Bingshou pointed his hand, and a surge of cold Epoch Power erupted, striking the warship.

“Woo…” The warship resonated with light. Glowing energy veins pulsed like dragons across its surface.

The light blazed, enveloping the entire Seven Star Island. In an instant, it vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

“An amazing void warship!” Luo Tian marveled. He had heard Taiyang Jian’s explanation before.

Though the ship seemed small compared to a continent, it was vast within—like an independent realm. It could easily accommodate the entire Seven Star Island.

“Rippling… Rippling…” As the island vanished, the sea surged backward, forming a towering wave that submerged the original location of Seven Star Island.

“Good. Now we must relocate the Seven Star Sea,” Xuan Bingshou addressed Longjing.

“Let’s go!” Longjing smiled, nodding to Xuan Bingshou before flying toward the island’s edge.

But as they took their first steps, a thick scent of blood suddenly filled their nostrils. Their bodies halted mid-air, eyes filled with confusion.

“Rippling… Rippling…” The waves gradually calmed. In an instant, their eyes darkened.

Before them, the calm sea had turned blood-red. A faint scent of blood emanated from it.

Among the red water, corpses of sea creatures floated. Their hearts jolted in alarm.

“What’s happening?” Longjing’s face paled, his gaze darkening. He flashed beyond the island’s boundaries.

The Seven Star Sea roared with waves. Three Epoch-Middle realm cultivators stood at its edge, their eyes filled with disdain.

They were reinforcements sent by the three royal clans. Behind them stood the three Epoch-Middle realm cultivators who had once pursued Luo Tian.

Further back, six Epoch-Initial realm cultivators stood. Their eyes held contempt as they unleashed attacks, felling countless sea creatures with each strike.

“Which clan are you from? Why attack us?” A trembling voice echoed. The sea creatures and beasts were too numerous to count, yet each attack meant the death of thousands.

“You are the first line of defense for Seven Star Island’s humans? How weak!” The six Epoch-Initial realm cultivators spoke, their hands never ceasing.

“Ah…” Cries of agony echoed. The entire Seven Star Sea was being slaughtered, its creatures powerless against these masters.

“Go fetch the elders! The elders are within Seven Star Island!” A sea dragon of Epoch-Initial realm pushed aside a younger disciple, sending him away. His massive body then crashed into the waves, surging toward them.

“Fight back!” Roars echoed as countless sea beasts gathered, charging at the attackers. They unleashed radiant beams, creating waves that surged toward them.

Behind them stood thirty million Ancient Multitudes. Their faces bore contempt as they roared.

Kill intent surged. These thirty million warriors, ten thousand from each clan, were elite among elites—no match for the Star Moon Clan’s Star Moon Guards. Even the weakest among them was an Overwhelming Realm cultivator.

In contrast, though the sea beasts were numerous, they would not necessarily match these elites. Moreover, before them stood several overwhelming forces. In a short time, nearly a million sea creatures were crushed by their attacks.

“Mere insects. Push forward. I want to see what makes Seven Star Island’s humans so special. The蛮族 have failed for years!” One Epoch-Middle realm cultivator spoke, his voice laced with disdain. His hands glowed as he pushed the blood-red sea.

The others did likewise, and the entire Seven Star Sea turned upside down. The waves were annihilated, countless sea beasts crushed by their might.

As they pushed forward, another wave of water surged toward them. This was organized by the sea beast’s Epoch-Initial realm cultivator.

But the disparity in strength made their waves unequal. In an instant, both waves collided.

The thunderous explosion echoed as blood splattered. At the collision point, countless sea beasts were crushed by the overwhelming force.

“Ah…” Cries of anguish echoed. But there was no choice—two forces were too imbalanced. The sea beasts’ wave weakened, and they knew their fate if consumed.

“Ah…” Just as the beasts could not endure, a mournful cry echoed across the Seven Star Sea. A massive figure surged forth, leaping into the sea beasts’ side.

“Elder!” The sea dragon roared, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Damn! It’s the Ancient Multitudes!” At the same time, Luo Tian and others appeared on the Seven Star Sea. Their eyes darkened upon sensing the figures behind the waves.

Chapter 1352: The Killing Array Reveals Its Might

“Get out…” Longjing instantly returned to his true form, a massive body. He exhaled a surge of Epoch Power, sweeping the heavens as he directed it toward those pushing forward.

“This is the old sea dragon they spoke of!” One Epoch-Middle realm elder sneered.

“Too weak. Only an Epoch-Middle realm cultivator!” The elder observed the massive wave, then waved his hand.

Wind surged. The violent waves collapsed into crimson waterfalls, falling back into the sea.

“Fall back! Retreat into Seven Star Island!” Longjing commanded the remaining sea beasts, his massive body standing before them.

“Elder!” The sea beasts roared, gazing at the dragon who shielded them.

“Go. Let us protect the lineage of Seven Star Sea!” Xuan Bingshou and others appeared before the beasts, their eyes heavy as they faced the Ancient Multitudes.

“Finally, some real people!” A Blood Clan Epoch-Middle realm elder spoke, his eyes filled with contempt as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s heart tightened. He recognized the three royal clans—those who had once pursued him. Though three Epoch-Middle realm men were present, others had changed.

“Blood Clan, Hun Tian Clan, Qilin Clan!” Yun Wuyi and others’ faces darkened. The opposing forces brought immense pressure.

“Tu Lekang, Hun Xuefeng, Qi Hongyun!” Xuan Bingshou’s face darkened as he named the three Epoch-Middle realm elders.

Upon seeing Luo Tian, the royal clan’s forces halted their attacks. The sea beasts were mere insects to them; if they killed Luo Tian and the others, the rest would be easy prey.

“Ah, it’s that Xuan Bingshou. I didn’t think you were still alive!” The Qilin Clan’s Epoch-Middle realm elder, Qi Hongyun, smiled, recognizing Xuan Bingshou.

“Did you evolve?” Qi Hongyun murmured. The Qilin Clan had once been beasts, and with so few Epoch-Middle realm cultivators in the Origin Domain, it was hard to miss.

“You’re still alive. How could I die?” Xuan Bingshou coldly replied, his aura radiating chill as he sent a mental message to Luo Tian.

“Buy time. Enter Seven Star Island’s interior. There is an ancient killing array; they cannot enter!” Xuan Ming’s voice echoed in their minds.

Luo Tian nodded. With three Epoch-Middle realm and three Epoch-Initial realm forces, they could not match them. They had to buy time until the sea beasts fully retreated into the island.

“Hope only these forces come,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, gazing at the void. These enemies were manageable, but he feared the Epoch-peak realm of the royal clans. If they appeared, it would be a devastating blow—no resistance possible, even with the array.

“Xuan Bingshou, hand over the boy. We may spare your lives!” Hun Xuefeng of the Hun Tian Clan spotted Luo Tian among them and addressed Xuan Bingshou.

“Indeed, they came for me!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He knew he had dragged them into this.

“Impossible! What are we to you? You give us anyone!” Xuan Bingshou replied firmly, his voice unyielding. Luo Tian felt warmth but also guilt.

“Then we have no choice but to kill all of you, erasing humans from the Origin Domain!” Tu Lekang sneered, his fangs glinting as he eyed them.

“Retreat!” Xuan Bingshou sensed the sea beasts had retreated into the array and commanded Luo Tian. He then flashed toward Seven Star Island.

“Pursue! None shall escape!” The three Epoch-Middle realm elders flashed toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Freezing Three Thousand Miles!” Xuan Bingshou, mid-flight, turned and exhaled a surge of cold air.

“Woo…” The extreme cold echoed across the world, time seemingly freezing.

“Crack…” A massive glacier formed under the intense cold. The world dimmed instantly.

Tu Lekang’s group halted, their subordinates frozen and falling from the sky. Some lost life instantly.

“Boom…” Bodies fell like dumplings, crashing onto the icy surface and shattering into fragments.

“Break!” Tu Lekang’s group extended their hands, sending three invisible waves outward. The scene returned to its original state—blood waves roared.

With Xuan Bingshou’s interruption, Luo Tian and the others successfully entered the array and reached the island.

“What now?” They quickly passed through the array, seeing the sea beasts and the massive void warship above.

“Board the ship!” Xuan Bingshou commanded the sea beasts, then gazed at Luo Tian.

“Go with them. Lead everyone to activate the ship and return to the Nine Realms!” Xuan Bingshou spoke again, their minds shaken.

“Also include Guan Xingjian and Hu Tianzong. All of you must leave!” Xuan Bingshou’s gaze was deep as he addressed the three island prodigies.

Xuan Bingshou’s words were clear—Luo Tian and the others must leave. They would stay behind, knowing their fate was certain. One Epoch-Middle realm elder, four Epoch-Middle realm cultivators, and several Epoch-Initial realm warriors could not withstand the three royal clans.

“Elder, we cannot leave!” Guan Xingjian’s eyes burned with battle spirit. He tightened his sword, gazing at the array.

“Smack!” Before Guan Xingjian could speak again, Xuan Bingshou slapped his face.

“This is not the time for heroics. Go!” Xuan Bingshou’s face darkened, scolding Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua who were eager to fight.

“We’ve lived long enough. We die, but you are our hope—irreplaceable!” Taiyang Jian’s face bore resolve as he addressed the three.

“Woo…” Luo Tian extended his hand, black and white qi swirling around his fingertips. He infused it into Guan Xingjian’s body.

“This is my doing. I’ll stay behind!” Luo Tian sighed softly, his gaze resolute.

“Go with them!” Xuan Bingshou glared at Luo Tian, his voice nearly roaring. The sound made Luo Tian’s ears ring.

“Elder, you still don’t understand me. No one can stop what I’ve decided!” Luo Tian shook his head, his gaze deep. He still had his final secret—though he wasn’t sure if it would work.

“Ah…” As they hesitated, cries of agony echoed. Their brows furrowed slightly.

“They’ve entered the array so quickly!” Xuan Bingshou’s face darkened, gazing at the distance.

Three Epoch-peak realm elders faced immense resistance. The terrifying killing intent even made them feel fear, forcing them to retreat immediately.

Yet thousands of troops were lost within the array. The three Epoch-Middle realm elders’ faces darkened.

“Seven Star Island has such a powerful array. Even I feel fear!” Hun Xuefeng’s face trembled, gazing at the endless array.

“I’ll try again!” Tu Lekang’s face darkened. He flew toward the massive array, his body wrapped in blood qi.

“Woo…” A wave of gray energy instantly transformed into blades, slicing at Tu Lekang’s blood qi.

“Ten zhang… Hundred zhang…” Tu Lekang had barely moved a hundred zhang before his blood qi shattered, torn apart by the overwhelming killing intent.

“Damn!” Tu Lekang’s face paled. He turned and fled from the array.

“Ah…” Instantly, waves of killing intent enveloped Tu Lekang. He writhed in pain, his body drenched in blood.

Yet Tu Lekang was an Epoch-Middle realm cultivator. In a blink, he escaped the array.

“Not working! Without the correct position, we can’t enter!” Tu Lekang panted, his gaze wary of the array’s power.

“We must unleash the Royal Weapons to break through! Though I hate to use them early, we can’t give them time. Unexpected events may occur!” Hun Xuefeng’s face darkened, his hand waving as gray light erupted from it.

“Only this,” Tu Lekang and Qi Hongyun murmured. Their hands moved, sending powerful waves from their three.

“Those of Epoch-Initial realm and above, follow us. Wait here!” They commanded their subordinates.

Chapter 1353: Powerful Return

“You still won’t leave!” Xuan Bingshou glared at Luo Tian and the others who refused to go.

“Elder Xuan, we can all leave! The array will hold for a while!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Xuan Bingshou.

“Indeed. We have no choice,” Xuan Bingshou sighed, his eyes filled with helplessness. He knew the three royal clans had many tricks and could enter at any moment.

“Go!” They flashed into streaks of light, landing on the warship. The ship was already crowded with over ten million people—sea beasts who had fled from the Seven Star Sea.

The crowd now knew the Ancient Multitudes were attacking them. Their hearts trembled.

“Elder!” As Xuan Bingshou and others landed on the ship, the chaotic crowd instantly found their anchor. They gazed at Luo Tian and Xuan Bingshou.

“Count on you!” Xuan Bingshou’s face bore deep concern, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Understood,” Luo Tian knew this was a critical moment. He stepped to the front of the ship, where a ten-zhang wide and long altar stood.

Luo Tian extended his hand. The black and white qi returned to him by Guan Xingjian flew from his fingertips, instantly entering a lamp-like object prepared by the Seven Star Island’s people.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian unleashed his Epoch Power. He closed his eyes and touched the lamp’s cover.

“Woo…” A resonant hum echoed within the lamp. Luo Tian’s consciousness infiltrated the black and white qi.

In an instant, his consciousness expanded infinitely. He searched through endless voids, seeking a connection.

While Luo Tian searched, in the Nine Realms’ Tianyuan Continent, on the massive Wuxing Mountain, a grand hall’s dark tortoise shell suddenly hummed.

“Someone is searching for me!” Yin Yu’s spirit sat within the tortoise shell, its eyes flickering with fire. Glowing light erupted from the skull’s eyes.

“Only Yang Yu and the original form of the Divine Beast Dao Map can connect with me,” Yin Yu’s eyes flickered.

“Yang Yu is impossible. That bastard is being hunted! So it must be the original form of the Divine Beast Dao Map. But the original form was sealed by my predecessor at the entrance to Lei Domain and Origin Domain!”

“This energy is faint. I wouldn’t sense it without careful attention. Who could it be?!” Yin Yu’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“Woo…” Yin Yu instantly unleashed black qi, sending invisible waves into the void toward that faint connection.

“Who are you?” Yin Yu sent a mental message, attempting to communicate with the faint energy.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian’s face lit up with excitement. His forehead was drenched in sweat, but his eyes glowed with joy. He spoke to Xuan Bingshou and others.

“Connected!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in their ears, causing them to rejoice instantly. Without waiting, they unleashed their Epoch Power.

“Open!” Their voices rose in unison. The massive warship emitted radiant light, roaring with power.

“Rip… Rip…” As the void ship activated, the pale blue sky was torn open. The vast ship plunged into the stars.

“What is this?” As the massive ship entered the stars, Tu Lekang and others held their ultimate Royal Weapons. They broke through the array to enter Seven Star Island, witnessing the void ship’s departure into space. Their eyes were stunned speechless.

“They’re escaping!” Hun Xuefeng realized, shouting in alarm.

“This ship is a treasure. It rivals the Royal Weapons!” Qi Hongyun’s eyes gleamed, gazing at the void ship now in space.

“Can’t escape!” The three instantly glared, their eyes flashing with coldness. They flashed forward, using their Royal Weapons to chase the void ship.

“Three Epoch Treasures!” Xuan Bingshou and others on the ship grimaced.

“Looks like we must fight,” Xuan Bingshou spoke solemnly, gazing at Luo Tian who piloted the void ship. He then sneered and leaped out of the ship.

“We’ll go too!” Yun Wuyi and Bai Ze’s faces changed, flying out to stand beside Xuan Bingshou.

“Seal it!” Qi Hongyun’s eyes flashed with coldness. He activated a black bell, channeling all his strength to strike the void ship.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed. The black bell emitted dark qi, its overwhelming aura suppressing the heavens and earth as if an Epoch Master had returned. Black runes spread across it, instantly sealing the stars.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed. He gazed at the black bell suppressing the stars.

“The Qilin Clan’s Royal Weapon, the Qilin Bell!” Luo Tian instantly recognized its origin. His face changed.

“Blood Clan’s Royal Weapon, the Crimson Lotus Lamp!”

“Hun Tian Clan’s Royal Weapon, the Heaven-Shattering Fan!” Luo Tian then identified Hun Xuefeng and Tu Lekang controlling the other two Royal Weapons. His eyes bore a bitter expression.

“Big move!” Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at the overwhelming Royal Weapons that could suppress everything. His eyes held a bitter smile.

“What now?” The islanders felt the despairing aura, their eyes filled with bitterness.

“Almost there. We were so close to returning to the Nine Realms!” Their hearts were filled with resentment, but they were now in an impossible situation. Three Royal Weapons controlled by three Epoch-Middle realm elders left no chance for survival.

“Fourth Deputy Leader, you control the void ship. You should be able to handle one Royal Weapon. I’ll take the other. The rest is up to you!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze heavy.

“You!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, everyone was stunned. Their eyes gazed at Luo Tian in disbelief.

“Luo Tian, don’t be reckless!” Xuan Bingshou’s voice carried urgency. They were truly in a desperate situation.

“Roar…” As the crowd felt despair, a low roar echoed across the蛮族 continent. Their brows furrowed slightly.

“Such a powerful aura!” They looked puzzled, then felt a cold blood qi in their perception.

Red light flickered. A crimson-clad figure appeared before them, his eyes blood-red, surrounded by blood qi.

“Is it him?”

“Shen Gong Feichi!” Luo Tian’s heart jolted. He recognized the crimson figure instantly.

Though Shen Gong Feichi now radiated powerful blood qi, his plump body and familiar appearance made it impossible for Luo Tian to mistake him.

“Feichi!” Shen Gong Fu’s face lit up with joy, but then turned bitter. He didn’t want Shen Gong Feichi to return at this moment.

“Epoch-Initial realm!” Luo Tian sensed Shen Gong Feichi’s aura. His eyes gleamed, but he felt something was off with Shen Gong Feichi’s state.

“Every clan should die!” Shen Gong Feichi turned, nodding to Luo Tian and Shen Gong Fu. A cruel smile spread across his lips as he gazed at the royal clan members.
