The people around were tense. When they saw two figures clad only in underpants beneath the turtle shell, their lips twitched.

"Who are these oddballs!" The crowd gazed at Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo, eyes filled with confusion. Then, upon seeing the turtle shell hovering above their heads, radiating an epochal aura, their eyes gleamed with intense greed.

"Ahh... who! Who! I've never suffered such a loss in my life. How could I, who's always been the one hunting geese, end up blinded by them? Who dared to strike me in the dark? I'll skin your flesh and dig up your ancestors' graves if I find out who it is!" Zhang Ke Nian howled, his heart bleeding.

Chapter 1073: The Aura of the Epoch

"Ahh..." Wails echoed through the starry void. The澎湃 (surging) black and white qi of the Divine and Demon Cave expelled two figures in complete disarray.

"Out?" Luotian's face bore a smile as he watched Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo, his eyes filled with interest.

At that moment, their forms were utterly disheveled. Their bare bodies bore countless cracks, constantly eroded by the black and white qi, emitting pig-like cries as if severely wounded. Only Luotian and his companions knew the reason for their agonized wails.

"God, I've worked so hard all my life. Finally, someone stripped me to my underpants! I must avenge this humiliation. I've roamed the Divine and Demon Domain for half my life, yet this is the first time I've suffered such a loss. If I don't repay this debt, I'll write my name upside down!" Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo roared through the starry void.

"Ah, truly remarkable individuals. Even the Divine and Demon Cave couldn't keep them!" Sun Feiwen transmitted mentally to Luotian and Sun Mengru.

"Ah," just as Sun Feiwen's words echoed in their minds, Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo turned their gaze toward the crowd, scanning it repeatedly.

"Cut off the transmission!" Luotian's face darkened upon seeing them surveying the crowd. He could sense they had definitely overheard Sun Feiwen's remarks.

Yet, with the crowd so vast and transmissions so chaotic, their hearing was muddled. They couldn't discern who had spoken, otherwise Luotian's group would have been exposed.

Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo listened to the surrounding murmurs, raising their turtle shells before them. They chanted seals, integrating them into the shell.

"嗡……" The turtle shell emitted a resonant hum. A soft white light erupted before them.

"轰隆隆……" As Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo activated the turtle shell, Luotian, Sun Mengru, and Sun Feiwen's faces abruptly changed.

Their eyes reflected disbelief, but it vanished instantly. Their minds, however, surged with waves of astonishment.

Because their perception revealed that the treasures looted from them within the storage rings seemed to be drawn toward the turtle shell, as if resisting their containment.

"Why do they still react? I've erased all restrictions!" Luotian's eyes showed confusion. He exchanged glances with Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen, finding the same anxious look in their eyes.

"Who are these two? They seem familiar," people murmured, gazing at Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo, nearly naked.

"Haha! They're still here! I'll see who dares touch my belongings! Prepare to dig up your ancestors' graves!" Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo spoke loudly, leaving people speechless.

"What bizarre methods of threatening! Digging up graves!" People murmured, watching the two as if they were clowns, activating their turtle shells.

Hearing the murmurs, Luotian's mind turned. He felt the treasures within his storage ring becoming increasingly uncontrollable. His voice echoed through the starry void, but in a different tone—hoarse.

"They are those tomb robbers, Zhang Ke Nian and the thief Si Ma Tuo!" Luotian's hoarse voice echoed through the starry void, ethereal and indistinct.

"What?"

"Zhang Ke Nian, that tomb robber?" People immediately scrutinized Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo.

"Yes, it's them! That's why they looked so familiar. Their method of threatening is also to dig up graves!" People erupted in chaos, their gazes turning hostile toward Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo.

"Si Ma Tuo isn't a good person either!" People glared, brandishing weapons. Glints of light flashed as they surrounded the two.

"Let's all attack and kill these bastards!" Sun Feiwen's eyes lit up, blending into the crowd. His voice changed slightly as he shouted, throwing a flying sword toward Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo.

"Bastards! So close!" Upon hearing Luotian's voice, Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo halted their turtle shell activation. Their faces darkened as they gazed at the crowd surrounding them.

They had clearly felt their treasures within the crowd. If given a little more time, they could retrieve those treasures. Yet the opponent had directly revealed their identities.

"Zhang Ke Nian, bastard! Come and get it!" A flying sword ignited the crowd like a fuse. Martial arts techniques erupted from people's hands, striking toward Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo.

"Everyone, listen to me. This... is a misunderstanding..." Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo tried to explain, but the frenzied crowd paid no heed.

"Damn!" Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo's eyes shifted. They chanted seals again, activating the turtle shell to shield themselves.

Explosions resounded. Luminous martial arts techniques pierced through the starry void, surrounding them and obscuring the crowd's view.

Luotian's group grimaced, watching Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo under attack. They sighed inwardly; these two had truly become the enemies of the Divine and Demon Domain.

"This one could even withstand a sage's peak!" Sun Feiwen sighed, gazing at the relentless storm of martial arts techniques that overturned the starry void.

After a full quarter-hour, the storm finally calmed. The next moment, everyone's faces bore shock as they gazed at Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo, who had been struck by the crowd's martial arts.

Within a soft glow, Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo bore expressions of trembling. They gazed at the crowd, their faces pale but bodies unscathed. They were leaping about in their underpants within the soft light.

"God, you're giving me face but not respecting it! You really think I'm a soft target!" Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo's moods were at their worst. Their treasures had all been taken, leaving them stripped to underpants. After emerging, they were attacked by a crowd—how could their moods be good?

"I've only robbed tombs all these years, never killed anyone. But today I'll break my rule and show you the fury!"

"It's time these people learned a lesson. Otherwise, they'll really think we're just common thieves!" Si Ma Tuo added in agreement. They exchanged glances, seeing fierce killing intent in each other's eyes and nodding slightly.

"Haha! A rat who only knows tomb robbing, a thief who only steals. Show me your moves!" People's eyes held mockery as they gazed at the turtle shell above them, their gazes filled with greed.

"Not ordinary. It can withstand so many people's attacks. Definitely not an ordinary item," people thought, their greed intensifying. They gathered martial arts again, striking toward Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo.

"Go to hell!" Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo shouted, spitting a mouthful of blood onto the ancient turtle shell above their heads.

At the same time, they chanted seals, sending them into the shell. The turtle shell emitted a series of soft white qi—seemingly gentle, yet carrying immense killing intent.

"Go!" When Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo attempted to activate the turtle shell for an attack, Luotian's heart tightened.

Others might not know, but he did. This turtle shell was an epochal treasure. Though Luotian suspected it wasn't a complete one, if fully activated, it was beyond their capacity to withstand.

Luotian didn't want to explain further. He grabbed Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen, vanishing into the starry void and fleeing toward the distance.

"Go!" Finally, under Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo's full activation, the turtle shell emitted white qi that filled the starry void. It transformed into a pure white whale, with the turtle shell becoming one of its eyes. The whale surged toward the crowd.

"Ah..." The white whale opened its mouth, swallowing the heavens and earth. It seemed to devour the sun, moon, stars, and rivers. A powerful suction emanated from its mouth, swallowing everyone into its belly.

"Let me refine you!" Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo's cold voices echoed through the starry void, causing those swallowed by the whale to change their gazes. They launched martial arts techniques.

But soon, people were stunned. Techniques that even a sage's peak would approach cautiously were launched into the whale's belly, yet they stirred no ripples.

"Buzz..." Next moment, white mist enveloped everyone. Cries echoed through the starry void.

The white mist carried extreme purification power, like a divine punishment. It invaded people's bodies, causing white smoke to rise from them. A sage in the middle stage was completely refined within an instant.

"Who dared to target my treasures? I'll make you pay! Hope the bastard who struck me is among them!" Zhang Ke Nian spoke coldly, gazing at those being refined.

Luotian, Sun Mengru, and Sun Feiwen stood in the distance of the starry void, watching the massive whale. Their faces bore shock.

"That's epochal power. That unassuming turtle shell is an epochal treasure!" Sun Feiwen exclaimed, watching the white whale rising smoke. His face bore intense fear.

Chapter 1074: The Ritual of the Demon Clan

Under the starry void, Luotian's group watched the white whale slowly dissipate. Their eyes bore shock. In just a quarter-hour, so many people had been completely refined and killed by Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo. The power of an epochal treasure was unimaginable.

Luotian gently caressed the black turtle shell in his hand, his eyes filled with anticipation. He thought about one day breaking the seals on the shell and simultaneously activating the ancient heavenly palace and the turtle shell. Who would be his match then?

"Epochal treasure, its power is so formidable. But how could two people at the middle stage of sage activate it?" Sun Feiwen questioned, watching the disappearing white whale.

"That's not a complete epochal treasure. It seems to be a part of it!" Sun Mengru explained.

"Ah, that's why! To activate an epochal treasure, one needs the peak of sage. How could two middle-stage sages do it?" Sun Feiwen sighed, his voice carrying a touch of envy.

In this era, such treasures were absolute无敌 (invincible). Unless one used fragments of other epochal treasures or a true epochal treasure, no one could match it. But where would one find such things?

Yet Sun Feiwen had no fear. After all, the divine clan's resources were vast. Even after the Divine and Demon Lord, there had been epochal lords who left epochal treasures for their descendants to guard. No one dared provoke them.

"I'm returning to the demon clan! The demon clan's ritual is about to begin. Will you go?" Luotian addressed Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen.

"The demon clan's ritual? We should go, right? It's a major event in the Divine and Demon Domain. I believe all major sects will attend. Be careful, since we've made enemies in the Divine and Demon Cave. They might cause trouble for you!" Sun Feiwen warned Luotian.

"Trouble? It's not certain who will cause it! I haven't settled the score with them in the Divine and Demon Cave. If there's any commotion at the demon clan's ritual, don't blame me for taking harsh measures!" Luotian's eyes flashed with killing intent.

The demon clan's leader must be Elder Nan Gong Bo. Only when Nan Gong Bo solidified his position as the demon clan's leader would Luotian feel at ease. All obstacles, Luotian would help Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing eliminate with all his might. After all, the demon clan was a backup plan for Luotian's strategy in the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Fire Domain. Currently, the Four Sacred Star Domains were still too weak.

After a brief exchange, Luotian watched Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen fly toward the divine clan's direction with reluctant eyes.

The Harmonious Sect had emerged. Sun Mengru hadn't yet explained to the divine clan, as the Harmonious Sect had been destroyed by them. Now that it had re-emerged, the first thing was to attack the divine clan's goddess. This could not be ignored.

Luotian smiled, transforming into a long rainbow and flying toward the demon clan's direction. He vanished into the starry void.

Outside the Divine and Demon Cave, Zhang Ke Nian and Si Ma Tuo stood pale-faced. They still wore underpants, gazing at the white mist dissipating beneath the epochal power. Nothing remained of those people.

"Damn, these people are so poor! Not even a pseudo-epochal treasure!" Zhang Ke Nian cursed, standing under the starry void.

"No pseudo-epochal treasures mean the one who attacked us isn't among these people. That's good. The only ones who could attack us are a few: Luotian, and those sects!"

"Yes, only a few. The demon clan's ritual is about to start. When they arrive, we'll sneak in. I want to see who dared to attack us. Also, I'll check the demon lord's tomb for some good treasures. Right now, we're truly broke!" They had been completely looted, their eyes almost green with envy. Their figures flickered as they found a place to rob two super-exceptional sect disciples, changing into clothes before flying toward the demon clan's mountain.

Luotian flew for seven days, arriving at the demon clan's mountain. He stood outside the mountain, his eyes filled with admiration.

Overall, Luotian's journey to the Divine and Demon Domain had been relatively smooth. Though dangerous, even nearly losing his life, the result was good. Both matters were almost completed. He had obtained the petals of the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower. Now, only when the demon clan's leader was fully seated by Elder Nan Gong Bo could Luotian return to the Four Sacred Star Domains to be with his family, then prepare for the Dragon Valley to obtain the Immortal Life Bamboo and refine the Reincarnation Pills.

At that moment, the demon clan's mountain was bustling with people. The major forces of the Divine and Demon Domain had arrived, being led into the mountain by demon clan disciples.

As Luotian stepped onto the mountain gate, two demon clan disciples blocked him: "Please state which sect or star domain you belong to!"

The two disciples' questions were simple, yet Luotian's brows furrowed slightly. Previously, he had killed the previous demon clan leader Nan Gong Liang in the demon clan. How could these disciples not recognize him?

"Luotian from the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Luotian furrowed his brows slightly, announcing his identity and waiting for them to let him pass.

But the two disciples exchanged glances, shaking their heads slightly: "Sorry. Please prove your identity and confirm that you are Luotian from the Four Sacred Star Domains. Our demon clan's ritual doesn't want anyone with ill intentions to disrupt it!"

Hearing the two disciples' words, Luotian let out a light laugh: "Prove I'm Luotian? Prove I am myself?"

Luotian extended his hand, pointing at his nose. He spoke to the two disciples, his voice carrying a touch of coldness. They clearly sought trouble, acting without reason.

"Seems Elder Nan Gong Bo's position as leader hasn't been solidified yet!" Luotian sighed inwardly. His gaze swept over the two disciples, realizing they were acting under someone's orders.

"Master of the如意 Sect, Lang Ruyi!" As Luotian was about to continue speaking, a middle-aged man strode confidently up the mountain gate, addressing the two guarding disciples.

"如意 Sect?" Luotian's brows lifted. He glanced at the sect master, nodding inwardly. A sage in the late stage of cultivation, yet his aura was nearly complete, approaching the peak of sage.

Behind Lang Ruyi were two elderly men with lazy eyes. These caught Luotian's attention. Upon careful observation, he sensed their cultivation was at the peak of sage.

"Sorry, even if you are from the Four Sacred Star Domains, you have no right to enter. Our demon clan didn't invite anyone from the Four Sacred Star Domains!" The two disciples smiled but spoke, their faces still smiling yet hearts drumming. After all, Luotian had killed three of their clan's leaders and a prince.

But under orders from above, they had no choice but to face him. Their hearts constantly prayed Luotian wouldn't anger.

"You are Luotian!" As the two disciples addressed Luotian, three cold glares instantly fell on him. They scanned him thoroughly as if to examine him completely.

"Master Lang, please!" The two disciples who had escorted Lang Ruyi smiled and didn't ask him to prove his identity. They addressed Lang Ruyi.

"Wait a moment before entering. I'll check that kid!" Lang Ruyi's eyes were cold, leading two peak sage-level masters toward Luotian.

"I am!" Luotian calmly met Lang Ruyi's gaze. Sparks of energy flared between them, the tension thickening.

"Who killed my sect's prince and elders?" Lang Ruyi spoke loudly, his voice carrying a questioning tone.

"You should know well. If you want to fight, I'm ready!" Luotian gazed deeply at the mountain's peak, showing no fear. He responded loudly.

Hearing Luotian's response, the surrounding people let out gasps of surprise. Their eyes bore shock as they gazed at Luotian.

"First time anyone has dared to challenge Master Lang of the如意 Sect openly!" People marveled at Luotian's audacity, daring to confront Lang Ruyi in front of so many people.

"Haha, thinking you have some fame, you look down on others? You lack manners. Today I'll teach you a lesson to know your place!" Lang Ruyi scolded, his hand like jade descending toward Luotian.

"Old bastard! What are you? You don't even deserve to teach me! You're not worthy!" Luotian responded loudly. His golden hand shot out, colliding with Lang Ruyi's.

Chapter 1075: The Arrival of the Demon Domain

At the mountain gate of the demon clan, a green and golden hand collided in the sky, emitting thunderous sounds. Luotian and Lang Ruyi both retreated.

Luotian took two steps back, while Lang Ruyi only one. Both exchanged surprised glances.

"Little wonder you're so arrogant. You do have some talent!" Lang Ruyi's gaze held respect as he looked at Luotian.

Luotian sighed inwardly about Lang Ruyi's strength. He faced a sage in the late stage without fear, but he had suffered a slight disadvantage in their brief clash. This elevated Lang Ruyi's status in Luotian's mind.

Yet, Luotian had no fear. He had already killed the demon clan's leader Nan Gong Liang, let alone Lang Ruyi. If given time, Luotian was confident he could defeat Lang Ruyi.

"You're not bad either. Indeed, you're much stronger than your useless prince!" Luotian smiled, his aura rising. A golden dragon coiled around him.

Luotian's words had barely finished when the two peak sage-level elders behind Lang Ruyi suddenly opened their eyes, gazing at Luotian. This made Luotian's body tremble, but his gaze remained mocking toward Lang Ruyi.

"Then you admit it? You killed my sect's prince?" One of the peak sage-level elders spoke, his voice cold. It felt like Luotian had fallen into nine hells, trembling involuntarily.

"What if I did?" Luotian remained fearless, meeting the elder's gaze. His body emitted a series of sounds.

Peak sage-level. Luotian knew he wasn't their match, couldn't resist them. But he was certain the two elders wouldn't attack him. After all, the demon clan had said that anyone who attacked Luotian would be against the demon clan. Here was the mountain's base, they couldn't kill him.

"Brave enough to admit it. You think we won't kill you?" The two elders seemed to read Luotian's thoughts, their faces sneering. Their overwhelming killing intent pressed toward Luotian.

"Luotian, you're in trouble, huh? Need help?" Just as Luotian was overwhelmed by the elders' killing intent, a playful voice echoed. This made Luotian's eyes light up with surprise.

"Boom...!" A thunderous sound echoed. A mighty dragon roared from the horizon, its thick limbs walking through the sky toward the mountain.

Its massive body obscured the heavens and earth. A suffocating atmosphere instantly spread through people's minds. Its fierce dragon horns glowed with cold light.

"A sage in the middle stage of a dragon? My god, I've seen a sage in the middle stage of a dragon!" People gasped at the terrifying dragon's appearance.

Dragons, low-tier races of the dragon clan. To reach a sage in the early stage is already exceptional. A sage in the middle stage, there are few such dragons across the nine domains.

In an instant, with the thunderous sound, the dragon's massive body arrived at the mountain gate.

"Who are these people on top? Who could subdue a sage in the middle stage of a dragon?" People's faces bore shock as they gazed at the three people standing on the dragon.

"Are they from the Four Sacred Star Domains? When did the Four Sacred Star Domains become so powerful!" People's minds were filled with confusion.

On top of the dragon, an elderly man stood slightly hunched. Yet his overwhelming aura made people dare not even breathe.

Standing on the elderly man's body were three young men. Their youthful faces amazed people, their qi surging. One wore a purple robe, another was tall like a black tower, and the third resembled a youth with deep eyes and dragon qi surrounding him.

The youth lightly patted the dragon's head. The sage in the middle stage of a dragon became docile, its massive eyes showing respect as it landed on the ground with a heavy sound.

"Luotian, long time no see!" The purple-robed youth smiled and jumped down from the dragon to Luotian, bumping shoulders with him.

"Big brother, elder!" The other two youths also jumped down from the dragon, their faces filled with joy as they stood before Luotian.

"Your strength has increased again!" Luotian smiled, gazing at the youthful boy before him. His eyes grew deep.

"Big brother, I'm Long Jie!" The youth seemed to sense Luotian's concern and spoke, his voice still childish.

"That's good!" Luotian laughed heartily. His voice carried excitement as he looked at Long Jie, who had greatly increased his strength.

"Greetings, elder!" After a warm exchange with the three youths, Luotian bowed to the elderly man descending from the dragon.

"Excellent. Despite being suppressed by heaven, you've still reached a sage in the middle stage. Your talent is extraordinary, and your opportunities are also great!" The elderly man smiled with satisfaction, his voice filled with unhidden praise.

"Fortune. I almost lost my life!" Luotian smiled bitterly, recalling how he had entered the middle stage of a sage.

"What's wrong? You're in trouble?" Cao Dezhu approached Luotian, gently pushing him. His gaze turned to Lang Ruyi.

"Just a small matter. Why did you come?" Luotian shook his head slightly. With Cao Yuanshan's support, no one dared to interfere with the如意 Sect three.

"Of course. Nan Gong Yuqing is about to become a prince. We had to come and support the scene, so they won't be looked down upon. Also, with the demon clan's new leader, such a big event must have other domains' people coming too!" Cao Dezhu replied.

Luotian nodded, not continuing the conversation. He turned his gaze to the three from the如意 Sect: "So you still want to teach me a lesson?"

"Dragon Domain, Cao Yuanshan!" The two peak sage-level masters saw Cao Yuanshan and their faces bore shock. Their gazes turned fearful.

"Dragon Domain! They are from the Dragon Domain! That's Cao Yuanshan, a half-epochal-level master! I didn't expect him to come personally!" People's faces bore shock, turning into reverence.

A half-epochal-level master. In the nine domains, what status is that? To come personally to the demon clan's ritual. If the demon clan knew, three peak sage-level masters would be unsettled.

"Are you from the Divine and Demon Domain's如意 Sect? Do you think my hand can't reach the Divine and Demon Domain, so I'll ignore your words?" Cao Yuanshan's eyes narrowed as he gazed at the two peak sage-level masters of the如意 Sect. His eyes flashed with danger, scanning them.

Strength. Cao Yuanshan remained as strong as ever. Being scanned by Cao Yuanshan's gaze, the two peak sage-level masters shivered involuntarily.

"Of course not! Of course not!" The two peak sage-level masters, who had ruled the Divine and Demon Domain, were like frightened sheep before Cao Yuanshan. They quickly spoke.

"If there's another time, the如意 Sect of the Divine and Demon Domain won't exist!" Cao Yuanshan sneered, standing still. His voice was cold.

"Yes! Yes! We promise there won't be another time!" The two peak sage-level masters smiled, like docile sheep. They quickly apologized.

"Today, for the demon clan's ritual, I'll give them face and not attack! Go away!" Cao Yuanshan waved his hand at the three from the如意 Sect, who were groveling.

Hearing Cao Yuanshan's words, they felt relieved. They ran into the demon clan's mountain and climbed toward it.

People looked at Cao Yuanshan with reverence, secretly marvelling at his strength. They also envied Luotian for having such a powerful backing.

"Still need me to prove my identity?" Luotian smiled, addressing the two demon clan disciples who had blocked him earlier. They were now lying on the ground, eyes filled with fear as they gazed at Luotian and Cao Yuanshan. These two were masters who could suppress peak sage-level masters, making them unable to speak. Compared to these two mountain guards, they were a million miles apart. One word from them could kill him. They couldn't help but curse the elder who had given them this task.

One Luotian made them feel like a plague. With Cao Yuanshan added, they felt as if talking to the阎王 (Yan Wang). They were on the edge of life and death.

"Ah?" Cao Dezhu smiled, gazing at the two mountain guards. His eyes gleamed with a hint of sharpness.

"It seems bringing my grandfather was the right choice. I guess Nan Gong Yuqing isn't having it easy in the demon clan either. Since we're supporting, let's make a big show!" Cao Dezhu spoke softly, gazing at the endless mountain peaks. He cleared his throat.

"Dragon Domain, Cao Yuanshan has come to attend the demon clan's ritual!" Cao Dezhu shouted toward the mountain peaks. His voice echoed into the sky, resounding throughout the demon clan's mountain.

As his loud voice faded, people on the entire mountain trembled. They hadn't expected anyone to dare speak so loudly in the demon clan's mountain.

"Dragon Domain, wait. They said Dragon Domain! Cao Yuanshan? A half-epochal-level master?" But after hearing Cao Yuanshan's name, the entire demon clan mountain was completely shaken.

"Quickly go and fetch the closed-cultivation demon lord!" The three peak sage-level elders of the demon clan, upon hearing Cao Dezhu's voice, their faces slightly changed. They ordered a disciple behind them. At the same time, their figures vanished from the spot.

The mountain glowed with light. A series of figures appeared at the demon clan's gate, almost all old men with white hair. Their cultivation was no less than a sage in the late stage, and more than ten had the aura of peak sage. All looked at Cao Yuanshan with respect.

"Apologies for not welcoming you properly, Master Cao!" Three peak sage-level elders bowed respectfully to Cao Yuanshan.

"Ah, your demon clan's hospitality is quite strange," Cao Yuanshan frowned, addressing the three.

"Forgive us. We don't know where we offended you. Please point it out, and I'll correct it!" The three peak sage-level masters lowered their postures.

Cao Yuanshan was from the same era as Longzu, and thus older than them. His strength was undeniable. No one found it inappropriate for them to do so.

"You have such cautious gatekeepers. It's amusing! Luotian was previously blocked by your demon clan and asked to prove he was Luotian. That's laughable!"

"You said we shouldn't let people with ill intentions in. But Luotian's relationship with my grandfather is known throughout the nine domains. Saying that also implies my grandfather has ill intentions?" Cao Dezhu's face bore mockery as he gazed at the three peak sage-level masters.

Hearing Cao Dezhu's words, the three peak sage-level elders' faces darkened. Their gazes swept over the two who had already fallen to the ground.

"Which lineage are you from?" The eldest of the three peak sage-level elders asked, his voice cold.

"Old... old master. We are from the lineage of the previous clan leader Nan Gong Liang!" The two gatekeepers answered honestly, their faces filled with fear. Their bodies trembled.

"Who is currently leading the Nan Gong Liang lineage? Come out!" The eldest peak sage-level elder's face darkened. He ordered the people behind him.

"Master, it's me!" A senior stepped out from the crowd. His voice was still calm but his eyes were fearful and regretful, having listened to those people's advice.

"Defaming the demon clan's name. You must die!" The peak sage-level elder didn't even ask for the senior's name before slapping him with a black demon hand.

"Boom..." Blood splattered. The senior was instantly annihilated by the peak sage-level elder's hand.

"Master Cao, do you find this acceptable?" The eldest peak sage-level elder spoke as if it were a trivial matter, addressing Cao Yuanshan.

Cao Yuanshan nodded slightly. After all, this was the demon clan's territory. The three peak sage-level masters had done so much for him, which was already giving them face. This visit's main purpose was to support Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing, showing the Dragon Domain's stance. They couldn't go too far.

Chapter 1076: Gathering of Masters

At the mountain gate of the demon clan, Luotian stood beside Cao Yuanshan and others. Around him were masters from various sects in the Divine and Demon Domain, all of whom had ruled their domains. Their faces bore reverence as they gazed at Cao Yuanshan, whose figure was slightly hunched.

"Master Cao's visit is most welcome. We apologize for our poor hospitality!" Three peak sage-level elders bowed respectfully to Cao Yuanshan.

"Ah, your demon clan's hospitality is quite strange," Cao Yuanshan frowned, addressing the three.

"Forgive us. We don't know where we offended you. Please point it out, and I'll correct it!" The three peak sage-level masters lowered their postures.

Cao Yuanshan was from the same era as Longzu, and thus older than them. His strength was undeniable. No one found it inappropriate for them to do so.

"You have such cautious gatekeepers. It's amusing! Luotian was previously blocked by your demon clan and asked to prove he was Luotian. That's laughable!"

"You said we shouldn't let people with ill intentions in. But Luotian's relationship with my grandfather is known throughout the nine domains. Saying that also implies my grandfather has ill intentions?" Cao Dezhu's face bore mockery as he gazed at the three peak sage-level masters.

Hearing Cao Dezhu's words, the three peak sage-level elders' faces darkened. Their gazes swept over the two who had already fallen to the ground.

"Who is currently leading the Nan Gong Liang lineage? Come out!" The eldest peak sage-level elder's face darkened. He ordered the people behind him.

"Master, it's me!" A senior stepped out from the crowd. His voice was still calm but his eyes were fearful and regretful, having listened to those people's advice.

"Defaming the demon clan's name. You must die!" The peak sage-level elder didn't even ask for the senior's name before slapping him with a black demon hand.

"Boom..." Blood splattered. The senior was instantly annihilated by the peak sage-level elder's hand.

"Master Cao, do you find this acceptable?" The eldest peak sage-level elder spoke as if it were a trivial matter, addressing Cao Yuanshan.

Cao Yuanshan nodded slightly. After all, this was the demon clan's territory. The three peak sage-level masters had done so much for him, which was already giving them face.
