“Old man, I’ve been fighting you for so long. If it weren’t for your Epoch Treasure, would I waste this much time with you?” Luo Tian thought coldly, his eyes filled with mockery as he gazed at Zhu Ge Jie.

Chapter 1394: The True Appearance ()

Zhu Ge Jie stared at Luo Tian, his teeth nearly grinding to dust. Yet seeing the pitiful state of Zhu Ge Huangchao, he could do nothing against the seven-colored flame. He waved his hand, sending a storage ring into Luo Tian’s grasp.

“Five sacred herbs!” Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness pierced through the ring, his eyes revealing a hint of joy before an expression of satisfaction spread across his face.

Luo Tian stowed the ring away, then waved his hand to absorb the seven-colored flame from Zhu Ge Huangchao.

As the flame vanished, Zhu Ge Huangchao’s screams ceased. His eyes burned with fury as he glared at Luo Tian.

“What kind of flame is this? Why won’t my arm regenerate?” Zhu Ge Huangchao stared at his bare arm, his desperate efforts yielding no growth.

“I don’t know either!” Luo Tian lightly shook his head. How could Xiao Qi’s flame be so simple? A flame that had cultivated a human form, surpassing celestial fire—this was one of Luo Tian’s secrets.

“Luo Tian, how can his arm be restored?” Zhu Ge Jie, seeing Luo Tian’s demeanor, thought he was about to demand more. He demanded sharply.

“I truly don’t know!” Luo Tian spoke again, this time speaking the truth.

“You…” Zhu Ge Jie’s face darkened. Seeing Luo Tian’s expression, he nearly lost control, about to activate the Chaos Bell to kill him.

“We’re leaving!” Zhu Ge Jie’s face was cold. He had no desire to linger here any longer; today’s humiliation was complete. The priority now was returning to the Chaos Domain to find a way to restore Zhu Ge Huangchao’s arm.

Jiang Nanxuan coldly waved his hand, sending Zhu Ge Huangchao and Zhu Ge Jie away. They possessed an Epoch Treasure; it was indeed difficult to detain them.

“Luo Tian!” As Zhu Ge Jie and Zhu Ge Huangchao departed, Yan Hongtao and Sun Miechen’s faces lit up with fierce battle intent. Their eyes flashed with sharp light, staring at Luo Tian.

“Two of you, do you think I’m in a state to continue fighting? Besides, I’m still in the Early Epoch. Are you happy with your victory?” Luo Tian chuckled lightly, his demeanor returning to normal as he addressed them.

“How are you still alive?” Yan Hongtao shouted, his voice filled with disbelief as he voiced the question in Sun Miechen’s mind.

“Survived a great disaster!” Luo Tian lightly shook his head, unwilling to elaborate with Yan Hongtao.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao fell silent. Though Luo Tian was still in the Early Epoch, he still filled them with immense pressure.

Zhu Ge Jie’s strength was evident to all; yet Luo Tian had nearly killed him in the Early Epoch. This revealed Luo Tian’s terrifying power. If he reached the Middle Epoch, they could almost see the Luo Tian who had once subdued them all.

“One step behind, and you’re forever behind. I won’t let him surpass me!” Sun Miechen thought to himself, his gaze turning toward Luo Tian.

“When I reach the Middle Epoch, I’ll restrain my strength and fight you!” Sun Miechen spoke softly. His battle spirit had been ignited by Luo Tian’s rebirth. For years, Sun Miechen’s greatest regret was losing to Luo Tian in the Divine Mountain battle. Now that Luo Tian had returned, it fulfilled his long-held wish.

“Your enemy isn’t me!” Luo Tian lightly shook his head, thinking of the prodigies within the Ancient Sovereign Clan and the offspring and disciples of Epoch Lords.

“The Ancient Sovereign Clan?”

“Those alien races sealed away by the Intercepting Heaven Lord in the Origin Domain?” Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed with disdain, clearly confident in his strength.

“Divine Race, still as arrogant as ever. Back then, one domain nearly destroyed the Nine Realms. Where were you when that happened?” Yan Hongtao sneered.

“Yan Hongtao, let’s fight!” Sun Miechen glared at Yan Hongtao, his cold snort echoing. The Shura Domain and the Divine Race had long been at odds, a feud that persisted into this generation.

“Fight then! I don’t fear you!” Yan Hongtao showed no hesitation, ready to fight at the slightest provocation.

“Two of you, if you must fight, do it elsewhere—don’t fight here in the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Luo Tian chuckled lightly, addressing them.

“Let’s go!” Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao exchanged glances before rushing out of the Ancient Heaven Palace. Their mission here had been accomplished, and knowing Luo Tian was alive was crucial for them.

“Brother Zhou!” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at Zhou Weilin. Seeing Zhou Weilin’s calm eyes, Luo Tian knew he had foreseen his return. He was awed by the terrifying power of the Starry Realm’s divination techniques.

“Congratulations on your rebirth. May the Starry Realm and Four Sacred Star Domains remain allies forever!” Zhou Weilin spoke softly, his voice tinged with sorrow.

“Friendship between me and Brother Zhou has always existed!” Luo Tian nodded lightly. Compared to Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao, he held no ill will toward Zhou Weilin.

“I must take my leave now. There are matters to prepare. If you have time, visit the Starry Realm; I’ve long invited you.” Zhou Weilin bowed to Luo Tian and others before vanishing from sight.

Watching Zhou Weilin’s departure, Jiang Nanxuan and others surrounded Luo Tian, their faces filled with confusion.

“If I hadn’t revealed myself, they would’ve targeted the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Luo Tian shook his head softly.

Though it seemed they had resolved the issue, this was within the Four Sacred Star Domains. For years, the domain had its own depth; Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao lacked confidence. Their purpose here was to test the Four Sacred Star Domains’ limits.

It seemed they had succeeded, not only testing the domain’s boundaries but also suspecting Luo Tian and exposing him.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the group fell silent. They weren’t fools; they understood his intent. Luo Tian’s appearance would inevitably draw the Nine Realms’ attention, and any hostility would target him.

Luo Tian’s pressure was immense; even in the Early Epoch, they would surely act against him. Former enemies would rise to threaten Luo Tian.

“Bitter! Let’s reveal our secret of the Seven Star Island and overturn a sacred domain. Who dares to target us now?” Zheng Xin and Gu Lei shouted loudly.

“It’s not yet the time!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. The Ancient Sovereign Clan remained a stone weighing on him.

Only by uniting the Nine Realms could they抗衡 against those Ancient Sovereign Clans, giving them a chance at survival. Luo Tian wasn’t doing this for the Nine Realms but to protect the Four Sacred Star Domains and his loved ones from perishing in this great era. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have endured so long; he would’ve activated the Void Warship to conquer relentlessly. With Xuan Bing’s Epoch-End strength and an Epoch Treasure, no sacred domain could withstand it.

“Enough. Let’s get back to work!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, addressing the group as they exited the Ancient Heaven Palace.

This was Luo Tian’s first time revealing his true face from the Ancient Heaven Palace, appearing on the Tianyuan Continent.

As Luo Tian and his group emerged, they caused a stir within the Five Elements Sect. After all, they were now pillars of the sect.

“Who is that?”
“He looks familiar. I think I’ve seen him before!” People respectfully gazed at the figures in the sky, then noticed Luo Tian, pale-faced and standing before them.

“That’s Luo Tian!” A senior elder’s eyes welled with tears, gazing at the man standing there. He was none other than Lu Kunpeng, the former Grand Elder of the Five Elements Sect’s Alchemy Hall and now its current Grand Master.

Time passed, Lu Kunpeng’s strength had increased slightly, but he was clearly surpassed by Luo Tian and his companions. He appeared even more aged.

“Luo Tian! Yes, it’s Luo Tian!” A clamor erupted. The Five Elements Sect’s disciples and elders wore wild expressions, as if igniting the entire sect. Their eyes held disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian in the sky.

“I’m back!” Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with emotion, gazing at the familiar faces on Five Elements Mountain. After so many years, he had finally reappeared in the sight of the Five Elements Sect’s people.

Figures darted forward, their eyes filled with excitement as they gazed at Luo Tian in the sky. Among them were elders from years past and disciples who had joined the sect alongside Luo Tian.

“I’m not dead!” Luo Tian spoke again, his voice trembling slightly, clearly moved.

“Not dead! Ha ha! Luo Tian isn’t dead!” People shouted, disbelievingly rubbing their eyes before laughing loudly. Their voices echoed throughout the Five Elements Sect.

The entire Five Elements Sect, even the Tianyuan Continent, was stirred into a frenzy by Luo Tian’s appearance. The crowd grew denser as Luo Tian—symbol of the Four Sacred Star Domains—reappeared. Though twenty years had passed, he was gradually forgotten by people. Yet with his return, the memories of his past resurfaced.

“Luo Tian has returned! I’ll see who dares to disrespect the Four Sacred Star Domains!” The people of the Tianyuan Continent roared, all bowing toward Five Elements Mountain.

“Yes! I saw Chaos Domain’s Lord Zhu Ge Jie and that Zhu Ge Huangchao fleeing from the Ancient Heaven Palace in a hurry. It must be Luo Tian who struck them down!” People gazed at the sky, discussing among themselves.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan vanished from sight, unable to stand there forever. Yet the Five Elements Sect was in an uproar, celebrating joyfully.

For three days, many elders of the Five Elements Sect came to visit Luo Tian. In those three days, the news of his rebirth spread across all star domains, shaking the entire Nine Realms.

Chapter 1395: Awakening ()

The news of Luo Tian’s rebirth spread like wildfire across the Nine Realms, igniting a storm. Everyone was stunned, unsure if it was true or false.

However, soon after, the news of Zhu Ge Jie being severely wounded in the Four Sacred Star Domains and returning to the Chaos Domain with his brother Zhu Ge Huangchao’s arm missing spread as well. This made people believe Luo Tian had truly returned, for they couldn’t imagine who else could have left Zhu Ge Jie in such a state.

The domain lords of the Divine Race, Beast Domain, and Shura Domain avoided commenting on this matter, further convincing people that Luo Tian had indeed returned.

“Returning so swiftly to strike down Zhu Ge Jie—unfailingly Luo Tian!” The Nine Realms buzzed with discussion, their gazes filled with respect toward the Four Sacred Star Domains. They knew Luo Tian’s return was a major event for the entire Nine Realms.

The once-invincible prodigy had now returned with a decisive victory over Zhu Ge Jie. People eagerly anticipated the scene of Luo Tian standing alone against numerous prodigies.

“Who will succeed in the Path to Enlightenment?” People wondered, greatly favoring Luo Tian. Many rose up, heading toward the Four Sacred Star Domains to meet this legendary prodigy who had vanished for twenty years, a hero of the Nine Realms.

The entire Nine Realms was in turmoil as people gathered more and more. A new rumor spread across the Nine Realms: that Luo Tian of the Four Sacred Star Domains was not the real Luo Tian but an alien race disguised to infiltrate the Nine Realms.

The mention of “Ancient Alien Race” made people recall the past disaster of the Demon Domain, a catastrophe still vivid in their memories.

“Luo Tian is dead! The Divine Race’s Elder Lord Sun Shengtian witnessed it. How could he still be alive?” Someone spoke, deepening the confusion of those heading toward the Four Sacred Star Domains.

This rumor swept through the Nine Realms like a storm, even as the Four Sacred Star Domains tried to suppress it. Yet they couldn’t contain it.

“Find out for yourself—whether it’s an Ancient Alien Race or not. If it is, we must destroy it. If not, paying homage to the hero is deserved!” People discussed, and all factions—big or small—rushed toward the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Damn it, who spread this rumor!” In the Tianyuan Continent of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi’s faces showed anger. They felt an invisible force pushing the Four Sacred Star Domains back into the spotlight.

“Who has such power!” The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains were also puzzled, even some local forces within the domain began to believe the rumor.

The Demon Domain had been destroyed, and the凤族 (Feng Clan) of the Beast Domain rebelled against it, seizing control. It was beginning to appear as a major sacred domain.

At this moment, in the Demon Domain’s Mourning King Palace, a young man sat cross-legged on a gray altar. A stream of gray flames floated around him, emitting an eerie atmosphere. The young man slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp with intelligence. A gray phoenix shadow flickered behind him.

“Indeed, he’s not dead. I’m still alive; how could you die? If you met me, you’d be surprised!” The young man waved his hand lightly and stood up. His figure vanished into the palace.

While everyone focused on the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian walked to the Broken God Cliff with reverence, standing before the Soul-Eating Beast.

“Elder!” Luo Tian didn’t waste words but sent several Early Epoch spiritual souls toward the Soul-Eating Beast.

“Thank you!” The Soul-Eating Beast opened its eyes, swallowing the Early Epoch spiritual souls. Its massive eyes glowed with light.

“Adding these to the ones you sent before, it should be enough!” The Soul-Eating Beast spoke softly, a hint of admiration in its voice.

“Enter, and I’ll provide the cultivation you need!” The Soul-Eating Beast sighed deeply, gazing at Zhong Li Tian’s flesh body as it addressed Luo Tian.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded, now desperately needing to enhance his strength. He stood there, allowing the gray mist to engulf him.

“Hum…” The humming echoed, waves of energy affecting Luo Tian’s body. In the next moment, Luo Tian was sucked into the Soul-Eating Beast’s mouth.

When Luo Tian regained his senses, he found himself in a gray space, his eyes filled with awe.

“Don’t panic. You’re now inside my body. When the Master of妙音 (Miaoyin) left, she created a small world within my body and sealed the young master inside!” The Soul-Eating Beast’s voice echoed in the gray space, startling Luo Tian.

“Epoch Lords—what kind of beings are they?” Luo Tian was awestruck, encountering one after another who were all terrifying.

The gray mist swirled in the gray space, then a platform rose from it. A youth with some resemblance to Zhong Li Tian sat cross-legged on the platform, his eyes closed and face calm, as if in deep sleep.

The youth’s body was adorned with glowing runes that danced across his form, emitting a tremor of power that startled Luo Tian.

“This is my two masters’ child, Zhong Zixuan!” The Soul-Eating Beast introduced to Luo Tian.

“Unseal!” The Soul-Eating Beast’s voice echoed, and a gray dragon roared out. This was the many spiritual souls Luo Tian had sent to it.

At this moment, these souls were devoid of will, completely refined by the Soul-Eating Beast. They seemed like soulless entities.

“Roar…” The gray dragon instantly lunged at the youth’s rune chains, transforming into a small Soul-Eating Beast that roamed around him, biting at the runes.

“Crack…” The runes gradually disintegrated as Luo Tian watched, their chains vanishing under the Soul-Eating Beast’s consumption.

What stunned Luo Tian was that as the rune chains disappeared, the youth’s aura gradually declined, his life force fading.

“This is why I urgently wanted to unseal the young master!” The Soul-Eating Beast’s voice echoed in the gray space.

“Although Master Miaoyin’s methods were excellent, time was too long. Life force and essence would eventually fade. If we continued to seal him, he might never awaken!” The Soul-Eating Beast’s voice echoed.

“Live a second life!” Before Luo Tian could react, the Soul-Eating Beast’s voice echoed again in the void. White light flashed within the gray mist, a powerful life force that made Luo Tian’s face change instantly.

“Immortal-Reviving Herb!” This life force was very familiar to Luo Tian. Such a powerful vitality could only be an Immortal-Reviving Herb.

“Rippling…”, the gray waves surged, and a white flower appeared in Luo Tian’s vision.

“Qiankun Nourishing Flower!” As the Immortal-Reviving Herb appeared, Luo Tian immediately recognized its origin—this was the herb held by Master Miaoyin’s phantom.

The white petals radiated intense vitality, descending onto the youth’s flesh body. Instantly, his life force revived.

A thunderous sound echoed within the youth’s body, and his blood and qi began to recover. His strength was formidable; even Luo Tian’s eyes showed caution.

Two golden lights flickered, and the youth slowly opened his eyes, a look of confusion followed by sorrow on his face.

“Have my seals been broken?” The youth spoke softly, sitting cross-legged on the platform before falling back into silence.

“Little master, now it’s up to you!” The Soul-Eating Beast sighed deeply as its voice echoed in the gray space.

“With my soul, with my blood, with my life, I break this eternal seal and sacrifice everything!” A low, reluctant voice echoed in the gray space.

Hearing the Soul-Eating Beast’s words, Luo Tian’s face suddenly turned pale. He clearly understood what “sacrifice” meant—this was the Soul-Eating Beast’s intention to erase itself, fully unsealing the youth!

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Before Luo Tian could react, a powerful Epoch force filled the entire space. A gray soul roared out—this was the Soul-Eating Beast.

The gray fangs carried endless coldness, continuously biting at Zhong Zixuan’s body. The rune chains kept breaking, and the Soul-Eating Beast’s mighty soul was gradually weakened.

“Hum…” Pure Epoch force also surged into Luo Tian’s perception, gathering toward the youth.

“This is the cultivation I’ve given you. It’s my entire life’s strength; you can fully absorb it, though you won’t be able to take all of it. The little master will need to recover his former peak state!” The Soul-Eating Beast’s voice grew weaker, its gray soul gradually fading.

“This…”, Luo Tian was utterly stunned, watching the Soul-Eating Beast destroy the last rune chain. A wave of infinite emotion surged within him.

“Hum…” As the final rune chain vanished, the youth on the platform emitted waves of energy. He began to absorb the pure Epoch force instinctively.

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, though he was reluctant, he still sat cross-legged and activated the Reincarnation Heaven Art to absorb the Soul-Eating Beast’s life force.

“Once I reach the Middle Epoch, I’ll stop!” Luo Tian resolved in his mind, not wanting to absorb too much.

Chapter 1396: Ascending to the Middle Epoch ()

In the gray space, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his face filled with reverence as he absorbed the surging Epoch force.

On the other side, Zhong Li Tian and Master Miaoyin’s son, Zhong Zixuan, also sat cross-legged on the platform, absorbing the Epoch force independently.

As both absorbed it, the space fell silent. Luo Tian had never felt so exhilarated—pure cultivation growth without any worries. His dantian’s three Reincarnation Immortal Bodies were furiously rotating, and the illusory immortal body was rapidly solidifying.

“Hmph?” The youth sitting on the platform frowned slightly, as if sensing Luo Tian’s presence. A killing intent surged from him, but due to some reason, he couldn’t rise from the platform. He could only let Luo Tian and himself compete.

“Hum…” Two massive whirlwinds spun above their heads, and both of their strengths rapidly increased.

Time passed slowly. After three days, Luo Tian finally opened his eyes, a look of joy on his face. His aura had undergone a complete transformation, and he smiled slightly.

“Finally reached the Middle Epoch!” Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with gratitude as he gazed at the gray space, sighing softly.

Luo Tian knew his ability to reach the Middle Epoch was entirely due to the Soul-Eating Beast’s sacrifice, providing him and Zhong Zixuan with its strength. Otherwise, even the Reincarnation Heaven Art wouldn’t have allowed him to reach the Middle Epoch so quickly.

“Unfortunately, the Soul-Eating Beast!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his eyes filled with admiration.

No need to guess—Luo Tian already knew the Soul-Eating Beast might no longer be alive. It had guarded the Broken God Cliff day and night, solely to awaken Zhong Zixuan. To ensure his awakening, it had sacrificed itself.

The Soul-Eating Beast’s formidable strength allowed Luo Tian to reach the Middle Epoch, but there was still much more flowing toward Zhong Zixuan.

“Unfailingly the son of Master Zhong Li Tian and Master Miaoyin!” Luo Tian marveled at Zhong Zixuan’s absorption speed, which was no less than his own Reincarnation Heaven Art.

“Hum…” The puppet that had once carried Zhong Li Tian appeared in the gray void, standing before Zhong Zixuan to guard him.

Luo Tian didn’t leave but stayed here to guard Zhong Zixuan, for the Soul-Eating Beast had done him a favor. Master Zhong Li Tian and Master Miaoyin had also indirectly helped Luo Tian, so he couldn’t let anything happen to Zhong Zixuan.

“Hahaha… that beast is finally dead!” As Luo Tian just steadied himself, a sinister laugh echoed through the void. The platform beneath Zhong Zixuan emitted black mist, and a withered old man materialized from the mist.

Seeing the old man’s appearance, Luo Tian instinctively shivered and his gaze turned serious, watching the black-cloaked old man with tension.

“Clank…”, the puppet’s lifeless eyes stared at the old man, sensing his hostility. Its lifeless gaze remained fixed on the black-cloaked elder.

“Epoch End!” Luo Tian’s mind jolted, instantly sensing the old man’s overwhelming pressure.

“Finally emerged! If that beast hadn’t died, I would’ve been the one to die!” The old man stretched his body, emitting a grating sound as if he hadn’t moved in ages.

“Zhong Li Tian! Master Miaoyin! You didn’t expect this, did you? I’ve survived until now!” The old man roared wildly, shaking the gray space with his voice.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, summoning the Heaven-Path Thunder Sword. From the old man’s words, Luo Tian knew he was likely an enemy of Zhong Li Tian and Master Miaoyin.

“You carry the aura I dislike—Reincarnation Body!” The old man gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with sinister intent. He licked his lips, looking terrifying.

“Too long has passed. Fortunately, Master Miaoyin sealed me here; otherwise, even I would’ve died back then!” The old man sighed, scanning the surroundings before spotting Zhong Zixuan on the platform.

“Zhong Li Tian and Master Miaoyin’s son!” The old man’s face lit up with joy, then turned sinister with hatred.

“Emerging to kill both of their children and obtaining an Immortal-Reviving Herb—my luck isn’t too bad. I can feel this world has no Epoch Lords; with the Immortal-Reviving Herb, I’ll extend my life. Perhaps I can even reach Epoch Lord status! Once I become an Epoch Lord, Master Miaoyin, you’ll beg for life and death!” The old man raged, then transformed into a black light, rushing toward Zhong Zixuan.

“Clank…”, as the old man moved, the Epoch End puppet’s eyes flashed red. Its body emitted a sound and rushed toward the old man.

“Boom…” The old man’s seemingly withered body repelled the puppet with a single punch, then continued toward Zhong Zixuan.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, summoning the Heaven-Path Thunder Sword. A thunderous sword surged toward the old man.

“Hmph?” The black-cloaked old man’s face turned cold, turning sharply and striking with a dry fist. His simple punch shattered Luo Tian’s sword light.

“Originally planned to wait, but since you’ve come seeking death, I’ll deal with you first!” The black-cloaked old man suddenly turned and rushed toward Luo Tian.

The puppet, seeing the old man didn’t attack Zhong Zixuan, mechanically returned to his side. Its eyes were vacant.

“Damn it, big brother! I’m helping you!” Luo Tian cursed as the puppet stood motionless before Zhong Zixuan.

In that moment, the black-cloaked old man reached Luo Tian’s side. His bony fist radiated powerful waves, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Get out!” Luo Tian had no time to think; the old man was strong, but he had just ascended to the Middle Epoch. He was confident in himself.

Golden light flashed across his body, and three Reincarnation Immortal Bodies erupted with power. Combined with Luo Tian’s formidable flesh body, he was confident he wouldn’t lose to an Epoch End opponent.

“Crack…” Thunder surged between their collision, lighting up the gray space. At the same time, both Luo Tian and the old man were sent flying backward.

“Strong!” Luo Tian was awestruck, his entire arm riddled with cracks as if it had lost sensation.

“Am I really old? A Middle Epoch Reincarnation Body can’t even defeat me! My strength has declined too much!” The old man sighed softly.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian asked again, his eyes flashing with divine light. The old man’s words indicated he was from the same era as Master Miaoyin and Zhong Li Tian. Being sealed here by them, he must have been a legendary figure of his time.

“Ding Yiyuan? Have you heard of him? Perhaps the Nine Realms have long forgotten me!” The old man sighed softly.

“Human Demon! Ding Yiyuan!” Luo Tian pondered for a moment before his face suddenly changed, recalling a terrifying figure in human history.

“Human Demon Ding Yiyuan! He lost the competition for Epoch Lord status to Master Miaoyin, was bloodthirsty, and was called the Human Demon. He had the strength of a near-Epoch Lord and once slaughtered an entire sacred domain without an Epoch Treasure!” Luo Tian’s mind roared with memories of Ding Yiyuan.

“Haha, I didn’t expect anyone to remember me!” Ding Yiyuan chuckled softly before glaring at Luo Tian with a sinister expression.

“You’re also a Reincarnation Body, just like Zhong Li Tian. You all should die!” Ding Yiyuan moved swiftly toward Luo Tian again.

“Your strength has declined so much, your blood isn’t strong—still want to kill me!” Seeing Ding Yiyuan rushing toward him, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He unleashed the Great Dao Sealing Fist without hesitation, charging toward Ding Yiyuan with no fear.

“Who gave you the courage?” Ding Yiyuan’s face twisted with sinister intent, his body engulfed in black mist. Combined with his withered appearance, he looked like a devil as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

They clashed repeatedly in the gray void. Luo Tian’s blood and qi were strong, aided by two powerful techniques; he was no match for Ding Yiyuan’s weakened blood and qi.

The thunderous collisions continued, and Ding Yiyuan felt a growing sense of urgency. His blood was already weak; fighting Luo Tian drained not only his strength but also his remaining lifespan. If he continued, he might be exhausted to death by Luo Tian.

“Demon Flame Burning the Heavens!” Ding Yiyuan moved swiftly, retreating and releasing black mist from his body. It instantly enveloped Luo Tian.

“Burn!” Ding Yiyuan roared, his hands forming a seal to ignite the black mist. The terrifying temperature instantly enveloped Luo Tian.

“This heat!” Luo Tian’s body immediately emitted a scent of burning, his face showing a look of caution.

“This is my strength transformed into fire! I used this to destroy a sacred domain back then. You can’t withstand it!” Ding Yiyuan’s eyes were sinister, proud of his technique.

“This heat is comparable to celestial fire!” Luo Tian sighed softly. Under the terrifying temperature, his blood began to steam, sweat trickling down his forehead.

Luo Tian continuously punched, using his supreme flesh body to withstand the terrifying fire. However, the overwhelming flames showed no signs of being extinguished; instead, they grew more violent as Luo Tian channeled his strength.

“Don’t resist! My strength isn’t even a tenth of what it was before, but your little brat can’t withstand it!” Ding Yiyuan watched Luo Tian frantically punching the flames, his eyes filled with contempt.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian struggled, a seven-colored mark on his forehead glowed and began to pulse.

Chapter 1397: Xiao Qi’s Evolution ()

“Xiao Qi?” Luo Tian’s mind stirred, and a smile appeared on his face. He formed a seal with his hands, and the seven-colored flame emerged from his forehead, transforming into Xiao Qi’s form.

Though years had passed, Xiao Qi still showed no signs of growing up—still the size of a seven or eight-year-old, plump and white.

“Ah…” As Xiao Qi appeared, he drooled, showing no fear toward the flames that even Luo Tian found challenging. His bright eyes revealed a greedy look instead.

“You want it?” Luo Tian noticed Xiao Qi’s desire and spoke softly, creating a barrier to protect them both.

“Mm!” Xiao Qi nodded vigorously, jumping around Luo Tian’s side, as if trying to break through the barrier to devour the black flames.

Hearing Xiao Qi’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with divine light. He then sneered inwardly: “Old man, this time you’ve really met your match!”

“Sss…” Luo Tian waved his hand, creating a gap in the white barrier. The black flames rushed in through the opening.

“Eat!” Luo Tian told Xiao Qi, then reinforced the white barrier.

“Seal Soul!” Luo Tian coldly muttered, his massive spiritual force instantly covering the barrier. Even Ding Yiyuan’s formidable spiritual strength couldn’t penetrate it.

“Such a powerful spiritual force! This genius will surely become the second Zhong Li Tian!” Ding Yiyuan sneered, his strength surging again as he transformed into black flames.

“Ah…” Xiao Qi roared, his seven small braids rising and transforming into seven-colored flames. He stood at the barrier’s gap, greedily absorbing the terrifying black flames.

“Hmph?” After Xiao Qi began to absorb the flames, Ding Yiyuan felt a slight weakening of his black flames. However, he didn’t think much of it, confident in his techniques and believing Luo Tian was merely delaying with tricks. He couldn’t last long anyway, as his flames had once destroyed a sacred domain.

“I’ll see how long you can endure!” Ding Yiyuan’s eyes flashed with coldness, continuously strengthening the black flames.

Inside the barrier, Luo Tian watched Xiao Qi’s mouth constantly absorbing the black flames. His small body emitted a gulping sound, as if he hadn’t eaten in ages. Luo Tian felt a shiver; he couldn’t imagine how such a small body could swallow so much fire.

“This is terrifying!” Luo Tian’s mind trembled, but he didn’t stop it. He knew this might be Xiao Qi’s opportunity; after all, he hadn’t grown for over a decade.

“One hour… two hours…” Time passed slowly. Ding Yiyuan gradually felt something was wrong, but he couldn’t figure out how Luo Tian could withstand so much fire.

“Reincarnation Body is indeed powerful!” Ding Yiyuan’s eyes flashed with cruelty, spitting out blood to fuel the flames. The fire became even more terrifying, shaking the entire gray space.

“Crack…” The white barrier gradually struggled to hold, and sweat began to trickle down Luo Tian’s face.

“It should be enough by now!” Luo Tian muttered softly, sensing Xiao Qi’s body had slightly grown.

“Old man, you’re already weakened by your blood and qi. You’ve spent too much strength; I’m sure you’re at your limit!” Luo Tian muttered softly, his eyes filled with a hint of joy. He didn’t stop the barrier from breaking.
