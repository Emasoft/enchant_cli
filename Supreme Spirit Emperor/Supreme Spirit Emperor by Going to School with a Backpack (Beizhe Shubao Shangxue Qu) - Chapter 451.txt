“From ancient times to the present, how many ancient kings and epoch masters have successfully entered the Heavenly Realm? I do not know for certain, but I am certain that many perished upon the Immortal Path!” The Demon Lord sighed softly, having barely managed to reincarnate onto the Tianyuan Continent.

“Never mind, I shall go alone!” Luotian chuckled lightly, his gaze sweeping over the assembly, eyes filled with regret.

“If one day my strength is sufficient, I shall return!” Luotian spoke softly, his gaze lingering on family and friends. He knew this parting might be eternal; even the Immortal Kings could not interfere with the affairs of the Three Thousand Minor Worlds.

“Master, do you know how one might return to the Three Thousand Minor Worlds?” Luotian then turned his gaze toward Zhang Daotian.

“I do not know. However, I once heard my master, the Fallen Immortal King, say that beyond the Immortal King's realm lies another level of cultivation. He never reached it, but he claimed that those who truly ascend beyond the Immortal King's realm might touch that forbidden existence, defying rules and returning to the Three Thousand Minor Worlds.” Zhang Daotian sighed softly. To them, even the Immortal Kings were unattainable peaks; the realms beyond were unfathomable.

“Alas…” Hearing Zhang Daotian’s words, Luotian let out a long sigh. After all, he was merely at the Tian Dao realm—unparalleled within the Nine Domains but utterly ordinary in the Heavenly Realm.

“Regardless, I must enter the Heavenly Realm!” Zhang Daotian’s face darkened with hatred, his voice resolute.

“I shall go as well!” Gutianshu laughed, eyes ablaze with battle fervor.

“I will definitely go. Where one falls, one must conquer!” The Demon Lord spoke coldly; his past failure had left him deeply unsettled.

“I shall go too…” Yaochen’s eyes gleamed with gold, for the Nine Domains no longer satisfied him.

“I shall go too… I shall go too…” The hall erupted in a cacophony of voices, all vying to accompany Luotian on the Immortal Path.

“Enough, everyone. Let us not quarrel,” Luotian shook his head gently before continuing: “This matter requires careful deliberation. If we all enter the Immortal Path, what of the Nine Domains? Not everyone can go, and not all wish to. Correct?” Luotian chuckled, scanning the faces of those around him—familiar with their natures.

Take Zheng Xin, for instance. A cowardly wretch; if it were him, he would never dare risk the Immortal Path.

“There is still time. I believe not only us but also the Ancient Clans must send representatives! At least, to maintain a fleeting balance within the Nine Domains…” Luotian sighed deeply, voicing his concerns.

If they all perished on the Immortal Path, what then of humanity? Though currently coexisting with myriad races, without great masters to guard the human race, chaos would inevitably arise.

“Spread the word: I shall open the Immortal Path five hundred years hence. All who seek to enter it and chase immortality are welcome!” Luotian smiled, five hundred years being trivial for their current lifespans.

“During this time, let us deliberate who shall accompany me!” Luotian did not wait for objections before finalizing the plan.

“Damn, five hundred years remain. Make the most of it—let us feast and revel!” Gulei bellowed, his tone carefree.

“Stay put at home!” But as Gulei shouted, Luotian smacked him down. Gu Yun had already lost a daughter; Luotian would not let Gulei vanish as well.

“Hah, kid, stay put in the Nine Domains. After all, you are the sole heir!” The crowd laughed.

“Enough, everyone. It has been a long time since we met—let us gather!” Luotian chuckled, five hundred years enough to prepare.

“Let’s go…” Hearing Luotian’s words, the crowd shifted their focus, laughing and chatting as they led Luotian out.

Yet as Luotian reunited with his companions, news of his return to the Four Sacred Star Domains spread across the Nine Domains. Instantly, people’s attention turned to the Four Sacred Star Domains—after all, Luotian had vanished for a millennium.

“Behold! I, Luotian, shall open the Immortal Path five hundred years hence. All who seek to enter it and chase immortality may come to the Endless God Cliff!” As people marveled at Luotian’s return, a resounding voice echoed across the Tianyuan Continent, sending the Nine Domains into uproar.

Chapter 1754: Opening the Immortal Path

The resounding voice spread across the Nine Domains, causing an immediate uproar. Eyes wide with disbelief, people soon turned fervent.

“Immortal Path! Immortality!” All gazed hungrily toward the Four Sacred Star Domains. Who would have thought Luotian’s return would spark such a commotion?

“Do we truly have a chance at immortality?” All murmured, eyes alight with excitement.

“Please consider carefully. The Immortal Path is perilous; without strength, one cannot even survive,” Luotian’s subsequent words felt like a bucket of cold water, instantly cooling the fervor.

“Indeed! Even the Reincarnation Lord lacks certainty. How could we possibly succeed?” All sighed, their enthusiasm waning significantly.

Yet despite the majority’s cooling interest, some remained intrigued—such as those contemporaries of Luotian.

“In the Nine Domains I could not defeat you. If I enter the Heavenly Realm, perhaps I shall surpass you!” Jinziyang of the Crimson Phoenix Clan, now its leader, bore a determined expression.

“With my fortune, I may achieve great things in the Heavenly Realm!” Tu Feiyang of the Blood Clan, also a leader, gleamed with ambition.

“Chase the Immortal Path! Here I had no chance. I must chase my father’s footsteps!” Numerous epoch masters and royal heirs roared, reappearing in the public eye.

Yet they only appeared once; Luotian had set the Immortal Path’s opening five hundred years hence. Though five hundred years was not long for them, it was still considerable.

During this time, Luotian had left the Four Sacred Star Domains only a few times. No one knew where he went, but upon his return, he seemed weary—leaving people puzzled. After all, Luotian now dominated all existences; to see him in such a state suggested something grave.

“Luotian, what have you been up to lately?” At the banquet table, Zheng Xin and others inquired.

“Don’t worry so much!” Luotian shook his head lightly, a smile on his face: “Have you decided whether to go or not?”

“We shall all go!” As Luotian’s words fell, they all spoke up, declaring their willingness to accompany him on the Immortal Path.

“Your Star River Seals may allow entry into the Immortal Path, but its dangers are beyond my control!” Luotian sighed deeply. He had already decided to let only those with Star River Seals accompany him—voluntarily, and some must remain in the Four Sacred Star Domains, like Gulei and Zheng Xin.

“Enough. Let us not interfere with my affairs. For the next while, let us gather joyfully!” Luotian addressed them, his tone light.

“Sure thing…” Hearing Luotian’s words, the crowd erupted into noise again. Life returned to its warm and tranquil state.

Time flowed slowly. Five hundred years, long for commoners but a blink for Luotian and his companions. Through these years of reflection, Luotian had truly understood the value of time.

At dawn, Luotian slowly opened his eyes, gazing at his four wives with a smile: “It’s time to go!”

Luotian rose slowly, radiating an overwhelming aura that stirred the tranquil Nine Domains.

“Today?” Zheng Xin’s face bore a hint of sorrow as he rose, gazing toward Luotian’s residence.

“Wum…” A surge of overwhelming energy rose from the Tianyuan Continent, heading toward the Four Sacred Star Domains’ Endless God Cliff.

“Finally, after so long!” At the same time, the Nine Domains trembled. Others from the Ancient Clans who wished to enter the Immortal Path rose from their dwellings, heading toward the Endless God Cliff.

On the summit of the Endless God Cliff—where human and barbarian clans once waged war—Luotian smiled, his four wives’ faces soft with affection. He had already discussed with them to face the Immortal Path together.

Additionally, those without family in the Tianyuan Continent stood before Luotian. These were individuals who had been deliberated upon over the years, accompanying him on the Immortal Path—such as Sun Kelnian, Diaodezhu, and Long Jie.

Figures flickered; countless figures with soaring auras appeared on the Endless God Cliff, eyes burning with fervor toward Luotian.

“Reluctant to leave…” Duhongxi and others sighed, having lived in the Nine Domains for fifteen hundred years. They found it hard to part with their home, knowing that in the Heavenly Realm, even a thousand five hundred years might not see an immortal realm powerhouse survive.

Yet Duhongxi and others knew they would eventually have to leave. Having lived so long in the Nine Domains, they had gained much—be it Luotian fulfilling his promise to gift them the Zixiao Divine Lotus or their strength solidifying. They felt that with time in the Heavenly Realm, they could reach the Tian Dao realm.

The Heavenly Realm differed from the Nine Domains. Reaching the Tian Dao realm was not as arduous here; once one’s strength was sufficient and they endured the immortal trials, they could ascend.

“Hail to the Reincarnation Lord!” All bowed respectfully toward Luotian, even those who had once been his rivals or enemies. After all, Luotian’s strength had become the pinnacle of the Nine Domains—worthy of their reverence. Not that they submitted to Luotian, but rather to the power of an epoch master.

“Are all prepared? Once we depart, there may be no return!” Luotian scanned the crowd before reminding them again.

“Luotian, when did you become so hesitant? I’ve considered this for five hundred years! I was long decided!” Banyun laughed, his tone light.

“Yes, Luotian, I shall surpass you in the Heavenly Realm!” Tu Feiyang and many other royal heirs spoke loudly, eyes ablaze with battle spirit.

“Hah! Enough. I await you all in the Heavenly Realm. I hope, if we truly enter it, we may assist each other! After all, we are all from the Nine Domains!” Luotian laughed heartily before acting without delay. He extended his hand, and a surge of divine laws erupted from it.

“Wum…” Divine laws flew forth from Luotian’s hands, golden light flashing to illuminate the sky.

“Come out!” Luotian roared, his hands clutching two storage rings. He crushed them with a single motion—these rings had been gifts from Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao, containing two fragments of the Epoch Scripture.

The Golden Scripture shook the heavens. Upon the emergence of the two golden pages, the sky trembled with fear and dread, leaving people awestruck.

“This is the Epoch Scripture!” The clan leaders’ faces showed shock as they recognized it—the very scripture once possessed by kings.

“Boom… boom…” The golden consciousness surged, and upon the emergence of the two fragments, Luotian’s vast golden consciousness trembled. The Epoch Scripture floating above it also emitted thunderous roars.

The Golden Scripture slowly ascended from Luotian’s head, radiating an overwhelming aura. The golden pages flipped continuously.

The two fragments glided toward the Golden Scripture, merging into it.

“What wondrous artifact! I feel a fear—fear from the Dao itself!” Duhongxi and others gaped, awestruck by the golden book that could subdue heaven.

“Immortal Path! Open!” Under people’s expectant gazes, Luotian roared. The Reincarnation Bridge thundered, and a torrent of divine energy surged from it, injected into the Epoch Scripture.

Divine power swept across, golden light rising to the heavens. A gray vortex appeared in the sky, golden light flowing into it like a passage.

Hues of radiance enveloped the Endless God Cliff, and standing within the golden passage, Luotian and others seemed like descending deities.

“Those who seek to enter the Immortal Path, go!” Luotian sighed deeply, gazing once more at the Four Sacred Star Domains with a bittersweet expression. A sense of longing stirred within him.

“Grandfather, father, mother! I am unworthy; I cannot serve you!” Luotian knelt in the golden light with Jiang Sisi and others, gazing into the void.

“Go, Nine Domains!” Others also bore sorrowful expressions, gazing toward the Nine Domains.

“I, Luotian, today shall enter the Immortal Path and achieve immortality!” Luotian spoke loudly. His voice echoed as he led Jiang Sisi, four others, and many friends into the seemingly endless passage.

“Hah! Gulei, Xu Liyi, stay in the Nine Domains. When I reign over the Heavenly Realm, I shall return to fetch you!” Diaodezhu laughed.

“Immortal King’s Tomb, I am coming!” Sun Kelnian’s lewd voice echoed, causing the crowd to chuckle.

“Damn it, you’re not serious. Take care!” Gulei and others had tears in their eyes as they shouted toward Luotian’s group.

The golden book slowly closed, its light fading. Luotian and others gradually vanished from people’s sight.

“Hope all goes well,” Luo Xiong sighed, gazing at the golden book as it vanished into the void.

“Even if he is alone, he won’t be lonely!” Luo Nantian sighed, his face aged. His once jet-black hair bore a few strands of white.

Chapter 1755: On the Immortal Path

The golden passage, Luotian marched ahead with battle spirit in his eyes. Behind him, countless figures soared skyward, their faces alight with excitement—unaware they had vanished from the Nine Domains’ sight.

Their speed was swift, yet the golden passage seemed endless. After flying for half a day, they still saw no end.

“Will we be trapped here?” Diaodezhu looked puzzled. If this continued indefinitely, even they would exhaust themselves.

“No,” Luotian’s face bore determination. After some time of flying, he felt a growing sense—like being summoned. If he followed this passage, he would surely reach its end and ascend to the Heavenly Realm.

“Wum…” As they questioned, waves of energy emerged within their perception. A golden light flickered in the passage—unassuming yet bearing immense pressure, approaching Luotian’s group.

The golden light moved swiftly. Though it pressed upon Luotian, it was nothing to him.

In an instant, the golden light reached their vicinity. They glimpsed what it was—a skull head.

“Skull!” Diaodezhu gasped. Though just a skull, it made them tense.

“Come here!” Luotian extended his hand. A golden hand materialized, grabbing the golden skull.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed as Luotian took a few steps back, clutching the skull.

“This skull radiates the aura of a Tian Dao realm powerhouse!” They immediately felt the powerful fluctuations—identical to an epoch master’s aura.

“Correct. Be cautious; if danger arises, I may not be able to protect you all,” Luotian’s eyes darkened. He tossed the skull aside, having discovered an epoch master’s remains—this was no good news.

Though Luotian said this, their speed did not slow. They flew toward the passage’s end without hesitation.

Time flowed slowly. An invisible pressure descended upon them, slowing their pace. Luotian halted, his expression grave.

“It’s the Heavenly Realm’s power. Be careful!” Though this pressure was nothing to Luotian, it troubled others.

“Go!” Luotian took a step forward. This time, his pace slowed significantly, no longer reckless.

Luotian was cautious; others dared not rush. They followed him slowly forward.

“Wum…” As they took a step, waves of energy enveloped them—like scrutiny. A terrifying repulsion force pushed everyone except Luotian outward.

The overwhelming repulsion left no chance for resistance. Their faces darkened.

“Try to protect your bodies with divine energy!” The Demon Lord shouted, his staff radiating light. Nine golden dragons emerged from the staff, circling around him.

Hearing the Demon Lord’s words, others also acted. Gutianshu pointed his finger, divine energy seals covering his body.

Zhang Daotian summoned the Tian Dao Thunder Sword. Thunder surged before him, and the repulsion force vanished.

“Ah…” Some could not withstand this repulsion. The Crimson Phoenix Clan’s other princes, except Jinziyang, roared as their royal-level auras flared. Yet they were still pushed out of the golden passage.

“Second brother, third brother…” Jinziyang’s body surrounded by immortal fire watched his brothers pushed away. Who knew what awaited them?

Not only the Crimson Phoenix Clan’s warriors were expelled, but others from different factions as well. In an instant, they vanished from sight. No one attempted to pull them back—despite the desire, their reaction was too slow. Moreover, they felt that if they acted, they would be seen as provoking and also expelled.

“Go…” Dongbo Xin’s long hair flew, his body radiating supreme authority. He punched repeatedly, black and white energy surging.

“Another one who has cultivated divine energy!” Duhongxi and others gaped at Dongbo Xin’s overwhelming aura. Though he still used black and white energy, they felt an immense divine power beyond ordinary divine energy.

“This world is no simple one. In so few years, those who have cultivated divine energy are rare in the Heavenly Realm. This world has produced two such individuals!” Duhongxi and others marveled, sensing the Nine Domains’ growing mystery.

Among them, those who felt at ease were those who had obtained the Star River Seals. Golden light flickered on their waist tokens, and they felt only a slight pressure—no hindrance.

“Wum…” As they entered the repulsion zone, waves of sound echoed. The Golden Scripture flew from the golden passage and merged with Luotian’s golden consciousness.

“This is the true Immortal Path. The Golden Scripture guided us correctly, while those without qualification were excluded!” The Demon Lord spoke softly.

“Now comes the real test. As those who ascended to the Heavenly Realm said, the Immortal Path is not only blocked by the Dao but also by others from the Three Thousand Minor Worlds, vying for divine fortune—cruel beyond measure!” Duhongxi spoke softly, making Luotian’s heart tighten.

“Who are these others from the Three Thousand Minor Worlds?” Luotian asked, his gaze grave.

“I do not know. But they said they encountered opponents in a chaotic space and eventually ascended to the Heavenly Realm,” Duhongxi replied.

“Some, with good luck, met opponents weaker than themselves. Even some near-Tian Dao realm masters succeeded in ascending!” Duhongxi and others bore fear.

“Then, if we are lucky, perhaps we may ascend. But what of bad luck?” Diaodezhu asked, though he already guessed the answer.

“I do not know. Perhaps they died; no one knows where failure leads!” Duhongxi shook his head.

“Perhaps they truly perished, like I did!” The Demon Lord sighed, longing to know what he had encountered and why he reincarnated onto the Tianyuan Continent.

Luotian’s brows furrowed upon hearing Duhongxi’s words. He felt regret for bringing so many people. For years, Luotian had never before regretted a decision—these people were strong in the Nine Domains, but against Tian Dao realm masters, they would be crushed.

“Now that we’ve come this far, there’s no regret. From the moment we decided, we never expected to return!” Zhang Daotian smiled, seeing Luotian’s regret and comforting him.

“Yes, we chose this freely. It has nothing to do with you!” Others also spoke, gazing at Luotian.

“Remember to find us!” Jiang Sisi whispered, her gaze resolute. Her meaning was clear.

“Go!” Luotian sighed deeply before taking another step forward into the golden passage’s depths.

Others nodded, following Luotian deeper. Time flowed slowly; they had walked for a day, seeing only a few broken bones and no other incidents.

“Wum…” But as they relaxed, waves of energy again pressed upon their bodies, causing them to pause slightly.

“Did you notice?” Luotian’s face bore gravity as he addressed them. He felt his physical functions declining.

“Previously, we felt nothing but a slight discomfort. However, the more we walk, the more our divine energy depletes. Though I do not know why, now I can clearly feel my lifespan shortening!” Luotian spoke gravely.

“It’s the rules. I recognize this power,” Zhang Daotian sighed softly.

“So, the Dao’s trial is the Heavenly Realm’s rules. Those who cannot adapt will be expelled!” Zhang Daotian spoke again, causing the crowd’s faces to shift.

“Do not underestimate these rules. If mishandled, you may truly perish on the way!” Zhang Daotian saw their confusion and warned.

“Next, our path may become increasingly difficult. Not only will the depletion increase, but pressure will also grow!” Zhang Daotian spoke again.

Chapter 1756: Opponents from the Three Thousand Worlds

“Go!” Luotian spoke, his voice resolute. Now that things had reached this point, they had no path back—there was no return.

“Let me do my utmost to protect them!” Luotian mentally vowed, taking another step forward.

The crowd nodded, following Luotian deeper into the Immortal Path. The rule’s power gradually intensified.

Time flowed slowly, like a frog in boiling water. At first, they felt nothing but slight discomfort. However, as time passed, it reached a boiling point. The overwhelming rule power finally erupted.

“Puk…” Someone could not endure it, spitting blood. Their body aged visibly in an instant, with a crackling sound.

“Damn it…” The man roared, eyes filled with resentment. He vanished before their shocked gazes—his vitality drained into a pile of bones.

“This…” People gaped, recognizing the old man. He was an elder from a major faction of the Ancient Clans—long-lived, barely ascending to near-Imperial King status. Now he perished here.

“It’s because his lifespan was insufficient!” Zhang Daotian spoke softly, a sigh in his eyes. The deeper they went, the more they approached the Heavenly Realm’s rules. Time flowed differently here than in the Nine Domains.

The crowd fell silent, fear creeping into their hearts. As time passed, they felt their lifespans shortening at a terrifying rate—this made them anxious.

Not only lifespan, but their physical functions also changed. Their internal Epoch energy slowed increasingly, as if frozen—this rule did not acknowledge the existence of Epoch energy.

They felt that in the Nine Domains, they could pluck stars and tread moons. Now, even lifting a mountain felt difficult.

“This rule is too oppressive! If it’s this way in the Heavenly Realm, will we be reduced to commoners?” Diaodezhu and others roared.

“Approximately. My strength in the Heavenly Realm is nothing, which is why we loved life in the Nine Domains. We did not wish to return to the Heavenly Realm—it’s too stifling!” Duhongxi and others sighed. They were not greatly constrained by the rules, having already adapted to them.

“Damn it!” The crowd cursed inwardly. Not only did they feel weak, but pressure increased—Luotian was no exception. Among so many people, only Zhang Daotian, the Demon Lord, and Duhongxi, Guanyuxin, etc., were unaffected.

“Stay strong!” Zhang Daotian addressed them, stepping forward. Yet he could not change anything—this was something they had to face themselves.

“How long must we endure this!” The crowd roared. As they walked further, pressure grew heavier. Gazing at the seemingly endless Immortal Path, despair crept in.

“Do not think about how long you endure. Think about adapting! You must adapt to the rules; if you cannot, even a Tian Dao realm master will be consumed by them!” Zhang Daotian roared.

“Wum…” Before Zhang Daotian’s words finished, waves of energy pressed upon him, the Demon Lord, and Duhongxi. In their shocked gazes, Zhang Daotian and others—unconstrained by the rules—gradually became translucent before vanishing from Luotian’s group.

“This…” Luotian and others gaped, watching Zhang Daotian vanish into the Immortal Path.

“Where did they go? Did they speak too much and get…” Sun Kelnian’s face was pale, his voice trembling.

“Your mother!” Before Sun Kelnian could finish, Luotian, under immense pressure, approached him and smothered his words.

“Hah…” Diaodezhu and others sighed deeply, relieved that Sun Kelnian’s words were not spoken. Otherwise, Zhang Daotian and others might have truly been in danger.

“Sun Kelnian, how many times did we remind you not to speak recklessly? You don’t know your own mouth’s accuracy, do you?” Diaodezhu roared, his eyes filled with caution.

They had thoroughly experienced Sun Kelnian’s toxic tongue over the years. Whatever he said, ten times out of ten came true—yet what he intentionally said was never accurate.

“Ah… a mistake! I suppose they truly entered the Heavenly Realm!” Sun Kelnian’s face bore embarrassment. He did not know why, but his unintentional words often came true—yet they were never good. Intentionally spoken ones were never accurate.

“Enough. Our masters should be fine. Perhaps they truly entered the Heavenly Realm, as Sun Kelnian said. After all, they were once from the Heavenly Realm. For now, we must adapt to these rules. Without our masters’ guidance, we can only rely on ourselves!” Luotian sighed deeply, halting his steps to adapt.

But as he just stopped, the Immortal Path behind him began to vanish slowly.

“Damn it! Won’t you let us stop!” Luotian cursed, then took another step forward toward Long Jie and Diaodezhu.

Others had no choice but to grit their teeth, pressing deeper into the Immortal Path. Their speed slowed, yet they were relieved that the path’s disappearance matched their pace—slower for them, slower for it.

“How to adapt?” Luotian pondered, seeking clever solutions. After all, brute resistance was not the way. He might endure it, but others could not.

“Rules… rules!” Luotian muttered repeatedly. He gazed at the painful expressions of others, beginning to think.

“Mortals, consider yourself a mortal!” Luotian whispered. He ceased using divine energy to resist and instead imagined himself as a mortal—when he was truly weak.

“Useful!” His eyes flashed with light, feeling the pressure lessen.

“Wum…” As Luotian marveled, waves of energy rose again. Gu Tianshu’s figure, like Zhang Daotian before him, began to blur.

“Do not consider yourself at the level of a near-epoch master!” Gu Tianshu shouted, then vanished from sight.

“What?” Their faces bore confusion. Yet before they could react, Luotian’s voice echoed.

“Correct! Imagine yourself as a mortal walking on an ordinary continent!” Luotian addressed them, then felt an inexplicable force upon him. His vision swam.

“Luotian!” In their sight, Luotian vanished from his spot, leaving them in a uproar.

“Damn it! Too fast. I didn’t even finish speaking!” Luotian cursed inwardly, the scene changing around him.

A mountain. Luotian fell there awkwardly, a smile on his face. He gazed around.

“This…?” Luotian’s eyes bore confusion, sensing the rules here were identical to those he had just adapted to in the Heavenly Realm. The rocks felt unusually hard.

“Wum…” As Luotian pondered, waves of energy rose from a hundred zhang away. A white-clad figure fell there as well, awkwardly.

The white-clothed figure stood up immediately. At first confused, he then saw Luotian watching him.

The fallen person looked like Luotian—equally young, with a jade-like appearance. His long hair was carelessly spread. The most striking feature was his eyes—black, with no white, like an eagle’s eye. Luotian could sense a proud aura from his gaze.

While Luotian observed the youth, the latter also studied him. Upon seeing Luotian, his eagle-like eyes narrowed slightly.

“Two of us—only one can survive!” A sense arose in both Luotian and the youth.

“Tian Dao realm!” The youth felt Luotian’s cultivation, exclaiming in surprise.

“Damn it! I encountered a Tian Dao realm master. But I still have a chance. The rules here differ from our world, so perhaps I can kill him with near-Tian Dao realm strength. But I must catch him off guard!” The youth thought, then devised a plan.

“Near-Tian Dao realm?” Luotian’s face bore a smile, feeling his luck was good—his assignment had been a near-Tian Dao realm opponent.

“Kill…” But as Luotian smiled, the eagle-eyed youth moved instantly. He leaped like an eagle, his feet pushing off the ground while a pair of silver hooks appeared in his hands. He attacked Luotian, and an eagle’s form rose behind him.
