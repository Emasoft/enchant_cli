“Respected elder, please speak!” Luo Tian muttered to himself in his heart, sensing that the sparrow's words carried hidden meanings. However, after the sparrow spoke only once, it fell silent.

Luo Tian gazed at Liu Yangwei, and Liu Yangwei gazed back at Luo Tian. They locked eyes for several breaths before Liu Yangwei resumed his usual demeanor.

"Ye Liangchen, it's just those few spirit stones. I can afford to lose; next time, I'll reclaim what I've lost!" Liu Yangwei shouted at Ye Liangchen with a furious yet indifferent air.

"Ye Liangchen, he's not a spoiled brat!" Luo Tian's heart jolted. In that moment of confrontation with Liu Yangwei, he had glimpsed excitement in the latter's eyes.

Chapter 1901: Treatment

"Excitement!" That exhilaration was the thrill of encountering an opponent. Luo Tian had felt this before in his youth, such as when he first saw Yang Huanyu and sensed an archenemy. Now, he had seen that same feeling in Liu Yangwei's eyes—but it was Liu Yangwei who regarded him as an enemy. Yet, Luo Tian felt the same sense of rivalry from Liu Yangwei.

"Haha, Tiange, today I've won. Let's go have some fun!" Ye Liangchen grinned triumphantly, ignoring Liu Yangwei's departure. He laughed at Luo Tian and began dividing the spoils.

"Brother Liangchen, we should return to the Lower Heavens first," Luo Tian said as he accepted the storage pouch and distributed it to Xuan Dan. He couldn't explain why an unease lingered in his heart.

"Uh..."

"Alright, let's get back to business. Business is important!" Ye Liangchen stammered before sending the earth dragon back to Star River Mansion. After all, this victory had brought him triumph.

They marched majestically through the arena under envious glances, arrogantly exiting toward the teleportation array.

They vanished from sight as they activated the teleportation array.

"Buzz..." Just as Ye Liangchen and his companions disappeared, several figures materialized in the city of Huan Tian, their faces cold.

"According to the Seer's prophecy, the one who killed the Elder is in Huan Tian!" Their auras were formidable as they whispered among themselves.

"Huan Tian isn't like other places. We must investigate discreetly, not use brute force," one of them said, his aura indicating a True Immortal at the middle stage.

"Correct. The Elder's killer must be powerful, likely a True Immortal at the middle or late stage. If we can't match them, we must send word back to the Elder immediately and wait for him to eliminate them!" They discussed, then dispersed in different directions.

...

The teleportation's energy surged as Luo Tian and his companions appeared on Huan Tian Island. Upon arrival, a loud laugh echoed into their ears.

Several figures stood outside the teleportation array, gazing at Luo Tian and his group. The leader, pale-faced as if dying of illness, was Jiang Yuzhe. Behind him stood the Master of Huan Tian Island, Jiang Huantian, and Fang Zhengyang.

"Brother Luo, my master has been waiting for a long time!" Jiang Huantian laughed and addressed Luo Tian.

"Big brother!" Ye Liangchen saw Jiang Yuzhe's pallid face and laughed heartily, his eyes filled with excitement as he looked at Jiang Yuzhe.

"Liachen has come too! I heard you defeated Liu Yangwei," Jiang Yuzhe chuckled, patting Ye Liangchen's shoulder.

"Ha! You couldn't hide it from Big Brother!" Ye Liangchen grinned, clearly pleased by Jiang Yuzhe's praise.

"Alright, I know Liu Yangwei. He must have relied on Brother Luo's strength," Jiang Yuzhe smiled, looking at Luo Tian.

"I knew it. You couldn't hide from Big Brother. You don't know how he turned the tide! No one expected that sparrow, but he did. That final move of his—spitting out a red lotus... Even now, I still find it terrifying!" Ye Liangchen spoke eloquently, recounting the events.

"Unbelievable! Such a powerful person was hiding in our Huan Tian Island's arena!" Jiang Yuzhe frowned, having heard reports from his subordinates. He felt the red lotus resembled something he had seen before.

"Brother Luo, I've prepared what you needed. May I ask if you can cure my chronic illness?" Jiang Yuzhe smiled, his face pale as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Brother Jiang, I'll do my utmost!" Luo Tian straightened his posture and gazed at Jiang Yuzhe, still confident.

"Good. If I recover, from now on, you and I are brothers!" Jiang Yuzhe chuckled, leading Luo Tian and the others into the Master's residence.

...

In the following days, thunderous sounds echoed throughout the mansion. Lightning rained like droplets, astonishing the people of Huan Tian Island.

"Little Brother, these pills should be enough for you to reach the late stage of Heavenly Immortality!" Xuan Dan sighed, surprised that Luo Tian had transformed all of Jiang Yuzhe's gifts into pills to enhance his cultivation, leaving none for Jiang Yuzhe. Even Xuan Dan felt Luo Tian was too greedy.

"Don't worry, Brother. As long as I can cure Brother Jiang, even if I had to take over the entire Huan Tian Island, he'd give it to me!" Luo Tian smiled.

Though his words were like that, Luo Tian knew he wouldn't live to enjoy it. Greed was a great mistake.

"Alright, I should go cure Brother Jiang!" Luo Tian gathered the pills, adjusted his attire, and stepped out of the room toward Jiang Yuzhe's residence.

"Brother Jiang, are you ready? It might be painful!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed Jiang Yuzhe.

"I'm ready! If it can cure this chronic illness, what's pain? I've suffered for years!" Jiang Yuzhe coughed.

"Good. Then I'll begin!" Luo Tian took out a silver needle and a black, unremarkable pill.

A harrowing scream echoed repeatedly. A cold aura spread from Jiang Yuzhe's courtyard, enveloping the entire Huan Tian Mansion. Black mist surged like entering an endless hell.

For seven days, that dark mist vanished, and sunlight entered the Huan Tian Mansion. The people of Huan Tian Island sighed in relief.

"Haha..." A long roar echoed through the island, shaking the people's minds.

"It's Master Yuzhe!" Jiang Huantian's face lit up with joy, vanishing from his room.

"It's Big Brother's voice!" Ye Liangchen's eyes gleamed with joy, stepping out of his courtyard.

"Brother Luo, from now on, you are my brother!" Jiang Yuzhe's face had a rosy hue, his sweat-drenched clothes as he gazed at Luo Tian, pale-faced.

"Congratulations on Brother Jiang's recovery. With two more months of rest, he'll be fully healed!" Luo Tian, pale-faced, stepped out of the courtyard and met Jiang Huantian and Ye Liangchen.

"Unsurpassed!" Luo Tian smiled at Jiang Huantian's group before heading to his own residence.

After leaving Jiang Huantian, Luo Tian's face returned to normal. He sighed inwardly at the difficulty of acting.

Returning to his residence, Luo Tian smiled and sat cross-legged on the bed. He took out several pills.

These were the items Jiang Yuzhe had given him, transformed by Xuan Dan into sixth-grade pills. These could elevate Luo Tian to the late stage of Heavenly Immortality.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian swallowed the pills. The potent medicinal energy surged through his dantian, flowing toward the golden-black immortal pill.

Seven days later, tremors erupted across Huan Tian Island. Not one but two locations—Luo Tian's courtyard and Jiang Yuzhe's—generated whirlwinds, greedily absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy. They seemed to coordinate without competing, their absorption spreading across ten li, then a hundred.

The entire world paused. Then two streaks of light rose into the sky, colliding mid-air. Luo Tian and Jiang Yuzhe stood atop the sky, their robes fluttering like two rising suns.

"Congratulations on Brother Luo's advancement to the late stage of Heavenly Immortality!" Jiang Yuzhe, elegant as jade, gazed at Luo Tian's calm face.

"Congratulations on Brother Jiang's recovery and his advancement to the late stage of Heavenly Immortality. I didn't expect you to recover so quickly!" Luo Tian responded, their gazes locking before looking into the distance.

"Brother Luo, this Lower Heavens isn't your destination. Join me and dominate the nine heavens!" Jiang Yuzhe's face bore arrogance as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Brother Jiang, I enjoy viewing scenery. The beauty of the journey!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the people below.

"Alright, Brother Jiang. If anything happens, don't hesitate to find me. I've made you my friend. Tomorrow, I must return to where I belong!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke softly, his voice carrying a battle spirit.

"Take care, Brother Jiang. I hope when we reach the summit, you'll see all mountains beneath you!" Luo Tian laughed.

"Brother Xuan Dan and Brother Liangchen, we should depart now!" Luo Tian addressed Xuan Dan and Ye Liangchen.

"Big Brother, where are we going?" Ye Liangchen asked loudly, looking at Luo Tian and Jiang Yuzhe in the sky.

"To Luantian Mountain to avenge!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered. Now that he was at the late stage of Heavenly Immortality, with Xuan Dan by his side, he no longer feared Luantian Sect.

"Luantian Sect? To avenge?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Xuan Dan's body trembled. He knew Luo Tian bore the Heart-Devouring Magic, and with Long Jie's dragon scales stripped and Chen Zhanbiao's grudge, this hatred had long been a thorn in Luo Tian's heart.

"Haha, Big Brother, did that sect bully you? No problem. Today I'll lead people to destroy Luantian Sect!" Ye Liangchen laughed arrogantly, dismissing the sect as trivial.

"Brother Luo, Guan Hongseng isn't simple. Be cautious!" Jiang Huantian mused before addressing Luo Tian.

Duanchengfeng was stunned by Luo Tian's words, not expecting him to be so bold as to target Luantian Sect. Yet he knew Luo Tian, like himself, bore the Heart-Devouring Magic.

"Master Jiang, I have confidence. If I can't even flatten Luantian Mountain, how could I dominate all mountains?" Luo Tian laughed and soared into the sky from Huan Tian City.

"Interesting. Yanlan, is this your Luo Tian?" Outside the teleportation array of Huan Tian Island stood a man and woman, like a pair of soulmates. The man was handsome; the woman was radiant.

Chapter 1911: Three Assaults on Luantian Mountain

Under the blue sky, thirty figures flew through the air with arrogance. This was Luo Tian's group.

"Big Brother, after helping you reclaim your honor, we'll head to the Endless Forest to find Star River Mansion!" Ye Liangchen addressed Luo Tian. To him, it was merely a lesson for Luantian Sect, unaware that Luo Tian intended to kill many.

"Yes, Brother Liangchen. I'll take care of the task you entrusted me with. I guarantee to find Star River Mansion and bring it back to our sect!" Luo Tian replied.

Ye Liangchen's group was strong—seven True Immortals. They could easily overwhelm Luantian Sect, but they wouldn't risk their lives for Luo Tian. Most would just hold back. If it were a life-or-death battle, they might stand by. But for Luo Tian, their presence was enough to intimidate.

After several days of flight, they finally reached Luantian Mountain. Luo Tian's face bore a wistful expression—this was his third visit to Luantian Mountain.

The first time, he had annihilated thirty thousand disciples and elders of Luantian Sect. Elder Yao Tiancheng arrived, but Luo Tian had been thoroughly defeated, the first time in centuries he felt so helpless. This made him abandon his underestimation of Guan Hongseng and realize the latter's deep cunning.

The second time, he had come with Li Changfeng to intimidate Luantian Sect. But the intimidation failed, and Guan Hongseng had called upon sect leaders from the Lower Heavens to neutralize them.

This was the third time. Luo Tian sought revenge, no matter what methods Guan Hongseng used—he would kill him. The hatred was one reason, but another was his fear of Guan Hongseng's enigmatic nature.

"Who dares to fly so arrogantly over Luantian Sect?" As they flew over the sect's domain, a chorus of shouts erupted from within Luantian Sect.

"Luotian!" However, after the shout, Luantian Sect's disciples recognized Luo Tian. A tumultuous uproar spread through the sect.

"Who is this pest returning again!" Luantian Sect's disciples and elders gasped, their eyes filled with anger as they gazed at Luo Tian standing in the sky. When they saw who stood behind him, their faces turned pale.

"Big Brother, I didn't expect you to be so famous in Luantian Sect!" Ye Xingchen sighed, watching the uproar of Luantian Sect.

"True Immortals! Seven True Immortals! Where did they come from!" Luantian Sect's disciples trembled. They didn't think Luo Tian had come to visit.

"Luotian, why have you brought people to my Luantian Sect? What's your purpose?" Ye Liangchen shouted, his voice as arrogant as ever. His eyes swept over Luantian Sect's disciples.

"Luotian, we've reached an agreement with Master Li. Past grudges are settled. Why have you come to stir up trouble again?" A furious voice echoed as Guan Hongseng appeared, his aura formidable.

"Half-True Immortal already?" Luo Tian's heart jolted. The last time he saw Guan Hongseng, the latter was at the peak of Heavenly Immortality. How long had it been? Guan Hongseng had advanced to Half-True Immortal, an astonishing speed. Luo Tian guessed it was related to the Heart-Devouring Magic.

"Killing! Revenge!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his gaze locked on Guan Hongseng, radiating an icy aura.

"Seems you haven't suffered enough yet!" Guan Hongseng's face curled into a sneer. He had thought Luo Tian would bring Xuan Dan to use his favor to remove the Heart-Devouring Magic. But Luo Tian had come for revenge.

"Duan Chengfeng, is he really here to avenge? You're the same—here to kill?" Guan Hongseng's eyes held amusement as he looked at Duan Chengfeng.

"Damn it, I didn't expect a sect leader from the Middle Heavens to be so bold!"

"Come here, kneel and apologize! Do you know who I am?" Ye Liangchen saw Guan Hongseng's demeanor and shouted.

"Exactly! Daring to act so smug, pretending to be a big shot!" Several aristocrats joined in shouting, their voices filled with arrogance. Few dared to challenge them, especially not from the Lower Heavens.

"I don't know who you are," Guan Hongseng looked at Ye Liangchen and the aristocrats, his eyes flickering.

"Middle Heavens, Star River Mansion. Have you heard of it? My father is the Master of Star River Mansion, Ye Wudao. My uncle is the Head of Iron Blood Hall, Ye Tian. My grandfather..." Ye Liangchen spoke loudly, listing several people, leaving Luo Tian stunned.

"Star River Mansion. Ye Liangchen!" Upon hearing Ye Liangchen's words, Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi's faces changed abruptly.

Guan Hongseng's brows furrowed slightly, his gaze on Ye Liangchen shifting.

Middle Heavens, Star River Mansion—everyone knew it. Besides the Nine Immortal Mountains, who dared to offend Star River Mansion?

"Haha, I didn't know the prodigy of Star River Mansion had come to my Lower Heavens. My apologies for any offense!" Fan Tianming laughed, his previous arrogance gone as he bowed to Ye Liangchen.

"Brother Luo, may I speak with you alone?" Guan Hongseng's gaze was deep as he looked at Luo Tian.

"What is it? There's no need for a private talk. If you have any last words, speak quickly!" Luo Tian smiled coldly, knowing Guan Hongseng's intentions.

"Arrogant! Arrogant! Then don't blame me for being harsh!"

"I was defeated before, and you ignored my words. Luo Tian! Duan Chengfeng!" Guan Hongseng shouted, his voice commanding, eyes flashing black symbols.

"Madness!" Everyone's faces showed disbelief as they looked at Guan Hongseng, not expecting him to say such words.

Some Luantian Sect disciples wore bitter expressions, their eyes filled with shock. They hadn't expected Duan Chengfeng to actually kneel.

"Master, don't!" As people were stunned, Duan Chengfeng's voice rang out. He knelt in the sky, shouting.

"Rumors spread," everyone was shocked. They hadn't expected Duan Chengfeng to actually kneel—this was the Elder of Tianmen Sect!

"Luo Tian, don't you dare to kneel? I'll give you one last chance. Kneel and beg for mercy, take your people and leave. Otherwise, you won't survive today's consequences!" Guan Hongseng's face was cold as he shouted, his gaze on Luo Tian.

But Luo Tian stood there, smiling coldly, gazing at Guan Hongseng.

"From today on, Luantian Sect will not kill those who surrender!" Luo Tian spoke coldly.

"Luo Tian, you truly seek death!" Duan Chengfeng, kneeling there, smiled coldly.

"I know. Some among you have the Heart-Devouring Magic and dare not speak against Guan Hongseng. But I, Luo Tian, can promise that if you surrender, I'll help you remove the Heart-Devouring Magic!" Luo Tian ignored Guan Hongseng's words, speaking again, causing a stir.

"What!"

"Heart-Devouring Magic!" Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi's faces showed disbelief. Even Ye Liangchen's group trembled, their gazes turning to Guan Hongseng.

"Such a lost art—how could anyone still know it? Didn't the Heart-Devouring Sage get executed?" Several Star River Mansion elders with True Immortal early stage faces showed disbelief.

"Guan Hongseng, hand over this secret technique. We'll let you live!" Several Star River Mansion elders' faces flashed with light, their gazes on Guan Hongseng.

"Haha, Luo Tian. Since you've exposed my secret, it's no big deal. I've decided to kill everyone here, especially Ye Liangchen's group. If they're all under my control, then Star River Mansion will be mine!" Guan Hongseng laughed.

"Buzz..." An invisible wave rose from Guan Hongseng's hands. Duan Chengfeng turned pale, moving away from Luo Tian, fearing being caught in the wave.

"Guan Hongseng, you're very calculating. But you're too arrogant. You've overlooked others. The Heart-Devouring Magic is strong, but not unsolvable!" Luo Tian's face was mocking as he looked at Guan Hongseng, allowing the wave to affect him. The震仙笔 (Shenxian Pen) was summoned, its divine laws flowing.

"Today, I'll kill you!" Luo Tian waved his hand, golden characters roaring toward Guan Hongseng.

"How is this possible! The Heart-Devouring Magic—no longer sensed!" Guan Hongseng's face showed disbelief, watching Luo Tian approaching.

"Rumors spread," everyone was shocked. They hadn't expected the Heart-Devouring Magic to be truly removed.

"It's really been removed!" Everyone's eyes glowed with light, not expecting anyone to remove the Heart-Devouring Magic.

"Dead!" Guan Hongseng's face darkened. His aura suddenly changed, black mist swirling around him as he raised his hand, forming a seal. A surge of dark energy erupted from Guan Hongseng's body, instantly凝聚 into a ghostly face that charged toward the golden character.

Chapter 1912: Heart-Devouring Ritual

"Boom..." The ghostly face collided with the golden character, exploding at Luo Tian and Guan Hongseng's heads. The shockwave spread outward.

"Buzz..." The gray Shenxian Pen became a blur, pressing down on Guan Hongseng.

"Go back! Advancing to the late stage of Heavenly Immortality, do you think you can match me?" Guan Hongseng's eyes were filled with killing intent. A black staff appeared in his hand, its head shaped like a ghostly face that smiled and wept alternately.

The Heart-Devouring Magic was Guan Hongseng's greatest secret and a key to his cultivation. But Luo Tian had managed to break it. How could he let Luo Tian live?

"Is this the Demon-Devouring Staff, the weapon of the Heart-Devouring Sage! Also an Upper-grade Immortal Artifact! This Luantian Sect Master must have inherited the Heart-Devouring Sage's legacy!" Several True Immortal early-stage elders surrounded Ye Liangchen's group, their gazes filled with caution.

The Heart-Devouring Sage was renowned in history. Alongside the Calligraphy and Painting Immortal, his illusions had ensnared many.

"Crack..." The collision sound echoed in people's ears, like a thunderclap.

In an instant, Luo Tian and Guan Hongseng retreated. Luo Tian's arms felt numb, as if they weren't his own. His palms were torn open.

Guan Hongseng's face also changed slightly. Now he was Half-True Immortal, but after a battle, he had fought evenly with Luo Tian.

"Kill..." Luo Tian switched to holding the pen with both hands, rushing toward Guan Hongseng. He knew if he fought by cultivation alone, he might not match Guan Hongseng. The latter had the Heart-Devouring Sage's inheritance, with more techniques. Only by fighting with his body could he kill Guan Hongseng.

"Regretful I left you this nuisance until now!" Guan Hongseng sneered, seeing Ye Liangchen's group of True Immortals didn't move. He rushed toward Luo Tian, too. He had a secret weapon but didn't want to use it. Fighting Luo Tian alone suited his desires.

"Boom... Boom..." The collision sounds kept echoing. Both wielded Upper-grade Immortal Artifacts, neither gaining an advantage. Guan Hongseng's cultivation was two stages higher than Luo Tian's, but Luo Tian's body was strong and his techniques astonishing. Combined with many great techniques, he could match Guan Hongseng.

"This kid isn't simple!" Star River Mansion's elders showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian.

"That's right. Don't you see? My Big Brother is truly called!" Ye Liangchen spoke loudly, his voice filled with pride.

"What are you all staring at? Help me! Kill the Master and leave!" Ye Liangchen showed impatience.

"The Heart-Devouring Magic must be preserved. If the Young Master masters it, his strength will surely increase!"

"Not just the Young Master. If all of Star River Mansion could cultivate the Heart-Devouring Magic, we'd definitely become the top power in the Middle Heavens, second only to the Nine Immortal Mountains!" Several True Immortals' faces showed fervor.

"But Star River Mansion would never cultivate such a dark art!" Ye Liangchen spoke softly. No one saw the depth in his eyes—this was not a spoiled aristocrat's gaze.

"Master is mistaken. In the Immortal world, it's survival of the fittest. What is a dark art? Killing innocent people is a dark art. If one has principles and boundaries, what's wrong with cultivating it?"

"Looking at the Immortal world, all kings—down to the sect leaders of the Lower Heavens, up to the Immortal Kings of the Nine Immortal Mountains—each is stained with blood. Take Master Ye's father, Ye Tianzhang. How many innocent lives have his hands stained?"

"However, the Heart-Devouring Magic is too powerful. It can boost cultivation rapidly. If misused by those with ill intent, it would cause chaos. But the Young Master is pure-hearted, though spoiled, he has principles. This Heart-Devouring Magic suits him perfectly!" One True Immortal elder spoke, his voice filled with admiration.

"But this Heart-Devouring Magic is crucial. It's not accepted by anyone, so we must silence them!" One True Immortal elder's face was cold as he looked at Xuan Dan, Yao Tiancheng, and Luantian Sect's disciples.

"No!" Ye Liangchen shouted. He wouldn't allow the massacre of Luantian Sect's disciples, even if it meant killing so many innocent people.

"Not everyone must be killed. Just make a blood oath to keep it secret!" Several True Immortals' faces were cold.

"I'll think about it," Ye Liangchen shook his head lightly, gazing at Luo Tian locked in battle with Guan Hongseng.

"Boom... Boom..." The sky trembled. Luo Tian and Guan Hongseng clashed again, separating with both looking battered. They gazed at each other.

"Strong... Astonishing..."

Guan Hongseng looked at Luo Tian, knowing he was strong. But he hadn't expected him to be so变态 (perverted), fighting this long and evenly.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian coughed up blood, his face pale. He sighed inwardly, acknowledging it was a close call.

But Luo Tian knew Guan Hongseng's condition wasn't good, perhaps even worse than his. After all, his unique body had a stronger recovery ability.

"Kill..." Luo Tian caught his breath and rushed toward Guan Hongseng again.

"Kid, I'm not playing anymore!"

"I've nurtured you this long. Today's the time to reap!" Guan Hongseng's face was cold as he reached out.

"Buzz..." In an instant, an invisible wave surged from Guan Hongseng's body, instantly enveloping Luantian Sect.

Duan Chengfeng stood there, his body trembling violently. His face was pale as he gazed at Guan Hongseng.

"Master, spare me! I'm a True Immortal late stage, about to reach the peak. I'm also an Elder of Tianmen Sect. I can serve you!" Duan Chengfeng shouted, feeling the black symbols in his dantian devouring his cultivation.

"Master's mercy!" The disciples of Luantian Sect also cried out, their faces pale. These were the sect's elite, chosen by Guan Hongseng and marked with Heart-Devouring Magic.

Guan Hongseng's face was grotesque as he gazed at Luo Tian. His hatred for Luo Tian had reached its peak. If it weren't for Luo Tian, his careful plans would have been unstoppable. But now everything was exposed.

One by one, the disciples' faces turned pale as they begged for mercy. They felt their cultivation rapidly draining. The black symbol serpents devoured their strength, eventually forming a single black magic seed that flew from their dantian. This seed represented all their strength.

"One... Ten... A hundred..." Black magic seeds rose, like black stars filling the sky.

"Crack..." Guan Hongseng clashed with Luo Tian again, his body retreating. He looked at the sky full of magic seeds, his face grotesque.

"Today, none of you will escape!" Guan Hongseng spoke loudly. He then opened his mouth to suck in a vast number of magic seeds.

Guan Hongseng's aura rapidly surged. His dantian emitted a crackling sound, and black mist rose around his body.

"So many! He can't let him absorb all of them. These magic seeds could elevate him to the late stage of True Immortal, maybe even the middle! Then we might truly be unable to handle him!" Seeing the sky full of magic seeds, the True Immortals accompanying Ye Liangchen finally couldn't hold back.

"Master Yao... Master Mei, help me stop them. After I break through, I'll eliminate them all. You'll surely get your rewards!" Guan Hongseng coldly addressed Yao Tiancheng and Mei Gueqi.

"You dare! If you two move, I'll kill you on the spot!" A senior spoke, rushing toward Guan Hongseng.

"I can't stop them. I can't!" Fan Tianming spoke loudly, knowing Guan Hongseng had already failed and might even drag the entire Luantian Sect down.

"Good. It seems you've spoiled them!"

"Now, one last chance to stop them!" Guan Hongseng's face was grotesque as he addressed Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi, his eyes flashing black symbols.

"Ah... Guan Hongseng! You... you've also marked us with the Heart-Devouring Magic! How did we not know!" Yao Tiancheng and Mei Gueqi shouted, their voices filled with anger.

"Old man, in Luantian Sect, I wouldn't allow anyone outside my control. Go stop them, or you two will become like them!" Guan Hongseng pointed his finger, indicating the pale Luantian Sect disciples and elders.

They had all been stripped of their cultivation, now no better than commoners.

"Even you, Duan Chengfeng. I'll spare your life. Now, fight to block them for me!" Guan Hongseng addressed Duan Chengfeng again.

"Die!" As Guan Hongseng gave orders, Luo Tian and Xuan Dan, who had already reacted, along with two True Immortal early-stage Star River Mansion elders, attacked Guan Hongseng's front.

"Buzz..." The golden character surged with overwhelming power, and Xuan Dan three others also unleashed powerful techniques.

"Think you can kill me? You're not qualified!" Guan Hongseng's face was mocking, his eyes flashing cold light.

"Heart-Devouring Ritual! Heart's Illusion!" Guan Hongseng's cold voice echoed as he gazed at Luo Tian and the others.

As Guan Hongseng looked at them, their flying bodies suddenly stopped. Their techniques were about to be unleashed but halted.

Chapter 1913: All Mine

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sounds exploded over Luo Tian and the others' heads. Violent waves struck their bodies.

"What's happening? Why are they like this?" Ye Liangchen and others watched Luo Tian's eyes turn black, their gazes filled with confusion.

"Ku ku..." A cold laugh echoed through the world. The ghostly face on Guan Hongseng's Demon-Devouring Staff smiled mysteriously.

"It's an illusion! They've all been marked with illusions!" Several True Immortal elders shouted, not daring to attack immediately and halting their movements.

"Today, none of you will escape. Thanks to this kid for bringing you all here!" Guan Hongseng devoured the magic seeds, laughing.

"Now, block them for me! I'll perform this illusion to trap them. You go and injure them!" Guan Hongseng addressed Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi, his voice commanding.

"Yes..." Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi's faces showed reluctance. They rushed toward Ye Liangchen's group.

"Luo Tian, you've finally died in my hands!" Duan Chengfeng's face was grotesque as he gazed at Luo Tian, flying up.

At this moment, Luo Tian was wounded by his own technique. His body trembled, black mist swirling in his eyes as he stood atop the sky.

"Don't give in!" Luo Tian felt himself trapped in another world. Endless darkness, endless loneliness—no life existed. The entire world seemed to be just Luo Tian.

"Where am I?" Luo Tian wondered, seeing nothing. His legs kept running, trying to escape this world's constraints.

"Did you think not looking into my eyes would save you?" Guan Hongseng looked at Ye Liangchen's group not looking at him, his face scornful.

"Devouring Eyes! Reveal!" Guan Hongseng spoke coldly, his Demon-Devouring Staff's ghostly face eyes flashing black light. The light spread into the sky, entering the magic seeds.

"Buzz..." Waves rose. Each black magic seed transformed instantly into a pair of black eyes, slowly opening. They glowed with an eerie light, cold and menacing, looking at Ye Liangchen and Luantian Sect's people like ants.

Next moment, the disciples of Luantian Sect had confused expressions. Their eyes seemed to be assimilated by the sky's black eyes, then looking around with confusion.

"Kill..." The entire Luantian Sect became chaotic. Disciples fell into various illusions, some standing motionless, others attacking their companions.

The most tragic were those who had just lost their cultivation to Guan Hongseng. They were doomed to be slaughtered, dying in droves.

Duan Chengfeng, Fan Tianming, and Mei Gueqi were unaffected by the black eyes. Duan Chengfeng rushed toward Luo Tian, while Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi stood near Guan Hongseng, their faces bitter as they cautiously watched Ye Liangchen's group.
