“Two masters from the middle era of the epoch, their power has reached terrifying levels. How could Gu Tianshu withstand it!” Yan Xiuluo and others looked anxious, watching Gu Tianshu standing in the Sanctuary of the Gods, eager to see how he would respond.

Gu Tianshu's gaze first turned solemn. His eyes gazed at the two divine clan elders whose essence had already dissipated into the Nine Heavens Map.

“Hum…” The golden Divine King Nine Heavens Map expanded rapidly under the influx of two middle-era elders’ power, its heavy aura instantly enveloping Gu Tianshu. The ultimate purification force caused white smoke to rise from his flesh and blood.

Thunderous echoes resounded. The Nine Heavens Map resembled a blazing sun, seemingly capable of subduing everything. Even Luotian and Diao Yuanshan from the ancient heavenly palace felt the immense pressure.

Gu Tianshu’s face remained solemn. His hands moved swiftly, and a crimson sea of fire erupted from his grasp, sweeping across the eight directions. The fire transformed into a barrier that materialized above Gu Tianshu’s head.

“Boom…!” The reinforced Nine Heavens Map emitted thunderous roars. The entire Sanctuary of the Gods seemed transformed into an ancient battlefield, with golden figures constantly evolving and collapsing within the map. These figures were absorbed into the Nine Heavens Map, making it appear as if it were a true divine technique beyond ordinary martial arts.

“I’ll see just how powerful your life-or-death effort truly is!” Gu Tianshu’s long hair fluttered as his body suddenly expanded to a thousand zhang in height, resembling an ancient giant.

“What technique is this!” People from beyond the domain stared in shock, watching Gu Tianshu’s sudden expansion with expressions of disbelief.

“Boom…” In the moment of their astonishment, the Divine King Nine Heavens Map collided with the fire barrier Gu Tianshu had raised.

The indestructible fire barrier instantly transformed into a sea of flames, spreading outward and striking Gu Tianshu’s front.

“Go away…” The thousand-zhang Gu Tianshu raised both hands in a sky-lifting posture, meeting the descending Divine King Nine Heavens Map.

“Crack…” Lightning bolts continuously shot from Gu Tianshu’s hands. His massive body suddenly bent, kneeling on the ground as the entire divine clan continent instantly sank a thousand zhang.

“This…” People’s faces showed terror, watching Gu Tianshu who had absorbed the Divine King Nine Heavens Map. They all took a sharp breath.

“Is this even human!” The divine clan disciples beyond the continent looked helpless, their eyes filled with a sense of powerlessness.

“Crack…” Although Gu Tianshu had absorbed the Divine King Nine Heavens Map, he also suffered severe injuries. His body returned to normal size, coughing up blood with a pale face, staining his white robe red.

“Hum…” The humming sound returned. The divine clan’s sacred mountain sounded again with thunderous roars, and the two elders reappeared in people's sight.

“Who are you!” The two elders opened their eyes, gazing at Gu Tianshu who was coughing blood. Their eyes showed intense disbelief.

“Gu Tianshu!” Gu Tianshu slowly stood up, his posture still upright. He gazed at the two middle-era masters with a pale face.

“Take Luotian away!” Gu Tianshu’s voice echoed in Diao Yuanshan’s mind, causing the latter to glance at Luotian with a flicker of expression.

“Yes!” Diao Yuanshan did not hesitate, bowing to Gu Tianshu and pulling Luotian away.

“Grandfather!” Luotian called out loudly to Gu Tianshu, unwilling to leave.

“Go! These two old men can’t harm me!” Gu Tianshu smiled slightly, speaking to Luotian. Though his face was pale, his voice remained confident.

“Arrogant! Although you are powerful, being struck by our divine clan’s forbidden techniques means you’re not as easy as you seem!” The two newly arrived elders scolded Gu Tianshu.

“Ha! If even the Dao itself cannot subdue me, what are your divine clan’s forbidden techniques!” Gu Tianshu roared, transforming into a red light and charging toward the two divine clan elders again.

The clamor of battle rose. The Divine Emperor Sword was activated by the two elders, slicing toward Gu Tianshu. The elders sneered: “How long can you withstand the epoch treasure!”

“Go!” Diao Yuanshan’s face suddenly changed, pulling Luotian and vanishing beneath the ancient heavenly palace.

Seeing Diao Yuanshan taking Luotian out of the ancient heavenly palace, Gu Tianshu smiled: “I’ll thoroughly stir up a commotion today. I want to see how many divine clan elders you have left to kill!”

“Hum…” Gu Tianshu’s voice was cold. He waved his hand, and the ancient heavenly palace instantly hovered above him. Red symbols were imprinted into the ancient heavenly palace, and a terrifying aura once again swept across the divine clan continent.

“Without the ancient heavenly palace, how could those two survive!” The two divine clan elders sneered. The Divine Emperor Sword slashed a brilliant sword beam, rushing toward the direction where Luotian and Diao Yuanshan had fled.

Chapter 1124: Desperate Situation

Beyond the divine clan domain, Diao Yuanshan and Luotian appeared simultaneously in the starry sky. Their gazes were deep. As they just emerged outside the domain, two more divine clan elders activated the Divine Emperor Sword, launching a brilliant sword beam that cut across the heavens and instantly appeared behind them.

An epoch treasure activated by middle-era masters—how terrifying! Even Gu Tianshu had to rely on it to withstand.

“Damn!” Diao Yuanshan’s face paled. He instantly appeared in front of Luotian, filling the space around them with a vast aura of purple. At the same time, Luotian summoned the Epoch Bell to block in front of them.

Diao Yuanshan exerted all his strength, summoning two pseudo-epoch treasures. Combined with his full cultivation, three pseudo-epoch treasures were positioned in front of them.

“Rely on yourselves!” Gu Tianshu’s face was solemn. He gazed at the sword beam that made him wary, his expression cold as he activated the ancient heavenly palace and charged toward the two divine clan elders.

“Hmph! A wounded body dares to fight two!” The two divine clan elders sneered, transforming into golden streaks. They activated the Divine Emperor Sword without hesitation and rushed toward Gu Tianshu.

“Has it come to this?” The divine clan’s kings and disciples watched the apocalyptic sword beam, their eyes filled with alarm. In their view, Luotian and Diao Yuanshan would surely die under this strike.

“Done!” Nan Gong Yuyu stood before the Demon King, knowing Luotian and Diao Yuanshan were doomed. Unless another epoch treasure appeared, even with three pseudo-epoch treasures, they would die. That sword beam was despair incarnate.

“Block it!” Luotian’s eyes showed determination, watching the sword beam approach. He continuously recalled his secrets, knowing he and Diao Yuanshan could not withstand this beam—only an epoch treasure could save them.

“Epoch Book!” In a flash, Luotian suddenly remembered the Epoch Book in his mind. Though he did not know its level, he knew it was mysteriously powerful and exclusive to the Epoch Lord.

“Come out! If you don’t, your master will die!” Luotian roared to the sky, his eyes wild with madness. His furious soul repeatedly struck the golden Epoch Book in his mind.

“Haha, desperate struggle!” The divine clan people sneered at Luotian’s madness, sighing deeply.

“Hum…” A humming sound echoed within Luotian’s body. It seemed to sense the real danger, and after a long silence, the Epoch Book slowly flew out of his mind.

“Rustle…!” The golden Epoch Book resembled a star, illuminating the entire sky. Its pages continuously flipped, appearing above Luotian and Diao Yuanshan, radiating golden symbols that enveloped them.

“What is this?” People saw the Epoch Book above Luotian and Diao Yuanshan, their faces filled with shock. Though the Epoch Book was not yet complete, it still radiated supreme power, like a master of the entire sky.

“That’s the Epoch Book!” Zhou Tianxing from the Star Realm Master stared wide-eyed, his expression filled with disbelief.

“Of course! This kid is so reckless. It’s because he obtained the Epoch Book!” Yan Xiuluo spoke in disbelief, his eyes filled with intense shock.

“Impossible! Our divine clan has a single page of the Epoch Book, but how could he have so much!” Sun Shengtian shouted, staring at the rustling Epoch Book with eyes full of shock.

Everyone gazed at the Epoch Book above Luotian and Diao Yuanshan, understanding its power. Even masters of sects showed shock, knowing the Epoch Book was exclusive to the Epoch Lord. Their gazes toward Luotian changed.

“Boom…!” Thunderous roars echoed as the golden sword beam collided with the barrier formed by the Epoch Book. The violent energy overturned vast stretches of space.

One was a legendary artifact, the exclusive treasure of the Epoch Lord. The other was an ultimate weapon forged by the Epoch Lord. Both were closely tied to the Epoch Lord, and their collision produced terrifying energy, no less than that of two epoch treasures colliding.

The thunderous roar was overwhelming. Even through the barrier formed by the Epoch Book, Luotian and Diao Yuanshan’s pseudo-epoch treasures shattered instantly, transforming into violent storms that swept over them.

“Cough… cough…” Luotian and Diao Yuanshan were caught in the storm, coughing blood within the barrier. Diao Yuanshan was better off, being a middle-era master who had suffered heavy injuries but not fundamental harm.

Luotian was far worse, his flesh and blood seemingly on the verge of collapse. If not for Diao Yuanshan’s protection, he would already be annihilated.

“Survived!” Despite this, people were still shocked. They had not expected Luotian to survive such a desperate situation.

“Stories say that those who obtain the Epoch Book have extraordinary luck. This saying is indeed true!” Zhou Tianxing from the Star Realm Master showed a hint of admiration, watching Luotian coughing blood.

“From now on, the Shrouded Domain will stop hunting him!” Yan Xiuluo spoke softly, causing people to gasp.

“Fear! The Shrouded Domain, known for being able to kill anyone except the Epoch Lord, now begins to fear a saint’s late-stage prodigy!” People looked at Luotian with changing gazes, recalling his emergence in the nine domains. He had shown invincible talent, reminiscent of the Epoch Lord’s youth.

As Yan Xiuluo’s words fell, all sect masters transmitted to their disciples, ordering them not to provoke Luotian. If they could forge an alliance, it would be a great achievement for their sects.

“Damn!” Sun Shengtian’s face was grim. He gazed at Luotian and Diao Yuanshan who had calmed down, realizing the divine clan had truly lost heavily. The entire divine clan continent, except for the sacred mountains, was nearly destroyed. Disciples were killed and injured in droves. The Supreme Body disciple Sun Mengru defected from the divine clan. Most painful was having to summon four elders.

“Divine clan disciples, listen! Kill Luotian!” Sun Shengtian’s face was cold as he issued a death order to Luotian. He knew if they failed this time, they would never kill Luotian. If Luotian truly matured, the divine clan would face an unprecedented enemy.

“Yes!” Divine clan disciples roared lowly, gazing at Luotian and Diao Yuanshan. They instantly surrounded them.

“Cough… cough, Sun Shengtian, you’ve thought it through. I’m not dead yet! As long as I’m alive, you can’t stop me!” Diao Yuanshan coughed twice, his face pale as he spoke to Sun Shengtian.

“Last gasp. After so many battles, how much strength do you have left?” Sun Shengtian’s voice was icy. He raised his hand, activating the Divine King Nine Heavens Map to crush Diao Yuanshan and Luotian.

“Kill!” Divine clan disciples roared, millions of disciples instantly launching countless martial arts into the Nine Heavens Map. The map’s power became even more overwhelming.

Though the divine clan’s combined attack was powerful, it still lagged behind the sword beam activated by the Divine Emperor Sword.

“Hum…” The golden Epoch Book seemed enraged, emitting ten thousand feet of light. It enveloped Luotian and Diao Yuanshan again.

The thunderous sound echoed, though not as intense as before. It still caused Luotian and Diao Yuanshan to cough blood, their flesh and bones seeming ready to collapse at any moment.

“Crack…” Diao Yuanshan took out two sacred herbs, giving one to Luotian. They chewed them instantly. These herbs were left by Meng Yunxiao when they exited the ancient heavenly palace for emergency use.

At this moment, Diao Yuanshan needed to recover his cultivation. There would be more battles ahead. Luotian needed healing, as Diao Yuanshan could feel even with his protection, Luotian couldn’t withstand a third strike.

However, Diao Yuanshan soon realized his worries were unnecessary. The Epoch Book above the sky seemed stimulated, emitting continuous humming sounds. The sound was piercing and fierce, like a roar.

The golden Epoch Book suddenly flickered, its golden symbols dimming and brightening. Like meteors, they flew out from the Epoch Book, carrying powerful energy that seemed to belong to no world. They rapidly flew around.

“Ten thousand… a hundred thousand…” The symbols multiplied, each one powerful. They instantly scattered onto the divine clan disciples surrounding Luotian and Diao Yuanshan.

“Boom… boom…” The golden symbols wasted no time, all striking the divine clan disciples. Bloodlight flooded the sky, and cries of pain echoed throughout space. Any divine disciple struck by a golden symbol turned into blood mist.

In an instant, millions of divine clan disciples were annihilated. Blood formed a long river flowing through the stars.

The Epoch Book emitted a violent suction, forming an invisible vortex that swept the blood river into itself.

“Terrifying!” Luotian and Diao Yuanshan stood under the Epoch Book, their faces filled with intense shock as they gazed at the blood vortex above.

At this moment, a ten-mile radius around them became a vacuum. The divine clan disciples were instantly annihilated in such numbers that Sun Shengtian’s face was grim. He stood outside the crowd, gazing at the Epoch Book above Luotian.

Chapter 1125: Breaking Through the Encirclement

Beyond the divine clan domain, the golden Epoch Book emitted dazzling light, illuminating the entire sky. The blood vortex spun, absorbing into the Epoch Book.

Everyone’s eyes showed fear as they gazed at the radiant Epoch Book above Luotian. They had not expected him to possess such a powerful weapon.

“Opportunity! Go!” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes flickered. Taking advantage of the divine clan’s momentary distraction, he activated the Purple Qi Eastcoming Step, lifting Luotian and instantly vanishing from the spot. They rushed toward the divine clan’s crowd.

Purple light flickered as Diao Yuanshan flew, continuously activating the Purple Qi Eastcoming Step. He struck repeatedly, and divine clan disciples fell into blood pools, forming a path of blood.

In an instant, Diao Yuanshan led Luotian out of the crowd. He gazed at Sun Shengtian: “This time, I remember!”

Diao Yuanshan spoke loudly. His voice echoed through the vast starry sky, cold and merciless, causing the divine clan people to snap back to reality.

At the same time, the Epoch Book absorbed all the blood energy and transformed into a stream of light that returned to Luotian’s head. However, the Epoch Book did not issue another barrier but hovered above Luotian’s head, emitting continuous humming sounds and strange waves.

“Hmm?” Luotian stood under the Epoch Book. His brows slightly furrowed, sensing something unusual about it. He did not know what the mysterious Epoch Book was planning.

“Kill!” Sun Shengtian’s face darkened. He watched Luotian and Diao Yuanshan escape the crowd. He shouted to the divine clan disciples, his body radiating powerful energy. He no longer held back but rushed toward Luotian and Diao Yuanshan, knowing if he did not act now, Diao Yuanshan’s speed would allow them to escape.

Thunderous roars echoed. Sun Shengtian’s body radiated powerful energy, followed by three saint-level masters and divine clan elders. They surged like a golden flood toward Luotian.

“Go!” Diao Yuanshan’s face showed mockery. Previously surrounded, he might have had no chance, but now that they had broken free, Diao Yuanshan was confident his speed could not be caught even by a middle-era master.

Diao Yuanshan grabbed Luotian again, his body flickering as he rushed toward the distance. However, as they just moved, Luotian’s face showed joy.

“Divine clan, this time I’ll make you pay the price!” Luotian mocked, allowing Diao Yuanshan to carry him away.

“What does that mean?” Yan Xiuluo and others heard Luotian’s words, frowning. They could not figure out what secret Luotian had left.

“Hum…” As people were confused, the Epoch Book still lingering in place emitted more light. A powerful summoning intent emerged from it.

“Boom…!” As the Epoch Book emitted a summoning intent, the divine clan continent, already devastated by Gu Tianshu and two divine clan elders, suddenly emitted thunderous roars.

“Boom…” A corner of the sacred mountain cracked open. Golden light flashed from the fissure, shooting straight into the sky.

“What happened!” The two divine clan elders currently fighting Gu Tianshu showed surprise, a bad feeling rising in their hearts.

“While fighting me, you still distracted yourself?” Gu Tianshu’s face was pale. Seeing them distracted, he struck both elders with his fists. Golden blood splattered, and the two elders’ faces were also pale, clearly wounded by Gu Tianshu’s punch.

In space, the summoning intent grew stronger. It seemed like a resonance had occurred. Golden light spread across the sacred mountain.

“I see!” Sun Shengtian’s face darkened. He shouted toward the divine clan continent: “Elder, be careful of the Epoch Book’s fragment. It might be summoned!”

Sun Shengtian rushed toward Diao Yuanshan’s direction after shouting.

“What?” Hearing Sun Shengtian’s words, the two divine clan elders’ faces suddenly changed. One of them rushed toward the golden light.

“I understand! That summoning intent is calling for the divine clan’s Epoch Book fragment!” Yan Xiuluo and others suddenly realized.

“If another fragment is lost, the divine clan will suffer a great loss!” Hun Dun Domain Master spoke, his eyes flashing. He watched the high-hanging Epoch Book.

“It is said that the divine clan’s three great techniques were cultivated from this fragment. If Luotian obtains it, when he grows up, the divine clan will have no chance of victory!” Zhou Tianxing’s face showed admiration.

“Spit…!” Golden paper emerged from the earth, instantly appearing on the divine clan’s sacred mountain. At the same time, that divine clan elder also appeared before the golden paper with a grim face. A golden hand凝聚ed, reaching for the Epoch Book fragment.

However, soon after, that divine clan elder’s face turned completely grim. The golden Epoch Book fragment, though thin like a sheet of paper, radiated sharp energy and was faster than the divine clan elder.

The golden paper instantly sliced through space, even cutting off the divine clan elder’s withered hands.

“Even able to cut down a middle-era body, like cutting tofu!” People’s eyes showed intense shock. They finally felt the Epoch Book’s terrifying nature.

“Rustle…!” In an instant, the divine clan’s Epoch Book fragment merged with Luotian’s Epoch Book. Glowing light flashed, disappearing from people’s sight and flying toward the direction where Diao Yuanshan and Luotian had left.

“The divine clan truly suffered a great loss. A single Luotian caused the divine clan to be in chaos!” People’s faces showed sighs, watching the disappearing Epoch Book.

“Go, see if Luotian can escape!” Someone spoke. Their bodies flickered, following the divine clan’s army chasing Luotian and Diao Yuanshan to see the result.

Some people also did not leave. They wanted to watch the battle between Gu Tianshu and the two divine clan elders. Such a battle was rare in millennia.

“Hum…” The vibration spread. Diao Yuanshan and Luotian appeared at the boundary of the divine and demon realms, within the range of the Divine Demon Ancient Cave. Diao Yuanshan’s face showed mockery. He could feel that Sun Shengtian and the divine clan disciples were like a flood, rushing toward their direction.

“Hmph! Catching me is just dreaming!” Diao Yuanshan’s face showed confidence. He was confident that with a day, he would enter the demon realm from the entrance. Once in the demon realm, he and Luotian would be completely safe. Even the divine clan could not interfere there.

As they just landed, the golden Epoch Book instantly appeared before them. It flew into Luotian’s mind.

“Indeed, the divine clan’s fragment of the Epoch Book is now in my hands!” Luotian smiled lightly, his eyes filled with excitement. However, he soon remembered Gu Tianshu. At present, he and Diao Yuanshan were temporarily safe. With Diao Yuanshan’s extreme speed, the divine clan could not catch them. But he did not know if Gu Tianshu truly had a chance to escape.

“Don’t worry. Master Gu is so brilliant. If he says he has a chance, then he truly does!” Diao Yuanshan saw Luotian’s worry and comforted him.

“Urgent matter: we must leave the divine and demon realms to not let Master Gu be distracted!” Diao Yuanshan caught his breath, then grabbed Luotian again and rushed toward the demon realm’s territory.

“Ha! You still want to run? I’ve been waiting for you all this time!” As Diao Yuanshan just took a step, the surroundings lit up with streaks of light, surrounding them. A female voice echoed.

“Who!” Diao Yuanshan’s face instantly darkened. Purple energy surrounded them, and he gazed around.

“Of course, an enemy. That kid killed my son. I naturally want to avenge my son!” The answer was still a distant female voice, with no figure appearing.

“Come out!” Diao Yuanshan roared. The stars trembled, and he struck toward all directions. That barrier set by others was strong but could not withstand Diao Yuanshan. After three punches, it shattered instantly.

“I am who you don’t care about. What matters is that this time, for the divine clan, it’s enough! When you two fight each other, I’ll come to finish you. Hmm… you’re old but your blood energy is strong. That kid, don’t worry. Although you killed my son, I’ll take good care of you!” A voice that made people uncomfortable echoed in Luotian and Diao Yuanshan’s minds, then fell silent.

“Diao Yuanshan, where are you going!” As Diao Yuanshan was about to take another step, behind him thunderous roars echoed. Sun Shengtian instantly arrived with the divine clan disciples, rushing toward Luotian and Diao Yuanshan.

“Kill!” Sun Shengtian was clearly enraged. No matter what, he wanted to keep Luotian and Diao Yuanshan in the divine and demon realms. He launched his full strength, causing the entire space to tremble again.

“Damn!” Seeing the divine clan disciples instantly surrounding them, Diao Yuanshan’s face suddenly changed.

“Epoch Book!” Luotian roared, his voice echoing through space. His powerful soul again struck toward the Epoch Book.

“Boom…” Hearing Luotian’s roar, the divine clan people suddenly stopped. They had been too terrified by the Epoch Book before. In an instant, millions were annihilated.

“Your mother!” However, soon after, Luotian couldn’t help but curse, his face turning grim again.

Chapter 1126: Reinforcement

Under the stars, Luotian stood with a grim face. He tried to activate the Epoch Book again but found it unresponsive, like an old man ignoring him.

“Your mother! This is even less reliable than Wan Lingkong!” Luotian cursed under his breath, then gazed at the dense divine clan disciples around him with a deep expression.

“Haha! It’s no longer useful. That terrifying Epoch Book doesn’t obey him!” The divine clan people laughed, relieved after the previous fear of the Epoch Book.

“Kid, since it’s no longer useful, I’ll send you two to your deaths!” Sun Shengtian was also delighted. He gazed at Diao Yuanshan and Luotian.

Although Diao Yuanshan was a middle-era master, he had just entered and was injured. After consecutive battles, even almost dying, Sun Shengtian did not believe Diao Yuanshan was still his opponent.

“Kill!” Sun Shengtian strode forward, transforming into a blazing sun. He led three saint-level divine clan elders toward Diao Yuanshan and Luotian.

At the same time, numerous divine clan disciples did not advance but stood at a distance. They launched martial arts toward Luotian.

“Damn!” Diao Yuanshan’s face turned completely grim. Seeing Sun Shengtian and the three saint-level elders rushing toward him, although he had confidence, his current state was not good. If it weren’t for the sacred herbs restoring him, he wouldn’t have the strength to fight.

Diao Yuanshan was confident he could escape but had no chance of handling Luotian.

“Master Diao, if you can escape, go. Don’t worry about me!” Luotian looked at Diao Yuanshan with a bitter expression, speaking softly.

“Kid, you’ve given up. It’s just a desperate situation. Don’t worry. Since I brought you out, I’ll definitely bring you back. Otherwise, Longzu and my grandson would have to fight with me!” Diao Yuanshan gazed at the four approaching Sun Shengtian, his eyes filled with intense battle spirit.

“Go! I’ll hold these four old men back. The rest is up to you!” Diao Yuanshan spoke to Luotian, his body rising into the sky. Purple energy spread across space, instantly appearing before Sun Shengtian and the three saint-level elders. He struck with a hand, thunderous echoes resounding. His purple hand seemed to subdue everything, rushing toward Sun Shengtian and the four.

Luotian stood behind Diao Yuanshan, gazing at the dense divine clan disciples. His eyes gradually turned cold. He spotted Sun Miechen among them, who was looking at him with mockery.

“Since you want to kill me Luotian, I’ll first kill your son!” Luotian’s eyes deepened. He broke free from Diao Yuanshan’s protection and rushed toward the divine clan disciples.

“Boom…!” As Luotian broke free from Diao Yuanshan’s four combat circles, thunderous roars echoed in space. The divine clan disciples’ martial arts collided with Sun Shengtian and the four saint-level elders’ attacks.

“Spit…” Diao Yuanshan coughed up blood, his face pale like a sheet of paper. However, his battle spirit was stronger. He activated the Purple Qi Eastcoming Step and fought against Sun Shengtian and the three saint-level elders. The powerful energy made the divine clan disciples feel fear.

“Although I can’t help you withstand saint-level masters, I can at least protect you from the divine clan disciples!” Luotian sighed softly. His eyes were filled with killing intent, no fear at all. Black energy spread from his body, rushing toward the divine clan disciples.

“Die!” Sun Miechen stood among the crowd. Seeing Luotian rushing toward so many people alone, his eyes showed mockery. He moved swiftly and activated the Divine King Nine Heavens Map to crush Luotian.

“Die first!” Luotian roared, his Dao energy spreading. He used the ultimate method to break all methods and activated the Brahma Attack, striking toward the Nine Heavens Map above. He ignored the martial arts from other divine clan disciples.

“Crack…” Thunder resounded. Under Luotian’s desperate strike, Sun Miechen’s Divine King Nine Heavens Map shattered instantly. The space exploded.

Although Luotian had shattered the Divine King Nine Heavens Map, other divine clan disciples’ martial arts instantly struck Luotian. The apocalyptic martial arts made Luotian feel despair. Even in his strongest state, he would have been doomed facing so many combined attacks.

The Ghost Step activated. Luotian moved like a ghost, trying to avoid some martial arts. Indeed, in life-or-death situations, Luotian unleashed endless potential. Countless martial arts were dodged.

But the number of martial arts was too great. Even a prodigy could not avoid them all. Waves of powerful martial arts struck Luotian’s body.

“Cough… cough…” Thunderous echoes continued. Luotian kept coughing blood, appearing before the divine clan disciples.

“Truly powerful!” The divine clan people watched Luotian, his face pale and flesh and bones on the verge of collapse. Even enemies couldn’t help but admire Luotian’s tenacity. In such a situation, even saint-level masters might not withstand it. But injured Luotian had found a chance to survive.

“Kill!” Luotian did not stop. His eyes were blood-red, fixated on Sun Miechen. He rushed toward him.

“Now you are not my opponent!” Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed cold. He admitted he was slightly inferior to Luotian, but in that situation, Sun Miechen himself would have been doomed.

“I’ll die to take you down with me!” Luotian’s face was pale, moving like a ghost. He instantly appeared before Sun Miechen at the front of the divine clan disciples, striking with a fist.

“Go away!” Sun Miechen’s face flashed cold. He roared, showing no fear. His golden fist thundered out, colliding with Luotian.

“Kill!” Although the divine clan disciples were shocked by Luotian’s tenacity, they did not hold back. Their fierce martial arts formed a golden flood, rushing toward Luotian who had been pushed back by Sun Miechen.

“Spit…” Sun Miechen’s body retreated, his eyes filled with disbelief. He had not expected Luotian at the end of his strength to still have such combat power, pushing him back.

“End!” Watching the divine clan disciples’ apocalyptic martial arts, Sun Miechen shook his head. He knew Luotian had no chance of survival this time. Although Luotian’s combat power was extraordinary, he was still a saint-level late-stage. Previously facing the divine clan disciples’ combined attack, Luotian’s survival was sheer luck.

“Done!” Luotian sighed silently. He knew, even if he survived this time, he had no strength left and would become a fish to be slaughtered.

“Damn!” Diao Yuanshan, who was fighting Sun Shengtian and the four, had been watching Luotian. Seeing Luotian in danger, his face turned grim. He wanted to rescue but was held back by Sun Shengtian and the four, unable to break free.

“Haha! Diao Yuanshan, when that kid dies, it’ll be your turn!” Sun Shengtian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He continuously activated the divine clan’s great techniques, attacking Diao Yuanshan.

“Roar…” As people felt Luotian was doomed, a thunderous dragon roar echoed throughout the stars. The sound carried powerful authority, like a king’s presence.

Golden light flickered. A golden dragon sliced through the stars, instantly appearing before Luotian. It spat out countless essences.

“Luotian, you’re too unkind! You came to the divine clan secretly. This is such a great opportunity to make a name, but you didn’t even give me!” The voice echoed from the golden dragon’s head. Several young figures appeared in people’s sight.

“Don’t talk nonsense, you’re just trying to show off!” The voice thundered, mocking without hesitation.

“You!” Seeing the golden dragon instantly, Luotian knew who had arrived. It was Long Jie and others—his life-and-death brothers.

Dragon power spread. The dragon’s head, with Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Diao Yuanshan among others, watched the divine clan disciples’ combined martial arts. Their faces showed concern.

“Don’t talk anymore. First, block it! If we can’t block, we’ll all die!” Xu Liyi’s voice echoed. His tone was more solemn.

“Hum…” The humming sound returned. Their bodies glowed with powerful light, spiritual energy surged like it was free, gathering together to protect them.

At the same time, they pulled Luotian onto the dragon’s head. Their eyes all showed smiles: “You kid, I knew you’d be reckless!”

“You!” Luotian’s eyes showed emotion. He hadn’t expected these people to come to the divine and demon realms at this critical moment.

“Crack…” Thunderous roars echoed in their ears. The golden dragon continuously retreated, splashing a lot of dragon blood onto the stars. The heads of Gu Lei and Zheng Xin also turned pale, coughing up blood.
