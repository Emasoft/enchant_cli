“Damn, I was just talking!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he silently cursed himself for having a mouth as sharp as Sun Ke Nian’s.

The four massive bone figures, however, were unaware of Luo Tian’s thoughts, fighting purely on instinct. The white bone spirit bamboo transformed into bone spikes, lunging toward Luo Tian with such precision that they sealed all his escape routes.

“Yao Ming Ghost Step!” Facing attacks from all directions, Luo Tian had no choice but to take it seriously. Though these four bone figures contained only five or so pieces of bones from a准纪元之主 (Disciple of the Supreme Era), they seemed to have been fused with some supreme alchemical technique, their attacks surpassing even the peak of the era.

Thus, even Luo Tian had to proceed with caution; he didn’t want to risk injury just after entering the White Bone Forest.

“Master Yin Yu, assist me!” Luo Tian mentally called out to Yin Yu, for the latter was now immensely powerful and surely could aid him.

“Kid, don’t even think about it. These four giants are formidable, but if you stay alert, there’s no danger. Fight more—this will do you good. Perhaps you’ll glimpse the path your future should take!” Yin Yu, however, remained unmoved, his voice echoing in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Your grandfather!” Luo Tian muttered under his breath, a fierce glint in his eyes. Though Yin Yu’s words were annoying, Luo Tian knew they held truth.

“Then let’s go!” Luo Tian roared, raising his hand as the Divine King Nine Heavens Map flew from his palm, crushing one of the bone figures. At the same time, he闪动 (dodged) to the front of the bone figure that had attacked him, unleashing the Great Dao Sealing Fist.

While Luo Tian battled the four formidable bone figures, Sun Mengru and others rushing toward him faced the same ordeal. Thunderous explosions echoed across the White Bone Forest.

The moment Luo Tian repelled one bone figure with a punch, golden bones rained down from the massive skeleton.

At the same time, the Divine King Nine Heavens Map crushed another bone figure. Yet neither of the two figures Luo Tian ignored nor the one he repelled with a punch forgot to attack him.

Four white bone spirit bamboo spikes split into four directions, pinning Luo Tian in place as they lunged at him with ferocity. His face shifted slightly.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed, managing to block two attacks but not four. Though he could withstand them, he opted to avoid injury by raising a pure white barrier around himself.

Almost instantly, the four bone spikes struck the barrier.

Chapter 1587: Searching for Someone ()

A crisp crack echoed across the white bone ground as Luo Tian’s barrier shattered, splintering into countless pure white fragments that scattered outward.

Yet the barrier had given Luo Tian time to react. As the four bone spikes neared him, he vanished from his spot.

“Plop…” Bones erupted from the ground where Luo Tian had stood, and his figure reappeared as a streak of white light before another massive skeleton. His fist struck again, sending more bones cascading from the figure’s body and dimming its aura slightly.

“Severing Heaven Seal!” A golden seal shot from Luo Tian’s hand, crushing another bone figure.

“Boom…!” The explosion echoed as the targeted skeleton trembled violently, seemingly on the verge of disintegration.

“King-Subjugating Battle Method!” Luo Tian, seeing the skeleton about to collapse, bent his body and launched himself forward without hesitation. Using his formidable physical strength, he collided with the skeleton.

“Crack…” The explosion echoed as the skeleton—Luo Tian’s primary target—was struck again by his King-Subjugating Battle Method. The massive figure could no longer withstand the assault and shattered into fragments, scattering as a storm of bones.

“Hum…” The disintegrating bones lost their divine essence, falling to the ground. Three golden bones transformed into three streaks of light, absorbed by Yin Yu’s spirit.

“Kid, I’ll take these three bones,” Yin Yu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. “Strive to gather a complete Disciple of the Supreme Era skeleton for me—I’ll switch bodies!”

“Old bastard!” Luo Tian grabbed a bone spike formed from the white bone spirit bamboo and hurled it to the ground. Before he could examine it further, his body闪动 (dodged) away from the remaining three bone figures.

“Another one!” Luo Tian smiled as he dashed toward the remaining three skeletons.

The King-Subjugating Battle Method, the Divine Heaven Attack, and the One-Fight-All method—three supreme martial arts—were imbued into Luo Tian. Soon, the second skeleton shattered under his fists.

Yet those pieces of Disciple of the Supreme Era bones were still collected by Yin Yu’s spirit, while the white bone spirit bamboo was stored in Luo Tian’s storage ring.

“Third… fourth…” As time passed, after an hour, Luo Tian smiled as he held four white bone spirit bamboo spikes.

“Though it has lost much vitality, if necessary, it could still be used!” Luo Tian muttered, sealing the bamboo and continuing deeper into the White Bone Forest.

“Kid, good job—no injuries!” Yin Yu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, laced with admiration.

“Ah…” As Luo Tian walked for a while, a series of screams echoed in his ears, making him frown and glance with confusion. The voice sounded familiar.

Before he could react, a streak of light appeared before him, the figure looking battered. Luo Tian’s brow furrowed.

“What happened? This voice is so familiar!” Luo Tian thought, knowing the White Bone Forest likely only held them. The person who screamed was probably one of their group.

“Luo Tian…” The streak of light, moving at lightning speed, reached Luo Tian’s side. Seeing him, the figure looked like a long-lost relative and landed before him.

“Zheng Xin? What happened to you?” Luo Tian recognized the battered figure, his face showing confusion.

“Boom…!” A golden skeleton appeared before Luo Tian and Zheng Xin.

“This thing is tough—I can’t fight it!” Zheng Xin spoke urgently to Luo Tian.

“Damn…” Luo Tian looked at Zheng Xin’s state and felt a headache. Though the skeleton was strong, Zheng Xin could easily defeat it with some sacrifice. This fool must have been intimidated by the aura of a Disciple of the Supreme Era skeleton on the figure.

“Get out!” Luo Tian kicked Zheng Xin away and transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward the massive bone figure.

“Haha, I’m smarter!” Zheng Xin smiled with pride. As soon as he saw Yin Yu, he rushed to Luo Tian’s side—he knew being with Luo Tian was the safest.

An hour later, Luo Tian held a white bone spirit bamboo spike, while several pieces of Disciple of the Supreme Era bones were collected by Yin Yu.

“Luo Tian truly is amazing—this powerful skeleton was shattered so quickly!” Zheng Xin praised Luo Tian, patting his back.

“Get lost, using me as a free fighter!” Luo Tian scolded Zheng Xin but felt relieved. Zheng Xin’s presence confirmed others were also in the White Bone Forest.

“How did you find me?” Luo Tian asked, knowing it was no easy task to locate someone in this endless White Bone Forest.

“You previously used Yin Yu, and the commotion was huge, so I came immediately!” Zheng Xin replied.

“Right!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up—why hadn’t he thought of creating a noticeable signal for others to find him?

“Hum…” A humming sound echoed from Luo Tian’s hand as the black Yin Yu hovered above him and Zheng Xin.

The black Yin Yu expanded, resembling a dark cloud drifting over the pale sky, glaringly obvious.

“Let’s see if they can find us!” Luo Tian spoke softly, standing still with Zheng Xin.

“Probably difficult,” Zheng Xin replied. “I absorbed so many skeletons through Yin Yu before, the commotion was huge. Now there are no more bones to collect, and this White Bone Forest is vast. I’m close enough to find you.”

“Try! Maybe someone else is as near as you and can find us!” Luo Tian replied softly. This was better than them both blindly searching.

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian and Zheng Xin stood still, Yin Yu hovering above them.

“Boom…!” After three hours, familiar explosions echoed as golden bone figures marched toward Luo Tian and Zheng Xin. Before them, a streak of purple light flickered.

“It’s Gouzi!” Recognizing the purple glow, Zheng Xin immediately identified the figure, his eyes lighting up with joy.

“Zheng Xin, damn it! Who’s a dog? Come help me!” Zheng Xing’s words had barely finished when Cao Dedu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian and Zheng Xin’s ears.

“Finally, someone found us!” Luo Tian smiled as Cao Dedu flew closer.

“Help me!” Cao Dedu, seeing Luo Tian and Zheng Xin, shouted with joy.

“You’ve always been invincible—why fear a skeleton!” Zheng Xin scoffed.

“Hum…” Before Zheng Xin’s words finished, a series of humming sounds rose behind the three. A white fish flickered, appearing above Luo Tian and his group.

“Sun Ke Nian has found us!” Seeing the fish, Luo Tian smiled and kicked off the ground, rushing toward Cao Dedu’s skeleton.

“You really don’t care about embarrassment! Even a bone scares you!” Sun Ke Nian appeared before Zheng Xin and Cao Dedu, his voice laced with mockery.

“Nonsense! You have the fish; we don’t. If we fight this thing, we’ll get hurt!” Zheng Xin and Cao Dedu shouted back.

“Boom…!” As the three spoke, Luo Tian also defeated Cao Dedu’s skeleton. Four pieces of Disciple of the Supreme Era bones hovered above Luo Tian.

“Hum…” Soon, the Yin-Yang dual fish emitted radiant light, enveloping the four bones.

“Damn it, this is mine—don’t fight me for it!”

“Nonsense! Who’s yours? Whoever grabs it is theirs!” The Yin-Yang dual fish’s voices echoed in Luo Tian and the others’ ears, leaving them stunned.

“This white fish truly found a real master—just like Sun Ke Nian, so shameless!” Zheng Xin and Cao Dedu looked at Sun Ke Nian with disdain.

“Alright, Cao Dedu, can you find others’ positions?” Luo Tian turned to Cao Dedu. He knew Sun Ke Nian had found them via the Yin-Yang dual fish, and Cao Dedu likely relied on his keen nose.

“This place is strange—it suppresses my sense of smell, but if I search carefully, it should be fine,” Cao Dedu replied softly, sniffing.

“Let’s find the others first!” Luo Tian spoke softly. Without finding them, he felt uneasy.

Chapter 1588: White Bone Palace ()

“Any progress?” The white bone ground echoed as Luo Tian, Zheng Xin, and Sun Ke Nian looked at Cao Dedu.

“Strange!” Cao Dedu frowned, his eyes filled with confusion before he spoke softly: “I could still sense their presence earlier, though faint. Now I can’t!”

“How is that possible?” Hearing Cao Dedu’s words, Luo Tian and the others furrowed their brows. They had planned to wait in place for a day before letting Cao Dedu find the others.

But now, after a day had passed, Cao Dedu couldn’t sense their presence—this made the group’s hearts tighten.

“Wait!” As Luo Tian and the others were confused, Cao Dedu’s voice echoed again.

“There is a place that has blocked my sense of smell!” Cao Dedu told them, his voice laced with seriousness.

“Let’s check it out—we can’t just wait here!” Luo Tian ordered Cao Dedu to lead the way, his heart anxious.

Cao Dedu didn’t hesitate; he闪动 (dodged) forward, guiding Luo Tian and the others toward the direction that had blocked his sense of smell.

The four traversed the White Bone Forest without incident, flying for nearly an hour.

“What is this?” As Luo Tian’s spiritual sense expanded, he sensed a colossal structure within it.

In his spiritual perception, a towering palace stood there, but unlike ordinary palaces, it was entirely built from white bones. The exterior was embedded with countless skull heads.

As Luo Tian marveled, the group drew closer to the massive palace. He also sensed several figures standing before it.

“They’re all here!” Luo Tian felt a surge of joy as he recognized the figures—Sun Mengru, Xu Liyi, and others.

However, their appearances were battered, with exhaustion in their eyes, making Luo Tian frown with confusion.

“Luo Tian…” Soon after the four arrived before Sun Mengru’s group, their faces turned tense. But upon seeing it was Luo Tian, they sighed in relief.

“How did you get so battered?” Luo Tian asked, his gaze cautious as he looked at the towering White Bone Palace.

Though the palace gave him a heavy pressure, it should be safe outside.

“This White Bone Palace holds my father’s inheritance!” Run Hongyu smiled bitterly, speaking to Luo Tian.

“But something has changed—it won’t open with my blood! If I’m not mistaken, this is where you seek the White Bone Spirit Bamboo!” Run Hongyu added.

“Hum…” As Run Hongyu’s words finished, a series of humming sounds echoed from the White Bone Palace. Divine laws spread out, and the golden palace began to change color.

“Another one!” Seeing the divine laws emitted by the palace, Xu Liyi and others’ faces darkened.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian asked Sun Mengru with confusion.

“We’ve been here for nearly half a day, and every hour, a bone tide erupts!” Sun Mengru spoke softly, her golden sword in hand.

“Bone tide?” Luo Tian and the others felt confused. If the White Bone Spirit Bamboo was indeed inside, they had to enter.

“We planned to open this palace and wait for you! But we couldn’t leave after arriving!” Xu Liyi explained to Luo Tian.

As Sun Mengru and Xu Liyi’s words ended, the golden bone palace suddenly changed color, turning pitch black. Black mist spilled from it, resembling a ghostly temple. Luo Tian’s heart sank.

The black mist erupted, forming runes that enveloped the group before seeping into the ground around them.

“Did you see the bone slot on the palace? If I’m not mistaken, to enter this palace, one must insert a complete Disciple of the Supreme Era skeleton!” Run Hongyu said solemnly.

“Hum…” The black mist rose, forming a dark barrier that enveloped Luo Tian and the group. Even Luo Tian felt this barrier was formidable.

“This spell is hard to break in a short time!” Wan Lingkong spoke, his voice laced with seriousness.

“Crash…!” Within a million miles, the black mist turned everything into ink-black. A series of black skeletons rose from the ground, forming into figures with powerful auras.

“Ten… one hundred…” Each skeleton held various weapons, appearing before Luo Tian’s eyes, making him gasp in shock.

Nearly a hundred skeletons, each like the ones Luo Tian had faced before, bore several pieces of Disciple of the Supreme Era bones.

“Kill all these and collect the Disciple of the Supreme Era bones—enough to form a complete one!” Run Hongyu spoke softly.

“How can we kill so many? Even a Disciple of the Supreme Era would bleed here!” Cao Dedu’s cold sweat flowed.

“This damn thing isn’t a death trap—how did you survive without any issues?” Zheng Xin’s face showed fear. This was clearly a death trap.

“To find the White Bone Spirit Bamboo inside this palace, we must kill these skeletons!” Wan Lingkong spoke softly before raising his hand. Golden array flags flew from his palm, planted around the group.

“Hum…” The humming sound echoed as golden barriers surrounded them, isolating them from the black skeletons.

Then, Wan Lingkong waved his hand, creating a hundred-foot gap in the barrier—just enough to let one skeleton enter.

“This bone tide occurs every hour, and this array can only last an hour. We’ll use this time to kill these skeletons!” Wan Lingkong explained to Luo Tian and the others before infusing his light into the array flags, maintaining their operation.

“Crack…” As Wan Lingkong spoke, a black figure rushed into the array, charging toward Sun Mengru at the gap.

“Kill!” Chen Zhanpiao and Gu Yongkang’s puppets emitted powerful waves, rushing toward the black skeleton. They clashed repeatedly with it, keeping it outside the barrier’s gap.

“Boom…!” On another side, the近百 (hundreds) of figures outside the barrier raised their weapons and slammed them against Wan Lingkong’s barrier.

“Unite to maintain the barrier!” Sun Mengru called out to Luo Tian and the others, her body radiating divine light that flowed into the array.

Others did the same, clearly experienced in these bone tides. Their bodies radiated various divine lights, flowing into the array.

The explosion echoed as powerful weapons smashed against Wan Lingkong’s barrier, making their faces pale instantly.

Luo Tian and Cao Dedu felt heavy-hearted; even with the barrier, it was taxing.

“Lingkong, open another gap! You three help maintain the array!” Luo Tian called out to Wan Lingkong.

“Good!” Knowing Luo Tian’s strength, Wan Lingkong didn’t hesitate. He grabbed a golden command flag and opened another gap in Luo Tian’s view.

“Crack…” A black skeleton, holding a black bone sword, rushed into the gap.

“Kill!” Luo Tian roared, rushing toward the black figure. The explosion echoed again within the barrier.

A single skeleton posed no pressure for Luo Tian, but he didn’t want Wan Lingkong to open too many gaps—others were focused on maintaining the array and couldn’t afford distractions.

After half an hour, the black skeleton shattered in Luo Tian’s hands, two black bones fading into gold and falling into his palm.

On the other side, Chen Zhanpiao and Gu Yongkang’s combined attack also shattered a skeleton, dropping two bones that they collected.

“Continue!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, standing at the barrier’s gap and rushing toward another skeleton.

For a while, everyone默契 (mutually understood) to collect the Disciple of the Supreme Era bones. With Cao Dedu and three others joining, maintaining the barrier became much more stable.

“Two… ten…” As time passed slowly, one hour of bone tide ended. Luo Tian’s storage ring now held ten more bones.

“Still need over a hundred…” Run Hongyu collected the bones Luo Tian and Chen Zhanpiao had gathered, speaking to the group.

“Ugh… wait, rest and prepare for the next bone tide!” The group sighed deeply, sitting to rest.

To their relief, these black skeletons didn’t increase in number but decreased as they killed them.

“Eighty… fifty…” After a day of battle, Run Hongyu finally exclaimed with joy.

“Enough…” Run Hongyu waved his hand, a golden-boned figure flying from his palm. This bone body alone was priceless.

The golden bones were embedded into the palace’s bone slots, and a series of explosions echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

Chapter 1589: White Bone Illusion ()

“Creak…” The golden door slowly opened. Luo Tian and the group stood within Wan Lingkong’s barrier, eyes filled with anticipation for the inheritance of a Supreme Era Master.

Luo Tian had encountered and obtained Supreme Era Masters’ inheritances before, seeing others do so too. No matter which Supreme Era Master left their inheritance, it was always powerful—gaining it would grant solid techniques.

“Boom… boom… boom…” As the golden door opened, the remaining twenty or so massive skeletons surrounding Luo Tian and the group also shattered, turning into bones that scattered on the ground. Dozens of powerful divine-bone pieces glowed with golden light, lying there.

“My!” The Yin-Yang dual fish immediately flew from Luo Tian and Sun Ke Nian’s sides, rushing toward the Disciple of the Supreme Era bones. The two spirit tools fought fiercely over them, forgetting they were once one.

After the dual fish’s quarrel ended, the white palace door slowly opened, revealing itself to Luo Tian and the group. Divine light spilled from within, blinding their vision.

“Go!” Run Hongyu spoke softly and闪动 (dodged) forward, leading Luo Tian and the group into the palace.

As they stepped in, they halted immediately. The door closed behind them, a fresh scent entering their senses.

“Is this an immortal realm?” Soon after, Cao Dedu, Zheng Xin, and Xu Liyi looked enchanted at the palace’s surroundings, exclaiming.

Their vision showed them in another world, unlike the bone-ridden exterior. The interior was grand and seemed to enter an immortal palace.

Mountains, rivers, bridges—misty vapors rose across the sky, making Luo Tian and the group enchanted. Faintly, they saw several immortal maidens dancing in a palace.

“Indeed!” Run Hongyu smiled with joy, his voice filled with excitement.

“What’s indeed?” Hearing Run Hongyu’s words, Luo Tian and the others looked curious, clearly unfamiliar with this place.

“My father was called the Supreme Master of Heaven; he once said that when he achieved the Supreme Era, he saw an immortal realm and immortals!” Run Hongyu spoke softly, his eyes filled with pride.

“This must be the illusion my father created based on what he saw!” Run Hongyu explained to Luo Tian and the group, his eyes filled with admiration.

“An illusion?” Hearing Run Hongyu’s words, Luo Tian and the others’ faces changed slightly. Though they were now at such a level that illusions weren’t a problem, Supreme Era Masters weren’t easy—many could be tricked.

“Haha…” Before they reacted, Luo Tian felt the surroundings change. Sun Mengru and Run Hongyu’s figures vanished from his sight.

The scene changed, and Luo Tian found himself on a mountain peak, white-haired but with an aura that pierced the heavens.

“Is this an illusion or reality?” His eyes reflected沧桑 (sorrow), his face showing pain, then gradually clearing.

Vast memories flooded Luo Tian’s mind, making him look bitter. His eyes grew melancholic.

In the memories, Luo Tian had swept through all enemies, eventually achieving that supreme position, subduing nine heavens and ten earths, conquering the ancient royal clans. He established a glorious era where humans and ancient tribes coexisted.

But even Supreme Era Masters couldn’t escape time’s passage. His face aged, and after nine million years—nearly an era—he had lost everyone: wife, family, friends. He could do nothing but bury them himself and seal his descendants, waiting for their revival.

Each July 7th, he visited the place where his loved ones were buried, offering sacrifices and sleeping there to arrange his great dream—dreaming of the past.

“Indeed, I’ve been experiencing an illusion all along! This is real!” Luo Tian muttered softly, standing on a stone at the mountain peak. His gaze looked into the distance, his body radiating loneliness.

“Nine million years!” Luo Tian sighed softly, then walked down the mountain. The entire peak was filled with graves marked with names—Sun Mengru, Jiang Sichai, Luo Nantian, and others.

“Hope the illusion was real!” Luo Tian muttered softly, his eyes filled with admiration as he walked past each grave.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, walking down the mountain and wandering through various star fields.

“Even if one is supreme, they can’t become immortal!” Luo Tian stood under the stars, gazing at the faint cosmos with a touch of sorrow.

“Red hair and white beard—solitude in the world. Is this the path I must walk?” Luo Tian muttered softly, his eyes filled with madness.

“Path is cut—what good is becoming a Supreme Era Master?” Luo Tian roared into the sky, shaking the entire cosmos.

“I can’t see the future path—this isn’t the one I should walk!” Luo Tian roared, gazing at the stars. His eyes gradually cleared, his aged face becoming young again. The surrounding scenery also changed.

“Huff…” Cold sweat flowed down Luo Tian’s face, and the scene returned to the White Bone Palace. Immortal music filled the air, with radiant light surrounding the small world.

“Too terrifying!” Luo Tian collapsed onto the ground, his eyes filled with fear. Tears streaked down his face—though the illusion lasted only a moment, it felt like he had truly experienced nine million years.

The illusion was too real—like a true experience. He had buried countless loved ones, and the feeling of pain was unbearable.

Even Luo Tian felt doubtful—was he now in an illusion? Was he already a supreme immortal, and had this illusion been cast upon him?

“Path! The path to supremacy!” Luo Tian kept thinking, his eyes becoming迷茫 (bewildered), muttering softly.

“Becoming a Supreme Era Master isn’t the path I want. Better to leave with my loved ones!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed determination.

“Even if this is an illusion, I am willing to drown in it with my loved ones!” Luo Tian roared, his voice echoing through the immortal realm.

“Hum…” Waves of energy descended upon Luo Tian, and the world that looked like an immortal realm shattered before his eyes.

Luo Tian found himself in a grand hall, his face filled with confusion. Though the hall was magnificent, it had become ordinary—no longer like before, with mist and light.

“Indeed an illusion!” Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with awe as he finally awoke, speaking in disbelief.

“From the moment we entered this hall, we were already in an illusion. The so-called immortal realm was just the Supreme Master of Heaven’s trick!” Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with confusion, then he saw his companions—Sun Mengru, Run Hongyu, Xu Liyi, and even Gu Yongkang’s puppet—all with closed eyes, expressions varying.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, feeling awe at the Supreme Master of Heaven’s power while also feeling admiration.

Luo Tian stepped forward to Sun Mengru, looking at her with a gentle gaze. He wanted to raise his hand and wake her up but stopped as a flash of light crossed his mind.

“Something’s off. The Supreme Master of Heaven’s inheritance was left for his son—why would he let people experience such an illusion without reason? If it’s left for his son, there must be a purpose!” Luo Tian muttered softly, his eyes filled with contemplation.

“Path…” Luo Tian kept recalling the illusion that felt real, muttering softly.

“My path—becoming a Supreme Era Master isn’t the one I want. The ancients said to become a Disciple of the Supreme Era, one must walk their own path. What is my path?”

“In the illusion, I became a Supreme Era Master but still wasn’t happy. I didn’t want to watch my loved ones leave one by one!”

“I need companionship,牵挂 (attachment), the presence of my loved ones and family. I want a path that is mine to choose!” Luo Tian’s eyes shone with determination.

“I will walk a path of my own, one that ensures my loved ones and friends are always by my side. Immortality isn’t my goal—I want everyone to follow me into eternal life!” Luo Tian’s eyes gradually cleared.

As his eyes cleared, the nine immortal bodies in his dantian began to roar with sound. The Nine Immortal Rebirth Technique started running on its own within his body.

“Boom…!” The explosion echoed in Luo Tian’s dantian as he stood firm, two immortal bodies colliding violently.

Chapter 1590: My Own Path ()

The explosion echoed in Luo Tian’s dantian, his face filled with determination. Two immortal bodies collided violently within his dantian, then exploded, leaving Luo Tian pale-faced.

“Nine Immortal Rebirth Technique!” Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with frustration and twisted expression.

“I must walk my own path—my own path!” Luo Tian’s eyes were resolute, his energy surging as the collision of two immortal bodies unleashed a powerful surge.

“Again!” Luo Tian wanted to roar but feared waking Sun Mengru and the others, so he stifled his voice.

“Boom…” Another two immortal bodies collided under Luo Tian’s control, transforming into a massive surge of Supreme Era energy within his dantian.
