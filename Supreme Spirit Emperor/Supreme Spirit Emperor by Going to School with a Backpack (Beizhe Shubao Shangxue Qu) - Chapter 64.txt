“Peng……” As the two women laughed, the front door suddenly shattered with a thunderous crash, scattering dust across the ground.

“Hmph…… Hand over whatever you’re holding! I, Longbao, have claimed these glowing items!” A petite figure appeared at the doorway, hands on hips, her childish voice echoing in everyone’s minds.

This deafening crash interrupted the quarreling master and servant, while others dropped their belongings, confusion etched on their faces as they turned toward the entrance.

“Huh? Where is she?” People scanned the doorway, finding no one—confusion spreading.

“Pfu….” The maid initially froze; Lishui City’s security was impeccable, and no one dared rob here. This was her first encounter with such audacity. But upon glancing, she saw Longbao’s comically defiant posture—hands on hips—and couldn’t suppress a laugh.

The Red-Cloaked Woman also blinked, then smiled faintly at Longbao’s cuteness. Who could stay angry at such an adorable child? She smiled, asking, “Little one, what’s your name? Where are your parents? Why are you alone?”

Yet the Red-Cloaked Woman was startled: this adorable boy seemed oblivious to her, drooling as he stared at the gleaming gems.

With a kick of his legs, Longbao instantly materialized before a golden gem, snatching it while muttering, “Mine! All mine! Hehe!”

The Red-Cloaked Woman furrowed her brows, confusion flickering across her face. Longbao’s speed had been astonishing—she was merely at the Bone-Refining Initial Stage, and though she’d underestimated him, his speed had left her baffled.

“Little bastard! Daring to rob in Lishui City? You’re seeking death!” A burly man strode from the shadows, his face flushed with anger at the shattered door.

“Apologies! Apologies! We’ll take everything—this door’s compensation too!” Wu Di emerged from the doorway, panting, wiping sweat from his brow as Luo Tian followed, his face etched with a bitter smile.

“Are you their parents?” The burly man’s expression darkened, addressing Luo Tian and Wu Di.

Luo Tian’s condition had slightly improved since the Nirvana Dragon Seal reactivated, his complexion now resembling a normal person’s. Knowing he was at fault, he offered a wry smile, summoning a pile of Qi Stones before the man: “My apologies, sir. Is this enough?”

“Sss….” The crowd inhaled sharply, astonishment on their faces as they gazed at the scattered Qi Stones. Their minds raced—whom did this Luo Tian belong to?

“Miss, do you know this country bumpkin? How could he be so wealthy?” The maid turned to her mistress.

“Don’t know him. Honestly, a youth so lavish with Qi Stones should be familiar to me. I’ve heard nothing of him in the other cities—could he be a disciple of some major sect?” The Red-Cloaked Woman’s face mirrored surprise, murmuring.

“Enough! Enough!” The burly man stared in awe at the Qi Stones, his face aglow as he regarded Luo Tian like a deity.

Seeing the man’s agreement, Wu Di instinctively retrieved his storage pouch, scooping up the items with a苦笑. He fastened it around Longbao’s waist, sighing inwardly at Luo Tian’s wealth.

This journey had him tallying in his mind: Luo Tian had spent at least millions of Qi Stones in this brief time. Gazing at Longbao’s overflowing storage pouches, he wondered what lay within.

The burly man who’d emerged from the shadows smiled ingratiatingly, calling to his staff: “Fetch tea! Let this guest take as much as they wish. Let them stay as long as they like!”

Luo Tian smiled, declining no thanks—this was merely a common jewelry shop. The Qi Stones he’d produced could easily buy it out.

Wu Di exhaled lightly; Longbao’s antics had taxed even his modest Refining Body Level Five.

Luo Tian sipped tea, a gentle smile on his face as he watched Longbao greedily collect gems. The boy’s other hand held not a sugar stick but pills he’d begged for, crunching them with relish.

Everyone in the shop watched the endearing boy drool, gathering gems of every hue.

The Red-Cloaked Woman and her maid refrained from interrupting Longbao, but when the woman noticed him crunching a pill, her face flickered with surprise: “Third-Rank Pills?”

“Huh?” Hearing the woman’s astonishment, Luo Tian turned his gaze toward her.

Chapter 314: Pursuit ()

Chapter 314: Pursuit

Luo Tian’s gaze fell upon the Red-Cloaked Woman, a barely perceptible flicker in his eyes.

His spiritual sense detected her as Bone-Refining Initial Stage—surprise flickered across his face. A youth so young at this stage was rare.

Noting Luo Tian’s surprise, the woman’s expression turned proud. She stepped forward, asking, “Sir, is this your first time in Lishui City?”

Luo Tian bore injuries, his aura subdued. To her, he seemed lowly, mistaking him for Longbao’s attendant.

Though his tone was softened, it carried an air of superiority. Had she not been intrigued by Longbao, she wouldn’t have spoken to this attendant.

“Yes, it is.” Though aware of her potential significance, Luo Tian detected the condescension in her words—a pride ingrained in her bones.

He’d encountered this before: figures like Ying Hongtu, Wang Suyuan, Tu Yuengzheng, even Leng Qiuchan. Yet this woman’s arrogance was more intense.

But Luo Tian, new to Lishui City, hesitated to be overtly cold, merely answering flatly.

“Then, sir, could you tell me where this child hails from? I’ve never heard of him.” The woman’s smile returned, her voice soft.

“Sorry, I can’t disclose that.” Luo Tian remained seated, his body unmoving as he replied flatly.

The woman’s brows furrowed; she disliked this attendant’s insolence.

The maid overheard their exchange, understanding her mistress’s pride but unable to speak out.

At that moment, she realized the problem was Luo Tian’s attitude—yet she’d absorbed her mistress’s arrogance over years.

“Stand up and speak! Do you know who you’re addressing?” The maid coldly demanded.

“This, I don’t know.” Luo Tian smiled faintly, though it was cold. He sipped tea, answering.

“You!” The maid seemed provoked; she’d never met someone who disregarded her mistress so openly, especially an attendant. Others in the city greeted her mistress with smiles, not mentioning her strength but her beauty, renowned across cities.

Tension thickened in the small jewelry shop. The crowd gaped at Luo Tian, calm and sipping tea, speculating who he was—a mere attendant daring to defy the city lord’s daughter.

“Brother! Is it about time? Let’s go!” As the tension rose, Longbao looked eager, his face full of satisfaction as he clutched his storage pouch. Entering the Nirvana Dragon Seal, he couldn’t carry it in.

“Keep it safe! Next time I come out, I’ll play again!” Longbao innocently told Luo Tian.

Luo Tian calculated the time, nodding slowly. He retrieved the pouch, saying to the Red-Cloaked Woman: “My apologies, we must depart.”

Without waiting for her reaction, he led Longbao out.

“Wait!” The woman called, but soon despaired—Luo Tian and Longbao ignored her, striding away.

“Bastard! Daring to ignore me!” The woman glared as their figures merged into the crowd, her face darkening.

“Find them! I’ll see who they are—daring to insult me in Lishui City!” The woman hissed at her maid.

“Understood.” The maid nodded, a curious glint in her eye. This was the first time her mistress had stopped a man; he’d been indifferent, and as an attendant, she guessed if not for the boy, her mistress would’ve already stopped him.

The maid, at Refining Body Level Eight, nodded and hurried after Luo Tian’s disappearing form.

Blending into the crowd, Luo Tian smiled. His spiritual sense now matched the Yuanling Initial Stage, reaching the Xianxu realm. At such proximity, he knew the maid was trailing them.

His lips curled slightly; he led Longbao and Wu Di into an empty alley, leaning against a wall.

“What’s wrong?” Longbao asked.

“An guest will arrive soon. Longbao, rely on you! Brother can’t fight anyone now!” Luo Tian patted Longbao’s head, sighing.

Hearing this, Longbao’s face glowed with a golden light, his small mouth stretching into two teeth. He smiled: “Don’t worry, Brother! Longbao will protect you!”

“Here they come. Subdue her quickly—don’t kill her.” Luo Tian smiled, his spiritual sense revealing a figure at the alley’s entrance.

The maid cautiously peeked out, but as her head emerged, she met a pair of innocent big eyes—nearly shouting in surprise.

Yet seeing it was just the child, she smiled and reached to pat his head—only to hear a voice that made her lips twitch.

“Still female? And so weak! Boring.” Longbao pouted, his face full of disdain.

The maid’s hand hovered mid-air, her smile frozen. “What do you mean ‘still female’ and ‘so weak’? I’m stronger than your two attendants!”

But she had no chance to speak. A plump little fist struck her chest, knocking her back.

“Pfu…” The maid gaped, disbelief on her face as she spat blood, flying backward.

As she landed, a tiny figure blocked the sunlight, repeatedly plopping onto her face.

Chapter 315: Search ()

Chapter 315: Search

Longbao’s move was beyond the maid’s capacity. Even a Bone-Refining Intermediate Puppet would’ve been crushed. If not for Longbao’s restraint, she’d have died instantly.

“Pfu…” A clear odd sound echoed, making Luo Tian and Wu Di exchange glances.

“Ah… I ate too much sugar. Smells… smelly…” Longbao covered his nose, then sat heavily on the maid’s face again.

The maid heard this sound, her pale face turning pork-red. Her face was now facing the small bottom—the source of the sound. She felt a hot breath on her face, nearly fainting.

But that bottom gave no more chances, sitting down again and knocking the maid out.

As the maid closed her eyes, golden light flared—Longbao transformed into a golden dragon, landing on Luo Tian’s back.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian exhaled, leading Wu Di away with a bitter smile. He could imagine the maid’s fury upon waking.

Luo Tian didn’t rush to the city lord’s mansion; instead, he found an unassuming inn to rest, intending to recover before revealing himself. If anything changed at the city lord’s mansion, he’d be prepared.

Three Nirvana Dragon Seals were now fully activated; to activate more, he’d have to wait five days. Thus, he decided to close himself off for five days before visiting the city lord’s mansion to investigate the sects’ whereabouts.

He handed Wu Di some pills and a high-grade Yellow-ranked longsword, then entered his self-cultivation mode in the inn.

Wu Di did the same; with Luo Tian’s pills and the richer spiritual energy here than in Beichang County, he planned to push his Refining Body Level Six during this time.

As Luo Tian and Wu Di closed themselves off, the maid in the alley awoke, confusion on her face. She wiped blood from her lips, recalling something—her expression darkened. Her white fists slammed the alley wall, which crumbled.

“Ah… I’ll kill you!” The maid raged toward the city lord’s mansion.

Back at the city lord’s mansion, she recounted her ordeal to her mistress, omitting the part where Longbao had knocked her out—it was too humiliating. Yet she exaggerated her suffering, crying about the wrongs done to her.

The Red-Cloaked Woman, already favoring her maid, couldn’t bear it. To her, Luo Tian and Longbao were no better than lewd men. She immediately ordered a city-wide search for Luo Tian.

On the first day of Luo Tian’s self-cultivation, countless Refining Body-level soldiers plastered Luo Tian and Wu Di’s images across Lishui City, offering rewards for their capture.

On the second and third days, soldiers scattered across the city to find Luo Tian’s traces.

By the fourth day, still no sign of Luo Tian, deepening the Red-Cloaked Woman’s frenzy. She ordered house-to-house searches.

Time passed slowly; the city lord’s forces easily found one person in Lishui City—had it not been for the inn’s unassuming nature and its elderly owner, they might’ve discovered Luo Tian on day one.

On the fifth day, the old man was tallying accounts at the counter, his white beard marking his age. Yet his abacus clacked rapidly in his hands.

“Clack…” The old man’s aged hand smacked the head of a young apprentice, shouting: “You little bastard! How come this tea’s cost wasn’t accounted for?”

“Ah…” The apprentice, stunned by the old man’s slap, wore a bitter smile, trying to explain.

“Smack…” Before he could speak, the door was kicked open—soldiers flooded in, faces filled with killing intent. All were Refining Body Level Seven, about a dozen men, fanning out on both sides.

A young Red-Cloaked Woman stepped in, her face dark as she followed a maid who gritted her teeth.

“Are you sure it’s here?” The Red-Cloaked Woman asked a soldier.

“The man, Wang Liu, confirmed it!” The soldier nodded fervently, patting his chest.

Feeling her mistress doubted, he barked at the apprentice behind the counter: “Wang Liu, did you say two people matching the image stayed here?”

“Ah…” The apprentice’s face darkened, glancing at the old shopkeeper still abacus-clacking. His expression was conflicted.

“Yes, yes!” The apprentice dared not offend her mistress, answering honestly.

“Alright, you’re dismissed. Go claim your reward. You, tell me which room he’s in!” The Red-Cloaked Woman remained calm, addressing the apprentice.

“In… in the third and fourth rooms upstairs…” Wang Liu trembled under her cold gaze, stammering.

“Good! Here’s compensation for the room fee. There’ll be more later!” The Red-Cloaked Woman tossed a few Qi Stones onto the counter.

Without looking at the old man or apprentice, she led her maid up the stairs.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian exhaled, a smile on his face—five days had passed. His injuries were fully healed, and the Nirvana Dragon Seal was nearing its third activation in a month.

Yet his ears twitched, a smile spreading across his face. His eyes turned to the door, slowly standing up with a crisp sound.

“Unexpectedly fast—your search speed is quite good!” Luo Tian stepped to the door, slowly opening it to reveal a delicate face.

The Red-Cloaked Woman and her maid had just reached the third room when she tried to open it, only for the door to open from within.

Surprised, she saw Luo Tian opening it. Their eyes met; the woman’s face turned cold.

But sensing Luo Tian’s strength and aura, she felt it had grown significantly compared to five days ago.

“Get out!” The maid, seeing Luo Tian, was filled with fury, shouting.

Chapter 316: Escalation ()

Chapter 316: Escalation

Hearing the maid’s shout, Luo Tian smiled gently, asking, “Mistress, may I inquire as to your purpose?”

“Purpose? To kill you!” The maid’s face was frenzied, recalling the humiliation in the alley.

Wu Di, in another room, opened his eyes suddenly, a bitter smile on his face. He felt the past few days with Luo Tian had been too intense—every day was tense, yet he strangely enjoyed it.

As the maid’s shouting echoed, other guests in the inn emerged confusedly from their rooms, faces puzzled.

“What’s all this noise? Let me sleep!” A long-faced man shouted, opening his door.

“Get out!” The maid punched the door from which the voice came, her eyes burning with fury. With a crash, the wooden door was shattered.

“Ah, it’s Lady Ding! Continue!” The long-faced man instantly sobered, recognizing her. His face showed fear.

The middle-aged man cursed his bad luck today; other guests also wore confusion, unaware the city lord’s daughter had come to this unassuming inn.

Under everyone’s astonished gaze, the maid coldly stared at Luo Tian: “Hand over your master. This isn’t your business—leave!”

“Apologies, he’s not eager to meet you. However, if you do meet him, I’m sure you’ll regret your words!” Luo Tian remained calm.

“Then let you regret it!” The maid’s face flashed anger, her white fists glowing faintly blue. She lunged at Luo Tian.

The maid knew Luo Tian was a cultivator, so she used more strength than before—nearly eight-tenths of her power.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, his face cold as he glanced at the Red-Cloaked Woman. His palm met the maid’s fist.

“Boom…” A沉闷 sound formed between them, invisible waves blowing others’ clothes.

The Red-Cloaked Woman’s face flickered with surprise; that glance from Luo Tian had unsettled her, as if a snake had stared at her.

Yet seeing Luo Tian was merely Refining Body Level Nine, with a single golden element body type, she felt reassured. She sighed inwardly at her overreaction.

“Let go of me!” The maid cried, her face dark as she saw Luo Tian’s slight smile.

“Why?”

Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, his voice like a cold wind from the nine hells, clamping the maid’s fist tightly.

Luo Tian was angry—earlier, the maid had unjustly lashed out at the long-faced man, which had annoyed him. But now, she’d attacked without warning, and if he were in his previous state, he wouldn’t have survived this punch.

“Let her go. Kneel and apologize; this will end. Otherwise, you won’t leave Lishui City!” The Red-Cloaked Woman’s voice was cold, her words like charity.

“Why?” Luo Tian remained emotionless; he’d met many like this. If they overstepped, he wouldn’t hesitate to teach them a lesson—thinking themselves superior because of their young age and Bone-Refining Initial Stage, plus good lineage.

“Because I’m at Bone-Refining Initial Stage! And you’re at Refining Body Level Nine!” The Red-Cloaked Woman’s face bore endless arrogance, her Bone-Refining Initial Stage aura spreading like waves.

“Because I’m Ding Xiaoyan! The city lord’s daughter! With my command, half the city’s population would stop you from leaving!” The Red-Cloaked Woman didn’t let Luo Tian speak, revealing her identity.

“The city lord’s daughter?” Luo Tian slowly released the maid, throwing her aside, his face puzzled.

Not that he feared Ding Xiaoyan, but Ding Hongfei had said his junior was the city lord. If he clashed with her daughter, it would be awkward. Logically, Ding Hongfei had done him a favor; this Ding Xiaoyan was also his junior.

But Luo Tian’s release seemed to the Red-Cloaked Woman as submission to her aura and lineage.

“Forgive my earlier disrespect,” Luo Tian bowed, a kind smile on his face.

“Hmph!” The Red-Cloaked Woman snorted, seeing Luo Tian’s smile as submission. This kind of person she’d met before—many self-important fools who, when she was shopping, didn’t recognize her and acted improperly. After revealing her cultivation and lineage, they’d all left with apologies.

“Huh?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed; his face darkened. He’d shown goodwill, yet she demanded he kneel. How could he?

“Kneel or die!” The maid, thrown aside, hearing Luo Tian hesitate, shouted and attacked again.

“Boom…” The maid came fast but left faster—before reaching Luo Tian, she was annoyed by the master and servant and kicked her away.

“Pfu…” The maid gaped, spitting blood from her lips as she flew back.

Most guests in the inn were stunned, thinking they were dreaming—how could someone dare defy Ding Xiaoyan in Lishui City?

“You’re seeking death!” The Red-Cloaked Woman glared at the maid spitting blood, her face furious. Her figure flashed like a red flame, appearing before Luo Tian.

“Don’t take it for granted! I don’t care about your Bone-Refining Initial Stage or this city lord’s daughter!” Luo Tian’s face flashed coldness; his anger had been successfully provoked by Ding Xiaoyan.

Golden light flickered on his fists; Luo Tian, like a golden meteor, took two steps forward, his face showing battle intent.

People trembled; most in the inn were ordinary people—none could withstand their aura, fear rising.

Just as they collided, a aged voice rang out: “Stop! Fight outside!”

Chapter 317: The City Lord ()

Chapter 317: The City Lord

Hearing the aged voice, Luo Tian and Ding Xiaoyan were stunned. Their fists, about to collide, halted—no, it wasn’t their own restraint but a powerful pressure in the narrow space, forcing their spiritual energy back.

“Who!” Luo Tian’s face bore intense caution; he couldn’t fathom who had such cultivation. This pressure was beyond Yuanling Stage.

But Ding Xiaoyan, accustomed to arrogance, sneered. She knew the Ding family had an Yuanling Stage master—otherwise, they wouldn’t hold the city lord position.

“Fooling around! This Lishui City is all my family’s; I rule it!” She slapped her jade token, imprinting spiritual energy onto it.

“I’ll see who it is!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, her red spiritual energy now mixed with blue. Her face bore endless arrogance.

“Water and fire dual-element body?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, inwardly sighing. This Ding Xiaoyan wasn’t entirely useless—being able to coexist with two elements was rare. He’d heard Feng Qianyu say how difficult it was to have dual-element bodies.

Ding Xiaoyan ignored Luo Tian’s thoughts, her red dress swirling as she glared at the fallen maid. Her jade foot stepped down, wooden floor scorching, leaving a trail of footprints toward Luo Tian. Her white fist, brimming with terrifying attack, rushed toward his chest.

“Idiot!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, a mocking smile: “I thought you were a genius for coexisting two elements. But you’re so idiotic!”

Luo Tian sneered, not even bothering to block. He raised his hands, stood on tiptoe, and gazed mockingly as the fist approached his chest.

“Is this kid crazy?” People wondered, sensing the wild energy in Ding Xiaoyan’s fist. If they were hit, they’d die instantly—no remains left. Even this second floor would be affected. They shouted and fled downstairs.

“Hmph…” As people had halfway escaped, Ding Xiaoyan’s fist was about to strike Luo Tian’s chest. A cold sneer echoed in their ears.

The fleeing people stopped, and they witnessed an unbelievable sight: Ding Xiaoyan had mysteriously flown backward.

“Is this youth a ghost? Can he reflect my attack?” The middle-aged man who’d seen Ding Xiaoyan and the maid knocked out stared, surprised at Luo Tian.

Wu Di, who had stood before Luo Tian, also wore disbelief—just now he’d felt the fist’s terror and knew it was beyond his capacity.

Ding Xiaoyan’s face showed intense disbelief, blood flowing from her lips as she shouted: “Who are you! My father is the city lord; dare you injure me?”

This was her first time being insulted so severely—she hadn’t even seen who attacked, and she’d flown back. Especially seeing Luo Tian’s mocking gaze, Ding Xiaoyan grew more frenzied, shouting at all around.

“Go! I won’t计较 this. Also, you must compensate for breaking the shop!” The aged voice rang out, leaving everyone stunned.

“Don’t appear; today I won’t leave. I didn’t know this Lishui City had such a presence, Xiang’er, book me a room. No—book the whole inn!” Ding Xiaoyan, being a genius, thought quickly and devised a plan.

“Girl, don’t test my patience!” The aged voice rang again.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, extending his spiritual sense to scan within several miles. Every plant and tree was in his mind.

“Kid, you’re good—but a bit arrogant!” The voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Boom…” Luo Tian was stunned, his chest aching, disbelief on his face. He hadn’t expected the person to detect his spiritual sense—his lips spat blood.

Luo Tian had overestimated this person, but now he realized he’d miscalculated. This person was definitely a world-class powerhouse—hidden here, and apparently with a good temper.

“If you don’t leave soon, I’ll personally send you out! Then it’s your shame, not mine!” The old man’s voice rang again.

“Hmph! I’m staying in the inn—this is natural. What’s it to you?” Ding Xiaoyan’s face showed a flicker of anxiety, clearly caring about her reputation. If she were sent out, today would be a disgrace.

“Three breaths—leave or I’ll throw you out!” The old man had lost patience, speaking.

“I….” Ding Xiaoyan stood there, her face conflicted.

“Respect the elder! I’ll take my daughter out. From now on, we won’t disturb your peace!” As Ding Xiaoyan hesitated, a cheerful voice echoed from downstairs. People could clearly hear tension in it.

Luo Tian’s voice turned solemn: “Bone-Refining Peak?”

“Father?” Hearing this, Ding Xiaoyan’s face lit up with joy. She saw a middle-aged man in light blue robes striding down the stairs.

“Have you no face to call me father? All you do is cause trouble!” The man’s face was stern, looking at Ding Xiaoyan.

“But he insulted me first!” Ding Xiaoyan’s lips still had blood, her face pale.

“Who dares insult you in this Lishui City?” The man’s face showed anger, disbelieving her.

“It was him! He injured me and Ding Xiang!” Ding Xiaoyan, knowing her father’s nature, wore a pitiful expression, pleading.

“Nonsense! You dare cause trouble here? Apologize to the elder!” The man’s face was furious. He knew the elder’s strength—just a breath, and he’d be dead. If not for the elder’s good temper, he wouldn’t have survived to this day, and Lishui City would never exist under the Ding family.

Chapter 318: Sky-Splitting Spear ()

Chapter 318: Sky-Splitting Spear

“I don’t care! I was insulted by this kid—make him pay!” Ding Xiaoyan spoiled, even making Luo Tian admire her. Wu Di had already drooled.

“Enough! Let’s talk outside; we’re disturbing the elder. Everyone would suffer!” The man’s face showed respect, clearly valuing the elder highly.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly—this Eastern Region was indeed full of talents; even an inn could hide a terrifying powerhouse.

“Elder, this kid has some grudge with my family. Please grant me a small favor to take him away!” The man’s eyes showed respect, bowing to the void.

“Impossible! He’s my guest; if he stays here, I must protect his safety. If he leaves, you can do as you wish. But if he stays even a breath here, I’ll be responsible for his safety—this is my principle!” The aged voice echoed in everyone’s minds.

“Hmph…” Ding Yanshan’s face showed hesitation, turning to Luo Tian.
