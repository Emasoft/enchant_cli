Luo Tian had once possessed Zhongli Tian's body, fully aware of the power of a perfected Reincarnation Body. Yet that fleeting glimpse of a figure left Luo Tian with an overwhelming sense of dread, for this silhouette was far more terrifying than any he had seen before from Zhongli Tian's flesh.

"Tu Feiyang knows this place. That king is likely the former ruler of the Blood Clan, the Blood Lord!" Luo Tian's mind raced with exhilaration and unease. His suspicions were confirmed, yet a deep sense of peril gnawed at him.

"Correct! There's no mistake. I've heard the Blood Clan excels in cultivating corpses. This white-haired corpse must be the work of the Blood Lord!" Luo Tian felt his entire being tremble. How could a human have wandered into a palace entwined with the fate of an ancient royal clan, and worse still, its heir was within?

"Come forth! I shall grant you a celestial transformation and an unparalleled inheritance!" As Luo Tian pondered, a deep voice echoed within his mind.

The voice was ancient and weathered, stirring fresh doubts in Luo Tian's heart. "Is the Blood Lord still alive? Impossible!"

Though Epoch Lords possessed immense power, their ultimate fates remained obscure. Some claimed they ascended to immortality, others that they turned to ash. Yet none had returned after two epochs.

Luo Tian's gaze flickered as he stared at the vast altar. "Luo Tian!" A startled voice shattered the silence, making Luo Tian whirl around to see Tu Feiyang's bewildered expression.

Tu Feiyang gaped at Luo Tian, stunned. He had never expected to find him here—this was the Blood Lord's palace, accessible only with the blood of his clan.

"Fortuitous!" Luo Tian smiled faintly, greeting Tu Feiyang. Though stunned, Luo Tian felt no surprise—only that he had encountered Tu Feiyang sooner than expected.

"Again you! Again you! Last time, you vied for the Elixir of Immortality Scripture. Now you seek my Blood Clan's inheritance!" Tu Feiyang's face twisted with madness, his voice a snarl.

"I don't seek it. But I must stop you!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, his gaze locking onto Tu Feiyang's frenzied expression.

"Stop me? You think you can?" Tu Feiyang roared, realization dawning. "This is the Blood Lord's royal chamber! Do you think you can outmatch me?"

"Kill him!" Tu Feiyang pointed, barking orders. As his words echoed, Luo Tian finally noticed a green-haired corpse trailing Tu Feiyang—its cultivation level merely Epoch Initial.

"This is the Blood Lord's personally cultivated corpse. Though only at Epoch Initial, its flesh is formidable. You claim your body is strong—play with it!" Tu Feiyang's voice cracked with mania.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian grimaced at the green-haired corpse, surprised Tu Feiyang knew how to control corpses. Yet he soon noticed the ghostly face mark on Tu Feiyang's arm.

"Indeed, it relates to this mark!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with understanding. He smiled.

As Luo Tian marveled, the green-haired corpse shot forward as a streak of green light. A putrid scent filled his nose, making him frown.

A massive hand of emerald fur lunged at Luo Tian. He could see the black nails slicing through space.

Luo Tian felt revulsion, summoning a surge of energy to evade the attack. He sighed inwardly—this white-haired corpse was far more endearing than this one, though it had initially stank.

"Tu Feiyang! If you wish to fight, I shall meet your challenge. Today I'll see what new skills you've acquired!" Luo Tian retreated, raising a hand. A white lightning bolt descended, chilling the blood-drenched space.

The white-haired corpse's eyes flashed red before going vacant, standing motionless in the crimson void.

"A perfected Corpse King of Epoch Mid!" Tu Feiyang's face paled upon seeing the white-haired corpse.

"Kill him!" Luo Tian's expression turned icy, commanding his Epoch Book to issue orders to the white-haired corpse.

The ghostly face mark on the Epoch Book pulsed, sending waves of invisible energy into the white-haired corpse's withered body.

"Roar..." The white-haired corpse's eyes blazed, lunging at the green-haired corpse.

"Boom!" The collision of two corpses sent Tu Feiyang's lips twitching in disbelief.

"Damn you! I'll kill you!" Tu Feiyang seethed, transforming into a streak of blood to charge Luo Tian.

"Desired!" Luo Tian's battle spirit surged. He longed to test his strength at Epoch Initial against this opponent, and had already resolved to end Tu Feiyang's life here. His luck was too good—first the Elixir of Immortality Scripture, now the Blood Lord's inheritance. Without him, these superlative inheritances would have surely fallen to Tu Feiyang.

Chapter 1274: The Misfortune of Tu Feiyang

Within the blood-drenched space, Luo Tian's form moved like lightning, ascending to Epoch Initial. His body's strength surged again, his flight producing thunderous cracks as he materialized before Tu Feiyang.

"Blood Demon's Chant!" Tu Feiyang's eyes darkened, spitting blood that formed into crimson seals. The power of the Dao surged as he punched toward Luo Tian.

"Boom!" Their fists collided, sending Tu Feiyang flying back with a burst of blood. His entire arm exploded in a shower of crimson, his face pale.

At Epoch Mid, Luo Tian's body alone could match Tu Feiyang in close combat. Now at Epoch Initial, even with his secret techniques, Tu Feiyang was no match.

"How strong!" Tu Feiyang knew Luo Tian's body was nearly invincible. He retreated, blood swirling as his broken arm regenerated. With a hand gesture, he summoned a crimson blade that expanded into the blood-drenched space.

"Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram!" Luo Tian's palm glowed with holy light, unleashing nine layers of celestial pressure. The overwhelming divine power crushed the crimson blade.

The void thundered as their techniques collided, shaking the heavens. The violent waves annihilated vast swaths of blood energy.

"I won't let you escape!" Tu Feiyang's eyes burned with hatred, spitting another mouthful of blood to form a crimson figure. Luo Tian's expression darkened.

"Blood Demon's Finger!" Tu Feiyang howled, the crimson figure expanding into a spectral form. Its overwhelming aura filled the blood-drenched space, making Luo Tian frown.

"I, Tu Feiyang, was born with celestial signs. I was taken to a realm of an Epoch Peak immortal! After five years, I returned to the Blood Clan. I was undefeated for a generation. Last time you took the Elixir of Immortality Scripture, but I don't care. This Blood Lord's inheritance is mine—no one can take it!"

"This 'Blood Demon's Finger' is a凝聚 of an Epoch Peak immortal's essence. How do you block it?"

Tu Feiyang's crimson hair flowed as he regained confidence, pointing at Luo Tian with hatred.

"Buzz..." The crimson figure mirrored Tu Feiyang's movement, striking toward Luo Tian with a thunderous roar.

The crimson finger descended like a mountain, shaking Luo Tian's heart. This Tu Feiyang had hidden depths—Epoch Peak essence was precious, capable of killing an Epoch Initial immortal with a single glance. Whether human or royal clan member, essence was the core of one's bloodline.

"I can intercept you once. I'll do it again. Luo Tian is your eternal curse!" Luo Tian coldly replied, his body radiating white light as he channeled the Epoch's power into a fist. The Dao-Sealing Fist combined with two supreme techniques clashed against the crimson finger.

This punch also burned a drop of blood, its ruthless reincarnation blood rivaling an Epoch Peak's essence.

"Crack..." A streak of crimson lightning surged around Luo Tian. His face was wild, the Epoch power swirling around him as he descended, blood spewing from his mouth and arms riddled with cracks.

"This can still block!" Tu Feiyang's face contorted in shock, seeing Luo Tian spitting blood. The spectral figure shattered.

"I won't let you always block!" Tu Feiyang's eyes gleamed with cold determination. He doubted his speed surpassed Luo Tian's. If he let him close, it would be trouble.

Thinking this, Tu Feiyang slapped his storage pouch. A crimson fan materialized above him.

The fan was composed of crimson feathers, each radiating cold light. A chill ran down Luo Tian's spine.

"Shura Seven Blood Fan!" Tu Feiyang channeled power, the fan sweeping violently. A storm of wind surged toward Luo Tian.

"Still not done!" Tu Feiyang unleashed his full strength, the fan disintegrating into countless sharp arrows that shot toward Luo Tian.

"Indeed formidable. A precious treasure, I accept it!" Luo Tian marveled at Tu Feiyang's endless techniques. Yet he showed no fear, only a smile as the arrows aimed to wound him.

"Trouble!" Tu Feiyang's heart tightened upon seeing Luo Tian's smile. He recalled how Luo Tian had withstood four supreme treasures in the Heavenly Tempest.

The next moment, Tu Feiyang's heart trembled. Luo Tian extended his white hand, fingers slightly curled.

"Again this trick!" Tu Feiyang's heart ached. His deadly technique would have crippled any prodigy, but it failed against Luo Tian.

"Eight Directions' Treasure Retrieval Technique!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his palm pressing into the void.

The seven arrows froze instantly. The violent storm also halted abruptly, as if time had stopped.

"Return!" Luo Tian roared, his voice carrying authority. The crimson arrows echoed as they reversed direction, rushing toward Tu Feiyang with the storm.

Tu Feiyang's eyes widened. In the Tian Du Mountains, Luo Tian had only stopped four treasures but hadn't made them turn on him. Now the crimson arrows were attacking him.

"Damn!" Tu Feiyang was stunned as the storm and arrows struck his body.

"Endless Blood Pool!" Tu Feiyang howled, his form engulfed by the storm. Yet he transformed into blood, shattering and scattering across space. The storm calmed as he regenerated, his power undiminished.

"Resourceful techniques indeed!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with admiration. He finally felt Tu Feiyang's threat, his endless strategies making him uneasy.

Yet Luo Tian still moved swiftly. As Tu Feiyang reformed, he lunged forward and punched.

"You can't kill me!" Tu Feiyang sneered, transforming into blood mist and fleeing toward the ancient crimson altar.

"Where do you think you're going?" Luo Tian's eyes turned cold, his speed reaching its peak as he chased Tu Feiyang.

Tu Feiyang's face twisted with madness. As they collided repeatedly, though Tu Feiyang was at a disadvantage in close combat, his Endless Blood Pool technique kept him unharmed.

The thunderous clash echoed between them. As they neared the ancient altar shrouded in blood mist, Luo Tian felt an ominous premonition.

"Tu Feiyang, this altar isn't simple!" Luo Tian punched into the blood mist while shouting.

"You're afraid! You fear I'll obtain the Blood Lord's inheritance and kill you!" Tu Feiyang's voice echoed with arrogance.

"No matter what! I'll obtain this inheritance today!" Tu Feiyang's voice was wild. The inheritance of an Epoch Lord was too tempting for anyone to resist.

"Boom..." Tu Feiyang's body showed no hesitation, crashing into the ancient altar. The collision sent ripples through the thick blood mist, emitting mournful cries as if countless souls howled.

"My descendants! Open this altar and release my残魂. I shall grant you an unparalleled inheritance, the highest honor of the Blood Clan!" A deep voice with seductive undertones rose from the blood mist, intensifying Luo Tian's ominous premonition.

"It's my ancestor's残魂. Ha! My royal clan's king, though only a残魂, one finger could crush you!" Tu Feiyang laughed wildly, his blood body undeterred. He dodged Luo Tian's attack and charged toward the crimson altar.

The collision sent cracks across the altar, darkening Luo Tian's expression.

"Stop!" A furious roar echoed as a golden foot rose from Luo Tian's feet—The First Step of the蛮 Seven Stomp, "The Godly One's Anger Stomps Nine Heavens."

"No use!" Tu Feiyang's eyes burned with madness. His sanity seemed corrupted, his body emitting thunderous sounds as he sacrificed his essence to collapse space and collide with the altar.

"Boom..." The golden foot struck Tu Feiyang's body. At the same time, the crimson altar shattered.

Chapter 1275: The Blood Lord's Malice

"Boom..." The explosion echoed. Luo Tian's foot pressed onto Tu Feiyang's body, and Tu Feiyang's sacrifice finally shattered the crimson altar. Yet his price was immediate—his body turned into a mist of blood, merging with the altar's explosive blood mist. The two could not coalesce for a long time.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's face darkened. He stared at the surging blood mist, his eyes filled with intense fear. He retreated, waiting for events to unfold. He knew the altar was destroyed and beyond his control. The techniques of an Epoch Lord were too much for him to handle. He wanted to escape but couldn't find an exit.

The mist hummed, gradually coalescing into a towering figure. An overwhelming aura descended upon Luo Tian's body.

"Could the Blood Lord truly still be alive?" Luo Tian trembled, watching the figure form.

Tu Feiyang's pale face appeared in Luo Tian's vision, his eyes filled with wild fervor. He looked at the slowly forming blood shadow before turning to Luo Tian.

"Haha! I've revived my Blood Clan's king. This is a monumental event! My Blood Clan's king still lives in this world!" Tu Feiyang shouted, kneeling before the blood shadow.

Under Luo Tian and Tu Feiyang's gaze, the blood shadow finally coalesced. A supreme aura surged skyward—distinctly that of a royal clan's king.

The blood eyes slowly opened, like the eyes of creation. One could not help but kneel before them. The gaze swept over Tu Feiyang, who knelt, then landed on Luo Tian.

"Truly alive! How is this possible? This Blood Lord is from an age long past, even older than the human race's Tianzhi and Duantian masters. How could he appear here!" Luo Tian was stunned, his eyes wide with disbelief. His heart trembled as he gazed at the blood shadow—though faint, it was terrifying.

"Something's wrong!" Suddenly, Luo Tian realized the blood shadow's aura was weaker than what he had seen before with Miaoyin and Meng Lingyun.

"A low growl echoed from the blood shadow. Its red eyes focused on Luo Tian.

"Something's off!" Luo Tian retreated again, sensing boundless evil in those blood eyes.

"You bastard! Tu Feiyang, you fool! This isn't your Blood Clan's Blood Lord!" Luo Tian roared. Though he didn't want to warn Tu Feiyang, he knew if Tu Feiyang died, he would have no chance against this terrifying entity.

"You're...!" Tu Feiyang's eyes flashed with disdain, shouting at Luo Tian. But before he could finish, his gaze met the blood shadow. His body shivered, a cold wave sweeping over him.

The next moment, the blood shadow made no sound. It formed a massive hand of blood and slammed toward Tu Feiyang.

The strike carried overwhelming power. The entire blood-drenched space trembled, sending Tu Feiyang into a frenzy. He fled toward Luo Tian's direction.

"Why do I sense such evil? This isn't my Blood Clan's king!" Tu Feiyang was bewildered. He felt an unbearable pressure whenever he touched Luo Tian, as if his luck had vanished.

Tu Feiyang knew the Blood Clan's king was ruthless but would never possess such evil aura.

The thunderous sound echoed. Tu Feiyang, in a desperate flight, evaded the blood hand's suppression and appeared ten thousand feet away. His eyes reflected disbelief.

"Useless! You're a failure!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. In that brief eye contact with the shadow, he felt its greed—viewing him like a prey.

"I understand. This is my Blood Clan's evil intent! Trapped by this altar, it grew into this form. Essentially, it is a part of the Blood Lord!" Tu Feiyang finally recalled the records about the Blood Lord, his voice trembling.

"What!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. He knew anything connected to an Epoch Lord was terrifying.

"It has no body. It's after my flesh!" Luo Tian immediately understood the shadow's greed stemmed from his body.

"Epoch Late!" Luo Tian sensed the shadow's strength, shivering. A mere Epoch Late was beyond his ability to fight. And this was the Blood Lord's evil intent, surely stronger than an ordinary Epoch Late. Luo Tian believed even an Epoch Peak immortal would be helpless against this evil.

"You bastard! You're the one who caused this!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with murderous intent. If it weren't for this fool, there would be no such situation.

Blood surged as the blood shadow's aura rose. It extended a phantom hand toward Luo Tian and Tu Feiyang, drawing them involuntarily toward the evil presence.

"You're a descendant of the Blood Lord. Think of a way, you fool!" Luo Tian roared, though he wanted to kill Tu Feiyang, he still addressed him.

"I don't know!" Tu Feiyang nearly cried. He struggled against the terrifying pull, responding loudly.

"Dammit, if you can't think of anything, I'll kill you first!" Luo Tian's body radiated white light. He dodged the pull while moving toward Tu Feiyang, grabbing his neck with a cold gaze.

Tu Feiyang had already been wounded. How could he resist Luo Tian? His face turned red with anger and frustration, spitting blood.

"Don't spit blood! Think fast!" Luo Tian felt their bodies drawing closer to the evil presence. This was a true life-or-death crisis, and he roared.

"Ugh..." Tu Feiyang was desperate. His mind suddenly sparked with inspiration, pointing at the ghostly face mark on his arm.

"Huh?" Luo Tian's expression changed. He released Tu Feiyang, waiting for his explanation.

"This mark is the Blood Lord's seal. Though this evil intent is part of the Blood Lord, it must fear the Blood Lord!" Tu Feiyang spoke, then spat blood over his ghostly face mark.

"Buzz..." The ghostly face mark on Tu Feiyang's arm changed, sometimes weeping, sometimes laughing. Blood mist radiated from it.

Tu Feiyang's face turned pale like a sheet, his body gradually thinning.

Blood mist coalesced and eventually formed a blood figure. Though solemn, its eyes were numb.

At the moment this blood figure appeared, the evil presence trembled. Its red eyes showed fear.

"This is a projection of the Blood Lord, but its strength is weak. I don't know if it can subdue this entity!" Tu Feiyang spoke, kneeling before the blood figure.

"It can't. Once that evil presence recovers, we're still doomed!" Luo Tian observed the projection's strength—though formidable and with supreme aura—it was weaker than the evil presence.

"Come here!" Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing Tu Feiyang and launching the Epoch Book's fragment. He slammed it onto Tu Feiyang's back.

"Spit..." Tu Feiyang coughed blood, spitting it onto the fragment. The blood landed on the ghostly face mark.

At this moment, Tu Feiyang finally noticed the same ghostly face mark on the fragment. His eyes widened in disbelief, but his body trembled immediately.

"Ah..." Tu Feiyang let out a low scream. He realized that after his blood touched the ghostly face mark, his blood was being drained at an alarming speed.

"Luo Tian, you bastard! This ghostly face mark can be activated with the blood of an Epoch Initial!" Tu Feiyang roared, his voice filled with weakness.

"Better you die than waste your blood!" Luo Tian looked at Tu Feiyang like a fool, not forgetting their adversarial relationship.

The buzz returned. A low laugh and weeping echoed in the blood-drenched space, blood mist surging as the ghostly face mark emitted more blood energy. It seemed to awaken something terrifying, and the blood figure finally coalesced with Tu Feiyang's previous spectral form.

"Boom!" The previous blood figure exploded, merging with this tangible one. Blood light flashed, its aura overwhelming—like the Blood Lord's rebirth.

Tu Feiyang looked like a withered corpse, his eyes filled with awe.

"Evil!" A deep voice echoed from the blood figure. Its eyes were solemn, gazing at the evil presence with a command that shook heaven and earth.

Chapter 1276: One Glance Through the Veil

The blood figure stood before Luo Tian and Tu Feiyang, making them feel like they were gazing at a giant. An overwhelming aura of solitude radiated from the figure, its eyes fixed on the evil presence.

The Blood Lord Tu Tian, ruler of the ancient royal clan Blood Clan. Even older than the human race's Duantian Master, he was invincible for two epochs, subduing all ancient clans.

A single rebuke sent a heavenly sound echoing through the space. The evil presence trembled, fear spreading through the blood-drenched void. Even Luo Tian and Tu Feiyang were affected.

Luo Tian quickly released Tu Feiyang. After all, Tu Feiyang was a descendant of Tu Tian's countless generations. If he saw himself almost killed, the Blood Lord's power was terrifying. Though not Tu Tian's true self, as Tu Feiyang said, one finger could crush him.

Fortunately, Tu Tian seemed to ignore Luo Tian and Tu Feiyang. His eyes remained deep as he gazed at the evil presence, his expression solemn.

"Disperse!" Tu Tian spoke again, his voice unyielding. He pointed a finger, and a terrifying wave surged from the Blood Lord's hand. It wasn't Epoch power but stronger than it.

The thunderous collision shook the space, a thick finger crushing the evil presence. The entire blood-drenched void seemed filled with this single finger, time locked and severed.

"I won't submit..." The evil presence's low growl echoed. Its red eyes glowed with fierce determination, though it feared Tu Tian's projection.

"You sought perfection but cut me off. Now I have a chance to revive, why must you subdue me!" The evil presence's eyes showed resolve. It gazed at the crushing finger, roaring defiantly.

"I am you. You are me. You're merely a残念. I am the true Blood Lord. If I can revive, I'll replace you!" The evil presence seemed to understand the truth. Its red eyes glowed brighter, its aura overwhelming and fearless as it punched toward the crushing finger.

This punch carried the evil presence's resentment, anger, and委屈. Blood mist surged as its aura seemed to break through.

The thunderous collision shook the blood-drenched space. Luo Tian and Tu Feiyang, pale-faced, watched two titans clash. The violent waves sent them flying ten thousand miles away before stopping. Their bodies were riddled with cracks, clearly wounded.

Especially the unfortunate Tu Feiyang—after battling Luo Tian and nearly being crushed, he was drained of blood twice by the ghostly face mark. Now, caught in the clash between the Blood Lord's残念 and the evil presence, he almost lost his life.

If not for sensing something wrong and summoning a crimson umbrella to shield himself, Tu Feiyang would have been annihilated. Though the crimson umbrella was destroyed in the process, it saved his life—leaving him barely conscious on the blood-drenched starry space.

"Ah?" Luo Tian's eyes lit up. Though he was also wounded, he was far better off than Tu Feiyang. This was the perfect moment to kill him.

This thought grew stronger, but soon Luo Tian's heart tightened. He felt as if something was watching him. His body instinctively trembled.

A cold aura enveloped Luo Tian's body. A white-haired corpse appeared before him, staring blankly. Its pale lips seemed to chew something, making a crunching sound that sent chills down his spine. The cold aura seeped into Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian had forgotten about the white-haired corpse he summoned during his battle with Tu Feiyang. He hadn't expected it to have already finished the fight—there was no sign of the green-haired corpse Tu Feiyang had brought in.

"Big brother, did you eat that guy?" Luo Tian stared at the white-haired corpse's continuous chewing. His stomach churned.

"Your taste is really heavy!" Luo Tian's lips twitched, especially when he saw the green liquid oozing from the white-haired corpse's mouth. He nearly vomited.

"Something changed!" Luo Tian's mind stirred. He felt the white-haired corpse's withered body had grown slightly plump, and sensed an invisible wave flowing within it.

Though the white-haired corpse seemed vacant, standing before him gave a strong sense of danger. It felt like it would immediately attack Tu Feiyang if he moved, standing before him as a deterrent. This deterrent's source made Luo Tian glance at Tu Tian's battle with the evil presence.

At this thought, Luo Tian dared not move. The white-haired corpse wasn't a problem, but the Blood Lord was something he couldn't ignore. Though Tu Tian seemed indifferent to their lives, he had been observing them.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly but was also relieved. Clearly, for some reason, the Blood Lord didn't want to kill him. Otherwise, one glance or a single point would have been enough for him to perish.

Thinking this, Luo Tian remained still, recovering his wounded body. His gaze turned toward the battle between the Blood Lord and the evil presence.

Though neither was a physical entity, their combat waves were hundreds of times stronger than those of titans at Epoch Initial. If not for the blood-drenched space's extraordinary stability, it would have already collapsed. Remember, an Epoch Lord could slaughter a star domain.

The thunderous collision continued without end. Two spectral figures clashed, their voices echoing with Daoic power. Cracks spread across their bodies as they moved at speeds beyond Luo Tian's comprehension, only hearing the evil presence's roars.

"Truly strong! When will I possess such overwhelming power? Even the Blood Lord's残念 is this powerful. If his true self were here, how strong would he be!" Luo Tian marveled at their dazzling battle. The entire blood-drenched space was annihilated by their attacks.

"By my name, Tu Tian, I shall gather the ancient altar and crush my eternal evil presence!" A deep voice echoed amidst the violent blood mist, a powerful wave representing the will of heaven itself.

"Did he win?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a flicker of joy, but his heart was also tense. He didn't know what awaited him next—whether Tu Tian would crush him with a single finger or let him leave.

At this moment, Luo Tian no longer wanted to stop Tu Feiyang from obtaining the inheritance. He just wished to save his own life, but everything depended on the Blood Lord's mood.

As Tu Tian's projection spoke, the violent blood mist gradually calmed. It transformed into crimson seals, roaring like dragons as they plunged into the blood-drenched mist.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous echoes resounded. A crimson altar materialized before Luo Tian's astonished gaze, emerging from the blood-drenched mist.

"Roar..." A mournful cry echoed from the void, shaking Luo Tian's mind and causing his blood to churn.

"I won't submit!" The evil presence's spectral form was wrapped in crimson seals, struggling endlessly.

Though Tu Tian's projection had dimmed, his face showed authority. His blood hand clutched fiercely.

"Boom!" The crimson seals glowed red, instantly annihilating the evil presence. They scattered into invisible waves across the altar.

"An astonishing technique! An Epoch Late evil presence was killed in such a short time!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. He gazed at the Blood Lord's projection standing proudly, like a mountain that made him look up in awe.

"Is this my descendant?" Tu Tian turned, seeing the fallen Tu Feiyang. His eyes showed a touch of nostalgia.
