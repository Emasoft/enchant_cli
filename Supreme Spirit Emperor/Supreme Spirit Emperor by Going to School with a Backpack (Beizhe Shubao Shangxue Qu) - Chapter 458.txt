“What is this token, that it has caused those two to massacre the Tianyuan Sect!” Luo Tian muttered as he cautiously moved, recalling Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang.

Initially, Luo Tian had believed the two were sent by Zhu Fenghuo, but after witnessing their purpose, he realized his mistake. If Zhu Fenghuo had sent them, their target would have been himself, not the token.

“No matter who you are, you must die!” Luo Tian gradually regained his composure, ceasing to ponder their identities. His crimson eyes slowly returned to calmness as he strode through the damp forest, his gaze deep and resolute.

The forest was eerily silent; Luo Tian could only hear the sound of his footsteps on the ground. The entire forest exuded a chilling aura, devoid of sunlight, making it unnaturally sinister.

“Gurgle… gurgle… gurgle…” The cries of night owls echoed from the forest’s depths, halting Luo Tian. As the sound resonated, he felt a powerful surge approaching him.

“Ugh…” A mournful wail emerged from the forest’s depths, and immediately afterward, a wave of blue light enveloped Luo Tian, causing his heart to race.

“Too fast…” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief; he had barely heard the sound when a group of creatures materialized around him.

“Wolves…” Suddenly, towering wolves radiating cold energy appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, swiftly surrounding him.

Their icy fangs, azure fur, and massive bodies—three to four times larger than ordinary wolves—made Luo Tian draw a sharp breath.

“Howling Moon Heavenly Wolves!” Luo Tian instantly recognized the species, his heart trembling.

Adult Howling Moon Heavenly Wolves possessed strength comparable to a Celestial Daoist, and their ferocity was compounded by their pack nature.

“Such bad luck…” Luo Tian gazed at the dense horde of wolves, fear flickering in his eyes. Though he was a Celestial Daoist, a few of these beasts posed no threat; however, their numbers were endless. If he became trapped, they would devour him completely.

With no hesitation, Luo Tian leapt into the air, aiming to escape their grasp.

“Roar!” Though his speed was swift, the Howling Moon Heavenly Wolves matched it, instantly lunging toward him.

“Return!” Luo Tian barked, but he did not strike them. First, he wished to avoid inciting their ferocity; secondly, due to Long Jie’s influence, he upheld a principle of sparing beasts whenever possible.

A gust of wind formed in Luo Tian’s hands, and several adult Howling Moon Heavenly Wolves were hurled to the ground.

“Roar!” A deep growl echoed through the pack, as if commanded. One by one, the wolves howled, their powerful limbs propelling them toward Luo Tian, who had ascended to a hundred zhang above.

In an instant, the wolves surrounded him again, prompting Luo Tian to furrow his brow.

“I do not kill you, yet you seek my life?” Luo Tian’s face darkened with coldness. He knew these beasts possessed sentience, yet they relentlessly attacked him.

Fueled by anger, Luo Tian’s hand sliced through the air, severing a dozen Howling Moon Wraith Wolves into halves. Blood sprayed across the ground.

“Roar!” A low growl echoed, and as the blue blood rained down, the wolves frenziedly howled at Luo Tian. However, he had already ascended to hundreds of zhang above, beyond their reach.

“No time for games!” Luo Tian sneered, his form flickering as he continued searching for Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang.

With a cold glint in his eyes, Luo Tian soared through the endless Endtimes Forest, scanning for them.

“Ugh…” The wolves’ cries echoed again, but the pack refused to let Luo Tian go. Towering Howling Moon Wolves sprinted through the Endtimes Forest, relentlessly pursuing him in the sky.

“Tiresome!” Luo Tian cursed, pushing his speed to its limit, yet he could not escape the wolves.

He had no clue why his fortune was so dire—just entering the forest and immediately drawing their attention.

As he flew deeper into the Endtimes Forest, faint glimmers appeared in his vision. The glimmers radiated a palpable aura.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian soared toward the light, accompanied by the Howling Moon Wolves. To an outsider, it might seem these wolves were his pets.

Though the light seemed near, Luo Tian flew for nearly a quarter of an hour before discerning what it was.

A barrier—more precisely, a vast one. Suspended within it was a golden altar, and atop the altar floated a golden token.

“Xue Sha… Liang Tian Guang!” Luo Tian’s heart pounded as he saw two figures outside the barrier: one clad in crimson robes, another in earth-yellow. These were the very Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang he sought.

A surge of murderous intent erupted from Luo Tian, and his golden crackling spear materialized in his hand. He闪身 toward them with a burst of speed.

Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang wore expressions of excitement, their gazes fixed on the golden token within the barrier. Before them floated a green token—exactly the unassuming one they had retrieved from Tianyuan Sect’s treasure vault.

Yet, the token etched with a “ghost” character now transformed, as if embedded in the barrier’s exterior. It radiated a steady green glow. The rust on its surface slowly vanished, and a surge of power emanated from it.

“Ghost Valley Seal… truly the Ghost Valley Seal!” Xue Sha’s eyes widened in disbelief, staring at the green token.

“Later generations have not seen Ghost Valley Mountain; the old man calculated everything and became an immortal!” Liang Tian Guang’s eyes also gleamed with excitement, murmuring softly.

“Roar!” As they marveled, a series of howls echoed in their ears. Luo Tian materialized behind them as a streak of light, launching an immediate kill strike without granting them any chance.

“Howling Moon Wolves…” They turned abruptly, only to see the wolves swarming toward them.

Chapter 1778: Ghost Valley Seal

“First, ascend to the sky!” Xue Sha shouted, his crimson form leaping into the air. He slashed with a blood-red blade, its crimson light slicing through several Howling Moon Wolves.

Liang Tian Guang also soared skyward, hurling a meteorite that killed numerous wolves. Both ascended, escaping the wolves’ attack range—yet as they did, Luo Tian’s lethal strike arrived instantly, causing their minds to freeze.

A golden spear materialized behind Xue Sha, and with it came Luo Tian, his eyes blood-red.

“Die!” Xue Sha’s face paled; he had not sensed Luo Tian’s presence before. Now, the threat was undeniable.

Xue Sha, a disciple of the Tianmen Sect, had long handled tasks Zhu Fenghuo could not. Over the years, countless strong individuals had perished at his hands, making him a seasoned warrior.

At the moment the golden spear appeared, Xue Sha instinctively twisted his body to evade the vital area.

“Plop!” The crackling spear pierced Xue Sha’s shoulder, just a few inches from his heart. That margin saved his life.

Though he survived, Xue Sha’s already pale face turned whiter still. A tearing aura erupted from the spear, causing him to stagger violently.

“Luo Tian!” Liang Tian Guang’s face bore shock as he recognized the blood-red figure. He had never expected Luo Tian to find this place.

Liang Tian Guang believed he had thoroughly concealed his presence; even a Celestial Daoist at the middle stage would struggle to locate them.

“Seventy-eight-six brothers of Tianyuan Sect—did they all die by your hands?” Luo Tian stood in the sky, his crackling spear dripping blood.

“Yes… they were just pests!” Liang Tian Guang smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. Though Luo Tian had wounded Xue Sha, he was alone. They were two Celestial Daoists, both at the early stage.

“You are Luo Tian… I never thought you would come here yourself. I intended to eliminate you after advancing to the middle stage. Since you’ve arrived, it’s convenient!” Xue Sha’s face was pale, his body trembling. His shoulder wound ceased bleeding, and sharp auras erupted from his form.

“Kill…” Luo Tian said nothing, launching his spear to unleash a storm of golden light toward them.

Seeing the attack, Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang’s expressions shifted slightly. They闪身 apart.

Xue Sha wielded his crimson blade, slicing repeatedly with blood-red slashes that resembled crescent moons, cutting through Luo Tian’s storm.

Liang Tian Guang waved his hands, illuminating the sky with divine light before merging it into a powerful aura to clash against the golden storm.

“Boom… boom…” The three formidable martial arts clashed, their techniques colliding and annihilating each other.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian ignored the destroyed techniques, his hands moving rapidly. A golden divine map descended like nine heavens, causing Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang to frown in concern.

“This Luo Tian is no ordinary opponent; his techniques are at the high-level Daoist stage!” Liang Tian Guang’s mind sharpened, gazing at the descending nine heavens with surprise.

“Intercepting Heaven’s Seal…” Luo Tian continued striking, each technique he unleashed was formidable.

“How many techniques does he have?” Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang also struck back, but they were astonished by Luo Tian’s multitude of techniques. Each one left them in disarray.

Both had sect backgrounds, giving them numerous strategies, but they were still overwhelmed by Luo Tian’s prowess from the start.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath, Trampling Nine Heavens!” A golden foot descended step by step, pressing down on them and forcing their bodies to sink.

“Roar…” The wolves’ cries echoed, as the ground-bound Howling Moon Wolves howled upon seeing their masters descend. They leaped from the earth, lunging at Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang.

This time, they had no time to deal with the dozen wolves; Luo Tian’s attacks never ceased.

“Crack…” Cold fangs pierced their bodies, making their faces paler still.

“Rip…!” Several Howling Moon Wolves fell from the sky, tearing away large chunks of flesh from Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang.

“Damn it! I’ll fight back!” Xue Sha and Liang Tian Guang’s faces were pale, their frustration evident.

“Buzz…” Xue Sha vanished from Luo Tian’s sight, while Liang Tian Guang ascended again. A divine law erupted from Liang Tian Guang’s body, forming complex symbols that merged into his form.

As he flew, Liang Tian Guang’s injuries healed rapidly, his body glowing with light. He waved his hands, and a massive meteorite plummeted toward Luo Tian.

“Have you recovered?” Luo Tian’s eyes remained blood-red, his divine attack technique activated alongside the King of Kings’ combat method. He clashed with Liang Tian Guang.

“Go down!” Luo Tian roared, throwing a punch that collided with Liang Tian Guang’s.

“Die!” Liang Tian Guang smiled, confident in his physical strength. In their grade, he had never feared anyone—neither the prodigies of his sect nor others. His unique body-refining method had earned him fame within the sect.

“Crack…” Like a thunderclap, their fists met. Liang Tian Guang’s joyous expression instantly changed.

“How is this possible!” Liang Tian Guang gasped, watching his arm crack and his body flying back.

“Boom…” A沉闷 sound echoed as Liang Tian Guang’s body became a streak of light, crashing into the Howling Moon Wolf pack and killing many.

The wolf pack stirred briefly before their碧色 eyes turned to Liang Tian Guang, who had killed their companions. They let out low growls.

Liang Tian Guang rose from the wolf corpses, feeling a chill as he saw their eyes. He shivered.

“Roar…” Before Liang Tian Guang could react, the Howling Moon Wolves lunged at him.

“Damn it!” Liang Tian Guang could not ascend in time, so he gritted his teeth and fought against the wolf pack.

“Buzz…” A wave of energy rose from Luo Tian’s back, causing his neck to feel a chill. He turned abruptly and grabbed the air with his hands.

A blood-red blade appeared in his hand, and Xue Sha’s pale face emerged in Luo Tian’s eyes.

“What? Empty-handed interception of a blade?” Xue Sha’s first thought was this, bewildered by Luo Tian holding his blood sword. He did not know how Luo Tian achieved it.

“Daoist Seal of Demon Subjugation!” However, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, and a golden fist smashed into Xue Sha’s head.

“Plop…” Xue Sha spat blood, feeling as if struck by a hammer. His face twisted in pain.

“This punch is for Da Hu!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, activating the幽冥鬼步 and appearing in front of Xue Sha. He struck again.

“This punch is for Er Niu… this punch is for…” Luo Tian recited names one by one, and a series of punches formed before Xue Sha. Each punch caused him to retreat further.

Xue Sha, caught in Luo Tian’s proximity, had no chance to retaliate; he was pummeled by the relentless punches.

“Give me a swift death!” Xue Sha’s mind roared, but Luo Tian’s punches were precise, not allowing him to die.

“Master, this is a great enemy!” Xue Sha’s mind cried out for Zhu Fenghuo. Luo Tian was terrifying; even with Liang Tian Guang’s help, they were no match for him.

“This punch is for me!” Luo Tian roared and finally shattered Xue Sha’s body, who wore an expression of relief at death.

“Do you think this is over?” Luo Tian gazed at the swirling blood mist, his face cruel. He extended his hand to grasp it.

“Condense Soul!” An invisible wave emanated from Luo Tian’s hands, affecting the blood mist. A stream of gray gas emerged and coalesced into Xue Sha’s form.

“Sizzle…” Seven-color flames erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, engulfing Xue Sha’s soul. A pitiful scream echoed in the sky.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian disposed of Xue Sha, a roar echoed in his ears. He turned to the Howling Moon Wolf pack.

“Huh?” His crimson eyes displayed disbelief, gazing at a massive Howling Moon Wolf within the pack.

This wolf was even larger than others, and most notable was a tuft of golden fur on its neck.

“Wolf King…” Luo Tian murmured, but this was not his greatest surprise. His surprise came from the two wings—golden and azure—that spread out on either side of the wolf’s body.

Chapter 1779: Later Generations Have Not Seen Ghost Valley Mountain

“Roar…” Thousands of Howling Moon Wolves howled, their碧色 eyes filled with fervor as they gazed at the towering Wolf King.

The golden and azure wings spread out, extending three zhang in length. Waves of energy radiated from them, and the Wolf King’s eyes turned golden and azure.

“Evolved… a Wolf King comparable to a Celestial Daoist!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief, watching the Howling Moon Wolf King flap its wings and ascend.

“Ghost Valley Seal!” Liang Tian Guang, covered in blood, spoke hoarsely. At this moment, he was at his worst—surrounded by Howling Moon Wolf corpses, with large chunks of flesh missing and exposed bones. He was on the verge of being devoured by the wolves.

“Ghost Seal controls ghosts; Valley Seal controls beasts!” Liang Tian Guang’s eyes flashed with divine light, gazing at the golden barrier.

At this moment, the golden barrier was covered with green symbols, and the seemingly ordinary token had become extraordinary. Its rust vanished completely, revealing a “Valley” character etched in green.

The two tokens connected through complex divine patterns, as if responding to each other. Waves of energy emanated from the golden barrier, enveloping Luo Tian and others, as well as the Howling Moon Wolves.

“Unexpectedly, I was mistaken!” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the two tokens slowly converging.

“If I seize this Ghost Valley Seal, these Howling Moon Wolves will obey me! With the Wolf King, Luo Tian is doomed!” Liang Tian Guang thought, estimating his distance to the barrier—less than thirty zhang.

“Thirty zhang… I must break through!” Liang Tian Guang’s face bore madness, raising his hand to unleash a barrage of meteors that killed the surrounding Howling Moon Wolves.

“Roar…” However, as the meteors appeared, the Howling Moon Wolves let out a series of roars and howled skyward.

“Buzz…” Waves of energy emanated from the Wolf King’s mouth, and a black demon moon hovered before it. It shot out toward the meteors.

“Kill!” Liang Tian Guang ignored the wolves’ resistance, and a golden blade appeared in his hand. His blood surged, radiating an overwhelming aura.

At this moment, Luo Tian was careless; Liang Tian Guang knew it was his last chance. Thirty zhang—what was that to him? If he obtained the Ghost Valley Seal, he could turn the tide. If he failed, he might be devoured by the wolves.

Blades flashed, and several Howling Moon Wolves were slain. Liang Tian Guang rushed toward the golden barrier.

“Roar…” A low growl echoed again as the Wolf King, seeing Liang Tian Guang killing its kin, roared and flew toward him.

“Damn it!” Liang Tian Guang’s eyes flashed with madness. After a brief slaughter, he was only several zhang away from the golden barrier.

“Earth Dragon Power!” Liang Tian Guang roared, his aura rising again. He slashed, and it was clear that his burning blood surged into the golden blade.

Blades flashed, and seven adult Howling Moon Wolves were severed instantly, their cries falling to the ground.

“Boom…” Liang Tian Guang stomped the earth, using the opening to vanish from his spot and charge toward the golden barrier.

“Eight zhang… one zhang…”

In an instant, Liang Tian Guang stood before the golden barrier, his eyes filled with joy. He knew that entering the barrier would grant him temporary safety and allow him to seize the Ghost Valley Seal.

“Boom…” On the other side, the Wolf King had missed, landing on the ground where Liang Tian Guang had stood.

“Enter!” Liang Tian Guang’s face bore triumph as he stepped toward the golden barrier, which did not block him.

“You really don’t consider yourself an outsider!” A cold laugh echoed in Liang Tian Guang’s ears as Luo Tian appeared before him, his golden foot landing on Liang Tian Guang’s already bloodied face.

In the next moment, Liang Tian Guang’s body was expelled from the barrier, his eyes filled with despair.

“Roar…” Unfortunately, Liang Tian Guang’s flying position was exactly where the Wolf King stood.

Faced with this cruel killer of countless kin, the Wolf King did not hesitate; it opened its maw and bit down on Liang Tian Guang.

“Crack…” A breaking sound echoed as Liang Tian Guang’s powerful body was split in two. Blood flowed from the Wolf King’s mouth.

“Crack… crack…” A chilling sound echoed from the Wolf King’s mouth, and a suction force emerged. Liang Tian Guang’s remaining仙气 was sucked into the Wolf King’s body.

“Boom…” Liang Tian Guang’s corpse was spat onto the ground, instantly devoured by the Howling Moon Wolf pack.

“Roar…” After eliminating Liang Tian Guang, the Wolf King let out a low growl and rushed toward the golden barrier.

With the Wolf King’s roar, dozens of Howling Moon Wolves also rushed toward the golden barrier.

Luo Tian, now beneath the altar, felt a tremor in his spirit and wanted to leave immediately. On the ground, he could not match the Wolf King or the pack of Howling Moon Wolves.

“Boom…” However, as Luo Tian rose, a mature Howling Moon Wolf collided with the barrier.

Unlike Luo Tian and Liang Tian Guang, it was repelled by the golden barrier.

“Interesting!” Luo Tian’s face bore a slight smile as he leapt onto the altar, gazing at the dual-colored token floating above it. Without hesitation, he extended his hand to grasp it.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian seized the token, the Howling Moon Wolves became even more frenzied. They rushed toward the barrier without fear of death, including the Wolf King.

“Though I don’t know its use, it must be no ordinary item!” Luo Tian’s face bore a slight smile as he applied his refining power to the Ghost Valley Seal.

“Ghost Valley Seal… a token left by Guigu Zi, the founder of Ghost Valley Mountain. The one who possesses the Ghost Valley Seal becomes a disciple of Ghost Valley. There are nine such seals; when nine are united, one becomes the true disciple of Ghost Valley and learns its legendary technique—Controlling Objects. This allows control over all things in the world!”

“Controlling Objects… it has four levels: Controlling Ghosts, Beasts, Humans, and Heaven!” A domineering voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind as he refined the Ghost Valley Seal, causing his expression to slightly shift.

“Nine Divine Mountains… Guigu Mountain’s founder, Guigu Zi!” Luo Tian’s mind stirred, recalling this Ghost Valley Mountain.

Luo Tian had heard of Guigu Mountain before; when Long You Ran was at the Tianyuan Sect, he had introduced the Nine Divine Mountains to Luo Tian.

Guigu Mountain was the top of the Nine Divine Mountains, but after Guigu Zi disappeared into the divine realm with his mountain, only nine Ghost Valley Seals remained. Now, in the current divine realm, there were only eight Divine Mountains; people respected Guigu Zi and still referred to the Nine Divine Mountains, with Guigu Mountain always considered first.

“Later generations have not seen Ghost Valley Mountain; the old man calculated everything and became an immortal!”

“Immortality… people say Guigu Zi’s cultivation was unparalleled, leading Ghost Valley Mountain into the realm of eternal life beyond the six realms!”

“Guigu Zi had only two disciples: one was the founder of Tianji Mountain, the first Tianji Immortal; the other was the founder of Yutian Mountain, the first Yutian Immortal. It is said that the Yutian Immortal had reached the level of controlling humans!” The voice of Long You Ran echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, his eyes filled with admiration.

At the time, Luo Tian had been awestruck; even disciples were founders of divine mountains. How extraordinary was Guigu Zi!

“However, it’s just a legend… I don’t know if it’s true!” Luo Tian muttered quietly but felt immense excitement.

“Legends say Guigu Zi was powerful, but this Ghost Valley Seal must be no ordinary item!” Luo Tian’s face bore a slight smile as he sat cross-legged on the altar.

“Controlling Ghosts…初级 allows controlling ghosts of one’s own level; medium-level allows controlling ghosts one level higher. Mastery allows a Celestial Daoist to control the soul of a True Immortal. At midnight, gather wandering ghosts from heaven and earth into one’s body…” A series of incantations appeared in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Controlling Beasts…初级 allows controlling beasts of one’s own level; medium-level…” After refining the Ghost Valley Seal, Luo Tian gained two techniques—Controlling Ghosts and Beasts. His expression was filled with joy.

As Luo Tian fully refined the Ghost Valley Seal, the frenzied Howling Moon Wolf pack—including the Wolf King—calmed down. Their eyes showed affection as they gazed at Luo Tian, who sat cross-legged on the altar.

“Is this the benefit of being a disciple?” Luo Tian’s eyes held satisfaction as he gazed at each Howling Moon Wolf.

“However, refining Controlling Beasts and Ghosts to the初级 level is quite difficult…” Luo Tian muttered quietly, but his heart was filled with excitement. If he could master it, and if he subdued a True Immortal-level beast, would he not be invincible?

“From now on, follow me! I never expected such an opportunity upon arriving in the divine realm!” Luo Tian muttered quietly, stepping out of the golden barrier.

Chapter 1780: Departure

“Roar…” The dense Howling Moon Wolf pack lowed, their dominant presence in the Endtimes Forest now kneeling before Luo Tian. If anyone saw this scene, they would be stunned into silence.

“Controlling Beasts… Controlling Ghosts…”

“As a Soul-Subduing Master, I naturally have control over souls. Combined with my identity as a Soul-Subduing Master, subduing souls is not difficult for me!”

“However, divine realm rules limit this—only True Immortals can leave souls behind. But what is this ghost? It seems different from a soul! Moreover, I am a Soul-Subduing Master; killing a Celestial Daoist and extracting their residual soul is not difficult for me!”

“Controlling Beasts, however, will be much more challenging!” Luo Tian muttered quietly, extending his hand. Waves of energy radiated from it.

“Roar…” As the waves emanated, the Howling Moon Wolf pack lowed again. Their mouths exhaled blue energy, gathering above Luo Tian’s head and forming a strange symbol that entered his body. It eventually became an intangible mark etched in Luo Tian’s consciousness.

“Controlling Beasts Mark… when it becomes tangible, the初级 level of Controlling Beasts is achieved!” Luo Tian’s face bore a slight smile. He then stored the Ghost Valley Seal, no longer needing it to command the Howling Moon Wolves.

“This is one of my hidden cards. If I lure enemies into the Endtimes Forest, combined with the Wolf King and these wolves, I can have a chance to eliminate a Celestial Daoist at the middle stage. However, this requires that the enemy is not in the sky!” Luo Tian muttered quietly.

“Go!” Luo Tian addressed the Wolf King, then extended his hand to grasp the soul of Xue Sha, who was screaming in seven-color flames. The soul transformed into gray gas and entered Luo Tian’s consciousness, forming a soul mark. Compared to the Controlling Beasts Mark, it was much weaker; unless closely observed, one would not notice its presence.

“Roar…” The Wolf King let out a low growl, and its body began to shrink. Its two prominent wings were retracted into its form.

“Compared to Xiaohei, this one is much more beautiful!” Luo Tian gazed at the Wolf King with azure fur, now reduced to his knee height. He muttered quietly while leading it out of the Endtimes Forest.

……

In the Five Cities, after Luo Tian eliminated Li Xiulong, Li Tianxiao, and other high-ranking members of the Li Family in Shilong City, the Li Family’s power was seized by the other four cities. Dragon Singing City rose to become the top among the Five Cities.

Luo Tian’s name became renowned across the Five Cities. His victory over Li Tianxiao on Shilong Mountain, as well as his clashes with the disciples of Luan Tian Sect and Zhen Xian Sect, were widely known.

For a century, the Five Cities had no one who could match Luo Tian’s strength—except for those who entered sects. He was the first Celestial Daoist among the Five Cities.

However, after the battle on Shilong Mountain, Luo Tian vanished from public view and never appeared again. The Tianyuan Sect also fell silent, as if it had disappeared entirely.

Liang Youlan, the daughter of Dragon Singing City’s Lord and a close ally of Tianyuan Sect, went to visit the sect. Upon returning, she secluded herself and was heard weeping in her room by servants.

Later, someone dared to visit Tianyuan Sect but found it in ruins with no signs of life. The entire sect had been burned to ashes, leaving only ash.

“Some say Luo Tian offended someone and was killed while pursuing Yao Qishui. Tianyuan Sect was also completely destroyed…”

“I’ve heard it too; apparently, Zhu Fenghuo returned personally and killed Luo Tian!” Rumors spread throughout the Five Cities.

“What a pity! He had just ascended to Celestial Daoist, and with his strength and talent, he might have joined Tianmen Sect!” Someone sighed.

“His ambition was too great; without a background, he dared to kill Zhu Fenghuo’s brother and chase after the disciples of Zhen Xian Sect, Yao Qishui, and the grandson of a Luan Tian Sect elder. This was self-destruction! Any Celestial Daoist at the middle stage from these three sects could have crushed him!” Various rumors circulated in the Five Cities.

Outside Dragon Singing City’s Lord’s mansion, a group of figures surrounded it, gazing at the vast mansion.

“Long Li, what do you think? Are you going to hand over our goods?” A bald man stood at the mansion’s gate, shouting into it.

This bald man was none other than Sun Luoshan, Lord of Luoshan City. Zhang Lie and Zhang Kuangfeng stood beside him, their eyes filled with mockery.

The news of Luo Tian’s death had rekindled their ambitions. Shilong City was a rich territory, and Long Li controlled half its resources, which they envied. Now that Luo Tian was missing, the three had united to pressure Long Li into surrendering most of Shilong City’s control.

“Are you regretting it?” Long Li’s eyes flashed with anger as he stepped out of the mansion, gazing at Sun Luoshan and the others.

“No regrets. Shilong City was originally leaderless; what talent do you have to occupy so much territory?” Sun Luoshan rubbed his bald head and smiled.

“Back when Luo Tian was around, you didn’t say this!” Liang Youlan spoke to Sun Luoshan and the others.

“Still relying on that Luo Tian? He might have already been killed. Tianyuan Sect is gone, and we were afraid of Luo Tian before. Now, Long Li, you decide—either hand it over or not. If you do, everything is fine; if not, we won’t be polite!” Zhang Lie shouted.

“I’m about to take the exam at Tianmen Sect. If I enter it, won’t you be afraid?” Liang Youlan shouted back.

“Ha! You’re my niece, but I don’t look down on you. Tianmen Sect is one of the three major sects in the lower divine realm. Your talent is good, but entering Tianmen Sect’s outer gate is like climbing the sky! Think about reality!” Sun Luoshan grinned, his eyes filled with mockery.

“You have one hour to decide—hand it over or not. Our demands are fair: split Shilong City among four cities. If you don’t, we’ll have no choice but to act!” Sun Luoshan spoke again.

Hearing Sun Luoshan’s words, Long Li fell silent. If he handed it over, he could avoid trouble, but the three clearly had a united front. In the future, they would surely become more aggressive. Moreover, if he handed it over, Dragon Singing City’s prestige would also suffer.
