“Immortal Tide? Finally, something related to immortals!” His white robe as pure as snow, a young man with a serene expression raised his hand, and a blade’s radiance flashed, slaying an exile. He spoke softly.

“This Immortal Tide’s spiritual energy is mine! I shall become immortal and enter the celestial realm to seek my father!” A youth wreathed in verdant aura, his face alight with laughter, took a step forward and rushed toward the towering column of light.

“Damn it! We must eliminate these two nuisances before our forces converge!” Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin fled desperately, dashing toward the light. Behind them, Nan Gong Wu Bei and Sun Zhangyang led a dozen robed warriors in pursuit.

“Converge? I welcome it. Who knows who will be the one to kill whom?” Sun Zhangyang sneered, responding with a laugh.

“Hah! Truly enticing! But even if you seize it, you’ll have to hand it over to me!” On a dilapidated altar stood a figure cloaked in golden radiance, seated cross-legged. His eyes gleamed with divine light as he etched patterns onto the seemingly completed altar.

“Let’s go! Such a commotion must have alerted everyone in the Crimson Battlefield. Zheng Xin and his lot would never miss such an opportunity!” Luo Tian chuckled, then his eyes flashed with battlelust. He knew the war was about to begin. The clash of human prodigies across the Nine Realms—those who shone here would have greater chances to attain enlightenment. This was but a prelude to the trial of ascension.

“I’ll see who dares harm me!” Luo Tian’s face was icy, and he vanished in a blur alongside Sun Mengru, rushing toward the column of light piercing heaven and earth.

The entire Crimson Battlefield stirred with the Immortal Tide’s eruption. Figures, eyes wild with frenzy, flew toward its direction. Yet all knew: not everyone was worthy of this vast spiritual energy.

Chapter 1713: Gathering of the Strong

Figures converged from all directions toward the battlefield’s heart. Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi, though young and strikingly beautiful, drew no attention. Though Sun Mengru’s beauty stirred many glances, it was but a fleeting admiration compared to the Immortal Tide.

“I claim this Immortal Tide!” A roar echoed as a figure, his aura overwhelming, appeared before the surging column. Greed twisted his face as he charged toward the celestial tide.

“Boom!” Before his cry faded, a bloodstained blade sliced through the air, cleaving his body. Blood sprayed into the sky, entwined with crimson runes. His form dissolved into mist and soul, instantly devoured.

“Dare you?” A cold voice echoed. A youth in blood-red robes strode forward, each step spanning hundreds of feet. He materialized before the tide, radiating a chilling aura.

As he arrived, figures appeared around the tide—over three hundred in total. Though their eyes burned with desire, none dared act rashly.

“Unexpectedly, so many share my intent!” The blood-red-robed youth’s eyes flashed cold. He retrieved the Star River Seal from the slain man.

“Still, it suits me—gather a hundred seals for the inner sect’s trial!” His eyes darkened with murder, scanning each figure.

“Is that Xue Yan Luo? Why is he here? His strength alone could have made him an outer sect disciple!” People shivered, recognizing his identity.

“I see. He’s been biding his time for the inner sect trial!” Their faces lit with understanding.

“Truly patient! He’s sacrificed his outer disciple status for years. And he never appeared in previous tides!” Murmurs of awe filled the air, reverence for Xue Yan Luo. Once, he had been a prodigy destined for outer sect status.

“Hah! I’m not the only one with this thought!” Before they could recover, a loud laugh echoed. A burly man strode forth, his face wild with fervor, radiating a sky-shaking aura.

“Guan Yuxin! He’s still here!” Their voices rose in shock.

“Back then, I couldn’t match him. Now I have my chance!” Before they could react, a youth in embroidered robes stepped forth, sword drawn. His gaze locked onto Xue Yan Luo and Guan Yuxin.

“Marshall Xu Zhen! My heavens, will we live?” Their cries echoed as they saw the newcomer.

Xue Yan Luo, Guan Yuxin, and Marshall Xu Zhen—three men who could have become outer sect disciples. In their cohort, they were top-tier prodigies. Even Star River Sect elders had attempted to court them. Yet their pride dismissed outer sect status, so they remained.

“Xu Zhen, are you challenging me?” Guan Yuxin’s eyes blazed with battlelust.

“Enough talk. First, deal with these initiates!” Xu Zhen smiled, scanning the crowd.

“Who are the new initiates?” Xu Zhen barked, his gaze cold.

“Right! Eliminate these brats first. I was once killed by our batch’s initiates!”

“Yes! If not for those bastards, I’d already be an outer sect disciple!” The crowd roared, scanning their surroundings to spot the unfamiliar.

“Damn it! These bastards!” Sun Feiwen stood amidst the crowd, immediately targeted by watchful eyes.

“Damn it!” Yan Hongtao, Run Hongyu, and Zhou Wei were also spotted instantly.

“Group together!” They exchanged glances, gathering swiftly. Their gazes turned solemn as they faced the watchful exiles.

“Too weak—no spiritual energy cultivated!” The exiles sneered at the gathered teens.

“Come on, I’ll fight you!” As they looked down, a voice barked. Yao Chen strode forward, staff in hand, radiating power that left the crowd stunned.

“Are you really going to attack us?” Zhu Ge Qingtian sneered, his body wreathed in verdant aura as he stepped before the Zhu Ge Dynasty.

“Interesting!” Run Hongyu smiled, his aura sharp. His eyes gleamed as he regarded them.

“These three are formidable!” The crowd’s gazes darkened, even Xue Yan Luo and Guan Yuxin felt a flicker of unease at the trio’s presence.

“Come on, fight!” Yao Chen’s eyes flashed cold. Without a word, he swung his staff, striking a middle-aged man.

Elation coursed through Yao Chen since entering the Crimson Battlefield. This place felt tailor-made for him—prodigies abounded, even those near the King’s Realm could be slain. The weakest here were at the Epoch Peak.

“Damn!” The exile saw the golden staff sweeping toward him. His realm was Epoch Peak, but against Yao Chen’s might, he felt powerless.

“Why me!” The man seethed, raising a green sword. No choice but to fight.

“Crash!” The sword shattered. The golden staff, pressing down with celestial might, swept over the man.

Blood mist erupted, crimson blood staining the staff. All gasped in awe.

Dominance—Yao Chen’s nature made him霸道, only Dragon Jie listened.

“One strike to kill a half-Heaven’s Path cultivator!” All faces bore awe, gazing at the golden monkey. Never had they seen such strength.

“Damn it! I’ve never met a trialist so bold. All attack, kill these initiates!” A curse echoed, igniting the crowd.

They resented it. Once, they had been cautious, but now they were slain by Yao Chen’s group. This angered them.

“Kill…” They leapt forward, their auras surging as they eyed the gathered Yao Chen group.

“Hum…” The Golden Emperor Mirror floated, radiating supreme aura. It hovered above Long Jie’s head.

“Are you challenging numbers?” Long Jie coldly spoke, stepping before Yao Chen. His gaze was authoritative.

At the same time, Star Tower and Chaos Bell—two Epoch Treasures—roared to life. Supreme aura descended upon the crowd, shaking their souls.

“Treasures forged by Heaven’s Path cultivators!” The sight of the three supreme artifacts made Xue Yan Luo and others pale.

“Try. See who dies!” Zhu Ge Qingtian sneered, standing beneath the Chaos Bell.

“Even with Heaven’s Path treasures? I observed—they lack spiritual energy. We can withstand five treasures!” A voice called, but few responded. Spiritual energy was precious; no one wished to waste it.

“Each of you releases spiritual energy, and kill them!” Xue Yan Luo whispered, exchanging glances with Guan Yuxin and Xu Zhen. Their hands radiated waves of power.

“They’ve targeted those treasures!” The crowd scattered, eyes on Xue Yan Luo and others.

“Of course. Those treasures are no ordinary forged—seemingly imbued with Heaven’s Path cultivators’ imprints!” Someone mused, greed in their voice.

“Since you insist on fighting, fight. See who dies!” Long Jie snorted, Epoch power surging as he fully activated the Emperor Realm.

“Still so…!” As they prepared, a solemn voice echoed. Supreme pressure descended, changing all faces.

Chapter 1714: This Arrogance is Well Done

Supreme pressure descended, changing all faces. They gazed in disbelief at the approaching figures.

A youth in purple robes stood solemn, hands behind his back. His body was thin but seemed like a mountain to others.

Behind him followed youths with cold faces, their power immense yet overshadowed by the frontmost purple-robed youth.

“Heaven’s Path!” Xue Yan Luo and others’ faces changed, eyes wide with disbelief.

Heaven’s Path—they had seen it before. Though they had connections in the celestial realm, Heaven’s Path was still attainable. This youth’s aura confirmed it.

They had thought themselves the strongest in the Crimson Battlefield, but now a Heaven’s Path cultivator appeared. One could change everything.

“Pf!” Unlike the exiles, the Nine Realms’ people grimaced. The intruders were none other than Diao Dezhu and his group.

“Diao Dezhu, your old habit resurfaced!” Seeing Diao Dezhu’s overwhelming aura, Long Jie and others sighed inwardly but respected him. Such a scene could be faked, yet he truly simulated Emperor Realm aura.

“Are you going to attack them?” Diao Dezhu smiled, walking toward Xue Yan Luo. His gaze was on the three.

“Not at all…” Xue Yan Luo and others had been stunned. They hadn’t noticed the torn fabric on Diao Dezhu’s robe.

“Good! They are my friends. If you harm them, I’ll be displeased!” Diao Dezhu smiled, patting Xue Yan Luo’s shoulder. The three trembled.

“This Immortal Tide I’ll absorb. No objections?” Diao Dezhu ignored their trembling and addressed them.

“None. Just beg the master to share some!” Xue Yan Luo’s mind cursed. They had waited years for this chance, but now a Heaven’s Path cultivator took it.

Yet, with the situation against them, one Heaven’s Path could crush them without a trace.

“Don’t just stand there. Enter!” Diao Dezhu knew when to stop, turning his back on Xue Yan Luo. He ordered Long Jie’s group.

“Yes!” Hearing Diao Dezhu, Sun Ke Nian didn’t hesitate. He first cooperated with Diao Dezhu’s arrogance, bowing to him before rushing toward the tide.

“Damn! This works!” The Nine Realms’ people were delighted. Diao Dezhu’s arrogance had yielded such results.

Seeing this gift, they wouldn’t miss it. Including Yao Chen, all rushed toward the tide.

Twenty-something figures entered the tide’s altar, which could hold thirty. They sat cross-legged, refining the surging spiritual energy.

“Great fortune!” As they sat, their hearts surged. If they refined all this spiritual energy, their strength would soar. They’d no longer fear the exiles.

The former initiates watched enviously, biting their teeth. But Diao Dezhu stood there, preventing them from acting.

“Stay outside. Perhaps I’ll leave some!” Diao Dezhu felt triumphant, back straight as he entered the tide with them.

The scene calmed momentarily. Diao Dezhu and others openly refined the surging spiritual energy under jealous eyes.

“Strange. This Heaven’s Path cultivator refines so slowly?” Soon, people noticed something amiss. They expected a Heaven’s Path cultivator to refine quickly, but this one was as slow as others. Even slower than the monkey who had slain a half-Heaven’s Path.

“Maybe he wants to let others?” People murmured but dared not enter, absorbing the madness-inducing spiritual energy.

Wind surged. As people discussed, figures appeared again—Nan Gong Wu Bei and Sun Zhangyang’s group. Other directions also had moving figures, their auras strong.

“Another arrived!” People turned to the newcomers. But seeing no Heaven’s Path, they sighed in relief.

“Damn! You chased too fast!” Though Diao Dezhu’s group refined spiritual energy, they were anxious. They watched outside constantly. Upon Nan Gong Wu Bei’s arrival, they noticed immediately, cursing inwardly while planning to escape.

“What now?” They quickly communicated, seeking solutions. This opportunity was too good to abandon.

“Diao Dezhu, send outsiders to intercept Nan Gong Wu Bei!” Jiang Nanhuan smiled, transmitting to Diao Dezhu.

“That’s something I can’t command!” Diao Dezhu replied, eyeing Jiang Nanhuan.

“Past you couldn’t. But now you can! Trust to buy time!” Jiang Nanhuan transmitted, making Diao Dezhu’s eyes flicker. He then addressed Xue Yan Luo.

“Go kill them! I’m currently unable to act. Whoever kills them may enter the tide!” Diao Dezhu’s authoritative voice echoed, making all eyes brighten. They watched the approaching Nan Gong Wu Bei.

“Kill!” Though sensing Nan Gong Wu Bei’s danger, they preferred them over Diao Dezhu. A hundred figures rushed toward Nan Gong Wu Bei.

Nan Gong Wu Bei’s face darkened, joining with Fu Tu and a powerful youth from other directions.

“Kill!” Though unsure why former initiates attacked them, they guessed it related to Diao Dezhu.

“These fools! Why obey those bastards!” Fu Tu’s group grimaced but had no time to think. The exiles charged, even Xue Yan Luo and others joined.

Shouts of battle erupted. Martial arts clashed in the sky, chaos spreading. The crimson sky cracked under powerful collisions.

Diao Dezhu and others on the altar sighed, admiration for Jiang Nanhuan’s plan.

“After so long, he still is clever!” Zheng Xin sighed, knowing Jiang Nanhuan best.

“What’s happening?” Meanwhile, Luo Tian, Jiang Sixi, Leng Qiuchan, and Sun Mengru arrived at the chaos’s edge. Their faces showed confusion, awe.

“Look at those sitting in the tide!” Sun Mengru’s eyes gleamed. She saw the Nine Realms’ group sitting, stunned.

“They sit calmly, refining spiritual energy while these two groups fight!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“Fu Tu, Nan Gong Wu Bei, Sun Zhangyang!” Then Luo Tian recognized three familiar faces.

“Who’s the other?” He turned to a golden-robed youth fighting with Fu Tu.

“Don’t know. But he must be a son of an Epoch Master or ancient king. Many Epoch Masters’ sons have emerged recently!” Sun Mengru whispered.

“Let’s refine the spiritual energy first, even if we don’t know why these guys fight!” Luo Tian smiled, rushing toward the tide.

“Luo Tian! I’ve found you!” Before he moved, a roar echoed. Luo Tian halted.

“Rustle…” Before he turned, searing heat rose behind him—a massive sword wrapped in purple flames slammed down.

Chapter 1715: The Fire Lord’s Daughter

Searing heat, before reaching Luo Tian, cracked the earth. His four companions frowned, eyes turning solemn.

“Hum…” Luo Tian suddenly turned, his golden crackling spear sweeping out. It clashed with the massive sword wrapped in purple flames.

“Stomp… stomp…” Luo Tian took three steps back, his face showing solemnity. He was shocked by the opponent’s strength.

“Brother, who are you? Did I offend you?” He stopped, seeing the attacker. His face was angry.

A red-robed woman with short hair—her figure was slender, but Luo Tian’s first glance saw her delicate face. He asked.

But before he finished, he regretted it. He clearly remembered the voice was female. And he saw her figure—slender yet full-figured.

“Who do you call brother?” A furious voice echoed. The woman, like a tomboy, carried the massive sword on her shoulder. Her eyes flashed anger.

“Ma’am, I’ve never met you. Why attack me?” Luo Tian suddenly realized he was ambushed. His face turned serious.

But behind him, three cold blades pressed against his neck—three jade hands already at his waist.

“Haha! Took others’ things and left without a trace!” The woman laughed, her figure swaying. Luo Tian’s eyes were stunned.

“Big…” He silently praised. This woman looked like a tomboy, but her figure was unmatched. Her bust was the best he’d seen. If she wore long hair, she could be a beauty. But from her words, he knew this woman was bold and fierce like Luo Qingqing.

“Hiss…” As Luo Tian marveled, pain shot his waist. A cold voice echoed in his ear: “Looking? When did you finish?”

Jiang Sixi, Leng Qiuchan, and Sun Mengru’s jade hands twisted his waist. Their eyes were sharp, making Luo Tian shiver.

“Ma’am, I truly don’t know you. You must have mistaken me!” Luo Tian spoke seriously.

“Don’t lie! Do you know who I am? My name is Meng Xue. You must have heard of me!” The woman roared, her face more furious.

“Meng Xue. Meng Xue… I think I’ve heard of her…” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion, murmuring.

“Indeed!” Hearing Luo Tian’s murmur, Jiang Sixi and others felt more anger. A sourness arose behind Luo Tian.

“Don’t misunderstand, I’ve only heard of her, never met!” Luo Tian protested loudly.

“I remember! Meng Xue is the Fire Lord’s son!” Jiang Sixi and others thought, eyes widening at Meng Xue in red robes.

“The Fire Lord’s daughter…” Luo Tian was stunned. He hadn’t expected to meet the Fire Lord’s son here.

“But what does that have to do with me?” Luo Tian looked at Meng Xue, innocent. Why was this furious woman after him? When had he offended her?

“Still lying!” Meng Xue saw Luo Tian’s face, her chest rising and falling. Her temper showed as she swung the massive sword again.

“Damn it! I owe you something?” Luo Tian was annoyed. His face turned cold, and he gripped his crackling spear, rushing toward her.

“Crack!” A thunderous sound echoed. Invisible waves spread outward. Luo Tian took two steps back, his gaze deep on Meng Xue.

Meng Xue’s face showed surprise but also excitement. She rushed toward Luo Tian, her massive sword swinging with a power beyond her height—swinging with violent beauty.

“Fear me?” Luo Tian roared, sensing Meng Xue’s tenacity. But he didn’t care. He rushed toward her with his spear.

Clashes echoed, but people weren’t too concerned. The battlefield was chaotic; no one cared about Luo Tian and Meng Xue’s fight.

“Not that kind of relationship!” Jiang Sixi, Leng Qiuchan, and Sun Mengru crossed their arms, watching Luo Tian clash with Meng Xue. They nodded slightly.

Yet they didn’t help. They stood still, waiting for Luo Tian’s fight to end. Their senses told them Meng Xue, though temperamental, held back—no killing intent.

Luo Tian and Meng Xue clashed repeatedly. Their gazes showed solemnity after dozens of exchanges.

“Strong! You match my strength!” Luo Tian pushed Meng Xue back, amazed. His body was变态 (abnormal), so he felt no inferiority against those who lived second lives. But this Meng Xue didn’t fall behind.

Luo Tian was amazed, but so was Meng Xue. She had heard of Luo Tian’s name but never believed it. Due to her status, her father had used various flames to refine her body. Though she looked delicate, her physique was变态.

“Again!” Meng Xue, a battle-loving soul, had no intention of backing down. A single disagreement led to fighting.

“Flame Sword Art!” Meng Xue roared, nine fire dragons bursting from her body. They wrapped around the massive sword, forming strange imprints. The sword rushed toward Luo Tian.

Scorching heat and powerful waves filled the air. The red massive sword seemed to split heaven and earth, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Wind and Cloud Spear Art!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened. He shot out golden spear shadows, forming a golden storm toward the red sword.

“Clang! Clang!” A series of collisions echoed. Each collision was like thunder, and both Luo Tian and Meng Xue retreated.

“Strong waves!” As they used martial arts, people noticed their fight. Their collision waves were only slightly weaker than those of Xue Yan Luo and others.

“Another strongman!” People’s faces showed confusion. They saw Luo Tian and Meng Xue retreating, but upon seeing Meng Xue’s full figure, their eyes lit up. Then they noticed Jiang Sixi and others standing there.

“Too beautiful! Such a beauty is rare even in the celestial realm!” People marveled, eyes full of aggression.

“Hmph…” Seeing their gazes, Jiang Sixi, Leng Qiuchan, and Sun Mengru’s faces turned icy. Their aura radiated coldness, a no-entry sign.

“Luo Tian!” Sitting in the tide, refining spiritual energy while observing the battlefield, Diao Dezhu’s face lit up. He hadn’t expected to meet Luo Tian here.

“Luo Tian!” Nan Gong Wu Bei and others fighting against Xue Yan Luo, Guan Yuxin, and Xu Zhen turned pale. Their eyes flashed with hatred.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve come to Star River Sect!” Nan Gong Wu Bei and Fu Tu were delighted.

“Kid, fighting me while distracted?” Xue Yan Luo didn’t know who Luo Tian was. They thought killing these people would let them enter the tide, and collecting Star River Seals would be a double win.

“Boom!” Xue Yan Luo’s hand slammed, green hands crushing Sun Zhangyang. Blood sprayed as he fell into a pit.

Fu Tu and Nan Gong Wu Bei were also wounded, their faces pale as they faced the exiles’ auras.

“Kill!” They paused briefly before rushing toward Xue Yan Luo again.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian and Meng Xue clashed. Meng Xue grew more excited, her massive sword dancing. Flames erupted from her body, surrounding the sword and rushing toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian activated the Buddha Heaven Attack Art, his crackling spear becoming alive. It countered Meng Xue’s attacks.

Chapter 1716: The Fire Lord’s Dowry

At the battlefield’s edge, two figures clashed. Golden spears met red swords, each collision sending waves that seemed to shatter the crimson sky.

“Are they ever done?” Jiang Sixi frowned. She felt if they continued, something would go wrong. She worried the tomboy-like Meng Xue might take an interest in Luo Tian, as she couldn’t be judged by normal standards.

“Be careful. I’m about to fight seriously!” Meng Xue stood proudly on the crimson earth, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Come then!” Luo Tian’s battlelust flared. His arms ached, and he tightened his crackling spear.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Meng Xue spoke but didn’t wait for Luo Tian’s agreement. Her body erupted with thunderous sounds, and a red fire dragon burst forth, circling the sword as before.

Then orange flames surged. Yellow flames rose… seven fire dragons, each color distinct and scorching. Each flame radiated intense heat, as if burning everything.

“Similar to Xiao Qi’s flames!” Luo Tian narrowed his eyes. He felt pressure from the fire, and his aura surged as he infused Epoch power into his spear.

“She’s sword isn’t simple. If I’m not mistaken, it must be a treasure forged by the Fire Lord. Otherwise, it wouldn’t withstand my crackling spear so long without issue!” Jiang Sixi whispered, watching Meng Xue surrounded by seven-colored flames.

“Roar…” Before Jiang Sixi’s words ended, the seven fire dragons transformed into seven runes, attaching to the sword.

“Hum…” The humming echoed. Meng Xue’s sword radiated supreme aura after being covered by the seven-colored runes. Its blade surged with power.
