“Hail the Second Prince!” Over a thousand people instantly bowed respectfully to Fu Xingyue, having learned of her ruthless nature. Even the Third Prince remained incapacitated after being beaten by Fu Xingyue.

“Your Highness, may we take Xiao Ding?” Yet one audacious youth, a half-epoch master, cautiously addressed Fu Xingyue.

This youth's background was formidable, his strength considerable. He doubted Fu Xingyue would risk antagonizing him and his faction over a single Star Moon Guard.

“Smack!” Before the youth's words finished, Fu Xingyue's palm struck him.

“I told you to leave. Didn't you hear? Do you think I fear your faction?" Fu Xingyue coldly spoke. Now Fu Xingyue had matured significantly, both in character and power, exuding a royal aura.

“Yes!” Seeing Fu Xingyue's true anger, the crowd hastily rose and scattered in chaos.

The youth glared at Luo Tian with venom before wiping blood from his lips and walking away.

“Enough. Let's hurry!” Fu Xingyue smiled at Luo Tian.

They walked together, no one dared trouble Luo Tian again. Luo Tian sighed inwardly—power was indeed beneficial; no one dared bother him now. No wonder so many craved authority.

Fu Xingyue personally escorted Luo Tian to the back mountain of the Alchemy Hall, then persuaded Fu Tianqing to reduce costs. She finally departed.

“Begin! After entering the Thunder Roar Palace, leave Xingyue Divine City. Let Fu Xingyue ascend as the Divine Emperor—this is my way of repaying her care over these years!” Luo Tian's face bore a wistful expression as he sat cross-legged to adjust his state.

Days passed, the Alchemy Hall remained shrouded in gloom as thunder continuously descended. Initially people were curious, but soon they grew accustomed. During this time, Fu Xingxuan visited the Alchemy Hall several times, observing the thunder on the back mountain. Her eyes first showed admiration then anger before she stomped away.

Time flowed steadily. The early activation of the Thunder Roar Palace spread throughout the city, and people realized this time's activation might differ from past ones.

Two months passed. According to Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue's agreement, Fu Xingyue appeared at the back mountain of the Alchemy Hall with anticipation.

“Boom...” The final thunder struck, absorbed by a barrier's array. After two months of closure, the barrier finally opened slowly.

Luo Tian emerged bloodshot-eyed and pale before Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingxuan, and Fu Tianqing. Two months of alchemy had nearly exhausted him; without the Heavenly Thunder Dispel Fire within the mountain wall, he wouldn't have endured such a terrifying drain.

“His alchemy mastery is astonishing—unparalleled in my lifetime!” Fu Tianqing's face showed reverence as he watched Luo Tian descend the mountain, his body visibly thinner. He spoke softly.

"Hmph. After finishing alchemy, I'll make him suffer. Also, Second Brother, that annoying manure-scooping commander—why hasn't he returned?" Fu Xingxuan sneered at Fu Xingyue.

"Hail the Old Divine Emperor, Second Prince, Princess!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully before Fu Xingyue's trio, feeling uneasy under Fu Xingxuan's gaze.

"How did it go?" Fu Xingyue's face showed eagerness. Compared to others, he particularly wanted to know how many Saint-grade middle-tier elixirs Luo Tian had crafted.

Chapter 1314: Fu Xingchen's Breakthrough

Two months passed, the sky above the Alchemy Hall remained stormy. Now that Luo Tian stopped alchemizing, sunlight finally shone through.

Below the Alchemy Hall's back mountain, Fu Tianqing, Fu Xingyue, and even Fu Xingxuan wore expectant expressions, eager to see how many elixirs Luo Tian had crafted these past days.

Luo Tian smiled, handing Fu Xingyue a storage pouch with reverence: "I failed once. Total of fifty-eight Saint-grade middle-tier elixirs, Second Prince—I've done my best!"

"Fifty-eight! Only one failure!" Fu Tianqing and Fu Xingxuan gasped in disbelief.

Both were alchemists, naturally aware of the difficulty of successful elixirs. While one or two might be manageable, too many inevitably led to mistakes.

"Terrifying! Such a high success rate! I'm humbled!" Fu Tianqing's face showed bitterness, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

Hearing Fu Tianqing's words, Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingchen were stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Among the Xingyue Divine Clan, Fu Tianqing's strength needed no explanation. Besides three attendants who could restrain him, in alchemy he was always the most proud. Now Fu Tianqing admitted Luo Tian's alchemy surpassed his, revealing how formidable Luo Tian's skill had become.

Fu Xingxuan's eyes gleamed with unusual emotion, gazing at Luo Tian. This was the first time she'd seen such an outstanding youth—though his strength wasn't great, his alchemy was dazzling.

"Enough. You've worked hard. Rest well. When I exit the Thunder Roar Palace, I'll reward you properly!" Fu Xingyue smiled, injecting epoch power into Luo Tian's body with a fingertip. His eyes showed gratitude.

Fifty-plus elixirs equaled over five million contributions. After deducting ten for fees, forty-eight remained—solving Fu Xingyue's problem instantly. How could he not be grateful?

"Second Brother, go ahead. As for rewarding Xiao Ding, leave it to me. After all, he's now my subordinate, right? You once promised to give him to me!" Fu Xingxuan smiled playfully at Fu Xingyue.

"This..." Fu Xingyue hesitated, reluctant to send Luo Tian away. Such talent could elevate the Star Moon Guards' alchemy significantly.

Yet he had indeed promised Fu Xingxuan, and Fu Xingyue deeply cherished his sister. He wavered.

Hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Luo Tian's face darkened instantly. Recalling his past experiences, he foresaw a bleak future.

"Second Prince, I was born a Star Moon Guard and will die as one. Do you intend to abandon me?" Luo Tian gazed at Fu Xingyue, disappointment in his eyes.

"Ugh..." Fu Xingyue felt guilty under Luo Tian's gaze, then hesitated looking at Fu Xingxuan.

"Um... maybe you should..."

"Don't love me anymore, Second Brother!" Before Fu Xingyue finished speaking, Fu Xingxuan's purple eyes turned teary, gazing at Fu Xingyue.

"Monster! Monster!" Luo Tian inwardly roared: "Second Prince, don't agree! Don't be deceived by her acting!"

"Ah... well, Xiao Ding, you'll follow the Princess for now. But your Star Moon Guard status remains; you can return to Star Moon Hall anytime!" Fu Xingyue sighed, addressing Luo Tian.

"Following Xingxuan isn't bad. She's also an alchemist; you can guide her in refining elixirs!" Fu Xingyue didn't let Luo Tian speak, deciding the matter immediately.

"Fu Xingyue, you bastard Fu Xingyue! You're not human. I worked hard with you for half a year, and now you sell me out!" Luo Tian inwardly cursed Fu Xingyue, his face showing reluctant sorrow.

"Enough. You two chat. I need to handle these elixirs! Xingxuan, reward Xiao Ding properly—don't forget!" Fu Xingyue smiled, addressing the three before vanishing from their sight. After all, the Thunder Roar Palace was about to open; he had much to do.

"Second..." Luo Tian started, wanting to use his acting skills to plead further, but Fu Xingyue had already vanished.

"Wha...?" Fu Xingyue turned, swaying her tiny waist before Luo Tian, eyes still teary but appearing pitiful. Yet Luo Tian felt a chill down his spine.

"Where, where? It's my honor to follow Princess Xingxuan. How could I refuse? I was just showing loyalty!" Luo Tian knew he must please Fu Xingxuan, smiling sycophantically at her.

"Ah? Your smile reminds me of someone I dislike!" Fu Xingxuan looked at Luo Tian with confusion.

"Terrifying! Terrifying!" Luo Tian shivered, then smiled: "Your Highness jests. I've only met you twice!"

"Hmph. Your sycophantic smile reminds me of another annoying person! Come, I'll reward you properly!" Fu Xingxuan smiled radiantly at Luo Tian.

"Um, young sir, if you're free, come discuss alchemy with me!" Fu Tianqing, recovering from his disappointment, addressed Luo Tian.

"Master, I do have some questions to ask!" Luo Tian, hearing Fu Tianqing's words, felt like finding a lifeline.

"Grandpa, let me rest first. I'll come later; I'll play for a few days then bring you!" Fu Xingxuan ignored everything, summoning a holy force hand to grab Luo Tian and vanish before Fu Tianqing's eyes.

"Play... play...!" Luo Tian trembled, feeling his darkest days had arrived.

Fu Xingxuan quickly reached the manure pit where Luo Tian once scooped, throwing him beside it.

"Indeed, I'm doomed to this pit!" Luo Tian gazed at the familiar manure pit, cursing inwardly.

Yet soon he noticed the pit was clean, though emitting a foul odor—obviously completely dried.

"Good person! Who is this good person who emptied the pit!" Luo Tian almost cried.

"Aha, I remember! Those flies must have cleaned the Alchemy Hall!" Fu Xingxuan's face showed realization.

"Good people, they're all good people!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. Unexpectedly, Fu Xingxuan's slip of the tongue had such an effect.

"Then let's change location!" Fu Xingxuan's purple eyes gleamed, then she vanished with Luo Tian from the Alchemy Hall.

Throughout Xingyue Divine City, people were tense, awaiting the Thunder Roar Palace's activation. Most knew this would determine who became the next Divine Emperor.

Such a major event left no other matters. Yet Fu Xingyue, though excited about solving the contribution issue, felt some worry—excitement from resolving contributions, concern over Commander Fu Mengchen's absence.

"Second Prince, I've dispatched all Star Moon Guards to search for him, but found nothing!" Fu Zhiming addressed Fu Xingyue.

"Ah!" Fu Xingyue nodded solemnly, then sighed: "I hope he arrives in time!"

Luo Tian's combat power needed no explanation. With his help, Fu Xingyue's strength could rival the three brothers. Without Luo Tian, he'd barely match Fu Xingchen.

Time flowed steadily. Half a month passed. Fu Xingyue still hadn't heard from Luo Tian. Now he no longer cared if Luo Tian would return but worried about his safety.

Yet at this moment, Fu Xingyue's concern over Luo Tian was a man sitting beside a tall horse, holding a shovel, continuously scooping excrement.

"Monster! Monster!" Luo Tian inwardly panicked. He calculated the days—Fu Xingchen might recover soon.

"Otherwise, I'll have to escape!" Luo Tian sighed softly, looking at people surrounding him who pointed and sneered.

"Boy, this is the fate of angering Princess Xingxuan. Work hard! This horse is Princess Xingxuan's favorite—take care of it! There are over three thousand more. Don't dare to slack; we're all keeping track!" voices surrounded Luo Tian.

"Annoying bunch! Don't they eat or sleep?" Luo Tian inwardly cursed, watching each figure—escaping was difficult.

These two days, his manure scooping job had spread. So Fu Xingxuan's admirers volunteered to supervise Luo Tian, leaving no chance for escape.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian inwardly cursed, a strong roar echoed in everyone's ears, shaking the entire Xingyue Divine City.

"What's happening? Where did this sound come from?"

"Is it the Yun Star Palace? Has someone broken through?" People looked at the trembling sky with confusion.

"Breaking into Epoch Initial Stage?" Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion. He hadn't expected someone to break through now.

"It's the Third Prince! The Third Prince has broken into Epoch Initial Stage!" People immediately received the news, their faces showing shock.

Chapter 1315: Xingyue Divine Steed

With Fu Xingchen's breakthrough, the entire Xingyue Divine City trembled. Breaking through meant Fu Xingchen's injuries were fully recovered, implying the Thunder Roar Palace would open.

"I must leave. Otherwise all this effort is wasted!" Luo Tian's mind stirred, gazing at the people with impatience, thinking how to shake off these flies.

"Manure scooper! What are you daydreaming about? Get to work!" The man who Fu Xingyue had slapped earlier appeared beside Luo Tian, looking down at him with cruelty.

"Damn! They've blamed me!" Seeing the man's cruel gaze, Luo Tian knew this man had attributed Fu Xingyue's slap to him.

"Here... here... clean it all!" The man ordered Luo Tian with gestures, his eyes filled with contempt.

"Spit... spit..." The man spat twice in front of Luo Tian, pointing: "Oops, I dirtied it!"

"Oh, no problem. I'm just a manure scooper, so it doesn't matter!" Luo Tian was angered by the man's words, coldly addressing him.

"Ha..." As Luo Tian's words finished, people around laughed. Clearly, he was insulting the man as an animal.

"You insulted me?" The man's face turned fierce, addressing Luo Tian with coldness.

"I didn't insult you. I was insulting animals! What I said is true. You've always called me a manure scooper, so I'll just do it. Blame me?"

"Ha! Fu Yunpeng, you dare insult me? I think you're seeking death!" The man gazed at Luo Tian, finally finding a reason to attack. His whole body was excited.

"A lowly Saint Late Stage, dare to be arrogant before me? You think you're the Second Prince!" Fu Yunpeng's face was cold, his aura pressing onto Luo Tian.

At the same time, Fu Yunpeng summoned a holy force hand above Luo Tian's head. Wind blew, stirring Luo Tian's robe.

Yet Luo Tian seemed to ignore the hand above the sky, his face eerily calm, making Fu Yunpeng confused.

"Kid, still acting tough with me? Eat this pile of manure, and I'll spare your dog life!" Fu Yunpeng looked down at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn't respond to Fu Yunpeng but slowly stood up, walking toward him with a cold expression.

"Smack..." Next moment, a cold shovel struck Fu Yunpeng's face. The shovel was still covered with horse excrement.

People stared in shock at Luo Tian standing there, surprised he dared attack Fu Yunpeng.

"Vomit..." Soon after, people vomited, watching Fu Yunpeng standing there in a daze.

Luo Tian controlled his strength well—only pushing Fu Yunpeng back two steps, not knocking him down. Otherwise, a Saint Late Stage defeating a half-epoch would be too shocking.

Yet Fu Yunpeng didn't fall, but it was worse—he felt his face was wet, head dizzy. He touched it and his face turned grim.

Stinking, Fu Yunpeng's face was covered with excrement. His face darkened completely.

"Ah... I'll kill you!" Fu Yunpeng's body trembled, his filth spreading around. He rushed at Luo Tian with a punch.

This punch was truly deadly; anyone of Saint Late Stage would die. This was the confidence of a half-epoch.

Unfortunately, he met Luo Tian. Luo Tian seemed stunned, standing there with a smile, watching Fu Yunpeng.

"Is he paralyzed by Fu Yunpeng's aura?" People looked at Luo Tian, confused.

As Fu Yunpeng's hand was about to hit Luo Tian, a horse's neigh echoed. Next moment, a red lightning bolt appeared before Luo Tian. Two strong horse hooves slammed onto Fu Yunpeng's chest.

"Crack..." A breaking sound echoed. Fu Yunpeng's eyes showed disbelief, spitting blood as his chest caved in, falling before the crowd.

"Xiaohong, what are you doing? Your temper is too violent!" Luo Tian softly spoke, petting the tall horse beside him.

Entirely red, long flowing hair, standing high with a proud head. Its lively eyes showed disdain. It exhaled thick breaths, each part perfectly matched, muscles showing powerful strength, giving a soft and handsome appearance.

As Luo Tian continuously combed its hair, it obediently rubbed against him affectionately—this was Fu Xingxuan's favorite Xingyue Divine Steed, Qianli Xie.

"You..." Fu Yunpeng trembled, gazing at Qianli Xie beside Luo Tian, eyes filled with disbelief.

"How did he do it? Qianli Xie never allows strangers to touch, except Princess Xingxuan!" People looked at Luo Tian with confusion.

A neigh echoed. Other stables' Xingyue Divine Steeds immediately neighed, their big eyes full of anger watching Fu Yunpeng.

"This..." Fu Yunpeng was stunned, the first time encountering such a situation.

"Go! But don't dirty your feet. If you do, I won't help clean it!" Luo Tian lightly patted Qianli Xie's body, speaking softly.

"Neigh..." Qianli Xie neighed once, lifting its two front hooves and rushing at Fu Yunpeng as a red lightning bolt.

"Crack..." Next moment, dust rose. Breaking sounds echoed in people's ears, making their mouths twitch.

"Get out and move around!" Luo Tian pointed, opening all stables. A series of powerful Xingyue Divine Steeds immediately neighed, surrounding everyone.

"This damn..." Those who had supervised Luo Tian before changed faces. They hadn't expected Luo Tian could command these Xingyue Divine Steeds.

These Xingyue Divine Steeds, though appearing like horses, were far stronger than ordinary beasts or royal families. They weren't anyone's match. Seeing Fu Yunpeng's fate, they knew.

"Enough!" Luo Tian saw enough and softly spoke to Qianli Xie, who was still acting like in heat.

"Step on him again, and you'll kill him!" Luo Tian smiled, looking at Qianli Xie returning obediently. He glanced at Fu Yunpeng lying on the ground, barely alive.

"It's really troublesome!" Luo Tian picked up a large iron shovel, approached Fu Yunpeng, scooped him up, and threw him into the manure pit.

"Damn! It's so satisfying!" Luo Tian inwardly felt good, smiling at the crowd: "Who else dislikes me? Just attack!"

"Damn! That's Fu Yunpeng! He was thrown into the manure pit! My god!" People opened their mouths, watching Fu Yunpeng sinking. Their hearts trembled; they wanted to save him but were too disgusted.

"I have something else, so I'll take my leave!" A youth looked at the crowd's angry eyes and spoke softly.

"Aha, I do too. Let's go together!" Others also spoke, looking at Luo Tian with admiration. No one in Xingyue Divine City had ever thrown Fu Yunpeng into the pit, not even the three princes.

But now they wanted to leave,却被 a series of Xingyue Divine Steeds surrounding them, like humans, glaring at these people.

"From now on, don't bother me!" Luo Tian coldly spoke. Though a Saint Late Stage, his aura suppressed them.

"Okay!" Each admirer knew they weren't Luo Tian's match. With Xingyue Divine Steeds helping, few could capture Luo Tian.

Luo Tian put his hands to his mouth and whistled. Those handsome Xingyue Divine Steeds obediently returned to their stables.

"Go!" Everyone sighed deeply, looking at Fu Yunpeng sinking into the pit. They disappeared from Luo Tian's sight.

"Finally free! If I didn't show them my strength, they wouldn't know. Even without power, I can still play with them!" Luo Tian inwardly sneered, smiling at Qianli Xie's massive body: "Calling you Xiaohong is better. Why call you Qianli Xie? It's too eerie! You did well, here's this elixir for you!"

Luo Tian handed an elixir to Qianli Xie's mouth. The horse's big eyes showed satisfaction, gently rubbing Luo Tian before walking to the corner.

"Fu Xingxuan, you..." Luo Tian was about to continue cursing but suddenly changed tone.

"You are the greatest person in the world! Knowing I like horses, you sent me here. Truly insightful!" Luo Tian's eyes showed gratitude, speaking loudly.

"You just said Qianli Xie's name is bad?" Luo Tian hadn't finished speaking when Fu Xingxuan's voice echoed. A purple-clad Fu Xingxuan appeared before Luo Tian.

Chapter 1316: Thunder Roar Palace Opens

"How could it be? Qianli Xie's name is so good! I didn't say it, you did!" Luo Tian swore, pointing at the manure pit with a furious face.

"Pu..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, Qianli Xie exhaled a thick breath, its eyes showing disdain.

"Neigh..." Other Xingyue Divine Steeds also neighed, their eyes showing human-like disdain as they glanced at Luo Tian.

"Xiao Ding, I'll kill you!" Before Luo Tian's words finished, the stench rose from the manure pit. Fu Yunpeng jumped out, spitting liquid.

"Vomit! Get out!" Fu Xingxuan's face turned pale. She had never seen such a disgusting scene. She forced herself to suppress the urge to vomit, glaring at Luo Tian.

"Seems you're quite comfortable here!" Fu Xingxuan observed Luo Tian, her eyes showing a dangerous gaze.

"Doing my duty for the Princess is my responsibility!" Luo Tian quickly straightened his back, smiling sycophantically and patting his chest.

"Enough. Come with me! There's a new mission!" Fu Xingxuan sneered, her eyes showing a hint of triumph.

"This girl has another plan to torment me! I must escape this time. Time is short!" Luo Tian inwardly muttered, addressing Fu Xingxuan: "Your Highness, what do you wish to say?"

"The Thunder Roar Palace is opening. Come with me to play!" Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, her gaze complex.

Hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Luo Tian was stunned. He hadn't expected her to invite him to the Thunder Roar Palace.

"Your Highness, I know entering the Thunder Roar Palace requires a million contributions. I have none!" Luo Tian quickly spoke, not wanting to accompany Fu Xingxuan into the Thunder Roar Palace.

"Hmph. In Xingyue Divine City, what can't I do?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Fu Xingyue smiled, waving her hand. Light spread, and the Xingyue Divine Seal appeared in Luo Tian's sight.

"Do you know what this is? The Xingyue Divine Seal. With this token, even without contributions, I can enter the Thunder Roar Palace freely, and even bring two companions!" Fu Xingxuan boasted to Luo Tian.

"Damn! Why didn't you say earlier!" Luo Tian inwardly cursed, regretful. He also had a Xingyue Divine Seal but hadn't realized its power was so great—allowing free entry into the Thunder Roar Palace.

"Should have snuck in myself!" Luo Tian felt deep regret, but it was too late. His eyes showed reverence: "Your Highness is truly unique; even obtaining the Xingyue Divine Seal!"

"What's unique? Grandpa Fu Tianqing gave another to an annoying person!" Upon mentioning the Xingyue Divine Seal, Fu Xingxuan gritted her teeth, thinking of an annoying face.

"That annoying person is right here. Bite me if you want!" Luo Tian saw Fu Xingxuan's teeth gritting and inwardly delighted.

"If I meet that person who annoyed you, I'll definitely bring him to your feet!" Luo Tian swore earnestly, lying.

"Good. Hope you keep your promise!" Fu Xingxuan looked at Luo Tian with deep meaning, imagining capturing Fu Mengchen and having Xiao Ding, the former subordinate, teach his commander.

"The Thunder Roar Palace will open in three hours. Those with a million contributions may enter. Hurry!" As Fu Xingxuan's words finished, Fu Tianba's voice echoed across Xingyue Divine City, shaking it.

"Finally opening!" Everyone rushed toward the Thunder Roar Palace to see the three princes' strength.

"So fast!" Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan were stunned. Fu Xingchen had just broken through, yet Fu Tianba announced the Thunder Roar Palace's opening.

"Let's go. Don't let your brothers wait!" Fu Xingxuan grabbed Luo Tian and vanished.

"Thank you all for your trouble," Fu Xingyang stood in his courtyard, looking at four Epoch Initial Stage masters and five half-epoch masters. He spoke softly.

"Great Prince, we've bet everything on you. Naturally, we'll do our best!" An old man spoke, his voice showing reverence.

"Fu Xingyue, I won't lose to you this time!" Fu Xingchen's face was dark, his eyes showing confidence as he looked at the three Epoch Initial Stage masters. Especially when looking at an old man in gray robes, his eyes glowed.

"Still didn't wait for me. After I enter, you must continue searching for the commander!" Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, instructing his Star Moon Guards.

Thunder Roar Palace...

Crowds filled the area. People in Xingyue Divine City wore expectant expressions, knowing this would determine who ruled the city.

Fu Xingyue's three brothers appeared simultaneously, causing people to show reverence.

"Great Prince's strength is still the strongest!" People sighed, looking at Fu Xingyang's direction.

"Hey? I thought Second Prince's strength could match Great Prince's, but where is your useless commander?"

"Such a lot!" Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen looked at Fu Xingyue's direction, surprised to see three Epoch Initial Stage masters and three half-epoch masters behind him. They had thought only Fu Xingyue and Commander Fu Mengchen would come, as per their understanding that Fu Xingyue's side had only two with over a million contributions.

"Little brother, you do have some skills!" Fu Xingyang rubbed his chin, smiling as he surveyed Fu Xingyue and the three Epoch Initial Stage elders behind him.

"You useless commander!" Fu Xingchen was more direct. He remembered the humiliation he suffered under Luo Tian's command. Now that he had entered Epoch Initial Stage, he longed to find Luo Tian for revenge.

"He has something else. He's out!" Fu Xingyue sighed inwardly, his eyes showing a smile as he led the group to face them.

"Second Brother, without that commander, your strength isn't much!" Fu Xingchen smiled, looking at Fu Xingyue with a sinister gaze.

"Boom..." As Fu Xingchen's sinister words finished, Fu Xingxuan smiled and led Luo Tian out of the crowd.

"You three have no end!" Fu Xingxuan showed impatience, approaching her third brother.

Seeing Fu Xingxuan's group, their faces changed instantly to indulgent expressions. Even the usually gloomy Fu Xingyang softened slightly, patting Fu Xingxuan's head: "What are you doing here?"

"I was ordered by the Emperor to supervise you!" Fu Xingxuan stuck out her tongue, playfully grabbing Fu Xingyang's hand and shaking it.

"Ridiculous. Be good, go back. The Thunder Roar Palace seems harmless, but it's not a place for you!" Fu Xingyue's face darkened, scolding Fu Xingxuan.

The three brothers unanimously agreed for the first time, nodding to Fu Xingxuan.

"Isn't there you? You'll protect me, right?" Fu Xingxuan used her secret weapon, gazing at the three with teary eyes.

"No!" The three shook their heads, determined not to let Fu Xingxuan enter and not want her to witness their fight.

But Fu Xingxuan kept gazing at them with teary eyes, showing determination to refuse.

"Enough. I'm scared of you! Follow Third Brother later; he'll protect you!" Fu Xingchen was the first to give in. He and Fu Xingxuan were almost the same age, naturally spoiling her most.

"Old Third, don't be foolish!" Fu Xingyue frowned at Fu Xingchen.

"Without ability, I'll protect her!" Fu Xingchen's eyes showed provocation toward Fu Xingyue.

"Okay, then each of us will assign one Epoch Initial Stage master to protect Fu Xingxuan. That should be fine!" Fu Xingyang thought thoroughly, addressing the two.

"Good!" Both nodded. They looked back and quickly assigned people to protect Fu Xingxuan.

"These three brothers truly spoil Fu Xingxuan," Luo Tian stood behind Fu Xingxuan, sighing.

"Thunder Roar Palace! Open!" As the three finished their agreement, Fu Tianba's voice echoed in everyone's ears.

At the same time, Thunder Roar Palace's door slowly opened. In an instant, thunder energy surged out, striking everyone.

"Three of you! If anything happens to Fu Xingxuan, I'll take your entire family's lives!" Fu Xingyang gazed at the three Epoch Initial Stage masters assigned to protect Fu Xingxuan, his voice deep.

"Yes!" The three masters bowed respectfully, their eyes showing reverence.
