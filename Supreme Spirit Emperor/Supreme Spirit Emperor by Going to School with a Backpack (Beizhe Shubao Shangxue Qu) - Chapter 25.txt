Gazing upon the dark, lustrous Soul-Calling Bell, its intricate patterns, worn by time, seemed as if they had been eroded into oblivion. Recalling the old man’s words, Luo Tian could not fathom that this ancient bell, with such a long history, was actually a grade-one weapon.

Gu Yun gently caressed the bell’s surface, gazing upon this artifact that had accompanied the Gu family through its rise and decline. A trace of remorse flickered across his face as he murmured, “Gu Yun, I am sorry to the ancestors of our family. I have failed to restore the Gu clan’s former glory, instead watching it further decline!”

As Gu Yun lightly caressed the Soul-Calling Bell, it emitted a thunderous clang. A dark radiance continuously emanated from the bell’s body, enveloping everyone in an ancient and distant aura.

Luo Tian felt as if he were immersed in a battlefield of blood-soaked waves, his body entangled by countless tormented souls. A chill ran through him.

Others naturally sensed the bell’s transformation. Shangguan Fei’s expression remained calm as he observed the Soul-Calling Bell, murmuring, “Indeed, this Soul-Calling Bell is a grade-one weapon. After so many years, it has even self-repaired. Its current aura suggests it can unleash fifty percent of a grade-one weapon’s power!”

“Then we are in quite the predicament, aren’t we?” The young man who had initially been caught off guard by Gu Lei’s poison attack, having now expelled the toxin from his body, observed the bell with a heavy heart. “This pressure it exerts on me is overwhelming.”

“Hmph. If it were at full strength, I would be wary of it. But merely fifty percent? It’s still a dream to stop me. Moreover, among those present, none are more than the Refining Body Stage—what power could they possibly draw from this bell?” Shangguan Fei scoffed.

“I am only at the ninth stage of Refining Body, insufficient to activate the Soul-Calling Bell. But I vowed that even if I die, I would not let you take my two children!” Gu Yun coldly snorted.

He turned his head, gazing deeply at Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei with a gentle yet heart-wrenching expression. Then, he cast one last glance at Luo Tian before murmuring, “Remember my request!”

After speaking, Gu Yun, under the cries of Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, slammed his hands into his dantian.

The dantian was the most crucial part of a cultivator; shattering it meant all their cultivated energy would dissipate.

Yet, among the world’s people, there were always prodigies who devised various secret techniques. The ancestors of the Gu family had once pioneered a method to shatter one’s dantian, amplifying their power exponentially—perhaps even a hundredfold—just before the energy dispersed.

“Shattering the Dan and Coalescing Qi! Gu Yun, are you truly mad?” Shangguan Fei realized what Gu Yun intended and shouted loudly. Yet he did not stop him, clearly indifferent to Gu Yun’s life.

Luo Tian knew this act would demand an immense sacrifice, but seeing the pleading look in Gu Yun’s eyes, he hesitated.

Though Luo Tian paused, someone else intervened to stop Gu Yun—two aged hands intercepted him just before his hands struck the dantian.

“Shangguan Fei, it’s been years. Do you still remember me?” Tian Bo’s aged voice echoed as his hunched figure stood before Gu Yun.

Seeing Tian Bo’s form appear before him, Gu Yun looked at him with a grim expression: “Tian Bo… you…”

“Let me deal with this old body first!” Before Gu Yun could speak further, Tian Bo’s aged voice replied.

“Tian Yangtian?” Shangguan Fei, seeing the hunched figure, displayed disbelief.

“Indeed, it is I.” Tian Bo’s face bore no expression, his tone cold and indifferent.

“Did you survive that battle?” Shangguan Fei pointed at Tian Bo, speechless with shock.

“Is Tian Bo strong?” Luo Tian was puzzled, turning to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. “I don’t know much about him. I only know he was already in the Gu family before I was born. He raised us all, and for years, he has never shown his power. His aura is absent; to us, he seems like a mere grandfather.” Gu Qianxue murmured.

Luo Tian gazed at the Soul-Calling Bell and then at Tian Bo beside Gu Yun, sighing inwardly: “It seems the Gu family was never ordinary. But what reason caused such a powerful clan to fall into this state? And what kind of family is the Shangguan clan, that Gu Yun holds such resentment toward it?”

“Merely侥幸 (luckily) survived. However, I bear hidden injuries; my cultivation has regressed significantly.” As Luo Tian pondered, Tian Bo’s aged voice echoed, as if answering Shangguan Fei.

Upon hearing of Tian Bo’s injury, Shangguan Fei observed his current state and believed his words. A joyous expression spread across his face, for he had heard of Tian Yangtian’s might in the past.

At that time, the Gu family was at its zenith, with Tian Yangtian accompanying the clan’s patriarch who had dominated the northern domain and even gained fame across the Tianyuan Continent.

Now, Tian Yangtian bore no resemblance to his former self—no longer the mighty and imposing figure he once was, but merely an elderly man on the brink of death.

Thinking this, Shangguan Fei’s lips curled into a faint smile: “Tian Yangtian, I suppose you are no more than ten percent of your former self?”

“Though not as strong as ten percent, I can still stop you,” Tian Bo murmured, his aged face displaying confidence.

He extended his hands, dry palms striking various meridians across his body. With each strike, his aura grew stronger, and his hunched form gradually straightened.

“Refining Body First Stage… Refining Body Ninth Stage… Bone-Transformation Initial Phase…” Within less than twenty breaths, Tian Bo’s aura surged to the peak of Bone-Transformation.

At this moment, Tian Bo stood upright, his face still aged but his eyes now bore the cold gaze of an eagle.

“Hmph, merely reaching Bone-Transformation’s peak. Don’t forget, I am at the Soul-Elemental Stage!” Shangguan Fei’s face was serious, though his aura suggested he still feared the former Tian Yangtian.

“Then, what about this?” Tian Bo extended his hand and lifted the heavy Soul-Calling Bell.

Chapter 117: Battle ()

Chapter 117: Battle

Tian Bo’s words had barely faded when the Soul-Calling Bell emitted a deep resonance, spinning in midair. As it rotated, its massive body shrank before the onlookers’ eyes, landing in Tian Bo’s withered hands.

“Old comrade, I didn’t think you still recognized me!” Tian Bo’s eyes carried a nostalgic glimmer as he gently caressed the Soul-Calling Bell in his palm.

“Wu…,” the bell responded with a deep hum, as if greeting an old comrade.

Seeing Tian Bo lift the bell, Shangguan Fei’s usual contemptuous gaze first turned solemn.

If it were merely Tian Bo, he would have been confident in defeating him. But with the grade-one Soul-Calling Bell at his side, even he felt uneasy. After all, a grade-one weapon had transcended the realm of ordinary weapons and could threaten him directly.

“Gu Yun, take Qianxue and Luo Tian away. I will handle this!” Tian Bo’s figure stood before the group.

Though his body was frail, in the eyes of everyone present, it seemed towering—this weak form could indeed support a sky.

“Tian Bo!” Gu Yun gazed at Tian Bo with sorrow, recalling how the remaining old and infirm of the Gu family had survived thanks to this elder. It was then that Tian Bo had suffered a grievous injury, dragging his wounded body to Tianyuan City.

“Leave now!” Tian Bo’s face turned serious as he barked at Gu Yun in a low voice.

“Think you can escape?” Shangguan Fei’s face darkened, his cold words echoing. His two companions also stared at the Gu family with eyes like wolves eyeing their prey.

“I will hold them back—make haste, I cannot last long!” Tian Bo’s voice resonated within Gu Yun’s mind through a mental imprint.

Hearing Tian Bo’s mental transmission, Gu Yun trembled, gazing deeply at the elder standing before them. He bowed deeply, clenched his teeth, and turned to lead the Gu family away.

“I said you can’t escape!” Shangguan Fei’s face twisted with menace, vanishing from his spot. The world seemed to lose him entirely.

Yet Tian Bo merely chuckled: “Let me see what abilities you’ve gained in the Soul-Elemental Stage over these years!”

With a flick of his hands, the Soul-Calling Bell soared into the air. A thunderous clang echoed outward, and a powerful mental force radiated from Tian Bo’s body.

Tian Bo, at the peak of Bone-Transformation, formed a golden fist and launched it toward the sky.

This punch seemed to tear through space itself, emitting a terrifying tremor as it hurtled toward the hidden Shangguan Fei above.

Shangguan Fei, sensing his discovery, retaliated with a punch—his specialty was earth-element defense.

The clash erupted in a deafening roar, and as night had fallen, the sky over Tianyuan City blazed with brilliant light, illuminating it like daylight.

“Old fool, you truly are persistent!” Shangguan Fei muttered, his face dark as he watched Luo Tian and the others recede. “You two—what are you waiting for? Go retrieve those people immediately!”

Seeing his two grandsons still staring in bewilderment, Shangguan Fei grew furious.

“Yes!” They quickly responded and vanished into a blur, appearing before Luo Tian’s group.

“Return!” Seeing the two young men pursuing Luo Tian’s group, Tian Bo’s face darkened. He bellowed and extended a golden hand to intercept them.

“Hmph, old fool, your opponent is me!” Shangguan Fei scoffed and intercepted Tian Bo. The golden hand vanished into the void.

Tian Bo’s gaze sharpened; he knew he could not stop those two young men. He sighed inwardly and turned, lifting the Soul-Calling Bell. Two pure white wings sprouted from his back—yet they were not the ethereal wings of a Soul-Elemental Stage cultivator, but instead shimmered with metallic luster.

“Hmph, old fool, I didn’t expect you to possess even the Aurora Wings!” Shangguan Fei’s face bore admiration as he gazed at Tian Bo’s metallic wings, his eyes filled with greed.

Wings of this kind were rare on the Tianyuan Continent, their value immense. Even Shangguan Fei, at the early stage of Soul-Elemental, would feel reluctant to purchase such a weapon.

Ordinary Soul-Elemental Stage cultivators rarely bought these wings, and only those with immense wealth in the Bone-Transformation Stage could afford them.

The Aurora Wings allowed non-Soul-Elemental cultivators to fly through the skies, serving as a life-saving tool for Bone-Transformation Stage warriors. Naturally, these wings also possessed some offensive capabilities, but their greatest feature—flight—overshadowed this.

Tian Bo ignored Shangguan Fei’s admiration and murmured, “Come with me to the skies for a battle!”

“You still have compassion? Fine, I’ll grant you that. After all, you were once a great warrior. To kill such a strong opponent is truly an honor for me!” Shangguan Fei’s face bore excitement.

“Hmph, if I were at my peak, one strike would be enough to kill you!” Tian Bo’s face bore a wry smile, yet his words radiated boundless arrogance.

“If I were at my peak, I wouldn’t even think of fighting you—I’d turn and run. Unfortunately, you are no longer the Tian Yangtian I once knew, nor am I the Shangguan Fei of yesteryear!” Shangguan Fei’s eyes flashed with hatred.

“You spared my life back then, but it has brought great trouble to the Gu family now!” Tian Bo’s face bore nostalgia and regret.

Yet Shangguan Fei’s ears caught these words like thunder, his face shifting rapidly until he even panted heavily.

“You’ve hidden your actions well, but your current gaze has betrayed you! You still carry the same coldness in your eyes!” Tian Bo spoke coldly.

“Hmph, now that you know, it’s too late. You’ll die today regardless!” Shangguan Fei’s face twisted with menace, his desire to kill Tian Bo now beyond words.

Tian Bo snorted and, with the Aurora Wings flaring, vanished from sight. He appeared in the skies of Tianyuan City with the Soul-Calling Bell in hand, while Shangguan Fei materialized before him, brandishing a long sword.

The clash erupted in a deafening roar, and the explosive force from their battle illuminated Tianyuan City like daylight.

Yet Luo Tian’s group had no time to admire the spectacle of a Soul-Elemental Stage battle. Two young men, their cultivation at Bone-Transformation, stood before them with smirks. One of them glared at Gu Lei with fury.

Chapter 118: Re-Battle Against Bone-Transformation ()

Chapter 118: Re-Battle Against Bone-Transformation

The Bone-Transformation Stage stood like an insurmountable barrier before the Gu family.

Luo Tian glanced at the two young men, roughly a few years older than himself, yet their cultivation had already reached Bone-Transformation. This made him feel immense pressure.

Luo Tian considered himself to have a fast cultivation rate—twenty years old and at the ninth stage of Refining Body. This was due to his role as a alchemist and his Five-Element Body, combined with various coincidences.

But seeing their youthful faces, Luo Tian longed to ask: “What did you eat to grow so fast?”

“Lord Gu, let’s fight them!” Several热血 (passionate) members of the Gu family shouted.

“Right! The Gu family has no cowards!” As these passionate members cried out, the hundreds of Gu family members all shouted in unison.

Gu Yun’s face bore both satisfaction and sorrow as he heard the group’s cries. He knew that against these two Bone-Transformation young men, his people—only at Refining Body fourth or fifth stage—would be no match for even one of their fingers.

Gu Yun’s gaze fell upon Luo Tian, clearly seeing no better solution. If he had used the previously unutilized Shattering the Dan and Coalescing Qi technique, there might have been a chance.

But seeing Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei watching him intently, he abandoned the thought. He knew he was no match for these two children and would be stopped by them.

As Gu Yun’s gaze fell on Luo Tian, the other members of the Gu family also turned their eyes toward him. Their gazes lit up—Luo Tian had become the object of admiration for all within the Gu family, having achieved countless miracles before them.

Luo Tian felt the intense stares and sighed inwardly. If he could leave one of his two brothers behind, this situation would be resolved.

Thinking this through, Luo Tian’s mind cleared: “It seems I’ve been living under the shadow of my older brothers. Over-relying on them, though things have gone smoothly so far, I now feel the weight of adversity.”

Understanding this, Luo Tian’s face bore a decisive expression. This time, he would confront the crisis himself.

Luo Tian turned to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei behind him, murmuring: “I’ll hold one back; the other you two handle!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Gu Yun felt gratitude. Though the Gu family had done him a favor, Luo Tian could have withdrawn but chose to stand with them.

“Good!” Gu Yun nodded, knowing there was no other option. He called out loudly: “We will fight to the death with the Gu family!”

It was unclear who initiated the cry, but soon all members of the Gu family—men and women alike—shouted in unison. Their faces bore a resolute, death-defying aura, their battle spirit reaching for the heavens.

Luo Tian stepped forward toward the two young men. He suddenly accelerated, his aura unyielding. His hands moved swiftly, and three elements collided within him—forming a light-element attribute.

A dazzling white light radiated from Luo Tian’s body, even causing the two Bone-Transformation young men to feel their eyes sting. They sensed a terrifying seal descending upon them from above.

The young man, seeing Luo Tian wrapped in six colors of attributes, displayed shock: “Six elements!”

Yet the other young man smiled cruelly: “Hunting prodigies is my favorite. Qingyu, the rest are yours. I’ll take this kid—so long since I’ve killed a prodigy, and such an elite one is truly exciting. Kid, remember—your killer is Shangguan Qingfeng!”

Shangguan Qingfeng informed his brother, Shangguan Qingyu, before turning to Luo Tian with a sinister smile. He ignored the blinding light and stared fiercely, launching a punch toward the Five-Element Birth Human Seal in the sky.

“Peng…” A violent surge of energy erupted from above, and though Luo Tian had prepared for it, he was still startled. His Human Seal was shattered by a single punch from the Bone-Transformation elder.

Though shocked, Luo Tian rushed toward Shangguan Qingfeng, his fists wrapped in six elements, striking directly at Shangguan Qingfeng’s chest.

Seeing Luo Tian’s fists aimed at his chest, Shangguan Qingfeng wore a playful smile and did not dodge. Instead, he let his chest meet Luo Tian’s fist head-on.

When Luo Tian saw Shangguan Qingfeng’s smile, he felt something was amiss. But his fist had already surged forward and could not be收回 (retracted).

“Peng!” Luo Tian felt his fist had not struck Shangguan Qingfeng but instead hit himself. A burning sensation spread across his chest.

Luo Tian was thrown backward, spitting blood uncontrollably, his face flushed with red.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei cried out in alarm, surprised that Luo Tian had already been so battered within three breaths.

They rushed toward Luo Tian, but a pale figure stood before them, especially with an icy gaze at Gu Lei.

“You seem to have forgotten my presence!” Shangguan Qingyu raised his hand and pressed down on the three of them.

The three did not hesitate, immediately summoning their martial arts to defend.

Luo Tian slowly rose, his face filled with disbelief. He could not fathom that his punch—certainly hitting—had rebounded onto himself.

Seeming to understand Luo Tian’s confusion, Shangguan Qingfeng smiled: “Kid, strange? You should know Bone-Transformation elders possess bone cores, right?”

Upon hearing Shangguan Qingfeng’s words, Luo Tian suddenly understood. He knew Bone-Transformation elders had bone cores and mused: “Ah, his bone core is the sternum. His ability is to rebound others’ attacks?”

Luo Tian marveled at the bone core’s marvel and rushed toward Shangguan Qingfeng again. He knew if he did not act first, taking advantage of Shangguan Qingfeng’s carelessness, he would have no chance to strike.

Shangguan Qingfeng watched Luo Tian charging like a tiger and smiled faintly. He loved to let these prodigies attack him fully until they exhausted themselves, then watch their despair.

He left his chest exposed again, and the familiar light flared once more. Shangguan Qingfeng saw Luo Tian still using the same tactic and smirked: “Idiot!”

Chapter 119: I Will Go With You ()

Chapter 119: I Will Go With You

Luo Tian unleashed the Human Seal again, but it was shattered by Shangguan Qingfeng. At this moment, Luo Tian’s body approached Shangguan Qingfeng again, his fists wrapped in six elements, striking directly at Shangguan Qingfeng’s chest.

“Unexpectedly, you seem smart but still so foolish!” Shangguan Qingfeng sneered and let Luo Tian’s fist strike his chest.

But as Luo Tian saw Shangguan Qingfeng’s mocking gaze, he wore a serene smile. His fist’s energy abruptly stopped, and his other hand pushed toward Shangguan Qingfeng’s face.

“Soul-Stealing Seal!” Luo Tian roared, his hand radiating a terrifying mental force that struck Shangguan Qingfeng’s face.

Shangguan Qingfeng did not expect Luo Tian to have such a technique. His face flickered with surprise, but then his expression turned furious. His head was struck directly by the Soul-Stealing Seal and he flew backward, still displaying shock.

“Soul-Stealing Seal!” Luo Tian’s strongest martial technique—even Lei Yongjie had felt his arms numb. How much more so for Shangguan Qingfeng, who was inferior to Lei Yongjie. And it was his head that had been attacked.

As Shangguan Qingfeng flew backward, the Cracking Heaven Spear appeared in Luo Tian’s hand instantly. He channeled his energy and the spear rushed toward the most vulnerable part of a human body—its eyes.

This all happened in an instant, and as Luo Tian gained the upper hand, the Gu family erupted with a deafening cheer.

Yet an astonishing scene unfolded: as the Cracking Heaven Spear was about to pierce Shangguan Qingfeng’s eyes, Shangguan Qingfeng—still dazed—suddenly opened his eyes. His white hands instantly blocked the spear’s path.

“Unexpectedly, you are quite resourceful! You truly are a five-element prodigy!” Shangguan Qingfeng licked his lips, his face twisted with menace. After a brief exchange, he clearly knew Luo Tian’s light-element attribute was not innate.

Shangguan Qingfeng had become enraged, thoroughly furious. Even if he met a Bone-Transformation mid-stage elder, he could barely fight. Yet now, facing a Refining Body ninth stage Five-Element Body cultivator, he had bled—this was an insult to his pride.

The Gu family watched this scene and their cheers abruptly ceased, faces filled with despair. They had not expected Luo Tian’s powerful attack to only wound Shangguan Qingfeng slightly.

Luo Tian’s face darkened, and he tried to pull back the spear but could not move it.

Shangguan Qingfeng, with a fierce push, sent the spear back toward Luo Tian. At this moment, he no longer concealed his power—Bone-Transformation early stage energy fully unleashed, clearly annoyed by Luo Tian’s endless tricks.

The Cracking Heaven Spear emitted a mournful cry, and in Luo Tian’s astonished gaze, the spear—normally firmly held by him—suddenly flew from his hand and shot back toward him.

“Puo!” Luo Tian’s shoulder burst out a cloud of blood, the spear piercing through it.

Luo Tian coughed up more blood, his face pale.

“Too strong!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, the coldness from his wound spreading through him, making him more alert.

The Gu family members saw Luo Tian coughing blood and turned to look at the battle between Gu Qianxue, three others, and Shangguan Qingyu. Their faces changed drastically.

The situation of the three was no better than Luo Tian’s; all had blood trickling from their mouths, staining their clothes red. Especially Gu Lei, perhaps due to the previous ambush by Gu Lei, Shangguan Qingyu had given him special attention.

At this moment, Gu Lei’s face was ashen; his arms slowly lowered, relying only on his feet to evade attacks. But how could one evade Bone-Transformation attacks? Occasionally, he would be struck by a palm—this was only because Shangguan Qingyu did not wish to kill them. Otherwise, they would already be corpses.

“Kill!” Someone cried out in despair and rushed toward Shangguan Qingyu.

But the elder, just returning halfway, was stopped by Gu Yun’s shout. Clearly, Gu Yun did not wish to add more casualties to the Gu family.

Luo Tian’s mental force spread out and naturally sensed this situation. His face bore a moment of struggle as he took out a black pearl from his storage ring.

As the black pearl appeared, the entire battlefield was filled with a cold killing intent, even Luo Tian himself shivered involuntarily.

“Slaughter Pearl!” Shangguan Qingfeng, seeing the black pearl in Luo Tian’s hand, displayed a serious expression. But it quickly turned to fervor.

Even Shangguan Qingyu stopped his attack on Gu Qianxue and the others, his face filled with greed as he gazed at Luo Tian’s Slaughter Pearl.

The Slaughter Pearl was refined from killing intent. If one could refine the energy and slaughter intent within it, it would be a great boon for cultivators. However, this came with immense risks—mistakenly refining it could turn one into a slaughter machine.

“Kid, hand over the Slaughter Pearl to me, and I’ll spare your life!” Shangguan Qingfeng’s face was filled with fervor, offering a deal to Luo Tian.

The Slaughter Pearl’s allure was too great for him. Feeling such a dense slaughter intent, Shangguan Qingfeng could sense that if he refined it, his long-standing Bone-Transformation mid-stage stagnation would be resolved.

Hearing Shangguan Qingfeng’s demand, the Gu family members’ faces changed repeatedly. If Luo Tian truly agreed, then the Gu family would have no hope left. Yet they also hoped he would agree, hoping Luo Tian could survive and avenge the Gu family in the future.

“Luo Tian, agree to it!” The Gu family members all cried out, weighing the pros and cons. They still hoped Luo Tian would agree, for with his talent, he would surely become renowned across the Tianyuan Continent within a decade. They knew Luo Tian’s character and believed he would definitely avenge the Gu family.

“Enough, kid. Give me the Slaughter Pearl quickly. At your current state, refining it is tantamount to suicide!” Shangguan Qingfeng urged.

“Hmph, do you think I’m a three-year-old child? If I truly gave it to you, with your cold nature, you’d immediately betray me!” Luo Tian scoffed.

After saying this, he slowly moved the Slaughter Pearl toward his forehead.

“You dare!” Shangguan Qingfeng roared and rushed toward Luo Tian, but his voice was drowned out by a woman’s voice. This also made Shangguan Qingfeng stop in his tracks.

“I will go with you!” Gu Qianxue’s trembling voice echoed, her face bearing a tragic expression.

Chapter 120: Heartbreak ()

Chapter 120: Heartbreak

Luo Tian’s action halted as he turned to look at Gu Qianxue.

Seeing the scene before him, Luo Tian was also stunned.

At this moment, Gu Yun’s face was red as Shangguan Qingyu choked him in the air, struggling desperately. Shangguan Qingyu’s hands were tightening.

“Let go of my father! I’ll go with you!” Gu Qianxue shouted at the struggling Gu Yun.

“I’ll also go with you! Let go of my father!” Seeing Gu Yun’s increasingly desperate face, Gu Lei also shouted.

But in the moment Luo Tian was stunned, Shangguan Qingfeng could not miss this opportunity. His figure moved like a ghost and appeared before Luo Tian instantly, his foot striking downward.

Luo Tian was unprepared; the Slaughter Pearl flew from his hand, and he was thrown backward like a kite, falling to the ground in a pitiful heap.

Luo Tian tried to get up but was struck by a Bone-Transformation early stage elder’s full power. Without any defense, it was miraculous he had survived. He coughed up more blood and struggled to rise but clearly was at his limit.

Shangguan Qingfeng held the Slaughter Pearl in his hand, a joyous expression on his face. He continuously bounced it in his palm, his eyes mocking as he gazed at Luo Tian: “Kid, how dare you divert your attention while fighting me?”

“Are you sure?” Shangguan Qingyu asked Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei after hearing their cries, slightly loosening his grip on Gu Yun.

Gu Yun’s face bore sorrow; he wished to die rather than let his children sacrifice their freedom for his life.

Though he could not speak, Gu Lei’s eyes begged Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei to refuse. The meaning was clear—do not let them compromise.

But could Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei agree? The answer was obvious.

At this moment, the battlefield in the sky also reached its conclusion; the terrifying energy finally subsided. The dark sky seemed to have been pierced open.

A hunched figure fell from the sky at incredible speed, his entire body surrounded by flames. He landed before the group.

“Tian Bo!” The Gu family members cried out, rushing to his side and shouting loudly.

Luo Tian was also assisted by the Gu family members into the crowd, joining them at Tian Bo’s side. Seeing Tian Bo lying unconscious on the ground, he sighed.

Through mental force, Luo Tian could clearly sense Tian Bo’s life energy diminishing rapidly. His meridians were now intricately entangled, clearly severely injured. Tian Bo had already been wounded before; his current state was sustained only by secret techniques. This injury was a fatal blow, and without timely treatment, he would not survive.

“Qianxue, quickly transfer your wood-element energy to Tian Bo!” Luo Tian hurriedly called out, rushing toward the dazed Gu Qianxue.

Hearing Luo Tian’s call, Gu Qianxue rushed to Tian Bo’s side and unconditionally transferred her wood-element energy into his body.

“Peng…” Shangguan Fei’s figure landed firmly before the group, his breath labored but a triumphant expression on his face.

“Hmph… Tian Yangtian, I never thought you would fall at my hands!” Shangguan Fei roared.

“Third Uncle, Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei have agreed to return with us to the Yelang Sect. How should we deal with these people?” Shangguan Qingfeng asked Shangguan Fei.

“Ah? You’ve finally seen reason? Why not just settle this peacefully? Why make it so bloody?” The three looked down at the Gu family members, as if viewing them as ants.

The Gu family members remained silent, their eyes filled with endless fury. If looks could kill, they would have died countless times already.

Seeing the Gu family’s eyes, Shangguan Fei glanced at Luo Tian, who was being assisted by the crowd. He had sensed Luo Tian’s uniqueness during his battle with Tian Bo and spoke again: “Kid, I’ll give you one more chance. Become my disciple!”

“Impossible!” Luo Tian weakly replied, his wounds now stopped bleeding but his face still pale. Hearing Shangguan Fei’s words, he spoke coldly with endless ice in his voice.

“If you die, I will also die!” Gu Qianxue, seeing Shangguan Fei about to attack Luo Tian, spoke with a determined expression. At this moment, Gu Qianxue seemed to have returned to her former fierce and resolute self.

Shangguan Fei paused, gazing at Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei’s resolute expressions. He felt that if he truly killed Luo Tian, they would not hesitate to commit suicide. After thinking, he smiled: “Since Qianxue spoke, I’ll grant this favor.”

Hearing Gu Qianxue’s resolute words, Luo Tian felt his heart torn. He had not yet recovered from the sorrow of Chen Yunting’s death, and now another woman was sacrificing herself for his life. This made him feel utterly useless.

Luo Tian now longed more than ever for strength, for power. He had believed that with the Epoch Book and various techniques, he was already strong. From Tianyuan City onward, he had overcome obstacles effortlessly, smoothly. Though he hadn’t felt it, there was a sense of pride within him.

But after learning the truth about Chen Yunting’s death at Feiyun Sect and now Gu Qianxue’s tragic repetition, he realized that on the vast Tianyuan Continent, he was merely one of many prodigies. Without strength, he would be trampled upon by others.

“I don’t care how powerful the Yelang Sect is. If I discover that even a single hair of Gu Qianxue is harmed, I swear to exterminate the Yelang Sect until no bird or dog remains. Even if I die, I will retrieve your souls from the cycle of reincarnation and ensure you never enter it!” Luo Tian murmured, his eyes resolute as he gazed at Shangguan Fei like a wounded lone wolf.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words and seeing his cold gaze, Shangguan Fei—despite being at the early stage of Soul-Elemental—felt his body tremble involuntarily. His killing intent rekindled in his eyes, but after a pause, he finally suppressed it.

Feeling Shangguan Fei’s killing intent, Luo Tian still showed no fear. He turned his gaze back to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, speaking gently: “Wait for me. One day, I will storm the Yelang Sect and reunite you as a family. This is my promise to you!”

Gu Qianxue’s tears flowed uncontrollably, and she nodded, whispering: “I’ll wait for you!”

Chapter 121: Parting ()

Chapter 121: Parting

Hearing Gu Qianxue’s words, Luo Tian felt deep sorrow. He turned his gaze again to Gu Lei: “Take care of your sister!”

Luo Tian knew that although Gu Qianxue had remarkable talent, she was far behind Gu Lei in terms of interpersonal skills. He recalled how Gu Yun had fought to keep his children from joining the Yelang Sect, and he knew that the Yelang Sect was certainly no good place.

“Don’t worry! Brother, remember to tell that old man your master—his name will always be my master!” Gu Lei approached Luo Tian and gave him a gentle hug.
