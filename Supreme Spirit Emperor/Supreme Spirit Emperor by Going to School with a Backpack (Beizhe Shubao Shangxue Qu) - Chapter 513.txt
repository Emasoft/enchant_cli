“Damn you two little bastards! How dare you slander me behind my back!” The old man, resembling a thin monkey, muttered angrily, his voice loud but the people around him seemed deaf and blind to his presence.

“Are you trying to kill my Sawang Palace’s young master? He is the disciple of our sect leader!” Shao Honglang’s face bore an air of authority as he gazed at Zhao Tianping and Jiao Lei.

“Forgive us, Deputy Sect Leader! I didn’t know these geniuses were from the Sawang Palace!” Zhao Tianping’s face broke out in cold sweat, losing his former authority as he bowed so low his face nearly touched the ground.

Zhao Tianping longed to slap himself; he had never imagined these people were truly from the Sawang Palace. One was the heir of the sect leader, and the other was his disciple—exactly as Meng Xue had said, they were indeed the prodigies of Shahuai City.

What was Zhao Chenglong? Even if these ancestors killed Zhao Chengfeng, Zhao Tianping wouldn’t dare say a word.

“Since this is your first offense and you were unaware of the young master’s identity, I’ll forgive you once. If this happens again, I will personally exterminate you!” Shao Honglang sneered before turning his gaze to the crowd.

“Listen up! No matter which sect you belong to, this is our Sawang Palace’s young master, Meng Xue!”

“This is the disciple of our sect leader! If anything happens to them, don’t blame us for being ruthless. Even if they face danger outside, we will never rest until they are avenged!” Shao Honglang pointed at Meng Xue and Ran Hao.

“Yes!” The crowd responded loudly, their eyes first on Meng Xue then shifting to Ran Hao, a look of envy in their gazes.

“Ran Hao has truly become the disciple of the Sawang Palace’s sect leader!”

“Suddenly, a sparrow has flown to a phoenix’s perch! This will surely make the Jiao family regret their decisions!” The people wore expressions of schadenfreude, gazing at Jiao Lei whose face was ashen.

“How could he become the disciple of the Sawang Palace’s sect leader?” Jiao Lei stood motionless, as if struck by lightning. His mind echoed with Shao Honglang’s words—Ran Hao was the disciple of the Sawang Palace leader.

The Sawang Palace leader, Meng Wushuang, possessed Immortal King cultivation. Even across the Central Three Heavens, those with Immortal King status were rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The reason Shahuai City endured was because of Meng Wushuang’s backing.

If Zhao Tianping had known Ran Hao was Meng Wushuang’s disciple, there would have been no Zhao family issue. Even if he had to beg Jiao Lei for mercy, it would have been worth it.

“Jiao family head, now my brother—does he match your daughter Jiao Lu?” As Jiao Lei was lost in thought, Luo Tian’s mocking voice echoed in his ears, snapping him back to reality.

“Matches! Matches!” Jiao Lei quickly replied, glancing at Shao Honglang and the Sawang Palace crowd’s fierce expressions. If he said otherwise, they would tear him apart. He quickly affirmed.

“Then good. Let’s settle the marriage arrangement now! This is our dowry!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a series of vials brimming with vibrant vitality appeared before Jiao Lei.

Luo Tian turned, approaching Sun Kelnian’s side. Seizing the moment Sun Kelnian was distracted, he instantly immobilized him and stripped off his bracelet, hairpin, and ornaments, placing them before Jiao Lei.

“Luo Tian! I’ll fight you for this!” Sun Kelnian regained freedom, his face flushed with anger as he lunged at Luo Tian—but Chen Zhanbiao grabbed him back.

“Haha, little fat boy, you should boost your strength before fighting. You’re still at the late True Immortal stage!” Chen Zhanbiao grunted, his tone laced with disdain.

“Frustrating! Frustrating!” Sun Kelnian cursed, but he couldn’t escape, only venting his anger.

“Jiao Lu!” Ran Hao gazed at Jiao Lu, recalling her plea to Jiao Lei. He now understood she had made that choice for him.

“I’m sorry, I had no choice. The will of parents outweighs heaven; if I didn’t marry Zhao Chenglong, my Zhao family would surely decline!” Jiao Lu’s eyes held regret.

“It’s fine, it’s all over now!” Ran Hao sighed deeply, gazing at Luo Tian with gratitude. Without Luo Tian’s words back then, he wouldn’t have passed Meng Wushuang’s trial in the Desert of Death.

Chapter 1973: Pursuit by Guiyuan Sect

Outside Shahuai City, Luo Tian and the others smiled as they resolved Ran Hao’s issue. Luo Tian decided to leave Shahuai City, with the Battle for Heaven approaching. He also needed to visit Huantian City to find the master artisan Lu Chong and install the string on the Shooting Sun Bow.

“Idiots! Do you think you can find us? That’s pure fantasy!” Sun Kelnian sneered, muttering.

Sun Kelnian didn’t separate from Luo Tian again but planned to part ways after entering Huantian City.

Luo Tian understood Sun Kelnian feared something happening to him; the Central Three Heavens were chaotic, and many sought Luo Tian’s group.

“Let’s go!” Meng Xue exclaimed, her eyes alight with excitement. Since entering the Immortal Realm, she had rarely left Meng Wushuang’s side. Now that she was out, she was thrilled.

“Goodbye!” Luo Tian bowed to Ran Hao and Jiao Lu before leaping into the air toward Huantian City.

“Luo Xiong, I’ll never forget your kindness. I won’t disappoint you or my master!” Ran Hao watched Luo Tian’s group depart, whispering softly before turning with Jiao Lu into Shahuai City.

Ran Hao had barely left when three figures from the Guiyuan Sect appeared at the city gate, their faces alight with joy.

“Unexpectedly, he left Shahuai City! This is my chance!” Two middle-aged men with early True Immortal cultivation glowed with excitement.

These three had been monitoring Luo Tian within Shahuai City for days. The old man at late True Immortal stage had waited for an opportunity to personally subdue Luo Tian.

But these days, Luo Tian hadn’t left the Sawang Palace, so the old man had no chance. When they thought Luo Tian would stay in the Sawang Palace, he and his group had exited instead.

“That girl, the daughter of the Peerless Immortal, is with him. That might cause trouble. Still, if I’m careful, it should be fine.” The old man murmured before rising into the sky.

“Ha…” But as they just took flight to chase Luo Tian’s group, a long yawn echoed in their ears. An invisible pressure descended upon them, slamming the three into the ground like flies caught in a flyswatter.

“Immortal King’s pressure!” The three gasped, their eyes wide with fear as they gazed at a figure walking through the wind.

“Respect the Immortal King!” They bowed, their expressions filled with reverence.

At the same time, the old man approached them, his thin frame making one think he was just an old drunkard. Yet this frail man possessed the power to move mountains and fill seas.

“Respected elder, we wish to leave Shahuai City.” The old man at late True Immortal stage spoke, his demeanor as docile as a child before an Immortal King.

“I have a task for you. If successful, there will be rewards!” The old man smiled, his small eyes gleaming with cunning. If Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu were here, they’d know someone or a faction was about to suffer.

This old man’s eyes mirrored the cunning of Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo, even more so.

“What task do you have for us?” Hearing the old man’s words, the Guiyuan Sect three dared not delay. Though they longed for this powerful figure to leave, they couldn’t afford to offend him.

After all, he was an Immortal King. If they pleased this old man, the Guiyuan Sect would be annihilated by him alone.

“Hmm, go and dismantle the gates of the Sawang Palace!” The old man smiled, but the three’s faces darkened.

“W-what?” The Guiyuan Sect three, as if they hadn’t heard correctly, shook their heads vigorously.

The Sawang Palace was a place even the Guiyuan Sect at its peak dared not touch. Now, with no courage to provoke it, they couldn’t even dare to touch its gates.

“Don’t worry; there’s no need to fear. I’ll protect you. If Meng Wushuang dares to come out, I’ll deal with him!” The old man spoke dismissively.

“Truly?” The three Guiyuan Sect elders looked doubtful, gazing at the old man.

“Are you questioning me?” The old man’s face darkened, his gaze fixed on them.

“No… we dare not!”

“Then we’ll go!” The three quickly replied, fearing the old man would slap them to death.

“Good. Be bold and fearless. After dismantling the gates, shout three times that Meng Wushuang is a bastard! I’ll watch from the shadows!” The old man nodded in satisfaction.

“Yes!” The three’s cold sweat dripped as they entered Shahuai City, their faces bitter. The old man vanished without a trace.

The three reached the Sawang Palace gates, exchanging glances before encouraging each other. Three hands凝聚, striking the gate with all their might.

“Who are you?” Two guards at the gates were stunned to find anyone daring to attack the Sawang Palace.

“Boom… boom…” The thunderous sound echoed as the green gate was shattered by their combined strength.

“Meng Wushuang is a bastard… Meng Wushuang is a bastard… Meng Wushuang is a bastard!” Three shouts, each louder than the last, echoed through heaven and earth. The crowd gasped in shock.

“Who dares to insult the Peerless Immortal of Shahuai City?”

“My heavens! They even shattered the Sawang Palace gates! What grudge could this be?” The people murmured, gazing at the Guiyuan Sect three with awe.

The three stood motionless, their initial tension replaced by a sense of pride as the crowd’s admiration filled them.

“Who dares to cause trouble in my Sawang Palace!” As the people murmured, three figures burst into the sky, their eyes blood-red. They didn’t hesitate, their hands slamming down with True Immortal power to crush the Guiyuan Sect three.

The three hands belonged to Shao Honglang, Xu Yongshan, and Chen Zhenhai’s combined effort. The heavens roared as the Guiyuan Sect three were crushed, leaving no remnants. Only the late True Immortal spat blood.

“Such weak strength! How dare you cause trouble in my Sawang Palace!” Shao Honglang grabbed the late True Immortal, dragging him into the palace.

“Hm? How many enemies did these boys offend?” The old man, lounging lazily, watched the late True Immortal being dragged into the palace. He turned, took a step, and his form twisted before vanishing.

…

Seven days later, Luo Tian’s group entered Huantian City, their faces filled with confusion. They had expected many troubles on the way but found none.

“Damn strange! It was so peaceful!” Sun Kelnian muttered, feeling like he had thrown a punch into the air.

“You’re too troublesome! It’s better to have it smooth!” Sima Tuo rolled his eyes. The two left the city immediately after entering, separating from Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was also puzzled but sighed in relief, walking with Meng Xue and Chen Zhanbiao toward the city lord’s mansion.

Not long after, they arrived at the city lord’s mansion. Luo Tian presented the Heaven-Refining Seal and said, “Please inform the island master of Huantian City that I, Luo Tian from the Lower Heavens, wish to see him!”

“The Heaven-Refining Seal!” Two guards’ faces shifted slightly before they rushed inside. They knew the seal’s power and dared not delay.

Not long after, Jiang Huantian emerged from the courtyard but his face was dark. He approached Luo Tian.

“Why have you come here?” Jiang Huantian spoke sternly, his tone laced with reproach.

“Respected elder, is there something wrong?” Luo Tian quickly noticed Jiang Huantian’s odd expression.

“Don’t come to Huantian City again. If you want to find me at Huantian Island, this city isn’t under my control!” Jiang Huantian spoke sternly before leading Luo Tian into the mansion.

“Forgive my recklessness!” Luo Tian’s mind jolted; he sensed he might have caused trouble.

“Why did you come?” Jiang Huantian asked, gazing at Luo Tian. He felt Luo Tian wouldn’t have come without reason.

“I found the string for the Shooting Sun Bow and hope you can help me find Master Lu Chong to install it!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice only for Jiang Huantian.

“Did you find something suitable for the Shooting Sun Bow’s string?” Jiang Huantian frowned but his expression shifted, gazing at Luo Tian.

Jiang Huantian was no fool; after a brief thought, he deduced Luo Tian’s actions.

“You’re bold! Go on, someone wants to see you. Remember not to be too bold and don’t mention the Shooting Sun Bow!” Jiang Huantian warned Luo Tian, making his face stiffen.

Chapter 1974: Jiang Yuwen

Luo Tian didn’t let Meng Xue and Chen Zhanbiao accompany him. Seeing Jiang Huantian’s solemn expression, he knew he might have caused trouble. Meng Xue and Chen Zhanbiao were fiery-tempered; they might stir up chaos.

“Who is it that wants to see me?” Luo Tian followed Jiang Huantian, asking.

“The elder brother of the young master, Jiang Yuwen!” Jiang Huantian spoke solemnly before adding, “Jiang Yezhe is kind, but Jiang Yuwen is the opposite. Remember not to provoke him when you meet Jiang Yuwen. As for the Heaven-Refining Seal, I’ll try to get it back from Jiang Yuwen.”

“Heaven-Refining Seal?” Luo Tian frowned, not expecting the trouble to stem from it. He knew the Heaven-Refining Seal wasn’t simple; Jiang Taibai had used it to seal the Nine Gates of Hell.

As they spoke, they reached a grand hall. Jiang Huantian pushed open the door, and music filled Luo Tian’s ears.

Scented winds drifted as several girls in thin silk danced, their bodies swaying. On the throne sat a young man with a smile, watching them dance. Two beauties behind him massaged his shoulders.

The young man resembled Jiang Yezhe but radiated a sharp aura, as if it could wound anyone.

On either side stood two middle-aged men with stern faces—men accustomed to deciding others’ fates. Their auras matched Jiang Huantian’s, both at late True Immortal stage.

“Jiang Yuwen, Luo Tian has arrived!” Jiang Huantian bowed slightly before the young man.

“Oh?” Jiang Yuwen waved his hand, and the music and dancers stopped instantly.

He fixed his gaze on Luo Tian, locking eyes with him. At that moment, Luo Tian felt a tremor within himself.

“Genius! A genius of unparalleled talent!” That was Luo Tian’s first thought—this young man seemed carefree, yet Luo Tian felt this instinctively.

“Are you the one who saved my incompetent brother?” Jiang Yuwen picked up the Heaven-Refining Seal on the table and asked.

“Yes!” Luo Tian nodded, bowing to Jiang Yuwen. The two middle-aged men beside him frowned.

“Jiang Yezhe is my brother. You saved him; how should I thank you?” Jiang Yuwen’s calm face asked.

“I am a friend of Jiang Xiong; saving him was natural!” Luo Tian replied, his gaze fixed on Jiang Yuwen.

“Interesting… interesting. Do you know what this Heaven-Refining Seal represents?” Jiang Yuwen smiled, his eyes flashing with killing intent as he spoke.

At the same time, the two late True Immortal men beside Jiang Yuwen unleashed their auras, pressing down on Luo Tian.

“I don’t know!” Luo Tian remained calm, his robes fluttering but his posture upright.

“Don’t know?”

“Then kill him!” Jiang Yuwen spoke lazily, as if crushing an ant. He then pocketed the Heaven-Refining Seal.

“Yes!” Hearing Jiang Yuwen’s words, the two middle-aged men stepped forward toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian and Jiang Huantian’s faces changed instantly; they hadn’t expected Jiang Yuwen to be so capricious, killing Luo Tian without hesitation.

“Jiang Yuwen, don’t!” Jiang Huantian shouted, stepping in front of Luo Tian, gazing at Jiang Yuwen.

“Kill me?” Luo Tian felt coldness, stepping back a few steps. Though they were late True Immortal stage, Luo Tian wouldn’t let himself be killed without resistance.

“Jiang Huantian! Step aside; are you defying the young master’s orders?” One middle-aged man shouted.

“Boom…” The other middle-aged man was more direct, extending a golden finger that unleashed True Immortal power to crush Luo Tian.

“Jiang Huantian! If you kill this Luo Tian, Jiang Yezhe will surely retaliate against us!” Jiang Huantian shouted, watching the golden finger press down. He punched out.

“Boom…” The sound echoed as Jiang Huantian took a step back, and the middle-aged man also retreated two steps.

“You fear Jiang Yezhe’s retaliation but not my anger?” Jiang Yuwen glared at Jiang Huantian.

“Jiang Huantian, you once had the chance to serve me but wasted it! You chose that sickly boy!”

“Jiang Huantian, you’ve rebelled. Kill him!” Jiang Yuwen spoke coldly.

“His target isn’t me… it’s Jiang Huantian!” Luo Tian realized instantly; Jiang Yuwen was merely using him as an excuse to kill Jiang Huantian!

“This feeling is really bad!” Luo Tian muttered, never expecting Jiang Yuwen to be so ruthless. A late True Immortal, he killed without hesitation.

“Respectful servant dare not! I am loyal to the Heaven-Refining Sect!” Jiang Huantian’s face shifted slightly at Jiang Yuwen’s words.

“Loyal to the Heaven-Refining Sect? Then why did you block me from killing this Luo Tian?”

“If you are loyal to the Heaven-Refining Sect, then I’ll give you a chance. Kill this Luo Tian yourself and prove your loyalty!” Jiang Yuwen sneered, addressing Jiang Huantian.

“This…” Jiang Huantian was momentarily stunned. Luo Tian’s face also shifted; if Jiang Huantian attacked him again, he might die here, and it would be a pitiful end as Jiang Yezhe’s tool.

Jiang Huantian’s cold sweat dripped down; he hadn’t expected Jiang Yuwen to target him. This was a double-edged plan.

If Jiang Huantian killed Luo Tian, Jiang Yezhe would surely have a grudge. Also, Jiang Huantian knew what the Heaven-Refining Seal meant for Jiang Yezhe.

The Heaven-Refining Immortal had nine sons, each with three Heaven-Refining Seals. These seals were allocated among the nine sons as their personal forces—absolute loyalists.

If he didn’t kill, Jiang Yuwen would eliminate Jiang Huantian and remove Jiang Yezhe’s ally.

“Jiang Yuwen, do you respect Uncle Jiang Taibai?” As Jiang Huantian was at a loss, Luo Tian’s voice echoed. He waved his hand, and a gourd appeared in his palm.

“Uncle?” Seeing the gourd in Luo Tian’s hand, Jiang Yuwen’s face shifted slightly, his eyes filled with confusion.

Seeing the wine gourd in Luo Tian’s hand, Jiang Huantian’s eyes brightened: “Jiang Yuwen, the Great Sword Immortal did meet Luo Tian. He favored him and gave him a gourd of wine, saying if he had trouble, he could seek help!”

Jiang Huantian spoke loudly, recounting how Luo Tian met Jiang Taibai. He exaggerated slightly, making it seem as if Luo Tian was Jiang Taibai’s own son. Anyone who harmed Luo Tian would face Jiang Taibai’s wrath.

At this point, Jiang Huantian had no choice but to lie; after all, Jiang Taibai’s whereabouts were elusive. Jiang Yuwen couldn’t verify it.

Moreover, Jiang Taibai had indeed given Luo Tian a gourd of wine. In Jiang Huantian’s view, this was a major event; no one had ever received such treatment from Jiang Taibai, not even Jiang Yuwen and the other Heaven-Refining Sect heirs.

Jiang Yuwen’s face darkened; he could ignore Jiang Yezhe but couldn’t overlook Jiang Taibai. Everyone in the Heaven-Refining Sect feared Jiang Taibai, including himself.

“Since he is favored by Uncle Jiang Taibai, then let it be!” Jiang Yuwen waved his hand, signaling Luo Tian and Jiang Huantian to leave.

“Thank you, Jiang Yuwen!” Jiang Huantian spoke loudly before leading Luo Tian, whose face was calm, out of the hall.

“Hmph…” As they exited the hall, Jiang Huantian sighed deeply, his heart still racing.

“Thank you, respected elder!” As they exited the hall, Luo Tian’s face turned cold. Anyone who experienced that would feel annoyed. Moreover, Jiang Yuwen hadn’t returned the Heaven-Refining Seal to Luo Tian.

“I’ve burdened you!”

“For the Heaven-Refining Seal, I’ll have Jiang Yezhe help find a solution!” Jiang Huantian sighed deeply. They left the city lord’s mansion.

“My things aren’t so easily taken!” Luo Tian’s face turned icy; he knew clashing with Jiang Yuwen now would end badly. Even if he could kill Jiang Yuwen, he’d die alongside him.

“Those two were Jiang Yuwen’s bodyguards—Jiang Chen and Jiang Wu Xin.”

“I command the Huantian Island, while Jiang Wu Xin commands the Huantian City. We’ve never gotten along. Jiang Wu Xin is Jiang Yuwen’s man, while I support Jiang Yezhe.”

“Eventually, Jiang Yezhe may seek your help. Be prepared! I hope you don’t refuse!” Jiang Huantian spoke to Luo Tian.

“Hmph.” Luo Tian nodded, beginning to understand why Jiang Yezhe had given him the Heaven-Refining Seal. But at this moment, Luo Tian was still too weak.

“Let’s go! Master Lu Chong is in this Huantian City. I’ll take you there. Once the string is installed, we’ll leave quickly! Back to Huantian Island, it’s my territory!” Jiang Huantian spoke again before leading Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue through the streets of Huantian City.

Not long after, Jiang Huantian led Luo Tian through winding alleys to a secluded courtyard. The alley looked quiet, with no passersby.

At the entrance of a dilapidated courtyard, Jiang Huantian stopped. A clanging sound echoed from within the courtyard, along with a scorching aura.

“Is this where the master artisan lives?” Meng Xue looked puzzled; she had heard of Lu Chong, known as the top artisan in the Immortal Realm. She hadn’t expected him to live so modestly.

Chapter 1975: Lu Chong

“Lu’s Iron Workshop!”

Luo Tian gazed at the crooked characters on the door plaque. If not for careful inspection, one wouldn’t notice they were even there.

“Let’s go! Be respectful; Master Lu is eccentric, so don’t do anything out of line!” Jiang Huantian spoke to Luo Tian and the others, his expression filled with reverence. He gently knocked on the courtyard door.

“Creak…” Not long after, a burly middle-aged man in a short-sleeved shirt opened the door.

“Ah, it’s you, Island Master Jiang!” The man recognized Jiang Huantian and greeted him warmly before leading him into the small courtyard.

As they entered, it was a different scene: several middle-aged men stood in line, their faces respectful as they watched an old man.

“Clang… clang…” The old man held a green hammer, striking a red longsword repeatedly with a focused expression.

A young man crouched nearby, pulling a bellows, his face drenched in sweat. Flames of red and white flickered constantly.

“Add more fire!” The old man commanded, placing the sword model into the furnace for quenching. Not long after, he took it out again and struck it.

The old man had white hair but a frail body, mismatched with his heavy hammer. Yet each strike was profound and weighty.

Luo Tian also felt a special vibration with every hammer strike, like the roar of the Dao. It didn’t cause noise but made one breathe and even heartbeats synchronize with the hammer’s rhythm.

“Island Master Jiang has arrived!” The middle-aged men, seeing Jiang Huantian, smiled and greeted him.

“Everyone, what’s going on?” Jiang Huantian looked puzzled at the old man.

“They are from various sects in the Central Three Heavens, requesting Master Lu to forge a weapon!” The men replied.

Lu Chong was the top artisan in the Immortal Realm, known to all. Yet his whereabouts were elusive. Now that they had found him, they naturally sought his help to forge a divine weapon. Lu Chong’s craftsmanship was unmatched.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light, listening to the hammer strikes. His gaze was fixed on Lu Chong’s hammer, his breathing syncing with each strike—quick when the hammer fell fast, slow when it was steady.

“Hey, what’s wrong with you?” Jiang Huantian noticed Luo Tian wasn’t responding and spoke again. But no matter how he called, Luo Tian seemed deaf.

“Clang… clang…” The hammer strikes continued. Lu Chong ignored the crowd, striking repeatedly without placing the sword model into the fire.

Luo Tian seemed to enter another realm, his body transformed into a massive hammer, endlessly striking the heavens.

Time passed slowly. Jiang Huantian noticed Luo Tian wasn’t responding and stopped, speaking with the sect elders.

One hour… two hours…

As time passed, Lu Chong never stopped striking, his face drenched in sweat.

“Island Master Jiang, you’ve come at a good time! I heard this sword has been forged for forty-nine days and is meant to be an upper-tier divine weapon, commissioned by a sect elder from the Heaven-Sword Sect.

The man who led Luo Tian and Jiang Huantian into the courtyard, along with the young man pulling the bellows, wore puzzled expressions. According to logic, Lu Chong should have quenched it three times in an hour, but he hadn’t even done so.

“Boom…” Finally, a thunderous sound echoed as Lu Chong’s sword model exploded into sparks. Flames scattered everywhere.

This thunderous sound shook the heavens and earth, sending invisible waves outward. The Dao roared, and the sky paused momentarily. Everyone’s hearts stopped for a beat. Invisible waves swept outward, causing Jiang Huantian and the others to retreat.

At the same time, Luo Tian and the others opened their eyes in surprise.

Lu Chong grabbed the sparks and threw them into a pile of scrap iron.

“Hiss…” The red-hot sparks fell into green water, emitting hissing sounds and rising white smoke around Lu Chong.

“This sword is ruined. Have Chisongzi bring new materials!” Lu Chong spoke calmly to the middle-aged man before gazing at Luo Tian and the others.

Lu Chong strode toward them, his eyes glowing with intensity, causing Jiang Huantian and the others to frown.

“First meeting with Master Lu’s hammer technique, yet you’ve already penetrated it. You’re a promising talent! Your body is also remarkably strong!” Lu Chong spoke, causing Jiang Huantian’s face to shift slightly.

“Did they enter a trance and comprehend Master Lu’s hammer technique?” The sect elders’ faces changed, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“How could that be!” The middle-aged man and young man spoke in shock, but recalling Luo Tian’s state, they understood. After all, they had followed Lu Chong for years and knew his hammer technique.

As they spoke, Lu Chong approached Luo Tian and the others, scanning their bodies with his gaze.

“This kid always causes trouble wherever he goes!” Jiang Huantian smiled, recalling every encounter with Luo Tian and secretly marveled at Jiang Yezhe’s sharp eyes.

“Hmph…” But as Jiang Huantian’s words ended, his expression slightly paused.

He had thought Lu Chong admired Luo Tian, but instead, Lu Chong bypassed Luo Tian and approached Chen Zhanbiao, patting his sturdy muscles.

“Tell me what you felt?” Lu Chong asked Chen Zhanbiao, his eyes filled with anticipation.

“I just felt myself turn into a giant, wielding a massive hammer to strike the heavens and earth, wanting to forge this world!” Chen Zhanbiao scratched his head, recounting his feelings.

“Boom… boom…” The sound of thunder echoed as Chen Zhanbiao’s words ended. A wave of energy rose from the sky, as if his words had touched a forbidden boundary.

“Magnificent and grand!” Jiang Huantian and the others looked shocked at Chen Zhanbiao’s words.

“Such insight!” The middle-aged man and young man were equally astonished, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao with disbelief.

They had followed Lu Chong for years, understanding his hammer technique and even managing to perform a few moves. But it had taken them a long time, and their insights were nothing compared to Chen Zhanbiao’s.

“Good! Good! Good!” Hearing Chen Zhanbiao’s answer, Lu Chong’s eyes gleamed with even more joy. He looked at Chen Zhanbiao as if viewing a piece of unpolished jade.

“What about you two?” Lu Chong turned to Luo Tian and Meng Xue, smiling at them.

“I felt I entered a pivotal moment, transforming into a giant!” Meng Xue spoke, prompting Lu Chong to smile.

“I felt I turned into a massive hammer, smashing a hole in the heavens!” Luo Tian answered truthfully. But as his words ended, another thunderous sound echoed from the sky, and a lightning bolt streaked across, descending toward Luo Tian.

“Go…!” Lu Chong sneered, sending an invisible wave to envelop the courtyard. The golden lightning hadn’t reached Luo Tian’s head before it shattered.

“The Dao has become angry!” Jiang Huantian and the others’ faces shifted slightly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Again… the Dao?” Luo Tian frowned, surprised that even in the Immortal Realm, there was a Dao.

“Good! Who wishes to be my disciple?” Lu Chong spoke loudly, gazing at Luo Tian and the others.

“Master Lu is going to take three disciples!” The crowd’s faces shifted, their eyes filled with envy as they gazed at Luo Tian and the others.
