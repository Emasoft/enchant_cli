“Don’t provoke him. This new commander might be even more ruthless than Fu Tian!” Fu Zhiming instantly assessed Luo Tian in his mind.

“Yes!” Fu Zhiming bowed respectfully, his face drenched in cold sweat. He knew Luo Tian had sensed his resentment and hidden thoughts.

“I’m busy. The Star Moon Guard will be under your management for now, but don’t make me unhappy!” Luo Tian spoke softly. His voice reached Fu Zhiming’s ears, and then his figure vanished from the military training ground.

“Subordinates obey!” Fu Zhiming bowed again, waiting until Luo Tian’s figure disappeared before slowly lifting his head.

……

The Alchemy Hall stood at the northernmost part of Star Moon Sacred City. After walking for nearly an hour, Luo Tian finally arrived at the desolate entrance of the Alchemy Hall.

Outside the Alchemy Hall, a few elderly members of the Star Moon Sacred Clan moved in and out. Their faces bore an air of superiority, clearly indicating their high status within Star Moon Sacred City.

As Luo Tian stepped into the Alchemy Hall, he immediately drew attention. It was rare to see such a young man in this place.

“Hello, I’d like a cauldron and some spiritual herbs!” Luo Tian displayed a respectful expression as he addressed the elderly man sitting there, who looked uninterested.

“Which kind? I’ll give you a twenty percent discount. These days, young alchemists like you are becoming rare!” The elderly man smiled slightly and spoke to Luo Tian.

“A cauldron that can withstand the冲击 of a Saint-grade elixir will do!” Luo Tian said indifferently. Though he carried the Seven Star Soul-Subduing Cauldron, he dared not use it—this was his greatest frustration.

“Saint-grade?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the elderly man’s body trembled. His eyes widened with disbelief as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Is it a Saint-grade初级 or middle grade?” The elderly man’s gaze locked onto Luo Tian, his eyes flashing with intense light. This made Luo Tian feel uneasy.

“This old man isn’t simple!” Luo Tian felt a jolt in his heart, then wore an expression of helplessness.

“Old man, you’ve misunderstood. I want a Saint-grade cauldron to try and see if I can successfully craft a Saint-grade初级 elixir!” Luo Tian said bitterly.

“Considering your age, being able to attempt a Saint-grade初级 elixir is already commendable!” The elderly man smiled, then waved his hand. A cauldron appeared before Luo Tian.

“The Alchemy Hall’s rules state that alchemy must be conducted within the hall. As for herbs, the Alchemy Hall will provide them, but we’ll take forty percent of the elixirs as fees,” he continued.

“Of course, if you ruin the herbs, you’ll have to compensate at eighty percent!” The elderly man smiled again as he spoke.

“Really stingy!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly, but there was nothing he could do. He had a little Qi stone now, but he needed to conserve it.

“Go on. The back mountain should have an empty spot. Flames will spew from the mountain; by the time you finish alchemy, you’ll know it’s worth it!” It seemed the elderly man had sensed Luo Tian’s thoughts. He smiled and said.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian felt some doubt but maintained a respectful expression. He inscribed the herbs he needed, stored the cauldron, and headed toward the back mountain of the Alchemy Hall.

Along the way, Luo Tian saw several people like himself. Some were heading toward the back mountain, while others looked disappointed as they came out of it.

The more Luo Tian walked, the more he felt a scorching heat pressing against his body. A霸道 aura also penetrated his mind.

“This Alchemy Hall’s flames aren’t ordinary!” Luo Tian felt puzzled, sensing a strange familiarity in the fire.

After about fifteen minutes, he reached the so-called back mountain of the Alchemy Hall. His expression changed immediately.

Before him stood a massive mountain with numerous cracks. From these fissures, Luo Tian felt an intense heat and even saw faint streaks of lightning-like flames emerging.

On the mountain, some people stood with solemn expressions. Before them were cauldrons—clearly alchemists in the process of refining elixirs. Their surroundings were surrounded by transparent barriers, allowing clear visibility. Luo Tian guessed this was intentional by the Alchemy Hall; since alchemists were so rare, watching others refine elixirs could help improve their skills.

“Boom…!” Thunderous sounds echoed in the sky, and black storm clouds rolled in. Luo Tian’s gaze fell on a woman at the mountain peak.

“Saint-grade初级 elixir! It's Princess Xuan!” Someone recognized the woman and exclaimed, eyes filled with fervor.

Chapter 1294: The Sacred City Princess ( )

At the back mountain of the Alchemy Hall, black storm clouds loomed over the summit. Golden lightning bolts surged downward like serpents, striking against the transparent barriers.

However, these terrifying thunderstorms vanished upon touching the seemingly transparent barriers. They seemed to be instantly absorbed by the barriers, transforming into lightning runes that drifted along the barriers before being drawn into the mountain’s fiery eruptions.

“Amazing!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He hadn’t expected this mountain could absorb the elixir thunderstorms.

Alchemy was most feared by the inability of elixirs to withstand lightning. Many alchemists failed because their elixirs couldn’t endure the thunderstorms, leading to destruction. Yet here, alchemy could be conducted without such worries.

Princess Xuan of the Sacred City! Fu Xingxuan, daughter of the Star Moon Sacred Emperor. The most beloved daughter of the Star Moon Sacred Emperor. Despite her three brothers’ fierce rivalry, they all doted on this younger sister.

Fu Xingxuan was younger than Fu Xingchen, the third son of the Star Moon Sacred Emperor, by several years. Yet her talent was no less than that of the three princes. Her cultivation had reached half a纪元, and her talent in alchemy was astonishingly exceptional—she was the youngest Saint-grade alchemist in Star Moon Sacred City. Such an achievement had never been reached by any elder strength within the Star Moon Sacred Clan.

Moreover, Fu Xingxuan was known as the number one beauty of the Star Moon Sacred Clan. While all members of the Star Moon Sacred Clan were more handsome than ordinary humans, Fu Xingxuan’s title as the number one beauty suggested her appearance was truly extraordinary.

Dressed in a purple robe, she concealed her figure. Yet Luo Tian could sense the fiery allure beneath it. Her long purple hair was neatly draped over her shoulders, and her violet eyes seemed to speak.

“Not bad!” Fu Xingxuan’s pale face showed satisfaction. She smiled slightly and collected the elixir.

This smile was enough to make the alchemists observing her from around the mountain gaze at her with infatuation, viewing her as a celestial maiden.

Luo Tian felt a surge of admiration. After much thought, his evaluation of Fu Xingxuan was simply two words: perfect!

This was Luo Tian’s first time seeing such a flawless woman. Every aspect of Fu Xingxuan embodied the concept of perfection.

However, Luo Tian was only momentarily astonished before altering his appearance and finding a fissure. He intended to start refining elixirs himself. He knew that refining a Saint-grade middle-grade elixir would surely cause a stir, and he didn’t want to draw too much attention in Star Moon Sacred City.

Fu Xingxuan, observing the admiring glances around her, showed no expression. She had long been accustomed to such gazes since she turned eighteen. Yet, Luo Tian’s presence surprised her momentarily. Upon seeing his youth, she displayed a look of disdain. Though Luo Tian looked unfamiliar, she assumed he was an admirer—such methods to draw her attention were common for her, occurring every few days.

Fu Xingxuan’s lips curled into a slight smile. She flew down the back mountain, having refined the elixir she desired and no longer wishing to stay.

Luo Tian ignored Fu Xingxuan’s departure, his eyes filled with interest as he gazed at the flames bursting from the mountain body.

The flames were of a pale blue hue, and their terrifying heat made Luo Tian’s brows furrow slightly. He sensed the presence of lightning power within these flames.

“Celestial fire?” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He extended his hand, capturing a fragment of the flame and placing it in his palm, muttering softly.

“Thunder-Devouring Celestial Fire!” In the next moment, Luo Tian knew the name of this celestial fire. His heart brimmed with joy.

“Unexpectedly, I’ve encountered this flame here. If it truly can be used to refine elixirs, then it’s definitely worth it!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly, recalling his own碧晶琉璃火 (Emerald Crystal Glaze Fire). He wondered if he would ever see it again.

“Now I understand why the thunderstorms were absorbed by the barriers. It’s because of this flame!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with a smile, recalling the description of Thunder-Devouring Celestial Fire.

Thunder-Devouring Celestial Fire ranked higher than Emerald Crystal Glaze Fire among celestial fires. Its greatest feature was consuming lightning to evolve. Due to this extraordinary trait, it was every alchemist’s dream.

“Since that’s the case, I can now refine elixirs without hesitation!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He waved his hand, placing the cauldron he had rented from the Alchemy Hall before him.

“Hmph.” However, shortly after, Luo Tian glanced around with an odd expression.

He noticed that with Fu Xingxuan’s departure, the back mountain had become almost deserted. Only he and a couple of elderly men remained on the peak, while two others were fully focused on refining elixirs.

“Her charm is really powerful!” Luo Tian smiled, looking at the empty mountain peak and sighing softly. At this point, he had fully realized that the Alchemy Hall was even more desolate than he had imagined. The crowd earlier had all come for Fu Xingxuan.

“This barrier is truly excellent—it not only integrates thunderstorms into Thunder-Devouring Celestial Fire but also allows no one else to watch!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and the previously clear barrier began to blur.

An hour later, a Saint-grade初级 elixir appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. His eyes showed dissatisfaction.

“A single Saint-grade初级 elixir can exchange for one thousand merit points. To enter the Thunder Roar Hall, you need a hundred thousand merit points!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a bitter smile. This meant he needed to refine ten thousand Saint-grade初级 elixirs to accumulate the required hundred thousand merit points. Even if he didn’t eat or drink, he could only refine twelve per day—meaning over three years. And he would have to give forty percent of the elixirs to the Alchemy Hall. Luo Tian was too lazy to calculate further.

“Not good enough. I need to refine Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs instead. One of those would earn ten thousand merit points!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with determination.

“However, Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs require a large amount of herbs. It would be ideal to have several Saint-grade herbs, which would save me a lot of time!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with a smile.

“Additionally, the Alchemy Hall has a wall of elixirs. If one can comprehend it, they can gain considerable merit points!” Luo Tian thought while taking out a jade slip. He inscribed all the required herbs onto it, then crushed it before continuing to refine Saint-grade初级 elixirs. He waited for the arrival of herbs needed for refining middle-grade elixirs.

……

In the Alchemy Hall:

“Grandpa, I’m leaving!” Fu Xingxuan smiled playfully as she addressed the elderly man who had provided Luo Tian with the cauldron.

“Hmm, go on. Come back often; this Alchemy Hall is really quiet!” The elderly man smiled at Fu Xingxuan, clearly her presence had brought much vitality and revenue.

“Okay, I’ll come often!” Fu Xingxuan looked at the followers who had accompanied her, a smile on her face.

“Hmm…” The elderly man nodded, signaling Fu Xingxuan could leave. However, his brows furrowed slightly, and an imprint was etched into his mind.

“Who is it?” The elderly man’s eyes widened with surprise, as names of various herbs flooded his mind.

“Send it to him. I want to see if he can refine it. If he fails, he’ll have to spit out whatever he ate!” The elderly man thought for a moment before speaking to the boy waiting for his reply.

“Grandpa, what’s wrong?” Fu Xingxuan heard the elderly man’s words and showed interest, asking him.

“Nothing. A new person came in and asked for a lot of herbs. He even claimed he wanted three Saint-grade herbs!” The elderly man shook his head, smiling affectionately at Fu Xingxuan.

“Really? Who is so skilled? Using Saint-grade herbs, he must be refining a middle-grade elixir!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes sparkled with excitement, her interest deepening.

“Maybe he wanted to draw your attention. My little Xingxuan’s charm has always been so strong!” The elderly man spoke, his voice filled with affection.

“Hmph. That’s why! Earlier, someone pretended not to look at me to draw my attention. But he looked completely unfamiliar. I didn’t expect him to come up with this method!” Fu Xingxuan said, her eyes showing a hint of disdain.

After talking with the elderly man for a while, Fu Xingxuan prepared to leave. However, as she was about to step out of the door, the sky suddenly darkened.

“Boom…!” A heavy atmosphere enveloped the Alchemy Hall instantly. Thunderous sounds echoed in people’s ears.

“This aura?” The elderly man’s face changed abruptly, his eyes flashing with light. He vanished from the Alchemy Hall.

“Saint-grade middle-grade elixir’s thunderstorm!” Fu Xingxuan’s face also changed abruptly. She moved swiftly toward the back mountain of the Alchemy Hall.

“Someone refined a Saint-grade middle-grade elixir?” Others showed shock, and those who had just followed Fu Xingxuan to leave also rushed back toward the Alchemy Hall’s back mountain.

“Nine Heavens Boundless Elixir, open!” Luo Tian smiled, watching the black storm clouds with a heavy atmosphere above. He struck his cauldron beside him, which emitted a series of booming sounds.

“This… Saint-grade middle-grade elixir!” Two elderly men remaining on the mountain peak stared in shock at the storm clouds above, their eyes filled with amazement. They gazed at the hazy barrier surrounding Luo Tian.

Chapter 1295: You’ll follow me from now on ( )

Within the hazy barrier, Luo Tian wore a satisfied expression. He examined the smooth elixir in his hand and then looked at the surrounding barriers.

“This has saved me a lot of trouble!” Luo Tian muttered softly, carefully observing the Saint-grade middle-grade elixir—Nine Heavens Boundless Elixir.

“Hm?” However, he soon noticed something strange about the elixir. He spoke softly: “The power of plants is so scarce?”

Luo Tian quickly discovered the difference in this elixir with his alchemical expertise. He sighed softly: “It’s a pity I used that Saint-grade herb! From now on, it’s better not to use high-quality herbs here!”

“This elixir is Saint-grade middle-grade, but it’s far inferior to one that has endured thunderstorms!”

“Still, there's no choice. I need merit points. This elixir isn’t for myself; it’s fine!” Luo Tian shook his head slightly, and to save time, he began refining elixirs again.

“Who is the person inside this barrier?” However, as Luo Tian focused on refining elixirs, the elderly man appeared first outside the barrier. His gaze fell upon Luo Tian wrapped in the barrier.

The elderly man repeatedly recalled the young men who had come to the Alchemy Hall recently. However, he shook his head shortly because so many young men had come due to Fu Xingxuan.

“Grandpa, who is that person? Is he one of the elders?” Fu Xingxuan appeared beside the elderly man, her eyes glowing with intensity as she gazed at the barrier on the mountain peak.

Only five people in the entire Alchemy Hall could refine Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs. She knew them all, but she didn’t recognize this person.

“I don’t know who it is!” The elderly man shook his head, frowning slightly. He regarded the person refining elixirs on the mountain peak as one of the Alchemy Hall’s elders.

“Who is it? Why didn’t he show his face?” A group of people appeared behind Fu Xingxuan and the elderly man. These were Fu Xingxuan’s admirers.

“Buzz…” However, in the next moment, five figures appeared before everyone. Two of them were the elderly men who had seen Luo Tian’s Saint-grade middle-grade thunderstorm.

“You five…” The elderly man saw the five people and his face changed again. These five were the only ones in the Alchemy Hall who could refine Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs.

“Who is it inside?” Fu Xingxuan trembled, naturally recognizing the five people.

“It’s a young man. We didn’t pay much attention to him before!” One of the elderly men said with a hint of joy.

“I’ve discovered another genius who can refine Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs in my Alchemy Hall! I feel this youth isn’t old, yet his alchemical expertise rivals our old bones!” One of the elderly men said with admiration.

“Fu elder, is this your disciple?” One of the elderly men looked at the elderly man beside Fu Xingxuan, his eyes filled with envy.

“I don’t have such luck. I don’t know who he is!” The elderly man, referred to as Fu elder, smiled bitterly and replied.

Fu Tianqing, the uncle of the Star Moon Sacred Emperor, also the grandfather of Fu Xingxuan. The previous Star Moon Sacred Emperor was a pillar of stability for the Star Moon Sacred Clan. After stepping down, he didn’t join the Grand Hall of Elders but chose to enter the Alchemy Hall. Few people knew how terrifying his identity was.

“This barrier is so strong it even blocks my spiritual sense. I can’t see who’s inside!” Fu Tianqing shook his head lightly.

“Could it be him?” Fu Xingxuan thought of the young man who had previously tried to draw her attention.

“If it is him, I’ve misunderstood him!” Fu Xingxuan’s heart stirred. She looked at the mountain body.

“Anyway, he’ll have to come out eventually. We can wait for him to emerge!” One of the elderly men spoke, his gaze on the mountain body.

“Let’s wait,” Fu Tianqing also sighed deeply. With his cultivation, he could easily break through the barrier by force. However, he couldn’t do that because he knew the person inside was refining elixirs and might be affected.

The followers of Fu Xingxuan were also curious, but since Fu Xingxuan chose to wait here, it aligned with their wishes. They stood at the foot of the mountain and waited for Luo Tian to finish refining elixirs.

One day passed quietly under everyone’s waiting.

“Boom…!” The thunderous sound echoed again, and the storm clouds returned to the Alchemy Hall’s sky. Everyone turned their gaze toward the mountain peak.

“My god, another Saint-grade middle-grade!” One of the elderly men spoke, his eyes filled with excitement as he gazed at Luo Tian’s barrier.

“Who is it?” Five elderly men who could refine Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs showed intense confusion.

While they could also refine Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs, they had never done it consecutively. Only one person among them could achieve this—Fu Tianqing.

What shocked people was that on the third day, another Saint-grade middle-grade thunderstorm descended. This third thunderstorm completely stunned everyone, even Fu Tianqing’s eyes showed disbelief.

“This person's alchemical expertise has surpassed us!” One of the elderly men spoke, his eyes filled with bitterness. The thought of a young person surpassing him made him feel he had lived in vain.

“People compare and die!” The other elderly men also sighed loudly.

Fu Xingxuan’s eyes sparkled with excitement. This was the first time she had seen someone stronger than herself. It made Fu Xingxuan very curious about who this elixir refiner was.

On the fourth day… fifth day… every day at the same time, Saint-grade middle-grade thunderstorms descended. This phenomenon left Fu Tianqing speechless.

“Sixth day… tenth day…” Ten days passed. No one left, completely stunned by the person inside the barrier.

Ten consecutive days of refining ten Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs. This astonishing achievement could leave anyone stunned, even Fu Tianqing hadn’t done this before.

“This person’s alchemical expertise is the best in Star Moon Sacred City. Even across the Origin Domain, there has never been anyone with such alchemical expertise!” On the tenth day, Fu Tianqing’s eyes showed a touch of admiration.

Inside the barrier, Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with redness. He looked at his jade bottle, having refined ten days of Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs—this was a significant drain on him.

“Approximately, I’ll give four to the Alchemy Hall and use six to exchange for sixty thousand merit points. Then I’ll go to the Elixir Wall to gain insights. If successful, it will earn ten thousand merit points. If not, I’ll refine four more to make up the hundred thousand!” Luo Tian muttered softly. He waved his hand, and the barrier dissolved instantly. He stepped out of the mountain peak.

However, in the next moment, Luo Tian’s steps suddenly halted. His eyes showed surprise as he looked at the people on the ground.

“This…!” Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. He looked at the people on the ground, then checked himself to confirm he hadn’t been exposed. His heart was puzzled as he looked around and saw that everyone was indeed looking at him. He spoke to them: “Hey, are you all looking at me?”

“Out he came!” As Luo Tian stepped out, the people around him immediately erupted into chatter. Their gazes fell on Luo Tian.

“It’s really him!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes flashed with purple light, recognizing Luo Tian as the young man who had previously tried to draw her attention.

However, Fu Xingxuan now fully understood that the person wasn’t trying to draw her attention but was truly refining elixirs. She had been mistaken, and a flush appeared on her face.

“Who are you? Why are you here?” Fu Tianqing was the first to react. He grabbed Luo Tian and pulled him in front of himself, his eyes filled with authority. However, after a brief inspection, he realized Luo Tian wasn’t from another royal family but was indeed a member of the Star Moon Sacred Clan. His suspicion had largely disappeared.

“I am Xiao Ding. I don’t know what the elder needs from me?” Luo Tian looked puzzled but quickly guessed it was due to his Saint-grade middle-grade elixir refining that had drawn their attention.

“Why can you refine a Saint-grade middle-grade elixir?” Fu Tianqing’s status was clear. He directly asked the question as soon as Luo Tian appeared. Immediately, he ruled out that Luo Tian was the young man who had previously borrowed his cauldron.

“I received a heritage before, which contained alchemical knowledge. I am a Star Moon Guard member. Currently on leave, so I came to try. I didn’t expect it would actually succeed!” Luo Tian lied without blinking, secretly praising the magic of his thousand-face mask. It had even deceived Fu Tianqing, a mid-period纪元 master nearing the late stage.

After speaking, Luo Tian reached into his storage bag and took out a Star Moon Guard token. He respectfully handed it to Fu Tianqing.

“Hmm, this is truly a blessing for the Star Moon Sacred Clan. Good, you can come often to the Alchemy Hall. I’ll give you an eighty percent discount!” Fu Tianqing smiled, handing Luo Tian a token.

“Also, if you have any alchemical questions in the future, feel free to ask me. Don’t forget to pay the fees!” Fu Tianqing said and then left with several elderly men.

“Are you a Star Moon Guard?” Fu Xingxuan smiled, appearing as a breeze of fragrance before Luo Tian. Her eyes showed curiosity.

“Yes!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, naturally knowing she was the princess of the Star Moon Sacred Clan.

“Good. From now on, you’ll follow me. I’ll go tell my second brother. In the afternoon, you report to me!” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly and then left the crowd, leaving behind a group of admirers with envious expressions.

Chapter 1296: Where is Xiao Ding? ( )

“Huh?” Hearing Fu Xingxuan’s words, Luo Tian instinctively exclaimed. He felt four sharp glances piercing through him like needles. He inwardly laughed: “Once I leave here, there will be no Xiao Ding. Fortunately, I was smart and didn’t use my real name; otherwise, it would have been trouble!”

“Alas, brother, you really are a master of tactics!” The people around him looked at Luo Tian with reverence.

“Since ancient times, deep feelings can’t be held. Only tactics win hearts. I have both charm and talent. Princess Xingxuan never looked at me once. You just refined an elixir and made some noise, and now you’re following her. Heaven isn’t fair!” One of the Star Moon Sacred Clan men loudly lamented.

“You’re nothing. I’ve been following Princess Xingxuan for seven years, and she still treats me like a stranger!” Another Star Moon Sacred Clan man looked sorrowful. His eyes shifted from envy to jealousy, then to hatred.

“Huh…” Luo Tian looked at the people around him. Their gazes gradually changed, and his lips twitched. He ran into the Alchemy Hall, heartbrokenly handing four elixirs to Fu Tianqing.

“Hmm!” Fu Tianqing’s face showed a smiling expression. He watched Luo Tian awkwardly exit the Alchemy Hall.

“Everyone is变态! That old man really is stingy. That was forty thousand merit points!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly, found a secluded spot, restored his original appearance, and walked into the Star Moon Pavilion.

“Huh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He lay on the soft bed and took a nice nap. After all, he wouldn’t go to Fu Xingxuan’s place.

When Luo Tian awoke, it was already evening. He carried the elixirs to exchange for merit points.

In Star Moon Sacred City, merit points were extremely precious. In the entire city, especially within the three major armies, merit points were often more useful than Qi stones. So even though it was evening, the place was still crowded with people. Many guards from the three major armies had come to exchange merit points during their leave.

Merit Points Hall not only allowed exchanging for merit points but also accepting tasks. Completing tasks could earn more merit points, with different levels of tasks earning varying amounts.

Luo Tian had once wanted to take on tasks to complete a hundred thousand merit points, but the merit points from taking tasks were pitifully few. Plus, completing tasks took a long time. That’s why he decided to refine elixirs instead.

As soon as Luo Tian entered, he drew attention. After all, the Star Moon Guard’s commander had recently become a hot topic. He had also suppressed Kou Tiande outside Star Moon Sacred City with the second prince.

“I’m here to exchange merit points!” Luo Tian ignored the glances around him and smiled, approaching an empty counter. He addressed a woman resembling a maid.

“Exchange merit points? This commander has only been here for a short time, and he’s already exchanging merit points?” People showed disdain, looking at Luo Tian.

“Okay, please wait!” The maid opened the storage bag and immediately changed her expression. She looked at Luo Tian.

The maid then showed respect, took the Star Moon Guard token and carefully carved it onto Luo Tian’s commander token.

After carving was complete, the green token glowed. The maid smiled and returned the token to Luo Tian. She carefully took his storage bag and hurriedly ran toward the back courtyard.

“Buzz…” However, as soon as Luo Tian picked up the token, a buzzing sound rose from the walls of the Merit Points Hall. Then names densely filled the wall.

“What’s going on? The merit points list has changed, why is it suddenly showing up?” People looked puzzled and then turned to the merit wall.

This merit wall recorded the merit points of people within Star Moon Sacred City’s three major armies. Only those in the top 100 were recorded on the wall.

“Fu Mengchen! Sixteenth place, sixty thousand merit points!” In an instant, people’s faces changed abruptly. Their eyes showed disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian standing there.

“My god, the commander exchanged merit points with what? He suddenly jumped to sixteenth place!” Even Star Moon Guard members in the Merit Points Hall showed shock.

“Interesting,” Luo Tian looked at the names on the merit wall. The first place was Fu Xingyue with three million merit points, second place Fu Xingyang with two million eight hundred thousand, third place Fu Xingchen with two million seven hundred thousand. After that, it dropped sharply. Kou Tiande had about one million seven hundred thousand.

However, Luo Tian didn’t care at all. His goal was to obtain a hundred thousand merit points and qualify for the Thunder Roar Hall.

“Cheating! It’s definitely cheating. I’ve worked on tasks for over a year and only have ten thousand merit points. He’s got sixty thousand in just a few days!” People immediately became indignant, glaring at Luo Tian with fire in their eyes. But Luo Tian didn’t care. The angry people marched out of the Merit Points Hall.

“Cheating! This is unfair!” People didn’t dare to trouble Luo Tian, but they immediately started a commotion in the hall.

“Quiet! If you can produce six Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs, I’ll give you the same merit points. Merit Points Hall only cares about results, not sources!” A middle-aged man scolded the noisy people.

“Six! Six Saint-grade middle-grade elixirs!” People fell silent. Although some were不服, they didn’t believe Luo Tian could produce middle-grade elixirs and assumed it was Fu Xingyue helping him.

When Luo Tian returned to the Star Moon Pavilion, it was already night. He habitually sat on his bed and practiced for a night. He decided to stay quiet for two days.

The next few days, Luo Tian either practiced or handled Star Moon Guard matters at the military training ground.

However, within a few days, the entire Star Moon Sacred City was in an uproar because of one thing: the princess of the Star Moon Sacred Clan, Fu Xingxuan, had invited a young alchemist. But she was ultimately left waiting.

This matter wasn’t big or small, but the name Xiao Ding spread among people. Especially Fu Xingxuan’s admirers were furious. Their goddess had been left waiting, and many vowed to show Xiao Ding a lesson.

However, as time passed, this Xiao Ding seemed to vanish completely. No trace was found.

Yet, the fact that Luo Tian exchanged six Saint-grade elixirs for sixty thousand merit points and climbed to sixteenth place on the merit list spread. People immediately turned their attention toward Luo Tian.

“Commander, this Xiao Ding is under your jurisdiction. Hand him over!” In a short time, the fervent admirers demanded Luo Tian hand over Xiao Ding.

Luo Tian was quite helpless toward these people. They were the sons of influential figures in Star Moon Sacred City. Two or three weren’t a problem, but when they were many, Luo Tian felt quite troubled.

Although these people shouted loudly, they didn’t dare to cause trouble at the Star Moon Pavilion. After all, it wasn’t just Luo Tian who lived there; Fu Xingyue, the prince, also resided there.

However, the demand for Luo Tian to hand over Xiao Ding grew louder and louder. Eventually, it caught Fu Xingyue’s attention.

“Mengchen, come here!” Luo Tian heard Fu Xingyue’s voice in the commander token. He sighed deeply, having forgotten about this.

Luo Tian reluctantly entered Fu Xingyue’s palace. As soon as he stepped in, Fu Xingyue smiled and addressed Fu Xingxuan beside him: “Sister, let me introduce you. This is the commander of the Star Moon Guard who once rescued me in the Divine Beast Palace!”

“Hmm, brother, I need someone. You won’t refuse, will you?” Fu Xingxuan didn’t even look at Luo Tian and directly addressed Fu Xingyue, showing off. Even Luo Tian was stunned.

“Give it! Give it! My precious sister wants the moon in the sky, and I’ll pluck it for her!” Fu Xingyue smiled affectionately, pinched Fu Xingxuan’s nose, then spoke to Luo Tian: “Mengchen, does your subordinate have a Xiao Ding? Tell someone to bring him over. From now on, he’ll follow my sister!”

“This…?”

“Your Majesty, it’s not that I don’t want to. This Xiao Ding gave me six elixirs after he left the Alchemy Hall, then said he wanted to travel across the continent and took a long leave! Now I can’t even contact him. The Star Moon token seems to be isolated!” Luo Tian looked bitter, bowed respectfully to Fu Xingyue and shut the door on all possibilities.

“Is that so!” Fu Xingyue furrowed his brows slightly, then looked at Fu Xingxuan beside him. His face showed a difficult expression.
