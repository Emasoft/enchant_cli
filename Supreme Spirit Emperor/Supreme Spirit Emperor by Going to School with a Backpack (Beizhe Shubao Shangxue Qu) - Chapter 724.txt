“Your speed is commendable!” Luo Tian swung his Rending Heaven Spear, deflecting Ye Qiu’s assault. Simultaneously, the arm affixed to his spear was hurled away, vanishing into the boundless cosmos.

“Wu Xingwen, hurry and employ your life-saving technique!” The others shouted in alarm, realizing Wu Xingwen could not endure further.

“Limitless Starlight!” Wu Xingwen roared, finally making his choice—unleashing the life-saving artifact gifted by the Fifth Palace’s master before he departed.

An instant later, a surge of immense power erupted from Wu Xingwen’s grasp, appearing as a mere glimmer of starlight. Yet the overwhelming pressure caused Luo Tian to halt mid-motion.

The stars flickered, and across a million miles of the cosmos surrounding Luo Tian’s group, the starlight began to shimmer, coalescing into rivers of silver stardust that converged toward Wu Xingwen’s radiant starlight.

“This is the Starstone! So Wu Xingwen has brought it forth!” The onlookers gaped in horror, recognizing the Starstone’s origin.

Luo Tian’s expression darkened; he had once dwelled in the Reincarnation Hall and thus knew fragments of each hall’s secrets, including the Starstone of the Fifth Palace.

The Fifth Palace housed a divine stone named “Star,” rumored to have been discovered by the first palace master during his travels through hell in the outer realms. Its origin remained unknown, yet its power was staggering.

The Starstone absorbed celestial energy over centuries. When activated, the accumulated stellar force would erupt—its potency depending on the wielder’s strength. The stronger the cultivator, the more devastating the attack.

Wu Xingwen possessed the power of a late-stage Immortal King, already among the elite. Thus, unleashing the Starstone would surely bring about apocalyptic destruction.

A resonant hum filled the air as the cosmos trembled. A beam of starlight erupted from the Starstone, condensing into a streak of stardust that slashed toward Luo Tian.

“An Immortal King at the peak of its late stage shall perish! Even an Immortal King at its peak must tread carefully—inevitably sustaining injury!” Wu Xingwen’s face paled, his body seemingly drained of vitality as he watched the streak of stardust hurtle toward Luo Tian.

The crisis materialized. Luo Tian’s eyes locked onto the streak, and in the very moment it erupted, he reacted—his Huangquan Mirror materialized, unleashing a wave of annihilating light to clash with the streak.

*Boom…*

The cosmos roared, trembling as the collision shattered it into fragments.

In an instant, the starlight intensified. All present could clearly witness the annihilating light being ground to dust by the streak, then hurtling toward Luo Tian.

“This is the power of the Starstone!” Wu Xingwen spoke, yet his heart ached. He could only fully unleash the Starstone twice; and each subsequent activation would demand an even greater sacrifice.

Luo Tian extended his hand, drawing the Huangquan Mirror to his front. The streak of stardust collided with the mirror.

Luo Tian felt a colossal force strike him, and the mirror propelled him backward, spewing blood from his mouth into the cosmos.

He rebounded ten thousand zhang before halting, as Ye Qiu’s assault surged forward—black crows swarming, darkening Luo Tian’s vision. Dozens of crows lunged at him.

*Boom, boom, boom…*

Each crow shattered against Luo Tian’s body, countless in number. Amid the chaos, a radiant sword beam cleaved through the dark cosmos, slashing toward Luo Tian.

Diao Dezhu and Sun Kienian’s eyes narrowed sharply. Diao Dezhu had already resolved to aid Luo Tian, but before he could move, his body froze.

A tempest swept in, annihilating the crows instantly. A vast wing of demonic clouds materialized behind Luo Tian, and he seized Ye Qiu’s sword with his hand.

“How is this possible?” Ye Qiu’s eyes widened in shock, gazing at Luo Tian gripping the blade of Jueyun Sword.

To confront one of the Seven Deadly Swords with bare flesh—Ye Qiu had never witnessed such ease.

Blood stained the blade’s edge, and Jueyun Sword wounded Luo Tian—but the damage was minimal.

“Fury of the Divine Beast Treads the Heavens!” Luo Tian roared, launching a foot toward Ye Qiu.

*Boom…*

His boot struck Ye Qiu’s chest, sending him retreating ten thousand zhang.

“Kill!” Luo Tian growled, stepping through the void toward Wu Xingwen’s position to end him. Yet as he moved, he paused, his gaze contemplative—finally deciding to abandon the fight.

Chapter 2743: Zhou Zhiwen’s Energy ()

Beneath the cosmos, several figures materialized. As their arrival coincided with the cessation of combat between Yaochen and Chen Zhanbiao, they halted their attacks, turning their gazes toward the approaching figures.

These were the disciples of the Nine Heavens’ Mountains and Zhou Zhiwen, chairman of the Central Heaven Consortium.

They had sensed the battle’s fluctuations and decided to investigate. Upon nearing, they discovered it was Luo Tian’s group clashing.

Initially intending to bypass the scene, they found themselves unable to avoid due to proximity to the black hole. Thus, they chose to pass through.

Luo Tian’s group ceased hostilities, exchanging glances with the celestial faction. Three groups eyed each other—this time, Luo Tian’s group refrained from further attacks, as none wished to let another faction profit.

“Why have you stopped? We’re merely passing by!” The celestial faction shouted, ascending into the sky toward the black hole.

“Luo Tian, are you going to let them enter first and seize the World Heart?” Ye Qiu barked, growing anxious as the celestial faction rushed toward the black hole.

“Stop your nonsense! I never said they should go first!” Luo Tian cursed, secretly transmitting to Diao Dezhu and others to regroup.

“Shall we unite and eliminate these celestial faction members?” Wang Xiu proposed, his eyes gleaming with murder as he watched the celestial faction recede.

“Eliminate them?”

“No need!” Luo Tian shook his head. For their group, this was an excellent outcome.

If they eliminated the celestial faction, no one would oppose them—hell’s forces could also be eradicated.

Yet Luo Tian refused, for those within the Nine Domains were all shrewd individuals; none were foolish. They surely had other plans.

“Let’s finish them all at once!” Yaochen sneered, joining Luo Tian’s group as they followed the celestial faction toward the black hole.

Three groups harbored their own intentions, flying for half a day until reaching the black hole’s perimeter—seemingly near yet still five万里 (ten thousand li) away.

“Five万里,” Luo Tian murmured, standing beneath the cosmos, gazing at the twisted black hole. The surrounding void was barren, and five万里 seemed a threshold—once crossing it, an invisible force would pull him. None dared enter recklessly; no one knew what the black hole was, though they were Immortal Kings capable of overrunning this small world. Yet against the World Heart, caution was essential.

“Zhou Zhiwen, go in first!” As Luo Tian observed the black hole, a voice from the celestial faction echoed.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, glancing toward the celestial faction. Standing at the rear of their disciples was Zhou Zhiwen; the speaker was Bai Yao.

Unbeknownst to all, Bai Yao’s arm had regrown—though drooping, it was not fully recovered.

Zhou Zhiwen’s expression flickered, surprised Bai Yao had ordered him to lead the charge. His eyes reflected contemplation but soon shifted into a smile, concealing a trace of malice.

“Senior Bai Yao, the Central Heaven Consortium pales in comparison to the Nine Heavens’ Mountains. My strength is modest, unworthy of your disciples!” Zhou Zhiwen smiled at Bai Yao, maintaining a benevolent facade.

“You insolent wretch! Giving you this chance is generosity—otherwise, do you think you deserve to stand among us?” A senior scoffed.

This was Siku Kong of the Eternal Life Mountain, whose disciple Nie Yuntian and his father had been slain by Luo Tian. Now lacking a new disciple, Eternal Life Mountain relied on an Immortal King Late-stage envoy to self-proclaim his rank.

“Indeed!” Other mountain disciples echoed, their gazes mocking.

“Celestials are such brutes—what’s there to be proud of?” Hell’s faction muttered coldly.

“Hmph?” Hearing this, Luo Tian’s group was momentarily stunned; the hell faction’s words implied support for Zhou Zhiwen.

The Central Heaven Consortium now stood in a precarious position—its business interests extended into the middle three realms and even hell.

“Seems the Central Heaven Consortium has already made contact with hell’s forces. As merchants, any faction needs resources; the Central Heaven Consortium is the greatest treasure trove. Capturing it means endless resources!”

“Moreover, the Central Heaven Consortium excels in commerce and construction—any faction needs it. The celestials are fools, deserving their fate on the upper three realms! Their arrogance is their downfall!”

“Zhou Zhiwen, now chairman of the Central Heaven Consortium, if we cultivate good relations with him, he’ll surely favor us, boosting our chances of victory against hell and the celestials by a few percent! These fools treated Zhou Zhiwen thus,” Diao Dezhu transmitted.

“Indeed, fools!” Luo Tian mused, his gaze contemplative as he looked at Zhou Zhiwen.

“You dare to question us?” Bai Yao’s face darkened, barking at Zhou Zhiwen.

“You are nothing! You have no right to bargain with us!”
“You are a dog of the Nine Heavens’ Mountains. Without us, would you have this position? A dog must accept its master’s sacrifice!”
“Five breaths—enter! Or don’t blame us for being harsh!” Bai Yao roared, venting his frustration from two days prior onto Zhou Zhiwen.

*Crack…*

As Bai Yao’s words ended, a sharp slap echoed. Bai Yao was hurled backward, blood spewing from his mouth.

A figure stood where Bai Yao had been, gazing disdainfully at him—his body radiating ghostly aura. It was Wang Xiu.

“What are you?” A cold voice echoed, drawing all eyes to Wang Xiu. Hell’s faction also gathered beside him.

“Senior Zhou, such people are not worth your time. Hell’s gates are always open to the Central Heaven Consortium!” Ye Qiu smiled, placing a hand on Zhou Zhiwen’s shoulder.

*Hiss…*

The celestial faction inhaled sharply, their eyes wide with disbelief at Zhou Zhiwen.

“Alas,” Jiang Yuzu sighed, watching the fools—long-term rule had inflated these mountain disciples’ egos.

“Zhou Zhiwen, how dare you betray the celestial realm!” Seeing Zhou Zhiwen align with hell’s forces, the celestial faction roared.

“Apologies, merchants value profit!” Zhou Zhiwen smiled, gazing at the celestial faction.

Chapter 2744: Thunder Sea Marsh ()

“Zhou Zhiwen!” The celestial faction hissed, stunned Zhou Zhiwen had defected.

“Senior Zhou, shall I assist?” Luo Tian stepped forward, smiling at the celestial faction.

As Luo Tian’s gaze fell on them, their expressions shifted; they were enemies of hell and also rivals with the Tianyuan Sect. Though hell was their top foe, in this small world, Luo Tian’s group was the strongest. Now aligned with Zhou Zhiwen, if he wished, they could annihilate them.

They now understood Zhou Zhiwen’s importance—Tianyuan Sect and hell both sought to court him.

“I want his life; Senior Luo, assist me!” Zhou Zhiwen coldly spoke, his expression turning icy as he gazed at Bai Yao, who had been struck by Wang Xiu.

“Good!” Luo Tian said nothing, his demonic cloud wings unfurling, vanishing into the void.

“You dare!” Several celestial disciples roared, but merely shouted—temporarily unwilling to clash with Luo Tian.

*Plop…*

Blood spattered; the Rending Heaven Spear pierced Bai Yao’s chest. Bai Yao’s face still bore resentment, blood gushing from his mouth.

Too fast—demonic cloud wings combined with Huangquan Steps and a piercing spear shot left Bai Yao no chance.

*Annihilation!*

Luo Tian extended his hand, a roar echoing as Bai Yao’s lifeless body hung on the spear.

“Damn!” The celestial faction grimaced, while hell’s forces dispersed, surrounding them.

“Senior Zhou, if you say the word, we’ll help you eliminate these trash!” Ye Qiu addressed Zhou Zhiwen.

Zhou Zhiwen’s eyes flashed with coldness, scanning the celestial disciples before finally speaking: “Treat people kindly.”

The scene stilled. Yet Luo Tian and hell’s group kept their gaze on the celestial faction, making them shiver—especially when seeing Bai Yao’s corpse on Luo Tian’s spear.

“Go!” They exchanged glances, realizing the situation was against them. They ascended, rushing toward the black hole—leaving Jiang Yuzu, Ye Liangchen, and Ye Chen behind.

“Get out of here!” Ye Qiu’s group barked, surrounding the three.

“But Senior Ye, you too—get in!” However, Ye Qiu’s words were met with Luo Tian’s cold voice, causing them to hesitate.

“Still want to fight?” Luo Tian sneered, gazing at Ye Qiu’s group with disdain. Now that the celestial faction was gone, no one would interfere.

*Boom…*

As tensions flared again, a surge erupted—when the celestial faction rushed toward the black hole, that chaotic force exploded outward.

“Ah…” Shouts echoed as several celestial disciples roared, their divine light flickering against an unseen force. Yet they were powerless; their bodies twisted as the World Heart’s power pulled them into the black hole.

“Resisting is futile!” As the force expanded, Luo Tian’s group was also dragged in—despite their best efforts, they could not resist.

In an instant, Luo Tian felt the atmosphere shift unnaturally—no pain, yet as if trapped in a space.

Diao Dezhu and others were the same—bodies twisted, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

The terrifying pull dragged everyone into the black hole; the cosmos returned to stillness.

Yet Bai Yao’s corpse gradually revived, eyes flashing with endless hatred.

“Thankfully, I was given a life-saving technique!” Bai Yao murmured, gazing at the now calm black hole—perhaps because he was a corpse, he hadn’t been pulled in.

“Luo Tian, Zhou Zhiwen—this grudge I’ll never forget!” Bai Yao roared beneath the cosmos.

“Unfortunately, you won’t have the chance!” As Bai Yao’s words ended, the cosmos twisted—another figure emerged from the vortex, a black light piercing Bai Yao’s forehead.

“Ugh…” Bai Yao stood motionless, eyes still bewildered, blood trickling from his mouth.

Dressed in gray robes, a youthful face—his single presence caused the black hole to tremble, pulling him in. Yet his expression remained composed.

*Crash…*

Luo Tian heard a roaring in his ears, his body numb. The familiar surge told him he had been struck by lightning.

*Boom…*

Luo Tian felt his feet solidify; the surrounding scene appeared before him. The thunder roared, countless lightning bolts converging on him, striking his body.

“Ah…”

Luo Tian roared, unable to react—his entire body was repeatedly struck by multicolored lightning.

Luo Tian felt his internal organs torn apart, lightning coursing through his body.

Smoke rose from his body as he activated his domain to temporarily withstand the apocalyptic lightning, suffering greatly. Even an Immortal King’s strength nearly failed against it.

Like raindrops, lightning clashed against his domain, sparks exploding—granting Luo Tian a brief respite. He quickly retrieved a pill, gazing around.

“What place is this?” Luo Tian wondered, the surroundings filled with lightning—feeling oddly familiar.

“Thunder Sea Marsh!” Luo Tian gasped, recognizing the place. The scene before him was unmistakably the Thunder Sea Marsh of the Nine Domains.

“How is this possible? Did the Nine Great Perils not vanish, but instead be absorbed into this black hole, changing?” Luo Tian pondered. If it were the original Thunder Sea Marsh, he would have no fear—able to swallow its lightning.

Yet these bolts, even Luo Tian felt a threat—none in the Nine Domains could withstand them.

*Crack…*

As Luo Tian pondered, his domain was shattered by countless lightning bolts, fragments scattering. Lightning surged toward him again.

Meanwhile, the celestial and hell factions faced the same fate—each peril surrounding them, each capable of inflicting significant harm.

“What place is this? A mere small world—yet it holds such perils?” Ye Qiu wielded his Jueyun Sword, slicing through black and white qi, eyes wide with shock.

Divine and demonic forces coalesced into countless divine and demonic soldiers, surrounding Ye Qiu tightly—making it impossible for him to move.

“Damn! Isn’t this the Cliff of Severing Gods!” Diao Dezhu stood on a green path, gazing at the surroundings, shouting in surprise.

Chapter 2745: The Completion of the Thunder Yang Eye ()

Amidst the vast thunder, Luo Tian stood, countless lightning bolts raining down like raindrops, exploding overhead.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, scanning the surroundings—everywhere was lightning, an apocalyptic aura preventing his spirit from extending beyond a hundred zhang. He could not fathom the Thunder Sea Marsh’s true scale.

“If it were its former range, that would be problematic!” Luo Tian mused, beginning to walk. Though he had once entered the Thunder Sea Marsh, this version was unrecognizable.

“Need to find a safer spot—otherwise, prolonged exposure may injure me!” Luo Tian decided, beginning his journey through the lightning ocean.

Ordinary lightning could not harm Luo Tian, but some contained overwhelming power—shattering his domain and striking him. *Boom…*

A black lightning bolt shattered before Luo Tian, spewing blood from his mouth. He activated his cultivation technique, absorbing the black lightning into his eyes.

“Ah…” Luo Tian roared, blood streaming from his eyes, yet his pace did not slow. He pressed forward through the Thunder Sea Marsh.

*Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye!* Luo Tian had his plans—this eye had two levels. He had previously mastered one, but the Thunder Sea Marsh was an ideal place to refine it. Naturally, he would not waste this chance.

Time passed slowly; lightning grew denser. Luo Tian struggled to maintain his domain, yet cracks formed across it—easily shatterable with a touch.

“This lightning exceeds World Power!” Luo Tian sighed internally, his eyes golden, surrounding them with flickering thunder.

…

In another direction of the Thunder Sea Marsh, a figure sat cross-legged, his aura surging. Occasionally, lightning struck him, causing him to grimace in pain—but his eyes gleamed with excitement. This was Yin Wu.

Yin Wu’s situation was far better than Luo Tian’s; he resided in a place where lightning was sparse—only occasional bolts striking him.

“Truly a good spot!” Yin Wu’s body was lacerated by lightning, yet his eyes brimmed with excitement.

Refining his body was the first step upon arriving at the Thunder Sea Marsh—Yin Wu had planned to use these lightning bolts to refine his body, as his cultivation technique was one of physical refinement. These lightning bolts were the perfect choice for refining his body.

“If I stay here for two or three months, my flesh may rival an Immortal King’s peak!” Yin Wu murmured, not daring to leave immediately—continuously enduring the lightning’s洗礼.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian walked for a day, finally finding a spot with less lightning—allowing him to catch his breath.

A green stone lay before him; Luo Tian sat upon it, panting heavily. His eyes were closed, two lines of dried blood streaking his face.

“This is truly difficult…” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with fire, as if pricked by needles. Even with his eyes closed, lightning continued to fall, striking him—finally absorbed into his eyes by his cultivation technique.

“Truly painful! If only I was born with a good eye, I wouldn’t suffer so much!” Luo Tian sighed internally, envying the divine eyes of Mo Tian and Ye Qiu.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian continuously refined various lightning bolts, enhancing his Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye.

Others also faced perils in different regions, encountering various dangers and opportunities.

Three days passed; the Thunder Sea Marsh remained turbulent. Luo Tian sat on the stone for three days, humming…

Suddenly, he opened his eyes—two golden lights flickered. As his eyes opened, the falling lightning seemed to be guided by an unseen force, twisting and veering elsewhere.

At this moment, his eyes resembled two blazing suns, with a thunder pattern at their edges—thunder seemed to wander within the suns.

This was terrifying! If anyone saw Luo Tian’s eyes, they would be stunned into silence. Luo Tian smiled, feeling his eyes had changed.

The apocalyptic lightning around him no longer seemed so fearsome—Luo Tian sensed he could briefly command these lightning bolts.

“Let’s go! I’ll see what happened in this Thunder Sea Marsh!” Luo Tian spoke softly, walking through the lightning.

Time passed slowly; after an hour, he had not encountered a single human—only countless fragments of bones scattered about.

“Haha, I’m invincible now!” As Luo Tian walked, a loud laugh echoed—making him pause.

“Someone’s here!” Luo Tian raised his brow, stepping toward the source of the laughter. Yin Wu, eyes filled with joy, stood there—enduring lightning’s洗礼, feeling his body had grown stronger.

“This is truly my lucky place! If I stay a while longer, my flesh will surely rival an Immortal King’s peak!” Yin Wu was excited. Four days had refined his body to the late-stage Immortal King level.

Yin Wu felt he needed a catalyst—once it arrived, his body would break through.

“Hmph?” As Yin Wu was excited, golden lights appeared in his vision—making him pause.

“Is there someone else here?” Yin Wu murmured, but soon relaxed—after all, they had all entered the black hole together. Others being here was normal.

“This lightning is so fierce—only someone exceptional could reach this place!”

“I’m incredibly strong now! If it’s the celestial faction, I’ll test my newly refined body!” Yin Wu’s eyes gleamed with excitement.

Yet the next moment, his eyes widened in disbelief—because the lightning surrounding him violently trembled.

Two beams of divine light, dazzlingly bright, appeared—someone approached him. The apocalyptic lightning seemed to part for this person.

“Too blinding!” Yin Wu, seeing the golden light, felt his eyes sting—only a blurry figure approached.

“Ah, an old friend!” Luo Tian had already seen Yin Wu; he smiled lightly. At this moment, they were merely a thousand zhang apart—Luo Tian appeared before Yin Wu in an instant.

“Luo… Luo Tian…” The sudden appearance of Luo Tian stunned Yin Wu, who then felt a shiver.

“My god, why am I so unlucky!” Yin Wu mentally cursed, no longer wanting to test his body.

Among those who entered this small world, the one least desired to meet was Luo Tian!

Chapter 2746: Breakthrough ()

“Luo, Senior Luo!” Yin Wu’s eyes reflected bitterness. Now surrounded by lightning, though it could not harm him, it hindered his movement—Luo Tian’s speed would easily catch up.

“Go!” Seeing Yin Wu, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with lightning—surrounding lightning bolts erupted, condensing into serpents of lightning that struck Yin Wu.

“What’s going on!” Yin Wu’s eyes widened, staring at the lightning approaching him—his scalp prickled, and without hesitation, he turned to flee.

Yin Wu’s speed was fast—but could it surpass lightning?

*Boom, boom, boom…*

The thunderous sound echoed; lightning bolts exploded where Yin Wu had stood. Yin Wu’s back was struck by dozens of lightning bolts, emitting a continuous puff of smoke.

“Ah…” Yin Wu roared, surprised Luo Tian had attacked him immediately upon meeting—showing no mercy.

Feeling the searing pain on his back, Yin Wu was grateful he had enhanced his body—otherwise, that strike would have severely wounded him.

“Fast runner!” Luo Tian stomped the ground, thunderbolts below him parting to allow faster movement. Another dozens of lightning bolts struck Yin Wu, making his scalp tingle—no longer caring about the lightning ahead, he fled desperately.

“Luo Senior, let’s talk!” Yin Wu shouted while running, mentally cursing himself for meeting this demon.

“Friendship? Where is the friendship? Your hands are stained with the blood of Tianyuan Sect members!” Luo Tian sneered, chasing Yin Wu and controlling lightning to continuously strike him.

“I had no choice! The master’s command—” Yin Wu replied, his heart bitter.

Yin Wu had truly regretted it this time. Previously in the Ghost Swamp, Yin Wu’s mission failed and he returned to Wuhua Sect—had vowed not to attack Tianyuan Sect. But the Wuhua Sect Master refused, ordering him to lead the sect’s elite to attack Tianyuan Sect.

“Killing one of Tianyuan Sect members means I’ll never forgive you. Once your hands are stained with the blood of Tianyuan Sect disciples and elders, you and I, Luo Tian, are enemies!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, his eyes filled with killing intent as he controlled lightning to strike Yin Wu.

Yin Wu was no doubt a disciple of the Wuhua Sect—though struck by Luo Tian’s lightning, he still had escape potential.

Yet Yin Wu looked pitiful—his clothes were torn and bloodied, his body riddled with wounds.

“Luo Tian, for our old friendship, let me go!” Yin Wu roared, feeling he could not endure much longer.

An hour had passed—Yin Wu nearly perished several times, resisting the urge to use his life-saving technique but enduring it.

“Five hundred and more lightning bolts—yet he endured!” Luo Tian murmured, sighing at Yin Wu’s prowess as a disciple.

“Can’t let him go!” Luo Tian coldly replied, continuing to strike. The two chased each other through the thunder.

Another hour passed; Yin Wu’s aura weakened, his body wrapped in multicolored electricity.

*Crack…*

A clear sound echoed from Yin Wu’s body, causing his already slowed movement to suddenly accelerate. *Boom…*

The lightning blocking Yin Wu’s path shattered, leaving Luo Tian momentarily stunned.

“His body has broken through…” Luo Tian was speechless, gazing at Yin Wu—now battered and unrecognizable. His wounds slowly healed.

“I…!” Yin Wu felt like crying, both sad and happy—sad because these few hours were agonizing, every moment on the brink of death; happy because this brink had triggered his potential, allowing a breakthrough that would have taken months to achieve in just hours.

“This is too damned painful!” Yin Wu mentally cursed; if not for his resilience, he would have already perished.

“Haha, Senior Luo, thank you!” Yet Yin Wu decided to provoke Luo Tian—suddenly standing firm, allowing the lightning to strike him.

Lightning crackled; Yin Wu raised his head and laughed, feeling a sense of relief.

*Boom…* Yet as Yin Wu laughed, he felt a sharp pain in his chest—his throat tasted blood, and his internal organs trembled. His body fell to the ground.

“You forgot—this lightning is merely one of my techniques!” Luo Tian’s figure flickered, appearing beside Yin Wu. He delivered a punch—sixfold轮回拳 (Sixfold Reincarnation Fist).

Yin Wu’s face paled; he sprang up, striking a punch at Luo Tian. Their fists collided.

*Crack…* Thunderous sound echoed, an invisible wave radiating outward from their clash. Lightning bolts around them shattered—Yin Wu’s body was sent flying, this time much better—no longer lying on the ground.

“Damn! I need to run!” Yin Wu cursed, mentally scolding himself for showing off before Luo Tian—his overconfidence had led to this.

“Don’t show off, or lightning will strike you!” Yin Wu felt as if he had eaten dirt—suddenly turning and resuming his escape.

Luo Tian continued chasing Yin Wu, occasionally striking him with lightning—several bolts also hit Yin Wu.

Another three hours passed; Yin Wu’s body, already somewhat recovered, was once again riddled with wounds.

Severely wounded! Yin Wu felt his eyelids drooping, clearly at his limit.

“Someone!” As Yin Wu nearly gave up, in his blurred vision he saw a shadow—without hesitation, he rushed toward it, praying the figure was from hell.

*Boom…*

With all his strength, even burning some cultivation, Yin Wu rushed toward the shadow.

“Nobody can help you! I’ll kill them all!” Luo Tian sneered, also seeing the shadow. As they approached the figure, almost instantly, both reached it—seeing a figure seated in the lightning.

The thunder around them ceased; they were no longer under attack. A depression-like area appeared within ten thousand zhang, untouched by lightning.

“Fan Tianyin!” Both recognized the figure—Yin Wu’s eyes lit up with joy. Fan Tianyin, seated by the pool, looked surprised—turning to see Yin Wu and Luo Tian approaching with hostility.

Chapter 2747: Thunder Pool ()

“Damn!” Fan Tianyin cursed, watching Luo Tian and Yin Wu rush toward him. He leaped into the pool before them.

At the same time, Luo Tian and Yin Wu reached the pool’s edge—stopping immediately. Luo Tian did not rush to attack Yin Wu but focused on the pool.

Lightning flickered within the pool, yet it differed from external lightning. Most captivating to Luo Tian was a seven-colored flower at the pool’s center—its petals, composed of seven colors of lightning, floated within the storm.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed—this thunder marsh should have no life, yet he sensed vitality from the flower. The lightning within the pool seemed to be its nourishment; Luo Tian could clearly feel it absorbing lightning, growing stronger.

“Immortal-Reviving Herb!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed—instantly sensing a powerful aura. This was the Immortal-Reviving Herb.

“This herb must have fully matured!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with joy—this treasure was rare in the celestial realm, a divine artifact capable of granting another life.
