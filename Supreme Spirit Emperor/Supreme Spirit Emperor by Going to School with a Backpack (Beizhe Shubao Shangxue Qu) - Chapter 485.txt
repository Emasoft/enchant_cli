“F***!” However, the next moment, people's faces turned grim as they looked toward the platform where the dust had settled.

Cen Hongwei's mouth spewed blood, his face ashen as he collapsed onto the ground. His gaze turned toward Luo Tian, who was walking away.

"Luo Tian, you're truly formidable! You are the top of the Dragon War Rankings!" Cen Hongwei shouted, but his eyes carried a look of frustration. He gritted his teeth, glaring at Luo Tian's back with resentment.

This was a plan they had previously agreed upon. At first, Cen Hongwei had refused, but Luo Tian had pressured him with his status and even invoked Xuan Dan, forcing Cen Hongwei to comply. The thought of Luo Tian's words made him want to vomit.

"This..." Everyone was stunned by the result. They had expected a fierce battle, perhaps even Cen Hongwei subduing Luo Tian.

Who could have imagined that the mighty Cen Hongwei had been defeated by a single slap from Luo Tian? So swiftly, so effortlessly—leaving people momentarily dazed.

Cen Hongwei let out a cold snort before leaping into the air, chasing after Luo Tian with an even more resentful gaze.

"Master, you did well! Rest assured, your uncle will compensate you!" Luo Tian's face bore a satisfied expression. He hadn't expected Cen Hongwei to cooperate so readily, saving him the trouble of fighting.

Cen Hongwei's eyes burned with fury, but he said nothing. His lungs felt like they were bursting; this was the first time he had encountered such brazen arrogance.

"Chen Hongwei, Luo Tian, Zhao Ritian—come to the hall immediately! Follow me to Luan Tian Sect!" Just as they were about to leave, Li Changfeng's voice echoed through the Tianmen Sect.

"Luan Tian Sect!" Upon hearing Li Changfeng's words, Luo Tian's expression shifted slightly. He wondered what purpose Li Changfeng had in leading them there.

"Did Luan Tian Sect kill our Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe?"

"Is the Master going to seek justice for our two seniors?" Li Changfeng's words stirred unrest among the Tianmen Sect disciples.

"Indeed, Luan Tian Sect dares to kill our sect's disciples. They are truly bold!" The Tianmen Sect disciples rallied, their eyes alight with excitement. A sect defending its disciples was a powerful unifying force.

"Why did they call us all?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He wasn't eager to meet Guan Hongsheng just yet.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian leapt into the air, joining Cen Hongwei as they flew toward the Celestial Peak.

Not long after, Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei arrived at the Celestial Peak. This time, they didn't see the other senior elders—only Li Changfeng seated there, his eyes smiling. Zhao Ritian had arrived earlier and stood respectfully before Li Changfeng.

"Respectful greetings, Master!" Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei bowed slightly, their gazes on Li Changfeng.

"Did you defeat Cen Hongwei?" Li Changfeng asked with interest, his smile betraying a hint of amusement.

"It was just trickery; Cen Senior's courtesy made it easy," Luo Tian replied respectfully. Anyone with eyes could see how he had won.

"This trip to Luan Tian Sect is primarily for intimidation. It might not be peaceful, but it's also an opportunity to broaden your horizons. After all, the three of you will enter the Middle Three Heavens soon. Compared to the Lower Three Heavens, the Middle Three are far more vibrant—where myriad sects vie for supremacy," Li Changfeng said with a sigh.

"Master, I will not disappoint you!" Zhao Ritian vowed. With ZHU Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe both dead, he had ascended to third place.

"Hmph. Just watch and learn. If nothing goes wrong, Luan Tian Sect will yield," Li Changfeng chuckled, stepping out of the hall.

"Roar..." As soon as Li Changfeng appeared, a roar echoed through the air. A massive cloud of dark clouds formed in Luo Tian's group's view—a dragon over a hundred zhang long descended from the sky.

"This is our sect's strongest beast, which recently reached the half-step True Immortal realm," Li Changfeng said softly.

"Um... Master, are we just four going?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion. How could one Li Changfeng intimidate them?

"Master Li's power is boundless! How could Luan Tian Sect withstand his might? Are you questioning Master Li's strength?" Zhao Ritian scoffed.

"Silence!" Hearing Zhao Ritian's words, Luo Tian's eyes turned cold as he addressed Cen Hongwei. He hadn't expected Xuan Dan to have defeated Zhao Ritian, yet Zhao Ritian had grown more jealous of him.

"It seems I need to find a chance to eliminate this man," Luo Tian mused, his gaze lingering on Zhao Ritian.

"Smack..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Cen Hongwei's eyes flashed with resentment. But recalling Xuan Dan's words, he gritted his teeth and took a step forward beside Zhao Ritian. His black hand swung fiercely.

"Ugh..." Zhao Ritian was caught by the throat, lifted like a chicken and shaken rhythmically.

"Enough..." Li Changfeng's lips twitched. He hadn't expected Cen Hongwei to obey Luo Tian so readily.

"Smack..." Upon hearing Li Changfeng's words, Cen Hongwei hurled Zhao Ritian to the ground. Within moments, Zhao Ritian was once again a pig's face.

"Luo Tian... I'll kill you someday!" Zhao Ritian roared internally, his eyes burning with fury. This was the third time he had been beaten in days.

"Rest assured, I would not have brought you here if I couldn't ensure your safety," Li Changfeng smiled, then waved his hand, leading Luo Tian and the others onto the dragon.

"Roar..." The two massive wings flapped, wind howled, and the dragon soared into the sky. Under the reverent gazes of the Tianmen Sect disciples, it flew toward Luan Tian Sect.

Chapter 1873: Re-entering Luan Tian Sect ()

The massive dragon soared through the sky. Li Changfeng stood proudly atop the dragon's head, while Luo Tian, Cen Hongwei, and Zhao Ritian stood behind him, their robes fluttering in the wind.

After seven days of flight, the four finally arrived at Luan Tian Sect. Seeing its vast mountain peaks, Luo Tian's eyes darkened with contemplation.

"Buzz..." The half-step True Immortal aura from the dragon spread out, instantly sweeping over Luan Tian Mountain and activating its protective array.

"Where is that bloodstained scent?" Li Changfeng's brow furrowed slightly. Though time had passed, he still sensed the bloodstained scent.

"Guang Hongsheng, come out and meet me!" Li Changfeng stood on the dragon's back, his gaze authoritative. His True Immortal early-stage aura pressed toward the protective array.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound rose from Luan Tian Mountain, and the golden protective array trembled violently.

"Buzz..." Before Li Changfeng's words had finished, three beams of light shot into the sky. Li Changfeng, Fan Tianming, and Mei Gueqi appeared in the air.

"Li Changfeng, what business do you have at Luan Tian Sect?" Fan Tianming shouted, his gaze carrying annoyance. Especially when he saw Luo Tian behind Li Changfeng, his eyes flashed with overwhelming killing intent.

"Son! How dare you return to Luan Tian Sect!" Mei Gueqi shouted, his gaze on Luo Tian, voice icy.

"Why can't he come? You Luan Tian Sect recently killed our Tianmen Sect disciples. This matter must be explained to me!" Li Changfeng's face was cold, his sneer deepened as the pressure toward Luo Tian's group intensified.

"Explanation? Li Changfeng, are you bullying us too much?" Upon hearing Li Changfeng's words, Fan Tianming laughed bitterly and retorted.

"Although Luan Tian Sect is not as strong as Tianmen Sect, we are not a soft plum to be squeezed. We kindly gifted you flying disciples, but you let your disciples run wild in Luan Tian Sect, causing heavy losses—thirty thousand disciples and elders! Even our senior elder Yao Tianming was killed!"

"This matter, we didn't go to your sect for an explanation. Now you come demanding one? Do you think Luan Tian Sect has no strength?" Fan Tianming shouted, unyielding even before the Tianmen Sect's leader.

"Hah!" Upon hearing Fan Tianming's words, Li Changfeng didn't seem surprised but laughed.

"You mean one of our sect's elders and several disciples killed thirty thousand disciples and a half-step True Immortal elder?"

"Fan Tianming, are you senile?" Li Changfeng laughed loudly. Who could believe such a claim?

"You..." Upon hearing Li Changfeng's mockery, Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi turned red-faced. Li Changfeng's words were indeed true.

In recent days, they had desperately suppressed the news to prevent it from spreading—it was too embarrassing.

"Come on... Luo Tian, tell me how you killed thirty thousand disciples and killed Yao Tianming!" Li Changfeng smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood with his head down, fists clenched tightly. They were within a hundred zhang of Guan Hongsheng, and Luo Tian felt that subjugated sensation again.

"Master, I simply incited their beasts to revolt and summoned a True Immortal-level ghost king along with four half-step True Immortals. As for Yao Tianming, he chased me and I killed him," Luo Tian said softly, speaking the truth. He knew Li Changfeng wouldn't believe it.

"Fan Tianming, is this the case? If you don't give me an explanation today, prepare for Tianmen Sect's army to descend upon you!" Li Changfeng spoke again, his voice commanding.

This was the first time Luo Tian had seen Li Changfeng so强势. Previously, in Tianmen Sect, Li Changfeng had seemed amiable.

"You..." Upon hearing Luo Tian and Li Changfeng's words, Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi nearly vomited blood. Luo Tian's words were truthful, but no one would believe them.

"What? Hurry up and settle this! If you don't satisfy me, prepare for your sect to be annihilated!" Li Changfeng's face curled into a cold smile, his domineering voice echoing over Luan Tian Sect.

Luo Tian observed Guan Hongsheng constantly, trying to figure out how to resolve this situation. However, he noticed Guan Hongsheng's expression was calm and composed, as if detached from the situation.

"Could this old man have another trick up his sleeve?" Seeing Guan Hongsheng's expression, Luo Tian felt a slight tremor. He knew Guan Hongsheng was cunning; if he had let Luo Tian and Duan Chengfeng go back, he must have anticipated Tianmen Sect's retaliation.

"Hah... Li Xiong, what business has brought you so much anger?" As Luo Tian pondered, a breaking sound echoed.

"Hmm?" Li Changfeng's brow furrowed slightly as he looked toward the streak of light approaching.

"Roar..." The dragon beneath Luo Tian's group growled, its massive eyes wary.

Light flashed, and three figures appeared in Luo Tian's group's view. The three wore gray robes: an old man, a middle-aged man, and a youth.

The old man's eyes were deep and thin, his entire body devoid of any color. A gray squirrel sat on his shoulder, clutching a gray fruit and gnawing it constantly.

"That's a soul!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, sensing the gray fruit was a soul.

"Few beasts feed on souls; this is a Soul-Eating Squirrel, an Upper-Grade Beast!" Luo Tian instantly recognized the beast.

"Si Ma Xiu, what business do you have at Luan Tian Sect?" Li Changfeng clearly recognized the old man, his expression shifting.

"Si Ma Xiu!" Upon hearing Li Changfeng's words and seeing his solemn expression, Luo Tian immediately knew the man's identity.

The head of the Di Men Sect, Si Ma Xiu—Luo Tian had only heard of him but never met.

"Hah... Today is indeed lively!" As Li Changfeng's words finished, a series of breaking sounds echoed. A tiger's roar shook the sky as a massive tiger descended from above, with several figures standing on its back.

The leader was also an old man, but Luo Tian felt explosive power from him—after all, Luo Tian specialized in his body.

"Peng Tiantian, you've also come?" Li Changfeng's eyes narrowed slightly, sensing Luan Tian Sect might have been prepared.

"Li Changfeng, is it only you who can come?" Peng Tiantian laughed loudly, his voice thunderous.

"Buzz..." Before Li Changfeng could respond, a series of breaking sounds echoed from all directions.

"Zhen Tian Ge, Wang Zi Zhen pays homage to the three sect leaders..."

"Xue Long Lou pays homage to the three sect leaders..." A series of figures appeared in Luo Tian's group's view.

Upon hearing these voices, Luo Tian's face darkened slightly. These sect names were all top-tier in the Lower Three Heavens, each matching Luan Tian Sect's strength.

Figures moved, and a series of figures stood in the sky. The leaders were all early-stage True Immortals without exception.

"There's trouble ahead. These people clearly didn't come by chance!" Luo Tian muttered internally, his gaze on the figures rising into the sky.

"Everyone has arrived. Please come to Luan Tian Sect for a chat," Guan Hongsheng smiled, gazing at everyone.

"Li Changfeng, calm down. Since you've come, let's talk properly!" Peng Tiantian smiled slightly, addressing Li Changfeng.

"Fine. I'll see what tricks you have!" Li Changfeng sneered, stepping into Luan Tian Sect.

Numerous early-stage True Immortals flew down toward the sect's hall, while Luo Tian and his group remained still, exchanging glances.

"Done for! The Master really dared to go in! This atmosphere isn't good at all!" Zhao Ritian trembled, speaking.

"Hongwei, who are these people?" Luo Tian smiled slightly, addressing Cen Hongwei. At the same time, Cen Hongwei exchanged glances with those young men, his gaze on a youth in white robes.

White robes fluttered; the youth's face bore a smile, his handsome features framed by a green long sword on his back. His gaze locked onto Cen Hongwei.

"Crack... Crack..." Cen Hongwei clenched his fists, his eyes blazing with overwhelming killing intent. His eyes turned blood-red as he stared at the youth.

"Does this person have a grudge against you?" Luo Tian sensed Cen Hongwei's unease, addressing him.

"Cen Hongwei! I didn't expect it to be you! I've heard of Tianmen Sect's top prodigy, Cen Hongwei. I thought it was a coincidence!" The white-robed youth smiled, gazing at Cen Hongwei.

"Li Piaoyun!" Cen Hongwei gritted his teeth, then leapt into the air toward the youth.

"Li Piaoyun?" Luo Tian's brow furrowed slightly. He had heard of this name before—Di Men Sect's prodigy.

"Ah, Cen Hongwei was from Di Men Sect?" Luo Tian guessed internally. The person who had such hatred for him must be the brother who betrayed him.

As Luo Tian pondered, Cen Hongwei's figure had already appeared beside Li Piaoyun. A black long sword materialized in Cen Hongwei's hand, slicing toward Li Piaoyun.

However, Li Piaoyun remained smiling, allowing the black sword to strike his body.

"Boom..." The next moment, Li Piaoyun's body turned into a cloud of white smoke, vanishing from sight.

"The top prodigy of Tianmen Sect is nothing more than this!" Li Piaoyun's voice echoed faintly in everyone's ears.

"His movement speed is astonishing!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, even he could only sense Li Piaoyun's movement trajectory.

Chapter 1874: Stalemate ()

"Ah..." Cen Hongwei roared continuously, his black sword slicing repeatedly. A series of black sword qi swept through the heavens and earth.

"This is the ultimate realm?" Several youths stood at a distance, watching the black sword qi and sensing Cen Hongwei's power.

"Boom... Boom..." Each residual image shattered, each sword qi annihilating a shadow of Li Piaoyun.

"But not even a single hair of Li Piaoyun's was harmed!" The youths whispered among themselves, watching Cen Hongwei seemingly lost in madness.

"Cen Hongwei, why are you attacking me? We were once brothers!" Li Piaoyun's voice echoed in the void, ethereal and elusive.

"Cen Hongwei, I'll kill you!" Cen Hongwei roared, his hands gripping the sword tightly. He plunged it fiercely into the ground beneath him.

"Buzz..." The black sword erupted with ten thousand feet of dark light, a series of sword qi sweeping outward. Within a thousand zhang radius around Cen Hongwei, the area was filled with black sword qi. Not even a fly could escape through it.

"Li Piaoyun, come out and fight!" Cen Hongwei roared continuously. Yet the sword qi still failed to harm Li Piaoyun.

"Cen Hongwei, do you truly wish to kill me? You should thank me! Don't you hate your parents the most? After they cast you out, I also killed them. Originally, I wanted them to accompany you, but you survived and became Tianmen Sect's top prodigy!" Li Piaoyun's voice echoed faintly, laced with contempt.

"This isn't working! Should I help this man?" Luo Tian's gaze fell on Cen Hongwei, who was desperately maintaining the sword qi. The consumption was immense; if prolonged, Cen Hongwei would surely collapse.

However, Luo Tian had his own concerns. If he helped Cen Hongwei, the man's inner resentment would never be resolved—just like how Luo Tian had once had the chance to let Lei Yonghe and Ji Chen kill Li Xiuping but chose to do it himself.

"Hey, what are you three doing outside?!" As Cen Hongwei went mad, a stern voice echoed through Luan Tian Sect. Simultaneously, True Immortal pressure enveloped them, and several golden hands emerged from Luan Tian Sect.

"Boom..." The black sword qi shattered, Cen Hongwei's eyes red as he stared at Li Piaoyun emerging under the immense pressure.

Yet Cen Hongwei did not attack again. A golden hand seized him, Luo Tian, and Zhao Ritian, pulling them into Luan Tian Sect.

A grand hall with imposing presence—numerous elders sat there, the atmosphere tense. Luo Tian and his group stood behind Li Changfeng.

Other prodigies also stood behind their respective elders, their gazes respectful.

"What's going on? Why are you fighting?" Li Changfeng furrowed his brow, clearly unpleased with Cen Hongwei's actions.

"年轻人, high spirits. It's natural to spar when they meet!" Si Ma Xiu smiled slightly.

"Breath... breath..." Cen Hongwei panted heavily, his eyes fixed on Li Piaoyun. If not for the pressure in the hall preventing him from acting, he would still have attacked Li Piaoyun.

"Enough... stop this. You can't kill him by staring. Your survival is bizarre; that's why you were tricked. I didn't expect you to be so impulsive!" Luo Tian smiled, standing behind Li Changfeng and transmitting his words to Cen Hongwei.

"You bastard!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's transmission, Cen Hongwei gritted his teeth. At this moment, he was on the verge of madness; hearing Luo Tian's words made his eyes even more frenzied.

"Want revenge? Stay calm!" Luo Tian sneered, then said nothing more. He knew this scene was unusual—these people had come to Luan Tian Sect, and Li Changfeng didn't know about it. But he had coincidentally arrived at the same time as them to trouble Luan Tian Sect. A fool could see these people had come for Li Changfeng's group.

"Hey, what are you all doing outside?" Li Changfeng's face curled into a cold smile. Even facing several old men of the same True Immortal early-stage level, he remained fearless because Li Changfeng stood behind Tianmen Sect. If anything happened to him, it would be an unending war; no one in this hall could withstand Tianmen Sect's wrath.

"Li Sect Leader, it was a coincidence. We didn't mean to target you. We've come with another matter to discuss!" An old man in True Immortal level spoke, his voice gentle.

"Li Sect Leader, do you have confidence in the Battle for Heaven?" Guan Hongsheng smiled, casting a glance at Luo Tian before addressing Li Changfeng.

"No..." Li Changfeng shook his head lightly, a hint of confusion in his eyes—what did Guan Hongsheng mean by this?

"Neither do we from Di Men Sect or Tie Men Sect!" Li Changfeng's face bore disdain. Among the three sects, Tianmen Sect's strength was nearly equal.

"So Li Sect Leader, if our Xue Long Lou joins your Tianmen Sect?" A old man in blood-red robes spoke, his gaze on Li Changfeng.

"What do you mean?" Upon hearing the old man's words, Li Changfeng's eyes flickered. He seemed to understand why these people had gathered here.

"Exactly, we want to merge sects and enhance the strength of the three sects!" An old man spoke.

"Li Sect Leader, can this gesture ease your anger?" Guan Hongsheng smiled slightly, his gaze deep and meaningful toward Li Changfeng.

"Terrifying..." Upon hearing Guan Hongsheng's words, Luo Tian was stunned to the core. He hadn't expected Guan Hongsheng to come up with such a plan.

Clearly, these sects merging hadn't intended to inform Li Changfeng beforehand. But Guan Hongsheng had timed it perfectly, gathering these people when Li Changfeng came to trouble Luan Tian Sect. Thus, Li Changfeng would inevitably be involved.

Imagine if Di Men Sect and Tie Men Sect merged with other major sects, their strength would inevitably surpass Tianmen Sect. And Tianmen Sect wouldn't even know—how terrifying that would be.

Li Changfeng's brow furrowed slightly; he realized he might have been outwitted by Guan Hongsheng. Though annoyed, he couldn't help but feel grateful to Guan Hongsheng—had he not come, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"Fine. This matter is settled. From today on, Tianmen Sect and Luan Tian Sect have no grudge!" Li Changfeng nodded after a brief pause.

"Deep scheming indeed!" Luo Tian had always known Guan Hongsheng's cunning, but now he elevated him to the most dangerous level. Even surpassing his strongest opponents—unwittingly, he had been outmaneuvered.

And even more so, Guan Hongsheng had manipulated Li Changfeng without a single complaint. Guan Hongsheng was the most calculating person Luo Tian had encountered.

"If Jiang Nanxuan were here, perhaps his intelligence could match Guan Hongsheng!" Luo Tian muttered internally. At this moment, he longed for his brothers—each with their own unique traits. Together, Luo Tian was confident they could reach the Middle Three Heavens.

"Hah... Li Sect Leader truly has a grand vision! Now everyone can discuss how to merge!" Guan Hongsheng laughed heartily.

"You all had it planned already, didn't you!" Li Changfeng's gaze flickered toward Peng Tiantian and Si Ma Xiu, his expression cold.

"The Battle for Heaven is only about life or death, not victory!" Luo Tian suddenly felt this phrase. Though the Battle for Heaven hadn't started yet, the situation in the Lower Three Heavens had already become tense. Even the three sects were beginning to scheme against each other, all vying for that one spot in the Battle for Heaven.

"We Xue Long Lou are a reputable sect and won't merge, but we can ally with other sects. Once in the Middle Three Heavens, we'll dissolve ourselves!" The blood-red-robed old man spoke, his gaze smiling.

"Exactly! We can temporarily obey the three sects' arrangements, but complete submission and division are impossible!" Other sect leaders spoke in unison.

"Hmph. State your conditions then," Peng Tiantian smiled coldly, knowing that to make a horse run, you must feed it grass.

"What conditions? If you can enter the Middle Three Heavens, you'll gain great benefits. We've already given you enough face by not swallowing you!" Si Ma Xiu's expression was also contemptuous, while Li Changfeng sat there as if pondering something.

"I won't join, Master Guan! You all decide for yourselves!" Guan Hongsheng spoke first. Luo Tian knew that Guan Hongsheng must have confidence that regardless of the outcome of the Battle for Heaven, Luan Tian Sect would rise.

Disputes followed; the hall erupted into arguments as a group of True Immortals vied for interests, their faces red and necks swollen.

Luo Tian had no interest in this; his vast spiritual sense spread outward, his gaze filled with confusion.

"Son, are you searching for that ghost king?" As Luo Tian's spiritual sense spread out, it collided with another spiritual sense.

Hearing this voice, Luo Tian straightened slightly, his gaze now serious. This voice was from Guan Hongsheng.

"I'll help you release the ghost king soon. Whether you can catch it depends on your own skills!" Guan Hongsheng's voice echoed again, and Luo Tian's face shifted slightly.

"Don't transmit to me; the old man from Di Men Sect can hear transmissions!" Guan Hongsheng reminded again, then fell silent.

Luo Tian clenched his fists, his eyes unreadable. Guan Hongsheng's words seemed to be for his benefit, but the tone carried a strong sense of condescension—like bestowing something to a servant.

"A servant? One day, I'll make you regret it!" Luo Tian roared internally, standing resolutely behind Li Changfeng.

Chapter 1875: Urgent Need ()

"Master, I need to go out for a moment—I have to urinate!" Luo Tian addressed Li Changfeng, observing the ongoing arguments.

"Hmm?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Li Changfeng's face showed confusion—why would he say such a thing?

"Urgent need, really! In front of so many elders, he chose such a reason to leave!" Several youths' faces showed disdain, mocking.

In their eyes, Luo Tian and Zhao Ritian were merely Cen Hongwei's accompaniments. Compared to them, they still fell short.

"Go ahead!" Li Changfeng nodded. Here, Luo Tian wasn't needed; it was a matter for the elders.

"Come on, Cen Senior, you also wanted to go to the bathroom, right?" Upon Li Changfeng's approval, Luo Tian ignored the youths' mockery and forcibly pulled Cen Hongwei out of the hall.

"What are you doing?" Cen Hongwei's eyes flashed with intense anger, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

"Nothing special—didn't you forget what Xuan Dan's master told you? Protect me, always follow me!" Luo Tian sneered, invoking Xuan Dan to pressure Cen Hongwei.

"Breath... breath..." Cen Hongwei's chest trembled violently, his breathing heavy. If not for this person being Xuan Dan's younger brother, he might have already drawn his sword to kill him.

"Enough, don't be angry. I let you out for your own good! If you stayed inside, you'd eventually die of anger!" Luo Tian didn't argue further, walking along the mountain peak.

"Luo Tian..." As Luo Tian stepped out, the Luan Tian Sect disciples and elders waiting for orders on the mountain peak immediately noticed his presence.

"What is he doing here? Hurry and check if those beasts are secured!" Someone spoke immediately, while others rushed toward the beast prison with a sense of urgency.

"Luo Tian, what are you up to?" Others also surrounded him with a sense of urgency, as Luo Tian had left a deep impression on them.

"Nothing, just strolling around. Now we're very harmonious; you should do your duties!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing the surrounding Luan Tian Sect disciples.

Cen Hongwei stood expressionless behind Luo Tian, suppressing his hatred. After realizing the situation, he noticed a Luan Tian Sect disciple with anger on his face, looking at Luo Tian like a plague.

"What did he go through in Luan Tian Sect?" Cen Hongwei felt curious, observing the disciples' fearful gazes. It seemed Luo Tian had done something that enraged everyone.

Suddenly, a thought arose in Cen Hongwei's mind, but he shook his head, deeming it too unrealistic.

"Move aside! Don't block the way!" Luo Tian kept walking, while simultaneously activating the Yugui Yin to locate the ghost king.

Soon, Luo Tian's eyes brightened slightly; he sensed the ghost king's presence. Though it was daytime, the ghost king had now reached True Immortal level—capable of existing even in daylight. However, his strength was weaker than at night.

Luo Tian walked forward, following the direction guided by the Yugui Yin toward the ghost king's location. The Luan Tian Sect disciples watched him cautiously, showing no intention of leaving, as if facing an enemy.

"You all still don't have enough?" Luo Tian addressed the disciples and elders, scolding them.

"Rustle..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's scolding, people retreated slightly, watching him cautiously.

"Don't you dare follow me again! I won't be polite if anyone dares to attack me. Now, since our sects are in peace, I would be killing you for nothing! Master Guan definitely won't do anything!" Luo Tian threatened again, walking out of the crowd.

However, no one blocked his path this time; they even cleared a road for him.

"That's better! Do you want to kill me?"

"I really like your look of wanting to kill me but being unable to!" Luo Tian laughed arrogantly, walking out with Cen Hongwei.

"This demon—everyone must be cautious!" As Luo Tian walked away, the Luan Tian Sect disciples became chaotic again. They couldn't forget what he had done recently.

Apocalypse, Luan Tian Sect had never been so embarrassed by a single person in its history. People recalled that day's rioting beasts and countless ghostly creatures, shivering with fear.

Luo Tian ignored their thoughts as he walked through Luan Tian Sect's path, turning left and right until he finally found a cave. Two disciples of Luan Tian Sect guarded the entrance.

"Hongwei, go and knock out these two!" Luo Tian addressed Cen Hongwei, taking advantage of the free labor.

"Smack... smack..." Cen Hongwei extended his hand, sending two sword qi from his fingertips into the youths' bodies. The Luan Tian Sect disciples collapsed onto the ground.

"Protect my safety; if anyone dares to attack me, you kill them!" Luo Tian spoke again to Cen Hongwei. Before he could respond, Luo Tian stepped into the cave.

"Ah..." A chill wind swept through as Luo Tian entered the cave, feeling a cold atmosphere.

"This Luan Tian Sect truly invested heavily!" Luo Tian didn't go deeper but sat cross-legged at the cave's entrance, activating the Yugui Yin. He could sense this cave was ideal for ghostly creatures.

"Buzz..." Black mist emerged from the Yugui Yin, gradually spreading into the cave's depths.

"Roar..." A familiar ghostly cry echoed from the cave's depth, making Luo Tian smile.

"It seems these guys want to subdue these ghosts too. Indeed, these five ghosts could match two True Immortals!" Soon, Luo Tian found the ghost king and not only that—four half-step True Immortals were also in the cave.

"Return to their rightful owner!" Luo Tian muttered, and the Yugui Yin emitted a series of humming sounds. Several powerful black mist waves drifted out from the cave.

"Why is it so cold..." Cen Hongwei stood outside the cave, shivering slightly, then glanced inside. His eyes widened in shock.

In his view, several figures stood beside Luo Tian—black humanoid ghost king and four half-step True Immortals.

"This... this..." Cen Hongwei trembled, staring at the ghost king and four ghosts. Each of them could kill him effortlessly.

"Danger..." Cen Hongwei shouted, rushing into the cave. Xuan Dan had previously instructed him to protect Luo Tian's safety.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian furrowed his brow slightly, surprised that Cen Hongwei had entered. After all, the ghost king and four ghosts could easily deal with him.

"Nothing..." Luo Tian waved his hand, retrieving the ghost king and four ghosts into the Yugui Yin. He smiled.

"This..." Cen Hongwei, upon entering the cave, witnessed Luo Tian retrieving the ghost king. His face turned incredulous, his eyes filled with shock.

"How did you do it!" Cen Hongwei trembled, now viewing Luo Tian differently.

"I told the truth before—Luan Tian Sect indeed had thirty thousand disciples and elders indirectly killed by me. I did it by releasing these five!" Luo Tian smiled, the ghost king and four ghosts returning giving him more confidence.
