Luo Tian's words were indeed truthful. He had no desire to refine elixirs below the fourth rank. The ones he sold to Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Hao Ran were merely leftovers from his initial practice.

"Luotian, this is too expensive!" Chen Changsheng quickly waved his hands in refusal.

Luo Tian was merely a person he had hired for assistance, yet within this cave-space, they had gained nothing while Luo Tian had already invested much.

Chai Xiangming, Jing Bolan, and Feng Tianxiong all bore expressions of gratitude as they gazed at Luo Tian in silence.

"External matters! We are a team, and it is only natural for us to support one another!" Luo Tian waved his hand dismissively.

Luo Tian's words struck Chai Xiangming and the others with a profound sense of shame, as if they wished to vanish into the earth.

At this moment, Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Hao Ran felt as though they had swallowed excrement. From the very start of purchasing elixirs, both had been led by Luo Tian's nose, and their hatred for him had already reached its peak.

"We're leaving!" Pang Hao Ran's face was dark with anger, his expression dripping with resentment. He approached the unconscious Tuobai Ye and placed an elixir into his mouth before giving Luo Tian a cold snort, leading Ying Hongtu and the others up the stairs to the third level.

Seeing Pang Hao Ran ascend to the third level, leaving him alone, Tu Yu Zheng's expression darkened further. He cast a deep glance at Luo Tian before following suit. At this point, the immediate priority was to seize the Thunder Heaven Mirror; no matter the loss, it would be worth it.

"Let's go as well!" Luo Tian said to Chen Changsheng and the others.

Chen Changsheng did not object. The immediate priority was to pass through the remaining levels of the Locked Spirit Tower; otherwise, there would be no point in discussing anything else.

Under Luo Tian's urging, Chen Changsheng and the others accepted the fourth-rank elixirs scattered on the ground before ascending the steps to the third level.

As soon as he entered the third level, Luo Tian sensed a familiar fluctuation and landed on the ground.

In an instant, he sprang up and vanished from his original position.

A cold killing intent swept through Luo Tian's heart, followed by a glint of frost appearing on the ground where he had just landed.

Luo Tian silently sighed, grateful for his quick reflexes; otherwise, he would have been expelled again.

"Buzz..." A faint fluctuation of spiritual energy. Luo Tian's expression changed, and his body moved again.

"Hmph! My first expulsion was due to my carelessness. Now that I'm prepared, how could you succeed again?" Luo Tian coldly muttered as he gripped his crackling spear.

The sound of impact echoed repeatedly. Luo Tian's spiritual awareness finally revealed the form of the guardian in this level—a frail old man-like automaton.

Though Luo Tian could detect the automaton, its speed was incomparably superior to his. Whether in movement or attack, it left Luo Tian battered and embarrassed.

Luo Tian's physical strength and spiritual energy were the best among his peers, yet he had one critical weakness: speed.

Though he possessed a metal-elemental affinity, it was far inferior to Ying Hongtu's thunder-element and Leng Qiuchan's dark-element. Moreover, he had never learned any movement techniques. Though his speed was slightly better than ordinary warriors, compared to his peers, he was clearly lacking.

"Boom..."

Luo Tian's figure appeared on the second level's ground, his face filled with astonishment. He had never seen such speed before—truly the pinnacle of the Body Refinement realm, surpassing any he had witnessed.

While astonished, Luo Tian relied on instinct to dodge the automaton's attacks. Yet his body was constantly grazed by that cold light.

Chapter 222: Movement Techniques

Chapter 222: Movement Techniques

Luo Tian had never felt such frustration before, as if he had encountered an early-stage Bone-Refining master of the Xuan Yin Sect outside Dian Forest. However, this automaton had not inflicted wounds upon him but instead left a chill in his heart.

Frustrating, so frustrating. He possessed immense strength but could not unleash it, forced to passively defend while unable to evade. Though he knew where the opponent was, his body could not keep up. Although the automaton had caused him no harm, this was the first time he had suffered a loss against an equal, leaving him deeply resentful.

Time passed. Luo Tian continued to retaliate but failed to land a single hit on the opponent. He was certain that if he had managed even one strike, the opponent would not have withstood his attack.

"Failure!" The automaton's cold voice echoed.

A chill swept across Luo Tian's neck, and a sudden displacement force sent him flying out again.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's figure fell onto the second level's ground.

He shook his head, dazed from the automaton's rotation. He looked up at the open space and noticed Leng Qiuchan, who was closing her eyes to recover spiritual energy.

Seeing Leng Qiuchan, Luo Tian felt a slight surprise. He had only seen her twice before; he did not know what she and the three black-cloaked men had done to endure so long.

Feeling Luo Tian's presence, Leng Qiuchan opened her eyes. Upon seeing Luo Tian, she was momentarily stunned. She had known that Luo Tian might have entered the Locked Spirit Tower since he wasn't present on the second level.

Yet she was surprised to find that Luo Tian had been expelled so quickly. She asked, "How did you come down so fast?"

Hearing Leng Qiuchan's cold voice, Luo Tian wore a bitter smile. "Don't mention it; I encountered some trouble."

"Speak!" Leng Qiuchan's eyes, barely visible, showed interest.

"I don't know your situation. I was stopped at the fourth level by a fast automaton. Its speed was truly the pinnacle of Body Refinement. I'm not skilled in speed, so I came out!" Luo Tian sighed softly, now more than ever longing for a movement technique.

"Movement techniques?" Leng Qiuchan gazed at Luo Tian, her eyes thoughtful.

Luo Tian was also pondering how to solve this issue. For a moment, the second level fell into silence.

Leng Qiuchan's face showed a brief struggle before she bit her red lips and spoke softly, "Perhaps I can help you."

"Oh?" Hearing Leng Qiuchan's words, Luo Tian's face slightly brightened. He knew her identity was unusual; perhaps she had a movement technique.

Seeing the hope in Luo Tian's eyes, Leng Qiuchan's gaze turned resolute. She produced a jade slip in her hand.

"Fengtian Seven Steps!" Luo Tian accepted the jade slip, reading the four large characters on it with a puzzled expression.

"Quickly memorize it and return it to me!" Leng Qiuchan's cold voice urged Luo Tian.

"Ugh, what treasure technique is this? So solemn!" Luo Tian flipped through the technique casually. Though he felt "Fengtian Seven Steps" was bold, he didn't take it too seriously.

However, when Luo Tian carefully examined the technique, he was speechless. A description of "Fengtian Seven Steps" appeared in his mind.

"Fengtian Seven Steps, a Ground-Level Technique!" Upon seeing the four characters of "Ground-Level," Luo Tian's face was filled with shock, his gaze on Leng Qiuchan speechless.

The rarity of a Ground-Level Technique in the Tianyuan Continent was clear to Luo Tian. Take the Five Elements Sect, for instance; it would be rare to find even a few Ground-Level Techniques within the entire sect. Luo Tian knew Leng Qiuchan's identity was not ordinary, but a Ground-Level Technique would be a treasured artifact for her family or sect.

He extended the jade slip back to Leng Qiuchan and said softly, "This is too precious; I cannot accept it."

"Take it!" Leng Qiuchan's cold voice commanded, her gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

Hearing Leng Qiuchan's resolute tone, Luo Tian was stunned again. He stood there, unsure how to respond.

"Big man, don't be so hesitant. Tu Yu Zheng and the others have already reached the final level. You're still lingering here?" Leng Qiuchan spoke.

Seeing Leng Qiuchan's resolute gaze, Luo Tian felt a warmth in his heart. He softly said, "Thank you."

After saying that, Luo Tian no longer hesitated and began to carefully study "Fengtian Seven Steps." The more he read, the more astonished he became. He marveled at the strength of this Ground-Level Technique. This was his first learned Ground-Level Technique, and prior teachings from Lu Kunpeng on spiritual awareness techniques did not count since they were merely cultivation methods.

After thoroughly reviewing "Fengtian Seven Steps," he mentally rehearsed the powerful spiritual awareness technique. He extended the jade slip back to Leng Qiuchan's hand.

"Remember, use it only within, don't let my companions see. If you have the chance to go east later, try not to use it; otherwise, you'll get into trouble!" Leng Qiuchan, having confirmed Luo Tian had memorized the technique, took the jade slip and solemnly said to him.

"Ah!" Luo Tian nodded slightly after hearing Leng Qiuchan's instructions.

"As for whether you can master it, that depends on your own insight!" Leng Qiuchan spoke softly and walked towards the stairs of the third level.

"Rest assured, I won't disappoint you!" Luo Tian smiled slightly and watched Leng Qiuchan walking up the stairs, speaking softly.

Her red lips curved slightly beneath her black veil before vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

"Looks like I need to work harder. If I let them fall behind too much, it would be embarrassing!" Luo Tian muttered quietly and strode up the stairs.

A familiar fluctuation arose. In an instant, Luo Tian appeared in the fourth level of the Locked Spirit Tower, his face filled with intense battle spirit.

"Damn it! Grandpa's here!" Luo Tian roared, his feet not stopping. He infused golden-element spiritual energy into his legs.

Ground-Level Techniques were called such for their immense power, and any element could be used—though with varying strength. Naturally, Luo Tian employed his favored golden-element spiritual energy for movement techniques.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's figure instantly appeared on a wall a hundred feet away, his body pressing against it with a dull sound.

He wiped the blood from his nose and wore a bitter smile, silently sighing, "This Ground-Level Technique is really tough!"

A cold sensation swept across Luo Tian's neck again. The sound of failure echoed in the vast space.

Chapter 223: Passing Through

Chapter 223: Passing Through

Luo Tian's figure reappeared in the second level's space, his face slightly contemplative. He took a recovery elixir and strode up the stairs to the third level.

"Buzz..." The familiar fluctuation returned, and a cold atmosphere once again filled Luo Tian's spiritual awareness.

Having suffered two defeats before, Luo Tian dared not be careless. He forced himself to use "Fengtian Seven Steps" and attempted to evade the cold sensation.

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed again. Luo Tian's voice collided with the walls once more.

"This is too hard! My body is so strong, yet I can't even take a step!" Luo Tian moved his body to dodge the automaton's attack, his mind in distress.

"Boom..." Luo Tian again activated "Fengtian Steps," colliding with the wall. He was sent out again, his eyes filled with confusion.

"The speed in that moment is beyond the endurance of ordinary bodies. It's too fast, even able to clearly feel the heat from skin rubbing against air!" Luo Tian muttered quietly.

"Such a technique, I won't believe in it today! Again!" He roared and strode towards the stairs.

The heavy sound of impact echoed continuously from the cold space. Luo Tian was sent out repeatedly, his appearance more disheveled. Yet a fiery warmth spread from his eyes.

As he gradually adapted, Luo Tian no longer collided with the wall every time he activated "Fengtian Steps." He slowly mastered a bit of skill.

"One hour... two hours..."

Three hours passed swiftly. Luo Tian had become increasingly skilled in the first step of "Fengtian Seven Steps."

At this moment, Luo Tian was within the fourth level's space. His eyes were closed. If someone watched, his surroundings would be filled with cold glints. Yet Luo Tian's face showed no tension.

His body moved flexibly within the space, and one could see that every step he took instantly placed him in a corner of the space.

After three hours, Luo Tian had managed to take his first step in "Fengtian Seven Steps." Though the evasion was not yet natural, this speed was sufficient to handle the Body Refinement Ninth-Rank automaton.

Suddenly, Luo Tian opened his eyes. A faint smile graced his lips as he said, "You've tormented me for three hours. Now it's my turn!"

Before his words ended, Luo Tian instantly appeared before a golden automaton elder. His fists filled with spiritual energy exploded.

"Boom..." The golden automaton elder, like a kicked ball, collided with the cold wall, emitting a dull sound.

"Passed!" The voice echoed. Luo Tian's face slightly showed joy but his heart was not satisfied.

"This 'Fengtian Seven Steps' has seven steps. I've only learned one so far. When will I master the remaining steps?" Luo Tian sighed in his heart.

If Leng Qiuchan and her three companions heard Luo Tian's words, they would have jumped up to kill him. They had practiced for years and could only take two steps. Leng Qiuchan, considered a genius in their sect, had taken three steps.

Luo Tian had mastered the first step within just a few hours. This would leave their faces in disarray.

"Still, being able to take this first step means I can now deal with a Bone-Refining Initial Stage master. I'm quite eager to see what level I can reach after obtaining the mysterious bone and entering Bone-Refining!" Luo Tian mused, his figure appearing in the fifth level's space.

"Roar..." A shocking roar awakened Luo Tian.

With experience from the fourth level, Luo Tian instantly activated "Fengtian Seven Steps" and vanished from his original position.

However, Luo Tian was surprised to find no attack landed there.

He steadied himself and cautiously looked around. A turtle-like automaton was lying there, emitting a heavy atmosphere. Its black eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

"Hmm?" Seeing the motionless turtle automaton, Luo Tian's face showed a smile. His mind gradually understood what these trials were testing.

The first-level automaton, though weak in strength, had a self-repairing ability. It was likely an earth-element automaton.

The second-level automaton, which had caused Luo Tian much trouble, was skilled in speed—likely a metal-element one.

This third-level automaton, judging from its heavy atmosphere, was likely an earth-element one. Since it excelled in defense, Luo Tian felt no concern.

Seeing the turtle automaton motionless and lying there, Luo Tian cautiously launched a punch.

The sound of impact echoed. His fist struck the turtle automaton's back, recoiling with a slight tension.

His punch was comparable to a Yellow-Level Initial Stage technique. This was why he had never used the "Fanglong Hand" technique.

Yet, this turtle automaton showed no damage. This made Luo Tian feel that the fourth level was not as easy as he thought.

The old turtle, still lying there, looked at Luo Tian with a human-like disdain and slightly closed its eyes.

Feeling the turtle's contempt, Luo Tian did not take it too seriously. He had many attack methods.

His hands quickly changed positions, and spiritual energy flowed rapidly into his hands. The "Human King Seal" flew out, striking the turtle's back with a heavy sound.

However, soon after, Luo Tian was truly surprised. His "Human King Seal," a Yellow-Level High-Stage technique, had not even harmed the turtle.

"Then let's try again!"

Luo Tian laughed and his hands changed positions again.

"Five Elements Mutual Generation, Human King Seal!"

"Five Elements Mutual Generation! Golden Snake's Wild Dance!"

Two powerful techniques struck the turtle again—Luo Tian's two secret techniques!

As Luo Tian's attacks formed, the old turtle suddenly opened its eyes. Its gaze was filled with disbelief as it looked at the flowing light and the golden dragon formed by the "Crackling Spear."

The turtle's eyes showed a sense of unease. Its thick legs extended from the shell and crawled to the side.

"Trying to run? Too late!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of amusement. His powerful spiritual awareness controlled two terrifying waves to attack the turtle.

Chapter 224: Passing Two Levels

Chapter 224: Passing Two Levels

Seeing the turtle's fear, Luo Tian smiled. His spiritual awareness controlled the techniques to strike the turtle's solid back with a thunderous sound.

"Roar..." The turtle howled, its mountain-like body collapsing onto the ground. Its back cracked under Luo Tian's joyous gaze.

"Passed!" The familiar and cold voice echoed again, sending Luo Tian to the sixth level of the Locked Spirit Tower.

As soon as he arrived at the sixth level, Luo Tian felt a surge of heat that entered his nose.

Cautiously, he took another step with "Fengtian Steps," vanishing from his original position.

However, he quickly realized it was unnecessary. The fourth level's entire space was filled with endless flames.

Though the fire was very hot, it did not greatly affect Luo Tian's Body Refinement. However, his eyes showed a look of tension upon seeing a figure formed from fire.

He casually took an elixir and, since he had consumed too much spiritual energy in the previous two levels, took out a fifth-rank elixir given by Lu Kunpeng to recover.

As the fifth-rank elixir entered his mouth, Luo Tian's spiritual energy instantly recovered to its peak. Before he could marvel at the power of fifth-rank elixirs, a fire dragon rushed toward him, similar to his "Fanglong Hand."

Seeing the familiar fire dragon, Luo Tian's eyes showed tension. He could clearly feel how powerful the fire dragon's explosive power was, far surpassing his "Fanglong Hand."

As he thought, Luo Tian gathered his spiritual energy throughout his body. He silently mused, "This must be a test of the Body Refinement! Such powerful attacks are beyond what ordinary Body Refinement Ninth-Rank masters can endure!"

As he thought, the fire dragon with a fierce aura rushed toward Luo Tian.

The powerful flames made it difficult for Luo Tian to breathe. Five elements flowed in a regular pattern within his body, filling every part of him.

The massive dragon's head seemed to want to swallow Luo Tian whole. It collided with his body, exploding violently.

"Snort..." Luo Tian inhaled sharply. Fire-element spiritual energy invaded every part of his body.

Luo Tian could clearly feel that his hair was burned away. Fire-element spiritual energy rushed into his body through his pores, exploding immediately upon entry.

However, Luo Tian was prepared. Water-element spiritual energy suddenly met it. A painful expression appeared on Luo Tian's face, but the fierce fire-element spiritual energy was blocked. Yet, the destructive power of the conflicting elements still made him suffer.

In a moment's time, Luo Tian endured this torment. At that moment, he was in disarray, his clothes burned to almost nothing.

"Phew... I made it through!" Luo Tian sighed deeply.

"Boom..." As soon as Luo Tian received the fire dragon, the fire sea in the space disappeared. The fire-formed person also vanished into the world as if it had never existed, leaving only a lingering heat.

"Passed!" The displacement force sent Luo Tian out again with a bitter smile.

"Next level must be water!" Luo Tian took the opportunity to change clothes and appeared on the sixth level of the Locked Spirit Tower.

"Rippling..." The sound of waves echoed. Luo Tian stood in water up to half a zhang, only his head visible.

"Indeed! I was right. But what is the test here?"

Luo Tian spoke quietly, not too worried. From the second level, he had known that this test would not take his life but was merely a trial. At most, it would make the tested person endure some hardship.

Luo Tian immersed himself in water. The temperature was not high, giving Luo Tian a rare sense of relaxation after days of fatigue.

Luo Tian waited for the test to arrive, but after a while, no automaton or creature appeared. He lowered his guard slightly. The water's temperature was very comfortable, and Luo Tian comfortably closed his eyes, a wave of drowsiness approaching.

At the moment Luo Tian let down his guard, a transparent fish-like creature slowly swam toward him.

Luo Tian slightly closed his eyes, as if not sensing the fish-like creature's arrival. However, his lips subtly curled.

The fish-like creature circled Luo Tian once and found no reaction. It seemed truly asleep. Suddenly, it transformed into a long ribbon and wrapped around Luo Tian.

"Hmph! Finally, you've made your move!" Luo Tian opened his eyes. His gaze was like lightning as he unleashed a powerful spiritual awareness to crush the ribbon.

The fish-like creature was momentarily stunned by Luo Tian's spiritual awareness.

Luo Tian extended his hand and grabbed the nearly transparent ribbon, smiling softly: "This sixth level is truly simple!"

A warm sensation spread from Luo Tian's hand, enveloping the fish-like creature.

"Zhi..." A mist of water vapor formed, making the entire space hazy.

The fish-like creature struggled within Luo Tian's hand. In plain sight, it transformed into a mist of water vapor and disappeared.

Seeing the fish-like creature's disappearance, Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He realized he had not been transported out and muttered to himself: "Not passed?"

As Luo Tian's spiritual awareness spread again, his gaze became serious. In his spiritual awareness, a fish-like creature appeared slowly and swam toward him.

"This truly corresponds to water's nature—continuous and unceasing!" Luo Tian smiled softly.

If you are continuous and unceasing, then I will cut off your roots!

Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of cruelty. His hands changed rapidly.

"Five Elements Mutual Generation, Fanglong Hand!" A fire dragon flew from Luo Tian's hands. Since it was in water,

The fire dragon immediately emitted a hissing sound, disturbing the water and causing it to move. The fire dragon directly flew toward the newly formed fish-like creature.

"Zhi..." Though it was suppressed by water, the fire dragon successfully turned the fish-like creature into a mist of vapor.

Not waiting for the fish-like creature to reform, Luo Tian's hands changed rapidly again. He would not give it a chance to form again. Another fire dragon roared out.

"One... two..."

Luo Tian seemed boundless, continuously using "Fanglong Hand" to fill the entire space with water vapor. The water level, which had reached his neck, rapidly dropped due to these fire dragons.

After an hour, the entire space was filled with thick water vapor.

"Passed!" The familiar voice echoed, and Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile.

"Having expended all my spiritual energy, I've finally passed!" Luo Tian's eyes showed anticipation, waiting for the displacement force.

Chapter 225: The Final Level

Chapter 225: The Final Level

However, to Luo Tian's disappointment, no displacement force lifted him. The seventh level of the Locked Spirit Tower was silent, with only continuous water vapor.

"Having passed three levels, spiritual energy is granted!" A mechanical voice echoed in the seventh level of the Locked Spirit Tower.

Luo Tian had not yet reacted when a gentle water-element spiritual energy surged, penetrating through his pores into his body.

"Hmm..." Like a mother's hand, it was gentle. Luo Tian could not help but hum, his face showing a look of indulgence.

Luo Tian's spiritual energy, which had nearly been exhausted, instantly recovered. The Five Elements Refining Spiritual Energy technique automatically operated within his body, converting the water-element spiritual energy into other elements. Five long dragons once again flowed through Luo Tian's body.

It was not over yet. Luo Tian did not know what this spiritual energy grant was, but he knew it must be the reason he had not left since the fourth level.

Knowing this would do him no harm, Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground and focused on refining this unexpected treasure.

The half of spiritual energy droplets in his dantian also slowly increased with this spiritual energy.

"One drop... two drops... ten drops..."

"Thirty drops..." After about thirty drops, the water-element spiritual energy gradually stopped flowing into Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian's face showed joy. Thirty drops of spiritual energy droplets would be equivalent to his half a year of hard training.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian was secretly pleased, a fierce fire-element spiritual energy suddenly arrived and rushed into his body through the pores.

Luo Tian's face changed. Although fire-element spiritual energy brought a slight pain upon entering his body, Luo Tian was overjoyed. He had not expected that there would also be fire-element spiritual energy.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian continued to refine it...

Just like the water-element spiritual energy, fire-element spiritual energy caused his dantian to increase by thirty more drops.

Then, earth-element spiritual energy arrived quietly and entered Luo Tian's body, increasing it by another thirty drops.

Luo Tian opened his eyes. His gaze showed great joy. He could clearly feel that the spiritual energy droplets in his dantian had grown significantly. Originally, it was only half full; now it had reached nearly two-thirds. The three elements' added spiritual energy droplets were enough for Luo Tian to train for over a year.

Luo Tian now felt confident. If these spiritual energy droplets in his dantian were all converted into spiritual energy, his spiritual strength would be comparable to a Bone-Refining Mid-Stage master. Compared to a Bone-Refining Initial Stage, it was significantly stronger.

With anticipation in his eyes, Luo Tian took a chance and waited for the remaining two elements to arrive.

However, he did not wait for the gold-element or wood-element spiritual energy. Instead, a door appeared on the high wall of the fifth level.

Luo Tian was not too disappointed. The voice had said that passing three levels referred to the last three he had passed, and the spiritual energy grant was combined with those final three levels' elements. In other words, only by passing the levels consecutively would one receive such a reward.

Looking at the door before him, Luo Tian guessed it must be the entrance to the eighth level.

Seeing that there was no change in the seventh level of the Locked Spirit Tower, Luo Tian did not think further. He pushed open the door and strode through.

After stepping out of the door, it automatically closed and slowly shut.

Not waiting to think further, a loud booming sound entered Luo Tian's ears. He turned around but quickly moved aside.

"Boom..."

A clumsy figure directly collided with the door, emitting a resounding sound.

"Ying Hongtu?" Luo Tian looked at the clumsy figure with confusion.

"Luotian?" Ying Hongtu saw Luo Tian, his eyes filled with disbelief. He had not expected that Luo Tian was the last to pass through the Locked Spirit Tower, and his speed was so fast. Among them, he was the slowest one; he had only arrived an hour earlier than Luo Tian.

Not wanting to deal with Ying Hongtu, Luo Tian's gaze flickered toward the center of the hall.

At that moment, the hall was bustling. Various martial arts techniques hovered in midair, continuously circling and emitting booming sounds.

Luo Tian saw that besides himself and Ying Hongtu who had just crashed in, everyone else was already present. They were surrounding a young man.

The youth's age was not high, and the strange thing about him was the black runes spreading from his face to his body.

The man had sharp eyebrows and a fierce gaze. His body radiated terrifying fluctuations. Though he did not use any martial arts, each punch and kick was comparable to a Yellow-Level High-Stage technique.

Even more astonishingly, the rune-covered youth fought against so many people without a single disadvantage.

"Bone-Refining Mid-Stage?" Luo Tian's face darkened.

"Luo Tian! Come help!" Chen Changsheng, seeing Luo Tian's arrival, showed a look of shock. He had not expected that Luo Tian, who was behind them for so long, could pass through so quickly. He had personally passed through those guardians and knew how difficult they were.

Leng Qiuchan also showed surprise at Luo Tian's figure. That he had passed the third level meant that he could at least take the first step of "Fengtian Seven Steps." In such a short time, he had mastered the first step of a Ground-Level Technique. What kind of insight was that?

Tu Yu Zheng and others were also shocked, but the rune-covered youth did not give them a chance to be surprised. His spiritual energy transformed into large hands, covering the top of the hall and repeatedly pressing down on the several people.

This was the terrifying power of a Bone-Refining Mid-Stage master. A single attack could be equivalent to a Yellow-Level Initial Stage technique.

Though the group was not afraid of Yellow-Level Initial Stage techniques, they could not withstand continuous attacks from them. Moreover, their attacks—no matter how high-level—could not harm the rune-covered youth even a little.

"You are who?" Tu Yu Zheng roared, blocking the spiritual energy hand and shouting.

"Hmph! You can call me Hunji. You killed my clan's people, murdered my grandfather! And you ask who I am? I am a member of the Hun Clan. Today, I will kill you all to honor my clan's souls in heaven!" The black-cloaked rune youth showed a hint of ferocity. A powerful fluctuation spread again among the group.

Seeing Hunji's strength, Luo Tian's face showed a slight tension. However, his aura kept rising.

Ignoring Ying Hongtu who lay there clumsy and beaten, five-colored spiritual energy filled his fists. He rushed toward the group.

Chapter 226: Battle Against Hunji

Chapter 226: Battle Against Hunji

Seeing Luo Tian's arrival, Chen Changsheng and Tu Yu Zheng showed a hint of joy. They had witnessed Luo Tian's combat strength, and they had already vaguely considered him the strongest among their group.

Indeed, for over ten people who were constantly being beaten by Hunji, several had already suffered injuries. Ying Hongtu was even knocked out.

Luo Tian joined the battle, and the situation quickly changed. Using his formidable physical strength, Luo Tian did not care much about Hunji's attacks. He let those attacks comparable to Yellow-Level techniques hit him, while simultaneously launching the "Human King Seal."

Luo Tian was also aware that Hunji might not have been in the outside world. Otherwise, if he had learned even one or two techniques, they would all have been killed today.

A Bone-Refining Mid-Stage master was beyond their current capacity to handle.

While thinking, the "Human King Seal" had already flown from Luo Tian's hands and descended upon Hunji's head, striking him fiercely.

Hunji showed a hint of contempt. He could clearly feel that this seal did not pose much threat to him. His body could easily withstand it, so he did not dodge but instead punched Luo Tian who had just entered.

As for the other people's attacks, they were ignored by Hunji. He let those fierce martial arts attack his body.

"Boom..." The "Human King Seal" fell, and a dull sound echoed on Hunji's back.

"This is what you call martial arts from the outside? Using it on your hands is a waste. If each of you gave me one technique, I could make you die comfortably!" Hunji felt his back slightly numb. He looked at Luo Tian and the others with a smile.

As a Bone-Refining Mid-Stage master, he could sense that Luo Tian brought him some danger. However, it was only a little. His strength clearly did not match these people's level. In a one-on-one fight, he would definitely dominate them.
