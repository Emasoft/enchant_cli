“Let us unite to crush him, leaving no chance for his revival! Then we seize the Celestial Star and end this day!” Watching Luo Tian plummeting into the starry void, four formidable martial techniques coalesced in the hands of the four men before converging upon Luo Tian with a thunderous roar.

A resounding hum echoed through the cosmos as a four-colored dragon surged forth, twisting through the heavens with an earth-shaking surge of power.

“Why strike so mercilessly? Luo Tian had no strength left to fight!” The people of Star River Sect watched the multicolored martial technique torrent with bewilderment.

“Because of the Daoist Heir position!” One voice immediately understood why Ye Tong and his companions sought to kill Luo Tian.

“Everything’s lost!” An elder standing beside Ye Wu Dao in the hall felt a chill of dread, exhaling long and deep before sending a mental transmission.

“This time, I kill you—do you think this is unjust?” Luo Tian’s long sigh echoed beneath the stars. As the four-colored torrent descended, he formed a hand seal, releasing a golden star that surged toward the storm.

At the same time, Luo Tian leapt to his feet, his gaze piercing through the overwhelming martial technique. Ye Tong and his companions instinctively felt a chill of fear.

“Boom…!” A thunderous explosion reverberated through the void as Luo Tian’s golden star was annihilated by the torrent, continuing its relentless assault.

“Kill…!” Luo Tian roared, his voice like thunder—no sign of injury at all. His qi surged violently, radiating an overwhelming aura. His body became a streak of light, charging toward the martial technique torrent.

“Does he seek death?!”

“This is a combined attack from four prodigies! How dare he rely on his body to withstand it?!” All felt the same thought.

Complex patterns flared across Luo Tian’s body before he plunged into the torrent, vanishing from sight.

“Boom…” Just as people assumed Luo Tian was finished, a streak of light pierced through the martial technique torrent and appeared before Ye Tong. A powerful punch surged toward him.

This punch, though seemingly simple, was unleashed with Luo Tian’s full strength—infused with a hint of the Wild Wind Hammer technique.

Double body strength, an unfathomable power. Luo Tian was confident this punch could wound a True Immortal at the initial stage.

The golden fist shattered space, leaving jagged cracks across the starry void.

“Ah…!” Ye Tong howled in desperation. This simple punch had triggered a life-or-death crisis—had he failed to block, he would be dead.

“You dare kill me!” Ye Tong roared, unleashing his full potential. A massive shield materialized before him.

The sound of shattering followed as Luo Tian’s cold expression remained, smashing through the shield and driving his fist into Ye Tong’s body.

Blood splattered across the void, leaving Star River Sect silent. The people gazed in shock at the drifting blood blossoms, their eyes wide with disbelief.

“One punch pierced Ye Tong’s heart!” Their hearts clenched as they stared at the bloody scene.

Ye Tong’s body plummeted into the void, his eyes wide with disbelief.

“Luo Tian, the Daoist Heir, has killed!” One voice trembled. Though Ye Tong and his companions had intended to kill Luo Tian, they hadn’t succeeded—yet Luo Tian had slain Ye Tong outright.

“Fearsome! So fearsome! Ye Tong was but a half-step True Immortal, yet Luo Tian felled him with one punch!” People marveled at Luo Tian’s terrifying might.

“Reckless!” The elders in the hall glared at Luo Tian through the curtain, then turned toward Ye Fu and Ye Xiu with grim faces.

Ye Tong, Ye Fu, Ye Xiu, and Ye Die—four of equal strength, cultivated with great effort. Though not as strong as the chosen Daoist Heir candidate, their deaths still grieved them deeply.

Luo Tian stood like a tiger confronting three sheep—no matter how strong the three were, they could not harm him, only hinder his movements.

“Boom…” Time passed slowly until Ye Xiu could no longer endure, collapsing into blood mist and joining Ye Tong’s fate.

“Husband, come save me!” The sole woman, Ye Die, cried out with a sharp voice, echoing through the starry void.

“Is there anyone left?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing into the stars.

“Little Die, I’m coming!” As Ye Die’s words faded, a figure sliced through the void and appeared on the battlefield. A chilling aura radiated from him. Seeing Ye Die’s pitiful state, the youth’s face turned colder still, his killing intent unhidden as he surged toward Luo Tian.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian felt a sudden sense of danger, his gaze locking onto the youth beside Ye Die.

“Qiu Qian Di!” Ye Fu’s face lit up with joy. Compared to them, Qiu Qian Di’s strength was formidable.

Chapter 2003: Confronting Qiu Qian Di

Qiu Qian Di, a cultivator who ascended from the Three Thousand Worlds. Star River Sect had sought to retain him by betrothing Ye Die to him.

In the Three Thousand Worlds, Qiu Qian Di had been obsessed with cultivation, never taking a companion. After ascending to the Immortal realm, his personality changed—he was no longer a martial fanatic but cherished Ye Die deeply. Anyone who harmed her would face his wrath without mercy.

“You dare touch my woman!” Qiu Qian Di coldly observed Luo Tian’s step forward, an invisible wave of power radiating from him. His battle intent surged toward Luo Tian.

“You’re insane! She wanted to kill me—am I not allowed to fight back?!” Luo Tian gazed at Qiu Qian Di as if viewing a fool, his aura spreading.

Two overwhelming forces clashed like two waves colliding, thunderous roars echoing in the ears of all.

“This time, Luo Tian is doomed! He’s touched Ye Die—Qiu Qian Di would never let him live!” Ye Tong and the others felt excitement.

“Unbeaten!” They knew Qiu Qian Di’s record—since joining Star River Sect, he had never lost. Even Ye Chen had fought him to a draw, and Qiu Qian Di had even dominated him.

At that time, Qiu Qian Di hadn’t yet learned Immortal realm martial techniques; his methods were all from the Dao Realm.

“Husband, help me kill him!” Ye Die’s pale face and disheveled attire bore countless footprints as she roared at Qiu Qian Di.

“Good!” Qiu Qian Di nodded, then took a step forward toward Luo Tian.

Mid-flight, Qiu Qian Di’s hands flashed with light. A green fist surged forth like a mountain of destruction toward Luo Tian.

Body combat—Luo Tian had no fear. He raised his hand, striking with a palm. Instantly, the two clashed.

A fist and palm collided—Luo Tian and Qiu Qian Di both retreated, their eyes darkened with seriousness.

“Not bad!” Qiu Qian Di roared, his speed now even faster. The green fist shattered the stars.

“You’re not bad either!” Luo Tian chuckled, then struck again with a palm.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous roars continued as Luo Tian and Qiu Qian Di clashed before the eyes of Ye Fu and Ye Die.

“My, Qiu Qian Di’s body cannot harm Luo Tian!” Ye Hong and the others stood pale-faced, gazing at Luo Tian.

The two clashed fiercely, their strength unmatched even by those outside who wore expressions of awe.

“This Qiu Qian Di is truly a talent, but he’s not on our side!” Ye Wu Dao muttered internally. He knew Luo Tian’s strength, and Qiu Qian Di matching him meant his power was staggering.

“Warm-up over!” Qiu Qian Di clashed with Luo Tian again, his body recoiling. Though he bore minor cracks, his eyes burned fiercer.

Opponents—this word had not graced Qiu Qian Di’s eyes for a long time. He considered Star River Sect’s talents decent, but if he truly focused, there would be no opponents.

His past years had been spent vying for resources, elevating Ye Die’s strength to the level of a talent—this was Qiu Qian Di’s true terror.

“Nine Moon Grasp!” As he spoke, Qiu Qian Di’s body rose, his blood seeming to boil. His speed surged abruptly, and a jade moon appeared above his head.

“Ferocious God’s Anger! Step Nine!” Seeing the jade moon, Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. A golden foot surged forth, stomping toward the descending jade moon.

“Boom…!” The stars trembled as a violent surge of power radiated outward, the collision of two martial techniques producing an earth-shaking roar. Ye Hong and others turned pale, their faces filled with shock.

“Dao Realm martial technique?” Qiu Qian Di’s gaze flickered, observing Luo Tian. He had also used a Dao Realm technique—convenient to wield. Yet Luo Tian’s Ferocious God’s Step Nine flowed effortlessly, surprising Qiu Qian Di.

“Embrace the Mountain Seal!”

“Ferocious God’s Second Step Shatters Stars!” Qiu Qian Di continued his assault, his martial techniques colliding with Luo Tian’s Ferocious God’s Step Nine.

The entire void was shattered by their clash, Dao Realm techniques proving astonishingly powerful—no less formidable than Immortal realm martial arts.

“We must stop Ye Liangchen!” Ye Fu and Ye Die exchanged glances, recalling their mission. They turned toward the seated Ye Liangchen, whose golden star had shrunk to a radius of two thousand zhang. It seemed on the verge of being fully refined.

Though Ye Die and Ye Fu had suffered heavy injuries, they dismissed the weak Ye Liangchen. They dashed toward him.

“I refuse! I won’t agree!” Luo Tian recoiled, taking a deep breath before sweeping his hand. A golden dragon surged forth from his palm.

“Roar…” The roar echoed, the dragon’s aura overwhelming as it surged past Ye Fu and Ye Die. Its golden tail lashed toward them.

“This dragon!” People gazed in disbelief, stunned that Luo Tian possessed such a technique.

“A King Beast! My King Beast! It has reached the late Immortal stage!” People gasped, awestruck by the mighty dragon.

“Boom… Boom…” The golden tail shattered space, striking Ye Fu and Ye Die with a resounding thud.

This time, they had no strength to fight back—blood spewed from their mouths as their bodies cracked. Had it not been for Ye Hong’s intervention, they would have plummeted into the void.

The golden dragon circled around Ye Liangchen, glaring at Ye Hong and others without advancing further.

“Lord, please forcibly open the Washing Star Pool! Our sect’s talents have already fallen two—no more can be lost!”

“This Luo Tian dares to kill within the Washing Star Pool! Lord, this child must be executed!” The elders in the hall spoke repeatedly, watching Luo Tian clash with Qiu Qian Di. At this moment, Luo Tian had already begun to dominate Qiu Qian Di.

Though Qiu Qian Di was strong, he had spent years in Star River Sect and had become complacent. Luo Tian, however, had never ceased his battles since entering the Immortal realm—his relentless training allowed him to reach the late Immortal stage so swiftly.

“Truly strong!”

“But Luo Tian didn’t know this Washing Star Pool forbids killing, did he?” The onlookers felt fear as they watched Luo Tian and Qiu Qian Di clash.

“Ah…” Qiu Qian Di roared, his body seemingly in a frenzy. His martial techniques surged forth continuously, clashing with Luo Tian’s body.

Yet as time passed, Qiu Qian Di realized Luo Tian’s might and knew he was no match. Blood spewed from his mouth as he retreated, gazing at Luo Tian without further attack, panting heavily.

“This feeling… it’s nostalgic!” Qiu Qian Di’s face bore a wistful expression, his demeanor now more aged.

“Thousand-Year Emperor,” he continued, “in our world, they called me that. I was the first to reach the peak in my world, then ascended to this Immortal realm!”

“From cultivation to ascending to the Immortal realm, I never lost a single battle. Yet now I’ve met you!” Qiu Qian Di gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with admiration.

“One final move—should you block it, I shall have lost!” Qiu Qian Di spoke softly. Green energy surged from his body as he rapidly moved his hands, weaving power that merged with the澎湃 Immortal energy.

A hum resonated as green energy coalesced, forming a jade lotus hovering in Qiu Qian Di’s palm. A formidable pressure radiated from it.

“Ghost-Repelling Seal!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing a dire threat on the jade lotus. He raised his hands, summoning the Ghost-Repelling Seal above his head.

“Go…” Qiu Qian Di pointed, and the jade lotus vanished from his palm. With a thunderous roar, it shattered space.

“My!” The onlookers gasped as the jade lotus’s mere tremor shattered space.

“My husband is invincible!” Ye Die, pale-faced, cried out. Compared to others, she alone understood Qiu Qian Di’s strength.

In the hall, the elders wore tense expressions, gazing at the scene through the curtain. Their complex emotions were twofold: they wished to eliminate Luo Tian but also hoped he survived, fearing Jiang Tai Bai and Jiang Yu Ze’s retribution.

“He deserves death!” After much deliberation, they finally resolved to kill Luo Tian—this position of Daoist Heir was too crucial.

“Boom…!” The cold aura of the Ghost-Repelling Seal clashed with the jade lotus, producing a thunderous explosion. All ears heard a deafening crack as both techniques shattered.

“Roar…” As if ten thousand ghosts howled, the Ghost-Repelling Seal transformed into swirling black mist while the jade lotus became a surge of green energy. Though shattered, both forces continued clashing—green lightning crackled between the two clouds of energy.

Chapter 2004: The Seal Technique Prodigy

The two clouds collided endlessly, lightning raining down as Luo Tian and Qiu Qian Di clashed within the thunder.

As time passed, Luo Tian bore many injuries. Without weapons, both relied on body combat and martial techniques—each punch landed with devastating force, yet neither could overcome the other.

“Truly strong—he matches me in this battle!” Luo Tian sighed internally, striking Qiu Qian Di’s head. Qiu Qian Di countered with a palm to Luo Tian’s chest, both spitting blood.

Compared to Luo Tian’s disheveled state, Qiu Qian Di was near death—his back caved in, his body riddled with blood and wounds. Yet his willpower was indomitable, allowing him to endure.

“Is this Qiu Qian Di the one they cultivated as the Daoist Heir?” Ye Wu Dao observed Qiu Qian Di’s battered state, pondering.

Yet he shook his head—Qiu Qian Di was strong but not a Ye family member. Moreover, Qiu Qian Di’s rebellious nature meant only Ye Die could control him.

“I have lost!” After an hour, Qiu Qian Di appeared beside Ye Die, shouting.

“Though I’ve lost, I shall reclaim this defeat!” Qiu Qian Di, bloodied and wounded, supported Ye Die as he soared into the void. This battle had awakened Qiu Qian Di.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian spat blood, his pale face gazing at Qiu Qian Di’s departure. He did not chase him—knowing Qiu Qian Di was more wounded, and if he pursued, he had an 80% chance of killing him.

Yet Luo Tian adhered to the principle of not pursuing a desperate foe—Qiu Qian Di’s potential was terrifying; he might retaliate.

“Even Qiu Qian Di couldn’t defeat Luo Tian!” People marveled, gazing at the standing Luo Tian.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian chuckled, his gaze turning to Ye Fu and Ye Hong. Qiu Qian Di he could let go, but these people—Luo Tian had no intention of letting them live. Having killed Ye Xiu and Ye Tong, he wouldn’t mind killing more.

“What are you doing? The Washing Star Pool forbids killing!” Ye Fu and others turned pale, but soon realized their words were foolish—Luo Tian had already killed two.

“Killing? You all wanted to kill me too—why do you think I’d face punishment?” Luo Tian sneered, leaping into the air toward Ye Fu and others.

“You’re branch descendants—killing us will surely bring heavy punishment from the elders! Even the Lord won’t protect you!” A youth roared.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed as a mist of blood erupted, splattering onto Ye Hong and Ye Fu. Their bodies trembled uncontrollably.

“Flee!” Several youths shouted, fleeing in all directions—what task mattered now?

“Reckless! Lord, we must forcibly open the Washing Star Pool. If this child continues killing, the entire pool will suffer heavy losses!” The elders’ eyes burned with urgency. This pooling had cost them dearly, achieving nothing but losing two talents.

As for who their chosen Daoist Heir was, they didn’t know—this candidate had always been nurtured by an elder, selected and cultivated in secret. They only provided resources; they never saw his face, masked at all times.

“Open…” The elders leapt up, hands moving as they pointed—green Immortal energy surged from their fingers, coalescing into a star-shaped blade that slashed toward the heavens.

Seeing this, Ye Wu Dao and Ye did not stop them. To open the Washing Star Pool required an hour—Luo Tian had enough time.

The stars trembled as the green star blade descended, causing instability in the pool’s space.

“Finally, they’ve had enough!” Luo Tian smirked, crushing a youth’s neck with one hand. His gaze turned to the remaining people.

“The elder has taken action to open the pool!” The onlookers trembled, hearing a powerful roar beneath the stars.

“Luo Tian, now is your chance to surrender and face justice—don’t make a mistake!” Ye Han roared, his voice passing through a crack into the stars.

“Useless! You couldn’t even handle this!” Among the crowd, a man with a mask stepped forward, gazing at Luo Tian. He spoke softly to himself.

The man’s hand extended, a crimson light flying from his palm—forming into a red sword that soared toward Luo Tian.

“Hum…” At this moment, Luo Tian was chasing Ye Hong and Ye Fu. As the sword flew, he felt a slight chill and turned his head sharply.

A bloodline appeared on Luo Tian’s face—Luo Tian turned, spotting the masked man.

His figure wasn’t tall, even shorter than average. A mask obscured his face. This mask was peculiar—its face wept blood, with eerie eyes peering through it, filled with hatred and endless resentment. It seemed to hate everyone in the world.

“Is it him?” The elders who had forced open the pool gasped, recognizing the masked man.

“The Daoist Heir candidate!” The elders’ minds surged with waves of shock—unexpectedly, the Daoist Heir candidate had entered the Washing Star Pool.

Luo Tian observed the masked man with interest, speaking softly: “You also want to save them?”

“Not really. You’re strong—I’m not your match.”

“But I have a reason to kill them. And your presence truly blocks my path!” The masked man replied, his voice slightly immature but carrying a chill—like nothing could stir this mask-wearer’s emotions, not even himself.

“Who is he?” Hearing the man’s words, Ye Fu and others trembled, gazing at the masked man. They had a vague guess but dared not speak.

“You’re not my match, yet you want to kill me? Why do you have the right?” Luo Tian took a step forward, his hand forming a seal. A thunderous roar followed as the seal pressed down.

“Boom…” The masked man’s figure was struck by the great seal, collapsing into a cloud of dust that vanished from sight.

“Seal technique?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, suddenly turning to spot the masked man dozens of zhang behind him.

“I originally didn’t want to reveal myself, but these guys are too useless—so many people couldn’t kill you. I had no choice but to appear!”

“To kill you, I’ve made full preparations. This trip into the Washing Star Pool—your death is certain!” The masked man waved his hand, a green seal flying from his palm. As it flew, the seal ignited itself.

“Boom…” The burning seal unlocked some restriction. A green star, spanning a thousand zhang, surged toward Luo Tian to crush him.

“A mid-level Immortal realm technique—comparable to a True Immortal’s initial stage!” The onlookers gazed at the green meteor shattering space, their faces filled with awe.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath! Step Nine!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened, his hands moving with precision. A roar of a dragon echoed from him.

“Roar…” A true dragon surged forth, colliding with the green star.

The meteor shattered into fragments, scattering in all directions. The onlookers shouted, fleeing to create a ten-thousand-zhang space for the two to battle.

“Who is he? Why does he wear a mask? Is it to hide his identity?” The people also wondered about the masked man’s identity.

“Is it him?” Ye Wu Dao in the hall wore an eager expression—unexpectedly, this branch’s cultivated Daoist Heir had been lured out.

“I’ve lost—I’m not your match, but I can kill you!” The masked youth waved his hand again, several seals appearing in his palm. He flung them as if they were worthless.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous roars echoed in all directions. A black lightning struck Luo Tian, and it wasn’t over—massive stars, surging waves of water, all attacked Luo Tian.

A total of several techniques—each a mid-level Immortal realm technique, comparable to a True Immortal’s initial stage. Their power was terrifying, causing the onlookers’ mouths to twitch as they retreated ten thousand zhang.

“This is my capital to kill you!” The masked man spoke softly, his hands flinging more seals. Each seal seemed like trash in his hand, constantly thrown out.

This caused the entire void to erupt—everyone gaped wide-eyed as techniques covered a million zhang, annihilating the stars.

“Boom… Boom…” As the masked man flung his seals, Luo Tian moved constantly.

Yet these techniques were too dense—no fly could escape all of them.

“Ah…” Finally, some techniques struck Luo Tian, causing him to roar in pain. His heart was filled with frustration—how could this masked man have so many seals?

“Damn it! Are you treating them as trash? No one throws them like this!” Luo Tian’s scalp tingled, but he could only endure. Fortunately, his skin was thick and tough, enduring the attacks yet still standing.

“Kill him! Kill him!” The elders who had previously forced open the pool now regretted it. Luo Tian was like a grasshopper after autumn—his movements were limited.

Chapter 2005: Leaving the Washing Star Pool

Beneath the collapsing stars, explosions annihilated a million zhang of space, engulfing the void and blocking sight. The power was immense, even warping space.

“This power could kill a True Immortal at the initial stage! It’s too terrifying!” The onlookers trembled, feeling if they entered this storm of techniques, they’d be reduced to nothing in moments.

“Still alive?” The masked man muttered, sensing the life force within the terrifying techniques. He waved his hand again.

Another set of seals appeared in his palm—colorful but with more intricate patterns than before. Under the people’s curious gaze, he held a red brush in his hand, swiftly moving it.

“Hum…” As he moved the brush, complex patterns formed on the seals. A powerful aura surged into people’s minds.

Within a few breaths, an intact seal appeared in the masked man’s palm. He waved his hand, and it transformed into a golden mountain, surging into the technique storm.

“Damn!”

“I didn’t see that right?” Everyone gaped, watching the masked man draw with his red brush.

“Such a short time—how did he craft an early Immortal realm technique seal? This speed is too absurd! No wonder he threw so many seals earlier!”

“Who is this masked man?” Everyone was stunned, never expecting such a talent.

“A terrifying seal technique mastery! Could he be the first seal master, Ke Jiu’s disciple?” Ye Wu Dao and Ye also wore shock.

“Certainly him!” At this moment, Ye Wu Dao was 80% certain the masked man was the one they had long sought—the branch’s cultivated Daoist Heir.

Seals flew endlessly from the masked man’s hands, each technique descending upon them.

“This speed is no slower than casting techniques!” Everyone was stunned by the masked man’s seal-drawing speed—unparalleled in their lives.

Time passed slowly, half an hour elapsed. The masked man exhaled deeply, gazing at the churning stars. His red eyes deepened with intensity.

Explosions echoed beneath the stars, people no longer sensing any life within the powerful explosions.

“Terrifying! Half an hour—crafting hundreds of seals!”

“Though crafting seals consumes less Immortal energy than casting techniques, the ability to craft so many proves this masked man’s Immortal energy is terrifying—exceeding even a half-step True Immortal!” People murmured.

“Regrettable, Luo Tian the Heir! His talent was so great—defeating Qiu Qian Di—but he fell to this obscure masked man!”

“Who is this person? When did Star River Sect produce such a talent?” Everyone was puzzled, wondering who the masked man could be.

“This time, he’s doomed!” The masked man muttered, having expended much energy. Even if Luo Tian didn’t die, he was certain to suffer heavy injuries.

Outside, the elders wore smiles, no longer worried. Yet Ye Wu Dao and Ye bore concern—this masked man’s methods had frightened them both.

Time passed slowly, the smoke gradually dissipating. A figure appeared in people’s sight.

“He’s still alive!” The masked man’s red eyes widened, gazing at the charred body suspended in the smoke—like charcoal.

“Is there still life?” People’s mouths twitched, gazing at the charred body with disbelief.

“My brother—how easy is it for him to die?” Long Jie circled in the void, his massive eyes filled with mockery.

To Long Jie, Luo Tian was the strongest—no peer in his generation could match him. Though the explosion was fierce, Long Jie was confident Luo Tian would survive. No reason—this was their blood bond over years of默契.

“Crack…” A brittle sound echoed as the black charcoal-like body trembled, its outer layer peeling off to reveal a white body.

“Ah… it’s blinding!” Female disciples covered their eyes, yet peeked through their fingers.

“Not dead!” The elders outside gaped, watching the reborn Luo Tian.

“Son, truly a prodigy! Even if Liangchen didn’t feign weakness, he wouldn’t match you. Even Chen would not match you!” Ye Wu Dao laughed, his heart finally at ease.

Two glints of light flashed as Luo Tian opened his eyes, exhaling deeply before sweeping his hand. A robe appeared on his body.

“Close… so close! Fortunately, my Hundred-Forged Body Technique has broken through—otherwise I might not have survived!”

“Thank you!” Luo Tian roared, leaping into the air toward the masked man.

“My condition is far better than yours!” The masked man coldly spoke, no fear—though Luo Tian hadn’t died, he sensed Luo Tian’s Immortal energy was nearly depleted. Only his body remained strong.

“What does it matter?” Luo Tian laughed, his qi vibrant, his body filled with endless strength. He instantly appeared before the masked man, striking a punch.

The heavens changed color, winds of power surged—Luo Tian’s overwhelming body strength was fully revealed.

“Get out…” The masked man roared, sensing danger the moment Luo Tian moved.

Blood-red Immortal energy surged forth, forming into seal chains that wrapped around Luo Tian. In an instant, they collided with his fist.

Yet the masked man knew Luo Tian’s body was unmatched and avoided direct confrontation, instead controlling the blood-red seal chains to wrap around Luo Tian’s arm like a snake, spreading across his body.

“Break!” Luo Tian roared, releasing a powerful aura. The blood-red seal chains began to break.

“Crack…” At the same time, a golden fist struck the masked man’s face. The masked man’s body recoiled violently, his ugly mask cracking.

“Who is it?” Everyone stared at the ugly mask, eager to see who lay beneath—what was his identity?

“Seems I must fight with all my might. Though I know I’m not your match, I still have to try!” The masked man’s long fingers adjusted his mask, speaking softly. Blood flowed from the mask, making its ugly face more grotesque.

“Kill…” A surge of blood energy erupted, the masked man transforming into a demon, his robes turning crimson. An overwhelming resentment radiated from him.

“What immense hatred could create such a surge of resentment!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at the masked man.

A chill invaded the stars, causing everyone to shiver involuntarily. A strange emotion stirred in their hearts.

A blood-red hand formed, crushing the void with a surge of resentment. It slammed down toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian leapt into the air, still relying on his unmatched body strength to withstand it. Though the blood-red hand threatened him, he was confident in his ability to endure.

“Crack…” Yet as the blood-red hand prepared to collide with Luo Tian, black space cracked open. A mysterious suction force spread outward.

The stars darkened as the bright star vanished from sight. Ye Liangchen slowly rose, his aura flashing with golden light. A terrifying pressure radiated from him as he stood.

“Refined it…” The people gasped, gazing at Ye Liangchen as he stood.
