At the same time, those purple insects had just burrowed into Luo Tian’s body. Upon entering, they met the Emerald Crystal Flame. Under its emerald glow, they instantly turned into purple powder, remaining within Luo Tian’s body.

In a brief moment, countless insects transformed into dust, lingering in Luo Tian’s body and causing his spirit to tremble. A look of immense joy spread across his face.

Though the insects perished, Luo Tian had not anticipated that their purple residue would coalesce into a torrent of primal energy. This enhanced his Pill Formation Peak cultivation by an additional fraction.

Chapter 646: The Purpose of the Heavenly Corpse Sect

“Seems that even in great peril, there lies a tremendous opportunity,” Luo Tian mused with a smile. He unleashed a series of fire dragons, surrounding the purple insects that had not yet entered his body.

“Ancestral Flame! Emerald Crystal Flame!” The black-cloaked youth, witnessing Luo Tian’s summoned flame, displayed a look of shock. He had not expected Luo Tian to possess such an extraordinary fire.

In his momentary daze, Luo Tian unleashed nearly a hundred fire dragons, encircling the youth’s insects so tightly that none had a chance to flee.

“Hum…” The purple swarm emitted waves of fear, encircled by the verdant flames. In Luo Tian’s consciousness, their grotesque faces bore expressions of terror; some insects near the flames trembled uncontrollably.

“Fen Tian Li Huo Array!” Luo Tian struck the air with his palm, and a sea of fire instantly submerged the countless purple insects. Within moments, they transformed into swirling violet dust that scattered across the sky.

“Can’t waste this!” Luo Tian chuckled lowly, inhaling deeply to draw the violet dust and Emerald Crystal Flame back into his body.

“Boom…” A series of thunderous sounds echoed within Luo Tian’s body, and his gaze carried a touch of satisfaction.

“Is that all?” Luo Tian wore an amused expression, gazing at the youth. He leapt into the void toward him again.

“Spit!” The youth coughed up blood, for those insects had been his life’s work, intertwined with his soul. Their destruction had wounded him severely, and he longed to devour Luo Tian whole.

“Flee!” The youth’s face bore a momentary resolve; he knew he was no match for Luo Tian. He decided to escape first, regroup with his allies, and then devise a plan to eliminate Luo Tian.

He spat out a drop of blood, which transformed into a surge of power. Simultaneously, his hands moved, and several yellow talismans adhered to the corpses of several Tianyuan Continent geniuses he had slain. They soared toward the horizon.

“Control-Body Talismans?” Luo Tian observed the youth’s talismans, his eyes darkening. Li Xiuping had once used these; they were closely tied to the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Now, seeing them, Luo Tian was certain this youth was also a member of the sect.

“Boom!” A punch erupted, shaking heaven and earth. The control-body talismans on the corpses fell off instantly. Luo Tian, with his Step of Sealing Heaven, appeared before the youth who had escaped ten thousand zhang away. His Wheeling Fist descended again.

The Wheeling Channel reappeared, and a powerful suction force acted upon the youth’s soul as he fled. His body halted mid-flight.

“Come out!” Luo Tian sneered, and his other hand emitted a terrifying suction force, further tormenting the youth’s soul.

Luo Tian’s current strength was monstrous; within a mere dozen heartbeats, the black-cloaked youth’s soul lay in Luo Tian’s grasp, crying out in agony.

“Soul-Search!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed like lightning. His gray soul emerged from his body, and with a mighty hand, he pressed it onto the youth’s soul, silencing its cries.

At the same time, the memories of the black-cloaked youth flooded Luo Tian’s mind, leaving him in awe.

Fifteen heartbeats later, Luo Tian’s soul returned to his body. His eyes held disbelief, while the youth’s soul remained clutched in Luo Tian’s hand, no longer howling. Its gray eyes bore a dazed look.

Luo Tian ignored the youth’s soul’s state, his gaze filled with shock. The revelation from the youth’s memories had stirred a tempest within him.

The entire Western Regions had become entirely under the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s control, surpassing any sect in power. Even compared to the Northern Region, it was immeasurably stronger. This shook Luo Tian deeply.

Moreover, he learned from the youth’s memories that war would soon erupt across the Western Regions, aiming to massacre the entire Tianyuan Continent. The most critical component was the Chronological Book within his own mind.

The Heavenly Corpse Sect’s goal of massacring the Tianyuan Continent was to harness its inhabitants’ blood qi, aiding their sect’s elder in recovering from past injuries on the Ancient Immortal Continent. They also sought to draw out the Chronological Book, using it to open their legendary Chronological Gate and enter the so-called Eternal Realm.

The term “Eternal Realm” was unfamiliar to Luo Tian, but every member of the Heavenly Corpse Sect knew it well. Most had joined the sect lured by its promise of eternal life.

To cultivators, their ultimate pursuit was immortality. Yet Luo Tian knew that even those at the Boundary-Transcending Stage had limits; no one could live forever.

The legend of the Eternal Realm, promising eternal life upon entry, was enough to drive cultivators mad.

After searching the youth’s memories, Luo Tian’s gaze grew solemn. His concern was not merely that the Heavenly Corpse Sect had seized the Western Regions but that if they spread this news, countless people might defect to their cause, aiding in the massacre of the continent and opening that legendary Chronological Gate.

“My goal now is to grow stronger—stronger! Pill Formation Peak isn’t enough. Only by entering the Soul-Formation Stage might I have a chance, and even that may not suffice. Only by reaching the elusive Boundary-Transcending Stage can I possibly stop them!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination.

“Additionally, I must elevate everyone connected to me. The twelve gates of the Ancient Immortal Relic Site are undoubtedly the best choice!” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze turning toward Zheng Xin. With a surge of primal energy, he crushed the youth’s soul and body, annihilating him with the Emerald Crystal Flame.

Then Luo Tian plunged into the cave where the black-cloaked man had previously stayed. He knew this was the residence of Situ Chen!

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s figure appeared beneath the darkness, his powerful spiritual sense expanding. The subterranean scene materialized in his mind.

After ten heartbeats, Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with joy. His hands emitted waves of energy, repeatedly striking the rubble ahead.

In a brief moment, a spacious hall emerged before Luo Tian, and his eyes softened. This was Situ Chen’s cave dwelling—familiar to him from countless times he had entered it as Zhang Daotian.

Chapter 647: The Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword

Luo Tian gazed at the familiar scene, his eyes glistening with tears. He had not expected that after such a fierce explosion, Situ Chen’s cave still remained intact.

His gaze fell upon Situ Chen’s statue, and he knelt in reverence, his eyes filled with respect and memory as he bowed three times.

As he looked at Situ Chen’s statue, Luo Tian recalled how Situ Chen had sacrificed himself to let Zhang Daotian escape. His heart stirred with a quiet sigh: “Master Ancestor, rest assured—I will avenge the entire Heaven-Ordained Sect!”

He rose and surveyed his surroundings. Situ Chen’s cave was still modest, lacking any treasures; time had left it dust-covered.

Luo Tian did not hesitate but cleaned the entire cave before storing it in his storage ring.

“Boom…” After placing the cave into his ring, Luo Tian descended underground, surrounded by rubble and earth. To his delight, a faint light appeared a hundred zhang away.

“Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened with joy. Though buried in earth, its sharp aura was unmistakable. That glimmer was the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword.

He dashed toward the light, pulling it from the earth and illuminating the dark space.

“Familiar feeling!” Luo Tian murmured, running his fingers along the sword’s blade, a soft expression on his face.

“Hum…” As if sensing Luo Tian’s familiarity, the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword emitted a series of resonant hums, its voice carrying sorrowful emotions.

“Master Ancestor must have given all his treasures to his master before sending him through the passage! This Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword is undoubtedly the best treasure of the Heaven-Ordained Sect!” Luo Tian chuckled, storing the sword in his ring before appearing in the sky.

Though the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword was a sect treasure, Luo Tian had no intention of keeping it. He knew Zhang Daotian needed it more—this symbol of the Heaven-Ordained Sect.

“Ha!” A series of laughter echoed in the sky, filled with excitement. These were the Tianyuan Continent geniuses who had once resided in the Heaven-Ordained Sect. Now, they bore smiles, having either ascended in cultivation or obtained valuable treasures.

Luo Tian took a step forward, his spiritual sense locating the cave he had once occupied. A smile graced his face as he punched forward, re-entering the earth below. He observed the surroundings, now devoid of its former opulence.

“Wonder if the eighth-grade elixir I placed under my bed is still there!” Luo Tian’s eyes held a smile as he approached the spot where his bed had been. He skillfully dug into the ground.

“Hmm? It’s still here!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up, gazing at the jade vial beneath the earth. And not just one—there were three!

Luo Tian’s gaze was puzzled; he had only placed one eighth-grade elixir there. Yet now, two more were present.

“Hum…” Luo Tian could clearly sense that the energy of these two vials was even more potent than his original eighth-grade elixir.

“Ninth grade!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled, then softened as he understood. It must have been Situ Chen who had discovered the elixir beneath his bed and, after becoming a ninth-grade alchemist, placed two more.

Luo Tian swiftly collected the three vials. Now was not the time to refine them, as he had other plans.

Standing atop the sky, Luo Tian saw that all the Tianyuan Continent geniuses had emerged. Zheng Xin also looked at Luo Tian with joy.

“Pill Formation Late Stage!” Luo Tian’s eyes held satisfaction as he nodded at Zheng Xin’s aura.

“Let’s go to the Heart-Seeking Sect!” Luo Tian greeted the other geniuses before addressing Zheng Xin. The Heart-Seeking Sect housed Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Leirong. Luo Tian was concerned for Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan’s safety, so he led Zheng Xin toward the Heart-Seeking Sect.

“Let’s go see!” Others, feeling aimless, had come to regard Luo Tian as their leader. They followed him and Zheng Xin toward the Heart-Seeking Sect.

The group marched through ruins, following their memories for three days until they reached the Heart-Seeking Sect’s location.

The Heart-Seeking Sect fared better than the Heaven-Ordained Sect but was still in disarray, having lost its former splendor.

A thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, causing his brow to furrow slightly. His powerful spiritual sense swept outward before turning cold.

His gaze fell upon two groups clashing: one was Leng Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue, the other Jiang Leirong with a group.

The clash of thunder echoed across the ruins, with shattered void traces and various martial arts swirling in the sky.

Leng Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue, working together, had the upper hand against Jiang Leirong. Though Jiang Leirong was a prodigy, Leng Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue were no ordinary opponents. Their teamwork left Jiang Leirong with no advantage.

“Brother, you seem to have trouble!” Zheng Xin observed Leng Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue’s alliance, his face bearing a playful expression as he spoke.

At this moment, Leng Qiuchan had regained her icy demeanor, her face obscured by a black veil. She transformed into a storm of darkness, rushing toward Jiang Leirong.

Gu Qianxue, like an ethereal beauty, wielded a long sword with surrounding energy, charging Jiang Leirong.

“Leng Qiuchan, you two are prodigies—two against one?” Jiang Leirong sneered, stepping on a lotus and countering.

Others also clashed, the scene chaotic. But as Luo Tian’s group arrived, both sides ceased fighting, their gazes turning to Luo Tian’s group.

Jiang Leirong’s face finally changed, her eyes locking onto Luo Tian with hatred. Yet sensing his overwhelming aura, she furrowed her brows deeply. She knew now that she was no match for Luo Tian without a fight, and the thought formed in her mind automatically.

“Leave…” Luo Tian’s voice rang like thunder in Jiang Leirong’s heart, making her face pale.

Chapter 648: His Heart Cannot Accommodate Others

Hearing Luo Tian’s voice, which carried no掩饰 of coldness, Jiang Leirong’s face darkened as if about to drip water.

Though she had previously matched Leng Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue, she had been slightly at a disadvantage. Now with Luo Tian’s arrival, if they fought, she would not survive even one strike.

Luo Tian also sighed inwardly. Considering his feud with Jiang Leirong, he would have surely subdued her before. But knowing of the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s existence, he hesitated to act.

In the Ancient Immortal Relic Site, anyone was a once-in-a-century genius; losing one would be an irreplaceable loss for the Tianyuan Continent. Luo Tian knew their true enemy was the Heavenly Corpse Sect.

Jiang Leirong also wondered why Luo Tian hadn’t attacked her immediately but instead hesitated, allowing her to leave.

But soon, Jiang Leirong realized it. She had some resentment toward the Heavenly Corpse Sect; after living there so long, it was unreasonable to claim no feelings.

With the reason Luo Tian wouldn’t kill her, Jiang Leirong smiled: “This is the Heart-Seeking Sect’s domain. Its inheritance is accessible to all. What right do you have to interfere?”

“I am Jiang Leirong, a prodigy of the Qionghua Sect. What right do you have to order me away?” Jiang Leirong’s eyes held determination as she gazed at Luo Tian.

“Don’t test my patience!” Hearing Jiang Leirong’s words, Luo Tian’s face darkened further, his gaze filled with killing intent toward her.

Seeming to believe Luo Tian wouldn’t kill her, Jiang Leirong felt more at ease. She continued: “I won’t leave today. What can you do to me? I am the Qionghua Sect’s junior master, while you are merely a disciple of the Northern Region’s Five Elements Sect. Killing me would be beyond your sect’s capacity!”

“Don’t take it for granted!” Luo Tian could no longer contain his anger. His body materialized before Jiang Leirong, and the Rupture Spear emitted a resonant sound in his hand, piercing toward her.

The Rupture Spear, in Luo Tian’s grasp, resembled a black lightning bolt, instantly reaching Jiang Leirong.

“Better to be injured!” Jiang Leirong calculated in her mind, yet her eyes burned with battle spirit. Previously defeated by Luo Tian in the Ancient Immortal World, she felt不服.

Though Luo Tian was now overwhelmingly powerful, Jiang Leirong still wished to test herself against him, to see the gap between them.

“Lotus Transformation!” Jiang Leirong did not hesitate, activating it instantly and ascending to the Pill Formation Peak.

“Falling Petal Palm!” At the same time, Jiang Leirong roared, her fingers moving swiftly. Four-colored primal energy coalesced into countless petals, gathering to form a sky-shrouding hand.

“Tier-A Martial Art!” Zheng Xin, Gu Qianxue, and Leng Qiuchan’s faces bore surprise as they watched the hand form in the sky.

A Tier-A Martial Art at the Pill Formation Peak stage carried immense power, its four-colored hand exuding terrifying pressure and waves, striking Luo Tian fiercely.

“Leave!” Luo Tian’s face bore a sneer. He pointed the Rupture Spear toward the sky, emitting a thunderous hum. Golden light pierced through the heavens, directly piercing through the four-colored hand.

“One strike to pierce a Tier-A Martial Art!” People’s faces bore astonishment; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have reached such a level.

“Damn, how much stronger he has become!” Jiang Leirong’s face darkened. She hadn’t expected even one strike to shatter her martial art.

This strike didn’t just pierce Jiang Leirong’s martial art but also shattered the last bit of confidence she had in confronting Luo Tian.

Yet these thoughts were only fleeting for Jiang Leirong; as she was lost in thought, Luo Tian had already arrived before her with the Rupture Spear, piercing it into her heart.

Blood splattered; Jiang Leirong’s face bore disbelief, eyes filled with shock—she hadn’t expected Luo Tian to actually strike her down.

“I gave you a chance!” Luo Tian’s eyes bore coldness. He withdrew the spear, its powerful tearing force shredding Jiang Leirong’s meridians.

“Boom…” Jiang Leirong’s body slowly fell from the sky, her eyes filled with regret as she landed on the ground.

“Dead!” People’s faces bore disbelief.

The Qionghua Sect’s junior master, of such high status, now lay dead at Luo Tian’s hands. The people were shocked by Luo Tian’s audacity.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue’s face bore a smile as she approached Luo Tian, speaking softly without caring about Jiang Leirong’s fate.

In Gu Qianxue’s eyes, she was already Luo Tian’s wife, despite their wedding only being half-attended.

Luo Tian’s eyes softened as he gently held Gu Qianxue’s hand, while his body’s Emerald Crystal Flame transformed into strange seals, entering Gu Qianxue’s body.

“Hm?” Though Gu Qianxue was puzzled, her face showed no fear. Though she felt the fire’s terrifying temperature, her trust in Luo Tian made her stand before him without hesitation.

“I found it!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with joy, discovering a black mark in Gu Qianxue’s dantian. This mark was the restriction placed by the Yumen Sect on Gu Qianxue’s body.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian guided the seals formed by the Emerald Crystal Flame to crush the black mark.

“Sss…” Gu Qianxue inhaled sharply, the intense pain making her instantly drenched in sweat.

“Endure it!” Luo Tian’s face softened, his voice like a spring breeze entering Gu Qianxue’s heart.

Leng Qiuchan stood nearby, her face pale. She had fully recovered and knew what happened in the Ancient Immortal Continent. Her heart felt like it was being cut, tears streaming down her cheeks.

“Ugh…” The blue wolf transformed into a human size, approaching Leng Qiuchan and repeatedly licking her tears.

“Awakened?” Zheng Xin’s face bore a complex expression as he approached Leng Qiuchan.

“Y-yes, awakened… but it’s better to remain confused!” Leng Qiuchan’s eyes flickered. Her voice, once strong, now sounded unusually soft.

“His heart might no longer hold you! Perhaps you should consider Duan Xingchen… he…” Zheng Xin spoke, his gaze turning to Leng Qiuchan.

“Don’t say it! My heart can no longer accommodate others!” Leng Qiuchan recovered, her eyes bearing determination.

Chapter 649: Searching for a Person

Over the ruins of the Ancient Immortal Relic Site’s Heart-Seeking Sect, Luo Tian wore a smile as Gu Qianxue stood gently before him.

“Seems Shangguan Hongtu didn’t lie! The restriction was truly removed! Next time I see him, I won’t beat him!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“He also suffered greatly—repeatedly trampled under your feet!” Gu Qianxue chuckled, acting like a small wife.

“Then what about her?” Gu Qianxue looked at Leng Qiuchan standing nearby, her face bearing a complex expression. She thought of their deep bond in the Heart-Seeking Sect and sighed.

At this moment, Gu Qianxue had no hostility toward Leng Qiuchan but knew she harbored feelings for Luo Tian. Yet, she couldn’t bear to let Leng Qiuchan share Luo Tian with her.

Seeing Gu Qianxue’s gaze, Luo Tian understood what she was thinking. He sighed and turned his gaze to Leng Qiuchan, who still had dried tears on her face. Her black veil clung tightly to her face, and her eyes were red, evoking pity.

“I won’t go over… tell her I can no longer accommodate others!” Luo Tian sighed, his voice carrying exhaustion.

“Ugh…” The blue wolf transformed into a streak of blue light before Luo Tian, its eyes displaying human-like entreaty. It tugged at Luo Tian’s robe toward Leng Qiuchan.

“Little Wolf!” Luo Tian gently patted the wolf’s head, placing a pill in his hand—his one-qi dragon emperor elixir.

Though this elixir was beneficial for dragons, its effects on other beasts were not as great but still significant.

“Take good care of your master!” Luo Tian gently patted the wolf’s head.

“You go and clarify it yourself! Even if you make a decision, I won’t oppose it! Some things can be avoided for a while but not forever. Don’t be a coward!” Gu Qianxue, seeing Luo Tian about to leave, bore a touch of anger.

“Coward!” Luo Tian muttered lowly, then let the wolf tug him toward Leng Qiuchan.

“Are you alright?” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes carrying a smile. At this moment, he truly didn’t know how to handle his relationship with Leng Qiuchan.

“Y-yes, I’m fine!” Leng Qiuchan nodded softly, her eyes fixed on Luo Tian. She longed to run into his arms but knew it was not hers.

“Ah… if, after the battle with the Heavenly Corpse Sect on the Tianyuan Continent, we both survive… if Qianxue and Yunting agree, then…” Luo Tian’s voice carried a bitter tone.

“Enough! I understand!” Leng Qiuchan’s voice bore coldness, returning to her former state.

Luo Tian’s words, though sincere, made Leng Qiuchan feel proud. She couldn’t bear to watch others’ faces; even if she and Gu Qianxue’s relationship was delicate, she couldn’t beg for Gu Qianxue to agree.

“Yunting!” Gu Qianxue’s face showed surprise upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, gazing at him before her expression turned joyous.

“Yes, I have hope to revive Yunting! In the Ancient Immortal Relic Site, I found half of her soul!” Luo Tian caressed his waist’s soul-rearing jade, speaking softly as he recounted the events to Gu Qianxue. She was stunned and happy for Luo Tian, knowing Chen Yunting was a deep-seated issue for him.

“Alright, I’ll go elsewhere. You two stay here to receive the Heart-Seeking Sect’s inheritance. Afterward, meet me at the Heaven-Ordained Sect’s ruins. If anyone comes to bother you, don’t fight back—wait for me!” Luo Tian addressed the two. He wasn’t certain if others would come to seize the Heart-Seeking Sect’s inheritance.

After giving further instructions, Luo Tian and Zheng Xin vanished from people’s sight.

“Qianxue, could you tell me about Chen Yunting?” Leng Qiuchan spoke softly as she watched Luo Tian’s retreating back.

…

Luo Tian and Zheng Xin flew for three days, reaching a mountain peak.

“Unexpectedly, the Dark God Sect remains so intact!” Luo Tian stood in the sky, gazing at the slightly dilapidated hall atop the mountain. He spoke softly.

The Dark God Sect was silent, causing Luo Tian’s brow to furrow slightly before his eyes brightened. His spiritual sense encompassed the entire hall, revealing thousands of people seated on the ground, their faces serene but emitting powerful fluctuations.

Familiar faces appeared in Luo Tian’s spiritual sense, and he was delighted to find not only Shangguan Hongtu but also his elder brother Ji Chen and Ning Qingzhu.

At this moment, these people seemed to be in a trance, seated on the ground without sensing Luo Tian and Zheng Xin’s arrival.

Luo Tian and Zheng Xin sat in the void, their powerful spiritual senses enveloping the entire mountain peak of the Dark God Sect.

Luo Tian’s purpose was not to disturb them but to prevent anyone from interrupting and harming these people.

Others, Luo Tian might not care about, but Ji Chen’s presence compelled him to stay and guard.

Time passed; the sky gradually darkened. As darkness fell, Luo Tian and Zheng Xin opened their eyes simultaneously, exchanging glances to see each other’s expressions of disbelief.

“What is this situation?” Zheng Xin asked, gazing at the dilapidated structure of the Dark God Sect.

At this moment, within Luo Tian and Zheng Xin’s spiritual senses, the entire Dark God Sect seemed to vanish from their perception. They could no longer sense its presence.

“This Dark God Sect’s hall itself is a treasure!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, gazing at the hall.

“Ha! Seems I haven’t arrived too late!” As Luo Tian and Zheng Xin were bewildered, laughter echoed from the sky. A breaking sound followed, and several figures appeared in Luo Tian’s vision.

“Jin Wulong!”

“Zhou Ziyan!” Luo Tian and Zheng Xin’s faces grew solemn. They hadn’t expected to meet these two here.

“Luo Tian? Zheng Xin?” The figures moved, Jin Wulong and Zhou Ziyan’s faces bore confusion as they looked at Luo Tian and Zheng Xin, who had risen.

Chapter 650: Clash of Prodigies

Seeing Jin Wulong and Zhou Ziyan, Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly. Though he had no enmity with them, their presence here was not a good sign.

“Two of you—what’s your purpose here?” Luo Tian asked, his gaze cautious. He could sense the powerful fluctuations within their bodies, making him wary. Especially Jin Wulong’s aura felt like a threat.

Luo Tian was now formidable, confident in his invincibility against peers. Yet the faint sense of danger from Jin Wulong indicated he was equally powerful.

“After collecting the inheritance, I suppose we’re heading elsewhere. Unexpectedly met you here. Do you have no interest in this inheritance?” Jin Wulong’s voice echoed, his battle spirit surging as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“No interest. I advise the two of you not to be interested in this inheritance either. You’ve both reached the Pill Formation Peak—this inheritance might not benefit you much. It’s better to do a favor!” Luo Tian smiled, speaking softly.

“This inheritance isn’t much of a concern. After all, that person inside is quite troublesome. But meeting Luo Xiong, if we don’t spar a bit, it would be quite boring!” Jin Wulong’s face bore caution as he looked at the hall. His gaze fell on a plain-looking youth seated beside Shangguan Hongtu.

“Xiu!” Luo Tian’s gaze followed, then he chuckled softly, inwardly sighing. This Xiu was too ordinary; if Jin Wulong hadn’t mentioned it, he might have overlooked him.

“That’s good!” Luo Tian spoke softly and sat back in the void, his spiritual sense still locked on Jin Wulong and Zhou Ziyan, guarding against their sudden attack.

“Luo Xiong isn’t giving me face?” Seeing Luo Tian ignoring him, Jin Wulong’s face bore anger. His powerful aura pressed toward Luo Tian.

“Jin Xiong is also a sensible person, I suppose you know our main enemy now is the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Why fight?” Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying regret but Jin Wulong’s aura had no effect on him.

“Luo Xiong, your words are off. This is a sparring match, not a life-or-death fight. We’re just exchanging cultivation insights!” Zhou Ziyan’s face also bore a smile, clearly eager for battle.

“These Southern Region prodigies are truly battle enthusiasts!” Luo Tian inwardly sighed but he genuinely didn’t want to fight Jin Wulong. If he won, Jin Wulong’s narrow-mindedness might hinder future cooperation against the Heavenly Corpse Sect.

He had already offended one sect, and relations with the Yumen Sect were strained; he couldn’t afford to offend all Southern Region sects. That would be detrimental for future battles against the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Now, Luo Tian’s focus was solely on the Heavenly Corpse Sect—this was the most important matter.

These prodigies from the Ancient Immortal Relic Site, if they united after leaving, would form a terrifying force.

“Two of you should focus on finding those Western Region people. From what I know, the West has fully become the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s base.” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze cold when mentioning Western Region people.

“Do you hate the Heavenly Corpse Sect?” Jin Wulong’s face bore a smile, looking at Luo Tian’s cold gaze. He was momentarily surprised before asking softly.

“Of course!” Luo Tian nodded, his eyes sincere.

“That’s easy. If you defeat me, I’ll help you. If not, then in the Ancient Immortal Relic Site, you’ll assist me!” Jin Wulong spoke, his eyes filled with excitement. Zhou Ziyan stood beside Jin Wulong, his face bearing bitterness because he had previously been lured by Jin Wulong’s method.

Hearing Jin Wulong’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He looked at Jin Wulong and saw he wasn’t joking. He nodded slightly: “Alright, then I’ll take my leave!”

“Good!” Jin Wulong’s face bore great joy. If he could recruit Luo Tian, his side would become even stronger in the Ancient Immortal Relic Site, allowing them to dominate everyone.

Jin Wulong didn’t waste words; he ascended rapidly into the sky.

Luo Tian observed Jin Wulong’s actions and nodded inwardly. Jin Wulong’s behavior clearly showed he feared their battle’s fluctuations would disturb those receiving the inheritance in the Dark God Sect. This behavior increased Jin Wulong’s favor in Luo Tian’s eyes.

“Good, then let me see what talent the Southern Region’s top prodigies have!” Luo Tian’s eyes bore battle spirit. If it weren’t for the Heavenly Corpse Sect, he might have accepted Jin Wulong’s challenge long ago. After all, he never feared any prodigy.

Behind him, seven-colored light flashed, and Luo Tian appeared before Jin Wulong. His Rupture Spear was steady in his hand, its overwhelming aura rising.

“Good spear!” Jin Wulong’s face bore excitement as his hand flashed, and a black long sword appeared in his grasp.

“Hm?” Seeing the sword, Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly. This sword felt familiar, reminding him of Dong Sansi’s Ink Sword. Yet this one was far more terrifying than Dong Sansi’s.

“Begin!” Jin Wulong laughed, and his figure seemed to vanish into the world, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Legend says Jin Wulong possesses both dark and light attributes, with his body containing dragon blood. He’s quite troublesome,” Luo Tian mused, but his spiritual sense immediately spread to locate Jin Wulong.
