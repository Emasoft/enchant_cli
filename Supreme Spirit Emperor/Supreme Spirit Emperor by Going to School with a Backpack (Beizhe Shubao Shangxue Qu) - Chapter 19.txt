“Let me just practice for fifteen days and see if this Soul and Spirit Cultivation Technique can give me some surprises!” Luo Tian said, sitting cross-legged on the edge of his bed with his eyes closed.

As soon as Luo Tian’s eyes shut, he turned his inner vision toward his vast golden mind sea. He gazed upon the Epoch Book suspended high above it and began to circulate the Soul and Spirit Cultivation Technique.

“Crash…” As Luo Tian initiated the technique, his mind sea erupted into a colossal wave, like a tsunami. The force sent a ringing in Luo Tian’s ears.

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, his face flushed with redness. He hadn’t expected the technique to react so violently. This was a minor setback, but for Luo Tian, who had long since accustomed himself to pain, it posed no real problem.

Soon, Luo Tian managed to stabilize the raging mind sea, and it began to function in an orderly manner under the technique’s influence.

…

Half a month later.

At night, Luo Tian opened his eyes. Two streaks of light like meteors flashed from his gaze. If someone could see his eyes at that moment, they would be entranced.

“Half a month… I’ve finally reached the middle stage of spiritual awareness!” Luo Tian murmured.

Then, he returned to his mind sea again—not to train but to concentrate all his spiritual awareness toward the Epoch Book, launching a full-force assault.

Indeed, Luo Tian had aimed to reach the middle stage of spiritual awareness so he could test whether he could open the Epoch Book again. Every time he broke through a stage, he attempted to unlock it, but had never succeeded. He had always been eager to know what the Epoch Book would reveal upon its next opening, but it remained sealed.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian’s overwhelming spiritual awareness repeatedly struck the Epoch Book, which seemed like a fragile boat on the ocean. No matter how he urged it, it refused to yield.

“I won’t be defeated by this!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and channeled the Soul and Spirit Cultivation Technique again,凝聚 his spiritual awareness.

“Buzz…” Under Luo Tian’s desperate effort, the Epoch Book finally reacted. With eager eyes, he watched it glow with golden light and slowly open after half a year of silence.

The familiar space enveloped him. He looked around and realized he was in a special realm. A smile spread across his face—this was the place where he had first learned the Emperor’s Seal. At that time, it was said there were five seals, but he had only seen one.

A shadowy figure appeared. Luo Tian recognized it immediately—it was the one who would teach him the second seal.

Luo Tian dared not be careless, knowing the complexity of the technique and fearing even a single mistake. Under his careful gaze, the shadow’s hands began to move with practiced precision.

Yet something puzzled Luo Tian: this time, the shadow’s hands moved without any trace of spiritual energy. Instead, a faintly familiar vibration resonated. Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed as he whispered, “Spiritual awareness!”

The practiced movements culminated in a spiritual awareness seal forming within Luo Tian’s mind. It was invisible to the naked eye.

“Spiritual Awareness Martial Art!” Luo Tian murmured, marveling at the second seal’s power. He hadn’t expected it to be a spiritual awareness technique.

As Luo Tian marveled, the shadow had already condensed the spiritual seal into a terrifying intensity. With a fierce push of his hands, the massive seal hurtled toward the mountain opposite him at terrifying speed.

A thunderous sound of breaking air echoed around it, followed by a deafening explosion. Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he watched the mountain crumble into fragments. He resolved to master this devastating technique.

After the shadow completed the technique, three words—“Soul-Stealing Seal”—etched themselves into Luo Tian’s mind. The hand gestures for the Soul-Stealing Seal were imprinted in his consciousness.

Luo Tian emerged from the special realm, his face alight with excitement. He clenched his fists: “There are still fifteen days left—I must master this Soul-Stealing Seal. Once I do, it will become another of my deadliest techniques!”

“However, going to Feiyun Sect alone isn’t enough. I’ll need others’ help; otherwise, something might go wrong!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination.

As soon as Luo Tian made his decision, a young voice echoed from within his courtyard: “I am Luo Tian. In half a month, I will go to Feiyun Sect for revenge. May those who have any connection with me lend a hand! Naturally, those who assist will be rewarded handsomely!”

Chapter 87: Luo Tian’s Network ()

As Luo Tian’s words faded, the Five Elements Sect fell into a brief silence.

“This kid’s spiritual awareness has definitely advanced significantly,” Lu Kunpeng sat in the main hall of the Alchemy Sect, a look of satisfaction on his face.

Other elders of the Alchemy Sect also wore expressions of disbelief. To project one’s voice across the entire Five Elements Sect, one must reach the Bone-Refining Stage. Yet Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness was clear and resonant, not resembling the initial stage of Bone-Refining at all. Some newly appointed elders had only reached the early Bone-Refining Stage, while Luo Tian—a mere Body-Tempering cultivator—had achieved this. How could they not be astonished?

Lin Zhengyang wore a look of admiration; Luo Tian’s progress had thoroughly impressed him.

“Luo Tian, the Alchemy Sect’s pride and future pillar! We must help!” Many alchemists murmured, preparing to assist Luo Tian by leveraging their connections.

“Haha! Finally returning home, I miss it already!” Gu Lei stood before an ancient alchemy furnace, his face lit with joy upon hearing Luo Tian’s voice. He didn’t notice Wu Taiping standing nearby for a long time.

“You little bastard, you’re sneaking to refine pills again! Hmph… what are you refining? I can smell the scent of poison!” Wu Taiping sniffed, about to scold Gu Lei but paused, his face puzzled as he took the pill Gu Lei had crafted.

On Greenwood Peak, Gu Qianxue sat cross-legged among the trees, her face expressionless: “Hmph. Feiyun Sect, prepare for the price of your decision.”

“Ah! My man’s cultivation has definitely improved again. He even plans to avenge himself. For Qianxue’s sake, I’ll help too!” Ning Qingzhu’s teasing voice echoed from afar.

“Hmph, it’s only because Ji Chen’s senior will definitely go. Why do you always drag me into this, Senior Sister?” Gu Qianxue pouted.

“Ah! You little brat, learning to argue with your senior? Let me teach you a lesson!” Ning Qingzhu’s words trailed as she approached Gu Qianxue, her hand reaching toward Gu Qianxue’s armpit to tickle her.

Gu Qianxue couldn’t withstand it and retaliated, sending silver laughter echoing through the forest.

“Though my cultivation isn’t high, I still have to go!” Duan Sansi sat in the Herb Hall, his face resolute.

“Luo Tian’s character is admirable; I must help!” On Greenwood Peak, Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong radiated the aura of Body-Tempering Ninth Stage.

Meanwhile, Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun had unknowingly clashed. Upon hearing Luo Tian’s voice, they both halted their movements, seeing a flicker of battle intent in each other’s eyes.

“Will you go?” Feng Qianyu wiped sweat from his forehead, asking Zhang Hongyun in a low voice.

“Of course I’ll go! I want to see which genius could push Luo Tian this far!” Zhang Hongyun panted, laughing.

On Thick Earth Peak, Yang Huanyu had also heard Luo Tian’s words. His eyes flickered with contemplation before returning to calmness. He bit his finger, a drop of blood flying from it. His hands moved swiftly, and gray mist coalesced into the blood, dyeing it gray. Yang Huanyu prodded his finger, and the blood vanished into thin air.

“Luo Dan Shi’s reward will definitely be generous; this trade is worth it!” Others murmured, and some Body-Tempering disciples had already begun preparing to depart for Feiyun Sect. After all, the speed of Body-Tempering and Bone-Refining was incomparable.

“Little Brother, how could I not be present when you go to avenge?” Lei Yong and Ji Chen strode toward Luo Tian’s courtyard.

At the cave where Luo Tian had once secluded with Zhang Ziping, Zhang Ziping sat cross-legged, eyes opening: “Go. I’ll break free before your departure!”

After saying this, Zhang Ziping had an unknown jade bottle in his hand. He tossed it out of the cave mouth, and it shot toward Luo Tian’s courtyard at terrifying speed.

At that moment, Lei Yong and Ji Chen arrived at the entrance of Luo Tian’s courtyard. Hearing a whistling sound, Lei Yong leaped into the air and caught the bottle in his hands.

Lei Yong opened it, sniffing lightly. Though he didn’t refine pills himself, as an Alchemy Sect member, he was familiar with them. After sniffing, his face changed: “Clear Mind Body-Tempering Pill!”

Ji Chen, hearing this, wore an expression of surprise. They exchanged a glance.

“Little Brother really needs this pill now. Senior Brother is definitely biased; why didn’t I get such treatment?” Lei Yong pouted.

Before Lei Yong could complain further, Ji Chen stepped into Luo Tian’s courtyard first.

Lei Yong saw Ji Chen ignoring him and let out a scoff, but when the two entered Luo Tian’s courtyard, both felt a faint sense of danger. Though weak, it was real.

They exchanged glances and saw Luo Tian sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed. Suddenly, he opened them, emitting a profound gaze that sent even the Bone-Refining Mid-stage Lei Yong into a brief daze.

Their expressions showed disbelief; Luo Tian was merely a Body-Tempering cultivator, yet he had caused them to feel danger. Their estimation of him rose another level.

Under their astonished gazes, Luo Tian’s hands moved with precision. Though slow, Lei Yong felt a terrifying fluctuation from his hands. If he was careless, he might be injured!

“Senior Brother, help me test the power of my martial art!” Luo Tian saw Gu Lei and Ji Chen arrive and lit up, shouting at them.

“Haha! You little brat, you’ve grown bold enough to challenge your senior! Come on, let us two seniors see what talent you’ve gained!” Gu Lei laughed, his body crackling with lightning.

But when Lei Yong turned around, he found Ji Chen had already moved aside, arms crossed as he watched the spectacle.

“Ugh! What do you mean? Ah, I swear! Little brat, you’re ambushing me!” Lei Yong was about to scold Ji Chen for being unfair but felt a terrifying fluctuation instantly before him.

Lei Yong had no time to react and raised his arm in defense.

“Crash!” A thunderous sound echoed, like a lightning bolt splitting the sky. Lei Yong’s body crackled with lightning and he was pushed back repeatedly.

“What in the world is this thing!” Lei Yong shook his numb arm, his upper clothing no longer intact, revealing his lean physique. Green lightning aura dispersed around him.

Ji Chen was also surprised, watching Luo Tian expectantly.

“This martial art is called the Soul-Stealing Seal!” Luo Tian panted, a smile on his face—clearly satisfied with the power of the Soul-Stealing Seal.

Chapter 88: Breaking Through Body-Tempering Ninth Stage ()

Chapter 88: Breaking Through Body-Tempering Ninth Stage

“Soul-Stealing Seal! Is this a spiritual awareness martial art?” Lei Yong asked, puzzled.

“Indeed, it is! Though I’ve never seen such a powerful spiritual awareness martial art before. Compared to your little brother’s Five Elements Rebirth Emperor’s Seal, it is slightly stronger. More importantly, spiritual awareness martial arts are harder to detect if one isn’t careful—this is their terrifying nature!” Ji Chen, usually cold as ice, smiled slightly at Lei Yong’s defeat and explained.

“Senior Brother, your cultivation is truly remarkable! Even my ultimate technique couldn’t harm you at all. I admire you!” Luo Tian, seeing Lei Yong’s unfriendly gaze, quickly flattered him.

“You! You little brat! Ten meals at Yan Yue Building, and I’ll overlook it!” Lei Yong rubbed his numb arm.

“Uh…” Luo Tian hadn’t expected such a condition, but recalling the expensive price of Yan Yue Building, he quickly haggled.

“Three meals!”

“Nine meals! No less than one, or I’ll give you none. If you insist, just beat me up!”

Ji Chen watched the two haggling and wore a faint smile, surprising Luo Tian.

After much debate, they finally agreed on six meals.

“Little brat, do you feel your cultivation has been progressing slowly lately?” After their discussion, Lei Yong straightened his face and asked Luo Tian.

Hearing this, Luo Tian’s expression darkened—Lei Yong had hit the mark. He didn’t know why, but he felt as if he could break through Body-Tempering Ninth Stage at any moment. Yet, whenever he tried to grasp that feeling, it vanished mysteriously. Even his alchemy failures had increased recently, often ruining pills.

“Yes, Senior Brother knows why?” Luo Tian asked solemnly.

“Ah! Your current spiritual energy strength is more than enough to enter Body-Tempering Ninth Stage. Do you know why you can’t?” Lei Yong’s face showed anger, his voice growing louder.

Luo Tian was confused, unsure what he had done wrong. He asked: “Please explain, Senior Brother!”

“You’re not calm!” Lei Yong’s voice was solemn and thunderous.

“You’re not calm! You’re not calm!” The words echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, and he wore a contemplative expression.

“Though you appear calm, you still regard Li Xiuping as an opponent. And your tension is evident—why? We don’t know!” Lei Yong said calmly.

“Remember, you are our Alchemy Sect disciple and our little brother. No matter what happens, your seniors will bear the burden for you. Don’t overthink it—just go ahead and do it! I can say no more; the rest is up to you!” Lei Yong ignored Luo Tian’s contemplation and took out a Clear Mind Body-Tempering Pill, placing it before Luo Tian. Then he and Ji Chen left the courtyard.

“Not calm… what makes me not calm? Is it because I don’t want to see Chen Yunting? Or am I afraid of losing to Li Xiuping?” Luo Tian murmured, holding the Clear Mind Body-Tempering Pill.

Looking at the pill, a warm feeling flowed through Luo Tian’s heart. Remembering his senior’s words, he wore his usual calm expression.

“Can’t辜负 the seniors’ expectations!” Luo Tian disregarded everything and sat cross-legged, swallowing the Clear Mind Body-Tempering Pill.

The pill dissolved instantly without any spiritual energy explosion or pain. Luo Tian felt an unprecedented calmness, as if in the warm embrace of a dreamy night.

At the same time Luo Tian sat in his courtyard, disciples from various peaks who had decided to help Luo Tian began their journey toward Feiyun Sect. Those at the Bone-Refining Stage moved leisurely, continuing their usual routines—after all, Luo Tian hadn’t departed yet. They had no need to leave so early; Feiyun Sect was just a place to visit for Luo Tian’s sake.

…

At the same time Luo Tian broke through Body-Tempering Ninth Stage, thousands of miles away from Five Elements Sect, on Feiyun Mountain.

“Li! You won’t live long! Give back my disciple’s life! Even if I die, as a ghost I won’t let you go!” A wretched voice echoed from Feiyun Sect’s dungeon, a disheveled old woman screaming.

“Ah… Master Lan, why do you suffer so? If you admit your mistake, with your Bone-Refining Stage strength, you’ll surely be reappointed as a sect elder. It’s much better than being locked in this cell!” A young disciple sighed, advising her.

“Hmph! Do you think I’d risk my life to block Five Elements Sect’s anger? Don’t pretend you don’t know what they’ve done!” The old woman hissed, her eyes glowing crimson.

“Hmph! Old hag, you’re too stubborn!” Another disciple saw his companion’s advice was futile and turned fierce. He had a whip with fire spiritual energy in his hand.

“Old hag, taste this whip’s power!” The disciple said and whipped the old woman.

At that moment, on Feiyun Mountain’s peak, Li Xiuping stood in white robes, his face expressionless. His eyes were half-closed as he murmured: “I wonder if you’ll go mad when you learn the truth. I think you will!”

Behind Li Xiuping stood a shadowy figure, watching his expression and demeanor. A complex emotion flickered in his eyes: “According to the report, some Body-Tempering disciples from Five Elements Sect have already left. They should arrive at Feiyun’s mountain foot within ten days.”

“Fast enough? But merely Body-Tempering Stage, I haven’t taken them seriously. I hope you won’t disappoint me!” Li Xiuping smiled oddly.

“Do you think it’s wise to cooperate with such a person?” The shadow saw Li Xiuping’s odd smile and felt cold. Even he, who prided himself on being emotionless, felt a shiver at Li Xiuping’s smile.

…

Time passed quickly; seven days had gone by. Luo Tian sat cross-legged in his courtyard, his face calm and untroubled, like a tranquil lake.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes. The surrounding spiritual energy, once calm, surged like a tsunami.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with lightning. His Five Elements Spiritual Energy Technique surged, absorbing the wild spiritual energy around him.

As the spiritual energy entered his body, sweat gradually dripped from his forehead. But Luo Tian seemed unaware, his body emitting a series of cracks. His lips curled: “Body-Tempering Ninth Stage—today, I break through!”

Chapter 89: Re-entering Xuantian City ()

Chapter 89: Re-entering Xuantian City

As Luo Tian entered Body-Tempering Ninth Stage, the spiritual energy in his courtyard was instantly absorbed. Two towering ancient trees in the yard swayed slowly.

Luo Tian clenched his fists, a sense of superiority swelling within him. He roared upward, spiritual energy gathering in his fist and smashing the ground.

“Crash!” The courtyard shook as if an earthquake had struck, swaying three times.

“Little brat, are you going mad?” A thunderous voice echoed from afar. Lei Yong and Ji Chen arrived like lightning in Luo Tian’s courtyard.

Seeing them, Luo Tian wore a grateful expression. If it weren’t for Lei Yong’s reminder, he would have taken much longer to break through Body-Tempering Ninth Stage.

“Little brat, many people have already set out for Feiyun Sect these days. Hmph, your influence is truly unmatched!” Lei Yong teased.

Thinking of the decreasing number of disciples from various peaks, Lei Yong sighed. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have such terrifying influence after only half a year in Five Elements Sect.

In recent days, people had gradually left Five Elements Sect. Disciples from various peaks were fewer, especially in the Alchemy Sect—nearly half had departed. Though Lu Kunpeng helped a lot, it was also due to Luo Tian’s reputation. Disciples from other peaks at Body-Tempering Ninth Stage had also decreased by two-thirds. The Alchemy Sect’s influence was evident.

Hearing Lei Yong’s words, Luo Tian felt surprised. He hadn’t expected to have such a reputation. But then he thought about the reward issue, and his body trembled slightly.

Seeming to sense Luo Tian’s thoughts, Lei Yong chuckled: “Little Brother, I guess you’ll have to refine pills until you vomit this time!”

Seeing Lei Yong’s gloating, Luo Tian smiled bitterly, unsure what to do.

“Ah… well, after this is done, I’ll refine pills for a year. After all, refining pills also helps spiritual awareness grow!” Luo Tian sighed.

“By the way, little brother, let’s settle that debt of meals at Yan Yue Building first. Let me satisfy my hunger!” Lei Yong rubbed his hands, changing the subject.

Hearing this, Luo Tian slapped his head—had he forgotten that? He thought it had been a long time since he saw Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue. He nodded: “Let’s call Gu Lei and Qianxue too! After we eat, it’s time to depart!”

After informing Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, Luo Tian changed clothes. The group had a big meal at Yan Yue Building before returning to his small courtyard.

…

A night passed quickly. The next morning, several young figures appeared on the path leading out of Five Elements Sect—Luo Tian and his group, though with an added Ning Qingzhu.

“Ah… Luo Tian, this time I’m helping you! How will you repay me?” Ning Qingzhu chattered all the way, following Ji Chen.

“Haha! What should I do to repay you, Senior Sister? Should I tie Ji Chen Senior Brother up and throw him into your room?” Luo Tian, now familiar with Ning Qingzhu, occasionally teased her.

Luo Tian’s words had just been said when the group laughed lightly.

Though they were chatting and laughing, their speed was astonishing. Half a day later, the group had already reached the gate of a towering city.

“Xuantian City!” Gu Lei saw the three big characters on the city gate and wore a sinister smile.

Gu Qianxue and Luo Tian saw Xuantian City, their eyes flashing with cold light.

“What? Do you have some connection with this Xuantian City?” Ning Qingzhu asked, puzzled. Lei Yong and Ji Chen also wore confused expressions.

“Connection? A big one!” Gu Lei sneered, recounting their past experiences in Xuantian City.

Hearing Gu Lei’s story, Lei Yong and the others grew more serious, their eyes coldly staring at Xuantian City’s gate.

“Let’s go in. I want to see what the city lord is doing here, knowing I’m from Five Elements Sect. Why dare he stay so boldly?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness, and he strode toward the gate.

“Stop! What is your name!” A guard saw Luo Tian and his group—youths—and thought they were disciples of a certain family. Especially when he saw Gu Qianxue and Ning Qingzhu, his eyes glowed with lust.

Ning Qingzhu and Gu Qianxue frowned, feeling the guard’s leering gaze.

“I am Luo Tian. These are my friends. We’re from Tianyuan City, passing through Xuantian City to find an old friend!” Luo Tian watched the Body-Tempering Third Stage guard with a playful smile. To them, this guard was no different from an ordinary person.

Hearing “Tianyuan City,” the guard wore a cautious expression, but when his eyes fell on the two women, he felt stirred. He shouted at Luo Tian: “From Tianyuan City? Sorry, according to the rules, outsiders must be searched!”

After saying this, he signaled his companions. The other guards understood their leader’s intent and approached Luo Tian and the others, while the guard leader walked toward Ning Qingzhu and Gu Qianxue.

People waiting to enter the city sighed, thinking Luo Tian’s luck was bad.

Luo Tian saw the guards approaching without asking anything and wore a smile, making no move but gazing pitifully at the guard leader.

Ning Qingzhu, though usually bold, wasn’t a pushover. Seeing the guard leader approaching her and his disgusting hand reaching for her, she said coldly: “Get lost…”

A sharp sound echoed from Ning Qingzhu’s voice. Her spiritual awareness was at Bone-Refining First Stage, while the guard leader was only Body-Tempering Third Stage. The gap between them was immense. He couldn’t withstand it. As soon as Ning Qingzhu said “Get lost,” the guard leader was sent flying backward, hitting the city wall.

“Sss…” A gasp echoed from the crowd. Seeing Ning Qingzhu, who was no more than twenty years old, say “Get lost” and send the guard leader injured, people were stunned. They couldn’t believe what this young woman’s cultivation was.

“You! You dare to cause trouble in Xuantian City! You must be desperate for death!” Ning Qingzhu had only punished the guard leader and hadn’t killed him. Now, the guard leader stood up with his subordinates’ help and shouted.

Hearing this, Luo Tian wore a playful smile. He took out a pill from his storage ring and placed it in his mouth, then spoke with a hoarse voice: “Zhang Xuantian, come out and meet me!”

Chapter 90: Zhang Qǐ Arrives ()

Chapter 90: Zhang Qǐ Arrives

“Zhang Xuantian, come out and meet me!” The hoarse voice echoed through the entire Xuantian City via spiritual awareness.

“Who are these youths? How dare they shout Zhang Xuantian’s name so boldly? They look no more than twenty. How could they have such formidable cultivation!” People murmured, not questioning why Luo Tian’s voice had changed.

The guard leader who had been injured by Ning Qingzhu felt his face change upon hearing Luo Tian’s boldness. He knew he had met a tough opponent. Whether these youths were friends or foes of Zhang Xuantian, his fate today wouldn’t be good.

In the city lord’s mansion, Zhang Xuantian stood respectfully with two black-cloaked figures. If Luo Tian were here, he would recognize these two as the same mysterious black-cloaked figures from the restaurant who had a moon emblem on their collars.

Hearing the hoarse voice, Zhang Xuantian’s gaze sharpened. He felt a strange familiarity with the voice and began to recall where he had heard it before.

In an instant, Zhang Xuantian’s body trembled. He bowed to the two figures: “Two elders, I have urgent matters to attend to. I’ll return after dealing with them!”

“Go ahead, but don’t mention us to anyone!” One of the black-cloaked figures spoke coldly.

“Of course, your presence in Xuantian City is already a great honor for me. I would never dare to reveal your presence!” Zhang Xuantian bowed again and vanished before the two figures.

Zhang Xuantian walked into his courtyard, excited. He hadn’t expected the elder from the auction to return to Xuantian City again. He whispered: “Uncle Dai, come with me to meet this elder!”

Seeing Zhang Xuantian’s distant figure, one of the black-cloaked figures muttered: “This Zhang Xuantian is cunning like a fox. I wonder if he can be used for our purposes.”

“An insignificant city lord! Don’t take him seriously. If we didn’t want to draw attention, we would have killed him long ago. Granting him life is already a great mercy!” The other black-cloaked figure spoke coldly.

“Still, the voice’s owner must be no ordinary person! I’m worried this small Xuantian City might change!” The two figures spoke alternately.

At that moment, Luo Tian and his group stood at Xuantian City’s gate under the curious glances of onlookers.

The guard leader, no longer arrogant, dared not leave despite his injuries. He stood respectfully, barely daring to breathe.

Not long after, a young figure appeared with a group of Body-Tempering Fourth Stage guards.

Seeing this figure, Luo Tian smiled. Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei also wore smiles. Gu Lei chuckled: “I didn’t expect Zhang Xuantian to come, but this kid did. Good thing he ran fast in Five Elements Sect; now he’s coming to his doom!”

Zhang Qǐ walked out with a light-hearted expression. Half a year had passed, but his personality hadn’t changed—he was still arrogant. Before he could finish speaking, he shouted: “Who dared to cause trouble in my Xuantian City? You guards are useless! I have to handle it myself!”

“Ah… Zhang Qǐ, your temper has grown even worse in half a year!” Gu Lei shouted back.

“Who cares about your temper…?” Zhang Qǐ’s words were cut off as he saw Luo Tian and his group. He turned and ran, having advanced from Body-Tempering Third Stage to Fourth Stage in half a year. His fear made him move swiftly.

“Want to run?” Gu Lei saw Zhang Qǐ fleeing and smiled, his Body-Tempering Seventh Stage power bursting out. His body moved like the wind and reached Zhang Qǐ in an instant, kicking his legs.

“Crack…” The sound of bones breaking echoed clearly. Due to inertia, Zhang Qǐ howled and flew far away.

Before Zhang Qǐ could get up, Gu Lei’s figure was already there again. He grabbed Zhang Qǐ like a chicken and returned slowly. The whole process took only several breaths.

The onlookers hadn’t yet understood what had happened when they saw the city’s young lord thrown to the ground like a dead dog.

Zhang Qǐ looked at Luo Tian and his group, fear in his eyes. He stammered, unable to speak. When he had seen Zhang Daoyi’s death in Five Elements Sect, he knew without Zhang Daoyi, he was nothing. So he had decided to flee back to Xuantian City and informed Zhang Xuantian of Luo Tian’s group.

He had expected his father to take him out of Xuantian City, but instead, his father only cried in grief and fainted. When he awoke, his father hadn’t fled but told him to stay in Xuantian City.

Hearing this, Zhang Qǐ, who had blindly trusted his father before, now felt confident. He became even more reckless than before, causing chaos in Xuantian City.

Today, Zhang Qǐ had been in a good mood, drinking with his henchmen at the restaurant. But halfway through, he heard Luo Tian’s voice. He wanted to show off before his father and thus led the guards toward the city gate, never expecting to meet someone he had never wanted to face.

“Little brat, how do you feel seeing your grandfather?” Gu Lei patted Zhang Qǐ’s face, teasingly.

Zhang Qǐ looked at the group and was stunned when he saw Gu Qianxue and Ning Qingzhu. He stood motionless for a moment.

“I went… little brat, you’re really…” Gu Lei saw Zhang Qǐ staring at the two women and was speechless. He raised his hand and slapped Zhang Qǐ’s face hard.

A clear slap echoed, and Gu Lei’s strength was immense. Zhang Qǐ’s face swelled immediately, his teeth falling out.

“Luo Tian, you’d better let me go, or my father won’t forgive you!” Zhang Qǐ’s face showed fear. His teeth were mostly missing, making his speech unclear.

“Oh? Then I’ll see how your deadbeat father can’t forgive me today!” Luo Tian smiled, his voice hoarse from the pill that changed it.

“Your voice!” Zhang Qǐ asked, puzzled.

“My voice! He’ll surely recognize it!” Luo Tian spoke calmly, gazing toward Xuantian City.

“Unknown elder’s presence! I’m sorry for my negligence!” As Luo Tian and Zhang Qǐ spoke, Zhang Xuantian’s respectful voice echoed from Xuantian City.

Chapter 91: Battle Against Zhang Xuantian ()

Chapter 91: Battle Against Zhang Xuantian

Hearing Zhang Xuantian’s voice, the crowd looked at Zhang Qǐ, who was being beaten. Their faces wore strange expressions.

Even Lei Yong and the others looked puzzled, unsure why Zhang Xuantian was so polite. Only Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei wore smiles.

At that moment, Zhang Xuantian was outside the crowd but hadn’t seen Luo Tian and his group. He guessed it must be a guard who had offended the elder from the auction.

Luo Tian also wore a smile, waiting for Zhang Xuantian to approach from afar.

Pushing through the crowd, Zhang Xuantian moved among them, feeling strange at the gazes of those around him.

When he entered, he saw the sight that made him furious—his son being beaten. He understood why people’s gazes were strange. If your son was beaten and you still treated the opponent respectfully, it would be strange.

Seeing Zhang Qǐ’s face covered in blood, Zhang Xuantian’s face darkened instantly. He looked at the youths but couldn’t sense their spiritual energy fluctuations. However, his years of experience told him these youths were likely strong.

“You! You’re not dead!” Before Zhang Xuantian could speak, his companion Dai Lao exclaimed in surprise. His eyes stared at Gu Lei with shock.

The old man named Dai never expected that Gu Lei, who had been poisoned by his seven-turn absorption poison, could still be alive. At that time, with their conditions, it was impossible to remove the poison.
