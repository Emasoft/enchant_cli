In his line of sight, above Luo Tian's head hovered a verdant spiritual herb, swaying gently. Black and white qi, resembling the forces of life and death, radiated from its emerald body.

A single white petal, resembling a ghostly face, bloomed upon the verdant branch, occasionally emitting human-like laughter and cries.

"Indeed, the sounds we heard—laughter and crying—came from this very herb!" several sects murmured.

"Give it to me!" Luo Tian bellowed, extending his hand again toward the herb.

"That is the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower, an immortal herb! It accompanied the Immortal Lord of Gods and Demons!" a senior remarked, his voice trembling with excitement as he gazed at the herb nearly in Luo Tian's grasp.

"Stop!"

"Immortal herbs are beyond your reach!" As Luo Tian neared the herb's root, several sects erupted into frenzied chaos.

An immortal herb—only a world-epoch master could cultivate one, extending life for another epoch. Such a treasure could drive anyone mad.

At that moment, the sect members had turned bloodshot-eyed, their hands flashing with radiant energy as they unleashed their ultimate weapons: five pseudo-era treasures aimed at Luo Tian.

Thunderous explosions erupted; the sects cared not for this ancient cave of gods and demons—gain the immortal herb, and risk was worth it.

Five pseudo-era treasures, wielded by ten people simultaneously, would crush Luo Tian without a chance of survival.

"Damn!" Luo Tian felt the immense pressure behind him, his face darkening with frustration as he gazed at the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower mere丈 away. Yet, there was no choice—facing mad sects, he could only retreat.

Yao Ming Ghost Step activated, Luo Tian narrowly evaded the five attacks, appearing in a corner of the cave.

Though he dodged the assault, the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower remained above them, radiating black and white qi.

"Buzz..." Suddenly, the herb's black and white qi surged violently, forming a Taijitu diagram that shielded its fragile form.

"Boom..." Thunderous roars echoed as five legendary pseudo-era treasures struck the Taijitu, producing a deafening sound that shook the cave. The wild energy battered Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan.

Bell sounds echoed; Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan stood beneath the world-epoch bell, their faces awestruck as they gazed at the seemingly fragile herb still radiating immense vitality.

All were stunned by this scene—five pseudo-era treasures, a force even a sage at the peak would avoid, yet they had been repelled by this unassuming flower.

"Powerful! Immortal herbs truly are immortal—five pseudo-era treasures could not harm it!" the sects murmured, their hearts trembling but eyes burning with greed.

"Capture it!" they roared, charging toward the herb.

Petals swayed; the flower, resembling a human face, transformed into anger, black and white qi spilling forth to form a dragon that lunged at the sects.

"Roar!" Though the black and white dragon seemed ordinary, it sent a shiver through the sects, halting their advance.

"Defend!" The sects halted, recalling their pseudo-era treasures to block the herb's attack.

Another explosion erupted as the black and white dragon collided with the sects' treasures, instantly enveloping them in a whirlwind that obscured Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's view.

Then, the herb seemed to recognize Jiang Nanxuan as its culprit, white petals radiating powerful suction. A vortex of black and white energy engulfed Jiang Nanxuan within the world-epoch bell.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's eyes widened; Luo Tian grabbed Jiang Nanxuan, who was being pulled toward the vortex.

"This is no ordinary herb! Such power would make even a sage at the peak retreat!" Luo Tian trembled internally, regretting underestimating an immortal herb.

Jiang Nanxuan's face darkened as he struggled against the suction, unable to resist. He was about to be devoured by the vortex.

Even the dimmest mind knew being sucked in would bring no good.

"World-epoch Seal!" Luo Tian had no other choice but to reveal the World-epoch Seal, desperate to save them.

Yet soon, despair gripped him—some unseen force seemed to suppress the World-epoch Seal, rendering it unusable.

"Done!" Luo Tian sighed internally; due to holding Jiang Nanxuan, he too was about to fall into the vortex.

Luo Tian knew if he let go, he'd escape the suction—but he couldn't abandon Jiang Nanxuan.

"Lo Tian, let go! Tell Meng Yao I'm sorry!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled bitterly, addressing Luo Tian.

"No, tell her yourself!" Luo Tian roared, his mind's ocean of gold waves crashing against the world-epoch book. He hoped this last hope would save them.

But again, disappointment—world-epoch book remained indifferent, floating silently in his mind.

Jiang Nanxuan's face showed resolve; a blue sword materialized, cutting through his robe.

"Stop!" Luo Tian bellowed, eyes turning blood-red, madness in his gaze as he stared at Jiang Nanxuan.

His robe torn, Luo Tian clutched Jiang Nanxuan's white sleeve, feeling as if his soul was drained.

Without Luo Tian's burden, Jiang Nanxuan vanished into the black and white vortex in an instant.

"Ahh!" Luo Tian's eyes turned crimson, his breath ragged as he lunged at the herb with the Dao-Defying Fist.

Though his attack was fierce, it was no match for the herb's power; a black and white diagram formed, effortlessly deflecting his punch.

"Buzz..." The herb's human-like petals smiled triumphantly, transforming into a streak of light that flew toward the cave's depths.

"Come back!" Luo Tian roared, activating Yao Ming Ghost Step to chase it.

As Luo Tian took off, a silver light shot from the herb's direction, piercing his chest before he could react.

Chapter 1067: The Outbreak ()

Within the cave of gods and demons, Luo Tian's long hair flew as he radiated wild energy, reckless and fearless. He ignored it being one of the nine deadly realms—his mind was set on chasing the herb.

Jiang Nanxuan, a man of utmost calm, memories of their past surfaced in Luo Tian's mind. Jiang Nanxuan had always aided him; though they rarely spoke, to Luo Tian, he was a brother. Like Gu Lei and Zheng Xin, they were life-and-death brothers. Luo Tian even admired Jiang Nanxuan's composure—his mindset was beyond even Luo Tian's cultivated peace.

If not for his quest to find the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower, Jiang Nanxuan wouldn't have faced such danger. Guilt and Jiang Nanxuan's misfortune drove Luo Tian to madness, his body transforming into a streak of light as he flew into the cave.

But just as Luo Tian took off, a silver light shot from the cave's depths. The coldness of it made Luo Tian's mouth go numb, his frenzied heart slightly calming.

"I'm fine!" A light-hearted thought echoed in Luo Tian's mind as the cold energy pierced his chest.

Hearing this, Luo Tian's heart shook; his crimson eyes gradually calmed as the voice came from Jiang Nanxuan, who had been devoured by the herb.

"Buzz..." The silver light shimmered, radiating immense vitality that made Luo Tian feel at ease. He waved his hand, retrieving the silver light embedded in his chest. His eyes then radiated waves of energy.

"The petal of the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower!" Luo Tian gazed at the vibrant, life-giving petal in his hand, eyes filled with emotion.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, sealing the petal into a jade vial.

As he sealed it, the sound of breaking air echoed behind him—several sect elders and disciples who had been trapped by the herb.

Luo Tian's act of sealing the petal was witnessed, their faces revealing greed as they activated their pseudo-era treasures to trap him.

"Give us the petal!" A senior from a sect barked, his voice wild with madness.

Others gazed at Luo Tian hungrily; they had felt the herb's power and knew even a world-epoch master would struggle to claim it.

Though Luo Tian had only one petal, it was still an immortal herb—vastly superior to ordinary sage herbs. Its value was immeasurable.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, scanning the group. Their greed was evident; they had been blinded by treasure. If he didn't hand over the petal, they'd attack.

Hand it over? Impossible—this was the main ingredient for the Reincarnation Pill, and Jiang Nanxuan had sacrificed his life to obtain it. Luo Tian wouldn't hand it over, and he disliked these people anyway. Their attack on him to prevent obtaining the herb was unforgivable.

"What if I don't?" Luo Tian surveyed the group, not even drawing his spear, knowing it was no match for pseudo-era treasures.

"Kid, we've been tolerating you long enough! Outside this cave, you were arrogant, killing several sects' disciples. If we don't kill you, it's unthinkable. Today, even if we die, we'll kill you—otherwise, our sects' honor would be lost!" a sect elder growled.

Others glared at Luo Tian, especially those who had lost disciples. Their hatred was clear; killing Luo Tian would lessen their punishment upon returning.

"Useless rabble! Since you want to take the lead, I'll start with you!" Luo Tian countered fiercely, dashing toward the senior.

"Everyone, unite! Don't give him a chance to resist—activate your pseudo-era treasures and crush him!" the如意宗 elder commanded, slapping a mirror that erupted with golden light toward Luo Tian.

Others waved their hands, combining their pseudo-era treasures to crush Luo Tian with overwhelming power.

Thunderous explosions echoed again in the cave, wild pressure instantly attacking Luo Tian.

Five pseudo-era treasures, combined with ten people's power—enough to harm even a sage at the peak. If Luo Tian was hit, he'd die for sure.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed; he drew his Shangtian Bow, black demonic energy凝聚 into an arrow that shot toward the five pseudo-era treasures.

"You're only one, Shangtian Bow—how dare you block us? It's a dream!" they sneered.

"Blocking is impossible, but delaying is possible!" Luo Tian's feet radiated black energy as he activated Yao Ming Ghost Step, rushing toward them.

"Crack..." Black lightning surged in the golden cave as black demonic arrows clashed with five pseudo-era treasures, producing a powerful shock.

Though the black arrow was strong enough to kill a sage at the end, it was no match for five pseudo-era treasures. Within one breath, it dissolved into demonic energy, scattered by the treasures.

This brief delay gave Luo Tian a chance to escape the five treasures' final strike.

Luo Tian appeared before the senior who had mocked him, his fist wrapped in demonic energy, charging toward him.

The elder's face turned pale; he had seen the power of Dao-Defying Fist—sage at the end would suffer a drop in cultivation or even death.

"Earth Store Fist!" The elder, desperate, unleashed his power, brown spiritual energy surging into his fist. Knowing he couldn't escape, he chose to fight back.

"No use!" Luo Tian responded with a roar, channeling the Fivefold Dao Power into his fist. Any sage at the end would face the same fate.

Thunder roared; in an instant, Luo Tian's fist collided with the elder's. A crisp sound echoed in people's ears.

"Crack..." The elder's fist shattered, cracks spreading across his body.

"Break!" The elder cried out, decisively slicing his fractured arm with his other hand.

Blood spewed; the broken arm fell to the ground, lifeless.

"How many arms do you have left to break?" Luo Tian's face was cold, his fist striking the elder's chest again.

"Ahh!" A scream echoed through the cave as the elder, already wounded, was struck again. He shattered into flesh and blood, his body being refined by Dao energy.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian defeated the senior, thunderous explosions echoed again—five pseudo-era treasures attacking him.

"World-Era Bell!" Luo Tian's hands moved, golden world-epoch bell protecting him. The bell radiated fear in his mind against the five treasures' pressure.

But Luo Tian ignored it, roaring again and shattering the disciple of the sect where the elder had been.

The ten people's faces darkened; they were shocked by Luo Tian's quick defeat of two. They hadn't expected him to be so fierce, even against five pseudo-era treasures.

"Kid, a world-epoch bell can't block five pseudo-era treasures—this time you're dead!" they shouted, watching the treasures collide with the bell.

"Crack..." A lightning bolt flashed in people's eyes, a deafening explosion that made their ears ring.

But the ten people's faces showed excitement; in this strike, Luo Tian had no chance of survival.

"Roar!" Luo Tian roared, standing within the world-epoch bell like a demon. His blood surged, demonic energy swirling around him. His body bore countless cracks, and blood flowed from his orifices.

The world-epoch bell wasn't much better; golden cracks spread across it—this was the first time people saw pseudo-era treasures so severely damaged.

Luo Tian's hand gripped the Shangtian Spear, his breath ragged as he looked at them. Blood spewed from his mouth: "How many more times can you activate?"

"This isn't dead? What is this kid?" The ten people stared at Luo Tian, who was severely wounded but still alive.

Chapter 1068: I'm Here ()

Within the cave of gods and demons, Luo Tian leaned on his Shangtian Spear, weakly standing. His eyes scanned the ten sect elders and disciples.

"You can activate it how many more times?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile, looking at them. Black demonic energy continuously seeped from his wounds, repairing his injuries.

This time, Luo Tian was truly wounded—destructive power that allowed him to survive was a miracle. His body was in the worst condition, his flesh not yet shattered but close.

He took out a pill and swallowed it, improving his complexion slightly—still a drop in the bucket. To fully recover, he needed rest or sage herbs.

But Luo Tian had already given his last two sage herbs to Sun Mengru. Now, only the petal of the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower could instantly restore him—but he couldn't part with it.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the sects' people were slightly startled. Indeed, as Luo Tian said, they had reached their limit—since the beginning, they had activated three pseudo-era treasures.

Remembering that Luo Tian's spiritual energy was comparable to a sage at the end, he could only draw Shangtian Bow three times. Without spiritual energy to sustain a fourth activation, unless he exhausted all his strength and became helpless meat for others—this would be a loss.

Originally, there were ten people; now only nine remained, all killed by Luo Tian and Zhang Keinian. This journey into the cave had cost the sects heavily.

"Hmph, even if we can't activate it, your condition means any of us could kill you!" The如意宗 disciple sneered at Luo Tian, eager to fight.

This journey had cost the sects heavily; now only three disciples remained.

The other two disciples, hearing如意宗's words, showed excitement—killing Luo Tian would make them famous across the nine regions.

"You're not my match! Even wounded, I could kill you like slaughtering chickens!" Luo Tian coughed blood, vanishing from his spot to appear before如意宗's disciple.

"Previously, your sect provoked me!" Luo Tian's hand slammed down, his eyes showing weakness as he struck the disciple.

Though weak, this palm carried overwhelming power—sage at the middle would be bloodied.

"What is this kid made of? After being hit by five pseudo-era treasures, he still can fight with such power!" Six sage at the end elders watched Luo Tian's weak form, yet he still attacked如意宗's disciple. Their faces showed shock.

But they quickly calmed, thinking Luo Tian's attack was strong but lower than before—only able to wound a sage at the middle. For sage at the end, it was no threat.

"Die!"如意宗's disciple showed madness, throwing a jade scepter that expanded with spiritual energy to crush Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyebrows lifted, spitting more blood as he faced the mountain-like scepter. His weakness faded momentarily; he punched with Dao-Defying Fist, clashing with the scepter.

"Crack..." The heavy jade scepter collided with Luo Tian's fist, and in an instant, Luo Tian's body bent backward, blood spewing from his body.

At the same time, Luo Tian's hand struck如意宗's disciple, spiritual energy spreading. The disciple's body bore cracks on the verge of shattering.

"Get out!" Luo Tian roared, lifting his hands to throw the scepter off him. His body became a black line, appearing before the disciple and striking with a punch.

"Boom!" The disciple exploded into blood mist, visible to all.

The other two disciples' attacks also arrived instantly, crushing Luo Tian's body. His back caved in, but he endured it, turning around with a grin—his white teeth made him look terrifying.

"Everyone, strike together and kill this kid!"如意宗's disciple slowly reformed, his face pale as he looked at Luo Tian. After the attack, he was truly afraid—though Luo Tian now seemed like a sage at the beginning could kill him, he still dared not approach.

As如意宗's disciple spoke, Luo Tian fought the other two disciples, his Dao-Defying Fist constantly striking. Even with his body on the verge of shattering, he tightly controlled them.

"Strike together and finish him!" Six sage elders said, their faces showing regret as they unleashed powerful martial arts. They didn't want to waste time with Luo Tian anymore.

Six martial arts converged into a torrent, filling the cave and rushing toward Luo Tian. He slowly turned around.

"I can't take it anymore!" Luo Tian punched back the two disciples, his brows furrowed. Killing two was unsatisfactory.

"Kill one more!" He thought, his eyes showing determination. He took out Shangtian Bow, drawing an arrow and凝聚ing a black demonic arrow—the third he could fire.

"He still has spiritual energy to draw Shangtian Bow!" People watched Luo Tian's bow slowly drawing, their faces changing.

After thinking, Luo Tian aimed the arrow at如意宗's disciple because killing others was uncertain.

"Damn!"如意宗's disciple's face changed instantly; his condition was worse than Luo Tian's. If hit by the demonic arrow, he'd die for sure.

As如意宗's disciple thought, Luo Tian's black demonic arrow shot out instantly, piercing the disciple's body.

"Boom!" In people's shock,如意宗's disciple was annihilated by Luo Tian's arrow without a chance to regenerate.

Though prepared, people were still shocked. Though they could have saved如意宗's disciple earlier, Luo Tian's arrow was sudden. Three of the six sage at the end could have reacted.

But they quickly realized if Luo Tian died, they'd fight over his pseudo-era treasures and the herb's petal.

如意宗's elder's face darkened; he hadn't expected his disciple to die so soon. His eyes scanned the others, knowing their intentions after years of experience.

"I can't anymore!" Luo Tian's eyes showed weakness, his body swaying as he faced the martial arts storm. He took out the herb's petal.

He had no choice—World-epoch Seal was suppressed here, and the world-epoch book ignored him. The only option was to refine this petal to restore his peak state.

The Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower's petal was precious, but compared to his life, Luo Tian chose survival. As long as he lived, there was hope.

Thinking this, Luo Tian's hands formed seals around the petal, its vibrant vitality rushing into his body, improving his complexion.

But as he began refining the petal, a clear voice echoed, making Luo Tian's eyes light up and stop refining.

"I'm here!" The clear voice echoed in the cave, making the sects' people startled and their faces slightly changed.

They turned abruptly toward the sound's source, their faces looking unwell.

Thunderous sounds echoed in the cave; a golden map flew from afar, instantly reaching their vicinity. It passed over their heads and entered the martial arts storm.

"The Heaven's Mandate Map, a pseudo-era treasure obtained by the Divine Clan from the ancient world-epoch palace. Did the Divine Clan come?" They murmured, staring at the map unfolding instantly.

"Rustle..." The Heaven's Mandate Map entered the martial arts storm, emitting brilliant light as if opening another world. Powerful suction emerged from the map.

Light spread; the martial arts storm was instantly sucked into the Heaven's Mandate Map.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed within the map, lasting for several breaths before calming.

Two golden lights appeared before Luo Tian, shielding him. Cold energy radiated from the two figures, their cold gazes making the sects shiver.

"Why did you come so fast?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile, looking at the figure before him. He spoke as if unharmed.

"You told me to wait, why didn't you?" The voice echoed, still cold but with underlying concern that made Luo Tian happy.

"Divine Clan's Divine Daughter and Son, what do you mean?" Six sect elders asked.

Chapter 1069: The Divine Clan's Strength ()

Within the cave of gods and demons, Luo Tian stood pale, two figures—male and female—standing before him. The woman held a herb that even sacred sects would go mad for, handing it to Luo Tian.

"Why didn't you wait?" The cold voice made no difference to Luo Tian, who felt the underlying concern.

"You didn't return? Take this; I'm fine, just need rest!" Luo Tian shook his head gently, pushing the herb back.

"This was always yours. I had it sent back to the clan for the Grand Elder, who has already recovered!" Sun Mengru spoke seriously, forcing the herb back into Luo Tian's hands. She scanned the sect elders' faces with cold eyes.

"Divine Clan's Divine Daughter and Son, what do you mean?" They were startled by Sun Mengru's gaze but questioned her and Sun Feiwen.

"Ah,如意宗, Sifang Building..." Sun Feiwen smiled, approaching them and naming several sects.

"Are you questioning the Divine Clan's actions?" Sun Feiwen's eyes held mockery as he paced before them.

"We're not questioning, but this Luo Tian killed several of our sects' elders and disciples. How can we not avenge?" A disciple spoke, his voice showing dissatisfaction.

"Crack..." Suddenly, a clear slap echoed in the cave; the disciple was sent flying, colliding with golden walls. His face turned pale, nearly having his head knocked off.

Sun Feiwen's strength needed no explanation; if not for Sun Mengru's brilliance overshadowing him, he'd be the strongest young one in the Divine Clan. Even against geniuses like Feng Jiutian of Yawu and Zhou Wei of Xingluo, he had no fear.

"I'm talking to your elders; what are you? You dare speak to me!" Sun Feiwen coldly spoke, gazing at the disciple slammed against the wall. His hands emitted suction.

The disciple, recovering, was grabbed by Sun Feiwen: "Impolite trash; today I'll teach your father, mother, teacher, and sect."

Sun Feiwen's hand swung again, repeatedly striking the disciple's face. Though strong, he couldn't withstand Sun Feiwen's blows after being restrained by Luo Tian.

"Divine Sect Elder, show mercy; the youth is disrespectful, don't take it personally!" The sect elder's face turned iron, addressing Sun Feiwen.

Hearing someone plead for him, Sun Feiwen stopped his blows, gazing at the elder with amusement.

"Old man, you think your sect is so powerful in the gods and demons region? Your arrogance has grown over these years. Daring to scold us Divine Clan!" Sun Feiwen spoke lightly, scanning the group again with dominance. The six sage at the end were no match for him; the Divine Clan was like heaven in the gods and demons region. He was a Divine Clan's son, so he could act recklessly.

Luo Tian's face twitched as Sun Feiwen boasted, internally sighing about the advantage of having a powerful faction behind.

He had fought and nearly died, but Sun Feiwen's strength was inferior to his. Yet with the Divine Clan behind him, six sage at the end dared not act.

"How did he come?" Luo Tian refined the herb, his wounds healing rapidly as he asked Sun Mengru.

"I met him on the way. The cave has been active recently; the Divine Clan couldn't ignore it. They sent him to explore, and he met me. I convinced the Divine Clan's others to return, then he followed me!" Sun Mengru spoke, stepping toward Sun Feiwen.

A golden sword roared out, piercing the disciple's chest. Blood spewed toward Sun Mengru, who raised a golden shield to block it.

"You!" The sect elder's face turned dark as he watched Sun Feiwen and Sun Mengru torment his disciple. Yet, he didn't speak further.

Other sect elders also silently watched Sun Mengru stab the disciple's chest, not intending to act.

Though these sects boasted in the gods and demons region, they knew the Divine Clan's depth was terrifying. Having ruled the region for ages without falling, the Divine Clan was one of the top clans in the nine regions.

The Divine Clan's others were fine, but the Divine Daughter and Son—despite their power, these sects dared not act. The Divine Clan's wrath was beyond their ability to withstand; countless sects had been destroyed by the Divine Clan's sons and daughters over the years.

"Boom!" Sun Feiwen casually threw the disciple to the ground, his eyes playful as he stood behind Sun Mengru, clearly following her lead.

"How to handle it?" Sun Mengru's cold gaze turned toward Luo Tian, implying that if he spoke, their fates would change.

"You decide," Luo Tian shook his head gently. If it were him, he'd kill them all. But he worried that six sage at the end would be a match for Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen, fearing they'd go mad and endanger them.

"Cut off one arm and leave the cave!" Sun Mengru coldly spoke, summoning the Heaven's Mandate Map to enclose the remaining eight. The map's golden light flashed, radiating powerful pressure that made their eyes blaze with fire.

They were all influential figures in the gods and demons region, but being intimidated by a junior was hard to accept.

"Two arms!" Sun Mengru saw their hesitation and spoke again, her voice showing no mercy.
