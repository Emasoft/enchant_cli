Zheng Xin's ears twitched as he turned towards Wan Lingkong and Sun Kemin, silencing them instantly with a single glance. Their mouths snapped shut, unable to utter another word.

"Zheng Xin, you won't gloat for long. Once those three recover, your luck will run out!" Sun Kemin's face darkened as he addressed Zheng Xin.

"I... I didn't mean to. I was just telling the truth, what's wrong with that?" Zheng Xin looked genuinely wounded.

"Agh..." As they spoke, a harrowing cry echoed through the hall again. Yan Jun's face turned ashen like pig liver, nearly spitting blood.

"Yan Jun, I told you not to move! You had to!" Luo Tian's voice rang out again.

"Didn't you miss?!" The group's mouths twitched as they watched Yan Jun beside Luo Tian, sympathy flashing in their eyes.

Even Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi found their own pain less intense watching Yan Jun's agony. People always felt better when they saw others suffer more.

"Something's wrong..." Luo Tian furrowed his brows, confusion flickering in his eyes. These days, he'd learned all the body's major meridians from Run Hongyu, yet his acupuncture still missed its mark.

"Learning the Eight Gate Needles was just a stroke of luck!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, then raised his hand again, driving needles into Yan Jun one by one.

"Luo Tian, you're doing it wrong! Medicine and elixirs are both profound arts. The depth and position of the needles matter!" Run Hongyu smiled, approaching Luo Tian to demonstrate by inserting a silver needle into Yan Jun's body.

"For instance, if you wanted him to laugh, you must pierce three fen deep. That's the best effect. Too deep and it'll cause slight pain, which interferes with the ticklish sensation, making the effect much worse!" Run Hongyu inserted a silver needle into Yan Jun's body.

"Ha ha..." Silver light flashed, and laughter erupted through the hall. Yan Jun laughed uncontrollably, tears streaming down his face.

"Also, you must hit the exact meridian points. You're not aiming at life-threatening spots yet. If you miss, sometimes it can have serious consequences!" Run Hongyu smiled, pulling the silver needles from Yan Jun's body.

"Will... will it kill someone?" Hearing Run Hongyu's words, Yan Jun stopped laughing but nearly cried.

"Big brother, I really regret it!" Yan Jun addressed Luo Tian, his eyes still glistening with tears from earlier.

"Relax, Yan Jun. You don't trust me? If you stay still, I won't make a mistake!" Luo Tian chuckled, then waved his hand. Silver light flashed again, and another harrowing cry echoed through the hall.

"Yan Jun, you're being mischievous again. Didn't you hear Master Hongyu say earlier that if you miss, it could be a big problem? Be good and don't move!" Luo Tian's voice rang out again.

"Damn... it missed again... Yan Jun, you really shouldn't move..." The harrowing cries kept coming, making Sun Kemin and the others' mouths twitch.

Chapter 1604: The Third Layer

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. For Diao Dezhu, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun, these three days were the darkest of their lives. The entire hall was filled with harrowing cries.

"Tragic, never let this happen again! This guy's good at alchemy but his medical skills are terrible..." Sun Kemin muttered, wiping sweat from his face as he looked at Diao Dezhu, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun, who appeared beaten to a pulp, lying on the ground gasping for breath. They all looked thinner.

For three days, Luo Tian was fair, giving each one a day without favoring Yan Jun.

"Luo Tian, Sun Kemin said your medical skills are a bit bad..." Zheng Xin's ears twitched again as he approached Luo Tian.

"Dammit... Zheng Xin, you're asking for death..." Sun Kemin's face turned pale at Zheng Xin's words.

"Zheng Xin, may you never find peace!" Diao Dezhu, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun glared at Zheng Xin with death in their eyes. If it weren't for this gossipy troublemaker, they wouldn't have suffered so much. As they spoke, adding Sun Kemin, the four of them rushed at Zheng Xin.

"Agh..." Zheng Xin's scream echoed through the hall.

"Revenge comes when the time is right!" Wan Lingkong spoke softly, watching Zheng Xin being beaten by the four. He too joined in, leaving Chen Zhanbiao standing alone without participating.

Luo Tian ignored the group's attack on Zheng Xin, instead smiling as he sat cross-legged on the ground. His aura gradually rose.

"Buzz..." A gentle breeze stirred around Luo Tian, spreading outward. Sun Mengru and Run Hongyu stood before him.

"Boom... boom... boom..." A deep rumbling echoed from Luo Tian's body. His aura surged rapidly.

"Body Cultivation Realm... Transcendent Realm... Epoch Realm..." Half an hour later, Luo Tian's cultivation had fully recovered. The golden Wheel of Rebirth reformed in his dantian, even broader than before.

"Stop! I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." Zheng Xin pleaded as Diao Dezhu and the others beat him.

"Damn it, let's hit him again!" Sun Kemin shouted, snatching Zheng Xin's storage ring and storing it in his own without breaking it.

"Damn you, Sun Kemin! What right do you have!" Zheng Xin cursed but was kicked back by Diao Dezhu.

"Spirit compensation... what's wrong?" Xu Liyi asked, voice carrying an air of entitlement.

"Stop fighting, we're all brothers. You should understand me!" Zheng Xin pleaded desperately, looking to Luo Tian and Run Hongyu with imploring eyes—meaning they were also involved.

"I just told the truth! It was Luo Tian and Run Hongyu who tortured you!" Zheng Xin tried to shift blame onto Luo Tian and Run Hongyu.

Hearing this, Diao Dezhu's group stopped beating Zheng Xin. They turned their eyes toward Luo Tian, then shuddered slightly.

"Son of a bitch, daring to provoke us against Luo Tian's friendship!" Diao Dezhu roared and beat Zheng Xin again.

"Exactly..." Yan Jun echoed, continuing the beating. Xu Liyi and Sun Kemin followed suit.

Silly, even if Luo Tian hadn't recovered his cultivation, they wouldn't dare attack him and Run Hongyu. Considering the pain of these three days, they hated Zheng Xin more, beating him harder.

"Enough!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed Diao Dezhu's group. He didn't stop them, knowing they'd suffered much these three days. His own acupuncture technique was even hard to watch.

"Let us enjoy a little longer..." Diao Dezhu and the others replied, their voices carrying suppressed frustration.

Time passed slowly. Zheng Xin's body had grown rounder, his skin bruised and purpled as he lay there. His strength to plead had diminished.

"Enough!" Luo Tian spoke again, frowning slightly.

"Just a little longer!" But Diao Dezhu's group showed no intention of stopping.

"Buzz..." Seeing they ignored him, Luo Tian waved his hand. A string of silver needles appeared in his hands.

Silver light shot from Luo Tian's hands, instantly flying toward the four. He was so envious of Run Hongyu's ability to pin people with a wave that he wanted to try it himself.

"Ugh..." At the sight of the needles, Diao Dezhu and the others reflexively jumped far away.

Though Diao Dezhu's group escaped, Zheng Xin remained on the ground. Plus Luo Tian's acupuncture was truly unimpressive...

"Agh..." Zheng Xin's scream echoed.

"It actually works!" Luo Tian felt awkward but happy. He resolved to master this golden acupuncture technique. Even if it wasn't powerful, just being able to intimidate these bastards was worth learning.

"Ah..." Zheng Xin lay on the ground, pulling out a few silver needles. His voice was weak, as if severely wounded.

"Luo Tian, look at them—do they have any sense? I just said two truths, and they ganged up on me. You must avenge me!" Zheng Xin weakly addressed Luo Tian.

"Rest assured, I'll avenge you!" Luo Tian walked toward Zheng Xin with a smile.

"But look at how hurt you are. I'll heal your wounds first. Fortunately, my acupuncture has improved greatly these days!" Luo Tian spoke softly, pulling out a few more silver needles and gazing at Zheng Xin with shining eyes.

"Huh?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zheng Xin nearly jumped up. He flipped over and did a somersault to stand.

"No need, I'm fully recovered! Your few needles were miraculous!" Zheng Xin looked at Luo Tian with energy, though his face was bruised, his voice was strong.

"Ah... I can help reduce the swelling on your body too!" Luo Tian continued, not giving up.

"No, no need. My skin's thick and tough. Let's hurry to enter the third layer. We've spent too long in this bone forest!" Zheng Xin quickly replied. Silly, letting Luo Tian needle him was dangerous. His own injuries were nothing, but allowing Luo Tian to needle him could be life-threatening.

"Okay!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, clearly disappointed. But Zheng Xin's words made sense; they had indeed spent too long in the bone forest.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, everyone straightened up. They gathered together. Luo Tian and Run Hongyu led the way while others followed behind, ascending the second layer's steps toward the third.

After an hour of walking on the bone steps, they reached the third level. As soon as they stepped in, a fresh breeze entered their senses.

"Rustle... rustle..." Wind sounds beat against them, and a crisp sound echoed through the vast space of the third level.

"White Bone Spirit Bamboo!" Their faces turned surprised, gazing at the scene before them.

A row of bamboo stalks like white jade stood rooted in the ground. Wind from nowhere stirred each bamboo, producing a sound.

"Finally found it!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. Regardless of the purpose of this journey, they had finally achieved their goal.

"This is White Bone Spirit Bamboo!" Zheng Xin and the others gazed at the bamboo stalks connected like jade bones, their faces showing admiration. They had struggled to reach this bone forest for this very thing.

"We couldn't find a single one outside, but here there are so many!" Others sighed involuntarily.

"This is White Bone Spirit Bamboo, but its age isn't even at the Holy Medicine level!" Luo Tian shook his head. He approached a White Bone Spirit Bamboo, grabbed it from the ground, and stored it.

Though its age wasn't enough, he had the "Revitalization Scripture," so he could cultivate it.

Luo Tian collected a few more, unsure if one cultivation would succeed.

"What do we do next? Shall we go deeper?" Seeing Luo Tian store the White Bone Spirit Bamboo, Diao Dezhu asked.

"We can't go deeper to leave?" Luo Tian looked at Run Hongyu, confusion in his eyes. He wanted to know if Run Hongyu had a way out. If they could leave, it would be better to go now. Though Luo Tian felt no danger in the third level, often the calmer it was, the more hidden dangers lurked.

"I only know there's a teleportation array in the fourth level leading out of the bone forest. But my father placed his coffin in the fourth level, yet it's now in the second level. Clearly something changed. I don't know if there still is one!" Run Hongyu shook his head.

"I can try to set up a teleportation array!" Wan Lingkong spoke, looking at Luo Tian's group.

"Go to hell..." Hearing Wan Lingkong's words, Luo Tian and the others didn't hesitate, immediately dismissing the idea. Without Jiang Nanxuan, they wouldn't trust Wan Lingkong's teleportation array.

"Since we're here, come in!" As they spoke, a distant voice echoed in Luo Tian's group ears.

Chapter 1605: Immortal Traces

The distant voice made Luo Tian's group tense. They exchanged glances, gathering together and looking toward the depths of the bamboo forest.

"Who's there!" Luo Tian shouted into the bamboo forest, sending out his spiritual awareness. But he found no movement in the depths.

"Come on, I have no ill intent!" The distant voice echoed again. Luo Tian's group could only discern it was a woman's voice.

"Rustle... rustle..." As the woman's voice faded, the stairs leading to the third level behind them collapsed with a crash, vanishing from Luo Tian's group's sight. In its place was an endless abyss, a void that would mean annihilation upon entry.

"What do we do? Shall we go in?" Diao Dezhu's group looked at Luo Tian, who was now their leader.

"Go! Lingkong, set up the teleportation array and be ready to activate it!" Luo Tian ordered. Though he disliked Wan Lingkong's teleportation array, it was better than dying in the bone palace.

"Okay!" Wan Lingkong nodded. He waved his hand, and a large stone appeared beside him. Array flags were continuously planted on the stone, his face serious.

Not long after, a teleportation array capable of holding several people was drawn. Wan Lingkong stored it again.

"Go..." Luo Tian took the first step, walking into the depths of the bamboo forest.

"Rustle... rustle..." The white bamboo forest seemed eerie, producing a sound with every step they took.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, Luo Tian's group hadn't found anything unusual except the White Bone Spirit Bamboo's sounds were eerie. No danger was felt. The older the bamboo, the stronger it became.

They continued forward, walking another hour until they reached the end of the bamboo forest. Each White Bone Spirit Bamboo stood like a tree before Luo Tian's group.

"Buzz..." However, something caught their attention—a small light point emitting waves that spread outward.

"What is it? Why do I feel pressure?" Diao Dezhu looked at the white light point, though it was far away, he still felt a strong pressure on everyone.

"Could it be another Epoch Master?" Sun Kemin's face showed greed. He hadn't gained anything from the coffin of the Supreme Master before, leaving him uncomfortable.

"Strange, why does this pressure feel familiar? Like I've felt it before?" Luo Tian frowned, leading the group forward.

"What is that light point? What is it exactly?" As they walked, the group was puzzled, speculating about what the light point might be.

"Be careful. Something that can exist in the level above the Supreme Master mustn't be simple!" Though they were careful, Luo Tian still warned them.

Hundred zhang... thousand zhang... the group walked toward the light point. The closer they got, the bigger the light point became, but the invisible pressure grew stronger, slowing their pace.

"My god, this is only a short distance. The pressure is already so strong! It's about ten thousand li away from the light point. If it keeps growing like this, we can't resist it!" Diao Dezhu shouted, his eyes filled with awe.

"Indeed!" The group nodded in agreement. Their hearts were amazed; they were all nearly Epoch Masters, yet this pressure made them feel small.

"Keep going!" Luo Tian spoke. He also felt the light point was unusual, but he had no good plan at the moment.

The group walked another hour. The light point grew larger, but it was obscured by a layer of mist, hiding its true form.

Luo Tian's group estimated the distance to the light point was about eight ten thousand zhang, but the pressure they felt was immense. An Epoch Late Stage Master wouldn't be able to reach here.

"There's still so far. If the pressure keeps increasing, we can't reach there!" Diao Dezhu spoke softly.

"When you can't go on, stop. I'll go alone!" Luo Tian's eyes were serious. Though the pressure was strong, he felt he could endure it. His blood and qi were extraordinary; this pressure was a dual attack on soul and body.

"Don't let it seize your mind!" Luo Tian addressed the group, leading them forward step by step.

After walking another ten thousand zhang, except for Luo Tian, Sun Mengru, Run Hongyu, and Chen Zhanbiao, the others were drenched in sweat, breathing heavily.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian had no choice but to use the Yin-Yang Twin Fish with Sun Kemin. Black and white qi enveloped their bodies, shielding them from pressure while continuously mending their flesh.

Under the Yin-Yang Twin Fish's protection, Luo Tian's group walked another ten thousand zhang. The distance to the light point was only five ten thousand zhang, but even with the Yin-Yang Twin Fish's protection, Diao Dezhu and others sat on the ground.

"I can't move anymore!" Diao Dezhu shouted, breathing heavily. His eyes looked at the light point with fear.

"What is inside? Is it a complete body of an Epoch Master?" Zheng Xin also sat on the ground, shouting.

"I feel like the Epoch Masters are no match for whatever is in that light point. Could it be..." Wan Lingkong spoke, thinking of a terrifying possibility but didn't finish.

"Immortal..." Luo Tian sighed softly. After walking so far, he finally understood why the pressure felt so familiar.

Back then, Luo Tian's group had briefly opened the Immortal Coffin. That pressure was equally terrifying. In that pressure, Luo Tian had felt despair, unable to resist.

"I remember now. Maybe it's really an Immortal!" Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin spoke in unison. They had also opened the Immortal Coffin, feeling how terrifying that non-nine-domain aura was and even absorbed a part of it. That was destruction-inducing, just one aura could severely wound an ancient king clan's prince.

"It's confirmed. Who else but an Immortal would dare touch the Epoch Master's things!" Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin's faces showed fear, recalling the suffocating feeling from the Immortal Coffin.

"We should go back!" Wan Lingkong spoke, his voice filled with fear. Hearing Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin's words, his pores were icy.

"I have no ill intent. I'll give you a heritage to make you the strongest in this world!" The distant voice echoed again in Luo Tian's group ears.

"I don't want it. Let us leave!" Diao Dezhu shouted towards the light point, his voice filled with entreaty.

"If you want to leave, you must walk here!" The distant voice sighed longingly, making Luo Tian's group faces show bitterness.

"I don't believe it!" Wan Lingkong shouted confidently, waving his hand. The array flags planted on the stone fell into their sight.

"Stand on it, we go! Even if it's an Epoch Master's arrangement, stopping my teleportation array is impossible unless that Epoch Master has deep knowledge of arrays!" Wan Lingkong addressed the group.

"Okay!" Luo Tian nodded. At this moment, he also wanted to leave. Anything related to Immortals, he didn't want to touch. Deep down, Luo Tian felt this was a forbidden thing. Though it would gain powerful strength, obtaining that power would definitely cost an equal price.

The group stood on the teleportation array. But as Wan Lingkong sprinkled golden array flags, there was no movement, making their faces grim.

"What's wrong?" Wan Lingkong looked puzzled. He tried to activate it again but there was no movement.

"How is this possible!" Wan Lingkong's face changed, his eyes showing disbelief. He hadn't expected his teleportation array to be useless.

"Don't waste time..." Run Hongyu smiled bitterly, looking at Wan Lingkong before speaking softly: "My father was an array master..."

"Your mother... why didn't you say that earlier!" Wan Lingkong cursed softly, thinking of the previous Nine Dragons Gathering珠. He slumped onto the ground.

"I truly have no ill intent..." The distant voice echoed again, making Luo Tian's group faces show bitterness.

"You dad is really knowledgeable..." Diao Dezhu heard the distant voice and spoke, but clearly not as praise.

"There's no choice but to push forward. I just noticed that although the pressure is strong, there's a powerful force here. For the body, it has considerable benefits. Since we can't avoid it, let's take some interest first!" Luo Tian addressed the group before stepping out of the Yin-Yang Twin Fish.

"Crack..." As Luo Tian stepped out of the Yin-Yang Twin Fish, a crackling sound rose beneath his feet. His body slightly sank.

"Buzz..." The humming echoed, and Luo Tian felt the aura that wasn't from nine domains constantly striking his body.

Chapter 1606: Forging the Body

The humming echoed. Luo Tian felt strong pressure while also sensing an invisible wave striking his body.

Pain spread through Luo Tian's body, a feeling of tearing. Yet, a smile appeared on his face.

"Come out! This place really can enhance the body!" Luo Tian addressed Diao Dezhu's group, a smile on his face.

"Go as far as you can. There's no way back anyway! Eventually, we'll reach it!" Luo Tian addressed them.

"I don't know. If my body becomes stronger, will I reach the Epoch Master level?" Luo Tian's eyes shone with excitement. Though walking to that light point might have danger, all paths were now closed. He had no choice but to push forward. This opportunity of gaining strength for free was not to be missed. As for what came next, he didn't care.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian thought, the group also stepped out of the Yin-Yang Twin Fish. A sound like something falling to the ground echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

"Damn it..." Diao Dezhu roared, lying on the ground and cursing loudly.

"It's deadly..." Wan Lingkong and Xu Liyi also looked like Diao Dezhu, all in a mess. Only Run Hongyu, Chen Zhanbiao, and Sun Mengru had slightly bent bodies, standing there.

However, after a while, they adapted. They slowly got up from the ground, feeling the invisible wave striking their bodies, constantly eroding their flesh.

"Really can enhance the body!" Diao Dezhu's group showed excitement, but they didn't move forward immediately. They needed a long time to adapt to this intensity.

"I'll go first, waiting for you!" Luo Tian addressed Diao Dezhu's group and stepped forward again. His body was already extremely strong, so the effect here wasn't much for him.

Sun Mengru, Chen Zhanbiao, and Run Hongyu followed closely behind Luo Tian. Their bodies were also somewhat abnormal, so the effect here was minimal for them too.

"Four freaks!" Diao Dezhu's group looked with envy, watching the four walking toward the light point. They cursed under their breath.

One step... ten steps... Luo Tian and the others walked forward, each step. The strange aura constantly struck their bodies, forging their flesh's strength. However, the pressure grew stronger. Even Luo Tian and the others found it hard to bear.

Time passed slowly. A day had gone by, and their speed clearly slowed. Each step was difficult.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian's face was drenched in sweat, his eyes filled with excitement. In a day, they could clearly feel their bodies had greatly strengthened. This was still four ten thousand zhang away from the light point. If they continued at this rate, they couldn't imagine what level they'd reach when arriving there.

"You think we might become Immortals through our bodies?" Sun Mengru asked softly, her voice filled with doubt.

"Body Immortals!" Hearing Sun Mengru's words, Luo Tian and the others' faces changed. Their eyes showed expectation. If they truly became Body Immortals, they would sweep across the nine domains.

"No!" Run Hongyu shook his head gently. "When we reach there, if our bodies become as strong as an Epoch Master's, we should be grateful. You don't know how terrifying my father's body was. This is because he didn't focus on body cultivation. If those Epoch Masters who focused on bodies were like this, they would be even more abnormal!"

"Right! Since the nine domains were born, although there are immortal traces, no one has ever heard of anyone truly becoming an Immortal. Not even Body Immortals!" Luo Tian and the others shook their heads, feeling Sun Mengru's words were impractical.

"Even if we can't become Body Immortals or Epoch Masters, I think just reaching there will make our bodies so strong they can crush some prince kings!" Luo Tian chuckled.

"That's you. I estimate I won't reach there!" Run Hongyu shook his head gently. Though he was the son of an Epoch Master, he had some self-awareness. His blood was strong, his body stronger than Diao Dezhu's group, but compared to Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao, he was still lacking.

"Go!" Seeing the three had rested enough, Luo Tian addressed them again and continued moving forward.

"Damn it, those four went so far!" Watching Luo Tian's group's back, Zheng Xin and the others cursed again.

After some time adapting, their bodies had strengthened a bit. They continued moving forward.

The entire White Bone Palace's third level, Luo Tian and his group split into two groups. Under the immense pressure, they forged their bodies toward the light point that seemed to be surrounded by auroras.

Time passed slowly. A month had gone by, and Luo Tian and Sun Mengru's group were only one ten thousand zhang away from the massive light point.

Meanwhile, outside the nine domains, some major events had occurred.

After the Divine Clan's God King Sun Shengtian entered the Prince King stage, he announced a period of rest and recuperation. The Divine Clan fell into its most desperate phase in history. However, the more shocking event was another one: a league-like sect appeared in the Xing Luo Domain. This league, called the "Ten Thousand Realms Alliance," was founded by someone unknown.

Yet this alliance rapidly expanded, occupying half of the Xing Luo Domain. The domain master of Xing Luo, Zhou Wei, led his sect's strength to suppress it. However, they suffered heavy losses, and even Zhou Wei returned injured.

As this battle erupted, the Ten Thousand Realms Alliance quickly appeared in everyone's sight across the nine domains. Mysterious and powerful, it shocked all sects and clans.

The most surprising thing was that at this time, the domain masters of all major sects and clans, Long Jie, Yan Hongtao, and some old masters were all in seclusion, pushing to become Prince Kings.

The only Four Sacred Star Domains were too far from the Xing Luo Domain. They had sent people to investigate the Ten Thousand Realms Alliance. This investigation was no small matter, as this alliance had shaken the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Because the Four Sacred Star Domains discovered that several sects active in people's sight within this alliance were all former enemies of Luo Tian, like the Yin Yang Sect from the Divine and Demon Domain.

"Ten Thousand Realms... Ten Thousand Realms... Could this be targeting Luo Tian again?" In the Five Elements Sect of the Tianyuan Continent, Jiang Nanxuan and Luo Xiong sat together. Luo Xiong's brows furrowed as he spoke.

"Uncertain, but now our Four Sacred Star Domains are lacking in strength since Luo Tian and the others have left. However, our foundation is now deep. To attack us, they must have an Epoch Treasure and at least four Prince Kings!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice filled with confidence.

That Jiang Nanxuan, usually calm and modest, was so confident showed that the Four Sacred Star Domains' current strength was indeed very powerful.

"This is just a conservative estimate. With only one ancient ancestor helping us, if we include Dongbo Xin and Ji Jiu You as well, even if all nine domains' forces united, they couldn't take down the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Jiang Nanxuan shook his head, making people in the hall relax.

"Right! To bite down on us, let's see if they have the teeth!" People in the hall showed disdain. They didn't think any force could be a match for the Four Sacred Star Domains now.

"Alas..." Jiang Nanxuan looked at the people in the hall, sighing deeply. The Four Sacred Star Domains were indeed powerful now, but there had been changes. These years of finally standing tall had made them a bit restless.

"Also, the Thunder Domain's movements are significant. Should we check on it too?" Luo Xiong looked at Jiang Nanxuan, recalling the second major event in the nine domains.

The Thunder Domain's Thunder Sea Marsh was now controlled by the Ancient King Clan. Recently, a thunderous collision had been heard from the Thunder Domain, spreading across the nine domains. The magnitude of this sound was clearly an Epoch Treasure-level collision.

Then, news came out that the major king clans exploring the Thunder Sea Marsh had discovered the Immortal Coffin. They wanted to unite and bring their king armies into the Thunder Sea Marsh.

This news shocked not only the Ancient King Clans but also the human race. Such a shocking event was impossible to hide. Even if it was said that the Ancient King Clans and humans were isolated, both sides would send people to infiltrate the Thunder Domain and the Mortal Domain to investigate each other's movements, as they wanted to know each other's whereabouts.

"Let's observe the situation. Wait two more days, wait for news. I've heard about this Immortal Coffin from Luo Tian's group. That thing is no simple matter; whoever touches it dies. Wait until there are definite news, then I'll go!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, rubbing his temples with a headache, feeling it was quite complicated.

"It's only possible to do this! I don't know when Tian will return. Hopefully, it won't be too long. If he's really trapped for a hundred years, that would be troublesome!" Luo Xiong shook his head gently, worry in his eyes.

"It shouldn't be. They can go anywhere now. Except for the Xing Luo Domain, it seems they've been everywhere!" Jiang Nanxuan shook his head. They didn't know that at this moment, Luo Tian's group was indeed trying to find a way out of the deadly situation.

Chapter 1607: True Immortal

"Agh! I can't take it anymore!" In the third level of the White Bone Palace, shouts echoed continuously.

Zheng Xin and Diao Dezhu's group lay two ten thousand zhang away from the light point, panting heavily. Yet their bodies radiated a spiritual aura, faces filled with surprise.

It had been nearly a month since Luo Tian's group arrived at the third level of the White Bone Palace. A month, not long but not short.
