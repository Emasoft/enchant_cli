Luo Tian never imagined that he would one day save Sun Miechen, but he had no choice. At this moment, only he could rescue him; if he didn't act, it would surely provoke the resentment of the Divine Clan and harm the harmony between humans and other races.

Vibrant runes merged into Sun Miechen's flesh, accelerating his regeneration. In the blink of an eye, Sun Miechen recovered, though his face was pale as death.

"Next it's your turn!" Yu Fantiang’s expression bore coldness, his eyes flashing with sharp light. His golden wings fluttered slowly behind him.

Chapter 1465: The Manifestation of Ming Huan

"Boom..." A clamor erupted. People watched Luo Tian standing there, once again facing Yu Fantiang. Their eyes gleamed with excitement.

"Is Luo Tian about to confront the prince of the ancient kings again?" The humans' faces lit up with excitement, eager to witness Luo Tian crushing Yu Fantiang beneath his feet.

A cascade of golden light enveloped Luo Tian and Yu Fantiang, and Luo Tian's aura gradually rose. He locked eyes with Yu Fantiang.

Since he couldn't kill the prince of a king, Luo Tian had no need to hold back. The curse power would only manifest if all races were slain.

"Sorry, I'm late!" A scorching aura surged from the void, as a youth resembling a blazing sun emerged. His face bore a faint smile before his gaze swept over the crowd, darkening slightly.

"Good heavens! Another prince of the ancient kings!" The battlefield erupted in chaos, people's eyes wide with disbelief as they shouted.

"Golden Crow Clan, Jin Yangxi!" The ancient clans recognized the youth's identity, their eyes alight with excitement.

"Ku ku... this is quite lively," before the crowd could recover from Jin Yangxi's arrival, a cold voice echoed again, like a vengeful spirit appearing before them.

"Another one!" Everyone gasped in shock, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at the figure radiating overwhelming power.

"Ah!" At the moment the shadow appeared, Luo Tian's eyes turned blood-red, his killing intent bursting forth uncontrollably.

"Luo Tian, it's been a while. Did you bring what we agreed on?" Ming Huan smiled, utterly unimpressed by Luo Tian's killing intent. He addressed Luo Tian directly.

"Alongside the previous defeat of Hun Badian, this is the fourth!" The humans' faces bore worry as they watched Ming Huan's overwhelming aura beneath the stars, alongside Yu Fantiang and Jin Yangxi.

"Spit..." As people marveled, a blue sky descended, carrying an immense aura that engulfed the Golden Crow. A harrowing scream echoed within the blue qi.

Blood merged into the blue qi, golden feathers falling from the sky. The first prodigy of the ancient clans fell, facing a peril of death.

"Buzz..." Jin Yangxi spat out divine fire and vanished from his spot, appearing beneath the blue sky. The golden divine fire clashed with the azure heavens.

Jin Yangxi extended his hand, and radiant golden runes surged forth, rescuing Jin Ziyan. His face bore coldness as he gazed at Zhu Ge Qingtian standing there.

"You share the same aura as me!" Jin Yangxi's eyes ignited with battle intent, his gaze fixed on Zhu Ge Qingtian. He delivered Jin Ziyan to a peak elder of the Golden Crow Clan before addressing Zhu Ge Qingtian.

"So what?" Zhu Ge Qingtian smiled, his body wrapped in chaotic qi, eyes icy.

"Battle!" Jin Yangxi wasted no words; his aura surged skyward as he charged at Zhu Ge Qingtian.

Zhu Ge Qingtian showed no fear, his body flickering as a gray fist collided with Jin Yangxi.

The thunderous explosion echoed through the heavens. One was a disciple of an epoch's master, the other a prince of an ancient clan—both had been sealed for countless years. In their prime, they were invincible, yet in this era, they emerged to clash.

Luo Tian's eyes brimmed with fierce killing intent as he gazed at Ming Huan. He raised his hand, and a pure white light hovered in his palm. The aurora enveloped the space, distorting it.

"My junior?" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his palm holding Yuan Ci Xian Guang (Nascent Soul of the Divine), gazing at Ming Huan.

"Give me your Nascent Soul first, and I'll let your son go!" Ming Huan's eyes lit up, speaking softly.

"Do you think I'd believe your words?" Luo Tian coldly replied, doubting Ming Huan's credibility.

"You can choose not to believe me," Ming Huan said, unbothered by Luo Tian's words. "But if you don't believe me, I can send a message now—your junior will die immediately!"

"Here it is," Luo Tian didn't want to risk his descendants' lives. He waved his hand, and the Nascent Soul flew toward Ming Huan.

"Buzz..." The pure white light appeared before Ming Huan, who looked on with delight as he swallowed it.

"That's better! Your son will return soon!" Ming Huan smiled.

"If anything happens to my junior, I'll make you wish you were never born!" Luo Tian's face was icy as he spoke.

"No need," Ming Huan replied, "because you'll die today!" He flickered his body and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Let's strike him down together!" Ming Huan called to Yu Fantiang beside him, his voice cold.

"Two against one? I still have some dignity!" Yu Fantiang's face bore disdain, refusing Ming Huan's plan. As a prince of the kings, he found it disgraceful to fight with numbers against one.

Pride—each king was a titan, undefeated in their era. As princes of kings, they were equally proud and refused to ally with others.

"Still, I must kill that wild man who once tried to eat my clan!" Yu Fantiang turned his gaze toward Chen Zhanbiao, who stood out prominently.

"What!" Upon hearing Yu Fantiang's words, Cao Dezhu and others' faces changed instantly. They gazed at Yu Fantiang standing there.

"What do we do? No one can match Yu Fantiang now!" The humans' faces bore shock as they watched Yu Fantiang standing there.

"Damn it, Zhanbiao! You ate too much and got into trouble!" Xu Liyi and others glared at Chen Zhanbiao, their eyes filled with reproach.

"Uh..." Chen Zhanbiao scratched his head, smiling awkwardly: "It's just a fight. I haven't fought in ages. Let's fight!"

Chen Zhanbiao took a bold step forward, his eyes alight with excitement. Though he knew Yu Fantiang was no easy opponent, Chen Zhanbiao felt an exhilarating energy coursing through him.

"Luo Tian!" Luo Tian leapt into action, rushing toward Yu Fantiang to draw him into his attack range. He didn't want Chen Zhanbiao to be harmed, intending to fight two opponents alone.

"Arrogant! Did you forget your humiliation under my hands?" But as Luo Tian moved, a cold laugh rose behind him. A gray hand, brimming with overwhelming power, descended upon Luo Tian.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's face darkened as he turned sharply to confront Ming Huan, now constrained.

"Wild man! Die!" Yu Fantiang sneered at Chen Zhanbiao's massive form, brandishing a golden feather to strike.

In Yu Fantiang's view, Chen Zhanbiao's strength was commendable but still no match for him.

Golden divine light flashed instantly, piercing Chen Zhanbiao's chest.

"Join forces!" Seeing Chen Zhanbiao in danger, Cao Dezhu and others couldn't stay still. Two flashes of light appeared before Chen Zhanbiao, blocking the golden divine light.

Cao Dezhu and Zheng Xin were the swiftest, appearing before Chen Zhanbiao with grim expressions.

At the same time, Xu Liyi, Gu Lei, Yang Jinghua, Hu Tianzong and others also appeared before Chen Zhanbiao. Their eyes were cautious as they watched Yu Fantiang.

"Haha, joining forces? No big deal!" Yu Fantiang looked at them with disdain, utterly dismissing their presence. He let out a light laugh as his aura rose gradually.

"Kill!" Xu Liyi and others felt no shame in surrounding one person; they all attacked Yu Fantiang.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed as Luo Tian endured Ming Huan's attack. He saw Cao Dezhu and others fighting Yu Fantiang, exhaling a long breath of relief.

Luo Tian knew the group's strength well. If they ganged up, they had a chance against Yu Fantiang—enough to hold out for a long time.

With no more threats, Luo Tian turned his gaze filled with killing intent toward Ming Huan. He truly wished to kill Ming Huan, but he hesitated—Luo Li and others were still in Ming Huan's grasp.

Though Luo Tian hesitated, Ming Huan did not. His face twisted with ferocity as he soared into the sky, his hands moving to form a massive gray hand that descended upon Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, do you think I'd let your son go? Your son and juniors are already on their way! In two days, I'll send them to you as mummified corpses!" Ming Huan smiled mockingly, his gray hand striking. At the same time, a large seal flew from Ming Huan's palm toward Luo Tian.

"What!" Upon hearing Ming Huan's words, Luo Tian's face turned pale. He stood there in shock.

As Luo Tian was stunned, the gray hand struck his body, sending him plummeting into the stars.

The gray seal followed closely, crushing Luo Tian who spat blood, emitting a resounding crack. The overwhelming gray qi engulfed Luo Tian, leaving the humans in disbelief.

"What's going on? Why isn't Luo Tian fighting back!" The humans cried out, watching Luo Tian vanish from their sight. Why had the mighty Luo Tian, who had just defeated Hun Badian, become so helpless in an instant? It was as if he were frozen.

Chapter 1466: Battle Against Ming Huan

"What's happening?" Everyone was stunned by the sight before their eyes, disbelief etched on their faces. How could Luo Tian, who had been so powerful before, be unable to fight back against Ming Huan?

"I remember! Luo Tian's juniors were captured by Ming Huan!" Someone suddenly recalled the chaos in the Four Sacred Star Domains when they searched desperately for Ming Huan and Luo Li.

"Did Ming Huan say he killed Luo Li?" Though Ming Huan's words were soft, they weren't whispered. Many heard them.

"What!" The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains trembled, especially Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian. They stood there trembling, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"I must return to check if the soul-lamps of those boys are still burning!" Luo Xiong leapt into action, flying toward the Four Sacred Star Domains. At this moment, he no longer cared about the invasion of the ancient clans.

"Sky...!" Luo Nantian furrowed his brows, though he was heartbroken. His gaze remained on the Luo Tian engulfed in gray qi. If Luo Li and others were in trouble, Luo Tian couldn't be harmed either.

The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains gathered their glares, their auras of destruction rising. If Luo Nantian gave the order, they would charge at the ancient clans. Even if their strength was inferior, they had no fear.

Luo Li and the other children were the hope of the Four Sacred Star Domains, raised by many. If they truly met misfortune, the entire domain would go mad.

"Impossible!" Luo Xiting's body trembled as her eyes deepened, gazing into the void. Two streaks of blood flowed from her eyes.

"They won't die! My Luo Tian's juniors won't die so easily!" A low roar echoed within the gray qi, a figure with an overwhelming aura emerging from it.

Cracks formed on Luo Tian's body, dark qi spilling out of them. Blood covered his body; his eyes were blood-red as he stared at Ming Huan, a wild wave of energy rising from him.

"Luo Tian!" The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains roared, watching Luo Tian's strange state with concern.

"Fight! March into the Origin Domain and eradicate the Yin Clan completely!" The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains growled, waiting for Luo Tian to speak. Once he did, they would charge at the ancient clans.

"No need," Luo Tian's low voice rose. Though he was at his peak madness, he hadn't lost his mind. He knew that if they fought recklessly, the Four Sacred Star Domains would be destroyed.

"Kill!" Luo Tian stopped the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains, his body transforming into a streak of black light. Like a reborn demon god, he rushed toward Ming Huan.

"Once you were helpless under me; now what are you?" Ming Huan's words carried disdain, but his heart tightened. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to still have such power after two attacks.

"Great Dao Seals the Demon!" Black fists carried overwhelming energy, black rune chains like serpents coiling around Luo Tian's arms. A punch that could collapse the stars struck Ming Huan.

"Once I subdued you; now, in the later epoch, you're still nothing to me!" Ming Huan's eyes also bore ferocity. He recalled his past mistake against Luo Tian, his aura surging as he clashed with him.

"Boom... Boom..." Luo Tian fought like a madman, ignoring Ming Huan's attacks and only dodging the fatal ones.

A torrent of blood spilled from their bodies, Ming Huan's heart filled with shock. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to become so变态 after his ascension.

"Going on like this, we'll both die!" Ming Huan shouted, struck in the chest by Luo Tian's punch and nearly pierced.

"Die then!" Luo Tian roared, struck in the head by Ming Huan's punch. His body swayed for a moment before rushing toward Ming Huan again.

"Die!" Ming Huan's face darkened, unwilling to be killed by Luo Tian. He retreated, no longer engaging with him. His hands formed seals, and gray qi surged from his palms. Howling, it transformed into a host of vengeful souls, coalescing into a soul king that lunged at Luo Tian.

"Seal the Soul!" Luo Tian sneered, a fingertip shot out, sending an invisible wave around the fierce soul king.

"Roar..." The next moment, the soul king's aura surged skyward, its massive body trembling violently. Its eyes flashed red light and turned to attack Ming Huan.

"Damn! I forgot that soul attacks are ineffective against him!" Ming Huan gritted his teeth, recalling his previous defeat. However, the Yin Clan specialized in soul cultivation; thus, Ming Huan instinctively used a soul-based technique.

"Buzz..." A gray net erupted from Ming Huan's hands, instantly annihilating the massive soul king.

The gray qi surged, but as Ming Huan eliminated the soul attack, a black foot stepped onto the gray qi. It landed on Ming Huan's head—Mian Qi Ta's fifth step.

"Boom..." Ming Huan reacted slowly, his body cracked under the black foot's impact. Blood spewed from Luo Tian's feet.

"Vast God Step Six Shatters the Ages!" Luo Tian's low voice echoed, no hesitation as he launched his sixth step.

"Yin King's Fist, Shattering the Underworld!" Ming Huan roared, his hand clenched. A Yin King's image formed behind him, mirroring Ming Huan as he punched.

The gray fist carried overwhelming waves, striking Luo Tian's massive leg.

Another explosion echoed in the stars as both Luo Tian and Ming Huan, battered by the fierce blast, turned pale.

"So strong... this kid's changes are too big!" Ming Huan's eyes widened with shock, forcing himself to stabilize.

But Ming Huan's speed was fast; Luo Tian's was faster.

"Vast God Step Seven Shatters the Ages!" A mad roar echoed through the stars, a tangible Vast God figure forming. The wild aura spread from the towering figure.

"Not enough!" Luo Tian felt the Vast God's strength but knew that the seventh step required terrifying epoch power.

"Boom..." The black reincarnation body in Luo Tian's dantian shattered with a thunderous explosion. Then, it surged into the Vast God figure behind him.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed as Luo Tian stood in the sky, taking a step forward. The Vast God figure behind him also took a step.

"The seventh step of the Vast God Step!" The ancient clans' faces bore shock as they watched the foot radiating supreme power. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

The Vast God Step was a technique exclusive to the Vast Clan, and only one person in the entire clan could perform it—the soul of the Vast Clan, Elder Mian.

But now, a human named Luo Tian had taken the seventh step. This exceeded the ancient clans' comprehension.

The black foot, as if emerging from antiquity, shattered countless realms, carrying immense power and descending upon Ming Huan who had just stopped.

"Yin King's Anger, Killing All Under Heaven!" Ming Huan's face changed drastically. He gazed at the apocalyptic foot, a death threat enveloping his soul.

The gray Yin King's figure also formed behind Ming Huan, a towering silhouette holding a gray long sword that could harvest all life.

"Can't hold it!" Ming Huan's sense of crisis remained intense, his eyes flashing with cruelty. He spat out a streak of white light from his mouth—exactly the Yuan Ci Xian Guang (Nascent Soul of the Divine) he had taken from Luo Tian.

The white light carried a tremendous fluctuation, expanding instantly and imprinting itself into the gray long sword.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed as Yuan Ci Xian Guang took over the gray sword, and the sword's power surged. The divine light transformed into a world-shattering blade, which the Yin King's figure slowly wielded.

"Who do you think your things are so easily taken?" Luo Tian's face bore coldness as he watched Ming Huan using Yuan Ci Xian Guang. A cruel smile formed on his lips.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's words hadn't finished when a powerful suction appeared in his hand, instantly sweeping into the Yin King's sword.

In people's shock, the white blade suddenly broke free from the sword and flew back to Luo Tian's hand. He collected it.

"Damn!" Ming Huan's face darkened instantly, never expecting Luo Tian to still control the Yuan Ci Xian Guang he had cultivated.

"Rest assured, I won't let you die easily. I'll make you endure the most brutal suffering in the world!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with ferocity. Thinking of Luo Li and others who had died, his heart felt like it was bleeding.

Gu Qianxue and Sun Mengru were still missing. At this moment, his son, disciples, and even his brother's sons had died. Luo Tian had no face to meet Gu Qianxue.

In his madness, Luo Tian raised his arm again, pointing his finger at the gray long sword held by the Yin King.

"Another of that move!" The ancient clan's peak elder's face suddenly changed in the void.

"Be careful, this kid can make weapons ineffective!" The ancient clan's peak elder warned, his voice instantly reaching Ming Huan.

"Eight Directions Soul-Subduing Technique!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed, an invisible wave surging from his hand.

Chapter 1467: Capturing Two Enemies

"Buzz..." The invisible wave instantly affected the gray Yin sword, causing Ming Huan's face to change again.

"Damn!" Ming Huan's soul trembled, sensing the Yin King's sword was no longer under his control.

"Yin King's Palace!" Ming Huan roared, a sinister palace suddenly emerging from above his head. It enveloped him.

"No use! No one can save you today!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness, his voice constantly spitting blood. Two uses of the Eight Directions Soul-Subduing Technique had greatly drained him, his soul feeling disoriented.

"Primordial Heaven Palace!" Luo Tian's hands formed seals, golden palaces radiating brilliant light. He activated them, colliding with the sinister Yin King's Palace.

"Boom..." The golden palace carried overwhelming waves, clashing with the Yin King's Palace.

The stars collapsed, terrifying waves spreading outward. This was the first time humans and ancient clans used epoch treasures and royal weapons against each other.

Like an apocalypse, it stunned people's minds, even several epoch peak elders looked grim.

"Not done yet!" Luo Tian roared, his black foot finally descending, crushing Ming Huan's body with a terrifying impact.

The Yin King's figure exploded, and the entire world fell silent in people's shocked gazes. The Vast God's seventh step directly annihilated Ming Huan, blood scattering across the stars.

"Crack..." A wild wave swept out, instantly sweeping over Luo Tian's body and causing his flesh to crack with a sound. Blood spewed from his mouth.

But Luo Tian seemed unaffected, enduring the world-ending storm and rushing toward Ming Huan's blood mist.

"Ah..." As he flew, Luo Tian let out a long roar. Bloodied flesh was torn away in the storm, and blood splattered across the stars.

Like teleportation, Luo Tian appeared before Ming Huan's blood mist. At this moment, Luo Tian was in a pitiful state—his body gasped for breath, bloodied everywhere. His entire body seemed peeled open, with white bones exposed.

"Seal the Soul!" No matter how severe his injuries were, Luo Tian ignored them. He extended his hand, drawing out gray qi from the slowly forming blood flesh. Eventually, it condensed into a weak soul—Ming Huan's.

"Shi..." Seven-colored flames flew from Luo Tian's hand, instantly burning Ming Huan's soul. A harrowing scream echoed through the stars.

"Buzz..." The ancient palace erupted with divine light, enveloping Ming Huan's soul before storing it in the Primordial Heaven Palace.

"Ah..." Before people could recover from Luo Tian's formidable state, another harrowing scream echoed in their ears.

Luo Tian's blood-red eyes flashed, turning to the source of the scream. His aura surged again: "Killing one is killing; killing two is also killing!"

In his view, Cao Dezhu, Chen Zhanbiao, Xu Liyi and others were in a pitiful state. Their bodies were covered in blood, staining the stars red. Their bodies had countless divine lights embedded within them, rushing into their bodies.

Before them stood Yu Fantiang, his face cold, a golden feather fan hovering above his head. It radiated an overwhelming aura.

"Ah..." Chen Zhanbiao gazed at Cao Dezhu and Xu Liyi's pitiful state, his eyes turning red.

Chen Zhanbiao was simple-minded but not foolish. He knew he had caused the trouble; if it weren't for his gluttony, they might not be in this pitiful state now.

"Roar..." Chen Zhanbiao let out a low roar, his body resembling a primordial beast. He went mad and rushed toward Yu Fantiang.

"Overestimating yourself!" Yu Fantiang's eyes bore disdain, watching Chen Zhanbiao's wounded body rushing toward him. He sneered.

Chen Zhanbiao's flesh was indeed strong, rare to find, but his strength still lagged behind Yu Fantiang.

"Boom..." A golden feather-like divine light struck Chen Zhanbiao's shoulder, but it didn't stop his massive body.

"Crack..." The massive body collided with Yu Fantiang's, echoing like a thunderclap in the stars.

"Zhanbiao!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed, instantly appearing before Chen Zhanbiao who was thrown back. His gaze bore concern.

"This foolish kid!" Cao Dezhu and others smiled bitterly, knowing Chen Zhanbiao had gone mad again.

"Roar..." But Chen Zhanbiao seemed to have lost his mind, with a thunderous sound in his body. His face bore ferocity, as if he hadn't felt the injuries. He broke free from Luo Tian's grip and rushed toward Yu Fantiang again.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's blood-red eyes showed confusion, sensing something was off with Chen Zhanbiao. It seemed some part of his body had been awakened.

"Not right!" Luo Tian's eyes regained clarity, watching Chen Zhanbiao rush toward Yu Fantiang again. He muttered lowly and stopped Xu Liyi and others from helping Chen Zhanbiao.

"Boom..." No surprise, the next moment, Chen Zhanbiao's massive body was thrown back again. This was due to his thick skin; if it were anyone else, they would have been killed instantly.

Blood covered Chen Zhanbiao's body, but he rushed toward Yu Fantiang again. Xu Liyi and others' eyes bore pity.

"His soul is reviving!" Luo Tian gazed at the distance, his eyes showing understanding. Due to his sensitivity to souls, he could feel a terrifying aura reviving within Chen Zhanbiao's body.

"One... two..." Time passed slowly, and Chen Zhanbiao's body could no longer endure. He was about to collapse, his eyes gradually becoming hazy. His vitality slowly faded.

"Terrifying flesh! But it's still useless!" Yu Fantiang gazed at Chen Zhanbiao, then turned his gaze to Luo Tian's pitiful state.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian extended a hand, and powerful vitality surged from it into Chen Zhanbiao's body.

With the addition of vitality, Chen Zhanbiao's face improved slightly. His fresh blood rose from his body, forming strange symbols that spread across his entire form.

"Is this the ancient Vast Clan's markings? This big guy is from the Vast Clan?" Several epoch peak elders watched Chen Zhanbiao's body filled with blood symbols, their eyes wide with disbelief.

"I said humans couldn't be this big!" Several peak elders looked enlightened, sighing softly.

"I still have some curiosity about what this big guy's identity is," several peak elders looked at Chen Zhanbiao with a hint of interest.

As for Ming Huan, who had been captured by Luo Tian, they didn't worry about his safety. After all, they had already intimidated him before. If Ming Huan truly died, it would spark a war between the two clans. They knew humans also didn't want to see that outcome.

"Buzz..." Under people's curious gazes, the blood symbols merged into Chen Zhanbiao's body.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." After the blood symbols merged into his body, Chen Zhanbiao's aura surged violently.

A wild aura spread from his body, blood surging to the heavens. At the same time, Chen Zhanbiao's injuries rapidly healed.

"Crack..." After his injuries were healed, a series of cracking sounds echoed again. In the astonished gazes of Luo Tian and others, Chen Zhanbiao's body grew again.

In an instant, Chen Zhanbiao's body expanded to nearly twenty feet and continued growing until it reached twenty feet.

"Prince of the ancient kings!" The next moment, everyone was stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at the towering figure nearly twenty feet tall.

"Vast God Step Seven Shatters the Ages!" A deep voice echoed through the stars, like a thunderclap. His thick foot struck out, and the Vast God figure rose behind Chen Zhanbiao as if reborn. His eyes were gentle, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao.

"Boom..." One step forward shattered the ages. The entire starry sky seemed to consist of only this foot. Its overwhelming power was even more formidable than Luo Tian's seventh step.

"This is the true Vast God Step!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration, watching the foot that had struck Yu Fantiang. He spoke softly.

"Boom..." Blood mist rose as Yu Fantiang, after a series of battles, was still strong but not at his peak.

"My Vast Clan's Vast God child has finally been found!" Elder Mian's face bore excitement as he laughed.

The Vast Clan had been somewhat weak among the clans in recent years. One reason was that they had fewer epoch peak elders than other clans, but Elder Mian never cared. He knew as long as he was alive, no other clan's epoch peak elders would dare to challenge the Vast Clan.

Another reason was that other clans had left heirs of kings, but the Vast God had never revealed where his heir was. Without a king's direct bloodline, this made the clans somewhat不服.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian used the幽冥鬼步 (Yin Ghost Step), instantly appearing before Yu Fantiang's soul. He grabbed Yu Fantiang's soul in his hand.

"Yu Fantiang, I'll see what arrogance you have now!" Cao Dezhu and others' faces bore ferocity as they flew toward Luo Tian, their eyes mocking Yu Fantiang's soul.

Chapter 1468: Killing Them Is Killing Them

"Let me go!" Yu Fantiang's gray face bore ferocity. Under Luo Tian's hand, he felt the overwhelming pressure from Luo Tian's aura, his soul trembling. Not a soul, but one could not resist the power of a soul-sealing master. It was impossible to fight back.

"Master Luo!" Several peak elders of the ancient clans flew up, standing above Luo Tian's head. Their eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

"Release the two princes of the ancient clans, and we'll make a concession. We won't invade humans within ten years," several peak elders spoke to Luo Tian, not acting recklessly.

"I can release Yu Fantiang's soul, but Ming Huan is impossible!" Luo Tian's eyes turned blood-red again. He waved his other hand, and the suffering Ming Huan appeared before people's eyes.

At Ming Huan's appearance, a harrowing scream echoed through the stars, making people's faces tremble. A soul of epoch late stage could emit such a harrowing scream, indicating the pain it endured.

"This is an ancestor!" In Luo Tian's storage ring, Gu Lechang's soul watched Ming Huan's suffering and resolved to obey Luo Tian from now on.

The ancient clans fell silent, their eyes gazing at Luo Tian. In an instant, three princes of the ancient clans had been defeated—two were beaten to blood and reborn, one was captured, and another was crushed by Chen Zhanbiao. This shattered the myth of the ancient clan princes' invincibility.

What stunned people most was that the Vast Clan's Vast God child had appeared in such a way, leaving the clans stunned.

"Impossible! Both must be released; otherwise, we'll go to war!" Several peak elders' faces bore anger. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to dare kill two princes of the ancient clans before their eyes.

"My juniors are all dead. How can I let go of my enemies? I can't!" Luo Tian grabbed Ming Huan's soul in his hand, his eyes wild.

"Kill him!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei's eyes also flashed with hatred, gazing at Ming Huan's suffering form. Their hands changed constantly, and runes flew from their palms, imprinting on Ming Huan's soul.

"Kill me, and you'll all die with me!" Ming Huan roared, his voice weak but still ferocious.

"Die!" Luo Tian's hand clenched, and seven-colored flames instantly wrapped Ming Huan's soul. A stream of blue smoke rose from Luo Tian's hand.

"Die!" Several peak elders' faces changed instantly, their eyes gazing at Luo Tian. Their auras rose.

"Are you daring to attack me? If so, you'll have to sacrifice another!" Luo Tian's other hand slightly gathered, and Yu Fantiang's soul also screamed desperately.

Seeing Luo Tian's actions, the several ancient clan elders stopped their movements, their faces grim as they gazed at Luo Tian.
