“Master of Severing Heaven, the coffin he once prepared for his own burial!” Dongbo Xin sighed softly, his eyes flashing with a glimmer of divine light.

“Hiss…” Upon hearing Dongbo Xin’s words, Luo Tian inhaled sharply, astonished that the coffin’s origin was so grand.

“What lies within it?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened with fear, imagining the sheer magnitude of such a tomb if the Master of Severing Heaven had perished here.

“It is empty!” Dongbo Xin shook his head gently. If the Master of Severing Heaven’s physical form had truly been within that ancient coffin, this hall would not be in its current state.

“Come,” Dongbo Xin strode forward, “the two who entered before you seem to have encountered trouble.” He led Luo Tian along the gray mountain path toward the summit.

Luo Tian dared not hesitate; with such a power safeguarding him, no rival could withstand his might.

“Senior, are you truly fully recovered?” Luo Tian asked doubtfully as they walked, confirming repeatedly that Dongbo Xin had not gone mad. Finally, he exhaled in relief, his eyes alight with excitement.

“Haha, Sun Kelnian, you will regret this!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with a cold smile as he followed Dongbo Xin toward the mountain peak.

After half an hour of travel, they encountered two more perilous trials. Two epoch-end kings’ bodies, their flesh imbued with faint sentience, attacked them—but Dongbo Xin crushed them all with a single punch. Luo Tian’s awe of Dongbo Xin’s power deepened, confirming that even among epoch-end masters, he was an unparalleled force.

After half an hour, they finally reached the true summit of Zongdao Mountain, and Luo Tian’s face bore a look of admiration.

“Stunning!” Luo Tian gazed at the towering cliff, sensing an awe-inspiring aura radiating from it, as if a colossal figure stood there.

Below the cliff, several withered corpses stood motionless, their eyes filled with confusion. Two battered figures hovered above them, their bodies protected by a radiant light of the epoch.

One figure was Sun Kelnian, whom Luo Tian had met earlier; the other was a man clad in crimson robes, his body glowing with an intense red light.

“Tu Feiyang?” Luo Tian gasped, his eyes wide with disbelief. He had not expected Tu Feiyang to be the third to obtain the key to Zongdao’s domain.

“Luo Tian!” Seeing Luo Tian approach, Tu Feiyang and Sun Kelnian exchanged glances. Tu Feiyang had not anticipated Luo Tian’s arrival as a heir to the inheritance, while Sun Kelnian was surprised that Luo Tian had exited the hall so swiftly.

“Senior, you seem to have encountered trouble,” Luo Tian observed the two figures surrounded by the mindless epoch-end bodies. Though gaunt, their presence radiated an overwhelming aura. If not for their special methods, they would have already perished.

“These must be the remaining souls sealed by the Master of Severing Heaven,” Luo Tian mused, watching the figures attack Tu Feiyang and Sun Kelnian. His confidence in Dongbo Xin’s protection left him unafraid of their threat.

“Luo Senior, let us unite to subdue these puppets,” Sun Kelnian urged, his expression grim.

“Ah! No time!” Luo Tian crossed his arms, a mocking glint in his eyes.

“Senior, these two are no good—do not assist them,” Luo Tian turned respectfully to Dongbo Xin.

“Hmph.” Dongbo Xin nodded, his gaze fixed on the gray cliff, a look of solemnity in his eyes.

Sun Kelnian and Tu Feiyang were no fools; they immediately sensed Dongbo Xin’s unparalleled strength.

“Luo Senior, we are all human—why should humans torment each other? Look, will you let this elder rescue me instead of caring for this half-human, half-ghost?” Sun Kelnian bellowed.

“Who are you calling half-human, half-ghost?” Tu Feiyang roared, his crimson head glowing with bloodlight, forming countless blood-formed bodies to repel the attacks.

“Senior, that man is the one who sealed you earlier. And this one is a prodigy of the ancient Blood Clan,” Luo Tian explained to Dongbo Xin.

“What?” Sun Kelnian’s body trembled, his Yang Fish flickering as he nearly lost control of the attack.

“Yes, that ancient coffin contained you. And it was you who had been subduing him all along!” Luo Tian crossed his arms, watching Sun Kelnian with a mocking gaze.

“Ah… Senior, I was mistaken! I didn’t mean to!” Sun Kelnian trembled, his eyes darting toward Dongbo Xin. The thought of having subjugated such a power filled him with dread.

“I didn’t mean to! I had no idea it was you!” Sun Kelnian hurriedly explained, fearing Dongbo Xin’s wrath.

“Wait—this time, let us save this Blood Clan youth and gain a debt of gratitude. The ancient clans will soon emerge; we may need this favor.”

“You should observe their strength—after all, you are still in the early epoch, while they have reached the middle. See how much you lag behind,” Dongbo Xin conveyed mentally to Luo Tian.

Chapter 1371: The Spirit of Zongdao Mountain

Luo Tian nodded, his gaze on the two. He understood that ten years had created a gap between him and these prodigies, and this was the perfect chance to gauge their differences.

He also gleaned another piece of information from Dongbo Xin’s words: the ancient clans were about to awaken.

“Too strong! If this continues, they will be crushed!” Dongbo Xin observed the two with no chance of retaliation. He leapt forward, striking one of the gaunt bodies with a single punch.

“Boom…” The epoch-end master crumbled instantly, his lifeless form annihilated by Dongbo Xin’s fist.

“Damn!” Sun Kelnian stared at the mighty Dongbo Xin, his eyes filled with reverence. These bodies, though lifeless and their minds corrupted, still possessed terrifying strength. Even an epoch-end master would struggle to survive against them. Yet Dongbo Xin had dispatched one with a single punch.

“Stronger than my Blood Clan’s epoch-end masters!” Tu Feiyang shuddered, watching Dongbo Xin charge toward another elder. His eyes bore a heavy gaze.

The Blood Clan had its own epoch-end masters, but Tu Feiyang felt that this Dongbo Xin would crush their strongest without hesitation.

“If the human race has such a power, perhaps our clan will change its stance,” Tu Feiyang mused.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous echoes echoed across the cliff, and within a few breaths, the gaunt elders were all obliterated by Dongbo Xin’s punches. Only two remained, still attacking Tu Feiyang and Sun Kelnian.

“Enough,” Dongbo Xin’s long hair fluttered as he returned to Luo Tian’s side. His eyes glowed with divine light, his gaze fixed on the gray cliff, his brow furrowed.

“Old man, just finish them off!” Sun Kelnian implored, but Dongbo Xin said nothing. His aura coalesced like a heavy mountain, pressing on Luo Tian with suffocating force.

“Finally emerged,” Dongbo Xin’s battle spirit surged as he barked at the gray cliff, his voice forming an invisible wave that struck it.

“Who are you? Why disrupt my affairs!” The cliff echoed with a deep voice, like thunder in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Come forth and fight!” Dongbo Xin soared into the air, transforming into an eagle as he flew toward the cliff.

“Kill!” The echo resounded, and the entity within the cliff sensed Dongbo Xin’s might. A wave of killing intent surged as a gray figure materialized before Luo Tian, its face obscured by mist.

“What is this!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in fear, a sense of reverence stirring within him. This feeling was one he had only known from the Epoch Masters.

“Who is this? Is it the Master of Severing Heaven!” Not only Luo Tian, but Tu Feiyang and Sun Kelnian also felt the gray figure’s power.

“No, it is not the Master of Severing Heaven. It is his malevolent will fused with Zongdao Mountain’s spirit,” Dongbo Xin’s long hair flew as he faced the figure.

“My heavens!” Sun Kelnian could not speak, his eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at the two figures locked in confrontation.

“Kill!” Dongbo Xin’s battle spirit surged, undeterred by the entity’s might. He lunged toward the gray figure with a punch.

“Die!” The figure roared, its massive fist met Dongbo Xin’s with caution but still charged forward.

“Crack…” The collision shattered the sky, waves of energy surged, and both figures vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

“This old man is too fierce! Even the Master of Severing Heaven’s malevolent will—he dares to fight it! He is my idol!” Sun Kelnian shouted, his Yang Fish countering the remaining gaunt elder.

“Luo Senior, help me!” Sun Kelnian implored Luo Tian, who merely scoffed.

“Go to hell…” Luo Tian crossed his arms, his gaze heavy as he watched Tu Feiyang battle the elder.

Without prior pressure, Tu Feiyang’s strength gradually revealed itself. His cultivation had reached the middle epoch, and he was terrifying even against lifeless epoch-end masters. With his bloodlight head, he repelled the attacks without a single misstep.

“Fight yourself!” Luo Tian urged Sun Kelnian, eager to test his strength. In Luo Tian’s mind, Sun Kelnian was enigmatic—years of wandering tombs and evading assassins yet always alive.

“Damn it! What’s so tough about this dead old man? I won’t let you defeat me!” Sun Kelnian cursed, realizing Luo Tian would not help. His face darkened as he activated his Yang Fish, charging toward the elder with a violent strike.

The thunderous echoes of battle echoed across Zongdao Mountain as Sun Kelnian and Tu Feiyang clashed with the epoch-end elder.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed, observing their techniques. He knew they had caught up with him. Ten years ago, he could have easily subdued Tu Feiyang, but now, the latter had grown formidable. Ten years were brief for ordinary people but transformative for prodigies.

Luo Tian had no need to worry about their safety; they would surely exhaust the elders soon.

Yet he was more concerned for Dongbo Xin’s safety. The human race relied on him, and Dongbo Xin had warned of the ancient clans’ emergence. With his presence, they would hesitate to act.

The thunderous echoes of battle continued in the sky, golden blood sprinkled from the void, deepening Luo Tian’s concern.

“That power is formidable, but the malevolent will of an Epoch Master is essentially a fragment of their soul. An epoch-end master cannot withstand it,” Tu Feiyang’s eyes gleamed as he transformed into a bloodlight streak, striking the elder’s back with his head.

The lifeless elder instantly turned to dust at Tu Feiyang’s feet.

“Die! Fight me!” Sun Kelnian’s hands glowed white, his Yang Fish transforming into a blazing sun. The intense refining power scorched the elder, reducing him to ash in the mountain wind.

“Both are strong!” Luo Tian sighed quietly as he watched Tu Feiyang and Sun Kelnian swiftly eliminate their foes. If it were him, he would not have acted so quickly—even with his Yin Fish.

“Luo Tian, dare to fight?” Tu Feiyang’s black hair flew as he gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes ablaze with battle spirit.

“No interest,” Luo Tian shook his head. Though he no longer feared Tu Feiyang, he did not wish to take risks; the latter surely had more tricks.

“Coward! I haven’t seen you in years, and you’ve made no progress—still just an early epoch!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes flashed with disdain. He recalled the fear he had felt ten years ago when Luo Tian dominated him. At that time, Luo Tian was truly unmatched among his peers in the Blood Clan.

Now, they had all advanced to the middle epoch while Luo Tian remained stagnant. If this continued, his threat would diminish.

“Ten years ago, would you dare speak to me like that? If you wish to fight, wait until I obtain the Master of Severing Heaven’s inheritance!” Luo Tian shook his head, gazing at the gray cliff. He urgently needed to enhance his strength, and this inheritance was the best path.

“Zongdao Mountain!” Before Luo Tian could examine it further, Sun Kelnian’s voice echoed in his ears.

“This is Zongdao Mountain!” Tu Feiyang, upon observing it closely, bore a look of excitement.

“Zongdao Mountain’s spirit has merged with the malevolent will of the Epoch Master. Thus, it is now leaderless. This mountain belongs to me!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes gleamed with light as he soared toward Zongdao Mountain, his bloodlight energy surging into the gray cliff.

“With me here, no treasure is beyond my grasp!” Sun Kelnian’s eyes flashed greed as he leapt onto the cliff.

“Zongdao Mountain! The mountain forged by the Master of Severing Heaven, containing all his martial arts and techniques!” Luo Tian recalled the legends of Zongdao Mountain as he pressed his hands against its surface.

“Hum…” A wave of invisible suction filled Luo Tian’s mind, and he felt as if his soul had left his body. He found himself in a gray space filled with white light points, where he saw Sun Kelnian and Tu Feiyang collecting the glowing fragments.

Chapter 1372: The Inheritance Mark

“These are all inheritances?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he grabbed a white light, which instantly imprinted a fragment into his mind.

“Need more!” Luo Tian gazed at the glowing points, understanding and joining the scramble for the inheritance marks.

“My mark! All mine!” Sun Kelnian chanted, his plump body agile as he snatched the marks with a greedy gaze.

“My luck surpasses yours!” Tu Feiyang waved his hands, his gray figure forming illusions as the inheritance marks gathered toward him.

“Not enough! I want all of it!” Tu Feiyang sneered, watching Luo Tian and Sun Kelnian’s speed. He then extended his gray fingers to sketch in the void.

“Hum…” The hums echoed from Tu Feiyang’s hands, and within moments, the inheritance marks surged toward him like meteors.

“You’re cheating!” Sun Kelnian roared, his face flushed with anger as the marks flew toward Tu Feiyang.

“You forced me!” Sun Kelnian bellowed, his hands moving as a white light formed into a pure-white basin. A terrifying suction emerged, creating an invisible vortex to battle Tu Feiyang for the marks.

“What!” Luo Tian gazed at their methods, stunned. He had not expected them to possess such techniques. Especially Sun Kelnian’s “Treasure Basin,” which seemed to attract the marks effortlessly, as if they flew toward him.

“Hmph! You think I’m someone you can outwit? I’ve roamed tombs since ten years old. Except for the mausoleums of Epoch Masters, I’ve seen everything! Even if your luck is sky-high, I have methods to make you suffer!” Sun Kelnian’s eyes gleamed with triumph.

“You bastard! How could you have this!” Tu Feiyang’s face darkened, watching the marks flee from him.

Luo Tian’s expression was equally shocked, seeing Sun Kelnian standing proudly, his confidence unshaken. He had not expected Sun Kelnian to possess so many tricks.

Yet soon, Luo Tian’s expression turned grim. Since entering, he had done nothing but watch. Though Tu Feiyang was also competing with Sun Kelnian, he still gained much.

“What should I do?” Luo Tian’s lips curled. He knew that relying on his speed alone would make him no match for them.

“Where did they get these techniques?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, pondering.

“Key!” Suddenly, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light. He recalled the one place where he had connected with the Master of Severing Heaven—his stone tablet that granted the Reincarnation Heaven Art.

“Let me try!” Luo Tian had no other ideas, so he sat in meditation, activating the Reincarnation Heaven Art.

“Giving up?” Sun Kelnian and Tu Feiyang smiled, seeing Luo Tian sit still.

Luo Tian was right; their techniques stemmed from the key they had obtained in Zongdao’s inheritance. But at this moment, they would not reveal their methods to Luo Tian.

“Better give up! This was meant for me!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes flashed coldly as he intensified his collection of marks, determined to secure them first.

“Mine!” Sun Kelnian panted, activating his Treasure Basin to absorb everything.

“Hum…” As they thought Luo Tian had given up, a hum resonated from his gray body.

“Ugh…” The stars in the gray space surged toward Luo Tian.

“Hundred… ten thousand…” A river of white light formed, swirling into a vortex that flew toward Luo Tian.

“What’s going on!” Sun Kelnian and Tu Feiyang were stunned, watching the marks rush toward Luo Tian, far surpassing their own.

“Damn it! I won’t let this happen!” Sun Kelnian roared, his voice filled with defiance. To lose the inheritance to Luo Tian was a fate he could not accept.

Tu Feiyang also fought desperately, gathering the white inheritance marks.

Yet their efforts were futile; even with increased speed, they lagged far behind Luo Tian.

Luo Tian reveled in the moment as he activated the Reincarnation Heaven Art, feeling fragments of knowledge flood his mind. The white lights continuously assembled within him, gradually forming completeness.

“Luo Tian, you bastard! Leave me some!” Sun Kelnian roared, watching the marks vanish.

“Hum…” But before Sun Kelnian’s words ended, the inheritance marks in the void vanished entirely, divided among the three.

“Bad luck! You’ve outwitted me again! I’ve only lost twice in my life, and both times it was to you!” Sun Kelnian gazed at the marks, preparing to fuse and refine them.

“Damn it! Why do I always get unlucky when I see you!” Tu Feiyang, recalling past memories, bore a grim face. The thought of his luck failing upon meeting Luo Tian made him wish to devour him alive, but he knew the priority was refining his marks.

“Hum…” Just as they began to refine, the gathered marks emitted a hum and trembled, breaking free from their control. They transformed into white stars, flying toward Luo Tian.

“I’ll fight you to the death!” Sun Kelnian’s eyes turned wild, watching his marks vanish again. He lunged toward Luo Tian with madness.

“You’re doomed!” Tu Feiyang’s face darkened, his gray body flying toward Luo Tian.

“Shatter!” Luo Tian opened his eyes slowly, a gray light radiating from them.

Though his voice was not loud, it felt like thunder in Sun Kelnian and Tu Feiyang’s minds. An invisible pressure pressed upon them, halting their movements in shock.

“What’s happening!” Sun Kelnian’s eyes flickered, sensing Luo Tian’s terrifying presence. He felt like a sovereign above all. His voice carried an odd resonance, making Sun Kelnian instinctively stand still, as if a mountain had fallen on his back.

Tu Feiyang was the same; he felt an irresistible will descend upon his soul, a complete crushing force he could not resist.

Both were stunned, gazing at Luo Tian seated in meditation, his lips slightly curled as he watched them.

“What did you do to us!” Tu Feiyang trembled, his helplessness and soul-shaking fear making him unwilling to accept this feeling.

“It’s the inheritance of the Master of Severing Heaven!” Sun Kelnian shouted, his voice filled with awe.

“You’re clever, Senior,” Luo Tian smiled lightly, his heart thrilled. He now understood the Master of Severing Heaven’s inheritance was truly extraordinary.

“Nine-generation Soul-Subduing Master!” Luo Tian recalled the voice in his mind, remembering the power of the Soul-Subduing Master.

“The Soul-Subduing Master cultivates the soul, subduing all souls—no matter if it’s an epoch-end soul, it will be suppressed before a Soul-Subduing Master!” Luo Tian recalled the inheritance’s description.

“Thief! You’re a thief!” Sun Kelnian glared with resentment, watching the inheritance marks surrounding Luo Tian.

“Luo Senior, at least give me a sip of soup!” Sun Kelnian shouted, gazing at Luo Tian. At this moment, he seemed like a master, leaving him no power to resist.

“Hmph… okay,” Luo Tian nodded gently, not finishing them off completely. He collected the marks he needed and returned a small portion to Sun Kelnian and Tu Feiyang.

“Ugh! Even flies have meat! I’ll endure!” Sun Kelnian’s voice carried sorrow as he absorbed the marks, which had shrunk significantly.

“Damn it!” Tu Feiyang’s face was grim. This time, like the previous Feather-Transcending Scripture, he had lost it to Luo Tian. This made him furious.

Yet despite his hatred for Luo Tian, as Sun Kelnian had said, this mark was better than nothing.

“Hum…” In an instant, both men completed their refinement and gazed at Luo Tian with envy.

“Zongdao’s Three Techniques!” Sun Kelnian sighed softly, sensing a martial art within the marks—Zongdao’s famed technique, Zongdao’s Palm.

Chapter 1373: The Soul-Subduing Master

“Zongdao’s Fist!” Tu Feiyang’s face darkened, having obtained Zongdao’s Fist, a formidable technique.

Zongdao’s Three Techniques—Zongdao’s Fist, Zongdao’s Palm, and Zongdao’s Seal. Though the first two were powerful, the third, Zongdao’s Seal, was the Master of Severing Heaven’s true strength, far surpassing the first two.

“Zongdao’s Seal!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, satisfied with another powerful technique.

But he knew Zongdao’s Seal was not the most precious; it was the Soul-Subduing Master’s inheritance. The Master of Severing Heaven had achieved epoch mastery due to this inheritance.

“Hum…” As the three pondered, a massive transmission force surged through their bodies, carrying them into the gray space.

Returning to their physical forms, Luo Tian smiled, his hands still touching Zongdao Mountain.

“Luo Tian, hand over the inheritance!” As soon as he returned to his body, Tu Feiyang’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. A powerful battle spirit spread across the mountain peak.

“Take it by force!” Luo Tian, hearing Tu Feiyang’s words, finally ignited a spark of anger. He leapt into action, his spear, the Splitting Heaven Spear, materializing in his hand.

“Luo Senior, I won’t fight you,” Sun Kelnian rubbed his hands, addressing Luo Tian. “We are both human, and you’ve done good for the Nine Domains. Share some of your inheritance with me and tell me where the Master of Severing Heaven’s epoch treasure is.”

“Boom…” A surge of blood energy erupted from Tu Feiyang’s body, his killing intent manifesting. His crimson head landed in his hand, and he leapt forward as a blood-red streak toward Luo Tian.

Tu Feiyang, now in the middle epoch, was far more formidable than before. His aura radiated invincibility, and within moments, he appeared before Luo Tian, his crimson head aiming for Luo Tian’s throat.

“Hum…” The Splitting Heaven Spear glowed with golden light, blocking the attack. The crimson head collided with it.

“Eight Directions Treasure-Stealing Art!” Luo Tian knew the Splitting Heaven Spear was only a pseudo-epoch treasure. Against Tu Feiyang’s crimson head, which could slay epoch-end masters, it could not withstand.

With the Eight Directions Treasure-Stealing Art’s support, the crimson head’s power diminished slightly. The spear barely held back.

Sparks erupted from their collision, and the spear’s body bore a bloodstain, bending with a resonant hum.

“Blood-Subjugation!” Tu Feiyang waved his hands, a torrent of blood energy erupting. The dense blood energy formed into multiple blood figures, resembling his clones. Their aura filled the sky as they attacked Luo Tian.

“Another technique!” Luo Tian observed the blood figures, his gaze serious.

As the first figure attacked, it lunged toward Luo Tian with a punch.

Luo Tian did not hesitate; he punched the figure, which exploded into blood energy, scattering around him.

“Second… third…” Each blood figure collided with Luo Tian, forcing him to retreat step by step. His body gradually became battered.

“Kill!” A cold voice echoed behind Luo Tian, sending a chill down his spine. He barely had time to dodge, choosing to minimize the damage.

“Pf!” Blood spurted from Luo Tian’s shoulder, and his body vanished instantly.

“Luo Tian? That’s all you’ve got?” Tu Feiyang sneered, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Use the Seven Steps of蛮神!” Tu Feiyang spoke softly, his fangs revealing a cold glint. “Without the Seven Steps of蛮神, you have no chance.”

“Then I’ll grant your wish!” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smile, ignoring the wound that showed no signs of healing.

“Seven Steps of蛮神: Crush Heaven!” Luo Tian sneered, unleashing his full power after ten years. His opponent was the enemy he had subdued a decade ago.

Though Luo Tian had not reached the middle epoch, his reincarnation immortal body contained an epoch’s worth of power.

Three reincarnation immortal bodies hummed within his dantian, and as he leapt into the sky, one step forward.

A golden foot, like a mountain, thundered down toward Tu Feiyang.

“First step: it won’t harm me!” Tu Feiyang sneered, facing the overwhelming foot. He formed a blood seal with his hands, which collided with the golden foot.

The thunderous collision shook the entire Zongdao Mountain, sending waves of energy. The broken structures below could not withstand it and turned to dust, floating in the sky.

“Seven Steps of蛮神: Shatter Stars!” Luo Tian took another step, his aura more terrifying. Sun Kelnian, observing from the sidelines, bore a serious expression.

“Use the fifth step! Otherwise, it’s useless! The level difference cannot be overturned by you!” Tu Feiyang mocked, his hands spread wide. A sea of blood surged forth, forming a blood-faced ghost that attacked the golden foot.

“Seven Steps of蛮神: Ghost-Subjugating!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, taking his third step.

“If that’s the case, I’ll send you off today!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes flashed coldly. He stood still, his body radiating an overwhelming aura. A sea of blood formed around him, eventually shaping into a lonely figure. The blood energy obscured its face, but Luo Tian felt an eerie familiarity—same as the Blood Master of the Endless Sea he had encountered in the Sea’s Edge.

The towering figure raised its hand, pointing toward Luo Tian with an overwhelming aura.

“By the name of Nine-generation Soul-Subduing Master, Three Lives of Soul-Subjugation!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows and pointed at the blood figure.

Sun Kelnian’s mouth gaped open, his eyes filled with shock as he watched Luo Tian.

In the sky, after Luo Tian’s point, the blood figure trembled violently. Then, his third step struck it, shattering it instantly.

“Cough… cough…” Tu Feiyang’s body appeared before Luo Tian and Sun Kelnian, battered.

“What happened? What just occurred!” Sun Kelnian’s mouth gaped open, his eyes filled with disbelief. He could not fathom what had transpired.

“Damn it!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes flashed with anger. In that moment, he did not know why his mind had been stunned, but it had directly affected him. Though brief, it had left him shaken.

“It’s the inheritance of the Master of Severing Heaven!” Tu Feiyang suddenly understood, recalling Luo Tian’s soul震慑 in Zongdao Mountain. It had completely crushed him.

Though weaker than in Zongdao Mountain, it had caught him off guard during his full attack, imprinting itself on his soul.

“Sneak attack! Next time I won’t let you succeed!” Tu Feiyang’s voice was cold, his body emitting a thunderous hum. The blood figure reformed slowly.

“Eight Directions Treasure-Stealing!” Luo Tian saw Tu Feiyang reforming the blood figure. He waved his hand, and countless lights flashed around him.

Treasures appeared around Luo Tian, radiating immense power. Several pseudo-epoch treasures glowed with terrifying might.
