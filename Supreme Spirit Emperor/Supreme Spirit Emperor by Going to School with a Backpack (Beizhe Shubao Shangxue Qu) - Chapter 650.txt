His three companions' eyes also gleamed with excitement as they launched their martial techniques toward Luo Tian. Three more attacks surged forward. Luo Tian's expression slightly shifted; he was currently standing on a sword blade, which had clearly been enhanced by some mysterious force. Even he could not break through it. If he faced the four of them, he would either be severely wounded or pierced like a hedgehog.

"Damn it!" Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo's faces darkened as they watched the four attacks close in on Luo Tian. They rushed toward the platform.

"Buzz..." Dragon Spring erupted, its black blade slicing a resounding slash of light. It clashed with the golden mountain.

The thunderous echoes reverberated through space, and the golden mountain was instantly shattered by Luo Tian's strike. Divine laws flowed around his body, but his feet sank slightly deeper into the blade, and blood gushed forth again.

As Luo Tian barely repelled the golden mountain, the remaining three attacks instantly reached his front, making his face grim. Still, he swung his fist to meet them.

"Boom... Boom..." The deep and distant sound echoed through the space, a violent fluctuation concealing Luo Tian's form and even his aura. At the same time, Yin Yitian reached the platform, drawing the attention of the Xuanshan Four Elders.

"Let us destroy Luo Tian together. Hand over the Ghost Valley Seal to us, then combine our strength to break through this barrier. How about giving you the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King?" The eldest among the Xuanshan Four Elders looked at Yin Yitian, exchanging rapid words.

To them, offering the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King to Yin Yitian was already a great favor. Moreover, it depended on whether they would accept it; their current goal was merely to keep Yin Yitian under control.

Yin Yitian's face bore a faint smile as he stepped closer to the eldest of the Xuanshan Four Elders. "I don't want the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King!"

"Ha! Yin Xiong, what do you mean? We Xuanshan Four Elders have walked the upper three heavens for years; we would never break our word!" The elder with a scar on his forehead spoke, his voice carrying sincerity.

"I said I don't want it, and I truly don't. However, I demand one thing from you. Hope you can grant it to me!" Yin Yitian replied, his gaze fixed on the Xuanshan Four Elders.

At that moment, Tang Xinghuo had also reached them but was ignored by the elders. Meanwhile, Luo Tian appeared, though his condition was dire—his feet were embedded in the blade, and several long swords before him bore bloodstains. Evidently, Luo Tian had not been idle but had retreated.

"Yin Xiong, what do you desire? Just say it!" When Yin Yitian's words reached Elder Xuanshan, his eyes flickered with excitement. Though they had some valuable items, none compared to the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King or Ghost Valley.

"Your life!" Before Elder Xuanshan could react, Yin Yitian surged forward, his hand transforming into a blade that slashed toward Elder Xuanshan.

"Kill..." Tang Xinghuo, long overlooked by the group, suddenly unleashed a finger strike.

They had secretly planned this ambush; without it, they would have no chance of survival. They could not allow the Xuanshan Four Elders to continue attacking Luo Tian.

Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo's speed was astonishing, leaving no time for anyone to react.

Chapter 2440: Sword Slaying the World

The Xuanshan Four Elders never expected Yin Yitian, who had previously smiled and nodded, to turn on them so quickly. By the time they realized it, Yin Yitian's blade had already struck Elder Xuanshan's chest.

"You..." Elder Xuanshan's face darkened instantly, but he was no ordinary cultivator; his body quickly covered with a layer of golden stone armor.

"Crack..." Yin Yitian's blade struck the armor, sending Elder Xuanshan staggering back with blood spewing from his ribs.

Meanwhile, Tang Xinghuo's green hand shot forward and pierced Elder Xuanshan's forehead, instantly killing him.

"Thud..." Elder Xuanshan's body collapsed to the ground, his eyes vacant as life vanished.

"Die!" Elder Xuanshan's and Elder Xuanshan's faces turned fierce, their bodies radiating immense power as they attacked Tang Xinghuo.

Elder Xuanshan also recoiled, his fists radiating terrifying power as he hurled them toward Yin Yitian.

"Overconfident!" Yin Yitian's expression was contemptuous; even Elder Xuanshan in his prime did not intimidate him. Now, with Elder Xuanshan wounded, he was even less of a threat.

Yin Yitian's blade clashed with Elder Xuanshan's fists, the sound of their collision echoing through space.

"Treacherous and vicious! The Elder of Killing Lives, truly deserving of his name!" Elder Xuanshan regretted his decision to ally with Yin Yitian. If he had attacked Luo Tian immediately, there would have been no such trouble. Now, they three were at a disadvantage; their two brothers fared better, but he had endured Yin Yitian's full-force strike and was in a dire state. He knew he could not match Yin Yitian now.

Luo Tian panted, watching Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo. He silently marveled at how correct it was to subdue them.

"His feet are pierced!" Luo Tian muttered, but he still took a step forward toward the black-and-white platform.

Bloodstained swords surrounded him; Luo Tian's legs had lost all sensation, and he felt no longer like a disciple of the Heaven's Path Sect. The identity of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King's heir brought him no benefit, only a sense of bad luck.

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian finally reached the black-and-white platform. His feet were unrecognizable, and upon arriving, he sat down, gazing at his mangled feet. His lips twitched as he quickly retrieved a pill to recover.

"Yin Yitian, this kid is yours. Now is the best time to kill him. We won't compete for the Ghost Valley Seal; give us the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King!" Elder Xuanshan spoke, still fighting against Yin Yitian's blows while spitting blood.

Meanwhile, Tang Xinghuo was struggling; Elder Xuanshan's and Elder Xuanshan's attacks were ruthless, their unity making Tang Xinghuo barely hold his ground.

"These two together are stronger than a normal Immortal King at the initial stage. If the Xuanshan Four Elders combined, they were said to have a joint technique that could match an Immortal King at the late stage for several seconds. Fortunately, I managed to ambush one!" Tang Xinghuo inwardly sighed; if he hadn't succeeded in the ambush, he might already be a corpse.

Immortal King cultivators' recovery was extremely fast. Though Luo Tian wasn't recognized by Heaven's Path and couldn't recover through divine energy, his body was unusually resilient, and with the pills, his wounds healed quickly.

Time passed slowly; an hour had elapsed when Tang Xinghuo finally couldn't hold on, his body riddled with wounds and bloodied as he roared, green flames swirling around him.

"Die!" Elder Xuanshan shouted, his voice filled with anger. If it weren't for this insignificant Tang Xinghuo's ambush on one of their sworn brothers, even with Yin Yitian, they would have subdued him by now.

Elder Xuanshan and Elder Xuanshan interlocked their hands, summoning a sky-piercing sword between them. With four hands gripping it, the massive blade descended with immense power, making Tang Xinghuo tremble.

"Master, you're not done yet? I can't hold on any longer! This attack is too much for me!" Tang Xinghuo shouted, his gaze turning to Luo Tian who had just risen.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian stepped with the Yellow Spring Step, instantly appearing before Tang Xinghuo. His black sword blocked above his head.

"Crack..." Thunder echoed overhead, but the powerful blade energy wasn't dispersed; it was merely deflected.

Luo Tian's face darkened as his foot wounds reopened, blood gushing from beneath him.

"Strong combined attack, but not enough!" Luo Tian chuckled, then took a step forward, leaving crimson footprints on the ground. His form was lightning-fast, his eyes flashing with killing intent as he charged toward them.

Luo Tian reached the platform and saw Zhang Ziping's condition: he was seated, with a patch of dried blood beneath him. His wounds were countless, his chest caved in. Luo Tian could imagine that if he had arrived even a moment later, Zhang Ziping would have been doomed without the Xuanshan Four Elders' distraction.

An Immortal King at the initial stage was truly no problem for Luo Tian now, though he couldn't crush a half-step Immortal King as easily. But defeating two Immortal Kings at the initial stage, he was confident he could manage it.

Luo Tian's speed was extraordinary; his subterranean technique combined with the Yellow Spring Step allowed him to outpace all Immortal Kings at the initial stage. In an instant, he reached one of the attackers and slashed down.

His black sword directly struck Elder Xuanshan, who hadn't even reacted before the blade was at his head.

"Spurt..." Blood splattered, and Elder Xuanshan's body was instantly split in two. The scene was extremely bloody, causing everyone to pause momentarily.

"Old Third!" Elder Xuanshan and Elder Xuanshan roared, stunned by Luo Tian's strength.

"Did you enjoy being smashed before?" Luo Tian smirked, his form like lightning as he vanished from the spot.

The black sword, like a dragon, struck! The head fell!

Elder Xuanshan's face still bore shock; his hands were frozen in the gesture of forming a seal against Tang Xinghuo. He was instantly beheaded by the black sword.

"So... so strong..." Tang Xinghuo's eyes were filled with fear, for the first time feeling a sense of awe toward Luo Tian.

At the same time, Tang Xinghuo was also grateful; he was glad to have survived under Luo Tian's hand.

"I like this personality!" Yin Yitian smiled, watching Luo Tian; he appreciated Luo Tian's decisive and ruthless nature.

As he spoke, Yin Yitian roared, his blade's radiance expanding like the beginning of creation. It struck Elder Xuanshan, who was already wounded.

Blood mist rose again as Elder Xuanshan was eliminated by Yin Yitian. The renowned Xuanshan Four Elders, once famed in the upper three heavens, were now completely annihilated within the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King.

"Master is truly invincible at his level!" Tang Xinghuo praised enthusiastically, this time genuinely looking up to Luo Tian with reverence.

"Master, what about the one inside? Should we deal with him? With your divine power, I'm sure a single strike would break through this barrier!" Tang Xinghuo praised for a while, then his gaze turned to Zhang Ziping seated there.

"That's my elder brother. How do you plan to deal with him?" Luo Tian smirked, knowing Tang Xinghuo wasn't intentional. A faint smile appeared on his face.

"Uh..." Tang Xinghuo was instantly speechless by Luo Tian's words, his eyes filled with embarrassment. He said nothing further. Yin Yitian looked at Tang Xinghuo with disdain, waiting for Luo Tian's orders.

"I'll go in!" Luo Tian spoke to the two, stepping toward the barrier while activating his subterranean technique.

"Buzz..." Under the astonished gazes of Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, Luo Tian passed through the barrier that had kept the Xuanshan Four Elders out.

As soon as he entered the barrier, the surrounding scenery changed again. A figure stood there, his eyes filled with confusion—Zhang Ziping.

Before Zhang Ziping were three mountains standing tall, each resembling a sharp sword and radiating an overwhelming aura that made one's heart tremble.

"Little Tian?" Seeing Luo Tian, Zhang Ziping's eyes lit up with joy; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to be able to enter.

"Senior Brother, how did you end up here?" Luo Tian asked as he approached Zhang Ziping.

"I was worried about you, so I came in. Come on, I was bored here alone. This is a cultivation inheritance; only those who hold the Heaven's Path Thunder Sword can enter."

"This three swords are left by the Fallen Heaven Immortal King. They each contain a sword technique!" Zhang Ziping spoke, his voice filled with excitement; he had already spent time understanding them.

Luo Tian felt touched, his gaze turning to the three swords. He approached the one Zhang Ziping was at.

As Luo Tian's eyes met the sword, his expression slightly shifted; he seemed to see a resounding blade of light sweeping across eight directions.

"Single Sword Against the Immortals!" Luo Tian exclaimed, this sword technique was one he knew well—his killer锏.

Luo Tian hadn't expected to find the method for "Single Sword Against the Immortals" here.

"Senior Brother, this is 'Single Sword Against the Immortals'; you should do it like this!" Luo Tian spoke, explaining his mastery of "Single Sword Against the Immortals" to Zhang Ziping.

"Hmm!" Zhang Ziping's eyes brightened; he was naturally a sword master, with his own insights into sword techniques. Thus, he grasped it quickly.

"Second form?" Luo Tian didn't disturb Zhang Ziping from practicing "Single Sword Against the Immortals" but turned his gaze to the second mountain, a sense of anticipation in his heart.

"Sword Slaying the World!" A solemn voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, and as it resonated, he felt himself immersed in a world of swords.

Chapter 2441: The Valley of Ten Thousand Snakes

Three sword mountains stood there, and Luo Tian stood on the second one, his eyes filled with joy as a solemn voice echoed in his mind.

"The Three Sword Techniques of Heaven are the three martial arts I cultivated with my entire life. 'Single Sword Against the Immortals' is the first of these three, created when I was ten thousand years old. This second form, 'Sword Slaying the World,' was created when I was twenty thousand years old!"

"Sword Slaying the World' emphasizes ruthlessness—ruthless toward enemies, even more so toward oneself. 'Single Sword Against the Immortals' is already a formidable technique, but this one was created based on it. Thus, its power surpasses that of 'Single Sword Against the Immortals'!"

"This technique requires a fearless spirit, to annihilate all under heaven. It is more suited for mass attacks; once unleashed, it sweeps across the eight directions of the world. However, the cost is immense—only a hundred years of life can be used to unleash it. Once unleashed, an Immortal King at the middle stage would be drained instantly! Remember!"

"Activate the Lesser Confluence Point... traverse the lesser meridians..." The solemn voice continued, and the method of activating this second form echoed in Luo Tian's mind, pouring into his consciousness.

"Terrifyingly strong! This is clearly several 'Single Sword Against the Immortals' combined!" Luo Tian was awestruck by the second form's power.

"Difficult..." However, his face soon showed a bitter smile; this technique was truly arduous. A single 'Single Sword Against the Immortals' had already drained much of his cultivation, and this second form was too challenging for him at the moment.

Not only did it demand high cultivation, but also mastery of the sword; one had to reach the fourth level of sword art.

"To master these three sword techniques, you must enter the next inheritance? This is no trap!" But then, Luo Tian's face showed a bitter smile.

This second form required mastery, and with his current understanding, it would take over ten years. Moreover, he hadn't reached the fourth level of sword art. Most importantly, Zhang Daotian couldn't wait; thus, Luo Tian chose to leave.

"How do I exit?" Luo Tian didn't even glance at the third mountain, for he had his own plan: to leave Zhang Ziping here and go out himself. If Zhang Ziping mastered it, he would too.

"Little Tian, aren't you going to stay and cultivate?" Zhang Ziping noticed Luo Tian's intention to leave and frowned slightly.

"I have other matters; I can't stay here for long!" Luo Tian replied gently, not telling Zhang Ziping about Zhang Daotian. If he had, his previous efforts would have been in vain.

"Okay, I'll stay and accept the inheritance. You go first, but be careful!" Zhang Ziping spoke to Luo Tian, knowing that Luo Tian was no longer the small disciple under his protection but a formidable strength.

"Then, Senior Brother, you study well! Teach me when you're done!" Luo Tian laughed and walked out of the barrier, but in his mind he added: "If I can learn it!"

"Strength is the most important thing!" Zhang Ziping watched Luo Tian leave, his eyes filled with admiration. He knew Luo Tian was hiding something from him; he could sense that Luo Tian's condition wasn't right.

"Crack..." At the same time, Zhang Ziping's body emitted a series of cracking sounds. His back flashed with sword energy; a white wing appeared on his back.

"Boom..." Zhang Ziping reached out and pulled the wing off, blood gushing from his back. The white wing transformed into a ball and landed in Zhang Ziping's hand, which he then waved toward the barrier.

Luo Tian stepped out of the barrier and saw Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, both looking expectantly.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian just exited the barrier, a white light flew out of it and landed before him.

"Another half of the Demon Cloud Wings?" Luo Tian grabbed the white ball in his hand, his body trembling slightly.

"Buzz..." As he caught the white ball, a transmission force acted on all three of them, as if repelling them, sending the trio away from this platform.

A vortex appeared in the淡 blue sky, and the three of them fell down, instantly crushed by a massive force, collapsing several trees and crashing into the ground.

Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian were stunned, their gazes scanning the surroundings—dense forest.

"Did we exit from the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King?" Tang Xinghuo asked, his voice filled with annoyance.

"Yes, we did. Inside, only your master's elder brother remains..." Yin Yitian sighed deeply; they hadn't gained much from the Fallen Heaven Immortal King's inheritance.

"The road ahead is long; don't worry, I won't betray you!" Luo Tian spoke, his heart very happy. Zhang Ziping was more suitable than himself to be the disciple of the Heaven's Path Sect.

"What now? Do you want to leave or continue?" Luo Tian asked Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, hoping they would leave.

"Don't go! No matter what, we won't!" Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian shook their heads immediately. Entering the Immortal Mountain was a death trap; what they gained didn't match their sacrifice, and they were very dissatisfied.

"The Immortal Mountain holds countless opportunities; the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King is just one of them!"

"Moreover, you can't leave!" Yin Yitian spoke softly, looking at the surroundings. They had never seen this before.

"To leave the Immortal Mountain, you must rely on luck!" Yin Yitian said; many strong cultivators had entered the Immortal Mountain but none had ever left.

"Hmm, yes!" Luo Tian nodded, his gaze now scanning the surroundings. A forest stretched endlessly; it echoed with deathly silence, like the first forest Luo Tian had landed in. However, this one no longer drained their lifespan, allowing them to breathe a sigh of relief.

"Rest for a while!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes showing a faint smile; his feet hadn't healed yet.

Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo naturally wouldn't object; they had also been wounded in their battle with the Xuanshan Four Elders, and their tense nerves needed to relax.

Luo Tian swallowed the white ball, and a painful sensation returned to his back; one black and one white wing appeared on his back, radiating powerful energy.

"This is the complete Demon Cloud Wings!" Luo Tian muttered internally, feeling that each flap of his wings would be earth-shattering.

"There are also eyes! Use the wind-sounding beast's eyes to refine my Purple Extreme Demon Eyes. I wonder what effect it would have!" Luo Tian waved his hand, taking out the two green eyes. Even though the wind-sounding beast had been dead for a long time, its emerald eyes still glowed with cold light.

"It's not the right time to refine!" Luo Tian dismissed the thought, storing the two eyes and beginning to sit in meditation to recover.

After three hours, they adjusted their conditions to the best state and stood up, walking through the forest.

"There's a path!" As they walked, they discovered a small path covered with weeds; even some fresh footprints were there.

"Does someone live in the Immortal Mountain?" Tang Xinghuo's eyes showed disbelief.

"Maybe it's a strong cultivator who got lost!" Yin Yitian spoke, his tone serious.

"Better to be cautious!" Luo Tian frowned slightly; regardless, they decided to take the path. If they met others, they might gain some insights—after all, they knew nothing about the Immortal Mountain.

They walked for an hour along the path without any signs, but they encountered a few living creatures, causing them to sigh in relief. At least it was normal now.

"Hiss..." As they walked, a green light flashed and rushed toward Luo Tian's group.

As they were Immortal Kings, the moment the green light appeared, Luo Tian and his companions formed a domain. Luo Tian grabbed it with his hand, and a small green snake appeared in his palm.

"If not for being an Immortal King, you might have been tricked!" Luo Tian spoke softly; the small green snake was not large, but he had no doubt that its cold fangs could strip a True Immortal King of layers of skin.

"Hisss..." The green snake continuously extended its tongue, its eyes looking at Luo Tian.

"Let you go; next time, don't provoke someone you can't handle!" Luo Tian waved his hand and threw the green snake away. They continued walking, but the green snake fell to the ground, its mottled eyes showing a human-like expression as it slithered toward them.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian felt the green snake approaching their path, blocking it with a puzzled expression.

"Hisss..." The snake's tongue extended repeatedly, emitting strange sounds that made Luo Tian smile slightly; he couldn't understand what it was saying.

Luo Tian didn't pay much attention and continued walking with Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo along the path. However, as time passed, they noticed something was off; creatures were increasing along the way, but all of them were snakes.

Colorful snakes appeared one after another; their eyes glowed with cold light, as if wary of Luo Tian's strength but still fierce.

"Be careful; something's wrong!" Luo Tian warned Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, being more cautious.

"Who are you? Why have you come to my Valley of Ten Thousand Snakes?" Just as Luo Tian's words finished, a cold female voice echoed in their ears.

Chapter 2442: Shatter ()

The cold female voice echoed in their ears, and as they were surprised, a golden giant snake slithered from the forest toward them. It transformed into a girl's form before Luo Tian and his companions.

Yellow clothes, a slender figure with an exceptionally soft waist, making one glance at it twice. Golden eyes gazed at Luo Tian and his companions with caution. The girl's cultivation was at the half-step Immortal King level.

"Hisss..." As the girl's words finished, a series of colorful long snakes slithered from behind her, making people's skin crawl.

"Miss, we didn't mean to offend; we're just lost in the Immortal Mountain!" Luo Tian quickly spoke, addressing the girl.

"Are you an Immortal King?" The girl's eyes flickered with excitement, golden light rising within them.

"Human? We haven't seen humans in the Valley of Ten Thousand Snakes for a long time!" The girl's words hadn't finished when several figures burst through the air, appearing in Luo Tian's view.

Several figures with different attire but formidable power made Luo Tian and his companions' faces turn serious immediately.

"Capture them for me; let's sacrifice them to the Queen, so she can awaken sooner!" The yellow-clad girl coldly spoke, pointing at Luo Tian and his companions.

"Yes!" Those strong cultivators behind the girl shouted, immediately surrounding Luo Tian and his companions without hesitation.

"Hisss..." A series of long snakes also surrounded Luo Tian and his companions tightly, layer after layer, making people's skin crawl.

"Unexpectedly, there are such races in the Immortal Mountain!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration as he pulled out Dragon Spring and gazed at the surrounding strong cultivators.

"We truly are just passing through here and don't wish to make enemies with your clan. Please move aside!" Luo Tian didn't want to cause too much trouble, addressing the snake clan members.

"It's too late; we've finally seen humans! How could we let you go so easily!" The yellow-clad girl's face showed disdain, a cold smile. Her fangs protruded, emitting a faint glow that didn't match her appearance.

"One Immortal King in the middle, four at the initial stage; I'll take the one in the middle, and you deal with the others!" Luo Tian addressed Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo.

"No problem, but be careful!" Yin Yitian warned Luo Tian, his golden long sword suddenly slashing. A series of snakes rushing toward them were instantly cut down in large numbers.

"Try not to kill them; I feel this snake clan isn't simple!" Luo Tian warned, these people had emerged as middle-stage Immortal Kings; obviously, they weren't the strongest. Perhaps there were even late-stage Immortal Kings behind them.

This was the Immortal Mountain; if the snake clan could survive here, it meant there were peak-stage Immortal Kings. Luo Tian believed in that.

"Hisss..." As they spoke, a series of snakes launched another attack without any gaps or hesitation.

"Kill!" The few Immortal Kings also moved, roaring and rushing toward Luo Tian's group.

Luo Tian swung his sword, instantly cutting down several snakes and striking a middle-stage Immortal King.

"Spurt..." Blood splattered, and the strong cultivator was instantly stopped by Luo Tian's strike.

Luo Tian blocked one strong cultivator, then his feet rose with a gust of wind and rushed toward another.

Luo Tian's speed was extremely fast, and the strong cultivator saw him vanish in an instant. His sword struck the strong cultivator's chest.

"Crack..." A clear sound echoed, and the strong cultivator was also thrown back by Luo Tian's strike. In a moment, he had wounded two initial-stage Immortal Kings, leaving the yellow-clad girl stunned.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's speed was fast, but four initial-stage Immortal Kings could still react. Two more rushed forward with a yellow mountain crushing down on Luo Tian.

At the same time, a green net descended over Luo Tian, corroding heaven and earth, obviously carrying poison.

Luo Tian remained calm, his hands moving as the flame mark on his forehead erupted with nine-color flames. They swept across the eight directions, rushing toward the green net.

"Crack..." A clear sound echoed as stones shattered; six punches struck the yellow mountain, which instantly crumbled.

"Die!" Luo Tian had just blocked two attacks when the two he had wounded regained their senses. Though they were injured, they weren't fatal and still had one more fight left.

A colorful giant snake appeared, its massive tail sweeping toward Luo Tian with a loud sound.

"Formation!" Luo Tian's hands moved, his body roaring as it grew.

"World..." Divine laws flowed; in an instant, Luo Tian's body expanded to a thousand zhang. He reached out with his hand and grabbed the thick tail.

"Boom..." A deep sound echoed, and Luo Tian's hand grasped the snake's tail. His massive body took two steps back.

As Luo Tian grabbed the tail, a golden hand suddenly extended and grasped him.

Actually, it wasn't just one hand; it was a golden long snake wrapped around Luo Tian's body.

"Crack..." Sounds echoed on Luo Tian's body, and he felt a massive force pressing against him. His breath became short.

"Are you really trying to kill me? I've said I have no ill intent! You're forcing me!" Luo Tian roared, his voice echoing through the heavens.

"Even if you want to kill me, what can you do!" Three initial-stage Immortal Kings controlled the illusionary hand and shouted.

"Then don't blame me for opening fire!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his body emitting thunderous sounds. His demon energy surged as he began to break free from the snake wrapped around him.

"It's useless; we three have combined our strength. How can you break free? The more you struggle, the tighter it gets!" One initial-stage Immortal King laughed.

Divine laws flowed; the snake slithered around Luo Tian's body, trying to strangle him.

"Demon Cloud Wings!" Luo Tian roared, and a fluctuation arose from his back; black and white wings appeared on his back.

"Kid, let go of me!" The giant snake Luo Tian had grabbed roared continuously; even though he was wrapped, he didn't let go. He felt as if pressed by a massive force, no matter how he struggled, he couldn't escape Luo Tian's grip.

As the black and white wings appeared, a storm arose from Luo Tian's back, emitting sharp energy.

"Open!" Luo Tian roared, his entire body exerting strength; the black and white wings also began to strike repeatedly.

"Crack... Crack..." In an instant, thunderous sounds echoed; a violent windstorm surrounded Luo Tian. The snakes wrapped around him disintegrated before his eyes, and the black and white wings spread out.

"Now it's my turn!" Luo Tian's face showed a cold smile as he swung the giant snake he had grabbed.

"Buzz..." The massive body of the snake broke through space, and Luo Tian swung it toward the three.

The three's faces darkened; Luo Tian was using their companions to attack them. Even if they blocked it, their companions would be severely injured.

"Boom... Boom..." As the three were stunned, the snake's body struck them, instantly sending them flying.

"Again!" Luo Tian laughed and sent them flying again without giving them a chance to recover, continuously swinging the snake toward them.

Meanwhile, Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo were attacking the middle-stage Immortal King, temporarily gaining the upper hand.

"Is this person a monster?" The yellow-clad girl's eyes showed shock, watching Luo Tian swing the snake.

"Run..." Finally, the three attacked by Luo Tian couldn't hold on and flew away.

"What are you running for?" Luo Tian took a step forward, his Demon Cloud Wings vibrating and sending out a violent windstorm.

"Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed, the storm sweeping through and annihilating a large area of forest. Luo Tian's face still showed a smile as he felt a massive force pushing him away.

"Damn..." Luo Tian's face slightly shifted, and he let out a startled cry before his massive body vanished.

His enormous body collided with space, and in an instant, he caught up with the three who had fled.

"What speed!" The three elders' hearts trembled; they hadn't expected Luo Tian to catch up so quickly.

"Move aside!" Luo Tian cursed, his body uncontrollable as it collided with the three.

The three elders instantly felt a strong sense of danger; two elders suddenly shifted and dodged Luo Tian's trajectory. However, one didn't react in time and was directly hit by Luo Tian's high-speed body.

"Boom..." Blood splattered; under the shocked gaze of the other two elders, their companion was instantly turned into blood mist and shattered.

"Trouble..." Luo Tian muttered internally; he hadn't intended to kill them, but he hadn't expected the Demon Cloud Wings' power to be so strong. This was his first time using it without control, and the force still pushed him forward.

That massive force continued to push Luo Tian, carrying him as a streak of light through space and vanishing from the spot.

"Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds continued to echo; the yellow-clad girl watched the earth torn apart by Luo Tian, her body trembling.

"He's heading toward the Valley of Ten Thousand Snakes! Don't let him interfere with the Queen!" One elder spoke, suddenly realizing something.

"Damn human!" The middle-stage Immortal King fighting against Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo also looked grim, no longer focused on the fight. His body shifted into a golden long snake and chased after Luo Tian's direction.

Chapter 2443: Green ()

In the Immortal Mountain, a high mountain stood there, its entire form resembling a long dragon. And...
