In the boundless starry expanse of the Demon Domain, Luo Tian's golden array banners radiated brilliant light. At the same time, countless golden array banners emerged from the surrounding stars, encircling everyone present. Only those previously repelled by Luo Tian remained outside the banners.

"One... a hundred..." Each array banner illuminated the entire starry sky like flickering stars, totaling ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine banners. This sealed all escape routes.

"Come on, I'd like to see what your secret weapon is, having gathered so many people," a senior sage from the Mingyu Domain said with an aged expression, his eyes filled with deep interest as he awaited Luo Tian's move.

"Thunderous rumbling..." A rolling thunder echoed, oppressive atmosphere making it hard to breathe. The sky darkened as if plunging into chaos, gray energy swirling beneath the stars.

"Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment!" Luo Tian struck a series of golden talismans, spreading them outward to fully activate the great array.

"Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment? This sounds familiar," a senior sage from the Divine and Demon Clans mused, his expression thoughtful.

"Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment!" The two murmured, their faces turning pale as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Damn it..." Even after countless years of existence, the two elders' souls trembled in fear. Suddenly recalling where they'd heard of the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array.

"Quick, flee! This kid's mad! It's the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array of the legendary Wàn Chóngwǔ, a saintly peak would be annihilated by it!" One elder rushed toward the array's perimeter.

"What?" Upon hearing this, people's faces changed. Their expressions turned terrified as they tried to flee but were too late.

"Crack!" Lightning struck repeatedly, each golden bolt carrying heavenly Dao power, striking down upon them.

In an instant, the entire array was engulfed in lightning punishment. Each bolt was terrifying; even a saintly beginner wouldn't survive an hour, inevitably perishing.

Luo Tian stood within the array, a smile on his face as he watched the chaos. His lips curled slightly as lightning struck him, sending white smoke rising from his body.

"This array harnesses heavenly power, summoning Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment. Each person must endure their own heavenly trial! With so many of us, the trials will be terrifying!" A divine and demon clan elder suffered agonizingly, his body convulsing from the lightning punishment. As a saintly late-stage powerhouse, he received special attention.

Soon people's faces showed terror as they gazed at the saintly peak powerhouse from Mingyu. Here was a saintly peak, and beyond that lay the Epoch Realm. Did this mean they'd have to accompany the elder through an Epoch Realm trial?

"Damn it, Luo Tian, are you insane? Do you want to take us all down with you!" People cried out in agony.

"Thunderous rumbling..." Thunder roared again, multicolored lightning descending from the sky. The array transformed into a colorful ocean. Everyone howled, no longer cursing Luo Tian as the lightning had escalated to annihilate saintly mid-stage.

Several sects' disciples struggled, their faces pale. After all, they were only saintly beginners. The trial of a mid-stage saint was already overwhelming for them.

"Boom..." A bell rang, the Epoch Bell lifted Luo Tian. With a smile, he stood at the center of the lightning sea, gazing at everyone.

"Everyone, enjoy yourselves. I'll leave first!" Luo Tian smiled, retrieving a array disc. Having already planned everything, how could he lack preparation? He extended his hand, golden saintly power drawing a talisman into the disc.

A humming sound echoed. In an instant, Luo Tian and the Epoch Bell appeared outside the array.

"Damn it, Luo Tian, you're not human! Ah..." Curses echoed as people still struggling against the trial saw Luo Tian outside the array, their faces nearly bleeding.

"Wow, truly strong! He's still alive!" Luo Tian smiled as he gazed at the Mingyu elder who remained unshaken within the array, and the several late-stage saintly elders colliding with the array.

"Boom..." The collision sounds continued, heavenly Dao energy radiating. Golden eyes slowly brightened, their gaze as tangible as reality, making people's minds tremble with fear.

"Buzz..." A golden humanoid lightning form gradually appeared. Seven-color light flowed around the figure, adding a divine aura. Compared to the golden humanoid lightning that once protected Sun Mengru, this was stronger, capable of annihilating late-stage saints.

Numerous humanoid lightning forms rushed toward the array's people, causing disciples and mid-stage saintly individuals to panic.

"Boom..." Finally, a late-stage disciple was turned into a wisp of smoke, vanishing from sight.

"A disciple has fallen!" People's faces showed shock. This was just the beginning, and the remaining disciples struggled to endure, only one disciple using a false Epoch Treasure to barely withstand the trial capable of annihilating late-stage saints.

"Boom..." The three蝎子 (scorpion) figures' faces were grim. A light screen on their ancient war chariot blocked the humanoid lightning outside, but the barrier was riddled with cracks, about to shatter.

The four from Shroul Domain had pale faces. The entire void was sealed, leaving no escape. They relied on their skills to evade the humanoid lightning, but being caught was just a matter of time.

Other late-stage saints began to fight desperately. They knew only by breaking the array could they have a chance of survival. If this continued, summoning heavenly trials capable of annihilating saintly peaks would leave them no escape.

Thus, while defending against the humanoid lightning, they合力 (combined forces) attacked the resilient barrier.

"Crack!" Under their combined efforts, the array actually developed tiny cracks, making them happy.

"Luo Tian, once I escape, I'll never give you another chance to trick me. I'll make you kneel before me!" A late-stage demon clan powerhouse's face showed madness, his shoulder pierced by the humanoid lightning, blood splattering.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly as he gazed at the tiny crack on the array, a bad premonition forming in his heart.

"Damn it, Wàn Língkōng's kid isn't reliable!" Luo Tian's lips twitched. If these people truly broke the array, he'd have no escape.

"Sorry, but your death is more important!" Luo Tian slowly removed his back's Shāngtiān Bow (Harming Heaven Bow), drawing the bowstring. Golden arrow feathers transformed into a streak of light, instantly appearing before the demon clan elder.

The elder was already struggling to defend against the humanoid lightning. How could he withstand Luo Tian's Harming Heaven Bow arrow?

"Boom..." The golden long arrow pierced the elder's body. In an instant, it transformed into a mass of blood mist, slowly gathering together. Before it could fully form, the humanoid lightning completely annihilated it within the array.

"Ahh..." The remaining three late-stage elders showed madness, desperately attacking the array as they felt the terrifying energy from above. They couldn't withstand it.

"Crack!" The array cracked again, making Luo Tian's heart jump. He no longer held back, shooting another golden arrow into the array, piercing the divine clan elder's body.

"Crack... crack..." Two consecutive shots. Two golden streaks flew from Luo Tian's hands, one after another, piercing the last two late-stage elders, ultimately annihilated by heavenly trials.

People watched as five late-stage elders were reduced to wisps of smoke, vanishing completely.

"Those were late-stage elders! Did they really die so easily?" People's faces showed terror, gazing at the array where only four mid-stage Shroul Domain elders and three scorpion figures were desperately supporting.

As the late-stage elders were annihilated, several lightning forms lost their targets, shifting focus to the remaining people, causing them great suffering.

"Crack!" The light screen on the ancient war chariot shattered. Several lightning forms instantly struck the three scorpion leaders.

Without the protection of the ancient war chariot, the three were only mid-stage saints. How could they withstand the humanoid lightning capable of annihilating late-stage saints? In an instant, they were blasted into fragments, completely destroyed.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at the Mingyu elder seated calmly, unshaken by all. He hadn't even moved despite the scorpion three's demise.

"Boom... boom..." Four sounds of destruction echoed. The four Shroul Domain figures finally couldn't endure, being caught by the humanoid lightning and vanishing from sight.

At this point, only the Mingyu Domain's saintly peak elder remained within the array, and a disciple who had been using a false Epoch Treasure to barely withstand it. It was unclear which sect he belonged to.

"Luo Tian, we are enemies!" The disciple's face was pale. He held a golden great cauldron on his head, spewing endless light to protect the youth.

"Buzz..." A fluctuation spread. He must have used some method, as the young disciple vanished beneath the cauldron, leaving behind a false Epoch Treasure cauldron within the array, making people's eyes envious.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian slowly gathered black magic arrows in his hands, his body enveloped in dark qi. He aimed the arrow tip at the Mingyu Domain's saintly peak elder.

Chapter 1013: Epoch Trial

Under the boundless starry expanse of the Demon Domain, terrifying heavenly punishment continued. Within the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array, the Mingyu elder sat like a mountain at the center of the array, unshaken by all. No matter how many seven-color humanoid lightning forms struck him, they couldn't harm him at all.

"Saintly peak truly powerful. I didn't expect even heavenly Dao energy-formed humanoid lightning couldn't harm him!" People's faces showed reverence as they gazed at the Mingyu elder within the array.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, sensing the elder had another plan. Otherwise, with his strength, he could have already broken through this Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array.

Although Wàn Língkōng said this array could trap saintly peaks, it might be true. But from the previous few late-stage elders who had caused cracks in the array, Luo Tian knew this array could definitely trap the elder. Even if it could trap him, it wasn't something Wàn Língkōng could currently arrange.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian ignored others, his face showing determination. He drew the bowstring, gathering black magic arrows and aiming them at the elder.

"Luo Tian, truly crazy! Even saintly peak!" People around gasped, eyes filled with intense disbelief.

"Crack..." The black magic arrow, carrying overwhelming might, instantly rushed into the array toward the saintly peak elder.

But in an instant, the elder slowly opened his eyes. Golden light flashed within them, with faint gray qi flowing from the elder's eyes.

"Go away..." A low voice came from the elder, like heavenly might. The black magic arrow that had reached the elder's forehead instantly transformed into a mass of dark qi, floating around the elder.

At the same time, the humanoid lightning forms striking the elder exploded with a thunderous roar, transforming into rolling lightning that vanished from sight.

People's eyes showed shock as they gazed at the Mingyu elder, their expressions filled with disbelief. Just one glance had caused the black magic arrow capable of annihilating late-stage saints and the humanoid lightning to collapse. What kind of cultivation was this?

At the moment the elder opened his eyes, Luo Tian's eyes widened in shock. His expression was filled with intense amazement: "He's not a saintly peak, he's a step toward the Epoch Realm!"

Luo Tian's heart surged with waves of shock. He seemed to have guessed the elder's intention, his eyes filled with strong amazement.

"I really should thank you!" The elder smiled slightly, then gazed at the void above with a touch of excitement.

"How many years has it been? I've remained at the step toward the Epoch Realm. It's not that I didn't want to enter the Epoch Realm, but this sky has changed! I couldn't enter the Epoch Realm! Those few guys are now at the Epoch Realm, but only I remain stuck at the step toward the Epoch Realm. It's quite embarrassing!" The elder spoke slowly, his voice carrying a touch of melancholy.

"Your mother's!" Luo Tian wished to hit himself twice. At this moment, hearing the elder's words, Luo Tian finally understood why the elder hadn't fought yet.

"He wants to use the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array to summon an Epoch Realm trial, entering the Epoch Realm!" Luo Tian's intestines were almost regretful. His heart trembled.

"Run!" The first thought in Luo Tian's mind was to escape. The elder hadn't time to deal with him yet. If the elder completed his trial, then he truly had no chance of escape.

But Luo Tian noticed the false Epoch Treasure within the array. He thought inwardly, his soul-securing cauldron was already somewhat insufficient. There were also Zhao Fengshan and his wife inside it. This false Epoch Treasure cauldron would be perfect for increasing the success rate of his soul-rebirth pills.

"Thunderous rumbling..." A deep thunder sound echoed again. Now, with no one else left, the entire array only had the elder. Thus, the heavenly trial would target him alone, a trial that even a step toward the Epoch Realm powerhouse would fear.

Thinking this through, Luo Tian's mind became active. He retrieved the Epoch Bell and silently prayed it would protect him.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian hid within the Epoch Bell, walking into the array again under people's shocked gazes. His speed was极致 (extreme), instantly appearing beside the golden cauldron.

"Brave, aren't you? Daring to enter the array to take that false Epoch Treasure!" People's faces showed shock, gazing at Luo Tian. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to dare take the treasure under the Mingyu elder's nose.

"Kid, you're really bold!" The Mingyu elder's face showed disdain. He was about to strike Luo Tian down.

But in an instant, a gray figure appeared before the elder. A palm strike was launched, causing waves of power. The elder's eyes turned serious.

Luo Tian quickly retrieved the cauldron, then felt a terrifying fluctuation behind him. His heart trembled.

"Crack..." Like a thunderclap, Luo Tian's ears heard阵阵 (numerous) thunder sounds. He spat out blood, his eyes filled with shock.

Quickly retrieving the array disc, he instantly vanished from the array. His face was pale to the extreme.

"A step toward the Epoch Realm, truly terrifying! Just a residual fluctuation has injured me severely!" Luo Tian felt his internal organs had shifted.

But his face remained calm. He forcibly swallowed the blood about to spew out, his expression serene as he stood outside the array.

"Strong! A ruthless person!" People hadn't expected Luo Tian to dare take a tiger's teeth, seizing the false Epoch Treasure during a step toward the Epoch Realm powerhouse's trial.

"Are you still going to block me?" Luo Tian took two steps forward, addressing everyone with a voice not loud but authoritative.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, people parted a path. They no longer dared to attack Luo Tian. After all, today he had truly intimidated them.

Luo Tian let out a cold snort, his voice filled with ice. He took a step forward and glanced back at the elder locked in battle with the gray figure.

After looking, Luo Tian's soul and spirit were terrified. He could feel the gray figure's power.

"The heavenly Dao's manifestation! The trial of entering the Epoch Realm summons the heavenly Dao's manifestation!" People gazed at the gray figure within the array, their faces showing shock. Some elders saw the gray figure and immediately recalled ancient records about entering the Epoch Realm's trial.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's intestines were almost regretful. If not for him, the elder would still be at a step toward the Epoch Realm. By causing this disturbance, he might truly enter the Epoch Realm.

The roaring continued. The Mingyu Domain's step toward the Epoch Realm elder showed no fear, even excitement on his face. He fought against the heavenly trial. Each collision shattered countless parts of the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array.

"I can't stay here anymore. This old man has no time to deal with me. If he truly ascends, I'll have no chance of escape!" Luo Tian thought this through and didn't linger. He needed to find a place to recover his injuries. His current strength was only three-tenths of before.

Although he had the Heaven-Striking Bow, Luo Tian dared not use it again. This consumption reduced the number of uses for the Heaven-Striking Bow, leaving only four left. Luo Tian decided to use it sparingly, as it was his life-saving tool against late-stage saints.

Fortunately, Luo Tian's intimidation had been sufficient. He believed no one would dare trouble him for a long time. His achievements today were enough to make him famous across the nine domains.

Under people's reverent gazes, Luo Tian vanished from sight. People didn't know that if they had intercepted him now, it would have been a sure thing. Two mid-stage saints could have killed Luo Tian.

But people were truly terrified of Luo Tian. The impact today was too great, and they had been scared to death by his ruthlessness.

"I won't chase anymore. From now on, I mustn't provoke this ancestor!" People watched Luo Tian's distant figure, discussing.

However, people soon thought of the Mingyu Domain elder's words about the step toward the Epoch Realm. That meant Luo Tian couldn't cultivate, remaining at the early-stage saint level.

"Regrettable. In this era of rising geniuses and kings, the reincarnation body can't shine alone!" People's faces showed a sigh of regret. Although now it seemed Luo Tian was invincible at his level.

But within a hundred years, all the rising geniuses would enter mid-stage saints, late-stage saints, even the Epoch Realm. But Luo Tian remained at early-stage saint level. What a sad situation.

Those who had once trampled over him would eventually leave him far behind. How painful it was.

"Alas..." With people's long sighs, Luo Tian appeared on a continent. His face was pale.

"This continent is good. The highest cultivation is only the Super-Immortal level, with just a few early-stage saintly energies. It's suitable for me to recover!" Luo Tian landed in a forest, his face grim. He carved out a cave and began to recover his injuries.

With continuous nourishment from pills, it took seven days for Luo Tian to fully recover. His body radiated golden light again, and a powerful aura spread from his body.

"I wonder if the Mingyu elder has successfully passed the Epoch trial. If he did, it would be a big problem!" Luo Tian sighed, changing his appearance and appearing on this continent.

Since this continent wasn't large, people's cultivation was low. But the information was very timely. After all, they were in the Demon Domain. Luo Tian quickly found out about the Mingyu elder's news. After all, the step toward the Epoch Realm's trial was too big.

Chapter 1014: Sumeru Continent

On a continent, after several days of recovery, Luo Tian's injuries were completely healed. He walked on this continent, listening to the current news in the Demon Domain, especially about the Mingyu elder's step toward the Epoch Realm. Luo Tian desperately wanted to know.

Luo Tian quickly entered a teahouse that seemed to be prepared for cultivators. He found an empty seat and sat down. People came and went around him, including beasts that had transformed into human forms and humans. After all, the Demon Domain was in turmoil now, with many cultivators from other domains entering it.

As soon as he sat down, Luo Tian ordered a cup of spiritual tea. His vast spiritual sense spread outward, encompassing the entire teahouse. There was no saintly powerhouse here; only one step toward a saint, who couldn't detect Luo Tian's spiritual sense.

"Did you hear? A few days ago, that genius named Luo Tian wiped out all those who chased him!"

"Of course I heard. Such a big event, with several late-stage saintly powers and many mid-stage saints, some disciples. All were killed by Luo Tian's heavenly trial!" As soon as Luo Tian sat down, he heard his own news. His eyes slightly twitched.

"Also, the most shocking thing is that among those chasing Luo Tian was a step toward the Epoch Realm powerhouse. By using Luo Tian's array, he actually summoned an Epoch Realm trial!" People's words made Luo Tian's heart move. He listened carefully.

"Yes, a step toward the Epoch Realm powerhouse ascending is terrifying. It's said that finally Luo Tian fled, but those who initially surrounded Luo Tian didn't escape at all. They were annihilated by the trial's waves!"

"It's said that the elder's ascension was so big, that even now the starry sky hasn't recovered. Anyone passing by would be sucked in by an unknown force!" A sly person, with a look of envy on his face, spoke to the people around.

"Cut it out, kid. How do you know so much? You're talking as if you saw it yourself. You must be lying!" People smiled, addressing the youth.

"Brother, do you know if that Mingyu elder successfully ascended?" Luo Tian smiled and asked the youth.

"It was successful, I think. That Mingyu elder apparently suffered heavy injuries. Before the Eight Great Clans arrived, he left the trial area! However, this matter has been confirmed by the貂祖 (Fangzhu) of the幽冥鬼貂 (Yao Ming Gui Chao) clan, a step toward the Epoch Realm powerhouse, Cui Yuanshan. He said that old man was injured but left behind an Epoch Realm aura!" The youth answered everything, addressing the people's questions.

"If what the youth said is true, that old man won't come out for a while!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. The pressure of the Epoch Realm was truly too great.

"Thank you, little brother. If there's anything you need help with, just say it!" Luo Tian smiled, noticing the youth had something on his mind.

The youth's cultivation wasn't high. He was only at the Five Source Supreme level. Although to Luo Tian, it wasn't much, but on this small continent, he was already a good genius.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the youth's face lit up. He showed a serious expression and bowed to the people around: "Everyone, this Sumeru Continent isn't large in the Demon Domain. But we are a cultivator continent. Recently, multiple sects have said their disciples were kidnapped and are still missing!"

"I've recently found out where those who kidnapped the geniuses are hiding. I'm alone and weak, so I hope everyone will go with me to their hideout and wipe them out!" The youth showed a sense of justice, addressing the people.

But then everyone fell silent. Long-term residents on this Sumeru Continent had heard about the kidnapping of geniuses and some potential children. These people were elusive and ruthless. A few days ago, a sect's early-stage saintly commander found their hideout and tried to eliminate them with the sect's strength. But they were annihilated by those people.

After that, no one dared to trouble them. Although they knew these people were evil, no one could deal with them.

"Kid, I know who you are. You're the only remaining disciple of the sect that was destroyed. And your sister was also kidnapped. This grudge must be avenged, but don't drag us down with you! I advise you to seek help from the Holy City!" People discussed, obviously not wanting to get involved.

"Exactly. You want to die, but we don't want to die. Find someone else to be your backup!" Someone mocked, his face showing contempt.

The youth's face gradually showed disappointment. His face turned red, and he smiled bitterly, walking out of the teahouse. He knew these people wouldn't help him. Previously, he had asked this continent's sects for help, and the responses were similar. Some sects told him they had already passed this news to the Holy City.

But the Holy City was too chaotic now. It wouldn't have time to care about this small Sumeru Continent's survival. By the time the Holy City sent people, his sister would have died many times.

"I'll help you!" Just as the youth turned around, Luo Tian's voice echoed in the noisy teahouse. People's faces showed shock.

The youth stopped, his face happy. He turned to look at Luo Tian but saw a young man not much older than himself, his face showing disappointment.

Since Luo Tian had hidden his cultivation, the youth couldn't detect it. In the youth's view, Luo Tian was at most a Super-Immortal level. How could he possibly face the people who had destroyed an entire sect?

"Thank you, brother! As they said, going there is just suicide!" The youth saw Luo Tian smiling and lightly bowed.

"Does that group have a late-stage saint?" Luo Tian grabbed the youth, asking him.

"They probably don't. My sect's Grand Master was an early-stage saint. He fought against that person, who was very strong but had some difficulty!" The youth's eyes showed thoughtfulness as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Let's go. I'll show you. Maybe I can help!" Luo Tian said, not having a late-stage saint, so he wasn't afraid.

At this moment, even facing mid-stage saints, Luo Tian had a chance. The condition was not to use the Heaven-Striking Bow. Using it, even late-stage saints would retreat from Luo Tian.

"This..." The youth's face showed complex feelings. He didn't want to let Luo Tian go to his death, hesitating.

"Alright, you already have a death wish. What else is there to fear? Come with me. Maybe I really can help!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, his eyes showing confidence.

Luo Tian had a good impression of this youth. It was just a small favor, repaying the person who brought him news.

"Okay!" The youth seemed to have made a decision, nodded at Luo Tian, and led him out of the teahouse.

The youth was a Five Source Supreme level. On this Sumeru Continent, he was already strong. He transformed into a long dragon and led Luo Tian northward.

Along the way, the youth was surprised. He had intentionally used his full strength, reaching his maximum speed to test Luo Tian's strength. But the youth's face was always smiling. No matter how fast he accelerated, Luo Tian was light as a feather, making the youth feel some hope.

"Is he an ancient hidden powerhouse?" The youth's heart trembled, then led Luo Tian to a mountain range. His face gradually showed seriousness, slowing down.

"Hmm?" As soon as they entered the mountain range, Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly. He grabbed the youth and stopped.

"This mountain range is strange!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes showing surprise. His eyes turned purple, like two lightning bolts. At the same time, his vast spiritual sense enveloped the entire mountain range.

"Master! Definitely a master!" The youth looked at Luo Tian, sensing an aura of strength. He had already determined that Luo Tian was definitely a powerhouse.

"Wow, this array is quite mysterious. I wonder if it's artificial or natural!" Luo Tian's eyes showed intense light.

In his view, each tree and mountain range was naturally formed, like a natural great array. Rushing in would definitely lose oneself within it. Even early-stage saints couldn't escape.

"You stay here!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing the youth and stepping forward. He vanished from the spot.

The youth didn't dare disobey Luo Tian's words, but his face showed deep concern.

Luo Tian instantly appeared above the mountain range. He felt the surrounding environment changed, muttering softly: "Thankfully I have these eyes; otherwise, I would have been tricked!"

Luo Tian's eyes turned purple, seeing through the array's essence. His body transformed into a streak of light and instantly appeared at the peak of the mountain range's central point.

A grand palace stood atop the peak, enclosed by an array. From outside the array, it was impossible to detect the palace's presence.

Luo Tian stood above the palace. His spiritual sense swept in, rushing into the palace. In an instant, his eyes flashed with cold light. He grabbed the crackling spear and shot it out, transforming into a golden storm that swept toward the palace.

Chapter 1015: Blood Demon Sect

On the Sumeru Continent, within a mountain range, Luo Tian stood atop a grand palace. His face was filled with killing intent.

His vast spiritual sense rushed into the palace. Inside, a youth with a twisted face held a girl in his hands. He pulled her apart, scattering red blood on his body and absorbing it into his body.

Nearby, about a dozen black-cloaked subordinates stood respectfully. Their faces showed no emotion.

In the corner of the palace, a large cage stood. Inside were nearly a hundred boys and girls, huddled together in fear, their eyes filled with terror as they gazed at the youth seated there. They were treated like livestock.

These hundred boys and girls, although trembling, had good cultivation. They could be considered among the best on this Sumeru Continent.

"Next!" The youth's voice showed no emotion. His subordinates rushed forward, opening the cage and grabbing a boy in his teens as if catching an animal. They carried him toward the youth.

"Let me go! I'm a disciple of the Renwang Sect. Don't you fear our sect's retaliation?" The boy shouted, his voice filled with despair.

"Haha, the Renwang Sect is nothing. It's an honor for you to help our sect's prince recover!" The black-cloaked subordinate showed disdain, throwing the boy toward the youth.

"Too weak. This place is too weak! The disciples of those great sects are only at the world-king level!" The youth's face showed dissatisfaction.

The youth grabbed the boy, about to tear him apart. Suddenly, the entire palace trembled with a thunderous roar. In an instant, the whole palace was reduced to ruins by a golden storm.

A golden figure stood like a warrior in the sky. His eyes flashed with infinite killing intent, his purple gaze fixed on the youth seated there.

"Beast!" Luo Tian's face was cold. He hadn't expected them to be so cruel, even targeting children. His spear pointed at the youth.

"Lu Tian!" The youth's face showed panic. He threw the boy out and stood up, fleeing toward the distance.

"Know me?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion. But in an instant, he remembered who the youth was.

Previously, Luo Tian had set up the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array and killed a group of disciples. One disciple had escaped using a false Epoch Treasure, which was the youth before him.

"Who are you? How dare you come to my Blood Demon Sect's base!" The youth's subordinates showed trembling faces. Luo Tian's spear had already intimidated them. They were only at the step toward a saint level, unable to withstand Luo Tian's attack. They wanted to use their sects to intimidate him.

"Seems you were injured in the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array and came here to recover your injuries by using these sect disciples!" Luo Tian felt some guilt, thinking he had indirectly caused their suffering.

"Want to escape?" Luo Tian's feet created wind. He activated the Yellowness Ghost Step, appearing before the youth. His golden spear transformed into a golden dragon and rushed toward him.

The youth had already been injured in the Ten Thousand Heavens' Punishment array and hadn't fully recovered. Being scared by Luo Tian, he only wanted to escape.

"Lu Tian, let me go! I swear from now on I'll never trouble you again. If you don't, the Blood Demon Sect will never let you go!" The Blood Demon Sect's disciple showed madness in his face, his voice filled with desperate requests.
