"Right now, you are nothing but an insolent little clown. Let them play with you first!" Wang Mietian showed no concern, for up until now, everything remained within his grasp. Once he fully absorbed the soul of the First Heaven Demon King, no one would be able to truly challenge him anymore.

Wang Mietian extended his hand, and a magical pattern shot forth from his fingertips, transforming into a black dragon that coiled around Yi Jianren, the Holy Son of the Suffering God Temple. The dark pattern instantly merged into Yi Jianren's body, causing his face to darken with displeasure.

"My cultivation!" The next moment, Yi Jianren's expression turned grim as he stared at Wang Mietian with fear.

"Kill him, and I'll let you go!" Wang Mietian spoke to Yi Jianren, a smile on his face.

Yi Jianren's expression remained dark as he gazed at Wang Mietian standing there, then glanced toward Luo Tian who struggled towards Duan Zijue's corpse. The suppressed aura had vanished, granting Yi Jianren his freedom.

"Kill!" After a brief hesitation, Yi Jianren recalled how Luo Tian had once driven him into psychological trauma during the Ten Palaces Competition. If he didn't kill Luo Tian now, he would die. Though his cultivation was no longer under his control, Yi Jianren believed that with Huangtian Temple's resources, they could certainly heal him.

In an instant, the Yellow Heaven Blade emitted a faint yellow glow and landed in Yi Jianren's hand. With a step, he charged toward Luo Tian.

"Whirrr..." Before long, the Yellow Heaven Blade descended upon Luo Tian's head. Luo Tian's face darkened.

"Get out of my way..." Luo Tian roared, his hands moving swiftly as he slammed them together above his head. The Yellow Heaven Blade was caught between his two hands, causing Yi Jianren's eyes to widen in shock.

"How is this possible!" Yi Jianren gasped, realizing the sheer strength of Luo Tian's physical form.

Luo Tian lifted his leg and kicked Yi Jianren, sending him flying back like a ball.

Chapter 2505: I Am Injured

Yi Jianren landed awkwardly on the ground, his expression filled with disbelief. Ye Qiu and others also showed astonishment.

"Useless!" Wang Mietian muttered, watching Yi Jianren lying on the ground. He hadn't expected this outcome where even Yi Jianren couldn't kill Luo Tian. Wang Mietian extended his hand, and five more magical patterns appeared, forming five long dragons that enveloped the five Holy Sons. Their faces darkened.

"You go and kill him, and I'll let you leave!" Wang Mietian addressed the five men, causing their expressions to darken.

"Kill..." At once, three of them rushed forward, faces filled with frustration and resentment. But for survival, they had no choice but to kill Luo Tian.

Wang Xiu's face was dark. He too had been infected with a demon seed, but he was proud and refused to be controlled.

"Soulsuck..." As the three rushed out, Luo Tian finally reached Duan Zijue's corpse. He grabbed at the withered body. Waves spread, and wisps of gray mist emerged from Duan Zijue's withered form, gradually gathering in Luo Tian's hands.

At the same time, the three Holy Sons' attacks reached Luo Tian. A long sword slashed downward toward Luo Tian, while a fist and a black hand struck his back. Boom! Boom! Boom... The three attacks exploded against Luo Tian's back, sending him flying and spewing blood from his mouth. Yet, Luo Tian clutched Duan Zijue's corpse tightly with one hand and continued to gather the gray mist with the other.

"Luo Tian!" Sudan and Luo Shui cried out, watching Luo Tian's torn back, bloodied flesh.

"This body is too strong. I used my full strength and still couldn't kill him?" Fan Tianyin's face showed disbelief as he watched Luo Tian, pale and blood moving across his body, seemingly recovering.

"Spit...!" Luo Tian coughed violently, eyes wild with madness. The gray mist in his hands finally solidified into Duan Zijue's form.

"You're still watching?" Wang Mietian felt an ominous premonition, a feeling that had saved him multiple times. He barked at the three stunned men, who gritted their teeth in anger. Few had ever dared to scold them in Hell.

"You two as well, hurry up!" Wang Mietian turned to Wang Xiu and the Holy Son of Suffering God Temple, barking at them.

"What are you? Daring to scold us like this? Today I'd rather die here than obey your orders!" Wang Xiu roared, his body radiating intense waves as he stepped forward toward Wang Mietian.

"I like your spirit!" Wang Mietian sneered, extending his hand. The faces of Wang Xiu and the two Holy Sons twisted instantly.

"Ah..." A scream echoed as Wang Xiu and the two Holy Sons collapsed to the ground, their bodies convulsing violently.

"Come out!" Luo Tian roared, finally fully extracting Duan Zijue's soul and manifesting it before him. Boom! Boom! Boom...

However, four more explosions erupted from Luo Tian's back, sending him flying into the magic cloud. It was Fan Tianyin and the others plus Yi Jianren's attack.

"It's over!" The four took a deep breath, their combined attacks capable of annihilating an intermediate Heaven Demon King. Luo Tian had already suffered heavy injuries, leaving no path to survival.

"Duan Zijue!" Sudan's eyes turned red. Black ghost energy burst from his body, and he looked mad, breaking free of the black cloud's pressure.

"Roar..." A ghostly creature howled, wrapping Sudan in a black fox shadow. With powerful claws, it struck the ground but didn't attack Fan Tianyin's group directly. Instead, it rushed toward the magic cloud where Luo Tian had been thrown.

"Submit to me as well!" Wang Mietian ignored Sudan's madness, his hands moving. A series of black script dragons emerged from his hands, enveloping the remaining Ye Qiu and others.

"Damn it!" Everyone's faces darkened, feeling their lives and cultivation were no longer in their control. The black magic cloud pressed lower, an oppressive atmosphere making it hard to breathe. Ye Qiu and others stared at Wang Mietian standing there, now a godlike figure in their eyes.

"Are you ready to submit now?" Wang Mietian looked down at Ye Qiu and others.

"Master Wang Mietian!" Just as Wang Mietian gazed at Ye Qiu and others, a roar echoed from the black cloud. A gray figure rushed out, voice filled with endless hatred.

"Duan Zijue!" People saw the gray figure and showed disbelief. They hadn't expected to see Duan Zijue again.

"It's a soul! I understand now. Luo Tian can extract the souls of the dead!" People looked at the gray soul and gasped, but their eyes still carried bitterness because their demon seeds had already formed.

Boom... As Duan Zijue appeared, the shattered soul fragments of the First Heaven Demon King began to tremble. Instead of gathering toward Wang Mietian, they rushed toward Duan Zijue's soul.

"Hope of life!" Duan Zijue's gray eyes carried madness. His soul had been extremely weak, having all of it absorbed by Wang Mietian. Rebirth was difficult for him. If not for Luo Tian extracting his soul, he would have already died. It was the reformation of his soul that gave Duan Zijue a chance to survive.

The newly formed soul allowed him to completely escape the control of Dao Heart Demon Seed. His soul was safe, and his body was no longer an issue.

"Come to me!" Duan Zijue roared. He was the true heir of the First Heaven Demon King, so he could also master the methods left by the First Heaven Demon King. Moreover, he was more familiar with them than Wang Mietian.

The gray soul clashed with Wang Mietian for the First Heaven Demon King's soul fragments, causing Wang Mietian's face to darken. He hadn't expected an unexpected twist.

"You still looking? Kill him!" Wang Mietian hadn't anticipated Luo Tian extracting Duan Zijue's soul. Now, the greatest threat to him in the Heaven Demon King City was Duan Zijue, this deceased person.

The gray soul fiercely gathered, continuously devouring the soul fragments. His weakened consciousness became more solid.

"That's mine!" Wang Mietian growled, unable to bear it. He raised his hand and pressed toward Duan Zijue's soul.

"This time, I won't let you take advantage of my weakness!" Duan Zijue roared. He opened his mouth and sucked in the First Heaven Demon King's soul fragments, instantly devouring them without any intention of refining. He was too familiar with this残魂 and was the true heir of the First Heaven Demon King.

Duan Zijue's gray soul appeared. Though it was a soul body, it gave people the feeling of surpassing his previous physical form.

Duan Zijue extended his hand and struck, a gray hand emitting terrifying power toward the black magic cloud above.

Boom... The thunderous sound echoed in everyone's ears, like a rising thunderclap, making their faces pale.

The black magic cloud churned. Two figures appeared in Ye Qiu's view, causing them to gasp.

"They're still alive!" People saw the two figures. They were Sudan and Luo Tian, with Luo Tian appearing like a bloodied man, supported by Sudan.

The Blood Knife flew up and landed on Luo Tian's body. Crimson flowers reappeared, and vitality began to rapidly transmit toward Luo Tian.

"My god, they're still alive. The Hell-Immortal Body is truly terrifying!" People forgot their demon seeds, faces filled with shock. They felt Luo Tian was a monster.

"Still watching? Kill him!" Man Youlan's face showed grotesque expressions as she addressed Ye Qiu and others.

"You..." Ye Qiu and others looked at Man Youlan's appearance, their eyes burning with anger. Previously, they would never have given her a second glance. Even if they did, she was just a woman, an accessory. Now, this person was commanding them, which they couldn't bear.

"Everyone, I can break the Dao Heart Demon Seed!" Just as their faces darkened, a weak voice spoke, causing their expressions to instantly brighten.

"But I need time. It depends on whether Duan Zijue can defeat Wang Mietian!" Luo Tian looked at Duan Zijue fighting with Wang Mietian, and walked toward Ye Qiu and others while being supported by Sudan.

With Duan Zijue's appearance, the black magic cloud above was disturbed. The pressure wasn't as strong as before.

"Really can?" Ye Qiu and others looked at Luo Tian with doubt. They could feel the strength of the Dao Heart Demon Seed within them.

"Try it. I have only a few chances!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and ten-colored flames erupted, enveloping everyone.

"It'll hurt a little, but you should be able to endure it!" Luo Tian spoke to them.

"This is only a temporary separation from the Dao Heart Demon Seed. As for breaking it, I still need to think!" Luo Tian smiled at Ye Qiu and others wrapped in ten-colored flames.

The previous attacks from Fan Tianyin and Yi Jianren had nearly killed Luo Tian. Though they were forced to attack him, Luo Tian wasn't someone who forgot grudges.

"I need to recover!" Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his eyes glowing with intense light. If those brothers who knew him saw this look in his eyes, they would know someone was definitely going to suffer.

"Too injured!" Luo Tian softly sighed. He wasn't lying; he was truly severely wounded. Those four's attacks had come so close to killing him. He was alive now only because of luck, relying on his last strength to protect his head and heart.

Chapter 2506: Luo Shui's Demise

The Heaven Demon King City had become a hell on earth. A continuous stream of strong warriors who had pledged allegiance to Wang Mietian slaughtered the people in the Heaven Demon King City and those Hell warriors who had come to watch.

Blood continuously gathered into the black magic cloud. A group of warriors in black robes surrounded the magic cloud, maintaining the magic cloud formation's operation.

The ten-colored flames enveloped Ye Qiu and others within the black magic cloud. Luo Tian sat cross-legged outside the flames.

Nearby, a gray figure continuously fought against Wang Mietian. The sound of explosions echoed everywhere, shaking the entire Heaven Demon King City.

"Duan Zijue is struggling!" Ye Qiu and others observed Duan Zijue's soul fighting against Wang Mietian. They had fought for half an hour, but Duan Zijue's soul body made it difficult to use certain techniques. Moreover, if not for the methods left by the First Heaven Demon King, Duan Zijue wouldn't have had a chance to fight Wang Mietian. In contrast, Wang Mietian's momentum was strong; he soon suppressed Duan Zijue. Though not yet at the late Heaven Demon King stage, his strength was formidable.

Ye Qiu and others were anxious. As Duan Zijue continuously shook the magic cloud, their pressure lessened, but the demon seeds within them were the biggest隐患. If Duan Zijue failed, all their efforts would be in vain.

"Luo Xiong, I have good healing medicine. Take it quickly!" Ye Qiu could no longer bear watching and hoped Luo Tian would recover soon to release their demon seeds, giving them a chance at survival.

"I have the elixir of immortality!" Wang Xiu and others understood, handing their healing items to Luo Tian. Luo Tian didn't refuse, hoping to recover quickly. If he recovered, he might be able to help Duan Zijue resist Wang Mietian.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

Luo Tian poured a handful of spiritual herbs and pills into his body. Ye Qiu and others were the future successors of the Ten Palaces, so their items weren't inferior. After consuming them, Luo Tian's injuries rapidly recovered.

"Both of you, go and kill that Luo Tian!" Wang Mietian ordered the two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors outside the formation. At this point, they had already finished slaughtering the people in the Heaven Demon King City and stood outside the formation.

"Yes!" The two old men's faces showed bitterness. Their bodies also had demon seeds, so they couldn't help but obey Wang Mietian.

Previously, they had slaughtered the people of the Heaven Demon King City, causing them great pain. If it weren't for necessity, they wouldn't have done this. After all, this was their home where they had lived for countless years. Moreover, Duan Zijue had once been their city's leader, though cruel, he wasn't as mad and inhumane as Wang Mietian.

"Kill!" Things had already happened, leaving them no other choice but to go all the way.

In an instant, the two warriors rushed into the magic cloud toward Luo Tian sitting cross-legged.

"Roar..." A low roar echoed. Seven black tails swirled, and the Black Fox wrapped around Sudan, standing in front of Luo Tian.

"Get out of my way!" In a flash, the two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors reached Sudan. A long sword slashed with an overwhelming sword aura, cutting toward Sudan.

"Only you two?" Sudan waved his hand, and black claws directly grabbed the opponent's shoulder. A piercing sound echoed in the world, and the black sword aura was instantly destroyed by the black claws.

Another long knife was also caught by the black tails. Sudan roared, and the blade and sword light were destroyed by his attack.

Blades and swords clashed again. The two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors began to fight against Sudan, who had a wild look and fought one-on-two.

Sudan was once an Eight Heaven Kings. He had always relied on seduction to fight enemies, and no one knew his true strength. Now, to save Luo Tian, he fully unleashed his power, making him terrifying.

"Quickly! Hurry up!" Luo Tian felt anxious, watching Sudan fighting one-on-two. He could see that Sudan had paid a price to reach this state.

Previously, Sudan had broken free from the magic cloud's immense pressure and rescued Luo Tian. That had cost him a lot. Now, fighting one-on-two to block them, if he passed his peak, Sudan would also be in danger.

Luo Tian's body was originally extremely strong. After mastering the Hell-Immortal Body, which could recover as long as he didn't die, and with Ye Qiu's healing medicine, his recovery was very fast.

Boom... However, as Luo Tian recovered, a loud explosion echoed in people's ears. The black fox body suddenly shattered, and Sudan's slender figure flew back, colliding with the black magic cloud. Blood spurted from his mouth.

Cough... The two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors also had pale faces, watching Sudan fall to the ground. They too had paid a heavy price to wound Sudan.

"Kill!" The two didn't bother with Sudan anymore but rushed toward Luo Tian. They couldn't disobey Wang Mietian's orders.

"Thousand Rivers of Luo Shui!" As the two took another step, a wild voice echoed again. A waterfall-like wave of swords descended from the sky toward them.

"Father!" Luo Tian saw the figure standing in front of him, his eyes turning red. He felt Luo Shui's vitality rapidly fading.

"Quickly recover! After you recover, remember to take Sudan out!" Luo Shui shouted, holding his sword and rushing toward the two Heaven Demon King warriors.

"Death intent!" Luo Tian felt Luo Shui's death intent and felt sad.

At this moment, the entire Luo family had only one person left—Luo Shui. If not for his desire to avenge, he might have already collapsed.

"Die! A mere half-step Heaven Demon King who briefly entered the early stage of Heaven Demon King, how dare you block us!" The two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors sneered.

"Whirr..." Blades and swords clashed. The two divine beams instantly destroyed Luo Shui's three thousand sword waves, rushing toward him.

Plop! Plop... Two wounds instantly appeared on Luo Shui's body. However, he didn't retreat even a step, fighting desperately to prevent the two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors from attacking Luo Tian.

Sword waves and blade shadows collided continuously. Initially, Luo Shui's momentum was strong, but as time passed, it became increasingly difficult. After a incense stick's worth of time, Luo Shui had turned into a bloodied man. His body was cut and flew to the ground.

"Uncle!" Sudan, blood spitting, rushed to Luo Shui's side. He looked at Luo Tian and shook his head.

"Die!" One of the two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors rushed toward Sudan and Luo Shui, while the other rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Your death!" As the two moved, Luo Tian finally acted. He suddenly stood up like a wild beast and rushed toward Luo Shui and Sudan.

"Crack..." As he ran, Luo Tian's body directly collided with the Heaven Demon King early-stage warrior. A crackling sound immediately echoed, sending the old man flying.

"How is this possible!" The Heaven Demon King early-stage warrior's eyes showed disbelief. He spat blood and fell to the ground in a miserable state.

"Whirr..." A blade slashed toward Sudan and Luo Shui, but as soon as Luo Tian's body arrived, he grabbed the black blade with his hand. Blood flowed from Luo Tian's palm.

"Die!" Luo Tian roared and kicked the old man, sending him flying.

"Father!" Luo Tian looked at Luo Shui's fading breath and felt sad. He quickly fed the healing medicine Ye Qiu had given him to Luo Shui.

"Don't waste it. My meridians are all broken. Don't try to save me; let me reincarnate!" After taking Luo Tian's healing medicine, Luo Shui felt a little better. However, his eyes carried death.

"Live on, even if you don't seek revenge, live on!" Luo Shui extended his hand and gently placed it on Luo Tian's head. In his eyes, Luo Tian's figure overlapped with Luochen's.

"Would you like to see my child?" Tears flowed from Luo Tian's eyes as he spoke to Luo Shui. He knew Luo Shui was in pain, but he always wanted Luo Shui to live.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Luo Shui's eyes had a glimmer of life. Finally, he shook his head gently and closed his eyes.

"Father!" Luo Tian bowed to Luo Shui's corpse.

Although Luo Tian had some methods that could greatly increase the chances of Luo Shui surviving, he knew Luo Shui didn't want to live in pain.

"Soulsuck!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and wisps of gray mist emerged from Luo Shui's body. They appeared in Luo Tian's hands.

The gray soul was very weak, obviously having nearly lost his life from the techniques he had used. If not handled, it might not be able to reincarnate. Therefore, Luo Tian had no choice but to extract the soul.

Luo Tian collected Luo Shui's soul and extended his hand again, taking up Luo Shui's Qiu Shui Sword. He looked at the two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors rushing toward him again.

"One Blade Overheaven!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, unleashing his strongest attack from memory. A sword technique.

"Whirr..." A terrifying wave of swords instantly erupted, and the Qiu Shui Sword began to rapidly draw on Luo Tian's recently recovered cultivation.

A furious aura erupted from the long sword in Luo Tian's hands. The next moment, a black wave of swords shot toward the two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors.

"This is!" Their faces instantly turned pale, feeling the terrifying energy in the sword wave.

They had already been greatly exhausted and wounded by Sudan and Luo Shui. Now, facing this terrifying sword wave, they had no chance to resist.

Plop! Plop... Two clouds of blood rose. The two Heaven Demon King early-stage warriors were instantly shattered by Luo Tian's sword wave, causing Ye Qiu and others to gasp.

Chapter 2507: Battle Against Wang Mietian

Crack! The long sword in Luo Tian's hand shattered, causing his heart to tremble. A sword has its own pride; Luo Shui chose to die, and the Qiu Shui Sword had followed him for years. It had even sacrificed itself with Luo Shui.

The black sword wave destroyed the two and did not stop. It continued toward Wang Mietian and Duan Zijue, causing Wang Mietian's face to darken.

"Damn it!" Wang Mietian cursed. He raised his hand, and a surge of demonic energy formed into a black magic sword, striking toward the black sword wave.

"Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique!" However, just as that black magic sword was struck, a cold voice echoed in Wang Mietian's ears. He shivered and felt an ominous premonition.

Plop... Wang Mietian barely reacted, a cloud of blood rose. His face turned even more furious.

The black sword wave took an unusual arc, bypassing Wang Mietian's magic sword and striking toward Wan Youlan.

"Stop!" Seeing Wan Youlan turn into a cloud of blood, Wang Mietian roared and broke free from his fight with Duan Zijue. He rushed toward the cloud of blood.

"Mother!" Wang Mietian looked at the rising blood mist, his hands continuously grabbing at it. However, blood stained his hands.

"Soulsuck!" A cold voice echoed in the world as Luo Tian extended his hand, directly grabbing Wan Youlan's soul.

"Luotian!" The gray soul looked at Luo Tian with fear.

Wang Mietian immediately stopped moving. He stared at Wan Youlan's soul, then looked at Luo Tian and roared: "Release my mother!"

"Daydream!" Luo Tian's face carried coldness as he looked at Wang Mietian, clenching Wan Youlan's soul in his hand.

"Boom..." As Wang Mietian and Luo Tian confronted each other, a loud explosion echoed in people's ears.

The black magic cloud exploded. A hole several zhang wide opened, and a gray figure rushed toward the opening.

"Wait until I return. You all must die!" A wild voice echoed, it was Duan Zijue who had fought with Wang Mietian.

At this moment, Duan Zijue was also extremely weak. Taking advantage of Wang Mietian and Luo Tian's confrontation, Duan Zijue knew his chance had come.

Escape was Duan Zijue's intention. In his view, Luo Tian and Wang Mietian were both no good people who would never let him go. Fighting against Wang Mietian was just a temporary measure. Now that Luo Tian had held Wang Mietian back, he had the chance to escape.

Nothing was more important than living. As long as he lived, with his strength, he could definitely recover. Even if not at his peak, he could still have plans in the future.

Therefore, Duan Zijue used all his strength to shake the magic cloud and tried to escape.

"Want to run?" Luo Tian sneered. He had extracted Duan Zijue's soul, so he naturally had a way to deal with him. He extended his hand and grabbed Duan Zijue, who was about to rush into the opening. A formless force restrained him instantly, and he turned into a streak of light, captured by Luo Tian.

"You!" Duan Zijue's gray eyes showed fear as he looked at the cold Luo Tian standing there.

"Luotian, if you release my mother, I can agree to any condition!" Wang Mietian was desperate. For Wang Mietian, Wan Youlan was too important. It was only because of her that he had achieved his current status.

"Son, don't mind me. Kill him!" Wan Youlan shouted loudly, her voice filled with madness.

"Son, I'm sorry for making you like this. After killing him, live a normal life!" Wan Youlan's voice carried bitterness.

"Silence!" Luo Tian felt uncomfortable hearing Wan Youlan call Wang Mietian "son," and he shouted loudly, intimidating Wan Youlan.

"Can't!" Wang Mietian roared, his eyes red. He stared at Luo Tian with a death grip.

"Say, how can I release my mother?"

"Such deep maternal affection!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration. He thought Wang Mietian was cold-hearted, but Wan Youlan was his soft spot.

"Suicide!" Luo Tian spoke coldly. He wanted to see how deep Wang Mietian's feelings for his mother truly were.

"Good! I'll commit suicide. You can plant the Dao Heart Demon Seed on me, but you must release my mother first!" Wang Mietian responded without hesitation.

"Don't!" Wan Youlan shouted, watching Wang Mietian. She knew he would truly sacrifice himself to save her.

"Mother, I can do anything for you!" Wang Mietian's face showed a smile. His hands began to form seals.

"Mother also, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let you be blinded by hatred. To avenge, you did many wrong things, even doing indecent things!"

"If I could start over, I would live normally like other children. Unfortunately, it's too late. Promise me that after killing Luo Tian, live a normal life and marry, have children!" Wan Youlan's gray face showed a smile. Her gray soul emitted a furious aura.

"Let me gather!" Luo Tian's face slightly changed as he began to fiercely gather Wan Youlan's soul. However, the soul that had always obeyed him this time did not. Boom! Wan Youlan's soul exploded, turning into wisps of gray mist that scattered before Luo Tian. Her soul was completely destroyed.

"Ahh..." Wang Mietian's eyes instantly turned red. He rushed toward Luo Tian like a wounded beast, emitting endless madness.

"Kill!" Wang Mietian roared. He raised his hand, and the magic cloud pressed down on heaven and earth with a terrifying wave.

"Block it! Otherwise, you'll die too!" Luo Tian waved his hand, throwing Duan Zijue's soul out. He also grabbed the Blood Knife in his hand.

"Crack..." The next moment, a thunderous sound echoed throughout the world. The black magic sword and Blood Knife collided. Luo Tian and Wang Mietian both retreated, looking at each other.

"Kill! Kill! I'll kill everyone around you!" Wang Mietian was mad. His mind was filled with Wan Youlan's last words and past memories. Wang Mietian had achieved this status because of Wan Youlan. Since he was old enough to understand, she had instilled hatred in him. To help Wang Mietian improve his strength, she used any means possible. Even more terrifying was that Wan Youlan had willingly used her furnace body with Wang Mietian, doing such despicable things. Therefore, Wang Mietian's personality had become twisted. For Wang Mietian, Wan Youlan was more than a mother; she was everything.

"Demon Killing the World!" Wang Mietian roared. The magic cloud above churned and instantly transformed into a massive mouth, opening to spit out countless sword waves toward Luo Tian.

"Gun Master of the Heavens!" Luo Tian moved his hands, and a crackling spear appeared in his right hand. He held the Blood Knife with his left hand, continuously moving it to block the endless sword waves.

Wang Mietian had also been wounded by Duan Zijue, otherwise he wouldn't have been at a disadvantage against Luo Tian in this formation. However, now, Luo Tian had the strength to fight Wang Mietian. But to kill Wang Mietian, his current state wasn't much better. In the end, it would likely be a mutual destruction.

Kill! Kill! Kill... Wang Mietian didn't care about his life, continuously attacking and clashing with Luo Tian. The thunderous collision sounds spread throughout the Heaven Demon King City.

The black magic cloud seemed to be Wang Mietian's source of power, keeping him in a prime state.

"Must win!" Ye Qiu and others stood within the ten-colored fire, continuously praying. Their lives were in Luo Tian's hands.

The thunderous sounds kept echoing. Luo Tian's sword and spear had no flaws, but due to his previous use of One Blade Overheaven, it had greatly exhausted him. Wang Mietian, on the other hand, seemed to have no limits, continuously attacking and gradually pushing Luo Tian into a disadvantage.

Time passed slowly. Half an hour had gone by, and Luo Tian finally felt his cultivation was insufficient.

...And just as Luo Tian was about to falter, the magic cloud above finally exploded. All those standing outside the magic cloud maintaining the formation spat blood and looked weak.

"Break through!" Duan Zijue's gray soul fell from the sky, also showing signs of weakness.

"Plop..." The magic cloud exploded. Wang Mietian spat blood, obviously having a strong connection with the magic cloud and the formation. One rise and one fall. However, Wang Mietian showed no concern. He extended his hand, and a furious wave erupted from it. A mountain of magic fell from the sky, directly crushing Duan Zijue's soul.

"Ahh..." Duan Zijue let out a painful scream. He had broken through the formation, but he was extremely weak. His hope was that Luo Tian would have a change of heart and let him live, even if it meant entering reincarnation.

"Boom..." Duan Zijue's weak soul was instantly shattered by the black magic mountain. Like Wan Youlan, he vanished without a trace.

"This time, it's truly over!" Ye Qiu and others' faces darkened as they watched Duan Zijue die. They also focused on Luo Tian and Wang Mietian's battle.

At this moment, both Luo Tian and Wang Mietian were in terrible condition. Both had massive wounds. Until the end, no one knew who would win.

"Come!" Wang Mietian roared again. A group of people in the Heaven Demon King City maintaining the formation were instantly shattered, turning into countless black demon seeds. Dozens of thousands of them gathered toward Wang Mietian.

"Come!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He opened his mouth and sucked in an invisible force. He knew he couldn't let Wang Mietian absorb those demon seeds. If he did, Wang Mietian might enter the late Heaven Demon King stage, and then he would have no chance of victory.

Chapter 2508: Ye Fengdu

Black demon seeds rained down like a storm. Two whirlwinds formed, and Luo Tian and Wang Mietian continuously absorbed the demon seeds, their power rising as they competed for them.

"Quickly contact the Grand Master!" Ye Qiu and others weren't idle. They felt their demon seeds began to tremble violently, but they were suppressed by the ten-colored flames that had infiltrated them. However, if this continued, it would be a matter of time before they broke free.

Time passed slowly. Dozens of thousands of demon seeds were finally absorbed by Luo Tian and Wang Mietian, both emitting a terrifying aura. They looked at each other.

"Damn it! I still haven't reached the late Heaven Demon King stage!" Wang Mietian's face darkened, watching Luo Tian who hadn't reached the middle Heaven Demon King stage either.

"Destroying Eight Directions!" Wang Mietian roared. He knew he couldn't delay any longer because the Holy Sons of several palaces and some Heaven Kings had already contacted their elders. If those people arrived, he would be doomed!

Pulsing demonic energy gathered in front of Wang Mietian. The demon seeds he had just absorbed exploded, releasing all his cultivation without any remaining reserves. A destructive and world-destroying aura radiated from Wang Mietian's body.

"Let me borrow your Absolute Cloud Sword!" Luo Tian addressed Ye Qiu, his voice also filled with madness. He knew this was a critical strike; if he failed, everything would end.

"Quickly!" Ye Qiu and others shouted.
