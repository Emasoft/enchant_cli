Luo Tian drew his sword and suddenly turned, a drop of heart's blood ignited. His qi surged violently, his body flickered as he rushed toward the Corpse King.

"Kid, you're seeking death!" The Corpse King's heart leaped with joy upon seeing Luo Tian turn. He chased after him, but felt some discomfort on his body.

In his joy, Luo Tian, who had ignited his essence blood, held his sword with both hands and suddenly slashed downward. A crimson blade's radiance split the sky and earth, carrying an overwhelming aura as it slashed toward the Corpse King.

"Is that all you've got?" The Corpse King sneered, extending his hand to grasp the crimson blade's radiance with a claw that had grown massive.

Crack...

Luo Tian's full-force strike was shattered by the Corpse King. Luo Tian's figure reached the Corpse King's side, and he launched a punch toward him.

"Seeking death yourself!" The Corpse King's face twisted with mockery. His massive hand directly grabbed Luo Tian's fist, and a dull sound echoed between their collision.

Luo Tian's face turned pale. His fist felt as if clamped by a vise, unable to move.

With a creaking sound, the Corpse King twisted his hand. Luo Tian's arm instantly contorted, a searing pain wracking his body.

"Open!" On the other side, Luo Tian released his bloodied sword with one hand and clenched a fist that radiated an overwhelming aura. He unleashed two martial arts simultaneously, striking the Corpse King.

Boom...

This time, the Corpse King's body was震退 by Luo Tian. The Corpse King released Luo Tian, his gaze filled with surprise.

"Damn it! If I were at the middle stage of Immortal King, I wouldn't be in this situation!" Luo Tian shook his arm. His wound healed itself. In the brief confrontation, he realized his gap with the Corpse King was still too vast, even after igniting his essence blood.

"Kid, die!" The Corpse King roared. His body vanished from the spot and appeared before Luo Tian, his claw directly aiming for Luo Tian's heart.

Boom...

Luo Tian saw the Corpse King attacking again, showing no regard for him. His hands flew, his body rapidly expanded to thousands of feet.

"Pu..." As Luo Tian's divine form just formed, a green claw pierced through his thigh. Blood splattered, surprising the Corpse King.

Luo Tian took a step forward, initiating the蛮七踏 (Seven Steps of Barbarian), charging toward the Corpse King. His black foot obscured the divine light, and the Corpse King's brows furrowed with a hint of amusement. He raised his fist to meet Luo Tian's蛮七踏.

Boom boom boom...

Seven resounding explosions. Luo Tian took seven steps, but each was blocked by the Corpse King. The Corpse King remained unscathed while Luo Tian's divine form shattered, his body flying backward.

"Done!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. As he flew back, he retrieved the broken sword Zhusan and unleashed a furious aura. His remaining cultivation power surged toward Zhusan.

"Single Sword to Sever the Immortals!" Luo Tian roared mid-flight. The broken sword began to radiate an overwhelming divine light, its aura piercing the heavens.

"嗡..." As Zhusan's radiance erupted, a massive statue in the distance also emitted divine light, converging toward Luo Tian's Zhusan.

"What is this!" The Corpse King's face darkened instantly. He gazed at the distant statue, then shuddered without hesitation, turning and fleeing toward the forest.

Divine sword swept across, its radiance flew forward, instantly appearing behind the Corpse King and slicing into his back. A deep wound appeared on the Corpse King's back, nearly severing him. Yet the Corpse King seemed unaffected, vanishing from the spot.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian didn't understand why the Corpse King suddenly retreated. He was also puzzled by how powerful his "Single Sword to Sever the Immortals" had become.

Chapter 2556: The Divine Hiding Village

Luo Tian's mind was hazy, nearing exhaustion. His body had become emaciated and weak, falling from the sky.

Boom...

His thin body landed on the ground. Luo Tian immediately fainted, too severely wounded. If it weren't for the Corpse King's departure, he would have already died.

Five drops of essence blood, three heart's blood. Now only two heart's blood remained. Luo Tian had reached his limit, his eyes heavy and closed.

As soon as he lost consciousness, two thin figures appeared before him. One was a frail old man, resembling an elderly person on their deathbed.

Beside the old man stood a robust youth. He wore a coarse cotton jacket, revealing strong muscles. His features still carried a touch of naivety, giving an impression of sincerity.

The old man held a bamboo staff and slowly approached Luo Tian. He carefully examined him.

"We haven't seen outsiders in a long time," the old man said.

"Erniu, take him back to the village!" The old man addressed the youth.

"Sure thing!" The youth responded, lifted Luo Tian as if carrying a chicken, and followed the old man toward the direction of the divine light statue.

An elderly man and a youth walked slowly, taking an hour to finally reach the base of the glowing statue.

Below the statue stood a small village. Its buildings were simple, with only several households.

When the old man and youth arrived, they were immediately noticed by the villagers. Six people approached the old man.

"Village Chief, why did you bring an outsider in?" One elder asked, frowning at Erniu's back.

"Don't talk nonsense. Doctor, check if he can be saved!" The village chief addressed an elderly man.

The elder frowned and approached Luo Tian, placing his hand on Luo Tian's wrist. After a while, he withdrew.

"He can be saved."

"Just overexertion and lack of qi. Go to the back mountain to gather herbs, take two doses, and he'll recover!" The doctor said to the village chief.

"Okay, Erniu, go with the doctor to gather herbs!" The village chief said and stepped into a small courtyard.

Erniu followed the village chief inside, placed Luo Tian on a dirt bed, then left with a bamboo basket and an axe.

...

Luo Tian felt utterly exhausted. He couldn't even muster the strength to open his eyes. However, he had regained consciousness upon entering the village and could sense everything around him, including the villagers' conversation.

After three hours, Erniu and the doctor returned. The bamboo basket on Erniu's back was filled with herbs radiating strong vitality.

"These..." Luo Tian marveled. He could sense these herbs were ancient and rare.

The old doctor took out a mortar, placing the herbs inside and pounding them continuously. With each strike of the pestle, waves of vitality spread throughout the room.

"Doctor, will these tonics kill him?" The village chief frowned at the doctor pounding herbs.

"Don't worry. Don't judge by his current state. His foundation is still strong. These herbs won't kill him!" The doctor smiled, continuing to pound the herbs.

"Who are these people?" Luo Tian was shocked. They showed no aura, appearing as ordinary people.

But this place was the Ghost Swamp. Ordinary people couldn't survive here. These frail old and sickly individuals didn't seem capable of surviving.

Moreover, the Corpse King had left, clearly fearing something. It was obviously related to these people.

As Luo Tian pondered, the doctor poured the pounded medicinal liquid into his mouth. Immediately, Luo Tian felt a surge of warmth within his body.

Luo Tian quickly activated his cultivation technique to refine the medicinal liquid. As he refined it, his blood and qi gradually surged, with his blood flow increasing several times.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, a drop of essence blood appeared in Luo Tian's heart, filling him with joy.

With this drop of essence blood, Luo Tian was shocked. Normally, it would take a month to recover.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, regaining some strength. He looked at the people around him with gratitude.

"Look at me, my miraculous healing! One dose and he's fine!" The doctor boasted, his nose almost lifted.

"Thank you all for saving my life!" Luo Tian trembled as he bowed to the villagers. Without their help, he wouldn't have known what would happen.

"Kid? Where are you from? Why did you appear outside our Divine Hiding Village? How did you get involved with that dead man?" As Luo Tian recovered slightly, a series of questions echoed in his ears.

"I am from the Underworld. I am from the Wheel Turning Hall of Yama's Ten Halls!"

"I came here to search for my wife!" Luo Tian answered each question.

Divine Hiding Village!

Luo Tian was puzzled, continuously pondering the records of the Wheel Turning Hall but had never heard of Divine Hiding Village.

"Ah, an outsider!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the elders in the room frowned slightly. They clearly had no good feelings toward outsiders. However, two youths showed a hint of longing.

One youth was Erniu, who had carried Luo Tian back. The other was even more robust and looked similar to Erniu, suggesting they were twins.

There were seven people in the house: five elders and two youths. These were the only residents of the village.

What shocked Luo Tian most was that these twin brothers seemed simple but possessed the strength of an Immortal King's initial stage. Moreover, he sensed these two youths were very young—truly young.

"Only a hundred years old!" Luo Tian felt the two youths were merely a century old but already at the Immortal King's initial stage. He almost gasped.

How many people had never reached the Immortal King realm? Even Luo Tian took three hundred years, and that was because he started from the Daoist Realm with many opportunities.

"These two youths aren't human!" Luo Tian instantly felt a sense of defeat, sighing inwardly.

"Both youths are at the Immortal King's initial stage. What about these elders? What cultivation level do they have?" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, feeling he had entered a village of monsters.

"Little brother, stay here and leave after you recover," the village chief said without further words, leading people out of the old room.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian bowed to the village chief and followed him out. He looked around the room.

The most noticeable feature of the entire village was the towering statue in front. It depicted a middle-aged man, radiating light. As Luo Tian approached the statue closely, he felt an overwhelming pressure.

This statue's hand held a sword. This sword was very familiar to Luo Tian—Zhusan.

Luo Tian was shocked, unsure of the connection between Divine Hiding Village and Zhusan. However, he could guess that this middle-aged man was undoubtedly a powerful figure. Otherwise, these people wouldn't have worshipped him.

Luo Tian's gaze shifted to other places. The village, though old and run-down, had everything appearing unusually ancient. For example, the mill in the village chief's courtyard.

"This must be at least tens of thousands of years old!" Luo Tian was stunned, sensing that every part of this village exuded power.

"We've lived here for generations, guarding our ancestors!" As Luo Tian marveled, the village chief appeared beside him and spoke softly, gazing at the glowing statue.

"Our village's mission is to guard this statue. However, in recent years, our people have dwindled. Some young people couldn't bear the loneliness and left this place, never to return!"

"We're just these old people remaining. We still guard here, waiting for our ancestors' guidance. But we've never received it!" The village chief spoke softly, his voice carrying a hint of sorrow.

"Your ancestors must be a super powerful person!" Luo Tian replied, sitting beside the village chief on a stone table. He was very interested in Divine Hiding Village. If he could take these elders out, he wouldn't fear anyone.

"Correct. He was indeed a super powerful person. The Corpse King you chased here was killed by our ancestor's hand. In this Underworld, many people were sealed by my ancestor!" The village chief smiled proudly upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

An old man and youth sat in the courtyard, continuing their conversation. Luo Tian shared some outside news with the village chief, while the latter recounted Divine Hiding Village's origins.

"Indeed, the outside world has changed so much!" The elder said with a sigh. He had lived in Divine Hiding Village all his life and was unaware of what happened outside. Few people could reach Divine Hiding Village, so it was almost isolated.

Luo Tian was shocked during their conversation. He learned that Divine Hiding Village's ancestor was the ancient sage, Qijue Xiansheng (Seven Absolute Hermit).

Qijue Xiansheng was a peer of Xingtian and one of those who had surrounded and killed him. The sword Zhusan had severed Xingtian's head, and it had broken as well. Its tip flew into the Corpse King's heart, killing him instantly.

After slaying Xingtian, Qijue Xiansheng left Divine Hiding Village for his descendants to guard his statue. They were forbidden from leaving Divine Hiding Village.

Chapter 2557: Secrets of the Divine Hiding Village

"Indeed!" Luo Tian was shocked. He hadn't expected Divine Hiding Village to have such a powerful background.

"Since the Immortal Realm is in turmoil, perhaps your ancestor foresaw this great change and had you stay here!" Luo Tian replied. He felt this possibility was very high.

"Now, only we old men remain. Our lifespans are also nearing their end. After our generation, there will be no one left!" The village chief's eyes showed sorrow. They had once been strong, but time had defeated them.

"Such a pitiful village!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He also admired the perseverance of Divine Hiding Village's people.

After all, they weren't weak. They followed their ancestors' last words and had guarded for countless years.

"Rest well," the village chief said, seeing Luo Tian's shock. He gently shook his head and advised him.

Luo Tian stayed for half a month. During this time, he lived in the village chief's house and learned about him. He hadn't seen Fu Xingyue or Leng Qiuchan, nor had they met Diao Dezhu. He was the first outsider to reach Divine Hiding Village in thousands of years.

...

Green mountains stretched for thousands of feet. The mountain was covered with lush greenery, a rarity in this Underworld and even rarer in the Ghost Swamp.

Three figures walked on the mountain—Luo Tian, Da Niu, and Erniu. After being treated by the doctor in Divine Hiding Village, Luo Tian had recovered significantly. He no longer looked as emaciated.

These twin brothers were the only youths in the village. They handled all tasks.

Their origins were mysterious. The village had no women, only these old men.

The village chief said that two beams of divine light shot from Qijue Xiansheng's statue a hundred years ago, lasting for forty-nine days. After the divine light faded, two infants appeared—Da Niu and Erniu.

The village chief and others raised them. Though they seemed simple-minded, their cultivation speed was astonishingly fast. With the five elders' guidance, Da Niu and Erniu had reached the Immortal King stage within a century.

The elders called them "Sons of God," believing they were Qijue Xiansheng's children. In the hearts of Divine Hiding Village people, Qijue Xiansheng was a god-like figure.

"Senior Tian, do you think the outside world is really that good? I heard Grandpa said many people from our village left," Da Niu asked Luo Tian, constantly questioning him. Erniu was more quiet and rarely spoke.

"Not so good! I still prefer this place!" Luo Tian replied softly, picking a medicinal herb and placing it in Erniu's back basket.

Luo Tian truly liked the life in Divine Hiding Village. The pace was slow, free of deceit and scheming—just simple living.

"Alas... I wonder if the village chief will let us go see outside," Da Niu sighed, having heard many stories about the outside world. Both were curious.

After all, in Divine Hiding Village, their activities were limited to the village and this mountain. They had never gone anywhere else.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly. These people in Divine Hiding Village were powerful, but life outside wasn't suitable for them. They had never experienced deceit and scheming. If they went out, they might be exploited by those with ulterior motives.

The three walked on the mountain. It was full of treasures, medicinal herbs everywhere. The higher they went, the more precious the herbs became, as if divided into levels.

The mountain also had many wild creatures. Though cultivators could fast, the people of Divine Hiding Village still needed to eat and sleep like ordinary people.

They caught a few mountain chickens, gathered some medicinal herbs, then descended the mountain. Upon returning to the village, they saw several elders sitting and chatting.

"Back already?" An old man spoke, wearing patched clothes. His gaze fell on Luo Tian and the two youths. When he saw Luo Tian, his eyes flashed with suspicion.

"Too fake to hide!" Luo Tian chuckled inwardly. These people were too bad at hiding their emotions.

"This is your last dose. After taking it, you can leave. But I advise you not to go deeper. The dangers inside are beyond your imagination!"

"It's better to leave from here," the doctor said, taking the basket from Da Niu and Erniu.

"Thank you all for your hospitality these days. If we meet again, or if you leave Divine Hiding Village, come find me at the Wheel Turning Hall. I'll certainly treat you!" Luo Tian bowed to them, grateful for their help.

"Village Chief, can we go with Senior Tian to see outside?" Da Niu asked. Erniu's eyes also showed hope.

"Ridiculous!" Upon hearing Da Niu's words, the elders' faces darkened instantly.

"What are you two going to do outside? Seek death? The world outside is even more dangerous than the world beyond Divine Hiding Village!" One elder spoke, glaring at Da Niu and Erniu.

"Alas..." The village chief sighed deeply. He spoke softly, "You two really want to go out?"

"Village Chief, let's go together!" Da Niu and Erniu looked at the village chief.

"We're old, with few days left. If you really want to go out, you must pass the test left by our ancestor!" The village chief said, his gaze turning to Luo Tian.

"Village Chief..." Upon hearing the village chief's words, the other elders' faces changed. They didn't know why the village chief wanted Da Niu and Erniu to leave. Their lifespans were short, relying on Da Niu and Erniu to carry their legacy.

"I understand the village chief's intention. He wants me to take these two boys out, but he doesn't fully trust me," Luo Tian thought. He immediately understood the village chief's meaning.

"I, Luo Tian, swear to protect Da Niu and Erniu's safety. If I break this oath, may heaven and earth destroy me!" Luo Tian raised his hand and made a blood vow to reassure the village chief.

No matter the reason, Luo Tian would repay Divine Hiding Village's kindness. After all, they had saved his life, and he truly liked the simplicity of these people.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's oath, the elders showed satisfaction. They then looked at Da Niu and Erniu.

"You two sons are disrespectful! But eaglets must eventually fly. If you face difficulties, return. Divine Hiding Clan may not be as prosperous as before, but if anyone dares to come, we'll send them back without a trace!" One robust elder spoke.

"Yes!" Da Niu and Erniu trembled, their eyes moist. They bowed to the elders.

"Old Five, take them to face the test. Only if they pass will we let them go!" The village chief said to an elder.

Da Niu and Erniu were taken by Old Five. Luo Tian and the village chief remained with four elders.

Luo Tian had lived in Divine Hiding Village for a while. He was nervous, wondering if these people would kill him to prevent Da Niu and Erniu from leaving. They could then use the excuse of not being familiar with the outside to keep them.

Luo Tian was uneasy. Finally, they reached the massive statue. This was Luo Tian's first time being so close to it.

At the base of the statue stood an altar with offerings and three thick incense sticks emitting smoke.

A sense of authority instantly filled Luo Tian. Even the statue made him feel short of breath.

"We've inherited this village since ancient times, naturally possessing many powerful techniques. However, with time passing, our numbers have dwindled. Those powerful techniques are also fewer now!"

"We five old men are too weak to learn some things!"

"Ancestor Qijue Xiansheng had seven techniques, unmatched in the world. The first was the Sword of Annihilation Array that killed Xingtian. Together with the Heavenly Emperor and other strong figures, they severed Xingtian's head!"

"The second was the Formless Divine Technique... The third..." The village chief continued speaking, describing seven techniques. Each was earth-shattering; learning one would bring immense benefits.

"You can choose one to observe. Whether you can learn it depends on your own talent!" The village chief said to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was delighted. He had already grasped some of Xingtian's techniques, like the Heaven-Devouring Eye and Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye. Qijue Xiansheng was a peer of Xingtian, and his techniques were undoubtedly powerful.

"Choose the best one!"

"I choose the Sword of Annihilation Array!" Luo Tian said to the village chief, causing the elders to gasp.

"Brave youth! But I advise you to choose another. This Sword of Annihilation Array is extremely powerful. Since our village's existence, no one has ever mastered it. Not even Da Niu and Erniu could learn it. How can you?" One elder spoke, his face showing disdain.

"No, I have a connection with the Sword of Annihilation. I'll choose it!" Luo Tian shook his head gently. Now, he didn't lack common techniques; what he lacked was a devastating move.

Other techniques of Qijue Xiansheng were strong, but none matched the Sword of Annihilation Array's killing power. Luo Tian decided to try.

"Alright, since you're determined, we won't stop you. Go!" The village chief nodded and waved his hands, imprinting seals onto the sword in the statue's hand.

Divine energy flowed. The long sword in Qijue Xiansheng's hand suddenly radiated brilliant light, a beam of divine light instantly enveloping Luo Tian.

The village chief and elders quickly retreated. They watched the light-covered Luo Tian.

"How can he succeed? The Sword of Annihilation Array requires more people to unleash its full power. If he can master a fraction, it would be beneficial!"

"He's seeking death. Other techniques aren't too dangerous, but this array is risky. If something goes wrong, he'll be harmed by the array," the elders whispered, watching Luo Tian enveloped in divine light.

Chapter 2558: The Sword's Domain

As the divine light enveloped Luo Tian, his surroundings completely changed.

A figure stood in the world, holding a golden long sword. His black hair flowed. In Luo Tian's shock, this figure moved.

The golden long sword radiated divine light, and the figure swung it. Its speed was极致, instantly slicing a blade of light.

The overwhelming sword intent made the world change. As this blade of light soared, the figure appeared in another position, swinging his sword again and creating another blade.

The figure moved like lightning, changing positions constantly. Each blade of light soared into the sky, forming a powerful array with an overwhelming killing intent.

Luo Tian's eyes showed shock. At first, he could still track this figure's position, but as time passed, his eyes became dizzy. Even with his Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye activated, he could only catch glimpses of this figure.

"Three thousand six hundred positions!" Luo Tian exclaimed, rubbing his sore eyes. He looked up at the array radiating destruction.

Luo Tian was shocked to the core. These three thousand six hundred figures, each seemingly perfect, and every blade of light struck with a strong sense of danger.

"Six people are needed to fully unleash the Sword of Annihilation Array's power!" Luo Tian suddenly understood.

He could feel that although this figure was using one person to activate the array, it was still strong. If divided into six people, each activating six hundred blades, the power would be stronger.

"This sword energy is also strange!" Luo Tian was shocked. The array of destruction had fully formed, and this figure's back attacked with a devastating sword array toward Luo Tian.

"It has begun!" The four elders of Divine Hiding Village watched the light-covered Luo Tian. They felt that his surroundings were completely enveloped by overwhelming sword intent, even they couldn't enter.

"This kid if he can't withstand it, he'll be killed by this terrifying sword intent. We can't save him either. Why did he choose the Sword of Annihilation Array instead of something else?"

"Regrettable, my good medicine!" The doctor spoke, his gaze filled with regret.

"It's better this way. It saves us from those two kids going out!" Another elder sneered, not wanting to see their carefully raised children risk their lives.

Meanwhile, the terrifying array had descended. Luo Tian's mind trembled. If a single blade of light hit him, he would be flayed.

Moreover, the terrifying sword intent pressed down on him, making it hard for Luo Tian to breathe. He flickered and vanished from the spot.

As soon as he left, a blade mark appeared on the ground. Luo Tian's mouth twitched.

Luo Tian had no time to think of anything else, as these blades of light continuously attacked him. He activated his Yellow Spring Step to its maximum, leaving countless afterimages in the array.

Pu...

However, even with his speed, these blades of light were densely packed. Even with good movement skills, he couldn't dodge them all.

This was clearly an annihilating array. Xingtian had died in this array, showing how powerful it was.

This array wasn't as strong as when Qijue Xiansheng and the Heavenly Emperor used it, but Luo Tian didn't have Xingtian's strength.

Blood immediately appeared on Luo Tian. The overwhelming sword intent roamed over his wounds, and the sharp blade energy even entered his body.

Luo Tian felt two long dragons continuously moving within his body. If he was careless, it would cause great harm.

He quickly activated his cultivation technique to expel the sword energy. But he was distracted for a moment, and another blade of light struck his chest.

"Damn it!"

"They didn't say this thing could kill people! Those old men tricked me!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. But it was too late to think of other solutions, so he expelled the blade of light again.

The situation gradually became tense. Luo Tian seemed to enter an endless loop, blades of light striking him repeatedly. He expelled the sword intent and was struck again.

The ground was covered with blood marks. The village chief's four elders watched Luo Tian, who was beginning to struggle.

"This kid is truly strong. Da Niu only lasted a quarter of an hour!" The doctor spoke, but still didn't believe in Luo Tian.

They all knew the Sword of Annihilation Array's power. No one had ever mastered it since ancient times. Divine Hiding Village hadn't produced any brilliant individuals, but they were descendants of Qijue Xiansheng. Yet no one had mastered it. This showed how difficult the array was.

"Only those most brilliant in history could achieve this!" The elders whispered, watching Luo Tian still persisting within the array.

"关键时刻, should we intervene? Do we really want to let him die in there?" One elder asked, looking at the village chief.

"Of course we must save him!"

"After all, he brought back the Sword of Annihilation. The day the broken sword is reforged and the Heavenly Emperor returns, this was our ancestor's will!" The village chief said, gazing at Luo Tian.

"It's sword intent!" At this moment, Luo Tian fell into a state. His body instinctively dodged the array.

"I could grasp this sword intent, then I would enter the fourth stage of sword art!"

"I must understand the sword intent before I can't withstand it. Also, I need to master those positions and blade directions I saw!" Luo Tian thought.

Luo Tian continuously understood. His knowledge of sword art was already at the third stage.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian gradually understood some things, but his heart was bitter because the fourth level of sword art—Sword's Domain—was beyond him. His domain was the Cycle of Rebirth Realm.

"Impossible!" Luo Tian thought, stuck in a bottleneck. He didn't know what to do, and his wounds were increasing.

Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye!

Luo Tian roared. His eyes glowed with golden patterns, gazing at the blades of light. He recalled those three thousand six hundred positions.

But even with his talent, he couldn't remember all three thousand six hundred positions in an instant.

"This is too hard. No wonder so many people have never succeeded!" Luo Tian felt bitter. It was simply impossible to achieve.

"He's lasted half an hour already, and hasn't come out. This kid is truly strong!" The village chief's four elders showed surprise, watching Luo Tian shaking his body to dodge the sword intent.

"Our village's longest-lasting record was one hour!" One elder spoke, recalling Divine Hiding Village's records.

As the group marveled, Da Niu and Erniu, along with the strong elder who had taken them, arrived.

"Wow, Luo Tian is challenging the Sword of Annihilation Array!" Da Niu's eyes showed admiration. His face was bruised, obviously their test wasn't easy either. But it wasn't as bizarre as Luo Tian's challenge of the Sword of Annihilation Array.

"Watch carefully. You two have mastered three techniques, but you haven't grasped the Sword of Annihilation Array. If you observe carefully, when your strength reaches a level, you might return to grasp it!" The village chief instructed Da Niu and Erniu.

The group watched as Luo Tian endured the array. As his wounds grew worse, more sword energy filled his body.

"I can't remember!" Luo Tian felt bitter. His body had several blades of light moving within it, and he didn't have time to expel them.

"There must be a way. Qijue Xiansheng and others left this array, they wouldn't want to kill their descendants." Luo Tian thought.

"Wait... could it be!" Luo Tian suddenly had an idea. Normally, no one could remember three thousand six hundred positions at once.

"These blades of light..." Luo Tian had a slight understanding. He took out the broken Sword of Annihilation and activated it, no longer dodging but slicing a blade of light.

Crack...

The collision sound rose in front of Luo Tian. The powerful sword energy directly pushed his body back, landing on the ground.

"It's here!" Luo Tian was happy. Two blades of light appeared in front of him, forcing him to raise his hand to counter them.

The result was Luo Tian coughing blood and being pushed back again. However, he felt delighted because he had understood.

The position where the sword energy pushed him back was the three thousand six hundred positions!

Luo Tian marveled. If it weren't for his Thunder Yang Eye, he wouldn't have remembered dozens of positions. Also, he had spent too long in this array; a short time wouldn't have allowed him to figure it out.

Crack crack crack...

Although he had understood, Luo Tian still endured injuries. However, he felt slightly easier than before.

"One hour has passed!" Seeing Luo Tian hadn't come out yet, the village chief's group showed disbelief.
