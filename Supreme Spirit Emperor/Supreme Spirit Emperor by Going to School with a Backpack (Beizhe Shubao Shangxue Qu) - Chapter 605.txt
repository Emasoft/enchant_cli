"Zhang Ziping, what are you? Get down!" Jiang Kang shouted, as if he had changed into another person. Xiong Qianshan was deeply rooted in the disciplinary hall, but Zhang Ziping wasn't. In his eyes, although Zhang Ziping's strength was equal to his own, he was nothing at all.

"Damn you, Jiang Kang, who are you calling? What are you?" Xiong Qianshan took a step forward with his aura rising, and the people also stood up again, appearing in the center of the hall. A sense of iron blood radiated from them and pressed directly towards Jiang Kang.

"Rebellion, this is a naked rebellion. Where is the discipline of the disciplinary hall?" Jiang Kang immediately got up from his chair, and those still seated also stood up, facing each other with Xiong Qianshan.

"Give me some face. I've been wanting to teach you this bastard a lesson for a long time. Who gave you so much benefit? I've tolerated it before, but now it's come to my brother!" Xiong Qianshan shouted with anger.

"Senior Brother, leave it to me," Zhang Ziping extended his hand and stopped Xiong Qianshan. He knew that if they started fighting, it would escalate. Xiong Qianshan had stood up for them, but they couldn't drag Xiong Qianshan and his people into it.

"Ziping, don't get involved. Today I want to teach these bastards a lesson. What are they?" Xiong Qianshan shouted, his voice filled with anger.

"Don't worry. Senior Brother, trust me. I'll handle it," Zhang Ziping stood in front of Xiong Qianshan and looked deeply into his eyes.

"Good!" Xiong Qianshan frowned, but he still agreed and waved his hand. The people who were tense retreated back.

"That's better. Zhang Ziping, you're smart. Now I command you to personally perform the soul-piercing nail on Luo Tian," Jiang Kang said with a triumphant expression, and he waved his hand to send the soul-piercing nail that had been brought up by the disciple to Zhang Ziping's side.

A seven-inch gray nail, which was not a nail at all. If it pierced someone, they would be nearly dead. Luo Tian felt moved.

"Damn your grandfather!" Just as Jiang Kang's words had barely finished, a cold voice echoed. A wave of fierce coldness instantly froze the entire hall. A flash of cold light appeared, and Zhang Ziping's figure immediately appeared in front of Jiang Kang. He raised his hand and swung the seven-inch gray soul-piercing nail directly towards Jiang Kang's head.

Jiang Kang was a half-step Heavenly King, and there were three other half-step Heavenly Kings by his side. The rest were all peak strength warriors, but they hadn't reacted in time. When they realized it, they had already been hit by the coldness and lost their chance.

"Po..." The gray soul-piercing nail directly pierced into Jiang Kang's head, and a painful scream echoed through the hall.

Jiang Kang immediately dropped to his knees on the ground, convulsing violently. The seven-inch nail almost pierced through Jiang Kang's head.

Everyone was shocked by Zhang Ziping's move. They hadn't expected that he would directly attack, and so ruthlessly, attacking Jiang Kang directly.

"Zhang Ziping, you're looking for death! How dare you defy your superiors!" The people in the hall immediately erupted, surrounding Zhang Ziping instantly.

"Even if I did, what can you do? You don't give us brothers any path to live!" Lei Yong shouted and appeared beside Zhang Ziping like lightning, stepping on Jiang Kang's face. Luo Tian and Ji Chen also appeared with him.

"Stop!" Luo Tian finally spoke, his body filled with demonic energy. He used the Heavenly Path method and instantly enveloped the entire hall, isolating the atmosphere within it.

"Even if I dared to hit the son of Supreme King Bu Tian, do you think I dare not kill you?" Luo Tian sneered and looked at the people in the hall. These people weren't worth his attention, but if he wanted to destroy them, it wouldn't be difficult. The problem was how to escape, but now that Zhang Ziping had already acted, Luo Tian didn't care anymore.

The four brothers each lifted a foot and stepped on Jiang Kang's body, pinning him to the ground. Facing over twenty people, including three half-step Heavenly Kings, they showed no fear at all.

"Zhang Ziping, quickly release the deputy head! Otherwise you will die today!" A half-step Heavenly King shouted at Luo Tian and his group, looking at Jiang Kang who was lying there, convulsing and spitting white foam.

Luo Tian's eyes turned fierce. He extended his hand, and a black pill flew out of it, directly pouring into Jiang Kang's mouth.

"You dare to move? Try!" Zhang Ziping sneered and looked at the half-step Heavenly King who had spoken.

"Ziping, this needs to be planned carefully. Don't act recklessly!" Xiong Qianshan shouted loudly, fearing that Zhang Ziping would get excited and kill Jiang Kang directly, making the situation even worse.

"Dead, why hasn't a Heavenly King elder shown up yet?" The people in Jiang Kang's faction were anxious inside.

"Zhang Ziping, if you don't release Deputy Head Jiang Kang, we will attack!" A half-step Heavenly King shouted loudly with a threat in his voice. However, people could hear a hint of fear in the threatening tone.

At that moment, Zhang Ziping had already made one hundred and eight hand signs with one hand, imprinting them on Jiang Kang's body. He used the Hundred Demons Seal to block Jiang Kang.

"Clap clap clap..." As both sides were about to clash, the sound of clapping echoed through the hall. A figure appeared in the hall, swaying slightly with a strong smell of alcohol.

"Greetings to the head!" Seeing the person, the people in the hall changed their expressions instantly and bowed respectfully.

"Continue. I just came to watch the spectacle!" Jiang Taibai had a rosy face and found a frozen chair, sat down, took another sip of alcohol, and spoke to the people.

...The people looked at Jiang Taibai who was so lazy. They hadn't expected the absentee head to say such a thing, leaving them speechless.

However, although Jiang Taibai said this, no one dared to act. They all stood there and looked at Jiang Taibai waiting for his instructions.

"Continue, it's rare to have such a good show..." Jiang Taibai spoke again with impatience.

"Head, Zhang Ziping attacked Deputy Head Jiang Kang. Please punish him!" A half-step Heavenly King spoke with respect.

"Useless, as a deputy head, he couldn't even beat an elder. What's the point of being a deputy head? How can people trust him? Let him be the deputy head!" Jiang Taibai smiled lightly and spoke carelessly.

"Head, think carefully..." The people in Jiang Kang's faction heard Jiang Taibai's words and had no response.

"Indeed, it needs careful consideration. How about this: the two groups fight a battle. Whoever wins becomes the deputy head, okay?"

"Okay, it's decided so easily!" Jiang Taibai didn't wait for the people to react and immediately made a decision, speaking to Luo Tian and Jiang Kang's group. He took another sip of alcohol as if he were a drunkard, speaking drunken words.

"I say start, start!"

"Start..." Jiang Taibai spoke and made the people in the hall slightly pause. However, someone had already reacted: it was Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian moved instantly and appeared in front of a peak Heavenly King. He punched directly at the man's body.

"Crack..." A crisp sound rose from that middle-aged man, and his body flew back with surprise.

"Boom..." The man's body collided with the walls of the hall covered in ice crystals, and it was then that people regained their senses.

"Kill..." Zhang Ziping's eyes flashed with light, as if he had understood Jiang Taibai's intention. He jumped up and rushed towards a half-step Heavenly King.

Chapter 2289: Sweep the Hall()

In the frozen hall, Luo Tian moved like lightning. His demonic energy was abundant, and he looked like a demon king. Even though the enemy was several times his number, he showed no fear at all. Under the Heavenly Path method's coverage, those who fought against him were suppressed. Zhang Ziping held an ice-like long sword in his hand and was fighting three half-step Heavenly Kings.

"I'll help you!" Tian Fu shouted, his battle spirit rising. He joined the battlefield. He and Zhang Ziping were comrades-in-arms, having lived and died together in Bu Tian City. Their relationship was even closer than that of Xiong Qianshan's group, so he wouldn't stand by idly. They were on the same boat; if Zhang Ziping had problems, Tian Fu wouldn't have a good time in the disciplinary hall either.

With Tian Fu's help, Zhang Ziping felt better. The two of them immediately blocked the three half-step Heavenly Kings without any disadvantage. Tian Fu's big axe swung with wind, and each attack from Zhang Ziping's long sword made the three half-step Heavenly Kings cautious.

"Those who haven't experienced war are just stronger, but they're nothing compared to Ziping and Tian Fu," Xiong Qianshan said with contempt.

"Indeed, but Ziping's strength might have surpassed us!" Another half-step Heavenly King spoke with admiration.

"Just wonder if the head's drunken words count. If they do, I'll support Ziping becoming deputy head. Jiang Kang is really not a good person!" Xiong Qianshan looked at Jiang Kang who was lying on the ground and slowly waking up.

"What's going on?" Jiang Kang looked with fear, looking at Luo Tian and the others fighting. Finally, he saw Jiang Taibai sitting on a chair.

"Head! Please protect me!" Jiang Kang cried and ran to Jiang Taibai's side immediately.

"Protect, protect. I'm letting them fight, aren't I?" Jiang Taibai burped and spoke to Jiang Kang. His eyes looked at the people fighting.

"Eighteen peak Heavenly Kings, eight late-stage Heavenly Kings..." On the other side, Luo Tian, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen were fighting against several times their number of strong opponents.

"However, it's not much of a problem for Ziping and Tian Fu. It might be difficult for Lei Yong and the others, as they are outnumbered!" Xiong Qianshan and others looked at Luo Tian's group.

"Can we go help?" The strong people behind Xiong Qianshan had expressions of eagerness. As elders, they rarely fought, and these people were itching for a fight.

"Can't. It's clearly the head testing Ziping and them. What seemed like drunken words, but the head isn't stupid!" Xiong Qianshan shook his head.

"Second Brother, Third Brother, each of you take one. The rest I'll handle. If you find it too troublesome, just leave them to me!" Luo Tian's eyes were smiling. Even with so many peak Heavenly Kings, he didn't care. Late-stage Heavenly Kings were even more so.

"I'll take two!" Lei Yong sneered, lightning swirling around him. His eyes scanned the people.

"Two!" Ji Chen softly said the two words, and a black dagger appeared in his hand.

"You're picking watermelons. With just the three of you, how do you expect to take down so many people? It's a dream!" A middle-aged man shouted and flew up, rushing towards Lei Yong.

"Kill..." The rest also shouted, their power overwhelming as they rushed toward Luo Tian's group.

Luo Tian moved his hands and enhanced the Heavenly Path method, activating Yellow Spring Steps. He didn't even bother to use his spear or sword and vanished from the spot.

"Boom..." The next moment, Luo Tian appeared in front of a peak Heavenly King. His cold eyes made the middle-aged man hesitate, and his body involuntarily shivered.

When the middle-aged man regained his senses, three fist shadows appeared in his vision. The strength of that opponent's face turned pale immediately.

"Ah..." That opponent had no time to perform anything and could only instinctively raise his fists, clashing with Luo Tian's fist.

"Crack..." However, that opponent's fists were as fragile as dry wood and shattered under Luo Tian's fist. His entire arm turned into a mist of blood, and his body flew back, colliding with the wall of the hall covered in ice crystals.

"Fast!" Everyone's faces showed shock. Luo Tian's speed was too fast; the people hadn't reacted in time.

That peak Heavenly King fell from the wall of the hall, bloodstains on the ice crystal walls. His body was covered with cracks and fell unconscious.

"Good kid! No wonder he could suppress those princes in the Immortal Ruins!" Xiong Qianshan couldn't help but cheer loudly.

"What just happened?" The strong people behind Xiong Qianshan showed intense shock. They were all battle-hardened, but this was the first time they had seen Luo Tian's变态 peak Heavenly King. One punch had left an opponent of the same level severely injured and unable to fight.

"Boom boom boom..." As people were shocked, three peak Heavenly Kings appeared behind Luo Tian. One of them held a long sword and slashed down, while the other two also wielded weapons to strike Luo Tian. The void trembled; a staff, a sword, and a blade sealed all of Luo Tian's escape routes, making people hold their breath again.

Being in the Heavenly Path method, Luo Tian could feel it. He suddenly turned around and his spear, Lietian, appeared in front of the three weapons. The sound of collision echoed, and the three bodies were immediately repelled with shock, quickly retreating using the momentum.

"Suppress!" Before Luo Tian could catch his breath, the remaining strong opponents also launched their attacks. Ten martial arts techniques descended from above, pressing down on Luo Tian. As for the eight late-stage Heavenly Kings, they were already suppressed by the Heavenly Path method and struggled to break free.

Ten martial arts techniques with astonishing power pressed down on Luo Tian. Ten of them were enough to make a half-step Heavenly King fight with all his strength.

The Hellish Ghost Claw extended, and a black demonic claw flew out from the void like a monstrous beast's claw. It rushed toward those ten martial arts techniques.

"Buzz..." A black demonic seal hovered above Luo Tian's head and attacked those martial arts techniques. It was a technique from the Jinghang inheritance.

Boom boom boom...

The thunderous explosion spread in all directions, and the terrifying explosion engulfed Luo Tian, disappearing from people's sight.

"Even if he was stronger, he must have been dead..." A peak strength opponent spoke. Luo Tian's might exceeded their expectations.

But before that peak strength opponent could finish speaking, a black demonic shadow burst out of the explosion. His clothes were slightly disheveled and appeared in front of that peak strength opponent. The dark spear flickered, forming a blur that struck the opponent's chest.

Crack... Another crack echoed. That opponent fell back, his chest caved in, and he spat out a waterfall of blood before collapsing into the corner of the hall.

"Two..." Luo Tian appeared again in people's sight, holding Lietian. His feet pressed the ground, and a heavy sound echoed as he rushed toward the ten people preparing martial arts again.

"Is he even human? Is a half-step Heavenly King his opponent?" Everyone was shocked. Jiang Taibai's eyes showed admiration, then changed to understanding: "No wonder he is the disciple of Gu Tian."

Luo Tian rushed into the group of ten, like a tiger entering a flock of sheep. His fists flew, and those ten people were like dirt and dogs, not daring to fight Luo Tian directly. Although the hall was large, it was too small for people to escape. Occasionally, someone collided with the hall and never got up again. Each one was broken bones and torn muscles. Within half an hour, fourteen people were downed, and the hall was in ruins with bloodstains everywhere, making it shocking.

Luo Tian's battle ended. Lei Yong and Ji Chen's fight was also coming to an end, as their opponents were spitting blood.

"What a peak Heavenly King!" Xiong Qianshan and others stared in disbelief at Luo Tian, looking at the people on the ground. They couldn't believe their eyes and rubbed them.

They had seen one peak Heavenly King fight two, three, or four opponents. But they hadn't seen anyone fight so many and knock them all down.

On the other side, Zhang Ziping and Tian Fu were suppressing three half-step Heavenly Kings. Their bodies were also covered with sword wounds and axe marks.

Luo Tian stood there, observing the situation. His eyes showed battle spirit as he looked at the three half-step Heavenly Kings fighting with Zhang Ziping and spoke loudly: "Senior Brother, let me take one!"

"Good!" Zhang Ziping laughed and swung his ice sword, directly cutting into the chest of a half-step Heavenly King. Blood spewed from that person's chest.

"Boom..." A large axe hit the back of that person, as if swatting a fly. It pushed the half-step Heavenly King towards Luo Tian.

"A half-step Heavenly King!" Luo Tian's eyes showed eagerness. This was his first real face-to-face battle with a half-step Heavenly King.

"Damn!" That half-step Heavenly King stopped his body, coughing up blood. His eyes showed a sense of frustration and looked at Luo Tian.

"You underestimate people!" That person naturally heard what Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping said. He felt insulted, so he flew up again and rushed toward Zhang Ziping.

"Your opponent is me. Although I was injured, it doesn't matter!" But he had barely taken two steps when a cold voice echoed in his ear. A demonic shadow appeared on his path.

"Luo Tian, are you going to fight Xiang Chong?" Seeing Luo Tian blocking that half-step Heavenly King, Xiong Qianshan's face changed again.

"Buzz..." The spear swung, and a black storm swept out, sweeping toward Xiang Chong.

"Go away..." Xiang Chong sneered and swung his big axe, sending a wave of blade slashes colliding with the spear. Sparks flew everywhere as the two storms clashed for several seconds before calming down, revealing Luo Tian and Xiang Chong's figures.

"Unsurpassed! A half-step Heavenly King!" Luo Tian looked at the three knife wounds on his arms and shoulders, looking at Xiang Chong with more caution.

Chapter 2290: Battle Against a Half-Step Heavenly King()

"Die!" Xiang Chong's eyes showed determination. He leaped into the air and rushed toward Luo Tian, his axe expanding.

A powerful slash with overwhelming power. Xiang Chong's face was cold as he slashed out.

"Buzz..." A black demonic sword appeared in Luo Tian's hand. The surrounding air was filled with wild energy, darkening the hall.

"Demonic Eight Directions!" Luo Tian coldly spoke. The Demon Sword of the Abyss erupted, and a black sword beam appeared instantly, colliding with Xiang Chong's blade.

"Crash..." In an instant, the sword beam and the blade collided. Both beams shattered. Luo Tian and Xiang Chong's bodies crossed, standing in the corner of the hall.

The Demon Sword of the Abyss flickered alternately. It emitted an excited aura, and the sword beam rose again. The demonic energy actively escaped from the Demon Sword of the Abyss into Luo Tian's body, restoring his depleted cultivation.

"Good! Good! Good!" Luo Tian was delighted. He hadn't expected the Demon Sword of the Abyss to be so natural, even feeling more convenient than Longyuan.

Xiang Chong's shoulder had a sword wound. Black energy flowed in, and the cold demonic energy entered Xiang Chong's body, beginning to erode him.

"Lightning Slash!" Xiang Chong roared. Golden lightning surrounded his body, purifying the demonic energy in his body and surrounding his axe.

Lightning accumulated. An incredible fluctuation radiated from Xiang Chong's body, and it exploded instantly. Xiang Chong disappeared from the spot, a lightning bolt flashing past Luo Tian's side.

"Danger!" Luo Tian immediately felt danger. His skin prickled, and cold sweat flowed down his forehead.

The Demon Sword of the Abyss was in front of him. A tingling sensation ran up his neck, and a bloodline appeared. Blood flowed down the wound, lightning flowing over Luo Tian's body.

"Kid, do you really think a half-step Heavenly King is so easy to bully?" Xiang Chong appeared behind Luo Tian, breathing heavily and sneering. Obviously, that move had cost him a lot.

Luo Tian touched his cool neck and shook his body. The lightning power was dispersed, and his eyes became deep.

"Interesting! A sudden burst to deliver a killing blow?" Luo Tian wiped the blood on his neck. If the wound had been deeper, he would have died.

"Too勉强 (too difficult), Luo Tian's body could withstand the attack of a peak Heavenly King, but a half-step Heavenly King was one level stronger. Even I would need to use some effort to withstand Xiang Chong's Lightning Slash!" Xiong Qianshan had a worried expression.

However, Jiang Taibai was still quite interested in watching Luo Tian. He wanted to see how Luo Tian would withstand it.

"Rustle... Rustle..." Lightning gathered again on Xiang Chong's body. His eyes showed coldness, and his axe erupted.

Luo Tian narrowed his eyes. His hands moved quickly, and a series of cracking sounds came from his body.

"Demonic Armor!" Black demonic energy covered Luo Tian's body, forming a black demonic armor that completely wrapped him up. Only his eyes were visible. It was another technique from the Jinghang inheritance.

"At this moment, I'll take your life!" At the same time, Xiang Chong's attack came again. It was as fast as lightning, and golden lightning flashed past Luo Tian's front.

"Zhi..." A sharp sound echoed in the hall, making the late-stage Heavenly Kings cover their ears. However, those who were restrained by Luo Tian's Heavenly Path method suffered more; blood flowed from their ears, and they showed painful expressions.

A deep scratch appeared on the black armor. Blood flowed out through the scratch. Xiang Chong's body reappeared, his eyes showing surprise.

"What kind of defense is this?" Xiang Chong couldn't help but exclaim. His attack was clear, and even an upper-grade divine weapon could be cut through. But he hadn't expected that his full power had only penetrated a bit of the demonic armor.

"It's my turn!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed. The Demon Sword of the Abyss emitted a low hum, and he took the Yellow Spring Steps, disappearing from the spot.

The black Demon Sword of the Abyss appeared in front of Xiang Chong, making his face change. He held his axe before him.

The collision sound echoed again. The black sword tip pierced the long axe, and a huge force made Xiang Chong constantly retreat. Luo Tian's body appeared, continuously pushing with strength and forcing Xiang Chong to not breathe.

Xiang Chong's body was pushed back to the edge of the hall.

"Boom..." Xiang Chong's body collided with the wall and finally stopped, but Luo Tian didn't stop. The two of them started to fight with strength.

"Boom..." Luo Tian stomped the ground, shaking the hall. He gripped the Demon Sword of the Abyss and poured his cultivation into it.

"Damn!" Xiang Chong roared. He pushed the axe with both hands, trying to break free and use the wall for leverage to escape Luo Tian's suppression.

"Boom boom boom..." However, every time Xiang Chong took a step forward, he was pushed back by Luo Tian's stronger force. This made Xiang Chong constantly collide with the wall.

"You're not good enough to compare your body strength with my younger brother!" Lei Yong and Ji Chen had already finished their battle. Their faces showed mockery. In the Nine Domains or Bu Tian City, in Lei Yong and Ji Chen's minds, Luo Tian's body strength was superior at the same level. It was also a key factor in Luo Tian's ability to fight above his level.

"Good kid!" On the other side, Tian Fu also shouted. The remaining half-step Heavenly King made it much easier for Tian Fu. If it weren't for Zhang Ziping not allowing him to end the battle, Tian Fu would have already finished it.

Zhang Ziping was also like this. Their opponents were now weak and about to give up, but Zhang Ziping's purpose was to let Luo Tian finish first. Zhang Ziping had a lot of experience in cultivating Luo Tian and knew that Luo Tian had just ascended to peak Heavenly King. He needed opponents to test his strength and stabilize his cultivation. If they finished their battle, Xiang Chong would have no chance at all. Xiang Chong might even surrender.

"Roar..." Xiang Chong growled, golden lightning continuously radiating out. It began to gather and formed a hundred-foot thunder image, striking Luo Tian's fist.

Luo Tian smiled lightly. His body emitted a series of booming sounds. Eight ghost channels filled with demonic energy burst out, forming a black demon image and striking the thunder fist.

"Boom..." The fierce gust of wind swept over, and both images collided. However, the Demon Sword of the Abyss was still nailed into Xiang Chong's long axe.

"Damn, this isn't enough. Do I have to be seriously injured?" Xiang Chong's face was grim. The thunder image had consumed a lot, and the previous Lightning Slash had also taken a toll. At this point, Xiang Chong's Heavenly King energy was almost gone.

"Is he really a peak Heavenly King? How does he have so much demonic energy? Doesn't it worry about the consumption?" Xiang Chong looked at that demon image, and his heart was filled with waves.

"Crack..." While Xiang Chong was thinking, the axe in his hand had some cracks.

"What kind of sword is this..." At that moment, Xiang Chong noticed the Demon Sword of the Abyss in Luo Tian's hand. It was definitely not an upper-grade divine weapon.

"Give it all!" Xiang Chong couldn't let his axe be destroyed, or he would have no chance of winning.

After thinking, Xiang Chong suddenly stopped resisting and quickly moved to the side. However, Luo Tian's great strength continued to push forward, directly piercing Xiang Chong.

"Po..." Xiang Chong's speed was fast, but he still got pierced by the Demon Sword of the Abyss. The sword pierced into Xiang Chong's shoulder, pinning him to the wall of the hall.

Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly. He immediately lifted his fist and smashed it towards Xiang Chong.

"Ah..." In a flash, Xiang Chong roared and still fell to the side. Blood flowed from Xiang Chong's shoulder.

The Demon Sword of the Abyss cut through Xiang Chong's shoulder. The thunder image collapsed, and Xiang Chong's body appeared in the distance. A fierce wound appeared on Xiang Chong's shoulder, and his left arm hung down as if it could fall off at any moment.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's fist also smashed into the frozen wall, causing the entire hall to tremble violently. Ice chips flew everywhere.

"Xiang Chong cut off his own arm to escape!" Xiong Qianshan looked at Luo Tian in the black demon image and couldn't help but exclaim.

A sound of drawing cold air echoed through the hall. To fight a half-step Heavenly King as a peak Heavenly King and reach this point, they had never seen it before.

"Lightning Slash..." Xiang Chong growled and disappeared from the spot again. Lightning flashed, and the black demon image collapsed. The part of Luo Tian's armor on his neck cracked again. This time, it didn't hurt Luo Tian's neck.

"There's no new tricks this time? How are you going to block it?" The black armor restored itself. Luo Tian's cold voice echoed again, and his figure appeared in front of Xiang Chong. The Demon Sword of the Abyss was thrust out again.

"Again!" Xiang Chong saw the Demon Sword of the Abyss approaching him. His heart clenched tightly. He raised his axe again, but this time he didn't fight with Luo Tian directly. After colliding once, his body turned around and fell to the side.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian didn't stop. His other hand punched, striking Xiang Chong and knocking off his arm that was about to fall.

"Ah..." The extreme pain made Xiang Chong scream. Sweat flowed out, but Luo Tian didn't give him a chance. He swung his sword and swept it towards Xiang Chong.

"Crack..." The axe collided with the black long sword again. However, Xiang Chong's face turned pale suddenly. His entire body was knocked back.

"Changed the sword!" People exclaimed, watching Luo Tian's Demon Sword of the Abyss disappear and instead appear on his back as Longyuan.

Longyuan was heavy, and combined with Luo Tian's body strength. It was definitely not something Xiang Chong could handle after being injured. Xiang Chong hadn't expected Luo Tian to suddenly change his sword, and he had suffered a disadvantage.

Chapter 2291: Change of Power()

"Boom..." Xiang Chong fell to the ground in a messy manner. Before he could get up, the black long sword was already close by. Luo Tian's cold eyes appeared in Xiang Chong's vision.

"Don't move!" The tip of the black sword pointed at Xiang Chong. Luo Tian looked down on Xiang Chong with a cold expression, and the cold air made Xiang Chong shiver involuntarily.

"Defeated... Xiang Chong was defeated!" Xiong Qianshan and others showed disbelief. Although they had prepared for it, they still couldn't help but exclaim. The record of a peak Heavenly King defeating a half-step Heavenly King was truly terrifying.

"Haha, this kid really isn't the same as before!" Tian Fu laughed and swung his axe. He hit a half-step Heavenly King he was fighting, knocking him to the ground and making him never rise again.

A block of ice fell from the sky, appearing in people's sight. His eyes were full of fear. It was a half-step Heavenly King who had fought with Zhang Ziping.

"This..." Jiang Kang looked at the twenty people lying on the ground, his eyes full of fear. He had never considered Zhang Ziping as anything before. Now he realized how terrifying Zhang Ziping was, defeating his entire team with six people.

"Zhang Ziping, you dare to do this. This is the disciplinary hall. You are attacking your colleagues here. This is a rebellion against the sect! Head, please take action and capture these traitors of the sect!" Jiang Kang shouted loudly and ran to Jiang Taibai's side. His voice was full of urgency.

"Ha..." Jiang Taibai yawned and had a strong smell of alcohol. He lazily got up from his chair.

As Jiang Taibai stood up, the ice in the hall began to retreat. The messy things also started to restore. Everyone's eyes were focused on Jiang Taibai.

"Everyone sit down!" Jiang Taibai smiled lightly, as if he hadn't seen the injured people. He spoke to Xiong Qianshan and others.

"Yes..." Xiong Qianshan and others stood there, their eyes showing a bit of excitement. They took the lead and stepped onto the chairs.

"Alright, since the result is clear, the new deputy head is Zhang Ziping!" As Xiong Qianshan and others sat down, Jiang Taibai spoke lazily. However, this made everyone stand up again instantly.

"What!" Jiang Kang was like being struck by lightning. He fell to the ground again, his eyes full of disbelief. He hadn't known what Jiang Taibai had said because he was unconscious.

Jiang Kang stood there in a daze, looking at Jiang Taibai. He hadn't expected that after just being unconscious for a while, his deputy head position was gone.

"Head, what do you mean? My family has served the Jiang family for generations. I have worked diligently these years, and you took away my position as deputy head? I don't accept it! Why!" Jiang Kang shouted, his voice full of anger. He looked at Jiang Taibai as if he were mad.

"Smack..." However, before Jiang Kang's words had finished, a big hand struck his face. It knocked him flying and hit the wall of the hall.

"You don't accept it? Questioning my authority?" Jiang Taibai's face showed a smile. He looked at Jiang Kang, and his whole demeanor changed. No longer lazy, he radiated a sense of iron blood and coldness, making everyone in the hall shiver.

"Five decades ago, a disciple of Bu Tian Mountain forcibly took a girl from the middle three realms and even destroyed her family. This incident was reported to the disciplinary hall, but why did they only punish him with cleaning Bu Tian Pavilion?"

"Thirty years ago, a brother killed thirty thousand people and left no survivors. This incident was reported to the disciplinary hall, but why did they only punish him with three months of resources?" Jiang Taibai continued to speak, recounting one incident after another. This made Jiang Kang's face pale.

"Smack..." Jiang Taibai extended his hand and slapped a jade slip onto the table. The jade slip opened, revealing countless small characters on it. Although the script was small, everyone in the hall could see them clearly.

Crimes, all crimes. The slip recorded every bribe and incident Jiang Kang had received over the past fifty years, very detailed. Cold sweat immediately flowed down Jiang Kang's face. He fell to his knees on the ground, eyes full of fear, looking at Jiang Taibai.

"If you hadn't crossed the line, I would have turned a blind eye. You really think I'm not here at Bu Tian Mountain and that you can do whatever you want in the disciplinary hall?"

"What crime do you yourself know? I don't need to explain it!" Jiang Taibai spoke coldly, looking at Jiang Kang.

"Mercy! Master, mercy!" Jiang Kang was so scared he urinated and defecated. He fell to his knees in front of Jiang Taibai, shouting for mercy. This would really cost him his life.

"How can I show mercy to you?" Jiang Taibai's face showed a cold smile. He extended his hand and a golden dragon of light wrapped around Jiang Kang, binding him.

"Boom..." A heavy sound rose from Jiang Kang's dantian. A gust of wind swept through, forming a wave that blew the clothes of everyone.

"My cultivation..." Jiang Kang's face turned completely grim. He looked at Jiang Taibai, his aura was very weak.

"Considering you are from the Jiang family, I'll spare your life. Go back to the Jiang family yourself!" Jiang Taibai spoke lightly. A half-step Heavenly King was not easy to cultivate in Bu Tian Mountain.

"Also, you who have assisted in wrongdoing over the years. What crime do you have? I know it well, but these will be handed over to the deputy head. From today on, Zhang Ziping is the new deputy head. Is there anyone who doesn't accept it?" Jiang Taibai spoke to the people in the hall.

"No!" A unified voice echoed. Xiong Qianshan and others showed excitement in their eyes. They didn't feel any resentment towards Zhang Ziping becoming the deputy head. These years they had been very frustrated, and they trusted Zhang Ziping. He wouldn't be like Jiang Kang.

"The rest is up to you!" Jiang Taibai smiled and looked at Zhang Ziping. He slowly stepped forward, returning to his drunkard-like demeanor.

"Congratulations, Ziping! You've been promoted. From now on, you must take care of your brothers more!" Xiong Qianshan and others laughed loudly and came to Zhang Ziping's side.

"This matter, if you don't invite us for a drink, it won't be convincing, Deputy Head!" Others also joined in the teasing. The hall became lively again.

Luo Tian looked at Jiang Taibai leaving the hall and remembered something. He quickly ran out of the hall, chasing after Jiang Taibai.
