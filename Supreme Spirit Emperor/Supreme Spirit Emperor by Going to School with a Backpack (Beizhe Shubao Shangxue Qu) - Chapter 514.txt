Lu Zhong's strength was formidable; he was the foremost artificer of the Immortal Realm, with a network of connections spanning the Nine Sacred Mountains. Even the leaders of these mountains occasionally deferred to his authority.

To become Lu Zhong's disciple was tantamount to securing an unbounded future. Save for Jiang Huantian, the other sect elders longed to replace Luo Tian and his companions.

As Lu Zhong awaited the trio's prostration and address of him as master, Luo Tian and his companions merely gaped at Lu Zhong in bewilderment.

"Uh... Master, we didn't come to pay homage. We have a request for you!" Luo Tian spoke up, his mind still reeling from the impact of Lu Zhong's hammer technique. Yet he had no intention of pledging himself.

"Ahem..." Lu Zhong was so taken aback by Luo Tian's words that he coughed violently, his breath labored as he fixed a glare upon the youth.

"Rejection?" Jiang Huantian and his companions' lips twitched. They had not anticipated such a response from Luo Tian.

"Big guy, become my disciple! I'll pass on all my skills!" Lu Zhong ignored Luo Tian and directly addressed Chen Zhanbiao, the one he favored most among the trio.

Chapter 1976: These Three Are Insane

"Are these three mad?" The onlookers regarded Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao with suspicion. To be chosen by Lu Zhong was a fortune many would kill for, yet these three had not refused outright. Instead, they claimed their purpose was not to seek discipleship.

"I follow my elder brother's orders. Where he goes, I go!" Chen Zhanbiao declared, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

"Kid, what do you need from me? I won't agree to anything. If you wish my acceptance, then you must pledge yourselves as disciples!" Lu Zhong turned to Luo Tian.

"Damn..." Luo Tian cursed inwardly, yet his expression remained respectful as he addressed Lu Zhong. "Master, we do have a request. But if you intend to coerce us into discipleship over this matter, it would be beneath your dignity."

Luo Tian understood that joining Lu Zhong's sect would unlock boundless potential. Though artificers were not as revered as alchemists, mastery of any craft could lead to greatness. Luo Tian had already mastered alchemy; adding artificery would risk diluting his focus. He preferred alchemy, for he had already mastered its fundamentals. Artificery would require starting anew.

Luo Tian's hope was for Chen Zhanbiao to become Lu Zhong's disciple. The latter appeared formidable, his flesh strength ideal for Chen Zhanbiao. Yet Luo Tian hesitated. He knew nothing of Lu Zhong's character, nor that of the middle-aged man and youth accompanying him. If Chen Zhanbiao remained, would they scheme against him?

Luo Tian needed to verify Lu Zhong's integrity and that of his companions. If this man were a fire master, he would have surrendered Chen Zhanbiao without hesitation—especially with Meng Xue by his side. He knew Meng Xue's nature; she would never betray them.

But Lu Zhong was different. Luo Tian would rather Chen Zhanbiao miss a suitable teacher than risk him in unknown peril. He could not gamble.

"You... you infuriate me!" Lu Zhong's face reddened, his breath ragged. Yet he did not strike, instead turning to Chen Zhanbiao with a smile.

"Big guy, why obey others? Become my disciple! I'll introduce you to the Nine Sacred Mountains!"

"I follow my elder brother's orders!"

"I'll make your flesh stronger!"

"I follow my elder brother's orders..."

"Ugh... I'm furious! I'm furious!" Lu Zhong roared, his aura surging. His crimson eyes burned with intensity.

No matter how Lu Zhong tempted Chen Zhanbiao, the latter only repeated one phrase. Frustrated, Lu Zhong abandoned enticement and resorted to threats.

"If you refuse, I'll kill your elder brother!"

"You dare!"

"I'll tear you apart!" Chen Zhanbiao's eyes flared red, his body bristling with fury. He charged at Lu Zhong despite the overwhelming pressure.

"Unshackled from an Immortal King's aura!" Jiang Huantian and the others gaped in disbelief. Even they felt the tremors of Lu Zhong's power, yet Chen Zhanbiao, a mere Celestial Peak, had not been crushed. Instead, he lunged forward.

"Roar!" Chen Zhanbiao's bellow echoed as his massive fist hurtled toward Lu Zhong.

"Good!" Lu Zhong's eyes gleamed as he countered with a punch. His gaunt fist met Chen Zhanbiao's massive one.

"Crack!" The collision sent Chen Zhanbiao flying backward, landing in a heap.

"Fool! You possess immense strength but lack strategy. You fight with brute force alone!" Lu Zhong chided.

"Ah..." Chen Zhanbiao rose, charging again. His body's thunderous impact struck Lu Zhong.

"Boom!" Yet the result remained unchanged. Chen Zhanbiao was repelled again.

Luo Tian watched without intervening, knowing Lu Zhong had not drawn blood. If he had, even the three of them combined could not match a single strike from Lu Zhong.

Luo Tian surmised that Lu Zhong was testing Chen Zhanbiao's talent, offering guidance on his shortcomings. Meng Xue and he were equally stunned by Lu Zhong's words, realizing their own flesh strength was akin to Chen Zhanbiao's—raw power without refinement.

Luo Tian had once wielded the King-Subjugating Martial Art, but since entering the Immortal Realm, its power had waned. Techniques like "One Strike to Shatter All" no longer suited his growth.

"Roar!" Chen Zhanbiao's relentless assaults continued, each time repelled by Lu Zhong's effortless strikes.

"Body strength can be transformed into speed or explosive power. You fight like a mindless brute!" Lu Zhong's words resonated with Luo Tian and Meng Xue, who pondered his advice.

Yet Chen Zhanbiao remained oblivious, fixated on destroying the man who had sought to kill Luo Tian. Gradually, he entered a trance-like state.

"Buzz..." At last, Chen Zhanbiao closed his eyes. His blood surged, and he stood motionless, howling toward the heavens. His aura soared to near-Immortal King levels.

"What's happening?" Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, surprise flickering. He recognized Chen Zhanbiao's state—True Unity with Heaven—but this manifestation was unprecedented.

"So easily entering True Unity... and even feral transformation!" Lu Zhong exclaimed, his first hint of awe. He was now certain: Chen Zhanbiao was destined to be his disciple.

"Roar!" Chen Zhanbiao's body expanded, his robes torn. A destructive force emanated from him, yet he did not transform into a giant. Yet this state made Luo Tian feel more terrifying than when Chen Zhanbiao had become a giant.

"Boom!" A thunderous sound erupted beneath Chen Zhanbiao as he became a blur, charging at Lu Zhong.

"Zhanbiao!" Luo Tian shouted, but Chen Zhanbiao ignored him, his mind consumed by fury.

"Boom!" Despite his enhanced strength, Chen Zhanbiao was no match for Lu Zhong. His power gap was too vast.

"Boom!" Chen Zhanbiao's body flew backward again, yet he rose instantly to charge once more.

"Is this even human?"

"No wonder Master Lu wanted him as a disciple! His talent rivals Luo Tian's!" Jiang Huantian marveled, watching Chen Zhanbiao's relentless attacks.

"If anything happens to Zhanbiao, I'll kill you!" Luo Tian's eyes burned with madness.

He raised his hand, two black spheres materializing in his grasp. A frigid chill radiated from them.

"Those are!" Jiang Huantian gasped, his gaze fixed on the spheres.

"Ghost Qi!" The sect elders' faces paled. That chill sent shivers down their spines.

These two black spheres were the ones that had once been embedded in Luo Tian's body. He had extracted them and kept them, now his strongest weapon. Merging the two spheres allowed him to instantly reach True Immortal Mid-stage, though it was still insufficient. Yet he had the Epoch Book; if activated, even Lu Zhong would face peril. This was Luo Tian's ultimate secret.

"Kid, stop! I promise he'll be fine—only benefit!" Lu Zhong's brow furrowed as he saw Luo Tian pressing the spheres to his forehead. He shouted.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's brow furrowed, halting his action but keeping the spheres in hand. If anything happened to Chen Zhanbiao, he would fight Lu Zhong without hesitation.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The thunderous clashes continued as Chen Zhanbiao relentlessly attacked Lu Zhong. His strength seemed inexhaustible.

After an hour, Chen Zhanbiao finally showed signs of fatigue. His strength and speed waned.

"Boom!" His massive body collapsed, eyes closed, breathing heavy as if asleep. Yet his body radiated waves of energy, absorbing the surrounding spiritual essence.

"I told you he'd be fine. Only benefit!" Lu Zhong smiled, approaching Chen Zhanbiao and injecting a pulse into his body. The absorption intensified.

"Kid, let him be my disciple. I'm certain he'll reach Immortal King within a century!" Lu Zhong turned to Luo Tian.

"Century to become an Immortal King!" Jiang Huantian and the others inhaled sharply, their gazes fixed on Lu Zhong.

Immortal King was a threshold in the Immortal Realm. True Immortals could ascend, but Immortal Kings were formidable—capable of moving mountains and breaking voids.

"I'll consider it," Luo Tian sighed, his voice heavy. Though Chen Zhanbiao's battle had not ended with Lu Zhong's strike, the latter had guided him. This convinced Luo Tian of Lu Zhong's genuine intent.

Chapter 1977: You Damn Fool

"Still considering?" Jiang Huantian's lips twitched. He could not fathom what Luo Tian was thinking.

"You..." Lu Zhong's beard bristled, his breath labored as he glared at Luo Tian. What was this kid up to?

"What conditions do you have? Speak freely!" Lu Zhong bellowed. He was so enamored with Chen Zhanbiao that he saw him as the perfect heir, a vessel to inherit his artificery.

"Master must swear not to harm Zhanbiao, not to let him suffer..." Luo Tian pondered before listing his conditions—each one favoring Chen Zhanbiao.

"Is that all?" Lu Zhong blinked, confusion etched on his face.

"You damned fool!" Lu Zhong erupted, slapping Luo Tian's head. To him, a master protecting his disciple was natural. Luo Tian's conditions were trivial; he had even groveled for acceptance.

"I swear, whoever harbors ill intent toward Chen Zhanbiao shall be destroyed. Whoever harms him shall be my eternal enemy!" Lu Zhong roared, and the sky trembled as divine oaths descended.

"Divine Oath!" Jiang Huantian's face paled. This oath surpassed blood oaths, binding even Immortal Kings.

"I accept," Luo Tian nodded, satisfaction in his eyes. He understood Lu Zhong's intent.

"You're questioning my integrity!" Lu Zhong glared at Luo Tian, anger in his eyes. He knew what Luo Tian was thinking.

"Respectfully, I dare not. My brother and Zhanbiao are like brothers. His nature is pure, easily manipulated. I fear he may face trouble," Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his gaze apologetic.

"Kid, take me as your disciple too. I'll ensure you reach Immortal King within a century!" Lu Zhong, hearing Luo Tian's words, was not angered but impressed.

"Thank you for your kindness. I am already an alchemist with a master, Master," Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao's slumbering form. His eyes softened.

Chen Zhanbiao had followed him since their days in the Southern Region of Tianyuan. To part with him was painful, but Luo Tian knew who suited Chen Zhanbiao better than himself. Yet he also understood that everyone must walk their own path. Keeping Chen Zhanbiao by his side would be unfair.

Like Sun Kedian and Sima Tuo, they had chosen to part from Luo Tian. They knew their paths diverged. In Luo Tian's presence, their cultivation suffered. Brothers need not be together constantly; they must support each other in times of need, ensuring mutual safety.

"Alchemy? Why not artificery with me?" Lu Zhong scoffed. Artificers were less esteemed than alchemists in the Immortal Realm, a fact that irked him.

"Take it or leave it!"

"Little girl, want to be my disciple?" Lu Zhong abandoned pressing Luo Tian. He knew artificery and alchemy together might hinder perfection.

"Accept!" Meng Xue wasted no words, bowing to Lu Zhong in拜师 (initiation).

Meng Xue had no master, so she had no reservations. She understood Luo Tian's concern—remaining would let him rest easy about Chen Zhanbiao.

"Good, good, good!"

"I'll never favor one over another," Lu Zhong laughed, lifting Meng Xue. His eyes glowed with joy; her talent was commendable.

"These are your brothers, Master," Lu Zhong introduced the middle-aged man and youth to Meng Xue. "Master Lujiushan, Master Luxinshui. From now on, we're family!"

"Senior Sister," Lujiushan and Luxinshui greeted Meng Xue, smiling.

"Congratulations, Master Lu! You've gained two disciples!"

"This is a token of respect. Please don't refuse," the sect elders hurriedly offered gifts, seizing Lu Zhong's good mood.

"Ha! Thank you. I'll accept these on their behalf. Today, I'm in a good mood. Your request is granted. Leave the items here; I'll inform you when they're ready. Don't reveal my whereabouts!" Lu Zhong laughed, accepting the gifts and promising.

"Thank you, Master Lu! I wish to forge a mid-grade immortal weapon—a long sword. Here are the materials: Zhenxian Stone!" A senior offered a storage bag.

Others followed, presenting bags with items that made Luo Tian's heart race. He hadn't realized artificery was so sought after.

"Enough. Return," Lu Zhong collected the bags, indifferent—this was common.

"Yes, thank you, Master Lu!" The sect elders nodded eagerly, exiting the courtyard.

"Kid, you said you had a request? What is it?" Lu Zhong turned to Luo Tian, his gaze still annoyed from earlier.

He noticed Luo Tian's evasion. The latter had not revealed the request, implying it was meant for no one else.

"Master, I've obtained the Shouri Bow. Please honor your promise and reattach its string," Luo Tian spoke softly, summoning the black Shouri Bow.

"Ah?" Lu Zhong's eyes gleamed with amusement. Though reclusive, he was aware of recent events in the Central Three Realms.

"Is it him?" Lujiushan and Luxinshui's faces showed surprise.

"Kid, you're bold. But what string did you find? Don't try to trick me with trash. I won't accept it. My creations aren't for scraps!" Lu Zhong's face was cold.

"A dragon sinew from an Immortal King!" Luo Tian replied softly, as if trivial. He waved his hand, golden light erupting.

"Roar!" A golden dragon soared skyward. Though dead, the sinew still bore residual soul fragments, radiating immense draconic power.

"Recently deceased. It still has a spark of life and residual soul!" Lu Zhong's face shifted, his gaze now different.

"Who killed an Immortal King dragon?" Jiang Huantian's face changed. He wondered how Luo Tian obtained the sinew.

"Good!"

Lu Zhong roared, his eyes alight with joy. He seized the sinew.

"With this, I may attempt to forge the Shouri Bow into an ultimate-grade immortal weapon!" Lu Zhong spoke softly, causing everyone to hold their breath.

Ultimate-grade weapons were rare in the Immortal Realm. Only the Nine Sacred Mountains possessed them. The Central Three Realms' sects had mid-grade weapons at best, but none had ultimate-grade ones. Perhaps one sect did, but they wouldn't reveal it—such was their secret strength.

"Only an attempt. Success is uncertain, but a mid-grade weapon is certain," Lu Zhong said.

"Master, I have another weapon. Please examine it to see if it can be upgraded to mid-grade. If so, I'll pay any price," Luo Tian said, summoning the Rupture Spear.

"Rubbish..." Lu Zhong was about to scold Luo Tian for throwing trash at him, but he stopped mid-sentence.

"A weapon with a self-generated soul?" Lu Zhong's eyes darkened. He took the spear, sensing its essence.

"Though the soul isn't fully formed, if it matures..." Lu Zhong didn't finish, his eyes alight with excitement.

"Kid, go burn incense. This spear found me!" Lu Zhong told Luo Tian, his voice still excited.

"This spear is currently a low-grade immortal weapon. If handled properly, its soul will mature—surely becoming an ultimate-grade one!" Lu Zhong said, making Luo Tian's eyes gleam with joy.

"Master, I have another artifact with a fully formed soul. Please examine it," Luo Tian said, recalling the long-forgotten Yin Fish.

"Another?" Lu Zhong's breath quickened. He had forged countless weapons, even ultimate-grade ones. But those souls were forcibly embedded. He knew self-generated souls differed greatly from forced ones.

"Buzz..." A black glow flickered as Luo Tian waved his hand, summoning the Yin Fish.

"Lu Tian, you damn fool! You ungrateful bastard. Are you trying to kill me? I can't withstand this!" The Yin Fish's soul voice rang out, making Luo Tian's lips twitch.

Chapter 1978: Frenzied Wind Hammer Technique

A string of curses echoed in the courtyard, making Luo Tian and Lu Zhong's faces grim. Especially Luo Tian, who felt awkward.

"Master, Master... this time it's not tricking you. Truly!" Luo Tian hurriedly spoke, trying to stop the Yin Fish soul but failing.

"You little bastard. I protected you from countless calamities. You arrive in the Immortal Realm and forget me, only caring for that broken spear..." The Yin Fish soul interrupted Luo Tian, ranting for a quarter-hour before realizing it was tired and stopped.

"Uh... Master Lu, how about this? Can you upgrade it?" Luo Tian awkwardly looked at Lu Zhong.

"It's possible, but must you make it stronger? Fear it won't devour you?" Lu Zhong looked at the Yin Fish atop Luo Tian's head, speechless.

"Don't fear. Please, Master Lu. Whatever you need, I'll do my best to gather!" Luo Tian smiled.

Though the Yin Fish soul's words were harsh, they were justified. It had aided Luo Tian greatly in the Nine Realms, even saving his life on several occasions. Making it stronger was Luo Tian's way of repaying the favor.

"No need. I have materials here. Consider it payment for bringing me Zhanbiao and Xue as disciples!" Lu Zhong shook his head, knowing Luo Tian lacked resources.

"Thank you, Master. My alchemy is decent. If you need anything, I can forge a few batches of elixirs for you," Luo Tian quickly offered.

"Strengthening?"

"You have some heart after all!" The Yin Fish's satisfied voice echoed, as if transformed.

"Buzz..." As they conversed, the suction from Chen Zhanbiao vanished. He slowly opened his eyes, confusion in them as he stood up.

"Hey... I feel stronger?" Chen Zhanbiao looked at his massive hands, speaking in bewilderment.

"Old man, you're dead!" But Chen Zhanbiao saw the smiling faces of everyone and Lu Zhong. His expression changed, readying to fight again.

"Zhanbiao, come back! We're allies!" Luo Tian smiled, his gaze gentle.

"Huh?" Chen Zhanbiao stopped, confusion in his eyes as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Zhanbiao, from today, Master Lu is your master. His words are as mine. You must obey Master Lu's teachings! Understood?" Luo Tian directly addressed Chen Zhanbiao.

"Uh... what?" Chen Zhanbiao's face showed disbelief. He couldn't grasp how after fighting so fiercely, Luo Tian now had him pledge to Lu Zhong.

"Big brother, are you playing with me?" Chen Zhanbiao looked at Luo Tian, bewildered.

"No. From today, Master Lu is your master. You must learn under his guidance. Understood?" Luo Tian spoke softly, sighing deeply with a hint of reluctance.

"Big brother, will you?"

"You don't want to get rid of me? Big brother, I can eat a little. But I promise to eat less!" Chen Zhanbiao understood Luo Tian's intent upon hearing his earnestness. He realized Luo Tian was sending him away to Lu Zhong, despite their earlier fight.

Hearing Chen Zhanbiao's words, Luo Tian felt a pang of sorrow but continued persuading. He knew Chen Zhanbiao's stubbornness; if he dug in his heels, even Luo Tian and Xu Liyi would need time to convince him.

"Master Lu is strong?"

"He is!"

"Do you want to be as strong as him?"

"You do!"

"Then learn under Master Lu's guidance. In the future, help me defeat enemies. My enemies are far stronger than Master Lu!" Luo Tian persisted, eventually convincing Chen Zhanbiao.

"Old man, I follow my elder brother's orders. From today, you are my master. My elder brother told me to obey you, so I will!"

"Master, I pay my respects! Three bows!" Chen Zhanbiao said nothing more, kneeling and bowing thrice.

"Good disciple, rise! Rise!" Lu Zhong's mouth stretched to his ears. He lifted Chen Zhanbiao, loving him more with each glance.

"These are your gifts!" Lu Zhong laughed, waving his hand. Treasures appeared before them.

"Entirely armor!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed. These items were of high grade, including two mid-grade immortal weapons that could fully arm Meng Xue and Chen Zhanbiao.

Even Luo Tian was tempted. So many items equaled another life—unless one was a True Immortal Peak, they couldn't break through this armor.

"Master, do you need more disciples? I have no master either!" Diao Dezhu stood on Luo Tian's shoulder, addressing Lu Zhong.

"You're not suitable!" Lu Zhong shook his head. Then he looked at Luo Tian: "Kid, reconsider. Focusing on artificery is better than alchemy!"

"Thank you for your kindness, Master," Luo Tian declined gently. Though tempting, he preferred alchemy.

"Fine, Jiang kid, do you have anything to forge? Today I'm in a good mood. I'll take it all!" Lu Zhong addressed Jiang Huantian.

"Thank you, Master. I'll send the materials later!" Jiang Huantian's face lit up. Having Lu Zhong forge items was a dream for others; he had never seen Lu Zhong offer help. This opportunity was too good to miss, and he felt his decision to bring Luo Tian and others had been wise.

"Enough. Rest," Lu Zhong smiled, addressing the middle-aged man. "Lujiushan, prepare a room for Luo Tian. Once I've refined his items, he can leave!"

Luo Tian did not refuse. The Rupture Spear, Yin Fish, and Shouri Bow were life-saving tools in the deadly Struggle for Heaven. He did not want to risk his life on this battle.

Thus, Luo Tian stayed in Lu Zhong's courtyard. Idle time allowed him to observe Lu Zhong's artificery, particularly his hammer technique.

While teaching Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue, Luo Tian learned alongside them. Initially, Lu Zhong gave the three a hammer and ordered them to strike an iron block until it became a plate—marking the first stage.

At first, they thought it simple. But upon attempting, they realized its difficulty. The hammer seemed small but was hard for their flesh to lift. The iron block, though solid, only sparked when struck.

"Disciple, Senior Sister, this iron is a Thousand-Year Xuanyun Iron. My brother Luxinshui and I spent ten years to turn it into a plate. Your talent is better than ours, so your speed should be much faster!" Lujiushan addressed Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue. Luxinshui nodded, recalling those painful memories.

"Thousand-Year Xuanyun Iron..." Luo Tian marveled at Lu Zhong's extravagance. This rare material was valuable, yet he used it to teach disciples.

"Ten years..." The mention of ten years made Luo Tian's heart tighten. He had intended to learn Lu Zhong's hammer technique but now realized its difficulty.

"Disciple, Senior Sister, a tip: Master's hammer technique is called Frenzied Wind Hammer. Don't rush to strike. Reflect on Master's previous technique and insights!" Luxinshui advised Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue.

"To demonstrate," Luxinshui took a hammer and iron block. As he gripped the hammer, Luo Tian noticed his demeanor changed—calm and mature, devoid of youthful impatience.

"Buzz..." A hammer wind rose. Next moment, a thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian's ears. The iron block bore a deep pit.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian furrowed his brow, staring at the iron block's dent. His eyes widened in awe.

"Using the hammer technique, it surpassed our flesh strength!" Meng Xue's face changed. He gazed at Luxinshui.

"He hasn't reached Master's level yet. It's still far off. Master has mastered the technique to perfection—each strike seems ordinary, yet this iron block becomes a plate!" Luxinshui's eyes glowed with admiration.

"Must learn. Other matters don't matter. This hammer technique will elevate my combat power, even surpassing the Zhenxian Eight Styles!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with determination.

"Train, endure!" For the following period, Luo Tian and his companions immersed themselves in training. Each day repeated the same action until exhaustion.

Time passed slowly. Three months later, while their initial struggle had eased and progress was evident, the Thousand-Year Xuanyun Iron had only slightly diminished. Only they could sense this change.

"Exceptional arm strength!" After three months of training, their arms had reached a terrifying level. This was not flesh strengthening but genuine power growth—like if they returned to humanity, their strength would be double that of ordinary people.

"Why?" For three months, Luo Tian pondered. What was the difference between himself and Lujiushan?

"Kid, you can leave. Your three items are done!" Just as Luo Tian mused, Lu Zhong's voice echoed in his mind. Luo Tian's eyes lit up with joy.

Chapter 1979: Giant God Array

In the Lower Three Realms, all sects were discussing one matter. The time for the Struggle for Heaven, as declared by the three elders of Shenglong Sect, was approaching—less than two months remained. During this period, the Shenglong Sect had unified its efforts.

To ensure success, they had spent heavily. Many sect secret realms were opened. The Shenglong Sect's overall strength had surged, elevating its status.

At this moment, the Shenglong Sect's hall hosted its high-ranking officials: Zang Yunfei, Sima Xiu, and Peng Tiande. Their faces bore worry.

"Lu Tian hasn't returned yet. Did he encounter an accident?" Sima Xiu spoke softly. With the Struggle for Heaven approaching, if Lu Tian, the sect's young prodigy, met misfortune, it would severely impact the Shenglong Sect's morale.

"He's clever. His life hasn't been shattered. He should be fine!"

"If we can't wait, then don't. Let Zhao Tiejing and Zhao Tiancheng replace him. That's acceptable!"

"Yes, wait three more days. This Giant God Array is our key to entering the Central Three Realms. We must perfect it. The five hall masters are almost there. If he doesn't return, we'll have to replace him!" Peng Tiande sighed.

The three elders had not been idle. They had ventured into the Lower Three Realms' dangerous places, seeking items to enhance their sect's strength. They had indeed found a heritage in an ancient site.

Not only did they elevate their strength, nearing True Immortal Peak, but they also obtained a grand array. The more participants, the stronger the power. They decided to use the five hall masters as the array's core—its eye.

First, this would elevate the hall masters' prestige. Second, they were suitable for controlling the array, as their highest cultivation was Celestial Peak.
