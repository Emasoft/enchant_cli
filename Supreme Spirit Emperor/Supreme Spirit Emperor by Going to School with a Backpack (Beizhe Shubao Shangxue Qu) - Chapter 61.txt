“First question—do you know where there’s a teleportation array in the Eastern Domain?” Luo Tian asked his first question, which concerned his future direction and whether he could quickly return to the Northern Domain.

“Teleportation array?” The shop assistant’s face showed a hint of confusion, muttering the three words repeatedly as if recalling where one might exist.

“I’ve heard that the Eastern Domain does indeed have teleportation arrays. I overheard customers discussing it at the shop. These arrays are controlled by major sects; ordinary people aren’t allowed to leave the Eastern Domain, and entering it requires thorough checks. Since then, no one has ever left the Eastern Domain. To escape, one must cross the Northern Sea, but I’ve never heard of anyone successfully crossing it. The sea holds endless dangers and fierce beasts; it’s impossible to pass through!” The shop assistant explained what he knew.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows upon hearing the assistant’s words. Teleportation arrays were monopolized by great sects, but he knew that the sects of the Eastern Domain were mysterious and few knew their exact locations.

“Can you tell me where the major sects in the Eastern Domain are?” Luo Tian asked again, clinging to a sliver of hope.

“Sir, you’re joking. Not even the second-rate sects do I know about. These major sects rarely emerge from seclusion; their disciples don’t wander outside, and they remain indifferent to worldly affairs. That’s why the Eastern Domain is so chaotic. Other cities are stronger than Beiming City, but competition remains fierce, and only second-rate sects bother to manage it—just barely,” the shop assistant replied with a foolish expression, scrutinizing Luo Tian.

“Then tell me about the Qi family. The more details, the better!” Luo Tian knew the assistant didn’t know anything else and decided to leave Beiming City to inquire in other cities or second-rate sects. He asked about the Qi family.

Upon hearing the name “Qi,” Wu Di’s face lit up with emotion. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to genuinely help him.

The shop assistant’s face shifted slightly when he heard the name “Qi,” scrutinizing Luo Tian before lowering his voice: “Sir, are you asking about the Qi family’s auction or…?”

“Everything I want to know,” Luo Tian replied, placing another twenty pieces of vital energy stones into the assistant’s pocket. Twenty pieces of vital energy stones were nothing to Luo Tian, who had mountains of them in his storage ring.

Yet the twenty pieces thrilled the assistant; combined with the ten he’d received earlier, that was thirty stones—equivalent to two days’ wages.

“I’ll start by telling you who the Qi family has. Their patriarch is Qi De Rong, ranked seventh in Beiming City with a Bone-Devouring Intermediate cultivation. Qi De Rong has three sons, each quite remarkable—more than one might expect.”

Luo Tian showed no expression. He naturally knew Qi De Rong was renowned in Beiming City; otherwise, he wouldn’t dare host an auction. He must have had his own backing, or else in this land of the strong devouring the weak, he would’ve been wiped out long ago.

The shop assistant ignored Luo Tian and Wu Di’s thoughts, his face showing a hint of envy as he continued: “Qi Daolin’s eldest son reached Bone-Devouring Initial Stage two years ago. The second son entered the same stage over a year ago, and the third son was even more astonishing—he reached Bone-Devouring Initial Stage at twenty-five, just two months ago.”

Upon hearing the assistant’s words, Wu Di felt a bitter ache. He knew revenge would take ages. Luo Tian was only at Body-Refining Ninth Stage, and though he felt no one could defeat Luo Tian at this level, he knew the gap between Body-Refining and Bone-Devouring was immense.

Luo Tian silently mused, sighing at how much higher the quality of cultivators in the Eastern Domain was compared to the Northern. Even this small Beichang Domain had someone as young as twenty-five at Bone-Devouring Initial Stage—rare in the Northern Domain. Yet Luo Tian wasn’t overly concerned; as long as he was cautious, opening the Nourishing Dragon Seal would make them no problem. Plus, there was a dragon baby even more terrifying than himself.

This place wasn’t like the Northern Domain; no one knew him, and there were no challenges from prodigies. Here, it was either you or me; in critical moments, Luo Tian wouldn’t be foolish enough to fight fairly. He’d rely on the dragon baby.

The shop assistant glanced around, lowering his head and voice: “Rumors say the Qi family still has a patriarch alive—his cultivation is Bone-Devouring Apex, just one step away from entering the Soul Formation realm. With his time running out, it’s said this auction aims to gather vital energy stones to buy longevity pills and breakthrough aids for their old patriarch from outside cities.”

Upon hearing this, Luo Tian’s face slightly changed. A Bone-Devouring Apex cultivator was someone he couldn’t ignore.

Chapter 299: Recognized!

“Bone-Devouring Apex?” Luo Tian sighed softly, his gaze carrying a hint of regret as he looked at Wu Di’s bitter face.

Wu Di stood before Luo Tian, his face etched with bitterness. Seeing Luo Tian’s regretful gaze, he knew it was truly impossible for Luo Tian to avenge him. A Bone-Devouring Apex cultivator in Beiming City was like a god; even if Luo Tian defied fate, he couldn’t beat him.

Luo Tian was also郁闷, feeling as if wherever he went, he was suppressed. A Body-Refining Tianshi Sect cultivator at Bone-Devouring had chased him nearly to death. A Bone-Devouring cultivator had crushed Ying Hongtu and Bai Zhan Tian, then another变态 Yang Huanyu emerged.

Though Luo Tian was confident he wouldn’t lose to Yang Huanyu in a one-on-one fight, that变态 array had left him powerless. And the hand sign that pulled the Book of Epochs from his mind had terrified him.

Upon entering the Eastern Domain, he’d barely stepped into Beiming City—a secular city—when it turned out that every family’s patriarch was Bone-Devouring Apex.

Luo Tian couldn’t help but want to boost his strength again. Yet the Nourishing Seal in his hand prevented any progress; he could only rely on unlocking it at the moment of breakthrough. Fortunately, vital energy could still be cultivated within him. He knew that if he unlocked the Nourishing Dragon Seal at the moment of breakthrough, he’d enter the next stage.

But being constantly suppressed, and only able to unlock the Nourishing Dragon Seal three times a month, made him feel constrained.

“This Eastern Domain is much stronger than the Northern. Let’s see if I can find a way this time; being constantly suppressed isn’t good!” Luo Tian muttered internally.

Seeing Luo Tian seemingly deep in thought, the shop assistant waited a moment before continuing to pull him back: “Sir, let’s talk about this auction. It’s said the Qi family is selling many valuable items to raise funds for their patriarch. There’s even a regional-level martial skill—regional-level, truly!”

“Regional-level martial skill?” Luo Tian was finally stunned. He hadn’t expected a secular city in Beichang Domain to have such an item. After all, regional-level martial skills were treasures even in major sects or first-rate sects in the Northern Domain.

“Indeed! There’s also an Xuan-grade high-level treasure. And….” The assistant recited item after item as if listing dishes.

Luo Tian listened, marveling at how rich the Qi family must be. Yet he soon realized this wasn’t just the Qi family’s alone; auctions would surely have others selling items. Eventually, he stopped listening—his main goal had already been achieved. He signaled the assistant to leave and quietly sipped tea.

“Hey… I just recognized you. Who else could it be but Wu Di from the Wu family?” A sharp voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

Hearing this, Wu Di trembled behind Luo Tian, his face filled with anger as he looked toward the young man walking towards them in a floral robe.

“Zhou Yuzhe? It’s you?” Wu Di recognized the voice and gazed at the young man in floral robe.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, drawn by the voice. He almost spat out his tea—this young man’s attire was too “flashy.”

A crimson long robe embroidered with various flowers, as if a gathering of rare blossoms. Even his shoes were covered in flowers, making Luo Tian feel the man was out of place.

“This is the one who accidentally killed my reckless brother. His name is Zhou Yuzhe! He loves all kinds of flowers. Don’t be fooled by his outlandish attire; his talent is far better than his deceased brother!” Wu Di explained低声 to Luo Tian, his face grim.

“Hm,” Luo Tian nodded slightly, secretly sensing Zhou Yuzhe’s cultivation—solid Body-Refining Ninth Stage. Though it wasn’t much here, the Zhou family must have some influence in Beiming City, given their accompanying guards were Body-Refining Ninth Stage.

“Wu Di, I didn’t expect you to survive outside Beiming City. Your luck is good; reaching Body-Refining Fifth Stage is already impressive. As a废物, you’ve achieved this much—good enough. Why not just live like a dog outside Beiming City and dare to return here for death?” Zhou Yuzhe lightly caressed a blood-red rose on his robe, gazing at Wu Di with indifference.

“你！”

Wu Di’s face turned crimson. He wanted to fight Zhou Yuzhe, but he was clearly no match. Plus, Luo Tian was beside him; he didn’t want to drag Luo Tian into this.

“Hmph, I thought you had some backbone. Turns out you’ve clung to a big leg. Body-Refining Ninth Stage? Let’s see if that leg is thick enough to block a stick!” Zhou Yuzhe smiled, approaching the two. His gaze was unfriendly toward Luo Tian. Recalling that he hadn’t met anyone in Beiming City who could be trouble, his mind was at ease. He had already condemned Wu Di and Luo Tian to death.

To Zhou Yuzhe, Luo Tian was merely a Body-Refining Ninth Stage cultivator. Though strong, in Beiming City where even the doormen were Body-Refining Ninth Stage, he wasn’t much. Though Beiming City banned street fights, it depended on who—Wu family had been wiped out overnight, leaving Wu Di to survive outside the city.

Wu Di looked at Luo Tian, his face showing frustration. He longed to fight Zhou Yuzhe immediately.

“Whether the leg is thick enough depends on what stick it is. A person like you is just a stick in the eyes of that leg. With a little effort, it can be easily broken!” Luo Tian’s gaze turned lethal toward Zhou Yuzhe.

“Arrogant! I’ll see if your leg is thick enough. You two, what are you waiting for? Break his legs!” Zhou Yuzhe’s face turned cold, ordering the two Body-Refining Ninth Stage guards behind him.

“Yes, Master!” The guards replied, their expressions unkind as they stared at Luo Tian.

“Kid, leave. In this teahouse, if you break things, you’ll have to pay—wasteful!” One of the guards smiled, addressing Luo Tian. Clearly, they were hesitant here, and they knew the teahouse’s owner wasn’t ordinary.

“Would this Zhou family boy’s death mean they’re extinct?” Luo Tian smiled playfully, turning to Wu Di.

“Uh…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Wu Di was stunned, his eyes filled with oddity.

Chapter 300: Qi Wenhao

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, not only Wu Di was stunned but also the onlookers around them showed strange expressions.

“Forgive me, elder. This Zhou Yuzhe has always been a cripple. His disability is there!” Wu Di said, his gaze shifting to Zhou Yuzhe’s crotch, implying it without saying.

“Uh…” Luo Tian clearly understood Wu Di’s meaning and his face showed a strange expression.

Zhou Yuzhe’s face turned狰狞, his illness was known throughout Beiming City. Yet no one dared to mention it; anyone who did would face his wrath. Now, hearing Wu Di’s words, his face was about to bleed: “Kill him! Right here. I’ll take the blame!”

Zhou Yuzhe’s words fell, and the teahouse seemed unchanged. It was commonplace here—disputes led to fights; if someone died, those with connections had no issues. Those without were beaten or killed and thrown out of the city.

“You dare?” Wu Di’s face was shocked. He hadn’t entered Beiming City for years, but he still knew its rules.

“Kill me? See if you have the ability!” Luo Tian was never afraid of anything. If he killed someone, he’d just leave. He was confident no one could stop him. If provoked, he’d slaughter the Zhou family and leave.

“Kid, you’re dead!” One guard’s words echoed. The two men were already before Luo Tian, ignoring Wu Di’s shocked expression and punching him.

Feeling the two Body-Refining Ninth Stage guards’ strength, Luo Tian smiled wickedly. He’d killed countless such cultivators—just the Northern Domain’s war alone had seen him kill over a thousand. Killing them was like killing chickens.

Luo Tian also knew that in Beiming City, being soft and patient was useless. The more he endured, the more they thought him weak, leading to endless trouble. Only by intimidating them constantly could he prevent further issues.

“嗡…”

The Cracking Heaven Spear emitted a piercing hum, landing in Luo Tian’s hands. Two spear shadows instantly transformed into two long snakes with exposed fangs, biting the guards’ throats.

A flash of cold light—before the two guards could react, their throats felt a chill and lost life.

“Pang… Pang…” The two bodies fell, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Hiss…” A gasp echoed from the crowd. People couldn’t believe this frail young man had dared to kill here, and his strength was so formidable.

“You?” Zhou Yuzhe’s face darkened, a hint of panic in his eyes. He knew the two guards’ strength well; yet they were instantly killed by Luo Tian without a chance to fight. So, what was this young man’s strength?

“Run…” Zhou Yuzhe had only one thought in that moment—without hesitation, he turned and fled toward the teahouse’s door.

“Come back!” Luo Tian’s body闪动, golden light radiating from his feet. Yet he didn’t use the Sealing Steps—firstly, it wasn’t necessary; secondly, Leng Qiuchan had instructed him to avoid using it if possible, especially in the Eastern Domain.

With just his physical strength, Zhou Yuzhe couldn’t escape. Luo Tian instantly appeared behind him and thrust the spear into his heart.

“Puo…” Zhou Yuzhe was no better than the two guards. The Cracking Heaven Spear, with its piercing intent, pierced Zhou Yuzhe’s body and hung him high on the spear.

“Who is this kid? He dares to kill Zhou Yuzhe! The Zhou family isn’t a major clan here, but they aren’t easily insulted. This kid doesn’t care about the Zhou family!” People were now greatly alarmed, not expecting Luo Tian to dare kill Zhou Yuzhe in front of everyone.

Wu Di rubbed his eyes, his face filled with intense disbelief. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so bold, but seeing Zhou Yuzhe’s body hanging on the spear, Wu Di’s face showed intense excitement.

“Pang…” Luo Tian tossed Zhou Yuzhe’s body beside the two guards, as if nothing had happened. He softly said: “Assistant, have someone take care of the bodies! Also, tell me how much money I need to compensate for the broken tables and chairs!”

Luo Tian turned, placing the Cracking Heaven Spear beside the table without retrieving it. He knew someone would come for it soon.

“Good!”

The assistant smiled, casually throwing the three bodies out of the teahouse. Clearly, this wasn’t his first time doing so. He knew someone would come to take the bodies soon. Water-element vital energy gathered on the ground, cleaning up the bloodstains. He turned and walked toward the back of the teahouse.

“Who’s this? Another person was killed in the city! I wonder which family’s son it is!” Zhou Yuzhe’s body had barely fallen outside when people gathered curiously.

“Hiss… Isn’t this Zhou family’s son? How did he die here!” People gathered around the body and quickly recognized it.

“Quick, leave. The Zhou family will surely come soon. Don’t get caught up in this!” People scattered, looking at it once and then returning to their tasks.

Some people saw Zhou Yuzhe’s body, their faces slightly changed and rushed toward the Zhou family to spread the news.

Yet Luo Tian acted as if nothing had happened, still sipping tea in the teahouse.

“Elder… sir, shouldn’t we find a place to hide?” Wu Di felt uneasy but also excited. Zhou Yuzhe was dead, and he had avenged some of his grudges. Luo Tian’s actions were all because of him.

“Indeed, young man, you should leave! You can’t stay in Beiming City!” A burly middle-aged man at the door spoke, urging Luo Tian to leave. He said it casually; whether he left was up to Luo Tian.

“Pang…” The burly man’s body instantly turned into a shower of blood, staining the door red.

“I think you can’t leave!” A fifty-year-old middle-aged man appeared at the door, his face dark with a sinister expression. He looked at Luo Tian and Wu Di as if they were already dead.

Chapter 301: Zhou Tianxiong

“Zhou Tianxiong! I didn’t expect him to come so fast!” People gasped upon seeing the middle-aged man’s figure at the door.

Luo Tian sipped his tea, the teacup shattering in his hand. He stared at the bloodstained ground, his anger reaching its peak. That man had merely warned him, and they weren’t acquainted. Yet because of that one sentence, he lost his life. Luo Tian hated it when others were caught up because of him.

“Is this the old man of the Zhou family?” Luo Tian’s face turned cold, turning to Wu Di.

“Yes! He is Zhou Yuzhe’s father, Zhou Tianxiong. He is also the patriarch of the Zhou family!” Wu Di’s face was grim, his heart already resigned. Since Zhou Yuzhe was dead, he wouldn’t feel it was a loss.

“Killing the son and then the father. I wonder who will come next!” Luo Tian mused, ignoring Zhou Tianxiong’s dark expression.

“Arrogant! Just a Body-Refining Ninth Stage, yet you speak so boldly!” Zhou Tianxiong spoke softly, his hand holding a long staff. It whistled through the air with brown earth-element vital energy, smashing toward Luo Tian.

“Bone-Devouring Initial Stage? Old dog, let’s fight outside. Are you sure to fight here in this teahouse?” Luo Tian smiled, having fought countless Bone-Devouring Initial Stages. The Cracking Heaven Spear radiated supreme power, meeting Zhou Tianxiong’s staff.

“Pang…” The thunderous sound echoed, shaking the ears of onlookers and leaving them in disbelief.

Both men stepped back. Zhou Tianxiong’s face showed a hint of surprise; he hadn’t expected his full-force staff to be blocked by Luo Tian.

“This youth, which sect did he come from? He’s too reckless!” People watched Luo Tian stepping back two steps, even less than Zhou Tianxiong, and trembled in awe.

Zhou Tianxiong收回 his staff, his face slightly changed. He thought of the teahouse and glanced cautiously at its back before speaking lowly: “Kid, leave!”

Luo Tian smiled slightly and strode toward the door without fear. The Cracking Heaven Spear stood firmly on the ground, his face showing a hint of battle intent.

“Who are you? I haven’t heard of you in Beiming City. Where did you come from?” Zhou Tianxiong’s face showed concern as he stepped out of the teahouse.

Some people who loved to watch热闹 also exited the teahouse, their faces curious as they looked at Luo Tian.

“Old dog, who I am isn’t your business!” Luo Tian’s mouth slightly curled. The Cracking Heaven Spear was raised again, and the Golden Snake Madness technique instantly unleashed. A golden snake with exposed fangs rushed toward Zhou Tianxiong. This attack didn’t use the Five Elements’ Mutual Generation.

Since entering Beiming City, Luo Tian hadn’t used much vital energy. When he did, he only used the gold-element. Using five elements would easily expose his identity. Luo Tian didn’t know if there were any members of the Tianshi Sect in the Eastern Domain. If so, he’d be in trouble without support here.

“This technique is indeed mysterious. However, to defeat me, it’s a foolish hope. Wolf Fang Staff!” Zhou Tianxiong sneered, his staff swirling and forming a brown wolf-shaped illusion to bite the golden snake.

The thunderous sound echoed again, neutralizing Luo Tian’s technique. Zhou Tianxiong stepped back but grabbed his gray staff and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He smiled: “Indeed, he has some skills. The cultivators in Beiming City are stronger than the average Bone-Devouring Stage in the Northern Domain.”

The Cracking Heaven Spear remained firmly in his hand, no fear on his face. The spear danced, attacking Zhou Tianxiong.

The piercing sound of weapons clashing continuously formed around the two. The crowd watching grew larger.

“Isn’t this Zhou Tianxiong? Who is this youth?” A man with a grotesque scar on his face asked softly.

“You don’t know? This Zhou Tianxiong’s son was killed by this youth. Naturally, he won’t let it go! There’ll be a good show now. Remember, the Zhou family’s backer is the Qi family!” A middle-aged man explained to those around him with suspicion.

“This spear technique, it’s so familiar!” A young man watching Luo Tian use Golden Snake Madness looked more puzzled.

“Pang…” Luo Tian withdrew, not wanting to waste time with Zhou Tianxiong. He decided to end it once and for all.

“Golden Snake Madness!”

“Human King Seal!” At this moment, Luo Tian’s vital energy strength had reached变态 levels. The technique’s power was incomparably different. Two techniques were unleashed the moment he finished speaking.

“Trivial tricks!” Zhou Tianxiong sneered, but his heart was secretly shocked by Luo Tian’s变态. A Body-Refining Ninth Stage cultivator could fight him evenly—just the physical strength alone was already stronger than himself, a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage.

His wolffang staff swung, accompanied by heavy earth-element vital energy on his back. His entire back turned brown—this was the characteristic of Bone-Devouring Stage, the bone.

“Pang…” The Human King Seal radiated golden light, smashing onto Zhou Tianxiong’s back with a闷 sound.

“This technique is no ordinary one!”

Zhou Tianxiong silently felt the Human King Seal’s power, his heart shocked.

Yet Luo Tian didn’t give Zhou Tianxiong a moment to breathe. His hands formed countless残影 in the air, his mouth slightly curled: “Soul-Stealing Seal!”

An invisible mental seal, accompanied by an invisible wind, smashed toward Zhou Tianxiong’s head.

Zhou Tianxiong, a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage cultivator, had his mental strength at the Mental Formation Initial Stage. He felt a terrifying fluctuation and his face changed.

“Too late! When you fight me, you still think of other things!” Luo Tian’s mouth curled into a sinister arc. With one thought, the mental seal smashed onto Zhou Tianxiong’s head.

Under people’s astonished gazes, Zhou Tianxiong was as if hit by something and flew backward.

“Ah…” Zhou Tianxiong felt his mind ringing, his head feeling like it would explode. His hands uncontrollably clutched his head and rolled on the ground.

A flash of cold light—The Cracking Heaven Spear, like a venomous snake lurking in the dark, found its prey and rushed toward Zhou Tianxiong, who was crying out on the ground.

This spear was at its peak speed, like a lightning bolt in the night. The cold tip, with destructive power, pierced Zhou Tianxiong’s chest.

Blood splattered. Under people’s shocked gazes, the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage cultivator Zhou Tianxiong died in Beiming City.

“Hiss… Who is this youth! How strong he is! A Body-Refining Ninth Stage cultivator killing a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage one. I believe even the young geniuses of several families couldn’t do it!” People exclaimed loudly.

Chapter 302: Sticking a Stick into a Beehive

Wu Di’s eyes nearly popped out, his face filled with intense shock. He had prepared to die alongside Luo Tian but hadn’t expected him to be so fierce, killing Zhou Tianxiong.

The people around also looked at Luo Tian. At this moment, he was no different from a demon in their eyes. They had never seen a Body-Refining Ninth Stage cultivator kill a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage one.

Luo Tian casually tossed Zhou Tianxiong’s body onto the ground. Blood dripped from the tip of the Cracking Heaven Spear.

“Why are you all just standing there! Move aside!” A series of shouts echoed as several Body-Refining Ninth Stage patrolmen entered the crowd.

“Patrol team?” People saw the several Body-Refining Ninth Stage men approaching, their faces shocked. They looked at Luo Tian who had just pulled the spear from Zhou Tianxiong’s chest.

“Hiss…” The leader of the group showed a hint of alarm upon seeing Zhou Tianxiong’s body.

“Did you kill him?” The leader looked at Luo Tian, still holding the bloodied spear, his face dark.

Seeing the leader’s serious expression, Luo Tian smiled inwardly. He naturally understood what was happening. He had fought with Zhou Tianxiong for a while, and these people hadn’t appeared until the fight ended. Clearly, someone had ordered them.

“Yes, what of it? No, what of it?” Luo Tian’s mouth curved slightly, speaking softly.

The people who had been sipping tea in the teahouse heard Luo Tian’s words, their mouths twitching. He had used the same tone to kill Zhou Yuzhe earlier. Clearly, if these patrolmen acted rashly, this youth would definitely kill them too.

Although they were Body-Refining Ninth Stage, they surely knew this youth could easily kill them. Zhou Tianxiong, a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage, wasn’t even a match for this youth.

“Who is he? These are patrolmen! Selected from various families, he won’t even respect them!” People sighed.

“Elder…” Wu Di now felt only admiration and gratitude. Zhou family’s father and son were dead, which had avenged a significant part of his grudge. As for the Qi family, he didn’t dare to think much now; after all, the Qi family was a giant in Beiming City, far beyond what a small Zhou Tianxiong could compare to.

“Yes, we must take you away. If not, break your legs and throw you out of Beiming City!” A young man in a white robe stepped forward.

Luo Tian sighed, patting his forehead. He inwardly cursed himself for having stuck a stick into a bee hive; killing one had brought out another.

“Who is this!” Luo Tian turned to Wu Di, his face already fed up with these bee hive-like people.

“This…” Wu Di’s face showed a hint of fear, his words stammering.

“My name is Qi Tianchu! I suppose you’ve never heard of me. But it’s unnecessary to know, since you’ll be dead soon!” The young man’s face showed arrogance. His body radiated a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage aura.

“Qi Tianchu, I didn’t expect him to come. He should be the second son of the Qi family!” People’s faces showed surprise.

“You’re Wu Di, right? I didn’t expect you to survive after leaving me a chance. It’s truly hard for you. But soon, you won’t feel the difficulty anymore because you’ll die with your new found support!” Qi Tianchu’s face showed amusement, looking at Wu Di.

Wu Di trembled under Qi Tianchu’s gaze. Though he was older, his heart still shook.

“Are you all coming out? Let’s get this over with. I’m tired of one after another!” Luo Tian waved his hand, his face showing impatience.

“Originally, I wanted you to live a little longer. Since you’re eager to die, I’ll have to grant your wish! Do you think killing Zhou Tianxiong makes you bold in Beiming City?” His blue vital energy filled his body, radiating a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage aura with a hint of contempt. He punched toward Luo Tian.

“Bone-Devouring Initial Stage? What’s that? I’ve killed Bone-Devouring Midst!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He still used gold-element vital energy, not retreating at all, and punched back.

Qi Tianchu stepped back, his face showing seriousness. He looked at Luo Tian standing still and felt he was stronger—much stronger.

“Regret? Too late! Today, I’ll see who kills whom!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. Though he had fought many battles, his vital energy was still abundant. The Cracking Heaven Spear rushed toward Qi Tianchu.

Qi Tianchu didn’t dare to be careless. His face showed seriousness, a green long sword appearing in his hand—like a wooden sword but radiating an aura no less than the Cracking Heaven Spear.

“This youth is who? He dares to kill even the Qi family! If this Qi Tianchu is also killed, it’ll be a big show!” People’s faces showed excitement. They didn’t care who lived or died; long years in Beiming City had made them eager to see someone challenge the major families.

“Stop…” Just as the spear and sword were about to collide, a figure with terrifying power appeared between them. One hand blocked the sword, and one hand grabbed Luo Tian’s spear, neutralizing both attacks.

“Father?” Qi Tianchu sighed in relief, his face showing confusion.

“Who are you? Why are you opposing my Qi family!” Ignoring Qi Tianchu’s voice, the middle-aged man’s face showed seriousness. He couldn’t discern this youth’s cultivation—though he seemed Body-Refining Ninth Stage, he could fight and even kill a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage.

“I also want to ask, I have no grudge with your Qi family. Why are you provoking me repeatedly and threatening to kill me?” Luo Tian spoke calmly. He knew this middle-aged man was Qi Tianchu’s father, Qi De Rong.

“Because you know well. Although the Zhou family is just a dog of ours, it’s said that beating a dog requires looking at its master. You’re beating our Qi family’s face!” Qi De Rong also remained calm.

“Then what do you want? To avenge your dog?” Luo Tian shouldered the Cracking Heaven Spear, his face showing amusement. His hand held a golden scale—Dragon Emperor’s reverse scale.

“Of course, we must avenge. But in another way. We can compromise. Just hand him over to us, and he won’t be our enemy but a friend of ours. This deal should be quite profitable, right?” Qi De Rong’s face showed a hint of cruelty, pointing at Wu Di.

Upon hearing Qi De Rong’s words, Wu Di felt a shock. Though he had prepared for death, his heart didn’t want Luo Tian to betray him.

Chapter 303: Retreat

Upon hearing Qi De Rong’s words, Luo Tian showed a hint of amusement. He looked at Wu Di, who was nearly thirty years old and stood behind him. His mouth slightly curved: “Sorry, not interested!”

“This kid is really bold! That’s Qi De Rong. I’ve never seen anyone directly refuse his conditions!” People sighed, this situation would have made them hesitate to accept.

“Elder!” Wu Di’s face was shocked. At this moment, he even felt like dying for Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected that their relationship was just ordinary, yet Luo Tian helped him so much. If he were in his place, he wouldn’t have done it. In Beiming City, anyone would hand over Wu Di to gain the Qi family’s friendship.

“Are you sure you don’t want to reconsider?” Qi De Rong’s face changed, he hadn’t expected himself to retreat so far, yet Luo Tian still refused.

Luo Tian’s gaze was indifferent. He knew this condition was tempting, but he understood the rules of Beichang Domain: the more powerful you are, the less people dare to bother you. Qi De Rong was clearly using a soft knife against him. If he agreed, it would mean he feared the Qi family and Qi De Rong, who would surely find a way to eliminate him.

Not to mention, using others’ lives for his own temporary safety was something Luo Tian couldn’t do.

“Fight if you want, stop talking and don’t waste my tea!” Luo Tian showed impatience, waving his hand as if swatting a fly at Qi De Rong.

The crowd’s faces twitched. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to treat Qi De Rong this way. After all, he was only Body-Refining Ninth Stage. To treat a Bone-Devouring Midst like this in Beiming City was almost suicide.

Qi De Rong’s face alternated between dark and light, thinking for a while before squeezing out a sentence through his teeth: “You’ll regret this. We’re leaving. Until we meet again!”
