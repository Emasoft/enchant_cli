Seeing that everyone was gazing in the direction Luo Tian pointed, Wang Tianxiang couldn’t help but glance at Luo Tian and murmured, “It seems people are about to part ways. These people truly are... as soon as they discovered something valuable, they all acted like cats that smelled blood, forgetting they were saved by us!”

Luo Tian shrugged indifferently and smiled. These people weren’t truly friends; they were merely acquaintances. Previously, they had already coveted the medicinal herbs he provided, but they had been restrained by his strength. However, Luo Tian knew that if they encountered something truly eye-catching, these people would definitely attack him first before vying for the treasure.

Luo Tian and his companions advanced toward the crowd, but the previous group had already dispersed again. Some people, upon seeing Luo Tian approach, flashed a brief look of guilt on their faces, while most displayed wary expressions.

Luo Tian observed the array before him. Though he wasn’t particularly skilled in arrays, he knew that breaking one required either a brute-force assault—like how he had shattered the Jiali clan’s Golden Dragon Array with the Emperor Seal—or understanding its principles.

This array, however, was vastly superior to the Jiali clan’s Golden Dragon Array. Luo Tian found himself at a loss, even though his strength had grown immeasurably since before.

Yet he knew that alone, he couldn’t break this array.

At that moment, several disciples from other sects who understood arrays stood before the array, their eyes filled with awe.

“Hey, can you figure out anything about this?” Wang Tianxiang called out to a disciple from the Kuang Dao Sect, his voice low.

“This array must have been set by a great sage. I can’t even determine its level with my current expertise!” the disciple replied, his face etched with bitterness as he glanced at Wang Tianxiang and Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s gaze swept over the other sect disciples who understood arrays, all of whom wore furrowed brows. He felt a pang of helplessness.

He extended his spiritual sense, though he knew it was futile. Still, he habitually spread it across the array’s boundary.

“This! It seems to be the Hun Tian Bu Yuan Array!” a disciple from an unknown sect exclaimed, his voice trembling as he stared at the massive array boundary.

All around turned their gazes toward the young man, faces alight with joy.

Seemingly flustered by so many eyes upon him, the youth’s face flushed slightly but he quickly explained.

The Hun Tian Bu Yuan Array! Ranked as a fourth-tier array, though it was only fourth-tier, its complexity rivaled that of sixth-tier arrays. Even master array-artisans would need to devote their full focus to construct it, and the array banners required special materials. The Hun Tian Bu Yuan Array’s hallmark was its resilience, continuously absorbing the world’s primordial energy over time, becoming stronger with each passing year. If it endured for an unimaginable duration, this array could even trap the soul of a Yuanling-level cultivator or higher.

As people marveled, the disciple recounted what he remembered of the Hun Tian Bu Yuan Array’s records. The listeners were awestruck.

“Gou Xueming, how long has this array been in place?” a disciple recognized the youth and called out低声.

“From my guess, it’s been at least a century! That means it could trap even a bone-fragmenting-level powerhouse!” Gou Xueming’s face fell, his voice low.

Hearing Gou Xueming’s words, the crowd’s faces also bore disappointment. If even bone-fragmenting-level cultivators were trapped, what chance did they, mere body-refining-level disciples, have?

“Let’s all attack the array! Perhaps we can break it!” a white-cloaked youth behind Gou Xueming shouted.

“Good! Let’s give it our all! It’s better than not trying at all!” others echoed.

Soon, they reached a consensus. Luo Tian remained silent, his gaze sweeping over Gou Xueming before saying nothing more.

Soon, someone organized the group. Luo Tian and his companions joined in, nearly a hundred people standing before the vast array, their energy fluctuations constantly emanating from their hands.

Luo Tian slowly activated the Emperor Seal’s hand signs, gently pushing forward.

Though they were all body-refining-level disciples, they were each the best of their sects. The weakest of their martial arts was a middle-tier Yellow-grade technique.

Colorful martial arts converged in the sky, forming long dragons of energy, their terrifying power smashing into the Hun Tian Bu Yuan Array.

Luo Tian observed this overwhelming fluctuation. With so many attacks, it could definitely harm a bone-fragmenting-level powerhouse!

The explosion roared, shaking people’s eardrums. The collision force spread outward, causing some with low cultivation to lose their balance. Even Luo Tian swayed slightly.

People watched expectantly as the array was struck by their martial arts, but they soon felt disappointment. Though their techniques were powerful, they only created a slight crack in the array’s boundary. Within an instant, the array restored itself to its original state.

“Alas… it seems the treasure is truly inaccessible! Even with so many people, we couldn’t break through!” the crowd sighed.

“Let’s go! Hurry and find where the light screen is, since that’s where the good things are!” people grumbled as they left this place to search for the light screen.

Of course, some remained stubbornly, continuing to try breaking the array, but after finding no progress, they eventually left.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly as he gazed at the array, then said to Dong Sansi and Wang Tianxiang behind him: “Let’s go.”

At this point, his group had dwindled to just a few people. After all, bone-fragmenting-level powerhouses were blocked outside by that terrifying voice. In the forest, people were all body-refining-level cultivators, and they still had confidence in their strength.

Luo Tian and his companions wandered through the Dahan Forest. After about a few moments, Luo Tian and his group didn’t know how far they had walked. However, when they were halfway through their journey, Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly.

“Let’s go back!” Luo Tian’s light laugh echoed, leaving the others astonished.

Though they didn’t understand what Luo Tian meant, out of trust in him, they followed behind.

When they reached halfway, they realized Luo Tian was heading back to the original array location. However, when they were still a hundred paces away, Luo Tian stopped and had everyone conceal themselves.

Chapter 137: Array Unfolds

As Luo Tian and his group concealed themselves, a wind sound entered their ears.

Figures emerged, and Wang Tianxiang and others were surprised to see them—Gou Xueming and the youth who had previously urged everyone to attack the array together.

“Gouzi! Do you really have a way to break this array?” the youth asked, his face filled with doubt as he whispered to Gou Xueming.

“Haha! A bunch of fools. I truly couldn’t open it before, but after this group attacked it together, I have an 80% chance of breaking the array!” Gou Xueming’s face bore a sneer, no longer resembling the timid youth people had seen before.

Though their words were low, there was no one else around; the area was desolate. Naturally, their voices reached Luo Tian and his group’s ears.

“Damn it!” the others mentally cursed, but they dared not make a sound for fear of being heard.

At that moment, Gou Xueming waved his hands continuously, and golden array banners with faint energy fluctuations rose around him.

The youth beside him was tense, watching Gou Xueming closely.

Time passed quickly. When Gou Xueming’s front was filled with a hundred and eight array banners, his face turned pale, and he panted heavily.

“Buzz…” A white light flared up, shooting toward the crack created by their previous attack.

“Quick! Spit your blood onto it!” Gou Xueming panted, instructing his companion.

“Okay!” The youth leaped high, slicing his fingertip and letting a drop of blood fall onto the junction between the light column and the array.

After absorbing the youth’s blood, the light column instantly turned crimson, as if it had changed identity. A hostile aura radiated from the column.

But before the youth could react, the light column seemed to have a will of its own, generating a tearing force that yanked the youth back mid-fall.

“Roar… Gou Xueming! You tricked me!” the youth howled, his body shattering apart. A mist of blood was absorbed by the light column, making its redness even more sinister.

“Hmph! Fool! If it weren’t for the array needing a sacrifice, I wouldn’t have brought you here!” Gou Xueming’s lips curled into a sneer, his face devoid of remorse, flashing a cold glint.

Luo Tian watched Gou Xueming and inwardly sighed at how deeply he had hidden his true nature. If it weren’t for Luo Tian sensing Gou Xueming secretly marking the crack during their attack, he would have been deceived.

As Luo Tian marveled, Gou Xueming gazed hungrily at the red light that had absorbed his companion’s blood. He forcefully plunged it into the array, and immediately after, a cracking sound was heard.

“Hun Tian Bu Yuan Array! Open!” Gou Xueming roared, his hands moving swiftly. The array banners around him rustled violently, and the red light intensified.

“Crack… crack…” The sound of cracking echoed repeatedly. Under Gou Xueming’s expectant gaze, the array finally broke open.

A towering tree appeared before Gou Xueming, its trunk massive enough to be surrounded by nearly a hundred people. A dark hole at the base of the tree radiated intense wood-element energy.

Luo Tian and his companions stared at the giant tree, their faces filled with intense shock. The Dahan Forest was no stranger to towering ancient trees, but compared to this one, they were like weeds.

“Do you think we’ve arrived at a bad time for this kid?” Wang Tianxiang murmured.

Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly: “He already has someone to surprise him!”

Before Luo Tian’s words had finished, several wind sounds echoed. Then, several figures with body-refining ninth-tier energy fluctuations appeared in Luo Tian’s group’s vision.

“Haha… Gou, you truly hid your talents well! I never expected this array to be broken by you. Fortunately, I had my suspicions; otherwise, this treasure would’ve been yours alone!”

“Indeed! Lan Xiu Chen spoke well!”

As the voices faded, figures gathered. Several youths stood before Gou Xueming, their faces carrying a faint mocking expression.

“You!” Gou Xueming’s face flashed with shock before darkening.

Gou Xueming knew that in his current state of having just broken the array, he was no match for these people. He immediately dove into the dark hole without hesitation.

“Fast runner!” The first youth to speak sneered, watching Gou Xueming vanish into the dark entrance.

“Indeed! Fast runner!” A bold voice echoed, another youth looking at the blue-cloaked figure with a fierce battle intent.

“Good thing Luo Tian didn’t notice Gou Xueming’s oddity; otherwise, this treasure would’ve been out of our reach!” The blue-cloaked figure muttered, his eyes flashing a strong sense of fear at the mention of Luo Tian.

Hearing Luo Tian’s name, others also bore a solemn expression, clearly fearing Luo Tian to the core.

“Cold Jade Dragon, do you intend to fight me now?” The blue-cloaked youth saw the battle intent in Cold Jade Dragon’s eyes and asked lowly.

“Lan Yichen, we will have our fight!” Cold Jade Dragon knew it wasn’t the time to battle Lan Yichen. If he fought now, others would take advantage. He suppressed his battle intent and sneered.

“Everyone, the treasure belongs to those with virtue. Let’s go in first; don’t forget that this Gou kid got there first!” Lan Yichen saw the crowd’s interest in him and Cold Jade Dragon, naturally understanding their thoughts. He let out a sneer.

Hearing Lan Yichen’s words, the crowd regained their composure and stepped into the hole. The entrance fell briefly silent.

Not long after, Luo Tian’s group appeared before the hole. Luo Tian’s face was expressionless, but Wang Tianxiang and Dong Sansi bore angry expressions.

“Diyun Sect, Lan Yichen; Liehu Sect, Cold Jade Dragon…” Wang Tianxiang recited a string of names.

“These people truly don’t know how to be grateful! They even guard against you!”

Wang Tianxiang clearly remembered that several of them had been saved by Luo Tian from the medicinal herb garden’s illusion. He was furious at their current guardedness toward Luo Tian.

“Indeed!” Dong Sansi and others echoed, clearly angry at these people’s ungratefulness.

Luo Tian smiled faintly: “Alright, it doesn’t matter. Let’s go in; otherwise, we’ll miss even the soup.”

Though his tone was calm, Dong Sansi knew Luo Tian had some anger in him.

Chapter 138: First-Tier Sects

The Dahan Forest, a notorious place on the Tianyuan Continent where most of its fierce beasts gathered. Due to the abundance of fierce beasts, it had become a famous dangerous place on the Tianyuan Continent.

The forest rarely saw people enter, making it tranquil. But this tranquility was shattered by the radiant light screen a few days ago. Northern domain sects flocked here in droves.

“Roar…” A loud dragon roar echoed across the Dahan Forest’s outskirts, followed by several massive figures that obscured the sun.

What stunned people was that flying dragons stood atop these creatures, their faces filled with boundless arrogance. Though the flying dragons weren’t true dragon kin and could only grow to earth-level, they still possessed the arrogance of dragon kin. To have a flying dragon as a steed clearly indicated these people’s status was no ordinary one.

The second-tier sects’ bone-fragmenting-level elders, who had been driven out by that cold voice before, looked up at the sky upon seeing people arrive.

“Flying dragons!” A senior from Feiyun Sect gasped, staring at the massive figures that obscured the sun.

The flying dragons were clearly earth-level fierce beasts, but they still caused these bone-fragmenting-level elders to feel pressure.

“Boom!” A heavy sound echoed, and the flying dragons’ massive bodies crashed down, creating gusts of wind.

The figures atop the flying dragons became visible to everyone’s eyes.

“Xuanyin Sect, it was rumored this sect had connections with the幽冥宗 (Yao Ming Sect) in the southern domain. I never expected they would also arrive!” Feiyun Sect’s enforcement senior Yu Pengfei stared at the arrogant figure atop the flying dragon, his face filled with shock.

“Lian Shen Sect, Jing Lei Sect, Bai Lian Sect!” Other second-tier sects watched the figures atop the flying dragons, their faces also filled with shock as they named each sect.

“Unexpectedly, the treasures of Dahan Forest have caught the attention of these first-tier sects!” Yu Pengfei’s face bore a hint of confusion.

The people atop the flying dragons seemed to ignore the second-tier sects’ elders standing below, merely exchanging glances. Whether they were youths or senior leaders, a battle intent flowed between them.

These elders atop the flying dragons all possessed bone-fragmenting-level peak cultivation, while the youths were body-refining ninth-tier. However, their auras surpassed ordinary bone-fragmenting-level and body-refining-ninth-tier disciples by countless times.

“Unexpectedly, you people arrived quite fast!” A senior from the Lian Shen Sect glanced at the second-tier sects’ elders below, his face filled with disdain.

“Yes! Who gave you the courage to meddle in this matter!” Other senior leaders spoke one after another, their pressure radiating from them.

Though Yu Pengfei and others could resist, they dared not. They knew the terror of first-tier sects. Though Wuxing Sect was called the top sect on the Tianyuan Continent, it was only based on numbers.

Yu Pengfei and others knew that countless terrifying sects existed on the Tianyuan Continent, either hidden or ruling over regions. The current few sects were among the top-tier in the northern domain, and some even had the power to rival Wuxing Sect.

“Hmph… it’s just because you were closer and arrived first. Useless people have no achievements!” The leader of the Lian Shen Sect spoke coldly.

Though these second-tier sects’ elders were angry, they dared not speak out, merely lowering their heads to endure this humiliation.

“Did Wuxing Sect’s people come?” The senior of the Xuanyin Sect asked coldly, clearly only valuing Wuxing Sect.

“They did. A bone-fragmenting-level leader, but he didn’t enter; instead…” A senior from Kuang Dao Sect who had a good relationship with Luo Tian whispered the details.

“But what?” The Xuanyin Sect senior impatiently waved his hand.

The Kuang Dao Sect senior dared not delay, quickly recounting how Luo Tian had beaten Huang Tianxiao before.

Hearing of Luo Tian’s strength, the first-tier sects’ seniors atop the flying dragons showed rare expressions of shock.

The youths also furrowed their brows, adding Luo Tian’s name to their thoughts.

“Unexpectedly, Wuxing Sect has produced a commendable disciple!” The seniors atop the flying dragons all sighed, but their eyes held confidence.

“Alright, let’s go in; don’t let these useless people take the lead. That would be quite embarrassing!” Several seniors lightly patted their flying dragons.

“Roar…” The flying dragons let out a low roar and soared into the sky again.

Watching the few flying dragons soar away, the second-tier sects’ elders looked at them with mockery, their hearts filled with a sneer.

“Roar…” A mournful sound echoed as the flying dragons’ massive bodies crashed onto the ground with a thunderous roar.

“Bone-fragmenting-level, those who enter die! I’ll say it once more: don’t test my patience!” A cold, domineering voice echoed in people’s minds.

The flying dragons, like mice encountering a cat, cowered and dared not raise their heads. The bone-fragmenting-level elders’ faces bore intense shock, and they fled toward the Dahan Forest’s outskirts.

“Hmph! Even if you met that person, you still ran like a mouse!” The second-tier sects’ elders sneered in their hearts, feeling satisfaction.

The elders who had previously been arrogant now bore a lingering fear of the Dahan Forest, their bodies involuntarily trembling. They exchanged glances and fell silent, even daring not to care about the flying dragons within the forest.

Several body-refining-level disciples exchanged glances, having not heard that cold voice. However, the flying dragons’ massive bodies crashing down had also thrown them off balance.

“From now on, you must rely on yourselves; we can’t help!” The bone-fragmenting-level seniors outside the forest transmitted their thoughts to the disciples of their sects.

Hearing the seniors’ transmissions, the youths naturally understood what had happened and exchanged glances, their bodies vanishing from atop the cowering flying dragons.

Deep within the Dahan Forest, a middle-aged man wore a slight smile, his eyes filled with anticipation as he murmured: “Finally, they’ve all arrived!”

Luo Tian was unaware of what had just happened. He only heard several dragon roars and now stood within the dark tree hole, unaware that first-tier sects’ top disciples had already entered the Dahan Forest.

Chapter 139: Cave Palace

As Luo Tian and his group stepped into the dark tree hole, they were stunned by what they saw. This wasn’t just a cave—it was clearly a cultivated disciple’s palace, and an opulent one at that.

The entire tree hole was embedded with night pearls, their soft glow illuminating the cave. Only a few open rooms were visible, but Gou Xueming and those youths weren’t there.

Looking up at the high stairs leading to the second level, they realized this ancient tree had more than one level. How many levels it had remained unknown. They scanned the few rooms but found nothing remarkable.

In one room, Luo Tian saw several dark, unremarkable seeds in his hand. He assessed them and realized these seeds had been refined for a long time. Slight pressure made the seeds turn to ash.

Seeing others had no luck, they moved toward the second level. The stairs were nearly ten zhang high, leaving them in awe of the tree’s height.

Halfway up, they felt energy fluctuations from the second level and heard voices of scolding and fighting.

Luo Tian’s group hurried their steps. When they reached the second level, they witnessed a surprising sight.

The youths who had entered after Gou Xueming were now fighting fiercely, vying for a black curved sword.

Whoever obtained the sword would inevitably become the target of everyone’s attacks. Thus, no one dared to claim it; instead, they fought joyfully.

“This sword seems like the Wuhen Dao!” Wang Tianxiang observed the black curved sword, his face filled with contemplation.

Hearing the word “Wuhan Dao,” Dong Sansi behind Wang Tianxiang was shocked.

“Wuhu Dao, killing without traces! A Yellow-grade weapon. It was the famed weapon of Meng Wuhu, a bone-fragmenting-level powerhouse who once challenged an Yuanling-level opponent and escaped unscathed, establishing his fame. This Wuhen Dao became renowned in the northern domain!”

People recalled the introduction of the Wuhen Dao.

But what caught Luo Tian’s attention wasn’t the black long sword but the red metal that seemed ordinary yet radiated sharpness from a corner.

As he climbed the stairs, his storage ring’s Rupture Heaven Spear emitted an intense longing, as if a crying baby. The object causing this longing was the red metal in the corner.

Hearing Luo Tian’s group arrive at the stairs, the youths默契 (mutually) stopped their fight. Seeing it was Luo Tian, they all gasped in surprise.

“Luo… Luo Tian!” Lan Yichen stammered, his face filled with solemnity and fear.

Luo Tian was about to greet them but saw the youths exchange glances, as if reaching an unspoken agreement. Without a word, they unleashed their martial arts from their hands.

Luo Tian hadn’t intended to fight for anything, merely wanted to discuss the red metal’s ownership. But these youths hadn’t even considered it before attacking him.

Luo Tian had already been angry at them, and with Dong Sansi and Wang Tianxiang behind him—whose strength was only body-refining seventh-tier—they couldn’t withstand so many martial arts.

His eyes flashed with coldness, and he immediately unleashed the Emperor Seal to crush their martial arts.

Dong Sansi and Wang Tianxiang hadn’t understood what was happening but saw Luo Tian block their path. Then the Emperor Seal appeared, and a powerful sound followed immediately.

“This!” Lan Yichen’s group saw Luo Tian effortlessly block their combined attack and turned pale.

At that moment, Wang Tianxiang and Dong Sansi finally understood what had happened. They all cursed loudly, even Dong Sansi, who was usually quiet, began to curse: “You really are bastards! You didn’t even ask before attacking us. How dare you forget that Luo Tian saved you? Without Luo Tian, you’d still be entangled by this tree. Now it’s like this—ungrateful bastards!”

Luo Tian was surprised at Dong Sansi, never expecting the usually quiet man to erupt so fiercely.

Lan Yichen and Cold Jade Dragon looked at Dong Sansi’s group, their faces flashing a brief sense of guilt. But it was only fleeting before they took advantage of Dong Sansi’s breath to respond: “We didn’t ask Luo Tian to save us. How can you call us ungrateful?”

“Indeed!” A chorus of agreement echoed from the people behind Lan Yichen.

Lan Yichen’s group used this as an excuse to attack Luo Tian, claiming it was for Luo Tian’s ears but also to ease their conscience.

“Luo Tian, if you’re smart, don’t fight us over this sword. Otherwise, a crowd attack would be bad for you. Though you’re a genius, I believe even with us all attacking, it wouldn’t be easy for you!” Cold Jade Dragon spoke coldly.

“Indeed! You Wuxing Sect is big and powerful; don’t fight us over this Wuhen Dao!” Lan Yichen’s group kept speaking.

Luo Tian, however, remained indifferent as he watched Lan Yichen and Cold Jade Dragon speak.

Hearing these shameless words, Dong Sansi and Wang Tianxiang’s faces turned red, unable to find the right words to describe these people’s shamelessness.

“Finished?” Luo Tian sneered, his eyes flashing like lightning as he glanced at them.

The group speaking before were stunned by this glance, their bodies trembling and ears ringing like thunder. They stared at Luo Tian in shock.

“Sansi, Tianxiang! For these people, there’s only one word: fight. Beat them until they fear you and won’t dare to swagger in front of you!” Luo Tian turned to his group.

Luo Tian’s figure vanished like the wind, appearing before Lan Yichen in a breath. His fist wrapped in energy smashed into Lan Yichen’s chest.

Lan Yichen was still stunned by Luo Tian’s glance, and the next moment felt his chest being smashed. A sound of bones breaking followed.

Luo Tian threw the injured Lan Yichen in front of Dong Sansi and Wang Tianxiang, whispering: “Did you see? Talking to these people is useless!”

Chapter 140: The Fate of the Wuhen Dao

“Smack…” Lan Yichen’s body fell heavily onto Wang Tianxiang’s group, producing a dull sound.

Cold Jade Dragon and others stared in shock at Lan Yichen, their faces trembling.

They had already considered Luo Tian strong, but they hadn’t expected him to be so变态 (abnormal). In their eyes, he had defeated Lan Yichen without even letting them react. Lan Yichen hadn’t even had a chance to fight back.

Wang Tianxiang and Dong Sansi looked at Luo Tian with admiration, this aloof yet thin figure. They then turned their gaze to Lan Yichen lying in pain, a sinister smile on their lips.

Lan Yichen suddenly felt cold all over and looked up at Wang Tianxiang, who smiled at him. A bad feeling flashed through his mind as he stammered: “What are you going to do? I am…”

“What are you?” A slap echoed, and Wang Tianxiang laughed as he swung his hand to hit Lan Yichen’s handsome face.

Dong Sansi and others also sneered, swarming around Lan Yichen to punch and kick him.

Soon, the second level echoed with Lan Yichen’s cries of pain.

Cold Jade Dragon’s eyelid twitched as he watched the pitiful Lan Yichen. He knew that even if they now begged for mercy, Luo Tian wouldn’t let them go. He roared: “First strike is best!”

Cold Jade Dragon was the first to rush toward Luo Tian, his palm wrapped in dense water-element energy and smashing down.

Seeing this, others knew they had already attacked Luo Tian. Even if Luo Tian was patient, he wouldn’t let them go. So they rushed toward him like hungry wolves.

Luo Tian saw the group attacking him and showed no fear. He kicked off the ground, like a tiger, and vanished in a gust of wind to meet their attack.

Soon, the energy fluctuations that had just disappeared returned to the second level tree hole, and this time it was far more violent. Fortunately, the ancient tree was solid due to unknown reasons; otherwise, this massive energy fluctuation would have destroyed it.

Gou Xueming stood on the third level, feeling the energy fluctuations of the second level. His face bore a sinister grin: “Fight! Fight! Once I obtain the most important treasure inside, you’ll all die! Everything will be mine—Gou Xueming’s!”

After saying this, he waved his array banners continuously, scattering them around him and a bronze-colored large cauldron.

…

Luo Tian was facing several body-refining ninth-tier disciples for the first time, though his physique was exceptional, he still felt overwhelmed.

“Smack…” Luo Tian took a hit from one disciple’s Yellow-grade初级 (initial) martial art with his back, then unleashed the Emperor Seal to smash Cold Jade Dragon. He kicked him, and Cold Jade Dragon fell like a dead dog, even more pitiful than Lan Yichen because he had taken the Emperor Seal directly.

Once Cold Jade Dragon was out, others panicked. Luo Tian took a Yellow-grade初级 martial art but seemed unaffected. He roared and rushed toward the remaining disciples.

“Smack… smack…” The sound of bodies hitting the ground echoed in Wang Tianxiang and Dong Sansi’s ears. Whoever was thrown under them lost their ability to fight, only to be beaten by Dong Sansi’s group.

“Smack…” Luo Tian clapped his hands and threw the last person into Dong Sansi’s group.

“I truly didn’t want to fight you over this Wuhen Dao, but you all acted out of jealousy and attacked me. So I had no choice but to fight back!” Luo Tian sighed, not even glancing at the Wuhen Dao in the corner before heading toward the red metal.

The beaten and battered Lan Yichen and Cold Jade Dragon heard Luo Tian’s words, their hearts bitter. They hadn’t expected that he didn’t even value the Wuhen Dao. If they had known this, they wouldn’t have attacked Luo Tian first. What was the point of their current situation?

Thinking this, Lan Yichen and Cold Jade Dragon felt as if they had eaten dirt.

“Hmph! Bastards! Rats raised by dogs!” Wang Tianxiang cursed and kicked down.

After speaking, Luo Tian didn’t care about them anymore because his storage ring’s Rupture Heaven Spear was almost rebelling.

“Buzz…” The Rupture Heaven Spear emitted a light hum, appearing in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Comrade, don’t rush. It’s all yours! Don’t worry!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to the Rupture Heaven Spear, which trembled in his hand.

When he had entered the second level, the Rupture Heaven Spear had been constantly knocking against his storage ring. However, his ring was given by his master; even the Rupture Heaven Spear couldn’t force its way out. It could only call Luo Tian, but at that time he was fighting Cold Jade Dragon and hadn’t had the time to release it.

Luo Tian slowly loosened his grip on the Rupture Heaven Spear, and it shot out like an arrow, plunging into the pile of red metal.

Like a child who hadn’t eaten, the sharpness from the red metal was continuously absorbed into its body.

Luo Tian didn’t know what the red metal was, so he let the Rupture Heaven Spear absorb it. He turned and saw the Wuhen Dao in the corner, then picked it up with his hand.

He lightly swung the Wuhen Dao, and it emitted a series of humming sounds. His spiritual sense probed it; the blade’s path cut through the air as if slicing it apart.

Luo Tian nodded in approval, inwardly praising it was indeed a fine sword. If he hadn’t had the Rupture Heaven Spear, this would have been an excellent weapon.

At that moment, Wang Tianxiang’s group had beaten the others so they couldn’t get up. Hearing the sword’s hum, they looked toward it with fiery eyes.

Luo Tian felt their fire and hesitated about how to divide the Wuhen Dao.

“Dong Sansi, take this sword first!” Luo Tian handed the Wuhen Dao to Dong Sansi.

People have distances; since meeting Dong Sansi in Wuxing Sect’s Dan Pavilion, he had followed Luo Tian. Though Luo Tian sometimes gave him pills, Dong Sansi had endured many hardships for him. These weren’t told to Luo Tian, but he knew them. So Luo Tian decided to give this sword to Dong Sansi.

Chapter 141: Residual Soul Stealing the Body

Dong Sansi instinctively took the Wuhen Dao in his hand, his face filled with excitement.
