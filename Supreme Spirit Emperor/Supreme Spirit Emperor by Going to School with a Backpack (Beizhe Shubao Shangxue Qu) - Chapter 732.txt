“Taicang was merely a subordinate of the Human Emperor back then. Later, he rebelled and declared himself the Eastern Emperor, seizing Mount Donghuang!” Fu Xingyang spoke, his voice laced with fury.

For so many years, Fu Xingyang had been reduced to a wretched state through torment. Yet Donghuang never sought his death—only to unravel the secrets within Fu Xingyang’s bloodline. The seal containing Taicang’s soul was set by the Human Emperor Fuxi himself, and Fu Xingyang’s blood could unlock part of it. Through relentless study, Donghuang eventually uncovered its mysteries, prying open a fragment of the seal to release two-tenths of Taicang’s divine soul.

“I am the true descendant of Fuxi, the Human Emperor! They are merely traitors!” Fu Xingyang declared, his body radiating waves of power. Though faint, it carried an innate authority—a pressure born from bloodline.

These years, Fu Xingyang had been studied relentlessly. Yet he too pondered why they captured him but never killed him, and why his fate was so entwined with Taicang’s seal. Fu Xingyang had once been a god-emperor of the Starmoon Divine Clan; upon reflection, he understood. He also learned more secrets.

Fu Xingyang’s words were quiet but clear, drawing disbelief from the crowd as they gazed at Donghuang Taiyi.

The battlefield fell silent, then erupted into chaos. Murmurs spread among the people.

“How could the Eastern Emperor betray the Human Emperor? But what of Taicang’s soul? For years, we’ve worshipped a false Human Emperor instead of his true spirit!”

“I once heard tales of the Human Emperor’s general, but it was all legend!” A wave of confusion swept through them. Many felt a bitter loss as their faith crumbled.

“Victory belongs to the strong! What can you do? Kill them!” Donghuang roared, ignoring their murmurs. If he cleansed Mount Donghuang, these problems would vanish. The greatest threat was the group led by Luotian—eliminate them all, including Fu Xingyang.

“Do you think I’ve wasted these years in captivity?” Fu Xingyang howled, his eyes blazing with divine light like twin suns.

At the same time, most of Mount Donghuang’s people bore golden seals on their foreheads, flickering ominously.

“Ah! My head hurts!” A voice cried out. From the golden dragon formation, cries of alarm echoed.

Roar…

The gray soul let out a guttural cry. Its forehead bore the seal, and its power rapidly waned.

“Slave Seal!” Donghuang’s eyes widened in terror. He recalled a forbidden ancestral decree, staring at Fu Xingyang’s gaunt form.

Chapter 2783: Eliminate the Eastern Emperor

“How!” Donghuang roared, his fear unmistakable. He felt an unseen influence upon himself—though slight, it was real. This was Fu Xingyang’s weakened state; if he were strong, the Slave Seal’s power would be far greater.

As Donghuang reeled in shock, Luotian’s attack surged again. His fist radiated a celestial tremor, eight shadow fists merging with six swirling vortexes to strike Donghuang’s stunned form.

Crack… The resounding sound finally wounded Donghuang, sending him flying through the heavens. He crashed several leagues away before halting.

“Kill…!” Yao Chen and others struck again. As Fu Xingyang activated the Slave Seal, Taicang’s soul no longer aided Mount Donghuang’s people. They fell back into disadvantage.

Cough… Cough…

Donghuang spat blood, stabilizing in the sky. His wounds healed rapidly. As he steadied himself, Luotian’s attack came again.

The thunderous clash echoed once more. Blood splattered as both sides clashed fiercely. Yet within minutes, a corpse of an intermediate Immortal King fell from the sky, crashing into the earth.

“Another death!”

“Hold on—reinforcements are coming!” Donghuang barked, watching the tortured Taicang soul.

“You should worry about yourself!” As Donghuang’s words ended, a cold voice echoed in his ears.

Fists flashed. Luotian’s furious assault returned, clashing with Donghuang again. Luotian sighed inwardly at Donghuang’s might, a veteran powerhouse still resisting his attacks.

Time passed. Though Donghuang could withstand Luotian’s assault, others were not so lucky. The battlefield saw one side overwhelming the other. In under a quarter-hour, five more intermediate Immortal Kings fell.

“Elder Brother, time is up!” Long Jie shouted, smashing an intermediate Immortal King and addressing Luotian.

“Fine. Prepare to retreat!” Luotian relayed mentally to the group, pondering a final gift for Donghuang.

He shifted from attack to defense, raising three-colored lightning in his palm. Both Luotian and Donghuang were battered. Seeing Luotian’s slowed attack, Donghuang hesitated his assault. He no longer sought to capture Luotian’s group but aimed to minimize Mount Donghuang’s losses. The two-tenths of Taicang’s soul had vanished, absorbed by Fu Xingyang.

“Damn it!” Donghuang’s face darkened. The two-tenths of Taicang’s soul, even he found it troublesome. It had taken years to unlock through Fu Xingyang’s bloodline—now it had benefited Fu Xingyang.

“Donghuang Taiyi!” As Donghuang’s expression darkened, a shout echoed in his ears. His attention shifted to Luotian.

In that moment, Donghuang’s vision met a pair of golden eyes. As he gazed into them, his mind wavered, dizziness overtaking him. This sensation made his heart lurch—this moment of confusion was dangerous, especially against Luotian.

Crash… As Donghuang regained his senses, thunderous noise filled his ears. A searing pain shot through his body. As he clashed with Luotian’s lightning, in the crowd’s shock, Donghuang’s arm was reduced to bloody flesh and continued to decay.

“Go!” Luotian roared. Yaoke, Long Jie, and others didn’t linger, regrouping with Luotian.

“Last strike!” Luotian sneered, lightning surging to strike Mount Donghuang.

The entire Mount Donghuang was engulfed in terrifying lightning. Luotian’s group vanished into the sky, leaving Mount Donghuang to its fate.

Fifteen people emerged unscathed, with only minor injuries. After an hour of flight, they reached a mountain peak. Wan Lingkong activated the formation, and they vanished through the teleportation array.

Apocalypse—terrible lightning ravaged Mount Donghuang. The mountain lay in ruins, more terrifyingly, half of Donghuang Taiyi’s body was gone. Though he lived, he had suffered grievous wounds.

Lightning faded. The people of Mount Donghuang stared in terror at their ruined domain.

Donghuang fell from the sky, crashing onto a peak. His face was deathly pale, still surrounded by lightning.

Zong…

As Donghuang landed on the peak, a figure appeared before him—green robes. Upon seeing Mount Donghuang’s state, his eyes narrowed slightly.

“Taiyi Brother!” The figure appeared before Donghuang Taiyi, surprise in his gaze.

“Yongsheng!” Donghuang spoke weakly but with fear. If it were anyone else, he would not care—even the King of Ghosts would be ignored. But Yongsheng Immortal King, a peak-level immortal, eluded his comprehension.

“Where is Luotian?”

“Taiyi Brother, how did you come to this state?” Yongsheng Immortal King’s face showed concern. He hadn’t expected to find Donghuang in such a state.

“He left. He truly has risen!” Donghuang’s face showed admiration. This time, he had been wounded at the core and would need years to recover.

“No problem. I will avenge you!” Yongsheng Immortal King’s gaze turned to Donghuang Taiyi, extending a hand to support him.

Zong…

In an instant, Yongsheng Immortal King struck. A black claw shot from his front, striking Donghuang.

“You…” Donghuang’s eyes widened. Before he could finish, Yongsheng Immortal King’s hand shattered Donghuang’s head.

“Taiyi Brother, what happened?” Yongsheng Immortal King shouted. An invisible suction emanated from him, as if drawing unseen power into his body.

Yongsheng Immortal King’s attack was lightning-fast, no one could see it clearly. None expected him to strike at this moment.

“Thank you. I will truly avenge you!” Yongsheng Immortal King licked his lips, eyes showing sorrow.

Chapter 2784: Meet Bubian Immortal King

Shocked. Tianyuan Sect attacked Mount Donghuang, six Immortal Kings fell—even the peak-level immortal Donghuang Taiyi was slain. How could Tianyuan Sect have grown so strong?

Donghuang Taiyi’s death sent a storm through the Immortal Realm. Everyone gasped, as if hell had learned of the execution of its ruler.

Luotian killed Donghuang Taiyi! And Luotian’s name spread—no one could believe he was the killer. In Tianyuan Sect, Luotian and others received news but couldn’t smile. According to Luotian, his lightning palm had wounded Donghuang but could not kill him.

“Who struck?” Luotian reviewed the events after leaving Mount Donghuang. The message also detailed what happened afterward—several peak-level immortals arrived but left shortly.

“They must be the ones who struck!” Luotian said, frowning. This was clearly a frame-up.

“Still, we’ve probably intimidated them thoroughly,” Diao Dezhu said with pride. “A peak-level immortal and six intermediate ones—other sects would think twice before challenging Tianyuan Sect.”

“But I fear…” Jiang Nanxuan whispered, but said nothing more. The situation was clearly favorable for Tianyuan Sect.

“Hmph. Let you handle it now. I need to return to Hell. The Yinhun and Bailang there need help. Run, you should come with me too.”

“Strengthen relations with the Central Heaven Consortium. Development of the Central Three Heavens depends on it. As for the other matters, handle them as you see fit—don’t back down. Who dares to move, strike back! With me and the ancient ancestors watching, no one would dare challenge Tianyuan Sect!” Luotian assigned tasks. He felt something big was about to happen—Luoshengmen was the real enemy.

A sense of urgency gripped Luotian. Yang Huanyu had built such a massive force for Luoshengmen—there must be intent. He remembered the past with Wangyue Sect.

After assigning tasks, Luotian departed the next day, re-entering the Upper Three Heavens. Now, there were no barriers between the Upper and Central Three Heavens. One could tear through space anywhere, as long as one knew the direction.

In three days, Luotian reached Bubian Mountain. His face bore respect.

Bubian Immortal King, like Yinhun and Bailang, had greatly aided Luotian. Thus, Luotian held deep gratitude for Bubian Immortal King.

As soon as Luotian appeared, the people of Bubian Mountain noticed. Now, Luotian was no longer a novice—his status as an Immortal King peak-level made him respected. They rushed out to greet him.

“Respected elders, it’s been a while!” Luotian bowed respectfully. Regardless of his status, he maintained courtesy.

“Polite! Now Tianyuan Sect dominates the realm. Your name is renowned!” Several elders smiled, bowing to Luotian as they escorted him into the palace.

In the hall, Bubian Immortal King sat. Others retreated, leaving only Luotian and Bubian Immortal King.

“Respectful elder!” Luotian bowed, adopting a more respectful demeanor.

“You’ve grown. Even I can’t match you now!” Bubian Immortal King spoke, his eyes showing satisfaction.

“Whatever your command, I will obey without hesitation!” Luotian replied, expressing his stance.

“You speak well. You must have a request for me!” Bubian Immortal King chuckled, knowing Luotian had something to ask.

“I wish to borrow a person from you—Jiang Yuanxiong!” Luotian’s face showed embarrassment. He stopped praising and addressed Bubian Immortal King.

“That one is beyond my control!” Bubian Immortal King smiled, handing Luotian a teacup.

“Fortuitously, you’ve come. I have something to say!” Bubian Immortal King didn’t wait for Luotian’s response, his expression turning serious.

“Speak, elder!” Luotian straightened, gazing at Bubian Immortal King. Now an Immortal King peak-level, he felt a vague premonition.

“Catastrophe is near. I’ve lived too long; I fear I won’t see Xiaoji fully independent!” Bubian Immortal King sighed. His “Xiaoji” was Jiang Yuzhe.

“Yongsheng Immortal King may have a major move. Be cautious, especially against us. Among the peak-level immortals of the Immortal Realm, Yongsheng is the most enigmatic. I suspect Donghuang was killed by him!” Bubian Immortal King spoke, making Luotian’s heart tighten.

Initially, Luotian hadn’t taken Yongsheng Immortal King seriously. He valued Yang Huanyu more, knowing him well. As for Yongsheng Immortal King, Luotian knew he was powerful but wasn’t afraid. Once Tianyuan Sect stabilized, he planned to visit Yongsheng Mountain to avenge Zhang Daotian.

“I once calculated an omen. A great calamity will come to the Immortal Realm, and the Ghost Valley’s descendant is the variable. When Ghost Valley appears, the world changes!”

“Yet others believe you are this calamity. But I felt in my heart, you are the variable—born for this change!” Bubian Immortal King gazed deeply at Luotian.

“Huh…” Luotian was stunned. He hadn’t expected Bubian Immortal King to value him so highly, like Yinhun and Bailang.

“Elder, what can I do?” Luotian asked earnestly. He listened carefully to Bubian Immortal King’s teachings, sensing this old man possessed great wisdom and excelled in divination—surely he could foresee much.

“Enhance your strength. Any calamity requires strengthening it. The rest will follow naturally!” Bubian Immortal King spoke softly, echoing Yinhun and Bailang’s words.

“Good!” Luotian nodded. He continued conversing with Bubian Immortal King for a while before exiting the hall.

“Little Tian!” As Luotian emerged, three figures appeared—his three elder brothers, Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen.

“Respectful elder!” Luotian bowed. Now, their strength was formidable—each at the intermediate Immortal King level. Clearly, Bubian Mountain had cultivated them.

The four brothers hadn’t seen each other in a while. Naturally, they had much to say. Luotian was pulled by Lei Yong to Zhang Ziping’s residence.

“Little Tian, you’ve become a peak-level immortal. Can we finally settle accounts with Yongsheng?” Lei Yong spoke immediately upon entering the courtyard, his resentment long-held.

Chapter 2785: Chuchen

“Sigh…” Hearing Lei Yong’s words, Luotian sighed. He had planned to avenge before, but after speaking with Bubian Immortal King, he decided to wait until returning from Hell.

“Wait a bit longer. Wait for the master’s return!” Luotian spoke, gazing at Lei Yong and Ji Chen.

“Okay…” Hearing Luotian’s words, Lei Yong’s face drooped. He looked at Luotian in confusion.

“Yongsheng isn’t as simple as we thought!” Luotian spoke, recounting Bubian Immortal King’s words to Zhang Ziping and Lei Yong.

“Ah, then wait a bit more!” Lei Yong sighed. They had lived in Bubian Mountain for years, knowing Bubian Immortal King’s strength—not from power but his divination skills.

“This grudge will be avenged eventually. It’s not far off. We’ve waited centuries, so a few decades won’t matter!” Luotian spoke.

“Indeed. Let’s drink! When you return, we’ll kill Yongsheng Mountain!” Lei Yong laughed, not too concerned.

Time passed. Luotian stayed in Bubian Mountain for five days, meeting Jiang Yuzhe and Ye Liangchen briefly before leaving with Jiang Yuanxiong.

“You little bastard! Do you have to ask like this?” Jiang Yuanxiong cursed, bound and dragged by Luotian toward the Central Three Heavens.

“Elder, you’re not cooperating. I have no choice; someone is waiting for rescue!” Luotian spoke, addressing Jiang Yuanxiong.

Luotian spent five days in Bubian Mountain. One day was dedicated to inviting Jiang Yuanxiong, but he refused to leave, engrossed in research. He made Luotian wait two years, so he had no choice but to bind Jiang Yuanxiong.

Flying through the sky, Luotian quickly arrived at the Central Three Heavens. He glanced at Tianyuan Sect’s people, finding no major issues before entering Hell with Jiang Yuanxiong and Run Hongyu.

Hell was now chaotic. The Ten Courts of Yama, Eight Heavenly Kings—all had fallen. Many cities were unmanaged, and some with prior conflicts directly clashed.

This situation was common across Hell. On the way, Luotian saw many but didn’t pay much attention—still observing slightly.

That day, Luotian flew under the sky but suddenly stopped. His gaze met two fighting figures—someone he had nearly forgotten.

“Chuchen!” Luotian’s eyes showed joy, standing in the sky without attacking. He observed.

When Luotian fell into the蛮族大陆, his first encounter was with Chuchen of the Stone Clan. They were like brothers. Later, Luotian ascended to immortality and entered the Immortal Realm. He thought he’d never meet again, but here they were.

On black earth, dozens fought fiercely. Chuchen’s tall figure stood out. However, he was the one under attack.

“Kid, now you can join us Black Ghost City!” A youth shouted, gazing at the group surrounding Chuchen.

“You… dare?” Chuchen, bloodied but resolute, spoke loudly.

“Then we’ll kill you!” Dozens raised their voices, flying toward Chuchen.

“Brothers, go first!” Chuchen barked. His aura surged, his tall body emitting a crackling sound as he transformed into a蛮族 giant, standing at the front of his group.

“Big size means nothing!” Dozens sneered. Chuchen looked intimidating but was only at the intermediate Celestial King level.

Waves surged. Several martial arts techniques struck Chuchen, which would kill an intermediate Celestial King. Yet Chuchen was wounded.

“Die!” Chuchen barked, his massive body blocking the attacks. His two hands struck each technique.

Hundred feet… Ten feet…

As the techniques neared Chuchen, the world suddenly stilled. Luotian stopped observing and descended to Chuchen’s front.

“Disperse!” Luotian spoke softly. The techniques shattered, releasing thick ghost qi.

He established a domain, encompassing ten thousand feet, controlling all within. Even an intermediate Immortal King would be affected here.

“Elder!” Chuchen’s eyes widened in disbelief, seeing Luotian appear. He hadn’t expected to meet him here.

“Good brother!” Luotian patted Chuchen’s shoulder, smiling. They embraced fiercely.

“These people are mine!” Luotian smiled, gazing at those who had attacked Chuchen.

“You… who are you? We’re from Black Ghost City!” A leader stammered, feeling gripped by an invisible hand.

“Oh…” Luotian nodded. He pointed his finger, and dozens turned to blood mist.

“Done. Come with me!” Luotian gazed at Chuchen, who was too weak in this chaotic Hell. One mistake could cost his life.

“Elder, help me!” Chuchen spoke, looking at Luotian with a pitiful gaze.

“Stupid kid. You’re my brother. Lead the way!” Luotian smiled, waving his hand. Chuchen and his group flew up.

“West… the Ascending Sky City…” Chuchen pointed, indicating a city unseen by others. Luotian saw it faintly.

Luotian stepped forward, instantly arriving above the city. The aura of an Immortal King descended, halting both sides in fear.

“This is the aura of an Immortal King! A great immortal must have passed through this Ascending Sky City!” The city’s people couldn’t speak.

“Who needs to be dealt with?” Luotian asked, uninterested. If Chuchen wished, he could kill all in the city with a thought.

“He!” Chuchen pointed at a middle-aged man. Before he finished, the man exploded into blood mist.

“Him too…” Chuchen kept pointing. Blood mists rose in Ascending Sky City.

“Who are the three with him?” Others gazed in disbelief. They knew Chuchen but not this godlike man.

Chapter 2786: Settle Affairs

In Ascending Sky City, blood mists rose constantly. Each time Chuchen pointed at someone, they died—his words became law. The city’s people trembled.

Within an hour, most of Black Ghost City’s forces were eliminated. The city’s people gazed at Luotian as if he were a god.

“Done, little Chen. Anything else?” Luotian smiled, gazing at Chuchen.

“Elder, go… I don’t want to leave…” Chuchen blushed, gazing at a woman by the city’s leader.

The woman was pretty, wearing long robes. She looked somewhat dirty. Seeing Luotian’s gaze, she stepped behind the city leader.

“Oh?” Luotian immediately understood. He smiled.

“What’s your name?” Luotian asked Chuchen, making his face redder.

“She’s Tian Yun. I fell into Ascending Sky City and became her guard, then…” Chuchen stammered, his voice fading.

“Haha! Good job, brother. You’ve got the same spirit as me. I started as a guard and won over my wife, right?” Luotian laughed. Seeing Chuchen find his love, he was happy and respected his choice.

“If you’ve decided to stay, I won’t force you,” Luotian gazed at Tian Yun.

“Little sister, first meeting. Here’s a gift!” Luotian and Run Hongyu descended, suppressing their aura but still making the city’s people tremble.

“This…” Tian Yun was very nervous, clutching her robe. She gazed at Chuchen.

“Take it. This is my elder, Luotian!” Chuchen smiled, leading Tian Yun to Luotian.

“Luotian!” Hearing Chuchen’s words, everyone’s faces changed. They gazed at Luotian standing there with a smile.

Luotian’s name was known everywhere. Even if they were small, they had heard of his fame and deeds.

“City leader, I truly wish to marry Tian Yun. Please bless us!” Chuchen addressed the city leader.

“Of course, of course! I’ll bless it!” The middle-aged man said. Luotian’s gaze shifted to him, nearly wetting his pants.

Zong… As the city leader spoke, Luotian raised his hand. He sent a series of mid-level ghost weapons to Tian Yun.

“Hastily came, no preparations. Don’t be offended. These will do for now. When I return, I’ll prepare better!” Luotian smiled, giving Tian Yun a set of mid-level ghost weapons.

Hearing this, everyone’s hearts tightened. A single mid-level ghost weapon was precious for them—let alone a set, which was rare.

“This high-level ghost weapon’s flying sword is the dowry!” Luotian added, handing a flying sword to the city leader.

“This…” The city leader’s face changed. He dared not accept the high-level flying sword, which was too precious.

“Take it!” Luotian forced the sword into the city leader’s hand. He also gave Chuchen an storage ring, patting his shoulder. Nine lightning bolts were sealed into Chuchen’s body.

“Elder has business, so I must leave. If trouble arises, take my token to the Wheel Turning Palace; they’ll help you. But it’s better for you to stay here,” Luotian said, settling Chuchen but ensuring his safety.

“Hmph. Don’t say family matters. I don’t believe I’ll have trouble and you’ll stand by!” Luotian patted Chuchen’s shoulder.

“Good luck. I hope to see your son next time!” Luotian laughed, flying off with Run Hongyu and Jiang Yuanxiong. They vanished from Chuchen’s sight.

As for Ascending Sky City, Luotian didn’t care. He trusted Chuchen; a small city wouldn’t trouble him. And the means and resources he left for Chuchen were enough to let him reach Immortal King.

Luotian’s group flew for two more days, finally reaching the Wheel Turning Palace. Luotian’s return naturally caused a stir—after all, he had said he’d bring people to heal the palace leader.

“Luotian! You’ve finally returned!” Du Jianhang’s group, eyes filled with joy, pulled Luotian into the Wheel Turning Palace.

“What happened?” Luotian felt a chill. Such urgency from these old men meant something big had occurred.

As he pondered, they pulled him into the layer where Yinhun and Bailang resided. Seeing their state, he understood why these old men were so anxious.

The last layer of the Wheel Turning Palace held a gaunt figure seated. His body was pale, like a corpse drained of blood.

“What happened? You said you could still endure!” Luotian rushed to Yinhun and Bailang but found them unable to respond.

“After you left, they were fine for a few days. But soon after, the leader’s aura dropped—his body seemed drained completely. He declined day by day!” Du Jianhang spoke.

“Luotian, save the leader!” Others spoke, gazing at Luotian. They knew he was a cultivator.

“Elder, Hongyu, come see!” Luotian didn’t delay. He called Jiang Yuanxiong and Run Hongyu.

Sigh… Upon entering, their faces turned grave. They inhaled sharply—Yinhun and Bailang’s appearance was terrifying.

“What kind of injury is this?” Jiang Yuanxiong frowned, staring at Yinhun and Bailang. Run Hongyu and Luotian observed them carefully, hoping to find a clue or any remaining life.

“This is…” Run Hongyu suddenly gasped but stopped, gazing deeply at Luotian.

“Ah…”

“Master, you all leave first. The rest is ours!” Luotian understood Run Hongyu’s gaze and spoke to Du Jianhang. Though unsure why, he followed Run Hongyu’s advice.

Chapter 2787: Ten-Grade Elixir

“Not allowed! I don’t trust!” Hearing Luotian’s words, the old men of the Wheel Turning Palace roared. Though Hell and the Immortal Realm were temporarily at peace, it didn’t mean their hatred had vanished.

“Old fool!” Luotian muttered, gazing at the old men. He couldn’t help but speak.

“Go! All of you, leave. With me here, what could happen?”

“Would you take responsibility for delaying matters?” Luotian spoke, finally gazing at Du Jianhang.

“Go!” Du Jianhang wouldn’t undermine Luotian, leading them out of the Wheel Turning Palace.

Only Luotian, Jiang Yuanxiong, and Run Hongyu remained. Their gazes fell on Run Hongyu.

To cultivate elixirs, Luotian and Jiang Yuanxiong could, but for medicine, it was Run Hongyu.

“His soul is poisoned!” Run Hongyu spoke. He extended a golden needle, sending a glint into Yinhun and Bailang’s foreheads. Luotian and Jiang Yuanxiong both felt a jolt—had Hell’s people seen this, they would have gone mad.

Zong…

As Run Hongyu’s golden needle fell, a wave gathered at Yinhun and Bailang’s foreheads. Luotian and Jiang Yuanxiong clearly saw their blood vessels protruding—purple, abnormal.

“Poison. If it were normal, it would be fine. But the elder was already severely wounded—this poison spread faster!” Run Hongyu spoke.

“Adding insult to injury…” Luotian worried, then shook his head.

“What poisoned him?” Luotian thought of a more serious issue. Yinhun and Bailang hadn’t been poisoned when they returned from the Equal Palace.

“I sent them out for this reason. I suspect there’s a traitor in the Wheel Turning Palace!” Run Hongyu spoke.

“First, find a way to save him. Any ideas?” Luotian gazed at them. Yinhun and Bailang’s condition was truly challenging.

“Find a way, but it’s too hard!” Jiang Yuanxiong frowned, thinking.

“This poison isn’t difficult. If I’m not mistaken, it’s the Shadowless Silkworm’s poison. Find it and you can remove it!”

“But now his condition is very poor. Removing the Shadowless Silkworm would trigger a chain reaction!” Run Hongyu spoke.

“Recovery Elixir!” As Run Hongyu’s words ended, Jiang Yuanxiong spoke loudly.

“I am a nine-grade elixir master. But like cultivation, there’s no end to the Dao. I’ve always wanted to research a ten-grade immortal elixir!”

“I just had some ideas, and you pulled it out!” Jiang Yuanxiong cursed, slapping Luotian’s head.

“Did you master a ten-grade elixir?” Hearing Jiang Yuanxiong, Luotian and Run Hongyu showed disbelief, gazing at him.

Treasure. Jiang Yuanxiong was truly a treasure. A nine-grade elixir master was rare, let alone ten-grade—unheard of.

“Don’t get too excited. Ten-grade elixirs aren’t easy to research. I’ve only created a prototype. To succeed, it needs continuous trials—at least ten to eight years! Can he endure that?” Jiang Yuanxiong spoke, gazing at Yinhun and Bailang.

“Don’t say ten years. A month might not even last!” Luotian sighed. Yinhun and Bailang’s condition was too poor.

“So, no hope?” Run Hongyu asked, gazing at Jiang Yuanxiong. Luotian’s gaze also fell on him.

“……”
