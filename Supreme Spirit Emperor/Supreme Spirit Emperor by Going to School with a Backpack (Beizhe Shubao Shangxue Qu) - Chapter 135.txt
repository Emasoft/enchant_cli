“First, I shall pass on my life's cultivation to you!” Jin Le Ren chuckled softly, his gaze gentle. “Though you cannot yet refine it now, it will bring boundless benefits to your future cultivation!”

At this moment, Jin Le Ren regarded Luo Tian as his disciple. He pressed a finger to the air, and a golden dragon coiled within his palm before condensing into a golden pearl. He then implanted it into Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian's heart trembled violently. He could sense the pearl contained an immense reservoir of energy, so formidable that even his current self struggled to refine it.

At the same time, he noticed Jin Le Ren’s own energy had dwindled to a mere thread, and his face bore a faint pallor.

“The second is my Break-Chain Scripture!” Jin Le Ren’s voice carried a hint of amusement as he pressed his fingertip to Luo Tian’s forehead. A sequence of hand seals materialized within Luo Tian’s mind.

Before Luo Tian could react, Jin Le Ren spoke again. His gaze turned solemn as he looked at Luo Tian.

“The third is the Primordial Chaos Energy I’ve cultivated. Accepting it makes you my true disciple!”

“By releasing the Primordial Chaos Energy, I shall vanish from the Xian Gu continent forever. Only my physical body will remain here. After you depart, place my corpse at this Dao-Seeking Cliff to guard it,” Jin Le Ren said with a relieved smile.

“Senior, you—” Luo Tian opened his mouth but found himself at a loss for words.

“No need to burden yourself. In truth, I am originally from the Ru Xian realm. I merely relied on this Dao-Seeking Cliff’s array and a thread of Primordial Chaos Energy to generate a fragment of my soul every millennium,” Jin Le Ren understood Luo Tian’s concern and nodded gently, his gaze now more approving.

“Enough! My time is limited. Begin!” Jin Le Ren smiled again, pressing a finger to the air once more. A wisp of gray energy escaped his palm.

Chapter 661: Success

Chapter 661: Success

On the Xian Gu continent, at the Dao-Seeking Cliff, those ranked outside the top hundred bore expressions of frustration and anticipation as they gazed at the one hundred cave entrances.

“Who do you think will inherit the Twelve Emperors’ legacy?” Wang Tianxiang stood among the crowd, his expression expectant as he surveyed the cave entrances. Yet no one dared imagine who could obtain the inheritance of the界尊 (Jie Zun), the supreme being in the world.

“Naturally, it must be the top twelve geniuses. Others can only watch,” a genius from Changsheng Dao Sect smiled and replied.

At this time, the people from the Northern Region, due to Luo Tian’s connection, had become familiar with each other. Even some sects from the Eastern Region had gathered with them, whispering among themselves.

“Hum…” As they discussed, one cave entrance emitted a resonant hum. A barrier sealed the entrance, leaving everyone astonished.

“This is Luo Tian’s cave! Has he obtained the inheritance?” The Northern Region people wore expressions of joy, gazing at the sealed entrance.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian sat in a grand hall. Beside him stood an elderly man whose face bore signs of weakness, like wisps of gray energy escaping from his fingers.

At the same time Luo Tian received Jin Le Ren’s inheritance, other cave entrances also changed. Seven of them—where geniuses had been battling the elderly man—suddenly lost their opponents, standing in bewilderment.

“Return!” Jin Le Ren smiled. Seven white figures materialized before him, their hands releasing wisps of gray energy. Though thinner than Jin Le Ren’s own, they were even finer than hair strands, nearly invisible to the naked eye.

“What's going on?” The seven geniuses, who had lost their opponents, were teleported out of the hall. Their respective cave entrances vanished from sight.

“Did these seven fail?” When people saw them emerge, they surrounded the seven and questioned them.

The seven geniuses were crestfallen, their faces filled with resentment. After pushing through countless obstacles, they had failed at the last moment.

“Hum…” Another cave entrance sealed itself before the crowd’s eyes, causing another wave of astonishment.

“This is Tian Luo’s cave!” People murmured. As the words fell, seven more figures emerged from the cave entrance. The ones they had entered also disappeared.

“Damn it! I wasted my time here!” Zheng Xin cursed, standing before the vanished cave entrance.

“Enough arguing. It’s just your bad luck—drawn against Tian Luo!” Chen Zhanbiao grumbled, gnawing on a beast’s leg.

Time passed. More cave entrances sealed one after another, with people being teleported out. Even figures like Gu Qianxue were sent away, leaving the crowd in awe of the difficulty of the Twelve Emperors’ inheritance.

Luo Tian sat on the ground, his energy flowing with rhythm. Yet he felt elated—his seven soul fragments, previously scarce in gray Primordial Chaos Energy, had now clearly grown stronger after Jin Le Ren’s infusion.

The seven-colored soul fragments darkened slightly but appeared remarkably agile. Luo Tian knew his soul had become stronger. If he unleashed the Soul-Consuming Art, he felt no fear against a魂凝初期 (Soul Consolidation Initial) cultivator.

Time passed. Jin Le Ren’s seven soul fragments vanished, merging into his physical body.

“Hmph… kid, go vie for Jiang Hongsheng’s inheritance. You have a great chance!” Jin Le Ren smiled, sitting opposite Luo Tian. His face bore a hint of reluctance as he gazed around the hall before closing his eyes.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s body emitted waves. He opened his eyes, golden light radiating as he gazed at Jin Le Ren with complex emotions.

“Thank you, Senior!” Luo Tian bowed. He knew Jin Le Ren had truly given him all his inheritance—even the coveted Primordial Chaos Energy. He didn’t know how to repay such a debt.

At the moment Luo Tian bowed, teleportation energy surged again, carrying him out of the array.

“Here it comes?” As Luo Tian landed, a calm voice echoed in his ear. Tian Luo appeared before him with a smile.

“Senior Tian Luo!” Luo Tian clasped his fists. He marveled at Tian Luo’s strength. If there was anyone who could obtain the Jie Zun’s inheritance, it would be this formidable Tian Luo.

At that moment, Tian Luo’s aura was unstable—evidently from a recent breakthrough. Luo Tian knew Tian Luo, who had previously been at Soul Consolidation Initial, now reached Soul Consolidation Intermediate.

Teleportation energy fell again. The figures before Luo Tian and Tian Luo gradually increased.

The first to emerge was Xiu, then Zhou Ziyang. Others like Leng Qiuchan followed in sequence.

As people emerged, they surveyed the environment. The hall was ordinary, except for a high seat at its center that radiated an unusual aura.

“You twelve are remarkable. Reaching this far proves your strength and talent!” A calm voice echoed. A translucent figure materialized before the twelve.

“But the next trial will be far more difficult—perhaps even life-threatening. If you wish to withdraw, you may,” the figure transformed into a tangible form, leaving Luo Tian and others bewildered.

“This must be the cave’s guardian spirit,” Luo Tian frowned slightly, his expression puzzled. He felt the figure was familiar but couldn’t recall where he had seen it.

“You have one hour to consider. If you choose to withdraw, I will send you away,” the cave guardian spirit smiled.

The group exchanged glances. After a brief contemplation, they wore determined expressions.

“Cultivators walk the edge of death, seeking that one chance at immortality. To hesitate is to not deserve the title!” Shangguan Hongtu stepped forward, his gaze resolute.

Chapter 662: Danger

Seeing Shangguan Hongtu and Luo Han’s battle-ready eyes, Luo Tian nodded slightly. These were the prodigies of their time. Though they had faced setbacks, their indomitable spirit and belief in victory were rare treasures—essential for cultivation.

“Good. Since none of you wish to retreat, I won’t force you. After staying here so long, I’d like to take a walk. Whoever truly inherits the master’s legacy becomes my master. This cave shall then belong to you!” The cave guardian spirit spoke, its face smiling.

Hearing this, others wore expressions of surprise. This Dao-Seeking Cliff was a cave with immeasurable value—none among them remained unmoved.

“Hum…”

The cave guardian spirit waved its hand, and a cave entrance appeared before Luo Tian’s group.

“Enter. If you pass, you’ll inherit the master’s legacy and become my master!” The cave guardian spirit spoke calmly.

“Swoosh…”

Shangguan Hongtu’s face showed urgency. He rushed forward as a black mist, charging into the cave entrance.

“Pound!” But instantly, Xiu appeared before Shangguan Hongtu. With a kick, he sent him flying back.

“Xiu! What—” Shangguan Hongtu was stunned. He hadn’t expected Xiu to attack him.

“Haha, Shangguan Hongtu, I’ll go first!” Luo Han laughed coldly, dashing like an ice arrow toward the cave entrance.

“Luo Han, come back!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He activated the Six Steps of Sealing Heaven, appearing before the cave entrance and pulling Luo Han back.

Luo Han’s face showed confusion. He glared at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with anger: “Luo Tian, don’t push too far. Though your lineage is now the main branch, this Jie Zun inheritance is open to all. Why block me!”

Luo Han was at his wit’s end, his face flushed red. If Luo Tian didn’t give him a perfect explanation, he would definitely turn hostile.

“Idiot, Luo Tian saved you!” Tian Luo spoke coldly, his gaze disdainful toward Luo Han.

Hearing Tian Luo’s words, others wore puzzled expressions. Though they might not believe it, Tian Luo was the strongest among them—making their doubt inevitable.

Shangguan Hongtu and Luo Han’s angry expressions softened after Tian Luo’s words, their gazes now wary toward Tian Luo.

“You?” The cave guardian spirit saw no one entering the cave, its voice now anxious.

“Why do you scheme against us? Just drive us out! Why go to such lengths!” Tian Luo’s face bore a mocking expression.

“Haha, why scheme? Is it necessary?” The cave guardian spirit’s voice returned to calmness. It sat on the chair, its face appearing gentle.

“Enough of this! I’ve never seen a servant sit on their master’s seat!” Tian Luo glared at the cave guardian spirit.

Hearing Tian Luo, people wore expressions of sudden understanding. Since ancient times, no sect had been without strict hierarchy. The cave guardian spirit was clearly a servant of the Jie Zun Jiang Hongsheng. How could it dare sit on the master’s seat, even if the Jie Zun had been dead for years?

“Stop pretending!” Tian Luo smiled, his body flashing forward to the chair. He punched it.

“Damn you! You’ll all die!” The cave guardian spirit’s face showed hatred, its cold gaze toward the boy who had exposed it.

Hearing Tian Luo’s words, Shangguan Hongtu and Luo Han wore complex expressions. They looked at Xiu and Luo Tian, especially Luo Han, who had never accepted Luo Tian’s superiority. Now that the cave guardian spirit revealed its sinister intent, it was clear this entrance wasn’t safe.

“Thanks,” Luo Han muttered quietly, his gaze showing gratitude.

Luo Tian didn’t care. He turned his gaze toward Tian Luo. At that moment, Tian Luo was already battling the cave guardian spirit. Their fight left Luo Tian and others with expressions of concern.

Tian Luo was immensely powerful, but the cave guardian spirit seemed fearless. No matter how Tian Luo attacked, it felt as if he had struck nothing. This frustrated Tian Luo.

Yet the cave guardian spirit possessed no offensive means either, and it didn’t even bother with Tian Luo’s attacks. It only stared at him with a sinister expression.

“You’ll all die! Though you’ve surprised me, if I succeed, you’ll all perish!” The cave guardian spirit spoke with disdain.

“Senior Tian Luo, leave it to me!” Luo Tian sneered. He unleashed a powerful suction force and fired the Reincarnation Fist.

The Reincarnation Passage appeared, causing the cave guardian spirit’s image to tremble. It then wore an expression of fear.

“Kid! What is this? Get it back!” The cave guardian spirit shouted.

“Good,” Luo Tian sneered. His hands released a flourishing green-blue flame, enveloping the cave guardian spirit. His gaze carried mockery.

Seeing Luo Tian’s technique, Tian Luo wore an expression of surprise—especially the green-blue flame. Even he felt a hint of fear.

The green-blue flame formed a cage, trapping the cave guardian spirit. It couldn’t move an inch.

“Speak! What’s your scheme!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, his eyes filled with killing intent. If not for their caution, they might have fallen into the cave guardian spirit’s trap.

“You are Luo Tian? Seven-element体质 (seven-element body)? Good. If you submit to me, I won’t kill you. And you all—submit now, and it’s not too late. Otherwise, when I become a Jie Zun-level powerhouse, you’ll have no chance—no chance of survival!” The cave guardian spirit, after a moment of fear, wore an overconfident expression.

“Answer me!” Luo Tian ignored the cave guardian spirit’s words. He grabbed his hand, and the green-blue flame cage contracted slightly.

The green-blue flame touched the cave guardian spirit’s body, causing it to emit screams.

“Haha! Want answers? Wait until I truly become a human. Then you’ll know. At that time, all of you will die! All of you!” The cave guardian spirit roared madly.

“Sss…” Luo Tian sighed, his hand clenching into a fist. In an instant, the cave guardian spirit turned into a wisp of smoke and vanished.

Apologies for visiting the hospital today. The update is slightly late. To compensate, I’ll publish early! Starting today, six updates daily for five days to fulfill previous promises. This is the first update!

Chapter 663: Puppet Stone Statues

Seeing Luo Tian ruthlessly destroy the cave guardian spirit, people wore expressions of surprise.

“This was only a fragment of the cave guardian spirit. His true self must be doing something else. Considering how the cave guardian spirit killed a soul-fragment initial genius in the first trial, we are truly in danger now!” Luo Tian explained.

Hearing this, the twelve people wore solemn expressions. The grand hall grew heavy with tension. They recalled how a soul-fragment initial genius had been killed for merely speaking ill of Jiang Hongsheng. None among them could match this power.

“What do we do?” Chen Changsheng asked, looking at Luo Tian. Among the group, he was closest to Luo Tian; others, he didn’t fully trust.

“First, quickly find the cave guardian spirit and destroy it. Second, locate an exit to leave the Dao-Seeking Cliff!” Xiu said calmly.

“Correct,” Luo Tian sighed, feeling the danger and helplessness. He gazed at the walls imbued with arrays, his face showing resignation.

Before them was only a black cave entrance. Looking at it felt like gazing into a blood-filled maw, instilling fear.

Luo Tian surveyed the hall again. The only thing there was the chair. His spiritual sense probed the cave entrance but felt blocked, unable to penetrate.

Everyone fell into contemplation. Only soft breathing sounds filled the air.

“Everyone, let’s check for any mechanisms here,” Tian Luo sighed, his face also showing resignation.

Tian Luo was mysterious in the Southern Region. No one knew which sect he belonged to. Some said Tian Luo was a lone cultivator, but few could reach his level through mere cultivation alone. In truth, Tian Luo had no sect. Since he started cultivating, he often entered dangerous places to seek fortune. Otherwise, a lone cultivator could never reach his level. With years of experience, Tian Luo knew they were in grave danger.

Hearing Tian Luo’s words, the twelve people scattered to search for mechanisms. After about an hour of searching, they all returned with drooping heads.

Luo Tian’s gaze flickered. He looked at the black cave entrance, his face thoughtful as he addressed everyone: “What if we try this cave?”

“Mad! You’re mad. Don’t assume others are as crazy as you!” Shangguan Hongtu sneered at Luo Tian.

“It’s not impossible. Perhaps it is an exit. The cave guardian spirit’s actions might have been a deception, making us fear this entrance,” Tian Luo frowned slightly, prompting the group to think.

Shangguan Hongtu wore an awkward expression and said nothing. Waiting for the group’s decision.

“Enter or not?” Everyone wore solemn expressions. Entering might mean survival; not entering, if the cave guardian spirit gained time, they would surely die.

“Damn it! I’ll take my chances. Better to die than stay here!” Xu Lizi yi’s face showed a fierce determination. He punched the seemingly weak barrier of the cave entrance.

“Crack…” Under Xu Lizi yi’s furious punch, the barrier cracked. The black cave entrance appeared before Luo Tian and others.

“Go!” Xu Lizi yi strode forward toward the cave entrance. Another figure appeared before him.

“Go, together!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. He patted Xu Lizi yi’s shoulder and they both stepped into the cave entrance.

Leng Qiuchan wore a complex expression. Before entering, Luo Tian had told her to wait for him. She understood his meaning—that he didn’t want her to take risks.

“If you die, what’s the point of me living?” Leng Qiuchan sneered and stepped into the cave entrance.

“Haha! Go on, even a woman entered. What are we afraid of!” Tian Luo laughed and stepped into the cave entrance.

Seeing Tian Luo enter, others hesitated but finally stepped in after biting their teeth.

“Damn it!” In a grand hall, after Luo Tian and others entered the cave entrance, a cold voice echoed. A middle-aged man radiated powerful energy, his eyes filled with killing intent as he opened them.

“Still didn’t fall for it. But almost,” the middle-aged man growled, his movements slightly stiff.

“Go, my children. Block your enemies!” The middle-aged man spoke softly and waved his hand. Black mist escaped from his palm, entering the stone statues before him.

“Hum…” Twelve stone statues slowly opened their eyes. Their eyes glowed with dark light, and they moved toward the cave entrance.

“Nothing!” Luo Tian and Xu Lizi yi had just entered the cave entrance when they noticed it felt no more terrifying than outside. The cave was spacious and bright, with night pearls imbued with arrays emitting soft light.

Waves of energy spread. Leng Qiuchan and others like Xiu appeared in Luo Tian and Xu Lizi yi’s view.

“Haha, Luo Tian, I didn’t expect you to be right!” Tian Luo laughed and approached Luo Tian.

Others wore expressions of joy, greeting Luo Tian repeatedly.

“Enough. Our crisis isn’t resolved yet. Let’s hurry and leave!” Luo Tian sighed, no longer wasting words. He extended his spiritual sense through the bright cave entrance and flashed forward like a streak of light.

“Boom…” But just as Luo Tian and others flew out, a deep sound echoed in their ears. Luo Tian stopped.

“What is it?” The twelve people wore solemn expressions, gazing into the cave’s depths.

“Puppet!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed concern. His spiritual sense revealed twelve statues, each holding a long sword and radiating black mist before them.

“Hmph. A mere soul-fragment level stone puppet? How dare you block us?” Shangguan Hongtu sneered, punching forward.

“Boom…” The punch landed. Black mist spread. Twelve statues of soul-fragment initial level, towering and blocking the cave entrance, were shattered.

Chapter 664: Movement Art

“Boom boom…” The massive statues crumbled under Luo Tian’s group’s gaze, their deep sound echoing in the enclosed cave.

“Too simple!” Shangguan Hongtu smiled, addressing Xiu and others.

Others, including Luo Tian, wore expressions of confusion. The obstacles the cave guardian spirit had given them seemed too easy.

“Not so simple,” Luo Tian whispered, his words reaching Shangguan Hongtu’s ears.

“What do you mean it's not simple? It was straightforward!” Shangguan Hongtu’s face bore disdain. Though he no longer wanted to kill Luo Tian due to the Tian Shi Sect, he still couldn’t get over the grudge. Seeing an opportunity to undermine Luo Tian, he acted without hesitation.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed. Before Shangguan Hongtu’s words ended, the twelve statues slowly rose and merged back into their original state.

“Shangguan Hongtu, be careful!” Someone warned, seeing him turn his back to the group.

“Boom…” The front statue wielded a long sword, slicing down at Shangguan Hongtu with a thunderous sound.

Dust rose, engulfing Shangguan Hongtu and obscuring the view.

“Soul-fragment intermediate?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light, his thoughts deepening.

“Damn it!” Shangguan Hongtu retreated to the group. His face showed astonishment. Though soul-fragment intermediate was powerful, it still couldn’t harm Shangguan Hongtu significantly.

“Crack…” A heavy sound echoed again. The twelve statues advanced slowly toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Kill!” Shangguan Hongtu’s eyes showed disbelief, punching the twelve statues again.

“Stop!”
“Idiot!” Luo Tian and Tian Luo spoke simultaneously, but it was too late. Shangguan Hongtu’s fist carried immense intent, shattering the twelve statues.

“Damn it! Are you an idiot!” Xu Lizi yi cursed, his gaze toward Shangguan Hongtu filled with contempt.

Others looked at Shangguan Hongtu with changing expressions, as if viewing a fool. These statues clearly had something odd—though only soul-fragment level, they couldn’t harm them. Yet these statues were clearly not easily destroyed; they were immortal beings. Each death seemed to increase their strength.

As expected, the statues shattered by Shangguan Hongtu’s punch quickly reassembled and their aura surged, reaching soul-fragment initial level.

“Damn it! Shangguan Hongtu, what the hell were you thinking? You’re an idiot!” Xu Lizi yi cursed, his gaze toward Shangguan Hongtu.

Others’ gazes toward Shangguan Hongtu also turned hostile. Now that the statues had reached soul-fragment initial level, though still not a threat to them, they posed some danger.

Shangguan Hongtu was also stunned. He hadn’t expected his two punches of anger to elevate the statues’ strength to soul-fragment initial level. Seeing the hostile gazes around him, Shangguan Hongtu no longer dared to be arrogant and hid behind Xiu.

“This is a problem. Originally, if these statues were soul-fragment level, we could pass without damaging them,” Xu Lizi yi cursed, looking at Shangguan Hongtu.

Hearing Xu Lizi yi’s words, others sighed inwardly: “Fear a godlike opponent, but fear a pig-like teammate!” A simple task had been unnecessarily complicated by this fool.

“Fengtian Step!” Luo Tian roared, his body flashing like lightning toward the twelve statues. He relied on speed to pass through.

But soon, Luo Tian felt an ominous wind. The statues had reached soul-fragment level—obviously stronger than before. Though they couldn’t harm Luo Tian, they could find his flight path and block him. Plus, the statues’ massive bodies filled the cave, making Luo Tian’s movements more difficult.

Golden long swords left trails of afterimages, slicing at Luo Tian’s back. He dodged three statues but was struck by the fourth.

Luo Tian’s body was immensely strong. The sword strike on his body sent powerful rebound force, beyond what a soul-fragment initial level statue could withstand.

“Boom…” The fourth statue shattered into dust.

In an instant, even Luo Tian hadn’t reacted. The statues reassembled and their aura surged to soul-fragment late stage.

“Not good!” Luo Tian sighed, using Fengtian Step to narrowly dodge the first three statues’ attacks and return to the group.

“Failure?” Eleven people looked at Luo Tian, their faces filled with shock. Luo Tian’s strength was undeniable; among the group, only Tian Luo and Xiu were his equals. Yet he had failed—clearly a problem.

“Soul-fragment late stage!” Luo Han said, looking at the statue shattered by Luo Tian. His face bore concern.

“We can’t let these guys shatter again. Soul-fragment late stage is manageable, but if they break again and become soul-consolidation level, we’ll be in real danger!” Jin Wulong said, his face showing concern as the statues approached.

“Movement art!” Zhou Ziyang’s face showed bitterness. The situation was clearly not suitable for brute force; they had to rely on movement art to pass through. But Zhou Ziyang was the least skilled in it.

Zhou Ziyang’s words fell, and others wore expressions of bitterness. These people weren’t skilled in movement art.

“Useless. Even Luo Tian’s movement art is exquisite, but he couldn’t pass through. Others are even worse!” Chen Changsheng said softly, his face showing admiration.

“I’ll try,” Xiu said calmly. He vanished into thin air, as if dissolving into the void.

Chapter 665: Fengtian’s Seventh Step

Seeing Xiu vanish, Luo Tian and others wore hopeful expressions. Xiu’s assassination movement art was surely unmatched among the twelve. If even Xiu couldn’t pass through, there would be no hope.

“One… two…” Though Xiu’s aura vanished, the statues seemed to know his location. Their weapons smashed into the void, creating powerful waves.

Others couldn’t see Xiu’s form. Only Luo Tian and Tian Luo could detect his presence with their spiritual senses.

Luo Tian wore admiration. At this moment, Xiu was like a dancer on a knife’s edge, passing through one statue each time.

“Seven… eight…” Luo Tian whispered, his eyes flashing with light.

“Twelve!” The voices of Luo Tian and Tian Luo echoed together. In their spiritual senses, Xiu’s form appeared behind the last statue. His face remained calm.

“Success?” Xu Lizi yi and Zhou Ziyang wore expressions of surprise, looking at Luo Tian and Tian Luo.

“Alright, I’ll try,” Tian Luo smiled. His body flashed forward, his soul-consolidation initial level energy radiating as he vanished.

Tian Luo was a soul-consolidation initial-level powerhouse. Though the statues were at soul-fragment initial level, they couldn’t harm him. Yet he remained cautious, his face showing concern as he weaved through the twelve statues and appeared before Xiu. The group marveled again.

“Senior Tian Luo, Xiu, you two go first. If we can pass through, we’ll help you!” Jin Wulong addressed Tian Luo and Xiu. He didn’t want them to waste more time, as every moment wasted meant a threat to their lives.

Hearing Jin Wulong’s words, Tian Luo and Xiu exchanged glances. They knew they couldn’t help the group here. Their bodies flashed forward and vanished, flying toward the cave’s exit.

“I’ll try,” Shangguan Hongtu said confidently. Xiu had passed through, and he was a prodigy of the Yellow Spirit Sect. His movement art was similar to Xiu’s, so he had considerable confidence.

“Hum…” Spiritual energy waves rose under Shangguan Hongtu’s feet. His form vanished like Xiu’s, appearing before the first soul-fragment late stage statue.

“One… three…” In a moment, Shangguan Hongtu passed through three statues. Luo Tian was amazed.

“Chance?” Seeing the surprise in Luo Tian’s eyes, others also looked at the statues.

“Eight… boom…” When Luo Tian counted to eight, a smashing sound echoed in their ears. Their lips twitched slightly.

“Damn it!” Though Xu Lizi yi didn’t see Shangguan Hongtu’s form, he knew the sound meant something. He cursed again.

“Boom…” Before they could react, another deep sound echoed in their ears, darkening their faces.

In an instant, Shangguan Hongtu’s form returned. His face wore bitterness, his eyes avoiding others.

“You bastard! No talent but still show off!” Xu Lizi yi shouted, mocking. Others also sneered.

With two statues shattered, the difficulty of passing through increased. Shangguan Hongtu’s face felt embarrassed. His mind cursed: “Why is there such a gap between people, even with the same movement art!”

“I’ll try,” the silent cold autumn cicada (Leng Qiuchan) spoke. The group’s heavy atmosphere slightly eased.

Hearing Leng Qiuchan’s words, Luo Tian turned to look at the cold veil over her face. He nodded gently: “Be careful.”

“Hmph,” Leng Qiuchan remained cold as ever. She nodded slightly, her lips curling up. Her feet surged with wind and vanished.

“Fengtian’s Seventh Step!” A cold voice echoed in the cave, making Luo Tian frown slightly. But instantly, his eyes widened.

In his vision, Leng Qiuchan’s form seemed motionless. She stood before the first statue.
