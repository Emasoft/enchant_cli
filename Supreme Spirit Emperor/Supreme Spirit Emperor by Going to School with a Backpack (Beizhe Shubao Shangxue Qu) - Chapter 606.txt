Tai Bai strolled leisurely, occasionally humming a tune while sipping some wine, looking quite content.

"Senior, wait!" Luotian rushed forward three steps at a time and stood before Jiang Taibai. He loudly addressed Jiang Taibai, causing him to stop.

"What's the matter?" Jiang Taibai smiled slightly and looked at Luotian.

"Senior, you once met a person named Gu Tianshu and drank together. I would like to ask where you saw him, and whether there's any news about him now?" Luotian said, his voice filled with excitement.

"Gu Tianshu?" Upon hearing Luotian's words, Jiang Taibai's eyes showed understanding but he shook his head gently.

"You are not yet qualified to seek him out!" Jiang Taibai spoke softly, causing Luotian's heart to slightly tremble.

"Not qualified?" Luotian muttered under his breath, his eyes showing confusion. He was no longer the boy who had first come to the Immortal Realm, but now a True Immortal at his peak, capable of fighting half-step Immortal Kings. If he was not qualified, what would be?

"When you reach the level of an Immortal King, I will tell you!" Jiang Taibai said no more and disappeared from Luotian's sight.

"Grand Elder is in trouble!" After thinking for a while, Luotian's eyes slightly narrowed, forming a guess.

Gu Tianshu must have encountered some trouble. Otherwise, Jiang Taibai would not have kept it from him. Gu Tianshu was likely in danger, but not life-threatening.

"An Immortal King?" Luotian muttered to himself and did not continue questioning Jiang Taibai. He turned back towards the Hall of Punishment.

The next day, a piece of news spread like a storm throughout Mount Btian. It was that the Deputy Hall Master of the First Peak, Jiang Kang, had been removed from his post. The new Hall Master was named Zhang Ziping.

"Deputy Hall Master, why has he been replaced? Well, it's better this way. That Jiang Kang was no good, using his family connections to act arrogantly!"

"Who is this Zhang Ziping? He was previously unknown, but now he has become Deputy Hall Master!" The entire Mount Btian started to discuss. Everyone knew that Jiang Taibai loved to wander around, and the affairs of the Hall of Punishment were usually entirely entrusted to the Deputy Hall Master.

The most excited were the disciples and elders of the Hall of Punishment. Most of them had been soldiers who had left the city of Btian or were disciples of Mount Btian. They were all quite straightforward and could not tolerate Jiang Kang's previous behavior.

However, soon the eighteen peaks of Mount Btian started to feel self-conscious and strictly controlled their disciples. A new official's first three fires are always burning, so if it burned onto one's peak, that would be quite embarrassing.

But to everyone's surprise, Zhang Ziping did indeed burn the fire, and it burned all eighteen peaks.

On the Second Peak of Mount Btian, a young man with an air of confidence walked along the mountain path. His name was Wang Menqing, and his cultivation level was not high, only at the middle stage of True Immortal. He was quite insignificant on Mount Btian.

As he walked, nine figures appeared before Wang Menqing. The cold atmosphere made Wang Menqing's face pale.

"Jing... Hall Master..." Wang Menqing looked at the long robe the person was wearing and almost wet himself. He quickly bowed to show respect.

"Are you Wang Menqing?" The leader behind the young man carried a large sword, and it was Luotian. Behind him were the Eight Ghost Guards.

"Yes, what are your instructions, Hall Master?" Wang Menqing quickly showed a fawning smile and addressed Luotian.

"Thirty years ago, in the Central Three Heavens, the Wang family of Wutian City. There were six hundred and thirty people in total?" Luotian spoke coldly, his demonic energy could scare anyone. Combined with the dead faces of the Eight Ghost Guards, Wang Menqing immediately fell to the ground.

Chapter 2292: The Dan()

"Ahh..." Upon hearing Luotian's words, Wang Menqing's face turned pale. This was the biggest secret in Wang Menqing's heart. He had once entered the Central Three Heavens to find a suitable treasure for his cultivation. In the end, he had innocently killed the entire family of the city's lord and even raped the lord's daughter.

At that time, Wang Menqing was very nervous when he returned to Btian City. His actions had affected the rules of Mount Btian, and if Mount Btian found out, he would definitely be dead. Wang Menqing was desperate because it had indeed been discovered by Btian City. Mount Btian had a place called the Hall of Secrets, which managed all kinds of information.

At that time, Wang Menqing took a gamble and approached the Deputy Hall Master of the Enforcement Hall, Jiang Kang. He was happy to find that Jiang Kang had accepted his gifts and punished him, but the punishment was very light.

Wang Menqing never expected that after so many years, the Enforcement Hall had discovered it again and directly came to him.

"Master... Master, I am innocent!" Wang Menqing shouted with despair in his voice. However, two cold sickles were placed on his neck, and the two big hands of Guiyi and Guier firmly grabbed Wang Menqing and subdued him.

"Silence him! Find the next one!" Luotian took a step forward and took out a list. He crossed off Wang Menqing's name. This was the fifth person Luotian had caught.

The cleansing began, and everyone in Mount Btian was on edge, fearing that the Enforcement Hall would come for them. After all, as cultivators, who didn't have their own secrets?

The Enforcement Hall had over a million people, and almost all of them were mobilized to scour Mount Btian. People who had previously escaped punishment under Jiang Kang were caught by the disciples and elders of the Enforcement Hall.

"This Deputy Hall Master is quite good!" The peak masters also received news and knew Zhang Ziping's intention.

It had been seven days. For the people of Mount Btian, it felt like years, as if they were in hell, fearing that the Enforcement Hall would come for them.

After seven days, Luotian and others had finally caught almost everyone on the list left by Jiang Taibai. The situation then calmed down.

"It's finally over..." Everyone secretly sighed in relief, and Mount Btian returned to normal.

"However, the Enforcement Hall hasn't made such a big move for a long time. It's good to remind us that the Enforcement Hall still exists!" The disciples of Mount Btian all sighed.

...

While everyone was discussing the Enforcement Hall, in the hall of the Enforcement Hall, Zhang Ziping sat at the head. Beside him stood Lei Yong and Ji Chen. Xiong Qianshan and others sat on chairs, and Luotian was among them.

Some of these people were old members under Jiang Kang. They had all been taken over by Zhang Ziping, and for those with more serious issues, Zhang Ziping had punished them according to the rules of Mount Btian.

"Deputy Hall Master, now that our Enforcement Hall's reputation has recovered a bit, but the disciples believe you are just burning for three fires at the beginning, and after some time it will go out!" Xiong Qianshan smiled and addressed Zhang Ziping.

"This is not something that can be done in a day. Next, we need to clean up the Enforcement Hall!" Zhang Ziping spoke softly.

"Also, some people who are not in Mount Btian, send someone to bring them back!" Zhang Ziping naturally took over the position of Deputy Hall Master and handled everything in an orderly manner.

"Senior Brother, I'll go. I'll bring back those people!" Luotian's face showed eagerness and addressed Zhang Ziping. Luotian was not someone who could sit idle; it wasn't very meaningful to stay in the Enforcement Hall.

"Think you're lucky, just sit here and be quiet!" However, Zhang Ziping immediately rejected Luotian's suggestion. This made Luotian feel a bit helpless and sit down.

But soon, Luotian understood. Zhang Ziping had just taken over the position of Deputy Hall Master and hadn't yet solidified his seat. If he stayed, it would help Zhang Ziping a lot.

Moreover, Zhang Ziping was also worried that Luotian might cause trouble outside. After all, this was the Upper Three Heavens, and Luotian, a True Immortal at his peak, although he had strength, it was still possible to encounter danger.

"Ah..." Luotian sighed long and sat down, following Zhang Ziping's arrangements.

It had been half an hour. Finally, Zhang Ziping stopped and looked at the people in the hall: "Alright, do as I said!"

"Yes..." Xiong Qianshan and others showed admiration towards Zhang Ziping. They were all rough people, but they hadn't expected that Zhang Ziping could arrange everything in order and assign tasks clearly right after taking the position. Even Luotian was assigned a task, leaving him speechless. That task was to cultivate elixirs.

"Alright, it's been a long time since I came to Mount Btian. Not seeing the elixirs and formulas of Mount Btian would be a shame. Also, I haven't used the elixir art for a long time; my hands have become rusty. Moreover, those magic seeds drawn from the Heart of the World can't be directly consumed but could be neutralized by being made into elixirs, perhaps allowing me to consume them."

"Also, I need to arrange for Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue!" Luotian thought to himself, his eyes showing a smile.

Luotian took steps towards the Elixir Peak of Mount Btian. Although elixir masters were rare in the Immortal Realm, they were still respected. Mount Btian, as one of the Nine Immortal Mountains, placed great importance on elixir art. Therefore, a mountain peak was named the Elixir Peak. The elixir masters lived on this peak and it was open to all disciples and elders of Mount Btian.

Luotian walked slowly, with the Eight Ghost Guards following behind him. Their aura was strong and the disciples of the Enforcement Hall showed respect.

In just seven days, Luotian had gained a certain status within the Enforcement Hall and was fully established as an elder. He became the youngest inner disciple elder of Mount Btian.

Soon, Luotian and his nine people left the Enforcement Hall and headed towards the Eighth Peak. Walking along the path to the Eighth Peak, no one dared to provoke them because Luotian and his nine people were wearing Enforcement Hall robes. The blood-red long robes carried a cold aura, and over these days, Luotian had captured many people, making the disciples of Mount Btian fully recognize him.

After walking for half an hour, Luotian arrived at the Eighth Peak. Upon ascending the Eighth Peak, a strong essence of plants and trees enveloped him, making Luotian take a long breath.

"Indeed, Mount Btian!" Luotian sighed long and deeply. The essence of plants and trees on the Eighth Peak was truly something he had rarely seen since coming to the Immortal Realm.

The Eighth Peak was bustling with people. Disciples were walking around, visiting their elixir masters. Upon seeing Luotian, they were slightly surprised.

"Enforcement Hall, Elder Luo!"

"Would Elder Luo dare to move against the Eighth Peak?" Some disciples whispered among themselves. Some were even bold enough to follow Luotian towards the top of the Elixir Peak.

Luotian didn't care about people following him and walked slowly. After an hour, he finally arrived at the Elixir Hall of the Elixir Peak and stepped inside.

Upon entering the main gate, Luotian saw people coming and going. The hall was filled with noise, but as soon as Luotian entered, the hall became quiet. Everyone looked at Luotian and his group.

"Enforcement Hall, Luo Tian! You've captured hundreds of people these days. Are you coming to the Eighth Peak to capture more?" People didn't dare to speak, looking at Luotian. This made Luotian feel a bit awkward.

"Elder Luo, what's the matter with your visit to our Eighth Peak?" A middle-aged man smiled and walked out from the inner hall. His attire indicated he was an elder with some status.

"I would like to watch our Eighth Peak's elixir formulas. What procedures are required?" Luotian responded, and the hall immediately became chaotic with people gasping.

"Ha ha, Elder Luo, you have the authority to watch all elixir formulas below the seventh grade. I'll go and handle it for you!" The middle-aged man's heart was relieved, and he personally led Luotian into the inner part of the Elixir Hall.

In a quiet courtyard, an old man sat at the entrance of a large hall. His body leaned against the door, and he was yawning.

Around the old man were young disciples standing respectfully, waiting for him to speak.

"Good, are you all here? Today I'll talk about the fourth-grade elixir, the Soul-Soothing Elixir. You should all know about this formula. The Soul-Soothing Elixir is simple but not simple, and difficult but not difficult. However, elixir art is ever-changing; sometimes adding a few more herbs can turn one elixir into another!"

"Today, I'll teach you about the Soul-Soothing Elixir and which herbs can be added to turn it into other elixirs!" The old man looked at nearly a hundred young disciples and spoke softly, his eyes showing great pride.

"Indeed, Elder Jiang is capable of creating elixir formulas!" As the old man's words ended, praises arose, making him very pleased.

At that moment, the middle-aged man led Luotian and his group over. He stood outside the crowd and whispered to Luotian: "Sorry, Elder Jiang is giving a lecture on elixirs. Please wait for Elder Jiang to finish his lecture, and I'll inform him. Elder Jiang doesn't like being disturbed during his elixir lectures." The middle-aged man's face showed apology.

"No problem," Luotian nodded and didn't pay much attention. He watched the old man begin to speak, his eyes showing interest.

However, after listening carefully, Luotian didn't find much interest. The old man's teachings were useful for elixir masters below the third grade, but not for Luotian. He had previously tried to add other herbs to elixir formulas and create new ones. This kind of thing could be deduced if one understood the herbs, as all variations were based on a common principle.

However, Luotian and his group's appearance caught the attention of many disciples. After all, their blood aura was heavy these days, and their blood-red Enforcement Hall robes were very eye-catching.

Soon, the disciples listening to the lecture felt uncomfortable. Their eyes occasionally looked towards Luotian's group, fearing that he might suddenly capture people.

"You guys came for what?" The old man noticed something was wrong and saw Luotian and his group at the back of the crowd. His eyes flashed with anger, and he shouted loudly.

Chapter 2293: The Invisible Confrontation()

The old man's loud shout made the courtyard quiet. Everyone's eyes turned to Luotian, and they showed admiration.

"Indeed, Elder Jiang dares to scold an Enforcement Hall elder!" The disciples whispered among themselves, making Elder Jiang's pride even stronger.

Jiang An, the Eighth Peak elder and a sixth-grade elixir master. His elixir cultivation was among the middle to upper ranks of the Eighth Peak. However, his background was the Jiang family. Luotian's mind generated the old man's information; Enforcement Hall people naturally needed to know a lot of intelligence.

Luotian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, but he didn't retaliate. The elixir masters were proud, and his presence here indeed disrupted Elder Jiang's lecture.

However, Luotian furrowed his eyebrows. The Eight Ghost Guards emitted a cold aura and stared at Elder Jiang with icy eyes.

The cold atmosphere made the disciples feel a chill, and they instinctively moved away from Luotian.

"Elder Jiang, the Enforcement Hall inner disciple elder Luo Tian wants to view elixir formulas. Please open the Elixir Hall!" The middle-aged man smiled and addressed Elder Jiang.

"What?" Upon hearing the middle-aged man's words, Elder Jiang's face slightly changed and showed displeasure.

"The Enforcement Hall people only deal with killing. What are they doing with elixirs? It's a waste. Go back, don't disturb me while I'm giving my lecture!" Elder Jiang sneered and spoke coldly. His eyes looked at Luotian with disdain, showing the pride of an elixir master.

"Chen Feng, next time if Enforcement Hall people come here, just let them wait in the outer courtyard. Don't bring them into the inner courtyard!" Elder Jiang spoke again, showing no respect for Luotian, even though he was currently popular. After all, he was an elixir master with a high status in Mount Btian.

"Do I have the right to view elixir formulas? It's not said that the Eighth Peak is open to all disciples and elders?" Luotian spoke softly, a slight anger rising in his heart.

"Indeed, this rule was set by the Eighth Peak. We can also change it!" Elder Jiang saw Luotian dared to counter, and he spoke again with a shout.

"Killing hands are not fit for elixirs. Go away! If you want to investigate me, go ahead and do it. But my Eighth Peak's elixir masters are united; you should consider the consequences and don't affect our relationship!" Elder Jiang sneered, looking confident.

"Can you represent the Eighth Peak? If you can't, sorry, good dogs don't block the way!" Luotian's eyes turned icy and stared at Elder Jiang, finally exploding.

One glance fell upon him, causing Elder Jiang's body to slightly tremble. It felt as if he had been struck by an endless darkness and a thunderbolt, the powerful pressure making Elder Jiang's face break out in cold sweat.

Luotian took a step forward and slowly walked towards Elder Jiang. His eyes remained fixed on him, making Elder Jiang unable to move, as if his body was gripped by an invisible hand.

"Boom..." With each step Luotian took, Elder Jiang spat out a thread of blood. His heart beat in sync with Luotian's steps.

Several tens of feet, Luotian walked slowly. It took a hundred breaths before he reached Elder Jiang's side. Behind him, the Eight Ghost Guards followed, and eight people looked like a sword drawn from its sheath. Their aura was menacing.

"I don't suggest you investigate the Eighth Peak and find out how many dirty things there are!" Luotian spoke, causing Elder Jiang to regain his freedom. At the same time, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Did you dare to threaten me? Do you know who I am?" Elder Jiang spoke, his voice filled with anger. He looked fearless.

"I won't accept any elixirs from the Enforcement Hall!"

"Not only will I not accept them, but none of the elixir masters from the Eighth Peak will accept Enforcement Hall elixirs!" Elder Jiang spoke, his voice cold. He wiped the blood from his mouth and showed mockery in his eyes.

"Uh..." Elder Jiang's words made Luotian stunned. A smile appeared on his lips, surprised that he had been threatened by someone else for once. This was something he used to threaten others.

However, Luotian's momentary hesitation made Elder Jiang believe that Luotian was afraid. His eyes showed confidence and he spoke to Luotian: "Now, apologize and offer your respects. I might still allow you to have the right to view elixir formulas on behalf of the Enforcement Hall!"

"Good, good, good!"

"Don't accept them then. Of course, don't regret it!" Luotian laughed softly and didn't take Elder Jiang's threat seriously. Instead, he took out a token.

"Enforcement Hall disciple of the First Peak. From today on, I will thoroughly investigate the Eighth Peak. Any disciples entering the Eighth Peak must be investigated by me. I want to see how many people dare to seek out your Eighth Peak's elixir masters!" Luotian spoke coldly.

"..." The disciples who had been listening to Elder Jiang's lecture were stunned. They hadn't expected that Luotian and Elder Jiang had clashed so directly.

"Yes!" The Enforcement Hall disciples immediately received Luotian's command and quickly obeyed. Blood-red figures emerged from the First Peak, while Enforcement Hall intelligence began to compile information on the Eighth Peak.

"You..." Elder Jiang's face was also difficult, not expecting Luotian to be fearless and even thoroughly investigate the Eighth Peak. He had also investigated those who came to the Eighth Peak for elixirs.

"You, an Enforcement Hall elder, have no right to mobilize all Enforcement Hall disciples. Don't scare me!" Elder Jiang sneered, his eyes filled with contempt.

In the Enforcement Hall's grand hall, Zhang Ziping sat there, his eyes showing contemplation.

"Go ahead and investigate!" Zhang Ziping also received the news that Luotian would thoroughly investigate the Eighth Peak. His eyebrows slightly furrowed, then he spoke softly.

"Deputy Hall Master, the Eighth Peak is entirely composed of elixir masters. We are clearly going to provoke a wasp's nest. Is this really...?"熊 Qianshan and others also received the news and came to Zhang Ziping.

"It's fine. Elixir masters are just that, they might be valuable elsewhere, but to my younger brother, they're worthless. Because that kid is also an elixir master..." Zhang Ziping smiled softly, secretly sighing about whether it was a mistake to keep Luotian by his side.

"Yes!"熊 Qianshan and others saw Zhang Ziping say this, but they were still worried. The importance of elixir masters was something even they valued greatly. Zhang Ziping's actions clearly meant to clash with the Eighth Peak, and the outcome was uncertain.

As Zhang Ziping's command was issued, each Enforcement Hall disciple put aside their current tasks and started to act. At the same time, the elixir masters of the Eighth Peak also received Elder Jiang's transmission. Although some were confused, they followed instructions due to their unity.

The disciples in the courtyard watched in amazement as Luotian and Elder Jiang clashed over a small matter.

"Elixir masters must not be insulted. From now on, the Enforcement Hall's elixirs will not be accepted by our Eighth Peak!" As people were speechless, a deep voice echoed from the Eighth Peak. This marked the beginning of an invisible war between the two peaks, a battle without physical combat but concerning their prestige and status.

"Let's go!" Luotian spoke softly, knowing he wouldn't be able to view the elixir formulas. He turned and walked out of the inner courtyard, heading back towards the First Peak to his residence.

"I really want to see what you're capable of!" Elder Jiang's face was dark, and since the peak master had spoken, his confidence increased.

"Uncle Jiang, we'll leave now. We'll come back another day to listen to your elixir lecture!" As Elder Jiang's words ended, the disciples who had been listening to his lecture immediately spoke. They had just heard that not only would they investigate the elixir masters of the Eighth Peak, but also those who came to seek elixirs from them. They didn't want to get involved in the conflict between the two peaks.

As Luotian left, Enforcement Hall disciples quickly arrived. In an instant, the Enforcement Hall had discovered many problematic Eighth Peak disciples and elders, starting to take them out.

"Really capturing people!" The Enforcement Hall's actions immediately caused a stir, even other peaks paid attention to the developments.

One side was Mount Btian's Enforcement Hall, the enforcers of Mount Btian. The other side was the respected elixir masters of Mount Btian. If they truly clashed, who would win was uncertain.

Moreover, the Enforcement Hall had many disciples stationed at the base of the Eighth Peak. Anyone who wanted to seek elixirs from the elixir masters would have their names recorded and sent back to the Enforcement Hall for investigation.

In a short time, people were in chaos. Soon, few dared to come to the Eighth Peak to seek elixirs from the Eighth Peak's elixir masters. Only a few people who were particularly desperate or confident, and those who needed resources without fear of being investigated, dared to come to the Eighth Peak.

Time passed. A month had gone by. This month was a heavy loss for the Eighth Peak, as few people came to seek elixirs from the elixir masters. The elixir masters had no income and started to rely on their savings.

"The Enforcement Hall has the upper hand!" The disciples of Mount Btian discussed, always watching the conflict between the two peaks.

However, there were those who understood it was just the beginning. If time went on, the Enforcement Hall would also be unable to endure because cultivation required elixirs. The Enforcement Hall disciples were no exception.

Chapter 2294: The Arrival of the Xuan Elixir()

In the Enforcement Hall's grand hall, the high-ranking officials sat there. Zhang Ziping was at the head. The atmosphere in the hall was somewhat heavy, and everyone's faces were serious.

"Master, it has been a month. Although no one has spoken out, this situation can't continue forever. If it lasts longer, the disciples will definitely be unable to endure!" An old man spoke, his voice filled with anger.

"Yes, we are already making plans. Things have come to this point. To get those elixir masters to make elixirs again, we will definitely have to pay a heavy price!"

"Now it's just about who can endure longer. Whoever endures first will lose, so everyone must hold on!" Zhang Ziping spoke. He didn't know what Luotian was up to, but based on his understanding of Luotian, he knew that Luotian wouldn't have started a war with the Eighth Peak without a plan.

A month had passed. The Enforcement Hall was also gradually struggling, with many disciples running out of elixirs and no one to make them. They didn't know where to get elixirs.

However, most of the Enforcement Hall's disciples were former soldiers from Btian City. They instinctively followed orders and didn't have much complaint.

Compared to the Enforcement Hall, the Eighth Peak was also struggling. The elixir masters had no one coming to seek their services, like having their livelihood taken away.

"Report to the Young Master and also inform all disciples of the sect. There will definitely be complaints, which need to be mobilized. I don't believe the Enforcement Hall can cover everything!" An old man sat in the Eighth Peak's grand hall, his face showing a smile as he spoke to those under him. This man was the Deputy Hall Master of the Eighth Peak, Lin Yuhan.

Lin Yuhan had a cultivation level of half-step Immortal King but was an eighth-grade elixir master. The Eighth Peak and the Enforcement Hall were similar, with the hall master often absent and unpredictable, leaving the Deputy Hall Master in charge.

"Yes!" An old man responded with a bow and left the hall to issue instructions.

"Jiang An, this whole thing started because of you. Does your family, Jiang, have no response?" Lin Yuhan looked at Jiang An with a hint of anger.

"Subordinates have already informed the head of the Jiang family about this matter. The head has promised to provide resources for the Eighth Peak for a month!" Jiang An spoke, his voice filled with respect.

Overall, Jiang An dared to act this way because of the support from the Jiang family. Luotian and Zhang Ziping had removed Jiang Kang, which was a big loss for the Jiang family. A half-step Immortal King and also the Deputy Hall Master, being dealt with like this was a big loss for the Jiang family. Moreover, it had been the first time anyone dared to challenge the Jiang family in such a way.

Therefore, the head of the Jiang family personally ordered to find trouble with Luotian and Zhang Ziping. Whoever could get rid of them would be a great achievement.

In a grand hall, four young men sat there. A banquet was set before the four of them. These young men were Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, Jiang Yuwen, and Jiang Yutian.

Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yufeng had failed to win the Young Master position but hadn't given up. Their elders also hadn't given up. Jiang Yutian, on the other hand, was full of resentment. Originally, he hadn't cared about the Young Master position, but in the Immortal Ruins, his dignity had been trampled. He couldn't swallow that humiliation.

Luotian became a thorn in the eyes of these four. And Luotian was also a sword for Jiang Yze. If they could get rid of Luotian, it would be like cutting off one of Jiang Yze's arms. Therefore, these four naturally wanted to get rid of Luotian.

"Nothing is happening at the Eighth Peak. As for the Enforcement Hall, it's currently difficult. Now it's just about who can endure longer. So we should try to help the Eighth Peak as much as possible!" Jiang Yuwen spoke softly, planning a cunning scheme. If the Enforcement Hall couldn't endure, he would have a way to get rid of Zhang Ziping and Luotian.

"Good. Let's go visit the Eighth Peak. Even if it means dying, we must make those elixir masters endure!" Jiang Yulong stood up and smiled as he left the hall.

"Luotian, so many people don't want you to have it easy. I wonder how you'll get through this challenge!" Jiang Yutian smiled coldly and headed towards the Eighth Peak.

Time passed. Another half-month had gone by. The Enforcement Hall's disciples were finally beginning to struggle, and some voices arose, but they still held on. After all, it was just a little slower in cultivation and healing.

The situation at the Eighth Peak wasn't good either. Although they had support from the Jiang family and four young men, they could still endure. However, elixir masters were originally in the business of making elixirs. Now no one was coming to seek their services, and they weren't comfortable either.

Luotian hadn't gone anywhere else these days. He had stayed in the Enforcement Hall, gradually causing the disciples to look down on him. Although they didn't say it openly, they whispered among themselves that if it wasn't for Luotian's impulsive actions, things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

Not only that, but the disciples of Mount Btian also started to rebel. It seemed like someone had organized them, and they formed groups going to the elders' quarters to complain.

However, the elders didn't say anything. Both sides were key figures in Mount Btian and it was hard to take a side.

Almost everyone was watching the conflict between the two peaks, waiting for who would win in the end.

Time passed again. Another month had gone by. Complaints became more severe, and even the Enforcement Hall itself started to have complaints. Some disciples began to complain to their leaders, hoping they would persuade Zhang Ziping and the Eighth Peak to stop fighting.

The situation at the Eighth Peak was similar. However, with support from the Jiang family and four young men, they couldn't negotiate peace. Both peaks seemed to be pushed to their limits but neither could admit defeat.

"Master, the brothers are really unable to endure. My brothers' injuries can't be sustained without elixirs!" An elder stood in the Enforcement Hall's grand hall and addressed Zhang Ziping.

"Yes, Master, we really can't do this anymore!" Others also echoed, as the Enforcement Hall was indeed struggling.

"Luotian, since this started because of you, go and apologize. Maybe the Eighth Peak will give us the Enforcement Hall some face. Then we can find an excuse to let both peaks save face and end this matter!" An old man looked at Luotian, who was frowning, and spoke loudly, bringing him back to his senses.

"Master Liu, please calm down. It's almost over. I think it will be resolved in a few days!" Luotian spoke softly, comforting the people.

"Words, half a month ago you said the same thing. What happened? After these half-months, there's still no solution!" The old man couldn't help but speak out, his eyes burning with anger.

"I don't care. My brother's life is important. Today either you solve the problem or apologize, I can't wait!" The old man looked like a scoundrel and refused to move.

"Alas... If it's unavoidable, I'll have to start making elixirs. But it will be exhausting. It can only treat the symptoms, not the root cause," Luotian thought to himself, watching the elders arguing and pointing fingers at him. He couldn't let Zhang Ziping be too troubled.

"Master, if you kneel before my Eighth Peak for three days and nights, we can forgive everything!" Just as the elders of the Enforcement Hall were arguing, a loud shout echoed from outside the mountain gate of the Enforcement Hall. This made everyone in the grand hall stop.

"Kneel your grandfather, what are you? We would rather starve than bow to you. What are you? If you had knelt and apologized, we might have forgiven you. We've already decided to fight with you!" The old man who had previously asked Luotian to apologize, upon hearing this voice, immediately cursed.

"Yes! It's just not eating that rotten elixir. It's not essential!" Other elders also spoke, as if they had changed their minds. Their attitude was very firm, making Luotian feel a bit amused but also warm inside.

They had only asked him to apologize, but when the Eighth Peak demanded Luotian to kneel, these people started defending themselves. Their meaning was clear: an apology would be enough and there wouldn't be any real loss, but to actually bow down and show submission was impossible.

"Master, Jiang Huantian has sent a message. He wants you to go to the main peak's Young Master Jiang Yze!" Just as Luotian was watching the elders argue, Guiyi walked in from outside the hall and addressed Luotian.

"Has he come?" Upon hearing Guiyi's words, Luotian straightened his body and showed a look of joy.

"Everyone, the problem can be solved. I'll go out for a while and give you all a surprise when I return!" Luotian laughed loudly, flew out of the hall and headed towards the main peak.

"What?" Upon hearing Luotian's words, people were slightly stunned. They hadn't expected that Luotian actually had a solution.

"Wait and see!" Zhang Ziping smiled slightly. He knew that if Luotian said he had a solution, then he did.

An hour later, Luotian appeared at the residence of Jiang Yze on the main peak. However, there were quite a few people standing outside the courtyard, showing some tension.

"Master Dao!" As soon as Luotian appeared, their faces showed respect.

"Haha, everyone, it's been a while!" Luotian's eyes showed joy. He greeted the people and stepped into the grand hall.

Pushing open the door, in the grand hall sat an old man and a young one. They were talking and laughing. The young one was Jiang Yze, while the old man had white hair, wore a long robe, and had an out-of-this-world aura. His face showed a gentle smile.

"Little Tian has come!" The old man smiled slightly and looked at Luotian with joy, addressing him.

"Luotian, I've brought people for you and arranged everything. The rest is up to you!" Jiang Yze smiled softly, then bowed to the old man: "Master Xuan Dan, I've prepared a banquet. Let's eat and talk!"

"Don't eat. My place is almost on fire, so we'll go now!" Luotian didn't care about that and grabbed Master Xuan Dan, walking out of the grand hall.

Chapter 2295: The Fire()

Luotian pulled Master Xuan Dan out of Jiang Yze's grand hall. As soon as he stepped outside, he saw hundreds of disciples and elders standing there, their faces showing a slight smile.

Luotian had contacted Jiang Yze earlier and asked him to bring the Xuan Dan of Shenglong Sect and the disciples who could make elixirs from Shenglong Sect to Mount Btian. Jiang Yze naturally did it, and Luotian was representing him. The high-ranking officials of Mount Btian also let Jiang Yze handle this matter, and Jiang Yze wanted to resolve it quickly.
