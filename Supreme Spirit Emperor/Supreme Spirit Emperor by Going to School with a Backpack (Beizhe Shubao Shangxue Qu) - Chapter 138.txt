“Hmph, I shall see how long you can endure,” the black-cloaked youth sneered, his face alight with triumph as he sat amidst the blood qi, awaiting Jiang Nanxuan’s array to weaken.

A day passed in the blink of an eye, and within the array, Gu Qianxue and others felt Jiang Nanxuan’s formation had weakened considerably from its initial strength, casting a shadow over their hearts.

“One day… two days…” Time drifted slowly; under the collective gaze of all, Jiang Nanxuan’s array had visibly deteriorated from three days prior. Now, the vibrant bodies of the poison insects were even visible beyond the array’s perimeter.

“Hahahaha!” A raucous laugh echoed as a dozen black-cloaked youths laughed, retrieving their insects with scornful faces, gazing at Jiang Nanxuan’s group within the array.

“Buzz…” The insects hummed again, returning to the youths’ bodies.

As the insects dispersed, Jiang Nanxuan’s array barrier revealed itself to the youths’ eyes. The formation was riddled with holes, almost transparent, its surface marred by countless depressions as if on the verge of shattering.

“Killing Life Array! Open!” The youth’s face bore a smile as the crimson dragon, absent for three days, coalesced again, surging forward with boundless blood qi.

Jiang Nanxuan turned his head toward Luotian’s direction, seeing the twelve individuals still unawakened. He gave a slight shake of his head.

“Alas…” Jiang Nanxuan sighed softly, releasing his previous life’s physical body from his storage pouch, a smile playing on his lips.

“Yaoyue, rest assured; I shall not forget you!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his gaze upon Meng Yao.

“Mm…” Meng Yao’s face remained calm as water, understanding what Jiang Nanxuan intended next. She nodded gently, her eyes filled with tenderness toward him.

“Come forth; I wish to see what form I shall take upon fusing my body!” Jiang Nanxuan’s usually serene gaze bore a rare edge of killing intent as he stared at the dozen youths outside the array.

At Jiang Nanxuan’s gaze, the youths instinctively shivered, a wave of perilous foreboding rising within them.

“Charge…”

The youths extended their hands, the crimson dragon surging forward with immense power, writhing through boundless blood qi toward the array.

“Fusion…” Jiang Nanxuan’s gray soul slowly emerged from his body, heading toward the World-Transcending Body.

“Depart!” Yet as Jiang Nanxuan neared the World-Transcending Body, a cold voice echoed before them, causing his soul to pause momentarily. His gray face, like solidified essence, bore a flicker of delight.

Beyond the array, the crimson dragon, on the cusp of striking, shattered with a thunderous roar, dissolving back into swirling blood qi.

Two eyes like lightning slowly opened, their gaze cold with killing intent toward the eleven youths outside the array.

“Awakened!” Jiang Nanxuan’s soul returned to his body, a smile returning as he gazed at Luotian.

“Luotian!” Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue’s voices rang out in surprise, their faces alight with joy as they beheld Luotian rising.

“Awakened?” The youths outside the array furrowed their brows, recognizing Luotian’s name. None in the Western Regions’ Heaven-Corpse Sect were unaware of Luotian, for he was the very target they sought to capture. Their purpose in entering the Xiangu Ruins had been solely to seize Luotian.

These eleven youths, having clashed with the Heaven-Corpse Sect before, harbored an inexplicable trepidation. The sect’s young master, Yang Huanyu, had nearly met his end at Luotian’s hands on multiple occasions.

Luotian rose slowly, a resounding rumble echoing from his body as he gazed at Jiang Nanxuan: “Nanxuan, you’ve endured much. Let me take over from here!”

Chapter 676: Eleven Simultaneously Converging Souls

Luotian rose, his gaze fixed on the dozen black-cloaked youths outside the array and the disheveled Gu Qianxue. A torrent of boundless killing intent radiated from him.

He soared into the sky, a seven-colored streak of light. Jiang Nanxuan’s array crumbled under his assault, collapsing irreparably.

“Hahahaha!” Xu Liyi opened his eyes, a hint of arrogance on his face as he leapt forward to stand before Luotian.

At the same time, others opened their eyes, their gazes sharp with brilliance as they rose from the array, standing atop the sky.

Twelve figures radiated immense power, like twelve mountains pressing down with overwhelming pressure.

“Die!” The boundless blood qi surged as the dozen black-cloaked youths, sensing the formidable aura of Luotian’s group, turned their Killing Life Array’s blood qi toward them instead of Jiang Nanxuan’s party.

“Depart!” Luotian sneered, a verdant flame erupting skyward, instantly enveloping the crimson dragon. The heavens filled with smoke and mist.

A smile graced Luotian’s face as he extended his hand, drawing the world’s qi toward him.

Xu Liyi and Leng Qiuchan among others also bore mocking expressions, their bodies emitting a suctioning force as they began absorbing the world’s qi.

Twelve swirling vortices of qi appeared, leaving onlookers awestruck.

Seeing Luotian’s group regain their strength, Jiang Nanxuan smiled. Having rested for three days, he had recovered sufficiently. He waved his hand, and eight hundred and ten array flags flew forth, encircling them once more. A golden barrier reappeared above their heads.

“Conceal…” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, his voice returning to its calm demeanor. As he finished speaking, the golden barrier vanished, revealing the outside world.

As Jiang Nanxuan completed his array, Luotian’s group had also absorbed the world’s qi. Their bodies emitted a thunderous rumble, and the sky darkened with storm clouds.

“They’re about to face a tribulation!” The black-cloaked youths’ faces shifted, their gazes fixed on Luotian’s group.

“Dodge!” The youths’ faces bore a hint of apprehension, their bodies darting two leagues away.

“Are they fools?” A Western Region genius sneered, gazing at the twelve figures in the sky.

Gu Qianxue and others within the barrier also wore puzzled expressions, unsure why Luotian’s group chose to face tribulation simultaneously.

“You all face it first; I’ll go play with those few,” Tian Luo smiled, addressing Luotian’s group.

Tian Luo was a World-Transcending Realm powerhouse, his cultivation having risen considerably through the Twelve Emperor Inheritances. Though he hadn’t reached World-Transcending Peak, his current status was World-Transcending Late Stage.

“I’ll assist you!” Meng Yao, seeing no danger to Jiang Nanxuan’s group, bore a fierce glint in her eyes. She exited the invisible barrier and flew toward the black-cloaked youths two leagues away with Tian Luo.

“I’ll go too! I’ll go too!” Chen Zhanbiao and Gu Lei eagerly volunteered, their frustration evident after days of restraint.

Though Tian Luo and Meng Yao were formidable, capturing these dozen World-Transcending Early Stage geniuses proved challenging.

Suddenly, streaks of light shot forth from the barrier, but this time, they were not the previous group. These were top-tier talents from three regions—those at the peak of the Soul-Formation Realm, like Gu Qianxue and Ying Hongtu.

“Treating us as pushovers?” The black-cloaked youths’ faces twisted with grimaces, watching thirty figures approach.

“Safety first; we just need to hold them off!” Luotian’s voice echoed in their minds.

The thirty figures nodded subtly, their plan clear: defeating World-Transcending Realm cultivators with Soul-Formation Peak strength was nearly impossible. They aimed only to stall until Luotian’s group completed their tribulation.

“Thunderous rumble…” The deep sound of thunder echoed, heavy pressure settling in each heart.

“Haha, this is our first time facing tribulation together!” Xu Liyi smiled, addressing the others.

“Should we disperse?” Shangguan Hongtu blushed, whispering, but drew scornful glances.

“Hmph, a coward!” Xu Liyi mocked Shangguan Hongtu’s demeanor.

“Enough, Shangguan Hongtu. I’ve teased you long enough; I’ll shield your tribulation!” Luotian chuckled, gazing at Shangguan Hongtu and the others.

“Teased?” Shangguan Hongtu’s lips twitched, but he inwardly cursed: “Damn it, I’ve nearly died at your hands multiple times. This is called teasing?”

Yet Shangguan Hongtu didn’t argue. Luotian now possessed the strength to make the Yellow Abyss Sect take him seriously. If Luotian entered World-Transcending Realm today, no one on the Tianyuan Continent could restrain him.

“Crack!” As Shangguan Hongtu pondered, thousands of lightning bolts descended like a sea from the sky, striking the eleven figures.

“Hmph, I’ve told you thunder tribulations are useless against me; yet you insisted on summoning them!” Luotian sneered, his feet humming as he vanished. Simultaneously, three figures of himself appeared before each of Shangguan Hongtu and Jin Wulong.

Each figure was tangible, the lightning striking them producing a deep sound.

“This!” Those within the barrier gazed in astonishment at the ten figures of Luotian, their awe boundless.

“Luotian’s speed has surpassed thunder tribulations; the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven is truly terrifying!” Jiang Nanxuan smiled softly.

“Thunderous rumble…” The thousands of lightning bolts vanished in an instant, leaving the eleven figures revealed.

“Huff…” Luotian exhaled deeply, residual lightning flickering on his body as he gazed at the sky. “Return!”

As Luotian’s words fell, the dense clouds above seemed to heed his voice, gradually dispersing.

“Buzz…” As the clouds vanished, a resounding rumble echoed from all eleven figures’ bodies.

“Warm-up complete; the second tribulation is coming!” Luotian’s face bore anticipation, his gaze slowly turning to the three gray figures凝聚 before him.

Chapter 677: Soul Tribulation

Luotian’s words echoed, and before each of the eleven figures, three gray silhouettes凝聚, identical to their original forms.

“This is the true test for tribulation!” Jiang Nanxuan murmured softly, his gaze filled with anticipation toward the eleven.

“Are they about to converge souls?” Tian Luo smiled, appreciating the three gray illusions before him.

“Succeed!” The onlookers of the Tianyuan Continent’s geniuses shouted loudly, their eyes ablaze with fervor as they gazed at the eleven figures standing proudly in the sky.

“Defeat all three!” Luotian sneered, his body expanding as he charged toward the three identical gray figures.

Fighting himself was no stranger to Luotian; he had done so during his previous three soul tribulations. Though this time there were three, Luotian still handled it effortlessly.

“Kill…” Seeing this, others also charged toward their own illusions, knowing that defeating these three would mean fully entering the World-Transcending Realm. Thus, all eleven fought with their utmost strength, and a thunderous sound echoed above once more.

Meanwhile, Tian Luo and Meng Yao faced a deadlock, their opponents’ numbers and tactics keeping them in check.

Time passed swiftly; within half a moment, the eleven figures finally stirred.

“Buzz…” A cold aura enveloped the world, as if freezing it entirely, causing even those within the array to shiver involuntarily.

“It’s Luohan!”

“Unexpectedly, the first to enter World-Transcending Realm is Luohan!” Their gazes bore joy as they watched the pristine figure in the sky.

At this moment, Luohan’s space within a thousand feet had turned into an icy world. The boundless cold instantly froze the three soul fragments, which trembled on the sky.

“Yield?” Luohan’s lips curled slightly as he extended his hand, shattering the ice. The three soul fragments, with expressions of reverence, transformed into gray mist and entered Luohan’s body.

As the mist entered his body, Luohan’s form trembled; his eyes flashed with brilliance. His aura abruptly changed, and a series of cracking sounds echoed from his body.

“Powerful sensation!” Luohan murmured, feeling like a magnet drawing in surrounding qi.

“Promoted! World-Transcending Early Stage!” The geniuses within the array bore envy, gazing at Luohan wrapped in ice.

World-Transcending Realm—so many yearned for it, yet this young genius had achieved what few could ever reach.

“I’ll test how strong I’ve become!” Luohan extended his hand, summoning four ancient demon elephants that stepped forth from the void.

“Four Elephant Collapse Heaven!” Luohan’s lips curled, his body transforming into an ice arrow as he charged toward the black-cloaked youths battling Tian Luo.

“Buzz…” Before anyone could witness the result, a powerful qi fluctuation invaded their minds.

Leng Qiuchan, Shangguan Hongtu, and others emitted fluctuations; their bodies transformed into black mist, enveloping their three soul fragments. Slowly merging, they entered the World-Transcending Realm.

Their entry into the realm caused a uproar, witnessing three new World-Transcending Realm masters.

After entering the realm, they all rushed toward the other battlefield.

Jin Wulong and Zhou Ziyan opened their eyes shortly after, a smile on their faces.

At this moment, it was daytime; Jin Wulong transformed into a golden dragon, illuminating the sky with roaring dragon cries and the pressure of the dragon clan. He devoured three soul fragments.

Zhou Ziyan remained calm, his three-element qi swirling as he wrapped the three soul fragments in a tight embrace, guiding them into his body.

Chen Changsheng was simpler; he summoned the Locking Soul Pagoda, directly absorbing the three soul fragments into his body with it.

After Chen Changsheng, Xu Liyi and Duan Xingchen among the remaining few also successfully entered the World-Transcending Realm. The only one left was Luotian.

At this moment, Luotian remained calm, gazing at the three soul fragments identical to himself. After fierce battles, they had finally calmed down, cowering before him.

“Absorb…” Luotian didn’t hesitate; he inhaled deeply, drawing the three soul fragments into his body.

“Buzz…” As the three soul fragments entered, Luotian’s body trembled; a smile graced his face. He finally felt whole, though the sensation was subtle yet present.

When the three soul fragments entered his body, Luotian’s mind filled with a multitude of names. He knew these were the names of those who had entered the World-Transcending Realm across the Tianyuan Continent.

Though numerous, Luotian roughly estimated these names wouldn’t exceed a thousand.

“Promoted! Luotian has promoted!” Their faces bore excitement, gazing at the calm Luotian in the sky.

“Wait—his promotion isn’t to Early Stage, but Mid!” A voice shouted in disbelief, watching Luotian’s aura still rising.

“World-Transcending Mid Stage, plus Primordial Power—now I fear no World-Transcending Late!” Luotian clenched his fists, a smile on his face. He then gazed at the battle beyond, his expression turning cold.

“Come on; I’ve endured you long enough. Now, I’ll eradicate you completely!” Luotian spoke softly, his first word barely out before he vanished, appearing before the leading youth.

“Killing Life!” Luotian didn’t hesitate; his Killing Life Fist struck instantly.

Fast—truly fast! Luotian’s speed had reached its peak; even the leading youth, at World-Transcending Early Stage, couldn’t react.

Even Tian Luo was slightly surprised, then smiled again.

“Crack…” The youth’s face bore disbelief; his entire body was shattered by Luotian’s punch, flying backward like a black line.

Chapter 678: Fleeing Soul Fragments

“Hiss…” Seeing Luotian had punched their leader away, the other black-cloaked youths bore shock.

They knew their leader’s strength best; even at World-Transcending Mid, many had fallen to him.

Within the Heaven-Corpse Sect, only the terrifying Yang Huanyu could suppress him, but even that was just a suppression. No one had ever managed to send him flying with a single punch. These youths were witnessing their leader’s first humiliation.

“Good!” The geniuses from other regions within the barrier bore joy, shouting loudly.

Luotian’s punch had greatly boosted morale for the three regions’ young geniuses, who had been frustrated.

The Western Region’s leading youth flew nearly ten thousand feet before stopping, his bones feeling like they were breaking. Worse still, his life force had been taken three thousand years by Luotian’s punch.

“Damn it!” The youth cursed, the first time he had suffered such a loss since his birth.

But as he cursed, Luotian stood in the void, seven illusions appearing before him. Then, with a single punch of轮回 (reincarnation), he struck again.

A tangible reincarnation path emerged under Luotian’s punch, exerting a massive suction force on the youth.

“This is a reincarnation path; Luotian’s punch has fully connected with it!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice calm yet knowing how difficult it was for Luotian to achieve this.

With Jiang Nanxuan’s array mastery, he had created an ultimate array to open the reincarnation path. Jiang Nanxuan hadn’t expected Luotian to connect with it in a single punch.

“Rebellious!” Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s explanation, the youths beside him bore admiration.

At this moment, Luotian was like an invincible war god to them, a mountain that could not be surpassed.

“Yelling…” The youth’s soul was forcibly pulled out half by the reincarnation path, his scream echoing.

“Die!” The youth’s face bore a fierce expression; he extended his hand, countless insects emitting chirps as they flew from his body, covering his soul.

“Buzz…” As Luotian gazed in surprise, the endless insects clung to the youth’s soul, forcibly pulling it back into his body.

The youth’s soul and flesh merged; his face was pale. Luotian’s two punches had clearly injured him.

“Interesting!” Luotian’s lips curled slightly, his gaze filled with amusement as he looked at the black-cloaked youth.

“You must die—die painfully!” The youth’s face bore a grim expression; his body radiated purple and blood qi.

“You people only speak such words. Previously, your two companions also made threats—one hadn’t awakened yet and was killed by me; the other, after awakening, was also killed. Use your abilities now!” Luotian ignored the youth’s intense gaze and spoke casually.

“Go, my children!” The youth’s face bore a look of sorrow; countless black insects formed a black dragon, rushing toward Luotian.

“Again these insects!” Luotian’s eyes gleamed as he gazed at the black insects, showing no resistance as they rushed toward him.

“Idiot! Do you think entering World-Transcending Realm makes you invincible?” The youth’s face bore mockery, gazing at Luotian standing still.

Was Luotian an idiot? Clearly not. He remembered when he had encountered the youth’s companion before, how those insects had been burned to ashes by his碧晶琉璃火 (Verdant Crystal Flame), turning into qi. If not for that, he might have never reached Mid World-Transcending Realm.

“Luotian!” The onlookers, seeing Luotian seemingly stunned as the insects enveloped him, bore disbelief.

They knew from their previous fight how terrifying those insects were; even a few could overwhelm an Elder Realm cultivator.

Within sight, Luotian was instantly enveloped by layers of black insects, his form obscured.

Yet Luotian’s eyes held a smile; the verdant flame in his dantian surged through his meridians, transforming the insects entering his body into waves of qi. This qi was refined by Luotian, even slightly increasing his cultivation.

“Damn it!” The black-cloaked youth and insects were connected; upon Luotian activating the Verdant Crystal Flame, he felt it immediately and ordered the insects to return.

Upon receiving his command, the black insects swiftly flew back toward him.

“Such a big meal—how could you let it escape!” Luotian’s face bore coldness as he waved his hand, enveloping the black insect swarm in a torrent of flames.

“Absorb!” In an instant, cries of pain echoed from the firestorm; within a breath, the insects turned into black powder, absorbed by Luotian’s mouth to enhance his cultivation.

“Any more?” Luotian’s lips curled slightly, addressing the black-cloaked youth as if looking at a milk cow.

“Puke…” Whether it was due to Luotian’s anger or the destruction of his insects, the youth spat blood, his face paler.

“If there’s nothing left, then you can die!” Luotian sneered, his Open Heaven Seal striking with boundless might. It instantly crushed the youth, spewing blood and turning him into a pile of flesh on the ground.

“Buzz…” But it wasn’t over; the youth’s corpse emitted three gray wisps of soul, emitting fear and darting in three directions.

“Soul fragments? World-Transcending Realm masters are indeed hard to kill!” Luotian shook his head slightly.

“But for me, who possesses the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven, it’s effortless!” Luotian’s words echoed as his body became a blur. In the next moment, he reappeared at the original spot, holding three soul fragments in his hands.

Chapter 679: Rest and Return

“Want to escape? Can you?” Luotian’s face bore amusement as he gazed at the three soul fragments.

“Luotian, release me; I’ll defect from the Heaven-Corpse Sect and pledge allegiance to you!” The three gray soul fragments spoke in unison, their gazes filled with entreaty.

“Hmph… the Heaven-Corpse Sect is known for its unyielding spirit, yet you’ve changed?” Gu Lei, having been replaced by others, sneered at the three soul fragments.

Luotian, however, lacked patience; his face bore coldness: “You’ve killed over ten thousand people on the Tianyuan Continent. I won’t let you live. But you’re still useful to me!”

“Soul Extraction!” Luotian’s eyes flashed like lightning, his hand pressing onto one soul fragment. The youth’s memories surfaced in Luotian’s mind.

“Only childhood memories are useless to me!” Luotian discarded the extracted soul fragment to Gu Lei, then began searching the second.

Within moments, Luotian had scanned all three soul fragments but found no results—just like the previous youth. They only knew that soon, the Western Regions would unleash war, slaughtering the entire Tianyuan Continent. Yet they didn’t know the exact timing.

“Alas…” Luotian sighed, burning the soul fragment and feeling a bad premonition.

“Hope we exit before the war begins!” Luotian murmured, his eyes filled with concern. He couldn’t fathom how the Northern Regions’ sects would withstand the mighty Heaven-Corpse Sect.

Though the Heaven-Corpse Sect had suffered greatly in the Xiangu Continent, after years of recovery, it was surely restored.

“Thunderous rumble…” As Luotian sighed, the battle elsewhere neared its end. Though there were minor setbacks, a few had sustained light injuries.

The Western Region’s group was strong, but who could match the twelve who had inherited the Twelve Emperor Powers? The difference was evident. The Western Region’s group lacked Primordial Power.

If not for their toxic methods, they might have been killed by Xu Liyi and others long ago. Though they had resisted for a while, ultimately, their soul fragments were captured by the eleven and burned to ashes by Meng Yao’s black flames.

At the moment these soul fragments died, the Western Region’s youths’ bodies exploded into pieces, transforming into swarms of insects under people’s stunned gazes.

“Don’t let these insects escape!” Luotian roared, the Verdant Crystal Flame surging again. Meng Yao’s black flames also flew from her hands. Together, they annihilated the vast insect swarm, turning it into dust that drifted through the heavens.

“Everyone, I’ll gift you this!” Luotian gazed at the dust-like powder swirling in the sky, his hand waving. A gust of wind emerged from his palm, blowing toward Gu Qianxue’s group within the barrier.

“Refine this powder!” Luotian didn’t wait for their response, addressing Gu Qianxue again.

“Refining these insects? No toxicity?” People bore confusion, whispering among themselves.

But Gu Qianxue’s group, who had long trusted Luotian, sat on the ground and began refining the powder.

“Just this powder isn’t enough,” Luotian murmured, his face showing resolve.

“Alright, no child is worth the wolf!” Luotian’s heart hardened; he took out three pills from under Zhang Daotian’s bed—two ninth-grade and one eighth-grade.

Luotian’s eyes bore regret; eighth-grade pills were rare, while ninth-grade ones were treasures. After years of preservation, these three pills remained intact, proving their power.

“Crack!” Luotian pinched the eighth-grade pill, which shattered into waves of qi filling the heavens. The rich herbal essence made people’s minds feel refreshed.

“Crack!” Luotian trembled as he crushed the ninth-grade pill. The second ninth-grade pill, however, he couldn’t bear to crush; he carefully stored it away.

“Roar…” As Luotian crushed the ninth-grade pill, a series of roars echoed in people’s ears. The powerful qi transformed into long dragons, rushing toward those seated.

People bore gratitude, gazing at Luotian before closing their eyes to refine the fierce qi.

“Damn it, you son of a bitch have such an amazing pill!” Xu Liyi’s face bore envy as he gazed at the swirling qi.

Others also showed surprise, inwardly sighing—Luotian’s fortune in the Xiangu Ruins was immense.

“I can only help you this far; whether you promote or not depends on your own!” Luotian smiled, gazing at the thousands seated.

Luotian wasn’t without other methods, but they were reserved for Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. If these people couldn’t promote to World-Transcending Realm, he would undoubtedly use them to help Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. As for others, he could only assist this far.

“Luotian, what’s next? The Xiangu Ruins probably have nothing left,” Xu Liyi asked, gazing at Luotian.

Hearing Xu Liyi’s words, others also turned their gazes to Luotian, awaiting his decision.

“Jiang, you know this place better than us. Are there any places in the Xiangu Continent to enhance your strength?” Luotian smiled, addressing Jiang Nanxuan.

“Nothing else! Except my previous life’s cave, there’s nothing more!” Jiang Nanxuan answered truthfully. As a World-Transcending Sage in his past life, he had traversed the entire Xiangu Continent. Though now he was Jiang Nanxuan, a sense from the heavens still lingered.

“Then can we rest and prepare to leave?” Luotian smiled, having already planned to depart. He was worried about the situation outside the Tianyuan Continent. Their current strength was terrifying, enough to sweep through any sect. If they left, it would surely have a significant impact.

“Leaving is possible, but do you know how to exit?” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly to Luotian.

Chapter 680: The Elder

“Leaving is possible, but do you know how to exit?” Jiang Nanxuan stood calmly, his gaze carrying a smile as he looked at Luotian.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Luotian was stunned for a moment before gazing blankly. Xu Liyi and the other eleven also heard their conversation, their faces equally stunned.

“Indeed! We only know how to enter but not how to exit. Our sects never told us how!” Shangguan Hongtu sighed, his face filled with disappointment.

He had imagined returning to his sect and being respected, but now a major problem stood before them—the unknown method of exiting.

Not only Shangguan Hongtu, but others also shook their heads, exchanging bewildered glances.

“I understand now!” Luotian’s face bore a bitter smile; he had finally realized why his elder and sect leader had looked so subtle.

The elders of their sect clearly knew about the impending battle, placing them in the Xiangu Ruins to protect them.

Not only did Luotian understand, but others also bore comprehension in their eyes, their gazes softening.

“No, I must leave and face the sect’s fate!” Shangguan Hongtu’s face turned red. The Xiangu Ruins journey had matured him, making him understand the pain of losing a sect.

Especially when he thought about how his ancestors in the Yelllow Abyss Sect had cherished him, even risking everything to revive him. This made Shangguan Hongtu unable to sit still.

Seeing Shangguan Hongtu’s excitement, Luotian and others were astonished. Shangguan Hongtu had always been seen as a second-generation prince, but his current determination and resolve made them look at him differently.
