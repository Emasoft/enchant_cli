“Senior, you!” Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion, unsure of the old man’s meaning.

“I am Qiu Tianchi!” Luo Tian responded, revealing his name and identity.

“I hope you will rise in the Heaven-Soaring Continent, leading humanity to finally break free from the oppression and enslavement of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans!” The old man spoke softly, his eyes flashing with hatred.

“Today, I will sacrifice this old body to send you to the Heaven-Soaring Continent!” The old man’s face was wild, his aura suddenly surging violently.

“Old fool, you truly dare! With the two of us here, what tricks can you pull? Do you think that by cultivating to the Early Epoch, we wouldn’t guard against it?” A senior from Qixian Clan scoffed, his hands moving as invisible waves erupted from him.

“Hum…” A moment later, a green麒麟 (qilin) seal flashed on Zhang Jingfu’s neck, roaring as it spread across the old man’s body.

“Go!” The old man grimaced in pain, his eyes wild. He pushed Luo Tian forward, unleashing all his cultivation into a cascade of runes that vanished into the void.

A gray passage instantly appeared before Luo Tian, causing his eyes to flicker. He bowed respectfully to the old man before stepping into the passage.

“Return!” Seeing Luo Tian enter, two elders from Qixian Clan roared, their hands reaching out to grasp him fiercely.

“You return!” But as their massive hands neared the passage’s entrance, a withered figure appeared before them. Though frail, it stood like an unshakable monument.

“Hurry!” The old man shouted at Luo Tian, spitting blood as a crimson dragon burst from his mouth, colliding with the elders’ hands.

“Boom…” Thunderous explosions echoed as the old man expelled the crimson dragon. Zhang Jingfu’s body instantly turned to a desiccated corpse, shattered by the explosion and vanishing into the starry void.

The vast passage also disappeared with the explosion, darkening the three men’s faces.

“Even if you escape to that human clan's newly established gathering place, the iron cavalry of the Ten Thousand Clans will surely crush the Heaven-Soaring Continent.” They sneered, then flew into the continent.

Chapter 1509: The Early Years of the Heaven-Sundering Lord

The immense teleportation force struck Luo Tian’s body. Having endured countless battles and sustaining severe injuries, the intense dizziness made him want to fall into a deep sleep.

“How long has it been since I felt this?” Luo Tian sighed bitterly, never expecting to relive the sensation of the Sage Stage.

Dazed, he didn’t know how long passed before he emerged into the vast starry void, exhaling deeply.

A massive continent appeared in his vision, far larger than the current Tianyuan Continent by a few times.

“Heaven-Swooping Continent?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened with admiration, scanning the surroundings with anticipation.

“Unbelievable, the star regions of ancient times are like this!” He gazed into the distance, sensing the atmosphere here was vastly different from the current Nine Domains. It was a vast star region, not divided into nine parts.

“Rules!” He suddenly shook, finally realizing the difference—rules.

“Hum…” Before he could react, a humming sound filled his perception, making him frown slightly.

“Cough cough…” A disheveled figure appeared in his vision, causing Luo Tian to sigh deeply.

The man was a strong young man, his body covered in blood and radiating a fierce aura. Even Luo Tian felt surprised.

“Brother, where did you escape from?” The strong youth smiled, addressing Luo Tian as if his wounds didn’t exist.

“I escaped from a continent of the Qilin Clan!” Luo Tian replied, his eyes warm.

“Tough times. I escaped from a continent of the Yan Clan. Our entire continent had nearly a hundred thousand people, but only I was sent out by the elders—everyone else died!” The youth spoke, his voice filled with anger and hatred.

“Ah, I’m no different!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Though he knew it was all fake, he could feel the sorrow within this body—nearly a hundred thousand people, only he had escaped. Even those at the Early Epoch level were annihilated. He didn’t need to guess; he knew those who hadn’t escaped would be exterminated by the Qilin Clan.

“No wonder humanity’s hatred for the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans is so fierce. The oppression must have been severe back then!” Luo Tian mused, realizing he and this youth were just the tip of the iceberg in this vast star region. He didn’t know how many others had been slaughtered by the Ancient Kings, leaving no path to survival.

While records spoke of it, experiencing and witnessing it was another matter. In Qiu Tianchi’s memories, Luo Tian saw the brutal oppression of humanity.

“Brother, what’s your name? We’re both in the same boat; let’s travel together in Heaven-Swooping to help each other!” Luo Tian sensed something unusual about the youth and asked.

“I’m Wang Duantian. You’re right, Heaven-Swooping is a newly established human continent. With our low strength, it’s better to have each other’s back!” The youth smiled.

“Wang Duantian!” Upon hearing this, Luo Tian’s heart stopped. His eyes widened in disbelief, his head ringing as if struck by lightning. He stared intently at the youth.

“Du… Duantian, the Heaven-Sundering Lord!” Luo Tian whispered, trembling. He knew the true name of the Heaven-Sundering Lord and was stunned to see his early years.

“Qiu Tianchi!” Then Luo Tian suddenly remembered who he was, his heart pounding with excitement.

The Heaven-Sundering Lord, the first supreme being of humanity. Around him were countless strong figures. Qiu Tianchi was his most important brother, reaching the peak of a near-Era Master.

This Qiu Tianchi was also the one Wang Duantian felt most guilty toward. Legends said Qiu Tianchi had died for unknown reasons, and when the Heaven-Sundering Lord ascended to his supreme position, he eradicated an entire royal clan. This act reduced the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans to eight, plunging them into despair.

“Unbelievable! I’ve become Qiu Tianchi. I wonder what benefits await me in the end!” Luo Tian smiled, his heart racing with excitement and curiosity about how Qiu Tianchi had died.

“Brother, what’s wrong? Why are you smiling?” The young Heaven-Sundering Lord, Wang Duantian, looked puzzled, unaware he was the future supreme of humanity.

“Nothing… Nothing. Let’s go in!” Luo Tian smiled, then moved with Wang Duantian toward the vast Heaven-Swooping Continent.

“Hum…” After flying for a while, they landed on the massive continent. As Luo Tian stepped onto the ground, a humming sound filled his mind, and the surroundings twisted instantly.

“Already someone entered the second layer so quickly?” In the ninth level of the Qiankun震魂 Tower, the gray elder was stunned, then smiled in satisfaction.

“Excellent. I wasn’t wrong about you—Qiu Tianchi chose you!” The tower’s spirit sighed, then turned its gaze to the three children playing nearby.

“Ah…” Others also faced the same dilemma as Luo Tian. Jinzi, bloodied and exhausted, barely escaped from the domain’s edge, his body nearly shattered.

Others faced similar fates, engaging in battles. However, their sudden identity shifts made them uneasy. Killing Ancient Kings made their progress slow, and compared to Luo Tian’s strength, they were at a disadvantage. Thus, they found it extremely difficult.

“This is too hard!” Fuxingyue spat blood, clashing with a golden raven clan prodigy, burned black by golden flames.

Others weren’t much better. The only one slightly better was Fuxingxuan, perhaps due to Xiaogan’s influence. Fuxingxuan faced only a Sage Stage Mid-Period opponent, making it manageable.

“Boom…” Tu Feiyang’s transformed human warrior was crushed into blood mist by a vampire clan Sage Stage Peak opponent, making Tu Feiyang want to vomit.

“This is the fourth time!” Tu Feiyang emerged from the Qiankun Zhenhun Tower, eyes wild. He bit his teeth and re-entered the tower.

As Tu Feiyang rushed in, Manhun’s massive body crashed down, his face郁闷 (disappointed), eyes filled with resentment. He stepped back into the tower.

Two pitiful companions were constantly battered by opponents far stronger, endlessly entering and exiting the tower.

“Hum…” The scene changed repeatedly. Luo Tian felt like he had time-traveled, appearing on a high platform. A young man faced him with contempt.

“Is it you who stood up for Wang Duantian?” The mocking voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, leaving him momentarily unprepared.

“Uh…” Luo Tian froze. Then his mind filled with memories, revealing understanding.

“A Sage Stage Late Period?” Luo Tian smiled, checking his cultivation. Seeing the opponent was also at Sage Stage Late Period, he felt relieved.

“Hmm?” Then his eyes brightened. He had acquired a martial art called “Breaking Heaven’s Strike” in his mind.

“I must have completed the first layer’s trial. This martial art is likely the reward!” Luo Tian realized, then understood why the opponent was here.

After Qiu Tianchi and Wang Duantian entered the Heaven-Swooping Continent, their treatment differed. Wang Duantian had average talent, while Qiu Tianchi’s was far better.

Wang Duantian was often bullied, and Qiu Tianchi constantly defended him. Thus, Qiu Tianchi had made many enemies.

Though the people of Heaven-Swooping shared a common enemy—the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans—conflicts arose among the many. Eventually, someone provoked Qiu Tianchi and united with those he had offended before to “invite” him and Wang Duantian to the platform.

“Don’t be too harsh!” A low voice echoed from below the platform. Wang Duantian’s eyes were anxious, watching Luo Tian on the stage.

“Single combat against an Ancient Clan prodigy?” Luo Tian smiled, instantly understanding what this trial was.

“Does it matter?” Luo Tian looked at Wang Duantian below, secretly smiling: “Brother, now that I’m helping you, are you going to repay me later?”

But soon, Luo Tian’s expression changed. A strange feeling arose in his heart, as if this scene was familiar.

“Kill…” Before Luo Tian could think further, the opponent rushed at him with a sword, making Luo Tian’s lips curl slightly.

“I really want to see what talent the Ancient Era prodigies have!” Luo Tian mused, then drew a green sword.

Chapter 1510: The Heaven-Swooping Rankings

“Qiu Tianchi has been making a name for himself in the Heaven-Swooping Continent. That genius who escaped from the Qilin Clan?” The crowd murmured, eyes filled with mockery as they looked at Luo Tian.

The Heaven-Swooping Continent had a Heaven-Swooping Rankings. Names on the list were all renowned figures within the continent. The young man attacking Luo Tian was a top 100 contender, named Kuang Hongxin.

“Kill!” The green sword flashed like a snake, striking Luo Tian at an odd angle.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian marveled at the opponent’s strength, which was slightly better than the prodigies of the Nine Domains. Though not as strong as Tu Feiyang’s group, it was still impressive—only top 100, not the top few.

Yet Luo Tian felt more curious. How had the Heaven-Sundering Lord risen? It seemed he had once lived an ordinary life.

“Hum…” The golden sword emitted a resonant sound, clashing with Kuang Hongxin’s green blade.

Sparks flew. After a brief clash, both retreated. Kuang Hongxin looked surprised.

“Good. No wonder you’re so arrogant. You can withstand my sword!” Kuang Hongxin praised, his voice filled with admiration.

“But now it won’t be so easy!” Kuang Hongxin swung his green sword again, sending a stream of green sword qi like serpents to attack Luo Tian.

“Poison Sword! Kuang Hongxin’s specialty!” The crowd gasped, eyes filled with excitement and pity for Luo Tian.

“No escape? No place to hide?” Luo Tian frowned, his mind tense. Each sword qi perfectly sealed every escape route.

“You can’t run!” Kuang Hongxin smiled triumphantly, waiting for Luo Tian to be wounded by his technique.

“Who said I wanted to run?” A playful voice echoed in Kuang Hongxin’s ears. Golden sword qi erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, bursting outward.

“Dao Without Borders!” Luo Tian roared. Golden sword qi storms swept around him, with Luo Tian standing at the center.

Three Thousand Dao Paths instantly filled people’s perceptions, leaving onlookers stunned.

“Unbelievable! This small-name Qiu Tianchi has mastered half of the Era’s understanding!” People hadn’t expected this rising star to grasp a technique only a near-Era Master could achieve.

“Boom…” The golden sword qi storms clashed with the green serpents. Roars echoed, and the green serpents were annihilated by the golden storms.

Kuang Hongxin’s triumphant expression froze. “How is this possible?” He gasped, stunned that his powerful attack was so easily countered.

“Sword Without Borders!” Before Kuang Hongxin could finish, a deep voice echoed. Luo Tian used the幽冥鬼步 (Yao Ming Gui Bu) and vanished from his spot.

Golden light flashed. The void shattered, a golden light rising from Kuang Hongxin’s back and piercing his heart.

“Spurt…” Blood splattered. The golden sword pierced Kuang Hongxin’s chest, leaving the crowd stunned. Everyone stopped their chatter, watching Luo Tian holding the sword behind Kuang Hongxin.

Too fast! Luo Tian’s attack was too quick for anyone to react. The golden sword had already pierced Kuang Hongxin’s heart.

“Do you have any more questions?” Luo Tian pulled the sword out, his eyes cold as he looked at Kuang Hongxin. Though the sword was removed, Dao Paths spread through Kuang Hongxin’s body. If Luo Tian wished, Kuang Hongxin’s life was in his hands.

“No more. I yield!” Kuang Hongxin looked defeated, the first time he had lost to someone. There was no reason to refuse.

“How strong! This Qiu Tianchi was famous before, but he wasn’t this strong!” The crowd murmured, eyes filled with disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian.

“Brother, how strong you are!” Young Heaven-Sundering Lord Wang Duantian approached Luo Tian, his eyes filled with admiration.

“Nothing, nothing. You’ll be stronger than me in the future!” Luo Tian smiled, his voice sincere.

“How can I surpass you? There’s no hope for me!” Wang Duantian looked sad, shaking his head.

“Don’t worry. I said you’ll become the supreme of humanity; you will!” Luo Tian smiled, patting Wang Duantian’s shoulder.

“Yeah, I’ll become a strength like yours!” Wang Duantian’s eyes shone with determination.

Luo Tian nodded in approval. In Qiu Tianchi’s memories, he knew Wang Duantian had average talent but relentless effort.

“Haha. Just because you’re a waste, do you think finding such a patron makes me not dare to touch you?” A playful voice echoed in Luo Tian and Wang Duantian’s ears.

“Hum…” Wind stirred. Several figures appeared, making Luo Tian frown slightly before smiling.

“At last, some real challenge!” Luo Tian mused, his battle spirit rising as he looked at the figures walking forward with people’s reverence.

“Shi Zizhen! The third-ranked Shi Zizhen on the Heaven-Swooping Rankings. How did Wang Duantian offend such a person!” The crowd erupted, making way for the figures.

“Not only did Shi Zizhen come, but Lu Feizhou, second-ranked, also arrived. They’re close friends and were taken as disciples by two human clan’s near-Emperor Masters!” The crowd chattered, watching the two powerful figures emerge.

“Sage Stage Peak?” Luo Tian sighed. He knew the second layer’s trial was no easy task.

“Both are near-Era Masters!” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, his eyes flashing with light.

“Wang Duantian, come here. Kneel and apologize for offending me. That’s settled. And you, Qiu Tianchi, can’t kneel. You must sever your limbs!” A cold voice echoed from behind Shi Zizhen and Lu Feizhou, filled with resentment.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian didn’t even glance at the youth behind them, responding boldly. He had no patience to care about reasons; it was a trial. If he guessed right, defeating or killing these two prodigies would be the second layer’s final test.

“Brave indeed!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian and Wang Duantian’s ears. Invisible pressure struck their bodies.

“Now it’s too late to regret!” Shi Zizhen stepped onto the platform, walking toward Luo Tian and Wang Duantian. Each step echoed like a thunderclap in their ears, invisible waves striking their bodies.

Wang Duantian’s body trembled. He looked at Shi Zizhen, fear in his eyes.

“You’ll become the strongest of humanity. This Sage Stage Peak trash can be killed with just a glance!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in Wang Duantian’s mind, making his body shake.

“I’ll become a strength like Brother Qiu!” Wang Duantian’s eyes hardened, his aura rising as he resisted Shi Zizhen’s pressure.

Luo Tian stepped on the ground, smiling at Shi Zizhen: “Say what you want. This pressure means nothing to me.”

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s words echoed, his aura surging. It was stronger than Shi Zizhen’s. His eyes looked down on Shi Zizhen.

“Crack…” The platform ground shattered under Luo Tian’s step, a terrifying wave sweeping toward Shi Zizhen.

“What’s happening!” Shi Zizhen’s face changed, surprise in his eyes. He looked at Luo Tian walking toward him, but now Luo Tian seemed to tower over him. This feeling he had only felt from great masters who could crush him effortlessly.

“Step… step… step…” With each step, Shi Zizhen’s face showed shock, retreating one step. It was a soul-piercing suppression he couldn’t resist.

“Go…!” Luo Tian coldly ordered, his voice icy. It echoed in Shi Zizhen’s mind like a devil’s whisper, making his body tremble.

Shi Zizhen retreated, sweat pouring. He hadn’t expected to meet someone like Luo Tian, instantly stunning his mind.

“What’s going on? Qiu Tianchi is only at Sage Stage Late Period. Why does he suppress Shi Zizhen so much? Even without using his hands, just his aura made him look so pitiful!” The crowd looked shocked, watching Shi Zizhen retreating and about to fall off the platform.

Chapter 1511: Facing the Ancient Era

“Kill!” As Shi Zizhen retreated, a sky-shaking blade slash flew from his back, scattering debris and slicing toward Luo Tian.

With the blade’s appearance, the pressure that had stunned Shi Zizhen vanished. He returned to normal.

“Boom…” Lu Feizhou’s face was cold as he landed on the platform, his eyes filled with concern. He could feel that this Qiu Tianchi, though only at Sage Stage Late Period, was no ordinary opponent.

“Lu Feizhou has arrived! He’s holding the Broken Soul Blade! This is serious!” The crowd gasped, watching Lu Feizhou with a gray long blade, discussing loudly.

Luo Tian saw the blade slash approaching and smirked. His sword hummed, golden sword qi erupting to clash with the gray blade.

“Blocked?”
“This Qiu Tianchi must have a background. How can he block Lu Feizhou’s attack at Sage Stage Late Period!” The crowd erupted again, eyes filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian had shocked them repeatedly. First defeating Kuang Hongxin in two moves, then suppressing Shi Zizhen without using his hands. Then he had clashed with Lu Feizhou directly.

“Will you fight together or one by one?” Luo Tian held his golden sword, scanning Lu Feizhen and Shi Zizhen.

“Arrogant!” The crowd’s faces showed mockery, looking at Luo Tian as if he were suicidal.

“Lu Feizhou and Shi Zizhen are the pillars of human prodigies. They have special privileges—kill rights. If this Qiu Tianchi is so arrogant, they’ll kill him and he’ll be dead for nothing!” The crowd watched Luo Tian, whispering.

“You think we’d fight together?” Lu Feizhou sneered. His long blade vanished, appearing before Luo Tian instantly. The gray blade fell heavily.

The gray blade severed the void, appearing above Luo Tian’s head. Lu Feizhou didn’t slash a blade but appeared with his body, like a mountain crushing Luo Tian. His eyes were filled with seriousness.

“Hum…” The sword flashed, Luo Tian showed no fear. Golden blade light erupted, blocking in front of him. It clashed with Lu Feizhou’s gray blade.

The explosion echoed, a crackling sound in people’s ears. Luo Tian bent his body, golden sword shattered but blocked Lu Feizhou’s attack. His palm was slightly torn.

“Not enough weapons?” Luo Tian sighed, then looked at Lu Feizhou who had jumped again. His spiritual energy ocean surged.

“Boom… Boom…” Intense explosions echoed in Luo Tian’s body, like another powerful soul awakening. Black demon energy surged.

“What technique is this!” People watched Luo Tian’s rising aura, shocked again by his methods.

Not only the crowd but also Lu Feizhou and Shi Zizhen looked surprised. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s aura to be so intimidating, even giving them a strong sense of danger.

“No need for Sage Stage Peak. You’re still paper to me!” Lu Feizhou was only surprised, then checked Luo Tian’s cultivation. His gray blade fell again.

“Hum…” Black demon sword suddenly凝聚 (congealed), Luo Tian’s robe flapped like a mighty demon, raising the sword again to clash with Lu Feizhou’s gray Broken Soul Blade.

“Crush…” In an instant, the two swords with overwhelming energy collided. Luo Tian’s black sword shattered again, leaving the crowd in shock.

“Another block!” They gasped. In their eyes, blocking Lu Feizhou’s attack was already incredible. After all, he was the second-ranked contender on the Heaven-Swooping Rankings.

“Again!” Lu Feizhou shouted, his eyes filled with excitement. He had never met someone who dared to fight him so straightforwardly.

Veins bulged on his arms. Next moment, the gray Broken Soul Blade surged, slicing toward Luo Tian.

“Don’t fear me!” Luo Tian roared, black demon swords constantly凝聚 (congealed) in his hands. He faced Lu Feizhou’s powerful attack without fear.

Explosions echoed repeatedly, black demon swords shattering in his hands. Luo Tian and Lu Feizhou’s figures became more battered.

“Good, it’s been a while since I had fun. If you can withstand my next three blades, I’ll protect your life in the Heaven-Swooping Continent. You’ll live well. If you can’t, then your life ends!” Lu Feizhou looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Stop talking nonsense. I didn’t expect this era’s prodigies to be so talkative!” Luo Tian looked at Lu Feizhou with disdain, speaking words people didn’t understand.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian’s words ended, Lu Feizhou’s Broken Soul Blade emitted a humming sound.

“Broken Soul Blade, one strike to sever the horizon!” Lu Feizhou whispered, his gray long blade emitting ten thousand sword qi. Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed.

“Unsurpassed, the prodigies of the Ancient Era aren’t ordinary!” Luo Tian looked at the gray sword qi, his face filled with seriousness.

“Yet now the Nine Domains are no worse than the Ancient Era, even more brilliant. Prodigies abound!” Luo Tian mused, black demon sword凝聚 (congealed) in his hand.

“Three strikes of Broken Soul?” Shi Zizhen smiled, watching Lu Feizhou’s overwhelming aura. He knew Lu Feizhou now took Luo Tian seriously, as the Three Strikes of Broken Soul was his secret technique.

“Seventh Strike!” Luo Tian roared, black sword qi erupted. The black sword qi pierced the sky, rushing toward Lu Feizhou’s devastating blade.

“Kid, you still use that attitude?” Lu Feizhou warned Luo Tian. Seeing him still use the Reversing Heaven’s Seven Demon Blades, he was slightly annoyed.

“Of course. After all, you’re a great prodigy!” Luo Tian smiled, his hands moving. Black energy surged again,凝聚 (congealed) a black demon sword above his head.

“Breaking Heaven’s Strike!” Luo Tian roared, the black sword qi flew out. This technique was from Qiu Tianchi’s memories and was a reward for passing the first layer.

“Hum…” Breaking Heaven’s Strike instantly struck, clashing with Lu Feizhou’s first strike of the Three Strikes.

“Boom…” Thunderous explosions echoed. The platform set by a near-Era Master trembled under their clash.

“Even Lu Feizhou’s Three Strikes of Broken Soul were blocked!” The crowd gasped, their faces filled with amazement.

“Stacked Momentum!”

Seeing his technique blocked by Luo Tian, Lu Feizhou showed no surprise. His aura surged again, more terrifying than the first strike.

The sword qi expanded again, filling the sky. Its overwhelming power made Luo Tian feel a sense of fear.

“Stacked Momentum? Accumulating the first strike’s momentum to the second?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in shock. He could imagine how terrifying Lu Feizhou’s second strike would be.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian was stunned, the sky-filling gray sword qi approached him with overwhelming power, as if it could annihilate everything.

Gray lightning crackled on the blade. Gray energy wrapped around it, as if countless souls were entangled in the blade.

“Breaking Heaven’s Strike!” Luo Tian chanted the Feathered Immortal Scripture, his right hand holding the sword while his left unleashed the Brahma Attack Technique into the black demon sword.

“Go!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and the black demon sword flew to his head. It surged with overwhelming power, clashing with Lu Feizhou’s second strike.

“What technique is this?” Everyone was shocked. They watched Luo Tian, a Sage Stage Late Period cultivator, using such an incredible technique.

“I’ve never seen Brother Qiu use this before!” Wang Duantian stood in the crowd, stunned. He hadn’t expected Qiu Tianchi to be so strong.

“Still, you’re only at Sage Stage Late Period. Even with such techniques, your strength is still insufficient!” Lu Feizhou shook his head, confident in his attack.

“Yes, that’s true.” Luo Tian smiled, then grabbed the air with his hands. An invisible wave spread.

“Eight Directions’ Treasure Sealing Technique!” Luo Tian smiled, then slowly pressed his hands into the void.

Humming echoed. As Luo Tian’s words ended, Lu Feizhou’s second strike of the Broken Soul Blade trembled violently. It began to twist, deviating from its original path.

“What’s happening!” The onlookers were stunned. They hadn’t expected this change, even Shi Zizhen and Lu Feizhou were confused.

“Damn it!” But soon, Lu Feizhou’s face turned grim as the black sword qi expanded.

Chapter 1512: Experiencing a Near-Era Master

The black sword qi, filled with overwhelming power, expanded in Lu Feizhou’s eyes. His face turned grim. The blade that should have clashed with his second strike of the Broken Soul Blade had instead flown toward him.

“Boom…” In an instant, the black demon sword struck Lu Feizhou’s body. The powerful Lu Feizhou was split into blood mist, floating in the crowd's view.

Meanwhile, the gray Broken Soul Blade deviated from its original path but still rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Stop for me!” Luo Tian roared, his voice commanding. He pushed the air with both hands, sending another invisible wave. A strange phenomenon made the crowd gasp.

“Hum…” The powerful humming sound echoed in their ears. That overwhelming second strike of the Broken Soul Blade advanced, but its power was rapidly consumed. By the time it reached Luo Tian, its strength had dropped several times.

“Boom…” Luo Tian waved his fist, shattering the gray blade in front of everyone. Then he moved toward Lu Feizhou’s blood, which was regenerating.

Dao Paths spread, golden runes flew from Luo Tian’s hands, instantly wrapping the blood emitting gray energy.
