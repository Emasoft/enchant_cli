“Enough. Stop arguing. Luo Chen, as a Sect Heir, stole from the Treasure Vault; his death penalty may be spared, but his living punishment is unavoidable. He shall be sent to Reincarnation Hell to reflect before the Mirror of Sins.”

“If in the Ten Palace Grand Tournament, the younger generation fails to secure the top three positions, they shall be executed!” The Black and White Officials looked at Du Jianxing and Yu Tian, then spoke to settle the matter.

Upon hearing the Black and White Officials’ decree, the eight deputy palace masters fell silent. They could argue, but once the Black and White Officials had decided, their arguments held no weight.

“Same for the other palaces’ Sect Heirs—his strength is certainly not enough to secure the top three!” Yu Tian, recalling the other palaces’ power, felt reassured.

Chapter 2172: Residue ()

After the matter of Luo Tian’s exile was settled, everyone, including Du Jianxing, left the first level and returned to their quarters. The hall was now left only with Luo Tian and the Black and White Officials.

Gazing at the half-black, half-white figures of the Black and White Officials, Luo Tian felt a chill. A bitter smile formed on his face as he recalled his earlier humiliation before the Mirror of Sins, and instinctively shivered.

“I wish I could kill you! If you don’t secure the top three in the Ten Palace Grand Tournament, you’ll die. If you do, you can go anywhere—no one will stop you! Get out!”

“Also, I told you before: giving you a chance to obtain the Mirror of Sins was already an opportunity. It’s not that I broke my word!” The Black and White Officials smacked their hands, sending Luo Tian flying out of the hall.

A force beyond resistance struck Luo Tian’s body, as if shattering space itself. With a single slap, they hurled him into Reincarnation Hell.

“Plop…” Luo Tian offered no resistance and fell directly into the Yellow River of Death, gulping down a mouthful of Yellow River water.

“I’m innocent!” Luo Tian floated atop the Yellow River, shouting, but he knew even the Black and White Officials could not hear his cries in this realm of reincarnation.

Luo Tian swam toward the gray bridge’s head, but he saw no sign of Fu Xingxuan. He guessed she had gone into seclusion.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sat on the long bridge, sighing deeply. He knew Fu Xingxuan’s absence meant he could not escape Reincarnation Hell; the next time he left would be when his sentence ended.

“How long will the Black and White Officials keep me here?” Luo Tian cursed aloud, frustration mounting.

“Butan Shi, you bastard—come out!” Luo Tian shouted again, knowing Butan Shi was nearby. Though the restrictions had little effect on it, they still allowed Luo Tian to sense its general location.

“Master, don’t touch those restrictions—my body can’t take it!” Butan Shi’s pitiful voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

Though Luo Tian’s methods could repel Butan Shi, they clearly caused it immense pain.

“Just come out!” Luo Tian demanded again, searching every corner for Butan Shi’s presence.

“Then promise me you won’t throw me into the latrine!” Butan Shi replied.

“I promise!” Luo Tian coldly said, not because he wanted to throw Butan Shi into the latrine but because he himself could not escape.

“Once a promise is made, it’s hard to retract! Keep your word!” Butan Shi insisted. Then, it appeared before Luo Tian’s eyes.

“You bastard!” Luo Tian grabbed Butan Shi with his hand.

“Tell me, how did you find me? This is the second time you’ve tricked me!”

“Also, you took benefits from the Treasure Vault and split them with me. I bore the blame for that! Don’t say you didn’t leave anything—I don’t believe it!” Luo Tian glared at Butan Shi, his eyes filled with menace.

“Master, I truly have nothing left! However, this place feels familiar to me!” Butan Shi spoke, jumping wildly on Luo Tian’s hand but unable to break free.

“Damn it—this is the Yellow River of Death! Reincarnation Hell!” Butan Shi suddenly shouted, his voice filled with disbelief.

“Do you know Reincarnation Hell?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered slightly. He remembered Butan Shi had once said it fell from the sky, and he’d thought it was boasting.

“How could I not know? This is what I created when I fell from the sky!” Butan Shi’s voice carried pride.

“Hmph, I smell my familiar aura here!” Before Luo Tian could respond, Butan Shi’s voice echoed again in his mind.

“Stop talking nonsense! Answer my two questions first, or I’ll throw you into the latrine!” Luo Tian interrupted Butan Shi’s speech.

“You broke your word!” Butan Shi immediately protested, and the two—man and stone—began arguing on the gray long bridge.

Eventually, Butan Shi relented, unwilling to lose face. His voice carried a tone of entreaty as he explained: “Master, I truly have nothing left. However, there are fragments of my body here—its strength is quite good. Let me help you collect it!”

“As for finding me, simply activate your bloodline power to summon me, and I’ll appear. Master, I’ve even revealed my true strength to you—don’t betray me!” Butan Shi spoke cautiously.

“Hmm, I’ll see your performance,” Luo Tian finally nodded in satisfaction. He then gazed at the rolling Yellow River.

“The Black and White Officials sent me here under the pretense of punishment, claiming it was giving me a chance to obtain the Mirror of Sins. It was all nonsense!”

“I definitely can’t get the Mirror of Sins. I’ll just stay here and cultivate quietly. I wonder where Fu Xingxuan went into seclusion!” Luo Tian muttered to himself.

“Master, the fragments that fell from me are right here in the Yellow River water. I never thought someone would refine them into a treasure! Truly talented!”

“Master, let me help you collect this item!” Butan Shi urged Luo Tian, his voice filled with enticement.

“Never mind, you’ve already tricked me enough. If another trap comes up, I can’t handle it!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly.

“Master, this item is truly suitable for you. I promise I won’t trick you!” Butan Shi insisted, but Luo Tian had been too often deceived. He refused to enter the Yellow River, instead sitting on the gray long bridge.

After a while of persuasion, Butan Shi gave up.

In the following days, the Sect Heirs and Heiresses of the Ten Palaces vanished without a trace, leaving the Reincarnation Hall’s disciples puzzled.

Yet the disciples speculated in whispers—perhaps it was related to the Ten Palace Grand Tournament, as less than half a year remained until its start.

“This realm’s Reincarnation Hall is the strongest, I think. If we fail this time, there’ll be no hope at all!”

“If we succeed, obtaining two layers of hell will expand our resources significantly. It’s a major event!” The Reincarnation Hall disciples murmured, eagerly awaiting the Ten Palace Grand Tournament.

Seven days passed. Luo Tian sat on the bridge, cultivating normally. On the seventh day, a tremor rippled across the black sky, and the Black and White Officials appeared in Reincarnation Hell.

“What are you doing?” The Black and White Officials smiled, appearing before Luo Tian.

“Master, let me out! I won’t run away—I’ll stay here until after the Ten Palace Grand Tournament!” Luo Tian pleaded, bored of being stuck there.

“Dream on! I told you to reflect before the Mirror of Sins, but you’re slacking. It seems I must personally subdue you before the Mirror of Sins!” The Black and White Officials pointed their fingers, and black-and-white dragons instantly coiled around Luo Tian’s body, pinning him.

“Master, you’re playing for real! I don’t want to go near the Mirror of Sins anymore. Just let me stay here!” Luo Tian roared, but the Black and White Officials ignored him, tossing Luo Tian into the Yellow River.

“Plop…” Luo Tian fell again, trying to shout but gulping down a mouthful of Yellow River water, his face turning red.

“Kid, I didn’t give you a chance—my word is trustworthy!” The Black and White Officials smiled, then vanished into Reincarnation Hell.

“Gulp… Gulp…” Luo Tian drank a few sips of Yellow River water, then held his breath, sinking deeper into the river.

“What grudge do I have? What enmity?” Luo Tian’s heart seethed with anger, watching the flowing Yellow River. Souls drifted past him, and he felt a deep sigh.

After about an hour, Luo Tian finally saw flashes of light. He reached the riverbed, where a yellow glow emanated from beneath, illuminating his eyes.

A massive figure lay beside the yellow copper mirror—Ming Gui, with Fu Xingxuan seated upon its back. Her eyes were closed, obviously in seclusion.

Seeing Luo Tian descend, Ming Gui opened its eyes briefly, gazed at him, then closed them again without further attention.

“Hello…” Luo Tian greeted Ming Gui, his face bitter as he landed on the massive eight-cornered copper mirror.

“Buzz…” Upon touching the mirror, a wave of purification energy enveloped Luo Tian, making him grimace. The sensation of Reincarnation Hell formed on his body.

“Master, you still don’t want it? This broken mirror is the fragment that fell from me!” Butan Shi’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“What!” Upon hearing this, Luo Tian’s spirit trembled, his eyes wide with disbelief.

“Why didn’t you say earlier? It’s the Mirror of Sins! I want it—of course, I do! But how?” Luo Tian quickly replied.

“It’s a bit difficult. As long as my great Butan Shi is here, it’s no problem. It’s just a fragment of mine—how could I not handle it? If I can’t, I might as well quit!” Butan Shi scoffed. Then a fiery red stone appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, radiating intense heat.

“Buzz…” Upon Butan Shi’s appearance, the Mirror of Sins emitted a buzzing sound, its light flickering.

Chapter 2173: Dead Loop

“Hey, are you still resisting me? Let me show you!” Butan Shi glared at the Mirror of Sins’ flickering light, hopping around angrily.

“Boom… Boom…” The red stone hovered and gradually expanded.

“Ten zhang… Hundred zhang…” In an instant, Butan Shi grew to a hundred zhang in size and pressed down on the equally massive Mirror of Sins.

Luo Tian had never seen Butan Shi in such a state—this red stone exuded authority. The massive stone stirred the Yellow River water, causing gray souls to howl.

“Crack…” Next moment, Butan Shi collided with the Mirror of Sins. Though in the Yellow River, Luo Tian still felt a thunderous impact.

Nearby, Ming Gui’s body emitted divine patterns, wrapping Fu Xingxuan in a protective aura. Its eyes widened as it gazed at the red giant stone.

A crisp sound echoed, and the Yellow River violently churned. A crack appeared on the Mirror of Sins’ surface beneath the red stone.

“Master, let’s go! This time I definitely won’t trick you!” Butan Shi boasted, and another wave of energy struck Luo Tian.

“Fine, I’ll trust you once more!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and nodded, then let the energy envelop him. His body reappeared on the red earth, while Butan Shi’s form dissolved from the mirror’s surface as if nothing had happened.

In a dim yellow space, Luo Tian stood beneath it, his gaze scanning the surroundings with contemplation.

“Master, I’ll go subdue that artifact spirit first; then you can claim this Mirror of Sins!” Butan Shi transmitted, then fell silent.

“Buzz…” Soon after Butan Shi left, waves of energy rose before Luo Tian. A figure in yellow robes appeared opposite him, face cold, back bearing a large sword—its appearance identical to Luo Tian’s.

“One… Two…” Ten figures of Luo Tian stood before him, eyes cold and staring.

Luo Tian felt an ominous premonition as he shouted into the void: “Butan Shi, you bastard—again tricking me?”

“Master, I didn’t! This fragment that fell from my body created an artifact spirit. I need to subdue it and let my consciousness enter the mirror!”

“These figures are your reflections, matching your strength. Just delay a bit! Or kill these ten and you’ll become the mirror’s master! Right now, I can only do this much!” Butan Shi explained, then fell silent.

“Controlling nonsense!” Luo Tian gazed at the ten figures—this was impossible to fight. Killing ten of himself, no one could manage it.

“Kill…” As Luo Tian was bewildered, the ten figures moved. They immediately drew their black swords and attacked. Though not real, their aura was terrifying.

“Buzz… Buzz…” The sound of slicing through space echoed in Luo Tian’s ears as ten black swords slashed toward him, moving in unison. Luo Tian’s lips twitched.

“Buzz…” Longyan was drawn, and he blocked the descending swords. The collision echoed in the empty space.

“Crack… Crack…” Ten swords fell one after another, clashing with Longyan in Luo Tian’s hand. Each strike made his body tremble, and he spat blood.

“No way to fight!” Luo Tian roared, repelling the ten swords and retreating. But as he took a step back, the ten figures of Luo Tian pressed forward, slashing at him with their swords. Ten swords surrounded him without leaving any escape.

The collision echoed again, and Luo Tian had no choice but to fight back. This time was even more desperate.

“Run! I can’t beat them!” Luo Tian mentally cursed, thinking of a way to escape. He activated the Underworld Ghost Step, spitting blood as he transformed into a shadow and flew away.

As Luo Tian vanished, the ten figures rushed forward, chasing him. Their steps emitted waves of energy—apparently mastering the Underworld Ghost Step too.

“Copy? I used it once, and they could master it? This is more terrifying than the Moon Eclipse Eye!” Luo Tian mentally cursed, not stopping as he flew wildly through the vast space.

Though the space seemed large, Luo Tian could reach its end in an hour if he flew at full speed.

With ten pursuers matching his speed, Luo Tian could not turn back and had to fly forward relentlessly.

An hour passed swiftly. Luo Tian finally saw a yellow barrier blocking his path.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed, and Longyan’s divine light erupted. His body became intangible, merging with the sword to strike the nearest figure.

The buzz echoed again as ten figures raised their swords, forming a killing formation to slash at Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The black sword struck one figure, instantly slicing it into mist. Meanwhile, other figures’ attacks hit Luo Tian’s body, and blood spewed from his wounds. He was severely injured.

“Buzz…” The buzz returned, and nine swords lifted again, slashing toward Luo Tian.

“Done…!” Luo Tian mentally cursed, watching the nine swords descend. He realized he was too far behind. If it were one or two, he might have fought back, but ten was impossible for anyone to handle.

“Huff…” As if waking from a nightmare, Luo Tian opened his eyes, gazing at the surroundings. It was the Yellow River water, and beneath his feet was the Mirror of Sins.

“Boom… Boom…” A fiery red stone suddenly crushed down from above, colliding with the Mirror of Sins. The crack echoed, and a fissure appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. Ming Gui emitted divine light, wrapping Fu Xingxuan in a protective aura. Its massive eyes carried surprise.

“Master, this time I definitely won’t trick you!” Butan Shi spoke, waves of energy enveloping Luo Tian. His eyes became dazed.

“This…?” Luo Tian felt confused—wasn’t this the same situation as before? He had been killed by those figures, and even if he survived, this shouldn’t have happened.

“Master, trust me—I have a great chance!” Seeing Luo Tian unmoved, Butan Shi transmitted.

“Master, you just went in, right?” Luo Tian gazed at Butan Shi, but his words left Butan Shi confused, as if he didn’t know what Luo Tian meant.

“Master, are you going crazy? Hurry up! If I don’t do it again, it’ll hurt!” Butan Shi spoke.

“Okay!” Though confused, Luo Tian let the energy envelop him and vanished from his spot, reappearing in the yellow space.

Almost identical to before, Butan Shi vanished from Luo Tian’s perception, and ten figures surrounded him.

“Damn it—what’s going on?” Luo Tian cursed, watching the ten figures rush toward him.

“Let’s fight first!” Luo Tian sighed mentally, thinking he might have entered an illusion. He waved his hand, and the震仙笔 (Zhenxian Pen) appeared in his grasp.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian took out the Zhenxian Pen, the ten figures’ Longyan swords transformed into Zhenxian Pens and slashed toward him.

“Boom… Boom…” Luo Tian swung his Zhenxian Pen, and seven characters descended. He used the Seven Techniques of Zhenxian, now at the late stage of True Immortal. He could execute seven out of eight techniques.

The booming echoed, and Luo Tian blocked the attacks of seven figures but was struck by three Zhenxian Pens, spitting blood.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed and fled again. The scene was astonishingly similar—ten figures of Luo Tian chased him, chasing for an hour until he reached the yellow barrier again. He was struck by ten Zhenxian Pens.

“Butan Shi, you bastard—again tricking me!” Luo Tian cursed, feeling this state was related to Butan Shi.

“Boom…” Blood mist rose as Luo Tian opened his eyes again, gazing at the surroundings. Butan Shi fell from the sky, crushing down on the Mirror of Sins.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian cursed, waves of energy striking him and reappearing in the yellow space.

The cycle repeated—Luo Tian entered the yellow space repeatedly, each time killed by ten figures. The only difference was that each death varied.

Luo Tian had tried not to enter the Mirror of Sins’ yellow space but was inevitably pulled in by an invisible force. He was killed again and again.

“Can I just stay here?” Luo Tian sat with a frown, having died over thirty times.

“Dead loop!”

“This is truly a dead loop! What’s going on?” Luo Tian pondered, knowing if he continued like this, he’d never escape.

“Hard to fight against ten! I can’t fight them all!” Luo Tian muttered, his eyes bitter. He was pulled into the space again.

Chapter 2174: Movement Technique

The familiar rhythm, the familiar aura, and the familiar ending—Luo Tian reappeared in the dim world.

“Get out! Can you hurry up and kill that artifact spirit of the Mirror of Sins!” Luo Tian cursed into the void, addressing Butan Shi. Butan Shi was stunned but did not argue.

“Come out!” Luo Tian spoke, having been killed over thirty times. He knew what would happen next.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian’s words ended, ten figures appeared before him, and ten swords slashed toward him.

“There must be a point to escape this damned dead loop!”

“My task is to endure as long as possible, waiting for that point to appear!”

“My greatest advantage is infinite resurrection. These ten figures are all me, though I can’t beat them. Fighting them repeatedly will help me understand myself deeply!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with determination, thinking of a plan.

“Seven Techniques of Zhenxian!”

“Martial Step Seven!” He thought, then launched attacks. A series of martial arts were executed against the ten figures.

Finally, after relentless attacks, Luo Tian lasted an additional hour before being killed again.

“An extra hour isn’t enough?” As Luo Tian emerged, his brows furrowed, gazing at the red stone falling from the sky. The scene repeated again.

“Don’t talk nonsense—take me in!” After the booming, Luo Tian didn’t wait for Butan Shi to speak and silenced him.

“Master, what’s wrong with you? Why are you so eager?” Butan Shi asked in confusion.

“Wait—why can’t I use Butan Shi?” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened, gazing at the red stone falling from the sky.

“Maybe I’m trapped in a special environment and can’t escape. I’ve died thirty times, so I need your help!” Luo Tian spoke to Butan Shi.

“Master, are you joking? This joke isn’t funny at all!” Butan Shi chuckled nervously.

“Don’t talk nonsense! Would I joke with you here?” Luo Tian cursed.

“This time, don’t go find that artifact spirit—first help me solve this problem!” Luo Tian ordered.

“Okay!” Butan Shi quickly agreed, his voice carrying urgency.

As they spoke, Luo Tian reappeared in the space again. His gaze fell on the ten figures before him.

“Did you see?” Luo Tian spoke to Butan Shi, then took flight, evading the ten figures’ pursuit.

“Endless loop! This is an endless loop!” Butan Shi’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Hurry up—explain what this means!” Luo Tian fought back, hearing Butan Shi’s words.

“This is a method to trap people in a space, making them die endlessly and relive the same day.” Butan Shi quickly explained, fearing Luo Tian couldn’t endure.

“Who’s tricking me—yourself or the Mirror of Sins?” Luo Tian gazed at Butan Shi, voice filled with frustration.

“It’s not me—though I can’t rule out myself. If it were me, I would have tricked myself too, since now I’m just my past self, not my future!” Butan Shi’s voice carried confusion.

“How to break it?” Luo Tian spat blood, exchanging words with Butan Shi.

“One day—just survive one more day and you’ll break the dead loop!” Butan Shi replied.

“Okay!” Luo Tian nodded, not believing he couldn’t survive a day. He then glared at the ten swords approaching.

The familiar scene returned, and Luo Tian didn’t bother arguing with Butan Shi. He grabbed it and stood before the massive crack.

“I’ll wait here—just one day, I won’t survive it!” Luo Tian spoke loudly.

“Master, are you crazy? Why not go in?” Butan Shi’s voice echoed in his mind.

“Shut up! If you say another word, I’ll throw you into the latrine!” Luo Tian cursed.

Butan Shi didn’t dare to reply further, merely holding onto Luo Tian’s hand, puzzled by his strange behavior.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian sat there without running, knowing no matter where he went, the force would pull him back.

“One hour… Two hours…” Soon two hours passed, and Luo Tian still sat there. Waves finally emerged from the crack, striking him and pulling him into it.

“Only ten hours left! Ten hours is nothing…” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness, then he weighed Butan Shi in his hand.

“Now you must listen to me. I point where you strike, and if you don’t, I’ll throw you into the latrine!” Luo Tian didn’t bother arguing with Butan Shi and grabbed the Zhenxian Pen.

On his other hand, the Sun-Seeking Bow and God-Killing Arrow were drawn.

As Luo Tian just took out the Zhenxian Pen and Sun-Seeking Bow, ten familiar figures of himself appeared.

Luo Tian wielded the Zhenxian Pen to execute the Seven Techniques of Zhenxian, and the Sun-Seeking Bow was slowly drawn.

Seven characters descended toward seven figures, while the God-Killing Arrow became a streak of light, flying toward one figure.

“Subdue one!” Luo Tian shouted, addressing Butan Shi.

“Yes!” Butan Shi quickly replied and flew toward a figure not attacked, growing into an asteroid as it collided with the target.

“Buzz…”

Savage energy surged, and Luo Tian executed this, then drew Longyan to slash at the last figure.

Boom… Boom…

The collision echoed in space, golden divine light exploding one figure. Meanwhile, Butan Shi unleashed its power, shattering another.

Luo Tian’s body retreated, his eyes filled with determination. He had killed two but still faced eight left.

“Only eight!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with thought, and Butan Shi returned to his hand. He pointed it toward the remaining figures.

“Buzz…” Next moment, the remaining eight figures also raised their hands and threw toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Both Luo Tian and Butan Shi cursed, and eight red stones expanded in his vision. Then there was nothing more.

“Even Butan Shi is replicated—I can’t fight!” Luo Tian mentally cursed, but his eyes flashed with madness.

“One… Two…” In the following time, Luo Tian fell into an endless loop again but focused more, extending his endurance.

“One hour… Two hours…” Luo Tian didn’t know how time passed but kept entering the crack, fighting against the ten figures.

One day… Two days…

Before long, five months passed. The Reincarnation Hall didn’t know about the torment beneath the Yellow River water, and Fu Xingxuan remained in seclusion.

Five months passed; people no longer discussed the new Sect Heir’s whereabouts. The Eight Great Heavenly Kings’ strength was fully stabilized.

As time passed, the Reincarnation Hall’s topics changed to the Ten Palace Grand Tournament—this hell’s grand event. The Ten Palaces and Eight Great Heavenly Kings would gather.

This time, the Ten Palace Grand Tournament was held in the Reincarnation Hall, leaving one month for the disciples to prepare.

“We will definitely obtain two layers of hell this time!” All Reincarnation Hall disciples gazed with determination, for it was the strongest era of their hall.

The Ten Palace Grand Tournament consisted of three parts: Palace Master Matches, Deputy Palace Master Matches, and Younger Generation Matches.

The tournament used a points system—each palace accumulated the most points to choose two layers of hell first. The two palaces with the least points could each select one layer.

The Reincarnation Hall always finished last, so it could only choose the first layer of Reincarnation Hell.

“Ha! I thought of it! Finally, I’ve figured it out!” At the bottom of the Yellow River, Luo Tian’s eyes were bloodshot and wild, gazing at the copper mirror.

Five months—Luo Tian had died countless times. No one could endure such torment, but he persisted.

And by persisting, Luo Tian gained great benefits—deeply understanding himself. Over these five months, he had mastered every technique he possessed.

Even he learned a combination of moves, linking all his techniques together—but still couldn’t kill the ten figures.

At most, he had killed five with a burst of power but was later crushed by five figures.

“Movement techniques, concealment—these are my weaknesses. Why didn’t I focus on them!” Luo Tian mentally muttered.

“Underworld Ghost Step is clearly insufficient for me now. I must find another way, create a movement technique suited to myself. These ten figures are the best test!” Luo Tian suddenly felt that being here wasn’t a loss but a gain.

From then on, Luo Tian stopped fighting directly and instead focused on the pressure from the ten figures to refine his movement techniques.

Chapter 2175: The Ten Palace Grand Tournament Begins

One month passed quietly. The Reincarnation Hall gradually became lively, with powerful figures appearing in the sky above it. These were then guided into the hall by its disciples.

The first to arrive were the Eight Great Heavenly Kings. A middle-aged man with a smile looked at the other seven: “Everyone, it’s been a while!”

The man was Shou Gui Wang (Beast Ghost King), and the eight of them, though not participating in the Ten Palace Grand Tournament, acted as judges.

“Didn’t we just meet a few days ago?” Shou Gui Wang’s words had barely finished when a voice spoke in an unkind tone, sounding hoarse and cold.

Dressed in black robes with five-toxic patterns, he was thin and cold-eyed. The speaker was Tian Gui Wang (Heaven Ghost King) Duan Zijue, who had previously killed Luo’s family after discovering they were transferred to Shou Gui Wang.

Duan Zijue had confronted Shou Gui Wang, and they fought but neither could defeat the other.

“Enough—this isn’t a place to argue. If you want to fight, go somewhere else!” A middle-aged man with a cold face and a sword on his back glared at the Reincarnation Hall.

“Wang Tong, your son also died—heard he was killed by that Sect Heir!” Tian Gui Wang mocked after the man’s words, his eyes filled with mockery.

Yuan Gui Wang Wang Tong (Yuan Ghost King), one of the Eight Great Heavenly Kings, was also Wang Heng’s father. He had received news of Wang Heng’s death and nearly fainted.

Unlike Tian Gui Wang, who was lustful with many children, Wang Tong had only one son—Wang Heng. His death meant no descendants.

Later, Wang Tong learned of the cause of Wang Heng’s death—two possibilities: one was that he died in Reincarnation Hell, killed by the outlawed Yang Huanyu. The other was that he was killed by the new Sect Heir of Reincarnation Hall, as Duan Bao Yang’s death was an example.
