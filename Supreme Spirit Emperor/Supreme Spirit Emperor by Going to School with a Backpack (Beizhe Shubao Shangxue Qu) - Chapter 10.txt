“True Illusion?” Luotian's heart recalled these four words. On the way here, Zhang Ziping had roughly explained to Luotian the method of the Hall of Questioning the Heart. It was a trial that manifested the innermost desires of those who entered, granting them their heart's deepest wish within an illusion.

As Luotian recalled Zhang Ziping’s words, his consciousness dissolved into a realm of chaos.

“Luotian, it's time to get up and go to school!” A gentle voice rang out, awakening Luotian from his daze.

“Ah…” Luotian opened his eyes. At first, he was bewildered, then let out a soft laugh.

“Is this an illusion?” Luotian gazed at the surroundings, his face showing a hint of confusion.

“You're still dazing? Stop pretending. You came from my body, and I know you better than anyone. Don’t think this will let you skip school!” Seeing Luotian still lost in thought, the woman urged him again.

Hearing the voice, Luotian looked up and saw a woman dressed in rural attire standing before him. Though she wore simple hemp clothes, it was clear that she had once been a dignified woman.

Moments later, Luotian felt a surge of bloodline power and an indescribable sense of familiarity settle within his heart.

“Mother!” Luotian whispered, knowing this was not real.

“Little brat! Get up and go to school!” As if seeing Luotian still dazed, the woman grabbed his ear, scolding him.

Luotian's ears were pulled, and tears flowed from his eyes. He had longed for this feeling—when he was a child, he envied others whose parents beat them. Now, at last, his wish had come true.

Seeing Luotian crying, the woman quickly let go, looking at him with concern: “What's wrong? Tian'er, did I hurt you?”

“No… no!” Luotian quickly wiped his tears.

“Being strict with you is for your own good. You must study hard and become a top scholar to bring honor to father and me!” His mother, like all parents, spoke the same words.

“Hmph!” Luotian nodded firmly. Though he knew this was an illusion, he didn’t want to leave. He longed for the warmth of parental love, even if only for a day.

After eating, Luotian headed to the academy, living as an ordinary person.

In the evening, he returned home and saw his father—a simple farmer who supported their household through farming and odd jobs. Though their living conditions were poor, Luotian’s father ensured he had everything other children possessed.

Though his parents were strict, Luotian knew they sacrificed for him. This was the first time he felt parental love, and he clung to this illusion, telling himself he would break free the next day. Yet, he became addicted to this life.

Returning to ordinary existence, Luotian studied diligently. Three years later, he finally passed the entrance exam for BaiLu Academy, a renowned institution.

Though his success pleased his parents, as the enrollment date approached, a major challenge loomed in Luotian’s mind. He constantly reminded himself this was fake, but it felt too real. Over three years, he had grown dependent on the illusion of his parents—more vivid than a dream, making it hard to wake.

Ten years passed. Luotian achieved the top imperial examination rank and returned home, living as a normal person. He remained obedient before his parents, but when alone, traces of pain often flickered in his eyes.

Another ten years passed. Luotian married and had children, living a harmonious three-generation household. He had fully integrated into this life, forgetting it was an illusion—believing his past experiences were the dream.

Yet, Luotian’s inner anxieties deepened. He knew if he didn’t leave soon, he would be lost forever in this illusion.

“No! They are my parents. Even if I must leave, I will care for them until their last breath. Otherwise, a hidden demon will haunt my soul!” Luotian’s eyes gleamed with determination.

Thirty years later, Luotian resigned from his post to care for his aging parents. He didn’t know how long had passed outside, but he spent each day chatting with them. He also had grandchildren.

His parents were nearly a hundred years old, lying in bed unable to rise. Luotian tended to them tirelessly.

Neighbors marveled at how, despite his age, Luotian remained so filial.

Finally, his mother passed away, her withered hand reaching out to touch her son’s face—yet she lacked the strength.

On the day of his mother’s funeral, the entire village attended. Luotian spat blood and collapsed on his bed.

When he awoke, he saw his father standing before him, weak but alive.

“Father, how can you move?” Luotian, nearly seventy, rushed to support his father.

“Tian'er, your mother has passed. I suppose I’ll follow soon. Otherwise, I’d worry about leaving her alone in that world. Don’t think she was harsh with you as a child—after beating you, she always regretted it. She was a woman, a wife, and a mother!” His father’s eyes glowed with tenderness.

Tears streamed down Luotian’s face as he knelt before his father.

His father passed soon after their conversation, gazing ahead with no fear of death but a profound serenity and relief.

Chapter 43: Leaving the Hall of Questioning the Heart

Seeing his father’s gentle eyes, this simple farmer revealed a man's sense of duty and a different kind of paternal love.

“From the moment I entered this illusion, you are my parents. You raised me for seventy years. Whether this is real or illusory, whether I remain ordinary or become a mighty warrior, I am your son Luonantian!” Luotian’s words echoed like thunder in the small room.

Yet Luonantian seemed deaf, his eyes slowly closing, a gentle and peaceful expression on his face.

Luotian buried both parents together, ignoring others’ advice to leave this tranquil village.

Wandering alone across the continent, Luotian gazed at the world he had lived in for nearly seventy years. Though his parents were gone, his heart ached with sorrow.

Strangely, if one observed Luotian closely, he seemed younger with each step—his white hair gradually turning black.

“Sixty-eight… fifty…” He stopped when he returned to twenty years old.

“It’s time to leave, Father! Mother! Thank you for giving me a warmth I never knew. I wish we could meet again!” Luotian stood on a precipice, tears in his eyes, and leapt into the abyss.

“Ah…” Endless darkness enveloped Luotian. For the first time, he felt such coldness. In this illusion, he had lived an ordinary life, but the most unforgettable thing was his parents’ affection.

Luotian didn’t know his current age or appearance. He cared little; he only knew he had returned to the cold Hall of Questioning the Heart, leaving behind the two who raised him. He longed to sleep once more in their warm embrace.

“Though momentarily blinded, your filial piety moved heaven and earth. You pass!” A deep voice echoed in the vast darkness.

Luotian’s face showed gratitude, though he doubted its truth. Still, it had given him parental love. He bowed deeply into the darkness and left the endless Hall of Questioning the Heart, leaving behind an indelible experience.

Seeing Luotian dazedly exit, Lei Yong approached with joy. Though it took longer than expected, Luotian had finally emerged—his only fear was that Luotian might lose himself in the Hall of Questioning the Heart.

Stepping out of the Hall, warm sunlight touched his face. Luotian’s mood improved slightly. He glanced back at the three characters “Hall of Questioning the Heart,” marveling at Wuxia’s mystery and power—creating such a realistic illusion.

“Hmph… Since I’m out, I’ll continue living my life. Even on this Tianyuan Continent, I’ll still be your pride!” He sighed inwardly and greeted Gu Lei and Ji Chen.

Seeing Luotian was fine, though a bit quiet, it was reassuring he could still speak. They led him to the Dan Hall.

“He’s Luotian? The Five Elements Body?” On the main road of the Dan Hall, some outer disciples whispered about Luotian’s silence.

“Hmph. Genius always acts aloof. Wait until he enters the hall—he’ll learn a lesson. I remember a few years ago, an inner disciple walked in arrogant and came out changed,” his companion scoffed.

In the eyes of others, Lei Yong led Luotian into a grand hall.

“Junior brother, these people aren’t ordinary—they’re just stubborn. The old-timers might challenge you. Don’t act rashly; Master isn’t here, and they’re upset about letting your brother lead the Dan Hall. Try to endure if possible,” Lei Yong warned before entering.

“Hmph!” Luotian nodded slightly and said nothing more.

Entering the hall, Luotian’s eyes regained some vitality. Following Lei Yong and Ji Chen into the hall.

The hall was filled with people in Dan Hall attire—men, women, young and old. At the center sat Zhang Ziping. Seeing Luotian’s gloomy face, Zhang Ziping knew he had been affected by the Hall of Questioning the Heart.

“Spiritual awareness?” As soon as he entered, Luotian felt pressure from all sides. He laughed inwardly.

Spiritual awareness was something he understood well. His strength wasn’t in cultivation but spiritual awareness, which had been enhanced by the Book of Epochs. His spiritual awareness was unmatched among his peers.

Seeing these young people use such a foolish method to intimidate him, Luotian sneered but walked forward as if nothing had happened.

Seeing no reaction from Luotian, the young disciples’ eyes flickered with surprise. Even the elderly beside Zhang Ziping showed a hint of astonishment.

Those in the Dan Hall were top disciples, some even direct disciples of the elders. Seeing Luotian unaffected by pressure, their youthful arrogance surfaced, increasing the pressure—especially the direct disciples, who directed half their spiritual awareness toward Luotian.

Seeing they still pressured him, Luotian’s temper flared. Yet he knew entering the Dan Hall too early could cause trouble with Zhang Ziping, so he chose to ignore it.

Seeing half their spiritual awareness failed to subdue Luotian, the direct disciples felt embarrassed. Usually, arrogant disciples left humbled, but Luotian was different.

When they saw their master’s face darkening, they gritted their teeth and exerted all their strength toward Luotian.

A terrifying pressure materialized, creating a gust of wind that swept toward Luotian.

Seeing them push so relentlessly, Luotian’s anger ignited. Especially after leaving the Hall of Questioning the Heart, still grieving his parents’ loss, he coldly said: “If you want me to embarrass myself, then don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

Lei Yong saw the spiritual awareness attack Luotian and felt a chill. If Luotian was humiliated here, it would be equivalent to humiliating them all—especially Zhang Ziping, who felt ashamed.

Chapter 44: The Statue

Ji Chen was also tense, but seeing Zhang Ziping’s calm face, he felt reassured. If the elder brother wasn’t worried, it meant he knew Luotian could handle this situation.

Ji Chen relaxed, recalling that Luotian had passed the final level of the Ascending Stairs. This problem was trivial. He felt a stone fall from his heart, leaving only Lei Yong sweating anxiously, which made Ji Chen smile.

“Buzz…” Luotian stopped defending and sent out parts of his spiritual awareness to counter the attacks.

Though divided, his spiritual awareness was far stronger than those of the elders’ direct disciples.

These spiritual attacks seemed like a blade against a tree compared to Luotian’s.

A gust of wind swept around Luotian, blowing his robes. After repelling the attacks, he didn’t stop but charged forward.

“Plop…” Several thuds echoed as the direct disciples fell, staring at Luotian in shock. They couldn’t believe this young man was not only strong but also had such an abnormal spiritual awareness. Was he even human?

Their faces turned red, feeling their humiliation. They had been completely dominated by a peer.

The elders seated before Zhang Ziping were also shocked. This Luotian was too unexpected. They had hoped to curb Zhang Ziping’s confidence, but this young man had slapped their faces.

Gu Lei was also excited, almost shouting “Good!” but stopped himself. His excitement showed to the Dan Hall disciples.

Zhang Ziping smiled at Luotian, admiration in his eyes. Though unsure of the outcome, he trusted his master’s judgment and believed any of them could handle such a situation.

“Disciple Luotian greets the acting hall master and all elders!” Luotian’s voice interrupted their shock, drawing attention back to him.

“Hmph. No need for formalities. Luotian, this is your first time in the Dan Hall; you don’t know much yet. Follow me to take an oath. Though Master isn’t here, I can still teach you some things,” Zhang Ziping said, as he was the acting hall master.

The elders exchanged glances and focused on an elderly man seated before Zhang Ziping.

“Master, according to the Dan Hall rules, all disciples with fire attribute must become alchemists. This was set by the old master; I assume you haven’t forgotten?” The elderly man’s lips twitched as he addressed Zhang Ziping.

“Hmph. That is a problem. But Master isn’t here to teach him alchemy. We’ll discuss it when he returns,” Zhang Ziping frowned.

Though annoyed by the interruption, the man was a senior elder. He cited rules and Master’s name; even Zhang Ziping couldn’t change it. The Dan Hall needed rules to avoid chaos.

“Senior Lu Kunpeng, I’ve noticed Luotian’s strong spiritual awareness. I feel a desire to teach him temporarily instead of the old master. Please grant me this favor,” the elder said.

“Hmph…” Zhang Ziping hesitated, not wanting Luotian to follow this elder. It wasn’t that Lu Kunpeng was a villain, but the elders resented letting an alchemist-less person lead. It was just their pride in alchemy, not targeting Zhang Ziping.

“Disciple Luotian is willing to follow the elder’s teachings,” Luotian said.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng, Luotian felt a stir. This elder was definitely an alchemy master—far beyond his half-baked skills. He relied on spiritual awareness for alchemy, and his techniques were inferior to Gu Qianxue’s. Hearing Lu Kunpeng offered to teach him, though he knew his motives weren’t pure, he agreed.

Hearing Luotian’s agreement, Zhang Ziping glanced at him and accepted. It was Luotian’s choice; he couldn’t interfere.

Soon, the elders all departed, including Gu Lei and Ji Chen. Only Luotian and Zhang Ziping remained.

“Follow me,” Zhang Ziping didn’t ask why Luotian wanted to follow the elder but simply told him to follow.

Not long after, they arrived at a simple courtyard.

The courtyard was ordinary, with wooden gates and walls. Yet it was orderly, clearly well-maintained.

Zhang Ziping approached the wooden gate and, for the first time, showed respect on his usually calm face.

Luotian noticed this rare expression. Zhang Ziping had never shown such respect even when meeting the Five Elements Sect’s leader, Wei Mingxuan. Luotian knew this courtyard was the mysterious master’s residence.

Zhang Ziping opened the gate and led Luotian to a thatched hut: “Enter. After seeing the statue, kneel and bow three times. From now on, you are my third younger brother, Zhang Ziping!”

Luotian’s eyes narrowed as he stepped into the hut.

As soon as he entered, he was shocked. The interior vastly differed from its exterior.

It had a large space with rooms like bedrooms and alchemy halls. The centerpiece was an anthropomorphic statue.

The statue depicted an old man with a hand on his beard, gazing ahead—exactly like the image Zhang Ziping had shown.

To Luotian’s surprise, no matter how he moved, the statue's eyes seemed to watch him. He marveled at the sculptor’s skill.

Luotian knew this was the statue Zhang Ziping mentioned—the mysterious master. He approached the statue, where a cushion lay before it.

Chapter 45: Initiation

“Regardless of your reasons for taking me as a disciple, you deserve my three bows. Without your help, I might have died in Tianyuan City at Li Xiuping’s hands! I value gratitude!” Luotian knelt, speaking to the statue.

“This first bow is for saving me in Tianyuan City!” Luotian bowed, his head hitting the ground with a dull thud. This bow wasn’t protected by cultivation; he truly bowed, his forehead showing a deep purple mark from the force.

At that moment, the jade pendant on Luotian’s waist glowed softly, covering his forehead with a green light. Under the wood-element energy healing, the purple mark vanished.

Luotian glanced at the pendant: “This second bow is for giving me this jade, hiding my aura in Xuantian City and saving my brothers’ lives!”

“Thud…” Another clear thud echoed.

The statue seemed to gain life. The energy from Five Elements Mountain surged into the thatched hut.

Zhang Ziping stood outside, his eyes wide with shock. He didn’t know what had happened to cause such a thinning of energy.

Yet Luotian seemed unaffected.

“Crackling Spear!” Luotian whispered, and the spear appeared before him.

He raised both hands: “This third bow is for letting me ascend Five Elements Mountain and obtain the Crackling Spear. I also bow to my disciples Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen for protecting me and saving my life!”

“Thud…” The third thudding sound echoed.

“Ugh…” Energy surged, flowing into the statue. Soon, the statue’s eyes glowed green, shining on Luotian’s jade pendant.

“Finally met you!” A voice with an aged tone echoed.

As the old voice spoke, a faint figure emerged from the jade pendant, carrying an aged aura.

The old man stood casually before Luotian but seemed like a mountain to him. He felt like an ant under the sky, certain this old man wasn’t in the Soul-Transcending Realm.

The old man pointed a finger, and all the energy from Five Elements Sect seemed to vanish, gathering into this unassuming courtyard.

“What’s happening? Why is the energy so thin?” Wei Mingxuan and other peak leaders felt the thinning energy, looking toward its source.

“It’s the Dan Hall! Did a senior elder break through? No! Even breaking into Soul-Transcending wouldn’t cause such a large-scale thinning!” People marveled at the Dan Hall, confused.

As energy surged, the old man seemed to absorb it endlessly. His faint figure grew more solid.

Not long after, the old man finally stopped, revealing a real elder before Luotian.

Luotian couldn’t believe his eyes. He could not guess the old man’s cultivation, as it exceeded his comprehension.

“Don’t be surprised. This is just my spiritual body! It won’t last long!” The old man saw Luotian’s shock and explained.

“Alright, ask your questions quickly. Remember my name is Zhang Daotian!” The old man said, his face showing a nostalgic expression, as if he hadn’t mentioned it in ages.

“Why did you take me as a disciple?” Luotian asked directly.

“Why? Well, tell me—Book of Epochs! Is it still useful?” Zhang Daotian smiled gently at Luotian.

“Boom…” A tidal wave of emotions surged in Luotian. He never expected his greatest secret—his Book of Epochs—to be known by his master. He had concealed it well, never letting anyone discover it. How did this old man know?

“Don’t be surprised or afraid. If I wanted to harm you, would you have lived until now? I’ve been observing your every move since you obtained the Book of Epochs!” Zhang Daotian said calmly.

“Why?” Luotian became more puzzled. He didn’t believe anyone could remain indifferent to the Book of Epochs. Though his master seemed to know it better than him, he couldn’t believe he was unaffected.

“Remember not to show anyone you have the Book of Epochs, even those closest to you. Otherwise, it will bring great calamity upon you and your family. Even I might not be able to save you then.”

“Then, aren’t you interested in the Book of Epochs?” Luotian asked boldly.

“Book of Epochs! Book of Epochs!” Zhang Daotian’s eyes showed a painful expression, his hands pulling with intense force.

“Ugh…” Luotian’s mind trembled. The Book of Epochs seemed to break free from his mind, flying toward Zhang Daotian.

The old man’s aged hands gently caressed the Book of Epochs, his calm gaze revealing intense hatred.

Luotian could only watch as the Book of Epochs left his mind. At this moment, he couldn’t guess Zhang Daotian’s cultivation—knowing even all the Soul-Transcending Realm masters he had seen would be insufficient to fight him. And this was just a spiritual body! How strong was his true self? Luotian couldn’t imagine.

Zhang Daotian extended a finger, continuously carving on the Book of Epochs. Luotian felt waves constantly emanating from his fingers, though not very powerful. Yet he sensed the carved elements were extraordinary.

After some time, Luotian noticed sweat on Zhang Daotian’s face. What could make such a strong person sweat?

“Seal…” Finally, a deep roar echoed as Zhang Daotian shouted with intense focus.

A sealing aura spread, pushing Luotian back several feet. He felt difficulty breathing under this aura.

“Done!” Zhang Daotian panted, his eyes showing joy. The carving had consumed much of his spiritual body’s energy, but success made him happy.

“This way, no one will discover it!” Zhang Daotian sent the Book of Epochs back to Luotian’s mind, which glowed with golden light.

“Hmph!” Luotian didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t fathom Zhang Daotian’s intentions, even after becoming his disciple. Yet the master returned it without hesitation. This left Luotian feeling uneasy.

“Don’t say much. I’ve used up most of my spiritual body’s energy. As your master, don’t doubt my intentions. I do this only because you are my disciple! Master Zhang Daotian doesn’t need to take his disciples’ belongings!” Zhang Daotian said, confidence radiating from his aged body.

Chapter 46: The Brushing Technique

At this moment, Luotian fully understood his master was a straightforward and upright person. No wonder Zhang Ziping held him in such high regard.

Luotian knelt again: “Disciple Luotian greets my master!”

This bow was truly his initiation. At this moment, he accepted Zhang Daotian’s existence from the heart.

Seeing Luotian bow again, Zhang Daotian smiled warmly: “You have the Book of Epochs. I can’t teach you much in cultivation, and your martial arts are sufficient for now. Learning too many techniques would make them scattered. I can only teach you alchemy.”

When Zhang Daotian mentioned alchemy, his eyes showed confidence. He extended a hand, and the furnace and herbs from Luotian’s storage bag flew out.

“Thousand-Page Brushing Technique! I created this alchemy method. It requires great proficiency to master, and it’s your goal for the next year!” Zhang Daotian said. His hands moved swiftly, forming various hand shapes before Luotian’s eyes. Even with his spiritual awareness spread out, he couldn’t keep up.

Yet before Luotian could react, a fragrance of herbs filled the air.

“Ordinary people usually use spiritual awareness to classify and refine herbs. Though it’s convenient, it lacks the physical sensation. Like how you now smell the herb fragrance but don’t know its taste, only by experiencing it can you grasp how long to refine and the fire’s intensity!” Zhang Daotian’s voice echoed again.

Luotian felt a stir in his heart, recalling his time in Tianyuan City and Xuantian City. Gu Yun and Gu Qianxue’s alchemy techniques were extremely skilled, using their hands to place herbs into the furnace instead of spiritual awareness like himself.

“Master’s Thousand-Page Brushing Technique relies on one’s hands, distinguishing subtle differences in herbs through touch!” Zhang Daotian said proudly. He pointed a finger.

A series of images appeared in Luotian’s mind—methods to master the Thousand-Page Brushing Technique. These methods left Luotian in awe, and his respect for Zhang Daotian deepened.

“Alright. My time is limited. Remember not to let anyone know you have the Book of Epochs; otherwise, the consequences would be catastrophic! This storage ring is a gift I prepared for you. It contains some of my insights—hope they help you in the Dan Hall. Listen to your elder brother, he’s the one I value most. His character makes me feel at ease!” Zhang Daotian said, then added a few more words. His figure grew dim.

“Do you know when I’ll see your true form?” Luotian knelt again, gazing at Zhang Daotian’s dimming figure.

“Wait until you reach the Soul-Transcending Realm. I’ll give you a great gift then! We’ll meet, but for now, I have other things to do and can’t stay,” Zhang Daotian said. His figure finally vanished.

Luotian watched his master’s form disappear, and a ring fell from the statue’s hand onto the ground before him.

Luotian gazed at the statue, feeling his master was hiding something. Was it because he was too weak?

Luotian chuckled self-deprecatingly. Indeed, he was just a body cultivation level six person. Even his elder brother in the Soul-Transcending Realm couldn’t help, let alone himself.

Yet soon, Luotian’s eyes gleamed: “Master, since I am your disciple, I will help you. If bone-removing isn’t enough, then Soul-Transcending; if that’s not enough, then soul-sacrificing!”

Luotian put the ring on his hand and bowed again to the statue. Then he opened the door, seeing Zhang Ziping waiting.

“Elder Brother!” Luotian’s eyes showed a smile. From now on, he had three elder brothers.

“Junior Brother!” A junior brother’s greeting signified Zhang Ziping’s approval.

A sense of understanding formed between them. They exchanged glances, and everything was said without words. After bowing to the hut’s door, they left the courtyard.

As they walked away, the courtyard returned to its quiet state. The statue still stood in the center, gazing into the distance as if watching Luotian and Zhang Ziping leave.

Luotian and Zhang Ziping walked for a while before parting. He had promised to follow the Dan Hall’s senior elder to learn alchemy, and he felt a growing curiosity.

“Dan Hall, I’m coming!” He muttered, heading toward the senior elder’s courtyard.

“Disciple Luotian greets the senior elder!” He called into the courtyard.

“I’ve been waiting for you. Come in,” a young figure emerged from the courtyard, eyes filled with provocation.

Luotian smiled upon seeing him. This young man was one of those he had pressured with spiritual awareness in the Five Elements Sect’s hall. He hadn’t expected this young man to be the senior elder’s disciple.

Seeing the young man’s hostile gaze, Luotian smiled indifferently. He had lived through decades in the illusion, his mind far more mature than peers. He knew what this young man was thinking and chose not to argue.

Luotian followed the young man into a room. Senior Elder Lu Kunpeng sat on a chair, reading a book as if ignoring Luotian’s presence.

Seeing the elder ignored him, Luotian stood calmly to the side with respect.

The young disciple also stood by, accustomed to waiting for Lu Kunpeng to finish reading.

“One hour… two hours!” Lu Kunpeng continued reading, ignoring Luotian’s presence.

The young disciple was surprised by Luotian’s calmness. He remembered himself being impatient after one hour, but Luotian remained composed for two hours.

“Temperament?” Luotian smirked inwardly. He had lived through decades in the illusion, his temperament as mature as an old man’s. Not just two hours—more would be fine.

“Take it. Memorize within three days. Return to me then; I’ll personally test you!” Lu Kunpeng calmly handed the book to Luotian.

“Yes,” Luotian flipped through the book, initially bewildered before answering softly.
