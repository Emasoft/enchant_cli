However, Luotian soon felt a surge of joy: "I've arrived here, and after so long with no incidents, and I haven't seen any ferocious beasts. That must mean the person isn't hostile towards me. If they were, I wouldn't have a chance to survive!"

After understanding this, Luotian's face displayed a hint of confidence. If this person didn't seek trouble with him, then in the Refining Body Stage, where Da'an Forest had already been left behind by others, his competitors would be fewer. At least, no one among humans was now his match.

Not only did Luotian realize this, but the other disciples of the Five Elements Sect also recognized it. They were aware of Luotian's terrifying combat power, and even figures like Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun were far from his level.

The group, faces lit with joy, continued forward. They eventually encountered a pack of ferocious beasts, but those creatures seemed to ignore Luotian entirely, slowly walking past them.

This situation left everyone astonished. Luotian was also puzzled, suspecting it might relate to the Ji Yuan Book.

Unconsciously, their courage grew. The group that had previously lagged behind gradually became the fastest.

This phenomenon of Luotian being ignored by ferocious beasts was noticed by someone—his adopted nephew, Wang Tianxiang.

At first, Wang Tianxiang hadn't noticed anything. However, later when he saw Luotian overtake him, he chose to follow Luotian and walked a while before realizing the strange nature of Luotian's group. He then stubbornly trailed behind Luotian.

As Wang Tianxiang's group joined, more people noticed the strange nature of this group. Not only was it large, but no ferocious beasts had dared to provoke them.

This led more people to shamelessly follow Luotian's group, which angered some disciples of the Five Elements Sect.

Luotian looked at this long line of leeches with a helpless smile, but he didn't stop them. After all, it was good to have people indebted to him.

Luotian had also tried approaching areas with terrifying qi, but nothing changed.

Even daringly, he touched a sleeping tiger-shaped ferocious beast. Under the terrified gazes of those following him, the tiger's red tongue licked his palm, as if seeking favor.

This scene left people speechless, marveling at why this happened. Especially those who had suffered injuries from ferocious beasts before felt deep resentment.

As Luotian continued testing, they eventually reached a vast area. The dense canopy was gone, but the ground was covered with lush medicinal herbs.

The herbs radiated a thick aura of vitality, making people feel refreshed.

Luotian gazed at this boundless expanse resembling a medicinal herb garden, his face showing awe. This was the most astonishing sight of herbs he had ever seen in his life.

Soon, someone could no longer contain their greed and rushed into the herb garden with wild excitement.

Upon one person entering, others feared being outdone and rushed into the herb garden as well.

Luotian furrowed his brows, grabbing the Five Elements Sect disciples and Wang Tianxiang who were about to run into the herb garden, whispering: "Wait a bit!"

Those who had always revered Luotian obeyed his command, no longer advancing but standing with him outside the herb garden to watch the crowd.

"Strange... why does it feel odd, yet no one has changed?" Luotian observed the people pulling herbs from the garden, puzzled.

"It's impossible! It can't be so easy for us to collect herbs. There must be a trick!" Luotian shouted lowly, his eyes fixed on the people pulling herbs.

His spiritual awareness surged like a tide toward the crowd in the herb garden, and he was stunned.

"An illusion!" Luotian discovered through his spiritual awareness that these people were already tightly bound by vines, their faces showing greed.

"Wait... why do I see the same image of them collecting herbs? Does that mean we are also in this illusion? When did we enter it? If it was from the moment we entered Da'an Forest, that would be terrifying!" Luotian's mind surged with waves.

"When exactly did this happen?" Luotian instinctively glanced around, including Dong San Si, and became vigilant. He couldn't confirm whether the current Dong San Si was an illusion or a real one.

Luotian was shocked. He had entered illusions before, like during the Five Elements Sect's recruitment in the Heart-Testing Hall. He knew how terrifying illusions could be—feeling no sense of unreality at all.

But this situation was completely different from the Heart-Testing Hall. In this dangerous Da'an Forest, he had fallen into an illusion.

The one thing Luotian could confirm was that his current space was definitely within an illusion.

"Hey, Luotian," Dong San Si's voice rang out, interrupting Luotian's thoughts.

"Nothing!" Luotian didn't know if Dong San Si was real or an illusion, so he said nothing more. He stared oddly at the people collecting herbs, even though he knew they were illusions and that the real people had been bound by vines.

"How do we break it?" Luotian's heart raced, unsure how to deal with the situation. His mind felt chaotic.

"Ha... ha..." A series of laughter like silver bells echoed in Luotian's ears.

A black giant tiger emerged from the other side of the herb garden, and people were astonished to see a boy wearing a red diaper sitting on its back. The boy continuously pulled the tiger's fur, muttering something in a childish voice.

"Ugly uncle! You didn't take Longbao to play!" The boy's high-pitched voice rang out.

The black tiger beneath him showed a look of helplessness and pain, slowly approaching the herb garden.

A fifteen-foot-long tiger walking toward them was impossible to miss. The people grabbing herbs and those behind Luotian all watched cautiously as the black tiger approached.

Chapter 132: Baby's Displeasure

Though people didn't sense any qi fluctuations from this man and tiger, they felt their unusual nature. Especially the black tiger's massive body was intimidating.

"Hey! There's someone there!" The boy pointed at Luotian's group and shouted.

The black tiger clearly understood the boy's words, its cold gaze turning toward Luotian's group.

"Roar..." A roaring sound echoed, a king-like aura radiating from the black tiger.

"Ugly uncle! Roar what for? You scared baby!" The boy on the tiger's back, hearing this roar, grabbed the tiger's fur again with his tiny hands. A gust of wind blew past, scattering the black tiger's fur.

"Awoooo..." Unlike the previous king-like aura, this time the tiger howled mournfully, but its eyes held a hint of affection. The sound dropped significantly.

"Hmph! From now on, you are my Longbao's slaves. You can call me Master Longbao!" The boy stood up on the tiger's back, waving his hand with a commanding voice.

The crowd hearing the boy's words laughed lightly. Being enslaved by such a small child made them feel ridiculous.

Longbao apparently sensed their mockery, his face showing dissatisfaction. "What? Are you not satisfied with becoming my great Longbao's slave?"

"Ha!" The boy's cuteness made even Dong San Si and others behind Luotian laugh.

Only Luotian smiled lightly, his face serious as he analyzed whether the situation was real or an illusion.

"Child, go away quickly and don't disturb us collecting herbs!" A disciple smiled at the boy.

"You're picking my herbs? Those are all mine! They're my snacks. You dare steal my snacks? Baby's unhappy, you'll get into big trouble!" The boy looked at the herbs in their hands and shouted angrily.

"Roar..." The black tiger's eyes showed a hint of affection, roaring at the crowd.

This mountain-shaking roar made people shocked. Dong San Si and others turned pale, their mouths bleeding.

Luotian's head rang with a humming sound, his face showing disbelief. This pressure was one he had seen before—purely the aura of the Yuanling Stage. And this tiger naturally carried a king-like aura, making the pressure even more oppressive.

"Human! Being noticed by my nephew is your fortune. You still dare to resist?" The black tiger spoke coldly.

"Wow, this beast can talk!" Luotian's heart trembled. He had never seen a ferocious beast speak before.

"This beast is definitely Yuanling Stage, and stronger than the sect masters of Feiyun Sect. As Luotian evaluated this black tiger, others were all pressed to the ground by this pressure.

Luotian restrained his urge to kneel, his cultivation activated, his face flushed as he stared at the black tiger.

"Hey?" The boy noticed everyone had fallen to the ground except Luotian, as if discovering something new. He jumped off the tiger and bounced toward Luotian.

"You're interesting!" The boy pointed at Luotian, crossing his arms and mimicking an adult's posture.

The boy's appearance was comical—only reaching Luotian's hips, continuously circling around him at a fast pace.

Luotian, already dazed from the pressure, felt even more dizzy with this small creature's movement.

The boy finally stopped, his eyes showing a mischievous glint. He kicked the ground and leaped high into the air, landing stably on Luotian's back with his tiny body.

"Smack..." This impact wasn't serious, but Luotian's straight legs bent slightly, one leg deeply embedded in the ground.

Luotian felt as if hit by a mountain. If his body strength wasn't extraordinary, this impact would have shattered his flesh and bone.

Even so, Luotian's strong body had tiny cracks, with a creaking sound from his bones.

First the tiger's pressure, then this boy's weight—Luotian felt as if his body wasn't his own. He knew that even a single breath would result in being crushed by this man and tiger.

The black tiger, seeing Luotian could withstand the boy's weight, his dark eyes showed shock. He carried this boy every day and knew how heavy it was. This wasn't something a mere Refining Body Stage cultivator could endure.

The boy, seeing Luotian hadn't been crushed, showed a defiant look as if challenged. He jumped into the air again.

Seeing this, Luotian smiled bitterly. If he endured another impact like that, even if he didn't die, he'd lose a layer of skin. He quickly took out a pill from his storage ring.

Though it wasn't a high-quality pill, the fragrance of seven layers of wood and grass was清香. He held it high, releasing a fragrant aroma from his hand.

The boy hovered in the air, sniffing his nose, his plump face showing a dreamy expression. He immediately flew to Luotian's front and snatched the pill from his hand, lovingly drooling.

People watching the boy's drool felt trembling. They didn't understand how a small child could produce so much saliva, and his heavy body had pressed Luotian into the ground.

"This sugar seems really good. It's much better than what my father used to give me!" The boy put the pill into his mouth, then looked at Luotian again.

"You have any more? Baby's happy and decided not to make you a slave!" The boy walked up to Luotian, patting his thigh.

"No more, this is the only one. If you want more, use these herbs to make it!" Luotian smiled slightly.

At this moment, he had realized the environment was fake, but the people were real—meaning the boy and tiger were genuine!

Because he could contact Dong San Si through his pill jade tablet, and Dong San Si had answered him. Luotian didn't believe even the strongest illusion-maker could surpass his master. His master's creations were definitely trustworthy.

But Luotian couldn't guess where this man and tiger came from.

Chapter 133: Refining, Refining, Refining

"Ah... as long as there are these herbs and fruits, can you make sugar?" The boy asked with a naive expression, showing no trace of his previous fierceness.

"Of course!" Luotian pulled his leg out of the ground, smiling kindly.

"Tiger Uncle! Bring me my usual snacks, they're too bad. This one is much better!" The boy said to the black tiger beside him.

The black tiger heard the boy's words and showed a gentle expression, extending its massive tiger paw. Two golden fruits appeared, radiating thick vitality.

The boy bounced over to the tiger's paw and took one, handing it to Luotian.

He held another in his small hand, showing his tiger teeth and started eating it, saying while chewing: "This is my favorite fruit. It's much better than other herbs and fruits!"

Luotian looked at the black tiger, who hadn't taken any herbs from the garden but had produced them from somewhere. This made him more certain that the environment was fake, so he turned his gaze to the golden fruit in the boy's hand.

"Jiao Long Tian Yuan Fruit!" A disciple from the Five Elements Sect exclaimed, eyes burning with desire.

Luotian also showed surprise at this Jiao Long Tian Yuan Fruit.

"Jiao Long Tian Yuan Fruit, golden in color, blooming once every ten thousand years and bearing fruit once every ten thousand years. It grows where Jiao Long resides, being the favorite food of Jiao Long. Its main effect is to allow Jiao Long to undergo an ordeal and transform into a dragon!" Luotian recalled the effects of this fruit, his expression filled with awe.

What shocked him more was that such a precious fruit could be casually produced by this boy, as if it were a snack. How dense the spiritual energy was! This boy could withstand it—was his body ironclad? Even an ironclad body would struggle with this medicinal power.

While marveling, Luotian took the Jiao Long Tian Yuan Fruit from the boy's hand and resisted the urge to keep it, beginning to refine this fruit.

Though reluctant, he refined it into a third-grade pill with seven layers of wood and grass energy. It wasn't that he didn't want to refine it higher; it was just too difficult. With his current cultivation, refining this rare Jiao Long Tian Yuan Fruit into a medicinal liquid would take a long time.

If Lu Kunpeng saw Luotian using such rare treasures to refine only a third-grade pill, he would definitely slap Luotian and scold him for being wasteful.

Others watching the third-grade pill refined by Luotian had twitching mouths but helplessly accepted it. Only Luotian could refine pills, and his refining skills were renowned even in the Pill Hall.

Under Longbao's drooling gaze, Luotian's pill was finally completed. Two fragrant pills were given to Longbao.

Longbao swallowed his drool and put the pill into his mouth, chewing it with a satisfied expression.

The black tiger's gaze toward Luotian changed slightly, as if considering whether to kidnap him and have him serve Longbao.

Under the shocked gazes of everyone, Longbao finished eating the two third-grade pills with seven layers of wood and grass energy as if they were candy.

He patted his stomach, belching: "Tiger Uncle, bring out all my snacks. I want more!"

The black tiger heard the boy's words and didn't say a word, extending its massive paw. A mountain of herbs and medicinal plants piled up in front of everyone.

"This..." Luotian was shocked, his face showing awe at the mountain of herbs before him.

Others were also stunned by this scene. These herbs, each one a rare treasure, were now being thrown like trash before their eyes.

"Chi Huo Yuan Shen... Jin Yan Zhi..." Luotian recited the names of these herbs, drooling.

Luotian's reaction was understandable; others also showed intense greed on their faces, drooling from their mouths.

"This is mine! You, turn all of these into the candy I made before!" Longbao's childish voice interrupted their daze.

Luotian was excited, certain that the herbs he needed to help Tianbo refine his body-building pills were definitely here. And it wasn't just one or two herbs.

"Quickly, quickly!" Longbao extended his small hand and tugged at Luotian's sleeve.

"Uh..." Hearing Longbao's words, Luotian thought about what the boy asked and felt his head ache.

With so many herbs, even if he didn't rest, refining them for a month would still be impossible.

But now, being under someone's roof, he had no choice but to comply. Seeing the black tiger's fierce gaze, Luotian sighed and began refining.

Luotian sorted these herbs with excitement, realizing that the few herbs needed for Tianbo's body-building pills were among this mountain of herbs.

The sound of explosions kept echoing in the herb garden, and under people's respectful gazes, Luotian continuously refined pills.

Even the black tiger's gaze toward Luotian gradually changed. Luotian's thousand-page拂丹 hand was too mysterious. Though the black tiger was comparable to a Yuanling peak beast, it had long roamed in Da'an Forest and rarely went outside. It knew of the existence of alchemists but had never seen a real one.

"Ugh... I can't do it anymore!" After several hours, Luotian's face was pale and he collapsed on the ground, his qi exhausted. Even his spiritual awareness was drained completely, leaving him too weak to stand up.

Twenty furnaces of pills were successfully refined, seventeen of which were seven layers of wood and grass energy. In such a short time, achieving this result was enough for Luotian to be proud of his refining skills.

People around him stared at Luotian in shock. They had known Luotian's alchemical skills were amazing, but they hadn't seen him refine pills before. Now, seeing Luotian lying on the ground unable to get up, they showed admiration.

Dong San Si had seen Luotian refine pills before. Now seeing him complete seventeen furnaces of pills in just a few hours, he knew Luotian's alchemical skills had improved further.

Longbao, with a childish face, smiled and ran over to the ground, having the black tiger collect the seventeen vials. He was afraid someone would steal them.

Chapter 134: Friend

After the black tiger collected the vials on the ground, Longbao walked up to Luotian and looked at him lying on the ground. His face showed a hint of pity.

"How are you?" Longbao asked innocently.

Luotian, seeing Longbao's innocent expression, felt his resentment subside unconsciously. He smiled weakly: "I'm out of strength. Let me rest!"

"Ah, are you tired?" Longbao's face showed guilt and lifted Luotian up. He ran toward the herb pile, continuously searching for something.

"Strange... why can't I find it?" He muttered and sighed, returning to Luotian's side.

"It's okay!" Luotian smiled lightly. He had started to like this terrifying yet innocent boy.

"Ah! I found it!" Longbao seemed to remember something and happily turned around, approaching Luotian. He took Luotian's hand.

Under the confused gazes of those around him, Longbao's childish hand placed itself on Luotian's palm.

But as soon as Longbao's hand touched, Luotian felt a violent surge of qi entering his body. This feeling was somewhat familiar.

"Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pill!" Luotian recalled the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pill he had refined in Tianyuan City, which contained a drop of true dragon essence. That had almost cost him his life.

Now, the violent qi in his body was not just hundreds or thousands times stronger than that drop of dragon essence.

But now, Luotian was no longer the small Refining Body Stage Luo Tian from before. He had reached the ninth stage of Refining Body, and his experience and cultivation were far beyond what he had before. Plus, this dragon qi was controlled by Longbao.

"Roar!" The qi entered his body with a series of roars, circulating through Luotian's body. His dry meridians became replenished with vitality again.

Luotian quickly activated the Five Elements Qi Transformation Technique to refine this dragon qi. He knew this might be an opportunity, and he felt that the dragon qi within his body met with the dragon qi Longbao had sent into him, like a king meeting its subject. It was as docile as a kitten.

Longbao withdrew his hand, looking satisfied and muttering: "This should be okay!"

The black tiger saw Longbao's actions. His massive tiger head looked at Luotian, knowing how霸道 the dragon qi was. It might have killed this human. However, the black tiger didn't care about human lives and didn't stop Longbao's actions.

Luotian now felt miserable. He knew this might be an opportunity, but he hadn't expected it to be so big. He desperately refined the dragon qi circulating in his body.

"One hour... two hours..." After three hours, Luotian opened his eyes. His clothes were soaked with sweat.

But Luotian's face showed joy. After three hours of refinement, he had successfully refined the dragon qi. Now his body's qi droplets were more numerous, reaching dozens of drops. And within his qi was a continuous presence of dragon essence.

Seeing Luotian had successfully refined Longbao's dragon qi without any issues, the black tiger finally showed a look of shock.

"Okay, okay!" Longbao clapped his hands happily.

Luotian smiled bitterly at Longbao's innocent expression, knowing he meant well but his kindness was excessive. If it were anyone else, they might have died from this dragon qi or even lost their lives.

"Um... are you helping me make more candy to eat?" Longbao looked at Luotian with anticipation.

Luotian's mouth twitched, but seeing the black tiger, he nodded slightly and approached the still-mountainous pile of herbs.

As Luotian picked up the herbs and placed them into the cauldron, a woman's cold snort echoed: "Long'er, have you been making your tiger uncle sneak out to play again?"

"Ah! Mom found out!" Hearing this cold snort, Longbao seemed to remember something and anxiously spun around.

The black tiger heard this voice and its massive body shivered.

"Quickly come back!" The woman's voice echoed again, carrying a hint of anger.

"I have to go now. You're great, I really like you. I'll give you a gift! Whoever dares to bully you here, just say my name Longbao!" As if thinking of saying his name might make people not recognize him, Longbao extended his small hand and tapped Luotian's back.

Luotian felt a burning sensation on his back, and a faint blue dragon pattern flashed briefly on his back.

The black tiger saw Longbao's actions, its massive tiger face showing human-like shock. It knew what the blue dragon mark represented. Wanting to stop it, but also knowing no one could stop it except Longbao's parents.

"Leave these fruits with you for now. Next time we meet, give me lots and lots of candy!" As Luotian observed the dragon pattern, Longbao's voice echoed again.

When did he get there? Longbao had already jumped onto the black tiger's back. The tiger let out a low roar, and in people's shocked gazes, it vanished from their sight instantly.

Luotian watched the black tiger disappear and smiled lightly, as if it were a dream.

But soon, he turned his gaze to the mountainous pile of rare treasures, his face showing joy.

Others standing outside the herb garden saw Longbao and the black tiger disappear, their pressure eased, and they approached Luotian's back. Their eyes were burning with desire at the mountainous pile of herbs.

Luotian waved his hand, and the mountainous pile of herbs vanished instantly, all stored in Luotian's storage ring.

Seeing Luotian didn't intend to share, people's faces showed disappointment but they said nothing. After all, these treasures were given by Longbao to Luotian. Without Luotian, they might have been tortured by the boy.

"Everyone, as the saying goes, those who witness it should share. I, Luotian, am definitely not selfish. I promise everyone here, including the disciples of the Crazy Sword Sect, that after we get out, I will freely refine three furnaces of pills for each of you!" Luotian said to the crowd.

"That's what I'm saying, Lu Dan Shi! This is all your own. Without you, we might still be suffering from that little kid!" A disciple of the Five Elements Sect shouted. Others also nodded in agreement.

Chapter 135: Exit

Hearing Luotian's promise, others nodded as well. After all, they hadn't done anything and still received Luotian's refined pills—they were quite satisfied.

"Alright, the priority now is to wake them up and exit this illusion!" Luotian saw no objections from others, so he whispered.

Hearing Luotian's words, people looked at the few still holding herbs and staring blankly. Their faces showed confusion; they hadn't realized they were in an illusion yet.

Dong San Si had communicated with Luotian through the pill jade tablet, so he knew they were in an illusion. He asked lowly: "Do you have any ideas?"

Luotian had the strongest spiritual awareness among them, so Dong San Si placed his hopes on Luotian.

Hearing Dong San Si's question, Luotian shook his head. He had no idea at this moment whether they were in the illusion or if those others were. It was also possible that both were in an illusion.

Luotian's spiritual awareness probed those people and found they were still bound by vines, his face darkening.

He then spread his spiritual awareness toward this side and showed a thinking expression.

Seeing Luotian's serious look, others didn't dare to disturb him. After all, he was their leader and the only one who had realized they were in an illusion.

Then, Luotian pointed to the north direction. A tall tree reaching for the clouds appeared before everyone's eyes.

Luotian walked up to the tree and smiled slightly, his right hand forming a knife-like gesture. He fiercely slashed at this ancient tree.

"Boom..."
He infused his golden element qi into his palm, and under Luotian's full power attack, the tree collapsed.

"Ah..." A surprised sound echoed, and immediately after, the herb garden disappeared from people's sight. The sound of falling from the air echoed.

People looked around, and figures kept appearing in their sight. The herb garden disappeared, revealing open land.

Those who fell to the ground showed pale faces, clearly terrified by what had just happened.

After about a quarter of an hour, people gradually recovered and looked at Luotian with gratitude: "Thank you, Lu Dan Shi for saving us!"

Luotian bowed slightly. His serious expression didn't disappear, and he whispered: "Don't get too excited yet. I was just trying my luck because there was only one tree here, no other things. Plus, we haven't left this place yet!"

"Ah?" Hearing Luotian's answer, people's faces showed concern again. They hadn't expected they were still in the illusion. They felt anxious, as being trapped here was temporarily safe but no one could guarantee what would happen next.

Luotian also felt confused, looking around. In fact, he felt this wasn't an illusion but didn't know what kind of environment it was.

While Luotian and the other sect disciples were unsure how to proceed,
In a cave deep within Da'an Forest, various gems were embedded in the stone walls, making the entire cave bright.
"Long Ge! It's about time!" A woman's voice echoed.
"Yes, Old Five is almost done. Let these people go," a middle-aged man said to a white beast beside him.
The white-headed beast nodded, looking at the sleeping Longbao with affection and gently licking his forehead.
The white beast stepped out of the cave, immediately growing rapidly to several zhang in length before stopping.
"Ugh..." It opened its mouth, exhaling a long breath. White qi accompanied strange sounds from its blood-red mouth.
As the sound echoed,
Luotian and others still searching for a way out of this strange situation felt dizzy. Then they felt their space shaking, and a long yawn echoed.
"Buzz..." Luotian felt the surrounding objects swaying, their speed increasing rapidly.
"Smack..." A沉闷 sound echoed again.
Luotian quickly regained his composure, looking around and saw lush green trees. A hint of joy flashed on his face.
"Out!" He whispered, feeling the familiar aura.
Although he didn't know how they had exited, it was better than being trapped there. His heart felt more reverence for Da'an Forest.
"Ah... who dared to sit on me!" A lamenting voice echoed from under Luotian.
Luotian felt the softness beneath him and realized he had landed on someone, quickly standing up.
"You bastard..." Wang Tianxiang was郁闷, having no idea what had happened and landing on the ground with a faceplant.
But before he could get up, a heavy body landed on him.
Wang Tianxiang felt his burden lighten and knew the person on top had stood up. He got up, about to curse, but saw Luotian standing there, staring at him. This made him swallow the word "bastard" back.
"Uncle! Let me explain!" Wang Tianxiang awkwardly rubbed his head, smiling.
"I!" Wang Tianxiang was about to explain to Luotian but felt a gust of wind above him. He instinctively jumped aside.
"Smack..." More figures fell from the sky. Although this height wouldn't harm a Refining Body Stage cultivator, some with low cultivation were knocked unconscious.
Wang Tianxiang watched a disciple from a second-rate sect being crushed under several strong men, sighing inwardly about his luck. His quick reaction had saved him from a worse fate.
Soon, nearly 100 people successfully landed, though they had fallen, which made everyone happy.
Luotian was puzzled by the people appearing out of nowhere and showed a thinking expression but didn't notice anything special.
After exiting the illusion, people turned their gaze to Luotian and asked in unison: "Lu Dan Shi, Lu Senior Brother, where should we go next?"
Although they asked this way, some people had already wanted to act independently. Especially those who had been deceived by the illusion before—those who hadn't gained anything and suffered so much.
Although disciples of the Five Elements Sect and Crazy Sword Sect had their herbs taken by Luotian, they still received three chances to refine pills from him. This made these people jealous.
While people were thinking, Luotian's lips curved slightly: "There's a formation over there! Let's check it out!"
Chapter 136: The Heaven-Complementing Yuan Formation
