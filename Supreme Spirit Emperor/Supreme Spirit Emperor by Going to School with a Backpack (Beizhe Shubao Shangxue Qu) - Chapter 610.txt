"Indeed!" The old man quickly spoke, and the vast intelligence network of Eternal Life Mountain sprang into action. Nie Yuntian sat in the Intelligence Hall, waiting for news. As soon as he discovered who it was, Nie Yuntian would immediately set out.

"Is he dead?" In a courtyard, a beautiful woman's face was filled with excitement. She cradled an infant in her arms, but the baby's eyes were purely black. This woman was Wan Youlan, the root of the feud between Luo Tian and Nie Sheng. Years ago, when Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan left, Nie Sheng had taken her to Eternal Life Mountain. Over the years, Wan Youlan had lived with Nie Sheng in Eternal Life Mountain. Her furnace body talent allowed Nie Sheng's cultivation to rise rapidly, and Nie Sheng had cracked the Dao Heart Seeding Demon technique, which required having children. Thus, Wan Youlan was one of them.

After giving birth, the Dao Heart Seeding Demon within Wan Youlan was also cracked, producing this demon child. Since birth, nearly ten years had passed, yet it remained as an infant without growing.

"Luo Tian, my entire life is due to you. I must avenge this grudge! Even if I cannot, I have my son!" Wan Youlan's face showed madness as she carried the infant into the room, waiting for news. She knew Nie Yuntian would not let this go.

While Eternal Life Mountain was moving, Luo Tian had already traveled half the way. However, Jie Du followed him like a tail, constantly irritating Luo Tian.

"Transcendence," Jie Du never stopped talking about "transcendence," insisting on following Luo Tian. He even took out a wooden fish, clacking it as he walked, reciting sutras that made Luo Tian extremely annoyed.

"Monk, if you keep following me, I'll take action and have you bedridden for half a month!" Luo Tian suddenly turned around, glaring at Jie Du with fierce eyes, his demonic aura swirling.

"Even if you make me immobile, I will still seek you out. To transcend demon cultivators is my purpose for descending this time!" Jie Du remained unmoved, responding while his wooden fish continued to ring.

"Luo Tian Senior, please wait!" As Luo Tian intended to ignore Jie Du and continue walking, Zhou Jianxiong with his guards caught up with Luo Tian.

"What is it?" Luo Tian was impatient, and the Yellower Eight Guards became tense again, their eyes on Zhou Jianxiong.

"Your master wishes to see you!" Zhou Jianxiong spoke, causing Luo Tian's body to pause and his face to show solemnity.

"Your master? The head of Zhongtian Commerce Guild?" Luo Tian asked, having heard from the Yellower Eight Guards that the head of Zhongtian Commerce Guild was a person with great influence, and he had previously killed their son.

"It's something like that. However, it is the next master!" Zhou Jianxiong replied with a smile.

"Can I refuse?" Luo Tian spoke softly. If it weren't necessary, he didn't want to get involved with Zhongtian Commerce Guild. Managing Jiutian City for the Nine Immortal Mountains clearly wasn't someone easy to deal with. Luo Tian now only wanted to safely go to the Lower Three Heavens, release Fuxingyue and others, then return to Buxian Mountain to try contacting Gu Qiansnow.

"Of course not. Luo Tian Senior, we have already sealed the news of your killing Nie Sheng. Eternal Life Mountain's Nie Yuntian is currently searching for you, waiting to find you and strike!" Zhou Jianxiong spoke softly.

"Threatening me?"

"I don't fear threats. Even if Nie Yuntian himself came, I would not be afraid!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his voice filled with confidence. Back then he had been in the late stage of True Immortal and couldn't escape an early-stage Heavenly King's attack. But now he was at the peak of True Immortal. Though not yet a match for an early-stage Heavenly King, with Buxian Stone he had once endured a Heavenly King's strike and could escape confidently.

Hearing Luo Tian's confident words, Zhou Jianxiong felt slightly startled. If anyone else had said this, he would have sneered, but hearing it from Luo Tian, Zhou Jianxiong actually believed him.

"Luo Tian Senior, having more friends means more paths. Our master isn't seeking any harm but wishes to cooperate with you!"

"As for the Yellower Eight Guards, our master isn't interested in them," Zhou Jianxiong spoke, his words carrying hidden meanings. Luo Tian and the Yellower Eight Guards naturally understood.

"Indeed, they have great influence!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He hadn't expected Zhongtian Commerce Guild to find out about Zhou Yunpeng's death so quickly and link it to himself.

"Moreover, there is an opportunity. Since Luo Tian Senior is a demon cultivator, our master sought you out. This opportunity concerns the Mind Demon Elder! I've said enough. Whether you go or not is entirely up to Luo Tian Senior. If you wish to leave, I won't stop you!" Zhou Jianxiong spoke, his voice carrying a smile.

"Mind Demon Elder?" Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly, showing interest. The Mind Demon Elder had once caused chaos in the Immortal Realm and was finally eradicated by Buxian Heavenly King. It must have had considerable power.

"I need to think about it," Luo Tian spoke softly, not continuing the conversation with Zhou Jianxiong or heading towards the teleportation array.

"Luo Tian Senior, if you've decided, please find our master at the City Governor's Mansion. With this token, no one will stop you!" Zhou Jianxiong didn't insist further, handing Luo Tian a token as per his master's instructions. A golden token with the character "Heaven" (å¤©) engraved on it, shimmering with golden light, clearly of great value.

"The Heaven Token!" The Yellower Eight Guards' eyes showed surprise but said nothing, standing rigidly behind Luo Tian.

"Thank you. I'll find you when I've decided!" Luo Tian nodded, bowing to Zhou Jianxiong before walking with the Yellower Eight Guards through Jiutian City's streets. Luo Tian found a luxurious inn to stay at, but to his dismay, Jie Du still followed him.

The inn was luxurious with dining areas. Luo Tian ordered a meal, seating the Yellower Eight Guards while he played with the Heaven Token.

"Monk Jie Du, won't you eat something?" Luo Tian looked at the persistent monk sitting there.

"Everything in the world has spirit. Since entering Buddhism, I've been practicing fasting and don't eat anything," Jie Du shook his head gently.

"I advise you to fast too. Even if you eat vegetarian, it's still killing life; reduce the karma!" Luo Tian said nothing at first, but once he spoke, Jie Du immediately began preaching.

"My heavens..." Luo Tian felt a headache. This monk was as bad as Zheng Xin, but Zheng Xin's words were nonsense while this Jie Du spoke endless sermons about Buddhism.

"What is the token's function?" Luo Tian asked Guiyi, noticing the expressions of Guiyi and others.

"The Heaven Token is a VIP token from Zhongtian Commerce Guild. With it, you are always a guest of honor within any faction of Zhongtian Commerce Guild and can borrow three billion spiritual stones. Only ten thousand Heaven Tokens have been issued throughout Zhongtian Commerce Guild!" Guiyi straightened his posture and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Ah, I see!" Luo Tian nodded. Ten thousand tokens seemed many, but compared to the vast population of the Immortal Realm, it was nothing more than a drop in the ocean.

While Luo Tian and others were talking, a dark-cloaked figure walked into the inn, catching Luo Tian's attention. A perfect physique in black attire, a dark hood covering his head, and a thin veil concealing his face. A cold aura radiated from him, making people shiver, but Luo Tian felt a sense of familiarity on this slender figure.

"Ghost Cultivator?" Luo Tian's eyes widened slightly, his gaze fixed on the elegant figure.

Chapter 2306: Reencountering Gu Qiansnow

The elegant figure not only caught Luo Tian's attention but also the inn's people. However, the cold aura made people hesitant to approach.

"Is it a ghost cultivator? Could it be a genius from the Ghost King Sect?" Someone spoke, their eyes filled with curiosity. The ghost cultivators of the Xumi Mountains rarely appeared, unlike the Ghost King Sect who produced one every hundred years. But they were also rare because people often viewed them with strange glances, considering their nature peculiar.

The woman's gaze swept across the inn before she found an empty seat and sat down without acknowledging others' stares.

"Such a good figure!" People whispered, unable to see her face but admiring the tight-fitting clothes that accentuated her curves.

"Such a deep descent into demon cultivation, alas... I didn't expect such an individual to be so immersed in demons!" Jie Du sighed longingly.

"Beauty, would you like to sit with me?" As Luo Tian was puzzled, someone smiled and approached the woman.

"Go away..." A cold voice echoed from beneath the hood, causing the young man to shiver. The woman's black aura surged, forming a terrifying ghost behind her, its eyes fierce and glaring at the young man.

The woman's voice was bone-chilling, making everyone in the inn feel cold. Especially that black ghost made people shiver, but Luo Tian felt a stronger sense of familiarity from this voice.

"This voice..." Luo Tian's eyes showed contemplation, his mind recalling a figure. His body trembled slightly.

"Alright, I'm leaving..." The frightened young man quickly spoke and returned to his seat. As the young man left, the ghostly figure behind the woman disappeared, its aura returning to her body.

After this incident, the hall became somewhat tense. However, after a quarter of an hour, Zhou Jianxiong entered the inn and surveyed the hall before walking up to the woman.

"Miss Gu, my master has been waiting for a long time. Please come with me to the City Governor's Mansion!" Zhou Jianxiong bowed slightly, addressing the black-cloaked woman.

"Alright," the woman nodded, obviously expecting someone to find her. She rose and followed Zhou Jianxiong.

"Who is this woman? Surely she's a genius from the Ghost King Sect, otherwise Zhou Commander wouldn't be so polite!" People were astonished by Zhou Jianxiong's politeness, becoming more curious about her identity.

"Miss Gu, from the Ghost King Sect? Is it Miss Gu Qiansnow from the Ghost King Sect? The Ghost King Sect only has one female genius with the surname Gu, right?"

"It's a pity. I heard Miss Gu Qiansnow has extraordinary talent but became a ghost cultivator!" People whispered, their eyes filled with admiration.

"It's indeed her!" Luo Tian felt excited. He hadn't expected to meet Gu Qiansnow so quickly. From her voice, he had an 80% certainty that this ghost cultivator was Gu Qiansnow. However, Gu Qiansnow definitely didn't recognize him.

"Luo Tian Senior, have you decided?" Zhou Jianxiong hadn't left but saw Luo Tian in the hall and bowed to him.

"I've decided! I'll go!" Luo Tian stood up without hesitation, responding. Zhou Jianxiong was stunned; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to change his mind so quickly. The contrast was too great.

"Ha! Then please let the two of you follow me!" Zhou Jianxiong laughed and spoke to Luo Tian and Gu Qiansnow.

"Watch me, I'll dig out your eyes!" Gu Qiansnow's cold voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears, making him smile bitterly.

"Alas... really..." Luo Tian felt speechless. They were husband and wife, but Gu Qiansnow didn't recognize him, which made Luo Tian feel uncomfortable.

However, Luo Tian knew Gu Qiansnow had reasons for not recognizing him and had prepared in advance.

Luo Tian and Gu Qiansnow, one a demon cultivator and the other a ghost cultivator, had icy auras. Jie Du's aura was pure and holy, forming a sharp contrast with the two.

"Two cultivators, the sea of suffering is endless; returning to the right path is salvation!" Jie Du followed Luo Tian and others closely, continuously clacking his wooden fish while reciting sutras.

"Monk, if you keep chanting, I'll rip your mouth apart!" Gu Qiansnow's cold voice echoed. Even through the veil, Luo Tian could feel Gu Qiansnow's icy gaze.

"Master, I'm doing this for your good. Otherwise, you'll sink deeper..." Jie Du didn't stop talking.

"Commander Zhou, can you get this monk away?" Luo Tian was also impatient. Who could bear a monk like Jie Du?

"This, sorry, my master also invited this high-ranking monk!" Zhou Jianxiong spoke helplessly.

"Roar..." Gu Qiansnow was impatient. Though it was on the street, she directly attacked Jie Du, summoning a black ghost to bite him.

"Om!" Jie Du's eyes flickered slightly. His golden figure appeared behind him, like a golden Buddha, and he struck with one hand toward the black ghost.

"Boom..." The explosion echoed. The black ghost seemed to be restrained by the Buddha's figure, letting out a fierce scream. The golden Buddha hand struck the ghost, emitting holy light and erasing it.

"Monk, who are you hitting?" Luo Tian sneered. He couldn't let Gu Qiansnow be harmed, even if she didn't recognize him. After all, she was his wife.

As he spoke, Luo Tian moved. His foot struck the ground, breaking the stone floor. His figure instantly appeared in front of Jie Du, his fist covered with demonic patterns striking toward Jie Du.

"Monk, I was only defending myself and didn't intend to harm this female cultivator!" Jie Du spoke softly. Even facing Luo Tian, who was stronger than him, he showed no fear.

"Boom..." A punch flew out. The Buddha figure collapsed. Jie Du's body took two steps back, blood spurted from his mouth, but he still maintained a determined expression.

"Truly... a dog's ointment..." Luo Tian looked at Jie Du and sighed longingly.

"Monk, if you dare to touch her again, we won't be done!" Luo Tian shouted loudly. Then he smiled at Gu Qiansnow: "Old... lady, rest assured; no one will harm you with me here!"

"You're not a good person either!" Gu Qiansnow looked at Luo Tian's smile and coldly replied, but she didn't attack again.

"Three of you, don't fight. We all need to cooperate now; it's better not to hurt the relationship!" Zhou Jianxiong spoke, feeling his master had made a mistake by finding these three oddities.

Gu Qiansnow coldly glanced at Luo Tian and Jie Du before walking toward the City Governor's Mansion. Luo Tian chuckled slightly, following Gu Qiansnow closely.

"Clack... clack..." Jie Du continued to knock the wooden fish, following Gu Qiansnow and Luo Tian closely.

After half an hour of walking, they quickly arrived at the grand City Governor's Mansion. The entire mansion was massive and imposing, looking more like a vast sect than a city governor's residence. Zhou Jianxiong led them in, and the guards didn't stop them. Zhou Jianxiong led Luo Tian and the others into a main hall.

"Ha! Welcome, three of you to Jiutian City. I am the vice chairman of Zhongtian Commerce Guild, Zhou Zhiwen!" As they arrived at the hall's entrance, a young man walked out. His body was slightly plump, his face glowing with redness, and he wore a standard smile. His eyes flashed with sharp glintsâclearly a shrewd merchant.

"Is this the son of the head of Zhongtian Commerce Guild? The next master?" Luo Tian looked at this plump man, recalling Zhou Jianxiong's introduction of Zhou Zhiwen.

Gu Qiansnow didn't speak, and Jie Du wore a gentle smile but continuously recited sutras, making Zhou Zhiwen feel awkward.

"Long have I heard of your esteemed reputation, Master Zhou. Today's meeting confirms it!" Luo Tian noticed the awkwardness and spoke quickly. He didn't want to clash with Zhongtian Commerce Guild, especially since he wasn't sure about Zhou Zhiwen's attitude. He didn't want to make things too tense.

"Master Luo Tian, indeed a powerful figure from Buxian Mountain. You're truly the youngest elder! Please come in, three of you!" Zhou Zhiwen showed no resentment and waved to Luo Tian and the others, opening the hall's door to invite them in.

"Excuse us!" Luo Tian bowed and stepped into the hall. Gu Qiansnow and Jie Du followed, while Yellower Eight Guards and Zhou Jianxiong didn't enter.

The hall was luxurious, with several jade tables set out. The tables were filled with delicacies. One table remained empty, with only a cup of white water on it. The usually calm Jie Du showed slight satisfaction in his eyes, and he sat at the empty table.

"Very thoughtful!" Luo Tian praised Zhou Zhiwen's ability to be polite. He sat down at the table next to Gu Qiansnow.

"Three of you, please wait for one or two days. I've invited some people who haven't arrived yet. For now, stay in the City Governor's Mansion and let me entertain you!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke to Luo Tian and the others.

"I have limited time; I'll try to be quick!" Gu Qiansnow coldly replied, sitting there.

"Yes, I have other matters!" Luo Tian grabbed a piece of meat from the table and put it in his mouth, eating heartily. He sighed inwardly at the value of this banquet and didn't want to waste it.

"Brother Zhou, have I come too late?" As they were speaking, a clear voice echoed from outside the hall.

White as snow, long flowing hair, Fu Bei smiled and walked in. Upon entering, he saw Luo Tian and the others and showed surprise, briefly hesitating.

Chapter 2307: Feeding the Ghost

"Not late. You came a bit earlier than I expected!" Zhou Zhiwen smiled and invited Fu Bei to sit.

"Who is this?" Fu Bei sat down, his gaze immediately on Gu Qiansnow who remained silent. He had seen Luo Tian and Jie Du, but this was his first encounter with Gu Qiansnow.

"This is the genius of the Ghost King Sect, Gu Qiansnow! These two must be familiar to you!" Zhou Zhiwen introduced.

"Ah, the genius of the Ghost King Sect! I am Fu Bei from the Eastern Emperor Sect. In the future, please take care of Miss Gu!" Fu Bei smiled and bowed to Gu Qiansnow.

"Hmph," Gu Qiansnow nodded slightly upon hearing Fu Bei was from the Eastern Emperor Sect but said nothing more.

"Having heard Miss Gu is a beauty of the Immortal Realm, one of the ten beauties, I wonder if I have the qualifications to witness her true face!" Fu Bei's eyes sparkled as he spoke to Gu Qiansnow.

"This is trying to flirt with my wife!" Luo Tian thought inwardly, looking at Fu Bei and his body radiating a cold aura.

"No," Gu Qiansnow coldly replied, then said nothing more.

"Uh..." Fu Bei was speechless and embarrassed by Gu Qiansnow's response, making Luo Tian laugh secretly while Fu Bei felt awkward.

"Ha! Four of us; we're missing two more. Once the other two arrive, we'll depart!" Zhou Zhiwen tried to ease Fu Bei's awkwardness and spoke.

"Master Zhou, I don't know why you've invited us. I only know it's related to the Mind Demon Elder, but the Mind Demon Elder was already eradicated by Buxian Heavenly King. There shouldn't be anything left, right?" Fu Bei took the opportunity to speak softly.

"Indeed, it's related to the Mind Demon Elder. Three million miles away from Jiutian City is a place called the Illusion Demon Ridge. We at Zhongtian Commerce Guild recently discovered that this ridge might be the former cave of the Mind Demon Elder!"

"Although the Mind Demon Elder was eradicated by Buxian Heavenly King, his cave remains unknown. The Mind Demon Elder was a super strong cultivator at the late stage of Heavenly King. His cave must be a treasure trove!"

"Therefore, I invited all of you to explore it. I don't care about other things; I only want the Illusion Demon Stone, which is very mysterious. Other opportunities are all yours. It's said that the Mind Demon Elder's Illusion Demon Scripture is an ultimate secret, and it might also be in his cave!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, introducing to Luo Tian and others.

"If that's true, it's worth the trip!" Fu Bei nodded slightly.

"But why didn't Zhongtian Commerce Guild go themselves? Why invite us?" Luo Tian asked, voicing his doubts. He didn't believe Zhongtian Commerce Guild would lack the strength to explore the Mind Demon Elder's cave.

"Master Luo, you don't understand. Zhongtian Commerce Guild has a rule: if someone reports the discovery of treasure, the guild will send strong cultivators. In that case, Heavenly King-level cultivators might be dispatched. Then it would be divided by the number of people and strength. In that case, I wouldn't get the Illusion Demon Stone!" Zhou Zhiwen replied.

"Ah, I see!" Fu Bei nodded. He didn't worry about Zhou Zhiwen's tricks since they were all disciples of the Nine Immortal Mountains, the dominant sects in the Immortal Realm. If anything happened, their sect would thoroughly investigate it. Even if Zhongtian Commerce Guild was powerful, they would eventually be caught and held accountable.

"Once we finish the banquet, I'll arrange for you to rest. Once the remaining two arrive, we'll depart!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, continuously raising his cup to Luo Tian and Fu Bei.

By midnight, Luo Tian and others had become familiar with each other. This referred to Fu Bei, Luo Tian, and Zhou Zhiwen. Gu Qiansnow remained cold-faced, while Jie Du smiled constantly, reciting sutras to purify the food they ate.

Luo Tian arrived at the room Zhou Zhiwen had arranged for him, his eyes filled with contemplation. The Yellower Eight Guards stood guard outside his room.

The room was luxurious, and there were several maids inside. They wore simple clothes. Luo Tian knew that if he wanted, these women would be at his disposal, clearly trained.

"Please leave. I want to be alone..." Luo Tian spoke to the women, feeling a bit like a thief. He wondered if Zhou Zhiwen had noticed his interest in Gu Qiansnow and placed his room next to hers. He was annoyed that Fu Bei's room was on the other side of Gu Qiansnow.

Luo Tian felt relieved to be free of Jie Du's tail, no longer having to listen to his sermons or recitations. The women said nothing and bowed before leaving the room.

Luo Tian sat on the bed, his mind filled with thoughts. He longed to find Gu Qiansnow but knew that if he went openly, she would kick him out.

"Buxian Stone!" His eyes flickered slightly as he thought of Buxian Stone and summoned it.

"Master, what's your command? Do you want me to empty this place? I have experience with that!" Buxian Stone's excited voice echoed.

"Don't cause trouble!" Luo Tian felt a headache. He thought Buxian Stone had become addicted to stealing, except for the one time he attacked Jiang Yulong in the demon cave.

"Let's go to the adjacent courtyard!" Luo Tian's body flickered and disappeared from his room, appearing on Buxian Stone.

"Alas..." Buxian Stone reluctantly agreed and carried Luo Tian floating toward Gu Qiansnow's courtyard.

After a moment, Buxian Stone led Luo Tian into Gu Qiansnow's courtyard and into her room. At this moment, Gu Qiansnow was seated on the bed, her hood still on, with black aura swirling around herâevidently she was cultivating.

"Such dedication!" Luo Tian sighed, watching Gu Qiansnow but soon noticed something unusual about her.

"Roar..." A scream echoed. A black ghost appeared beside Gu Qiansnow, biting her shoulder. Crimson blood flowed from her shoulder.

The ghost absorbed Gu Qiansnow's blood, and its form became more solid. A surge of black aura flowed from the ghost into Gu Qiansnow's body.

"Feeding the Ghost!" Luo Tian exclaimed, watching Gu Qiansnow constantly refining the aura from the ghost.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He hadn't expected Gu Qiansnow to cultivate such a method. As the former prince of the Wheel of Hell, he knew about "Feeding the Ghost."

Feeding the Ghost was a method some ghost cultivators used to accelerate their cultivation. The cost was that when the ghosts grew strong, they might devour their masters. Few used this method except those extremely confident or ruthless due to its great drawbacks.

"This is a problem," Luo Tian stood on the red earth, his eyes thoughtful as he pondered how to eliminate the ghost in Gu Qiansnow's body.

Time passed slowly. Gu Qiansnow cultivated for an hour before stopping, and the ghost disappeared from her side. Gu Qiansnow waved her hand to cast a barrier around the courtyard, then slowly removed her hood, revealing a pale face. Sweat dripped from her forehead, clearly the cultivation had been painful. Luo Tian knew this because "Feeding the Ghost" made the ghost's aura in her body not very refined, easily causing erosion.

A white wooden bucket appeared in the room. Inside was a bucket of black liquid.

"Gu Qiansnow won't be..." Luo Tian looked at the bucket, feeling strange.

"Master, you're too kind to me. I didn't know there were such benefits!" Buxian Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his face dark.

"Seal it!" Luo Tian spoke softly. Waves of energy flew from his hands, and the divine laws flowed to cover the entire red earth.

"Master... you..." Before Buxian Stone could resist, Luo Tian caught him off guard and sealed him.

"Damn it, my wife is bathing; I can watch. Who else would dare?" Luo Tian kept attacking until he felt secure, then stopped.

As soon as Luo Tian sealed Buxian Stone, his eyes glowed with greed toward Gu Qiansnow standing by the bucket.

Gu Qiansnow began to slowly remove her clothes, exposing large areas of white skin before Luo Tian's eyes. He was overwhelmed with desire and wanted to break free from Buxian Stone to fight her for three hundred rounds.

"My wife has become even more beautiful. It seems she's developed again!" Luo Tian thought to himself, admiring the view and restraining his impulses.

Finally, under Luo Tian's gaze, Gu Qiansnow sat in the bucket. Her eyes were closed, and waves of energy radiated from her body. The water in the bucket began to churn as if a demon was swimming within it.

A painful expression appeared on Gu Qiansnow's face, making Luo Tian feelå¿ç¼. He knew the demon in her body was consuming her cultivation.

"Idiot!" Luo Tian finally couldn't bear it and activated Buxian Stone to hover above Gu Qiansnow's head.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian waved his hand, and a white flower flew from his handâBiyang Hua. At this moment, Luo Tian finally understood why the other Gu Qiansnow in the End Times Forest had used Biyang Hua. It was to purify the demon within her body.

The pure white Biyang Hua hovered above the bucket, emitting a soft white light. It was beautiful and made Gu Qiansnow's body pause slightly.

"Is this... Biyang Hua?" Gu Qiansnow's eyes showed surprise, looking at the suddenly appearing flower. She grabbed it with her hand.

A look of excitement appeared on Gu Qiansnow's face. She hadn't expected Biyang Hua to appear suddenly. The Ghost King Sect had escaped from Hell, so they naturally recognized Biyang Hua.

"With this Biyang Hua, I have a greater chance of containing the demon when it becomes strong!" Gu Qiansnow spoke softly, holding Biyang Hua in her hand. Her face had a rosy hue.

"But where did this Biyang Hua come from?" Gu Qiansnow spoke softly, then her eyes narrowed slightly. Her body flickered and she put the hood back on, disappearing from the spot and appearing in the courtyard.

Outside the courtyard stood a white-cloaked Fu Bei. Seeing Gu Qiansnow appear, he quickly spoke to the women.

"Leave, I'm not that kind of person!" Fu Bei spoke to the simple-clothed women, his eyes filled with seriousness.

"Is it you?" Gu Qiansnow's eyes narrowed slightly. She looked at Fu Bei, her eyes showing confusion.

"Ah, it's Miss Gu!" Fu Bei adjusted his clothes and smiled seriously, addressing Gu Qiansnow.

"Lecher!" Gu Qiansnow coldly sneered and waved her hand. A black long sword flew from her hand, forming a black dragon that slashed toward Fu Bei with dark divine light.

"Miss Gu!" Fu Bei didn't know what had happened and quickly vanished from the spot.

"Plop..." The black sword fell from the sky, piercing into the ground like cutting tofu.

"Miss Gu, I don't know what I've offended you for!" Fu Bei appeared ten zhang away. He looked at Gu Qiansnow, who was surrounded by ghostly aura. Instinctively, he shivered.

"Is this what you gave me?" Gu Qiansnow's eyes were cold, and she waved her hand. Biyang Hua appeared in her hand.

"This..." Fu Bei looked at the flower and showed surprise. However, he quickly realized something.

"Yes, it was indeed me who gave you this flower. I noticed some signs of ghostly aura erosion on your body, so I sent this flower to help you. However, I had no intention of offending you!" Fu Bei stood tall and spoke confidently, secretly laughing. He didn't know who had done this good deed without leaving a name, but he had accidentally gained a big benefit.

"Did you stay outside the courtyard?" Gu Qiansnow asked, puzzled. If he had been in her bedroom, she would have gone mad.

"I did stay outside the courtyard!" Fu Bei spoke earnestly. He instinctively felt it was better to say he had been outside the courtyard.

"Thank you," Gu Qiansnow grabbed the black long sword and didn't speak further, turning into her bedroom.

"Don't worry. Miss Gu, if you have any trouble in the future, please find me. I Fu Bei will definitely help!" Fu Bei smiled and watched Gu Qiansnow enter her room.

"Shameless, shameless!" Luo Tian listened to their conversation and cursed inwardly. He hadn't expected his good deed to be taken by Fu Bei, this bastard.

However, Luo Tian didn't dare appear openly. If he did, it would scare Gu Qiansnow greatly. That way, she would definitely know he had watched her bathe and wouldn't have a good outcome.

"Idiot, dare to flirt with my wife!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He didn't stay with Gu Qiansnow any longer, but since she was fine, he felt relieved.

Dust drifted. Luo Tian awakened Buxian Stone and sent it flying toward Fu Bei's room to see what kind of person this bastard was.

Fu Bei smiled and returned to his room. Inside, a woman stood there. Her beauty was quite remarkable. Fu Bei entered and the woman immediately approached him, respectfully coming to his side to help him change clothes.

"Good-for-nothing, no good intentions!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, watching Fu Bei's hands already wandering over the purple-clothed woman.

Luo Tian quickly understood Fu Bei's strategy. He wanted to appear as a righteous man in front of Gu Qiansnow, but he hadn't expected an unexpected gain.

Luo Tian didn't want to watch Fu Bei and the purple-clothed woman's indecent scenes. He controlled Buxian Stone back to his residence.

"Idiot, flirting with my wife! I've never suffered such a loss!" Luo Tian cursed loudly. His mood was terrible.

Suddenly, one night passed. During this time, Luo Tian had been thinking of ways to kill Fu Bei, this good-for-nothing.

The next morning, Luo Tian stepped out of the courtyard as if calculated. Gu Qiansnow also walked out at the same time.

"Good morning, Miss Gu!" Luo Tian quickly greeted her. Gu Qiansnow didn't respond but walked toward the City Governor's Mansion entrance.

"Master Luo, you're early!" Fu Bei, refreshed and energetic, walked out of the courtyard and greeted Luo Tian. Seeing Gu Qiansnow's back, he quickly caught up with her.

"Good-for-nothing!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He stood there, watching Fu Bei speak a few words with Gu Qiansnow and then stand beside her as they both left the City Governor's Mansion.

"Green grassy plains, your home!" Buxian Stone spoke with a sigh in Luo Tian's mind, making his face dark.

"I'll see what happens if Gu Qiansnow learns this bastard's true face. How will he deal with it?" Luo Tian sneered inwardly, took out the rarely used Thousand Illusion Mask and put it on his face, transforming into a rugged man with an imposing appearance.

Luo Tian flickered and followed Gu Qiansnow and Fu Bei. They didn't sense Luo Tian's presence at all. At this moment, Luo Tian was like a passerby.

They walked out of the City Governor's Mansion and quickly reached Jiutian City's streets. Fu Bei kept speaking, while Gu Qiansnow said nothing and didn't let Fu Bei leave.
