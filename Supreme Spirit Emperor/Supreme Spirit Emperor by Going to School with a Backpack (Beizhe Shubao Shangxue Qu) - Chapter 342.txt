Luo Tian's qi and blood were nothing short of earth-shaking, being his very heart's blood, containing the vast life essence within him, and even some characteristics of an immortal herb.
The blood mist continuously merged together, radiating divine power that seemed to have been triggered by something, causing the blood mist to finally merge slowly.
Under the eyes of several people, Xu Liyi's body finally coalesced and lay beneath the starry sky.
"Still not returning to merge? What are you looking at here!" Luo Tian softly scolded Xu Liyi's spirit, who was staring blankly.
"Ugh..." Upon being scolded by Luo Tian, Xu Liyi's ashen face was stunned, then he looked at Luo Qingqing: "Qingqing, did you mean what you said earlier?"
"Don't be so slow, hurry up and come back to life for me!" Luo Qingqing snorted coldly, but her eyes showed wild joy.
"Alright!" Xu Liyi quickly rushed into his physical body and slowly opened his eyes.
As soon as he opened his eyes, a figure rushed over and embraced Xu Liyi: "From now on, your life is mine. I won't let you die; you mustn't die!"
"Mm, mm!" Xu Liyi was overjoyed and embraced Luo Qingqing tightly, his eyes filled with obsession.
"Since ancient times, deep feelings are hard to hold on to; it's always the tactics that win people's hearts!" Xu Liyi roared in his heart, his eyes filled with admiration as he looked at Luo Tian and Zheng Xin.
Although the plan had some changes, the result still left Xu Liyi very satisfied.
"Big sister Qingqing, can you two stop being affectionate for a while and let Xu Liyi put on his clothes first!" Gu Lei and Zheng Xin sighed deeply, then looked at the embracing Xu Liyi and Luo Qingqing with a teasing gaze.
Chapter 1384: Unprecedented
"Ah..." Upon hearing Gu Lei and Zheng Xin's words, Xu Liyi felt a chill through his body, then a slight blush appeared on his face.
"What are you looking at!" Luo Qingqing also flashed a slight blush on her face, shouting at Zheng Xin and Gu Lei, then waved her hand to create a barrier that blocked people's view.
"What are you staring at, making others watch you!" Within the barrier, Luo Qingqing shouted fiercely at Xu Liyi.
"From now on, this thing can only be seen by my aunt!" The fierce voice echoed again, leaving Luo Tian speechless.
"This is really too fierce! Sister Qingqing looks good, but this personality ruins her appearance!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei also looked at them with sympathy, whispering.
"This sister is really impressive!" Sun Kemin grinned, eyes filled with admiration as he looked at Xu Liyi emerging from the barrier, looking happy.
"Everything has its counterpart!" Luo Tian smiled, his face slightly pale but with a sense of relief. No matter what, the ending was good, even though there were many mishaps in between.
"Let’s go! Let’s find out who was behind it. Luo Tian, your brother-in-law was bullied; you handle it!" Luo Qingqing addressed Luo Tian.
"Little brother, avenge me!" Xu Liyi’s eyes lit up upon hearing Luo Qingqing’s words; he was delighted to have gained a new title without reason.
"Brother-in-law..." Luo Tian looked at Xu Liyi’s annoyingly flirtatious demeanor, feeling a bit annoyed, his gaze filled with helplessness.
"Alright, let’s go back first. Settle your matters before starting the plan!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness; these people had become too overbearing, even attacking in the Four Sacred Star Domains and targeting someone as early as the Epoch Initial.
"Hmph!" Everyone nodded, their eyes also showing coldness; especially Xu Liyi and Luo Qingqing, as Xu Liyi had almost died.
"Hey kid, you’re back. Why don’t you come sit with me?" As everyone was about to depart, a voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him pause.
He had chosen the location at Break God Cliff to meet the Soul-Eating Beast and inquire about whether Gu Qianxue and the four women had visited Break God Cliff. After all, their strength was formidable, especially Sun Mengru, who had long been overshadowed by Luo Tian’s fame. However, Sun Mengru was also a Primordial Divine Body, one of the Nine Bodies, and her strength was undoubtedly among the top in the Nine Domains. The places that could make the four women disappear were few, and it was clearly related to the Nine Absolute Lands.
Thinking of the four women walking through the extremely dangerous Nine Absolute Lands, where even Epoch Peaks could perish, Luo Tian felt unbearable sorrow.
"You all go back first. I’ll visit Break God Cliff!" Luo Tian said to Gu Lei and Zheng Xin, then his body flickered as he flew towards Break God Cliff.
Break God Cliff remained as it was, shrouded in gray mist; even Luo Tian couldn’t fully discern its true form.
But since Luo Tian wasn’t the first time coming to Break God Cliff, the Soul-Eating Beast didn’t trouble him. In a moment, Luo Tian arrived at the altar, seeing Zhongli Tian’s physical body and the Soul-Eating Beast’s massive form kneeling before Zhongli Tian, its gray eyes gazing at Luo Tian.
"Senior!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully, gazing at the Soul-Eating Beast. After fifteen years, Luo Tian had entered the Epoch Initial, but in his eyes, the Soul-Eating Beast felt even more terrifying; its gray eyes resembled a vortex that could swallow people.
"Epoch Initial!" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke softly, nodding slowly, its gaze utterly indifferent.
"Your cultivation speed isn’t great. My master was already in the Epoch Mid during your age!" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke softly.
"Junior has experienced the Three Fears of Heaven and Humanity, so my cultivation was hindered. Soon enough, I will catch up!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes filled with confidence.
"Three Fears of Heaven and Humanity!" Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Soul-Eating Beast’s eyes slightly changed, its gaze now different towards Luo Tian.
The Soul-Eating Beast had certainly heard of the Three Fears of Heaven and Humanity. Luo Tian’s ability to reach Epoch Initial despite falling sixteen years behind others was already commendable.
"Senior, have you seen four women come to Break God Cliff?" Luo Tian’s gaze was respectful as he asked the question he urgently needed an answer to.
"Four women. I remember that a few years ago, four girls with remarkable talent came here, and one of them had a quality not inferior to yours; it was probably the Primordial Divine Body!" The Soul-Eating Beast began recalling.
"Where did they go? Do you know?" Luo Tian became excited, finally obtaining some information about the four women.
"They stayed here for a few days. I told them about your possible presence in the Origin Domain, but they failed to enter the barrier and left. As for where they went after that, I don’t know."
"Origin Domain?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows deeply; if the four women were in the Origin Domain, it would be a real problem, likely encountering great danger.
"Don’t get too worried. Entering the Origin Domain is extremely difficult; the methods set by the Supreme Master of Intercepting Heaven are not something ordinary people can break through. They might now be trapped in one of the Absolute Lands, which is why you couldn’t find them!" The Soul-Eating Beast continued.
"Hmph!" Luo Tian nodded; he knew that finding the four women wouldn’t happen overnight.
"Senior, why did you call me here?" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the Soul-Eating Beast. He had once promised to help it; now his strength was decent, though not matching the Soul-Eating Beast’s, but he had some methods it couldn’t achieve.
"Do you still have that Epoch-End Soul you just showed?" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.
"I still have one!" Luo Tian waved his hand, releasing another Epoch-End Soul and sending it to the Soul-Eating Beast’s front.
"One isn’t enough!" The Soul-Eating Beast sighed deeply, its gray eyes showing a hint of helplessness.
"What do you need the Sage-End Soul for, Senior?" Luo Tian asked in confusion.
"It has great use. My two masters left a descendant, sealed within this Break God Cliff!" The Soul-Eating Beast smiled slightly, gazing at Luo Tian.
"What?" Upon hearing the Soul-Eating Beast’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes showed disbelief; he hadn’t expected Break God Cliff to hold such a secret.
Zhongli Tian, a fully developed Reincarnation Body. If he hadn’t passed the Epoch Master position to his wife, Ji Miaoyin, he would have been a surefire Epoch Master in that era.
Ji Miaoyin, the Epoch Master, was even more formidable. She subdued the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, her methods reaching the heavens; her bloodline was undoubtedly the strongest in the Nine Domains.
These two heavenly-level children were truly earth-shaking; their bloodline power was immense. Luo Tian couldn’t even imagine further, for if they appeared, they would certainly subdue their peers. Even Luo Tian didn’t believe he could be a match for the child of this Epoch Master and the fully developed Reincarnation Body.
"Back then, Ji Miaoyin sealed him here because one epoch could only have one Epoch Master. Thus, the bloodlines of these Epoch Masters couldn’t break through that barrier to become those who subdued heaven and earth. Therefore, Ji Miaoyin sealed her child with special methods, waiting for an epoch without an Epoch Master to awaken it!" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke, stirring Luo Tian’s heart.
"Senior, are you planning to let Zhongli and Ji Miaoyin’s child be born in this epoch?" Luo Tian’s gaze was solemn.
If such a heavenly prodigy were released, it would certainly cause a stir in the Nine Domains. Luo Tian thought further—this meant he would have an potential enemy for future Dao attainment.
"Are you afraid?" The Soul-Eating Beast’s eyes showed a hint of amusement, observing Luo Tian’s changing expression.
"It’s not that I’m afraid. In truth, I have no desire for Dao attainment; it was forced upon me. I just wish to live peacefully with my wife, family, and friends—it’s not a misfortune. Epoch Masters can live two epochs, but by then, my beloved ones would have all passed away, leaving me alone in the world. What loneliness!" Luo Tian shook his head gently.
"I think Zhongli and Ji Miaoyin’s child should have a decent character, not causing us trouble!" Luo Tian spoke softly.
"Moreover, having multiple potential enemies to contend with is also a good thing!" Luo Tian’s face showed a smile, but his body radiated formidable battle intent.
"Alas… your character is rare in this world. If there weren’t no other choice, I wouldn’t have chosen to let the master’s child appear in this epoch to compete with you!" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke softly.
"Surely, I’m not the only one thinking this. The sacred sects and clans of the Nine Domains that have produced Epoch Masters must all share this thought, for the sealing time is limited!" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke softly.
"Senior, are you saying other sacred sects and clans also have descendants of Epoch Masters?" Luo Tian’s heart trembled again, sensing this epoch might be an unprecedented great era.
The Ancient Royal Clan, the descendants of human Epoch Masters—each is a monumental event!
"Hmph. So you still need to strengthen your cultivation; there are too many enemies. I’m not sure if the little master can subdue all of them." The Soul-Eating Beast sighed deeply, swallowing the Epoch-End Soul into its mouth.
"What else can I do for you, Senior?" Luo Tian felt pressure again, asking the Soul-Eating Beast.
Chapter 1385: All Flocking In
"Try to gather more Epoch-level souls. You couldn’t do it back then, but now you should be able to!" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke, gazing at Luo Tian with intense eyes.
"Hmph. Epoch-Initial souls should be no problem; if the Epoch-Mid ones aren’t too strong, I should be able to kill them!" Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He had decided to help the Soul-Eating Beast, which aligned perfectly with his plan; those souls came from the strong ones who had attacked Xu Liyi.
"Hmph. I won’t let you run in vain. I can’t leave this Break God Cliff, nor can my puppets stay long. So everything depends on you. Once the little master’s seal is broken, I’ll give you a great boon!" The Soul-Eating Beast sighed softly, its eyes showing an indescribable expression.
"Senior, you’ve already helped me enough. I’ll do this favor no matter what!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully.
"Hmph. Alright, you may leave! If there’s something you can’t solve, you can flee to Break God Cliff; I can kill anyone for you. Also, the master’s body is at your disposal three times!" The Soul-Eating Beast spoke again, his voice filled with confidence.
"Anyone can be killed." If this were said by anyone else, even an Epoch-Peak powerhouse, Luo Tian would believe it. But in Break God Cliff, he believed the Soul-Eating Beast had such power.
"Hmph. Then I’ll take my leave." Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the Soul-Eating Beast before flying towards the Tianyuan Continent.
Along the way, Luo Tian noticed people constantly heading to the Tianyuan Continent. After overhearing some discussions, he learned that Xu Liyi and Luo Qingqing’s wedding had spread.
Xu Liyi, though not as prominent in the Nine Domains as Luo Tian or Long Jie, had a considerable reputation. Eventually, some people came—like Long Jie from the Beast Domain, the demons of the Divine and Demon Domain, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Lu Tianyu from the Fire Domain, these新一代 leaders.
" Soon I’ll meet some old friends!" Luo Tian smiled, transforming into a rainbow and instantly appearing on the Tianyuan Continent, returning to the Ancient Heaven Palace.
Due to not wanting to reveal his identity, Luo Tian didn’t plan to attend directly but chose to meet with close friends in the Ancient Heaven Palace.
The first to arrive were Lu Tianyu and Du Yuying from the Fire Domain. The couple, husband and wife, immediately were called by Luo Tian into the Ancient Heaven Palace upon their arrival.
"Big brother Luo Tian!" Du Yuying rushed towards Luo Tian upon arrival but was pulled back by Lu Tianyu, who looked at him with suspicion.
Then, he flew towards Luo Tian with a surprised expression: "When did you return!"
"A few days ago. You’ve all had a good time these years!" Luo Tian smiled, patting Du Yuying’s head. Though they were all older now, Du Yuying was still his little sister in his heart.
"Big brother!" As the three spoke, a deep voice echoed in the Ancient Heaven Palace. A mighty figure appeared before Luo Tian.
Long Jie now radiated a noble aura, his gaze commanding without anger. But upon appearing in the Ancient Heaven Palace, Long Jie’s entire body trembled and he flew towards Luo Tian.
Without a word, the brothers embraced. Long Jie had long searched for Luo Tian’s news; their relationship was extremely close, so he was certain Luo Tian hadn’t died and would return one day.
"Ha ha, Luo Tian! I knew you weren’t dead!" Purple light flickered; behind Long Jie was Diao Dezhu, who looked at Luo Tian with excitement and tightly gripped his hands.
"Master!" A youth with a determined expression and flowing blood energy approached Luo Tian, kneeling on the ground with respect.
"Zi Mo!" Luo Tian gazed at the youth before him, his eyes filled with admiration. He hadn’t expected that a disciple he had taken casually would have grown so much.
"Big brother, your disciple’s talent isn’t great, but he’s diligent. Achieving this now is unsurprising!" Long Jie smiled, satisfied with his carefully cultivated Zi Mo.
"Hmph." Luo Tian nodded. He knew talent didn’t mean everything; before obtaining the Epoch Book, he had been a nobody. Who could say for sure about luck and opportunities?
"Luo Tian!" Nan Gong Yuqing followed, appearing in the Ancient Heaven Palace with a surprised expression and walking over with authority.
"Nan Gong!" Luo Tian collided with Nan Gong Yuqing again, his eyes filled with admiration as he looked at the familiar friends around him.
At this moment, Zheng Xin and Gu Lei entered as well. Only Xu Liyi was busy outside; the group became jubilant.
"Hey kid, you hid really deep! Only now telling us Luo Tian is alive!" Nan Gong Yuqing and Lu Tianyu looked at Gu Lei and Zheng Xin with displeasure, starting to drink with them.
Everyone was genuinely happy, having lowered their cultivation. They had just learned Luo Tian hadn’t died and returned.
"Don’t you dare!" Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, and Chen Zhanbiao were forced to drink so much they could barely speak, but kept pouring it in.
"You’re really relaxed!" As the group was happy, two figures entered with a cold aura that made everyone shiver. But upon seeing them, they smiled.
"Tian Luo, Xiu! You two bastards have been where for so long? Don’t act cold in front of me; smile for the old man!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei, two troublemakers, pulled the two in with bottles.
Cold faces showed smiles, but still felt unnatural. It was as if after their arrival, the atmosphere changed, making young geniuses like Zi Mo and Dong Yichen feel oppressed.
"These two uncles are really scary!" Dong Yan’er looked nervous, standing behind Dong Yichen and Zi Mo.
"It’s okay. They are also your master’s friends!" Dong Yichen’s eyes glowed, looking at them with admiration.
"I knew you weren’t dead!" Tian Luo smiled, approaching Luo Tian, clinking bottles and downing it.
"You two have been doing well these years!" Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, gazing at their power with a smile.
"That’s right. These two have become famous throughout the Nine Domains. Who doesn’t know the name of Shura? Even the people in the Shura Domain didn’t dare to be as ruthless. These two have killed countless targets!" Zheng Xin started his long-winded talk, recounting their achievements, leaving Luo Tian shocked.
These two have killed countless sects’ disciples, with only one failure—assassinating the new Phoenix Clan’s disciple.
"The new Phoenix Clan disciple?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He hadn’t expected the Phoenix Clan to produce another prodigy, even defeating Shura and Tian Luo.
"Strong!" Xiu said only that, then remained cold.
"Opportunity, we’ll meet!" Luo Tian smiled but his eyes showed coldness.
"Alright, today we don’t talk about anything. Brothers, it’s been years since we met; let’s get drunk and chat for three days and nights—no, seven!" Zheng Xin shouted.
"Ha ha, come on, you kid still the same!" Upon Zheng Xin’s words, someone was不服 and chaos began.
These years, the group hadn’t met often in their respective domains. Even when they did, they would sigh over Luo Tian’s death.
But Luo Tian’s resurrection became a bond, making them happy and closely connected.
Luo Tian looked at the jubilant group with a smile, his heart also excited, joining their drinking contest.
The group celebrated for three days until Xu Liyi’s wedding day, then left the Ancient Heaven Palace, leaving Luo Tian alone.
"My strength is still insufficient!" Luo Tian sat in the Ancient Heaven Palace, sighing. His group—Long Jie, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Xiu—had reached Epoch Mid, while the rest were in Epoch Initial.
"The new Phoenix Clan disciple, even Shura and Tian Luo failed to assassinate. This must be a heavenly prodigy. Who is it?" Luo Tian muttered.
Before long, seven days passed. Luo Tian spent these days teaching his disciples and son; after fifteen years away, he hadn’t fulfilled his duty as a master.
On the eighth day, those attending Xu Liyi’s wedding entered the Ancient Heaven Palace.
Another few days of chaos, then Luo Tian recounted his plan to Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing.
"Why not push forward? With our current strength, who could be our opponent?" Long Jie and others looked puzzled.
"Right! With our three domains and the demons, having three Epoch Treasures, which sect wouldn’t tremble? These years we’ve been too repressed. Why hide?" Diao Dezhu showed disdain.
"It’s not yet the time. I don’t want the Nine Domains to be severely damaged by the Ancient Royal Clan." Luo Tian shook his head.
Chapter 1386: The Hunt Begins
Tianyuan Continent, Tian Dao Sect. Luo Tian walked on Tian Dao Mountain, his eyes showing respect as he approached the four statues.
Under the four statues, Zhang Ziping, Ji Chen, and Lei Yong sat cross-legged with smiles, watching Luo Tian approach step by step.
"Three senior brothers!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his gaze filled with respect as he felt their powerful auras.
"Back?" Zhang Daotian smiled, gazing at Luo Tian as if he hadn’t heard of his death.
"Hmph, back!" Luo Tian gazed at Zhang Daotian’s statues, his eyes flashing with intensity.
Now, Luo Tian has obtained the Master of Soul Sealing’s inheritance, giving him a special perception of souls. His current cultivation is vastly improved, and his vision has risen significantly.
"True spirit has given birth to a soul!" Luo Tian’s eyes showed tension as he watched the gray mist within the four stone statues.
"But I wonder if it’s your master’s original one!" Zhang Daotian sighed softly. They had guarded here day and night, naturally knowing the statues’ changes.
"Sealing!" Luo Tian moved his hands, waves of energy flying out. He pointed and the waves entered the four statues.
"Wum…" Waves of humming echoed. The gray mist within the statues emitted thoughts, as if familiar with Luo Tian.
Zhang Daotian’s group suddenly changed faces, watching the four gray mists within the statues. They felt the mists had gained sentience and began to grow slowly.
"No matter if it’s your master’s soul or not, it still has a great connection to the four of you!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with intensity as he whispered.
Zhang Daotian and the three, though unknown to the Nine Domains, were revered by people on Tianyuan Continent.
"Senior, are you going to guard here forever?" Luo Tian showed a hint of pity, gazing at Zhang Ziping.
"Go, do what you must. Don’t forget your senior’s words; this place will always be your home!" Zhang Ziping spoke softly, his voice carrying a sigh.
"Hmph." Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at Zhang Ziping. Their talent was high; if they left, they’d be geniuses, but they had been sitting here for years.
"Don’t worry about us. Our current cultivation is also due to this sitting!" Zhang Ziping smiled, waving his hand and a green sword flew from it.
Thunder surrounded the green sword, making Luo Tian’s mind focus as he gazed at it.
Tian Dao Thunder Sword, once the sect’s treasure. But back then it was just a Heaven-grade artifact. Now, looking at it, Luo Tian felt a slight sense of awe.
"Take it! Tian Dao Thunder Sword, this artifact has changed over the years!" Zhang Ziping smiled, handing it to Luo Tian.
"Your current cultivation has surpassed us. So what we can help you with is only this Tian Dao Thunder Sword!" Lei Yong spoke, smiling at Luo Tian.
"Hmph." Luo Tian nodded. To avoid exposing his identity, he indeed needed some methods now.
Luo Tian left the Tian Dao Mountain and quickly returned to Wu Xing Mountain. Now, half a month had passed since Xu Liyi’s wedding; Wu Xing Mountain had returned to normal.
Luo Tian returned to the Ancient Heaven Palace and found everyone standing there, even Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing hadn’t left. His face showed surprise.
"What’s wrong?" Luo Tian looked at everyone, asking.
"Luo Tian, when will the plan be executed? I’m getting antsy!" Before others could speak, Xu Liyi stood up seriously.
"Ah?" Luo Tian was surprised, looking at Xu Liyi’s enthusiasm with confusion.
"You just got married; joining the plan isn’t good, is it?" Luo Tian shook his head. He hadn’t included Xu Liyi in the plan.
"For Tianyuan Continent and the Four Sacred Star Domains, even if I just got married, I’ve been holding back!" Xu Liyi patted his chest, eyes filled with determination.
"Hmph…" Zheng Xin and Lei Yong immediately sneered, looking at Xu Liyi with disdain.
"Big brother, isn’t it because your wife keeps making you write poems? You couldn’t do it!" Chen Zhanbiao spoke gruffly. Not sure why, but his body had grown taller, now as tall as two adults.
"Zhanbiao…" Xu Liyi looked at Chen Zhanbiao, gritting his teeth. Why was it always his brothers who exposed him?
"Ah, I said the wrong thing again!" Chen Zhanbiao scratched his head, looking embarrassed.
"Every day a poem, where can I come up with one!" Xu Liyi’s face showed bitterness, recalling his pain these days.
The first two days after marriage were okay, but after a few days, Luo Qingqing remembered Xu Liyi’s poems from before and demanded one each day.
Xu Liyi originally couldn’t write poems. That poem was one he had heard when he saved a scholar who wanted to commit suicide, and it was good so he memorized it.
"You’re not a scholar!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei mocked, eyes filled with mockery.
"Little brother, save me! I can’t take your sister’s torment. I’ll go hide for a few days and come back when this poem-writing urge passes!" Xu Liyi looked at Luo Tian pitifully, eyes filled with desperation.
"Alright! I have a spot for you here!" Luo Tian shook his head, feeling helpless as he spoke to Xu Liyi.
"What position?" Xu Liyi’s eyes lit up, gazing at Luo Tian.
"Bait!" Luo Tian smiled faintly, speaking to Xu Liyi.
"Alright, follow the previous plan. Remember, safety first!" Luo Tian smiled.
"Good!" Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, under Sun Kemin’s changed appearance, everyone left the Ancient Heaven Palace.
Only Xu Liyi, Diao Dezhu, Long Jie, and Nan Gong Yuqing remained in the Ancient Heaven Palace.
"We should go too. Let’s see if we can meet those who attacked you last time!" Luo Tian’s face showed a layer of coldness as he spoke to Xu Liyi.
"Let’s go!" Xu Liyi, with a hint of smugness, flew out of the Ancient Heaven Palace.
Luo Tian and the others flickered their bodies, hiding themselves, following Xu Liyi to wait for the fish to bite.
As soon as they left the Tianyuan Continent and appeared outside the Four Sacred Star Domains, several powerful auras locked onto Xu Liyi.
"This Xu Liyi is really lucky; he survived last time and even got married!" Several voices echoed in the void.
"This kid’s胆 is really big; he dares to come out alone. Seems like these days he’s been too successful! Forgetting the lesson last time!"
"This time he’ll definitely die!" The void echoed with cold laughter.
Xu Liyi flew aimlessly, his face calm. He knew that with Luo Tian and Long Jie around, even if it was some assassins or even Sun Miechen, a peerless genius, killing him would be as hard as climbing the sky.
Xu Liyi felt it was enough and stopped on an uninhabited continent. Though he hadn’t sensed anyone following, he knew they wouldn’t let him go.
"Wum…" Humming echoed in the void. As Xu Liyi grew bored, three figures emerged from the void, surrounding him with disdain.
"Xu Liyi, die!" As the three appeared, they launched powerful attacks to kill Xu Liyi quickly.
But the next moment, they saw Xu Liyi with his hands raised, looking at them with mockery.
"Idiot! You think I’d fall for the same trick twice!" Xu Liyi coldly scolded, ignoring their attacks.
"What’s going on?" They were confused; they hadn’t sensed anyone hiding, but Xu Liyi was so sure.
"Roar…" As the three were shocked, a dragon roar echoed from the void, instantly shattering their attacks.
"Epoch Mid, there’s an ambush!" They realized instantly; those who could evade their senses must be stronger.
The void shattered, and four powerful figures emerged from it—Luo Tian, Long Jie, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Diao Dezhu.
"Flee! Split up!" The three’s eyes flickered, seeing the changed Long Jie and others. They immediately lost their will to fight and tore through the void.
"Each of you gets one! Remember to leave their souls!" Luo Tian spoke, the Tian Dao Thunder Sword in his hand.
"This small task doesn’t need your help!" Nan Gong Yuqing held a blood-red sword, stabbing the torn void.
Next moment, the blood-red sword rushed into the void like a venomous snake, directly charging at a black-cloaked man.
"Return!" Long Jie sneered, grabbing a golden dragon’s claw to snatch another fleeing black-cloaked figure.
Purple light flickered; Diao Dezhu vanished from the spot, his terrifying speed making even Luo Tian feel a chill.
"They’ve all grown!" Luo Tian sighed, sheathing the Tian Dao Thunder Sword. He knew the three couldn’t escape.
Chapter 1387: Undercurrents Stir
Roaring echoed in the void. The golden dragon’s claw tore through the void, instantly seizing a Epoch-Initial powerhouse, slicing him into blood mist that floated in the void.
"This is so strong!" The gray soul floated out, his face showing shock as he gazed at the golden dragon’s claw.
On the other side, the blood-red snake devoured another black-cloaked assassin of Xu Liyi.
"Why don’t you keep running!" Mocking voices echoed. Purple light flickered, and the thunderous sound continued. Compared to Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing, Diao Dezhu had clearly used more effort to catch the killer.
Three utterly embarrassed figures fell into the sight of Luo Tian and five others, their true appearances revealed.
The three were middle-aged men, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at Luo Tian and four others. Though all three were Epoch-Initial, they hadn’t expected to be completely crushed by Long Jie’s group.
"Smack…" Xu Liyi appeared before the three, cursing: "You bastards! Last time you almost succeeded. If it weren’t for my mistake in recognizing you, would you think you could kill me?"
"Unexpectedly, you still dare to assassinate me! You’re really tired of living!" Xu Liyi repeatedly slapped the three, turning them into blood mist.
"Soul extraction!" Luo Tian grabbed with both hands, stopping the three from regenerating blood and directly capturing their souls.
"Who are you!" Luo Tian’s face was cold, an invisible pressure making the three souls tremble into silence.
"I smelled a disgusting scent on them—disgusting phoenix!" Diao Dezhu sniffed, his face showing coldness.
