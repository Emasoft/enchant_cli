" I said, if I wanted to pluck out your eyes, I would do it!" Luo Tian sneered, extending his hand. The two daggers that had been slain by Luo Tian flew into his hands.

"What do you want to do?" Yi Jianren's eyes showed fear, watching the two daggers that glimmered with cold light in Luo Tian's hands.

The answer to Yi Jianren was two flashes of cold light, which were the last things he saw.

"Ahh..." a pitiful cry echoed. The two daggers accurately pierced Yi Jianren's eyes.

"Oops, my hand slipped, sorry!" Luo Tian chuckled lightly and then launched a punch. Three punches struck Yi Jianren's body.

"Boom..." black energy surged, and the next moment, Yi Jianren was transformed into swirling black mist. Finally, it coalesced again and appeared before Luo Tian's eyes.

"Haha, Luo Chen, my current state is immortal!" Yi Jianren laughed loudly, and his body grew more black scales.

Chapter 2183: Kill You a Hundred Times

"Immortal body?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light, watching Yi Jianren who stood up again as if nothing had happened.

"He just killed the armor on his body, and although Yi Jianren was injured, it wasn't fatal. This secret technique is the foundation of Huangtian Temple; only the disciples of the sect are allowed to practice it," Ye Qiu said softly.

"But I'm curious, what's the secret technique of Lunzhuan Temple? I've never seen anyone from Lunzhuan use it!" The nameless youth spoke.

"The secret technique of Lunzhuan Temple isn't nonexistent, but no one has managed to master it. Even the great power of the Black and White Wuchang had mastered two people, showing how terrifying that technique is. Therefore, the secret technique has been classified as a forbidden one by Lunzhuan Temple," Ye Qiu replied, his eyes filled with admiration.

"Ah, I see. Everyone's eyes showed understanding. Then they resumed observing the battle between Luo Tian and Yi Jianren."

"Come on, come kill me! If you can kill me, then you're really skilled!" Yi Jianren laughed loudly and flew forward again towards Luo Tian.

"Killing you isn't hard, but since you have an immortal body, it's not easy to die either!" Luo Tian shifted his position and rushed towards Yi Jianren. The two clashed again.

Although Yi Jianren hadn't died, he wasn't as brave as before. Obviously, the two daggers had done considerable damage to Yi Jianren.

The thunderous sound continued. Luo Tian constantly suppressed Yi Jianren, who was in a sorry state. However, deep within his heart, he had decided to wear down Luo Tian by using his immortal body and exchanging injuries.

Luo Tian's combat experience was unparalleled. In the inner world of Nai Zao Jing, he had fought against ten versions of himself for half a year. Although it was brutal, most attacks were difficult to truly harm Luo Tian. Plus with Longyuan, not long after, Yi Jianren was once again knocked to the ground by Luo Tian.

"Kill me!" Yi Jianren, although lying there, had a look of contempt in his eyes as he shouted at Luo Tian.

"Let you be arrogant for now, and then let you cry!" Luo Tian chuckled lightly and cast a series of restrictions on Yi Jianren's body.

"Is this broken restriction enough to restrain me?" Yi Jianren showed contempt and started to break free from the black seals that wrapped around him.

Luo Tian, however, had a smile on his face and walked towards Wang Gang.

"Damn it, he's trying to finish off the others first!" Yi Jianren saw Luo Tian heading towards his companions and felt a little nervous. However, the restrictions Luo Tian had cast weren't something he could break through in a short time.

Wang Gang and the Huangtian disciple were at their life-or-death moment. Both of them were in a sorry state, with Wang Gang slightly disadvantaged but not yet defeated by the Huangtian disciple. Just as they clashed, Luo Tian arrived and with Longyuan's sword, he slashed at the Huangtian disciple.

"Ahh..." The disciple roared and clashed with Luo Tian's sword. His shoulder was cut deep, revealing the white bones beneath.

"Haha!" Before the disciple could catch his breath, Wang Gang laughed and swung his long sword into a black tiger. The tiger bit down on the disciple's neck.

The black tiger severed the disciple's neck, and his body fell to the ground.

"Crack..." At this moment, Yi Jianren finally broke free from Luo Tian's restrictions and stood there with a grim face.

"Wow..." The crowd was stunned, watching Luo Tian on the battlefield. No one expected that he had turned the tide.

"Haha! Who says our Lunzhuan Temple isn't strong? You still call us trash?" The disciples of Lunzhuan Temple shouted loudly, their voices filled with excitement.

Cheng Ping's face was full of admiration. His eyes turned to Luo Tian standing there, and his gaze changed. He knew that no matter the outcome, Luochen's name would be remembered by people.

"There are still two left!" Luo Tian ignored the restrained Yi Jianren and turned his gaze to Mota.

"You go help Mota, I'll take care of this one!" Luo Tian smiled and looked at the pale Yi Jianren.

"No need!"

"If I hadn't lost an eye, I wouldn't be in such a sorry state!"

"I've been suppressed for so long. It's time to end it!" Mota spoke coldly, tears of blood flowing down his cheeks. His twin eyes merged together, and a black moon descended from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. The woman who had been fighting Mota looked pale and confused but quickly regained her composure. She waved her hands, and red snakes flew out from her hands, hissing as they wrapped around the black moon.

"Boom... Boom..."

However, the red snakes were shattered by the black moon. In a thunderous explosion, they pressed down on the woman wearing revealing clothes and immediately subdued her.

"Spit..." Blood spewed from the woman's mouth. As she tried to get up, the shattered black moon transformed into swirling black mist and formed a large black hand that grabbed her and threw her out of the barrier.

"I don't kill women!" Mota spoke coldly, standing beside Luo Tian.

"Mo Shiyi? Xiao Bai, you've met your opponent!" Ye Qiu smiled and spoke to the nameless youth beside him.

Baiming, a prodigy of Fengdu Temple, was born with a ghost eye and had great power. Only Ye Qiu could suppress Baiming, and even then it was only when Ye Qiu used his full strength.

"I'm also very eager to see someone who specializes in eyes," Baiming smiled and looked at Mota.

"You're not the weakest of the eight small heavenly kings' descendants. This generation of Lunzhuan Temple is indeed not the weakest," another youth spoke.

"Then we'll face them next!" Ye Qiu chuckled, his eyes showing excitement.

"Just you left!" Luo Tian's gaze turned to Yi Jianren. Wang Gang and Mota also looked at Yi Jianren with ill intent.

"What about it? I'm immortal. You can't kill me, and I haven't lost yet!" Yi Jianren trembled as he spoke. He was determined to endure until Luo Tian and the others ran out of strength, then he would win!

"An immortal body. That's truly powerful. Let's begin!" Luo Tian laughed and rushed towards Yi Jianren.

Mota and Wang Gang also ran to Yi Jianren's front, and the three of them attacked him, completely shattering him.

"Kill him a hundred times. I want to see if you can endure until we run out of strength! Or kill him a hundred times, and he still doesn't die!" Luo Tian laughed loudly as he watched Yi Jianren reassemble.

"I..." Yi Jianren had just reassembled when Luo Tian's fist arrived, giving him no chance to speak.

"Haha! It really feels good!" Wang Gang laughed and continuously slashed with his long sword, as if chopping vegetables.

The thunderous sound continued. Luo Tian and the others kept attacking, completely slaughtering Yi Jianren. Yi Jianren was constantly dying and reassembling, obviously in great pain. Luo Tian could deeply understand this kind of suffering.

"One... ten..."

People were speechless as the three kept slaughtering Yi Jianren. They hadn't expected such a result, with an invincible immortal body ending up in such a pitiful state.

Yi Jianren was also extremely frustrated, but even with an immortal body, there were limits. If he died too many times, he would truly die. Even if he could be revived by a celestial king using the power of heaven and earth, his strength would drop one level.

Under people's astonished gaze, Luo Tian actually did what he said and killed Yi Jianren a hundred times. Wang Gang and Mota had long since run out of strength.

"This person is not to be messed with. He really killed him a hundred times!"

"Yi Jianren had only provoked the Lunzhuan Temple and flirted with the saint's daughter, but he ended up like this..." Other temples' people started to talk.

At that moment, the Huangtian Temple was in a terrible state. Besides the woman thrown out of the battlefield by Mota, two people had died, and even the saint's son was being beaten up.

"I think Yi Jianren will have a shadow in his heart when he uses the Huangtian demon seal again," people whispered.

Black mist spread, and Yi Jianren reassembled. This time, his scales did not appear, and he was weakly lying there.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian took a long breath and felt relieved as he clapped his hands, looking at the weak Yi Jianren. He spoke softly: "How are you holding up? I still have half my strength left!"

"I..." Yi Jianren trembled as he spoke, wanting to say the words "surrender," but after dying a hundred times, he was truly exhausted. He deeply regretted not wanting to wear down Luo Tian and his companions, but now he knew he was wrong. If he died again, he would truly be dead.

"I didn't expect to die tens of thousands of times before!" Luo Tian thought to himself. Before Yi Jianren could say the words "surrender," he stepped on him again.

However, this time Yi Jianren did not reassemble. Black mist spread around and gradually dispersed.

"Dead?" Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, extending his hand. An invisible wave spread from his hands.

Seeing this gesture, Wang Gang and Mota's faces slightly changed. Not only them, but the faces of the disciples of Lunzhuan Temple who were familiar with this action also changed.

"Luo Chen, don't be reckless!" The deputy head of Lunzhuan Temple at the early stage of仙王 shouted loudly.

"What's wrong?" Other temple people looked puzzled, not knowing why the disciples of Lunzhuan Temple were so nervous.

However, when Luo Tian's gray soul appeared in his hand, they understood why the disciples of Lunzhuan Temple were so tense.

"Ahh..." Yi Jianren's gray soul appeared in Luo Tian's hand, with a terrified look on his face. He looked at Luo Tian smiling.

Chapter 2184: From Sorrow to Joy

On the battlefield, Luo Tian held the gray soul of Yi Jianren. The soul's face showed fear and looked at Luo Tian, never expecting that Luo Tian had actually captured his soul.

"Capturing Yi Jianren's soul! My god!" The other temple's geniuses showed disbelief, watching Luo Tian.

This time, Luo Tian truly became the center of attention. Even those fighting on another battlefield默契 stopped their fight and turned their eyes to Luo Tian.

"Luo Chen, don't be reckless. Don't be reckless! I'm not something, but I won't die!" Yi Jianren shouted loudly.

"I heard that my son died like this!" Tian Gui Wang's eyes showed killing intent, looking at Luo Tian.

"It's truly not worth dying, but I did promise my wife to dig out your eyes!" Luo Tian chuckled and extended his hand. Two gray eyeballs flew from Yi Jianren's soul, then exploded.

"Ahh..."

"My eyes!" A pitiful cry echoed. Yi Jianren's soul struggled violently in Luo Tian's hand.

"Luo Chen, don't cause a big trouble!" Several deputy heads of Lunzhuan Temple transmitted to Luo Tian mentally, fearing Yi Jianren would become the second Duan Boyang and that would really be a problem.

"Relax!" Luo Tian waved his hand, sending Yi Jianren's soul away. He truly didn't want to kill Yi Jianren but only took out his eyes from the soul, which was just a severe injury. After recovery, he would be fine.

Yi Jianren's soul instantly floated out, and a faint sense of suction could be felt, pulling Yi Jianren's soul away. Seeing Luo Tian release Yi Jianren's soul, everyone sighed deeply and looked at Luo Tian as if looking at a monster.

"What kind of fight is this? If we really provoke this person, won't we truly die?" People immediately started to panic and looked at Luo Tian with fear.

It was originally just a competition without life-threatening danger. Even if they died, the elders would retrieve their souls from the cycle of reincarnation and use the power of heaven and earth to reshape their bodies. However, Luo Tian's appearance had broken this balance. If they couldn't beat Luo Tian, they might truly die.

"Competing with others requires strength. Competing with him not only needs strength but also your life!" People started to talk, looking at Luo Tian.

"Luo Chen, this matter isn't over. If you have the courage to kill me, do it!" Yi Jianren felt he was about to enter reincarnation and became bold. He shouted at Luo Tian.

"Oh?" Hearing Yi Jianren's words, Luo Tian smiled. As Yi Jianren's figure was about to become transparent, Luo Tian extended his hand and pointed at it. It seemed like time had stopped, but not for people, but for souls. Yi Jianren's transparent soul suddenly paused.

"Damn it..." Yi Jianren was terrified, feeling the suction behind him getting smaller. He saw Luo Tian's smile, like a demon smiling.

"Come back!" Luo Tian extended his hand and the wave again affected Yi Jianren's soul.

"Damn it, hurry up and pull my soul into the cycle of reincarnation!" Yi Jianren shouted in his heart, hoping that the suction behind him would pull his soul into reincarnation.

However, Luo Tian's restraining power was not easy to deal with. It constantly pulled Yi Jianren, so he was tragic. On one side was the powerful Luo Tian, and on the other side was the hell's reincarnation force. Both pulled him from front and back, as if to tear Yi Jianren apart, making him extremely painful. Yi Jianren regretted that he shouldn't have taken a moment of pleasure, but he hadn't expected that Luo Tian could wrestle his soul from the cycle of reincarnation.

"Soul Blade!" Luo Tian chuckled and a gray soul blade appeared above his head. He extended his hand, and it flew towards Yi Jianren.

"I'm sorry, just let me go!" Yi Jianren was about to cry. He couldn't see but could feel a powerful presence approaching him.

"Buzz..." The gray soul blade appeared behind Yi Jianren, as if cutting through a chance. Yi Jianren's transparent soul gradually solidified and floated back into Luo Tian's hand.

"What did you say just now?" Luo Tian asked Yi Jianren, his voice filled with mockery.

"Devil! You are a devil!" Yi Jianren shouted in fear. He had felt the cycle of reincarnation, but Luo Tian had pulled him back again.

Luo Tian extended his hand and sent Yi Jianren's soul to the three deputy heads of Lunzhuan Temple.

"Please let the three deputy heads handle it. After all, he will be caught back anyway. I'm just saving them some effort!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

"Good, good!" The three deputy heads sighed deeply. Luo Tian's actions had already given them a lot of face.

"Senior Master Shou Gui Wang, can you announce the result?" Luo Tian looked at people who were a bit dazed and asked Shou Gui Wang.

"Uh, good!"

"Lunzhuan Temple wins!" Shou Gui Wang quickly spoke. His eyes showed admiration, and even the face of Zun Gui Wang had a look of deep thought.

"Haha! Our Lunzhuan Temple's saint's son has won two matches. Even the worst is seventh or eighth place!" The disciples of Lunzhuan Temple shouted loudly, looking at Luo Tian who walked down from the battlefield.

A black horse, almost everyone felt this thought in their hearts. They hadn't expected that the weak Lunzhuan Temple would have defeated two teams this year.

If defeating the Yin Shen Temple was a mutual slaughter, then defeating the Huangtian Temple had completely made Lunzhuan Temple become an equal team with other temples.

"There's hope. This time, our Lunzhuan Temple really has a chance! As long as the head and deputy heads don't get the last place, we really might gain control over another hell!" The elders of Lunzhuan Temple became excited and looked at Luo Tian standing on the battlefield.

"Buzz..." As people were shocked, the sky was torn open. An overwhelming pressure came from the sky, and a battlefield descended from the heavens into people's sight.

"Haha, Hei Bai, it seems you still need to cultivate for a few more years," a mocking voice echoed. Ten figures stood on the high platform, and among them, only one person had a frown. This was Hei Bai and Bai Chang.

Although their faces were unclear, it could be seen that Hei Bai and Bai Chang's current state and mood weren't particularly good. Obviously, the results of the head's competition hadn't met their expectations.

Indeed, it was so. Ten people competed, and Hei Bai and Bai Chang were the last. Their strength was simply too weak.

" Fengdu Temple first... Shiluo Temple second..." At the same time, a ranking appeared in the sky. There were corresponding points behind it. When people saw the pitiful ten points under Hei Bai and Bai Chang's names, they immediately understood why.

"Boom... Boom..." Just as Hei Bai and others had just appeared, another battlefield also echoed with a series of thunderous sounds. Waves of energy surged, and forty figures stood on the battlefield. Their clothes were in disarray, and they looked at each other.

"Third..." Hei Bai and others looked up at Du Jianxing and the others standing on the high platform. They also saw the rankings of the deputy head's competition.

Du Jianxing and four others sighed deeply. In the past, they were always second or first place. However, Shiluo Temple and Fengdu Temple had suddenly made a move to suppress them.

"Eighty points..." Hei Bai and Du Jianxing sighed deeply. Two battles added together, it was eighty points. Although it wasn't too low, it was still difficult. Everything would depend on the results of the saint's battle.

"Haha! Our Lunzhuan Temple will definitely enter the top nine this time!" However, as Hei Bai and Du Jianxing sighed, the disciples of Lunzhuan Temple shouted loudly.

"What?" The disciples of Lunzhuan Temple's shouting made Hei Bai and others slightly stunned. Then they looked at Luo Tian and the others who had just walked down from the battlefield.

"What's going on?" Hei Bai and others were confused, not knowing why the disciples of Lunzhuan Temple were shouting. However, they could feel that something had turned around, and this turn was due to Luo Tian and the others.

"Defeated Yin Shen Temple, defeated Huangtian Temple!" The next moment, a series of information appeared in Hei Bai and others' minds, causing their bodies to tremble.

"So that means the worst is fifth or sixth place. There are fifty or sixty points!" Hei Bai and Du Jianxing's eyes immediately became excited.

"Haha! Huangtian Temple's saint's son is still at zero points. They have only accumulated sixty points so far!" Hei Bai immediately laughed, he hadn't expected that Luo Tian and his group had not lost a single battle until now.

Although Hei Bai and others had hoped before, it was just hope. They hadn't expected that Luo Tian's group could be so strong. Not only did they defeat Yin Shen Temple, but they had also defeated Huangtian Temple. Now it was clear that Lunzhuan Temple definitely wouldn't be the last.

"Finally, we are not the bottom!"

"You four, the head will definitely reward you heavily!" Hei Bai's mouth stretched to his ears.

On the contrary, the head of Huangtian Temple had a grim face and looked in the direction of the disciples of Huangtian Temple. His body slightly trembled.

At this moment, the direction of Huangtian Temple looked quite pitiful. Only one woman dressed in revealing clothes stood there, her face pale.

"Where are they?" The head of Huangtian Temple suddenly shouted and looked around. He didn't find the figures of Yi Jianren and others, and a bad feeling arose in his heart.

"Haha! Huang Da Xian Wang, Huang old ghost, your people seem to be here!" Hei Bai proudly took three gray souls from the hands of the three deputy heads at the early stage of仙王 and spoke to the head of Huangtian Temple with a triumphant expression.

"Black and White!" The head of Huangtian Temple's face immediately turned dark. At this moment, he also understood that Yi Jianren and others had lost, and it was even more pitiful.

Chapter 2185: Battle Against Fengdu Temple

"Three people were killed..." The head of Huangtian Temple looked at the three weak souls clutched by Hei Bai and Bai Chang. It was clearly that they had just been pulled from the underworld.

"It seems I don't need to cultivate for a few more years. Our Lunzhuan Temple also doesn't have to be the bottom anymore. Alas, it's a pity," Hei Bai kept talking and was as happy as a monkey. If it weren't for his position, Hei Bai might have even jumped up.

It was very satisfying. It had been a long time since Lunzhuan Temple had controlled two hells. Originally, this time they had a big chance, but he got the last place. This last place wasn't because Hei Bai and Bai Chang's strength was inferior to other heads, but if they really fought hard, it would be hard to say who would win. Hei Bai and Bai Chang hadn't expected that Luo Tian's group had been so brave, defeating both Huangtian Temple and Yin Shen Temple, making Lunzhuan Temple no longer worry about being the last.

"The rest is random. If we can get it, great; if not, no problem!" Hei Bai spoke to Luo Tian's group.

Lunzhuan Temple now had no more worries about being pushed out. They just needed to strive for a higher ranking. A high ranking only gave the right to choose which hell first, which was an added benefit for Lunzhuan Temple.

"I swear, that means our Yin Shen Temple might also be the last!" Tian Yu Lao Gui's face slightly changed. Their Yin Shen Temple was now closely matching Huangtian Temple's score. If they lost again, their Yin Shen Temple might be the last.

The situation now was that Fengdu and Shiluo Temples would be first and second, while the third to eighth places would be fought over by the remaining temples. The ninth and tenth places would depend on the scores of Huangtian and Yin Shen Temples.

"Good luck, Tian Yu Old Ghost!" Hei Bai was really in a good mood. Everyone could see his arrogance.

"The next battle is against the Equality Temple, fighting Yin Shen Temple..." Shou Gui Wang spoke with a smile. He could feel that Luo Tian's position in Lunzhuan Temple was more solid now. If nothing unexpected happened, the next head of Lunzhuan Temple would definitely be Luo Tian.

"It's not interesting..." Luo Tian shook his head lightly and sat down to recover his strength.

At this point, Luo Tian had no more motivation. Even if they won first place in the saint's battle, Lunzhuan Temple's ranking would only slightly improve. It wouldn't get the top spot.

"It's a drag, I didn't expect Hei Bai and Bai Chang to be such a waste. They even got the last place..." Luo Tian sighed inwardly and looked at Hei Bai and Bai Chang who were still gloating.

"Ah-choo..." At this moment, Hei Bai was still proudly mocking the heads of Huangtian and Yin Shen Temples. He sneezed suddenly, spitting out a big spray that landed on their faces.

"Is this not our head? I must have made a mistake!" The disciples of Lunzhuan Temple looked at Hei Bai, who was like a monkey. They felt embarrassed because it was the first time they had seen Hei Bai in such a state.

"Shouldn't our head be a dignified elder? Why is he acting like a joker?" The disciples of Lunzhuan Temple discussed. Some had never seen Hei Bai before, and this moment shattered their image of a dignified head.

"Go away..." Tian Yu Old Ghost wiped his face, which was covered in saliva.

With the appearance of ten temple heads, few people paid attention to the battle between Equality Temple and Yin Shen Temple. Everyone was watching the ten heads because they were the ones who controlled hell.

"I should go and discuss some important matters!" The head of Fengdu Temple was an old man with a smile. His figure disappeared from people's sight.

Hearing the head of Fengdu Temple's words, others including Hei Bai and Bai Chang trembled slightly. They disappeared from people's sight.

Luo Tian and the others sat down, recovering their strength. Meanwhile, the battle on the battlefield continued. Fan Tianyin's group had good strength, but after fighting with Luo Tian, he used the Yin Shen Nine Transformations once and was slightly exhausted. Although they had recovered two battles, their strength was still somewhat damaged.

On the other hand, Cheng Ping and others had no major damage. Even their martial arts secrets hadn't been exposed much.

In a short half-hour, the battle ended. Equality Temple became the winner. In that same time, Luo Tian and his group had recovered to normal.

Qiu Long looked at Luo Tian with regret on his face.

"Sorry, I've been a burden for you!" Qiu Long spoke softly and lowered his head.

"It's fine, nothing big. Without your restraint, we wouldn't have had it so easy. It's good that we won!" Luo Tian chuckled and saw Qiu Long's regret.

"Yes, it's about to be our turn. This is a real battle against Fengdu Temple!" Wang Gang spoke, his voice filled with excitement.

"Can we be the match for Fengdu Temple?" Qiu Long sighed deeply. Fengdu Temple's strength was not like Yin Shen and Huangtian Temples; it was truly the first.

"Whatever, do our best. It's worth participating in this ten-temple competition!" Wang Gang laughed loudly and was quite carefree.

"Fengdu Temple isn't that scary. Even the strongest enemies have weaknesses! People didn't expect us to beat Huangtian Temple before, but now we've defeated it!" Mo Tian's eyes showed battle spirit and looked at the people from Huangtian Temple.

"Yes, if you have fear in your heart, then there's no chance!" Luo Tian looked at Mo Tian with appreciation. After this period of coexistence, he had a certain understanding of the small heavenly kings.

Among them, Luo Tian was most optimistic about Mo Tian. And he believed that Mo Tian's strength was the strongest among them.

"Two armies face each other, and the brave win! Don't be scared by the enemy's name! We also have a chance!"

"Follow the leader, everything is taken care of. Watch me lead you to show off and fly high!" Luo Tian laughed loudly and confidently walked towards the battlefield.

"The next battle is Lunzhuan Temple against Fengdu Temple!" As Luo Tian took a step, Shou Gui Wang's voice echoed on the battlefield.

Mo Tian, Wang Gang and Qiu Long looked at Luo Tian with contemplation as he strode confidently towards the battlefield.

"Haha, what's there to fear!" Qiu Long laughed loudly. Mo Tian and Wang Gang also smiled and followed Luo Tian.

The four of them flew onto the battlefield, immediately drawing people's attention.

"Lunzhuan Temple is up!"

"A dark horse! This competition's biggest winner isn't Fengdu Temple or Shiluo Temple, but Lunzhuan Temple!" People immediately started to talk.

"Good luck, Saint's Son! Get first place!" The disciples of Lunzhuan Temple shouted loudly and looked at Luo Tian on the high platform.

"It's finally over. We met Fengdu Temple, and this time it seems like Lunzhuan Temple will be ended!" However, people from other temples didn't believe in Lunzhuan Temple. Overall, the strength of Lunzhuan Temple's people was indeed a level lower than Fengdu Temple.

"Damned thing!" Three figures walked out of the crowd. They were the three people who had been killed by Luo Tian before.

The head of Huangtian Temple spent a price to get them back from Hei Bai and Bai Chang, and they were revived. They still had to participate in the competition. Although their results weren't ideal, they could still fight for a chance because there was also Yin Shen Temple. They still had hope.

"You just need to beat Yin Shen Temple, and we won't be the last. If you can't beat Yin Shen Temple, then your saint's son position is over!" The head of Huangtian Temple had said these words to Yi Jianren when he came out, and they still echoed in Yi Jianren's ears.

"I curse you to be beaten by Fengdu Temple!" Yi Jianren glared at the four of them standing on the battlefield with confidence and kept muttering.

However, Yi Jianren quickly became defeated because he knew that no matter how much he cursed, it couldn't change the fact that Lunzhuan Temple had defeated them.

He was reduced to just a soul, and this incident would spread to Huangtian Temple. His reputation would be ruined in the temple.

"It's a good spirit!" Ye Qiu smiled all the time and stood on the battlefield, looking at Luo Tian with a smile. His three people behind him also looked playfully at Luo Tian, thinking that among the Lunzhuan Temple's group, only Luo Tian was something, and the other three were not worth worrying about, even if Mo Tian had a moon eclipse eye.

Luo Tian frowned and looked at Ye Qiu's calm demeanor, showing contempt in his eyes. Luo Tian had seen many people, but when it came to calmness and showing off without effort, he only respected Jiang Nanxuan. This Ye Qiu was really ten thousand miles behind.

Luo Tian ignored Ye Qiu's words and didn't even bother to respond, which caused the three people behind Ye Qiu to be upset.

"Hey, our saint's son is talking to you. Why don't you answer?"

"You really think that defeating those people from Huangtian Temple makes you invincible?" A tall man, who looked like a bear, stood behind Ye Qiu and scolded Luo Tian.

"Start!" The man's words had just finished, and Shou Gui Wang announced the start of the battle.

"Talking nonsense. Can you talk to death?" Luo Tian flew up and rushed towards Ye Qiu's group, using the Yellow Spring Step to appear in front of the man. His red sword swung and struck the man's body.

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed, and the man kept retreating. Each time he stepped on the ground, it made a dull sound.

"Ah?" Luo Tian's eyes showed surprise. He had just hit the man hard, but he hadn't suffered any damage. This made Luo Tian curious.

Chapter 2186: Absolute Opposition Against Longyuan

"Betrayal, you actually ambushed me!" The man who looked like a bear was angry and his face turned red. He rushed towards Luo Tian.

Thunderous sounds echoed, and the man looked like a mountain. His body radiated powerful energy, making people doubt that they would be crushed to death if they were hit.

"Your opponent is me!" Qiu Long's eyes flashed with light. He stepped on the ground and rushed towards the man.

"Boom..." In an instant, Qiu Long and the man collided. There was no pretense; they looked like two mountains colliding, and a strong sound of collision echoed on the battlefield.

"Start!" Ye Qiu spoke softly to the people behind him, Bai Ming and another youth. He looked at Luo Tian and flew up with a graceful movement.

"Come on, the one with the moon eclipse eye. Come at me!" Bai Ming smiled and pointed his finger at Mo Tian, whose white eyes gave a sinister feeling.

"幽冥之眼，白冥！" Mo Tian's eyes slightly changed, and he spoke softly. His voice was filled with excitement; he had heard of Bai Ming's name before.

Their eyes met, and they immediately stood still. They seemed to have ignored the collision sounds of Qiu Long and the man.

"Come on!" Wang Gang raised his long sword and rushed towards the remaining youth.

The scene immediately became chaotic. Ye Qiu stood there, looking at Luo Tian, but Luo Tian ignored Ye Qiu and looked at Mo Tian's group. They were temporarily not in danger.

"Interesting, the configuration is similar. Qiu Long's senior also specializes in body strength, and this man also specializes in it."

"Moon Eclipse Eye, Ghost Eye!"

"Wang Gang's senior is a steady person. Although his offensive power isn't strong, he's the hardest to defeat!" The disciples of Lunzhuan Temple watched as they fought and whispered among themselves.

But everyone knew there was a gap in strength. They had only won because Luo Tian turned the tide.

"Kill..." Ye Qiu and Luo Tian spoke at the same time, moving towards each other. Their movements seemed slow but in an instant they were before each other. Black swords carried overwhelming battle spirit and cold killing intent, slashing towards Ye Qiu.

White light rose. Holy sword beams flashed from Ye Qiu's hands and directly met Luo Tian's Longyuan.

"Crack..." The sky darkened, the wind and clouds reversed. A clear collision sound rose in front of them. Thunderous lightning spread from the two absolute swords.

"Longyuan, Absolute Opposition!"
