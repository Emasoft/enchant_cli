Luo Tian had long prepared for this moment to serve as a concubine for the Azure Dragon Sect's Grand Master, but he had not expected to hear such a statement from Luo Tian. This one-time Grand Master of the sect did not seem to be as fond of women as the rumors suggested.

After speaking, Luo Tian's figure vanished into the grand hall and stood at the highest point of this building, gazing across the Azure Dragon Continent.

Looking upon half of the Azure Dragon Continent, with its towering mountains and cities, he recalled all that had transpired since arriving on the Azure Dragon Continent. A mountain breeze blew past, causing Luo Tian's robes to flutter.

Luo Tian felt a chill, an isolated cold. He had always believed himself strong, but recalling the memories of the Heaven Yuan Continent and the recollections within the Grand Master's mind of the Azure Dragon Sect, he felt an unusual coldness.

He touched his waist instinctively but found it empty—his soul-nourishing jade had vanished. Luo Tian's expression darkened: "Heaven Yuan Continent, wait for me. One day I will repay the debt to your continent and lead you out of the Heaven Yuan Continent. Yun Ting, wait for me. Even if you have been reborn, I will find you among the sea of people and grant you a lifetime of happiness!"

"Now that I have grasped the six Dao origins, with the experience and insights of the Azure Dragon Sect's Grand Master, it should be effortless to comprehend other Dao origins. What I need now is something capable of perceiving the origin. Ordinary Dao paths hold no interest for me; I must perceive the strongest, otherwise even reaching eight origins would not make me a match for other sects!"

"Additionally, I lack in martial techniques and weapons. Given my current status, this is even more crucial."

"Martial techniques are not a problem; with the Grand Master's memories, I need only select a few suitable ones."

"As for weapons, the Heavenly-grade Splitting Sky Spear might cause damage to an Earth Supreme, but it is insufficient for a Heaven Supreme," Luo Tian muttered quietly. That night, instead of training, Luo Tian spent the entire time contemplating his path forward.

The night passed unnoticed. Morning sunlight rose, illuminating Luo Tian's face and causing him to slowly open his eyes. He addressed the two female cultivators, one-source Supreme beings, who had been waiting obediently beneath the building: "Let disciple Sima Qiong come to me!"

The two female cultivators dared not delay. Their figures flickered, and a fragrant breeze carried Sima Qiong to Luo Tian's presence.

Sima Qiong felt a quiet confusion and complex emotions. He had maintained a good relationship with Luo Tian, but now that Luo Tian had been possessed, Sima Qiong felt a sense of pity. Once a radiant figure, Luo Tian had met this fate.

"Respect the Grand Master!" Two voices echoed as Sima Qiong and Zhang Qingsheng bowed to Luo Tian. Now, Zhang Qingsheng had become Sima Qiong's personal attendant, and Sima Qiong had also imparted his forging techniques to Zhang Qingsheng. Normally, Zhang Qingsheng assisted Sima Qiong with minor tasks; when Sima Qiong gambled, he was responsible for cleaning up after him.

Zhang Qingsheng observed Luo Tian's face, feeling uneasy. His expression remained devoid of emotion, and his voice carried a slight stiffness as he stood behind Sima Qiong.

"Transform this spear into an Imperial-grade long spear. There should be no problem, right?" Luo Tian smiled slightly as he looked at Sima Qiong's complex expression and placed the Splitting Sky Spear before them.

"Hmm?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's request, Sima Qiong displayed a brief confusion but dared not delay. He nodded in agreement.

"Don't worry, I won't let you work for nothing," Luo Tian chuckled and extended a hand. A Life and Death Origin surged from his palm, entering Sima Qiong's body. He also handed a vial of Life and Death Spring Water to Sima Qiong.

After returning to the Azure Dragon Sect, Sima Qiong had ascended to the five-source Supreme realm. He was just one step away from becoming a six-source Heaven Supreme. When Luo Tian's Life and Death Origin entered his body, Sima Qiong trembled.

When Sima Qiong accepted Luo Tian's water, his face changed dramatically. He bowed respectfully: "Respect the Ancestral Lord; I shall spare no effort to complete this task!"

"As for your attendant, he seems decent. I should also reward him!" Luo Tian extended a finger again, and chains of divine script surged from his palm into Zhang Qingsheng's Binding Soul Band. He extended a hand, and the golden Binding Soul Band transformed into divine script before appearing in Luo Tian's hands.

"Boom..." The Binding Soul Band shattered into waves of energy within Luo Tian's grasp, surprising Sima Qiong but leaving him with a nonchalant expression.

This Binding Soul Band was merely an ornament for Zhang Qingsheng. Sima Qiong had never activated it. After these days of interaction, Zhang Qingsheng was more like a friend and disciple to Sima Qiong.

Seeing his Binding Soul Band removed, Zhang Qingsheng showed no gratitude. He remained cold and stood there without acknowledging Luo Tian.

"What's wrong with your attendant? Why is he so cold towards me?" Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying authority as he addressed Sima Qiong.

"Ancestral Lord, please be calm. My attendant was once close to Luo Tian. Now that Luo Tian has been possessed by you, he feels some discomfort. I will definitely reprimand him thoroughly upon returning!" Sima Qiong dared not delay, unsure of the current Grand Master's temperament. He feared that if the Grand Master became enraged, he might kill Zhang Qingsheng and thus quickly pleaded for mercy.

"Indeed, loyal and righteous!" Luo Tian felt a slight warmth in his heart. His gaze softened toward Zhang Qingsheng.

This glance was perceived by Sima Qiong as a sign of approval, easing his heart slightly.

"Buzz..." The Soul-Subduing Cauldron appeared before Luo Tian. A translucent jade fire radiated from it, and countless herbs were thrown into the cauldron. Within moments, a fragrant aroma filled the air.

"Condense..." Luo Tian's current strength allowed him to refine a ninth-grade elixir effortlessly. Within moments, a ninth-grade elixir appeared in his hand.

He waved his hand, and the elixir transformed into a streak of light before Zhang Qingsheng. His voice echoed in Zhang Qingsheng's ears: "Because of your loyalty and righteousness, take this elixir. It will elevate you to the one-source Supreme realm. Moreover, I promise to provide all elixirs for your ascension from one-source to five-source!"

Zhang Qingsheng furrowed his brows slightly but immediately displayed astonishment upon seeing the floating elixir. His gaze shifted to Luo Tian with disbelief, and his body trembled slightly as he looked at him.

Luo Tian remained seated with an imposing demeanor, subtly shaking his head. The gesture was so subtle that even Sima Qiong did not notice.

"Yes, thank you, Grand Master!" Zhang Qingsheng regained his composure and bowed respectfully to Luo Tian. Sima Qiong was stunned, puzzled by the drastic change in Zhang Qingsheng's demeanor.

Chapter 784: Reopening Feng Shen Continent

Chapter 784: Reopening Feng Shen Continent

At the Azure Dragon Sect's residence, Luo Tian's dwelling resembled a small town. It was quiet and still; all attendants and disciples were apprehensive, unsure of the Grand Master's temperament. Yet within Luo Tian's vast chamber, there had been a continuous sound of hammering over these days.

"Roar..." Seven days had passed since Sima Qiong arrived at Luo Tian's location. These seven days had exhausted him, but seeing the black dragon-like Splitting Sky Spear before him, Sima Qiong's face displayed ecstatic joy.

After seven days of drawing countless resources from the Azure Dragon Sect, Luo Tian had finally elevated the Splitting Sky Spear to Imperial-grade status under Sima Qiong's forging.

"It's done! From today, I am also an Imperial-grade artificer!" Sima Qiong laughed heartily, his eyes filled with satisfaction as he gazed at the Splitting Sky Spear.

Zhang Qingsheng wiped sweat from his forehead, his face also carrying a hint of joy as he stood behind Sima Qiong.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's figure appeared before them, silencing Sima Qiong's laughter.

"Good. These days have been hard on you. Return and cultivate the Life and Death Origin to ascend to Heaven Supreme!" Luo Tian spoke softly, extending his hand to grasp the black long dragon. He felt the Splitting Sky Spear's power had increased significantly, and his face was equally satisfied.

Sima Qiong bowed respectfully and led Zhang Qingsheng back to his residence.

"Grand Master, it's time to enter Feng Shen Continent. We must begin our plan!" As Luo Tian had just grasped the Splitting Sky Spear, Sha Cangmang's voice echoed in his mind through the Azure Dragon Sect's token.

"Is it time to begin?" Luo Tian's eyes also displayed anticipation. He instructed the two female attendants who had followed him to head to Feng Shen Continent first, while he returned to his residence to refine the Splitting Sky Spear.

...

In the starry expanse beyond Feng Shen Continent, Sha Cangmang and four Heaven Supreme beings displayed excitement as they gazed at Feng Shen Continent. Behind them were over a dozen six-source Supreme beings and Azure Dragon Sect elders, as well as several one-source Supreme attendants wearing Binding Soul Bands.

At this moment, Feng Shen Continent was no longer the same as when the ranking battle had begun. The entire continent seemed shrouded in a gray mist, with powerful array forces isolating Feng Shen Continent's aura from the outside world.

"Respect the Grand Master!" A seven-source Heaven Supreme who had participated in sealing the Azure Dragon Continent appeared before Sha Cangmang, bowing respectfully with a touch of excitement.

"Your years of hardship have been worth it. After today, you will realize your efforts were all worthwhile!" Sha Cangmang smiled as he addressed the seven-source Supreme.

"White Tiger Sect, Vermilion Phoenix Sect, and Black Tortoise Sect should not have discovered it!" Sha Cangmang spoke again to the seven-source Supreme.

"Grand Master, rest assured. Our years of preparation have been flawless. Once inside Feng Shen Continent, the other three sects will not detect it!" The seven-source Supreme's eyes reflected boundless confidence as he spoke.

"Indeed, this person truly considers himself a Grand Master. How arrogant!" One of the seven-source Supreme beings behind Sha Cangmang spoke, one of the four seven-source Heaven Supremes who had participated in the Grand Master's possession.

"Indeed, it seems necessary to show him a lesson. Otherwise, such a person is hard to control!" The other three also concurred.

After observing for several days, Sha Cangmang and the four had confirmed that this Luo Tian was not the Grand Master. According to legend, the Grand Master was a man who loved women, but Luo Tian had not touched any of the thousands of young and beautiful female disciples sent to him. This convinced them that the one who had possessed Luo Tian's body was definitely not the Grand Master.

"Let's delay a little. Don't be too harsh. Once we enter the Supreme Altar and grasp its secrets, we can discuss how to deal with it!" Sha Cangmang spoke, his gaze revealing a touch of coldness.

"Buzz..." A fluctuation in spiritual energy was felt. The two female attendants Luo Tian had sent ahead to Feng Shen Continent appeared in people's sight.

The moment the two female attendants appeared, their expressions trembled. Facing so many people and high-ranking figures of the Azure Dragon Sect, they felt some tension.

"Where is your master? He's late compared to the expected time. Punishment!" One of the seven-source Supreme beings spoke, his spiritual power hand sweeping toward the two female attendants and grabbing them before him.

"Indeed, quite attractive. That fellow didn't use them. From now on, you two will follow me!" The seven-source Supreme spoke, his gaze filled with greed as he reached toward the two female attendants' prominent peaks.

The two female attendants gazed at the seven-source Supreme's aged face, feeling a sense of revulsion. Though they knew Luo Tian had been possessed, at least his appearance was youthful. The current Heaven Supreme made them unable to accept.

Yet before the seven-source Supreme, they could not resist in the slightest. Their eyes reflected despair as they trembled and stood still, awaiting the old man's hand.

"My people, can you touch them?" Just as the old man's hands were about to reach them, Luo Tian's cold voice echoed from the void.

"Roar..." A dragon roar was heard. The black Splitting Sky Spear burst from the void, like a primordial ancient dragon flying from antiquity. It instantly appeared before the old man's hands, interrupting his actions.

"Buzz..." The displacement power spread across the two female attendants. In an instant, they appeared thousands of feet away from the old man. Luo Tian's figure also appeared in people's sight, his eyes filled with a cold expression.

The icy spear tip like an icy fang bit into the seven-source Supreme's hand, drawing a streak of blood.

"Die!" The seven-source Supreme who had long wanted to discipline Luo Tian displayed a cold expression. He extended his hand, seven sources of power surging forth and forming a massive hand to strike Luo Tian and the three others.

"It seems we need someone's death to create a deterrent!" Luo Tian's eyes also reflected coldness. Seeing Sha Cangmang and the others made no move to stop him, he smiled coldly while his aura surged forth. He punched with his bare body without using any origin power.

The thunderous sound echoed as Luo Tian's fist collided with the seven-source Supreme's spiritual hand. The spiritual hand shattered.

"The Azure Dragon Body is truly terrifying!" The other three seven-source Supreme beings displayed shock. On that day, when Luo Tian had shattered the four of them with his body and broken their spiritual network, they knew he was no easy opponent. However, at that time, the four had just used the altar's array and were exhausted from refining Luo Tian's body. Their strength was only at three-tenths of their peak.

Now, seeing Luo Tian use his body to shatter the seven-source Supreme's spiritual hand, the other three's eyes flickered slightly.

After shattering the old man's spiritual hand with one punch, Luo Tian did not stop. He took a step forward, and as his foot landed, a violent aura surged from his body outward. It formed a spiritual origin whirlpool and rushed toward the old man.

As the whirlpool moved, Luo Tian's figure also appeared before the seven-source Supreme. He punched again, lightning flashing and green energy spreading. The overwhelming power of heaven and earth surged from his fist toward the old man.

The old man's eyes narrowed, sensing the terrifying pressure within Luo Tian's fist. He dared not be careless and raised his right hand, seven sources of power mixed with heavenly energy to press against Luo Tian's fist.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed again. After one punch, Luo Tian stood still with a cold smile, gazing at the old man.

The old man, however, seemed as if struck by a mountain. His entire body was swept up in fierce winds and retreated backward, his robes torn into pieces by the terrifying pressure. His hands emitted a series of cracking sounds as blood spewed from his body.

"You dare to die!" The old man shouted while retreating, causing the surrounding Heaven Supreme beings to display strange expressions.

Almost as soon as the old man spoke, his three seven-source Supreme companions' auras surged skyward. The two six-source Supreme beings under the old man also displayed coldness, drawing their weapons and stepping forward toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian showed no fear. He waved his hand, creating a vast轮回 channel that echoed with a humming sound. Six Dao origins surged into the two six-source Supreme beings, causing them to tremble in shock.

Luo Tian's two female attendants displayed astonishment. Luo Tian's current external identity was still the Grand Master, but seeing the four seven-source Supreme beings' attitude, they realized it was not simple. They had not shown any respect for Luo Tian and even attacked him, indicating the situation was more complex than they had thought.

Even more shocking for them was that Luo Tian, a six-source Supreme being, had not feared the seven-source Supreme and even pushed him back.

"Brotherly affection? Want to attack me together?" Luo Tian held the Splitting Sky Spear in his hand, displaying no fear as he gazed at the three seven-source Heaven Supremes surrounding him. His overwhelming aura surged forth, and spiritual energy converged toward him.

"Enough! Use that strength to enter Feng Shen Continent. Everyone, stop!" Sha Cangmang displayed impatience and spoke to them.

Upon hearing Sha Cangmang's words, the three old men slowly returned behind him, their faces carrying a touch of killing intent toward Luo Tian.

"It's my fault for being late. But you attacked my subordinates. This isn't over!" Luo Tian's face remained cold, his body transforming into a streak of light as he rushed toward the old man who had just returned to position.

Chapter 785: Entering Feng Shen

Chapter 785: Entering Feng Shen

Beyond the Feng Shen Continent, in the starry expanse guarded by the Azure Dragon Sect, Luo Tian surged like a storm toward the seven-source Supreme who had just returned to the group.

"My people are not yours to toy with!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed through the stars. His figure had already appeared before the old man, and he punched.

At the moment the seven-source Supreme saw Luo Tian take a step forward, his entire soul trembled. His spiritual power surged forth again, forming a green shield before him.

As the green shield formed, the old man's body immediately retreated. His eyes carried a touch of anger as he gazed at Luo Tian. He had already seen Luo Tian's strength before and knew he was no match for him.

At the same time, Luo Tian's fist collided with the green shield formed by the old man. Thunderous sounds echoed again in the endless starry expanse.

With thunderous sound, Luo Tian's figure appeared before the retreating old man again. His face was cold.

"One punch... two punches..." As the seven-source Supreme kept retreating, Luo Tian's fists struck him repeatedly.

The old man's chest, just recovered, collapsed again. His face showed shock. At this moment, he deeply regretted having been the first to provoke Luo Tian.

The old man kept retreating, his face displaying humiliation. A series of punches appeared before him.

"Grand Master, stop!" Sha Cangmang's face turned furious as he spoke to Luo Tian. His gaze had become cold.

Luo Tian, however, seemed not to have heard. He grabbed the old man's arm and pulled it forcefully.

"Pu..." Under this pull, the old man's entire arm was torn off, blood splattering across the stars.

"Take your arm. Don't provoke me!" Luo Tian sneered, gazing at the old man. He unleashed his spiritual power to crush the old man's arm.

"Fool!" The three seven-source Supreme beings accompanying the old man displayed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were a monster.

No one had expected Luo Tian to dare push the old man so far in front of Sha Cangmang. Everyone's gaze toward Luo Tian carried a touch of caution and even admiration for his actions, clearly showing he had no regard for Sha Cangmang.

Sha Cangmang's face turned iron-gray. His gaze flickered with killing intent before he suppressed his anger and spoke softly: "Enough! Prepare to enter Feng Shen Continent!"

The amputated old man returned silently to his position. At this moment, he was at his most miserable, pale-faced and covered in blood. Different parts of his body were indented, clearly severely injured.

Sha Cangmang took out a pill and placed it in the old man's hand. He then extended his hand, and the blood mist before Luo Tian gradually coalesced into a withered arm. It landed in Sha Cangmang's hand, and he reattached it to the old man's shoulder.

Luo Tian stood calmly before his two female attendants, as if nothing had happened. His confidence stemmed from knowing these people needed him—more accurately, they needed him to lead them into the Supreme Altar.

The two female attendants gazed at Luo Tian with complex expressions. They had not expected Luo Tian to clash with the Azure Dragon Sect's elders, even Grand Masters, over them.

Everyone's gaze toward Luo Tian carried a touch of fear. The old man's strength was evident to all—seven-source Heaven Supreme, renowned in the Four Sacred Stars. Yet he had suffered a crushing defeat at Luo Tian's hands. In people's eyes, unless the three seven-source Supreme beings joined forces or Sha Cangmang intervened, no one could subdue Luo Tian.

"Enough. Let's begin!" Sha Cangmang addressed the seven-source Supreme who had been guarding Feng Shen Continent, indicating he should enter.

"Jian De, let's set this aside for now. Once we reach the Supreme Altar, the four of us will join forces to subdue this boy!"

"Indeed. Hurting you is equivalent to hurting us. But now, everything must prioritize the Supreme Altar; otherwise, the Grand Master wouldn't have acted so recklessly!" The three seven-source Supreme beings' faces bore coldness as they whispered to the wounded old man.

After Jian De reattached his arm, he remained silent. His heart feared Luo Tian; the look in Luo Tian's eyes had been terrifying, like a madman. The old man was certain that if he provoked further, and it weren't for Sha Cangmang's presence, Luo Tian might have killed him.

"Buzz..." As these people were lost in thought, the seven-source Supreme guarding Feng Shen Continent's hands moved swiftly. His spiritual power formed divine seals and struck toward the starry expanse outside Feng Shen Continent.

The spiritual seals struck against the barrier surrounding Feng Shen Continent, emitting a faint thunderous sound. Finally, divine seals formed a gate before people's eyes.

Luo Tian gazed at Feng Shen Continent. He recalled the Azure Dragon Sect's Grand Master's knowledge of Feng Shen Continent. After the war with the Ming Domain ended, Feng Shen Continent had appeared in people's sight.

Initially, people thought it was just an ordinary star. No one paid much attention or explored it. But as time passed, Feng Shen Continent had become mysterious. Every year for a period of time, it was normal.

But once that period passed, the entire Feng Shen Continent would be shrouded in gray mist and emit mournful sounds. Anything passing over Feng Shen Continent's sky would be sucked into it, never to return.

The reason the four sects had chosen Feng Shen Continent for their ranking battle was to take advantage of its normal period. Otherwise, the ranking battle would not have been held on Feng Shen Continent.

"Grand Master, hurry in. This gate can only last half a moment. After half a moment, it will take months to enter again!" The seven-source Supreme guarding Feng Shen Continent interrupted their thoughts and spoke to Sha Cangmang.

"Go!" Sha Cangmang did not delay. He waved his hand, and displacement power rose beneath everyone's feet, making them vanish from their original position.

"Buzz..." In an instant, Luo Tian and the others appeared on Feng Shen Continent. A look of shock crossed Luo Tian's face.

At this moment, Feng Shen Continent was completely different from what he had seen before.

A gray mist enveloped the entire continent, even affecting spiritual awareness. As Luo Tian extended his spiritual sense, it vanished instantly, as if it had never been released. His mind ached.

"Don't project your spiritual sense outward; these mists can devour it!" The Grand Master's words made everyone realize the truth, and they became cautious.

"This place has no path. We only have one month to find the Supreme Altar; if we don't find it within a month, we must return. Follow me closely and don't make mistakes. Don't touch anything; even I might perish here!" Sha Cangmang's face bore a serious expression as he instructed them.

Sha Cangmang's words were directed at Luo Tian and his subordinates. Clearly, the Azure Dragon Sect had explored Feng Shen Continent multiple times before, but only Luo Tian and these two female attendants were entering for the first time.

After speaking, Sha Cangmang did not wait for others. Time was pressing. He took a step into the gray mist, and others dared not delay but followed behind Sha Cangmang toward Feng Shen Continent's depths.

They rushed through the gray mist, circling around. Although Sha Cangmang had been here before, he was still cautious.

Luo Tian followed silently behind the group. His two female attendants displayed tension, often glancing around. They were even more uncertain about the sealed Feng Shen Continent that terrified Sha Cangmang and others.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, Luo Tian suddenly saw a five-source Supreme ahead of him displaying confusion and rushing into the mist. After walking several feet, he stopped.

Before anyone could warn him, this five-source Supreme, who was strong in the Four Sacred Stars, shattered with a thunderous sound. Not even his soul remained; he turned into a pile of white bones before their eyes.

"Don't look around. Follow me closely and don't glance elsewhere. I'll say it one more time!" Sha Cangmang's authoritative voice echoed in their ears.

"The furthest we can go is thirty thousand feet. Beyond that, the mist will be denser. At that point, it'll rely on the Grand Master!" Sha Cangmang spoke, his gaze turning to the end of the group—Luo Tian.

"Ah..." A girl's cry echoed. The female attendant before Luo Tian displayed fear, then a strange expression as she looked at another female attendant. Her laughter sent chills down people's spines.

Seeing her companion was abnormal, the normal female attendant moved to hide behind Luo Tian. But in an instant, the female attendant's body froze. A withered hand grasped her neck.

"Possession!" Luo Tian instantly thought of a possibility. His body transformed into a green eagle, lightning flashing around him as he punched the possessed female attendant.

"Crack..." The sound of bones breaking echoed. Luo Tian's face showed no relaxation, his eyes flashing with light. Green fire burst from his body and entered the female attendant's.

A scream echoed, a gray mist emerging from the female attendant's body. It formed an old figure and then dispersed into people's sight.

Chapter 786: Purple Extreme Demon Eyes

Chapter 786: Purple Extreme Demon Eyes

In the gray mist of Feng Shen Continent.

A scream echoed. A gray mist emerged from the female attendant under Luo Tian's command, and his face darkened.

As the gray mist emerged, his subordinate also lost vitality. Her body rapidly aged, her beauty turning to white hair and becoming a pile of bones.

"Ha! Didn't listen to the Grand Master's advice. You deserved it!" The seven-source Supreme elders smiled, secretly mocking.

Feeling their mocking gaze, Luo Tian's eyes flashed like lightning as he scanned the group.

"Follow me!" Luo Tian sighed and spoke to the remaining female attendant. He continued following behind the group.

The female attendant was terrified beyond measure. Her neck still felt a chill, and a purple bruise remained on her white neck. She dared not look around again, tightly following Luo Tian's back, her vision only seeing his back.

They walked for three days to complete the thirty thousand feet Sha Cangmang had mentioned. Their speed was a crawl compared to their usual flying and moving through the sky.

Although they moved slowly, two four-source Supreme beings were consumed by the gray mist.

"We've arrived! This is the furthest we've ever gone. Going deeper, even I would risk losing my way!" Sha Cangmang spoke to Luo Tian and the others.

"Is it my turn?" Luo Tian's eyes bore a serious expression. He gazed at the densest gray mist before him, stepping to the front of the group.

People's faces also showed anticipation. They knew only Luo Tian, who had inherited the Grand Master's legacy, could find the correct path to the Supreme Altar.

A faint sorrowful aura arose in Luo Tian's heart, causing his brows to furrow slightly. He did not know where this sorrow came from.

Unlike others, who felt the dense mist carried endless danger, Luo Tian felt no sense of danger at all. Even when Sha Cangmang warned not to look around, he had instinctively glanced around but nothing like what happened to his subordinates and the three dead people.

However, Luo Tian was disappointed. He had no other discoveries. What he saw was still emptiness.

"Grand Master, hurry!" One of the seven-source Supreme beings urged, his face showing impatience.

Luo Tian did not want to argue. His hands moved swiftly, and lightning-origin power surged from his palm. Thunderbolts appeared around him.

In an instant, these thunderbolts flowed into Luo Tian's eyes. They moved within his eyes and eventually formed a strange seal, imprinted on his eyes. His eyes turned purple.

"Purple Extreme Demon Eyes!" Sha Cangmang displayed a touch of admiration, gazing at Luo Tian's purple eyes.

"It is the unique way to refine one's eyes by a Grand Master!" Others displayed excitement, gazing at Luo Tian.

Purple eyes were unusually clear. At this moment, Luo Tian appeared somewhat eerie.

Seeing Luo Tian's gaze, people trembled as if he had seen through them entirely.

Luo Tian did not care about others' gazes. His eyes gazed into the distance, his face displaying shock. At this moment, Feng Shen Continent was clear to him.

In his vision, the continent's center revealed an ancient altar. A winding path led toward it. The altar was old and weathered, emitting a strange aura. This powerful aura seemed to belong to no four sacred stars. It was strong and mysterious, with divine seals flowing continuously on the altar.

"That's the Supreme aura!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. More astonishing was the gray mist on both sides of the path leading to the Supreme Altar.

At this moment, the densest gray mist was unusually clear to Luo Tian.

"What is this? It's not mist at all! It's residual souls!" Luo Tian muttered quietly. In his vision, these residual souls seemed like two opposing enemies, devouring each other across the path.

"Ten Yuan Continent's aura!" Luo Tian gazed at the residual souls, puzzled as to why he felt the Ten Yuan Continent's aura on one of them.

Additionally, several terrifying fluctuations emerged from within the residual souls. They seemed like commanders, powerful enough to make Luo Tian tremble. Even more so than the strongest among them—Sha Cangmang.

"Nine-source! Definitely nine-source!" Luo Tian confirmed these terrifying fluctuations were definitely from a nine-source strength. Yet they remained residual souls, without consciousness.

"What did you see?" Sha Cangmang's gaze carried anticipation as he looked at Luo Tian.

"A altar, a path! And countless residual souls!" Luo Tian spoke, his purple eyes gazing at Sha Cangmang. Purple light spread, concealing what Luo Tian was thinking.

"Indeed, that is the Supreme Altar. When the four sects' Grand Masters were eight-source Supremes, they explored Feng Shen Continent. After exiting it, they achieved nine sources and created the Purple Extreme Demon Eyes to prepare for another entry. However, due to some unknown reason, they never went in and eventually perished within the Azure Dragon Sect.

Sha Cangmang's words left Luo Tian puzzled. Knowing he had consumed the Grand Master's soul, he understood that the Grand Master had indeed exited Feng Shen Continent. But where did these countless residual souls with Ten Yuan Continent's aura come from?

"Even if everyone on the Ten Yuan Continent died, it would not be enough for a tenth of these residual souls!"

"War with the Ming Domain! Only when the Ten Yuan Continent had not yet shattered could it have so many people!" Luo Tian could think of no other way to explain this. He could only conclude it was the war with the Ming Domain.

Yet another question remained: why were so many residual souls appearing in Feng Shen Continent? If someone with great power had moved these souls here, how powerful would that person be? This exceeded Luo Tian's understanding.
