"Damn it!" Jinyang Xi and his companions' faces darkened, their expressions as gloomy as if bleeding blood. They watched Luo Tian and Sun Meng escape from the Mortal Domain, but it was already too late to chase them—after all, they dared not leave the Mortal Domain.

They felt humiliated beyond redemption. Each thought of how things had ended like this, and the realization that the ancient tribes would surely discuss this in the coming days filled them with unease.

Chapter 1536: Breaking Free from the Mortal Domain

"Where is our ancient king's heir?" As Jinyang Xi and his companions' faces darkened, a voice as old as the stars echoed from above. The provisional king of the Fei Clan appeared before them.

"Grand Elder, our ancient king's heir... is dead!" Fan Jingyu trembled on his face, gazing at the elder.

"What!" Upon hearing Fan Jingyu's words, the provisional king of the Fei Clan nearly fainted.

The last time Yu Fanti had died, the Fei Clan had spent immense resources to revive him. Now, only a few years after his revival, he was slain again—this would be unbearable for anyone. The Fei Clan still had methods to revive Yu Fanti, but the cost was unbearable even for a royal clan. The last revival had already pushed them to their limit.

"Out of all of you, surrounding one human, and yet he killed you?" The provisional king's face darkened as he surveyed Jinyang Xi and Xue Shengfei.

"Has our ancient king's heir also perished?" As the provisional king's words echoed, another deep voice responded. The provisional king of the Hun Tian Clan arrived, gazing at the pale-faced group.

"Yes!" Jinyang Xi and his companions felt ashamed but nodded, gazing at the two provisional kings.

"Human clan, you've gone too far!" The two provisional kings roared, and the stars trembled with their fury.

"Unite our people and strike back at the human clan!" The two provisional kings roared into the stars, their voices echoing through the Nine Realms.

As the two provisional kings' roars echoed, the Nine Realms trembled again. Whether human clan or ancient tribes, all were shaken into tension.

"What's going on? This must be the roar of a provisional epoch master, otherwise it wouldn't have come from the Mortal Domain!" The great sanctuaries of the human clan, upon hearing the two provisional kings' roars, all became chaotic.

But soon after, they were filled with tension. They hadn't expected the ancient tribes to start another war so soon.

Though the human clan had developed poorly in recent years, without Ji Jiu You, Dongbo Xin, and Gu Tianshu, they still wouldn't be the match for the ancient tribes. At that moment, all great sanctuaries and clans were in panic.

Not only did the human clan tremble, but so did the ancient tribes. They hadn't expected another war to begin so soon. However, a battle-ready roar echoed from the Mortal Domain.

"It must be that the provisional kings have enough confidence to counter the human clan's three!" The ancient tribes believed their provisional kings had found a way to deal with Ji Jiu You, Dongbo Xin, and Gu Tianshu.

"Are you really going to start another war?" As the two provisional kings roared, a deep voice echoed from the entrance of the Mortal Domain, causing both provisional kings to tremble.

"Ji Jiu You!" The two provisional kings' faces darkened as they gazed at the entrance of the Mortal Domain. They remembered how one spear had subdued them and their dozens of epoch peak masters.

One of the two provisional kings was once an epoch peak master. He had felt Ji Jiu You's power firsthand. Even though he was once an epoch peak master, in front of Ji Jiu You, he still felt like a commoner.

"Unfathomable!" This was the evaluation of the provisional kings of the ancient tribes for Ji Jiu You. Compared to Gu Tianshu's invincibility and Dongbo Xin's fierce strength, Ji Jiu You, a living fossil-level master, was the most feared by the ancient tribes. After all, Ji Jiu You had lived for too long.

"Ji Jiu You! Your human clan trespassed into our Mortal Domain and killed two of our ancient kings' heirs. This matter must be explained to us!" The provisional king of the Fei Clan and the provisional king of the Hun Tian Clan shouted into the void, addressing the entrance of the Mortal Domain.

Their words spread across the Nine Realms, causing an uproar. Whether it was the ancient tribes or the human clan or beasts of war, all were shocked.

"How could this be? Our ancient kings' heirs are so powerful. How could they be killed by someone!" The people of the Hun Tian Clan immediately recognized their clan's provisional king's voice, eyes filled with disbelief.

"How could this be? Our ancient kings' heirs had just been revived!" The people of the Fei Clan, on the other hand, wore expressions of sorrow as they cried out.

"Again, it's the human clan. Who exactly is it? Didn't we say that humans couldn't enter the Mortal Domain!" The ancient tribes roared.

"We had agreed that the ancient tribes couldn't enter the Nine Realms, but we never said humans couldn't enter the Mortal Domain!"

"We human prodigies entered the Mortal Domain, and you killed us. This has already violated our agreement. We didn't come to find you, but you've started making excuses!" Ji Jiu You's voice echoed across the Nine Realms.

"It must be Luo Tian! Definitely!" On the Four Sacred Star Domains' Tianyuan Continent, Xu Liziyi and others wore expressions of shock. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to cause such a commotion after just a trip into the Mortal Domain.

"Is Luo Tian in danger?" Though people on the Tianyuan Continent were excited, they also worried about Luo Tian's safety.

What was an ancient king's heir? They were no ordinary people. Killing two of them would surely cost Luo Tian a heavy price.

"Luo Tian?" The descendants of the epoch masters who had just awakened in the human clan's great sanctuaries were all surprised, instantly elevating Luo Tian to their level.

"Making excuses!" Upon hearing Ji Jiu You's words, the two provisional kings almost spat blood. However, Ji Jiu You's words also made them regain their composure.

"This matter must be explained to us, or we will unite with other royal clans and strike back at the human clan!" The two provisional kings declared strongly.

"You dare to step into the human clan's domain, we'll kill one for each!" Dongbo Xin's voice echoed from the Divine Beast Domain.

The two provisional kings fell silent. The words of Ji Jiu You and Dongbo Xin had completely silenced them.

Though they were honored and powerful within the ancient tribes, being provisional kings with immense power, they couldn't start a war on their own—they had to consult other provisional kings.

"Human clan, you've gone too far. We can't bear this!" As the two provisional kings fell silent, several voices echoed again from within the Mortal Domain.

"Another ancient tribe has promoted a provisional king!" The human clan was shocked. They hadn't expected the ancient tribes to develop so quickly, adding more provisional kings.

At the same time, people felt anxious. In the past, the human clan had resisted the ancient tribes' invasion only because of Gu Tianshu's suppression. But if Gu Tianshu could suppress three provisional kings, what about four? Five? There was always a limit. If the ancient tribes truly produced multiple provisional kings, how would the human clan counter? Though it seemed peaceful now, the ancient tribes still harbored hatred toward the human clan. If dozens of provisional kings came, how would the human clan resist?

"Should we fight, we'll accompany you!" Gu Tianshu's voice echoed from the Fire Domain. His tone still carried dominance.

Hearing the human clan's three masters' responses, the ancient tribes' provisional kings fell silent. They had no confidence to fully resolve Ji Jiu You and the others. Their anger stemmed from the fact that two of their ancient kings' heirs had perished, which was a blow to them.

"Centuries later, we'll declare war on the human clan again. Then we'll settle it once and for all!" The ancient tribes' provisional kings transmitted thoughts secretly before speaking.

"A century? That should be enough!" Upon hearing the ancient tribes' provisional kings' declaration of war, Ji Jiu You, Dongbo Xin, and Gu Tianshu didn't respond.

"A century!" The entire Nine Realms of humans and ancient tribes all murmured. A hundred years was enough for Luo Tian and others to grow into provisional epoch masters.

In contrast, the ancient tribes' ancient kings' heirs would also mature into provisional kings. That was when true great times would begin, and perhaps someone could emerge in that era to become an ultimate being.

All the great sanctuaries' prodigies and descendants of epoch masters had battle lust in their eyes. A hundred years seemed long, but for cultivators it was extremely short.

"Time is tight!" All the great sanctuaries, the ancient tribes' prodigies and ancient kings' heirs all felt the urgency. They had a sense that in a hundred years, it would be the real great battle. Whoever achieved enlightenment could suppress the current era.

"Breaking free!" Sun Meng carried Luo Tian out of the Mortal Domain. As they exited, Sun Meng heard the provisional kings' roars and Ji Jiu You's conversation.

Luo Tian, upon exiting, could no longer hold on. His eyes dimmed and he collapsed onto Sun Meng's back, unconscious.

The two ancient tribes' guards at the Mortal Domain entrance and the human clan's guards were naturally ignored by Sun Meng. He charged forward, heading toward the Tianyuan Continent.

"Stay strong! We're almost home!" Sun Meng was also in a bad state, but he kept encouraging Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." A green aura radiated from Luo Tian's back, slowly healing the wounds that had been erased.

"Indeed, a Reincarnation Body. This flesh body is truly变态!" Sun Meng felt Luo Tian healing himself and sighed deeply, then moved swiftly toward the Tianyuan Continent.

Time passed slowly. Sun Meng flew for nearly three hours, his face gradually turning pale. After all, he had also endured several battles and suffered heavy injuries. Though better than Luo Tian, he was still exhausted.

"Let me down!" As Sun Meng struggled to continue, Luo Tian's voice echoed in his ears, making Sun Meng sigh deeply.

Luo Tian wore a bitter smile. His back's flesh had slowly healed, and seeing the sweat dripping from Sun Meng's face, he felt a pang of心疼.

"Uh-huh," Sun Meng nodded. He also felt Luo Tian on his back growing heavier, so he carefully placed him down.

Chapter 1537: Reinforcement

Luo Tian fell from Sun Meng's back, but his face was still pale. Though the injuries seemed to have healed, Luo Tian had still suffered heavy damage. His spirit was weak, and curse power still lingered on his spirit, causing him unbearable pain.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian and Sun Meng supported each other with smiles, slowing their pace as they flew toward the Tianyuan Continent.

"Stay strong. We're almost home!" They encouraged each other, slowly flying toward the Tianyuan Continent.

"Buzz..." As they flew through space, a wave of brilliant light shot toward them.

"Someone's ahead!" A series of anxious voices echoed beneath the stars, making Luo Tian and Sun Meng's faces slightly change.

"Luo Tian!" Then, the light flashed, appearing before Luo Tian and Sun Meng. They both sighed in relief, their faces showing a hint of smiles.

In the view, several figures flew swiftly to Luo Tian's side and helped him up.

"Everyone, it's been a while!" Luo Tian smiled at the familiar figures in his view and spoke weakly.

The people were none other than Luo Tian's friends and family on the Tianyuan Continent. Upon hearing that the ancient kings' heirs had been killed, people guessed it was Luo Tian. Moreover, they heard from the provisional kings of the ancient tribes and Ji Jiu You's conversation that Luo Tian hadn't been captured by the ancient tribes.

Luo Tian was heavily injured, and people worried about any further misfortune for him in the human clan. Though Luo Tian was powerful, he had many enemies. Although the ancient tribes' invasion had temporarily restored peace to the human clan, people's hearts were still guarded. In the past, Luo Tian had resisted the nine saints of the Mortal Domain and died, but some sanctuaries still didn't appreciate him and had attacked Luo Tian.

If someone with ill intentions guessed, it wouldn't be hard to figure out who had caused such a commotion. After all, how many people in the Nine Realms could kill an ancient kings' heir?

After discussing among themselves, the people of the Tianyuan Continent split into several groups to search for Luo Tian. The group that met Luo Tian was Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, Xu Lizi, and Sun Kemin, along with a group of prodigies.

"Brother, you really are amazing! Once we get back to the Tianyuan Continent, let's talk for three days and nights. Tell us how you killed those ancient kings' heirs!" Zheng Xin helped Luo Tian up, looking at the two of them who were in a terrible state. He knew people's guesses weren't off.

"Yes, Luo Tian, what have you been doing for the past twenty years!" Xu Lizi and others spoke as well. The younger generation looked at Luo Tian with respect, their eyes glowing.

"Uncle Zheng, stop talking so much. Can't you see my father is heavily injured?" Luo Li looked at Zheng Xin, who was talking endlessly, and spoke softly. He approached Sun Meng and helped him up.

As Luo Tian listened to Zheng Xin and Gu Lei's endless chatter, he felt dizzy. His head felt large.

"Damn it, can't you stop talking? Take me back quickly! If you keep dragging this out, I'll spit blood!" Luo Tian roared at Zheng Xin and others, as if using all his strength.

"Uh..." Zheng Xin and the others looked at Luo Tian's pale face, sweat dripping from his forehead. They hadn't seen Luo Tian so injured in a long time and imagined what kind of battle could have wounded him this severely.

"Let's go!" They knew it wasn't the time for idle chatter. Supporting Luo Tian and Sun Meng, they flew toward the Tianyuan Continent.

With their help, the speed was much faster. In just one hour, Luo Tian saw the image of the Tianyuan Continent and felt a sense of nostalgia. It had been over twenty years, but the Tianyuan Continent hadn't changed at all.

"Finally home!" Luo Tian spoke weakly. Throughout the journey, both Luo Tian and Sun Meng's appearances improved.

"Yes, we're home!" Sun Meng's eyes were filled with tears. Compared to Luo Tian, she had been away longer. When she and Gu Qianxue left, Luo Li was still a child, but now he had grown into an adult and become a prodigy of the new generation.

"Buzz..." As they relaxed slightly, a golden sword beam shot from space. It carried strong killing intent and stabbed down at Luo Tian, who was surrounded by the group.

The sword beam's speed was too fast. The group immediately felt a strong crisis and their faces darkened.

"Still someone attacked us!"

"A strike from an epoch peak master!"

Zheng Xin moved swiftly, his late epoch level power bursting out. He appeared in front of Luo Tian with a massive hammer and swung it fiercely at the golden sword beam.

"Open!" Zheng Xin roared. The green hammer seemed to pierce through heaven and earth, but Zheng Xin was only at the late epoch level. The attacker was a true epoch peak master.

But Zheng Xin had no choice but to act, as Luo Tian's current state couldn't withstand this attack. The others' speed was too slow to react in time.

"Crack..." In an instant, the golden sword beam collided with Zheng Xin's green hammer.

Zheng Xin's body was sent flying backward, and waves of sword energy pierced into his body. His back was caught by Xu Lizi and others.

"Who is it!" Xu Lizi and others shouted angrily at the void, but no fluctuations were found.

"The attacker isn't here!" Then Luo Tian's eyes flashed with purple light, piercing through space to see who had attacked him.

"Ten thousand zhang... a hundred thousand zhang..." Luo Tian's vision followed the sword beam's fluctuations, extending endlessly.

Luo Tian's vision was limited. He could only see up to several ten thousand zhang, but he saw a ghostly figure disappearing in the gray void.

"Who is it?" Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, his mind thinking deeply. But after a while, he had no clue. After all, there were too many people with reasons to attack him.

"Can you guys save me first!" A weak voice echoed. Zheng Xin's face turned as pale as Luo Tian's, blood gushing from his mouth.

Zheng Xin was at the late epoch level. He had blocked an attack from an epoch peak master, and his ability to withstand it showed his extraordinary talent.

But it also caused Zheng Xin unbearable pain. Golden sword energy was constantly slicing through his meridians.

"Extract that sword energy!" Xu Lizi and others used their power to draw out the scattered sword energy from Zheng Xin's body. The pain made Zheng Xin scream.

"Can't you be a little gentler? I'm really afraid of pain, and you know that!"

"Ah... Xu Lizi, you're retaliating against me! I only put some medicine in your water, and I told you that the medicine was given by Gu Lei!"

"Also, Sun Keming, what's with your attitude? I only took something from you. Are you really that upset!" Zheng Xin, despite his heavy injuries, still couldn't stop talking.

"Nobody can shut him up!" Luo Tian looked at Zheng Xin's loud complaints with a helpless expression, shaking his head in frustration.

"Finally revealed!" Xu Lizi said. He slapped Zheng Xin's back, and the last sword energy shot out from his back.

"However, you did well this time. The one who's afraid of death, yet so brave!" Xu Lizi and others smiled, even though they kept teasing Zheng Xin, they still helped him recover.

"Dad, you're my real dad!" Luo Tianyao looked at Zheng Xin with respect, as if looking at a hero.

"Pu..." Upon hearing Luo Tianyao's words, Zheng Xin spat out blood and then raised his hand to slap Luo Tianyao's head.

"Damn it, I'm not your real dad. Who is?" Zheng Xin cursed, looking at Luo Tianyao, wondering how he had such a foolish son.

"Haha..." The group laughed at the conversation between the father and son.

"Uncle Zheng, Tianyao is straightforward!" Luo Xiting smiled and spoke to Zheng Xin.

"Hey, niece, you haven't even married yet and are already defending your husband. I'm your husband's father, your uncle!" Zheng Xin spoke without restraint to Luo Xiting.

"Uncle Zheng, you once reported me to Qingqing Auntie, saying that Xu Uncle was flirting with other women. That's why Xu Uncle was made to kneel for three days and nights! I've never told Xu Uncle about it!" Luo Xiting's eyes sparkled with mischief as she spoke to Zheng Xin.

"Zheng... Xin... you bastard!" Xu Lizi's face turned dark upon hearing Luo Xiting's words, glaring at Zheng Xin with teeth clenched.

"Old Xu, calm down. I was just joking around with Qingqing Auntie!" Zheng Xin hadn't finished speaking when he felt a chill in his heart.

"You're going to pay for this!" Xu Lizi clenched his teeth, but knowing Zheng Xin's current condition, he could only keep this grudge in mind.

"Still not learning his lesson. He's been humiliated so many times by Luo Xiting, but he still can't control his mouth!" Gu Lei also looked with disdain, clearly upset about Zheng Xin exposing him before.

"Luotian! Mengru!" As the group was laughing, they finally reached the outskirts of the Tianyuan Continent. A series of voices echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

Chapter 1538: Rest and Recovery

The group immediately surrounded Luo Tian and others, their faces filled with joy. Especially when they saw Sun Meng by Luo Tian's side, their faces were full of excitement.

"Luotian!" Jiang Sici and Leng Qiuchan approached Luo Tian, hugging him.

Years of friendship had made the four women close like sisters. Now that Sun Meng had returned, they were naturally overjoyed.

"Luotian, your injuries?" Soon after, everyone felt Luo Tian and Sun Meng's weakness, their eyes filled with concern.

"It's fine. But I need some rest!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, though he had suffered heavy injuries, he still spoke to them to avoid their worry.

"Alright, don't disturb Luotian's rest. Let him recover first!" Luo Xiong spoke, worried about his grandson and led everyone back to the Tianyuan Continent.

Under the group's escort, Luo Tian and Sun Meng returned to their residence. Once they reached their home, both of them felt completely drained and collapsed onto the big bed.

Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sici, with expressions of concern, sat by their sides to guard them. Although the Tianyuan Continent was full of strong people now, they were still worried.

After a brief rest, Luo Tian and Sun Meng sat cross-legged. Luo Xiong and Xuan Bing Old Ancestor brought the Purple Dawn Divine Lotus to Luo Tian.

Jiang Nanxuan also came, wanting to give Luo Tian and Sun Meng the petals of the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower. However, Luo Tian refused.

They had suffered heavy injuries, but a single Purple Dawn Divine Lotus was enough. Plus, there was Xiao Qian, the living immortal herb, which had powerful effects on Luo Tian's spiritual recovery.

The Purple Dawn Divine Lotus radiated strong vitality, landing between Luo Tian and Sun Meng. Xiao Qian also obediently sat in front of them, emitting invisible waves that flowed into their bodies.

Using two immortal herbs for healing—this was only possible for Luo Tian, even epoch masters hadn't done such a lavish act.

As they began to heal, the room fell silent. Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sici also sat by Luo Tian and Sun Meng's sides.

Luo Tian and Sun Meng's injuries were recovering at a terrifying speed, showcasing the miraculous nature of immortal herbs.

Time passed slowly. Although they had immortal herbs, Sun Meng still took nearly a month to fully recover. Luo Tian's injuries were worse, especially after self-sundering his spirit. The Purple Dawn Divine Lotus couldn't help him recover. Fortunately, Xiao Qian, who had transformed into a human form, was effective in spiritual recovery, allowing Luo Tian to recover.

After another month, Luo Tian's spirit recovered with Xiao Qian's help. He slowly opened his eyes.

At the moment he opened his eyes, a look of pain flashed in Luo Tian's eyes. Although his spirit had recovered, the gray curse power still remained and couldn't be erased.

"Luotian?" The three women guarding him clearly saw the pain in Luo Tian's eyes. Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sici also learned from Sun Meng about the curse power's发作, their eyes filled with worry.

"It's fine. My injuries have recovered. This curse power can't harm me!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, looking at Xiao Qian who had visibly weakened. He felt grateful and then waved his hands, using the "Wanwu Huasheng" technique to send it onto Xiao Qian.

Xiao Qian's face showed enjoyment. Under Luo Tian's full power, his body emitted a series of cracks, and his small body gradually grew.

"Take this little one to Jiang Nanxuan!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gently patting Xiao Qian's head.

Jiang Nanxuan had merged with the immortal herb Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower. Now, Jiang Nanxuan was an immortal herb himself. Xiao Qian was also an immortal herb. If he could cultivate, he would surely become a powerful figure in the future.

"Okay," Sun Meng nodded. Although Xiao Qian had some self-preservation abilities, his terrifying speed made it impossible for anyone to catch him. But becoming stronger was still good.

"However, Fuxingxuan has had some problems these days!" Sun Meng spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian with a worried expression.

"What?" Upon hearing Sun Meng's words, Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed. He tightly clenched his fists, unsure of his feelings toward Fuxingxuan—whether it was guilt or affection.

"Buzz..." Sun Meng waved her hand, and the Qiankun Zhenshen Pagoda appeared before them. Waves of gray mist surged out, and a gray spirit floated from the Qiankun Zhenshen Pagoda. Though it had transformed into a spirit, its beauty was still breathtaking.

"Luotian!" As Fuxingxuan's spirit appeared, it floated toward Luo Tian, eyes filled with longing.

"What's going on? Your spirit has already recovered!" Upon seeing Fuxingxuan's strange behavior, Luo Tian immediately noticed something was wrong.

At that time, Fuxingxuan's spirit had nearly collapsed. Luo Tian had self-sundered half of his spirit to save her, and with Xiao Qian's effective immortal herbs for spirits, Fuxingxuan had seemed to recover. If she could craft a body, she would be revived. Though her strength might decrease slightly, she would still come back to life.

But now Fuxingxuan's spirit was still there, but clearly much weaker than when she had first recovered.

"I've used a forbidden technique—Moon Goddess's Wrath. According to the rules, I should be dead now. But I'm still alive until I see you one last time. I'm satisfied!" Fuxingxuan smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

"Why are you so foolish!" Luo Tian's face wore a bitter smile as he touched Fuxingxuan's gray face.

"You won't die. If you do, your two brothers will definitely skin me alive!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of smile. He sent more seals onto Fuxingxuan's spirit.

"Cut..." Luo Tian cut off part of his spirit again, integrating it into Fuxingxuan's spirit. This made her recover fully. Though she was in a bad state, she was much better than before.

"Yes, sister Fuxingxuan, you should live on!" Sun Meng smiled and spoke to Fuxingxuan. She remembered the moment when Fuxingxuan had blocked a fatal strike for Luo Tian, and even she felt moved.

"Let's think about how to help Fuxingxuan recover!" Sun Meng and Jiang Sici spoke softly, obviously grateful for Fuxingxuan.

"Go see Grand Elder. Perhaps the Grand Elder has a solution!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, changing his plan. He still had Xiao Qian take Fuxingxuan back to the Qiankun Zhenshen Pagoda. At this moment, Xiao Qian's role was crucial.

Although Luo Tian was a spirit guardian, he could only keep Fuxingxuan's spirit from collapsing. However, if they tried to craft a body for her now, she would still be infected by the forbidden technique. That would be even more complicated.

At this moment, Luo Tian could only rely on his support—Grand Elder Gu Tianshu, Dongbo Xin, and Ji Jiu You. They had a certain relationship with him. If they still couldn't find a solution, unless he broke through to become an epoch master, Fuxingxuan would never fully recover.

Sun Meng, Jiang Sici, and Leng Qiuchan naturally wouldn't object to Luo Tian's actions. As for what Luo Tian would do after Fuxingxuan recovered, they could only take it one step at a time.

Luo Tian led the three women out of the room. It was noon, and as soon as they stepped outside, warm sunlight shone on their faces. Luo Tian's complexion improved slightly.

"Luotian!" As soon as Luo Tian appeared, a series of figures emerged before him. They couldn't let go of Luo Tian after his heavy injuries, even though no one was visible, they were secretly protecting him.

"Everyone, thank you!" Luo Tian smiled gently at the familiar figures before him, his eyes filled with admiration.

After twenty years, the Tianyuan Continent had changed a lot. Whether it was the older generation of strong people or the younger generation, the Tianyuan Continent had developed rapidly. Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian had entered the epoch peak.

The younger generation was also full of strong people, all entering the late epoch level. Jiang Nanxuan and Guan Xingjian had entered the epoch peak, becoming great masters. Now, the Tianyuan Continent had become a place like the great sanctuaries. No matter which sanctuary, none could surpass the Tianyuan Continent. Even the divine clan couldn't match the current Tianyuan Continent.

The youngest generation, Luo Li and his peers, were also dazzling. Luo Xiting, Luo Li, Zi Mo, Dong Yichen, and others had made other regions' young prodigies gasp for breath.

Flourishing. Now, the Tianyuan Continent was truly described by these four words. Especially since the Tianyuan Continent had Grand Elder Gu Tianshu, and Dongbo Xin and Ji Jiu You were closely related to it. During the twenty years Luo Tian was away, Ji Jiu You had visited the Tianyuan Continent and taken Luo Li as his disciple.

Soon, people gathered in a large hall. Their faces were filled with joy as they conversed with Luo Tian.

Luo Tian also recounted his experiences over the years. The people were deeply moved, and then they all discussed.

"What about the Great Ancient Clan? If they dare to come, we'll fight them!" Zheng Xin had recovered his lively spirit and kept cursing.

Luo Tian looked at the people with fierce energy. Though he was happy, his heart felt a deep worry, especially thinking about the person who had attacked him when he returned. This worry became even stronger.

Chapter 1539: Second Life?

At first glance, the Tianyuan Continent was strong. But the more so it was, the more careful one had to be. After all, with the current energy of the Tianyuan Continent, without considering Gu Tianshu's relationship, it could withstand three or four great sanctuaries. Such strength made other regions' sanctuaries uncomfortable.

Especially since someone had attacked him when he returned, which indicated a big problem. Now that the Tianyuan Continent was so strong, if Luo Tian and Sun Meng, who could kill ancient kings' heirs, returned, it would be like adding wings to a tiger. The Tianyuan Continent would become even more unbeatable.

"Be prepared for danger!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, looking at the noisy crowd. He sighed deeply.

With internal envy from various sanctuaries and external hatred from the ancient tribes, Luo Tian couldn't help but think about the future of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Enlightenment!" Luo Tian whispered to himself. The only solution was enlightenment. If he became an epoch master and subdued the world, all problems would be solved.

"Luotian!" Zhang Ziping smiled and led Lei Yong and Ji Chen into the hall.

"Senior Brother!" Luo Tian bowed to his three senior brothers, sensing an unusual aura on their bodies.

As the three entered the hall, the noisy hall quieted down. People looked at Zhang Ziping and his companions, knowing that if there was no major issue, Zhang Ziping wouldn't have come out of the Dao Mountain.

"Back?" Zhang Ziping smiled and looked at Luo Tian, then his eyes showed admiration. As Luo Tian's senior brother, Zhang Ziping had watched Luo Tian rise.

"Yes, I'm back!" Luo Tian smiled respectfully. He felt that Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen had a certain fear in their aura despite being at the late epoch level.

"If you have time, come visit us. Let's catch up! Also, since the last time you left, the Master has also had some changes!" Zhang Ziping spoke to Luo Tian.

"What!" Upon hearing Zhang Ziping's words, Luo Tian was shocked. Since he had sealed the faint spirit in Zhang Daotian's statues years ago, he had been wandering and hadn't had time to pay attention.

Now that Zhang Ziping and his companions had personally come to the Five Elements Mountain to tell him this, Luo Tian knew something big must have happened.

"What's going on?" The original residents of the Tianyuan Continent were also excited, looking at Zhang Ziping and his companions, waiting for their next words.

"It's better to go see it yourself. We don't understand spirits well, so we can't explain it clearly!" Zhang Ziping spoke softly, his voice filled with joy. The change wasn't something bad.

"Okay!" Luo Tian didn't dare to delay and followed Zhang Ziping and his companions toward the Dao Mountain.

Others had no interest in staying there anymore. They all left the hall, turning into long rainbows and landing by the four statues on the Dao Mountain.

"This!" As soon as they landed, Luo Tian's eyes focused on the four stone statues and then flashed with waves of light.
