Boom... Blood mist surged as Jiang Yufeng was shattered by Luo Tian's fist, vanishing before him.

"Second Master!"

"You actually killed Second Master!" Jiang Cheng, engaged in battle with Jiang Yuzhe and Sima Feiying, trembled as he gazed at Luo Tian standing there.

"Luo Tian..." Jiang Huantian, Jiang Yuzhe, and Sima Feiying all stared at Luo Tian in bewilderment. None had expected Luo Tian to have slain Jiang Yufeng. Those who entered the Immortal Ruins were all individuals with immense backgrounds; few would resort to such ruthless measures unless they bore an unrelenting grudge. To kill the son of the Supreme Heaven Immortal King was akin to slaying him under his very nose—no one dared such audacity.

"You've made a grave mistake, boy. You killed Second Master; from now on, there'll be no place for you in the Immortal Realm!" Jiang Cheng bellowed, his voice laced with fury. His eyes burned crimson; Luo Tian's act had made them all complicit, and their survival was uncertain.

"You deserve death!" In an instant, the three abandoned Jiang Huantian and lunged at Luo Tian.

"Stop them!" Jiang Yuzhe's gaze flickered with calculation before he addressed the stunned Jiang Huantian.

"Yes..." Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying responded hurriedly, but it was too late. Jiang Cheng's attack had already reached Luo Tian. The half-Immortal King unleashed his full power, spitting out a river of gray mist that transformed into a dragon, radiating apocalyptic energy as it surged toward Luo Tian.

The other two youths also unleashed their full strength, striking with martial techniques toward Luo Tian. A half-Immortal King and two peak Immortal disciples—such a combined attack could be called an annihilation. No one beneath the Immortal King could withstand it.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, a sneer on his lips. He gripped Longyuan Sword in one hand while the other reached out, summoning a figure that gradually coalesced beside him—Jiang Yufeng's pale face, his cultivation level now at peak Immortal.

"What's going on?" Jiang Yufeng blinked in confusion, fear flickering in his gaze. He felt as if he had truly died before, but then sensed himself reviving.

"Did this place really not allow death? My cultivation dropped to peak Immortal!" Jiang Yufeng's face lit with joy.

"Master!" As Jiang Yufeng was still dazed, Jiang Cheng's attack struck. The three men stared in disbelief—Jiang Yufeng had suddenly revived.

"You...!" Jiang Yufeng's joy faded as he felt himself restrained. Hearing Jiang Cheng's cry, he was momentarily startled. His gaze fell upon Luo Tian's smiling face and the approaching gray dragon.

This was Jiang Yufeng's last sight—moments later, the dragon struck his body, sending him flying backward.

Luo Tian held Jiang Yufeng before him, blocking the dragon's impact. The dragon began eroding Jiang Yufeng's body, and a scream echoed through the starry void. Meanwhile, Luo Tian punched outward, colliding with a golden vortex, and took a palm strike to his back.

"Damn..." Jiang Cheng's face darkened as he watched Jiang Yufeng being eroded by the dragon. They hadn't expected him to revive, and now it was too late.

The thunderous roar filled the void as chaotic energy engulfed Luo Tian. Jiang Cheng's group turned pale.

"Did we really kill Second Master..." Jiang Cheng trembled, gazing at the chaotic currents, hoping to see Jiang Yufeng revive again.

"This is your own doing, you sissy. Don't blame me!" Luo Tian's figure emerged in people's sight, his voice laced with mockery as he looked at Jiang Cheng.

"You're the one who caused this. We've already committed a death sentence; why not kill you for company?" Jiang Cheng roared, gazing at Luo Tian's disheveled form. The relentless events had driven them to the brink of madness.

"Boom..." As the three men raged, another surge rippled through the air. A phantom figure gradually solidified into reality—Jiang Yufeng reappeared before them.

"How is this possible?" Except for Luo Tian, the others wore expressions of disbelief. Jiang Yufeng's resurrection was initially unremarkable—after all, he was the son of the Supreme Heaven Immortal King. But now, his revival exceeded their comprehension; they could not fathom what secret technique he had used.

"Boom..." Before anyone reacted, Luo Tian grabbed Jiang Yufeng and lifted him.

Chapter 2265: Star Domain Lord

Jiang Yufeng, now at peak Immortal cultivation, trembled in fear as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"What technique is this?" Jiang Cheng's group also wore expressions of shock, staring at the revived Jiang Yufeng in Luo Tian's grasp.

"Did Luo Tian do this? Killing then reviving..." Jiang Yuzhe and the others were stunned, witnessing an unprecedented event.

"Let go of me..." Jiang Yufeng's spirit quivered as he addressed Luo Tian. In such a short time, he had died twice and inexplicably revived—now weak, he was but an ant before Luo Tian.

"Boom..." But Jiang Yufeng's plea was met with a crushing grip. He was shattered again, turning into blood mist.

"Luo Tian!" Jiang Cheng and the two peak Immortal youths cried out, watching Jiang Yufeng turn into mist again.

"Is this too much?" Jiang Huantian and the others thought, sensing Jiang Yufeng would surely bear psychological scars.

Jiang Cheng's group could only watch helplessly, afraid to act recklessly for fear Luo Tian might accidentally kill Jiang Yufeng. They watched in terror.

"Indeed, he's revived!" After a moment, the group sighed in relief as Jiang Yufeng coalesced beside Luo Tian once more.

"Exciting, isn't it?" Luo Tian smiled as he held Jiang Yufeng at early peak Immortal level. He hadn't expected this smooth success—these people had not stopped him from killing Jiang Yufeng.

"Excuse me, I'm sorry. Please let me go!" Jiang Yufeng roared, but before he could finish his curse, Luo Tian crushed him again.

"Luo Tian, you'll never have peace!"

"Boom..."

"Luo Tian, I'll dismember you!"

"Boom..." Luo Tian no longer hesitated, repeatedly crushing Jiang Yufeng. Each time, Jiang Yufeng's cultivation plummeted—half-Immortal, then peak Heaven Immortal.

Jiang Cheng's group watched Jiang Yufeng die again and again, their spirits trembling as they gazed at Luo Tian like a demon.

"He's a devil!" Jiang Cheng's group thought, staring at Luo Tian as if he were a pervert. In less than half an hour, Luo Tian had killed Jiang Yufeng five or six times; each revival took longer.

"Does he have a fetish?" Jiang Yuzhe also watched Luo Tian, as did Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying. They had never seen such a situation before.

"Uncle, I'm sorry! I truly regret it. Please let me go!" When Jiang Yufeng's cultivation dropped to early Heaven Immortal, he finally surrendered, begging for mercy.

Jiang Yufeng was terrified—having died so many times, each time seeming truly dead. His mind had completely broken; it was too torturous.

"Can I use the Mind-Seed Demon technique?" Luo Tian mused. He had planned to kill Jiang Yufeng, but now it was impossible—killing him would surely bring the wrath of the Supreme Heaven Immortal King.

He extended his hand, and a string of demonic patterns flew from his fingers. Jiang Yufeng was too fragile now. But as the demon patterns emerged, the entire starry void trembled. The patterns exploded into black mist, vanishing before Luo Tian.

"What?" Luo Tian shivered. He had clearly felt an aura of fury, as if the heavens pressed down upon him. A cold, suffocating killing intent wrapped around him—though it seemed instantaneous, he felt as if he had endured millennia.

"It's the Supreme Heaven Immortal King!" Luo Tian instantly understood, his spirit trembling. He gazed at the starry void, sensing eyes watching him—only a true master could feel such an aura.

Instinctively, Luo Tian flung Jiang Yufeng away, his heart racing with fear.

Seeing Luo Tian throw Jiang Yufeng out, Jiang Cheng's group rushed forward to catch the trembling Jiang Yufeng. They exchanged glances—this situation was no longer one for battle. Jiang Yufeng had dropped to early Heaven Immortal; even their battle's residual energy could kill him.

"That pressure—definitely the Supreme Heaven Immortal King! He's been watching over the Star Domain!" Luo Tian's mind roiled with waves of fear. The thought of having killed Jiang Yufeng so many times under the Supreme Heaven Immortal King's gaze filled him with unease.

"Respected elder, I didn't mean to!" Luo Tian sighed bitterly. Jiang Yuzhe's group looked at him, unaware of why he was so shaken.

"It doesn't make sense. I killed him so many times, yet the Supreme Heaven Immortal King didn't interfere. When I used Mind-Seed Demon, he appeared—evidently, he wasn't afraid of his son's death. But Mind-Seed Demon frightened him, so he warned me. That means as long as Jiang Yufeng isn't dead, everything's fine!" Luo Tian mused, understanding the Supreme Heaven Immortal King's stance.

"Luo Tian, are you alright?" As Luo Tian pondered, Jiang Yuzhe addressed him, snapping him back to reality.

"I'm fine... I'm fine..." Luo Tian wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, gazing at the starry void with lingering fear.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, his heart still shaken by the Supreme Heaven Immortal King's retribution.

"Luo Tian, what technique was that? How could it revive the dead?" Jiang Yuzhe sighed in relief upon hearing Luo Tian was unharmed.

"My technique?"

"Haha, I'll tell you. Anyone could do it—rules of the three thousand small worlds are like this. Once one reaches a certain level, they can regen blood!" Luo Tian realized why Jiang Cheng's group hadn't stopped him. They had feared he truly killed Jiang Yufeng.

"Ah, I see!" Jiang Yuzhe's eyes lit with understanding as he gazed at Luo Tian.

The ascended ones, Jiang Yuzhe's group instantly realized Luo Tian's identity. However, they didn't dwell on it—there were many ascended ones in the Immortal Realm.

Of course, Eternal Life Mountain's habit of seizing ascended ones was known to Supreme Heaven Mountain. But this was Supreme Heaven Mountain; Eternal Life Mountain's reach didn't extend here.

"Little wonder Luo Xiong's cultivation speed is so fast!" Jiang Yuzhe marveled. He had met Luo Tian back then, who was merely a Heaven Immortal.

In such few years, he had reached peak Immortal—Jiang Yuzhe was also at peak Immortal, but his resources were incomparable to Luo Tian's due to his backing from Supreme Heaven Mountain.

"Now, my second brother is at Heaven Immortal—no longer a threat. Only my first and third brothers remain!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke softly, regardless of what techniques Jiang Yufeng had yet to use. His current strength was a hard limit.

"Yes, he'll need at least two months to recover to peak Immortal!" Luo Tian estimated Jiang Yufeng's recovery time.

"Then, should we go find that Star Domain Lord?" Sima Feiying asked. Though they had seemingly defeated Jiang Yufeng's group, it was only Jiang Yufeng who was severely wounded. Jiang Cheng and the two peak Immortal disciples were still intact.

"I've only entered half-Immortal for a short time; I'm no match for those elders!" Jiang Huantian's eyes showed guilt. His talent was good, but it wasn't solid enough.

"Most of the Star Domain's people have gathered at the central Star Continent. They must be heading there too."

"You know, those brothers aren't stupid. If they subjugate the Star Domain Lord, they can control most of the Star Domain's forces!"

"Our strength isn't weak. We just lack half-Immortal. If I win, I'll help Jiang Huantian前辈 to fight them. We can definitely battle them. My only fear is if those young masters unite against us—then it would be difficult!" Luo Tian spoke softly, sharing his thoughts.

"There's a high chance they've never liked me. If not for that, I wouldn't have fought so hard—they can't tolerate me!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke, his voice laced with helplessness.

"Then let's go to the Star Continent first and see the situation!" Luo Tian spoke softly, and he and Jiang Yuzhe's group took flight toward the Star Domain's center. Time passed, and though the Star Domain was vast, their speed was swift. In five days, they reached its center.

As soon as they arrived at the center, they heard thunderous roars. A multitude of figures stood in the starry void, their backdrops consisting of countless continents floating above them. Over a million people—each a Heaven Immortal, with several peak Immortals and one half-Immortal. Opposing them were Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yuwen's groups, their faces grim. They had previously swept through several continents, killing and intimidating to subjugate many Star Domain people.

But later they discovered the void had emptied, realizing everyone had gathered at the Star Domain's center. They had previously swept through several continents, assuming people were weak—even a Heaven Immortal could rule a continent. But they hadn't expected this small world's people to be so powerful, with some reaching half-Immortal.

"Another one came?" A youth radiated great power, his brows furrowed slightly. His eyes were like two blazing suns, gazing at Luo Tian's group.

"Is it Jiang Yuzhe?" Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yuwen's groups furrowed their brows, also spotting Luo Tian's group.

"Second Master was truly useless—he couldn't even subdue these people!" Jiang Yulong sneered, gazing at the approaching Jiang Yuzhe's group with coldness.

"Haha..." As Jiang Yulong's group grew dark, a loud laugh echoed in their ears. The Star Domain Lord smiled, gazing at Luo Tian's group approaching, his eyes flickering with excitement.

Chapter 2266: Uncle-in-law

"Star Domain Lord, submit to us sensibly; otherwise, this Star Domain will be bloodbathed today!" Jiang Yulong bellowed, seeing Jiang Yuzhe arrive. He exchanged a glance with Jiang Yuwen and made a decision instantly.

"Who do you think you are to make us submit?" The Star Domain Lord replied coldly, his aura radiating. He held a green spear, dazzling and obviously not ordinary—resembling a star.

"Uncle-in-law..." Luo Tian and Jiang Yuzhe's group stood at a distance, gazing at the Star Domain Lord confronting Jiang Yulong. Luo Tian couldn't help but speak.

"Uncle-in-law?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Jiang Yuzhe's group's mouths twitched. They didn't know why Luo Tian spoke thus.

"That Star Domain Lord is my uncle-in-law! Damn!" Luo Tian gazed at the youth holding the green spear, clad in starry robes. The spear was once the era treasure of the Star Moon Clan—Star Moon Spear. But now, it radiated greater power than before, clearly at the level of a superior divine artifact. It even surpassed some superior divine artifacts.

The one holding the Star Moon Spear was none other than the former Emperor of the Star Moon Clan, Fu Xingyang—Fu Xuan's elder brother.

"Everyone seems to be doing better than me..." Luo Tian felt a bit speechless, gazing at Fu Xingyang standing there with authority. Though he didn't know how Fu Xingyang reached half-Immortal, Luo Tian felt a bit unbalanced. Looking at Fu Xingyang's appearance, he was clearly thriving here, commanding so many people and having such a powerful faction, ruling the entire Star Domain.

"This is an existing sect!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered. He hoped to establish a sect now. But a sect must have people and strong masters. Currently, Xiang Ming was still in the Dead Sea; after he emerged, Luo Tian planned to have them establish a sect in the Middle Three Realms.

This million people were more than enough to form a sect. Remember, the Dragon Ascension Sect had only tens of thousands left, yet it was still a sect in the Middle Three Realms.

The Star River Prefecture had about a million people total; this Star Domain's million people, if truly merged into their sect, would instantly make it one of the top sects in the Middle Three Realms.

Luo Tian's eyes brightened, gazing at the dense crowd. His gaze fell on Fu Xingyang.

"You're a half-Immortal, but we have two. Do you think your people can be our match?" Jiang Yulong bellowed, his voice laced with impatience. Though Fu Xingyang had nearly ten peak Immortals behind him, in Jiang Yulong's view, they were nothing. Fu Xingyang himself was just a local who hadn't seen the world—unfamiliar with powerful attack methods.

"Then we'll show you what abilities you have to subjugate us!"

"Deploy the Star Array!" Fu Xingyang coldly sneered, ignoring Jiang Yulong's threat. He addressed the people behind him.

"Yes!" A chorus of roars erupted, shaking the heavens. A towering aura surged instantly. Though Jiang Yulong's group was strong, facing over a million people made them feel uneasy and immediately intimidated by the aura.

"Buzz..." A hum resonated as figures radiated starlight, moving like stars. Starlight enveloped Jiang Yuzhe's eight people.

"Uncle-in-law, are you here to subjugate me too?" As Luo Tian pondered, Fu Xingyang's voice echoed in his ears, snapping him back to reality.

"Uncle-in-law, I'm here to help you!" Upon hearing Fu Xingyang's words, Luo Tian quickly spoke. He couldn't afford to offend this person; if Fu Xuan encountered him, he'd be in trouble.

Luo Tian took flight, landing beside Fu Xingyang with Jiang Yuzhe's group. His eyes gleamed with intense joy—should Fu Xuan learn of Fu Xingyang's news, he'd be very pleased.

"Uncle-in-law? Relative?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's address, Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yuwen furrowed their brows. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to know the Star Domain Lord.

"Old Nine, isn't this against the rules?" Jiang Yulong's eyes flickered slightly as he gazed at Jiang Yuzhe, shouting loudly. This was too unfair for them.

"Crush them!" But Fu Xingyang ignored Jiang Yulong's words. At this moment, although they had only one half-Immortal, with the Star Array in place, Fu Xingyang was confident he could kill these eight.

"Buzz..." As Fu Xingyang's words echoed, stars began to spin rapidly.

"Roar..." After ten breaths, starlight converged into a roaring bear, appearing before Luo Tian's group.

"Buzz..." As the bear formed, another scorpion emerged beneath the stars, its body radiating powerful energy. Twelve beasts formed in an instant—each seemingly individual but connected by some mysterious bond, causing Luo Tian's face to show horror. He gazed at the twelve starlight beasts surrounding them, each with a million people's strength.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian was horrified, the twelve beasts launched terrifying attacks. The bear's palm struck, collapsing space and rushing toward Jiang Yulong's group.

"Uncle-in-law, you're good! What have you been through these years!" Luo Tian gazed at Fu Xingyang, who wore confidence.

"You little bastard, why are you only this level? You're too slow!" Fu Xingyang gazed at the twelve beasts attacking Jiang Yulong's group, then spoke to Luo Tian, making him roll his eyes.

The twelve beasts were strong but struggled against a half-Immortal. However, they easily crushed peak Immortals.

"Wait for me to kill them, then we'll chat!" Fu Xingyang sneered, his Star Moon Spear radiating ten thousand feet of brilliance. He rushed toward Jiang Yulong's group confronting the twelve beasts.

"Uncle-in-law, you can lower your level, but don't kill them!" Luo Tian transmitted mentally.

"Hey, Luo Tian, should we help?" Jiang Yuzhe was stunned, surprised by the smooth success. After regaining his senses, he asked Luo Tian.

"Of course we should help! Helping proves we're on their side, making the people of this star domain feel better!" Luo Tian replied, his Longyuan Sword glowing as he took flight toward Jiang Yulong.

"Good!" Jiang Yuzhe nodded, his Supreme Heaven Sword glowing as he rushed toward the eight.

Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying also took flight. In an instant, Jiang Yulong's group felt the pressure.

The twelve beasts each possessed the power to annihilate peak Immortals. Jiang Huantian and Fu Xingyang were both half-Immortals; Luo Tian, Jiang Yuzhe, and Sima Feiying were no pushovers. The situation quickly turned one-sided.

"Crack..." Jiang Yulong's gray staff swung powerfully, but he was outmatched. A starlight beast's horn collided with Jiang Yulong's staff, sending him retreating. Before he could steady himself, Luo Tian struck with thunderous might, slashing down with Longyuan Sword.

"Damn!" Jiang Yulong's face darkened. He raised his gray staff overhead, meeting the descending sword.

"Crack..." Thunderous sound echoed. Jiang Yulong's staff trembled violently, emitting a series of hums. His body transformed into a streak of light, falling downward and crashing through a continent before stopping.

"Mo..." Meanwhile, the starlight beast marched across space toward Jiang Yulong, giving him no time to catch his breath.

"Master, we're not their match. We can't fight! Let's retreat!" A senior whispered to Jiang Yulong, his voice laced with urgency. He was being attacked by Jiang Huantian and two beasts, but Jiang Huantian and the starlight beasts weren't easy either. They were evenly matched.

"I can't retreat!" Jiang Yulong roared internally, again being rammed by the beast. Blood spewed from his mouth as Luo Tian's attack struck again, leaving no time for Jiang Yulong to think of anything else.

"Master, have you forgotten the life-saving item the Grand Elder gave you? Use it once, and we can escape!" The senior punched back Jiang Huantian, whispering to Jiang Yulong.

"Good. I'll remember this debt and plan later. I don't believe it!" Jiang Yulong's face darkened.

"However, before leaving, I'll make this kid die!" Jiang Yulong's eyes flashed coldness as he gazed at the approaching Jiang Yulong.

"Boom..." Luo Tian punched, breaking space and rushing toward Jiang Yulong.

"Huh?" But as Luo Tian's fist was just thrown, a sense of danger surged into his heart. He startled slightly and saw Jiang Yulong's sinister expression.

"Die!" Jiang Yulong calmly raised his gray staff, its surface swirling with gray patterns. A towering aura radiated from the staff.

"Buzz..." The thick staff suddenly expanded, pressing down on everything. It radiated an overwhelming fluctuation, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"How is this possible? This attack rivals a Immortal King's initial level!" Luo Tian's face changed instantly, gazing at the staff's overwhelming power. He was certain this wasn't Jiang Yulong's ability.

But Luo Tian had no time to escape. He gritted his teeth, punching forward with all his strength, pouring his Immortal power into the fist.

Chapter 2267: Life-Saving Technique

The thick staff descended, its overwhelming aura causing Luo Tian's face to change. This overwhelming power was beyond his ability to withstand, equivalent to a Immortal King's attack. But Luo Tian had no choice but to grit his teeth, punching forward with all his might.

"Strong punch, but still not enough!" Jiang Yulong sneered, his long hair flying as he raised the staff and brought it down.

"Buzz..." As the staff was about to collide with Luo Tian's fist, black mist surged from Luo Tian's body. With a thunderous roar, a black hand materialized and struck out.

"This..." Luo Tian was stunned, gazing at the black hand emerging from his body. He was bewildered.

Soul-Devouring Ghost Mist, wildly gathering—this black hand radiated coldness and collided with the staff.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed, shaking space. The twelve starlight beasts nearly scattered. Everyone's faces showed shock as they gazed at the explosion of the black hand and staff.

The overwhelming power swept over Luo Tian and Jiang Yulong, sending them flying. Both spat blood.

"It's the technique of the Demon King!" Luo Tian instantly recalled whose hand it was. He remembered when he left the Reincarnation Hell, Du Jianxing of the Poison Sword Immortal had given him life-saving techniques from eight immortal kings. He'd nearly forgotten them, but now his danger had triggered the technique to defend against that Immortal King's attack.

Luo Tian steadied himself, gazing at the destroyed starry void. He forcibly suppressed his shaking blood and wiped his lips, a cold smile on his face as he flew into the still-undying energy.

"Damn, he also has a life-saving technique from an Immortal King!" Jiang Yulong spat blood, his mind in turmoil.

As Jiang Yulong was shocked, Luo Tian's figure attacked again. Still a punch, but it made Jiang Yulong's face change.

"Master! Be careful!" The half-Immortal accompanying Jiang Yulong cried out, trying to rescue but was held back by Fu Xingyang, unable to move.

"Boom..." Blood mist surged. Jiang Yulong's body was shattered by Luo Tian's punch, and his arm also broke—Luo Tian's fist had such immense power.

Luo Tian's face paled, breathing heavily as he watched his arm regrow, a cold smile on his face. He gazed at the blood mist coalescing.

"Luo Tian!" Jiang Yulong cried out, his voice laced with fear. He had killed many in the Star Domain before and knew death could be revived, but dying was no fun.

Jiang Yulong was terrified. He wanted to flee, raising his hand and revealing a golden seal. Without hesitation, he pressed it onto his body.

"Buzz..." The teleportation power surged, making Jiang Yulong's body blur.

"Teleportation Seal?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, moving swiftly toward Jiang Yulong.

"Luo Tian, one day I'll take your life!" Jiang Yulong shouted as he saw Luo Tian approaching.

"You dare to kill my brother-in-law!" As Jiang Yulong shouted, a roar echoed. A wave of pressure swept over, stars shimmering as he appeared beside Jiang Yulong.

Golden light flared. A golden spear shattered space, striking Jiang Yulong's body and turning him into blood mist.

But Jiang Yulong was still turned into mist. The teleportation seal's power remained, absorbing the blood mist and vanishing from the spot.

The golden spear resembled Fu Xingyang's appearance. He wore starry robes, his face carrying amusement as he gazed at Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yuwen's two half-Immortals.

"Another half-Immortal!" Jiang Yuwen's face darkened, gazing at the youth.

"Big brother, did I come too late?" The youth shouted to Fu Xingyang. His gaze fell on Luo Tian: "Brother-in-law, your strength isn't that great either! Haha!"

"You're also a half-Immortal. What did you eat these years?" Luo Tian felt speechless, gazing at the youth approaching him—Fu Xueyue, Fu Xuanyuan's second brother. But his eyes showed excitement.

"Boom..." The two embraced heavily, their faces showing joy. Compared to Fu Xingyang, Luo Tian's relationship with Fu Xueyue was better.

"Talk later. I'll finish them first, hahaha!" Fu Xueyue laughed, looking at Luo Tian with pride. His golden spear radiated divine light as he rushed toward the half-Immortal elder fighting Jiang Huantian.

"Run!" As Fu Xueyue appeared, Jiang Yuwen's group realized they had to flee. They were no match for three half-Immortals.

In an instant, the two half-Immortal elders fought Jiang Huantian and Fu Xingyang. They moved swiftly, tearing through space and fleeing into the void.

The remaining peak Immortals also launched attacks, fleeing toward distant places.

"Jiang Yulong, where are you running?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly. He transmitted to Fu Xueyue and Fu Xingyang, then rushed toward Jiang Yuwen. Others could flee, but Jiang Yuwen couldn't.

Fu Xueyue and Fu Xingyang wore amused expressions, not chasing others but using their hands to imprison space, trapping Jiang Yuwen.

"Teleportation Seal!" Jiang Yuwen's face darkened. Seeing Luo Tian, Fu Xueyue, and Fu Xingyang approaching him, he quickly took out a teleportation seal and pressed it onto himself.

"You think we'll let this mistake happen twice?" Fu Xueyue and Fu Xingyang crossed their arms, surrounding Jiang Yuwen.

"Roar..." The twelve starlight beasts roared, encircling him tightly.

"Damn it, let me teleport!" Jiang Yuwen's face darkened. He continuously activated the seal but found no fluctuation. Seeing Fu Xueyue and Fu Xingyang, along with the twelve beasts, Luo Tian smiled and took a step toward Jiang Yuwen.

"Do you remember when we were in Huantian City? I vowed then to repay the humiliation. This has taken years, but the outcome satisfies me!" Luo Tian smiled softly as he approached Jiang Yuwen.

Jiang Yuzhe, Jiang Huantian, and Sima Feiying stood beside Luo Tian. Jiang Huantian knew what Luo Tian felt; if not for his strong intervention, Luo Tian might have been killed by Jiang Wu Xin. At that time, Jiang Huantian had to admit his decision was correct; otherwise, it would have been very difficult for them in the Star Domain.

Jiang Yuwen's face paled as he gazed at Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang. This encirclement left even a peak Immortal no chance to escape, let alone a half-Immortal.

"Luo Tian, what do you want?" Jiang Yuwen's body trembled like a girl cornered by ten men.

"Don't think about using any Immortal King's life-saving techniques. I can block this once, and I'll do it again!" Luo Tian sneered, his aura radiating that of an Immortal King.

"You..." Jiang Yuwen had no more spirit, standing there with a look of resignation.

"Brother-in-law, what are you waiting for? Just kill him!" Fu Xueyue laughed loudly, swinging his golden spear and striking Jiang Yuwen's body.

"Boom..." Jiang Yuwen's body couldn't withstand it, and Fu Xueyue's spear shattered him.

"Come here!" Fu Xueyue extended his hand. Though he was once a regional prodigy, he couldn't match Luo Tian's变态 (abnormality), but he could still gather Jiang Yuwen's soul after killing him.

A gray soul emerged from the blood mist, solidifying into a body with eyes full of fear.

"You... what do you want?" Jiang Yuwen was terrified, gazing around. His blood gradually lost vitality and divine essence. If it lasted longer, his vitality and divine essence would vanish completely, leaving him to survive only as a soul.
