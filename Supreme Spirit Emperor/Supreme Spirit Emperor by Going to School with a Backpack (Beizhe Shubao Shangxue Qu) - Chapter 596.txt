“Relax!” Luo Tian spoke, his eyes flashing a cold glint. His hands moved swiftly, and eight soul blades erupted from above his head, slicing toward the eight chains. The collision echoed within the vast mind sea, and Luo Tian's face paled as the gray chains trembled violently. Thick gray mist rose from the chains, swirling outward.

“Luo Tian, flee—this place is dangerous!” As the chains trembled, Xiang Tianming's soul regained a sliver of clarity and bellowed at Luo Tian.

“Rustling…!” Just as Xiang Tianming's words faded, the mind sea roiled. Waves of gray mist surged upward from the gray ocean, forming chains that shot toward Luo Tian. Dozens of them.

“Begone…” Luo Tian finally discerned the issue—his mind sea had been infiltrated by something.

“Infiltration? I'll see if you're stronger than the Yellow Spring Water and Ferry Flower!” Luo Tian's face remained cold. He unsheathed Longyuan, his aura of destruction overwhelming. He clashed with the dozen gray chains, then activated the Yellow Spring Step and vanished from sight.

At the same time, Luo Tian held a gourd—the one once belonging to Jiuxian. Without hesitation, he poured its contents downward. Yellow spring water gushed forth.

Rustling…

The yellow spring water dripped into the gray mind sea, instantly spreading outward. A purifying force erupted, expelling waves of gray mist.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and a white flower sprang from his palm—Ferry Flower. The pristine blossom floated gently onto the Yellow Spring Water.

Miraculous phenomena arose: the swirling gray mist coalesced, drawn toward the Ferry Flower. As it merged with the Yellow Spring Water, the gray mind sea gradually shifted in hue.

“Roar…” A guttural cry echoed. The chains binding Xiang Tianming began to fracture, the gray mist churning and forming a phantom figure. Yet it could not resist the Ferry Flower's suction, drawing itself toward the blossom. Xiang Tianming's eyes widened in disbelief—Luo Tian had vanquished what had tormented him so cruelly. Moreover, the flower continued purifying whatever had infiltrated him. He hadn't even known what it looked like, yet Luo Tian had outmaneuvered him.

“Boy, save me! That flower also benefits me!” Xiang Tianming's gray form trembled violently as he addressed Luo Tian, who stood beside the Ferry Flower.

Chapter 2258: Ascending Nine Miles ( )

“Seal the soul!” Luo Tian spoke, pointing his finger. Gray seals danced over Xiang Tianming's body, stabilizing his trembling soul.

“Roar…” On the other side, Xiang Tianming's mind sea was cleansed. A gray figure emerged beneath the Ferry Flower.

“How did you end up here?” Xiang Tianming asked, gazing at Luo Tian. He sensed Luo Tian's aura and furrowed his brow.

“I fell here via a transmission array. How did you end up here, and why are you mindless?” Luo Tian replied. He grabbed the Ferry Flower, revealing a solid soul beneath it.

They exchanged rapid words, recounting their stories. Xiang Tianming's gray face lit with understanding.

“Ah, I've reached the Immortal King realm!” Xiang Tianming murmured. He hadn't encountered any humans since falling here, though he'd met several powerful aquatic beasts. But as his strength reached Immortal King, his mind had been lost. He didn't know what had become of those beasts.

“You're no good, I've reached Immortal King while you were still a Chronos Lord. Why's your cultivation so slow?” Xiang Tianming chuckled, then eyed the Ferry Flower with apprehension.

The gray soul writhed violently but could not escape the Ferry Flower, as if nourishing it.

“What is this soul?” Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. The soul was remarkably pure—even if he devoured it, it would enhance his own soul. Moreover, as the gray soul solidified, its form bore an 80% resemblance to Xiang Tianming. It must be connected to him.

“Respected elder, first devour this soul and restore your own!” Luo Tian urged Xiang Tianming.

Xiang Tianming wasted no time. Facing the torment that had plagued him for years, he devoured the soul. In an instant, his body trembled, and his mind filled with new knowledge.

“Ah! That soul was a fragment—also a Kunpeng. But it was a broken soul, nurtured in the Dead Sea until it gained sentience. Later, I came here and it fixated on me!” Xiang Tianming spoke. Devouring the fragment had fortified his soul.

“Respected elder, could you withdraw your technique? My companions are still outside—they almost got devoured!” Luo Tian implored.

“Fine, you can leave too!” Xiang Tianming chuckled. As his chains fell away, he fully regained control of his body.

Luo Tian nodded and soared from Xiang Tianming's mind sea. Upon exiting, he was yanked by a massive force.

“Stop! Stop…!”

“Finally stopped. If it hadn’t, we’d have been sucked in!” Jiang Huantian and the others sighed deeply. They were now just a few hundred zhang away from the Kunpeng.

“Hum…” The gray eyes gradually cleared. Xiang Tianming's massive eyes saw Jiang Huantian and the others.

“Rustling…” The gray sea surged, erupting from Xiang Tianming's colossal form like a mighty fountain. Luo Tian emerged with it.

“Flee!” Jiang Huantian bellowed, sensing pressure from Xiang Tianming's massive form and instinctively wanting to escape.

“Jiang Huantian, no need to run—these are all allies!” As Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying prepared to flee, Luo Tian's voice echoed in their ears, causing them to pause.

“Luo Tian!” Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying instinctively called Luo Tian's name, gazing at the figure descending from the fountain.

“Hum…” Xiang Tianming's colossal form slowly stirred but did not attack Jiang Huantian and the others.

“Success?” Jiang Huantian's face bore disbelief. They'd thought Luo Tian had no chance of escaping the Kunpeng's belly.

“Yes, success. This is my elder, Xiang Tianming!” Luo Tian introduced, gesturing to the colossal Xiang Tianming. Before him, they were like ants.

“Respected elder!” Jiang Huantian and the others hurriedly bowed. He was an Immortal King, a divine beast—his combat power must be formidable.

“Luo Tian, I'll stay in the Dead Sea for a while. Once I fully grasp this soul's memories and stabilize my strength, I'll come find you!” Xiang Tianming addressed Luo Tian.

“Then respected elder, please escort us out. I heard the Dead Sea's center has a spring. Breaking through it would let us escape!” Luo Tian nodded, his heart racing.

They had finally gained an Immortal King. Once Xiang Tianming left the Dead Sea and returned to the Middle Heavens, they could establish a sect with an Immortal King's protection—far safer.

“Good! Climb onto my back, and I'll take you there!” Xiang Tianming ordered. His colossal form slowly lifted.

“Let's go!” Luo Tian chuckled, leaping upward and landing on Xiang Tianming's massive back.

“Respected elder, my apologies!” Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying bowed respectfully. They dared not be as bold as Luo Tian. The two leapt upward, while the Yousheng Eight Guards said nothing, settling on Xiang Tianming's back to recover their injuries. With an Immortal King guarding them, they had no concerns.

The Kunpeng spread its wings, flying toward the Dead Sea's center. Xiang Tianming had dwelled here for years, his strength growing haphazardly to Immortal King. He knew the Dead Sea well.

His colossal form soared over the sea, and its creatures scattered in fear. Some powerful presences radiated reverence—these made Jiang Huantian shudder.

“These creatures, we once fought over territory and food. The Dead Sea's resources boost cultivation rapidly!” Xiang Tianming explained to Luo Tian.

The Dead Sea had several masters, but with Xiang Tianming now an Immortal King, its balance would change.

“Respected elder, you've found no treasures here over the years?” Luo Tian asked while recovering.

“No, little brat. You're still this way after so long!” Xiang Tianming scolded.

“Treasures are real, but I've lost my mind for so long. Once I have time to scour it, I'll bring them back!” Xiang Tianming replied.

“A Kunpeng rises with the wind, ascending nine miles!” This was a folk saying about the Kunpeng's speed and power. Though it was a legend, there was truth to it.

After four hours of flight, Xiang Tianming finally led Luo Tian and the others to the Dead Sea's center. Others would take years to reach here. Xiang Tianming, as the sea's master, had roamed it thoroughly.

Gray whirlpools formed above the azure sky. Gray water flowed downward, pouring into the Dead Sea—spectacular.

“Escaping here means leaving the Dead Sea. But returning would be very difficult!”

“Boy, you really won't search for treasures here? There must be many good things!” Bontian's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

“Respected elder, this is it. Take us out—until we meet again!” Luo Tian addressed Xiang Tianming, ignoring Bontian's words. He couldn't waste time; he didn't know if the Dead Sea's time flow matched the outside.

“Hmph. Not long—within a year, I'll leave. Then we'll meet again!” Xiang Tianming nodded. He truly didn't want to go. Years ago on the Tianyuan Continent, he'd been cold-hearted, wanting to stay in the Northern Sea and ignore a world-ending war.

But now he had no choice. He was part of the Nine Realms, and his revival relied on Tianyuan. Now that Tianyuan still needed the Nine Realms, no matter the reason, Xiang Tianming would stand.

His colossal form surged toward the descending gray water. A blue barrier enveloped Luo Tian and the others, repelling the rushing waves.

Xiang Tianming's speed was formidable. Though the gray whirlpool seemed near, breaking through it would be ascension.

Gray water crashed downward with immense force. Luo Tian felt pressure in the rushing gray river.

Xiang Tianming was indeed powerful, carrying Luo Tian and the others as if unaffected. His colossal form cleaved through the torrential water, reaching near the whirlpool in under an hour.

“Wait—when I release the barrier, you must push upward for this final stretch!” Xiang Tianming ordered Luo Tian, pausing before the whirlpool.

After obtaining Luo Tian's approval, Xiang Tianming roared, and the barrier vanished. Luo Tian and the others were exposed to the crashing gray water.

“Make way!” Luo Tian growled, Longyuan's blade flashing coldly as he slashed the gray water.

Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying used their techniques, striking the surging water. Xiang Tianming also spat a blue beam.

The collision shook, splitting the water into a vacuum. It appeared before Luo Tian's group.

“Go!” Jiang Huantian and the others leapt upward, rushing toward the gray whirlpool.

Chapter 2259: Anxiety

“Boom…” Eleven figures burst through the gray whirlpool, finally escaping the Dead Sea. As they emerged, waves of water sounds echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

“Did we not escape?” Luo Tian muttered, sensing the water pressure around him and looking about.

“This isn’t the Dead Sea!” Luo Tian sighed in relief. Though they were underwater, it wasn’t the gray water of the Dead Sea but normal seawater. As Luo Tian and the others appeared, there was no sign of the Dead Sea—seeming to materialize out of nowhere.

The sudden appearance startled a school of fish, which scattered in all directions.

“This is the Huantian Sea…” Jiang Huantian's eyes flickered, then he transmitted to Luo Tian and the others. As the island master of Huantian Island, he knew it well.

“The Huantian Sea? Did we arrive at the Upper Heavens?” Luo Tian's eyes widened with confusion.

“First, let’s go out and check. This is definitely the Huantian Sea's aura, but it spans across the Nine Heavens. If we truly are deep within it, that’s a problem!” Jiang Huantian spoke, then his body glowed as he swam upward from the seabed.

Luo Tian and the others sighed inwardly. Reaching the Upper Heavens was harder than ascending to heaven—first the Dead Sea, then the Huantian Sea. Not good places.

Yet Luo Tian hadn’t expected a Huantian Sea to be so vast, spanning the entire Immortal World.

The Huantian Sea wasn’t a joke. Though not as dangerous as the Dead Sea, it was an infamous perilous region in the Immortal World.

Fortunately, Jiang Huantian, as the island master of Huantian Island, was familiar with it. After an hour of swimming upward, they finally surfaced into the sky.

An endless sea stretched before them, its power overwhelming. Luo Tian and the others sighed deeply, their gazes filled with awe at the vast Huantian Sea.

“Immortal energy is so rich! This is the Upper Heavens!” Jiang Huantian spoke, his voice filled with excitement as he gazed at Luo Tian and the others.

“Master Jiang, do you know how to fly out?” Luo Tian asked, looking at the endless sea. It didn’t seem easier than escaping the Dead Sea.

“I have a map!” Jiang Huantian smiled, waving his hand. A map appeared in his palm, recording the Upper Heavens’ forces.

The Huantian Sea was at the southernmost end of the Upper Heavens, near Bontian Mountain. We just need to head southeast, Jiang Huantian said, taking out a compass marked with directions.

“That’s good…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. His gaze remained cautious, watching around. Who knew when a monster would appear? The Huantian Sea’s creatures were more numerous than the Dead Sea's, and there must be many powerful aquatic beasts.

“We’re now in the southeast of the Huantian Sea, near Bontian Mountain. At our speed, three days should get us back—assuming no mishaps!” Jiang Huantian’s face was grim. He took flight, leading Luo Tian and the others across the sea.

The Upper Heavens were vast, but only nine forces remained. Now it was seven. The first of the Nine Immortal Mountains, Guigu Mountain, had mysteriously vanished. The Daoist Sect’s lineage was destroyed. Now the Upper Heavens were ruled by seven forces.

The Upper Heavens had sparse populations. Only the nine Immortal Mountains’ people lived there, with few from the Middle Heavens entering. Due to the low population and abundant resources, the Upper Heavens’ mountains grew stronger than Middle Heavens’ sects. Each mountain held a supreme position in the Immortal World.

Conflicts existed between these mountains, like the Ten Courts of Yama. Their relationships were complex and intertwined.

The southeast direction of the Upper Heavens spanned millions of li, all under Bontian Mountain’s domain. Bontian Mountain stood there.

Gray peaks rose in the world, their massive bodies giving a heavy feeling. Towering mountains stretched outward, forming a gray range. This was one of the Nine Heavens’ Immortal Mountains—Bontian Mountain, standing for countless years without falling.

The mountain was lively now. Bontian Mountain was holding a competition to choose its next sect leader, a major event. Everyone prepared for it, curious about which of Bontian Immortal King’s nine sons would become the sect leader.

Other forces had internal appointments for their next leaders, directing resources toward them. But Bontian Mountain was different—each of its nine sons had a chance to become leader, with resources equally distributed. This created competition.

In a secluded peak, disciples wore respectful expressions, gazing at the wooden house atop the summit. Bontian Immortal King’s ninth son, Jiang Yuzhe, had returned from the Middle Heavens fifteen years ago. His ailments were cured, and his strength had grown.

People thought Jiang Yuzhe would withdraw from the competition. But over the years, he hadn’t lagged behind. His strength was undeniable, and with abundant resources, he had reached the late True Immortal stage.

His influence also grew gradually. Though not as strong as his brothers, he had a chance to compete.

Inside the wooden house, Jiang Yuzhe sat in white robes, his eyes showing concern.

“Seven days until the test. Where are Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying? Why haven’t they found Luo Tian?” Jiang Yuzhe muttered.

Bontian Immortal King’s test required one to bring three people, competing with other brothers. But now Luo Tian and his group hadn’t arrived. Jiang Yuzhe had already obtained a Bontian Seal for Luo Tian via special methods—only waiting for them to return.

Jiang Yuzhe wasn’t the only one anxious. Third son Jiang Yu also felt urgency, but his impatience was more explosive. Daily, he could be heard cursing.

“Someone must have plotted against us; otherwise they wouldn’t still be missing!” Jiang Yuzhe’s eyes narrowed, thinking. He stepped out of the room. If Luo Tian and his group didn’t return, he’d have to prepare two strategies.

Three days before the test, three weary figures appeared at Bontian Mountain’s gate. Their clothes were torn, and they bore many wounds—evidence of fierce battles. These three were Jiang Yu’s allies: Jiang Wuxin, Tu Shengsheng, and Jiang Dao.

Luo Tian’s group had barely left when Jiang Wuxin’s wounds healed. He also took a transmission array to the Upper Heavens, encountering the same fate as Luo Tian. However, they hadn’t been sent to the Dead Sea but a perilous place—narrowly escaping and returning to Bontian Mountain.

“Damn it, that old man must have schemed against us!” Jiang Wuxin cursed, his eyes burning with anger.

“Don’t talk. He’s an elder; we can’t fight him. Fortunately, we returned—otherwise, Master Jiang would have torn us apart!” Jiang Dao’s face was grim.

“You have the nerve to return!” As they spoke, Jiang Yu appeared before them with a cold face, sending chills through the three.

“Master, we had no choice…” Seeing Jiang Yu, Jiang Dao spoke loudly, recounting the events—losing two Bontian Seals.

“You… are dead!” Jiang Yu’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected so many problems.

“Go back and find a way!” Jiang Yu’s eyes flashed with determination. He thought of a plan.

Time passed slowly. Two days had gone by, but Luo Tian’s group hadn’t arrived at Bontian Mountain. Jiang Yuzhe made a decision, taking out a token to send a transmission.

Soon, three figures stood outside Jiang Yuzhe’s courtyard. Two middle-aged men and a youth—middle-aged men were True Immortal peak, the youth was late True Immortal.

These three were Jiang Yuzhe’s chosen allies. If Luo Tian’s group didn’t return, they would replace him in the test.

“Bao Qing, Tang Liangping, Song Zhiming. No matter the result of this test, I promise you three rewards!” Jiang Yuzhe sighed deeply. With only one day left until the test, he had no hope.

“Master, rest assured! We’ll do our best!” The three’s eyes glowed with excitement as they vowed to Jiang Yuzhe.

“Hmph. Brother Zexi, tomorrow’s competition—nervous?” As Jiang Yuzhe spoke with the three, Jiang Yu arrived at his courtyard with Jiang Dao and others.

“Third brother, why are you so free today? Come to my place?” Jiang Yuzhe frowned, gazing at Jiang Yu and seeing Jiang Dao behind him.

“Ninth brother, your three people also had problems, right? Want revenge?” Jiang Yu addressed Jiang Yuzhe.

“Third brother, you were also tricked. Let’s settle this separately!” Jiang Yuzhe replied.

“ I came to ask for something from you, ninth brother. I’ll help you settle the debt with the second brother!”

“Now you have one Bontian Seal. You probably don’t have much hope. Why not give it to me?” Jiang Yu’s eyes gazed at Jiang Yuzhe.

Chapter 2260: Schemes for the Bontian Seal

Hearing Jiang Yu’s words, Jiang Yuzhe’s brow furrowed. He didn’t know why Jiang Yu wanted his Bontian Seal.

Previously, Jiang Yu had taken one of Luo Tian’s Bontian Seals in Huantian City. Now there were four, and more wouldn’t be useful.

“Did Jiang Dao’s group lose their Bontian Seals too?” Jiang Yuzhe wondered but kept his expression calm, replying to Jiang Yu: “Third brother, do you think I’d give my Bontian Seal to you?”

“No…” Jiang Yuzhe shook his head, not angry but gazing at the three—Bao Qing, Tang Liangping, and Song Zhiming.

“However, ninth brother, you don’t think these three wastes can beat us, do you? You’re too young. I’ll pay a price to exchange your Bontian Seal!”

“Never mind, I don’t need your仙气石 and仙晶. Third brother, buy some supplements instead. You’ve been angry a lot lately—replenish your energy!” Jiang Yuzhe replied, then ignored Jiang Yu and entered his courtyard. Bao Qing and the others nodded at Jiang Yu before heading to their quarters.

“This won’t be my fault!” Jiang Yu smiled as he watched Jiang Yuzhe leave, then led Jiang Dao and others to his quarters.

Time passed slowly. Another day had gone by. The next morning, a heavy bell rang across Bontian Mountain.

Numerous disciples wore anticipation as they headed toward the mountain’s main peak.

At the summit, a high platform rose. Crowds gathered below, gazing at the platform.

“Make way!” As people crowded, a figure walked in from outside. His face was rugged, his body tall. Behind him were three strong men, radiating powerful auras.

Wherever the strong man went, Bontian Mountain disciples bowed respectfully, saying: “Hail to the First Brother!”

Jiang Yulong, Bontian Immortal King’s eldest son. His age looked like forty or fifty, as if middle-aged.

“Boom…” Jiang Yulong’s massive body stepped onto the platform. He sneered: “My younger brothers really know when to choose—none want to go first!”

“Is this the First Brother’s allies? A half-Immortal King and two True Immortal peaks!”

“Look, that big man isn’t the disciple of Hundred Battles Sect from the Middle Heavens, Chen Baini?” People murmured, gazing at Jiang Yulong and his three men. They recognized their identities.

Jiang Yuzhe could find allies from Star River Mansion; others naturally could too. Other sects were willing to help these princes compete, as if their supported person became the next leader, it would bring great benefits to them and their sects.

“First brother came early. So eager, huh?” As Bontian Mountain disciples murmured, a soft voice echoed in their ears. It made them shiver.

People parted as a figure walked out of the crowd. His face was pale, his body could be described as slender. If not known, one might think he was a woman—especially a beauty. But his voice betrayed him: it was a man’s, and he had a Adam's apple.

“Second brother, Jiang Yufeng…” People murmured, gazing at the figure walking out. Their eyes showed respect.

Jiang Yufeng’s back had three people—some from Bontian Mountain itself, others disciples of Middle Heavens sects.

“Elder brother came early. So eager!” Jiang Yulong’s face changed slightly, addressing Jiang Yufeng. He sighed inwardly at his father for giving this brother such a name.

“Looks like I’m not the last!” As Jiang Yufeng stepped onto the platform, Jiang Yu laughed and walked out of the crowd. This caused people to gasp.

As Jiang Yu emerged, Bontian Immortal King’s other sons also walked out of the crowd. However, they weren’t as dramatic as Jiang Yu and his group, since while their strength was good, it paled compared to Jiang Yu’s three.

“Elder brother, second brother, third brother…” The brothers greeted Jiang Yu and his group. They were open-minded, knowing they wouldn’t become sect leaders, so they only symbolically found friends.

As the crowd arrived, people were stunned. Their faces showed admiration as they gazed at Jiang Yu and his group on the platform.

“That’s a disciple of One Sky Bai Family! He's friends with my sixth brother!”
“Tiancan Valley’s disciple also came…” People murmured, watching the people behind the princes. Though these people were from the Middle Heavens, Bontian Mountain disciples recognized them—these would be future sect leaders.

“Only ninth brother is missing!” Jiang Yulong and the others frowned, their eyes showing impatience.

“Probably ninth brother is still looking for people!” Jiang Yufeng smiled, gazing into the distance.

“Elder brother, did you mess with my people?” Jiang Yu sneered, gazing at Jiang Yufeng. Among the brothers, Jiang Yufeng was the one who loved scheming.

“Elder third brother, what are you saying? I don’t understand!” Jiang Yufeng replied, ignoring Jiang Yu. He gazed at the crowd.

The crowd parted as Jiang Yuzhe walked out with three allies. Now that Luo Tian’s group hadn’t returned, he had no choice but to go ahead.

“Ninth brother, your allies are so weak. Should I help you find a better one?” Jiang Yu sneered.

“No need!” Jiang Yuzhe spoke softly, stepping onto the platform. But only one of his three allies joined him.

“Why are you two like this?” Jiang Yuzhe frowned, sensing a bad premonition.

“Master Jiang Yuzhe, I’m unwell. I might not be able to help!”
“I’m the same, Master Jiang Yuzhe. You should find someone else!” Bao Wenqing and Tang Liangping addressed Jiang Yuzhe.

“You…!” Jiang Yuzhe’s face darkened. He stared coldly at them, their eyes flickering away.

“Good, good, good!” Jiang Yuzhe said three times, suppressing his anger. He addressed Bao Wenqing: “Give me the Bontian Seal! I don’t need you!”

“Ninth brother, if you were me, you’d quit!” Jiang Yufeng sneered, his soft voice addressing Jiang Yuzhe.

Jiang Yuzhe’s patience was exhausted. Bontian Immortal King had many wives, and he was the son of his favorite wife. But after birth, that wife died, so he had been bullied since childhood.

Jiang Yulong and the others’ mothers hated his mother, so they often targeted Jiang Yuzhe. But Bontian Immortal King treated them equally. Jiang Yuzhe’s status in Bontian Mountain was that of a prince.

Jiang Yuzhe’s face darkened. The test required three allies, but with such short time, he couldn’t find them. If he chose two randomly, it would be giving his brothers heads.

But Jiang Yuzhe was unwilling to give up. He had worked so hard to show them he wasn’t a pushover.

“Ninth brother, quit…” A young man sighed deeply, addressing Jiang Yuzhe. Among the brothers, these few who didn’t seek power were kind to him.

“Master Jiang, sorry we’re late!” As Jiang Yuzhe didn’t know whether to continue, a loud voice echoed from outside the crowd. Three weary figures pushed through the crowd and appeared in sight.

“Jiang Huantian!”
“Sima Feiying, disciple of the Middle Heavens’ Flying Eagle Sect!”
“Who is this? I’ve never seen him before!” People gasped, finally focusing on the unfamiliar Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s group returned from Huantian Sea but wasn’t peaceful. They had slain several True Immortal peak aquatic beasts and encountered a half-Immortal King-level water dragon, which they killed before escaping Huantian Sea.

Upon returning, they immediately came to the main peak without changing clothes. Their bodies still smelled of fish, and their faces were blackened, like three fishermen.

“Haha, came in a hurry!” Jiang Yuzhe’s face lit up with joy as he descended and led them to the platform.

“Luo Tian! How didn’t you die!” Jiang Wuxin gritted his teeth, gazing at the weary Luo Tian.

“Master Song, you don’t need to participate. But I’ll still pay your reward!” Jiang Yuzhe addressed Song Zhiming, who stood there.

“Yes!” Song Zhiming said nothing. He wouldn’t have to do anything for a generous reward—such good fortune was rare.

Luo Tian’s group stood behind Jiang Yuzhe, gazing at the others with a hint of amusement. He recognized some among them.

“Bai Tian, disciple of One Sky Bai Family! Qin Hefeng from Tiancan Valley…” Luo Tian recognized these two. As for the others, he knew them but had forgotten their names—after all, they were from Bontian City.

Chapter 2261: Immortal Ruins

Seeing Luo Tian on the platform, disciples who had visited Bontian City showed disbelief.

“He’s still alive!” Qin Hefeng exclaimed, his mind recalling Luo Tian’s supposed death. He hadn’t returned from the underworld in two years.

“Luo Tian, brother!” Bai Tian smiled, his eyes showing joy. He remembered when Luo Tian had helped him with the Ghost-Repelling Pills, removing his ghostly qi. At that time, he had treated Luo Tian as a common friend.

While the disciples recognized Luo Tian, they also transmitted to Jiang Yulong and others about Luo Tian’s events in Bontian City.

“Ah, he's the one from Star River Mansion who led people to quell the chaos!” Jiang Yulong and others thought, but didn’t take Luo Tian seriously.

“Jiang Yu!” Luo Tian’s eyes saw Jiang Yu, flashing coldness. He remembered Jiang Yu’s haughty attitude in Huantian City.
