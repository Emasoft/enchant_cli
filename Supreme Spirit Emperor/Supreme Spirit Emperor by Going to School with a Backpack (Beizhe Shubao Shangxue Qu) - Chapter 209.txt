“Am I not a dog…” Diao Dezhu shouted, his voice brimming with endless fury.

Chapter 933: The Whereabouts of Chen Yunting

Within the territory of the Rhino Clan, Luo Tian bore a glimmer of anticipation on his face as he placed a jade pendant before Diao Dezhu, who had taken his true form—a purple-furred badger.

Diao Dezhu’s eyes burned with unrelenting anger, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian. “You are insulting a noble Mysterious Ghost Badger!”

“Brother Diao, please help me find someone. This person is of great importance to me!” Luo Tian’s face was solemn, his eyes filled with entreaty.

Diao Dezhu’s black eyes darted nervously, unwilling to yield. Yet seeing Luo Tian’s resolute expression, his heart clenched—Luo Tian was serious.

“Why should I? You’ve insulted me repeatedly. Why should I help you? You’re dreaming!” Diao Dezhu recalled his near capture on the Fengshen Continent and today’s misfortune, shaking his purple head. His claws gleamed with cold light as he combed through his glistening fur.

“Do you really think so highly of yourself, Diao Dezhu? Have you forgotten where you are?” Gu Lei’s face curled into a smirk as he clenched his fists, the sound of cracking bones echoing.

“Zhan Biao, tonight we’ll eat half-step Saint’s badger meat!” Xu Lizi Yi grinned, stepping before Luo Tian.

“Hah! This little pest isn’t even worth my mouthful!” Chen Zhan Biao chuckled, his face showing disdain but circling Diao Dezhu.

When the crowd saw Luo Tian produce his Nourishing Soul Jade, they knew Diao Dezhu would aid him in finding Chen Yunting. They understood that Chen Yunting had become a torment for Luo Tian, and without her, he might spend his life burdened by guilt.

“You dare to attack a noble Mysterious Ghost Badger!” Diao Dezhu, surrounded by the group, grew flustered. Seeing their mocking eyes, he finally showed fear, shrinking his short neck as violet energy flickered—seeking to transform into human form.

But they gave him no chance. Wan Lingkong waved his hand, golden formation flags encircling Diao Dezhu, radiating waves that formed a golden circle around his neck.

“Damn it! What is this? You really think I’m a dog?” Diao Dezhu cried out, but the sealing force prevented his transformation and gradually sealed his cultivation.

“I am not a dog! You insult me. I am a noble Mysterious Ghost Badger and will never submit to you!” Diao Dezhu stood defiant, eyes closed, as if saying, “Do what you will.”

“Hmph. Even now you’re so stubborn. You really are an idiot. I thought we had a connection, but apparently, you’re just a fool!” Zheng Xin sneered, patting Diao Dezhu’s head like one would a dog.

“Snarl…” A flash of cold light. Seeing Zheng Xin’s treatment, Diao Dezhu bared his teeth, eyes filled with intent to bite.

“Hah! You claim not to be a dog but want to bite people!” The crowd burst into laughter, watching Diao Dezhu’s growing fury.

The Rhino Clan members wore expressions of confusion. Their memories had been erased, so seeing Diao Dezhu treated thusly, they bore shock.

“Since when has Diao Dezhu endured such treatment? What happened? Why can’t I remember?” The Rhino Clan members exchanged puzzled glances.

“Boom…” As the Rhino Clan members wore confusion, a heavy sound and a cry jolted them back to reality. Their mouths twitched.

In view, Long Jie’s face was icy as he seized Diao Dezhu’s purple tail, lifting his small body and smashing him onto the ground.

The impact cracked the earth. Diao Dezhu howled in agony, begging for mercy.

“Long… Master… Please let me go!” Diao Dezhu howled, knowing even if Long Jie killed him, his grandfather would ignore it. Though Long Jie hadn’t drawn blood, this was truly painful. Moreover, his noble image was ruined.

“Stop! Luo Tian, make your brother stop before he causes a big trouble. He’s the young master of the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan—no one in the Demon Realm dares to provoke him. Please apologize!” Xin Hongda finally couldn’t bear it, fearing Long Jie would cause trouble.

“Boom… Help or not?” Long Jie coldly spoke, his voice devoid of emotion. He smashed Diao Dezhu again to the ground. His purple fur scattered.

“Help… You’re my ancestor! I’ll help, okay!” Diao Dezhu groaned in surrender.

“Boom…” Long Jie gazed at Diao Dezhu, pointing to Luo Tian. “He’s my elder brother. His words are mine. Got it? Drop your nobility—it means nothing to me!”

“Yes, yes!” Diao Dezhu smiled sycophantically, inwardly comforting himself: “A good badger doesn’t fight the immediate danger. I’ll miss my fur.”

“Why did you suffer so? Why not just do it earlier!” Gu Lei and others laughed heartily.

The Rhino Clan was utterly bewildered. Remembering Diao Dezhu’s past arrogance in the Demon Realm, they saw Luo Tian’s group now acting like a lapdog. Instantly, the Mysterious Ghost Badger’s noble image vanished.

“Hey, take this thing off my neck. It’s uncomfortable!”

Diao Dezhu glared at Wan Lingkong, his face filled with anger.

“Leave it for now. I don’t want you to pull tricks. It’s cute this way!” The group refused to remove it.

No matter how Diao Dezhu resisted or swore, the group unanimously rejected him. Finally, Long Jie waved his hand, and Diao Dezhu obediently wore it.

“Trouble,” Luo Tian said with a hint of anticipation, placing the Nourishing Soul Jade before Diao Dezhu again.

“Cough… cough…” Diao Dezhu awkwardly coughed, then bit down on the jade with determination.

“Hah! Your name matches your actions. I wonder how your father and grandfather named you! Diao Dezhu, you’ve got guts!” The crowd laughed heartily. At this moment, Diao Dezhu looked no different from a dog.

“Hum…” Diao Dezhu seemed to have made up his mind, abandoning all dignity. His black eyes flashed with runes as his black nose sniffed constantly.

“Quiet…” Luo Tian quickly scolded, watching the purple badger with anticipation.

Seeing Luo Tian’s tension, people wisely fell silent, all watching Diao Dezhu intently.

For a full quarter of an hour, purple runes enveloped the Nourishing Soul Jade. Diao Dezhu’s mouth drooled from holding it so long.

“Huff…” The purple runes entered Diao Dezhu’s nose. Under the group’s expectant gaze, he finally spat out the saliva-drenched Nourishing Soul Jade, which returned to Luo Tian’s side.

“Disgusting!” Luo Tian grimaced, looking at the saliva-covered jade. A chill ran up his spine. Yet thinking of finding Chen Yunting, he became excited. He wiped the jade on himself and pocketed it, eyes filled with anticipation waiting for Diao Dezhu to speak.

“You’re looking for someone in the Demon Realm, and she’s right here in this Holy City!” Diao Dezhu said with pride, lifting his head as if it were no challenge.

“Boom…” Hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light. He grabbed Diao Dezhu and held him tightly.

“Did you say that’s true?” Luo Tian’s voice trembled with excitement and disbelief, gazing at Diao Dezhu.

“Ridiculous. You’re insulting me. If you don’t believe me, I can take you to her right now!” Diao Dezhu seemed stimulated, patting his chest with a claw.

“Good!” Luo Tian was overjoyed. He longed to see Chen Yunting immediately, regardless of being in the Demon Realm.

“Luo Tian, don’t be hasty. This is the Demon Realm. Think—if Chen Yunting has reincarnated as a fierce beast, and beasts need to awaken their intelligence and reach the Soul-Formation stage. How long has she been reincarnated? Just a few years! You…” Xu Lizi Yi looked worried, addressing Luo Tian.

“I don’t care what she’s reincarnated into. I’ll have her by my side. No more harm will touch her!” Luo Tian’s eyes were resolute, shouting as he grabbed the purple Diao Dezhu and flew into the sky.

“Lead the way!” Luo Tian released Diao Dezhu, telling everyone to wait at the Rhino Clan. He followed Diao Dezhu toward the city’s center.

“Kid, don’t worry. In the Demon Realm, nothing is beyond my reach. Once we find who you seek, just take her!” Diao Dezhu said with pride, leading Luo Tian toward the largest inn in the Holy City.

Holy Beast Pavilion—The grandest inn in the Holy City, a joint venture of eight saintly clans. It was bustling with activity, housing fierce beasts and humans alike due to the ancient heavenly palace and Demon Realm auction. Humans of high status from other realms were also present.

Grand Elder Sun Hefeng and Divine Princess Sun Mengru, of the Divine Clan, were too esteemed to care about other places. They resided in the Holy Beast Pavilion.

At that moment, Sun Mengru sat cross-legged in a spacious room, her aura radiating power.

“Boom…” Suddenly, Sun Mengru felt her heart race. She slowly opened her eyes, confusion in them.

Chapter 934: Reunion

The Holy Beast Pavilion, the largest inn in the Demon Realm’s Holy City, occupied a vast area rivaling the Rhino Clan’s territory. It was equally bustling.

At that moment, Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu stood in the sky. Diao Dezhu had regained his purple robe, appearing as a human, though a golden circle still encircled his neck—infuriating him.

“First off, if you find her, take this thing off my neck. It really ruins my noble image!” Diao Dezhu said impatiently.

Luo Tian nodded. His vast spiritual awareness spread outward, scanning the Holy Beast Pavilion with urgency. He was certain that if his spiritual sense touched her, he would know immediately.

“Hum…” But soon, Luo Tian became disappointed. His spiritual sense was blocked by an invisible barrier outside the Holy Beast Pavilion.

“Don’t waste your effort. The Holy Beast Pavilion is protected by a barrier set up jointly by the eight saintly clans. Even late-stage saints can’t penetrate it. Let me take you instead!” Diao Dezhu said with pride, darting into the inn.

Luo Tian followed closely. As soon as he entered, he felt several powerful auras brushing against his mind.

“Hey! Master Diao, I’m here. Get someone to welcome me!” Diao Dezhu shouted without restraint upon entering the inn’s grand hall, causing people to frown slightly. However, when fierce beasts recognized Diao Dezhu, their faces changed, and they kept a distance.

“Master Diao, what brings you here?” A fierce beast in the Ultimate Stage appeared before Diao Dezhu, his face filled with reverence.

Diao Dezhu’s name had spread across the Demon Realm in recent years. As a descendant of the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan, no one dared to provoke him. Once, someone offended Diao Dezhu and was wiped out by Master Diao Yuanshan. The entire clan perished, leaving no survivors. From then on, even other clans of the eight saintly tribes dared not provoke Diao Dezhu.

“Looking for someone. Follow me. If there’s anything, I’ll tell you!” Diao Dezhu said with pride, striding confidently.

The attendant dared not delay, smiling sycophantically as he followed Diao Dezhu. He sighed inwardly, wondering who would be unlucky today.

Luo Tian followed Diao Dezhu closely, his heart pounding with tension. Passing through buildings, they finally arrived before a grand hall.

“Who lives inside?” Diao Dezhu pointed at the magnificent building, asking the attendant.

“I don’t know. An old man and a young woman. Their every movement suggests they’re no ordinary people. Master Diao, you know the Demon Realm is chaotic now. The old man spends generously; we dared not offend him. Those who live in the Holy Beast Pavilion aren’t ordinary people!” The attendant quickly explained.

Luo Tian’s heart was excited. He knew Diao Dezhu had found the place, and Chen Yunting’s reincarnation likely lived here.

“Why is my heart beating so fast? Why am I feeling nervous?” Sun Mengru, puzzled, stood up and walked around her room.

“Inside! I am Diao Dezhu. If you’re wise, come out respectfully. If not, I’ll barge in!” Diao Dezhu shouted loudly, his voice echoing throughout the Holy Beast Pavilion, startling people.

Luo Tian couldn’t wait. He unleashed his spiritual sense into the building, scanning for Chen Yunting’s reincarnation.

At the same time, Sun Mengru heard Diao Dezhu’s arrogant voice. Her brows furrowed as she extended her spiritual sense to investigate.

Luo Tian and Sun Mengru’s spiritual senses collided unintentionally. Luo Tian trembled, his eyes glistening with tears. He clenched his fists tightly and moved to rush into the building.

But the Holy Beast Pavilion was a joint venture of eight saintly clans. It wouldn’t risk guests’ safety. As Luo Tian rushed out, he was violently thrown back, spitting blood.

“Boom…” The heavy sound echoed throughout the Holy Beast Pavilion. Guests looked surprised, gathering at Sun Mengru’s residence.

Sun Mengru felt a shock upon touching Luo Tian’s spiritual sense. Her body trembled, confusion in her eyes as an unusually familiar aura stirred within her.

“Who is he? Why do I feel this way?” Sun Mengru felt agitated but didn’t leave her room. She knew Sun Hefeng would handle it. Calming herself, she extended her spiritual sense to observe the situation.

Luo Tian’s face was anxious as he addressed Diao Dezhu: “Take me in!”

“Alright,” Diao Dezhu knew Luo Tian was anxious. He nodded, extending his hand. Purple energy flowed from it, forming a purple blade that sliced toward the door of Sun Mengru’s residence.

But as the blade approached the invisible barrier, a voice echoed from within. An old man emerged, radiating golden light—Sun Hefeng, Grand Elder of the Divine Clan with late-stage saint cultivation.

“Unknown guests. What business do you have with us?” Sun Hefeng smiled, but his expression darkened upon seeing Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian!” Sun Hefeng’s eyes flashed with killing intent, but upon seeing the fierce beasts surrounding Luo Tian, he asked.

“Enemy!” Luo Tian felt Sun Hefeng’s killing intent and his face changed. The old man’s cultivation was clearly late-stage saint, making Luo Tian feel quite challenged.

“Damn it, Luo Tian. Your taste is really heavy!” Diao Dezhu saw the old man and was shocked. Seeing their mutual gaze, though others didn’t notice, Diao Dezhu deduced Luo Tian sought the old man.

“Divine Clan?” Luo Tian felt uneasy. If Sun Mengru had reincarnated into the Divine Clan, it would be problematic.

“Within the Demon Realm, are you always the one who gives orders?” Luo Tian asked Diao Dezhu, his gaze deep.

“Of course. Who doesn’t know the Holy City’s Master Diao? How many dare defy me in the Holy City?” Diao Dezhu, hearing Luo Tian’s questioning tone, felt reluctant. His eyes glowed with pride.

“Can you kill a late-stage saint?” Luo Tian’s face showed hope as he asked Diao Dezhu again.

“Late-stage saint? That’s definitely…” Diao Dezhu nearly agreed but then realized Luo Tian’s words. His face turned pale, staring at Luo Tian as if seeing a ghost.

“Did I hear right? What the hell are you saying? You want to kill a late-stage saint!” Diao Dezhu’s black eyes stared at Luo Tian, as if looking at a fool.

Luo Tian saw Diao Dezhu’s expression and knew his idea was impossible. A late-stage saint, especially a Divine Clan one—killing him would ignite a war between the Divine Clan and the Demon Realm.

“I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, not avoiding it but stating his name directly.

“An impressive young man. Your courage is admirable. You’ve come to my place—what do you need? Don’t tell me you’re here to die!” Sun Hefeng smiled but a killing aura radiated from him, sweeping over Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu.

“Old man, stop showing off. Though I can’t kill you, you shouldn’t provoke me. Believe me, I’ll have you leave the Demon Realm right now!” Diao Dezhu felt the old man’s killing intent and turned cold.

“Hey, who did we offend?” A teasing voice echoed. Two young men, as carefree as Diao Dezhu, entered the scene, causing Diao Dezhu to smile.

“Long Liu, Xiao Peng, why are you here?” Diao Dezhu smiled at them.

“We were bored. We went to your house, and your grandfather said you went to the Rhino Clan. So we found our way here!” Dressed in blue, a clear aura entered Luo Tian’s nose, startling him.

“Hah! Just in time. This old man just had killing intent toward me. Watch how you deal with it!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes darted, addressing them.

“Get lost. We know that! Late-stage saint? You want to drag us into it. That’s really shameless. Brothers are brothers, but we won’t take the blame!” They laughed and stood beside Diao Dezhu.

“Grand Elder, what’s happening?” A melodious voice echoed into people’s ears. Sun Mengru appeared with a puzzled expression, standing before Sun Hefeng, her brows furrowed.

Luo Tian trembled. His eyes never left Sun Mengru. Upon seeing her, he was certain she was Chen Yunting’s reincarnation.

“Go back. I’ll handle it!” Sun Hefeng smiled, addressing Sun Mengru with affection. He had raised her since childhood, initially out of duty but later truly loved her like a granddaughter.

A faint sigh crossed his eyes. Sun Hefeng knew the fate of the Divine Clan’s princess and softened further.

“Yes…” Sun Mengru respectfully replied, her eyes meeting Luo Tian’s. Her feet felt like lead.

Finally, she wore a sorrowful expression. Though she wanted to ask if Luo Tian knew her, she didn’t. Her slender figure disappeared from view.

“Wait!” Luo Tian stared intently at Sun Mengru, speaking instinctively as she tried to leave.

“What? Kid, are you going to attack us?” Sun Hefeng’s face turned cold. His killing intent surged again, forming an invisible storm that struck Luo Tian, forcing him to retreat.

Sun Hefeng was truly angry. Luo Tian had repeatedly provoked the Divine Clan. If not for being in the Demon Realm, he would already be dead. Sun Hefeng knew Sun Mengru’s fate and cherished her like a granddaughter. Seeing Luo Tian target her, his face finally showed ferocity. His late-stage saint cultivation radiated power, shaking the Holy Beast Pavilion.

“Late-stage saint…” People’s eyes widened in fear. They gazed at Sun Hefeng, surprised he was a late-stage saint.

The Demon Realm revered strength. Facing a late-stage saint, even fierce beasts showed respect.

“Leave! I can’t touch you in the Demon Realm. If you leave, it’s your death!” Sun Hefeng coldly spoke, his voice filled with severity.

“Hah! Arrogant. Truly arrogant. No wonder the Divine Clan is so bold. Rare to see such audacity!” A teasing voice echoed. Behind Luo Tian, Diao Dezhu and two young men emerged, looking at Sun Hefeng with disdain.

“Dragon Clan, Phoenix Clan, Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan!” Sun Hefeng frowned slightly.

“Good eyes. To be honest, our brothers have taken an interest in your girl and want to marry her. Can you agree? I advise you to accept, since it’s inevitable,” Diao Dezhu’s companion Long Yongfu sneered at the old man.

“Dragon Clan’s sixth prince, Long Yongfu; Golden-winged Great Peng Clan’s young master, Jin Le Shu; Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan’s Diao Dezhu. These three villains have clashed with a late-stage saint!” Fierce beasts in human forms looked shocked, gazing at Diao Dezhu and the others.

“Old man, do you know where this is? This is the Holy Beast Pavilion. I declare: you can’t stay here, find another place!” Diao Dezhu shouted at the attendant.

“Ah… yes…” The attendant quickly apologized to Sun Hefeng, “Sir, this is a joint venture of the eight saintly clans. The owner said you should find another place!”

Sun Hefeng’s face darkened. He was now in a difficult position. If he left, he’d lose face; if he stayed, the inn could legally ask him to leave. If he fought, it would escalate in a joint venture of the eight saintly clans.

“Three fools really are rotten together!” Before the Divine Clan elder could speak, another teasing voice echoed. Three young men emerged from the crowd.

“Phoenix Clan’s young master, Feng Jiutian; Tiger Clan’s young master, Hu Xiangyang! And Lion Clan’s young master, Shi Hongtu! They’ve also arrived. Now there’s a show. These three and Diao Dezhu have always clashed!” Fierce beasts who lived in the Holy City knew these three were background threats—true princes of the Demon Realm.

They often formed groups, clashing frequently. Now, against this old man from the Divine Clan, Feng Jiutian and others showed such a stance.

“Feng Jiutian, what do you mean? I’m not in the mood to fight today. Get lost and don’t bother me!” Diao Dezhu’s face turned cold, addressing the red-cloaked man.

“Hah! Business? I’d like to see what business you’re doing. This is a joint venture of the eight saintly clans. Who gave you the right to decide?” Feng Jiutian waved a red fan, sneering.

“Exactly. You want to chase this old man out. I’ll stay here. What can you do?” Hu Xiangyang sneered, his voice filled with pressure.

Diao Dezhu’s face darkened. Though they had clashed before, it was internal conflict. They usually stood united against humans. Now, Feng Jiutian and others treated the Divine Clan’s old man this way.

“Let’s go,” Luo Tian shook his head, knowing it wasn’t the time for conflict. His eyes held reluctance, gazing at Sun Mengru who had returned to her room. He addressed Diao Dezhu and the others.

Chen Yunting clearly didn’t recognize him. Sun Hefeng wouldn’t allow a private meeting with her. Though they could pressure Sun Hefeng through Diao Dezhu and others, it was only a pressure. They couldn’t do anything to the late-stage saint Sun Hefeng unless the Demon Realm and Divine Clan tore apart. Could that happen? The Demon Realm wouldn’t risk it for him.

“Take it slow. There will be a chance. I’ll awaken your memories of the past and make you remember me!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, determination in his eyes. He also felt urgency—learning from Jiang Sixi that the Divine Clan’s princess never had a good fate, he was worried about Chen Yunting.

The only comfort for Luo Tian was finally finding Chen Yunting’s whereabouts. No longer would he search aimlessly across realms.

“There’s nothing else. I’ll rest,” Sun Hefeng said, his face dark as he walked into the building.

Sun Hefeng was angry. These little brats called him “old man,” angering him to the core. If not for their status, he would’ve slapped them all to death.

“Let him go like that?” Diao Dezhu’s face showed disbelief. He thought of the arrogant Luo Tian from the Fengshen Continent—this Luo Tian was nothing like his memory.

“Let’s just say there’ll be a chance,” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, gazing at Feng Jiutian and others.

“What about them? Should I help you deal with them?” Luo Tian smiled, his gaze unkind toward Feng Jiutian.

“Hah! A joke. A mere Superhuman Stage person dares to claim he can deal with us?” Feng Jiutian and others laughed heartily, as if hearing the best joke in the world.

Diao Dezhu’s face changed. His black eyes flickered with a brief glimmer of fear, pulling Luo Tian and Long Yongfu and Jin Le Shu: “Don’t argue with them. Let’s go get a drink!”

Diao Dezhu said and pulled the three out of the crowd. Hu Chengyang and Long Yongfu were stunned, unable to understand why Diao Dezhu—usually the first to charge and ignite—would do this now.

“Hah! Diao Dezhu rarely meets, but you don’t even want to bleed?” Diao Dezhu’s brief fear was seen by Feng Jiutian and others as concern for Luo Tian.

“What do you want?” Diao Dezhu stopped, his face angry as he looked at Feng Jiutian. “Do you want to fight again? Today, I’m not in the mood!”

“Hah! Fighting is crude. After all, we are eight saintly clans. Constant fighting would harm our relations. How about a different game?” Feng Jiutian smiled, scanning Luo Tian.

“Hmph! What tricks do you have? I’ll play along!” Diao Dezhu seemed provoked, his face flushed as he addressed Feng Jiutian.

“Brave indeed. No wonder the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan!”

“Here’s the deal: I’ve been short on funds lately. Two days before the auction, how about a small bet? I have human friends; let’s have them compete. One match decides it.” Feng Jiutian smiled playfully, scanning Luo Tian with a taunting tone.
