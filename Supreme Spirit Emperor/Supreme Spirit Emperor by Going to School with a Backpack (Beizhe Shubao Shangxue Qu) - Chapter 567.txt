“Mo Yang has vanished!” The people’s faces bore expressions of disbelief, rubbing their eyes in disbelief.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, his face darkened, his gaze fixed on the direction of the Northern Tribe.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian muttered under his breath, then leapt into the air, rushing toward the Southern Tribe’s direction.

“Is he trying to kill me?!” Luo Tian roared internally, his spirit trembling.

After nine years, Luo Tian had completely absorbed Mo Yang, and his strength was but a single step away from reaching the late stage of True Immortality. This one step wasn’t due to any other reason—it was because of the supreme yang energy within Mo Yang.

Though the black flames upon Mo Yang had vanished, traces of its essence—fire poison—remained.

Luo Tian, as a man, had great resistance to fire poison. But the accumulated toxicity within Mo Yang was terrifying; even Luo Tian could not endure it, and this fire poison had prevented him from reaching the late stage of True Immortality.

The only way to break free from this fire poison was…

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed internally, his speed swift as he flew through the sky.

On another side, Mo Yue also shattered apart. Sudan faced the same situation; his face darkened, and after biting his lip, he flew toward Luo Tian’s direction.

Both rushed toward each other. Within half an hour, they met, both bodies flushed red, their eyes filled with wild desire.

“Roar…” Luo Tian let out a low growl, instantly appearing beside Suden, his lips pressing against hers.

They ignited like dry tinder and blazing fire, collapsing to the ground, finding a cave to erect an aura. They tore at each other’s clothes without hesitation.

“No!” Luo Tian’s mind flashed with several figures, and he pushed Sudan away, his eyes briefly clear. But this clarity was quickly overtaken by desire.

“We… can’t do this…” Luo Tian’s body trembled violently, his voice trembling as he spoke to Suden who approached.

“Not like this… neither of us will be safe! Perhaps we’ll suffer from fire poison. This is the Reincarnation Realm; outside, nothing happens! I’m a woman who isn’t afraid—what are you afraid of?!” Suden, bold and domineering, pushed Luo Tian onto the ground.

“I said… we could find another way…” Luo Tian groaned, suddenly recalling how he had resolved the issue with Fu Xingxuan before. He recounted the process to Suden.

“If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I’d have thought you weren’t a man!” Suden’s face was red, his body burning with heat. Thinking of Luo Tian’s method made him feel ashamed, but he followed it anyway, his lips descending.

Outside the cave, as if revealing why Mo Yang and Mo Yue had vanished, the earth suddenly radiated with vitality. The cave was also filled with springtime warmth.

A day passed unnoticed, and two surging energies burst from the cave. A massive vortex emerged from the cave, rapidly absorbing the ghost qi of the Northern and Southern Tribes.

Luo Tian and Suden sat cross-legged inside the cave, their clothes already on.澎湃 ghost qi continuously flowed into their bodies.

“Crack…” Two sharp sounds, as if everything was natural, their auras stabilized at the late stage of True Immortality.

Luo Tian’s face bore a bitter smile, thinking back to the events of last night. If Fu Xingxuan knew, he might have his skin peeled off.

“Sorry… I had no choice!” Luo Tian looked at Suden’s red lips, involuntarily recalling.

“Your method was good; I felt very comfortable last night!” Suden said carelessly, grabbing Luo Tian’s chin with her hand and pressing her lips against his.

“Remember, this was just a dream. We were merely having a dream. Once we leave, I’ll still be me, and you’ll still be you!” Suden smiled lightly, a strange sadness welling in her heart.

“Okay…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. No matter the reason, he knew Suden had left a deep imprint in his heart.

“Next, consolidate our cultivation. I think the Reincarnation Pool is about to end!” Luo Tian spoke softly, watching Suden’s indifferent gaze. He mentally cursed himself for his wandering thoughts.

They walked side by side out of the cave, stepping into the world outside. As soon as they emerged, several streaks of light shot through the sky, causing their faces to slightly change.

“Zhang Tiantian!” Luo Tian instantly recognized the flying figure, and Suden’s brow furrowed slightly.

“He’s behind them—those figures have no life!” Suden spoke softly, watching the withered figures behind Zhang Tiantian.

Chapter 2158: Organization ()

Under the black sky, Zhang Tiantian’s face bore exhaustion. His body was riddled with wounds, especially a claw mark on his chest that nearly pierced his heart.

“Damn it!”

“How did they turn like this?!” Zhang Tiantian cursed internally, gazing at the figures behind him. Originally, he and others had found a place to cultivate. He was about to break through to the middle stage of True Immortality, but just as he prepared to do so, several withered corpses rushed toward him.

Zhang Tiantian immediately recognized these people as fellow disciples of the Reincarnation Sect, but their eyes were lifeless, and their bodies had no vitality—only withered flesh.

Without a word, the corpses attacked Zhang Tiantian. Though his strength was good, he was only at the middle stage of True Immortality. These corpses’ flesh was impossibly strong, leaving him helpless and barely escaping with heavy injuries.

Zhang Tiantian dashed about like a fly without a head, but he found that all the disciples of the Reincarnation Sect around him had vanished.

“What happened?!” Zhang Tiantian shouted internally, dashing about frantically. He knew he couldn’t last long and hoped to find a familiar person for help or alliance. He understood that something terrible must have happened in the Reincarnation Realm.

“Luo Chen Senior!” Zhang Tiantian’s face lit up with joy at the sound of a shout in his ears.

“Luo Chen Senior!” Zhang Tiantian exclaimed, for the first time feeling so excited by Luo Tian’s voice.

“Buzz…” As Zhang Tiantian’s words ended, a resounding sword beam suddenly rose behind him.

The overwhelming pressure made Zhang Tiantian tremble. In an instant, the withered corpses following him were severed in half by that sword beam.

Two figures appeared before Zhang Tiantian’s eyes—Luo Tian and Suden.

Zhang Tiantian’s face lit up with joy, flying down to stand before Luo Tian and Suden. Seeing Suden, he felt no surprise; in Zhang Tiantian’s and most Reincarnation Sect disciples’ eyes, Luo Tian had already been entangled with Suden.

“Luo Chen Senior!” Zhang Tiantian, pale-faced, bowed respectfully to Luo Tian.

“What happened?” Luo Tian gazed at Zhang Tiantian’s pitiful state, a bad premonition rising in his heart.

“I don’t know… the disciples seem to have changed, becoming withered corpses. They attacked me without hesitation!” Zhang Tiantian quickly recovered his injuries while explaining to Luo Tian, inwardly sighing at his good fortune for meeting Luo Tian. If he hadn’t met him, he would have died here today.

Looking at the corpses, Zhang Tiantian instinctively shivered; he feared that after death, he might become like these corpses. That would be terrible.

“Their souls are missing!” Luo Tian approached the severed corpse, his gaze solemn.

“What? Their souls are missing?!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhang Tiantian and Suden’s faces changed drastically. They naturally knew what this meant.

“I always thought something would go wrong!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He had known from the moment he saw Yang Huanyu that this Reincarnation Realm wouldn’t be peaceful.

“After so many years, there’s still no change!” Luo Tian spoke softly, then turned to Suden and Zhang Tiantian.

“Our task now is to gather the Reincarnation Sect disciples, preventing them from being killed further. Once they die, they’ll become zombies!” Luo Tian instructed the two, his voice heavy with concern.

“Okay.” Suden nodded. This was the first time she had seen Luo Tian so solemn; even when facing the Eight Small Heavenly Kings, he hadn’t shown such a look. This enemy must be extremely powerful.

“But how do we find them? Someone killed these people so quickly, obviously knowing their cultivation spots.” Zhang Tiantian’s face bore helplessness.

“There must be a way! Do our best. With my and Suden’s strength, we should be able to defeat this person!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Who?” Suden’s eyes flashed with light, clearly knowing that Luo Tian had insight into this situation. He might even know who controlled these corpses.

“A old enemy. I saw him while cultivating on Mo Yang, but he didn’t recognize me. We’ve fought a few times before!”

“He’s terrifying. I was curious why he didn’t attack me before, but now it seems he had a plan—waiting for us to improve our cultivation in the Reincarnation Realm, then killing us. Perhaps he has a secret technique to absorb others’ cultivation and strengthen himself!” Luo Tian said.

“Absorbing others’ cultivation to strengthen oneself?!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Suden and Zhang Tiantian’s faces slightly changed.

“Set a trap!”

“We’ll wait here for him; he’ll eventually come to us!” Suden smiled lightly.

“But what about the others? He left us last, so might he kill them one by one?”

“If he kills everyone in the Reincarnation Realm, how terrifying his strength would become!” Zhang Tiantian’s eyes bore helplessness.

“Not only that, he can control these corpses. Thousands of True Immortal corpses could crush us to death!” Luo Tian sighed deeply.

“I have a way to make the Reincarnation Sect disciples find us!” Suden smiled, her eyes looking at Luo Tian with a touch of pride.

Zhang Tiantian saw Suden’s expression and was momentarily stunned; Suden was naturally attractive to men, her every smile and gesture captivating.

But Zhang Tiantian quickly regained his composure. Not only was it about status, but even if Luo Tian wasn’t here, he wouldn’t dare to have any thoughts.

“Buzz…” Suden moved her hands, waves of black qi emerging from them, transforming into thousands of butterflies that flew outward.

One batch after another of butterflies flew out from Suden’s hands, darkening the sky and spreading across the entire Reincarnation Realm from the Yin-Yang Tribes.

She released ten batches, and Suden’s face grew pale, clearly exhausted.

“Now just wait!” Suden smiled, leaning against Luo Tian’s chest and speaking to him.

Luo Tian didn’t object; after all, they had already done more intimate things.

“Wow!” Zhang Tiantian watched Luo Tian and Suden’s affectionate display, sighing bitterly. He felt a pang of jealousy but closed his eyes and sat on the ground to recover his cultivation.

Time passed slowly, ten days had gone by. Zhang Tiantian’s injuries were healed, but each day was painful; watching Suden tease Luo Tian and be affectionate with him was tormenting.

The Reincarnation Realm was vast, and the countless black butterflies flew quickly. After ten days, the entire Reincarnation Realm was filled with the presence of black butterflies.

These black butterflies sought out the Reincarnation Sect disciples, and upon finding one, they landed on their bodies. Suden’s seductive voice echoed in the disciples’ ears, urging them to follow the butterflies toward the Yin-Yang Tribes.

“What? Someone is hunting Reincarnation Sect disciples, and once they die, they’re truly dead!” The disciples were shocked. Some timid ones immediately rose and followed the butterflies toward the Yin-Yang Tribes.

Regardless of Suden’s status, they would follow her; especially with her seductive words that made them imagine.

Some disciples resisted, ignoring Suden’s words and remaining in their cultivation spots to enhance their strength.

“Did anyone notice?” Yang Huanyu opened his mouth, absorbing a True Immortal disciple’s cultivation into his body. He also grabbed a black butterfly in his hand.

After ten days, Yang Huanyu’s cultivation had risen dramatically; he was nearly at the late stage of True Immortality.

Behind him were hundreds of withered corpses, their bodies radiating coldness and fear.

“Is it the Yin-Yang Tribes? Well, once you all enter there, I’ll catch them all at once. But first, I’ll kill the fattest ones to reach the late stage of True Immortality more safely!” Yang Huanyu muttered, then controlled his army of corpses toward the next location. His memory held a genius nearby.

“What’s happening?” Wang Gang and other Small Heavenly Kings also received the butterflies from Suden, their faces showing concern. They knew if it weren’t urgent, Suden wouldn’t have informed them. Wang Gang and others immediately left their cultivation states and followed the butterflies toward the Yin-Yang Tribes.

The entire Reincarnation Realm stirred again, with only a few people remaining still. One of them was Wang Heng, one of the Eight Small Heavenly Kings.

At that moment, Wang Heng sat on a small hill, a long sword planted before him. A butterfly landed on his body.

“I’m about to break through to the late stage of True Immortality, mastering the third level of sword Dao. Suden, that dirty woman, is with Luo Chen—maybe it’s a trap. Wait until I complete my breakthrough and master the third level; if time allows, I’ll taste what that seductive woman is like!” Wang Heng’s face was scarred with sword marks, his teeth clenched in anger. He crushed the butterfly with his hand.

But just as Wang Heng was about to resume cultivation, a sky-shaking aura enveloped him, causing his face to pale. He suddenly stood up and looked down at the hill and sky.

Chapter 2159: Invitation to Battle ()

“Roar…” Hundreds of withered corpses filled the entire hill, surrounding Wang Heng and making his face pale.

“Suden’s words were true!” Wang Heng instantly recalled what Suden had said before.

But it was too late for regret; a black war spear fell from the sky, piercing toward Wang Heng. Meanwhile, those Reincarnation Sect disciples turned into withered corpses also rushed toward Wang Heng.

The sound of battle began, but Wang Heng had already cleared the area around him; no one knew he was being attacked.

At that moment, chaos erupted outside the Reincarnation Pool, everyone’s faces filled with shock as they watched those seated in meditation.

“Hundreds of people—only three hours have passed, and hundreds are dead! With nine hours left until the Reincarnation Pool ends, if this continues, they’ll all die before it’s over!” Yu Tian looked grim.

“I suggest we forcibly awaken Luo Chen. Even if he didn’t kill anyone, he must know what’s happening inside!” Yu Tian shouted loudly, his gaze on the vice-palace masters.

“F*** your dog!” Du Jianxing’s face was dark, his voice filled with anger.

“Yu Tian, I haven’t finished dealing with you yet. Now you’re causing trouble for my disciples? Do you think I won’t act against you?” Du Jianxing roared, his aura towering.

“Du Elder, I didn’t mean that. Haven’t you noticed something strange? This kid came to the Reincarnation Sect and kept causing trouble. Now over a thousand disciples are dead—these disciples aren’t weak, yet they died so easily?” Yu Tian trembled under Du Jianxing’s cold gaze.

“Which eye of yours saw Luo Chen kill them?”

“If you have evidence that Luo Chen killed them, then good. Today I’ll personally purge the sect. If not, stay quiet and don’t interfere!” Du Jianxing sneered.

“You…” Yu Tian was speechless, then looked at the other vice-palace masters.

“Du Elder, the signs clearly indicate it was Luo Chen. If this continues, besides the Eight Small Heavenly Kings who have a chance to escape under Luo Chen’s control, other disciples won’t have any chances!” The other vice-palace masters spoke.

“The Grand Master hasn’t said anything, so why are you in such a hurry? The Grand Master must know what to do!” Fu Xingxuan spoke.

“You little girl, don’t you understand? Go play in the mud, we’re talking and it’s not your turn to speak!” Yu Tian saw Fu Xingxuan bringing up the Grand Master again and finally shouted, giving no face to Fu Xingxuan.

“I am the Holy Maiden, and my status is equal to yours. Naturally, I have the right to participate. Moreover, I represent the Grand Master. What are you? Just because of your words, do you think the Grand Master will suppress me?” Fu Xingxuan’s face turned cold, her gaze on Yu Tian.

From the beginning, Yu Tian had targeted Luo Tian, which Fu Xingxuan couldn’t tolerate.

“Little girl, do you think you’re a green onion? When we followed the Grand Master, you were still suffering in hell. Do you dare to try me? The Grand Master won’t punish me!” Yu Tian couldn’t beat Du Jianxing, but he was quite confident against Fu Xingxuan.

“You can try!” Fu Xingxuan smiled coldly, raising her hand and summoning the Battle Platform. It flew out from her hands with a powerful surge.

“Do you think having the Battle Platform gives you the right to act recklessly? You’re not qualified!” Yu Tian’s face was cold, ignoring the Battle Platform.

“Wang Heng’s life force has disappeared!” At that moment, a shout made everyone turn their eyes back to the Reincarnation Pool.

“What happened? Wang Heng, even if he wasn’t Luo Chen’s match, he should have escaped from Luo Chen. Why did he die?” Several vice-palace masters, including Du Jianxing, had their faces change abruptly.

“The second Small Heavenly King! It’s been less than a month, and two have died!” Everyone’s faces showed disbelief.

“It must be Luo Chen; he had a grudge with Wang Heng. This time in the Reincarnation Pool, he killed Wang Heng!”

“This can’t be delayed any longer. If we continue to delay, the other Small Heavenly Kings might also be in danger!” Yu Tian shouted, his voice certain.

“You can try!” Du Jianxing stepped forward, his aura towering again. Fu Xingxuan’s face was also cold, standing by the Battle Platform and watching Yu Tian.

“If more than two thousand people die, I’ll personally bring Luo Chen out!” At that moment, the voices of Black and White Death God echoed in the sky.

Black and White Death God’s faces were also grim, but even they didn’t know what had happened in the Reincarnation Pool.

One was Duan BoYang, Black and White Death God could still suppress the Heavenly Ghost King. Another was Wang Heng; now they would have to deal with the Heavenly Ghost King and Yuan Ghost King together, which would be difficult for Black and White Death God.

“Since the Grand Master also suspects Luo Tian, what else is there to say?” Hearing Black and White Death God’s words, Yu Tian was excited.

“Two thousand people! This Reincarnation Pool only has over five thousand people, which is a huge loss for our sect!” People started discussing.

“If it’s not Luo Tian, I’ll show you today!” Du Jianxing spoke coldly, his gaze on Du Jianxing.

“You can! What if it’s Luo Tian? How will you deal with him, Du Elder?” Yu Tian’s eyes showed mockery as he looked at Du Jianxing.

“I’ll personally kill Luo Tian and then kneel before those disciples to apologize!”

“Of course, if it’s not my disciple Luo Tian who falsely accused my disciple, you should kneel and apologize to my disciple!” Du Jianxing shouted loudly, his face red, clearly angry at Yu Tian.

“Good! Du Elder, you’re the elder; we’ll take it as a deal!” Yu Tian nodded and looked at Du Jianxing.

In Yu Tian’s view, since the Grand Master also suspected Luo Tian, there was a 90% chance it was indeed Luo Tian.

With Black and White Death God’s words, people finally calmed down and focused on those who died in the Reincarnation Pool.

In the next hour, people were surprised to find that after Wang Heng’s death, few people died, unlike before.

While the Reincarnation Sect disciples observed their own disciples, a month had passed in the Reincarnation Realm.

A month later, at the central place of the Yin-Yang Tribes, a group of figures stood there with solemn faces.

The people of the Yin-Yang Tribes were shocked, looking at those figures in the center of their tribes. Each was very powerful, especially those standing on a small hill, who gave them pressure.

“Where did these people come from?” The tribes didn’t dare to leave their territory but discussed within their encampments.

On the hill, Luo Tian, Suden, Wang Gang, and Mo Tian sat there; their gazes turned to Luo Tian.

“Is it really that serious?” Wang Gang and others looked doubtful; they had only received the news but hadn’t seen Luo Tian’s mentioned Yang Huanyu. However, the withered corpses Luo Tian had shown them made them realize the situation was no simple.

“It’s very serious. This person has fought with me for a long time. If anyone in the entire Immortal Realm knows him best, it’s me. Although I don’t know how he entered the Reincarnation Realm, we should be careful. With so many people united, it shouldn’t be a problem.” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Luo Chen Senior, the disciples who came here are three thousand; nearly a thousand haven’t arrived. One of the Small Heavenly Kings, Wang Heng, hasn’t come!” Zhang Tian respectfully stood behind Luo Tian and spoke.

“Three thousand people should be enough. Those who didn’t come, we won’t care about their lives; we’ve already informed them. If they don’t listen, it’s not our fault!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Are we just waiting here? I say we should directly go and destroy him!” Mo Tian spoke, his voice filled with fire. He really wanted to see what kind of person could make Luo Tian so wary.

“Right, I also think we should strike first! Even if I don’t have confidence, I want to reduce the number of disciples who die in our sect!”

“We can also wait here, letting him come to us. But that would be too passive.” Luo Tian nodded, gazing at everyone.

“He has an army of withered corpses; it will be very noticeable. Finding him is easy! Suden, send a message through the butterflies to him, saying that we’ll fight in three days. He should come!” Luo Tian instructed Suden.

“Mo Cheng, now isn’t the time for modesty. I heard Suden say you excel at group battles and troop formations!” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed Mo Cheng.

“Three days is too short; ten days would be better. In ten days, he won’t kill many people. Maybe many places will be empty. Ten days would give us a brief adjustment!” Mo Cheng spoke softly.

“Good, then ten days!” Everyone agreed. Suden summoned butterflies and sent them outward, quickly finding Yang Huanyu.

“Ten days? I’ll see what you have!” Yang Huanyu smiled, his aura strong. He then walked toward the direction of the Yin-Yang Tribes in his memory.

“Boom…” Yang Huanyu’s back had over a thousand withered corpses, rigidly following him toward the Yin-Yang Tribes.

“Luo Senior, you’re the strongest; you and Wang Senior will hold the front line. Mo Senior, you’ll lead a group to hide in the shadows and come out when this person’s zombie army fully arrives!”

“I and Mo Senior will lead a group on the left wing, Qiu Long and Suden on the right. When he appears, I’ll surround him, connecting front and back with the Reincarnation Array to crush him!” Mo Cheng was also discussing how to deal with it with Luo Tian and others.

Chapter 2160: Battle ()

Ten days passed quietly, Luo Tian and others stood on the hill, gazing into the distance. Thunderous sounds echoed in the sky, cold air sweeping toward them.

“Roar…” Roars resounded; figures appeared in their vision—withered bodies, as if drained of life. Over a thousand corpses.

Yang Huanyu stood at the front of the corpse army, his face amused as he gazed at Luo Tian and others across the distance.

“Indeed, it’s him—Luo Family’s disciple of the Extreme Immortal Stage. I didn’t expect he had such influence in the Reincarnation Sect!” Yang Huanyu instantly recognized Luo Tian and others at the front.

“Indeed, there is such a person! He leads an army of corpses!”

“Over a thousand disciples—so many died!” Luo Tian’s people exclaimed, their eyes filled with disbelief. This was the first time they had seen an army of corpses, and they were shocked.

“Who are you?” Wang Gang roared, his gaze serious as he looked at Yang Huanyu. He felt a strong danger from Yang Huanyu, as if suppressed, his cultivation flowing slowly.

“Extreme Immortal!” Mo Tian’s eyes widened in shock, exclaiming and then looking at Luo Tian because he was also an Extreme Immortal.

“Who I am doesn’t matter; what matters is that you’ll all become my food today! After consuming your cultivation, I’ll reach the peak of True Immortality!” Yang Huanyu smiled, his Yamantao War Spear in hand.

“Kill!” Yang Huanyu said and pointed at Luo Tian’s group, and the corpses behind him roared, rushing toward Luo Tian.

Over a thousand corpses, though not covering the sky, were like a dark cloud sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Follow the plan!” Mo Cheng spoke and then flew up, with Suden, Mo Tian, Hong Tao, and others also rising, leading Reincarnation Sect disciples to their pre-arranged positions.

“Hold them back!” Luo Tian and Wang Gang exchanged glances, their backs having a thousand Reincarnation Sect disciples. Their task was to briefly hold back this army of corpses, allowing Mo Cheng’s group to fully surround Yang Huanyu and the thousand corpses, initiating the Reincarnation Array to capture them all.

Yang Huanyu was confident, rushing forward first and then the army of corpses roaring toward them.

“Kill…” Luo Tian unsheathed Longyuan and rushed toward Yang Huanyu. He knew the key was Yang Huanyu; if he killed him, the corpses would be no problem.

“I’ll see how strong this Extreme Immortal really is!” Wang Gang’s face showed boldness, a black long sword appearing in his hand. He slashed toward Yang Huanyu.

“Buzz…” The blade’s aura was about to strike Yang Huanyu when a shadow appeared before him, holding a long sword and colliding with the black blade.

“Wang Heng!” Recognizing the figure who blocked his blade, Wang Gang was shocked.

“Wang Heng has already died at his hands!” People’s eyes showed disbelief.

In an instant, Luo Tian and Wang Gang’s Reincarnation Sect disciples fought against the army of corpses.

“Buzz…” On another side, Luo Tian held Longyuan and rushed toward Yang Huanyu. Wang Heng rushed toward Wang Gang.

Red神芒 swept down, slashing toward Yang Huanyu. Yang Huanyu smiled and wielded his Yamantao War Spear, rushing toward the overwhelming sword aura.

“Crack…” The collision sound echoed; both Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu retreated simultaneously. Yang Huanyu’s eyes showed surprise, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Not bad, an Extreme Immortal indeed has some skills!” Yang Huanyu smiled and praised, then rushed forward with a surge of overwhelming power.

“Not just some skills; there are three, four!” Luo Tian smiled and danced his Longyuan sword, clashing with Yang Huanyu repeatedly.

The battle erupted instantly; Reincarnation Sect disciples continuously killed the corpses, but some of them also died at the hands of the corpses.

Though the corpses had no cultivation, their flesh was impossibly strong; thus, killing over a thousand corpses wasn’t achievable for a thousand disciples.

The scene was immediately tense; more Reincarnation Sect disciples died, and even worse, some who died were used by Yang Huanyu to become corpses attacking others.

“Done! So fast, over two hundred people have died!” Outside, it was chaos; people’s faces showed shock as they watched the Reincarnation Pool.

Due to different time flows, Luo Tian and others had died so many people here, but outside it was just an instant.

Two hundred people vanished without a trace, their life forces gone—this was shocking for people.

“Damn it! For so long no one died, but now so many!”

“Not only that, every moment someone dies!” People were completely shaken. At this rate, within an hour, the disciples in the Reincarnation Pool would be dead.

“One thousand two… one thousand two hundred and five…” The death count kept increasing; Yu Tian’s face was cold as he looked at Luo Tian seated in the Reincarnation Pool.

“Stop!” People kept counting the death numbers until it reached one thousand six, and then it stopped. The disciples’ death rate slowed again.

In the Reincarnation Realm, as time passed, Luo Tian and Wang Gang’s one thousand people, at a painful cost, finally held back the corpses. Suden and Mo Cheng’s group arrived, fully surrounding Yang Huanyu and the zombie army, relieving the pressure on Luo Tian’s Reincarnation Sect disciples.

“Deploy the Reincarnation Array!” Mo Cheng shouted, and the remaining two thousand Reincarnation Sect disciples radiated waves. They connected with each other, forming a yellow river. Each disciple disappeared, and the yellow river surrounded the corpses, rapidly moving to crush them.

“Roar…” A corpse roared and instinctively used its flesh to resist the Reincarnation Array. However, it was eventually crushed.

In an instant, over a hundred corpses were crushed by the array. Killing over a thousand corpses was just a matter of time.

Inside the array, Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu fought; Wang Gang also faced Wang Heng. Due to his deep understanding of Yang Huanyu, Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu were evenly matched. Wang Gang, however, had the upper hand and had already severed one of Wang Heng’s arms.

But around them were countless corpses, making it difficult for them. At this moment, only Luo Tian and Wang Gang hadn’t entered the array.

Luo Tian didn’t know how to use the Reincarnation Array, and Wang Gang couldn’t either. Wang Heng was very tough.

“Is this what you prepared?” Yang Huanyu collided with Luo Tian, retreated, and gazed at the Reincarnation Array that crushed corpses.

“Yes!” Luo Tian waved his hands, and a hellish claw tore through the sky toward Yang Huanyu.

“Yin Army Invokes!” Yang Huanyu waved his hands, sending out waves. A black figure instantly formed, radiating the aura of a middle-stage True Immortal. The black figure flew up and rushed toward the tearing hellish claw.

“Ten… one hundred… one thousand…” In an instant, a thousand figures appeared like illusions under the sky. Ten were middle-stage True Immortals; the rest were early-stage.

“Again this trick!” Luo Tian’s eyes slightly narrowed. Yang Huanyu had summoned ten yin soldiers before; this time it was a thousand.

“Merge!” Yang Huanyu smiled and pressed his hand into the void, causing the sky-filled yin soldiers to descend toward the corpses. In Luo Tian’s shock, they fused with the corpses.

Boom… Boom…

The sound of explosions echoed; each corpse’s aura surged, their eyes glowing with black light. Their strength had improved significantly.

Not only that, each corpse now held a black spear in their hands, rushing toward the flowing Reincarnation Array.

With over a thousand yin soldiers and corpses merged, their overall strength surpassed the Reincarnation Sect disciples.

All the corpses converged into one giant spear, rushing toward the Reincarnation Array.

“Hold on!” Mo Cheng and others shouted, feeling if the array was broken, the remaining Reincarnation Sect disciples would be no match for these merged yin soldiers and corpses.
