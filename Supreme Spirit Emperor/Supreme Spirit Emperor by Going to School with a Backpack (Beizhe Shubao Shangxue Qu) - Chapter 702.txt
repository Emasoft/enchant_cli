“Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong. Now this matter is too chaotic; I've already activated the methods left by my ancestors, and marked Luotian. There will be no mistakes!” Su Peng spoke, gazing at the three of them—Luotian and his family—with a look of relief.

“Enough. Help this boy rest!” Xiang Tianming spoke, observing Luotian's pale face and knowing he must have suffered a severe spiritual wound.

With Su Luo supporting him, Luotian returned to his room and sat cross-legged, closing his eyes.

At that moment, the chaos in Luotian's spiritual sea was overwhelming. It teemed with spiritual energy—his own and that of the Six-Armed Divine Emperor.

"Though wounded, if I fully absorb this spiritual energy into my soul, it won't just recover—it might even advance further!" Luotian murmured internally, gazing at his gray soul.

Yet he didn't intend to fully refine it. Time was limited, and there wasn't much left for Su Dan. He didn't want to waste too long on himself.

Closing his eyes, Luotian began absorbing the surging spiritual energy to restore his soul.

Time passed slowly. Luotian had long mastered this process, so the recovery was swift. Within a day, his soul recovered to half its strength.

After just one day of recovery, Luotian rose from the room. He extended his hand to set up a barrier and ordered Chen Zhanbiao and Diaodezhu to guard the entrance. No one else was allowed in—except Xiang Tianming, Su Luo, Su Peng, and the alchemists.

Boom...

A massive gray cauldron appeared before Luotian—the Xu Tian Ding. The heavy cauldron radiated an ancient aura as Luotian raised his hand, and a series of medicinal herbs flew from his palm into the cauldron.

Each herb was thrown into Xu Tian Ding, causing the alchemists to become increasingly excited.

"Watching Master Luotian refine pills is a true pleasure. Just his technique alone, we could never master it!" one alchemist sighed, eyes fixed on Luotian.

"But Master Luotian isn't refining the pills from his notes. I don’t recognize these herbs!" another alchemist spoke, eyes filled with confusion.

Because of the barrier, Luotian couldn't hear their conversation. If he had, he would have nodded—because indeed, he wasn’t refining the pills he'd planned.

Soul-Subduing Pill, a seven-star divine elixir. This was an idea Luotian had suddenly come up with, due to the remaining spiritual energy in his mind. He decided to refine a batch of pills that could strengthen souls.

Soul was the root of all things. If one's soul wasn't stable, everything else was pointless. Luotian wanted to first strengthen Su Dan’s soul before refining the pills he had previously planned.

A solemn expression appeared on Luotian's face. He hadn't refined pills in a long time, and his hands felt stiff. Moreover, spiritual energy was limited—each use reduced it further. Other herbs were manageable.

As he spoke, ten-color flames surged out, rushing into the fire mouth to begin refining over a hundred herbs.

After an hour, one hundred elixirs floated within Xu Tian Ding. Sweat dripped from Luotian's forehead as he stared intently at the cauldron, his eyes glowing with intense light. The Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye also activated.

"This is the most important part!" Luotian murmured internally, beginning to channel spiritual energy from his mind. A thread of spiritual power drifted from Luotian's body and merged into Xu Tian Ding.

Sss...

A wave of pain shot through Luotian's body, as if ten-color flames were burning his soul.

"Ten Thousand Ghosts Sealing!" Luotian roared, controlling the spiritual energy to transform into a gray hand. It formed a seal and pressed down onto one elixir.

Buzz...

The gray seal merged with the elixir. Luotian didn't dare to be careless, for this was just the beginning.

"Again!" Luotian roared and sent another seal into an elixir.

"One... ten..."

Time passed slowly. Luotian continuously infused spiritual energy seals, but he inevitably became distracted, making mistakes that caused the seals to collapse. He had to reassemble them.

After half a day, Luotian finally managed to infuse the one hundred and eight spiritual energy seals into the one hundred and eight elixirs.

Within Xu Tian Ding, powerful energy constantly surged. These one hundred and eight elixirs had consumed two-thirds of Luotian's remaining spiritual energy. This batch of pills must succeed—unless he made no mistakes next time.

"Condense!" Luotian roared, beginning to gather the one hundred and eight elixirs.

The elixirs collided with each other, and Luotian felt his head throb painfully, as if thunderclaps exploded in his mind.

"Little Seven, refine it!" Luotian roared. Though painful, he didn't dare to relax. He forced himself to channel flames into Xu Tian Ding, merging the elixirs.

Chapter 2635: Soul-Union Elixir

Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sounds kept echoing. Each sound caused Luotian's body to tremble slightly, making Su Peng and Su Luo feel terrified.

"Does refining pills really require this suffering?" Su Peng and Su Luo wondered, unable to understand why Luotian did this.

"Master Luotian's elixir must be high-grade. But refining pills does cause injury, sometimes even risking one’s life!" said the five-star alchemist.

"Will my father be in danger?" Su Luo's eyes showed worry. He had only just reunited with Luotian.

"Of course there’s danger, but Master Luotian is experienced. He should be fine!" The alchemists looked with reverence, sensing that Luotian's elixir was definitely no ordinary one. The process had made a seven-star alchemist suffer so much, meaning the elixir's grade was definitely not low.

Buzz...

As they spoke, a dark cloud drifted from the sky. A heavy pressure made everyone's faces change slightly.

"They've come! They’ve arrived! The elixir’s about to be done!" Five alchemists said excitedly, gazing at Luotian. Su Peng and Su Luo also stared intently at him.

In contrast, Chen Zhanbiao, Diaodezhu, and Ren Hongzhe seemed relaxed. They didn’t care at all, just watching around to see if anyone approached.

Luotian smiled, gazing at Xu Tian Ding. His eyes glowed with golden light as he saw the scene inside the cauldron.

Inside Xu Tian Ding, a gray elixir floated above ten-color flames. Luotian no longer felt pain.

"It went smoothly!"

"It can withstand Little Seven’s flames. This Soul-Union Elixir will definitely elevate Su Dan's soul to a powerful level!" Luotian murmured internally, sensing the timing was right. He slapped his hand.

The cauldron’s lid lifted. A gray streak of light shot out instantly, and as the elixir appeared, a golden thunderclap descended from the sky. The city lord's mansion’s people felt terrified.

The gray elixir radiated a pressure, an oppressive force from the soul. Even the barrier couldn’t block it.

Royal Sovereign Qi!

Everyone gasped, staring at the gray elixir. Especially Su Peng and Xiang Tianming felt a power beyond an imperial king.

"Why do I feel like kneeling?" Su Luo and the five alchemists showed shock, their hearts suddenly wanting to kneel.

"Stay steady!" Su Peng spoke softly, then pointed his finger at the ground. A great momentum rose and fell on Su Luo and the five alchemists, relieving them of pressure.

Boom...

As everyone was shocked, the gray elixir collided with the golden thunderclap. The formidable lightning shattered instantly, as if it had insulted the elixir.

"Too powerful! The thunderclap couldn’t even move it!"

"It’s because of that thread of royal sovereign qi. A sovereign is someone even the heavenly laws fear!" Su Peng spoke, eyes filled with shock.

Jiu Gui Wang’s ancestor had once been a divine emperor. Thus, Su Peng knew something about the royal sovereign. Jiu Gui Wang suspected that ancient times’ sovereigns' deaths contained great secrets.

Boom... Boom...

Several thunderbolts streaked across the sky, but they all shattered before the gray elixir. After eight thunderbolts, the elixir fell into Luotian’s hands.

"It's an eighth-grade elixir!" The five alchemists' eyes were filled with excitement. They hadn’t expected Luotian to be an eighth-grade divine alchemist.

"Little wonder he could easily make fifth-grade elixirs!" They gasped, watching Luotian standing there.

"Is it because of the Six-Armed Divine Emperor’s spiritual energy that this elixir advanced to eighth-grade?" Luotian murmured, also not expecting the elixir to be eighth-grade.

"Still, if I used only my spiritual energy, it would have been seventh-grade!" Luotian sealed the elixir and handed it to Su Peng.

"Uncle, take this. I'll refine another batch for Su Dan to take!" Luotian spoke. He needed to adjust his state again.

"Good." Su Peng solemnly took the elixir. He saw hope, the chance for Su Dan to live.

"There's still two and a half days!" Luotian murmured. Time was too tight. The next elixir was the most important one—this Soul-Union Elixir was just an extra.

Luotian returned to his room, adjusting his state. Refining the Soul-Union Elixir had consumed much of his spiritual energy and he needed to recover.

Fortunately, there was still some spiritual energy left in his mind, allowing him to recover quickly. Otherwise, he would have had no choice but to push through.

The next day, Luotian slowly opened his eyes. His spiritual energy was completely gone, fully merged into him. His soul had recovered to half its strength.

"Though only half, my soul has grown stronger this time. Once I recover, it can advance to the late imperial king level!" Luotian murmured internally and slowly stood up.

"Soul-Union Elixir!" Luotian clenched his fists, stepping out of the room and approaching Xu Tian Ding.

Luotian had been thinking for days. He only found one way to solve Su Dan’s condition: sharing his life with her, establishing a connection so they could share the burden.

Thus, he named this elixir Soul-Union Elixir. If they both couldn’t withstand it, the end would be mutual death.

Su Peng and others reappeared. Knowing this was important, they stayed outside the barrier without making a sound.

Luotian focused his mind. This time he was extremely cautious, not wanting any mistakes. He wanted it to succeed on the first try.

He didn’t care about the elixir’s grade. He just wanted it to save Su Dan's life, even if it meant sacrificing his own.

After a quarter of an hour, over two hundred herbs were placed into Xu Tian Ding. The five alchemists outside gasped but were silenced by Su Peng's glare.

The familiar scene: ten-color flames surged into Xu Tian Ding, splitting into over two hundred parts to burn the herbs.

"Two herbs, Master Luotian placed two!" One alchemist spoke, eyes filled with confusion. But before he could finish, Su Peng's fiery gaze fell on him.

"Is it two elixirs being refined?" The alchemists wondered, but dared not speak again. Two hours passed, and Luotian's entire focus was on the two hundred elixirs in Xu Tian Ding.

Chapter 2636: Taking the Elixir

"Condense!" Luotian roared, extending his hand. Two drops of blood flew from it and into Xu Tian Ding.

The two drops of blood were wrapped by over a hundred elixirs, then covered and continuously refined.

The long refinement process left Luotian with no relaxation. His forehead was drenched in sweat.

Another two hours passed, and Luotian finally roared. He slapped his hand, evolving a series of demonic patterns from it. They flew into the cauldron and covered the two elixirs.

Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sounds kept echoing. As demonic patterns entered, the two elixirs began to move rapidly within the cauldron, emitting a series of explosions.

The two elixirs seemed like yin and yang—mutually opposing yet connected by the blood of Luotian.

The sky churned, and a storm cloud descended. Multicolored lightning danced within it. The heavy atmosphere made the city lord's mansion people feel terrified.

"Again!" The five alchemists and Su Peng, Luosu were excited. They knew that if they survived this thunderclap, Luotian would succeed—Su Dan had a chance.

Boom...

The cauldron's lid opened. A torrential energy surged out, forming a black storm that rushed toward the thundercloud.

Crack... Crack...

As the storm burst out, a series of lightning bolts descended from the thundercloud, striking the black storm.

"Eight! And they all came at once!" The alchemists gasped. Before they could finish, a big hand smashed them away.

"You speak again, I'll strangle you!" Su Peng glared at them angrily. He felt they were causing trouble.

"Lord City Lord..."

"Now the elixir is out, Master Luotian doesn't mind being disturbed!" The alchemists looked委屈, gazing at Su Peng.

"Ah..." Su Peng's face turned red with embarrassment. He looked away from Luotian.

The storm and lightning collided, the sky thundering. A black vortex appeared. The eight lightning bolts were gradually worn down by the storm.

"Another eighth-grade elixir! I've never seen eight thunderclaps descend at once!" One alchemist said, eyes filled with admiration.

Finally, in everyone's sight, the eight lightning bolts disappeared. Only a sky-piercing black storm remained.

"What is this elixir? It hasn't stopped yet!" The alchemists watched the sky-piercing storm, eyes filled with excitement.

"Stop it!" Luotian looked at the storm that didn't calm down. He flew up, opening a domain to collide with it.

The collision caused several cracks in Luotian's domain. His eyes were about to shatter.

"Unwilling?" Luotian murmured internally, raising his hand. A black vortex appeared, and black claws grabbed the storm.

The thunderous sound shook all around. Under the Hellish Demon Claws, the sky-piercing storm was finally scattered. Luotian extended his hands and took out two elixirs.

Two black elixirs trembled violently in Luotian's hands, trying to escape. They seemed to repel each other.

Luotian sealed the two elixirs, a smile on his face. No matter what, he had finally refined them. And it looked like they were high-grade eighth-grade elixirs.

"Uncle, take care of them. Tomorrow I'll personally give Su Dan the elixir!" Luotian handed the elixirs to Su Peng.

"Good, good." Su Peng solemnly took them. He didn't understand much; everything relied on Luotian.

Luotian returned to his room, adjusting his state again. Tomorrow he would take the Soul-Union Elixir, and he didn't know what consequences it might bring.

A day passed quietly. The next day, Luotian stood up and opened the door, heading to Su Dan's courtyard. He saw Su Peng and Luosu waiting there early.

"Uncle, Su'er, you two stay here!" Luotian took the elixir from Su Peng's hand and entered the room. He sent out waves, isolating the entire room.

Luotian approached Su Dan's bed. She was still sleeping, her face youthful but with many white hairs in her black hair—clearly, Su Dan's condition and functions had deteriorated further.

Luotian didn't disturb the sleeping Su Dan. He silently watched her, his gaze filled with tenderness.

After an hour, Su Dan slowly awoke. She saw Luotian sitting there with a gentle face.

"You came? When did you arrive?" Su Dan spoke weakly. She could feel she had little time left, no tomorrow.

"just arrived!" Luotian helped Su Dan sit up and used his other hand to take out the Soul-Union Elixir.

"Take it. It's good for you!" Luotian placed the elixir into Su Dan's mouth.

At the same time, Luotian moved his hands over Su Dan. Her body was too weak; he needed to slowly catalyze the medicine's power, allowing Su Dan to gradually improve.

Spiritual energy naturally wandered through Su Dan’s body, gathering into her weak soul.

The soul, corroded by an unknown force, strengthened continuously under the Soul-Union Elixir. Su Dan's face showed disbelief, forgetting Luotian’s hands constantly moving.

Su Dan clearly felt her soul's change. If before it was a baby, now it was a teenager growing rapidly.

After three hours, Luotian fully integrated the Soul-Union Elixir's power into Su Dan. Her face improved significantly, though her body was weak. Luotian could feel her soul's strength, matching his own.

Both were drenched in sweat. If someone saw it, they would misunderstand—sweat soaked Su Dan's clothes. Only now did Luotian notice Su Dan’s delicate figure.

"I can live for a while longer. Want to see it? Want to watch me die!" Su Dan regained some strength and returned to her personality. She shook her clothes, making Luotian's nose heat up.

Chapter 2637: Connection

"Don't play. I won't let you die!" Luotian spoke quickly, watching Su Dan's appearance and forcing himself to suppress his impulses. He sat cross-legged, face red, adjusting.

After an hour of adjustment, Luotian stood up and approached Su Dan. He took out two elixirs—one placed into Su Dan's mouth, the other directly into his own.

After taking the elixirs, Luotian helped Su Dan refine them. The elixir in his body quickly digested, a formless wave wandering through his body.

After an hour, Su Dan's elixir was refined completely. Both their bodies trembled violently.

Luotian held Su Dan's hand, and they could clearly feel a wave in their bodies moving toward each other.

But just as it was about to connect, it stopped. Luotian's face turned grim.

"Why is this happening? There shouldn't be a problem!" Luotian roared internally. His calculations were perfect, but in the end, it was just one step short. If they had connected, he could have shared the burden.

"But there's no problem!" Su Dan smiled, seeing Luotian’s pale face. She knew he had failed.

Su Dan didn't care. In her view, seeing Luotian for the last time and watching him work so hard for her was enough.

"Something's wrong. It definitely isn't the elixir!" Luotian frowned, tightly gripping his hands, thinking constantly.

"Don’t overthink it!" Su Dan lightly leaned on Luotian's chest, smiling.

"I'm sorry. I did my best but still couldn't stop it." Luotian's eyes showed sorrow. He knew Su Dan was externally strong but internally weak. The elixir he had given her was too powerful for her body to bear.

"Since I'm in good condition now, take me. This time I am Su Dan!" Su Dan flipped over and lay on top of Luotian, gazing at him with affection. Her red lips pressed against his.

"Impossible! I won't let you die!" Luotian tried to push Su Dan away but dared not use force. Finally, he couldn't resist Su Dan's passion.

The scene was endless. Su Dan was at her most alluring, and waves of energy spread from the room.

Outside the courtyard, Su Peng and Luosu stood there. They felt waves of energy coming out, eyes filled with tension.

"Grandpa, do you think your father and mother will succeed?" Luosu asked. They had been waiting there for half a day.

"I don't know. It's quite difficult." Su Peng sighed deeply. He knew the taboo techniques of their lineage were powerful and the consequences were terrifying.

They waited anxiously. After an hour, a loud shout echoed through the barrier to Su Peng and Luosu's ears.

"Huh?" Luosu showed confusion, feeling the voice was strange.

"Kid, go. Grandpa's tired!" Su Peng frowned slightly but smiled, pulling the confused Luotian away.

Inside the room, Luotian and Su Dan had already dressed. They had finished, but after finishing, Luotian suddenly noticed the wave had connected. He gradually felt pain.

"Ah..." The shout echoed, Luotian groaned in pain. Su Dan also shouted but clearly their voices were filled with excitement because Luotian felt Su Dan's power gradually moving into his body.

At this moment, it was the climax. Luotian also felt Su Dan's pain. If not for their connection, Su Dan would have likely died.

It was their shouts that made Su Peng misunderstand. He thought Luotian had succeeded, and they were too passionate to control themselves, so he led Luosu away.

"Who knows if this time will give Luosu a little brother?" Su Peng smiled, his face full of wrinkles.

"Grandpa, why are you smiling?" Luosu asked, watching Su Peng's smile.

"It's nothing. You're still young!" Su Peng shook his head, but his face turned serious when he saw Luosu had grown tall.

"Thirteen is already quite old!" Su Peng's eyes shone with light, making Luosu's hair stand on end.

Half an hour later, Luotian and Su Dan sat there drenched in sweat. Their appearances weren't good, but Luotian's eyes were filled with joy.

Now they had an inexplicable connection. Luotian gazed at Su Dan, sighing inwardly. She had suffered so much over the years. He had personally experienced her pain, and even with his willpower, it was difficult.

"Thank you!" Su Dan smiled. She could also feel Luotian had given her a lot—life, cultivation, and energy. They were now almost the same; Luotian had given her his share.

Fortunately, they both made it through. Although Luotian's strength and lifespan had lost some, he didn't care. Compared to Su Dan, those were worthless.

"Surely not a little brother!" Su Dan flirted with her finger across Luotian's chest, face still flushed. She teased Luotian again.

"Now I don't fear you!" Luotian looked at Su Dan's appearance and couldn’t resist. He pressed her down with both hands.

"You, still coming?"

"Of course. Twin Cultivation helps us recover!" The scene was endless until darkness fell, and Luotian finally stepped out of Su Dan's room.

It was more like being kicked out. Luotian's face showed embarrassment, feeling his position was truly low.

"Ah..."

"It seems I need to teach these wives a lesson!" Luotian sighed internally, stepping out of the courtyard and dispersing the barrier. His face became serious again, then sent a mental message to Su Peng, Diaodezhu, and others.

Almost as soon as Luotian returned to his courtyard, Su Peng, Luosu, and Diaodezhu stood in the courtyard.

"Success!" Luotian spoke to them. However, they remained calm and showed no surprise.

"I said it was successful!" Luotian spoke again. He thought after saying this, Su Peng and Luosu would be excited.

"Yes, I know. Tell me what to do next. The Luo Shengmen issue can't be delayed anymore!" Diaodezhu spoke to Luotian.

Chapter 2638: Clearing Out

"Uh..." Luotian looked at the calm faces of the others, feeling uncomfortable. But upon hearing Diaodezhu's words, his face slightly straightened.

"Luo Shengmen?" Luotian’s eyes flashed with coldness. Luo Shengmen was strong, but he wasn’t easy to provoke. He had a big grudge with Luo Shengmen. Perhaps even the entire Tianyuan Sect couldn’t eliminate Luo Shengmen, but Luotian would at least knock out two of their teeth to make them feel pain.

"Can you still find that person's aura?" Luotian looked at Diaodezhu and asked.

"I can. One of the five in Tianhu Mountain was one, but I didn’t point it out at that time!" Diaodezhu replied.

"Good. When I fully recover, we’ll meet Luo Shengmen!" Luotian smiled lightly. His current state wasn’t good; he needed to recover.

"Ten Palaces have ordered that no hellish forces will help you. But if you’re in trouble, come to my Jiu Gui Wang City. Even the Ten Palaces' Yama King would fear it!" Su Peng spoke, calming Luotian’s mind. At least in Jiu Gui Wang City, he was safe.

"Hope we don’t have to go that far!" Luotian murmured internally. Though he wanted to know what the ancient Jiu Gui Wang had left for his descendants, if it came to that, it might bring trouble to Jiu Gui Wang City.

After discussing for a while, Diaodezhu and others left. However, Luotian kept Luosu.

"Su'er, I saved your mother. Are you not happy?" Luotian’s face showed confusion as he looked at Luosu.

Now, because he had given half his life to Su Dan, Luotian looked like a middle-aged man. Thus, he and Luosu stood together, clearly father and son.

"Of course I'm excited. But Uncle Diaodezhu said your attack would definitely succeed. Grandpa also knew you would succeed, so I didn’t get too excited."

"Uh..." Luotian was stunned. He had done something remarkable, but they showed no reaction at all.

"Good. Rest well. These days, I'll guide you. You seem to like refining elixirs!" Luotian looked at Luosu, eyes filled with tenderness. In the celestial realm, he truly had only one son; he needed to educate him well.

"I wonder how Liang'er and the others are doing!" Luotian murmured internally. According to time, the Nine Realms had passed millions of years.

Luotian felt anxious. If he stayed in the celestial realm for hundreds more years, many people in the Nine Realms would be gone.

He didn’t worry about the younger generation. Luotian worried about Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian, as the younger generation had already been sealed by him.

"Regardless, I must return to the Nine Realms once more. Now that I'm at the middle imperial king level, I can tear through space to enter the star realm. However, I still don’t know where the Nine Realms are located!" Luotian’s eyes showed determination.

"Good." Luosu's eyes also showed excitement. He was only thirteen, and he longed to live with Luotian.

The next day, Diaodezhu, Xiang Tianming, and Chen Zhanbiao flew out of Jiu Gui Wang City. Luotian stayed in Jiu Gui Wang City to rest.

With Su Dan and Luosu's family, they spent a rare time together. Su Dan had recovered well. The three of them wandered around Jiu Gui Wang City, and Luotian occasionally guided Luosu's cultivation and elixirs.

To Luotian’s surprise, Luosu had some talent in refining elixirs. He could already produce flames after learning for just two days.

Most importantly, Luosu's attitude was remarkable. The Thousand-Page Oil-Soaked Hands technique was extremely painful, requiring one to insert their hands into hot oil. Luosu showed no complaints and practiced daily.

As for martial arts, Luotian didn’t teach them. Since Luosu was only at the late heavenly sage level, the techniques he used were too demanding for him. Luotian had prepared jade slips and placed them with Su Dan.

Time passed slowly. Seven days had gone by, and Luotian finally recovered after his self-adjustment.

The four who had left returned, looking slightly tired. Only Xiang Tianming looked normal.

"They destroyed two Luo Shengmen outposts. They met strong resistance, killing two imperial kings at the early stage and escaping three, one of whom was an imperial king at the late stage!"

"But I’ve recorded their auras. They split into three directions and escaped!" Diaodezhu spoke to Luotian. The four of them had been clearing out Luo Shengmen's people for several days.

"Okay. We'll take them one by one. As long as these three don’t die, we can keep searching endlessly. Eventually, we’ll find Qiu Chan!" Luotian spoke softly.

Diaodezhu and the others rested for a day. Then, Luotian and the others flew out of Jiu Gui Wang City to find Luo Shengmen's people based on Diaodezhu’s sense.

One... Two...

Each outpost was eliminated by the five of them. The five felt shocked at Luo Shengmen's strength. It had been only a few years since they emerged, yet it had such power and was hidden in the shadows. Even the Ten Palaces of Yama hadn’t caught them.

Of course, this was also because the Ten Palaces of Yama didn't take Luo Shengmen seriously. However, in three months, the five had eliminated six outposts of Luo Shengmen. Each outpost had tens of thousands and strong imperial kings.

But eliminating these outposts also caught Luo Shengmen's attention. After that, the next three to four months, it took the five a month to find one outpost. Moreover, the two who had escaped from Diaodezhu's scent disappeared, leaving only one imperial king at the late stage.

In a dark hall, green flames flickered around. Black figures stood there, all hiding their faces and radiating coldness.

On a tall altar, a black chair held a young man. He smiled.

Beside him stood eight figures, their sleeves embroidered with the moon, like eight sculptures standing there.

At the altar's base, two heads lay on the ground. Blood still flowed from them, eyes filled with despair.

"Because of them, we lost tens of thousands. Should they be killed?" The young man spoke softly, eyes smiling as he gazed at the people below the altar. But his smile was chilling.

"Kill them!" A chorus of roars echoed from below the altar. These people's eyes were filled with fanaticism.

"Luotian? Since you've come to die, don't blame me. I hadn’t planned to attack you first. The timing wasn’t right!" The young man smiled and spoke to the eight figures beside him.

"See if they come. If they do, we’ll destroy them on the spot!" The young man spoke softly, gazing at the trembling old man below the altar. This was the imperial king at the late stage that Diaodezhu had known.

"Still, it's most important to deal with the Ten Palaces of Yama. Though they said they handed over the task of exterminating us to Tianyuan Sect, it's hard to say they won't secretly act!" The young man spoke again, his eyes filled with seriousness.

Chapter 2639: Coercion

Under the black sky, Luotian and the others flew. After months of pursuit, the five had flown beyond Jiu Gui Wang City's range.

"Stop!" While flying, Luotian suddenly made the others stop. His brows slightly furrowed.

"What's wrong? We're almost there!" Diaodezhu looked confused. They had been searching for the one imperial king at the late stage for days, and now there was less than a day left.

"We've destroyed so many outposts. We must have caught Luo Shengmen's attention. The two imperial kings at the early stage had their scents disappear, leaving only this one at the late stage. There must be something strange here!" Luotian spoke softly. He didn’t want to clash with Luo Shengmen directly, just wanted to find Qiu Chan and bring her back.

"It makes sense. Maybe there's a trap!" Xiang Tianming replied. They were all battle-hardened veterans. After Luotian spoke, they nodded in agreement.

"What now? Return?" Diaodezhu asked. They had been out for three months and were indeed tired.

"I have another lead. Let's see if they're together. If they are, we'll rest in Jiu Gui Wang City for a month and then find this imperial king at the late stage!" Luotian spoke, extending his hand. A thread of gray mist flew from it.
