Meng Lingyun was even more agonized, his feet emitting thick wisps of mist—clearly scorched by the terrifying ghost flame. After all, his feet had originally been formed from the Immortal Marvel Tree, and thus were subject to mutual generation and destruction.

"Break it!" Luo Tian continuously punched, his indomitable flesh body enduring the terrifying flames, yet achieving little effect.

"Fire!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He formulated a bold plan in his mind, and before long, he acted upon it.

"Come here!" Luo Tian shouted, opening his mouth to suck in a vast amount of ashen flames.

"Buzz..." The blistering heat instantly ignited Luo Tian's physical body, yet it did not harm his flesh. The most terrifying aspect was that the soul within Luo Tian's body, which had been infused with the blood of the蛮族首领 (Barbarian Clan Leader), began to burn fiercely alongside the ashen flames.

"Go!" Luo Tian growled, his formidable spiritual awareness enduring unbearable torment. He directed the ashen flames into Meng Haoyan's elixir field.

It seemed he had prepared for this. As the ashen flames surged into Meng Haoyan's elixir field, Luo Tian's soul—still burning the blood of the Barbarian Clan Leader on the golden small sword—instantly withdrew.

If souls could sweat, Luo Tian would have been drenched in perspiration. Within a brief moment, one-third of his soul had been burned away.

"Die!" Ming Haoyan's face twisted with mockery upon witnessing Luo Tian's actions. This was his ultimate technique, a flame fueled by Meng Lingyun's leg, yet Luo Tian had drawn it into Meng Haoyan's body.

"Perfect. I've received a reincarnation body of the Epoch's peak—its success rate must be higher!" Ming Haoyan's eyes gleamed with a hint of amusement, awaiting Luo Tian's soul to be scorched.

Meanwhile, Meng Lingyun was drenched in sweat, desperately suppressing the flame that could burn everything. Yet his efforts were futile; his feet had been reduced to ash, and the fire spread throughout his body.

"Buzz..." A resonant hum echoed. When Ming Haoyan believed Luo Tian was doomed, a sudden sound arose from Meng Haoyan's elixir field.

"It succeeded!" Luo Tian's heart surged with excitement. The small sword hovering in Meng Haoyan's elixir field radiated brilliant light, and the withered blood of the Barbarian Clan Leader was completely incinerated by the ashen flames.

"I'll see how you claim this body!" Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, golden sword qi flashing from Meng Haoyan's eyes.

"Impossible! How terrifying this reincarnation body must be, that even the ghost flame cannot destroy it!" Ming Haoyan was stunned, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Even Meng Lingyun was awestruck. As an Epoch Master, he knew the ashen flames' terror well—his feet made of the Immortal Marvel Tree had vanished, proving it. Yet Luo Tian had drawn the ashen flames into his body and remained unscathed.

Sword qi spread everywhere. As people marveled, golden light erupted from Luo Tian's mouth. A small golden sword slowly flew out of his mouth, hovering above his head.

"This blade was crafted by an Epoch Master—it rivals an Epoch Treasure!" Meng Lingyun spoke, his voice brimming with joy. He felt the blade's sharpness and was moved.

Sword qi shook the heavens, golden sword energy surged around Luo Tian. Like a fish breaking free from a net, it darted through the void before returning to Meng Haoyan's body, emitting a mournful hum.

"Disjointed Soul Sword!" Luo Tian realized the small sword's name as it broke free, a smile crossing his face.

"Buzz..." The next moment, the golden sword suddenly expanded into a seven-foot blade. Luo Tian stood beside Meng Haoyan.

He activated Meng Haoyan's body, grasping the Disjointed Soul Sword and murmuring, "Apologies—I am not your true master."

"Buzz..." Luo Tian waved his hand, a torrent of fierce sword qi erupted from the Disjointed Soul Sword, sweeping outward.

"Crash..." The ashen flames, upon encountering the sword qi, instantly scattered like they had met an enemy. Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun regained their freedom.

"Damn it!" Ming Haoyan's face darkened, no longer composed. His expression bore deep apprehension as he gazed at Luo Tian and the golden Disjointed Soul Sword. He felt a profound sense of danger from both.

As the Disjointed Soul Sword exited Meng Haoyan's elixir field, Luo Tian's soul perfectly merged with Meng Haoyan's body. Thus, he appeared even more complete—like a rebirth of Meng Haoyan.

"Rest assured. I won't disgrace your master. Join me in guarding the peace of the Nine Realms!" Luo Tian roared, like a reborn war god. He brandished the Disjointed Soul Sword and charged at Ming Haoyan.

"Kill!" Meng Lingyun's feet reappeared, entering the body of Junlin Tian. He wielded a sword of destruction alongside Luo Tian, clashing with Ming Haoyan once more.

The thunderous clashes continued. Luo Tian felt his power was extraordinary, each strike fierce and overwhelming, forcing Ming Haoyan to struggle. Meng Lingyun's every strike left severe wounds on Ming Haoyan.

"Roar!" Ming Haoyan shouted, his voice filled with rage. At this point, there was no retreat—only to slay Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun could he complete his unfinished plan.

The life-and-death battle resumed, but now Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun held the upper hand. Ming Haoyan was pushed back relentlessly.

Three combatants clashed repeatedly, each collision sending tremors through the heavens. They fought so fiercely they forgot time and space.

"Success is essential!" Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian, the sole witnesses of this epic battle, prayed fervently. They knew the true outcome was about to be revealed.

Would Luo Tian, who had possessed Meng Haoyan's body, and Meng Lingyun, once an Epoch Master, slay Ming Haoyan with their swords? Or would Ming Haoyan wield the Reaper's scythe and claim their lives? Until the final moment, no one could be certain.

Time flowed slowly. Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian, too, forgot the passage of time, their eyes fixed on the three combatants.

How long had passed? Meng Lingyun and Ming Haoyan were both wounded, their blood staining the entire starry sky. Yet Luo Tian remained unscathed, his golden light radiating as he clashed with Ming Haoyan. The terrifying nature of the Epoch's peak reincarnation body was fully revealed.

Chapter 1210: Victory

In the chaotic void, killing intent surged. Three figures clashed endlessly, their battle captivating all of the Nine Realms.

"Luo Tian is still alive!" In the Ancient Heaven Palace, everyone watched the flickering soul lamp, their faces filled with excitement. To them, as long as Luo Tian lived, there was hope—after all, he had created miracles before.

Compared to the four holy domains and Fire Domain's people in the Ancient Heaven Palace, other sanctuaries—especially the Divine Clan and Demon Realm—felt despair. Their invincible ancestors had already perished, leaving them with no hope. All prepared to face the next battle.

"Spit!" Luo Tian severed Ming Haoyan's arm, then stomped on his body.

"Ming Haoyan. Did you expect this?" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his indomitable body crushing Ming Haoyan almost to dust.

"Still alive?" Meng Lingyun, covered in blood, had suffered heavy injuries. Compared to Ming Haoyan, his wounds were merely light.

"Rebel! Purge the clan and dismantle your long-planned schemes!" Meng Lingyun wielded a branch of the Immortal Marvel Tree, transforming it into an ultimate divine sword and sweeping toward Ming Haoyan.

"Think you can kill me? You're not worthy! I am a descendant of the Demon Clan's royal bloodline, my body flows with noble demon king's essence. How dare you humans kill me!" Ming Haoyan, wounded and nearly shattered, his body oozed gray mist. His eyes burned with fierce resentment.

"Demon King's Arrival!" Ming Haoyan's hands moved swiftly, strange seals emerging from his palms and embedding into his body.

"Buzz..." The next moment, Ming Haoyan's body exploded, and a thick mist obscured Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun's view.

"Roar!" A deafening roar echoed. From the gray mist emerged a massive figure, exhaling gray mist. Its horns were grotesque.

"This is what you forced me to reveal! My true form!" A low growl echoed. A long gray snake appeared before Luo Tian's group.

The snake's scales emitted metallic sounds with every movement. Unlike real snakes, its massive head bore a single green horn. Its eyes—one gray and one emerald—glowed with two-colored flames, radiating coldness across its hundred-foot body.

"Ancestral Clan of the Ancient Times, Illusory Demon Snake. I never realized he had been with me for so long!" Meng Lingyun's eyes lit up with understanding.

The Illusory Demon Snake, the ruler of the Demon Clan, was skilled in illusions. It had even deceived Meng Lingyun, an Epoch Master—showing the terrifying power of its illusions.

"Whine..." A mournful sound echoed. The gray tail lashed through the stars, instantly sweeping toward Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun.

"Be careful. I heard that the bodies of these ancient clans are incredibly strong, especially when restored to their true forms. Each clan rivals the nine human body types!" Meng Lingyun spoke, his voice heavy with concern.

"I'll test this snake's worth!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly. He brandished the Disjointed Soul Sword and slashed at the massive gray snake's tail.

"Crack..." Sparks flew. The next moment, Luo Tian and Ming Haoyan's snake body both retreated. Luo Tian examined his palms, which had slight cracks, and smiled.

"Roar!" The hundred-foot snake body twisted through the gray mist. A deep wound appeared on its tail, spewing blood.

But before Luo Tian could react, the gray snake pierced through space and appeared before him. Its icy fangs glowed with sharp light, lunging to tear Luo Tian apart.

A foul odor filled the air, making Luo Tian's mind waver. Instantly, he entered a special illusion. The massive snake head seemed to be the only thing in existence, making Luo Tian feel overwhelmed—like gazing into a god's eye.

"Be careful!" Meng Lingyun noticed Luo Tian's clear eyes had become迷茫 (dazed), realizing he had fallen for Ming Haoyan's trick. He used the Immortal Marvel Tree to create a storm, enveloping Luo Tian and pulling him away from Ming Haoyan's body.

"Roar!" The snake head roared, inhaling vast amounts of gray mist. It formed a terrifying gray vortex.

At the moment Meng Lingyun rescued Luo Tian, he regained clarity. Though only a brief moment, Luo Tian felt immense fear. The sharp fangs of the gray snake would have been painful even for Meng Haoyan's body.

Ming Haoyan was comparable to the Barbarian Clan Leader. Yet, Meng Haoyan's current body was no longer the same as before—without any Epoch power, he could only rely on close combat for a chance.

"Buzz..." Gray lightning interwove above the gray snake, forming long dragons that circled its head. Finally, they coalesced into a gray star, radiating the power to destroy heaven and earth.

"Die!" A cold voice echoed from the snake's mouth. At the same time, the gray star shot out from the green horn and pierced through space toward Meng Lingyun and Luo Tian.

"I'll block it!" Meng Lingyun stood beside Luo Tian, his hands moving with divine rhythm. Green mist rose from beneath him.

The next moment, a verdant Immortal Marvel Tree sprouted from Meng Lingyun's body, forming a towering tree connected to the gray star.

"Crash..." Upon impact with the Immortal Marvel Tree, the gray star shattered it at the waist, nearly annihilating it. Yet even without complete destruction, its thick trunk and branches vanished, leaving a withered tree before Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun.

"This..." Luo Tian's heart trembled. He looked at Meng Lingyun, concern in his eyes. Meng Lingyun relied on the Immortal Marvel Tree's endless vitality to maintain this state. Now, with the tree reduced to a withered one, Meng Lingyun was clearly in danger.

"Using the Immortal Marvel Tree's life force to block this terrifying gray star!" Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian sighed in admiration.

"His body is strong, but that horn is his greatest weakness. Find a way to remove it!" Meng Lingyun's pale face bore exhaustion as he spoke in Luo Tian's mind.

"Right!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate. While everyone was stunned, he transformed into a golden thread and leapt through space, instantly appearing atop the gray snake's head. He dove down toward the massive green horn.

The gray mist churned. The gray snake sensed danger from above and gathered immense power in its green horn, striking Luo Tian.

"Brace yourself!" Luo Tian knew this was his last chance. If it failed, they would all die. He ignited his soul and surged forward, breaking time's constraints and escaping space's limits. Instantly, he appeared before the green horn, his golden fist radiating powerful waves.

At the same time, the gray star formed and collided with Luo Tian. A thunderous explosion erupted again, shaking the heavens. Meng Lingyun's heart tightened—this was their final chance. If Luo Tian succeeded, the Demon Realm's crisis would be resolved; if not, all hope was lost.

The explosion raged. Terrifying blasts swept out, obscuring the three combatants' view and completely engulfing Luo Tian and Ming Haoyan's forms.

The void trembled. A hunched old man stood in the void, unnoticed by anyone. It seemed he was part of the void itself.

The old man's mechanical body swayed slightly. His lifeless eyes gazed at the edge of the explosion, about to move but stopping abruptly. His eyes flashed with confusion.

"Roar!" A deafening roar echoed from the gray mist, filled with infinite pain. Gray blood formed a river of blood, spewing out.

"Success!" As the explosion faded, Meng Lingyun and the others finally saw the result. Their eyes lit up with joy.

Before them, the gray snake writhed in the void. A golden seven-foot sword was embedded in its head, and a golden figure repeatedly struck the massive snake's head with fists.

"Ha!" Sun Shengtian and Diao Yuanshan laughed, tears of joy streaming down their faces. They watched the gray snake beaten into submission.

"Indeed, you did not disappoint!" Meng Lingyun's half-body floated in the void. His aged face bore exhaustion.

"Crash!" Under their joy, the massive snake head exploded into a mist of blood. It fell from the void and transformed into Ming Haoyan's form—clearly, his current state could no longer sustain his body.

Chapter 1211: Unsealing the Epoch Master's Seal

Below the Four Holy Realms, Ming Haoyan's face was pale. He regained his aged appearance and gazed at Luo Tian standing before him.

"Luo Tian!" Ming Haoyan spoke coldly. His heart was regretful—he never expected his years of planning to be ruined by Luo Tian. If not for him, he would have already opened the Epoch Master's seal and welcomed the Demon Clan's worship.

But all was in vain. The Luo Tian who had possessed Meng Haoyan's body was too powerful. Even the peak of the Epoch's reincarnation body was so strong that it had wounded him severely. If he had delayed even a moment, he would have already perished.

"Kill!" Luo Tian took advantage of his momentum and did not spare Ming Haoyan. His indomitable body roared, brandishing the Disjointed Soul Sword and charging toward Ming Haoyan. He vowed to completely slay Ming Haoyan, ensuring his peace of mind.

"Then I must rely on myself!" Ming Haoyan's eyes flashed with cruelty. He gazed into the distance, his expression resolute.

"Though my plan has changed slightly, it should be enough!" Ming Haoyan's eyes gleamed with coldness. His hands moved, and his body began to crack. Before Luo Tian could attack, he transformed into a mist of blood and dispersed into the void.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian stopped, gazing at Ming Haoyan's form as a mist of blood. He didn't understand what the enemy meant, but his heart grew more cautious.

"Luo Tian, do you think this is over? I originally planned to use Meng Lingyun's other half of his blood, but I accounted for everything except you. It seems I must use my own!" Ming Haoyan's gray soul burned, tearing through space and pushing his blood into the void.

"Buzz..." A massive suction arose from the space, instantly sweeping through the Four Holy Realms' starry sky. The blood essence of the Nine Demon Saints and the residual power from various clans were instantly swept away, rushing into the void.

"Demons' Domain!" Meng Lingyun's eyes flickered with emotion, as if seeing something terrifying through the endless void. He spoke loudly.

"Go!" Luo Tian saw Meng Lingyun's concern and didn't hesitate, following the suction's direction. Through violent spatial turbulence, he instantly appeared beneath the gray starry sky of the Demon Domain.

Compared to the Four Holy Realms, the Demon Domain was normal. But upon entering, Luo Tian smelled a thick scent of blood, making his heart tighten. The sticky blood essence made him uncomfortable, and he frowned slightly.

The Jade Casket with Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian emerged from the void. As soon as it appeared, Meng Lingyun's soul floated out, his eyes showing tension.

"Divine Demon Palace! Hurry!" Meng Lingyun shouted at Luo Tian, his voice filled with urgency. He carried the casket toward the Demon Domain's ultimate location—the Divine Demon Palace.

The gray palace was surrounded by mist, as if countless ghosts circled it. Roars echoed as the massive palace absorbed them. The entire structure appeared sinister.

What startled Luo Tian and his group most was the blood vessel, the Blood-Refining Vessel of an Epoch Treasure. It continuously released blood essence, with countless souls flowing into the palace and filling its eight-positioned massive blood channels.

"This is the blood essence of the Nine Demon Saints who plagued the Nine Realms for years. How many people have been killed to create such thick blood essence!" Sun Shengtian and Diao Yuanshan were shocked, their bodies trembling involuntarily.

"Using the blood essence of billions of human lives as a catalyst, open it! Seal my Demon Clan for eternity!" A low roar echoed from the palace. A gray soul, filled with devotion, appeared above the palace and roared lowly—Ming Haoyan's soul.

"Ha! I'll see how the Nine Realms will withstand the arrival of the Ancient Clans. The Ancient Clans shall return to their former glory, trampling humanity underfoot!" Ming Haoyan showed no hesitation. He flew into the gray flood.

"Buzz..." Blood light surged. The next moment, massive blood essence instantly formed a crimson net, covering the entire Divine Demon Palace.

As for Ming Zhenyan, they had no time to care about his fate. At this moment, dismantling Ming Haoyan's plan was the top priority.

"What to do?" Luo Tian turned to Meng Lingyun, concern in his eyes. Ming Haoyan's years of preparation would not be simple.

Among the four of them, who could match Meng Lingyun's knowledge and methods?

Meng Lingyun furrowed his brows, gazing at the complex patterns on the palace's barrier. Gradually merging with the blood essence net, it filled the intricate patterns.

"These blood essences contain not only billions of lives' vitality but also the residual power from those previous clans. I don't think I'm mistaken—my other leg's blood essence was also refined by Ming Haoyan."

"With so much precious blood, fused together, this bold willpower would break through the seal set by the Epoch Master. If successful, the seal would open!" Meng Lingyun's eyes flashed as he spoke.

"The only way to break it is by using the dominance of bloodline to suppress this blood essence, stopping its flow!" Meng Lingyun's face bore determination as he addressed Luo Tian and the others.

"How? What blood could match billions of human lives' essence, especially with your leg's blood and so much clan power?" Sun Shengtian and Diao Yuanshan felt despair.

"There is. My half-body should be able to!" Meng Lingyun smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

"No!" Luo Tian immediately refused. His eyes were resolute. Meng Lingyun had done him a favor; how could he watch him die?

"Enough! My decision is made. If I don't die, this era may never grant you the chance to ascend. That would be unfair for your kind of prodigies!" Meng Lingyun ignored Luo Tian's words, his voice filled with relief. His half-body flew from the Jade Casket.

"Back then, if I hadn't taken in these nine rebels, perhaps the Nine Realms wouldn't have faced this disaster. I am a traitor to humanity; I must bear the consequences!" Meng Lingyun's voice was resolute. He stopped Luo Tian.

Luo Tian fell silent, gazing into Meng Lingyun's eyes. After a few seconds of eye contact, he saw deep regret in Meng Lingyun's gaze. He knew Meng Lingyun's decision was final.

"Respectfully send off my master!" Luo Tian knelt in midair, gazing at Meng Lingyun with reverence.

Meng Lingyun's body trembled. His aged eyes moistened. This life, his greatest sorrow was taking in nine rebellious disciples—none were satisfactory. Now, Luo Tian calling him master fulfilled a long-held regret.

"Ha! To have such a good disciple before dying is truly the heavens' kindness!" Meng Lingyun laughed.

"Wrong! What are the heavens? A good disciple, today I tell you: the Dao is not everything. Cultivation has no end. Perhaps one day, you will see that beyond the heavens lies more!" Meng Lingyun's face bore dominance. His bold voice echoed through the blood-stained starry sky.

"Ask the world, is there a sage?" Meng Lingyun sighed longingly. His voice carried melancholy and regret. His half-body exploded into a mist of blood, floating above the Divine Demon Palace.

"Stop!" Meng Lingyun's residual soul roared. It merged into the blood mist and rushed into the filling blood channels.

"Buzz..." The bold blood of an Epoch Master radiated divine power. Instantly, the flowing blood essence slowed down.

"Finally succeeded! Using my half-body's blood to suppress billions of lives' and various clan's blood!" Luo Tian and the others sighed deeply, their eyes flashing with sorrow. So many had died, even an Epoch Master—this was the end.

"Buzz..." However, as Luo Tian and his group sighed in relief, the blood essence, though nearly still, continued to flow slightly.

"Is it not over yet? Even my master's half-body blood couldn't stop it!" Diao Yuanshan exclaimed, his eyes filled with disbelief. He hadn't expected the blood essence to be so bold—his master's half-body blood couldn't fully suppress it.

"Blood essence, bold!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light. He gazed at Zhongli Tian's body, a hint of regret in his eyes.

"Forgive me, Soul-Eating Beast Master. I have no choice!" Luo Tian's eyes bore determination.

"Uncle Diao, please take care of my family and loved ones!" Luo Tian addressed Diao Yuanshan. He then turned his gaze to Sun Shengtian, frowning slightly.

"Luo Tian! What are you planning!" Seeing Luo Tian's gaze on him, Sun Shengtian suddenly retreated. His eyes were cautious.

Diao Yuanshan's face also changed slightly, sensing something was off. His voice carried inquiry.

"This blood essence is clearly still flowing. The reincarnation body's blood is bold. I must use Zhongli Tian's body to stop this catastrophe!" Luo Tian's eyes were resolute as he spoke to Diao Yuanshan.

At the same time, Luo Tian was thinking. Should he kill Sun Shengtian? After all, if he died, and Sun Shengtian attacked the Four Holy Realms and Fire Domain, with their current state, they might not withstand it.

Chapter 1212: Reincarnation Blood Drenches the Azure Sky

Under the blood-stained starry sky of the Demon Domain, Luo Tian gazed at Sun Shengtian from afar. He pondered whether to kill him and eliminate the threat.

"Luo Tian, I swear from now on, I will never attack your Four Holy Realms!" Sun Shengtian saw the killing intent in Luo Tian's eyes and quickly spoke, his voice filled with entreaty. The current Luo Tian was too strong—even the mighty Ming Haoyan had perished at his hands. Sun Shengtian knew that no one in the Nine Realms could restrain Luo Tian, who had possessed Zhongli Tian's body.

"Blood Oath!" Luo Tian saw Sun Shengtian issuing a blood oath. His brows slightly relaxed. They had previously stood on the same side, but now he would kill him. This made Luo Tian uncomfortable. He gazed at Sun Shengtian deeply, but did not act. Instead, he turned his gaze to Diao Yuanshan.

"Uncle Diao, I entrust my family and friends to you!" Luo Tian's eyes showed respect as he knelt before Diao Yuanshan. His gratitude for Diao Yuanshan's repeated rescues warranted this bow.

"Luo Tian, what are you doing! Use this old body instead!" Diao Yuanshan's face bore pity. He immediately lifted Luo Tian, scolding him without hesitation and flying toward the slowly rotating barrier.

But as Diao Yuanshan moved, he was instantly suppressed by a powerful pressure. Luo Tian appeared beside him and pulled him back.

"Uncle Diao! Let me do it. Don't let your life be wasted!" Luo Tian smiled, pushing Diao Yuanshan far away. His voice was resolute.

Diao Yuanshan's face darkened, his eyes filled with sorrow. Luo Tian was the one he had watched rise to prominence. Yet before he could shine, he would perish. A prodigy destined for the Epoch Master's title—dying like this was unbearable for Diao Yuanshan.

But he had no other choice. When he reached the blood-stained barrier, he felt a powerful pressure that made it hard to breathe. He knew Luo Tian was right—perhaps even his death couldn't stop the barrier's operation.

"As long as I'm here, I won't let my family and friends suffer!" Luo Tian roared. His body became a meteor, and his gray soul began to burn within Zhongli Tian's body.

The next moment, Zhongli Tian's powerful body slowly expanded and fell toward the blood-stained barrier.

"Master's body must not be harmed!" As Luo Tian was about to detonate Zhongli Tian's body, a terrifying pressure echoed through the void. A withered figure emerged from the void and stood before Luo Tian, as if unaware of Zhongli Tian's pressure. Its mechanical body grabbed Zhongli Tian's body.

At the same time, the withered hand extended and grasped toward Zhongli Tian's head. A strong suction emerged from the palm, and Luo Tian's gray soul offered no resistance, appearing on the withered hand. His eyes flashed with fear.

Too fast—between the old man emerging from the void and capturing Luo Tian's soul, it was only a moment. Even Luo Tian hadn't reacted.

"Who are you!" Diao Yuanshan shouted, gazing at the withered figure in the sky. He sensed no life from the old man but felt despair from his presence.

"Master's body must not be harmed!" The old man's mechanical voice echoed. He tossed Luo Tian's soul into the Jade Casket. Luo Tian suffered no damage.

As soon as Luo Tian returned to his body, sweat trickled down his face. The old man's presence was terrifying—perhaps even more so than Ming Haoyan.

"He called Zhongli Tian 'master.' Could he be the Soul-Eating Beast?" Luo Tian instantly understood. His face bore a bitter smile as he gazed at the old man protecting Zhongli Tian.

"Not human. It must be something like a puppet, but after long years, it has gained simple consciousness. I felt the Epoch Master's aura on him—unavoidable reverence!" Diao Yuanshan spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian. Zhongli Tian's body was brought by Luo Tian; he naturally knew more.

"It must be crafted by the Epoch Master!" Luo Tian thought of the one who held the Immortal Medicine, Miaoyin. He never expected Miaoyin to have arranged so much to save Zhongli Tian's body.

The puppet old man gazed at Luo Tian with lifeless eyes, then said nothing. It took Zhongli Tian's body and vanished from their sight without acknowledging their thoughts.

"Alas..." Luo Tian shook his head lightly, a bitter expression on his face. The old man had taken Zhongli Tian's body—how would they stop the barrier?

"I'll do it!" Diao Yuanshan spoke to Luo Tian, his voice filled with a smile. Indeed, he was happy now that Luo Tian wouldn't die.

"I'll help!" Sun Shengtian's eyes flickered. He sighed deeply, his voice filled with reluctance. Who wouldn't fear death?

"Huh?" Hearing Sun Shengtian's words, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. His gaze toward Sun Shengtian changed. He hadn't expected him to stay at this moment.

"Don't look at me like that. I am the Divine Clan's god-king, my blood flows with divine essence. My ancestors have already perished. I, Sun Shengtian, am no coward. However, Luo Tian, I hope our two domains' grudge ends here!" Sun Shengtian gazed at Luo Tian, seeing the image of him subduing the Nine Realms. Such a prodigy—no one could stop his steps.

Although Sun Miechen was also extraordinary, Sun Shengtian knew he was slightly inferior to Luo Tian.

"You're all no good. I'll do it. I am also a reincarnation body. My blood can even revive an Epoch Master. I don't believe I can't stop this slow-moving barrier!" Luo Tian spoke, and before the others could react, his golden body flew toward the barrier. He transformed into a mist of blood and gazed at the Four Holy Realms, without hesitation, entering the blood mist and burning within it.

"No!" Diao Yuanshan's legs spread wide. His murky eyes flowed with tears, his expression filled with sorrow.

At the same time, in the Ancient Heaven Palace, people from both domains had tears in their eyes. Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan four women collapsed to the ground, blood flowing from their mouths.

"My son!" Zhang Qiu Yue rushed into Luo Nantian's arms, crying loudly. Her entire body seemed to have lost its soul.

"Luotian! How could he die!" Gu Lei and Zheng Xin spoke in disbelief, watching the extinguished soul lamp.
