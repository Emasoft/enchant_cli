"Let's go!" Run Hongyu shook his head, his gaze first falling upon the chief of the guards. Surrounded by his men, he stepped out of the courtyard toward the central hall of Tianhun City's Lord's Mansion. After nearly a quarter of an hour, the chief led Run Hongyu through winding paths, causing his brows to furrow slightly.

"Boom..." As Run Hongyu puzzled over the situation, a deep sound rose before him. The chief of guards spat blood, his chest caved in, and he collapsed onto the ground.

Chapter 2231: Who Am I?

"Boom..." The chief of guards lay on the ground, his face pale, gazing at Run Hongyu.

"This..." Run Hongyu was momentarily stunned. The chief had no one attacking him, yet he had struck himself with such force that it was clearly a severe injury.

"Medic Sage, you should leave. I Qiu Hu am a crude man. When I returned from Longhu Mountain, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have survived. How could I let you go to your death!"

"Boom boom boom..."

As Qiu Hu's words finished, a series of deep sounds echoed. The soldiers also collapsed onto the ground like Qiu Hu.

"Medic Sage, you must flee! We were injured by you!" The soldiers cried out, collapsing onto the ground.

Among these soldiers, none were without wounds. Over the years, Run Hongyu had saved countless lives.

"You..." Run Hongyu gazed at Qiu Hu and the soldiers lying on the ground, speechless. He hadn't expected these soldiers to come for him.

"Ah, you've truly stayed in Tianhun City long enough. The popularity here is impressive!" Luo Tian remarked, watching Run Hongyu standing there.

"Thank you," Run Hongyu sighed softly. He waved his hands, and a surge of green energy radiated from them, instantly enveloping everyone. A series of silver needles shot forth from his hands toward the group. Luo Tian also chuckled, sending pills into their mouths. With Luo Tian and Run Hongyu's cooperation, the injuries of Qiu Hu and the soldiers were no match for them.

In a moment, Qiu Hu and the soldiers returned to normal. Their eyes reflected disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian and Run Hongyu.

"Alright, lead us to the Lord's Mansion!" Run Hongyu chuckled, lifting Qiu Hu and patting the dust off his body.

"Medic Sage, the Lord intends to kill you. You should flee quickly!" Qiu Hu spoke, his voice laced with urgency. Though he was deeply shocked by Luo Tian and Run Hongyu's joint effort to heal their severe injuries, it didn't mean they could overcome the True Immortal Peak-level Chen Tiancheng.

"It's fine, I know what I'm doing," Run Hongyu said, taking the initiative to walk toward the Lord's Mansion.

"This..." Qiu Hu and his men were stunned. They didn't understand why Run Hongyu would go to the Lord's Mansion to die. In their view, Luo Tian and Run Hongyu had no chance against Chen Tiancheng.

"Relax, big brother!" Luo Tian patted Qiu Hu's shoulder and followed Run Hongyu.

"This is the first time I've seen such a thing!" Qiu Hu and his men shook their heads, following Luo Tian.

A group of people exited the corner and quickly reached the heart of Tianhun City. The guards at the Lord's Mansion hesitated slightly upon seeing Run Hongyu but let him in.

Run Hongyu had visited the Lord's Mansion before. He quickly found Chen Tiancheng's residence, while Luo Tian followed behind him with a constant smile.

"Isn't it the Medic Sage Run Hongyu? Why have you come again? Last time, the Lord nearly killed you. This time, you've been captured," the people of the Lord's Mansion said with surprise and a long sigh. Everyone in Tianhun City knew Run Hongyu's character, and they didn't wish for him to lose his life.

However, these people were merely sighing. After all, this was Tianhun City, Chen Tiancheng's territory.

In a large courtyard, a middle-aged man sat there with a red glow on his face. Beside him sat a young man, both chatting and laughing.

"Uncle Pang, I hope you'll help us establish a branch of Zhongtian Business Association in Tianhun City," the middle-aged man said to the young man. This man was Chen Tiancheng, the Lord of Tianhun City. The young man had oil on his face, wore a brocade robe, and his eyes seemed hollow despite his late-stage True Immortal cultivation.

"Uncle, rest assured. You not only saved my life but also betrothed your daughter to me. I'll handle this upon returning. This is something I can manage!" The young man smiled with confidence.

"You eight, have you decided? If you rejoin me, I'll overlook your past service and let you keep your lives. If not, today will be your last day!" The young man spoke to the eight men lying on the ground with weak breaths.

"Impossible..." The eight men spoke in unison, their voices barely audible but filled with determination.

"It seems I must personally end your lives today!" The young man sneered, stepping toward the eight men.

At the same time, Luo Tian and others arrived at the courtyard's entrance. They pushed open the door and saw Chen Tiancheng and the young man.

"Luo Tian!"

"Pang Guang!" Upon entering the courtyard, Run Hongyu and Chen Tiancheng didn't speak first. Luo Tian and the young man shouted each other's names, their voices laced with surprise.

"Qiu Hu, well done. Go and collect your reward!" Chen Tiancheng saw Run Hongyu entering and was slightly startled, not expecting him to recover so quickly. However, he still thought it was useless.

"Yes!" Qiu Hu sighed in his heart but chose to leave, leading the soldiers out.

"Hahahaha! Luo Tian, I didn't expect you to still be alive. Not all debts are repaid at the right time. Sending these eight useless men to kill me, you had a big dream!" Pang Guang laughed loudly, his voice filled with satisfaction.

"Uncle, it's this young man who had these eight slaves kill me. Uncle, please help me subdue him!" Pang Guang addressed Chen Tiancheng.

Luo Tian's strength was known to Pang Guang, but Luo Tian was merely a late-stage True Immortal. Against Chen Tiancheng, a peak-level True Immortal, he was nothing.

"Master..." Guiyi spoke, struggling to stand up with a wobbly body. His weak gaze looked at Luo Tian, his voice filled with guilt.

However, Guiyi and the other seven didn't explain. Previously, they had chased Pang Guang with their injured bodies from the battlefield all the way to Tianhun City. Just as they were about to kill Pang Guang, Chen Tiancheng had saved him. In the eyes of the Yama Eight Guards, failure was failure; there was no need to explain. Luo Tian furrowed his brows but quickly guessed that the Yama Eight Guards' failure was related to Chen Tiancheng. Without Chen Tiancheng, it would have been hard for Pang Guang to escape the Yama Eight Guards' pursuit.

"Uncle, rest assured. I'll avenge this for you!" Chen Tiancheng chuckled softly but frowned slightly at Luo Tian, recognizing the name.

"Uncle, hahahaha!"

"You're just after this fool's Zhongtian Business Association, right? Do you know who I am?" Luo Tian sneered.

"I don't care who you are. If you offend my Uncle Pang Guang, then there's only one path: death!"

"Also, Run Hongyu, have you decided? Join me, and I might spare your life!" Chen Tiancheng stood up, his aura radiating outward as he gazed at Run Hongyu.

"Impossible!" Run Hongyu lightly shook his head, directly ignoring Chen Tiancheng's aura.

"It seems you're refusing a drink and choosing punishment!" Chen Tiancheng sneered, stepping toward Luo Tian and Run Hongyu.

"Boom..." Waves of energy surged outward, an invisible pressure radiating from Chen Tiancheng's body.

"Have you heard of Xinghe Mansion?" As Chen Tiancheng had just taken two steps, Luo Tian's scornful words echoed in his ears, causing him to pause slightly.

"Xinghe Mansion's Master Ye Wudao is my foster father. Ye Zhan is my uncle, and Ye Tian is my elder! You dare to touch me?"

"I am also the commander of Bontian City. Do you believe that if I send a single message, my men will surely flatten this small Tianhun City!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, his voice like a thunderclap that struck Chen Tiancheng's body.

"Ye Wudao of Xinghe Mansion's foster son!"

"Bontian City's commander Luo Tian!" Chen Tiancheng's mind roared. His ears echoed with Luo Tian's words, each one he could not afford to offend.

"Of course, these are just identities. I told you this so that you know I won't have any problems killing you!" As Chen Tiancheng was stunned, Luo Tian's cold voice echoed in his ears. A powerful sense of crisis instantly brought Chen Tiancheng back to his senses.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian vanished like teleportation, activating Huangquan Step. He appeared before Chen Tiancheng, his black sword pressing down to strike him.

Luo Tian's first move was the second stage of Sword Dao. His black sword severed space, instantly descending upon Chen Tiancheng's head.

"Dead!" Chen Tiancheng hadn't expected Luo Tian to attack suddenly. By the time he reacted, Luo Tian's fierce sword had already come down. Chen Tiancheng was no slouch; he quickly reacted, raising his hand to clash with Longyuan Sword. His hand flashed with brilliance, and a gray great sword appeared in his hands.

"Crack..." The collision sound echoed. A wild wave of energy spread outward until the sound was heard, and people only then realized.

"Step back... Step back..." Luo Tian took a few steps back, his eyes filled with surprise. Meanwhile, Chen Tiancheng's long sword also struck his shoulder, and a creaking sound echoed from his knees.

"Good!" Luo Tian chuckled softly. He stepped on the ground and rushed toward Chen Tiancheng again.

"Let's talk reasonably!"

"There's still room for negotiation!" Chen Tiancheng's face slightly changed. It wasn't that he feared Luo Tian, but he feared the forces behind him.

"Negotiate your mother!" However, Luo Tian shouted loudly and swung his sword again.

"You dare to provoke me! I'm not someone you can easily bully!" Chen Tiancheng's face darkened. He gripped his great sword and met Luo Tian's sword.

Chapter 2232: Killing with a Single Stroke

In the Lord's Mansion of Tianhun City, thunderous sounds continued. Luo Tian wielded Longyuan Sword with an overwhelming aura, continuously striking.

The gray great sword was swung by Chen Tiancheng, swirling and dancing. The two clashed repeatedly, shaking the heavens and earth.

"Is someone attacking the Lord's Mansion?" The people of the Lord's Mansion looked shocked, flying toward Chen Tiancheng's courtyard.

"How strong he is! Even Chen Tiancheng can't subdue him!" Pang Guang stood on the ground, watching the two clashing. He trembled, not expecting Luo Tian to be so powerful.

"I should escape!" Pang Guang thought of fleeing. He felt it was unsafe to stay here.

"Where do you think you're going?" As Pang Guang just started to leave, a green scythe appeared before him. Eight waves of killing intent surged, causing cold sweat to form on Pang Guang's face.

"Open up!" Pang Guang shouted and a crude sword appeared in his hand, clashing with the green scythe. The collision echoed, and Pang Guang took a step back.

But he had barely steadied himself when another attack came, making his face pale. The attackers were the Yama Eight Guards. When Luo Tian clashed with Chen Tiancheng, Run Hongyu had saved the Yama Eight Guards. Though they hadn't fully recovered, they were fine. The eight men immediately attacked Pang Guang, as it was Luo Tian's command.

"Dead! This kid is so strong!" Chen Tiancheng was also very shocked. The two had clashed for over twenty rounds. At first, Chen Tiancheng hadn't dared to strike hard to avoid injuring Luo Tian, but he had been wounded. After several rounds, Chen Tiancheng was shocked to find that no matter how strong his attacks were, Luo Tian could counter them and even retaliate.

"Sky魂 Puppet!" Chen Tiancheng roared, his hands moving. Gray energy surged, True Immortal power spread, and six gray figures coalesced into Chen Tiancheng's form. They rushed toward Luo Tian.

Six puppets, all with late-stage True Immortal strength, their entire bodies gray. Their gray eyes emitted a radiant light as they rushed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly. He chuckled and activated Huangquan Step, easily dodging the six puppets' attacks.

"Buzz..." However, Chen Tiancheng could still attack Luo Tian. He moved his hands, True Immortal power surged again, and a gray star formed, descending from the sky toward Luo Tian's direction.

At this moment, Luo Tian was clashing with the six puppets. The gray star's impact point was Luo Tian's path.

"Is that all you have?" Luo Tian chuckled and punched, four overlapping punches striking the massive gray star.

"Boom boom..." The thunderous sound echoed. The gray star shattered, turning into wild True Immortal power that scattered outward.

At the same time, the six gray puppets' attacks also arrived. If it were a peak-level True Immortal, facing the six puppets simultaneously would have been difficult. But Luo Tian didn't care. He swung Longyuan Sword, and black sword energy spread in all directions.

"Need help?" Run Hongyu stood on the ground, watching Luo Tian clashing fiercely with Chen Tiancheng. He spoke to Luo Tian.

"Watch carefully!" Luo Tian laughed, and six booming sounds echoed. His sword aura collided with the six puppets' attacks, repelling them.

"Manifesting the Heaven and Earth!" Luo Tian roared. His body suddenly expanded, forming a thousand-zhang-tall giant that stood in the Lord's Mansion. His thick foot stepped toward Chen Tiancheng.

The heavy pressure caused Chen Tiancheng's face to change. He quickly moved his hands, and the six gray puppets shattered into mist, gathering toward Chen Tiancheng.

"Boom boom boom..."

The next moment, the gray mist coalesced. It was no less than Luo Tian's Manifesting the Heaven and Earth.

"Get out!" Chen Tiancheng roared, punching. His punch struck Luo Tian's descending foot.

The thunderous sound spread in all directions. Luo Tian's massive body retreated, and Chen Tiancheng also took a step back, with many buildings collapsing.

"Again!" Luo Tian shouted. He activated the second and third steps of Manqi, rushing toward Chen Tiancheng.

"Great Yin Forty-Nine!" Chen Tiancheng's heart trembled. His hands quickly changed, and a Taiji diagram formed. At the same time, the sky's diagram continuously dazzled, with dense seals spreading outward, forming a Dao Diagram. The aura was grand and powerful, rushing toward Luo Tian for two steps.

Boom... Boom...

Two deep sounds echoed. The heavens cracked, and the winds reversed. Everyone's minds were shaken, with chaotic energy spreading outward.

"Good thing we're far enough away. The battle of a peak-level True Immortal is beyond our involvement!" The people of the Lord's Mansion looked shocked, watching the storm that erupted.

"Cough cough..." Luo Tian and Chen Tiancheng both returned to their normal size, each coughing blood.

"Don't fight! I surrender!" Chen Tiancheng's face was pale. He looked at Luo Tian, shocked by his strength. If it weren't for him creating a complex Dao Diagram, he might have already been severely injured or dead.

"Good, strong!" Luo Tian wiped his lips, secretly admiring that Chen Tiancheng was stronger than Xue Zilong. As for the fourth step, Luo Tian didn't intend to use it; he didn't want to sit in that small cart for several days.

"You say no fight and it's over? What are you?" Luo Tian sneered, his hands moving again. Divine laws flew from his hands, instantly enveloping a hundred zhang around.

"Buzz..." Run Hongyu waved his hand. Chen Tiancheng's face suddenly changed. He grabbed, distorting space. A series of silver needles appeared in people's sight through the spatial distortion.

"Luo Xiong, rest for a while!" Run Hongyu chuckled softly. He waved his hand again and twisted his body.

"Get out..." Chen Tiancheng's face changed. He looked at Run Hongyu standing there, and his long sword spun rapidly.

Sparks flew, each spark was a silver needle.

"Buzz..." As Chen Tiancheng blocked those needles, Run Hongyu's figure appeared behind him. His hand formed a knife grip and stabbed toward Chen Tiancheng's back.

"This!" Luo Tian was shocked, watching Run Hongyu behind Chen Tiancheng. He also looked at the place where Run Hongyu had stood, finding that his figure was still there. Moreover, Run Hongyu's hand wasn't holding anything; it was a nearly transparent dagger. One would hardly notice it unless carefully observed.

"Run Hongyu's assassination technique is truly divine!" Luo Tian thought in awe. He mused that if Run Hongyu really wanted to assassinate someone, no immortal king could escape. Chen Tiancheng had fought Luo Tian for half a day and was injured. Now he also had to face Run Hongyu's silver needles, his mind was scattered, and he hadn't sensed Run Hongyu's disappearance. Thus, he had been careless.

As Run Hongyu appeared, Chen Tiancheng's heart jolted. His body almost instinctively shrank.

"Pu..." Blood spewed from Chen Tiancheng's back. One strike and he was gone, Run Hongyu's figure disappearing from the spot and reappearing at his original position.

"The Medic Sage is so strong. Is this his true strength? Then how did he get injured by the Lord and almost die?" People immediately became chaotic, their eyes filled with disbelief. They knew Run Hongyu had strength but hadn't expected it to be so变态. If it weren't for Chen Tiancheng's quick reaction, he would have already been a corpse.

"One hand heals people with medical skills; the other kills with assassination techniques. Healing requires a heart of benevolence, but once the identity changes, Run Hongyu becomes a cold-blooded killer!" Luo Tian finally understood why Run Hongyu had been injured by Chen Tiancheng. It was because his identity at that time was a healer.

"Pu..." As Luo Tian mused, the Yama Eight Guards finally severed Pang Guang's head.

"Master, I'm sorry. The mission is complete!" Guiyi spoke, his voice filled with solemnity. He handed Pang Guang's head to Luo Tian.

"From now on, follow me!" Luo Tian pointed his finger. Nine-color flames engulfed Pang Guang's head, turning it into ashes that disappeared in Guiyi's hands.

"Yes!" The eight men spoke in unison. They stepped behind Luo Tian, their eyes coldly looking at the people of the Lord's Mansion. If anyone dared to attack Luo Tian, they would not hesitate to kill them.

As Luo Tian and others spoke, Chen Tiancheng had three holes in his body. However, he still swung his great sword and slashed wildly. He didn't even touch a single hair of Run Hongyu.

"魂噬天下!" Chen Tiancheng roared, opening his mouth to suck. A gray whirlpool appeared above him. He knew he had to find Run Hongyu; otherwise, he would truly be in danger. An invisible pressure descended immediately, and within a hundred zhang around Chen Tiancheng, it seemed as if his powerful spirit had occupied the area.

"End it. It's getting boring!" Luo Tian looked at Chen Tiancheng, who seemed to have found Run Hongyu's form. He moved his hands, and divine laws flowed again.

"Buzz..." A terrifying aura pressed down, instantly enveloping Chen Tiancheng and causing his face to change.

"You seem to have forgotten me." Luo Tian spoke softly. Under the Heavenly Human Dao Law, that feeling of control instantly made Luo Tian's face show a slight smile.

"What is this thing? You're not even a late-stage True Immortal..." Chen Tiancheng's face showed fear, looking at Luo Tian standing there with a smile.

"You're behind me!" Luo Tian spoke. He placed his hand on his neck and lightly sliced it.

"What?" Chen Tiancheng's eyes showed confusion. He asked, but his neck suddenly felt cold. His words never came out.

Run Hongyu appeared, his nearly transparent dagger stained with blood. He lightly shook it, and the dagger disappeared again.

Chapter 2233: Journey to Shenglong Sect

The Lord of Tianhun City, Chen Tiancheng, a peak-level True Immortal with connections everywhere. Though Tianhun City was in the northernmost part of the immortal world, it remained prosperous. Yet this formidable strength had died, killed by a young man's hand and the Medic Sage Run Hongyu, who was highly respected in Tianhun City.

The people of the Lord's Mansion looked at Run Hongyu standing there without a ripple, shocked. They hadn't expected Chen Tiancheng to truly die at Run Hongyu's hands.

At this moment, Run Hongyu's aura had changed. He seemed like a death god, no longer the benevolent Medic Sage people once knew.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian spoke softly, stepping toward the teleportation array of Tianhun City. The Yama Eight Guards had cold faces, tightly following behind Luo Tian.

People naturally cleared a path for Luo Tian and others, their faces filled with reverence as they watched Luo Tian and ten people leave.

As for what changes would come to Tianhun City and the troubles it might bring, Luo Tian didn't want to think about it. He was too lazy to care; returning to Xinghe Mansion, with its strength, unless it were the Nine Immortal Mountains, no one would dare trouble him.

After walking for a quarter of an hour, Luo Tian and ten people reached the teleportation array. The person in charge of guarding it looked terrified, opening the teleportation array for Luo Tian and others alone.

Familiar fluctuations spread. A dizzying sensation invaded everyone, and Luo Tian and others appeared on the other end of the teleportation array. Noisy sounds echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

"Xuanti City!" Luo Tian spoke softly, looking at the surroundings. This place was somewhat familiar to him; he had come here more than once.

"Let's go, I'll treat you to dinner!" Luo Tian was in a good mood. He spoke to Run Hongyu and the Yama Eight Guards.

"Move aside!" As Luo Tian's words had just finished, a series of shouts echoed in his ears.

The teleportation array beside them was empty. However, several figures walked toward the teleportation array next to them.

"Today I'm in a good mood. I won't argue with you!" Luo Tian chuckled, leading Run Hongyu and the Yama Eight Guards out of the teleportation array toward a restaurant in Xuanti City. In Bontian City, Luo Tian hadn't eaten well for a long time; he was quite hungry.

"Get out of the way! Don't you see we're handling business for Feishen Sect?" As Luo Tian and others just stepped out of the teleportation array, a cold voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

At the same time, a golden hand reached toward Luo Tian and others. Though this large hand's power wasn't strong enough to kill Luo Tian and others, it could still send them flying.

"I killed one of Feishen Sect's geniuses before!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly but continued walking forward as if he hadn't seen the golden hand.

"Buzz..." A green scythe transformed into a streak of light, cutting through the golden hand. Guiyi remained expressionless and followed Luo Tian.

"Ah?"

"A high-level expert?" As the golden hand was severed, a playful voice echoed. A series of booming sounds followed.

A group of figures filled the street, appearing before Luo Tian and ten people. There were over a thousand people, with a young man leading them. His golden robe's sleeves had a sun embroidered on it.

"Feishen Sect's elite disciples!" Guiyi spoke softly, his voice filled with solemnity. The eight of them had once been elite killers of Zhongtian Business Association. Killers focused on intelligence, so they had knowledge about the hundred sects of Zhongtian.

"Who are you? Daring to block our path?" The young man stood out with a playful expression, his eyes filled with disdain.

"Who am I? You don't need to know. Is this your road?" Luo Tian sneered. Here, even if Feishen Sect was powerful, they had to lie low.

"Good, I'll remember you!" The young man chuckled, his eyes flashing with killing intent. If it weren't for Xuanti City, the young man would have shown Luo Tian his strength.

"We're going!" The young man sneered and stepped toward the teleportation array, not paying attention to Luo Tian and others because they had more important matters.

Luo Tian didn't pay attention to the young man, stepping through a thousand cold gazes toward Xuanti City.

"Master, this person is named Miao Leishan. He's one of Feishen Sect's geniuses. He rarely appears, and I don't know why he suddenly appeared with such a grand display!" Guiyi spoke, recounting all the information he knew.

"Move aside..." As they walked, another shout echoed. A group of people continuously walked on the wide street toward the teleportation array.

"What's happening?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, looking at Xuanti City's chaos. The groups of people weren't just from Feishen Sect but also other sects.

"Unfortunately, Shenglong Sect has been in the middle of the Three Heavens for a few years and is about to be destroyed."

"This time, four sects have united to attack. Shenglong Sect seems doomed!" Luo Tian was confused but the people of Xuanti City knew the background, whispering among themselves.

"Shenglong Sect is under attack by four sects. Feishen Sect, Ziyang Sect, Qingfeng Sect, and Juling Sect are all top-ranking sects among the hundred sects. Just one of them could destroy Shenglong Sect, let alone four!" Luo Tian learned why from the people's whispers.

Luo Tian's eyes slightly cooled. Shenglong Sect was his first sect in the immortal world, and it had given him a strong sense of belonging.

"Let's go. No dinner!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his eyes flashing with killing intent. The Yama Eight Guards' gazes also turned icy. Run Hongyu, who had changed identities, remained cold.

Ten people's auras changed dramatically. They turned around and headed toward the teleportation array, their imposing presence making people dare not underestimate them.

"I'm no longer the one who could be slaughtered. This time, I'll settle both old and new debts!" Luo Tian's killing intent surged. He pushed through the crowd toward the teleportation array.

"Get out..." Luo Tian quickly reached the edge of the teleportation array. At this moment, the massive teleportation array was crowded with people, over ten thousand in total. This was just one group; each sect had its own.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian extended his hand, a black hand grabbing ten unknown sect disciples and throwing them out of the teleportation array. He stepped toward the teleportation array.

"Bold!" Shouts echoed, and four sects' elite disciples scolded loudly, their eyes on Luo Tian.

"Who is bold?" Luo Tian sneered. Despite facing ten thousand people, his aura didn't diminish. His body was filled with ghostly energy, and countless shadows flowed behind him, as if an endless number of souls.

Cold eyes, wherever they gazed, made the disciples feel a chill. It was as if they had fallen into the Nine幽 Hell.

The Yama Eight Guards stood in position, their eyes watching the four sects' disciples. If Luo Tian gave the order, even in Xuanti City, they would charge forward to fight these people.

"Again you!" Miao Leishan stood among the crowd, his face twisted with hatred. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to choose to sit on the same teleportation array as them.

"Do you know what you're doing?" Miao Leishan spoke coldly. The other leaders of the genius students also had cold expressions, feeling Luo Tian was seeking death.

"It's just sitting on a teleportation array. It's not your business!" Luo Tian replied coldly, already calculating in his mind. Once they exited the teleportation array, he would eliminate these ten thousand people. These elite disciples had many True Immortals; the leaders were even late-stage True Immortals. Killing them would also ease Shenglong Sect's pressure.

Luo Tian had also deduced that the four sects might not have attacked Shenglong Sect yet. This could be transporting people to Shenglong Sect, or they might already be attacking it. These disciples were going for support.

"Good, let you sit. I'll see if you have the life to sit on this teleportation array!" Miao Leishan spoke coldly. Here, he didn't dare to cause trouble, but once they arrived at their destination, they could do as they pleased. Killing these ten thousand people would be enough for them to finish Luo Tian and his group.

"Started!" As Miao Leishan's words had just finished, the person in charge of opening the teleportation array was quite impatient. He spoke to everyone.

"Quickly!" Miao Leishan shouted, and the ten thousand people focused their eyes on Luo Tian and others, their faces filled with hatred.

"Buzz..." The familiar fluctuations enveloped them. The teleportation array activated, and the ten thousand people disappeared from Xuanti City.

The next moment, the ten thousand people appeared in a small city named Zhongshan City. This city was under Shenglong Sect's control, but it had been occupied by the four sects and turned into a teleportation array.

Luo Tian immediately took out his Longyuan Sword, swinging it and striking toward the nearest four sect disciples.

Black sword energy, filled with terrifying killing intent, struck them before they could react. Their heads were severed and they died instantly in the teleportation array.

"What's happening? Why is there a blood smell? What's this wet thing?" Other disciples looked confused, seeing the blood splattered on their faces.

"Damn it! Kill them!" Miao Leishan quickly regained his composure, seeing Luo Tian had killed dozens of people with one strike. He shouted.

"Is it him!" Upon hearing Miao Leishan's words, people realized and raised waves of energy. A series of martial arts techniques凝聚 in the sky, rushing toward Luo Tian and ten people.

"I'll kill those leaders!" Run Hongyu chuckled softly. He moved his body, disappearing from people's sight.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded. He watched the series of martial arts techniques descending from the sky. His hands moved, and a black vortex suddenly spread, drawing out cold ghostly claws from the void. The chilling energy swept over and clashed with the gathered martial arts techniques, while his other hand swung a sword, unleashing an infinite wave of sword energy with a thunderous sound.

Chapter 2234: Waiting

The sword energy and the hellish ghost claws collided with the martial arts techniques, producing a deafening roar in the sky of Zhongshan City. Luo Tian's head caused vast areas of space to break, instantly causing the entire Zhongshan City to tremble. The teleportation array beneath their feet also stopped operating.

"What's happening?" People of Zhongshan City looked shocked, gazing at the shattered space several thousand zhang high. Wind and clouds reversed, carrying the terrifying fluctuations beyond the heavens. People flew toward the teleportation array.

On another side, as Luo Tian caused this commotion, the teleportation array leading to Zhongshan City in Xuanti City also stopped. Those preparing to teleport stood on the array, stunned.

"Go!" Luo Tian's face showed coldness. Facing ten thousand people, he had no fear at all because he quickly discovered that there were no strong individuals among these ten thousand. None of those coming toward them were strong either; the strongest was only a late-stage True Immortal, with no peak-level True Immortals.

The Yama Eight Guards' faces flashed coldly. Their eight green scythes emitted a chilling light, surrounding Luo Tian and rushing toward the disciples.

Nine people in total became a meat grinder, beginning to mercilessly harvest the lives of the four sects' disciples.

"Who is he!" Miao Leishan's face showed shock, watching Luo Tian and nine people rush into the crowd as if nothing. They could not approach within ten zhang of them.

"It's so comfortable!" Luo Tian looked at the Yama Eight Guards constantly attacking. He didn't need to fight himself unless it was a late-stage True Immortal.

"How strong they are!" The leaders looked shocked, watching Luo Tian and nine people killing the four sects' disciples like slaughtering chickens.

"You should think about yourself!" As Miao Leishan was shocked, a voice like death echoed behind him. An invisible dagger tore through space and pierced Miao Leishan's back.

Miao Leishan's face still showed shock. He hadn't felt anyone behind him, but his back suddenly ached, and he fell to the ground. As Miao Leishan fell, his eyes showed regret. He regretted thinking of killing Luo Tian.

Run Hongyu paused and disappeared from the spot, causing people's shock. Run Hongyu's appearance was only a moment. Not even them, but even a peak-level True Immortal would find it hard to locate Run Hongyu. Let alone Miao Leishan, a late-stage True Immortal.

Ten people brought devastating destruction to the four sects' people in Zhongshan City. Everyone was terrified, not expecting ten people's strength to be so strong.

"One hundred... one thousand... ten thousand..." As time passed, after half an hour, the ten thousand people brought by Miao Leishan and the other ten thousand remaining in Zhongshan City were all slaughtered by Luo Tian's ten people. In an instant, the entire Zhongshan City became a deserted city. Luo Tian struck his hand, and a black hand smashed the ground, shattering the teleportation array's markings. This prevented the four sects from continuing to send people.
