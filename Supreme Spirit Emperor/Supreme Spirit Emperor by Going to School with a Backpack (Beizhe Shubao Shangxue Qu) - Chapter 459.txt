Time flowed slowly as Long Li pondered the pros and cons, while Sun Luoshan and his two companions possessed ample patience, waiting for Long Li's response. They knew Long Li would eventually yield.

An hour passed in silence, and Sun Luoshan's group smiled as they addressed Long Li: "Have you made up your mind? Shall we proceed with the handover?"

Seeing their smug expressions, Long You Ran clenched her teeth in anger. She recalled how Sun Luoshan and his men had dared not utter a word when Luo Tian was present. Yet, in just a few days, they had turned from obedient servants to rebellious wolves.

"Such a lively scene," as Sun Luoshan's words faded, a leisurely voice echoed in everyone's ears.

"Ugh..." A howl resounded, and a streak of blue lightning descended from the sky, striking Sun Luoshan's front. It tackled him to the ground.

A pair of eyes—one emerald, one golden—glinted with cold teeth and a chilling breath that landed on Sun Luoshan's face, causing him to sweat in terror.

"Is it the Howling Moon Wolf!" The crowd instantly recognized the figure that had toppled Sun Luoshan. Though diminished in size, they still identified this dominant clan of the Endless Forest. Over the years, many had perished at the jaws of these wolves.

"What's going on!" Everyone was stunned. They hadn't expected the Howling Moon Wolf to emerge from the Endless Forest.

"Crunch..." Sharp teeth sank into Sun Luoshan's bald head, creating two blood holes.

"Don't kill him!" A calm voice echoed, as if from the heavens. His white robe fluttered in the wind, and a youthful face descended from the sky, smiling as he appeared before them.

"Roar..." The Howling Moon Wolf growled and then leaped after Zhang Lie and Zhang Feng.

"Damn it..." Upon seeing the white figure, Zhang Feng and Zhang Lie immediately thought of fleeing.

Though their speed was swift, it paled in comparison to the Howling Moon Wolf's celestial-grade prowess. In an instant, they were chased and dragged back into view.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing the white-clad figure, Long Li and Long You Ran were stunned, their eyes filled with intense joy.

"Luo... Luo Tian..." Others also bore expressions of disbelief, gazing at the calm young man.

Luo Tian extended his hand, and a stream of soul threads emerged from it, penetrating the three men's bodies.

"Luo Sect Leader, we were wrong!" Sun Luoshan and his companions trembled violently upon seeing Luo Tian, especially the Howling Moon Wolf beside him. Their voices were weak.

"A monster! He's tamed a Howling Moon Wolf!"

"And this wolf is at the celestial-grade realm! Isn't the maximum for Howling Moon Wolves only the Dao-stage? And that tuft of golden fur beneath its neck—wasn't that the mark of a Howling Moon Wolf King!" Sun Luoshan and his companions, along with others, stared at the Howling Moon Wolf King in sheer terror.

"Seal Soul!" Luo Tian seemed to ignore their pleas. He waved his hands, then took out a token, etching gray mist onto it.

"Before departing, I gift this to Lord Long!" Luo Tian waved his hand, sending the token toward Long Li.

Long Li accepted the token and immediately felt a shock. Upon its contact, he sensed that Sun Luoshan's lives were now in his grasp. With a single incantation, he could annihilate them.

Chapter 1781: Striving for Heaven ()

"Three of you, are you still going to stay here?" Long Li smiled as he gazed at Zhang Lie and the others. Now that their lives were in his hands, the Five Cities would be under his control. Luo Tian's gift was immense, giving Long Li a sense of fortune falling from the sky.

"We'll take our leave then!" Sun Luoshan, Zhang Feng, and Zhang Lie bore bitter expressions. Their regret was profound; they hadn't gained control of the Dragon-Embracing City but had instead entangled themselves.

They respectfully glanced at Luo Tian, who now seemed a demon to them. With his supernatural abilities and people, they left Dragon Singing City in haste.

"Are you leaving?" Long You Ran asked Luo Tian, her gaze filled with a hint of sorrow. She had enjoyed her time with him.

"Yes... it's time to go," Luo Tian nodded. Knowing the Heavenly Origin Sect had been destroyed, he understood that without sufficient strength, establishing a sect was futile.

"Brother Luo, would you like to visit our city's residence?" Long Li invited him. He knew these Five Cities couldn't hold Luo Tian; he needed broader horizons.

"Alright..." Luo Tian nodded. He had no specific destination, just wandering to see if he could meet old friends.

With the people's respectful gazes, Luo Tian, Long Li, and Long You Ran entered a lavish reception hall in the city's residence.

"Feast!" Luo Tian ordered the attendants, then sat down. Long You Ran stood behind Long Li.

"Brother Luo, do you have a destination?" As soon as Long Li sat down, he chatted with Luo Tian.

"I'll wander around. Perhaps I can find my friends," Luo Tian replied softly, explaining his plan.

"Have you considered joining the Heavenly Dragon Sect?" Hearing Luo Tian's lack of direction, Long Li asked.

"The Heavenly Dragon Sect is one of the three sects in the Lower Heavens. It's relatively close to Dragon Singing City. Moreover, the Heavenly Struggle Competition is about to begin. The Heavenly Dragon Sect might even enter the Middle Heavens! The spiritual energy in the Middle Heavens is far denser than that of the Lower Heavens. Brother Luo's talent would easily qualify him for the Heavenly Dragon Sect!" Long Li explained, causing Luo Tian to frown slightly.

As for the Heavenly Dragon Sect, Luo Tian hadn't ruled it out. However, thinking of Zhu Fengtian within the sect, if he truly joined, there would be considerable trouble. Though his strength in the Heavens was decent, he still had no say against such a major sect.

"Don't worry, Brother Luo. In the Heavenly Dragon Sect, those with higher cultivation would never attack those of lower rank!"

"Moreover, I have a relative who's also a disciple. He seems quite capable there. Perhaps he could assist you!"

"Besides, Brother Luo has now offended Yao Qishui and Li Haoran. They'll surely seek revenge. In the Lower Heavens, no sect would accept you except for the three major ones!" Long Li continued to weigh the pros and cons.

"What relative? A distant cousin! Don't be so optimistic, Father!" Long You Ran rolled her eyes, clearly dismissing the relative.

"The Heavenly Dragon Sect? It's a good choice. Perhaps someone there might have entered it!" Luo Tian mused, considering various possibilities.

"I'll check it out first. Who knows if they won't accept me!" Luo Tian's eyes glinted with a smile, nodding.

"Really?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Long You Ran and Long Li's eyes lit up. For Long You Ran, it was a companion on the journey; for Long Li, it meant safety with a celestial-grade protector.

"What exactly is this Heavenly Struggle Competition?" Then Luo Tian inquired about the competition Long Li had mentioned.

"The Heavenly Struggle Competition is a contest for entry into the Middle Heavens. It happens every thousand years. Only one sect from the Lower Heavens is eligible to compete. If successful, it would break free of the Lower Heavens and enter the Middle Heavens!"

"This competition is crucial for sects in the Lower Heavens. However, everyone knows that only one of the three major sects can truly compete!"

"The Heavenly Struggle Competition is extremely brutal. If one fails, it won't be as severe as destruction, but it would still suffer great losses. After two failures, the current three sects were formed. The failed sects fell into obscurity and became minor sects."

"Is there any other way to enter the Middle Heavens?" Luo Tian asked. He didn't want to stay in the Lower Heavens forever.

"Of course, breaking through into the Celestial Stage would allow one to breach the spatial barrier between the Lower and Middle Heavens, entering the Middle Heavens. That's why Celestial Stage disciples are so rare in the Lower Heavens," Long Li replied softly. These details were only hearsay; Dragon Singing City was just an insignificant city in the Lower Heavens. There were many cities like it.

"There's half a year until the Heavenly Dragon Sect begins recruiting disciples. You still have ample time!" Long Li addressed Luo Tian.

"Better to act quickly, for delays can bring trouble. Moreover, Yao Qishui and Li Haoran might seek trouble. They could even involve Master Long!" Luo Tian's gaze showed concern. Yao Qishui and Li Haoran were always a threat, especially since Yao Qishui held a high position in the Chaos Sect.

"It should be fine. I'm just an acquaintance of yours. Yao Qishui doesn't know how close we are!" Long Li shook his head. Luo Tian's meaning was clear—that he should hide for a while. However, Long Li couldn't bear to leave his years of hard-earned Dragon Singing City. Now that he controlled the Five Cities, it was time to expand his ambitions.

"If trouble arises, you can hide in the Endless Forest!" Luo Tian extended a hand, sending a streak of green mist from it. It formed an imprint on Long Li's forehead. With this mark, the Howling Moon Wolves in the Endless Forest would not attack Long Li.

"Alright. Stay for two days. Let me know when you're leaving, and please take care of You Ran on the journey!" Long Li nodded, gazing at Long You Ran with affection. She was his only daughter; he couldn't risk anything happening to her.

"This girl is just mischievous, but she won't cause trouble!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly and agreed.

"Ugh, you're still young but already act so old!" Hearing Luo Tian's tone, Long You Ran was unamused.

"I'm a thousand-year-old monster. In terms of age, I'm even older than your father!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed Long You Ran.

"Brother Luo speaks in jest. Come, let's eat!" Long Li laughed and didn't take Luo Tian's words seriously, leading him to dine.

During the banquet, Long Li and Luo Tian chatted further. Luo Tian learned about the current state of the Heavens, which Long Li knew more than Long You Ran.

At night, Luo Tian sat cross-legged in the room prepared for him by Long Li. His fingers rhythmically tapped on the bedpost.

"Midnight has come..." He stopped tapping, his face showing joy. His body emitted a series of humming sounds, and the Soul-Controlling Seal in his mind gradually appeared.

"Midnight is when the Yin energy in the world is strongest!" Luo Tian murmured, then closed his eyes to sense it.

The entire Dragon Singing City fell into silence. A silver moon hung in the sky, illuminating the city.

Gradually, a gust of wind passed by. Simultaneously, a series of howls echoed through the world. However, the people in Dragon Singing City didn't hear it—only Luo Tian could.

Black mist rose from the ground of Dragon Singing City, forming a dark cloud that enveloped it. The silver moon was obscured, plunging the city into darkness.

"Such a cold chill!" Long Li, who had just decided to rest, suddenly opened his eyes. He felt a cold atmosphere in his perception and hurriedly stepped out of the room, then saw endless darkness.

Alongside Long Li was Long You Ran and Zheng Tiande. Their eyes showed confusion as they gazed at the city now engulfed in endless darkness.

"Such a cold chill... husband, hold me!"

"It's really cold. Is it winter already?" Meanwhile, the people of Dragon Singing City shivered but dismissed it as nothing.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian was enveloped in black mist, his body radiating a sinister aura.

"Indeed, there's ghost energy..." Luo Tian was shocked. He felt the black mist he had cultivated—another kind of soul, not a residual soul but with a similar form.

"Regardless of what it is, it's something I've cultivated through the Soul-Controlling Seal!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, then began fervently refining the black mist. The flickering Soul-Controlling Seal in his mind gradually solidified.

As Luo Tian continued refining the black mist, a dark shadow obscured the moon. It gradually coalesced into a human form, its eyes cold and focused on Luo Tian's room. It then flew toward his direction.

However, at the moment the shadow moved, time gradually reached the hour of Chou. The shadow suddenly halted, its eyes showing decisiveness. It spat out a wisp of black mist into Luo Tian's room before vanishing into the sky.

The silver moon reappeared over Dragon Singing City, and Luo Tian had completely refined the last traces of mist.

Chapter 1782: Heavenly Dragon Sect Disciple ()

"Time was short. I could only refine the Soul-Controlling Seal for an hour!" Luo Tian sighed softly. He had no idea about the outside situation; he had spent the entire hour refining the seal. Though his progress was considerable, he guessed it would take at least half a year to refine the Soul-Controlling Seal to its initial stage.

"Then I'll have Xiaoqing help with the Beast-Controlling Seal during noon!" Luo Tian spoke softly, then opened the轮回天功 (Reincarnation Heaven Art) again for his daily cultivation.

Time flowed slowly. The night passed quickly, and Luo Tian opened his eyes. He stepped out of the room to find three weary figures—Long Li, Long You Ran, and Zheng Tiande—who had noticed something was wrong the previous night.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing Luo Tian emerge, they immediately surrounded him, their eyes scanning his body.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian looked puzzled at their expressions. Clearly, they had been guarding his room all night.

"What did you do last night?" Long You Ran stared at Luo Tian with wide eyes, then recounted the events of the previous night.

"Uh..." Hearing Long You Ran's words, Luo Tian rubbed his nose and addressed them: "I was refining a technique. It required the midnight hour!"

"Be careful, you know. Last night, we saw a dark shadow in the sky. Its aura frightened us!"

"That shadow rushed toward your room, but for some reason, it just spat out a breath of mist before disappearing!" Long You Ran warned Luo Tian, her voice filled with concern. The dark shadow had left a deep impression on her.

"Are you a ghost cultivator?" Then Long You Ran scrutinized Luo Tian again, her eyes filled with doubt.

"What's a ghost cultivator?" Hearing Long You Ran's words, Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He didn't know what a ghost cultivator was.

"You don't know about ghost cultivators?" Long Li and the others looked at Luo Tian, feeling he wasn't a celestial-grade powerhouse but rather a novice. Such people were either disciples of some hidden old monster or newly ascended to the Heavens.

However, they didn't consider Luo Tian as someone who had ascended from the Three Thousand Small Worlds. After all, such people were rare; Dragon Singing City, a small place, wouldn't have one. Moreover, those who ascended from the Three Thousand Small Worlds would arrive at the Flying Immortal Platform. The platform was controlled by the three major sects, and anyone who ascended would be taken in by them.

"I won't hide it. I'm not from the Heavens but from the Three Thousand Small Worlds," Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Long You Ran and the others.

"What!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Long Li, Long You Ran, and Zheng Tiande widened their eyes in shock.

"You... you... are you an ascended one?" Long You Ran seemed to have not heard clearly and asked again.

"Indeed. My hometown is called the Nine Domains of Yuan," Luo Tian nodded, unsure why they reacted so strongly.

"Ah! That's why you were much stronger at the Heavenly Dao Stage than us!" Seeing Luo Tian's gaze, Long Li and the others knew he wasn't lying.

"Of course! You said you were two or three thousand years old, and I always felt a strange maturity about you!" Long Li's face showed realization as he scrutinized Luo Tian again.

"So that's what an ascended one looks like! Tell me, is Nine Domains fun?" Long You Ran was curious and scrutinized Luo Tian again. After finding he wasn't different from them, she lost interest.

"It's beautiful..." Mentioning Nine Domains stirred strong memories in Luo Tian, his gaze softening.

"Never tell anyone you're an ascended one!" Long Li gazed at Luo Tian, his expression grave.

"Uh?" Hearing Long Li's words, Luo Tian's heart tightened. His eyes showed inquiry as he addressed Long Li: "Please, Elder, explain clearly!"

"The entire Heavens are searching for ascended ones. I heard that the Nine Immortal Mountains issued a notice, but I don't know who sent it. However, sects in the Lower Heavens have already started moving. After all, it's a command from the Nine Immortal Mountains!"

"Although I don't know why the Nine Immortal Mountains are doing this, there must be a reason. However, I don't think it's anything good. Ascended ones are strong and talented but not yet worthy of the Immortal Kings' attention!" Long Li spoke, sharing what he knew with Luo Tian.

"Clunk..." Hearing Long Li's words, Luo Tian's heart sank. A bad premonition arose.

"Is it the Eternal Immortal King? Has my master been discovered?" Luo Tian murmured, worrying about his friends.

"This will be kept secret. As long as you don't say it, no one will know you're an ascended one!" Long Li continued, not saying much more.

"Thank you, Elder!" Luo Tian's eyes showed gratitude. The rewards from the Immortal King's command must be astonishing. Long Li keeping his secret was a huge temptation.

"Are you leaving today?" Then Long Li asked again, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Yes. I'll leave shortly!" Luo Tian's mind was in chaos. He urgently wanted to know about his relatives and friends who had ascended with him. If they were captured by the sects or sent to the Eternal Immortal King, it would be a huge trouble. The best place to gather information was the Heavenly Dragon Sect.

"Then we'll prepare. Once ready, you can leave!" Long Li said, signaling Long You Ran and Zheng Tiande to leave.

"Buzz..." As the three were about to turn, two long streaks of light flashed past and appeared over Dragon Singing City's city hall. Two young men in white robes stood high above, their faces full of arrogance. On the right sleeves of their white robes was a lifelike dragon, clearly visible.

"Another celestial-grade!"

"And two of them!" The people of Dragon Singing City immediately saw the two young men in the sky and gasped.

"Look at their sleeves' embroidery! Two dragons. That symbol is familiar!" People then noticed the two young men's embroidered sleeves, their eyes showing confusion.

"That's... the Heavenly Dragon Sect's mark!" After a moment of panic, someone finally recognized the two young men and the crowd erupted.

"Such young celestial-grade disciples! No wonder they're from the Heavenly Dragon Sect!"

"But why are the Heavenly Dragon Sect's disciples coming to our Dragon Singing City?" People whispered among themselves, gazing at the two young men in the sky with reverence.

"Who is the city's lord?" One of the young men spoke, looking down at Luo Tian and the others with a superior gaze. His eyes flickered slightly but only for an instant.

"I am!" Long Li quickly replied. The Heavenly Dragon Sect was a colossal entity to them; even ordinary disciples were beyond his reach.

"The Heavenly Dragon Sect's order: anyone who discovers an ascended one must report to us!" The young man spoke loudly, his voice carrying authority.

"They've come!" Hearing the young man's words, Luo Tian and the others exchanged glances. Long Li then spoke loudly: "Dragon Singing City's Lord Long Li acknowledges the Heavenly Dragon Sect's order!"

"Ah!" The two young men slowly descended. They scanned Luo Tian, then their gazes shifted to Long You Ran.

"We've traveled far and are a bit hungry. Prepare us some banquet!" The two young men spoke again, directing their gaze toward Long Li.

"Disgusting!" Hearing the young men's words, Long Li inwardly cursed. At the celestial-grade level, they still felt hunger? A ghost would believe it. This was a blatant demand for gifts.

"Please wait a moment. I'll have the steward prepare something for you!" Long Li, though inwardly cursing, signaled Zheng Tiande with a glance. Zheng Tiande understood and left.

"Who is this?" One of the young men shifted his gaze to Long You Ran, asking.

"This is my beloved daughter!" Long Li was displeased but smiled politely at the young man.

"Dear Sister, I am Lu Potian, an outer sect disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Sect. This journey has two tasks: one is to find ascended ones, and the other is if we encounter promising disciples, we can recommend them into the outer sect of the Heavenly Dragon Sect. Dear Sister, would you like to join the Heavenly Dragon Sect's outer sect? I can recommend you!" Lu Potian smiled and addressed Long You Ran.

"What?" Hearing Lu Potian's words, Long Li and Long You Ran were stunned. A chance to ascend directly into the Heavenly Dragon Sect was rare, and for Long You Ran, it was an opportunity to rise swiftly. Though confident, she wasn't sure if she could pass the trial.

"Two of you, what conditions do you have? I will spend everything to meet your demands!" Long Li spoke loudly. If Long You Ran could enter the Heavenly Dragon Sect, her future would be bright.

"Lord Long's daughter has excellent talent. At such an age, she's already at the Heavenly Dao Stage. She qualifies. Of course, I need some gifts to smooth things over. So Lord Long must spend a bit!" Lu Potian addressed Long Li.

"Can we recommend two people together?" At this moment, Long You Ran spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

"This..." Lu Potian's expression paused. He glanced at the other young man, then said: "Each of us has only one spot. The second will depend on whether my fellow disciple, Xu Hongtao, is willing!"

As he spoke, Lu Potian exchanged glances with the other young man named Xu.

Chapter 1783: Earth Dragon Gate Elder ()

"This isn't good," the other young man, Xu Hongtao, looked troubled. His brows furrowed slightly.

"Here, this is a token of my respect!" Seeing Xu Hongtao's troubled expression, Long Li smiled and took the storage ring from Zheng Tiande. He then handed it to Lu Potian.

"This..." Lu Potian's face also showed hesitation, but Luo Tian saw flashes of light in his eyes.

"Xu Brother, let's add one more!" Lu Potian smiled at his companion.

"Alright. Since you said it, I'll reluctantly recommend him!" Xu Hongtao nodded.

"Thank you both!" Hearing their words, Long Li's eyes showed great joy. He hadn't expected so much good fortune recently.

"Wait..." But as Lu Potian was about to speak again, a cold voice echoed in everyone's ears. Luo Tian stepped forward toward Lu Potian and waved his hand, retrieving the storage ring Lu Potian hadn't yet hidden.

"Thank you both for your kindness. We'd rather go on our own!" Luo Tian spoke softly, then felt the treasures inside the storage ring—none were ordinary. He sighed inwardly; Long Li had truly sold everything to get his daughter and himself into the Heavenly Dragon Sect.

"What?" Seeing Luo Tian take back the storage ring from his hand, Lu Potian's face changed slightly.

Long Li, Long You Ran, and Zheng Tiande's expressions also shifted. Their eyes showed confusion as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, what are you doing?" Long Li asked, his gaze shifting to Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao's faces, which gradually darkened with blame.

"This is my nephew. He's from a remote place. His talent is good, but he's quite arrogant..." Long Li took the storage ring from Luo Tian and tried to give it back to Lu Potian.

"Oh... alright. We won't hold it against him!" Lu Potian smiled again upon seeing the storage ring.

"Uncle, you should take it back!" This time, before Lu Potian could reach for it, Luo Tian stood in front of Long Li. His eyes still carried a smile as he addressed Long Li.

"Hmm?" Seeing Luo Tian's gaze, Long Li felt a slight tension. He then fell silent and said nothing.

Though Luo Tian had only arrived in the Heavens for a short time, his experience was comparable to that of some old monsters in the Heavens. At this moment, he repeatedly stopped Long Li from giving away the ring, clearly sensing something fishy.

"What are you two up to?" Lu Potian gazed at Luo Tian, his face finally darkening. His aura gradually rose.

"Nothing in particular. Please leave now. If we encounter an ascended one, we'll report it!" Luo Tian smiled and replied.

"You don't need to say it. I know what's on your minds!"

"I don't know how many people you've tricked along the way, but don't bring your tricks here to Dragon Singing City!" Luo Tian didn't wait for their response and continued.

"You're giving us face, but we don't want it. Do you really want me to turn hostile?" Lu Potian sneered, his aura rising. Xu Hongtao's face was also cold.

They had tricked many people on their mission, and they were just minor disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Sect. They had no authority to recommend others into the sect.

They first pretended they could recommend people into the Heavenly Dragon Sect, making city lords offer a lot of treasures. Then, they killed those people on the way. Two celestial-grade disciples could easily kill a Heavenly Dao Stage disciple.

They had originally planned to take Long You Ran away. After all, Luo Tian was a celestial-grade disciple; killing him would be difficult. Moreover, Long You Ran's beauty was appealing. They had planned to enjoy her and take most of Dragon Singing City's wealth.

Now, Luo Tian had seen through their intentions. Their faces were slightly troubled. Since they had been discovered, they couldn't take Long You Ran away. But the two storage rings Long Li had just given them, they still wanted to take.

"Hand over those two storage rings. We won't hold it against you. As for recommending your entry into the sect, don't mention it again!" Lu Potian spoke coldly, feigning anger.

"This is your way of acting!" Seeing Lu Potian's demeanor, Luo Tian couldn't hold back and muttered under his breath.

"Lu Potian, are you single? Or do you call yourself 'Suck-Blade' instead of 'Suck'? You suck too much, your brain isn't working!" Luo Tian sneered and mocked.

"Cough cough..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, except for Long You Ran, even Long Li and Zheng Tiande, as well as Xu Hongtao, couldn't hold back.

Especially Xu Hongtao. He knew Lu Potian had some fame in the Heavenly Dragon Sect, but not for his strength. It was because of his name. Many people in the Heavenly Dragon Sect called Lu Potian 'Suck-Blade'.

The reason for Lu Potian's fame was that he once engaged in a high-energy activity and was caught by another disciple. From then on, 'Suck-Blade' became a nickname in the Heavenly Dragon Sect, and Lu Potian became a laughingstock.

"You're asking for death!" Lu Potian clearly felt that Luo Tian had hit his weakness, and his eyes flashed with murderous intent.

"The Heavenly Dragon Sect is such a bunch of scum. Honestly, there's no need to enter it!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly. From Zhu Fengtian, Xue Sha, to now Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao, his impression of the Heavenly Dragon Sect had deteriorated to the extreme.

"Roar..." A dragon's roar rose from Lu Potian. Then, a golden long dragon shot out from his hand, roaring and overturning the ground as it rushed toward Luo Tian.

"What..." Seeing Lu Potian's rage, Long Li and the others were stunned. They hadn't expected him to attack immediately.

"Roar..." A moment later, a low roar echoed in Luo Tian's courtyard. A black demon moon instantly flew out and collided with the golden long dragon Lu Potian had summoned.

"Indeed, he has an ally!" Lu Potian's eyes slightly changed. He hadn't moved at all, and Luo Tian had been mocking him the entire time.

"Xu Brother, help me eliminate this kid! He's insulting our Heavenly Dragon Sect!" Lu Potian addressed Xu Hongtao, clearly indicating he should block Luo Tian's ally. Then his body rushed toward Luo Tian. In Xu Hongtao's view, eliminating this mountain wildling was a matter of seconds. After all, he was an outer sect disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Sect.

But Xu Hongtao didn't know that this kid had dared to kill even the renowned Xue Sha of the Heavenly Dragon Sect. If he knew, Lu Potian would never have made such a foolish move. Though he had some fame, he was still far behind Xue Sha.

"Looks like it's time for a fight!" Luo Tian sneered and then kicked off the ground. Lu Potian had given him a decent feeling, but it was only good.

"The Heavenly Dragon Sect is really domineering!" As Luo Tian prepared to teach these two disciples a lesson, a loud laugh echoed. It made Luo Tian stop.

A powerful pressure came from the sky. A light spot appeared in the sky and instantly arrived there.

"An expert!" At the moment this light spot appeared, Luo Tian's heart slightly tensed. An irresistible pressure made his body instinctively tense.

A senior in gray robes descended from the sky, with gray hair and beard. His entire figure was ethereal and ancient, his eyes glowing with intense light. A silver long dragon was imprinted on the sleeve of his robe.

"Earth Dragon Gate Elder, Zhao Tiancheng!" At the moment this elder appeared, Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao's faces slightly changed.

"Wow! That old man is from the Earth Dragon Gate. He just arrived at the Heavenly Dragon Sect, and now he's here!" The people of Dragon Singing City were instantly shocked. They gazed at the elder descending from the sky.

Zhao Tiancheng, a senior with late-stage celestial-grade strength. He was an elder of the Earth Dragon Gate and held high status within it. Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao hadn't expected to meet this renowned elder in the Lower Heavens. Why had Zhao Tiancheng come to this desolate Dragon Singing City?

"Little friend, I am Zhao Tiancheng of the Earth Dragon Gate. Do you have any interest in joining the Earth Dragon Gate?" Zhao Tiancheng landed and didn't even glance at Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao. He directly gazed at Luo Tian.

"What's going on!" Hearing Zhao Tiancheng's words, Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao were stunned. They widened their eyes, gazing at Luo Tian.

Long Li, Long You Ran, and Zheng Tiande were also stunned. This person, who they considered a great figure, had immediately tried to recruit Luo Tian into the Earth Dragon Gate.

Even Luo Tian was stunned. He didn't know who this terrifying old man was or where he had seen Zhao Tiancheng before.

"An Earth Dragon Gate elder, personally recruiting this poor backwater kid into the Earth Dragon Gate!" Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao were shocked. They looked at Luo Tian but saw no difference in him.

"I can let you enter the sect immediately as an inner disciple. I have no ill intentions toward this little brother!" Zhao Tiancheng, hearing Luo Tian's words, didn't show the slightest anger. Instead, his eyes showed admiration and continued to speak to Luo Tian, leaving Luo Tian confused.

Chapter 1784: To Go or Not to Go
