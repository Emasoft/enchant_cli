“Try it!” Xiu He and Tian Luo's eyes locked onto the old man. Both were now weakened, facing an Immortal King in his late stage—this would be a grueling battle.

“Then die!” The late-stage Immortal King sneered, raising his hand to strike. A massive black palm descended from the sky, crushing toward Xiu He and Tian Luo.

“Looks like I won’t see Luotian’s final glance,” Tian Luo sighed. He knew Luotian would return, but they wouldn’t last long enough.

Earlier, Xiu He had taken the old man’s furious palm strike at death’s door, nearly crushed to death. Tian Luo fared no better; the late-stage Immortal King’s full power was beyond their ability to withstand head-on.

“I wish I’d never seen him,” Xiu Luo rarely smiled, his grin chilling.

“You’re better off not smiling. Only Luotian could make you smile,” the two stood there, chatting idly. As they spoke, the palm reached their heads, wind blasting against them, flapping their robes.

*Boom boom boom...*

At the same time, Xiu He and Tian Luo’s auras surged violently. They swung their fists toward the descending palm.

“Hmph, what secret technique is this?” The late-stage Immortal King’s face shifted. He struck again, attacking Xiu He and Tian Luo.

The battlefield stabilized once more. With the late-stage Immortal King’s threat gone, Tianyuan Sect disciples fought desperately to repel Hell’s assault—only managing to hold it back. The two late-stage Immortal Kings had already torn a hole, allowing countless Hell forces to storm Tianyuan Mountain, slaughtering the weak and infirm.

Numerous Tianyuan Sect disciples rushed to stop them, worsening their already dire situation. The breakthrough was merely a matter of time.

As time passed, another grave issue arose: Fire Lord Meng Wushuang could no longer endure. He stood in the sky, swaying unsteadily.

“End!” Five late-stage Immortal Kings moved their hands, unleashing five martial techniques toward Fire Lord Meng.

Fire Lord Meng roared, his fiery aura enveloping him to block four of the techniques. *Boom boom...*

The flames shattered, and Fire Lord Meng was struck by the residual force of four techniques, falling from the sky.

The five late-stage Immortal Kings moved their hands again, binding Fire Lord Meng with rune chains. They tossed him behind the Hell army.

With their hands free, the five late-stage Immortal Kings strode toward the clash between Tianyuan Sect and Hell’s forces, their overwhelming pressure rendering Tianyuan Sect elders and disciples powerless.

“Done…” All of Tianyuan Sect felt despair. Five late-stage Immortal Kings could annihilate their current sect.

“Damn, I’m too late!” As the five late-stage Immortal Kings took their first steps to end the battle, a curse echoed. Three figures flew from afar.

*Buzz...*

From another direction, a crimson blade slashed toward the five late-stage Immortal Kings.

The figures appeared instantly on the battlefield, causing Jiang Sixi and others to smile with relief.

“Sun Kelnian, you bastard! Why are you so late?” Diao Dezhu cursed, his body darting as a Saint Prince and an Immortal King in the middle stage pursued him.

“Shu Feiyang!”

“Shu Saint Fei!” To everyone’s surprise, another two figures arrived—Shu Feiyang had also come. This left people stunned.

“Luo Tian, you’ve cursed me! I knew meeting you would bring misfortune!” Shu Feiyang smiled bitterly, watching the chaotic battlefield. Though his words were reluctant, his speed was swift as he rushed toward a late-stage Immortal King.

“Kid, you take three, I’ll handle one!” Zhang Chenglong called to Shu Saint Fei, darting to block two late-stage Immortal Kings.

Chapter 2713: Return

With Zhang Chenglong, Shu Feiyang, and Shu Saint Fei joining the fight, Tianyuan Sect’s situation remained dire.

Blood flowed endlessly from Tianyuan Mountain, corpses littered the land. After a day of battle, only three million disciples remained in Tianyuan Sect.

Though Hell also suffered losses, their elite forces were far superior. They had only lost over a million, compared to Tianyuan Sect’s fourfold ratio.

The sky battlefield was no better. Zhang Chenglong fought two opponents, managing to hold his ground but still under pressure.

Shu Feiyang and Shu Saint Fei were also constrained. They had only recently entered the late-stage Immortal King realm, their cultivation unstable, yet they arrived at Tianyuan Sect.

“Battle Master Brother, Meng Xue Sister, take care of the master!” A shout echoed as two figures were pierced by Cheng Ping. Their corpses fell from the sky. Lu Chong’s disciples, Lu Jiushan and Lu Xinshui, left their final words before falling to the ground.

“Roar…” Chen Zhanbiao roared, his cries like a wounded beast. But he was bloodied by an Immortal King in the late stage and Yin Wu.

Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes burned crimson. He knew who was kind to him—these two senior brothers were introverted but had always treated Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue kindly, like half-parents.

“Ah…” Meng Xue screamed, slicing her opponent in half with the Dragon Abyss Heavy Sword. She lost an arm in return.

Killing a mid-stage Immortal King, Meng Xue didn’t hesitate. She soared toward Chen Zhanbiao’s direction. She knew his pressure was unbearable, and he had held on solely through his monstrous physique.

“Tough opponent!” Ye Qiu’s face darkened, watching Long Jie’s frenzied attack. He wielded the Absolute Cloud Sword to break through the surging dragon breath.

*Plop…* Lu Chong watched his two beloved disciples die, spitting blood. His hammer struck with a trail of残影, as if countless thunderbolts were unleashed, colliding with the Immortal King in the late stage. *Boom...*

Lu Chong’s body flew backward, his face pale with weakness. A black cold-aura spear appeared behind him. A blood hole formed on his shoulder as he barely managed to concentrate his cultivation, blocking the attack.

But the spear still pierced his shoulder, leaving a blood hole. Lu Chong’s body lost balance.

A massive black hand appeared in Lu Chong’s vision, crushing down on him. *Smack…*

The crisp sound echoed as Lu Chong’s body shot like a meteor into the ground. Dust rose, revealing a deep pit. The late-stage Immortal King’s eyes gleamed with killing intent, panting heavily before finally binding Lu Chong with runes.

As Cheng Ping and the late-stage Immortal King regained their hands, balance was shattered again. Meanwhile, Hell’s elite forces tore another hole in Tianyuan Mountain, countless yellow-robed figures rushing into it.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!” They raised their blades instantly, targeting Tianyuan Sect’s elderly and infirm.

The momentum was unstoppable; the inner halls of Tianyuan Sect erupted with cries. Each elderly and infirm person died beneath the blades.

“Beasts!” Diao Dezhu cursed, stunned they would attack even the weak and infirm.

Tianyuan Sect’s breach widened, Hell forces surged in. Facing the wolf-like Hell army, Tianyuan Sect’s people were utterly despairing.

“Why!” Desperate roars echoed as Tianyuan Sect disciples felt powerless. Against the formidable阎罗十殿, their achievements were already miraculous.

At the same time, the late-stage Immortal King descended from the sky. His gaze fell upon Tianyuan Sect’s defeat, devoid of mercy.

“I’ll see who remains!” The old man strode forward, each step killing countless Tianyuan Sect disciples.

Jiang Sixi and Long Jie were frenzied, but their opponents were equally strong—most fought one-on-two or even one-on-three. They were entangled and faced death at any moment.

“Nice woman, I’ll take her!” Soldiers roared. Now was the time to seize women, treasures, and resources—what one grabbed belonged to them.

As Tianyuan Sect’s people despaired, two streaks of light flew beyond five hundred miles. Even from afar, they could hear the deafening cries and the sky shattering.

“It’s begun!” Their hearts skipped a beat. Without hesitation, they sped toward Tianyuan Sect.

The two were Luo Tian and Yao Chen. They had rushed as fast as possible, but still missed the battle’s start five hundred miles away. For Luo Tian and Yao Chen, it wasn’t too far; they reached the outskirts of Tianyuan Sect in a few breaths.

“Someone actually came!” Late-stage Immortal Kings smiled upon seeing the two. Upon spotting Luo Tian, one of them slightly hesitated.

“Luo Tian!” The battlefield stilled—Luo Tian was too famous.

“How did he return!”

“Luo Tian, run!” Shouts echoed as Diao Dezhu and others looked at Luo Tian. They didn’t want anyone to bury them.

Luo Tian gazed at the ruined Tianyuan Mountain, seeing Jiang Sixi, Long Jie, and Diao Dezhu in peril. His eyes instantly turned blood-red.

“Die!”

“Ahh…” Luo Tian roared, drawing the Rupture Spear. Without hesitation, he rushed toward the late-stage Immortal King.

Yao Chen was also furious, her aura surging. Her golden staff swept down toward the late-stage Immortal King battling Xiu He and Tian Luo.

“Why did you come back? Run! You think you’re a king returning!” Diao Dezhu and others shouted. They knew Luo Tian’s return was futile, but they also knew he wouldn’t leave.

With his Demon Cloud Wings spread and the Yellow River Step activated, Luo Tian flashed before the old man. His black spear pierced through him.

“Damn!” The old man’s face shifted, surprised by Luo Tian’s speed. Yet he instinctively reacted, stepping on the ground.

The Rupture Spear pierced through the old man’s arm, halting his body mid-air.

“Die! All of you—none shall escape!” Luo Tian roared, six轮回 combined with the Wild Wind Punch. His fists smashed into the old man’s body.

Chapter 2714: Stabilize

*Crack…* A crisp sound echoed from the old man. Luo Tian’s furious punch, combined with six轮回 and Wild Wind Punch, was overwhelming for a late-stage Immortal King.

The old man’s body transformed into a streak of light, flying backward and colliding with countless Hell forces. All were turned to blood mist.

The late-stage Immortal King flew nearly ten thousand feet before landing awkwardly on the ground, dust swirling.

A mouthful of blood spewed out. The old man’s face was pale, six blood holes on his body, blood scattering widely.

Luo Tian moved like a ghost—no one could stop him. He stepped through the void, instantly appearing before the old man and delivering another punch.

One punch… three punches… Luo Tian was frenzied, each strike landing solidly. Blood and flesh flew as the old man turned into a pile of meat, which Luo Tian continued to crush.

The earth trembled. A deep pit formed. Hell forces around were trembling, watching Luo Tian.

“Late-stage Immortal King—killed by brute force!” Everyone felt a bad premonition. Never before had they seen such brutality.

“Everyone dies! None shall escape!” Luo Tian roared, his face smeared with blood. He gazed at the sky battlefield.

“Leave them to me! You all hold them back!” Luo Tian shouted, stepping on the ground and flying toward Zhang Chenglong.

The two old men fighting Zhang Chenglong immediately felt pressure, a torrent of resentment instantly surrounding them.

“Kid, can you do it?” Zhang Chenglong asked Luo Tian, who was nearly疯狂.

“Rest assured!” Luo Tian nodded. He instantly appeared before a late-stage Immortal King, delivering another punch.

Luo Tian showed no fear. One punch was earth-shattering, making the late-stage Immortal King’s face pale.

“Ahh…” The late-stage Immortal King wasn’t a pushover. He punched back, their fists colliding with thunderous echoes.

Yet the late-stage Immortal King was sent flying like a kite, while Luo Tian only took two steps back. His Demon Cloud Wings fluttered slightly, stabilizing his stance. He stepped on the ground and rushed toward another late-stage Immortal King, fully taking over Zhang Chenglong’s opponents.

Mid-flight, Luo Tian’s body suddenly expanded. His aura surged overwhelmingly. Without hesitation, he stomped toward the late-stage Immortal King.

“Fury of the Barbarian God—Crushing Nine Heavens!”

“Barbarian God’s Second Stomp—Shattering Stars!” Seven steps followed, Luo Tian showing no pause. His leg shadows overwhelmed the late-stage Immortal King.

The old man quickly reacted, summoning black suns from his hands to counter Luo Tian’s descending foot. *Boom boom boom boom boom boom...*

Seven explosions echoed, violent shockwaves sweeping the area. The late-stage Immortal King plummeted from the sky, crashing into the ground.

“Strong!” People’s faces showed awe as they watched Luo Tian’s fearless display.

“Leave it to you!” Zhang Chenglong’s lips twitched, flying toward Shu Saint Fei.

“I said go down and kill those Hell forces!” But as Zhang Chenglong moved, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his ears. Two waves of destruction light swept past him, causing cold sweat to form on his forehead.

“What the hell!” Zhang Chenglong was stunned. Even he felt a powerful threat, sensing that touching it would mean death or severe injury.

Two divine lights cut through the sky, instantly appearing before the two late-stage Immortal Kings fighting Shu Saint Fei.

“Damn!” Their faces darkened. The destruction light’s speed was too fast, leaving them no time to react.

*Plop plop…* Two divine lights pierced through their shoulders and legs, leaving them in pain. They caught their breath, secretly grateful they hadn’t hit vital points; otherwise, they would be dead.

“Go! Leave it to me!” Luo Tian addressed Shu Saint Fei, his voice carrying gratitude.

“Be careful!” Shu Saint Fei nodded. He knew Luo Tian wanted him and Zhang Chenglong to stop those who had entered Tianyuan Mountain. It was too tragic—elders and infirm were captured or killed, losses mounting rapidly.

Continuing this way, even if they won, Tianyuan Sect’s remaining people would be devastated, their minds affected. Zhang Chenglong and Shu Saint Fei rushed into Tianyuan Mountain and observed the battlefield, stepping toward Chen Zhanbiao.

At this moment, Chen Zhanbiao was pitiful—bloodied and wounded. Meng Xue was the same. Two Saint Princes and a late-stage Immortal King pressed heavily on them. If not rescued, they would be killed eventually.

Yao Chen also blocked two late-stage Immortal Kings. Seven late-stage Immortal Kings were all assigned by Luo Tian, Yao Chen, and Shu Saint Fei. Xiu He and Tian Luo fell from the sky.

They were truly pitiful; if not for a secret technique, they would have already been killed.

“Now it’s our turn!” Shu Feiyang gazed at the battling Saint Princes, his eyes filled with battle spirit. He showed his fangs but didn’t chase the Saint Princes, instead helping Shu Saint Fei suppress a late-stage Immortal King.

“Luo Tian has returned!” Tianyuan Sect’s people shouted, their voices filled with excitement. With Zhang Chenglong leaving the Immortal King battlefield, those who had entered Tianyuan Mountain were completely cleared by Zhang Chenglong.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Tianyuan Sect’s morale surged, unleashing superhuman combat power to repel Hell’s forces.

Zhang Chenglong emerged from Tianyuan Sect, along with Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue. Though wounded, they still had a chance against True Immortals.

“Kill!” Chen Zhanbiao transformed into a beast-like figure, bloodied and charging into Hell’s forces. He grabbed a True Immortal, snapping its neck.

Frenzied, with Chen Zhanbiao and Zhang Chenglong leading, Tianyuan Sect’s people went mad. They split into three directions, charging at Hell’s forces.

“Can’t stop them! How can we stop late-stage Immortal Kings!” Hell’s people panicked. They hadn’t expected Tianyuan Sect to turn the tide, all because of two people.

“Form a formation! Form a formation!” From the sky, several Immortals rushed down, shouting desperately.

“Yes!” Instantly, Hell’s factions began to move, retreating from Tianyuan Mountain and setting up a grand formation.

“Luo Tian, do you think you can withstand our four attacks and change everything? We still have reinforcements. The army attacking the Immortal Realm is about to arrive. How will you withstand that?” Four late-stage Immortal Kings, restrained by Luo Tian’s Annihilation Light, were exhausted. Luo Tian would unleash one or two more whenever he could.

Chapter 2715: Six Heavens and Hells

“Reinforcements?” Luo Tian’s face curled with a sneer. He raised his spear toward the speaking old man, while the Sinful Mirror unleashed three Annihilation Lights toward the other three late-stage Immortal Kings. They were preoccupied with defending against Luo Tian.

The old man was beaten relentlessly, no chance to fight back. His injuries accumulated continuously.

“You’ve killed nine of me already!”

“Don’t think about reinforcements—they’re all dealt with!” Luo Tian sneered. The Infernal Ghost Claws descended, pinning the old man to the ground. He stomped down with a massive foot.

*Boom boom boom…* The old man, powerless, spat blood repeatedly.

“Ahh…” Four late-stage Immortal Kings were exasperated. Without the Annihilation Light, they could have fought Luo Tian, even subdued him. But this light had tied up three of them.

“I’ll see how many you have!”

“And Luo Tian, look! Our formation has started!” Three late-stage Immortal Kings shouted. They were spitting blood, their eyes on the ground.

*Buzz…*

A terrifying aura rose. Hell forces around Tianyuan Mountain cried out, their overwhelming ghost qi enveloping the entire sect. The sky darkened with clouds.

Oppressive pressure made Luo Tian and others grimace. They gazed at the formation—this wasn’t just ten halls’ individual formations but a grand one formed by so many people.

The Ten Halls were connected, creating an astonishing formation crafted by the Emperor Shentu.

But since the Ten Halls ruled Hell for so long, everyone had forgotten about this grand formation. The halls weren’t harmonious, and no force could unite them to deal with it.

Cold ghost qi, overwhelming pressure. Even Zhang Chenglong’s face was grim.

The ghost qi fell like mist, clinging to Tianyuan Sect disciples. Zhang Chenglong’s body trembled but the qi seemed impossible to escape.

Millions of Hell forces began moving, their ghost qi flowing. Zhang Chenglong felt a wave affecting him.

Reincarnation!

The four late-stage Immortal Kings shouted. Hell forces all bled, forming a crimson dragon circling the ghost qi.

*Boom boom...*

As the formation activated, a roar echoed from Tianyuan Sect. A True Immortal disciple was drained of energy, his body rapidly withering.

This was just the beginning. Tianyuan Sect disciples grimaced, their bodies invaded by some force, emitting painful cries.

“Six Heavens and Hells!” Luo Tian’s face changed. His body was also infected with ghost qi, instantly recognizing this power.

Six Heavens and Hells’ force was familiar to Luo Tian. He could withstand it, but most couldn’t.

Tianyuan Sect disciples instantly cried out in pain, their bodies struggling to resist the powerful Six Heavens and Hells force.

“This formation can’t be broken!” Luo Tian and other Immortal Kings grimly said. Their opponents also retreated to the ground, personally controlling the formation.

Luo Tian and others returned to the ground, gathering together to release their domains, enveloping the entire Tianyuan Mountain.

*Crack crack...*

But as Hell forces landed on the ground and Immortal Kings joined, the Six Heavens and Hells force became stronger. Luo Tian’s domains cracked continuously.

“What do we do? They want to kill us alive with this formation!” Zhang Chenglong spoke, watching the thick ghost qi.

“They’ve gambled everything!”

“If we break this formation, Hell’s forces won’t be our problem. They opened this formation at a great cost. But your attacks can only break parts, not the whole!” The recovering Wan Lingkong weakly spoke.

“The nine statues are nine formation points, interconnected. They must be broken simultaneously to shatter this formation!”

“If I’m not mistaken, this formation has ten points. It’s because of the wheel rotation that it wasn’t completed. If there were ten, its power would be stronger!” Wan Lingkong added, precisely identifying the formation’s weakness.

“I’ll try!” Luo Tian stepped forward. Their domains would eventually break, and many Tianyuan Sect disciples were still suffering from the Six Heavens and Hells force. If domains broke, no one below Immortal King would survive.

As he spoke, Luo Tian stepped out of the formation. He gazed at the nine statues, drawing the Sinful Mirror and pouring his cultivation into it.

Nine streams of light flowed within the mirror, then suddenly burst forth toward the nine statues. Annihilation Light sliced through the thick ghost qi, colliding with the blood-red statues.

Seeing Luo Tian unleash nine Annihilation Lights, Hell’s Immortal Kings instantly panicked. They knew the Annihilation Light’s strength and feared it would shatter all nine statues.

*Boom boom boom…*

Nine explosions echoed through the world. Ghost qi churned, everyone’s ears ringing with thunder. Hell’s elite soldiers all trembled.

“Not working!” Luo Tian shook his head. Though he dispersed much ghost qi, the blood-red statues’ light dimmed slightly. But to fully shatter them, he wasn’t sure if his ghost vein could endure the cost or if there was enough time.

“Damn! What to do?” Luo Tian’s heart raced. He looked at the Hell forces’ smug faces, cursing inwardly.

Tianyuan Sect’s depth was still shallow. Luo Tian was certain if Wan Lingkong had enough time, he could break it. But there wasn’t enough time.

Everyone in Tianyuan Sect was anxious. If Immortals forced their way out, they would suffer heavy losses—no one could withstand the Six Heavens and Hells force. But currently, it was a slow death; when domains broke, Tianyuan Sect disciples still couldn’t resist. And Immortals would be drained by the formation.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian’s heart raced. The cracks on their combined domains spread outward, looking ready to shatter at any moment.

Chapter 2717: Arrival

“Shenglong Sect?”

“Sahai King City?” Hearing these voices, Luo Tian’s group smiled. Originally, breaking the Six Heavens and Hells formation allowed Tianyuan Sect to recover slightly. But they were still at a disadvantage. Now, Shenglong Sect and Sahai King City arrived—though their numbers were small, they felt like snow in a time of need. After all, Hell’s side wasn’t in good shape either.

Shenglong Sect had tens of thousands. Their leader was Zang Yunfei and three sect elders. They showed no fear, leading Shenglong Sect’s people to charge toward Hell’s rear. Meanwhile, Sahai King City was led by Ran Hao, with Shao Honglang and three vice-hall masters following. They joined forces with Shenglong Sect, attacking Hell’s army.

“What’s happening?” Seeing the sudden appearance of over a million people, Hell’s Immortals were panicked. Their faces darkened.

“Haha! Heaven won’t destroy Tianyuan Sect!” Laughter echoed as Tianyuan Sect disciples watched Hell’s rear explode. Their morale surged, attacking Hell’s so-called elites with both front and back.

The battlefield suddenly became chaotic. The Immortal battlefield also erupted in blood, with a late-stage Immortal King pierced by Luo Tian’s spear and falling from the sky.

The battle gradually tilted toward Tianyuan Sect. Diao Dezhu and others sighed in relief. This tough battle had finally been survived. Now, they just needed to eliminate these Immortals to fully stabilize Tianyuan Sect.

“But why did these forces dare attack Hell?” Unlike Nan Gong Yuqing’s ease, Hell’s Saint Princes were anxious. Luo Tian had killed one late-stage Immortal King; the other two were also dangerous, struggling to hold on.

Had Hell won this battle? Even if they did, who could say they had truly won?

Ye Qiu continuously fought Long Jie. Watching Hell’s elites die, twenty Immortals had been lost. This was ten halls united, yet they still suffered such losses and continued to lose. Even if they eventually won, Hell wouldn’t be considered victorious.

Immortals outnumbered Tianyuan Sect. Soldiers outnumbered them too. Yet they were pushed to such a state by Tianyuan Sect. After this battle, Hell’s阎罗十殿 and several kings were also severely wounded.

“Reinforcements! Why haven’t they arrived yet!” Several kings’ armies shouted. They weren’t like the阎罗十殿; this time, they had brought almost all their resources. Now, losses were heavy. If completely wiped out, it would be over.

They wouldn’t have sent anyone if they knew Luo Tian and Yao Chen had blocked Hell’s returning forces.

“Indeed, why haven’t they arrived yet?” The sky battlefield also felt confused. They naturally didn’t believe Luo Tian’s words—hundreds of thousands, nine late-stage Immortal Kings.

“Everyone dies! None shall escape!” Luo Tian roared, slicing with the Celestial Sword. He targeted Li Yuqing, who fought Jiang Sixi.

At the same time, the Rupture Spear was thrown, becoming a dark light toward two mid-stage Immortal Kings fighting Gu Qianxue.

The Immortal battlefield still remained weak. Most fought one-on-two or even one-on-three.

“Master, take care! I can’t hold on!” A senior spat blood, killed by three mid-stage Immortal Kings.

Tang Xinghuo, a wandering cultivator from the Immortal Realm, had followed Luo Tian to break into the Timeless Mountain. He had remained in Tianyuan Sect.

“Still not enough!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned red. He hadn’t paid much attention to Tang Xinghuo since sending him to Tianyuan Sect. But even with Hell’s forces coming, Tang Xinghuo hadn’t left—showing his good character.

“Damn it! I didn’t expect to die so shamefully!”

“I’ve dominated the Immortal Realm for years, making people fear me. Can you kill me?” A roar echoed. Shengsheng Elder Yin Yitian unleashed a terrifying aura, blood runes wrapping around one of the attacking mid-stage Immortal Kings.

“Shared Fate and Death Technique!” Yin Yitian shouted. Their auras rapidly vanished, sacrificing one mid-stage Immortal King.

Luo Tian watched Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian die, feeling deep regret. But he had no choice now.

After their deaths, four mid-stage Immortal Kings were freed. With Gu Qianxue fighting two others, four immediately rushed toward Luo Tian.

Two late-stage Immortal Kings and six mid-stage ones instantly surrounded Luo Tian. He wasn’t frightened but happy. If the six attacked others, Tianyuan Sect’s losses would be greater. Luo Tian didn’t want to see that.

“Come on, all of you!” Luo Tian laughed. Facing eight opponents without fear, he was like a supreme warrior. His left hand held the Celestial Sword; his right hand gripped the Rupture Spear.

“Annihilation Light!” Luo Tian whispered, five Annihilation Lights bursting forth toward the five. At the same time, his Demon Cloud Wings flapped, stirring the heavens and creating a storm before him. *Boom boom...*

But at the same time, eight attacks instantly reached Luo Tian’s front, striking him and causing his body to crack.

Five blood splashes fell from the sky as five Annihilation Lights killed three mid-stage Immortal Kings. The other three were also severely wounded.

“Cough cough…” Luo Tian spat two mouthfuls of blood. He gazed at the remaining five, most threatening being the two late-stage Immortal Kings.

“Everyone dies!” Luo Tian murmured. He didn’t care about the Annihilation Light’s cost, raising his hand to unleash another five divine lights. *Boom boom boom...*

Three blood mists rose, three mid-stage Immortal Kings turned into mist. Meanwhile, the Rupture Spear pierced through one late-stage Immortal King’s arm.

*Crack…*

But after this, a crisp sound echoed. The mirror showed cracks.

“Can’t endure it?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a bitter smile, watching the cracked Sinful Mirror. He knew the mirror was变态 but had limits. Luo Tian could only hope it lasted longer.

But now, it seemed the mirror was at its limit. After all, since blocking Hell’s returning forces, it hadn’t stopped.

“Haha! Without that light, what else do you have?” Hearing the mirror’s power drop, a laugh echoed.

“Techniques? You two aren’t worthy of my techniques. It’s just troublesome!” Luo Tian looked at the two late-stage Immortal Kings, his eyes showing disdain. The Yellow River Step activated, and he vanished from the spot.

Both sides were bloodied, fighting wildly. They occasionally switched opponents to kill more enemies. At this point, no one knew who would win.

Luo Tian had just vanished when the sky trembled. A powerful pressure came from the shattered sky, descending upon the entire battlefield. That pressure made everyone stop.

Four figures stepped out from the shattered sky, all clad in black robes. Their bodies radiated thick ghost qi. Standing there, they were like the heavens above everyone.

Chapter 2718: Any More?

The overwhelming pressure made the battlefield instantly pause. Everyone’s eyes were filled with disbelief, gazing at the four figures in the sky.

Black robes covered their bodies, embroidered with four patterns representing Hell’s four halls. Their faces were solemn, gazing at Tianyuan Mountain with furrowed brows.

“Ten Halls’ Hall Masters, late-stage Immortal Kings!” Luo Tian’s group felt their hearts sink. The worst outcome had arrived, though only four were present. Their strength could sweep over everything.

Huangtian Hall Master, Pingdeng Hall Master, Kushen Hall Master, and Taiping Hall Master stood there. Hell’s people were invigorated.

“Didn’t they say late-stage Immortal Kings couldn’t descend into the Middle Three Realms? How did they appear!” Nan Gong Yuqing and others were shocked.

“They have a way to descend into the Middle Three Realms, but it costs dearly. This cost is huge!” Luo Tian replied.

The appearance of four late-stage Immortal Kings was fatal for Tianyuan Sect. Their strength could sweep over the sect at its peak.

“Waste! Retreat!” Huangtian Hall Master shouted, his voice filled with strong dissatisfaction. They had expected to see Hell’s forces annihilating Tianyuan Sect, coming just in case.

But now, it was this situation—Hell’s side suffered heavy losses and was currently suppressed.

“Yes!” Hearing their words, people from all factions began to break free of their opponents and retreat toward the base of Tianyuan Mountain.

*Huff huff…*

On Tianyuan Mountain, Tianyuan Sect disciples and Shenglong Sect and Sahai King City people gathered. Heavy breathing echoed, their eyes on Hell’s forces and the four peak powers above.

Luo Tian’s group also dared not act rashly. Now, control had returned to Hell; the pressure of four late-stage Immortal Kings was too great.
