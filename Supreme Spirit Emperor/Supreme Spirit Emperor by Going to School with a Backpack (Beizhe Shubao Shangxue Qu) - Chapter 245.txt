“you ungrateful little brat! I’ve given you my炼毒珠 to eat, yet you’ve taken another as your master. You even hit me and tied me up! How can you betray me like this?” Gu Lei suddenly became irritable, as if wounded, wailing incessantly.

Luo Tian’s face lit up with ecstatic joy. His forehead still bore a massive bruise, but now he no longer regarded the Soul-Eating Silkworm as an enemy.

The Soul-Eating Silkworm’s power was undeniable. To Luo Tian, its true strength surpassed even the most formidable masters of the Sage level by a terrifying margin. Its methods were astonishing, especially its ambushes—no one could escape its tricks. Having such a creature protect Sun Mengru made Luo Tian feel considerably reassured.

“Ungrateful! Unjust!” Gu Lei, after being subdued by the group’s combined efforts, finally severed the silkworm’s threads. Yet he still felt a pang of regret, rolling on the starry ground and refusing to get up, his eyes filled with a sly defiance.

“Um… did I go too far?” Sun Mengru, seeing Gu Lei’s tearful display, felt a flicker of guilt and addressed Luo Tian.

“No problem, don’t take it to heart. That kid’s just like that!” Luo Tian stepped forward and kicked Gu Lei’s backside, sending him flying.

“You little brat, stop faking it! Just say what you want, and I’ll compensate you. Sun Mengru nearly lost her life; that little creature clearly has some intelligence—it knows it almost killed her, so this is its way of repaying the favor. You’ve only lost a single炼毒珠; what’s so big about it?” Luo Tian chuckled, knowing Gu Lei’s antics after years of friendship. When Gu Lei stuck out his backside, Luo Tian immediately knew what he was about to do.

Hearing Luo Tian’s promise of compensation, Gu Lei grinned and sprang up, his eyes gleaming with mischief as he eyed the Lingyun Cauldron and Jiyan Bell still partially hidden by Luo Tian.

“Brother-in-law, are you not giving me that Lingyun Cauldron? You know I’m a great alchemist. I haven’t encountered a decent cauldron in years. Are you giving me one to experience the power of a pseudo-Era Treasure?” Gu Lei rubbed his hands, drooling over the Lingyun Cauldron.

“Go to hell… you’re not an alchemist, you’re a poison artisan! You’ve made a pile of toxic pills and a bunch of aphrodisiacs!” Luo Tian kicked Gu Lei far away, shouting.

“Brother-in-law, you’re my own brother-in-law! How precious is the炼毒珠? You know it well. This is favoritism, abandoning virtue for beauty, undervaluing your brother-in-law!” Gu Lei, in his sly mode, was unstoppable. He’d long coveted Luo Tian’s Lingyun Cauldron and wouldn’t miss this chance.

“Go away… go away…” Luo Tian grew impatient, but Gu Lei clung to him like a band-aid.

Sun Mengru’s heart fluttered uncontrollably, each “brother-in-law” Gu Lei called out making her chest tighten and breath falter.

Luo Tian remained oblivious, accustomed to calling Gu Lei that for years. Others also didn’t pay much attention.

“Take it… take it!” Luo Tian finally gave in to Gu Lei’s persistence and barked.

“Ah! Haha!” Gu Lei sauntered over to the Lingyun Cauldron, his eyes burning with desire as he gently caressed it.

“Damn, why don’t I have a sister? Why can’t I refine炼毒珠!” Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong, watching Gu Lei’s show-off, took the Lingyun Cauldron without stashing it in a storage ring but instead carried it in their hands, standing before them. Though they said nothing, their smug glances betrayed Gu Lei’s triumph, leaving Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong seething.

“What’s your next move? Return to the Divine Clan?” Luo Tian flew to Sun Mengru’s side, his eyes filled with reluctance as he asked.

Seeing Luo Tian approach, Sun Mengru forced down her sorrow and smiled faintly: “Grandpa Sun He Feng is waiting for me to save him. Thank you… I owe you…”

Sun Mengru’s words were cut short by Luo Tian, who interjected: “Don’t mention owing. If anything, I’m the one who owes you!”

“Is it truly just a debt?” Sun Mengru gazed at Luo Tian, feeling a pang of emptiness.

“Indeed, he already has a wife. His kindness toward me is merely repaying a debt from the past!” Sun Mengru sighed inwardly, her chest aching inexplicably.

“If you’re returning to the Divine Clan, we’ll be passing through anyway!” Luo Tian, unaware of Sun Mengru’s disappointment, spoke softly.

The Divine and Demon Ancient Cave was perilous, but Luo Tian still intended to investigate. Yet he didn’t want Sun Mengru to know; if she did, with the debt of two sacred herbs he’d given her, she’d insist on accompanying him. That was something Luo Tian couldn’t allow.

“Okay,” Sun Mengru didn’t refuse Luo Tian’s invitation, nodding gently and following him.

The Soul-Eating Silkworm wriggled on Sun Mengru’s forearm before dissolving into a silver light, attaching itself to her earlobe like an earring. To anyone else, it seemed harmless.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian led Sun Mengru and Gu Lei, who was still showing off, to prepare for the journey toward the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

But as they just set off, a blood-red light suddenly appeared before Luo Tian, its crimson head piercing toward his chest like icy fangs.

“Again!” Luo Tian felt a chill, recognizing the familiar sensation. He hadn’t expected this opponent to strike after his battle.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian sneered, launching the Dao of Sealing Magic with a punch toward the void. The overwhelming force surged into the emptiness.

Blood splattered; Luo Tian’s shoulder bled, and streaks of blood marked the void.

“Again, they fled?” Luo Tian leaped with the幽冥鬼步 (Yin Shadow Ghost Step), plunging into the void. The figure, as before, struck and vanished, leaving Luo Tian only a glimpse of its tail.

“Little one, don’t just eat without working—go catch that person for me!” Luo Tian addressed the Soul-Eating Silkworm on Sun Mengru’s ear.

“Uwuwu…” The silkworm transformed into a living creature, glaring at Luo Tian with defiant eyes.

“Alright, go! Bring him back!” Sun Mengru softly soothed it. The silkworm nodded, then vanished in a flash.

“Truly formidable!” Gu Lei marveled at the silkworm’s speed, inwardly regretting he’d tricked Luo Tian into giving him a pseudo-Era Treasure. He eyed Luo Tian’s Jiyan Bell with greedy thoughts.

“Wum…” Soon, a tremor echoed from the void. A battered figure appeared before Luo Tian’s group. Upon closer inspection, a tiny silkworm the size of a grain of rice clung to the figure’s robe, flying out of the void.

“Uwuwu…” The silkworm circled Sun Mengru, seemingly boasting its success.

“Alright, alright—you’re the best!” Sun Mengru smiled, placing a pill in her palm.

The group stared in awe at the tiny creature; within mere tens of breaths, it had caught a killer who even Luo Tian couldn’t pursue. How terrifying was this little thing? Even Luo Tian marveled, but the stronger the silkworm, the happier he was—Sun Mengru’s safety had another layer of protection.

The silkworm’s tiny eyes glowed, instantly devouring the pill. It then patted its belly in dissatisfaction before returning to Sun Mengru’s ear.

“You’re really persistent, aren’t you? That was you in the Fire Domain last time, wasn’t it?” Luo Tian yanked the blood-clad killer forward, unleashing Dao power to seal his cultivation.

“Speak—who hired you to kill me?” Luo Tian asked softly, tearing off the killer’s mask to reveal his youthful face.

“Truly young—such an age, yet already at the Sage’s initial stage. Skilled in assassination; it’s a pity he died!” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the youth.

“Pf…” The killer spat blood, his face pale as he transformed into a wisp of white smoke, vanishing from Luo Tian’s group.

Chapter 1057: Arrival at the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave

Luo Tian watched the killer turn into white smoke, his group all expressing admiration. He hadn’t expected such decisiveness from the killer.

“A single strike and retreat, calmness and decisiveness—this is a true assassin’s professionalism. He never spoke a word, revealing nothing useful! Not even giving us a chance to soul-search!” Wan Lingkong sighed.

“Xiu Luo City truly deserves its reputation as a sanctuary for assassins. Only Xiu Luo City could cultivate such high-level killers!” Luo Tian shook his head, eyes cold.

Though he wasn’t afraid of these assassins’ pursuits, they were deadly. He never knew when he might be caught off guard and killed. After all, no one could live in constant tension forever.

“Be careful; Xiu Luo City’s people are no joke. They kill to prove their path, claiming no one is beyond their reach. If this failure didn’t work, they’ll send stronger ones until they kill you!” Sun Mengru’s eyes held worry as she addressed Luo Tian.

“No problem; they’re not qualified to kill me!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened, turning to Wan Lingkong and the others.

“You three can’t come with me—it’s too dangerous. Return to the Demon Clan and have Nan Gong Yuqing and the elders contact Xiu Luo City, issuing some tasks. I want to see if Xiu Luo City dares accept!” Luo Tian raised an eyebrow, his gaze mocking.

Wan Lingkong and the others frowned slightly, reluctant to let Luo Tian go alone. They shook their heads in refusal.

“I’m not telling you to do nothing—find a way to contact Xiu Luo City and offer conditions, making them accept assassinating the leaders of major sects. That’s your mission. Don’t worry; if I’m in danger, I’ll return to the Demon Clan and meet you!” Luo Tian reiterated his promise to prioritize safety.

“I’ll go with you!” Jiang Nanxuan stepped forward, addressing Luo Tian with a voice that was ethereal. Luo Tian chuckled in response.

For Jiang Nanxuan, Luo Tian always felt a strange respect—why, he couldn’t explain. He rarely argued with Jiang Nanxuan.

“Fine,” Luo Tian nodded reluctantly, allowing Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Wan Lingkong to return to the Demon Clan.

“Brother-in-law, keep an eye on this kid!” Zheng Xin and the others repeatedly warned Jiang Nanxuan before Luo Tian kicked them out.

“Let’s go,” Luo Tian turned to Sun Mengru and Jiang Nanxuan, the three vanishing into the starry void.

Sun Mengru urgently needed to return to the Divine Clan, so they didn’t move as slowly as Luo Tian’s group before.

In just three days, the trio reached the border between the Divine and Demon Clans. As they neared the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, more cultivators surrounded them—its fame as one of the Nine Perilous Zones was undeniable. Many sought to ascend swiftly, perhaps stumbling upon an ancient inheritance.

“Here we are,” Sun Mengru whispered, having told Luo Tian earlier they’d part here. Now, the trio had just entered the cave’s domain.

As soon as they stepped in, Luo Tian sensed its peculiarity—two opposing yet harmonious forces clashed and merged in the starry void.

A distant, heart-stirring aura made Luo Tian frown slightly. Though far away, he still felt its distinctiveness.

In the distance, a black hole-like entrance loomed in the void, seemingly devouring everything. Its other half glowed radiantly, illuminating the entire void in contrast to the cave’s aura.

“Do you intend to enter the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave?” Sun Mengru smiled, clearly seeing Luo Tian’s intent.

“Yes, I need to find something inside,” Luo Tian nodded after hesitating.

“I’ll accompany you then,” Sun Mengru said softly, her eyes resolute as she gazed at Luo Tian.

“Return to the Divine Clan first; Grandpa Sun He Feng’s injury mustn’t be delayed. If you’re late, something might go wrong!” Luo Tian saw Sun Mengru’s determination and seized her weakness—Sun He Feng.

Sun Mengru bit her lip, contemplative before speaking: “I’ll return to the Divine Clan first and come back in three days.”

“Alright,” Luo Tian nodded, smiling.

Sun Mengru nodded and parted ways with Luo Tian, flying toward the Divine Clan. Luo Tian exhaled deeply; he hadn’t expected to wait for her, as the cave was too dangerous. He’d only intended to test it—should he fail, he’d find another path.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan flew toward the cave. The closer they got, the more their hearts trembled.

At a hundred miles away from the cave, it was already crowded with people—some were independent cultivators, others local forces of the Divine and Demon Regions. All eyed the cave with caution, wary of its devouring nature.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan stood at the edge of the crowd, unnoticed—so many people, they were just seen as ordinary trainees.

At the front of the crowd stood several factions. Their robes fluttered without wind, each led by a Sage-level elder. Among them were young ones, their eyes arrogant as they surveyed the crowd with disdain.

“Ruyi Sect… Four Symbols Pavilion…” The people murmured, eyeing the factions with deep caution.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan stood among the crowd, hearing the murmurs. Their eyes gleamed—these factions were top-tier in the Divine and Demon Region. Some were subordinates of the Divine Clan, others of the Demon Clan; their commonality was strength. Even the Divine and Demon Clans treated them with respect.

“It seems this cave’s stir has drawn many major factions. I wonder how many dare to enter,” someone mused.

“Hmph, no more than three. A few days ago, the Divine Clan’s goddess entered with a group but only she emerged confusedly. How dare these factions enter?” The crowd murmured, their eyes filled with disdain toward the powerful factions.

“Move aside!” As people discussed, a cold sneer echoed. A formidable aura made everyone startle, then turn their heads toward the source.

“Boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed. A fearsome beast charged through the void, its tail churning the stars. On it stood two elders and two youths, their faces cold.

The most distinctive feature of the four was that the two elders were twins, and so were the youths—identical in appearance but dressed in black and white.

“It’s the Yin-Yang Sect!” The crowd, previously gloomy, parted reluctantly to make way for the beast. Even those arrogant sect leaders lowered their gazes, their arrogance replaced by solemnity.

“Truly brazen!” Luo Tian smirked, no longer having Gu Lei and Zheng Xin to provoke. He and Jiang Nanxuan remained low-key, avoiding trouble. They let the beast pass without protest.

But as the massive beast passed before Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan, it snorted, then turned abruptly to face them.

“You carry a precious treasure!” A black-robed youth on the beast gazed at Luo Tian, speaking from above.

“No,” Luo Tian frowned slightly, not wanting to argue.

Though he didn’t want trouble, others weren’t so cautious. Hearing Luo Tian’s answer, the black-robed youth’s eyes darkened.

“You’re lying. My beast has an abnormal sensitivity to treasures—it never fails. You definitely carry a precious treasure, and not just one!” The youth spoke as if he were the world’s master.

“What are you? To question me like this, it’s none of your business if I have treasures. If you want to steal, just do it—don’t expect me to hand them over!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened. The two youths were at the Sage-level middle stage, and the elders at the Sage-level late stage. Luo Tian wasn’t afraid.

“Haha, are you challenging us?” The two youths spoke in unison. “In the Divine and Demon Region, it’s been a long time since anyone challenged our Yin-Yang Sect!”

“Go to hell, you’re not even worthy of my contempt. You haven’t the guts to be so arrogant in front of me!” Luo Tian didn’t want to waste words. The opponent clearly sought trouble, hoping he’d strike first and then be killed, making it seem like Luo Tian had provoked the Yin-Yang Sect.

Chapter 1058: Yin-Yang Sage Princes

In the starry void a hundred miles from the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, people gaped at Luo Tian. No one expected such a common youth to dare defy the Yin-Yang Sect’s prince.

The Yin-Yang Sect was a unique entity in the Divine and Demon Region. Other sects had one master or sage prince, but the Yin-Yang Sect was different—its masters were always two, and its sage princes too. The sect had eight out of ten members as twin brothers, their strength terrifying. Even the Divine and Demon Clans feared them.

“You’re playing with fire!” The black-robed Yin prince’s face darkened, no words. He raised his hand and struck Luo Tian with a wave of demonic energy.

“Don’t act like a prostitute wanting to be a saint! You can’t even handle it!” Luo Tian’s face was cold, unafraid of the overwhelming black hand. Golden sage power burst from his body, and he struck back with Dao power. The collision sent a shockwave outward, making the crowd gasp.

But soon, their gazes turned more stunned—this was the Yin prince of the Yin-Yang Sect, yet his entire arm exploded in a burst of blood. His face was pale as he stood on the beast.

In contrast, Luo Tian’s body glowed with divine light, like a war god standing firm. His palm had no cracks.

“Who is this person? How strong! His body is terrifying!” The crowd murmured, finding Luo Tian enigmatic.

“Kid, cut off your arms and hand over the treasures; we’ll spare your life!” The two elders were also uneasy, having felt Luo Tian’s strength.

But for years, the Yin-Yang Sect had ruled the Divine and Demon Region with arrogance. Even the Divine and Demon Clans treated them respectfully, making their disciples accustomed to superiority.

Yet today was unlucky—they met Luo Tian, the one who had killed even the Divine and Demon Clans’ sage princes.

“Move aside, old man! It’s obvious your family’s lack of shame is inherited! You started the provocation, yet still act superior!” Luo Tian shouted back, his voice filled with disdain. His state was at its peak.

“Move aside!” A nearby faction leader finally shouted Luo Tian’s name, making everyone turn to the unassuming youth.

“Luo Tian!” Everyone turned their gaze to Luo Tian, seeing his golden light radiating.

“He actually dared to show up!” No one expected Luo Tian to appear, yet he had challenged the Yin-Yang Sect, second only to the Divine and Demon Clans.

Luo Tian now represented pseudo-Era Treasures in the Nine Regions, and it was said he carried sacred herbs—essentially a living treasure vault.

“Ah! That’s why Qinghong Lion felt your treasures!” The two Yin-Yang Sect princes smiled.

“Do you think a Demon Clan member can protect you? Yuyuan Mountain’s Diao Yuanshan is terrifying, but he can’t reach the Divine and Demon Region. Boldly appearing like this—your courage is admirable!” The two princes spoke in unison, their voices as one.

“This is the Divine and Demon Region, not the Beast Region or your garbage Four Symbols Star Region. There are many people here you can’t afford to offend. Even the Demon Clan can’t protect you if you anger them!” The princes continued without letting Luo Tian respond, still looking down.

“Boom…” But the answer was a scream as Luo Tian’s fist smashed into the beast beneath them, turning it into blood mist. Blood splattered onto their robes.

“Brutal! Brutally killing the four’s mount in front of them!” The crowd murmured, watching Luo Tian with a smile.

“Haha! Yin-Yang Sect, you’ve become this way!” Several major factions approached, their young men smiling as they watched the Yin-Yang Sect’s princes.

“The Yin-Yang Sect has truly stumbled big time, getting their face slapped in front of Luo Tian!” People looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Kill…” The situation had escalated too far to talk. The two princes transformed into black and white streaks, charging at Luo Tian.

The two Sage-level elders also glared with killing intent, summoning eighty-one banners that spread into the void, surrounding Luo Tian and sealing it.

“Split-Soul Banners! The Yin-Yang Sect’s four have truly unleashed their fury, striking with death!”

The two Yin-Yang Sect princes, Lin Yangquan and Lin Yinming, each wielded a dual-chakram of sun and moon. They surged toward Luo Tian with overwhelming power.

“I don’t have time to waste; end this quickly!” Luo Tian held the Crack-Heaven Spear in one hand and swung the Dao of Sealing Magic with the other. In an instant, he clashed with them.

“Crack!” Golden lightning surged as the Crack-Heaven Spear met Lin Yangquan’s dual-chakram.

On the other side, the Dao of Sealing Magic collided with Lin Yinming’s spear. The crowd was stunned—Lin Yinming’s dual-chakram shattered upon touching Luo Tian’s fist, scattering into fragments.

“Unbelievable! A hand-to-hand battle against a Sage-level weapon, shattering it with one punch!” The crowd gaped at Luo Tian. Even if martial arts were strong, without a body’s support, it was impossible to shatter a Sage-level middle-stage weapon.

Yet Luo Tian had done so, and the Yin-Yang Sect’s weapons were no slouch. But they shattered under his fist.

“Unbelievable!” The crowd watched as Luo Tian struck Lin Yangquan again, shattering his dual-chakram.

Black and white figures retreated, their faces pale as they spat blood, eyes filled with shock. Their weapons had shattered, causing them pain. They couldn’t believe Luo Tian was so strong—just one clash and they were defeated.

“Kill!” The princes’ eyes burned with defiance, for the Yin-Yang Sect’s greatest strength was their combined technique.

“Yin-Yang Great Seal!” They chanted, merging black and white spiritual energy into a Taijitu pattern. It surged toward Luo Tian.

“Dao of Sealing Magic, one strike to break all techniques!” Luo Tian roared, launching the Dao of Sealing Magic. His aura surged skyward, unafraid of their combined technique. The Dao of Sealing Magic clashed with the Taijitu.

“Boom…” Thunder echoed as Luo Tian, capable of slaying even Sage-level late-stage masters, faced the Yin-Yang Great Seal. Though powerful, it was still insufficient against him.

The seemingly invincible Taijitu shattered in the crowd’s eyes, sending chaotic spiritual energy toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it! What kind of monster is this? Even the Yin-Yang Great Seal was shattered!” The two princes, their minds in sync without words, retreated a thousand feet.

“Show me your tricks!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with cold light, his golden spiritual energy swirling around him. His overwhelming aura spread across the void.

“Didn’t they say he couldn’t cultivate anymore, stuck at Sage-level middle? Go to hell! What nonsense!” Another faction’s people stared at Luo Tian, their fear evident.

The Yin-Yang Sect princes’ names were legendary in the Divine and Demon Region. Their combined technique was unmatched, save for the Divine and Demon Clans. Yet Luo Tian had done it—easily, with a single punch.

“Yin-Yang Life and Death Curse!” The two princes spoke in unison, their hands moving swiftly.

“Yin-Yang Life and Death Curse! The Yin-Yang Sect’s secret technique, now mastered by them!” People gasped as the two princes’ hand signs formed, merging into their bodies.

“Wum…” A tremor spread as the two figures intertwined, fusing into one. Their aura was overwhelming, eyes glowing with terrifying light as they stared at Luo Tian.

“Same origin!” Luo Tian’s eyes also showed shock, gazing at the fused brothers.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Thunder echoed in the void as the two figures merged into one, their aura skyrocketing. Their cultivation surged rapidly.

“Sage-level middle… Sage-level late…” In an instant, the black and white figures reached Sage-level late—just a step from Sage-level peak.

Chapter 1059: One Punch Shatters Yin-Yang

A hundred miles from the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, the two Yin-Yang Sect princes fused into one under the crowd’s awe.

“This is the Yin-Yang Life and Death Curse? I never expected it to be so effective. If they reach Sage-level late, how terrifying would it be? Would it even surpass Sage-level peak?” The crowd marveled at the overwhelming aura of the Yin-Yang prince.

“Yin-Yang Life and Death, one step alive, one step dead. Only with such perfect harmony could it be achieved. Few in the Yin-Yang Sect have mastered it. We two are too dull, never managing to perfect it. The greatest flaw of the Yin-Yang Life and Death Curse is if it fails, one would be incinerated by the curse!” The two Sage-level elders spoke, their eyes filled with admiration for the fused Yin-Yang prince.

“Too difficult! What kind of harmony would it take to be like one person?” The crowd murmured.

“The Yin-Yang Sect princes were born with our sect’s two masters daily exchanging blood, swapping their crimson. They ate and lived together, even sharing women. Only through such upbringing did they achieve this unparalleled harmony!”

“But the two princes still haven’t mastered the true essence of the Yin-Yang Life and Death Curse. If they had, after casting it, they would have reached Sage-level peak!” The two elders’ words stunned the crowd.

“Kid, now I’ll see what you’ve got!” The Yin-Yang prince spoke, his voice now one.

“Such a bizarre technique!” Luo Tian’s body also roared with thunder, facing this formidable opponent. He needed to unleash his full strength to defeat him—otherwise, he might end up fleeing.

“Enter the Demon Realm!” A wave of demonic energy enveloped Luo Tian, as if a demon king had returned. His aura surged to its peak but didn’t break the Sage-level late threshold.

“Die!” The Yin-Yang prince’s face was cold, his voice like thunder in the void. He flashed forward, one hand holding the Yin and the other the Yang, both fists striking.

The overwhelming power of their combined strength was terrifying. Even Luo Tian had to be cautious.

“Dao of Sealing Magic!” Luo Tian’s black hair flew as he swung his fists, clashing with the Yin-Yang prince.

The thunderous clash echoed again in the void. Luo Tian was unusually serious, his first true battle. The Jiyan Bell was summoned to protect him, sharing the attack’s force.

The crowd watched their clash, eyes wide. The sect princes of major factions felt a bitter taste—before they thought the Yin-Yang prince fought with two against one, but now it was clear: together, they weren’t just double the strength.

“Luo Tian is truly powerful! Even against this situation, he doesn’t fall behind!” Compared to the Yin-Yang prince, Luo Tian’s performance was astonishing. Though the Jiyan Bell absorbed part of the attack, he was still at Sage-level middle—yet he could withstand this Yin-Yang prince. It was incredible.

The void cracked as Luo Tian and the Yin-Yang prince clashed relentlessly, unafraid of each other’s fists.

“You’re really a thorn in my side!” The Yin-Yang prince, wounded and retreating, gazed at Luo Tian with a serious expression.

“You’re not bad either!” Luo Tian coughed blood, his golden body radiating divine light but with fine cracks spreading across it. He was also injured.

“It’s over!” The Yin-Yang prince spoke solemnly, his hands moving swiftly before him. A terrifying aura surged from him.

“Yin-Yang Convergence Seal!” The deep thunderous sound echoed as the Yin-Yang prince formed a black-and-white seal. A Taijitu pattern with Dao essence surged from his hands, colliding with Luo Tian’s.

“Seven Demon Blades of the Abyss!” Black demon blades凝聚, and the梵天攻杀大术 (Brahma Attack) surged into the seventh blade. Black blades cleaved stars, colliding with the Yin-Yang Taijitu seal.

“Boom…” Thunder rolled as both techniques’ power was overwhelming, capable of killing a Sage-level late. Their collision turned the void within a hundred miles into vacuum.

“Though it’s somewhat unfair, I can’t let myself die!” Luo Tian blocked the Yin-Yang prince’s seal. He didn’t waste words, pulling down his injury-imbued bow from his back.
