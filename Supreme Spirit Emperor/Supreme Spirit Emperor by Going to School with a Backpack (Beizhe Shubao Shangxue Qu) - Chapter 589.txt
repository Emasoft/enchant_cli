“The battle at the Rising Dragon Sect has begun. These people are coming to reinforce it!” Luo Tian spoke softly, already understanding their purpose.

Although we destroyed the teleportation array, those four sects will still arrive. It takes us an hour to reach the Rising Dragon Sect, but those four sects have surely learned that we've destroyed Zhongshan City!” Run Hongyu said, his body covered in blood—though not his own.

“Then let’s go to the Rising Dragon Sect. I’ll leave a means behind here,” Luo Tian said, raising his hand. A series of golden array flags flew from his palm—none other than the Ten Thousand Heavens’ Divine Punishment Array.

“Go…” After setting it up, Luo Tian spoke softly and soared toward the Rising Dragon Sect.

Just as Luo Tian and his companions departed, a dark cloud appeared from ten thousand miles away, drifting toward Zhongshan City.

“I wonder how the Star River Mansion is doing?” Luo Tian felt concern, his worries more for the Star River Mansion than the Rising Dragon Sect.

The Rising Dragon Sect had faced such a crisis before; Star River Mansion would surely know. With Ye Liangchen and his connections, Star River Mansion wouldn’t sit idly by. If Star River Mansion intervened, such a siege on the Rising Dragon Sect would never have happened.

…At the Rising Dragon Sect, blood dyed the sky. An hour ago, four sects had launched an attack with tens of thousands of disciples.

The Rising Dragon Sect had grown to over a million disciples after years of development, holding an advantage in numbers but not in strength. Thus, the two sides remained evenly matched for now.

The disciples of the Rising Dragon Sect knew this balance was temporary, as neither side had yet deployed their top combat forces. The current situation did not favor the Rising Dragon Sect; they relied solely on numbers. As time passed, their disadvantage became evident.

“Ancestor, those four sects keep sending reinforcements. If they continue, we won’t last long,” Li Changfeng said, his face anxious as he addressed Zang Yunfei and the others.

“Ancestor, we’ve received word that our young disciples secretly sent out of the sect were annihilated by the four sects!” Zuo Qiu Ming said, his face pale.

Zang Yunfei and the others sat silently, their eyes cold but their hearts knowing this battle might truly be lost—no miracle would come.

Watching disciples die one by one, Zang Yunfei’s heart ached. The Rising Dragon Sect had once boasted three million disciples who participated in the Struggle for Heaven, losing two million and leaving only over a million. They had never recovered since.

Though the sect’s numbers hadn’t grown much, their disciples’ strength had risen significantly. Now, with such losses—within just an hour, twenty thousand dead—the Rising Dragon Sect would be destroyed within a day.

They could only watch their disciples perish, for if they intervened, the enemy’s top combat forces would too. That battle would accelerate rapidly; the enemy had two Half-step Immortal Kings, and they could not match them.

“Is this death?” The disciples’ hearts darkened as they met the gaze of the four sects’ masters through the crimson sky.

“Actually, we still have one more—Luo Tian!”

“Even if we all die, the Rising Dragon Sect won’t lose its lineage. Three great arts—Luo Tian will master them all!” Zang Yunfei sighed deeply.

Zang Yunfei hoped for a miracle, expecting Star River Mansion to arrive and for Xuan Dan not to return yet. The time wasn’t over.

Time passed, and an hour slipped by. The Rising Dragon Sect suffered another thirteen thousand losses.

On the other side, the four sects’ masters gathered, with two Half-step Immortal Kings leading. They sat calmly, watching their disciples fight.

Though the four sects had losses, they were fewer than the Rising Dragon Sect’s and evenly distributed.

“Rising Dragon Sect’s people really can hold their ground,” a True Immortal Peak elder said, his name Huang Tiande—the one whose grandson Luo Tian had killed.

“Of course they can hold steady; they know if they unleashed their True Immortal Peak forces, they’d die faster!” Other elders spoke softly, their voices laced with amusement.

“An entire Rising Dragon Sect—back then we didn’t destroy it because of Star River Mansion. Otherwise, how could it have stayed in the Central Three Heavens and even on Gu Yuan Sect’s territory?”

“Such a Rising Dragon Sect’s resources won’t be ours for free!” A middle-aged man sneered. Though young in appearance, he sat at the head alongside another middle-aged man—Tianyang Sect’s master Tian Ming and Feishen Sect’s master Duan Fei. To ensure stability, both had come personally.

“Master, Zhongshan City was destroyed by someone! Our reinforcements can’t arrive; it’ll take two days to fly here from Huantian City!” A voice interrupted their discussion, causing the four sects’ leaders to pause.

“What? Zhongshan City was destroyed? Who did it? Does the Rising Dragon Sect still have reinforcements?” Their hearts jolted.

“No reinforcements is minor; we’ve got enough people now. But we fear complications,” Tian Ming said softly, rising to his feet.

“Fully attack! End this!” Duan Fei also stood, addressing the crowd.

They had received news to attack the Rising Dragon Sect; Star River Mansion would not interfere, as it was about to face a major event. Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare attack the Rising Dragon Sect.

They knew the one who sent them was to destroy the Rising Dragon Sect, preventing it from aiding Star River Mansion. But now someone had destroyed Zhongshan City—someone who could vanish without a trace was no ordinary foe. They suspected Star River Mansion and wanted to end the battle swiftly; once the Rising Dragon Sect was gone, everything would be resolved.

As Tian Ming and others prepared, Zang Yunfei and his group tensed instantly.

“Is this the beginning? We must hold firm, a battle to the death!” Zang Yunfei roared, leaping into action as Tian Ming and Duan Fei moved.

“Kill…” The cries of war echoed, colliding with overwhelming power. In an instant, Tian Ming and Duan Fei reached Zang Yunfei’s group, their hands striking with the might of mountains. Two massive palms, radiating heavenly authority, collided with Zang Yunfei’s group, sending them flying and spewing blood.

“Crash…” A towering tree appeared, a black humanoid ghost standing atop it—Zang Yunfei’s first-generation ancestor transformed into a ghost.

The black specter radiated immense power, even emitting the aura of a Half-step Immortal King. Its red eyes flashed as it blocked Tian Ming’s path, the tree shrinking into its hand before swinging toward him.

Chapter 2235: The Heavens-Soaring Stone Shines ( )

“Is this your entire strength, the Rising Dragon Sect? Relying on a ghost and a tree?” Tian Ming sneered, pointing his finger.

A mountain-sized hand shot forth, colliding with the tree. Tian Ming’s face shifted slightly as Zang Yunfei’s ghostly ancestor was sent flying, releasing waves of ghostly energy. The tree shed leaves continuously.

“Pain… pain…” A child’s voice echoed as the tree cried out, making Tian Ming twitch.

“Roar…” The ghostly ancestor growled, the tree shouting wildly as it swung again at Tian Ming.

Tian Ming sneered and leaped into the air, his golden hand slamming down on the tree. The thunderous clash continued as Zang Yunfei’s ancestor fought against Tian Ming.

Meanwhile, Zang Yunfei and the others attacked Duan Fei. Though they were all at True Immortal Peak, they were no match for a Half-step Immortal King. Duan Fei, strong and robust, each strike sent Zang Yunfei’s group spewing blood. They gritted their teeth and endured.

On the other side, Li Changfeng and others found their opponents, and high-level combat forces joined the battle. The sky shattered continuously.

Yet with the top-tier clashes, the Rising Dragon Sect still remained at a disadvantage—too weak in strength and numbers. They were quickly overpowered.

The heavens roared, blood flooded the sky, dyeing the entire Rising Dragon Mountain crimson. All disciples of the Rising Dragon Sect—men and women, old and young—fought desperately, knowing this was a battle for annihilation. They gave no chance of survival to the Rising Dragon Sect.

Desperation made people terrifying; the entire sect unleashed extraordinary combat power, fighting purely on will.

Time passed swiftly—every moment saw deaths. The Rising Dragon Sect now had less than a million, and the four sects began to suffer losses.

As time passed, Zang Yunfei struggled—three True Immortal Peaks could not match a Half-step Immortal King.

*Boom, boom, boom…*

Three resounding impacts sent Zang Yunfei’s group crashing into the ground, their bodies bloodied and eyes weak. Peng Tiande even closed his eyes; he had taken most of Duan Fei’s attacks in their coordinated effort.

“Do you dare challenge us with such trash?” Duan Fei looked down, stomping toward Peng Tiande.

“Is this the end of the Rising Dragon Sect?” Zang Yunfei and the others looked desperate. Even Zang Yunfei’s ghostly ancestor was in disarray, and the tree had shed many leaves, nearing bareness.

“Let me surrender, okay?” The tree whimpered, hinting at submission.

“No!” As the tree’s words fell, a cold voice echoed, making Zang Yunfei’s group tremble.

Savage qi filled the air as a black light tore through space above Zang Yunfei’s group. At the same time, Duan Fei’s foot descended, crushing the black sword.

Duan Fei’s face shifted slightly, then he leaped back, gazing at the distance.

Eight figures appeared in Duan Fei’s vision; at their center stood a man in black robes—Luo Tian, with ghostly mist swirling around him.

“Kill!” Luo Tian said no more than one word, but that single word sent a violent killing intent through all.

“Clash…” Eight scythes interwove, and the Ghostly Eight Guards joined battle immediately. Luo Tian transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward Duan Fei.

“Luo Tian!” Zang Yunfei, Peng Tiande, and Sima Xiu were stunned, recognizing Luo Tian instantly. Their eyes flashed with joy.

“Master!” The entire Rising Dragon Sect erupted in excitement, surprised that Luo Tian had arrived at this moment.

Master—there was only one master in the Rising Dragon Sect, though that person had left it. Yet within the hearts of all disciples, there was only one master: Luo Tian.

“Late-stage True Immortal…” Zang Yunfei’s group felt a slight sigh upon sensing Luo Tian’s cultivation.

“Luo Tian, flee!” Sima Xiu shouted; he thought Luo Tian had returned to die. Late-stage True Immortal against a Half-step Immortal King—nothing.

“Luo Tian, he’s still alive! Not dead at the Hell Gate?”

“Damn it, kill my grandson!” Huang Tiande and others recognized Luo Tian but with joy.

Yet Sima Xiu’s words were too late; Luo Tian had already appeared beside Duan Fei. The Dragon Abyss Sword radiated waves, returning to Luo Tian’s hand. The second stage of the Sword Dao unfolded, and black sword energy surged downward.

“Hmph?” Duan Fei glanced at the descending blade, initially thinking Luo Tian had come to offer his head.

But upon seeing this strike, Duan Fei grew cautious—yet only slightly.

“Boom…” A punch shattered space; Duan Fei’s golden fist met Luo Tian’s black sword.

“Crack…” Luo Tian retreated, his palm aching. Duan Fei also took two steps back, his face showing surprise. His fist revealed white bones, with black qi swirling over the wound.

“Impossible! You wounded me!” Duan Fei stared at Luo Tian, who felt nervous. This was his first clash with a Half-step Immortal King.

“Clash…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, charging forward again. Facing the Dragon Abyss Sword, Duan Fei dared not be careless; he felt the sword’s unusual nature.

A late-stage True Immortal, even with a top-tier immortal artifact, would find it hard to wound a Half-step Immortal King. After all, he was a Half-step Immortal King—already touched the realm of Immortal Kings.

The clashing echoed, Duan Fei’s hand conjured a golden cone that grew rapidly. Its sharp tip sent chills through all.

In an instant, the Dragon Abyss Sword clashed with the golden cone. Cracks formed at their collision point; Luo Tian was sent flying again, his palm splitting and blood spilling.

“Strong—True Immortal Peak might not even match you!” Duan Fei observed Luo Tian, who had already sensed danger in him after two clashes.

“Clash…” Luo Tian took a deep breath, shooting the Bow of Shooting the Sun and the Divine Destruction Arrow. He moved with the arrow, swinging his black sword again toward Duan Fei.

“Go…” Duan Fei sneered, his golden cone trembling and splitting rapidly before being driven toward Luo Tian.

Each golden cone could kill a True Immortal Peak; Luo Tian had no doubt his body would be pierced if struck.

The sword cut through the air, blocking Luo Tian’s path while the Divine Destruction Arrow collided with a golden cone, altering its trajectory.

“Clang, clang…” The piercing sound echoed around Luo Tian as he wielded the Dragon Abyss Sword, blocking each golden cone—his movements were quite desperate.

“Kid, die!” As Luo Tian blocked, Duan Fei moved—his step took him behind Luo Tian, driving the golden cone toward his back.

“You die!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold; he turned abruptly, slashing downward with his sword. At the same time, his other hand conjured four fist images, striking Duan Fei fiercely.

“Plop…” The golden cone pierced Luo Tian’s abdomen, and the Dragon Abyss Sword and his fist struck Duan Fei’s body. The sword’s massive blade half-pierced Duan Fei’s shoulder, while Luo Tian’s fist struck his chest. A crack echoed from Duan Fei’s chest.

Both men locked eyes, then retreated simultaneously. Luo Tian spat blood; his abdominal wound slowly healed as he gazed at Duan Fei.

“Even match!” Zang Yunfei’s group watched Luo Tian, who had his abdomen pierced, their hearts shocked.

Duan Fei’s golden light flickered; his chest and shoulder wounds began to heal rapidly.

“Die!” Duan Fei shouted, then his other hand quickly formed a seal, sending out a powerful aura.

The golden cone trembled again, splitting and reuniting before forming a golden phantom.

“Boom…” Finally, the golden phantom grasped the towering golden cone and hurled it toward Luo Tian.

“Dead!” Luo Tian felt a chill; the golden cone pierced the sky, and if he faced it directly, he would die. This was a Half-step Immortal King’s full power—exceeding True Immortal limits, beyond what a True Immortal could withstand.

“Heavens-Soaring Stone! Kill this bastard!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, raising his hand.

“What is he doing? Throwing air?” People were startled; they saw nothing.

“You’re not human, Luo Tian! You…” But then a curse echoed in their ears.

Before they could react, a thunderous sound rose—then the void began to collapse. A fist-sized red stone appeared in their sight, expanding rapidly into a mountain and a sun.

Lightning flashed; the sun-like Heavens-Soaring Stone collided with the golden cone.

The heavens trembled, a powerful collision sound made the battlefield pause; wind swept, and the world roared.

“Pain! I curse…” A loud cry echoed as the Heavens-Soaring Stone let out a pig-like wail.

“Damn it, that old stone!” The Mountain-Sea Tree heard the Heavens-Soaring Stone’s cry, its childlike voice echoing again.

“Mountain-Sea Tree, you little bastard! You’re here too!” A low and high voice echoed.

The collision had silenced the world; the Mountain-Sea Tree’s and Heavens-Soaring Stone’s voices were unusually loud, making people’s mouths twitch.

“Do they know each other?” Luo Tian was slightly stunned but quickly understood—both the Mountain-Sea Tree and Heavens-Soaring Stone had mysterious origins.

“Help me crush this old man, it hurts so much! Look at how many leaves I’ve lost!” The Mountain-Sea Tree shouted, its trunk now nearly leafless.

“You’re so old already?” The Heavens-Soaring Stone’s voice was mocking, returning to Luo Tian’s hand.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected the Heavens-Soaring Stone to be so powerful, instantly wounding Duan Fei. The golden phantom made Luo Tian feel a strong threat.

“Good opportunity!” Luo Tian saw Duan Fei’s momentary distraction, his eyes flashing with ferocity. He moved his hands, unleashing the Path of Heaven and Humanity, then activated the Yellow Spring Step. He vanished like a ghost from the spot.

“Get out…” Duan Fei roared, slapping his hand—but it was too late. An invisible wave instantly enveloped Duan Fei, making his face pale.

“This is a domain?”

“How could it be?” Duan Fei’s heart was full of shock, feeling his hand had been weighed down by thousands of jin. He couldn’t move.

“It’s not a domain!” Duan Fei, no doubt a Half-step Immortal King and sect leader, realized in an instant this overwhelming aura wasn’t a domain. If it were, he wouldn’t have had the chance to fight back.

“Break!” Duan Fei thought, his blood surged as he rapidly activated his cultivation to break free from the invisible aura.

But this delay was enough for Luo Tian; the black sword slashed downward, striking Duan Fei’s head.

“Crack…” A crack echoed; the black Dragon Abyss Sword seemed to be clamped in place. Duan Fei’s head bled, and this strike had severely wounded him but not killed him.

“Die!” Duan Fei clearly was enraged, slapping Luo Tian’s head with his palm.

“Boom…” Luo Tian felt as if hit by a mountain, his body flying back and spitting blood. His head had cracks, and he couldn’t even hold the Dragon Abyss Sword tightly.

“Cut!” Luo Tian steadied himself, not catching his breath but conjuring a seal with one hand. The second stage of the Sword Dao unfolded, and the Dragon Abyss Sword slashed toward Duan Fei again.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed; the Dragon Abyss Sword descended slightly, slicing Duan Fei’s forehead. Blood flowed down the blade.

“You’ll die! You’ll die!” Duan Fei trembled, shouting wildly, grabbing the Dragon Abyss Sword to pull it from his head.

But just as Duan Fei raised his hand, waves of energy rose behind him. A flash of cold light pierced Duan Fei’s back.

“Plop…” Duan Fei’s face showed terror, feeling a chill in his back. He couldn’t believe there was someone else.

If it were normal, Duan Fei might not have let the assassin succeed, but now he was at his weakest and had no time to care.

“Roar…” Duan Fei roared, swinging his hand and slamming it onto the figure behind him.

“Plop…” Blood spewed; Run Hongyu flew back but smiled. Because he had succeeded—his dagger had pierced Duan Fei’s heart. Since arriving, Run Hongyu had waited for this moment, hesitating several times but finally seizing it.

To assassinate a Half-step Immortal King with late-stage True Immortal strength was suicide for others, but Run Hongyu had succeeded—paying the price of severe injury.

Duan Fei’s furious strike was no easy feat; one strike could kill a True Immortal Peak.

“Soul-Annihilation!” Luo Tian conjured seals, waves of powerful soul energy forming a soul blade that slashed toward Duan Fei’s yelling.

“Boom…” The soul blade entered Duan Fei’s body, and he finally stopped screaming. His life rapidly faded, his eyes filled with intense resentment as he fell from the sky to the ground.

“Reversing fate!”

“They’ve killed a Half-step Immortal King!” Everyone was shocked, watching Luo Tian and Run Hongyu standing there with reverence.

“Master’s might!” The Rising Dragon Sect disciples’ morale surged, their faces filled with excitement as they fiercely clashed with the four sects.

Luo Tian panted heavily, gazing at Tian Ming while exchanging glances with Run Hongyu. Both felt exhilarated but also marveled at the Half-step Immortal King’s might—only after such a fierce battle had they defeated Duan Fei, and both were now injured.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian panted, watching Tian Ming press against the first-generation ancestor’s ghostly form.

“You’ve killed Duan Fei; this won’t end well!” Tian Ming punched the first-generation ancestor, sending it flying.

“Master, I can’t fight anymore! If I keep going, I’ll die!” The Mountain-Sea Tree shouted desperately.

“No, the Heavens-Soaring Stone must go too—subdue him!” Luo Tian waved his hand, sending a red thread toward Tian Ming.

“Luo Tian, you’re not human! I can’t hold out either!” The Heavens-Soaring Stone also shouted, but this time it wasn’t as strong. It hadn’t appeared until now and had shrunk to palm size, striking Tian Ming’s head.

“Boom…” Tian Ming’s head drooped, instantly forming a large bump. The Heavens-Soaring Stone also flew back.

“Blah…” A gust of wind swept, the first-generation ancestor wielding the Mountain-Sea Tree, shouting and yelling as it brutally whipped Tian Ming’s body.

“Harming me—what can you do?”

“You see the others, how many of your Rising Dragon Sect remain?” Tian Ming spat blood, his face wild as he spoke to Luo Tian.

Hearing Tian Ming’s words, Luo Tian’s expression hardened. He glanced at the other battlefields and saw Li Changfeng and Zuo Qiu Ming struggling desperately, fighting two against one—some even three against one. With time passing, they had suffered significant losses; over ten late-stage True Immortals had died.

On the other side, the disciple battle wasn’t ideal either; the Rising Dragon Sect’s numbers were dwindling and now being suppressed by the four sects.

“We can’t let the Rising Dragon Sect be wiped out!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Though he and Run Hongyu had defeated Duan Fei, the situation was still grim. If they continued fighting, the Rising Dragon Sect’s disciples would be annihilated within a day.

Luo Tian and Run Hongyu were both injured, relying only on the first-generation ancestor’s ghostly form to hold back Tian Ming. But without them, Li Changfeng and others would face even greater difficulty—fighting Tian Ming while protecting the lives of elders and disciples.

Zang Yunfei’s group had no more strength to fight, needing time to recover.

“Luo Tian, kill Tian Ming and then leave! We’ll die at least!” Li Changfeng shouted, having been slammed in the back by a True Immortal Peak elder, his body crashing into the ground.

Luo Tian’s face darkened; he instantly appeared beside Li Changfeng, punching with four images. Blood mist erupted as the elder was obliterated by Luo Tian’s punch, blood splattering on his body.

“Heavens-Soaring Stone, Mountain-Sea Tree! If you can’t kill this old man, I’ll throw you into the latrine!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed.

“Throwing into the latrine…”

“Little master, how could you threaten me like that!” The Mountain-Sea Tree was angry and jumped around.

“I am the great Mountain-Sea Tree! How dare he throw me into a latrine? I must resist!” The Mountain-Sea Tree also spoke back.

“Damn it, he really will throw us into the latrine! I was threatened once before!” But despite their shouts, the Heavens-Soaring Stone whispered to the Mountain-Sea Tree.

“What do we do? I’m still a child!”

“The only way to kill this old man is with that move!” The Mountain-Sea Tree quickly replied.

“Rubbish! No, I can’t use that move—it would damage my reputation!” A stone and a tree rapidly exchanged thoughts, while Tian Ming began attacking the first-generation ancestor’s ghostly form. His attacks were ruthless, making the ghostly form begin to flicker and fade.

“Why are you two just standing there? Do you really want to go into the latrine?” Luo Tian shouted at the Heavens-Soaring Stone, who was staring blankly. Even the Mountain-Sea Tree no longer obeyed the first-generation ancestor’s commands. He knew that for these two things, threatening them with a latrine was effective.

“Haha, friends of the Rising Dragon Sect, sorry we’re late!” After Luo Tian’s shout, a series of breaking sounds rose from the south of the Rising Dragon Sect. A stream of light rushed toward it, their power immense. The leader was none other than the missing Xuan Dan.

“Kill them all! My promise will be fulfilled!” Xuan Dan’s face was gloomy. Seeing Luo Tian and the Rising Dragon Sect disciples’ deaths, he ordered his forces.

“Master Xuan Dan!”

“Our reinforcements have arrived!” The Rising Dragon Sect disciples shouted, watching the figures. Their weakest was True Immortal Mid-stage, and there were a thousand of them—yet these thousand were all top-tier combat forces, even surpassing the four sects.

“Haha, Luo Tian, you bastard! You still use that Ten Thousand Heavens’ Divine Punishment Array well—damn, almost killed us! But I’m strong!” As Xuan Dan’s people arrived, a black cloud also rushed from the north of the Rising Dragon Sect.

Chapter 2237: Holding On ( )

Purple lightning flashed, a thin figure appearing in people’s sight. He stood with his hands behind his back, radiating an overwhelming aura—yet his purple eyes held a touch of loneliness. His gaze was deep, giving off an air of solitude.

“Enough! Stop!” A dignified voice echoed from the purple-robed youth, and even Tian Ming paused. He cautiously observed the youth, feeling an unusual sense of unease.

“Who are you?” Tian Ming felt strange; this youth’s aura was that of a strong person, yet his heart felt uneasy.

“Elder Brother!” As the purple-robed youth stood there, a black cloud drifted from afar. A group of familiar figures appeared in Luo Tian’s sight, making his face break into a smile and his heart calm.

Over twenty thousand people—though not perfectly aligned, they were orderly in chaos. Each figure radiated a powerful aura. The front figures included Nan Gong Yuqing, Li Tianzhi, Ren Hongzhe, and Long Jie, Wan Lingkong, among others. Luo Tian also spotted a few familiar faces in the crowd.

“Shura, Heaven’s Net!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with joy as he saw Shura and Heaven’s Net, who stood among the crowd like ordinary people.

“Haha, Luo Tian, long time no see! How have you been?” Heaven’s Net laughed and began speaking.

“I’m fine. First, help me deal with these people! Not the time for small talk!” Luo Tian interrupted Heaven’s Net, smiling. He looked at these people—his true brothers and the foundation of his strength.

“Brothers, kill!” Biao Dezhu shouted, waving his hand toward the battlefield.

But what awaited Biao Dezhu was silence; those people behind him didn’t move.

“Um… Six Brother, the Big Brother hasn’t given the order, so we dare not charge!” A big man stepped forward, scratching his head and speaking to Biao Dezhu.

“Damn it!” Biao Dezhu cursed, his aura dropping instantly, looking like a despicable person.

“Tricked! Dead!” Tian Ming cursed silently, leaping into the air toward the first-generation ancestor’s ghostly form.

The first-generation ancestor was now flickering and seemed on the verge of collapse, but as Tian Ming moved, Luo Tian also did. He activated the Yellow Spring Step and appeared before the first-generation ancestor, meeting Tian Ming’s golden sword.

“Crack…” Thunder flashed; Luo Tian’s body sank, and Tian Ming descended toward him.

“Luo Tian has gone变态 again!” Biao Dezhu watched Luo Tian, who was being suppressed but still fought against a Half-step Immortal King.

As Luo Tian and Tian Ming clashed again, the Rising Dragon Sect disciples and those brought by Xuan Dan rushed toward the four sects’ disciples.

This time, the Rising Dragon Sect’s people seemed to have had a surge of energy, their morale high.

“Brothers, kill!” Nan Gong Yuqing shouted to the twenty thousand people behind him, who had a bandit-like aura.

“Yes!” Hearing Nan Gong Yuqing’s words, the twenty thousand people—impatient for a long time—let out a roar and rushed into battle.

“This is the original Star River Four Bandits!” Luo Tian landed, but still divided his attention to the battlefield.

Nan Gong Yuqing’s group was similar to the original Star River Four Bandits, with a bandit-like aura. Obviously, Nan Gong Yuqing and his group hadn’t been idle these years.

The battlefield quickly turned one-sided; Nan Gong Yuqing’s twenty thousand people were exceptionally fierce, their combat power astonishing. Combined with the Rising Dragon Sect disciples’ morale, the four sects’ disciples quickly began to retreat.

“Kid, still have time to watch!” Tian Ming’s cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

*Boom, boom, boom…*

Tian Ming and the first-generation ancestor continued their clash, moving toward Luo Tian.

“You no longer have the right to be arrogant before me!” Luo Tian sneered, his hands moving as he unleashed the Path of Heaven and Humanity again. A golden dragon roared out, landing before Luo Tian as he descended.

The dragon’s might was overwhelming; the golden body soared, catching Luo Tian and then swinging its tail toward Tian Ming.

“Is this the power that Duan Fei had?” Tian Ming’s face shifted, sensing pressure and slowing down. At this moment, the golden dragon tail appeared before Tian Ming, making him curse but still managing to grab it with his strength.

“Boom…” The golden hand collided with the dragon tail, but the hand didn’t break—it grabbed the tail and swung it, sending the massive dragon body flying uncontrollably and collapsing a vast expanse of the sky.

“Clash…” Black blade energy rose, sending Luo Tian into solemnity. Nan Gong Yuqing held the Demon Sword and slashed toward Tian Ming.

Ren Hongzhe, Li Tianzhi, and others also launched their attacks, each powerful martial art shattering the sky toward Tian Ming.

Luo Tian’s face also showed a smile; his Dragon Abyss Sword radiated an overwhelming aura, drawing Luo Tian’s cultivation to unleash sword energy toward Tian Ming.

Tian Ming’s face was grim as he fought back, but with time passing, the pressure from Luo Tian’s Path of Heaven and Humanity lessened.

However, Li Tianzhi and others tightly surrounded Tian Ming; each martial art was strong, but Tian Ming’s strength was there. Though they couldn’t kill him, they made him look desperate.

Luo Tian roared and finally unleashed the Seven Steps of蛮, thundering as his black foot descended toward Tian Ming.

“Boom…” Tian Ming’s body violently shook, his hands forming a seal and conjuring a golden shield to block the black foot.

*Boom, boom, boom…*

Black foot images kept falling; in no time, Luo Tian had used the first three steps. Meanwhile, Nan Gong Yuqing and others unleashed overwhelming divine power, their powerful martial arts striking Tian Ming.

“Break!” Tian Ming’s face was grim; he felt a strong crisis, seeing each of the martial arts with overwhelming might. Even as a Half-step Immortal King, he had to be cautious.
