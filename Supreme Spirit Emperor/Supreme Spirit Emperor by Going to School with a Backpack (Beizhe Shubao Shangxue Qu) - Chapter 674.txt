The swords roared incessantly, waves of sword energy intertwining with one another, instantly surrounding Luo Tian and his companions. Overwhelming waves of sword energy surged forth, beginning to obliterate Luo Tian and his two allies.

Luo Tian and his companions remained solemn, each wave of sword energy radiating an aura that instilled fear.

They dared not hesitate; Luo Tian and his companions began colliding with the sword energy repeatedly, but the energy seemed to be endless, cycling endlessly without any discernible flaw.

Jiang Chen's face was pale, his body swaying as he watched the Supreme Heaven Sword Array exterminate Luo Tian and his companions. His breath was heavy, sweat streaming down his forehead, as if he might collapse at any moment. Clearly, this massive sword array had taken a heavy toll on Jiang Chen.

"Let's see if the Supreme Heaven Sword Array can eliminate them!" Jiang Chen murmured, regaining his composure as his hands radiated waves of energy.

"Impossible! If we continue like this, we'll be exhausted eventually. This sword array seems to be cyclical with no flaws!" Wang Gang shouted, their current struggle was merely exhausting. If prolonged, they would be in grave danger.

"Then how do we break through?" Wu Mian quickly exchanged thoughts with Luo Tian and Wang Gang, placing their hopes on Luo Tian. After all, Luo Tian had once been a cultivator of the celestial realm and had spent time in Supreme Heaven Mountain.

"I don't know, but we must break through!" Luo Tian replied, his words leaving Wu Mian and Wang Gang speechless.

"If we could break through, wouldn't we have already done so?" Wu Mian and Wang Gang thought internally.

"Focus your attacks there, and I'll handle the rest!" Luo Tian shattered a wave of sword energy with a punch, then pointed toward the center of the array. "Go!"

"Let's try!" Wu Mian and Wang Gang had no choice but to gamble. Wu Mian hurled his black spear, which transformed into a streak of light aimed at the array's core. Wang Gang also roared and launched a fist, striking a specific point.

"It's no use!" Jiang Chen observed their attacks against the Supreme Heaven Sword Array, believing it could contain Luo Tian and his companions for half an hour. Jiang Chen needed only a minute to recover, then with Ke Duanshan's help, they could eliminate Dou Tianming and turn the tide.

Boom...
As Jiang Chen sneered, Wu Mian and Wang Gang's attacks struck the Supreme Heaven Sword Array.

The thunderous sound shook heaven and earth, causing the array to tremble. Vast waves of sword energy were shattered by their assault, yet the array remained intact.

"Useless!" Wu Mian and Wang Gang panted, gazing at the array they had shaken.

A sudden surge of dark light appeared before the array, and a figure materialized there.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation!" A cold voice echoed, and Luo Tian raised his hand, striking the array with a punch.

One punch, imbued with an indescribable aura, darkened the heavens and twisted the winds. An enigmatic force clung to Luo Tian's fist.

Boom...
The thunderous sound echoed, and in Jiang Chen's disbelief, a vortex formed in the sky. In its distortion, waves of sword energy vanished from view.

"Breakthrough!" Wu Mian and Wang Gang rejoiced, leaping into the air toward Jiang Chen.

"How is this possible!" Jiang Chen gasped, his eyes wide with disbelief. He had invested so much in the Supreme Heaven Sword Array, yet it was shattered by Luo Tian's single punch.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation power!" Wu Mian and Wang Gang gasped, naturally having heard of the Six Paths of Reincarnation, a power belonging to the Black and White Impermanence. They never imagined Luo Tian would wield it.

One punch, this single strike utterly crushed Jiang Chen's hope and secured the victory for the Kamen Army.

"Supreme Heaven City, all troops retreat!" Jiang Chen roared, his voice laced with intense regret. However, his current state was weak; he could not match Luo Tian and his companions. He had no choice but to retreat.

"What?" Upon hearing Jiang Chen's words, the soldiers of Supreme Heaven City instantly felt a wave of sorrow.

"Retreat!"
"Retreat! Supreme Heaven City cannot be held!" Ke Duanshan also shouted, his voice laced with regret.

"Defeated!" At once, the soldiers of Supreme Heaven City broke and fled from the city.

"Who among my brothers wishes to hold the rear?" A half-Immortal King commander shouted, standing atop the sky, watching the hellish ghosts and creatures pouring into Supreme Heaven City.

"I... I..." Soldiers instantly stepped forward, standing behind the half-Immortal King commanders, glaring fiercely at the creatures entering Supreme Heaven City.

"Even you think to hold the rear? Stay behind and die!" Zhou Yuan and other half-Immortal Kings shouted, leading their subordinates into Supreme Heaven City.

"Go!" Jiang Chen urged Ke Duanshan, knowing they could not die; if they did, the remaining soldiers of Supreme Heaven City would lose their leader.

Their figures flickered as they fought and retreated into the city. Wu Mian and others would not let them escape easily.

"Brothers, chase after!" Wu Mian shouted; this was the best opportunity to annihilate Supreme Heaven City's forces, and he would not miss it.

"Yes!" Hellish ghosts swiftly occupied Supreme Heaven City while following Luo Tian and Wu Mian's group, pursuing the retreating soldiers of Supreme Heaven City.

In the dim space, several hellish elders sat waiting for news from the gate of hell.

"Haha! Supreme Heaven City has been taken!" As soon as Wu Mian sent a message to Black and White Impermanence upon the city's capture.

"Ah, Black and White, you've become so strong now, even the fifth!" Upon hearing Black and White's words, several palace masters sighed, making Black and White immensely proud.

Chapter 2522: Seizing Supreme Heaven City

"Kill!..." The cries of battle echoed to the heavens as hellish ghosts transformed into a flood, beginning to chase after the retreating soldiers of Supreme Heaven City.

"Is this the aura of the celestial realm? Indeed, it's far better than hell!" Hellish ghosts shouted as they rushed into Supreme Heaven City.

Supreme Heaven City was like a watershed, separating hell and the celestial realm. Now that it had been captured, hellish ghosts instantly felt the environment of the celestial realm was far superior to hell.

"Brothers, I'll hold the rear!" The commanders of Supreme Heaven City stood resolutely at the city's gates, their eyes filled with madness.

"Brothers, follow me!" A commander roared, and behind him, tens of thousands of soldiers also shouted. A tragic aura surged into the sky as ten thousand men charged fearlessly toward the hellish creatures.

"Self-destruct!" Without hesitation, the ten thousand men exploded, choosing the most direct method.

Boom... Boom...
The thunderous sounds echoed through heaven and earth, the heavens cracked, and the world trembled. Ten thousand men self-destructed in unison, creating a cataclysmic wave that swept across the battlefield. Vast numbers of hellish creatures were annihilated in the terrifying explosion, halting Kamen's army's pursuit.

Storms swept across the void, chaotic currents everywhere, making it impossible to cross until they calmed.

"Stop!" Kamen's commanders made their judgment, unwilling to make futile sacrifices. After all, they had lost three times as many men as Supreme Heaven City, suffering heavy losses.

The storm raged for a quarter of an hour before finally calming down. The walls of Supreme Heaven City were completely submerged, and many buildings within the city had collapsed into ruins.

"Kill! I want to see how many self-destructed!" After the storm calmed, several commanders issued orders again, shouting at hellish ghosts and creatures.

However, this time, only one hundred fifty thousand ghosts and creatures rushed out with those commanders; the rest remained in Supreme Heaven City, beginning to clear the battlefield.

Above the heavens, Luo Tian, Wu Mian, Wang Gang, and Dou Tianming continued to chase after Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan. They did not wish to let the two escape.

The four clashed, shaking the void. Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan fought and retreated, their condition was dire. Luo Tian's group was as tenacious as leeches.

They fought for thousands of miles, and Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan were covered in blood, their energy gradually weakening.

"Lord Commander, you go first; I'll hold them back!" Ke Duanshan shouted at Jiang Chen, whose face was pale.

"Duanshan!" Upon hearing Ke Duanshan's words, Jiang Chen's eyes showed emotion. He never expected Ke Duanshan to sacrifice himself for him now.

"I'm sorry, I feared you and thus oppressed you. If we must go, let's go together; even if you self-destruct, you can't stop them!" Jiang Chen spat blood, being sent flying thousands of feet by Luo Tian's punch.

"Not a single one will escape!" Wu Mian's cold voice echoed, his black spear like a snake clinging to Jiang Chen.

"Umi, don't force me to self-destruct!" Jiang Chen's eyes were fierce as he stared at Wu Mian, his mad voice causing Wu Mian and the others to pause slightly.

The self-destruction of a late-stage Immortal King would surely be apocalyptic; even if they blocked it, one or two of them might die.

"Let the defeated flee; we've already taken Supreme Heaven City. Next, it's ten thousand miles!" Wu Mian spoke, halting Luo Tian and the others.

Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan swayed as they flew into the distance, while Luo Tian's group returned to Supreme Heaven City.

The three moved like lightning and quickly returned to the city. Upon returning, Wu Mian immediately went to a temporary pavilion.

"Send messages to Zhou Yuan and others, telling them not to chase; they must return to Supreme Heaven City immediately!" Wu Mian quickly issued orders. If Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan left, and if hell's army pursued them, they might encounter Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan. Though wounded, they could still eliminate over a hundred thousand men.

"Let the entire army rest; repair Supreme Heaven City briefly, then plan further. Also, take control of all five million miles around it; if any faction resists, destroy them!"

"However, do not harm ordinary civilians!" Wu Mian continued issuing orders. The commanders' faces were weary but their eyes bright as they began to act.

Time passed slowly; Wu Mian continuously discussed the next steps for half an hour.

"Commander, we've returned!" As Wu Mian finished speaking, figures covered in blood appeared in the pavilion—those who had chased after Supreme Heaven City's soldiers.

"How did it go?" Wu Mian asked, needing to know how many remained in Supreme Heaven City to estimate future battles.

"They chased for three million miles, and they self-destructed twenty thousand times to block us. There are about fifty thousand left!"

"All half-Immortal Kings are gone; only remnants remain!" Zhou Yuan shouted, his body soaked in blood but his face filled with excitement. Supreme Heaven City had opposed them for years, and now it was finally taken. The most excited were those who had been stationed at Kamen.

"Understood, tally our casualties and then rest!" Wu Mian spoke.

"Sire, Heavenly King, you two should also rest; the next battle may be simpler. The Grandmaster's command is ten thousand miles. Once we understand this area, we'll push another ten thousand miles. The Wheel Turning Palace will surely send people to garrison!" Wu Mian instructed each commander, then turned to Luo Tian.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded and, with Wang Gang, stood up and exited the pavilion, stepping into Supreme Heaven City.

The entire city was in ruins, no longer resembling its former self. Hellish ghosts and commanders began to repair the city according to Wu Mian's instructions, not too thoroughly. Who knew if the celestial realm would reclaim Supreme Heaven City? They would only fully restore it once they were certain.

"War is truly cruel; in an instant, blood flows like rivers and corpses pile up!" Wang Gang and Luo Tian walked along the bloody, ruined streets.

"Indeed."

"One general's success is built on ten thousand bones; survival of the fittest. Isn't this the rule in hell? This rule applies everywhere!" Luo Tian nodded.

"If a sovereign appeared, the entire celestial realm and hell's structures would surely change!" Wang Gang said with admiration, a field he could never reach.

"This is beyond our control; I've always believed that protecting those we care about is enough!" Luo Tian softly sighed, parting from Wang Gang.

Luo Tian found a dilapidated courtyard and sat down, gazing at the ruined place. A familiar feeling arose in his heart.

At this moment, night had fallen; the soldiers still worked feverishly.

Luo Tian stood in the black night, suddenly feeling a sense of enjoyment. Perhaps it was because he had spent too long in hell; he had grown fond of standing in the darkness.

"First, recover my injuries!" Luo Tian sat cross-legged and began to heal from the wounds inflicted by Jiang Chen.

This night was destined to be turbulent, known to both the celestial realm and hell—eight gates of hell had failed.

In hell, a second batch was dispatched to the eight gates; after all, Kamen's army still needed to fight and occupy new territories. Meanwhile, the celestial realm was in upheaval; the loss of eight gates made hell's existence known to the entire celestial realm.

Those who knew about hell were shocked, for they had always seen it as a prison-like place, suppressed by the celestial realm.

On Supreme Heaven Mountain, several peak Immortal Kings gathered, hearing news from the front lines—eight cities had all fallen. Naturally, they received the message, and what surprised them most was one person's appearance—Luo Tian!

"Luo Tian, he's still alive!" The peak Immortal Kings' faces were filled with disbelief. They had seen him destroyed completely!

"What's the situation? How did he appear, and why is he attacking Supreme Heaven City!" The peak Immortal Kings spoke.

"Is this the change in the celestial realm?" The Ghost King Sect's Ghost King spoke, his voice cold.

"How did he survive that situation!" Other palace masters were also surprised.

"What do you think, Supreme Heaven King?" The peak Immortal Kings looked at Supreme Heaven King with mockery. After all, Supreme Heaven King had sacrificed everything to protect Luo Tian; now he was attacking Supreme Heaven City.

"Sit and watch!" Supreme Heaven King showed no emotion, speaking softly, making it impossible to read his thoughts.

"Bad! If Tianyuan Sect agrees to garrison hell, will they join Luo Tian!" A peak Immortal King spoke, his voice heavy.

The celestial realm was in a precarious situation; if Tianyuan Sect defected, it would be a disaster.

"No!"
"That kid must have been assimilated by hell or something happened; otherwise, he couldn't have survived that situation. If he truly valued sentiment, he wouldn't have attacked Supreme Heaven City!" Yongsheng Immortal King spoke coldly but was secretly excited.

"It's definitely the Book of Epochs!" Yongsheng Immortal King thought internally, desperately concealing his excitement.

"Tianyuan Sect has already set out; they only agreed to garrison Supreme Heaven City!"

"We can't push too hard!" Lingyao Immortal King spoke, sending his avatar to Tianyuan Sect to explain the negotiation results.

"It's better; if Luo Tian truly killed Tianyuan Sect's people, it would weaken their strength. The worst case is if Tianyuan Sect defects to hell!"

"It's impossible; Tianyuan Sect won't send everyone. Those remaining in the Middle Three Realms are the best hostages!" The peak Immortal Kings whispered among themselves.

Chapter 2523: Celestial Realm Reinforcements

Three days passed quietly; after Kamen's army repaired Supreme Heaven City, it had partially recovered. The army was stationed there for rest.

Not only that, but the five million miles around Supreme Heaven City were completely under Kamen's control after being ruthlessly crushed by hell's army.

In the pavilion, a group of people sat together.

"Commander, we currently have one hundred fifty thousand Heaven Realm cultivators, fifty thousand True Realm cultivators. There are about twenty-five thousand True Realm ghosts remaining!"

"There are also four half-Immortal Kings lost!" Zhou Yuan and other commanders reported the casualties to Wu Mian.

After this battle, the Wheel Turning Palace's people and Tian Gui Wang City's people had completed their integration and were incorporated into the army.

"The losses are quite heavy," Wu Mian sighed internally, though they had taken Supreme Heaven City, their losses were also significant.

"The Grandmaster's command is ten thousand miles; we still need five more. Leave fifty thousand disciples to garrison, and this afternoon the rest will continue fighting!"

"Once hell's reinforcements arrive, we can push further!" Wu Mian ordered, and the commanders accepted their commands, gathering their subordinates.

"Ten thousand miles should be relatively easy; the real challenge is how to hold these ten thousand miles and deal with the celestial realm's reinforcements. We don't know their exact numbers; if we knew how many came, it would be better to fight wisely." Wu Mian muttered. Knowing oneself and the enemy ensures victory in a hundred battles.

"Although we took Supreme Heaven City, our losses were heavy; the soldiers are still in high spirits. In such a short time, the celestial realm probably hasn't sent reinforcements yet!" Du Changming spoke, analyzing the situation.

"So we must act quickly; also pay attention to those in Supreme Heaven City and thoroughly clear them out. Changming, stay behind!" Wu Mian ordered.

"But what if we encounter Jiang Chen?" Du Changming asked; they were still most wary of Jiang Chen, a half-Immortal King who could turn the tide.

"Don't worry; Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan are severely wounded. The Sire can handle it!" Wu Mian replied; the previous battle was entirely Luo Tian's main force. If not for Luo Tian, the outcome would have been uncertain.

"Good!" Du Changming nodded without further words; he had seen the battle and was amazed by Luo Tian's combat power.

...
Beyond ten thousand miles of Supreme Heaven City, a massive city stood—Tianhun City. This was where Luo Tian had once met Run Hongyu and killed the city's master, Chen Tiancheng.

Tianhun City was the second line of defense for the celestial realm, though it had never been used. After Chen Tiancheng's death, the city's master was replaced; the new master was Yao Zhengqing, a True Realm peak.

He knew about the hellish war but Tianhun City's strength was far inferior to Supreme Heaven City.

At this moment, Tianhun City was bustling with people, appearing desolate; many residents had fled. Only the city's forces remained, unable to leave in time.

In the city lord's mansion, a middle-aged man in blue robes continuously directed people to move things, even neglecting the flowers and plants in the courtyard.

"I really have bad luck; I've only been city lord for a short time, and hell has already attacked!"

"Quickly! Speed up; when the hellish army arrives, no one can escape!" Yao Zhengqing cursed internally.

"City Lord Tianhun!" As Yao Zhengqing was moving things, a bloodthirsty aura suddenly surged into Tianhun City, causing its people to shudder.

"Run! Hellish creatures are coming!" The city's people immediately shouted, rushing toward the southern gate.

"Damn it! How fast!" Yao Zhengqing cursed and flew into the air, but a pressure immediately pressed down on him, making his body fall to the ground like a fly.

"Are you the city lord of Tianhun?" A cold voice echoed in Yao Zhengqing's ears, making his face pale with fear.

A group of bloodied people broke through the city gates and rushed into Tianhun City.

"You... you are..." Yao Zhengqing's face was filled with fear, staring at an old man in the sky who was covered in blood.

The old man had many wounds, some already scabbed over, but his eyes were red, and he panted heavily. His gaze fell on Yao Zhengqing.

"I am Jiang Chen!" The old man spoke, descending from the sky and looking at Yao Zhengqing. At the same time, soldiers with exhaustion blocked both city gates.

"Respect Supreme Heaven City Lord!" Yao Zhengqing didn't hesitate and immediately knelt down.

"You are fleeing? Hell's attack, this Tianhun City is the second line of defense. You didn't defend it and fled!" Jiang Chen's voice was angry, clearly audible to all.

"I dare not!" Yao Zhengqing's face immediately broke out in sweat; his status was far below Jiang Chen.

"You were already defeated, how could we resist!" Yao Zhengqing thought internally.

"Summon the people of Tianhun City!" Jiang Chen ordered, walking into the city lord's mansion with Ke Duanshan.

They entered the mansion, only two True Realm peak commanders followed them; after the previous battle, their commanders and company leaders had been severely wounded.

"City Lord, this Tianhun City may also be hard to hold!" Ke Duanshan spoke; they were now remnants, no match for hell.

"At least hold it; if Tianhun City falls too, then hell's army may march straight into the celestial realm!"

"Why haven't the reinforcements arrived yet!" Jiang Chen spoke solemnly; he also knew the situation. With their current strength, they couldn't hold Tianhun City, only hoping for reinforcements from Supreme Heaven Mountain to arrive quickly.

"They should be coming soon; the news said that middle three realms' sects have sent reinforcements. As for which sect, it's still unclear; if they come quickly, five days should be enough!" Ke Duanshan replied.

"Wait!" Jiang Chen sighed, his eyes flashing red briefly, which went unnoticed by Ke Duanshan. Jiang Chen seemed to have felt nothing.

Time passed slowly; two days had gone by, and the entire Tianhun City was on high alert. Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan's injuries had partially recovered, but both looked exhausted; their commanders and company leaders were gone, so they had to personally issue orders.

Two days later, the soldiers' conditions improved somewhat, but a sorrowful mood spread throughout Tianhun City.

A surge of energy appeared in the sky over Tianhun City, a powerful pressure causing Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan's faces to slightly change.

"Who is in charge of this Tianhun City? Come out!" A deep voice echoed over the city, four figures standing on its skyline gazing at the city.

"Beaten so badly!" A young man in white robes muttered, his aura of dragons giving him an imposing presence.

"Those nine mountain sects' bastards, they made us fight hell; even a fool could see it was to drain our strength!" A man in white robes spoke.

"Who are you?" Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan appeared, gazing at the four figures with immense energy. Though they were also early-stage Immortal Kings, their auras made Ke Duanshan feel pressure.

"Ten Yuan Sect, Long Jie! We've come to reinforce you!" A man in golden robes spoke, looking at the battered Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan.

"Reinforcements!"
"Ten Yuan Sect!" Upon hearing Long Jie's words, Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan's faces instantly brightened. They never expected reinforcements to arrive so quickly, especially from the first sect of the middle three realms—Ten Yuan Sect.

However, they immediately thought about Luo Tian's relationship with Ten Yuan Sect; they knew that Ten Yuan Sect had become this way because of Luo Tian's death.

"Welcome four, please come in; where are the disciples of Ten Yuan Sect?" Jiang Chen greeted them with a bow.

"We four are the reinforcements!" A voice filled with battle spirit and confidence echoed, it was Yao Chen.

The four who arrived were Long Jie, Yao Chen, Chen Zhanbiao, and Run Hongyu. Indeed, Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chen were battle enthusiasts; upon hearing they would fight, their eyes turned green like wolves.

"Four..." Upon hearing Yao Chen's words, Jiang Chen was slightly stunned; he never expected reinforcements to be only four people.

"An army is behind us; Ten Yuan Sect's two million disciples, we came ahead to ensure you could hold out!" Long Jie spoke, causing Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan's hearts to rejoice. Two million disciples would definitely be able to hold Tianhun City, and with four early-stage Immortal Kings, it would change the battlefield's momentum.

But they were puzzled as to why Ten Yuan Sect had sent people; if Ten Yuan Sect suddenly defected, what would they do?

Boom...
As Jiang Chen settled Long Jie and the others, a series of thunderous sounds echoed outside Tianhun City, cold energy sweeping across heaven and earth.

"So fast? They don't want us to catch our breath!" Jiang Chen's face slightly changed, sensing the city's defense array had activated.

"Report, Lord City Lord! Hellish ghosts and creatures have stationed outside the city; there are about two hundred thousand ghosts!" A company leader entered, reporting to Jiang Chen.

"What do we do? How can we resist now!" The soldiers of Tianhun City instantly felt despair.

"Follow me out to fight them!" Jiang Chen spoke, slowly standing up and gazing at Long Jie and the others. "This time, I'll trouble you four!"

"Good!" Long Jie nodded and followed Yao Chen and the others, walking out of Tianhun City with Jiang Chen.

Countless armies appeared outside Tianhun City, ten thousand miles away; Wu Mian, Luo Tian, and Wang Gang stood at the front of the army.
