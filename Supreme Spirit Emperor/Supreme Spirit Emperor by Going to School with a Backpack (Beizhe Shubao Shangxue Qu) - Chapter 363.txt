The human clan watched the arrogant Qiyuan with growing chaos, but the elder generation's strong warriors could not bring themselves to confront him. The younger generation knew Sun Junliang's strength and admitted they could not match him. Seeing Qiyuan's aura, it was clearly aimed at killing Sun Junliang; otherwise, Sun Miechen's timely intervention would have left Sun Junliang dead.

“How? The human clan has no one left?” Qiyuan stood atop the arena, surveying the human faction with disdain before shaking his head.

“Haha! Indeed weak—unable to even defeat Qiyuan!” The Ancient Clan's faction wore mocking expressions, while some stronger young warriors among them shouted with contempt.

“Damn it! Our Four Sacred Star Domain's prodigies were taken by your demon clan. If one of them were here, they’d shut you up!” Xu Liziyi and others bellowed without regard for their status, shouting at Qiyuan.

“Humans are destined to be weak—even if they were here, I’d still crush them!” Qiyuan sneered, countering fiercely. He dismissed Xu Liziyi’s late Epoch-level cultivation entirely, knowing that if they fought, the clan would also send elders.

“Who said Nine Domains have no one?” As the human faction seethed, a cold voice echoed through the stars. A slender figure soared from the distant cosmos—a woman in her twenties, landing on the arena with a faint smile.

“Who is this? I feel like I’ve seen her before?” Diao Dedu and others blinked in confusion, murmuring.

“She’s too familiar… but why can’t I recall?” Zheng Xin and others stared intently at the girl on the arena, straining to remember.

Chapter 1455: Luo Xiting (Luo Xiting)

“Who is this girl?” All eyes turned to the twenty-something woman on the arena.

She had clear brows and bright teeth, her slender frame exuding beauty—especially her deep-set eyes that drew one into their abyss.

“Little sister, who are you?” Qiyuan smiled, his gaze flickering with admiration. Though opposed to the human clan, he felt no hostility toward this girl.

“How old are you? Which Holy Sect do you belong to? Are you betrothed?” Qiyuan’s eyes gleamed as he asked.

“I am no one important—just a disciple of an ordinary sect in Nine Domains, not even a Holy Sect!” The girl’s face was cold. She waved her hand, and a green sword materialized in her grip, radiating icy aura.

“Then it’s settled!” Qiyuan scanned the human clan before declaring, “I claim this girl. If her sect wishes to challenge me, they may come to the Qilin Clan. I promise: when the Ancient Clan flattens Holy Sects, we will not invade your sect!”

“What a lowly thing! Just because you speak so, do you think we’ll hold back?” A youth with three pairs of wings scoffed.

“Exactly! She’s mine—no one else dares challenge me!” Other Ancient Clan prodigies chimed in, all entranced by the girl on the arena.

“Enough talk. To marry me, you must ask my father’s permission!” The girl’s cold gaze bore into Qiyuan and the Ancient Clan prodigies, her eyes flashing murder.

“Your father? A mere sect master! Don’t worry—I’m sure he’ll agree!” Qiyuan sneered. Even Holy Sect leaders were beneath him, let alone this girl’s small sect.

“My father is Luo Tian!” The girl’s words silenced everyone, their eyes widening in disbelief.

“Luo… Luo Tian!” Diao Dedu and others gaped, their faces lighting up with joy.

“Ah! It’s Xiting!” Zheng Xin and others leapt into the air, surrounding the girl.

“Xiting niece! I knew she looked familiar!” Zheng Xin laughed heartily—Luo Xiting was his chosen daughter-in-law.

Diao Dedu and Xu Liziyi’s faces also lit up as they gazed at the grown woman on the arena, ignoring the other clans and humans.

“Luo Tian’s daughter?” The human clan marveled, knowing Luo Tian had a daughter. But when Luo Xiting left with Gu Tianshu years ago, she was just a child; the recent dominance of Luo Li and others had made people forget about Luo Tian’s daughter.

“Uncles, are you all well?” Seeing Zheng Xin, Luo Xiting’s cold expression softened into a smile.

“Good! Good! Why didn’t you say you were coming? You ended up here!” They beamed, forgetting the arena’s significance.

“Luo… Luo Tian…” Qiyuan stood frozen, his face darkening. For days, the name “Luo Tian” had echoed most—humanity’s top prodigy, unshakable across Nine Domains.

“Hey! If you want to chat, go down below—don’t block our way!” The crowd growled as Diao Dedu and others lingered on the arena.

“Complaining? This is your home?” Zheng Xin and others shot back, unyielding.

“Curse you! I know you—Four Sacred Star Domain, get down!” A few Ancient Clan warriors barked.

“Liar! I’ll stay here—what can you do?” Zheng Xin and others defiantly replied. They had no fear, especially with backing from domain masters like Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Uncles, go down—after I kill these people, I’ll avenge you!” Luo Xiting knew her uncles’ temperaments. She smiled at Zheng Xin and others before descending the arena.

“Alright, Xiting—don’t hold back! That dog already used his killer move; just kill him!” Zheng Xin urged, concern in his voice as he called Qiyuan a “dog.”

“Understood, Uncle!” Luo Xiting nodded, sending Zheng Xin and Gu Lei down before turning to Qiyuan with a cold gaze.

“Little beauty, I didn’t expect you to be Luo Tian’s daughter. If I took you, Luo Tian would surely be delighted—win-win! Do you agree?” Qiyuan smiled, addressing her.

“Die!” Luo Xiting’s eyes flashed cold as she raised her sword, its green aura humming. A blade of light shot toward Qiyuan.

“Hmph!” Qiyuan’s face darkened, surprise flickering—how could this delicate girl be so powerful?

Qiyuan leapt back, dodging her strike. But as he moved, the green blade struck at an odd angle, slicing through him.

“Damn!” Qiyuan’s face paled as he unleashed his true form, a massive green qilin.

“Gah…” A low roar echoed across the arena as blood stained it, and Qiyuan’s limbs were severed.

“Thud…” The colossal body fell to the arena, its eyes wide with disbelief.

“The rumors were true—Luo Tian’s son was strong, but his daughter is equally formidable!” The crowd marveled at Luo Xiting standing on the arena.

“Family of freaks!” Human clan members sighed, recalling Luo Tian’s bizarre family.

The qilin reformed swiftly, lunging at Luo Xiting with fury.

“Die!” The sword spun again; Luo Xiting remained calm, her green blade slicing through Qiyuan’s body. This time, Qiyuan was pierced through, screaming as his body radiated divine patterns, blood spilling endlessly.

“Gah!” Qiyuan’s face contorted with fear as his life force vanished.

“Uncles, save me!” Qiyuan roared toward the Ancient Clan.

“Luo Tian’s daughter?” Before his words faded, a cold voice echoed—black hands snatched Qiyuan back.

“Qilin Clan’s Celestial Qilin, Qi Zi’ang?” People turned to see a black-cloaked figure, their faces stunned.

“Hmph, truly formidable!” Fuxingyue stood among the Ancient Clan, eyes mocking as he recalled Luo Tian’s past dominance over them.

“Blackie, who are you eyeing? A late Epoch-level warrior challenging a novice?” Diao Dedu and others, unafraid of Qi Zi’ang’s killing intent, shouted.

“Blackie…” People grimaced, admiration in their eyes.

“Blackie—sounds like a dog’s name!”

“Only the human clan would dare call a Qilin Clan leader ‘Blackie’!” Human members murmured.

“You think your Luo Tian protects you? I fear no one!” Qi Zi’ang’s face darkened, eyes burning with murder.

“Hmph, a traitor of the Beast Clan! What right do you have to swagger before us?” Long Jie stepped forward, his aura oppressive as he glared at Qi Zi’ang.

“Dragon Clan! Dragon Emperor!” People cheered, thrilled to witness a domain master’s clash.

“Dragon Clan, will you fight me?” Qi Zi’ang’s black aura surged as he faced Long Jie. Though Qilin Clan was deemed a traitor, history lingered—this feud with the Beast Clan was ancient.

“Don’t insult me!” Long Jie sneered, crossing his arms.

“What did you say?” Qi Zi’ang glared, his aura rising as he approached.

“Fine, I’ll settle this later!” Long Jie’s voice echoed in Luo Xiting’s mind as he nodded.

“Let the young ones fight first—our turn will come!” Long Jie addressed Qiyuan before leaping off the arena with Diao Dedu.

Qi Zi’ang, bound by status, could not attack Luo Xiting immediately, his face dark as he descended.

“Any more challengers?” Luo Xiting smiled, scanning the Ancient Clan’s youth.

Chapter 1456: Can You Touch My Daughter?

“Arrogant!” The Ancient Clan roared, angering at Luo Xiting’s words.

“Unexpectedly arrogant—your daughter is just as bold!” Fuxingyue smiled, silencing a Star Moon Sect prodigy.

“Earlier, you all were so bold—come on! I’m right here—one by one or all at once!” Luo Xiting’s aura shook the heavens, her gaze mocking.

“Foolish girl, I’ll teach you!” A feathered clan prodigy with three pairs of wings soared onto the arena, charging at Luo Xiting.

“Chen Uncle, I’ll give you six wings! I heard feathered clan’s wings are their essence—delicious too!” Luo Xiting spotted Chen Zhanbiao in the crowd, then swung her sword.

“Pfft…” The feathered prodigy fell from the sky, his wings floating before Luo Xiting snatched them and handed them to Chen Zhanbiao.

“Haha, I’m a bit hungry—this’ll do!” Chen Zhanbiao chuckled, igniting flames to roast the wings.

“Ah, if my brother were here, his fire would be better!” Chen Zhanbiao sighed, watching the wings sizzle.

“Brutal!” People gaped as Chen Zhanbiao roasted the wings before the feathered clan.

Yet, they were more stunned by Luo Xiting’s power—she had struck only three times against Qiyuan and the feathered prodigy, each strike crippling them.

“Luo Xiting’s Soul-Perceiving Eye always finds the enemy’s weakness—this alone is divine!” Zheng Xin sighed, recalling his past ambush.

“Did you notice she also wields Brahma Attack? That’s beyond late Epoch!” Diao Dedu marveled.

“By strength alone, she’s the strongest among these youths!” Long Jie nodded, satisfaction in his eyes.

“Any more?” Luo Xiting stood on the arena, her robes fluttering, exuding an ethereal aura—radiant as a celestial goddess.

The Ancient Clan’s prodigies fell silent; they knew Qiyuan and the feathered prodigy’s strength. Even the strongest dared not claim victory over them.

“Luo Tian is a freak, and his daughter’s equally terrifying! How can they leave any chance for others?” Human clan members muttered, yet their eyes glowed with hope. Watching the Ancient Clan’s former taunts now silenced was exhilarating.

“Or all together!” Luo Xiting declared, her sword dancing.

“Damn foolish girl!” A prodigy glared at Luo Xiting, stunned by a human’s audacity. Women in the Ancient Clan were mere accessories—few held dominance.

“Let’s fight together, though it’s unfair. We can’t let this human provoke us!” The Ancient Clan prodigies leapt onto the arena, eyes fierce.

“Come on!” Luo Xiting faced their auras without fear, her hands moving.

“Buzz…” Green swords hovered above her head, splitting into two, then four… The arena was soon swathed in floating swords.

“Go!” Luo Xiting’s sweat dripped, her effort evident as she spat blood into the swords.

“Infinite Sword Array!” She whispered, pressing her hands to the arena.

“Crash…” The swords surged toward the Ancient Clan prodigies, piercing them. Blood misted the arena as screams echoed.

“Unbelievable!” People marveled at Luo Xiting’s power, stunned by her delicate appearance.

“Why does this girl feel more ruthless than Luo Tian?” Zheng Xin trembled, pitying his son if he married her.

“Enough!” The Ancient Clan’s elders could no longer endure, watching prodigies slaughtered like chickens. If prolonged, none would survive—some had already died twice.

“Despicable humans! You seek death!” A mid-Epoch elder of the Celestial Angle Clan roared, rushing at Luo Xiting. His hand凝聚, striking her.

“Who do you think you are? Everyone dares to touch!” Long Jie, ever vigilant of Luo Xiting’s safety, spat a golden dragon that flew toward the elder.

But someone moved faster than Long Jie—a white light streaked through space, arriving at the mid-Epoch elder.

“Boom…” Blood misted as the elder was obliterated, his body reduced to a blood cloud.

Black hair flew, his aura fierce.

“My daughter—can you touch her?” Cold words echoed through the stars, chilling the Ancient Clan.

The elder was later annihilated by Long Jie’s dragon aura.

“Dad!” Luo Xiting smiled, rushing into the figure’s arms, her eyes filled with longing.

“Brat! Where have you been for years? You never returned!” Luo Tian smiled, patting his daughter’s head.

“Training!” She replied, then glanced at the fallen Ancient Clan prodigies with pride.

“Fighting isn’t your job!” Luo Tian glanced at the carnage, reprimanding.

“Luo Tian!” All gasped, staring at his overwhelming aura.

“Luo Tian!” The Ancient Clan’s prodigies seethed, recalling when Luo Tian crushed them. Though he hadn’t used human form then, his return to Seven Star Island as a clan heir made them aware of Fu Mengchen’s human identity.

“Go, leave the rest to me. No more fighting—act like a girl!” Luo Tian scolded, though his daughter’s strength was undeniable.

“Okay!” Luo Xiting stuck out her tongue, following Luo Tian toward Diao Yuanshan.

Hearing his words, Nine Domains’ people grimaced—Luo Tian’s record was legendary. Countless had died by his hand, including Holy Sects’ disciples.

“Big brother, come quick! Help me roast these wings—my fire’s no good!” Chen Zhanbiao called to Luo Tian, who laughed with the crowd.

“Haha!” They all chuckled, nostalgia in their eyes—this reunion was long overdue.

“Grandfather Gu is still alive?” As Luo Tian stepped off the arena, he asked Luo Xiting about Gu Tianshu.

“Still alive! Maybe you’ll meet him soon!” She smiled.

“Really?” Luo Tian and Gu Lei were stunned, joy in their eyes.

“What’s Grandfather Gu’s cultivation?” Luo Tian asked, echoing Gu Lei’s question.

“Dad, you’ll know when you meet him!” She smiled mischievously.

“Brat! You even hide it from your father!” Luo Tian smacked her head, sighing. As long as Gu Tianshu lived, it was enough.

“Luo Tian! Dare to fight me?” Qi Zi’ang glared, stepping onto the arena.

“Let me handle him!” Golden Sun Clan’s Jinyang, eyes burning with vengeance, stepped forward.

“Is Meng Huan here?” Luo Tian ignored the crowd’s demands, staring at the Ancient Clan.

“Not yet! But I want to see your so-called human prodigy’s strength!” A gray-cloaked elder stepped onto the arena, eyes on Luo Tian. This was Meng Chen, a contemporary genius of the Demon Clan.

“Demon Clan?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold as he asked.

“Yes!” Meng Chen crossed his arms, challenging.

Chapter 1457: You Are to Die

“Demon Clan deserves death!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he rushed at Meng Chen, his fist piercing space.

“Luo Tian! My opponent is me!” Qi Zi’ang roared, black aura surging as he blocked Luo Tian’s path. His hand struck.

“Move!” Luo Tian snorted, changing his fist’s direction to clash with Qi Zi’ang.

“Crack!” A thunderous sound echoed as they collided, space cracking.

Simultaneously, both retreated—Luo Tian stood firm while Qi Zi’ang spat blood, his face pale and body cracking.

“Gasps…” The stars echoed with gasps as people stared at Luo Tian, stunned by his might.

“Damn!” Qi Zi’ang’s face darkened, retreating millions of miles before stopping.

“Luo Tian!” Nine Domains roared, eyes wild with admiration for the godlike Luo Tian.

“Epoch Late!” Sun Miechen and others stood, faces bitter—after returning to their clan, they’d reached Epoch Late. Yet Luo Tian had matched them without lag.

“Damn… a freak!” Yan Hongtao muttered, bitterness in his voice.

“He’s still the same Luo Tian!” Fuxingyue smiled, recalling past encounters with him.

The Ancient Clan trembled at Luo Tian’s might, their eyes filled with awe. Who was Qi Zi’ang? A prodigy of the Ancient Clan, once boasting to fight Long Jie. Now, he was crushed by Luo Tian’s single punch.

“You’re not my match!” Luo Tian sneered, then leapt off the arena, charging at Meng Chen.

“Impossible!” Meng Chen’s mind raced—this Luo Tian was beyond his strength, even at Epoch Late.

Jinyang, Fan Jingyu, and others’ faces changed—though they believed themselves stronger than Qi Zi’ang, none could match Luo Tian. They retreated to observe his power.

“Damn!” Meng Chen realized their plan but was too late—his body recoiled as he faced Luo Tian.

Boom! Luo Tian, like a primordial beast, appeared before Meng Chen, his punch striking again. Simple yet devastating.

Meng Chen gritted his teeth, channeling all his power into gray aura, forming seals on his arms. He clashed with Luo Tian.

Thunder crackled as Meng Chen was sent flying, but Luo Tian kept advancing.

“I’ll fight you!” Meng Chen roared, his wounds healing as he faced Luo Tian’s relentless assault.

“Boom… boom…” The arena trembled with their clashes, the stage floating in the stars.

Luo Tian’s blood and qi surged, his body invincible. His six轮回不死身 (Reincarnation Immortal Bodies) glowed, and with two great arts, he was unstoppable. Meng Chen’s attacks were futile as blood spewed from his mouth.

“Who can match Luo Tian?” Human clan members cheered, roaring at the invincible Luo Tian.

Meng Chen, a Demon Clan genius, was formidable but no match for Luo Tian. Though he suffered, he couldn’t be killed by Luo Tian’s blows.

“Don’t use the Demon King Seal!” Meng Chen retreated, seizing a moment to escape Luo Tian’s relentless assault. His hands moved swiftly, forming a gray seal.

“Boom!” The stars cracked as the gray seal descended on Luo Tian.

“Is this a technique?” Luo Tian grabbed, his white Dao Map flying out, heavy and pressing against the seal.

“Crack!” Space rippled as waves spread.

“Severing Heaven Seal!” Luo Tian, determined to kill Meng Chen, raised his hands. A golden vortex formed above him, absorbing heaven’s power.

“Another technique!” The Ancient Clan gasped at the golden vortex engulfing space.

“That’s the strongest of the Three Severing Heavens!” Tu Feiyang gritted his teeth, recalling Luo Tian’s past.

“Boom…” The golden seal hovered above the stars, its power overwhelming. Meng Chen’s face paled.

“Demon God’s Sigh!” Meng Chen’s eyes flashed madness, his body channeling all power. A gray figure materialized behind him, towering and fierce.

“Crush!” Luo Tian pressed his hands down, the golden seal roaring toward Meng Chen.

“Brahma Attack! One strike defeats all!” Luo Tian’s finger tapped, reciting the Feihua Scripture. The seal absorbed his power and a white dragon pattern merged into it.

The combined arts unleashed an overwhelming aura, the seal expanding with terrifying power. All gasped in fear.

“If struck, death is certain!” The Ancient Clan trembled, eyes wide at the seal’s might.

“Damn!” Meng Chen paled, staring at the seal.

“Spit…” Blood erupted from his mouth, merging into the gray figure behind him.

“Buzz…” Red light flickered as the demon god’s shadow gained life, its eyes turning blood-red. It raised hands to heaven.

“Boom…” The golden seal struck the demon god’s shadow, the stars exploding with thunderous sound. The massive arena plummeted into space.

“How is it?” People gasped, watching the arena vanish in gray mist.

“What else? Bury Meng Chen!” Diao Dedu and others sneered at the Ancient Clan.

Gray mist churned, revealing the arena. Luo Tian stood coldly, blood spilling from his foot, gray mist swirling in the air.

“Sizzle…” Seven-colored flames rose from Luo Tian’s hands, burning the blood.

“You dare!” A cold voice echoed as an old man emerged from space, his gray hand pressing with overwhelming power toward Luo Tian.

“Demon Clan’s Epoch Peak master!” People guessed his identity, gasping.

“Demon Clan—deserve death!” Luo Tian ignored the hand’s might, forming a white palm to clash.

“My heavens! Luo Tian dares fight an Epoch Peak master—how can he survive?” People marveled again.

“Die!” The Demon Clan’s Epoch Peak master sneered, flying toward Luo Tian.

“Destroy him!” Luo Tian sneered, waving his hand. A gray mist shot from his palm, a withered figure rushing toward the master.
