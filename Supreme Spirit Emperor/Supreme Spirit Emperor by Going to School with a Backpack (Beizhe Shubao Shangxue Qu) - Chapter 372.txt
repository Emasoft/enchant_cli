“Hōng...” As Fu Xingyue's words fell, the Star Moon Guards erupted into chaos. A torrent of gazes turned toward Luo Tian, their eyes filled with disbelief.

The Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards had not appeared for a long time. Since that person's departure, the position had remained vacant, even eluding Fu Zhiming, who was most qualified. The Star Moon Guards knew this was tied to the legendary feats of that past commander, and partly due to the new Divine Emperor of the Star Moon Clan.

Moreover, the Star Moon Guards had long accepted the absence of a Grand Commander. The reverence for Luo Tian's past authority was unmatched among them.

Now, Fu Xingyue had brought an unfamiliar man to be their commander, stirring unease within them.

"Second Prince, I refuse! Why should this man be our Grand Commander? He hasn't even been a Deputy Commander! What right does he have?" A burly youth's face bore resentment.

"Reckless! Do you think because you're an old guard of the Star Moon Guards, I won't deal with you? This is a decision made by me and the Divine Emperor. Obey!" Fu Xingyue barked at the youth.

Luo Tian's gaze met the youth's, a faint smile playing on his lips. He recognized this man—his past as a thorn in the side and his upright nature remained vivid in his memory.

"Second Prince, your words hold truth. Please reconsider," echoed the voices of elder guards as Fu Xingyue's statement resounded, their faces still bearing defiance. Their continued use of "Second Prince" for Fu Xingyue revealed their deep-rooted respect within the Star Moon Guards.

"Are you questioning my decision?"

"Don't think these years of indulgence and tolerance have made you bold enough to defy me!" Fu Xingyue coldly snorted, her voice laced with chill.

Upon hearing Fu Xingyue's words, the Star Moon Guards fell silent, yet their eyes still held defiance as they gazed at her.

"Commander, why? You know the prestige of Dream Morning Commander!" As tension thickened, a figure descended from the sky, his expression respectful—Fu Zhiming, the Deputy Commander of the Star Moon Guards, just returned from the Netherworld's entrance.

"Yes! This Grand Commander should be a Deputy Commander!" Upon hearing Fu Zhiming's words, the Star Moon Guards murmured again.

"What qualifications do you believe are necessary to become Grand Commander?" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the crowd with a slight frown on Fu Xingyue's face.

"Among the Ancient Clans, strength is paramount. We Star Moon Guards are no different. Prove your might, and we shall submit!" Ge Erniu spoke again, his voice booming.

"And how do I prove my strength?" Luo Tian softly asked, his smile undiminished as he gazed at Ge Erniu.

"Ah?" Upon Luo Tian's gaze, Ge Erniu instinctively trembled. This shudder was almost reflexive.

"Kill a few human clan prodigies!" Ge Erniu shouted directly, his eyes filled with disdain.

"..." The crowd was speechless at Ge Erniu's audacity, treating human prodigies as mere chickens to be slaughtered.

"I can also prove my strength!" Luo Tian leapt down from the platform, standing before the Star Moon Guards.

"I shall seal my cultivation. Any one of you who defeats me, and I shall not be Grand Commander!" A sly smile graced Luo Tian's face as he sought to gauge the Star Moon Guards' current progress.

"Too bold! I, Old Ox, am the first to refuse!" Ge Erniu's eyes gleamed as he stared at Luo Tian.

"Good, start with you!" Luo Tian said, his hands moving swiftly. A cascade of talismans erupted from his palms, wrapping around his body with a resonant sealing power.

"嗡..." At the same time, Luo Tian's aura gradually descended. Under the Star Moon Guards' watchful eyes, it dropped to the Boundary Lord Realm.

"Boundary Lord?" The Star Moon Guards' eyes widened in surprise, astonished by Luo Tian's confidence.

The Star Moon Guards who had entered the Netherworld were elite among elites. The least was a Transcendent Realm cultivator; Ge Erniu, for instance, had reached the middle of the Saintly Realm. One could easily sweep through a group of Boundary Lords.

Though Luo Tian's manifested cultivation was the early era, sealing it to the Boundary Lord Realm still seemed overconfident.

"Come on!" Luo Tian's smile remained as he beckoned Ge Erniu, unconcerned by the Star Moon Guards' astonished glances.

"Commander!" Upon seeing Luo Tian truly challenging Ge Erniu in the Boundary Lord Realm, Fu Zhiming's expression shifted. His gaze met Fu Xingyue's—after all, this was Fu Xingyue's man. If Ge Erniu, the brash fool, injured him, Fu Xingyue's face would be ruined.

"Nothing. Watch the show!" Fu Xingyue lightly shook her head, a smile on her face as she sat down.

"Good lad! Just for your courage, if you defeat me, I'll acknowledge you!" Ge Erniu looked at Luo Tian and shouted loudly before pushing off the ground, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Crack..." A crisp sound rose from Ge Erniu's feet. He charged toward Luo Tian with a fierce aura.

"Still the same!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He had known Ge Erniu before and even guided his cultivation. Thus, he knew Ge Erniu's tactics—relying solely on brute force to ram opponents.

As Luo Tian sighed, Ge Erniu reached his front. His robust physique radiated an immense aura, about to collide with Luo Tian.

Luo Tian did not evade. Though his cultivation had dropped, his body remained invincibly strong; he stood there as if unaware of Ge Erniu's approach.

"Is this man too confident? His cultivation has dropped to the Boundary Lord Realm, yet he dares to face Ge Erniu head-on?" The Star Moon Guards murmured as they watched Luo Tian standing there.

"Crack..." Thunderous sounds erupted. An invisible gust of air formed around Luo Tian as Ge Erniu's body collided with him, producing a crisp sound.

Moments later, the Star Moon Guards widened their eyes in disbelief. Their vision saw Ge Erniu's robust body, arriving fast and departing faster, like a kite with its string cut, flying backward. A series of cracks echoed from his body.

Yet Luo Tian remained calm and composed, a playful smile on his face as he softly said, "Is this the Star Moon Guards?"

"Boom..." Ge Erniu fell to the ground with a heavy thud, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"How is this possible!" Ge Erniu's mind was stunned. But soon, he heard Luo Tian's mocking words about the Star Moon Guards and his eyes flashed with anger. He leapt up.

"You use the early era's body to call it a talent!" Though Ge Erniu was straightforward, he wasn't foolish. He suspected Luo Tian had used the early era's body to crush him.

"Fine, I won't use the early era's body!" Luo Tian sighed slightly. He wasn't intimidated by Ge Erniu's trick, standing there and beckoning again.

"Ahh..." Seeing Luo Tian's disdainful gaze, Ge Erniu erupted into fury. His eyes turned red as starlight talismans burst from his body, inscribing onto his form.

"Boom..." Ge Erniu this time didn't care about anything. He unleashed his full strength. Even if Luo Tian was Fu Xingyue's man, he would make Luo Tian suffer for insulting the Star Moon Guards.

Ge Erniu, true to his name, charged like a mad bull, becoming a streak of light as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

"It's the Shattered Star Ram! When they attacked the Thunder Domain, Ge Erniu used this move to kill many early Saintly Realm cultivators!" The Star Moon Guards, watching the mad Ge Erniu, gasped and turned to Fu Xingyue. Seeing her still smiling and seated there, they calmed down.

"Why is he so calm?" However, soon the Star Moon Guards saw Luo Tian still smiling as he stood there.

As people were stunned, Ge Erniu's figure approached Luo Tian again. Then the Star Moon Guards all fell silent in disbelief.

In their vision, Luo Tian moved with an eerie speed, dodging Ge Erniu's collision path. His hand landed on Ge Erniu's neck, pressing down with a firm grip. Ge Erniu's mighty figure seemed to deflate like a deflated balloon, being pressed onto the ground by Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The robust body was directly pressed to the ground, causing Ge Erniu to crash face-first.

"This..." Though Ge Erniu was pressed onto the ground, his eyes were filled with shock. He even forgot to spit out the soil in his mouth.

"Life Gate!" Ge Erniu's mind was stunned. He couldn't believe that Luo Tian had directly pressed his Life Gate.

"Spit..." Ge Erniu spat out the soil in his mouth, then muttered lowly: "How is this possible? How could you know!"

Ge Erniu couldn't believe that someone who knew the location of his Life Gate in the Shattered Star Ram was no more than five people across the entire Star Moon Divine Clan. He couldn't believe that this unfamiliar man, upon their first encounter with his martial art, had found the location of his Life Gate.

"You're still far from it! Remember to use Saintly Energy to冲击 the Wind Pool穴 during your cultivation. Once you open this point, your weakness will naturally disappear!" Luo Tian softly spoke, releasing Ge Erniu. He then cast a glance over the Star Moon Guards.

"I submit. This is the second time I've met someone who found my weakness!" Ge Erniu nodded, then stood up and walked into the crowd.

"Who else refuses?" Luo Tian smiled. He had guided Ge Erniu before, so he knew the location of his Life Gate. At that time, he had warned him, but obviously, Ge Erniu had ignored it.

"I!" As Luo Tian's words fell, a somewhat thin Star Moon Guard stepped forward, his eyes filled with battle intent.

"Come on!" Luo Tian still beckoned. This youth, Luo Tian also recognized—those who had followed him before had grown significantly in strength, becoming top-tier within the Star Moon Guards.

"Beware. I'm not like that bull. I specialize in speed!" The youth's face was indifferent as he moved, vanishing from his original spot and instantly appearing behind Luo Tian.

"Che!" Luo Tian chuckled softly, as if he had already known the youth's position. At the moment the youth moved, Luo Tian turned around and caught the youth's arm. He then shot a golden light from his hand, directly piercing into the youth's solar plexus.

"Boom..." The youth soon followed Ge Erniu's fate, his head hitting the ground and falling before Luo Tian.

"Next!" Luo Tian spoke again amidst the crowd's shock.

"I refuse!"

"Boom..."

"I also refuse... and me..."

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Luo Tian, as if possessing a divine eye, precisely found each opponent's weakness and subdued them.

One by one, the Star Moon Guards stared in disbelief as they lay on the ground, gazing at Luo Tian standing there.

"How is this possible!" Fu Zhiming's face was stunned. He also looked at Luo Tian, surprised that he could precisely find each opponent's weakness and subdue them. Such a feat was even beyond his own abilities.

"Commander, who is he?" Fu Zhiming's eyes held deep confusion. He thought of one person—someone who had done the same before.

"Don't guess recklessly. Just remember, he is a member of the Star Moon Divine Clan!" Fu Xingyue smiled and spoke to Fu Zhiming.

"Yes!" Fu Zhiming bowed his head, nodding. Though Fu Xingyue's words didn't directly confirm it, they also didn't deny it. Combined with the voice that had echoed in his mind at the Netherworld's entrance, Fu Zhiming's body trembled violently.

"Who else refuses?" Luo Tian gazed at the remaining Star Moon Guards, his eyes still smiling as he crossed his arms.

"Submissive!"

"I truly submit!" A chorus of respectful voices arose, their eyes filled with reverence.

"Alright. Since no one has any objections, from today on, Gu San Si shall be the new Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards!" Fu Xingyue softly spoke, then vanished from the spot.

"Handle the remaining matters, Fu Zhiming!" Fu Xingyue's voice echoed in the training ground.

"Yes!" Fu Zhiming's eyes were respectful. He then gazed at Luo Tian with intense focus, approaching him.

"Deputy Commander of the Star Moon Guards, pay homage to the Grand Commander!" Fu Zhiming bowed to Luo Tian. The Star Moon Guards were puzzled, surprised that Fu Zhiming showed no signs of resistance and directly paid homage to the new commander.

"Alright, since everyone submits, continue training. Now that all clans have gathered here, don't fear any conflicts with other royal clans. If anything happens, I'll take responsibility for you!" Luo Tian spoke loudly and then nodded to Fu Zhiming. Under Fu Zhiming's guidance, they disappeared from the Star Moon Guards' sight.

"This line sounds familiar. But just for this sentence, I submit, because Dream Morning Commander once said the same thing!" The Star Moon Guards murmured among themselves, finally showing a hint of reverence.

Luo Tian didn't care about what the Star Moon Guards thought. He had no intention of staying permanently in the Star Moon Divine Clan's base. After all, he was ultimately human. It was inconvenient to be here in the Netherworld where various clans were present. The reason he took this Grand Commander position was simply to make things easier for himself in the Netherworld.

...

The next day, Luo Tian sat cross-legged in a somewhat luxurious room. Though it was the base, the Star Moon Divine Clan, which always pursued quality of life, had built it luxuriously. Though it was inferior to the Star Moon Continent, it was far better than other royal clans.

"Divine Emperor's decree..." As Luo Tian opened his eyes, a middle-aged man appeared outside his residence.

"Divine Emperor's decree commands the new Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards to proceed to the newly built alchemy hall... to clean out..." The middle-aged man paused at the end, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Damn..." Luo Tian stood up, listening to the man finish. He cursed inwardly but, as he was still the Grand Commander, he bowed respectfully and took the golden decree.

"It's that annoying girl!" Luo Tian didn't need to guess; it was definitely Fu Xingxuan teasing him.

"Clean out..." The Star Moon Guards looked on with admiration. The middle-aged man's voice wasn't quiet, and almost all Star Moon Guards heard it. They couldn't help but laugh.

"Back then, Dream Morning Commander was also ordered by the Divine Emperor at that time—then Princess Xingxuan—to clean out. It's amazing our new Grand Commander received the same treatment upon his first day!" The Star Moon Guards looked with nostalgia and schadenfreude, watching Luo Tian walk out of the room looking郁闷.

"I'll endure!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, his face showing authority. He adjusted his attire and flew toward the alchemy hall.

"Ge Erniu, Fan Xuehai, your training task today is to fight against five thousand Star Moon Guards!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in the ears of many Star Moon Guards.

"Commander, we're sorry. I didn't mean to laugh out loud!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Ge Erniu and Fan Xuehai's faces turned gloomy. They had almost laughed out loud, which Luo Tian had clearly heard.

As Luo Tian went to the alchemy hall to clean out, news of his new Grand Commander position spread throughout the Star Moon Divine Clan's base. The people of the Star Moon Divine Clan hadn't expected that the long-vacant position of Grand Commander would be appointed. People were curious about who this mysterious figure was. Soon, people flocked to the alchemy hall to watch Luo Tian clean out.

"Truly..." Luo Tian felt like a monkey under the crowd's gaze. After enduring an entire day, he finally finished his task, feeling like it had lasted years. He returned to his residence.

"Divine Emperor's decree commands the new Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards to clean out the stables..." The next morning, the middle-aged man appeared again at Luo Tian's room. His voice echoed throughout the Star Moon Divine Clan's base.

"Annoying girl!" Luo Tian sighed as he stood up. This time, he didn't even bother to bow and took the decree.

"Is our commander offended the Divine Emperor?" The Star Moon Guards murmured. However, no one laughed anymore because Ge Erniu and Fan Xuehai were still in bed, not getting up.

"This commander should keep a distance from now on. He must have offended the Divine Emperor!" Other people of the Star Moon Divine Clan also murmured.

"Divine Emperor's decree... Divine Emperor's decree..." For the next few days, every time Luo Tian opened his eyes, the middle-aged man's voice would sound at his room's entrance. It almost drove Luo Tian mad.

"Even Dream Morning Commander didn't have this treatment!" The Star Moon Guards looked in disbelief. They couldn't believe that this new Grand Commander had offended the Divine Emperor so severely.

"I'll endure!" Luo Tian constantly comforted himself every morning, hoping Fu Wenbin and the Star Moon Divine Clan's准王 would emerge from their cultivation soon. He really couldn't stand it anymore.

Luo Tian grabbed the golden decree and stepped out of his room, only to see Fu Xingyue smiling at him.

"Brother, things are going smoothly for you these days!" Fu Xingyue softly spoke, looking at Luo Tian's listless appearance.

"Rubbish. That annoying girl almost drove me mad!" Luo Tian hung his head, glaring at Fu Xingyue.

"Speak louder. You don't think if you shout out, everyone in the base would gather around? Xingxuan's reputation is unparalleled!" Fu Xingyue smiled.

"Don't..." Luo Tian shivered, recalling the scene when he was searched for throughout the Star Moon Divine City.

"Alright. The time is up. My clan's准王 and Grand Master have emerged from cultivation. I've already made arrangements; they want to meet you!" Fu Xingyue softly spoke, causing Luo Tian's body to tremble.

Chapter 1487: I Want to Go Too

"Finally, they've emerged!" Luo Tian was almost crying. If this continued for another ten or fifteen days, he felt like he would go mad. He tore the golden decree apart and adjusted his attire before following Fu Xingyue to the准王's cultivation site.

The two arrived at a grand hall under the respectful gazes of the Star Moon Divine Clan's people. Fu Xingyue wore a respectful expression.

"Grand Master, the Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards has arrived!" Fu Xingyue bowed to the hall and did not enter.

"Crack..." The hall's door slowly opened, causing Luo Tian's expression to slightly change. He nodded at Fu Xingyue and stepped into the hall.

A wave of energy affected Luo Tian's body, causing his figure to vanish within the hall.

"Boom..." After what seemed like an eternity, Luo Tian's feet finally steadied on the ground. He looked around.

The hall was brilliantly illuminated, with a magnificent altar standing before him. Four figures radiating immense power sat on the altar, their presence sending a terrifying aura toward Luo Tian.

"Respect to the Grand Master and准王!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to the four people, who were the准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan and three Grand Masters.

"Ah! You really dared to come here!" Fu Wenbin's face showed admiration as he spoke softly, then gazed respectfully at the准王 sitting there.

"Flash..." Two golden lights flickered. The准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan slowly opened his eyes, and an invisible aura immediately descended upon Luo Tian's body. His body trembled slightly.

"Unexpectedly, you dared to come to my Star Moon Divine Clan. Do you know your crime?" The准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan coldly sneered, his eyes icy as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"I am unaware!" Luo Tian slightly bowed and showed respect, locking eyes with the准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Human clan and Ancient Clans are natural enemies. You've killed countless Ancient Clans, even slaying the son of an ancient king. According to the Ancient Clans' agreement, I should have killed you. Yet you've come here yourself!" The准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan's eyes remained cold, and his pressure surged again toward Luo Tian.

"Crack..." A series of cracking sounds rose from Luo Tian's body, making his face grim. His legs trembled as he looked at the准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan, feeling an urge to kneel.

"Initiation?" Luo Tian silently laughed. His blood and energy surged, emitting a pure white light to counter the准王's pressure.

"I don't know what your intention is, but please speak directly. There's no need for this!" Luo Tian gradually regained his composure and smiled.

"If you wanted to kill me, you should have done so when I was in the Star Moon Divine Clan. Why now?"

"Of course, if you regret it later, you can still kill me now. But I'm standing here; are you brave enough to do it?" Luo Tian took a step toward the altar, as if he felt no pressure at all.

"If I killed you, what then?" The准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan looked at Luo Tian's pressure and showed a hint of surprise. However, his eyes soon turned cold again.

"I don't look down on you, but you dare not!" Luo Tian heard the准王's words and stopped. His body radiated an傲然.

"I've stayed in the Star Moon Divine Clan for a long time. I know quite a bit about the Ancient Clans. The Ancient Clans are not as harmonious as humans see them!"

"Although my strength is nothing, behind me are three great masters. Any one of them could annihilate a royal clan if they went all out!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with arrogance. He implied that if the准王 killed him, his backers would retaliate.

"I don't believe that because of you, the three great masters from the human clan would fight with us Star Moon Divine Clan!" The准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan, hearing Luo Tian's words, showed disdain.

"Gu Tianshu, who killed five巅峰 masters, is my ancestor! Do you think he would fight for his favorite disciple?" Luo Tian's eyes smiled, as if he had guessed the准王's thoughts.

"And Master Dongbo has a deep friendship with me. If I die, he will definitely seek justice for me!"

"Master Ji Jiuyou once wanted to take me as a disciple. Also, when the Seven Star Island left the蛮荒大陆, he fought to block the attack of a巅峰 master from the Netherworld and sent me into the inheritance site of the Intercepting Heaven Master, passing through the third decay of the Heavenly Decay!" Luo Tian spoke one after another, his voice filled with strength. He knew what the准王 wanted to hear.

Strength. The more powerful Luo Tian appeared before the准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan, the better it was for him.

Luo Tian's words echoed like thunder in the hall, causing the准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan to fall silent. Fu Wenbin's face also showed shock, not expecting Luo Tian's backing to be so strong.

"Good!" The准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan withdrew his pressure and looked at Luo Tian, his eyes showing satisfaction.

As Luo Tian had guessed, the准王 of the Star Moon Divine Clan wanted to see what power Luo Tian truly possessed. However, based on his guess, having Gu Tianshu was already good enough. He hadn't expected Luo Tian's backing to include the three great masters who had appeared before.

Ji Jiuyou, Gu Tianshu, and Dongbo. If they went mad, they could easily annihilate a royal clan.

"Old man's name is Fu Cangshan. Tell me your purpose for coming to the Netherworld, and I'll try my best to help if we can," Fu Cangshan of the Star Moon Divine Clan spoke softly, clearly acknowledging Luo Tian.

"I just want to enter the Netherland and discuss with the Star Moon Divine Clan. I hope that in future wars, your clan won't participate!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Fu Cangshan.

"Go ahead. The first thing I can do is help you as much as possible. But the second thing is impossible. If there's a real war, we won't be able to stay out of it; otherwise, our Star Moon Divine Clan would be annihilated by the other royal clans!"

"We can only ensure we don't attack your forces!" Fu Cangshan clearly didn't accept Luo Tian's proposal, stating the Star Moon Divine Clan's bottom line.

"That's troublesome!" Luo Tian knew this was the Star Moon Divine Clan's final limit. He didn't argue; doing so would already be a great help from the Star Moon Divine Clan.

However, Luo Tian understood that the Star Moon Divine Clan was gambling. They were betting on his future becoming a great master, on him attaining enlightenment. The returns would be multiplied, and with Gu Tianshu's three masters, the Star Moon Divine Clan wouldn't lose.

Luo Tian stayed in the hall for a while, discussing details with Fu Cangshan. Then he stepped out of the hall.

"Wenbin, you've made a good choice. This kid, even if he doesn't attain enlightenment, is definitely a formidable force. He can protect our Star Moon Divine Clan for a long time. Keep friendly relations!" Fu Cangshan looked at Luo Tian leaving the hall and spoke to Fu Wenbin.

"But we can't help much now. After all, the agreement is still in place. With those three people from the human clan, the Ancient Clans are deeply wary of them. Those three are terrifying; I feel they've gone far down that path, much farther than us," Fu Wenbin respectfully replied.

"Try to help as much as possible. This kid is worth it!" Fu Cangshan softly spoke, not mentioning Luo Tian's potential but acknowledging that the three masters behind him were worth their support.

Luo Tian didn't know what Fu Cangshan and the others said. He stepped out of the hall, transported by power to appear outside.

As soon as he appeared, Luo Tian saw Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang waiting there for him.

"Long wait!" He smiled, greeted them, then softly said: "Let's go!"

"Yes. We need to hurry. I just received news that Tu Feiyang and others have already gone ahead to the Netherland. They've gained a long lead!" Fu Xingyue softly spoke, then soared into the sky.

"Then let's hurry!" Luo Tian's eyes also showed a hint of urgency. If Gu Qianxue and Sun Mengru were truly trapped in the Netherland, and if Tu Feiyang found them first, the consequences would be unimaginable.

The three stood in the sky. As they were about to move, a streak of purple light flashed across and Fu Xingxuan's figure instantly appeared before them.

"Where are you going?" Fu Xingxuan coldly sneered, gazing at Luo Tian before speaking to Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang.

"Xingxuan, don't cause trouble. We have important matters!" Fu Xinyang's face turned serious as he spoke to Fu Xingxuan.

"I am the Divine Emperor of the Star Moon Divine Clan. What important matters do you have? Don't you think I should report to the Divine Emperor?" Fu Xingxuan smiled, her beauty making Luo Tian momentarily stunned.

"Let's go. I'll personally accompany you!" Fu Xingxuan smiled, her eyes scanning Luo Tian and the others.

"Xingxuan, listen. This isn't a place for you. Besides, if you go, what will happen to the Star Moon Divine Clan? Who'll manage it?" Fu Xingyue spoke seriously.

The last time at the Thunder Palace, they had vivid memories. If it weren't for Luo Tian's extraordinary performance, they might have perished in the Thunder Palace. The Netherland was one of the nine deadly places, and they naturally didn't want Fu Xingxuan to take this risk. It was far more dangerous than the Thunder Palace.

Chapter 1488: Heading to the Netherland

"I am the Divine Emperor? You are the Divine Emperor? Who is the greatest in the Star Moon Divine Clan besides the three Grand Masters and the准王?" Fu Xingxuan's eyes gleamed with pride. This was her first time feeling the position of Divine Emperor so good.

"..."

Luo Tian, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xinyang were speechless as they looked at Fu Xingyue. They hadn't expected her to bring up their status now.

"Anyway, I don't care. There's no negotiation. You're all here, so you should protect me, right?" Fu Xingxuan looked at their苦笑 and her expression of pride became even more intense.

"Take the King's Weapon, Star Moon Spear!" Fu Xingyue then spoke, directly taking the King's Weapon to go.

"Take it. Just in case!" Fu Xinyang also agreed, knowing that if Fu Xingxuan wanted to follow, they couldn't stop her. After all, Fu Xingxuan was now the Divine Emperor of the Star Moon Divine Clan. They couldn't bind her here, otherwise, where would Fu Xingxuan's face go?

Moreover, Fu Xingxuan's current strength, under the Star Moon Divine Clan's intensive training, even Fu Xinyang and Fu Xingxuan themselves weren't confident they could bind Fu Xingxuan.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed longingly, looking at Fu Xingxuan and a bad premonition arose in his heart.

"I want to see what kind of person your wife is!" Fu Xingxuan thought to herself, then stood before the three.

"Let's go!" As she spoke, Fu Xingyue took out the Star Moon Divine Clan's King's Weapon and handed it to Fu Xingxuan.

"Use the King's Weapon to break through space and escape when critical!" Fu Xinyang and Fu Xingyue reiterated, then the four of them vanished from their spot, leaving the continent and appearing under the gray starry sky.

"Go!" The four of them found their direction, becoming four streaks of light and flying toward the Netherworld's deadly place, the Netherland.

After half a day, they arrived at the distance of thousands of miles from the deadly Netherland. They stopped and looked around with confusion.

The gray mist was gradually thickening, and people were moving in and out. However, their eyes showed fear, looking at the Netherland, one of the nine deadly places, shrouded in thick mist.

At the moment they stopped, a cold and sinister aura was felt under the starry sky, making people shiver.

"Is it the Star Moon Divine Clan's Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang? That is the Divine Emperor of the Star Moon Divine Clan, Fu Xingxuan?" As soon as Luo Tian and the others appeared, a group of people from the Ancient Clans showed respect and surrounded them. However, Luo Tian was ignored.

"Did Tu Feiyang enter?" Fu Xingyue looked at the Netherland shrouded in gray mist and asked.

"Yes, they entered three days ago. However, there has been no news since then!" Fu Xingyue's high status naturally had someone answer her.

"Who can tell me what the situation is?" Fu Xinyang frowned and asked.

"One month ago, this place hadn't been shrouded in mist. But half a month ago, the Netherland had produced a series of booming sounds. Then gray mist poured out and shrouded the surrounding thousands of miles!"

"Previously, we also had clan members try to enter. However, they eventually extinguished their soul lamps and never came out!" A young man's face was sad. He looked at the sinister gray mist.

"Later, more people entered. Even a mid-epoch master was among them. However, the only one who came out from that group of people was this mid-epoch master. But he became a madman, constantly laughing and sometimes emitting cries of sorrow, as if seeing something terrifying. Even soul-searching couldn't reveal what he had experienced!" The young man continued, looking at Fu Xingyue.

"Is that person still around?" Luo Tian asked, his eyes filled with confusion as he questioned the people around.

"Yes. But he's not here now. Previously, blood clan and蛮族's prodigies also searched for that mid-epoch master. They performed soul-searching on him, but still found nothing."

"Not simple at all! So many masters died so easily? Even a mid-epoch master came out as a madman! Is the Netherland originally so terrifying, or has something terrible changed?" Luo Tian's mind was puzzled. He looked at the gray mist with a serious expression.
