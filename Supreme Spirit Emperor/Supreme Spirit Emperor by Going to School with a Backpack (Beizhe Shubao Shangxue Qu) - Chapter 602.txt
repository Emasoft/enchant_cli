Jiang Yuyu and others were equally enraged. They dashed frantically up the Heavenly Demon Mountain, determined to catch up with Jiang Yu's footsteps. After a quarter of an hour of running, they finally reached the summit of the Heavenly Demon Mountain. Before them stood a golden and black dual-color door, with four figures standing beneath it.

"Surely it's Jiang Yu. How could he be so fast?" The crowd instantly recognized the four figures—Jiang Yu, who had not appeared for a long time.

" How could they be so fast?" Jiang Yu also spotted Lu Tian's group, his expression puzzled as he clenched his teeth.

"I'll take the golden door. You two go through the black one!" Jiang Yu addressed the three, then strode into the golden door with Jiang Dao.

" This..." Jiang Wuxin and Tu Tiansheng's faces darkened. They had arrived earlier, but the dual-color door stood before them, radiating an overwhelming aura. One side was lifeless and bleak, while the other seemed to brim with infinite vitality.

They had hesitated for a long time, knowing that the "death door" did not necessarily mean death and the "life door" did not guarantee survival.

" Hurry up, no time!" Jiang Yu sneered, unwilling to let Lu Tian's group catch up. He leapt into the life door.

" Jiang Yu, stop!" Jiang Yutian shouted, his golden sword blazing with radiant light. He unleashed a blade qi that slashed toward Jiang Yu's direction.

Others also shouted, launching martial arts techniques toward Jiang Yu. Even Lu Tian did so, exerting all his strength. After all, it was a combined attack; who died was none of their concern.

A thunderous roar echoed as the collective power surged toward the life-and-death doors, causing Jiang Wuxin and Tu Tiansheng's faces to darken. They clenched their teeth, sensing the terrifying fluctuations behind them—techniques capable of annihilating them completely. They rushed into the death door.

Jiang Wuxin and others plunged into the death door, while Lu Tian's group's techniques struck the dual-color gate. A resounding震荡 echoed on the mountain top, violent winds sweeping outward. Yet the dual-color gate remained unmoved, radiating an imposing aura.

" They've escaped! Indeed!" Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yufeng's faces darkened as they approached the life-and-death doors, their gazes filled with solemnity.

" What is this thing? It can withstand our combined attack!" The crowd arrived at the life-and-death doors, gazing at the imposing gate.

" Life-Death Gate! One side is life, one side death. All depends on a single thought!"

" What kind of opportunity lies beyond this gate?" Lu Tian mused, sensing the gate's uniqueness.

" Hum..." As Lu Tian and others approached the life-and-death door, his Dragon-Subduing Sword on his back trembled violently again, attempting to break free from its sheath.

" Which one should we choose? Life may not mean survival, and death may not mean demise!"

" This must be the trial Father gave us. The test is the Divination Art—who can decipher which door holds true vitality!" Jiang Yuze spoke softly, his eyes gleaming with brilliance.

" This is a contest among us. Only we possess the Divination Art!" Jiang Yutian smiled, speaking softly.

" A contest of divination?" Jiang Yufeng and others also smiled, their confidence evident in their eyes.

" The Diviner!" Lu Tian's eyes turned cold. He recalled a person—when he was hunted by the three major sects of Zhong San, it was the Diviner who constantly calculated his position. That Diviner hailed from Bountiful Heaven Mountain.

" I've arrived at Bountiful Heaven Mountain now. The Diviner will inevitably cross paths with me. I'll see what kind of figure he truly is!" Lu Tian mused, gazing at Jiang Yuze's group. Clearly, this was a contest among them, unrelated to his own concerns.

" Jiang Yu chose the life door. Clearly, he calculated a higher chance of survival!" Fu Xingyue spoke, gazing at the golden door.

" Let's see. How extraordinary is Bountiful Heaven Mountain's Divination Art!" Lu Tian smiled, gazing at Jiang Yuze.

Jiang Yuze extended his hand, retrieving a copper coin. He split it in two while tracing talismans with his hands and reciting incantations. Then he tossed the coins into the air.

Jiang Yulong and others employed different methods of divination. Some set up altars, while others used yellow talismans. Their actions resembled those of common fortune-tellers, appearing mysterious and superstitious.

" The young masters are still at the初级 level of divination. I heard that Bountiful Heaven Immortal King could calculate fate with just his fingers, predicting a person's future!"

" However, the higher one's cultivation, the harder it is to predict. It's said that Divination Art can reveal a person's fate line, but it also depends on one's cultivation. If one reaches the Immortal King level, it becomes difficult to predict. Some fate lines are particularly unique, protected by heavenly will, making them hard to decipher!" Jiang Huantian spoke softly, watching the two halves of the copper coin descend from the sky.

" Hum..." The two halves of the copper coins spun violently, emitting a humming sound as they descended toward Jiang Yuze's hands.

" Burst..." However, when the two coins were just several zhang away from Jiang Yuze's hands, they exploded violently, turning into dust and vanishing from Jiang Yuze's sight.

Jiang Yuze furrowed his brows, a trickle of blood oozing from the corner of his mouth. Yet he smiled.

" Interesting. This is my father's obstacle, one that evades heavenly will, preventing us from divining it. However, there is still a chance—though we must explore it ourselves. Third brother probably rushed in recklessly!" Jiang Yuze's eyes gleamed with a smile, retrieving two more copper coins and tossing them into the sky.

Meanwhile, unexpected events occurred elsewhere. Some were set ablaze, while others were struck by lightning from the sky, crashing onto them. The life-and-death gate area became chaotic.

" Elder Jiang Huantian, is there a person named the Diviner on Bountiful Heaven Mountain?" Lu Tian asked softly, ignoring Jiang Yuze's second divination.

" The Diviner?" Upon hearing Lu Tian's words, Jiang Huantian furrowed his brows, a hint of fear in his eyes.

" The Diviner is indeed from Bountiful Heaven Mountain. He's a senior elder, highly esteemed. Even the Bountiful Heaven Immortal King allowed him to study Divination Art exceptionally."

" Once he mastered it, the Diviner immediately displayed astonishing talent. In just a few decades, his mastery of Divination Art was no less than that of the Jiang family's senior elders. Hence, he is called 'The Diviner'!"

" However, since mastering Divination Art, the Diviner has rarely appeared in people's sight. It is said he went on a journey through the immortal realm. The last time he appeared was when those sects in Zhong San calculated your position."

" Lu Tian, I know you two have a grudge. But I advise you not to target him. You're strong, but the Diviner isn't weak either. He's highly respected on Bountiful Heaven Mountain. No one has ever had a good outcome by opposing him!" Jiang Huantian spoke to Lu Tian, causing his brows to furrow.

" Regardless of who it is, let's see first. Isn't he not on Bountiful Heaven Mountain?" Lu Tian spoke softly, gazing at Jiang Yuze. At this moment, Jiang Yuze had retrieved three copper coins.

" This is my limit!" Jiang Yuze spoke, biting his finger and drawing a blood line across the three coins before tossing them into the sky.

" Hum..." The three coins spun, emitting a series of explosive sounds as they soared into the clouds, vanishing from Lu Tian's sight.

Time passed. Three breaths later, the three coins descended from the sky toward Jiang Yuze's hands. However, as they neared his grasp, they trembled violently.

" Stabilize!" Jiang Yuze roared, tracing divine laws toward the coins.

" Burst..." Despite his efforts, two of the coins exploded. One coin, riddled with cracks, landed in Jiang Yuze's hand.

" Puk..." Jiang Yuze spat blood, his face pale. He gazed at the cracked coin in his hand and transmitted mentally to Lu Tian's group: "A one percent chance of life door!"

Thunderous roars echoed as Jiang Yulong and others also calculated, their faces pale with grim smiles. Though they looked pitiful, they transmitted to their companions.

" Father is really annoying! How could we possibly calculate it!" Jiang Yulong spoke, but he rushed into the death door with an old man of semi-immortal king level.

Others also seemed to have默契, taking their semi-immortal king companions into the doors they had calculated. They left the remaining people to enter the other door.

" What should we do?" Seeing everyone rushing in, Jiang Yuze hesitated and asked Lu Tian's group.

Chapter 2279: Entering the Death Door()

At the life-and-death gate, figures moved. Whether willing or not, the sect disciples rushed into the gates. In an instant, only Lu Tian's group remained standing there.

" You go to the life door. I'll take the death door!" Lu Tian spoke softly, gazing at Jiang Yuze.

" No! Though it's only one percent, the life door still has a higher chance. Do you want my sister to become a widow? Did I agree?" Fu Xingyue quickly shook her head, disagreeing.

" Let's all go to the life door. I can't let you die!" Jiang Yuze finally clenched his teeth, though it was disadvantageous for him. He spoke to Lu Tian's group.

" Forget it. I have confidence! You go to the life door, and I'll enter the death door!" Lu Tian gently soothed Dragon-Subduing Sword on his back. This was his confidence; he could feel that the sword's direction pointed to the death door, and several of Jiang Yuze's brothers also chose the death door.

" You go to the life door!" Lu Tian spoke, not waiting for Jiang Yuze's group to object. He rushed into the black death door.

" Wait for me!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xiangyang didn't hesitate, rushing into the death door behind Lu Tian.

" Young master..." Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying gazed at Jiang Yuze, awaiting his command.

" We'll go to the life door!" Jiang Yuze softly shook his head, stepping into the golden door.

As if passing through a barrier, Lu Tian's feet touched ground. He found himself on a black battlefield, instantly enveloped by an icy aura. The battlefield was littered with dried bloodstains, still radiating a formidable presence despite their age. Lu Tian felt awed.

"This battlefield has seen the death of an Immortal King!" Lu Tian's eyes were solemn as he gazed around. The battlefield stretched endlessly.

" Two people, only one can survive!" A cold voice echoed in Lu Tian's mind.

" Hum..." A black figure appeared before Lu Tian. The figure radiated a powerful aura, its form tangible. The youth wore black robes with a purple "Demon" character etched on them, exuding an icy and ruthless aura.

" A strong figure from the Heavenly Demon Sect?" Lu Tian was startled. He hadn't realized this youth wasn't a real human.

" Only one can survive!" Lu Tian immediately recalled the voice in his mind. He took a step back.

As Lu Tian retreated, the youth flew forward, rushing toward him with swirling black qi that obscured his form and face.

" Roar..." A tiger's roar echoed as the youth transformed into a black tiger, pouncing toward Lu Tian.

" True Immortal Late Stage!" As the youth transformed into a tiger, Lu Tian sensed his strength—True Immortal Late Stage. His heart felt reassured. He retrieved the Rupture Heaven Spear, thrusting it forward.

Not that Lu Tian didn't want to use Dragon-Subduing Sword, but he feared it might provoke a reaction. After all, Dragon-Subduing Sword was outside the life-and-death gate, and it had reacted intensely.

" Boom..." A black dragon rose, biting the tiger's heart and piercing through it.

" Bang..." The next moment, the black tiger transformed into swirling demonic qi that spread outward. Lu Tian's Rupture Heaven Spear accurately pierced the youth's heart.

The youth's body was lifted into the air but no blood flowed. His face was numb, gazing at Lu Tian before shattering.

" Not a real person?" Lu Tian watched the youth dissolve into swirling black qi, his face slightly changed.

As Lu Tian pondered, another figure appeared. Still the same youth, but his aura had risen to True Immortal Peak.

" Only one can survive!" The cold voice echoed in Lu Tian's mind again, causing his brows to furrow.

" Will his level rise if I kill him?" Lu Tian's mind grew more solemn. He had encountered this before.

The youth's strength reached True Immortal Peak, his aura completely changed. It gave Lu Tian a slight sense of crisis.

" Who is this person? He must not be ordinary. Few can make me feel a threat at the same level!" Lu Tian marveled, his Rupture Heaven Spear radiating divine light. He raised the spear and met the descending black tiger's paw.

" Bang..." The Rupture Heaven Spear bent, a tiger's paw striking Lu Tian's spear. At the same time, Lu Tian's body retreated several steps. Not yet steady, a second tiger's paw descended, forcing Lu Tian to retreat again, his qi shaking.

" Roar..." The tiger's head bit down toward Lu Tian. If devoured, he knew it wouldn't be good.

Lu Tian gripped the Rupture Heaven Spear tightly and swung it fiercely. Three spear images merged, a black dragon sweeping in to strike the tiger's head.

" Bang..." The tiger's image shattered. The youth's body, battered and wounded, fell to the ground. This time, he wasn't killed immediately but quickly stood up, drawing a black sword and rushing toward Lu Tian.

" Hmm?" Lu Tian's eyes narrowed. He sensed the difference in the youth's sword. The black sword bore flowing dark magic patterns, though it was demonic qi, it gave Lu Tian a feeling no less than an authentic immortal artifact. It was nearly as strong as his Rupture Heaven Spear, just slightly inferior.

" Hum..." The sword's aura flickered. A single slash flew out, instantly transforming into a blade of light that slashed toward Lu Tian's direction. The black sword's aura arrived instantly, causing Lu Tian's face to change drastically. That black blade vanished without a trace, leaving no sense of its presence.

" The third level of sword art!" Lu Tian exclaimed in disbelief. This youth, seemingly young, was strong and even more shocking—he had mastered the third level of sword art.

Lu Tian moved with Huangquan Step, vanishing from his spot and appearing thousands of zhang away. He tightly gripped the Rupture Heaven Spear. The third level of sword art was enough to threaten Lu Tian.

" Behind!" Lu Tian stopped, feeling a chill at his back. He blocked the black blade with his spear but was still cut by its sharp edge, blood flowing from his shoulder.

" A terrifying opponent!" Lu Tian muttered to himself. He gazed at the youth who appeared behind him like a ghost, wielding the sword and beginning to fight. He didn't want the youth to unleash another blade qi, which would be too passive for him.

While Lu Tian fought the youth, others who had entered the death door faced similar situations, battling the youth. Meanwhile, those who had entered the life door encountered no obstacles at all. They saw only a series of doors, same as the life-and-death gate. Choosing the life door allowed them to proceed.

Lu Tian continuously fought against the youth, subduing him. Though subdued, it would take Lu Tian considerable time to eliminate him.

Time passed. Lu Tian eventually reached True Immortal Peak, his body unparalleled in strength and his cultivation several times that of a regular True Immortal. After half an hour of battle, the youth was finally pierced through the throat by Lu Tian's spear. The cost for Lu Tian was a shoulder wound from the youth.

" Terrifying! He fought me for half an hour!" Lu Tian muttered, taking a pill to recover his injuries. His gaze turned toward the battlefield.

After half an hour of battle, there was inevitably some fault on Lu Tian's part. He wasn't sure if a semi-immortal king youth would appear next. If so, he might be left behind.

" Hum..." As Lu Tian mused, waves of energy surged again. A black figure stood before him, and the cold voice echoed in his mind.

" Damn it! How can I fight this!" Lu Tian cursed inwardly, taking a step back. He cautiously watched the youth holding the sword.

As Lu Tian cursed, black qi surged from the ground. This time it wasn't toward the youth but toward Lu Tian. The demonic qi surged, instantly covering his body with a black figure, as if transforming him into a demon. His hair was dark and glossy.

At the same time, Lu Tian's aura rapidly ascended, breaking through True Immortal Peak and reaching Semi-Immortal King.

" This... is this possible?" Lu Tian's face showed shock. He felt his strength and gazed at the youth rushing toward him.

" This is a fragment of vitality within the death door!" Lu Tian realized, experiencing the power of Semi-Immortal King. He extended his fist and struck.

" Bang..." The fists collided, both retreating. Lu Tian's fist bore cracks. He watched the youth also retreat.

" Who is this person!" Lu Tian muttered, feeling he had been at a disadvantage in the previous clash. After all, Lu Tian had just ascended to True Immortal Peak and suddenly surged to Semi-Immortal King, which was a bit unaccustomed. However, Lu Tian was confident he was still strong. Yet in the previous clash, he hadn't gained an advantage.

As Lu Tian marveled, the youth rushed forward again. His form was like a black lightning bolt, his speed surpassing Lu Tian's eyesight.

A sword with flowing black talismans appeared in the youth's hand. The black blade's aura swept out again. This time, the black sword surpassed an upper-grade immortal artifact, just a little short of an极品 immortal artifact. It was on par with the Rupture Heaven Spear.

" Gun Master of the Heavens!" Ten thousand black spear images erupted from Lu Tian's hands, surrounding him. At the same time, the youth's sword radiated ten thousand feet of brilliance—this was the fourth level of sword art.

Chapter 2280: The Demon King()

Spear art was Lu Tian's strongest. He hadn't used "Gun Master of the Heavens" for many years, but now it was unleashed with immense power. Each spear image contained Lu Tian's understanding of spear art.

The youth's aura was equally formidable, not much different from Lu Tian. In fact, it slightly surpassed him because Lu Tian's Semi-Immortal King was forcibly enhanced by the demonic qi.

The youth's surroundings were surrounded by waves of black sword qi, forming an ultimate sword domain. The sword qi clashed with Lu Tian's spear images.

Lu Tian had seen Du Jianhang use a sword domain. This youth's sword domain was vastly different in power but sufficient to deal with Lu Tian.

" Heaven-Devine Dao Art!" Lu Tian's hands formed seals, and a powerful pressure radiated from his body. This pressure was added to each spear image, clashing with the formidable sword qi.

Thunderous roars echoed across the battlefield. Two figures seemed to enter another clash. If an Immortal King was present, they would be astonished by Lu Tian and the youth's extraordinary power.

Both figures used Heaven-Devine Dao Art and a sword domain. These were features of an Immortal King's domain, more accurately, the雏形 of a domain. If both could enter the Immortal King realm, they would form a domain in a short time.

Lu Tian and the youth stood there. The spear images and sword qi clashed, but if one side couldn't withstand it, they would face a storm of attacks.

Pressure. Lu Tian felt immense pressure from the youth. This situation hadn't happened to him in a long time.

Time passed. The youth seemed to have endless cultivation, continuously launching black sword qi while Lu Tian countered with spear images. Half an hour passed, and sweat appeared on Lu Tian's face. His mental state was beginning to falter, and his cultivation also struggled.

Lu Tian knew he couldn't relax. If he did, it would mean the end of this life-and-death gate's only vitality.

Under immense pressure, Lu Tian's potential began to be squeezed. His body started to naturally circulate his cultivation technique.

The youth's face showed no expression, as if he had endless energy. His countless sword qi was meticulously controlled.

Another half hour passed. Lu Tian's face turned pale, but his eyes were blood-red. If Diao Dezhu and others saw this look on Lu Tian, they would know he was determined.

" Hum..." Gray spiritual soul凝聚 in his mind, continuously inhaling. His golden mind sea churned, rushing toward the gray figure.

" Burst..." Finally, one of Lu Tian's spear images slowed slightly. A black sword qi took advantage and pierced into Lu Tian's Heaven-Devine Dao Art, instantly appearing before him.

" Hold on!" Lu Tian roared, sending a spear image to block it. However, the sword qi pierced into his shoulder, blood flowing from his shoulder.

With a roar, Lu Tian's spiritual soul began to solidify. His Heaven-Devine Dao Art expanded.

" Burst... burst..." As Lu Tian's Heaven-Devine Dao Art expanded, the youth's sword qi began to disintegrate.

" Ten zhang... hundred zhang..." In an instant, Lu Tian's Heaven-Devine Dao Art expanded from a hundred zhang to five hundred zhang.

The youth's sword domain shattered. The sword qi spread out, scattering under Lu Tian's Heaven-Devine Dao Art.

A series of sword marks appeared on the battlefield. Lu Tian's Heaven-Devine Dao Art enveloped the youth, and he gripped the Rupture Heaven Spear. He panted heavily, thrusting his spear forward. Ten thousand spear images erupted from his hands.

The spear images swept over the youth, submerging him in a storm of spear images. He vanished into swirling black qi from Lu Tian's sight.

" Eliminated!" Lu Tian collapsed onto the ground, relief in his eyes. If not for his spiritual soul suddenly breaking through, this clash's outcome would have been uncertain.

At this moment, Lu Tian's spiritual soul turned golden. It was several times stronger than before. His spiritual awareness could now spread far.

" It's a blessing in disguise. My Heaven-Devine Dao Art can now expand to five hundred zhang! And my spiritual soul, though I don't know why it changed like this, clearly represents a breakthrough!" Lu Tian muttered softly, slowly standing up.

" There shouldn't be any more..." Lu Tian exhaled lightly. Before he finished speaking, a surge of black qi凝聚 again, forming a vast ocean of black qi. A figure appeared in Lu Tian's sight.

" Again..." Lu Tian felt speechless. Even a Semi-Immortal King was fought, but if it were an Immortal King, he couldn't fight at all.

As Lu Tian felt speechless, the black figure finally凝聚. It was still like a real person, but this time it wasn't a youth—it had become an older man with a touch of沧桑.

" You're quite good!" The middle-aged man spoke, not attacking but addressing Lu Tian. This caused Lu Tian's face to slightly change.

Though the middle-aged man radiated an early Immortal King level of cultivation, Lu Tian could sense he was no ordinary person. Yet the aura of a king was not something an average person could possess.

" Being able to awaken me is enough to show your strength. Your future holds no limits!" The middle-aged man spoke again, gazing at Lu Tian.

" Respected elder. I don't know your name or title!" Lu Tian bowed slightly, showing respect to a strong figure. He was certain this middle-aged man had been a great power in his time.

" My name is Jing Hang. I am the leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect!"

" The one you fought earlier was my youth phase!" The middle-aged man spoke, gazing at Lu Tian with a contemplative look.

" Leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect..." Lu Tian's heart tightened. He had known this person was no ordinary figure, but he hadn't expected such a big name—someone who dared to challenge the Bountiful Heaven Immortal King.

" Come, accept my three attacks. If you can withstand them, it's a pass. If not, death!" Jing Hang spoke, black demonic qi surging and instantly expanding to thousands of zhang, enveloping Lu Tian.

At the same time, Jing Hang extended his hand. The demonic qi formed a black hand that pressed down toward Lu Tian.

" Life-and-death crisis!" Lu Tian immediately felt the life-and-death crisis. He gazed at the black hand pressing down on him, his face turning pale.

" Hum..." Heaven-Devine Dao Art instantly expanded. Lu Tian's hands quickly formed seals, and the Hellish Ghost Claws erupted, dark ghostly hands rushing toward the black hand.

" A technique of Hell!" Jing Hang's brows slightly furrowed. His hands still pressed down, and a thunderous roar echoed above Lu Tian's head. The Hellish Ghost Claws he had launched were instantly destroyed by the black hand.

The black hand still remained, its power slightly weakened. It ignored Lu Tian's Heaven-Devine Dao Art and pressed down toward him.

" Go..." Lu Tian's face showed madness. He punched forward, this time with five images of fists. Five times the strength of his body was unleashed, enough to shatter everything and even injure an Immortal King.

" Bang..." A strong explosion echoed, shaking Lu Tian. He was directly thrown to the ground, his entire body covered in cracks.

" Cough... cough..."

" It's unfair!" Lu Tian cursed inwardly, slowly standing up. He quickly devoured pills to recover his injuries.

" Indeed a genius!" Jing Hang's face remained expressionless, but there was mockery in his eyes. He raised one hand and formed a seal. A black demon figure appeared behind him, its crimson eyes showing an indifferent expression.

" Heaven-Devine Eye!" Lu Tian gasped. He felt a sense of familiarity with those crimson eyes, instantly recalling where he had seen them.

" Jing Hang is too变态. He's even evolved the Heaven-Devine Eye!" Lu Tian was shocked to the core. However, after thinking, he understood.

" The demon cultivators prefer to defy heaven and fate. Therefore, they face more trials than ordinary cultivators. Jing Hang, as the leader of demons, is naturally more变态. He must have endured many trials and experienced numerous calamities. The Heaven-Devine Eye is something he's seen."

What shocked Lu Tian was that Jing Hang could evolve the Heaven-Devine Eye, which clearly indicated his defiance of fate.

" Hum..." As Lu Tian was shocked, the battlefield hummed. The dried bloodstains on the battlefield moved, flowing toward the demon figure.

The blood transformed into a crimson spear held by the demon figure. It was thrown toward Lu Tian with force.

" Hum..." Lu Tian immediately felt a death threat and drew Dragon-Subduing Sword, holding it before him.

As Lu Tian just held the Dragon-Subduing Sword before him, the crimson spear appeared at his chest. It gave Lu Tian no time to react.

" Puk..." Lu Tian spat blood, feeling as if hit by a mountain. His body was thrown backward, and the crimson spear clashed with Dragon-Subduing Sword. The crimson spear continuously wore down Dragon-Subduing Sword, and blood mist sprayed from it.

Ten zhang... thousand zhang...

Lu Tian retreated a thousand zhang before finally stopping. Dragon-Subduing Sword was torn from his hands, and his hands trembled. His body was covered in blood, looking grotesque.

" Second attack!" Jing Hang's eyes slightly narrowed. He was surprised that Lu Tian could withstand this attack.

" Last attack!" Jing Hang smiled lightly, his aura rising again. Lu Tian's heart sighed in despair.

At this moment, any means of Lu Tian were insufficient against Jing Hang. However, having experienced countless life-and-death situations, he thought of a desperate plan.

Chapter 2281: Demon King's Teachings()

A black rune sword appeared in Jing Hang's hand. The sword radiated an overwhelming aura, and he slowly slashed downward. The battlefield trembled as the black blade qi split the sky and earth, instantly appearing above Lu Tian's head.

" The Book of Epochs!" Lu Tian had no other ideas. He couldn't think of anything that could withstand Jing Hang's full power attack, so he relied on the Book of Epochs.

" Hum..." Golden light radiated from Lu Tian's body. The Book of Epochs slowly flew out, and Lu Tian's face showed determination.

" Hmm?" Jing Hang furrowed his brows. He gazed at the overwhelming aura radiating from Lu Tian's body, even feeling a sense of shock.

In Bountiful Heaven Mountain's gray and solemn hall, an old man sat in meditation. His eyes were closed. This was the top-tier power of Bountiful Heaven Mountain, the Bountiful Heaven Immortal King. He was one of the few masters of the immortal realm.

When Lu Tian's Book of Epochs activated, the Bountiful Heaven Immortal King suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes glowed with divine light: "Indeed!"

The Bountiful Heaven Immortal King only said two words, then fell silent. His eyes showed satisfaction. He extended his hand and a gray mark flew out from it, marking the void.

" Bountiful Heaven, you old bastard. You're always opposing me!" Far away from Bountiful Heaven Mountain, another old man muttered with a scholarly aura.

" The immortal path is broken. The fate has ended. Whether it's good or bad, I can't calculate it. I can't calculate it!" The Bountiful Heaven Immortal King muttered, and the hall fell into silence.

The golden Book of Epochs slowly flew out from Lu Tian's mind. This was his last move, one he didn't want to use but had no choice but to gamble.

" What is this thing?" Jing Hang's face showed disbelief as he gazed at the Book of Epochs hovering above Lu Tian's head.

The golden book flipped, page one... page two...

The Book of Epochs turned three pages. A destructive and world-ending power radiated from it, sweeping toward the black blade qi.

Apocalypse降临. A thunderous collision echoed on the battlefield. Lu Tian spat blood, and the entire world was enveloped in golden light. Even the residual power was enough to severely injure Lu Tian.

The world-ending attack completed, and the golden Book of Epochs slowly returned to Lu Tian's mind. He fell to the ground, his body powerless. His gaze turned toward Jing Hang standing nearby.

" Bountiful Heaven Immortal King, I'll never let you have your way!" Jing Hang's face showed a thoughtful expression. He flew into the air, and his body exploded, transforming into waves of black demonic qi that rushed toward Lu Tian.

At this moment, Lu Tian had no strength left. He watched the black demonic qi swirling around his body with a bad feeling but could only watch as it wrapped around his dantian, entwining the golden-black figure. That figure began to change, gradually fading and losing its ghostly and immortal qi. It was slowly being transformed into a demon.

" I've passed on the Demon Cultivation Art to you. You must cultivate it; now, you are a demon cultivator. To avoid being corrupted by demonic qi, you must cultivate this art!" Jing Hang's authoritative voice echoed in Lu Tian's mind. Lu Tian wanted to cry.

Along with the cultivation technique, several martial arts and demon cultivators' insights were also forcibly implanted into Lu Tian's mind.

" I don't want to be a demon king!" Lu Tian mentally shouted. He was already a ghost cultivator, looked down upon by the immortal realm. If he became a demon cultivator, even hell would look down on him. After all, the reputation of demon cultivators was worse than that of ghost cultivators.

Although demon cultivators wouldn't be universally despised, they would become outcasts. Lu Tian didn't want to draw attention. But he had no choice but to passively accept it, as he had no strength at all.

Time passed. An hour later, Lu Tian was dazed, his mind filled with many things. Jing Hang's weak voice echoed again in Lu Tian's mind.

" Young master, now you are truly a demon cultivator. Feel your strength!"

" Bountiful Heaven Immortal King, I never expected this! Ha ha! My inheritance is eternal!" Jing Hang's weak voice echoed with a touch of madness before fading away.

" What did I do to deserve this? You have a grudge with Bountiful Heaven Immortal King. Go find him! Or at least his sons!" Lu Tian sighed, sitting on the ground.
