Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, his gaze sweeping the surroundings. He noticed that besides the Chaos Domain and Shura Domain, all other domains had already arrived. Naturally, the Shura Domain was excluded since its people were currently trapped within the Demon Domain, despised like a street rat by all. The冥域 (Ming Domain) was naturally excluded from Luo Tian's consideration.

However, the Chaos Domain had no enmity with the Demon Domain; in fact, their relations were quite amicable. Yet, they had not arrived.

"We'll go ahead first!" Zhou Wei nodded to Luo Tian before leading the Star-Seeking Domain's people toward the barrier.

As the Star-Seeking Domain members departed, only Luo Tian's group remained. Their numbers were considerable—over a dozen people. Luo Tian cast a glance over them, his original intention being to let only himself and Long Jie enter. After all, compared to other domains, the Fire Domain and Four Sacred Star Domains had very thin foundations. If these people suffered any misfortune within, it would be devastating for their domains.

"I, Long Jie, Nan Gong Brother, and Tian Luo—four of us will go!" Luo Tian spoke to the group, his voice carrying an unyielding tone.

"Why?" The people's faces bore confusion; they did not understand why Luo Tian had made this arrangement.

"Impossible, I must go too!" Soon after, there was a commotion. Each person's face showed reluctance as they spoke to Luo Tian, especially those talkative ones, making Luo Tian feel his head about to explode.

"Impossible. It's too dangerous inside; I can't guarantee your safety!" Luo Tian shook his head, addressing the group.

"Let me and Hong Tao go too. After all, we're old bones; we've lived long enough!" Lu Han Tian smiled as he spoke to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's brows tightened, his gaze falling upon the eager faces of those present. Finally, he nodded slightly at Lu Han Tian and Du Hong Tao. Their strength was undeniable—early-stage Sage level, with a high chance of success.

"Impossible! My father is going; I'm coming too! Luo Tian Brother, will you take me?" Du Yu Ying pouted, approaching Luo Tian and gently shaking his arm, pulling it insistently. Her coquettish tactics had worked repeatedly these days.

"I'll go too!" Lu Tianyu's eyes burned with battle spirit, his gaze filled with determination as he looked at Luo Tian.

Others also spoke up, expressing their unwillingness to stay behind. They were all restless souls; it would be extremely difficult to convince them to remain.

Luo Tian remained resolute, finally issuing a harsh ultimatum. He added Xu Liyi, Chen Zhanbiao, and Xiu to the group, leaving the rest behind.

Seeing Luo Tian's sternness, Zheng Xin and Gu Lei fell silent, their faces carrying sorrowful expressions. Luo Tian's heart trembled at the sight.

With Luo Tian's decision, nine people including himself flew toward the golden barrier. The reason Luo Tian had chosen these individuals was because their life-preserving techniques were formidable: Xu Liyi's shrewdness, Xiu and Tian Luo's hidden methods, Chen Zhanbiao's formidable body despite his low cultivation.

Under the sorrowful gazes of Gu Lei and others, Luo Tian's group rushed into the barrier.

"嗡……" At the moment Luo Tian touched the barrier, a powerful scanning force swept over him. He knew it was examining his cultivation level, but he sensed an ominous aura from the scanning force.

As he entered halfway through the barrier, Luo Tian suddenly broke out in cold sweat. He thought of one person—The Book of Epochs, that terrifying entity. Luo Tian was certain the elder's strength surpassed even the Early Sage Stage.

"Hope The Book of Epochs can block it!" At this point, Luo Tian could only grit his teeth and proceed. There was no alternative; he couldn't abandon The Book of Epochs.

As Luo Tian prayed repeatedly, the scanning force continued to sweep over him. It seemed hesitant for a moment but ultimately allowed Luo Tian to pass through the barrier without incident, relieving his tense heart.

"The Book of Epochs has never disappointed me!" Luo Tian wiped the sweat from his forehead, gazing around. His eyes suddenly narrowed.

The ancient celestial palace appeared small at first glance, but upon entering, it was a completely different scene. A vast hall came into view, giving an endless impression. The grand architecture left Luo Tian awestruck, and the sacred aura that made one wish to worship was overwhelming. Yet, he felt no danger.

Luo Tian surveyed his surroundings but found no sign of Lu Han Tian and others. Entering the ancient celestial palace meant being randomly transported to different locations.

Luo Tian took cautious steps forward, his body tense. Though no danger was sensed, the ancient celestial palace's fearsome reputation was well-known; countless Early Sage Stage cultivators had perished there. He understood the principle of extremes—what seemed peaceful often concealed great danger.

Each step Luo Tian took left footprints behind, puzzling him. He hesitated to proceed further, his gaze scanning the surroundings. His eyes flashed with a deep violet hue as he attempted to traverse this seemingly endless palace.

"Nine incarnations of rebirth, nine steps—each step a trap. If you survive the traps, you may proceed further!" A low voice echoed through the vast palace, startling Luo Tian's mind.

His violet eyes gazed at the footprints beneath him. He had taken eight steps, and his reflection was clearly visible on the ground. However, he soon noticed that the shadow resembling himself was smiling grotesquely at him.

Chapter 955: Ninety-Nine Soul Fragments

In the tranquil palace, only Luo Tian's breathing echoed. He walked slowly on the smooth floor, his back marked by eight distinct footprints.

"Who could recognize me as one of the nine incarnations?" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with violet light, his mind shaken as he observed his own shadow on the ground, seemingly smiling at him.

"Nine steps—after nine steps, can one proceed to the next level?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed. He did not rush to take the ninth step, unsure of what awaited him.

He glanced around but felt no immediate danger. His brows furrowed slightly.

"Damn it, I'll see what's so special about the ninth step!" Luo Tian muttered coldly, taking a step forward with a fierce expression. His gaze fell upon the shadow that grinned at him.

"嗡……" After taking the ninth step, the vast space suddenly changed. Golden light gradually faded, and the magnificent scenery collapsed instantly. Nine golden footprints rose like nine stars in the dim space.

"Kya kya..." A series of pitiful laughter echoed around Luo Tian, directly striking his mind.

Golden light flared, and the nine footprints seemed to open hell's gates. A wave of gray mist emerged from each footprint.

Under Luo Tian's serious gaze, the gray mist coalesced into tangible figures. Their spiritual energy rose gradually, as if emerging from hell—gray-eyed and lifeless, staring at Luo Tian. His brows furrowed more tightly.

"One... two..." More and more gray figures coalesced, forming a total of ninety-nine. They emerged from the golden footprints under Luo Tian's watchful eye.

The ninety-nine figures took various forms—some human, some beasts. Yet their spiritual energy was formidable; all were at the Early Sage Stage level, making Luo Tian's eyelid twitch.

"Early Sage Stage soul fragments!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and the Rupture Spear appeared. His gaze was cautious as he faced the ninety-nine figures surrounding him, leaving no chance of escape.

"Hey, after so many years, the ancient celestial palace has opened. Finally, we have a chance to escape. If we possess this strong-blooded youth's body, we might even reach the depths of the ancient celestial palace and grasp the Epoch Stage."

"Damn it, what kind of trial is this? It's clearly a death trap!" Luo Tian cursed mentally.

All ninety-nine gray-eyed soul fragments stared at Luo Tian, making his scalp tingle. Though their eyes lacked vitality, he clearly felt greed and desire within them—greed for his body and longing to escape this endless ancient palace.

"Kid, don't resist. Summoning ninety-nine soul fragments shows your talent is extraordinary. But even the most talented won't be our match!" A gray phoenix-shaped soul fragment spoke.

"Do you know how we came here? We were once the prodigies of our time, full of vigor when entering this ancient celestial palace. But before we could reach its depths, we were stopped by the first trial and perished here, sealed away waiting for future generations."

"We've been kept like livestock here, fighting among ourselves as if raising insects. Only the strongest ninety-nine thousand remain, waiting for future generations to test them." The soul fragments spoke without hesitation, revealing everything before Luo Tian could ask.

Luo Tian's mind trembled. The ancient celestial palace truly was a death trap; even prodigies had perished here. This was only the beginning.

"You're remarkable. Ordinarily, one can summon nine soul fragments. Only a prodigy can summon ninety-nine. I don't understand why you came here instead of continuing your cultivation normally. If you survive, you'll surely become a Sage at the peak stage!" The soul fragments spoke with admiration, gazing at Luo Tian.

Having witnessed generations of prodigies enter and perish here, these soul fragments had seen many. Some were possessed by them; others became part of their ranks. Yet, no one had summoned ninety-nine soul fragments before—only five individuals in history. And those five were said to have escaped the ancient celestial palace, making these soul fragments even more desperate to possess Luo Tian and escape.

"Nine-nine Early Sage Stage soul fragments! Damn it!" Luo Tian's mind trembled. Though he was confident against a few opponents, even if they had no special techniques, he could win. But ninety-nine? That was absurd. Even with his confidence, facing ninety-nine Early Sage Stage soul fragments made him hesitant. Moreover, these soul fragments were stronger than ordinary ones—prodigies who had entered the ancient celestial palace over the years.

"Don't resist. If we consume too much, you might be devoured once you become a soul fragment and sealed here. It's better to save your life, at least surviving for now!" A soul fragment radiating gray lightning spoke, persuading Luo Tian with a gaze.

Luo Tian's face darkened. He scanned the ninety-nine soul fragments, calculating his chances of survival.

"Since it's a trial, there must be a chance!" Luo Tian realized. No matter what, he wouldn't surrender.

"Even if it's a dead end, I'll carve out a path to live! I can't die, and I won't allow myself to die!" Luo Tian's eyes turned resolute. His aura rose gradually, his gaze sharp with infinite battle spirit. The Rupture Spear seemed to sense Luo Tian's battle intent, radiating golden light.

"Come on! I've never surrendered. Not in the past, not now. One Early Sage Stage soul fragment I can kill; ten I can handle. These ninety-nine are just dead men!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his body moving forward as he charged at the ninety-nine soul fragments with the Rupture Spear.

"Unmatched prodigy! This mindset is something we can't match. If not for necessity, we might have become friends. But since we want to escape, we must kill you. And only one of us can escape!" The soul fragments roared, their gray martial arts flying across the sky with overwhelming power.

Luo Tian thrust his spear forward at lightning speed, his body like a ghost as he appeared before the most talkative gray phoenix soul fragment. The golden Rupture Spear, imbued with overwhelming tearing power, pierced the gray phoenix's soul fragment instantly.

A phoenix cry echoed, filled with intense pain. Gray energy burst from the phoenix's soul fragment like blood, splashing onto Luo Tian's face.

Withdrawing his spear, Luo Tian showed no joy. Behind him, dozens of martial arts attacks had already formed a terrifying storm sweeping toward him. The combined power of dozens of Early Sage Stage cultivators was overwhelming, even enough to make a Sage Mid-Stage cultivator avoid it.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with caution. He activated the幽冥鬼步 (Yao Ming Ghost Step), vanishing from his spot.

Though he dodged, the phoenix's soul fragment remained. Before it could react, several gray lightning bolts shot out from the storm, striking the phoenix's soul fragment. The massive body of the phoenix immediately emitted thick gray smoke.

In an instant, the storm that occupied half the space swept up the phoenix's massive body, dragging it into the terrifying whirlwind.

"Annihilation!" Before the phoenix could speak, its soul fragment was instantly annihilated by the storm.

"Damn it..." Luo Tian stood at a distance, his face filled with deep apprehension. Though soul fragments lacked physical bodies, their attacks were too terrifying. He was still shaken, watching the gray storm continue to sweep up.

"Kya kya..." A series of chilling laughs echoed. The gray eyes stared at Luo Tian, their gaze cold.

The storm continued to sweep with relentless determination. It seemed determined not to let Luo Tian escape, and the remaining soul fragments' hands radiated gray light. Each one continuously unleashed powerful martial arts into the storm, increasing its power.

"Motherf***er! I'll fight you!" Luo Tian instantly activated his demonic state. He knew even with this, he might not escape this death trap.

"Interesting! This kid knows a secret technique. Good!" People watching saw Luo Tian's black hair flying, his appearance like a demon king. They marveled at him before watching the storm that had completely sealed off the space, their faces showing smiles. They were confident even a Sage Mid-Stage cultivator would perish under their combined attacks, and even a Sage Late Stage powerhouse would have to avoid it.

"Kid, you can go now!" The soul fragments laughed coldly, waiting for Luo Tian to be torn apart by the martial arts storm.

"I'll fight you!" Luo Tian's long hair flew, his black demon sword raised high. He slashed... two slashes... three...

Each slash carried the power of the梵天攻杀之术 (Fan Tian Attack), imbued with Luo Tian's desperate determination. This was the most difficult battle he had faced in years.

Chapter 956: Decisiveness

In the unknown space of the celestial palace, the gray storm occupied half the vast area. The terrifying power would make even a Sage Late Stage cultivator tremble.

Luo Tian's eyes were bloodshot. His black ocean of energy surged within his dantian, and he slashed ten times in a row. Each slash carried overwhelming power, piercing through the entire gray space as if attempting to split it open.

In an instant, Luo Tian had slashed ten times. This was his limit for the seventh blade of the Seven Demonic Blades. At this moment, the black ocean of energy in his dantian had been drained completely, becoming barren.

Luo Tian's eyes were filled with determination. Though he still had some concerns, he knew there was no other way. These ten slashes were his peak performance. The Ten Directions Feathers Drum had already shattered during his fight with Yan Hongtao, and there were no other sacred artifacts to support him.

"Unmatched prodigy! Each slash is breathtaking. Even a Sage Mid-Stage would retreat!"

"This kind of prodigy is dazzling in any era, comparable to the young days of major domain masters!"

"Unfortunately, he still must perish!" The soul fragments' faces showed admiration as they watched the ten slashes piercing through space. They confirmed that even a Sage Mid-Stage would suffer heavy injuries from one slash.

However, the soul fragments knew that these ten slashes were still inferior to their combined attack. These soul fragments had clearly sacrificed everything, and their solid forms appeared somewhat ethereal. This kind of attack had drained them significantly.

Soul fragments were just that—fragments without spiritual energy. They relied entirely on powerful soul power, and all martial arts were supported by their souls. Therefore, casting martial arts meant consuming their soul power and weakening their strength.

"Crack..." Under Luo Tian's expectant gaze, the first slash immediately appeared before the gray storm and collided with it.

Thunder erupted. The powerful slash, upon contact with the gray storm, was instantly torn apart by the storm, producing a deafening roar. The black slash split into two, then four, and in an instant became countless black fragments, swept into the storm.

"Finished!" Luo Tian sighed longingly. He saw that although his black slash had weakened the storm slightly, it was still a world apart.

"Ultimately, one person's strength is impossible to match ninety-nine equals. To reach this point, the kid has already been remarkable!" The soul fragments discussed among themselves, their faces showing admiration. If it weren't for freedom, they wouldn't want to see such a prodigy perish.

But humans are selfish. These people had been sealed in this dark and endless palace for so long; their personalities hadn't become twisted, which was already good.

"One... two..." Black slashes collided with the storm repeatedly. Though they slowed the storm's advance and weakened its power, the storm's overwhelming might still could crush a Sage Mid-Stage.

"Fight!" Luo Tian's face flashed with ferocity. Not at others, but at himself. This feeling was rare for Luo Tian since entering the Early Sage Stage.

"Roar..." A black dragon emerged from Luo Tian's body, roaring as it wrapped around him. He didn't retreat but rushed toward the storm.

"Haha! This kid's crazy, charging straight into our attack!" Dozens of soul fragments laughed coldly, their gray eyes filled with mockery.

These people were just souls but could still feel the terrifying power of their combined attacks. Rushing toward it with his body was like seeking death.

As they discussed, Luo Tian's black figure instantly collided with the gray storm. The roaring sound echoed throughout the space.

Under the gaze of dozens of soul fragments, Luo Tian's black figure appeared like a small dot, swallowed by the gray storm.

"Dead!" The soul fragments didn't act but sighed, lamenting the death of a prodigy.

"Snort..." As Luo Tian rushed into the martial arts storm, he felt the terror of so many soul fragments' attacks. In an instant, his body was torn into several pieces; he would be completely destroyed in a moment.

"Can't die!" Luo Tian's eyes turned bloodshot. A desire for life made him unleash unprecedented desperation.

The dantian, which had already become barren, suddenly produced the sound of a trickle of water.

"Thousands of feet away. Just hold on!" Luo Tian transformed into a black dragon, rushing through the martial arts storm. Each martial arts attack from Early Sage Stage soul fragments struck Luo Tian, turning him into a bloodied figure with exposed white bones.

"One thousand feet... five hundred feet... one hundred feet..." Luo Tian seemed unaware, moving through the storm toward its end.

Though slow, it was only an instant. But for Luo Tian, this moment felt like years; his body could collapse at any time.

"It should be dead. I wonder if his body can regenerate!" The soul fragments discussed, waiting for the martial arts storm to subside.

"What is that!" In an instant, one soul fragment's gray eyes widened in disbelief. It stared at the martial arts storm.

No need for him to remind, others also noticed something unusual. A blood-colored figure suddenly emerged from the storm, dripping large amounts of blood and flesh.

"Is that kid a monster? This attack didn't kill him. How strong is his body! Comparable to the eight great beast clans of the Demon Domain!" Their minds were filled with shock as they spoke aloud.

"Cough... cough..." Luo Tian's face was pale, spitting blood. His entire body had thinned by three sizes, with no place unscathed. Bones were exposed everywhere, and blood continued to flow from his body.

"Still... not... over..." Luo Tian's eyes flashed with terrifying light. He looked like a reincarnated demon from hell, his dim and lifeless eyes scanning the soul fragments one by one. He spoke slowly.

Luo Tian's current state was extremely weak, but his lifeless eyes made the soul fragments shiver instinctively.

"Damn it, he's still alive!" The soul fragments gritted their teeth, watching Luo Tian slowly flying toward them.

The soul fragments' current state was slightly better than Luo Tian's, but not by much. Especially after being intimidated by Luo Tian's ruthless nature, they felt a chill.

"Kill... I don't believe he can still defeat us now!" The soul fragments roared, rushing toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, however, seemed unaffected. His golden Rupture Spear appeared in his hand and he rushed toward the dozens of soul fragments, attacking them. Including himself, no one used martial arts because his dantian was barren and the soul fragments' spiritual energy couldn't endure too much consumption. They had to rely on brute force.

Luo Tian knew his body was at its worst, but there was no choice. His golden Rupture Spear carried powerful tearing power and pierced into a soul fragment that hadn't reacted, turning it into a cloud of gray mist.

The cost was dozens of soul fragments striking him in the back, sending him flying thousands of feet away. His body trembled slightly, as if about to fall.

"They won't be able to last long. Kill!" The soul fragments, like demons, saw Luo Tian's extreme weakness and transformed into gray dragons, rushing toward him.

"Want to kill me, Luo Tian? You're not ready yet!" Luo Tian's face showed no fear. His body moved, but his eyes were filled with battle spirit. He took a step forward and rushed toward the soul fragments.

...

On another side, others also faced similar situations. Compared to Luo Tian's terrifying ninety-nine soul fragments, others were clearly much easier. Some faced nine, some more.

"Kill..." Chen Zhanbiao's face showed indifference, like a human beast. His body glowed with light. Though his cultivation was still at the Nine Source Supreme Stage, his formidable body terrified people. The nine soul fragments' attacks struck him with a humming sound but did not harm him at all.

Light filled the space. Sun Mengru, a divine clan member, looked coldly, illuminating the entire space with purification power. The twenty-something soul fragments surrounding her cried out in pain.

"Repression! You're a divine clan's goddess!" The soul fragments roared, annihilated by endless divine light.

"Hmph!" Sun Mengru sneered. Her gaze fell on a golden door appearing near her, and she took a step forward.

Everyone was fighting against the gray soul fragments. However, Luo Tian's battle was the most intense.

At this moment, Luo Tian's eyes were lifeless. Gray mist drifted in the vast space. After a period of fighting, Luo Tian had killed dozens of soul fragments but at great cost. He was barely human, standing under the stars with his chest heaving heavily. His gaze fell on the thirty-something soul fragments still surrounding him, with his golden Rupture Spear floating before him.

The thirty-something soul fragments were also trembling. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so tenacious, surviving their combined attacks and still having such combat power. Their fear was overwhelming!

"I have one last move!" Luo Tian knew he had no strength left to fight back. His eyes flashed with decisiveness.

Chapter 957: Eliminate the Enemies

In the empty space, Luo Tian panted heavily. His chest heaved violently as his eyes were lifeless. He gazed at the void.

Luo Tian knew he had no strength left to fight. He couldn't even lift the Rupture Spear. Standing there, his eyes gradually showed decisiveness.

"Kid, do you have any last words? If I escape, I'll fulfill your wish!" The soul fragments spoke, their gazes filled with admiration for Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's impact on them was immense. That he had survived their combined attacks was already a miracle. Not only did he survive, but he also fought them to the death. This was unprecedented.

Strength is always respected wherever it exists, an unchanging law since ancient times. Luo Tian had repeatedly faced death, seemingly on the verge of dying each time. Yet he always unleashed his potential and killed them.

"Terrifying! Such a prodigy's death is truly a pity. But we also want to live, so sorry!" The soul fragments' faces showed sorrow as they rushed toward the helpless Luo Tian.

"I have one last move. One move to kill you all!" Luo Tian's low roar echoed through the empty space, his voice filled with infinite confidence and resolve. The soul fragments' movements halted.

"What?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the soul fragments stopped their steps. Their gazes showed disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian.

If anyone else had said this, the soul fragments would have scoffed. But with Luo Tian saying it, they couldn't help but believe. Because Luo Tian had always shown such an indomitable spirit.

"Kid, you can't even hold your weapon now. Your soul fragments are also severely injured. What's your last trick? Don't toy with us; this delaying tactic isn't good at all!" The soul fragments spoke, their voices dismissive but faces filled with tension. No one dared to be the first to die.

"Although I'm like a useless person now, I still have myself!" Luo Tian's face showed coldness and ruthlessness. Combined with his bloodied body, exposed white bones, he looked like a devil from hell, terrifying.

"What do you mean by 'yourself'?" The soul fragments were confused. But shortly after, the thirty-something Early Sage Stage soul fragments seemed to realize something and screamed as they fled in all directions, their gray faces filled with fear.

"Kya kya... trying to run!" Luo Tian's face showed a pale smile. His gaze fell on the soul fragments fleeing in all directions. The sound of thunder echoed from his dantian.

"Self-Explosion..." The two words carried Luo Tian's immense determination. He knew if he didn't self-exploit, he truly had no chance.

The explosion's power was enough to annihilate these soul fragments after his exhaustion. Though his current state was bad, he might not be able to regenerate blood. But with the explosion, he had a chance of survival. If he didn't self-exploit, he would have no chance at all.

"Boom..." A deep sound echoed. Thunderous sounds spread from Luo Tian's dantian, and his entire body began to expand rapidly. His face was pale, a terrifying aura spreading outward.

Though the space seemed vast, it still had boundaries. An Early Sage Stage self-explosion could destroy a small continent. This space was no larger than a continent.

"Fool!" The soul fragments roared repeatedly, their faces filled with fear. They hadn't expected anyone to actually self-exploit. They knew the pain of self-explosion was unbearable, leading to mental breakdown.

Indeed, endless pain instantly invaded every corner of Luo Tian's body. He couldn't help but roar loudly, recalling the self-explosion of a hermit outside the ancient celestial palace. His face showed no fear, truly admirable.

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared to the sky, his long hair flying. His entire body slowly cracked open, expanding like a balloon. Every crack was a potential explosion of infinite power.

"You... can't escape!" Luo Tian laughed, expanding three times before exploding. His entire body vanished into the space.

At the same time, thunderous sounds echoed. A violent aura rose immediately after Luo Tian's self-explosion. It destroyed the heavens and earth, and the entire space was engulfed in endless darkness.

Invisible waves spread outward, rushing toward all directions. Every place it passed was swallowed by the space.

"Damn it!" The soul fragments roared, their voices filled with strong regret. More importantly, they were filled with the desire to live. Under the stimulus of life, all soul fragments seemed to unleash their potential. They became ethereal and launched powerful martial arts to block the waves that could annihilate them.

But soon, they were completely desperate. Their powerful martial arts, though strong, were useless against the overwhelming power of an Early Sage Stage self-explosion.

The powerful waves immediately reached the soul fragments' front. Upon contact, they were annihilated instantly without a single remnant.

After the invisible waves annihilated the soul fragments, they spread further until they hit the golden walls of the entire space. The thunderous sound echoed throughout the ancient celestial palace.

In another part of the palace, Diao Dezhu used his extreme speed to toy with several soul fragments. He moved like a ghost, constantly穿梭 (zhuān suō) through the empty space.

But in an instant, a strong tremor made Diao Dezhu reveal his form. He was the most unfortunate one, not knowing how it happened. His space was right next to Luo Tian's—Luo Tian's neighbor. Thus, the terrifying self-explosion power instantly passed through the golden walls and hit Diao Dezhu.

The soul fragments that had been toyed with by Diao Dezhu were finally annihilated, turning into gray mist and disappearing from Diao Dezhu's eyes.

"Pu..." Diao Dezhu showed admiration, watching the waves absorbed by the walls. The impact hit his body, making him spit out blood.

"Damn it! Don't let me know who's the neighbor. You're so strong, making me spit blood!" Diao Dezhu shouted aloud, cursing in the empty space. His voice turned into a purple light and rushed toward the appearing golden door.

In another part, all spaces adjacent to Luo Tian's space felt the terrifying waves from his self-explosion. Their faces were filled with fear.

"Who is it? Who could be so strong, causing such a commotion?" Sun Feiwen's face was filled with fear. He secretly wondered who it was, capable of such a commotion at the Early Sage Stage.

"Self-explosion!" Zhou Wei's brows furrowed slightly. He adjusted a green star map in his hand, observing the stars on it with thoughts of calculation.

Everyone was puzzled. Who could cause such a commotion? Someone who, at the Early Sage Stage level, could produce such terrifying waves. This person was definitely a prodigy of the era—without a doubt, beyond the Early Sage Stage.

In the empty space, it seemed to fall into endless darkness. In the center of the space, a green flame slowly burned, flickering as if it could go out at any moment. A golden spear emitted weak golden light, standing beside the green flame.

A drop of golden blood was wrapped in the flame. In the seemingly swallowed space, it stood out unusually. The entire space had no sound; it was terrifyingly silent.

"嗡……" The golden door slowly opened, as if it were a gateway to light or an exit from hell.

At the moment the golden door appeared, the green flame wrapped around the golden sacred blood slowly left the flame. It was like a star in the darkness, gradually emitting faint golden light.
