“What technique is this?” Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe exchanged bewildered glances. They had clearly felt their sword techniques slip beyond their control.

On the other side, a golden hand smashed through the three-headed dog’s assault, crushing its massive form and spewing black blood from each of its mouths. Yet the wounds were merely superficial.

“Boom…” Luo Tian, Long You Ran, the three-headed dog, and the Moon Wolf King seized the moment to descend into the Endless Forest.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and two pills dropped into the Moon Wolf King’s and three-headed dog’s mouths. He took a deep breath.

“Flee… he fled! Even with the combined efforts of Elder Duan, Senior Brother Yuan, and Senior Brother Zhu, he still escaped! He actually survived!” Several outer disciples gaped in terror, watching Luo Tian vanish into the forest.

“Truly formidable,” Gu Qiansnow loosened her grip, murmuring softly.

“You think entering the Endless Forest will save you from death?” Zhu Fengtian’s body trembled, and a stream of energy burst from the bloodied hole on his shoulder. The wound ceased bleeding as he barked into the forest.

“Pursue…” Duan Chengfeng sneered, his pride wounded by Luo Tian’s escape. He darted forward toward Luo Tian’s direction.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian’s face was cold as he formed a hand seal, and a golden mark rose from his head.

“Woo…” The Moon Wolf King stood, howling into the sky with regal authority.

“You’re faking it!” Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe scoffed, eyeing the green mark above Luo Tian’s head.

“Roar…” Just as they moved, a thunderous roar split the sky. A towering pillar of light erupted from the Endless Forest’s depths, and the dragon that had evaded them earlier was caught in its glow. It shrieked as its body shattered into a mist of blood.

“Buzz…” As the blood scattered, a surge of vitality spread outward, spreading through the forest like wildfire.

“This vitality… so dense!” All gasped in awe, stunned by its unprecedented strength.

“Crack…” As the vitality spread, trees erupted into rapid growth.

“A divine herb has emerged!” Duan Chengfeng’s eyes gleamed with joy, staring at the fading glow.

“Buzz…” Before Duan Chengfeng’s words faded, someone moved—dark light flickered as Gu Qiansnow surged forward toward the glow.

Chapter 1837: Shocking the Middle Stage of Immortality

“Who let you go?” Duan Chengfeng and Zhu Fengtian roared, stunned by Gu Qiansnow’s sudden speed. They hadn’t expected the usually silent woman to move so swiftly.

“Middle Stage of Immortality!” Their eyes widened as they sensed her cultivation. They hadn’t realized she had reached the Middle Stage of Immortality.

“Her talent is truly remarkable!” Zhu Fengtian’s eyes flashed with admiration, licking his lips as Yuan Xinghe stared intently at Gu Qiansnow’s path.

“But should we kill him first or seek the divine herb?” Duan Chengfeng and his companions exchanged glances, eyeing the dimming glow.

Unspoken tension formed between them—each coveted the herb’s immense value.

“I’ll seek the divine herb. You chase those people into the forest. I’ll decide how to divide it after obtaining it,” Duan Chengfeng coldly ordered, his authority evident as the senior elder.

“Fine…” Yuan Xinghe nodded reluctantly. Duan Chengfeng’s strength could easily overwhelm them.

“Go…” Duan Chengfeng took flight toward Gu Qiansnow’s direction.

Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe grimaced, shouting at the outer disciples: “Go!”

“Yes…” Nine figures surged into the Endless Forest. While Duan Chengfeng’s group debated, Luo Tian retrieved a pill and swallowed it.

“About time!” Luo Tian smiled. He had lingered at the Early Stage of Immortality for too long, and his prolonged stay was to obtain the Wujiji Xian Dan—only with vast spiritual energy could he cultivate the Wujiji Power.

“Still have time to take pills?” As Luo Tian swallowed the Wujiji Xian Dan, a crackling sound echoed. Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe had entered the Endless Forest, finding Luo Tian’s location.

“You’re really persistent!” Luo Tian, still refining the pill, glanced at them. Upon noticing Duan Chengfeng was absent, his heart eased—without Duan Chengfeng, the situation was manageable.

“Ying, have your disciples assist!” Luo Tian pointed, sending spiritual energy into the golden Beast Control Seal. The Moon Wolf King howled again.

“He didn’t run!” Zhu Fenghuo and Yuan Xinghe found Luo Tian’s location, surprised to see him seated calmly. They expected him to hide in the Endless Forest, but he sat like a statue.

“He must’ve been severely wounded by your two senior brothers or terrified by their might!” A male outer disciple sneered.

“Did you think his attacks were easy to withstand?” Others chimed in.

“Woo…” As they spoke, mournful sounds echoed around them. A surge of fierce energy swept the forest.

“Huh? What’s that green light?” They noticed green glows rising around them, confusion flickering on their faces.

“Damn! That’s not light—it’s wolf eyes!” Before they could react, a horde of fierce Moon Wolves emerged from the forest, surrounding Zhu Fenghuo and others.

“Roar…” As they marveled, countless Moon Wolves launched a terrifying assault.

The Moon Wolf King was the Endless Forest’s ruler. When Luo Tian left, he had only taken the Moon Wolf King. These wolves, transformed by the Beast Control Seal, had significantly enhanced their strength—some even reached the Early Stage of Immortality.

“Plop…” In an instant, three outer disciples were devoured by the wolves. Zhu Fenghuo and Yuan Xinghe countered fiercely, clashing with the Moon Wolves.

“Hope you don’t die,” Luo Tian murmured before refining the Wujiji Xian Dan amidst the wolf pack.

“Kill…” Zhu Fenghuo and others fought desperately within the wolf horde. Though their strength was celestial, the wolves’ numbers were insurmountable.

Screams echoed as a red-cloaked woman was torn apart. Zhu Fengtian’s face darkened—this woman had been in his arms, and he’d planned to claim her. Now she lay dead in the wolves’ jaws.

Others fought desperately, but all bore wounds growing worse. Death was imminent.

Despair filled their hearts—no chance to flee, as the wolves’ suicidal attacks never ceased. Even Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe were battered.

Within minutes, hundreds of Moon Wolves lay dead at their feet—trivial compared to the horde.

“I see! Luo Tian’s companion, the Moon Wolf King, is the Moon Wolf King!” They realized instantly, recalling Zhu Fengtian’s earlier injury to a blue wolf.

“He actually tamed the Moon Wolf King!” Their minds reeled, but they had no time to dwell. The wolves attacked relentlessly.

“Fly upward!” Zhu Fenghuo roared, forming a hand seal. Flames engulfed the surrounding wolves, reducing dozens to ash.

“Go!” Zhu Fenghuo didn’t hesitate. Continuing this would cost them their lives.

Yuan Xinghe and the remaining disciples took flight, escaping the chaos.

“Ten zhang… twenty zhang…” Outer disciples paled, counting their distance to escape the wolves’ range.

“Roar…” The wolf horde howled, and dozens of Moon Wolves took flight toward them.

“Crack…” Two outer disciples were decapitated mid-escape, their bodies dragged back to the pack.

“Hundred zhang…” Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe stood at a hundred zhang above the forest, gazing at the dense wolf horde. They inhaled sharply.

“Ha… ha…” Two figures, pale and wounded, stood under the sky. Their bodies trembled as if about to fall.

A man and a woman—within an hour, five had died in the wolves’ mouths. Their laughter was bitter, mocking their fate. They hadn’t expected a simple trial to turn into disaster.

“Cowards! Come up here!” The two, surviving the ordeal, shouted at the wolves, venting their fear. If they lingered longer, they’d join the others.

“Woo…” Their words barely faded when mournful sounds echoed from the wolves. Dozens of Early Stage of Immortality Moon Wolves spread their wings, rising slowly—stopping the two’s cries.

“What? The Moon Wolf King’s strongest is only at the Daoist Stage. How…?” The pair gaped, staring at the rising wolves.

“Mutation!” Zhu Fenghuo and Yuan Xinghe’s hearts tightened. Seeing the number of wolves, they sighed in relief.

“Two hundred!” Zhu Fenghuo frowned, his sword blazing. “Luo Tian, do you think a hundred Early Stage of Immortality wolves can stop me? If this is your last card, you may as well die!”

He charged into the wolf horde, his sword slicing through them like a reaper. Yuan Xinghe sneered, his sword cutting down wolves with each strike.

“Senior Brothers are truly divine!” Two outer disciples praised, watching Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe massacre the wolves.

“Woo…” The Moon Wolf King howled, hearing its kin die. It mourned the loss of its people.

“Luo Tian, I’ll catch you and flay your skin! Let you suffer!” Zhu Fenghuo cursed, trying to provoke Luo Tian into distraction.

“Buzz…” As Zhu Fengtian’s words ended, Luo Tian’s eyes opened—black and gold. A dual-colored vortex rose above his head, mirroring his gaze.

The world stilled. The Endless Forest’s spiritual energy surged violently, rushing toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 1838: The Ultimate Stage

“Breakthrough!” Zhu Fengtian and Yuan Xinghe’s faces paled. They stared at the vortex, recognizing its power—greater than their own.

“Buzz…” The golden vortex consumed all energy, and Luo Tian’s dantian transformed. His spiritual energy surged—half golden, half black.

“Middle Stage of Immortality… but not enough. I seek the Ultimate Stage of Middle Stage!” Luo Tian’s face was arrogant. Those who knew him would recognize this expression—Luo Tian was about to unleash his full power.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s body erupted with thunderous sound. Golden and black spiritual energy clashed violently.

His dantian seemed like the end of the world, shifting between day and night. The sky darkened with his dantian’s transformation.

“Wujiji Power! How did he obtain it?” Zhu Fenghuo and Yuan Xinghe’s faces finally showed shock, staring at Luo Tian’s body emitting thunderous sounds.

“The Ultimate Stage! He’s pushing through it!” They gasped, their attacks intensifying. They knew the Ultimate Stage was invincible at its level—Cen Weihong, ranked first on the Dragon榜, was an Ultimate Stage cultivator. Remembering his power, they shivered.

“Don’t let him succeed! If he does, we won’t survive!” Knowing they were now enemies, Zhu Fenghuo and Yuan Xinghe held nothing back. Their attacks grew fiercer, and the Moon Wolves suffered heavier losses.

“Senior Brothers are truly divine! How easy to break through the Ultimate Stage?” Two outer disciples mocked.

“Roar…” The Moon Wolf King could no longer endure its kin’s slaughter. It howled, charging Zhu Fenghuo.

The three-headed dog also roared, its bond with the Moon Wolf King deep. Seeing it attack Zhu Fenghuo, it charged Yuan Xinghe.

The Moon Wolf King’s jaws spat a black moon, crushing Zhu Fenghuo like a void.

“Beast! You dare stop me?” Zhu Fenghuo sneered. A Moon Wolf King was strong, but to him, it was still a beast.

Meanwhile, the three-headed dog attacked Yuan Xinghe. Stronger than the Moon Wolf King, each strike left Yuan Xinghe battered. His attacks on the three-headed dog only left white marks, but it grimaced in pain.

“Endless Heaven and Earth, the Way has no fixed path. The Wujiji Path reigns supreme…” Luo Tian’s mind echoed with the Dao, his dantian constantly shifting. Sweat dripped from his face.

“Crack!” A sharp sound echoed. If anyone noticed, they’d be stunned—Luo Tian’s dantian violently collided and shattered.

“Painful!” Even with his resolve, Luo Tian shivered. But he gritted his teeth—dantian shattering was the first step. The next was reassembling it.

“Condense!” Luo Tian roared, his spiritual awareness enveloping the dual-colored vortex. It spun rapidly.

“Buzz…” The vortex evolved strangely, forming a barrier replacing his dantian.

“Condense!” Luo Tian barked. The barrier exploded, then reformed—stronger this time.

“Condense… condense…” Repeatedly, his spiritual energy collided and fused. His dantian repeatedly shattered and reformed, becoming impossibly strong.

Meanwhile, the three-headed dog and Moon Wolf King faced heavy suppression. Blood splattered—especially the Moon Wolf King, its body riddled with wounds. Its wings were severed by Zhu Fenghuo.

“Woo…” Zhu Fenghuo’s sword cleaved through the Moon Wolf King, nearly splitting it. The Moon Wolf King cried out, crashing into the ground.

“Beast!” Zhu Fenghuo sneered, standing firm despite being bitten by the Moon Wolf King.

“Die!” Zhu Fenghuo sneered, another fiery sword strike aimed at the Moon Wolf King.

“Plop… plop…” The wolves cried, their bodies severed. Blood and white smoke rose as dozens of Early Stage of Immortality wolves were slain.

“Roar…” The three-headed dog howled, spitting out three black pearls. They radiated immense pressure, making Zhu Fenghuo and Yuan Xinghe pale.

“Internal Organs! It’s a King-Grade Beast!” Zhu Fenghuo gasped, staring at the three-headed dog.

“Now I understand why it matched Yuan Xinghe evenly!” Zhu Fenghuo’s eyes burned with desire, gazing at the three black pearls.

Internal Organs were exclusive to King-Grade Beasts. They were inheritance pearls, rare in the spiritual world. A beast’s Internal Organs contained its entire cultivation and were invaluable to humans.

If the three-headed dog was a King-Grade Beast in Tianmen Sect, they’d worship it, pouring all resources into its growth. A mature King-Grade Beast could rival an Immortal King.

In the Upper Three Heavens, there was a Beasts Mountain. Though no Immortal Kings resided there, it housed one mature King-Grade Beast—hence its place among the Nine Heavens.

“Luck! First a divine herb, then a King-Grade Beast. If we subdue these three heads, even the divine herb is trash!” Zhu Fenghuo and Yuan Xinghe’s eyes gleamed with excitement.

“Buzz…” As they marveled, two terrifying pulses reached their senses—one from the three-headed dog’s Internal Organs, another from Luo Tian’s rising aura.

“First kill Luo Tian, then decide who subdues the three-headed dog!” Zhu Fenghuo ordered. His red sword pierced toward Luo Tian.

“Night, I am the King!” Yuan Xinghe’s face was cold. He ascended into the dark night, a star rising. His hands formed seals, and a green meteor shot toward the black pearls.

“Crack…” The meteor collided with the pearls, but Yuan Xinghe’s body trembled. His injuries were severe.

“Luo Tian!” Long Youran, anxious, saw Zhu Fengtian’s sword approach. She dashed forward, summoning four golden dragons to block his path.

“Overconfident!” Zhu Fengtian’s face was cold. His sword danced, engulfed in fire like a flame king. It struck the four dragons.

“Boom… boom…” The attacks were annihilated, dispersing into spiritual energy.

Zhu Fengtian reached Luo Tian instantly. Long Youran stood defiantly before him.

“If you seek death, I’ll grant it!” Zhu Fengtian showed no mercy. His sword pierced Long Youran.

“Ten zhang… five zhang…” The red sword, hot with energy, appeared before her. She had no time to react—when she saw Zhu Fengtian’s form, the sword was a foot from her throat. Her hair smelled of charred.

“Overconfident is you!” As the sword neared her throat, a cold voice echoed. A golden hand appeared before Long Youran, seizing the sword.

“What!” Zhu Fengtian’s eyes widened. He hadn’t expected anyone to block his full attack—not even the Eight Elders could do that.

“Crush…” The sword bent, forming an arc before stopping at Long Youran’s front. It didn’t advance.

“After being bullied so long, it’s my turn!” Luo Tian stood before Long Youran. His eyes flashed with killing intent. “I’ll punch you!”

Chapter 1839: The King in the Night

Luo Tian’s dantian was ten times sturdier. He was confident even a Late Stage of Immortality cultivator couldn’t destroy it.

Inside his dantian, a golden pearl hovered. Though small, it contained explosive power—its explosion would destroy heaven and earth.

Luo Tian felt unusually strong. Even against Duan Chengfeng, he had a chance to fight—perhaps even win. If not, Duan Chengfeng would be powerless.

But the greatest surprise was the golden book in his mind. With his golden dantian formed, he felt he could tap into the power of the Epoch Book.

“A qualitative leap. Now I fear no one!” Luo Tian’s face was cold as he punched Zhu Fengtian.

“Buzz…” The golden fist struck Zhu Fengtian, who had previously been underestimated. His body recoiled, chest caved in, and he flew backward.

Blood spattered. Zhu Fengtian stood pale under the sky, gazing at Luo Tian’s towering form.

“He truly reached the Ultimate Stage!” Zhu Fengtian trembled. The feeling of Luo Tian was terrifying—instinctive fear, even his spiritual energy slowed under Luo Tian’s might. This was the power of an Ultimate Stage cultivator—complete碾压 at their level, even capable of defeating higher ranks.

“My heavens! I’ve seen an Ultimate Stage genius!” The two outer disciples trembled, staring at Luo Tian. His aura terrified them.

“Kill!” Luo Tian took flight, stepping through the void. He vanished from his spot, rushing toward Zhu Fengtian with the Rupture Spear.

“Flee!” Zhu Fengtian had no fight. Luo Tian’s punch had wounded him severely. Continuing would mean death.

“Flee!” The two outer disciples fled with Zhu Fengtian. They regretted joining him—none expected Luo Tian, already in a death trap, to turn the tide and break through the legendary Ultimate Stage.

“None will escape!” Luo Tian coldly ordered. As he flew, he formed a hand seal. The Beast Control Seal rose, and over thirty Early Stage of Immortality Moon Wolves howled, chasing the two outer disciples. Luo Tian appeared behind Zhu Fengtian instantly, stabbing him with the Rupture Spear.

“Seven Stars Holy Flame Shield!” Zhu Fengtian sensed danger. His crimson flames formed a shield behind him.

“Flame, I am the king!” Luo Tian sneered. His flame mark glowed, and the Rupture Spear didn’t stop. It pierced the shield, sucking the crimson flames into his body.

The Rupture Spear continued, striking Zhu Fengtian’s back. He staggered.

“Die!” Zhu Fengtian knew he couldn’t escape. He turned, his sword blazing with ten thousand red glows.

“Flame Sword Technique!” Zhu Fengtian roared, aiming a fatal strike. He poured all his spiritual energy and even burned his blood to sustain himself.

“Boom… boom…” Crimson flames erupted, lighting the sky. The red sword slash swept toward Luo Tian.

“Is this a death match?” Luo Tian’s face was cold. He formed seals, his body expanding to hundreds of zhang. His golden foot stomped down.

“Boom…” The seven-step stomp combined with his physical strength and solid spiritual energy. It crushed the sky-high sword slash.

“Boom…” Zhu Fengtian’s body was stomped into the ground, lying like a pile of dog excrement.

“Did you want to kill me?” Luo Tian returned to normal size, standing before Zhu Fengtian. His eyes were cold.

Zhu Fengtian said nothing. He lay motionless, gasping with blood spitting out. He was near death.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s foot moved again, crushing Zhu Fengtian into a mist of blood.

“Buzz…” Crimson flames rose. A red flame emerged from the blood, seemingly harmless but radiating world-destroying power.

“Sky Flame. If it devours you, I’ll ascend a level!” Luo Tian smiled. The situation was under control. He formed seals, and Qi appeared beside him.

“Delicious!” Qi’s face lit up, seeing the red flame. He ran toward it, grabbing it.

Trembling—this flame that could burn everything trembled before Qi. It was grabbed and swallowed.

“Eat slowly. I’ll do other things!” Luo Tian ignored Qi, who had devoured the Seven Stars Sky Flame. He turned to Yuan Xinghe battling the three-headed dog.

“Not bad. Better than Zhu Fengtian!” Luo Tian gazed at Yuan Xinghe.

Yuan Xinghe continuously summoned stars, clashing with the three-headed dog’s Internal Organs. Though strong, they were one level below Yuan Xinghe. They temporarily held him back but at great cost—his silver eyes weakened.

“Black, I’ll handle it!” Luo Tian took flight, standing before the three-headed dog. He gazed at Yuan Xinghe.

“Boom…” The three-headed dog inhaled, drawing its three black Internal Organs back. Its massive body landed on the ground, panting.

“You want to avenge your useless brother?” Luo Tian smiled, locking Yuan Xinghe in place.

“Yes. The dragon’s reverse scales—my brother is my reverse scale. You crippled his legs, so I’ll take your life!” Yuan Xinghe’s face was cold. Though Luo Tian had reached the Ultimate Stage, he wasn’t afraid—nighttime favored him.

“Don’t you fear me?” Luo Tian’s face showed interest. He hadn’t expected the opponent to be so fearless.

“The Ultimate Stage, like Cen Weihong ranked first on the Dragon榜. I lost to him, badly!”

“But three years later, my strength improved significantly. Also, our match was in daylight—not my prime time. So I still had resentment!” Yuan Xinghe’s eyes burned with battle and resentment.

“Then what?” Luo Tian coldly stared. He never spared those who sought his death.

“Then I want to see if my strongest self can kill an Ultimate Stage!” Yuan Xinghe roared, then vanished into the stars, appearing before Luo Tian.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. He punched, the sound echoing in the silent Endless Forest.

“Good! Truly an Ultimate Stage!” Yuan Xinghe roared, his hands moving. The sky darkened instantly. Stars rose, shining on Yuan Xinghe’s body. He didn’t hesitate and flew toward Luo Tian.

“Boom… boom…” The clash echoed, their hundred blows shaking the vast stars.

The invisible waves battered the forest below, leaving it in ruins.

“Cough… cough…” Yuan Xinghe spat blood. His body was riddled with cracks, his stars dimming.

“Few have matched my physical strength to this extent since I entered the spiritual world!” Luo Tian shook his numb fist, gazing at Yuan Xinghe’s pale face.

“Since you entered the spiritual world?” Yuan Xinghe’s eyes widened, confusion flickering.

“Correct! The ascended ones are stronger than native spiritual world cultivators at the same level!” Yuan Xinghe’s eyes flashed with light.

“Capturing you and delivering you to the Upper Three Heavens would be a great achievement!” Yuan Xinghe murmured, his hands moving again. One hundred and eight stars rose above him.

“I am the king of night. In darkness, I’m invincible!” Yuan Xinghe roared, stars swirling, forming a powerful aura above him.

“King of Night? Ha! Let me show you my true strength. Who is the king of night?” Luo Tian’s face showed disdain.

Chapter 1840: The River of Annihilation

“In this darkness, all stars are my power. What will you use to oppose me?” Yuan Xinghe’s face was confident, his body radiating waves. Stars enveloped him again, instantly healing his injuries from the clash with Luo Tian.

“One strike to end you—River of Annihilation!” Yuan Xinghe coldly ordered. His spiritual energy surged violently, forming a star river stretching across the cosmos. Stars were embedded within it.

“Rippling… rippling…” The vast river seemed to flow from the heavens, pressing with immense pressure. It contained Yuan Xinghe’s entire cultivation. He was confident this move could crush any Middle Stage of Immortality.

This technique had been reserved for Cen Weihong, but Luo Tian’s tenacity forced Yuan Xinghe to use it early.

“A terrifying technique. It should rival a Middle Stage of Immortal Technique!” Luo Tian marveled, watching Yuan Xinghe’s pale face.

“Unfortunately…” Luo Tian’s hands moved. A black moon rose from his head, coldness spreading across the seal, as if freezing souls.
