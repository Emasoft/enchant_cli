"Xuan-ranked weapon," he mused. "It would cost a city lord his entire fortune to acquire such a blade. Yet Luo Tian had it in his hands so easily. Although Dong Sansi's eyes were sharp within the Five Elements Sect, sharpness of vision did not equate to possessing an Xuan-ranked weapon."

Dong Sansi was certain that the Nameless Blade would be coveted even by Bone-Devouring Stage masters outside.

"I..." Dong Sansi was at a loss for words.

At this moment, all his previous resentment from serving Luo Tian with alchemical tasks within the Five Elements Sect vanished. He felt it was worth every sacrifice to serve such a man.

Luo Tian patted Dong Sansi's shoulder. "Some things are better left unspoken." He glanced at Dong Sansi before bowing to the Five Elements Sect disciples.

"Brothers, although Dong Sansi obtained the Nameless Blade, I Luo Tian swear that if you followed me here on this quest, none of you will leave empty-handed. Even if we find nothing in the Great An Forest, I shall ensure your satisfaction upon returning to the sect."

Hearing Luo Tian's assurance, the Five Elements Sect disciples understood his relationship with Dong Sansi. They harbored no great resentment; after all, Luo Tian's word was his bond.

Luo Tian turned and observed the Rending Sky Spear still absorbing the red metal's sharpness. He marveled at what this red metal could be, so effortlessly devoured by the spear with no visible change.

"Uncle! What should we do with these three?" Wang Tianxiang asked, a playful smirk on his face as he glanced at Lan Yichen and others.

Luo Tian's heart stirred with mischief. He produced several crimson pills from his sleeve, recalling Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's faces.

"Ah... I wonder how you're faring," Luo Tian sighed softly.

The pills in his hand were the poison pills Gu Lei had once crafted—pills that induced hallucinations upon consumption. When Gu Lei had given them to him, he'd marveled at the boy's genius for creating such a concoction.

With an odd expression, he placed the pills into the mouths of Lan Yichen and others who were barely conscious. He watched their reactions with amusement.

Before the pills' effects took hold, a thunderous rumble echoed from the third floor above. It seemed to shake the second floor's roof.

"Third floor has someone!" Wang Tianxiang hadn't expected anyone to be there. But his gaze immediately hardened.

"Gu Xueming!" Luo Tian's mind conjured Gu Xueying's image. Clearly, he wasn't in the second floor. Therefore, this Gu Xueying must be on the third.

"Let's go," Luo Tian whispered to his companions, ignoring the Rending Sky Spear and those who had swallowed the pills.

Luo Tian felt an eerie sense of foreboding about Gu Xueying. Though he couldn't pinpoint the exact nature of this unease, seeing how Gu Xueying treated his companions with such cruelty and disregard for life made it clear he was no good man.

As they ascended the stairs, their astonishment deepened. In the center of the room stood a massive bronze cauldron. Gu Xueying sat cross-legged beside it, one hand resting on the cauldron's surface while the other was raised. His eyes were closed, and waves of energy radiated from both him and the cauldron.

Luo Tian recognized this energy—it wasn't spiritual qi but rather from one's mind-sense. Around Gu Xueying were countless array flags, their expressions strange.

The weapons and armor scattered around the room suggested Gu Xueying had known this cauldron was most important. He'd come directly to the third floor without even collecting the Nameless Blade from the second or the weapons around the third.

Luo Tian stood before the dense array flags, his expression grave.

"This Gu Xueying's mastery of arrays is truly a genius. He's managed to set up such an intricate array in so short a time!" Wang Tianxiang marveled at the dense array flags surrounding them.

While arrays and talismans were less popular than alchemy, people knew that once one reached a certain level of strength, arrays and talismans became secondary. After all, brute force could break any array. Alchemists were different—alchemy was a shortcut to power, which made alchemists hold higher status than the other two professions.

Yet this array Gu Xueying had set was clearly of the fourth-tier. Even Luo Tian found it challenging to break.

"Can't let Gu Xueying succeed!" A sense of danger stirred in Luo Tian's heart.

With that thought, his hands moved swiftly. The Five Elements' cycle of generation formed the King's Seal in his palm. He roared and slammed it against Gu Xueying's array barrier.

The thunderous explosion echoed through the third floor of the tree hole. Luo Tian saw the array tremble slightly but not break. His expression darkened.

Inside the array, Gu Xueying opened his eyes and gazed at Luo Tian's group. A faint smile played on his lips, especially when he looked at Luo Tian—as if a beast eyeing its prey. Then he closed his eyes again.

Luo Tian's heart trembled upon seeing Gu Xueying's gaze. He felt an ancient沧桑 (ancient desolation) within those eyes. He'd felt this same sensation before—once from the残魂 (residual soul) of a yellow-haired old man at the Ascending Stairs, and again from his master Zhang Daotian's spirit body.

"Residual soul taking over a body, rebirth through another!" The thought echoed in Luo Tian's mind. He realized the young Gu Xueying might house a monster's residual soul. This thought made his body shiver involuntarily.

"Of course he could recognize the array's name, 'Hun Tian Bu Yuan Array' (Heaven-Complementing Array), and set up such an intricate array. He also dismissed the weapons in the second and third floors!" Luo Tian suddenly understood.

"Moreover, he wants to steal my body?" A more terrifying thought crossed Luo Tian's mind.

With that, he held nothing back. His spiritual energy surged as the King's Seal formed again. He shouted to his companions, "Everyone, attack together!"

Chapter 142: Soul-Subduing Cauldron

Chapter 142: Soul-Subduing Cauldron

Hearing the gravity in Luo Tian's voice, the others didn't hesitate. They unleashed their secret techniques.

Dong Sansi wielded the Nameless Blade, channeling all his spiritual energy into it. A massive blade of light shot skyward, far surpassing the power of others' techniques.

Seeing the Nameless Blade's immense power in Dong Sansi's hands, the others envied him.

"Boom..." The explosion echoed again. To their surprise, even with all their combined strength, Gu Xueying's array remained unbroken.

Luo Tian's expression grew more serious. At that moment, a humming sound echoed in their ears. Luo Tian heard it and his eyes lit up with joy: "Have you finished eating? Then come to work!"

A dark light shot from the stairwell, like lightning. Its sound grew louder until it appeared in Luo Tian's hand.

"What level of weapon are you now, I wonder?"

Luo Tian lightly caressed the Rending Sky Spear's shaft, a smile on his face.

At this moment, the spear no longer had its pure black color. Within it were faint red patterns. Though Luo Tian's eyes could not discern what these patterns were, the sharpness radiating from its tip was chilling.

"This array... will it break after your evolution?" Luo Tian murmured to himself.

"Buzz..." The Rending Sky Spear trembled in Luo Tian's hand, as if expressing its disdain for being underestimated. A sense of contempt entered Luo Tian's mind.

This thought made Luo Tian's body tremble slightly. The Rending Sky Spear had developed its own consciousness and could clearly express itself to him!

Wang Tianxiang and others looked at the black spear in Luo Tian's hand, especially its tip. The炼体境 (Body-Refining Stage) disciples felt a sense of danger.

When the Rending Sky Spear returned to Luo Tian's hands, the Nameless Blade in Dong Sansi's hand trembled unnaturally.

Dong Sansi was shocked. This Nameless Blade was an Xuan-ranked weapon, albeit a low-tier one. Yet it trembled in fear! What level was Luo Tian's Rending Sky Spear?

Dong Sansi had seen Luo Tian use the Rending Sky Spear before, but never had he felt such fear in his heart.

"Alright, let's try," Luo Tian smiled slightly and raised the Rending Sky Spear.

In an instant, it transformed into a golden serpent. Its fierce teeth glinted with sharpness. It opened its maw wide and bit into Gu Xueying's array barrier.

Four poison fangs, sharp with energy, pierced the barrier like nails.

Seeing this, Luo Tian's face lit up. He poured more spiritual energy into the Rending Sky Spear.

"Crack..." A clear sound echoed from the array barrier.

"Pound!" At that moment, two of Gu Xueying's array flags turned to dust and vanished into the air.

"Four... eight... thirty-six..." The more the array broke, the more flags vanished.

"Eighty-eight!" In a few breaths, all eighty-eight array flags around Gu Xueying vanished into the world, revealing his figure before them.

"Boom..." At the moment the array broke, a powerful spiritual sense冲击 (impact) surged toward Luo Tian's group.

Luo Tian had no time to think. His spiritual sense at the识海 (Mind Sea) level surged out, neutralizing this powerful冲击.

"Damn!" Gu Xueying naturally knew what had happened outside. But he was in the critical phase. If he could just hold on a little longer, he would succeed.

"Haha! Old man, you finally fell behind. You still lack the skill to subdue my Soul-Subduing Cauldron!" A weak voice echoed in Gu Xueying's mind.

"Hmph. I'll agree to your terms, but only if you let me take this body!" Gu Xueying's voice echoed in his mind.

"Spit! You're the one who took another's body. I'm not that shameless. To merge my residual soul and subdue the Soul-Subduing Cauldron? Not in this lifetime!" Before Gu Xueying could continue, the weak voice replied.

"Hmph. Even if I lose this body, it's worth it to obtain the Soul-Subduing Cauldron!" Gu Xueying sneered and poured all his spiritual soul into this space.

At that moment, Luo Tian's group was unaware of Gu Xueying's state. The powerful spiritual sense冲击 hadn't dissipated but had lessened.

Though it had lessened, it still made Dong Sansi and others stagger. Only Luo Tian stood firm.

"Fall back!" Luo Tian ordered, then moved toward Gu Xueying without hesitation. His hands changed rapidly.

"Capture Soul Seal!" The seal formed in Luo Tian's hand. He cautiously pushed it forward.

"Boom!" The Capture Soul Seal landed squarely on Gu Xueying's head.

"Puke!" Gu Xueying spat blood. He was furious.

Though he didn't care about his body's injuries, he did care about his spiritual sense being harmed. His current spiritual sense was locked in a battle with another residual soul inside the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. This Capture Soul Seal could not be dodged.

"Howl..." In pain, Gu Xueying's soul was instantly torn apart by another soul.

"Luo Tian, you little bastard! Wait until I finish off this old man! You'll wish for death but won't get it!" Gu Xueying roared and charged toward the soul he called Cui Yuanyang.

"Ha! You're being disturbed by outsiders!" Cui Yuanyang's soul laughed weakly. Clearly, he was now at his limit and hoped the outside people would continue to disturb Gu Xueying so he could hold on a little longer!

Luo Tian was puzzled by Gu Xueying's behavior. Even after being hit by the Capture Soul Seal, he remained indifferent.

He extended his hand and gently touched the bronze cauldron.

This touch was no small matter. Luo Tian felt a sharp pain in his head, as if his soul were being pulled out. A powerful suction force dragged him into the cauldron.

"Son of a bitch!" Gu Xueying felt another soul inside the cauldron and knew it was that damned Luo Tian. His hatred for Luo Tian had reached its peak, but Cui Yuanyang's soul still clung to him, preventing him from moving.

Chapter 143: Struggle

Chapter 143: Struggle

Luo Tian gazed around in confusion. He had never appeared in this form before. After adapting, he saw two gray figures constantly tearing at each other.

One was clearly much stronger than the other. It was only a matter of time before it was consumed.

Luo Tian flew toward the two souls. Seeing them constantly tear at each other, he didn't know their relationship. However, on one of the souls, he felt a familiar aura. He knew the strong one was Gu Xueying.

"Little friend, come help me! Otherwise we'll both disappear!" Cui Yuanyang's weak voice echoed in this strange space.

"Luo Tian, I promise to subdue this old man. After we get out, we'll be enemies!" Gu Xueying heard Cui Yuanyang's plea and became anxious. If he could just get one more minute, he would completely consume Cui Yuanyang's residual soul. Then his spiritual soul would definitely grow stronger.

Luo Tian heard both of their words and didn't believe Gu Xueying's lies. The greed in Gu Xueying's eyes before was clear. Luo Tian believed if Gu Xueying truly consumed that residual soul, he would also be devoured. Then his physical body outside could naturally merge with it.

Thinking this, Luo Tian didn't hesitate and quickly joined the battle.

"Hmph. Adding another kid won't change anything. I'll just finish both of you off!" Gu Xueying sneered, his words casual but his mind serious.

Gu Xueying was a residual soul himself. He had become powerful by consuming the previous Gu Xueying's soul.

Luo Tian was different. His strong spiritual sense naturally made his soul powerful. And since Luo Tian had a complete soul, its strength was comparable to Gu Xueying's.

With Luo Tian's addition, Gu Xueying immediately fell behind. He was constantly devoured by Luo Tian and Cui Yuanyang.

The more they grew stronger, the weaker Gu Xueying became.

Gu Xueying was anxious but helpless. He could only let Luo Tian and Cui Yuanyang devour him until he was left with a faint breath.

"Luo Tian, I remember this grudge. You think I'm dead? Hmph! When I recover to my peak, I'll kill you. And everyone related to you!" Gu Xueying's final cold words echoed.

Luo Tian felt a heavy weight in his heart upon hearing Gu Xueying's dark voice. Being targeted by such a terrifying person would mean no peace in the future.

"Don't be afraid, little friend. He's just talking nonsense. If he could recover so easily, I would have already done so!" Cui Yuanyang knew what Luo Tian was thinking and laughed.

"Please, elder, explain. Why are we in this situation? I'm only at the Body-Refining Stage and haven't reached the level where a dead body's residual soul can survive!" The gray Luo Tian bowed and asked.

"What stage is it above the Yuan Ling Stage?" Cui Yuanyang asked.

"Ji Po (Soul-Refining)!" Luo Tian wasn't a novice anymore. He clearly knew there were higher stages beyond the Yuan Ling Stage.

"Correct. The stage above Yuan Ling is Ji Po, and above that is Ning Hun (Soul-Consolidation). Once at the Soul-Consolidation Stage, one can regenerate their residual soul even if their physical body dies. This is what people call 'rebirth through another's body' or 'soul-stealing'!" Cui Yuanyang's voice echoed.

"At the Soul-Consolidation Stage, one can gather seven souls. If killed, they can escape by burning their soul energy. How many souls escape depends on fate. If none escape, then the Soul-Consolidation Stage practitioner is completely dead!" Cui Yuanyang continued without waiting for Luo Tian to speak.

"Then, elder... what about you?" Luo Tian asked softly.

"In fact, if one is killed by an enemy, it's hard to escape. After all, those who kill a Soul-Consolidation Stage practitioner are stronger than them. That's why few people can achieve rebirth through another's body in this world. I barely escaped with one soul, protected by this Soul-Subduing Cauldron. Otherwise, I would have already vanished into the world!" Cui Yuanyang said with a sigh.

Luo Tian was amazed at the Soul-Subduing Cauldron's power. To protect a residual soul from a Soul-Consolidation Stage practitioner, it must be extremely abnormal. Luo Tian knew that if he met a Soul-Consolidation Stage practitioner, they could kill him with just a finger.

"This person you call Gu Xueying isn't actually named Gu Xueying. His real name is Bu Jingtian. He was also my enemy. We both died in a fight. His luck was better—he escaped with two souls. I, even with the protection of this Soul-Subduing Cauldron, only have this residual soul!" Cui Yuanyang's voice carried a sense of nostalgia and沧桑 (ancient desolation).

Luo Tian was shocked by the depth of their hatred. They had both died in a mutual destruction, but he felt relieved that only two souls had escaped from Bu Jingtian. If more had escaped, it would have caused endless trouble for him.

"What should I do, elder? How can I get out?" Luo Tian felt uncomfortable in the cauldron's environment and wanted to leave as soon as possible.

"Don't worry, little friend. You can leave anytime. However, I have a request for you. Please take this Soul-Subduing Cauldron and find it a new master. I fear that if Bu Jingtian returns here, it will be trouble!" Cui Yuanyang said to Luo Tian.

"Oh? How do I subdue this Soul-Subduing Cauldron?" Luo Tian asked softly, clearly interested in the rare treasure.

"I can only tell you that treasures have souls. Whether you can subdue it after leaving depends on your luck. I also spent a lot of effort to subdue it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been left with just this residual soul during my fight with Bu Jingtian!"

Cui Yuanyang's face carried memories.

"Hmph! Old man, is your body so easy to take?"

Luo Tian roared, his voice like a rolling thunder echoing within the small Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Cui Yuanyang instinctively took a few steps back, his face filled with disbelief. His actions had been so subtle, yet Luo Tian still discovered some clues.

"Hmph! You spent so long to lure me in with words, but secretly sent a soul fragment to take over my body? I wasn't mistaken, was I?" Luo Tian's voice carried disdain. His face, though blurry, showed a sneer.

Chapter 144: Conclusion

Chapter 144: Conclusion

Luo Tian had always kept a watchful eye on this old monster. He couldn't afford to be careless. He had been quietly observing Cui Yuanyang, and although the latter's soul energy was slightly reduced, it had still been noticed by Luo Tian. He just needed to observe where Cui Yuanyang's soul energy was escaping.

Once Luo Tian discovered the path Cui Yuanyang took, he knew that to escape, he had to devour this old man. He must have been brought into the cauldron by this old man using the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. Otherwise, he wouldn't have entered it without reason.

Thinking this through, Luo Tian rushed toward Cui Yuanyang with madness.

Luo Tian was right—only one person could escape. Cui Yuanyang had managed to escape because of his familiarity with the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, allowing a tiny soul fragment to escape from it.

"Are you crazy, Luo Tian!" Seeing Luo Tian attack him, Cui Yuanyang panicked and fled.

Cui Yuanyang's plan was to hold Luo Tian here, using that tiny soul fragment to steal his body. The rest would be easy. Although the soul fragment was just a tiny bit, he had confidence in regaining his strength.

At first, he hadn't intended to steal Luo Tian's body. But when Bu Jingtian said that Luo Tian was a Five Elements Body, he had become determined. A Five Elements Body! If it were his, with his previous stage and experience, he could possibly return to the Soul-Consolidation Stage. Even more, there was a chance of entering that legendary stage—Jie Zun (World-尊).

Under such temptation, Cui Yuanyang decided to take the risk. Otherwise, living in this Soul-Subduing Cauldron endlessly was worse than death.

Luo Tian chased Cui Yuanyang's residual soul with madness. At this point, Luo Tian had devoured most of Bu Jingtian's residual soul, making him far stronger than Cui Yuanyang.

Not long after, Cui Yuanyang's residual soul was mostly devoured. Luo Tian held it in his hand.

"Damn! I was so close to succeeding!" Cui Yuanyang's face showed a grimace of hatred. His soul had controlled most of Luo Tian's body, just missing the head. But Luo Tian's head seemed to be protected by something, making it impossible to control.

"Hmph! Old man, I was going to let you go. But you were so cunning. It seems I can't leave you alive!"

Luo Tian said with a low laugh.

"Luo Tian, let me go! I'll tell you where there's opportunity. I'll guide your cultivation. With your talent, you can definitely reach the Soul-Consolidation Stage. Even possibly enter that legendary stage—Jie Zun!" Cui Yuanyang, held in Luo Tian's hand, said fearfully.

"Oh? Where is this opportunity? Jie Zun?" Luo Tian's face showed a hint of interest.

"Yes, yes! I'll tell you everything I know. Just let me live!" Cui Yuanyang, seeing Luo Tian's interest, grabbed the last straw and desperately persuaded him.

"Needless!" Luo Tian didn't want to waste time. He opened his mouth and completely devoured Cui Yuanyang's residual soul within the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

At the moment Luo Tian devoured Cui Yuanyang's residual soul, a powerful repulsion force pushed his soul out of the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

Luo Tian's soul instantly returned to his head's Mind Sea. He realized his body was uncontrollable, knowing it had been taken over by the last remaining fragment of Cui Yuanyang's soul.

"Get out!" Luo Tian roared, instantly pushing Cui Yuanyang's residual soul out of his body.

He extended his hand, wrapping a fierce fire-element spiritual energy around Cui Yuanyang's soul fragment. He revealed Cui Yuanyang's terrified face.

"Old man, you wanted to trick me? Die!" Without caring about Cui Yuanyang's begging expression, he transformed the spiritual energy into fire. A former Soul-Consolidation Stage master was reduced to a wisp of white smoke, vanishing into the air.

"Ah..." Luo Tian took a deep breath. Although he had won inside the cauldron, thinking about this strange encounter made him feel shaken. He looked at the mysterious Soul-Subduing Cauldron and wore a faint smile.

Wang Tianxiang and others saw Luo Tian open his eyes, and the pressure around them disappeared. They approached Luo Tian.

But Luo Tian seemed to ignore Wang Tianxiang and Dong Sansi, slightly closing his eyes before opening them again. His gaze met Wang Tianxiang and Dong Sansi.

This look made the others terrified. They felt Luo Tian's eyes had a pulling force, drawing their gazes toward him, captivating and soul-stirring.

Luo Tian released the pressure on them. He let out a low laugh, "I've reached the Mind Sea Peak! These two's souls are truly nourishing. They boosted my spiritual sense from the Mind Sea Mid-stage to the Mind Sea Peak!"

"Luo Tian! You!" Dong Sansi asked, confused. He didn't know why Luo Tian's gaze had been so terrifying.

"Nothing's wrong. My spiritual sense has just increased!" Luo Tian patted Dong Sansi's shoulder to reassure him.

Hearing that Luo Tian's spiritual sense had increased again, Dong Sansi was shocked. He knew that when they were in the Alchemy Hall, Luo Tian's spiritual sense had already been at the Mind Sea Mid-stage. It was far ahead of his peers. Now it had increased again, meaning at least the Mind Sea Peak.

He thought about some of the Alchemy Hall's Bone-Devouring Stage elders. Few could reach the Mind Sea Peak! Dong Sansi was even more shocked.

Ignoring Dong Sansi's shock, Luo Tian continued to look at the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. He placed his hands on its surface, trying to lift it. But even with his Body-Refining Stage Nine strength and Five Elements Body, he couldn't move it an inch. He looked at the others.

Others saw Luo Tian couldn't lift it and shook their heads.

Finally, they tried to lift it together but still didn't move an inch. They all sat down无力 (helplessly).

Luo Tian's eyes showed strong frustration. He knew this cauldron was definitely a treasure, but he couldn't do anything about it. When would he be able to lift it? If someone else took it, wouldn't he cry?

Finally, there was no choice but to try using his master's storage ring.

"Buzz..." A heavy hum echoed. The massive Soul-Subduing Cauldron instantly disappeared before their eyes.

"Boom..." The heavy cauldron fell into the storage ring's space.

The Rending Sky Spear seemed to sense it, emitting a series of humming sounds. Its consciousness showed vigilance.

Luo Tian was relieved to finally be able to take it and took a deep breath. He looked at Dong Sansi and others, but he noticed they were all staring hungrily at the surrounding weapons.

After breaking the array and the spiritual sense冲击 (impact) disappeared, they began to examine these weapons. They were surprised to find them all were High-Grade Yellow-ranked weapons.

Chapter 145: Yuan Ling Vein

Chapter 145: Yuan Ling Vein

Seeing their hungry gazes, Luo Tian smiled lightly. "Pick whatever you like! Don't worry about me!"

Luo Tian's words had barely finished when Wang Tianxiang rushed out first, holding a large hammer he couldn't put down.

Others also rushed toward other weapons. Although Luo Tian had taken the cauldron, for them it was like being a bystander. Getting High-Grade Yellow-ranked weapons was already satisfying.

They had self-awareness, each picking one they liked and returning to Luo Tian's side.

Luo Tian said nothing. He waved his hand, not looking at the remaining weapons and collected them into his storage ring.

They scoured the third floor again but found nothing. They descended to the second floor.

When they reached the second floor, they witnessed an unforgettable scene. Luo Tian patted his forehead and smiled bitterly: "I forgot about these people!"

At this moment, Lan Yichen and others were in a pitiful state. It was bad enough, but what made them unforgettable was that their tents were all raised high, with smiles on their faces. Those who hadn't set up tents had a puddle-like substance there.

Dong Sansi and Wang Tianxiang were stunned. They knew what had happened to Lan Yichen and others, so they looked at Luo Tian with strange expressions.

Luo Tian saw them looking at him and felt embarrassed. He cursed Gu Lei for giving him such a poison!

He quickly took out the antidote pills Gu Lei had given him and handed them to Wang Tianxiang, asking him to give them to Lan Yichen and others.

After Lan Yichen and others took the pills, Luo Tian's group quickly left the tree hole. They could imagine the awkwardness Lan Yichen and others would feel when they woke up.

...

Just as Luo Tian's group had barely left the tree hole, a bright light screen appeared again in the depths of Great An Forest. It seemed to attract people's attention, although it was much weaker than before. Still, it made everyone's eyes brighten with excitement as the dense spiritual energy radiated again, making those in Great An Forest feel refreshed.

"Finally appeared! This is the real treasure!" He said, "Let's go!"

People moved around. Dozens of people still wandering in Great An Forest noticed the light screen and rushed toward it.

"Hmph! I'll take this treasure!" Wang Siyuan of the Xuan Yin Sect defeated a Yellow-ranked High-Grade beast, panting as he looked at the light screen. His figure vanished from his spot.

"Training is over! It's time to meet the other sects!" Lei Zong's disciple, his figure flashed and became a lightning bolt, vanishing from the spot. The beast he had confronted missed its attack.

At the same time, disciples of the remaining three first-tier sects also showed strong fighting spirit and rushed toward the light screen.

But Luo Tian's group was now confused. The bright light was less than a hundred li away from them.

They all showed joy on their faces and rushed toward the light's source.

In just a minute, they reached the location of the light.

A pile of stones in various shapes radiated spiritual energy and lay quietly on the ground. The light from the stones converged together.

"Is this a spiritual energy stone?" Luo Tian asked, picking up one of the stones on the ground.

"How many spiritual energy stones!" Wang Tianxiang's eyes were filled with stars, looking at the pile of spiritual energy stones.

"No, there's a Yuan Ling Vein here!" A disciple from the Five Elements Sect said with a trembling voice.

"Yuan Ling Vein!" These four words struck the hearts of Luo Tian and others.

Spiritual energy stones were common currency on the continent. Although spiritual energy stones were precious, they weren't very attractive to Luo Tian, an alchemist. The pile of spiritual energy stones was already a terrifying number, but it wasn't as shocking as the Yuan Ling Vein.

Yuan Ling Veins were rare on Tianyuan Continent. Sects often built their bases over Yuan Ling Veins because of the dense spiritual energy, making their sect's spiritual energy much more concentrated than other areas.

For example, Feiyun Sect, a second-tier sect, had a medium-grade Yuan Ling Vein under its mountain. The Five Elements Sect's mountain also had a top-grade Yuan Ling Vein. A sect with a Yuan Ling Vein was truly a sect.

But now, there was a Yuan Ling Vein under their feet. How could they not be excited? Whoever obtained it would become incredibly wealthy and have an extremely fast cultivation speed.

"Quickly collect the spiritual energy stones. Soon someone will come, so we need to act fast!" Luo Tian's urgent voice echoed.

After the voice finished, the others started acting. They put piles of spiritual energy stones into their storage bags. Luo Tian also waved his hand, collecting large batches of spiritual energy stones into his storage ring, much faster than the others.

"Damn! Someone got here first. Whoever took my things, I'll make you spit it out!" Wang Siyuan felt the light screen slightly dimmed. He sneered and increased his speed.

Meanwhile, those rushing toward this place also sensed the light screen's changes. They gritted their teeth and rushed toward it.

Luo Tian's spiritual sense was constantly extended outward. His spiritual sense had reached the Mind Sea Peak, allowing him to detect up to several thousand zhang. When he felt someone's figure appear in his spiritual sense, he shouted: "Stop!"

"Dig it out!" Luo Tian ignored the others' confusion and continued to issue orders.

Luo Tian was the first to act. He took out a Yellow-ranked High-Grade short sword from his storage ring and dug into the ground. His spiritual sense felt that this was where the spiritual energy was most concentrated.

Others, trusting Luo Tian blindly, didn't hesitate and took out weapons they had obtained from the tree hole. They followed Luo Tian's digging.

Not long after, a large hole appeared under their feet as they dug deeper and deeper into the ground.

"One thousand zhang... two thousand zhang!" As time passed, their depth increased.

"Boom..." Wang Siyuan's figure appeared at the place where Luo Tian and others had been. He looked at the ground full of spiritual energy stones, his face filled with confusion. Then his expression changed.

"Whoosh..." A wind sound echoed. Other disciples from the first-tier sects arrived one after another, looking at the ground full of spiritual energy stones. Their faces showed shock.
