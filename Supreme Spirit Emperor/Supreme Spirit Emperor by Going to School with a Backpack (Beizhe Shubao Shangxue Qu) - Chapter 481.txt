“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog seemed to have realized something, its eyes filled with fear yet tinged with excitement. It scattered its legs and flew wildly, seeking a secluded spot.

Time passed in agonizing increments. Luo Tian sat cross-legged atop the Three-Headed Dog, his wounds beginning to mend with serene composure. He continuously communicated with the Book of Epochs, preparing a decisive strike against Yao Tiancheng.

“Hahahaha… You think you can run?” After a quarter of an hour, Yao Tiancheng sneered, closing in within a hundred paces.

Chapter 1859: The Bird in the Bush

“Kid, you can’t escape. I didn’t expect your side to have such a ferocious beast—apparently, a True Beast!” Yao Tiancheng caught up with Luo Tian, his face alight with ecstatic triumph.

“Die!” Mid-flight, Yao Tiancheng formed a hand seal with one hand and pointed his finger. A dense aura of divine energy coalesced into a golden arrow, hurtling toward Luo Tian.

An overwhelming sense of peril made Luo Tian tremble, yet his eyes held a mocking glint. Golden light radiated from his body, illuminating the sky. Luo Tian stood like a celestial deity atop the Three-Headed Dog, his gaze locking onto Yao Tiancheng.

For some reason, Yao Tiancheng’s disdainful look ignited a foreboding sense within him.

“Could he still have another trick up his sleeve?” Yao Tiancheng’s heart quivered. The previous display of Luo Tian summoning the King of Ghosts and four half-True Immortal ghosts had left him awestruck.

Indeed, without Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi’s aid, today’s outcome might have been different. Facing Luo Tian alone would have meant certain death.

“Impossible! If he had another trick, why flee? Is this a ruse?” Yao Tiancheng considered turning back, knowing that suspicion of danger demanded immediate retreat.

“Buzz…” Yet Luo Tian refused to grant Yao Tiancheng an escape. He commanded the Three-Headed Dog, which abruptly reversed course and flew toward Yao Tiancheng.

The Book of Epochs emerged from Luo Tian’s mind, its golden radiance engulfing the sky as if night had been transformed into day. Luo Tian’s face bore a sickly pallor; the Book of Epochs drained his spirit and divine energy at an alarming rate. He knew that after using it, he would be weakened for days.

Luo Tian had no desire to unleash the Book of Epochs. He understood its significance; even in the Immortal Realm, many would covet it. This was why he hesitated to use it.

Yet now, with no other options, the Book of Epochs was his only ace. To eliminate Yao Tiancheng and escape, he had no choice but to deploy it.

The golden book slowly opened. Even a single page sent Yao Tiancheng reeling, paralyzed by an immense pressure that made his spirit tremble. Though a half-True Immortal, Yao Tiancheng felt an insurmountable helplessness.

“What is this thing!” Yao Tiancheng’s mouth opened, but the Book of Epochs’ overwhelming pressure stifled his voice. He could only scream mentally.

“Golden Scripture! Shatter the Heavens!” Luo Tian spoke softly. As his words fell, golden radiance surged from the Book of Epochs, spreading outward.

Like before at the Tremendous Immortal Sect, where the golden light touched, everything was annihilated. It instantly enveloped Yao Tiancheng.

“Ah…” Yao Tiancheng’s fear deepened, his furious roars echoing. His eyes flashed terror as he struggled to break free from the Book of Epochs’ oppression. He watched the void consume him, desperately burning his blood.

But Yao Tiancheng’s eyes soon turned desperate. A formless hand seized him, rendering escape impossible. He could only watch his body and spirit be obliterated by the annihilating light.

“Recall…” Luo Tian’s face paled, collapsing onto the Three-Headed Dog. He swiftly收回 the Book of Epochs and urged the beast to flee.

Despite defeating Yao Tiancheng, an ominous premonition gnawed at Luo Tian’s mind—feeling watched.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog’s eyes flashed fear. It glanced at the desolate earth before turning and flying away.

“Rustle…” Sitting atop the Three-Headed Dog, Luo Tian wasted no time, swallowing handfuls of pills into his mouth.

“Buzz…” As if a torrential rain had fallen upon parched earth, Luo Tian eagerly absorbed the pills’ essence.

He didn’t care about the chaos at Luan Tian Mountain. A True Immortal’s initial-stage King of Ghosts and four half-True Immortals would certainly overwhelm Luan Tian Sect.

Yet Luo Tian felt a pang of regret. He had exhausted all his secrets to eliminate Yao Tiancheng. He didn’t know if those four ghosts would return, but he had no regrets. Chen Zhanbiao and Long Jie were saved; Luo Tian would sacrifice anything—his Book of Epochs, even his life—to ensure their safety.

With the pills’ restoration, Luo Tian’s complexion regained some vitality. He sat cross-legged on the Three-Headed Dog’s massive body, observing the changing scenery.

Yet his unease lingered. The feeling of being watched persisted; he dared not slow the Three-Headed Dog’s pace.

After an hour of flight, Luo Tian’s brows furrowed deeper. He replayed his experiences at Luan Tian Sect, pondering who might have followed him.

“Guan Hongseng!” As he mused, Luo Tian recalled one person—Luan Tian Sect’s Grandmaster, Guan Hongseng.

Since Yao Tiancheng, Fan Tianming, and Mei Gueqi emerged, Guan Hongseng had vanished. Luo Tian hadn’t time to focus on him.

But now, he remembered: Guan Hongseng was a Celestial Immortal nearing the half-True Immortal stage. He recalled Guan Hongseng’s gaze—greedy, like a predator.

“It must be him. But why hasn’t he appeared? Is it out of fear of my earlier annihilation of Yao Tiancheng?” Luo Tian mused.

“Why did he help me before?” Luo Tian’s mind churned, analyzing Guan Hongseng’s past actions—unusual and inexplicable.

These doubts bred vigilance. In the treacherous Immortal Realm, Luo Tian trusted no one but his allies from the Nine Realms.

Yet despite his vigilance, Luo Tian’s demeanor bore a smile. His aura returned to its peak, and he stood calmly atop the Three-Headed Dog, directing it toward Tianlong Sect.

In truth, Luo Tian didn’t wish to return to Tianlong Sect. Originally, he planned to recover after defeating Yao Tiancheng and then ambush Duan Chengfeng upon his return. After all, Chen Zhanbiao was still with him—only Duan Chengfeng and Luan Tian Sect knew this. If he eliminated Duan Chengfeng, no one else would know. Luo Tian was certain that Luan Tian Sect would be in chaos for a while, or at least dare not provoke Tianlong Sect.

But now, it was likely he had been followed by a Celestial Immortal. Luo Tian had no choice but to return.

“Jewel Forge!” He then recalled another destination—the Jewel Forge, which even Luan Tian Sect dared not provoke. Its backer must be a formidable force or entity that Luan Tian Sect feared.

Yet Luo Tian dismissed the thought. The Jewel Forge was a good place, but he trusted Tianlong Sect more—after all, it had Zuo Qiuming and Xue Changshan.

“How can I shake this tail?” He pondered, knowing his current strength was no match for the opponent. Luo Tian knew that soon, the adversary would test him—his most dangerous moment.

As he mused, a surge of energy rose behind him. A black figure emerged from the night’s shadows, obscured by dark mist, blocking the Three-Headed Dog’s path.

“Damn! So soon!” Luo Tian felt his scalp tingle. This faceless figure sent chills down his spine.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog halted, its six silver eyes glaring at the shadow with a low growl of warning.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian spoke softly, standing atop the Three-Headed Dog. His heart drummed; his greatest secret was whether the opponent knew he could still activate the Book of Epochs. He knew this shadow had witnessed his annihilation of Yao Tiancheng.

Additionally, Luo Tian was puzzled. The figure’s aura differed entirely from Guan Hongseng’s. Though Guan Hongseng had given him a cold feeling, this shadow’s aura was utterly different—evil, saturated with souls.

Even with his formidable spirit, Luo Tian couldn’t pierce the shadow’s obscured form or discern its cultivation. That alone was enough to make him wary.

“I am who I am; what matters is I’ve come to deliver you a boon!” The shadow chuckled, its hands moving swiftly. Luo Tian sensed the opponent’s greedy gaze.

“What to do?” Luo Tian watched the shadow’s power intensify, cold sweat beading on his brow. Yet he bit his lip and channeled the little divine energy he had recovered into the Book of Epochs. Golden light radiated from his body, mirroring his earlier annihilation of Yao Tiancheng.

“Buzz…” The Book of Epochs slowly emerged from Luo Tian’s head, hovering there with an invisible pressure.

“Hmph… If I’m not mistaken, you can only use this broken book once!” The shadow’s voice carried disdain. Its movements didn’t slow, as black script dragons flew from its hands.

“You dare try!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness, but his heart drummed. The golden Book of Epochs radiated more divine light, its aura rising steadily.

Chapter 1860: At the Mercy of Another

Seeing Luo Tian’s aura rise and the golden book gleam, the shadow paused slightly.

“I’ll test your golden scripture!” A crazed voice echoed through the sky. The shadow’s finger pointed, sending a cold black script dragon hurtling toward Luo Tian.

“Done!” Luo Tian’s body shuddered. The Book of Epochs dimmed, then returned to his mind.

“Hahahaha… Correct! How could you kill a half-True Immortal with only a Celestial Immortal’s strength without cost!”

“Even an extreme realm cannot fight across ranks so recklessly!” The shadow’s laughter echoed, filled with joy. Luo Tian heard the glee in its voice.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog roared, spitting out its moon-like core to clash with the black script dragon.

“An impressive beast. Let’s subdue it together!” The shadow sneered, though the Three-Headed Dog was no match for it.

“Buzz…” Three script dragons split from five, entwining the core. Complex scripts moved, emitting an unusual aura.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog’s six eyes flashed fear. It tried to inhale the core back into its body.

“Don’t think it’s easy!” A mocking voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, but he detected its coldness—no emotion.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog grew frantic. Its core was its entire cultivation and strongest attack; without it, the beast’s strength would plummet.

Luo Tian was equally desperate but powerless. He was worse off than the Three-Headed Dog.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog roared wildly, but it was helpless. The gap in strength was insurmountable.

“Buzz…” Meanwhile, five black script dragons wrapped around Luo Tian, making his face grimace.

“Break free!” Luo Tian roared, trying to use his physical strength to repel the dragons. Yet they ignored him and entered his body.

“Damn…” Cold sweat drenched Luo Tian’s face. He felt an icy, invasive presence in his body, rushing to his dantian and entwining the golden-black divine elixir.

“Buzz…” Black script dragons coiled around the elixir, like an invisible chain. A strange sensation flooded Luo Tian’s mind.

“This elixir no longer belongs to me!” Luo Tian shouted, staring at the shadow obscured by mist.

Meanwhile, the Three-Headed Dog’s core returned to its body. Its silver eyes mirrored Luo Tian’s fear.

“Hahahaha… Completed!” The mist dissipated, revealing a face Luo Tian recognized—deep-set eyes glowing red. It was Guan Hongseng, Luan Tian Sect’s Grandmaster.

“Impossible!” Luo Tian’s face turned pale. Since Guan Hongseng had revealed his true form, he no longer feared Luo Tian.

“Kid, cultivate properly. If you don’t want your cultivation lost, obey me from now on!” Guan Hongseng smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Humiliation!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, feeling endless humiliation. This sensation hadn’t gripped him in ages.

“Subjugated!” At this moment, Luo Tian knew that one thought from Guan Hongseng would erase his years of cultivation.

“Hand over your golden scripture! Give it to me!” Guan Hongseng loomed, his life now in his hands. Yet he wouldn’t kill Luo Tian immediately; he needed him strong enough to later reclaim his cultivation, which would elevate his power to terrifying heights.

Luo Tian tightly gripped his fists, gazing at Guan Hongseng. He gritted his teeth in忍耐; the Book of Epochs was his greatest secret, and he had a bond with it. From initial hatred to its role in shaping his life, it was irreplaceable.

“I told you to hand it over. Didn’t you hear?” Guan Hongseng glared at Luo Tian, treating him like a slave.

“Buzz…” As Guan Hongseng’s command echoed, the black script dragons around his dantian stirred. A devouring force radiated from them, siphoning Luo Tian’s already depleted divine elixir.

“Fine…” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, nodding heavily. His forehead veins bulged, but he had no choice.

“Buzz…” With his last divine energy, Luo Tian released the Book of Epochs. The golden scripture hovered above his head.

“Hahahaha…” Guan Hongseng’s eyes gleamed with fervor. He reached out, grasping the Book of Epochs.

“I’ll reclaim it!” Luo Tian’s mind roared. His gaze locked onto the Book of Epochs in Guan Hongseng’s grasp.

“Mantis catches cicada, the oriole waits behind. Calculated a thousand times, yet missed Guan Hongseng!” Luo Tian regretted deeply. If he had delayed using the Book of Epochs, Guan Hongseng would have been annihilated too.

Yet Luo Tian had left a card—keeping one page of the Book of Epochs for future retrieval. He wasn’t certain if Guan Hongseng would stay in Luan Tian Sect, but he knew Guan Hongseng would eventually find him. That was when his cultivation would be harvested.

“Originally, he wanted to strike me!” Luo Tian now understood why Guan Hongseng had helped him.

At this moment, a seed was planted in Luo Tian’s body—its growth would feed on his cultivation. When it matured, Guan Hongseng would come to reap it.

“Terrifying technique!” Luo Tian muttered, watching Guan Hongseng holding the Book of Epochs. He wondered where Guan Hongseng had learned it.

Luo Tian didn’t fear Guan Hongseng deciphering the Book of Epochs. After all, he had been its master for years without understanding it. Moreover, Luo Tian could sense that he was still the Book of Epochs’ master.

His concern was the Book of Epochs’ exposure. He knew it wasn’t simple; if discovered, it would surely involve him.

“From now on, I won’t repeat myself!” Guan Hongseng coldly spoke. He then frowned slightly and stored the Book of Epochs, addressing Luo Tian.

“What is this golden scripture? How did you activate it?” Guan Hongseng frowned, sensing its complexity immediately.

“Stay in Tianlong Sect. I’ll contact you if needed!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, darkening his face.

“Remember, when you see me, kneel!” Without waiting for a response, Guan Hongseng added, darkening Luo Tian’s face further.

“I know. You’re不服, with so many tricks—killing Yao Tiancheng and even a True Immortal’s initial-stage King of Ghosts. But now I am your master. Everything you have will belong to me. Understood?”

“Now, kneel and speak! Did you hear?” Guan Hongseng spoke loudly, his eyes filled with strange pleasure and coldness.

Luo Tian tightly gripped his fists. His heart was at its limit of humiliation. He clenched his fists, but he didn’t kneel. He knew that if he did, his Dao heart would shatter.

“Hmph!” Guan Hongseng’s face turned unpleased. Yet he frowned slightly and took flight, heading into the distance.

“This was your first time. Next time, if you don’t kneel, I’ll make it worse!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Ah… Guan Hongseng, I’ll make you wish for death!” Luo Tian roared mentally, his eyes flashing madness.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog howled into the sky, its voice filled with anger. Its core also bore three black script dragons.

“Luo Tian…” As Luo Tian raged, two figures soared through the air toward him and the Three-Headed Dog.

Feeling their arrival, Luo Tian’s face bore a bitter smile. The two were an old man and a middle-aged man—Zuo Qiuming and Xue Changshan.

“Big Brother…” Luo Tian adjusted his state, regaining composure. He spoke softly, gazing at Xue Changshan with respect.

“Why so battered? Did Luan Tian Sect’s bastards bully you?” Zuo Qiuming saw Luo Tian’s state and frowned.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded. He shifted the topic, addressing Zuo Qiuming: “Big Brother, why did you come? And brought Master Xue too?”

“Long Jie was delivered to Tianlong Sect. Then this girl found me, told me about your conflict with Luan Tian Sect. I worried for your safety and brought Father here!” Zuo Qiuming helped Luo Tian, who was weak, with concern.

“Big Brother’s kindness!” Luo Tian felt warmth. He was grateful for their arrival, which solved some problems. He knew if he hadn’t knelt, Guan Hongseng might have killed him.

Chapter 1861: Return to Tianlong

“Brother, where are the others?”

“Did they trouble you?” Zuo Qiuming glanced at the Three-Headed Dog before addressing Luo Tian, his voice filled with concern.

“They came to trouble me at Luan Tian Sect. But I escaped!” Luo Tian mused, recalling a scheme—a frame-up.

“The Three-Headed Dog is yours?”薛长山, who hadn’t spoken yet, narrowed his eyes. He noticed the Three-Headed Dog’s uniqueness.

“Hmph, it’s my brother!” Luo Tian spoke softly. In the Immortal Realm, others saw beasts as animals, but Luo Tian didn’t.

He also felt a pang of guilt. The Three-Headed Dog had always given, never received. It was loyal and had suffered due to his involvement.

Luo Tian frowned slightly, exchanging glances with Xue Changshan. He saw a flicker of greed in Xue’s eyes.

Luo Tian clenched his fists. He knew Xue had coveted the Three-Headed Dog, though he masked it well. Yet Luo Tian detected it.

“Is he waiting for me to give him the Three-Headed Dog?” The thought struck Luo Tian.

In Tianlong Sect, his greatest reliance was Xue Changshan. Now he regretted revealing all his secrets to him.

Xue Changshan had always helped him, but Luo Tian knew it was because he could aid Zuo Qiuming. Essentially, Xue saw him as a promising talent.

“Blackie, return!” Luo Tian waved his hand. The Three-Headed Dog growled and returned to his wrist ring.

Seeing this, Xue Changshan frowned slightly but said nothing. An awkward atmosphere formed between Luo Tian and Xue.

“Let’s go back to the Sect!” Xue Changshan spoke softly, as if unconcerned. Yet Luo Tian knew a rift had formed between them.

“Too naive!” Luo Tian took flight, assisted by Zuo Qiuming. He sighed inwardly.

When he first entered the Immortal Realm, he had a bit of pride. His talent and nature were exceptional; his greatest reliance was longevity. Yet he hadn’t expected this arrogance to cost him dearly—trusting Xue Changshan.

Yet he didn’t blame Xue. Fundamentally, Xue had helped him multiple times.

But Xue wanted the Three-Headed Dog. Luo Tian would never agree. In the Immortal Realm, he had learned its harshness and treachery—interests over everything.

“From now on, be cautious!” Luo Tian muttered. His mind cleared. From today, he wouldn’t underestimate anyone. He returned to the mindset of his days in the Nine Realms—careful and calculating.

“From now on, I’ll scheme others. No one will scheme me!” Luo Tian roared mentally. This massive loss had been a warning: this was the Immortal Realm, not the Nine Realms. He was just one among many.

Xue Changshan and Zuo Qiuming were strong. Luo Tian sensed Zuo Qiuming had reached the Celestial Immortal’s peak, obviously having helped Zuo Qiuming improve during his absence.

Throughout the journey, Xue Changshan said nothing. Zuo Qiuming constantly inquired about Luo Tian’s condition.

“Later at Luan Tian Mountain, the beasts and ghosts rebelled. That’s why I escaped! As for Duan Elder and Zhu Fenghuo, I don’t know their status!” Luo Tian feigned ignorance.

“Brother, this trip has been hard. I’ll deal with Duan Chengfeng eventually!” Zuo Qiuming spoke confidently.

“Thanks, Big Brother!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed gratitude. He felt Zuo Qiuming cared for him.

Yet, he was cautious. Though Zuo Qiuming genuinely cared, if forced to choose between him and Xue Changshan, even a fool would know Zuo Qiuming’s choice.

After three days of flight, Luo Tian’s strength recovered slightly. Though he didn’t want to return to Tianlong Sect, Sun Kelian and Yu Changtian were still there.

After seven more days of flight, Luo Tian and the two reached Tianlong Sect. Ten days later, his strength fully recovered—giving him some confidence. Yet he knew this was nothing against Xue Changshan’s True Immortal strength.

“Can I annihilate a True Immortal with this page of the Book of Epochs?” Luo Tian mused. His greatest secret was a single page in his mind. The King of Ghosts and four Celestial Immortal-level ghosts might still return.

Xue Changshan led Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming to the main peak, entering a grand hall.

“You can rest here. Once Duan Chengfeng returns, you can complete your mission!” Xue Changshan spoke, his tone flat.

“Thank you, Master. How are my two friends?” Luo Tian asked directly, inquiring about Sun Kelian and Yu Changtian.

“Fine. Though they were imprisoned, they weren’t harmed!” Xue Changshan’s head veins twitched at Luo Tian’s words. He recalled the fat man’s chaos at the main peak.

“How long until they’re sent to the Middle Three Heavens? What are the conditions for their escort?” Luo Tian asked again.

“Top three disciples of the Tianlong Rankings, plus three elders and one Supreme Elder!” Xue Changshan answered truthfully. He knew Luo Tian’s intent, but this lineup was enough to dominate the Lower Three Heavens.

“Thank you for your care, Master. I won’t trouble you further!” Luo Tian bowed slightly and exited the main peak.

Watching him leave, Xue Changshan frowned. He noticed Luo Tian’s change. He knew Luo Tian lied; he didn’t believe Luo Tian could escape Luan Tian Sect so easily. He knew Luan Tian Sect’s strength—himself wouldn’t have escaped.

“This kid needs to be watched!” Xue Changshan told Zuo Qiuming, causing his face to shift slightly. His eyes showed confusion.

“I sense he has resentment toward me!” Xue Changshan’s face bore coldness. Luo Tian was right; he did want the Three-Headed Dog and waited for him to give it. But Luo Tian didn’t.

“You may go back. If possible, recruit Long Youran to your side. He might be useful later!” Xue Changshan spoke again, then fell silent.

“Okay…” Zuo Qiuming nodded. Clearly, he chose Xue Changshan’s side over Luo Tian’s.

Luo Tian walked through the land, pondering his next move. No matter what, he had to save Sun Kelian and Yu Changtian.

“My time is short. If Duan Chengfeng returns, it might cause trouble. After all, I killed Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe!” Luo Tian muttered.

Unconsciously, he reached the outer sect. It was lively as usual. His return went unnoticed; everyone assumed he’d perished.

He soon reached Zhu Youde’s place, gently knocking on the door. His eyes held a smile.

“Who is it?” A lazy voice echoed inside. Zhu Youde waddled out, his oily face revealing himself. He saw Luo Tian’s smile.

“You…” Zhu Youde was stunned, pointing an oily finger at Luo Tian. His eyes held disbelief.

“Luo Senior returned!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his tone playful. He could guess Zhu Youde’s feelings.

Zhu Youde’s eyes flashed with light, then chuckled nervously to mask his embarrassment. Luo Tian’s sudden return had shocked him.

“Luo Junior returned. This mission had some issues. I came to inform you, Master Zhu!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“What issue?” Zhu Youde’s face changed. Luo Tian had left with Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe. Now, Luo Tian returned alone without them—this alarmed him.

“Nothing major. Luan Tian Sect had some unexpected issues. Master Zhu and Ruan Xinghe might have met misfortune!”

“Luan Tian Sect didn’t want to hand over the Ascension candidate, wanting to kill us. Master Zhu and Ruan Xinghe fought desperately to send me out!” Luo Tian glared, lying.

“Haha… Luo Junior returned safely. Rest well. I’ll report to the Grandmaster!” Zhu Youde was momentarily flustered, especially seeing Luo Tian’s gaze. He felt a chill.

“Then thank you, Master Zhu!” Luo Tian smiled playfully. He knew Zhu Youde was now in a panic. Though he didn’t believe Luo Tian’s words, with only himself returning, it was his story to tell—this was his advantage.

Luo Tian bid farewell to Zhu Youde, heading toward the Tianlong Cemetery. Only there did he feel a sliver of safety. Though the King of Ghosts and four half-True Immortals were gone, countless ghosts remained—his only asset. Though this was nothing to Tianlong Sect, it would certainly stir chaos.

Chapter 1862: Seeking Xuan Dan

Luo Tian walked for an hour, reaching the Tianlong Cemetery’s entrance. He felt its eerie atmosphere and smiled.

He gently opened the hut’s door. Dust filled the room, indicating no one had replaced him during his absence.

“Strength… if I were a Celestial King, who could oppose me!” Luo Tian muttered. He still resented the heavy loss from this trip.

“Brother…” The Nourishing Dragon Seal radiated divine light. Long Jie’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“How are you?” Hearing Long Jie, Luo Tian’s face softened. The rescue of Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao was worth it.

“I’ve recovered, but I can’t appear. The Immortal Realm’s rules seem to forbid beasts from transforming into humans. If I emerged, it might cause trouble.” Long Jie transmitted mentally.

“That’s good. You suffered; this debt will be repaid!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cruelty. He knew the true threat wasn’t Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi, but Guan Hongseng.

Though he didn’t know how many people Guan Hongseng had placed under his restriction, it was certainly many. Though Guan Hongseng was a Celestial Immortal’s peak, if he took everyone’s cultivation, his power would reach terrifying heights.

“Hmph… I’ve also been restricted. Zhanbiao was too!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Long Jie’s voice carried icy hatred.

“Creak…” Luo Tian clenched his fists tightly, trembling. Though prepared for Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao to be restricted, he still couldn’t accept it. His suppressed killing intent surged again.

“How did Zhanbiao end up like this?” Luo Tian asked again. He knew Long Jie might know what happened to Chen Zhanbiao.

“They’re bastards. They wanted to turn Zhanbiao into a weapon, injecting various beasts’ blood into his body. At first, it was fine; Zhanbiao’s strength increased!”

“But they were greedy. They injected a hundred types of blood, even taking one drop of my blood and injecting it into Zhanbiao. They couldn’t control him anymore, so they wanted to gift Zhanbiao to Tianlong Sect as a favor!” Long Jie’s voice was filled with killing intent.

Luo Tian’s eyes turned red. His bloodline issue had always been a taboo. He hadn’t expected Luan Tian Sect’s people to be so depraved.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and Chen Zhanbiao’s strong body appeared before him. His eyes were closed, as if asleep.

“How to heal?” Luo Tian was at a loss, his brows furrowed. The immediate priority was healing Chen Zhanbiao.

Luo Tian pondered, unsure how to proceed. He could sense Chen Zhanbiao’s energy was chaotic; if left too long, it would cause problems.

He wanted to try but feared issues. He knew any mistake would be catastrophic, yet the urgency of Chen Zhanbiao’s condition was pressing.

As Luo Tian mused, Chen Zhanbiao suddenly opened his eyes. Blood-red light flashed from them. His two fangs slowly emerged.

“Grrr…” Chen Zhanbiao roared, his wounds long healed. He struggled violently, his strong arms pounding the ground with thunderous sound.
