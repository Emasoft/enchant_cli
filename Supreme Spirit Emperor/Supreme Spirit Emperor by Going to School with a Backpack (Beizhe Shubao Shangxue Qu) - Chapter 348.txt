Without Zheng Xin's reminder, Luo Tian and others moved swiftly to surround the youth. Even Luo Tian felt an overwhelming sense of danger from him, for he was a royal heir—far beyond the capabilities of any End-of-Era cultivator. His methods and spiritual energy were leagues ahead of those at the End-of-Era stage.

"Even if you are strong, to me, you're still an ant. I am the heir of the Ancient King's clan; my status is exalted. How could you mortals even compare? If it were back then, you wouldn't have had the right to lick my shoes!" The youth's face bore a cold expression as he was surrounded, showing no fear at all.

"Since I've emerged, the Ming Clan of the Ancient Kings will surely ascend to the Nine Realms and restore their former glory. This era, I am destined to become a king and follow in my father's footsteps into the Immortal Realm!" The youth murmured to himself.

"Die by my hand, and that is your honor. Remember, the one who killed you was a noble Ming Clan member—Ming Huan!" The youth's body radiated a thunderous sound as he moved swiftly toward Luo Tian.

"Kill!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei launched their martial arts techniques, which erupted into a terrifying torrent toward the youth.

"Dao of Sealing Demons!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination as he punched toward Ming Huan.

"Excellent," Ming Huan's eyes narrowed as he observed Zheng Xin's martial arts storm. He struck with a palm, then ignored the others and directly targeted Luo Tian.

A massive gray hand clashed against the storm of martial arts, producing a deafening sound.

The thunderous collision sent shockwaves through space. In the next moment, Ming Huan's body appeared like a phantom before Luo Tian, delivering a punch. He could sense that Luo Tian was the most formidable among them—intuitive instinct.

Their fists collided, sending a deafening roar and violent waves of energy outward. Luo Tian spat blood, his eyes filled with shock as his entire arm began to crack and he was thrown back a hundred feet.

Yet Ming Huan remained unscathed. He vanished again, appearing as an illusory figure before Luo Tian and delivering another punch.

"Fast!" Zheng Xin and Hu Tianzong's faces bore expressions of disbelief as they watched Ming Huan appear before Luo Tian in an instant, their eyes filled with awe.

Zheng Xin and Hu Tianzong were both speed specialists, but Ming Huan's speed felt even faster to Zheng Xin, leaving them shaken.

Even more astonishing was that Luo Tian, known for his invincible body, had been so thoroughly outmatched by Ming Huan. Though Ming Huan was at the End-of-Era stage, Luo Tian's body had always been legendary.

"Crack..." As the crowd marveled, Ming Huan delivered another punch to Luo Tian. Again a simple strike, but it sent Luo Tian back a hundred feet, his arm stained with blood.

"An heir of the royal clan is so strong. Is this the power of bloodline?" The crowd marveled, watching Luo Tian retreat and rushing toward Ming Huan.

"Chickens and dogs!" Ming Huan's face bore contempt as he let the others charge toward him, repeatedly striking.

Each punch seemed simple but left Zheng Xin and the others pale with each strike, their bodies retreating.

"You're not weak in human lands, are you? Few could withstand my two punches even among the End-of-Era in ancient times!" Ming Huan spoke softly, his voice carrying a hint of admiration for Luo Tian.

"This era seems interesting. It won't be boring!" Ming Huan moved swiftly, repelling the others and charging toward Luo Tian again.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly as Ming Huan approached. His hands moved swiftly, creating a golden vortex under the stars. The overwhelming pressure slowed Ming Huan's speed and forced him to stop, gazing at the golden vortex above.

"Your martial arts? A powerful one. If you were End-of-Era, I might have been wary. But alas!" Ming Huan sighed softly, his energy swirling as he let Luo Tian complete the Severing Heaven Seal.

The Reincarnation Immortal Body shattered, releasing a surge of energy into the golden vortex. The thunderous echo resonated as the massive vortex continuously absorbed heavenly power, forming a golden seal that descended upon Ming Huan.

"Truly strong. If I were Mid-Era, perhaps I would have been defeated!" Ming Huan's eyes gleamed with light, as if he found amusement in the situation. He pointed his finger at the descending seal.

The shadow of a Ming god appeared behind Ming Huan, adding an air of vitality to his eyes. His thick fingers pressed down on the seal.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed as the two collided, unleashing violent waves that annihilated vast stretches of space and stars. The area around them turned into a vacuum.

"Ten Thousand Divine Steps!" Luo Tian spoke softly, summoning the image of a divine beast behind him and stomping toward Ming Huan.

"Hmph. That's the aura of the wilderness!" Ming Huan's eyes flickered with surprise as he saw the divine beast image behind Luo Tian, his gaze sharp.

"Wild clan. Those fools! I never liked them! Brainless and brawn-heavy!" Ming Huan's hands formed seals, moving swiftly. His shadow followed him as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Two massive images collided, radiating the aura of an era. It was as if two giants were clashing in blood.

"Fight to the end!" Luo Tian's eyes burned with determination. For years, he hadn't felt such a surge of热血. Today, he had finally met an unparalleled enemy—ancient king's heir, whose strength surpassed his own.

"Killing a human genius is good exercise!" Ming Huan's eyes still held a smile as he clashed with Luo Tian again.

They exchanged blows, and Luo Tian unleashed all his techniques. Yet Ming Huan still dominated him. However, in his desperation, Luo Tian inflicted many wounds on Ming Huan, making the latter's form gradually look ragged.

"Feeling wounded!" Ming Huan sighed, licking his palm to remove the blood, as if stimulated. His hands moved swiftly, constantly shifting.

"Death Blade!" An invisible wave emerged from Ming Huan's hand, forming a gray long sword that instantly sliced Luo Tian. Yet Luo Tian's body showed no damage, passing through his flesh to strike directly at his soul.

"Go away!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. Though he might not match Ming Huan elsewhere, when it came to the soul, Luo Tian knew he was invincible!

A tangible soul surged forth and grasped the trajectory of the soul blade. He punched, and the powerful soul blade shattered instantly.

"Spit..." Ming Huan's face turned pale in an instant, his eyes filled with disbelief.

The Ming clan specialized in soul techniques, making their souls far stronger than other royal clans. As the heir of an ancient king, Ming Huan's soul was naturally formidable.

This technique that severed souls was one Ming Huan believed would leave anyone it struck either dead or severely wounded. Yet here, it was an unexpected failure.

"It's my turn!" Luo Tian's face turned pale, his entire body trembling. Though he had seemingly resisted Ming Huan's attack, it was extremely dangerous. Anyone at the Mid-Era stage would have been unable to withstand ten of Ming Huan's strikes, even someone like Xu Liyi or Zheng Xin.

Ming Huan was too strong. His every technique was beyond the ordinary, impossible for anyone to match.

But seeing Ming Huan attack with his soul, Luo Tian knew his chance had come. Due to the position of a Soul Sealer, Luo Tian's understanding of souls was far beyond Ming Huan's comprehension.

"Suppress!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. The shattered soul blade struggled in his soul, then transformed into gray threads that spread from his body toward Ming Huan.

"Damn it!" Ming Huan's face finally changed. He realized he had been careless. If it were just strength, even if Luo Tian was strong, he would have dominated him.

But by using the Soul Blade, Luo Tian seemed to understand it more deeply. Seeing those gray soul threads, Ming Huan knew that if he was struck by them, it would not end well.

"Buzz..." Ming Huan vanished from the spot in an instant, appearing ten thousand feet away.

"Where do you think it's that simple? These soul threads were originally yours! Take them back!" Luo Tian smiled, extending his hand. The gray soul threads seemed alive as they chased after Ming Huan. Five gray threads clung to his fingers.

"Pop..." No matter how Ming Huan tried to escape, the soul threads pierced into his body.

Chapter 1405: True Power

The gray soul threads instantly entered Ming Huan's body, causing his face to change abruptly. They then moved toward his soul and entered it.

"Boom..." At the same time, the soul threads in Luo Tian's hands vanished. However, his hands remained suspended in space, slowly exerting force.

"What? That's it?" Xu Liyi and others looked puzzled, watching the intact Ming Huan.

"That's nothing," Ming Huan sighed deeply in his heart. He stretched his body, a grimace on his face.

"You really know how to play tricks!" Ming Huan moved swiftly again, rushing toward Luo Tian with a cold gaze.

But Luo Tian seemed unaware and smiled, still standing in the same position. He watched Ming Huan approach.

"Luo Tian, run!" Zheng Xin and Hu Tianzong shouted, warning Luo Tian to escape. But Luo Tian seemed not to hear.

"Damn it! Did Ming Huan injure Luo Tian?" Zheng Xin and Hu Tianzong were extremely anxious, moving swiftly toward Luo Tian. Only their speed could save him.

"Stop!" But as soon as they moved, Luo Tian's voice echoed in their minds, causing them to pause.

"You two, what are you staring at? Go! Just the two of you are fast!" Xu Liyi finally became anxious, kicking Zheng Xin's back and sending him flying far away.

"Kid, no matter what tricks you play, they are useless against absolute strength!" Ming Huan watched Luo Tian's unmoving form and felt a strange irritation. He suddenly appeared before Luo Tian, his fist smashing down on Luo Tian's smiling face.

"Damn it!" Xu Liyi and others were truly desperate, shouting as they flew toward Luo Tian.

"It's too late!" Ming Huan sneered and ignored them, a cruel smile on his face as he imagined Luo Tian's head exploding.

But soon after, Ming Huan's expression changed wildly. His eyes were filled with disbelief as his fist was about to touch Luo Tian's head, and Luo Tian's hands slowly closed.

"Stop!" Luo Tian spoke softly. The sound was like a magic spell, echoing in Ming Huan's mind.

To Ming Huan's surprise, his body truly stopped. At that moment, he realized his change—his soul seemed to be pulled by an invisible force, like a marionette with no control.

"Jian Wu Ya!" A thunderous heavenly sword appeared in Luo Tian's other hand, suddenly appearing before Ming Huan and rushing toward his heart.

"Ah..." Ming Huan roared, his entire body trembling violently. His strong spiritual energy continuously clashed with his soul, and the gray soul also roared wildly, trying to break free.

"Pop..." The blue lightning pierced Ming Huan's body but did not pierce the heart. With his continuous effort, he finally regained some freedom of movement and shifted his body position.

"Ten Thousand Divine Steps!" Luo Tian's strongest attack, a black foot descended like a mountain and crushed Ming Huan's body.

Ming Huan was in terrible condition. Facing Luo Tian's strongest attack, he was directly crushed by the foot, and a crackling sound echoed from his body. His eyes showed weakness as he fell into the stars.

"Ah... you damned human slave!" Ming Huan roared, furious. His gaze turned to Luo Tian with madness. What was his identity? The heir of the ancient king, now trampled by a mere human. Ming Huan could not accept it.

But before Ming Huan could continue his harsh words, Luo Tian's figure appeared before him. His foot landed again on Ming Huan's pale face.

"Amazing!" Xu Liyi and others looked shocked, watching Luo Tian turn the situation around. They could not understand what technique he had used.

"Boom..." Zheng Xin's butt was kicked heavily by Xu Liyi, sending him flying far away.

"You motherf***er! You keep kicking me. I already knew Luo Tian could survive the crisis, so I didn't act. The techniques of our top-tier talents are beyond your comprehension!" Zheng Xin smiled, speaking to Xu Liyi.

"You motherf***er! You just keep pretending. You've surpassed Diaodezhu completely!" Xu Liyi felt a bit guilty and did not argue with Zheng Xin.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds kept echoing. Luo Tian's face was cold, and he continuously attacked, each strike causing Ming Huan to spit blood.

"From the moment you appeared, you had that arrogant and annoying attitude. The ancient king's clan is so great? I've not only killed your Ming clan, but also executed the royal heir. What can you do? What are you anyway, relying on your father!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, his foot constantly landing on Ming Huan's face.

Ming Huan was at his wit's end. What was his identity? The heir of the ancient king, now treated like a ball and trampled by a human.

Blood continuously spewed from Ming Huan's mouth, whether from anger or injury.

"Ah..." Ming Huan finally went mad and roared. His gray soul and strong spiritual energy began to burn fiercely, gradually breaking free from Luo Tian's control.

"Break..." As if something had shattered, Ming Huan instantly broke free from Luo Tian's control. His body flew backward, his eyes filled with madness and heavy breathing.

"You are Luo Tian, right? I will make your death very painful!" Ming Huan spoke coldly. He had never felt so embarrassed before. From the moment he appeared, he was severely wounded by Luo Tian, and Ming Huan's anger reached its peak.

"Now you don't have the right to say that!" Luo Tian smiled, his eyes filled with mockery. He looked at Ming Huan's many cracks and the blood hole near his heart, confident that Ming Huan was no longer his match.

"Ha! Do you think you've controlled me?" Ming Huan's eyes flashed with coldness, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Attack together and kill him!" Luo Tian did not want to waste time. He shouted at Xu Liyi and others, rushing toward Ming Huan. At this moment, Ming Huan's condition was at its worst and could not harm Xu Liyi and others much.

"Ha! The heir of the ancient king, but that's it!" Zheng Xin and others laughed, rushing toward Ming Huan with cold glares, determined to kill him together.

"Do you know why I am so revered? I am the heir of the Ming King and the only one besides my father who can fully control the Ming King's Palace!" Ming Huan ignored the group's attack, moving swiftly and creating countless afterimages. He suddenly appeared under the Ming King's Palace with a nostalgic look.

"I didn't want to use it, but there was no other choice. How many years has it been? The last time I used it, my father was still alive. Now only the two of us remain to accompany each other!" Ming Huan's eyes showed a sense of nostalgia. He extended his hand, and a drop of blood flew from his finger.

"Buzz..." After Ming Huan's blood touched the sinister Ming King's Palace, it radiated a powerful pressure. Ming Huan stood under the palace with his black hair飞扬, hands forming seals and eyes filled with cruelty as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Feel honored. In your lifetime, you will witness the true power of an era!" Ming Huan spoke coldly, continuing to form seals and imprinting them on the Ming King's Palace.

The thunderous sound echoed. The sinister feeling made Luo Tian and others feel a chill, even under the protection of the Yin-Yang Twin Fish.

"Two old men, can you withstand it?" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei asked the people on the ship, looking at the Yin-Yang Twin Fish.

"Relax. As long as you recite the incantation, we can do anything..." The soul of the Yin-Yang Twin Fish emerged from the tortoise shell, scoffing at them. However, the two quickly retreated.

"What the hell is this? How could it be fully controlled!"

"Believe in the Yin-Yang elders and live forever... Yin-Yang Immortal... infinite power... unity of Yin and Yang... invincible!" Before the Yin-Yang Twin Fish could speak, people on the ship behind Luo Tian also felt the terror of the Ming King's Palace and shouted loudly, hoping the Yin-Yang Twin Fish would display its power as before.

"Don't shout. Brothers, we were wrong. We can't withstand it unless we find the Divine and Demon Path Map and combine our efforts!" The Yin-Yang Twin Fish looked at the overwhelming Ming King's Palace, nearly crying as they spoke to Luo Tian and others.

"Unreliable things. How about you two also hold on for me!" Luo Tian shouted at them, the Reincarnation Immortal Body raging and pouring era power into the Yin Fish.

Sun Kelnian did the same, knowing it was a matter of life and death. He immediately poured all his era power into the Yin-Yang Twin Fish.

"Hope the Ancient Heaven Palace is here!" Luo Tian sighed longingly. He was now at Mid-Era, the true master of the Ancient Heaven Palace. If he went all out, he could also fully unleash the power of the Ancient Heaven Palace.

But now, they had no choice but to trust the Yin-Yang Twin Fish. If even the twin fish couldn't withstand it, they probably had no chance of salvation.

Chapter 1406: Passing By

"Let's take a risk!" The Yin-Yang Twin Fish clearly felt the great danger and did not want Luo Tian's group to be harmed. They exchanged a glance and rushed back into the tortoise shell.

"Unity of Yin and Yang, invincible!" A wave of shouts echoed under the void. The Yin-Yang Twin Fish merged again in the anxious eyes of the people.

"Smash!" Ming Huan roared, extending his hand to push Luo Tian's group fiercely.

"Buzz..." The gray palace expanded dramatically with the nine-nine long dragons circling it. An overwhelming aura spread from the cold palace, a chilling chill that made Luo Tian's group shiver as if everything would be frozen.

Even the battle between Xuanbing Old Ancestor and Mingzhenyan was affected. That terrifying pressure made even those at the peak of an era feel overwhelmed.

Xuanbing Old Ancestor flew in front of Luo Tian's group, his face showing a serious expression as he gazed at the Ming King's Palace.

"Old Ancestor, what should we do?" Everyone was tense, looking to the peak of an era's master for a solution.

"There is no way. If the era treasure fully unleashes its power, it's equivalent to an era master's attack. It cannot be resisted!" The old ancestor said with a grim face.

"At this moment, we can only see how many times the Yin-Yang Twin Fish can withstand it and how many times this Ming King's heir can activate it!" The old ancestor said with a grim face.

"This time, you're all dead!" Mingzhenyan looked at the gray palace with reverence and spoke to Luo Tian's group.

"Unity of Yin and Yang! Invincible! What a bunch of royal clans, all suppressed!" A low roar rose from the Yin-Yang Twin Fish, transforming into a Taijitu and then into the Divine and Demon Path Map. It appeared before everyone's eyes, its power shocking and making Luo Tian's group look with amazement.

"It should be able to withstand it!" Zheng Xin couldn't help but speak, looking at the equally overwhelming Divine and Demon Path Map.

"Boom..." The gray palace, like a mountain, descended upon Luo Tian's group. Their hearts trembled.

Black and white energy surrounded the Divine and Demon Path Map, colliding with the gray palace with a thunderous sound.

"Crack..." The deafening sound echoed, breaking through the stars. A violent wave erupted from their collision, sending Luo Tian's group flying backward.

On the other side, Ming Huan and Mingzhenyan also had no surprise. Their bodies flew backward, their faces pale.

A series of loud sounds echoed on the space ship. Luo Tian's group all clung to the space ship, their mouths bleeding as the massive space ship trembled violently, seemingly about to be overturned.

"This is the power of an era treasure!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. He felt that if he were crushed by the Ming King's Palace, he would not survive even a breath.

A crackling sound echoed. The illusory Divine and Demon Path Map shattered, and the Yin-Yang Twin Fish quickly separated, returning to Luo Tian and Sun Kelnian's sides.

"Kid, I did my best!" The voice of the Yin Fish soul echoed in Luo Tian's mind. He sighed longingly, his eyes filled with a bitter smile.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian collected the Yin Fish and then looked at Ming Huan with a serious expression.

At this moment, Ming Huan was also looking at Luo Tian's group. He gazed across the space with a fierce look.

"I see how many times you can withstand it!" Ming Huan's face was pale, but he still summoned the Ming King's Palace. His hands moved, and he spat blood onto it.

"I have never suffered such a big loss before. If I don't kill you, I won't stop!" Ming Huan spoke coldly. Though weak, he continued to imprint seals into the Ming King's Palace.

"Damn it!" Xuanbing Old Ancestor gritted his teeth. He then looked at Luo Tian's group and said, "You all leave. I'll block them!"

"Old Ancestor, give up!" Luo Tian shook his head gently and tried to summon the Ancient Heaven Palace. But he soon felt bitter.

"Smash!" The gray palace thundered again, with a powerful pressure descending upon Luo Tian's group.

"Go!" Xuanbing Old Ancestor slapped the space ship, knowing it could not withstand the fully activated Ming King's Palace.

"Old Ancestor!" The people of Qixing Island shouted, watching Xuanbing Old Ancestor and Luo Tian's group being carried into the void by the space ship.

"Leave too!" Xuanbing Old Ancestor spoke, his voice carrying a hint of laughter. He extended his hand to try to send Luo Tian's group out.

"No one can escape!" Ming Huan pressed his hand down on the void, and a powerful pressure immediately fell upon Luo Tian's group. It made them stop instantly.

"Really finished!" Zheng Xin and others' eyes trembled, looking at the gray palace in the sky. Their bodies shook uncontrollably.

"Epoch Book!" Luo Tian thought of a lifeline again and started to activate the Epoch Book, hoping it could once more resolve this crisis.

But the massive Ming King's Palace had already descended, radiating an overwhelming aura and suppressing everything.

"Open!" Xuanbing Old Ancestor's eyes flashed with madness. He flew over Luo Tian's group, his hands constantly forming seals. A mountain of cold energy emerged from Xuanbing Old Ancestor's hand, radiating a powerful aura.

"It's no use!" Ming Huan looked down with contempt. In the face of the true power of an era treasure, only those at the level of a near-epoch master could withstand it. Unless a true epoch master appeared, there was no way to neutralize it.

Just as Luo Tian's group felt desperate, a light laugh echoed under the stars. It made Luo Tian's group frown slightly.

"Buzz..." Golden light flashed, a golden long sword slicing through the stars like a meteor. It instantly appeared above Luo Tian's group, colliding with the descending Ming King's Palace.

The stars began to explode again. The deafening sound made Luo Tian's group's minds ring, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian's group looked at the golden divine sword hovering above them, not knowing why it had suddenly appeared as an era treasure.

"This is!" Then Luo Tian knew who the golden long sword belonged to. It was the fully developed Reincarnation Body, Zhongli Tian.

White as snow, long hair飞扬. The figure of Zhongzixuan appeared in front of everyone, a smile on his face, holding a purple jade flute.

"Few days apart, and you're already so battered!" Zhongzixuan smiled slightly, retrieving the golden long sword. He looked at Luo Tian and spoke softly.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, knowing he was saved. Zhongli Tian's long sword was no ordinary item. He had known it since his first encounter with the Dao, and later when he entered the Soul-Eating Beast, it had been collected. It was likely left for Zhongzixuan.

"Passing by," Zhongzixuan spoke softly, looking at Ming Huan. "Indeed, the Ancient King's clan is strong!"

The two gazed at each other, and beams of divine light rose between them. Ming Huan chuckled lightly, his pale face collecting the Ming King's Palace and gazing at Zhongzixuan.

"Unexpectedly, humans also have someone like you!" Ming Huan spoke softly, his voice carrying a battle spirit.

"We are all the same people. Why fight?" Zhongzixuan stood with his hands behind him, smiling at Ming Huan.

"Without fighting and killing, how can we reach that level? I think this era will be interesting!" Ming Huan sighed softly, scanning both Zhongzixuan and Luo Tian.

"I hope next time I meet someone who can fight with you!" Ming Huan spoke softly, activating the Ming King's Palace and entering it with Mingzhenyan. He then disappeared from everyone's sight.

"Count on it!" Zhongzixuan put the purple jade flute back and smiled, his aura decreasing.

"Can't keep it?" Luo Tian asked Zhongzixuan. He was surprised that Zhongzixuan let Ming Huan leave.

"Yes! Although he suffered heavy injuries, with the palace in his hands, I can't keep him. At most, I could wound him. It's not worth it. He also has a peak-era companion," Zhongzixuan sighed softly.

"Want to come to our place?" Luo Tian didn't say much. He believed Zhongzixuan's words, for Zhongli Tian had died at the hands of the Wild Clan. Zhongzixuan would certainly hate the Ancient King's clan.

"No, I haven't explored all nine realms yet. If I get tired, I'll come to your place!" Zhongzixuan shook his head lightly and scanned the group.

However, when Zhongzixuan's eyes caught sight of Chen Zhanbiao and Shi Clan Old Ancestor Shi Changming, his eyes narrowed slightly. His back's long sword emitted a series of humming sounds and rose from his back, hovering above his head.

"Wild Clan!" Zhongzixuan spoke softly. He extended a finger, and the golden long sword instantly disappeared before him, rushing toward Chen Zhanbiao.

"Brother Zhong, stop!" As Luo Tian saw the killing intent in Zhongzixuan's eyes, he immediately felt something was wrong. He moved swiftly and stood in front of Chen Zhanbiao, shouting.

"Pop..." The golden long sword pierced through Luo Tian's chest an inch and then stopped abruptly.

"Wow..." Everyone was stunned by the sudden scene, their faces filled with disbelief. They couldn't understand how Zhongzixuan, who had just helped them, suddenly changed his face.

But although the crowd was slow to react, they quickly surrounded Chen Zhanbiao and Shi Changming. They watched Zhongzixuan with caution.

"What do you mean? Explain clearly!" The golden long sword returned to Zhongzixuan's head, and a cold voice echoed from his mouth.

Chapter 1407: Searching

" He's my brother!" Luo Tian's face turned pale, his body trembling slightly. After several injuries, he had weakened to the extreme.

"Big brother!" Chen Zhanbiao quickly helped Luo Tian up, then his eyes turned red. He panted heavily and glared at Zhongzixuan.

"I'll kill you!" Chen Zhanbiao growled, seeing Luo Tian injured for him. He pushed Luo Tian to Xu Liyi and was about to fight Zhongzixuan.

"Zhanbiao!" Seeing Chen Zhanbiao about to act recklessly, Luo Tian pulled him down.

"Don't be reckless!" Luo Tian spoke. He then looked at Zhongzixuan: "Zhanbiao grew up in the Nine Realms. He didn't know he was from the Wild Clan. For years, he's been by my side. None of our friends knew he was from the Wild Clan!"

"This person did live in the Wild Clan before, but now has left it," Luo Tian introduced Shi Changming and Chen Zhanbiao to Zhongzixuan.

"Okay, I believe you once!" Zhongzixuan was not unreasonable. Seeing Luo Tian's mutual support, he sighed deeply.

For the Ancient King's clan, Zhongzixuan had no good feelings. Especially for the Wild Clan, it was an enemy of his. After all, Zhongli Tian had died at the hands of the Wild Clan.

"Then I'll take my leave. I hope you're still here when I return!" Zhongzixuan's eyes were deep, and he looked at Chen Zhanbiao with a long gaze. He then flew away into the distance, one man and one sword and flute, leaving with a carefree manner.

"Goodbye!" Luo Tian bowed to the direction Zhongzixuan left, then smiled and turned to look at everyone.

"Alright, it's finally over. We should go back!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with exhaustion.

"Let's go! Let's go! We've destroyed the Phoenix Clan. It should be peaceful for a while!" Zheng Xin and others shouted, exhausted but with excited eyes. That was a sacred place. To destroy it so easily, although Ming Huan and Mingzhenyan had escaped, it was a problem. But they would probably not come back soon. After all, both had suffered different degrees of injuries.

The group returned with joy toward the Four Saints Realm. They then discovered the space ship docked there.

"Come out!" The people of Qixing Island saw Luo Tian's group and showed a hint of joy.

"Boom..." Everyone except Xuanbing Old Ancestor fell to the ground in a messy way, panting heavily and speaking to the people of Qixing Island: "Start the ship, go back to the Four Saints Realm!"

"Roar..." A low roar echoed on the space ship. The people of Qixing Island shouted, and the space ship broke through the stars toward the direction of Tianyuan Continent in the Four Saints Realm.

The bloodstains on the ship had not yet dried, making the entire ship more astonishing. People who saw the space ship looked in shock.

"It's the people of the Four Saints Realm, and those seated at the bow are Luo Tian!"

"Has it ended? Has the Phoenix Clan been destroyed?" People discussed, looking at the massive space ship with reverence. It passed by them, radiating a killing aura.

The commotion from the Ming clan was too big. The collision of era treasures made people nervous and no one dared to go to the Ming clan for a look. After all, if they were caught in the battle, it would not be a joke.

Luo Tian's group recovered slightly and stood at the bow with a cold gaze, watching the people around them.

"Intimidation!" Seeing the people's eyes, Luo Tian knew that this mission had achieved its goal of intimidation. He believed it would not be long before the various sacred clans and tribes received news of the Phoenix Clan's destruction.

With a thunderous sound, the massive space ship returned to the Four Saints Realm and appeared outside Tianyuan Continent. It hovered over Tianyuan Continent, like a guardian of the continent.

"Back!" The entire Tianyuan Continent trembled. Seeing the massive ship, people knew that the Four Saints Realm had won. Even without mobilizing their own forces, they had destroyed the Phoenix Clan.

"Thank you all. From now on, Tianyuan Continent is your home. Welcome!" Luo Tian spoke to the people of Qixing Island.

His reason for bringing the people of Qixing Island was another purpose: to let the people on Tianyuan Continent accept the existence of Qixing Island. This would help merge the two forces.

"Ha! Finally returned to human territory!" Xuanbing Old Ancestor and Longjing were filled with excitement, watching the massive Tianyuan Continent.
