After returning to the barbarian clan, Man Hun was in a foul mood. The fact that he had passed on the "Man's Seven Stomps" to Luo Tian was discovered by the elders of the Barbarian God Temple, who severely reprimanded him. At that moment, Man Hun vented all his frustration from Luo Tian's humiliation onto Fu Xingyue.

Within moments, a hundred Star Moon Divine Guards were utterly crushed by the barbarians, leaving only Luo Tian leaping about with his speed evading their attacks.

"Hmm, this boy's speed is quite fast," Man Jiang said with a hint of interest, watching Luo Tian darting before them. He took a step toward Luo Tian.

"This won't work," Luo Tian thought, considering feigning injury to avoid standing out.

"Barbarian God's Three Stomps, terrifying even the gods!" A deep roar echoed from where Man Hun and Fu Xingyue clashed, making Luo Tian's heart stir.

"Opportunity has come!" Without hesitation, Luo Tian rushed toward Fu Xingyue's direction with a determined look, shouting, "Your Majesty, be careful!"

Fu Xingyue's face was pale, his gaze fixed on the golden foot descending upon him from the sky. A trickle of blood flowed from his lips, clearly showing he had suffered significant damage in their fight.

"Get out..." Fu Xingyue swung his Star Moon Divine Halberd, which radiated brilliant light. With a thunderous roar, it struck the golden foot.

But before Fu Xingyue could act, a golden light suddenly crashed down upon him, appearing instantly above his head. At the same time, Fu Xingyue heard Luo Tian's roar filled with resolve.

Chapter 1287: Gaining Trust

In the Wilderness City, the territory of the Star Moon Divine Clan, Luo Tian's face bore a resolute expression as he instantly appeared above Fu Xingyue.

"Hmm?" Man Hun's face suddenly changed, seeing Luo Tian beneath his "Man's Seven Stomps." He hadn't expected a late-stage Saint to be so fast.

Man Hun held back, knowing Fu Xingyue couldn't die; if he did, the war between the two clans would immediately ignite. Though the barbarians were fierce, they weren't eager to fight other royal clans.

But Man Hun hadn't expected a late-stage Saint to dare intrude into his battle with Fu Xingyue.

"You're seeking death, then I have no choice!" Man Hun sighed, his gaze on Luo Tian's resolute expression. His eyes showed admiration.

"Regrettable, this loyal guardian!" Man Hun wanted to retract his attack too late; he could only sigh softly.

"Crack..." The next moment, the golden foot crashed onto Luo Tian's body, sending him plummeting.

During his fall, Luo Tian's mind was shaken, but to make it more realistic, he forced out blood from his mouth. His body bore many defensive barriers, feeling the power of Man Hun's foot, leaving his body riddled with cracks.

"Boom..." The golden figure crashed into the ground, heavily embedding itself in the earth, creating a deep pit visible to Fu Xingyue.

In the pit, Luo Tian's body trembled violently, blood gurgling from his mouth. His eyes showed weakness.

"Xiao Mencen!" Fu Xingyue's face darkened, instantly appearing before Luo Tian. Something within him seemed stirred, and his gaze toward Luo Tian changed.

The Star Moon Divine Clan, due to their status, Fu Xingyue had always been aloof. Within the Star Moon Divine Clan, several princes vied fiercely, constantly scheming against each other. Fu Xingyue had grown up in coldness and never trusted anyone.

But Luo Tian's selfless rescue touched him, even if Luo Tian seemed overconfident. If Fu Xingyue had taken that foot's strike, his current state would have suffered serious injuries. That would make him lose face among the other royal prodigies.

"What wishes do you still have unfulfilled? I can help fulfill them!" Fu Xingyue knew that with Luo Tian's strength, being crushed by Man Hun meant certain death.

"I..." Luo Tian's eyes showed bitterness. He rolled his eyes, appearing as if dying, his body covered in swirling spiritual patterns, looking like he had no chance of regenerating.

"What?" Fu Xingyue watched Luo Tian rolling his eyes, his expression showing anxiety. He quickly spoke.

"I..." Luo Tian lifted his hand but seemed unable to, speaking while blood flowed from his lips.

"If Xiao Dezhu saw this performance, he'd definitely say 'well done'!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, rolling his eyes again, his body trembling.

"What? Speak quickly!" Fu Xingyue extended a hand, sending waves of epoch power into Luo Tian's body to save his life for a while.

"I... I want to say... there might still be hope..." Luo Tian spoke haltingly, as if partially healed by Fu Xingyue's epoch power. He slowly raised his hand and tapped his storage pouch.

"Buzz..." Blood stained the storage pouch, while waves spread outward. A jade bottle fell into Fu Xingyue's view.

"An elixir?" Fu Xingyue grabbed the jade bottle, his face showing confusion. He slowly opened it.

"Buzz..." A dense herbal power instantly spread into everyone's minds. The plants and trees across the Star Moon Divine Clan territory grew wildly under this power.

"A High-Grade Sacred Elixir!" Everyone's faces showed disbelief, staring at Fu Xingyue's jade bottle with intense shock.

"He actually has a High-Grade Sacred Elixir!" Fu Xingyue spoke in disbelief. He knew Luo Tian had elixirs, but he hadn't expected him to possess a High-Grade Sacred Elixir.

High-Grade Sacred Elixirs were precious in the Nine Domains, especially in the Origin Domain. Even High-Grade Sacred Elixirs were rare there; they were nearly unattainable in the Origin Domain because few alchemists existed among the Ancient Kings. This made elixirs even more precious within the Ancient King clans.

Fu Xingyue's face was complex. If it were usual, he would have ignored Luo Tian's fate and taken the elixir himself.

But recalling Luo Tian's resolute gaze, his hand trembled slightly.

"Fu Xingyue, give me this elixir, and I'll overlook Luo Tian's trespass into the Barbarian God Temple!" Man Hun panted, staring at Fu Xingyue's elixir.

With a High-Grade Sacred Elixir, Man Hun was confident his strength would rise another level. The barbarians focused on body refinement; after refinement, they often suffered lingering effects requiring herbs to alleviate. But elixirs were far more effective than herbs. The barbarian clan had a few alchemists, but they were all human slaves captured and forced to refine elixirs. None could produce a High-Grade Sacred Elixir.

"Daydreaming!" Fu Xingyue thought, then placed the elixir into Luo Tian's mouth, letting him sigh in relief.

In truth, Luo Tian was gambling—betting Fu Xingyue would give him the elixir. If not, he'd have to expose himself and reclaim it. After all, without the elixir, he had no excuse to survive.

The injured Star Moon Guards watching Fu Xingyue's actions showed touched expressions, their gazes toward him changing.

"Slave!" They had known since following Fu Xingyue that they were his slaves, their lives at his whim.

But now, Fu Xingyue had given such a precious High-Grade Sacred Elixir to Luo Tian. This moved them.

"I feel my wounds aren't so severe!" A mid-stage Saint Star Moon Guard struggled to stand, his body glowing with radiant light as he repaired his broken ribs.

"I can still fight; I won't disgrace Your Majesty!" A Star Moon Guard missing an arm stood resolutely, his severed limb regenerating.

"I do too... I do too..." One by one, the Star Moon Guards struggled to their feet behind Fu Xingyue, eyes showing respect.

"Good!" Fu Xingyue's eyes glowed with intensity, watching the wounded Star Moon Guards. He knew now these Star Moon Guards had truly accepted him as their master.

"Man Hun, are you still continuing?" Fu Xingyue's eyes darkened as he addressed Man Hun.

"Enough!" Man Hun, seeing Fu Xingyue's Star Moon Guards, shook his head. He didn't want to escalate matters; he had been too hasty earlier.

A surge of green vitality rose from Luo Tian, who slowly opened his eyes. His aura soared into the heavens as he reached into the void, gathering vast spiritual energy into his body.

"Half-Era?" Feeling Luo Tian's sudden surge in power, Fu Xingyue and Man Hun's faces changed abruptly.

"Too变态! This is what a Half-Era level looks like?" Man Jiang and other barbarians were stunned, not expecting this Star Moon Divine Clan member to ascend so quickly after taking a High-Grade Sacred Elixir. Not only had his life-threatening wounds healed, but his cultivation had skyrocketed to a Half-Era level.

"This should be enough!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his face showing ecstatic joy. This was the method he could think of to rapidly boost his cultivation without suspicion.

"Haha!" Fu Xingyue laughed, satisfaction in his eyes as he watched Luo Tian's ecstatic expression. He stepped forward and patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

"Fu Xingyue, this matter is settled, but I must remind you not to target our Barbarian God Temple again. If there's another time, the consequences won't be so simple!" Man Hun glanced at Luo Tian before addressing Fu Xingyue.

"Goodbye!" Fu Xingyue sneered, ignoring Man Hun and turning to Luo Tian: "Would you like to follow me? The position of Grand Commander is yours!"

"I've been waiting for this! Otherwise, my High-Grade Sacred Elixir would have been wasted!" Luo Tian inwardly chuckled but showed a look of humility.

"I just joined Your Majesty, and I'm already made Grand Commander. I fear the others won't respect me. I'd rather be a regular Star Moon Guard, risking my life for Your Majesty!" Luo Tian's eyes showed solemnity as he addressed Fu Xingyue.

"Flattery!" A figure behind Man Hun, Man Long, saw Luo Tian's solemn expression and sneered.

"You speak such words! You risked your life to save me; who wouldn't respect you?" Fu Xingyue, hearing Luo Tian's words, showed even more admiration.

"Yes! Your Majesty is right, Xiao Commander. Who would I not respect? I only respect you!" A sharp-featured youth, seeing Fu Xingyue's intense admiration for Luo Tian, quickly spoke.

"Hmm!" Hearing the youth's words, Fu Xingyue glanced at him, satisfaction in his eyes.

"Yes! Grand Commander, if anyone doesn't respect you, they'll have to step over my corpse... No one is worthy of being Grand Commander except you!" Seeing Fu Xingyue's satisfaction, other Star Moon Guards spoke loudly.

"Fine! I'll temporarily hold this position; Your Majesty can change your mind anytime," Luo Tian said, showing humility as he bowed to the Star Moon Guards.

"Change your mind? I, Fu Xingyue, as a prince, speak with ninefold authority!" Fu Xingyue patted Luo Tian's shoulder and spoke loudly.

"You'll regret it!" Luo Tian inwardly sneered, his face showing gratitude and tears.

Chapter 1288: Journey to the Star Moon Divine Clan

In the Wildness City, at a vast teleportation array's edge, Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue stood there with 100 Star Moon Guards behind them. Their faces bore bitterness, eyes showing resentment, especially when seeing the barbarians' disdainful gazes toward them.

Seven days had passed since their last clash. The group's wounds were fully healed, even Fu Xingyue's injuries had completely recovered.

But seven days had spread the news of their clash across the Wildness City, especially Fu Xingyue's defeat by Man Hun. This news spread throughout the Wildness City, not just among the barbarians but also other Ancient King clans.

"Damn it!" Fu Xingyue's face darkened, watching the disdainful gazes around him. His breath quickened; he longed to grab his Star Moon Divine Halberd and fight Man Hun again.

"Your Majesty shouldn't be angry. We can't gain anything here; we need to plan carefully," Luo Tian's eyes gleamed as he addressed Fu Xingyue.

Luo Tian was also surprised at how fast the news spread, as if manipulated by someone. In such a short time, even other clans knew about it. He vaguely sensed a conspiracy against the Star Moon Divine Clan and the barbarians.

"Let's go!" Fu Xingyue, now considering Luo Tian a trusted ally, believed his words. He stepped onto the teleportation array.

Fu Xingyue and Luo Tian had planned to return to the Star Moon Divine Clan first. Originally, Fu Xingyue's visit to the barbarians had two goals: one was entering Sea's Corner to find the Purple Aura Chain, and the second was persuading the Star Moon Divine Clan's elders to help the barbarians destroy Seven-Star Island. But neither goal had been achieved.

Over a hundred people stepped onto the teleportation array, but to other barbarians, it looked like they were leaving in disgrace.

"Fu Xingyue, are you ready?" Man Hun stood outside the teleportation array, addressing Fu Xingyue and personally activating it—a gesture of respect.

But to Fu Xingyue, this was a blatant provocation; it clearly aimed to humiliate him.

"Man Hun, I remember this grudge. Next time, the result won't be so simple!" Fu Xingyue stood within the teleportation array, addressing Man Hun.

"Always ready!" Man Hun wasn't one to back down; he强势ly responded, raising his hand and sending a massive wave of power into the teleportation array.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at the imposing Barbarian God Temple, his eyes showing resentment. He knew the entrance to the Nine Domains was within the Barbarian God Temple, but he couldn't enter.

The teleportation power activated, and Luo Tian, Fu Xingyue, and the 100 Star Moon Guards vanished from the barbarians' sight.

In truth, Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue could have flown back from the barbarian continent, but the 100 Star Moon Guards couldn't. Flying took much longer than teleportation.

"Buzz..." The familiar teleportation power acted on Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue, feeling the surrounding space constantly shifting. They could only wait.

But as they waited to arrive at the Star Moon Continent, waves of energy suddenly roared in their ears, causing Luo Tian and others to stagger.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian's heart trembled, sensing a sudden shock. This was the teleportation moment; if something went wrong, they might lose their lives.

In an instant, a gray hand tore through the void, carrying immense pressure and instantly appearing before Luo Tian's group.

"Damn it! Someone is attacking us!" Fu Xingyue also felt the energy waves, his expression darkening.

The gray hand didn't strike Luo Tian's group but suddenly appeared in the surrounding void, causing them to immediately break free from the teleportation power and appear in the gray void.

"This is a cultivator's aura! Someone wants to ambush us!" Fu Xingyue's eyes showed fear, immediately summoning his Star Moon Divine Halberd to emit light and protect Luo Tian's group. Otherwise, they'd be expelled into unknown places within moments.

"Who is it? Who has such power to block the teleportation array!" Luo Tian's eyes widened, stunned by the opponent's skill. He hadn't expected an Ancient King clan to have such a cultivator.

"The weakest is at the Era-End stage! All Ancient King clans have only a few Era-End cultivators. I don't know who this elder is, but please reveal yourself!" Fu Xingyue, clearly experienced, showed respect as he addressed the void.

But the opponent didn't want Fu Xingyue to know who they were, aiming to secretly eliminate them.

The gray hand again came with overwhelming power, emitting an aura that could suppress everything, pressing down on Fu Xingyue's group protected by the Star Moon Divine Halberd.

"Who are you? Is it the barbarians?" Luo Tian felt a wave of confusion, his eyes showing despair as he saw the gray hand.

"It might be another clan trying to provoke a war between us!" Luo Tian quickly dismissed the possibility of it being the barbarians.

"Regardless of who you are, I'm here too!" Luo Tian inwardly shouted; he didn't care about clan battles but valued his life.

At Era-End level, Luo Tian's group had no chance of resistance. Even Fu Xingyue felt despair.

But as Luo Tian's group despaired, a soft cough echoed in the starry void, and a golden character "Life" thundered down, appearing above Luo Tian's group. It destroyed the sky and collided with the gray hand.

"Pu..." The Star Moon Guards spat blood, their eyes showing weakness. Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue also had pale faces, blood flowing from their mouths.

"Boom..." Thunder formed under the gray void, and a fierce storm swept over Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue's bodies, scattering them.

A series of spatial rifts opened, Luo Tian felt a force he couldn't resist tearing him away from the Star Moon Divine Halberd's protection.

Not only Luo Tian, but others except Fu Xingyue were scattered from the Star Moon Divine Halberd's protection and suddenly pulled into spatial rifts.

"Xiao Mencen!" Fu Xingyue's face changed as he saw Luo Tian being pulled into a spatial rift, his eyes showing anxiety. He activated the Star Moon Divine Halberd and chased after Luo Tian's direction.

But in an instant, the massive spatial rift suddenly sealed itself, making Fu Xingyue's face completely dark.

"Damn it!" The void was now only filled with Xiao Mencen and the corpses of Star Moon Guards killed by the collision of two cultivators.

"Buzz..." The gray hand suddenly descended again, as if not stopping until Fu Xingyue was dead. It rushed toward him again.

"Want to kill me!" Fu Xingyue's eyes showed madness, spitting blood onto his Star Moon Divine Halberd.

"Open!" Fu Xingyue activated the Star Moon Divine Halberd, breaking through space without hesitation and diving into it.

"Hmph!" As Fu Xingyue just dove into the spatial rift, a cold sneer echoed out. A crimson character "Death" appeared again, colliding with the gray hand and collapsing vast voids before finally calming down.

After their collision, they didn't continue attacking, allowing the gray void to return to calmness.

...

The Star Moon Continent, like the barbarian continent, was ruled by the Star Moon Divine Clan. Unlike the barbarian continent, it resembled a human habitat. The highest ruler of the Star Moon Continent was the Star Moon Divine City, just as Wildness City was the sole city of the barbarian continent.

The Star Moon Continent had severe class divisions. The highest ruler was the Star Moon Divine Emperor, Fu Xingyue's father. No one knew his name; even if they did, no one dared to speak it aloud.

Tianlang Mountain, a territory of the Tianlang Clan under the Star Moon Divine Clan. Its people lived there.

The Tianlang Clan was one of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans, famous across the Star Moon Continent. The Tianlang Clan was one of the three major armies under the Star Moon Empire, subordinate to the eldest prince Fu Xingyang. The entire Star Moon Continent called it the "Xiangyang Army" or sometimes "Tianlang Army."

Tianlang Mountain was one of the Tianlang Clan's territories, providing fresh blood to the massive Tianlang Army. At this moment, the Tianlang Clan was selecting members to join the Xiangyang Army, heading for the Star Moon Divine City, the capital of the Star Moon Continent.

But as the Tianlang Clan was selecting, a frantic voice suddenly echoed in the sky, causing the Tianlang Clan's people to flee downward.

"Make way..." Luo Tian's body moved, falling toward a mountain peak.

"Boom..." Luo Tian fell onto a Tianlang Mountain with a狼狈 expression, and as he fell, the massive mountain collapsed, sending up clouds of dust.

"What happened?" A middle-aged Tianlang Clan member with a wolf's head and human body looked at the approaching dust, speaking in disbelief.

Chapter 1289: The Noble Star Moon Divine Clan

"My god, I saw a streak of light, and then the entire Tianlang Mountain exploded!" The Tianlang Clan's people showed shock.

"Damn it, dare to smash Tianlang Mountain; I think he doesn't want to live! No matter who it is, we'll tear him apart!" The Tianlang Clan's people showed anger, looking at the swirling dust.

"I think we don't need to tear him apart; he'll die from the fall himself!" One Tianlang Clan member spoke, his voice trembling.

"Also, Tianlang Mountain is so solid, made from Tianlang Gold Essence. It was smashed like that; even a Saint at the early stage would have died!" The Tianlang Clan's people discussed.

But in an instant, a cough echoed from the dust, making the Tianlang Clan's people show shock.

"Still alive?" The Tianlang Clan's people were completely shocked, not expecting this creature to still be alive.

"Surely he's severely injured; everyone attack and kill him! Dare to smash our Tianlang Mountain, he doesn't want to live!" The middle-aged Tianlang Clan member who spoke first shouted, emitting a golden wave of energy toward the dust.

"Roar..." A wolf's howl echoed, and each Tianlang Clan member also roared, emitting colorful waves of energy that converged into one, rushing toward the swirling dust.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's head rang; he was completely disoriented, not knowing what he had collided with. He just felt it was very hard.

Staggering to his feet, although Tianlang Mountain was extremely solid, Luo Tian was an early-stage Era cultivator with a terrifying body. If it weren't for the terrifying spatial repulsion, he wouldn't have been so disheveled.

But as Luo Tian just stood up, he felt a terrifying wave of power instantly rushing toward him, making his eyebrows slightly furrow.

"I warned you to make way while I was falling! You still want to kill me!" Luo Tian, though unable to control his fall direction, could sense these Tianlang Clan members' strength. The strongest among them was only at the early-stage Saint level.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound instantly echoed on Luo Tian's body, and the dust just settled down again, more violently.

The Tianlang Clan's attacks were powerful, but Luo Tian's strength was far beyond these Tianlang Clan members. How could they harm Luo Tian?

"Dead!" The Tianlang Clan's people showed bloodthirsty eyes, watching the dust that had just stirred up.

"Hmph..." But in an instant, a terrifying aura rose from the dust, instantly making nearly ten thousand Tianlang Clan members kneel on the ground, their eyes filled with fear.

"This is..." The middle-aged Tianlang Clan member, the highest among these ten thousand, at early-stage Saint level.

The dust dispersed, and Luo Tian's figure appeared before the countless Tianlang Clan members, making their faces change abruptly, their bodies trembling more.

"Star Moon Divine Clan!"

"My god, we just attacked a Star Moon Divine Clan member! This is a capital crime!"

"Why is this Star Moon Divine Clan member not staying in the Star Moon Divine City but coming to our Tianlang Mountain!" The Tianlang Clan members' hearts cried out, looking at Luo Tian whose aura alone suppressed them. Their eyes showed begging for mercy.

"Is the racial hierarchy so severe?" Luo Tian saw the Tianlang Clan members' gazes toward him, sighing inwardly.

He had never seen such a race before—wolf-headed and human-bodied, all looking at him with fear. Luo Tian had heard of the Star Moon Divine Clan's high status across the Star Moon Continent, but he hadn't expected it to be so high. Just one identity was enough to make these Tianlang Clan members submit.

"Where is this?" Luo Tian didn't want to attack these Tianlang Clan members, as he had destroyed their property first.

"Respectful Lord of the Clan, this is Tianlang Mountain, a territory of the Tianlang Clan!" The middle-aged wolf-man showed strong respect as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Ah, what are you doing?" Luo Tian asked again, not directly asking for a map or the Star Moon Divine City's location. If he did, it would raise suspicion. After all, he was now a Star Moon Divine Clan member; how could he not know the Star Moon Continent or the location of the Star Moon Divine City?

"We are preparing to organize our forces and head to the Star Moon Divine City for the Xiangyang Army's selection!" The middle-aged Tianlang Clan member naturally answered.

"Good! I've been injured and need to rest; I'll go with you to the Star Moon Divine City!" Luo Tian waved his sleeve, showing authority.

"Yes!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the entire Tianlang Clan was overjoyed. Not attacking them was already a great blessing;更何况 they were Star Moon Divine Clan members. If they could establish some connection, it would be even better.

Luo Tian didn't move; he knew the more arrogant he appeared, the fewer flaws he would have. If he was approachable, it might invite suspicion.

At the same time, Luo Tian also released his aura, allowing the Tianlang Clan members to regain their freedom. As soon as they could move, the entire Tianlang Clan started acting.

"Lang Liu, go get that purple gold chair from our clan and prepare some soft items to prevent the master's journey from being bumpy!" The middle-aged Tianlang Clan member immediately instructed.

"Respectful Lord of the Clan, I am Lang Ya. Please give your orders!" Lang Ya showed a fawning smile, approaching Luo Tian and bowing.

"There's no order; just do it well. If you perform well, I won't disappoint you!" Luo Tian sneered, throwing a jade bottle into Lang Ya's hands. Then he sat down as if starting to heal.

"This!" Lang Ya opened the bottle, his expression changed immediately, looking at Luo Tian with even more respect.

Tianlang Mountain was just a minor branch of the Tianlang Clan. Even Lang Ya, who had never seen elixirs much in his life, knew that even Star Moon Divine Clan members in the Star Moon Divine City found it difficult to obtain elixirs. Yet this clan's youth had immediately given a High-Grade Sacred Elixir, making Lang Ya guess Luo Tian's identity.

Thus, Lang Ya worked even harder, constantly praising Luo Tian while preparing everything for his journey.

Not long after, under the entire Tianlang Mountain clan's effort, a chair radiating purple light was carried out by several Tianlang Clan members.

"Respectful Lord of the Clan, please sit!" Lang Ya showed respect and addressed Luo Tian who was meditating.

"Buzz..." As Lang Ya's words finished, Luo Tian vanished from his original spot and appeared on the purple gold chair. It felt incredibly soft beneath him.

"A carriage!" Luo Tian inwardly chuckled; this wasn't a chair at all, but a large vehicle.

"You're still looking? Don't you know to let the master rest?" Lang Ya, standing among the crowd, spoke with a proud chest.

"No need! I need to heal; don't disturb me!" But before the wolf clan's attendants could approach, Luo Tian coldly spoke.

"Yes, yes! I didn't consider it carefully; all of you go back!" Lang Ya quickly spoke, dismissing the wolf clan's attendants. Then he instructed the Tianlang Clan members to depart.

"Go!" Several Tianlang Clan members carried Luo Tian, stepping out of Tianlang Mountain. Behind them followed nearly a hundred young Tianlang Clan members.

The Tianlang Clan was a major clan on the Star Moon Continent, though its status was much lower than the Star Moon Divine Clan. Still, other Ancient Clans dared not provoke the Tianlang Clan. Especially with a Star Moon Divine Clan member at the front, making this large group noticeable but unchallenged.

Luo Tian learned about the Star Moon Continent's situation during the journey. Lang Ya led these young Tianlang Clan members, all at the Superb stage. The Star Moon Divine City also had Tianlang Clan members responsible for selecting true talents from these branches to join the Tianlang Army, i.e., the Xiangyang Army under the eldest prince.

The entire Tianlang Mountain, including Lang Ya, aimed to have one or two people enter the Tianlang Army. If they truly entered, their status within the Tianlang Clan would change significantly, possibly even being summoned into the Star Moon Divine City's true Tianlang Clan. It depended on the young people's achievements in the Tianlang Army.

After seven days of travel, they finally reached the Star Moon Continent's core area—the Star Moon Divine City.

"Ah! This Star Moon Divine City is much stronger than Wildness City!" Luo Tian showed admiration, watching the moon and a star alternately shining above it. He knew this was the Star Moon Divine City's symbol.

"Finally arrived! I remember my last visit to the Star Moon Divine City was when I participated in selecting for the Tianlang Army. It's been three hundred years since then!" Lang Ya showed admiration, speaking softly.

People entered the Star Moon Divine City continuously; this time wasn't just Tianlang Mountain's people but also other places' Tianlang Clan members sending their clan members.

Groups of Tianlang Clan members entered the Star Moon Divine City one after another, but Luo Tian's group remained eye-catching. The chair beneath him was too obvious—purple light radiating, and a Star Moon Divine Clan member sitting on it.

"Hmph! Who dares to be more eye-catching than me? They must want to die!" A group of Tianlang Clan members had a young man in fine robes, his eyes showing annoyance. He looked at Luo Tian sitting on the purple gold chair and sneered.

Chapter 1290: Xiangyang Army

The young man wore fine robes, his eyes showing annoyance. His beauty was unmistakable—this was a Star Moon Divine Clan member because beauty and eyes were the clan's greatest features.

"Respectful Lord of the Clan, should I teach that Tianlang Mountain group a lesson?" Hearing the young man's words, a middle-aged man showed flattery and addressed him.

"Good. That kid seems unfamiliar; he probably has no big background! Teaching him a lesson is fine. Just take the chair and don't kill anyone!" The young man spoke coldly, his voice showing indifference. Due to his status, few people in the Star Moon Divine Clan could he not offend. Luo Tian was someone he had never seen before, so the young man categorized him as a regular Star Moon Divine Clan member.

"Lang Ya! I didn't expect to meet you here!" The middle-aged man, after receiving the young man's permission, smiled and led his clan members toward Luo Tian's group. He spoke loudly.

From the beginning, the Star Moon Divine Clan young man hadn't looked at Luo Tian once. He stood among the crowd, waiting for that purple light chair to be delivered to him. His inner anger was evident; how could someone have such a flashy move? Why hadn't he thought of it?

"Lang Xing?" Hearing someone call him, Lang Ya looked at the source of the voice. His face changed immediately, especially when seeing the young man surrounded by Lang Xing. Lang Ya's expression became even more difficult.

"Kou Fenghua! Why is he here?" Lang Ya's heart sank, seeing the young man in fine robes. He clearly recognized him.
