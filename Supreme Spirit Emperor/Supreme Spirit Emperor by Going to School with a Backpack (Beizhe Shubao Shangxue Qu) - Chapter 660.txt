"Master!" Zhou Yanhao gazed at Luotian, who stood motionless beside him, and exclaimed in astonishment. He had not expected Luotian to appear so suddenly.

"Zhou Xiong!" Shen Tianchang was also taken aback, his body trembling slightly before a cruel expression spread across his face.

"Unexpectedly, you've come to me. I'll kill you both and accept whatever punishment awaits me in Eternal Life Mountain!" Shen Tianchang bellowed, sensing Zhou Xiong's mind was addled.

"Master, flee!" Zhou Yanhao shouted desperately. He knew Shen Tianchang's might—once a figure he had revered, now still leagues beyond his capacity to challenge. His master was formidable, but this man was an Immortal King.

"Who will live and who will die remains uncertain," Luotian softly shook his head, extending his spiritual awareness to scan the surroundings. Upon finding no one nearby, a faint smile touched his lips.

"Little Half-Step Immortal King dares to show off before me. I'll crush you now!" Shen Tianchang's hands moved, and a green seal materialized from the void, descending upon Luotian with crushing force.

"You are no longer Grand Master. Whether you live to hold the title is uncertain..." Luotian spoke softly, but his attack was not aimed at Shen Tianchang. Instead, he struck Zhou Yanhao's head with a single palm, sealing him with divine patterns and rendering him unconscious.

"Don't resist? If you renounce your cultivation, I might spare your life and have you serve my sister!" Shen Tianchang's eyes gleamed with amusement as he stood aloft, holding the green seal that radiated terrifying energy.

"Resistance is inevitable. It's not resistance—it's merely crushing your existence!" Luotian chuckled, gathering Zhou Yanhao before him.

"Domain!" Shen Tianchang roared, and an invisible domain instantly enveloped Luotian. Simultaneously, the seal descended with his full power.

With confidence etched on his face, Shen Tianchang watched the seal fly toward Luotian. Yet he puzzled over why Zhou Xiong's face remained serene, suspecting the man's mind was impaired.

"Roar..." A guttural cry echoed from Shen Tianchang, and a grey domain materialized instantly, solid as stone.

Zhao zhang... Qian zhang... Four thousand zhang... Ten thousand zhang... The soul's roar shattered the air, and Shen Tianchang's expression darkened as his domain was crushed like paper.

In an instant, Luotian moved. His foot struck the earth, and the mountain crumbled beneath him, transforming into a streak of light that surged toward Shen Tianchang.

"You're not Half-Step Immortal King!" Almost as Luotian moved, Shen Tianchang sensed his terrifying power.

The streak pierced the seal. Shen Tianchang's seal was useless before Luotian, who shattered it with a single punch.

As Shen Tianchang gaped in shock, Luotian's form materialized before him. Shen Tianchang's face contorted with fear as he turned to flee—but a domain force pinned his body.

"Boom..." Blood mist erupted, and Shen Tianchang's body was shattered into crimson mist that rained from the sky.

"Too weak!" Luotian chuckled, vanishing from the spot and flying away into the distance.

...

On a green mountain, Zhou Yanhao slowly regained consciousness. His gaze was bewildered before he saw the old man standing beside him.

"Master, are you alright?" Zhou Yanhao hurriedly rose, bowing respectfully to Luotian.

"Nothing serious. Go. Do as I said. Take this jade vial, and open it at the place I mentioned. Remember!" Luotian handed Zhou Yanhao a jade vial containing the true Zhou Xiong.

"Yes!" Though Zhou Yanhao had many questions, he obeyed Zhou Xiong's orders without hesitation.

"Go!" Luotian took flight toward Eternal Life Mountain.

"What happened to your master?" Zhou Yanhao tucked the vial away, pondering what Luotian had given him. He wasn't foolish; years of following Zhou Xiong made him sense the drastic change in his master, far different from before.

"It's as if two people!" Zhou Yanhao mused, taking flight toward Nine Heavens City.

After half a day, Luotian returned to Eternal Life Mountain. Upon entering the inner sect's courtyard, he immediately heard of Shen Tianchang's death.

"Zhou Xiong, come to the Enforcement Hall!" As Luotian sat down, Zhang Yuting's voice echoed in his mind. Killing an Immortal King was no small matter; the Enforcement Hall would investigate thoroughly, and Zhang Yuting's first suspicion fell on Luotian and Lu Tianjiu, who had clashed with Shen Tianchang.

Luotian rose and entered the Enforcement Hall. This time, it wasn't just Zhang Yuting alone—two Half-Step Immortal Kings flanked him. Moreover, Luotian sensed a powerful spiritual awareness enveloping the hall.

"A Master-level Immortal!" Luotian's eyes flickered. This spiritual awareness was likely Zhang Yuting's hidden strength.

A Master-level Immortal was rare among the Nine Immortal Mountains. It was likely a senior from Eternal Life Palace.

As Luotian arrived, Lu Tianjiu also entered the hall, his face showing anxiety. He knew he was suspected—after all, he had just taken over Shen Tianchang's Grand Master position.

"You must know why I summoned you two. Speak!" Zhang Yuting smiled, addressing them both.

"I've been handling the Promotion Hall's affairs since this morning. The disciples and elders of the Promotion Hall can attest to that!" Lu Tianjiu spoke cautiously.

"I went out to search for treasures. The other Grand Masters should know I obtained a heritage, which is why I've gained this strength. I went back to explore it again."

"This is a treasure I obtained from that heritage. Elders and Grand Masters, it can testify for me. Moreover, as a Half-Step Immortal King, could I possibly kill an Immortal King at the initial stage?"

"Also, I'm not foolish. But I don't lack common sense. Killing Shen Elder would surely implicate both me and Lu Grand Master. We wouldn't do such a foolish act, right?" Luotian spoke loudly, then produced the Supplemental Heaven Stone.

"You..." The Supplemental Heaven Stone was stunned. It hadn't expected to be revealed by Luotian, leaving it momentarily dazed.

A palm-sized stone was held in Luotian's hand, instantly drawing attention. All present were seasoned veterans who could sense the stone's uniqueness.

"What is this?" Zhang Yuting asked, his eyes filled with greed, unhidden.

"It's a stone. But this one is different—it speaks!" Luotian replied to Zhang Yuting.

"Zhou Xiong, you bastard!" Hearing Luotian's words, the Supplemental Heaven Stone spoke rudely.

"Truly speaks!" People became even more curious about Luotian, momentarily forgetting to ask about Shen Tianchang's death.

"Would you like to buy this stone? Name your price!" Zhang Yuting offered Luotian.

"This..." Luotian feigned hesitation, but inwardly he was laughing. Zhang Yuting had taken the bait.

"afraid you can't afford it!" Luotian thought, gazing at Zhang Yuting. Seeing Luotian's expression, Zhang Yuting furrowed his brows slightly, locking eyes with him, making Luotian feel a threat.

"Boy, give me this stone and I'll take you as my disciple!" Just as Luotian prepared to refuse, a deep voice echoed through the hall. A senior appeared, clad in green robes with strange patterns—especially a flower on his chest that exuded an eerie aura.

"Respectful greetings to Senior of Eternal Life Palace!" As the senior appeared, everyone in the hall, including Zhang Yuting, bowed to him.

Eternal Life Palace overshadowed the other sects. Only eight individuals held such status, each with unparalleled authority.

"Respectful greetings to my master!" Luotian quickly bowed, changing his address. This was too good an opportunity to miss.

"Zhou Xiong, you bastard! You're not human for giving me away!" The Supplemental Heaven Stone's voice rang out, truly enraged. It nearly shouted Luotian's name.

"Haha, good!" The senior laughed heartily, his face showing satisfaction. He extended a hand to seize the still-cursing Supplemental Heaven Stone.

"Little stone, from now on, you'll follow me!" The senior smiled at the Supplemental Heaven Stone, his gaze filled with awe.

"Looking at what? Never seen such a handsome stone before?" The Supplemental Heaven Stone glared at the senior, nearly drooling as it cursed.

"Congratulations, Senior Chen, on obtaining a rare stone!" The hall's people quickly offered their congratulations, though they sighed inwardly, knowing it was out of their reach.

"Senior Chen Tianqi. From now on, you are my disciple. Everyone, disperse!" The senior laughed and exited the hall. Naturally, this matter was now concluded.

"Hope he returns to Eternal Life Palace. Once the Supplemental Heaven Stone is inside, it'll be easier!" Luotian's face showed reverence as he mused.

Senior Chen left. As for Shen Tianchang's murder, it naturally went unanswered. Lu Tianjiu had witnesses; as for Luotian, he was now Senior Chen's disciple. Who dared to act?

"Brother Zhou, I'll need your continued support!" Warm voices echoed in Luotian's ears as people began to chat with him.

Chapter 2474: Midnight Visit to Eternal Life Palace

Everyone knew Luotian had been taken in by Senior Chen for the stone. No one suspected anything else, but this relationship alone ensured no one would dare touch Luotian on Eternal Life Mountain.

After chatting with people for a while, Luotian excused himself and returned to his residence, waiting for news from the Supplemental Heaven Stone.

However, after three days of waiting, Luotian received no news from the stone. This made him extremely anxious.

Nightfall, Luotian sat cross-legged on his bed, his face dark. Five days remained until Zhang Daotian's soul vanished. If the Supplemental Heaven Stone didn't return soon, Luotian would have to find another way.

"This bastard must've really followed that old man!" Luotian cursed inwardly.

"Maybe he's just being his usual self. And I'm still here, so he definitely doesn't want to come back!" Long Que responded, making Luotian curious about what had happened between Long Que and the Supplemental Heaven Stone.

As for any danger to the stone, Luotian hadn't considered it. After all, that thing was too cunning.

"I can't wait any longer. I need to check—just try!" Luotian thought, slowly rising. Black mist obscured his body as he vanished silently from the courtyard toward Eternal Life Palace.

Luotian's cultivation was Master-level Immortal. To hide, only an Eternal Life Immortal could detect him on Eternal Life Mountain.

Carefully moving forward, Luotian finally reached the entrance of Eternal Life Palace. Under the night's darkness, the green hall stood there. Unlike daytime, it gave Luotian a cold feeling.

"How do I get in?" Luotian looked at the single door, pondering. He wasn't like the Supplemental Heaven Stone who could turn into dust.

Luotian crouched in a corner, thinking how to enter without being detected. He also prepared for battle—this was a gamble with his life, but time was pressing.

After an hour, Luotian finally found an opportunity. The bronze door of Eternal Life Palace slowly opened, and a senior stepped out—Senior Chen Tianqi.

In an instant, Luotian made his decision. He didn't follow Senior Chen but rushed into Eternal Life Palace through the door.

"Hmm?" Senior Chen's white eyebrows twitched slightly. His eyes showed confusion as he looked around, but upon recalling Eternal Life Palace's barrier, he no longer worried. He walked away.

"Can I pass through this barrier?" Luotian didn't immediately enter the hall. A barrier appeared before him, blocking his view. He stopped.

"This barrier is no simple matter."

"This must be a barrier set by someone of the same level as my peak. It's an Emperor-level creation. Only those who know how to enter can pass."

"Moreover, the person who set this barrier has exceptional skill. Even I would need to exert all my strength to break through it."

"Is there an Emperor on Eternal Life Mountain?" Long Que's voice echoed in Luotian's mind, warning him to be cautious.

"I'll try!" Luotian prayed that Guigu Zi's techniques would work, then activated his cultivation and touched the green barrier.

Guigu Dao Method—penetrating any barrier. This was what Guigu Zi left for his disciples. Only Luotian could use it now.

In the next moment, under Luotian's tense gaze, his hand entered the barrier without causing any ripples.

"It really works!" Luotian's heart surged with joy. His other hand also entered the barrier without resistance.

"Boy, you've changed so much during my absence!" Long Que's surprised voice echoed in Luotian's mind, filled with admiration.

"Let me explain later!" Luotian ignored Long Que and stepped into the barrier. As soon as he entered, the surroundings changed—no longer bronze walls but black ones. The hall was vast, spanning tens of thousands of zhang. Yet there were no people in sight. A platform hovered above the hall, with a green flower standing on it.

Divine light poured down. Though the flower was green, for some reason, it gave Luotian an eerie feeling—reminding him of the flower on Senior Chen's sleeve, identical to this one.

"This is..." Luotian's eyes showed confusion. Even with his knowledge, he couldn't recognize what this flower was.

The platform's divine light flowed. Blood-colored patterns moved across it, with roots extending toward the surroundings.

Luotian followed the roots' direction to the hall's edges. Each side had containers holding living people. The roots pierced their hearts, seemingly drawing blood and vitality from them, making Luotian's face dark.

"This is the Eternal Life Flower! As long as it receives vitality, it grants eternal life!"

"Unexpectedly, such a thing exists in the world!"

"The legend says the Eternal Life Flower is a divine flower, surpassing even immortal herbs. Once its secrets are understood, one can achieve eternal life!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luotian's mind, explaining.

"These people... they have the aura of three thousand world realms!" Long Que's voice continued, making Luotian's eyes flash with murderous intent.

Luotian scanned the surroundings, seeing those suffering figures. His eyes narrowed, and his fists clenched.

Familiar faces—Luotian saw familiar figures. Three people he recognized: Zhuge Qingtian, Zhongli Tian, and Xuanyuan Qiong. These were former masters of the Nine Realms.

Now, they bore no signs of their past vigor. Once top-tier warriors, even Luotian had to be cautious around them. Zhongli Tian had once nearly defeated him.

They were submerged in medicinal liquid, eyes closed. Though nourished by the liquid, they seemed unable to withstand the Eternal Life Flower's absorption. Their bodies exuded signs of decay and their vitality was weak.

"Where is Senior Chen? Why hasn't he returned!" As Luotian's heart raced, a vexed voice echoed from the platform.

Seven figures sat on the platform. Previously hidden by the massive Eternal Life Flower, their auras were concealed. Luotian hadn't noticed them.

Their auras were subdued, but Luotian sensed an immense danger from the seven. Three were Immortal Kings at the late stage, and four at the middle stage.

"Terrifying Eternal Life Mountain!" Luotian mused, anxious. He didn't act immediately, knowing if he did, he might lose his life.

"Master, help me see how long these people can live!" Luotian communicated with Long Que, pondering how to rescue them.

"About a month. Others can live half a month more. They're already at their end!" Long Que replied.

"A month..." Luotian muttered, concealing his form as he looked at the seven on the platform.

"Buzz..." As Luotian gazed again at the Eternal Life Flower, its petals trembled. The seven on the platform frowned slightly.

"The Eternal Life Flower is warning us?" One of the late-stage Immortal Kings spoke, gazing at the hall's surroundings.

"Buzz..." As he spoke, a grey mist emerged from the flower's petals, forming into an old man's figure.

"No one!"

"Who could have entered here? Even a peak Immortal King would need to alert us if they wanted to enter silently!" One elder spoke, his voice filled with confidence.

"Master!" Luotian saw the grey figure and felt his heart surge, trembling violently.

"This guy's soul was split. How is he still coming out?" One elder spoke, reaching toward the grey soul.

"Roar..." The grey soul roared, struggling desperately. But it was too weak and was immediately subdued back into the Eternal Life Flower.

"Back then, he was a top-tier prodigy. If he had grown, we might not have destroyed the Dazhuang Sect!" One elder spoke softly, then pointed a finger. A green flame entered the Eternal Life Flower.

"Roar..." An agonizing roar echoed from within the flower, striking Luotian's heart like a heavy blow.

"Go, boy!" Long Que sensed Luotian's unstable state and warned him not to act recklessly. Hearing Long Que, Luotian forced himself to suppress his urge to attack. He hadn't felt the Supplemental Heaven Stone's aura, so he moved stealthily toward the hall's door, waiting for it to open.

Time passed slowly. After half an hour, the hall's door opened, and Senior Chen stepped in.

They passed each other. Luotian vanished into Eternal Life Palace smoothly, returning to his residence.

"Pu..." Upon returning, Luotian spat blood, his aura chaotic.

"This Eternal Life Mountain is no simple place!"

"Growing the Eternal Life Flower requires blood and vitality as nourishment! The cost is too great. In this world, having the Eternal Life Flower and controlling it within these Nine Immortal Mountains is a major threat!" Long Que didn't care about Luotian's blood, but his voice was serious.

"Too weak!" Luotian spoke softly. With his current strength, he was far from capable of toppling Eternal Life Mountain.

"Regardless! First, save Master and Zhongli Tian!"

"There are five days left. I need to plan carefully, ensuring Master's safety!" Luotian's eyes showed determination and a touch of madness.

Chapter 2475: Identity Revealed

The next morning, before Luotian even opened his eyes, a figure appeared at the entrance of his courtyard—Senior Chen Tianqi.

"Zhou Xiong, come out!" Senior Chen's voice echoed. At the same time, he pushed open the door and entered Luotian's room.

"Master!" Luotian quickly rose, bowing respectfully to Senior Chen.

"Why did you go out last night? Come with me!" Senior Chen's face was dark, speaking to Luotian. Luotian felt puzzled and cautious, suspecting his identity had been exposed—after all, he'd just visited Eternal Life Palace.

"What's the matter, Master?" Luotian kept his expression calm, showing respect. His mind raced, but he knew he couldn't have been exposed—otherwise it wouldn't just be Senior Chen coming for him.

"Come, let's talk on the way!" Senior Chen spoke, leading Luotian out of his courtyard.

"Did you take this stone as your master?" As they walked, Senior Chen asked, his face showing annoyance.

For the past few days, Senior Chen had treated the Supplemental Heaven Stone well. He'd provided it with food and resources, but he hadn't succeeded in making it his master.

"Master? That's impossible. This guy may mistreat me, but he keeps me alive. Mastering such a thing once is enough. Wanting to master twice? I'd go mad!" Senior Chen thought of the Supplemental Heaven Stone's words and nearly exploded with anger.

"Uh..." Luotian instantly understood. The Supplemental Heaven Stone had been tricking and eating in Senior Chen's place these past days.

"Go, get it released. I'll reward you heavily!" Senior Chen instructed Luotian. Luotian wanted to laugh. If time allowed, leaving the Supplemental Heaven Stone in Eternal Life Mountain might be a problem.

But Luotian also sighed inwardly. The Supplemental Heaven Stone had been lucky, becoming his master by accident. He didn't know how to break the contract.

"I'll try!" Luotian replied quickly, following Senior Chen. He was also angry—he'd asked the Supplemental Heaven Stone to find a way to save Zhang Daotian, but it had been enjoying itself.

As Luotian followed Senior Chen, the surrounding disciples bowed respectfully. He didn't notice one familiar figure standing among them, gazing at him with complex emotions before showing determination.

After an hour of walking, they reached Eternal Life Palace. Luotian's eyes narrowed slightly—unexpectedly, Senior Chen had brought him into the palace.

"Remember, after seeing this, you must swear blood oaths to forget it!" Senior Chen warned Luotian before pushing open the hall's door. Senior Chen's hands moved, forming complex seals on the barrier. The barrier gradually became transparent, allowing one person through.

Though it was morning, the hall remained dim, similar to Luotian's experience last night.

"This..." Luotian feigned awe as he looked around the hall.

"Seeing the Eternal Life Flower is your three lifetimes of fortune!" Senior Chen knew Luotian would be shocked. His face showed rare pride as he led Luotian into the barrier.

"Senior Chen, why have you brought an inner sect elder in?" A shout echoed from the platform above.

"Something to do. After finishing, I'll have him swear blood oaths!" Senior Chen spoke to them, leading Luotian to a corner. There lay a red stone on the ground, surrounded by many medicinal herbs that it occasionally sucked into its mouth.

"This is the master of this Supplemental Heaven Stone, right?"

"Amazing luck! Finding such an ancient treasure and mastering it!" Seeing Luotian, the people on the platform murmured in admiration.

"What is this guy's background?" Luotian also felt curious, asking Long Que.

"Sky has a gap. Once, a great sage of the human race used this to supplement the sky, hence naming it Supplemental Heaven Stone!" Long Que replied.

"Supplemental Heaven Stone. Your master has arrived! Quickly release the contract and become my disciple!" Senior Chen spoke to the stone.

"Ah... Master, you've come!" The red stone trembled slightly at Senior Chen's words.

"Master, what's wrong with this stone? You brought it here to eat and drink for free?" Luotian smiled, walking toward the stone. Others couldn't understand his words, but the Supplemental Heaven Stone could. It was at a loss for words.

"Quickly release the contract and become my master!" Luotian spoke loudly, his eyes filled with danger as he looked at the stone.

"Cut it out. I'll be back, kid. These people are all talents, and they speak well. I really like this place!" The Supplemental Heaven Stone spoke loudly, its body glowing red.

"Seems proper!" Luotian mused. Though there was still a connection, he feigned discomfort.

"Done! But next time, wait seven days. Wait for me!" The Supplemental Heaven Stone spoke to Senior Chen.

"Would you like to follow me? I'm wealthier than Senior Chen!" One elder stood up.

"See, who performs well these days. I'll follow them!" The Supplemental Heaven Stone replied, then opened its mouth to suck in the medicinal herbs.

"You may leave!" Senior Chen smiled slightly, speaking to Luotian as he led him out of the barrier.

As soon as Senior Chen opened the barrier, the eight people's tokens emitted a buzzing sound.

At the same time, Senior Chen led Luotian out of the hall. He took out his token and furrowed his brows slightly.

"Coincidence!" The token's glow dimmed. Senior Chen looked at Luotian, his eyes showing amusement as he scrutinized him. As Senior Chen's gaze fell on himself, Luotian felt a bad premonition.

"Clang..." The Eternal Life Palace's door flew open. Seven streaks of light appeared, surrounding Luotian.

"What's going on?" Luotian's eyes narrowed slightly as he saw the seven figures surrounding him.

"Luotian, you've hidden well. How dare you infiltrate our Eternal Life Mountain!" One elder bellowed, his late-stage Immortal King power pressing down. A green domain spread out, covering two million zhang around it.

At the same time, the other seven's domains also spread out. A powerful pressure immediately pressed on Luotian.

"Damn!" Luotian's face darkened. He knew he had been exposed, but there was no time to ponder why. His aura surged with power, and he launched a punch toward Senior Chen.

"Master Long Que, please help!" Luotian transmitted to Long Que. He knew he needed to break the eight's combined attack, but with his current strength, it was impossible.

"Fast!" Senior Chen's face changed slightly. He hadn't expected Luotian to be unaffected by their domain power. In panic, he also punched.

"Boom..." The collision sound erupted, a thunderous explosion that shook the surroundings. It caused the entire Eternal Life Mountain to tremble.

"Someone is attacking Eternal Life Mountain!" The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain immediately felt the powerful fluctuation from the direction of Eternal Life Palace.

Senior Chen spat blood, his body flying back. His eyes showed shock—how could Luotian be so strong?

"Eternal Life Gate!" As Luotian had just knocked out Senior Chen, the other seven's attacks descended. Seven green doors slammed down, each radiating overwhelming power.

"I can't withstand it! Master Long Que, help me!" Luotian looked at the seven doors. Five were manageable, but the three late-stage Immortal Kings' attacks were beyond his ability to withstand.

Long Que let out a cry. It spat out a crimson lotus that flew from Luotian's body toward the seven doors.

"I need time—thirty breaths!" Luotian's face darkened. He watched the crimson lotus clash with the seven doors, producing a series of explosions. This was the best chance to save Zhang Daotian.

Eternal Life Immortals hadn't appeared. If they did, even with Long Que's help, he wouldn't be able to fight these people.

Boom boom boom...

Seven explosions. The seven Eternal Life Gates were destroyed by the crimson lotus. Long Que's form appeared, making the world change.

Fire waves swept across, causing a thunderous explosion. The approaching disciples of Eternal Life Mountain were all vomited blood, watching the flying Long Que and Luotian standing still.

"That's Zhou Xiong!" People immediately saw Luotian, who hadn't changed his appearance in time. They exclaimed.

"Zhou Xiong isn't a Half-Step Immortal King!" Zhang Yuting's face darkened. He had discovered Luotian's identity, and his side stood a young man—this young man was very familiar to Luotian. It was Zhou Xiong's disciple, the one he had sent to Tianyuan Sect—Zhou Yanhao.

At this moment, Zhou Yanhao's eyes showed madness. He had finally resisted his master's will halfway to Nine Heavens City, opened the vial and released Zhou Xiong. He had conflicted feelings but ultimately greed and ambition took over, making him return to Eternal Life Mountain to report to Zhang Yuting. He knew this would be a major achievement, and Luotian would definitely be eliminated by Eternal Life.

"Who is he?" Lu Tianjiu's face was even more incredulous. He hadn't expected Zhou Xiong, who had plotted with him to kill Shen Tianchang, was another person. Even he, an Immortal King, hadn't noticed.

"He's Luotian!" Zhang Yuting spoke to Lu Tianjiu and others, causing the disciples of Eternal Life Mountain to erupt in shock.

"He's not dead!"

"Entering the Immortal Life Mountain and surviving. He came to find death in our Eternal Life Mountain!" Everyone's eyes showed disbelief as they looked at Luotian, whose body was shrouded in black mist. His hands began to evolve.

Chapter 2476: Battle Begins

Outside Eternal Life Palace, fire waves swept across the surroundings. The entire mountain peak of Eternal Life Palace was submerged in flames. Luotian stood amidst the blazing fire, his hands constantly evolving demonic patterns and etching them onto his body.

"Use your nine-color fire!" Long Que bellowed, spitting out a torrent of flames. At the same time, Luotian pressed his fingers to his forehead, and nine-color fire surged upward.

Rippling...

The fire sea roared. The powerful flames instantly swept over Luotian, enveloping him in a blinding temperature that pierced the sky, revealing the vast expanse of stars.

"You finally came. I wasn't disappointed!" As the fire surged, a figure appeared in midair—Eternal Life Immortal King.

"I'll protect you from this old man. My condition may not last long!" Long Que set up the fire sea, bathing in ten-color fire. His massive body hovered in the sky, facing Eternal Life Immortal King.

Seeing Long Que, Eternal Life Immortal King's face slightly changed. However, after sensing Long Que's condition, he showed a hint of amusement.

"Once a great sage. Now you're just clinging to life!" Eternal Life Immortal King softly sighed, his body vanishing from the spot and rushing toward Long Que.

"If I were at my peak, I'd kill you like squashing an ant!" Long Que sneered. His tail swept across the void, striking Eternal Life Immortal King.

"Unfortunately, you're not!" Eternal Life Immortal King sneered. He blocked the sweeping tail with one hand and extended another, pointing toward Long Que.

The fire sea roared. Ten-color fists formed from the blazing flames clashed with that finger, producing a thunderous explosion echoing across heaven and earth. The wild energy swept over everything except Eternal Life Palace, annihilating many disciples who hadn't escaped in time.

"This fluctuation—unless one has a domain at the Immortal King level, no one can survive!" The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain showed fear.

"Disciples of Eternal Life Mountain, activate the protective array. The net of heaven and earth—no one must escape these intruders!" Eternal Life Immortal King shouted, his face showing mockery. He transformed into a streak of light and rushed toward Long Que.

"I want to leave, but you can't stop me!" Long Que scoffed. He opened his mouth and spat out a world-destroying crimson lotus, beginning to fight Eternal Life Immortal King.

"Buzz..." As Eternal Life Immortal King's words finished, the disciples of Eternal Life Mountain moved. Under the leadership of an Immortal King at the initial stage, they began to set up a massive array to prevent Luotian and Long Que from escaping.

On the other hand, the eight elders of Eternal Life Palace looked at Luotian protected by the fire sea. They continuously evolved techniques, launching them toward him.

"Roar..." A series of fire dragons roared and clashed with their techniques. Heaven and earth trembled, the void cracked—this was a battle between top-tier immortals. While Long Que protected Luotian, he also fought with Eternal Life Immortal King. Long Que's terrifying power was fully revealed.

"Why do you protect this boy? Join me, and I'll restore you to your peak. Let's achieve eternal life together!" Eternal Life Immortal King continuously attacked, each collision shaking the heavens. However, both Long Que and Eternal Life Immortal King were cautious of each other, not yet revealing their final killer moves.

"You don't have the right to interfere. I just like to meddle!" Long Que scoffed, continuing to clash with Eternal Life Immortal King.
