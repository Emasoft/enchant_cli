“What’s this kid made of?” a voice of confusion echoed in everyone’s hearts, their minds unable to fathom it. The lineage of Thick Earth, renowned for its physical strength, had actually submitted to another’s hand.

“Wang Dayong, how is it going? I told you long ago—never get too excited about anything!” Lei Yong sneered, mocking Wang Dayong.

Wang Dayong stared in disbelief at the unconscious Lang Yueping before him, his heart heavy with mixed feelings: “I never expected the Pill Hall to produce another such talent!”

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei gazed at Luo Tian. Among the Five Elements Sect, they had known Luo Tian the longest. Recalling his growth, their eyes brimmed with boundless confidence.

“Bravo! Luo Tian truly deserves my Qianxue Senior Sister’s choice. Hurry and drive out all those from Thick Earth Peak; they’ve been as annoying as flies!” Ning Qingzhu shouted without hesitation, and only after several more knocks on her head from Wang Yulan did she finally stop.

“Invincible!” The crowd collectively thought as they gazed upon Luo Tian, who stood on the arena, catching his breath.

“Who else?” Luo Tian bellowed at the sea of people below. He hadn’t wanted to act this way, but he knew only strength could make them realize their place. Otherwise, he would be plagued by endless entanglements.

Some cultivators at Body-Refining Stage Eight glanced at the unconscious Lang Yueping, their lips twitching. Though they had initially intended to test their strength, upon witnessing Luo Tian instantly incapacitate a top-ranked contender on the Earth List, they silently thanked their luck for not being the first to challenge.

Everyone could see Luo Tian was establishing his authority, instilling fear and warning those overreaching: “See? Be careful not to seek trouble!”

“I’ll take it!” A sharp voice rang out. The crowd turned toward the source, surprised to find someone still daring to challenge Luo Tian.

But upon seeing who it was, their minds cursed: “Shameless!”

Wang Dayong had already stepped onto the arena by then, a talisman pasted on his chest. People noticed his cultivation had reached Body-Refining Stage Nine.

“Damn it, Wang Dayong! Can you be any more shameless?” Lei Yong’s voice thundered toward Wang Dayong, laced with fury.

“Senior Brother Lei, Master Zhang said that the Bone-Devouring Stage can also suppress a Body-Refining Stage challenger!” Wang Dayong remained unshaken.

Seeing Wang Dayong’s shameless behavior, the crowd sneered. Even those accompanying him blushed with embarrassment for Wang Dayong.

“Spit! You, Wang—today’s incident I’ll remember. But know this: if my little brother suffers even a single hair, I’ll have you crawling back to Thick Earth Peak!” Lei Yong roared.

“Senior Brother need not worry. Though we hail from different peaks, we are still disciples of the same sect. I will exercise restraint,” Wang Dayong smiled in reply.

Luo Tian, upon seeing Wang Dayong ascend the arena, was momentarily stunned but bore no fear. His gaze merely grew more resolute: “Want me to lose face? Then show me your worth.”

“Little Brother, please be gentle!” Wang Dayong smiled at Luo Tian. Yet that smile was clearly despised by the crowd.

“Indeed, Senior Brother need not worry,” Luo Tian replied with a cold chuckle, sensing Wang Dayong’s intent.

“Hmph…” Wang Dayong was taken aback by Luo Tian’s reply. He had expected Luo Tian to be modest, given his Bone-Devouring Stage status—though his cultivation was capped at Body-Refining Stage Nine, he believed he could easily overpower Luo Tian.

The crowd cheered for Luo Tian upon hearing his confident reply, their anger at Wang Dayong’s shameless behavior palpable.

“Then Little Brother, please proceed!” Wang Dayong, still retaining some dignity, gestured for Luo Tian to strike first.

Luo Tian wasted no time. Though he was confident in his ability to match any Body-Refining Stage cultivator, he wasn’t fool enough to test his strength against a Bone-Devouring Stage opponent—such an act would be tantamount to suicide.

Luo Tian’s hands shifted rapidly. His left hand formed the Inferno Dragon Hand, while his right conjured the King’s Seal Technique toward Wang Dayong.

Seeing Luo Tian charge at him, Wang Dayong inwardly sneered: “Hmph. A Yellow-Grade Technique? How naive! Today I’ll show you the true strength of a Bone-Devouring Stage cultivator!”

Wang Dayong stood motionless, offering no defense as Luo Tian’s Inferno Dragon Hand and King’s Seal Technique struck him.

A thunderous explosion echoed. Luo Tian sighed, gazing at Wang Dayong unscathed.

“The strength of a Bone-Devouring Stage cultivator is indeed absurd. Yet even this level of defense cannot be pierced by a common Yellow-Grade Technique,” Luo Tian mused, his face finally showing concern.

“Little Brother, now it’s my turn!” Wang Dayong sneered, his voice fading as he vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

Chapter 82: The Astonishing Luo Tian

Wang Dayong wore a sneer, refraining from using any techniques. Yet his speed reached the pinnacle of Body-Refining Stage. Luo Tian felt a blur vanish before him, and without his spiritual awareness, he would have been unaware of Wang Dayong’s presence.

“Crash…” The sound of fists colliding rang out.

“Stomp, stomp, stomp…” Luo Tian was forced backward, his internal energy in disarray. If it were a regular Body-Refining Stage Nine cultivator, this punch would have sent him flying bloodied.

Wang Dayong observed Luo Tian’s retreat with a glint of concern. He had unleashed his full strength at the Body-Refining Stage, yet Luo Tian merely retreated without injury.

“Brilliant! Though restrained to Body-Refining Stage, he’s still this strong!” The crowd marveled at Wang Dayong’s might while being stunned by Luo Tian’s resilience.

“Little Brother, be cautious! I shall continue!” Wang Dayong said no more and lunged at Luo Tian again.

“Five Elements Mutual Generation, Inferno Dragon Hand!” Luo Tian roared, a fire dragon surging from his hands toward Wang Dayong.

“Trivial trick! One punch will shatter it!” Wang Dayong’s eyes narrowed as he hurled his fist toward the fire dragon.

“Roar…” The dragon howled, dissipating into the air, leaving behind a scorching heat.

“Little Brother, use whatever techniques you have! If I employ them, I concede!” Wang Dayong boasted, his body still moving forward.

Lei Yong sneered: “Wang Dayong, you truly are shameless. Who doesn’t know your Thick Earth Peak specializes in physical strength and shuns techniques? If I’m not mistaken, you likely don’t even know advanced techniques!”

“Shameless!” The crowd’s murmurs turned into mockery upon hearing Lei Yong’s words, their earlier softened attitude toward Wang Dayong now resuming scorn.

“Hmph. Then try this!” Luo Tian sneered, his body’s golden, wooden, and watery energies subtly flowing—his newly acquired Light Attribute.

A blinding light radiated from Luo Tian’s hands, illuminating the entire arena like a sun.

“What technique is this? Why can’t I see?” The crowd gasped in astonishment.

Wang Dayong, too, was blinded by the light. Especially close to Luo Tian, he felt his eyes pierced as if pricked by needles, and he quickly shut them.

“Five Elements Mutual Generation, King’s Seal Technique!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed as a seal imbued with the character “兵” (soldier) soared from his hands, descending upon Wang Dayong with terrifying pressure and crashing down.

“Crash!” A thunderous sound echoed. Wang Dayong was struck squarely, his body collapsing to the ground.

“Ah…” Wang Dayong roared, spitting blood as he rose—clearly wounded but not unconscious.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened upon seeing Wang Dayong merely injured. The surrounding disciples stared at Luo Tian in bewilderment, their understanding of his strength now profound.

“What was that white light? A technique?” One asked, noting Luo Tian’s initial flash. Though not powerful, it had momentarily stunned Wang Dayong, allowing the King’s Seal Technique to strike him unguarded.

“That was the Light Attribute!” Wang Yulan marveled, her shock at Luo Tian’s presence overwhelming. Another attribute—this was astonishing.

At that moment, several gusts of wind echoed as Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu appeared in the crowd.

“Haha, Luo Xiong, we didn’t miss a good show, did we?” Zhang Hongyun called out to Luo Tian standing on the arena.

Feng Qianyu remained silent, his eyes burning with battle intent.

Simultaneously, the prodigies from various peaks arrived at the Five Elements Arena. Luo Tian spotted many familiar faces, including Pei Letian.

“Everyone, I know you’ve come for me. But please wait until I finish this match with Senior Wang before challenging you!” Luo Tian bowed, addressing the newcomers.

“Little Brother Luo, think you can win? It won’t be easy!” Wang Dayong wiped his bloodied lips, his face dark with resentment. He had underestimated Luo Tian’s strength, and after the King’s Seal Technique’s toll, he was wounded. Now, he regarded Luo Tian with newfound respect.

Seeing Wang Dayong rise again, Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Indeed, a Bone-Devouring Stage cultivator—Luo Tian had unleashed his strongest technique, yet Wang Dayong still stood.

“Seize the moment!” Luo Tian resolved, charging toward Wang Dayong.

The onlookers marveled at Luo Tian’s audacity, cheering him on.

“Splitting Heaven Spear!”

As Luo Tian moved, a dark spear materialized in his hand. The tip pierced upward, directly aiming at Wang Dayong.

Seeing Luo Tian wield a weapon, Wang Dayong felt an ominous premonition. If he were at full strength, he wouldn’t fear Luo Tian. But now his cultivation was capped at Body-Refining Stage Nine, and he had already sustained injuries. Glancing at the silver spear tip, Wang Dayong dared not confront it directly and swiftly dodged.

“Can you dodge this?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smirk, watching Wang Dayong’s evasive movements with a cold laugh.

“Golden Snake Wild Dance!” Luo Tian sneered, his voice icy as countless spear shadows erupted from his hands, slithering like venomous snakes toward Wang Dayong.

Wang Dayong’s mind reeled. Luo Tian’s endless techniques left him overwhelmed. Sensing the cold chill of the spear, he realized evasion was futile. If struck by these shadows, he would suffer severe injuries.

Realizing this, Wang Dayong abandoned his earlier vow of no techniques and channeled his energy into forming a shield.

“Ten Directions Stone Shield!” Brown earth energy solidified, enveloping Wang Dayong.

A thunderous explosion echoed as the spear shadows rained down upon his defensive technique.

“Brilliant!” The crowd marveled at Luo Tian’s spear skills.

Chapter 83: The Final Move

Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun, witnessing Luo Tian’s dominance over Wang Dayong, felt a bitter pang. They knew they had fallen behind Luo Tian. Though confident in their own abilities, they couldn’t match his current prowess.

Pei Letian was equally stunned. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s strength to have grown so much after advancing from Body-Refining Stage Seven to Eight. Yet, a sneer returned to his face: “Even if Wang Dayong was restrained, I won’t admit defeat!”

At that moment, the arena’s thunderous sounds gradually faded. Wang Dayong panted heavily, his clothes in tatters. Luo Tian’s spear skills were too cunning; though he had defended, his strength was now less than a third of its prime.

“I concede!” Wang Dayong’s voice, barely audible from his clenched teeth, revealed his resentment. He had never imagined a Bone-Devouring Stage cultivator would be so thoroughly defeated by a Body-Refining Stage disciple. This humiliation was unbearable.

“Hiss…” A collective gasp echoed through the crowd, their respect for Luo Tian palpable. To subdue a Bone-Devouring Stage cultivator with Body-Refining Stage strength, even when restrained, was a feat worthy of being called the “Unbeatable Body-Refining Stage.”

“Did you say it’s over?” Luo Tian countered, his face darkening as he spoke softly to Wang Dayong.

Though Luo Tian’s words were quiet, the crowd—all Body-Refining Stage disciples—heard them clearly. Their faces reflected disbelief.

“What do you mean?” Wang Dayong’s face mirrored their shock, his voice instinctively questioning.

“I said… it’s not over!” Luo Tian raised the Splitting Heaven Spear, standing proudly on the arena. His voice thundered across the space.

“My heavens! Did I hear right? To subdue Wang Dayong and still claim it’s not over—does he have the strength to fight again?” One gasped.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen were equally stunned. They had thought Wang Dayong’s surrender was the best outcome, planning to settle matters later. Yet Luo Tian insisted on another fight.

“Qianxue, your man is fierce! If I weren’t this ice-cold, I might have chased after him! Be careful not to lose him!” Ning Qingzhu grabbed Gu Qianxue’s hand, marveling.

“Always so radiant,” Gu Qianxue smiled proudly at Ning Qingzhu’s words. Yet, upon hearing the latter half of her statement, she glanced around, spotting female disciples with glowing eyes toward Luo Tian. A sense of urgency stirred within her.

“Kid! What did you say?” Wang Dayong’s face contorted with rage, his fury at Luo Tian’s words reaching its peak.

“I said… it’s not over! Are you deaf?” Luo Tian repeated, then fell silent, raising the spear toward Wang Dayong.

Luo Tian knew his purpose of establishing authority over Wang Dayong was achieved. Yet, he remained unsettled. He had always believed in reciprocity—when others respected him, he returned the favor; when they insulted him, he repaid in kind. Clearly, Wang Dayong sought to humiliate his disciples, a provocation Luo Tian could not abide.

Furious energy gathered into the Splitting Heaven Spear. A terrifying aura radiated from its tip.

Wang Dayong, sensing the spear’s oppressive power, was awestruck. His current state was dire; he could not fathom Luo Tian still possessing such formidable spear skills, even more terrifying than before. One misstep could mean his injury.

Sweat dripped from Wang Dayong’s face. He knew two paths to resolve Luo Tian: one, restoring his Bone-Devouring Stage strength and ending Luo Tian with a single palm; two, employing superior techniques to subdue him.

Restoring his Bone-Devouring Stage strength was impossible—Zhang Ziping would never allow it. And with Lei Yong and Ji Chen’s presence, he could not face them.

As for the second option, while he possessed powerful techniques, his current state prevented their use.

At Wang Dayong’s desperate moment, Luo Tian’s spear aura reached its peak. The surrounding energy trembled as five golden serpents coiled and soared into the air, their mouths wide open with fangs.

“Hmph. Want to trample me? Then be ready to be crushed! Five Elements Mutual Generation, Golden Snake Wild Dance!” Luo Tian emptied his final reserves of energy, roaring.

As his voice faded, the five golden serpents shot forward like arrows toward Wang Dayong.

Seeing them approach, Wang Dayong knew he could not evade. Not even one of the serpents’ auras would be easy to handle in his current state.

Wang Dayong’s face turned pale. To restore his strength, he would have to confront Lei Yong and Ji Chen, who were already locking onto him. If he did, they would strike without hesitation, leaving him in a worse state.

He clenched his teeth, his face showing inner conflict. With a bloodied thumb, he swiftly formed hand signs.

“Haha! Wang Dayong is forced to fight back by his little brother!” Lei Yong smirked, but his aura remained locked on Wang Dayong, fearing he would restore his Bone-Devouring Stage and harm Luo Tian.

The crowd gasped at Wang Dayong’s actions. Normally, no one would resort to using blood for techniques unless desperate. Now, Wang Dayong clearly was in that state, leaving the crowd stunned.

“Ten Directions Stone Shield!” Wang Dayong roared with bloodshot eyes, summoning the same defense as before—but this time, its strength was leagues beyond the previous.

“Hmph. Fighting back?” Luo Tian, exhausted, leaned on the Splitting Heaven Spear, catching his breath as five golden serpents flew toward Wang Dayong.

Chapter 84: Unchallenged

“Woo…” The five golden serpents traversed the arena, emitting a piercing hum. They reached Wang Dayong’s front.

The serpents coiled around him without leaving a gap. Cracking sounds echoed from Wang Dayong’s body as wild energy stirred up dust, obscuring the crowd’s view.

Below the arena, people caught their breath, speechless at the depth of their awe.

“Crash!” Wang Dayong’s battered form flew from the dust, landing at the arena’s edge like a dead dog. Blood trickled from his lips; though conscious, he was weak.

Seeing Wang Dayong’s state, Lei Yong and Ji Chen felt relief. Lei Yong sighed: “After subduing Wang Dayong, who was restrained, my little brother will have it easier for the next month!”

The onlookers saw Wang Dayong lying there, his body riddled with wounds. Though the injuries were superficial, the deep purple mark across his chest—left by the Splitting Heaven Spear—was the true cause of his injury.

The crowd understood that without elixirs, Wang Dayong would not recover quickly.

At the moment he was knocked off the arena, Wang Dayong restored his Bone-Devouring Stage strength. His face bore resentment as he saw the crowd’s disdainful glances, which only deepened his pain. He spat blood again.

“Who else wishes to challenge me?” Luo Tian’s domineering voice echoed, his gaze cold as he surveyed the crowd—lingering on Pei Letian.

Pei Letian, upon witnessing Luo Tian’s final spear technique, knew he was no longer a match. Yet when he saw Luo Tian’s icy gaze, his heart chilled.

As a prodigy, had anyone ever dared to provoke him like this? He clenched his fists tightly, resisting the urge to step forward. In the end, reason prevailed; he gave Luo Tian a long look before silently turning away.

Luo Tian’s gaze drifted elsewhere, but his spiritual awareness remained fixed on Pei Letian. He noticed every expression and movement of Pei Letian. Upon seeing him turn away, Luo Tian smiled: “Finally subdued you.”

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu watched the spotlighted Luo Tian, both sighing. Though they were prodigies themselves, their time had come too early. Their brilliance was overshadowed by Luo Tian’s radiance.

“Luo Xiong, today’s battle has been enough. I’ll challenge you another day!” Zhang Hongyun bowed, his eyes burning with battle intent before leaving.

Feng Qianyu said little but nodded to Luo Tian. Yet his eyes’ fiery battle spirit was unmistakable. Under the crowd’s gaze, two prodigies of Luo Tian’s era departed.

As Pei Letian, Zhang Hongyun, and Feng Qianyu left, other prodigies realized they were no match for Luo Tian. Though reluctant, they departed for their peaks. Yet their battle spirit was fervent—Luo Tian had become their acknowledged enemy. To defeat him would mean instant fame across the Five Elements Sect.

However, prodigies were proud. After a battle, fighting again would not be at their peak. Even if they won by luck, there was nothing to boast about.

Luo Tian stood there, relieved as the prodigies left. His energy was depleted, and though he had elixirs to replenish it, his body felt exhausted. He doubted he could win another battle.

“Unexpectedly strong disciples from your sect,” a voice murmured. Ji Yunhai, observing Luo Tian standing proudly on the arena, said quietly.

Luo Tian surveyed the crowd. When his gaze fell upon Ji Yunhai, it paused. His powerful spiritual awareness allowed him to hear Ji Yunhai’s words. He wondered what the man meant, lingering his gaze slightly.

Lei Yong and others watched Luo Tian. Upon noticing his pause, they followed his gaze. Soon after, Lei Yong’s face turned pale and he gasped: “Ji Yunhai!”

Wang Yulan, hearing Lei Yong’s whisper, also stiffened. She knew of Ji Yunhai’s past—how he had kneeled before the Pill Hall for three days and nights. She also knew Ji Yunhai often troubled the new disciples of the Pill Hall.

Yet she hadn’t expected that, unlike Lei Yong and Ji Chen who challenged at the Bone-Devouring Stage, Ji Yunhai was a top three on the Heaven List. Even Lei Yong and Ji Chen would struggle against him.

“Ji Yunhai, are you here to challenge my little brother?” Lei Yong’s voice thundered toward Ji Yunhai, who appeared unassuming below the arena.

“I’m not that shameless. I wouldn’t challenge a Body-Refining Stage disciple. But I’m curious—want to see what your sect’s latest disciple is capable of. He’s impressive, truly. I won’t regret coming,” Ji Yunhai said calmly, his face expressionless. Yet when the crowd heard it was Ji Yunhai, they gasped.

The third on the Heaven List—this terrifying rank made people’s gazes toward Luo Tian shift. The top three on the Heaven List was coming to fight him.

Wang Dayong, hearing Ji Yunhai’s words, had his color return but soon flushed again. Ji Yunhai’s words clearly implied he was shameless, yet fearing Ji Yunhai’s terrifying strength, Wang Dayong bit back his anger. Under the crowd’s disdainful glances, he was assisted away by disciples.

Luo Tian heard Ji Yunhai’s words. His brow furrowed slightly. He despised such things—having done nothing to provoke anyone, yet someone sought his trouble over trivial matters.

Though Luo Tian didn’t know why Ji Yunhai wished to fight at the Bone-Devouring Stage, he was no one to be bullied. He never feared such matters.

“Count on it,” Luo Tian bowed, addressing Ji Yunhai calmly. His words held no respect for the third on the Heaven List, causing some of Ji Yunhai’s supporters to frown.

“Brave! Then I’ll take my leave!” Ji Yunhai laughed, vanishing into the crowd’s reverent gaze.

Chapter 85: Serenity

With Ji Yunhai and other prodigies departing, the match neared its end. Undoubtedly, Luo Tian’s fame within the Five Elements Sect reached its peak.

Almost every disciple in the sect took Luo Tian as their model. No one expected that this match would spark a cultivation frenzy across the sect. Even some inner disciples and direct disciples were stunned, training with renewed vigor.

Three days after his match against Wang Dayong, Zhang Hongyun challenged him. They found a secluded spot for their battle, and no one knew the result. When people saw them later, both looked battered. Neither spoke of the outcome, but Zhang Hongyun’s苦笑 hinted at it.

In the following days, inner disciples and direct disciples constantly challenged Luo Tian. Feng Qianyu was one of them. Yet those watching couldn’t find their match location. When people followed the sound of combat, they found both descending from a mountain.

Again, neither spoke of the result. Yet Feng Qianyu’s eyes burned with fiercer battle spirit, and his gaze toward Luo Tian showed deep admiration.

As Feng Qianyu departed, challenges gradually tapered off. With only six days left until the one-month period Zhang Ziping had set, it was clear.

These days, people constantly challenged Luo Tian, leaving him exhausted. Yet his cultivation and combat experience grew significantly through these relentless battles—exactly what Zhang Ziping had intended.

Yet Luo Tian was surprised by Pei Letian’s silence. He hadn’t expected this from Pei Letian, whose pride would normally not allow him to avoid a challenge.

Later, Gu Qianxue informed Luo Tian of the news. Pei Letian had finally decided to enter the Bone-Devouring Stage, and through Gu Qianxue, he told Luo Tian: “I’ll wait for you in the Bone-Devouring Stage.”

Luo Tian heard Gu Qianxue’s message but didn’t take it too seriously. He wasn’t sure how long it would take to enter the Bone-Devouring Stage, but even if he did, he was confident in defeating anyone.

In the final days, few challenged Luo Tian. He welcomed the peace, spending his time refining three elixirs daily and accompanying Gu Qianxue in her free moments. Their relationship had progressed unusually quickly, especially with Gu Qianxue spending most of her time by his side. This surprised Luo Tian.

Finally, with only one day left until the one-month period Zhang Ziping had set…

That day, Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue walked hand-in-hand along the main road of the Pill Hall. They were well-known within the Five Elements Sect, and almost everyone—including elders—knew of their relationship. These days, Luo Tian’s fame was at its peak, naturally drawing many stares.

Luo Tian held Gu Qianxue’s hand, gazing at the crowd’s reverent looks. He reflected on his transformation over the past year. A year ago, he had been an outcast expelled by the Feiyun Sect. Now, he was the most celebrated disciple in the Five Elements Sect. This journey left him speechless.

“Another month, and we’ll go to Feiyun Sect?” Gu Qianxue’s voice echoed. She was clearly uncomfortable with the crowd’s stares, her palm growing sweaty.

Feeling the dampness of her hand, Luo Tian smiled: “Yes. Only one month left!”

Luo Tian muttered to himself, gazing into the distance. His gaze now carried a cold edge.

...

Time passed swiftly to nightfall. The one-month period set by Zhang Ziping had finally ended. People, whose initial enthusiasm had waned, weren’t surprised—after all, they had witnessed the thrilling battle between Luo Tian and Wang Dayong.

Meanwhile, people held a deep disdain for Wang Dayong. This extended to other disciples of Thick Earth Peak, who also felt ashamed and resented Wang Dayong for disgracing their peak.

“Ugh. Only one month left. I should try to improve my strength a bit more, but reaching Body-Refining Stage Nine is still difficult,” Luo Tian shook his head with a bitter smile, musing over the gap between himself and Li Xiuping.

“I’m at Body-Refining Stage Eight. I can face even a Body-Refining Stage Nine without fear. But half a year ago, Li Xiuping was at Body-Refining Stage Eight. Who can say how much he’s improved in these six months?” Luo Tian mused.

Luo Tian never underestimated Li Xiuping. If someone claimed Li Xiuping was now at the Bone-Devouring Stage, he would believe it. After all, Li Xiuping had the potential.

“Ugh… I hope he doesn’t enter the Bone-Devouring Stage,” Luo Tian sighed, closing his eyes to meditate.

The next morning, Luo Tian’s courtyard welcomed an unexpected guest—Lu Kunpeng. Since the Grand Cultivation Competition, Luo Tian had immersed himself in cultivation, rarely engaging with Pill Hall affairs. Thus, his interactions with Lu Kunpeng had been minimal.

“Uncle, what’s the matter? Why have you come to visit me?” Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

“Little brat, can’t I just drop by for no reason?” Lu Kunpeng, though not disliking Luo Tian and even liking him, felt an inexplicable anger whenever he saw him.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng’s irritation, Luo Tian knew it wasn’t because of his dislike. He sighed: “Uncle, just say what you need.”

“Hmph. Good news! Old man I’ve brought a gift for you!” Lu Kunpeng sneered, pulling out a jade slip from his sleeve and tossing it to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, puzzled, caught the jade slip. His eyes widened at the five characters inscribed on it.

“Refining Soul and Body Technique!” Luo Tian whispered, his mind puzzled about what this “Qingming Refining Soul and Body Technique” truly was.

“Hey, kid. You better be happy. Do you know how many people in the Pill Hall have practiced this? Less than ten! It’s a great treasure. If it weren’t for my intercession, you wouldn’t even dream of getting it!” Lu Kunpeng boasted, stroking his beard.

Luo Tian held the jade slip in hand. His spiritual awareness, comparable to the Bone-Devouring Stage Midpoint, quickly scanned its contents. The more he read, the more astonished he became—his face was filled with shock.

“Hey kid, this suits you. If it doesn’t suit you, I wouldn’t have given it to you!” Lu Kunpeng interrupted Luo Tian’s awe.

“Thank you, Uncle!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his face sincere toward Lu Kunpeng.

Chapter 86: Refining Soul and Body Technique

“Alright, you’re now my Pill Hall’s direct disciple. If your senior brother hadn’t gone into seclusion, he might have given it to you too. I just did it a bit earlier. Remember not to spread it!” Lu Kunpeng was satisfied with Luo Tian’s attitude.

Luo Tian gazed at the jade slip, his face solemn. He nodded to Lu Kunpeng: “I will not disappoint your kindness and the elders’ trust!”

Seeing this, Lu Kunpeng nodded in satisfaction: “Good. Train well. I wonder how many levels you can reach. With your current spiritual awareness, it might again surprise us old-timers. I don’t know how you cultivated such a spiritual awareness—it’s almost as strong as mine. With this Refining Soul and Body Technique, you’ll likely be no less than me!”

Refining Soul and Body. Luo Tian learned this was an Intermediate-Level Spiritual Awareness Technique. Though his spiritual awareness was strong, who wouldn’t want it to be stronger? He had benefited greatly from its advantages—especially in increasing the success rate of elixir refinement and enhancing herbal properties. Even more, it gave him a significant edge over others in controlling techniques.

Moreover, this was an Intermediate-Level Technique. Luo Tian had never encountered one before. And with Lu Kunpeng’s seriousness, it was clearly a treasure. If it were an ordinary Intermediate-Level Technique, Lu Kunpeng wouldn’t have personally delivered it with such gravity.

Lu Kunpeng spoke a few more words, attempting to guide Luo Tian in elixir refinement. But soon realizing Luo Tian’s attention was elsewhere, he scolded and left Luo Tian’s courtyard.

After sending off Lu Kunpeng, Luo Tian sat alone on his bed, carefully studying the Refining Soul and Body Technique. The more he read, the more delighted he became. When he finally put away the jade slip, his eyes gleamed with intensity.

“This jade slip mentions that spiritual awareness is divided into seven stages: Concentrating Spirit, Forming Awareness, Refining Void, Gathering Energy, Penetrating Darkness, Boundless. Each corresponds to seven cultivation stages, also divided into early, middle, and late phases. With my current spiritual awareness comparable to the Bone-Devouring Stage Early Phase, I should be at the Forming Awareness Early Phase,” Luo Tian mused.
