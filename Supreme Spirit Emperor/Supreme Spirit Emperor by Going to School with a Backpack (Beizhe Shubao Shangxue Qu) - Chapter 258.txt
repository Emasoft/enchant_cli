If the entire Meteor Dragon Continent were likened to a dragon, then the place where Luotian and his companions currently stood would be its tail. The location of the Feathered Transformation Immortal Spring lay at the dragon's belly, and only after traversing numerous perilous regions could one reach it.

“This Feathered Transformation Immortal Spring possesses immense power. It may aid you in fulfilling another of your objectives!” The Ant Queen's eyes softened as she gazed at Luotian, her profound gaze causing his spirit to tremble.

“Another objective? That would be…” Xu Liyi's face lit up with excitement upon hearing the old woman’s words.

“The suppression of Heaven!” Diao Yuanshan's eyes also flashed with intense light, his aged gaze revealing a resolute determination.

“It seems we must visit this place regardless. I wonder how much time it will consume,” Luotian mused, his eyes filled with admiration.

“Let’s go. We must act swiftly,” Diao Yuanshan nodded to the Ant Queen, his voice resolute. No matter what, he had resolved to journey to the Feathered Transformation Immortal Spring. Not for his own detoxification, but for Luotian’s liberation from Heaven's suppression.

If Luotian’s Heavenly Suppression could indeed be lifted, his future would know no bounds. Thus, both Long Jie and Diao Yuedu would inevitably benefit. This was why Diao Yuanshan had resolved to assist Luotian, even at the cost of his life.

Luotian bowed respectfully to the Ant Queen, sensing her as a formidable figure who had aided them. The map of the Meteor Dragon Valley alone was an immense debt, for without it, they would have wandered endlessly here, wasting precious time.

Under the Ant Queen’s gentle gaze, Luotian and his companions vanished into the cave. The cavern fell silent once more.

“After the extinction of the old, when rebirth arrives, and the cycle returns, will the prophecy of our ancestors come true?” The Ant Queen’s weathered voice echoed through the cave.

Chapter 1100: Sunset Mountains

Within the Ant Clan of the Meteor Dragon Valley, Luotian and his companions followed Yan Jun’s guidance along the map toward the valley's depths. Even Diao Yuanshan at his peak had never ventured so far into the Nine Perilous Regions. Now, with Diao Yuanshan poisoned by the Queen Bee’s venom and his strength reduced to less than a third of its former self, this journey was even more perilous.

After exiting the bamboo forest, they felt as though they had stepped into another world. The bamboo grove teemed with life, while the land beyond was desolate and barren—withered trees stood in their path, accompanied by an eerie presence that seeped into their minds.

“Now I understand why the Star Dragon Ant Clan dwells within the bamboo grove. The depths of the Meteor Dragon Valley are truly this desolate!” Luotian and his companions marveled.

“I was told by the elders that the entire continent once thrived, but after the demise of the Epoch Lord, the environment gradually deteriorated. Our Star Dragon Ant Clan once spanned the entire continent, but due to environmental decay and the emergence of unknown creatures, we fell into decline. Now only a few remain,” Yan Jun said, his expression tinged with sorrow as he gazed into the distance.

“This is where the Feathered Transformation Immortal Spring lies—the heart of the continent. The nearest path requires us to traverse two perilous regions: the Sunset Mountains and the Sunset Marsh. After passing through these, we shall reach the Feathered Transformation Immortal Spring. I wonder if it still exists or has been seized by other creatures,” Yan Jun continued, pointing to a spot marked with the character for "immortal" on the map.

“Creatures?” Luotian and his companions exchanged puzzled glances, unsure of what Yan Jun meant.

“An unknown species. Their strength is formidable. Our clan’s decline was due to these creatures!”

“Observe this place—the Eye of the Dragon, the very heart of the continent—is dominated by these creatures. I suspect the Meteor Dragon Valley’s current ruinous state is due to them. They favor desolate environments, feeding on death qi. The denser the death qi, the more sacred it becomes to them,” Yan Jun explained.

“Enough of this! Tell us what these creatures look like. We can’t proceed without knowing their forms!” Xu Liyi interjected, his gaze fixed on Yan Jun.

“I don’t know their exact appearance. They are neither human nor beasts, and they feed on death qi,” Yan Jun scratched his head.

Upon hearing this, Diao Yuanshan furrowed his brow, a sense of foreboding stirring within him. His thoughts drifted to the ancient records of the Demon Realm, recalling a hidden history about the later years of the Epoch Lord.

As they spoke, they arrived at a towering mountain. Its height seemed to pierce the clouds, yet it was devoid of life—only the bones of beasts littered its slopes. If these bones had been living beings, this mountain would have been a treasure trove.

“We’ve reached the Sunset Mountains!” Yan Jun’s expression darkened as he gazed at the towering peak.

Hearing this, Luotian and his companions also grew solemn. Simply by observing the mountain’s surface, Luotian sensed its ominous nature—the thick death qi made them grimace.

“You mean we must traverse this mountain?” Xu Liyi asked, his voice laced with apprehension as he stared at the towering peak.

At this point, there was no clear path. Every direction seemed a road, for the ground bore no signs of life—only corpses.

“Let’s go. Though this is a perilous region, it isn’t the most dangerous. The true danger lies in the Sunset Marsh. I once ventured here out of curiosity as a child, but was pulled back by my kin before reaching the depths,” Yan Jun said and stepped into the mountain.

The barren rock faces exuded an eerie presence, filling the air. The four could only hear their own footsteps echoing against the towering cliffs.

“Let’s talk,” Xu Liyi said, his voice low but carrying far. A sense of unease grew stronger.

“Fine,” Luotian nodded, feeling the silence was suffocating.

“We should talk… fine…” Just as their words fell, a voice resembling an echo rose, instantly making the four tense. They could clearly sense this voice did not come from Luotian or Xu Liyi.

“Who!” Xu Liyi shouted, his voice echoing far and wide.

“Who… who…” This time, the echo repeated several times, merging into a cacophony in their ears.

The four exchanged glances and ceased speaking, scanning the surroundings. No creatures were visible.

“Could they have escaped from the Eye of the Dragon?” Yan Jun’s face paled, his voice conveying fear.

“Gurgle… gurgle…” As Yan Jun’s words faded, a series of strange cries erupted, sending an ominous chill through his mind.

“Continue forward. They’re just trying to scare us. They dare not appear!” Diao Yuanshan’s deep voice commanded as he strode ahead.

Luotian and his companions had no choice but to press on. Time was pressing, and Diao Yuanshan’s bee venom could erupt at any moment.

Time passed slowly. Luotian and his companions flew through the mountain, swiftly entering its depths within moments.

“Haha! Humans… and a little ant. Do you know where this is? You’ve trespassed on my territory! I must say, choosing the outermost region as my domain was quite wise!” As they delved tens of thousands of miles, a chilling laugh echoed into their ears.

“Finally!” Luotian and his companions halted, adjusting to their peak state as they cautiously surveyed the surroundings.

“Gurgle…” The strange cries returned, resonating like a gathering. From the grey earth and surrounding cliffs came a series of thunderous roars.

“Boom…” Suddenly, the ground cracked open, revealing a strange creature before them.

“Is this what you meant by those creatures?” Xu Liyi gazed at the creature before them, his expression awestruck.

Indeed, this being could be called a monster. Its entire body radiated no life, as if formed from death qi itself.

Hunched over, with long limbs and spines rising from its back, it crouched on the ground. Its green eyes glowed with flickering emerald flames, staring at Luotian and his companions. It clutched a white bone staff in its mouth, gnawing it with a crunching sound. Saliva dripped from its mouth, emitting an acrid stench.

“Boom… boom…” More earth cracked open as creatures identical to it emerged, some on the ground and others on the cliffs. They seemed like demons rising from hell.

“Ten… ten thousand…” As more creatures appeared before Luotian and his companions, their skin prickled with fear.

“What in the world is this!” Xu Liyi exclaimed, standing frozen as he gazed at the green eyes surrounding them.

“Rip them apart, my children!” A colossal creature atop the mountain commanded, its eyes filled with greed as it beheld Luotian and his companions like a feast.

“Roar…” The creatures, devoid of intelligence, rushed toward Luotian and his companions upon hearing their leader’s command. Their limbs flailed as they leapt before Luotian and his companions, their death qi thick and teeth bared.

“They’re not strong. We can handle them!” Luotian and his companions frowned, sensing these creatures possessed merely transcendent-level cultivation but no real threat. No need for Diao Yuanshan’s intervention; even Xu Liyi could eradicate them.

“Save your divine power. I’ll handle this!” Xu Liyi stepped forward, his hands glowing gold as he struck repeatedly. Each strike felled hundreds of creatures.

“Boom… boom…” Creatures were crushed under Xu Liyi’s hands, disintegrating into death qi and green liquid that rained from the sky.

Luotian conjured a radiant barrier to shield them from the death qi and green liquid.

“Powerful. You three are formidable among humans!” The lead creature gazed at Luotian and his companions with increasing greed.

“Years have passed since we were trapped here. We couldn’t escape for so long. How long has it been since we encountered such a feast!” The creature spoke, its voice tinged with nostalgia.

“Once I’ve finished you and your children, I’ll send you to the afterlife!” Xu Liyi continued striking, reducing each creature to a wisp of smoke.

Yet these creatures seemed boundless. New ones emerged endlessly, rushing toward Luotian and his companions with wild abandon, fearless of death.

“Are they immortal?” Luotian’s eyes flashed purple as he discerned their nature, his expression filled with awe.

Chapter 1101: Immortal Beings

Under Luotian’s violet gaze, he seemed to pierce through their essence. The creatures Xu Liyi had slain disintegrated into wisps of death qi, sinking into the earth before reforming and charging toward them again.

“This won’t work! We’ll be exhausted here!” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes widened in shock. He had never encountered such strange creatures.

Immortality, the ultimate goal of cultivation, was embodied in these beings.

“Haha! Lowly creatures. You feel it now—our immortality. No matter your skills, you cannot kill us!” The lead creature’s laughter echoed, its form gradually coalescing into a human shape. Yet it retained its monstrous traits—its fangs glinted with cold light, and the spines on its back remained.

“Luotian, think of a plan!” Xu Liyi’s eyes showed exhaustion. Though killing these creatures was effortless, they couldn’t stay here forever. If they lingered, their divine power would eventually run out.

“How long have these creatures been here? If we move forward a bit more, it’ll be our clan’s territory!” Yan Jun’s face was pale with fear.

Luotian furrowed his brow, stepping forward to stand before Xu Liyi. He extended his hand, and a surge of Dao power erupted, felling countless creatures. Simultaneously, the Dao power spread, enveloping and refining the scattered wisps of death qi.

“Roar…” The wisps emitted mournful cries before being completely refined.

“Effective?” Xu Liyi and the others’ eyes lit up. They hadn’t expected Dao power to be a weakness for these immortal beings.

Diao Yuanshan stepped forward, his hand sweeping out. A surge of three thousand Dao powers erupted, enveloping all the immortal beings in a vast expanse of purple qi. Compared to Luotian, Diao Yuanshan’s technique was far more terrifying—entire mountains were shrouded in purple light, like a massive steamer refining all the immortal beings.

“Damn it…” The lead creature’s face shifted as it observed Luotian and Diao Yuanshan. It was merely a low-level leader, its strength barely reaching the early transcendent stage. It had no chance against Luotian and his companions, but it relied on its immortality to resist.

The lead creature let out a low growl and dove into the earth, vanishing from Luotian’s sight.

After Diao Yuanshan and Luotian combined their efforts, they refined all the wisps of death qi. The mountain fell silent once more.

A field of green liquid remained, the remnants of the slain creatures. It exuded a foul stench that made Luotian’s brows furrow.

“Humans, I told you we’re immortal!” Just as Luotian and his companions relaxed, the lead creature’s voice echoed again, laced with mockery.

“Gurgle… gurgle…” As the lead creature’s words faded, the green liquid on the ground was absorbed into the earth. Moments later, the creature reappeared before Luotian and his companions.

“Still here?” Xu Liyi saw the lead creature and immediately struck, his golden hand slamming toward it.

“Boom…” The lead creature’s face contorted. In an instant, Xu Liyi’s palm crushed it. Luotian swiftly extended his hand, conjuring a Dao power symbol that coiled around the wisp of death qi.

But in an instant, the solid wisp of death qi burrowed into the earth with lightning speed.

“Boom…” The sound of earth cracking echoed again as more creatures emerged before Luotian and his companions, their expressions darkening.

“Damn it! What the hell is this thing!” Xu Liyi cursed, stunned that these creatures hadn’t died.

“I told you we’re immortal. Your methods were strong, but they only delayed us for a while!” The lead creature spoke again, commanding the creatures to charge toward Luotian and his companions. This time, it even moved forward itself.

“What do we do?” Xu Liyi and Yan Jun’s faces showed anxiety. They had no choice but to defend against the horde.

“There is no absolute in this world. These creatures are definitely not immortal. There must be a special method to counter them!”

“If we find a way to subdue these creatures, we can eradicate them completely!” Diao Yuanshan’s gaze deepened as he furrowed his brow, lost in thought.

“These creatures feed on death qi. Dao power can harm them, but it’s still insufficient. We need something extremely yang and fierce to inflict damage. I think this mountain is called the Sunset Mountains because it lacks sunlight, allowing these immortal beings to thrive!” Diao Yuanshan continued, explaining his analysis.

“Extremely yang and fierce!” Luotian furrowed his brow, muttering as he extended his hand. A碧green flame leaped from his palm, seemingly ordinary but radiating a terrifying temperature. Luotian could only think of the Heavenly Flame as something extremely yang and fierce.

“Let’s try!” Luotian had no other ideas, so he decided to test it.

“Damn it!” The lead creature, previously crushed by Xu Liyi, slowly reformed. It gazed at Luotian’s碧green琉璃fire with a terrified expression, retreating into the earth immediately.

“Effective!” Luotian saw the lead creature’s reaction and knew that碧green琉璃fire would definitely have a strong effect on these creatures.

“Fen Tian Li Huo Array!” Luotian conjured fire dragons with his hands, surrounding the entire mountain. He then slammed his hands together, igniting a sea of fire that turned the mountain green. The terrifying temperature swept through the entire mountain.

“Roar…” As the Fen Tian Li Huo Array formed, a series of roars echoed in Luotian’s ears, filling him with joy.

“I never expected the Fen Tian Li Huo Array to be effective here!” Luotian’s eyes gleamed with joy as he spoke softly.

The碧green flame, under Luotian’s control, continuously burned and refined the strange creatures. Even their peculiar green liquid was refined by the碧green琉璃fire.

“Leader of the creatures has fled! If we could capture it, we might learn much about this Meteor Dragon Valley. I have a feeling something will change here in the future. When we leave the Meteor Dragon Valley, the Star Dragon Ant Clan should also depart!” Luotian addressed Yan Jun.

“Hmph. I never expected these creatures to have reached here. If they do reach the bamboo grove, our Star Dragon Ant Clan would be in real danger!” Yan Jun nodded solemnly.

“Hum…” As Luotian and his companions spoke, the碧green flame gradually coalesced into a single fireball before returning to their front.

The once death qi-laden mountain was now dry after being cleansed by the碧green琉璃fire.

Luotian held the碧green琉璃fire in his hand, a smile on his face. But soon after, his eyes widened.

“Biyu琉璃fire! It has evolved!” Luotian’s eyes showed shock. He could sense that theBi琉璃fire had purified a fragment of consciousness.

“What?” Diao Yuanshan’s face also changed. The Heavenly Flame was a beloved child of the world, representing the pinnacle of fire. To evolve into consciousness was extremely difficult.

“I see now. It must be the immortal substance within these creatures’ bodies that was refined and absorbed by theBi琉璃fire, causing this change!” Diao Yuanshan spoke, his eyes filled with admiration.

“You’re incredibly lucky. I’ve never heard of a Heavenly Flame evolving into consciousness before. Even in the ancient records of the Demon Realm, only one Heavenly Flame was recorded to have evolved a fragment of consciousness. It’s incredibly rare!”

“An evolved Heavenly Flame with consciousness can burn anything. Even if I were caught by your flame, I would have to deal with it promptly or suffer a cost! This might be a life-saving technique for you when you reach the late transcendent stage!” Diao Yuanshan spoke softly, praising the碧green琉璃fire floating on Luotian’s hand.

As if understanding Diao Yuanshan’s praise, the碧green flame danced on Luotian’s hand, radiating a proud aura.

“Alright, let’s continue our journey!” Luotian smiled and gently waved his hand, sending theBi琉璃fire into his dantian.

“Cultivate this Bi琉璃fire carefully. If it truly evolves into a human form, it would be incredibly rare. Its strength would rival that of an Epoch Lord. In the Fire Region, there was once an Epoch Lord who cultivated a fire spirit. When this Epoch Lord returned to the void, the fire spirit became the next Epoch Lord, protecting the clan for an entire epoch before leaving!” Diao Yuanshan said with admiration, advising Luotian.

“Fire Region also had an Epoch Lord! What was that Epoch Lord’s name?” Luotian hadn’t expected the Fire Region to have an Epoch Lord.

“Seems it was the ancestor of the former Fire Region Lord, Gu Tianshu!” Diao Yuanshan replied softly, his eyes filled with sorrow. He clearly believed Gu Tianshu might revive the glory of the ancient Gu family.

Chapter 1102: Sunset Marsh

Within the Sunset Mountains, four figures darted through the terrain. With no creatures to hinder them, Luotian and his companions moved swiftly. In just three days, they exited the Sunset Mountains.

However, as soon as they stepped out of the mountains, they halted, their expressions darkening. They gazed at the scene before them.

The ground appeared ordinary, overgrown with weeds, looking like any other terrain. Yet the sight filled Luotian and his companions with a strong sense of danger.

Luotian picked up a dry branch, infused it with divine power, and hurled it toward the seemingly ordinary ground.

Before the branch could fall, the ground slowly stirred, forming a vortex. A powerful suction emerged, instantly pulling the branch into the earth.

“This…” Luotian and his companions furrowed their brows, their expressions filled with caution and fear. They couldn’t determine the vortex’s strength, but the sensation it conveyed was clearly more than just a single branch being sucked in.

“Is this a marsh?” Xu Liyi’s eyes widened with shock, his voice barely containing disbelief.

“Let me try!” Yan Jun furrowed his brow, his eyes filled with doubt as he sought Luotian’s companions’ opinions.

“I’ll go first. Watch me closely; if anything happens, pull me back!” Luotian refused to let Yan Jun take the risk and chose to test it himself.

His violet eyes凝聚, he gazed at the marsh with a strong sense of danger. He wanted to know what made this place special.

But soon, he was disappointed. He saw nothing but the swirling vortices beneath the ground. After watching for a while, his head felt dizzy, nearly causing him to fall into the marsh.

“Truly arduous,” Luotian shook his head, gazing at the endless marsh ahead with a bitter smile.

“Be grateful. We have a map and are taking the shortest route. Without it, we might not know how many perils we’d face. Even if I weren’t poisoned, I might have fallen here!” Diao Yuanshan comforted Luotian softly.

“Hmph,” Luotian nodded, slowly ascending into the sky. His expression was filled with deep caution as he gazed at the endless marsh before him, unsure where it ended.

As Luotian ascended, Diao Yuanshan, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun each sent three divine power seals to wrap around Luotian’s body, ready to act if anything happened.

Luotian nodded at them and took a cautious step onto the marsh’s surface.

“Hum…” As Luotian had taken just a few steps, the seemingly calm ground stirred again. Vortices appeared, and an irresistible suction pulled at Luotian’s body, causing him to plummet downward.

“Bad!” Diao Yuanshan and the others noticed Luotian’s distress. Their expressions changed instantly, pulling on the three seals to pull him back.

Just as Luotian was about to enter the vortex, he was barely pulled back by his companions. The four were drenched in sweat.

“Thank you for acting quickly. I can feel that if I had been sucked into the vortex, even with your pull, I would have gone in! And there was a chance it could have pulled you all in too!” Luotian said, his face filled with caution.

“Indeed, the Nine Perilous Regions of the Meteor Dragon Valley are truly dangerous. Even with a map, we’ve encountered such peril. This is the safest path we could choose!” Xu Liyi said with admiration, his voice filled with reverence.

“I wonder what dangers and opportunities lie in the heart of the Nine Perilous Regions!” Luotian said, his eyes filled with admiration.

“I’ll try,” Yan Jun furrowed his brow, gazing into the distance. His eyes were filled with contemplation before he spoke to Luotian and his companions.

“Let’s take a detour. This place is impossible to pass through!” Xu Liyi patted Yan Jun’s shoulder, shaking his head.

“Hmph. We have no choice,” Diao Yuanshan and Luotian nodded in agreement, clearly believing that only a true Epoch-level powerhouse could traverse this place with sheer strength.

“Let me try. You said we’re in a hurry, and time is short. Taking a detour might lead us to even greater dangers. Besides, I think I have some confidence!” Yan Jun scratched his head and spoke to the three.

Seeing Yan Jun’s expression, Luotian and his companions nodded. They believed Yan Jun had some confidence but found the place too dangerous. If they were careless, no one could save them.

Yan Jun saw their agreement and smiled, transforming into the size of an ant. He appeared beneath Luotian’s feet.

“What are you doing?” Xu Liyi’s eyes showed confusion, but soon he understood Yan Jun’s intention.

“Since it’s a marsh, the lighter something is, the easier it should be to cross. I won’t use my inner strength; I’ll just crawl across with my body!” Yan Jun spoke to Luotian and his companions.

“Maybe it’s feasible!” Diao Yuanshan and Luotian nodded, sending divine power to wrap around Yan Jun. Their expressions were filled with caution.

“Alright, I’m going. Remember to save me!” Yan Jun greeted them and stepped onto the marsh.

Xu Liyi and his companions watched Yan Jun closely. Their hearts were on edge as they saw him standing on the marsh. When he moved around and found no issues, they sighed in relief but still kept a close watch on his tiny form.

“I’ll increase my speed. Watch me closely!” Yan Jun instructed, moving forward without any divine power fluctuations, relying solely on his body to crawl across the marsh.

Though he relied only on his body, Yan Jun’s speed was not slow. In just a moment, he vanished from their sight.

However, with the divine power seals connected, they could still clearly sense Yan Jun’s condition and what he saw.

“Terrifying!” As Yan Jun ventured deeper into the marsh, Luotian finally witnessed its terrifying sights.

Piles of bones floated on the surface—humans and beasts alike. The bones glowed faintly with golden light, indicating their former owners were transcendent-level masters.

“Please don’t get hurt!” Xu Liyi muttered prayers, while Luotian and Diao Yuanshan tightly gripped the divine power chains. They would pull Yan Jun back immediately if anything was wrong.

“One hour… two hours…” Time passed slowly. The three’s foreheads were drenched in sweat, but they didn’t dare relax, standing like statues.

“Success!” After a full day, the three sighed in relief. Through the divine power chains, they felt Yan Jun had reached solid ground on the other side.

Yan Jun transformed back into human form, his heart still racing. He stood beside a withered tree and wrapped the divine power chains around it.

On the other side, Luotian and his companions also found a withered tree and wrapped the divine power chains around it. The marsh’s two sides were connected by three divine power chains.

“Let’s go. Remember, don’t use divine power!” Diao Yuanshan spoke first, stepping onto his divine power chain and heading toward the other side.

Luotian and Xu Liyi followed closely, carefully walking toward the opposite bank. Though they couldn’t use divine power, both were transcendent-level masters, so balance was manageable. Their speed wasn’t fast but not slow.

Luotian maintained a steady pace, gazing at the marsh. The heart-pounding sensation grew stronger as they neared the edge.

“Don’t look elsewhere, focus on the other side. Don’t look down!” Diao Yuanshan’s voice echoed in Luotian and Xu Liyi’s minds.

Time passed slowly again. After a day of walking, they had covered two-thirds of the distance. They had encountered no incidents and could already see Yan Jun, who had transformed into human form, waiting for them.

“Drip… drip…” But as both Luotian and Xu Liyi smiled, a single drop of sweat fell from Xu Liyi’s forehead onto the marsh.

Xu Liyi hadn’t thought much of it, but after walking another hour and covering the remaining distance, a series of humming sounds echoed in Luotian’s ears. At the marsh’s center, a massive vortex slowly rotated, like an enormous mouth ready to swallow everything. It gradually approached Luotian and his companions.

“Damn it! Hurry up!” Diao Yuanshan’s face changed instantly, and he quickened his pace toward the other side.

“Who the hell is this!” Xu Liyi’s face was frantic as he rushed toward the opposite bank. Yet, he still dared not use divine power, fearing another incident.

“Hum…” The humming grew louder. The vortex spread outward while the center revealed a flurry of flapping wings—dozens of mosquitoes appeared in the marsh, swirling like a typhoon toward Luotian and his companions.

“Hunmou XueXie Mosquitoes!” Yan Jun, standing on the other side, saw these mosquitoes and his expression turned terrified. He spoke in a trembling voice.

Chapter 1103: Arrival at the Destination

In the Sunset Marsh, three figures ran desperately toward the other side. Behind them, a grey vortex swept toward them.

“What in the world is this!” Xu Liyi roared, gazing at the mosquitoes behind him. Their palm-sized bodies and long proboscises made his heart pound.

“Hurry! These mosquitoes are troublesome. They feed on life essence. This marsh is their breeding ground. If they surround us, we’ll be drained to dryness in a breath!” Luotian spoke urgently. Some of the faster mosquitoes were already within ten thousand zhangs, but they seemed far away. Yet with their speed, they would reach Luotian and his companions in no time.

Time passed slowly. Luotian and his companions exerted all their strength, running toward the other side as if they had used every ounce of their power.

“Damn it! When I reach the Epoch level, I’ll destroy this cursed place. It’s too dangerous!” Xu Liyi cursed, his speed the slowest among them.

“Save your strength, kid! Even if you’re an Epoch Lord, you might still die here!” Diao Yuanshan was drenched in sweat as he spoke to Xu Liyi.

“Hum…” As time passed, the massive swarm of blood-sucking mosquitoes finally caught up with Luotian and his companions.

A palm-sized mosquito landed on Xu Liyi’s back. Its long proboscis pierced his back without resistance, drawing golden divine blood into its body.

“Damn it!” Xu Liyi struck with his hand, crushing the mosquito with his mighty physique. A large amount of divine blood spilled from Xu Liyi’s back.

“Such a quick loss of so much blood!” Luotian and Diao Yuanshan’s faces changed instantly, gazing at Xu Liyi.
