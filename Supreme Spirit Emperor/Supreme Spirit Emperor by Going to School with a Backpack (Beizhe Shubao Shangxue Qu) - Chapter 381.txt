“Boom...” Vast voids collapsed as a golden hand, radiating overwhelming might, pushed through the stars. It descended upon the ancient ten thousand clans' quasi-kings, crushing them without resistance. The stars trembled as each quasi-king was engulfed by the golden hand, their eyes filled with terror.

“Boom... Boom...” The golden hand struck the quasi-kings' bodies, scattering divine blood into the stars. Humanity's people watched with exhilaration.

“Finally, a human has achieved the power of an ancient royal clan!” The people of Jingtian Continent cheered, their eyes fixed on the horizon. Several quasi-kings wept silently.

For years, humanity had lived like slaves. Now, a single figure had ascended to become an epoch lord rivaling ancient royal clans. This meant at least two epochs of development for humanity—enough time to thrive.

“Who is this person? Who achieved such a position?” All eyes bore questions toward Jingtian.

“Damn it! How could humans have someone who ascends to kingship!” A voice echoed as several figures emerged pale-faced, their minds screaming but eyes filled with fear.

Luo Tian stared at the merged figures and the blood of unmerged quasi-kings, his mind reeling. The might of Duan Tian's master was beyond comprehension.

From Jingtian, a robust figure emerged, his presence cold and commanding. “Hail the Epoch Lord!” All humanity's people bowed, including five quasi-kings.

“Wang Duantian!” A hushed whisper spread as they recognized the figure. His name had long been forgotten, overshadowed by Qiu Tianchi's legend. Yet Wang Duantian had once lived under Qiu's protection before vanishing. Only Lu Feizhou remembered him, recalling the clash with Qiu Tianchi.

No one expected Wang Duantian—once obscure—to achieve such a feat.

“Die!” Wang Duantian sighed, then struck again. The golden hand smashed through the ancient ten thousand clans' forces, annihilating them.

“Screams echoed as the golden hand descended, its might unbearable. Clans disintegrated into dust.

The sky turned crimson as Wang Duantian's voice rang out: “Zishuang Clan, exterminated!” Humanity erupted in joy.

“Humanity rises today!” They roared into the sky, releasing years of pent-up anguish.

“Boom...” The scene ended. Luo Tian's consciousness vanished, unaware of what followed.

“Back!” He felt his body return to a grand hall instead of the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

“Human, you dare steal what I claimed!” A cold voice and battle sounds met Luo Tian's ears. He turned to see the fight.

When he saw the combatants, his eyes widened with exhilaration. His body trembled before a wave of killing intent surged from him, vanishing instantly.

Chapter 1516: Meeting Sun Mengru

“Boom...” Golden light flared as white feathers transformed into swords, forming a golden cage around the hall. Within it stood a woman in white, wielding a golden sword against cascading golden rain.

“Crash...” Golden flames coalesced into a dragon, charging the cage toward her.

“Unexpectedly encountering a human here,” Jinziyang and Fanying said, their gazes wary. “She must be an exceptional talent.”

“Die!” As they pressed, a cold voice echoed. A white light surged, striking the golden cage.

“Crack!” The cage shattered, sending waves of energy outward.

Luo Tian's speed was unparalleled. He reached the woman in an instant, crushing the golden flames with a single hand.

“Mengru, it's me!” He cradled her gently.

She stiffened before softening, the coldness vanishing as she lowered her sword. “I knew you were alive.”

“You’ve suffered,” Luo Tian murmured, releasing her to gaze at Sun Mengru’s battered form. His eyes darkened with killing intent as he faced Jinziyang and Fanying.

“Luo Tian, what do you mean? You protect this woman?” Jinziyang and Fanying frowned.

“Protect? You touched my wife!” Luo Tian’s voice was icy, filled with murder.

Though prepared for this meeting, Luo Tian still trembled with joy.

“Luo Tian, a woman is nothing in this domain,” Jinziyang sneered. “You can’t protect her.”

“Then I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian glared, his eyes narrowing at Jinziyang’s wound.

Sun Mengru stood still, her gaze soft. She knew Luo Tian would shield her. Her status as a primordial divine body allowed her to endure their attacks, still refining the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda’s mark.

She sat, beginning to refine the mark.

“Boom...” Luo Tian materialized before Jinziyang, a fist slamming into him.

“You overstep!” Jinziyang roared, his power rising.

“Crack!” Their fists collided, the hall shaking. Jinziyang was thrown back, blood spilling as he stared in shock.

Fanying struck from behind, golden light flaring. But Luo Tian barely moved, his foot kicking Fanying’s fist.

“Crack!” Fanying was hurled back, joining Jinziyang in the hall.

“Unbeatable!” Their minds reeled as their confidence crumbled.

Luo Tian lunged again, his power overwhelming. Jinziyang’s flames surged, forming golden seals.

“Boom...” The golden fists clashed again, both recoiling with cracks. Luo Tian noted Jinziyang’s strength had grown.

Fanying’s golden feathers swirled into a storm, slicing Luo Tian. Though not wounded, he was battered.

Jinziyang struck again, but Luo Tian vanished, his blade slicing Fanying.

“Break the Heavens!” Luo Tian’s white sword cut through, his divine power amplifying.

“New martial arts?” Fanying and Jinziyang marveled at his techniques.

“Nine Heavens’ Solar Flame!” Jinziyang roared, summoning nine suns that blazed the hall.

“Golden Feather Heaven-Smiting!” Fanying’s feathers coalesced into a sword.

“Sever the Heavens!” Luo Tian’s golden seal clashed with Jinziyang’s suns.

“Boom...” Explosions echoed as the hall trembled. Fanying’s sword met Luo Tian’s blade, canceling each other.

Luo Tian vanished, reappearing before Fanying. His fist, wrapped in divine power, struck Fanying’s chest.

“Puke!” Fanying spat blood, his body shattered.

“Die!” Luo Tian pressed forward.

A golden foot crushed Fanying into the floor.

“Boom...” The hall echoed as figures emerged—Fuxingyue, Fuxingyang, and Fuxingxuan.

They gaped at Luo Tian’s dominance over Fanying. Then they saw Sun Mengru, their confusion clearing.

Chapter 1517: Searching for Someone

“She’s Luo Tian’s wife? Indeed remarkable,” Fuxingyue mused, admiring Sun Mengru’s divine aura.

“But she lacks my sister’s charm,” Fuxingyang added.

Fuxingxuan compared Sun Mengru to her sister, nodding in approval.

“Hmph!” Fuxingyue’s voice trailed as they heard Fanying’s screams.

“Luo Tian grew stronger! I thought our gap would shrink,” Fuxingyue sighed.

“His strength is still top-tier in the epoch’s end,” Fuxingyang noted, guessing Luo Tian’s conflict.

“Seems we’re out of luck with the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda,” Fuxingyue muttered, sensing Sun Mengru’s mark.

“What do we do? Help?” Fuxingyue and Fuxingxuan looked to Fuxingxuan.

A golden three-legged crow erupted, its flames and claws attacking Luo Tian.

“Boom!” The flames struck Luo Tian, forcing him to retreat from Fanying.

“Even Jinziyang’s strong now,” Fuxingyue marveled, noting the crow’s lack of tail.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he clashed with the claws. The collision echoed, his fist bloodied.

“Jinziyang!” Fuxingxuan glared, rushing to attack. Her purple sword clashed with the crow.

“Crash...” Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang joined, their star-moon halberds striking.

“Star-Moon Clan! You dare side with humans?” Jinziyang roared.

“You should stay out of this,” Fanying paled, his pride wounded.

“Boom!” A halberd struck Fanying’s head, knocking him down.

“You dare?” Fuxingyue scoffed.

“Crash...” Luo Tian and others surrounded Jinziyang, golden feathers falling as the crow’s cries echoed.

Jinziyang was a prodigy, but Fuxingxuan and Fuxingyang’s combined strength overwhelmed him. With Luo Tian’s might, he was no match.

After an hour, Jinziyang fell, bloodied and defeated.

“Boom...” Jinziyang transformed back to human form, his eyes filled with hatred.

“Don’t glare. Old Crow’s friend is our clan’s elder,” Fuxingyang said, eyeing Fanying’s pitiful state.

“Seal them,” Luo Tian commanded, his hands weaving gray divine patterns. The seals bound Jinziyang and Fanying.

“Thanks,” Luo Tian smiled at the three.

“No need for thanks. Without us, they’d still be your foes,” Fuxingyue shrugged.

“Is she your wife? Indeed remarkable,” Fuxingxuan mused, gazing at Sun Mengru.

“Indeed, I love her,” Luo Tian nodded, his face flushed. He turned to Sun Mengru with regret.

“Tell us how you met?” Fuxingxuan’s purple eyes glimmered.

Luo Tian recounted his journey, from obscurity to mastery. His story stunned Fuxingyue and others, who had lived privileged lives.

“Luo Tian’s trials are unparalleled,” Fuxingyue mused, admiration in his gaze.

Fuxingxuan envied his four wives’ devotion.

“Boom...” The hall echoed as Sun Mengru opened her eyes, divine light radiating.

“Success?” Luo Tian smiled, taking her hand.

“Yes,” she nodded, a smile on her lips. She glanced at Fuxingyue’s group, her eyes narrowing.

“These are my friends from the ancient royal clans,” Luo Tian introduced.

Sun Mengru’s gaze lingered on Fuxingxuan, her breath caught by her beauty.

She turned to Luo Tian, eyes dangerous as she placed her hands on his waist.

“Hail the Master!” A voice echoed, startling them.

Three small figures burst in—Qixi, Xiaogan, and Sihun Can.

“Sihun!” Sun Mengru embraced the creature, their bond like Luo Tian and Long Baobao’s.

“Big sister, look at this robe I wove for you!” Xiaogan beamed, offering a golden feather robe.

“Xiaogan’s so kind! I love it!” Sun Mengru smiled, patting his head.

Luo Tian’s heart fluttered as Xiaogan called her “big sister.” He hoped to sway the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree.

“Master!” A gray shadow bowed, acknowledging Sun Mengru’s new role as the pagoda’s ruler.

“Mengru, can you sense the other two who entered?” Luo Tian asked, seeking Bangu and Tufei.

Chapter 1518: Guiding Light

“Humans?” Sun Mengru smiled, closing her eyes. The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda’s vision unfolded in her mind.

“No,” she finally said, shaking her head.

“No?” The group’s eyes widened. How could they not be inside?

“Their souls were severed after their thirtieth death,” the pagoda’s spirit replied.

“Then forget them. Their pride would never let them leave this domain,” Fuxingyue said, confident in their nature.

“Hmm.” Luo Tian nodded, then asked: “Where’s Qianxue?”

Sun Mengru’s eyes darkened. “Don’t panic. I’m unsure.”

“Where are they?” She asked, concern in her gaze.

“They returned to the Four Sacred Star Domains,” Luo Tian explained, then pressed: “What about Qianxue?”

Sun Mengru recounted their journey. They were transported to Xiaogan’s forest, meeting him and entering the pagoda.

They hadn’t entered immediately, sensing a pull. They found an altar, witnessing Duan Tian’s ascension.

“Ascend?” The group gasped.

“If there are immortals, Duan Tian likely ascended,” Sun Mengru said.

They explored but found nothing. Then a divine light descended, engulfing them. It wasn’t epoch power but an overwhelming presence.

They were thrust into the late epoch, but a force pulled them away. Qianxue sacrificed her strength to push Sun Mengru out, whispering: “Live, find Luo Tian, care for the children.”

“Qianxue!” Luo Tian murmured, tears welling.

“It’s not your fault,” he reassured Sun Mengru. “She would’ve done the same.”

“Did she leave any message?” Luo Tian asked, seeking clues.

“She said nothing else. The light vanished,” Sun Mengru whispered.

“We’ll go deeper. I want to see what the altar holds,” Luo Tian vowed, sensing an ominous truth.

“Let’s go.” Sun Mengru nodded, addressing Xiaogan: “Xiaogan, I must leave. Return when you can.”

“Grandpa’s gone, and now you’re leaving? What’s the point?” Xiaogan protested.

“Take him with us,” the pagoda spirit urged.

“I want to go with you, sister!” Xiaogan insisted.

“Success!” Luo Tian smiled, thrilled at obtaining the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree and pagoda.

“Too easy,” Fuxingyue muttered, envying the ease of capturing the tree.

“Let’s go.” Sun Mengru waved, transporting them outside the pagoda. The children were left behind.

“Boom...” The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda materialized as a small tower in Luo Tian’s hands. The gray mist parted, revealing the domain’s depths.

“Out!” Luo Tian smiled, though Qianxue’s absence haunted him. Yet Sun Mengru had been found, and the pagoda and tree were secured.

“Let’s go.” Luo Tian stepped into the mist, heading deeper into the domain.
