The people's eyes were vacant as they gazed upon the formidable Three-Headed Dog, their expressions filled with intense disbelief. They had never imagined that those residual souls which had once plagued them so greatly would now be devoured by this beast, vanishing almost instantly from the world.

"Damn it! What is this thing!" Qiu Jingming's face darkened as he watched the residual souls being consumed by the Three-Headed Dog, his ominous premonition growing stronger.

"Buzz..." That foreboding sense soon materialized; the residual souls imbued with a single breath of immortality, which had been under Qiu Jingming's control, trembled and gradually broke free from his grasp, converging toward the Three-Headed Dog.

"Return to me!" Qiu Jingming roared, his eyes wild with madness. This opportunity was too great to let slip through his fingers.

"Seal the Soul!" Qiu Jingming barked, his hands forming a seal as he pressed them into the void. An invisible wave radiated from him, attempting to block the residual souls imbued with immortality from flying toward the Three-Headed Dog.

"Haha! Qiu Jingming, do you think I'm just a decoration!" Luotian laughed, surprised by the Three-Headed Dog's emergence. His hands moved swiftly, breaking free from Meng Lingyun's attack and reaching toward the void.

"Buzz..." Two invisible waves collided, producing a sharp crackling sound in the sky.

Looking back at those residual souls imbued with immortality, they seemed to ignore Qiu Jingming's restraint for the first time, breaking free from his control and flying toward the Three-Headed Dog.

"Buzz..." Barely a moment passed, and the crimson battlefield returned to its red hue. Meng Lingyun and others fought fiercely, while a deep rumbling echoed from within the Three-Headed Dog's body.

Chapter 1730: Is This a Trial?

As the souls were devoured by the Three-Headed Dog, the crimson battlefield regained its red hue. Luotian's face lit up with joy; without those residual souls interfering, Jiang Nanxuan and others could now swiftly deal with the remaining resurrected prodigies.

Most importantly, Qiu Jingming's powerful aura ceased without the absorption of immortality energy, allowing Luotian a brief moment of relief. He feared Qiu Jingming might achieve enlightenment within this crimson battlefield.

Everyone was awestruck by the Three-Headed Dog's massive form.

"Dis... gone..." Du Hongxi and others trembled as they heard the deep rumbling within the black body of the Three-Headed Dog, echoing like divine music.

"What monstrous creature! So much immortality energy has been absorbed by it, yet it's unharmed!" Ma Xiuzhen stared at the Three-Headed Dog in disbelief.

"Damn it!" Qiu Jingming's face darkened as he watched his carefully laid plan crumble, the opportunity slipping from his grasp. His eyes burned with hatred toward the Three-Headed Dog.

"Beast! Give it back to me!" Qiu Jingming roared, and after remaining inactive for so long, he finally moved. His aura burst forth as he rushed toward the Three-Headed Dog.

"Roar..." The Three-Headed Dog let out a low growl, its aura overwhelming. Its three massive heads howled to the sky, their eyes filled with bloodlust as they spat out a wave of freezing cold, sweeping across the world and rushing toward Qiu Jingming.

Qiu Jingming's movements slowed instantly, that extreme cold seemingly freezing time itself and coating his body with a layer of frost.

Before Qiu Jingming could react, another wave of fire erupted from the second head, making the sky even redder. A dragon of flame roared and rushed toward Qiu Jingming with a snarl.

Ice and fire, two opposing forces, yet they clashed without conflict within the Three-Headed Dog's mouth. Two extremes of power halted Qiu Jingming, who countered with waves of gray qi.

"Excellent work!" Luotian's face lit up with joy, sensing the Three-Headed Dog had grown stronger. A force that made him feel uneasy now pulsed from its body.

"Roar..." The Three-Headed Dog let out a triumphant roar before opening its mouth again, spewing forth green toxic gas that transformed the world into a tri-color realm.

"Beast! I'll skin you and pull out your sinews!" Qiu Jingming, while resisting the extreme forces, shouted at the Three-Headed Dog with a vengeful glare.

"Ugh..." The Three-Headed Dog let out another low growl, then turned its gaze toward Meng Lingyun locked in battle with Yao Chen and others. Its silver eyes gleamed greedily before it opened its mouth again, sucking in Meng Lingyun's body.

"Buzz..." A powerful suction instantly affected Meng Lingyun, who had been suppressing Yao Chen. His massive body trembled before waves of gray qi spilled from the cracks on his body, flowing toward the Three-Headed Dog. At the same time, Meng Lingyun's aura rapidly declined.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Sensing Meng Lingyun weakening, Yao Chen and Wang Wang quickly seized the opportunity, roaring as they unleashed their strongest attacks against Meng Lingyun's body.

"Boom..." The mighty Meng Lingyun finally collapsed under their combined assault, disintegrating into waves of gray qi that drifted within everyone's sight.

On the other side, Jiang Nanxuan and others had also eliminated all the resurrected prodigies. Waves of gray qi surged again.

A swirling vortex of gray qi rose within the Three-Headed Dog's three blood-red mouths, absorbing every last bit without waste.

"Buzz..." The humming sound echoed as the Three-Headed Dog's aura surged to the heavens, its massive body jet-black. Black waves rippled across its form while it rapidly shrank, its eyes gradually closing until it transformed into a black light that landed on Luotian's wrist.

"Sleeping?" Luotian sighed deeply, gazing at the black collar-like object on his wrist with deep emotion.

"Finished. Now only that old man remains!" Luotian muttered, his eyes filled with murderous intent as he turned toward Qiu Jingming, who was still restrained by fire, ice, and poison.

"Ugh..." Others also exhaled heavily, their bodies trembling as if exhausted. Some even fell to the ground in a pitiful heap; even Jiang Nanxuan had lost his usual composure, panting heavily with disheveled clothes.

"Damned beast!" Qiu Jingming roared, his aura of gray qi surging as he broke free and stood before Luotian's group. His eyes locked onto Luotian with a deathly glare.

"Just one step closer, and I would have achieved perfection! I still have a chance; that beast has devoured so much immortality energy, it must not have fully refined it. If I kill you now, there's still a chance!" Qiu Jingming glared at Luotian, his eyes bloodshot with madness.

After speaking, nine gray soul threads shot from Qiu Jingming's hands toward Luotian.

"Buzz..." In an instant, the gray soul threads reached Luotian's front and wrapped around his body, pulling him toward Qiu Jingming.

Too fast; even Luotian hadn't reacted in time, and when he realized it, he was only dozens of feet away from Qiu Jingming.

"Die!" Qiu Jingming extended his hand, and the Divine Emperor Sword hovering above his head radiated brilliant light, slicing toward Luotian.

"Souls as blades! Cut!" Luotian's reaction was swift; a gray soul blade materialized and slashed through the soul threads. At the same time, his hands gripped the Splitting Heaven Spear, which he raised above his head.

The collision sound returned again; the gray soul blade severed the soul threads, while the Splitting Heaven Spear clashed with the Divine Emperor Sword.

"Crack..." A breaking sound echoed, and Luotian's arms instantly cracked open, golden blood gushing from his arms.

"You succeeded, but what good is it? In the end, you'll still die!" Qiu Jingming's face twisted with grotesque joy as he gazed at Luotian.

"Buzz..." Luotian pushed off the ground, his gaze now serious as he faced Qiu Jingming.

"Attack together and kill him!" Luotian whispered, then brandished the Splitting Heaven Spear, his body moving toward Qiu Jingming.

"Killing me? You're not worthy!" Qiu Jingming's face showed contempt as he brandished a golden staff in his hand, swinging it toward Luotian.

"Huh?" As Luotian moved, he felt a sinking sensation in his heart before suddenly realizing that except for Yao Chen, Wang Wang, and Run Hongyu, the others were still seated on the ground without any fighting power.

"Buzz..." The golden staff swung out, and Yao Chen's eyes were weary but his battle spirit remained undiminished. He followed Luotian, swinging the golden staff toward Qiu Jingming.

Run Hongyu's body was pierced with silver needles, his face pale; he had clearly used a secret technique. His hands moved swiftly, activating the Shura Domain's relic, the Shura Blade.

Wang Wang's aura surged into the sky as he took a step forward, extending a golden hand to push toward Qiu Jingming.

"Buzz..." After repelling Luotian, Qiu Jingming's hands moved, and the other three relics of the era also radiated brilliant light, colliding with Yao Chen's group.

The thunderous sound resounded to the heavens; the crimson sky cracked again, and Luotian's group was thrown back once more, spitting blood as they gazed at Qiu Jingming.

"Too much exhaustion; even if it's just one Qiu Jingming, it's still challenging!" Jiang Nanxuan and others wore a bitter smile as they sat under the three relics of the era. Though anxious, their previous battle had drained them greatly.

Especially Jun Wulei and Zhu Ge Qingtian, who had been relying on secret techniques to resist Meng Lingyun after Luotian retreated. Their current state was at its worst.

"That Qiu Jingming has refined so much immortality energy; his strength is nearly on par with the Era's Master. Though not as strong as Luotian's former master, it's not far off!" Jun Wulei spoke softly, his gaze on Luotian charging toward Qiu Jingming again.

"Luotian, if you can hold out for one more moment, we'll be able to recover some strength. Then we attack together; he will definitely die!" Jiang Nanxuan shouted.

"Yes, you're the man I've chosen! If you can't hold out for a moment, then you aren't a real man!" Meng Xue roared at Luotian, even as he was in battle, his lips twitched.

"Boom..." A storm of golden spear techniques rose as a golden seal descended from the sky, attacking Qiu Jingming.

"Ten Thousand Souls Devour Heaven!" Qiu Jingming fought against Luotian's group alone but showed no fear. His hands moved, and waves of gray qi erupted from his body like residual souls, constantly blocking Luotian's group's attacks while activating four powerful relics of the era to strike at them.

"Damn it, I just got rid of Meng Lingyun and now another old freak shows up!" Wang Wang was struck in the chest by the golden staff, his body collapsing into the ground.

Yao Chen and Run Hongyu were also in a pitiful state, crushed by the relics of the era. Even Luotian spat blood and nearly had his heart pierced by the Divine Emperor Sword, a hole appearing in his chest.

"In the end, it's still the same!" Qiu Jingming smiled coldly as he stood there, gazing at Luotian's group.

"One moment is hard to hold!" Luotian sighed in his heart before rushing toward Qiu Jingming again with his weary body.

"It's time to end this!" Qiu Jingming felt the state of Luotian's group and summoned a series of terrifying waves in his hands.

"One strike to eliminate all of you!" Qiu Jingming gazed at Luotian rushing toward him and the others recovering, his face filled with excitement.

"Damn it, I finally made it!"

"What? What's this? Is this the fourth trial?" As Qiu Jingming's aura grew stronger, a tall figure appeared in the crimson battlefield. He gazed at the towering column of light stretching to the heavens and spoke with a deep voice.

Chapter 1731: A Turnaround

The mighty aura surged, and terrifying waves coalesced in Qiu Jingming's hands. The chaotic energy made Luotian's face darken instantly, the immense pressure forcing him to stop his movement.

"Immortal aura! That old bastard is about to use it! He refined a lot of immortality energy; if he unleashes it, he might really destroy all of us!"

"Crack..." Three-color lightning appeared before Luotian, and the Heaven-Defying Lightning Sword reappeared in his hand.

"Give me your era power!" Luotian shouted at the group again, his gaze deep. Facing that overwhelming pressure, he could think of no other way to counter it.

"Okay..." Hearing Luotian's words, the group remembered his previous one-sword attack that had been terrifying.

"Buzz..." Thinking of this, they all rose and stood behind Luotian, their hands pressing against his back. The era power they had just recovered flowed into Luotian's body.

"Roar!" Luotian roared, his body trembling violently as waves of power radiated from him, blowing back his clothes and long hair.

Though their strength had been greatly drained, the accumulated power flowing into Luotian's body was too much for him to bear. His recovered flesh began to crack, instantly turning into a bloodied mess.

"Buzz..." Luotian desperately channeled his era power into the Heaven-Defying Lightning Sword, causing its three-color lightning to surge violently. A terrifying aura radiated from the sword again.

"Again that move!" Qiu Jingming's face was serious, but he wore a confident expression.

"Though it's strong, your group's strength is less than one-tenth of what it was!" Qiu Jingming's voice carried contempt as his aura grew stronger.

As Luotian and the others continued to gather power, the crimson battlefield became silent, with both sides staring at each other.

"Ugh... Luotian, it's not over yet?" Some people gradually became exhausted. Cao Dedu shouted loudly, feeling as if he had been drained.

"Almost there!" Luotian's eyes were bloodshot, and the Heaven-Defying Lightning Sword was finally at its critical point.

"Buzz..." Just as Luotian's Heaven-Defying Lightning Sword erupted, a buzzing sound rose from Qiu Jingming's hands.

Light scattered, and immortal aura swept across the battlefield. A golden hand formed in Qiu Jingming's hands, his face filled with excitement.

"This is the aura of immortality; this power is nearly as strong as that old bastard's palm strike!" Qiu Jingming shouted.

"Sky-Overwhelming Palm..."

"One-Sword Heaven-Defying!" Luotian and Qiu Jingming spoke at the same time, a golden hand and a green sword flying out from their hands.

Time froze; under the two terrifying martial arts, people seemed to forget to breathe, sensing that these two forces were beyond the nine regions. They pierced through the crimson sky and collided instantly.

No explosion, but an invisible wave spread outward from their collision.

"Buzz..." Several relics of the era hovered above everyone's heads, trembling gently. This was a fear that even relics of the era felt; Luotian and Qiu Jingming's attacks were enough to destroy everything.

Two martial arts clashed against each other before Luotian and the others' eyes, while invisible waves spread outward, annihilating everything. The crimson sky seemed like a calm surface that had been stirred into waves.

The Imperial Emperor Mirror, the Star Tower, and the Chaos Ancient Bell... each relic of the era radiated brilliant light, uniting to enclose Luotian's group.

"Amazing! The relics of the era have actively united!" People's faces showed shock as they gazed at the multicolored barrier above their heads, speaking in disbelief.

On the other side, Qiu Jingming's Divine Emperor Sword and four treasures also created a barrier that encased him.

Golden light filled Luotian's group's vision, constantly eroding the barrier above them, making everyone tense.

"Stay strong, ancestors!" Cao Dedu and others kept muttering, watching the relics of the era trembling under the golden light.

Time passed slowly; the golden light lasted for a moment, and the barrier above Luotian's group finally collapsed. The relics of the era dimmed and returned to their hands.

"Such a massive amount of divine power has been eroded!" Long Jie's face was pale as he gazed at the Imperial Emperor Mirror in his hand, which now looked like an ordinary mirror.

"Finally made it through!" Everyone's faces showed amazement, and they fell to the ground, panting heavily.

Then their faces turned fearful as they looked around, eyes filled with terror.

In the surrounding area of Luotian's group, a thousand miles had turned into emptiness. Yes, complete emptiness; even the crimson sky had vanished for a thousand miles.

"Cough... cough..." A low cough echoed, making Luotian's group tense again. They turned their gaze toward Qiu Jingming, who was pale-faced and clearly injured from the collision.

"Did you block it? What good is that?" Qiu Jingming's body was drenched in blood, obviously suffering from the collision. After all, he was alone and had lost two relics of the era.

"Old dog!" Seeing Qiu Jingming, Luotian's group's faces darkened. Though Qiu Jingming was in a pitiful state, he still had the strength to fight.

"Ha! You can still move now?" Qiu Jingming's eyes gleamed with excitement. Killing so many prodigies who had the potential to achieve enlightenment was a feat even the Era's Master hadn't accomplished. After all, in the Era's Master's time, there weren't so many Era's Masters' offspring.

"Die, don't choose to resurrect in Star River Academy; deal with the rest later!" Luotian felt bitter, speaking to his group. He knew this battle was a loss for them; none of them had the strength left to fight again.

"Who should I start with?" Qiu Jingming took a step forward, scanning his gaze over Luotian's group before turning it to Wang Wang.

"I'll start with you!" Qiu Jingming extended his hand, and gray soul threads shot from it, wrapping around Wang Wang's body and pulling him toward himself.

"Kid, your father once suppressed me for so long; if it weren't for my tricks, I might have died! How should I torment you?" Qiu Jingming's eyes gleamed with pleasure.

"Old bastard! One day I'll personally kill you!" Wang Wang roared, trying to break free but failing.

"Seal the Soul..." Qiu Jingming's face was cruel as he moved his hands, and soul seals flew from them, imprinting onto Wang Wang's body. Wang Wang's body instantly stiffened, his eyes filled with pain.

"Though I can't kill you, I can imprison you in Star River Academy! Let you never leave and die here!" Qiu Jingming's face was cold as he gazed at Luotian's group.

Hearing Qiu Jingming's words, Luotian's group felt a chill; if what Qiu Jingming said was true, it would be better to kill them than imprison them for so long.

"Monster!" Cao Dedu and others gritted their teeth, gazing at Qiu Jingming.

"Experience the pain I've endured for so many years!" Qiu Jingming waved his hand, tossing Wang Wang onto the ground with a dull thud before walking toward Luotian.

"Now it's your turn, kid! You've got some moves; you almost killed me. I'll take good care of you!" Qiu Jingming's face showed admiration, though his character was twisted. He couldn't help but admire Luotian's brilliance.

"If it weren't for me, you might have been very brilliant in this era. But ultimately, you'll die here in Star River Academy!" Qiu Jingming extended his hand and grabbed toward Luotian.

"Damn it!" Luotian's heart was anxious, his body roaring with a deep sound. His blood surged violently.

"It's useless; you're nothing to me now!" Qiu Jingming waved his hand, and gray rune chains flew from it, wrapping around Luotian's body.

At the moment the rune chains wrapped around him, Luotian's rising blood surged stopped instantly, leaving no chance for him to commit suicide.

"Now you have no chance to commit suicide in front of me!" Qiu Jingming's face was cold as he reached toward Luotian.

Just as Qiu Jingming's hand was about to touch Luotian, a sudden explosion echoed, and Qiu Jingming's face changed instantly. He spat out blood, his complexion pale.

"Another person has entered! Time is extended by seven days!" A cold voice echoed, the ruler of the crimson battlefield making everyone's minds pause slightly.

"Another person has entered! Who is it?" Everyone was puzzled, then saw the eight towering columns of light across the crimson battlefield shatter.

"Manhun!" Luotian's mind was puzzled for a moment before he suddenly remembered the other person who had entered Star River Academy with him. His eyes lit up with joy; he had forgotten Manhun before, but now that Star River Academy's spirit said another person had entered the crimson battlefield, he remembered there was still Manhun.

Before the towering columns of light stood a tall figure, who clapped his hands and said with disdain: "I really don't believe this thing can trap you, Manhun!"

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." After the columns of light shattered, the remaining seven towering columns across the crimson battlefield also began to break apart. The massive altar also collapsed with a thunderous sound.

Each time the altar shattered, Qiu Jingming's complexion grew paler, and he spat out mouthfuls of gray blood. His aura also became weak.

Chapter 1732: Sealing Qiu Jingming

"Another person! My soul-collecting array is destroyed!" Qiu Jingming spat out gray blood, his face showing weakness.

This soul-collecting array was a massive effort he had crafted with his own blood, closely tied to him. Now that one of them was destroyed, it had caused him great damage. Even more terrifying was the strong backlash that would follow if the soul-collecting array were destroyed.

Qiu Jingming had waited so long, delaying Sun Yuming and others to gather in the immortal tide, preventing anyone from destroying the soul-collecting array.

"Ahh..." Qiu Jingming's voice hadn't finished when the strong backlash struck his soul, making him clutch his head and howl in pain.

"Timely indeed!" Luotian's heart was excited; he hadn't expected the situation to turn around so suddenly. As a soul-sealing master, Luotian knew the terrifying nature of the soul-collecting array and understood that once it was destroyed, the backlash would be terrifying.

"Get out..." Qiu Jingming roared, feeling his soul being devoured by thousands of residual souls. Cold sweat flowed down Qiu Jingming's face.

"Luotian!" As Qiu Jingming howled in pain, the tall figure rushed over from afar. Just as Luotian had guessed, it was none other than Manhun.

"Manhun!" Others' faces also changed slightly, surprised to meet Manhun here. After all, the Man tribe was a clan of ancient kings.

"Don't be nervous; we're on the same side!" Luotian sighed deeply, gazing at Manhun's overwhelming aura with a slight smile.

After passing the first three trials, Manhun's aura had also increased significantly. Luotian knew how变态 the first three trials were.

"What's going on?" Manhun looked puzzled, gazing at Luotian, who was in a pitiful state and whose aura had weakened to the extreme.

"Don't talk nonsense; first deal with that old bastard! Remember, don't kill him yet!" Luotian looked at Qiu Jingming's painful state and spoke to Manhun. This was the perfect opportunity to eliminate Qiu Jingming, taking advantage of his weakness.

"Okay!" Manhun nodded, trusting Luotian. His gaze then turned to Qiu Jingming.

"Sun Miechen?" Manhun's mind was filled with questions; after all, Sun Miechen was also a human. Manhun didn't know why Luotian wanted him to attack Sun Miechen.

"Man's Divine Wrath Tramples the Nine Heavens!" Manhun didn't hesitate. He had no particular fondness for humans and directly unleashed the Seven Steps of Man to stomp toward Qiu Jingming.

"Boom..." At this moment, Qiu Jingming was enduring the pain of ten thousand souls devouring his soul. He had no time to care about Manhun's attack, and he was immediately crushed by a massive foot. His body collapsed onto the ground with a dull thud, emitting a series of cracks and spitting out blood like it was free.

"Man's Divine Wrath Shatters the Stars!" Manhun didn't care, his massive foot with man patterns stomped again.

Third step... fourth step... Manhun continued to take steps, each one stomping on Qiu Jingming's body.

"What a great opportunity to show off I missed!" Cao Dedu sighed deeply, gazing at Manhun's overwhelming aura as he continued to stomp on Qiu Jingming.

"Be grateful; if you want to show off, you need to survive first! If it weren't for this guy coming and accidentally breaking the soul-collecting array, we would have been in the same situation as Wang Wang!" Luotian's face showed a sigh, watching Manhun's seventh step fall and Qiu Jingming about to collapse.

Just moments ago, he had been superior, almost killing them all and imprisoning them in Star River Academy. Now, under Manhun's feet, he was barely alive, leaving people in awe.

"First, seal him!" As Manhun was about to strike again, Luotian stopped him.

"Okay!" Manhun nodded, though puzzled, he still acted. He formed a series of man patterns in his hands and took out a gray pill, pouring it into Qiu Jingming's mouth.

"Done! This will ensure he behaves himself. I've given him a curse pill, stronger than your previous Curse Pill; it will torment him day and night!" Manhun spoke to Luotian.

"Good!" Luotian sighed deeply, recalling the Man tribe's curse techniques. He felt completely drained and sat cross-legged on the ground to recover.

Others also sat cross-legged, beginning their recovery. This battle had officially ended, and Manhun stood idly in front of Luotian.

Time passed slowly; a month had slipped by without them getting up, as the battle had drained them too much.

After another seven days, Luotian slowly opened his eyes and gazed at Qiu Jingming, who was still twisted in pain.

"Rest easy; he's behaving!" Manhun spoke to Luotian, his eyes filled with confidence.

"Thank you!" Luotian's face showed a slight smile, and others also woke up, standing up to gaze at Qiu Jingming, who looked like a broken man.

"How should we deal with this old bastard?" They asked Luotian, gazing at Qiu Jingming who had almost wiped them all out.

"Seal him; don't let him go and cause trouble in the nine regions!" Cao Dedu shouted loudly, wanting to show off but fearing he might kill Qiu Jingming and let him resurrect outside Star River Academy.

"Yes, seal him!" Others also spoke, clearly terrified of Qiu Jingming to the point where they feared he might cause chaos if released.

Luotian nodded; that was why he had asked Manhun not to kill Qiu Jingming. However, after a while, Luotian felt conflicted; even the Master of the End hadn't managed to seal Qiu Jingming.

"I'll set up a great array; you all think of other methods too!" Wan Lingkong spoke, clearly confident in his array skills. However, he was now unsure about sealing Qiu Jingming due to the deep fear Qiu Jingming had instilled in them.

"Try as best as you can!" Luotian spoke softly, having no other ideas but to do his best. However, others were somewhat confident; if Qiu Jingming truly broke free in Star River Academy, their strength might increase.

After Luotian spoke, Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan began to work, their hands sending out array flags that surrounded the half-dead Qiu Jingming. A powerful sealing force enveloped his body.

Luotian and others also used their strength to seal Qiu Jingming completely.

"Boom..." Two black mountains flew from Luotian's hands, the Soul-Calling Mountain and the Magnetic Mountain. Seven-color flames flared up, melting the two black mountains together.

"Boom..." The merged black mountain crashed down, sealing Qiu Jingming's body. They then pressed more seals and sealed him again, finally calming down.

"This should be fine; with the curse power and these seals, even if he has supernatural abilities, it will take years to break free!" Luotian sighed deeply but kept Qiu Jingming's matter in mind, vowing to eliminate this threat when he was strong enough. Otherwise, this old man would always be a thorn in his heart.

"So now we should discuss the next trial!" Luotian's face then showed a slight smile, scanning his group.

After several battles, the crimson battlefield now had only about fifty people left; of those who had participated in the trials, only fifteen remained. Luotian and his group had also suffered casualties; Gu Lei and Zheng Xin had already left Star River Academy.

"Total fifty people, five hundred tokens; how to divide them?" Luotian gazed at Du Hongxi and others, intending to seek their opinions while also trying to bring them into the nine regions' ranks.

"I don't care; I saved you, so I want the inner disciple trial!" Manhun shouted loudly. Though he was just a luck-based participant, his role had been crucial, and among these people, only Luotian didn't despise him.

"Why should it be given to me? If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have made it this far!"

"It's what we fought for!" Du Hongxi and others spoke, gazing at Luotian with resentment. After all, they had aimed to become inner disciples of Star River Academy.

The group quickly started arguing; five hundred tokens could allow them all to take the outer disciple exam. The only competition was for the three inner disciple positions.

"Enough arguing!" Luotian felt a headache, then thought for a moment before speaking to the group.

"One inner disciple position for Manhun, one for Wang Xiong and Jun Xiong!" Luotian spoke to the group, waving his hand to emit an invisible wave that restored Wang Wang's consciousness.

"As for you all, we'll compensate you with a single immortal herb!" Luotian spoke to Du Hongxi and others.

"What!" Hearing Luotian's words, everyone's faces showed disbelief, gazing at Luotian.

"Immortal herb!" Du Hongxi's face changed; an immortal herb was rare even in the Immortal Realm. They hadn't expected Luotian's compensation to be so generous.

Originally, Du Hongxi and others had thought they had no say in the matter; after all, if Luotian's group united, they could have killed them. Their previous words were just a test.

The inner disciple positions were precious, but if they didn't pass, they had nothing. Compared to an immortal herb, they would choose the herb instead.

Chapter 1733: A Chance to Ascend Overnight

"Deal!" Hearing Luotian's words, Du Hongxi and others nodded in agreement, gazing at Luotian with hope.

"Of course, the value of an immortal herb is well-known to you all. You must serve our nine regions for a hundred years. After that, I'll give you the immortal herb. You can choose to refuse; if not, it's a fight to the death. Who survives and who dies is clear in your hearts!" Luotian spoke to Du Hongxi and others.

After all, they weren't friends; they had only fought together against Qiu Jingming. There was no real friendship, and giving an immortal herb was already generous on Luotian's part.

"Good... serving for a hundred years isn't much; I heard that the time in small worlds is abundant, different from the flow of time in the Immortal Realm. A hundred years is short!" Du Hongxi nodded, and Ma Xiuzhen and others also agreed. At this point, Luotian's group was stronger than them.

"Alright, since no one has any objections, this is how it's divided!" Luotian sighed deeply. Though he was reluctant, Du Hongxi and others joining would definitely be a great help to the nine regions.

"But we have one more request: let us teach that bastard a lesson!" Du Hongxi and others showed hatred, gazing at Cao Dedu, recalling the deception by Cao Dedu.
