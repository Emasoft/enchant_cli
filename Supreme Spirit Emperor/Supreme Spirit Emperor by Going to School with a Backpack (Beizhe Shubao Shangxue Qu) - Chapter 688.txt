The youth spat out a mouthful of blood, and the azure seal instantly turned crimson, as if it had absorbed his blood.

The void trembled, and the heavens roared. The pressure from the seal alone shattered the sky, revealing how formidable it would be if unleashed.

"This technique!" Luo Tian's heart trembled as he watched the youth, pale and drained of blood. Under this technique, Luo Tian felt an overwhelming sense of peril.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and a rusted broken sword materialized in his grasp, causing Mo Tian and the youth to startle.

"What kind of sword is this? So battered, can it still be used?" The youth scoffed upon seeing Luo Tian's broken sword, which seemed on the verge of shattering.

"Hmph!" Luo Tian merely sneered, and his broken sword erupted in a burst of power, darkening and radiating an ominous aura.

"Black Sword Ascends to Heaven!" Luo Tian gripped the sword and slashed downward at the descending crimson seal.

The black blade's aura crackled with thunderous sound, and though "Black Sword Ascends to Heaven" had once been Luo Tian's ultimate secret technique, it was no longer his strongest method and required less energy.

Though not his peak power, it remained formidable—especially as it was forged through the Zhu Xian Sword, amplifying its might.

The black blade's aura clashed with the crimson seal's overwhelming presence, both moving slowly yet inexorably toward each other.

Boom...

The world roared as a deafening sound echoed, and the deep blue heavens exploded in fragments. Vast void turbulence surged downward, striking Luo Tian and his companions.

Mo Tian and the youth trembled violently; the wounded youth was hurled to the ground by the void turbulence.

Boom...

The youth spat blood, yet his eyes still held awe as he gazed at Luo Tian standing in the sky. Even after his desperate effort, Luo Tian remained unscathed.

"Is he even human?" The youth's eyes reflected bitter despair, as Luo Tian's might had shattered his arrogance.

"Leave!" The youth urged Mo Tian telepathically; they could not take Luo Tian, so they had to flee or risk their lives.

"This man's strength is too great—he might even be at the late-stage Immortal King!" The youth's mind raced, his helplessness toward Luo Tian unbearable.

"Leave? You can't!" Mo Tian's voice echoed in the youth's mind, making him shudder.

A silver moon rose, its light darkening the heavens. Luo Tian furrowed his brow, trying to discern Mo Tian's intent.

Mo Tian stood beneath the silver moon, his robes fluttering in the wind. He gazed at the fallen youth and chanted hand signs, sealing him.

"Do you know why my city of Shen Gui was destroyed?" Mo Tian's face remained cold as he addressed the youth.

"You..." The youth's expression shifted abruptly, as if struck by lightning.

"Luo Tian, do me a favor—kill him!" Mo Tian didn't wait for the youth to speak, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

Chapter 2569: Hearing of Luoshengmen

"Fine," Luo Tian nodded, though he didn't understand why Mo Tian insisted. He raised his bloodstained sword and slashed toward the youth.

The crimson blade severed the youth instantly, and Luo Tian seized his soul with a hand.

"Do you have a grudge against him?" Luo Tian held the youth's soul, his gaze on Mo Tian.

"Yes, I do!" Mo Tian trembled, his eyes fixed on the youth's gray soul.

"Mo Tian, you still couldn't kill him yourself. I never thought you knew it was us who destroyed Shen Gui City. You've been patient this long—why not kill me now?" The youth's soul, knowing death was inevitable, shouted defiantly.

"Do you know how your father died? I pierced his heart with a thousand swords! And for years, you've been by my side!"

"Your mother was burned alive by me. And your wives—ah, their scents were quite pleasant!" The youth laughed, each word deepening Mo Tian's crimson eyes.

"You dare to kill me? You're too afraid! You'll never avenge yourself! In their eyes, you're just a pawn, a lowly insect!" The youth roared, his voice laced with contempt.

"Shi..." Ten-colored flames began to scorch the youth's soul, making him howl in agony.

"Luo Tian, may you die a miserable death! Even after I'm dead, you won't live long!" The youth shouted defiantly.

"I'll kill you!" Mo Tian growled, his blade slicing toward the youth's soul.

But just as the blade neared the soul, a bloodstained long sword clashed against Mo Tian's.

Crack...

Even Luo Tian took a step back, his eyes wide with surprise as he watched Mo Tian recoil.

"You can't kill him. Leave it to me!" Luo Tian addressed Mo Tian, though he didn't know why the youth had provoked him. Yet he sensed Mo Tian's hesitation earlier.

Luo Tian retrieved a jade bottle, sealed the youth's soul within it, and spat ten-colored flames into the vial.

"He'll be burned for forty-nine days until he's ash!" Luo Tian told Mo Tian, but suddenly noticed Mo Tian's eyes had turned blood-red, even his pupils now crimson.

"Mo Tian, stay calm!" Luo Tian shouted, but Mo Tian was clearly in a trance.

"I'm fine," Mo Tian murmured, his blood-red eyes locking onto Luo Tian.

"What's going on? What's this faction called? Why did you join it?" Luo Tian asked, voicing his confusion.

"If you've made a blood oath, there's no need to explain!" Luo Tian suddenly recalled how Sheng Gong Tu and others had sworn blood oaths.

"This is my illusion; nothing's wrong!"

"I don't have much time. I'll speak plainly: this faction is called Luoshengmen, a powerful force. I joined because they destroyed Shen Gui City!"

"I've climbed to the middle ranks, but the top twelve are its founders. I don't know who they are."

"I only know one: Yang Huanyu, whose status is high!"

"I can't avenge alone, so this mission was originally assigned to others. I manipulated this man here—my revenge must rely on your help!"

"Luoshengmen seems omnipotent. It certainly has the power to destroy a palace. And it's everywhere, infiltrating every corner!"

"So don't dare confront Luoshengmen head-on. If you do, even the Lunzhuan Temple might be dragged down!" Mo Tian explained what he knew.

"Luoshengmen!" Luo Tian's mind raced when Mo Tian spoke the name, recalling Jing Wu Ye, who had also claimed to be from Luoshengmen.

"Who is Jing Wu Ye? With Mo Tian's strength, he's only a mid-level member. How powerful must those twelve leaders be?"

"Yang Huanyu is trouble wherever he goes!" Luo Tian's mind churned with waves of shock.

He had always sensed Jing Wu Ye was formidable, an ancient-era powerhouse not to be trifled with. Though Luo Tian had made great progress, he still doubted if he could match those ancient beasts.

The blood-red moon gradually faded, and the surroundings of Luo Tian and Mo Tian shifted.

"Take care," Mo Tian said as the moon changed, addressing Luo Tian again.

"You're going back?" Luo Tian asked in confusion. Since the revenge for Shen Gui City was complete, Mo Tian had no reason to return—after all, Luoshengmen was dangerous.

"It's only one enemy; there are more to kill!" Mo Tian replied, his gaze on Luo Tian. The surroundings returned to normal.

"Then be careful," Luo Tian nodded, respecting Mo Tian's choice. He couldn't interfere, so he let Mo Tian leave.

Dangerous. Luo Tian knew Mo Tian's return would be a treacherous path, every moment requiring vigilance.

"Nothing's wrong," Mo Tian said before flying into the distance, vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

"What is Luoshengmen's origin?" Luo Tian muttered, tension rising as he flew toward the Lunzhuan Temple. Though he had no concrete information, he'd gained some insights.

Luo Tian needed to inform Hei Bai and Huang Que. Though his strength had improved, he still lagged far behind those peak-level masters. This time, he hadn't encountered trouble and returned smoothly to the Lunzhuan Temple. However, Hei Bai and Huang Que weren't there—they had left with Fu Xingxuan to meet the other ten palace masters, enhancing the disciples' strength.

"Must I wait? Tianyuan Sect can't afford to!" Luo Tian's mind fretted as he returned to his courtyard.

The Lunzhuan Temple had few strong figures now: Jueying Immortal King guarded it, along with two late-stage Immortal Kings and several mid-stage ones.

"Does Jueying Immortal King agree?" Luo Tian mused, deciding to consult him.

"Are you moving the Lunzhuan Disc?" Jueying Immortal King shook his head violently upon hearing Luo Tian's request, refusing outright.

"Disciple, you know the Lunzhuan Disc is vital to our temple, right? No one can use it without the Grand Master's approval!" Jueying hurriedly spoke, fearing Luo Tian might impulsively take it.

"The Grand Master's emergency requires the Disc!" Luo Tian shouted, gazing at Jueying.

Luo Tian's plan was to retrieve the Disc. He hadn't known its true nature before, but now he did—it was a world treasure with the ability to transport in large quantities.

"I know the situation, but the Disc is our temple's sacred treasure. I can't decide alone!" Jueying replied anxiously.

"How long until the Grand Master returns?" Luo Tian asked solemnly, having sent messages to Hei Bai and Huang Que without response.

"About eight days," Jueying replied, making Luo Tian slam the table: "Eight days—too long to wait!"

"Don't panic. Summon several Immortal Kings and high-level disciples. If half agree, you can take the Disc," Jueying advised.

Luo Tian looked at Jueying, his face flushed with understanding: "I'll take the responsibility!"

"Congratulations, Disciple. Your strength has improved further!"

"What responsibility are you taking?" As Luo Tian's words finished, several figures entered the hall, their eyes smiling as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Here's the situation..." Jueying explained Luo Tian's plan to take the Disc.

"What!" Upon hearing this, several Immortal Kings and high-level disciples gasped, their gazes on Luo Tian.

"Disciple, it's unwise! If you take the Disc and place it in a sect in the Immortal realm, you're just handing yourself over!" One mid-stage Immortal King shook his head.

"Disciple, think carefully! It's our temple's treasure!" Luo Tian hadn't responded yet, but the hall erupted in chaos as they spoke, making Luo Tian's head throb. He suddenly slammed the table, turning it to splinters: "As the next Grand Master, I demand to use the Disc. If anyone disagrees, let them confront me when the Grand Master returns!"

Luo Tian didn't know why, but Mo Tian's words about Luoshengmen's omnipresence made him suspect everyone.

"Disciple, you're disrespecting us!" Luo Tian strode toward the hall's exit but was blocked by a figure.

"Let the Immortal King move!" Luo Tian's face darkened. Tianyuan Sect awaited him for salvation, and the Lunzhuan Temple's smooth entry into the Immortal realm relied on Tianyuan Sect's tolerance. If they moved Tianyuan Sect entirely, the Lunzhuan Temple's strength would be unimaginable.

"Disciple, let the Grand Master return first!" The Immortal King spoke, his eyes smiling. Others also blocked Luo Tian.

"You can't stop me—neither can Jueying Immortal King!" Luo Tian stepped forward, grabbing the elder's wrist and forcing him aside.

Chapter 2570: Resistance

The hall's atmosphere turned heavy as everyone gazed at Luo Tian.

"Someone here has hostility toward me," Luo Tian thought, observing their gazes.

"Why would they?" Luo Tian was puzzled. Though he'd had conflicts with these Immortal Kings before, those were resolved after his success in the Ten Palaces' competition. Even Yu Tian had reconciled with him.

"Could it be..." Luo Tian's mind entertained a suspicion but remained uncertain.

Luo Tian strode toward the hall's exit, but the Immortal Kings couldn't let him take the Disc so openly.

"Disciple, forgive us!" They grabbed Luo Tian, but he coldly replied: "Don't provoke me!"

"Disciple, this requires long-term planning!" Two mid-stage Immortal Kings flew up to block his path.

"Seems I must force my way!" Luo Tian sneered, unimpressed by the mid-stage Immortal Kings. They were Lunzhuan Temple members; he knew their strength well.

Luo Tian's form flickered, and his domain expanded instantly, engulfing them. The immense pressure made their faces pale.

"Nine thousand zhang! Disciple is nearing the late-stage!" They gasped upon sensing his domain.

The two mid-stage Immortal Kings blocking Luo Tian's path broke out in sweat, their gazes on him. His domain was beyond ordinary strength; Luo Tian now surpassed most mid-stage Immortal Kings in every aspect.

"You're not my match unless you use combined techniques!" Luo Tian waved his hand, a storm sweeping the two mid-stage Immortal Kings away.

His dominance was undeniable; Luo Tian had become a top-tier powerhouse, no longer needing to cower. Unless facing peak Immortal Kings, he had no fear of late-stage ones.

Luo Tian strode toward the black hall determinedly, regardless of anything—today he would take the Disc. It was a matter of life and death for hundreds of thousands of Tianyuan Sect members in the Immortal realm.

Buzz...

Jueying finally moved, a gust of wind signaling an invisible domain colliding with Luo Tian's轮回域 (Lunzhuan Domain).

"Luo Tian!" Jueying materialized before him, his gaze filled with admiration.

"Grand Master, you truly intend to block me?" Luo Tian frowned; Jueying's strength was clear—third in the Lunzhuan Temple after Hei Bai and Huang Que.

"What's happening?" As they faced off, Lunzhuan disciples gathered around Luo Tian and the Immortal Kings, their eyes filled with confusion.

"Why is the Disciple confronting several Grand Masters?" The disciples gazed at Luo Tian standing in the center.

At this moment, they surrounded Luo Tian, who stood at the core, his gaze on Jueying.

"Why do you want to take the Disc?" Jueying asked, making the disciples realize the situation.

"The Disciple wants to take the Disc? What for? It's our temple's sacred treasure!" They murmured, but Luo Tian and the others were high-ranking figures they couldn't interfere with.

"It's of great use!" Luo Tian spoke, his lips moving as he conveyed the plan to Jueying through telepathy.

"What?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's plan, Jueying's body slightly trembled. If true, it would be a great boon for the Lunzhuan Temple and a massive advantage in attacking the Immortal realm.

But this matter was too significant; world treasures were rare, and the Lunzhuan Temple had only one. Thus, Jueying was unsure how to proceed.

"Let your strength decide it—show me you have the power to retrieve the Disc!" Jueying pondered for a while before speaking.

Hearing this, Lunzhuan disciples and other Grand Masters' faces showed shock—Luo Tian's words must have convinced Jueying.

"What's the deal?" Luo Tian smiled, knowing Jueying wouldn't refuse. If he did, it would imply Jueying had issues.

Now, besides Hei Bai, Huang Que, Fu Xingxuan, and Du Jianhang, Luo Tian trusted no one in the Lunzhuan Temple.

After hearing Mo Tian's account of Luoshengmen's power, anyone could be a member. Luo Tian suspected even the Huangtian Sect Master might be one.

Even if Jueying had issues, he'd agree to let Luo Tian take the Disc. After agreeing, there might be other actions, but he wouldn't stop Luo Tian now.

As for the dangers after taking the Disc, Luo Tian no longer cared—no one could stop him with peak Immortal King strength.

"Let's test it in the Lunzhuan Array," Jueying said softly, "if you can endure one quarter of an hour within our array, I'll let you take the Disc."

The Lunzhuan disciples gasped at this. Luo Tian had witnessed the array before; when he was tested for entry, some disciples had set up the array to trap him. If not for his strength, he might have been caught.

The Lunzhuan Array was a temple array all disciples knew. When activated, it was an unstoppable self-defense tactic.

But this time was different—those disciples were only at the heavenly immortal or true immortal stage, while these Grand Masters were leagues above.

"A late-stage Immortal King, two mid-stage ones, and several early-stage ones—what a terrifying array!" The disciples marveled at the Grand Masters.

"One quarter of an hour?" Luo Tian muttered, then nodded: "Fine, let's begin!"

"You dare accept it, Disciple! Though your strength surpasses us old men, our combined array won't be easy for you to withstand!" One Grand Master spoke angrily.

Luo Tian was mocking them, having just defeated several of them in a moment, humiliating them.

"Don't talk nonsense. I'm short on time—let's start!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

"Good," Jueying's eyes showed approval, then signaled everyone to begin their hand signs.

Jueying and others chanted divine laws, powerful fluctuations gathering above Luo Tian's head, roaring as a river of energy enveloped him.

The river churned with overwhelming power, instantly crushing Luo Tian's domain, making his face shift slightly.

The heavens roared as winds and clouds swirled. As the array activated, a black vortex appeared on the dark sky, swirling and shaking the world, making the Lunzhuan disciples recoil in fear.

The array shrank to a thousand zhang, immense pressure making Luo Tian's face change. Yellow water droplets seemed to hold explosive power.

The yellow water approached Luo Tian, and before it reached him, he felt immense pressure.

In an instant, the yellow water surged toward Luo Tian, and he punched out, striking a wave.

Boom...

Luo Tian felt a mountainous force冲击 his body, shaking his blood and qi, forcing him to retreat.

Not allowing Luo Tian time to recover, another wave followed, striking his body.

Puke...

This time, Luo Tian spat blood onto the ground, making everyone gasp.

"Too strong! The Lunzhuan Array is said to be endless; once activated, it never ends. Even two attacks have made the Disciple spit blood! What about the millions to come? How will he withstand them?" The disciples murmured, watching Luo Tian get hit again.

Boom boom boom...

In an instant, four waves struck Luo Tian, making him spit blood profusely.

Luo Tian was caught off guard, never expecting the array to be this strong.

"Good thing it's not about breaking the array, but enduring a quarter of an hour!" Luo Tian thought, flying backward as he punched out with eightfold physical strength, striking the approaching wave.

This time, Luo Tian was still thrown back but not as awkwardly; he steadied himself.

"Again!" Luo Tian laughed, fighting the yellow water within the array.

The roaring continued as Luo Tian was repeatedly thrown back, blood occasionally spitting out, his body gradually accumulating wounds.

"Disciple is terrifying! He can still endure this!" The disciples marveled at Luo Tian's relentless battle against the water.

"This isn't working! Only a few tens of seconds have passed, and I'm already injured!" Luo Tian thought, discontent with his current state.

"Speed it up!" Jueying shouted, fearing Luo Tian might actually endure it.

Rippling...

The Yellow River surged faster, the array's power intensifying. A wave struck Luo Tian's chest with a crackling sound.

Cough cough...

Luo Tian spat blood, feeling his ribs about to fracture. Cracks appeared on his ribs; another hit would shatter them, putting him in danger.

"Kid, you can't endure this!" Jueying called out, hoping Luo Tian would retreat. If injured too severely, it would be bad.

"Unlikely!" Luo Tian roared, his fists forming six whirlwinds to clash with the wave.

"Sixfold轮回 (Reincarnation) — it's the Fengdu Sect!" Jueying and others gasped, surprised Luo Tian knew their secret technique.

"Speed it up!" Jueying shouted, now eager to test Luo Tian's limits.

"Golden Wheel Thunder Eye!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with divine light, gazing at the yellow water surging from all directions. He sought its weakness.

The pressure was immense, as if the yellow water flowed from nine heavens, making Luo Tian feel immediate danger.

"Looks like I have to use this move," Luo Tian sighed, grabbing the broken sword Zhu Xian in his hand.

"What is this?" Jueying and others wondered, the broken sword looking like a rusted piece of iron.

"Disciple's holding what?" The Lunzhuan disciples also wondered, thinking Luo Tian's blood sword was far better than this rusted broken blade.

As they marveled, Luo Tian finally began to wield the long sword, a blade's aura emerging from his rusted broken sword.

At that moment, Jueying and others felt the broken sword's unusual power.

In an instant, a wave struck Luo Tian, and he severed it in two, making everyone gasp.

"How is this possible? The Disciple's sword has such power—better than his blood sword!" The disciples were stunned.

As they marveled, Luo Tian's form flickered, appearing in another position and slashing a blade upwards.

Luo Tian moved like a dragon, slicing countless blades within the array.

"Speed it up!" Seeing Luo Tian counterattack, Jueying shouted. This time the array accelerated, waves crashing violently.

"Can it be? If it's strengthened further, even a late-stage Immortal King would be in danger!" Hearing Jueying's words, two Grand Masters immediately asked, as Luo Tian's life was important. If they messed up, and he was injured or killed, they'd share the blame.

"Relax. If anything goes wrong, I'll pull back and test his limits!" Jueying replied.

Luo Tian, however, seemed unaware, continuously wielding the Zhu Xian Sword within the array.

Time passed slowly; six hundred blades were unleashed, swirling above Luo Tian's head, forming an ultimate blade array.

"Finally completed!" Luo Tian felt the array's terrifying power; six hundred blades resonated, clashing with the yellow water waves.

This time, Luo Tian felt much easier, moving within the array and replenishing his blades to counter the Lunzhuan Array.

"Impossible!" Everyone gasped, even Jueying and others were stunned, gazing at Luo Tian's blade array clashing with theirs.

"What is this blade array? Even Fengdu Sect's Bountiful Heaven Array isn't this good!" Someone marveled, watching Luo Tian move his body on the ground.

"Disciple is terrifying! This blade array would kill even a late-stage Immortal King!" The disciples marveled, surprised Luo Tian had such a powerful technique.

Time passed slowly; sweat appeared on Luo Tian's forehead, as he single-handedly maintained the blade array's corner to counter Jueying and others' Lunzhuan Array. He was stretched thin, the array beginning to tremble.

But time was almost up—Luo Tian could endure half an hour, so he didn't care.

Boom boom boom...

The roaring continued as blades clashed with yellow water waves. Jueying and others' faces darkened; they couldn't contain one person, which would be a disgrace.

"Only a hundred seconds left until a quarter of an hour!" The disciples' eyes were excited, watching Luo Tian's blade array. Though it looked about to collapse, he maintained it desperately.

Luo Tian's eyes also showed a smile, his face pale from exhaustion. Both the eightfold physical strength and Zhu Xian Blade Array had drained him to a terrifying level.

Especially the Zhu Xian Blade Array, which had emptied his cultivation in a short time.

"Ten seconds... eight seconds..." As the disciples counted, the quarter of an hour was almost up.

"Done!" Luo Tian's face gradually showed a smile, exhaling deeply. He let the blade array run on its own to withstand the yellow water's冲击.

But as he relaxed, a flash of light suddenly appeared in his perception, piercing the overwhelming Lunzhuan Array.

"Who!" Luo Tian shouted, but he was already drained, lacking the strength to stand.

Chapter 2571: The Spy Within

In an instant, a flash of light moved—no one expected this sudden attack. It was timed perfectly at Luo Tian's weakest moment, when the Zhu Xian Blade Array was also vulnerable.

Luo Tian raised his hand to grab the light, but blood spurted from his palm and shoulder. The light pierced through his hand and stopped at his shoulder, rendering half his body immobile.

Boom...

At the same time, the Zhu Xian Blade Array couldn't withstand it and collapsed with a thunderous roar. The Lunzhuan Array pressed toward Luo Tian.

"Retrieve it!" Jueying's face turned pale, shouting at everyone to stop the array. If it crushed Luo Tian, he might be killed by its power!

But as Jueying stopped, someone didn't. A colossal wave surged toward the fallen Luo Tian.

"Done!" Almost instantly, Jueying saw Luo Tian being crushed by the Lunzhuan Array.

Boom boom boom...

The earth trembled as yellow water struck Luo Tian, making him feel as if hit by countless mountains.

The roaring continued, and the solid earth cracked, making the Lunzhuan disciples terrified.

"Though he endured a quarter of an hour, why did several Grand Masters and elders still activate the array to crush the Disciple?" The disciples erupted in chaos. Though it seemed slow, it was actually fast. By the time they realized, the array had already crushed Luo Tian.

"Who!" Jueying's aura turned icy instantly, his eyes blazing with fury as he gazed at the Grand Masters and elders.

"Someone wants to kill Luo Tian!" Jueying's experience told him someone within them wanted to kill Luo Tian.

The Grand Masters and elders' faces were also grim, their gazes on each other—they too knew someone wanted to kill Luo Tian.

And it wasn't just one person; at least two hadn't stopped, keeping the array running briefly.

"No signs of weakness!" Jueying observed them but found no one obviously suspicious, his face darkening.

"Check the Disciple!" Someone shouted, drawing Jueying's gaze to Luo Tian.

"Don't move!" Jueying commanded. If Luo Tian wasn't dead, he'd be very weak. If they rushed him, it would give the spy an opportunity.

"Think I'm vegetarian?" As Jueying's words finished, a cold voice echoed in everyone's ears. A flash of light rose, flying out into the dust storm toward Jueying and others.

Boom...

No one expected an attack to come at them so suddenly, and it was fast—too fast for anyone to react.

Blood spurted as the light pierced a elder's forehead, revealing it was a black nail.

The nail pierced the elder's head, drawing out something as gray mist emerged, forming the elder's soul.
