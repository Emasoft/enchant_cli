As Zhou Zhan Guang's words fell silent, the other seventeen also noticed Lu Tian encircled by a sea of people, the situation reaching its peak.

"Return and fight! Otherwise Lu Tian will be exhausted to death there! Without our interference, the remaining two Divine Clan Sage-level masters are already heading toward Lu Tian!" Zeng Tianshou's face was dark. Though their current state wasn't good, if they ignored Lu Tian completely, he would definitely perish.

"Master Demon Lord, please intervene!" Nan Gong Yuqing's face showed urgency as he addressed the Demon Lord, hoping to have Lu Tian rescued.

"Wait a little longer!" The Demon Lord's brows furrowed tightly, his gaze fixed on Lu Tian under attack, as if waiting for something.

"Who awakened us!" At the moment when everyone's eyes were fixed on Lu Tian, a heavy pressure rose from the Divine Clan's mountain, emitting withered and ancient的气息, instantly sweeping across the entire Divine Clan's mountain.

"The essence of our Divine Clan has emerged from the seal!" The disciples of the Divine Clan felt that immense power, their faces showing great joy. Even those attacking Lu Tian stopped and bowed to the ground in reverence.

"Ha! Ha!" Lu Tian coughed violently, his bloodshot eyes gradually returning to clarity. Now Lu Tian had become a spent force, unable to endure long. Seeing the countless Divine Clan disciples surrounding him without end, Lu Tian's eyes flashed with resolve—he knew this was his only chance to escape.

With the last bit of strength, Lu Tian's body surged forward toward the domain beyond.

But as he just rose, a terrifying pressure descended. A cold voice echoed across the Divine Clan's mountain: "Is it you who attacked our Divine Clan?"

The moment the voice rang out, Lu Tian's body crashed down, falling into the Divine Clan's ground.

On another side, Sun Shengtian's face was also pale to the core, having been struck down by Diao Yuanshan and causing the entire Divine Clan's mountain to tremble.

"Diao Yuanshan!" Sun Shengtian's face was filled with resentment. He had been stronger than Diao Yuanshan days ago, yet now he was beaten so wretchedly—how could Sun Shengtian bear it?

"Please, the Ancestral Lord, destroy this enemy who has invaded our clan!" Sun Shengtian knelt on the ground, his voice resounding as he stared coldly at Diao Yuanshan.

Diao Yuanshan stood in the sky, his body radiating purple aura. His gaze was deep as he looked at the Divine Clan's mountain, feeling like facing two gradually awakening monstrous beasts. His expression was extremely solemn; as a power of the Demon Domain, he naturally knew how formidable the Divine Clan's essence was.

Diao Yuanshan moved swiftly, appearing before Lu Tian in an instant. Purple Epoch power surged out, rushing into Lu Tian's body. In the blink of an eye, Lu Tian's battered body began to recover at a visible rate.

He took a long breath, his injuries gradually calming. His gaze turned to Diao Yuanshan with gratitude in his eyes.

"Wait, I'll block those two Divine Clan elders; you escape!" Diao Yuanshan's voice carried solemnity as he spoke to Lu Tian.

"Haha, Diao Yuanshan, you're overestimating yourself! Do you think you can escape before our Divine Clan's essence?" Sun Shengtian laughed, his face filled with mockery.

"Crack..." Thunderous sounds fell from the ancient void, striking the Divine Clan's mountain. Two figures slowly emerged from the mountain, like two statues without life but exuding a suffocating feeling. The domain masters observing from the sky were forced to descend to the ground under this overwhelming pressure.

"Ancestral Lord, mighty!"
"Worship the Ancestral Lord, destroy our clan's enemy!" The Divine Clan disciples and elders cheered, their eyes burning with excitement as they watched the two aged figures appear in the sky.

Golden inscriptions danced on their bodies, like chains, eventually spreading outward as streams of light descended across the entire Divine Clan's mountain.

Numerous Divine Clan disciples were enveloped in golden light, their injuries instantly healing. However, those killed by Lu Tian and the other eighteen were never to rise again.

The two elders slowly opened their eyes, lightning-like golden beams flashing from their gazes as they hurled attacks toward Lu Tian and Diao Yuanshan.

"Epoch Mid-level!" Diao Yuanshan's face showed solemnity as he raised his hands, purple Epoch power forming a barrier to block the two golden lightning bolts.

But in an instant, the two lightning bolts shattered Diao Yuanshan's defense and struck him.

"Divine Domain? The Yellows of the Demon Clan?" Two elders' eyes darkened as they gazed at Diao Yuanshan with contemplation.

"Ancestral Lord, indeed the Yellows of the Demon Clan. This person can be spared, but that youth must die—he carried an Epoch Treasure to offend our Divine Clan! And this Diao Yuanshan is his accomplice; otherwise, we wouldn't have awakened you two!" Sun Shengtian bowed respectfully to the two elders, his voice filled with reverence.

"Good! Time is short—kill them all!" The two Epoch Mid-level elders spoke softly, utterly disregarding Diao Yuanshan's origin. To them, since they had been awakened, all enemies must be eradicated to uphold the Divine Clan's dignity.

After speaking, both elders extended their hands simultaneously, massive golden hands descending like a storm toward Diao Yuanshan and Lu Tian.

"Done!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes showed a brief bitterness, but it vanished quickly. His hands moved swiftly, purple aura bursting forth as he finally凝聚 two palms to meet the elders' attack.

Lu Tian's eyes also showed sorrow—unbelievable, the Divine Clan had no fear at all and hadn't given them a chance to live.

"Forgive me, Master! Don't worry—I won't let you die!" Lu Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He stood still, his hands issuing inscriptions, but instead of forming a martial technique, he infused them into the void.

"Primordial Palace! Come!" Lu Tian roared, his gaze piercing through the void to summon the Primordial Palace to protect them.

"Boom..." At the same time, Diao Yuanshan's hands collided with the two elders' golden hands.

Thunderous explosions filled the sky, shaking the Divine Clan's mountain again. Two golden and two purple hands clashed in a cataclysmic collision, shattering the void as if splitting the heavens. The invisible waves swept over people's bodies.

"Epoch-level Mid-level masters are so terrifying! Unfortunately, Diao Yuanshan just ascended to Epoch Early and was crushed by the Divine Clan!" Yan Xiuluo and other domain masters showed intense shock, gazing at the two elders.

"Pu..." Diao Yuanshan's face turned pale, blood spewing from his mouth as his body emitted a series of cracks. He collapsed to the ground, unable to rise again.

"Master!" Lu Tian watched Diao Yuanshan for the first time seeing his formidable strength severely wounded.

"Primordial Palace, come!" Lu Tian roared with madness, his hands issuing inscriptions rapidly. His body radiated demonic energy, vanishing instantly.

"Buzz..." As Lu Tian continued to summon it, the Primordial Palace colliding with the Divine Sword suddenly sensed Lu Tian's danger. It vanished beneath the stars, descending onto the mountain's peak. Epoch power spread across the Divine Clan's mountain, causing the two elders' faces to change abruptly.

"Epoch Treasure—Primordial Palace! Who is Meng Lingyun, the Epoch Master?" The two elders gazed at the Primordial Palace hovering above Lu Tian's head, speaking in disbelief.

A clamor arose as the Divine Sword pierced through the heavens and appeared above the Divine Clan's people, following the Primordial Palace. Its sword intent was terrifying, stirring endless winds and clouds.

"Return!" The two elders narrowed their eyes, then extended their hands to stop the Divine Sword.

"Come on!" Lu Tian's face showed a hint of laughter, shouting at the two elders. His voice carried a sense of mutual destruction.

"Kid, what do you mean?" The two elders' faces darkened. Lu Tian and Diao Yuanshan were protected by the Primordial Palace, and their current strength could not move them. Unless they used Epoch Late or activated the Divine Sword—yet if they did, two Epoch Treasures colliding would have catastrophic consequences.

"Buzz..." Zeng Tianshou and the other eighteen masters also appeared before Lu Tian, returning to the Primordial Palace.

"Mutual destruction! I sacrifice my life to exchange for your entire Divine Clan's lives—I'm worth it!" Lu Tian's voice carried coldness as he gazed at the two elders.

"All Divine Clan disciples, immediately evacuate the Divine Clan's land! I'll see who can save you today! Do you think having one Epoch Treasure allows you to roam our Divine Clan?" One elder spoke, his voice filled with mockery.

Chapter 1121: Ancient Ancestor ()

On the Divine Clan's mountain, the Primordial Palace radiated golden light, protecting Lu Tian and Diao Yuanshan beneath it.

"Divine Clan disciples, now immediately evacuate the Divine Clan! I'll see if you have anything to threaten us!" One elder spoke, his voice filled with contempt.

"Yes!" The Divine Clan's people whispered, their voices respectful. They obeyed orders, each disciple rising and flying out of the Divine Clan's land.

"We should go too; the collision of Epoch Treasures is beyond our capacity!" Yan Xiuluo sighed, pulling Yan Hongtao and vanishing into the mountain as a streak of blood. They appeared instantly at the Divine Clan's domain beyond, not choosing to leave.

At the same time, Star Domain Master Zhou Tianxing and Chaos Domain Master also evacuated the Divine Clan's land with Zhou Weihe and Zhu Ge Huangchao.

"Lu Tian!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke softly, not choosing to leave but flying toward the Primordial Palace. However, he had taken a few steps when the Demon Lord forcibly pulled him back.

"South Palace! Leave with Master Demon Lord; if I die, remember to avenge me!" Lu Tian spoke to Nan Gong Yuqing.

"Go!" The Demon Lord nodded at Lu Tian. In this situation, even the Demon Lord couldn't help; two Epoch Mid-level elders were like two mountains. Plus, the Divine Clan's Epoch Treasure—Divine Sword. Unless the Demon Lord also summoned the Demon Clan's elders and Epoch Treasures, there was no chance.

The entire Divine Clan land moved under the two elders' words. Not only the Divine Clan, but other sects attending the wedding also evacuated the Divine Clan's land. After all, life was more important.

Lu Tian's face was grim as he watched the countless streaks of light around him. The mountain gradually emptied, leaving only himself and Diao Yuanshan beneath the palace, along with the two Divine Clan elders in the sky.

He had already reached his limit by summoning the Primordial Palace to protect himself. This was because he was the master of the Primordial Palace; if it were anyone else, even an Epoch Early-level master couldn't achieve this. They wouldn't be able to move the Primordial Palace at all.

"You can die!" The two Divine Clan elders smiled coldly, issuing their combined power to strike the Primordial Palace with the Divine Sword.

"Buzz..." The golden sword emitted a buzzing sound, appearing before the Primordial Palace in an instant. Golden light spread out, emitting endless brilliance as it collided with the palace.

"Crack..." Thunder flashed, violent waves instantly spread from the collision of two Epoch Treasures.

The land was overturned, and the entire Divine Clan's land, except for the mountain itself, instantly became a wasteland. The apocalypse had arrived.

The Divine Clan's mountain emitted inscriptions, wrapping it up to avoid being completely destroyed.

"Terrifying! My god, this is an Epoch Treasure—entire Divine Clan land, except for the mountain, was gone!" People outside the star domain showed fear, gazing at the Divine Clan's land destroyed by two Epoch Treasures.

Under the light of the Primordial Palace, Lu Tian's pale face showed his body breaking again, turning into a cloud of blood that churned in the light.

"Lu Tian's body was shattered! That was the reincarnation body! Even after losing most of its power, it was still shattered!" People spoke in disbelief, their eyes filled with amazement.

On the other side, Diao Yuanshan was no better—blood spewed like money from his mouth. His strong body of Epoch Early continued to crack, obviously unable to withstand another hit.

"Buzz..." Blood凝聚, Lu Tian's pale face凝聚 it, his cultivation dropped to the Sage Mid-level. His eyes showed fear.

Death—Lu Tian had experienced it countless times in the Dragon Death Valley and the Immortal Pool. This time, his body was shattered, but for Lu Tian, it wasn't much. However, he knew that if this happened again, he couldn't withstand it. He wouldn't be able to regenerate even a drop of blood—total annihilation.

"Kid, die! Don't worry, we'll follow you soon. But when we two die, we will completely eliminate the Divine Clan's future problems!" The two elders' eyes showed contempt as they spoke to Lu Tian.

"Ancestral Lord is mighty! Ancestral Lord is invincible!" The Divine Clan disciples outside the domain shouted, their voices filled with strong reverence.

"Can't do it!" Lu Tian's face showed a bitter smile, forcing the Primordial Palace to bring Diao Yuanshan into it.

" Meng Ru! Forgive me!" Lu Tian waved his hand again, summoning Sun Mengru's lifeless eyes before him.

"Lu Tian!" Seeing Lu Tian, Sun Mengru's eyes regained a glimmer of light. She flew into his arms, no longer the Divine Clan's First Ancestral Body but a delicate woman.

"Take care of yourself; this time it's my turn!" Lu Tian gently kissed her forehead, his eyes soft. Before she could speak, he also sent her into the Primordial Palace.

"No use! Even with this Epoch Treasure protecting us, we can still annihilate them!" The two elders spoke. The Divine Sword hovered above their heads, emitting an atmosphere that could annihilate everything.

The divine power was overwhelming; terrifying waves swept toward the Primordial Palace, making Lu Tian feel a sense of despair. For years, this was the first time he felt despair.

"So strong! The gap is too big!" Lu Tian sighed inwardly, gazing at the Divine Sword's golden light, feeling a sense of helplessness.

"This Primordial Palace will stay in our Divine Clan! I never expected you to be so foolish, bringing the Primordial Palace into our Divine Clan. At the cost of two Epoch Mid-level masters, we've left an Epoch Treasure behind—this awakening is truly suitable!" The two elders' eyes showed a hint of joy, gazing at the Primordial Palace above Lu Tian's head with admiration.

"I understand now. From the moment I summoned the Primordial Palace, Sun Shengtian had already targeted it. The temptation of an Epoch Treasure is too great; no sect would miss such a chance!" Lu Tian realized, gazing at the two elders.

Outside the stars, several domain masters' faces also slightly changed. The Divine Clan was already extremely powerful among the sects and clans, and adding an Epoch Treasure like the Primordial Palace would make it reach a terrifying level. If the Divine Clan had ambitions, could they withstand attacks from two Epoch Treasures?

"Two Epoch Treasures would break the balance among our sects!" Yan Xiuluo and others showed solemnity. They didn't want the Divine Clan to obtain an Epoch Treasure, but at this moment, it was in the Divine Clan. Even if their sect's elders arrived, it would be too late.

"Die! Thank you for bringing the Primordial Palace!" The two elders' eyes flashed with golden light, activating the Divine Sword to strike the Primordial Palace again.

Tremendous waves surged, terrifying sword intent sweeping across the entire Divine Clan's land, overturning it as if peeling off a layer.

"It's really over!" Lu Tian's eyes showed bitterness, gazing at the terrifying Divine Sword. He had no hope at all.

Although the Primordial Palace could block the Divine Sword's attack, he couldn't withstand the collision's aftereffects. If they collided, he would definitely die.

"A generation of prodigy, the reincarnation body who stirred nine domains—Lu Tian is about to fall!" People outside the stars sighed, gazing at the Divine Sword appearing before the Primordial Palace.

"Can't die!" Nan Gong Yuqing's eyes were bloodshot, roaring wildly. His loud voice echoed in the stars, showing his deep sorrow.

"Terrifying enemies, they have died!" Zhu Ge Huangchao and Yan Xiuluo's hearts also felt uneasy. They gazed at Lu Tian protected by the Primordial Palace with sighs.

"Haha, die! Die! Finally dead!" Some people were sad while others were happy. Those who had a grudge against Lu Tian felt infinite joy, their eyes fixed on the weak Lu Tian, wanting to witness his death.

"Two old men who dare to attack my descendants?" Just as the Divine Sword was about to touch the Primordial Palace, two fiery red hands suddenly descended from the domain beyond, crushing toward the two Divine Clan elders.

Tremendous heat ignited the entire star field, as if burning meteors, instantly breaking through the stars and appearing above the two Divine Clan elders.

At the same time, Lu Tian heard this voice, his eyes flashed with intense light, then showed disbelief. His heart was filled with excitement.

Lu Tian used his last strength to issue inscriptions,凝聚 a golden key and pushing it forward.

"Buzz..." Waves spread out; an ancient figure stood before Lu Tian, without resistance, allowing the golden key to enter his withered body.

White as snow, his withered body looked like it was about to die, but his aura was like a mountain, making people look up in awe.

His withered hands extended slowly, red light enveloping Lu Tian. At the same time, countless red inscriptions were issued by the old man,融入 into the Primordial Palace.

"Buzz..." Buzzing filled the air; golden light surged to the heavens, strange phenomena arose. Red fire oceans soared, surrounding the Primordial Palace. As the inscriptions were融入, the Primordial Palace emitted ten thousand lights, emitting divine sounds of the Dao, colliding with the Divine Sword.

"Crack..." Thunderous explosions surged, violent waves instantly spread out. Cracks suddenly rose beneath Lu Tian and the old man, spreading until the entire Divine Clan's land.

"Ancestral Lord! You succeeded!" Lu Tian's eyes showed joy, gazing at the old man before him and kneeling down.

Chapter 1122: Invincible Ancient Tian Shu ()

On the Divine Clan's mountain, Lu Tian knelt before Ancient Tian Shu, his face filled with joy. Previously, when he was in the Fire Domain, he had tried to teach Ancient Tian Shu "One Force Breaks All," hoping he would understand and break the heavenly Dao's suppression. However, Lu Tian hadn't expected success, as the heavenly Dao's suppression wasn't easy to break.

"Ah, it succeeded!" Ancient Tian Shu's face carried a faint smile, his aged eyes flashing cold light as he gazed at the two Epoch Mid-level Divine Clan elders.

"Boom..." Two fiery red hands suddenly fell, instantly appearing before the two Divine Clan elders.

"Who are you!" The two Divine Clan elders' faces changed abruptly, feeling the terrifying power of the red hands before them.

Faced with Ancient Tian Shu's powerful attack, the two elders didn't dare to be careless. Their hands glowed with golden light, forming inscriptions that ultimately凝聚, both extending their hands to collide with Ancient Tian Shu's attack.

Explosions filled the air, waves of energy surged, golden hands colliding with red hands. Terror spread across the mountain.

In an instant, the two Divine Clan elders' faces turned pale, their eyes filled with intense shock.

"Who is this old man! He's so powerful, even breaking the Divine Clan's elders!" People outside the domain showed fear, gazing at Ancient Tian Shu.

"Gu! Tian! Shu!" Yan Xiuluo's eyes showed disbelief, speaking one word at a time. His voice carried shock, as if he couldn't believe his eyes.

"What!" Hearing Yan Xiuluo's words, the crowd erupted, all eyes turning to the old man before Lu Tian.

"Gu Tian Shu! The domain master of Gu Domain, Gu Tian Shu! He was a generation's powerhouse who once dominated all nine domains' prodigies, eventually suppressed by the heavenly Dao! He's not dead!" Chaos Domain Master widened his eyes, his gaze filled with fear.

Gu Tian Shu was the nightmare of their era. Yan Xiuluo and Zhou Tianxing were from the same generation as Gu Tian Shu, even having fought against him in their youth. Yan Xiuluo had once been the disciple of the Revenant Domain, but when he tried to assassinate Gu Tian Shu, he was nearly killed by three punches.

Others had all fought against Gu Tian Shu and were crushed under his feet. In those days, Gu Tian Shu was known as the one most likely to become an Epoch Master among nine domains.

"He's still alive, and even after being suppressed by the heavenly Dao, his cultivation has reached such a terrifying level! No wonder Gu Tian Shu!" Yan Xiuluo's gaze carried nostalgia, gazing at Gu Tian Shu.

"Gu Tian Shu? I've never heard of him, but when we became famous, you were still in which place!" The two Divine Clan elders' eyes also showed amazement. They had been sealed for countless years, even knowing Meng Lingyun's existence, so they looked down on Gu Tian Shu.

"Epoch Mid-level, we are two of you. Do you think you can defeat us?" One elder spoke, his voice filled with contempt.

"Although I won't live long either, you two are even shorter-lived. Killing you is like killing a chicken!" Gu Tian Shu's voice was calm, red Epoch power swirling around his withered body. His eyes flashed confidence.

"Ancestral Lord!" Lu Tian gazed at Gu Tian Shu, he didn't understand the other words, but one sentence—'I won't live long'—was clearly engraved in his ears.

"Rest assured, I'll support you until you truly grow!" Gu Tian Shu gazed at Lu Tian, slowly moving out of the Primordial Palace's light.

"Come on! If you don't want the Divine Clan's land to be rebuilt, don't use Epoch Treasures!" Gu Tian Shu spoke to the two elders above the sky.

"We can only attack once, and we can't fight for long. However, killing you is still possible!" The two elders saw Gu Tian Shu's confidence and showed anger. According to their rank, they were much higher than Gu Tian Shu.

"Kill!" Roaring, the two Divine Clan elders soared into the sky, rushing toward Gu Tian Shu. Golden inscriptions instantly flew from their hands. One elder's hands formed a golden mountain, pressing toward Gu Tian Shu, while the other elder took out a golden sword. The sword's appearance was similar to the Divine Clan's Epoch Treasure, Divine Sword. Golden light surged, pressing toward Gu Tian Shu.

"That sword is a replica of the Divine Sword, and it was infused with waste materials from when the Divine Clan's Epoch Master forged the Divine Sword!" Someone spoke, explaining the origin of the sword in the elder's hand.

Gu Tian Shu moved swiftly, red flames instantly sweeping across the entire sky. Fire oceans surged, terrifying heat that even people outside the domain could clearly feel.

"Divine Flame!" People's eyes flashed, gazing at Gu Tian Shu. In their amazed gaze, red flames slowly凝聚 into a human-shaped illusion.

"Monstrous! Gu Tian Shu's Divine Flame has evolved to such a degree!" Yan Xiuluo spoke softly, at this moment Gu Tian Shu was too powerful.

"Even suppressed by the heavenly Dao, he's so strong. If he hadn't been suppressed by the heavenly Dao, then..." People all took a deep breath, watching red flames融入 into Gu Tian Shu's body.

"Buzz..." Buzzing sounds arose. When the red flames融入 into Gu Tian Shu's body, his entire aura changed completely. His bent figure slowly straightened, white hair rapidly fell out, black long hair grew in patches.

His appearance was as refined as jade, Gu Tian Shu had regained his youthful face. His blood and qi surged, powerful aura making the two Divine Clan elders stop their movements.

"Nine Separation Cauldron!" Gu Tian Shu spoke softly, his voice filled with excitement. A red cauldron flew from his hands toward the two Divine Clan elders.

"Nine Separation Cauldron, accompanying Gu Tian Shu throughout his battles!" Some masters who knew Gu Tian Shu showed admiration, as if seeing the once vigorous Gu Tian Shu return.

Explosions sounded, nine golden dragons flew from the Nine Separation Cauldron toward the two Divine Clan elders.

"Nine Dragons Devour Heaven, Buddha's Attack!" Gu Tian Shu, now in his youthful form, white as snow, issued inscriptions with both hands, rushing into the nine golden dragons.

"Divine Realm's Sanctuary!" The two Divine Clan elders' eyes were solemn. Though they looked down on Gu Tian Shu, they couldn't be careless about his attack. They combined their power to issue an ultimate divine technique.

Golden light flashed, enveloping the entire mountain, as if becoming a small world. The two Divine Clan elders seemed like gods descending from heaven, attacking Gu Tian Shu.

"Roar..." Enclosed in a world of their own, Gu Tian Shu showed no fear. His invincible aura spread out, driving the nine golden dragons to attack the two Epoch Mid-level Divine Clan elders.

"Gu Tian Shu, in the Divine Realm's Sanctuary, we are gods! And you are a human!" The two elders' eyes flashed golden light. Their hands surged with power, repeatedly striking the nine golden dragons. Explosions echoed constantly, making Lu Tian inside the Primordial Palace filled with shock. The collision of Epoch Mid-level battles was too terrifying; if it weren't for the Primordial Palace's protection, Lu Tian would definitely be annihilated by their aftereffects.

"Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram!" One Divine Clan elder performed the Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram, confronting the nine golden dragons. The other elder activated the Divine Sword, one hand issuing a divine seal while the other unleashed ten thousand sword beams toward Gu Tian Shu.

Both elders knew they couldn't fight for long; only by finishing quickly was it better. The longer the time, the worse it would be for them.

Gu Tian Shu furrowed his brows slightly, red Epoch power surged again. He flew into the sky alone, his fist's intent shaking the heavens. He faced the divine seal with his bare hands while the other hand manipulated the world, red flames shooting out to block the ten thousand sword beams.

"One Force Breaks All! Buddha's Attack!" Gu Tian Shu's long hair flowed, his fist striking out.

"Crack..." The fist's intent shook the heavens, red fists colliding with the divine seal. Thunderous explosions rang out again, shaking the entire Divine Clan's land, large areas of ground collapsing.

"Powerful! Gu Tian Shu, so monstrous. Only the heavenly Dao could suppress him. Unfortunately, he still has no time left; being suppressed by the heavenly Dao eroded Gu Tian Shu's life!" Yan Xiuluo and others showed shock, gazing at Gu Tian Shu who faced the two Divine Clan elders. They whispered softly.

"That's the former fire domain master, Gu Tian Shu! Invincible for an era!" People also showed reverence. Such a powerful person deserved respect.

"Gu Tian Shu!" Sun Shengtian spoke softly, then fell silent. He was a contemporary of Gu Tian Shu; they had been rivals. He was the Divine Clan's prince, full of confidence and no opponents until he met Gu Tian Shu. He lost two punches but had never accepted it over the years.

Today, Gu Tian Shu broke free from the heavenly Dao's suppression and appeared before people's eyes. This made Sun Shengtian feel extreme bitterness. The other was an Epoch Mid-level master, while he was only a step beyond Epoch.

"Our Divine Clan's Ancestral Lord is invincible!" The Divine Clan disciples and elders shouted, gazing at the two Divine Clan elders being suppressed by Gu Tian Shu. Their eyes showed disbelief.

"Boom..." The nine golden dragons pierced the heavens, striking the Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram. After Gu Tian Shu shattered the diagram with one punch, the nine heavens diagram was also scattered by the nine golden dragons.

"Roar..." Gu Tian Shu didn't hesitate; the nine golden dragons circled above his head, then rushed toward the two Divine Clan elders again.

Chapter 1123: Heaven's God Shatters Nine Heavens ()

On the Divine Clan's mountain, thunderous explosions filled the sky. The entire Divine Clan land trembled under people's shocked gazes, constantly shaking as three figures collided within a world of golden light.

The nine golden dragons were like immortal and unkillable, continuously striking the two Divine Clan elders. Gu Tian Shu was like an invincible war god, using "One Force Breaks All" combined with the Buddha's Attack technique to its peak. Each punch was a perfect strike, hitting the two elders and making them spit blood.

The Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram continuously evolved, striking Gu Tian Shu's body. Though his face was slightly pale, it had little effect.

"How strong! Where did he come from!" The two Divine Clan elders trembled in their hearts, feeling an unbearable sense of frustration. They never expected Gu Tian Shu to be so powerful. Though their blood was dry and they had sealed themselves for years, their strength was undeniable. Yet both of them couldn't defeat Gu Tian Shu with their strongest techniques.

"Invincible! At any time, Gu Tian Shu is invincible!" People outside the star domain showed shock, gazing at the fierce Gu Tian Shu.

"Oppressing our descendants, using power to suppress!" Gu Tian Shu spoke boldly, his contemptuous voice echoing in the elders' ears. He didn't regard them at all.

"Divine King!" Two Sage-level masters appeared before Sun Shengtian, their faces showing concern.

"Divine King, should we summon another Epoch Late master? Otherwise..." Three Sage-level masters showed concern, gazing at Sun Shengtian.

"Epoch Late! No, we only have three Epoch Late masters in our clan. If they are all used against Gu Tian Shu, it would be a loss!" Sun Shengtian shook his head gently and refused.

"Kill..." As people discussed, Gu Tian Shu's powerful punch finally struck one elder.

"Crack..." Golden light spread from that elder, the Divine King's Regeneration Technique activated. The elder's pale face reappeared, his cultivation hadn't dropped, but his blood and qi were much weaker.

"Can't! If we continue like this, we won't last long!" The two Divine Clan elders looked at the nine golden dragons circling around them and Gu Tian Shu, who was like a rising sun. They sent telepathic messages to each other.

"Use that move! A last-ditch effort!" They looked at each other, nodded, and showed determination.

"Sun Shengtian, today we must keep this Gu Tian Shu here; otherwise, he will be a great threat to our Divine Clan! We'll use our clan's forbidden technique. Even if we can't kill him, we'll wound him severely. You summon two more from our clan's altar to kill him!" Sun Shengtian heard the elders' thoughts, his expression changed.

"Divine Clan disciples, obey! Continue to summon our clan's elders and destroy Gu Tian Shu!" Sun Shengtian's face showed reluctance, his voice echoing in the stars.

Elders were a terrifying presence for any clan. Using one meant losing one, but using four Epoch Mid-level elders to deal with Gu Tian Shu seemed a high cost. However, Sun Shengtian couldn't refuse the elders' telepathic messages.

"The cost is too high!" Yan Xiuluo and others sighed, shaking their heads lightly.

"Haha, are you going to find two more old men? I'll kill all of your elders today!" Gu Tian Shu naturally heard Sun Shengtian's words, his face showing no fear. His confident voice echoed through the stars.

"Indeed, Gu Domain Master, this confidence is unmatched!" Diao Yuanshan appeared beside Lu Tian, his eyes filled with admiration as he gazed at the magnificent Gu Tian Shu.

"Master! How are you?" Lu Tian saw Diao Yuanshan, his face showing excitement as he asked.

"Nothing's wrong; I took two sacred herbs and should be able to fight!" Diao Yuanshan slowly walked toward the Primordial Palace's exit, wanting to help Gu Tian Shu.

"Don't! Take care of Lu Tian!" But as Diao Yuanshan took a step, Gu Tian Shu's voice rang out, his confidence evident.

"Arrogant! Though you're powerful, if we fight to the death, even if you don't die, you'll pay a heavy price. Our Divine Clan's strength is beyond your imagination!" The two elders' faces showed anger, their bodies emitting a series of thunderous sounds like mountain collapses.

"Divine God Shatters Nine Heavens!" The two Divine Clan elders' eyes showed coldness, their bodies transforming into golden dragons. They formed the Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram again but didn't launch it this time. Instead, they rushed into the diagram.

"The Divine Clan's forbidden technique—burning everything and integrating it into the Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram, absolutely crushing opponents of the same level!"
