" What we need to do is let the people of the Nine Realms find their home! " Luo Tian spoke softly. He always had a feeling that the day he would meet the people of the Nine Realms was not far off, especially after seeing this small world clash with the Celestial Realm.

The crowd fell silent. A night passed, and on the next day, Luo Tian led Diao Dezhu out of this continent. Nan Gong Yuqing and others remained here, knowing that the contest for the Heart of the World required the power of a Celestial King. They were not yet qualified.

Luo Tian had taken Diao Dezhu with him because of his unique methods and that nose, which was truly useful.

Luo Tian stood beneath the stars, feeling his power. If he wished, he could crush a star or an entire continent with just one thought.

At the center of the Star Domain, a golden vortex appeared there. The powerful suction from the golden vortex twisted the surrounding space and emitted an overwhelming pressure, with阵阵 roaring sounds rising within the vortex.

Luo Tian quickly arrived at the golden vortex that stretched for tens of thousands of feet. Within the vortex, Luo Tian felt a powerful pressure, an existence beyond the power of heaven and earth. Diao Dezhu transformed into a small purple bird, perched on Luo Tian's shoulder.

Luo Tian looked with admiration. He was now a Celestial King, but even so, he felt short of breath before the Heart of the World.

"Where are they?" Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion. He did not see anyone around the golden vortex.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian was confused, a series of roaring sounds came from the golden vortex, causing Luo Tian to take several steps back.

"This place has the aura of treasures. The golden vortex must be the one generated by the Heart of the World!" Diao Dezhu sniffed his nose.

"Master Zhang Ziping is also inside!" Diao Dezhu then trembled again, sensing the aura of Zhang Ziping.

"Be careful!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. So many people, even those who had reached the middle of Celestial King hadn't succeeded. Luo Tian was unsure if he had fallen into a trap.

Luo Tian soared upwards, rushing toward the golden vortex. No matter how strong the suction was, it pulled Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu into the golden vortex.

A humming vibration, Luo Tian felt as if he had fallen into a time vortex. The surrounding scenery twisted and was squeezed by a great force.

That power, even if Luo Tian used his domain of boundaries, could not resist it. His boundary domain was also crushed by that squeezing force.

Time slowly passed, and the squeezing force finally disappeared. Luo Tian felt his body empty, falling directly onto the ground.

Golden floor, golden walls. Luo Tian took a deep breath and slowly stood up, looking around with his eyes.

He looked at Diao Dezhu who had come in with him, then his lips twitched. Diao Dezhu was very pitiful now. That great force had made even Luo Tian uncomfortable, let alone Diao Dezhu who was only at the threshold of Celestial King.

The originally bright purple feathers had almost all disappeared. If it weren't for the unknown danger here, Luo Tian would have definitely laughed.

As Luo Tian looked at Diao Dezhu, Diao Dezhu also slowly woke up. As soon as he awoke, he felt his whole body cold and saw Luo Tian's smiling gaze. Diao Dezhu immediately had a bad feeling.

"How cold it is!" Diao Dezhu stood up and then suddenly noticed his change, letting out a scream. Purple energy flashed across his body.

"Luo Tian, you pervert! You were admiring my mighty body!" Diao Dezhu cursed, his voice filled with anger.

"Don't shout!" Luo Tian heard Diao Dezhu's shouting and quickly stopped him, making Diao Dezhu immediately shut his mouth. His purple eyes looked around.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu were paying attention to their surroundings, a thunderous sound came from the wide golden passage. The powerful fluctuation made Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu's faces slightly change.

Luo Tian reached out, grabbing the newly grown feathers of Diao Dezhu and rushing forward along the golden passage.

Within half a moment, Luo Tian's figure appeared at the source of the fluctuation. His face slightly changed.

In his view, there were many people standing there, each of them extremely powerful. There were also quite a few people Luo Tian was familiar with, such as Ye Wudao, Ye Sheng and Ye Tian. Zhang Ziping and Jiang Taibai were also standing there, divided into several factions.

"Little Tian, come over!" Zhang Ziping saw Luo Tian and his eyes showed a hint of joy as he called out to Luo Tian.

"Little Tian?" Ye Wudao also exclaimed, watching Luo Tian walking towards their direction. His eyes showed a look of surprise.

"Father!" Luo Tian bowed to Ye Wudao, his voice filled with respect. Jiang Taibai and others naturally belonged to the Bu Tian Sect.

Other sects also stood there. Luo Tian's appearance only caused a commotion among the people, but their attention was entirely focused on a gray barrier surrounded by everyone.

Luo Tian also directed his gaze to this gray barrier. His body slightly paused.

The gray barrier was somewhat similar to Luo Tian's domain of boundaries, but he could feel that this barrier was thousands of times stronger than his own. It was simply not on the same level. Moreover, there were also gray vapors drifting around the barrier, as if a group of ghosts, giving people an eerie feeling.

"This is the world's barrier. It was formed by the Heart of the World itself. As for the souls on this world's barrier, they should be the original residents of this small world who died in that apocalyptic turmoil. Some were protected by the Heart of the World's instinct and formed!"

They had been attacking it for years, but they had only managed to create a crack. "Zhang Ziping pointed at the crack on the barrier.

The crack was not very large, about the length of an adult's arm. A fluctuation of soul energy came out from the crack, not particularly strong but still making Luo Tian frown.

"Let me say it. Whoever gets it, it's theirs. We've all been attacking for so long, and no one has an easy time!" A middle-aged man spoke. He was the leader of the Yixiantian Bai family.

"Who says so? For these years, who put in more effort, everyone knows. We were the first to come in. It should be us who try it first!" The people of Bai family said, and then someone else expressed dissatisfaction.

"These people haven't even seen the Heart of the World yet, but they're already thinking about how to divide it!" Luo Tian thought in silence. He watched the people arguing, his gaze deep as he looked at the gray barrier. Others couldn't feel it, but Luo Tian, being a Soul Sealer, could sense an astonishing fluctuation within this domain. This fluctuation should be a soul.

"Help me..." As Luo Tian was confused, a series of murmurs came into his mind, making him tremble.

Chapter 2387: The Millions of Suffering Souls

A gentle call, as if coming from the distant ancient times, echoed in Luo Tian's ears. The voice carried a sense of longing, making Luo Tian want to rush into the gray barrier.

"Who are you?" Luo Tian's mind shook, and he communicated with that mental connection. At the same time, he watched others; they were still arguing.

"I am a child of this world!"

"And I felt the same aura on you!" A low voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him frown.

"Do I have the same aura as you?" Luo Tian was confused about who this voice's owner was.

"Come in. Once inside, you will understand!" A rather anxious voice said, making Luo Tian confused.

"Let's break through the barrier first!" As Luo Tian was confused, Fu Tianhan's voice rang out, making Luo Tian snap back to his senses.

"Yes, first break through it and then talk about the division!" Someone echoed Fu Tianhan's opinion.

"Break your ass!" Luo Tian thought to himself, these people were really bold. They wanted to directly break through the barrier.

However, everyone here was a Celestial King-level powerhouse. There were over a hundred of them, with dozens at the middle stage of Celestial King. Such terrifying strength was not afraid of any danger, but these people hadn't thought about it. The Heart of the World had once blocked even Immortal Celestial Kings.

"Don't attack! There's a terrifying presence inside!" As people were about to attack, Luo Tian shouted loudly, making them pause slightly.

"Luo Tian?" Everyone saw Luo Tian and their eyes showed contempt. These people were all great masters, and they didn't look at Luo Tian, a young man who had just become a Celestial King.

"Where did this little kid come from? Go play somewhere else!" A big man shouted. Although Luo Tian was standing with Jiang Taibai and others, they still didn't take Luo Tian seriously.

"You're not even worthy to call him my son!" Ye Wudao coldly sneered, his gaze directed at that sect leader. The man immediately retreated and didn't dare to speak again.

"Attack!" It was just a small incident. People ignored Luo Tian's words and began to gather powerful martial arts, preparing to attack the barrier.

"Idiots!" Luo Tian thought to himself. These people were used to being in charge and didn't allow anyone else to contradict them.

The Bu Tian Sect did not move, as they trusted Luo Tian. However, there were also many people from other factions. In an instant, light spread everywhere, and a series of terrifying fluctuations attacked the gray barrier.

Such attacks from so many Celestial King-level powers could not be endured. Even a Celestial King at the late stage would definitely be killed.

Boom, boom, boom...

The thunderous sound shook the entire golden space. A series of terrifying martial arts attacked the barrier, shaking Luo Tian's ears.

"Uncle, what should we do?" Jiang Yuzhe looked at Jiang Taibai with a worried expression. After the group's attack, the previous crack had grown slightly.

"Luotian, do you have any ideas?" Jiang Taibai frowned and looked at Luo Tian.

"Leave. Wait for me outside! I'll go in to check. If I succeed, you protect me and leave this small world. If I fail, then run as far away as possible!" Luo Tian spoke to Jiang Taibai and others.

"Do you have a chance?" Jiang Taibai's brow didn't relax. This was no small matter.

"Three in ten chances. There's no time to explain, these fools are about to attack again!" Luo Tian thought to himself. He watched as those people's hands once again glowed with powerful fluctuations, and he was anxious.

"Okay!" Jiang Taibai looked at Luo Tian deeply. Then he nodded to Ye Wudao and others, took off into the air, rushing back through the golden passage he had come from.

"Brave guy. Did that kid scare you?" People watched Jiang Taibai and others leaving, but they didn't stop them. The Bu Tian Sect's strength was very strong. Jiang Taibai and others leaving was a competitor for them.

"How can I help you?" Luo Tian tried to communicate with that voice again, watching as they gathered martial arts and attacked the gray barrier.

The thunderous sound rang out again. It made people's minds tremble, and a series of roaring sounds came from the barrier, sending out cold air through the newly cracked cracks.

"Roar..."

Gray energy transformed into a group of gray souls, roaring towards the people.

"Too weak!" One Celestial King looked at them and a group of fragile souls instantly turned to dust, disappearing from people's sight. In an instant, thousands of souls were destroyed by that Celestial King's gaze, making Luo Tian frown slightly.

"Go..." However, Luo Tian didn't say anything. He took off into the air and rushed towards the barrier.

"Are you trying to die?" People exclaimed, watching Luo Tian rushing toward the barrier. They had been attacking it for decades and only managed to create such a small crack. They knew the barrier's strength was definitely not something one person could break through.

"Everyone, attack and break the crack!" As Luo Tian moved, Nie Yuntian shouted loudly, shouting at the strength of the Eternal Life Sect. Immediately thirteen Celestial King-level powers gathered their attacks and struck towards the barrier.

Not only that, but many others also launched their attacks. Powerful martial arts destroyed heaven and earth, striking towards the barrier.

Those martial arts seemed to be aimed at the barrier but their target was Luo Tian!

"Son of a bitch!" In an instant, Luo Tian felt the danger to his life. If he was hit, he would be reduced to nothing left. That was nearly thirty Celestial Kings' full power attack.

"Buzz..." The gray domain opened, and thousands of souls roared. Luo Tian instantly arrived at the gray barrier.

"Indeed, he didn't lie to me!" Luo Tian was happy. He felt his domain could pass through the barrier, and he felt a bit more at ease.

In an instant, Luo Tian rushed into the barrier. At the same time, a series of destructive martial arts hit the barrier again and thunderous sound rang out.

The storm passed. People looked at the barrier but didn't see Luo Tian's figure. Nie Yuntian's eyes showed a strong joy.

"That kid must have been beaten to death..." People whispered, watching the still intact barrier.

Luo Tian didn't know what people outside were thinking. He had already appeared inside the barrier, his eyes showing shock.

Soul, countless souls appeared in Luo Tian's view. Countless, definitely the most number of souls he had seen except for those in hell.

"Roar..." Seeing Luo Tian, these soulless souls rushed towards him to devour him.

"Shake..." Luo Tian's body shook. The aura of a Soul Sealer burst out, making those souls stop in place.

"Come on, my friends. I'm about to give up!" The voice echoed again in Luo Tian's mind, making him cautious.

"Take a chance!" Luo Tian frowned and cautiously walked deeper. Those souls naturally didn't dare to block him, but they showed enthusiasm, making Luo Tian walk deeper.

After about half an hour, golden light appeared in Luo Tian's view. A golden heart floated above the gray space, emitting a powerful aura.

"The Heart of the World!" Luo Tian's eyes showed joy. However, his gaze was fixed on a solid gray body under the Heart of the World.

The gray body wasn't very strong, but there was an aura that made Luo Tian feel shocked. He could clearly sense several auras moving within the gray body.

"This soul should be the one I sensed!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. He released the aura of a Soul Sealer, covering that seated soul to prevent any accidents.

"Hmm?" When the aura of a Soul Sealer was released, that gray soul seated under the Heart of the World opened its eyes. Its eyes were cold.

"Enemy!" The cold voice was like a thousand people shouting at the same time. The gray soul looked at Luo Tian with hatred and stood up, rushing towards him.

"Damn..." Luo Tian was shocked. He unleashed the maximum power of a Soul Sealer towards that gray soul. However, Luo Tian was even more shocked. That aura of heaven's power, which was like a divine punishment for souls, was completely ineffective against this soul. It wasn't affected at all.

"What is this thing?" Luo Tian stepped back and simultaneously punched, colliding with that gray soul's fist.

"Boom..." An invisible fluctuation rang out. Luo Tian's heart was filled with waves of shock. That gray fist directly penetrated his flesh and shook his soul, making his body tremble violently.

"I can't fight!" Luo Tian made a quick judgment. The brief confrontation had revealed this soul's strength.

"Roar..." The gray soul took a deep breath, and an invisible suction came from its mouth. At the same time, the countless souls surrounding the entire barrier let out cries of desperation.

But it was no use. A large number of souls flew towards that soul and were absorbed into its body.

"Feeding on souls?" Luo Tian had some guesses. His eyes became more serious as he looked at the golden Heart of the World.

It should be that this small world collapsed, and the souls of its original residents were protected by the Heart of the World. They had been absorbed here and then devoured each other, forming a soul. After reaching a certain level of strength, it had absorbed the power of the Heart of the World and formed its own independent consciousness.

Anger filled the air. Clearly, although it had gained its own awareness, it still retained the resentment of those souls it had devoured. It saw Luo Tian as an intruder and wanted to destroy him.

Luo Tian's lips twitched. He took another step back, shouting: "How can I help you? I can't handle this soul!"

Chapter 2388: The Emperor's Soul

"Buzz..." The gray soul, like a shadowy figure, instantly appeared in front of Luo Tian and punched again.

The gray fist shattered the void. Cold sweat flowed down Luo Tian's face. He unleashed his chaotic wind and punched back.

"Boom..." A heavy sound rang out again. Luo Tian's face was pale, feeling his soul almost being shaken out of his body.

"What is this thing!" Luo Tian was angry in his heart. He stepped back and steadied himself.

"I'll help you!" A low whisper echoed in Luo Tian's mind. At the same time, the golden Heart of the World emitted a series of divine lights. All the souls in the barrier roared, their eyes showing enthusiasm and gathering towards the Heart of the World.

"Buzz..." The golden Heart of the World transformed into a stream of light and rushed towards Luo Tian. That soul let out a roar and reached for the Heart of the World.

However, the Heart of the World was too fast and sudden. Even that soul couldn't catch it. The Heart of the World instantly disappeared into Luo Tian's chest.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian immediately stopped. At the same time, he felt his heart shrink slightly as if grabbed by a big hand and crushed.

Luo Tian was overwhelmed by pain, cursing: "I came to help you, but you wanted to kill me!"

"Buzz..." However, as Luo Tian cursed, the golden Heart of the World replaced the position of his broken heart and connected with many meridians.

"Boom, boom, boom..." The golden heart beat. A series of terrifying fluctuations instantly spread throughout Luo Tian's body. His aura began to rise, especially his soul, which started to grow rapidly.

Each time the heart beat strongly, Luo Tian's aura increased by a level. This made Luo Tian happy.

In an instant, Luo Tian felt his soul had reached a terrifying level. The gray soul rushed out of his body and stood in front of Luo Tian's flesh, looking at the gray soul that rushed towards him again.

"Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, I alone am the supreme!" The gray soul of Luo Tian whispered to himself. His body radiated an unparalleled aura. At this moment, even if a soul of the peak Celestial King appeared in front of him, it would be suppressed. Because he was not only a peak soul but also a Soul Sealer.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian was thinking, the gray soul rushed towards him again. The gray fist punched out.

This time, Luo Tian had no fear at all and punched back with the same strength. The gray fist collided with his.

"Boom, boom..." Power spread everywhere. Many souls were annihilated in the collision between Luo Tian and that soul. Both Luo Tian and that soul took a step back.

"This soul is the one from Xuan Yue, formed by all living beings' resentment. Please destroy it!"

"Preserve the last bit of Xuan Yue's fire!" A whisper echoed in Luo Tian's mind. After that, there was no more sound.

"Did it end like this?" Luo Tian felt a bit speechless. However, he had understood that the source of this voice was from the Heart of the World, communicating with him through thought. After so many years, the power of the Heart of the World had already been absorbed by this evil soul. That was why this evil soul had become so powerful.

"Suppress it!" Thinking about that, Luo Tian understood and extended his hand. A terrifying aura radiated from him as he pointed out.

"Roar..." Countless souls roared, watching Luo Tian emit a fierce aura. They looked at him as if they were looking at their parents, roaring with longing.

"Emperor's Soul!" Luo Tian instantly felt his strength. He knew that there was a special level for souls, which was the Emperor's Soul. Once reaching this level, one could dominate alone with just their soul and survive without a body.

Although Luo Tian was strong, the evil soul did not fear him. It started to rush towards Luo Tian fiercely. Two souls collided repeatedly, and countless souls were annihilated in the waves of their confrontation.

While Luo Tian and the evil soul fought, the terrifying fluctuation also seeped into some golden halls through the crack in the barrier. This fluctuation made people inside the hall shocked.

"Did that kid really say there was danger?" People whispered, listening to the thunderous sound from the barrier and it directly hit their souls. They stopped.

At this time, the gray barrier had been broken to the size of a thigh. People could now see the wandering souls inside the barrier.

"There's nothing to worry about. We are so many people, and we're not afraid of these souls!" Someone spoke, encouraging the others.

"Indeed. The Heart of the World, we can't give it up!" Soon after, people started to gather their martial arts.

Inside the barrier, Luo Tian and the evil soul kept fighting. Thunderous sounds continued. Neither could overcome the other. Luo Tian's soul was strong, and the evil soul's methods were also endless.

After a dangerous confrontation of an hour, both Luo Tian and the evil soul had weakened. They were no longer as strong as before.

"Roar..." The evil soul let out a low roar, apparently knowing that this person was not easy to deal with. Also, the thing that could enhance its strength was no longer there. It didn't linger and rushed towards Luo Tian's body, trying to take over his flesh.

"Only you?" Luo Tian sneered and flew up. He rushed into Luo Tian's body, and both fought on the battlefield of Luo Tian's flesh.

However, this time, Luo Tian had the upper hand. This body was his own, and he was fighting on home ground.

"Boom..." After another half hour, a battered soul flew out of Luo Tian's body. It was clearly much more transparent than before.

The evil soul opened its mouth and sucked in a large number of souls, which were then devoured by the evil soul. This allowed it to recover some strength.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian's soul was about to go out, a thunderous sound rang out in the barrier. After people's attacks, the gray barrier finally burst.

"Roar..." As the barrier broke, everyone's eyes followed it.

"For decades, we finally broke through. The Heart of the World must belong to me!" A long rainbow rushed towards the barrier's direction.

"You're nothing!" Someone led, and others also regained their senses. They rushed towards the broken barrier.

"Boom..." As people just moved, countless souls burst out from the direction of the barrier and rushed in all directions.

"What is this!" People knew there might be danger, but they hadn't expected such a situation. When had they seen so many souls before? They were immediately frightened.

A group of souls rushed, although weak, but the number was too terrifying. They formed a terrible storm and swept towards all sides, colliding with people's bodies.

"Destroy!" Nie Yun Tian and others spoke. They were initially frightened but then reacted, speaking their words into law. Immediately, a large number of souls were destroyed by them.

Screams of agony kept coming out. A group of souls rushed towards the golden passage.

In the soul storm, Luo Tian's face was grim. The evil soul had been suppressed by him before, but these fools had broken the barrier and let the evil soul escape with the storm. He didn't know where it was.

Luo Tian had recovered to normal, and his soul had increased significantly. Although not an Emperor's Soul, it was comparable to a late-stage Celestial King soul. Combined with the Soul Sealer's power, Luo Tian could still suppress any soul.

The most important thing was that his heart had unknowingly changed from golden to a dark black color, obviously having been corrupted by demonic energy.

"A great fortune!" Luo Tian felt excited. Although he didn't know what benefit the Heart of the World had become for his heart, it was definitely beyond Luo Tian's imagination. This was something that even several Celestial Kings wanted.

Afterward, Luo Tian saw the souls that had been mostly destroyed by the powerful people. His brows slightly furrowed.

"Reincarnation!" Luo Tian hadn't forgotten the Heart of the World's instructions when it lost consciousness. He waved his hand and launched a Reincarnation punch.

A massive reincarnation passage appeared, spanning the entire golden space. The golden space was instantly shattered by the reincarnation passage.

Boom, boom...

As the entire space broke apart, Luo Tian and others appeared under the stars. Only countless souls were drifting.

The thunderous sound spread everywhere. Luo Tian pointed his finger, and a piece of the gray passage cracked, sending out waves of suction in space.

"What's going on?" Everyone had a look of shock. They saw the reincarnation passage almost贯穿 the entire starry sky.

As people were stunned, those souls rushed into the reincarnation passage. Luo Tian's hands formed a seal and filled the gap in the reincarnation passage with soul seals. The reincarnation passage slowly disappeared from everyone's sight.

"Where is that evil soul?" Luo Tian's eyes were like lightning. He always felt that this evil soul was a potential threat. If it recovered, it might bring him great trouble. After all, he had ruined its plans.

"Luo Tian!" As the souls disappeared, people instantly saw Luo Tian's figure. Their eyes showed disbelief.

"He wasn't dead!" People exclaimed, not expecting Luo Tian to survive after that attack.

"Damn it. Where's the Heart of the World!" Then people suddenly remembered and looked around, but they didn't find the world heart that they had longed for.

"It must have been taken by him!" Nie Yuntian and Fu Tianhan shouted. Immediately, they shouted a loud voice. A terrifying fluctuation spread from their hands.

"Yes, he's not dead. He must have entered the barrier in a special way and taken the Heart of the World!"

"He is a senior of Bu Tian Sect, but he has offended Eternal Life Sect and Eastern Emperor Sect. And for the Heart of the World, we will kill him. Several Celestial Kings will protect us!" Someone spoke. A golden seal had already risen, pressing down towards Luo Tian.

Chapter 2389: Fortune

One person attacked. Others also responded, and several more attacks appeared out of nowhere. Among them were even Celestial Kings at the middle stage.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed, watching those people who had already gone red-eyed. He was still looking for the evil soul when their attacks came.

Luo Tian didn't dare to fight back. He took off into the air, pushing his Yellow River Step to its limit and instantly appearing tens of thousands of feet away.

"Boom, boom..." Luo Tian's reaction was fast. However, a few attacks still hit him hard, making him spit blood and his face pale.

"Hand over the Heart of the World!" A group shouted. Some truly wanted the Heart of the World, while others really wanted Luo Tian dead. Anyway, now Luo Tian had become an object for people to vent their anger.

"Hand your ass!" Luo Tian cursed, taking off into the air and rushing towards the continent where Nan Gong Yuqing and others were. Only there did he have protection.

"you can't escape!" A group shouted, chasing after Luo Tian. The sound of battle filled the sky. As Luo Tian left a shadow behind, the space exploded everywhere due to their martial arts.

"Who dares to touch my Bu Tian Sect senior!" As Luo Tian just took off, Jiang Taibai and others who had flown out before suddenly appeared. They blocked the way for everyone.

"Block as many as you can, it's about survival!" At this moment, Luo Tian had already disappeared. However, he still sent a mental message to Jiang Taibai and others.

Although the Xuan Yue World was vast, for Celestial Kings who could traverse the world and sky, it wasn't big at all. Jiang Taibai held a golden sword and directly blocked a middle-stage Celestial King, Zhang Ziping. Jiang Yuzhe and others also launched attacks against those people.

However, a few people were limited in their strength. They could only block some people. Of course, others who saw Jiang Taibai and others appear also stopped chasing them. After all, Bu Tian Sect was not easy to provoke. Their back-up forces were fearless of Bu Tian Sect but didn't want to add trouble.

Mount Meru and the瑶池 (Jade Pool) sects also did not chase after Luo Tian. They stood under the starry sky. Mount Meru, as a Buddhist sect, emphasized everything being in harmony. They didn't care about the truth and had no intention of chasing.

As for the Jade Pool, several female-appearing Celestial King-level powers did not chase after him. They had once learned about an unknown past story, that of the peak Celestial King of Jade Pool and Bu Tian's Celestial King. Therefore, they did not chase after him.

Even so, dozens of people chased after Luo Tian, making his scalp tingle. Every moment was a life-or-death crisis.

The starry sky exploded, and they pushed forward all the way. Luo Tian's speed kept increasing. He even started to burn his blood, otherwise he couldn't outrun some martial arts.

An hour later, Luo Tian landed on the continent where Nan Gong Yuqing and others were.

"Vanishing Sky, prepare!" Luo Tian's loud voice rose throughout the entire continent. As he spoke, he landed on the vast continent and reached for a command flag.

"Damn!" A "damn" echoed, and golden light rose from all four corners of the continent.

"Can't escape!" Dozens of Celestial King-level powers instantly rushed into the continent. As soon as they found Luo Tian's direction, a series of arrays immediately erupted with thunderous power.

Lightning... poison gas... fire... pressure... A series of arrays opened instantly, making those Celestial King-level powers feel a crisis. Their eyes showed disbelief.

"Damn it... what's going on, why are there so many powerful arrays!" A Celestial King at the early stage of power shouted in confusion. He was constantly struck by purple lightning, his body smoking.

"Run!" Luo Tian held the golden command flag that Vanishing Sky had given him. He found where Nan Gong Yuqing and others were, then shouted to them.

Vanishing Sky's array was very strong. It could trap a Celestial King and even kill two or three Celestial Kings. However, this was a group of Celestial Kings. Luo Tian knew that this continent would eventually not be able to withstand it.

"What did you do!" Diao Dezhu, who had already returned, frowned and looked at the people being attacked by arrays. His feet didn't slow down at all as he took off into the air and flew out of the continent.

"Hide, go as far away as possible. Find Jiang Taibai's elder and stay with him!" Luo Tian shouted to them, not having time to explain much. He separated from them and fled away as a streak of light.

"May you never have peace, Luo Tian!" The vast continent was still roaring. That series of powerful arrays had roared for half an hour before finally stopping.

"Boom..." Finally, even the continent could not withstand the arrays' attacks. It exploded and burst into the starry sky, with a series of figures appearing in the starry sky. They were all battered.

"May you never have peace, Luo Tian!" A series of figures shouted. Although they had been wounded, they still rushed forward to find Luo Tian's figure.

However, half an hour was enough for Luo Tian. Enough time to find a hiding place. What he needed to do now was wait until the Bu Tian Celestial King could enter here, and then he could go out. The rest of the matters would be handled by the Bu Tian Celestial King. After all, the Heart of the World had now become his heart.

At this moment, Luo Tian was on an unremarkable continent. The entire continent was very desolate. He sat in a cave, not having set up any arrays. He knew that with his array skills, it didn't matter whether he set them or not.

But Luo Tian had his confidence. That was the powerful spiritual awareness, especially after it had been enhanced. He used spiritual awareness to cover himself. Unless a Celestial King at the late stage could find him or come down to this continent and search one by one.

"Bu Tian Stone would be good!" Luo Tian was very nostalgic for the Bu Tian Stone. If it were here, it could completely hide him until the end of time.

Now he was confident but also had some risks. Those people would eventually find him here.

Meanwhile, in the Demon Cloud City of the Celestial Realm, a group of powerful beings stood there. Their eyes looked at the sky and moved slightly.

"The protective power has weakened!"

"One hour, just one hour. We can enter!" The Eternal Life Celestial King spoke softly.

"Is it because someone inside has successfully obtained the Heart of the World?" Several peak Celestial Kings also spoke. The Hell side was tightly watching the space rift, waiting for people inside to come out and attack together.

At the same time, in the Xuan Yue World, Celestial Kings kept searching for Luo Tian's figure but still couldn't find it.

They searched for a day without success. Finally, they chose to search separately. The entire Xuan Yue World was in chaos.

Nan Gong Yuqing and Diao Dezhu met up with Jiang Taibai and others. They did not continue to block those people.
