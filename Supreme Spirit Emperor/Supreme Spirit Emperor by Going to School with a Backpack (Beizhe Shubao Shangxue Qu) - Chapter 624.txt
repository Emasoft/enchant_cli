The sects of the Lower Three Heavens displayed varied attitudes. Some expressed disdain, for even with countless people, without a strong leader, they were but scattered sand. Yet the intent of the Heavenly Origin Sect was clear to all—that was to vie for dominion over Heaven. Such power would never be content with lingering in the Lower Three Heavens, thus inevitably clashing with the three new sects that possessed the Struggle for Heaven Mandate.

"However, since the Ascending Dragon Sect successfully vied for dominion over Heaven, those three sects are no pushovers. They have monopolized resources; none of them are virtuous, exploiting us. It is said that all three sects have already attained the status of Half-Step Immortal Kings!" Each sect awaited with anticipation, eager to witness this formidable Heavenly Origin Sect, newly emerged and terrifyingly powerful, clashing against the three sects.

As the Heavenly Origin Sect appeared, a name long forgotten resurfaced in people's memories. Luo Tian, once the Disciple of the Ascending Dragon Sect, who had single-handedly unified the three sects of the previous realm. Yet this time, he bore a different identity—Master of the Heavenly Origin Sect. All were curious about what had transpired to bring Luo Tian back to the Lower Three Heavens.

"An excellent name, Heavenly Origin Sect. But to wrest the Struggle for Heaven Mandate from my White Moon Pavilion? You lack the qualifications!" Within one of the three new sects, the White Moon Pavilion, a middle-aged man sneered as he listened to his spies' reports. His voice was cold and dismissive.

The other two sects also scoffed, doubting whether Luo Tian could stir up any storm. Yet they still chose to arrive at the Heavenly Origin Sect's founding ceremony, hoping to deliver a warning and establish their authority.

In a mist-laden valley, a figure sat cross-legged atop the peak of one of the three sects, Xuanwu Valley. His face bore a contemplative expression.

"Back then, Guan Hongsheng was destroyed by Luo Tian. I wonder if Luo Tian knows the secret of Guan Hongsheng!" A middle-aged man murmured to himself. This was Xuanwu Valley's Master, Ren Dutian.

The entire Lower Three Heavens watched the Heavenly Origin Sect closely. Yet Luo Tian headed toward the Death Desert, not directly but first stopping at his former sect, the Chaos Heaven Sect.

The Chaos Heaven Sect was even worse off than the Ascending Dragon Sect, now reduced to ruins. The mountain was overgrown with weeds, its massive body riddled with cracks—evidence of the many enemies Guan Hongsheng had made.

"Where is the Mirage Stone? Is it here?" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he landed on what had become a ruin.

He reached for the Mirage Stone around his neck but found it unresponsive, disappointment flashing in his eyes.

Yet Luo Tian was undeterred. His hands formed seals, and attacks erupted from his palms, pushing him from the mountain's base to its summit. Still, he found no trace of the Mirage Stone.

"It makes sense. The Mirage Stone is a rare treasure; if it were here, someone would have taken it. Its owner wouldn't remain obscure in the Lower Three Heavens. More likely, they've recently surged in power—most suspicious!" Luo Tian mused internally. Yet at this point, they had just arrived in the Lower Three Heavens and lacked any local intelligence.

"Let's head to the Death Desert first," Luo Tian murmured, then took flight toward the desert.

After three days of travel, Luo Tian reached the edge of the Death Desert, gazing at its endless dunes. His eyes reflected admiration.

Back then, he had arrived here as a Heaven-Realm cultivator; now, he was a Half-Step Immortal King. In the Lower Three Heavens, he could dominate, yet as he walked outside Shasha City, he still felt the desert's terror. Even now, he might end up buried here.

Bearing the wind and sand, Luo Tian approached Shasha City's gates. The city remained lively, an odd contrast to the desert's desolation.

Luo Tian strode directly toward Shasha City's center, for he knew it was under Fire Lord Meng Wushuang's domain. Perhaps he could find Ran Hao there.

"Surely this boy has made great progress under Fire Lord Meng Wushuang's tutelage!" Luo Tian smiled, recalling the timid youth he once knew.

At Shasha City's Governor's Mansion, Luo Tian approached the gates and addressed the guards: "Please inform the city governor that I, Luo Tian, wish to see him."

"Who is Luo Tian? Can you just barge in on the governor?" The two guards sneered, unimpressed.

"Ah?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly as his aura descended, pressing upon the guards.

"Luotian!" A voice of disbelief echoed in Luo Tian's ears as a figure appeared before him.

Chapter 2353: The Shasha City Uprising

"Zhao Tianping?" Luo Tian also recognized the man emerging from the gates, his brows furrowing slightly. This was Zhao Tianping of the Zhao family, one of Shasha City's four major clans. Luo Tian noted that Zhao Tianping seemed to move about freely.

After years apart, Zhao Tianping had reached the peak of True Immortal, his aura formidable and his gaze filled with authority.

"Respectful greetings, Master Zhao!" The two guards bowed respectfully to Zhao Tianping before turning their gaze toward Luo Tian, assuming he knew him.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian asked coldly, watching Zhao Tianping step out of the courtyard.

"Killing my nephew! I didn't expect you to dare return!" Zhao Tianping roared, his hand shooting out. A golden True Immortal aura surged forward, striking Luo Tian with a thunderous impact.

"Think I'm still the same as before?" Luo Tian sneered, his finger pressing out. The world trembled as a massive hand crushed Zhao Tianping's attack.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed, and Zhao Tianping's hand was shattered by Luo Tian's single finger. Zhao Tianping was hurled backward, colliding with Shasha Palace's gate.

"How strong!" Zhao Tianping's face darkened, gazing at Luo Tian standing there. He hadn't expected that even now, he could not match a single finger of Luo Tian's power.

Luo Tian extended his hand, seizing Zhao Tianping and pulling him forward. His eyes glowed coldly, his voice like a chilling wind that made Zhao Tianping shiver uncontrollably.

"Why are you here? What's happened in Shasha City?" Luo Tian asked coldly, his gaze sharp and assessing. He sensed something was amiss in Shasha City.

Behind Shasha Palace stood Fire Lord Meng Wushuang, a second manifestation of Gu Qianxue. Even if it was Gu Qianxue, Luo Tian didn't want to see Ran Hao suffer.

"I beg you, save me!" Zhao Tianping cried out, his voice echoing into Shasha Palace. Actually, he didn't need to shout; several figures had already rushed out of the palace upon seeing Zhao Tianping held by the throat. Their eyes widened in surprise.

"Who are you? Let go of my father immediately!" A young man shouted, his white robes flowing. His aura was formidable—half-step Immortal King.

Zhao Chengfeng, the former prodigy of Shasha City's four major clans, had now grown to such heights. His speed rivaled even the geniuses of the Middle Three Heavens, matching Luo Tian's current status as a half-step Immortal King. Yet even now, he had only recently attained the rank and was unstable. His time in half-step Immortal King was no more than a month.

"Where are Shao Lao and Chen?" Luo Tian observed the figures behind Zhao Chengfeng, noting they were all unfamiliar faces. None of them were old Shasha Palace figures; his mood darkened further.

The three True Immortal peak vice-palace masters were also absent, and Shasha Palace seemed to have changed hands. The Zhao family had taken control.

"Let go of my father!" Zhao Chengfeng roared, stepping toward Luo Tian. His half-step Immortal King aura pressed down upon him with each step, shaking the earth.

Ordinarily, such an aura would intimidate anyone, but Luo Tian was no ordinary opponent. Not even a half-step Immortal King could scare him; he would not fear an early-stage Immortal King.

"Speak—how did you end up in Shasha Palace?" Luo Tian asked coldly, the sound of cracking echoing from Zhao Tianping's neck as Zhao Chengfeng halted.

"You... aren't a Shasha City native?"

"Three days ago, Shasha City changed hands. From now on, it belongs to the Zhao family, not Meng!" Zhao Chengfeng sneered. They had planned for this day meticulously.

They had waited years, and finally, ten years ago, a colossal sandstorm erupted in the Death Desert. The entire desert seemed to turn upside down, like an apocalyptic storm that lasted a year before ceasing.

After the sandstorm ended, the Death Desert became lifeless; no one knew what had transpired. The terrifying energy was beyond anyone's ability to withstand.

The two True Immortal peak vice-palace masters of Shasha Palace had entered the Death Desert after the sandstorm ceased, for that energy was so fearsome even Immortal Kings might perish. It felt like a natural disaster.

Yet the two masters never returned, and after several years, Shasha City became a prime target. Many sects from the Middle Three Heavens had noticed Meng Wushuang and the two vice-palace masters' disappearance.

The four major clans were merely vassals; only the Jiao family remained loyal to Shasha Palace. The others were opportunists, though some were loyal, their loyalty was not deep.

The Zhao family had been installed as the new Shasha City governor by sects, and three days ago, they seized control of the city. Luo Tian arrived today.

"Where are Ran Hao and Shao Honglang?" Luo Tian asked coldly. His current status was no longer what it had been; though not among the Middle Three Heavens' top-tier, he was backed by Star River Palace and Supplement Heaven Mountain. Few dared to challenge him.

"Ran Hao?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, those present stiffened slightly. Zhao Chengfeng's eyes narrowed.

"You're Luo Tian, right? I've heard you were strong before. Today, I'll avenge my brother!" Zhao Chengfeng's eyes burned with battle intent as he took another step.

"Crack..." Luo Tian tightened his grip, his gaze locking onto Zhao Chengfeng: "I'll ask one last time—where is Ran Hao?"

"That brat and that old man are still alive. Once I capture you, I'll send both of you to your deaths!" Zhao Chengfeng's eyes flashed with confidence as he vanished from sight.

"Just you, a trash!" Luo Tian didn't even think twice before sweeping his leg, breaking through space. At the spot he swept, a figure suddenly appeared, eyes wide with disbelief.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed as Zhao Chengfeng's body appeared in view, but he was battered and broken. His entire body collided with Shasha Palace's high wall, toppling it in a collapse.

"Back then, I should have wiped out the Zhao family!" Luo Tian cursed internally as he clenched his hand. A crack echoed, and Zhao Tianping's neck snapped like a dead dog, thrown to the ground.

"This..." Seeing Luo Tian kill Zhao Tianping on the spot, people were stunned. Many recognized him, but over time, they had forgotten. After all, Luo Tian hadn't stayed long in Shasha City.

Shasha City was far from the other sects of the Middle Three Heavens, and few received news about Luo Tian.

"Kill..." Zhao Chengfeng rose, his eyes filled with madness, especially after seeing Zhao Tianping's death. He flew toward Luo Tian.

"Overestimating yourself!" Luo Tian sneered, not believing there was only one Zhao family who knew where Ran Hao was.

As he spoke, Zhao Chengfeng had already closed in on Luo Tian, his blade slicing down toward Luo Tian's head.

Luo Tian ignored it, and in the stunned gazes of onlookers, he extended his hand to meet the blade's edge.

"Crash..." The blade shattered, and Luo Tian grasped it with his hand. He then kicked Zhao Chengfeng's chest.

"Crack..." A crack echoed as Zhao Chengfeng's chest caved in, and his body was hurled backward, spewing blood.

"Boom..." Zhao Chengfeng's body fell to the ground again, his eyes filled with terror as he gazed at Luo Tian, now wrapped in demonic energy. He looked like a monster.

"How is this possible!" Zhao Chengfeng coughed blood, speaking through his pain. He had been forcibly elevated to half-step Immortal King by the sects that coveted Shasha City, tasked with ruling it and siphoning resources.

Though Zhao Chengfeng had only recently attained half-step Immortal King and was forcibly promoted, he hadn't expected to be so weak before Luo Tian. Two kicks had left him helpless.

Luo Tian's eyes burned with fury as he stepped toward Zhao Chengfeng, lifting his foot high. Zhao Chengfeng's face paled.

"I'll tell you where Ran Hao is!" Zhao Chengfeng spoke, his mind filled with a sense of impending doom.

"Too late..." Luo Tian coldly replied, his foot descending like a shattered melon, splattering crimson blood across the ground. The onlookers trembled.

"Within half a bell, find Ran Hao and the original Shasha City people; otherwise, none shall live!" Luo Tian shouted, his gaze filled with killing intent.

"Yes, yes..." The remaining people dared not resist. Killing the Zhao family was as simple as killing a chicken, let alone them.

Two middle-aged men in True Immortal peak rushed toward Shasha Palace. They were the other two major families of Shasha City.

"Star of doom! Absolute star of doom!" Their minds shook, not expecting Fire Lord Meng Wushuang's absence to bring such a presence.

In the dark dungeon, people were imprisoned. Deep within the dungeon, a figure was bound by chains, his body covered in wounds and torn clothes. A jailer held a red whip, repeatedly lashing the prisoner's body. Each strike left a crimson wound, and the blood was evaporated.

"You shouldn't blame me; one emperor, one minister—why did Fire Lord disappear? If he were here, you'd still be Shasha City's governor!" The jailer spoke softly, his eyes filled with pity. Yet his whip grew harsher, a glint of satisfaction in his gaze.

If this had happened years ago, the jailer would never have imagined himself torturing Fire Lord Meng Wushuang's disciples and Shasha Palace's vice-palace masters.

Chapter 2354: Allies

"Vice-Palace Master, Governor, Jiao family's patriarch—ha! Now you're all prisoners too, aren't you? I heard the governor's wife is quite beautiful. Let us brothers take a look!" The jailer smiled, his gaze on the barely conscious Ran Hao, Shao Honglang, and Jiao family's patriarch. His whip continued to fall.

"Shame..." Ran Hao's eyes burned with fire, their pain overshadowed by the humiliation inflicted by the jailer.

"Stop!" But just as the jailer raised his whip again, two furious voices echoed. A fiery red hand struck the jailer's body, turning him into a mass of blood.

Several figures appeared before Ran Hao and the others, their gazes trembling at the sight of their pitiful state.

"Done! No matter what, we must save them first!" The two family patriarchs broke out in sweat, quickly unbinding Ran Hao and Shao Honglang. Their bodies fell to the ground in a heap.

"Three of you, we failed to protect you properly. Please forgive us!" One family patriarch smiled sycophantically, quickly administering pills to Ran Hao and the others.

"Lin Xie, if you want to kill, just do it. Old Shao won't blink an eye; Fire Lord will avenge us. Wait, he'll return!" Shao Honglang laughed bitterly, his voice resolute.

"Shao elder, we would never kill you! We've known each other for years!" The man named Lin Xie, patriarch of the Lin family, smiled respectfully.

If it had been two days ago, they wouldn't have taken Shao Honglang seriously. After all, he was merely a True Immortal peak. But now that they had captured him, they could have killed him. They hadn't because they hoped Fire Lord would return and uncover secrets from the three.

But they hadn't expected Fire Lord to never return, instead encountering Luo Tian—a star of doom.

"Huh?" Upon hearing Lin Xie's words, Ran Hao and the others were surprised. Honestly, they didn't believe Fire Lord would return; that sandstorm had been too terrifying.

Yet they hadn't expected Lin Xie's family patriarchs to change their attitude so quickly.

"Three of you, there's a master outside who wishes to meet you. Please speak well for us!" Lin Xie smiled sycophantically, addressing Ran Hao and Shao Honglang.

"Is it Fire Lord?" Upon hearing Lin Xie's words, Shao Honglang's face lit up with a flush of red, his eyes brightening.

"Are you still looking? Hurry and get the vice-palace masters out!" Lin Xie roared, recalling Luo Tian's time limit. His eyes flashed with anxiety.

"This place is nice; we're staying here, used to it!" Shao Honglang was shrewd. Though his strength hadn't improved in years, he noticed Lin Xie's anxiety and immediately understood.

"Vice-Palace Master, you..." Lin Xie knew he was anxious and that Shao Honglang had caught on. But there was no other way; they had to beg him.

"Quickly release the Shasha Palace people and Jiao family members!" Lin Xie spoke again, sighing inwardly. Fortunately, they hadn't completely eliminated the Jiao family and Shasha Palace people; if they had, that star of doom might have killed them all.

"Vice-Palace Master, we were mistaken; please forgive us and don't hold it against us. Let that person wait impatiently, we'll definitely re-pledge allegiance to Shasha Palace from today!" Lin Xie spoke loudly, as the half-bell time limit approached.

Shao Honglang didn't speak, still appearing lifeless and unmoving.

"Vice-Palace Master, we're willing to sacrifice our family's three years of income to get you out..." Lin Xie knew Shao Honglang was a cunning old man who wouldn't budge without seeing results.

Finally, Lin Xie and Chen family patriarchs paid a heavy price to get Shao Honglang, Ran Hao, and Jiao family's patriarch out of the dungeon.

Under Lin Xie's guidance, they arrived at the grand hall where Luo Tian had been waiting impatiently.

"Luo Tian!" Shao Honglang and Ran Hao gasped upon entering the hall, seeing Luo Tian with a cold expression.

They thought it was Fire Lord Meng Wushuang returning, but instead, it was Luo Tian. And seeing Lin Xie's group's demeanor, they realized the person referred to was Luo Tian.

"Shao elder, Ran Hao brother, Jiao family patriarch, it's been a while!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, but his eyes held killing intent as he gazed at Lin Xie and Chen family patriarchs.

"Eliminate the Li family completely; this matter is settled!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, making Lin Xie's group grimace. They knew that eliminating the Li family meant they had no path left; they could only follow Luo Tian.

"Are you unwilling?" But Luo Tian's cold voice made them grit their teeth, and they moved to slaughter within Shasha Palace.

"Three of you, tell me what happened!" Luo Tian was still confused and administered pills to the three. He urgently wanted to know about Gu Qianxue and Fire Lord's status.

"Sigh..." Shao Honglang sighed, beginning his account. However, he didn't know Fire Lord Meng Wushuang's current status; he only knew that the sandstorm was terrifying, beyond even an early-stage Immortal King's ability to withstand.

As for Shasha City's affairs, it was several sects coveting and supporting the Zhao family to become a puppet governor.

"Ziyang Sect, Feishen Sect, Jiling Sect..." The names of these sects echoed in Luo Tian's mind, his eyes flashing with killing intent.

"It was them!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with understanding. These sects were familiar; they were the ones that had attacked the Ascending Dragon Sect years ago. Luo Tian hadn't expected these sects to turn their eyes toward Shasha City.

Afterward, Luo Tian understood: those sects had failed to attack the Ascending Dragon Sect and nearly destroyed it, but they too suffered heavy losses. Even their sect masters had perished. Naturally, they needed resources to replenish.

Other sects were too bold to target; Fire Lord's absence made Shasha City the best choice.

"Ah... it was our fault; we didn't expect the Zhao family to attack so suddenly. Those two weren't here, and I was alone. If I had prepared, we wouldn't have ended up like this. Fire Lord did leave us some means!" Shao Honglang's face bore guilt. If it hadn't been for Luo Tian's sudden arrival, Shasha City might have truly become those sects' meal.

"Settle the old and new accounts together; this day isn't far!" Luo Tian sneered, retrieving his identity token to contact Ye Lianchen.

"What? You're in the Middle Three Heavens, why didn't you say earlier?" Ye Lianchen was overjoyed upon receiving Luo Tian's message.

Luo Tian, hearing Ye Lianchen's words, was momentarily stunned, unsure why Ye Lianchen was so eager.

"You don't know? You fell into the sea? Your uncle's furious; he's nearly gone mad. He mobilized all resources to find you, thinking you were dead. This has even reached our Star River Palace, making us search too!"

"Unexpectedly, you're still alive. I was heartbroken for a long time!" Ye Lianchen's voice carried excitement, causing Star River Palace disciples to be startled.

"Uh..."

"You let my father or Ye Chen send a message to your brother, please!" Luo Tian felt warm and sent the message.

"Shasha City, good. Need to bring people?"

"It doesn't matter; who in the Middle Three Heavens can't be bothered with you?" The two exchanged rapidly. Ye Lianchen also began preparing.

Luo Tian retrieved his identity token and addressed Shao Honglang: "I've been in Shasha Palace these days. Once my allies arrive, I'll enter the Death Desert to find Master Meng!"

Luo Tian didn't know that he had merely asked Ye Lianchen to bring two people, but he forgot that Ye Lianchen was proud and loved showing off. He also told Ye Wudao, who was delighted, and Ye Sheng also learned of the news.

Luo Tian's current status was no longer what it had been; he was a Disciplinary Hall Elder of Supplement Heaven Mountain, the younger brother of the Disciplinary Hall's Deputy Head Zhang Ziping. In recent times, Supplement Heaven Mountain had been active.

Ye Sheng knew Luo Tian held some grudge against him, but to eliminate the grudge, he allowed Ye Lianchen's antics. Soon, Star River Palace became chaotic; within an hour, a silver shuttle pierced the void and flew toward Shasha City.

Luo Tian remained in Shasha City, anxious but dared not leave. After all, he had destroyed the Zhao family and those sects' puppets; they might retaliate. Without him, Shao Honglang and Ran Hao couldn't handle it.

During these three days, Luo Tian's destruction of the Zhao family spread throughout Shasha City. People were stunned; they had thought the Zhao family would become Shasha City's new masters, but suddenly, the Zhao family was wiped out overnight.

"Luotian!" In a short time, this name became known to all factions in Shasha City. It was because of this person that the original Shasha Palace forces could reclaim control over Shasha City.

On the fourth morning, a thunderous sound echoed outside Shasha City as figures appeared at its gates. Their attire differed, clearly indicating they were from several sects.

"Shasha Palace, come out!" A commanding voice echoed, heavy energy causing sandstorms to swirl.

"Arrived?" Luo Tian smiled, showing no fear as he and Ran Hao stepped out of the hall.

Chapter 2355: Reinforcements

Shasha City, once bustling, was now eerily quiet. Its people kept their doors closed as figures converged toward it—Shasha City's original forces, the Jiao family, Lin family, and Chen family.

Luo Tian stood at the front of the crowd, leading Shasha City's forces toward its gates with a cold expression. Though his companions showed no fear, their hearts trembled; they were facing sects from the Middle Three Heavens. Fire Lord's absence made Luo Tian formidable, but he was still not an Immortal King.

They exited Shasha City's gates and saw the surrounding sects' figures, densely packed, blocking even the Death Desert's winds.

"Luo Tian! Again you!" Upon seeing Luo Tian and his group, the surrounding figures' faces darkened. Their gazes locked onto him with hostility.

"Yes, it's me!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, scanning the group. He found no Immortal Kings, only a few Half-Step Immortal Kings. His smile deepened.

"Luo Tian! You're the Ascending Dragon Sect's Disciple. Why do you interfere in Shasha City?" A middle-aged man roared, his voice filled with anger. They had heard news that Luo Tian was no longer the same—his background was deep.

"Mind your own business! What do you want?" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his tone resolute.

"You..." The Half-Step Immortal Kings' faces darkened but they dared not act rashly. They had once attacked the Ascending Dragon Sect because Star River Palace was in turmoil, but now it had recovered.

"Luo Tian, today Shasha City will fall. Can you withstand our thousands of troops?" A middle-aged man spoke, the new sect master of Ziyang Sect. He had been elevated to Half-Step Immortal King through resources, named Tian Yong.

"Let's make a bet to avoid fighting!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, gazing at the sect leaders. At this moment, Ye Lianchen's group hadn't arrived yet; Shasha City's people weren't a match for the sects' combined forces. Even with Luo Tian, he couldn't protect everyone.

"How to bet?" The leaders' gazes showed surprise; they didn't know what Luo Tian was up to.

"I'll fight you alone. If I win, you leave; if I lose, Shasha City is yours." Luo Tian spoke softly. He knew they would accept; after all, they had four Half-Step Immortal Kings.

"Arrogant!" Everyone's thoughts echoed this, even Ran Hao and Shao Honglang. But now they had no choice but to rely on Luo Tian, so they said nothing.

"Why should we bet with you? We have a million troops!" Tian Yong spoke, knowing Luo Tian had once defeated a Half-Step Immortal King with his True Immortal peak strength in the Ascending Dragon Sect battle.

"Then it's one fight!" Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the Half-Step Immortal Kings. Once they fought, he had to kill them all to avoid heavy losses.

"Luo Tian, you still have ten breaths to leave. If you don't go, and if you're injured or killed, it's your own fault!" The Jiling Sect master roared, his voice cold.

"Only one fight; when you die, it's not my fault!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, gazing at the sect masters.

"Ten... nine... eight..." As he spoke, the Jiling Sect master shouted.

"Bang..." Just as the Jiling Sect master began speaking, space trembled. A silver light rose and a silver shuttle pierced the void, appearing in view.

"Arrived!" Luo Tian's face lit up with a smile as he spoke softly.

"It's the Starlight Shuttle, from Star River Palace!" Tian Yong and others gasped, their eyes wide with disbelief. They naturally recognized Star River Palace's treasure.

"Who dares to touch my brother? Ask Ye Lianchen first!" A loud, arrogant voice echoed through the heavens as a figure rushed out of the shuttle. Dressed in fine robes, it was none other than Ye Lianchen.

"Ye Lianchen!" Tian Yong and others gasped, watching Ye Lianchen and Luo Tian embrace fiercely.

"Haha, Brother Tian, you're still so handsome! Though slightly inferior to me!" Ye Lianchen laughed loudly, his eyes filled with excitement.

"Bang..." As Ye Lianchen's words ended, the shuttle trembled again. Figures emerged from it, all clad in Star River Palace attire.

"Ten... a hundred... ten thousand..." Ten thousand people stood neatly, their bodies radiating cold energy.

"This..." Luo Tian's face finally changed; he had anticipated Ye Lianchen would show off and bring people, but he hadn't expected so many. Moreover, these people held a special identity within Star River Palace—the Iron Blood Hall.

The leader was none other than the Iron Blood Hall's Grandmaster, Ye Tian, with Ye Chen standing behind him.

"Such a big favor..." Luo Tian mused internally; he hadn't expected Ye Tian to be convinced by Ye Lianchen to come here for mischief.

"Ye... Ye Tian..." Upon seeing Ye Tian, the sect masters' faces paled immediately. Even standing there, Ye Tian made them feel inferior in aura.

Ten thousand Iron Blood Hall disciples of Star River Palace—each was elite. Though the sects had more people, they were no match for these ten thousand Iron Blood Hall disciples.

"Come on, old man, come here!" Ye Lianchen shouted arrogantly. Now that he was Star River Palace's de facto Grandmaster and a Half-Step Immortal King, he no longer needed to feign being a纨绔. Yet Ye Lianchen had become addicted to this role, remaining the same for years and having grown accustomed to it.

Shasha City's people watched Ye Lianchen shouting wildly, not expecting Luo Tian to have such power.

"Ye Lianchen, Disciple of the Star River Palace—what wind blew you here?" Tian Yong and others smiled, addressing Ye Lianchen.

If it were just Ye Lianchen, they could have ignored him and taken Shasha City. But with Ye Tian and the ten thousand Iron Blood Hall disciples, their pressure was too strong. Plus, Shasha City's native forces meant they would suffer heavy losses if they took it.

Moreover, killing ten thousand Iron Blood Hall disciples was no small matter; Star River Palace would surely be enraged. They couldn't afford it.

"Today, I'll single-handedly block your thousands of troops. If you want to enter Shasha City, step over my corpse!" Ye Lianchen roared, standing before the sects.

"Shameless..." Luo Tian felt embarrassed; he could clearly see that the sects were intimidated by Ye Tian and the Iron Blood Hall.

"..." Upon hearing Ye Lianchen's words, Tian Yong and others were speechless but dared not retaliate.

"Today will be a legendary tale! I, alone, blocked several major sects' thousands of troops. My king's aura subdued everything!" Ye Lianchen boasted self-consciously.

"Leave now, and I'll let it go!" Yet Ye Lianchen's face turned cold as he gazed at Tian Yong and others.

"This..." Upon hearing Ye Lianchen's words, the group was momentarily stunned, their resolve shaken by his aura. They were now in a bind—fighting might not be feasible, and they couldn't afford to lose this prime target.

"Luo Tian, did you mean your words?" One sect master's eyes flickered as he spoke.

"Shameless!" The people of Shasha City roared, upset that Luo Tian had proposed a bet but now they had the advantage and brought it up again.

"Why should I bet with you?" Luo Tian's face showed disdain as he gazed at the sect masters, speaking softly.

Luo Tian's words made the sect masters' faces flush red; they had just responded to Luo Tian, and now this statement was returned to them.

"Ten breaths—leave or fight!" Ye Tian's face finally showed impatience, his cold words making the situation awkward.

The sect masters exchanged glances before sighing deeply. They knew they couldn't gain anything today and prepared to retreat.

"However, if you truly want to bet, I can consider it!" As the sect masters prepared their orders, Luo Tian's playful voice echoed.

"Huh?" Everyone was momentarily stunned, focusing on Luo Tian. Anyone could see that the sects were about to leave, and Luo Tian had no need to respond.

"Bet with your lives—fate is in your hands!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, gazing at the sect masters. His icy words made them shiver.
