Wang Heng was naturally a sword master, deeply attuned to the blade. His weapon, named Ghost Soul Sword, was an upper-tier ghostly artifact gifted by his father, the King of Ghosts. Yet, when he had employed the technique of Human-Sword Unification, he had been repelled by Luo Tian. Instantly, Wang Heng understood that Luo Tian's Dragon Abyss was truly a superior sword—far surpassing his own Ghost Soul Sword.

Chapter 2137: Keep Calling, Then!

A powerful force instantly sent the women flying. Some tumbled to the ground in disarray, while others were caught by male disciples of the Wheel Rotation Sect, who took advantage to grope them.

Fu Xingxuan stood coldly, watching the female disciples with a sneer. "Normal combat injuries are natural. What are you doing?" she asked.

These brainwashed women, infatuated with Wang Heng, felt his pain. Luo Tian now bore nearly a hundred wounds, though not fatal; his formidable physique was rapidly healing them, leaving only faint scars and bloodstains. Yet Fu Xingxuan's heart ached at the sight.

Seeing these brainwashed women attempt to attack Luo Tian, Fu Xingxuan would not allow it. If they pushed further, she would not hesitate to kill a few to establish the Saintess's authority.

Fu Xingxuan's authoritative voice made the female disciples hesitate, but their eyes still brimmed with concern as they gazed at Wang Heng, crushed beneath Luo Tian's foot.

"Brilliant! That really feels satisfying. I've always disliked this little pretty boy!" Wang Gang and others laughed, their eyes on Luo Tian.

"Deserved it!" The male disciples of the Wheel Rotation Sect also wore expressions of schadenfreude, watching Wang Heng.

Though they disliked Luo Tian, compared to Wang Heng, he had only flirted with Su Dan. They knew Su Dan was never theirs. Wang Heng, however, had flirted with a group of female disciples—this was what left them hopeless.

"Ah……"

"Release Wang Senior immediately!" The female disciples screamed, hurling vicious words at Luo Tian, which made him smirk.

"Let me go!" Wang Heng's eyes flashed with humiliation as he roared, struggling to break free—but it was no use.

"Buzz…" The sword's edge swept across his face, carving a gash. Blood immediately flowed from Wang Heng's cheek.

"Ah……" Wang Heng cried out, though the wound was not severe. This gash marred his handsome face.

"Luo Chen, may you die a miserable death!" The female disciples cried out in heartbreak, but dared not approach.

"Now, every time you shout, I'll carve another line on his face!" Luo Tian smiled, waving his hand. Another streak of blood flashed.

"My handsome face!" Wang Heng roared, but still could not rise. He howled wildly.

The screams from the crowd rose again, curses against Luo Tian echoing, adding another gash to Wang Heng's face. Yet still, some screamed instinctively, forcing Luo Tian to carve more gashes.

"Stop screaming! Don't scream!" Wang Heng's heart bled, feeling these female disciples were not trying to save him but to harm him.

Time passed slowly. The female disciples finally ceased their cries, gazing at Wang Heng, now drenched in blood, too afraid to utter a sound.

"Come on, keep screaming! Who dares scream again?" Luo Tian bellowed, eyes filled with disdain as he gazed at the silent brainwashed female disciples of the Wheel Rotation Sect.

"That's better."

"Remember this: if I see you scream again, I'll beat him every time I meet him!" Seeing no one spoke further, Luo Tian sneered and addressed Wang Heng: "Surrender? Hand over your storage ring!"

"Here it is!" Wang Heng nearly fainted, handing his storage ring to Luo Tian's hand. His heart felt like bleeding.

Though this ring was not his sole asset, it contained considerable resources—deeply painful to part with.

"I don't trust you!" Luo Tian pinched the ring, and it exploded in his hand.

"Crash…" A pile of items fell onto the battlefield. Countless ghost crystals formed a mountain, alongside rare herbs from hell. On top of these piles of ghost crystals lay a single lotus flower.

"Such a little pretty boy, yet so rich!" Qiu Long and others marveled, gazing at the mountain of ghost crystals.

"What's that?" Soon after, they noticed scrolls hanging there.

"Don't!" Wang Heng's face darkened instantly. He struggled, but Luo Tian held him firmly underfoot.

"Shameless! So shameless!" Seeing the scrolls, some female disciples covered their eyes. Male disciples gaped.

Most of these scrolls depicted women in the nude, lifelike and capturing moments after intimacy.

"Wang Xiuzhi, 36 years old... Dou Xiaoe..." The names of these women were listed beside the scrolls, totaling hundreds.

"Did he really harm all these women? So many?" Qiu Long and others' faces turned contemptuous.

"Wait, those scrolls aren't drawn—they're made of human skin!" Someone gasped, eyes burning with anger at Wang Heng.

Though killing in hell was common, Wang Heng's method was too cruel. These women had admired him; he'd killed them and turned their bodies into human-skin scrolls—unforgivable.

"Disgusting, pervert!" Someone cursed. Female disciples gazed at Wang Heng in bewilderment, instinctively shivering before their eyes widened with disbelief.

"This is impossible! Wang Heng Senior was so perfect. How could he do such a thing!" Female disciples screamed again, as if their faith crumbled.

"It's definitely a setup! It must be a setup!" Many female disciples shook their heads, unwilling to believe Wang Heng was such a disgusting pervert.

"Ugh…" Luo Tian was momentarily stunned, then his eyes flared with fury. He pointed a finger, burning the scrolls. His gaze was filled with killing intent toward Wang Heng.

Yet Luo Tian restrained himself—Wang Heng's identity was too sensitive. If he killed Wang Heng, it would bring his father's wrath; Luo Tian could not withstand that.

"Luo Chen!" Wang Heng roared, his aura surging. If Luo Tian did not release him, he would expend his final secret and fight to the death.

"Go down!" Luo Tian kicked Wang Heng off the battlefield. Then he waved his hand, collecting Wang Heng's astonishing wealth.

"Scum! Scoundrel!" Curses echoed through the crowd. Though there were curses, no one dared to act. One could imagine Wang Heng's name would be tainted in the Wheel Rotation Sect from today.

Wang Heng was kicked off the battlefield, yet many female disciples gathered around him. Some even wept.

"Wang Heng Senior, are you alright? You're injured so badly!" Female disciples gazed at him with concern. They glared fiercely at Luo Tian but dared not curse aloud.

"Wang Heng Senior is so perfect. These seductive sluts offered themselves willingly. It's an honor for them to be turned into scrolls!" Female disciples surrounding Wang Heng shouted.

Of course, this was only a minority. Most female disciples were more清醒, as if waking from a dream, their gaze toward Wang Heng now cold.

"These brainwashed ones are hopeless..." Luo Tian sighed, shaking his head. He gazed at the remaining three little kings.

With Wang Heng defeated, only three remained: the son of the God-King, Mota; the son of the Heaven-Ghost King, Duan Boyang; and the son of the Sealed Ghost King, Mo Cheng.

"I'll skip this..." Mo Cheng chuckled, shaking his head. Luo Tian had defeated the previous three; he knew his strength. If they fought fiercely, Mo Cheng would not fear Luo Tian. But in this battlefield combat, it was somewhat restricted.

Duan Boyang also hesitated. They had all looked down on Luo Tian, but he had defeated three in a row—this made them fear him deeply.

"I'll go!" As Duan Boyang hesitated, Mota leapt into the air, standing on the battlefield. His face bore confidence.

"Come on!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at Mota. Upon seeing his eyes, Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly.

"Four-eyed monster!" But then Luo Tian exclaimed loudly, his voice clear to all.

"Haha…" As Luo Tian's words finished, laughter erupted. People gazed at Mota, whose two eyes overlapped.

"I hadn't expected the famed Moon Eclipse Eyes to be called a four-eyed monster. Indeed, it's quite fitting!" Qiu Long laughed.

"You dare to die!" Mota's face darkened instantly. He soared into the air, rushing toward Luo Tian. As he spoke, a long sword appeared in his hand.

"Buzz…" The blade's aura descended like a crescent moon, pure white. It instantly appeared above Luo Tian's head.

"Return!" Luo Tian laughed, spinning his sword and slicing the blade's aura. Thunderous sound erupted from their collision. Mota's body reversed, his gaze filled with seriousness.

"Luo Chen, dare you not use this sword?" Mota shouted, his voice filled with contempt.

"Ah, I hadn't thought that this sword was his key to victory!"

"If he didn’t have this凶剑, his strength would at least drop by half!" Others' eyes lit with understanding, then regret.

"Why? It's not that I don't want to put it down. If I did, you wouldn’t have a chance to win!" Luo Tian spoke lightly, his voice filled with contempt.

"Stubborn argument!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, people felt this thought.

"This sword was your bet. According to the rules, it shouldn't be considered as your means but should have been put into the bet together!" Mota chuckled, gazing at Luo Tian.

"I truly can't let go of this sword. If I did, there would be no fight!" Luo Tian still wore an unwilling expression toward Dragon Abyss.

Chapter 2138: Moon Eclipse Eyes

"Enough talk. You're cheating, it's unfair!" Mota sneered, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Are you really saying I shouldn't use this sword?" Luo Tian's eyes glimmered with a smile. He hadn’t expected Mota to make such a request.

"Prove it by not using it!" Mota replied, believing Luo Tian was reluctant to part with Dragon Abyss since the sword was terrifying.

Previously, when Luo Tian fought Wang Heng, it was entirely due to Dragon Abyss's power. He had defeated Wang Heng of the second sword realm with his first.

"Fine, I'll grant your wish!" Luo Tian chuckled, placing Dragon Abyss on his back. He gazed at Wang Heng.

"Begin!" Mota saw Luo Tian had placed Dragon Abyss and felt no issue. His hands moved swiftly, a long sword appearing in his hand.

"Buzz…" Next moment, Mota rushed toward Luo Tian with the sword. His eyes gleamed with excitement.

"Without Dragon Abyss, I still have other treasures!" Luo Tian waved his hand. The Rending Sky Spear appeared in his grip, clashing with Mota's long sword.

Both retreated. Luo Tian took a deep breath. Mota also looked at Luo Tian with seriousness, surprised that without Dragon Abyss, Luo Tian was still so strong.

"Again!" Luo Tian roared. The spear surged like a dragon, black cold light spreading around him, forming a storm of darkness that swept toward Mota.

"Buzz…" Mota's eyes narrowed. The cold light flickered, and he vanished from sight.

Next moment, Mota appeared on Luo Tian's other side. The black storm seemed to be cut open.

"Poof…" A gash appeared on Luo Tian's chest. His body froze, his face surprised.

"Fast sword!"

"And he found my weakness!" Luo Tian muttered. He gazed at Mota standing there.

"Without that凶剑, his strength has indeed dropped!" Qiu Long and others spoke. They watched Mota standing there.

"Moon Eclipse Eyes can find the boy's weakness, combined with Mota’s fast sword. This boy's strength has also dropped. It seems it's over. Regretful that this凶剑 fell into Mota’s hands!" They wore expressions of admiration.

"Go on, Mota Senior! Kill Luo Chen and avenge Wang Heng!" The brainwashed female disciples' faces lit up, shouting at Mota.

"Get lost!" Mota heard the female disciples’ words and suddenly turned. His eyes glowed with silver light, shouting at them.

Upon hearing Mota's words, the female disciples fell silent. They feared Mota would descend to trouble them. Indeed, Mota's brutality was infamous in the Wheel Rotation Sect.

"You have no chance. Without that凶剑, you're nothing!" Mota sneered and soared into the air, slashing again.

Blade light flickered. Luo Tian hadn’t found the long sword’s movement trajectory, and another wound appeared on his body.

"Brilliant!" Luo Tian soared into the air, creating distance. He cautiously gazed at Mota, surprised by Mota's strength.

"Give up! Your flesh is strong, but it can't endure!" Cold voice echoed. Mota rushed toward Luo Tian again, slicing with his long sword.

"Think you're lucky! I haven't shown my strength yet. You want to fly?" Luo Tian ignored the blade's aura and controlled the Rending Sky Spear, three spear images merging to sweep toward Mota.

"Ah?" Mota's face slightly changed. His eyes flashed with cruelty and still slashed toward Luo Tian’s chest.

Blood light flickered. Luo Tian's chest spewed a stream of blood, a white wound appearing on his chest, blood flowing out. Flesh peeled back.

"Crack…" On the other side, the Rending Sky Spear also swept across Mota's chest. Mota spat out a large amount of blood.

Mota’s body flew back nearly a hundred feet before stopping. His chest caved in, his face pale.

"Brutal! He exchanged injuries. But this was the best method; otherwise, with Mota’s fast sword, he would have no chance!"

"Right. His flesh could match Qiu Long’s. This attack didn’t cost him," True Immortal Peak elders said, admiration in their eyes as they gazed at Luo Tian standing there.

"Ah cough…" Mota spat blood, his body slowly stood up. His gaze also looked at Luo Tian.

"Good thinking to come up with this method!" Mota chuckled, his chest emitting a crackling sound. He stood straight.

"You're not bad either. You wounded my flesh!" Luo Tian's chest wound emitted black qi, a cold sweat trickled down his face.

"Seems I need to use real strength!" Mota switched hands, gripping the long sword. He gazed at Luo Tian.

"Senior Mota has been using his left hand!" The Wheel Rotation Sect disciples' faces showed shock, watching Mota standing there.

"He's serious. Only when fighting Wang Gang did Mota use his right hand!"

"Using the right hand, Mota's sword speed increases by more than double. That means, before Mota’s blade reaches Luo Tian, his blade has already reached Luo Tian!" Wang Gang and others looked serious. Mota was arrogant but had the capital to be so.

"Again!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. He rushed toward Mota, activating the King of Kings' combat method and the Ghostly Steps.

"Useless. You can't stop it!" Mota sneered, turning his blade and slashing.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before Mota. But before he could attack, the blade's aura was already in front of him—no chance to react.

"Poof…" Blood light flickered again. Another deep wound appeared on Luo Tian's chest, intersecting with previous wounds—terrifying.

"Speed is still no good. Moon Eclipse Eyes can find the attack's weakness and match my speed!" Hong Tao sighed longingly. Among the eight little kings, he feared Mota most.

"Ugh…" Luo Tian panted. He gazed at Mota standing still, a smile on his face.

"No chance. Give up!" Mota shook his head, gazing at Dragon Abyss on Luo Tian's back.

"I guess I need to be serious now!" Luo Tian smiled, gently removing Dragon Abyss.

"Are you retracting your words?" Mota's face slightly changed upon seeing Luo Tian remove Dragon Abyss. He scolded.

"No, I said not to use this sword. Naturally, I won't employ it!" Luo Tian chuckled, placing the long sword on the ground.

"Buzz…"煞气 immediately spread from Dragon Abyss. However, the battlefield emitted a battle spirit, suppressing the scattered煞气.

"Good. One hour should be enough!" Luo Tian gazed at Dragon Abyss standing there, his eyes showing joy. He hadn’t expected the battlefield to suppress some of Dragon Abyss's煞气.

Cold air swept across the battlefield. Though most was suppressed, it still made Mota tremble slightly.

"Then what? Without that凶剑, you're nothing in our eyes!" Mota shook his head, face filled with contempt.

"I'll attack again!" Luo Tian chuckled, soared into the air. He rushed toward Mota.

"Boom…" The ultimate true immortal's suppression of true immortality fully erupted. Luo Tian seemed to change, with three-tenths of his cultivation restored. He had fully recovered to his strongest state.

His formidable flesh glowed with divine laws, wounds rapidly healing. He transformed into a human-shaped dragon and rushed toward Mota.

"This…" Mota's face instantly changed. His eyes held disbelief. In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before him and punched his chest.

"Crack…" A crackling sound echoed. Mota's body flew back, crashing into the barrier. His eyes held shock as he gazed at Luo Tian standing there with overwhelming power.

"How is this possible!" Everyone gasped, disbelievingly rubbing their eyes. They watched Luo Tian standing there with a smile.

"I said, if I truly put down this sword, you really have no fight!" Luo Tian chuckled, walking toward Mota.

"His strength is so strong. It's increased so much!"

"He was hiding his strength all along. Dead man!" The eight little kings' faces changed, not expecting Luo Tian to have this move.

Mota stood up. His body swayed slightly. He wiped his mouth's blood, gazing at Luo Tian.

In that moment, both speed and strength had increased significantly. He couldn't react in time.

"Is this your true strength?" Mota chuckled, his eyes radiating divine light.

"It's rare. I haven't met anyone who could push me this far!" Mota whispered, his eyes beginning to flicker. Two silver glows erupted from his eyes.

Those two overlapping pupils began to merge, eventually turning entirely silver. His gaze at Luo Tian gave him a sense of fear.

"Here it is, the Moon Eclipse Eyes!"

"Few people can force Mota to use his Moon Eclipse Eyes!" Seeing Mota's silver eyes, Wang Gang and others wore anticipation.

"What's the difference with these eyes?" Luo Tian soared into the air, his body moving swiftly toward Mota. He became a black line.

Chapter 2139: Repel

Chapter 2139: Repel

Luo Tian's speed was extremely fast. In a thunderous roar, he appeared before Mota. Three fists suddenly merged and smashed toward Mota.

Mota remained calm, watching Luo Tian rush to his front. His eyes glowed with silver light and he also punched.

"Buzz…" To Luo Tian's shock, two afterimages appeared before Mota. It had a sense of chaos and disorder, though not as strong as Luo Tian's, but still formidable.

"Boom…" Thunderous sound echoed. Mota's body flew back, spitting blood. But after stopping his body, he stepped forward and rushed toward Luo Tian with a slash of his sword. His speed was extremely fast.

Luo Tian's eyes showed shock. The Rending Sky Spear hummed and met the descending blade, while another fist collided with Mota.

This time both were evenly matched. Though Luo Tian could keep up with Mota's blade speed, he was still on the defensive. Moreover, Mota's punches were stronger than before.

Boom boom boom...

They exchanged blows continuously. Each collision caused the sky to tremble.

"Mota is being suppressed!" The Wheel Rotation Sect disciples' faces showed shock, gazing at the two fighting.

"A temporary suppression. Mota is observing Luo Tian's methods! When he retaliates, it will be a storm of rain. Mota’s retaliation is precisely when Luo Tian has exhausted all his methods!" Wang Gang said with admiration.

Others nodded as well. The most terrifying part of Mota was his Moon Eclipse Eyes and that fast sword, both combined making it unbeatable.

The Moon Eclipse Eyes could detect the opponent's weakness. The fast sword was unpredictable. They knew Mota's most terrifying ability was his capacity to quickly learn the opponent’s martial arts through the Moon Eclipse Eyes.

"Boom…" Luo Tian used his Left Hand's Divine King Nine Heavens Map and Right Hand's Intercepting Heaven Seal. Thunderous sound erupted as he soared toward Mota again.

Silver patterns flickered. Mota smiled slightly, pointing a finger. He pressed against both martial arts and clashed with Luo Tian again. Being able to quickly find Luo Tian's weakness allowed Mota to remain undefeated.

Luo Tian gradually felt some unease. He sensed something was off with Mota's eyes and became cautious.

Time passed slowly. Half a moment had already passed, but Luo Tian found he could no longer suppress Mota.

"Why didn't you use that method of turning into a giant?" Mota smiled, clashing with Luo Tian. His body reversed.

"I understand!" Seeing Mota's reversed body, Luo Tian felt a familiar aura. Mota had used the Ghostly Steps.

"He actually learned my martial arts!" Luo Tian was shocked. He gazed at Mota, recalling an enemy from the Nine Domains who had also possessed this ability. Time was too long; he had forgotten who it was.

"It can only be used once, otherwise he'll learn it!" Luo Tian's eyes showed contemplation. Then his eyes lit with understanding.

"So be it!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with divine light. He sighed inwardly, grateful he had awakened early. If all were learned by Mota, he would have no threat against him.

"Manifesting the Divine King!" Luo Tian's hands moved continuously, hand seals flying from his hands.

"Divine King! Heaven and Earth!" Mota also moved his fingers rapidly. His body emitted a massive aura.

"Boom…" In people's shock, both bodies rose simultaneously and transformed into giants of a thousand zhang in height.

"This is the second time he has seen my Divine King! Therefore, he could learn it!" Luo Tian muttered. He took a large step forward and crushed Mota with his foot, the蛮七踏.

"Another new technique?" Mota smiled. He punched repeatedly against the descending foot.

Thunderous sound echoed. Mota's body continuously retreated, his massive form colliding with the barrier.

"Lingyu Ghost Claws!" Luo Tian moved his hands, pressing into the void. A black ghost claw extended from the sky and smashed toward Mota.

"Ghost Night Palm!" Mota pressed his hand, a black hand covering the sky. It smashed toward the black ghost claw.

"Boom…" The black hand was torn apart by the ghost claw. It smashed onto Mota's massive body, exploding.

"Have another go!" Mota spat blood. Luo Tian's attack was too fierce; Mota had already suffered heavy injuries.

"One last move. If you can block it, I'll have another!" Luo Tian smiled.

"Roar…" A roar echoed. Black qi surged from Luo Tian's hands, dense black qi instantly filling the sky like a cloud.

"Boom…" Next moment, a thick foot emerged from the black cloud. The heavy pressure made everyone stunned.

A black elephant stepped out of the dark cloud, crushing Mota. The elephant carried pressure unique to ghost cultivators and ghosts.

"I can't deduce the hand seals!" Mota's face changed. His silver moon-like eyes could not deduce Luo Tian's hand seals.

"Roar…" After the elephant came a black dragon. One, two, four dragons and four elephants crushed the heavens, shaking all.

"Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison!" Luo Tian pressed his hand into the void. Four dragons and four elephants thundered toward Mota.

"Month Eclipse!" Mota roared, his silver eyes suddenly turned black. The entire world seemed to fall into endless darkness.

Boom boom boom...

Eight booms echoed in people's ears, causing strong shock. The battle spirit-filled barrier trembled violently. Terror energy seemed to burst through the barrier, black qi rolling and obscuring people's vision.

"What was the result?" Including several little kings and many elders, all wore shock on their faces.

Fu Xingxuan stood in the sky. Her lips slightly curled, her eyes showing a smile.

The storm calmed. Black qi gradually dissipated from people's sight. A figure stood there, Luo Tian with a smile and panting.

"I lost!" Mota spoke. His face was pale, gazing at Luo Tian. His eyes returned to normal. Two tears of blood appeared on Mota's face.

Mota had resisted two dragons and two elephants. Then he was crushed by the remaining two dragons and two elephants. Though his Moon Eclipse Eyes were powerful, they could not defy fate. Some martial arts he couldn’t find the weakness in time and learn them. Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison was taught by Longque to Luo Tian.

"Mo Tian also lost!" Female disciples gazed at Luo Tian standing there. The entire battlefield was silent.

"Who's next? Su Dan, Wang Gang and Mo Cheng didn't participate. Four of the eight little kings have been defeated. Only Duan Boyang remains!" Many disciples gazed at Duan Boyang standing there.

Luo Tian panted. He flew to the trembling Dragon Abyss and grabbed it, gazing at Mota: "I said, without this sword, you really have no fight!"

Luo Tian surveyed the crowd. His eyes showed a hint of weakness. Finally, his gaze fell on Duan Boyang, with a glint of killing intent.

This glance made Duan Boyang's heart quake. His face turned completely grim.

"He wants to kill me!" Duan Boyang muttered, seeing Luo Tian's unhidden killing intent. His eyes showed contemplation.

Duan Boyang was indeed afraid. Luo Tian had defeated four people in a row, making Duan Boyang fearful. Though he used poison and unleashed it all to kill an advanced true immortal.

But Duan Boyang wasn't sure if Luo Tian had more secrets. The Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison made him feel shocked. He could sense that if they fought, it would be a fight to the death. He wasn't confident.

"You are severely injured and have fought continuously. I don’t want to take advantage of your situation. I won't participate!" Duan Boyang spoke softly, shaking his head.

"Duan Boyang Senior isn’t fighting!" Upon hearing Duan Boyang's words, the Wheel Rotation Sect disciples' faces showed disbelief. Though Duan Boyang spoke politely, they felt something was off in his words.

"Haha! Duan Boyang actually backed down!"

"Such a coward, really a wimp!" Qiu Long and others sneered. They gazed at Duan Boyang, eyes filled with contempt.

"Backed down!" Upon hearing Qiu Long's words, the Wheel Rotation Sect disciples also erupted in chaos. They gazed at Duan Boyang with disbelief, not expecting the proud Duan Boyang to back down.

"I’m fine. Though I was injured, I can still kill you!" Luo Tian chuckled, gazing at Duan Boyang.

"It’s not that I don’t want to take advantage of your situation!" Duan Boyang muttered inwardly. But the more Luo Tian did this, the more he feared him.

"That’s not acceptable. I’ve bet a lot of ghost crystals. If you don’t fight, how do we calculate it? Come on and let me kill you!" Luo Tian replied, still强势.

"You!" Duan Boyang's face darkened. He stared at Luo Tian with a fierce gaze, his aura slowly rising.

Their gazes met. Duan Boyang finally chose to avoid battle and soared into the air, flying toward the entrance of the ninety-eighth level.

"Running…" The Wheel Rotation Sect disciples' faces showed shock. They watched Duan Boyang fly away, and the crowd erupted.

"Alright, that's it for today!" Luo Tian shook his head. As long as Duan Boyang remained in the Wheel Rotation Sect, he had plenty of opportunities to eliminate him.

Chapter 2140: Curtain Call

The crowd erupted. Disciples of the Wheel Rotation Sect gazed at Luo Tian descending from the battlefield.

"From today, Luo Chen's name will surely shine in the Wheel Rotation Sect!" Everyone felt this sentiment.

"One person fought four little kings, defeating them one by one. Though he didn’t say it was eight in a row, three chose not to fight. The son of the Heaven-Ghost King, Duan Boyang, was scared off and backed down. Who else could achieve this?"

"Only the Saintess Fu Xingxuan could do it in the entire Wheel Rotation Sect. And Fu Xingxuan could suppress them because her cultivation was at the advanced true immortal level and she controlled the battlefield!" People whispered among themselves.

Reverence—reverence for a strong person. At this moment, Luo Tian's status equaled the eight little kings and even surpassed them.

"My bet!" However, as a series of lamentations arose, people's faces turned grim.

"That was my life savings! It all vanished!"

"Damn it!" Ma Elder and other elders' faces were pale. They had also bet heavily, expecting Luo Tian to make them bankrupt.

"Haha! Fortune favors the bold. I actually won!" Several voices of joy echoed in the crowd. These people had bet on Luo Tian's victory, and their bets multiplied tenfold.

"Regretful! I wish I had bet everything!" Disciples' faces showed regret, lamenting they had bet too little.

Zhang Tianhe and Ye Chen stood among the crowd. Their faces showed no excitement, as they had indeed won but essentially lost.

The entire Wheel Rotation Sect disciples' assets were a terrifying number. They had eaten all of it, and according to the rules, they should have been speechless with excitement.

But Su Dan had bet three hundred lotus flowers before Luo Tian fought Wang Heng, Hong Tao, and Mota. Each bet one hundred lotus flowers—this was too much for them to afford.

"Played for nothing. Maybe I'll have to pay more..." Their faces showed bitterness as they watched Luo Tian walking toward them from the battlefield.

"Luo Senior, if you have time, come visit me!" Wang Gang spoke first, smiling. He had originally intended to help Luo Tian out of trouble.
