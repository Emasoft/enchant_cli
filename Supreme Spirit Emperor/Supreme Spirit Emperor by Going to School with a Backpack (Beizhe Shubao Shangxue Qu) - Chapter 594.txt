Clad in a flowing gray robe, his long hair cascading like water, he sat there. Ye Wudao and his brother Ye Tian sat across from the youth, their gazes alight with amusement.

"Xiaotian, this is Si Ma Feiying from Mount Supreme Heaven. He is a friend of Lord Jiang Yuzhe, just like you—originally given a Supreme Heaven Seal by the young master!" Ye Wudao smiled, addressing Luo Tian, causing the latter's heart to tremble slightly. The Supreme Heaven Seal—Luo Tian knew of it. Jiang Yuzhe had once given him one, but in the end, it was taken by Jiang Yuzhe's elder brother, Jiang Yuwen.

This was a profound humiliation for Luo Tian, who had long concealed this disgrace within his heart. Now that he possessed the means to reclaim what was rightfully his, he would do so—not for Jiang Yuzhe, but for himself. Yet Luo Tian also knew that his so-called means were nothing to Mount Supreme Heaven, and even now in Star River Prefecture, he was but a disciple, his life hanging by a thread at Ye Sheng's whim. This Si Ma Feiying was clearly no ordinary man; to be entrusted with a Supreme Heaven Seal by Jiang Yuzhe indicated exceptional prowess. After all, even Jiang Yuzhe could only bestow three Supreme Heaven Seals—one to Luo Tian, one to Jiang Huantian, and the final one to Si Ma Feiying.

"Uncle Si, what brings you to Star River Prefecture?" Luo Tian smiled, bowing respectfully to Si Ma Feiying.

"Take you to Mount Supreme Heaven!" Si Ma Feiying cast a glance at Luo Tian, his expression laced with arrogance as he spoke.

Si Ma Feiying was puzzled why Jiang Yuzhe had gifted a Supreme Heaven Seal to Luo Tian. In his view, one who could lose a Supreme Heaven Seal was of no consequence.

"Master Jiang Yuzhe requires assistance. Go, Tian'er. You've mentioned wanting to visit the Upper Three Heavens before—why not do so now?" Ye Wudao smiled, addressing Luo Tian. Over these days, Luo Tian had repeatedly mentioned wanting to visit the Upper Three Heavens, but Ye Wudao had suppressed it. Now that Jiang Yuzhe himself had sent an envoy, Ye Wudao could not refuse and thus allowed Luo Tian to go.

"Yes!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Ye Wudao, regardless of everything, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian had treated him kindly.

"Remember, this place will always be your support. If you face trouble on Mount Supreme Heaven, send me a message!" Ye Wudao spoke softly. Ye Sheng's actions had caused Luo Tian to harbor resentment toward Star River Prefecture, a fact Ye Wudao could perceive. Yet he had no choice—between his elder brother and his adopted son, he could not favor one. He could only strive to mediate.

"Yes, thank you, Uncle Ye!" Luo Tian chuckled lightly and did not dwell on it. In his eyes, Star River Prefecture had always shown him kindness, and Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen were his brothers. He would not ignore their plight, even if he lacked strength at present.

"Very well, go say your farewells to Liangchen!" Ye Wudao sighed deeply. These past days, Star River Prefecture had finally stabilized.

"Uncle Si, please wait a moment. I must bid farewell to my friends before leaving with you!" Luo Tian chuckled, then turned and exited the hall. Outside the hall, the Dark Demon Eight Guardians stood at the entrance, their gazes cautious.

"Each of you has three choices: leave me now and become free men, continue to follow me, or remain in Star River Prefecture by Liangchen's side!" Luo Tian addressed the eight men, speaking softly.

"Whatever your command, Master..." Ghost One to Ghost Eight furrowed their brows slightly before bowing in unison.

"Very well," Luo Tian nodded, patting Ghost One's shoulder. He understood the eight men's choice and strode toward Ye Liangchen's residence.

As he walked, Luo Tian felt a sense of nostalgia. He had been in the Immortal Realm for years, yet he felt no belonging here—his heart still yearned for the Nine Domains. The place that gave him true belonging was the Ascension Sect. As for rebuilding his power, Luo Tian had not yet considered it; he would wait until he reached the Immortal King level. Otherwise, his forces would be doomed to annihilation. Still, another thought lingered in his mind—rebuilding the Dao Sect. Yet if he did so, it would inevitably clash with the Eternity Mountain. The outcome was predictable.

"Alas..." Luo Tian mused, feeling the weight of his insignificance.

"Senior Tian!" A call snapped him back to reality. Ye Liangchen stood before him, his gaze filled with sorrow.

"I've come to bid you farewell!" Luo Tian chuckled lightly, watching Ye Chen who had arrived upon hearing the news.

"Bid what farewell? Stay in Star River Prefecture, no one dares to trouble us!" Ye Liangchen spoke, but Ye Chen said nothing. He knew Luo Tian's nature—restless and unable to stay.

"I'm going to Mount Supreme Heaven. Take care of yourselves here!" Luo Tian said, chuckling.

"Yes, Senior Tian, rest assured. We'll visit Mount Supreme Heaven too!" Ye Liangchen replied. He had gradually begun to take over Star River Prefecture's affairs, gaining some power. Ye Chen was the same, and Ye Tian had started entrusting him with his tasks. If not for Luo Tian's refusal, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian would have entrusted him with some responsibilities as well.

"Yes, I won't stay long. We'll meet again someday!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice laced with a smile.

Luo Tian said no more and led the Dark Demon Eight Guardians toward the hall, sensing Si Ma Feiying's hostility toward him.

"Let's go!" Si Ma Feiying had been waiting for Luo Tian, his eyes filled with impatience.

"Senior Tian, be careful. If anyone troubles you, send me a message. My son Ye Wudao is no one to trifle with!" Ye Wudao spoke coldly, his gaze lingering on Si Ma Feiying.

From the moment Luo Tian entered, Si Ma Feiying had given him no pleasant looks. Ye Wudao had initially overlooked it for Jiang Yuzhe's sake, but this was Star River Prefecture, and Luo Tian was his adopted son. How could he tolerate Si Ma Feiying's attitude? Not even Jiang Yuzhe himself would dare to treat Ye Wudao with such disrespect. Seeing Si Ma Feiying's condescending behavior toward Luo Tian, Ye Wudao finally erupted. Alongside Ye Tian, he stared at Si Ma Feiying with a cold gaze that sent the latter into icy despair.

"Respectful elders, we must take our leave!" Si Ma Feiying finally understood and bowed to Ye Wudao and Ye Tian, slinking toward Star River Prefecture's mountain gate.

"That thing, you keep it. It symbolizes Star River Prefecture!" Seeing Si Ma Feiying's retreat, Ye Wudao let out a cold snort and turned to Luo Tian.

"Yes, I'll take my leave now, Uncle Ye, Uncle Ye Tian!" Luo Tian smiled respectfully, bowing to both men.

Luo Tian chuckled and strode toward Star River Prefecture's mountain gate, the Dark Demon Eight Guardians expressionless as they followed.

Moments later, Luo Tian reached Star River Prefecture's mountain gate and saw Si Ma Feiying standing there with a sour face.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian chuckled, watching Si Ma Feiying. After all, Jiang Yuzhe had given the Supreme Heaven Seal to Si Ma Feiying; he must have exceptional abilities.

"First, go to Huan Tian City and use the transmission array to enter the Upper Three Heavens, then proceed to Mount Supreme Heaven!" Si Ma Feiying snorted, still looking down on Luo Tian.

"Uncle Jiang Yuzhe summoned me for what purpose?" As they took flight toward Huan Tian City, Luo Tian inquired. After all, the Upper Three Heavens were where the top immortals gathered.

Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen were also on Mount Supreme Heaven. Gu Qianxue's other manifestation was on the Ghost King Mountain. Jiang Sxi and Leng Qiuchan had yet to be found, and where were Gu Tian, Zhang Daotian, and others? Luo Tian had no idea. He felt a premonition that visiting the Upper Three Heavens might bring him into contact with many familiar faces.

"Because Uncle Jiang Yuzhe wishes to compete for the position of Second Sect Master."

"To compete for the Second Sect Master, one must possess a Supreme Heaven Seal. Do you understand now?" Si Ma Feiying's expression was disdainful, yet he spoke.

"Oh?" Upon hearing Si Ma Feiying's words, Luo Tian immediately understood. The younger generation had already matured significantly. Star River Prefecture's Ye Liangchen had begun to take over its affairs, and other sects were the same.

"I didn't expect it so soon. Do you know the rules?" Luo Tian ignored Si Ma Feiying's sneering gaze and asked again.

"I don't know. The sect master always sets the rules!" Si Ma Feiying replied impatiently.

For three days, Luo Tian questioned Si Ma Feiying about Mount Supreme Heaven's affairs. Though impatient, Si Ma Feiying answered thoroughly, as if fulfilling a duty. After three days of travel, Luo Tian and Si Ma Feiying finally reached their destination—Huan Tian City. Upon entering, Luo Tian's expression turned icy.

"How does it feel? Being deprived of your Supreme Heaven Seal here?" Si Ma Feiying spoke coldly for the first time. His mission was to bring Luo Tian to Huan Tian City and meet Jiang Huantian, then the three would proceed to Mount Supreme Heaven. Hearing Si Ma Feiying's words, Luo Tian's expression darkened slightly, but he consoled himself internally. Throughout the journey, Si Ma Feiying had imparted much knowledge to Luo Tian, preventing him from being clueless upon arriving at Mount Supreme Heaven.
