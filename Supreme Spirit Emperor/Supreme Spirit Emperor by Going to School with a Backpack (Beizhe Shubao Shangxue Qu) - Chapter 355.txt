“Ah! Rest assured, this is but the Thunder Domain. We are no longer the naive youths of yore; I believe there will be no major issues!” Ren Hongzhe nodded, though he was somewhat concerned, he still followed Luo Tian’s words.

A surge of transmission power enveloped Luo Tian and his companions, and moments later, they appeared within the Chaos Domain.

The Chaos Domain, before the calamity of the Nine Holy Beasts of the Mortal Realm, had always been enigmatic and rarely interacted with the outside world. Only a few sacred clans of the Holy Seats had the privilege to enter the Chaos Domain.

With the chaos unleashed by the Nine Holy Beasts of the Mortal Realm, the nine domains became interconnected. The Chaos Domain emerged from obscurity, and people from other domains frequently entered it.

Beneath the gray expanse of stars, the air thrummed with chaotic energy. Luo Tian and his companions altered their appearances again, wandering through the Chaos Domain.

It was their first time visiting the Chaos Domain, so they were somewhat unfamiliar with it. However, Luo Tian had previously investigated the domain while searching for Gu Qianxue and Sun Mengru, thus he possessed some knowledge of the Chaos Domain.

The Chaos Domain also had a sacred site known as the Chaos Continent, located at its core. On this continent stood the Chaos Palace—the greatest sacred site of the entire domain, where Zhu Ge Jie and the Zhu Ge Imperial Court resided.

“Luo Tian, are you certain it was the Chaos Domain?” Diao Dezhu’s face bore a grave expression. The Chaos Palace was no mere clan like the Phoenix Clan; it was an authentic sacred site, home to beings who had once ascended as Epoch Lords. Its depth of power was unfathomable. He feared Luo Tian’s fury would cloud his judgment, and that they would dare to confront a sacred site with their meager strength.

“Uncertain, but I cannot ignore it!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold determination as he strode toward the direction of the Chaos Palace.

“If it truly was the Chaos Domain, I shall make them regret this!” Luo Tian let out a cold snort. He knew the Chaos Domain was formidable, but they were not defenseless; he had full confidence in their ability to depart from the Chaos Domain unscathed.

“Fourth Holy Star Domain, Luo Tian comes to pay his respects!” After a day of flying through the Chaos Domain, they arrived at the outskirts of the Chaos Continent. Rather than rushing in, they stood within the star domain and called out toward the Chaos Continent.

“Luo Tian? What business do you have in our Chaos Domain?” A voice of confusion echoed. Zhu Ge Jie and his brother Zhu Ge Huangchao, accompanied by the people of the Chaos Domain, appeared at the domain’s edge. Their gazes fell upon Luo Tian with caution.

Chapter 1428: The Abyss of Chaos

“Luo Tian, what do you mean?” Zhu Ge Jie’s face darkened as he gazed at Luo Tian standing before him. His arrival in the Chaos Domain clearly showed no respect for it. Luo Tian’s group had arrived too swiftly, so the people of the Chaos Domain had yet to learn about Luo Li and others being taken.

“What do you mean, Zhu Ge Jie? We had an agreement not to harm the descendants of other star domains. Yet why did you still attack my kin? Do you think our Fourth Holy Star Domain is a malleable soft plum to be squeezed at will?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold fire as he addressed Zhu Ge Jie.

“You damned fool! When did we ever capture your kin!” Before Zhu Ge Jie could speak, Zhu Ge Huangchao immediately shouted in rebuttal.

“Smack!” Luo Tian’s body flickered, instantly appearing before Zhu Ge Huangchao. He struck him across the face with a resounding slap, sending him flying backward. His gaze bore an icy intensity.

“I was speaking to your brother; you have no right to interject!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his fury reaching its peak. He showed no courtesy to the Chaos Domain and immediately launched a powerful attack.

Luo Tian’s strike left the people of the Chaos Domain stunned, as they had not expected him to arrive with such audacity.

“Boom…” The sound of a bell rang out, and the ancient Chaos Bell instantly enveloped the heads of the Chaos Domain’s people. Zhu Ge Jie’s face was cold as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, you did not inquire into the matter before coming to the Chaos Domain—was it to oppress us? Do you truly believe we are easy prey?” Zhu Ge Jie’s face was icy, clearly enraged by Luo Tian’s actions.

“Brother, subdue him!” Zhu Ge Huangchao spat blood from his mouth, his gaze filled with icy intensity as he shouted. He had suffered a severe loss at Luo Tian’s hands before, and his hatred for Luo Tian had reached its peak.

Chaotic energy spread, and the ancient Chaos Bell radiated immense pressure upon Luo Tian’s group. It seemed as if it would subdue them immediately should their response be unsatisfactory.

“Subdue me? Good—look at this!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a series of images appeared beneath the stars of Zhu Ge. They depicted Luo Li and others being captured, as well as Yu Letian’s collusion with the Tianluo Sect of the Chaos Domain.

“This…” Zhu Ge Jie’s face changed abruptly. He was aware that the Chaos Domain had a presence in the Thunder Domain, and it was no weak force. After all, the Thunder Domain was now a land without a master, and every sacred site sought to claim a share. Other sacred sites also had some presence in the Thunder Domain.

However, Zhu Ge Jie had never paid much attention to Tianluo Sect; the Chaos Domain’s core was within its own domain.

“Luo Tian, there must be a misunderstanding!” Zhu Ge Jie spoke solemnly, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian with gravity.

“What misunderstanding? A misunderstanding is that my son, my disciple, and my nephew were all taken—linked to your Tianluo Sect! What misunderstanding do you speak of?” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his heart already believing Zhu Ge Jie’s words.

Zhu Ge Jie had no reason to deceive him. If they truly had captured Luo Li and others, there would be a purpose behind it. If they had killed them, the Fourth Holy Star Domain would have already erupted in chaos by now.

Yet now, the Fourth Holy Star Domain had not spread news of their capture, meaning Luo Li’s soul-lanterns were still alight. Everyone believed they were with him.

If Zhu Ge Jie had truly captured them, there would be a purpose behind it. But now, Zhu Ge Jie had not made any demands—thus it was nearly certain that Luo Li and others’ capture was unknown to the high-ranking figures of the Chaos Domain.

“Clearly, someone wants us to clash, but their methods are too clumsy, leaving too many clues. If it were me, I would never allow so many to witness our actions!” Zhu Ge Jie shook his head. Deep down, he did not wish for a conflict with the Fourth Holy Star Domain, especially after it had eradicated the Phoenix Clan and revealed that the Fourth Holy Star Domain possessed an Epoch-peak powerhouse.

“Then who? Tianluo Sect is your Chaos Domain’s faction, and it is the only clue left. Where should I go to find them?” Luo Tian’s face remained cold, resolute in blaming the Chaos Domain.

“You are overstepping! We have already made an effort to explain, giving you a great favor. What more do you want?” Zhu Ge Huangchao and the many powerful figures of the Chaos Domain shouted at Luo Tian.

“Indeed, do you think yourself so important? Even if you were once a hero of the nine domains, it does not justify such arrogance!” The people of the Chaos Domain glared at Luo Tian with anger.

“Luo Tian,” Diao Dezhu and the others stood behind Luo Tian with grim expressions, as if facing an imminent threat.

“Boom…” As the two sides stood in confrontation, a resonant sound echoed through the void, making Luo Tian’s group’s gazes grow serious.

“Boom…” The ancient Chaos Bell rang on its own, casting a radiant aura that enveloped the people of the Chaos Domain.

The hums intensified as an immense presence instantly invaded Luo Tian’s group’s minds, and then a grey arrow pierced through the void, directly flying toward Luo Tian’s direction.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing the arrow had locked onto him—there was no escape.

“What is this?” Both sides gazed at the grey arrow flying toward Luo Tian.

“It’s not very powerful; even an Epoch-early level being could withstand it!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, watching the grey arrow approach him. He extended a hand to grasp it.

“Boom…” But before he could seize the arrow, it exploded with a resounding crash, disintegrating into swirling grey mist around him.

“Who!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light, gazing into the void to discern who had attacked.

The hums intensified again; in an instant, grey energy coalesced before Luo Tian, and a series of images appeared within his vision.

In the images, Luo Li and other young prodigies looked anxious as they walked along a grey mountain path, surrounded by grey flames.

“Luo Li!” Seeing the images, Luo Tian’s face was filled with frenzy. His heart roared with fury as he gazed at the children’s tense expressions, and he let out a low growl toward the void: “Speak up—what are your conditions? I will do whatever it takes!”

“Boom…” The images shattered, and a grey figure materialized before Luo Tian. Its gaze held amusement as it smirked at Luo Tian.

“Ming Huan!” Seeing the figure’s form, Luo Tian and his companions’ faces changed abruptly. Their bodies radiated violent killing intent, even Zhu Ge Jie’s expression shifted.

“Haha, Luo Tian—didn’t expect you to have some wits; you didn’t start a war with the Chaos Domain immediately!” The grey energy took on Ming Huan’s form, speaking to Luo Tian.

“What do you mean?” Luo Tian’s gaze was icy as he addressed Ming Huan, clearly now in Ming Huan’s hands.

“I need something! I am unable to retrieve it myself, so I ask you to fetch it for me!” Ming Huan smiled as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“What is it?” Luo Tian asked solemnly, his voice laced with curiosity as he gazed at Ming Huan.

“Primordial Magnetic Divine Light!” Ming Huan responded, his gaze meeting Luo Tian’s—but before he finished speaking, Zhu Ge Huangchao and the many powerful figures of the Chaos Domain’s faces changed abruptly. Their gazes turned hostile toward Ming Huan.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, gazing at Ming Huan. He had heard of the Primordial Magnetic Divine Light before—it was an extremely rare phenomenon within the Chaos Abyss, appearing only at certain times and possessing immense power.

However, the nine great abysses of the Chaos Domain differed from other domains’ abysses. While other domains’ abysses were within their respective star domains, the Chaos Domain’s Chaos Abyss was always under the control of the Chaos Palace. Thus, to enter the Chaos Abyss, one must obtain the Chaos Palace’s approval.

“Don’t rush— I can wait. Give me half a year. If you don’t find it, you know the consequences!”

“As for where to send it after you find it, I will contact you later,” Ming Huan smiled again.

“Damn!” Luo Tian’s face darkened as he listened to Ming Huan’s words, his expression nearly dripping with anger. He turned his gaze toward Zhu Ge Jie.

“Master Zhu Ge, although this matter is unrelated to the Chaos Domain, Tianluo Sect is indeed a faction of yours. Please allow me to enter the Chaos Abyss!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Zhu Ge Jie, speaking softly.

Luo Tian had no choice but to do so; the situation had changed, and although he was reluctant, he chose to lower his head and negotiate with the Chaos Domain.

“Haha! Luo Tian, you think too highly of yourself!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhu Ge Huangchao laughed loudly, his gaze filled with disdain as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Earlier you were so bold—slapped me and sent me flying—but now you’re begging us. You speak politely, do you think the Chaos Domain is your family’s business?” Zhu Ge Huangchao was shamelessly mocking Luo Tian.

Hearing Zhu Ge Huangchao’s unhidden mockery, Luo Tian felt a surge of killing intent. Yet he still gazed at Zhu Ge Jie.

“Master Zhu Ge, I was indeed in the wrong before! Please….” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Zhu Ge Jie, hoping he would agree.

Half a year seemed long, but who knew when the Primordial Magnetic Divine Light would appear or where it would emerge? To avoid conflict and waste time entering the Chaos Abyss, Luo Tian had no choice but to lower his head.

“Impossible!” But before Luo Tian’s words even finished, Zhu Ge Jie coldly shook his head. Luo Tian had repeatedly insulted the Chaos Domain; how could he possibly help him now?

“Truly no room for negotiation?” Hearing Zhu Ge Huangchao’s words, Luo Tian’s face gradually darkened. He had already gone this far, yet they remained so resolute—his patience was dwindling.

“Master Zhu Ge, if you don’t agree, you may face consequences you cannot bear!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes gleamed with amusement as he gazed at Zhu Ge Jie, pulling out a token—a token representing the Beast Domain.

Chapter 1429: A Dilemma of Advance and Retreat

The others gazed at Diao Dezhu’s token, recognizing it as the Beast Emperor’s Token. The Beast Domain possessed only ten of these tokens; whoever held one was effectively the highest ruler of the Beast Domain.

“What do you mean? You couldn’t even negotiate with good intentions before resorting to threats?” Zhu Ge Jie’s face bore a faint smirk as he gazed at Luo Tian and his companions.

Yet Zhu Ge Jie’s mind was quite serious. The Fourth Holy Star Domain had reached its zenith, having eradicated the Phoenix Clan. Luo Tian’s prestige across the nine domains was unparalleled. Moreover, due to Luo Tian, the Beast Domain, Fire Domain, and the demons of the Divine-Monster Domain were closely allied with the Fourth Holy Star Domain. Without these major forces, the Fourth Holy Star Domain would not have developed so rapidly.

If Luo Tian truly went mad and united all his allies to attack the Chaos Domain, then the Chaos Domain would be in grave danger. It was likely that they would be annihilated by these forces.

“Indeed! You dare to threaten!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes gleamed with amusement as he gazed at Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“You dare!” Zhu Ge Jie showed no signs of retreating, his voice like a thunderclap echoing through the chaotic stars. It caused the ancient Chaos Bell to emit a series of resonant hums.

“You have time for only half a year!” Ming Huan’s face bore a faint smile as he strolled away.

“Boom…” But before Ming Huan could turn, Luo Tian’s body emitted a series of resounding rumbles. He launched a punch directly at the grey figure.

Ming Huan’s form was instantly reduced to swirling grey mist, vanishing from the sight of all.

Luo Tian’s face was dark as he unleashed his formidable refining power upon the grey mist, then a soul-force emerged from it.

“Luo Tian’s body emitted an invisible wave that entered the soul-force, and his face then bore a cold glint.

“Go!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his body flickering and transforming into a long rainbow streak. He did not even glance at the others, vanishing from the sight of the Chaos Domain’s people.

“Master Zhu Ge, give me three days to decide—should you refuse, then war!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in the ears of all, causing the Chaos Domain people to change faces.

“What happened?” Diao Dezhu and others looked puzzled, unsure why Luo Tian had suddenly left. They could only follow behind Luo Tian, flying toward the distance.

“Hmph!” Zhu Ge Huangchao let out a cold snort, his gaze filled with disdain. In his view, Luo Tian would never dare to attack the Chaos Domain outright. After all, the Chaos Domain’s depth of power was formidable; if they truly clashed, both sides would suffer heavy losses.

“Prepare first—he’s a madman!” Zhu Ge Jie’s gaze was deep, for if Luo Tian truly led several forces to attack, he would have to consider whether to fight. If they fought, the Chaos Domain would surely lose; if they did not fight, it would be a significant blow to the Chaos Domain.

Luo Tian’s feet moved with wind, slicing through the stars. Using his unique sensitivity to soul-force, he clutched a fragment of Ming Huan’s soul. Though weak, Luo Tian was confident that with this faint soul-force, he could locate Ming Huan’s true body. If he found Ming Huan’s true body, it would be much easier.

“Regret! Bitterness!” Luo Tian felt a whirlwind of emotions, never expecting that merely wanting his juniors to train would result in such consequences. His wives had just found some clues, and now his juniors were caught again.

Luo Tian’s aura was overwhelming, as if he were charging headlong through the void. He soon appeared at the entrance of the Chaos Domain’s transmission array.

“Move aside!” Luo Tian waved his sleeve, sending those on the transmission array flying. He stood upon it and shouted at the Chaos Palace’s disciples who operated the transmission:

“Transmit to the Mortal Domain!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out, and the disciple instantly regained his composure. Upon seeing Luo Tian on the transmission array, his eyes turned respectful.

The people who had been sent flying by Luo Tian changed their expressions to respect upon recognizing him, showing no signs of resentment.

“Hum…” A surge of transmission power rose from Luo Tian’s body, and in the next moment, his figure vanished from sight.

“Return to the Fourth Holy Star Domain and wait for me!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed through the stars of the Chaos Domain. At the same time, Diao Dezhu and others appeared at the transmission array’s exterior.

“Good!” Diao Dezhu and others exchanged glances, standing upon the transmission array and vanishing from their original spot.

The Mortal Domain—Luo Tian appeared instantly, following the faint presence of Ming Huan’s soul.

“Do you know where I am?” On a grey continent, Ming Huan sat cross-legged. Ming Zhenyan stood beside him, his gaze cold as he watched Luo Tian appear in the Mortal Domain.

“Should we kill him?” Ming Zhenyan’s eyes flashed with cold light as he addressed Ming Huan. If Luo Tian were alone, it would be the perfect opportunity to kill him.

“No, we cannot enter the Chaos Abyss; we need him to fetch the Primordial Magnetic Divine Light for us!” Ming Huan spoke softly, his hands moving as invisible seals were imprinted onto his body.

“Boom…” After the seal was imprinted on Ming Huan’s soul, the faint soul-force in Luo Tian’s hand exploded with a resounding crash. This caused Luo Tian to stop his movement.

“Damn!” Luo Tian looked at his empty palm, cursing under his breath. His gaze turned toward the endless starfield.

Luo Tian knew that without this soul-force, finding Ming Huan in the Mortal Domain would be impossible. With his methods, there were countless ways to make Luo Tian lose track of him—just as if he wanted to hide, no one could find him without special means.

“Seems I have no choice but to enter the Chaos Abyss!” Luo Tian flickered his body and suddenly turned, flying toward the Fourth Holy Star Domain.

As Luo Tian shouted outside the Chaos Domain, news of his juniors being captured spread throughout the nine domains. The entire domain was in uproar.

The Fourth Holy Star Domain was now incredibly powerful, with an Epoch-peak powerhouse stationed within it. Yet someone dared to attack the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s head, capturing its young generation—this was truly shocking.

The relationship between the Fourth Holy Star Domain and the Chaos Domain also became tense, causing the nine domains to tremble again. First, the Beast Domain’s domain master Long Jie left the Beast Domain and arrived at the Fourth Holy Star Domain. Then, he issued a message that half of the Beast Domain’s strength had left to search for the remnants of the Mortal Clan.

The Demon Domain and Fire Domain also dispatched their strength to assist the Fourth Holy Star Domain in searching. The nine domains once again became chaotic due to the young generation’s disappearance.

“Whoever provides information on Ming Huan will be rewarded with a pseudo-Epoch Relic. If they can return one of the young generation, they will be given a drop of immortal medicine’s elixir!” The Fourth Holy Star Domain issued an exorbitant bounty, causing the nine domains to tremble.

Even providing information earned a pseudo-Epoch Relic, and such a gesture made the nine domains go mad.

The elixir of immortal medicine was only one drop, but it was priceless. Such a price would even make the sacred sites envious. In an instant, everyone began searching for Ming Huan and Ming Zhenyan.

Luo Tian walked through the stars of the Fourth Holy Star Domain, his eyes filled with guilt. His gaze was deep and resolute—he felt too ashamed to face Gu Lei and Zheng Xin. They had entrusted their children to him, but now they were taken by others under his care, and even suffered due to his involvement.

Luo Tian’s thoughts were deep as he arrived at the Tianyuan Continent, where people waited anxiously on the Five Elements Mountain. Long Jie, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Lu Tianyu also arrived hurriedly.

“Luo Tian!” Upon seeing Luo Tian’s arrival, the people immediately surrounded him, their gazes filled with inquiry.

“No luck,” Luo Tian shook his head gently, gazing at Gu Lei and Zheng Xin with a hint of regret.

“Apologies—I failed to protect them,” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with intense self-reproach.

“Ah, it’s not your fault. Now we must find a way to rescue the children!” Gu Lei shook his head gently, showing no blame toward Luo Tian. After all, Luo Li, Dong Yichen, and Zi Mo had also been taken by others.

“Luo Tian, destroy the Chaos Domain! With our strength, what is the Chaos Domain? Then enter the abyss and retrieve the Primordial Magnetic Divine Light. First, exchange the children from Ming Huan!” Xu Liyi shouted with a ruthless tone. The children were all raised by him, and he had deep feelings for them.

“Yes! The Chaos Domain gave us a face we didn’t want—just destroy it!” Some people with hot tempers shouted, vowing to annihilate the Chaos Domain.

Hearing their words, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. Though he did not wish to clash with the Mortal Domain now, if Zhu Ge Jie continued to act recklessly, he would not hesitate to fight.

“Gather people—let’s go!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, not wanting to waste time. He shouted at the people who had been shouting. His voice was cold.

“Got it!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing and Lu Tianyu rose immediately. They vanished into the hall, their gazes filled with ferocity.

“Prepare!” Luo Tian’s body rose into the sky, his voice echoing across the Tianyuan Continent.

“Luo Tian! All of the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s forces, follow me into battle against the Chaos Domain!” Upon Luo Tian’s voice echoing, the entire Tianyuan Continent trembled. His words were like a decree for the Fourth Holy Star Domain, with no reason behind them.

“Boom….” A massive void warship roared out, its sound echoing as it hovered above the people. Luo Tian soared into the air—this time truly pressing him to desperation. If Zhu Ge Jie did not agree, Luo Tian would definitely fight until the end.

Before the lives of his juniors, what was the nine domains or the royal clan’s invasion? Luo Tian had cultivated all his life to protect his loved ones. Now, their safety was threatened—this had touched Luo Tian’s very core.

Chapter 1430: Pressure

As Luo Tian’s words echoed, the people of the Fourth Holy Star Domain all responded in unison. A series of figures gathered from various sects toward the Tianyuan Continent.

The Fourth Holy Star Domain had once been the weakest of the nine domains. People knew that without Luo Tian, they would never have reached their current state. This was the first time Luo Tian had asked for all of the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s forces to fight, and people would not dare to refuse.

“Boom….” On the void warship, all super-advanced level cultivators of the Tianyuan Continent stood upon it. A total of several million people—this was the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s entire strength.

At the front of the warship, Luo Tian and others stood there, their auras piercing the sky. Their gazes were fierce as they looked toward the Chaos Domain.

“Attack!” The massive warship slowly opened, slicing through the void as it flew toward the Chaos Domain.

On another side, people of the Fire Domain also gathered in waves, flying toward the Chaos Domain.

“Roar…” A dragon’s roar echoed as a series of mighty beasts, their power overwhelming, roared out from the Beast Domain. Their massive bodies carried immense pressure as they gathered outside the Sacred City.

“Go!” Long Jie, with his hands behind his back, led the Beast Domain’s many powerful figures toward the Chaos Domain.

Demon energy surged as Nan Gong Yuqing, with a blood-red long sword on his back, led the demons behind him. Their faces bore an icy intensity, as if they were demons emerging from hell.

“What’s going on? Void warships and ancient palaces! My heavens, the Fourth Holy Star Domain is truly about to attack a sacred site!”

“Luo Tian, Jiang Nanxuan, Zheng Xin! Gu Lei… all of the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s young generation have appeared!”

“Also, the elders—Luo Xiong, Luo Nantian, Sha Cangmang have also appeared. They haven’t been seen for a long time!” People were stunned as they gazed at the people on the void warship.

“Several million super-advanced level cultivators, tens of thousands of saint-level cultivators! My heavens, this is the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s terrifying strength!”

“Is that the Epoch-peak powerhouse of the Fourth Holy Star Domain?” People murmured, their gazes filled with awe. This was even more massive than the previous incident when the Fourth Holy Star Domain had eradicated the Phoenix Clan.

“Hearing it, they were captured by the Chaos Domain!” Soon people learned of the reason.

“Will a war between two domains begin? The Fourth Holy Star Domain is so powerful—can the Chaos Domain be a match for it? Why not just open the Chaos Abyss?” The nine domains all discussed.

The same scene occurred in the Beast Domain, Divine-Monster Domain, and Fire Domain—people marveled at Luo Tian’s power, showing even more reverence for him and the Fourth Holy Star Domain.

Not only did several sacred sites witness this, but other sects that revered Luo Tian and remembered his kindness also gathered toward the Chaos Domain after receiving news.

“Damn!” In the Chaos Domain, Zhu Ge Jie received the news and his face darkened. He had not expected Luo Tian to move so quickly.

“Why fear? If it comes down to a fight, we’ll die together. Don’t think the Chaos Domain is like those Phoenix Clans!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face was dark as he spoke.

“Yes, if it comes to a fight, we’ll die! When has the Chaos Domain ever feared?” Some of the warlike figures of the Chaos Domain spoke loudly, their voices filled with strong fighting spirit.

“Master Zhu Ge, let them enter! The Chaos Abyss is an abyss; even if they do, it won’t be a good outcome!” Some of the peace-seeking figures spoke to persuade Zhu Ge Jie, not wanting the Chaos Domain to fight.

“Rubbish! Once is once—don’t back down, fight until the end!” Zhu Ge Huangchao shouted fiercely, glaring at those who sought peace.

The entire Chaos Domain’s hall immediately became chaotic, causing Zhu Ge Huangchao to feel some headaches. This was the first time he had felt such a headache since succeeding as domain master.

“Boom…” A heavy bell sound rang out, and the ancient Chaos Bell emitted a thunderous roar across the domain. The people in the hall changed faces.

“The Chaos Bell is warning us—Luo Tian’s forces have arrived!” An elder spoke, and the people in the hall gazed through the void toward the star domain’s exterior. They saw the massive void warship approaching with a thunderous sound.

“Zhu Ge Jie, what is your decision?” The massive void warship sliced through the void. On it, the ancient palaces radiated a series of glows, carrying overwhelming power as they appeared outside the Chaos Continent. Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in their ears, causing the people of the Chaos Domain gathered on the Chaos Continent to tremble.

“Go!” Zhu Ge Jie’s face was dark, and he and the people in the hall appeared at the Chaos Continent’s exterior. His gaze fell upon the massive warship, his eyes narrowing slightly.

Seeing it with his own eyes, the overwhelming pressure made Zhu Ge Jie move in awe. He had not expected the Fourth Holy Star Domain to have developed so far.

“Zhu Ge Jie, open the Chaos Abyss! Will you or not!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed through the stars. His gaze fell upon the many people of the Chaos Domain gathered together.

Three days had passed, and under Zhu Ge Jie’s call, the Chaos Domain was prepared. A series of powerful figures stood behind Zhu Ge Jie, their auras matching the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s.

However, the Fourth Holy Star Domain’s elite strength was far superior to that of the Chaos Domain. Just one Epoch-peak powerhouse, Xuan Bing Laozu, was enough to make the Chaos Domain’s people tremble.

“Luo Tian, don’t push me too far!” Zhu Ge Jie shouted, his voice equally strong. Luo Tian’s overwhelming arrival clearly showed no respect for the Chaos Domain.

“Haha! Zhu Ge Jie, today I am pushing you—what can you do?” A powerful voice echoed. The massive figure stepped through the stars, his fierce energy spreading across the domain. Long Jie led the Beast Domain’s many beasts, appearing at the western side of the Chaos Continent. This formed a pincer attack with the Fourth Holy Star Domain, sandwiching the Chaos Palace in between.

“Beast Domain!” The people of the Chaos Domain trembled, gazing at the massive figures that filled almost the entire sky. Their eyes were filled with fear.

The Beast Domain had once ranked second among the nine domains, and its strength was naturally formidable. Even a single Phoenix Clan had been a sacred site. Though the Phoenix Clan’s betrayal had damaged the Beast Domain, no one dared to underestimate its presence—neither did the Divine Clan dare to confront it directly.

The Beast Emperor’s Mirror radiated an ultimate power, illuminating the entire sky and echoing with the ancient palaces. It brought immense pressure to the Chaos Domain.

“Haha! I didn’t arrive too late, did I?” Demon energy surged as a black cloud of darkness appeared. The demons of the Demon Domain arrived at the northern side of the Chaos Continent, with a black demon sword hovering above their heads. It resembled a black crescent moon, radiating overwhelming energy—the Demon Domain’s Epoch-Relic, Wuji Demon Sword.

Intense heat spread through the stars, as if a sea of fire had burned through them. The Fire Domain’s people arrived in turn, though they did not possess an Epoch-Relic, their strength was still formidable. They appeared at the southern side of the Chaos Palace.

Luo Tian and Sun Kemin waved their hands, and the Yin-Yang Fish surged skyward. They enveloped the Fire Domain’s people with a powerful aura, and black and white energy descended upon them.

Four treasures radiated strong power, their supreme might pressing down on the entire sky. Even the ancient Chaos Bell was subjected to immense pressure, emitting a thunderous sound as it resisted their power.

“Damn!” Zhu Ge Jie and the other powerful figures of the Chaos Domain’s faces turned dark. Luo Tian had assembled such a formidable force, and this strength could easily crush the Chaos Domain. Even if they unleashed all their secrets, it would be impossible to withstand.

“Whether to fight or make peace is entirely up to you!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed through the stars, causing the people of the Chaos Domain to tremble involuntarily.

“Roar…” The roar of four forces echoed through the sky, their fierce fighting spirit slicing through the stars. It completely suppressed the people of the Chaos Domain.

“What should we do?” Zhu Ge Jie felt a deep sense of difficulty in his heart. He had not expected Luo Tian to dare start a war between the star domains. But now, seeing Luo Tian’s cold eyes, Zhu Ge Jie felt some regret. He should have given Luo Tian a favor when he had asked before, and thus would not be in this difficult situation now.

“Luo Tian, don’t be so arrogant! If we fight, your four forces will also suffer countless losses. In that case, when the ancient royal clan emerges, without us, humanity will be unable to resist their attack! You would become the villain of the nine domains!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face was fierce as he shouted.

“Haha! Zhu Ge Huangchao, you don’t know what I did for the nine domains. Now my descendants are in danger—what do you mean by talking about the nine domains? Go to hell, villain! When I sacrificed myself and sealed the Chaos Domain’s entrance, what were you doing?”

“Do you think my descendants should die? Do I have to sacrifice myself for the nine domains? I can sacrifice myself, but I will not allow my descendants to suffer any harm!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, his voice filled with madness.

“You!” Seeing Luo Tian’s madness, the people of the Chaos Domain trembled.

“Three breaths to decide—open the Chaos Abyss and let us enter. If you don’t agree, we’ll flatten the Chaos Domain!” Luo Tian did not wait for the people of the Chaos Domain to speak, and he spoke again.

“Flatten the Chaos Domain!” The four forces roared in unison, their voices shaking the stars. Their energy surged into the sky as if they would crush forward at Luo Tian’s command.

“One breath!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, not giving Zhu Ge Jie a chance to argue. His cold voice echoed from his mouth.

“Just what should we do!” A series of voices from the Chaos Domain’s powerful figures echoed in Zhu Ge Jie’s mind, causing him to feel a headache.

“Two breaths!” Luo Tian did not care and continued speaking, as the four forces had already drawn their weapons. Their gazes were fierce toward the people of the Chaos Domain.

Chapter 1431: Do You Agree?

“I….” Hearing Luo Tian’s cold voice, Zhu Ge Jie’s face turned pale. He gazed at the four forces surrounding the Chaos Palace tightly, as if waiting for Luo Tian’s command to flatten the entire Chaos Continent.

Zhu Ge Jie wanted to protest, but his words could not leave his mouth.

“Three breaths!” Luo Tian’s face bore a cold expression, and his voice seemed to come from the depths of hell. After speaking, he gazed at Zhu Ge Jie.

“Time’s up! Everyone, follow me—flatten the Chaos Continent!” Luo Tian spoke loudly and then his aura surged into a brilliant white light, rushing toward Zhu Ge Jie.
