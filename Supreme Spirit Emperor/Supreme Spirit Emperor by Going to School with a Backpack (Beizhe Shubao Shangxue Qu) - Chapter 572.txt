Wang Tong had no idea of the true reason. His purpose in coming to the Wheel Rotation Temple was merely to observe. He also suspected that the Holy Son had killed Wang Heng. The Wheel Rotation Temple's arrest of Yang Huanyu might not even exist—it was merely an excuse to exonerate the Holy Son.

"Du Zijue, stop talking. No one considers you mute!" Wang Tong's face was ashen, his cold gaze fixed on the Heavenly Ghost King.

"Welcome, the Eight Heavenly Kings to my Wheel Rotation Temple!" As the group murmured among themselves, a cheerful laugh echoed in their ears. The Eight Supreme Elders had arrived and stood before the Eight Heavenly Kings.

"Du Lao, it's been a while. Your风采 remains unchanged!" Seeing the arrival of the Eight Supreme Elders, Tian Gui Wang and Yuan Gui Wang immediately ceased their quarrel.

"Enough. Please enter the Wheel Rotation Temple for a discussion," After Du Jianxing and his companions exchanged greetings with the Eight Heavenly Kings, they led them into the Wheel Rotation Temple.

Time flowed slowly. The Wheel Rotation Temple grew increasingly lively until it was finally the day of the Ten Palace Grand Tournament.

The temple's gates slowly opened, and countless disciples emerged from the Wheel Rotation Temple, occupying ten million miles around it.

"Boom... Boom..." Thunderous roars echoed as the heavens split open, revealing three massive battle platforms.

Heaven and earth trembled as the three platforms radiated immense combat intent, leaving the Wheel Rotation Temple's disciples awestruck.

"I've never seen the Ten Palace Grand Tournament before!"

"Since I joined the Wheel Rotation Temple, the tournament has always been held in other palaces. This time it's on our doorstep; if we come last, the Wheel Rotation Temple would be a disgrace."

Numerous seats appeared above the high platform. Eight figures stepped out from the sky, radiating formidable power—these were the Eight Heavenly Kings.

The Eight Heavenly Kings held high status and immense strength; this time, they served as judges.

They split into two groups, standing on two high platforms respectively, their gazes sweeping over the crowd.

Nine figures emerged from the sky again, radiating immense pressure. The leader was Black and White Wuchang. Upon their arrival, the chaotic disciples erupted in cheers.

"It seems the other palaces intentionally delayed," Black and White Wuchang's eyes gleamed with a hint of amusement, but their gaze remained cold.

According to tradition, the Ten Palace Grand Tournament required participants to arrive early, but this time they deliberately delayed—clearly showing contempt for the Wheel Rotation Temple.

"Haha, did we arrive late?" As Black and White Wuchang's words finished, a cheerful laugh echoed through the heavens.

Pressure surged as the heavens roared. Nine figures flew from afar, appearing above the Wheel Rotation Temple without moving their feet.

A middle-aged man with black aura led the group, his face glowing with dark light, his body massive. Notably, he had a black horn on his head.

"Old Ghost of the Heaven's Domain, you're early!" Black and White Wuchang smiled at the horned man.

"Yin Shen Palace, Tianyu Ghost, Immortal King Peak!" The Wheel Rotation Temple's disciples gasped in astonishment upon seeing the newcomer.

"Good, you're not late!" As people marveled, additional powerful fluctuations emerged from all directions of the Wheel Rotation Temple.

"Fengdu Palace, Ye Fengdu... Five Palaces..." The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Temple shouted out palace names and their masters' titles, voices filled with excitement.

Ten figures at the peak of Immortal King stood there; though their power wasn't released, it made all realms tremble, as if they were the very heavens above.

"Immortal King Peak—heard that Immortal King Peak can make Heaven avoid, so it's true!" People's eyes sparkled with excitement. Witnessing the Ten Palace Masters was a once-in-a-thousand-years event.

"Ten Immortal King Peaks, and over thirty at the middle stage... more than forty at the initial stage!" Ye Chen's heart trembled as he gazed at the masters above.

As a genius of Star River Mansion, Ye Chen had seen Immortal Kings before, but this was his first time seeing so many.

He had also entered the Mountain of Repairing Heaven, knowing its strength. Yet Ye Chen was certain that the Mountain of Repairing Heaven's power slightly surpassed the Wheel Rotation Temple. However, the Mountain of Repairing Heaven ranked third among the Nine Immortal Mountains, while the Wheel Rotation Temple was at the bottom.

"Terrifying—should these masters truly break free from Hell, what would the Immortal Realm use to resist?" Ye Chen's heart trembled; for the first time, he realized Hell's terrifying nature.

Originally, Ye Chen believed that the Nine Immortal Mountains' strength must surpass the阎罗 Ten Palaces. This was a common belief among the Immortal Realm. Yet after entering Hell, this view was completely overturned.

"Black and White, you've ascended to the peak! Congratulations!" A middle-aged man spoke, his voice carrying a hint of joy.

"Little wonder you're so confident—now you have solid backing!" Other Immortal King Peaks also spoke.

"Enough, since everyone has arrived, let's begin! Rules need not be explained; it's not the first time we've fought!" Black and White Wuchang didn't take it seriously, instead leaping onto a platform.

Du Jianxing and three other Immortal King Middle Stage Supreme Elders also leaped onto the platform, their eyes filled with confidence. Among the阎罗 Ten Palaces, the Wheel Rotation Temple had the most Immortal King Middle Stage masters—four in total.

The Ten Palace Grand Tournament followed an points-based system: Palace Master vs. Palace Master, first place gets 100 points; subsequent positions follow accordingly.

Vice Palace Masters and Holy Sons fought in teams of four, with first place receiving 100 points. Thus, to secure a high rank, both Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters, even Holy Sons, needed strength.

"Come on!" Black and White Wuchang shouted at the Palace Masters, their voices filled with battle intent.

"You've really grown confident!" The Palace Masters smiled, descending to the platforms. A humming sound rose beneath their feet as the platforms vanished from sight.

"Please draw lots to determine your positions," Zun Gui Wang addressed Du Jianxing and others, flanked by three Heavenly Kings. The four served as judges for the Vice Palace Master matches.

As for the Palace Masters' battles, even though they were Immortal King Middle Stage masters, they couldn't judge the outcomes. The Palace Masters themselves would determine their victories.

"You little ones come up too!" Shou Gui Wang and the four Heavenly Kings smiled, addressing the crowd.

A fluctuation echoed as four figures descended from the sky—four men in black robes, radiating True Immortal Late Stage power. They approached Shou Gui Wang.

"Rakshasa Palace, Xiao Feiyu!" Upon seeing the leading figure among them, people gasped.

On another platform, Du Jianxing's group had already begun fighting; the crowd could only hear thunderous roars but couldn't see how Du Jianxing fought.

"Rumors say Xiao Hong of the Rakshasa Palace has no rivals, being the youngest Holy Son. Yet his strength left all of Rakshasa Palace speechless!" The Wheel Rotation Temple's disciples murmured.

"Haha, I heard the Wheel Rotation Palace's Holy Son also has a凶剑 (fearsome sword). Today I want to see it!" A young man laughed, stepping before Shou Gui Wang.

"Fengdu Palace, Ye Qiu!"

"Seven Fearsome Swords—Master of Jueyun Sword has gained Jueyun's approval!" Upon seeing the young man, people's faces changed again. Xiao Hong, who had just landed on the雷台 (Thunder Platform), narrowed his eyes slightly.

Numerous figures ascended the platform, each descent causing gasps. Finally, only the Wheel Rotation Temple remained.

"Where is our Holy Son?" The next moment, the Wheel Rotation disciples turned their gaze to the Eight Heavenly Kings' positions but only saw Wang Gang and others with slightly grim faces. Lo Tian and Fu Xingxuan's absence was nowhere to be found.

Chapter 2176: Huangquan Step (Yellow River Step)

In the depths of Hell, beneath the Yellow River's waters, in a murky yellow space, ten figures flew endlessly, as if searching for something.

"You dare to chase me!" Zhang Kuang's voice echoed through the space, filled with excitement.

A month had passed; Lo Tian had died countless times but finally created a footwork called Huangquan Step.

The entire space couldn't find Lo Tian's presence because his speed was too fast. Not only was he quick, but he also utilized his spiritual awareness for concealment and footwork—now top-tier.

Lo Tian was confident; if he met someone skilled in footwork and concealment again, he wouldn't be so passive.

He had once or twice glimpsed the ten figures' tracks but narrowly evaded each time.

"Finally succeeded!" Lo Tian stood outside a yellow barrier, watching the ten figures flitting like flies. He sighed inwardly.

This month's hardship was known only to Lo Tian; after dying countless times, he had finally created a footwork.

"Perfect!"

"Myself is now perfect!"

"Body unmatched, cultivation at the peak. The only weakness—speed—is completely gone." Lo Tian's eyes gleamed with confidence; even an Immortal King Peak opponent wouldn't fare well against him.

Time flowed slowly. Lo Tian observed the ten figures darting about, waiting for time to pass.

"Ten... nine... eight..." Lo Tian whispered lowly, counting the time since entering. Soon, a day would pass.

"One..."

"Buzz..." As Lo Tian's words finished, the ten figures that had tormented him began to fade, causing a smile on his face.

The yellow barrier before him also slowly dissipated, revealing a red stone and a团 of yellow mist.

"Master!" The red stone shouted excitedly, its voice filled with joy.

"Supreme Stone, you bastard!" Lo Tian gritted his teeth, reaching out to grab the Supreme Stone.

"Congratulations, Master! You've become the owner of this cursed mirror!" The Supreme Stone's voice echoed in Lo Tian's ear.

"Dahuang, come quickly and pay respects to the Master!" The Supreme Stone, seeing Lo Tian's dark gaze, hurriedly addressed the yellow figure.

The yellow figure transformed into a middle-aged man's form, approaching Lo Tian and bowing respectfully. Then he opened his mouth, spitting out a yellow aura that flew toward Lo Tian.

"What is this?" Lo Tian's eyes widened with confusion, grabbing the yellow mark in his hand.

"This is your life essence! Master, swallow it, and you'll become the owner of this cursed mirror!" The Supreme Stone spoke, almost boasting.

"Really?" Lo Tian's eyes showed doubt; he had been tricked too many times by the Supreme Stone.

"If it's fake, Master, throw me into a latrine!"

"Master doesn't know, after I entered, I fought with this thing for three days before subduing it!"

"I subdued it; you subdued me. Naturally, you're its master! We've been waiting for you for a long time!" The Supreme Stone spoke with委屈 (resentment).

"Okay, I'll trust you one last time. If it tricks me again, this isn't over!" Lo Tian gritted his teeth, hearing the Supreme Stone's resentful tone. He swallowed the aura.

"Buzz..." As Lo Tian swallowed the aura, a buzzing sound echoed from his body. His eyes became unimaginable, gazing at the Supreme Stone and the yellow old man's figure.

He could feel the old man's life in his mind, and he had completely mastered the cursed mirror!

"How is it, Master? I didn't deceive you!" The Supreme Stone shouted proudly, watching Lo Tian's astonished expression.

"No..." Lo Tian's eyes sparkled; he hadn't expected the Supreme Stone's words to be true.

In an instant, Lo Tian appeared outside the cursed mirror, gazing at its cracks. He knew it would take some time to restore.

"You've finally awakened!" A voice filled with urgency echoed in Lo Tian's ear.

"Xingxuan!" Hearing the voice, Lo Tian's body trembled slightly. He turned around abruptly, seeing Fu Xingxuan with a worried expression.

Due to the Ten Palace Grand Tournament, Fu Xingxuan had exited her cultivation retreat a few days early. Upon exiting, she saw Lo Tian standing on the cursed mirror like an idiot, his face occasionally showing pain and a foolish grin.

Fu Xingxuan didn't dare to disturb Lo Tian, so she stood still waiting.

"What's wrong?" Fu Xingxuan asked with confusion.

"Nothing, hahaha! Xingxuan, why did you exit your retreat? Did you miss me?" Lo Tian smiled as he approached Fu Xingxuan, rubbing his hands.

"Ah, since you've awakened, let's go quickly; the Ten Palace Grand Tournament might have already started!" Fu Xingxuan suddenly remembered something and leaped onto the tortoise.

Lo Tian's eyes also shifted slightly, leaping onto the tortoise's back. The massive creature carried Lo Tian and Fu Xingxuan outward through the Yellow River.

Meanwhile, everyone outside the Wheel Rotation Temple turned their gaze to Wang Gang and others but saw no sign of Lo Tian or Fu Xingxuan.

"Damn it, what's Lo Chen doing? Did the Palace Master really suppress him?" Wang Gang and others' faces were grim. They knew Lo Chen's strength; without him, they felt uneasy.

"Also, the Holy Daughter hasn't come either. What's going on with them?" The Wheel Rotation disciples noticed Fu Xingxuan's absence, instantly anxious.

Wang Gang and others knew that the other palaces' geniuses were arrogant, with good reason. They weren't all joining the Wheel Rotation Temple; they also wanted to join other阎罗 Palaces. However, those palaces didn't accept them, being exclusive.

Moreover, each palace had its own Holy Son; they couldn't compete, so they chose the Wheel Rotation Temple.

"Let's just fight with us; I want to see what they're capable of!" Mota's eye gleamed with battle intent, gazing at the nine groups already on the platform.

"Wheel Rotation Temple, why haven't you come up yet?" Shou Gui Wang smiled, gazing at the Wheel Rotation Temple's direction. He had noticed Lo Tian's absence and was somewhat surprised.

"Please wait a moment; our Wheel Rotation Temple's Holy Son and Holy Daughter are on their way!" A True Immortal Initial Stage elder spoke. At this time, Du Jianxing and Black and White Wuchang had already begun fighting; naturally, these people were in charge.

"What?" Hearing the deputy palace master's words, the young geniuses on the platform were unwilling.

"Wait for them? Why?" A youth with a sinister face sneered, then gazed at Wang Gang and others.

"You're the so-called Eight Heavenly Kings' sons, right? Choose four people to fight!" The youth's face showed disdain, not even looking at Wang Gang and others.

"You..." Hearing the youth's words, Mota and others became angry; this was their first time being looked down upon.

"Can't wait anymore; the Holy Son and Holy Daughter don't know when they'll return!" Wang Gang spoke solemnly, gazing at the four True Immortal Initial Stage deputy palace masters.

"Deputy Palace Master, let's choose four people to fight!" Wang Gang addressed the deputy palace masters above. After all, these were the ones in charge now.

"Wang Gang, Mota, Qiu Long, Hong Tao, you four..." A elder nodded, finally looking at them.

"Wait!" As the elder spoke halfway, someone interrupted him, causing the elder to be surprised. He looked at his side—Yu Tian.

"Roar..." A roar echoed, a massive figure appearing in the sky. The gray tortoise appeared in people's sight.

" Tortoise!" People gasped, gazing at the massive figure, eyes filled with awe.

"Who is on top of the Tortoise?" Soon people saw two figures atop it.

A man and a woman; the youth had a smile, his body radiating powerful strength, his face resolute. His gaze swept over the figures.

The woman was radiant, her face veiled by black silk; her robes rustled, and her purple eyes held a hint of amusement.

Though the youth's appearance wasn't particularly handsome, his body exuded a special aura, making them look perfectly matched.

"The Holy Son and Holy Daughter have arrived!" The Wheel Rotation disciples immediately became excited; Wang Gang and others sighed in relief.

"Is this a welcome for you or me?" Lo Tian smiled, addressing Fu Xingxuan beside him.

Half a year had passed for Lo Tian, as if he'd truly been in Hell. He didn't know how many times he had died and revived, but he knew this half-year hadn't been in vain. Yesterday, he'd finally broken through himself; his footwork was no longer a weakness.

"Of course it's for me! You don't have that charm!" Fu Xingxuan laughed lightly, making the sky pale. Many people were stunned.

"I've heard that the Wheel Rotation Temple's Holy Daughter is a national treasure; today I see it, though I haven't seen her true face, she's truly unmatched!" Other palaces' geniuses gazed with admiration at Fu Xingxuan.

"Please remove your veil, let us see her true face!" A big man spoke, his voice filled with greed, drooling.

Chapter 2177: Fan Tianyin

Hearing the big man's words, Lo Tian's brow slightly furrowed. Fu Xingxuan directly and strongly replied: "What are you?"

"Haha, Holy Daughter, don't meet me; if I do, I'll personally remove your veil!" The big man grinned sinisterly, not hiding his greed.

"You dare to meet me, I'll pluck out your eyes!" Lo Tian coldly replied. To insult Fu Xingxuan before him was not seeking a beating.

"Good kid, but you're not blowing it right!" The big man sneered, looking at Lo Tian. Though Lo Tian's entrance was special, it didn't affect his view of him as trash.

"Is this the one who killed my son and daughter?" Tian Gui Wang stood there, his eyes filled with fury, wanting to peel Lo Tian alive.

"Longyuan!" Ye Qiu stood still, feeling his sword Jueyun's excitement. His gaze swept over Lo Tian's back with the fiery red scabbard.

"Is it really him who killed my son?" Wang Tong stood solemnly, his eyes thoughtful.

With Lo Tian's appearance, he immediately drew most people's attention, all curious about this new Holy Son of the Wheel Rotation Temple.

Other palaces' Holy Sons hadn't met him, but they'd heard their names and some rumors. However, Lo Tian was unknown to them; they only knew he had rescued the Wheel Rotation Temple's important disciples with the Battle Platform and Cursed Mirror in the Reincarnation Realm.

In short, these were all hearsay; no one could confirm if they were rumors spread by the Wheel Rotation Temple to hype up Lo Tian.

"Quickly come up; don't waste time!" A cold voice echoed in people's ears. Shou Gui Wang, flanked by Tian Gui Wang, spoke coldly, gazing at Lo Tian with intense killing intent.

"This must be the Heavenly Ghost King Eight!" Lo Tian thought to himself, his gaze meeting Tian Gui Wang's. He felt the killing intent in Tian Gui Wang's eyes but ignored it; he knew even if Tian Gui Wang had ten chances, he wouldn't dare attack him at the Wheel Rotation Temple.

"Wang Xiong, Mota Xiong, Qiu Long Xiong, let's go up together, okay?" Lo Tian smiled, gazing at Wang Gang and others.

"Great!" Qiu Long laughed heartily, his eyes filled with excitement, gazing at the other palaces' geniuses.

"Am I not needed?" Fu Xingxuan's brow slightly furrowed, feeling uneasy. After all, the other palaces' people weren't simple.

"Women should stick to being beautiful; fighting is men's business!" Lo Tian took a step forward, leaping into the air and standing on the platform.

"Indeed, I value this man; do well and get first place. Sister will reward you tonight! Guarantee it'll make you feel heavenly!" Su Dan's face showed a hint of allure, addressing Lo Tian.

"Hmm?" As Su Dan's words finished, the Zun Gui Wang's gaze slightly darkened, scrutinizing Lo Tian.

Lo Tian immediately felt like a thorn in his back—not only from Zun Gui Wang's pressure but also Fu Xingxuan's gaze made him uncomfortable. However, Lo Tian maintained his smile and stood on the platform.

"Lo Brother is right!" Wang Gang, Qiu Long, Mota three also stood behind Lo Tian, their eyes filled with battle intent, gazing at the other palaces' geniuses.

As Lo Tian and four others stood on the platform, the forty geniuses of the Ten Palaces were finally complete. They gazed at each other, their battle intent radiating from them.

"Good luck, Lo Senior!" The Wheel Rotation disciples shouted, gazing at the four of them.

Although Lo Tian hadn't had a good impression before, he now represented the Wheel Rotation Temple; they still hoped to see it win first place.

Also, since they couldn't see the battle of the Immortal Kings, the Holy Son was the most watched. Few focused on the Immortal King battles.

"The Ten Teams are divided into two groups; each group must fight five matches to determine first to fifth place. Then comes the ranking battle, where each group faces another group's corresponding rank. Understood?"

"Understood!" They spoke, saying nothing. Though there might be some luck involved, sometimes luck is part of strength; without strength, how can there be luck? This method was relatively fair, allowing each team to fight four matches.

"If your group wins first place, the worst is second place!"

"Conversely, if fifth, you can only be in the last two!" Lo Tian understood, gazing at other palaces' people. Their strength was formidable.

Ten tokens appeared before Shou Gui Wang, who smiled slightly and addressed the crowd: "Now it's time to draw lots!"

Lo Tian stepped forward toward Shou Gui Wang, and other palaces also each sent a young man—clearly the Holy Sons.

Lo Tian extended his hand, and a token appeared in his palm; the token had one character. Other Holy Sons also grabbed tokens.

"One group, we're grouped with the Wheel Rotation Temple, hahaha!" A laugh echoed in the crowd.

"Yin Shen Palace, Fan Tianyin?" People immediately saw the speaker and understood.

The阎罗 Ten Palaces commonly regarded the Wheel Rotation Temple as the weakest, followed by Yin Shen Palace. They always ranked last; however, Yin Shen was slightly stronger than the Wheel Rotation Temple. People thought this time the Wheel Rotation Temple would still be last, and if Yin Shen was grouped with it, defeating the Wheel Rotation Temple would at least get eighth place.

"Gift group!" Other palaces, even Yin Shen, saw the Wheel Rotation Temple as a gift group.

"It seems we'll have a good rank this time!" A big man laughed, the one who had previously flirted with Fu Xingxuan, from the Equality Palace.

The other two palaces in the same group as the Wheel Rotation Temple were Huangtian Palace and Fengdu Palace, both strong; Fengdu had previously ranked first in the Ten Palace Grand Tournament.

"Alright, all groups are set; let's begin!"

"The first match: Wheel Rotation Temple vs. Yin Shen Palace, Shura Palace vs. Five Palaces!" Shou Gui Wang spoke.

Soon, the massive platform split into two parts. Lo Tian and four others stepped onto one platform; fluctuations erupted from Shou Gui Wang's four Heavenly Kings, surrounding them with domain power. Yin Shen Palace's four also appeared within the barrier.

"First win! This time we might not be last!" Fan Tianyin smiled, gazing at Lo Tian and others. His three men behind also showed contempt.

"Who knows, this Fan Tianyin has such superiority? Last place is last place..." Other non-participating palaces' geniuses were speechless at Fan Tianyin's arrogance.

"Nothing wrong; this time they won't be last place, maybe even third!" A young man sneered.

More people focused on the battle between Shura Palace and Five Palaces, as they were true strongholds.

"How to fight? Just fight randomly?" Lo Tian turned around, gazing at Wang Gang and others. He was a bit confused about the rules.

"Any method is allowed, as long as you win!" Wang Gang nodded, gazing at Fan Tianyin's four.

"Then it's simple!" Lo Tian smiled, drawing Longyuan and unleashing a violent aura. Yin Shen Palace's four showed concern.

"Longyuan, one of the Seven Fearsome Swords—indeed powerful; it gives me a sense of pressure!" Fan Tianyin's eyes showed concern, holding a black staff that emitted dark light.

"I'll take care of them!" Lo Tian leaped into the air, slashing a sword at Fan Tianyin.

The sky roared with massive sword energy, rushing toward Fan Tianyin's group and cutting through everything. It instantly arrived before them.

"Relying solely on a sword you can't fully control won't beat me!"

"I'll take care of this Lo Chen; the other three, you deal with them!" Fan Tianyin sneered, his black staff exploding toward the red sword energy.

"Crack..." Thunderous roars echoed as Fan Tianyin's body retreated two steps, his eyes showing surprise.

"Indeed has some moves!" Lo Tian smiled lightly, leaping into the air toward Fan Tianyin. Fan Tianyin no longer looked down on him, his black staff swirling powerfully as he clashed with Lo Tian.

"Kill..." Wang Gang, Mota, and Qiu Long three's eyes were filled with battle intent. The previous geniuses had looked at them like trash, which made them very angry and filled with resentment.

The collision sounds kept echoing; the platform became chaotic. Besides the Wheel Rotation Temple's disciples, many also observed Shura Palace and Five Palaces' battle; few paid attention to Lo Tian's group.

"The Holy Son has subdued Fan Tianyin, making him spit blood!" Still, some people watched Lo Tian's group, occasionally shouting in amazement.

"Wang Senior, Mota Senior has also subdued the three from Tianyin Palace!" Soon, Wheel Rotation Temple's disciples watching Lo Tian's group became even more excited.

"Chicken fighting!"

"Not interesting; the only one to fear is Longyuan Sword!" Other palaces' observers glanced briefly at their battle, were surprised, then shifted their attention.

Lo Tian was strong; with his current strength, even True Immortal Peak had no match. Even if he faced True Immortal Peak, he dared to fight—though the result was unknown.

Thus, Fan Tianyin naturally met his fate; if not for his staff's non-ordinary nature and his skilled staff techniques, he would have been defeated by Lo Tian's sword.

"How could he be so strong!" Fan Tianyin's heart was terrified, his body constantly retreating. He hadn't expected to face this Lo Chen and had no chance to counterattack.

Chapter 2178: Yin Shen Nine Transformations

On the spacious platform, four groups continuously clashed. The battle between Shura Palace and Five Palaces drew most people's attention, but the Wheel Rotation Temple vs. Yin Shen Palace battle was equally thrilling.

"Suddenly stronger!" Su Dan, Mo Cheng, and Fu Xingxuan stood there, gazing at Lo Tian subduing Fan Tianyin. Their eyes showed admiration.

"What did he go through in these six months?" They then turned their gaze to Fu Xingxuan, as they had both emerged at the same time.

"Little Sister Xingxuan, have you been with Lo Chen these six months? Have you already..." Su Dan smiled, gazing at Fu Xingxuan.

Su Dan's words made Fu Xingxuan's face slightly red, though her face was veiled by black silk. Her eyes showed some shyness.

"Really?" Seeing Fu Xingxuan's expression, his face showed disbelief.

"How beastly! Even the Holy Daughter!" They all sighed internally; each had a soft spot for the Holy Daughter but hadn't expected Lo Tian to get there first.

"Also, Su Dan, they seem to have a relationship..." They looked at Su Dan and Fu Xingxuan standing together, speechless.

Su Dan's face paled slightly; she gazed at Fu Xingxuan, not expecting her joke to make Fu Xingxuan admit it.

"Really?" Su Dan's body slightly trembled, his gaze became more solemn; she knew Fu Xingxuan well. Fu Xingxuan's admission meant nine out of ten was true.

"Yes, we've already had marital relations! We're waiting for this tournament to finish and apply to the Palace Master for marriage!" Fu Xingxuan sighed lightly, looking at Su Dan's expression. She felt uncomfortable but admitted it anyway.

She didn't want Su Dan to fall deeper, which would only make things harder. She had walked this path before and didn't want Su Dan to repeat it; it was too painful.

"Congratulations, Xingxuan finally has someone to marry!" Su Dan smiled with her trademark smile, addressing Fu Xingxuan.

"I feel unwell; I'll go back to rest!" Su Dan then laughed lightly, addressing them.

"Su Dan, are you okay?" Fu Xingxuan's eyes showed concern, gazing at Su Dan. She felt Su Dan's state was off.

"Nothing wrong! Just uninteresting!" Su Dan smiled lightly, gazing at Lo Tian's battle. She stepped out of the crowd.

"Sorry, though it's cruel for you, he is my husband!" Fu Xingxuan silently told herself, her eyes showing guilt.

Lo Tian was unaware of the events below the platform; he kept attacking Fan Tianyin, who had been beaten into spitting blood. The collision sounds echoed between them.

Fan Tianyin's body slammed against the barrier, spitting blood, his eyes showing weakness. He gazed at Lo Tian approaching him.

"Yin Shen Nine Transformations!" Fan Tianyin roared, his aura surging. His body radiated fierce power.

"Ah? Body strength enhanced? But it's useless!" Lo Tian swung his sword again, the fiery red blade cutting against the black staff. Sparks flew as Fan Tianyin's body was pushed back, colliding with the barrier again.

"Second transformation... third transformation..." Fan Tianyin slid down from the barrier, his eyes showing madness. His body emitted a crackling sound, and wind surged from him, increasing his power seven times.

"Boom..." Finally, Fan Tianyin's aura reached its peak; a black dragon coiled around him, obscuring his face.

"Body! Immortal King Peak!" Lo Tian's eyes were serious, gazing at Fan Tianyin's overwhelming aura. His eyes flashed with purple light, seeing through the mist to see Fan Tianyin's body covered in cracks and twisted face.

"Buzz..." As Lo Tian marveled, Fan Tianyin moved, his aura like a storm. His body collapsed the void and appeared before Lo Tian. The black staff suddenly smashed down.

Lo Tian raised his sword to meet the black staff, a thunderous collision echoing within the barrier. Lo Tian's body trembled; the massive sword was smashed onto his shoulder, causing cracks beneath him. His shoulder lost sensation.

"Now, what do you think?" Fan Tianyin's face was grotesque; his aura hadn't changed. The black staff raised again, smashing down on Lo Tian.

"Not good!" Lo Tian moved his hands, his body rapidly growing. He recited the蛮神战歌 (Fierce God Battle Song), and an invisible aura radiated from him, making a thousand-foot giant appear like a celestial being.

"Haha, this feeling is great!" Qiu Long, Wang Gang, and Mota three were also wrapped in the蛮文 (Fierce Script), their power rising again. Their strength had already subdued the opponent, now increasing further.

"What is this martial art?" Lo Tian's massive body immediately drew people's attention, their faces showing shock as they gazed at him.

"Finally forcing Fan Tianyin to use Yin Shen Nine Transformations, and it's already at the eighth transformation! Seems the Wheel Rotation Temple's Holy Son isn't weak!"

"But this Yin Shen Nine Transformations, though powerful, has a major drawback: each transformation adds thirty seconds of time. After thirty seconds, it will exhaust itself!"
