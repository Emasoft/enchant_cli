“Breaking through among these prodigies is exceedingly difficult, yet if one can endure until the end, they may shatter their constraints and ascend as the Master of the Epoch—perhaps even the mightiest in history!” The elder spoke softly, clearly favoring Luo Tian, for his current performance suggested invincibility at his level.

“Senior, do you have a method to counter the Heavenly Dao’s suppression?” Luo Tian shook his head. Without removing the character of guilt on his back, he could not even reach the middle stage of a Sage.

“There is none. Only in my prime could I contest the Heavenly Dao; now, I am powerless. You must rely on yourself. Though my memories are incomplete, perhaps there is another way. Trials are inevitable on the path of cultivation—view this as one such trial,” the elder said with a light laugh.

Luo Tian’s lips twitched, his mind sighing inwardly: “This trial is too harsh—even a fallen Epoch Master could not overcome it!”

“Enough. Strive, young one. I hope one day you become the Epoch Master; then perhaps I may yet see the light of day. This Epoch Scripture must be preserved—each Epoch Master’s exclusive artifact. Its mysteries will become clear when you possess the complete one,” the elder said, his voice soothing as he gazed upon Luo Tian with hope.

After speaking, the elder left Luo Tian in stunned silence within his mind-sea, absorbing the elder’s words.

“Step by step,” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his voice tinged with resignation. The great era was approaching; the path ahead would surely grow more treacherous, adding urgency to his heart.

“By the way,” the elder’s voice echoed from the Epoch Scripture, “when I forged this ancient Heaven Palace, I cultivated four spirit-essences. The three elders in the first three layers were the secondary ones; the third was the primary spirit-essence. I wonder how it has grown over these years. If you encounter it, attempt to claim this ancient Heaven Palace—provided you gain the primary spirit-essence’s approval.”

“Luo Tian…” The voices of Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi resonated in Luo Tian’s ears, pulling him back to reality.

At that moment, more figures appeared within the hall—Yao Domain, Divine Clan, and Du Hongtao among them. Their faces bore joy as they emerged from the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram, their qi vibrant and powerful, some even bearing the aura of recent ascension.

Luo Tian surveyed them briefly, recalling the elder’s words within the Epoch Scripture. He sighed inwardly: “Is this truly the great era?”

These young prodigies were undoubtedly rare talents, all born within this epoch—uncommon indeed.

“Only Sun Mengru, Feng Jiutian, and Zhou Wei remain,” the crowd’s faces bore a touch of tension. They knew one of these three might claim the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram.

“Where is Long Jie?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, scanning the room. Though his bloodline power assured Long Jie’s safety, a quiet worry lingered.

“Ah-choo!” A sneeze echoed. Long Jie, his face listless, gazed at the eighteen elders and middle-aged men surrounding him.

“Elder… elder! Why are you here!” Two elders at the peak of Sagehood stared at Long Jie, their faces etched with disbelief, as if witnessing a ghost.

“I told you—I’m not Long Zhan Tian. How many times must I explain before you believe me!” Long Jie’s youthful face bore impatience, shouting at the eighteen men.

It was too annoying. Long Jie had been flung into the fifth layer of the ancient Heaven Palace by the fourth-layer guardian, landing amidst eighteen powerful elders. His heart trembled; he turned to flee.

But in an instant, two peak Sage elders seized him, their faces alight with joy, crying out “Elder!” in tears—enough to terrify Long Jie.

“Elder, have you reincarnated? You don’t recognize us?” The two peak Sage elders gazed at Long Jie, their faces filled with confusion.

“Not mistaken—it’s Elder Long!” The eighteen men scrutinized Long Jie, confirming his identity. “Why was you betrayed?”

“Betrayed,” Long Jie shrugged indifferently, his clear eyes flashing a hint of hatred.

“What?” The hall fell silent. Seventeen powerhouses radiated coldness, their faces icy; only one remained calm.

“Hmph. Who dares betray him? Rest assured, we’ll accompany you to exterminate his entire clan!” The two peak Sage elders spoke coldly.

“Annihilate the nine clans!” Others echoed, their voices resolute—clearly lawless men.

“Second elder, don’t say such crude things. Brother Nine is here!” Two elders with late Sage strength spoke, their menacing aura sending shivers.

“Ah… I didn’t mean you two. Who made you two bear and leopard clans!” The peak Sage elder’s face turned awkward.

Hearing their words, Long Jie’s clear eyes flickered slightly, as if recalling something. He sighed softly.

“Alright, with this ancient Heaven Palace opened, will you go out or stay?” Long Jie shook his head, acknowledging his identity as Long Zhan Tian—after all, so many called him that, and his memories did hold fragments of Long Zhan Tian’s past.

Hearing Long Jie’s words, the hall fell silent. Their gazes turned to the golden altar, nodding slightly: “Perhaps our talent was insufficient; we never grasped that Epoch Mark!”

The eighteen men shook their heads, their eyes filled with disappointment. Each looked dispirited.

Through his memories, Long Jie understood their origins. He lightly patted the shoulders of two peak Sage elders: “Try again. The world has changed—perhaps you’ll succeed!”

“We lack your talent, Elder,” they shook their heads. “But the three spirit-essences said this ancient Heaven Palace may soon have a master. We don’t wish to live under others’ roofs—this is why we chose to leave.”

They all shook their heads, but then gazed at Long Jie with bright eyes.

“But Elder, if you become the master of this ancient Heaven Palace, we needn’t leave. Whenever you require us, simply shake the ancient Heaven Palace—our forces will rush out and shatter them!” They all spoke, their voices filled with hope.

“Indeed! Who else but Elder could be the master of this ancient Heaven Palace!” A dozen men spoke, their voices tinged with anticipation.

Only one remained silent when the topic arose, his gaze flickering toward Long Jie without the others’ warmth.

“I’ve found a better candidate for this ancient Heaven Palace’s master,” Long Jie smiled at the dozen men, his youthful face alight with amusement.

Chapter 989: Immortal Blood Phoenix

Within the fourth layer of the Ancient Heaven Palace, Luo Tian and others gazed at the ancient, mystical diagram suspended in the sky. Their faces bore anticipation, eager to see who would claim the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram.

“Not Zhou Wei again? If he wins this, it’d be too absurd!” The crowd murmured, their voices laced with expectation.

“Unlikely. A pseudo-Epoch Treasure—acquiring one is already a great fortune. Like how Luo Tian obtained the Epoch Bell, Bloodthirsty Magic Sword, and Heavenly Mechanism Diagram—none chose him.”

“But the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram is indeed powerful. I ascended to the early Sage stage within it. Others also gained much!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s face bore excitement, his gaze fixed on the diagram. His aura was formidable, clearly having reached early Sage.

Seeing Nan Gong Yuqing’s excitement, Luo Tian felt a stir. He had once promised the elder of Tiger Fortress to visit the Demon Clan when he and Nan Gong Yuqing reached Sage. The elder had said that demon clan elders rarely interfered with their own kin, allowing the three clans to fight among themselves. Thus, they let them clash under strength.

“After this Ancient Heaven Palace affair, we should visit the Demon Clan,” Luo Tian said to Nan Gong Yuqing, his eyes confident.

In Tiger Fortress, he had heard the elder say that the Demon Clan’s leader was at mid-Sage. With his current strength, he could easily face a mid-Sage. Nan Gong Yuqing was the same. Perhaps the elder had advanced to mid-Sage in recent years, and without interference from late Sage elders, they could likely seize the leader’s position. Plus, Luo Tian had further plans—The Illusory Divine Demon Flower.

“Only to fear are the Demon Clan’s elders. How many would support Nan Gong Yuqing?” Luo Tian pondered.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian mused, the sky blazed with radiant light, illuminating the entire hall. A surreal scene appeared above.

“Is that Feng Jiutian! Sun Mengru and Zhou Wei too!” The crowd gasped, gazing at the sky in astonishment.

At that moment, they saw three figures atop a mountain peak, locked in battle. Terrifying waves seemed to destroy an entire small world.

Simultaneously, beneath the three, a golden mountain radiated golden light. The three’s powerful waves had no effect on it.

“I see! Whoever comprehends that small world will be transported to the golden mountain. That golden mountain is the core of the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram—every small world within it originates from that golden mountain!” Long Yu Huan of the Dragon Clan’s face lit with excitement. He had read this in Long Zhan Tian’s notes.

“Long Jie would’ve been ideal. If he were here, this Heavenly Mechanism Diagram might be his!” Xu Liyi and others frowned, disappointment on their faces.

“Hmph. Not likely. He already took a pseudo-Epoch Treasure—his fortune was great enough. To steal my guarded Heavenly Mechanism Diagram, I’d have to be mad!” The plump elder spoke with oiliness, appearing beside Chen Zhanbiao.

The crowd gazed at the elder oddly. They could sense a hint of resentment in his voice, wondering what Long Zhan Tian had done to anger him so.

“Long Jie is Long Zhan Tian!” The Yao Domain people caught the key points of their conversation, their faces stunned.

“Elder Dragon is still alive!” Long Yu Huan’s face bore shock, his eyes gleaming.

“Absolutely. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have felt such overwhelming pressure—unable to move!” The Yao Domain’s people shuddered. If this news spread, it would shake the Eight Great Sage Clans.

“Once a Dragon Elder, now the domain’s master—this youth!” The Divine Clan people were also stunned. This news was too shocking; if it reached the Divine Clan, their God-King would not sit idle.

“Unfortunately, he hasn’t regained Long Zhan Tian’s former strength. Even if he did, this era doesn’t belong to him. If he had continued training since his prime, he might have become an Epoch Sage. But now, a half-step Sage—retraining would leave him far behind the domain masters. Even Diao Yuanshan is stronger than he was back then!” The crowd murmured, eventually shaking their heads.

“Not necessarily. With the world in upheaval, maybe Elder Dragon will rise again. We must be cautious. Even now, the pressure of his bloodline has left us helpless. If he truly grows, even a mid-Sage would be a threat to the Eight Great Sage Clans!” The Yao Domain people whispered, discussing how to spread this news beyond the palace.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, observing everyone’s expressions. Especially when he saw the Yao Domain members’ eyes flickering with hidden hostility, Luo Tian’s own resolve stirred. Yet he quickly suppressed it.

Diao Yuanshan was formidable, and with his protection, Luo Tian didn’t believe anyone could threaten Long Jie under Diao Yuanshan’s watch.

“Battle is ending!” Diao Dezhu spoke, drawing everyone’s attention back to the sky.

“Feng Jiutian has reached early Sage!” Luo Tian observed, his mind shaken. Feng Jiutian had grown immensely stronger—perhaps even surpassing himself. After transforming into his true form, his golden feathers turned blood-red, appearing eerie and sinister. The crimson feathers formed countless blood-red swords, slicing through the void toward Sun Mengru and Zhou Wei.

“Immortal Blood Phoenix! Feng Jiutian has completed the Nine Transformations of Nirvana, becoming an Immortal Blood Phoenix!” The Yao Domain people were stunned, gazing at Feng Jiutian’s overwhelming aura.

“None of them are easy opponents!” Tian Luo spoke, watching the three battle. His and Xiu’s entry into early Sage had been too late; they lagged behind others.

Sun Mengru wielded unparalleled divine arts, her aura radiant and regal. She became a sovereign of a world, her golden protective light repelling the blood-red swords that could slay early Sage.

Simultaneously, Sun Mengru’s hands glowed with golden light. Her sword surged in size, its sharpness sending chills even beyond the scene, as if slicing through a small world toward Feng Jiutian and Zhou Wei.

Zhou Wei was equally formidable. Facing their attacks, he showed no fear. His hands moved in tandem, drawing constellations into a perfect diagram that absorbed the blood-red swords. He then unleashed supreme secret texts, aiming to subdue both.

All three were prodigies at early Sage, capable of defeating mid-Sage. Their battles sent tremors through the world, yet not a single blade or leaf in that small world was harmed—amazing.

“Truly a pseudo-Epoch Treasure! Such powerful attacks could not harm it at all!” The three factions watched anxiously, hoping their disciples would claim the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram.

“I withdraw!” Zhou Wei shook his head. Seeing Sun Mengru and Feng Jiutian’s bloodlust, he smiled without using the Bloodthirsty Magic Sword. After all, the fourth-layer guardian had warned that not drinking an enemy’s blood would retaliate against its master.

Zhou Wei chose to withdraw without reason. Everyone could see he was still capable of fighting, having not used the Bloodthirsty Magic Sword.

The waves spread. Zhou Wei smiled, vanishing from the golden mountain into view.

Seeing so many people, Zhou Wei’s face slightly stiffened. He noticed Luo Tian still at early Sage, his brows furrowed. He had observed Luo Tian’s cultivation was complete and ready to ascend to mid-Sage. In the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram, a year equaled one outside—perfect for breaking through barriers.

Yet Zhou Wei felt some relief upon seeing Luo Tian’s calm aura. Though he hadn’t ascended, his presence was more unfathomable. He had become a sword sheathed in its scabbard, an ultimate weapon waiting to be drawn—when it was, it would shake the heavens.

“Zhou Xiong…” Luo Tian had a good impression of Zhou Wei, especially his various tactics.

“Luo Xiong’s strength has improved again!” Zhou Wei smiled as always, greeting Luo Tian before returning to his group.

“Only two remain.” The Divine and Yao Domain people bore excitement. Whoever won would likely claim the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram—unavoidable excitement. Luo Tian had obtained one, Zhou Wei another; this left the Yao and Divine Domains embarrassed, as they ranked second and third but let other domains take the lead.

Under everyone’s expectant gaze, the two fought fiercely. Golden light and blood qi entwined, leaving people awestruck—especially Feng Jiutian, whose strength could now match Sun Mengru. If not for her divine body, she would have already lost.

Chapter 990: Seized

Within the Ancient Heaven Palace, everyone gazed at the sky’s scene with admiration. Though they couldn’t feel the battle’s waves, they could sense the immense power of the martial arts displayed.

“Ten Directions Sacred Earth!” Sun Mengru roared, tearing open the heavens. Golden light spilled from cracks, like golden sand flowing out, rushing toward Feng Jiutian.

“It’s sacred earth from beyond the domain! The Divine Clan’s God-King obtained it from a secret technique. Only ten measures exist. Each grain of sand rivals the weight of an entire continent. If it struck a person, they’d be crushed to dust instantly.” The Divine Clan people spoke confidently, gazing at the golden sand.

“It’s a fragment of an Epoch Treasure forged by an Epoch Master!” The fourth-layer guardian elder said, his face showing surprise as he gazed at the golden sand.

“Sss…” Gasps echoed from people’s mouths, their bodies trembling as they watched the golden sand pour from the sky.

Even Luo Tian trembled. He hadn’t expected Sun Mengru to possess such a technique. After thinking, he realized whether he could withstand the golden sand’s pressure. He was bitterly disappointed to find he would be crushed and vomited blood.

“Epoch Masters are truly formidable. Even fragments of their treasures are so overwhelming. If they were actual Epoch Treasures, what power would they hold!” Luo Tian marveled, gazing at the golden palace. Without the elder’s introduction in the Epoch Scripture, he would have seen it as a death trap.

“Phoenix Nirvana—True Soul Immortal!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened. The terrifying pressure left no room for resistance. Though his ancestor, the Phoenix Clan’s elder, had given him a formidable secret technique, it still fell short of Sun Mengru’s Ten Directions Sacred Earth.

Yet Feng Jiutian dared to fight Sun Mengru, for he had his own strength. His body radiated blood qi, a red stream of blood bursting from his body and enveloping him.

In an instant, Feng Jiutian shrank into a blood-red egg. Crimson patterns flowed across the egg’s surface.

“Hmph, I didn’t expect Feng Jiutian to truly complete the Nine Transformations of Nirvana. He’s become immortal!” Diao Dezhu spoke in admiration, gazing at the blood-red egg.

“Is it strong?” Xu Liyi and others asked, sensing the egg’s uniqueness and the power of the Nine Transformations.

“The Nine Transformations of Nirvana—immortality! It’s a secret technique passed down only within the Phoenix Clan. Even if it were revealed, no one else could master it—only the Phoenix Clan can! Legends say that those who complete it are nearly unbeatable at their level!” Diao Dezhu spoke slowly, his voice heavy with concern.

People were stunned. They hadn’t expected such a miraculous technique—like an immortal body, casting a shadow over their minds.

“Is there no way to counter it?” The crowd doubted, gazing at Diao Dezhu with questioning eyes.

Luo Tian was also deeply concerned. Such a miraculous technique made him marvel at the strength of the great clans’ sanctuaries. The Four Sacred Stars and Fire Domain were indeed shallow in their foundations.

“There’s no absolute, but the Phoenix Clan’s technique can be countered. One is by extreme attack methods to crush it; two, kill it before it completes the Nine Transformations of Nirvana!” Diao Dezhu spoke softly.

“How? Feng Jiutian is a prodigy. Now he’s an Immortal Blood Phoenix, his qi strong and powerful. Who in his level could wield a technique to break this defense!” People’s faces bore disappointment.

“Impossible? My ancestor of the Yellower Ghost Clan once countered it with extreme speed, breaking it before it completed the transformation!” Diao Dezhu’s face showed pride.

“Also, the Fire Domain had a great sage who countered a Phoenix Clan sage’s Nine Transformations of Nirvana with extreme methods. His name was Gu Tianshu! It is said his attack power was unmatched, capable of tripling his own strength. Unbelievable!” Diao Dezhu then turned his gaze to Luo Tian, knowing he had a powerful attack technique that could triple his strength.

“Even Elder Dragon Long Zhan Tian once used supreme methods to nearly kill a Phoenix Clan sage, securing the Fire Domain’s domain master position!” Diao Dezhu spoke softly, leaving people stunned.

“I remember our Starry Sky Domain once had a supreme sage who countered this Nirvana technique!” Zhou Wei smiled calmly, leaving people gasping.

“Each domain has its supreme methods. Thus, no technique is invincible!” The fourth-layer guardian elder spoke, his voice reflective. Having guarded the fourth layer for countless years, he had seen many prodigies and spoke with authority.

“Who is stronger—Sun Mengru’s Ten Directions Sacred Earth or Feng Jiutian’s secret technique of Nine Transformations of Nirvana?” The Starry Sky Domain people asked, gazing at the image in the sky.

Sun Mengru’s face changed. She formed seals with her hands, infusing golden symbols into the golden sand, turning the blood-red egg into gold. The powerful refining force refined Feng Jiutian within the egg.

“Crack…” Cracking sounds echoed. The golden egg gradually showed cracks, and golden sand fell from the sky onto the golden mountain, producing thunderous sounds. The once-unmoving golden mountain finally trembled and sank.

“Buzz…” The ancient diagram emitted a buzzing sound, light spreading everywhere, illuminating the entire hall.

“Is it breaking?” The Yao Domain people’s hearts rose to their throats. They no longer worried if Feng Jiutian would obtain the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram but feared his death. They had clearly seen the egg’s cracks.

The ancient diagram gradually calmed, and the image reappeared in people’s sight. They then witnessed a scene that made their lips twitch.

In the image, Feng Jiutian’s transformed egg was riddled with cracks. Sun Mengru, like a divine beauty, had a pale face but instantly appeared before the sand-wrapped egg. Her jade foot lifted and kicked the seemingly fragile egg.

“Crack…” The golden egg emitted another crack, but it didn’t break. However, under Sun Mengru’s powerful kick, it was kicked down from the golden mountain.

“Truly resilient. Even this doesn’t break—no wonder it’s a secret technique of the Phoenix Clan!” People smiled, murmuring.

“An esteemed phoenix prodigy was kicked like a ball!” Xu Liyi and others spoke without restraint, but secretly admired Feng Jiutian’s formidable defense.

“Buzz…” The buzzing returned. Golden sand fell, and blood-red eggs flew from the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram. Crimson flames erupted from the eggshell, golden shells slowly cracked, and blood qi surged as Feng Jiutian emerged in people’s sight.

Blood-red feathers, his large phoenix eyes showed exhaustion. He had clearly expended much energy defending against the golden sand.

Feng Jiutian transformed into human form, his face dark. He gazed at the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram in the sky and glared coldly at Sun Mengru’s image, gritting his teeth.

“Haha!” The Divine Clan people laughed heartily, their joy at its peak. With Feng Jiutian kicked out, the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram now had only Sun Mengru.

Luo Tian sighed deeply. The Heavenly Mechanism Diagram was mysterious; he hoped Sun Mengru would obtain it, as it was a life-saving technique.

In the image, Sun Mengru finally showed a hint of joy. She soared upward, golden sand surrounding her perfect body. With one step, grains of sand fell from the sky onto the ground, raising large dust clouds.

“What is she doing? That’s sacred earth—why throw it away!” People bore confusion, puzzled why Sun Mengru would discard such an important sacred earth into the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram.

“She has great ambition!” The fourth-layer guardian elder’s eyes gleamed, gazing at Sun Mengru.

“She intends to integrate the sacred earth into the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram. Perhaps, in the future, it may have a chance to be forged into an actual Epoch Treasure!” Zhou Wei’s eyes flashed with brilliance.

“Such ambition!” People bore shock, gazing at Sun Mengru. They hadn’t expected her to be so willing to sacrifice.

“Buzz…” Golden light slowly rose. Sun Mengru placed the last handful of sacred earth on the golden mountain, her hands emitting radiant light that flew in all directions.

“Boom… Boom…” The golden mountain rose, growing rapidly. The towering ancient trees also grew continuously.

“One thousand zhang… Two thousand zhang…” Originally, the golden mountain was one thousand zhang high. But with Sun Mengru’s forging, it soared to two thousand zhang.

The Heavenly Mechanism Diagram in the hall emitted radiant light again, blindingly bright. The diagram that had covered the entire hall suddenly shrank.

Sun Mengru, bathed in golden holy light, appeared like a divine beauty. The Heavenly Mechanism Diagram hovered above her head, slowly descending to the size of a palm and landing gently in her hands.

“Got it!” The Divine Clan people rejoiced, gazing at Sun Mengru’s Heavenly Mechanism Diagram. They all laughed again.

Chapter 991: The Final Layer

Within the fourth layer of the Ancient Heaven Palace, Sun Mengru stood resplendent in the sky, holding the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram. Her face bore a smile, making the entire grand hall lose its color.

“Divine Lady, she… she’s smiling!” Sun Feiwen looked stunned, gazing at Sun Mengru in disbelief.

“Seems the Divine Lady hasn’t smiled since she grew up!” The Divine Clan people were also astonished. They hadn’t seen Sun Mengru smile in years.

“Smile that captivates a city!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but admire, gazing at Sun Mengru. He saw the image of Chen Yunting from his past.

The Divine Clan people were naturally elated. Obtaining the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram, and even having a chance to enter the Epoch Treasure level—how could they not be elated?

Compared to the Divine Clan’s joy, the Yao Domain people were gloomy. Their faces bore disappointment as they exchanged glances.

Now four factions remained, but only the Yao Domain had no pseudo-Epoch Treasures. They had gained some strength improvements, but no other rewards.

Compared to their strength gains, their losses were more severe. A group of over ten people now had only five remaining—clearly a poor exchange.

“Damn it!” Feng Jiutian’s face was also dark. He scanned the three—Luo Tian, Sun Mengru, and Zhou Wei. Now he could match any of them.

“Why? Feng Jiutian, are you challenging again? Reaching early Sage and becoming overconfident?” Diao Dezhu stood at the front of the crowd, his eyes filled with battle intent as he gazed at Feng Jiutian.

“Diao Dezhu!” Feng Jiutian saw Diao Dezhu, his face darkened. Upon realizing he was also at early Sage, his expression turned grim.

The Yellower Ghost Clan was deep and unfathomable. Though Diao Dezhu often appeared lazy and loved to show off, if it were a one-on-one fight, Feng Jiutian had no confidence in defeating him.

Then Feng Jiutian turned his gaze to others. Nan Gong Yuqing had also reached early Sage—no easy opponent. Even the Demon Clan’s prince, Nan Gong Feibai, had fallen to him.

Chen Zhanbiao radiated golden light, his powerful body terrifying. Xiu and Tian Luo, as well as Xu Liyi, also radiated strong waves.

The Divine Clan people were the same. Sun Feiwen had reached early Sage, his light overshadowed by Sun Mengru, but there was no doubt he was as formidable as Diao Dezhu. Starry Sky Domain was even more mysterious, making people wary.

In contrast, their side had five people. Though they were at early Sage and powerful, if they clashed with another faction, it would result in mutual destruction—perhaps even their deaths. Plus, Luo Tian’s three factions seemed to have a hint of alliance, like in the third layer.

Sun Mengru landed on the ground, her face returning to coldness. She stored the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram and bore a trace of nostalgia.

“Let’s go. Let’s see what the final layer holds!” Sun Mengru addressed the Divine Clan people, not greeting Luo Tian or Zhou Wei. She led her group into the golden door.

“Haha, I’ll go first. Wait for me in the next layer!” The elder patted Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulder, still holding a piece of roasted meat in his hand. He devoured it and vanished.

Luo Tian and others knew there was nothing left to linger in the fourth layer. They stepped into the golden door.

Zhou Wei and Feng Jiutian of two domains also disappeared from the fourth layer’s space.

The waves spread. In an instant, everyone appeared in another hall. After observing the scene, they were stunned.

“Damn! So many people!” A bold voice echoed through the hall.

As the voice rang out, sharp gazes like golden lightning swept over them. The people felt uncomfortable.

Luo Tian and others were startled by the bold voice. Their gazes turned to a tall altar in their view, radiating waves that terrified them.

Most astonishing was the nineteen figures beneath the altar—each like a primordial beast, their qi terrifyingly powerful.

Especially, eighteen figures surrounded one young figure at the center, gazing at him with reverence.

That figure was none other than Long Jie, who had disappeared in the third layer of the Ancient Heaven Palace.

“Damn! Who are these people? I feel like any one of them could beat us several times!” Xu Liyi’s lips twitched, gazing at the eighteen powerful figures.

“Early Sage peak!” Luo Tian was also stunned, gazing at the eighteen figures surrounding Long Jie. His eyes bore concern.

“Elder!” Long Jie’s youthful face showed a smile as he walked through the crowd to Luo Tian and others, greeting them.

“Hey! Long Jie, who are these people? How did you know so many fierce ones!” Xu Liyi’s face bore disbelief, gazing at Long Jie.

“They’re not anyone—Long Zhan Tian’s subordinates!” Long Jie shrugged, gazing at the eighteen figures.

“Subordinates…” Even Luo Tian’s lips twitched. His eyes bore disbelief as he gazed at the eighteen figures.

“These eighteen people could match a regular sect’s Sage Clan!” Zhou Wei spoke, his face showing admiration as he gazed at the eighteen figures. If these eighteen entered any sect’s Sage Clan, they would surely bolster its strength.

Two early Sage peaks! Six late Sage stages! Ten mid-Sage levels! Hmph, truly…

Xu Liyi and others were seeing early Sage peaks for the first time. They sighed in awe.

“Why so many people? Isn’t it only one or two who can enter this layer?” Luo Tian and others observed the eighteen figures while they, too, observed them.

“Good!” Two early Sage elders nodded, speaking softly with approval.

“Hmph. Who rang the ninth bell of the Epoch?” A burly man stepped out from the eighteen figures, his face curious.

“Respectful junior!” Luo Tian and Sun Mengru stepped forward, bowing to the eighteen figures with respect. He could sense these eighteen were prodigies and elders.
