“Wrath of the Moon Goddess!” As Luo Tian turned, a frenzied voice echoed beneath the starry sky.

“Hum…” A streak of violet light suddenly appeared on Luo Tian’s back, causing everyone’s faces to shift in alarm.

“You…” As Luo Tian turned, he felt a warm sensation on his back—a pair of jade-like hands wrapped around his waist, making Luo Tian’s expression darken.

“Live well!” A gentle voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, exuding a fragrant breath that continuously brushed against his face.

“Damn it! Is she seeking death?” Jin Yangxi’s expression turned grim. He hadn’t expected Fu Xingxuan, who had been fighting him, to suddenly change form and charge toward Luo Tian.

“Return!” Xue Shengfei and Tu Feiyang’s faces also shifted abruptly, attempting to stop their martial arts. If Fu Xingxuan fell, the Star-Moon Divine Clan would likely go mad.

But their martial arts were too fast; everything happened in an instant, leaving no time to stop it.

“Please hold on!” Jin Yangxi whispered, his eyes filled with disbelief as Fu Xingxuan embraced Luo Tian from behind. He hadn’t expected Fu Xingxuan to be so devoted, risking her life. Jin Yangxi knew Fu Xingxuan must have used a forbidden martial technique, as her speed was beyond reason. Hence, he had allowed her to charge through his forces.

Luo Tian’s face was wild as he pushed Xiao Qian forward, trying to turn back. But Fu Xingxuan clung tightly to him.

“Pf…” Warm blood splattered onto Luo Tian’s face as two crimson blades pierced Fu Xingxuan’s shoulders. This was due to Xue Shengfei and Tu Feiyang altering their direction; otherwise, the blades would have pierced her vital points, leaving no chance of survival.

“Hum…” The crimson blades embedded in Fu Xingxuan’s shoulders radiated red light, emitting a terrifying suction force.

Under this immense pull, waves of blood energy surged from Fu Xingxuan’s body into the crimson blades, causing her face to pale instantly.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian suddenly turned, gazing at Fu Xingxuan’s pale face with regret. He could feel her condition was deteriorating rapidly; the blood energy was vanishing at an alarming rate, already losing a third of her vitality.

“Boom…” However, Yu Fantian’s attack was no simple matter; a thunderous blade slashed down directly onto Fu Xingxuan’s body.

Blood mist spread as Fu Xingxuan’s condition was already declining. After being struck by Yu Fantian’s full-force attack, she couldn’t withstand it and was instantly reduced to a blood mist, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

Even more terrifying was that Tu Feiyang and Xue Shengfei’s Soul-Devouring Spears, which never returned until they drained their enemy’s blood. The dissipating mist was instantly absorbed by the two crimson blades.

A gray soul drifted in the starry sky, appearing before Luo Tian with a faint smile, seeming unusually ethereal.

“Live happily! You saved me several times; this time, I return the favor!” Fu Xingxuan’s gray soul whispered before beginning to twist and be absorbed by the suction force of the crimson blades.

“No!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned blood-red as he stared at the illusory soul and roared.

“Damn it!” Tu Feiyang’s group turned grim, Xue Shengfei shouting at Luo Tian: “Save the soul! Once a Soul-Devouring Spear strikes, it never returns!”

“Come back!” Luo Tian roared to the heavens, his body radiating a pressure targeting souls. His hands moved, sending invisible waves toward the soul twisting toward the Soul-Devouring Spear.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s other hand erupted with a punch that struck the hovering crimson blade.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed as one Soul-Devouring Spear shattered under Luo Tian’s full-force strike.

Chapter 1533: Self-Annihilation of the Soul

“You won’t die!” Luo Tian roared, watching Fu Xingxuan’s soul grow more ethereal. He raised his finger, unleashing a wild wave that swept over Fu Xingxuan’s soul.

“Soul-Sealing!” Luo Tian’s low voice echoed, Fu Xingxuan’s soul twisting and halting mid-flight toward the other Soul-Devouring Spear. Luo Tian’s suction force pulled it out forcefully.

“You won’t die!” Luo Tian kept speaking, his voice trembling with guilt. Fu Xingxuan, once the beloved princess of the Star-Moon Divine Clan, now faced annihilation because of him. How could Luo Tian not feel remorse?

Though Luo Tian had pulled Fu Xingxuan’s soul out, it still drifted faintly, plunging Luo Tian into despair.

“Seal! Seal! Seal!” Luo Tian’s hands moved continuously, emitting waves of gray soul energy from his body toward Fu Xingxuan’s fading soul.

“He’s using his own soul to help Fu Xingxuan recover!” Tu Feiyang and Xue Shengfei didn’t attack, their eyes filled with shock as they watched Luo Tian.

Soul energy is a person’s essence; if it perishes, the individual ceases to exist. Luo Tian’s actions would harm his own foundation.

But at this moment, Luo Tian couldn’t care less. If Fu Xingxuan died, what could he return?

Luo Tian knew Fu Xingxuan could have stayed with Jin Yangxi, but if he were struck by Tu Feiyang’s group, his physical body might not die, but would certainly be severely wounded. Facing them again, he’d still perish. Fu Xingxuan had risked her life to give him a chance, and Luo Tian understood.

“Don’t waste your soul energy! Don’t let my death be in vain. Escape, find your other wife and reunite your family!” Fu Xingxuan’s illusory soul smiled, speaking softly to Luo Tian.

“I know. I’m not good, I’m capricious and stubborn, but I love you—irresistibly. I always want to test you, making you aware of my presence!”

“I truly hope you remain the Grand Commander of the Star-Moon Guard. That was my happiest time, though you never belonged to me!” Fu Xingxuan spoke as if unaware of her fate, continuously pouring out words she might never say again.

“It’s my fault. When I said you wouldn’t die, you won’t! No one can take your life—not even Heaven itself!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice resolute.

“It was my mistake. When you recover, I’ll be your Grand Commander again!” Luo Tian then shouted aloud, his hands moving swiftly. A gray soul blade materialized above his head and slashed downward.

“Ah…” Intense pain made Luo Tian roar, as the gray soul blade pierced his body and struck his soul. Half of his soul transformed into a surge of gray mist, bursting toward Fu Xingxuan.

“Truly ruthless! He self-annihilated his soul!” Xue Shengfei’s face was stunned, watching the soul energy erupting from Luo Tian.

“What a soul! It’s so powerful. I feel my entire soul isn’t as strong as what he severed. How many did he cut? If only a single thread, how terrifying his soul must be!” Tu Feiyang’s group also looked shocked for the first time.

“Hum…” The humming echoed as the surging soul energy instantly rushed into Fu Xingxuan’s soul, gradually solidifying it.

“Xiao Qian, take this sister to your grandfather!” Seeing Fu Xingxuan’s soul solidify, Luo Tian addressed Xiao Qian standing there.

“Hmph!” Xiao Qian had no desire to stay, finding Tu Feiyang’s group too terrifying. He took a step forward, reaching for Fu Xingxuan’s soul and guiding it into the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

“Where do you think you’re going!” Seeing Xiao Qian grasp the soul, Tu Feiyang’s group showed surprise. However, they were more concerned about Xiao Qian—the immortal herb that had formed a human shape. If it entered the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda, catching it would be nearly impossible.

“Hum…” Xue Shengfei moved his hands, the remaining Soul-Devouring Spear erupting with a torrent of blood energy toward Xiao Qian.

“Ah… run!” As the crimson spear erupted, Xiao Qian’s body trembled but his speed surged. His leg pushed off, becoming a blur that vanished from their sight, instantly entering the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

“Now it’s my turn to play with you! As the heir of the Ancient King, I’ll end you today—no matter your curse!” Luo Tian’s face was pale, the self-annihilation of half his soul having severely wounded him. Yet he no longer cared. He reached out, grabbing the spear that had flown toward Xiao Qian.

“Crinkle…” A grating sound echoed as the crimson spear shattered in Luo Tian’s grasp, bursting into waves of blood mist that spread outward.

“Now you’re in this state—still want to fight us three?” Seeing Luo Tian’s pale face, Tu Feiyang’s group sneered.

“Did you forget when I stepped on you?” Luo Tian moved swiftly, his soul wounded but his body and cultivation fully recovered. The only limitation was his Soul-Subduing Master techniques.

“Die!” Seeing Luo Tian charge toward them, Tu Feiyang and Yu Fantian’s faces darkened. They moved in three directions, attacking Luo Tian.

“Crack…” Luo Tian’s figure instantly appeared before Tu Feiyang, launching a powerful punch that collided with him. The full-force punch sent Tu Feiyang flying, his face pale.

At the moment Luo Tian and Tu Feiyang collided, Yu Fantian and Xue Shengfei’s attacks also arrived, striking Luo Tian.

“Go!” Luo Tian roared, turning sharply. A white inscription wrapped his fist, striking Yu Fantian fiercely while enduring Xue Shengfei’s attack with his body.

“Boom… Boom…” Two more resounding impacts echoed, golden feathers swirling in the starry sky. Yu Fantian’s body retreated.

But Luo Tian’s back was struck by Xue Shengfei’s crimson fist, collapsing it.

“Though you’re strong, one against three is still insufficient!” Xue Shengfei clenched his fists, feeling a slight numbness. His eyes held concern; Luo Tian’s body was beyond his expectations.

Luo Tian panted heavily, fighting three opponents was a massive pressure. Yet he refused to leave in disgrace; at least he’d kill one of them to ease his resentment.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian’s body rose again, his first step of the Seven Steps of the Barbarian God crashing down toward Yu Fantian.

A golden foot shattered the stars, directly crushing Yu Fantian, who immediately changed his expression.

“Yu Emperor’s Blade!” Yu Fantian roared, moving his hands to send a silver blade slicing toward the golden foot.

“Blood Demon’s Claws!”

“Eight Directions of Blood Ocean, Swallowing the Heavens!” At the same time, Xue Shengfei and Tu Feiyang conjured powerful attacks toward Luo Tian.

A crimson demon’s claw hovered above Xue Shengfei, tearing through the stars toward Luo Tian.

An endless sea of blood filled the stars, slowing Luo Tian’s movements. A nine-heaven blood dragon coiled around him, roaring toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The golden foot collided with the silver blade, a thunderous explosion echoing in the starry sky.

On the other side, the crimson claws seemed slow but instantly appeared above Luo Tian’s head, cracks of space forming around them as they grabbed toward him.

“Intercepting Seal!” A golden vortex spun rapidly in the starry sky, a golden seal crashing down to collide with the crimson claws. A violent explosion echoed again in the starry sky.

“Roar…” Though Luo Tian blocked two attacks, Tu Feiyang’s nine blood dragons struck his body.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Each explosion shattered on Luo Tian’s body, spilling blood from his mouth. His body was pushed back repeatedly.

“You seem to have forgotten me!” A low voice echoed, heat radiating in the starry sky. Golden fire crows emerged from Jin Yangxi’s hands, swirling toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face slightly changed; he had forgotten Jin Yangxi. With Fu Xingxuan injured, Jin Yangxi no longer had an opponent and naturally joined the attack on Luo Tian.

As for Sun Mengru, Jin Yangxi paid little attention. Their focus was on Luo Tian; once he died, Sun Mengru would also fall. Moreover, Sun Mengru’s condition was slightly better than Luo Tian’s, but the soul and Hun Badan had completely suppressed her. Capturing Sun Mengru was just a matter of time.

Chapter 1534: Slaying the Ancient King’s Heir

Golden fire crows swirled in the starry sky, surrounding Luo Tian and attacking him instantly.

The explosions echoed as the nine blood dragons’ damage hadn’t fully healed, and the golden fire crows exploded before Luo Tian, covering him in blood.

“Not good; if this continues, I might be worn down!” Luo Tian’s body was in chaos. He thought about Sun Mengru, who was slightly better than him but still weak.

“Kill!” As Luo Tian pondered, the four attacked again with overwhelming power, making Luo Tian’s face grim. His hands moved swiftly.

“Boom…” The reincarnation of the immortal body in Luo Tian’s dantian shattered, terrifying epoch power surging around him. As his hands moved, waves of devastating killing energy erupted from them, causing the four’s faces to shift.

“What is he evolving?” They were stunned by Luo Tian’s killing energy, realizing they couldn’t let him succeed. If he did, they wouldn’t survive either.

“Blood Ocean Devours Heaven!” Xue Shengfei halted, his hands moving swiftly. A torrent of blood surged from his body, forming a massive mouth with crimson fangs that made people shiver. The cold fangs were the Soul-Devouring Spear that had nearly annihilated Sun Mengru. Faced with Luo Tian’s immense pressure, Xue Shengfei finally used his ultimate technique.

The other three also attacked, waves of overwhelming power erupting from their hands, each carrying apocalyptic might.

Jin Yangxi transformed into his true form—a three-headed golden raven, spewing divine laws that formed a tangible three-headed golden raven, bathed in golden divine fire, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“World-Ending Staff!” Golden feathers swirled in the starry sky, coalescing into a golden staff. A phantom figure wielded it, radiating holy energy as it rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” Four overwhelming martial arts collided with Luo Tian, bending his body but he continued evolving. A golden aura surged above his head, forming a golden palace that gradually solidified into reality before their eyes.

“This was the technique of an ancient human sage!” Recognizing the illusory palace, they recalled Gu Tian’s legendary might.

The golden ancient palace solidified as Luo Tian evolved it, and his bent body gradually straightened. Within two breaths, the four’s apocalyptic martial arts struck Luo Tian, and at the same time, the golden ancient palace fully materialized under Luo Tian’s control.

The power was earth-shattering, colliding with the four’s martial arts and causing a thunderous explosion that echoed in the starry sky. The power swept Luo Tian far away.

Though Luo Tian’s technique was extraordinary, Yu Fantian and Xue Shengfei’s techniques were equally formidable—ancient king-level skills. Their collision shattered the entire starry sky.

A world-ending storm swept through the stars, and Xue Shengfei’s group formed a four-color barrier to block the terrifying storm. Their faces were shocked, watching Luo Tian and the ancient palace engulfed in explosions.

“Such terrifying power—he should survive, but will be severely wounded!” Yu Fantian’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction as the storm showed no signs of stopping.

“Dharma Body! Heaven and Earth!” But before Yu Fantian’s words finished, a low voice echoed from the storm. A massive figure shattered through the storm, appearing before them.

“Boom…” At the same time, the golden ancient palace trembled and soared from the gray storm, instantly descending upon the four. The immense pressure made their faces shift violently.

Luo Tian was covered in blood, his face pale. His towering body bore numerous jagged scars, with golden bones visible through the wounds, appearing grotesque.

“Impossible!” Xue Shengfei’s group was stunned; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so powerful, surviving such a devastating attack with only injuries.

The golden ancient palace descended slowly, its immense pressure causing the barrier before Xue Shengfei’s group to crack instantly.

“I, too, can subdue the royal clan’s prince with one hand!” Luo Tian roared to the heavens, then took a step forward. His massive body appeared above the ancient palace.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” His golden foot stepped down, crushing the ancient palace radiating supreme power.

“Crack…” As Luo Tian took his step, the barrier formed by the four shattered instantly, scattering into divine laws before them.

“Damn it!” Their faces turned grim as they gazed at the ancient palace hovering above them.

They wanted to flee but felt an immense pressure as if a mountain had been placed on their backs.

“Ferocious God’s Second Step, Shattering the Stars!” As they were stunned, Luo Tian took his second step. The power was overwhelming, crushing the ancient palace again by three inches.

“Crack…” Two steps down, their bodies emitted crackling sounds. Their eyes showed terror as their bodies groaned under the supreme pressure.

“Fighting back!” They exchanged glances, realizing if they continued being suppressed, they might be crushed to death.

“Split up and escape! If we don’t gather together, we can separate and exhaust him to death!” Jin Yangxi shouted, spitting out a golden flame inscription into his body. His aura rose gradually as he flapped his golden wings, fleeing toward the distance.

“Go!” Jin Yangxi roared, as if burning all his strength, rushing forward.

“Body Transference!” Xue Shengfei’s face was pale; he moved his hands, sending invisible waves over himself and Tu Feiyang. Their bodies twisted within the ancient palace, eventually vanishing beneath it.

“Damn it!” Yu Fantian roared to the heavens, his body radiating divine light. He flew out of the ancient palace’s range.

Luo Tian’s face was cold, but he sighed deeply inside. Though he had subdued four opponents alone, his condition was at its worst.

This was the first time Luo Tian had used Yu Fantian’s attack to evolve an epoch treasure. Plus, he had self-annihilated his soul and clashed with their combined strength. He knew he could barely endure another step.

“Ferocious God’s Third Step, Scaring Gods and Spirits!” Seeing Tu Feiyang flee, Luo Tian didn’t chase him but took his third step.

“Boom…” His golden foot crushed the ancient palace, which descended with overwhelming power toward Yu Fantian, who was about to escape.

“Ah…” Yu Fantian roared as the ancient palace descended, halting his movement. Without the four’s combined resistance, he couldn’t withstand its supreme pressure.

“Boom…” The golden palace smashed onto Yu Fantian’s body, and at the same time, the golden ancient palace could no longer endure, shattering.

The thunderous explosion echoed as golden blood mist rose. Yu Fantian was reduced to a blood mist in the stunned eyes of Tu Feiyang and others. Luo Tian’s massive body also collapsed, returning to normal size.

“Crackling…” Seven-colored flames erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, instantly forming a vast firestorm that burned through the stars. It annihilated Yu Fantian’s blood completely.

“Soul-Subduing!” Luo Tian pointed his finger, and Yu Fantian’s soul, fleeing within the seven-colored flames, suddenly halted. His gray eyes were filled with terror.

“Die!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, and as his words fell, Yu Fantian’s soul exploded in the fiery flames, consumed by the terrifying fire.

“Yu Fantian is dead!” Tu Feiyang’s group stared at Yu Fantian being annihilated by Luo Tian, their faces filled with fear.

“Ah…” As Yu Fantian died, a gray flame also rose within Luo Tian’s body. It was thick and coiled around his soul.

Cold sweat flowed down Luo Tian’s forehead as Yu Fantian died, unleashing a massive curse.

“Contain it!” Luo Tian’s body radiated white light, his powerful blood energy surging to counter the gray flame.

“Mengru, go!” Luo Tian addressed Sun Mengru still clashing with Hun Badan and the soul. He knew they had to leave; if not, they might never escape.

“Where are you going!” Hun Badan’s face was grotesque, his gray sword slicing toward Sun Mengru.

“I’m not only leaving—I’ll kill you!” Sun Mengru spoke coldly, her hands moving. The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda, suspended in the starry sky, emitted a thunderous roar. It radiated overwhelming power above Sun Mengru’s head.

Chapter 1535: Departure

The gray Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda radiated supreme power, hovering above Sun Mengru’s head. It cast waves of gray light into her body, and the gray energy surged in, healing her battered form.

“Go!” Sun Mengru pointed her finger; the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda vanished from above her head, collapsing through the heavens toward Hun Badan.

“Boom…” The thunderous roar echoed as the epoch treasure forged by the legendary master of breaking heaven was used again. It crushed countless ancient clan masters, and now it descended upon the heir of the Ancient King. Hun Badan and the soul’s faces turned grim.

“Block it!” Hun Badan and the soul shouted desperately, their bodies radiating immense power.

“Bazhai’s First Slash!” Hun Badan’s gray sword moved, a streak of darkness appearing before him. It slashed toward the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

“Ferocious God’s Seven Steps, Shattering the Eons!” The soul’s face was also wild. His massive foot with intricate patterns crashed toward the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous roar echoed in the starry sky. In an instant, the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda collided with their martial arts.

Though their techniques were extraordinary, even Luo Tian would find them challenging. However, against the epoch treasure driven by Sun Mengru’s full power, they were still insufficient. Their techniques barely lasted a moment before being shattered and crushing toward them.

Though their martial arts were destroyed, they still affected the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda’s power. The impact struck their bodies, causing them to crack as if a slight touch would shatter them. Blood spewed from their mouths like money.

Their bodies were top-tier, so they could withstand the reduced Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda. If it were a regular epoch peak, they would have been annihilated in one strike.

“Tricky!” Luo Tian observed the battlefield, noting that Jin Yangxi’s group wasn’t faring better. The epoch late-stage Jin Yangxi and Fan Jingyu were negligible. Only Hun Badan and the soul remained. If they were severely wounded, Luo Tian and Sun Mengru would surely escape safely.

“What else do you have? Use it!” Hun Badan roared, his body flying out of the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda’s suppression toward Sun Mengru.

“Still has fighting strength!”

Luo Tian panted heavily, watching Hun Badan’s body with cracks rushing toward Sun Mengru. He moved swiftly to her side, fearing she might be in danger.

“I said you’d die—now you do! Next life, keep your mouth clean. No, you won’t have a next life!” Sun Mengru spoke softly, then looked at Hun Badan with mockery.

“Soul-Eating!” A cold voice echoed from Sun Mengru, causing Luo Tian’s eyes to narrow.

As soon as Sun Mengru spoke, Hun Badan’s body halted abruptly, his face filled with terror. He pointed at Sun Mengru.

“What happened?” Jin Yangxi and others, recovering in the starry sky, looked puzzled at Hun Badan standing still. They didn’t know what had happened.

“Ah…” Hun Badan suddenly screamed in pain, his hands clutching his head as he bent over. His blood energy surged.

But Hun Badan only let out a cry before stopping, still in the position of hands clutching his head and bending over. He fell toward the starry sky.

“Hun Badan’s soul was destroyed!” Jin Yangxi and others’ faces were stunned, watching Hun Badan fall. They could clearly feel his soul had vanished, leaving only a corpse.

“How did she do it?” The onlookers were shocked, unable to see how Hun Badan’s soul was destroyed. It had been too fast.

“This corpse can’t be wasted!” Luo Tian’s face was filled with admiration, gazing at Hun Badan’s corpse falling into the stars. His eyes also held disbelief.

Luo Tian had been startled by Sun Mengru’s technique at first, but then he recalled her words: “Soul-Eating.”

He had initially thought she used a martial technique, but after seeing Hun Badan’s soul vanish rapidly, he realized her method.

Such a fast technique to annihilate a soul could only be done by a Soul-Subduing Master. Yet even a Soul-Subduing Master couldn’t destroy another’s soul without knowing when they still had a body.

“Unexpectedly, the Soul-Eater Worm is so变态!” Luo Tian muttered, grabbing Hun Badan’s corpse.

A streak of black light flashed as tiny figures emerged from Hun Badan’s body—Soul-Eater Worms, appearing before everyone.

“What is that?” Everyone looked puzzled at the tiny creatures. Without careful observation, they wouldn’t notice them. Their vision was beyond ordinary people, allowing them to see the small creature.

“It’s a Soul-Eater Worm!” They soon recognized it, their faces filled with disbelief.

“How could such a thing exist? And it can devour an epoch peak soul! This Soul-Eater Worm must have completed its third transformation!” Jin Yangxi’s face was stunned, speaking in disbelief.

“Wasn’t it said to be extinct? And completing the third transformation is impossible, right?” Xue Shengfei’s group also looked shocked.

Soul-Eater Worms were rare even in the ancient times. In that great era, their name was legendary because an ancient king had raised one and achieved human form. Though not as strong as a king, it was beyond the reach of most princes.

“Time to go!” As they were stunned, Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly. He gazed into the depths of the Mortal Domain, sensing a massive wave like a primordial beast approaching. That aura belonged to an epoch prince.

“Go!” Luo Tian and Sun Mengru exchanged a glance. Sun Mengru waved her hand, the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda appearing above their heads. It radiated waves of light, enveloping them and flying toward the Mortal Domain’s entrance.

“Damn it! We can’t let them escape!” Jin Yangxi’s group watched Luo Tian and Sun Mengru flying toward the Mortal Domain’s entrance, their faces filled with madness.

Four ancient kings’ heirs and two epoch peak geniuses had failed to kill them, but they were killed instead. If this spread, they’d be buried by the mockery of all ancient clans.

“Should’ve brought a king’s weapon!” They regretted deeply now. If they had one, Luo Tian and Sun Mengru would have no chance to turn back.

But now they knew it was too late. Their bodies had just recovered slightly, and their hands radiated waves of light again, gathering terrifying power to deliver a final strike to Luo Tian and Sun Mengru.

A torrent of epoch energy erupted from their hands, even Jin Ziyang and Fan Jingyu, who had just broken free of their seals, joined in.

“Boom…” The four combined forces unleashed a massive wave that surged through the stars, crushing Luo Tian and Sun Mengru.

“Block it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened; he knew this was their final strike. If they survived, they could escape the Mortal Domain and enter the human realm. If not, they’d die.

The massive wave surged forward, colliding with Luo Tian and Sun Mengru. The terrifying power made Luo Tian’s face change violently, standing in front of Sun Mengru.

“Eight Directions of Treasure Falling!” Luo Tian knew they couldn’t withstand it with their current state. The only reliance was the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

Invisible waves erupted from his hands, instantly entering the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda. It emitted a powerful hum, and waves of gray inscriptions burst from it, attaching to the gray barrier.

At the same time, the four’s combined attack collided with the barrier. The thunderous sound made both Luo Tian and Sun Mengru spit blood from their orifices.

“Crack…” Even with the “Eight Directions of Treasure Falling” technique, the gray barrier still shattered under the terrifying impact.

Luo Tian grabbed Sun Mengru and held her in his arms, using his back to withstand the remaining impact.

“Pf…” Next moment, Luo Tian spat out divine blood; his entire back was wiped away by the impact, revealing golden bones.

“Go…” Luo Tian’s eyes showed weakness; his eyelids felt heavy. This was the first time he had felt such exhaustion. After this battle, Luo Tian had suffered severe injuries—curse power and self-annihilation of his soul. Any normal person would have been devastated by these wounds.

“Hmph!” Blood spattered on Sun Mengru’s face. She extended her hands, lifting Luo Tian and rushing through the terrifying wave. They finally escaped the Mortal Domain’s entrance, vanishing from Jin Yangxi and Xue Shengfei’s sight.
