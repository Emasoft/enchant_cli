“Long You Ran was renowned across several cities, her strength barely a step away from the Heavenly Dao Realm. Zhu Fenghuo had expended considerable effort to capture her, and we cannot fight her—she is still causing chaos there!” Zhao Er Niu, having endured the pain, was now genuinely unafraid. He recounted the entire incident to Luo Tian with meticulous clarity.

“Truly a nuisance!” Luo Tian lightly pressed his forehead. Long You Ran was no great threat, but he knew Long Li was no easy opponent. To hold a city’s dominion meant she was formidable.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian sighed, eager to send this troublemaker away. He had no desire to entangle himself with the city lords in the vicinity.

Zhao Er Niu led Luo Tian and Zhao Da Hu toward the room where Long You Ran was detained.

“This is it!” Zhao Er Niu guided Luo Tian to the former residence of Zhu Fenghuo—a vast courtyard.

“Boom…” Upon arriving at the courtyard’s entrance, a thunderous roar echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. A green dragon soared skyward.

“Hmph, what a woman! She should have left already. Why is she still causing trouble?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, having saved her.

“Daring to strike me—do you wish to die?” A cold voice rang out, sharp yet laced with fury.

In the wake of her shout, the courtyard’s gate exploded. The scene within and its culprit appeared before Luo Tian.

The courtyard lay in disarray, a woman clad in emerald robes, her long hair flowing. A sash tied at the waist accentuated her perfect figure. Her exquisite features and flawless form left Luo Tian momentarily awestruck, undeterred by the chaos.

“Truly remarkable,” Luo Tian mused, gazing at her formidable presence.

Though impressed, Luo Tian harbored no improper thoughts. His wives remained missing, and he was far older than this girl.

“Stop!” Luo Tian coldly intoned, stepping into the courtyard. His gaze met Long You Ran’s as she turned to assess him.

“You are their new leader?” A clear voice echoed. Long You Ran’s face bore an icy demeanor before she conjured a green dragon from her hands, which surged toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 1764: I Am Not Leaving Yet

The green dragon soared toward Luo Tian, its overwhelming aura causing Zhao Da Hu and Zhao Er Niu to tremble.

“Boom…” Luo Tian waved his sleeve, releasing an invisible wave that shattered the dragon into swirling winds.

“Kill…” Seeing her attack dismantled, Long You Ran’s expression darkened. She lunged toward Luo Tian.

“Return!” Luo Tian frowned, grasping her fist mid-strike.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed. Luo Tian stood firm, while Long You Ran halted abruptly, their robes fluttering in the gusts.

“Hmph…” Long You Ran sneered, lifting her leg to kick Luo Tian’s most vulnerable spot.

“Little firecracker!” Luo Tian refused to let her succeed, snatching her leg with his other hand.

“Girl, I saved you. Why attack me?” Luo Tian coldly inquired.

Long You Ran paused, locking eyes with Luo Tian. She felt as though she’d fallen into an abyss.

“No one has ever looked at me like that,” Long You Ran, naively inexperienced, could not withstand Luo Tian’s gaze.

“Have you had enough?” Luo Tian asked as Long You Ran calmed. His eyes held their usual smile.

Hearing his words, Long You Ran blushed. She hadn’t noticed until now—their position was awkward.

“Could you let me go first?” Long You Ran addressed Luo Tian, her hands and feet trapped by his grip. His hold had even sealed her cultivation.

“Then promise not to cause trouble!” Luo Tian observed her subdued demeanor. He had no patience for this girl.

“Hmm.” Long You Ran nodded. She knew she was outmatched by Luo Tian, even surpassing her father’s Heavenly Dao Realm. Her father, Long Li, could not have subdued her so easily.

“Good.” Luo Tian nodded, releasing Long You Ran. After all, she was a thorny issue tied to Long Li.

“Alright, go. Don’t bother me.” Luo Tian watched her adjust her robes before speaking.

“Hey… what’s your name?” As Luo Tian turned, Long You Ran’s clear voice echoed.

“Luo Tian.” Luo Tian replied softly without turning. He saw no urgency in their paths.

“You said I should leave, but I’m not leaving yet!” However, Long You Ran’s words made Luo Tian pause.

“After finally escaping, how could I return so easily? The exam is still far off. Once I enter the Heavenly Dragon Gate, there’ll be no chance to play again!” Long You Ran mused. Luo Tian had now piqued her curiosity.

A peer in age, yet his strength surpassed even her father’s. He had the audacity to kill Zhu Fenghuo. Long You Ran knew Zhu Fenghuo’s backers; if not for his connections, the neighboring cities might have already united to destroy Zhu Fenghuo.

“Long Miss, what do you mean? I saved you. Are you repaying me with mischief?” Luo Tian’s face bore annoyance.

“Exactly! Since you’re my savior, I must repay you!” Long You Ran chuckled, leaving Zhao Da Hu and Zhao Er Niu speechless.

“…” Luo Tian felt at a loss. This Long You Ran was like an unyielding band-aid—he had released her, yet she lingered.

“Headache…” Luo Tian felt he had no solution for this girl.

“Fine, do as you wish. But don’t cause trouble!” Luo Tian decided to let her be for now.

“Of course, of course!” Long You Ran smiled triumphantly before addressing Zhao Er Niu.

“You, find someone to clean this courtyard. I’ll stay here from now on!” Long You Ran swiftly took charge, hands on her hips.

“Eh… this…” Zhao Er Niu stammered, unsure how to respond.

“Obey her,” Luo Tian sighed, patting his head before leading Zhao Da Hu out to find a quiet courtyard.

After Long You Ran’s commotion, dusk approached. Luo Tian instructed Zhao Da Hu on matters before sitting cross-legged on his bed.

“I wonder how the others are doing,” Luo Tian sighed, still concerned for his loved ones and friends.

“First priority is to enhance my strength. I must deal with Zhu Fenghuo’s formidable brother before anything else!”

“Additionally, I need to study alchemy. To enter the Heavenly Immortal Realm in such a short time, only elixirs can achieve it!” Luo Tian mused, opening the jade slip he had taken from the treasure vault.

…

Time flowed steadily. Three days passed, and the Flame Fire Sect was fully under Luo Tian’s control. In these three days, people across several cities rejoiced—this notorious Flame Fire Sect had mysteriously vanished.

As three days passed, the name change to Celestial Yuan Sect spread gradually. Luo Tian’s act of killing Zhu Fenghuo, the formidable leader of Flame Fire Sect, was known to all major cities.

“Who is this Luo Tian? How dare he attack Zhu Fenghuo?” In the city hall of Dragon Roar City, a stern middle-aged man sat, his face puzzled.

“Unknown. He seemed to appear out of nowhere, killing straight into Flame Fire Sect. Zhu Fenghuo and his loyalists were all annihilated!” An elder spoke, his voice laced with admiration.

“Let’s observe. Daring to attack Zhu Fenghuo and not fleeing—there must be talent. After all, he surely knows Zhu Fenghuo is backed by the Heavenly Dragon Gate’s disciples.”

“By the way, has Long You Ran returned any messages? She’s been gone for two days. When she was at home, she caused chaos; now that she’s left, I miss this annoying girl!” Long Li smiled.

“Her talent and strength should easily qualify for the Heavenly Dragon Gate. Then, our Dragon Roar City will be connected to it!” The elder smiled warmly at Long Li.

“Indeed. Then no one in our Dragon Roar City will dare to provoke us!”

“But I worry she might encounter danger on the way. Though Zhu Fenghuo was ordered to let her go, it takes three months to reach Flame Fire Sect. This girl is too playful; the people I sent couldn’t control her. I fear she might delay matters!” Long Li spoke again, his voice laced with helplessness.

“I’ll go myself. I should catch up with her. She still listens to me!” The elder smiled.

“Then thank you, Elder Zheng. When passing by Celestial Yuan Sect, check on Luo Tian’s background!” Long Li spoke softly.

Other city lords remained inactive, avoiding contact with this Celestial Yuan Sect. They wanted to observe the sect’s leader’s abilities against Zhu Fenghuo’s brother, the Heavenly Dragon Gate disciples.

…

At Celestial Yuan Sect, Luo Tian sat at the head, smiling as he gazed at his subordinates.

“Alright, rules are set. We still need to do business; after all, we must eat and cultivate!”

“But remember one thing: no harm to heaven or people. Like Da Hu before, we only rob the wicked! If anyone is found out, you know the consequences!” Luo Tian smiled, but his subordinates shivered. The recent event of Luo Tian annihilating Zhu Fenghuo had left them in awe.

“Yes…” Before anyone could speak, a clear voice echoed. Long You Ran stood up, her eyes alight with excitement.

“Don’t cause trouble, go play!” Luo Tian sighed at Long You Ran’s antics. These three days had truly made him surrender to her.

Long You Ran had fully integrated into the bandit life, even hinting at being the sect’s second-in-command.

“Leader, do you know who I am? In these cities, which tyrant don’t I know? Rest assured, no one escapes my eyes!” Long You Ran puffed out her chest, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Indeed!” Hearing her words, Luo Tian nodded. Her logic was sound.

“Alright, brothers and sisters, let’s go do business!” Seeing Luo Tian agree, Long You Ran’s eyes sparkled with excitement as she addressed the crowd.

“Sure thing, Second Leader!” The hall echoed with responses, their eyes filled with respect.

“She truly has talent. In three days, she’s already gained authority!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, watching them leave. He returned to his courtyard.

“Development requires more than just robbing!” Luo Tian shook his head, raising his hand. The Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel emerged with a thunderous roar before him.

“Enough these days!” Luo Tian smiled, then waved his hand. A cluster of life-infused herbs flew from his palm.

Chapter 1765: Zheng Tiande

“Third Turn Convergence Elixir!” Luo Tian murmured, seven-colored flames erupting from his palm and surging into the Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel’s mouth.

“Roar…” A dragon’s roar echoed from the vessel, a seven-colored fire dragon churning within.

“Broken Star Grass… Frost Grass…” A series of herbs flew from Luo Tian’s palm—ingredients for the Third Turn Convergence Elixir.

These herbs were previously collected by Zhu Fenghuo, intended for Ye Hongyi of Shoulong City to refine the Third Turn Convergence Elixir. Now, they benefited Luo Tian, saving him considerable time.

Ye Hongyi was the only Second-Grade Alchemist in surrounding cities. Shoulong City treated him like a god, even Zhu Fenghuo, who was usually defiant, respected Ye Hongyi. This highlighted the rarity of alchemists in the immortal realm and why Shoulong City was prominent among surrounding cities.

Time passed, and Luo Tian placed over a hundred herbs into the Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel. His movements were flawless, having done this countless times.

“Buzz…” The seven-colored flames began to refine the herbs with immense power.

“This is a massive consumption!” Luo Tian sighed, his forehead drenched in sweat. Though Xiao Qi refined quickly, the mental energy consumed was extraordinary—several times more than in Nine Realms. This disoriented Luo Tian slightly.

Time flowed steadily. After an hour, Luo Tian completed refining over a hundred herbs, his forehead glistening with sweat.

“Next is the hardest!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he gazed at the blue sky.

“Summoning Immortal Qi!” Luo Tian murmured, activating his Reincarnation Heaven Art. The Reincarnation Channel emitted a buzzing sound, drawing in force.

The world trembled. A wave of energy surged above Luo Tian’s courtyard, invisible waves drawn by his Reincarnation Heaven Art. They rushed toward the Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel.

The buzzing echoed as Luo Tian continuously channeled energy. A single immortal qi finally coalesced, earning a smile from Luo Tian.

“Good start!” Luo Tian murmured before focusing on refining the immortal qi into the elixir.

Time flowed steadily. An hour passed, and three powerful waves of immortal qi were finally refined within the emerald elixir. They swirled like three dragons, entwined.

However, Luo Tian’s joy was short-lived. His face turned grim.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed. Observing with his spiritual sense, the three immortal qi initially drifted but then collided violently.

The elixir could not withstand this. It boiled within the Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel, as if ignited.

“Explosion!” Luo Tian hesitated not. This scene was too familiar; he quickly withdrew his flames, dodging to the side.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian fled, a thunderous sound echoed behind him. A terrifying power swept over his back.

The Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel’s lid flew open, a surge of power and blinding light erupting skyward, as if opening a passage to the heavens.

“Earthquake!” The explosion shook the mountain stronghold. Those inside rushed out, witnessing the towering light column.

“What is this? Is it the sect leader’s technique?” Bandits gaped in awe at Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian, battered and bruised, lay on the ground. His back was bare, blood trickling from his wounds.

“This damned thing—immortal realm explosion is so severe!” Luo Tian stood up, feeling his internal organs shifted.

Yet he quickly changed clothes, standing tall with a solemn expression.

“Leader, what happened?” Zhao Da Hu and other bandits arrived at Luo Tian’s courtyard. Upon seeing the massive vessel, they knew it was no ordinary item.

“Master is refining elixirs. A momentary mistake!” Luo Tian nodded, addressing Zhao Da Hu.

“Refining elixirs? Master is an alchemist?” Zhao Da Hu and others gaped, looking at Luo Tian. In their view, a youth of his age reaching the Heavenly Dao Realm could not be an alchemist. They knew well the prestige of alchemists in the immortal realm.

Yet they recalled the explosion, nodding. They understood that failed elixir refinement would cause an explosion.

“Probably just playing around!” They speculated, thinking Luo Tian was bored and took up alchemy on a whim.

“No problem. Everyone disperse!” Luo Tian addressed them, his demeanor calm.

“Yes!” Zhao Da Hu and others bowed to Luo Tian before returning to their tasks, leaving him alone in the courtyard.

“Ugh…” As they left, Luo Tian gasped, hopping around recklessly.

“You damned thing—I won’t let you beat me!” After recovering, his back wounds healed gradually. He gritted his teeth, determination in his eyes.

Luo Tian was unaware that this problem was trivial for other immortal realm alchemists. He simply lacked guidance, needing to figure it out himself.

“Boom… boom… boom…” In the following days, Luo Tian’s courtyard often echoed with explosions. The Celestial Yuan Sect members endured this pain but dared not disturb, hoping the master’s elixir fervor would subside.

During these days, those who went on raids also gained much. With Long You Ran leading them, any corrupt lord in surrounding cities who crossed their path never escaped.

“Go!” A clear voice echoed as Long You Ran kicked a greasy fat man, her eyes alight with excitement. She waved her hand, collecting his belongings.

Yet Long You Ran had altered her appearance; Luo Tian’s Mirage Mask was lent to her. After all, her identity was sensitive—being recognized might cause trouble.

“This is a gift for Lord Sun Luoshan of Luo Shan City. You dare to steal it?” The greasy man addressed Long You Ran, his voice threatening.

“Threaten me? Come on! Let the寨… no, our Second Sect take his hair!” Long You Ran ordered her bandits.

“Yes…” Hearing this, a group of fierce bandits surrounded the man, their faces twisted in grim smiles.

“Sun Luoshan isn’t a good person!” Long You Ran scoffed, collecting the items. A pitiful scream echoed behind her.

With Celestial Yuan Sect’s actions, people in several cities trembled again. Especially merchants, who were cautious—no one knew Luo Tian’s background or how to contact him. Yet the name “Mother Demon” spread among cities, as Luo Tian had never appeared; it was always Long You Ran managing the bandits.

As these days of raids continued, people in several cities felt reassured. This new bandit group didn’t rob commoners but only the wealthy lords and rich merchants. Moreover, honest merchants passing through were never charged, ensuring safe passage.

This changed people’s perception of Celestial Yuan Sect. Curiosity arose about this so-called sect leader, Luo Tian.

Long You Ran smiled triumphantly, striding with purpose. Her group had gathered much loot; it was time to return.

“Second Leader, big trouble!” As Long You Ran and a few others set off, commotion echoed in her ears.

“Sixzi, what’s wrong? Don’t be so flustered. As long as it’s not the city lords, there’s nothing to fear!” Long You Ran addressed the panting youth.

“Zhao Er Niu, they robbed an old man. That old man was a tough nut. He subdued them and wants to meet our leader! I was about to report to the leader when I met you, Second Leader!” The youth named Sixzi spoke.

“What? Daring to harm my people! I’ll see who’s foolish enough!” Long You Ran, hearing Sixzi’s words, grew furious.

“Second Leader, should we report to the leader?” Sixzi cautiously asked.

“No need. The leader is busy; it’s unnecessary. I’ll see who dares to harm my people!” Long You Ran smiled confidently. Among several cities, besides the city lords, she had no fear.

As they spoke, Long You Ran stormed toward Zhao Er Niu’s location. Before arriving, she shouted: “Who dared to harm Celestial Yuan Sect’s people!”

Yet her voice faded…

Chapter 1766: Elixir Forged

“Is this the so-called Mother Demon, Second Leader?” Before Long You Ran’s words ended, a weathered voice echoed.

“Cough… cough…” Hearing this voice, Long You Ran halted. Her gaze held fear.

Before her, Zhao Er Niu and others lay on the ground, bruised and groaning. Their cultivation was sealed.

An elder smiled, his gray robe revealing age but with sharp eyes that glinted. He surveyed Long You Ran.

“Why has this old man come?” Long You Ran, seeing the elder’s gaze, felt anxious. She steadied herself mentally.

“Elder, why did you injure my Celestial Yuan Sect members?” Long You Ran’s tone softened.

“Old man is Zheng Tiande, the steward of Dragon Roar City. I passed through here and heard that my city lord’s daughter, Long You Ran, was kidnapped by Zhu Fenghuo. Now Zhu Fenghuo is killed by Master Luo. I request Master Luo to return my city lord’s daughter, Long You Ran!” The elder’s face bore coldness as he gazed at Long You Ran.

Zheng Tiande was the elder sent by Long Li to track Long You Ran. Now, Zheng Tiande was desperate and furious. Zhu Fenghuo had broken the agreement with Long Li by kidnapping Long You Ran. If not for tracking her, they would have thought she had already gone to the Heavenly Dragon Gate.

Though Zheng Tiande was furious, he hadn’t lost his mind. As a steward of Dragon Roar City, he wasn’t ordinary. He hadn’t rashly attacked Celestial Yuan Sect but instead targeted Zhao Er Niu to force the mysterious sect leader to appear.

“If this old man knew I joined, my father would skin me!” Long You Ran mused, deciding not to let Zheng Tiande meet Luo Tian. After all, Luo Tian would be glad if she left.

“Elder, the one you mentioned—Long You Ran—we did save her. But after saving, we let her go. She must have already set off for the Heavenly Dragon Gate!” Long You Ran addressed Zheng Tiande. She didn’t want to return; these days she had played wildly, an experience she hadn’t known before.

The bandits around her felt a shiver. They knew the Mother Demon was this fierce old man’s Long You Ran. They couldn’t understand why she didn’t reveal her identity, yet they were merely puzzled. They had experienced Long You Ran’s strength and liked her; that was why she was called Second Leader.

“Hmm…” Hearing Long You Ran’s words, Zheng Tiande’s face darkened. He felt a vague familiarity with this Mother Demon but couldn’t recall where he had met her.

This Mother Demon’s strength also intimidated Zheng Tiande. With his current power, he couldn’t subdue her.

Zheng Tiande didn’t want to clash with this mysterious Celestial Yuan Sect. If Long You Ran was still here, harming this Mother Demon might endanger her.

“Then it’s a misunderstanding. I’ll report to my city lord. In a few days, we’ll visit to apologize!” Zheng Tiande pondered before deciding to inform Long Li and check if Long You Ran had already left.

“Rest easy. No problem, no problem. We won’t hold it against you!” Long You Ran waved her hand.

“Then I take my leave,” Zheng Tiande bowed to Long You Ran before turning toward Dragon Roar City.

“Phew…” Long You Ran sighed, relieved. She patted her chest, watching Zheng Tiande leave before addressing the crowd: “This matter must not be told to the leader. Got it?”

“Yes!” Zhao Er Niu and others replied, then rose, following Long You Ran toward the mountain stronghold.

“Boom…” A thunderous explosion echoed. A black shadow fell to the ground, emitting smoke.

“This is the hundredth time!” Zhao Da Hu and others remaining on the mountain looked exhausted, their eyes weary as they gazed at Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“I can’t take it anymore! I want to go out and do business. Here, I suffer; I prefer the hardships of the outside!” The bandits spoke, approaching Zhao Da Hu to volunteer for his group, leaving Zhao Da Hu in a dilemma.

“What’s going on?” At this moment, Long You Ran returned with her group. Compared to those inside the mountain stronghold, those returning from outside were more energetic.

“Second Leader, you’ve finally returned. Take me next time!” Seeing Long You Ran, they all felt like finding salvation, addressing her.

“Tell me what happened!” Long You Ran gazed at Luo Tian’s courtyard. She had also felt a tremor that made her uneasy.

“The leader has gone mad…” They spoke in unison, recounting the events of these days.

“Has he lost his mind? I risked my life outside, and he’s here refining elixirs! All the resources I brought these days must have been wasted!” Hearing their words, Long You Ran’s face changed. Her chest heaved violently.

As the daughter of Dragon Roar City’s lord, she knew alchemists were precious. Yet she also knew the resources they consumed were terrifying—far beyond what this small mountain stronghold could bear.

“I’ll check,” Long You Ran strode out, heading toward Luo Tian’s courtyard. The crowd sighed in relief; among Celestial Yuan Sect, only Long You Ran dared to face Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” As Long You Ran reached the courtyard’s entrance, waves rose in the sky. Black clouds enveloped the mountain stronghold, making Long You Ran’s face pale.

“Thunder Trial!” Long You Ran’s eyes widened in disbelief, her eyes wide as she gazed at the storm clouds and the smoky great vessel within Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Finally succeeded!” Luo Tian, his body charred black but eyes gleaming with intensity, had found the rules after days of research and trials.

At this moment, a green elixir hovered in the Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel. Three powerful immortal qi swirled within it, like three dragons entwined.

“Condense…” Luo Tian roared. The green elixir coalesced under his spiritual awareness, exploding into a single entity.

“Roar…” Smoke infused with life rose from the Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel, like dragons circling it.

“Elixir forged!” Long You Ran’s eyes glowed with awe, gazing at the seven-colored flames illuminating her dark face and the thick clouds above.

Time flowed steadily. The Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel thundered, and Luo Tian felt the exhilarating energy within it.

“Are you also happy? You’ve finally fulfilled Master Long Xiao’s wish!” Luo Tian smiled, then waved his hand. The vessel’s lid flew open.

“Buzz…” Immortal mist rose, radiance piercing the sky. It soared into the dark clouds.

“Come out!” Luo Tian smiled, guiding his spiritual awareness. The golden elixir slowly rose from the Celestial Flame Dragon Vessel, like a rising sun.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed. Golden lightning descended, forming a thick dragon that roared toward the golden elixir, as if to devour it.

The golden elixir radiated a brilliant light. A surge of life emerged from it, rushing toward the golden lightning.

Two dragons clashed in Luo Tian’s gaze, devouring each other.

“Those!” Celestial Yuan Sect members gaped in awe at the two powerful dragons devouring each other.

“You’re truly a genius. What’s your background?” Long You Ran’s eyes glowed with intensity, gazing at Luo Tian. Her curiosity deepened.

His strength was formidable; she could refine an elixir. Such talent was beyond many sects’ prodigies.

As people marveled, the two dragons collided and vanished, creating waves that swept outward.

“Buzz…” The dark clouds dispersed. Under Luo Tian’s smiling gaze, the golden elixir gently fell into his palm.

“If it were in Nine Realms, it wouldn’t have been so simple!” Luo Tian sighed, recalling Long Xiao’s elixir refining. That thunder trial was apocalyptic; this one paled in comparison to Long Xiao’s.

“I need to retreat. Leave the mountain stronghold to you!” Luo Tian addressed Long You Ran, who stood dazed. He then flew into his room without hesitation, placing the newly refined Third Turn Convergence Elixir into his mouth.

“Ugh… okay…” Long You Ran nodded numbly. What could she say? Her eyes glowed with intensity, sensing this bandit-formed Celestial Yuan Sect might rise.

Chapter 1767: City Lord Arrives

“Our leader is an alchemist!” The most discussed topic among Celestial Yuan Sect members these days was Luo Tian’s elixir refining. Alchemists were precious, so they benefited.

“Second Leader, we’re stable now. But tyrants are limited. If this continues, brothers will starve!” A middle-aged man spoke.

“Indeed. And tyrants’ outings are limited. Life will get worse!” People began to discuss.

“None of these matter. We have Master Luo, the great alchemist. Future will be good. Once our strength improves, we might truly become a sect. But it’s hard to start!” Long You Ran sat at the head, smiling as she addressed them.

Long You Ran knew alchemists’ power. A Second-Grade Alchemist could sustain a city’s people. Though she didn’t know Luo Tian’s grade, even a First-Grade Alchemist could sustain them.

“However, we must still rob. Everything waits for Master Luo to emerge!” Long You Ran calmed the crowd. She was just playing around; as for Celestial Yuan Sect, major matters still needed Luo Tian’s leadership.
