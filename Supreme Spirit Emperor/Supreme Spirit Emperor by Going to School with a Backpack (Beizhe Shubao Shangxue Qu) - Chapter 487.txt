“Unexpectedly, you’ve remained unchanged over these years. Even in such a state, you still managed to grow!” Li Piaoyun spoke calmly.

“Back then, I could defeat you. Now, I still can. But this time, I won’t grant you the chance to scheme against me!” Cen Weihong’s voice carried a chilling edge, as if the very world had turned frigid.

“Very well. Let us settle this now. I shall show no mercy, not even for brotherly ties!” Li Piaoyun declared.

“Brotherly ties? From the moment you betrayed me, poisoning my wine, I no longer recognized the word ‘brother’—only an enemy!” Cen Weihong’s voice brimmed with lethal intent.

“Unbelievable. Cen Weihong has truly ascended to such heights!” Sima Xiu mused, his gaze upon Cen Weihong laced with complex emotions.

“Crack!” A sharp, brittle sound echoed through all ears as a young man challenging the Earth Gate was crushed by a burly warrior, his body reduced to a mist of blood.

“Finished!” Two Earth Gate disciples grinned fiercely, their eyes locked on Cen Weihong and Li Piaoyun. Lo Tian’s victory was dismissed as trivial.

“Truly a prodigy! You three geniuses should rest for a moment,” Guan Hongsheng smiled, addressing them.

With the Earth Gate’s battle concluded, only the three sects’ prodigies remained. Joy and sorrow intertwined.

The Earth Gate and Iron Gate, unscathed, reveled in their triumph. Others, save for the Chaos Heaven Sect, bore grim faces, regretting their disciples’ fates. Even Li Changfeng felt a pang of sorrow—Zhao Ritian’s death, though weaker than those present, was a promising talent. His alchemy skills were commendable.

“Three sects are no pushovers! To provoke them is to invite annihilation!” Sect masters realized after the trials. They’d assumed their prodigies would face no danger, as the three sects sought to recruit them. But they miscalculated; the three sects tolerated no provocation.

“Then, it’s our turn to compete!” Li Changfeng smiled, addressing the group.

“Unbelievable. Cen Weihong has reached such heights!” Sima Xiu marveled, gazing at Cen Weihong clutching his black sword.

Once a name in the Earth Gate, Cen Weihong had shone during the sect’s grand competition. He’d reached the final, as did Li Piaoyun—victory would make one his disciple. Yet Cen Weihong had suddenly spat blood, defeated by Li Piaoyun. A senior reported he’d conspired with other sects; evidence was irrefutable. Thus, the Earth Gate had stripped him of his cultivation and cast him into the secular army.

Sima Xiu sensed something amiss but dismissed it; the Earth Gate valued victory over fairness. Now, Cen Weihong’s strength proved his worth—and Sima Xiu’s judgment flawed.

“Piaoyun, if the chance arises, kill Cen Weihong!” Sima Xiu mentally urged Li Piaoyun. Constantly haunted by Cen Weihong, no one could sleep easy.

“Same to you. You may kill whom you wish; I’ll cover for you. But don’t overextend—life is precious!” Li Changfeng mentally advised Cen Weihong and Lo Tian.

Meanwhile, two Earth Gate disciples nodded to Peng Tiande, their eyes flickering with malice toward Cen Weihong and Li Piaoyun.

“Enough. Begin. Decide your method!” Seeing Lo Tian’s refusal to rest, Guan Hongsheng addressed them.

“Piaoyun, your life!” As Guan’s words faded, Cen Weihong surged forward, charging at Li Piaoyun.

“Cen Weihong, are you so concerned for others?” Two burly youths approached Lo Tian, sneering.

Their resemblance was eightfold. Towering figures, arms bare—though not bulky, their muscles were evenly toned, skin darkened from rigorous body refinement.

“You two wish to challenge me? I am the First Disciple of Heaven Gate, winner of the Alchemy Grand Tournament!” Lo Tian smirked.

“Haha! We are Iron Gate’s First and Second Disciples—called the ‘Iron Skin Brothers’!”

“Choose your duel: art or combat?” One youth boasted.

“I’ve got ‘Steel Helmet’—why bother with arts? Fight both of you at once! A duel against two is too time-consuming!” Lo Tian scoffed.

“What?” The youths blinked, expecting Lo Tian to choose art. They’d planned to teach him a lesson with wit.

“Is this fool mad? He dares to think himself someone! Facing two, does he know who they are—Zhao Ticheng and Zhao Tiancheng?” The crowd gasped.

“You’re Zhao Ticheng and Zhao Tiancheng? I know your names now. Come, let me kill you!” Lo Tian taunted.

“Pathetic names. Not as bold as Zhao Ritian! My elder brother Zhao Ritian dared to defy heaven!” Lo Tian bellowed, still arrogant.

“Big brother, stay here. I’ll tear this fool apart!” Zhao Ticheng seethed, charging at Lo Tian like a leopard.

“Fool! I am the First Disciple of Heaven Gate! You don’t believe me?” Lo Tian roared, then leapt, cracks splintering beneath him. He became an arrow, rushing toward Zhao Ticheng.

“Idiot! Do you not know Iron Gate’s body refinement is unmatched in the lower realms? No one dares challenge their flesh!” The crowd sneered.

“Ticheng, watch out!” Peng Tiande barked, his eyes anxious. Though others saw nothing, True Immortals discerned the subtleties.

“Crack!” Thunderous sound echoed as Lo Tian and Zhao Ticheng collided. Both recoiled, but Lo Tian stood firm while Zhao Ticheng was hurled back, blood gushing from his mouth, eyes wide with disbelief.

“How?!” All gasped, stunned by Lo Tian’s stance.

“Strike while the iron is hot!” Lo Tian ignored their shock, his fists glowing with golden seals. He lunged at Zhao Ticheng.

“Mountain-Striking Impact!” As Lo Tian advanced, Zhao Tiancheng reacted instantly, his hands forming a seal. He vanished, transforming into a golden mountain.

“Should’ve fought together! Too late!” Lo Tian sneered, his aura now fierce and dominant. The crowd saw a different man—arrogant yet formidable.

“Boom!” Lo Tian’s fist smashed the golden mountain, shattering it. A storm of wind swept outward. Lo Tian stood triumphant, gazing at Zhao Ticheng’s recoil.

“Boom!” Both fell, blood spewing, eyes wide with disbelief.

“How?!” They stammered. Their prideful flesh had been bested by Lo Tian, whom they’d scorned.

“Don’t delay—no more chances!” Before they rose, Lo Tian’s hands formed seals. His body swelled rapidly, occupying half the arena. His aura surged.

Chapter 1880: Let Me Off Once()

A hundred-foot figure stood, its oppressive aura suffocating. Chaos Heaven Sect disciples noticed Lo Tian’s giant form.

“Damn, is this fool mad again? Last time he turned giant, chaos ensued!” As Lo Tian grew, Chaos Heaven disciples trembled, wary of his form.

“Ten Thousand Ancient Steps… Shatter Eternity!” A cold voice echoed. Golden feet, brimming with power, descended upon Zhao Tiancheng and Zhao Ticheng.

“Defend!” They trembled, staring at the foot ready to crush them. No longer did they mock Lo Tian.

“Dragon Arm!”

“Mountain-Striking Impact!” They roared, rising. Golden mountains and arms clashed with the golden foot.

“Boom!” The arena shook. The golden foot exploded, scattering spiritual energy.

Dust settled. A massive footprint remained. Zhao Tiancheng and Zhao Ticheng lay, weak, their bodies battered, spitting blood.

“Unsurpassed flesh of Iron Gate!” Lo Tian mused. He’d underestimated their resilience.

Yet his words seemed arrogant, especially to Peng Tiande, who reddened. It was a slap in the face—Iron Gate’s flesh was unmatched.

“Again!” Lo Tian chuckled, another golden foot advancing toward the pale Zhao brothers.

“Stop!” Peng Tiande could no longer sit idle. If Lo Tian’s foot landed, they’d die.

“Haha, old Peng, leave youth to their own!” Li Changfeng sneered, appearing before Peng Tiande.

“Li Changfeng, release them. I owe you a favor!” Peng pleaded.

“Haha, Lo Tian, your call!” Li Changfeng laughed, addressing Lo Tian.

“Hum…” The golden foot halted half a zhang away. Stone fragments flew, and Zhao brothers trembled, having narrowly escaped death.

“Today I spare you. Next time, you must do the same!” Lo Tian gazed at Peng Tiande, smiling.

“Fine. Any terms are acceptable!” Peng nodded. It was nearly nothing.

“Swear blood oaths!” Lo Tian smiled. He had no enmity with Zhao brothers, so he’d avoid killing them—yet gain Peng Tiande’s favor.

“Fine… I swear!” Peng frowned but vowed.

“Go back.” Lo Tian smiled, his giant form collapsing into normal size.

No one now looked down on Lo Tian. His power had proven itself—two feet nearly crushed Zhao brothers. Who else could do that, especially with flesh?

Zhao brothers, trembling, returned to Peng Tiande. Their breaths were ragged.

“I am the First Disciple of Heaven Gate, Alchemy Grand Tournament champion, Dragon Battle Rankings top! Still don’t believe?” Lo Tian resumed his arrogance.

“Bragging. This fool’s been faking it all along!” All thought, even Li Changfeng was deceived. He knew Lo Tian was strong but not this much.

“Cen Weihong, is this your ability?” A voice echoed. People’s eyes lit up.

“Cen Weihong and Li Piaoyun’s duel is key. If Cen wins, Heaven Gate triumphs; if he loses, Lo Tian must face Li Piaoyun!” People murmured.

“Let them fight each other to death!” Sect masters prayed. To them, none of the three sects were good.

“Li Piaoyun, emerge for battle! Hide no longer!” Cen Weihong brandished his black sword, aura darkened like a demon. His eyes burned crimson.

He danced the black blade, sending waves of energy outward. Sparks flew as collisions echoed.

“Too fast! Can’t see Li Piaoyun’s form!” People gaped.

“No, it’s his spiritual sense. He conceals himself with it, revealing only when attacking!” Li Changfeng frowned.

Cen Weihong was at a disadvantage, not due to skill but spiritual sense—Li Piaoyun’s was leagues ahead.

“Any art, when perfected, yields miracles!” Sima Xiu smiled, watching Cen Weihong’s wounds. Though small, they left him battered.

“Dangerous! This time Cen Weihong is in peril. Though strong, he can’t find Li Piaoyun’s traces—how to fight?” People discussed.

“Trouble. Should I help him?” Lo Tian mused, sensing Li Piaoyun’s presence.

“His movement is like a cloud—here and gone. Even his weapon vanishes!” Lo Tian muttered, the only one seeing Li Piaoyun’s actions.

Spiritual sense: Li Piaoyun was invisible, his transparent sword moving around Cen Weihong. Each flaw he exposed, Li Piaoyun struck. If anyone else, they’d have fallen long ago. Cen Weihong’s endurance proved his strength.

“Wenhong, you’re not doing it. Stay calm. Don’t let hatred cloud your eyes. Every attack has a trace. If desperate, trade injury for injury—life for life. No one is fearless!” Lo Tian mentally advised Cen Weihong.

“Huh?” Cen Weihong paused, pondering.

“Opportunity!” Li Piaoyun’s eyes flashed. His transparent sword lunged at Cen Weihong’s back.

“I understand!” Cen Weihong snarled, twisting to evade the vital spot. His black sword glowed with dark light.

“Puff!” The invisible sword pierced Cen Weihong’s shoulder. Blood stained the blade, revealing its form.

“Die!” Cen Weihong ignored his wound. His black sword struck the void.

The sound of a blade piercing flesh echoed, shocking all. Cen Weihong had broken the stalemate.

“Brilliant—trade injury for injury!” Li Changfeng clapped, impressed. Cen Weihong’s boldness was unexpected.

“Breaking the deadlock!” Others gasped, praising Cen Weihong’s courage. Only Sima Xiu glanced at Lo Tian with surprise.

Cen Weihong panted, blood gushing from his shoulder. He glanced at Lo Tian with gratitude.

“Unbelievable. You devised this plan!” Li Piaoyun smiled, appearing with bloodstained white robes.

“But after so long and heavy wounds—what strength do you have left to fight?” Li Piaoyun waved his sword, blood droplets falling. It returned to invisibility.

“Remember where you lost?” Li Piaoyun’s hands moved, air tearing. A terrifying pressure built before him.

“Soul-Stealing Sword!” Cen Weihong’s face darkened, as if a wound was reopened. He stared at Li Piaoyun.

“I’ve prepared a technique for you. I’ve never used it, hoping to meet you and strike your heart, sever your head, dismember you!” Cen Weihong’s voice held no fear. His black sword trembled.

“Heart-Shattering Sword!” Cen Weihong roared, dark spiritual energy swirling around his blade. It formed serpents, then merged into the sword.

“Hum…” The black sword erupted, sending waves of energy before Cen Weihong. He channeled it toward Li Piaoyun.

Chapter 1882: Let Me Off Three Times()

“Sima Xiu, what are you doing?” Li Changfeng sneered, rising to block Lo Tian and Cen Weihong. His face bore admiration.

“Li Changfeng, I must kill Cen Weihong today. Otherwise, this isn’t over!” Sima Xiu’s aura surged.

“You have two choices: hand Cen Weihong over, and we’ll remain peaceful. Or fight now.” Sima Xiu threatened.

“You’re nothing. How dare you interfere with my people? If you wish to fight, so be it. Heaven Gate fears no one!” Li Changfeng retorted coldly.

“Good, good, good!”

“The Earth Gate declares: three months early, the contest for heavenly ascension begins. Location to be decided!” Sima Xiu said three times, his voice icy.

“Good! Heaven Gate will comply!” Li Changfeng replied boldly.

“Well, then we’ll meet on the Ancient Battlefield!” Peng Tiande smiled. They’d lost no one today, and would be the victors.

The three sect masters finalized the deal, causing other sect leaders to frown slightly.

“Then we’ll take our leave!” Li Changfeng sneered, summoning a dragon circling the sky.

“Go!” Li Changfeng coldly ascended, Lo Tian and Cen Weihong on the dragon’s back.

“Roar!” The dragon bellowed, wings flapping, vanishing from view.

“Finished. Return home,” Peng Tiande smiled to the sect leaders. The Chaos Heaven Sect had won—those who came would weaken, making them the third major sect.

……

On the dragon’s back, Li Changfeng stood solemnly. Lo Tian and Cen Weihong behind him.

“Master, your bravery was unmatched! I revere you!” Lo Tian praised loudly.

“You fool. Don’t flatter me. Your performance surprised me—how fast you’ve grown!” Li Changfeng mused.

At this moment, Lo Tian’s status surpassed Cen Weihong in Li Changfeng’s eyes. How long had Lo Tian been in Heaven Gate?

“You two are the sect’s future. When we win the heavenly contest, entering the middle realms, you’ll be Heaven Gate’s face. So neither of you must suffer. From now on, resources are yours to claim!” Li Changfeng advised.

Hearing this, Lo Tian and Cen Weihong straightened. They knew Li Changfeng valued their talent, earned through prior battles.

“Master, those sects must have allied. I guess they’ve at least three already joined the Earth Gate. Given their strength, why didn’t they keep us?” Lo Tian asked softly—his biggest confusion.

Li Piaoyun and Sima Xiu had openly clashed, yet Sima Xiu hadn’t detained Li Changfeng. He chose the heavenly contest instead.

“Do you think they’d let us go if given a chance?”

“They could, but they dared not!” Li Changfeng smiled. He waved his hand, seven figures appearing before Lo Tian and Cen Weihong.

“Good job!” Xue Changshan’s voice rang out, smiling at Lo Tian.

“This…” Seeing six figures, Lo Tian and Cen Weihong were stunned. All elders except Xuan Dan had arrived.

“Now I see why they dared not act—The Elders are here!” Lo Tian smiled.

“They’re not fools… neither are they. If a fight broke out, they’d lose,” Li Changfeng chuckled, guiding the dragon toward Heaven Gate.

Seven days passed swiftly. Lo Tian and others reached the vast Dragon Mountain. The Chaos Heaven Sect trip had been relatively smooth, save for not intimidating Chaos Heaven.

Lo Tian didn’t mind. He knew what chaos he’d caused there. Also, he’d reclaimed Guiwang and four half-True Immortals’ ghostly items—this pleased him greatly.

“Li Master and Cen Senior have returned!” The dragon circled the Dragon Mountain, causing people to gasp.

“Did you intimidate them? What conditions did Chaos Heaven agree to? They must have given up resources!” People murmured.

“But where is Zhao Ritian?” Soon, they noticed a missing figure.

“Zhao Ritian died during battles with other sects. From now on, Zhao’s family is supported by the sect. One of them may enter Heaven Gate inner disciples!” Li Changfeng announced solemnly, causing a stir.

“What? Zhao Ritian died?” People were stunned. So many top talents had perished on the Dragon Battle Rankings.

“Honoring Cen Weihong! He killed Earth Gate’s disciple Li Piaoyun, and others… kill…” Before people finished murmuring, Li Changfeng’s voice echoed again. Each name invoked chaos.

“Earth Gate’s Li Piaoyun! My heavens, Cen Senior killed him!” Heaven Gate disciples were stunned.

“Cen Senior! Glorious!” This news made all disciples cheer. Such a triumph was worth their excitement.

“Cen Senior, your prestige will rise again!” Lo Tian smiled at Cen Weihong.

Hearing this, Cen Weihong blushed. He knew if not for Lo Tian’s ‘Soul-Striking Sword,’ he’d have been killed by Li Piaoyun.

Meanwhile, Cen Weihong also understood Lo Tian’s strength—superior to his own. He knew Zhao Ticheng and Zhao Tiancheng’s power; Lo Tian had easily crushed them. If not for Peng Tiande’s intervention, they’d have died.

“Enough battles. Rest. Three days later, you two must escort two ascended individuals to the middle realms!” Li Changfeng smiled.

“Show off in the middle realms. But stay low—middle realms are more complex than lower ones. If trouble arises, even we can’t cover for you!” Li Changfeng advised.

“Finally heading to the middle realms?” Lo Tian smiled. This was his chance to rescue Sun Keinian and Yu Changtian—no opportunity in Heaven Gate.

“Yes…” Lo Tian and Cen Weihong nodded, flying toward He Feng.

Under the disciples’ reverent gazes, Lo Tian and Cen Weihong returned to Lo Tian’s courtyard.

“Rest. I have matters to ponder,” Lo Tian told Cen Weihong, then retreated into his room.

“Huff…” Lo Tian exhaled deeply, recalling everything in Chaos Heaven. He felt an unusual frustration and anger at Guan Hongsheng’s gaze.

“Hum…” Lo Tian waved his hand. Cold energy spread in his room. Guiwang appeared.

Black hair, dark face—his entire body was blackened, surrounded by eerie ghostly energy. Except for color, he resembled a human.

“Apologies for your suffering!” Lo Tian felt guilty, knowing Guiwang understood him.

Guiwang stood silent, gazing at Lo Tian. It made him uneasy.

“I know you’re不服. A mid-True Immortal controlling you!”

“Fine. Save my life three times, and I’ll grant your freedom!” Lo Tian saw Guiwang’s disdain. If not for the Three-Headed Dog, Guiwang might have killed him with one strike.

“Fine…” Guiwang’s eyes flashed. His cold voice echoed.

“They didn’t place a restriction on you, did they? Guan Hongsheng?” Lo Tian smiled. Three lives were enough for him.

“He did, but it failed!” Guiwang spoke softly, voice devoid of emotion, even awkward.

“Failed?” Lo Tian’s eyes lit up. Interest sparked.

Chapter 1883: Escorting Sun Keinian

“Did he fail?” Lo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He’d had no clue about Dao-Heart Planting, but Guan Hongsheng’s failed attempt gave him a breakthrough.

“Wenhong, I’ll retreat. Don’t let anyone disturb me—even Xuan Dan!” Lo Tian told Cen Weihong outside.

“Hey, Guiwang, change the deal. Save my life twice, but cooperate with me—let me study you!” Lo Tian rubbed his hands, addressing Guiwang.

“Fine…” Guiwang shivered instinctively but nodded.

“Then trouble…!” Lo Tian finished, approaching Guiwang with a smile. Yet it made Guiwang feel an inexplicable chill.

……
For the next three days, Lo Tian remained in his room, never stepping out. Cen Weihong stood outside for three nights.

“Roar…” A piercing scream echoed constantly. Cen Weihong was puzzled—each time this scream rang, his skin prickled.

“Is he with that ghost?” Cen Weihong speculated, fearing a possibility.

“Haha…” Lo Tian’s wild laughter echoed in Cen Weihong’s ears, filled with arrogance.

“Guan Hongsheng wants to control me! Just because he can!” Lo Tian’s voice echoed.

“Creak…” The door burst open. A wild aura spilled out, violent and cruel. A dark soul seal hovered over Lo Tian’s head, five black spiritual dragon seals coiling around it.

A boy stood beside Lo Tian—his seven-colored braid stood high. He spat seven-color flames, burning the five black dragons.

The spiritual dragons were eroded by the soul seal and seven-color flames, leaving Cen Weihong astonished.

A black figure stood in the corner—its eyes were weak, trembling. Cen Weihong was shocked by what Lo Tian had done to a True Immortal-level Guiwang.

“Crack… crack… crack…” As Cen Weihong marveled, the five black spiritual dragons began to collapse.

Lo Tian’s eyes were sunken, bloodshot. Each dragon’s collapse made him spit black blood. A strange aura emerged from the blood.

“Haha! Finally succeeded!” Lo Tian laughed, elated. After three days of thinking and trying, he’d found a way to replace his alchemy elixir with the soul seal. Using its power and seven-color flames, he’d eroded the restriction.

“I’m returning…” Guiwang coldly spoke. His voice trembled, recalling his torment by Lo Tian—burned over ten times with seven-color flames. How could he not fear?

“Trouble…” Lo Tian smiled, grateful, then returned Guiwang to the soul seal.

“Wait for me. I’ll free your restrictions,” Lo Tian mentally told Long Jie and the Three-Headed Dog. He collapsed onto the ground, weak.

Three days were a trial for Lo Tian—his spirit and cultivation were drained.

“Even at great cost, I’ve finally solved this!” Lo Tian smiled. Three days were better than thirty or even three years.

“Freedom feels so good!” Lo Tian sighed, feeling his cultivation was back—no longer for others.

“Lo Tian, Cen Weihong. Come to the Heaven Peak!” Li Changfeng’s voice echoed in Lo Tian’s ears.

Lo Tian swallowed a pill, then stored the soul seal and seven-color flames. He slowly stood, legs trembling.

“Go. Wenhong, help me!” Lo Tian told Cen Weihong. He carried Lo Tian into the air toward Heaven Peak.

At that moment, Heaven Peak was crowded with disciples. A fat man bound in ropes stood there, flanked by a youth in pale blue robes.

“This is an ascended individual? Nothing special!” Disciples murmured.
