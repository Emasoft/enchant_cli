"Don't get too excited!" Eternal Immortal King extended his hand, a massive sword materialized in his grasp. Another item appeared—a storage ring, unmistakably Longyuan and Luotian's.

"Roar..." As Longyuan touched Eternal Immortal King's palm, a thunderous roar echoed, radiating malevolent energy.

"Crack..." Eternal Immortal King crushed the storage ring with a single hand, scattering treasures, medicinal herbs, and elixirs into the sky.

"No!" Eternal Immortal King's expression darkened; he found no Book of Epochs. For him, this was a failure. If the Book of Epochs had been present, even countless casualties would have been justified.

"This brat has accumulated quite the collection," Ghost King remarked, his gaze fixed on Longyuan's sword clutched by Eternal Immortal King. "Eternal Immortal King, at the peak of his cultivation, and millions of disciples—this exchange was worth it."

"Leave," Eternal Immortal King's voice was cold, his gaze sweeping over the smug immortal kings.

Heaven-Embracing Immortal King shared Eternal Immortal King's grim expression; his Heaven-Embracing Sect had been sealed by several conspirators for an hour, so he'd just arrived.

"Then we'll be on our way," several peak immortal kings addressed Eternal Immortal King, taking flight. To them, Luotian's residual soul had entered the cycle of rebirth—surely it would not persist.

"Stubborn fool," Heaven-Embracing Immortal King murmured, gazing at Eternal Immortal King before vanishing.

...

In the Reincarnation Hell, Black-Cloaked Luotian sat upon the Reincarnation Wheel. Suddenly, his body trembled, spitting blood as his aura rapidly withered.

"What's wrong?" Black and White Death, along with Fu Xingxuan, materialized instantly, their eyes scanning Luotian's fading aura.

"Master's body has perished! Only a residual soul remains!" Black-Cloaked Luotian whispered weakly, his voice trembling. His body slumped forward, eyes closed, life fading.

"What did this brat do?" Black and White Death's expressions shifted, their voices hushed.

"Luotian!" Fu Xingxuan's eyes bore worry; he felt Luotian's aura rapidly dissipating. If this continued, catastrophe would follow.

"Go to the Yellow River!" Black and White Death ordered Fu Xingxuan, summoning a small boat. Their figures vanished onto the gray bridge.

... The boat entered the Yellow River, Black and White Death landing upon it—this was their second time navigating against its currents.

The Yellow River possessed immense purifying power; even Black and White Death could not endure prolonged exposure. The oar sliced through the river, and they pressed forward, disappearing into the Reincarnation Hell.

...

"Where am I? Who am I?" A phantom soul sped through the gray Reincarnation Passage, confusion etched in its gaze.

Phantom souls surrounded it, all seeming to fear it, their gray eyes filled with reverence.

"Luotian!" As the phantom soul drifted, a guttural roar echoed—infused with endless hatred.

A solid soul surged toward Luotian, causing the surrounding phantoms to recoil in terror. This soul was far stronger than the others—another peak immortal king's soul, also sent into the Reincarnation Passage by Eternal Immortal King.

The soul seethed with resentment, retaining complete memories—yet its recollections slowly faded. It owed its existence to Luotian; thus, it sought to annihilate him utterly.

"Roar..." The soul's roar intensified as it lunged toward Luotian's residual soul.

Chapter 2481: Reincarnation's Ambush

Luotian, disciple of the Ghost Valley, single-handedly ascended Eternal Mountain, leading two world-shaking masters to incite chaos. Millions of disciples perished; Eternal Immortal King was wounded, one peak immortal king slain, six early-stage immortal kings dead.

This feat spread rapidly across the Immortal Realm, shaking its foundations—such audacity was unprecedented.

Nine immortal mountains ruled the realm for eons, yet no one dared challenge Eternal Mountain alone with such ferocity.

Once, Calligraphy Immortal claimed to be the strongest true immortal, but he merely clashed with Ghost Valley Mountain. All three heavens knew he'd only wounded an early-stage immortal king; Ghost King had barely acknowledged him.

Yet Luotian had truly shaken Eternal Mountain, single-handedly damaging its core. Though he failed—costing his life—he had become legendary across the Immortal Realm.

"Indeed, a Ghost Valley disciple—unfledged yet so formidable. Tragic, for the Immortal Realm cannot accept him," murmured the realm's people.

In the Three Heavens, at Tianyuan Sect, news of Luotian's death left everyone stunned.

"Luotian is dead!"

"How could that be?" All gasped, Longjie's wails echoing. His bloodline was linked to Luotian; now it vanished, confirming his demise.

"Kill! Rally the forces—attack Eternal Mountain!" Cao Dedu roared, eyes bloodshot. Tianyuan Sect erupted into motion.

"Big brother!" Chen Zhanbiao bellowed, his breath ragged, roaring like a beast. His aura surged wildly as he charged toward the sect's gates.

"Zhanbiao, stop!" Meng Xue shouted, blocking Chen Zhanbiao. But he teetered on madness; his breaths came in gasps, eyes locked onto Meng Xue.

"Move aside—I'll avenge big brother!" Chen Zhanbiao roared, his aura unstable. If not for Meng Xue's presence, he'd have struck already. Only three could restrain him: Xu Liyi, Luotian, and Meng Xue.

...

Tianyuan Sect disciples rushed to assemble at Cao Dedu's command, recalling Luotian's past. Without him, they'd still be in the Star Domain, never seizing Heaven's mandate. The Immortal Realm had no place for them.

"Whimper..." Two large black dogs whimpered, waiting at Tianyuan Sect's gates since Luotian left. Yet he never returned.

Three figures stood at the sect, eyes wild—Longjie, Nan Gong Yuqing, and others. Their breaths came in gasps, awaiting the disciples' assembly, their thirst for vengeance clouding reason.

Three women sat motionless in a room, tears streaming as disbelief gripped them.

Moments later, Tianyuan Sect's disciples assembled, their battle cries and killing intent rising to the heavens.

"Stay calm!" Fire Master Meng Wushuang struck Chen Zhanbiao, subduing him.

"Luotian chose to leave—so you wouldn't die in vain!"

"We're not yet equal to Eternal Mountain!" Xiang Tianming appeared, sorrow etched in his gaze. Though older, he retained reason.

"None can stop us!"

"This feud must be avenged!" Nan Gong Yuqing's eyes were icy, his gaze fixed on Fire Master and Xiang Tianming.

"Kill! Kill!" Tianyuan Sect disciples roared, their cries echoing for miles. The Three Heavens' other sects trembled; Tianyuan Sect had become a titan, unchallenged.

"You're going to die!" Meng Wushuang barked, watching the agitated figures. He marveled at their brotherly bond.

"Nothing can stop us today!" Cao Dedu roared, his authority unyielding.

"Uncontrollable," Xiang Tianming and Meng Wushuang realized these men were beyond reason. They couldn't kill them, nor could their cultivation suppress the chaos.

"WHAT are you doing!" As Xiang Tianming hesitated, a clear voice echoed—three figures materialized, calming the crowd.

Jiang Sxi, Sun Mengru, and Gu Qiansnow appeared—only these three women could halt the men.

"Return!" Jiang Sxi commanded, her voice authoritative as she surveyed Nan Gong Yuqing and Chen Zhanbiao.

Jiang Sxi understood Luotian's intentions; she couldn't let his brothers die in vain. Suppressing her sorrow, she stood, knowing Luotian's comrades would go mad.

"Must we endure this?" Nan Gong Yuqing asked, aware the women suffered equally.

"Revenge will come, but charging now is suicide. How many can we kill?"

"Strength—enhance our strength. When ready, we'll avenge. This reckless charge would waste Luotian's sacrifice!" Jiang Sxi spoke, scanning Nan Gong Yuqing.

"From now on, I am Tianyuan Sect's master—no objections, Cao Dedu?" Jiang Sxi gazed at Cao Dedu.

"None..." Cao Dedu replied; Jiang Sxi as master was inevitable.

"All right, disperse and discuss revenge!" Jiang Sxi declared. "Eternal Mountain is unreachable, but in the Middle Heavens, we can act!"

"Today begins our unification of the Middle Heavens!" Jiang Sxi coldly declared, her resolve returning as she shed Luotian's wife persona.

"Yes!" Longjie and others roared, ceasing their cries for vengeance. Their fury met not Eternal Mountain but its Middle Heavens affiliates.

"Deserved!" Each Middle Heaven sect with grudges against Luotian rejoiced.

"Big brother, rest in peace," Ye Liangchen wept, whispering.

"Little one, how could you be so foolish to challenge Eternal Mountain?" Ye Wudao's eyes held sorrow.

The entire Middle Heavens, even the Upper Heavens, erupted in chaos. On Heaven-Embracing Mountain, Lei Yong and Ji Chen stood, their killing intent fierce—yet subdued by Heaven-Embracing Immortal King.

"Strength—we must enhance our strength!" Lei Yong roared, his voice thunderous, aura unstable.

"Alas..." Heaven-Embracing Immortal King sighed deeply; he hadn't expected Luotian's return to stir such turmoil.

While the Immortal Realm trembled over Luotian, his soul drifted through the Reincarnation Passage.

The weak peak immortal king's soul sensed Luotian's frailty, instinctively craving to devour him.

"Roar..." Worse still, countless souls with resentment surged toward Luotian's cry—these were Eternal Mountain disciples' souls, killed by Longyuan's冲击. Their hatred remained, though much memory had been purged in the Reincarnation Passage.

Luotian's residual soul was bewildered, weak yet instinctively unleashed a staggering aura—this came from his Soul-Subduing Master heritage.

An invisible wave erupted, sweeping outward. All souls trembled, disintegrating into wisps of ash absorbed by the Reincarnation Passage.

The peak immortal king's soul gaped in horror—Luotian, a mere residual soul, was so formidable.

Instinctively, Luotian inhaled, drawing the ash into his soul, solidifying it slightly.

"I am Luotian," he whispered, recalling his name—though still confused, he instinctively clashed with the peak immortal king's soul.

The peak immortal king's soul was strong, but Luotian, a Soul-Subduing Master, had an innate advantage. Their battle was evenly matched—only by biting and tearing could they consume each other.

All souls retreated, watching the two powerful souls clash in the vast Reincarnation Passage. A single misstep meant annihilation, no rebirth.

Their speed was blinding; the Reincarnation Passage's purifying force weakened them. Luotian, a residual soul, eventually faltered.

"Rippling..." Yellow river water appeared, radiating ultimate purification. The souls struggled desperately, refusing to enter the yellow current.

"Is this the Yellow River?" The peak immortal king's soul gaped, staring at the yellow water.

"I don't want to be purified!" The peak immortal king's soul knew entering the Yellow River meant erasure—his existence would vanish, reborn.

Peak immortal kings were rare; if he could escape and find a way out, perhaps he could reclaim a body. Though slim, it was better than losing everything.

Yet the peak immortal king couldn't flee—powerful waves pressed upon his soul, forcing countless souls into the Yellow River.

Meanwhile, Luotian continued biting the old man's soul.

"Plunge..." Two solid souls fell into the Yellow River, the old man howling as ultimate purification weakened him.

On the other side, Luotian's residual soul seemed unaffected by the Yellow River's purifying force, continuing to tear at the old man's soul.

Chapter 2482: Reincarnation Palace's Heir

The Yellow River churned, two souls clashing. Luotian gradually gained the upper hand; the old man's soul weakened, eyes growing hazy.

After an indeterminate time, the old man became translucent, his final roar of defiance swallowed by Luotian's consumption.

"Where am I?" After devouring the old man, Luotian remained confused, drifting atop the Yellow River.

"Kid, you really are a pain in the neck. I knew you'd return—just not like this!" A voice echoed above the Yellow River—Black and White Death, rowing a boat.

Black and White Death seized Luotian's residual soul from the Yellow River, lifting it onto their boat.

"You're quite the fighter—being reduced to this, who did you anger? Not those guys, I hope?" Black and White Death muttered, observing the gray soul.

Drifting on, the boat returned to Hell. A figure stood at the gray bridge, worry etched in her gaze. Upon seeing Black and White Death, she leaped forward—a ghost tortoise roared from the Yellow River, and she landed atop it, approaching the boat.

Instantly, the ghost tortoise reached Black and White Death's side, spotting Luotian's phantom soul.

"Luotian!" Fu Xingxuan's eyes welled with tears; she felt his weakness—should he fail, he'd be scattered.

"Go!" Black and White Death took flight, retrieving the boat. They carried Luotian's soul and Fu Xingxuan to the Reincarnation Wheel.

No hesitation, Black and White Death chanted divine laws, fusing Luotian's soul into his body.

"Buzz..." As the soul merged, Luotian's aura ceased its withering, gradually reviving. Black and White Death sighed in relief.

"Wait and see—when he wakes, check for changes. His soul injury was severe; we don't know if there'll be side effects," Black and White Death sighed, stepping out. Fu Xingxuan remained to watch over him.

"Please be alright," Fu Xingxuan prayed, her gaze filled with worry.

Time passed slowly—after a month, Luotian showed no signs of waking. Fu Xingxuan was desperate.

Every day, she administered countless soul-nourishing herbs to hasten his recovery.

Luotian felt as if he'd had a long dream, experiencing much...

"Ah..." Luotian suddenly screamed, sitting up, sweat pouring from his brow.

"Luotian!" Fu Xingxuan, who'd watched him closely, smiled upon seeing him rise. She embraced him tightly.

"Xingxuan, what's happening?" Luotian blinked in confusion, feeling he'd lost much.

"Early-stage immortal king? Kid, your strength is still early-stage!" Black and White Death muttered, recalling their last meeting with Luotian—just entering early-stage.

"Luotian, what did you do? Why are you like this?" Fu Xingxuan examined him, finding no issues before questioning.

"I didn't do anything! I was always in the Reincarnation Palace, just feeling like I'd slept for a long time..." Luotian furrowed his brow, gazing at Fu Xingxuan with confusion.

"You..." Fu Xingxuan instantly sensed his change, gazing at Black and White Death.

"He's lost some memories!"

"His soul injury was too severe," Black and White Death frowned, watching Luotian.

"He's amnesic..." Fu Xingxuan furrowed her brow, yet relief washed over her—Luotian still recognized her.

"Regardless, he's safe!" Fu Xingxuan gently held Luotian, unwilling to part from him.

"What's wrong with you two? You're acting strange!" Luotian murmured, standing slowly.

"Let's go out and move around—this place is stifling!" Luotian urged Fu Xingxuan, leading her out of the Reincarnation Wheel.

"Whether it's good or bad..." Black and White Death sighed, watching them leave.

... Hell remained dim, its ghostly qi thick—especially in the Reincarnation Palace, where it was a potent elixir for ghost cultivators and creatures.

"Reincarnation Palace's Heir has emerged!" Their appearance instantly stirred the Reincarnation Palace disciples—Fu Xingxuan's presence always caused a stir.

"Wait, who is the one beside the Heir?" Next, people erupted—seeing Luotian by Fu Xingxuan's side. After all, Luotian had once appeared as Luo Chen and become the Heir.

The Reincarnation Palace disciples erupted in chaos, their eyes filled with anger as if they'd devour Luotian alive.

"He's Luo Chen—accurately, he's Luotian, our Reincarnation Hell Heir!" Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, causing the disciples to gasp.

"Luotian! The one on the Hell's Death List?"

"How could that be? He's not Luo Chen from Beast Ghost King City?" The disciples were stunned, disbelief in their eyes.

"If Wu Mian learns of this, he'll surely return!" They thought of Wu Mian's Hell Death List.

Many Reincarnation Palace disciples had returned from Kanmen, knowing Luotian's past strength.

"I refuse! Why let an Immortal Realm cultivator be our Heir?" A voice roared, its tone provocative.

"Exactly! Why let an Immortal Realm cultivator be our Heir? If it were truly Luo Chen, that'd be one thing—but now a cultivator leads us, we'll be mocked!" The crowd erupted in voices, sparking共鸣.

"What's wrong with them?" Luotian furrowed his brow, puzzled by their behavior.

"Alas..." Fu Xingxuan sighed softly; she'd forgotten this and hadn't realized Luotian had too.

"Luotian is Luo Chen!" The news spread through the Reincarnation Palace, drawing more disciples who surrounded Luotian and Fu Xingxuan.

"Kill him!" A voice shouted, the situation clearly complicated—someone had incited them.

Luotian gazed at the crowd but found no one, too many to pinpoint.

"I hereby declare: From today, Luotian is my Reincarnation Palace Heir. In a century, he'll assume the Reincarnation Palace's throne!" Black and White Death's voice echoed.

"Yes, we obey the Heir's decree!" With Black and White Death's words, even if disciples opposed, they couldn't act—Black and White Death were gods in the Reincarnation Palace.

"None of you should object! Originally, if not for him, how could we control two Hells?" Black and White Death's voice calmed the crowd.

The crowd dispersed, but the discussion lingered among disciples—many remained discontent, yet dared not speak due to Black and White Death's authority.

As the event unfolded, Luotian and Fu Xingxuan lost their desire to wander, returning to the Reincarnation Palace.

"Luotian, you've lost your memories!" Fu Xingxuan had to inform him; though she enjoyed this situation.

"Lost memories—probably painful ones I don't wish to recall," Luotian chuckled, recalling but finding nothing. He smiled at Fu Xingxuan.

"I know some things; I'll tell you," Fu Xingxuan, unaware of Luotian's actions in the Immortal Realm, knew his deeds in the Nine Domains. She felt responsible to inform him.

"Good enough!" Luotian didn't care much, feeling nothing but hearing it as a story.

Upon returning to the Reincarnation Palace, Fu Xingxuan recounted the Nine Domains' past, captivating Luotian—though he treated it as a story.

"Wow, I was so strong before! And five wives?" Luotian gazed at Fu Xingxuan, truly forgetting—only memories of Luo Family and Reincarnation Palace remained; he knew his name was Luotian.

"Never mind, things are this way now. I'll stay here and focus on strengthening my power—now I'm the Reincarnation Palace Heir, no other identities. The Immortal Realm and Nine Domains mean nothing to me!" Luotian shook his head gently.

"Alas... you're like this..." Fu Xingxuan felt conflicted, guilt-ridden—she didn't know what to do.

"Master Black and White Death, is there a way to restore his memories?" Fu Xingxuan asked, unwilling for Luotian to continue this way.

"I'll think about it; stay with him," Black and White Death replied, then fell silent.

"Stay here—don't return to your quarters; the Reincarnation Palace disciples now hold bias against you," Fu Xingxuan advised.

The news of "Luo Chen is Luotian" spread slowly, not just in the Reincarnation Palace but other halls too.

"Let an Immortal Realm cultivator be Heir? The Reincarnation Palace's Master is mad!" Other halls' people murmured, yet their masters—peak powers—remained silent, as if accepting it.

Chapter 2483: Wu Mian's Return

A massive city, a luxurious palace—purple-robed elder sat, his face dark.

Ghost King, Duan Zijue, had long sought to create descendants after Luotian killed his offspring.

Yet for some reason—perhaps Duan Zijue's age—his wives and concubines had no news.

"Luotian is Luo Chen!" Duan Zijue's eyes turned icy; he remembered his most favored son, Duan Boyang, who died at Luo Chen's hands.

"This could be exploited; I alone might not achieve it—need to find others," Duan Zijue coldly spoke, his obsession with offspring making him cruel.

... Other Heavenly Kings received the news; now Hell's power had shifted—most of the Eight Heavenly Kings' offspring returned to their respective factions, becoming new Heavenly Kings.

"Luotian is Luo Chen—unexpectedly he's lingered in the Reincarnation Palace so long!" In Beast Ghost King City, new Heavenly King Wang Gang's face bore contemplation.

"Big brother, Ghost King contacted us—should we visit?" Wang Lie stood beside him, addressing Wang Gang.

"Visit; let's observe—see if this Luotian can survive," Wang Gang spoke, leading Wang Lie out of Beast Ghost King City.

"Years apart, yet in this identity!" Other Heavenly Kings sighed; some were old acquaintances of Luotian.

A lone mountain—youth stood, his posture proud, back bearing a long spear, face smiling—this was Yang Huanyu, whom Luotian had met in Hell.

"You've finally returned—wonder if my preparations are enough!" Yang Huanyu murmured, sitting in meditation.

Hell's winds stirred, a hidden current—not only did the Eight Heavenly Kings send people to the Reincarnation Palace but also some from the Ten Yama Halls.

Kanmen, a military camp—Wu Mian sat, surrounded by soldiers, his face grim.

"Lord, that Luotian killed many of us—this can't be ignored!" A soldier spoke.

"He's the Heir; I can't act now. Let me check what happens in the Reincarnation Palace—should it be possible, I'll make him pay!"

"Current battles are imminent; don't slacken while I'm away," Wu Mian instructed, addressing the group.

"Luo Shui, come with me!" Wu Mian addressed a middle-aged man seated nearby, his face aged.

Luo Shui had joined Kanmen, surviving battles, advancing in cultivation to become a regiment commander.

"Yes!" Luo Shui stood quickly, his heart bitter—he'd sensed Luotian wasn't his son but hadn't spoken up. Now it was common knowledge; Luo Shui had to face reality.

... Time passed seven days—Luotian remained unaware of the commotion his appearance caused.

"Crack..." Black ghostly claws emerged, cold energy radiating from the void, seizing a mountain peak.

Luotian hadn't been idle; he'd practiced his martial arts, yet couldn't recall his Immortal Realm knowledge.

"Book of Epochs?" Luotian furrowed his brow, discovering the Book in his mind on the second day. He remembered it but couldn't access its contents—only a black spear emerged from it.

"Really lost much—I must've been weaker before. Where's Longyuan? Where are the elixirs and herbs?" Luotian muttered, frowning. He remembered the Book of Epochs and the Black Spear.

"Never mind," Luotian sheathed the spear, returning to his quarters—Fu Xingxuan was guarding the Otherworldly Flowers in the Yellow River, unable to wander often.

As Luotian returned to his quarters, a figure appeared outside his courtyard.

"Luotian!" A cold voice echoed in his ears, making him frown slightly.

"Who?" Luotian felt a chill, opening the door to see the figure—its face devoid of features. Luotian's body shivered, instinctively fearing it.

"I fear him?" Luotian thought, gazing at Wu Mian and Luo Shui.

"Dad!" Almost instantly, Luotian spoke softly, gazing at Luo Shui's aged face.

Due to his Hell memories, Luotian felt a fatherly bond toward Luo Shui.

"Dust!" Luo Shui's body trembled, seeing Luotian mirror his son's image. His eyes welled with tears.

"Wu Mian, why have you returned to the Reincarnation Palace from Kanmen?" Luotian dared not underestimate Wu Mian, a veteran strength.

"To seek answers for my subordinates killed by you!" Wu Mian's voice was cold, dismissing Luotian's Heir status.

"I'm the Heir—next Master! My rank surpasses yours; how can you seek answers?" Luotian replied softly, though wary of Wu Mian.

"An Heir? I sacrificed for the Reincarnation Palace; where were you?" Wu Mian's voice echoed.

"General, please consider my years of dedication—spare him!" Luo Shui pleaded for Luotian.

"Luoshui!" Wu Mian's voice held shock; he'd expected Luo Shui to rage but instead found him begging.

"Only because he called me dad!" Luo Shui's bitterness was clear, his plea heartfelt.

"Rascal! Your son Luo Chen is dead!" Wu Mian roared, slapping Luo Shui.

"Crack..." Luotian's body appeared before Luo Shui, striking Wu Mian.

Both retreated, Luotian colliding with Luo Shui's body, his gaze icy toward Wu Mian.

"I respect you as a master; don't push too hard!"

"From now on, Luo Shui is no longer Kanmen's commander but the Reincarnation Palace's elder!" Luotian declared, his Heir status granting him authority.

With Wu Mian's return, Reincarnation Palace disciples received news, gathering toward Luotian's courtyard.

"An Immortal Realm cultivator—how can he be our Heir!" A voice roared.

Luotian saw the disciples' shouts, his heart chilled—his past deeds had earned their respect. Now they reneged.

"Since you seek answers, I'll give them—Hell values strength; let's settle this on the arena. Come!" Luotian coldly spoke, walking toward the central arena.

"Good—this is a man!" Wu Mian roared, stepping after Luotian.

Bloodstained arena—Luotian stepped on it, gazing at Wu Mian: "No holds barred. If you can kill me, do so; if not, return to Kanmen!"

"Good—didn't expect you to grow this strong," Wu Mian stepped on the arena, his black spear materializing.

"Kill him!" Reincarnation Palace disciples roared.

"Kill!" Wu Mian struck, his spear piercing, moving with him to target Luotian's throat.

"Killing technique!" Luo Shui muttered, concern in his eyes—having followed Wu Mian for years, he knew his strength. Wu Mian's martial arts were all killing techniques.

"Buzz..." Luotian's Black Spear materialized, his feet echoing the Yellow River's rhythm. He spun, sweeping the spear toward Wu Mian.

"Good kid!" Wu Mian's spear missed, stunned by Luotian's speed. He changed his strike to a sweep, blocking Luotian's spear.

Crack... Thunder echoed on the arena as two spears collided, both retreating.

"Strong!" Luotian and Wu Mian thought in unison before charging again.

Two spears danced, clashing endlessly—Wu Mian's attacks were ruthless, each aimed at Luotian's life. A hit would leave him wounded.
