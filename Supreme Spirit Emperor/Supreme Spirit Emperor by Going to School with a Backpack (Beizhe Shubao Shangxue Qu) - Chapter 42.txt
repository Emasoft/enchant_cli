Luo Tian possessed a robust physique, yet the wine of the Tiger Clan had a potent aftereffect. Even Luo Tian felt slightly dazed, his mind hazy and sluggish, unwilling to waste his Qi to dispel the alcohol's influence.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, attempting to rid his mouth of the wine’s scent. He rested his head on his hands, gazing at the moon in the sky, his face displaying an unusual calm. At this moment, Luo Tian stood motionless, gazing at the moon in a trance, his eyes half-closed. His spiritual awareness extended outward, sensing the movements of every blade of grass and leaf around him, as if he had fallen into a deep slumber.

Leng Qiuchan’s face was obscured by a black veil as she slowly sat before Luo Tian. She, too, had a slight intoxication; under the hospitality of the Tiger Clan’s people, it was her first time ever drinking alcohol.

Dazed and disoriented, she instinctively felt a warmth nearby. Her light body collapsed beside Luo Tian, her face pressed against his chest. Soon after, even breaths emerged from her lips.

The entire Tiger Clan lay under the moonlight’s embrace, once more returning to tranquility.

“Hmph…” A cold snort shattered the Tiger Clan’s peace.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan both opened their eyes simultaneously, a moment of awkwardness passing between them. Their positions were undeniably suggestive.

Leng Qiuchan’s supple leg rested upon Luo Tian, and her arm similarly draped over his chest.

Luo Tian, however, felt unbearable discomfort. Up until now, he remained an uninitiated youth; naturally, his body responded to the situation. Coincidentally, Leng Qiuchan’s light leg had positioned itself precisely there, causing his face to flush crimson.

Leng Qiuchan also paused in astonishment, sensing the anomaly on her leg. Her eyes reflected panic, and for a moment, she remained frozen, unsure of how to proceed.

“Tiger Clan! Submit or be annihilated!” A cold voice pulled them back to reality.

Leng Qiuchan regained her composure, her face burning with heat. She vowed within herself that she would never drink again.

Luo Tian, too, felt embarrassed but as a man, he straightened his expression and murmured, “The Tiger Clan seems to have trouble. Let’s go check it out.”

“Fine,” Leng Qiuchan replied, her voice still cold. Yet Luo Tian detected an undertone of flight in her tone.

He let out a light laugh, watching the black-clad figure recede into the distance before he clapped his head and darted toward the Tiger Clan’s village.

Chapter 202: The Crisis of the Tiger Clan

Chapter 202: The Crisis of the Tiger Clan

“Tiger Clan! I’ll ask once more—submit or be destroyed. Three breaths, answer me!” The voice of the black-cloaked figure was deep but carried far.

Startled by this sound, the Tiger Clan’s warriors and their followers emerged hesitantly from the mountain fortress. Upon seeing the black-cloaked figure, their faces bore expressions of solemnity; their long hunting experiences had honed an acute sense for danger.

Feeling the immense power of these black-cloaked figures, Hu Xiu Cheng whispered, “Who are you?”

“One breath!” The cold voice of the black-cloaked figure responded.

“We are descendants of the Tiger God. We submit only to the Tiger God!” Hu Xiu Cheng’s gaze was resolute, his staff clutched tightly in hand.

“Two breaths!” The black-cloaked figure ignored him, continuing to speak. Yet his group of followers had already drawn their curved blades, which gleamed with a faint chill.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan arrived at the village’s perimeter, their faces displaying confusion upon seeing these dozens of black-cloaked figures wielding curved blades.

They noticed the weapons of these figures were far superior to those of the Tiger Clan, though not classified as Yellow-rank weapons, they were still quite formidable.

“These people seem like us—they’re not locals,” Luo Tian observed the weapons, deducing these figures were not native to this region. His face bore a trace of concern.

“Clearly, the water source Taoist temple has sealed off all exits. It’s impossible for anyone to enter. So how did these people get in?” Leng Qiuchan also felt puzzled.

“Are you from that tower?” Hu Xiu Cheng shouted, but was met with a cold reply.

“Three breaths! Kill!” The black-cloaked figures’ voice echoed.

Following this, dozens of figures transformed into streaks of black lightning, charging toward the Tiger Clan’s fortress.

“Hold them back! Don’t let them enter the village—there are our wives and children. Brothers, follow me!” Hu Xiu Cheng roared like a mountain tiger, brandishing his staff and charging toward the black-cloaked leader.

Two forces clashed like two torrents of water—one cold and ruthless, the other fierce and fiery. The scene momentarily became chaotic.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan remained still, observing the situation. They would rescue those injured but soon found themselves overwhelmed as more casualties arose. Though the Tiger Clan’s morale was fierce, their strength and weapons paled in comparison to the black-cloaked figures. Soon, the Tiger Clan suffered heavy losses.

“Go contact the Wolf Clan and Leopard Clan. Tell them we’re under attack—ask for their support!” Hu Xiu Cheng shouted, but the black-cloaked figures overheard and sneered.

“Hmph. No need to call. They’re probably receiving the same treatment as you!” The black-cloaked figures’ laughter echoed.

“Pf…” Hu Xiu Cheng’s face showed shock upon hearing this. He hadn’t expected other clans to suffer the same attack. In that brief moment of hesitation, two wounds appeared on his back.

Indeed, other clans were also in dire straits. This was a massacre; wherever the black-cloaked figures went, no one survived. Roars of fury echoed from all directions.

“Have the clans awakened their guardian beasts?” Hu Xiu Cheng, hearing the thunderous roars, felt fear.

The Tiger Clan’s ancestral rule stated that unless faced with annihilation, no one was allowed to disturb the guardian beasts’ peace.

Yet now, roars of fierce beasts echoed from all sides. Hu Xiu Cheng knew other regions were likely worse off.

“Who are you?” Hu Xiu Cheng’s eyes reflected despair as he watched his clan members fall.

“Kill…” Seizing Hu Xiu Cheng’s momentary lapse, the leader of the black-cloaked figures sneered and slashed his curved blade toward Hu Xiu Cheng.

Hu Xiu Cheng’s face turned pale with alarm. This blade, like a crescent moon, flashed toward his neck with blinding speed, leaving him no time to react.

His mind filled with anguish—once he died, the Tiger Clan would become even more vulnerable. These cruel black-cloaked figures would then turn their attention to the elderly, women, and children.

“Go…” A cold voice interjected with a sharp collision sound. A black spear repelled the curved blade.

Luo Tian’s slender figure appeared before Hu Xiu Cheng, his face cold as he lifted the dazed Hu Xiu Cheng.

“Luo Brother!” Hu Xiu Cheng’s face lit up with joy. He had witnessed Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan’s strength before; if they aided the Tiger Clan, there would be a chance.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian asked solemnly. With the Tiger Clan suffering heavy losses, he and Leng Qiuchan could not save them all. Thus, they too joined the battle against the black-cloaked figures.

Leng Qiuchan, without using her Qi, was stronger than the Tiger Clan’s warriors but only slightly so compared to the black-cloaked figures. Facing three of them was already her limit.

At this moment, fewer than fifty Tiger Clan warriors remained standing. In contrast, the black-cloaked figures had only twenty wounded—this was the cost of the Tiger Clan’s one hundred and fifty casualties.

Hu Xiu Cheng, seeing his clan members’ heavy losses, tears streamed down his face. These people were like family and brothers to him; now they lay dead in blood.

As Hu Xiu Cheng mourned, Luo Tian had already clashed with the leader of the black-cloaked figures. The sound of clashing weapons echoed between them.

“Ode to the divine protector of the Tiger Clan! Please emerge and safeguard your faithful followers!” Hu Xiu Cheng knelt on one knee, his face filled with reverence. The elderly and infirm of the Tiger Clan also knelt on one knee, their hands clasped in prayer. They chanted something fervently.

A strange fluctuation emanated from every Tiger Clan member, rising toward the altar deep within their village.

Hearing Hu Xiu Cheng’s chant, the black-cloaked figure’s face lit up with joy: “Finally… it has emerged.”

“Roar…” A tiger’s roar echoed beneath the Tiger Clan’s altar, and cracks formed on its surface.

A thunderous explosion erupted as the altar shattered under the Tiger Clan’s reverent gaze.

Chapter 203: The Powerful
Chapter 203: The Powerful

With the roar, a snow-white tiger leaped from beneath the altar, its presence met with reverence by the Tiger Clan.

“Beast! Finally emerged!” The black-cloaked figure sneered at the imposing white tiger.

Upon its emergence, the white tiger spotted Hu Xiu Cheng and others. Its face bore an almost human-like tenderness, emitting a low growl. With a raised paw, it released green light that flowed toward the wounded Tiger Clan members.

“Wood Attribute Qi!” Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan were stunned, surprised to find the existence of Qi in this world.

The Wood Attribute Qi possessed potent healing abilities, swiftly mending the Tiger Clan’s wounded.

“Roar…” After this, the white tiger let out a thunderous roar, its cold gaze fixed on the black-cloaked figures still slaughtering the Tiger Clan.

“Good it has emerged!” The leader of the black-cloaked figures sneered, then pulled out a talisman. He coldly hurled it toward the white tiger before summoning a black net into his hands, tossing it into the air. He ignored the white tiger’s emergence and continued battling Luo Tian.

“Bad!” As the black-cloaked figure revealed the black net, Luo Tian immediately knew it was no ordinary object. To prevent any mishaps, he unleashed his Qi and thrust his spear toward the black-cloaked figure.

The black-cloaked figure had already divided his attention; Luo Tian, without using Qi, could already suppress him. With Qi activated, the black-cloaked figure was no match for Luo Tian.

A streak of dark light pierced through the black-cloaked figure’s throat.

“Pf…” The black-cloaked figure spat blood, his face filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian’s spear had caught him off guard; he felt a blur before his throat felt cold, and his breathing became difficult.

“Good!” The Tiger Clan’s people, seeing Luo Tian pierce the black-cloaked leader, erupted in joy.

The remaining thirty or so Tiger Clan warriors seemed to have taken a stimulant, their morale soaring. Under Leng Qiuchan’s leadership, they charged like arrows into the disarrayed black-cloaked figures.

Seeing Luo Tian use Qi, Leng Qiuchan gritted her teeth and summoned the remaining three-tenths of her black Qi, unleashing formidable power against the black-cloaked figures.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan felt deep regret for their initial hesitation in using Qi, which had led to such heavy losses. This made them feel deeply sorrowful.

Especially Luo Tian, though he had only met the Tiger Clan for a day, he could sense their warmth and boldness, as well as the purity within them.

Because of his hesitation, so many had perished—those who died were yesterday still looking up to him with admiration. When he pierced the leader, Luo Tian saw only gratitude and reverence in the Tiger Clan’s eyes.

The more he thought about it, the worse he felt. He held nothing back and unleashed his “Rending Heaven Spear,” killing black-cloaked figures one after another.

Leng Qiuchan shared a similar sentiment; a dark black sword appeared in her hand, far stronger than the one she had used before. Black Qi surrounded her as she slashed through the black-cloaked figures.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan fought like tigers descending from the mountains, cutting through the enemy ranks.

Initially, the Tiger Clan merely watched, but soon they didn’t need to fight at all—they simply stood by as the two’s unstoppable momentum terrified the black-cloaked figures.

Within a few hours, they had slaughtered all these dozens of people, their cries echoing from the black-cloaked figures. The two were now stained with blood, resembling demons from hell.

“Pf…” Luo Tian threw the last enemy to the ground, exhaling deeply. His face bore a sorrowful expression; he didn’t care how much Qi remained in his body. If possible, he would sacrifice all his Qi to save the pure-hearted Tiger Clan’s lives.

Leng Qiuchan’s face, obscured by her black veil, was equally grim. Though her Qi had been exhausted, she didn’t care about trivial matters—this confused her, as the ruthless woman she once was had changed so much in these two days.

“Roar…” A painful tiger’s roar echoed from the altar.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan both turned their gazes toward the source of the sound—the Tiger Clan’s guardian beast, the white tiger.

But the white tiger’s condition was not good; it was tightly wrapped in a black net, its once-white fur now faintly surrounded by dark Qi.

Hu Xiu Cheng’s face was filled with anxiety; this white tiger had accompanied the Tiger Clan throughout its growth, protecting them. Now that this aged white tiger was in trouble, he looked to Luo Tian for help.

“Luo Tian Brother! Please save our clan’s guardian beast!” Hu Xiu Cheng knelt before Luo Tian, his eyes filled with hope.

Luo Tian quickly moved to lift Hu Xiu Cheng before he could kneel: “Brother Xiu Cheng, I’ll try my best!”

Luo Tian hurried to the white tiger’s side and extended his spiritual awareness, his face showing concern. Though he knew this white tiger was powerful, the black net clearly suppressed it.

“Soul-Subduing and Spirit-Capturing Net!” Leng Qiuchan’s face showed surprise as she whispered.

“You know it?” Luo Tian was overjoyed; at least now he had a clue.

“Soul-Subduing and Spirit-Capturing Net! A tool used by邪修 (heretical cultivators) to capture souls and subdue beasts. It hasn’t been seen in a long time—unexpectedly, I’ve encountered it here!” Leng Qiuchan’s face was grim as she explained.

“Is there a way to free it?” Luo Tian asked again, eager for solutions.

Ignoring him, Leng Qiuchan whispered and her hands moved rapidly. She then shouted at Luo Tian: “Transfer your Wood Attribute Qi to me!”

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, summoning his Wood Attribute Qi and placing his hand on Leng Qiuchan’s back.

Feeling Luo Tian’s warmth, Leng Qiuchan shivered slightly; her movements were so subtle that even Luo Tian didn’t notice.

Luo Tian watched Leng Qiuchan’s intricate hand signs with admiration, sensing the technique was extraordinary. Even her hand signs were more complex than his “Human King Seal.”

Chapter 204: The Greenwood Emperor
Chapter 204: The Greenwood Emperor

“Hum…” A powerful Qi fluctuation formed in Leng Qiuchan’s hands, creating gusts of wind that blew Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan’s bloodstained clothes.

The Tiger Clan warriors felt the Qi fluctuation and looked at Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan with fervent eyes. To them, the two were now as divine as the white tiger; their Qi fluctuations matched those of the Tiger Clan’s guardian beast.

Hundreds of Tiger Clan warriors knelt on the ground, gazing at the young man and woman standing atop the altar. Their faces bore ecstatic expressions.

An hour passed, though to Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan it felt long. Luo Tian clearly felt his Wood Attribute Qi was exhausted!

Leng Qiuchan, too, had tried her best. Knowing Luo Tian was a Five Elements Body, she believed he must have Wood Attribute Qi within him. Her clan had a secret technique to break the Soul-Subduing and Spirit-Capturing Net, but it required pure Wood Attribute Qi.

Leng Qiuchan was a dual-element cultivator (Wood and Darkness), so she had learned this technique before. However, she had never used it and didn’t know how much Qi it would consume. Moreover, the source of this Qi was this frail boy.

“Is he really a Body-Transformation cultivator?” Leng Qiuchan marveled, disbelief in her eyes. After so many battles, this man still had so much Qi left!

“If it doesn’t succeed, I can’t hold on!” Luo Tian felt the last drop of green Qi in his body was about to vanish and urged her.

“Almost there!” Leng Qiuchan’s tension was high; her slender legs trembled slightly, and sweat moistened the veil on her face, revealing a perfect contour.

“Green Emperor of Wood! Crush all!” Leng Qiuchan roared, and a surge of Wood Attribute Qi formed from her hands.

Luo Tian stood behind her, clearly sensing the aura of an emperor emanating from her hands.

Luo Tian was astonished at Leng Qiuchan’s identity; he still hadn’t guessed who she belonged to.

Her formidable power and unique imperial aura were rare; few could possess such an aura. Based on these two points, Luo Tian knew Leng Qiuchan’s identity was far superior to his. Her faction must be stronger than the Five Elements Sect, perhaps even more powerful than the Yellowness Sect.

The surrounding Tiger Clan warriors felt the imperial pressure from the Qi and trembled, deepening their reverence for Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan.

The old white tiger felt the overwhelming Wood Attribute Emperor’s aura, its painful gaze filled with a flicker of fear.

“Wood Emperor’s Blade! Form!” Leng Qiuchan roared again.

The fierce Wood Attribute Qi, under her control, gradually coalesced into a massive Qi blade.

She slightly swung her hand and guided the Wood Emperor’s Blade toward the black net on the white tiger.

Under the hopeful gazes of the Tiger Clan and Luo Tian, the Wood Attribute Qi-formed Emperor’s Blade struck the white tiger.

To everyone’s surprise, the black net on the white tiger, which had been flowing continuously, seemed to flee like a mouse encountering a cat. It gradually dissolved under the Emperor’s Blade.

The white tiger, upon contact with the Wood Emperor’s Blade, suffered no harm; instead, its wounds from the black net healed under the nurturing Wood Attribute Qi.

After about an hour of continuous strikes, the black net finally vanished into the heavens.

“Roar…” A long tiger’s roar echoed through the Tiger Clan.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan both looked pale; Leng Qiuchan could only stand with Luo Tian’s support.

Luo Tian couldn’t determine how long the white tiger had lived, but he could clearly sense its immense power—approximately at the Bone-Transformation Initial Stage. However, it was restrained by the black net, nearly losing its life.

The white tiger leaped forward and stood before Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan, its face showing a human-like expression. It let out a low growl and bit Luo Tian’s robe, pulling him up.

Leng Qiuchan heard the white tiger speaking in strange words and responded with a series of odd sounds.

Luo Tian was curious, unsure what language it was.

The white tiger heard Leng Qiuchan’s words and suddenly trembled, its face showing intense disbelief. It then growled at Leng Qiuchan.

Leng Qiuchan, hearing the tiger’s growl, looked puzzled and spoke another series of strange sounds.

Luo Tian was even more curious; watching this man and tiger exchange growls, it seemed like a conversation. He marveled at Leng Qiuchan’s identity, unable to believe there was anyone who could converse with a beast that hadn’t fully awakened its intelligence.

The Tiger Clan people were even more respectful, kneeling in reverence. Leng Qiuchan’s ability to converse with their guardian tiger proved that Luo Tian and she were of the same level as their protector.

“She wants to take us somewhere!” Leng Qiuchan told Luo Tian.

“Uh… where?” Luo Tian was exasperated, unsure what the man and tiger were discussing.

“Roar…” The white tiger growled again, its massive body crouching down.

“It seems they want to check other villages!” Leng Qiuchan said, a bit embarrassed as she looked at Luo Tian.

The white tiger’s intention was clear: to have the two sit on its back. However, despite the spaciousness of its back, it would be cramped for two people—this position was quite intimate.

Luo Tian noticed Leng Qiuchan’s awkwardness and quickly realized it, smiling: “You must be out of Qi. You sit first; I can keep up!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Leng Qiuchan sighed in relief but also felt a hint of regret. She recalled the warmth of his chest from last night.

“Hmph!” She stifled the regret and climbed onto the white tiger’s back, speaking a series of strange words.

The white tiger’s eyes showed a hint of amusement; its pure white head nodded slightly, and it growled before leaping forward.

Luo Tian saw the white tiger’s incredible speed and said a few words to Hu Xiu Cheng before lifting his feet and chasing after it.

Chapter 205: The Wolf Cub
Chapter 205: The Wolf Cub

The white tiger dashed wildly, but Luo Tian, though a Body-Transformation cultivator, couldn’t keep up without using Qi. He cursed repeatedly, wishing his hands could become feet.

They stopped and moved on for about an hour. Luo Tian had no time to admire the scenery, but finally, the white tiger stopped at a place resembling a mountain fortress.

Seeing the white tiger stop, Luo Tian panted heavily. This level of running without Qi supply was only possible for him; others would have died from exhaustion long ago.

Leng Qiuchan’s face, obscured by her black veil, showed a smile—she was delighted to see Luo Tian struggling.

However, she soon stopped smiling as a thick scent of blood penetrated her veil.

The white tiger roared, its sound echoing into the mountain fortress, but no response came back.

Luo Tian frowned and extended his spiritual awareness, sensing the scene within the fortress. His face turned pale.

“Roar…” The white tiger roared again, but Luo Tian could hear a note of sorrow in its cry.

Luo Tian’s heart heavy, he felt the fortress had no signs of life—hundreds of corpses lay scattered on the ground, including the elderly and children. None had survived.

The white tiger vanished from its spot, appearing on a sacrificial altar similar to the Tiger Clan’s.

The broken altar had no life beneath it, clearly another native tribe’s site. They hadn’t been as fortunate as the Tiger Clan; the entire village had been slaughtered, and even their guardian beast was taken.

The white tiger let out a mournful roar before leaping onto the altar, and Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan followed.

The area beneath the altar was vast and not cold, nor did it have any peculiar features.

However, after extending his spiritual awareness, Luo Tian felt a faint pulse of life—though weak, he could clearly sense its presence.

The white tiger sniffed the air and also detected this faint life.

With the tiger, they moved toward a pile of grass. The tiger’s paw gently pushed aside the grass, revealing a small wolf-like cub. Its eyes were cautious as it gazed at Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan.

“Roar…” The white tiger growled, then opened its mouth and gently picked up the cub, placing it in Leng Qiuchan’s hands.

“Ah…” The cub didn’t sense any hostility from the three and let out a low cry.

“It… is hungry…” Leng Qiuchan held the cub in her arms, looking at Luo Tian with a troubled expression.

“Uh…” Luo Tian was stunned, his face awkward—this tiny creature obviously needed milk.

But he was male and had no such thing. As for the white tiger, it clearly wasn’t female. In this empty fortress, only Leng Qiuchan was a woman.

Luo Tian instinctively glanced at Leng Qiuchan’s chest, but upon seeing her cold gaze, he quickly withdrew.

“What should we do?” Leng Qiuchan asked the white tiger and Luo Tian, her voice low. She had no solution either; the three stood staring at each other.

“Ah! I remember!” Luo Tian recalled Long Baobao’s habit of eating pills in the Great An Forest. He slapped his head.

He extended his spiritual awareness and retrieved a pill from his storage ring, its Qi radiating strongly.

“Ah…” The cub let out a cry and flew from Leng Qiuchan’s arms, biting the pill in Luo Tian’s hand.

“What a greedy little thing!” Leng Qiuchan smiled as the green cub returned to her arms after swallowing the pill.

“It’s also very flirtatious!” Luo Tian frowned, watching the cub lying on Leng Qiuchan’s chest with a content expression.

Seizing the opportunity, he snatched the cub and held it up: “Little thing, from now on, you’re with me. I’ll make sure you get sugar every day!”

Luo Tian tempted it again, taking out a pill with even stronger Qi.

The cub didn’t seem to hear Luo Tian’s words but drooled heavily onto his body, its eyes filled with longing for the pill in Luo Tian’s hand.

Luo Tian could sense the cub was extraordinary; even though he had been careless, this cub hadn’t matured yet but could snatch the pill from him without warning. What would it be like when it grew up?

“Luo Tian!” Leng Qiuchan gritted her teeth, eyes burning with anger.

“Do you want to raise this cub too? How will you do it? Do you have milk?”

Luo Tian smiled playfully at Leng Qiuchan.

“Go to hell!” Leng Qiuchan, not one for polite words, reached out to snatch the cub from Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled without dodging and handed the cub directly to Leng Qiuchan.

Seeing Luo Tian hand over the cub, Leng Qiuchan was stunned. She knew more about beasts than Luo Tian did and realized the cub’s uniqueness, which surprised her that Luo Tian would hand it over so calmly.

But she soon noticed why he was so calm—because the cub had returned to Luo Tian’s arms, its eyes filled with intense longing for the crystalline pill in his hand.

“See? It prefers me more!” Luo Tian’s face showed confidence.

“Despicable! Tell me, what conditions do you want to let it go? I’ll fulfill them after we leave!” Leng Qiuchan whispered.

“Hmm… since your identity is obviously not ordinary, just give me two low-grade weapons!” Luo Tian said calmly.

“Go to hell…” Leng Qiuchan, not one for patience, glared at Luo Tian’s audacity. Her face showed anger, as if she wanted to fight him.

Seeing her angry expression, Luo Tian spoke calmly: “You can’t even joke? Three mid-grade weapons!”

“Fine!” Leng Qiuchan didn’t hesitate to agree. Given her status, three mid-grade weapons were easily obtainable.

This time it was Luo Tian’s turn to be surprised. He had expected Leng Qiuchan to haggle, but she agreed immediately. The mid-grade weapons were as common as cabbages to her—this only deepened his curiosity about her identity.

Seeing Luo Tian’s embarrassment, Leng Qiuchan showed a hint of pride and took the cub from his arms. She also grabbed the pill he held, then growled at the cub, which finally calmed down.

Chapter 206: The Soul-Chain Tower
Chapter 206: The Soul-Chain Tower

“Roar…” The white tiger’s low growl woke the two from their argument.

They returned to themselves, and Leng Qiuchan once again sat on the white tiger’s back. The cub was now in her arms, and Luo Tian sighed before chasing after them.

“Leopard Clan… Bear Clan…” The two and the tiger traveled from place to place, but they found tragedies in other villages. Almost all had been destroyed; their guardian beasts were also missing. The entire space seemed to hold only the Tiger Clan.

After traveling through these places, Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan couldn’t find the fifteen people who had entered. They only found a broken long-life Taoist temple’s whisk, in a deer clan village.

Seeing the whisk, Luo Tian was shocked; he recognized it. It was the same one Chen Changsheng had used in the Great An Forest during their fight. He hadn’t expected to see it here, and this made him worry about Chen Changsheng’s safety. The deer clan’s guardian beast had not disappeared but left behind a dead reindeer with its antlers missing.

The two and the tiger traveled for three days, covering all villages but found no other special places. They only discovered a few survivors, whom Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan brought back to the Tiger Clan.

After returning to the Tiger Clan, Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan handed over the survivors to Hu Xiu Cheng for processing. Then, they and the white tiger entered the Tiger Clan’s altar.

A low roar echoed from the altar, as if telling something.

After a night, Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan emerged from the altar, their faces showing concern.

That night had finally revealed what was happening here.

Long ago, the white tiger and other guardian beasts were sealed within the altar, receiving offerings from various clans. Their strength remained unchanged for a long time without major incidents. Though sealed, they knew each other’s existence.

Over time, the white tiger felt the seal weaken and broke free. Other beasts with similar strength also broke out.

Feeling each other’s presence, they gathered and headed toward the golden tower, believing it would reveal their location.

But before they reached there, black-cloaked figures appeared—though not strong, their black net completely subdued them. They were captured and sealed back into each clan’s altar.

The white tiger only knew this tower was called the Soul-Chain Tower by these black-cloaked figures. After that, it returned to its previous life of darkness until yesterday when this peace was broken.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan had long suspected the golden tower was no ordinary place. Upon hearing the white tiger’s account, they became even more cautious. Their Qi had been restored to peak condition via pills because they planned to head toward the Soul-Chain Tower. They had spent too long in the Tiger Clan and feared others would arrive first.

“Boom…” A thunderous fluctuation echoed throughout the cave space.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan looked toward the source of the sound—standing in the distance, the Soul-Chain Tower radiated golden light in all directions.

Leng Qiuchan entrusted the cub to the Tiger Clan for temporary care, and they dashed toward the Soul-Chain Tower.
