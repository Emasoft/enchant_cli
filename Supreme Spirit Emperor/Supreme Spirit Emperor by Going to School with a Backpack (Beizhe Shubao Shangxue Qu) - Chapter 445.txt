“Ugh…” Upon hearing Du Hongxi’s words, Diaodezhu’s face instantly turned awkward. Seeing everyone’s gazes shift toward him, he instinctively straightened his posture before realizing this was no time for posturing.

“Ah… Lu Tian, I am a hero!” Diaodezhu looked at Lu Tian with a pitiful expression, addressing him.

“Impossible!” Lu Tian shook his head. Having known Diaodezhu for years, he would cover for him even if the latter had made mistakes—provided they didn’t cross his limits.

“Haha, only we can bully the dog!” Others also rallied behind Diaodezhu, their faces cold as they gazed at Du Hongxi’s group.

“Good!” Hearing Lu Tian’s words, Du Hongxi’s group didn’t seem upset but instead wore expressions of admiration. If Lu Tian had handed Diaodezhu over for these reasons, they might not have agreed to his conditions.

“Hmph, scaring me?” Diaodezhu instantly regained energy upon hearing Du Hongxi’s words, snorting dismissively.

“Alright, since no one has objections, let’s divide the Star River Seals and wait for the Red Battlefield to end!” Lu Tian smiled slightly, addressing everyone.

Jun Wulei and Wang Wang took out the Star River Seals while others collected their tokens from the Red Battlefield. After distribution, they quietly awaited the next trial.

Though Lu Tian didn’t obtain the inner disciple exam, he felt no regret. The entire celestial tide had been absorbed by the three hounds; Lu Tian could imagine what would happen if they awoke.

As for the inner disciple spot in Star River Mansion, Lu Tian desired it greatly but had no reason to retract his promise to Wang Wang and Jun Wulei. After all, he was a disciple of the Tian Dao Sect—though the sect had suffered recently.

After distributing the Star River Seals, Wang Wang and Jun Wulei wore awkward expressions. They hadn’t expected Lu Tian to still give them the seals, knowing it was solely due to their father’s old face.

“Lu Tian, from now on, don’t hesitate to ask for anything!” They expressed gratitude, as becoming an inner disciple could lead them to enlightenment. Yet Lu Tian had given up this precious opportunity for them.

“Lu Tian, where did you get the Thunder Dao Sword?” Before Lu Tian could reply, Du Hongxi’s group turned serious, their gazes fixed on him.

“I don’t know. I found it in a secluded place,” Lu Tian lied, fabricating an excuse.

“If you ever enter the Immortal Realm, don’t reveal this sword—it could cost your life,” Du Hongxi warned.

“Why?” Others looked puzzled, feigning confusion.

“You don’t know the origin of the Thunder Dao Sword. I can’t elaborate, but just don’t show it. Better keep it within your small world,” Du Hongxi glanced at Diaodezhu, withholding further details.

“Still recognized…” Lu Tian sighed inwardly, gazing at Du Hongxi’s group. He wasn’t sure if they’d keep his secret.

“Alright, everyone prepare!” Lu Tian nodded to Du Hongxi before the group resumed waiting for the third trial’s end.

Time passed slowly. After seven days, a cold voice echoed across the Red Battlefield, jolting Lu Tian’s group.

“Trial passed!” The voice faded as a golden gate materialized before them, slowly opening.

“Let’s go!” They exchanged glances, excitement on their faces, then leapt into the golden gate.

A surge of energy enveloped Lu Tian. In an instant, his feet met solid ground, and he surveyed the surroundings.

The room was modest yet simple. Yet several figures stood opposite him, sending a tremor through his spirit.

In front of him were elders—most notably the Star River Mansion’s artifact spirit, who had previously encountered. Beside it sat three figures he recognized: a massive dragon-tailed lizard, a ram-headed elder, and the puppet from the first trial.

“Elder,” Lu Tian bowed respectfully, puzzled why the artifact spirit had summoned him.

“You carry the Thunder Dao Sword!” The artifact spirit smiled, scrutinizing Lu Tian.

“By logic, I should kill you to protect Star River Mansion and hand the sword over to the sect,” it declared, locking eyes with Lu Tian.

“Elder, stop the nonsense. Tell me why you brought me here,” Lu Tian shook his head. Though he didn’t know the artifact spirit’s purpose, he sensed no malice—otherwise, he’d be dead already.

“Boy, don’t speak to elders disrespectfully!” One elder spoke, scanning Lu Tian with a powerful aura pressing down on him.

“Hmph?” Lu Tian frowned, feeling immense pressure that bent his knees.

“Enough. Let’s discuss business,” the artifact spirit waved, lifting the pressure. The elder returned to his seat.

“Logically, we should kill you. But now it’s different—Star River Mansion has scattered across three thousand small worlds. Even the Eternal Immortal King’s reach is limited,” the artifact spirit sighed.

“So we offer you a chance—a leap to greatness, though it carries risks. The cost is your life—our test,” it continued.

“If you survive, your cultivation will rival a world’s ruler, with potential to ascend to the Immortal Realm,” it added.

“Of course, there’s a condition: after you ascend to the Immortal Realm, inform Star River Mansion of your world’s location,” it declared without pause.

“A world ruler!” Lu Tian’s eyes gleamed. If the artifact spirit spoke truth, he’d become a world’s sovereign.

Yet his mind tensed. He knew rewards demanded sacrifices. The latter part—his life—was clear.

“Success means ascending to the stars; failure, death in Star River,” the artifact spirit intoned.

“Do I have another choice?” Lu Tian shook his head, locking eyes with the artifact spirit.

“No,” it replied. “Star River Mansion opens every century, recruiting gifted disciples. People assume the greatest opportunity is inner disciple spots, but few know about the core disciple position.”

“Becoming a core disciple grants the Tian Dao Foundation Pill,” it said softly.

“Tian Dao Foundation Pill!” Lu Tian’s heart pounded. The name alone hinted at its significance.

“Your task is the hardest trial—core disciple selection. Few have completed it since Star River Mansion’s inception, yet those who did achieved True Immortal Realm status,” it explained.

“Ready?” The artifact spirit nodded. “Begin.”

“Alright,” Lu Tian nodded, unaware of what awaited him but exhilarated. If he achieved the Tian Dao Realm, no problem in the Nine Domains would remain.

Chapter 1734: Immortal Qi Body

“Alright, let’s begin,” the artifact spirit nodded, raising a hand. Lu Tian vanished into the small room.

“Is this breaking rules?” Others watched him disappear, gazing at the artifact spirit.

“No harm done. It’s a test for the boy. If he succeeds, his talent and luck are evident. If not, no need to discuss,” the artifact spirit sighed.

“Finish others’ trials first; they’re all exceptional,” it instructed, then fell silent.

“Understood,” they nodded. With the artifact spirit in charge, there was no need to argue.

The elders vanished into the room, leaving only the artifact spirit. It wore a wistful expression.

“Hope you succeed. Among these, I favor you most. If you do, our return to the Immortal Realm gains hope,” it murmured, gazing at the scene.

“Buzz…” A hum echoed. Lu Tian’s body fell to the ground, earning a bitter smile.

Yet his eyes turned serious as he surveyed the scene. He stood beneath black stars, each emitting waves that made his heart tremble.

“Immortal aura!” Lu Tian gasped, eyes flashing violet. Upon recognizing the stars’ nature, he was stunned.

Green immortal qi surrounded pills suspended in space, sending tremors through his soul.

“Immortal pills! So many!” Lu Tian stammered, awestruck. Their aura mirrored those in the Burial Immortal Coffin.

Though excited, he didn’t act rashly. He knew this trial wasn’t simple.

“Buzz…” As he pondered, a meteor streaked toward him. Though beautiful, Lu Tian had no time to admire it—its aura signaled danger.

Even his body was变态; being hit wouldn’t be pleasant. He moved, grateful this space lacked severe suppression. If he couldn’t fly here, he’d have no choice but to accept his fate.

With a burst of speed, Lu Tian vanished, dodging the pill. He felt its powerful aura pass by, his lips twitching.

“Buzz…” As he exhaled relief, waves erupted in the starry void. The pills began moving, like a meteor shower, hurtling toward him.

“You motherf***er! This is trying to kill me!” Lu Tian panicked, using his幽冥鬼步 to evade the deadly pills.

“Crack…” Despite his speed, he was hit. A crack echoed as blood flowed from his wounds.

“Hmph…” Though the collision hurt, the pill shattered on impact, its immortal laws flowing through his wounds.

“Body strengthening!” Lu Tian marveled. The immortal qi was refining his body.

“Abnormal!” He felt the refined areas, exhilarated. If fully refined, his body would reach terrifying levels.

Now he understood the artifact spirit’s trial: refining the body with immortal pills. Yet it carried risks—being crushed by them.

“Be careful, I can handle this,” Lu Tian’s eyes gleamed. He dodged the pills, his movements fluid.

Meanwhile, others began their trials, all related to immortal qi, gradually enhancing their strength.

While Lu Tian and others trained in Star River Mansion, in the Thunder Sea Marsh, powerful figures emerged. These were second-life masters of the Ancient Clan, along with their royal offspring and prodigies.

“Gu Tianshu, Dongbo Xin, Ji Jiu You—fight!” A cold voice echoed from the second-life masters. The sound reverberated across the star domains.

“Rumors!” The Ancient Clan erupted, eyes filled with excitement as they gazed toward the Thunder Domain.

“Hear it’s the clan masters and prodigies training in the Thunder Sea Marsh. Now they’ve emerged—another battle!”

“Humanity, for years you relied on those three masters to suppress us. Now we’ve produced second-life masters. How will humanity defend? We’ll become the Nine Domains’ rulers!” Ancient Clan members roared, gathering toward the Thunder Domain.

“Damn it!” Hearing the battle cries, humanity’s people trembled. Sacred sects felt a terrifying crisis approaching.

“Our sect prodigies are all in Star River Mansion. The Nine Domains are unusually empty!” People realized the situation, fear deepening.

“Fight if you dare!” A bold voice echoed. Two figures emerged from the Divine Beast Ancient Cave—Dongbo Xin and Xuanyu Qiong.

In the endless fire sea, Gu Tianshu in white robes stood up, gazing at the Qiankun Sealing Tower beside him. “Elder, this is a major crisis.”

On the Broken God Cliff, Zhong Zixuan polished his golden divine sword, smiling. “Father, mother, the battle has begun!”

“This fight is crucial—it’s a path to enlightenment!” Zhong Zixuan’s eyes burned with battle spirit, leaping from the cliff.

“Kill…” Battle cries erupted in the Mortal and Thunder Domains, spreading across the domains.

“Humanity has masters!” Humanity roared back. Dongbo Xin’s bold words energized them, recalling the three无敌 masters. After years of recovery, humanity had grown stronger—though facing the Ancient Clan, they weren’t without a chance.

Both sides gathered. The Ancient Clan converged on the Thunder Domain while humanity headed toward the Four Sacred Star Domains. Once both sides were ready, battle would commence.

“Humanity’s masters, dare to fight in the Thunder Domain?” The second-life clan masters challenged.

“Good!” Dongbo Xin answered from afar, flying toward the Thunder Domain with Xuanyu Qiong. Gu Tianshu also stood up, vanishing into the fire sea.

Shen Wang Sun Shengtian, Diao Yuanshan from the Dragon Tomb, Yan Xiuluo from the Shura Domain, and Mo Zun of the Demon Clan—all second-life masters recently ascending to near纪元之主—flew toward the Thunder Domain.

“Children of the clans, fight! Take back what’s ours!” The second-life masters roared.

“Yesss…” Ancient Clan members surged from the Thunder and Mortal Domains, charging toward other domains.

“Kill…” The Nine Domains’ people roared, sending out a terrifying killing intent. They rushed back to their domains to counter the Ancient Clan’s invasion.

“This time, it’s a生死 battle!” The second-life clan masters and prodigies stood outside the Thunder Sea Marsh, eyes sharp as they gazed ahead.

“Buzz…” The sound echoed. Dongbo Xin and Xuanyu Qiong arrived, standing opposite them. Black and white qi surrounded them, their auras reaching the sky.

They had just arrived when Gu Tianshu and Zhong Zixuan appeared, standing beside them. Their eyes narrowed at the clan masters’ overwhelming auras.

“So many!” Diao Yuanshan turned into purple light, appearing behind Gu Tianshu. His face showed shock.

Figures moved swiftly; Sun Shengtian, Yan Xiuluo, and others arrived quickly but were stunned.

Eight masters stood there, their auras fierce. Behind them, nearly thirty Ancient Clan royal offspring and prodigies stood, eyes filled with battle spirit.

In contrast, humanity had only a dozen. Numerically, Gu Tianshu’s group was at a disadvantage.

“Where are your people? Don’t think this few can fight us!” Qi Hongrui sneered, gazing at Gu Tianshu. They knew Lu Tian’s group wasn’t in the Nine Domains, so they chose this time to attack.

“Back then, you dared not speak. Now it’s the same!” Dongbo Xin coldly replied.

Chapter 1735: Tian Dao Foundation Pill

“Arrogant!” The clan members roared, gazing at Gu Tianshu. They had long feared the three—Gu Tianshu, Dongbo Xin, and Ji Jiu You. Now their power had grown; they felt confident to defeat Gu Tianshu with eight masters. Diao Yuanshan and others were dismissed.

“Haha, come on!” The Jingu Clan’s prodigy stood proudly, gazing at Diao Yuanshan. “Where are Lu Tian? Let him fight!”

Tuyang Fei and others looked at humanity’s group, shouting.

The Ancient Clan royal offspring focused on Zhong Zixuan and Xuanyu Qiong, their battle spirit intense. Humanity had only these two纪元之主’s offspring.

“Disparity!” Diao Yuanshan felt heavy. Their forces were vastly unequal, and most importantly, they lacked纪元 treasures.

“Kill!” As the group spoke, battle erupted across the Nine Domains. Ancient Clan members slaughtered wildly.

Humanity fought back fiercely. Immediately, many fell on both sides.

“Kill humanity! Take over their sacred domains!” The Ancient Clan went mad, bloodstained air spreading across the Nine Domains.

“Do you really want to break your pact and start early?” Gu Tianshu’s face was icy, scanning Qi Hongrui.

“Does it matter now?”

“Yes, you can commit suicide before us. Then we’ll promise to restore humanity to its Ancient Clan days—slaves and food!” Qi Hongrui’s face was cold, gazing at Gu Tianshu.

“Traitor of the Beast Clan!” Diao Yuanshan cursed, glaring at Qi Hongrui.

“Then fight. It seems the old deterrent wasn’t enough,” a hum echoed. Gu Tianshu held a golden sword, his robes fluttering as he lunged at Qi Hongrui.

“Did you think I was still the one you could suppress?” Qi Hongrui shivered but then recalled his power and the opportunities from the Burial Immortal Coffin, regaining confidence.

“Buzz…” Before Qi Hongrui finished speaking, a golden light appeared before him. His face darkened.

The golden sword pierced the sky, its complex seals entering Qi Hongrui’s body.

Bloodstained, Gu Tianshu stood proudly beneath the stars. His long hair fluttered, his aura of invincibility sending shockwaves.

“Fast!” Everyone’s faces showed disbelief. Qi Hongrui was known for his strength—though he was the weakest among them, he was a second-life master.

“Unmatched!” Everyone gazed at Gu Tianshu with admiration. After years, his brilliance remained, still invincible—innate气质.

Elegant and superior to many second-life masters, the Ancient Clan royal offspring wore solemn expressions. They remembered Gu Tianshu’s invincible aura from before. Though they were now near kings and had gained opportunities in the Thunder Sea Marsh, facing Gu Tianshu still filled them with fear.

“Lucky he’s a second-life master. Otherwise, this era might have achieved enlightenment,” people sighed.

“Attack together!” Though Qi Hongrui was wounded, he was a second-life master and hadn’t been killed. He still had counterattack abilities.

Qi Hongrui’s words echoed, and East Bo Xin moved. His target was Qi Hongrui. Half god, half demon, East Bo Xin appeared before him, punching.

“Crack…” A sound echoed. Blood spewed from Qi Hongrui’s mouth, his face pale.

“I said back then I could suppress you. Now I still can,” East Bo Xin’s eyes were whirlpools, pulling people in.

“Invincible!” East Bo Xin and Gu Tianshu proved again. Even if they were second-life masters, their strength remained unmatched against four times their number.

“Where is Ji Jiu You?” Compared to East Bo Xin and Gu Tianshu, Fu Cangshan’s group felt weaker. They gazed at the two masters, fearing Ji Jiu You more.

“Kill!” But before they could ponder Ji Jiu You’s location, East Bo Xin and Gu Tianshu attacked them.

“Die!” Seeing East Bo Xin and Gu Tianshu’s actions, the second-life masters’ faces darkened. Though they were strong, two couldn’t defeat so many. Only a king could suppress them.

“Kill!” Xuanyu Qiong and Zhong Zixuan followed Gu Tianshu and East Bo Xin. Though not second-life masters, their lineage was terrifying—descendants of纪元之主. They believed they could fight second-life masters.

Battle erupted instantly. Diao Yuanshan’s group attacked, and the stars echoed with thunderous sounds as thirty-plus near-kings surrounded them.

Meanwhile, the Nine Domains erupted in a massive battle. Epoch peak leaders clashed endlessly.

Sacred sects resisted other Ancient Clan attacks, blood dyeing a star domain. From the battle’s start, the Nine Domains became a meat grinder—every moment saw Ancient Clan and humanity members dying.

Meanwhile, Lu Tian’s group in Star River Mansion remained unaware of external events, undergoing the trial.

“Haha… succeeded!” Wang Wang bled, gazing at a floating immortal qi-tinged token above his head. He activated his cultivation to refine it.

Jun Wulei’s situation was similar. As Wang Wang succeeded, Jun Wulei smashed a screen, revealing an immortal qi-tinged token.

Others also passed the outer disciple trial but lagged behind Wang Wang and Jun Wulei’s opportunities.

“Refining this token’s immortal qi, I might achieve enlightenment,” Jun Wulei smiled, sitting cross-legged beneath the token to refine it.

Others passed the trial. At this moment, Lu Tian’s body was rapidly strengthening. His aura was terrifying, but his appearance was terrible—bloodied, his robes torn, constantly evading the meteor-like pills.

During this time, Lu Tian nearly died several times, almost crushed by the immortal qi-infused pills. Yet he endured at the last moment.

Now, except his head, every part of him had been refined by immortal qi. He felt his physical strength could crush a near-king.

As Lu Tian refined his body, the starry pills decreased.

“Head…” Lu Tian hesitated. The head was crucial—soul’s seat. He feared being blown apart, his soul destroyed, rendering all efforts futile.

“Be ruthless!” He bit his teeth, gazing at the chaotic pills. A strange unease stirred in him.

“Come…” He made his decision, never changing it. His gaze was serious as he faced a meteor approaching him. He stood still and headbutted it.

“Crack…” A sound echoed. Next moment, Lu Tian felt like a normal person, his body trembling violently before falling toward the stars.

“Buzz…” Immortal laws flowed. A wave of immortal qi refined his head’s cracks.

“Not enough…” Lu Tian fell thousands of feet, regaining clarity. Tears nearly spilled from his pain but he roared, charging toward the pills.

“One… two…” Time passed. With each collision, his head—previously unrefined—gradually strengthened.

Lu Tian didn’t know how long it had been. When he regained consciousness, the stars held no pills.

“Completed!” Lu Tian’s eyes gleamed. He lightly tapped his head, excitement in his gaze.

“Huh?” But after a moment of joy, his face turned puzzled. He gasped.

“This… is the Tian Dao Foundation Pill?” Lu Tian’s voice held confusion, sensing a golden pill suspended in his dantian.

Chapter 1736: The Hardest Part

Lu Tian’s face was stunned, gazing at the golden pill in his dantian. Though small, he felt an aura capable of destroying him. If it exploded here, he’d surely perish.

“When did it enter my dantian?” Lu Tian was puzzled, not daring to touch the forbidden pill.

“If I refine this pill, my reincarnation channels will fully transform into immortal qi,” he mused, eyes gleaming.

“It must be that the previous immortal pills didn’t fully refine my body. Some entered me, forming this Tian Dao Foundation Pill after refinement,” he deduced.

“This trial’s initial immortal pills were a decoy. The real test is this pill!” He murmured, eyes serious.

“But this is the one-step-to-greatness opportunity the Star River Mansion’s artifact spirit mentioned. If I refine this Tian Dao Foundation Pill, my strength is unimaginable!” He murmured, carefully observing the pill.

“Such a temptation!” After observing for a while, Lu Tian wore a bitter smile. A chance to strengthen himself was before him, yet he could only watch.

“Damn it, try!” He wore a mad look. He felt the pill contained chaotic energy; if he didn’t act, it might explode, killing him.

“Who created this pill? His elixir art must be extraordinary to infuse immortal qi into it!” Lu Tian marveled, then silently activated his Reincarnation Heaven Art. With a slight refining force, it gently approached the pill.

“Buzz…” The faint refining force touched the pill. A slight ripple spread through the golden Tian Dao Foundation Pill.

Though just a crack, it startled Lu Tian. A terrifying power surged through the crack, sweeping across his dantian.

“Damn it!” Lu Tian cursed, not delaying. His Reincarnation Heaven Art rapidly refined the powerful immortal qi.

Though strong, it struggled to refine so much immortal qi. The qi surged wildly in his body, turning his face red.

“Contain it!” Lu Tian roared. Cold sweat flowed down his face as the wild qi threatened to explode.

“Crack…” In a moment, his newly refined body cracked again.

“Ah, the initial refinement was to prevent me from exploding!” Lu Tian sighed bitterly. The body’s refinement had been crucial.

“Take it slow,” his body stabilized, and he focused on refining the surging immortal qi.

The golden Reincarnation Bridge hummed, as if being assimilated by waves of immortal qi. Lu Tian was overjoyed.

“Awesome…” He felt his dantian undergoing a miraculous transformation—completely foreign to the Nine Domains.

“Maybe I really will leap to greatness, achieving the Tian Dao Realm!” He murmured, sitting beneath the stars.

…

“Buzz…” The hum echoed. Outside Star River Mansion, Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi waited impatiently.

While Lu Tian refined the Tian Dao Foundation Pill, the immortal qi surrounding Star River Mansion began to surge. The mansion erupted in radiant light, golden gates slowly opening as immortal qi was sucked inside.

“Has the trial ended? Where’s Qiu Jingming, that old bastard? Did something happen to Lu Tian?” Their faces showed caution as they gazed at the golden gates.

Immortal qi vanished, and figures emerged from Star River Mansion. Zheng Xin’s face lit up with a smile.

“Finally, you bastard came out!” A curse echoed. The voice was from Diaodezhu. Emerging figures were those who had taken inner and outer disciple exams, including Du Hongxi’s group, who looked at the dazzling stars with confusion.

“This is the three thousand small worlds?” Du Hongxi’s group wore excitement, feeling the stars’ rules.

“I feel my lifespan increased. If possible, I’d live in this small world!” Ma Xiuzhen was also excited, gazing at the beautiful stars.

“Haha, Zheng Xin, you died fast!” Diaodezhu grinned, looking at the first to emerge—Zheng Xin’s group.
