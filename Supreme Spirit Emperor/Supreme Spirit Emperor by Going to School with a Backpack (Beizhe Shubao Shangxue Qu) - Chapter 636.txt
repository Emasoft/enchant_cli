"Knowing it was the guards' excitement or confusion, this transmission had once again gone awry. Plop."

"Thud... Thud..."

The sound of falling into water echoed as Luo Tian and others plunged directly into the Mirage Sea, then suddenly burst forth.

"This transmission is really something else!" Luo Tian dried his soaked body, a bitter smile on his face as he surveyed the surroundings. He saw the distant hazy island and sensed that the spiritual energy was much thinner than in the Central Three Heavens, yet his body gave a slight start.

"Although there was some deviation, it wasn't too far off," Luo Tian murmured, feeling a suppressing force descend upon him as if sealed. It converged toward his dantian.

"Indeed, there's a suppressing force. Within seven days, I'll be suppressed to half-step Immortal King," Luo Tian assessed the pressure, muttering internally.

"Let's go to Heaven Yuan Sect!" Luo Tian addressed Nan Gong Yuqing and others, leaping into the air without entering Mirage Island but heading toward Heaven Yuan Sect.

"We've finally got our own sect!" Nan Gong Yuqing and others were also elated. Though it was merely the Lower Three Heavens, at least there was a hope to gather all nine regions.

Their spiritual power was formidable; so many half-step Immortal Kings could overturn all sects in the Lower Three Heavens. Luo Tian and his group flew swiftly, their excitement guiding them toward their former Shenglong Sect, now Heaven Yuan Sect.

As for the remaining people in Demon Cloud City, Nan Gong Yuqing had arranged them to rebuild it. After all, it belonged to Star River Domain's forces and wasn't theirs. At that moment, Heaven Yuan Sect was surrounded by countless strong figures. Three towering figures stood in the sky, their gazes fixed on Heaven Yuan Sect.

"Hey, Heaven Yuan Sect. Have you decided to disband or be destroyed?" a strong figure spoke, gazing at those on the mountain peak.

"Who gave you the audacity to provoke Heaven Yuan Sect?" Fu Xingyue coldly spoke, his Star Moon Divine Halberd trembling with radiance as he leapt forward to face the three strong figures.

"Haha, what is Heaven Yuan Sect? Everyone knows your intentions—just to vie for the heavens. We know you have an Immortal King, but this is the Lower Three Heavens. Even an Immortal King must lie low. The Heavenly Mandate is in our hands; come and take it!" a middle-aged man spoke, his eyes filled with mockery.

This man was Bai Tianqi, the master of White Moon Sect, one of the three sects that had successfully vied for the heavens after Shenglong Sect. The other two were Ren Dudu of Xuanwu Valley and Zhang Xingyan of the Shadow Mountain Sect. After years of accumulation, all three had reached half-step Immortal King status. Their sects were also formidable, surrounding Heaven Yuan Sect so tightly that no one could escape.

They had been waiting for years to gather information on Heaven Yuan Sect. When they discovered that the sect's leader, Luo Tian, had been missing for decades and only two strong figures remained within the sect, they decided to unite and destroy Heaven Yuan Sect. Indeed, Heaven Yuan Sect's strength surpassed any of the three sects individually and posed a great threat.

"Daydreaming!" Fu Xingyue's face showed disdain. Though there were three of them, Xiang Tianming was an Immortal King. Although restricted by rules to half-step Immortal King, he was still an Immortal King. Together with Fu Xingyue, they were confident in suppressing the three.

"Then we must destroy you!" Ren Dudu's face showed a hint of amusement. Wisps of gray mist rose from his body, enveloping him as he rushed toward Fu Xingyue.

"Kill..." A wave of battle cries erupted instantly, with the three sects' members leaping into action toward Heaven Yuan Sect.

"Brothers, we've finally found a home. Kill!" Most of Heaven Yuan Sect's members were from Starry Realm, fierce and brave. Facing the three sects' forces without fear, they leaped down from Heaven Yuan Mountain to clash with the three sects.

"Have you taken me for a soft target?" Xiang Tianming suddenly appeared, rushing toward Ren Dudu. He opened his mouth and a blue light flashed, revealing a three-pronged spear in his hand.

"Crack..." The gray long sword clashed with the three-pronged spear, producing a thunderous sound. Xiang Tianming and Ren Dudu both retreated slightly, with Xiang Tianming showing a hint of surprise.

Though his cultivation was restricted and the continent further weakened it, he still believed he could suppress a half-step Immortal King. However, Ren Dudu was no weaker than him in their brief clash, which surprised Xiang Tianming.

"Old man, where is your sect's leader?" A cold voice echoed behind Xiang Tianming. Like a ghost, a black dagger split into two glimmers and stabbed toward him.

"Even if the leader isn't here, it's the same!" Xiang Tianming furrowed his brows slightly. He turned his body and clashed with the dagger, sparks flying.

Meanwhile, Fu Xingyue fought against Bai Tianqi. The battlefield turned chaotic as the four major sects of the Lower Three Heavens clashed.

Though the three sects were powerful, their combined numbers were only a few million. In contrast, Starry Realm's people numbered nearly ten million. Even after excluding the weak and women, over eight million remained, outnumbering the three sects. Moreover, Starry Realm's people were fierce; having survived in harsh environments like the three thousand small worlds, their strength was far superior to others of the same level.

Instantly, Heaven Yuan Sect suppressed the three sects, with countless casualties among them. Though Starry Realm's people also suffered losses, they could afford it.

"By this standard, you dare to attack Heaven Yuan Sect? Today, you'll all stay here. I was just wondering how to obtain the Heavenly Mandate; now it's given to me!" Fu Xingyue swung his Star Moon Divine Halberd, repeatedly striking Bai Tianqi while observing the situation.

"Is that so?" Bai Zhengpeng was shocked by Fu Xingyue's strength. Their several confrontations had left him with no advantage, even suffering a minor loss.

As Bai Tianqi's words finished, the back of Heaven Yuan Mountain erupted in chaos. Over a hundred thousand people suddenly surged forward and attacked Heaven Yuan Sect members.

Plop... Plop... The Heaven Yuan Sect's people were unprepared, suffering heavy casualties immediately. Blood flowed down the mountain.

"Da Hu, you..." A disciple gazed at the person who had stabbed a long sword into his chest. He spat blood, eyes filled with disbelief, unable to comprehend why his former brother would suddenly attack him.

"I was forced. I... I'm sorry. If I didn't kill you, it would be me who died!" The disciple's face showed pain before pulling out the sword and rushing toward other Heaven Yuan Sect disciples.

The entire Heaven Yuan Mountain witnessed such scenes, with cries of sorrow echoing. This betrayal by over a hundred thousand people tilted the battlefield, leaving Heaven Yuan Sect's forces caught between two fronts.

It was too sudden. No one expected so many to betray, not even Fu Xingyue. These years, Fu Xingyue had believed he hadn't been lax, managing Heaven Yuan Sect well and treating his subordinates kindly. Yet so many had betrayed him, leaving Fu Xingyue deeply disheartened.

"Plop..." Dazed, Fu Xingyue was struck on the shoulder by Bai Tianqi's sword, blood splattering.

"How about now? Do you still have confidence?" Bai Tianqi smirked, shaking the blood off his sword and gazing at Fu Xingyue before advancing again.

The collision sounds never ceased. Xiang Tianming fought two opponents without falling behind, but seeing Heaven Yuan Sect's heavy casualties made him uneasy. After all, they had spent decades together, and the sect members deeply revered him.

"Damn it. If I were in Mirage Sea, I could sweep them all!" Xiang Tianming's anger surged, his strength increasing involuntarily.

...

At this moment, Luo Tian and others were only a day away from Heaven Yuan Sect. Along the way, they saw many people hurriedly flying into the sky, gazing toward Heaven Yuan Sect.

"I wonder how it turned out. I estimate Heaven Yuan Sect is in trouble this time. It's a pity for such a powerful sect!" Several figures of True Immortal Mid-stage flew toward Heaven Yuan Sect, whispering among themselves.

"Wait... What's happening?" Luo Tian's sharp ears caught their conversation. He expanded his domain, grabbed them with one hand.

"You... You are..." Their faces instantly shocked. They had never encountered such a powerful person who could silently capture them.

"Three sects are attacking Heaven Yuan Sect..." One of them stammered, recounting everything he knew. He felt his life could be destroyed with a single thought.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed anger. He released them and his body sliced through the void, becoming a streak of light that vanished from sight.

"Follow me. I'll go first!" Luo Tian's voice echoed through the heavens, shaking the sky. Everyone could hear the overwhelming killing intent in his voice.

"Who gave you the audacity!" Luo Tian's killing intent surged. If Xiang Tianming hadn't been restricted, he wouldn't have worried. But now that Xiang Tianming's strength was at its peak, Luo Tian felt some concern.

Chapter 2394: Sweep ( )

Luo Tian's heart was filled with anxiety. His speed was fast, but even so, time was needed.

Xiang Tianming had done him a favor. Even before entering the Lower Three Heavens, he hadn't told Luo Tian about being restricted by rules. This made Luo Tian feel deep guilt.

"Surely there's no Immortal King. My current strength is at the early stage of Immortal King, though slightly weakened, it's enough to sweep away any enemy!" Luo Tian muttered internally, pushing his speed to the maximum toward Heaven Yuan Sect.

Time passed. Half a day had elapsed. Luo Tian's speed allowed him to faintly hear the sound of battle cries. So many people fighting, the momentum was unprecedented in the Lower Three Heavens and would be recorded in history.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's face showed anxiety. The thick scent of blood filled his nose, making him more worried.

"Haha..."

"Hey, Heaven Yuan Sect. You're no better than this!" The arrogant laughter echoed above Heaven Yuan Sect as two figures clashed, a black rope coiling around Xiang Tianming's body.

"Roar..." Xiang Tianming roared, his spiritual energy surging as he struggled. He transformed into his true form—a massive Kunpeng bird that obscured the sky, appearing like a dark cloud with overwhelming spiritual energy.

"What kind of creature is this!" Seeing Xiang Tianming's true form, Ren Dudu and Zhang Xingyan showed shock. The fierce spiritual energy on Xiang Tianming terrified them.

Though Xiang Tianming had restored his true form, the black and white rope still coiled around his massive body. It even drew blood, but he couldn't break free.

"What is this!" Xiang Tianming felt alarmed. He sensed the black-gray rope continuously drained his cultivation. If it lasted longer, he might truly be in danger.

"Perfect for my steed!" Ren Dudu's eyes gleamed. He waved his hands, and gray spiritual seals flew from his hands toward Xiang Tianming's massive body.

"Only you?" Xiang Tianming sneered. He opened his mouth, and a massive whirlpool erupted from it. Wind and clouds reversed, an overwhelming suction force that made the world pale and space twist. Zhang Xingyan and Ren Dudu's faces changed, feeling this suction force was extremely powerful, even their bodies trembling.

"Only you two little brats dare to show off before me!" Xiang Tianming's powerful voice echoed through the heavens. Though his strength was weakened to its peak, he remained强势.

"Crash..." A torrent of water from the nine heavens poured down. Wind and clouds changed, a powerful column of water erupted from Xiang Tianming's mouth toward Ren Dudu. At that moment, Ren Dudu was countering the powerful suction force. When the suction suddenly disappeared, he was stunned and directly hit by the powerful column of water, collapsing space and taking his body away into the horizon.

"This..." Zhang Xingyan's face showed shock, watching Ren Dudu disappear. A sense of fear arose in his heart.

"After all, he was once an Immortal King!" Zhang Xingyan sighed internally. His body retreated; alone, he couldn't match Xiang Tianming. He could only wait for Ren Dudu's return.

"Let me break free!" Xiang Tianming ignored the retreating Zhang Xingyan and fiercely attacked the black-gray rope.

Fu Xingyue continued to fight Bai Tianqi without falling behind, even having some advantages. However, he couldn't defeat Bai Tianqi immediately. Bai Tianqi wasn't in a hurry, continuously attacking because the lower disciples' battle gave them an advantage. If they slaughtered all the disciples, victory would be theirs.

The entire Heaven Yuan Mountain was blood-soaked. Bloodwater even spread outward, now covering ten thousand miles. Corpses lay everywhere.

"Damn it!" Fu Xingyue muttered internally, his anxiety deep. After half a day of battle, Heaven Yuan Sect had suffered heavy losses. Though no exact statistics were made, seeing the original large groups now reduced to over six-tenths was a rough estimate.

"Buzz..." As Fu Xingyue's anxiety deepened, the void tore open. A streak of gray light suddenly appeared behind him and slashed down.

This slash was extremely sudden, even Fu Xingyue couldn't react in time. He was directly struck on the back by the gray long sword, almost splitting him in two. This strike severely wounded Fu Xingyue.

"Ren Dudu!" Fu Xingyue's pale face showed blood gushing from his back. No one expected Ren Dudu to return so quickly and strike Fu Xingyue with a surprise attack, severely wounding him.

"Damn it!" Fu Xingyue gripped his Star Moon Divine Halberd, his whole body filled with bloodlust. The halberd trembled as he gazed at Ren Dudu and Bai Tianqi.

"Kill!" Bai Tianqi's body moved like lightning, becoming a streak of white light and rushing toward Fu Xingyue with a sword strike.

"Crack..." Sparks flew as they merely passed each other. Fu Xingyue's shoulder had a deep wound.

"It's getting tough!" Fu Xingyue muttered internally. This Ren Dudu was very strong; surviving Xiang Tianming's full-force attack proved his strength.

"Today, you must die!" Bai Tianqi laughed and flew forward again toward Fu Xingyue.

At the moment Bai Tianqi moved, Luo Tian finally arrived. Seeing Fu Xingyue covered in blood, his killing intent could no longer be restrained. He let out a roar.

"Stop!" Luo Tian roared, his body moving at maximum speed. As he flew, a gray domain of ten thousand souls howled down, appearing beside Fu Xingyue. He reached out with one hand to grab the white streak of light attacking Fu Xingyue.

"Crinkle..." A piercing sound echoed. Luo Tian grabbed Bai Tianqi's sword with one hand, and no blood was spilled.

"You should die!" Luo Tian gazed at Bai Tianqi holding the sword, his cold eyes making Bai Tianqi's body tremble involuntarily.

"Die..." Luo Tian clenched his hand, and Bai Tianqi's body twisted as if under invisible pressure. Even the golden sword was shattered in Luo Tian's sight.

"This..." Everyone only realized when Bai Tianqi died. They gazed at Luo Tian, who was filled with killing intent beside Fu Xingyue.

"Luo Tian!" Fu Xingyue's eyes showed joy. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to return at this time.

"Good, not too late!" Luo Tian muttered softly. He gazed at Ren Dudu standing in the distance and Zhang Xingyan still fighting with Xiang Tianming.

"Luo Tian!" Ren Dudu's body retreated, his eyes filled with shock. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to return.

"Immortal King!" Zhang Xingyan's eyes showed fear, gazing at Luo Tian. He felt the overwhelming spiritual energy from Luo Tian and spoke out in shock.

"Finally returned!" Xiang Tianming's body moved slightly, reverting to human form and panting heavily.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He gazed at the place where Bai Tianqi had exploded, finding a black stone-like object falling from the blood mist.

"Demonic Seed!" Luo Tian whispered, grabbing toward the black demonic seed.

"Buzz..." Just as Luo Tian was about to grasp the demonic seed, it emitted a buzzing sound. An incredible fluctuation spread across the demonic seed, making Luo Tian's face slightly change.

"Boom..." The next moment, the black demonic seed exploded. A violent fluctuation instantly surged toward Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

"Suppress!" Luo Tian slapped his hand, compressing domain power to suppress the fluctuation capable of destroying a half-step Immortal King.

"Power equivalent to a half-step Immortal King's explosion!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed like lightning, gazing at Zhang Xingyan and Ren Dudu.

Clearly, one of these two had cultivated the "Seeding the Heart with Demon" technique. The demon stone on Guan Hongsheng's body must also be among these two.

"Run!" Ren Dudu and Zhang Xingyan didn't hesitate, fleeing toward the distance. An early-stage Immortal King was beyond their strength.

"Can you escape?" Luo Tian sneered, his body moving to block their path. He extended a black hand toward Ren Dudu and Zhang Xingyan, while Xiang Tianming and Fu Xingyue landed on Heaven Yuan Mountain to organize the sect's people against the three sects.

The addition of two half-step Immortal Kings, especially leaders, greatly boosted Heaven Yuan Sect's morale.

"Boom..." A massive black hand obscured the sky, making Ren Dudu and Zhang Xingyan's faces change drastically.

"Luo Tian, don't force me!" Ren Dudu roared, retreating and grabbing Zhang Xingyan, who was stunned by Luo Tian's aura. He stood in front of himself.

"Boom..." Blood mist rose, Zhang Xingyan's body was directly smashed by Luo Tian's palm and disintegrated in front of Ren Dudu. Ren Dudu also spat blood, his body flying back again.

But Ren Dudu immediately grabbed a black light from Zhang Xingyan's blood mist, which landed beside him—this was the black demonic seed.

"Looks like it's you. I've been looking for you. Unexpectedly, you've come to me!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, taking another step toward Ren Dudu.

"Crack..." Ren Dudu's face showed madness. He bit down, crushing the black demonic seed and swallowing it into his mouth. At the same time, the gray aura around Ren Dudu gradually changed to black demonic energy.

"Come out!" Ren Dudu roared, his hands forming a seal. He slammed his hands into the void.

"Boom... Boom..." As Ren Dudu roared, the people from the three sects attacking Heaven Yuan Mountain instantly exploded. Countless demonic seeds flew out, forming a black dragon that rushed toward Luo Tian and collided with his hand again.

Chapter 2395: Cultivating the Demon Energy ( )

Boom... Boom...

Countless black crystal-like objects shattered under Luo Tian's crushing hand. The sky above seemed to burst fireworks, though the power was massive and cracked the heavens.

The black hand crushed countless demonic seeds but remained overwhelming, crushing Ren Dudu's body.

"Puke..." Ren Dudu spat blood, his body flying back without hesitation. He fled toward the distance, eyes filled with fear.

"Seeding the Heart with Demon! How could the sect leader have this!" The strong figures of Xuanwu Valley showed shock, gazing at the shattered demonic seeds.

"Ah! That's why the sect leader reached this level in just a century. He must have cultivated Seeding the Heart with Demon!" The people of Xuanwu Valley immediately understood.

Ren Dudu was a legend in Xuanwu Valley. In just a century, he became a half-step Immortal King and led the originally weak Xuanwu Valley to become one of the three major sects in the Lower Three Heavens. Many people in Xuanwu Valley regarded Ren Dudu as a faith.

"It's not just that. The other two sects' leaders were also seeded with demonic seeds by the leader. That means they are under the leader's control!" People then realized that after Bai Tianqi and Zhang Xingyan died, demonic seeds erupted.

Most people from the three sects, including those who betrayed Heaven Yuan Sect, showed bitterness. These people had all been seeded with Seeding the Heart with Demon.

When Ren Dudu resisted Luo Tian's hand, it took over ten thousand demonic seeds to resist. No one knew if the next would be them.

Countless demonic seeds shattered, forming a vast sea of demonic energy that enveloped the sky.

"Damn it!" Ren Dudu's face was grim. He watched Luo Tian's hand crushing down again and opened his mouth to suck in the swirling demonic energy.

"Boom... Boom..." Each body exploded instantly, black crystal-like objects flying up again to form a dragon that rushed toward Luo Tian's hand. This time, thirty thousand.

"Trivial tricks!" Luo Tian sneered and struck with one hand while his other hands moved. Roars echoed in the heavens, a massive black creature roaring down to crush Ren Dudu.

"Come out!" At this moment, Ren Dudu was tens of thousands of zhang away from Luo Tian. He knew he couldn't escape now.

Explosions echoed on Heaven Yuan Mountain, as countless people from the three sects and Heaven Yuan Sect's traitors exploded instantly.

Countless black crystal-like objects rose, varying in size and densely packed, making people's skin crawl.

"This... so many..." No one expected Ren Dudu to have seeded these people with demonic seeds. They gasped in shock, and within moments, millions of lives vanished, an震撼 scene that left everyone terrified.

"Ah! That's why they betrayed Heaven Yuan Sect!" The people of Heaven Yuan Sect immediately understood. They hadn't expected Ren Dudu to infiltrate so deeply in just a few decades, accurately speaking, it was the terrifying power of Seeding the Heart with Demon.

The black demonic seeds formed a monstrous beast, roaring and colliding with Luo Tian's crushing hand.

Boom... Boom...

In an instant, the collision sound echoed. The beast formed by demonic seeds was shattered by the hellish claw, countless demonic seeds transforming into demonic energy that rolled endlessly.

"Roar..." The remaining demonic seeds凝聚 again, forming a beast's shape and rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Excellent!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration. Guan Hongsheng had only known to absorb demonic seeds to enhance his cultivation, but Ren Dudu knew how to use them for attacks and even control their self-explosions.

Luo Tian's Black Dragon Sword was in his hand. He extended a hand to slash, the sword's light flashing and instantly shattering the beast again. His body moved toward Ren Dudu, who was devouring demonic energy.

"Almost there... almost there!" Ren Dudu's heart was anxious. He watched Luo Tian rushing toward him. At this moment, his spiritual energy surged, and he was about to reach the early stage of Immortal King. Once he absorbed all the demonic energy, Ren Dudu would briefly enter the early stage of Immortal King. Then he could fight Luo Tian.

But Luo Tian wouldn't give Ren Dudu this chance. He instantly arrived at Ren Dudu's side and swung his Dragon Sword toward him.

"Go..." Ren Dudu quickly stopped absorbing demonic energy, his body retreating. However, he was cut off by Luo Tian's sword, losing an arm. Blood spewed from Ren Dudu's shoulder, and his entire body retreated thirty thousand zhang away, pale-faced.

"Run!" Ren Dudu began to burn his cultivation and blood, exploding his speed to the maximum. At this moment, he only wanted to escape.

"Can you escape?" Luo Tian sneered, his feet stepping on the Yellow Spring Steps toward Ren Dudu's direction. However, as Luo Tian took a step, his face showed a smile and he stopped, gazing at the direction Ren Dudu fled.

"No pursuit!" Ren Dudu's heart rejoiced. He roared, "Luo Tian! I'll avenge this grudge someday. When your cultivation is suppressed to half-step Immortal King, I'll come to your Heaven Yuan Sect!"

"Ah..." But before Ren Dudu's words finished, his mouth let out a scream. A streak of purple lightning struck his body, making his face twist.

"Where are you running?" A playful voice echoed. Several figures surrounded Ren Dudu, and the one attacking him was Diao Dezhu.

"You..." Ren Dudu gazed at Nan Gong Yuqing and others, momentarily stunned. Luo Tian also appeared before Ren Dudu. The three surrounded him. Not even when Luo Tian was a half-step Immortal King could he escape such an arrangement.

"We don't need captives. If you want to attack Heaven Yuan Sect, prepare to pay with blood!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed through the heavens. He transformed into a meat grinder, descending upon the three sects' people. Wherever his domain encompassed, many died.

The people of Heaven Yuan Sect were shocked by Luo Tian's iron blood and felt reverence. The scene of Luo Tian killing the three sect leaders also boosted Heaven Yuan Sect's morale.

Despair arose in the three sects' disciples, but they felt deep helplessness. In a day's time, all the three sects' disciples were wiped out without leaving a single survivor.

"Kill!" After this battle, Heaven Yuan Sect was finally established in the Lower Three Heavens with overwhelming power. Using hundreds of thousands of lives from the three sects as a sacrifice, it made the entire Lower Three Heavens tremble.

"The three sects have been destroyed!" People watching from afar at Heaven Yuan Sect were astonished. They hadn't expected such a result.

"Luo Tian, the sect leader of Heaven Yuan Sect, has Immortal King cultivation and brought back several half-step Immortal Kings. Which sect in the Lower Three Heavens could match this?"

"During Shenglong Sect's time, it was said to be the strongest sect in the Lower Three Heavens since vying for the heavens. How long has it been? Heaven Yuan Sect broke Shenglong Sect's history and even crushed it, with strength several times that of the former Shenglong Sect!" People's eyes showed admiration. They imagined Heaven Yuan Sect's rise to power in the Lower Three Heavens.

"Respect the sect leader!" All of Heaven Yuan Sect's disciples bowed to Luo Tian, eyes filled with respect.

"Everyone has worked hard. I'm back!" Luo Tian softly sighed, his eyes full of regret. He had been away for so long and missed the sect's opening ceremony, which indeed made Heaven Yuan Sect lose face.

"Everyone in Heaven Yuan Sect will receive a great reward!" Luo Tian gazed at the thick demonic energy in the sky. He waved his hands, nine-color flames flying from his hands. The roaring sea of nine-color fire, under the people's shock, wrapped around the thick demonic energy.

Black mist rose. The thick demonic energy was purified by the nine-color flames, leaving pure cultivation power that transformed into raindrops falling from the sky.

"This is!" Heaven Yuan Sect's people showed joy. They quickly sat cross-legged on the mountain, beginning to refine the raindrops that fell upon them.

One hour... Two hours... Luo Tian refined for three hours, finally completing the demonic energy. His body felt weak but his eyes showed a smile.

A roaring sound echoed on Heaven Yuan Mountain. After the battle and Luo Tian's refinement of the cultivation power for everyone, many people quickly enhanced their strength.

"You really are generous!" Xiang Tianming smiled lightly. He knew if Luo Tian had absorbed the demonic energy, he wouldn't be far from Immortal King Mid-stage.

Chapter 2396: New Sect Leader ( )

"Respect the sect leader!" A sea of voices echoed, Heaven Yuan Sect's people showing respect and gazing at Luo Tian in the sky.

After this battle, Heaven Yuan Sect suffered heavy losses but stood firm. It strengthened their unity and fully adapted to the rules of the Immortal World.

From now on, there were no longer three sects in the Lower Three Heavens but only Heaven Yuan Sect.

"Alright, everyone go and repair Heaven Yuan Sect!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, addressing the people. He knew from now on, there were no more Starry Realm people in their hearts—only Heaven Yuan Sect.

Heaven Yuan Sect's name was completely known throughout the Lower Three Heavens. Everyone in the Lower Three Heavens discussed Heaven Yuan Sect's deeds and power.

Emerging from nowhere, staying quietly in the Lower Three Heavens for decades, it suddenly made a stunning appearance by destroying the three sects that attacked. Luo Tian, this name long dormant in the Lower Three Heavens, reappeared again. The last time he was discussed so much by the Lower Three Heavens was during Shenglong Sect's disciple. Now, he was at the peak of Heaven Yuan Sect.

This incident even reached the Central Three Heavens, making the sects there nervous. After all, in ten years it would be the vying for the heavens. One of them must fight against Heaven Yuan Sect.

After a month's rest, Heaven Yuan Sect returned to normal. This month, Luo Tian and others were busy.

"My god, I really don't want to be the sect leader!" Luo Tian collapsed on his bed, looking exhausted. He hadn't rested for a month, and this trip had drained him greatly.

"From today on, I'll pass the sect leadership to Nan Gong Yuqing!" Luo Tian's authoritative voice echoed across Heaven Yuan Mountain, making everyone slightly shocked.

"What's going on? So quickly changing the sect leader. Nan Gong Elder is also good!" Heaven Yuan Sect's disciples whispered among themselves, not too concerned. These days, Nan Gong Yuqing had fully integrated into Heaven Yuan Sect and held considerable authority.

"Your father!" Nan Gong Yuqing cursed, holding a knife and coming to Luo Tian's residence. He had just gotten some peace, but now Luo Tian was giving him the sect leadership. How could he accept it?

"Luo Tian, I just got some peace. These years I've managed Demon Cloud City and also managed the demons. Can't you let me rest?" Nan Gong Yuqing's curses echoed in Luo Tian's courtyard.

"You're capable. This is the way of the strong!" Luo Tian shouted back.

"Rubbish, I don't want to be..."

"No way out. I've already announced it!"

After a quarrel, Nan Gong Yuqing's face showed satisfaction as he left Luo Tian's courtyard.

"By the way, the previous transfer was a joke between me and Nan Gong Elder. Don't take it seriously. I intended to pass the sect leadership to Fu Xingyue, your former prince..." Luo Tian's awkward voice echoed, making Heaven Yuan Sect's people slightly stunned.

"Luo Tian, I'm your brother! You can't betray me!" Fu Xingyue's cry echoed from his residence. He rushed toward Luo Tian's residence.

After an hour, Fu Xingyue came out, his eyes filled with triumph. He looked at the door he had kicked down and returned to his home.

"Damn it, if not for Xingxuan's sake, I'd definitely fight with you!" Luo Tian looked at his house almost destroyed by Fu Xingyue, thinking.

"Who to pass it to?" Luo Tian muttered internally. This time he decided not to be so hasty. After thinking, his eyes lit up.

"Ah! It was just me and Fu Xingyue getting drunk, it was a drunken speech. Actually, I intended to pass the leadership to Long Jie!" Luo Tian's voice echoed again, making Heaven Yuan Sect's people stunned.

"Master, are you playing around?" Heaven Yuan Sect's people had twitching mouths. In such a short time, they had already transferred twice.

"Wow, our speed of changing sect leaders is the fastest!" People whispered among themselves, somewhat speechless.

"Big brother..." Long Jie cried out and flew into Luo Tian's residence.

"Big brother, you can't trick me like this. You can let anyone be the leader!" Long Jie glared at Luo Tian.
