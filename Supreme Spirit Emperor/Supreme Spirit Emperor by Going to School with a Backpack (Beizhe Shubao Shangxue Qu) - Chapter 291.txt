Luo Tian had always been an invincible figure in their hearts, there was nothing he could not accomplish. Yet people had forgotten that Luo Tian was also human, and like all humans, he too would die.

The strike had cast a heavy sorrow over the entire Ancient Heaven Palace. People sighed endlessly in their hearts, for the extinction of the soul lamp signified something they all understood.

"Good, prepare for the next battle! The thundering of the Four Sacred Star Domains has completely vanished. Since Luo Tian is dead, it's likely that the elders of all the Holy Sects have failed. Thus, what follows is Ming Domain's blood sacrifice across nine domains." Luo Xiong coughed up two mouthfuls of black blood, his eyes deep and solemn as he gazed into the distance. His aged body trembled as he addressed the people of two domains.

"Yes!" All those in the grand hall roared with bloodshot eyes, their killing intent surging and colliding against the walls of the Ancient Heaven Palace, producing a continuous humming sound that merged with their low growls.

"Master has also perished!" The spirit of the artifact, Meng Lingxiao, was filled with killing intent. His voice carried an icy chill, causing the Ancient Heaven Palace to radiate brilliant light.

Figures moved swiftly. The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Fire Domain flew out from the Ancient Heaven Palace, gathering together.

On another side, the blood mist formed by Luo Tian descended upon the crimson array. His bloodline power dispersed, finally halting the array's operation.

"Luo Tian!" Diao Yuanshan gazed at the now-stilled array, standing motionless with a vacant expression, whispering lowly.

"I swear by my ancestor Shengtian that as long as I remain in the Divine Clan, the Divine Clan shall never set foot in the Four Sacred Star Domains or Fire Domain!" Shengtian's eyes carried admiration, his voice filled with gratitude.

"A hum..." The golden Age Book emerged from the array, appearing beneath the stars. It radiated radiant gold light before vanishing into their sight, disappearing into unknown places.

"Seal this place!" Shengtian ordered Diao Yuanshan, gazing at the array that had stopped. The Age Treasure, the Blood-Refining Vessel, entered the Ming God Palace at the moment the array ceased.

"Ah!" Diao Yuanshan nodded slightly. A vast flow of purple qi emerged from his hands, enveloping the entire Ming God Palace.

Shengtian also radiated brilliant light. Golden seals merged into the vast purple qi, and with Diao Yuanshan's cooperation, they enveloped the Ming God Palace. Now, among all nine domains, only their cultivation levels were highest—Age Initial Stage. To break through their combined seal would be impossible for anyone.

"I must return to the Divine Clan. Once back, I'll spread this news. I'm going into seclusion now. That Ming Zhenyan has suffered heavy damage, but he's disappeared somewhere. Clearly a big trouble. If he recovers, there might be unexpected changes!" Shengtian bowed to Diao Yuanshan.

"Ah, I need to go to the Fire Domain and deliver this news," Diao Yuanshan said. He collected Luo Tian's remaining Broken Sky Spear and Yin Fish, his face showing a bitter expression. He didn't know how to face the people of two domains.

Chapter 1213: Rebirth Through轮回

In the Four Sacred Star Domains, on the Cliff of Severing Gods, the Soul-Eating Beast lazily lay upon the altar. Its eyes were lifeless, emitting a long sigh. The entire Four Sacred Star Domains had been completely annihilated before, but only the Cliff of Severing Gods remained untouched.

Yet the Soul-Eating Beast had felt those intense tremors, lamenting the intensity of the battle. However, being naturally cold-hearted, it didn't intervene. Its task was to protect Zhongli Tian's physical body and await the return of the Master of the Melody.

"A hum..." The humming echoed. A withered body appeared upon the altar—this was the previous puppet.

And on its back, Zhongli Tian's golden radiance body had descended onto the altar. His eyes showed respect as he placed Zhongli Tian's physical body beside the Soul-Eating Beast.

"Back already?" The Soul-Eating Beast's massive eyes showed a hint of joy. It examined Zhongli Tian's physical body, then its massive eyes displayed confusion.

"A hum..." At that moment of confusion, golden light flickered. A thread of gold descended from the sky, causing the Soul-Eating Beast's eyes to burst with radiant light.

"The Age Book!" The Soul-Eating Beast saw the source of the golden radiance through the light. Its large eyes were filled with shock.

Having followed Zhongli Tian and the Master of the Melody, the Soul-Eating Beast naturally knew about the Age Book. Back then, Zhongli Tian had forcibly implanted the Age Book into the Master of the Melody's body, thus enabling her to become the Age Master.

"How come it's here? Did the master truly revive?" The Soul-Eating Beast stared anxiously at the Age Book and Zhongli Tian's physical body, fearing any mishap.

"Flap-flap..." The golden Age Book fluttered in the sky, emitting waves that descended upon Zhongli Tian's physical body.

Under the Soul-Eating Beast's anxious gaze, Zhongli Tian's physical body also radiated golden light, echoing the Age Book.

"Is it really going to revive?" The Soul-Eating Beast's face showed excitement. It felt waves of energy from Zhongli Tian's physical body, causing its massive body to tremble.

Under the Soul-Eating Beast's excited gaze, wisps of gray mist emerged from Zhongli Tian's physical body. Though few, like strands of hair, they were forcibly extracted by the Age Book and appeared before the Soul-Eating Beast's sight.

"What is this?" The Soul-Eating Beast's eyes were puzzled. It saw the faint gray mist, and since it was named Soul-Eating Beast, it was extremely sensitive to soul energy. At the moment those wisps of gray mist appeared, it had already sensed their soul essence.

"A familiar feeling... but not quite like the master's soul. Could it be Luo Tian's? That kid is dead?" The Soul-Eating Beast widened its eyes, showing a look of disbelief.

"Reincarnated bodies are those with great fortune. And yet he's dead!" The Soul-Eating Beast whispered in surprise, gazing at those wisps of gray mist.

"Only such a small amount of soul energy remains. No one can save him!" The Soul-Eating Beast looked at the barely existent soul energy under the Age Book's technique, clearly residual within Zhongli Tian's body.

Time slowly passed. Under the Soul-Eating Beast's gaze, Luo Tian's soul energy remaining in Zhongli Tian's body was finally completely extracted. Yet it had no human form at all.

"Flap-flap..." Then, the Age Book fluttered again. A golden light flickered, and a golden scroll separated from the Age Book, instantly appearing beside the Soul-Eating Beast.

"Pu..." Blood splattered. The Soul-Eating Beast didn't react in time, and its entire body had a chunk of flesh sliced off. It screamed in pain.

"Your mother! You've followed my two masters, we're acquaintances. How could you do this to me!" The Soul-Eating Beast cursed loudly, its eyes filled with resentment. It dared not resist the Age Book, knowing its terrifying power.

In the past, when the Age Master Miaoyin had become an Age Master, she had attempted to refine the Age Book but failed. She had sighed that the Age Book was not meant for the nine domains.

The Age Book ignored the Soul-Eating Beast's resentment. Its ultimate refining power instantly refined the Soul-Eating Beast's flesh, extracting wisps of gray mist from it. Finally, these wisps merged with Luo Tian's residual soul.

A grey figure coalesced within the radiant light. Its eyes were closed, hovering in the sky. The Soul-Eating Beast was shocked to see that this grey figure was none other than Luo Tian.

"Wow! Amazing!" The Soul-Eating Beast's eyes showed intense disbelief. It hadn't expected the Age Book to be so miraculous.

"Big brother, we're acquaintances. I have a fragment of the master's soul here. Please help me revive him, even if you kill me!" The Soul-Eating Beast shouted loudly, his voice shaking the entire Cliff of Severing Gods.

But no matter how hard the Soul-Eating Beast called, the Age Book seemed deaf. It emitted a humming sound. A piece of bitter wood emerged from the Age Book, enveloping it in golden light.

"An immortal herb's fragrance. But it's about to die. Regrettable!" The Soul-Eating Beast saw the Age Book acting like a master, ignoring him completely. His eyes showed disappointment. While restoring his massive body, he continued observing the Age Book's movements, feeling it was becoming more and more incomprehensible.

Light of dawn fell. The withered trunk was the immortal tree that had been destroyed by Meng Lingyun to block Ming Haoyan's attack. It was unknown why the Age Book had brought it here.

The withered trunk bathed in golden light, as if watered by a spring. What had been just a faint spark of life now began to slowly revive.

"God damn it, amazing!" The Soul-Eating Beast's mouth twitched as he watched the life spreading across the withered trunk. He spoke involuntarily.

A tiny sprout slowly grew from the withered trunk, though small, it seemed to hold infinite potential and vitality.

Golden light flared again. Golden lines were carved onto the withered tree, peeling off its bark like a metamorphosis. It radiated waves of radiant light.

The Soul-Eating Beast's eyes were fixed on this miraculous scene. This was the first time in its long years that it had seen such a spectacle. It wanted to know what transformation the immortal tree would undergo.

While the Age Book continued carving onto the immortal tree, in the Fire Domain, golden palaces floated above Tongtian Mountain. A group of figures with bloodshot eyes and overwhelming killing intent waited for the nine saints of Ming Domain, determined to fight to the death.

However, they waited for a long time but did not see Ming Domain's nine saints. Instead, they saw an old man wrapped in purple qi—Diao Yuanshan, who had just returned from Ming Domain.

"Everyone, the chaos of Ming Domain has been resolved!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes carried sorrow as he addressed the people of two domains.

"Flap-flap..." A wave of murmurs arose. The people of the two domains immediately started discussing, surprised that they had actually won.

"Where... where is Luo Tian?" Luo Xiong's aged body trembled. His eyes looked at Diao Yuanshan, and after his excitement, he thought of his grandson.

"Luo Tian... to resist Ming Domain's array, he self-destructed. He used his blood and bones to suppress Ming Domain's array!" Diao Yuanshan's face was red. He had no face to meet the people of two domains, having gone with Luo Tian to battle but returning alone. The one who had died was his junior.

"Ah..." The people of the two domains went mad, crying out in pain. Their eyes burst with hatred, a sense of helplessness rising within them.

Diao Yuanshan's eyes were also filled with deep sorrow. He recounted the entire process to them, telling of how Luo Tian had finally entered the Age Peak's reincarnated body and killed Ming Haoyan, then self-destructed to suppress the array.

"Unquestionably my Luo family's descendant!" Luo Xiong looked older, his voice weary but his gaze toward Ming Domain.

"He won't die. I don't believe Luo Tian has died. How could he abandon us!" Gu Qianxue's long hair fluttered, her eyes filled with determination as she shouted.

Jiang Sixi, Sun Mengru, and Leng Qiuchan stood behind Gu Qianxue. Their eyes showed determination—Luo Tian would not die.

"I won't let my father die!" Luo Li's small face showed a determined expression, appearing beside the four women. His voice was childish.

"Brother, he's not dead!" Long Jie spoke, his voice unusually determined. He looked at the dimming Dragon Mark on his arm.

Hearing Long Jie and Luo Li's words, people's faces slightly changed. Long Jie had been a companion with Luo Tian and shared a special connection, while Luo Li was Luo Tian's bloodline. Both were closely connected to Luo Tian. Their words naturally made people doubtful.

"I'm not crazy. I truly feel that Luo Tian hasn't died!" Gu Qianxue, hearing Long Jie and Luo Li's words, was more convinced of her feelings.

"Yes, we also have the same feeling. Perhaps there really is a miracle!" The three women nodded firmly, encouraging each other.

Diao Yuanshan sighed bitterly. He had personally seen Luo Tian's death. Who knew the truth better than him? He sighed inwardly, thinking: "Let them have some hope."

Diao Yuanshan didn't refute their words. He scanned the crowd with his eyes, then bowed to Luo Xiong: "I'll take Elder Long back to the Beast Domain first. The Four Sacred Star Domains are completely gone. If you return, you'll need to rebuild!"

"Ah, we won't keep you long," Luo Xiong bowed slightly. He watched Diao Yuanshan leave, then addressed the crowd: "Let's go home!"

Chapter 1214: The Wild Continent

In the nine domains, all the Holy Sects and Clans were anxiously waiting for Ming Domain's attack. But after a full day, they didn't see the expected nine saints of Ming Domain.

Then news spread from the Beast Domain and Divine Beasts Domain that Diao Yuanshan and Shengtian had returned. Upon returning to the Divine Clan, Shengtian immediately announced that Ming Domain's chaos had ended. The news spread and the entire nine domains trembled.

All cultivators in the nine domains cheered, feeling relief after surviving. Joy spread everywhere.

However, the major sects and clans were not happy. Although their strength was still the strongest among the nine domains, the complete loss of their resources made them deeply regretful.

Another major news also spread throughout the nine domains. Luo Tian, a prodigy of his generation, had shown astonishing abilities and strength during this chaos.

He had entered the Age Peak's reincarnated body, cooperating with the Age Master Meng Lingyun to kill Ming Domain's leader, Ming Haoyan. Finally, he self-destructed his body and burned his soul to block the array's operation.

Countless people felt regret. Such a prodigy had died, an invincible person who ultimately sacrificed for the nine domains.

Yet people lamented while many also sighed in relief. Luo Tian was too invincible, pressing the younger generation to breathe hard. Without Luo Tian, other prodigies in the nine domains could compete again.

"Regardless, Luo Tian is a hero of the nine domains!"

"Yes. In my heart, no one who has defeated Luo Tian can be considered the top prodigy!" Everyone started discussing.

"Did he really die? I guess I'll be lonely now!" On the divine mountain of the Divine Clan, Sun Miechen's eyes flickered as he spoke softly.

"Regrettable. I never expected that on the path of future enlightenment, there would be no more you," Yan Hongtao from the Revenant Domain said solemnly, lifting a cup of wine and pouring it into the void.

"Like a meteor, brilliant but didn't reach the end. Farewell, Luo Brother!" In Starry Domain, people gazed at the stars, watching a meteor streak across the sky and whispered lowly.

"Perhaps my only regret is not having fought you," in the Chaos Domain, two people sat there. One sighed softly.

"Big brother, without a rival on the future path, you will surely attain enlightenment!" Zhu Gehuangchao said softly, his eyes showing respect.

The entire nine domains mourned Luo Tian's death. His deeds became a monument for the nine domains, recorded by major sects and clans. Such a prodigy was even more miraculous than the Age Master in his youth.

While people mourned Luo Tian's death, a group of people from the Four Sacred Star Domains appeared under its starry sky. They gazed at their destroyed domain, eyes filled with sorrow.

"The Four Sacred Star Domains are unsuitable for human habitation," Luo Xiong sighed longingly, speaking softly. Before him, the Four Sacred Star Domains were gray and lifeless. There was no blackness, no stars, no land—only space turbulence. Not only ordinary people but even those with slightly lower cultivation could not survive, and the energy was so thin it was unfit for cultivation.

"There's no way to rebuild," everyone shook their heads gently. They looked at the devastated Four Sacred Star Domains, seeing no hope of rebuilding. The entire starry sky was gone; it wasn't clear how long until it could fully recover.

"Let's go back to the Fire Domain," Luo Xiong and others shook their heads. The Four Sacred Star Domains were completely gone, leaving them no choice but to return to the Fire Domain.

"Luo Brother, don't rush. The Starry Domain has come to help you rebuild the domain!" As the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains turned around, figures appeared. Zhou Tianxing from the Starry Domain, with a sigh on his face, appeared in their sight.

"Did we come too late?" A cold voice echoed. Yan Xiuluo from the Revenant Domain also arrived with his warriors.

"I'll help rebuild the Four Sacred Star Domains!" The Chaos Domain also joined, and the Demon Clan would assist in rebuilding. "The Luo Chen Family has come to help the Four Sacred Star Domains."

Numerous figures appeared in the sight of the people from the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Luo Xiong's face showed excitement. He looked at those figures, knowing they had come for the favor of Luo Tian's battle against Ming Haoyan. Yet he couldn't feel happy—it was his grandson who had sacrificed his life for it.

"Let's start!" Zhou Tianxing from the Starry Domain led his people. With hands moving, powerful waves spread among them. Star energy filled the air as a massive star was formed by the combined efforts of the Starry Domain's people and pushed into the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Meanwhile, the Chaos Domain's people continuously channeled their gray holy energy to restore the starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Other domain's warriors also worked together, waves of power spreading. The Four Sacred Star Domains were slowly being restored by the combined efforts of several domains, although it wasn't clear how long it would take. Still, it gave the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains a glimmer of hope.

While people were rebuilding the Four Sacred Star Domains, on the Cliff of Severing Gods, golden light flickered. The Soul-Eating Beast's eyes showed disbelief as it watched the intense golden light beneath the Age Book.

"Miracle! This is a miracle!" The Soul-Eating Beast growled lowly, its heart overwhelmed with shock.

In its sight, the immortal tree was transformed into a human form under the Age Book's carving. It bathed in golden radiant light.

"Luo Tian!" The Soul-Eating Beast saw Luo Tian's form on that body. Additionally, the gray soul was integrated into that body by the Age Book.

"Flap-flap..." The next moment, the Age Book rushed into the newly formed body of Luo Tian and floated above the altar.

"Living energy! He's truly alive!" The Soul-Eating Beast roared. After the soul and body merged, it felt a faint life force on that body.

But before the Soul-Eating Beast could recover from its shock, that body suddenly plummeted. It fell toward the altar without any resistance, plunging into it.

"Can't! That's the entrance to the Tenth Domain of Origin!" The Soul-Eating Beast shouted, knowing what lay beneath the altar.

"Ah?" However, to the Soul-Eating Beast's surprise, after the body fell in, there was no reaction. It seemed as if nothing had happened.

"Truly..." The Soul-Eating Beast was speechless. What it had seen today exceeded its comprehension.

"Tenth Domain! I wonder if Luo Tian truly survives!" The Soul-Eating Beast sighed deeply, shaking its head. Seeing no changes in the altar, it lay back down beside Zhongli Tian, and the altar returned to calm.

...

A desolate land. A fierce sun radiated intense heat, shining upon the ground. A massive body stood on the land, producing a deep sound with each step. Its height was about three zhang, more than double the size of an average human.

The蛮族 (Beast Clan), one of the ancient tribes, had a simple nature but an extremely strong physical body. Even among the royal clans, few could match it in close combat.

The Tenth Domain had been completely sealed by the Master of Cutting Heaven, and since then it had been isolated from the nine domains.

The number of ancient tribes was far greater than that of humans. With so many people living in one domain, conflicts were inevitable. However, the royal clans remained at the top, with pure bloodlines and especially those with royal bloodlines holding high status.

The Wild Continent was the territory of one of these royal clans, the蛮族 (Beast Clan). Over time, the蛮族 (Beast Clan) had lived on this harsh Wild Continent.

South Ridge, a common mountain range in the Wild Continent. A massive Beast Clan giant walked across the ordinary land. His eyes gazed at the dragons circling in the sky, then he smiled broadly and took off his bone spear from his back.

Though simple, the spear had been roughly polished. But seeing the bloodstains on it revealed that this bone spear had killed many lives.

Due to poor land, eight out of ten Beast Clan giants relied on hunting for survival. Their innate strength made them natural warriors from birth.

Although the Beast Clan giants were gifted, they had a fatal weakness: their insatiable appetite. They needed massive energy to sustain themselves. Because of this, the number of Beast Clan giants decreased every year.

"Come down!" The Beast Clan giant roared, throwing his bone spear toward the dragon in the sky.

"Whoosh..." A gust of wind blew. The bone spear transformed into a streak of light, instantly piercing the dragon in the sky and causing large amounts of blood to fall from the sky.

"Boom..." The massive body, over ten zhang long, crashed down like a mountain and fell into the ground.

"Ha! I can finally have a full meal!" The giant's face showed a simple smile. He pulled out the bone spear, as if weightless, and grabbed the head of the dead dragon on his shoulder. He walked toward the mountain range.

But just as the giant had taken two steps, a streak of light fell from the sky and smashed onto his back.

"Boom..." The massive dragon was shattered by the streak of light, instantly turning into a pile of meat and splattering onto the giant's body.

"Oh?" The giant spoke in a deep voice, turning around with confusion. His eyes looked like he had seen a ghost and took three steps back.

"What is it?" The giant asked, then saw a small figure lying on the ground. It was absorbing the dragon's blood into its body.

Chapter 1215: Manlie

The tall giant looked at the small figure on the ground, his eyes filled with confusion. He circled it twice. Years of hunting had honed the giant's keen senses, and he could sense a threat from this small figure.

"Destroyed our dinner. This person is so small, but it doesn't matter. Let's take him back!" The giant showed a hint of regret, looking at the figure that had absorbed the dragon's blood. He placed it on his shoulder.

"Alas... I've been chasing this dragon for days," the giant muttered as he walked toward the mountain range.

Ancient buildings were all built from stones. A group of massive figures walked through the stone village, their heavy steps producing a deep sound.

"Chu Chen大哥 (Big Brother Chu Chen), you're back! I heard you went after a dragon!" The giant had just entered the stone village when several children-like giants came out, surrounding his body.

"Here, he ate it!" Hearing the children's calls, the giant sighed and placed the figure on the ground.

"What is this? So small. He's not even as tall as me! Is he a human? I've never seen one!" A boy with a fierce face came out, crouching on the ground and using his thick fingers to fiddle with the figure lying there. His eyes were full of curiosity.

"What is this?" As Chu Chen returned, some middle-aged giants came out from the stone village. They all looked at the figure that was much smaller than them with curiosity.

"Chu Chen, this is the dragon you chased for days. It's not even enough to fill my teeth!" People smiled, surrounding the small figure.

"You shouldn't underestimate this little one. He smashed the dragon into a mist of blood!" Chu Chen's face showed some fear, recalling this small figure's weirdness. He told people not to get too close.

"Nothing wrong, he looks like us. But this one is just too small. He's even shorter than my leg! Our tribe's shortest child is much taller than him!" People discussed, but they were simple and didn't think of harming this small person.

"Hey, Chu Chen, did you not catch a dragon and just brought back such a small thing? You're making up stories to trick us!" A young man of the same height as Chu Chen came out from the crowd, his face showing disdain. He walked toward the figure lying on the ground.

At the moment this young man stepped out, all the other giants showed a bit of respect and lightly tapped their shoulders to show reverence for him.

"Only this small thing, I can crush it with one finger!" Manlie stepped out of the crowd and approached Chu Chen. He sneered, then waved his massive hand toward the figure on the ground.

"Smack..." But before his hand fell, Chu Chen stopped him. His face showed fear: "Manlie, what I said was true. This little one is weird!"

"Move aside! Don't you know your status? How dare you stop me!" Hearing Chu Chen's words, especially seeing him block his hand, Manlie's face showed anger and he scolded Chu Chen.

"Status!" Hearing Manlie's words, Chu Chen's face turned grim. He released Manlie's hand and took a few steps back.

"Alas... poor child!" Seeing Chu Chen's face, the other giants shook their heads. They turned their eyes toward Manlie.

"I'll expose your lie today!" Seeing Chu Chen retreat, Manlie's face showed a hint of triumph. He swung his hand again and rushed toward the figure on the ground.

"What are you doing!" Seeing Manlie's hand rushing toward his small person, Chu Chen's face changed. He pushed off the ground and appeared beside Manlie, stopping him.

"Smack..." The two massive hands collided with a clear sound. Manlie's strong body took two steps back, his eyes showing coldness.

"He's small, but he's not food. What you're doing is no different from killing!" Chu Chen shouted angrily, his eyes filled with anger.

This person was small, but he was the one Chu Chen had brought back. If it were a wild beast, that would be fine. But this person was different from them in size only; otherwise, he looked like them. How could Chu Chen allow himself to watch this person be killed?

"Hmph, Chu Chen, you're a bastard. How dare you stop me? In this small South Ridge, I can do whatever I want. Because I'm a Man!" Manlie shouted loudly, not respecting Chu Chen at all. He took a step forward toward the small person.

"Alas..." The other giants showed long sighs. "Man" was a big surname in the Wild Continent. Those with the Man name had a connection to the Man God of the Beast Clan, and they were all prestigious. In the entire Wild Continent, anyone with the surname Man was exalted.

Actually, Chu Chen should have had the surname Man too. Like Manlie, he was the son of the city's governor from a thousand miles away in South Ridge. However, Manlie was the legitimate eldest son and had high status. Chu Chen was a bastard child, born accidentally by the governor. He even lacked a name and took his mother's surname, being of low status.

But Chu Chen was gifted. At ten years old, he had immense strength and could carry a mountain weighing ten thousand jin. Thus, he lived well in Qinghe City and was gradually accepted by the governor.

Manlie's mother felt threatened by Chu Chen, so she sent him to South Ridge.

Chu Chen was easygoing but had some resentment. However, he was still young and knew that an arm couldn't beat a leg. He lived quietly in South Ridge, getting along well with the people of the stone village.

This time Manlie passed through South Ridge and remembered his low-status brother. He wanted to humiliate him but hadn't expected Chu Chen's strength was so strong, even stronger than his years of training in Qinghe City.

"Do you really want to protect him? You know that in the Beast Clan, defying a Man surname's command will result in punishment!" Manlie coldly spoke, gazing at Chu Chen.

"I do. This is a life, not an animal. I brought him back; I must be responsible for him!" Chu Chen's eyes were determined, his voice resolute.

"Good. You all, what are you waiting for? Bring this rebel down!" Manlie ordered the people in the stone village, his voice carrying command.

"This..." The people's faces showed hesitation. On one side was the future governor of Qinghe City, Manlie, and on the other was Chu Chen who had lived in the stone village for years. They were like family.

"We can't!" A middle-aged giant spoke, his voice carrying refusal and taking a few steps back.

"I can't either. The Beast Clan people, although they believe in the Man God, are still humans!" Other stone village people also took a few steps back. Chu Chen had lived with them for years, and they were like family. How could they attack?

"I'll do it!" But someone still wanted to flatter Manlie and decided to attack Chu Chen. A tall middle-aged giant stepped out, his eyes showing a hint of battle intent toward Chu Chen.

"Qin Li!" Someone spoke, their face filled with anger. They hadn't expected someone to choose Manlie's side at this moment.

"Uncle Qin, are you really going to attack me?" Chu Chen frowned slightly. He looked at the middle-aged giant and spoke softly, his voice carrying a hint of reluctance.

"Going up is human nature. Water flows downward. I don't want to stay in this small South Ridge forever!" Qin Li's face showed a hint of longing as he spoke.

"Chu Chen, you're the Nine Source Supreme. I'm just a step toward transcendence. You can't beat me! Give up!" Qin Li spoke softly, not wanting to offend Chu Chen too much. After all, Chu Chen was the governor's son. If the old governor suddenly remembered having such a son, he would have trouble.

"No!" Chu Chen's face was resolute. He spoke again and stood beside Qin Li, his body radiating fierce energy. Years of battling凶兽 (fierce beasts) had forged Chu Chen's fierce spirit.

"Then I'll have to do it myself!" Qin Li's eyes turned cold. He saw Manlie's displeasure and extended his hand to strike Chu Chen.

Chu Chen showed a hint of determination. He was also furious at Manlie's arrogance. Both had the same father, but while Manlie grew up in Qinghe City, he had to fight fierce beasts and survive for years in South Ridge. It was a world of difference.

A green light enveloped Chu Chen's body. Facing Qin Li's hand, he didn't fear and threw a punch toward him.

"Boom..." The next moment, an astonishing scene appeared. Qin Li, who had thought he would win easily, showed disbelief on his face. His massive body flew backward and crashed onto the ground. His hand was cracked, a sight to behold.

"Transcendence! Chu Chen used transcendence power. He has become a transcendent!" The stone village's two hundred giants showed joy, surprised that Chu Chen had become transcendence so quickly.

"Transcendence!" Manlie's face was grim. He had only eight sources, while Chu Chen, the bastard child who had been exiled, had become transcendence. This made him even more jealous.

"Let's go!" But Manlie wasn't that foolish. He knew if he fought Chu Chen directly, he wouldn't gain anything.

"Can't stay! Mustn't stay!" Manlie vowed in his heart. Once back to Qinghe City, he would find a way to eliminate Chu Chen. If left to grow, he might threaten him.

Qin Li stood up and looked at Chu Chen. He followed Manlie out of the stone village, knowing he had no way to stay there anymore.

Chapter 1216: Awakening

"Transcendence!"

"Chu Chen has become transcendence! One punch knocked out Qin Li!" The two hundred giants in the stone village showed joy. They hadn't expected Chu Chen to become transcendence so quickly.

"Transcendence!" Manlie's face was grim. He had only eight sources, while Chu Chen, the exiled bastard child, had become transcendence. This made him even more jealous.

"Let's go!" But Manlie wasn't that foolish. He knew if he fought Chu Chen directly, he wouldn't gain anything.

"Can't stay! Mustn't stay!" Manlie vowed in his heart. Once back to Qinghe City, he would find a way to eliminate Chu Chen. If left to grow, he might threaten him.

Qin Li stood up and looked at Chu Chen. He followed Manlie out of the stone village, knowing he had no way to stay there anymore.
