The blood-red figures instantly surrounded Luo Tian, their eyes filled with amusement as they gazed upon him.

Luo Tian transformed into golden light, flying toward his physical body because he knew he was drifting further away from it. If he failed to find his flesh, he would be forced to wander endlessly through this space until old age claimed him.

Observing the surrounding blood-red figures, Luo Tian did not wish to end up like their soul essences or fragmented spirits.

"Such a lack of manners!" The blood-red figures rushed toward Luo Tian, biting at him. Perhaps they had spent too long in this space and forgotten their martial techniques.

"Go away..." Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, devoid of mercy. His hand glowed with brilliance, and the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist surged forward, shattering the red figure before him. His body continued flying toward his physical form.

"Ugh, strong. Let's not bother him; he'll return himself soon!" Seeing Luo Tian's formidable power, the blood-red figures abandoned their attack.

Luo Tian's soul essence flew swiftly through the thick, viscous blood qi, sensing his proximity to his physical body increasing. A glimmer of joy flickered in his eyes.

Yet, during the journey, Luo Tian felt his soul essence gradually turning red, as if it were being slowly corrupted by the blood qi.

"Can't afford to be slow; this blood qi feels off!" Luo Tian's golden light dimmed significantly, his face etched with anxiety.

"Burn your soul essence!" Luo Tian's heart pounded with fear, activating the幽冥鬼步 (Yao Ming Gui Bu) to its peak. Within a few heartbeats, he found the nearest spatial rift leading toward his physical body.

"This is it! No more delays!" Luo Tian gazed at the barrier before him, then at his hands and body. His soul essence had lost its golden hue, now tinged with a pinkish red.

"Kid, you can't escape from here; no one has ever broken through this barrier!"

"But this kid's strange—after so long, he hasn't been assimilated. He's got some skill!" The blood-red figures watched Luo Tian attempting to break the barrier, offering a warning.

"I'll show you!" Luo Tian sneered, his hand flashing with golden light as he transformed his soul essence into a golden sword. He slashed it against the barrier.

"Buzz..." In an instant, amidst the gazes of countless blood-red soul essences, a faint light emerged within their vision.

Chapter 1090: The World Watches in Awe

On the demon clan's mountain, people watched the slowly healing rift in space, their eyes filled with awe. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so easily defeated.

Observing Luo Tian's closed eyes in his physical form, they sighed inwardly and wondered why Cao Yuanshan hadn't intervened to save him.

"Is it over?" Yan Hongtao's face bore confusion, still in soul essence form without returning to his body.

"This boy truly defies fate; he escaped such a dire situation!" The Star Luo Domain Master spoke from above, his eyes filled with admiration as he gazed into the void.

Others nodded in approval, but the six words spoken by him remained unheard.

"I said he could come out on his own!" Cao Yuanshan lightly stroked his beard, a smile playing on his lips.

"Hmph... even if he emerges, his strength will be diminished; he'll still be no match for Hongtao!" Yan Xiuluo scowled, his eyes filled with concern. He hoped Yan Hongtao wouldn't underestimate the opponent.

After a few heartbeats, Yan Hongtao sighed and flew toward his physical body. He knew if Luo Tian hadn't emerged, he was truly lost. He had once exiled several soul essences before and never seen anyone return from that place.

But as Yan Hongtao turned, a blood-red rift appeared in the sky. A golden sword shot forth at breakneck speed, instantly appearing behind Yan Hongtao. The golden blade seemed like a divine weapon, slicing through his blood-red soul essence in an instant.

"Ah..." Yan Hongtao screamed, his soul essence split into two halves, crying out as it transformed into two blood mists before the onlookers.

"Ah..."

"He truly shattered that barrier!" A deep roar echoed through the void, as several blood-red soul essences near Luo Tian cried out. White sunlight illuminated their forms, seemingly repelling them. In an instant, several blood-red soul essences were annihilated, emitting white smoke.

"Out... he's out!" The spectators' faces bore shock; they hadn't expected Luo Tian to emerge again under such circumstances.

"Ha! That's the real Luo Tian!" Zheng Xin and others sighed in relief, then burst into wild laughter.

"Buzz..." The golden sword slowly transformed back into Luo Tian's form, and the rift in space gradually healed.

"Ah..." As Luo Tian just formed his human shape, his soul essence writhed in agony, rolling through the air. At the same time, white mist rose from his soul essence.

"What's going on?" People were stunned, watching the once formidable Luo Tian—his soul essence transformed into a sword that had split Yan Hongtao in two—now reduced to this state.

"Zhi..." White smoke rose from Luo Tian's body, the extreme pain directly affecting his soul essence. It was far more intense than physical pain.

"Why isn't Luo Tian's soul essence golden? It looks like it has a hint of red!" Someone finally spoke, noticing Luo Tian's anomaly.

"It's been tainted by that space's aura; our space is rejecting it, purifying the foreign essence within Luo Tian's soul!" People finally understood the situation.

"Who knows how much it'll be purified? It might cause some damage, but it shouldn't kill Luo Tian. Didn't you see how several blood-red figures were annihilated after the space opened?" They waited patiently for Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, Yan Hongtao's soul essence—split into two and turned to blood mist—was slowly recovering, gradually forming a human shape.

"Roar..." Luo Tian's soul essence howled into the sky, its wild waves colliding with Yan Hongtao's forming mist. In an instant, it scattered the blood mist.

People were speechless, watching the red mist—once forming a shape—scattered by Luo Tian's waves. They silently sighed; Yan Hongtao must be extremely frustrated now.

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian's roar gradually lessened. His waves calmed, and his soul essence returned to golden hues—though significantly dimmer than before. He gazed at the slowly forming blood mist.

Without Luo Tian's interference, Yan Hongtao gradually coalesced but was in worse condition than Luo Tian. He seemed on the verge of dissipating at any moment.

Yan Hongtao was utterly frustrated; he had been split open by Luo Tian, suffering a fundamental wound. Later, when he tried to form his soul essence, it was repeatedly interrupted by Luo Tian's attacks. This made his injuries worse, leaving him powerless to fight.

"Continue?" Luo Tian smiled, his weakened soul essence emitting the Great Dao's power as he gazed at Yan Hongtao. He could feel his own weakness but knew Yan Hongtao was even weaker, unable to withstand a single punch.

"Again!" Yan Hongtao gritted his teeth, gazing at Luo Tian with determination. His soul essence drifted forward, aiming for a mutual destruction.

"Mutual destruction? You're not ready yet!" Luo Tian sneered, rushing toward Yan Hongtao. A faint golden light rose from his fist.

"Yan Hongtao has lost!" As the two clashed, Shrouded Domain Master Yan Xiuluo appeared between them. With a wave of his hand, both soul essences were sent flying back into their physical bodies.

At the same time, the surrounding blood monsters exploded, and the arena returned to normal.

"Boom..." As Yan Xiuluo's words echoed, the crowd on the demon mountain erupted in excitement. They gazed at Luo Tian, who slowly opened his eyes, appearing somewhat weak.

Luo Tian of the Four Sacred Star Domains had proven himself through his strength. No matter what awaited him in the future, he was now the world's focus—unbeatable among his peers.

"I hope Luo Tian meets Huo Chen of the Chaos Domain and Shen Nu Sun Mengru of the Divine Clan. The battle between the three divine bodies would be even more spectacular!"

"Unfortunately, if they don't meet now, when these prodigies reach the peak of immortals, Luo Tian will no longer be unbeatable. He'll be left behind like a fleeting meteor, shining briefly before fading into darkness!" People sighed, gazing at Luo Tian.

Yan Hongtao's face was pale as a sheet of paper, gazing at Luo Tian. He felt defeated after exhausting all his secrets and still losing to Luo Tian.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, feeling as if his body had been emptied. His legs felt weak, but his eyes burned with excitement. Though it was a hard-earned victory, he had finally avenged his grudge at the entrance of the Divine and Demon Domain.

"He's truly powerful!" In the Chaos Domain, Zhu Ge Huang Chao slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was calm as he spoke softly.

"Have you come to terms with it?" The Chaos Domain Master's eyes showed satisfaction as he nodded at Zhu Ge Huang Chao.

"Yes, the current outcome doesn't mean much. The greatest battle lies in becoming the Master of the Epoch. At that time, these people might all become my enemies; it's uncertain who will be on top!" Zhu Ge Huang Chao spoke, his voice filled with yearning.

"Luo Tian!" Zheng Xin and others roared, rushing to surround Luo Tian and helping him off the arena.

"Everyone, the match is over. Our demon clan's ritual has been completed!" Nan Gong Bo smiled as he stood beneath the sky, speaking loudly.

"For the next seven days, our demon clan will prepare wine and delicacies. Friends who wish to stay can do so for seven days; we welcome you!" Nan Gong Bo spoke, addressing the next steps.

"Congratulations on your re-election as clan leader!"

"Clan Leader Nan Gong, my Light Illumination Academy will heed the demon clan's commands... My Ten Thousand Fortress..." One by one, sect masters and elders approached to congratulate Nan Gong Bo on becoming clan leader. Some saint sons and daughters surrounded Nan Gong Yuqing, offering congratulations.

"Cough cough! On this joyous occasion of the divine clan's ritual, I also have an important announcement to make!" The old divine king stood up slowly. His voice was calm but silenced the entire mountain, as everyone respectfully gazed at him—Sun Shengtian.

"Sun Shengtian, what are you up to? Speak plainly; don't act so authoritative. What's the point of showing off your power? If I'm leaving, I'll go!" Shrouded Domain Master Yan Xiuluo spoke, his gaze filled with disdain. He thought the divine clan's king was being pretentious.

"Ah, Shrouded Brother, don't rush; I'll speak now!"

"The announcement is that our divine clan's princess and prince will hold their wedding in three months. Everyone, please come to celebrate with us!" The divine clan's king smiled, his calm voice echoing in everyone's ears.

As the divine clan's king's words finished, a momentary silence fell over the mountain before murmurs of excitement erupted. Their gazes turned to Sun Feiwen.

"Congratulations, Holy Prince!" People smiled and greeted Sun Feiwen, their congratulations echoing across the mountain.

Sun Feiwen's heart ached with bitterness, gazing at the smiling faces around him. He sighed deeply.

But before Sun Feiwen could speak to them, a cold killing intent instantly enveloped him, causing his breath to catch. He instinctively shivered.

Chapter 1091: What Can You Do?

On the demon clan's mountain, the divine clan's king smiled as he announced the wedding of his princess and prince. The entire mountain erupted in congratulations for Sun Feiwen.

Sun Feiwen's face bore a bitter smile, his heart heavy with sorrow. Before he could speak to the crowd, an icy killing intent instantly surrounded him, making his heart race. He looked toward the source of the intent.

"Luo Tian!" Recognizing the cold killing intent, Sun Feiwen gazed at Luo Tian. He wanted to speak but found himself surrounded by fierce killing intent, unable to catch his breath.

Zheng Xin, Long Jie, Cao Dezhu and others all stared at Sun Feiwen with murderous intent. How could Sun Feiwen withstand it?

Luo Tian's eyes instantly turned blood-red, taking a step forward toward Sun Feiwen. His gaze locked onto him, though weakened, he looked more terrifying than ever.

"Are you going to marry Sun Mengru?" Luo Tian's face contorted with rage, stepping before Sun Feiwen. His voice was cold and devoid of emotion.

"Dammit, let me speak!" Sun Feiwen gazed at Luo Tian's eyes as if he wanted to devour him, his heart frantic.

"What's going on?" The crowd looked puzzled, sensing Luo Tian's unusual behavior and murmuring among themselves.

"I heard that Luo Tian has a good relationship with the divine clan's princess. The reason he was suppressed by Heaven is also closely related to her."

"I heard that a few days ago, Luo Tian was ambushed by the sects of the Divine and Demon Domain. It was Sun Mengru who came to his rescue. If not for her, Luo Tian might have been killed by the major sects!" People murmured, their expressions filled with intrigue as they looked at Luo Tian approaching Sun Feiwen.

"Such events could be considered that Luo Tian and Sun Mengru have feelings for each other, but it's understandable for the divine clan's princess to marry the prince!" People awaited the spectacle.

"Luo Tian, listen to me!" Sun Feiwen transmitted his thoughts to Luo Tian because he couldn't speak. Cold sweat dripped from his face as he gazed at the seemingly mad Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Luo Tian said nothing, his weak body suddenly bursting with infinite power. His feet pushed against the ground, cracks spreading beneath him as he leaped into the sky.

"Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian wishes to spar with the divine clan's prince. Does the divine clan's prince dare to face Luo Tian?" Luo Tian's voice thundered from above, his aura weak but his words filled with cold killing intent.

"Is Luo Tian trying to kill Sun Feiwen under the guise of a spar?" The discerning saw his intention and were shocked.

"Luo Tian! Mengru's groom isn't me, you damn fool!"

"I have a fondness for Mengru, but I know we can't be together. So I've always treated her as my sister! The one who will marry her is another!" Sun Feiwen transmitted his thoughts frantically, his voice filled with urgency.

"What? The divine clan's prince isn't you?" Luo Tian's blood-red eyes cleared slightly as he gazed at Sun Feiwen, still intimidating.

"It's truly another person. That person is my divine clan's previous prince—the son of the divine king. He was sealed by the divine king with supreme methods until he sensed the changes in the world and had a chance to become the Master of the Epoch. Then, he was released!" Sun Feiwen's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Isn't it you?" Luo Tian scrutinized Sun Feiwen again, seeing no signs of deception. His eyes cleared as he descended from the sky.

"Luo Tian! What do you mean?" The divine clan's king gazed at Luo Tian with authority, his voice filled with displeasure.

"Nothing! I just don't want the divine clan's princess to marry anyone else!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered, gazing at the divine king.

"Ah..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, the crowd gasped in shock, their gazes filled with disbelief. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so direct and to speak to the divine king in such a manner.

"Everyone who wants to marry Sun Mengru will die!" Luo Tian ignored the divine king's gradually darkening gaze, his eyes resolute as he stared at Sun Shengtian.

"Many years have passed; it's been a long time since anyone spoke to me like that. Youthful arrogance!" The divine king's dark face gradually showed a smile, his gaze on Luo Tian filled with admiration.

"Only I, Luo Tian, can be Sun Mengru's husband!" Luo Tian locked eyes with the divine king without fear.

"Do you believe I can directly kill you in front of Cao Yuanshan and eliminate the threat?" The divine king smiled, his gaze filled with contempt.

"Divine clan's Indestructible Body? Are you trying to use this opportunity to eliminate an enemy for your son? The world is ruled by strength alone. I believe if it weren't for Cao Yuanshan's protection, I wouldn't have survived until now! If I were a peak Epoch轮回体 (Reincarnation Body), would you dare speak to me like this? There are many who want to kill Luo Tian. You, a divine clan's king, won't know who will kill whom in a hundred years!" Luo Tian's eyes showed disdain as he spoke calmly.

"Good, good, good! I want to see what you can do. This marriage is set; I'll watch how much chaos you can stir up!"

"Cao Yuanshan, this time I'm giving you face. If there's a next time, it won't be so simple!" Sun Shengtian's voice echoed in people's ears before fading away. He and Sun Feiwen disappeared from sight.

The crowd murmured, watching Luo Tian standing there. Some gazed at him with reverence; others with malicious joy.

Cao Yuanshan appeared beside Luo Tian, his face filled with admiration: "Don't worry; I'll help you. Let's go. There are three months left; we'll head to the Dragon-Devouring Valley and try to improve your strength!"

"Indestructible Body, Sun Lechu?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with intense battle spirit as he gazed at the direction where the divine king had disappeared, his fists tightly clenched.

"Yun Ting, this life, no one will take you from my side!" Luo Tian's eyes showed determination. His mind recalled Sun Feiwen's transmission, explaining the Indestructible Body of Sun Lechu.

Indestructible Body ranks second among the nine bodies. This alone proves how powerful Sun Lechu is! And he's the son of the divine king, Sun Shengtian. It's clear that Sun Lechu has had an easy life since birth, with endless resources and the divine clan's three great techniques already mastered. Luo Tian had witnessed the terrifying power of these techniques before.

"Brother, good luck! I believe in you!" Zhou Wei smiled as he approached Luo Tian and patted his shoulder to encourage him.

"Kid, just for your words to that old man Sun Shengtian, I'll not assassinate you during these three months. Take your time to improve; we also want to see what tricks you have up your sleeve!" Shrouded Domain Master Yan Xiuluo looked at Luo Tian with interest.

"Under necessary circumstances, the demon clan will stand by your side!" The demon clan's supreme master transmitted to Luo Tian, indicating his support.

People were stunned as they watched Luo Tian—this young man was the first in years to dare challenge the divine clan. Reincarnation Body Luo Tian, this event would make him impossible to ignore. People were curious about what methods he had to challenge a super clan that ranked among the top nine in the nine domains.

"Maybe it's just posturing; he might run away anyway," some still doubted Luo Tian's courage to confront the divine clan directly. After all, it was the divine clan; even with Cao Yuanshan's support, if he caused trouble in their base, it would still be difficult for Cao Yuanshan to handle.

"Thank you all, elders! I'm deeply grateful for your help!" Luo Tian bowed to those who had promised to assist him.

Luo Tian knew these people were just making empty promises. Even the demon clan's supreme master had said he would support him under necessary circumstances, which was clearly implied—Luo Tian needed to prove his worth.

"Alright, Supreme Master of the Demon Clan, we also need to return to the Beast Domain. We'll meet again in three months!" Cao Yuanshan nodded at the supreme master, as time was money. Three months seemed long but was too short for Luo Tian.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian said goodbye to Zhou Wei, giving a few words to Nan Gong Yuqing before leaping into the sky. His face was still pale.

Cao Dezhu, Long Jie and others also took flight, standing before Cao Yuanshan. Cao Yuanshan waved his hand, summoning the Earth Dragon. Luo Tian and others stood on the dragon's back as they vanished from sight.

"They've left; in three months, if Luo Tian returns to the Divine and Demon Domain again, it will be very spectacular!"

The divine clan hadn't been challenged in years. Who dared to challenge them met a bad end. A young genius daring to do so was truly unexpected.

But Luo Tian and his group couldn't hear these words. The massive Earth Dragon flew through the stars, and Luo Tian's face was serious as he gazed at the opposite direction of the demon domain—toward the Divine and Demon Domain.

"Yun Ting, wait for me!" Luo Tian whispered before sitting cross-legged on the dragon's back to heal. He couldn't think of any good methods now; he could only focus on healing his wounds first.

"Let's head directly to the Dragon-Devouring Valley!" Cao Yuanshan lightly patted the Earth Dragon's back. The dragon surged forward at a faster speed, like a meteor, heading toward the Beast Domain.

The Earth Dragon's speed was fast. With Cao Yuanshan's enhancement, they reached the entrance of the Beast Domain in three days. They rushed into it and passed through the Holy City. Cao Yuanshan and Luo Tian leaped off the dragon's back, flying toward the north of the Beast Domain. That was the Dragon-Devouring Valley—the place where Cao Yuanshan had once collected the Indestructible Life Bamboo.

Chapter 1092: Dragon-Devouring Valley

Dragon-Devouring Valley, one of the nine deadly regions in the nine domains, located to the north of the Beast Domain. The entire land appeared as a dragon shape from outer space. It was called a deadly region because the whole land was wrapped in imperial dragon qi, and those below the saint level couldn't approach it.

Even saints at the initial or middle stages could only move around the perimeter; going deeper was impossible due to the overwhelming dragon power.

Five days had passed since Luo Tian left the Divine and Demon Domain. In five days, news of the events spread gradually. However, in just five days, it hadn't reached all nine domains yet. But the surrounding two or three star regions had already heard about it.

Killing the elders and princes of various sects in the Divine and Demon Domain's ancient cave, the tournament at the demon clan's ritual, defeating various domain princes, and confronting the divine clan's king—those who heard about it were all stunned. Their faces showed admiration, and they raised their thumbs for Luo Tian.

At this moment, the protagonist Luo Tian stood at the entrance of Dragon-Devouring Valley. Beside him was an old man in purple robes, his face calm but filled with intense caution as he gazed at the valley.

"Feeling it?" Cao Yuanshan spoke, his gaze on Luo Tian's contemplative expression.

"Yes, it's truly terrifying. The entire land seems like a sleeping true dragon. This imperial dragon qi produces pressure that even I must be careful with!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the valley shaped like a coiled dragon.

Due to being one of the nine deadly regions, it was renowned far and wide. Few dared to wander here, so there were no cultivators around Luo Tian and Cao Yuanshan.

"Let's go. I once冒险 (risked) to enter it when I was at the peak of saint level. Hopefully, the terrain hasn't changed. If it has, that'll be a problem!" Cao Yuanshan's expression was serious as he waved his hand, lifting Luo Tian and flying toward the dragon-shaped land.

Luo Tian followed Cao Yuanshan, protected by him as they rushed into the imperial dragon qi. With Cao Yuanshan's protection, the waves of imperial dragon qi couldn't harm Luo Tian.

But Luo Tian could clearly feel the imperial dragon qi becoming denser and more oppressive, to a point that made him shudder. It was an instinctive pressure. Even Cao Yuanshan was affected, slowing down his speed.

"This feeling!" Luo Tian felt this pressure was familiar, as if he had experienced it before. His brows furrowed deeply.

After recalling for a while, Luo Tian finally remembered where this familiar feeling came from—exactly the same as when he faced Meng Lingyun's half-body in the Yuan Gu Tian Palace.

"Master, is there a master of an epoch within this Dragon-Devouring Valley?" Luo Tian asked in a trembling voice, addressing Cao Yuanshan.

"It seems so. This land was once the domain of a great cultivator from the Beast Domain. No one knows what his true form was, but he was incredibly powerful. He disliked conflicts and thus lived in seclusion here!"

"But how could such a great cultivator be buried in the passage of time? People noticed that no matter how talented these prodigies were, none became masters of an epoch. This caught people's attention. Eventually, the great sects of the nine domains summoned a master from Star Luo Domain. Using the lives of three epoch-level masters as a sacrifice, they finally uncovered the reason!" Cao Yuanshan slowed his pace while explaining the origin of Dragon-Devouring Valley.

"And this epoch master, in his youth, had the same experience as you—he was suppressed by Heaven!" Cao Yuanshan's face showed admiration, continuing his speech. Though his voice was calm, it stirred a storm in Luo Tian's heart.

Suppressed by Heaven and yet becoming an epoch master—Luo Tian couldn't imagine how extraordinary this ancient cultivator must have been. He knew well the hardships of being suppressed by Heaven.

"But this is what I learned after entering Dragon-Devouring Valley back then. Later, a great cultivator from the Beast Domain's dragon clan attempted to kill this epoch master when his time was near, hoping to seize everything he possessed. They attacked Dragon-Devouring Valley with the dragon clan's forces."

"The result was that this dragon clan epoch-level master perished, and the attacking dragons were almost annihilated. Only a few escaped. Hence, this place was named Dragon-Devouring Valley. From then on, the dragon clan began to decline, and the phoenix clan gradually rose. The dragon clan lost so many people, even an epoch-level master was killed; thus, they began to decline." Cao Yuanshan spoke, his voice filled with admiration.

"An epoch master must not be disrespected; even in old age, no one can target them! An epoch master is essentially a god in this world; they are invincible for an entire epoch!" Luo Tian nodded slightly, surprised by the secret history of the Beast Domain's dragon clan.

"Take out your Epoch Bell, for I'm not sure if I can protect you anymore!" As they spoke, the two finally landed on this land. A series of real dragon-like figures continuously roared at them, striking Cao Yuanshan's shield.

Luo Tian didn't delay; he felt if he lost Cao Yuanshan's protection, he might be torn apart by the imperial dragon qi. He quickly summoned his Epoch Bell to protect himself and Cao Yuanshan.

"Good, with this pseudo-epoch treasure, my confidence has increased!" Cao Yuanshan smiled at the surroundings.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with purple light, scanning around. Through the thick imperial dragon qi, he could only see a few tens of feet ahead.

As Luo Tian observed carefully, he felt a sense of alarm; although this land was wrapped in imperial dragon qi, the plants and trees on the ground were unaffected by it.

In his view, grasses and flowers rushed past, appearing like normal plants and trees. Misty mountains and rivers appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

"Let's continue forward. Though there have been some changes, if we search carefully, I can still find the place from before!" Cao Yuanshan's voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. The two figures cautiously moved toward the land's depths.

Soon, they reached a cliff. Cao Yuanshan's eyes showed calculation as he gazed at the valley below, his face showing a hint of joy.

"Jump down!" Before Luo Tian could react, Cao Yuanshan carried him and leaped into the bottomless cliff.

How deep was this cliff? Luo Tian didn't know, but they fell for nearly a quarter of an hour before finally landing on solid ground.

"Boom..." Their feet hit the ground, and even with Luo Tian's saint-level middle strength, his legs felt numb. His eyes saw stars, and he almost collapsed on the ground.

"Alright, there's no imperial dragon qi here; you can put away your Epoch Bell!" Cao Yuanshan's voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

After a brief confusion, Luo Tian regained his senses and heard Cao Yuanshan's words. He put away the Epoch Bell, gazing around with a look of joy.

Before him was a bamboo forest, its rich vitality making Luo Tian feel comfortable.

"I found the Indestructible Life Bamboo here back then, but it was just luck. Whether we find it depends on our luck. But I found three of them back then; if nothing's changed, there should still be two left!" Cao Yuanshan spoke slowly as he stepped into the bamboo forest, which looked like a grove of trees.

Luo Tian's heart was excited; if he found the Indestructible Life Bamboo and brewed the Reincarnation Pills, then when Sun Mengru took them, she would leave with him willingly. If Sun Mengru was willing, Luo Tian would do everything to take her away.

The vast bamboo forest stretched endlessly. Luo Tian and Cao Yuanshan searched continuously, sensing no danger in the bamboo forest. To save time, Luo Tian decided to search separately from Cao Yuanshan since they also needed to find the method to break Heaven's suppression. He didn't know how long it would take.

Cao Yuanshan initially refused, but under Luo Tian's insistence, they agreed to meet at the point where they first entered the bamboo forest after five days. Then, they separated completely, each heading in opposite directions.

Luo Tian walked slowly through the bamboo forest, his spiritual sense spreading out to search for any bamboo that differed from ordinary ones.

"One day... two days..." Luo Tian walked for two days but found nothing. Though he found several bamboo with strong vitality, they weren't the Indestructible Life Bamboo.

After two days, Luo Tian had completely lost contact with Cao Yuanshan, walking alone through this vast and lifeless bamboo forest.

Another two days passed; time flew by quickly, and Luo Tian's eyes gradually showed anxiety. This bamboo forest was surprisingly large; even after five days, he felt like he had only covered half of it.

The entire bamboo forest was silent; besides the sound of Luo Tian's footsteps, there were only occasional gentle winds rustling through the bamboo.

"Hey... this path is mine, these trees are mine; if you want to pass, leave me some firewood!" Just as Luo Tian was anxious, a loud voice suddenly rose in the silent bamboo forest, startling him. It was too sudden, leaving Luo Tian with no preparation at all.

Chapter 1093: Star Dragon Ants
