“Earth Store King’s Palace is divided into 108 palaces. The strongest among each palace may enter the true inheritance realm, obtaining the Earth Store King’s legacy and becoming the next rightful Earth Store King!” A figure stood within one of the ten palaces.

His robes were as white as snow, his silver hair cascading down, a crimson mask covering his face. In his grasp was an ice sword; his blood-red eyes gleamed with depth, standing there in low self-talk.

“This Earth Store King’s inheritance—I must help Xiao Tian obtain it!”

“But before that, I need to break through these 108 palaces. I believe Xiao Tian will also emerge from the other palaces, entering the true inheritance realm!” Blood-Faced’s eyes flashed with confidence. He leapt into the air, his ice sword suddenly shifting to a bloodthirsty blade, slicing toward a ghost cultivator at the late stage of True Immortal within his spiritual awareness.

At the same time, others discovered the rules of Earth Store King’s Palace and began slaughtering those around them.

Luotian walked through the dark earth, having slain five youths upon his initial arrival. Since then, he had encountered no one else.

“Just how do I escape this place?” Luotian gazed toward a towering black pillar of light.

Since entering that day, he had noticed the presence of this black pillar—visible from any direction within the space.

Luotian had steadily advanced toward it, cautious in his pace due to unfamiliarity with this realm. He feared encountering an unexpected danger.

Mountains, earth, lakes—this space contained them all, yet they were stained with ink-like darkness, rendering the entire world grim and eerie.

“Roar…” As Luotian walked, a thunderous roar echoed in his ears. The sound of combat reached his perception, drawing his attention toward the battle’s direction. He flew toward it.

Short of time, Luotian arrived at the battlefield. His spiritual awareness cloaked him, concealing his form. He observed the scene: a monstrous creature over thirty zhang in height bellowed, its thick legs ending in sharp claws. Its robust body shimmered with radiance; four hardened arms terminated not in hands but four bone-like daggers. Its massive head bore exposed teeth, each resembling a dagger, with hollow eyes that appeared grotesque. Two black ox horns crowned its head, radiating cold glimmers.

Each movement of the monster caused tremors; its speed was unparalleled, leaving those who attacked it in disarray.

Three figures—each wielding a long sword, a broadsword, and a golden spear respectively—surrounded the beast.

“What is this thing?” Luotian marveled, recalling *Shan Hai Jing* but finding no record of such a ghostly creature.

The three youths possessed early-stage True Immortal cultivation, yet their attacks left only shallow marks on the beast’s radiant body.

“Roar…” The monster suddenly opened its maw, lunging at one youth. The latter failed to react in time, catching a foul stench.

“Buzz…” Those who entered Earth Store King’s Palace were seasoned warriors. The youth, having faced countless deaths, gritted his teeth and raised his mid-grade immortal artifact to block.

“Crack…” The beast’s jaws clamped onto the youth’s sword, shattering it into fragments. The youth narrowly escaped.

“Kill…” The other two companions moved their hands, one wielding a storm of spears while the other unleashed a sky-shattering sword aura toward the beast.

Explosions echoed as the beast roared, standing amidst the storm of attacks. The spear and sword cuts sliced across its body.

“Flee…” The three exchanged glances, sharing an unspoken understanding, then scattered in three directions.

At the moment they fled, they suddenly shot a finger toward Luotian’s concealed location.

Three attacks thundered forward, causing Luotian to grimace. He hadn’t expected himself to be discovered.

Without hesitation, he launched a punch toward the attacks. Each finger strike forced him back a step.

Luotian’s eyes flashed with ferocity as he pursued the three figures, but before he could take a step, a dark light descended from above. A chilling aura froze his movement. His body twisted abruptly.

A tearing sound echoed as the dark light sliced through Luotian’s robe, a fragment of cloth falling from his body. His eyes narrowed with seriousness.

Luotian now possessed numerous treasures, having accumulated ten billion battle merits. Though he hadn’t personally exchanged them, Ye Liangchen would never neglect him. His entire body was equipped with mid-grade immortal artifacts, including this very robe.

Yet the attack had severed his robe as if cutting tofu, revealing its formidable power.

The roar snapped Luotian back to his senses, darkening his expression. The attack had been from the beast he’d previously fought.

“What in hell is this thing!” Luotian seethed, memorizing the three youths’ appearances. They had clearly discovered him and deliberately lured the beast toward him.

“Buzz…” As Luotian cursed internally, four long arms lunged at him again, leaving no escape.

“Damn it!” Luotian cursed inwardly, twisting his body and drawing the Rending Heaven Spear. He gripped it with both hands, intercepting the four dark slashes.

The next moment, the four arms slammed onto the Rending Heaven Spear. Luotian could see the four black daggers inches from his eyes.

“Boom…” He felt as if a mountain had crushed him, his blood churning and spewing a mouthful of blood onto the beast’s head.

His body was driven into the ground, his legs sinking into it.

“Damn, this strength is too much!” Luotian’s heart raced. He hadn’t expected the beast to be so formidable; even his body, already strong, couldn’t match it.

“Buzz…” As Luotian marveled, the four black arms pressed down again, making his lips twitch.

“Get out of my way!” Luotian roared, continuously intercepting with the Rending Heaven Spear. The thunderous sound spread outward, sending black stone fragments flying.

Smoke billowed as a golden light burst through it—Luotian’s battered figure. His arms trembled, and his body was riddled with bloodstains.

“Bad luck! Those three bastards, I’ll remember this!” Luotian shouted. The beast was a formidable opponent; unless he unleashed significant resources, he could only be beaten.

“Boom…” Luotian stood again, gazing at the beast charging toward him. After battling a while, he gradually discerned its weakness: it moved slowly.

“Bastards! Come on, chase me!” Luotian roared and leapt into the air.

“They could have escaped, but they deliberately lured the beast toward me. If it were anyone else, even a True Immortal at early or middle stage, they might have been killed by carelessness!” Luotian had already judged the three. They were no good people.

“Don’t care which legion you’re from—dare to mess with me, don’t let me see you again!” Luotian cursed inwardly.

Seeing his prey escape, the beast erupted in fury. Its hollow eyes glowed with black mist, which condensed into a tangible force sweeping across the world.

The beast’s speed was slow, but the black mist moved swiftly, instantly engulfing Luotian from behind. He tried to dodge but failed, raising a barrier to withstand the black mist’s impact.

The golden barrier was corroded instantly by the black mist, which seeped into Luotian’s body. His face contorted in shock.

“What… is this thing?” A cold aura swept over his body, but it caused no tangible harm. Luotian was puzzled.

However, his expression changed as the black mist entered his dantian, instantly enveloping it. It severed his connection to his dantian, cutting off his spiritual energy.

At that moment, Luotian was in the sky without spiritual energy. His body plummeted downward.

“Boom…” The earth cracked, dust billowed. Luotian trembled on the ground but dared not move—he ran.

“Rumble…” As Luotian just escaped, the earth thundered. The beast’s massive body marched forward toward him.

Meanwhile, the ground where Luotian had stood rose with rows of bone spikes, causing him to gasp.

Seeing those bone spikes, even Luotian felt a profound crisis. His current state was dire; his spiritual energy seemed sealed, rendering him powerless.

Run—this was Luotian’s sole thought: flee this beast as far as possible.

But the beast seemed to have targeted Luotian, relentlessly pursuing him.

“Roar…” On the black earth, dust swirled as Luotian ran endlessly. Behind him rose countless bone spikes; a black, massive creature roared and chased after him.

Time passed slowly. Luotian’s eyes remained fixed on the towering black pillar. He guessed people would be there—many people. Though reluctant, he knew his current strength couldn’t match the beast.

As Luotian ran toward the black pillar, a mountain peak held hundreds of figures standing there, their faces cold.

A chaotic crowd—frontline youths radiated powerful auras.

These individuals possessed early-stage True Immortal strength, yet their eyes held arrogance. They were renowned in Hell as prodigies.

“Sun Menlie, are you certain that Luotian is in this space?” A youth spoke, holding a black fan with a moon of evil etched on it.

In Hell, the Ten Judges ruled, and beneath them were Eight Heavenly Kings. The kings governed over nobles.

Nobles oversaw various families, some strong, others weak. The youths before were descendants of these nobles. Those behind them hailed from different Hell families.

The youth with the fan was Chen Tiansheng, his father a renowned Longsheng Marquis in Hell. His strength ranked among the top ten nobles.

Other youths were also noble descendants, but their status paled compared to Chen Tiansheng’s family. Still, they were notable in Hell.

Sun Menlie was thin and gaunt—exactly the youth who had escaped Luotian earlier. After some recovery, he had summoned these people through means.

“I’m certain it’s Luotian. His strength is formidable!” Sun Menlie’s eyes flickered with fear, recalling Luotian’s ruthless strikes.

“Indeed strong!” Chen Tiansheng’s eyes flickered with concern upon hearing Sun Menlie. Though confident, he wasn’t sure if he could defeat five early-stage True Immortals simultaneously.

“But we outnumber them; it should be fine!” Chen Tiansheng glanced at the people behind him.

These were no pushovers; all desired to slay Luotian, for the reward was a marquis title. Though lowly among nobles, it was still a marquis. Plus, there were substantial rewards.

Chen Tiansheng’s family was a noble house, and his own title would gain the family elder’s attention. The rewards would bring many treasures.

Not only Chen Tiansheng thought this way; others also did. Most of the crowd hailed from families not yet nobles, so their desire for marquis status was even more fervent.

“Everyone, regardless of anything, first find Luotian. As for who kills him—depends on our own abilities!” Chen Tiansheng spoke loudly.

“Tiansheng Gong is truly a role model! I admire your character. If Tiansheng Gong kills Luotian, my family is willing to exchange this marquis title for you with generous rewards!” A large man spoke, his eyes filled with respect.

“Haha, good to hear!” Chen Tiansheng laughed in response. Just as he was about to continue, his gaze turned toward the distance.

Thunderous noise echoed; a black dust cloud rushed toward them. Upon seeing the figure, Sun Menlie’s face lit up with recognition of Luotian.

“How did he look so battered?” People saw Luotian’s plight, first confused then elated.

“Luotian, you can’t run!” Sun Menlie shouted and leapt forward toward Luotian.

“Kill…” Almost instantly, hundreds of figures flew up simultaneously, their eyes filled with visions of marquis status.

“Good people!” Luotian saw Sun Menlie and Chen Tiansheng’s group rushing toward him. Though only hundreds, his eyes gleamed with joy.

“Is it you? You’ve set up a trap here!” Luotian instantly recognized Sun Menlie.

“Huh?” Sun Menlie saw Luotian showed no fear but instead joy, his heart jolted.

“Something’s wrong!” Sun Menlie knew Luotian wasn’t that foolish. His current state must have issues. Almost instantly, he halted his movement.

Sun Menlie stopped, but others didn’t. At that moment, people were consumed by greed, their minds filled with marquis visions.

“Rumble…” Thunderous noise echoed as Luotian rushed toward the crowd like a meteor.

“Kill!” The group shouted, countless martial arts techniques raining down toward Luotian.

“So many people!” Luotian’s lips twitched. He grabbed a golden arrow, and the Bow of Shooting the Sun appeared.

The bowstring curved like a half-moon; a golden streak shot from his hand toward the incoming martial arts.

The Divine Destruction Arrow—Luotian had never used it before. These hundreds of attacks were so strong that a mid-stage True Immortal would be reduced to dust.

Though Luotian was puzzled about why these people recognized him, he had no time to ponder.

Previously, Luotian used the Rending Heaven Spear instead of arrows. Though powerful, it wasn’t a true arrow.

But the Divine Destruction Arrow was an actual arrow and an upper-grade immortal artifact, its power surpassing that of the Rending Heaven Spear.

Most satisfying was that this arrow could be controlled, allowing Luotian to transform it into any kind of arrow he desired.

“Explosion Arrow!” The Divine Destruction Arrow let out a long roar as its golden tip expanded.

“Boom…” In an instant, thunderous explosions echoed across the world. A terrifying storm formed from the martial arts techniques, and the Divine Destruction Arrow was engulfed within it.

Luotian didn’t hesitate; he rushed into the storm, enduring cuts like knives.

“He… he… managed to block our attacks!” Almost everyone was stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luotian rushing into the storm.

“Roar…” As people were stunned, a thunderous roar echoed from afar, heavy footsteps pounding the earth. Their faces changed instantly.

“Crash…” A series of several-zhang-long bone spikes shot up from the ground.

Some Hell cultivators flew in the sky, others stood on the earth. Those flying were better off; those on the ground suffered greatly.

Plop, plop, plop…

Each spike pierced through the ghost cultivators’ bodies, instantly taking their lives. Their faces turned grim.

“That’s the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast!” Those still alive gasped, gazing at the creature devouring the severed corpses.

“Last-generation Earth Store King’s pet?” Almost instantly, many recognized what beast chased Luotian.

“Boom…” As people were stunned, the Rending Ghost Beast’s body began to grow, having devoured dozens of people. After consuming them, it had grown nearly ten zhang in size. Now the beast stood over forty zhang tall.

Even more terrifying was that its aura had surged to mid-stage True Immortal, making people tremble.

“His food is humans; the more he eats, the stronger he becomes!”

“Flee!” People immediately panicked and scattered. Chen Tiansheng and others led the charge without hesitation.

“Damn it, Luotian must have planned this!” The Hell ghost cultivators shouted, their voices filled with anger.

“Why did you come to kill me? If you had just fled, you could have escaped!” Luotian felt elated. With those people blocking for him, he had already exited the Rending Ghost Beast’s pursuit range. He also felt the strange seal in his dantian loosening slightly.

“Haha, you’re welcome to chase whoever you like!” Luotian laughed, his mood lightening as he flew toward the pillar.

“Roar…” However, as Luotian felt elated and awaited the seal’s complete release, a piercing roar echoed in his ears. The Rending Ghost Beast had devoured several people; others scattered, but the beast seemed to have targeted Luotian again. Due to its increased strength, it had also grown faster.

“Haha, Luotian is definitely dead!” Chen Tiansheng and others, after escaping a certain range, saw the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast chasing Luotian. Their eyes gleamed with joy.

“We just need to follow the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast, wait for it to kill that kid, then grab some evidence!” Everyone’s faces showed excitement as they watched Luotian and the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast chase each other.

“I…” Luotian felt the massive creature behind him, his heart trembling again. At times, he could feel the cold wind from its sharp bone spikes—only a few steps away.

“Damn it, you’re all watching! I’ll let you watch!” Luotian saw the people silently following the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast. His eyes flashed with cruelty and immediately turned back toward Chen Tiansheng, Zhang Menlie, and others.

Chapter 2045: Pursuit ()

Luotian turned back, directly confronting the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast. He could no longer endure it—those people clearly wanted to let the beast kill him, then take advantage.

“Crash…” A series of bone spikes shot up from the earth. Luotian moved swiftly, weaving through them and instantly appearing before the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast.

“Is he seeking death?” Seeing Luotian turn back, Chen Tiansheng and others showed surprise. But soon their faces turned joyous.

As they were surprised, Luotian’s body was already before the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast. Its four thick arms transformed into four cold glows, pressing down on Luotian.

This time, the attack was faster than before. The four arms appeared at Luotian’s head in an instant. If not prepared, he might have been crushed to death.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed in Luotian’s ears, making his eyes dizzy. His blood churned; his legs trembled. The earth beneath him cracked continuously.

Luotian spat out a mouthful of old blood, and his body had fine cracks, as if it could break at any moment.

“Get out!” Luotian moved his arms, the Rending Heaven Spear burst from his hands. His body became a streak of light, passing through the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast and rushing toward Chen Tiansheng’s group.

“Is he crazy? That’s a beast comparable to mid-stage True Immortal!” Seeing Luotian, though wounded, rushing toward them, Chen Tiansheng and others showed surprise.

“According to intelligence, this Luotian is strong, but not this strong!” They whispered among themselves.

“Damn it, run!” But soon they saw Luotian rushing toward them while spitting blood. This clearly aimed to repeat the trick, luring the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast toward them.

“Crash…” They weren’t Luotian; they couldn’t withstand the dense bone spikes. Avoiding them was impossible. If unlucky, it would be certain death.

Three to four hundred people scattered in all directions like flies, instantly disappearing from Luotian’s view.

“Have the guts to not run!” Luotian shouted, his voice filled with霸气 (might). He locked onto the fastest fleeing Chen Tiansheng and chased after him.

Chen Tiansheng flew in the sky, but Luotian’s speed on the ground was no slower. He caught up with Chen Tiansheng in an instant.

“You don’t run, have the guts to fight eight hundred battles with me!”

“What hell prodigy are you? Facing me, still get chased!” Luotian shouted repeatedly, holding onto Chen Tiansheng tightly.

“Damn it, what’s wrong with you? Why follow me!” Chen Tiansheng cursed inwardly. He saw Luotian approaching him and noticed the bone spikes behind him, as well as the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast chasing Luotian.

“Get down!” Luotian saw Chen Tiansheng flying in the sky and felt uncomfortable. He raised the Rending Heaven Spear again, shooting it toward Chen Tiansheng.

Not that Luotian didn’t want to use the Bow of Shooting the Sun, but he currently had no spiritual energy. That arrow was shot purely with his physical strength.

And Luotian had just resisted the beast’s attack, even now feeling extremely exhausted.

“Buzz…” The golden Rending Heaven Spear tore through the sky, instantly appearing behind Chen Tiansheng. This made Chen Tiansheng’s mind tremble.

If it were normal, Chen Tiansheng would have found this attack challenging but not insurmountable. However, he was currently fleeing and his mind was hazy.

Feeling the tearing aura behind him, Chen Tiansheng gritted his teeth and waved his hand. A jade pendant flew from his hand, forming a barrier to block the Rending Heaven Spear’s path.

“Roar…” As they fought, the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast also caught up with them. It spat out a black mist, which again wrapped around Luotian’s previous seal and entangled Chen Tiansheng in the air.

“Damn it, it’s Ghost-Eating Mist!” Chen Tiansheng saw the black mist and instantly realized something. His face paled.

“Almost immediately, Chen Tiansheng’s face turned pale and he fell to the ground. He looked at the bone spikes protruding from the earth.”

“Haha, I’ll run ahead!” Luotian let out a long cry and didn’t care about the falling Chen Tiansheng. He continued searching for his next target.

“Ah…” Chen Tiansheng shouted, his eyes filled with terror. But without cultivation, no matter how he struggled, he could only fall to the ground.

“Boom…” Almost instantly, Chen Tiansheng fell onto the earth. Fortunately, his luck was good; he didn’t fall on the protruding bone spikes.

“My mother!” Chen Tiansheng’s urine was almost scared out of him. He looked at the bone spikes beside him, feeling a cold chill down his pants.

“Just a little more and I would have been ruined!” Chen Tiansheng stood up, carefully checked his vital parts. Finding no serious damage, he took a breath. The entire sky turned dark.

“Roar…” A large foot descended from the sky, its soles covered with bone spikes. It stomped toward Chen Tiansheng.

“You mother!” Chen Tiansheng was completely scared, a feeling of helplessness instantly making his legs weak.

“Get out!” Chen Tiansheng shouted, sacrificing all the treasures he could carry. Two roars echoed beside him as two tall figures raised their thick arms, pushing against the large foot. These two ghost creatures were cultivated by Chen Tiansheng and possessed early-stage True Immortal strength.

“Get out… explode… explode…” Chen Tiansheng shouted, his voice filled with madness. All the treasures he had thrown out emitted thunderous explosions.

After this, Chen Tiansheng spat out a mouthful of blood, forming a blood-colored seal covering his entire body. He suddenly stepped on the ground and vanished from the spot.

“Boom…” Thunderous noise echoed as the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast’s thick foot shattered layers of thunder. The two early-stage True Immortal ghost creatures were also crushed by the beast’s foot.

Using the explosion’s power and a secret technique, Chen Tiansheng finally escaped. His body became a streak of light, as if he wasn’t running but flying again. His speed exceeded limits and even surpassed Luotian’s.

“His luck is amazing!” Luotian had thought Chen Tiansheng was definitely dead, but he hadn’t expected him to be so strong. He had paid a heavy price and escaped.

“Luotian, this isn’t over!” Chen Tiansheng’s mad voice echoed in Luotian’s ears. This time, he had sacrificed a lot of treasures and even lost half his life to escape.

“Good! Since it’s not over, let’s continue!” Luotian heard Chen Tiansheng’s words and his eyes gleamed with light. He kicked the ground, chasing after Chen Tiansheng.

“Cough… cough…” Chen Tiansheng spat blood, his speed gradually decreasing. But as soon as it did, Luotian caught up with him, making Chen Tiansheng’s face grim.

“Luotian! You damn bastard, why follow me!” Chen Tiansheng ran again, spitting blood like Luotian had. This blood was entirely due to Luotian’s anger.

“You said it wasn’t over, and I’m fulfilling your wish!” Luotian laughed. After Chen Tiansheng had drawn him in, Luotian had caught his breath and was now closely following Chen Tiansheng.

“I see how long you can endure!” Luotian followed Chen Tiansheng, his eyes sneering.

Chen Tiansheng was truly driven mad by Luotian’s pursuit. He wanted to shake him off but couldn’t. If he received another hit from the Great Void Rending Ghost Beast, he wouldn’t have the strength to withstand it. Thus, Chen Tiansheng could only run desperately.

But Chen Tiansheng had suffered heavy injuries. Luotian was getting closer each time, and Chen Tiansheng could feel that Luotian had once again drawn the Rending Heaven Spear.

“Luotian! Your grandfather!” Chen Tiansheng had no choice but to curse, while his mouth spat blood again. This formed the strange seal to maintain his speed.

“Tsk tsk, your movement is quite good!” Luotian followed Chen Tiansheng and watched his speed increase again, commenting.

“Why did this ghost beast choose me? Is there something on my body that attracted it?”

“Also, why can these Hell cultivators recognize my appearance!” Luotian ran while pondering.

“Don’t think about it now; having this thing following me has become my advantage in this space!” Luotian quickly stopped thinking about other things and focused on where to take this thing. That place would definitely be a battlefield of corpses.

Time passed slowly as Luotian chased Chen Tiansheng, almost making him cry. Each time he reflexively raised the Rending Heaven Spear, Chen Tiansheng would spit blood to maintain his speed.

“Can’t go on like this; if I do, I’ll definitely die! I can’t perform my secret technique too many times!” Chen Tiansheng’s body was emaciated, his vitality seemingly drained. He constantly thought of solutions.

“Others, I’ll lure this guy toward others; maybe it will change his mind!” Chen Tiansheng decided. Though the method was underhanded, it was a solution. Even if it couldn’t change Luotian’s mind, it could slow the beast down. As long as it slowed, Chen Tiansheng would at least have a chance to breathe.

With this thought, Chen Tiansheng acted immediately. He waved his hand toward a black ring on his wrist and sent his spiritual awareness into it. Instantly, the positions of Hell ghost cultivators in this space appeared in his mind.

“Sun Menlie!” Chen Tiansheng quickly found the closest Hell ghost cultivator—Sun Menlie.

At this moment, Sun Menlie had already made up his mind not to provoke Luotian. He was too terrifying, and he was secretly happy that the ghost beast had targeted Luotian and relentlessly chased him.

Chapter 2046: I Am the Most ()

The towering black pillar pierced through heaven and earth. Within it stood a black palace. Outside the pillar, figures stood there—those who had arrived first.

“Ah, this is one of the 108 palaces of the Earth Store King’s Palace!” Their faces showed understanding. They gazed at a black stone tablet outside the pillar, which recorded some details about the Earth Store King’s Palace and its rules.

“Who kills the most will enter the inheritance realm, competing with others who also killed the most in the other 107 palaces to claim the Earth Store King’s inheritance!” They soon discovered the rules, their faces changing.

This rule was truly intriguing—no time limit and no way to record who killed how many people.

Under the influence of greed, people would likely keep killing endlessly, as no one knew how many others had killed.

They looked at each other. Except for those with close relationships, temporary teams also split up immediately because no one knew if they could trust each other.

“Kill…” Almost instantly, someone attacked those beside them, aiming to seize the chance. The scene became chaotic.

But two groups had different arrival times—Hell cultivators and those from Buxian City. The battle began immediately.

As more people arrived at the pillar, the killing range expanded from hundreds to thousands.

“Damn it, if I don’t kill, I’ll be killed!”

“There’s no choice but to kill to survive!” Almost everyone had this thought. Though they didn’t want to kill, there was no alternative. Human hearts are hidden; who knew if they would become others’ prey?

To avoid becoming prey, one had to either be the killer or strong enough to make everyone fear. Clearly, no such person existed in this space.

Those vying for the Earth Store King’s inheritance were thus ruthlessly slaughtering, as they didn’t know when it would end. They chose the fastest way to kill.

While the pillar was surrounded by continuous battles, Luotian kept running toward it. However, two figures ahead of him were gaunt and battered.

They were Chen Tiansheng and Zhang Menlie, their bodies thin as corpses, eyes lifeless but filled with intense hatred.

“Haha, you two bastards, run faster! I’ll see how long you can last!” Luotian laughed continuously as he chased them.
