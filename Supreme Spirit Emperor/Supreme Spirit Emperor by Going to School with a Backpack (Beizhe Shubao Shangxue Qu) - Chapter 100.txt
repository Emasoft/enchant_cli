Luo Tian’s face showed no trace of fear. His formidable physical body surged forward like thunder, plunging into the sea of fire.

As soon as he entered the verdant flames, Luo Tian did not feel even a hint of heat. Instead, strands of potent wood-element vital energy surged into his body.

“Die!” Yang Kaiji’s face twisted with mockery as he gazed at Luo Tian charging into the fire. He knew the power of the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame—so fearsome that it could sever even space.

Luo Tian’s actions were tantamount to self-destruction. While Danzong could control the three ancestral flames through special methods, Luo Tian had no such means. He could only rely on his will to subdue the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame, making it submit. This was an impossible task in people’s eyes.

Yet Luo Tian had his own secret weapon—the Zhen Hun Ding. Earlier, Shan Yuyan’s three thousand scorching flames had been subdued by it. However, Luo Tian’s pride made him wish to test whether he could subdue the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame with his own strength.

“Boom…” Before Luo Tian could ponder further, the wood-element energy was followed by a sudden surge of fire-element energy into his body. It erupted violently.

Luo Tian’s meridians seemed to ignite instantly, as emerald flames flowed ceaselessly through them.

“Sizzle…” Luo Tian’s body also suffered the fire’s invasion. The high-grade Xuan-tier inner armor given by his mother burned fiercely under the flames’ heat.

Luo Tian’s entire body emitted a sizzling sound from within and without, emitting a scent of charred flesh.

Fortunately, the emerald flames enveloped Luo Tian completely, obscuring his condition from those outside. Even spiritual awareness could not penetrate the flames to observe him.

“Roar!” Luo Tian let out a roar, his voice filled with unyielding determination that pierced the heavens.

“Hmph… truly seeking death! I’ll collect it once you’re completely burned to death!” Yang Kaiji’s face bore a triumphant expression as he watched Luo Tian, now resembling a human torch.

Chapter 489: The Three Thousand Weak Waters

Cold Hongcai and other disciples of Yuliling Sect watched with concern. The Blue Crystal Luminous Flame’s pressure was truly terrifying; even Cold Hongcai doubted if he could survive it. Moreover, the flames seemed to intensify further.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt as if he were burning alive. His formidable physical body gradually began to ignite.

Amidst the astonished gazes of onlookers, Luo Tian continued burning—but they sensed he had not perished. The fire-wrapped body still harbored immense vitality.

“Endure! I, Luo Tian, have never feared anyone or anything—especially this mindless flame!” Luo Tian’s inner voice roared repeatedly. Water-element vital energy spread around his body and meridians, alleviating the searing pain caused by the flames.

A mist of water vapor rose into the sky after Luo Tian unleashed his water-element energy, as if the heavens had begun to rain.

“This is no way out!” Onlookers marveled, their admiration for Luo Tian deepening. To enter such an overwhelming fire and attempt to subdue it was astonishing.

“Die! Die! I’ll collect the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame once you’re dead. Then, I’ll finish you off under cover of darkness,” Yang Kaiji muttered with murderous intent, his face contorted.

Initially, Yang Kaiji planned to retrieve the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame after Luo Tian’s death. However, he abandoned this plan upon recalling his grandson was still in Luo Tian’s grasp. If Luo Tian died, Yang Kaiji doubted whether the Naling Bag could withstand the flames’ invasion.

“One moment… two moments…”

Time passed agonizingly, yet the sky’s flames intensified further. The fire expanded from an initial hundred zhang to three hundred zhang, and even in the dark night, the entire Guangcheng and Jifeng Valley seemed illuminated like day.

The terrifying heat made some body-tempering sect disciples pale-faced and weak.

After another two moments, it had been an hour since Luo Tian entered the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame.

“Still alive!” Yang Kaiji’s face showed a flicker of astonishment. Though he sensed Luo Tian’s vitality was nearly extinguished, it clung on like a stubborn blade of grass.

“Master Zheng, please retrieve the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame!” Zheng Hongsheng finally could not hold back and addressed Yang Kaiji.

Zheng Hongsheng sighed inwardly. He had already sent messages to the sect elders, but their reply was that they would not intervene unless life or death was at stake.

Now, the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame had expanded to an astonishing eight hundred zhang. If it continued growing, it would cause catastrophic damage to Jifeng Valley.

“Hmph!” Yang Kaiji’s face twisted with disdain, returning to his haughty demeanor. He shook his head lightly.

“Master Zheng, I am truly powerless now. The Blue Crystal Luminous Flame is beyond my control,” Yang Kaiji said with a faint smile.

Seeing Yang Kaiji’s smug face, Zheng Hongsheng longed to slap him, but at present, only Yang Kaiji could stop the flames’ spread.

“Master Yang, for the sake of our good relations with Yuliling Sect, please help!” Zheng Hongsheng mentally cursed but forced a smile.

“Helping is possible, but first: cancel the wedding. Second: that big cauldron of his must be mine. Third: once he revives, have him kneel before my grandson and apologize!” Yang Kaiji coldly ordered, his eyes gleaming with triumph.

“Old bastard! You’re overstepping!” Yuliling Sect disciples glared angrily, cursing him.

“Shameless!” Danzong disciples behind Yang Kaiji even felt embarrassed.

“Yang, today I declare: Luo Tian is my Yuliling Sect’s young master. If he dies here, Yuliling and Danzong will never rest!” Cold Hongcai’s face turned icy, no longer the amiable man he once was.

Hearing Cold Hongcai’s words, everyone’s gaze shifted slightly. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to hold such a high position in Yuliling Sect. “Never rest” implied an unforgivable enmity.

Cold Hongcai had always been amiable, but now his eyes held no掩饰 of killing intent.

Feeling Cold Hongcai’s unhidden hostility, Yang Kaiji instinctively shivered. After weighing the pros and cons, he narrowed his eyes: “I’ll make a concession—let my grandson slap him three times. That’s it!”

“Three breaths, go save him; otherwise, we’ll tear this apart!” Cold Hongcai said coldly. He could sense Luo Tian’s aura had dwindled to a single thread, and if delayed further, it would be too late.

Seeing Cold Hongcai’s aggressive stance, Yang Kaiji frowned slightly. After considering the pros and cons, his eyes darkened. He nodded to Cold Hongcai.

Yang Kaiji’s heart was already filled with murderous intent. He had decided to leave Luo Tian no chance of survival, his face twisted in a cold smile as he flew toward the flames. At this moment, he was four or five hundred zhang away from Luo Tian.

“Truly an idiot!” Yang Kaiji sneered, extending his hand. A string of seals flew from it, and a single talisman landed in his palm before he hurled it into the sky.

“Woo…” The talisman emitted a humming sound upon reaching the air, and the seals Yang Kaiji had cast also slowly ascended to meet it.

Upon contact with Yang Kaiji’s talisman, the seals emitted a soft blue glow, momentarily diluting the scorching heat of the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame.

As if unlocking a seal, a single deep-blue droplet appeared above the fire sea. Surprisingly, this one drop of water did not dissipate despite the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame’s terrifying heat.

“Rippling… rippling…” Upon the droplet’s appearance, people felt it seemed to surpass even the ocean’s might, producing a roaring sound of waves.

“The Three Thousand Weak Waters!” No one expected Danzong to possess such an item; no wonder they could subdue the three ancestral flames.

Hearing people’s murmurs, Yang Kaiji’s face bore a proud expression. The Three Thousand Weak Waters’ value was no less than that of the three ancestral flames.

“Subdue it!” Yang Kaiji barked, his spiritual energy surging to command the droplet in the sky.

“One… two…” As Yang Kaiji’s words fell, the Three Thousand Weak Waters seemed to split apart, forming three thousand droplets. Each carried an intense water-element aura and slowly pressed toward the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame.

Chapter 490: Rebirth in Flames

Amidst the astonished gazes of onlookers, three thousand droplets pressed toward the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame as if encountering a natural enemy. Their movement was slow.

The emerald flames seemed to sense the presence of the Three Thousand Weak Waters and abruptly halted, quickly retracting from nearly a thousand zhang to five hundred.

“Truly effective!” Zheng Hongsheng and others smiled with relief.

Water and fire were natural opposites, representing the extremes of nature’s elements. Now they met, both cautious and careful.

Yang Kaiji smiled, his aged palm lifting slightly before he forcefully pressed downward.

As Yang Kaiji’s hand fell, the three thousand droplets seemed to obey a command, their speed suddenly increasing as they rushed toward the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame.

“This is a clash between two extremes of nature! Legends say each drop of the Three Thousand Weak Waters contains the power of an entire northern sea. Who will prevail between them?” Duan Chenfeng’s gaze was filled with admiration and awe at Danzong’s depth.

But just as the droplets and flames were about to touch, a surge of vitality suddenly erupted from Luo Tian.

People’s eyes saw Luo Tian’s vitality rapidly recover, returning to his original state within a blink.

“This…” Zheng Hongsheng and others gaped, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian in astonishment. They hadn’t expected him to recover from such a dire situation.

“Rebirth in flames! Could it be that this boy has grasped the essence of fire?” Cold Hongcai was stunned, his gaze turning to Luo Tian who had just opened his eyes.

“Return!” A cold voice, like a thunderclap, echoed in people’s ears.

Before the voice finished, the three thousand droplets halted their descent and swiftly flew upward.

Luo Tian’s face bore a smile as he whispered, “So this is rebirth in flames?”

Luo Tian extended his hand. The surrounding Blue Crystal Luminous Flames seemed to flow like water, wrapping around his palm with a sense of familiarity.

“From now on, you are my life-fire. As long as you live, I shall not perish!” Luo Tian sighed softly, biting his tongue to spit a stream of blood onto the emerald flames.

Luo Tian quickly retrieved a long robe from the fire and put it on, then laughed aloud. He took a deep breath, drawing the emerald flames into his mouth.

“Woo…” The emerald fire sea rushed toward Luo Tian’s mouth, drawn in by his breath.

“This!” People stared at Luo Tian’s actions, their gazes stunned. They couldn’t fathom how he had done it.

“Haha, this kid! Truly terrifying!” Cold Hongcai chuckled, watching the normally composed Leng Qiuchan’s expression shift slightly before he shook his head.

“Five hundred zhang… three hundred zhang…”

In a few breaths, the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame—once arrogant and troublesome to Zheng Hongsheng and others—drifted into Luo Tian’s body, forming a green flame that floated in his dantian.

“Little brat! You dare to defy me and reclaim my ancestral flame!” At this point, even a fool would understand what had happened.

“Luo Tian has truly succeeded!”

“Young Master’s might!” Yuliling Sect disciples’ faces lit up with fervor, shouting loudly.

“Old dog! You’re no longer a threat to me!” Luo Tian sneered, watching Yang Kaiji approaching. His emerald flames spread out, a dragon of fire suddenly surged toward Yang Kaiji.

“This water droplet is quite good. Thank you!” Luo Tian laughed, casting a string of seals onto the droplets. He闪身 swiftly to the Three Thousand Weak Waters, his hand reaching out to grasp it and seal it into a jade bottle.

Seeing Luo Tian’s actions, Yang Kaiji nearly spat out his old blood, his face filled with indescribable anger. Yet he knew now that he must tread carefully against Luo Tian. Though he was at the late Yuanling stage, Luo Tian’s possession of the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame made him impossible to judge by ordinary standards.

Luo Tian’s face bore confidence, his power now immense. Not only had he been refined by the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame and mastered fire’s essence, but as long as the flame endured, he would not perish. Rebirth in flames combined with the formidable destructive power of the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame made Luo Tian fully capable of challenging a late Yuanling.

Seeing Yang Kaiji locked in battle with the fire dragon, Luo Tian smiled and waved his hand, releasing Yang Hongguang. He kicked Yang Kaiji to the ground, then sent another fire dragon to encircle both of them.

“Luo Tian! Today’s grudge, Danzong will remember. Yuliling Sect, wait for Danzong’s wrath!” Yang Kaiji caught Yang Hongguang and glared with a twisted expression.

“Hmph, can you represent Danzong?” Luo Tian sneered.

“Good! Can you represent Danzong?” A loud, cheerful voice echoed from afar. A middle-aged man with a sword-like brow wore a blue robe that fluttered in the wind, his face cold and unyielding as he flew toward them.

Multicolored wings appeared in the distance, accompanied by a thunderous sound of breaking through the air. A figure flashed into view.

“Father…” Shan Yuyan heard the voice and her face lit up with excitement, instantly flying into the air like a young swallow toward the man.

“Ah… you’ve already become a married person, yet still so childish!” The man smiled affectionately, gently patting Shan Yuyan’s head.

“Master Shan, how have you been?” Zheng Hongsheng smiled with a hint of bitterness, glancing at the grandfather and grandson wrapped in emerald flames.

Master Shan Yufu didn’t even glance at the two, his face showing a slight smile as he nodded to Zheng Hongsheng, Cold Hongcai, and Duan Chenfeng: “Apologies for the trouble caused. Danzong’s management was inadequate.”

Hearing Master Shan Yufu’s words, Zheng Hongsheng and others nodded inwardly. This was the demeanor of a sect leader.

“Master Sect Leader, save me!” Yang Kaiji saw Master Shan Yufu arrive and his heart trembled with hope, but Master Shan Yufu seemed to ignore him, continuing to chat with the others.

During this conversation, Luo Tian approached Zheng Xin and returned Shan Yuyan’s three thousand scorching flames.

Seeing Shan Yuyan absorb the three thousand scorching flames, Master Shan Yufu’s eyes brightened. He had received a message from Shan Yuyan saying she had refined the three thousand scorching flames. Now, seeing it with his own eyes, he felt delighted.

“I came to attend my daughter’s wedding. I just had some matters delaying me!” Master Shan Yufu said coldly, his gaze turning to the grandfather and grandson entangled in the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame.

Chapter 491: Uncle Sect Leader

With Master Shan Yufu’s arrival, Danzong’s authority shifted to him. The disciples of Danzong seemed like wilted cabbages, hanging their heads behind him.

“Master Shan’s arrival is good. These past days were quite chaotic,” Zheng Hongsheng smiled, relieved.

At this moment, Yang Kaiji finally escaped the emerald flames and approached with a respectful expression.

“Master Sect Leader, this boy has stolen my Danzong’s Blue Crystal Luminous Flame. I hope you can retrieve it!” Yang Kaiji’s face bore resentment, shifting the blame to Luo Tian.

As Yang Kaiji’s words ended, the atmosphere grew tense again. People turned their gazes toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood calmly, a faint smile on his face as he gazed at Master Shan Yufu. He stepped out from Zheng Xin’s side, weaving through the crowd with a respectful bow: “Disciple pays homage to Uncle Sect Leader!”

“Uncle Sect Leader?”

“What?” People couldn’t believe their ears, unsure where Luo Tian had derived this title.

“Haha! Good child, truly worthy of my elder brother’s half-student. Excellent, excellent!” Master Shan Yufu laughed heartily, helping Luo Tian up with a smile.

“How is your elder brother doing?” Master Shan Yufu’s face showed nostalgia as he asked Luo Tian softly.

“Master Lu is quite vigorous. I heard my elder brother mention he has advanced to the Yuanling stage and his alchemy skills have improved, reaching a seven-star alchemist!” Luo Tian explained to the confused crowd.

“Who is this? How come Luo Tian, who was Yuliling Sect’s young master, has connections with Danzong!” Not only were the people confused, but Zheng Hongsheng and others were equally puzzled.

Luo Tian smiled and explained to Cold Hongcai and others. It turned out that Master Lu Kunpeng had once left Danzong to join the Five Elements Sect in the Northern Region.

When Zhang Ziping came to the Eastern Region, he had mentioned that Master Lu Kunpeng’s younger brother was a disciple of Danzong named Shan Yufu. He even gave Luo Tian a portrait of Shan Yufu. Luo Tian hadn’t expected that Shan Yufu had now become a sect leader, so he only recognized him upon seeing his face.

Although Master Lu Kunpeng had left Danzong, he maintained contact with his younger brother and teacher. Moreover, Luo Tian’s fame in the Northern Region and even the Tianyuan Continent was well-known. The news of the Five Elements Sect’s Five-Element Body would naturally reach Danzong.

“Good child, excellent! My elder brother is fortunate to have you as a junior!” Master Shan Yufu smiled, pulling Luo Tian close and looking at him with increasing satisfaction.

Hearing the relationship between Luo Tian and Master Shan Yufu, Cold Hongcai and others felt at ease, their faces lighting up with joy.

“As for the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame, don’t worry. I’ve already consulted Danzong’s elders—my elder brother and my teacher—and this flame is given as a gift for your meeting!” Master Shan Yufu spoke calmly, saying something astonishing.

Luo Tian scratched his head, a bashful expression on his face. He disliked soft words most of all, especially since this person was Master Lu Kunpeng’s younger brother and his elder.

Hearing Master Shan Yufu casually giving the precious Blue Crystal Luminous Flame as a gift, people’s faces showed shock. However, they soon marveled at Danzong’s wealth. The title of the richest sect on the Tianyuan Continent was indeed well-earned.

“Master Sect Leader, did you get approval from the elders? I object!” Yang Kaiji’s face twisted with anger. He had expected Master Shan Yufu to cause a complete rift, but instead, this was the outcome.

“Smack… go!” Master Shan Yufu turned around, his face darkened, and he slapped Yang Kaiji’s face.

“Puke…” Yang Kaiji hadn’t spat blood even when Luo Tian had beaten him, but under Master Shan Yufu’s slap, he spat blood.

“Soul-Subjugation Stage! Master Shan, you’ve reached the Soul-Subjugation Stage!” Cold Hongcai and others gasped, their gazes changing.

“Old fool! You’ve always relied on your position as Danzong’s Grand Elder, acting high and mighty. Do you think I don’t know?” Master Shan Yufu ignored the stunned gazes around him and shouted.

“Master Sect Leader!” Yang Kaiji saw Master Shan Yufu had advanced to the Soul-Subjugation Stage, his face filled with fear.

“Did it surprise you? Do you think I wouldn’t come to this wedding because of something else? Do you think I’d stay at the Yuanling Peak forever? Do you know what your little tricks were back then? I’ve endured you for years! Today, I’ll publicly investigate you before so many sects!” Master Shan Yufu’s face bore a cold expression.

Yang Kaiji was now completely trembling. Master Shan Yufu’s words seemed to imply something, but Yang Kaiji knew it clearly.

Master Shan Yufu had been a prodigy since his youth, rising to prominence in Danzong. He was the youngest ever to enter the Yuanling Stage since Danzong’s founding. Moreover, his alchemy skills were terrifying; he had become a five-star alchemist at twenty-five.

Such talent naturally drew resentment from certain people, especially the elders led by Yang Kaiji. These elders had conspired against Master Shan Yufu, poisoning him with a toxin that kept him at the Yuanling Peak for over a hundred years. Only after recent help from the elders had he finally broken free, and with accumulated strength, he had advanced to the Soul-Subjugation Stage.

“Enforcement Hall!” The Danzong disciples didn’t know these details, but they noticed the people behind Master Shan Yufu.

At first, they hadn’t paid attention, but when Master Shan Yufu looked at Yang Kaiji with a cold expression, their faces turned shocked.

The Enforcement Hall was a special entity within Danzong. Normally, whenever the Enforcement Hall appeared, it meant someone from Danzong would die—this had been a long-standing rule of the sect.

“Your crime of harming me has now become clear. Your accomplices have already been executed. Now, only you remain—Yang Kaiji!” Master Shan Yufu’s face was cold as he waved to the Enforcement Hall members behind him.

Chapter 492: The Wedding

“Boom…” Behind them, several Yuanling Peak disciples of Danzong rushed forward, subduing Yang Kaiji and Yang Hongguang. They were escorted to Master Shan Yufu’s presence.

“I’ve arranged for my daughter’s wedding these two days, and it’s not suitable to see bloodshed. Take them both into custody first. After Yuyan’s wedding, we’ll send them back to Danzong for execution!” Master Shan Yufu’s voice was as cold as the abyss, making people shiver.

Yang Kaiji looked like a wilted vegetable, his face showing pain. He wasn’t afraid of death, but he knew his grandson Yang Hongguang would also die with him. Even the entire Yang family would be executed, a common practice among major sects to eliminate threats—this was something Yang Kaiji couldn’t accept.

Yang Hongguang stood rigid, his face filled with disbelief as he looked at his grandfather and stammered: “Grandfather, is this true? Why did you do this?”

“Correct. If not for this, our Yang family would never have a chance to rise. I had hoped you’d marry Yuyan and become Danzong’s sect leader, but I never expected that Shan Yufu would choose to marry with Jifeng Valley instead of letting his daughter marry my granddaughter!” Yang Kaiji’s face twisted with hatred, shouting.

Hearing Yang Kaiji’s confession, Yang Hongguang looked like a dead man, his previous fighting spirit gone. He said nothing more; the series of blows had completely broken him.

The Danzong disciples looked at each other, marveling at the day’s drama. The once-arrogant grandfather and grandson now faced such a fate, leaving people in awe.

“Take them away!” Master Shan Yufu coldly ordered, his expression dark. If not for his past weakness, he would have dealt with the Yang family long ago. After all, no one could ignore those who had schemed against him for years.

Under the astonished gazes of people, Danzong’s Enforcement Hall disciples sealed the grandfather and grandson’s cultivation and took them away.

“Alright, Master Zheng, let’s discuss the wedding details. Let’s finish this matter quickly; it’s been too long!” Master Shan Yufu smiled, bowing to Zheng Hongsheng.

“Good. Everyone return to your accommodations. We’ll hold the wedding for the children these two days!” Zheng Hongsheng smiled, bowing to the surrounding people.

Luo Tian and other young disciples also gathered in groups, chatting or returning to their accommodations for rest.

“Luo Tian…” A voice made Luo Tian stop after taking a few steps, his face showing confusion.

Duan Xingchen appeared before Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan, his face showing intense desire upon seeing Leng Qiuchan: “I know I’m not your match now, and I thank you for saving me before. But one day, I’ll defeat you and take Qiuchan from your hands!”

Duan Xingchen’s words were short, but his final gaze at Leng Qiuchan was burning. Leng Qiuchan’s brows furrowed slightly.

“I’ll wait for you!” Luo Tian smiled lightly, his attitude toward Duan Xingchen having changed. He responded softly.

……

Three days later, the entire Jifeng Valley was decorated with lanterns and banners, filled with joyous atmosphere.

Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan were both heirs of their sects, and the grandeur was naturally not small. The numerous sects that had come to congratulate numbered in the tens of thousands, leaving Luo Tian speechless. He marveled at the power of both sects.

Under people’s joyous gazes, Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan ascended the platform to perform the marital rites. They officially became husband and wife under everyone’s eyes.

Leng Qiuchan, usually cold-eyed, showed tears of excitement. Both were her friends; she was genuinely happy for them and also felt a hint of envy, glancing at Luo Tian beside her.

“Hmm?” When Leng Qiuchan saw Luo Tian, her face slightly trembled.

At this moment, Luo Tian radiated a sorrowful aura. Though his gaze was on Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan, those around him could sense the sorrow and loneliness in his eyes.

Luo Tian’s thoughts were turbulent, thinking of Gu Qianxue in the Southern Region and Chen Yuting, who had died and was unknown if she could revive. The thought of their distant reunion filled him with sorrow.

“What’s wrong?” Leng Qiuchan asked gently, concern in her voice.

“Nothing!” Luo Tian replied faintly, his face showing determination before returning to normal.

Under the congratulations of people around them, Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan finally completed the complex ceremony and began to visit tables.

They only visited a few important ones, such as the masters’ table and some promising young disciples.

Zheng Xin soon turned red-faced, approaching Luo Tian and patting his shoulder: “Brother, thank you. I’m not being nosy, but you should settle your matters soon!”

Zheng Xin’s breath smelled of alcohol, which he sprayed on Luo Tian. After speaking, his gaze subtly glanced at Leng Qiuchan.

Hearing Zheng Xin’s look, the face under Leng Qiuchan’s black veil turned slightly red. Her eyes showed anticipation toward Luo Tian.

Others at the same table also had a curious expression, looking at Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan. In their eyes, it was only a matter of time before they became a couple.

Luo Tian helped Zheng Xin up, took out a cup of wine, and clinked it with him before drinking it all. Then he stood up and walked out.

The atmosphere at this table became subtle, with people looking at Leng Qiuchan sitting there.

“Look what? Eat properly!” Leng Qiuchan coldly muttered, her voice trembling slightly. Her mind involuntarily recalled the woman surrounded by lightning at the Wind and Thunder Platform.

Leng Qiuchan stood up, glared fiercely at Zheng Xin, then chased after Luo Tian.

Zheng Xin seemed unaware and continued to chat with people. Only Shan Yuyan, with a concerned gaze, watched the direction they left.

Luo Tian walked through Jifeng Valley with a melancholic expression. He had decided to return to the Northern Region after Zheng Xin’s wedding, to pay respects to Chen Yuting and then enter seclusion in the Five Elements Sect. He would wait for the opening of the Ancient Ruins and then go to the Yiming Sect!

The more he walked, the more determined his eyes became. As he walked, he suddenly stopped, and Leng Qiuchan’s figure appeared in his vision. This made him feel a bitter sorrow.

At this moment, Luo Tian was afraid to meet Leng Qiuchan. He had reflected on their recent experiences and felt that Leng Qiuchan truly had feelings for him. This made Luo Tian unsure how to face her.

“Luo Tian! That comment from Zheng Xin… don’t take it seriously. He…” Leng Qiuchan looked at Luo Tian with concern.

Seeing Leng Qiuchan’s worried gaze, Luo Tian felt a warmth in his heart but was hesitant to meet her eyes. He nodded slightly and gave a soft “hmm.”

“Let’s walk a bit,” Leng Qiuchan said softly, her eyes showing hesitation as if making a decision.

“Qiuchan… I’m sorry!” Luo Tian spoke softly, knowing his sudden departure would have embarrassed Leng Qiuchan.

Leng Qiuchan suddenly rushed to Luo Tian’s front, her eyes showing determination. Her hand lifted slightly and gently removed the veil from her face.

Leng Qiuchan’s action left Luo Tian speechless. Then, his face showed curiosity. Since he met Leng Qiuchan, he had never seen her true face. Now that she was removing it herself, Luo Tian naturally didn’t stop her.

The black veil fell, revealing a pale face before Luo Tian’s eyes. His vision brightened, and his heart trembled.

“Beautiful… so beautiful!” Luo Tian’s first impression was beauty, even unsure what words to use to describe Leng Qiuchan.

Luo Tian considered himself having seen many beauties, but none were as beautiful as Leng Qiuchan. At this moment, she was perfect in his eyes.

Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. Seeing Luo Tian frozen, Leng Qiuchan smiled and gently replaced the black veil: “Let’s go.”

Leng Qiuchan’s words made Luo Tian snap out of his trance. He was puzzled by why she had suddenly done this.

But Luo Tian didn’t want to say much, so he nodded. His mind still held the image of Leng Qiuchan’s stunning beauty.

They walked without saying a word, each returning to their accommodations. The Jifeng Valley remained joyous and festive, showing no signs of stopping its celebration.

The next day, the third day, until the third day later, people gradually left, leaving only major sects behind.

By the seventh day, these major sects also departed one by one, leaving only three sects and Danzong.

At dawn, three thunderous dragon roars echoed in people’s ears, and the massive bodies of flying dragons appeared in the sky, blocking the morning light.

“Huff…” Wind surged as three massive flying dragons landed on the ground, seemingly waiting for the three groups of people.

“Master Leng, Master Duan, I’ll bid you farewell!” Zheng Hongsheng smiled, his mood lifted after finalizing his son’s marriage.

Then Zheng Hongsheng turned his gaze to Luo Tian: “Luo Tian, if you have time in the future, feel free to visit Jifeng Valley. If there’s trouble, don’t hesitate to seek me out. I can’t say much about other places, but in the Eastern Region, no one dares to ignore Jifeng Valley’s face!”

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian inwardly frowned. He thought of the scheming during his match with Yang Hongguang and felt some irritation, but he kept a respectful expression.

Thinking of that match, Luo Tian’s face darkened and he looked coldly at the one elder behind Zheng Hongsheng.

On the third day of Zheng Xin’s wedding, a disciple from Jifeng Valley reported that Yang Kaiji and his grandson had escaped.

To be honest, they were sealed in cultivation and their treasures taken. Even a body-tempering disciple could guard them, but the two disciples who had guarded them—of the bone-subjugation stage—had been poisoned. Yang Kaiji and his grandson had vanished without a trace.
