" What do you think you're doing! " Seeing Zi Mo approaching, Yu Letian instantly leapt behind Li Xuelong, his eyes filled with terror, recalling the terrifying moment before.

" You all attack him together and kill this kid! " Yu Letian suddenly remembered he had brought many people, and quickly shouted orders.

" Yes! " Hearing Yu Letian's words, the few men exchanged a bitter smile. Their cultivation levels made them unable to perceive their opponent's strength, clearly far superior.

" Zi Mo, don't be so reckless! Get out of here! " Li Xuelong gritted his teeth and took a step toward Zi Mo.

But as soon as he stepped forward, a streak of violet lightning struck in front of Li Xuelong. Diao Dedu's eyes carried mockery: "Li Xuelong, you'd better stay here and watch the show!"

" You... " Seeing Diao Dedu's speed, Li Xuelong's face changed abruptly. An unprecedented pressure radiated from Diao Dedu's body, sending waves of terror through Li Xuelong's mind.

" How is this possible! " Li Xuelong realized he couldn't move. With his half-step Epoch cultivation, the only one who could exert such overwhelming pressure was an Epoch-level master.

" You bastard! Take off your clothes and give them to me! " Diao Dedu eyed Yu Letian's white sable robe with cold indifference.

" Boom... " As Diao Dedu's words fell, Gu Guanyu and Zheng Tianyao appeared before Yu Letian, pinning him to the ground and starting to strip his clothes.

Meanwhile, Zi Mo also launched a punch at a youth of Mid-Saint level.

Chapter 1411: Final Decision

" Boom... " After the punch, the young man's face showed shock. He was sent flying backward, colliding with an icy mountain and buried under a cascade of snow.

" This... " The remaining youths showed shock, watching the young man swallowed by snow. They held high positions in Han Tian Sect and were all prodigies, with this young man ranking among the top ten. Now he was helpless against Zi Mo's punch, exceeding everyone's expectations.

" I said you're trash, but you didn't believe me! " Zi Mo's eyes carried mockery. His aura surged as he took another step forward, launching another punch.

This time it targeted the strongest youth of Late-Saint level. The result was unsurprising - the young man spat blood and flew backward.

" Attack! " Though shocked by Zi Mo's strength, the remaining youths had no choice but to charge forward.

Zi Mo flew toward another Late-Saint level youth, wanting Li Xuelong to witness his power - far superior to these Han Tian Sect trash. He also wanted to show Li Qian'nan his ability to protect her, and let Luo Tian see this was his disciple - invincible among peers.

But soon Zi Mo was stunned. In the blink of an eye, he clashed with that Late-Saint level youth.

However, as their fists met, the young man was sent flying backward, spitting blood and looking weak. He collided with an icy mountain and gazed at Zi Mo.

" Hmm? " Zi Mo felt puzzled but soon another attack came, forcing him to turn and punch.

" Ah... " A scream echoed. The youth who attacked Zi Mo also spat blood, eyes filled with disbelief.

" Damn it! " Zi Mo cursed inwardly, finally understanding their intentions. He kicked off the ground and appeared before the third youth, his hand descending.

" Damned! " The youth's face darkened. Without hesitation, he fled with all his might, managing to escape just before Zi Mo's hand fell. In his flight, he even forced out a streak of blood, colliding with the icy mountain.

Third... Fourth...

Zi Mo continuously rushed toward them, but none dared to fight back. They fled straight into the icy mountain, spitting blood.

" Kid, are these the people you brought? " Gu Guanyu and Zheng Tianyao had already stripped Yu Letian's sable robe.

To everyone's amusement, Yu Letian was wearing nothing but a red belly band. The bright red made it extremely noticeable, leaving Luo Tian and others speechless.

" What a dirty bastard! " Dong Yan'er's face turned red, covering Dang Yichen's eyes.

" He really has character! " Zheng Tianyao kicked Yu Letian to the ground, sealing his cultivation.

" This little guy has so many wives. How many can he satisfy? I think I saw a green mist floating above his head! " Gu Guanyu glanced at Yu Letian.

" You bastard! Don't you see Yan'er is here? " Luo Tian slapped Gu Guanyu's head.

Luo Tian was really exasperated with Gu Guanyu. It seemed like this kid had absorbed all their flaws - irreverent, talkative, and fond of showing off. He had no redeeming qualities at all!

Yu Letian's cultivation was sealed, wearing only a red belly band. He lay shivering on the icy ground, his lips turning purple as he trembled, watching his companions lying nearby.

" Can you guys act more convincingly! " Yu Letian cursed inwardly, his eyes filled with resentment toward Gu Guanyu and Zheng Tianyao.

" Who are you... " Li Xuelong, under the immense pressure from Diao Dedu, couldn't move. His eyes were filled with terror as he looked at Luo Tian, now even beginning to believe these people were indeed Luo Tian.

Although Zi Mo had only fought twice, his strength was clearly at the peak of Mid-Saint level.

" I'm Luo Tian. Do you believe me now? " Luo Tian smiled, addressing Li Xuelong with a tone of authority that shook Li Xuelong's spirit.

The disciples and elders of Snow Dragon Mountain stared in shock at Luo Tian's group. They hadn't expected such a situation within moments.

" You... you'll regret this! I'm the heir of Han Tian Sect. In this Han Tian continent, if you offend me, you won't be able to leave! " Yu Letian's teeth chattered as he looked at Luo Tian's group, issuing a threat.

" Uncle, we are indeed from the Four Sacred Star Regions. We've come to Lei Region for some business, so we concealed our identities! " Zi Mo addressed Li Xuelong with sincerity.

" Boom... " Just as Zi Mo's words ended, one of the youths lying under the icy mountain pulled out a token and crushed it.

" That's my Han Tian Sect token. Wait and see, my sect has an early Epoch-level ancestor. When he comes, you'll wish for death but won't get it! " Yu Letian's eyes showed a sinister expression as he addressed Luo Tian's group.

" You've caused great trouble! " Li Xuelong's face darkened as he looked at Luo Tian's group, still skeptical.

" Li Xuelong, what do you mean? If you don't give me an explanation, there's no need for Snow Dragon Sect to exist! " As Li Xuelong's words ended, a authoritative voice followed, and several figures materialized from nowhere. Their eyes scanned Gu Guanyu's feet where Yu Letian, now frozen in ice, lay, and the several figures lying under the icy mountain.

" Father... save me! " Yu Letian's weak voice rose from Gu Guanyu's feet, making the middle-aged man's killing intent more intense.

" You dare! " The middle-aged man instantly exploded with rage, his half-step Epoch cultivation radiating overwhelming coldness. His hand descended heavily toward Gu Guanyu.

" You have a father, I have an aunt! Auntie save me... " Gu Guanyu's loud voice startled Luo Tian.

" Slap... " Luo Tian ignored the deadly cold hand and slapped Gu Guanyu's head: " What are you yapping about! "

" Get lost... " Luo Tian finally showed impatience, letting out a light哼. The massive hand that had shaken the heavens shattered above Luo Tian's head, dispersing into swirling coldness that spread outward.

" One punch and the attack from a half-step Epoch master was directly dispelled! " The people of Snow Dragon Mountain showed shock, watching Luo Tian.

" You! " The middle-aged man's face was also filled with amazement. He hadn't expected Luo Tian, who looked harmless, to be so formidable.

" You immediately wanted to kill my junior! " Luo Tian smiled, looking at the middle-aged man as he stepped toward Yu Letian, smiling and stepping on his body.

" Boom... " Blood rose from Luo Tian's feet. Then Luo Tian's aura surged, his power reaching the heavens - an Epoch-level Mid-Stage, supreme to Li Xuelong's eyes.

" Hum... " Not only that, Diao Dedu, Wan Lingkong, and Sun Kemin's auras also surged suddenly. Their overwhelming pressure instantly shook the entire Snow Dragon Mountain.

" Boom... boom... boom... " The middle-aged man and his group, who had been so high above before, fell from the sky, crashing onto the ground with eyes filled with terror.

" Hmm? " Four powerful auras spread throughout the entire Han Tian Continent, causing an old man seated in Han Tian Sect to open his eyes instantly. His eyes were filled with shock, and he vanished from Han Tian Sect in a flash.

" You... you... " Everyone was speechless, looking at Luo Tian with expressions of disbelief.

" Now do you believe I'm Luo Tian? " Luo Tian walked toward Li Xuelong, still smiling.

" Believed... believed... " Li Xuelong's heart was terrified. He recalled the words he had said about Luo Tian before, his eyes trembling.

In the nine regions, few people possessed an Epoch-level Mid-Stage cultivation. They were all regional masters. Who would dare to impersonate?

Li Xuelong never expected Luo Tian to come to their insignificant Snow Dragon Sect. Looking at the bloodstains under Luo Tian's feet, Li Xuelong trembled. He knew this master had destroyed a sacred sect before. Destroying Snow Dragon Sect would be as easy as blowing.

" Old man, you just said you wanted to kneel and beg for marriage. Now... " Gu Guanyu's face showed confidence, standing beside Luo Tian. He didn't want to miss this chance to show off. But before he could finish his words, Luo Tian slapped him back.

" Now, I suppose Master Li has no more doubts? " Luo Tian smiled gently, not wanting Li Xuelong to lose face.

" None left! " At this moment, Li Xuelong dared not argue. Luo Tian's personal visit for marriage was a rare opportunity. If it were known, Snow Dragon Sect's status in the nine regions would be renowned. Such a good opportunity was what Li Xuelong had long desired, and others would rush to seek Luo Tian's favor.

" Since that's the case, let's settle this first. I came in a hurry and didn't bring much. Let me take out two pseudo-Epoch Treasures as marriage gifts! " Luo Tian waved his hand, and two pseudo-Epoch Treasures fell before Li Xuelong. The people of Snow Dragon Mountain immediately stared with wide eyes.

Chapter 1412: Lei Sea Marsh

" Pseudo-Epoch Treasures! " The people of Snow Dragon Mountain looked at the two treasures, their eyes filled with intense desire.

Snow Dragon Sect was a major sect in Han Tian Continent but only possessed one pseudo-Epoch Treasure, which they treasured. Now Luo Tian casually produced two, making the people of Snow Dragon Sect overjoyed.

" My disciple's marriage requires no shame. I promise to refine three batches of sacred-grade elixirs for Snow Dragon Sect, even sacred-grade ones. These elixirs will also be part of the marriage gifts! " Luo Tian waved his hand, sending a storage bag to Li Xuelong's hands. His eyes carried an air of nonchalance.

" This... this... " Li Xuelong received the storage bag, his heart shaking. He looked at Luo Tian with increasing shame and redness on his face.

" Thank you, Master Luo! " Li Xuelong said and immediately knelt. Although Luo Tian was younger than him, he deserved this bow for any reason.

Li Xuelong knew his previous actions were all out of consideration for his daughter. Luo Tian had not held it against him.

" Never mind, Master Li, you're family now. If Snow Dragon Sect doesn't want to stay in Han Tian Continent, it can choose to go to the Four Sacred Star Regions! " Luo Tian wouldn't let Li Xuelong truly kneel. He lifted him up with a smile.

The disciples of Snow Dragon Sect looked at Luo Tian with burning eyes. His legend was known to all in the nine regions. Now they had finally seen Luo Tian, how could these young disciples not be excited?

" Han Tian Sect, Mu Hantian didn't know Master Luo was coming. Please forgive him! " A deep voice echoed from the sky, and an old figure appeared in people's sight. This was the strongest person of Han Tian Continent, Mu Hantian.

Mu Hantian didn't descend from the sky but walked up step by step. His eyes showed a touch of respect as he came out from among Snow Dragon Sect's disciples and approached Luo Tian, bowing to him. He hadn't seen the stunned Mu Wending, the Han Tian Sect's sect master who had just attacked Gu Guanyu.

" Those who don't know are not to be blamed. Master Luo came to Han Tian Continent and disturbed Mu Hantian's cultivation, please don't take it personally! " Luo Tian looked at Mu Hantian and lightly bowed. Since Mu Hantian was so polite, Luo Tian naturally wouldn't be rude.

" It's over! " Mu Wending stood there, his heart trembling. Seeing his sect's elder being so polite to Luo Tian without even looking at him, he knew his fate was out of his hands.

" How did this killer end up in this desolate Han Tian Continent! " Mu Wending's face was extremely dark. He cursed himself for not taking Luo Tian seriously.

" Master Luo, what business do you have in our Han Tian Continent? " Mu Hantian smiled and asked Luo Tian.

" My disciple and Snow Dragon Sect's disciple are in love. As a master, I came to propose for my disciple. Unexpectedly, I met Han Tian Sect's sect master and his heir. There were some unpleasant incidents! " Luo Tian smiled playfully, looking at Mu Wending and other Han Tian Sect elders trembling.

" My god, he really is Luo Tian! " The few Han Tian Sect prodigies who had just climbed out of the snow mountain saw Luo Tian and were shocked.

" That's really Zi Mo, the one who killed countless Saint Clan prodigies from the Demon Region! " Their hearts were filled with shock.

" I'm lucky I was smart! " The few pretending to be injured looked at the two still buried under the snow mountain, sighing inwardly.

" You bastard! " Mu Hantian looked at Luo Tian's playful expression and his face turned angry. He swung his hand and slapped Mu Wending across the face, almost splitting his head.

" You all dare to offend! Even Luo Tian! Your mother, I might end up dying here! " Mu Hantian cursed inwardly. His face was furious, and before Mu Wending could react, his hand fell again on Mu Wending's face.

" Slap... slap... " Mu Hantian was truly angry. Luo Tian was now at the peak of his power, and all the sacred sects from various regions were crushed by him.

" You're really overstepping, Han Tian Sect. You'll end up destroying your sect! " Mu Hantian cursed while beating, finally breaking Mu Wending into pieces. He took a deep breath and turned to look at Luo Tian.

" Master Luo, it was my fault in managing the sect. I hope you won't hold it against me! " Mu Hantian smiled and spoke gently.

" Master Mu is too polite. Let's let it go. As for this kid, please manage him well from now on! " Luo Tian grabbed a gray soul essence and held it in his hand, which was Yu Letian's soul.

" Thank you. I'll strictly manage him! " Mu Hantian sighed and took Yu Letian's weak soul into his hands.

" Also, Snow Dragon Sect hopes Master Mu will take care of it. I'll remember this favor! "

" Of course, if Snow Dragon Sect has anyone who disappears unexpectedly in the future, I won't forget. I believe Master Mu will understand the pros and cons! " Luo Tian spoke gently, looking at Mu Hantian. He believed Master Mu would consider the pros and cons.

" Don't worry! From today on, Snow Dragon Sect will be equal to Han Tian Sect in the Han Tian Continent! " Mu Hantian quickly bowed, looking at Li Xuelong with even a touch of envy. This was now connected to Luo Tian.

" I also need to discuss the marriage matters with Master Li. I won't keep Master Mu any longer! " Luo Tian bowed to Mu Hantian and didn't want to talk more.

" Then I'll take my leave. If Master Luo has time, you can visit Han Tian! " Mu Hantian bowed to Luo Tian and disappeared with the reborn Mu Wending and Han Tian Sect's people from Snow Dragon Sect's view.

Luo Tian had performed soul-searching on Yu Letian. Yu Letian was a typical second-generation noble, lustful and greedy with many concubines. But such people were common in the cultivation world. Luo Tian had met many, like Fu Xingyue from Star Moon Divine Clan who also had many concubines.

At least, Luo Tian didn't think Yu Letian was worth dying for. Mu Hantian was an early Epoch-level master, and his strength wasn't weak. Luo Tian had given him a face, so if Mu Hantian was sensible, he would understand his intention.

" A meteoric rise! " Li Xuelong and Snow Dragon Sect's people, hearing Luo Tian and Mu Hantian's conversation, felt their hearts surge. They knew from today on, Snow Dragon Sect would definitely rise meteorically and revere Luo Tian more.

With the support of Four Sacred Star Regions, Snow Dragon Sect would likely leave Han Tian Continent and appear in the nine regions' view.

" Thank you, Master! " Zi Mo, filled with gratitude, brought Li Qian'nan to Luo Tian's side and bowed.

" Come on, get up! " Luo Tian smiled and helped Zi Mo and Li Qian'nan up. His eyes scanned Li Qian'nan, then waved his hand to produce a pseudo-Epoch Treasure's feather robe. This was one he had taken from the treasure vault in Star Moon Divine Clan, intending to give it as a gift to his four wives. Now he thought it was difficult to distribute, so he gave it to Li Qian'nan as a welcome gift.

" Thank you, Master! " Li Qian'nan's face was shy. Under Zi Mo's signal, she took the robe.

" Uncle! Are there any more pseudo-Epoch Treasures? Give me a few to protect myself! " Gu Guanyu licked his lips and approached Luo Tian, his eyes showing greed.

" Damn it! You're treating my treasures like a treasure vault. There's none left. Go bother your Uncle Sun instead; he has more good things! " Luo Tian was speechless, shouting at Gu Guanyu. He really had no pseudo-Epoch Treasures left except for the Splitting Heaven Spear and Seven Star Thunder Vase.

" Get lost... " Sun Kemin, hearing Luo Tian's words, immediately had a dark face. He thought of when Luo Tian had stripped him down to his pants.

" Ha ha! " Diao Dedu and others all laughed, naturally having heard about the incident.

" Alright, let's discuss the marriage matters of these two kids! " Luo Tian looked at Li Xuelong, who was very cautious, and spoke gently.

" Yes! Yes! Yes! " Li Xuelong quickly nodded, not daring to delay. He led everyone into a large hall.

Marriage matters were naturally meaningless; it was just about setting a date. Some details, Luo Tian's conditions made Snow Dragon Sect extremely satisfied.

Luo Tian and his group stayed one night in Snow Dragon Sect. The next day, they left Snow Dragon Sect and flew out of Han Tian Continent.

However, they later hid their forms and lurked in Han Tian Continent for several days. After finding out that Han Tian Sect had no intention of dealing with Snow Dragon Sect, and even showed intent to elevate it, they finally left Han Tian Continent towards the Lei Sea Marsh.

After flying through the stars for two days, they finally arrived at the vast and endless Lei Sea Marsh, the first battlefield of the great battle against the Demon Region.

Furious thunder stretched endlessly, forming a terrifying sea of lightning. Even Luo Tian with his Mid-Stage Epoch cultivation felt immense pressure in this terrifying thunder sea.

Looking at the endless thunder sea, Luo Tian remembered seeing the seal connecting to the nine regions in Star Moon Divine Clan. The other end of the seal was definitely the Lei Sea Marsh.

" If possible, check how the seal to Star Moon Divine Clan is! " Luo Tian sighed softly, his eyes filled with nostalgia.

Chapter 1413: Thunder Slave

The Lei Sea Marsh was vast, and Luo Tian's group stood there, gazing at the endless sea of thunder. Their hearts trembled.

Although it was known as one of the nine deadly places, if you were on the periphery, this terrifying thunder power wouldn't be so strong. Some body cultivators would come here to refine their bodies, achieving unexpected results.

" Let's go! " Luo Tian's group didn't draw attention. They looked like ordinary adventurers.

" The entire periphery of the thunder sea was filled with cultivators. Each strong figure sat in the thunder sea, and each thunder power continuously struck their bodies.

But as time passed, the figures Luo Tian saw became fewer and fewer. Their eyes carried a hint of smiles.

" Can't take it anymore? " Luo Tian turned around, looking at the young generation. They had advanced nearly ten thousand zhang, and those who could reach here weren't simple.

" I can still go for a while! Not yet my limit! " Dong Yichen's face was drenched in sweat. Thunder power continuously struck the young faces, making his face show pain.

" Heh, good kid! " Luo Tian patted Dong Yichen's shoulder. Among the young disciples, he liked this one most because he saw his own reflection in him.

The other young generation followed closely behind Dong Yichen, saying nothing. Their faces were serious.

After advancing another five thousand zhang, Luo Tian saw the young generation stop. He spoke gently: " Alright, you can refine your bodies here. It will definitely help you grow a lot."

" Hum... " A series of waves flew from Wan Lingkong's hands, and then a group of golden array flags surrounded the young people.

" Boom... " As the array was formed, the terrifying thunder power seemed to be guided and converged toward the array. Dong Yichen and others gritted their teeth.

" Enjoy it well! I'll come back for you! You kids are too much!" Diao Dedu laughed and exchanged glances with Luo Tian. Then he vanished into the depths of the thunder sea.

" Damn it! These old guys!" Gu Guanyu was struck by a bolt of lightning, watching Luo Tian's group disappear. He cursed under his breath.

" Hehe, my father seems to have forgotten me! This array is nothing for me!" Luo Li smiled mischievously and rushed toward the outside of the array.

" Boom... " However, in the next moment, a water bucket thick bolt of lightning containing a touch of heavenly law descended from the void and struck Luo Li's body.

" Damn it! Uncle Wan's array even禁了 the void!" Luo Li's face showed bitterness. He looked at the void with no signs of opening and spoke softly.

" Kids, save your strength. We've thought of all the escape methods you could think of. Just stay in this array and cultivate. Wait for us to come out! " A loud laugh echoed above their heads, the voice authoritative.

" Alas... " Luo Li and Gu Guanyu's eyes showed disappointment. They had hoped to fight alongside Luo Tian, but instead, Luo Tian had trapped them.

The young ones obediently cultivated. Luo Tian's group didn't interfere, as the array protected them. They probably wouldn't have problems in this region.

Luo Tian and his group continued deeper, their eyes increasingly solemn. Even with their cultivation levels, they felt immense pressure in the thunder sea.

" How long will this go on! " Diao Dedu's eyes showed a touch of trembling. He looked at the endless thunder sea, his body battered by lightning and complaining.

" Your nose is good. Smell around here. Is there any scent of Qian Xue's people! " Luo Tian addressed Diao Dedu. He didn't want to go deeper, as this was a deadly place. They were now alone, the entire world filled with terrifying thunder.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Diao Dedu sniffed. Thunder power rushed into his nose.

" Achoo... " Diao Dedu sneezed loudly. His eyes showed disappointment, shaking his head.

" All thunder power! It covers all scents. I can't smell anything! " Diao Dedu addressed Luo Tian and the others.

Although prepared, Luo Tian was still disappointed. He looked solemnly into the depths of the thunder sea.

" Then we'll have to take a risk! " Luo Tian's eyes showed determination. He looked at the three others: " Let's go!"

Soon, Luo Tian and his group entered deeper into the thunder sea. They stopped talking and focused on resisting the terrifying lightning.

They continued moving, and the power of thunder grew stronger. However, it was still within their capacity.

" What is that? " After moving several million li, they finally saw a ghostly figure approaching them.

" Is it a living being? " Luo Tian and his group looked at the figure, their eyes filled with confusion.

The figure's aura wasn't strong, but in this thunder sea it had no obstacles. It seemed to be favored by fate.

In a blink, the figure appeared before Luo Tian's group. They saw the figure clearly.

" Human-shaped lightning! " Diao Dedu exclaimed, surprised to see human-shaped lightning in this place.

" Something's wrong. This human-shaped lightning seems strong, but it's still weaker than the ones in the heavenly punishment! " Diao Dedu punched the human-shaped lightning and shattered it, his eyes filled with confusion.

" Hum... " A series of humming sounds echoed in Luo Tian's hands. In the next moment, a gray aura flew out from where Diao Dedu had shattered the human-shaped lightning and was captured by Luo Tian.

" This is a soul? " Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed. He crushed the soul with his hand, a hint of confusion on his face.

The soul was very weak, almost negligible. If not for Luo Tian's exceptional perception of souls, even Diao Dedu and others wouldn't have noticed it.

" This residual soul - was it a soul of someone who had come to this thunder sea before, or did the thunder sea itself cultivate it! " Luo Tian's mind was filled with confusion.

If it were the former, it would be understandable. But if it were the latter, that would be terrifying. He quickly suppressed this thought.

" What's wrong? " Seeing Luo Tian's solemn expression, Diao Dedu and others asked.

" Roar... " Just as Diao Dedu's words ended, a series of roars echoed in Luo Tian's group's ears. Their eyes instantly became solemn.

" Boom... " Thunder roared, and a series of lightning bolts fell from the sky. They howled toward Luo Tian's group.

In their view, a series of figures radiated thunder power. They immediately surrounded Luo Tian's group from all sides.

" Damn it! Why so many! " Sun Kemin's eyes showed solemnity. He felt their human-shaped lightning's strength.

Endless, they couldn't count them. Although their strength was much weaker than theirs, the numbers were terrifying.

" All are beyond ordinary level. Some are at Saint level! " Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, estimating the strength of the human-shaped lightning. He spoke gently.

" What to do? Attack and kill them, or escape by speed! " Diao Dedu spoke softly, his body glowing with purple light.

But before Luo Tian could speak, the human-shaped lightning seemed to be guided by something. They transformed into bolts of lightning and attacked Luo Tian's group without fear.

" Push them back! " Luo Tian's face showed coldness. He flew forward, his hands moving to unleash the Nine Heavens Diagram of the God King, killing many human-shaped lightning in this move.

" Go! " Diao Dedu, Sun Kemin, and Wan Lingkong followed Luo Tian closely. Their hands glowed with brilliance, releasing powerful martial arts that continuously killed these human-shaped lightning without intelligence.

Although the number of human-shaped lightning was large, Luo Tian's group had no fear. They only slowed their steps slightly.

" Ten thousand... one hundred thousand... one million... " As Luo Tian flew, he didn't know how many he had killed. But these human-shaped lightning seemed endless, stretching beyond sight. This made the four feel increasingly anxious.

" How many more are there! " Luo Tian thought as he flew, a bad feeling rising in his heart.

The four had killed for an hour but still hadn't escaped the human-shaped lightning's encirclement. Even they felt their hands were getting tired.

" Luo Tian, this is a formation! " As the three continued to kill, Wan Lingkong's voice echoed in their minds. This made them startled.

" What do you mean, this is a formation? Why didn't we notice it! " Sun Kemin asked. Few things could make them not notice a formation.

" No wonder it's one of the nine deadly places! " Luo Tian showed admiration, looking at Wan Lingkong and waiting for his explanation.

" Unless you kill all these human-shaped lightning at once, there's no end! " Wan Lingkong sighed.

" Don't talk nonsense. If we continue like this, we'll be exhausted eventually! " Sun Kemin finally couldn't bear the exhaustion and unleashed his Yang Fish.

Chapter 1414: Old Friends

" Hum... " The white Yang Fish jumped above their heads, spreading Epoch light. It annihilated the human-shaped lightning with a white glow, scattering into thunder that spread outward.

But even though the Yang Fish was powerful, there were too many human-shaped lightning. They killed one batch after another. Unless they annihilated them all at once.

" Who can kill so many human-shaped lightning with one move? Unless it's the Epoch Master or a仙! " Sun Kemin shook his head, disappointment in his eyes.

" We're already inside the thunder sea. We've been trapped here! " Diao Dedu showed strong fear, looking at the deeper thunder sea.

" Wan Lingkong, don't be so mysterious. Tell us what the other way is! " They focused their eyes on Wan Lingkong.

" Find the array's core and kill the strongest human-shaped lightning. That should do it! " Wan Lingkong spoke softly, a touch of excitement in his eyes. This was his different confrontation with the Epoch Master.
