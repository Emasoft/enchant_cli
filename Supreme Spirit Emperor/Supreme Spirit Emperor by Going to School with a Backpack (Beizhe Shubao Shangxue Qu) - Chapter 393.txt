“His true face was concealed by a secret technique. I ran all the way here, intending to hide in the Demon Realm's Holy City. Moreover, I also planned to visit the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Ren Hongzhe softly shook his head.

“Going to the Four Sacred Star Domains?” Luotian's face immediately showed confusion. After all, if Ren Hongzhe remained in the Demon Mountain, with Nan Gong Yuqing and Li Tianzhi present, how could he have been ambushed?

“Senior Brother was severely wounded. I came to borrow the Purple Apex Divine Lotus from you to heal him. On my way past the Ancient Spirit and Demon Cave, someone attacked me!” Ren Hongzhe spoke softly.

“What?” Upon hearing Ren Hongzhe's words, Luotian and the others' eyes slightly narrowed, filled with disbelief.

“Why did Nan Gong Yuqing get injured?” Diaodezhu asked in bewilderment. After all, Nan Gong Yuqing was now a domain master-level powerhouse and the leader of the Demon Clan. Even Luotian would have to pay a price to injure him.

“The offspring of the Epoch Lords from both the Divine and Demon Clans emerged. They were close friends, attempting to merge the two clans, but someone opposed it. After all, the Divine and Demon Clans have been at odds for a long time!” Ren Hongzhe spoke.

“Of course. The old leader of the Demon Clan's death was tied to the Divine Clan's shadow. Nan Gong Yuqing would naturally refuse!” Diaodezhu spoke softly.

“So, the two opposing sides set up a duel. The winner would have their way!”

“But the duel was still a month away when Senior Brother was severely wounded on his journey back to the Demon Clan!” Ren Hongzhe gritted his teeth.

“Who attacked him? Was it the Divine Clan?” Diaodezhu's face showed confusion. He could not fathom who would attack Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Not sure. Recently, it was rumored that the Divine Clan's clan leader, Sun Miechen, was also severely wounded.”

“And Sun Miechen opposed the merger of the two clans as well!” Ren Hongzhe sighed deeply.

“My purpose in going to the Four Sacred Star Domains is twofold: first, to borrow the Purple Apex Divine Lotus; second, I heard that you had returned, so I wanted to see if you could help!” Ren Hongzhe's gaze was heavy with concern.

“Truly chaotic,” Luotian and the others sighed in unison, then turned their gaze toward Ren Hongzhe.

“What is the current situation between the Divine and Demon Clans?” Luotian asked. He knew he would inevitably have to visit the Demon Clan, as Nan Gong Yuqing had been severely wounded. He must see it for himself.

“There hasn’t been any major incident yet. After all, Second Brother is still around. Although we are not of the Demon Clan, Second Brother possesses an Epoch Treasure. No one dares to touch us!” Ren Hongzhe replied, then surveyed Luotian and the others before spotting Yao Chen shouldering a black staff.

“Was it you who sneaked up on me?” Ren Hongzhe immediately realized the one who had nearly knocked him out with a single strike.

“What do you mean ‘sneak attack’? Your own skills are lacking; why would you need to sneak?” Yao Chen sneered, eyes filled with contempt.

“You…” Upon hearing Yao Chen's words, Ren Hongzhe immediately became furious. Who was he? The third of the Star River Four Thieves, once a man who had survived on the edge of his blade. He had just been ambushed and struck with a blunt weapon, how could he endure it?

“Big mouth, I support you. Take him down!” Diaodezhu saw Ren Hongzhe's anger and began encouraging him.

“Right! Big mouth, I support you too!” Yan Jun naturally wouldn’t miss out, always wanting others to experience the same pain.

“Good! I’ll see what talent you have that dares to strike Senior Brother’s blunt weapon!” Ren Hongzhe's aura surged. After recovering from Luotian’s elixir, his injuries were nearly healed. He dashed toward Yao Chen.

“Ha! I was itching for a fight. Let’s start with conquering the Divine and Demon Realms!” Yao Chen, naturally not refusing a fight, swung his dark staff and swept it forward.

“Truly…” Luotian watched the two instantly clashing, feeling a headache. He and Sun Mengru stepped back to give them space.

“Boom…!” The thunderous sound echoed continuously. Ren Hongzhe and Yao Chen fought under the starry sky.

“I bet one hundred million Qi Stones that Big Mouth can’t last a quarter of an hour!” Diaodezhu smiled, watching the two locked in battle.

“You underestimate Big Mouth too much. I bet one hundred million Qi Stones, he won’t last half a quarter!” Yan Jun folded his arms, watching Ren Hongzhe immediately suppressed.

Hearing Yan Jun’s words, Luotian's lips twitched. He thought of the simple Yan Jun from before. After so many years with Xu Lizi and Diaodezhu, he had become sly.

“Plop…” After half a quarter of an hour, Ren Hongzhe’s head had two large bumps. He flew back to Luotian and the others.

“Kid, are you ready to surrender?” Yao Chen grinned, looking at Ren Hongzhe with a smug expression.

“Not yet!” Ren Hongzhe glared at Yao Chen’s smug face, his expression darkened further. He was awed by Yao Chen's strength but shouted defiantly.

“Not yet, let’s fight again. That was just a warm-up!” Yao Chen heard Ren Hongzhe's words and bared his teeth, looking like a monkey as he spoke to Ren Hongzhe.

“I can’t beat you!”

“But I won’t surrender. What are you going to do?” Ren Hongzhe shouted, standing behind Luotian, looking at Yao Chen with disdain.

“Hmph…” Yao Chen initially felt pleased but was soon annoyed by Ren Hongzhe’s words. He swung his staff, sweeping it toward Ren Hongzhe.

“Enough!” Luotian shouted, grabbing the dark staff with one hand. His face showed impatience.

“Buzz…” At the moment Luotian grabbed Yao Chen’s staff, a golden sword beam suddenly shot out from the void, aiming at Ren Hongzhe's back heart.

This blade appeared too quickly. It caught Luotian and Yao Chen colliding, and others were distracted by their collision.

“Be careful!” Luotian's arm went numb. He was closest to Ren Hongzhe, so he turned around instantly and grabbed the golden blade with his other hand.

“Plop…” The blade suddenly stopped. At the same time, blood gushed out from Luotian's palm.

“Who!” Luotian felt the familiarity of this blade. His face turned icy, crushing the blade with his hand and gazing into the void with a deep gaze. This blade was identical to the one that had ambushed him in the Four Sacred Star Domains, carrying the same aura.

Ren Hongzhe's cold sweat flowed. If it weren’t for Luotian’s quick reaction, he would have been severely wounded or even killed.

“Luotian, are you okay? No harm?” Diaodezhu and the others immediately gathered in front of Luotian, cautiously looking around.

“Fine!” His wound slowly healed. Luotian's eyes flashed with purple light, stepping into the stars and reaching out to appear in the void.

“Again!” Luotian's face darkened, still seeing a phantom figure vanish into the void currents.

“Yao Chen, if you attack your own people again, don’t blame me for being harsh!” Luotian warned Yao Chen as he stepped out of the void. Although Yao Chen had no ill intent, his aggressive nature was a headache.

“Buzz…” Two golden lights flashed, piercing through the void. Yao Chen's face was also cold, ignoring Luotian’s words.

“Daring to sneak attack me? I won’t let your sect go unpunished!” Yao Chen spoke coldly, then grabbed his staff and rushed into the void.

Chapter 1557: Mutual Caution

“What’s going on?”

“Can he find the attacker?” Luotian watched Yao Chen, who had vanished into the void with his entire body glowing golden and radiating power. His eyes showed confusion.

“Probably can. That monkey’s eyes are sharp!” Diaodezhu and Yan Jun replied, their voices carrying a hint of amusement.

“Although the monkey is aggressive, he’s also fiercely protective. If anyone harms his friends, he’ll fight them to the death!”

“If this person is caught by the monkey, they won’t have a good outcome!” Yan Jun spoke softly, his voice carrying amusement.

“Dog, sniff out where this monkey went. Don’t get hurt; this is the Divine and Demon Realm!” Ren Hongzhe addressed Diaodezhu. He knew the waters of the Divine and Demon Realm were deep.

“You dare call me a dog!” Upon hearing Ren Hongzhe’s words, Diaodezhu jumped up, ready to fight.

“Stop fooling around. What’s the time for this?” Luotian pulled Diaodezhu down, feeling a headache. Everyone was a troublemaker.

Diaodezhu sniffed the air. Although he couldn’t find the attacker, he could track Yao Chen’s aura.

“Found it! Should we chase after?” Diaodezhu asked Luotian. After all, Nan Gong Yuqing was still severely wounded and they needed to check the situation.

“Hongzhe, you and Zhan Biao go to the Four Sacred Star Domains and fetch the Purple Apex Divine Lotus. The four of us will watch this monkey!” Luotian made a quick decision.

“Good!” Ren Hongzhe nodded. Chen Zhanbiao was reluctant to part from Luotian, but he always obeyed Luotian’s orders. Their figures turned back and re-entered the Demon Realm.

“I’ll see who keeps targeting me!” Luotian’s face turned cold. He felt a vast net was targeting him, his companions, and the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Diaodezhu didn’t waste words. He moved his nose again, his body flashing into a purple light and flying toward the depths of the Divine and Demon Realm.

“Let’s go!” Luotian sneered, followed by Sun Mengru and Yan Jun.

Diaodezhu’s current cultivation had reached the Epoch Peak. His sense of smell was extraordinarily sharp. Within a moment, he found Yao Chen’s trail.

A massive continent floated under the slightly white stars. Golden divine patterns wrapped around it, and outside the continent, Yao Chen transformed into a thousand-zhang giant ape. He gripped his golden staff and swung it, radiating overwhelming power as he slammed it against the golden barrier.

“Boom…!” The thunderous sound spread across the starry sky. The entire continent trembled with Yao Chen’s strike.

“Here!” After the thunderous sound, Diaodezhu and Luotian's group instantly appeared beside Yao Chen. Their faces showed confusion.

“Monkey Brother!” Diaodezhu saw the golden-clad Yao Chen, his battle spirit blazing. He shouted.

“You took too long!” Yao Chen saw it was Luotian’s group and showed dissatisfaction. Then he addressed Luotian: “That person ran into this continent. If I’m not mistaken, this should be the Divine Clan’s continent!”

“Correct!” Luotian looked at the massive continent, his face darkened. He gazed at it with coldness.

“Monkey Brother, are you sure that person ran into the Divine Clan’s continent? The Divine Clan isn’t someone to be messed with!” Diaodezhu stopped being playful and became serious.

“Impossible to be wrong. I chased him all the way here. He just entered and then raised a barrier!” Yao Chen’s face was certain as he spoke to Luotian's group.

“Really the Divine Clan!” Hearing Yao Chen’s confirmation, Luotian whispered lowly. Although he had suspected it before, the fact that only the Ancient Kings and those Sacred Clans dared to attack him made sense.

“Looks like the Divine Clan has learned a lesson over these years. After that great battle, they destroyed their entire continent and now have barriers outside it!” Diaodezhu’s face showed a hint of amusement, watching the golden continent.

“Monkey, who are you to attack our Divine Clan!” Just as Yao Chen’s words finished, an angry voice echoed from the Divine Clan's continent. Several figures burst out of the barrier and appeared in Luotian’s group's view.

The leader was a black-clad and white-clad young man, followed by several elders. Upon seeing Luotian’s group, their faces slightly tensed.

“Luotian?” The two young men immediately scrutinized Luotian, their eyes filled with amusement.

“Luotian, what’s your intention? Why did you bring people to attack our Divine Clan's formation!” Before the two young men could speak, an elder behind them spoke sharply.

“Sun Zhanbo?” Luotian recognized the elder’s identity, a Divine Clan elder. Although he knew of him, they weren’t close acquaintances.

“Sun Zhanbo, what are you? Don’t act like you’re in charge here. Where are Sun Miechen and Sun Shengtian?” Before Luotian could speak, Diaodezhu’s voice rang out behind him.

“The Divine Clan's leader and his son are busy, so they couldn’t come. This is my Divine Clan’s Epoch Lord's offspring, Sun Hongyang, who currently manages the clan,” Sun Zhanbo said respectfully, gazing at the young man in golden robes.

“You’re the one who’s been talked about so much, Luotian?” Sun Hongyang looked at Luotian with a scrutinizing gaze before speaking softly, his whole body radiating arrogance.

“Hmph… it’s you who dared to sneak attack us?” Before Luotian could respond, Yao Chen transformed into a thousand-zhang giant ape and bared his teeth. He swung his golden staff without hesitation, slamming it toward Sun Hongyang.

“Buzz…” A golden divine sword suddenly rose from behind Sun Hongyang, its golden light cutting through the sky.

Sun Hongyang’s face was cold. He gestured with his hands, and the golden divine sword expanded above him, transforming into a sky-splitting sword. It clashed with Yao Chen’s staff.

“Crack…” The stars cracked, light flashed, and Yao Chen's massive body took two steps back, his face showing surprise.

Sun Hongyang’s body was also pushed down into the stars but returned to view instantly.

“This monkey, do you think we of the Divine Clan are easy targets? First, attacking our formation, then assaulting my clan’s Epoch Lord's offspring!” Sun Zhanbo looked at Sun Hongyang with trembling hands and shouted loudly.

“Previously, you sneaked attack us. Now you dare to say we欺负 you? The Divine Clan is really getting more shameless!” Diaodezhu’s face showed contempt, gazing at Sun Zhanbo. Although Yao Chen often bullied them, Diaodezhu still stood on Yao Chen’s side.

“Monkey Brother, flatten the Divine Clan's continent!” Yan Jun also stood there and shouted at Yao Chen, his eyes filled with excitement.

No need for Diaodezhu and Yan Jun to speak. The naturally hot-tempered Yao Chen had already swung his staff, rushing toward Sun Hongyang again.

“Luotian, are you really going to be enemies with our Divine Clan?”

“You said we sneaked attack you. What evidence do you have that my clan’s Epoch Lord's offspring sneaked attacked you? Do you want to start a war between our two star domains?” Sun Zhanbo shouted again, watching Luotian who had remained silent.

“Crack…” As Sun Zhanbo’s words finished, Sun Hongyang clashed with Yao Chen again. Their bodies took a step back and stared at each other, Sun Hongyang’s eyes flashing with coldness.

“Good kid, still arguing!” Although he had clashed with Sun Hongyang, Yao Chen clearly heard Sun Zhanbo’s words.

“Yao Chen, enough!” As Yao Chen was about to strike again, Luotian’s voice echoed in the starry sky. Yao Chen's body paused slightly.

“Why?” Yao Chen’s face showed confusion. Although he hadn’t known Luotian for long, he felt Luotian’s character was definitely not bad. After all, Luotian had many people around him, like Long Jie and Diaodezhu. He couldn’t understand why Luotian would tell him to stop, even after being ambushed and nearly ridden over.

“Listen to me once!” Luotian transmitted his thoughts to Yao Chen. Then he flew up, gazing at the Divine Clan’s people.

“Divine Clan's Epoch Lord's offspring, Sun Hongyang? Then this one must be the Demon Clan’s Epoch Lord's offspring?” Luotian smiled, then looked at another young man in black robes and spoke softly.

“Correct. I am Nan Gong Wubai!” The black-cloaked young man spoke coldly, gazing at Luotian and responding softly.

“Nan Gong Wubai. Your name is quite bold, but you’re still a wimp!” Yao Chen’s face showed contempt as he spoke. He clearly had an issue with Nan Gong Wubai's name.

“Speak up! Why did you sneak attack me?” Luotian smiled, returning his gaze to Sun Hongyang.

“When did I sneak attack you?” Sun Hongyang smiled and denied it, convinced that Luotian wouldn’t dare to do anything against them outside the Divine Clan's continent.

“However, you came here so aggressively. Shouldn’t you give us an explanation?” Before Luotian could speak, Sun Hongyang replied directly.

“Sun, are you your father’s real son? The Epoch Lord is so mighty, subduing the heavens and earth. How come you can’t even admit what you did?” Diaodezhu shouted, his voice filled with contempt.

“Looks like the Divine Clan and Demon Clan really are going to merge!” Luotian sighed inwardly, but his face showed a hint of amusement.

“Two of you. I don’t care how the Divine Clan and Demon Clan merge, but Nan Gong Yuqing is my friend. If he has any more problems, I will hold you responsible. Of course, you can ignore my words and continue as before!”

“But the consequences are yours to consider!”

Luotian spoke coldly, his aura gradually rising. Then he flashed forward and appeared in front of Sun Zhanbo.

Chapter 1558: Soul-Draining Nails

“You…” Sun Zhanbo looked at Luotian who had suddenly appeared in front of him. His face changed instantly, not expecting Luotian to appear so close.

“Crack…” Before Sun Zhanbo could speak further, a hand covered in white inscriptions grabbed his neck. The white inscriptions flowed into Sun Zhanbo’s body, which had gone dazed.

Sun Zhanbo was about to resist when a powerful sealing force rushed into his body, halting his cultivation.

“Buzz…” Luotian’s feet moved with wind, carrying Sun Zhanbo back toward Diaodezhu and the others.

“Damn!” Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai’s faces darkened. They raised glowing lights, a black and white dragon emerging from their hands to block Luotian’s escape route.

“Leave… if you really want to start a war, I’m ready!” Luotian’s cold voice echoed in the starry sky. At the same time, he grabbed Sun Zhanbo with one hand and punched two fists at the two dragons.

“Boom… Boom…” Two thunderous sounds echoed. The two powerful dragons were shattered by Luotian’s fists, and Luotian's body returned to his group.

“Smack…” Upon returning in front of the group, Luotian swung his hand and slapped Sun Zhanbo’s old face.

“Thinking you found a patron, so you dare to boss me around?” Luotian sneered. The sheer power of his unmatchable body was beyond Sun Zhanbo's ability to withstand.

After one slap, Sun Zhanbo’s head had multiple cracks. He felt his soul was pulled out by Luotian's slap.

“Not even Sun Miechen dared to talk to me like that. What are you?” Luotian smiled coldly, showing no regard for Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai’s fury.

“Luotian, you hit my people in front of me. You really don’t respect me!” Sun Hongyang spoke loudly, his body radiating divine light. A golden divine sword hovered above him.

“You’re nothing. The offspring of the Epoch Lord is so impressive, but I am too!” Yao Chen waved his golden staff and spoke contemptuously to Sun Hongyang.

“Smack…” Luotian’s second slap fell, and Sun Zhanbo's head turned into a blood mist. His body was thrown in front of Diaodezhu and the others.

“Are you really ready to fight?” Luotian showed contempt, scanning Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai.

Luotian was no longer the weakling others could bully. His strength, his faction, and his patron were all reasons for his arrogance. He feared no power.

“Think you’re the Epoch Lord?” Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai’s faces were cold, but they didn’t attack.

“Smack…” Diaodezhu and the others beat Sun Zhanbo, then returned him to the Divine Clan’s group with contempt.

“I have some connection with Xuan Yuqiong. By rank, you are his juniors. This time, let’s just forget it!”

“If there is another time, prepare for the three domains of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Demon Realm, and Fire Domain to flatten the Divine Clan!” Luotian looked deeply at Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai, then signaled to Diaodezhu and the others before flying toward the Demon Clan.

“Alas…” Yao Chen watched Luotian’s group leave, his face showing disappointment. He had hoped for a big fight but was surprised that Luotian ended it so easily.

“Want to fight? I’m always ready!” Yao Chen spoke to Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai before leaving.

“Damn…” Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai’s faces darkened. Although they hadn’t been defeated by Luotian, being hit in front of their own home and having their people beaten was a slap to their faces.

Who were they? The offspring of the Epoch Lord. Now, being cornered at their own doorstep and beaten in front of them—if it were known, they would have no prestige left among the Divine and Demon Clans.

“Little Lord, help me avenge!” Sun Zhanbo trembled with his face, addressing Sun Hongyang.

“Silence. Today’s incident must not be spread. If anyone spreads it, you know the consequences!” Sun Hongyang's face darkened as he scanned his group.

“This Luotian’s strength is truly strong. Even Sun Zhanbo, an Epoch Peak master, couldn’t resist him at all!” Nan Gong Wubai’s eyes showed concern as he spoke to Sun Hongyang.

“Indeed. If not for that, he wouldn’t have survived until now! His strength is strong but hasn’t reached the point where we need to look up to him. If we unite, we can definitely suppress him!” Sun Hongyang spoke softly, his face dark.

“Let’s first settle the matter of merging the two clans. There's nothing that can stop us now!”

“Yes, first merge the two clans and fully unify the Divine and Demon Realms. As for Luotian, anyone who blocks our path to enlightenment must die!” Sun Hongyang’s face was cold.

……

“Luotian, why are we leaving? Just beat those two bastards!” On the way to the Demon Clan, Yao Chen looked at Luotian with confusion.

“Monkey Brother, do you think the Divine Clan is so easy to bully? After all, they are a Sacred Clan. They once had an Epoch Lord, similar to our Demon Realm’s Holy City!” Diaodezhu explained to Yao Chen.

“Correct. We don’t have an Epoch Treasure, but if they really fight back and use the Divine Sword, with their two combined forces, we might not be able to withstand it!” Luotian nodded. If they could beat the Divine Clan, then the Divine Clan wouldn’t be a Sacred Clan.

“Also, I don’t know Nan Gong Yuqing’s condition. I need to check it!” Luotian didn’t know how severe Nan Gong Yuqing’s injuries were. Now that he had found who ambushed them, it would be easier to handle future matters.

“Okay…” Yao Chen shook his head, looking disappointed and dispirited as he followed Luotian’s group.

Time passed slowly. Half a day later, Luotian and the others arrived at the Demon Clan’s continent, blocked by an array barrier.

“Did the Demon Clan set up a barrier?” Diaodezhu showed confusion, then shouted toward the Demon Clan’s continent: “Nan Gong Yuqing! Grandfather Nan Gong, Lord of the Demon Clan, we’ve come to see you!”

Diaodezhu’s voice echoed through the barrier into the Demon Clan's continent. It immediately caused confusion among the Demon Clan, and several black figures flew out from the center of the continent.

“Luotian?” The first figure was an old man, the Lord of the Demon Clan. His face showed exhaustion, and behind him were several elders.

“Respectful greeting, Elder!” Luotian bowed to the Lord of the Demon Clan. His heart was puzzled; he wondered why only these elders had come out.

“Enough, you’ve reached the Epoch Peak. You no longer need to bow to me!” The Lord of the Demon Clan sighed, looking at Luotian.

“Elder, I heard that Nan Gong Yuqing was injured. I came to see if I could help!” Luotian’s respectful demeanor remained unchanged.

“Alas…” Upon hearing Luotian's words, the Lord of the Demon Clan sighed deeply and spoke: “Come on. Let’s go see him. You’ll know after seeing!”

Hearing the Lord of the Demon Clan's words, Luotian and the others felt a slight sinking in their hearts. They sensed the severity of the situation. But thinking back, if Nan Gong Yuqing's injuries weren’t serious, he wouldn’t have gone to the Four Sacred Star Domains for the immortal herb Purple Apex Divine Lotus.

They then entered the Demon Clan's continent and instantly appeared on the Demon Mountain.

“Why is the Demon Clan so quiet now?” Upon landing on the Demon Mountain, they felt a change in the Demon Clan compared to before. There were fewer people than before.

“This is something we’ll explain after you see Nan Gong Yuqing!” The Lord of the Demon Clan spoke softly, leading Luotian and the others toward the palace at the top of the mountain.

Upon entering the palace, an overwhelming aura descended upon Luotian and the others. Their faces slightly changed.

In the hall, Li Tianzhi sat cross-legged. Before him was Nan Gong Yuqing in black robes, lying there with pale face and closed eyes.

Above both of them hovered the Thunder Wheel, emitting a continuous humming sound. It radiated thunderous power and was driven by Li Tianzhi, continuously infusing it into Nan Gong Yuqing's body.

“Is this serious?” Luotian looked at the pale, unconscious Nan Gong Yuqing and his face slightly changed. He then approached Nan Gong Yuqing and Li Tianzhi, standing outside the Thunder Wheel's dragon shield. His vast spiritual awareness surged into Nan Gong Yuqing’s body.

“Impossible!” Upon Luotian's spiritual awareness entering Nan Gong Yuqing's body, his face changed abruptly and he spoke in disbelief.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing Luotian's expression, Diaodezhu and the others' faces also changed. They hadn’t seen Luotian like this in a long time.

“Nan Gong Yuqing was infected with Soul-Draining Nails!” Luotian spoke softly, his brows furrowed. This made Diaodezhu and the others more puzzled.

“What is a Soul-Draining Nail? Is it serious?” The Lord of the Demon Clan asked, his face showing concern.

“It is very serious!” Luotian sighed deeply. He hadn’t expected to encounter Soul-Draining Nails, but he was also secretly relieved that he had come to the Demon Clan. Otherwise, even with an immortal herb, it would be difficult to save Nan Gong Yuqing because only a Soul-Draining Master could perform the removal.

Chapter 1559: Doubts

“Soul-Draining Master!” Upon hearing Luotian's words, Diaodezhu and Sun Mengru’s faces also changed slightly. They knew Luotian was a Soul-Draining Master.

“How is that possible? It’s said there's only one left, you!” Diaodezhu showed confusion, looking at Luotian.

“Technically, there should be only one left. However, I discovered seven generations of Soul-Draining Masters’ souls surviving in a special way while I was in the Underworld!” Luotian spoke, his gaze deepening.

“Was it Qiu Jingming from the Underworld?” Luotian's brows furrowed. He clearly remembered he had completely destroyed Qiu Jingming in the Underworld.

“Or are there really other generations of Soul-Draining Masters who survived, helping Sun Hongyang and Nan Gong Wubai to attack?” Luotian kept thinking.

“Can Nan Gong Yuqing recover from his injuries?” However, it was Diaodezhu and the others’ words that made Luotian stop thinking. He looked at Nan Gong Yuqing.

“I have some confidence, but I can only try my best. After all, no one else in the world can remove these Soul-Draining Nails except for a Soul-Draining Master. Of course, maybe the Epoch Lord could remove them!” Luotian spoke softly and stepped into the Thunder Wheel's range.

Soul-Draining Nails were items formed by a Soul-Draining Master’s powerful spiritual force. They were inserted into others’ souls, continuously eroding their soul.

Luotian constantly recalled the teachings of the Soul-Draining Master left by the Epoch Lord about Soul-Draining Nails.

Although Soul-Draining Nails seemed simple, not everyone could remove them. If the method was wrong, it would not only fail to save the injured but also accelerate the erosion of the soul.

However, both the method and the required items were available to Luotian. Still, he wasn’t confident because the opponent was also a Soul-Draining Master; they might have left some hidden methods.

“Let’s try. It's better than suffering like this!” A low voice echoed from within the barrier. Nan Gong Yuqing, with a pale face, smiled and spoke to Luotian.

“Hmph!” Luotian knew the pain of being infected with Soul-Draining Nails. It was unbearable, even more terrifying than the curse he had endured.

Luotian stepped forward. Li Tianzhi didn’t stop him. Luotian's figure appeared before Nan Gong Yuqing, his face serious. He waved his hand and sent a pill into Nan Gong Yuqing’s mouth.

A humming sound echoed within Nan Gong Yuqing's body. At the same time, his face improved slightly.

“This is a Soul-Draining Pill. It can relieve some of your pain and give you a temporary numbness!” Luotian explained to Nan Gong Yuqing.

“But this pill can't be taken too much, otherwise it will harm your cultivation. And it won’t solve the problem!” Luotian shook his head gently, looking at Nan Gong Yuqing’s longing eyes.

“Why did I take this pill? Because removing the Soul-Draining Nails will be even more painful than now. Even if you are at the Epoch Peak, you won’t withstand this pain.”

“Yao Chen, lend me your staff for a moment!” Luotian addressed Yao Chen directly.

“Ah…” Yao Chen was reluctant but didn’t refuse Luotian’s face. He handed over the black staff made of unknown material to Luotian.

“Chew it…” Luotian told Nan Gong Yuqing, who chewed it.

“No need… I can endure…” Nan Gong Yuqing spoke palely but was immediately met with a pig-like scream.

“More painful by two or three times, and it won’t be short. You decide!” Luotian smiled at Nan Gong Yuqing and didn’t continue to bother him. He waved his hand, and a black mountain appeared in his palm—Zhaohun Stone.

His other hand was also busy. Another black mountain, but not Zhaohun Stone—Yuan Ci Mountain.

“Boom…!” Yuan Ci Mountain expanded with a thunderous sound, transforming into a mountain that stood before everyone. A strong suction force radiated from Yuan Ci Mountain.

Nan Gong Yuqing obediently chewed the staff, his face showing bitterness and deep hatred.

“It’s started!” Luotian spoke to Nan Gong Yuqing, then waved his hands continuously. Yuan Ci Mountain and Zhaohun Stone emitted waves, merging into Nan Gong Yuqing’s body.

Luotian's body also radiated gray mist. His vast spiritual force transformed into a gray hand, entering Nan Gong Yuqing’s body and grasping the gray Soul-Draining Nails within.

“Come out!” Luotian shouted loudly, staring at Nan Gong Yuqing. The Soul-Draining Nails moved slightly under Luotian’s pull and Yuan Ci Mountain's strong suction.

“Ugh…” Nan Gong Yuqing tightly chewed the black staff, his head veins bulging. Sweat poured from his forehead, and his eyes rolled white.

“Hold on!” Luotian focused. His gray hand pulled again, and the Soul-Draining Nails moved slightly.

“Creak…!” A terrible sound echoed in everyone's ears. It was Nan Gong Yuqing’s teeth biting the staff.
