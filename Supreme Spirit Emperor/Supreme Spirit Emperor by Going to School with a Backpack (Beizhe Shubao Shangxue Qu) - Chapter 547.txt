“Four Great Sovereign Beasts of Hell!” The people recognized the four statues, murmuring among themselves as they gazed upon their lifelike forms. These ferocious beasts held supreme status in Hell, and few dared to use these four ghostly creatures as sculptures.

“This hall contains thirty-six barriers. Whoever clears the barriers first shall be deemed worthy to enter our Reincarnation Hall!” Lin Dong spoke, raising his hand and sending a single drop of blood from his palm flying toward the grand hall’s entrance. The black door opened, revealing a dark passage that obscured the onlookers’ vision with swirling mist.

“Alright, those who wish to partake in the trial may enter. Use any method you choose—only the first to exit the hall shall succeed!” Lin Dong spoke again, omitting any further explanation. No rules meant that within the hall, all could fight without restraint.

“Buzz…” Almost as Lin Dong’s words faded into silence, dozens of figures surged toward the hall’s entrance. The first was Wang Lie, son of the Beast Ghost King! Wang Lie’s face brimmed with excitement as he transformed into a streak of light, vanishing from sight in an instant. Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou followed closely behind, matching Wang Lie’s pace as they plunged into the hall. The hum of energy echoed, and with each figure disappearing like stones dropped into water, they vanished without a ripple.

“Master, hurry!” Zhang Menlie saw Luo Tian moving with calm indifference and his eyes flashed with urgency.

“What’s there to be anxious about? Let them go; it’s no big deal!” Luo Tian smiled, confident in his protagonist’s aura. He was predestined, the chosen one of fate—how could these others surpass him? Luo Tian mused as he approached the hall’s entrance.

“Hmph, this Luo Chen seems to have given up entirely. He shows no urgency at all!”

“Did he truly abandon the trial? Or is his confidence so absolute that he lingers here?” The onlookers gazed at Luo Tian, their expressions filled with disbelief.

“Master is doing what?” The members of the Luo family wore puzzled looks. Though they knew the Reincarnation Hall had opened due to Luoshui’s desire for Luo Tian to enter, they were unaware that he was already predestined. Under the astonished gazes of others, Luo Tian slowly turned and waved to them. Seeing this, the crowd’s mouths twitched; they silently cursed the boy for his apparent lack of sense.

“Everyone, I didn’t murder a servant. It was the servant who sought to kill me, so I repelled him!” Luo Tian shouted, drawing further exasperation.

“Is that all? Who cares about your story? Just go in!” Lin Dong’s face darkened, barking with displeasure.

“Of course, of course!” Luo Tian nodded and stepped into the black door.

“Open!” As soon as Luo Tian entered, Lin Dong bellowed, and the hall’s door slammed shut instantly.

“Begin!” Li Dong addressed the thirty-six Reincarnation Hall disciples, his hands flashing through seals that landed upon the four black statues surrounding the hall. In an instant, the four dark statues were enveloped in black mist, coalescing into lifelike phantoms that roared in the sky. The thirty-six disciples released their divine immortal power, channeling it into the statues until they grew denser. The disciples themselves gradually became translucent and distorted, as if consumed by the four ghostly entities.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian took a step and appeared in a vast hall spanning miles. Around him were dozens of figures from the Beast King City. Yet, all remained wary, watching each other cautiously, fearing betrayal. Luo Tian’s arrival immediately drew attention, as everyone awaited the so-called barrier—but it never appeared.

“It’s Luo Chen, the last one. We’ve waited so long; he truly is a slowpoke!” The crowd’s faces bore annoyance, though their resentment was merely internal. After all, Luo Tian had a notorious reputation.

“Buzz…” As Wang Lie and Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou furrowed their brows at Luo Tian, a black barrier materialized before them. Then came the second… third… each one sending waves of unease through the crowd, even Luo Tian’s face showed a flicker of surprise. Thirty-six barriers, spaced about a hundred feet apart, spanning three thousand six hundred feet—this short distance felt like an insurmountable chasm.

“To break these barriers, one would need days to push through—only one at a time!” The crowd scattered immediately, eyes wary as they surveyed their surroundings. Dozens chose positions and stared at the barriers ahead, deep in thought about how to break through swiftly.

“Boom…” The next moment, a thunderous sound echoed as Chen Tianzhou punched forward, sending a black bone spike from his fist that surged toward the barrier.

“Screech…” A piercing sound rang out, fire flaring before Chen Tianzhou as an imprint appeared on the barrier.

“Again!” Chen Tianzhou roared, his second punch sending two black spikes piercing through the barrier. His fist collided with it.

“Crack…” A one-inch hole appeared on the barrier, its edges riddled with cracks. Chen Tianzhou laughed and swung again. Wang Lie merely frowned, raising a hand to send black seal characters toward the barrier.

“Open…” The black seals writhed, eventually forming cracks. Yan Shu’s pale face twisted into a grimace as he licked his crimson lips and spat out ghostly qi, which coalesced into a stinking puddle that began corroding the barrier.

“His speed is incredible!” Others wore expressions of astonishment, gazing at Wang Lie and the others, realizing they had no hope.

“We still have a chance. Perhaps one of these barriers will block them, allowing us to pass!” Yet they consoled themselves. Luo Tian furrowed his brow, unsure where the so-called cheating lay. He could only punch forward, driving it into the barrier with immense force. The token at his waist hummed violently, allowing him to pass through unimpeded—thus, Luo Tian was doomed.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed as Luo Tian collapsed onto the ground, his fist striking it with a resounding crack. This sound immediately drew attention, and everyone saw Luo Tian lying on the ground.

“Impossible!” Almost all gasped in unison, including Wang Lie and Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou.

“Damn it, this cheating is so careless!” Luo Tian brushed dust from his body and muttered under his breath. It was clearly obvious he had cheated.

“How did he get in so quickly?” Everyone was baffled, watching as the barrier sealed itself instantly after Luo Tian’s entry—preventing others from sneaking in behind him.

“There is only one possibility: he was truly chosen by the Reincarnation Hall!” Wang Lie, Yan Shu, and Chen Tianzhou immediately deduced.

“But this is too obvious. It’s so clear we can all see it!” They mused internally. Their families had known since the Reincarnation Hall’s announcement that someone would be specially favored, and they had guessed it was Luo Chen. Yet they still harbored resentment, believing they had a chance—until the Reincarnation Hall made it so obvious.

“Hey, you all keep smashing; I’ll go ahead!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed the crowd, patting his slightly swollen palm. He rose and strode toward the second barrier without hesitation, passing through it effortlessly.

“Unbelievable! How are we supposed to play this?!” One cried out as Luo Tian entered the second barrier. Even Wang Lie and his companions felt defeated; Luo Tian’s speed was too fast, leaving them no opportunity.

“I won’t accept it!” Wang Lie roared defiantly, his fist smashing through the barrier ahead. He entered the second level. Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou also unleashed their power, following him into the barrier.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian continued walking without haste, strolling calmly toward the third barrier. Fourth… fifth… Half an hour passed as Luo Tian reached the twentieth barrier, stretching and yawning. He hadn’t expected it to be so simple. A black altar stood before him, where thirty-six youths sat cross-legged—Zhang Tianhe wore a mocking smile.

“Let you enjoy yourself first; I’ll make you crawl out of here!” Zhang Tianhe mused, watching Luo Tian stroll leisurely.

“This is too boring,” one youth spoke, gazing at the curtain above where everyone struggled to break through the barriers.

“Let’s toy with that kid; it’s boring anyway!” The youth extended a hand, embedding a seal character beneath the altar.

Chapter 2093: The Trial Begins

A dark hall stood upon the ground, its four grotesque beasts leaving people awestruck.

“Four Great Sovereign Beasts of Hell!” The people recognized the four statues, murmuring among themselves as they gazed upon their lifelike forms. These ferocious beasts held supreme status in Hell, and few dared to use these four ghostly creatures as sculptures.

“This hall contains thirty-six barriers.

Chapter 2094: Obstacles

In the dark hall, a group of people continuously smashed through layer after layer of barriers, their eyes filled with resentment.

“Tenth level!” Wang Lie roared, his fist shattering the barrier before him and entering the eleventh level.

“Still no sign of Luo Chen. Damn it, how many levels has he reached?” Wang Lie furrowed his brow, gazing at the barriers ahead.

“According to his speed, he should have already succeeded. But since we haven’t been transported out, it’s clear he hasn’t broken through the thirty-sixth level. He must be blocked by something!”

“I still have a chance!” Wang Lie’s eyes glimmered with hope, launching himself toward the eleventh barrier. Chen Tianzhou and Yan Shu followed closely behind; they weren’t fools, and if Wang Lie could think of this, so could they. In an instant, everyone’s eyes reignited with hope as they desperately smashed through the barriers.

Luo Tian now strolled calmly toward the twenty-second barrier, a smile on his face as he approached it.

“Clang…” The next moment, a loud sound echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. He felt dizzy and fell onto the ground, his face bewildered.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian touched his forehead, which had a large bump. He gazed at the unchanging barrier.

“Haha, Huang Shixiong, you really know how to play!” The thirty-six youths seated on the altar burst into laughter, especially Zhang Tianhe, who felt a sense of relief and satisfaction.

“Where’s the cheating?” Luo Tian muttered under his breath, anger flashing in his eyes as he gazed at the barrier before him. He punched forward.

“Boom…” A powerful rebound force swept over Luo Tian’s body, sending him flying backward.

“So strong?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. Though he hadn’t personally encountered the barriers before, from Wang Lie’s and others’ situations, their shattered barriers were definitely not as strong as this one.

“Is it originally like this or…?” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened, recalling Zhang Tianhe seen among the Reincarnation Hall members.

“It must be him!” Luo Tian’s eyes glimmered with a smile. He launched himself forward, three punches colliding with the barrier.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed. The barrier trembled slightly, and Luo Tian had prepared for this. He retreated a hundred feet before returning to normal. However, the terrifying rebound force still caused his qi and blood to churn.

“Such immense power!” The thirty-six Reincarnation Hall disciples wore expressions of surprise.

“Though he was exceptionally admitted into the Reincarnation Hall, it doesn’t mean he’s a mediocre person. Our Reincarnation Hall has many geniuses who were exceptionally admitted and later became renowned!” The youth called Huang Shixiong smiled. He had felt the震荡 most directly, as each of the thirty-six disciples controlled one barrier. The hall’s collective will could influence everything, but it was dispersed across each barrier. Thus, the barriers had been easy for Luo Tian to pass through earlier.

“However… he’s merely decent. That’s all!” Huang Shixiong’s face showed disdain.

“Buzz…” As Huang Shixiong’s words faded, a terrifying wave rose above Luo Tian. Black claws tore through the void, hovering over Luo Tian’s head and clawing toward the barrier before him.

“Screech…” A piercing sound rang out, sparks flying as four deep grooves appeared on the barrier. Huang Shixiong, seated on the altar, trembled slightly. He was connected to the barrier; damage to it affected him too, but only if the destruction was significant. Earlier, when others had created small holes to squeeze through, it hadn’t affected Zhang Tianhe and the others. But this time was different—Luo Tian’s attack had caused Huang Shixiong to react, though it was only a slight dizziness.

“Again!” At this moment, Luo Tian roared and another black claw flew from the void toward the barrier.

This attack was even more ferocious, causing Huang Shixiong to tremble violently.

“What kind of monster is this kid!” The thirty-six disciples immediately questioned, gazing at Luo Tian panting heavily.

“Nothing’s wrong. I was just careless!” Huang Shixiong waved his hand, eyes indifferent. He hadn’t expected a mere Luo Tian to affect him like this.

“Manifesting the Dao of Heaven and Earth!”

“Martial Arts: Seven Stomps, Intercepting the Heavens…” Luo Tian shouted, unleashing a torrent of martial arts toward the barrier. The thunderous sound was overwhelming as each technique exploded against the barrier, causing Huang Shixiong’s body to tremble and his face to flush red.

“What a formidable opponent!” The thirty-six disciples gazed at Luo Tian, who stood panting heavily.

“This is truly tenacious!” Luo Tian’s gaze fell on the barrier, which still showed no signs of breaking. His eyes darkened with ferocity.

“Erhei, come out!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a small dog appeared at his feet, resembling a black ball.

“Can you break this barrier?” Luo Tian asked the black dog with a smile.

“Woof!” Erhei barked twice, his tiny black eyes filled with disdain as he nodded.

“Go break the barrier; I need to pass through!” Luo Tian ordered, standing still.

“Haha, if you keep pounding for a month, maybe you’ll break it. I didn’t expect you to use a dog to break this barrier!” Huang Shixiong’s face showed disdain, gazing at the black dog as if it had no combat power. However, the next moment, his face turned pale, and he gazed at the curtain.

“Crack…” The black barrier seemed like water, allowing Erhei to pass through without resistance.

“What kind of monster is this dog? It can penetrate my barrier!” Huang Shixiong’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Others also showed shock. They knew the nature of these barriers better than anyone, yet they hadn’t expected this plump dog to be so weak against them.

“Woof…” The dog’s barks echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making his eyes flicker with light.

“Good, it saves me the trouble!” Luo Tian nodded, signaling Erhei. The dog’s eyes glowed with divine light as it opened its mouth, and the black barrier twisted, rapidly flowing into Erhei’s maw.

“This…!” Everyone was stunned, gazing at the barrier being devoured by Erhei.

“Damn it, stop!” Huang Shixiong raised his hand, and the twisted barrier formed seals, as if in a struggle with Erhei. Yet it still flowed into Erhei’s mouth.

Stunned, everyone was speechless. They hadn’t expected this seemingly harmless dog to possess such terrifying power.

“Good job, Erhei! Haha!” Luo Tian laughed, his eyes glowing with light.

“Beast, stop!” Huang Shixiong’s face turned as pale as paper, his spiritual energy rising.

“Huang Shixiong, give up! Quickly sever the connection; if you continue like this, it might even absorb your cultivation!” The others saw Huang Shixiong’s plight and wore concern.

“Fine!” Huang Shixiong showed reluctance but ultimately bit his lip, severing the connection with the barrier. The seals vanished, and the massive barrier was instantly devoured by Erhei. His belly bulged as he licked his lips, gazing at the twenty-third barrier. However, Luo Tian had already retrieved him.

“Such a barrier was devoured by him…” The thirty-six disciples felt they had played too big. They hadn’t seen such a barrier before.

This barrier had endured countless trials without issue, but now it was devoured by this dog. They were stunned and didn’t know how to explain.

Luo Tian hadn’t let Erhei devour all the barriers. He continued forward, but this time he had learned: he extended his hand to touch the barrier, and his palm passed through it.

“Indeed, these are all manipulated!” Luo Tian smiled and stepped into the second barrier. He resumed his slow, leisurely walk while others desperately tried to catch up.

“This distance is wrong. How far is it? It should be the distance of two barriers!” Wang Lie reached the spot where Luo Tian had been and gazed at a more spacious hall, his eyes filled with confusion.

“Battle energy—just over half an hour ago!” Wang Lie sniffed, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Time is shrinking!” Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou also appeared, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Twenty-five… twenty-six…

Luo Tian no longer faced any obstacles, walking steadily toward the thirty-sixth level. Once he broke through it, he would be first.

“Zhang Di, prepare yourself. The thing I promised you is about to come true. Be careful; this kid’s strength is formidable!” Huang Shixiong addressed Zhang Tianhe.
