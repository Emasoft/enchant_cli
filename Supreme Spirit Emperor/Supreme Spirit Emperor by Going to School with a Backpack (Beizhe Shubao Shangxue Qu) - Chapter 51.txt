“Boom... Boom...” The middle-aged man raised his arm, which glowed with red light, repeatedly intercepting Luo Tian's martial arts techniques, producing a series of thunderous sounds. When the martial arts technique collided with the middle-aged man's arm, it exploded violently, and the terrifying energy caused his robe to flutter wildly.

“Soul-Stealing Seal!” Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, ignoring whether his attack had harmed the middle-aged man. As soon as the middle-aged man intercepted his martial arts technique, the Soul-Stealing Seal flew from his hands.

“Hmph?” The middle-aged man was momentarily puzzled, then felt a thunderous impact in his mind. It seemed as if a hammer had struck his head, leaving him dazed and disoriented.

In that instant, Luo Tian leapt into the air. From his storage ring, the Pacifying Soul Vessel flew out, accompanied by rolling thunderous roars that pressed down upon the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man was momentarily stunned, but he immediately sensed the terrifying pressure from the Pacifying Soul Vessel above him. His eyes widened with alarm; if he were struck, even ten of himself would not be enough!

“Boom!” The heavy Pacifying Soul Vessel landed on the ground, and a storm of dust swept toward Baihu and another middle-aged man engaged in combat.

This terrifying fluctuation caused both to slow their attacks, their faces filled with shock as they gazed at the mysterious bronze vessel.

The middle-aged man fighting Baihu looked incredulous, unable to believe that his companion had suffered a setback at Luo Tian's hands.

Baihu’s condition was also not good; an expert in the middle stage of bone-fragmentation was beyond its current capacity to handle. It would have already lost if not for the strength of a beast.

Seeing Luo Tian gain the upper hand, though he did not understand why Luo Tian had suddenly unleashed such a powerful attack, it was enough for him to be astonished. He knew the gap between them was vast. His white tiger eyes gleamed with a hint of joy; he understood that with their combined strength, they could still defeat one in the middle stage of bone-fragmentation.

Luo Tian stood on the ground, panting heavily. He could feel the corpse of a person suppressed beneath the Pacifying Soul Vessel. His heart lightened, and he carefully retrieved the vessel, revealing the corpse of the middle-aged expert.

But as soon as he saw the corpse, Luo Tian's face turned pale with shock.

“Boy, do you think the middle stage of bone-fragmentation is so easy to kill? Especially us from the Tianshi Sect!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, causing his face to flush with waves of turmoil.

The middle-aged man emerged from the dust, his gaze filled with disdain.

“Boy, I didn’t expect you to have so many treasures—storage rings, that strange vessel, and various martial arts! If I hadn’t used a corpse to replace myself, you might have succeeded!” The middle-aged man’s eyes burned with fervor but his heart trembled.

If he had hesitated a moment longer, it would have been him crushed beneath that strange vessel.

Luo Tian realized his failure as he saw the middle-aged man unharmed. Even after unleashing his full strength and using the Pacifying Soul Vessel, he had not wounded the middle-aged man severely. Thus, the middle-aged man would not grant him another chance to use it.

Yet Luo Tian felt some relief; the middle-aged man’s face was slightly pale, indicating a connection between the corpse and himself. The destruction of the corpse had inflicted some backlash on him.

“Boy, you truly have no chance now!” The middle-aged man sighed in admiration of Luo Tian’s strength but decided to end it swiftly. His body flickered, and he attacked Luo Tian.

Luo Tian sensed the middle-aged man’s figure vanish from his spiritual awareness and immediately hurled a talisman toward his trajectory.

“Eight Directions Mortal Water Talisman!” The talisman Luo Tian had obtained from Tu Yu Zheng in the Locking Spirit Tower was a technique comparable to an intermediate-level martial art.

As soon as the talisman left his hand, Luo Tian detonated it with his spiritual awareness.

A river of water erupted from the talisman’s explosion, blocking Luo Tian’s front and surging toward the middle-aged man’s trajectory.

The middle-aged man had not expected Luo Tian to have a talisman. Sensing the immense impact of the mortal water, he did not underestimate it. His spiritual energy surged, and he roared, “Shura’s Corpse-Striking Palm!”

A crimson palm formed before the middle-aged man, growing larger as spiritual energy passed through his hands. It expanded further and struck toward the approaching water waves.

“Crash…” The intermediate-level martial art was split in two by the middle-aged man’s palm, creating a passage before Luo Tian.

The middle-aged man sneered and flickered toward Luo Tian again.

As soon as the middle-aged man unleashed his technique, Luo Tian knew his talisman could not stop him. He retreated again, sighing inwardly: “The middle-stage of bone-fragmentation using martial arts is indeed far stronger than the魂祭 in the Locking Spirit Tower!”

At the same time, Luo Tian had another few talismans in his hands—obtained from other prodigies within the Locking Spirit Tower. Though not as powerful as the Eight Directions Mortal Water Talisman, they could at least delay the middle-aged man for a moment.

“Earthfire Talisman!… Thunderbolt Talisman!”

One after another, the talismans flew from Luo Tian’s hands, astonishing the middle-aged man. Though they could not harm him, they were enough to delay him for a moment.

Numerous colored martial arts techniques continuously surged toward the middle-aged man chasing Luo Tian. The middle-aged man, an expert in the middle stage of bone-fragmentation, ignored some and deflected others with a flick of his red-glowing arm.

As Luo Tian fled, he gradually approached the battlefield between Baihu and the other middle-aged man. He now understood it was not the time to fight directly; escaping was the only solution.

Chapter 247: Escape from Heaven ()

Chapter 247: Escape from Heaven

Luo Tian’s body continued to retreat, finally reaching the battlefield between Baihu and another middle-aged man.

At this moment, Baihu’s condition had deteriorated to its limit; with the other middle-aged man’s relentless attacks, it was constantly retreating, its white fur stained red with blood.

Luo Tian leapt toward Baihu’s front and without hesitation, he placed Baihu into his Nailing Spirit Bag.

“Boy! You really have so many treasures!” The middle-aged man, engaged in combat with Baihu, panted heavily, his eyes burning with desire as he gazed at Luo Tian.

After all, Baihu was an expert in the early stage of bone-fragmentation; even he, a middle-stage Tianshi Sect master, found it difficult to handle. Seeing Luo Tian retrieve Baihu, the middle-aged man struck toward Luo Tian with a fist.

At this moment, another middle-aged man’s attack also reached Luo Tian.

Feeling the two terrifying attacks, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty. Three drops of blood floated before him, and without hesitation, he absorbed them into his body.

A wave of unprecedented power filled Luo Tian’s body, making him feel exhilarated. He roared, and his entire body was filled with a crimson hue.

At this moment, the two attacks reached Luo Tian’s front, and their overwhelming spiritual energy struck his red body.

Luo Tian’s clothes exploded within a single breath, revealing a pale blue armor that radiated an ominous aura.

“Intermediate-level treasure armor?” The two men were stunned again by the treasures on Luo Tian’s body. From the very beginning of their battle, every item Luo Tian had used was no ordinary thing. If it were a regular middle-stage expert or if they weren’t two people, today they truly wouldn’t have had a way to deal with Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was struck by the combined attack of both men, his body flying backward repeatedly. Blood spewed from his mouth like water, though most of the attack was blocked by the Azure Leopard Soul-Water Armor. However, the immense impact from their combined strength still shook his spirit and mind.

Before he landed, Luo Tian suppressed the震荡 in his spirit and activated the Sealing Step, vanishing from the spot. He rushed toward the distance.

“Damn it!” The two middle-aged men roared in unison, appearing at the spot where Luo Tian had vanished. They looked toward the distance with a hint of frustration, then sensed for a moment before chasing after Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s condition was poor; although three drops of blood sustained him, the Sealing Step was a level-tertiary martial art. Under normal conditions, his spiritual energy could only support it for seven or eight times.

Indeed, Luo Tian had fused three drops of blood not to fight the two middle-aged men but to extend the number of times he could use the Sealing Step.

Luo Tian knew that only by taking advantage of their carelessness could he have a chance at survival. When he was struck back, he realized the opportunity had arrived. Suppressing his spiritual震荡, he activated the Sealing Step and appeared a hundred zhang away—its maximum range.

As soon as he landed, Luo Tian coughed up blood. His speed was so fast that it further injured him. Without hesitation, he activated the Sealing Step again upon appearing.

A mere hundred zhang was a moment’s work for an expert in the bone-fragmentation stage.

Indeed, shortly after Luo Tian vanished again, the two Tianshi Sect bone-fragmentation experts appeared at the spot. Their faces were fierce.

“Cunning little bastard!”
“Surely he used a secret method; I wonder how many times he can do it!” Their voices echoed in the spot, and their bodies rushed after Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness remained alert, sensing the two men chasing him like a stubborn plaster. His face turned pale with illness; he infused another three drops of blood into his body.

“One… two…” The three men chased each other, and with every pause Luo Tian made, his face grew paler.

“Buzz…” The fluctuation of spiritual energy was felt again; Luo Tian’s face was as pale as paper.

“I can’t continue like this! If I do, I’ll be dragged to death! Now, only by mastering the second step of the Sealing Step can I have a chance at survival!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness.

The three drops of blood were infused into his body again—this was the last three he could offer. Previously, he had extorted three drops of blood from each person in the Locking Spirit Tower and given some to Feng Tianxiong and Leng Qiuchan, leaving him with only nine drops.

Without hesitation, the blood merged into his body. Feeling his immense power, Luo Tian closed his eyes and took a slight step forward, attempting to take the second step of the Sealing Step.

A powerful tearing force pulled Luo Tian three hundred zhang away, and he felt his skin as if scraped by countless knives. Numerous wounds of various sizes appeared on his body.

“Cough… cough…” As soon as Luo Tian’s figure appeared, he coughed up two more mouthfuls of blood. He had no time to care where he was.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly; this second step was definitely beyond his current ability to perform. He doubted he could withstand the terrifying tearing force after a few more uses, and he couldn’t control his direction.

But now was not the time to consider these matters. Knowing he had no blood left, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with determination. He slammed his palm onto his chest, and a drop of blood flowed from his heart, instantly filling his entire body.

“Sealing Step—Second Step!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty, knowing that using the first step would make him easy to catch. His body vanished again from the spot.

“Three hundred zhang!” Soon after Luo Tian disappeared, the two middle-aged men appeared at the spot. Seeing the blood on the ground, their faces darkened.

“How did this kid run so fast?”
“This secret method must not last long!” They roared, their hearts filled with intense frustration as they chased after Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was now fighting for his life, and with every pause, he infused a drop of blood into his body without hesitation. He used the second step of the Sealing Step, regardless of whether his body could withstand it.

The result was good; with Luo Tian’s reckless escape, the distance between him and the two men kept increasing.

“Three hundred zhang… six hundred zhang… eight hundred zhang…” After more than ten uses of the Sealing Step, Luo Tian finally managed to escape from them.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian’s figure reappeared at the spot, his face devoid of color, looking like a bloodied person. He weakly stood on the ground without caring where he was. He quickly took out a pill from his storage ring and swallowed it.

After doing this, Luo Tian collapsed to the ground and fell unconscious, even forgetting to summon Baihu.

Chapter 248: Ning Yu’er ()

Chapter 248: Ning Yu’er

Outside the Tianyuan City, in a remote town not far from it, ordinary people could reach Tianyuan City within two hours.

Ning Yu’er was returning from selling vegetables in Tianyuan City, her face carrying a fresh smile. She had sold all the vegetables within two hours and was thinking about buying medicine for her mother again. Her steps were lightened by this.

However, when she reached the town’s entrance, she suddenly loosened her grip on the cart and covered her mouth with her hands, ignoring the dirt still on them.

Because she saw a bloodied person lying on the ground at the town’s entrance, his blood staining the surrounding ground. It was very frightening.

Ning Yu’er suppressed her fear and carefully approached the bloodied person, her face filled with terror. She picked up a branch nearby and gently prodded the seemingly terrifying bloodied person.

The stick pierced the bloodied person’s body, but he remained motionless, as if dead.

What surprised Ning Yu’er was that a faint green glow surrounded the bloodied person, as if repairing his body.

Seeing no reaction from the bloodied person, Ning Yu’er’s courage grew. She discarded the branch and carefully approached the bloodied person, touching what looked like a nose on him.

“He’s still alive!” Ning Yu’er’s face showed surprise; she hadn’t expected a person in such condition to still be alive.

“Save or not save?” Ning Yu’er was conflicted. Saving him would mean she couldn’t afford medicine for her mother, and it wasn’t certain he’d survive. Not saving him would be the same as killing him in her eyes.

Driven by her inherent kindness, Ning Yu’er’s face showed determination. She pushed the vegetable cart over and moved the bloodied person onto it, then wheeled him into the town.

“Yu’er, you’re back from selling vegetables?”
“Yu’er, what’s on the cart? Is this a person?” The neighbors kept asking Ning Yu’er about who was on her cart.

Ning Yu’er didn’t answer, sweat trickling from her forehead. She didn’t know why she felt the person on the cart was strangely heavy despite his thin appearance.

Quickly pushing the bloodied person into her home, she greeted her mother. A woman-like figure emerged from the inner room, looking weak.

Seeing her daughter bringing a red-hued object into the room, the woman looked puzzled and stepped forward. She coincidentally met her daughter coming out of the room.

“Xiaoyu, what did you bring back again?” The woman smiled with a hint of bitterness. She knew her daughter well; whenever she found injured cats or dogs, she would bring them home to heal. She thought her daughter had brought back something again to treat.

“Ah, Mother, don’t ask! Hurry and find Master Wang; I found an injured person. He’s very serious!” Ning Yu’er explained to her mother and hurriedly ran to the well, drawing a bucket of water. She turned around and walked into the room.

Hearing her daughter had saved a person, Ning’s mother was surprised and then went out to find Master Wang.

Ning Yu’er approached the bloodied person, took a towel and began wiping his face. Seeing the terrifying wounds on his face, Ning Yu’er’s face turned pale; she had never seen a person with such dense wounds. It wasn’t that the wounds were on his face, but rather his face was on the wounds.

However, when she wiped the bloodied person’s entire face clean, a familiar feeling stirred in Ning Yu’er’s heart. But the wounds were too numerous to let her see his true face.

After wiping the upper body of the bloodied person, Ning Yu’er could not proceed further. She was still a maiden and had already reached her limit by wiping his upper body. Continuing would mean removing the bloodied person’s pants, which she couldn’t do.

Fortunately, at this moment, Ning’s mother had already led a man resembling a doctor into the house.

Ning Yu’er sighed in relief, saying: “Master Wang, please take a look. Is he still salvageable?”

“Ugh…” The man called Master Wang by Ning Yu’er looked at the person on the bed with wounds all over his body and shuddered.

“Both of you go out, fetch another bucket of water, and leave the rest to me. Prepare the medical fee!” His face was slightly impatient as he sent Ning Yu’er and her mother out.

“Clang…” Ning Yu’er looked worried, standing outside the door of the room.

“Yu’er, who is he? Why is he so severely injured?” Ning’s mother asked with confusion, looking at Ning Yu’er. This bloodied person clearly wasn’t ordinary; she was afraid it might bring unnecessary trouble.

“I don’t know who he is, but I found him at the town’s entrance. Don’t worry, Mother; it shouldn’t be a big deal. When I wiped his body earlier, I felt a strange familiarity, but he was too injured for me to recognize who he was!” Ning Yu’er said with confusion.

“You silly girl! It’s your kindness that gets you into trouble!” Ning’s mother looked at her daughter with affection.

“Mother, don’t you remember the help from others? Without benefactors, I might not be in this situation!” Ning Yu’er said with a sigh.

“Stupid girl, we and benefactors are from different worlds. Don’t think about it!” Ning’s mother became impatient upon hearing her daughter constantly mention benefactors, clearly not the first time she had heard this.

“Ah, even if I were to be a servant for the benefactor, I would be content. I don’t know if he still remembers me!” Ning Yu’er didn’t heed her mother’s words and started talking to herself.

“Hmph, take care of him, I’ll rest a bit. I’m old and got tired after walking for a while!” Ning’s mother said goodbye to Ning Yu’er, her face pale and walked towards her room.

“Mother, I’ll send you!” Ning Yu’er interrupted herself and looked concerned, helping her mother back to the room.

Ning Yu’er arranged her mother and then went out, waiting at the door of her house.

Chapter 249: Alive ()

Chapter 249: Alive

An hour passed in Ning Yu’er’s long wait.

“Creak…” The doctor-like man emerged from Ning Yu’er’s room under her expectant gaze.

“How is he, Master Wang?” Ning Yu’er looked concerned, hoping the bloodied person she had saved would continue to live.

“It’s a bit difficult; I can only bandage his external wounds. He was injured too severely. However, I felt this person was unusual; if it were a regular person who lost so much blood, they would have already died. This person might be a cultivator, which is why he hasn’t died.” Master Wang said with a sigh.

He was just a local doctor, having treated no major illnesses but was somewhat famous in the town. He had never seen a person injured so severely before.

Hearing Master Wang’s words, Ning Yu’er felt disappointed; she thought if even the doctor couldn’t heal him, there was no hope. She had heard of cultivators before; the person who had saved her and her mother was a cultivator. However, Ning Yu’er didn’t believe this bloodied person was a cultivator because in her eyes, cultivators couldn’t be injured so severely.

She handed all the money she had earned from selling vegetables to Master Wang and sent him out of the house. Then, she entered her room and saw the bloodied person wrapped in bandages, with only two nostrils visible. She whispered: “I hope you don’t die; I’ve done my best!”

She emptied the two buckets of bloodwater under the bed and went to the courtyard to do farm work, returning home only at night to sleep with her mother in one room.

The next morning, she loaded the vegetables she had cleaned into the cart and went to sell them in Tianyuan City. When she returned home, it was almost noon.

Ning Yu’er looked at the bloodied person wrapped tightly in bandages on her bed, a look of disappointment on her face. She then continued with her tasks.

Luo Tian felt extremely uncomfortable; he had regained consciousness the previous night and could use his spiritual awareness, so he knew he had been saved by a young girl. He vaguely felt that he had met this girl before, but due to his severe injuries, he hadn’t thought further about where he had met her.

Luo Tian could feel how severe his injuries were and how many wounds he had. Some parts of his flesh were completely gone, exposing white bones—though Ning Yu’er hadn’t seen it.

Luo Tian had no choice but to rely on his thin wood-element spiritual energy for self-repair. Of course, if he could have done it himself, he would have opened his storage ring and taken pills to repair.

However, at this moment, Luo Tian clearly couldn’t do that; even moving a single finger was difficult. He cursed the doctor who had wrapped him in bandages, leaving only one nostril for breathing—extremely uncomfortable.

While cursing the doctor, he also secretly thanked his abnormal physique; he believed that if he had used the second step of the Sealing Step again, he would have truly died.

Weak wood-element spiritual energy continuously nourished his entire body. The pills he had taken before falling unconscious also constantly repaired his meridians and flesh, making Luo Tian’s body itchy as if a thousand ants were crawling over him. It was extremely uncomfortable.

What relieved Luo Tian was that his body was developing in the right direction. He believed he could move his arm within a day, and then he could open his storage ring to take out pills and recover faster.

“One hour… two hours…”

Time passed slowly, finally reaching the moment when Luo Tian’s arm could move. He used his spiritual awareness to drop a bottle of pills beside him, but he was frustrated because his arms were tightly bound and couldn’t move at all.

“Ah!” Ning Yu’er, as usual, came to check on Luo Tian and saw a bandaged arm struggling to move toward the side.

Following the direction of the arm, Ning Yu’er found the white jade bottle.

Ning Yu’er quickly approached the bed, took the bottle, and held it before Luo Tian, asking gently: “Do you need this?”

But Ning Yu’er was disappointed; at this moment, Luo Tian had only two nostrils visible and couldn’t understand what he meant.

Luo Tian also wanted to imprint his words into Ning Yu’er’s mind with spiritual awareness, but she was just an ordinary person. Luo Tian’s current condition was poor, and he didn’t dare to use it for fear of harming Ning Yu’er.

“Ah! I’ll help you take off the bandages on your head, okay? If you agree, move your hand; if not, don’t move!” Ning Yu’er asked cautiously.

Luo Tian sighed in admiration of Ning Yu’er’s intelligence and quickly moved his heavy arm to indicate he agreed.

“I’m going to take off the bandages on your head, okay?” Ning Yu’er greeted Luo Tian. Actually, she also wanted to see what he looked like.

Layer by layer of bandages were quickly removed by Ning Yu’er’s nimble hands, but when she saw the face covered in scars, her expression turned disappointed. However, it quickly returned to normal.

Luo Tian’s head was loosened, and he felt a sense of relief; being wrapped for two days made him feel extremely uncomfortable.

He struggled to open his heavy eyelids and saw Ning Yu’er’s clear face. He wanted to smile but couldn’t manage it.

A wave of sorrow filled his heart, and he looked at Ning Yu’er with a pleading gaze toward the jade bottle.

Ning Yu’er understood, knowing that this bottle might contain something useful for Luo Tian’s injuries. She took the bottle and poured out the pill.

As soon as the pill touched her hand, Ning Yu’er felt a wave of comfort; the fatigue from working early in the morning vanished instantly, and she felt more energetic.

She widened her eyes, looking at the black pill-like substance in her hand. She was certain that if she gave this pill to her mother, it would cure the long-standing illness of her mother.

Seeing Ning Yu’er’s amazement, Luo Tian felt no surprise at all. Not only would an ordinary person be amazed by such a pill, but even experts in the bone-fragmentation stage or spiritual essence stage would covet it. After all, the pill Luo Tian had taken was a rare six-star pill rarely seen in the Northern Region!

Chapter 250: Trouble Comes ()

Chapter 250: Trouble Comes

A thick wood-element spiritual energy spread throughout the courtyard. Ning’s mother also felt the change in their yard; she sensed her weak body had significantly improved. The pleasant sensation that made her feel comfortable came from the room where Ning Yu’er was.

Luo Tian felt bitter; he didn’t want to take out a six-star pill, but his current condition was unknown when it would recover. He also didn’t know how many days he had been here. If he delayed entering the Washing Spirit Pool, it would be a significant loss for him.

Luo Tian was gambling; he bet that Ning Yu’er wouldn’t keep the pill for herself. He could sense that Ning Yu’er was a simple and kind girl, so he had an 80% chance that she would give the pill to him.

Indeed, Ning Yu’er was slightly surprised but then opened Luo Tian’s mouth and placed the six-star pill, which even a bone-fragmentation peak or spiritual essence expert would covet, into his mouth.

Luo Tian sighed in admiration of Ning Yu’er’s kindness and felt a hint of joy. The pill he had taken was the six-star pill, “Sculpting Body Pill,” created by Lu Kunpeng.

As soon as the pill touched his mouth, Luo Tian felt a wave of comfort. This was his first time taking a six-star pill, and it was even one forged under the dual-element thunderstorm. He had only managed to forge three of them, giving one to Tian Bo and keeping one for himself. The remaining one was given to Luo Tian when he left the Five Elements Sect.

Luo Tian didn’t have time to think further; he closed his eyes, felt the power of the pill, and rested. The benefit of the Sculpting Body Pill was that it didn’t require any technique to refine; instead, the pill itself repaired the damaged meridians and bones. This was why Luo Tian had taken this pill.

At present, although Luo Tian could move his arm slightly, his meridians were damaged, and there were even cracks on his bones. Some parts had broken completely. In such a situation, taking the Sculpting Body Pill was ideal.

Seeing Luo Tian close his eyes, Ning Yu’er stepped out of the room and opened the door. She saw her mother walking out of the house.

Seeing her mother’s pale and weak body, Ning Yu’er felt some difficulty in忍耐. She helped her mother back to the room and told her about the miraculous effects of the pill.

Hearing Ning Yu’er’s words, her mother looked enlightened and naturally understood what her daughter was thinking. She comforted her gently: “Xiaoyu, you did the right thing. That pill is miraculous, but it’s not ours. Besides, it can save a person. My body knows itself; I can still endure for several years. It’s just that these years have been hard on you!”

“Mother, don’t worry; I’ll find someone to cure your illness!” Ning Yu’er said with determination, shouting at her mother.

“Xiaoyu, are you there? I’m coming in!” A kind voice came from the courtyard gate.

Hearing the sound, Ning Yu’er and her mother’s faces changed abruptly. They stood up and opened the door.

Outside the courtyard gate was a young man in a white silk robe, his black hair, but his face was pale. His eyes carried a hint of cruelty, though those not familiar wouldn’t notice the sinister glint in his eyes.

Ning Yu’er and her mother stepped out upon seeing the young man, knowing what he had come for.

“Shui大哥, can I delay paying the money by a few days? I’ll definitely give it to you in two days!” Ning Yu’er looked apologetic and spoke gently.

“Ah… Xiaoyu, why bring up the money? I didn’t come to collect it. I just want to invite you to take a trip in Tianyuan City!” Shui Xiujie smiled gently.

Though others didn’t know what Shui Xiujie was, the people in this town knew that this seemingly gentle young man had a sinister nature.

When Ning Yu’er and her mother moved to this town, Shui Xiujie had discovered them. At first, he acted like a kind older brother, helping Ning Yu’er with various tasks and spending a lot of money to repair their house and buy household items.

However, later Ning Yu’er and her mother realized that Shui Xiujie occasionally showed a greedy glint in his eyes. They noticed it but, due to Shui Xiujie being the son of the town’s chief and their unfamiliarity with this place, they had no choice but to tolerate it.

But over time, Shui Xiujie finally revealed his true nature and expressed his love for Ning Yu’er. However, she coldly refused him, which made Shui Xiujie furious and plan to use force. Fortunately, Ning Yu’er was clever and threatened to die, escaping from Shui Xiujie’s grasp.

But this also brought retaliation from Shui Xiujie. As the son of the town’s chief, he could get anything he wanted in this town. He frequently came to Ning Yu’er’s house, using the previous expenses for their home as an excuse to threaten her.

Ning Yu’er and her mother couldn’t resist too much, so they endured silently. Ning Yu’er’s money from selling vegetables was mostly taken by Shui Xiujie, forcing her to comply. They lived in misery under his control.

This situation had repeated countless times, and Ning Yu’er saw Shui Xiujie’s hypocritical appearance. She suppressed her nausea and said: “Sorry, Shui大哥, I have to do some work!”

“Xiaoyu, if you agree to my conditions, what else do you have to do?” Shui Xiujie smiled and spoke gently.

“Sorry, Shui大哥, I can’t accept your conditions!” Ning Yu’er remained determined.

“Xiaoyu, do you know that people’s patience is limited? I remind you, my patience ends today.” Shui Xiujie’s face showed impatience and waved his hand at the two men behind him.

“What are you going to do?” Ning’s mother asked with a weak voice.

“What am I going to do? I’ve wasted so much time on you. What else should I do? Let me tell you the truth, both of you must agree today; if not, you’ll have to agree anyway. Why are you still standing there? Take Ning Yu’er and bind her!” Shui Xiujie’s face showed greed as he ordered the two men behind him.

“Yes!” The two men obeyed Shui Xiujie’s command without hesitation, bowed and stepped toward Ning Yu’er.

Chapter 251: Awakening ()

Chapter 251: Awakening

Ning Yu’er’s face was grim, her heart filled with anger. She had come to this town because a rich young man from Tianyuan City had taken an interest in her, and she was rescued by someone who saved her. But now, a year later, the tragedy had repeated itself. Though she had been rescued before, there were no good people left in this town. This town was remote despite being near Tianyuan City.

Thinking of this, Ning Yu’er felt despair. Her mind involuntarily recalled the weak young man who had saved her, though he was thin; at that moment, she felt he was the strongest person in the world. And from his conversation with the Gu family of Tianyuan City, she knew this young man was named Luo Tian.

As Ning Yu’er was lost in thought, the two strong men had already approached her, their faces twisted with ferocity.

“Don’t move my daughter!” Ning’s mother stood in front of Ning Yu’er, shouting loudly. Her heart was also desperate.

“Move… old woman!” One of the men waved his hand and pushed Ning’s mother aside.
