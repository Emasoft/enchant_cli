"Damn it! If that old bastard hadn't been watching me fight, I don't know who would've come out first!" Zheng Xin cursed profusely.

"Where's Luo Tian?" However, soon people noticed someone was missing—Luo Tian hadn't emerged. Their faces immediately turned puzzled as they gazed at the slowly closing golden gate.

"He was participating in the outer disciples' trial, right? According to logic, he should have come out with us!" People grew anxious. After all, it was the renowned Star River Palace—perhaps something had happened to Luo Tian inside.

"It shouldn't be a problem. I just refined a token, though it was troublesome. There's no real danger. Even I could refine this token; how much more so for Luo Tian!" Diao Dezhu waved his hand, and a green token appeared in his grasp.

"Let's wait. Maybe he'll come out soon!" Jiang Sxi whispered, though worry gnawed at him. He knew that Long Jie and others might still enter the Star River Palace.

Jiang Sxi's words quieted the crowd. They stood outside the Star River Palace, waiting for Luo Tian's emergence.

"Thankfully those divine energies were withdrawn into the Star River Palace. Otherwise, if those stone warriors had attacked, we'd have faced a major problem!" Man Hun murmured, gazing at the Star River Ancient Path.

Time passed slowly. They waited an hour but still saw no sign of Luo Tian, growing increasingly anxious.

"Let's合力 break open the gate!" Long Jie could no longer sit still. His gaze locked onto the golden gate, his aura overwhelming.

"Buzz..." Just as Long Jie's words finished, waves of energy surged from the Star River Ancient Path. A crimson phantom flew toward them.

In a moment, the crimson phantom appeared before their eyes. They finally saw its form.

A crimson bat flapped its wings, appearing before them. Their faces showed confusion.

"Blood Seal?" Yan Hongtao's face bore confusion as he reached out. The crimson bat exploded into a blood-red talisman in his hand.

"Your methods of communication are truly unique!" Diao Dezhu and others looked on with interest, gazing at the incomprehensible characters on Yan Hongtao's talisman.

"Indeed, you're a killer by nature—so cautious!" The others snorted.

"Boom!" Yan Hongtao's talisman exploded, and at the same time, his expression changed abruptly.

"Something big has happened!" Yan Hongtao's gaze swept over the group, his voice laced with urgency.

"What else could go wrong? Did the Ancient Kings come?" Sun Kemin snorted. At this point, their strength was formidable; even if the Ancient Kings came, they had no fear.

"Indeed, the Ancient Kings have arrived. And they've already entered Nine Realms!" Yan Hongtao glanced at Sun Kemin in surprise.

"What... what?" Upon hearing Yan Hongtao's words, except for Du Hongxi and others, the faces of the rest changed abruptly.

"Sun Kemin, what are you saying? Your mouth really has no limits!" Zheng Xin and others cursed, then turned their gazes toward Jiang Sxi.

"Let's go. If Luo Tian emerges, he'll find us. The immediate priority is to deal with the Ancient Kings' invasion. Right now, the human realm is vulnerable; only the elder generation's masters are guarding it. The Ancient Kings have eight masters who've lived through two lifetimes—no time to waste!" Jiang Sxi pondered for a moment before leaping into the air, becoming a streak of light that soared along the Star River toward the Celestial Palace.

Others also rose, following Jiang Sxi's lead. Their eyes showed urgency; they knew Nine Realms were their foundation. If Nine Realms fell to the Ancient Kings, they would become homeless.

Without divine energy, those stone warriors that had previously blocked them no longer rose. The group quickly exited the Star River Ancient Path, appearing on the vast platform of the Celestial Palace.

"A thick scent of blood!" Upon landing, their faces changed drastically. They felt the intense bloodiness of Star Realm and the powerful battle fluctuations, as well as the deafening cries of war.

"Damn it! It's the Thunder Realm!" Their faces changed instantly, then they rose again, rushing out of the Celestial Palace toward the Thunder Realm.

Along the way, battles raged. They pushed through, heading toward the area with the strongest battle fluctuations. They didn't care about battles in other realms; they knew the Thunder Realm's fight was crucial.

Chapter 1737: Completion

The bloodied Nine Realms were ablaze with battles. The most watched event was the clash in the Thunder Realm, as the outcome of these people's victory or defeat would determine whether the human race would survive this life-or-death battle.

Gut Tianshu's aura reached heaven, his sword stained with blood. He pierced the heart of a second-life immortal from the Shadow Clan. Nine true dragons emerged from his other hand, evolving into a golden furnace that pressed upon the immortal's body.

"Boom..." Gray divine blood splattered. The Shadow Clan's immortal, pale-faced and weak, fell toward the stars. Gut Tianshu didn't chase him; other people's attacks had already descended upon his body.

A golden feather sword struck Gut Tianshu's body, leaving a blood trail on his back. Gut Tianshu coughed up some blood.

Before he could steady himself, a crimson long sword descended again. It pierced through the shattered stars above Gut Tianshu's head.

"Open!" Gut Tianshu roared. His golden sword swung, clashing with the crimson long sword.

"Gut Tianshu, are you despairing? How strong were you back then!" A master of the Crimson Phoenix Clan spat out divine fire, surrounding Gut Tianshu. The immense refining power could seemingly refine the entire starry sky.

"Cough... cough..." Gut Tianshu coughed twice, spitting out more blood. He looked at the approaching divine fire and his aura surged again. His body expanded dramatically.

"Go..." He took a golden step, stomping on the divine fire and extinguishing it. His gaze locked onto the four masters surrounding him.

"I've only lost once in my life—when I was defeated by Heaven itself!" Gut Tianshu stood straight, speaking loudly. He brandished his golden sword and charged at them again.

On another front, Dongbo Xin faced the same situation. He was also surrounded by four masters. At times he seemed like a legendary demon god, at other times like an awe-inspiring celestial deity. He constantly resisted their attacks while inflicting heavy wounds on them.

"Brilliant and unparalleled, but today it's destined to end in ruin. The Ancient Kings will reclaim this realm!" Several royal heirs continuously attacked, surrounding Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian. They observed Gut Tianshu's battle, feeling admiration for his invincibility despite being an enemy.

Compared to Gut Tianshu and Dongbo Xin, Diao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian were in a more desperate situation. They had nearly been killed several times, and now they were at their most pitiful state. If it weren't for Fu Xingyue and Fu Wenbin occasionally letting up, Diao Yuanshan would already be dead.

"What should we do?" Diao Yuanshan and others were at their wit's end, seeing the twenty or so figures with overwhelming auras. Despair rose in their hearts.

Zhong Zixuan and Xuantian Qiong were also resisting several strong enemies' attacks. Occasionally, they had to assist Diao Yuanshan and others.

"Where are those little brats? Why haven't they returned yet!" Diao Yuanshan and others felt bitter. If Luo Tian and the others were here, the situation would definitely not be this dire.

"Better to die than live in despair. At least we can kill two before dying, that would be worth it!" They made up their minds, eyes glaring fiercely at the group.

"Despairing?" The Ancient Kings' prodigies smiled, gazing at Diao Yuanshan. At this point, they were like meat on a chopping block.

"Too long for dreams; finish them off and kill those two masters together!" Someone spoke, sending waves of energy from their hands. A series of shocking martial arts spread among the group.

"Sorry, Luo Tian. We've done our best!" Fu Xingyue and others sent waves of energy, but although it seemed powerful, there was no actual killing power. This was all they could do now.

"Divine Heaven Shatters the Nine Heavens!"

"Diao's Path Spans the World!" Seeing the Ancient Kings' energy waves, Diao Yuanshan and others showed madness. They knew under those terrifying waves, with their current state, they couldn't withstand it. They decided to fight for their lives.

"Grandpa, don't rush into battle yet!" Just as they were about to fight desperately, a series of angry roars echoed. Then several streaks of light instantly appeared beneath the shattered stars.

"Buzz..." Divine light flashed, and the Demon Emperor's Mirror radiated a terrifying glow. It first flew in, enveloping Diao Dezhu and others with divine light.

The Divine Emperor's Sword and the Demon Emperor's Blade had also returned to Nangong Yuqing and Sun Feiwen. Following the Demon Emperor's Mirror, they flew above Diao Dezhu and others, enveloping them.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The thunderous sound was overwhelming. When those powerful epoch treasures arrived, the Ancient Kings' attacks all crashed against Diao Yuanshan and others.

The stars shattered. A series of powerful martial arts exploded before Diao Yuanshan, and the barriers formed by the epoch treasures shattered. The waves struck their bodies, instantly sending them flying backward.

"Cough... cough..." Diao Yuanshan and others spat blood, their flesh cracked, their bodies seeming ready to collapse at any moment.

"Grandpa!" Diao Dezhu moved swiftly, catching Diao Yuanshan. His gaze locked onto the Ancient Kings' figures with overwhelming auras.

"Damn it, they really know how to choose their timing!" Wang Wang and Jun Wulei also appeared beneath the stars, catching Sun Shengtian and others.

"Kill..." Without a word, they flew forward, rushing toward the Ancient Kings. This shocked all the Ancient Kings.

With nearly fifty people from various realms, including Du Hongxi and others, their numbers were double that of the Ancient Kings. The situation instantly turned around.

"Great! Just entered this small world, and already fighting with the people of this world!" Du Hongxi and others had excited expressions. They'd been cooped up in the Star River Palace for too long, and now they were eager to fight a battle to let this world's people know their presence.

"Buzz..." Yao Chen, Wang Wang, Jun Wulei, and Meng Xue rushed with overwhelming auras toward the masters who had lived through two lives and were attacking Gut Tianshu.

"Damn it!" The Ancient Kings immediately panicked, gazing at the unfamiliar Du Hongxi and others. Their eyes showed intense fear.

"Damn it, you enjoyed fighting with more people before, right?" The Nine Realms' people were furious. Their bodies radiated terrifying auras, rushing toward the Ancient Kings' prodigies.

"Are you afraid of us?" The Ancient Kings' prodigies became疯狂, no longer as casual as before. Their auras surged upward, rushing toward Jiang Nanxuan and others.

The stars exploded. The entire Thunder Realm became a forbidden zone, with violent fluctuations radiating from it. Even epoch peak masters couldn't enter the Thunder Realm.

While both sides fought bloodily, Luo Tian sat beneath the Star River Palace's stars, his expression solemn. His body radiated waves of divine laws surrounding him.

"Almost there... almost there..." Luo Tian muttered to himself, excited. He felt the Heavenly Dao Foundation Pill in his dantian was weakening, and the轮回通道 (Cyclic Passage) was gradually transforming. He felt his current state was incredibly strong.

"Did it succeed?" In the small room, the Star River Palace's spirit and others looked with admiration at Luo Tian, whose aura was overwhelming.

"It should be fine. He didn't explode, so his flesh and blood are really abnormal!" They whispered among themselves, gazing at Luo Tian.

Time passed slowly. The Heavenly Dao Foundation Pill in Luo Tian's dantian grew weaker and weaker, finally crumbling under his excitement.

"Buzz..." Without hesitation, Luo Tian's technique immediately refined the scattered divine energy. He slowly opened his eyes.

"A powerful feeling!" Luo Tian clenched his fists, now that the Cyclic Passage in his dantian was fully formed. It radiated waves of divine power, with divine energy flowing within the Cyclic Passage. A smile appeared on Luo Tian's face.

"If I use martial arts, it can fully support me!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. He pointed his finger, and a strand of divine energy hovered at the tip.

"Good, go out to face the heavenly tribulation. Once you pass it, you'll become a Heavenly Dao Realm master!" The Star River Palace's spirit smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Thank you, elder!" Luo Tian bowed to the Star River Palace's spirit. Although there was a risk of being crushed by the Heavenly Dao Foundation Pill, anyone else would have taken the chance.

"However, this isn't urgent. I still have something to do!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing the old man beside the spirit: "Please elder, send me back to the crimson battlefield. I need to finish off one person!"

"Ah, good!" The old man with a cold face nodded. He had previously looked down on Luo Tian but now changed his attitude, as Luo Tian had succeeded. Once he passed the heavenly tribulation, Luo Tian would become a Heavenly Dao Realm master.

After finishing his words, the old man waved his hand. The scene around them changed instantly, appearing beneath crimson skies.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian took a step forward and immediately appeared at the location where they had previously set up an imprisonment seal for Qiu Jingming. His face showed admiration.

"I didn't expect to finish you so quickly!" Luo Tian muttered, pointing his finger. Divine power surged, and a strand of divine light burst from his fingertip, appearing before the black mountain.

"Crush..." The seals previously set by Luo Tian and others instantly shattered under that divine light strand.

"Rise..." Luo Tian waved his hand, and the black mountain instantly rose. Qiu Jingming, wrapped in seals, was revealed.

"Who... who helped me break the seal?" Qiu Jingming was extremely weak but his mind was clear.

Chapter 1738: Heavenly Dao's Tribulation

"It's me!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Qiu Jingming, who looked like a skeleton. His voice carried coldness.

"Luo Tian..." Qiu Jingming's eyes, which had just risen with hope, dimmed immediately. He looked at Luo Tian: "Did you come to your senses? Are you going to kill me?"

"Yes, I've come to my senses. I won't imprison you anymore!" Luo Tian nodded, grabbing Qiu Jingming.

"Grandmaster, send me out of the Star River Palace!" Luo Tian nodded, gazing at the Star River Palace's spirit. His sense of panic grew stronger.

"Good! Don't forget our instructions!" The Star River Palace's spirit smiled, then spoke to Luo Tian. He waved his hand, and a golden gate appeared before Luo Tian.

"Then I'll take my leave!" Luo Tian bowed to the others, then took Qiu Jingming and stepped into the golden gate.

"Hope he can ascend!" The Star River Palace's spirit looked with admiration at the disappearing golden gate.

"Buzz..." A moment later, Luo Tian appeared outside the Star River Palace. His face showed a smile, then he looked at Qiu Jingming, who was barely alive in his hands.

"You..." Qiu Jingming looked at Luo Tian's gaze, despairing. He hadn't expected that Luo Tian would bring him out of the Star River Palace.

Moreover, Qiu Jingming felt a desperate aura on Luo Tian. This aura was only slightly weaker than that of the previous Duan Tian's Master.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded, knowing what Qiu Jingming was thinking. He spoke again: "You didn't expect it, did you? In the end, you died at my hands!"

Luo Tian waved his hand, and divine energy enveloped Qiu Jingming. The ultimate refining power instantly surrounded Qiu Jingming.

"Ah..." Qiu Jingming screamed, his flesh and blood were annihilated by the divine energy. At the same time, Qiu Jingming's powerful soul appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

"I'm not willing! I'm not willing!" Qiu Jingming roared, his voice filled with anger. He had survived for so many years but hadn't taken that final step. Now, this boy who had lived less time than him had succeeded.

"It's no use being unwilling!" Luo Tian sighed softly. Although he marveled at Qiu Jingming's brilliance, he showed no mercy. He reached out into the void.

"Boom..." A strand of divine energy instantly annihilated Qiu Jingming, who was already weak. Thus, the great power Qiu Jingming, who hadn't even been crushed by Duan Tian's Master, vanished completely.

"Time to return!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He took a step forward and immediately stepped out of the Star River Ancient Path, appearing on the platform of the Celestial Palace.

"Damn it!" As soon as Luo Tian appeared, his face changed abruptly. He cursed under his breath and moved swiftly, disappearing from the Celestial Palace platform into the blood-stained stars of Star Realm.

"Thunder Realm!" Luo Tian instantly sensed the battle in the Thunder Realm. He didn't bother with the massive battles within the Thunder Realm.

However, as soon as Luo Tian took a step, the entire starry sky suddenly darkened. A powerful pressure instantly descended upon Star Realm.

"What's going on!" The overwhelming pressure made the people in Star Realm and the Ancient Kings' forces look terrified. Under this pressure, they felt like ants.

"Damn it! They came so fast!" Luo Tian's face also looked grim. He hadn't expected to face the heavenly tribulation immediately after leaving the Star River Palace.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian waved his hands, sending out waves. Then he spread them outward, enveloping the entire Star Realm.

As the waves continued to transmit, both human and Ancient Kings forces disappeared from their original positions, appearing outside Star Realm.

"Am I being moved out?" People flashed around. Everyone's faces showed disbelief, gazing at the dense crowd surrounding them. Whether human or Ancient Kings, they were all shocked and forgot about the battle.

"Moving an entire star realm's people! This method is too terrifying!" People were shocked, gazing at the now dark Star Realm.

"Who is it?" Everyone was stunned but also puzzled, feeling that a formidable person had appeared in the Nine Realms.

"Buzz..." The black stars were deathly silent. Luo Tian stood beneath them, his face solemn as his aura rose.

"I'll see if this strongest heavenly tribulation is truly remarkable!" Luo Tian muttered, feeling a闷 (tightness) in his chest.

"Boom... boom..." The deep thunder sounded. A series of lightning dragons roamed beneath the black stars, their overwhelming pressure making even Luo Tian, who had just transformed, feel a sense of fear.

"Thunder tribulation? Then it's too uninteresting!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, gazing at the lightning dragons gradually gathering in the black sky.

"Crack..." As Luo Tian's words finished, seven-color lightning illuminated the entire sky. The light of thunder shone brilliantly.

It could seemingly annihilate everything, seven-color lightning with the power to destroy all beings. It rose under the black stars, lighting up the entire sky.

"Is this a heavenly tribulation? My mother! The first heavenly tribulation is seven-color lightning! I've never seen a seven-color lightning heavenly tribulation before!" People exclaimed, even if they weren't in Star Realm. Seeing the thick seven-color lightning, their hearts trembled.

Luo Tian smiled, this seven-color lightning wasn't his first time seeing. Previously in the Star River Palace, Longwei Lishi had spat out some as well. However, compared to this one, it was ten thousand miles behind. The area alone was several streets ahead of the seven-color lightning spat out by Longwei Lishi, completely different levels.

"Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao!" Luo Tian smiled, waving his hand to retrieve the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao.

"Buzz..." A longing aura was transmitted from the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao, trembling slightly in Luo Tian's hand.

"Go!" Luo Tian released his grip. The Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao radiated brilliant light, instantly flying out and rushing toward the seven-color lightning.

In an instant, the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao was bathed in the seven-color lightning. Luo Tian's face showed admiration.

"This lightning is strong, but it has become food for the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao. I wonder if the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao can upgrade to a lower-grade divine weapon after absorbing this lightning tribulation!" Luo Tian muttered, also familiarizing himself with his body's state. After all, he had just ascended.

The seven-color lightning twisted. In an instant, it was completely absorbed by the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao. The seven-color lightning vanished instantly, and the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao returned to Luo Tian's hand.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion, gazing at the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao in his hand. After absorbing the seven-color lightning tribulation, the sword's aura had rapidly declined. A series of thunder-like seals covered the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao.

"Is it nurturing its fourth lightning?" Luo Tian felt the changes in the Divine Lightning Sword of the Heavenly Dao. Although it had lost its previous sharpness, it seemed to have returned to simplicity, giving a profound sense.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was confused, in the dark stars, more light rose. A seemingly gentle mark floated in the dark stars, making Luo Tian's face slightly change.

"Heavenly Dao Mark!" Luo Tian spoke in shock. Then his eyes flashed with light. At this moment, he knew that once he fused the Heavenly Dao Mark, he would become a Heavenly Dao Realm master—unparalleled in history, the epoch master who dominated nine heavens and ten earths.

At the moment the gentle mark appeared, all epoch peak masters in the Nine Realms felt a resonance. Their faces showed shock.

"Proving one's path!" In the Thunder Realm, Gu Tianshu and other masters who had lived through two lives stopped their hands, speaking softly.

"Who is it? Who has drawn out the Heavenly Dao Mark? Someone is about to prove their path!" The royal heirs of the Ancient Kings showed shock. They hadn't expected someone to prove their path at this time.

"In Star Realm!" Almost everyone instantly looked toward the direction of Star Realm, even forgetting the battle. They all stopped their attacks and flew toward the direction of Star Realm. At this moment, both human and Ancient Kings people in the Nine Realms had an unspoken agreement to stop fighting, wanting to witness this scene that few in history had ever seen.

"Damn it! No matter who you are, I won't let you prove your path. This epoch belongs to me alone!" All the Ancient Kings' royal heirs and prodigies roared, their hearts filled with fear.

"Is it Luo Tian?" People from the Four Sacred Star Realms were also stunned, their eyes showing excitement. They knew Luo Tian was still in the Star River Palace and hadn't emerged yet. Since the one proving their path was in Star Realm, it could be Luo Tian!

"It must be him. I can't think of anyone else!" They all shouted in their hearts, eyes showing excitement as they flew toward the direction of Star Realm.

"The commotion is too big!" Luo Tian stood beneath the dark stars, his gaze showing a bitter smile. He could feel countless overwhelming auras rushing toward Star Realm.

"Crack..." As everyone rushed to Star Realm, the four statues on Tianyuan Continent's Heavenly Dao Mountain emitted a sound of cracking. They seemed to be pulled by Luo Tian's opportunity to prove his path, with waves of vitality surrounding them. Four powerful fluctuations slowly revived.

"It's not that simple!" Luo Tian gazed at the gentle mark beneath the stars, not moving. His gaze was deep as he looked at the pitch-black stars.

Chapter 1739: It's Him

Beneath the black stars, a mark floated there, casting waves of light. This mark could make anyone in the Nine Realms go mad because merging with it was a form of recognition, an acknowledgment to reach higher levels.

Luo Tian stood beneath the stars, gazing at the mark. He didn't act rashly because he knew this mark wouldn't let him absorb and refine it so easily.

"Buzz..." As expected, a piercing buzz echoed in the stars. At the same time, terrifying pressure descended again. Blood-red eyes slowly opened, as if two whirlpools, absorbing the blood from the previous battle in Star Realm.

A series of blood rivers flowed beneath the stars, making Luo Tian's face show a solemn expression. He felt this heavenly tribulation was unusual.

As Luo Tian marveled, waves of energy spread from the blood-red eyes. In an instant, a blood figure appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

One... ten...

In the blink of an eye, ninety-nine figures emerged. Each was a powerful figure blocking Luo Tian and the Heavenly Dao Mark.

"Kill..." Without hesitation, Luo Tian knew these ninety-nine blood figures were likely manifestations of the elusive Heavenly Dao. He brandished his spear and rushed toward them.

"Buzz..." In an instant, the ninety-nine blood figures moved. They instantly shattered before Luo Tian's eyes and reformed again. A blood-colored long bow and a blood-colored arrow formed in Luo Tian's vision.

The blood-colored arrow was placed on the long bow. The string slightly bent, and then the sound of the string vibrating echoed in the stars.

"Buzz..." The arrow transformed into a blood-red streak, rushing toward Luo Tian. In an instant, it was at Luo Tian's front, making his body pause.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath. He hadn't expected these ninety-nine blood figures to pull this move.

"Unexpected!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart. His body suddenly turned around. He felt the blood arrow was unusual. At this point, few things could make him feel a threat. Even masters who had lived through two lives couldn't suppress him.

"Whoa..." A series of divine laws flowed within the blood arrow, circling Luo Tian in the stars.

"What is this thing!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He felt the blood arrow was getting closer to him. Then he gritted his teeth and stopped running, turning around and suddenly punching.

"Buzz..." The Cyclic Passage in Luo Tian's dantian emitted a buzzing sound. At the same time, a series of divine seals appeared on Luo Tian's arms, making his punch incredibly powerful. This was the Dao Sealing Magic he often used.

In an instant, the blood arrow collided with Luo Tian's fist. Waves of sharpness surged toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The blood arrow shattered, turning into a series of blood droplets floating in the stars. At the same time, Luo Tian's body was instantly pushed back, his flesh and blood shaking with immense power.

"Good, it's still within an acceptable range!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart. He gazed again at the blood figure slowly forming.

"One less..." Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed. He stood there, but despite one fewer blood figure, a bad feeling arose in his heart.

"Rippling..." The blood figure transformed into a sea of blood, covering the stars. Then it reformed again. In an instant, a blood-colored seal appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

"Buzz..." An invisible wave spread from the blood-colored seal, as if the entire starry sky only contained this blood-colored seal. The three big characters "Shake the Heavens" were engraved on its base.

"Come on!" Luo Tian roared, standing proudly beneath the stars. From the moment he started his tribulation, he knew this one would be extremely difficult. Otherwise, why had only one epoch master appeared in an entire epoch?

The thunderous sound echoed. The blood-colored seal pressed down everything. In an instant, it hovered above Luo Tian's head. Before the seal fell, overwhelming pressure poured out, making Luo Tian's robe flutter.

"Open!" Luo Tian waved his hands. A golden vortex emerged from his hands, and a golden seal gradually formed within the vortex. The golden seal also carried an immense pressure, with misty vapor surrounding it, as if the vortex communicated with the divine realm.

"Crack..." In an instant, two seals—one golden and one blood—collided. An invisible wave spread outward. Surprisingly, the black stars were unaffected by this violent wave, appearing unusually stable.

"My god! Who is that!" People outside Star Realm watching Luo Tian's tribulation trembled. They didn't dare to step into Star Realm, feeling that if they did, they would be annihilated.

"Nine-seven..." Luo Tian took a deep breath and gazed at the ninety-nine figures again, his eyes showing solemnity.

"Each attack reduces one. That means there are still ninety-seven attacks waiting for me!" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes showing battle spirit.

"Fight! I didn't manage to suppress me back then. How can you suppress me now!" Luo Tian roared, his hands moving rapidly. His Divine Form of the Universe activated, and his body expanded dramatically, resembling a giant who stood against the heavens.

"That's..."

"Luo Tian..." As Luo Tian activated his Divine Form of the Universe, people finally saw his figure. Their eyes showed disbelief.

"It's Luo Tian! Did he prove his path?" People looked at him with reverence, gazing at the Luo Tian who was now battling a blood-colored seal.

At this moment, everyone had deep respect for Luo Tian. This included the Ancient Kings and even those who had been his enemies before, all admiring how he had reached such a level.

"Seeing someone prove their path is worth living for!" People whispered among themselves, eyes fixed on the towering Luo Tian.

"Blood-colored seal... blood-colored ancient bell..." A series of attacks resembling martial arts continuously attacked Luo Tian.

Luo Tian radiated overwhelming aura, constantly resisting each attack. Each blood figure gradually decreased in number. However, after each decrease, the next attack became stronger.

"Nine-five... eighty..." Luo Tian seemed to have transcended. At the same time, he continuously counted the number of blood figures in his mind.

Time passed slowly. Under people's watchful eyes, Luo Tian endured the impact of a blood-colored mountain with his unparalleled flesh and blood. He spat blood, his body bent, constantly emitting cracking sounds.

"The last one..." Luo Tian's face was pale. He wiped the blood from his lips but his eyes remained bright. His gaze locked onto the last blood figure beside the Heavenly Dao Mark.

Although Luo Tian had resisted each attack, his body was also severely injured. After all, each of those attacks could have killed him before he had refined the Heavenly Dao Foundation Pill.

"Boom..." The blood figure exploded, then in Luo Tian's expectation, it slowly reformed into a blood-colored spear.

"Buzz..." Two red glows burst from the crimson eyes, engraving themselves into the blood-colored spear. This made the spear's aura even more terrifying.

"A sense of crisis..." A strong feeling of danger arose in Luo Tian's heart. He felt this blood-colored spear was different from the previous attacks.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was shocked, red light flashed. The blood-colored spear instantly disappeared from Luo Tian's vision and appeared before him.

"Pu..." As Luo Tian realized, the blood-colored spear had already reached his front and pierced into his body.

"Damn it..." Luo Tian twisted his body, knowing he couldn't escape. He tried to avoid the vital points.

Coldness spread throughout Luo Tian's body, making his face even paler. From a distance, people saw that Luo Tian's massive body was pierced through by the blood-colored spear. It looked terrifying.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian roared upward, grabbing the blood-colored spear with his hands. He tried to pull it out but found that the blood-colored spear was as if embedded in his body, unable to move at all.

The most frustrating thing for Luo Tian was that the blood-colored spear emitted waves, continuously draining his flesh and blood vitality as well as the divine energy from his dantian's Cyclic Passage.

"Out..." Luo Tian kept shouting, his thick arms with bulging veins. He didn't continue to pull it out but instead slapped the blood-colored spear, forcing it to pierce through his body from the back.

"Pu..." Blood light flashed. Luo Tian's actions indeed had an effect. The blood-colored spear exited from the back of his body.
