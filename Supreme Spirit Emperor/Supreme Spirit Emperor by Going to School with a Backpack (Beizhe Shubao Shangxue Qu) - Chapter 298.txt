“Have you arrived?” Luo Tian's heart stirred as he gazed upon the figures before him. The leader was a middle-aged man, somewhat plump, with small eyes that seemed perpetually smiling. Yet within those tiny eyes flickered waves of divine radiance, giving him an amiable appearance. However, Luo Tian sensed a dangerous aura emanating from the corpulent man.

The middle-aged man's cultivation was also at the half-step Era level, accompanied by disciples exuding saintly presence. Their gazes carried an air of authority as they scrutinized Luo Tian.

“Respectful greetings, Third Island Master!” The several transcendent-level disciples who had previously blocked Luo Tian displayed reverence as they bowed to the plump middle-aged man. They were well aware of the Third Island Master's formidable nature. Though he appeared amiable on the surface, within the Seven Star Island, from the Grand Master down to the common disciples, all knew that the Third Island Master was the most devious among them. The disciples of Seven Star Island referred to him as the most cunning island master.

“What's the situation?” As Luo Tian observed the Third Island Master, the latter also scrutinized Luo Tian. Their eyes met, and the Third Island Master's small eyes narrowed slightly, emitting waves of divine brilliance.

“Third Island Master, this man has an elder with him. They have just entered the Seven Star Island through a spiritual jade pendant. We conducted routine checks, but they were obstructed. The elder directly subdued us with his cultivation and then left, entering the Seven Star Island while this youth remained here.” Facing the half-step Era-level Third Island Master, the youths did not dare to be careless and reported truthfully.

“Respectful younger brother Luo Tian. I apologize for the previous disturbances; I hope Third Island Master will not hold it against me.” Luo Tian clasped his fists, addressing himself as a junior despite not showing excessive reverence. After all, he was also at the half-step Era level. In a world where strength reigned supreme, one's power represented everything. If not for the elder's age, Luo Tian would have even refrained from calling himself a junior.

“Ah… Luo Tian? Where did you come from?” Shen Gongfu's face remained smiling as he spoke softly.

“Forgive me for my hesitation, but I can swear blood oaths that I am truly a human race member and not an infiltrator from the蛮族 or another royal clan.” Luo Tian's face bore a look of hesitation, glancing at the people around him. If news of his belonging to the Nine Realms spread, it would inevitably cause unnecessary trouble.

“Hm.” Shen Gongfu's small eyes reflected contemplation as he rubbed his plump chin, pondering for a while. “The matters of the Seven Star Island are beyond my authority. Since your strength is formidable, I cannot simply accept your word to let you reside in the Seven Star Island. Go with me to meet the other island masters.”

Shen Gongfu smiled, leading his disciples into the heart of the Seven Star Island.

“Ah… well.” Luo Tian shook his head lightly and followed Shen Gongfu, his mind filled with questions.

He had previously heard from the Thunderbird and the Dragon Whale that although the Seven Star Island appeared as a large island, it was actually divided into seven smaller islands. Each had an island master who held absolute power over their respective islands. Clearly, the island where Luo Tian and the Dragon Whale had landed was the Third Island. Yet why did this plump man claim he could not allow him to stay?

Luo Tian's mind was filled with thoughts as he followed Shen Gongfu deeper into the island.

Along the way, Luo Tian noticed many human race members. He sighed in relief, finally seeing humans and hoping to live a normal life. Although the South Ridge Stone寨's lifestyle was comfortable, he found it somewhat difficult to adapt. A short stay was fine, but if he stayed too long, he felt something might go wrong.

The group moved swiftly. After about a quarter of an hour, they arrived at a mountain peak. The entire mountain was green, brimming with vitality and giving an aura of peace.

A fragrant aroma drifted from the mountain's summit, stirring Luo Tian's heart. His eyebrows slightly lifted, and a smile appeared in his eyes.

“Let’s go!” Shen Gongfu waved away several disciples, directly teleporting Luo Tian into a grand hall.

“Now it's just us. I ask you, are you willing to join our Third Island?” Shen Gongfu directly addressed Luo Tian.

“Respectful elder, weren’t you going to take me to meet the Grand Master?” Luo Tian smiled lightly, scanning Shen Gongfu's face.

“Yes, I do need to meet him. Your identity must be verified by the other island masters. However, I can directly let you reside in the Third Island and even appoint you as Deputy Island Master!” Shen Gongfu rubbed his hands, gazing at Luo Tian with a merchant-like gleam in his eyes.

“Why?” Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed. Years of experience made him feel that Shen Gongfu was setting a trap for him.

“What must I do?” Luo Tian spoke softly. He knew there were no such things as free gifts in the world. Shen Gongfu's generous treatment must have had a purpose.

“Nothing much. You are at the half-step Era level, and your strength matches mine. Naturally, you have the qualifications to hold this Deputy Island Master position!” Shen Gongfu shook his head, gazing at Luo Tian with sincerity in his small eyes.

“Alright,” Luo Tian nodded. He sighed inwardly, thinking that he had nothing to lose now. If things went wrong, he could just walk away. He believed that with the Dragon Whale's presence, there weren't many people in the Seven Star Island who would dare to offend him. At least, the visible island masters wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

“Go rest for now. Tomorrow I'll take you to meet the other island masters and verify your loyalty. If there's no treachery, then you'll become my Third Island's Deputy Island Master!” Shen Gongfu spoke to Luo Tian and had a young disciple lead him out of the hall.

“This Deputy Island Master position is finally settled. The old-timers probably won't have anything to say, right? A half-step Era level cultivator. I didn’t expect my Shen Gongfu to be so clever, solving the problem at once and even recruiting a half-step Era strength. Ha!” Shen Gongfu muttered to himself, his face filled with satisfaction.

“Brother, I apologize for the previous disturbances. Please don’t take it personally,” Luo Tian smiled and patted the front of a large fat man, speaking softly. This big man was the transcendent-level disciple who had been knocked down twice by Luo Tian's aura earlier.

“Where, but it’s you, Brother. At such a young age, reaching the half-step Era level is truly admirable. Now we are allies. If you need anything in the future, just tell me. I am Shen Gongfei and will spare no effort!” The small fat man patted his thick chest and spoke loudly.

“Hey, Shen Gongfei. Have you improved your skills recently?” As Shen Gongfei's words finished, a mocking voice echoed in Luo Tian and Shen Gongfei’s ears.

“Ge Yuanzheng?” Shen Gongfei's face changed, looking at the approaching figures and speaking softly.

“Just look at your bear-like appearance. Do you dare to imitate others?” Ge Yuanzheng's face showed disdain as he addressed Shen Gongfei.

“I… I didn’t say I was imitating anyone!” Shen Gongfei's face turned red, his gaze on Ge Yuanzheng revealing a sense of委屈. His mind muttered that this person didn’t need him to imitate.

Shen Gongfei held a relatively high position within the Third Island, being related to the island master Shen Gongfu. Thus, he lived comfortably within the Third Island. However, his talent was ordinary, and some disciples looked down on him. Ultimately, because he had some connections, Shen Gongfei was merely a disciple who relied on his elders' favor to reach his current transcendent-level cultivation.

“Shen Gongfei, I told you before. Once I see you, I’ll beat you. Have you forgotten?” Ge Yuanzheng clenched his fists lightly, a sinister expression on his face as he and his disciples approached Shen Gongfei.

“I only stole one medicinal herb from you. Why are you so resentful?” Shen Gongfei's face turned red as he addressed Ge Yuanzheng.

“Yes, I am that petty. Especially when I see your fat face, I want to stomp it twice. What should I do?” Ge Yuanzheng smiled, his half-step saintly aura suddenly surged. His green fist smashed toward Shen Gongfei's face.

Luo Tian smiled all the while, standing beside Shen Gongfei as he watched the situation unfold. However, since Shen Gongfei was with him and treated him kindly, Luo Tian naturally couldn’t let Shen Gongfei be bullied.

Faced with such an opponent, Luo Tian was too lazy to fight. He released his aura, directly sending Ge Yuanzheng flying backward.

“Plop…” Ge Yuanzheng landed on the ground awkwardly, his face filled with resentment. He only then noticed Luo Tian and saw the disdain in his eyes, blood spilling from his mouth.

“Who are you? You’re not a disciple of my Third Island. Why do you interfere in my island’s affairs!” Ge Yuanzheng stood up, sensing Luo Tian's strength and remaining in place as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Let’s go. Take me to my residence!” Luo Tian shook his head, not even bothering to speak to Ge Yuanzheng. He walked away with his hands behind his back, pulling Shen Gongfei who was excited, stepping on Ge Yuanzheng's face as he passed.

“Damn it!” Ge Yuanzheng’s face was filled with resentment, watching Luo Tian and Shen Gongfei leave. His eyes flashed a hint of hatred.

“Senior, this kid seems strong!” One disciple spoke, his eyes filled with awe.

“Smack…” Ge Yuanzheng turned and slapped the disciple, venting his anger from Luo Tian onto him. He roared: “Why did you say that!”

“Senior Ge, is this the end of it?” A disciple cautiously stood beside Ge Yuanzheng and addressed him.

“End? No one who harms me has ever had a good outcome in the Third Island!” Ge Yuanzheng coldly spoke, his body flickering as he flew toward a mountain peak.

“Is Senior Ge going to the Second Guardian?” The disciples felt their hearts tighten, gazing at the direction Ge Yuanzheng left. It was the location of the Third Island's Guardian Hall.

“Probably. I don’t know who this young man is, but he’s close to Shen Gongfei. He must have some connection with the island master,” they discussed.

“Thank you, Luo Senior. You’ve helped me out today. If it weren’t for you, I might have been beaten again!” Shen Gongfei looked at Luo Tian with respect.

“Alright, tell me about the Third Island and Seven Star Island situation,” Luo Tian didn’t want to think about how Ge Yuanzheng would retaliate. He now knew that the Third Island had only two half-step Era cultivators: the island master Shen Gongfu and a young prodigy disciple Hu Tianzong. As for others, Luo Tian found them unimpressive.

“Speaking of our Third Island, its status within the Seven Star Island is unparalleled. It even surpasses the Second Island slightly. Luo Senior, do you know why?” Shen Gongfei seemed very talkative, his words flowing as he thoroughly explained the situation of the Seven Star Island and Third Island.

“Ah, I see!” Luo Tian smiled, listening carefully to Shen Gongfei’s account. He sighed inwardly; this Third Island was indeed suitable for him because of its unique aspect—its alchemy.

“Long time since I’ve cultivated elixirs!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, gently patting his storage bag. Inside were stacks of energy stones, approximately a million in number. These were given by the Dragon Whale during his stay in the Seven Star Sea. Though compared to the countless energy stones he had before, it was far inferior.

However, Luo Tian knew that in the荒蛮大陆 (Vast Wilds), energy stones were extremely scarce. The South Ridge Stone寨 couldn’t even produce three thousand, which indicated the preciousness of energy stones in this world.

“We have seven prodigies in the Seven Star Island. The first is naturally the Grand Master’s disciple, Guan Xingjian, at the half-step Era level. His sword, the Observatory Sword, is masterful and invincible within the Seven Star Island. It’s said that Grand Master Jiang Taihong has already appointed Guan Xingjian as Deputy Island Master. I believe that when Guan Xingjian reaches the early Era, he will become the Island Master of the First Island,”

“Of course, our Third Island also has one among the seven prodigies—Hu Tianzong. His strength is formidable. He once competed with Guan Xingjian and only lost by a single move!” Shen Gongfei’s face was filled with admiration as he described this to Luo Tian.

“Indeed, very formidable!” Luo Tian smiled, noting the names of both in his mind.

“The rest of the seniors are all at the saintly peak level. There’s nothing to say about them, but they’re still formidable among those at the saintly peak,” Shen Gongfei continued.

“Do you have any elixirs? Could you give me one to see?” Luo Tian smiled and asked Shen Gongfei.

As they spoke, they arrived at the temporary residence prepared by Shen Gongfu for Luo Tian. Entering the courtyard.

“Elixirs?” Shen Gongfei’s face turned serious, then contemplative. He seemed to have made a decision and waved his hand, producing an exquisite jade bottle in his hands. His eyes showed strong reluctance but finally bit his teeth and handed it to Luo Tian.

“Luo Senior, this is the best elixir I have. It was crafted by the Grand Guardian, a Saintly Grade Initial Elixir—Convergence of Saintly Elixir!” Shen Gongfei’s face showed pride as he explained.

“It's because of this elixir that I offended Ge Yuanzheng. It was due to the medicinal herbs he coveted,” Shen Gongfei’s face showed regret.

Luo Tian nodded. Convergence of Saintly Elixir—he had also cultivated it before, aiding in increasing the chances of entering the saintly realm. However, its effectiveness was extremely poor, barely reaching one-tenth.

“Hum…” Luo Tian opened the jade bottle. Waves of energy radiated from it, spreading into his courtyard.

Luo Tian’s eyebrows slightly furrowed. He turned the bottle upside down, and a golden elixir fell into his hand. His eyes showed disdain as he slightly curled his lips: “You call this elixir?”

In his view, the elixir was round but had several barely noticeable pits. From his perspective, it was clearly an improperly formed elixir due to uneven distribution of spiritual awareness. Moreover, the medicinal properties were too low. In Luo Tian’s eyes, this elixir was truly inferior.

“This… is an elixir? And it's crafted by the Grand Guardian!” Shen Gongfei’s face showed confusion, looking at Luo Tian’s clear disdain and explaining.

“Hmph… a waste of medicinal herbs’ potency. This is a Saintly Grade High-level alchemist, and his elixir-making technique is too crude!” Luo Tian sighed involuntarily.

“Luo Senior, do you also understand alchemy?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Shen Gongfei’s eyes showed a hint of confusion and asked.

“Understand a little,” Luo Tian nodded, his eyes showing confidence. If it came to alchemy, no one in the Nine Realms could match him except for five fingers.

“Ha! Luo Senior truly is a prodigy, not only with his cultivation but also with alchemy!” Shen Gongfei’s face showed a hint of admiration as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Unfortunately, my alchemy furnace isn’t with me. I don’t have any medicinal herbs either. Otherwise, I could offer you a few times better elixirs!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly and then looked at Shen Gongfei: “There should be places to sell alchemy furnaces and medicinal herbs on our island. Tomorrow, come with me to buy one furnace and some medicinal herbs!”

“Ah, yes!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Shen Gongfei quickly agreed, his eyes filled with excitement. He wanted to see what kind of elixirs Luo Tian would cultivate.

“You can go back now. Come find me tomorrow afternoon!” Luo Tian addressed Shen Gongfei, watching the excited Shen Gongfei leave. Then he entered his room.

“Alchemy? My alchemy should now be at the Saintly Grade High level. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to improve it!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly and took out several stone scrolls, placing them on the table.

These stone scrolls were ancient formulas passed down by the Stone Clan when Luo Tian was in the South Ridge Stone寨. They had various miraculous effects, which he had obtained. He always felt that the ancient formulas of the Stone寨 were connected to elixirs.

Chapter 1238: Deputy Island Master

“Perhaps the ancient formula for body refinement used by the蛮族 (barbarians) is similar to elixirs, or even might be elixirs themselves!” Luo Tian looked at the stone scrolls on the table, his face showing confusion.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian picked up the first stone scroll and found messy handwriting—‘Convergence of Blood Elixir’ appeared in his vision.

“Convergence of Blood Elixir, refining the blood within the body to enhance bloodline strength!” Luo Tian directly found the introduction of Convergence of Blood Elixir, his face showing a hint of joy.

“The蛮族 don’t cultivate elixirs. Perhaps the alchemy tradition has long been severed. This formula might have been passed down by the barbarians’ descendants, who only know to put medicinal herbs into a pot and refine their bloodline quality!” Luo Tian was overjoyed, looking at the stone scrolls as if he had found treasure.

“Excellent elixirs. The蛮族 focuses on refining the body, and these formulas are all for enhancing bloodline and physical strength. They’re precious!” Luo Tian scanned several elixir formulas, already having a rough idea.

“Bloodline and physical strength can be enhanced. That’s why the蛮族's bodies are so strong. Relying solely on physical strength, they became one of the ancient royal clans. Perhaps these ancient elixir formulas were also methods that made them strong. I never expected they would end up in my hands. I believe there must be alchemists who understand elixirs within the蛮神殿 (Barbarian God Palace). However, their alchemy skills must be poor; otherwise, the蛮族 wouldn’t have declined so much!” Luo Tian muttered quietly.

“First, I’ll meet the other island masters tomorrow. Then I can start cultivating elixirs. Without even a single elixir, it’s quite inconvenient, especially in this蛮族大陆 (Barbarian Continent), where elixirs are a major advantage!” Luo Tian sat cross-legged on his bed, closing his eyes to cultivate.

Time slowly passed. One night, Luo Tian adjusted his state to its peak and stepped out of the door into the courtyard.

“Here you are,” Shen Gongfu smiled, sensing Luo Tian’s arrival and stepping out of the courtyard. His gaze fell on Luo Tian.

“Respectful greetings, Island Master!” Luo Tian slightly bowed. After all, he was the island master; respect had to be given.

“Enough with these formalities. Let’s go!” Shen Gongfu waved his hand, transforming into a long rainbow and flying toward the east of the Third Island.

Luo Tian smiled, watching Shen Gongfu’s fading figure and not caring. He took a step forward, using the幽冥鬼步 (Yin Shadow Ghost Step), and instantly appeared before Shen Gongfu.

“Hmph, kid. Let me give you a warning first; otherwise, once you become Deputy Island Master, you might not respect me. That would be a problem!” Shen Gongfu’s face showed satisfaction. He was skilled in speed, and few could match his speed at the same level. He didn’t think Luo Tian could catch up, so he intentionally increased his speed to intimidate Luo Tian.

“Island Master’s speed is quite good!” But as Shen Gongfu was satisfied, a gust of wind rose behind him. Luo Tian’s voice echoed in Shen Gongfu’s ears.

“Hm?” Shen Gongfu was startled, looking at the calm Luo Tian following him. His eyes showed a hint of surprise: “His speed is almost equal to mine!”

“Ah, Deputy Island Master’s speed isn’t slow either!” Shen Gongfu chuckled twice, masking his embarrassment. His fat face trembled.

The two flew swiftly, becoming two golden lights. In an instant, they reached the center of the Seven Star Island. From high above, Luo Tian saw seven islands arranged like the Big Dipper.

“Let’s go!” Shen Gongfu flew down, heading toward the central island. That was the most core island of the Seven Star Island.

Compared to the Third Island, the First Island was much larger. The people within it had stronger auras and weren’t as lazy as the Third Island.

Shen Gongfu, the Third Island Master, was known by everyone in the Seven Star Island. In a chorus of respectful voices, Shen Gongfu led Luo Tian to a position within the First Island—a golden mountain.

“This is the Sword Mountain!” Shen Gongfu smiled, speaking to Luo Tian with a sense of pride.

“Grandiose!” Luo Tian’s face showed awe, gazing at the golden mountain before him. It stood like a legendary sharp sword, towering in Luo Tian’s eyes. The entire mountain radiated waves of combat and killing intent, making one shiver.

“This sword mountain was forged by an Era Master who attained enlightenment through the sword. It’s said to be a legendary treasure left by that Era Master for the human race. However, over these years, no one has managed to obtain it.”

“But this sword mountain is a sacred site for sword cultivators. Thus, most of the disciples in the First Island are sword cultivators, entering the Dao through swords,” Shen Gongfu smiled and explained.

“Island Master, our Third Island also has a formidable tradition, right?” Luo Tian suppressed the intense fluctuations of his Wuyaya Sword on his back and asked Shen Gongfu.

“Let’s discuss that after you become Deputy Island Master,” hearing Luo Tian’s words, Shen Gongfu’s eyes flashed a barely noticeable pride as he spoke.

“Let’s go in. I believe the other island masters must be waiting impatiently!” Shen Gongfu took steady steps, his hands behind his back. His plump body trembled as he stepped onto the Sword Mountain.

“I’ll see what old fox you’re up to!” Luo Tian smiled inwardly and followed Shen Gongfu.

As they walked along the path, the more they climbed the mountain, the more Luo Tian felt its uniqueness. Waves of sword energy filled the air, and as they reached higher, the sword energy and killing intent grew stronger, pressing on Luo Tian.

When they reached halfway up the mountain, they stopped before a grand hall. A golden long sword floated above the hall, its golden light casting over the building.

“This sword is called the Seven Star Sword. Our Third Island also has one. If there are invaders, the seven ancient swords can instantly sense and form an ultimate killing formation to eliminate the intruders!” Shen Gongfu spoke, his gaze filled with reverence.

“No wonder the Seven Star Island hasn’t been attacked by the barbarians. To conquer this island, the barbarians would surely suffer heavy losses!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly and followed Shen Gongfu into the hall.

As soon as Luo Tian and Shen Gongfu entered the hall, six gazes instantly enveloped Luo Tian, as if trying to see through him. Especially the two middle-aged men in their fifties and sixties sitting at the front, who gave Luo Tian a powerful pressure.

“Elder Three, is this kid?” One of the middle-aged men spoke from his seat, his voice carrying authority as he looked at Luo Tian and nodded slightly.

“Yes, his cultivation is quite good. At such a young age reaching the half-step Era level—this is rare!” The leading middle-aged man spoke, his voice carrying a hint of amusement.

“Little brother, would you like to join our Fourth Island? We have many female disciples!” A thin middle-aged man approached Luo Tian, slinging his arm around him with a knowing look.

“Elder Four, I brought this kid. You already want to steal him!” Shen Gongfu frowned and kicked the lewd middle-aged man away.

“Ha! When will you two be serious? Elder Three, let me take this kid, right? Benefits, of course, will satisfy you!” One middle-aged man spoke to Shen Gongfu.

“Get lost!” Shen Gongfu shook his head, a satisfied expression on his face. His fat face glowed with light.

“Enough arguing. Let’s first verify this kid’s background!” The leading middle-aged man smiled, and the other five island masters fell silent. A half-step Era cultivator entering the Seven Star Island, and so young—clearly having great potential. For the Seven Star Island, it was a good support.

“This is the First Island Master, Tong Yangjian! The second one is the Second Island Master, Feng Yong. That thin old man is the Fourth Island Master…” As the middle-aged man spoke, Shen Gongfu also transmitted thoughts to Luo Tian, introducing the six people seated in the hall.

“Hm.” Luo Tian nodded. His gaze scanned Tong Yangjian and Feng Yong, who were at the early Era level. The others were all half-step Era cultivators, giving Luo Tian a significant pressure.

“Tell us who you are,” the middle-aged man spoke. The hall fell silent, all eyes on Luo Tian, wanting to know who this sudden strong young man was.

“Respectful younger brother, I come from the Nine Realms!” Luo Tian looked at the seven people in the hall and spoke softly, his voice calm.

“Crack!” In an instant, a crisp sound echoed. Tong Yangjian’s teacup shattered, and his gaze swept over Luo Tian again with lightning-like intensity.

“What did you say?” Feng Yong’s face showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian with hurried breaths.

“You… you…” Shen Gongfu’s fat face trembled. He turned around, pointing his plump finger at Luo Tian, unable to speak.

“You are truly from the Nine Realms!” Luo Tian lightly nodded. He hadn’t expected that saying he was from the Nine Realms would cause such a reaction.

“Which realm of the Nine Realms are you from?” Tong Yangjian quickly regained his composure and asked Luo Tian, his voice turning solemn.

“Fourth Saintly Star Realm!” Luo Tian’s face showed gentleness and a hint of nostalgia as he responded softly.

“True! Few in the Seven Star Island know about the Nine Realms. He’s telling the truth!” Feng Yong’s face showed excitement.

“You entered how?” Tong Yangjian’s eyes were also filled with excitement, gazing at Luo Tian as if seeing a hope of returning to the Nine Realms and rejoining humanity.

Chapter 1239: Verification

In the hall on Sword Mountain of the Seven Star Island, Luo Tian recounted how he had entered the barbarian continent. However, he naturally concealed the matter of the Era Book, as revealing it within the Seven Star Island might bring him unnecessary trouble.

“Amazing. Let’s verify your identity, and then you can reside in the Seven Star Island!” Shen Gongfu sighed deeply, gazing at Luo Tian. The seven island masters led Luo Tian out of the hall and vanished in an instant, appearing on a mountain cliff.

“Go down. If you’re telling the truth, you’ll return alive. If you are an infiltrator from another ancient royal clan, then you know the consequences!” Tong Yangjian addressed Luo Tian.

“Hm.” Luo Tian gazed at the mountain cliff, his face slightly tense. He felt this cliff was no ordinary place. A cold wind passed through his body, making him shiver.

What kind of strength could make Luo Tian feel cold? It was enough to indicate that something terrifying lay beneath the cliff. This deepened Luo Tian’s curiosity about the Seven Star Island, and without hesitation, he leaped off the cliff, disappearing from the sight of the seven island masters.

“Hum…” The chilling air pressed against him. Luo Tian’s body continued to fall, and the powerful coldness enveloped his entire being.

“Five Elements Transformation of Energy!” Luo Tian felt his body could no longer withstand the terrifying coldness. He activated his cultivation technique to resist the cold.

“Plop…” After falling nearly a thousand feet, Luo Tian finally steadied himself on the ground with a heavy sound.

“Crack…” As soon as he landed, cracks appeared under his feet and spread outward.

In the next moment, Luo Tian looked down at his feet. The ground was like a mirror, reflecting his image. All around were icy worlds.

“An extremely cold place. No wonder it's so cold. This temperature could freeze even transcendent-level cultivators!” Luo Tian muttered quietly, looking around and finding no signs of life.

“What’s the test method?” Luo Tian felt puzzled, standing still with a look of confusion, waiting for the test.

“Hum…” In an instant, the ice surface emitted waves of energy. A beam of ultimate path light flew out from the void and instantly illuminated Luo Tian’s body, then the entire icy world was lit up.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian's face broke out in cold sweat. That beam of ultimate path light was truly terrifying, but he was fortunate it didn’t harm him.

As Luo Tian was relieved, the ice surface and surroundings changed. A series of images appeared on the ice, imprinted into Luo Tian’s vision.

“This!” Luo Tian looked at the images covering the icy plain, his face showing a hint of shock. The ice surface showed all his experiences, even the nine reincarnations were clearly revealed.

Although these images were complete, some parts were blurry—everything related to the Era Book was blurred and not revealed.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of admiration, looking at all his experiences as if reliving them. Everything felt like it had happened yesterday and was vividly remembered.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian seemed to be immersed in his world, a roar echoed and the surrounding images shattered into nothingness.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s environment transformed. His feet landed on a transparent altar. Beneath it, a snow-white fierce beast lay prostrate. Even Luo Tian couldn’t recognize what kind of beast it was.

“Hum…” Before Luo Tian could speak, waves of energy passed through him. His figure vanished from the icy world and appeared on the mountain cliff where they had previously been.

“Welcome to the Seven Star Island!” The island masters smiled, addressing Luo Tian with excitement in their eyes.

“We have gained another half-step Era genius. This is truly a cause for celebration!” Tong Yangjian clearly felt good, his gaze on Luo Tian filled with satisfaction.

“Ha! Luo Tian, this is the Deputy Island Master’s token!” Shen Gongfu laughed loudly, licking his belly as he approached Luo Tian and tossed a token into his hands.

“Tsk tsk, Elder Three, you really went all out to recruit this kid!” The other island masters saw Shen Gongfu directly appointing Luo Tian as Deputy Island Master, their faces changed and they spoke softly.

“Of course. Who else wants to recruit?” Shen Gongfu licked his belly, a satisfied expression on his face as he looked at the others.

“Hmph!” Seeing Shen Gongfu’s smug expression, the others felt some resentment but no one dared to oppose appointing Luo Tian as Deputy Island Master. After all, Luo Tian had just arrived at the Seven Star Island. Although there were no problems now, who knew if he would have ulterior motives in the future? No one dared to bet on Luo Tian.

“Deputy Island Master, let’s go!” Shen Gongfu grabbed Luo Tian and, under the sighs of the other island masters, flew out of Sword Mountain toward the Third Island.

Luo Tian had wanted to ask about the progress of returning to the Nine Realms over the years, but he was immediately pulled away by Shen Gongfu and disappeared from the sight of the other island masters on Sword Mountain.

“Sigh, I think I saw this kid was going to have trouble! If Elder Three took an interest in him, he wouldn’t stop until he squeezed every value out of this kid!” The Fourth Island Master showed a hint of regret, gazing at the two lights disappearing.

“Never mind. I heard the Third Island has been somewhat unstable. Let this new kid stir things up!” Tong Yangjian spoke softly, then bowed to the cold cliff below.

“Disperse!” Feng Yong smiled and addressed the others. He also bowed to the cold cliff below, his body flickering as he disappeared from Sword Mountain.

The other island masters also bowed and returned to their respective islands. The mountain cliff once again restored its tranquility.

“Hum…” As the group just disappeared from the clifftop, waves of energy passed through. A senior appeared on the mountain clifftop, his eyes filled with a smile as he gazed at the bottom of the cliff.

“Old comrade, it’s been a while!” The senior spoke to the bottom of the cliff and jumped down. He landed directly before the fierce beast Luo Tian had seen.

“You can transform!” Seeing the senior, the white fierce beast stood up immediately and gazed at him.

If Luo Tian saw this senior, he would recognize that the senior was none other than the Dragon Whale who had climbed onto the Seven Star Island with him.

“Ha! You beg me, beg me, and I’ll tell you!” The Dragon Whale’s face showed a triumphant expression as he spoke to the snow-white beast.

“Hurry up and tell me, I don’t have time to waste with you!” The snow-white beast spoke coldly, and a chill wind swept over the Dragon Whale.
