Luo Tian, who had remained silent throughout, felt the fluctuation approaching and finally opened his eyes. A cold glint flashed in his gaze as he declared, "If you wish to play, I shall join you!"

Ignoring the formidable fluctuations radiating from Zhu Que, Luo Tian extended his hand and struck the Zhen Hun Ding. The lid of the cauldron lifted, producing a deep resonance that reverberated in people's hearts.

At the moment the lid of the Zhen Hun Ding was lifted, golden light radiated outward. Many with low cultivation could not control themselves and closed their eyes tightly.

"Wū…" A mournful sound echoed, as if a golden sun rose from the Zhen Hun Ding and soared into the sky.

"Du Tian Yang Shen Dan!" Jiang Sixi's face changed abruptly as the elixir ascended, her eyes filled with excitement.

"Unexpectedly, he succeeded!" Jiang Sixi murmured to herself, recalling the argument she had with Luo Tian over alchemy.

Jiang Sixi was fond of studying elixir formulas and creating new ones. The Du Tian Yang Shen Dan had been a formula they co-created, but it was incomplete. Jiang Sixi never expected Luo Tian to complete the elixir alone.

The sun rose, instantly reaching Zhu Que's body and emitting a continuous hum.

"Come here!" Luo Tian roared, channeling his three original essences into the Du Tian Yang Shen Dan without reserve.

"Zhōng…" Upon receiving the three original essences, the sun in the sky became even more radiant. The intense light stung people's eyes; even Sima Qiong and others had to activate their cultivation to withstand the pain.

On the other side, the tangible Zhu Que let out a mournful cry and vanished instantly, its form dissolving as it absorbed the vitality of herbs. Under the overwhelming light, it seemed purified.

"Zhōng…" Moreover, the red elixir trembled gently under the powerful light. The already formed elixir began to disintegrate gradually.

"No!" Ke Xindie felt the vitality of her elixir weakening, her face contorted with madness but helplessness. Her eyes flashed with hatred as she gazed at Luo Tian.

Ke Xindie had never imagined Luo Tian's alchemical mastery was so profound. Without Jiang Sixi, she believed she would dominate the competition.

Indeed, things had proceeded as Ke Xindie planned—until Luo Tian appeared at the last moment. A man she had never regarded as a threat.

"Light attribute original essence!" The four masters were stunned, their faces etched with surprise as they gazed at the Du Tian Yang Shen Dan.

What eyes did they have? They sensed the elixir's difference from others, their expressions filled with shock.

"Peng…" A faint sound echoed; Ke Xindie's elixir vanished after enduring for a few breaths, leaving only the radiant Du Tian Yang Shen Dan in the sky.

"Kāchā…" At the same time, chaotic thunder descended instantly toward the Du Tian Yang Shen Dan.

Yet, the formidable thunderstorm—known as an elixir's bane—never reached the elixir's body. It was dissolved by the intense purification power.

"Elisir complete!" Luo Tian kicked off the ground, ascending into the air and standing before the sun-like Du Tian Yang Shen Dan. He appeared as if a deity had descended, exuding immense might.

As the chaotic thunderstorm faded, the Du Tian Yang Shen Dan's radiance gradually dimmed, eventually condensing into a luminous pearl that Luo Tian swiftly collected in a jade vial.

People stared at Luo Tian in shock, their minds recalling the outcome of this alchemical contest. Their lips twitched involuntarily.

Indeed, as Ke Xindie had thought, only one person emerged victorious in this alchemical contest—but it was not her. It was Luo Tian.

"Palm clapping…" Applause erupted, the disciples of Qinglong Sect wearing expressions of excitement as they clapped their hands.

As if in unison, people extended their arms and collided them repeatedly. Whether to honor the contest's brilliance or Luo Tian's Du Tian Yang Shen Dan, they knew one truth: from now on, Luo Tian's name as an alchemist would be renowned across the Four Sacred Stars.

"Destroy my elixir—kill you!" A cold voice echoed as a fiery red figure transformed into a streak of light, instantly appearing before Luo Tian.

Chapter 767: Manifestation

Chapter 767: Manifestation

On the Feng Shen platform, Luo Tian stood in the sky, a faint smile on his face as he descended toward the platform. Clearly, this alchemical contest had made him the undeniable first place.

"Destroy my elixir—die!" As Luo Tian was about to descend, a fiery red figure burst through the barrier. A crescent moon saber, accompanied by crimson blade light, cleaved the sky and rushed toward Luo Tian.

At the same time, a hum resonated; devastating red flames formed into a fiery red Zhu Que, emitting a low cry as it approached Luo Tian.

Feeling the immense power of the fluctuation, even a three-source supreme could not withstand such an attack. Luo Tian's face darkened.

"Go away…" His aura surged skyward, and with a step forward, he vanished from the spot to evade the crescent moon saber.

In an instant, Luo Tian reappeared in the sky. He waved his hand, and a vast emerald ocean surged upward. The碧晶琉璃火 (Bìjīng Liúlí Huǒ) transformed into a green dragon, rushing toward the fiery red Zhu Que and entwining with its ancestral fire.

From Ke Xindie's attack to Luo Tian's counterattack, their clash lasted only an instant. People saw a flash of red and a green dragon colliding with the red Zhu Que, their collision generating terrifying temperatures that instantly burned through the barrier set by the four seven-source supreme masters.

"What's going on? Why are they fighting?" People looked at the sky with confusion, watching Luo Tian and Ke Xindie rushing in different directions.

"Kid, destroying my elixir—what are you?!" Ke Xindie's face was twisted with rage. The crescent moon saber returned to her hand, and she rushed toward Luo Tian again.

"Why? Are you so angry that you want to kill me for destroying your elixir? If that's the case, you must have died countless times already!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He despised Ke Xindie's impolite behavior and brandished his spear, showing no fear. His figure darted forward, instantly appearing before Ke Xindie and unleashing four spear techniques.

"Reckless! This is the ranking battle—how dare you fight privately? Who gave you the courage?" Ke Zhen Tian struck his chair, his face filled with fury. He extended his hand, and a massive aura surged toward the two, causing Luo Tian and Ke Xindie to freeze in place.

A fiery red hand instantly appeared before Luo Tian and Ke Xindie, pressing down upon them.

Chen Xuanning's face showed a hint of pity but he shook his head, knowing his intimidation was not yet enough to threaten the three.

Jin Yongsi's face gleamed with excitement as he watched the energy hand press toward them. He gave a barely perceptible nod to Ke Zhen Tian.

Sha Cangmang's face flashed with coldness, his gaze deep as he looked at Ke Zhen Tian. "Return!"

His words carried authority. As Sha Cangmang's voice echoed, Ke Zhen Tian's energy hand shattered violently. Luo Tian's figure was instantly pulled toward Sha Cangmang.

Sha Cangmang coldly gazed at Ke Zhen Tian. Though others couldn't tell, Sha Cangmang and the other three knew that although the hand seemed to target both Luo Tian and Ke Xindie, nine out of ten power was concentrated on Luo Tian. If both were struck, who would die was obvious.

"Ke Zhen Tian, don't push too far. If you wish to fight, I'll accompany you!" Sha Cangmang coldly spoke, his gaze sweeping over Ke Zhen Tian and Jin Yongsi.

"Sanctum ranking battle forbids private combat, this has been the rule for years. Does Sha Xiong intend to break it because of a disciple?" Jin Yongsi added oil to the fire, his gaze toward Sha Cangmang.

"Good!" Sha Cangmang's face was icy, and he extended his hand to snatch Ke Xindie before him. His aged palm lifted her effortlessly.

"If I first kill this girl, then strike down Luo Tian—would that be acceptable?" Sha Cangmang's cold gaze met Ke Zhen Tian, his voice laced with killing intent.

Ke Xindie had never feared anything before, but now that Sha Cangmang held her, fear flickered on her face.

Ke Zhen Tian's expression shifted. Ke Xindie was his most talented descendant, inheriting the Zhu Que ancestral fire. How could he risk her life to exchange for Luo Tian's?

Seeing Sha Cangmang's eyes filled with killing intent, if he nodded, Sha Cangmang would definitely annihilate Ke Xindie. Sha Cangmang spoke softly, "Sha Xiong, don't be impulsive. Let this matter end here!"

"End it? Senior, how can this matter be ended? It was your outstanding descendant who provoked me. She caused all alchemists to explode their furnaces, and then she dared to destroy my elixir. Why should I not seek retribution? If this matter isn't resolved, do you think Qinglong Sect is easy to bully?" Luo Tian's voice echoed as Ke Zhen Tian spoke, causing the alchemists who had participated in the contest to be stunned.

"Yes! It was Ke Xindie's fault, and she still wants to kill me. Luo Tian, the alchemist, was merely defending himself! Why isn't Ke Xindie punished?" Someone led the chant, their gaze filled with indignation toward Ke Zhen Tian.

With one leading, others followed. The alchemists were all in a bad mood after their elixirs had been destroyed, and Luo Tian had avenged them. Yet he was nearly killed, leaving the alchemists deeply unsettled.

Alchemists were proud; they could lose in the art of alchemy, but not in dignity. If you lost, you must accept it gracefully. But to destroy another's elixir and then kill them for revenge—what was this contest?

Like lighting a fuse, all the alchemists roared, their gazes filled with discontent toward Ke Zhen Tian.

"The anger of alchemists!" Everyone's gaze turned to the gathering alchemists, their lips twitching.

Ke Zhen Tian's face darkened slightly. He had been pleased with Ke Xindie's performance, but the result was unexpected.

If alchemists united, even Ke Zhen Tian felt uneasy. He sighed, "Xindie, apologize to Luo Senior Brother!"

Seeing Ke Zhen Tian yield, Sha Cangmang's expression softened and he returned Ke Xindie to his side.

Ke Xindie's face was flushed, whether from Sha Cangmang's grip or anger. A red handprint marked her neck clearly.

Her eyes locked onto Luo Tian, her expression dark with hatred. She dared not defy Ke Zhen Tian's order.

"Sorry, Luo Senior Brother!" Ke Xindie lowered her head slightly, but her voice still carried arrogance. A powerful killing intent stirred within her.

"It's fine, it's fine!" Luo Tian lightly patted Ke Xindie's head and helped her up.

Seeing Luo Tian's action, Qinglong Sect disciples' lips curled slightly. Jiang Sixi's face turned grim, recalling the time she had been Luo Tian's servant for two days.

"During the strength contest, I'll kill you!" Ke Xindie clenched her fists tightly, her low voice echoing in Luo Tian's mind.

"Who do you think you are to want my life?" Luo Tian laughed lightly, his voice imprinted in Ke Xindie's mind. No one saw the hidden coldness in Luo Tian's eyes.

"Alright, since you've made peace, let's keep it harmonious. Young people shouldn't be so impulsive!" Elder Chen Xuanning, the good-natured one, tried to ease the atmosphere with a warm smile toward Luo Tian and Ke Xindie.

After this turmoil, Luo Tian and Ke Xindie returned to their respective sects—Qinglong Sect and Zhuque Sect.

Seeing Luo Tian return, Qinglong Sect disciples wore expressions of respect. Luo Tian had secured twenty points for Qinglong Sect, while other sects scored nothing. At this point, Qinglong Sect had twenty-six points, eight more than the second-place Xuanwu Sect.

In the ranking battle, every point was crucial. Though the final combat scores were numerous, they would be fiercely contested. Thus, these ten points were extremely important.

"Dead! Dead! I want him dead!" Ke Xindie returned to Zhuque Sect's area and gritted her teeth. She grabbed a nearby attendant and repeatedly punched and kicked him, treating the attendant as Luo Tian.

"Alright, let's get revenge for you!" A man with sharp eyebrows approached Ke Xindie and spoke softly.

Ke Xinshui, the first genius of Zhuque Sect, was one of the four small masters alongside Jiang Sixi and Yang Dingtian of Baihu Sect, Chen Lerren of Xuanwu Sect. They were among the contenders for the ranking battle's strength title.

"Back already?" Luo Tian wore a faint smile, gazing at Jiang Sixi with a hint of confusion. He felt an unfamiliar familiarity about her.

As he looked at Jiang Sixi, Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly. The image before him gradually overlapped with a memory.

"Long Haoyue!" Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief, gazing at Jiang Sixi.

"Recognized it?" Jiang Sixi's face carried a playful expression, her clear voice echoing in Luo Tian's ears. The Qinglong Sect disciples nearby were puzzled.

Luo Tian could not speak, his face shocked. He felt Jiang Sixi's cultivation and was stunned.

"Five-source Supreme!" A disciple of Qinglong Sect shouted, gazing at Jiang Sixi with eyes filled with fervor.

"You're too fast!" Luo Tian sighed, inwardly praising Jiang Sixi's talent. He had benefited from Qinglong Sect's resources to reach six-source Tian Supreme, eventually becoming a three-source supreme.

Luo Tian had not expected Jiang Sixi to reach five-source supreme in half a year, just one step away from six-source Tian Supreme.

Seeing Luo Tian's surprise, Jiang Sixi's gaze turned slightly triumphant but soon darkened as she recalled her plan. If it weren't for Luo Tian, her plan would not have been interrupted prematurely.

Indeed, Long Haoyue was Jiang Sixi's manifestation. However, it differed from ordinary manifestations. When Jiang Sixi ascended to the Convergence Soul stage, she had released this manifestation. It was due to her cultivation method.

Chapter 768: The Start of the Strength Battle

Chapter 768: The Start of the Strength Battle

Luo Tian wore an odd expression as he gazed at Jiang Sixi, inwardly puzzled about the relationship between Long Haoyue and Jiang Sixi.

Logically, if Long Haoyue was Jiang Sixi's manifestation, then Jiang Sixi would have recognized Luo Tian upon seeing him. However, when they first met, Jiang Sixi had not recognized Luo Tian. Moreover, if it were a manifestation, their appearances would be identical—this was impossible to explain.

Seeing Luo Tian's confusion, Jiang Sixi gritted her teeth. Long Haoyue was indeed Jiang Sixi's manifestation, tied to her cultivation method.

This method had been her lifelong practice—when she reached the Convergence Soul stage, she released a manifestation. This manifestation grew independently and was almost identical to another person, with its own personality and appearance.

Jiang Sixi had sent this manifestation into Baihu Sect to develop independently, seizing its resources. She planned to wait until both the manifestation and her true self reached Tian Supreme before merging them, thereby enabling herself to enter nine-source supreme.

However, Jiang Sixi had underestimated the power of the Binding Soul. Even after merging both manifestations and one unique soul, she still found no way to break the Binding Soul.

Thinking of having to continue cultivating endlessly to reach nine-source supreme, Jiang Sixi's gaze toward Luo Tian turned unkind.

"Ugh…" Feeling Jiang Sixi's hostile gaze, Luo Tian felt awkward. He didn't know why this woman had suddenly gone mad.

"Alchemical contest begins!" As Luo Tian felt awkward, the voice of the head elder echoed in people's ears, easing his embarrassment. He turned his gaze toward the Feng Shen platform.

The alchemical contest was the simplest of all, ending in half a day with results matching people's expectations. Baihu Sect came first, Zhuque Sect second, Qinglong Sect third, and Xuanwu Sect fourth.

"Ah, it seems this year we'll be at the bottom again!" Chen Xuanning sighed, his face devoid of anger.

Perhaps due to Chen Xuanning's influence, Xuanwu Sect disciples had remarkably good temperaments. They never forced themselves to compete for anything and were usually at the bottom of rankings in every ranking battle.

"Next, the strength contest!" The voice of the head supreme echoed again, causing everyone's eyes to brighten slightly with anticipation.

Alchemy and weapon forging were minor arts; strength was the ultimate truth. People cultivated alchemy and forging to enhance their power ultimately.

Hearing the head's words, Luo Tian, Jiang Sixi, and Sima Qiong exchanged glances before leaping onto the platform and standing in their designated Qinglong Sect position.

Other sect disciples also stood with battle intent on the Feng Shen platform, glaring at their rival sects.

According to past contest rules, the twelve members of the four major sects would directly become the top twelve and compete separately. After all, Jiang Sixi's strength was far superior to that of other sect disciples.

Even Luo Tian saw some sects sending their Convergence Soul peak disciples to fight against supreme masters. That was not seeking death?

In past strength contests, it had been the most thrilling event. The previous contests were merely preparations for this final one.

"Qinglong Sect really has no people; they sent two attendants!" The four sects' disciples were separated into a group. As soon as they landed, voices echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

"Exactly! Two attendants, hahaha!" Before the voice faded, another laughter echoed.

"Yang Yangfei and Ke Xindie?" Luo Tian's gaze turned toward the sound, recognizing the two from the alchemical contest—Yang Yangfei of Baihu Sect and Ke Xindie of Zhuque Sect.

Their faces bore mockery as they gazed at Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi, knowing their strength but still wanting to mock. Especially Ke Xindie, her eyes filled with hatred toward Luo Tian.

"Cut it out! Two attendants—what are you? You two lost to attendants. What are you then? Just talkative brats, two wastes?" Luo Tian lightly wiped his golden headband and gazed at Baihu Sect and Zhuque Sect's two with contempt.

"Really, Baihu Sect and Zhuque Sect don't know what to do with you two wastes. You're here to highlight others' excellence. Two sects are really wrong, having your presence lowers their intelligence. Go home and study better before coming back for the contest!" Before they could respond, Luo Tian's mouth was like a continuous barrage.

How amusing! Luo Tian inwardly mocked: "I've met four talkers, you two are no match for me!" Though he hadn't received the true teachings of Xu Liyi, Zheng Xin, and others, these two spoiled disciples were no match for Luo Tian.

In terms of verbal sparring, Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin, along with Tian Luo and Gu Lei, were comparable to nine-source supreme masters. Being near the red makes one red—these two were not even in the same league as Luo Tian.

Their faces turned red, watching Luo Tian spew words. Their auras surged violently as they brandished their weapons.

"Alright, prepare yourselves; we'll start soon!" Seeing the tension, the head supreme sighed and interrupted Luo Tian.

"The rules are simple: draw lots to determine opponents, twelve to six, then six to three. The remaining three will each have a bye and directly advance to the second place!" The head elder explained the rules.

"Also, during the contest, weapons are blind; cultivation is difficult. If casualties occur, it's your own fault!" The head elder sighed and reminded everyone.

Hearing the head elder's words, Luo Tian's expression shifted slightly. He understood the rules and gazed at Baihu Sect and Zhuque Sect with a smile, inwardly sighing: "I hope you don't push too far. Otherwise, I'll have no choice but to send you to the afterlife!"

Twelve people drew lots, found their opponents, and stepped into the barrier. Coincidentally, Luo Tian's opponent was Yang Yangfei.

On the other side, Sima Qiong faced Zhuque Sect's Ke Xindie. Jiang Sixi encountered a three-source supreme of Xuanwu Sect.

"Such luck, I never expected to meet you. It seems the glory is mine!" Yang Yangfei smiled and waved his hand, two swords—blue and red—fell into his grasp. His aura gradually rose as he gazed at Luo Tian with greed.

Yang Yangfei knew that the sect master had transmitted a message to the three of them: killing Luo Tian would be a great achievement.

"Want to kill me?" Luo Tian smiled and gazed at Yang Yangfei, his voice questioning.

"Didn't want to, just a sparring match! Weapons are blind; death is inevitable!" Yang Yangfei dared not openly say he wanted to kill Luo Tian, as that would immediately result in being killed by the supreme masters.

Though he said this, Yang Yangfei's two swords glowed intensely, his aura rising rapidly and nearing its peak.

"Indeed, weapons are blind!" Luo Tian remained calm, his black crackling spear in hand. He inwardly sneered at Yang Yangfei for being blinded by profit. A four-source supreme didn't fear him, let alone a three-source one.

"Kill!" As Luo Tian sneered, Yang Yangfei's aura reached its peak and his eyes flashed with killing intent. He pushed off the ground, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"You're not ready yet!" Luo Tian coldly sneered and unleashed all his strength without hiding. His voice was like a chill wind, causing Yang Yangfei to pause momentarily.

A mournful sound echoed as the crackling spear sliced through the air, piercing space and凝聚 (concentrating) Luo Tian's three original essences. Its speed was unparalleled, one spear splitting the sky and ruling over the heavens.

"Pu…" A streak of light flashed, and in an instant, Luo Tian's figure appeared before the crowd. The spear tip was dripping with blood.

Yang Yangfei stood frozen in terror, motionless, his eyes vacant. Even the two swords on him had streaks of light.

"Luo Tian wins!" The head supreme's face bore a hint of amazement, gazing at Luo Tian and inwardly marveling at his speed.

Too fast! Luo Tian's spear was beyond the reach of a ground-level supreme. Yang Yangfei hadn't even reacted before being pierced through, his soul annihilated by the immense tearing force.

"A dead man!" The onlookers' faces bore disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian. They hadn't expected the first battle to end so quickly.

"Too terrifying!" People exclaimed in fear, not expecting that the four sects' contest had already resulted in a death.

"Sha Cangmang, this kid killed our Baihu Sect's disciple. What do you say?" Jin Yongsi's face bore a look of sorrow. Though Yang Yangfei ranked third in Baihu Sect, his alchemical skills were quite good.

"Weapons are blind!" Sha Cangmang's face bore a complex expression, gazing at Luo Tian. A strange feeling arose in his heart—Luo Tian was too satisfying, but the plan was too important. It was Qinglong Sect's foundation for dominating the Four Sacred Stars.

"A good 'weapons are blind'! Very good, very good. Pray that this kid doesn't meet Yang Yangfei's brother Yang Dingtian. That kid would tear Luo Tian apart!" Jin Yongsi spoke, his gaze toward Luo Tian now fierce.

Having already killed over a dozen Baihu Sect disciples on Black Rock Continent, including seven-source supreme Hu Tianyun who died because of Luo Tian, Jin Yongsi no longer had any intention of recruiting Luo Tian. He only wished to kill this annoying kid and vent his anger.

Chapter 769: The Cycle of the Sword Technique

Chapter 769: The Cycle of the Sword Technique

"Instant kill!" People outside the Feng Shen platform bore expressions of disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian. Though they knew he was strong, they hadn't expected him to be this powerful—killing a three-source supreme with one strike.

Luo Tian walked calmly to the side, ignoring the crowd's shock and gazing at other battlefields. His mind remained calm as a man with dual swords caught his attention.

Yang Dingtian, Yang Yangfei's brother, bore a furious expression. Seeing Luo Tian gazing at him, his eyes were filled with killing intent as he swung his dual swords and ruthlessly slashed the Xuanwu Sect disciple he was fighting.

"Crack…" The Xuanwu Sect disciple, known for his defense, had his domain instantly shattered. Two sword qi slashed across the disciple's body, leaving deep wounds.

Yang Dingtian had no intention of letting the Xuanwu Sect disciple surrender. He pushed off the ground, and his two swords transformed into meteors, rushing toward the Xuanwu Sect disciple.

"Surrender!" The Xuanwu Sect disciple knew he was no match for Yang Dingtian and shouted.

"Kill…" Yang Dingtian, however, seemed deaf to the plea and continued his attack.

"Hmph!" A cold sound echoed as the head supreme appeared before Yang Dingtian, his sleeve sweeping and releasing a violent aura.

Yang Dingtian's strength was formidable—having mastered four original essences, but he was no match for a six-source Tian Supreme. His body instantly recoiled and collided with the barrier, spitting blood.

"You think I'm a decoration? If he has already surrendered and still has killing intent, he will be annihilated on the spot!" The head supreme's face bore coldness as he gazed at Yang Dingtian with hostility.

The Xuanwu Sect disciples looked at Baihu Sect's disciple with discontent and even a faint hostility. Many other sect disciples also bore anger. Xuanwu Sect's nature was good, but it didn't mean they would let others kill them without resistance.

Xuanwu Sect had a good reputation and was well-liked, never engaging in conflicts. This time, Yang Dingtian's attempt to kill an Xuanwu Sect disciple had even caused Jin Yongsi some dissatisfaction.

"Apologies, junior brother! I'm sorry for my elder's misconduct!" Yang Dingtian, no doubt a contemporary genius, quickly regained his composure and wore an expression of regret as he gazed at the head elder and the Xuanwu Sect disciple.

"It's fine, Yang Senior Brother. Let bygones be bygones!" The Xuanwu Sect disciple recovered from his wound and smiled憨厚 (honest).

"Apologies for the trouble, Elder Chen. My disciples were disrespectful; don't take it to heart!" Jin Yongsi's face bore apology as he gazed at Chen Xuanning.

"Hmph, your disciples are the same as you—upside down and downside up!" Sha Cangmang sneered.

"Sha Cangmang, don't be shameless! Your disciple killed a Baihu Sect person. Now you're talking—what's your intention?" Jin Yongsi's face darkened and shouted at Sha Cangmang.

"Enough, don't argue! We've known each other for years; can't you get along? Your tempers are still so high!" Chen Xuanning played the mediator, addressing both.

Chen Xuanning's words made Sha Cangmang feel some guilt and he stopped speaking. Jin Yongsi also felt sorry for Chen Xuanning and sat on the chair, ignoring Sha Cangmang.

Ko Zhen Tian wore a smile throughout but said nothing, his thoughts unknown to anyone.

For years, the three sects had been in conflict but never involved Xuanwu Sect. After all, Xuanwu Sect was non-aggressive and had the Xuanwu Divine Beast guarding it. Though its time was nearing, no one dared to provoke it. Even if Xuanwu's time was near, it still had the strength of nine-source supreme masters. Thus, the three sects maintained a friendly and supportive attitude toward Xuanwu Sect.

During Sha Cangmang and Jin Yongsi's quarrel, two more matches concluded on the platform. Jiang Sixi quickly defeated her opponent and stood before Luo Tian.

Ko Xinsui wore a smile as she appeared at Zhuque Sect's disciples' gathering.

As the two descended, Chen Lerren of Xuanwu Sect also appeared with a憨厚 (honest) expression at his sect's gathering. Due to the draw, Xuanwu Sect had an internal battle. If it weren't for Chen Lerren's desire to guide the disciple, his match might have ended faster than Luo Tian's.

The twelve-to-six match of the four sects had only Ko Xindie and Sima Qiong's battle remaining.

The thunderous sound echoed within their barrier, as if encountering a formidable opponent. Two figures continuously clashed and collided.

Luo Tian gazed at Sima Qiong's weapon, a dice, and couldn't help but smile. He inwardly marveled at how Sima Qiong had embedded his gambling hobby into his bones.

"Zhu Que Ancestral Fire!" Ko Xindie's face bore coldness. Due to Luo Tian, she had no goodwill toward Qinglong Sect and thus attacked Sima Qiong fiercely.

A terrifying temperature rose, causing the entire barrier to tremble slightly. The red Zhu Que seemed reborn in fire and let out a low cry, rushing toward Sima Qiong.

"I'll gamble with you!" Feeling the terrifying temperature of the Zhu Que, Sima Qiong's face bore a fierce expression. Compared to strength, he was nearly equal to Ko Xindie. However, the Zhu Que Ancestral Fire made him suffer greatly.

A massive dice spun above Sima Qiong, emitting a piercing hum that grew faster and faster. It stirred up a storm, and Sima Qiong's four-color original essences surged into the storm, enhancing its power.

The terrifying storm clashed violently with the Zhu Que Ancestral Fire, forming a fierce fire whirlwind that raged through space.

"Deflected!" Sima Qiong's face bore joy, but in an instant, a red crescent moon broke through the storm and transformed into a streak of red light, instantly appearing before Sima Qiong and rushing toward his throat.

A life-or-death crisis surged in Sima Qiong's heart. He gritted his teeth, knowing he couldn't escape the crescent moon saber and forced his body to twist.

"Pu…" Blood splattered, Sima Qiong's face was drenched in sweat. His entire arm was severed by the crescent moon saber.

At the same time, the fire storm dissipated completely. Sima Qiong's dice weapon also slowly fell from the sky, swaying slightly before finally landing on two points.

"Two, low—surrender!" Sima Qiong spoke like a gambler who had lost everything, addressing the head supreme. He retrieved his severed arm and placed it on his bleeding shoulder, healing rapidly but with a pale face. This arm would be unusable for several days.

"Good that you surrendered quickly!" Ko Xindie sneered, gazing at Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi before slowly walking to Ko Xinsui's side.

Sima Qiong returned to Qinglong Sect disciples' gathering with a bitter smile: "The rest is up to you."

"Relax, if I meet that woman, I'll sever her arms to avenge you!" Luo Tian smiled and placed a nine-source elixir in Sima Qiong's hand.

Jiang Sixi, seeing Sima Qiong's wound, also flashed coldness and gazed at Ko Xindie with hostility.

"Next round: six to three, draw lots!" The head supreme, seeing no deaths, nodded in satisfaction and scanned the six people.

The six stepped forward to draw lots. A sharp gaze fell on Luo Tian, making him instinctively touch his nose.

"This kid has a built-in grudge," Sima Qiong stood at the Feng Shen platform, gazing at Ko Xindie, Yang Dingtian, and Ko Xinsui. His face bore a bitter smile.

"Kid, don't let me draw you. If I do, you're dead!"

"Killing my brother—make you suffer!" Two voices echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his eyes flash with sharpness.

"Who kills whom—uncertain!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with killing intent, gazing at the three with provocation. He grabbed his number.

"Haha!" Yang Dingtian's face bore a wild smile, gazing at Luo Tian. He extended his hands and retrieved two swords—Yang Yangfei's swords.

"Dead, I was drawn by Yang Dingtian. Seems I have no chance to avenge!" Ko Xindie's face bore disappointment.

"Haha, it's better to save energy!" Ko Xinsui smiled lightly. Deep down, he didn't want Ko Xindie to face Luo Tian. He could sense the ruthless aura from Luo Tian. If Ko Xindie met Luo Tian, she would definitely attack him with all her might. However, Ko Xinsui knew Ko Xindie was no match for Luo Tian.

But in an instant, Ko Xinsui froze, realizing his opponent was Chen Lerren and suddenly recalling something. He gazed toward Ko Xindie's direction.
