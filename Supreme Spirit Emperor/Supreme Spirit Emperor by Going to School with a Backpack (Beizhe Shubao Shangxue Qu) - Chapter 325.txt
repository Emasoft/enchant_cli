Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang saw the gazes of their Star Moon Divine Clan kin, their faces betraying a faint smile of bitterness. They knew the people must have assumed one of them had obtained the Divine Emperor's Mandate.

"Where has the Third Prince gone? Could it be..." However, people soon noticed something amiss. When Fu Xingyue and his entourage had entered, there were many of them, but now only three remained. As for Fu Tianqing carrying a charcoal-like figure, no one regarded him as human.

"Something's wrong. Why do I sense no aura of authority from either of the two princes? Could it be they didn't assimilate the Divine Emperor's Mandate?" Their gazes carried disbelief as they stared at Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang exchanged a glance, then stepped aside to reveal Fu Xingxuan, their expressions carrying reverence.

"嗡……" Fu Xingxuan felt a flicker of nervousness, but having endured the Thunder Palace's trials, he had weathered greater storms. Facing the crowd's scrutiny was nothing new to him.

A wave of bloodline authority radiated from Fu Xingxuan, instantly causing the gathered crowd to erupt in murmurs of disbelief, their eyes wide as they stared at Fu Xingxuan.

"Is... is it Star Moon Princess? Has she assimilated the Divine Emperor's Mandate?"

"That means the next Divine Emperor will be Star Moon Princess?" The crowd murmured, their gazes filled with confusion.

"Logically speaking, it is Fu Xingxuan who shall be the next Divine Emperor," Fu Tianqing smiled, addressing the crowd with a glance toward Fu Xingxuan.

"Truly?" Upon hearing Fu Tianqing's words, the people turned chaotic. None had expected the Divine Emperor to be a woman.

"Who among you disagrees? Speak up!" Fu Xingyang's gaze darkened, reverting to the depth of the elder prince.

"Indeed! Who disagrees? I'll settle it with you!" Fu Xingyue stepped forward at the opportune moment, radiating authority as his gaze swept over the crowd.

"No one dares!" The people quickly bowed in reverence. Though Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang had seemingly failed to seize the throne, if they protected Fu Xingxuan, her position would be unshakable.

Fu Xingyang's wisdom was unparalleled; Fu Xingyue possessed extraordinary talent. One scholarly, one martial—supporting Fu Xingxuan, the Star Moon Divine Clan had no rival.

"Let's go," Fu Tianqing smiled. Who became the Divine Emperor mattered little to him. In fact, he was reluctant for Fu Xingxuan to bear the burden of the throne; being a Divine Emperor was arduous and prone to distraction.

"Long live Star Moon Princess! What's wrong with a woman? I'll support her too!" A voice rang out from the crowd, eyes burning as they gazed at Fu Xingxuan—undoubtedly one of her former admirers.

"I support her too!" Others soon caught on, their faces alight with excitement as they looked at Fu Xingxuan. Fu Xingxuan had always held high esteem in Star Moon City, and now as the next Divine Emperor—though not yet enthroned—it was already a foregone conclusion.

The crowd erupted in fervor, shouting their resolve as if fearing Fu Xingxuan might miss their declarations.

"Alas..." Fu Xingxuan sighed deeply within, her violet eyes glinting with a faint smile as she surveyed the crowd.

"Everyone, return home for now. All remains uncertain," Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, her smile rendering the sky itself dim, causing all gazes to momentarily freeze in admiration.

Fu Tianqing led the charcoal-like Lu Tian toward the Alchemy Hall, while Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang escorted Fu Xingxuan through the crowd, clearly positioning themselves as her protectors.

Seeing Fu Xingxuan depart, the people scattered in a frenzy. Soon, Star Moon City echoed with news of Fu Xingxuan obtaining the Divine Emperor's Mandate and becoming the next Divine Emperor.

Among Star Moon City's populace, some supported her, others opposed. They deemed it improper for a woman to hold such an esteemed position. Though Fu Xingxuan had long enjoyed high popularity, it was largely due to her beauty and talent. Though formidable, she still lagged behind many prodigies.

Days passed swiftly. Seven days later, three figures emerged from the depths of the ancient Star Moon Divine Clan. Three elders radiated power, their auras restrained yet exuding an invisible威慑.

"Fu Xingxuan shall be the next Divine Emperor!" The three elders spoke first, their voices laced with authority.

At the sound of their words, Star Moon City fell silent. No one dared challenge Fu Xingxuan's status.

For these three were none other than the Star Moon City's three Guardians—monuments of stability across the Star Moon Continent, formidable beings at the peak of the Epoch.

"冥族 (Ming Clan), the Epoch-End strength Ming Xi Hong, murdered our Third Prince and ten Epoch-Start warriors, along with several half-Epoch clan members. This blood debt must be repaid in kind! One month hence, on the day of the new Emperor's enthronement, we shall strike at the Ming Clan! Blood must be repaid with blood!" A domineering, authoritative voice rang out as Fu Tianba stood behind the three Guardians, declaring.

"What? The Ming Clan... they killed the Third Prince!"

"Even those warriors accompanying the three princes were slain by the Ming Clan!" Star Moon City erupted in chaos, then a wave of indomitable killing intent surged from its people.

"Avenging the Third Prince and our kin!"

"Massacre those Ming Clan scum! Daring to attack our Star Moon Divine Clan, we fear them not!" Shouts erupted across Star Moon City, spreading to the entire Star Moon Continent.

"New Emperor's enthronement—using the Ming Clan as a震慑?" People seemed to already envision two ancient royal clans clashing, corpses littering the battlefield.

"Hmph..." A cold scoff echoed through Star Moon City's skies. The three Epoch-End masters dispersed in different directions, vanishing from sight.

"We'll clear out the filth across the Star Moon Continent first!" The three Guardians disappeared from view.

Star Moon City soon stirred with chaos. Though the city inevitably harbored Ming Clan members, they were now all exposed and slain by Star Moon Divine Clan forces—relentless, with a "better to kill wrongly than let one escape" mentality.

While Star Moon Divine Clan members fervently cleansed Ming Clan adherents, Lu Tian gradually recovered. His condition improved daily.

These days, Lu Tian no longer resembled charcoal; his body seemed to regrow flesh and blood, his breaths steady.

"Stupid boy!" Fu Tianqing observed Lu Tian, a smile playing on his lips. He was thoroughly satisfied with him now.

"Even I was deceived! Truly remarkable!" Fu Tianqing spoke softly, his tone devoid of reproach, instead filled with admiration.

Time passed slowly. Half a month later, under Fu Tianqing's meticulous care, Lu Tian fully recovered and appeared before him.

"Boom... Boom..." A thunderous resonance echoed within Lu Tian's body. He slowly opened his eyes, surveyed himself internally, and a faint smile graced his face.

"Two Immortal Bodies of Rebirth—fully consolidated!" Lu Tian knew that after great peril came great opportunity. Though he had nearly perished, he was aware the Epoch Book had saved him.

"Kid, your constitution is unparalleled. You recovered so swiftly!" Fu Tianqing smiled, approaching Lu Tian.

"Thank you, Master for saving me!" Lu Tian immediately knelt to the ground, his first prostration before Fu Tianqing. Though he had seemed unconscious these days, he knew the old man had used his cultivation to aid him. Without Fu Tianqing, he wouldn't have recovered so quickly.

"Good, all is well. Your life truly is tenacious. I thought you were dead for sure!" Fu Tianqing smiled, watching Lu Tian. He knew Lu Tian had secrets, but now he only saw him as his disciple—despite Lu Tian's alchemy mastery surpassing his own.

"Master, this is the alchemy inheritance I once obtained. I hope you'll accept it!" Lu Tian spoke softly, retrieving a jade slip and imprinting all his years of alchemy insights, formulas, elixirs, and techniques onto it before handing it to Fu Tianqing.

Fu Tianqing gazed at Lu Tian in mild exasperation. He was the master, yet now it was Lu Tian offering an alchemy inheritance—this made Fu Tianqing feel somewhat embarrassed.

Yet he didn't refuse, taking the jade slip. His face soon bore shock; the contents within had stunned him, as if opening a new gateway.

"Take this 'Wanwu Huasheng诀 (Ten Thousand Life Transformation Scripture)' and cultivate it. If successful, it'll be another method for you—though inferior to the Rebirth Heaven's Art!" Fu Tianqing felt a twinge of guilt, waving his hand to gift Lu Tian another jade slip—the very one he'd used to heal Lu Tian.

Lu Tian accepted it without hesitation, and as he stored the jade slip away, a familiar yet complex voice echoed in both his and Fu Tianqing's ears.

"Meichen... you've awakened?" A strikingly handsome figure stepped in from the doorway—none other than Fu Xingyue.

Chapter 1328: Departure on the Day of Enthronement

"Recovered?" Fu Xingyue smiled, bowing to Fu Tianqing before gazing at Lu Tian.

"Yes, I've recovered," Lu Tian sighed deeply. Fu Xingyue hadn't exposed him, meaning she still didn't wish for his death.

"Return to the Star Moon Guard. Don't disturb Grandpa," Fu Xingyue spoke, leaving Lu Tian to wonder what she was thinking.

"Alright," Lu Tian nodded. He knew some matters were better discussed in front of Fu Tianqing.

After parting with Fu Tianqing, they quickly returned to the Star Moon Pavilion. A wistful expression crossed Lu Tian's face.

"Unconsciously, I've stayed here so long!" Lu Tian sighed internally as he and Fu Xingyue walked through the Star Moon Pavilion, feeling the reverent gazes of the Star Moon Guard around them.

Though news of Fu Xingxuan's enthronement had spread widely, some still knew about Lu Tian's deeds in the Thunder Palace. Alone against an Epoch-End strength, if not for his delay, Fu Xingxuan might have lacked time to assimilate the Divine Emperor's Mandate. The consequences would've been catastrophic.

"Grand Commander..." A wave of fervent gazes turned toward Lu Tian, their voices filled with reverence.

They'd also heard a rumor—that Fu Xingxuan and the Star Moon Guard's Grand Commander had something going on. If true, what status would Lu Tian hold in the future?

Silent, both Lu Tian and Fu Xingyue walked into the hall. Upon entering, Fu Xingyue activated the hall's restrictions and turned to face Lu Tian.

"Now that no one else is here, Lu Tian... let me see your true form," Fu Xingyue spoke softly, her gaze deep.

Lu Tian chuckled, lifting his hand to remove the Thousand-Change Mask. His eyes carried a smile.

"It really is you!" Fu Xingyue, seeing Lu Tian's face, finally accepted the truth. She'd still harbored a sliver of hope that he wasn't Fu Meichen.

"Damn it, Lu Tian! You've got guts coming to our Star Moon Divine Clan!" Fu Xingyue's face bore fury, scolding Lu Tian.

"Second Prince, no need to beat around the bush. Just say what you mean!" Lu Tian spoke softly, unwilling to waste words on Fu Xingyue.

"Alas... I yield. I've never yielded to anyone in my life. Truly, I'm impressed by your courage!" Fu Xingyue spoke sincerely after hearing Lu Tian's words.

"I want you to join the Star Moon Guard, forever Fu Meichen!" Fu Xingyue said, then straightened her face, speaking clearly to Lu Tian, eyes locked onto his.

"Forever Fu Meichen? Whose idea was that?" Lu Tian murmured, then shook his head. He naturally understood Fu Xingyue's intent.

As long as he didn't reveal his human race identity, he could remain in the Star Moon Divine Clan at a high position. But could Lu Tian do that? Naturally not. He couldn't abandon everything of the human race. If the Star Moon Divine Clan truly opened the entrance to the Nine Realms and attacked humans, how could he help them against his own kin?

"I knew you wouldn't agree! But I can tell you, if you stay as Fu Meichen, the next Divine Emperor position might be yours!" Fu Xingyue continued, trying to convince Lu Tian to stay.

"If I remain, you'll look down on me!" Lu Tian shook his head again. A Star Moon Divine Emperor? He truly didn't care, even if it was a royal emperor.

"Then when do you plan to leave?" Fu Xingyue nodded slightly. As Lu Tian said, if he stayed, Fu Xingyue would indeed look down on him. Such a Lu Tian wouldn't be worthy of being a prodigy. Essentially, they were the same kind of people; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so close to Lu Tian.

"Within these two days," Lu Tian sighed, his voice laced with excitement. He felt the black and white energies in his dantian; it was indeed time to leave the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"How long have you been here in the Star Moon Divine Clan?" Fu Xingyue waved her hand, and a table of wine and dishes appeared before them. She sat down, poured a cup for Lu Tian, then one for herself, raising it.

Lu Tian lightly picked up the cup, clinked it with Fu Xingyue's, and they both drank deeply. They exchanged glances, laughing.

"Nearly two years," Lu Tian spoke softly, raising the cup again and drinking deeply.

"Two years. Time flies quickly," Fu Xingyue spoke softly, recalling their meeting on the蛮族大陆 (Feral Clan Continent).

"Stay a little longer. See Fu Xingxuan's enthronement before leaving. As an older brother, I know my sister. Though Fu Xingxuan seemed to constantly trouble you, I think she might have developed feelings for you. I'm sure she hopes you'll witness her enthronement," Fu Xingyue spoke softly, trying to persuade Lu Tian.

"Okay," Lu Tian nodded. He knew why Fu Xingyue wanted him to stay—perhaps there would be some chaos during Fu Xingxuan's enthronement, and he'd need to handle it.

After all, the Star Moon Divine Clan's Epoch-Start strength had dwindled. And he was the Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guard, responsible for Star Moon City's safety.

"Come on. No matter what happens in the future, even on the battlefield, I hope you won't hold back. On our path to enlightenment, I won't let you surpass me!" Fu Xingyue laughed loudly, clinking cups with Lu Tian repeatedly. They drank without restraint. Though they were both strong, they didn't fall drunk immediately.

They spent the night recalling their experiences, sighing deeply. Finally, they fell asleep on the ground, unaware that a human prodigy had sat with a royal clan's prodigy, drinking and becoming brothers.

Lu Tian and Fu Xingyue slept until noon the next day. Deputy Commander Fu Zhiming carefully knocked on their door, waking them.

"What's going on?" Fu Xingyue sat there. Lu Tian had restored his Fu Meichen form, standing behind Fu Xingyue with a respectful gaze.

Since the Star Moon Guard managed affairs, Fu Zhiming hadn't entered the Thunder Palace and thus avoided a disaster.

"Second Prince, the Fuyu Clan's prodigy, Fan Jingyu, has arrived at our Star Moon City. He claims to congratulate the new Emperor. The First Prince asked you to greet him," Fu Zhiming bowed, speaking.

"Eldest Brother?" Fu Xingyue's brow furrowed. Since emerging from the Thunder Palace, relations between Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue had improved.

"Eldest Brother? He himself didn't go to greet, did he? He should know I hate such scenes!" Fu Xingyue's face bore impatience, addressing Fu Zhiming.

"The First Prince arrived early this morning and received the Fuyu Clan's Blood King, Tu Feiyang, and the Feral Clan's prodigy, Man Hun. They're currently accompanying him," Fu Zhiming bowed.

"Ugh..." Fu Xingyue awkwardly rubbed his nose, feeling a bit embarrassed. He coughed lightly.

"Let's go. Meichen, come with me to see an old friend," Fu Xingyue smiled, addressing Lu Tian.

"Royal Clan prodigies have arrived?" Lu Tian's brow furrowed. He truly didn't want to meet these royal clan prodigies, but he couldn't avoid it. One, he was still the Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guard and couldn't escape; two, he wanted to see who else among the royal clans had come.

Lu Tian and Fu Xingyue exited the hall, heading toward the teleportation array of Star Moon City.

Since news of the new Emperor's enthronement had spread, other royal clans had received it. Though some were unfriendly, they still needed to attend.

"Currently, only a few royal clans remain..." Fu Xingyue spoke as they walked, transmitting to Lu Tian about the current state of the ten thousand clans.

As they arrived at the teleportation array's entrance, Star Moon Guard members around them all showed reverence, bowing to them.

"Buzz..." As they reached the teleportation array, it emitted a deep hum. A group of golden-clad figures appeared in Lu Tian's view.

Five people, each radiating powerful energy. The weakest was two half-Epoch strength individuals—close allies of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Star Moon Divine Clan Fu Xingyue, respectfully welcomes Fuyu Clan elders!" Fu Xingyue bowed slightly to the two elders at the front of the five, one with white hair and five pairs of wings glowing radiantly, exuding a holy aura. The other had four pairs of wings, also radiant and holy, indicating their strength—Epoch-End and Epoch-Middle.

Behind them stood Fan Jingyu, a familiar face to Lu Tian. Behind him were two half-Epoch strength attendants.

"Ha ha, no need for such formalities. We didn't arrive late, did we?" The elder at the front, clearly recognizing Fu Xingyue, spoke warmly.

"No, there's still ten days until my sister's enthronement," Fu Xingyue respectfully replied, leading the five down from the teleportation array.

"Fu Xingyue, I didn't expect you to lose to your sister. I thought the new Star Moon Divine Emperor would be either you or Fu Xingyang," Fan Jingyu, clearly familiar with Fu Xingyue, spoke playfully.

"I'll lead you to my father. I'll entertain the Fuyu Clan's esteemed guests," Fu Xingyue smiled, ignoring Fan Jingyu's words and leading the Fuyu Clan five.

Chapter 1329: The Qilin Clan

Busy, these days Lu Tian seemed to be constantly busy, his face bearing a stiff smile as he guarded the teleportation array's entrance, watching strange figures emerge from it.

Though no royal clan had arrived, some powerful beings from the ten thousand clans emerged from the teleportation array, keeping Lu Tian busily occupied.

"Quickly! I don't want to live like this anymore!" Lu Tian sighed, sitting on a chair, waiting for the teleportation array to open.

"Buzz..." The humming resonance returned, familiar teleportation energy flickering on the array. Lu Tian's gaze turned to it.

"Deputy Commander, check who it is. You handle it," Lu Tian spoke to Fu Zhiming beside him, his tone lazy.

"Yes..." Fu Zhiming sighed, having heard this countless times. He was also helpless; after all, Lu Tian was stronger than him and his superior.

Fu Zhiming adjusted his attire, smiling as he approached the teleportation array's front.

"Roar..." A deep roar echoed from within the teleportation array, a terrifying aura spreading from it. It felt like a primordial beast awakening, its invisible waves causing Fu Zhiming to retreat two steps.

Sensing the strength of this aura, Lu Tian slowly stood up. He knew it was a sign of great power—such waves usually indicated at least an Epoch-Start strength. He needed to greet them himself.

The aura faded, revealing three figures before Lu Tian's eyes: an elder, a middle-aged man, and a youth. All wore black robes, their bodies surrounded by dark energy, faces cold.

"Ancestral Royal Clan—Qilin Clan!" Lu Tian's mind trembled, recalling Fu Xingyue's information on royal clans.

Lu Tian didn't delay. He quickly sent a message to Fu Xingyue, smiling as he approached the three.

"Respectfully welcoming Qilin Clan's prodigies to our Star Moon Divine Clan!" Lu Tian addressed them.

"Hmph! Who are you?" The black-robed youth, seeing Lu Tian, sneered, his gaze filled with annoyance.

"I am Fu Meichen, Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guard in Star Moon City," Lu Tian replied. Seeing the youth's annoyance, he felt a flicker of discomfort.

The Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guard held a decent rank within the Star Moon Divine Clan, though not as high as Fu Xingyue. Still, greeting them was no disrespect.

"Where are the two princes?" The black-robed youth stepped to the front of the three, scanning Lu Tian.

His eyes then narrowed slightly. A flicker of surprise crossed his gaze—unusual, he couldn't read Lu Tian's cultivation.

"You're not worth it. I'm speaking with him," the black-robed youth waved his sleeve, a swirling mass of dark mist rushing toward Fu Zhiming.

"Boom..." The black storm instantly engulfed Fu Zhiming's body, throwing him back several feet.

A streak of blood trickled from Fu Zhiming's lips. His gaze burned with anger toward the black-robed youth.

"Qilin Clan's Young Master, Qi Ziyang?" Lu Tian slowly raised his head, his gaze deep. He had guessed the youth's identity upon seeing his attack—someone of Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's generation.

The Qilin Clan, though a beast lineage, considered themselves superior to other beasts. Even the Dragon Clan was beneath them. They formed their own lineage, and only the Qilin Clan could transform into human form within the Origin Domain. This made them feel even more superior.

"I don't allow you to raise your head!" Qi Ziyang, seeing Lu Tian's depth, flashed a cold glint. He waved his sleeve again, striking toward Lu Tian.

Throughout, the elder and middle-aged man said nothing, their faces cold as they stood there.

Lu Tian remained still, allowing the black storm to engulf him. It blew his robes and long hair, revealing a gradually cold gaze beneath.

"Ah... you do have some skill. But why does your aura repel me? You carry a Dragon Clan's blood, though well suppressed. Still, I can't miss it!" Qi Ziyang's gaze bore disdain as he looked at Lu Tian.

The Dragon Clan, since the Qilin Clan broke away from beasts to form their own lineage, has always despised beast lineages. They even fought against the Dragon Clan when encountered.

"Did you sense that?" Lu Tian's mind stirred. He hadn't expected Qi Ziyang's senses to be so sharp, detecting his Dragon Clan blood.

"Let go of your Dragon Clan blood. This matter is settled!" Qi Ziyang's face bore calmness as he addressed Lu Tian.

"I'm sorry, but I can't do that," Lu Tian naturally wouldn't let Qi Ziyang dictate him.

"Hmph. How does Fu Xingyue manage his subordinates? Let a person with Dragon Clan blood greet us. Is this an insult to the Qilin Clan? I'll teach you a lesson today!" Qi Ziyang sneered, stepping toward Lu Tian.

Each step he took caused dark mist to rise beneath him. A series of black Qilin figures roared beside him.

"Grand Commander..." Fu Zhiming's face darkened, looking at Lu Tian by his side with a worried expression.

The surrounding Star Moon Guard members bore anger. To them, Lu Tian was revered—only slightly below Fu Xingyue. Qi Ziyang's insults and calling him a subordinate enraged them.

"Remember what I told you? When faced with issues, don't fear. If problems arise, I'll cover for you. If I can't handle it, there's the Second Prince; if he can't, then the old Divine Emperor and Guardians. The Star Moon Divine Clan must not be insulted!" Lu Tian spoke softly, neither retreating nor yielding. He stepped toward Qi Ziyang.

"Roar..." A surge of white Epoch energy and Dao power coalesced beneath Lu Tian, forming a series of white dragons circling him.

"Big talk. I fear you'll fail to handle it!" Qi Ziyang, seeing the dragon symbols rise beside Lu Tian, bore a flicker of surprise before his face twisted into mockery.

Hearing Lu Tian's words, the Star Moon Guard members—including Fu Zhiming—were invigorated. Their gazes burned with fervor as they looked at Lu Tian.

"The Qilin Clan's Young Master is in trouble!" The Star Moon Guard members began to whisper among themselves, for they knew Lu Tian's temperament and strength.

Among the Star Moon Guard, Lu Tian's strength was even greater than Fu Xingyue. Even the Qilin Clan's Young Master couldn't match him.

As they whispered, Lu Tian and Qi Ziyang were now only five zhang apart. A low roar echoed around them.

One black, one white—two natural enemies, locked in a fierce battle. Violent waves of energy radiated from both Lu Tian and Qi Ziyang.

"Stomp... stomp... stomp..." However, after only a brief standoff, the black Qilin figures disintegrated one by one. With each disintegration, Qi Ziyang's body retreated a step, his steps heavy and each retreat causing the ground to tremble. Qi Ziyang's face paled with each step.

"You!" Qi Ziyang's face bore disbelief. He hadn't expected a mere commander to push him back.

"Please have the Qilin Clan's elders proceed to the Divine Emperor's Hall," Lu Tian ignored Qi Ziyang, smiling as he turned his gaze to the middle-aged man and elder.

"Kid, do you think calling us elders means we won't attack you?" The Epoch-Middle middle-aged man smiled, his aura rising steadily.

"Dammit, who's blocking the teleportation array? It's annoying!" Just as the middle-aged man's aura rose toward Lu Tian, a voice shattered through Star Moon City's skies.

Yet this voice caused everyone to shudder. Not because it was powerful, but because the tone was so distinctive—like a duck's call, with a pitch higher than a duck's, making people uncomfortable.

The voice had barely finished when the teleportation array was torn open. A scorching aura spread from the void, golden light flickering as a withered old man appeared in their view.

"A master! Absolutely a master!" Lu Tian's eyes narrowed. Seeing the old man effortlessly tear open space, he was stunned.

"Three little Qilin clashing here!" The old man immediately saw the middle-aged man and elder standing on the teleportation array.

"Little eight-year-old, dare to block my path? You're really seeking death!" The withered old man's eyes bore annoyance as he addressed the two on the teleportation array.

The Qilin Clan's Epoch-End elder, upon seeing the old man's appearance, immediately lost his previous aura. His face changed abruptly, and he and Qi Ziyang fled from the teleportation array, his forehead drenched in sweat—whether from heat or fear was unclear.

Chapter 1330: The Arrival of the Ten Thousand Clans

The withered old man stood in the sky, his body emaciated. At a glance, he seemed as if he could be blown away by the wind. Yet his aura was like a blazing sun, overwhelming and radiant.

"Epoch-End Master!" Lu Tian's heart trembled. He felt the scorching aura pressing against him, his face filled with awe.

"Golden Crow Clan!" The Qilin Clan's Epoch-End elder quickly bowed, his body trembling. He and Qi Ziyang fled from the teleportation array, their foreheads drenched in sweat.

"Ancestral Royal Clan—Golden Crow Clan!" Upon hearing the middle-aged man's words, Lu Tian's face changed. He looked at the old man in the sky.

"The Golden Crow Clan must not be provoked!" Lu Tian recalled Fu Xingyue's earlier words about the Golden Crow Clan. He had only said those few words before ceasing.

The Star Moon Divine Clan's fear of the Golden Crow Clan showed its strength.

"The Golden Crow Clan is domineering and eccentric. Sometimes they turn on a dime, showing no sentiment. If one offends the Golden Crow Clan, they'll retaliate bloodily!"

"Once, a royal clan offended the Golden Crow Clan. The result was that they were burned alive for seven days and nights, their entire continent turned to ash," Fu Zhiming stood beside Lu Tian, transmitting these details.

"The Golden Crow Clan are madmen. They killed every living being on the continent, burning it to nothing!" Fu Zhiming's heart trembled.

"Madmen indeed!" Lu Tian shivered, gazing at the withered old man in the sky, his face also trembling.

"Golden Crow Elder, I didn't know you were coming. My apologies for delaying your teleportation," the Qilin Clan's Epoch-End elder spoke respectfully, offering a precious item of the Qilin Clan.

"Zi..." The withered old man waved his hand, taking the jade bottle. He opened its seal, releasing a fragrant aroma into the air before downing it in one gulp. His eyes showed satisfaction.

"Good, good. The little Qilin has a kind heart. I haven't had this in a while!" The old man nodded in satisfaction.

"Respectful, Elder," the Qilin Clan's elder's lips twitched. His heart was bleeding; that Qilin Elixir was his life's accumulation, now consumed by this old man in one gulp.

"Buzz..." Teleportation energy surged into view, golden light flickering. The scorching aura intensified as a figure in golden light appeared.

"Ten... ten..." A Star Moon Guard member spoke, his eyes trembling as he gazed at the ten figures emerging from the teleportation array, their auras radiating power.

"Golden Crow Ten Princes!" Lu Tian's heart jolted. Seeing the ten figures with powerful auras, their weakest was half-Epoch strength—top-tier prodigies destined for enlightenment.

"Unbelievable!" Lu Tian sighed, gazing at the ten young men like blazing suns, seemingly of his age.
