At this moment, seeing Gu Tianshu say the same thing, Gu Lei finally believed the news. His eyes trembled as he gazed at Luo Tian, the blow this information had dealt him was immense. Luo Tian was the pillar of their group and even the entire Nine Realms, now reduced to such a fate. Gu Lei felt sorrowful.

"But I'm curious, how did you manage it? When I was at the peak of Sainthood, I was suppressed here. Now that you've had issues with your cultivation, why are you still free to move?" Gu Tianshu's voice carried bewilderment as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian wore a faint bitter smile, recounting the events of that day to Gu Tianshu. Gu Tianshu's brows furrowed tightly.

"The Book of Epochs, truly a mysterious treasure!" Gu Tianshu lightly shook his head, retrieving a single sacred herb and a jade vial containing refined blood.

"One sacred herb is enough for me. Having more would be redundant on me. Both of you stay here for these days. I'll teach you how to temporarily break the Heavenly Dao's seal. For many years, I've been suppressed by this fellow, and I have quite a few insights!"

"Also, you—stay with me to cultivate. Don't go out until you reach Sainthood. If Luo Tian hadn't been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao, he would already be in the middle of Sainthood. You're still floundering at the Superhuman stage, truly embarrassing me Gu Tianshu!" Gu Tianshu spoke to them with a hint of dissatisfaction, then swallowed the sacred herb and completely absorbed the refined blood into his body.

The refined blood of a Saint's peak, along with an unparalleled sacred herb—even Gu Tianshu took half a day to fully absorb both.

With the support of the sacred herb and refined blood, Gu Tianshu's entire aura underwent a complete transformation. It was as if a stagnant pool had been awakened, his complexion now bearing a faint hue of vitality.

"Excellent. Indeed, the sacred herb and the refined blood of a Saint's peak. With this, I can live another three to five centuries without moving!" Gu Tianshu's face bore a faint smile.

"You son truly have fated fortune. How did you manage to obtain thirteen complete drops of a Saint's peak's refined blood, even including the heart's blood!" Gu Tianshu looked at Luo Tian with a touch of regret.

Regretting that such a prodigy as Luo Tian had been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao. If it couldn't be undone, he would eventually perish and fade from this epoch.

"Ah..." Gu Tianshu's long sigh echoed through the space, his voice aged and weary.

"Qi is cultivated to be upright without harm... the body remains serene..." The deep, aged voices rose within Luo Tian's mind. At the same time, Gu Lei heard different voices.

Gu Lei and Luo Tian felt a slight tremor in their minds. They sat cross-legged on the ground, closed their eyes, and listened intently. The entire space fell into silence.

They sat for seven days. After seven days, Luo Tian opened his eyes, a sigh on his face—Gu Tianshu truly was an expert-level being. He had devised a way to temporarily break the Heavenly Dao's seal.

Yet, Luo Tian felt bitter. This method was of little use to him. His current state lacked the divine energy that continuously nourished his body, preventing further cultivation.

It wasn't that he couldn't cultivate. It was just that his progress was as slow as a snail's pace. Perhaps after thousands of years, he would reach the peak of Sainthood like Gu Tianshu and end his days in solitude. The only thing he had over Gu Tianshu was the freedom to move.

Thousands of years in this great age—others might have become superpowerful masters at the epoch's peak. What was a Saint's peak compared to that? With so many enemies, if even one Saint's late stage reached out for him, trouble would come.

"Don't be disheartened. You're far stronger than I was back then. If I had been able to move freely, perhaps I wouldn't be in this pitiful state now. Nothing is absolute in the world. The Heavenly Dao may be terrifying, but it's not invincible!" Gu Tianshu smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

"For many years, I've fought against the Heavenly Dao. I've concluded that to completely break this suppression, one must use something even more dominant than the Heavenly Dao!" Gu Tianshu spoke, his voice filled with longing.

Luo Tian heard Gu Tianshu's words and felt even more bitterness. A force stronger than the Heavenly Dao—did such a thing truly exist in the Nine Realms?

"First, you enter the Epoch Stage. Using the Fan Tian Attack Technique, perhaps it could be broken. But that's too difficult! Second is to find what I said—something stronger than the Heavenly Dao. Only these two methods!"

"The only force in this world that can rival the Heavenly Dao is the divine and ultimate Epoch Lord!" Gu Tianshu's eyes gleamed with hope. He had once had a chance to reach the Epoch Lord, but now he was in this state.

"Grandfather Gu, you're still... what's left of the Epoch Lords in this world!" Luo Tian shook his head, also believing the second path was unreachable.

"The Nine Perilous Lands! The Nine Perilous Lands contain terrifying power. Even the Epoch Lords must be cautious. Some places are said to have buried Epoch Lords within them. Fortune favors the bold. If you can't find another way, take a risk!" Gu Tianshu spoke solemnly to Luo Tian.

"Again the Nine Perilous Lands. When Cao Yuanshan spoke before, he said that Yulong Valley might help break the Heavenly Dao's suppression. It's exactly what Grandfather Gu said!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, nodding slightly.

"Alright, I'm fine. I can still live for a long time. Let this kid stay here! I've been suppressed for so many years, even with my lifespan running out, I never gave up. You're young; your path is still long!" Gu Tianshu spoke gently, his voice encouraging.

"Yes," Luo Tian nodded. He had never given up on continuing to cultivate, after all, there were many people he needed to protect.

Luo Tian bid farewell to Gu Tianshu, finally putting aside a burden in his heart. At least for the next few centuries, he wouldn't have to worry about Gu Tianshu's end.

"Perhaps a few centuries is enough!" Luo Tian rose from the ground, exhaling deeply. He returned to the grand hall where the others were staying. At that moment, Xu Liyi and five others sat with serious expressions exchanging thoughts. Upon seeing Luo Tian appear, they all set down their tea cups and approached Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, you finally came out. If you hadn't come out soon, we would have gone down to find you!" Xu Liyi spoke solemnly, his voice carrying a touch of gravity.

"Huh? What's wrong?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows and asked, having only been away for a few days. Surely nothing major had happened.

"It's not a big deal, but the Nine Realms have had a major event these days! The entire Nine Realms seem to be in chaos!" Zheng Xin spoke, his usual carefree demeanor replaced.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows again, scanning the group with a questioning gaze.

"It's not really a big deal. The Nine Realms have had major events these days! It almost overshadowed your spotlight!" Xu Liyi spoke, his voice carrying a touch of regret.

"A million beasts have gathered in the Beast Domain. Three Saint's peak leaders are marching towards the Shura Domain, obviously because of the previous disturbance in the Beast Domain that made them feel embarrassed. They plan to show Shura Domain a lesson!"

"The other event is related to you. The major sects and noble families have set their sights on the Ancient Palace of Epochs. They've asked the domain master of Star Luo to calculate its location and plan a large-scale attack, all hoping to bring the Ancient Palace under their control!" The group spoke in unison, recounting these two major events to Luo Tian.

"The other news is directly related to you. Shura City has received a contract—someone paid heavily for your head! Though we don't know who hired them, it's clear someone doesn't want you to continue living!" Their gazes carried concern as they looked at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, his gaze turning deep. Three major events—especially the latter two. As for the Ancient Palace of Epochs, Luo Tian didn't need to worry; Meng Lingxiao had said that anyone entering the palace would be marked for death.

What troubled Luo Tian was the last event. Shura City, known as a place where no one could escape death, now had taken this contract. It seemed they weren't too concerned about the Beast Domain's attack.

As for those wanting to kill him, Luo Tian didn't need to guess. It was none other than the few sects that had a grudge against him.

"Since you want to play, I'll play with you!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed a cruel glint. A smile appeared on his lips.

Chapter 1023: Soul Lamp Extinguished

The Nine Realms, as the Beast Domain launched a major attack on the Shura Domain, the entire Nine Realms became turbulent. The Nine Realms were now focused on two things: one was the battle between the Beast Domain and Shura Domain, and the second was the result of major sects attacking the Ancient Palace of Epochs.

Although Luo Tian still had attention, it wasn't as intense. He was fortunate to have some leisure time.

In the Fire Domain, Luo Tian was discussing with Nan Gong Yuqing when to return to the Four Sacred Star Realms' Tiger Fortress to retrieve Elder Zun. Their strength had increased, and they no longer feared the魔族's Saint-level threats. However, they weren't too hasty; they slowly made their way towards the Four Sacred Star Realms.

Now, with tensions rising in the Nine Realms, it didn't include the Fire Domain and Four Sacred Star Realms. After all, both star realms ranked last in the Nine Realms; battles between major domains wouldn't spread to them immediately.

Yet, as they walked, Luo Tian's face suddenly turned pale, causing him to stop and his eyes showed a hint of panic.

"What's wrong?" The five saw this, their faces showing confusion. They didn't know what had happened to Luo Tian, who suddenly seemed soulless.

"Ten Xiong, set up the Cross-Space Transference array. We need to return to the Four Sacred Star Realms quickly!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with urgency, a deep sense of unease in his heart as he spoke to Wan Lingkong.

"Okay!" Wan Lingkong didn't know why Luo Tian was so urgent, but seeing the determined look in his eyes, he knew it wasn't simple. The only thing that could make Luo Tian so anxious was something happening in the Tianyuan Star Realms.

"My soul lamp! It's extinguished!" Luo Tian's eyes showed urgency, his face as pale as a sheet of paper. His gaze was directed towards the Four Sacred Star Realms.

"What!" The group's faces showed great alarm, their eyes also filled with anxiety.

"How could it be? How could a soul lamp go out! Did the Tianyuan Star Realms get destroyed?" Zheng Xin shouted, his voice trembling.

Their foundations were all in the Four Sacred Star Realms. Their family, friends—should anything happen to their star realms, they would be heartbroken and unsure if they could bear it.

"Ten Xiong, can you hurry!" Zheng Xin couldn't help but urge impatiently.

"You bastard, setting up Cross-Space Transference isn't that easy. Don't吵, you do it!" Wan Lingkong's face was drenched in sweat, beads of sweat rolling down his face.

Hearing Wan Lingkong's scolding, Zheng Xin and the others fell silent. Their hearts were filled with prayers for Wan Lingkong to hurry, even Luo Tian's heart was tense, longing to enter the Four Sacred Star Realms immediately.

"It's done!" After an hour, under everyone's expectant gaze, Wan Lingkong sighed deeply and almost fell to the ground.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian led them into the array, but Wan Lingkong hesitated to activate it immediately. His face showed embarrassment as he looked at Luo Tian and the others.

"Um, since it was set up in a hurry, I'm not sure if it can send us to the Tianyuan Star Realms. Maybe we should let one person test it first?" Wan Lingkong spoke to the group, his voice carrying a touch of apology.

"It's troublesome. I'll go first!" Xu Liyi said with an indifferent expression, stepping into the array and telling Wan Lingkong: "Alright, activate it!"

At the same time, Luo Tian and others stepped out of the array. Their faces showed curiosity, especially Luo Tian, who had never seen such a large array before that could cross space.

"Be careful!" Wan Lingkong reminded Xu Liyi, his hands flashing with radiant light. A golden banner flew from his hand, and he looked serious.

The golden banner was inserted into the starry sky. In an instant, a transmission force spread beneath Xu Liyi's feet. The void rose a black hole, and in the next moment, it swallowed Xu Liyi completely, disappearing from sight.

"Uh..." Wan Lingkong scratched his head, a hint of embarrassment on his face as he spoke to the group: "It seems I sent him a bit off course. He was sent back to the Beast Domain!"

"What!" Their mouths twitched as they looked at Wan Lingkong. They hadn't expected him to be so unreliable, sending Xu Liyi back to the Beast Domain.

The Beast Domain and Four Sacred Star Realms were in opposite directions, yet Wan Lingkong had messed it up. It was truly embarrassing.

"Maybe we should just fly back, right? At our speed, it would take three or four days!" Li Tianzhi tentatively asked.

"You what? Are you questioning me?" Wan Lingkong's face turned angry, as if provoked.

"Alright, Ten Xiong. Let's try again! Xu Liyi is in the Beast Domain; it should be fine!" Luo Tian knew Wan Lingkong was somewhat unreliable but still trustworthy. After all, the previous Celestial Punishment array had some flaws, but it was ultimately successful.

Another hour passed. After Wan Lingkong swore to succeed this time, the group finally entered the transmission array.

"Let's go! Four Sacred Star Realms, Tianyuan Star Realms!" Wan Lingkong wore a confident look. He tossed the golden banner into the void, and in an instant, they were swallowed by a black hole. Luo Tian and others disappeared beneath the Fire Domain's starry sky.

"Buzz..." With trepidation, they appeared under a starry sky.

"You bastard... you said it was the Tianyuan Star Realms!" Nan Gong Yuqing couldn't help but curse, his gaze filled with blame as he looked at Wan Lingkong.

"Um, the direction wasn't off. This is the Four Sacred Star Realms. It's just a bit off!" Wan Lingkong looked at the surrounding scenery, his embarrassment slightly reduced. After all, it was the best result that they hadn't been sent to another star realm.

"The result is acceptable!" Luo Tian felt the aura of the Four Sacred Star Realms and sighed deeply. He carefully observed the surroundings, trying to determine which part of the Four Sacred Star Realms they were in. His face immediately turned grim.

"Dammit! This is the Broken God Cliff!" Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with helplessness. His gaze turned to Wan Lingkong, wanting to strangle him.

"What? Broken God Cliff..." The others were stunned as they looked at Luo Tian. They had seen much, but knowing Broken God Cliff was one of the Nine Perilous Lands, their faces turned grim.

"Ten... Ling... Kong..." Zheng Xin, Li Tianzhi, and Nan Gong Yuqing looked at Wan Lingkong, causing him to laugh awkwardly again.

"Dammit, the Nine Perilous Lands! Are we going to die here!" Zheng Xin shouted, as if ready to fight Wan Lingkong.

"Stop吵. This is the foothill. I've been here before! It's not the summit! It's within our capacity!" Luo Tian looked at the familiar scenery. He remembered that terrifying presence in Broken God Cliff back then.

Although his cultivation was only nine-source celestial sovereign at the time, now he had reached early Sainthood. Compared to then, he was leagues ahead.

But it was precisely because of this that Luo Tian felt the magnitude of Broken God Cliff even more. Though he had reached early Sainthood, against that terrifying presence in the cliff walls, he felt he wasn't even a fraction of its finger.

"Still no changes after so many years!" Luo Tian observed the surroundings, and his face showed a touch of nostalgia. He sighed inwardly at how bold he had been to reach the foothill of Broken God Cliff back then.

"Wait, why hasn't it changed!" Luo Tian carefully observed the situation and then showed a look of shock.

"It's exactly as it was when I left. Even the grass and trees haven't grown a single inch!" Luo Tian recalled the situation back then, his face showing a series of expressions.

"Luo Tian, what should we do next? Let's leave quickly. I have a strange feeling here as if someone is watching us," Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, his face filled with strong apprehension. He looked around.

"Could this be the legendary Longevity Land?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, carefully observing and recalling what he had seen when he first came here. It truly looked the same, never changing.

"Longevity Land? Are there really such places in the Nine Realms? And within our Four Sacred Star Realms?" The others showed expressions of shock upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

Longevity Land, since the Nine Realms were born, there have been legends of such a place. It's said that in each epoch, it appears once, and its location varies, possibly appearing anywhere within the Nine Realms.

The greatest use of Longevity Land is to nurture a single medicinal herb, which the Epoch Lord of that epoch would harvest and accompany.

"Unexpectedly, this epoch's Longevity Land is in our Four Sacred Star Realms' Broken God Cliff. It seems the Four Sacred Star Realms will become a place of contention!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, looking at the towering cliffs. He didn't intend to search for the medicinal herb, as it was one of the Nine Perilous Lands. For now, there was no danger, but if they continued to go higher up, even if they didn't die, being trapped for several years would be enough for them.

"Come on, follow me!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with a streak of violet light. He looked around carefully and led them cautiously, no longer flying as before but choosing to walk down the mountain.

"Boom... Boom..." As Luo Tian and others carefully descended the mountain, a sudden thunderous sound reached their ears, causing their brows to furrow slightly.

"Old turtle! I'll see where you run this time!" A mocking voice rang out, like thunder, breaking the silence of Broken God Cliff.

Chapter 1024: The Xuanwu Sect is Destroyed

In the Four Sacred Star Realms, on Broken God Cliff, Luo Tian and others were carefully descending when they had barely taken a few steps. The sky suddenly darkened, thunderous sounds filled the air, causing them to stop.

In an instant, a massive body appeared in their line of sight. Their mouths twitched slightly as they no longer cared and flew out of Broken God Cliff.

"Old turtle! I'll see where you run this time!" Thunderous sounds echoed, and a thousand-foot lightning bolt fell across the sky, striking the massive body.

"Something's wrong!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. He looked at the colossal creature, although it was imposing and powerful, it wouldn't harm him.

"Xuanwu Elder!" Luo Tian carefully observed and immediately recognized the colossal creature as Xuanwu, the guardian beast of the Xuanwu Sect in the Four Sacred Star Realms.

However, Xuanwu now looked pitiful. His entire belly was stained with blood, and a deep wound like a mountain range appeared on his belly. It was terrifying.

The seemingly indestructible turtle shell on Xuanwu's back was full of cracks. Clearly, it had suffered severe injuries. Cracks in the shell were filled with lightning that continuously flowed through them, a sight that was heart-wrenching.

Luo Tian didn't hesitate. When he first left the Tianyuan Star Realms, Xuanwu had shown him kindness. Now that Xuanwu was in trouble, how could Luo Tian ignore it?

"Elder!" Luo Tian waved his hands. Two golden divine energy hands appeared, and a series of golden seals hummed out, instantly catching the massive Xuanwu.

"Roar..." A deep roar echoed from Xuanwu's mouth, its voice filled with endless sorrow. It startled Luo Tian and the others slightly.

"Luo Tian!" Xuanwu saw Luo Tian, his head swayed. His crimson eyes regained a bit of clarity and then transformed into human form before Luo Tian.

"Cough... cough..." As Xuanwu turned into a human, another figure also appeared in front of Luo Tian and the others. The figure was haphazard, and his eyes were slightly stunned.

The haphazard figure wasn't anyone else but the sect master of Xuanwu Sect, Chen Xuanning. This made Luo Tian and the others gasp.

"Elder, what happened?" Luo Tian asked, his voice filled with concern. Baihu Sect was a powerful sect in the Four Sacred Star Realms, its strength no less than that of Tianyuan Star Realms. Yet it was so pitiful now, making Luo Tian even more worried about the safety of Tianyuan Star Realms.

"Wait a moment. Let's go first. There are pursuers behind us, one of whom is at the middle stage of Sainthood and two at the early stage. You all go quickly! I'll hold them back. Remember to avenge us."

"Ha ha, old turtle! Just because you're half a Saint, do you think you can hold them back? That's really an absurd idea!" Xuanwu's words hadn't finished when several figures arrived at the entrance of Broken God Cliff. They looked at Xuanwu with mockery.

Lightning flashed, and several figures were all carrying lightning. As Xuanwu said, one was at the middle stage of Sainthood and two were at the early stage. Behind them were several young people at the Superhuman level.

"Old turtle, don't blame others. Blame your Four Sacred Star Realms' Luo Tian for killing our Thunder Domain's Saint Son. How dare a single Four Sacred Star Realms provoke us? You're really living too long!" The leader of the group spoke to Xuanwu, ignoring Luo Tian and others.

"Thunder Domain!" Luo Tian's face bore a cruel look. His cold gaze swept over the group of ten people.

Zheng Xin and others also looked at the group with cold eyes, their gazes filled with a storm of killing intent.

"Li Jinglong. It's really an awkward meeting! Do you still remember me, Li Tianzhi?" Li Tianzhi stood behind the group. Thunderlight flowed from his hands, forming a long sword that looked at the middle-stage elder.

"Oh?" After Li Tianzhi spoke, the middle-stage elder took a closer look at Luo Tian and others. His eyes suddenly narrowed.

"Li Tianzhi? You're still alive!" The elder's eyes flashed with shock, looking at Li Tianzhi as if seeing a ghost. After all, it was he who had once thrown Li Tianzhi like trash into the abyss of thunder seas.

"Unexpected? Yes, I'm still alive. Ha!" Li Tianzhi laughed coldly. He knew that today none of these people would survive. Although he was at the half-Saint level, with Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing by his side, even if there were more than a few Saint middle-levels, they would completely annihilate these people.

"Surviving doesn't mean much. Just because you have three Saint early-levels here, today I'll finish them all..." Jinglong's words hadn't finished when his gaze fell on Luo Tian, and he showed a look of panic.

"Luo... Luo Tian!" Li Jinglong stammered, looking at Luo Tian and stood there speechless.

Luo Tian's name was now known throughout the Nine Realms. Especially since Li Xingteng and Li Maode had both died at Luo Tian's hands, the Nine Realms' major sects had spread Luo Tian's portrait and warned their disciples not to provoke this demon-like figure.

"It's me!" Luo Tian's face bore a furious killing intent. His gaze fell on the three elders, then he thought of the terrifying cracks on Xuanwu's back.

Xuanwu's back carried the entire Xuanwu Star Realms. All the disciples and elders of Xuanwu Sect were on Xuanwu's back. But what he had seen was that there was no sign of life on Xuanwu's back, only Chen Xuanning. It was simple: the entire sect of Xuanwu, hundreds of thousands of people, had all been killed by these ten people.

Deep hatred! Thinking about the hundreds of thousands who died because he had killed someone from Thunder Domain, Luo Tian's whole body trembled. Today these ten people would definitely die. Not only them, but blood debts must be repaid with blood. Even if it meant exposing the Ancient Palace of Epochs, Luo Tian would uproot Thunder Domain's Xingyao Sect!

"Luo Tian, what do you want to do? The Thunder Domain has a Saint peak elder coming. Don't be reckless!" The elder clearly lost his former boldness.

"What do I want to do? Kill you!" Luo Tian swung his spear, not caring if it was in the Perilous Land of Broken God Cliff. He transformed into a streak of golden light and rushed toward the elder.

Nan Gong Yuqing's body was filled with blood qi. Li Tianzhi was his brother, so he had long wanted to kill the Thunder Domain. Now encountering people from the Thunder Domain, he wouldn't hold back. The blood-colored sword about to evolve into a blood-hungry weapon hummed, stirring the heavens and earth. It intercepted the two middle-stage elders in front of him.

"Ha ha, little brats! Come on!" Zheng Xin wore a mocking expression. His golden hands slammed down, knocking the remaining young people at the Superhuman level.

Wan Lingkong and Li Tianzhi also had a killing intent. One intercepted a young person at the Superhuman level and fought with him.

"Luo Tian..." Xuanwu's face bore a worried expression. After all, Luo Tian was only at the early stage of Sainthood. He knew how terrifying that middle-stage elder was.

But before Xuanwu could finish speaking, he was stunned in place. His gaze turned to the battle in the sky, his face showing shock.

Crushing! Zheng Xin had entered the early stage of Sainthood during his time in the Beast Domain. Facing several Superhuman-level Thunder Domain people, he completely crushed them.

Nan Gong Yuqing's side was also a one-on-two battle. Yet he still firmly suppressed the opponent, and within moments, both middle-stage elders were covered in wounds and coughing blood.

What shocked Xuanwu most was Luo Tian's side. The entire world thundered, and Luo Tian clashed with the middle-stage elder without any signs of defeat. He even firmly suppressed him.

"What kind of combat power is this? Early-stage Saint against middle-stage Saint!" Xuanwu muttered, his old face streaming tears.

"The children of the Xuanwu Sect. You've avenged your grudge!" Xuanwu had guarded the Xuanwu Sect for generations. He was most attached to it. Now that his enemies had been slain, even after living countless years, he was overjoyed.

"Let them live!" Luo Tian transmitted to the others with his mind, casting a glance at Chen Xuanning's condition.

With Luo Tian's transmission, Nan Gong Yuqing and the others slowed their attack. Especially Zheng Xin, who was somewhat frustrated. These Superhuman-level people were one by one thrown in front of Xuanwu and Chen Xuanning. But now they had to slow their attack, which was somewhat uncomfortable.

"Boom... boom... boom..." Several figures were thrown in front of Xuanwu and Chen Xuanning by Zheng Xin.

Within a moment, one middle-stage elder and several Superhuman-level people were all incapacitated. They fell to the ground, at the mercy of their captors.

In the sky, Nan Gong Yuqing and Luo Tian each took one. Nan Gong's side was absolutely dominant. Luo Tian's side also thundered and clashed, with a wild wave of power striking the Broken God Cliff. Surprisingly, it didn't move even one blade of grass on the cliff.

"Boom..." The sound of a battered figure fell to the ground. The Thunder Domain's middle-stage elder was pierced through the chest by Nan Gong Yuqing, his cultivation sealed and fell before them.

Xuanwu's face bore an expression of disbelief. He hadn't expected that after just a few years, they had become so terrifying. In an instant, they had subdued those who could have destroyed the Xuanwu Sect.

In the sky, only Luo Tian and Li Jinglong's battle remained. People's attention was drawn to the sky.

"This is Luo Tian's first time fighting a middle-stage Saint with his true strength!" Zheng Xin stood on the face of a Thunder Domain Superhuman-level disciple, crossed his arms and spoke lightly.

"Yes, that's true. He didn't use any of the three pseudo-Epoch Relics. Luo Tian is testing his combat power, isn't he?" Nan Gong Yuqing nodded, looking at Luo Tian who was suppressing the middle-stage elder. His face showed admiration.

Chapter 1025: Outburst

On the sky of Broken God Cliff, Luo Tian's face bore endless coldness. His entire body was filled with golden light. His spear danced, each streak of the spear carrying overwhelming power.

Luo Tian's current strength was immense. Facing a middle-stage Saint, he had no fear. If the opponent didn't have any special techniques, Luo Tian was confident in defeating him.

"Luo Tian, don't be too much. Killing us will have others to destroy you!" The elder howled, surprised that Luo Tian was truly so strong. He had been suppressed by a early-stage Saint and was constantly injured.

"Luo Tian, you're too much. Killing us will have others to destroy you!" The elder howled, surprised that Luo Tian was truly so strong. He had been suppressed by a early-stage Saint and was constantly injured.

"Lightning of Nine Skies!" Li Jinglong finally exploded with rage. He knew that if he didn't fight back, he would be killed by Luo Tian.

Golden divine lightning descended from the nine skies, forming a sea of thunder. It lit up the entire sky and formed a net of lightning. Each bolt was like divine punishment, capable of killing an early-stage Saint and wounding a middle-stage one.

But Luo Tian was fearless against the middle-stage Saint. His reincarnation body was extremely powerful, his blood and qi surged. He looked like a golden-armored warrior, his eyes filled with endless battle intent.

"Thunder Domain, one Saint peak has died. It still isn't enough pain!" Luo Tian clenched his fists tightly, one punch aimed at the lightning net above the sky. His body was completely fearless, and his body emitted a series of dragon roars, rushing toward the lightning net.

"Arrogant. You really dared to use your body to withstand my Lightning of Nine Skies? That's really overconfident!" Li Jinglong wore a look of contempt. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so arrogant.

If Luo Tian had used one pseudo-Epoch Relic, he would have fled desperately. But Luo Tian hadn't used any, which made Li Jinglong think of something.

If he could kill Luo Tian, then those three pseudo-Epoch Relics would be his. Wealth moved the heart. Imagine that even a senior of Thunder Domain hadn't managed to defeat Luo Tian, but he had obtained them. What kind of honor would that be?

"Crack..." But a thunderous sound shattered Li Jinglong's daydream, making his face pale.

"Old dog. Did you finish your daydream? Finished, I'll cut you down!" Luo Tian stood in the sky, his body filled with lightning. It didn't harm him at all, moving like a snake around him. His divine body glowed.

"Luo Tian, how strong you've become!" Xuanwu's face bore disbelief as he looked at the mighty Luo Tian in the sky. He was truly shocked by Luo Tian's power.

Previously, it was this move that had killed eight out of ten Xuanwu Sect disciples. He himself had barely escaped, using all his strength to flee to Broken God Cliff in search of a chance.

"How..." Li Jinglong hadn't expected Luo Tian to truly break his technique and remain unharmed.

"Send you to your death!" Luo Tian transformed into a streak of divine lightning. He stepped on the幽冥鬼步 and instantly appeared in front of the elder, piercing his throat with a spear.

"Boom..." The Fan Tian Attack Technique entered the elder's body, turning him into a mist of blood that floated in the sky.

"Monster!" Zheng Xin couldn't help but snort. Although he knew Luo Tian's strength was great, he still couldn't help but admire.

"Unfortunately, if we can't find a way to break the Heavenly Dao's suppression, Luo Tian's life is over!" The group furrowed their brows slightly, thinking of Luo Tian's condition.

"In a few decades or even centuries, the great talents will have grown. Only Luo Tian remains stagnant. That would be his most painful time!" Nan Gong Yuqing shook his head lightly. The Heavenly Dao had now become a thorn in the hearts of all.

"In that era, people like Feng Jiutian would definitely have reached the late stage of Sainthood. How could Luo Tian survive in such an era with so many enemies?"

"Strengthen, everyone. Now that Luo Tian is invincible, he protects us. If Luo Tian truly stops at the early stage of Sainthood, then we will have to take over!" Wan Lingkong's face bore admiration.

"This epoch is destined to be a great age. Even the reincarnation body and the primordial body have appeared simultaneously. And Luo Tian's daughter Xi Ting is also a spiritual body. This has already seen three bodies. I wonder if nine bodies will appear in this epoch!" The group's faces bore admiration, suddenly feeling that being born in this epoch was quite tragic.

They were originally outstanding people of their time, but compared to Luo Tian, they were far behind. Even Feng Jiutian was slightly better than them. Although they weren't satisfied, they knew that Feng Jiutian could definitely suppress them. Except for Nan Gong Yuqing, no one had better talent than Feng Jiutian.

"Ah..." Xuanwu sighed deeply. He knew this era didn't belong to them old-timers anymore.

"Boom... boom..." The thunderous sound rose in the sky. Luo Tian reduced the elder's cultivation to early-stage Saint, leaving no chance for him to escape.
