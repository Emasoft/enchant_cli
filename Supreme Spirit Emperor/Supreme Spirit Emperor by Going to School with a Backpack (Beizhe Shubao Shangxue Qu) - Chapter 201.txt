“Heaven’s calamity may be endured, but self-inflicted misfortune cannot!” Sun Shengjie sneered, sensing the faint life force of Luotian within the deep pit. His vitality was fading rapidly.

Yet in an instant, a storm erupted within the chasm, sending shivers through Sun Shengjie’s heart. His expression hardened in disbelief.

“How is this possible? How has his life force returned so swiftly—so suddenly!” Sun Shengjie cried out, his voice trembling.

“Rippling… rippling…” The sound of waves echoed within the pit, a titanic aura spreading into people’s minds.

“Not enough!” Luotian smiled faintly, his body rising like a mountain. He appeared before them instantly, gazing at the sky with fierce battle spirit.

Though others could not sense Luotian’s transformation, he felt his core and body had undergone a miraculous metamorphosis. His flesh radiated golden light, faint green mist swirling around him. The golden vortex in his core—once like a small stream—now expanded into a lake, swirling with radiant golden energy.

“Still not perfect,” Luotian murmured, feeling his body’s state. Risk and opportunity coexisted; he had nearly perished but for his nearing the Saintly Realm. Had he not been on the verge of entering it, he might have succumbed.

A humming sound returned. In the gray chaos, a golden mountain slowly emerged from the storm clouds.

Its colossal form obscured the sky, shaking people’s minds. Even Luotian, gazing at the “Sin” carved into the mountain, cursed aloud: “Damn you, old heaven! When Ancient Ancestor fought to enter the Epoch Realm, you used this mountain. Now I’ve barely ascended to Saintly, and you still seek to crush me!”

Luotian’s eyes burned with madness as he stared at the golden mountain ready to annihilate him.

The mountain thundered, instantly descending upon Luotian’s head. His mind trembled with fierce resentment, a wild fury rising within him.

“Haha! Even heaven refuses to let you live. Daring to curse the Dao—how foolish! To be crushed by a mountain of the Dao while ascending to Saintly Realm—this is my first time witnessing such a fate!” Sun Shengjie sneered, convinced Luotian was already dead. Even in full strength, he could not resist the mountain’s might; it could wound even a Saintly Realm mid-stage. Luotian, barely at the threshold of Saintly Realm, had no chance.

“Ancient Ancestor could do it—so can I!” Luotian’s eyes flashed madness. His fists clenched, radiating golden light as fierce battle spirit surged from him.

“Rumble… rumble…” Lightning crackled. The golden mountain, bearing immense pressure, arrived instantly above Luotian.

“Break it!” Luotian bent his legs like a golden phoenix, leaping skyward. He advanced instead of retreating, appearing beneath the mountain and striking with a fist.

“Crack!” The golden fist collided with the mountain. The entire Tongtian Continent trembled, an invisible wave striking everyone, flinging them thousands of feet away. Some with weaker cultivation turned pale, spitting blood.

Luotian’s body was instantly crushed back into the pit.

“Too strong!” Luotian spat blood, his mind ringing like thunder as he descended underground.

Meanwhile, the golden mountain’s power remained undiminished, crashing into the pit.

“Haha! You’re done now!” Sun Shengjie grinned, certain Luotian could not withstand the mountain. Even he would be crushed to death.

Luotian’s gaze remained resolute as the golden mountain descended upon him.

“Boom!” The mountain crushed down, sending Sun Shengjie into joyous triumph.

In stunned silence, Luotian was struck by the mountain and turned into a mist of blood, floating within the pit.

“Luotian!” Wang Xuanyang roared, disbelief in his eyes. A mist of blood meant certain death—no soul escaped.

“Dead!” Sun Shengjie sighed, a smile on his face.

Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian also sighed, gazing at the blood mist. They mourned the fall of a prodigy.

Golden light surged, radiant energy swirling into a storm within the pit. The pit expanded again.

“Hmph. Arrogant brat! You’re too bold!” Sun Shengjie coldly spoke, gazing at the blood mist.

All of Tongtian Sect remained silent. Luotian was their last hope. If he died, they could not withstand Sun Shengjie and Han Guangxian. With no signs of life, they likely would not survive.

A moment later, Sun Shengjie’s eyes widened in shock. “Impossible!”

“Huh?” Hearing Sun Shengjie’s exclamation, everyone turned to the blood mist.

“What’s happening?” Their faces bore disbelief as Luotian’s blood mist gradually coalesced.

At the same time, the swirling golden energy storm rushed toward Luotian’s blood, forming a cocoon-like object hovering in the pit.

“Could there be another twist?” Sun Shengjie’s gaze darkened, his killing intent rising again.

“Kill!” Sun Shengjie leaped skyward, summoning the Refining Soul Vessel to attack the golden cocoon.

Yet his powerful strike met no resistance. The energy seemed absorbed by the golden cocoon instead.

Sun Shengjie was stunned, unsure if his attack would help or harm Luotian. He dared not strike recklessly.

“Hmph. I’ll deal with your subordinates first!” Though he feared the cocoon, Sun Shengjie turned to attack Song Yongkang and Wang Xuanyang.

“Boom!” Just as Sun Shengjie prepared to strike, a series of heartbeats echoed in his ears.

In an instant, the golden cocoon radiated brilliant light. A strange aura shook Sun Shengjie, leaving people in awe.

“Crack!” A fissure formed on the cocoon. A green-clad figure emerged, bathed in golden energy, opening his eyes to gaze at Sun Shengjie and the others.

Sun Shengjie’s mind was struck by lightning. His eyes bore intense fear.

“Luotian! He’s alive again! Blood-rebirth—this is the mark of a Saintly Realm!” Song Yongkang’s face lit with joy, his voice filled with excitement.

Saints were rare—only the three sect masters of Fire Domain held this realm. If Luotian had entered Saintly Realm, no one else could oppose Tongtian Sect. Perhaps it would become the fourth sect in Fire Domain.

“Finally succeeded!” Luotian glanced at his fists, smooth as jade. He inhaled deeply, absorbing golden spiritual energy into his body.

“Rippling… rippling…” Waves echoed in Luotian’s core. His core expanded again, like a golden ocean, surging with waves.

“Saintly Realm’s initial stage—wonderful!” Luotian clenched his fists, savoring his strength. He vanished before Sun Shengjie, a green fist striking.

Sun Shengjie’s gaze flickered with concern. He hadn’t expected Luotian to move so fast, and before he could react, Luotian’s fist struck his chest.

“Crack!” A crisp sound echoed. Sun Shengjie’s entire chest caved in, colliding with Tongtian Mountain. His eyes widened in disbelief.

Sun Shengjie had been wounded from prior battles, his strength barely enough to withstand a half-step Saint. How could he endure Luotian’s initial-stage Saintly Realm strike?

“Old dog, your time has come! Today I’ll erase you completely!” Luotian’s eyes flashed coldly. He vanished before Sun Shengjie again, stomping down.

“Both of you—why are you just standing there? Fight! Wait for this brat to kill me first, then attack!” Sun Shengjie panicked, shouting at Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian.

Hearing Sun Shengjie’s command, the two snapped out of their stupor and rushed toward Luotian.

“Hmph. Just the two of you! Go away…” Luotian sneered, lightning crackling. The two froze instantly, their faces pale.

“Roar!” As Luotian’s voice faded, a thunderous dragon roar echoed in people’s ears.

Chapter 907: Eliminating Sun Shengjie

Above Tongtian Sect, Luotian stood coldly before Sun Shengjie: “Old dog, did you ever think this day would come? Remember when you chased me to the ends of heaven and earth?”

Sun Shengjie’s face paled. He hadn’t expected Luotian to suppress and crush him so swiftly.

“Brat, I am a divine clan member. My divine clan has an elder at the Saintly Realm peak. Are you sure you want to kill me?” Sun Shengjie, knowing even at his prime he couldn’t match Luotian, threatened.

“Idiot. If I don’t kill you, will the divine clan let me live?” Luotian remained calm, kicking Sun Shengjie’s face.

Though Luotian was at the Saintly Realm peak, he wasn’t reckless. From the Epoch Book, he knew that elders at the Saintly Realm peak rarely emerged. If they did, it was usually to consume life essence—something saints valued dearly. Unless in dire need, they wouldn’t risk it.

Luotian kicked Sun Shengjie away, smiling as he gazed at the mountain’s base. A thunderous dragon roar echoed in people’s ears, shaking their minds.

“That dragon!” People knew Luotian was accompanied by a dragon clan member with pure bloodline. Hearing the roar, they naturally thought of Long Jie.

A massive pressure returned, making people gasp. Especially Song Yongkang’s face lit with joy: “Supreme Stage!”

“Did he ascend?” Luotian, now at the initial stage of Saintly Realm, felt Long Jie’s ascension. He hadn’t expected it to be so fast—jumping from Eight Source Heaven Sovereign to Supreme Stage. Such talent was astonishing.

“Indeed, the dragon clan’s bloodline is pure!” Luotian sighed, ignoring Long Jie. He knew that with Long Jie at Supreme Stage, no one else among them could harm him.

“You may die now!” Luotian coldly spoke, kicking Sun Shengjie’s head again. The kick nearly split his skull.

“Luotian, I’ll fight you to the death!” Sun Shengjie’s face twisted with madness. He raised the Refining Soul Vessel, determined to fight.

“Hum…” The vessel hummed. Stars hung upside down as Sun Shengjie poured all his strength, even burning his blood to unleash terrifying power toward Luotian.

Luotian sneered, unafraid of the attack. His body radiated golden light, becoming a streak of brilliance that appeared beside the Refining Soul Vessel. He struck with a fist.

“Crack!” Under the clear sky, it darkened again. A crisp sound echoed as the green Refining Soul Vessel cracked, leaving people in awe.

“A fist shattered a saintly artifact! My heavens, how strong is his body? No one else could forge it like the ancient Gu Tianzu!” Song Yongkang sighed, gazing at Luotian standing proudly in the sky.

“I once triggered a mountain to crush me when I fought for the Epoch Realm. This brat has already done it—stronger than me! I wish to see him fight for the Epoch Realm!” Gu Tianzu smiled bitterly, sitting underground, watching Luotian.

Meanwhile, Sun Shengjie’s powerful attack struck Luotian. Even a Saintly Realm initial stage would be wounded by this, but Luotian stood unmoved, his body radiant like jade.

A terrifying spiritual energy storm swept over him. After the storm passed, people saw Luotian standing there, radiant and unshaken.

“This…” Sun Shengjie was stunned. His desperate attack had done nothing to Luotian.

“Is he even human?” Sun Shengjie’s heart trembled. His face finally showed terror, blood trickling from his mouth—his Refining Soul Vessel had been damaged.

Luotian grew impatient. His eyes flashed coldness as his hands moved swiftly, golden light flashing. A sun emerged from his palms—Zhen Tian’s Seal.

“Die now!” Luotian pushed his hands forward. The Zhen Tian’s Seal roared toward Sun Shengjie.

At Saintly Realm initial stage, Luotian’s Zhen Tian’s Seal could kill a half-step saint or wound an initial-stage saint. Sun Shengjie, weaker than a half-step saint, had no chance against Luotian’s full power.

“Boom!” The seal struck Sun Shengjie, sending him crashing into Tongtian Mountain’s wall. He turned into blood, golden saintly blood splattering the mountain. Song Yongkang and others were shocked.

Golden saintly blood slowly coalesced, attempting to revive. But Luotian stood unmoved.

“Ancient Ancestor, I heard absorbing blood essence extends life. Here’s this for you. There are two more to come—hope they can keep you alive a few more years!” Luotian gazed at the golden blood on Tongtian Mountain, transmitting to Gu Tianzu.

“Haha. Kind of you. With these three’s life essence, I can last another year or two,” Gu Tianzu sighed, sitting underground. He waved his hand, light flashing.

In an instant, Sun Shengjie’s saintly blood merged into the mountain. Gu Tianzu refined it into his withered body.

“Good. Another year,” Gu Tianzu sighed. At the peak of Saintly Realm, he could extend his life by extracting life essence from others—this was how the Nine Saints of the Demon Domain had survived for countless years. But this method was cruel, and Gu Tianzu despised it.

Luotian’s face remained cold as he gazed at Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian. To him, they were no more than strong insects before a Saintly Realm initial stage.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luotian smiled, standing still. His hand waved, a Saintly Realm initial stage pressure sweeping over them. A golden hand with faint green mist grabbed them.

“Luotian, we’re sorry! We’ll be your slaves!” Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian, terrified, were crushed to the ground. They begged for mercy.

“Dream on. You’re not worthy!” Luotian sneered, lifting them before him.

“Roar…” As Luotian was about to finish them, a golden dragon soared into the sky. Long Jie’s true form appeared, circling above Tongtian Mountain.

“Brother, let me handle them. I need practice!” Long Jie transformed into human form, his face excited.

“Good!” Luotian waved his hand, releasing Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian. He spoke: “This is your only chance. If you defeat my brother, I’ll consider sparing your lives. If you die at his hands, then it’s your fate. But if my brother is harmed, you’ll share the same end as that divine clan old dog!”

Hearing this, Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian were happy but soon grim. Luotian’s conditions were too harsh—no harm to Long Jie, no loss.

But they had no choice. Facing death, their eyes flashed madness. They vanished into the sky.

“Fight!” Long Jie roared, his battle spirit surging. He rushed toward Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian.

“Let’s fight!” The two, desperate, surged forward. Though their attacks were cautious.

Suddenly, the sky above Tongtian Mountain echoed with powerful thunder. Song Yongkang and others smiled.

“Finally resolved. Tongtian Sect is safe!” Song Yongkang and other disciples gazed at Luotian, radiant like jade.

“Why are you hiding?” Luotian ignored Long Jie’s battle and gazed at the void. “Hmph, who hid? We just passed by!” A娇声 echoed.

Du Yuying and Lu Tianyu appeared in people’s sight.

“Are you here to trouble me?” Luotian’s face turned serious, smiling at Lu Tianyu.

Luotian was now a Saintly Realm. Even with control, Du Yuying and Lu Tianyu felt his pressure.

“Who’s troubling you? I said we just passed by!” Du Yuying blushed, ignoring Luotian’s aura.

“Lu Xiong, we were worried about your safety. We came to help. I didn’t expect you to ascend to the Saintly Realm so quickly! I’ll congratulate you first!” Lu Tianyu smiled bitterly, recalling Luotian’s strength during the Saintly Realm trial.

“Alas…” Luotian sighed, seeing Du Yuying pouting at him. He smiled bitterly.

Chapter 908: The Three Great Sects’ Dismay

On Tongtian Continent, thunderous sounds echoed in people’s minds. They bore reverence.

Above the sky, Long Jie radiated golden light, unafraid of two Supreme Stage equals. His dragon aura shook the heavens.

Even Lu Tianyu and Du Yuying were stunned, watching Long Jie subdue Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian. They hadn’t expected not only Luotian but also his dragon clan brother to be so powerful. Even they felt unable to suppress Long Jie.

In contrast, Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian were pitiful. Their bodies cracked, blood spilling from their mouths. They hadn’t expected Long Jie to be so strong.

“Who can harm him? Surviving against him is the real problem!” They cursed inwardly, their gazes desperate.

“Boom… boom…” Time passed. In people’s amazement, Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian collided with Tongtian Mountain, spitting blood. Their eyes held despair.

“Done!” They trembled internally. Now they had no fighting ability, their state at its worst. They were no match for Long Jie’s prime strength. Their fate was death.

Indeed, Long Jie spat out Supreme Stage energy, a golden ocean sweeping over them. Their bodies and souls were annihilated.

Blood mist scattered on Tongtian Mountain’s walls. Gu Tianzu, of course, refined it into his life essence. But it was not as effective as Sun Shengjie’s blood—only extending his life by three or four months.

Meanwhile, Luotian smiled bitterly, watching Du Yuying pouting at him. She looked ready to fight.

Logically, he had killed Ma Feiyang and Ma Tianyang—enemies of the Mountain Sea Sect. He should be Du Yuying and Lu Tianyu’s enemy. Yet he felt guilty toward this little girl, who had once lost her betrothal to him in front of the entire Fire Domain.

“Alas… who could have known I wronged her!” Luotian sighed, smiling at Lu Tianyu: “Tianyu Xiong, I’m safe now. Would you like to visit my Tongtian Mountain?”

“Alas… we came to beat you! You invite us for tea?” Du Yuying looked ready to devour Luotian.

“Hmph. Your intentions aren’t hidden. Little girl, you’re too young to think of marrying me. Look at your looks—none of my three sisters are as beautiful as you!” Long Jie, excited from defeating two Supreme Stage masters, wanted to brag. He overheard Du Yuying’s words and retorted.

Du Yuying blushed, then turned pale. Her eyes flashed anger at Long Jie: “Where’s this little brat? I’m talking to my brother. What are you doing here?”

“Hmph. Who cares if you’re older or younger? Don’t act like an adult!” Though Du Yuying was at half-step Saintly Realm, Long Jie was fearless. His gaze still held disdain.

Luotian was puzzled by Long Jie’s sudden coldness toward Du Yuying. Why did he dislike her so much?

Lu Tianyu also smiled bitterly, watching the two boys quarrel in the sky without fighting.

Song Yongkang and others were stunned. Just now, Long Jie had killed two Supreme Stage masters—now he acted like a child arguing.

“That’s the daughter of Mountain Sea Sect, Du Yuying. I once saw her from afar!” A Tongtian Sect disciple marveled at the ethereal Du Yuying.

“That’s the Supreme Heir of the Flame Domain, Lu Tianyu. I’ve seen him once!” Disciples murmured, admiring the two at Fire Domain’s peak.

People also admired Luotian and Long Jie. One made Lu Tianyu bitter; the other debated Du Yuying.

“Since you’re safe, we’ll take our leave!” Lu Tianyu, seeing Du Yuying and Long Jie quarrel, bowed to Luotian.

“Hmph. I’m not leaving… whine…” Du Yuying wanted to retort but Lu Tianyu covered her mouth, dragging her into the stars.

“Long Jie, why are you so intense toward Du Yuying?” Luotian asked, puzzled.

“Nothing!” Long Jie looked guilty. He couldn’t reveal the transmission from his three sisters when he left Tianyuan Continent.

“Long Jie, I’ll keep those shiny treasures for you. If Luotian brings back a woman, I’ll take them first!” Thinking of his treasures, Long Jie decided to prevent Luotian from meeting any woman—no matter if it was just a word.

“Hmph…” Seeing Long Jie’s reluctance, Luotian didn’t press. He thought it was just the boy being fickle. At least, it solved a problem.

He bowed three times to Tongtian Mountain, smiling as Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang approached.

“Lu…” Song Yongkang started, but his face was awkward. Luotian’s strength was too terrifying; calling him by name felt excessive.

“No problem, elder. Just call me Luotian,” Luotian smiled, nodding to everyone.

“Alright, everyone. Go do your things. The battle is over. Those who stay will be rewarded by Master Wang. You are the foundation of Tongtian Sect!” Luotian addressed the respectful disciples.

“Luotian, what about those four sects?” Wang Xuanyang hesitated. He knew everything was due to Luotian, so he felt deep gratitude. As long as Luotian remained in Fire Domain, he would be Wang Xuanyang’s benefactor—worth dying for.

“Absorb them. This way, our power should rival the three great sects. Though high-level strength still lags,” Luotian mused, whispering.

“Go on. You go do your things. With Long Jie and Song Dazhang, those four sects without Supreme Stage should be absorbed quickly. Go before other sects react and cause conflict!” Luotian ordered, gazing at the void. His lips slightly curled.

“Did they find out?” Du Hongtao, Jin Jinglong, and Lu Hanxian looked puzzled. They stood a thousand miles from Tongtian Continent, discussing via mental transmission.

“What to do? This brat entered the Saintly Realm—unforeseen. But entering the Saintly Realm is useless. What matters is whether Ancient Ancestor is still alive! We’ve never confirmed this!” Jin Jingtian’s face bore killing intent, gazing at Tongtian Continent.

They knew Luotian was hunted by sect heirs. With Mountain Sea Sect’s Grandmaster’s order, they hadn’t pursued. They only prayed their sects’ heirs wouldn’t chase Luotian.

After waiting a while, they couldn’t bear it. They had invested countless efforts to cultivate their next Grandmasters. If Luotian killed them, Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian would be heartbroken.

When Lu Tianyu transmitted the news of a divine clan saint killing Ma Tianyang and others, they finally acted. The appearance of the demon domain’s people in Fire Domain was strange. Divine clan’s arrogance usually looked down on Fire Domain and Four Sacred Star Domains. Their presence demanded attention. They decided to secretly investigate, arriving at Tongtian Continent and witnessing Luotian’s ascension and Sun Shengjie’s death.

Luotian’s ascension to Saintly Realm made them wary. A youth so young entering the Saintly Realm—especially with the method only Ancient Ancestor achieved—was too bizarre. It was enough to make the three great sects take notice. If Fire Domain produced another Ancient Ancestor, it would unify the domain—something the three great sects couldn’t allow.

“Wait. No good options now. That Tongtian Mountain is suspicious, but we can’t investigate it. Also, that sigh—was it Ancient Ancestor? We don’t know!” Lu Hanxian sighed, gazing at Tongtian Continent. He felt it was shrouded in mist.

“Hmph. We’ll have to investigate eventually. My grandson can’t die in vain!” Jin Jingtian roared like a furious dragon.

Among the three, Jin Jingtian felt most heartbroken. His grandson was his direct bloodline—trained as an heir, not a candidate.

Chapter 909: Unnoticed

After Luotian entered the Saintly Realm, events didn’t calm. His fame spread across Fire Domain like wildfire.

The Mountain Sea Sect’s marriage competition had barely ended when news of Ma Tianyang, Grandmaster Ma Feiyang, and Golden Toad Sect’s Grandmaster Jin Tianlu being killed by a divine clan saint spread. The cause was closely tied to Luotian.

Then, Luotian’s battle with a divine clan saint at the initial stage—wounding him—was reported. He was chased to Tongtian Sect, ascended to the Saintly Realm initial stage, and killed the saint. This storm swept Fire Domain, unstoppable.

Fire Domain discussed Luotian, this prodigy who emerged suddenly. At such a young age, he reached the Saintly Realm initial stage—unattainable for many in their lifetimes.

Meanwhile, Tongtian Sect used this momentum to attack Xiao Yao Dock and Feixue Dao, previously equal in power. They successfully reclaimed them, elevating Tongtian Sect’s status. It seemed to have the momentum of becoming Fire Domain’s fourth great sect.

At the same time, Tongtian Sect announced recruitment. Normally, such a big sect would attract many disciples. But Tongtian Sect was unnoticed—no one dared to join.

People watched, waiting for the three great sects’ decisions. Luotian killing sect heirs was well-known. It was the first time anyone dared to openly kill three great sects’ heirs and stay in Fire Domain. The three great sects had never been so humiliated.

People knew Tongtian Sect was at its peak. Luotian’s Saintly Realm initial stage seemed invincible, but against the three great sects’ deep roots, there was still a gap. No one wanted to join Tongtian Sect and risk their lives.

After watching for half a month, they found the three great sects remained silent. Their disciples stayed indoors as if nothing had happened.

Even so, no one dared to join Tongtian Sect. This troubled Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang, who were now telling Luotian about these events.

Luotian listened carefully, smiling. He guessed the three great sects’ situation. Their long-standing prestige was too high.

“Don’t mind. Our current power is considerable. We can maintain it!” Luotian spoke to them, gazing at the void.

“Soon someone will come looking for us!” Luotian whispered, his eyes flashing fierce battle spirit.

Hearing this, Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang smiled bitterly. They knew what Luotian meant—killing three great sects’ heirs wouldn’t be easy. But they wondered why the three great sects hadn’t attacked yet.

“The three great sects’ Grandmasters are all at the Saintly Realm initial stage. They’re not as easy to deal with as Sun Shengjie. Though I’m stronger than most Saintly Realm initial stages, even when I once overpowered the ancient Gu Tianzu at his initial stage, I’m not as strong now. I still need to learn some tactics—otherwise I might not handle it!” Luotian whispered, giving instructions before returning to his quarters.

Luotian was now the backbone of Tongtian Sect. Without him, it would have been divided long ago. His quarters were the best in Tongtian Sect.

Upon entering, he sat cross-legged on his bed, deep in thought: “Ancient Ancestor’s methods are available, but it’s better not to disturb him. I shouldn’t let Ancient Ancestor waste energy on me!”
