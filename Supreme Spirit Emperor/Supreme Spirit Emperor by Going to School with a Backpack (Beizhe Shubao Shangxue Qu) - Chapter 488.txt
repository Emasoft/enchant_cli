“Best release me, or when my brothers find out, they’ll definitely attack your Heavenly Dragon Sect. You’ll be in a world of trouble then!” Sun Kainian shouted, cursing and swearing, as if he held the Heavenly Dragon Sect in no regard.

“Do you know who I am? Do you recognize this token?” Sun Kainian shouted, swaying his corpulent body while a token radiating white light swung constantly at his waist.

“What is this?” Hearing Sun Kainian’s curses, Li Changfeng and several elders turned their gazes to the token at Sun Kainian’s waist.

“This is a token of Xinghe Academy students!” Soon, people recognized the token at Sun Kainian’s waist, their expressions shifting slightly.

“Recognized it? If you’re wise, release me. Don’t regret it later!” Sun Kainian shouted again, his voice laced with triumph—he had just thought of this token.

“Hmph. Who knows where you stole this token? We’ll send you to Xinghe Academy, and there it will be confirmed!” However, Li Changfeng’s group smiled without concern.

Seeing Sun Kainian invoke Xinghe Academy, he hadn’t yet finished speaking when a massive foot slammed into his backside.

“Dare to threaten the Heavenly Dragon Sect’s Grand Master and Grand Elder? You’re desperate for death!” Luotian stood behind Sun Kainian, shouting.

“Damn it…” Sun Kainian was kicked away and dragged back by Luotian’s rope, cursing loudly.

“Alright, since everyone has arrived, let us depart. This escort must not fail. Grand Elders, who will personally accompany it?” Li Changfeng smiled and addressed the group of Grand Elders.

“Old man will go!” A senior spoke, the same as Xue Changshan’s ally, Huifeng Grand Elder, named Du Chengshi.

“I’ll also go for a stroll!” Zhang Jinghuan smiled and addressed the group, causing Luotian’s brows to furrow. Zhang Jinghuan had no good feelings toward him and had tried to kill him several times.

After Zhang Jinghuan spoke, the other Grand Elders fell silent, none volunteering to enter the Middle Heaven.

“Nobody?” Li Changfeng’s brows furrowed, puzzled by their reluctance. After all, forging ties with Middle Heaven sects would benefit them.

“Hmph. Since no one is going, old man will go then!” As the atmosphere grew awkward, a laugh echoed in their ears. A senior stepped into view.

“Xuandan!” Seeing the elder, people’s faces changed—unexpectedly, Xuandan had arrived. Xuandan hadn’t participated in sect affairs for a long time.

Yet upon hearing Xuandan’s arrival, Li Changfeng’s eyes brightened. Xuandan was a sixth-grade immortal alchemist—rare even in Middle Heaven. If Xuandan went, it would surely impress the sects of Middle Heaven.

“Haha, then trouble you, Master Xuandan!” Li Changfeng laughed loudly, gazing at Xuandan with respect.

“No trouble at all…” Xuandan smiled gently, nodding to the group before standing there.

However, with Xuandan’s arrival, everyone’s expressions changed. Their minds were filled with curiosity.

“Alright, since everything is prepared, let us depart quickly! This journey is long. Please be safe. Two months will suffice for you to return from Middle Heaven, and you’ll arrive just in time for the contest of heavenly ascension!” Li Changfeng announced loudly. Three middle-aged elders stepped forward from the crowd, the first being Li Changfeng’s disciple Ke Zhenghao, and another familiar to Luotian—Duan Chengfeng.

But this escort’s main focus was not Ke Zhenghao, but Xuandan, Zhang Jinghuan, and Du Chengshi.

“Roar…” A roar echoed. The dragon they had ridden before returned to their view.

“Alright, let’s depart!” Xuandan said no more, smiling and lifting Sun Kainian and Yu Changtian onto the dragon’s back.

Luotian and Cen Weihong also leapt into the air, landing on the dragon’s back. A disciple with an excited expression climbed onto the dragon’s back—Ruan Xinghe, Zhu Fenghuo, Zhao Ritian were dead. Naturally, another had to be found.

“Everyone, please stay alert. Safety is paramount!” Li Changfeng made some formal remarks before watching the dragon leave Heavenly Dragon Sect.

The massive dragon soared swiftly into the sky, causing a commotion in Tianlong City.

“Is Heavenly Dragon Sect escorting someone for ascension to Middle Heaven?” The people of Tianlong City murmured, this not being a secret, so many knew the news.

“Damn it, finally out. I’ve waited long enough. Need to inform them to avoid messing up the big plan!” A young man in golden robes stood up upon hearing the murmurs.

“Then why aren’t you moving? You bastard!” A purple eagle perched on the young man’s shoulder spoke in human language.

Chapter 1884: Mirage Heaven Island()

Mirage Heaven Sea, the largest sea in Lower Heaven, occupying a third of its territory. Within this vast ocean lies an island named Mirage Heaven Island.

Mirage Heaven Island, seemingly ordinary in Lower Heaven, is no larger than a mountain peak of Heavenly Dragon Sect. Yet its power is formidable—due to controlling the sole passage from Lower Heaven to Middle Heaven.

As such a vital location, Mirage Heaven Island’s strength is formidable. However, it never participates in sect battles.

Additionally, Mirage Heaven Island has another background: a branch of the Upper Heaven’s Nine Immortal Mountains—Bountiful Sky Mountain. The passage from Middle Heaven to Upper Heaven is also controlled by Mirage Heaven Island.

Nine Immortal Mountains—just their names are enough to intimidate sects in Lower and Middle Heaven.

Due to Mirage Heaven Island’s supreme status, it has become the most desired place for wandering cultivators. Yet Mirage Heaven Island never accepts anyone—those wishing to reside there must pay a certain amount of immortal spirit stones. Once inside, their safety is guaranteed regardless of status.

This has made it the best refuge for notorious villains and those evading sects’ persecution.

Yet surviving in Mirage Heaven Island is no easy task. The rent for a single dwelling alone would break most people.

The massive dragon soared through the sea and sky, heading toward a small island. On its back stood several people, their faces filled with awe.

“Front is Mirage Heaven Island. Once there, we’ll rest a day before entering Middle Heaven!” Xuandan addressed the group.

After a month of flight, Luotian and others arrived at Mirage Heaven Sea. They could now see an island standing on the sea.

“That’s Mirage Heaven Island? It doesn’t look special at all,” a young man spoke, the third-ranked genius of Heavenly Dragon Sect, Tian Hongyun.

“Don’t be deceived. Mirage Heaven Island could destroy our Heavenly Dragon Sect,” Xuandan said with admiration.

“Once we arrive on the island, be careful with your words. Though it forbids trouble, you mustn’t offend anyone,” Xuandan warned. Even he had to be cautious in Mirage Heaven Island.

“They’ve gone to Mirage Heaven Island, it seems they’re heading for Middle Heaven. What should we do?” Meanwhile, on a large ship far away from Luotian’s group, several young men stood, gazing at the dragon.

The ship was covered in arrays, concealing its presence. Even Luotian’s group hadn’t noticed it.

“Let’s follow them. Here in Lower Heaven, we can’t act directly. If we fail, we’ll be hunted by Heavenly Dragon Sect. But in Middle Heaven, it’s advantageous for us!”

“Also, Luotian is with them. He won’t let Sun Kainian be sent away!” A young man in white robes spoke.

If Luotian noticed the ship, he would recognize it as belonging to the Star River Four Thieves. The people on the ship were also very familiar to Luotian—Nan Gong Yuqing in black robes, Li Tianzhi in blue robes, Da Kuai Ren Hongzhe, the purple eagle Diao Dezhù, and Wan Lingkong.

They had long heard of Luotian but remained hidden in Tianlong City, gathering intelligence within Heavenly Dragon Sect. Upon learning that the sect had captured two ascension candidates, they guessed it was Sun Kainian. Yet they didn’t reveal themselves—they knew Luotian would never abandon Sun Kainian, waiting for the right opportunity.

“Damn it, this damned immortal world won’t let me take human form!” Diao Dezhù cursed, frustrated at his inability to transform.

“Be patient. Once your cultivation reaches True Immortal, it’ll be fine. For now, the priority is to rescue that tomb robber. I think Luotian will also find a way, and won’t act in Lower Heaven. But that tomb robber being captured—no one could have predicted it, not even that cunning bastard!” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled and spoke to the group.

“They’ve arrived at the island. Let’s follow them. We have Star River Academy students’ tokens, so we should be able to enter Middle Heaven!”

“I wonder how the others are doing. If our elders were here, it would be better!” Nan Gong Yuqing sighed softly. If their strength was sufficient, they’d have already attacked Heavenly Dragon Sect.

……

“Arrived…” Xuandan and others let the dragon return to Heavenly Dragon Sect, then leapt down onto Mirage Heaven Island’s entrance.

Mirage Heaven Island’s exterior was bustling. Two guards stood there, their faces cold and emotionless.

A senior sat lazily nearby, a table before him with scrolls of jade slips.

Outside the entrance was lively. Many people stood there, gazing into the island as if waiting for something. Some hesitated.

“Get out—no money, can’t stay here!” As Luotian’s group stopped, a shout echoed from within the entrance. Two young men escorted a thin youth out.

“Let me go, brother! Give me another day. I’ll have immortal spirit stones tomorrow! Don’t kick me out!” The thin youth shouted, but the two in blue robes ignored him, dragging the youth out and tossing him.

“Get out…” The two young men sneered before entering Mirage Heaven Island.

“Haha, a loser. Think escaping to Mirage Heaven Island makes you safe? Poor bastard, only stayed one month and couldn’t endure!” Seeing the thin youth thrown out, two figures in the crowd rushed toward him.

“I’ll fight you!” The thin youth’s eyes showed desperation, his gaze wild. He pulled out a long sword.

“Just you?” A cold-faced man wielded a sword, slicing down at the youth.

The blue blade formed a crescent moon, instantly cutting through the youth’s body. The youth was at Heaven Immortal Initial Stage, while the man was at Heaven Immortal Middle Stage—completely crushed.

“Pf…” Blood splattered, the youth was split in two. Luotian’s brow twitched.

“These people outside are either seeking revenge or couldn’t endure life in the city, hoping to rob a few fat sheep before entering,” Xuandan explained to Luotian’s group.

The people standing at the entrance seemed unaffected by the youth’s death, as if this was common in Mirage Heaven Island.

“Clean it up. Don’t delay our business!” The senior sitting there said lazily.

“Yes, sir!” The two killers immediately showed respect, wiping the ground clean and tossing the youth’s corpse into Mirage Heaven Sea.

“How many have ended up in fish bellies!” Luotian sighed, gazing at the blood-red sea.

“Let’s go,” Xuandan showed no emotion. In the immortal world, death was common—no one could guarantee they’d live to tomorrow. A clash between two True Immortals would kill many.

Xuandan led Luotian’s group down, walking toward the senior. Upon landing, they drew attention from the crowd.

“Still a big shot,” people’s faces glowed with admiration, gazing at Luotian’s group. Most of these people had little money and were expelled; they desperately needed immortal spirit stones to enter Mirage Heaven Island, as they didn’t know when their enemies would come here—like the thin youth.

“Heavenly Dragon Sect is handling matters. Strangers, move aside!” Seeing the greedy gazes, some even drew weapons. Ke Zhenghao shouted.

“Heavenly Dragon Sect?” Upon hearing Ke Zhenghao’s shout, the crowd murmured but erupted with more fervor.

“Mirage Heaven Island is the only place in Lower Heaven that doesn’t care about the Three Major Sects. Here, it’s all immortal spirit stones!”

“Of course, there’s also strength. If you kill them, then enter Mirage Heaven Island—Heavenly Dragon Sect can’t do much!” Xuandan shook his head.

“Let’s attack them. Heavenly Dragon Sect is a major sect; their wealth must be immense. It should suffice for us to stay in Mirage Heaven Island for a while!” Xuandan’s words hadn’t finished when the crowd erupted with shouts.

“Good…” Many responded, and a group of hundreds rushed forward, blocking Xuandan’s path.

“Die!” Seeing people attack them, Zhang Jinghuan sneered. Du Chengshi also smiled. Even Luotian’s group grinned.

Though the crowd numbered hundreds, only three were at Heaven Immortal Late Stage. One person like Zhang Jinghuan could sweep them all, let alone Xuandan and Du Chengshi.

“Take a break. I’ll deal with these pests; they’re a nuisance!” Zhang Jinghuan addressed Xuandan’s group before stepping toward the crowd. At the same time, his True Immortal Initial Stage aura burst out.

“True Immortal Initial Stage! He’s Heavenly Dragon Sect’s Grand Elder!” Upon sensing Zhang Jinghuan’s aura, the crowd that had wanted to kill Luotian’s group erupted in chaos.

“Apologies for disturbing the Grand Elder of Heavenly Dragon Sect. We didn’t know!” Many immediately softened.

Chapter 1885: Encounter()

“Too late…” But Zhang Jinghuan’s face showed coldness, his eyes cruel. He swung his hands, and a phantom great sword hovered above the crowd.

“Die!” Zhang Jinghuan sneered, clenching his hands. Golden sword shadows descended upon the crowd.

“Screams…” The cries echoed outside the entrance, and one strike killed dozens of people.

“Another few times!” Zhang Jinghuan spoke softly, lifting his sword again and slicing through the crowd.

Blood and limbs scattered. Within four strikes, Zhang Jinghuan wiped out hundreds of people.

The ground was stained with blood. Arms and legs lay scattered, while the remaining people trembled in fear, gazing at Zhang Jinghuan and Luotian’s group.

“Still want to kill us for immortal spirit stones?” Zhang Jinghuan smiled coldly, wiping blood from his hands before addressing the remaining people.

Xuandan and Du Chengshi frowned. They hadn’t expected Zhang Jinghuan to be so ruthless. According to Xuandan, a display of cultivation would have sufficed.

“This Zhang Jinghuan exudes an evil aura,” Luotian thought. He hadn’t noticed it before, but this strike revealed Zhang Jinghuan’s abnormality.

Evil aura—Luotian had seen many, including those who loved to kill. But Zhang Jinghuan’s strike revealed his thirst for blood.

The remaining people were completely obedient, keeping their distance and gazing at Zhang Jinghuan with fear.

“This is True Immortal power. It’s far stronger than immortal spirit stones!” Cen Weihong said with admiration, sighing softly.

“Clean it up!” The senior at the entrance frowned slightly, glancing at Zhang Jinghuan before returning to normal. He addressed Zhang Jinghuan.

“Alright!” Zhang Jinghuan smiled, raising his hand. The sea surged, forming a water dragon that swept across the ground, carrying limbs and bodies back to Mirage Heaven Sea.

“Let’s go!” Xuandan spoke softly, leading Luotian and others to the senior’s table with a gentle smile.

“Hello. We wish to settle in Mirage Heaven Island,” Xuandan’s politeness made the senior slightly startled, but only for a moment.

“Settlement qualifications: one million immortal spirit stones. Accommodation rent: ten thousand per person per day,” the senior said solemnly, as if routine.

“Very expensive…” Hearing the price, Luotian’s group cursed inwardly. Though prepared, they were still shocked by Mirage Heaven Island’s high cost. Eleven people staying for a day would cost one hundred and ten thousand immortal spirit stones.

“Understood. Thank you!” Xuandan nodded, waving his hand to send a storage bag with two hundred and ten thousand immortal spirit stones to the senior.

“Hmph. Not bad. Definitely not like those poor bastards!” The senior nodded, then wrote.

“Name down. I’ll record it so you can enter the island!” The senior took a jade slip and addressed Xuandan.

“Master Xuandan, Master Du Chengshi, Master Zhang Jinghuan…” Xuandan recorded everyone’s names.

“Master Xuandan!” Hearing Xuandan’s name, the senior was slightly startled, gazing at him with contemplation.

“Are you Master Xuandan of Heavenly Dragon Sect?” The senior asked, then gazed at Xuandan.

“Correct. I am Master Xuandan,” Xuandan nodded. He wasn’t surprised that they recognized him.

“Ah, Master Xuandan! My apologies!” The senior said, then handed over the group’s tokens.

“This token is your credential in Mirage Heaven Island. It also records your stay duration. If you wish to recharge, go directly to the central island where there’s a dedicated recharging place. Master Xuandan, being a sixth-grade immortal alchemist, I’ve decided to grant you two days’ stay!” The senior pointed, and the tokens bore a mark indicating two days.

“Thank you,” Xuandan smiled. He hadn’t owed the senior any favor, but instead had made the senior owe him one.

“We’ll go,” Xuandan bowed and led Luotian’s group toward the entrance.

“Buzz…” As Luotian’s group hadn’t yet stepped through the gate, a buzzing sound echoed from Mirage Heaven Sea. A warship cut through the waves and appeared in their view.

“Let’s go,” Xuandan ignored the ship and stepped into the city gate.

“That ship? It seems familiar…” Luotian frowned slightly. But the distance was too far, and the ship’s presence was masked by arrays—its true form couldn’t be seen. Luotian didn’t dwell on it, stepping into Mirage Heaven Island.

Following the map’s guidance, Luotian’s group quickly arrived at a courtyard. The place was extremely simple, comparable to Xuandan’s initial accommodation.

“Three rooms total. Master Xuandan and Master Du Chengshi will stay in one, the three middle-aged in another, and the three others in the last,” Xuandan smiled and addressed Luotian’s group.

“What about these two?” Luotian gazed at Sun Kainian and Yu Changtian, hoping they’d stay with them. That way, if he accidentally let Sun Kainian go, even Xuandan couldn’t act against them in Mirage Heaven Island.

Luotian quickly formulated a plan to rescue Sun Kainian. This was the simplest and most secure method—before, he hadn’t known such a place existed.

As for whether Sun Kainian and Yu Changtian could survive in Mirage Heaven Island, Luotian wasn’t concerned. Sun Kainian’s abilities would allow him to live under any conditions, and Luotian had many pills that could sustain them for a while.

The more he thought, the brighter Luotian’s eyes became. He gazed at Sun Kainian, who also looked at him—mutual understanding formed between them. Luotian knew Sun Kainian had also thought of it.

“Never mind, let’s put them with us. These two are troublemakers; they’ve caused enough chaos in Heavenly Dragon Sect!” Zhang Jinghuan kicked Sun Kainian’s backside and addressed Luotian.

“Ugh…” Sun Kainian turned red, his mouth sealed. He nearly cried, regretting his actions in Heavenly Dragon Sect. If Luotian had seen him, he could have easily escaped.

“Son of a bitch!” Luotian glared at Sun Kainian, then gazed at Xuandan: “Why trouble the three Grand Elders? These two losers are ours. It would be bad for the elders’ peace!”

“No need. Are you questioning my orders? Go to your room!” Zhang Jinghuan frowned and scolded.

“Old bastard!” Luotian mentally cursed but kept a respectful face. He knew Xuandan was on his side, but Du Chengshi wasn’t necessarily. So he couldn’t afford to break the face.

“Haha, you young people can go explore. Mirage Heaven Island has many good things!” Xuandan gave Luotian a meaningful glance and nodded, but Luotian noticed the hidden killing intent in Xuandan’s eyes.

Luotian was Xuandan’s younger brother. Zhang Jinghuan had repeatedly tried to kill Luotian, which had made Xuandan consider killing him. Now, Zhang Jinghuan’s harsh words had nearly caused Xuandan to flip the table if Du Chengshi hadn’t been there.

“Yes…” Luotian sighed, gazing at Sun Kainian and Yu Changtian before nodding to Cen Weihong and stepping out.

Ke Zhenghao, Duan Chengfeng, and three others also stepped out of their rooms toward another.

“Cen Senior, should we go out for a walk? After spending so much money, it’s a waste if we don’t!” Seeing the elders leave, Tian Hongyun became lively, smiling and addressing Luotian and Cen Weihong.

Cen Weihong gazed at Luotian. After seeing Luotian’s barely perceptible nod, he coldly said: “Let’s go…”

Cen Weihong stepped out of the dilapidated courtyard. The three walked along a wide road, where many people were present. Luotian’s group stood out as unremarkable—those who dared to stay in Mirage Heaven Island weren’t simple.

“This Mirage Heaven Island, how much immortal spirit stones can it earn daily?” Tian Hongyun sighed, gazing at the hurried people.

Chapter 1886: Power()

“It’s quite a lot of immortal spirit stones. I’ve never seen such a profitable force!” Luotian sighed, imagining the wealth of Mirage Heaven Sea must be terrifying.

“Did you hear? Today’s newcomers are quite formidable. A Grand Elder from Heavenly Dragon Sect arrived and immediately killed two to three hundred people outside the city!”

“Another group is also formidable. A few young men killed others who cried for help!” As the three walked, murmurs echoed in people’s ears, making Luotian curious.

“Was it that warship?” Luotian muttered softly. He felt a familiar aura from the ship.

“Certainly, they’re here for the Mirage Heaven Auction. I heard this auction has brought out many good items, attracting various forces—some from Middle Heaven even came down!” People murmured, their faces showing admiration.

“Alas, we poor bastards can’t go. I just hope to stay a bit longer so my enemies don’t chase me!” People’s murmurs led them toward the island’s center. Though they couldn’t buy anything, watching the commotion was acceptable.

“Cen Senior, should we go check it out?” Tian Hongyun’s eyes lit up upon hearing about the auction and addressed Cen Weihong.

Cen Weihong frowned slightly, feeling Tian Hongyun was overstepping. He hadn’t agreed to anything but now felt he had to.

“Let’s go back first and get some immortal spirit stones from the elders. Maybe we can bid on something good for them, gaining some benefits!” Luotian smiled slightly, curious about the Mirage Heaven Auction’s level. After all, with Mirage Heaven Island’s wealth, it must be top-tier.

Cen Weihong stiffly nodded. If not for Luotian, he wouldn’t have bothered with Tian Hongyun.

After finishing their conversation, they turned back toward their accommodation. As they turned, Luotian and Cen Weihong suddenly turned around, scanning the crowd.

“Two seniors? What’s wrong?” Tian Hongyun asked with confusion.

“Nothing. Let’s go!” Luotian shook his head slightly. In the past, he had felt a familiar aura and sensed someone watching them.

Luotian exchanged glances with Cen Weihong, both silently alert. Though Mirage Heaven City forbade combat, being watched was uncomfortable.

“You bastard, I didn’t expect Luotian to notice me. Need to find a way to contact him alone!” In a corner, the purple eagle muttered.

“Buzz…” As Diao Dezhù was about to leave, a buzzing sound rose from above his head. A golden net fell, instantly covering Diao Dezhù’s body.

“This purple eagle is good. It’ll fetch a high price at the auction!” A young man smiled, grabbing Diao Dezhù.

“Damn it, who are you?” Diao Dezhù glowed with purple light and shouted.

“Crack…” The next moment, the golden net cracked open. The young man’s face shifted slightly.

“Even escaped my capture net! This beast has some skills!” The young man looked at Diao Dezhù with surprise.

“You dare to capture my grandfather? You’re desperate for death!” Diao Dezhù bared his teeth, eyes filled with ferocity. His body radiated a fierce aura.

“Though not an imperial beast, it’s still rare!”

“Eagle, follow me. I’ll ensure you fly high and dominate Middle Heaven!” The young man addressed Diao Dezhù, speaking loudly.

“Follow you? You bastard! Give me a break, don’t waste my time!” Diao Dezhù cursed and darted after Luotian.

“You insult me? You dare to insult me?”

“Zhang Bo, catch this thing!” The young man shouted. A black figure appeared behind him silently.

“True Immortal!” Diao Dezhù barely escaped, gasping. He hadn’t expected to meet a True Immortal so easily.

“Damn it, is True Immortal power so common here in Mirage Heaven City?” Diao Dezhù mentally cursed, but his speed was at maximum. His body transformed into a purple flash and vanished.

“Boom…” A black hand slammed onto the ground almost instantly, cracking it.

“Who dares to cause trouble in Mirage Heaven City!” A thunderous sound drew the attention of island guards, who appeared before the young man and black-robed elder.

“Apologies. I saw a pet and wanted to catch it, damaging the road. I’ll pay for it!” The young man smiled immediately upon seeing the guards. Though his faction was strong, it paled in comparison to Bountiful Sky Mountain behind Mirage Heaven Island.

“Hmph. Alright, remember not to cause trouble. If you do, there’s no good outcome—lighter cases will be expelled from Mirage Heaven Island, heavier ones directly killed!” The guard took the storage bag and his eyes brightened slightly.

“Don’t worry, brother. I won’t trouble you. I’ll stay here for a while. Please take care of me, brother. I Huang Youshan like making friends. If you have any difficulties, just come to me. I can’t help with everything, but I do have some immortal spirit stones!” Huang Youshan smiled.

“Haha, if you need anything in the future, just find me!” The guard leader’s eyes lit up and took the storage bag.

“Then I’ll go retrieve my pet. Brother won’t stop me, right? After all, it’s just an animal!” Huang Youshan smiled.

“Hmph. Go ahead, but don’t cause too much trouble!” The guard nodded and led people away.

On the other side, Luotian and Cen Weihong returned to their accommodation. Upon entering, the three were stunned—his dilapidated courtyard was surrounded by people, all with flattery on their faces.

“You guys go back. We won’t interfere with your matters!” Ke Zhenghao, Duan Chengfeng, and another elder stood at the courtyard’s gate, blocking people outside.

“We just want to meet Master Xuandan. Please help us!” A middle-aged man smiled, handing a storage bag to Ke Zhenghao.

“What’s going on with these people?” Cen Weihong frowned, puzzled by the crowd.

“I’ve prepared some modest gifts for Master Xuandan. I hope he’ll accept them!”

“Yes, I also brought many good things. I hope Master Xuandan will accept them!” The murmurs continued.

“Because of life, most people here came to escape their enemies. But everyone knows that living in Mirage Heaven Island isn’t permanent. To leave, they need to find someone or a sect to protect them. Heavenly Dragon Sect is the only choice!” Luotian muttered.

Luotian gazed at these people, his face thoughtful. Their auras were strong—stronger than their peers.

“If used properly, they could be a force,” Luotian thought. His greatest weakness was being alone.

Thinking this, he mentally communicated with Xuandan, who sat inside. Xuandan was slightly startled and chuckled.

“This kid really does find me trouble!” Xuandan smiled, stepping out of the room and appearing before the crowd.

“Is this Master Xuandan? Indeed a master!”

“Master Xuandan, I have ten thousand years of snow ginseng as a token. Please accept it!” Upon Xuandan’s appearance, people erupted in excitement, flattery and compliments echoing.

“Everyone, I can accept your gifts. I know your intentions. I’ll write a letter. Take it to Heavenly Dragon Sect’s Tianlong City. Once there, no one will dare touch you!”

“But the journey back is your test. If you can reach Tianlong City, from now on, you’ll be under Heavenly Dragon Sect’s protection. Consider it carefully. Once decided, give the gifts to these three; they’ll record it!” Xuandan addressed the crowd.
