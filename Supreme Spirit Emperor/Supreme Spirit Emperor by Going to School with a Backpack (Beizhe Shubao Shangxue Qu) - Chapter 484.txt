At first, Luo Tian had seen Zhang Daotian's early years, having witnessed the young Zhang Daotian who was identical to the statue.

However, Luo Tian was uncertain of the relationship between Xuan Dan and Zhang Daotian. If Xuan Dan were Zhang Daotian's enemy, then Luo Tian would have to sacrifice his life today!

"Ha ha, well then!" Xuan Dan's face remained smiling. He turned to look at Cen Hongwei and spoke softly: "In fact, I also have a sect. However, my sect was destroyed!"

"If you become my disciple, naturally you would be a sect member. You would inevitably bear an immense blood feud. Would you still wish to become my disciple?" Xuan Dan spoke again, his gaze fixed on Cen Hongwei.

"I carry too much burden, but it's nothing major. My life belongs to my master; I am willing to bear the deep grudge of my master!" Cen Hongwei's face showed determination.

"Good, it was not in vain that I saved you back then!" Xuan Dan laughed heartily, his eyes filled with satisfaction.

"This is our sect leader! Also my master in the art of elixirs. His name is Zhang Daotian. Our sect is the Heavenly Dao Sect of the Upper Three Heavens!" Xuan Dan addressed Cen Hongwei.

"Ten Thousand Dao Sect!" Upon hearing Xuan Dan's words, both Cen Hongwei and Luo Tian trembled violently. Their eyes reflected disbelief.

One of the Nine Immortal Mountains in the Upper Three Heavens, the Heavenly Dao Mountain was well-known. Though the incident had passed long ago, every sect in the Immortal Realm kept records of it.

"Th... The Heavenly Dao Sect..." Cen Hongwei's eyes reflected disbelief, never expecting Xuan Dan to possess such a status.

"Yes, this is our sect leader Zhang Daotian, the direct disciple of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King!" Xuan Dan smiled and addressed Cen Hongwei and Luo Tian, observing Luo Tian's expression.

"Is this true or false?" Luo Tian immediately became alert, fearing Xuan Dan's demeanor was a ploy to extract his words.

"Thousand Pages Brushing Technique?" Luo Tian instantly recalled his own alchemical techniques, perhaps Xuan Dan had recognized them.

"Back then, my situation was similar to yours. Fortunately, the sect leader saved me and personally avenged my great grudge! The sect leader taught me elixir arts, but he didn't send me to the Heavenly Dao Sect. Instead, he left me in the Lower Three Heavens. At that time, I was merely a worm at the Heavenly Dao stage!"

"It's because of this that I narrowly escaped disaster!" Xuan Dan's face bore a nostalgic expression as he spoke to Cen Hongwei and Luo Tian.

"Kneel down and pay homage to the sect leader!" Xuan Dan did not wait for Cen Hongwei's response and spoke again.

"Reverence to the sect leader!" Cen Hongwei bowed with reverence toward Zhang Daotian.

"Good, from now on, you are a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect!" Xuan Dan smiled slightly and turned to Luo Tian.

"Old Xuan, what are you up to?" Seeing Xuan Dan's playful gaze, Luo Tian shivered.

"Where did you get the Thousand Pages Brushing Technique?"

"Be careful, if your answer doesn't satisfy me, you won't leave today!" Xuan Dan spoke coldly.

Cen Hongwei stood up and blocked Luo Tian's path, though he knew with Xuan Dan present, Luo Tian could not escape. Yet Cen Hongwei still blocked his way.

The Heavenly Dao Sect was a taboo entity in the Immortal Realm, and this matter was significant. It was natural for Xuan Dan to kill Luo Tian.

"Old Xuan, you are Zhang Daotian's disciple. Do you have proof?" Luo Tian remained calm; after all, the situation had reached this point. He directly asked, if Xuan Dan intended to kill him, he would have done so already.

"Buzz..." Xuan Dan said nothing; illusory hand shadows continuously appeared around him, causing Luo Tian's eyes to widen in surprise.

"Enough?" The hand shadows dispersed, and Xuan Dan smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Enough..." Luo Tian's eyes showed joy, looking at Xuan Dan. At this moment, he confirmed that Xuan Dan's words were true; the technique Xuan Dan had just performed was indeed the Thousand Pages Brushing Technique.

"If it were about seniority, I might have to call you my elder brother..." Luo Tian smiled and addressed Xuan Dan.

"Indeed!"

"Where is your master?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Xuan Dan's eyes immediately became excited, his entire old body trembling.

"I don't know; I can only say he has entered the Immortal Realm!" Luo Tian softly replied, shaking his head. He truly didn't know where Zhang Daotian was.

"He's still alive! My master isn't that easy to die! Ha ha!" Xuan Dan laughed heartily, tears streaming down his face. His laughter shook Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei's ears.

"Emotionally genuine!" Seeing Xuan Dan's state, Luo Tian confirmed in his heart that Xuan Dan was not lying.

Cen Hongwei stared at Xuan Dan in disbelief; he had never seen Xuan Dan display such an expression before. If the disciples of the Tianmen Sect saw this, they would be shocked to their core.

"Junior Brother! I was right; when I saw you perform the Thousand Pages Brushing Technique, I knew you were definitely my master's disciple. Because in elixir arts, there are certain aspects where you even surpass me. Only such a genius could be worthy of being my master's disciple!" Xuan Dan's face showed tenderness, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Reverence to my elder brother!" Luo Tian had not expected Xuan Dan to be one of Zhang Daotian's disciples. He sighed inwardly, thinking that Zhang Daotian had truly been boastful back then, taking disciples so young.

But thinking about having Xuan Dan as a powerful ally behind him, Luo Tian felt great relief. At least he no longer feared Xue Changshan's betrayal.

"Junior Brother, can you tell me how your master took you in?" Xuan Dan stopped laughing and addressed Luo Tian again.

"This..." Luo Tian glanced at Cen Hongwei, his eyes showing hesitation. Although Xuan Dan had gained Luo Tian's trust, Cen Hongwei had not yet.

"Yi, come and pay homage to your uncle!" Xuan Dan addressed Cen Hongwei, sensing Luo Tian's concerns.

"This..." Cen Hongwei was disoriented; he had previously harbored hostility toward Luo Tian, but now he had to show respect to him. This was difficult for Cen Hongwei to accept.

Luo Tian folded his arms, gazing at Cen Hongwei, wanting to see what Cen Hongwei would do. It was also a test of Cen Hongwei's character.

"Reverence to my uncle!" Cen Hongwei's face turned red, his eyes filled with reluctance as he bowed to Luo Tian.

"Go away!" Luo Tian waved his hand, laughing lightly. He noticed Cen Hongwei's resentment; with such a mindset, he would not trust him.

"Master..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Cen Hongwei's face slightly changed, gazing at Xuan Dan.

"Listen to your uncle's words; I'll teach you when the time comes!" Xuan Dan was no fool. He clearly saw Cen Hongwei's resentment and lightly scolded him.

"Yes..." Cen Hongwei nodded, naturally respecting Xuan Dan's words.

"Junior Brother, is it enough?" Seeing Cen Hongwei leave, Xuan Dan retrieved Zhang Daotian's stone statue and addressed Luo Tian.

"This is a long story..." Luo Tian did not hide much, recounting everything he knew.

"I scoured the Lower Three Heavens and even reached the Middle Three Heavens but couldn't find my master. I never expected he had fallen into the Three Thousand Worlds!" Xuan Dan, upon hearing Luo Tian's account, showed realization.

"Ah! That explains why your elixir arts are so accomplished. You've lived that long!" Xuan Dan's face also showed understanding.

"Unfortunately, our Heavenly Dao Sect has perished. Rebuilding it is as difficult as climbing a mountain!" Xuan Dan sighed deeply.

"Take it slow, anything is possible. Without effort, how can you know it's impossible?" Luo Tian's face showed determination. In the Nine Domains, he had become the epoch master suppressing nine heavens and ten earths. Luo Tian was confident he could reach the peak of the Immortal Realm here as well.

Seeing Luo Tian's expression, Xuan Dan was momentarily stunned, as if seeing Zhang Daotian from back then—equally spirited.

"If I had a thousand years, I would definitely storm the Eternal Life Mountain!" Zhang Daotian's bold words echoed in his ears.

"I understand now, why your master took you as a disciple!" Xuan Dan's face showed a bitter smile. Though his current strength dwarfed Luo Tian, he had to admit that Luo Tian bore Zhang Daotian's mark.

"Junior Brother, from today on, I will do my best to help you grow. I know my talent might only reach the peak of True Immortal Stage!"

"But you are different. Your talent is excellent; perhaps you can achieve the position of Immortal King. Then our revenge will be possible!" Xuan Dan's face showed hope.

"Senior Brother, first help me solve this current problem!" Luo Tian shook his head with a bitter smile, recounting his situation. This included Chen Zhanbiao, Sun Kemin, and the restriction placed within Guan Hongsheng's body.

"Guang Hongsheng, how bold of him!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Xuan Dan's face darkened.

"Junior Brother, I'll gather people now and storm the Chaos Heaven Sect, destroying their mountain!" Xuan Dan spoke loudly, about to retrieve his token and contact people. However, Luo Tian stopped him with a hand.

"Senior Brother, dear senior brother, if you take people to destroy the Chaos Heaven Sect, what about me? If Guan Hongsheng panics and takes away my cultivation, what then?" Luo Tian's face showed a bitter smile.

"Right... I was impulsive!" Xuan Dan paused, then shook his head. He placed his hand on Luo Tian's body and began examining his condition.

"Dao Heart Seeding!" Soon after, Xuan Dan opened his eyes, his gaze filled with shock. He looked at Luo Tian and spoke in disbelief.

Chapter 1870: Entering the Harmonious Peak ()

"Do you know what this is?" Luo Tian's face showed joy, gazing at Xuan Dan. If he knew what it was, that was good; otherwise, there would be no direction at all.

"I can only guess, since the Dao Heart Seeding technique has not appeared for many years!" Xuan Dan's face showed bitterness.

"The one who planted the seed becomes another's nourishment, ultimately becoming their wedding dress!" Xuan Dan spoke again.

"A thousand years ago, the Middle Three Heavens had a Mind Demon Elder who specialized in Dao Heart Seeding. Originally, the Mind Demon Elder's talent was ordinary, but he grew to become a True Immortal Peak powerhouse through this technique!"

"However, this technique is extremely evil and not tolerated by cultivators. Therefore, the Heavenly Mechanism Immortal King sent a manifestation to destroy this Mind Demon Elder. From then on, the Dao Heart Seeding technique was completely lost!" Xuan Dan spoke softly.

"Is there any way to break it?" Upon hearing Xuan Dan's explanation, Luo Tian felt a shiver; this technique was not simple.

"There is none. No one has heard of anyone breaking it. Only the practitioner can break it! Perhaps with an Immortal King's methods, it could be cured!" Xuan Dan gazed at Luo Tian.

"Damn it..." Luo Tian cursed inwardly, never expecting this restriction to be so difficult to solve.

"Sigh..." Xuan Dan also sighed deeply, never expecting Luo Tian to have been ensnared by such a restriction. Xuan Dan was also at a loss.

"Don't worry, when the mountain comes, there will be a path. I've braved many storms and waves; I won't fail now!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, comforting himself.

"Senior Brother, can you solve my friend's problem?" Luo Tian waved his hand and released Chen Zhanbiao, intending to let Xuan Dan see.

"Chaos Heaven Sect is indeed cruel!" Xuan Dan saw Chen Zhanbiao's condition, sensing the chaotic blood energy within him. He sighed softly.

"I'll try; I'll keep him here, but it will take time!"

"Also, I should greet the other senior elders. Let you have an easier time in Tianmen Sect from now on!" Xuan Dan spoke again, his voice filled with concern.

Both were disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect; obviously, they were now on the same side. Although Luo Tian was only at the initial stage of Immortal, Xuan Dan knew his future achievements would surpass his own.

"No need; I think our current relationship is good enough. One in the open, one in the shadows—uncover all potential enemies and destroy them. Ideally, find your master. However, after this long time, my name is known throughout the Lower Three Heavens, but no one has come. I suspect those who ascended with me are not in the Lower Three Heavens!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, forming another plan. At present, he was completely safe in the Tianmen Sect; it was time to plan for the future.

"Ah, good. Let Hongwei follow you; he should be trustworthy!" Xuan Dan's face showed a slight smile.

"This kid doesn't trust me at all," Luo Tian shook his head lightly. Cen Hongwei's strength was indeed good, but Luo Tian could sense his character.

"He is also a tragic person; his personality has flaws, not trusting anyone. This relates to his past experiences," Xuan Dan sighed softly.

"Let me listen!" Luo Tian's face showed interest; he could also sense that Cen Hongwei had a story.

"Back then, I found him in a graveyard of corpses. He was barely alive, covered with wounds; even his right leg had been devoured by worms! If I had found him half a day later, he would have died!"

"The situation was so grim that even I felt cold. Everywhere were corpses; he lay there, with a large part of his body rotten!"

"After saving him, he spoke little. He never mentioned his past. Only after becoming familiar did he tell me about his background."

"Cen Hongwei's parents were originally sect disciples. His birth was an accident; they despised him, rarely caring for his life. When he faced bullying outside, they beat and scolded him."

"However, Hongwei's talent was good. As he grew up, he showed promise. But in the end, he was betrayed by his only friend, who stripped him of his cultivation and cast him into the secular world's army. He ended up in such a state..." Xuan Dan spoke softly, though it was plain.

"More tragic than me..." Luo Tian felt Cen Hongwei's suffering upon hearing Xuan Dan's description.

"Parents didn't care, brothers betrayed and framed him, cast into the secular world..." Xuan Dan's account was simple, but Luo Tian could imagine what Cen Hongwei had endured.

"This kid's current personality is distrustful of everyone, even me, only showing gratitude!"

"If you can win his loyalty, it would be a great help for you," Xuan Dan's face showed depth as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Never mind, I don't have the time!" Although Luo Tian sympathized with Cen Hongwei's fate, it didn't mean he would help him. Such a person needed years of gradual transformation; Luo Tian had no spare time for that.

"Then let him follow you. After all, he's my disciple; watch over him. If he has any ulterior motives, you have full authority to deal with it!" Xuan Dan spoke again, giving Luo Tian an impossible condition.

"Ah, I'll go back first; I'm joining the Harmonious Peak. Senior Brother, if you have anything to say, find me at the Harmonious Peak!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Xuan Dan and then stepped out of the courtyard.

"Ah..." As Luo Tian exited the courtyard, he sighed deeply, feeling the压抑 pressure in his heart eased. After all, he no longer had to fight alone. In the Lower Three Heavens, Xuan Dan's strength was undoubtedly among the top; he could fully protect Luo Tian. Plus, with Xuan Dan's elixir arts, no one in the Lower Three Heavens dared to offend Xuan Dan.

"Struggle for Heaven's Battle!" Luo Tian muttered lowly, now considering the Struggle for Heaven's Battle. That was the main issue; only reaching the Middle Three Heavens could Luo Tian cultivate faster, and strength was the hard truth.

With the elixir competition concluded, the Elixir Peak returned to calmness. Luo Tian walked along the road; the Elixir Peak disciples no longer looked down on him with mockery but instead showed reverence. Although Xuan Dan hadn't taken Luo Tian as a disciple, his name had now become renowned throughout the Tianmen Sect—not because of his strength but due to his elixir arts.

Luo Tian walked slowly, arriving at the foot of the Harmonious Peak. Though it had more people than before, it still lagged far behind the other peaks.

"See what your attitude is; if you don't scheme against me, we'll get along. If you do scheme against me, don't blame my retaliation!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, then smiled and stepped through the gate.

"Senior Brother Luo Tian!" As Luo Tian entered the gate, two sentry disciples immediately gasped. Who in the Tianmen Sect didn't know Luo Tian? They had just discussed today's elixir competition, but now they met the real thing.

"Please inform the Left Peak Leader; Luo Tian wishes to join the Harmonious Peak!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed the two disciples.

"Good... good..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the two disciples' faces showed joy. They rushed up to the peak.

"Luo Tian has arrived... Luo Tian has arrived..." Soon, the entire Harmonious Peak echoed with noise. A group of figures descended from the mountain, their faces filled with confusion—why had Luo Tian suddenly come to the Harmonious Peak?

"Luo Senior Brother!" From among the crowd, a figure stepped forward, his face filled with joy—YU Haonan, who had once been broken by Luo Tian.

"Brother!" As Yu Haonan stepped out, a pretty figure also jumped from the crowd, her face filled with joy.

"Yuyan, why are you here?" Luo Tian greeted Yu Haonan and then looked at the girl rushing toward him.

"Master Left brought me in! Since Brother will join the Harmonious Peak, I came too!" Long Yuyan spoke loudly. Seeing the respectful expressions of those around him toward Luo Tian, she looked unusually satisfied.

Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, his gaze deep as he watched the two descending from the mountain—Zuo Qiu Ming and Xue Yushan. He seemed to understand why Zuo Qiu Ming had brought Long Yuyan into the Harmonious Peak.

"Haha, brother, I heard you dominated in the Elixir Peak! Now who doesn't know about you, Luo Tian? Haha!" Zuo Qiu Ming's face showed joy as he descended with Xue Yushan, like a divine couple.

The stronger Luo Tian was, the better it was for Zuo Qiu Ming. Especially with elixir arts, Zuo Qiu Ming knew that a renowned elixir master would definitely bring much popularity to the Harmonious Peak.

"Big Brother, I'll follow you from now on!" Luo Tian smiled, as Zuo Qiu Ming had treated him well.

"Rest assured; although you are a disciple of the Harmonious Peak, your treatment is equal to that of a senior. Except for me and my wife, you can command anyone!" Zuo Qiu Ming directly delegated authority.

"Haha, come on, let's go have a drink with Big Brother!" Zuo Qiu Ming grabbed Luo Tian's hand and flew into the air amidst the gazes of the Harmonious Peak disciples.

"From today on, Luo Tian is our great elder of the Harmonious Peak? Then we can certainly make elixirs more conveniently!"

"Listen, Luo Senior Brother is a four-star elixir master! His elixir arts amazed even Master Xuan Dan!" The disciples of the Harmonious Peak whispered among themselves.

Soon, news of Luo Tian joining the Harmonious Peak spread throughout the Tianmen Sect, but it only caused people to gossip.

"Any disciple joining the Harmonious Peak must pay a one percent fee for my elixirs!" However, after Luo Tian issued this message, it caused a stir.

Chapter 1871: Duan Chengfeng's Return ()

Elixir masters charging fees was common. Just like when Luo Tian had previously used the alias "Luo Dan," one elixir required eight times the herbs, a fee that was terrifying. Luo Tian's one percent fee could make anyone consider it, especially since he had already demonstrated his strength in the elixir competition.

This message spread quickly, and more people wanted to join the Harmonious Peak from the outer sect. Each day, about twenty to thirty people came.

During Luo Tian's absence from the Tianmen Sect, the Harmonious Peak had also undergone changes. When he left, the entire peak had only over a hundred people; now it had grown to nearly ten thousand. However, compared to other peaks with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, it was still insignificant.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian had been in the Harmonious Peak for seven days, bringing many disciples with his popularity.

In a quiet courtyard, Zuo Qiu Ming smiled and told Luo Tian about the recruitment situation over these days.

"Brother, your fame is truly high! I've gained about half of the ten thousand disciples from the Earth Peak. Since you arrived, we've added hundreds more!" Zuo Qiu Ming spoke softly. Although only twenty to thirty people came daily, it was much better than before.

"Twenty or thirty people aren't enough! Peak Leader, please spread the word: I am Luo Tian!" Luo Tian addressed Zuo Qiu Ming.

Luo Tian's name was famous, but the outer sect disciples hadn't tasted his elixirs. However, "Luo Dan" was different; the original Luo Dan had been a master in the eyes of all outer sect disciples. Luo Tian knew that "Luo Dan" was more useful than his name in the outer sect.

"Master Luo Dan! Brother, you truly kept it hidden deep!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Zuo Qiu Ming's face slightly changed before patting Luo Tian's shoulder and laughing.

"Brother, you truly kept it hidden deep! But this identity is more useful than your Luo Tian identity!" Zuo Qiu Ming laughed and then took out his identification token to send a message.

"Big Brother, how do you plan to become the sect leader?" Luo Tian spoke softly; he was more concerned about how Zuo Qiu Ming would become the sect leader, helping him fully settle his debt to Zuo Qiu Ming and Xue Changfeng's care for him in the Tianmen Sect.

"It's simple; a battle among the nine peaks' leaders and disciples, with the winner becoming the sect leader!" Xue Changfeng sighed deeply. This was why he urgently wanted more disciples in the Harmonious Peak.

"Simple and brutal! It not only tests the leaders' strength but also that of each peak's disciples!" Luo Tian nodded, his gaze filled with admiration.

"However, this self-annihilation will certainly cause damage. This battle would surely weaken the Tianmen Sect!" But soon after, Luo Tian's face showed confusion.

"We have a True Dragon Secret Realm in the Tianmen Sect, capable of conjuring an illusory body with equal strength to one's own. The battle will take place there!" Zuo Qiu Ming explained to Luo Tian.

"Ah, Big Brother, I'll do my best to help you become the sect leader!" Luo Tian nodded. Zuo Qiu Ming then stood up and left, as his identification token had started to glow.

"Luo Tian is Master Luo Dan!" This news made the outer sect disciples who had been hesitant become frenzied.

Luo Tian was right; the name "Master Luo Dan" was much more useful than his name "Luo Tian." After all, most outer sect disciples had tasted Master Luo Dan's elixirs.

"Ah! So Luo Tian is Master Luo Dan!" A series of outer sect disciples who had passed the inner sect's trials chose to join the Harmonious Peak, with nearly three hundred joining on the first day alone. This made Zuo Qiu Ming overjoyed.

Within just a few days, another explosive news spread: the number one warrior of the Tianlong Battle Rankings, Xuan Dan's direct disciple Cen Hongwei, had chosen to join the Harmonious Peak!

This news stunned everyone. Why would Cen Hongwei, an official disciple of Xuan Dan, choose to join the Harmonious Peak instead?

Even more astonishing was that Xuan Dan had not questioned Cen Hongwei's decision, allowing him to develop freely.

"I also want to join the Harmonious Peak; with Cen Senior Brother and Luo Senior Brother here, the Harmonious Peak's future will surely flourish. Giving snow in a time of need is better than adding flowers to an already blooming scene!" With Cen Hongwei's joining, the outer sect disciples' enrollment in the Harmonious Peak surged again, making Zuo Qiu Ming overjoyed.

"Hongwei, smile a little! Why don't you fix that scar on your face? Originally, it was a good-looking face; now it's like this. Don't keep your face so stern!" Luo Tian addressed Cen Hongwei, who stood like an ice block.

Luo Tian's third day in the Harmonious Peak saw Cen Hongwei approach him without a word, following Luo Tian constantly.

"You're such a wooden post! Life is beautiful; but revenge isn't done this way. If you keep your face so stern, will the enemy die from fear?" Luo Tian spoke again; he knew Cen Hongwei had a grudge.

These days, Luo Tian lived leisurely, focusing on elixir making and cultivation; he didn't need to manage the Harmonious Peak's affairs, so he wasn’t concerned about guiding Cen Hongwei. As for how much he guided him, that was beyond Luo Tian's consideration.

"Senior Brother, the Peak Leader of Zai Peak wants to see you; he has already arrived at the mountain's base!" While Luo Tian was about to guide Cen Hongwei with his eloquence, a disciple of the Harmonious Peak stood outside Luo Tian's courtyard and shouted into it.

"Who?" Upon hearing the disciple's words, Luo Tian immediately jumped up, his teacup falling. His eyes showed disbelief.

Luo Tian's reaction startled the disciple greatly, and even Cen Hongwei was surprised by Luo Tian's strong reaction.

"Zai Peak's Duan... Duan Leader! He has returned!" The disciple felt Luo Tian's aura was intimidating and spoke hesitantly.

"Invite him in!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered, then he sat down slowly, his mind constantly pondering.

"Yes..." The disciple bowed and left, leaving Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei alone.

Cen Hongwei said nothing; Luo Tian sat there, lost in thought. The atmosphere of the courtyard contrasted sharply with its previous ease.

"How could it be? Guan Hongsheng, why did he let Duan Chengfeng return!" Luo Tian was puzzled; he didn't know why Guan Hongsheng had done this.

"Let's see, let's find out what Duan Chengfeng wants. If it's no good, we'll have to run!" Luo Tian muttered lowly, waiting for Duan Chengfeng's arrival.

Not long after, Duan Chengfeng arrived at Luo Tian's courtyard under the guidance of the disciple. Standing outside the gate, his gaze met Luo Tian's.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian looked at Duan Chengfeng, a wave of energy emanated from his dantian. Five black character chains slowly drifted around it.

"Ah! That's why..." As the five character chains floated, Luo Tian instantly understood; Duan Chengfeng had also been subjected to Dao Heart Seeding.

"Senior Leader, please come in!" Luo Tian smiled and stepped out of the courtyard to welcome Duan Chengfeng.

"You still have time for this!" Duan Chengfeng, seeing Luo Tian, couldn't help but mock him and stepped into the courtyard.

"Senior Leader, what's your business?" Luo Tian addressed Duan Chengfeng. Their relationship was now delicate; previously, Duan Chengfeng had wanted to kill him, and he had nearly killed Duan Chengfeng. Now both were under Dao Heart Seeding; they were fellow sufferers, with their fates in others' hands.

"Cen Hongwei, why is he here?" Duan Chengfeng's eyebrows slightly furrowed; he didn't want a third party to be present for his conversation with Luo Tian.

"Senior Leader, don't worry; Hongwei is one of us! Just say what you need to!" Luo Tian noticed Duan Chengfeng's hesitation and smiled.

"Since you don't mind, there's nothing else. I just need to confirm the details and relay a message!" Duan Chengfeng smiled lightly.

"Ah, thank you for the message! I'll tell Li Zhangpai and the senior elders!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, recounting his experience with Li Changfeng. He knew Duan Chengfeng wasn't foolish and would know how to handle it.

"Ah, I understand. He sent me a message: cultivate well; if you don't reach the True Immortal Stage within two years, he'll reap the fruits himself!" Duan Chengfeng's eyes showed bitterness as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Then I won't see you off!" Luo Tian nodded, indicating he understood, then sent Duan Chengfeng away.

"What's your problem?" Luo Tian gazed deeply at Duan Chengfeng leaving, his cold voice echoing behind him.

"Nothing; what problem could there be?" Luo Tian smiled again, confident Duan Chengfeng would handle the matter.

"By the way, Hongwei, how is the Tianlong Battle Rankings ranked?" Then Luo Tian thought of the matter of sending ascended people, wanting to first secure a top three spot on the Tianlong Battle Rankings.

On another side, in the Heavenly Peak's hall, Duan Chengfeng showed respect and recounted the events to Li Changfeng.

"It's no different from what Luo Tian said!" Li Changfeng's face slightly darkened, gazing at Duan Chengfeng.

As Duan Chengfeng finished recounting in the hall, it fell into silence. The senior elders sat there with dark faces.

"Chaos Heaven Sect is indeed bold! They dared to kill our disciples, Master, this cannot be ignored!" The peak leader of De Peak spoke up first, breaking the silence.

"It's indeed excessive. But Master, now is the time for the Struggle for Heaven's Battle; if we truly confront Chaos Heaven Sect, our losses will also be great. After all, Chaos Heaven Sect has two True Immortal Stage initiates, Fan Tianming and that Mei Gu. Their strength is not to be underestimated; defeating ten enemies while losing eight yourself!" The peak elder of Wu Peak spoke, causing the hall to fall silent again.

Chapter 1872: Deterrence of Chaos Heaven Sect ()

"This matter may damage our sect's prestige!" Xue Changshan spoke seriously, gazing at Li Changfeng.

"Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe have great prestige within the Tianmen Sect. If they die, it will also cause unrest among the disciples. A sect that cannot guarantee its disciples' safety cannot have cohesion!" The elders began arguing.

"We should go and see; this matter needs Chaos Heaven Sect to give us a satisfactory explanation!" Li Changfeng coughed lightly, finally settling the matter.

"Take along those with potential generations; it's good to broaden their horizons!" Li Changfeng's gaze showed contemplation.

On another side, on a high platform in the Heavenly Peak of Tianmen Sect, Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei stood face to face. Below the platform, a crowd gathered.

The Tianlong Battle Platform was where Tianmen Sect disciples competed and exchanged techniques. Cen Hongwei had once defeated the sect's prodigies here, becoming the number one on the Tianlong Battle Rankings.

"What's going on?" A series of inner sect disciples showed confusion, not knowing why the two stood here.

"Cen Senior Brother has joined the Harmonious Peak! Luo Tian also joined the Harmonious Peak. Both are in one peak; why are they both here?" People showed confusion.

"Cen Hongwei, you attacked me before; today is the day to settle it!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, his voice echoing around.

Luo Tian wanted to become one of those who would escort ascended people, so he needed to be in the top three of the Tianlong Battle Rankings. The simplest way was to challenge those on the rankings. Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe had both been defeated by Luo Tian, so the best choice was Cen Hongwei.

"Wow..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, people were stunned; never expected Luo Tian to immediately provoke Cen Hongwei after winning the elixir competition. He was truly not easygoing!

"Cen Hongwei, come on, let's fight three hundred rounds. Today I'll sit on the number one spot of the Tianlong Battle Rankings!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, his voice filled with arrogance, as if he didn't regard Cen Hongwei at all.

"..."

Everyone was speechless, never expecting Luo Tian to be so arrogant, not even looking at Cen Hongwei.

"Attack!" Before he finished speaking, Luo Tian had already launched an attack. His hands moved, and a golden hand flew from his hands, covering the sky and earth with powerful energy, pressing down on Cen Hongwei.

"This power is so strong!" Seeing the golden hand, people who had previously been dismissive gasped in surprise.

"I remember now; a few days ago, Luo Tian ascended the Elixir Peak and made Zhao Ritian spit blood. This shows Luo Tian's strength is at least above Zhao Ritian!" Someone spoke, recalling the incident of Luo Tian beating Zhao Ritian.

"I'm standing here; if I take a step back, it's my loss!" Cen Hongwei's cold voice echoed in people's ears, making them shiver.

Cen Hongwei stood there facing Luo Tian's powerful attack without changing expression, his body radiating waves of black energy.

"Indeed, Cen Hongwei Senior Brother is confident; he doesn't even return the attack!" People's faces showed strong joy upon hearing Cen Hongwei's cold and bold words.

"Boom..." A moment later, the golden hand pressed onto Cen Hongwei's body, leaving a massive handprint on the platform. Dust and stones flew everywhere, obscuring people's vision.

"Is Senior Brother Cen okay?" People looked at the slightly trembling platform, their mouths twitching.

"Haha! From today on, I am the number one of the Tianlong Rankings!" Luo Tian laughed heartily, taking a step forward and walking away with his hands behind his back, looking lofty. He flew toward the Harmonious Peak.

"Disgusting! One slap and he wants to win against Senior Brother Cen? Dream on! Wait until Senior Brother Cen slaps him to death!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words and seeing his arrogant demeanor, people couldn't help but mock him.

Who was Cen Hongwei? He was the god in the hearts of Tianmen Sect's young disciples, an undefeated deity. Though cold and brutal, his strength made them feel secure.
