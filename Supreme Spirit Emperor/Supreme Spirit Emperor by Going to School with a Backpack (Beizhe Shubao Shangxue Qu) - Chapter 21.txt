“Master Luo Dan, you truly speak with haste and clarity!”

People nodded in agreement. Upon hearing Luo Tian’s promise, they all felt this journey had not been in vain. Though most had come to forge an alliance with Luo Tian, for his elixirs were currently the most sought-after in the Bone-Devouring Stage, hearing him make the promise personally still filled them with joy.

When Gu Yun heard that Luo Tian could refine elixirs imbued with seven-tenths of the power of nature, his face bore a look of astonishment. He was himself an alchemist; he understood the concept of “power of nature.” His own maximum was four layers, and with good fortune and conditions, he could reach five. How long had Luo Tian been studying alchemy? Yet he already achieved seven-tenths of the power of nature!

Dong Sansi, seeing Luo Tian speak thusly, had his eyes twitch. He sighed inwardly at the magnitude of Luo Tian’s ambition. These days, having hosted Wuxing Sect disciples, he knew how many had come to assist.

Excluding others, the number of disciples from each peak who had reached the Body-Refining Stage’s eighth level totaled nearly a thousand. That meant Luo Tian would need to refine a thousand batches of elixirs—this did not even account for the Bone-Devouring Stage.

After all, few could afford to summon Bone-Devouring Stage disciples. Only those like Du Hongyu, who had just entered the stage, came to assist—approximately sixty or seventy people.

Do not underestimate these sixty or seventy individuals; they could obliterate any second-rate sect without an Astral Soul Stage guardian. Even Feiyun Sect, a top-tier sect among second-rate ones, had only forty Bone-Devouring Stage disciples in total.

When Luo Tian heard Dong Sansi’s numbers, his heart trembled. He had not expected his influence within the Wuxing Sect to be so vast.

Gu Yun and Lei Yong said nothing; they knew Luo Tian was the central figure today. Seeing his charisma so astonishing, they marveled again at the power of an alchemist’s influence.

The group drank and feasted, the atmosphere lively. Luo Tian clinked glasses with everyone, never using his cultivation to numb himself. He drank until he was senseless, then was carried off by Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. Only when people gradually dispersed did the revelry end.

Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun also drank heavily, boasting they could not defeat Luo Tian in strength but would challenge him in drinking capacity.

Everyone knew their hearts ached; they had been the most radiant figures, yet now seemed dull under Luo Tian’s brilliance. How could this not be sorrowful?

…

At dawn, before the gates of the Gu family.

“Why hasn’t Luo Tian come out yet?” Ning Qingzhu pouted, standing before the Gu family gates, complaining.

“No one asked you to!” Ji Chen coldly replied, his eyes carrying a hint of concern. Last night, Luo Tian’s state had been abnormally grim—nothing like his usual composed self. This worried him deeply.

“Little Master, he’s trained so hard for this day!” Leiyong sighed softly, recalling the past half-year. Luo Tian had seemingly never rested a day.

“The betrayal of that woman wounded him deeply!” Gu Qianxue recalled Luo Tian’s drunken words from yesterday. Her voice was icy, her eyes flashing a cold glint.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, feeling dazed and groggy. He let out a bitter laugh, then circulated his cultivation to dispel the alcohol’s fumes. Gazing at the bright sunlight outside, his eyes flashed a cold glint: “Li Xiuping. Chen Yunting. Today is the day of reckoning!”

Luo Tian adjusted his robes and stepped through the door, striding toward the Gu family gates.

As he walked slowly outside, he saw Gu Qianxue and others waiting for him. His heart warmed slightly as he approached them.

“You’ve got quite the attitude, making all of us wait!” Ning Qingzhu complained.

“Sorry for keeping you waiting!” Luo Tian smiled, knowing Ning Qingzhu’s character well. He offered a sincere apology to the group.

“Are you alright?” Gu Qianxue stepped forward, grasping Luo Tian’s hand and transmitting warmth.

“I’m fine!” Luo Tian smiled, offering her a reassuring glance.

“Luo Senior Brother, the other disciples from Wuxing Sect who came to assist have already departed for Feiyun Sect. Shouldn’t we be leaving too?” Dong Sansi whispered to Luo Tian.

“Let’s go. Let’s see my old friends! I wonder what expression they’ll have when they see this display!” Luo Tian spoke loudly. The group cultivated their energy and rushed toward Feiyun Sect.

Gu Yun, at the Body-Refining Stage’s fifth level, knew he could not contribute much. After discussing with everyone, he decided to remain at the Gu family to oversee matters.

Watching the group depart, an inexplicable sense of foreboding stirred in his heart. He sighed: “With the identity of Wuxing Sect disciples and so many Bone-Devouring Stage masters, it should not be a problem.”

Tian Bo heard Gu Yun’s words and smiled: “The Master need not worry. Luo Tian is no longer the boy who needed your protection to grow. Now they’ve all matured!”

“Yes, they have grown up! I… am old,” Gu Yun sighed, releasing his concern and turning with Tian Bo into the Gu family gates.

Chapter 97: Trampling Feiyun Sect

Chapter 97: Trampling Feiyun Sect

Feiyun Sect was renowned in the Northern Region since its founding. At its peak, it ranked among first-rate sects. However, times had changed; even the grandest sects faced decline. Over time, Feiyun Sect had gradually weakened and now occupied a mid-tier position among second-rate sects.

Yet Feiyun Sect had once been a first-rate sect of great prestige. Though it had declined, its formidable foundation still made even weaker first-rate sects hesitate to provoke it.

Today, outside Feiyun Sect’s mountain gates, an air of tension hung. The sect’s disciples and elders watched the dark mass of nearly a thousand Body-Refining Stage disciples. More alarming were the dozens of Bone-Devouring Stage masters exuding terrifying auras.

The head of Feiyun Sect’s Enforcement Hall, his face grim, watched the group outside. A hint of regret flickered across his face—unaware that a simple favor had led to this situation.

“Have they arrived? I didn’t expect you to gather such influence in half a year. This is interesting!” Li Xiuping stood in a dark cell, listening to an apprentice’s report. A light smile crossed his face.

Feiyun Sect’s elders frowned at the crowd outside, puzzled by why so many Wuxing Sect disciples had come to Feiyun Mountain. The elders exchanged glances, none understanding the situation.

“Why have you come to Feiyun Sect?” Deng Jiusi, Feiyun Sect’s Grand Elder and Li Xiuping’s master, asked with feigned ignorance.

But the answer was silence. Wuxing Sect disciples were proud and did not respond to Deng Jiusi, merely gazing coldly at Feiyun Sect’s people.

Deng Jiusi, ignored by all, felt a flicker of anger. After all, he was Feiyun Sect’s Grand Elder and had reached the Bone-Devouring Stage’s late phase. Yet no one acknowledged him. He wanted to vent his anger but knew these were Wuxing Sect disciples. Even if one was harmed, it would be a heavy burden for the Wuxing Sect.

For a moment, Deng Jiusi stood awkwardly, unsure how to proceed.

“Ha! Grand Elder, it’s been a while! Do you still remember me, Luo Tian?” A loud laugh echoed in. Luo Tian and Lei Yong’s figures appeared within sight.

As the voice rang out, people turned their gazes downward, watching the young figures swiftly ascending from below.

“Master Luo Dan! Senior Brother Luo!” The Wuxing Sect disciples greeted Luo Tian, their demeanor sharply contrasting with how they had treated Deng Jiusi.

“Luo Tian!” Deng Jiusi’s gaze sharpened, turning toward the figure.

“Who is Luo Tian?” Feiyun Sect elders murmured, trying to recall who this young man was.

“I remember now! It’s Luo Tian—the outer disciple expelled from the sect and cast out!” One elder exclaimed, his face filled with shock.

“Why was he expelled?” The elders all inquired.

“It seems due to a conflict with Li Xiuping, so…” The elder did not finish but glanced toward Deng Jiusi.

Upon hearing this, the elders understood immediately: Li Xiuping had framed him and cast him out. Yet he had joined the Wuxing Sect, apparently thriving there. Now he returned for revenge.

Feiyun Sect elders all glared at Deng Jiusi with anger. Though this was not unusual in the past, it had never been so serious before. This time, it was the Wuxing Sect! How could they manage such a massive blunder?

“Deng Jiusi, you and your disciple have created this trouble. You must resolve it yourselves!”

“Yes, we can’t afford to provoke the Wuxing Sect!” The elders all shouted at Deng Jiusi.

“Hmph! You bastards!” Deng Jiusi gritted his teeth, his eyes cold as he glared at the two who had led this. They had long been at odds with him, and now was the perfect opportunity to push him under the bus. He would not miss it.

“Luo Tian, I know we wronged you. Is there no room for compromise?” Deng Jiusi gritted his teeth and shouted at Luo Tian.

“Oh, compromise? Of course! Bring out the ones who framed me and let me kill them one by one. That’s it, right?” Luo Tian regarded Deng Jiusi with mockery.

“You! Don’t push your luck too far!” Deng Jiusi’s face flushed with anger. He had been one of those who framed Luo Tian; without his approval, the Enforcement Hall elders would not have dared to frame him so openly.

“Then there’s no talking! Let’s fight! Of course, you can call Li Xiuping out first. I remember the half-year agreement!” Luo Tian’s expression remained calm, but his eyes burned with battle intent.

“By the way, there’s Chen Yunting! I have something to ask her!” Luo Tian added.

“Xiuping is on his way back. As for Chen Yunting… you’ll have to ask Xiuping yourself!” Deng Jiusi spoke, then said nothing more.

Luo Tian heard Deng Jiusi’s words and furrowed his brows, speaking solemnly: “Fine. I’ll wait for Xiuping to arrive. I can wait, but my brothers and sisters behind me may not have the patience!”

“Hmph. Naturally!” Deng Jiusi coldly snorted and said no more.

…

In Feiyun Sect’s dungeon, Li Xiuping’s face was twisted with ferocity. His long hair flew as his eyes were filled with blood-red light. A disciple nearby, seeing his normally handsome senior now transformed into this, felt fear and trembled.

Before Li Xiuping stood an old woman with numerous wounds. Her face alternated between confusion, pain, and clarity.

Li Xiuping’s hands moved swiftly, a stream of blood-red energy emerging from his body. It formed dense red seals, which clung to the old woman’s body and seeped into her.

“Furnace of Heaven, Soul-Devouring Technique! Blood Transmutation into a Corpse!” Li Xiuping roared with ferocity.

“What kind of technique is this? It feels so evil, making my heart tremble!” The disciple nearby wondered but dared not ask.

As Li Xiuping’s words finished, the seals reappeared on the old woman’s body. Her entire form was wrapped in blood-red energy, and her wounds rapidly healed before the disciple’s eyes.

Three breaths passed, and the old woman’s wounds were fully restored. She opened her eyes; a flash of red light passed, and she vanished like a normal person—except for the lack of vitality in her eyes.

Chapter 98: Conflict

Chapter 98: Conflict

“Haha, old man, you’ve finally succeeded!” Li Xiuping’s energy stabilized, returning to his usual composed demeanor. He coldly smiled.

“Forget what just happened. Did you hear me?” Li Xiuping commanded the disciple, who had fallen to the ground in terror.

“Yes… yes…” The disciple stammered, his eyes trembling as he looked up—Li Xiuping was nowhere to be seen. The old woman also vanished from the dungeon.

…

At Feiyun Sect’s mountain gates, Luo Tian and his group waited for a long time. Ning Qingzhu, naturally impulsive, could not wait any longer and shouted: “Old man! When will that Xiuping come out? I’ll count to ten, and if he doesn’t show up, we’ll start fighting. Who dares stop me!”

Deng Jiusi heard Ning Qingzhu call him “old man” and suppressed his anger, whispering: “He should be coming soon.”

“Ten! Nine! Eight…!” Ning Qingzhu ignored him and began counting aloud.

Feiyun Sect’s disciples saw a beautiful woman step out, daring to call their Grand Elder “old man.” Their hearts burned with anger.

Young people were naturally impulsive. Being blocked at the mountain gates had already made them angry, and Ning Qingzhu’s bold provocation caused a riot.

“Little girl, what are you? Daring to speak like that to our Grand Elder!” Feiyun Sect disciples shouted.

“Five!” Ning Qingzhu had just reached five when she heard the Feiyun Sect disciples’ shouts.

Though Ning Qingzhu was usually bold, those who knew her well understood she could be the most terrifying person on Qingmu Peak when angry.

“Four!” Ning Qingzhu furrowed her brows and continued counting.

“Little girl, how old are you? Are you alive?” The people saw Ning Qingzhu not respond and grew bolder.

“Three!” As soon as the word was spoken, Ning Qingzhu vanished from her spot. She appeared before the most vocal Feiyun Sect disciple, lifting her foot and kicking him away.

The disciple had intended to continue cursing but felt a gust of fragrant wind before him, instinctively sniffed it, then felt a searing pain in his abdomen. He spat blood and was thrown backward.

Before the disciple landed, Ning Qingzhu reappeared before him, grabbing his robe and throwing him toward where Luo Tian’s group was. Her movements were fluid and seamless, returning to her original spot. The sound of the number “three” still echoed in people’s ears.

“Gu Lei, I leave him to you. If you don’t torment him enough, be careful of the auntie’s torment!” Ning Qingzhu coldly said.

Feiyun Sect disciples were stunned, looking at the captured disciple and fear flickered on their faces. They all fell silent.

Gu Lei laughed, his lips curling slightly as he approached the Feiyun Sect disciple: “Kid, you shouldn’t have offended this auntie. I feel sorry for you.”

After saying that, Gu Lei extended his hand and stuffed a purple elixir into the disciple’s mouth.

“Two!” Ning Qingzhu ignored what happened behind her and continued counting, her eyes glancing toward Feiyun Sect with a provocative look.

“You truly overstep!” Deng Jiusi finally could not contain his anger. The opponent had repeatedly ignored him, and now they insulted Feiyun Sect disciples in front of him. This was a blow to his dignity as Grand Elder.

His Bone-Devouring Stage late-phase energy radiated, pressing toward Luo Tian’s group. Some Feiyun Sect elders who supported Deng Jiusi followed him.

“Old man, you finally couldn’t hold it in, huh? Come on! Let me see how your Bone-Devouring Stage late-phase differs from those of the Wuxing Sect!” Ning Qingzhu laughed lightly, confidence radiating from her tall figure.

As a Wuxing Sect genius, Ning Qingzhu was confident she could face a Bone-Devouring Stage late-phase opponent. After all, in the Wuxing Sect, she could match them evenly!

“Ning Senior Sister, leave this old man to me!” Lei Yong spoke loudly.

“This trash shouldn’t trouble Senior Brother Lei! Let us handle it!” The Bone-Devouring Stage masters behind Lei Yong all volunteered to fight.

Deng Jiusi’s face darkened, his expression as gloomy as water. He was angered by these Wuxing Sect Bone-Devouring Stage youths looking down on him, especially those at the early stage who seemed to be able to crush him effortlessly. This made this Bone-Devouring Stage late-phase master even angrier.

Deng Jiusi’s slow steps unintentionally quickened.

Lei Yong and Ning Qingzhu also slowly advanced, their auras colliding in an explosive clash. A breeze formed at the point of collision, blowing toward both sides’ disciples.

Luo Tian’s group was better off; those who came were generally at Body-Refining Stage eighth or ninth levels. Feiyun Sect’s side was not so fortunate; some Body-Refining Stage fourth or fifth-level disciples swayed unsteadily. This showed the terrifying power of Bone-Devouring Stage masters—just their unintentional aura could achieve this.

However, just as the two sides were about to clash, a calm voice rang out: “Luo Tian, sorry for keeping you waiting. Did I arrive late?”

Hearing this voice, Deng Jiusi sighed inwardly, knowing the Bone-Devouring Stage clash would not happen. If it did, he would suffer heavy losses.

Those following him were his years of painstakingly cultivated loyal disciples; losing one would hurt him for a long time. Moreover, he was at a disadvantage regardless of calculation; there was even the possibility of total annihilation. This made him reluctant, but he had no choice.

At this moment, Li Xiuping’s arrival was just the solution to Deng Jiusi’s urgent problem. He naturally turned his gaze toward this satisfactory disciple.

Li Xiuping’s calm figure appeared in people’s sight, causing Feiyun Sect disciples to cheer. Li Xiuping was a godlike figure in their hearts.

A dual-attribute genius, even the Wuxing Sect would fight over him. People did not understand why Li Xiuping chose this small Feiyun Sect, which was why he had become so prominent within it.

Luo Tian, who had been silent, saw Li Xiuping’s figure and his eyes flashed a cold glint. His spiritual sense extended, sensing Li Xiuping’s Body-Refining Stage ninth-level cultivation. A relaxed expression appeared on his face—anyone at the Body-Refining Stage, he had confidence to overpower.

“Timing was just right!” Luo Tian smiled lightly and stepped forward, speaking softly but with an unmistakable chill in his voice.

Chapter 99: Battle Against Li Xiuping

Chapter 99: Battle Against Li Xiuping

“Such a grand display!” Li Xiuping glanced at the nearly thousand Body-Refining Stage disciples and dozens of Bone-Devouring Stage masters, his face flashing a brief surprise.

“There’s no choice but to be afraid of being surrounded!” Luo Tian lightly brushed his robes and approached Li Xiuping.

“Since you’ve come, draw a boundary! I, Li Xiuping, will accept it!” Li Xiuping looked at the changed Luo Tian and pressed his aura toward him.

“Draw a boundary? What’s there to say with you? Only one battle!” Luo Tian spoke, sensing Li Xiuping’s pressure. He ignored it and rushed toward Li Xiuping like a primordial dragon, his overwhelming battle intent piercing the sky.

“Body-Refining Stage ninth-level?” Li Xiuping’s eyes flickered with surprise. He had not expected Luo Tian to have such a terrifying progression—only half a year, and he was already at the same level as himself.

But Li Xiuping was Li Xiuping; his expression quickly returned to calmness: “This is interesting!”

He raised his fist, red energy spewing forth and meeting Luo Tian’s attack head-on.

“Boom…” The two fought without using any martial arts, their collision producing continuous thunderous sounds.

“This Li Xiuping is truly remarkable! He can match my little brother’s abnormal physique evenly!” Lei Yong’s face darkened, watching Luo Tian and Li Xiuping.

“Li Senior Brother, fight hard! Defeat this Wuxing Sect genius!” The surrounding Feiyun Sect disciples cheered for Li Xiuping, their faces filled with excitement. In their eyes, Li Xiuping had never disappointed them.

“Five Elements Body!” Deng Jiusi observed Luo Tian’s energy fluctuations and was stunned. He knew that when Luo Tian had been expelled, he had only possessed a single earth attribute. Though Li Xiuping had told him about Luo Tian’s changes, seeing it with his own eyes still shocked him.

Watching the two fight, Deng Jiusi was astonished by Luo Tian’s transformation but still confident in Li Xiuping. He believed his most favored disciple was the brightest genius, unmatched.

“Five Elements Body!” The Feiyun Sect elders also noticed Luo Tian’s physique, their faces pale. This was a genius who had been expelled by Feiyun Sect. If Luo Tian hadn’t been cast out, how glorious would Feiyun Sect have become?

Thinking this, the elders’ gazes toward Deng Jiusi all carried blame. In their eyes, even a hundred Li Xiupings were not as valuable as one Five Elements Body.

“Boom…” The collision sound returned, and both Luo Tian and Li Xiuping retreated simultaneously, their eyes coldly staring at each other.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve grown to the point where I must fear you. This time, I’ll definitely keep you, even if it means facing the Wuxing Sect’s wrath!” Li Xiuping’s eyes gleamed with coldness, his words echoing.

“Can I take this as a confirmation?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, his voice cold.

Though they spoke, their hands moved swiftly, chaotic energy fluctuations constantly emerging from their hands.

“Wood generates fire! Unyielding Yellow Fist!” Li Xiuping knew that if he continued to fight bare-handed, he would lose. So he decided to use his martial arts.

“How? You want to fight with martial arts? I’ll join you! Five Elements Generation, Human King Seal!” Luo Tian also roared and pushed out a massive seal.

“Strong!” Both Feiyun Sect and Wuxing Sect disciples, watching Luo Tian and Li Xiuping, thought this sentence.

“Haha… to see Luo Tian use this move, Li Xiuping has some skill!” Zhang Hongyun watched Luo Tian’s Human King Seal and wore a bitter expression. He had lost to this move during that month when everyone could challenge Luo Tian.

Feng Qianyu nodded in agreement upon hearing Zhang Hongyun’s words; he had certainly felt the terror of this martial art.

“Little Master, why did you use such a resource-draining Human King Seal right away?” Lei Yong asked in confusion.

“Probably he doesn’t want to lose to Li Xiuping in any aspect,” Gu Qianxue, who knew Luo Tian’s character, explained to Lei Yong.

Another thunderous sound rang out; the surrounding Body-Refining Stage disciples felt as if a thunderclap had exploded in their ears, momentarily stunning them.

The two’s martial arts collided violently. To everyone’s surprise, Li Xiuping’s fist only lasted a moment before being dispersed by Luo Tian’s massive seal.

The Human King Seal pressed down like Mount Tai, continuing toward Li Xiuping.

Another thunderous sound echoed; a deep pit formed where Li Xiuping had stood, and his figure vanished.

“Li Senior Brother? Did he get crushed into nothingness?” A Feiyun Sect disciple asked fearfully.

“Nonsense! How could Li Senior Brother lose!” Others scolded the disciple who had spoken.

“Did he dodge? His speed was enough!”

Luo Tian’s lips curled, his spiritual sense extending to find Li Xiuping.

But as Luo Tian extended his spiritual sense, a sound of breaking air echoed from above. A fierce energy fluctuation followed, and a large foot slammed toward Luo Tian.

“Jumping high!” Luo Tian felt the energy fluctuation and focused his gaze on the foot. He had no time to dodge, so he rushed five energies into his right fist and met the foot head-on.

A sound of something breaking echoed again, cracks spreading from Luo Tian’s feet outward. His entire legs were deeply embedded in Feiyun Sect’s stone path, and his body seemed to shrink slightly.

Li Xiuping reappeared in people’s sight, his white clothes fluttering without wind, a calm aura radiating from him.

Feiyun Sect disciples erupted into cheers upon seeing Li Xiuping’s figure, some even weeping with joy.

“Show your true strength! This is the price of coming to challenge me. If that’s all, then it ends!”

“Li Xiuping coldly spoke, his hand now holding a long sword. A fierce aura radiated from the blade.

Luo Tian saw Li Xiuping draw his yellow-grade long sword and pulled his leg from the ground: “Warm-up over. Let’s begin officially!”

“Rending Sky Spear!” Luo Tian murmured, and a black spear, like a black dragon, soared from his storage ring into his hand.

Chapter 100: Lan Yū

Chapter 100: Lan Yū

The Rending Sky Spear settled in Luo Tian’s hand. Sensing the faint bloodline power from it, he smiled lightly: “Comrade, since you’ve joined me, have you seen blood before? How long has it been since your last taste of blood? Today, let you feel the flavor of blood again!”

“Ugh…” As if understanding Luo Tian’s words, the spear emitted a hum. Cold light radiated from its tip.

Upon seeing Luo Tian draw the Rending Sky Spear, Li Xiuping felt Luo Tian’s aura rise. It was as if Luo Tian had become the sole master of the world.

“Want to sacrifice me with your spear?” Li Xiuping coldly snorted and raised his sword, fiercely slashing toward Luo Tian.

A streak of thunderous blade energy, like a bolt of lightning, carved a deep crack in the stone ground and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes remained calm, his hands gripping the spear as he raised it high. The blade and spear collided with a deafening roar.

“A yellow-grade high-level weapon, truly terrifying!” The surrounding disciples marveled, even some Bone-Devouring Stage masters sighed at the two’s extraordinary talent.

Luo Tian ignored their admiration and, after deflecting the blade energy, activated three attributes within his body. A brilliant white light illuminated the entire Feiyun Sect mountain gate, as if filling the world with this light.

The surrounding disciples felt their eyes burn painfully and instinctively closed them.

Li Xiuping, upon the light’s emergence, had a moment of blindness and muttered “bad.” He quickly closed his eyes and retreated.

“Too late!” Luo Tian gave no chance to Li Xiuping, for even a moment of blindness was enough. He slightly lifted the spear and unleashed the “Golden Snake Wild Dance,” sending countless spear shadows toward Li Xiuping.

Li Xiuping’s speed had reached its peak, but he was still struck multiple times. He felt a cold energy pierce his body, and this energy carried an intense tearing force.

The light faded; people gradually opened their eyes, adapting to the light. When they regained sight, especially Feiyun Sect disciples, they stared in disbelief at the two figures.

At this moment, Li Xiuping’s hair was disheveled, his entire body stained with blood. He looked utterly pitiful, no longer the same as before. This had happened in an instant.

“Impossible! How could Li Senior Brother lose!” Feiyun Sect disciples all roared, disbelieving what they saw.

Deng Jiusi looked at Li Xiuping with concern. He had never seen Li Xiuping so pitiful before. But this time was different, and Deng Jiusi’s confidence in Li Xiuping wavered. His gaze toward Luo Tian turned cold, but he quickly suppressed his urge to attack and continued observing silently.

“How? The taste of blood!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed, as if speaking to the Rending Sky Spear or addressing Li Xiuping’s pitiful state.

“I admit, you are truly powerful now. I am not your match!” Li Xiuping showed no concern for his wounds, his eyes instead flashing excitement.

He lifted his finger and wiped the blood from his face, as if transformed. He extended his red tongue and licked the blood on his hand, his eyes flashing a red light: “You’ve completely enraged me!”

“Stop the nonsense. Show your full strength! I, Luo Tian, will accept it!” Luo Tian held the Rending Sky Spear. Though his words were dismissive, his eyes remained locked on Li Xiuping without underestimating him. At this moment, Li Xiuping seemed off to him, a faint sense of danger stirred within.

Luo Tian was not the only one who noticed Li Xiuping’s change; other Bone-Devouring Stage masters also felt his transformation, their brows furrowing slightly.

“Wait until I let you meet an old friend. I believe seeing her will surprise you!” Li Xiuping’s lips twisted with ferocity, his eyes flashing red.

Hearing Li Xiuping speak thusly, Luo Tian felt an inexplicable bad premonition. His heart had a sudden jolt of fear.

Li Xiuping bit his finger and waved it in the air, emitting a stream of bloodstained energy that filled the surrounding area.

“Soul-Devouring Energy! What kind of technique is this? It feels so evil. The bloodstained energy must have gathered the blood of many to create such thick凶煞 (evil) energy!” Lei Yong’s face finally showed a hint of concern.

“Xiuping has such an evil technique. How come I didn’t know?” Deng Jiusi widened his eyes, his face dark with confusion.

All eyes were on Li Xiuping, eager to see what power this evil technique could unleash. Though evil techniques were common on the Tianyuan Continent, some sects still resisted them. Originally, Feiyun Sect disciples had looked at Li Xiuping with admiration, but now their gazes changed.

As the bloodstained energy spread, Li Xiuping was enveloped in this crimson aura. His entire body was surrounded within ten feet, and he vanished from people’s sight.

“Furnace of Heaven, Soul-Devouring Technique! Blood Transmutation into a Corpse!” A low voice echoed from the crimson aura.

Though invisible, Luo Tian’s spiritual sense remained alert, observing Li Xiuping. At this moment, his spiritual sense detected another person, a terrifying pressure radiating from her body as she absorbed the surrounding凶煞 (evil) energy.

When Luo Tian carefully identified this person absorbing the evil energy, his face showed shock and waves of fury.

“Lan Yū!” Luo Tian’s expression was filled with disbelief, for this person absorbing the evil energy—Luo Tian had met her twice before!

Lan Yū, a Feiyun Sect elder. This was not what shocked Luo Tian; it was Lan Yū’s other identity—Chen Yunting’s master!

Luo Tian had never expected Lan Yū to appear in this form. If Lan Yū was like this, what about Chen Yunting? Luo Tian’s bad premonition deepened.

As Luo Tian was confused, Lan Yū had already absorbed all the evil energy and appeared in people’s sight.

“Lan Yū!” Feiyun Sect elders exclaimed, stunned by the old woman who had completely absorbed the evil energy.

Lan Yū now had a slightly rosy face, her body radiating waves of Bone-Devouring Stage energy. Yet her eyes were filled with凶煞 (evil) energy, and she stood motionless.

“Luo Tian, do you know this old woman?” Li Xiuping saw Luo Tian’s shocked expression and his face turned pale. He had clearly expended much energy using this technique.

Chapter 101: Battle Against Bone-Devouring Stage

Chapter 101: Battle Against Bone-Devouring Stage

“Chen Yunting! Where is she!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, suppressing his unease and asking.

“Li Xiuping! How could you do this? Framing Lan Yū was one thing, but torturing her like this! Deng Jiusi! You’ve gone too far!” Elders who had long been at odds with Deng Jiusi roared.

Deng Jiusi also looked grim, watching Li Xiuping. He hadn’t expected Li Xiuping to do this. From the technique he used, Deng Jiusi felt his beloved disciple had something hidden from him.

“After this matter is resolved, I will give you all an explanation!” Deng Jiusi’s face was dark, but Li Xiuping was his disciple. His heart still protected him.

“Hmph! If we are not satisfied, we will report to the Sect Leader. The Leader will decide fairly!” One elder coldly snorted.

“Luo Tian knows this old woman?” Lei Yong and others were surprised, sensing Luo Tian’s unusual expression.

“This old woman is clearly controlled by Li Xiuping. Luo Tian has big trouble!” Unlike others, Ji Chen coldly spoke.

Upon hearing Ji Chen’s words, the others realized it. This old woman was a Bone-Devouring Stage master; they all looked at Luo Tian with concern.
