“Crush!” Luo Tian waved his hands, and a powerful artifact instantly transformed into a terrifying storm, sweeping down upon Tu Feiyang with overwhelming force.

“Those are all mine!” Sun Kerenian exclaimed, nearly spitting out blood as he watched Luo Tian’s artifacts. The items were none other than those he had previously extorted from himself in the hall, nothing was missing.

“You…” Tu Feiyang’s eyes shifted instantly as he gazed upon the artifacts enhanced by the Eight Desolate Relic Sealing Art. Each one radiated overwhelming power, pressing heavily upon him.

A few items might have been dismissed by Tu Feiyang, but hundreds of them—plus several pseudo-Epoch Treasures—were enough to overwhelm him.

“You dare challenge me with these external objects?” Tu Feiyang summoned his crimson severed head to repel the relentless attacks of the artifacts.

“Dare?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smile, but his foot took another step forward, pressing toward Tu Feiyang.

“Damn it!” Tu Feiyang’s body was filled with frustration. He had not anticipated Luo Tian would use so many artifacts to crush him.

“Hum…” The crimson severed head clashed with the sky-bound relics, shattering one after another under its might.

“Those were my hard-earned treasures! You bastard used them like disposable talismans!” Sun Kerenian raged, watching Luo Tian destroy the items he had extorted from him.

“Crack…” As Luo Tian took his fourth step, the heavens trembled violently. A thunderous roar erupted between the three, pale faces reflecting their shock as Luo Tian’s fourth step disintegrated.

Chapter 1374: The Emergence of the Ancient Royal Clan

The sky shattered, a violent shockwave spreading across Jietian Mountain as if the world itself had been split open. Vast waves of gray mist surged forth from the annihilated heavens, descending upon Luo Tian and his companions.

The wild fluctuations instantly dissolved Luo Tian’s assault, pinning him and Tu Feiyang to the ground.

Black and white qi surged forth from the gray mist, revealing a robust figure before their eyes—stunning them into silence.

“Have you reached a conclusion?” Luo Tian, Tu Feiyang, and Sun Kerenian exchanged tense glances, their gazes fixed on the imposing figure of Dongbo Xin in the void.

“Boom…” Dongbo Xin’s body descended from the sky, his lips dry with blood, his body riddled with grievous wounds. Black and white qi danced over the injuries, repairing him as if he had been wounded by a celestial force.

“Master!” Luo Tian’s eyes filled with concern as he beheld Dongbo Xin, the first time he had seen him so severely injured.

“Nothing to worry about,” Dongbo Xin murmured, his voice still resounding but tinged with exhaustion.

“Did you destroy that malevolent will of the Jietian Lord?” Sun Kerenian stammered, his eyes wide with disbelief as he regarded Dongbo Xin like a deity.

Tu Feiyang’s gaze was equally anxious, his mind reeling at how Dongbo Xin had slain such a being.

“Only five in the world could match him,” Tu Feiyang murmured, his respect for Dongbo Xin evident.

An Epoch Master could subdue the nine heavens and ten earths, their power absolute even against a malevolent will. Yet this being had been slain by the old man before them.

“Pseudo-Epoch Master!” Tu Feiyang’s face paled, realization dawning.

“Pseudo-Epoch Master?” Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian exchanged glances, their expressions shifting. They had heard of this realm before.

Since ancient times, people knew that after reaching the Epoch Master’s peak came the Epoch Master himself. But some prodigies had transcended this, achieving the Pseudo-Epoch Master’s level—unparalleled unless an Epoch Master existed.

Only those at the Pseudo-Epoch Master’s level could vie for the Epoch Master’s throne. Thus, Dongbo Xin had a high chance of becoming an unparalleled force in this epoch.

“Certainly!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with exhilaration, his gaze filled with reverence as he watched Dongbo Xin. He knew the trials this man had endured.

Within the Divine and Demon Cave, he had sealed himself on the Divine and Demon Altar for a million years. After emerging, he vanished from sight. Though Luo Tian did not know what Dongbo Xin had faced, merely weakening his demonic essence within an Epoch Master’s killing array was beyond ordinary strength.

Divine and Demon Dual Cultivation had only ever been achieved by the Divine and Demon Sovereign. Now, Dongbo Xin had broken free of his shackles, achieving a power no one could match. Even Luo Tian doubted he could reach this level.

“Let’s go,” Dongbo Xin said, his gaze unspoken as he turned to Tu Feiyang. “I will not kill you this time, but inform your blood clan’s elders that if they trespass on the human realm, I will visit their domain.”

His words were soft but thunderous in Tu Feiyang’s ears, shaking his very soul.

Though the Ancient Royal Clan was mighty and deep-rooted, being targeted by such a power would see them collapse eventually. This was the might of a Pseudo-Epoch Master.

“Thank you, Master,” Tu Feiyang bowed respectfully, his voice laced with reverence.

“Hmph, leave. I assume you have means to protect yourself. I won’t accompany you,” Dongbo Xin gazed toward the fractured void, his expression unreadable.

“Yes!” Tu Feiyang dared not linger, though he was reluctant. He had only obtained one martial technique in the Jietian Lord’s inheritance, leaving him disgruntled. Yet with Dongbo Xin present, killing Luo Tian was impossible.

“Hum…” A blood-red light descended upon Tu Feiyang, enveloping him before he vanished into the wild void.

“You two have also received inheritance. The Jietian lands are about to close—leave,” Dongbo Xin extended his hand, gazing deeply at Zhongdao Mountain before vanishing with Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian.

“Thank you…” A low voice echoed across Zhongdao Mountain, the wild void beginning to mend.

…

In the void, Dongbo Xin was surrounded by black and white qi, his form weaving through space. Behind him, Luo Tian’s seven-colored flames resisted the void’s immense pressure, while Sun Kerenian’s head was protected by a floating Yang Fish Tortoise Shell.

The three traversed the void toward the Nine Domains, Luo Tian’s eyes filled with admiration as he watched Dongbo Xin ahead.

Though his injuries had not yet healed, even a wounded body moved through the void with no resistance.

“Powerful… When will I reach such a level?” Luo Tian mused, his heart swelling with excitement at returning to the Nine Domains.

“Lost everything! I’ve never made such a loss—nothing gained, yet I spent so many treasures. When have I ever taken a loss?”

“Luo Tian, can you stay away from me? Every time we meet, I lose!” Sun Kerenian grumbled, his gaze sharp at Luo Tian.

“Go to hell! I don’t want to meet you either!” Luo Tian shot him a glare, clearly uninterested.

“Master Dongbo! You’ve achieved such power—why no weapon? Let’s go to the Origin Domain and rob some royal tombs. Maybe we’ll find a weapon for you!” Sun Kerenian’s eyes gleamed with greed, his thoughts turning to Dongbo Xin.

“Hear about the Ancient Royal Clan’s great tombs? They’re full of treasures, even some containing kings!” Sun Kerenian persisted, trying to ingratiate himself.

“Don’t you dare think I’d associate with you!” Luo Tian sneered at Sun Kerenian.

“Consider it,” Dongbo Xin replied softly, leaving Luo Tian speechless.

“Don’t underestimate their lineage,” Dongbo Xin said calmly, his gaze on Sun Kerenian.

“Haha! Master truly sees talent! Let’s go now! Let this kid return to the Nine Domains alone. Master, rest assured—there’ll be no treasures in the Ancient Royal Clan’s tombs!” Sun Kerenian grinned, casting a glance at Luo Tian with smugness.

“Not now,” Dongbo Xin’s gaze darkened, his body halting as he stared into the distance.

“What is it?” Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian halted instantly, their gazes scanning the void. Though nothing seemed amiss, they stood behind Dongbo Xin, tense.

“Boom…” As they pondered, a thunderous roar echoed through the void. A hundred miles away, gray mist surged violently.

A colossal ancient warship pierced through the swirling void space, appearing before their eyes—stunning Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian.

“What is that?” Sun Kerenian’s eyes widened, his disbelief evident as he stared at the massive vessel.

“It’s an Ancient Royal Clan warship searching for the Nine Domains,” Dongbo Xin murmured, his tone grave.

“Master, have you seen it before?” Luo Tian’s gaze was heavy with concern.

“I encountered it once, and we fought. I was severely wounded and fled into the Origin Domain,” Dongbo Xin replied solemnly, leaving Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian in shock.

Dongbo Xin’s strength was undeniable, yet this ship had wounded him. How terrifying must the Ancient Royal Clan be?

“Human! Haha, finally seeing humans again! Come here and take us into the Nine Domains!” A powerful mental voice surged into Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian’s minds, instantly rendering them unconscious as they flew toward the ship.

“Awaken!” Dongbo Xin bellowed, his black and white qi surging into their bodies. They awoke instantly, sweat drenching their brows.

“Master, what do we do? Should we run?” Sun Kerenian trembled, his voice quivering.

Chapter 1375: Return to the Nine Domains

The thunderous roar shook the void, Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian’s faces etched with awe as they gazed at the approaching ancient warship.

The ship was rusted, its aura reeking of decay. But what terrified them most were the dozens of elders seated cross-legged upon it, their auras oppressive and formidable.

“The Ancient Royal Clan’s warship searching for the Nine Domains, it has roamed the void for years, seeking a gateway into the Nine Domains.”

Their strength was each at the Epoch Master’s peak, matching or surpassing even the Grand Minister of the Star Moon Divine Clan, Fu Wenbin.

“You two go around and return to the Nine Domains. Don’t let them continue searching—this place is near the Nine Domains!” Dongbo Xin ordered, then launched himself toward the ship.

At the same time, his battle spirit surged, an overwhelming aura radiating from him. He recalled how these people had once humiliated him.

“Master!” Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian called out, their voices laced with worry. A ship full of Epoch Master-level beings—though Dongbo Xin was extraordinary, he might still fall. Especially after his injuries on Jietian Mountain.

“Another one! The human who escaped before!” The ship’s voice echoed, its tone filled with shock.

“Kill!” Dongbo Xin’s robust body descended upon the ancient ship, black and white qi swirling around him as he charged toward the clan’s elders.

“Die! You escaped before, but now you dare attack us!” The ship’s voice roared, leaving Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian in sheer terror.

“Boom…” Dongbo Xin’s response was a single, devastating punch that split the heavens. He struck without hesitation, aiming for an Epoch Master elder.

“Boom…” The elder was struck by the punch, his eyes wide with disbelief as he spat blood and collided with the ship’s hull, nearly toppling it.

“Stronger!” The elders’ eyes flashed with light as they leapt into the air, charging toward Dongbo Xin. They felt his overwhelming aura.

“Roar…” Black and white qi surged, Dongbo Xin’s long hair flying as he wielded both Yin and Yang. Facing the elders’ attacks, he showed no fear, striking repeatedly as they clashed upon the ancient ship.

“Go!” Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian exchanged glances, their faces pale as the battle’s aura swept toward them. Such a level of combat was beyond their capacity to join unless they had an Epoch Treasure.

“You’re strong, but we are many Epoch Masters. Even if several fall, you’ll die in this endless void!” The voice echoed through the ship, its wild fluctuations spreading toward Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian.

“Master Dongbo, stay safe!” Luo Tian called out as he watched the battle, his seven-colored flames roaring. He and Sun Kerenian turned and vanished into the void.

They flew for half an hour but still heard the battle’s echoes, their minds trembling.

“I wonder how it ends…” Luo Tian murmured, his voice laced with worry. Though Dongbo Xin was strong, the ship’s elders would surely overwhelm him.

“Master Dongbo is blocking the Ancient Royal Clan,” Sun Kerenian said solemnly, bowing toward the battle.

Only Dongbo Xin could stand alone against the Ancient Royal Clan. If they found a gateway into the Nine Domains, it would be a disaster.

Back then, the Nine Saints of the Mortal Domain had only been an Epoch Master and nearly crippled the Nine Domains. If this ship’s elders entered, with the Ancient Royal Clan’s hatred, they would surely massacre the Nine Domains. Who could stop them?

“Grow stronger!” Luo Tian’s heart roared, envisioning the Ancient Royal Clan invading. Without strength, he could not protect his loved ones.

“Hope Master Dongbo survives,” Sun Kerenian sighed, reverence in his eyes. If Dongbo Xin died, the Nine Domains would lose a great power guarding them from the clan’s attacks.

“He will survive,” Luo Tian murmured, and they changed direction, flying toward the Nine Domains.

“How is the Nine Domains?” Luo Tian asked Sun Kerenian as they flew, his concern evident. They had been away for nearly fifteen years.

Sun Kerenian’s eyes flickered with a smile before he replied, “I’ve been away for four or five years. I don’t know what it’s like now.”

“But when I left, I knew your descendants faced trouble—someone killed them!” Sun Kerenian said softly.

“What?!” Luo Tian’s aura exploded with fury, his eyes flashing with killing intent, making Sun Kerenian shiver.

“Don’t get worked up. I haven’t heard of your descendants dying yet!” Sun Kerenian quickly reassured him, watching Luo Tian’s unstable aura.

Sun Kerenian’s words calmed Luo Tian slightly, but his eyes still burned with intent. Sun Kerenian had been away for four or five years—what could have happened in that time?

“Still, your descendants are extraordinary. Your son is no joke—his void body crushed his peers. I left when he had already reached the Super-Ordinary realm!” Sun Kerenian smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Your two disciples are also extraordinary. Though they aren’t divine bodies, their strength is terrifying—nearly catching up to our generation!” Sun Kerenian added, making Luo Tian’s brow furrow.

“But their brilliance brought trouble!” Sun Kerenian shook his head, knowing Luo Tian understood.

Luo Tian knew well—his path had been forged through blood and battle, making the sects fear him.

“What about the Four Sacred Star Domains?” Luo Tian asked again, his worry deepening. He feared their old enemies had united to attack it.

“The Four Sacred Star Domains are strong now. Those of your generation have grown into domain masters, supported by the Demon Domain and Fire Domain. So far, nothing has happened. Plus, your great contributions to the Nine Domains mean they won’t openly attack it!” Sun Kerenian said softly, easing Luo Tian’s mind.

“After so many years, have they forgotten me?” Luo Tian sighed, his killing intent sharpening.

“It seems the peaceful Nine Domains will stir again,” Sun Kerenian mused, watching Luo Tian’s intent.

“But where is your thief companion? You two were inseparable!” Luo Tian asked again, his gaze on Sun Kerenian.

“Don’t mention it! I dug up your grave, and those from the Four Sacred Star Domains chased me like madmen. Even the Divine Emperor Mirror and Ancient Heaven Palace joined in! I was trapped between heaven and earth!”

“I don’t get it. I just took a broken gun! What did I do? Why was it so bad?” Sun Kerenian’s eyes flashed with resentment.

He had aimed for the Yin Fish Relic, but it was near the Ancient Heaven Palace—no chance. Even Sima Tuo, a thief feared by all, had no opportunity. And the Yin Fish Relic didn’t want to follow him.

“But I’m a master, and I fought my way out of their hands!” Sun Kerenian grinned.

“Fought? Who did you kill?” Luo Tian’s gaze darkened.

“Ahh…” Sun Kerenian shivered, recalling the volatile nature of the person before him.

“I didn’t kill anyone! I had to fight two Epoch Treasures!” Sun Kerenian stammered, recalling how they were ambushed.

“Who was it? I don’t know! We got separated, and I took the stone tablet key into the void. As for Sima Tuo, I don’t know his fate—probably not good!” Sun Kerenian’s eyes flashed with intent.

“Don’t let me find out who it was!” Sun Kerenian gritted his teeth, his eyes cold.

“Hmph…” Their auras surged as they traversed the void, their positions precise. Though fast, it took them a month to find the Nine Domains’ gateway.

“Here!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up, his gaze on the thin spatial barrier before him. “Break it!”

Luo Tian roared, his hands touching the barrier, tearing at it furiously. A vast spatial rift formed under his assault, familiar energy flooding his senses—his excitement palpable.

But before he could revel, a figure burst into the void, causing his face to shift slightly.

“Haha! Inheritor of that person, you’ve lasted this long—still managing to escape into the void!”

“But why leave the Four Sacred Star Domains and come alone? You’re quite confident!” As the figure entered the void, a mocking laugh echoed.

“Run! Don’t say you saw me!” The young voice rang in Luo Tian’s ears, his bloodied robes but radiant aura. Though wounded, his eyes flashed with cold light.

Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian studied the youth before them, and Luo Tian’s brows furrowed—something deep within him stirred.

“Why does this kid look like you?” Sun Kerenian asked, confusion in his gaze as he stared at the teenager.

“Why wouldn’t he?” Luo Tian’s eyes welled up, his hand reaching out to seize the youth with an irresistible force.

“Damn! There’s an Epoch Master!” The youth’s face paled instantly, his body pulsing with waves of energy.

“Hum…” The hum resonated as the youth seemed to break free from Luo Tian’s grip, his body moving like a fish in water.

“Luo Li! Who am I?” Luo Tian smiled softly, his bloodline power surging into the youth’s body.

The youth paused, a familiar feeling stirring within him—long forgotten. He stilled, gazing at Luo Tian with disbelief.

“You…!” His body trembled as he stared at Luo Tian, his eyes wide with shock.

“Who are you to dare impersonate my father!” The youth’s face twisted into madness, his eyes blood-red as he lunged at Luo Tian with a hand seal.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded, his eyes filled with satisfaction. Though the attack was nothing to him now, it was formidable for a Super-Ordinary level warrior.

Moreover, the space itself seemed to vibrate with his attack, amplifying its power.

“Little brat! I’m your father!” Luo Tian smiled, deflecting the youth’s attack.

“Impossible! My father is dead! Who are you!” The youth’s face still bore his youth, his eyes sharp. Though subdued, he remained resolute.

“Fifteen years!” Luo Tian’s heart ached as he gazed at the grown-up Luo Li, sighing deeply. When he left, Luo Li was only three years old—clinging to him constantly. Now, he had become an eighteen-year-old youth.

“Son, I’m not dead!” Luo Tian shook his head, not explaining further but tossing the youth to Sun Kerenian.

“Hum…” A gust of wind surged as two figures appeared before Luo Tian and Sun Kerenian. Cloaked in black veils, their faces were obscured by sacred treasures, revealing only cold eyes that glared at the two.

“Who are you? Give me the kid!” They spoke in unison, their voices as if from one mouth.

At their appearance, Luo Tian’s face turned icy, his killing intent unhidden. He had sensed their cultivation was at the Super-Ordinary level.

“Two Super-Ordinary masters chasing a Super-Ordinary kid? I’d like to see who you are!” Luo Tian grabbed them with his Epoch Initial level aura, pulling them toward him.

“Epoch Initial!” Their faces shifted instantly, their gazes now filled with disbelief.

“Boom…” The black veils burst apart, revealing two middle-aged men’s faces—eyes wide with shock.

“You… you’re…” Their eyes widened in disbelief, as if seeing a ghost.

Luo Tian had been absent from the Nine Domains for years, but his name was known to all. Though they hadn’t recognized him at first, now that they saw his face, it was clear—Luo Tian had returned.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian murmured, recognizing their origin from their faces.

The two men were identical in appearance and aura—only one place in the Nine Domains could achieve this: the Divine and Demon Domain’s Yin Yang Sect.

“Yin Yang Sect has boldness to attack my descendants!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold light, his hand seizing them for soul-searching. His expression darkened further after the search.

They were only Super-Ordinary level, incapable of knowing much—only targeting low-level geniuses in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Each mission was assigned by the Yin Yang Sect’s Supreme Disciple.

“Was it the Divine Clan?” Luo Tian crushed them, his mind deep in thought. He grabbed the stunned Luo Li and fled with Sun Kerenian into the void.

“Fire Domain!” Upon emerging, Luo Tian’s face lit up, his eyes moist as he felt the Fire Domain’s familiar aura. He laughed aloud.

A roar shook the stars—fifteen years of longing to return to the Nine Domains. How could he not be excited?

“Son, now do you believe?” Luo Tian smiled, turning to Luo Li, his eyes filled with guilt.

“Impossible! Impossible!” Luo Li’s green face was etched with shock, disbelief staring at Luo Tian.

Luo Li pinched Sun Kerenian’s arm fiercely before hearing his howl of pain.

“Kid, what are you doing? Don’t think because you’re Luo Tian’s son I won’t beat you!” Sun Kerenian shouted.

“You’re that grave robber! Where’s my father’s Splitting Heaven Gun!” Luo Li immediately recognized Sun Kerenian, his eyes flashing with madness.

“You’re not my father! You’re with this grave robber—how could you be my father!” Luo Li shouted, his eyes burning with anger.

“Damn…” Luo Tian felt helpless, his eyes weary as he ruffled his head, feeling a headache.

“Surely! That grave robber and thief are skilled in transformation. I may be young, but I’m not gullible! If you let me go, my uncle and Jiang Uncle will chase you with Epoch Treasures!” Luo Li’s calmness returned as he scrutinized the two.

“Haha…” Sun Kerenian laughed until tears flowed, his eyes filled with mockery toward Luo Tian.

“Son doesn’t recognize his father!” Luo Tian sighed, his gaze filled with helplessness: “Kid, I’m your real father!”

“You say that too! You can kill me, but don’t insult my father!” Luo Tian’s eyes were resolute.

“Haha…” Sun Kerenian laughed until he cried, his laughter echoing.

“You little bastard!” Luo Tian was furious, his hand swinging to strike Luo Li’s head—but without force.

“I said you can insult me, but not my father! And don’t call me a little bastard—it’s insulting my father. When my uncles find me, they’ll beat your mouth off!” Luo Li continued, his composure undisturbed. He sensed no killing intent from the two.

“Ah…” Luo Tian was truly exasperated, speechless as he pointed to seal Luo Li. He lifted him and flew toward the Fire Domain’s Tongtian Mountain, where a portal to the Divine and Demon Domain awaited.

“Cover your appearance,” Sun Kerenian said, his face grave as he watched Luo Tian’s fierce aura. “Now the Nine Domains are stable, at least on the surface. If you appear suddenly, it’ll become unstable. That would lower your prestige.”

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, retrieving the Thousand Mirage Mask to transform into a middle-aged man. His aura changed dramatically.

“Surely not your father!” Luo Li glared at the transformed Luo Tian, snorting. He had almost believed it.

“Shut up, kid! If you speak again, I’ll think your father will slap you to death. Come on, Uncle will help you with makeup!” Sun Kerenian waved his hands, drawing light onto Luo Li’s face.

Chapter 1377: Shaking the Yin Yang Sect

“Alright!” Sun Kerenian clapped his hands, light scattering as a beautiful young woman appeared before Luo Tian.

“…”

Luo Tian was speechless, staring at the transformed Luo Li—only to glare at Sun Kerenian.

But he said nothing, as the kid had truly infuriated him.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Li, unaware of Sun Kerenian’s tricks, asked with confusion.

“Don’t speak!” Sun Kerenian pointed his finger, sealing Luo Li before he could talk.

“Let’s go!” Sun Kerenian wiped his face, changing his appearance as he spoke to Luo Tian.

The two carried Luo Li and flew swiftly toward the Fire Domain’s Tongtian Mountain, where a portal awaited.

The mountain now radiated power, having become the Fire Domain’s top sect after merging with the original three Daoist sects. The Sea of Mountains Sect and the Crimson Flame Temple had merged with Tongtian Gate, greatly enhancing the Fire Domain’s strength.

Luo Tian’s spiritual sense swept through Tongtian Gate, spotting old friends—Lu Tianyu had become the sect’s top genius, his strength unrecognizable. Du Yuying was also there, her happiness evident as she stood with Lu Tianyu on the mountain cliff.

“Finally together!” Luo Tian smiled, watching their happy faces.

“Hmm?” As Lu Tianyu’s spiritual sense touched them, his face shifted slightly, his gaze filled with confusion.

“What’s wrong?” Du Yuying sensed Lu Tianyu’s tension and asked.

“I felt a familiar presence sweep over us—strong!” Lu Tianyu frowned, his eyes flashing with intensity.

“Who?” Du Yuying’s face turned cautious, no longer the lively girl she once was.
