Cunning individuals would not find it difficult to deduce that one who could freely enter and exit the location where Jifeng Valley's disciples were detained must hold a high position. Thus, it was evident that there was a traitor within Jifeng Valley who had rescued the two.

“Brother, stay safe on your journey! Let’s meet again in Xian Gu Yi Di!” Zheng Xin stepped forward, clapping hands with Luo Tian. He knew that after returning, Luo Tian would head back to the Northern Domain.

“Take care yourself!” Luo Tian patted Zheng Xin’s shoulder, his face filled with sentiment. Among the Eastern Domain, he had only a few friends; parting now left him quite reluctant.

As for Yang Family’s grandfather and grandson, there was no need for him to worry; with Dan Sect and Jifeng Valley’s two sects, Luo Tian could not offer much help.

After exchanging pleasantries, Zheng Tianxiao and Zheng Bowen also bid farewell to Luo Tian. Under the gaze of the Yang family father and son, Duan Chencheng and Leng Hongcai led their disciples onto the back of the Flying Dragon.

Meanwhile, Dan Yongfu, under the teary eyes of Dan Yuyan, climbed onto the Flying Dragon’s back. His eyes glistened with tears.

“Roar…” The dragon let out a deep cry, soaring into the sky. The three-day Flying Dragon flew in three different directions.

…

Leng Hongcai stood on the dragon’s back, white yuan energy swirling around him. He spoke softly: “Have you decided? Won’t you say goodbye to Jiang Nanxuan?”

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s name, Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with light. He thought of this extraordinary man; among all the people he had ever respected, Jiang Nanxuan was one.

“No need. Just take me to the teleportation array,” Luo Tian smiled, knowing that even if he didn’t go, Jiang Nanxuan and the others would not cause trouble. After all, he wasn’t leaving the Eastern Domain; there would be plenty of chances in the future.

“Fine, remember: you are the Young Master of Yuling Sect. If you face any trouble, Yuling Sect will defend you,” Leng Hongcai said softly.

Luo Tian nodded gently, his gaze lingering on Leng Qiuchan seated in the distance without speaking further.

“Roar…” After three days of flight, the dragon finally reached Yuling Sect, letting out a low cry before circling above it.

“Go,” Leng Hongcai said softly.

Luo Tian looked down from the sky, seeing a massive array formed by hundreds of阵旗 (array flags) in his line of sight.

He gazed one last time at Leng Qiuchan before pushing off the dragon’s back, plummeting like a spear toward the ground.

Chapter 494: Teleportation ()

Chapter 494: Teleportation

As Luo Tian leapt off the dragon’s back, Leng Qiuchan’s eyes welled with tears.

“Alas…” Leng Hongcai sighed softly, his gaze filled with pity for his daughter.

As a father, he knew his daughter’s feelings well. Yet, at the Wind and Thunder Platform, he had publicly announced that Leng Qiuchan would be betrothed to Luo Tian. However, Luo Tian had not responded.

After this period of coexistence, Leng Hongcai had come to understand Luo Tian somewhat. If Luo Tian did not respond, it meant a refusal.

“Father, I’m taking Xiao Lang to the Shili Cave!” Leng Qiuchan opened her eyes, a determined expression on her face.

Hearing this, the surrounding Yuling Sect disciples wore expressions of shock, and Leng Hongcai’s face shifted slightly.

“Have you decided?” Leng Hongcai asked again.

Leng Qiuchan nodded, her lips curling slightly as she whispered: “I can’t let him outpace me, can I?”

“Good,” Leng Hongcai’s face showed a decisive expression. His daughter was someone he knew well—once she made up her mind, she never changed it.

The dragon circled and landed on Yuling Sect’s main peak. Leng Qiuchan did not hesitate, returning to her quarters, grabbing Xiao Lang who was being tended by Yuling Sect disciples, and heading toward the back mountains of Yuling Gate.

…

Three hundred li away from Yuling Sect, Luo Tian’s feet slammed into the ground with a grin. Around him, several Soul-Formation Realm elders saw someone descending from the sky and wore expressions of tension.

Upon recognizing Luo Tian, their faces softened into smiles. Though Luo Tian had not been at Yuling Sect for long, he was a Young Master and had been personally selected by the sect’s patriarch. This meant his status was no less than these elders.

“Respectful Master, are you heading to the Northern Domain?” One elder asked with a smile.

“Thank you, elders,” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to the surrounding elders, his expression one of reverence. He could sense their formidable presence.

Luo Tian silently nodded in approval; the strength of Eastern Domain sects far surpassed that of the Northern Domain. These masters could easily serve as patriarchs in top-tier Northern Domain sects.

“Please produce the sect’s official seal, Master,” the elders said with warm smiles. “We cannot break protocol.”

Luo Tian extended a jade slip to the lead elder, his respect undiminished.

“Respectful Master, proceed,” the elder said after inspecting it.

Luo Tian thanked him and walked toward the array’s center—the sole teleportation array leading to the Northern Domain. Yuling Sect rarely activated it; the last time was when Leng Qiuchan had sneaked out, earning several elders punishment.

Luo Tian stood at the array’s center, his face showing hesitation. After all, this was his first time using a teleportation array, though he had been moved several times before. He found the experience quite memorable; in his view, teleportation arrays were no better than long-distance movement.

“Respectful Master need not worry; this array, though ancient, is perfectly safe and can accommodate dozens or even hundreds of people at once,” the elders said gently, sensing Luo Tian’s hesitation.

“Latecomer is ready. Thank you, elders,” Luo Tian nodded to the elders.

The elders’ hands moved swiftly. Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the lead elder said nothing more, raising a golden array flag and placing it at the array’s core.

“Wum…” As the flag descended, a powerful surge enveloped Luo Tian, causing his face to shift.

Luo Tian vanished from the elders’ sight.

At the same time, Leng Qiuchan led Xiao Lang to a cave mouth. Roars echoed from within the cave, making Xiao Lang’s blue wolf fur bristle and his eyes flicker with fear as he trembled slightly.

“Let’s go,” Leng Qiuchan said resolutely, pulling the reluctant Xiao Lang into the cave.

…

Northern Domain, Feiyan City.

As the only location in the Northern Domain with a teleportation array, Feiyan City was naturally bustling. Even after the three-year turmoil caused by the Tianshi Sect, Feiyan City had not suffered much. The reason remained unknown.

Unlike the Eastern Domain’s closed nature, the Northern Domain allowed travel to other regions by paying a fee of yuan energy stones.

However, the Eastern Domain was an exception; Yuling Sect had closed its teleportation array, opening it only during special occasions—such as Luo Tian’s current journey.

“Hmph?” A surge rippled through the teleportation array heading to the Eastern Domain.

“Someone from the Eastern Domain has teleported through?”

“Who is it? Such a person must hold high status,” people murmured, intrigued.

“Recently, the Eastern Domain’s teleportation array has been opening frequently. A few days ago, the head of Wuxing Sect’s Dan Pavilion also teleported to the Eastern Domain and returned!” Observing the yuan energy fluctuations, people wore curious expressions, waiting.

“Wum…” Under their expectant gazes, Luo Tian stood on the teleportation array, dazed.

“Such a young man!”

“He seems familiar!” As soon as Luo Tian appeared, people murmured.

Luo Tian glanced around, stepping onto the ground with a sigh of relief. For years, this was his first time feeling so comfortable during teleportation.

He sensed the surrounding yuan energy and grinned broadly, confirming this was indeed the Northern Domain—its density of yuan energy was unmistakable.

Seeing people staring at him like a monster, Luo Tian furrowed his brows in confusion, glancing down at his attire. Finding nothing amiss, he furrowed his brows slightly.

Ignoring the stares around him, Luo Tian walked out of the teleportation array toward the crowd’s edge. He truly missed home, but he knew this place was Feiyan City. With his speed, a day’s journey would take him to Wuxing Sect.

He did not wish to draw too much attention in the city, as Soul-Formation Realm masters were rare in the Northern Domain. Luo Tian planned to fly after leaving Feiyan City.

Under people’s gazes, Luo Tian slowly stepped out of the crowd toward the direction of the city gates in his mind.

“Hey, kid! You’re back! Didn’t you know entering the Northern Domain requires yuan energy stones?” As soon as Luo Tian stepped out of the crowd, a discordant voice echoed in his ears.

He turned around, eyes filled with confusion as he looked at several men who seemed to be guards.

Luo Tian truly hadn’t known entering the Northern Domain required yuan energy stones, but he soon understood. After all, teleportation arrays weren’t free. He smiled and bowed: “I’m new to using teleportation arrays; please forgive my ignorance.”

Chapter 495: Giving a Face, Not Taking It ()

Seeing Luo Tian’s amiable demeanor, the lead middle-aged man ignored him and coldly said: “Since you don’t know the rules, today is forgiven. Hand over the yuan energy stones—thirty thousand!”

Seeing these men approach, onlookers around them wore expressions of hatred and quickly distanced themselves.

This sight made Luo Tian’s brows furrow slightly. His mood was quite good, and he didn’t wish to stir up trouble; thirty thousand yuan energy stones were not much for him.

“Thirty thousand it is,” Luo Tian chuckled, raising his hand to retrieve the yuan energy stones.

Hearing this, people were astonished. This young man truly had money; thirty thousand yuan energy stones could be spent so easily. A fool could see these middle-aged men were overcharging.

Those familiar with these men knew they had long exploited their positions to siphon resources.

“Haha… found a fat sheep!” The men exchanged glances, eyes communicating silently as they awaited Luo Tian to produce the yuan energy stones and plotted how to squeeze more from him.

However, soon after, Luo Tian regretted it, standing awkwardly with a flushed face. He suddenly remembered his pockets were empty.

“Clang…” A dozen yuan energy stones fell to the ground, emitting faint yuan energy.

“Young man, are you mocking us?” The middle-aged man’s face turned red with anger, shouting. His companions’ faces also showed fury, clenching fists and preparing to fight.

Luo Tian awkwardly picked up the dozen yuan energy stones, momentarily stunned. He then waved his hand again, and a Xuan-ranked初级 (early-stage) long sword materialized in his hand.

This sword, he had no idea where it came from; all the items his mother Zhang Qiuyue gave him, he had not used a single one—only wearing an inner armor that was destroyed by the Bijing Lirui Fire.

At the moment this Xuan-ranked sword appeared, people’s faces showed astonishment. Though Feiyan City was richer than other places, its weapons and elixirs were not much better than others—these items were priceless.

“Respectful elder, does this sword suffice for thirty thousand yuan energy stones?” Luo Tian smiled, offering the sword to the middle-aged man.

This Xuan-ranked sword could fetch over a hundred thousand yuan energy stones at an auction.

“Sufficient…” The middle-aged man almost instinctively said “sufficient,” but his companion pulled him back, whispering in his ear.

Upon hearing his companion’s words, the middle-aged man’s eyes lit up with greed, carefully concealing it.

Luo Tian’s perception was extraordinary; he heard every word the man spoke clearly, causing his lips to curl slightly with a cold expression.

“Cough…,” The middle-aged man grabbed the sword, his joy flashing briefly before he coughed and shouted:

“A broken sword wants to substitute for thirty thousand yuan energy stones? You’re dreaming. This broken sword is worth at most one thousand yuan energy stones! Considering you’re new to the Northern Domain, I’ll give you a discount. Produce fifteen more swords of this kind or weapons and the matter will be settled!” The middle-aged man’s face showed disdain.

Hearing this, people around him wore angry expressions, cursing the middle-aged man for his shamelessness but no one dared to speak out.

Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly without speaking. With a wave of his hand, he hurled dozens of Xuan-ranked treasures to the ground, saying softly: “Here are thirty Xuan-ranked treasures. Dare you take them?”

Thirty Xuan-ranked treasures emitted waves, dazzling people’s eyes. Each was priceless.

Seeing the thirty-plus Xuan-ranked treasures on the ground, the middle-aged men’s eyes widened in shock. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so wealthy.

But then, recalling Luo Tian’s words, their faces showed disdain: “A mere Xuan-ranked treasure—what fear do I have?”

As they spoke, the middle-aged man’s late-stage Bone-Body aura suddenly condensed toward Luo Tian, while his four companions’ mid-stage Bone-Body auras erupted to suppress Luo Tian, fearing he might retract the treasures.

The middle-aged men approached Luo Tian’s front, their minds clouded by greed, reaching to grab the treasures on the ground.

But as soon as they touched the Xuan-ranked treasures, they all emitted a humming sound and vanished before their eyes.

“Die!”
“Young man, dare to mock us!” The middle-aged man’s face turned red with fury, shouting. Without the sword being taken, it instantly slashed toward Luo Tian.

“Crack…” Under people’s astonished gazes, the sword emitted ten thousand lights and fiercely struck Luo Tian, producing a crisp sound.

To people’s surprise, there was no bloodshed as expected; instead, the Xuan-ranked初级 sword shattered and fell to the ground.

“You…,” The middle-aged man and his companions finally realized, their faces bewildered. They couldn’t fathom that their furious strike had not harmed this seemingly frail young man at all.

After all, they were late-stage Bone-Body masters; their full-force strike would have harmed even a peak Bone-Body master. Yet this young man remained unscathed, leaving the middle-aged men stunned.

“Still, I don’t want to give it!” Luo Tian sighed softly, the sword on the ground flying back into his hand.

A streak of emerald fire wrapped around the sword, and under people’s trembling gazes, it slowly melted into a golden droplet the size of a fist.

“Encountered a tough one!” At this point, if the middle-aged man didn’t realize Luo Tian was no pushover, he would truly be a fool. He stood stunned, unsure of what to do.

“Originally, I was in high spirits after returning to the Northern Domain. But you insisted on giving me a headache!” Luo Tian’s face showed a cold smile, speaking softly.

“Elder, mercy!” The middle-aged man fell to his knees and begged for mercy, sensing that if he touched the green fire in Luo Tian’s hand, he would be reduced to ashes. It was a tremor from the soul.

“Seems you’ve done this many times before. Since I’m back in the Northern Domain, I don’t wish to kill anyone. I’ll erase your cultivation and let you live on your own!” Luo Tian said, then flicked his finger. Five Bijing Lirui Fires appeared instantly and shot into the five men’s dantian.

“Ah…” As the fires entered their bodies, the five men fell to the ground, howling in agony.

Luo Tian didn’t even glance at them again, walking out of the crowd under people’s reverent gazes.

Chapter 496: Revisiting Old Ground ()

Luo Tian’s face showed coldness as he exited the city gate. Feeling time had passed enough, he activated his spiritual sense; five green flames leapt from the five men’s bodies, merging into a radiant light that returned to Luo Tian’s body.

“My dantian is destroyed!” The five men continuously sweat, their eyes filled with terror as they gazed at the distance.

Hearing their cries, people probed their bodies. This probe was no small matter; people’s faces showed great shock.

In their spiritual senses, the five middle-aged men’s dantians had turned into blackened voids.

“Should…”
“Waste them well!” People shouted loudly, no longer fearing the five men. They all cheered, with several Bone-Body masters showing fierce expressions and slowly approaching the five men.

Seeing this situation, people wore amused expressions; the five men had accumulated too much resentment in Feiyan City. Now that their cultivation was erased, it was certain those they had wronged would not hold back.

Luo Tian did not continue to care about the five men’s fates. Exiting Feiyan City, his wings suddenly spread open, a sense of nostalgia washing over him as he flew through the sky.

Now in the Northern Domain, after the previous Tianshi Sect incident, both sects and secular realms had suffered greatly. After three years of rest, they had finally recovered some vitality.

Luo Tian’s heart was unusually calm as he gazed at the grass and trees beneath him.

Soon, Luo Tian reached the town where he had once ambushed the Tianshi Sect. The town was gradually regaining its vitality; Luo Tian still vividly remembered the battle three years ago.

At that time, secular people seemed to have forgotten the battle entirely, continuing their mundane lives. Seeing this, Luo Tian felt a longing for such ordinary days.

After half a day, Luo Tian finally reached the sky above Tianyuan City, smiling. Tianyuan City was where he had begun his rise.

His spiritual sense encompassed the city, revealing everything within Luo Tian’s perception.

At that moment, Wang Family had become the top family in Tianyuan City; Wang Pengtian was a late-stage Bone-Body master. Luo Tian was surprised to find that Wang Tianxiang was also in the Wang Family, though his face showed urgency and eagerness as he looked at Wang Pengtian.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly, then his ears twitched as he listened to their conversation.

“Father, don’t be stubborn—leave!” Wang Tianxiang’s face showed urgency as he looked at Wang Pengtian, completely unaware of Luo Tian’s presence.

“Hmph… don’t think about it. This Tianyuan City is the Wang Family’s place. We’ve lived here for generations. My decision is final. You must leave with the family’s men, women, and children; I’ll stay to guard the Wang Family. To destroy me, they must step over my corpse!” Wang Pengtian’s face showed anger as he scolded.

“Fine, I’ll stay with you. There are three days left; I’ll see how Wu Lao’er destroys us!” Wang Tianxiang’s face showed guilt, his gaze resolute toward Wang Pengtian.

“No, you must leave. The Wang Family cannot be without a successor. You also have no choice but to do this; it’s Wu Family who has overstepped!” Wang Pengtian scolded loudly.

“Three days?” Luo Tian didn’t care about the two fathers’ quarrel, smiling slightly.

In his spiritual sense, Gu Family’s address showed no signs of destruction, and within the Gu Family courtyard stood several servants cleaning it. Especially in the center of the courtyard stood a lifelike statue.

Luo Tian had become a legend in Tianyuan City; everyone knew the Gu Family had produced an extraordinary figure—over twenty years old, who had shone brilliantly in the battle against the Tianshi Sect.

Luo Tian now held two Xuan-ranked high-grade weapons, tossing them toward the two men. These weapons were personally crafted by his mother Zhang Qiuyue and were stronger than ordinary Xuan-ranked high-grade weapons.

No need to mention that the Wang Family and Gu Family had always maintained good relations; Wang Pengtian had never let Luo Tian down. Plus, with Wang Tianxiang as an adopted nephew, the Wang Family had preserved the Gu Family’s old courtyard. Luo Tian would help with this matter.

Though Luo Tian felt he still had shortcomings, such secular family disputes were manageable for him. Even second-rate sects without a Rebirth-Stage master could not intimidate him.

While the Wang Family’s father and son were arguing, they suddenly heard a humming sound from above. They turned their heads toward the sky.

A hammer and a long sword, like two meteors, crashed heavily before them with a heavy sound.

“Who is it? Is it Wu Family?” Wang Pengtian’s face turned pale, looking toward the distance.

“I am Luo Tian. Two days later, I’ll return. These two Xuan-ranked high-grade weapons will help you in case of emergencies! Remember, life is the most important!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in their ears, causing them to show joy.

“Luo Tian!”
“Auntie?” They both exclaimed in unison, exchanging glances and seeing joy in each other’s eyes.

“Haha… the heavens have not forsaken my Wang Family!” Wang Pengtian laughed loudly, his voice filled with excitement.

“Didn’t they say your auntie died?” Wang Tianxiang, as a disciple of the Crazy Knife Sect, had heard rumors that Luo Tian was dead and asked in confusion.

“That kid is powerful; how could he die? I don’t know who spread the rumor!” Wang Pengtian felt at ease.

To him, Luo Tian was omnipotent. Three years ago, he had already been formidable; with the Wuxing Sect as a pillar, if Luo Tian helped the Wang Family, it would be whether they were destroyed or if they chose to retaliate! Wang Pengtian’s face showed excitement but did not stop the Wang Family from evacuating.

Luo Tian sensed Wang Pengtian and Wang Tianxiang’s changes in the sky, smiling slightly before flying toward Feiyun Sect.

Along the way, Luo Tian flew for another half a day before reaching Feiyun Sect, his face showing nostalgia.

Luo Tian did not directly land on the mountain peak but descended to its base, walking up Feiyun Mountain.

Seeing the surroundings had not changed much from three years ago, Luo Tian’s face showed sentimentality. After walking for half a day, he finally reached the mountain gate of Feiyun Sect.

The gatekeepers were no longer the same as three years ago but had become two young men with fresh faces.

“Stop! What are you doing?” Seeing Luo Tian approaching the gate, the gatekeepers shouted.

Chapter 497: Provocation ()

Seeing their appearances, Luo Tian said nothing and spoke softly: “Luo Tian, here to pay respects at Feiyun Sect. Please allow it!”

“Luo Tian?”
“How familiar…” The two disciples exchanged glances, muttering.

Seeing Luo Tian’s calm demeanor, they knew he was not easy to provoke. They had seen many people come to Feiyun Sect for apprenticeship before, and they all respected him humbly. Some even trembled in fear.

Though these two disciples had not high cultivation, they were at the seventh stage of Body-Refining and their pressure was unbearable for ordinary people.

“Wait, I’ll go report!” One young disciple said and turned toward Feiyun Sect.

“No need,” Luo Tian smiled softly.

“Luo Tian, where is he?” People surged forward as disciples from Feiyun Sect came out one by one.

Nan Gong Xiu walked at the front with a helpless expression, followed by Yu Pengfei and other elders. Behind them were Feiyun Sect disciples.

The two gatekeepers were stunned, seeing the sect’s master Nan Gong Xiu and his disciples. Any one of them was beyond what they could normally see.

“Who is this man? Luo Tian?”
“Luo Tian!” They kept repeating the name, then suddenly realized and stared wide-eyed at Luo Tian before tremblingly withdrawing their fingers.

Luo Tian ignored the two young men’s actions, smiling kindly at those who had approached him.

Feiyun Sect disciples also gradually came out of the sect, some recognizing Luo Tian with expressions of hostility.

Luo Tian rubbed his nose awkwardly, smiling: “Master Nan Gong, it’s been a while!”

“Why have you come to Feiyun Sect again?” Nan Gong Xiu’s face showed helplessness, patting his head.

Every time Luo Tian came, Feiyun Sect disciples became unusually agitated. Though they had calmed down over these days, the tragedy at Feiyun Sect’s mountain gate three years ago remained a stigma in their hearts. This made them more united and determined to cultivate.

Nan Gong Xiu didn’t know if this was good or bad, but now that Luo Tian had arrived at Feiyun Sect, he knew it was not a good situation.

“Luo Tian, you dare to come back to Feiyun Sect? Do you think of it as your backyard?” Nan Gong Xiu’s back, several late-stage Bone-Body disciples stepped forward with provocative expressions. These five were the rising stars of Feiyun Sect over these three years.

Luo Tian saw these young men and felt a sense of familiarity, recalling how Feiyun Sect disciples had looked at him with fear three years ago. Now that fear had faded.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian nodded, his tone carrying a paternal air as he looked at these young men of similar age to himself.

“Stop acting! I don’t believe you could enter the Soul-Formation Realm in just three years. If you haven’t, then you’re not our match. Dare to fight us!” Five young men showed battle spirit and shouted loudly.

They were excited, not feeling ashamed of surrounding him. If anyone mocked them, they would shout back: “Who could fight a monster without surrounding?”

But if they defeated Luo Tian, their fame would spread throughout the Northern Domain and become heroes of Feiyun Sect.

Luo Tian chuckled slightly. Not only was he now at the peak of Bone-Body, but even a late-stage Bone-Body master would not look down on these five. Now, they were like children wanting to fight an adult—Luo Tian was the adult and even more powerful.

He didn’t wish to argue with them, so he maintained a calm smile without responding to their provocation. He addressed Nan Gong Xiu: “Master Nan Gong, I’ve come to pay respects to Yun Ting. There’s no other intention. I don’t wish for any conflict with Feiyun Sect disciples. Please allow it!”

“Everyone, step back!” Nan Gong Xiu shouted softly. He could sense Luo Tian’s strength; though he had not released any aura, the feeling of stillness like a pool of water was there. But once he unleashed it, it would become a flood. Even Nan Gong Xiu felt a sense of fear.

“Master!” Several disciples showed reluctance but had to obey Nan Gong Xiu’s orders, their faces flushed red as they retreated to the back of the crowd.

“Go,” Nan Gong Xiu sighed, “let Yu Pengfei Elder take you. After finishing your business, leave quickly!” He smiled slightly but was actually eager to talk with Luo Tian and ease the relationship between him and Feiyun Sect.

However, seeing his disciples’ eyes, he shook his head slightly. He couldn’t be sure what Feiyun Sect disciples would do.

“Luo Tian, it’s been a while!” Yu Pengfei smiled with emotion, his aura of Soul-Formation Realm emerging from behind Nan Gong Xiu.

Yu Pengfei had more interactions with Luo Tian and could clearly sense his changes over the past three years. Luo Tian was once young and brash, but now he seemed more gentle.

“Master Yu Pengfei, it’s been a while. Congratulations on entering the Soul-Formation Realm! I don’t have much to offer, but this five-star elixir is a token of my respect!” Luo Tian flicked his finger, and a jade bottle floated toward Yu Pengfei.

“Five… five-star elixir!” Feiyun Sect disciples showed shock; five-star elixirs were rare in the Northern Domain.

“Consolidate your cultivation, Master Yu. I noticed your cultivation is unstable—clearly you’ve just broken through!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Ah…” Hearing this, Yu Pengfei felt awkward. He had just passed the Soul-Formation trial half a year ago, slightly earlier than Luo Tian.

Yu Pengfei didn’t refuse; he knew Luo Tian was a cultivator and had plenty of elixirs. The elixirs Luo Tian left for Feiyun Sect were still not fully distributed by the sect’s resource managers.

The situation seemed to repeat itself, with Luo Tian and Yu Pengfei walking into Feiyun Sect under the disciples’ angry gazes.

“Go!” Several young men, faces filled with anger, followed the two behind them.

Luo Tian and his group easily reached the cemetery. The gravekeeper still leisurely sat on a chair, his hat covering his face as he lazily fanned himself, seemingly unaware of Luo Tian’s arrival.

But Luo Tian knew this frail-looking elder was terrifying; even now, as he stepped into the cemetery, a chill ran down his neck.

Chapter 498: Half a Promise ()

Luo Tian respectfully bowed to the gravekeeper, saying: “Under the Master’s command, I’ve come with Wuxing Sect disciples to pay respects to Feiyun Sect disciple Chen Yunting.”

“Again? Go, follow the old rules!” The gravekeeper removed his hat, gazing at Luo Tian with dull eyes before closing them again.

Knowing the elder didn’t wish to speak much, Yu Pengfei led Luo Tian deeper into Feiyun Sect’s cemetery. Soon they found Chen Yunting’s small tomb.

Seeing the familiar tombstone, Luo Tian’s face showed sorrow again. He knelt down to pull out weeds before gently brushing the tombstone, his face showing tenderness.

Behind him, Feiyun Sect disciples were also infected by this sorrowful atmosphere and stood there silently. However, a few exceptions exchanged glances with determination.

“Swoosh…” They shot forward like arrows, taking advantage of the moment people were stunned to attack Luo Tian.

Their speed was too fast, and they took advantage of the moment people were stunned. Even Yu Pengfei hadn’t expected them to act here. When he realized, they were already at Luo Tian’s front.

Each of the five men brandished their weapons and slashed toward Luo Tian’s back, but Luo Tian seemed unaware and continued to gently brush the tombstone.

“Be careful!” Yu Pengfei shouted, warning Luo Tian.

But soon after, he felt disappointed; their weapons had already landed on Luo Tian’s back.

Many Feiyun Sect disciples closed their eyes, believing that these five men were strong enough to overpower Luo Tian. Though Luo Tian was formidable in their eyes, they still felt he wasn’t a match for the five of them.

“Pang…” No bloodied scene as expected, but instead the five men scattered and flew back, falling to the ground with expressions of disbelief.

Luo Tian ignored them and continued brushing the stone, then waved his hand to retrieve a jade bottle. His fingers moved, leaving imprints on the bottle.

“Wum…” As the imprints flew out of his hand, the bottle emitted a humming sound. The bottle trembled in front of Luo Tian.

“Come out!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a fierce expression, and he slapped the bottle, shattering it.

A blood-red essence immediately filled the cemetery with a bloody scent. This was Li Xiuping’s escaped essence, captured by Luo Tian and sealed in the bottle. This time, Luo Tian had come to pay respects to Chen Yunting, with the main purpose of completely erasing Li Xiuping’s last chance at survival.

Though sealed for this period, Li Xiuping had never stopped thinking of escaping and was constantly recovering. Finally, he had regained some strength.

As soon as it appeared, Li Xiuping’s essence transformed into a red light and rushed toward the distance. He naturally knew that with his current state, he was no match for Luo Tian and even burned the last drop of essence to sustain his life.
