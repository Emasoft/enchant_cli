“No! The Epoch Bell’s nine strikes mark the beginning of this era, and the Nine Domains will face a new great upheaval. The Shadow Domain is too powerful; if left unchecked, the other domains will lose their lineage. For instance, the Four Sacred Star Domains—had I not misjudged, they have had no one enter the ancient heavenly palace twice. This time, their strength is the weakest of all. If no unexpected changes occur, this Four Sacred Star Domains will perish. Even the other domains are in danger. Though this era may endure, the next will surely be devoured by the Shadow Domain.”

Hearing the old man’s words, eighteen individuals fell silent. These eighteen hailed from various domains, excluding only the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Shadow Domain.

The eighteen trusted the old man’s words completely. Since they had entered the ancient heavenly palace, they had frequently interacted with him, and he always brought them news. Though they did not know if it was true, after years of coexistence, they had come to understand him thoroughly. They knew the old man was not a deceitful person.

“Enough. This time, not only will the Epoch Bell be released, but also the Bloodthirsty Demon Sword and the Celestial Mechanism Map. Even the entire heavenly palace may have a master!” The old man spoke, his voice calm yet causing thunderous echoes in the hearts of the eighteen.

“What!” The three Supreme Sages, masters at the peak of their power, suddenly stood up. Their eyes flashed like lightning as they stared at the old man, voices laced with disbelief.

The entire hall erupted in movement; all present stood abruptly, their breaths quickened as they gazed at the old man with expressions of shock.

“Don’t look at me like that. This is what ‘he’ said—it’s only a possibility. Ultimately, it depends on his decision. After all, I am merely a second-tier guardian!” The old man spread his hands, a faint air of helplessness on his face as he met the eighteen’s eyes, which seemed to want to devour him.

“Then how is the selection done? Among us or among these newcomers?” One of them spoke, a powerful figure from the Flame Domain—the only one present from that domain.

“I’ve already said I don’t know! It all depends on his will. I’m just saying it’s about fate!” The old man smiled, genuinely unaware of the answer.

“Hmph. If this heavenly palace has a master, who in the Nine Domains would dare provoke him!” The eighteen’s eyes gleamed with excitement. They had a high chance of obtaining the ancient heavenly palace.

Others did not know the terror of the ancient heavenly palace, but they did. This place was far stronger than external rumors suggested. Even a Supreme Sage at the peak would perish upon encountering it. Didn’t they see that two Supreme Sages had remained seated and never left?

The eighteen could no longer remain calm. They began to murmur among themselves, but after long years of coexistence, they had no more divisions. They were like a single family, without barriers or distinctions.

As the eighteen debated fervently, the third-level hall of the ancient heavenly palace was a scene of utter carnage. All were mad, killing anyone they encountered. Only a few remained lucid but were eventually surrounded and slain.

Corpses lay scattered, instantly turning into bleached bones. Blood floated in the air, further inciting people’s ferocity.

Luotian was drenched in blood, his companion Xu Liyi equally battered. They dodged and slashed toward Xiu’s direction. Earlier, their speed had been too fast; Luotian had only managed to intercept Xu Liyi. Next moment, they dispersed.

Du Hong and Lu Han Tian followed Xu Liyi’s back, forming a triangle with Luotian to shield him. They surged forward like an arrow toward Xiu’s direction.

Xiu had been hidden in the void but was forced out by the chaos. His body was battered, and he too fought like a madman, clashing with anyone without fear—even Supreme Sages at the initial stage.

After slaying over a dozen half-Supreme Sages and one Supreme Sage at the initial stage, Luotian finally reached Xiu, who was wounded.

Xiu’s face was pale with madness, still attacking a Supreme Sage at the initial stage. The result was obvious; it was a miracle he hadn’t died before Luotian arrived.

“Get out…” Luotian’s spear shot forward, a golden storm that repelled the Supreme Sage. He approached Xiu and touched his body with golden spiritual energy, dispelling the bloodlust within him.

“Cough… cough…” Xiu’s face was deathly pale, his body riddled with wounds. After regaining clarity, he spat out several mouthfuls of blood and gazed at Luotian.

“Brother, come here!” Xu Liyi pulled Xiu in front of him, a faint smile on his face.

“No need!” Xiu’s expression was resolute. Previously, Luotian had protected him, but he hadn’t felt the desperation of life or death. Though his mind was hazy earlier, it had given him a familiar sensation. His eyes now held confidence, and he looked around before settling on the Supreme Sage at the initial stage.

As Xiu regained clarity, he vanished through space and appeared before the mad Supreme Sage. His black sword turned into a glint of coldness, piercing the Supreme Sage’s body.

“Go!” Luotian chuckled and led the three back into the fray toward Tian Luo.

“Awaken!” He touched Tian Luo, restoring his clarity. Tian Luo had made the same choice as Xu Liyi; he did not choose Luotian’s protection.

Diao Dezhu, Chen Zhanbiao, and all of Luotian’s friends were awakened by him. However, two of them chose not to continue fighting but joined Luotian’s group.

Five people moved like an arrow through the bloodstained battlefield, their crimson auras growing stronger.

As for Nan Gong Yuqing, Luotian did not interfere. These days, he had been repressed too long; now he fought against Nan Gong Feibai. The terrifying fluctuations spread outward, unlike a half-Supreme Sage’s battle.

“Eclipse the Heavens!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s eyes turned blood-red but still retained a sliver of clarity. He roared, and nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine blood-red swords pierced the heavens, absorbing the battlefield’s blood energy. This amplified the power of “Eclipse the Heavens,” even stunning Luotian.

“Enter madness!” The blood energy reversed, and Nan Gong Yuqing did not pause. His aura surged again, transforming the blood energy into black demonic qi, elevating his power to nearly Supreme Sage initial stage.

“Roar…” Nan Gong Feibai, the Demon Clan’s prince, was undeniably powerful. He faced Nan Gong Yuqing’s “Eclipse the Heavens” without fear. Though his body was infiltrated by bloodlust, he still retained a sliver of clarity. His demonic qi enveloped his body like an ancient demon lord, and a black spear descended from the sky, crashing into Nan Gong Yuqing’s “Eclipse the Heavens.”

The thunderous collision shook the heavens. The terrifying fluctuations annihilated all superiors and beasts around them.

“Those by Luotian’s side are no ordinary people!” Zhou Wei’s eyes flashed with amazement as he watched Nan Gong Yuqing and Nan Gong Feibai’s battle.

“Who is that kid? He was unremarkable by Luotian’s side before, yet he possesses the strength to challenge a Demon Clan prince!” The divine clan group, their bodies glowing with divine light, eyes flashing golden rays like deities. They were untouched by blood energy and watched Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Probably has a close connection with the Demon Clan!” Sun Feiwen’s face was grave. Previously, they had only focused on Luotian. Now, with Chen Zhanbiao and Long Jie’s shock, and now Nan Gong Yuqing challenging Nan Gong Feibai, they realized Luotian’s companions were no ordinary people.

The Demon Clan and divine clan coexisting in one domain meant their strength was self-evident. As the Demon Clan’s prince, Nan Gong Feibai’s power needed no explanation. To match him, Nan Gong Yuqing was undeniably strong.

“Luotian’s brilliance is too overwhelming, overshadowing those around him. In truth, those by his side would be top-tier prodigies—princes or divine sons in any major faction.”

Chapter 979: The Death of the Demon

Within the third-level hall of the ancient heavenly palace, bloodstained energy surged violently. Countless warriors fell to the ground, and the Bloodthirsty Demon Sword in the sky emitted eerie red light, absorbing the battlefield’s blood energy.

The ground was littered with corpses, drawn by an unseen force and turned into bleached bones.

Luotian and his group panted heavily after half a day of battle. The hall’s thunderous echoes gradually quieted, leaving only faint tremors in certain areas.

The few remaining stood with bloodstained robes, their eyes carrying exhaustion. Even Luotian was no exception; his gaze held a bitter edge.

“Killing!” Luotian could not recall how many he had slain, only that anyone who provoked them would face their merciless annihilation.

Xiu and Tian Luo stood, their bodies radiating a powerful aura, reminiscent of the top two prodigies from the Southern Domain. Confident and invincible.

They had gained much from this battle, though their strength hadn’t increased. Their minds had been elevated, regaining confidence. Though they wouldn’t admit it, Luotian’s pressure was immense. To be born in the same era as Luotian was both a tragedy and a blessing. With such a formidable goal, their future achievements were boundless—whether they would fall or rise was uncertain.

“Can you get up?” Luotian panted, approaching Xiu and Tian Luo with a smile.

“Can fight ten more!” Xiu and Tian Luo laughed, standing up to accept Luotian’s pills. Their grievous wounds slowly healed.

“Hmph, I didn’t realize you two felt no pain!” Xu Liyi’s face bore admiration as he watched Xiu and Tian Luo.

“Accustomed to it!” Xiu coldly replied, standing among the group with a faint smile.

“Can’t you at least smile? I’ve never seen you laugh before!” Xu Liyi frowned, knowing Xiu’s demeanor for years but not minding it. After all, their friendship was solid.

“No.” Xiu shook his head, attempting a smile but only causing the group to chuckle. This laugh revealed his pale teeth, still stained with blood traces. His face was grotesque, truly embodying the name “Xiu,” a warrior emerging from hell. His smile was more horrifying than crying.

“Stop it, stop it!” Xu Liyi shuddered and patted Xiu’s shoulder, shaking his head.

“Luotian!” Zhou Wei and the Star Domain group, their bodies drenched in blood, slowly approached Luotian’s group. Seeing that Luotian’s group had suffered heavy injuries but no losses, they wore expressions of admiration.

The battle had been brutal; Zhou Wei’s group had fought fiercely, and one misstep cost them two half-Supreme Sages in the third-level hall.

The divine clan was no different; two half-Supreme Sages had perished. Sun Mengru’s face was icy, leading Sun Feiwen and others with a watchful gaze.

Feng Jiutian and the others were grim. The losses in this third-level hall were severe—eleven had entered, but half were lost. Even the young warriors of the Crane and Elephant Clans had fallen here.

The Demon Clan was no better; Nan Gong Feibai’s battle with Nan Gong Yuqing had cost them three lives. Now, only two weak Supreme Sages remained, plus Nan Gong Feibai still clashing with Nan Gong Yuqing.

Another was the unassuming Thunder Domain. Li Maode trembled, his body in tatters, shaking uncontrollably beside a Supreme Sage initial stage elder. They looked pitifully alone.

“Boom…” The void fractured, infinite demonic energy engulfing the hall. Two black masses collided, their black blades slicing through space toward each other.

“Seven Demon Blades of Reversing Heaven!” Luotian’s eyes narrowed, recognizing the blade’s power. He knew Nan Gong Yuqing and Nan Gong Feibai’s battle was nearing its end.

“Ah…” Nan Gong Feibai’s black hair flew wildly, his figure embodying an ancient demon lord. Facing Nan Gong Yuqing’s blade, his black eyes flashed with determination.

“Mass Demon Chaos!” Nan Gong Feibai roared, his demonic energy exploding into countless grotesque figures with sinister smiles. They lunged at the sky-piercing blade.

“Boom…” However, these demonic figures exploded upon contact with the black blade, merging into its power and further amplifying its might.

“Eclipse of the Demon!” Nan Gong Feibai’s face bore disbelief as he watched the blade devour his demonic figures.

The two Demon Clan Supreme Sages’ eyes widened, their mouths gaping as if swallowing a beast. They trembled.

“Eclipse of the Demon! It was said to be lost in the Demon Clan! How could this youth master it!” A divine clan Supreme Sage elder’s eyes flashed with disbelief, whispering.

“An ultimate Dao technique of the Demon Clan, created by their Emperor. It rivals our divine clan’s ancient god-king. Legends say only one Demon Clan leader in history mastered it—the previous elder. This youth’s connection with the Demon Clan must be profound!” The divine clan members’ faces shifted, gazing at Nan Gong Yuqing. Though they had suspected his ties to the Demon Clan, mastering “Eclipse of the Demon” suggested he was likely the previous elder’s disciple.

Luotian’s gaze held admiration, observing the two Demon Clan elders’ expressions. He saw their intense killing intent and felt a chill.

“He was the infant taken by Nan Gong Ming! He still lives. Only Nan Gong Ming knows the “Eclipse of the Demon” technique. We cannot let him live; if he returns to the Demon Clan, it may cause chaos. The elders still dislike the current leader. If this youth returns, his position might be threatened!”

The two elders exchanged silent thoughts, their auras flowing subtly to assist Nan Gong Feibai in eliminating Nan Gong Yuqing.

But as they prepared to move, Luotian’s cold voice echoed through the vast hall: “If you don’t want to die, stay put and watch Nan Gong Feibai be killed!”

The Demon Clan elders halted, their gazes shifting to Luotian. They suddenly realized Nan Gong Yuqing was not alone—behind him stood Luotian, Lu Han Tian, and Diao Dezhu, three Supreme Sages initial stage. If a fight broke out, they would be no match.

“Divine clan friends, the Demon Clan and divine clan are now allied. This youth was the boy taken by Nan Gong Ming. Please assist us in eliminating this Demon Clan traitor!” The two elders knew they couldn’t match Luotian’s group and sought the divine clan’s help, for the divine clan had also been involved in those events.

The three divine clan Supreme Sages’ brows furrowed slightly as they gazed at Nan Gong Yuqing.

As divine clan elders, they knew the events of the Demon Clan’s past, with the divine clan even playing a leading role.

The younger divine clan members were confused; they hadn’t matured yet and didn’t know what had transpired.

“Do you really want to let this youth return to the Demon Clan?” The two Demon Clan elders barked, their voices laced with urgency.

“Kill!” The three divine clan elders’ faces shifted; if this Nan Gong Yuqing returned to the Demon Clan, it would harm their plans.

At the same time, the two Demon Clan elders wore cold expressions, moving through Luotian’s pressure toward the sky where Nan Gong Yuqing hovered.

“Return!” Two voices spoke simultaneously, and Luotian’s cold face appeared before the two Demon Clan elders. His spear, “Cracking Heaven,” glowed with radiant light, halting their steps.

On the other side, Sun Mengru’s face was icy as she scolded, her golden sword radiating ten thousand lights to block the three divine clan elders.

“Divine Princess!” The three divine clan elders frowned, gazing at Sun Mengru and asking: “Divine Princess, are you blocking us? If this youth doesn’t die, it will harm our divine clan!”

“Have you fallen for him? Are you taking his side?” One elder’s voice was sharp, questioning without the previous respect.

Though “Divine Princess” sounded good, these elders knew her fate. They had set aside Sun Mengru’s identity.

“Before they left, they did us a favor. Once we exit the ancient heavenly palace, you can deal with him as you wish. But in front of me, I will block it! I’ll bear the consequences myself!” Sun Mengru coldly spoke, scanning the three elders.

“Since when has our divine clan resorted to taking advantage of others’ misfortune!” Sun Mengru didn’t wait for their rebuttal, her voice resounding in the vast hall with unyielding pride.

“This…” The three elders were speechless, standing there without knowing what to say, their faces red as they gazed at Sun Mengru.

“I am the one who decides here! If you have any punishment, I’ll bear it alone!” Sun Mengru spoke again, her voice resolute and unyielding. Her body radiated divine light, resembling a celestial maiden, her pressure rising.

“Good! I hope the Divine Princess doesn’t regret it!” The three elders’ faces bore displeasure, returning to their divine clan’s ranks. Being rebuked by a junior stirred resentment in their hearts.

Chapter 980: The Demon’s Demise

In the third-level hall of the ancient heavenly palace, several figures stood tense, their gazes locking. The three divine clan elders deeply glanced at Sun Mengru, clearly dissatisfied with her actions.

A rift formed in Sun Mengru’s heart as she gazed at the divine clan elders. Raised within the divine clan, though they treated her differently since childhood, she still held deep affection for it.

Raised by Sun He Feng, she had never experienced much hardship. Yet Sun He Feng was like every divine clan parent, instilling in her that the divine clan was a race of divine blood, the most noble in the world. She should live proudly. But today’s three elders’ actions revealed another side of the divine clan.

The three divine clan elders also felt uneasy. Sun Mengru was stubborn, and they knew her pride differed from theirs.

Yet ultimately, Sun Mengru was the divine clan’s Divine Princess, and she held dominance in this ancient heavenly palace. The three elders reluctantly returned to their divine clan’s ranks.

The two Demon Clan elders’ faces darkened, gazing at the three divine clan elders before settling on Luotian and the arriving Lu Han Tian and Diao Dezhu. The three surrounded the two Demon Clan elders, blocking space to leave no escape.

“Seems your plan has failed,” Luotian said with amusement, gazing at the two Demon Clan elders. This phase allowed killing; Luotian knew Nan Gong Yuqing and them were mortal enemies but hadn’t acted. Everything awaited Nan Gong Yuqing’s decision.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound from the sky drew everyone’s attention back up. Nan Gong Yuqing and Nan Gong Feibai, like sworn enemies, finally decided their fate.

In sight, the black blade absorbed Nan Gong Feibai’s demonic figures, growing stronger before slicing into his body.

Nan Gong Yuqing’s sixth blade of the Seven Demon Blades was more skilled than Luotian’s. After absorbing Nan Gong Feibai’s techniques, its power increased again, enough to kill a Supreme Sage initial stage.

“Pf…” The black blade pierced Nan Gong Feibai’s body, tearing through space and splitting him in two. Blood mist scattered into the air.

“Dead… dead…” People’s faces showed horror, gazing at the blood mist with disbelief.

“The Demon Clan’s prince is dead! This is the first major faction’s prince to die since entering the ancient heavenly palace. Though the Eight Sacred Clans of the Beast Domain had young warriors fall, their status pales in comparison to Nan Gong Feibai’s!”

“Traitor! You killed my clan’s prince!” The two Demon Clan elders’ faces bore shock. They hadn’t expected Nan Gong Feibai to die so easily—after all, he was the Demon Clan’s prince.

“Killed him, what can you do? The prince position never belonged to him!” Nan Gong Feibai’s face was cold, his eyes scanning the two Supreme Sages elders.

“Hmph, this is finally interesting! A prodigy has fallen!” The previous sly old man appeared, his voice laced with excitement as he watched Nan Gong Feibai’s blood mist absorbed by the sky’s Bloodthirsty Demon Sword.

“Good, the demon sword is nearly complete!” The old man’s face showed satisfaction as he gazed at the Bloodthirsty Demon Sword, his eyes soft like watching offspring.

“Elder, where is your friend?” Luotian saw the old man and asked about Long Jie’s whereabouts.

“Don’t worry, he’s fine. He’s my old friend; I’m going to fetch the things he left here!” The old man spoke gently, then noticed so many people in the hall and furrowed his brows.

“Not enough! Leave twenty-five of you. The rest, decide among yourselves who stays and who leaves. You should understand my meaning!” The old man waved his hand, disappearing from sight again.

“By the way, only those with the most crimson auras can attempt to subdue my demon sword. Decide among yourselves!” The old man vanished, leaving a sharp laugh.

“Twenty-five!” Everyone’s gazes turned cautious as they looked at others, their auras slowly rising.

Nan Gong Yuqing stood like a demon lord before Luotian’s group, his eyes gradually regaining clarity. He panted heavily, gazing at the two Demon Clan elders: “This is just the beginning!”

The group totaled eight people. The divine clan had seven left, the Demon Clan only two, Star Domain four, and Beast Domain eight. The雷域 (Thunder Domain) had two left. Altogether thirty-one, far exceeding the old man’s set number.

Moreover, only five could have a chance to subdue the demon sword. Luotian’s brows furrowed slightly as he scanned around, observing everyone’s crimson auras.

“Now only six forces remain in this space—each one person. However, the numbers issue is somewhat problematic!” Luotian’s face was cold as he scanned around, like a hawk searching for prey.

The divine clan also constantly surveyed, their gazes lingering on Nan Gong Yuqing by Luotian’s side.

Meanwhile, the Thunder Domain and Demon Clan groups retreated a few steps, cautious as they watched the other four forces. Now, among these groups, they were the weakest.

“You come to me!” Feng Jiutian spoke, his voice high and divine-like, drawing the Demon Clan and Thunder Domain into his group.

“Let’s discuss eliminating those Four Sacred Star and Flame Domains!” Feng Jiutian, having drawn the Demon Clan and Thunder Domain into his group, now felt bolder. He addressed the divine clan and Star Domain groups:

“Hmph, Feng Jiutian, do you really think I wouldn’t kill you?” Luotian’s face was cold. Feng Jiutian’s repeated provocations had thoroughly angered him, and his killing intent凝聚ed. If Feng Jiutian spoke, Luotian would definitely make him regret it.

“Haha, a joke! If not for that bloodline-strong Dragon Clan youth, do you think you’d have lasted this long?” Feng Jiutian laughed loudly, gazing at Luotian. Without Long Jie, Feng Jiutian truly didn’t regard Luotian’s group as a threat.

Diao Dezhu stepped out from behind Luotian, smiling: “Feng Jiutian, do you really think you’ve got us cornered? Just because of those ragtag groups?”

“Diao Dezhu, you dare to help outsiders and provoke us. Are you even a Beast Domain person? If you come forward now, I might forgive you!” Feng Jiutian spoke solemnly, his gaze deep.

“Lu Xiong, do you need help?” Zhou Wei smiled and stepped in front of Luotian, with Star Domain’s group—clearly supporting Luotian.

Sun Mengru stood with her sword, slowly walking to Luotian’s side. The divine clan’s warriors behind her also wore smiles, following Sun Mengru.

“This…” Feng Jiutian gazed at Luotian’s group, stunned by their sudden strength.

“Divine clan, are you also helping Luotian’s group?” The two Demon Clan elders barked.

“Ridiculous! I don’t need your advice!” Sun Mengru coldly replied, her voice icy.

“Star Domain, since you entered the Beast Domain, we’ve treated you with courtesy. You also help them?” Feng Jiutian addressed Zhou Wei.

“You’re nothing! How dare you represent the Beast Domain? You only represent the Feng Clan. The Beast Domain doesn’t need your interference!” Diao Dezhu’s face bore disdain.

Luotian was also surprised by their support, puzzled by their actions.

“No choice but to find a big tree!” Zhou Wei chuckled lightly, not taking Feng Jiutian’s words seriously.

“Then there’s nothing to say—fight!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened, crushing a bone under his foot. He moved forward toward Luotian’s group.

“Fight!” Luotian roared, becoming a golden light and targeting the two Demon Clan elders. He fought them one-on-two, enclosing them in his battle circle.

Sun Mengru did the same, her golden sword radiating cold light, enclosing two Beast Domain Supreme Sages in her combat zone.

“Too fierce! Can we rest?” Xu Liyi lazily stood there, addressing Chen Zhanbiao and Xiu.

Luotian and Sun Mengru held off four Supreme Sages initial stage, while Feng Jiutian’s group had only one pale Thunder Domain Supreme Sage left. It was no challenge, a complete碾压 (overwhelming victory).

Lu Han Tian transformed into endless coldness and rushed toward Feng Jiutian, his icy palm striking him. Du Hong Tao directly targeted the Thunder Domain’s Supreme Sage.

The hall’s chaos resumed, with powerful fluctuations spreading again.

Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi stood still; Xu Liyi was too lazy to fight, needing no action. Diao Dezhu didn’t want to attack the Beast Domain’s people. They stood there, pointing and commenting, watching the twenty-plus people clash.

The three divine clan Supreme Sages didn’t fight; their eyes shifted, and their spiritual senses collided. No one knew what they were thinking.

Chapter 981: Stars Shine Over the Blue Sky

Within the third-level hall of the ancient heavenly palace, battle erupted again. Luotian moved like lightning, fighting two Demon Clan elders one-on-two.

“Arrogant!” The two Demon Clan elders gazed at Luotian, their eyes deep. They hadn’t expected him to be so bold as to fight two at once.

“Did you really think we were like those souls in the first level? To fight two at once, do you think you’re invincible?” One of them, his body radiating black energy, sneered and summoned his personal sacred weapon—a black sword. It resembled Luotian’s demon blade slightly.

The old man wore a black robe, his face square with white beard and long white hair—clearly someone who had seen much battle.

The other elder’s companion wore a cold expression, like an emperor of the night. His aged face was lined with wrinkles as he summoned a black demon cauldron.

“Two old wastes! You’re both Supreme Sages initial stage, and your ages are already long. I suppose you’ve reached the end of your days. Today, I’ll send both of you to your graves!” Luotian’s face bore contempt. Though his strength had declined, two Supreme Sages initial stage were still manageable for him.

“Little brat, you seek death!” Luotian’s words had clearly angered the two elders. They were old but their cultivation remained at Supreme Sages initial stage—otherwise, they wouldn’t have been sent to the ancient heavenly palace.

“Kill…” They transformed into two black dragons, rushing toward Luotian.

The spear hummed; Luotian’s face bore mockery as he calmly blocked the elders’ blades with his “Cracking Heaven” spear.

“Crack…” The black energy surged, clashing with Luotian’s spear. Black lightning sparked on his chest.

The square-faced elder retreated, his face filled with shock. Though he knew Luotian was strong, he hadn’t expected him to be this terrifying.

“Little brat, have you forgotten me?” The other Demon Clan elder’s face bore coldness. His black demon cauldron absorbed endless demonic energy, descending like a black mountain with thunderous might toward Luotian.

Luotian’s eyes flashed gold; his “Cracking Heaven” spear was planted in the void. His dantian roared with waves, and golden dragons howled from his dantian, wrapping around his arms.

Luotian’s entire body seemed forged in gold, like a supreme warrior standing proudly. His arm trembled, colliding with the black sacred weapon cauldron.

Thunder roared; terrifying fluctuations rose from their collision, spreading outward.

“Crack…” The black sacred weapon cauldron emitted cracking sounds, its cracks spreading as it flew back. It vanished from sight and collided with the hall’s ceiling, causing the third-level space to tremble.

“Unparalleled combat power!” Xu Liyi and Diao Dezhu gazed at Luotian, radiant like a deity, and sighed.

“Alas… the more powerful Luotian becomes, the more I fear the ‘sin’ character from the Heaven’s Will!” Xu Liyi sighed deeply, gazing at Luotian’s back.

“Yes, such an audacious person, if the Heaven’s Will suppresses him, how could he remain unscathed? Once we exit, I’ll have my grandfather check. Perhaps there’s still a way!” Diao Dezhu sighed, his black eyes showing concern.

The two elders’ faces bore shock; blood trickled from their mouths, stunned by Luotian’s strength.

“Terrifying! Such a person will surely become a domain master if he reaches the Supreme Sage peak!” The two elders exchanged thoughts, their voices trembling.

Since ancient times, domain masters were all undefeated in their eras—like Gu Tian Shi, the divine clan’s god-king, the Beast Domain’s Dragon Warlord, and the Demon Clan’s demon emperor. They overshadowed their contemporaries.

“Time to go. We’ll visit the Demon Clan soon!” Luotian’s face bore a cold smile as he took a step with his “Yanming Ghost Step,” crossing time’s river. Next moment, he appeared before the square-faced elder, his “Cracking Heaven” spear piercing into his body.

“Buddha’s Attack!” Luotian roared, increasing the tearing force within the elder’s body. Next moment, the square-faced elder was completely torn apart in his companion’s shocked gaze.

“Dead!” Luotian moved his hands, casting seals that bound the entire space and incinerated the elder’s flesh to prevent him from regenerating through blood.

“Die!” The other Demon Clan elder’s face turned pale; the sight of Luotian was terrifying, beyond his ability to handle. He and his companion were evenly matched, but Luotian had easily slain the square-faced elder. This one wouldn’t fare better.

“I’ve lived long enough; I’ll take you with me!” The elder’s face bore cruel intent, his body swelling as if preparing for self-destruction.

“No chance. The gap is too great!” Luotian’s eyes flashed, becoming a streak of light. His golden “Cracking Heaven” spear pierced the elder’s dantian.

The elder’s face changed; his entire body deflated like a burst balloon, following the square-faced elder’s fate.

Luotian remained calm as he descended from the sky, gazing around. His group held an absolute advantage. He then turned to Sun Mengru, smiling slightly.

In his view, Sun Mengru was like a celestial maiden from the moon, her long hair flowing. Her golden sacred weapon sword moved like a dragon through two Beast Domain Supreme Sages, her body transforming into a meteor. Her fist lightly struck, yet it instantly shattered one Beast Domain Supreme Sage.
