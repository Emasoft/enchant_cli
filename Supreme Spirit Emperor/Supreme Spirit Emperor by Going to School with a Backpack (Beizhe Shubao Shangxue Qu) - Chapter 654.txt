“Damn you!” Luo Tian’s feet tore free from the earth, his gaze locking onto the towering blue figure above.

“I’ve come to seek punishment! This fellow was definitely once a peak powerhouse!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly.

“Exactly, this is an ox. It once followed a top imperial sovereign and possesses immense strength!” Long Que sneered.

“Such a body—who could withstand it? Everyone here is变态! How the hell did I lose to an ox!” Luo Tian sighed bitterly, his eyes returning to the mighty figure descending from the heavens.

“Don’t worry—there are still chickens, ducks, and fish ahead. You’ll lose to them too!” Long Que’s words felt like a bucket of cold water, drenching Luo Tian.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian and Long Que exchanged words, the blue figure descended again. The azure axe cleaved through the heavens, its overwhelming aura slicing toward Luo Tian, causing his spirit to tremble.

“Things are looking risky. This kid’s luck is terrible—first the Human Emperor, then this ox!” One hundred and eight observers murmured in fascination at the scene above.

“I actually hope this kid succeeds. We have no backup candidates,” someone remarked, silencing the group.

“Indeed, if not for Tian’s intervention, we might have…” others sighed deeply, recalling the crisis years ago.

“Huh? This kid has some moves!” As people fell silent, the scene above shifted.

In the image, Luo Tian gripped his sword with both hands. Blood flowed from the white bones of his shoulders, his robes fluttering without wind, battered by waves of energy. His body radiated an earth-shaking aura.

“One Sword to Sever the Immortal!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened with ferocity. His sword, Long Yuan, began siphoning his cultivation.

“Hum…” The sword’s aura surged skyward. A black blade shot forth, radiating overwhelming power, slicing toward the descending blue figure.

“Brilliant kid!” The blue figure’s eyes narrowed at the earth-shaking blade, but he laughed aloud. His azure axe expanded further.

The thunderous clash echoed across the land. Luo Tian’s Long Yuan flew from his grasp, his body flying backward as blood spewed uncontrollably. The blue figure also retreated, its copper-like eyes wide with disbelief, gazing toward Luo Tian.

“He blocked it! And even repelled it!” One hundred and eight gasped, watching Luo Tian stand there, panting heavily, as if about to collapse. At this moment, Luo Tian was in a pitiful state—his body riddled with wounds, the most terrifying being a gash on his forehead that nearly split his skull.

“First time anyone has repelled the Blue Ox’s attack!” The crowd roared. They had all passed trials, some having faced the Blue Ox before. They knew its power was terrifying—no ordinary person could endure it. Yet Luo Tian had not only endured but repelled it, something they themselves hadn’t achieved.

“Again!” The Blue Ox seemed enraged by Luo Tian’s defiance. It panted heavily, winds swirling from its form as it soared into the air again, swinging its azure axe toward Luo Tian.

“One Sword to Sever the Immortal won’t even kill him!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, recalling Jiang Taibai’s words. The people in the Heavenly Palace weren’t humans—they were gods. This trial was so brutal; those who passed must be equally extraordinary.

A sense of crisis surged through Luo Tian’s spirit. The Blue Ox lacked the Human Emperor Fu Xi’s mercy; if this strike landed, Luo Tian would be split in two.

“Demon Cloud Wings!”

“One Sword to Sever the Immortal!” In life-or-death desperation, Luo Tian roared again. Black and white wings erupted from his back, flapping rapidly. Long Yuan returned to his grasp, siphoning the last of his cultivation.

“Hum…” The long sword hummed. Wind and thunder erupted from Luo Tian’s Demon Cloud Wings, forming a storm that swept toward the Blue Ox.

This was Luo Tian’s first full deployment of Demon Cloud Wings. He had no choice—previous One Sword to Sever the Immortal had drained six-tenths of his cultivation. A second use wouldn’t hold the same power.

Boom…

The storm swept, the heavens trembled. Thunder clashed within the gales, a violent aura making Luo Tian jump in surprise.

“Hum…” As the humming sound echoed, all of Luo Tian’s cultivation was siphoned by Long Yuan. The black blade surged forward, striking the Blue Ox.

The axe clashed. Luo Tian even experienced an illusion—seeing a sage劈山河 with one strike, his aura overwhelming.

Boom… Two resounding crashes shattered the heavens, a cataclysmic wave spreading outward. The onlookers gaped in astonishment.

“Is this kid at the initial stage of Immortal King?” An old man spoke, drawing agreement. Everyone harbored this suspicion—Luo Tian wasn’t merely at the initial stage of Immortal King.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s body fell to the ground, blood gushing from his wounds, soaking the earth.

“Is he dead?” Those watching Luo Tian wondered. The Blue Ox stood nearby, its eyes filled with admiration.

…Dong… Dong…

Luo Tian lay there, his eyes closed. Yet he felt himself enter another state—only his heartbeat echoed in his ears, as if his soul had left his body.

He remained immersed in the battle’s memory, replaying the Blue Ox’s awe-inspiring axe strike. One strike had shattered his storm of Demon Cloud Wings and the siphoning One Sword to Sever the Immortal. This would have been unthinkable in the previous celestial realm, even for peers.

“Power!”

“I thought Wild Wind was the pinnacle of power. But someone’s strength surpasses it!” Luo Tian muttered, listening to his heartbeat.

Defeat surged within him. Though he’d faced failure before since leaving the Tianyuan Continent, none had felt as intense as this trial. First, the Human Emperor’s single strike shattered his seventh step of Man Qi. Then the Blue Ox’s three strikes nearly split him in two. Yet he was also awestruck—ancient era masters’ power truly transcended human limits.

“Passed!” The Blue Ox observed Luo Tian lying there, speaking solemnly. His voice carried admiration before he sat upon the mountain peak like a mountain itself.

“How did he do it? His body reached its limit?” Luo Tian, however, seemed not to hear the Blue Ox’s words. He pondered deeply.

“Tianmo Body Shattering allowed me to master my body thoroughly. Wild Wind granted sevenfold physical strength, but only for fists and Man Qi!” Luo Tian gradually understood.

“If I could evolve Wild Wind into a grand technique, every attack would possess sevenfold physical strength. How terrifying!”

“One strike overcomes all methods. Fan Tian Attack!” Luo Tian suddenly recalled a long-forgotten technique. These two techniques, once forbidden in the celestial realm due to rule changes, had been unparalleled in the Nine Domains.

“First, recover my injuries!” Luo Tian muttered, regaining some sensation. He felt his wounds, shuddering.

“Three mortal injuries… countless minor wounds…” Luo Tian instantly sensed the severity of his injuries, laughing bitterly.

“Can’t move…” Soon he realized how dire his condition was. He could only lie there, waiting for his powerful body to heal itself.

“Approximately seven days before I can move again. Consume pills to recover!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, grateful for his luck. Three mortal wounds—had they been deeper, he would have died. Now every part of his body ached.

“Luck—pure luck. Next time, I must rely on strength!” Luo Tian resolved inwardly.

“Forecast—my goal is to evolve a grand technique suitable for the celestial realm, boosting my strength significantly!” Luo Tian resolved, already forming a rough plan. He endured the pain, pondering suitable grand techniques.

Time passed slowly. Seven days vanished in an instant. Luo Tian’s wounds, thanks to his powerful body, had healed. Externally, no injuries were visible.

Luo Tian moved his fingers. The pain lessened. He took a pill, sat cross-legged on the ground, and accelerated his recovery.

Luo Tian’s injuries were external, not affecting his core. With the pills, he recovered quickly—only three days passed before he was fully healed.

“Kid, power isn’t just about the body!” The Blue Ox saw Luo Tian rise and spoke, causing Luo Tian’s body to tremble slightly.

“Not just the body?” Luo Tian had spent seven days in contemplation without success, but he felt a vague sense.

“External forces are also power. The power of heaven and earth is power. The power of true immortals is power! All things in the world exist within power!” Luo Tian muttered, observing his palm. He clenched his fist, frowning.

“Harness all power into my attacks—this is the ultimate strength!”

“How can I make all power, even the enemy’s, serve me? That’s the hardest part!” Luo Tian muttered softly, waves emanating from his hands.

Luo Tian walked while contemplating. His pace was slow but he soon passed the Blue Ox’s mountain.

“This kid’s body is truly remarkable. I hope it clicks with him. He seems to have awakened, but my Bull’s Strength isn’t suitable for him. After all, he’s human!” The Blue Ox muttered quietly, watching Luo Tian leave.

Chapter 2454: Li Dao()

“How can I gather all power into my attack?” Luo Tian walked, pondering this question. Unconsciously, he reached the third mountain.

On the third peak sat an old man. Though aged, his posture was straight. His eyes held a smile as he watched Luo Tian ascend the mountain.

“Withstand my three strikes, and you pass!” The old man spoke, gazing at Luo Tian. Yet Luo Tian seemed lost in thought, ignoring him.

“Are you listening to me?” The old man’s brow furrowed slightly. His eyes showed displeasure, but Luo Tian still ignored him, his hands constantly evolving, waves emanating from them.

“Something’s off… too far off!” Luo Tian muttered softly. His feet moved unconsciously forward, soon reaching the old man’s presence.

“Dare you mock me!” The old man’s face darkened. Luo Tian’s demeanor clearly showed he didn’t regard him.

The old man, though once a great sage, wasn’t someone Luo Tian could insult. Even if he was just a fragment of will, the dignity of a sage couldn’t be mocked.

As he spoke, Luo Tian had already passed the old man, walking down the mountain.

“Damn kid!” The old man’s face darkened. He took a step forward, chasing Luo Tian, and struck him with a palm aimed at his skull. If it landed, Luo Tian would be crushed without defense.

They weren’t far apart. In an instant, the old man’s earth-shaking palm reached Luo Tian’s head.

“Hm?” In an instant, Luo Tian sensed danger. His body turned sharply and struck back.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed. Luo Tian kept retreating, blood spilling from his mouth. His eyes regained clarity as he gazed at the old man.

“What’s going on!” The old man’s eyes widened. His body kept retreating, his expression filled with disbelief.

His previous strike could have killed Luo Tian. Yet Luo Tian’s palm had immense power, even repelling him.

“What’s going on?” The one hundred and eight observers gaped, watching Luo Tian standing there with a thoughtful expression.

“Again!” This time, Luo Tian actively attacked the old man. His palm still bore flowing divine patterns, radiating overwhelming power.

“Boom…” Both men retreated simultaneously. Luo Tian’s body flew backward, his palm riddled with cracks. He gazed at the old man who had only retreated a few steps.

“This…” Luo Tian finally realized he was in the trial. A cold sweat formed on his forehead.

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian quickly bowed, sincerely thanking the old man. He had finally made progress in his grand technique research but hadn’t fully mastered it until the old man’s strike gave him an epiphany.

“All power is usable. Any force, I can control!” Luo Tian’s heart rejoiced. Though his technique wasn’t complete yet, its power was undeniably formidable.

“You’re insulting me. I’m dying!” The old man was infuriated by Luo Tian’s thanks, gritting his teeth and shouting. He rushed toward Luo Tian again.

The heavens trembled as a golden hand凝聚, radiating immense pressure. It crushed toward Luo Tian.

“Master!” Luo Tian gazed at the earth-shaking palm, his face slightly changed. His palm’s divine patterns flowed again, striking back.

The earth shook. Luo Tian’s body flew backward, blood spewing from his mouth. Yet his eyes held excitement.

“What’s going on?” The old man, retreating a few steps, gazed at the flying Luo Tian.

“What’s this? He was strengthened by the Human Emperor and Blue Ox?” The one hundred and eight observers gaped, watching Luo Tian stand up.

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian’s gaze met the old man. That strike was incredibly powerful, but he had withstood it thanks to his evolved technique.

“This isn’t complete yet. If I finish it, my attack power would at least triple! Combined with Man Qi, it would reach a terrifying level!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with anticipation. He looked at the old man, grateful. Without that sudden strike, he wouldn’t have figured it out so quickly.

“Provocation—blatant provocation!” But Luo Tian’s smile infuriated the old man.

“Master, I’ll be going now!” Luo Tian smiled, bowing to the old man. Under the old man’s furious gaze, he descended the mountain.

“Drive me mad! Drive me mad!” Watching Luo Tian leave, the old man raged but could only watch him go.

“Withstand my five strikes… withstand my three…”

The rest of the journey was relatively smooth. Luo Tian encountered various masters, though none matched the Human Emperor or Blue Ox. Yet in their prime, they were all great sages.

Luo Tian kept getting beaten, each strike deepening his understanding of his evolved technique. The essence was simple—borrowing power, using all possible forces in his attacks.

Luo Tian passed mountain after mountain, encountering thirty-five ancient sages.

“Glory! So powerful. Over thirty, each would command a celestial mountain now. What happened in the ancient times to make so many sages vanish?”

“Where is Master Guiguzi?” Luo Tian muttered, stepping onto the thirty-sixth mountain.

This month had brought immense gains for Luo Tian. He’d nearly died several times but endured. His evolved technique was gradually maturing—when unleashed, it could boost his attack power by about double.

“I haven’t thought of a good name yet,” Luo Tian muttered. He was confident this technique was unique, like Taihao Fuxi’s and Bull’s Strength—heritage techniques passed to his bloodline.

“The last one. If you pass, you’ll reach us!” The one hundred and eight observers gazed with anticipation. They knew Luo Tian’s progress over the past month.

“This kid’s technique still isn’t complete, but it’s already very good!” An old man spoke.

“Indeed. He finally has his own technique!” Gu Tianxiu’s eyes held a smile.

Gu Tianxiu had once wondered if giving Luo Tian Fan Tian Attack and Fa Xiang Tian Di was correct. In the celestial realm, he realized his mistake. After arriving in the celestial realm, Gu Tianxiu knew everyone must walk their own path. Luo Tian had done well, even becoming the Epoch Lord, a level no one in the Nine Domains reached.

Yet he lacked something—creating his own suitable techniques. All martial arts and skills were inherited. In the Nine Domains, it was fine, but in the celestial realm, these mixed elements were obstacles. Though not used, they couldn’t be forgotten.

As people murmured, Luo Tian reached the peak of the thirty-sixth mountain.

A old man sat cross-legged, then stood slowly. His white beard and hair, his immortal aura, wearing gray Daoist robes, holding a whisk, gazed at Luo Tian.

“Another master…” Luo Tian’s eyes immediately hardened. He locked gazes with the old man.

“Three strikes—pass!” The old man smiled, giving a warm feeling. No one felt hatred.

“This kid’s luck… no one has it!”

“Two of the Three Ancient Emperors!” Seeing Luo Tian face this old man, the one hundred and eight observers roared.

“Kid, this old man’s name is Li Dao. Be careful. Don’t let his amiable appearance fool you—he’s ruthless. He was one of the Three Celestial Emperors in ancient times!” Long Que’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“The Three Celestial Emperors!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched. This old man seemed stronger than Human Emperor Fu Xi.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian was awestruck, the old man lightly flicked his whisk. A breeze emerged from before him, then rapidly expanded.

Whoosh…

A storm swept, an invisible wave spreading toward Luo Tian. His eyes narrowed slightly.

“Wind power is also power!” Luo Tian roared. Demon Cloud Wings erupted from his back, divine patterns flowing across them. His wings flapped rapidly, sending a storm toward the old man.

The heavens shifted. Two massive whirlwinds formed—two storms colliding instantly.

Crash…

The heavens thundered, as if entering the end times. The two whirlwinds clashed, but Luo Tian’s storm was crushed within moments, becoming sharp blades that swept in all directions.

“This won’t work?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened. He watched the storm, which had barely been blocked, still unrelenting.

In an instant, the storm struck Luo Tian. A suffocating feeling invaded him, and he felt as if cut by knives.

“Can’t withstand it!” Luo Tian’s heart cried. His body was lifted by the storm, spinning endlessly.

It lasted a quarter of an hour before the storm gradually calmed. The scene returned to calmness.

“Did that kid turn to dust?” Those watching Luo Tian gaped at the scene above.

Chapter 2455: Darkness Divine Lord()

The heavens gradually healed, chaos filling the world. Li Dao smiled calmly, gazing at the healing heavens.

“Dead or not?”

“This kid is too unlucky. He entered with insufficient strength, but mastered that grand technique. His strength is nearly enough to pass. Unfortunately, he met two of the Three Celestial Emperors!”

People murmured, believing Luo Tian had little chance. That storm would only be withstood by an Immortal King in the middle stage.

“No!” But as people murmured, they saw a black dot falling from the heavens.

The dot fell rapidly, crashing onto a mountain with a dull sound.

“Second strike!” The old man smiled, watching the battered figure on the ground. He waved his whisk again, divine laws flowing. His white whisk transformed into a white waterfall, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“No time to catch his breath!” People gasped. Though they couldn’t hear the trial’s sounds, they could see Li Dao’s gestures.

“No way he can survive! Look at his half-dead state—how could he withstand it? He hasn’t even stood up yet!” People gasped, watching the fallen Luo Tian with closed eyes—whether alive or dead.

“Impossible!” Gu Tianxiu sat on the mountain peak, his eyes flashing with light. He muttered but clenched his fists.

Gu Tianxiu rarely felt tension. Luo Tian was his most favored disciple. Now facing life or death, Gu Tianxiu felt tension.

“Li Dao, you’ve gone too far!” As the white waterfall swept toward Luo Tian, a cold voice echoed through the heavens. A radiant red lotus erupted from Luo Tian’s forehead, flying toward the white waterfall.

The lotus was only palm-sized but contained world-destroying power. Even Gu Tianxiu and others outside the trial could sense its terror.

Boom…

In an instant, the crimson lotus exploded. It turned into a sea of red flames, engulfing the entire world. The mountain peak became crimson. The one hundred and eight observers saw only an endless red ocean, as if burning through the heavens toward them. Some instinctively defended themselves.

The white waterfall was instantly consumed by red flames. No one knew what happened in the trial. The fire lasted a quarter of an hour before gradually fading. The one hundred and eight observers inhaled sharply, gazing at the scene above.

Nothingness—entire world void. A single figure hovered there: Luo Tian, just recovered, looking bewildered.

Nearby, Li Dao stood. His aura gradually rose. His whisk had been burned to a stub, held in his hand.

“Old friend, come out!” Li Dao’s aura changed. His eyes deepened, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was still bewildered but soon felt an irresistible aura enveloping him. His nine-colored flame mark on the neck vanished, becoming a black demon flame. His consciousness gradually faded.

Luo Tian’s neck mark began to wander, merging into his body. This mark was the figure that had followed Luo Tian since he first entered Mount Wulao, eventually becoming a mark on his neck.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes again. His gaze held a black glint. He stood up, his body now bearing an aura of沧桑, matching Li Dao’s.

“Who are you?” A voice exclaimed. A gray sparrow flew from Luo Tian, instantly expanding into a phoenix with an dragon’s body. Its crimson eyes stared at Luo Tian.

“Who are you? Long Que, I didn’t think you were still alive!” A solemn voice echoed from Luo Tian’s mouth—not his own.

“Who are you? You’re the Divine Lord! How did you end up in this kid’s body? I didn’t notice!” Long Que’s voice held shock, gazing at the Luo Tian shrouded in black mist.

“Back then, what happened? How did you all perish? Are you still alive?” Long Que asked, voice heavy.

“I am the Divine Lord. You’ve escaped once before, but this time, you can’t!” The entity possessing Luo Tian’s body spoke. Its voice alone gave a cold feeling.

“Did you all die? I only care about this question. And you—will you come out yourself, or do I have to ask?” Long Que shouted, his red flames rising. He stared at Luo Tian.

“Everything has changed. This time, no one can escape!” Li Dao’s aura also shifted, gazing at the changed Luo Tian.

“Dead or not—doesn’t matter. My current state is just a fragment of soul, similar to Li Dao’s!”

“I want to tell you, Long Que. Even as a world beast, you can’t escape. So try to recover. This kid might be a variable!” The Divine Lord spoke, gazing at Long Que.

“What happened?” Long Que was confused by their words. He had lost that memory.

“Enough. I should go now. You’ll understand when the time comes!” A black mist flew from Luo Tian, and the black demon flame mark vanished. A veil of black fog drifted away.

“Explain before you go!” Long Que shouted, furious. This guy was irresponsible, leaving him confused.

“Right now, you can’t withstand me. Though I’m just a fragment of soul!” The Divine Lord laughed coldly, raising his hand. The heavens split. He struck with a black hand, colliding with Long Que’s fire mark.

Boom…

The heavens trembled. The entire trial ground shook. Black mist vanished, disappearing into the torn heavens.

“Damn it…” Long Que cursed, gazing at Li Dao. “Tell me what happened back then!”

“I don’t know. I’m not even a fragment of soul—just a will. The main body must have foreseen the Divine Lord’s arrival, ordering me to attack this kid!” Li Dao smiled, unbothered by Long Que’s threat.

“Damn fool!” Long Que muttered, more puzzled than ever.

“Luck—this Divine Lord revived due to this kid’s luck. But when? Before I met him?” Long Que muttered, no longer thinking. He felt he had survived but lost much.

“Who are they? That phoenix with a dragon’s tail—what is he? And that figure shrouded in black mist?” The one hundred and eight observers gazed at the scene, shocked.

“They’re all great sages. Those two figures seem to have emerged from this kid!” People murmured, sensing Luo Tian’s complexity.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. He saw Long Que flying toward him, his gaze bewildered. Then he widened his eyes.

“What happened? How did I recover?” Luo Tian’s gaze held shock. He had completely lost consciousness, even lacking control over his body. His memory stopped at Li Dao’s second attack.

“Nothing. Some things you don’t need to know yet!” Long Que transformed into a gray sparrow, perching on Luo Tian’s shoulder. He gazed at Li Dao standing nearby.

“Third strike!” Li Dao smiled, returning to his immortal aura. His whisk swept toward Luo Tian again.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian suddenly awoke, not asking Long Que his questions. Instinctively, he unleashed his incomplete attack. Black patterns flowed across his palm, clashing with the white whisk.

Boom…

The next moment, a shocking scene unfolded. Luo Tian’s black hand, radiating overwhelming power, collided with the whisk.

The thunderous clash echoed across the land. The heavens shattered again. Luo Tian’s body flew backward, blood spilling from his mouth. His eyes held disbelief at his palm.

“Divine Lord’s power!” Long Que furrowed his brows, releasing a strong spiritual sense to examine Luo Tian.

“Residual?” Long Que wondered. He had to be cautious. The Divine Lord had a terrible reputation in the ancient times, being an enemy of the Three Celestial Emperors. His methods were unparalleled.

Luo Tian was bewildered, feeling he had missed many things during his confusion.

“Passed!” Li Dao smiled lightly. He didn’t continue attacking but sat on the mountain peak.

“Did I pass?” Luo Tian gazed at Li Dao. He had only withstood one strike; he didn’t know about the remaining two.

“Go. The exit is ahead!” Li Dao pointed toward the distance.

Luo Tian didn’t ask further. Though he had many questions, he knew these sages were eccentric. If they didn’t tell him, they wouldn’t. He couldn’t threaten them.

“I’ll come back here when I’m stronger and beat all of you!” Luo Tian muttered, his joy overriding the annoyance. He stepped down the mountain.

Chapter 2456: Ascending the Ruins

Dizziness overwhelmed Luo Tian. Yet his eyes held excitement, waiting for the transport to complete.

Before he steadied himself, a white-cloaked figure stood before him. His eyes held a smile, admiration in his gaze.

“Congratulations on passing the Heavenly Palace’s trial!” A calm voice echoed. Luo Tian’s heart trembled, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Grand Ancestor!” Luo Tian bowed deeply, excitedly speaking.

“Rise,” Grand Ancestor Gu Tianxiu said with satisfaction. He helped Luo Tian up.

“Kid, you passed two of the Three Emperors. You’re quite good!” As Luo Tian was helped up, he heard voices around him—each filled with admiration.

“This…” Observing carefully, Luo Tian gazed at the surroundings, his eyes filled with shock.

One hundred and eight peaks. Each carried a decaying aura, dilapidated buildings connected one after another. Yet the structures still held laws, preventing collapse.

“This is the Heavenly Palace—once an infinite glory!” Gu Tianxiu spoke softly, walking with Luo Tian through the buildings.

“Grand Ancestor, have you reached Immortal King’s middle stage?” Luo Tian sensed Gu Tianxiu’s cultivation, surprised.

He also felt the powerful auras on each of the one hundred and eight peaks. The weakest was Immortal King’s middle stage, while the strongest—those innermost peaks—were unclear due to distance or cultivation gaps. Yet Luo Tian was certain: these people were all strong, each giving him a profound sense of danger.

“Do you know me?” A woman stood on the peak, her beauty unparalleled. Her face held a gentle smile as she gazed at Luo Tian.

“You…” Luo Tian’s eyes widened. He stared at the woman standing there.

“Master Miaoyin!” Luo Tian exclaimed, speechless. His mind recalled the image of a woman who had slain a蛮族 powerhouse on the Broken Mountain God Cliff. Master Miaoyin of the Four Sacred Domains, whose husband Zhongli Tian was also a reincarnation body like Luo Tian.

“I’ve met you before. Good!” Master Miaoyin smiled, greeting Luo Tian.

“I… I…” Luo Tian had no words. He hadn’t expected to meet Master Miaoyin here, the former Epoch Lord of the Four Sacred Domains.

“Look carefully. Are there others you recognize?” Gu Tianxiu smiled, speaking to Luo Tian. Not only was Luo Tian stunned upon arrival, but so had he.

“Haha, kid, do you know me?” A big man laughed loudly, standing on the peak and shouting at Luo Tian.

“Don’t know…” Luo Tian shook his head. He truly didn’t recognize this man.

“He’s human, of course you don’t know. But I heard Tianxiu said this kid leveled the Nine Domains, making the royal clan and humans coexist!” An old man spoke, drawing Luo Tian’s gaze to him.

“My heavens!” Seeing the old man, Luo Tian’s breath paused slightly. Though now an Immortal King, he almost knelt.

“Jie Tian’s Lord!” Luo Tian exclaimed, gazing at the old man and bowing deeply. The second Epoch Lord of the human race, who had swept through ancient royal clans alone, securing humanity’s stability—Jie Tian’s Lord, Jun Wulei!
