Though it was merely a corner of the great formation, it still compelled Wan Lingkong to take it seriously. None but himself could unravel this formation in the present age.

As he spoke, Wan Lingkong led Luo Tian and his companions through relentless combat, seemingly charging headlong into a sea of human-shaped lightning. Yet, had someone observed from above, they would have seen that the path Wan Lingkong and Luo Tian took traced intricate array patterns.

"One hour... two hours..." Time passed slowly as Wan Lingkong moved, his eyes alight with calculation. Even he, the prodigy, bore a pallid complexion.

"Found it!" After three hours of relentless traversal, Wan Lingkong suddenly roared, rekindling the fading resolve in Luo Tian and his companions' eyes.

"Open!" Wan Lingkong's eyes burned with excitement as a golden banner shot from his hand, soaring like a meteor through the thunderstorm before plunging into the void.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The next moment, a deafening explosion echoed through the heavens. Upon the banner's entry into the void, all human-shaped lightning shattered violently, merging into terrifying thunderclaps that surged back into the Thunder Sea. Luo Tian's group exhaled deeply in relief.

"Let us see who controls this array's core!" Wan Lingkong waved his hands, and a vast expanse of thunder vanished from Luo Tian's sight.

"Rumble..." A figure materialized amidst Luo Tian's group, unlike the previous lightning forms. This entity was a tangible human, yet its form remained obscured by surrounding thunderclaps, rendering its features indistinct.

"Who is this!" Luo Tian activated his formidable spiritual awareness, plunging into the lightning's embrace. His eyes widened in disbelief.

"Ren Hongzhe!" Diao Dezu whispered, his spiritual senses piercing the thunder-wrapped figure. His gaze reflected astonishment.

Luo Tian could not fathom encountering Ren Hongzhe, the third of the Star River Four Thieves.

"Roar..." A crimson glow pierced through the azure thunder, as Ren Hongzhe lunged at Luo Tian with feral intensity. His aura was formidable, and serpentine thunderbolts erupted from his form, surging toward Luo Tian's group.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's companions grimaced, recalling the notorious "Big Mouth" Ren Hongzhe. Now transformed into this monstrous state.

"Subdue him first!" Luo Tian's voice was cold as he rushed forward, extending his hand to seize Ren Hongzhe.

"Crash..." Ren Hongzhe transformed into a streak of azure lightning, vanishing from Luo Tian's grasp. In an instant, he reappeared behind Wan Lingkong, launching a punch toward his back.

Azure thunder enveloped Ren Hongzhe's fist, its power immense as it struck Wan Lingkong's heart.

"Epoch Prime! How has he grown so strong? What transpired in this Thunder Sea Marsh that left him in such a state?" Wan Lingkong's face darkened as he countered with a punch, repelling Ren Hongzhe while his mind trembled.

"Suppress!" Luo Tian unleashed the Divine King's Nine Heavens Diagram, his expression grave as it descended upon Ren Hongzhe.

Compared to the others, Luo Tian pondered more. Earlier, Li Tian had led the remaining members of the Thunder Domain into this marsh. Clearly, their experiences here hadn't been favorable.

What had become of Gu Qianxue and the others? Had they already passed through this marsh?

"Forgive me!" Luo Tian sighed softly as Ren Hongzhe, now frenzied and attacking relentlessly, approached. He activated the Dao of Sealing Demons, striking toward Ren Hongzhe.

"Crack..." The collision sent waves of thunder surging between them. Ren Hongzhe's face contorted in pain, yet he darted forward again.

"Brave and fearless... has he been controlled?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly. An invisible wave radiated from his form, penetrating Ren Hongzhe's body. Within it, he discerned countless inscriptions adorning Ren Hongzhe's soul, glowing with azure light. The soul appeared like a ghostly apparition.

"Seal the Soul!" Luo Tian murmured, his invisible wave transforming into a blade-like force that cleaved Ren Hongzhe's soul.

"Boom..." The azure inscriptions shattered under Luo Tian's strike, and Ren Hongzhe's soul gradually stabilized.

"Ren Hongzhe! Wake up!" Luo Tian roared, his thunderclap shattering the void. His voice carried supreme authority, a spiritual storm surging into Ren Hongzhe's body. The inscriptions on his soul rapidly disintegrated.

As the inscriptions faded, Ren Hongzhe's crimson eyes dimmed. His thunderclaps gradually dissipated, his movements slowing until Diao Dezu and the others subdued him, his body trembling.

After a quarter-hour, all inscriptions vanished from Ren Hongzhe's soul. His thunderclaps disappeared entirely, his hazy eyes clearing as he gazed at Luo Tian's group.

"Luotian!" Ren Hongzhe gasped, his eyes filled with surprise.

"Why are you here?" Ren Hongzhe asked directly, as if forgetting all prior events.

"What happened? Why did you lose your mind? What transpired?" Luo Tian didn't answer but questioned Ren Hongzhe urgently, desperate to learn what had transpired in the Thunder Sea Marsh.

"What happened?" Ren Hongzhe's eyes reflected recollection. Then, as if recalling something, his face paled, and he bore a look of anguish. A stream of blood erupted from his mouth.

"Everyone is dead... everyone is dead!" Ren Hongzhe howled, his eyes filled with unbearable sorrow. His entire body trembled as he pounded his chest repeatedly.

"Everyone is dead... the brothers of the Star River Four Thieves are all gone! Even the fourth brother is dead!" Ren Hongzhe's voice trembled with profound grief, his body shaking uncontrollably.

"What!" Luo Tian and his companions were stunned, their bodies jolting in disbelief.

"How is that possible!" Luo Tian gasped, his heart filled with sorrow. His gaze locked onto Ren Hongzhe, awaiting further explanation.

"Who is it!" Luo Tian seized Ren Hongzhe's trembling body, demanding answers.

The Star River Four Thieves instantly reminded Luo Tian of those iron-willed men—true warriors. He remembered their respect for him, the iron-willed comrades he had known. He refused to believe they had perished so.

"Everyone is dead... everyone is dead! My brothers are all gone. What's the point of me living?" Ren Hongzhe's face was pale, his eyes lifeless. He whispered softly, no longer the lively Ren Hongzhe Luo Tian had known.

Chapter 1415: Revenge and Retribution

"Ren Hongzhe!" Luo Tian called out, his voice like a thunderous incantation. It rekindled some light in Ren Hongzhe's lifeless eyes.

"Luotian... revenge. We must avenge our brothers!" Ren Hongzhe, seeing Luo Tian, clutched him desperately, his eyes filled with entreaty.

"Rest assured. I will avenge our brothers. First, tell me what happened!" Luo Tian consoled Ren Hongzhe, his eyes cold as he gazed into the depths of the Thunder Sea.

"After we retreated into the Thunder Sea Marsh, we had barely taken a step when we were surrounded by human-shaped lightning. No matter how hard we fought, we could not exterminate them!"

"Later, for unknown reasons, those human-shaped lightning vanished. We thought we were saved, but something far worse happened. A force beyond our control entered our bodies, and we lost all self-control, turning on each other!"

"Those were my brothers! After losing our minds, we turned against one another. I could clearly feel I had killed my own comrades—my brothers!" Ren Hongzhe howled, his voice filled with anguish. The iron-willed man now wept.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth, understanding Ren Hongzhe's pain. If it were him, he would have gone mad.

"Whoever you are, even if you are the son of an Epoch Prime, I will destroy you. You'll regret ever setting foot in this world!" Luo Tian roared into the thunder, charging toward its depths.

"Don't blame yourself," Luo Tian gently patted Ren Hongzhe's back, his voice laced with helplessness.

Luo Tian knew this incident would become a lifelong nightmare for Ren Hongzhe, surely affecting his later years.

"I want to know how many of you are still alive," Luo Tian's gaze locked onto Ren Hongzhe, though he hated dredging up painful memories.

"I don't know. I only know that the second brother is still alive. It seems only I and the second brother remain," Ren Hongzhe gazed at his hands, his eyes bloodshot.

"Boom... boom..." His arms exploded violently, blood splattering onto his body. Ren Hongzhe's eyes brimmed with deep sorrow.

"Don't blame yourself. They won't hold it against you," Luo Tian didn't know how to console Ren Hongzhe. His heart was filled with hatred, which he forced down as he comforted the volatile Ren Hongzhe.

"Don't worry. I won't lose my mind. I need to avenge them! If I don't even know what the enemy looks like, they'll be angry with me!" Ren Hongzhe's eyes held self-mockery.

"Alas..." Diao Dezu and the others also bore expressions of anger. Naturally, Diao Dezu and Wan Lingkong knew the Star River Four Thieves well; their hearts were filled with hatred.

"Let's go! I want to see who it is!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly as he strode toward the depths of the Thunder Sea Marsh.

With Ren Hongzhe's addition, Luo Tian's group didn't slow down but became more cautious.

The thunder grew denser, pressing upon them with immense pressure. It caused their bodies to emit wisps of white smoke.

"Hard to withstand!" Luo Tian's group felt the thunder contained a trace of heavenly Dao power. Their faces finally changed.

"Buzz..." Sun Kemin raised his hand, and a Yang Fish appeared above their heads. A radiant light enveloped them, repelling the terrifying thunder.

As they walked, more thunder surged from all sides, forming a powerful cage that surrounded Luo Tian's group. Their expressions turned grave again.

"Welcome to my world!" A mocking voice echoed in their minds, causing them to jolt.

"It's him! That was the same voice!" Ren Hongzhe's eyes instantly turned blood-red as he gazed into the distance, his expression frenzied.

"Who are you? Dare to show yourself!" Ren Hongzhe roared, his voice thick with hatred.

"Ah, I didn't expect a trash like you to have ascended to Epoch Prime. How amusing!" The voice carried mockery, echoing through the thunderous sound in their minds.

"Dare to show yourself!" Luo Tian's eyes deepened. His formidable spiritual senses surged outward, seeking the voice's source.

Yet he soon felt disappointment. No figures were visible within his spiritual senses' reach.

"Show yourself, and you must prove your worth! It's been a while since I've met such entertaining company. I'll play with you!" The mocking voice echoed in their minds.

"Roar..." A roar erupted in their minds. A massive figure appeared before Luo Tian's group.

"This was my pet back then. If you can defeat it, you'll have a chance to meet me. I await you in the depths. Don't disappoint me!" The voice faded, causing Luo Tian's group to frown.

"Who is he?" Diao Dezu asked softly, his voice laced with confusion. His expression darkened.

"He seems to be the true master of this Thunder Sea," Wan Lingkong spoke softly, causing them all to fall silent.

"Roar..." Before they could think further, a massive thunder beast charged toward Luo Tian's group. Its immense body brought overwhelming pressure.

"Epoch Prime! A pet at Epoch Prime level? Is he an Epoch Prime?" Luo Tian's group grew more solemn.

"Never mind. Let's deal with this beast first!" Luo Tian sighed, both to find clues about Gu Qianxue and Li Tian. They continued moving forward.

"Roar..." The beast's massive foot stomped down, sending waves of thunder surging upward.

"Everyone back! I'll handle it!" Luo Tian took the lead, fearing injury to his companions. Though this thunder beast was weaker than an Epoch Prime's formation, it was made of lightning. If careless, it could severely injure them.

Luo Tian's figure surged skyward as he unleashed the Dao of Sealing Demons, two great arts combined. He struck with a fist, colliding with the thunder beast's massive foot.

"Boom... boom..." The deafening sound echoed. The Thunder Sea surged, and even the thunder beast was no match for Luo Tian in close combat.

The massive body collapsed violently, roaring skyward. Waves of thunder continuously erupted from the beast's form.

"Merely a mindless beast!" Diao Dezu sneered, rushing toward the thunder beast to test its strength.

"Let me take on an Epoch Prime with my Epoch Midway!" Diao Dezu sneered, appearing before the beast's head. A surge of purple energy flowed into his fist as he struck toward its head.

But the next moment, the beast's eyes turned cold. It opened its mouth and spat out a torrent of thunder, forming a thousand-zhang-long lightning dragon that descended upon Diao Dezu's body.

"Zhi..." Wisps of white smoke rose from Diao Dezu's body. He trembled, standing there before falling to the ground in a charred state.

"Damn it! You're still showing off!" Luo Tian cursed, rushing to Diao Dezu's side. He kicked him toward Wan Lingkong and the others before charging forward again.

"Cough... be careful. This thunder beast's lightning is strange!" Diao Dezu looked worried, speaking to Luo Tian.

"Crack..." As Diao Dezu's words ended, another streak of azure lightning shot from the beast's mouth, striking Luo Tian.

"Ah..." At the moment the lightning hit Luo Tian, he inhaled sharply. Heavenly Dao energy roamed his body as three轮回不死 (Reincarnation Immortality) bodies activated, countering the heavenly Dao power.

"What's this heavenly Dao power? It's my turn!" Reincarnation Immortality activated, swiftly expelling the heavenly Dao energy from his body. His hands moved rapidly, releasing pure Epoch power that formed a massive whirlpool. It became the "Severing Heaven Seal," radiating immense power as it descended upon the thunder beast.

"Roar..." Terrifying thunder surged toward the beast, entering its mouth. A terrifying wave of energy brewed within it before erupting upon the "Severing Heaven Seal."

"Crack..." The thunder clashed with the seal, unleashing a violent wave that swept through the Thunder Sea.

The collision was apocalyptic. The "Severing Heaven Seal" shattered countless thunderbolts, crashing onto the beast's massive body.

"Incapable of a true Epoch Prime!" Luo Tian smiled, moving to the beast's side as it roared. His foot extended again, stomping heavily on its body.

"Boom..." The deafening sound echoed. White lightning shattered outward, sweeping in all directions.

"Seal the Soul!" Luo Tian extended his hand, extracting the beast's soul. He looked thoughtful, moving his hands to seal and store it.

"Absorb it! This lightning contains refined cultivation power!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Diao Dezu and the others.

Chapter 1416: The Land of Reversal

"Good!" Diao Dezu and the others didn't hesitate. They sat in the Thunder Sea, beginning to absorb the cultivation power imbued with thunder punishment.

"This beast is quite good. It can enhance our cultivation!" After refining for a while, Luo Tian replenished his consumption, smiling as he looked at the others.

Diao Dezu also recovered after refining. He stopped absorbing, as both he and Luo Tian were at Epoch Midway. There was no need to compete with the others for the beast's Epoch power, as it wasn't enough.

After a short while, the surging Epoch power was completely refined by Wan Lingkong, Sun Kemin, and Ren Hongzhe. Their auras strengthened.

"Let's continue forward. I wonder what this bastard will pull next!" Luo Tian sighed, stepping forward into the depths of the Thunder Sea.

Furious thunder poured down like a catastrophe. Luo Tian's group had now reached the depths of the Thunder Sea, where only terrifying thunder existed.

Yet as time passed, they felt the surrounding apocalyptic thunder weakening slightly.

"None... none?" After walking half an hour, they stopped, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"What is this place? Is it still the Thunder Sea Marsh?" Their cautious gazes fell upon a grey city appearing in their sight.

The entire city was deathly silent. Yet within the furious Thunder Sea Marsh, it seemed oddly strange. The city exuded a constant aura of gloom, making Luo Tian's group feel their spines tingle.

"The Land of Reversal!" Sun Kemin's face suddenly changed, his gaze cautious as he looked at the ominous city.

"How did such a place appear? I never expected there to be such a place in the world!" Sun Kemin's eyes gleamed with excitement, gazing at the ominous city.

"The Land of Reversal!" Luo Tian murmured softly. He had heard of the concept but never imagined such a place existed.

Thunder represents ultimate yang power. In this furious sea of thunder, there was an ominous city—unthinkable.

"This city must house a great sage's tomb. Otherwise, even with accumulated yin and ghostly forces, it couldn't form such a city!" Sun Kemin smiled, rubbing his hands. He was excited to have discovered an ancient tomb in the Thunder Sea.

"Are you going to rob a grave?" Luo Tian frowned. He didn't want to venture into such a dangerous place, unsure what awaited them inside.

"Relax. I'm an expert!" Sun Kemin nodded confidently, patting his chest.

"Roar..." Just as Sun Kemin's words ended, a series of roars echoed from the black city. Sun Kemin instinctively recoiled.

"I think we should take a detour!" Diao Dezu thought Sun Kemin was unreliable, showing signs of retreat.

"Believe in me!" Sun Kemin's eyes showed urgency. He didn't want to enter the cold city alone, addressing Luo Tian's group.

"Let's not go. It's too dangerous. Better to take a detour!" Luo Tian's group didn't even turn back, walking away.

"Fine, fine. Let's split the loot 80-20, I take 80!" Sun Kemin continued. But Luo Tian's group ignored him, continuing to walk away.

"70-30..."

"60-40..."

"Fine, fine. Let's split it evenly! Evenly, okay!" Sun Kemin showed reluctance, shouting again.

"Fine!" Luo Tian turned back, smiling and nodding. He had observed the ominous city earlier. A familiar aura lingered within it—this familiarity came from Jiang Sixi.

As for Sun Kemin, Luo Tian knew his greedy nature. He didn't want to run in vain and let Sun Kemin profit.

"Agreed!" Diao Dezu smiled, patting Sun Kemin's shoulder.

"Watch me!" Sun Kemin patted his shoulder. Then, he pulled out a stack of talismans, handing them to Luo Tian's group.

"These are my treasures. I use them for protection!" Sun Kemin handed them out, then hastily pasted the talismans onto his body.

"Sun Kemin, are you sick? You believe in these things? They're your own drawings! How crude!" Diao Dezu looked down, trying to throw away the talismans.

"Are you mocking my hard work?" Sun Kemin's face turned upset at Diao Dezu's actions.

"Are these talismans?" Luo Tian looked at the paper covered in messy drawings, his eyes filled with confusion.

"They were once great!" Luo Tian recalled Dongbo Xin's words. His face tightened, then he spoke softly: "Alright, let's keep them. They don't take up much space. Maybe they'll be useful later!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, not throwing them away despite their childish appearance.

"See? Luotian recognizes value! I'll tell you, after entering, you'll thank me!" Sun Kemin smiled confidently. He took out a compass-like object and led Luo Tian's group into the black city.

"Shiver..." Upon entering, Luo Tian's group felt a chill in their bodies, as if walking through the nine hells. They instinctively shivered.

"Hey... new people came..."

"Big brother, play with me!" A series of spine-chilling voices echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

"Maybe we should take a detour!" Diao Dezu's eyes flashed with urgency as he gazed into the black city. Yet, he saw nothing—no living beings, not even a spiritual soul.

"Open..." Luo Tian also activated his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes. But he saw no signs of life either.

"Did we enter a ghost city? Are these voices from the ghosts?" Diao Dezu asked softly, his voice cautious.

"Damn it! You're an Epoch Midway powerhouse. Why are you afraid of these things?" Sun Kemin looked down, addressing Diao Dezu.

"You don't know anything. The unknown is the most terrifying!" Diao Dezu cursed, but then straightened his shoulders and stood behind Luo Tian.

"Relax. Don't worry. Follow me, and you'll be safe!" Sun Kemin sneered, waving his hand. A talisman from his hand ignited and was thrown into the black sky. Then, like a mystic, he chanted.

"I almost believed it!" Diao Dezu looked at Sun Kemin's antics, nearly laughing out loud as he watched him dance.

"Disperse..." After Sun Kemin played for a while, the talisman burned out. He then shouted loudly.

The voice thundered, startling Luo Tian's group. Sun Kemin's voice echoed through the silent black city.

"Buzz..." An invisible wave radiated from Sun Kemin's hands. The next moment, the ghostly voices that had sounded like resentment vanished from Luo Tian's ears, causing them to startle slightly.

"I damn well didn't believe it!" Diao Dezu gasped, even Luo Tian's face showed disbelief.

"How about that?" Sun Kemin took out another talisman, reciting a chant and burning it quickly. He then brushed the ashes onto Luo Tian's group's heads.

"Done! Now you should be able to see!" Sun Kemin addressed Luo Tian's group. As Luo Tian looked around again, his mind was stunned.

The talismans that even his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes couldn't see had worked.

Dozens of figures appeared in Luo Tian's sight, moving about like real humans. The streets were identical to those of ordinary humans.

"These ghosts are powerful, but where did they come from? The surrounding area is filled with heavenly Dao thunder. How could ghosts enter here?" Diao Dezu's eyes showed confusion.

"These must be the great sage's disciples he brought in. After the sage died, he discovered this place of reversal and built this ghost city. Over time, it birthed these vengeful spirits!" Sun Kemin explained, speaking of things Luo Tian's group didn't understand.

"Just tell me, find the tomb or how to pass through this ghost city!" Diao Dezu addressed Sun Kemin, his voice impatient.

"Follow me!" Sun Kemin led Luo Tian's group. He held a compass, searching through the city. The vengeful spirits around them seemed unaware of Luo Tian's group, allowing them to breathe a sigh of relief.

Though these things didn't harm them much, if they were truly disturbed, it would be as difficult as the human-shaped lightning before.

"Ugh... ugh..." Just as Luo Tian was puzzled, a soft whimper echoed in their ears. They turned and saw a ragged little girl standing by the wall.

Chapter 1417: Soul-Eating Silkworm

"What's wrong?" Diao Dezu and the others looked at the little girl, following Luo Tian's gaze.

The girl had injuries on her body. She held a ragged doll, walking slowly along the black streets. Yet as she walked, surrounding vengeful spirits seemed to encounter a weakness, fleeing in all directions like avoiding plague.

"This girl isn't a vengeful spirit. She's truly alive!" Sun Kemin looked astonished. In this ghostly city filled with gloom, a living being had appeared—unsettling for them.

"Big brother... I think I know you!" The girl approached Luo Tian, gazing at him with a dazed expression. Her small finger tugged at the ragged doll.

"You..." Luo Tian's heart trembled, his eyes filled with disbelief. He couldn't recall meeting this girl before.

"You're my mother's husband. Can you take me to find my mother?" The girl spoke with innocence, addressing Luo Tian.

"Luotian..." Diao Dezu and the others looked oddly at Luo Tian. They hadn't expected to meet such a little girl who claimed him as her father.

"Can you clarify?" Luo Tian's eyes were confused. He felt no bloodline power on the girl, making it impossible for her to be his child.

"Buzz..." The girl's face was innocent. She pointed, and a scene appeared in Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian's face changed abruptly. His eyes were filled with excitement, then shifted to disbelief as he gazed at the girl.

"You... you... You're a Soul-Eating Silkworm!" Luo Tian stammered, surprised to meet the Soul-Eating Silkworm here. It was the little creature Jiang Sixi had subdued.

"Yes!" The girl's eyes sparkled with joy, rushing toward Luo Tian. Her expression was delighted as she clung to his body.

"Why have you become like this?" Luo Tian asked, gazing at the girl. He couldn't fathom why the Soul-Eating Silkworm had transformed this way.

"Human form!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. He recalled the Soul-Eating Silkworm's description—third transformation leads to human form. A human-form Soul-Eating Silkworm could even intimidate an Epoch Prime.

"My god! I've seen a human-form Soul-Eating Silkworm!" Diao Dezu and the others looked astonished, gazing at the girl clinging to Luo Tian. They clearly knew about the Soul-Eating Silkworm's legend.

"How is this possible? I saw a little girl with weak power, barely at the threshold of Epoch. What happened to make this little creature transform into human form?" Diao Dezu spoke softly, gazing at the girl on Luo Tian's shoulder.

"It must be this place's extreme yin energy. Every extreme yin place is a sacred ground for vengeful spirits and souls. These vengeful spirits are great nourishment for the Soul-Eating Silkworm!" Sun Kemin's eyes gleamed, his gaze burning as he looked at the girl-like Soul-Eating Silkworm.

"Ah! A human-form Soul-Eating Silkworm, growing to match Luotian's perfected Reincarnation Body!" Wan Lingkong and the others sighed, gazing at the harmless girl.

"Do you know where Jiang Sixi's group went?" Luo Tian's eyes were filled with excitement as he asked the Soul-Eating Silkworm about Gu Qianxue's group.

"They left... they went deeper and never returned to find me!" The girl spoke clearly, her eyes filled with a distant look.

"What!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly. He gazed at the city's depths, his heart filled with worry.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian spoke, his voice laced with urgency. He didn't know the four women's current situation.

"Yes!" Sun Kemin nodded, adjusting his compass. He led Luo Tian's group deeper into the city.

"There's a terrifying being inside! I'm scared!" The Soul-Eating Silkworm clung desperately to Luo Tian's shoulder, as if grasping a lifeline.

"Relax. I'm here!" Luo Tian smiled, comforting the Soul-Eating Silkworm. Clearly, the creature's mind wasn't fully developed—perhaps even less so than when he first met it.

A girl with incomplete mind, surviving in this eerie city that even made Luo Tian's group feel their spines tingle—what kind of experience was this? Yet, Luo Tian was more concerned about Gu Qianxue's group. With their personalities, they wouldn't have left the Soul-Eating Silkworm here alone. Something massive must have happened to them, forcing them to leave it behind.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's group walked forward until they reached the city's depths. They saw a series of tombs appearing before them.

"Eighty-one!" Sun Kemin's face was solemn. He didn't proceed further but stood there, his fingers moving constantly.

Eighty-one great tombs exuded dark energy, covering the path ahead. Luo Tian's group furrowed their brows.

"This is a great formation!" Wan Lingkong spoke, his voice cautious. Yet he looked at Sun Kemin.

"I can't decipher it. The yin energy is too heavy, obscuring the formation. You must do it!" Wan Lingkong spoke softly.

"Wherever we go, it's a trap!" Sun Kemin frowned. His gaze deepened, as if he had become another person.

"There's a chance for survival! Follow me!" Sun Kemin waved his hand, his voice solemn. He stepped into the formation.

"Roar..." After Sun Kemin led Luo Tian's group into the formation, a series of roars erupted from the dark energy. They surged toward Luo Tian's group.

"Shi..." Luo Tian extended his hand, surrounding them with seven-colored flames to prevent the cold energy from entering their bodies.

Numerous grey figures, seemingly strongly fearing the flames of Xiaqi, dared not approach.
