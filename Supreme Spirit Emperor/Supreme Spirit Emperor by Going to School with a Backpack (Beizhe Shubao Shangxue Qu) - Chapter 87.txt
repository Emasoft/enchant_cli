At this moment, Dan Yuyan's body was engulfed in an even more scorching flame. With every step she took, a dark footprint formed on the ground, radiating an intense heat.
Luo Tian was certain that even a single spark from this flame would be fatal to someone in the Refining Body Stage, or at the very least leave them severely injured. Even those in the Bone-Transforming Stage would not be able to withstand it.
"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed silently in his heart, never expecting Dan Yuyan to possess such a technique. This left him momentarily unprepared.
Yet, soon after, a deep sense of worry gripped Luo Tian. He knew that such powerful forces always carried consequences. Like the moment he became enraged, the Book of Epochs released an aura of slaughter, and each time after that, he had to rely on others to extract the bloodlust aura from him. Only through long periods of rest did he return to normal.
The formidable flame Dan Yuyan wielded was clearly beyond her own ability to summon. The most troubling thing for Luo Tian was the potential aftermath of Dan Yuyan's power. If it were severe, he would feel utterly ashamed to face Zheng Xin.
Thinking of this, Luo Tian's body flickered and he instantly appeared before Zheng Xin, delivering a punch filled with verdant energy, brimming with boundless vitality.
"Get out of the way... he's already dead! You still have to do this..." Dan Yuyan, seeing Luo Tian punch Zheng Xin, her face seemed about to bleed as she rushed toward Luo Tian with a frenzy of flames that seared through space.
She launched an attack at Luo Tian, the flame surging forward and instantly reaching his body. The terrifying temperature caused a faint scent of scorched hair to be felt even before the flame touched Luo Tian.
But just as the flames were about to touch Luo Tian, they abruptly halted. Dan Yuyan's face showed an expression of disbelief as she gazed at Zheng Xin, who lay on the ground. A look of joy then spread across her face.
Even Cold Qiuchan, who had been prepared to attack with full force, was filled with surprise. She dismissed the newly formed Qingmu Emperor's Blade in the sky.
To their eyes, Zheng Xin's body had instantly regenerated, appearing as if aged by centuries, but now it was growing younger. His face even showed a touch of redness.
"One hundred years... two hundred years..."
Zheng Xin's vitality surged to five hundred years under the astonished gazes of Cold Qiuchan and Dan Yuyan.
Luo Tian wiped his forehead, sweat dripping down. The fire was too terrifying; even with his formidable body, he doubted he could endure it for more than a minute.
He silently thanked himself for his fortune, then delivered another punch filled with verdant energy toward Zheng Xin, who had now regained five hundred years of vitality.
Under the joyous gazes of Dan Yuyan and Cold Qiuchan, Zheng Xin transformed into a youthful twenty-something. His eyes opened slowly in their gaze, revealing a look of confusion.
Chapter 426: The Essence of the Water Attribute
When Zheng Xin just awoke, his face showed confusion. Then he saw Luo Tian smiling at him. He immediately jumped up and rushed to Luo Tian's side, hugging him tightly: "Luo Tian! I never thought we would meet again in the cycle of rebirth!"
"Get off... you're already dead!" Luo Tian kicked Zheng Xin away and patted his body, feeling the goosebumps.
"Zheng Xin!" Dan Yuyan in the red flame saw Zheng Xin miraculously come back to life and shouted excitedly.
"Too hot!" Luo Tian thought in confusion, hearing someone call his name and turned to look.
But when Zheng Xin saw Dan Yuyan, wrapped in red flames and barely recognizable, his face changed: "Three Thousand Burning Flame!"
"Three Thousand Burning Flame?" Luo Tian looked at Dan Yuyan, confused and repeated the name. He didn't realize what it was.
"Damn it! Why did you release that fire!" Zheng Xin shouted angrily.
"I... I..." Dan Yuyan was stunned, having previously released the sealed flame to help Zheng Xin avenge. But now that Zheng Xin was completely fine, it was clear Luo Tian hadn't been possessed.
"This is my fault," Luo Tian said with a hint of guilt, seeing Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan looking at Dan Yuyan with heavy expressions. He realized he had definitely caused a big problem.
Hearing Luo Tian take the blame, Zheng Xin finally understood that he was alive and Luo Tian hadn't been possessed. He couldn't help but smile bitterly.
"Why are you so foolish!" Zheng Xin roared, his eyes bloodshot.
"Tell me what Three Thousand Burning Flame is! I'll think of a way!" Luo Tian felt regretful and asked Cold Qiuchan, who was by his side.
"You've really caused a big mess this time. If something happens to Yuyan, there won't be any place for you in Kunlun Mountain!" Cold Qiuchan said with helplessness, looking at Luo Tian.
"Stop talking! Tell me the way to put this fire out!" Luo Tian was filled with regret but had no choice. He needed to find a solution now.
"Three Thousand Burning Flame is one of the three ancestral flames of Dan Zong. The other two are held by an elder in the Soul-Subjugation Stage and Dan Zong's leader. Three Thousand Burning Flame was sealed within Yuyan when she was very young."
"With this flame, Yuyan was a top talent among her peers in both cultivation and alchemy. But there were drawbacks: the seal on her body could not be opened. Once it was, she would suffer a backlash from Three Thousand Burning Flame unless her strength reached Soul-Subjugation or higher." Cold Qiuchan explained to Luo Tian.
As she spoke, Dan Yuyan's flame became even redder, like a blood mist swirling around her. The scorching heat forced Luo Tian and Cold Qiuchan to retreat.
"Damn!" Zheng Xin's face showed a grim expression, recalling Dan Yuyan's anxious demeanor before his "death." He bit his teeth and took a few steps forward instead of retreating.
"Are you trying to die!" Dan Yuyan, whose face was obscured, shouted angrily and took steps back.
"I'm sorry. If it weren't for me, this situation wouldn't have happened. Please don't blame Luo Tian; he was helping me. If I die, I won't live on!" Zheng Xin said with a serious expression for the first time.
"Idiot... I don't blame anyone, only that I realized too late!" Dan Yuyan wanted to cry but the scorching air rapidly evaporated her body's moisture.
"Go, I don't blame anyone. My only wish is for you to live well; otherwise, my sacrifice would be in vain. If that's the case, I won't forgive you even as a ghost!" Dan Yuyan kept retreating and shouted. She could already feel the fire in her body becoming uncontrollable, and it would erupt soon.
When that happened, a hundred miles around would become a sea of fire, especially with the strong winds in Ji Feng Valley. The elemental affinity could even make Three Thousand Burning Flame more violent.
"Is there any way to put out this fire?" Luo Tian approached Zheng Xin, his voice filled with regret.
"There is a way... but it's too difficult to achieve!" Cold Qiuchan also approached Zheng Xin, the heat even causing her black veil to melt slightly.
"Tell me! Maybe it's possible!" Luo Tian growled, feeling the increasing wild aura of Three Thousand Burning Flame. He knew Dan Yuyan might not last long, so he urgently called out.
"Three Thousand Burning Flame is a rare flame of the world. To extinguish it, besides sealing it, one must gain its acceptance or find the legendary North Sea Xuan Jing in the North Sea to suppress it. Otherwise, it's impossible!" Cold Qiuchan explained.
Hearing Cold Qiuchan's words, Luo Tian and Zheng Xin showed disappointment. To them, both methods were like dreams.
"You two step back. I'll try!" Luo Tian indicated they should leave, asking to stay himself. After all, this was his fault, and he had to try his best.
"Luo Tian, be careful!" Cold Qiuchan knew she and Zheng Xin could do nothing. She was of the darkness and wood attributes, while Zheng Xin had wind attribute. Their energy would be a great nourishment for Three Thousand Burning Flame.
"I'm sorry, I was too smart. Don't worry; I'll fight to the death to save you!" Luo Tian sighed, his hands moving rapidly. His water attribute energy surged into his hands.
"It's useless. I don't blame you. Zheng Xin has a friend like you, so I can rest easy!" Dan Yuyan's face was calm within the red flame.
"Go..." A series of massive water dragons formed in Luo Tian's hands, rushing toward Three Thousand Burning Flame.
"The essence of the water attribute is to overcome with softness; fire and water are incompatible!" Luo Tian roared, sending the dragons toward Three Thousand Burning Flame.
"Hiss..." The sound of steam rising filled Ji Feng Valley, thick vapor appearing and dispersing with the wind.
Chapter 427: The Soul-Subduing Cauldron's Might
The powerful mist was dispersed. As Luo Tian consumed his formidable water attribute energy, Three Thousand Burning Flame around Dan Yuyan seemed to be slightly suppressed, becoming transparent.
"It's working!" Luo Tian's face lit up with joy. Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan also showed hope, for Luo Tian had created miracles before.
"Again!" Luo Tian's hands moved rapidly, sending water dragons toward Three Thousand Burning Flame. His other hand released a misty aura, the power of destruction repeatedly striking the red flames.
"Three Thousand Burning Flame is, in a way, life itself. The power of destruction should be able to harm it!" Luo Tian whispered, his hands leaving faint afterimages in the sky.
"Boom..." As if sensing an insult, Three Thousand Burning Flame surged three times its size, wrapping Dan Yuyan in red flames again.
Sweat dripped from Luo Tian's body, whether from the heat or overexertion.
Time passed slowly. Luo Tian's lips cracked, his face pale, but he seemed tireless, punching repeatedly. Though the water dragons were shrinking, they continued to rush toward Three Thousand Burning Flame.
"Give up! Take care of Zheng Xin for me, I beg you! Also, Qiuchan likes you; don't disappoint her!" Dan Yuyan smiled in the fire, showing a touch of sorrow.
"Quickly take them and leave! I can't control the burning flame anymore, go quickly!" Dan Yuyan shouted loudly.
"Crack..." A sound of something breaking echoed from Dan Yuyan's body.
"The seal is breaking!" Luo Tian roared, throwing the Soul-Subduing Cauldron into the air.
The Soul-Subduing Cauldron, now palm-sized in Luo Tian's hand, was his last hope. He hoped this powerful high-grade artifact could save Dan Yuyan.
"Three Lives Soul-Subduing!" Luo Tian roared, his voice like thunder echoing into the cauldron. He forcefully hurled it into the sky.
Thunderous sounds erupted, thunderous echoes resounded within the cauldron's body. A lightning bolt shot out and struck the burning flame fiercely.
Feeling the pressure of the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, the burning flame surged again. A sea of fire engulfed the cauldron.
"Subdue!" Luo Tian roared, his consciousness controlling the cauldron to change.
Under Cold Qiuchan and Zheng Xin's eyes, the cauldron transformed into a massive object, radiating an intense aura. It seemed to be able to subdue everything as thunder rolled across the sky, growing larger.
"Even Three Thousand Burning Flame! I'll subdue you!" Luo Tian roared, his powerful consciousness controlling the cauldron to press downward.
"Crash..." Feeling a strong crisis, Three Thousand Burning Flame erupted completely. Dan Yuyan's figure vanished instantly from the stunned gazes of Luo Tian and the others.
"No!" Zheng Xin roared, rushing toward the sea of fire.
"Come back! You must trust Luo Tian!" Cold Qiuchan shouted, tears flowing down her cheeks. Dan Yuyan and she were close friends; seeing this situation, Cold Qiuchan couldn't control herself. But rationally she still trusted Luo Tian, hoping he would create a miracle.
The Soul-Subduing Cauldron was thrown into the fire by Luo Tian's control. A massive dust cloud rose, obscuring their vision.
Luo Tian panted heavily. Controlling the Soul-Subduing Cauldron for just one strike had drained his consciousness completely. After marveling at the cauldron's power, he looked expectantly toward the dust cloud.
"Breath... " The fierce wind that had disappeared returned, and with it the sound of wind. As the dust dispersed with the wind, a bronze cauldron stood like a dominant ruler in the world. Complex patterns were carved on its body, appearing before their eyes.
Under the cauldron, a strange red flame seemed to be trapped under its legs, flickering constantly. It appeared to want to escape but could not.
"Is this Three Thousand Burning Flame?" Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion. Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan also arrived at Luo Tian's side, looking at the tiny red flame.
"It must have been injured by the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, and now it's weakened. It's perfect for absorption!" Cold Qiuchan said to Luo Tian.
"Luo Tian, is Yuyan okay?" Zheng Xin asked with trembling voice, not believing what he saw. His eyes showed hope as he awaited Luo Tian's answer.
Hearing Zheng Xin's question, Luo Tian's body trembled with a look of regret: "Zheng Xin, I'm sorry. I couldn't save Yuyan!"
"Cough... " Cold Qiuchan, hearing Luo Tian's words, her face turned pale. A mouthful of blood flowed from under her black veil.
Luo Tian's words, though they had prepared for it, still overwhelmed them when he said it aloud.
"Buzz..." Zheng Xin was struck by lightning, blood spurted from his chest into his mouth. He coughed it out, his face showing a pitiful expression. He fell to the ground, eyes gradually losing their light.
"Kid, don't get crazy yet. I haven't finished speaking. Your wife can still be saved!" Luo Tian quickly spoke to finish his words, seeing their reactions.
"Um... she's dead, but her soul is still in the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. As long as you find a new body or refine one, she can live again!" Luo Tian quickly said, restoring their eyes.
After that, Luo Tian pressed his hand and the Soul-Subduing Cauldron's lid opened slightly. A gray gas formed a human shape before them.
After doing this, Luo Tian didn't absorb the weak Three Thousand Burning Flame but stored it in the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.
The gray gas was weak, as if even the fierce winds of Ji Feng Valley could blow it away. It formed Dan Yuyan's shape.
"Yuyan..." Cold Qiuchan and Zheng Xin whispered, looking at the gray shadow with joy.
"Luo Tian, tell me what to do to save Yuyan! Even if I have to use all the strength of Ji Feng Valley, I'll save her!" Zheng Xin turned and said to Luo Tian.
Hearing Zheng Xin's words, Dan Yuyan's soul showed a smile and shook her head.
"Don't worry. Since I could retrieve your soul, I can make you live again!" Luo Tian's face showed strong confidence. He took off a small jade pendant from his waist.
This jade pendant was given to Luo Tian by his master, Zhang Daotian, and it was a symbol of disciples in his sect.
Chapter 428: The Conditions for Rebirth
Seeing Luo Tian's confidence, Zheng Xin showed a look of confusion. After all, Dan Yuyan's soul was there, so she wasn't completely dead.
Cold Qiuchan was different; she hadn't expected the Soul-Subduing Cauldron to be so powerful, able to forcibly extract a soul not in the Soul-Subjugation Stage.
Everyone knew that only those who reached the Soul-Subjugation Stage could leave a soul after death, allowing rebirth through possession.
Those below the Soul-Subjugation Stage couldn't leave a soul after death, not even a fragment. The Soul-Subduing Cauldron's ability alone was enough to be considered miraculous.
Zheng Xin didn't care about the details; as long as Dan Yuyan's soul was there, he would save her no matter what. Even if the cost was high, he could ask his father to beg the old monsters of Ji Feng Valley.
"Rebirth Jade?" Zheng Xin looked at Luo Tian's small jade pendant with confusion, surprised it was made of Rebirth Jade.
"Yes, indeed!" Luo Tian nodded and continued to speak to Dan Yuyan's soul in the sky: "Then, I'll have to委屈 you for a while. Stay in this Rebirth Jade temporarily!"
He smiled at Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan, and the gray Dan Yuyan nodded, transforming into a misty gas that landed on the Rebirth Jade.
As soon as it touched Dan Yuyan's soul, the jade emitted a glowing light. A mysterious soul power began to nourish Dan Yuyan's soul.
Seeing Dan Yuyan was fine, she disappeared into the Rebirth Jade. Zheng Xin sighed and asked: "Luo Tian, quickly tell me how to save Yuyan!"
Cold Qiuchan also looked at Luo Tian with curiosity. This was her first time encountering such a situation.
"To save your wife, you must find a body. You have two choices: one is to kill someone for her to possess, the other is to refine a body. As for refining a body, you don't need to worry too much; I have the method if you find enough materials!" Under Cold Qiuchan and Zheng Xin's gaze, Luo Tian spoke slowly.
"What materials are needed for refining?" Zheng Xin asked with confusion, wanting to refine a body for Dan Yuyan. After all, possessing someone might be awkward.
"It's nothing much; I have most of the materials. But one thing is very hard to find: blood, refined from over ten thousand people's blood!" Luo Tian looked at Zheng Xin with a serious expression.
"Whew..." Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan inhaled sharply, their faces showing shock. They hadn't expected the requirements for refining a body to be so high.
Ten thousand people's blood meant ten thousand lives. Ji Feng Valley could do it, but as a top sect in Kunlun Mountain, doing such an unpopular act would be too difficult. Moreover, even if they killed ten thousand people, Zheng Xin and Dan Yuyan's conscience would not allow them to do it.
"Ah... there's no choice but to find a bad woman for possession. I'm sorry, Yuyan!" Zheng Xin showed a helpless expression. Using ten thousand people's lives to get a body, he felt it was not worth it.
"This issue of blood... reminds me of someone!" Luo Tian's face showed coldness, his voice like a cold wind from the abyss.
"Who?" Cold Qiuchan and Zheng Xin asked together.
"Yang Huanyu." Luo Tian's voice was cold as he answered, recalling the young master of the Tian Shi Sect.
" Him?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan's faces turned cold.
Then Cold Qiuchan showed a look of realization. Yang Huanyu, as the young master of Tian Shi Sect, often committed mass killings. He must have had ten thousand people's blood.
Luo Tian remembered that Yang Huanyu once set up a terrifying array, consuming millions of souls and blood.
"So we should go find him quickly!" Zheng Xin couldn't wait, grabbed Luo Tian's arm and headed toward the outer part of Ji Feng Valley.
"Wait! Don't you need to tell your father?" Luo Tian quickly asked.
"Don't be silly, I want to die! If this incident is exposed, not only me but you and Yuliling Sect would be involved. Dan Zong's power is no less than yours!" Zheng Xin explained.
"So this must be kept secret! We three must sneak out of Ji Feng Valley and find Yang Huanyu's location!" Zheng Xin didn't wait for their response but outlined the next plan.
"Yang Huanyu isn't in Kunlun Mountain, he's in Beichang County!" Cold Qiuchan took out the jade pendant of Yuliling Sect, looking puzzled.
"How do you know that?" Zheng Xin asked.
"Nothing, my father just sent me a message!" Cold Qiuchan said, looking at Luo Tian.
Luo Tian took out the jade token of Yuliling Sect and nodded, sighing inwardly: "Beichang County. Although my strength is still lacking, it should be okay!"
"Okay, let's go to Beichang County!" Zheng Xin said without waiting for their agreement and strode toward the entrance of Ji Feng Valley.
Luo Tian and Cold Qiuchan shook their heads slightly, flickered their bodies, and followed Zheng Xin.
Not long after the three disappeared, a corpse on the ground suddenly opened its eyes, looking at the direction where Luo Tian and the others vanished with a dark expression: "Youth! Youth! Wait for me, I'll devour your soul soon!"
After saying that, the corpse moved and disappeared from the spot toward the depths of Ji Feng Valley.
As they left, the corpses on the ground and the scorching heat remained, reminding people of a fierce battle.
"Stop..." Zheng Xin and Luo Tian stopped as they ran through Ji Feng Valley, Zheng Xin blocking Luo Tian and Cold Qiuchan.
"My father has arrived!" Zheng Xin's face showed a serious expression, telling Luo Tian and Cold Qiuchan.
"What should we do? We'll be discovered!" Cold Qiuchan showed surprise and whispered.
Hearing their words, Luo Tian took out three leaves of Fengting Tree from his storage ring and handed them to Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan, smiling: "Take these and hide!"
They saw Luo Tian take out the leaves of Fengting Tree, showing a slight surprise but didn't think much. The three flickered their bodies and hid behind a small hill.
At the same time, Luo Tian's powerful consciousness wrapped around them. Unless someone with Soul-Subjugation Stage consciousness could sense their presence.
Chapter 429: Leaving Kunlun Mountain
Not long after the three hid, wind sounds arose. Several figures appeared at the spot where Luo Tian and the others had stood. The leader was Zheng Xin's father, Zhao Hongsheng, and his older brother Zheng Tianxiao. Behind them were several elders of the Yuanling Stage.
"Hmm? I clearly felt Xin'er and Qiuchan's energy, but it vanished in an instant!" Zhao Hongsheng showed a deep confusion.
"Father, did you sense it wrong? Let's go check the incident site!" Zheng Tianxiao showed a worried expression and said to Zhao Hongsheng.
Zhao Hongsheng furrowed his brows, using his Yuanling Stage consciousness to scan the area within several miles.
The elders behind Zhao Hongsheng also extended their consciousness, scanning the area.
Several powerful consciousnesses swept over the place where Luo Tian and the others were hiding, causing Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan to sweat cold.
Luo Tian's lips slightly curled up; his consciousness was already comparable to Yuanling Stage. With the Fengting Tree leaves covering them, Zhao Hongsheng and others would not find their presence unless they searched thoroughly.
But it was unrealistic for Zhao Hongsheng, an elder of Yuanling Stage, to find three children in the Bone-Transforming Stage by sight.
After scanning for a while, Zhao Hongsheng asked Zheng Tianxiao: "Let's go see it!"
With Zhao Hongsheng's command, the others flickered their bodies and followed Zheng Tianxiao toward the spot emitting a scorching heat.
...
"Breath..." After Zhao Hongsheng's group had been gone for a long time, Zheng Xin sighed and gave Luo Tian a thumbs-up. He thought silently: "If my father found out I was with Yuyan, and she only had a soul left, even if Dan Zong didn't come after us, my father wouldn't forgive me!"
"Let's go. If they don't find our tracks, it would be troublesome if they met us again!" Luo Tian spoke softly without retrieving the Fengting Tree leaves, urging Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan.
Zheng Xin nodded,收回 the hand that had given out the Fengting Tree leaves and ran ahead with Cold Qiuchan and Luo Tian toward an exit he knew.
Zheng Xin was fortunate that his older brothers often took him to play in the outer part of Ji Feng Valley, and only he and his two brothers knew this exit.
It was fortunate that they didn't cause any danger, as otherwise they would have alerted the Ji Feng Valley sect.
No danger occurred; the three successfully exited Ji Feng Valley without even catching their breath. To ensure safety, they also changed their appearances and rushed toward the exit of Kunlun Mountain.
Cold Qiuchan had once sneaked out of Kunlun Mountain, so she naturally knew the exits. After eight days of traveling day and night, they finally arrived at the exit position of Kunlun Mountain.
As Luo Tian saw the almost identical mountain stones, he felt a shadow, recalling when he first entered Kunlun Mountain and Gu Lei was hit with a big bump.
Seeing Luo Tian hesitate to move forward, Zheng Xin and Cold Qiuchan were confused, looking at Luo Tian's twitching mouth.
"Ah... ha... you go first..." Luo Tian couldn't say his real thoughts, so he awkwardly smiled and spoke to Zheng Xin.
"Strange..." Zheng Xin furrowed his brows, kicked the ground and slammed into the mountain stone-like exit.
"Boom..." A loud sound echoed, Zheng Xin's body stepped back several steps, and a big bump quickly grew on his head.
"Qiuchan, sister, please be more accurate next time! I tell you, it's lucky it was me. If it were a girl like you, how ugly would that be... I tell you..." Zheng Xin's face showed an unhappy expression, looking at Cold Qiuchan and speaking.
Zheng Xin finally understood why Luo Tian didn't go first.
Luo Tian saw Zheng Xin step back and showed a look of "I knew it," looking at Cold Qiuchan.
Under her black veil, Cold Qiuchan's face was hot but her expression didn't show it. She pointed again to a position, voice still cold: "Here, this time it's definitely correct!"
"Luo Tian, now it's your turn!" Zheng Xin's eyebrows twitched and said to Luo Tian.
"Zheng Xin, are you doubting Qiuchan?" Luo Tian's face showed seriousness.
"No, but if you say that, are you questioning Qiuchan?" Zheng Xin saw Luo Tian speak and continued to talk.
Luo Tian helplessly patted his forehead, showing bitterness. He had forgotten Zheng Xin wasn't Gu Lei; Zheng Xin's mouth was truly unmatched. It would be a mistake to argue with him.
Indeed, under Zheng Xin's endless talk and spittle flying, Cold Qiuchan's eyes were like two lightning bolts looking at Luo Tian.
Luo Tian instinctively shivered and closed his eyes, showing a determined expression but found Cold Qiuchan's gaze even colder.
"Difficult to please!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, forcing a smile and stepping forward in the direction Cold Qiuchan pointed.
"Buzz..." The fluctuation of energy arose, and Luo Tian felt a slight joy, thinking Cold Qiuchan had experience. This time she found the position correctly.
"Boom..." Luo Tian's body appeared in mid-air, landing steadily on the ground.
Just as Luo Tian landed, Cold Qiuchan and Zheng Xin's bodies appeared beside him.
"We're out! Ha ha, this is my first time leaving Kunlun Mountain!" Zheng Xin laughed.
"Hmph... a flower in a greenhouse..." A voice like a nightingale echoed in Zheng Xin's ears.
"Ha ha... Yuyan, you haven't left either, right? When you recover your body, we'll go out and have fun before returning to Kunlun Mountain, okay!" Zheng Xin heard the voice and showed a touch of joy. This voice was none other than Dan Yuyan's.
The Nourishing Soul Jade was a tool to nourish souls, and after being nurtured for these days, Dan Yuyan's soul had fully recovered. She could now speak.
Throughout the journey, Zheng Xin and Dan Yuyan's relationship rapidly deepened, becoming hot. Although Dan Yuyan often teased Zheng Xin, he felt as if honey was poured into his heart. As long as Dan Yuyan spoke to him, he wore a happy expression.
Luo Tian was speechless, watching Zheng Xin like a lovesick fool hugging his jade pendant and kissing it. He thought to himself, should he retrieve his master's jade pendant?
"Are you gods?" Just as Luo Tian and the others were chatting, a trembling voice echoed in their ears.
Five chapters are sent, thank you for your support!
Chapter 430: Returning to Li Shui City
Hearing the voice, the three turned their eyes toward its source. A child's face showed innocence, looking at Luo Tian and the others with wide eyes. To the child, they were like gods.
Seeing the child's appearance, Luo Tian and the others smiled. Dan Yuyan restrained her voice to avoid scaring people.
"Child, can you tell me where we are?" Zheng Xin smiled and asked the child.
"Enough! Don't ask, hurry up and go to Li Shui City first, then head to Beichang County from there!" Cold Qiuchan frowned. She had entered Kunlun Mountain from here before, so she knew the nearest place was Li Shui City.
Luo Tian gave the child a piece of energy stone and said softly: "Child, remember not to stay here anymore. It's dangerous!"
It wasn't that Luo Tian was exaggerating; the area around Kunlun Mountain was indeed unsuitable for children. If a child accidentally entered Kunlun Mountain, it would be extremely dangerous.
After advising the child, who looked at the energy stone as if it were a precious treasure and ran away with his legs, the three disappeared from the child's sight.
"Surely they are gods! I need to go home and tell my grandfather!" The child, holding the energy stone tightly in his small hands, ran away.
Luo Tian and the others moved at top speed, arriving at Li Shui City in three days.
As they entered Li Shui City, Luo Tian patted his storage ring and released the dragon baby who had been rebelling.
Previously, to avoid Zhao Hongsheng's consciousness, Luo Tian had no choice but to store the dragon baby in his storage ring. The dragon baby's aura of a dragon emperor could not be suppressed by Fengting Tree, and he had been running constantly, fearing the dragon baby's mischief.
Now that they were in Li Shui City, Luo Tian released the dragon baby.
The moment the dragon baby came out, his face showed a pout, obviously not used to being in the storage ring for so long.
But soon after, he was attracted by the familiar scene and his black eyes gleamed with light. He even drooled, forgetting that Luo Tian had kept him in the storage ring for over ten days.
"Ha ha... I'm back!" The dragon baby put his hands on his hips, looking down at them.
Luo Tian and the others helplessly patted their foreheads, knowing the dragon baby would start collecting shiny things again.
Before they could react, the dragon baby disappeared from their sight and shouted loudly, replaying the scene of a year ago. This time, however, it was Luo Tian and Zheng Xin following the dragon baby, while Cold Qiuchan went to a hotel for rest.
