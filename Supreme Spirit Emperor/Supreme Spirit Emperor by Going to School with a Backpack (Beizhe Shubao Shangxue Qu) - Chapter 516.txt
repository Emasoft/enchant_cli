“Master of the Hall, what shall we do?” Zhao Tiecheng and Zhao Tiancheng gathered around Luo Tian as countless disciples were devoured by the colossal serpent, their voices trembling.

“Form a grand formation again!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with ruthless determination. If they failed to break Guiyuan Sect’s formation, their position would be dire; relying solely on his own strength was insufficient to shatter Guiyuan Sect’s formation.

“What?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the disciples of the Disciplinary Hall were stunned, bewildered as to why he would form another formation when they had suffered heavy losses. The Giant Serpent Formation was clearly no match for the linear snake formation.

“Trust me!” Luo Tian roared, leaping into the air again. The Disciplinary Hall disciples and numerous others hesitated before following suit, and in an instant, the Giant Serpent Formation reassembled.

Yet this time, the giant was no longer ten thousand zhang tall but had transformed into five thousand zhang—half its former size.

“What does the Young Master intend? Why form another formation?” Everyone’s faces bore confusion, puzzled by Luo Tian’s decision to reassemble the Giant Serpent Formation.

“Die!” A golden serpent, radiating coldness, slaughtered countless disciples of Shenglong Sect, slithering toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Crush them this time—don’t give them a chance to break the formation!” On the serpent’s head stood a youth, his face cold.

This was Chen Tianyuan, the Dao Disciple of Guiyu Sect and a candidate for the next sect master.

The other four serpents continued to massacre Shenglong Sect disciples, their might overwhelming. Each movement of their massive bodies claimed countless lives.

“Hum…” The bloodstained serpent appeared before Luo Tian’s group in an instant.

“Rupture Sky Spear!” Luo Tian bellowed, the spear’s hum echoing as a golden light shot from his giant’s heart. A surge of dragon-like aura followed, and a golden dragon erupted into view, radiating immense pressure.

“This aura… it’s a superior divine weapon!” At the very moment of the spear’s emergence, all present were momentarily stunned.

“Already using a superior divine weapon? How will Shenglong Sect fight now? Do they have more hidden cards?” The sect masters of the Middle Heavens exchanged puzzled glances, watching the golden Rupture Sky Spear expand.

“Hum…” The golden spear appeared in the giant’s hand, and with a single step, the giant advanced toward the approaching serpent.

A giant matching a True Immortal’s late stage or peak could fully unleash a superior divine weapon. Glittering light flashed, and the golden spear’s tip pierced the serpent’s head.

“Damn it…” Chen Tianyuan’s face darkened as a wave of danger surged through his mind.

“He intends to kill me!” Chen Tianyuan instantly realized Luo Tian’s plan—his position was the eye of the serpent formation. Killing him would shatter the array.

“Disperse!” Chen Tianyuan roared, ignoring surrounding Guiyu Sect disciples and retreating swiftly.

“Hum…” A sharp aura sliced through the sky, and as the disciples of Guiyu Sect failed to comprehend what had happened, the formation collapsed abruptly. They were severed by the sharp aura, turning into a cloud of blood mist.

“Cough… cough…” Chen Tianyuan stood ten thousand zhang away, his face pale. He had been moments from death; if he had delayed another breath, he would have been annihilated.

“Damn it! A superior divine weapon—this is a superior divine weapon! Shenglong Sect doesn’t play by the rules, using it before even the final card!” Chen Tianyuan’s mind roared as he watched his fallen disciples, feeling a pang of sorrow.

“Move!” Luo Tian did not pursue Chen Tianyuan but turned his gaze to the other serpents.

“Everyone scatter!” Luo Tian bellowed, and the giant advanced toward a nearby serpent.

At that moment, the serpent still raged, crushing Shenglong Sect disciples relentlessly. Though Shenglong Sect disciples fought back, causing some losses to Guiyu Sect’s disciples, the disparity in casualties was staggering.

“Behold! The Young Master has truly shattered this serpent formation!” Seeing the five thousand zhang giant approaching, the oppressed Shenglong Sect disciples erupted in joy.

Chapter 1983: Chen Tianyuan (Heavenly Origin)

“Boom… boom…” The colossal giant, like a meat grinder on the battlefield, wielded the golden Rupture Sky Spear with an overwhelming aura. It pierced through four serpents and killed a Heavenly Immortal’s peak who had failed to escape, instantly annihilated.

With the serpent formation shattered, Guiyu Sect lost countless disciples, and Shenglong Sect regained numerical superiority.

“Young Master’s might!” The Shenglong Sect disciples cried, their eyes burning as they gazed at the giant standing amidst heaven and earth. Without Luo Tian’s breakthrough, their fate would have been slaughter.

“Kill!” The Shenglong Sect disciples surged forward like men infused with aphrodisiacs, charging at Guiyu Sect disciples.

“Boom!” The giant collapsed, and the Shenglong Sect disciples who had formed the array turned pale. Having shattered four serpent formations in succession, their exhaustion was immense—Luo Tian himself was drained, for the superior divine weapon had been fully unleashed.

With the serpent formation broken, the battlefield turned chaotic. Rebuilding formations was nearly impossible; no one could afford to be careless, for death lurked in every moment.

Dead bodies littered the battlefield, blood-red torrents spreading into the Huantian Sea. Blood mist filled the air, and the world reeked of blood.

Ye Liangchen and others stood behind the sect masters, their faces pale as they watched the battlefield’s monstrous carnage. Waves of nausea rolled through them.

“Everyone, follow me!” Luo Tian brandished the spear, with Zhao Tiecheng and Zhao Tiancheng at his back. He wiped blood from his face; though weakened, he pressed on, leading the charge against Guiyu Sect disciples.

The battlefield momentarily stalemated. Regardless of their cultivation levels, both sects’ disciples faced the possibility of death. Some perished before they could even fear, annihilated by ferocious martial arts.

True Immortal battles were equally stalemated; corpses fell from the sky intermittently, but no one paused to check who had died. The Shenglong Sect currently held the upper hand.

The Huantian Sea roared violently, and nearly a hundred sect masters and prodigies watched the two sects’ life-and-death clash.

“Guiyu Sect fights with their backs to the wall; Shenglong Sect fights with self-sacrifice. The victor remains uncertain!”

“Yet it seems Shenglong Sect holds an edge, for they’ve already unleashed a superior divine weapon!”

“According to past battles, the side that reveals their hidden cards earliest often meets defeat,” Ye Wudao remarked, his voice tinged with admiration.

Hearing Ye Wudao’s words, Ye Liangchen’s expression darkened: “Father, please save Tiange at the crucial moment. He once saved my life in the Lower Heavens, and Star River Mansion found its path because of him. Moreover, Nan Gong Yuching and others joined Star River Mansion due to Luo Tian’s strength. Their talent is well-known to you!”

Ye Liangchen’s voice trembled with urgency. He cared little for others’ safety, but after Luo Tian had shielded him from the Ghost King’s attack, he had accepted Luo Tian as a brother.

“Hmph. This boy is commendable; he knows gratitude. Originally, he could have joined Star River Mansion but chose to remain in Shenglong Sect. If danger arises, I’ll intervene to save him,” Ye Wudao spoke softly, calming Ye Liangchen and Nan Gong Yuching.

Cries of battle echoed as Luo Tian wielded the Rupture Sky Spear, a bloodstained war god. The superior divine weapon unleashed terrifying power; each strike claimed countless Guiyu Sect disciples.

Behind Luo Tian, Zhao Tiecheng and others followed, their ten thousand Disciplinary Hall disciples elite warriors. Ten thousand men cut through the battlefield like a blade, carving a path.

On the other side, Guiyu Sect’s Dao Disciple Chen Tianyuan led his sect’s elite disciples in relentless combat. The two forces clashed like arrows, tearing through the battlefield toward each other.

“Who is that man?” Their gazes fell on Luo Tian and Chen Tianyuan. They knew Chen Tianyuan, but Luo Tian was a stranger to many.

“That man is Shenglong Sect’s Young Master, Luo Tian!” Someone spoke, drawing the attention of many in the Middle Heavens.

“Unexpectedly, such a prodigy emerged from the Lower Heavens!” Their faces bore admiration as they watched Luo Tian wielding the Rupture Sky Spear.

“Luo Tian!” Hearing the murmurs, several elders’ faces turned shocked, their eyes flashing with intense hostility.

“The Seer once said the one who killed my grandson would join the Heavenly Contest. Recently, Guiyu Sect reported that the killer was named Luo Tian!” A purple-robed elder stood among the crowd. This man was Chang Ziyang’s grandfather, Chang Youde.

Other elders also bore murderous intent, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian—yet they remained默契 (tacitly) silent.

The Heavenly Contest had been decreed by the Nine Divine Mountains: no outsiders could partake. No one dared defy this rule.

Ye Wudao merely wished to protect Luo Tian with his reputation; if all else failed, he would leverage Star River Mansion’s pressure to force Guiyu Sect not to kill Luo Tian.

Though this challenged the Nine Divine Mountains’ authority, Star River Mansion was no pushover. Ranked third among the Hundred Sects in the Middle Heavens, Star River Mansion was also under the shadow of the Nine Divine Mountains. Star River Mansion relied on Bountiful Heaven Mountain; if it faced trouble, Bountiful Heaven Mountain would not ignore it and might even intervene to mediate the other mountains.

Other factions, however, were different—since their status was inferior to Star River Mansion, like Guiyu Sect, they could be eradicated at will.

Time passed slowly; the battlefield grew more brutal. Luo Tian led the Disciplinary Hall’s forces into Guiyu Sect disciples’ ranks.

“Kill that youth; our morale will soar!” Luo Tian observed his exhausted Disciplinary Hall forces. As they pressed deeper into Guiyu Sect’s domain, the Disciplinary Hall suffered heavy losses—ten thousand disciples now numbered five thousand. He gazed at Chen Tianyuan, who continued striking.

Five thousand men were but a drop in the ocean, yet they terrified Guiyu Sect disciples. Within minutes, countless Guiyu Sect disciples fell to their blades.

“Kill him; our sect’s morale will soar!” Chen Tianyuan’s eyes also burned with madness, sharing Luo Tian’s goal.

“Tianyuan, wield the superior divine weapon and slay that youth!” A True Immortal peak elder above, surpassing Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu, waved his hand. A streak of light flashed, and a blade’s aura surged toward Chen Tianyuan.

“Yes!” Chen Tianyuan’s face lit with joy. Previously, he had attempted to break through the crowd and kill Luo Tian but hesitated upon seeing his superior divine weapon, avoiding their锋芒 (sharp edge).

“Hum…” The blade severed space, claiming countless Shenglong Sect disciples’ lives before landing in Chen Tianyuan’s grasp.

“Return Sea Blade!”

“Guiyu Sect has finally unleashed a superior divine weapon?” The Middle Heavens’ sect masters and prodigies gasped, watching Chen Tianyuan’s emerald blade.

At the moment he grasped it, a confident aura radiated from Chen Tianyuan. His body exuded overwhelming authority; invisible winds surged outward, as if he stood alone against ten thousand foes.

“Follow me! Kill Shenglong Sect’s Young Master!” Chen Tianyuan roared, raising his blade.

“Kill!” His elite disciples echoed, their eyes ablaze with fervor, gazing at the imposing Chen Tianyuan.

If Luo Tian was Shenglong Sect’s pillar, then Chen Tianyuan was Guiyu Sect’s hope. As long as he lived, Guiyu Sect would not fall—this confidence was built over years of accumulation.

Chen Tianyuan had risen within Guiyu Sect, surpassing even the Middle Heavens’ prodigies. Like Luo Tian, he had proven himself through strength.

“Finally daring to confront head-on?” Luo Tian killed a Heavenly Immortal mid-stage, his lips curling into a smile as he faced Chen Tianyuan’s charge.

“Want to kill me, Luo Tian? Your blade isn’t sharp enough!” Luo Tian sneered, raising the Rupture Sky Spear toward Chen Tianyuan.

“Kill!” Five thousand Disciplinary Hall disciples roared, their overwhelming aura following Luo Tian.

This battle was Shenglong Sect’s trial and the Disciplinary Hall’s trial—since they were all elites.

Though other halls of Shenglong Sect did not voice it, their discontent was palpable. This battle had fully showcased the Disciplinary Hall’s prowess.

Luo Tian had also earned their trust; that spear-wielding youth stood like a mountain, shielding them from countless foes.

Though they had infiltrated Guiyu Sect’s ranks and faced endless attacks, they did not fear. Their souls remained because of the youth before them.

“We of the Dragon Heaven Hall will not lose to the Disciplinary Hall!” A Heavenly Immortal peak youth roared, his voice wild as he led his hall into Guiyu Sect’s ranks.

“We of the Earth Dragon Hall are all men!” The other three halls also roared, their morale soaring under Luo Tian’s leadership.

Shenglong Sect’s five halls, like five blades, pierced Guiyu Sect’s formation. Simultaneously, Guiyu Sect roared as strong warriors met them head-on.

Chapter 1984: Slaying the Dao Disciple

The war continued, and after half an hour of fighting, Luo Tian and his Disciplinary Hall forces finally reached Chen Tianyuan.

With the other halls’ infiltration, the Disciplinary Hall’s pressure lessened slightly but remained significant.

“Kill!” Luo Tian and Chen Tianyuan met, both blood-red-eyed, exchanging no words. They raised their weapons and clashed head-on.

“Finally, Shenglong Sect’s Young Master has met Guiyu Sect’s Dao Disciple!” The Middle Heavens’ people watched the confrontation, their eyes alight. They knew if Luo Tian killed Chen Tianyuan, Shenglong Sect’s chances would soar; the reverse was equally true.

“Crack!” Thunder clashed as the Rupture Sky Spear met the emerald blade. Both men recoiled, but Luo Tian halted after a few steps while Chen Tianyuan’s face paled, colliding with several Guiyu Sect elites.

“Master Dao Disciple was repelled!” Some of the Guiyu Sect disciples fighting the Disciplinary Hall witnessed this, their faces stunned.

“Hmph! Fighting that kid is suicide!” Above, Xuan Dan fought a Heavenly Immortal mid-stage. He had previously marked Luo Tian with an imprint to guard against any mishaps.

He knew Luo Tian could subdue Nie Sheng, and if it were a one-on-one fight, Xuan Dan was certain no Middle Heavens prodigy could match Luo Tian. Those who could were fewer than five fingers.

“Strong!” Chen Tianyuan’s mind was awestruck; he had underestimated Luo Tian.

“Again!” Chen Tianyuan would not yield, for yielding meant dire consequences.

“Sea Sky Strike!”

A wave of water sounds surged from Chen Tianyuan’s body, and his emerald blade absorbed the澎湃仙气 (surging divine energy), unleashing a colossal blade aura toward Luo Tian.

“Boom… boom… boom…” A vacuum formed between them, all engulfed by the wave-like attacks.

“Blade technique?” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened as he watched the emerald blade aura. His Rupture Sky Spear radiated golden light.

Divine energy surged, and the spear transformed into a golden dragon, colliding with the emerald blade.

“Crack!” The clash echoed; this time both were evenly matched, as Luo Tian’s spear technique was not a True Immortal martial art but purely his physical strength.

“Kill!” After the clash, Luo Tian pushed off the ground, rushing into the swirling energy. He appeared before Chen Tianyuan in an instant, using the spear as a club to strike him.

“Get out of my way!” Chen Tianyuan roared, wielding his blade to meet the golden afterimage.

The clash echoed again; Chen Tianyuan’s legs bent, and he was smashed into the ground, creating a deep pit.

“Strong! This kid’s physical strength is变态 (abnormal), and his divine energy is equally formidable!” The Middle Heavens’ people watched Chen Tianyuan, battered and helpless, gasping in awe.

“This kid’s technique was跟不上 (not up to par), but Chen Tianyuan’s Sea Sky Strike is a True Immortal mid-stage technique,” the sect masters murmured, watching Luo Tian’s renewed Rupture Sky Spear.

“If he had been born in the Middle Heavens’ sects, he would surely have a place among their prodigies,” the masters marveled.

The spear images kept appearing, and Luo Tian gave Chen Tianyuan no respite, his aura radiant. Each strike was relentless.

“Damn it!” Chen Tianyuan spat blood, his arms feeling alien, his legs trembling. He felt if he didn’t have the Return Sea Blade, he would be killed by Luo Tian’s few strikes.

“Not a wasted effort!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, his arms seemingly limitless in strength. He recalled training the chaotic hammer technique under Lu Chong and now saw Chen Tianyuan as a block of iron.

“Clang… clang…” The crisp sounds echoed, each louder than the last. Luo Tian seemed to enter a rhythm, his strikes carrying unique patterns that spread waves outward.

“Awakening the Dao’s resonance!” The Middle Heavens’ sect masters were again stunned, sensing these waves.

“I’ve entered his rhythm; I must break free!” Chen Tianyuan’s mind panicked, his body trembling violently. He tried to escape but felt bound by surrounding Dao laws, unable to break free.

“Hum…” Finally, Luo Tian broke through some constraint, his golden spear image severed space, striking Chen Tianyuan with overwhelming might.

“Two times stronger!” At the moment of the sudden strike, Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze sharp.

“Still more comfortable with the Rupture Sky Spear!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up; he finally understood the chaotic hammer technique.

“Heaven and Earth Unite!” Chen Tianyuan roared, sensing the immense danger as the spear fell. His eyes flashed with madness; if he didn’t fight, he would die.

Emerald divine energy surged from Chen Tianyuan’s body, forming a vast emerald sky. Simultaneously, his body twisted into yellow earth, spreading across the ground. The emerald sky descended into the yellow earth.

“Boom…” At the same time, the spear image struck the ground with supreme power, the crackling sound echoing across heaven and earth. The battlefield within ten thousand zhang around Luo Tian stilled.

“Crack!” The crackling sound rose, the Rupture Sky Spear deeply embedded in the ground. Cracks spread from the spear’s tip.

“Cough… cough…” Wind swept, and the yellow earth dusted with emerald light rose, forming a sand sculpture of Chen Tianyuan.

Life surged instantly; Chen Tianyuan’s face was pale, devoid of blood, like a paper figure. He coughed violently, his body staggering, appearing ready to collapse.

“With my blood, I invoke the Return Sea Blade—cut you into oblivion!” Chen Tianyuan roared, raising the blade with madness.

“Hum…” The next moment, the emerald blade descended abruptly, slicing through Chen Tianyuan’s head as if to cleave it.

“Oblivion Strike!” The Middle Heavens’ prodigies watched Chen Tianyuan’s actions, their eyes alight.

“Chen Tianyuan is risking everything; this Oblivion Strike harms both sides. Even if it kills Luo Tian, he will be severely weakened and vulnerable in this chaotic battlefield, unable to survive!” A youth spoke.

“He knows he can’t match Luo Tian and unleashes his ultimate strike to kill him, a mutual destruction. This might fully ignite Guiyu Sect’s morale and turn the tide!” A sect master remarked.

“Why? He could have easily escaped!” Young prodigies puzzled, gazing at their elders.

“Do you know the fate of the last sect that failed in the Heavenly Contest?”

“The entire sect was annihilated, no survivors. The victors needed no captives! Thus, only victory brings survival. Even if you don’t die, you’ll be hunted by all Middle Heavens sects! There’s nowhere to hide! This is the rule set by the Nine Divine Mountains!” A sect master spoke.

Most present sects had participated in the Heavenly Contest, including Star River Mansion, but they were all victors. Thus, they stood here now.

These sects had also been victorious with full strength, securing their triumph. Some of these sects were originally from the Lower Heavens and had ascended to the Middle Heavens through fierce battles. Now, witnessing this brutal fight, they felt awe—some were lucky, others relied on sheer strength to produce prodigies who broke through into the Middle Heavens.

Cruel, hearing the sect master’s words, the prodigies bore admiration. Perhaps they would participate in the next Heavenly Contest or even become sect masters leading it.

Chen Tianyuan stood there, his head cracked, blood flowing down. His life rapidly faded; his gray soul turned to ash, merging into the Return Sea Blade.

In an instant, the emerald blade turned blood-red, and a towering red light surged upward. The Return Sea Blade descended under the stunned gazes of all, its overwhelming pressure descending.

“Hum…” The blade’s aura sliced through the sky, carving a blood-red fissure toward Luo Tian.

This strike had drained Chen Tianyuan’s nearly nine-tenths of his life and soul. It was his ultimate strike, capable of wounding a True Immortal early stage, killing any Heavenly Immortal peak or even half-step True Immortal.

“Strong, but not enough!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness, a smile on his lips. His hand glowed with light, and a dragon emerged from his grasp, forming into a golden bow.

The golden bow’s string and body were adorned with intricate patterns, radiating powerful waves.

“This bow?” At the moment Luo Tian revealed it, all eyes paused, their expressions stunned.

“Hum…” Divine light flashed; a golden arrow凝聚 (coalesced) in Luo Tian’s hand, placed on the bow.

“An almost supreme divine weapon! Just one soul essence away!” Someone gasped, their eyes burning with desire as they gazed at Luo Tian’s Sun-Devouring Bow.

Chapter 1985: True Immortal Battlefield

“Shenglong Sect’s depth is astonishing; they’ve already used two superior divine weapons so quickly!” All eyes were drawn to Luo Tian’s Sun-Devouring Bow.

“Break!” The next moment, the golden arrow shot from the bow, its string’s vibration echoing in everyone’s ears. The world shifted colors.

The entire world seemed to consist of Luo Tian’s arrow and Chen Tianyuan’s Oblivion Strike.

“Crack!” Thunder clashed; the arrow met the blade, and in a thunderous explosion, the sky cracked. Countless lightning bolts erupted from the heavens, striking both sects’ disciples and killing many more.

The invisible waves spread outward, surpassing the limits of Heavenly Immortals. Even a True Immortal early stage would find it difficult to withstand.

The waves spread, turning the area within ten thousand zhang into ruins. More Guiyu Sect disciples fell.

“Clang!” The emerald blade fell from the sky, piercing into the crimson ground. Yet its fierce light had faded.

“Indeed unparalleled!” The Middle Heavens’ sect masters gazed at Luo Tian’s Sun-Devouring Bow, their eyes burning with desire. Such a divine weapon would even stir the hearts of them.

“Kill!” Luo Tian did not hesitate, his feet pressing into the ground as he raised the Rupture Sky Spear toward Chen Tianyuan.

“Protect the Dao Disciple!” Guiyu Sect disciples roared, leaping into the air to block Chen Tianyuan. They knew if he died, it would be a devastating blow for Guiyu Sect.

“Those who block me die!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, and he let the disciples’ martial arts strike him. Like a living weapon, he pushed through their attacks, leaving a path of blood behind.

“Pf!” The cold spear pierced Chen Tianyuan’s throat, his eyes filled with resentment and a strange sense of liberation. He collapsed.

“Sorry, we had no enmity, but if you don’t die, I will!” Luo Tian whispered to himself, sighing deeply. He gazed at the battling sects.

These people had no real enmity, yet they were forced to fight each other—either you die or I live.

“Someday, I will surpass the Nine Divine Mountains’ rules and become the one who sets them!” Luo Tian roared in his heart, feeling suffocated by living under others’ rules.

They forced them to fight for life and death, commanding their survival or demise.

“The Dao Disciple Chen Tianyuan is dead!” Upon his death, Guiyu Sect disciples lost their leader, morale plummeting.

“Young Master’s might!”

“Shenglong Sect will prevail!” Unlike Guiyu Sect disciples, Shenglong Sect’s morale soared. At this moment, Luo Tian solidified his position as Shenglong Sect’s Young Master.

“Ah…” Above, the True Immortal mid-stage opponent of Xuan Dan roared. This man was Chen Tianyuan’s grandfather, Guiyu Sect’s Grand Elder.

“Everyone, take pills and continue fighting!” Luo Tian bellowed, watching the bloodied Disciplinary Hall forces. They had dwindled to under thirty thousand.

“Hold on! Our ancestors have not fallen!” Guiyu Sect disciples roared, their voices wild.

“Only four Heavenly Immortal peaks left?” Luo Tian quickly located the speaker and raised his Sun-Devouring Bow.

He drew the bow, releasing four golden arrows that pierced through the sky toward the four Heavenly Immortal peaks.

“Damn it!” The four Heavenly Immortal peaks, seeing the golden arrows approaching, growled and tried to dodge. However, Zuo Qiu Ming and others had them trapped tightly.

“Pf… pf…” The four divine energy arrows exploded the four men, splattering Zuo Qiu Ming’s group with blood.

“Follow me! Kill!” Zuo Qiu Ming roared, his voice filled with excitement. Now that Guiyu Sect had no Heavenly Immortal peaks left, they had nothing to fear.

“Four arrows killing four Heavenly Immortal peaks—this Luo Tian is destined to be the most dazzling figure in this Heavenly Contest!”

“Something’s off. Though superior divine weapons are powerful, their consumption is also immense. How can he still be so vigorous?” Someone sensed something was wrong, watching Luo Tian continue fighting Guiyu Sect disciples.

“It’s the Ultimate Stage!”

“This kid is a Heavenly Immortal Ultimate Stage! Unexpectedly, even the thin divine energy of the Lower Heavens produced an Ultimate Stage!” The sect masters’ faces bore admiration, gazing at Luo Tian’s relentless assault.

“If he had been born in the Middle Heavens, he would surely have made a name there!” The masters spoke with certainty.

“Indeed, Luo Tian!” Some figures in the crowd had glowing eyes, gazing at Luo Tian.

One of them was tall and exuded a savage aura, standing there with excitement in his eyes.

“Unexpectedly, Luo Tian has reached the Lower Heavens!” Man Hun muttered to himself before spotting Nan Gong Yuching and others approaching him.

“Luo Tian, I lost to you in the Nine Realms, but now in the Heavenly Realm, and I arrived here at a higher starting point than you. This time, I will not lose to you!” On the other side, a golden-robed youth’s eyes flashed with intensity.

Jin Xiyang, one of the sons of the ancient kings defeated by Luo Tian in the Nine Realms’ quest for the Dao Mark. Though he failed to claim the Dao Mark, Luo Tian opened the path to the Heavenly Realm and ascended. Jin Xiyang followed into the Heavenly Realm, successfully entering it.

However, upon his arrival, he was forced to transform into his true form—three-headed golden crow—and faced relentless pursuit by many Middle Heavens’ masters. Eventually, he managed to join the Golden Sun Sect and reached True Immortal status in human form.

Though he had entered the Heavenly Realm, Jin Xiyang no longer harbored hatred for Luo Tian. After all, they were both from the Nine Realms; their enmity was only in the Nine Realms. Now, Jin Xiyang had no hostility toward Luo Tian but felt a sense of rivalry and determination to surpass him.

Jin Xiyang believed others who had once been Luo Tian’s enemies in the Heavenly Realm would feel the same. After all, Luo Tian had imposed immense pressure on them.

“Man Hun!” Nan Gong Yuching and Ren Hongzhe’s faces bore excitement as they approached Man Hun, equally thrilled. Strangers in a foreign land meeting old friends—though the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan) and humans had initially been enemies, they later reconciled first. Luo Tian’s relationship with Man Hun was also good.

“Unexpectedly, I met you here!” Man Hun laughed heartily, gazing at Nan Gong Yuching.

“Star River Mansion?” Man Hun grinned, recognizing the Star River Mansion attire on Nan Gong Yuching and others. He greeted them warmly.

“You’ve also done well, entering the War God Hall!” Nan Gong Yuching and others chatted, discussing as Man Hun shifted his gaze to the battlefield.

“He’s not doing well, yet he reached the Lower Heavens. But his strength is undeniable. You don’t need to help?” Man Hun looked at Luo Tian’s relentless combat.

“Do you need our help?” Nan Gong Yuching replied, also spotting Jin Xiyang in the crowd but not greeting him. Though they were not enemies, they weren’t yet friends.

“Also…” Man Hun shook his head lightly. As Nine Realms people, they understood war. He knew Luo Tian’s strength and that the ancient kings’ invasion of humans was nothing compared to this battlefield.

Cries of battle echoed as Guiyu Sect’s forces, now leaderless, collapsed like a mountain. The five halls cut them into pieces, and their annihilation was merely a matter of time.

The Disciplinary Hall disciples were bloodstained but carried a grim aura. War was the fastest way to hone one’s spirit, yet it was also the most brutal method.

“Boom!” As Luo Tian fought, a corpse fell from the sky and landed before him.

“Master Song!” Luo Tian instantly recognized the corpse’s form, his face slightly changing as he saw the old man spitting blood and his lifeless aura.

Master Song had once saved Luo Tian in Longyin City, insisting he join the Earth Gate. Luo Tian refused but later merged with three sects, and Master Song’s strength soared to True Immortal early stage, entering the Grand Council.

Luo Tian then gazed at the True Immortal battlefield above, suddenly realizing it was the key to the entire battle.

At this moment, Shenglong Sect’s forces were suppressed; Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu fought a True Immortal peak, their pressure immense. They had been repeatedly repelled and spat blood.

Xuan Dan and others surrounded a True Immortal late stage opponent, the one who had killed Master Song. The man’s face was cold as he turned to Xuan Dan and others, charging toward them. In his mind, Luo Tian was impressive but not worthy of his attention.
