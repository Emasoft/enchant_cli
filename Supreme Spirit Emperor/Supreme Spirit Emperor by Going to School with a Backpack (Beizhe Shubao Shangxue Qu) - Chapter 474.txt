“Son, let us make a bet. I shall stand here and allow you to strike me three times. If I move beyond three zhang, I shall concede defeat and cease troubling you forever! But if I do not move three zhang, then from now on, you must be my loyal dog—faithful and obedient!” Ruan Xingyu’s face bore a look of contempt, imagining the scene of such a reckless youth licking his shoes.

“Such an arrangement seems unwise, for if I truly injure you, your brother may hold me accountable!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze tinged with fear, as if recalling Ruan Xenghe’s formidable reputation.

“Hah! If you can injure me, then it is your prowess. My brother shall never trouble you!” Ruan Xingyu laughed heartily, his lips trembling uncontrollably.

“If I strike, then your words must hold true! All of you must bear witness—this was his own doing!” Luo Tian addressed the crowd.

“Hmph, a mere early Heaven Immortal dares to injure Senior Ruan Xinghe? Even I could not be harmed!” The onlookers sneered.

Yu Haonan and the disciples of He Feng turned crimson with anger. Though Yu Haonan knew Luo Tian was formidable and possessed exceptional talent, the rank difference remained insurmountable. He could not even harm Ruan Xingyu, let alone Luo Tian—this was an open humiliation for He Feng.

“Come on! Strike me!”

“Ah…” Ruan Xingyu, seeing Luo Tian hesitate, urged him again. But before his words ended, a piercing scream escaped his lips as he toppled sideways, his already massive lips swelling rapidly to obscure half his face. Blood spewed from his mouth.

“Pang…” Ruan Xingyu’s body soared over ten zhang before crashing onto the ground in a pitiful heap.

“This…” The crowd fell silent, their faces etched with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian standing there, a smile on his face.

“Truly… he has flown!” Yu Haonan and the He Feng disciples stammered, stunned that Ruan Xingyu had been felled by Luo Tian.

“Witnesses! This was his own doing! And there are still two strikes left!” Luo Tian smiled, approaching Ruan Xingyu before raising his leg and forcefully stomping down on the latter’s limb.

“Crack…” A sharp sound echoed as Ruan Xingyu howled in agony, his leg snapped.

At the moment Luo Tian shattered Ruan Xingyu’s leg, Yu Haonan’s lips twitched, his legs trembling involuntarily. The sensation of this Luo Tian mirrored the moment when Danluo Master had broken his own legs.

“One more strike!” Luo Tian raised his other leg, driving it down on Ruan Xingyu’s remaining limb.

“Ah…” Ruan Xingyu, just revived from unconsciousness, was jolted back into pain. His eyes, once vacant, now burned with ferocity.

“You…” Ruan Xingyu pointed at Luo Tian, speechless. From the moment Luo Tian’s palm had struck his face, he was doomed to be tormented by him.

Luo Tian had never feared any opponent, not even a mid-Heaven Immortal. Ruan Xingyu’s overconfidence had left him unprepared; the first strike had stunned him. Luo Tian, seizing the opportunity, had not hesitated to break both of Ruan Xingyu’s legs.

“This scene is eerily familiar!” Yu Haonan observed Luo Tian, his mind merging with the image of a past figure. Yet he shook his head.

“Who is this youth who has shattered Ruan Xingyu’s legs?” The crowd murmured in astonishment, stunned by the youth’s ruthless nature.

“He is Luo Tian!” A voice soon identified him—many had witnessed the clash between Zhu Fengtian and Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian! No wonder he dared confront Zhu Fengtian! Though previously crushed by Zhu Fengtian, now he has grown so strong—felling Ruan Xingyu with a single strike!” The crowd buzzed.

“Why, what have I done? You yourself ordered me to strike!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Ruan Xingyu.

“You all—why are you still staring? Carry me back! If I don’t get treatment, my legs will be ruined!” Ruan Xingyu’s fury was tempered by the fact that Luo Tian had exploited his lack of preparation.

“Fools rush in, and regret follows!” Ruan Xingyu mentally cursed, but now was not the time for vengeance.

“Boom…” Upon hearing Ruan Xingyu’s words, his companions erupted into chaos, lifting him and rushing toward He Feng.

“Luo… Luo Tian? The younger brother of the He Feng Sect’s chief?” The remaining one hundred and twenty disciples of He Feng wore expressions of disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration. Though some among them possessed higher cultivation than him, they now regarded him with reverence.

“I yield! I truly yield!” Yu Haonan grinned broadly, approaching Luo Tian, though his lips twitched.

“Take care of your wounds. When I return from the outer sect’s trial, I shall officially join He Feng!” Luo Tian patted Yu Haonan’s shoulder before handing him a pill.

Yu Haonan accepted the pill, his eyes flickering with confusion. He hesitated, then placed it in his mouth. His wounds healed visibly before their eyes.

“This pill!” Yu Haonan’s eyes widened, his gaze snapping to Luo Tian in shock.

“I must go. I hope you are all still at He Feng when I return!” Luo Tian shook his head at Yu Haonan, then addressed the crowd. Under Yu Haonan’s elated gaze, he descended from He Feng.

“Hah! Heaven has blessed He Feng!” As Luo Tian vanished, Yu Haonan burst into laughter. Though Luo Tian shook his head, it confirmed his suspicions—Yu Haonan was elated. With Luo Tian’s presence, He Feng would surely flourish.

“Senior Yu, do you know Luo Tian?” The crowd inquired, their expressions puzzled.

“I don’t. But having such a prodigy join He Feng is an affirmation of our sect’s strength. We shall surely thrive!” Yu Haonan spoke softly, his voice resolute despite its quietness.

Luo Tian walked back to his thatched hut at night, sitting on his bed and resting until the third watch. He slowly opened his eyes.

“This is no simple matter. Zhu Youde deliberately concealed the sect he was heading to—Luan Tian Sect. This journey may not be tranquil. I must prepare more strategies, just in case!” Luo Tian muttered, then rose and flew toward the Tianlong Tomb.

That night, the once-quiet Tianlong Tomb roared with ghostly howls, leaving outer sect disciples sleepless again.

Chapter 1834: A Death Trap

At dawn, sunlight bathed Luo Tian as he emerged from the Tianlong Tomb, his body damp with dew. He stood at the courtyard’s gate, awaiting Zhu Youde.

“Luo Senior Brother, you rose so early! What happened in the tomb yesterday?” Zhu Youde, his body plump and weary, appeared at Luo Tian’s courtyard. The night’s ghostly wails had clearly exhausted him.

“Nothing, Senior Zhu. Let us depart. I don’t wish to linger here a moment longer!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, grabbing Zhu Youde’s arm and dragging him toward the outer sect.

“You should stay a while longer,” Zhu Youde sighed internally. Once a prodigy, now reduced to this fate—this journey might cost him his life.

“Let’s go! Let’s go!” Luo Tian urged, eager to see what awaited him.

“Very well. If you insist, I shall not hinder you,” Zhu Youde shook his head and led Luo Tian out of the Tianlong Tomb.

At that moment, two figures stood at the outer sect’s plaza, surrounded by disciples who bowed respectfully.

A red-cloaked Zhu Fengtian and a youth with a scar across his face—its jagged path stretched from the youth’s forehead to his jaw, marred his once-pretty face into a grotesque visage.

“Ruan Xinghe, why have you suddenly emerged? I heard your brother was felled by that youth named Luo Tian yesterday!” Zhu Fengtian’s tone carried mockery as he addressed the scarred youth.

Ruan Xinghe, ranked second on Tianlong’s battle list, had never lost to any peer except for the top-ranked岑威宏. His scar was a mark of shame from his duel with岑威宏, vowing to erase it only upon defeating him.

“Zhu Fengtian, if you wish to fight, then fight!” Ruan Xinghe’s face was cold, his gaze icy. In the entire Tianlong Sect, only岑威宏 held his respect; others were trash, including Zhu Fengtian, ranked third.

“You…” Zhu Fengtian’s face darkened at Ruan Xinghe’s arrogance, but he said nothing.

“You are the new outer sect disciples needing trial?” Zhu Fengtian turned, addressing the ten individuals beside him.

Four males and five females, hailing from the outer sect’s male and female halls. Gu Qianxue and Long Youlan were among them.

“Yes, we hope your senior brothers will guide us kindly!” The four male disciples smiled sycophantically, addressing Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe. The other three females also gazed at them with flirtatious eyes, their expressions dreamy.

“You all listen carefully. From Tianlong Sect to Luan Tian Sect, obey strictly. If you lose your lives, don’t blame us for not saving you. And if your foolishness delays us, I shall not forgive you!” Zhu Fengtian’s gaze swept over the nine disciples. His eyes lingered on Long Youlan and Gu Qianxue, flickering with interest.

“Of course!” As Zhu Fengtian’s words ended, Zhu Youde arrived with Luo Tian.

“Two prodigies, rest assured our outer sect disciples will heed your orders. If anyone disobeys, inform me—I shall deal with them!” Zhu Youde smiled sycophantically at Zhu Fengtian.

“Ah, you’ve arrived!” Zhu Fengtian smiled, gazing at Luo Tian trailing behind Zhu Youde.

“Pushing Luo Tian into the fire!” The crowd murmured, pitying him as they looked at Luo Tian.

Who in the Tianlong Sect didn’t know that Luo Tian had clashed with Zhu Fengtian, nearly dying at his hands? And why Ruan Xinghe had suddenly joined the outer sect trial—though people heard that Ruan Xinghe’s brother was felled by Luo Tian, still recovering from the injury—no one believed Ruan Xinghe would voluntarily join the trial.

“Only the top-ranked岑威宏 remains on Tianlong’s list! The last time three of you appeared was during the sect competitions!” The crowd sighed, watching Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe.

“Son? Surprised? Delighted?” Zhu Fengtian’s gaze held mockery as he addressed Luo Tian.

“I wish to kill you, so you must die!” Zhu Fengtian stepped closer, whispering only they could hear.

“But I wish to strike you now!” Luo Tian replied in their hearing, his leg raised high and kicked Zhu Fengtian’s crotch.

“Ugh…” Zhu Fengtian crumpled, his face red, hands clutching himself. His body bent as if holding back a breath, the searing pain leaving him speechless, sweat drenching his face.

“Ah… ghosts!” Luo Tian screamed wildly, pounding Zhu Fengtian repeatedly.

“What’s happening…” The crowd was stunned, bewildered by Luo Tian’s sudden madness.

And he struck Zhu Fengtian’s vital spot, the crowd’s mouths twitching as they watched blood seep from Zhu Fengtian’s crotch, pitying him.

“Luo Senior Brother… Luo Tian! Stop!” Zhu Youde shouted, his heart jolting. Yet he rushed to stop Luo Tian.

“Not simple!” Ruan Xinghe gazed at the mad Luo Tian, murmuring. His strike had been precise and ruthless—even Ruan Xinghe struggled to evade. Zhu Fengtian, distracted by Luo Tian’s attack, had suffered a hidden blow.

“Ah… ghosts!” Though Zhu Youde stopped him, Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with black mist. He wildly punched Zhu Youde, each strike causing him excruciating pain.

“Luo Tian Brother, has he gone mad?” Long Youlan’s face bore worry as she watched the frenzied Luo Tian, her eyes moist.

“He is faking it!” Gu Qianxue’s face was cold, yet she marveled at Luo Tian’s strength. Though she knew he was strong, she hadn’t expected Zhu Fengtian to suffer a hidden blow.

“Unseemly!” As Luo Tian raged and Zhu Youde failed to stop him, a cold voice echoed from the sky. A senior stood there, scolding them.

“Respect Master Duan!” The crowd bowed to the elder in the sky, their faces respectful.

Master Duan Chengfeng of He Feng Sect—this elder was the one who had clashed with Zuo Qiuming on Tianlong’s battle platform.

Luo Tian’s heart tensed—this was to end him completely, first Zhu Fengtian, then Ruan Xinghe, and now Duan Chengfeng.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s eyes’ black mist faded, his body returning to normal as he gazed around innocently.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Tian looked at his hands, then surveyed the crowd.

“Fool!” Zhu Fengtian gritted his teeth, glaring at Luo Tian. He knew Luo Tian was faking madness; the pain he felt was humiliating.

“Damn… he doesn’t even know what he did!” The crowd stared in disbelief at Luo Tian’s bewildered face.

“You were rude to Senior Zhu! I must reprimand you!” Zhu Youde scolded loudly, rubbing his bruises. His gaze was furious at Luo Tian.

“Ah… I’m sorry, Senior Zhu! I didn’t mean to! I’ve been guarding the Tianlong Tomb for a while, and I think it’s haunted. Sometimes my mind isn’t right!” Luo Tian apologized, gazing at Zhu Fengtian’s face, now crimson.

“Cough… cough…” Zhu Fengtian’s eyes burned with fury, his mouth spitting blood.

“It’s no problem! Luo Senior Brother was unintentional. I noticed his condition was off, so I let him attack without retaliation!” Zhu Fengtian forced a smile, addressing Luo Tian. He couldn’t afford to lose face in front of everyone—how could a third-ranked prodigy be defeated by a mad Luo Tian?

“Senior Zhu is truly magnanimous!”

“I see, Senior Zhu let him off. Truly a benevolent elder of Tianlong! Previously, Luo Tian clashed with you, but now he’s so magnanimous and didn’t retaliate. His crotch must be torn apart, yet he held back!” The crowd gazed at Zhu Fengtian with reverence.

Zhu Fengtian’s lips twitched as he listened to the murmurs, yet his face wore a seemingly gentle smile.

“Hmph! An outer sect disciple assaulting an inner sect one—insubordination. I think your trial is unnecessary; send him to Soul-Ending Mountain for a year of isolation!” Duan Chengfeng sneered, gazing at Luo Tian. He remembered Zuo Qiuming’s humiliation and sought to vent his anger on Luo Tian, who was Zuo Qiuming’s sworn brother.

“Soul-Ending Mountain!” The crowd’s faces changed, shivering at the name.

Soul-Ending Mountain—its name was apt; those who entered never returned. It was the punishment for the most heinous disciples, leaving them to rot without hope.

“But they are not in cahoots!” Luo Tian’s heart skipped a beat, realizing Duan Chengfeng, Zhu Fengtian, and Ruan Xinghe were not allies.

Chapter 1835: Departure

No one expected Duan Chengfeng to target Luo Tian so swiftly. The crowd sensed the trial was suspicious—this was clearly a setup to kill Luo Tian.

Duan Chengfeng, a late Heaven Immortal nearing peak status; Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe were both mid-Heaven Immortals, their strength formidable. Even a late Heaven Immortal might struggle to defeat them.

With three leaders, all hostile toward Luo Tian, his path was sealed.

“Did the sect wish to abandon such a prodigy? Would the master approve?” The crowd sighed, recalling Luo Tian’s initial enrollment—three sect elders vied for him, even the revered Xuan Dan praised him.

Yet now they had pushed him into a death trap, with Duan Chengfeng, Zhu Fengtian, and Ruan Xinghe all capable of killing him.

“Blame his arrogance! He offended Master Xuan Dan too harshly, and failed to restrain himself. This is his own doing!” The crowd sighed, feeling Luo Tian had been overly arrogant recently.

“Self-inflicted misfortune!” Some felt sorrow, others indifference, and some mockery as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Master Duan, what right do you have to punish a disciple with Soul-Ending Mountain?” As the crowd mused, Zuo Qiuming appeared.

“Zuo Qiuming, must you always oppose me?” Duan Chengfeng’s face darkened.

“It is not I who opposes you, but you who oppose me!” Zuo Qiuming shook his head, his gaze scornful. Though he was fewer in number now, his strength remained—enough to suppress Duan Chengfeng.

“Little brother, I say you should enter the inner sect directly. No need to risk it outside. Join us He Feng and enjoy peace!” Zuo Qiuming ignored Duan Chengfeng’s words, smiling as he approached Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Upon hearing Zuo Qiuming’s words, Duan Chengfeng, Zhu Fengtian, and Ruan Xinghe’s faces shifted slightly. They had all aimed to eliminate Luo Tian secretly, but if he joined the inner sect, their efforts would be wasted.

“Senior Brother, I am not that kind of person! I don’t wish for people to say I became inner sect because of you!”

“Just a trial. No danger. And with Senior Zhu and Ruan by your side, how could you be in peril?” Luo Tian smiled confidently.

Zuo Qiuming’s intent was clear—seeing Duan Chengfeng, Zhu Fengtian, and Ruan Xinghe all hostile, he wished Luo Tian to avoid risk.

Yet Duan Chengfeng’s trio sought to kill Luo Tian, and Luo Tian too wished to eliminate them.

“Is this Luo Tian a fool?” Others gazed at him with pity, thinking Zuo Qiuming had helped him so much yet he still failed to grasp it.

“Hah! Luo Senior Brother is truly a dragon among men! Rest assured, I shall protect you throughout the journey!” Zhu Fengtian laughed heartily, clutching his crotch as he approached Luo Tian.

“Yes! Luo Senior Brother, rest assured—no one can harm you with me here!” Ruan Xinghe, who had spoken little, smiled gently at Luo Tian.

“Then thank you both! I may go mad again—please assist me then!” Luo Tian smiled, his eyes also gleaming.

“Alright, are you all ready? Let’s depart!” Duan Chengfeng smiled warmly, gazing at Luo Tian, fearing he might change his mind.

Luo Tian smiled, approaching Long Youlan and gently patting her head. Though they hadn’t seen each other for a while, he had sent many pills to her. Now she had reached early Heaven Immortal.

“Luo Tian Brother!” Long Youlan was excited yet worried, recalling Luo Tian’s madness.

“Little girl, you’ve improved! Early Heaven Immortal!” Luo Tian smiled, exchanging a glance with Gu Qianxue. They nodded but said nothing more.

Ten outer sect disciples—five males and five females—were the best of their recruitment.

The other four male disciples wore sneers, already envisioning Luo Tian’s tragic end.

As for the other three females besides Gu Qianxue and Long Youlan, they gazed at Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe with reverence. If one of them could have something with them, they would elevate their status in Tianlong Sect.

As for Luo Tian, the three girls barely noticed him—when he first joined, if he had shown interest, they would have thrown themselves at him. Now, he was just a corpse.

“Roar…” As Duan Chengfeng’s words ended, a deep roar echoed from the sky. A dragon soared upward, obscuring the heavens and appearing before them.

“Let’s go!” Duan Chengfeng leapt into the air, stepping onto the dragon’s massive head.

“This journey is long—about a month. Thus, the sect has provided a dragon of early Heaven Immortal level for our convenience!” Duan Chengfeng smiled, the early Heaven Immortal dragon being quite good.

Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe also leapt into the air, standing behind Duan Chengfeng.

The other disciples rose and stood on the dragon’s back.

“Brother, be careful!” Zuo Qiuming frowned, seeing Luo Tian insisted on going. He gave him a final warning before falling silent.

“Rest assured, Senior Brother! When I return, I’ll help you revive He Feng!” Luo Tian smiled, pulling Long Youlan toward the dragon’s back.

“Pang…” Luo Tian and Long Youlan landed securely on the dragon’s back, joining the other disciples.

“Let’s go!” Duan Chengfeng roared, patting the dragon’s back. The massive creature soared into the sky, departing Tianlong Sect.

“Such a waste of talent!” The Tianlong Sect disciples watched the dragon vanish, sighing in sorrow.

……

Blue skies and white clouds—vast dragon soared through the clouds toward Luan Tian Sect. The atmosphere on the dragon’s back was strange.

Gu Qianxue, clad in black, sat calmly, her aura repelling others. Even Duan Chengfeng spoke two sentences to her, but she coldly replied. Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe received no attention from her.

On the other hand, four male disciples and three female disciples surrounded Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe, constantly flattering them. The three females circled Zhu Fengtian, nearly ready to strip for him. Ruan Xinghe sat cross-legged, occasionally opening his eyes and casting a killing gaze at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian Brother, look! That’s the Dragon City ahead—we’re approaching Long Yin City!” Long Youlan chattered to Luo Tian.

“Hm! You want to visit home?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the scenery below from the dragon’s back.

“Hmph! This is a sect mission, not for visiting family!” A red-cloaked female disciple leaned against Zhu Fengtian’s body, allowing his hand to roam over her. Her face was seductive as she scolded Long Youlan.

“Indeed! Do you think we all obey your orders?” Another two females and several male disciples also scolded.

After ten days of flight, the dragon’s speed was swift—only ten days to reach Long Yin City. Crossing the vast End-of-the-World Forest would bring them to Long Yin City, and north of it lay Luan Tian Sect.

Throughout the journey, every time Luo Tian and Long Youlan spoke, they drew mockery from other disciples.

“I never said I wanted to return!” Long Youlan pouted at them, but her eyes flickered with longing. It was her first time leaving home; she missed it.

“Let’s visit Long Yin City when we return!” Luo Tian smiled, thinking that upon returning, none of them except himself would survive.

“Luo Tian, who do you think you are? Returning home after the trial! Why should we obey you?” The disciples mocked again.

“Seductress!” Long Youlan muttered, calling the three females names.

“You said what? Little girl, I’ve been fed up with you! I never liked you since the outer sect!” Long Youlan’s words were soft, but the three females heard. One stood up, adjusting her clothes and approaching Long Youlan with a hand raised to slap her.

“Talking about you!” Luo Tian couldn’t stand it and struck the girl’s face with his hand.

“Smack!” A crisp sound echoed on the dragon’s back, and the girl was thrown backward. Her hair was disheveled, colliding with Zhu Fengtian’s chest as he stood up.

“Enough!” Zhu Fengtian gazed at the dragon soaring over the End-of-the-World Forest.

At the same time, Ruan Xinghe and Duan Chengfeng’s faces bore coldness as they rose, their auras gradually rising.

Chapter 1836: End-of-the-World Crisis

“Boy, how about this place as your tomb?” Zhu Fengtian spoke coldly, gazing at Luo Tian. This was his original plan—to find a spot to kill Luo Tian and leave no trace.

“Finally, you’ve had enough?” Luo Tian smiled, unsure of other places but confident in this one: the End-of-the-World Forest.

“It’s a good place, but not mine—it’s yours!” Luo Tian pulled Long Youlan behind him, gazing at Duan Chengfeng and the two others.

“Hah! A great joke, boy! Don’t you dare to die now—now is the time for your last words. Though you have some strength, against Senior Zhu and Ruan’s absolute power, you are doomed!” The other disciples sneered at Luo Tian.

“Show your cards! Otherwise, you have no chance!”

“Unfortunately, your brother’s talent is good, but he shouldn’t have attacked my brother. Breaking his legs requires a life!” Ruan Xinghe spoke softly.

“Admit it, your brothers are all the same—trash!” Luo Tian shook his head before crouching and patting the dragon’s back.

“You’re stubborn!” Zhu Fengtian’s aura surged, his red sword in hand.

“Curious, what gave you the courage to come with us?” Zhu Fengtian gazed at Luo Tian.

Others also focused on Luo Tian, puzzled—everyone knew this was a death trap. Luo Tian wasn’t a fool, yet he had come like one.

“My own courage!” Luo Tian held his spear, his aura rising as he met Zhu Fengtian’s gaze.

“Admit it, your progress is impressive, but you’re still not enough for me. If this is your strength, then you may die!” Zhu Fengtian raised his sword and stepped toward Luo Tian.

“Then let’s see who kills whom!” Luo Tian stood on the dragon’s back, letting out a thunderous roar.

The roar caused the dragon to tremble and flip over, breaking Duan Chengfeng’s control.

In an instant, everyone except Luo Tian and Long Youlan was stunned—this dragon had always been steady.

“Hum…” As the crowd staggered, Luo Tian seized the opportunity. He waved his hand, and Xiao Yue’s Wolf King and three dogs emerged, roaring toward Zhu Fengtian. Luo Tian also charged at Zhu Fengtian with his spear.

“Damn!” Zhu Fengtian staggered but recovered quickly, though it was too late. Two lightning bolts—black and green—appeared before him, their fierce aura engulfing his senses.

“Get out!” Zhu Fengtian roared, his body ablaze with fire. His red sword slashed forward.

The sword’s aura crackled, striking Xiao Yue’s Wolf King. Blood spewed as the wolf cried out and was thrown back.

Compared to Xiao Yue’s Wolf King, the three dogs were bolder. Zhu Fengtian’s second sword struck them, sparks flying from their black bodies as they charged at him. One head lunged toward Zhu Fengtian.

“Go!” Zhu Fengtian growled, forming a hand seal and pushing his red palm forward. It struck the three dogs’ bodies.

But none were as deadly as the golden spear that appeared behind Zhu Fengtian, its aura tearing through his back.

“Ah…” Zhu Fengtian wasn’t ordinary; sensing the life-threatening danger, he dodged the vital spot but was pierced through the shoulder.

“Puff…” The spear withdrew, taking Zhu Fengtian’s flesh with it. Luo Tian joined the three dogs and Xiao Yue’s Wolf King, while Long Youlan stood behind him.

“These two beasts are powerful!” Duan Chengfeng and Ruan Xinghe stood in the sky, gazing at Luo Tian.

“But if this is your secret weapon, then you may choose to die!” Ruan Xinghe’s body shimmered with starlight, his aura resonating with the sound of rivers. His green sword appeared in his hand.

The attack by Luo Tian, the three dogs, and Xiao Yue’s Wolf King had been instantaneous. Even Duan Chengfeng and Ruan Xinghe hadn’t reacted in time, but by the time they did, Luo Tian’s attack was already complete.

“A perfect ambush! If it were a mid-Heaven Immortal, he might have succeeded!” Ruan Xinghe’s gaze was wary.

“Boy, you’ve injured me!” Zhu Fengtian’s face twisted with rage, his aura surging. Flames roared around him.

Duan Chengfeng also gathered his attack, pressure building in his hands.

“Unfortunately, the time hasn’t come yet!” Luo Tian gazed at the sun setting but night still hadn’t arrived.

“Let’s enter the End-of-the-World Forest first!” Luo Tian sneered, then vanished toward the forest. He knew he needed time and that the End-of-the-World Forest was his best chance to gain it.

“Trying to escape!” Duan Chengfeng and the others frowned, launching three powerful attacks toward Luo Tian.

Flame swords cut through the sky with red light, leaving a scorching trail. Green sword slashes like meteors struck Luo Tian. The most terrifying was the golden hand, its aura shaking the heavens and pressing down like a mountain.

“Little Black, block one! The rest are mine!” Luo Tian ordered the three dogs while golden light enveloped him. He extended his hands, invisible waves from his palms entwining the red and green sword slashes—eight directions of treasure retrieval.

“Roar!” The three dogs howled, their heads spitting out black lightning, purple poison gas, and icy coldness. They merged into a three-colored dragon, its aura destroying the heavens as it charged toward Duan Chengfeng’s golden hand.

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, his spiritual sense spreading outward. He pressed his hands together, and as he did so, the sword slashes from Zhu Fengtian and Ruan Xinghe collided.

“Burst…” A thunderous explosion echoed in the sky, two sword slashes colliding and Duan Chengfeng’s golden hand clashing with the three-colored dragon.
