“Originally, how long have we known each other? This is my elder brother. I dare not entrust him to someone I’ve only met for two days!” Chen Zhanbiao, a man of straightforward character, responded loudly.

As for other matters, Chen Zhanbiao was usually careless. But regarding Luo Tian’s safety, he could not afford to be lax. From the moment they had left, Chen Zhanbiao had resolved to stay by Luo Tian’s side. Nangong Yuching and others had also instructed Chen Zhanbiao.

The three quickly began arguing, their voices so loud that Luo Tian felt a headache. Eventually, it escalated to the point of physical confrontation.

“Enough! Are you trying to kill me?” Luo Tian, seeing the three men rolling up their sleeves and preparing to fight, quickly transmitted his voice to them.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Chen Zhanbiao and Da Niu Er Niu stopped. The three men glared at each other, their faces flushed with anger.

“Zhanbiao, go. I will stay at Fu Xingxuan’s for a while,” Luo Tian said, his gaze fixed on Chen Zhanbiao. He was confident in his own safety.

Upon hearing the name Fu Xingxuan, Chen Zhanbiao nodded in relief. Fu Xingxuan was still quite trustworthy.

“Go now! Da Niu Er Niu, you two go too!” Luo Tian was somewhat concerned about Chen Zhanbiao and had ordered Da Niu Er Niu to accompany him as well.

“Alright!” Seeing Luo Tian’s stern gaze, Da Niu Er Niu said nothing.

After entrusting the three men, Luo Tian headed toward the Siji Pavilion. Passing through it, he arrived at Fu Xingxuan’s domain of reincarnation and sat with Fu Xingxuan on the long bridge, beginning his recovery.

Time passed. Seven days later, Chen Zhanbiao and Da Niu Er Niu returned to Tianyuan Sect, delivering Luo Tian’s jade slip back to Jiang Sxi.

After examining the jade slip, Jiang Sxi summoned Nangong Yuching and others, allowing them to view the slip.

“Too arrogant!”
“Sending us to exterminate Luoshengmen? What’s the difference from having us defend against them?” After reading the slip, a chorus of curses erupted in the hall. The faces of all present bore expressions of anger.

“Enough, Diao Dezhu, Xiao Jie, Ren Hongzhe, and Xiang Qianbei. Please go to Hell for a visit. This is the two years Luo Tian secured. We must cherish it and not remain idle,” Jiang Sxi cleared her throat and addressed the group.

“Yes!” Long Jie and the four others stood up. Along with Chen Zhanbiao’s three men, seven individuals in total. Their strength was formidable. Diao Dezhu excelled at searching for people and items.

Xiang Tianming was also in the late stage of Immortal King, currently the strongest within Tianyuan Sect. Huo Zhu Meng Wushuang was also striving for the late stage of Immortal King and could not leave.

“Remember, life is most important. Wherever you go, follow Xiang Qianbei and Luo Tian’s instructions!” Jiang Sxi addressed the group.

“Leave it to us!” Xiang Tianming smiled slightly and, with Long Jie and the others, flew out of Tianyuan Sect.

“At least we have a temporary foothold. Hell won’t attack us either. However, we must not be complacent. Two years is too short! Moreover, Hell’s forces filling the First Heaven may advance earlier,” Jiang Sxi spoke softly.

Another seven days passed. Xiang Tianming and the seven men finally arrived at the Reincarnation Hall, while Luo Tian’s injuries had recovered to seventy percent. There was no major issue.

In the courtyard, Luo Tian observed the arrivals and felt excitement. Fu Xingxuan also emerged.

“Haha, Sister Xingxuan, it’s been a while! Still as beautiful as ever!” Diao Dezhu saw Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan, then laughed heartily.

“Get lost, trying to take advantage of me!” Luo Tian kicked Diao Dezhu, causing a look of委屈 (disappointment) in Diao Dezhu’s eyes.

“This is also something you could notice…” Diao Dezhu muttered, but he had already grown accustomed to being kicked and didn’t take it too seriously.

“Kid, tell us your plan!” Xiang Tianming spoke immediately upon arrival.

“My plan is to stall. Two years, we can’t possibly exterminate Luoshengmen!”

“I called you here mainly to find people. Find Qiu Chan and bring her back!” Luo Tian addressed the group.

He had never intended to exterminate Luoshengmen. It was merely a performance for the Ten Palaces’ Lords. Therefore, Luo Tian hadn’t planned to move Tianyuan Sect into Hell and had kept it at Tianlan Sect all along.

“Hmph, you know Hell better. We’ll follow your lead,” Xiang Tianming nodded.

“I have a card in my hand that can locate one of Luoshengmen’s strongholds. Once I recover, we’ll check it out!” Luo Tian spoke softly, thinking of the Demon Lord.

Chapter 2625: Re-entering Zhou Gui Wang City

That day, Diao Dezhu, Long Jie, and Ren Hongzhe left the Reincarnation Hall. Xiang Tianming, however, delved into the records of Hell within the Reincarnation Hall. After all, they had just arrived in Hell and needed to understand it first.

As Hell launched a major attack on the Immortal realm, Hell was no longer so mysterious to the Immortals. Many forces that had been suppressed by Hell and chosen to ally with it gradually integrated into Hell. Therefore, Diao Dezhu’s group was not shunned by Hell.

Luo Tian focused on recovering his injuries, waiting for news from Diao Dezhu’s group.

One day... two days...

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian's injuries gradually recovered. After fifteen days, his wounds were finally healed.

In Luo Tian’s courtyard, a large pot was set up. A group of people gathered around it—Chen Zhanbiao, Da Niu Er Niu, and several Immortal Kings from the Reincarnation Hall.

During this time, these strong individuals often came to visit for meals, becoming close friends with Chen Zhanbiao and engaging in lively interactions.

“Zhanbiao, it’s time to work!” Luo Tian addressed Chen Zhanbiao and Da Niu Er Niu, who were still in the courtyard cooking hotpot.

“Ah!” Chen Zhanbiao and the two others brightened their eyes, revealing a glimmer of excitement.

“Sect Prince, we can’t help you anymore!”

“But the Sect Master said that if the Sect Prince encounters a life-threatening crisis, we can contact him. The Reincarnation Hall will surely spare no effort to protect the Sect Prince!” Yu Tian spoke, his gaze filled with admiration. This was a decision made by other sects to weaken Tianyuan Sect.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded. He hadn’t expected the Reincarnation Hall to assist him. The White and Black Death had already helped him enough. If it weren’t for the White and Black Death, even with Wang Duantian’s presence, other sects would have intervened. Luo Tian led Chen Zhanbiao out of the Reincarnation Hall. As for Da Niu Er Niu, Luo Tian didn’t take them along. After all, Da Niu Er Niu were still part of the Reincarnation Hall. Luo Tian hadn’t intended for them to join Tianyuan Sect. Since he had left the Reincarnation Hall, it was necessary to leave a Sect Prince for them. Da Niu Er Niu were the best choice. Their strength was no less than Ye Qiu’s.

Xiang Tianming also stepped out. The three stood at the entrance of the Reincarnation Hall. Luo Tian gazed at the hall’s gate, bowing deeply to it.

A sound of breaking through the air echoed. Three figures appeared outside the Reincarnation Hall—Diao Dezhu and Long Jie.

“Did you find anything?” Luo Tian asked, gazing at Diao Dezhu and the others.

“They’re strong. We’ve been familiarizing ourselves with Hell while investigating Luoshengmen. This Luoshengmen is deeply hidden, seemingly infiltrating everywhere,” Diao Dezhu spoke.

“We found a small stronghold of Luoshengmen. However, when we arrived, there were only ten or so True Immortals at their peak,” Diao Dezhu continued.

“Just as I destroyed that stronghold, a True Immortal emerged. We intentionally let him escape. His scent I’ve memorized; I can find him again,” Diao Dezhu added.

“Good, then let’s start with that one!” Luo Tian nodded. Diao Dezhu hadn’t even found any substantial information, indicating how deeply hidden Luoshengmen was.

“What’s the background of this Luoshengmen? Why do so many strong individuals willingly join it?” Long Jie asked.

“Why did Yang Huanyu sacrifice the Tianyuan Continent? I know Yang Huanyu is in Luoshengmen and has been reborn. Yang Huanyu values life more now, and his yearning for immortality is even stronger,” Luo Tian sighed.

Yang Huanyu had always been a terrifying enemy. According to Luo Tian’s knowledge, Jing Wu Ye, an ancient strong individual, was also in Luoshengmen. Luo Tian didn’t know how many other strong individuals were within Luoshengmen. Unknown enemies were the most terrifying.

Six people flew through the sky, Diao Dezhu constantly sniffing the air. They flew toward the direction of the True Immortal that Diao Dezhu and the others had let escape.

After three days, the six people stopped at a large city’s outskirts. Luo Tian was slightly surprised, gazing at the four big characters on the gate—Zhou Gui Wang City!

“This person is in this city, but it seems something is concealing his aura!” Diao Dezhu spoke to Luo Tian.

“This is going to be a tough one,” Luo Tian sighed, his eyes revealing regret. He had come to Hell but hadn’t visited Su Dan yet. Thinking of Su Dan’s personality, he might endure countless hardships.

“Let’s go. This is my father-in-law’s city!” Luo Tian strode into Zhou Gui Wang City and directly headed for the Zhou Gui Wang Mansion.

“Excuse me, I am Luo Tian. Please inform him that I wish to see the Zhou Gui King,” Luo Tian did not dare to barge in directly, addressing the two guards.

“Luo Tian, your son-in-law!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the two guards’ faces slightly changed. Who didn’t know Luo Tian’s name?

“Luo Tian!” As the two guards exclaimed, a thunderous voice echoed from within the city lord’s mansion.

Luo Tian knew who it was. Therefore, when Luo Tian entered Zhou Gui Wang City, the old Zhou Gui King had already received news of his arrival.

The voice faded. A figure with overwhelming power stepped out from the courtyard—white-haired, eyes deep and solemn, followed by Zhou Gui Wang City’s strong individuals. It was the old Zhou Gui King, Su Peng.

“Hmph?” Upon seeing Su Peng, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. The current Su Peng was somewhat different from the past. Although his power remained, he seemed aged, with many white hairs and an unfriendly gaze toward Luo Tian.

However, Luo Tian dared not retaliate. After all, this was his father-in-law. He had left abruptly years ago without giving Su Dan an explanation. It was natural for Su Peng to be angry.

“Father-in-law, it’s all my fault!” Luo Tian smiled apologetically and approached Su Peng, bowing respectfully.

“Huh…” However, the response was a slap from Su Peng directly aimed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, seeing Su Peng’s furious slap, was momentarily stunned but dared not resist. He was slapped hard by Su Peng.

With a “slap,” Luo Tian’s body flew back more than ten zhang before stopping. He gazed at Su Peng, surprised that his father-in-law had struck so harshly.

“Get out!” Su Peng shouted loudly, his eyes still filled with anger. He took a step forward to continue beating Luo Tian.

Diao Dezhu and the others’ faces slightly changed. This was their first time seeing Luo Tian beaten without retaliation—even Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian hadn’t beaten Luo Tian like this.

“Old man, who are you beating?” Chen Zhanbiao couldn’t take it anymore and blocked Su Peng, punching him with a fist.

Tenfold flesh strength suddenly erupted. Chen Zhanbiao’s massive fist radiated terrifying divine power, causing Su Peng to stop his movement. However, he still delivered a palm strike.

“Zhanbiao, stop!” Luo Tian shouted loudly. A wave of energy rose beneath his feet, and he instantly appeared between Chen Zhanbiao and Su Peng. He extended both hands—one grasping Chen Zhanbiao’s fist, the other blocking Su Peng’s palm.

Chapter 2626: Son

Boom... Boom...

Two resounding impacts. Luo Tian stood between Chen Zhanbiao and Su Peng, blocking their attacks. His face turned red, blood trickled from his lips.

Chen Zhanbiao’s tenfold flesh strength and Su Peng’s desperate strike were not easy to withstand. Luo Tian felt as if his bones had shattered, in excruciating pain.

Chen Zhanbiao’s face changed slightly. He quickly stopped and supported Luo Tian, his gaze more angry toward Su Peng.

Su Peng also halted. However, he still panted heavily, clearly still angry.

“Father-in-law, what’s going on?” Luo Tian was puzzled. Even if Su Peng had resentment, it wasn’t this angry. It was too harsh—this would kill him.

“Su Dan is nearly dead!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Su Peng’s expression turned desolate. His gaze remained angry toward Luo Tian.

“What!” Upon hearing Su Peng’s words, Luo Tian’s face changed drastically. His eyes filled with disbelief.

Who was Su Dan? Now one of Hell’s Eight Heavenly Kings. If something were to happen, it would have spread throughout Hell already. Why was there no news?

“Take me to see her!” Luo Tian spoke without hesitation, stepping into the city lord’s mansion.

This time, Su Peng did not block Luo Tian. Instead, he led Luo Tian to a quiet courtyard.

Outside the courtyard stood many attendants anxiously. A young man, around thirteen or fourteen years old, stood at the gate with a long sword on his back. His face was dark.

Though young, his aura was astonishing. On his forehead was a white mark resembling a feather.

The youth was extraordinarily handsome. Though thirteen or fourteen, it was clear he would become an attractive man in the future.

“Luo’er! Why are you here?” Su Peng saw the youth and shouted, while the youth also noticed Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu’s group.

Luo Tian locked eyes with the youth. His body trembled slightly, his gaze revealing regret. Seeing the youth’s appearance, he recognized him immediately—this was the youth.

“Grandfather, who are they? Are they here to heal my mother?” The youth asked, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“This is your father!” Su Peng sighed and spoke to the youth.

“This is your son with Su Dan, named Luo Su!” Su Peng also introduced Luo Tian to the youth, causing Luo Tian to苦笑 (a bitter smile).

“Child…” Luo Tian took a step forward and approached the youth, unsure of what to say.

“Get lost…” Luo Su trembled, gazing at Luo Tian. He had no memory of Luo Tian.

Since childhood, he had been raised by Su Peng. From the time he could remember, Luo Su had only heard of Luo Tian. Moreover, people in Zhou Gui Wang City often spoke about Luo Tian, and it was certainly not good words. Therefore, Luo Su had no good impression of Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt bitter. He truly was wrong, feeling he had neglected his wife and child too much. His past with Luo Li was also the case—only Luo Xiting had been by his side for a short time.

As for Luo Su, it was even more neglected. He had only met him briefly before rushing to attack Hell.

Su Peng coldly snorted and did not speak for Luo Tian. He loved his grandson to the core.

Luo Su had indeed not disappointed Su Peng. At thirteen, he was already at the late stage of Heavenly Immortal and had cultivated a fox tail.

“I know it’s difficult for you to forgive me, but I am still your father!” Luo Tian spoke softly, knowing that Luo Su definitely hated him.

“Let me first see your mother!” Luo Tian spoke softly. The matter of Luo Su could be set aside for now, but Su Dan’s situation was urgent.

“No, your mother said you shouldn’t see her!” Luo Su blocked Luo Tian’s path with his hand.

“Kid, he is your father. How can you treat him like this!” Diao Dezhu couldn’t take it anymore and pushed Luo Su away.

Luo Tian didn’t care. He directly opened the door and entered Su Dan’s room.

Upon entering, a pungent medicinal scent filled Luo Tian’s nose. He furrowed his brows slightly.

On the bed, weak breathing sounds echoed. Each breath seemed to drain immense strength.

Luo Tian listened to the breathing, as if a giant hammer struck his heart. He felt unbearable pain.

“Is it Luo’er?” A weak voice echoed from the bed, accompanied by coughs. This made Luo Tian’s heart sink further.

“It is!” Luo Tian responded and took a step toward the bed.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s voice, the person on the bed fell silent. Then came heavy breathing and violent coughs.

“Leave!” The voice from the bed said, only those two words before it stopped.

“Su Dan!” Luo Tian didn’t listen. He stepped to the bed and saw Su Dan’s condition. Upon seeing it, his heart ached even more.

Su Dan had once been radiant and alluring. But the person on the bed was unrecognizable as the former Su Dan.

The person on the bed had a thin body like a skeleton. Her original long black hair was gone, replaced by white. Her red lips were pale. Her face had deep wrinkles. Her physical functions seemed lost, and she could only lie there.

Luo Tian’s eyes became moist. Seeing his wife in such a state, he could imagine the pain Su Dan had endured during this time. And yet, he wasn’t there.

“I deserve to die!” Luo Tian said those three words. Su Peng had almost beaten him to death, and now he had no resentment.

Luo Tian reached out to touch her face but was stopped by Su Peng.

“I told you to leave…” Su Dan seemed to have a moment of clarity and shouted, her voice filled with anger. A woman in such a state could not bear to be seen by the one she loved most.

“I’m not leaving!” Luo Tian replied firmly. He extended a finger, and blood flowed from it, dripping into Su Dan’s lips. No matter how much she shouted, she couldn’t move—only allowing the blood to fall into her mouth.

“Useless. I’ve sent many precious medicines, but it still didn’t help. She can only hang on,” Zhou Gui King spoke, his eyes filled with sorrow.

Wu...

But just as Su Peng’s words finished, waves of energy rose from Su Dan. Her complexion gradually improved.

“What’s happening?” Su Peng’s face changed. He had also tried his own blood to heal Su Dan, but it was ineffective.

Chapter 2627: Prohibited Techniques

Blood continued to drip, falling into Su Dan’s mouth. As Luo Tian’s blood dripped, Su Dan’s complexion gradually turned rosy.

Su Peng’s eyes widened in disbelief. He had also tried his own blood to heal Su Dan, and their Zhou Gui King lineage was very strong. However, it had little effect.

Even Su Peng had taken some of Luo Su’s blood. After all, Luo Su had a ancestral mark, and his lineage was closer to the Zhou Gui King’s ancestors.

But even so, it had little effect. Su Peng never imagined that Luo Tian’s blood would be so effective.

“Luo’er’s blood is nearly ancestral blood. Could this kid’s lineage surpass the ancestors?” Su Peng was stunned.

“Hence, Baihu and Heiyan protected this kid so much. It must be more complicated!” Su Peng seemed to have understood something, his mind clearing.

One... ten...

Luo Tian dripped a hundred drops of blood. He finally stopped, not because he didn’t want to give his essence blood to Su Dan but because she was too weak. She couldn’t accept nourishment, and his blood could only prolong her life but not resolve the issue.

“Need to think of a way!” Luo Tian muttered, watching Su Dan’s complexion gradually improve. Her face was rosy, and even her white hair had some black strands, slowly transforming.

However, Luo Tian knew it was only superficial. It was a temporary fix.

“Father-in-law, can you tell me what happened to Su Dan? I’ll think of a way!” Luo Tian looked at Su Peng seriously. He had carefully observed Su Dan’s condition and sensed a terrifying corrosive force within her body, constantly corroding her physical cultivation and even her soul.

This power seemed to be corrosive but was actually destructive. It was more terrifying than corrosion. Luo Tian didn’t know how this force formed, so he dared not act rashly.

“Originally, she attacked the Immortal realm and was successful. Later, she encountered a disciple from the Eternal Life Mountain of the Immortal realm. They fought, and that disciple used some method to severely injure her.”

“After the injury, Su Dan returned. Then she was escorted back here. However, on the way, she encountered an ambush and used my Zhou Gui King’s one-time prohibited technique. If it weren’t for many precious medicines and my Immortal King blood to prolong her life, she wouldn’t have lasted this long!” Su Peng spoke softly, his voice filled with helplessness.

“One-time prohibited technique!” Luo Tian whispered. He knew what this meant. Once used, it would end one’s life—like the Heavenly Demon’s Body Break. If he pushed it to its limit, the power would be terrifying but at the cost of his life. The last time was sheer luck.

“Is there a way to let her live on?” Luo Tian looked at Su Dan, who had returned to normal. Though she seemed normal, her face was still pale and weak.

“No,” Su Peng sighed. “I’ve called many Immortal realm alchemists, but they still couldn’t find a solution!”

“Alchemists?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He himself was an alchemist, and a high-level one at that. He didn’t believe in absolute impossibilities.

“Father-in-law, have those alchemists come. Let me see!” Luo Tian addressed Su Peng. Those alchemists had some knowledge and insights, and for now, he couldn’t think of a solution.

“Good!” Su Peng had no other options. He left the room and started contacting those alchemists.

Luo Tian sat at the edge of the bed, gazing at Su Dan with regret: “I’m sorry!”

“Don’t speak. Kiss me!” Su Dan had some strength now, and she embraced Luo Tian, pressing her lips against his.

Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. He felt a chill but could sense Su Dan’s passion and strong longing. At this moment, Su Dan was no longer the Zhou Gui King but his wife, Luo Tian.

After several breaths, Su Dan released Luo Tian. Her face leaned against his chest, feeling the warmth of his body. Her eyes showed satisfaction.

“Luo’er, he has some misunderstandings about you. Don’t be angry with him!” Su Dan spoke softly, her breath uneven. Her face was flushed, making one want to bite it.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded and held Su Dan without speaking.

“Also, Qiu Chan’s sister—find her. Don’t let her down!” Su Dan continued speaking, giving Luo Tian various instructions as if giving a farewell.

“I never thought I’d see you again. I’m satisfied!” Su Dan seemed to have spoken her fill and gradually leaned against Luo Tian’s chest, closing her eyes and falling asleep.

Luo Tian tightly clenched his fists. Every word Su Dan spoke made him heartbroken. His gaze was resolute.

“Luo Tian, they’ve arrived!” Su Peng’s voice echoed. Luo Tian snapped out of his thoughts and gently placed Su Dan back on the bed, leaving the room.

As soon as he stepped out of the room, Luo Tian saw several figures standing there. Their faces were hesitant.

These alchemists had been summoned by Su Peng. Although Hell and the Immortal realm were now connected, many Immortal realm cultivators still didn’t want to enter Hell. The environment in Hell was too poor.

“Which grade alchemists are you?” Luo Tian asked, looking at them. He had no great hope.

“In my case, four-grade Immortal alchemist!” An old man spoke. When he said “four-grade,” his eyes showed a hint of pride, clearly confident.

“In my case, five-grade!” The others also spoke. However, their words made Luo Tian feel disappointed. The highest was five-grade.

“Calling Jiang Xianbei and Run Hongyu now is too late!” Luo Tian muttered. Su Dan’s current condition could only last fifteen days at most. Time was insufficient.

“Speak your thoughts and understanding of her condition. Please speak!” Luo Tian looked at the alchemists, who also noticed his disappointment.

“Kid, what’s your identity?” One of the five-grade alchemists asked, looking at Luo Tian. Even though they were forced to come, they still maintained their alchemist pride. Even the Zhou Gui King treated them politely.

“Luo Tian, from Tianyuan Sect. Don’t waste words. I told you to speak your thoughts. Didn’t you hear?” Luo Tian looked at them, knowing their alchemist pride and not wanting to waste time.

“Luo Tian!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the alchemists’ faces slightly changed. They hadn’t expected to see the renowned Luo Tian here.

Chapter 2628: Effortless

“Luo Tian, what’s the difference? You need to apologize for your actions. Otherwise, we won’t act!” One alchemist shouted, his voice filled with determination. They had indeed prepared many pills for Su Dan.

Moreover, Luo Tian was famous for his combat strength. As for alchemy, they hadn’t heard of him being skilled.

“Apologize? Do you think you deserve it?” Luo Tian looked at their expressions, understanding their thoughts. He didn’t want to waste words and looked at them.

“Su Dan’s body contains a fire-elemental medicinal power. Who among you made the Tianyang Pill? A five-grade elixir!” Luo Tian looked at the five-grade alchemist.

“It was me. How? The Zhou Gui King’s body has a cold force, which needs fire-elemental to balance!” The old man looked proud upon hearing Luo Tian’s words. It was because of his Tianyang Pill that Su Dan had lived ten more days.

“Useless. Her body has a cold force, but it’s because of her physique and cultivation method. You made the Tianyang Pill to suppress this force temporarily, but after she used the prohibited technique, her physique was weakened. However, once the medicine’s effect wore off, this force would become even stronger. Moreover, the Tianyang Pill conflicts with her physique!”

“You’re not saving her but harming her, accelerating her weakness!” Luo Tian looked coldly at the five-grade alchemist.

“Is that true?” Su Peng’s face turned cold, his gaze also scanning the five-grade alchemist. If Luo Tian was telling the truth, this five-grade alchemist would not be spared.

“You know what? A young kid!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the five-grade alchemist felt his life was in danger. His forehead immediately sweat.

“Exactly! Do you know anything about elixirs? Strength alone doesn’t grant authority in alchemy!” The other alchemists also spoke, their voices filled with disdain.

“I know what? I just want to hear your thoughts. I didn’t dare to use elixirs rashly, but you’re stubborn!” Luo Tian sneered and waved his hand. A great cauldron appeared before everyone, radiating a heavy and desolate aura.

“This cauldron!” Everyone’s faces were shocked. Just the cauldron’s aura made these alchemists feel overwhelmed, knowing it was no ordinary item.

As everyone marveled, brilliant light erupted from Luo Tian’s hands. Ten-color flames surged forth, illuminating the eyes of everyone and forming a long dragon that rushed into the cauldron’s fire mouth.

“What kind of flame is this?” Everyone gasped again. They had never seen such flames before.

“I can feel it—this flame would kill me if it touched me!” The five-grade alchemist spoke, but before he could finish, his jaw dropped in disbelief.

A powerful vitality radiated from Luo Tian’s surroundings. A series of hand shadows appeared, each grasping a medicinal herb and throwing it into the cauldron.

In one breath, Luo Tian completed placing the herbs and began to refine the elixir.

A wave of heat erupted from the cauldron. Ten-color flames continuously refined the herbs, while dark clouds gathered over everyone’s heads.

“Elixir storm—grade five or above!” The old men dropped their jaws, their faces filled with disbelief. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to also be an alchemist and of such strength.

Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sound echoed. Thunder rolled within the storm clouds, and golden lightning descended from the sky, striking the cauldron.

“Fast! So fast it’s already an elixir!” Everyone was numb, especially the five-grade alchemist. He thought of how he had worked tirelessly to produce a five-grade elixir, while Luo Tian had completed an elixir in less than a hundred breaths.

A gray domain expanded. Luo Tian looked at the lightning descending from the sky and coldly spoke, “Disperse!”

Numerous spiritual souls roared, gathering into one place to form a gray spear that flew toward the lightning.

Crack...

In an instant, the lightning shattered. Luo Tian’s domain remained untouched. The gray spear even flew into the black storm clouds.

A series of roars echoed within the storm clouds. Under people’s astonished gazes, gray spear shadows swept through, and the storm cloud collapsed.

“Open!” Luo Tian extended his hand and struck. As if insignificant, a black elixir appeared before everyone’s eyes. Luo Tian extended his finger and snapped it into the hands of the alchemists, speaking coldly: “Do I have the qualifications to speak to you?”

“Six... six-grade…” They stammered, looking at the black elixir.

“A elixir so quickly and effortlessly refined into a six-grade one. His strength must be at least seven-grade!” The five-grade alchemist’s eyes immediately showed shock.

Su Peng also looked at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be an alchemist either. Seeing the expressions of those alchemists he had summoned, Luo Tian’s elixir skills were definitely superior to theirs.

“Master!” The alchemists looked respectfully, carefully holding the elixir in their hands and presenting it to Luo Tian.

“Now speak your thoughts. Please do!” Luo Tian spoke, looking at the alchemists. He was now a seven-grade Immortal alchemist and still needed to improve to reach eight-grade.

“Master, how could we dare to be bold!” The alchemists immediately became quiet. Seven-grade Immortal alchemists were esteemed guests in any Immortal realm sect, far superior to them.

“Speak!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He just wanted to understand the situation but hadn’t expected so much hassle.

“Good, since Master said it, I think we should use mild medicines to prolong her life gradually,” one four-grade alchemist spoke.

“I think…” others also spoke, but after a short while, they started arguing. Each had different ideas and none would yield.

Luo Tian watched them argue with interest. Though their grades weren’t high, their ideas were different. Moreover, they had come to Zhou Gui Wang City, and Su Peng had used the entire city’s resources to gather medicinal herbs for them. Their alchemy skills had improved significantly.

“Master, what do you think…” After an hour of arguing, they finally turned to Luo Tian. In their eyes, Luo Tian was the most authoritative.

“I need to think. Everyone, I advise you one thing—before using elixirs for others, be careful and think!” Luo Tian replied. Then he addressed Su Peng: “Father-in-law, let them go!”

Chapter 2629: Kidnapping

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the alchemists’ faces changed instantly. They misunderstood Luo Tian’s meaning. In their eyes, Hell’s strong individuals were ruthless killers.

Luo Tian’s intention was misunderstood—they thought they had no value and could be eliminated.

“Master, I wish to follow you!” The five-grade alchemist spoke loudly, his voice filled with entreaty.

“We also wish to follow you and serve in Zhou Gui Wang City!” Others also spoke, bowing repeatedly to Luo Tian.

“Everyone, you can leave. This time, I’ve caused you trouble. I owe you a favor. From now on, if there’s anything, come to my Zhou Gui Wang City!” Su Peng smiled slightly. With Luo Tian present, these people were no longer needed.

“Your Majesty!” Their hearts trembled. They had been in Zhou Gui Wang City for a long time and knew the power of the Eight Heavenly Kings. Even the Ten Palaces of Yama would give them face. Su Peng’s favor was a great gain.

“Those who wish to stay may do so; those who wish to leave may go. I won’t hinder you!” Su Peng continued, then turned to Luo Tian: “Do you have confidence?”

“No,” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. Su Dan’s condition—neither he nor Jiang Yuexiong could find a solution.

“However, I won’t give up easily!” Luo Tian spoke firmly. His gaze turned to Su Dan’s room, sensing she had awakened.

“Good. For now, spend more time with her!” Su Peng nodded and said nothing else before leaving with the alchemists.

Luo Tian turned into Su Dan’s room and spent some time with her. Soon, she fell back into deep sleep.

In the following days, Luo Tian didn’t refine elixirs but continuously calculated. Every time Su Dan awoke, he accompanied her.
