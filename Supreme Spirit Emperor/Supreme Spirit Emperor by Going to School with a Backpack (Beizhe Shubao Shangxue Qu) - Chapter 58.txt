“Let it be. This Rite of Soul inheritance is nothing to me. I have my eyes on Luo Tian’s inheritance. If we can capture Luo Tian, even if everyone here dies, it would be worth it!” Yang Huan Yu’s face bore a glint of greed as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Yang Huan Yu’s words reached the ears of several nearby figures, causing their hearts to tremble. They speculated on what secret lay within Luo Tian’s body that could make Yang Huan Yu forsake the Rite of Soul’s peak inheritance—a power wielded by the Blood Demon Ancestor, a being who had nearly stepped into the Soul-Element Stage.

“Young Master, Li Xiuping is difficult to control. I fear…” The black-cloaked figure’s face bore a look of concern as he gazed at Yang Huan Yu.

“Rest assured, I have it under control,” Yang Huan Yu said with a hint of amusement, his gaze fixed on the clashing martial arts techniques in the sky.

The thunderous clash of two opposing arts—righteous and sinister—sent shockwaves rippling through the heavens.

“Blocked?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with concern, his mind marveling at Li Xiuping’s growth while his fingers danced swiftly, continuing to unleash the Five Elements Mutual Generation Human King Seal.

“Unexpected—after so long, you still rely on these same techniques!” Li Xiuping observed the towering Human King Seal above him, a smirk playing on his lips.

“Inexhaustible Yellow Fist!” Li Xiuping roared, launching a punch that shattered the imposing Human King Seal.

The thunderous clash echoed again as both techniques canceled each other out.

“Soul-Stealing Seal!” Luo Tian ignored the blocked Human King Seal, his mastery of the Soul-Element Stage transforming his consciousness into a colossal seal that surged toward Li Xiuping.

Hearing Luo Tian’s cold voice, Li Xiuping’s expression darkened. The Soul-Stealing Seal was a force he could not ignore; he still remembered how Luo Tian had once hurled Old Lan into the air with it. At that time, he hadn’t realized consciousness could be wielded so powerfully.

Not daring to let his guard down, Li Xiuping darted forward like a whirlwind, leaving behind ghostly afterimages on the ground.

“Think you can outrun my consciousness?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smirk as his consciousness guided the Soul-Stealing Seal, radiating terrifying energy toward Li Xiuping.

The thunderous clash rang out again as Luo Tian’s Soul-Stealing Seal smashed into Li Xiuping with a resounding thud.

“Hit!” Ying Hongtu and the others wore expressions of joy, knowing that once struck by Luo Tian’s Soul-Stealing Seal, Li Xiuping would face inevitable doom.

At that moment, Luo Tian leapt into the air and unhesitatingly unleashed the Punishing Soul Vessel.

Thunder rumbled as the vessel, heavy with its oppressive aura, descended upon Li Xiuping.

“Pang…” The thunderous sound echoed across the battlefield, merging with the aura of an Earth-Level Weapon and the vessel’s weighty presence. The battlefield seemed to pause as all felt their minds tremble under its might.

Smoke billowed as Luo Tian landed before the vessel, his brows furrowed in concentration. Though he felt it had struck Li Xiuping, a lingering doubt gnawed at him—Li Xiuping was not so easily defeated.

“Young Master, Li Xiuping…” The black-cloaked figure addressed Yang Huan Yu.

“Nothing to worry about. Such an attack would not kill Li Xiuping. Remember, he is Luo Tian’s enemy. If he fell so easily, he would not be worthy of being his opponent!” Yang Huan Yu smiled faintly.

“Indeed, this is an Earth-Level Weapon! Regrettable that you cannot harness even a fraction of its power, relying instead on brute force. If you could wield it properly, I might have fallen here today!”

Li Xiuping’s voice rose slowly.

Luo Tian’s gaze flickered with surprise as a pool of blood oozed from the vessel, sending shockwaves through the onlookers.

“Blood Transmutation! This Li Xiuping is truly formidable—he has mastered the Blood Demon Ancestor’s technique!” The black-cloaked figure at Yang Huan Yu’s side gasped in alarm, staring at the blood pool with disbelief.

“He has not yet mastered it fully—only a fragment. But beneath that vessel, he must have been wounded!” Yang Huan Yu observed Li Xiuping’s gradual recovery with a hint of surprise. Even he had not expected Li Xiuping to grasp Blood Transmutation so swiftly; he had assumed it would take until the late Bone-Transformation Stage.

A pool of blood transformed into Li Xiuping’s form, though his face was pale.

“What is this? It doesn’t even kill him! Is he human?” The crowd gasped, bewildered by how Li Xiuping had risen from a pool of blood.

“You cannot kill me, Luo Tian!” Li Xiuping’s lips curled in mockery.

Luo Tian’s heart quivered—this world had no equal to such a technique. He now understood: Li Xiuping must have transformed into the blood pool at the moment the vessel struck him.

“Once won’t do—try twice… if not, three times! I’ll show you how many times this technique can be used!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Li Xiuping’s pale face as he launched another step of the Sealing Step, appearing before him.

Seeing Luo Tian charge again, Li Xiuping let out another laugh, his bloodstained aura radiating menace as he lunged forward without hesitation.

Chapter 283: Li Xiuping’s Secret Weapon

The nameless town seemed washed in blood, its streets littered with corpses of the Tianshi Sect and Northern Domain sect disciples. The sky was stained crimson by their blood.

Luo Tian and Li Xiuping clashed repeatedly, like two ravenous beasts, leaving onlookers stunned.

Ying Hongtu and Bai Zhantian watched Li Xiuping’s fierce battle with Luo Tian, their faces etched with bitterness. They knew Luo Tian was formidable—no peer among his generation. Yet this bloodstained youth could match him, proving Li Xiuping had closed the gap with astonishing speed.

Even Lei Yong and Ji Chen, both at the late Bone-Transformation Stage, bore expressions of apprehension. Their attacks would leave them exhausted, and a single mistake could cost them dearly.

“Little Brother has truly reached our level now!” Lei Yong mused, recalling the time he had met Luo Tian—just a lowly Cultivation Body Stage disciple who could have been crushed by his spit. Two years later, Luo Tian had grown to this extent.

Ji Chen’s cold face softened slightly as he nodded in approval.

The thunderous clash echoed again, the two now exhausted, especially Luo Tian, who was desperate—his time was nearly up.

“End it now!” Li Xiuping retreated, knowing he could not match Luo Tian’s strength. Having already used Blood Transmutation twice in their brief exchange, his energy was depleted.

He quickly manipulated his crimson energy, gathering it into his palms.

The energy flowed into his fingers, compressing further.

“Destroying Demon Blood Claws!” A crimson hand materialized in the sky, radiating terrifying pressure.

“The Earth-Level Martial Art!” The onlookers gasped at the hand’s aura.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened—though he possessed an Earth-Level Art, it was for escape. His Sealing Step had only reached the second stage; he dared not attempt the third.

“Little Brother, leave it to us!” Lei Yong and Ji Chen stepped forward, their faces tense.

“Rest easy—I can do it!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with determination, urging them back.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen exchanged glances, sensing the terrifying power of the Destroying Demon Blood Claws. Even they would struggle to withstand it.

“Why not run?” Li Xiuping sneered, seeing Luo Tian prepare to face his Earth-Level Art.

“Why run?” Luo Tian exhaled softly, a playful smirk on his face as he moved his hands.

“You don’t know what my Bone-Transformation Stage’s bone is? I’ll tell you—five fingers. Originally, I had two attributes; this crimson energy gives me three. I could have had three bones, but I carved all three into these five fingers. Thus, this single bone equals three ordinary ones! This Destroying Demon Blood Claws is an Earth-Level Art, and with my bone’s power, it becomes three times stronger. What will you use to resist?” Li Xiuping’s face glowed with confidence, his mockery evident.

The onlookers paused, their expressions dawning in realization. They marveled at Li Xiuping’s audacity—sacrificing two bones to refine one.

Even Yang Huan Yu bore a flicker of surprise, never expecting Li Xiuping to be so ruthless.

Yet when they saw the terrifying bloodclaw in the sky, they understood why Li Xiuping had done it. This Earth-Level Art, enhanced thrice by his bone, surpassed even the middle-tier Earth-Level Arts.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed in comprehension as he swiftly formed the Five Elements Mutual Generation Human King Seal with his left hand and the Soul-Stealing Seal with his right.

Li Xiuping sneered, “Still relying on these two seals to block my Destroying Demon Blood Claws? Dream on! If I were you, I’d run now!”

“You’ve used your last trick, haven’t you? You must be low on energy after such a powerful technique!” Luo Tian mocked, his hands forming the two seals.

“Low energy? What does that matter? Even a late Bone-Transformation Stage master would fall to this! I could even injure a peak-level one!” Li Xiuping’s face twisted with madness as he quickened his claw’s formation.

“Indeed, it is strong—but you’ll never kill me. I survived the Great An Forest; from then on, your chance to kill me was gone. Today, you lack the luck you had before. No one can stop me from killing you!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with madness.

The Human King Seal and Soul-Stealing Seal coalesced under Luo Tian’s immense energy, yet he did not hurl them immediately. Instead, his hands moved together in slow unison.

“What is he doing?” Lei Yong’s eyes widened with confusion.

Ji Chen, observing Luo Tian’s actions, shook his head, sharing the same bewilderment with others. Though they knew Luo Tian wielded these two seals, they had never seen him combine them before.

Under the onlookers’ puzzled gazes, Luo Tian’s hands slowly converged, sweat streaming down his face. Clearly, he was not faring well.

“Hum…” A powerful energy wave radiated from the two seals above.

The onlookers gasped as the two seals collided, emitting a deafening hum.

“He’s suicidal! Is he trying to merge the two arts? Impossible! How could two different techniques fuse?” The Bone-Transformation Stage geniuses gasped, their expressions stunned as the two seals devoured each other.

Chapter 284: Martial Art Fusion—Huangji Seal

Everyone realized Luo Tian was seeking death.

Since the inception of martial arts, no one had dared to fuse two techniques—such an act was tantamount to suicide. Though some had attempted it, the result was always destruction by chaotic energy.

Even masters of the Rite of Soul and Soul-Element Stages could not achieve this, yet Luo Tian sought to merge two techniques. It was a dream of madness.

“Luo Tian! Don’t be reckless!” Lei Yong shouted, desperate to stop him. Even he did not believe Luo Tian could pull off such a feat.

Ji Chen’s face bore concern, but he did not intervene—Luo Tian had already fused half the seals.

“Suicidal! Trying to fight for his life? I’ll see how you die!” Li Xiuping, seeing Luo Tian’s move, sneered. He slowed his energy flow into the Destroying Demon Blood Claws.

“Is he suicidal?” The black-cloaked figure beside Yang Huan Yu’s face paled.

Yang Huan Yu furrowed his brows, doubting Luo Tian’s success. Yet he knew Luo Tian was not reckless.

“Big Brother!” Long Baobao heard the cries and sensed Luo Tian’s peril. His childish face bore worry, his small hands gripping Baihu’s fur tightly.

But Baihu seemed oblivious to the pain, its emerald eyes fixed on the two seals above. It felt a terrifying energy between them—nothing short of apocalyptic.

All eyes were fixed on the two seals, some mocking, others wary, and some fearful.

Yet Luo Tian seemed oblivious, his eyes locked on the seals, his consciousness absorbing every detail of their fusion. He dared not miss a single moment—any mistake would turn his energy into an explosive death trap.

This was Luo Tian’s first attempt, but not without basis. At the Bone-Transformation Stage, his consciousness had already reached the Soul-Element Stage. Now, at the middle Bone-Transformation Stage, his consciousness had surged further—into the early Soul-Element Stage.

Entering the Soul-Element Stage meant Luo Tian could attempt to open the next page of the Epoch Book, which detailed the fusion method of these two seals. This was why he dared to try—otherwise, even a hundred boldness would not have sufficed.

“Two-thirds… three-quarters…” Luo Tian’s gaze remained intense, his entire being focused on the two seals.

“Unbelievable!” The crowd gasped as they felt Luo Tian nearing completion, sensing the terrifying energy in the sky. Their hearts trembled.

Li Xiuping felt the fusion process, his expression shifting from mockery to alarm. He sensed the energy of Luo Tian’s fused seals could rival his Destroying Demon Blood Claws, even surpassing it slightly.

“Destroying Demon Blood Claws—crush!” Li Xiuping no longer hesitated, channeling his last energy and even three drops of blood to complete the technique. He launched it toward Luo Tian.

The crimson claw, heavy with pressure, descended upon the vacuum around Luo Tian. The onlookers could see its sharp claws slicing through space, creating fractures in the air.

“This Li Xiuping is truly formidable—no one in the Northern Domain can match him unless Luo Tian’s fusion succeeds! Otherwise, he’ll be the top of his generation!” The crowd murmured.

As the bloodclaw descended, a more terrifying energy formed in the sky—a golden seal with an indistinct “Huang” character, radiating imperial authority. Some weaker Cultivation Body Stage disciples trembled uncontrollably under its might.

Luo Tian’s face lit with joy as he roared, “Success! Huangji Seal—crush!”

“He did it!” The crowd whispered in awe, their disbelief palpable.

“Someone actually fused two martial arts! I’ve seen it with my own eyes! And this person… is my uncle!” Wang Tianxiang’s face burned with fervor, gazing at the golden seal above.

“This era… belongs to Luo Tian!” Ying Hongtu and Bai Zhantian, seeing Luo Tian standing in the vacuum, no longer harbored rivalry. Their admiration was boundless—Luo Tian had achieved what even masters could not, a miracle destined to echo across the Tianyuan Continent for millennia.

“Little Brother! Well done!” Lei Yong shouted, while Ji Chen’s face bore a rare expression of admiration.

“Roar…” Baihu howled, but not in joy. It had finally regained its senses, feeling pain on its back—its fur had been plucked by Long Baobao.

“Though I don’t know what you’re happy about, my brother is no ordinary person!” Long Baobao stopped plucking Baihu’s fur, standing atop it and dancing joyfully.

As the crowd marveled, Luo Tian’s lips curled into a sinister smile: “I told you—today, you can’t escape!”

The Soul-Element Stage consciousness controlled the Huangji Seal, not toward Li Xiuping’s bloodclaw but directly at him.

Everyone was stunned—expecting Luo Tian to use the seal against the bloodclaw, they never imagined he would choose this near-suicidal move.

Li Xiuping’s face paled in shock, never expecting Luo Tian to act thusly. He had no time to flee; a single moment’s hesitation saw the seal land on his head, its pressure making even movement difficult.

Luo Tian faced the same dilemma—his body was ensnared by the bloodclaw.

Chapter 285: Luo Tian’s Bone-Transformation Stage

The thunderous clash silenced the battlefield of tens of thousands.

For a moment, everything seemed to pause as people were drawn to the source of this immense energy. Yet they soon returned to their slaughter, unable to glimpse Luo Tian’s battlefield.

The Huangji Seal landed on Li Xiuping, creating a deep, bottomless hole under the crowd’s stunned gaze.

“Gush… gush…” A fountain of blood erupted, thick with the scent of death.

“Is Li Xiuping dead?” The crowd murmured, watching a pool of blood on the ground.

“Crack…” A sharp sound drew their attention back to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was entirely wrapped in the crimson claw, feeling its sharp scent. Yet he cared little for it—this bloodclaw could crush anything.

The sound of cracking bones echoed as Luo Tian’s arms bulged, his face flushed red with blood spilling from his mouth.

“Brave fool! How reckless to choose a life-for-life exchange! What now?”

“Crack… crack…” The sound of Luo Tian’s body echoed continuously.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen wore anxious expressions, watching their friend ensnared by the crimson claw. They had no means to save him—this was an Earth-Level Art, beyond their power.

“Pang…” A surge of water-element energy spread as Qinglin Xuan Shui Armor shattered under the bloodclaw’s pressure, leaving Luo Tian’s torso exposed.

“An Earth-Level High-Grade Inner Armor! Yet it couldn’t withstand the Destroying Demon Blood Claws!” The crowd gasped, watching the red hand.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly—this Earth-Level Art was truly astonishing; even Qinglin Xuan Shui Armor had only lasted three breaths.

“Want me to die? Not so easy!” Luo Tian’s face hardened, his remaining energy gathering at his body.

“Still trying to resist?” Yang Huan Yu watched with interest, his face alight with curiosity.

Others stared intently at Luo Tian, eager to see if he could create another miracle.

Long Baobao’s hand instinctively reached for Baihu’s back again, his face tense as he felt the terrifying pressure of the bloodclaw.

Luo Tian dared not breathe; one mistake would see him crushed instantly.

“Bone-Transformation Stage! Come forth!” Luo Tian’s mind roared.

Under the crowd’s hopeful gaze, Luo Tian’s arms glowed with earth-element energy.

“Not enough!” Luo Tian roared again, his legs glowing blue.

“Bone-Transformation Stage! Luo Tian is using it! My god, he’s activating the Bone-Transformation Stage now! He has five attributes—does that mean five bones?” The crowd shouted, eager to see what the other bones were.

“Wood-element Bone-Transformation Stage! Come forth!” Luo Tian’s mind roared again, his chest filled with fire-red energy.

“Three! Only two left!” The crowd shouted.

Luo Tian sighed, his lips bitter—he knew where the remaining two bones were and how useless they seemed now.

Thinking of the other two bones, he felt like cursing. He remembered how the wood-element bone had landed on his ring finger, frustrating him endlessly.

Even worse was the gold-element bone’s choice of teeth—this made him want to curse the heavens.

Though bones on fingers were manageable, those on teeth were absurd—what use was there in biting an opponent?

“Teeth! Yes, teeth!” Luo Tian’s mind sparked with a bold idea. He grinned, revealing golden light.

“What are the remaining two bones?” The crowd wondered.

They soon saw Luo Tian’s golden teeth, their mouths twitching in disbelief. “Can teeth even be turned into Bone-Transformation Stages?”

But Luo Tian’s next move left them speechless.

“Crack!” His golden teeth bit into the crimson claw, drawing in a pure blood-energy.

The entire red claw shrank by one finger under the crowd’s shock.

“Can this even work?” Not only did others stare, but Lei Yong and Ji Chen were also stunned, watching Luo Tian’s bizarre use of teeth to bite the claw.

Luo Tian didn’t care—he bit furiously, blood-energy flowing into his body.

The Epoch Book’s final page slowly opened, absorbing every bit of energy.

Yet as the book opened in Luo Tian’s mind, Yang Huan Yu’s face lit with excitement. “It is you! Definitely the Epoch Book!”

“The Epoch Book? Young Master, what is it?” The black-cloaked figure beside Yang Huan Yu asked, puzzled by his sudden excitement.

“Don’t ask! Relay my order—no matter the cost, capture Luo Tian today, even if it means total annihilation!” Yang Huan Yu shouted, his voice echoing through every Tianshi Sect warrior’s ears.

“Roar…” The Tianshi Sect warriors seemed to have taken a stimulant, rushing toward Luo Tian. They resumed the chaos.

“Stop them! If Luo Tian is captured, they’ll escape many of us. If they hide, it will be hard to gather so many Tianshi Sect warriors again!” Everyone understood that Luo Tian was the key.

But Luo Tian ignored it all, his face anxious—his time was running out. He bit furiously.

“One breath… two breaths…” Time passed, and under Luo Tian’s relentless consumption, the Earth-Level Mid-Stage Destroying Demon Blood Claws shrank to two fingers under the crowd’s shock.

Chapter 286: Strike Back

The onlookers stared at the claw reduced to two fingers, their faces twitching. They had never seen a technique so thoroughly dismantled.

“Is it… eaten?” Ying Hongtu and Bai Zhantian gaped.

“This is absurd!” The black-cloaked figure beside Yang Huan Yu could not find words. He knew the crimson energy’s ferocity; he had trained in it. Yet this was devoured by Luo Tian—his stomach felt like it was made of stone.

Luo Tian had no time to ponder; he counted the minutes, observing the two thick fingers wrapped around him. His face smiled—after losing three fingers, this Earth-Level Mid-Stage Art’s power had greatly diminished.

Yet his face remained tense; without the bones on his legs, chest, and arms, he might not have lasted long enough to devour more than half of the claw. He silently thanked his teeth for this chance.

All these coincidences meant that without one, Luo Tian would have been crushed today.

“Time is up!” Feeling his blood flow faster than before, Luo Tian smiled again.

“Open!” Luo Tian’s arms trembled, earth-element energy surging through his right arm. The dimmed bone glowed with a brownish light again.

“Is it about to open?” Lei Yong and others watched, anticipation in their eyes as they awaited Luo Tian’s breakthrough.

“Crack…” A grating sound echoed from Luo Tian, his arms tensed as he struggled against the bloodclaw.

“Open!” Luo Tian roared again, his power surging—those two fingers finally broke under the crowd’s shock.

“Roar…” Luo Tian roared, his Bone-Transformation Stage Mid-Level power erupting in the final moment. This was his last chance to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage.

“Ha… ha…” Long Baobao yawned, his face showing sleepiness.

“Pang… pang…” Two heavy sounds echoed as the Destroying Demon Blood Claws dissolved into a sky of crimson energy.

The energy dispersed, revealing Luo Tian panting heavily. His body bore deep, thick scars—evidence of the bloodclaw’s touch.

“I’m leaving! Goodbye, little cat!” Long Baobao waved, transforming into a golden dragon and returning to the seal on Luo Tian’s back.

As Long Baobao returned, Dragon Emperor’s reverse scale fell from Luo Tian’s back into his hand.

The crowd regarded Luo Tian with admiration; though his method was bizarre, he had dismantled the Earth-Level Art.

Recovering, Luo Tian quickly took several pills to restore his strength. He did not know what would happen in this battlefield of tens of thousands, but Yang Huan Yu and his backline’s Bone-Transformation Stage black-cloaked figures had yet to move. For now, every bit of strength was precious—even a Cultivation Body Stage disciple had more chances to survive.

Yet he soon gasped, seeing several drops of blood gathering and rising into the air, appearing in his view.

“What is this?” Luo Tian wondered, observing where the blood appeared before his face darkened.

“You still haven’t died! A real cockroach!” Luo Tian, regaining some energy, moved swiftly to the blood drop. Before it could react, he produced a jade bottle and captured the blood inside.

“Perfect—take you to Yun Ting’s grave!” Luo Tian’s face bore a ruthless glint as he muttered.

“Is this blood Li Xiuping? He’s still alive?” Lei Yong and Ji Chen appeared before Luo Tian, asking softly.

“Indeed, this blood carries a familiar aura! It must be Li Xiuping!” Luo Tian replied softly.

“Li Xiuping is truly a formidable opponent. Even like this, he survives. I barely managed to withstand your attack!” Lei Yong patted Luo Tian’s shoulder.

After taking the pills, Luo Tian’s injuries were nearly healed. Yet his face showed no relief—this was just the tip of the iceberg in this battlefield. More importantly, the Soul-Element Stage battlefield above was where the true battle would decide victory or defeat.

“Kill!” The cries of war echoed as corpses fell before Luo Tian’s eyes. He felt a sudden distaste for killing, longing to find a quiet place to rest.

“Kill! All of you—charge at Luo Tian, even if it means surrounding him to death!” Yang Huan Yu, with a ring on his hand, rubbed it and issued the order.

“Go too!” After issuing the command, Yang Huan Yu ordered several Bone-Transformation Stage black-cloaked figures behind him.

“Yes!” Hearing Yang Huan Yu’s command, several shadows vanished from his presence, merging into the crowd.

Seeing the Tianshi Sect warriors rushing toward him like madmen, Luo Tian’s face darkened. Due to his clash with Li Xiuping, they had ventured deep into the Tianshi Sect’s heart. Escape would be difficult for now.

But these problems were minor compared to the terrifying Bone-Transformation Stage presence hidden among the crowd—these were their greatest fears. A Bone-Transformation Stage master was far stronger than a late-stage one, just one step away from the Soul-Element Stage.

“Break through!” Lei Yong shouted, his body crackling with lightning. His eyes bore a fierce intent.

“Kill!” Twenty or so geniuses and dozens of disciples followed Lei Yong, surrounding Luo Tian as they roared toward their escape route.

This group was like messengers of hell, ruthlessly harvesting the Tianshi Sect warriors’ lives. A road of blood was formed under their feet.

They knew that returning to the sect’s camp would ensure Luo Tian’s safety—many Bone-Transformation Stage masters from various sects had arrived, though they were scattered for now.

The major sects’ Bone-Transformation Stage masters felt the presence of the hidden strong figures among the Tianshi Sect crowd, gathering toward one place. They roared as they rushed toward those powerful figures, leaving a trail of Tianshi Sect and traitor corpses.

Chapter 287: Epilogue

The flattened town continued its slaughter, the number of dead growing with time. The Tianshi Sect’s one or two thousand plus a thousand defectors, nearly three thousand, had suffered heavy losses. The allied forces of the major sects were also devastated—ten thousand strong, now half-dead.

Throughout the conflict, Luo Tian and Lei Yong’s group fought fiercely. Though small in number, they shone brightly on the battlefield of tens of thousands. These few were top-tier geniuses, their strength far surpassing ordinary Bone-Transformation Stage disciples. Their tactics were endless.

Yet despite this, they were scattered by the army. Only a few true geniuses remained behind Luo Tian and Lei Yong.

These twenty or so individuals, drenched in blood and bearing wounds of all sizes, had survived against the odds. Though they were extraordinary, surviving in such a battlefield was no small feat.
