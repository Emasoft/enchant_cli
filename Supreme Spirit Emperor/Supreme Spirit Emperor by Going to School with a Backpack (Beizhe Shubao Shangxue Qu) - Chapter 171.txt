“Senior Brother Luo Tian! Are you alright?” Seeing Luo Tian’s condition, people’s faces bore expressions of gratitude. Upon seeing his weakened state, even those who had intended to break free from the divine-binding belt and leave were somewhat ashamed to depart.

“I’m fine. Yimeng, organize everyone; we’re heading to the Eastern Peace Continent to establish our base!” Luo Tian spoke, issuing orders to Jiang Yimeng while continuously restoring the eight sources of origin within his body.

Jiang Yimeng heard Luo Tian’s words and swiftly began organizing the group. After all, relocating a million people was quite chaotic.

Under Jiang Yimeng’s leadership, the group quickly regained order beneath the starry sky. Naturally, some took advantage of the chaos to quietly leave the group.

Though they tried to vanish unnoticed, their departure did not escape the eyes of the crowd. Eventually, about ten thousand people silently departed, leaving roughly ninety thousand remaining.

Luo Tian nodded in satisfaction. Ninety thousand was far more than he had anticipated; originally, he had considered it a blessing if half remained.

Indeed, the survival of ninety thousand people stemmed from their faith in Luo Tian. At such a young age, he had already attained the status of Seven-source Supreme Lord, fully capable of leading a typical sect. Otherwise, under cultivation world rules, those who stayed out of gratitude would not have exceeded half—perhaps even fewer.

“Alright. Please excuse me, and inform the sect masters: From today forward, I Luo Tian have completely severed ties with the Blue Dragon Sect. On the Eastern Peace Continent, I shall join the Heavenly Yuan Sect! Seven days from now, my Heavenly Yuan Sect will hold its founding ceremony. I hope all sect masters can grace us with your presence!” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed the surrounding onlookers. His voice was not loud, yet it sent a tremor through their hearts.

“Luo Tian has defected from the Blue Dragon Sect! Why? And he’s taken so many followers. Most astonishingly, the Blue Dragon Sect seems to have no reaction!” The onlookers were stunned, gazing at Luo Tian with disbelief and immediately spreading the news to their sects.

As the crowd relayed the information, soon every major and minor sect across the Four Sacred Starfields learned of the top-ranked powerhouse—the Blue Dragon Sect’s number one prodigy, Luo Tian, defecting to another sect and holding its founding ceremony seven days later on the Eastern Peace Continent.

This news spread like a storm across the Four Sacred Starfields. Everyone was discussing Luo Tian and the Heavenly Yuan Sect, curious about what kind of sect could entice such a prodigy to join.

“Founding ceremony?” Jin Yongsi held a jade token, listening to his disciple from the White Tiger Sect’s report. A faint smile crossed his face.

“Ko Zhen Tian has lost two of his most outstanding descendants. I suppose he won’t miss this boy now. Last time, Ko Zhen Tian refused to burn his origin, but I wonder if he’ll go all out this time!” Jin Yongsi muttered quietly.

“Regrettably, I’ve just recovered to the Seven-source Supreme Lord level. Otherwise, I could have joined Ko Zhen Tian in killing this boy!” Jin Yongsi finished speaking and vanished from the spot.

At the same time, within the Vermilion Bird Sect, Ko Zhen Tian’s face was dark with fury. He gazed at the disheveled Vermilion Bird Sect before turning toward the Eastern Peace Continent.

“Xin Shui, Xin Die! Rest easy. I will avenge you!” Ko Zhen Tian’s eyes brimmed with killing intent, his voice as cold as ice. The reporting disciple instinctively trembled.

“Convey my orders: Seven days from now, all disciples of the Vermilion Bird Sect shall head to the Eastern Peace Continent to attend the Heavenly Yuan Sect’s founding ceremony!” Ko Zhen Tian’s face twisted with ferocity as he issued the command to his sect members.

The ancient tortoise of the Black Tortoise Sect floated leisurely through the stars. Beneath the starry sky, Chen Xuanning stood before the tortoise, recounting information obtained from his disciples.

Upon hearing Chen Xuanning’s words, the tortoise’s wrinkled eyes slowly opened and then closed again. Though it still appeared leisurely, Chen Xuanning sensed that the tortoise’s direction was indeed the Eastern Peace Continent.

“Alas… Though I’ve ascended to Eight-source, Sha Cangmang and the others have reached Nine-source. Now, only with my combined strength with Master Black Tortoise can I possibly hold them back. I hope they won’t unleash more bloodshed. Why do these three old men never understand the virtue of mercy?” Chen Xuanning spoke solemnly, causing the tortoise’s lips to twitch slightly.

It was unclear what illness Chen Xuanning had contracted, but his mouth seemed blessed. Every time he spoke this sentence, misfortune inevitably followed—someone would die.

“Alas…” A long sigh echoed through the endless stars, though it was unclear whether it came from Chen Xuanning or the Black Tortoise.

Chapter 804: Founding Ceremony

The Four Sacred Starfields, the Eastern Peace Continent. Though not large, the Eastern Peace Continent easily accommodated the ninety thousand people Luo Tian had brought back.

With these ninety thousand added, the Eastern Peace Continent’s overall strength underwent a qualitative leap. No longer was a world-destroying realm master an omnipotent figure.

During Luo Tian’s absence, Jiang Sizhi had not been idle. She had either recruited or expelled all Blue Dragon Sect disciples stationed on the Eastern Peace Continent.

In just a few days, the Eastern Peace Continent had become entirely Jiang Sizhi’s domain. Her words were as sacred as imperial edicts.

Upon Luo Tian’s return, Jiang Sizhi had intended to offer him the sect master position. However, Luo Tian declined. He was truly unskilled in managing a sect; he knew even Jiang Yimeng surpassed him greatly in this regard.

Under Jiang Sizhi’s exasperated gaze, she reluctantly became the first sect master of the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

As Jiang Sizhi served as sect master, no one dared to object. Those who had followed Luo Tian understood the relationship between Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi. Though they still hoped Luo Tian would be sect master, no complaints arose. In their eyes, as long as Luo Tian remained in the Heavenly Yuan Sect, they would stay!

Three days later, everyone on the Eastern Peace Continent knew of a new formidable sect—the Heavenly Yuan Sect. It was like a godlike presence.

The Heavenly Yuan Sect also announced that after its founding ceremony seven days later, it would begin recruiting disciples. This news sent the Eastern Peace Continent into a frenzy. The highest realm there was world-destroying, and world-destroying masters were absolute rulers.

The Heavenly Yuan Sect’s recent activities had become known across the small continent. Particularly, the powerful fluctuations radiating from each disciple made world-destroying masters on the Eastern Peace Continent tremble.

For young people yearning for cultivation, this was a powerful shock. Increasing numbers flocked toward the Heavenly Yuan Sect, awaiting its disciple recruitment ceremony after the founding ceremony.

Meanwhile, representatives from various sects across the Four Sacred Starfields also hurried toward the Eastern Peace Continent. Though no one knew why, most attributed it to Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi being two Imperial-grade alchemists.

Unaware of the commotion outside, Luo Tian knew that openly declaring the Heavenly Yuan Sect’s establishment meant it would not be easy to open. The four major sects alone would not easily let him hold a smooth founding ceremony.

“Buzz…” Eight terrifying sources of origin slowly emerged from Luo Tian’s body. Opening his eyes, after several days of restoration, Luo Tian had finally recovered to the Eight-source Supreme Lord level.

Jiang Sizhi had also remained indoors these two days, restoring the burned origin sources with Luo Tian’s chaos power. She had regained to the Six-source Supreme Lord level.

They sat on a large bed, gazing at each other. Luo Tian saw infinite shyness in Jiang Sizhi’s eyes, causing his lower abdomen to heat up. He gently kissed her face.

Jiang Sizhi perhaps had recovered her strength, or for other reasons. She showed no anger at all, merely standing up and stepping off the bed. “Let’s go. We’ve been away for several days; I wonder how the sect is progressing!”

Luo Tian also slowly rose, adjusting his attire and approaching Jiang Sizhi. “Master Sect Leader, please!” he smiled.

“Hmph…” Jiang Sizhi glared at Luo Tian with a sultry gaze, letting out a light hum before striding out of the room.

Luo Tian followed closely, regaining his usual demeanor as he exited the room behind Jiang Sizhi.

As they stepped out of the room, they saw bustling disciples. Streams of light continuously flew above the Heavenly Yuan Sect’s domain. The mountain renamed by Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi, the Heavenly Yuan Mountain, was lively.

“Master, Mistress!” Jiang Yimeng wore an odd expression as she saw them exit the room. She flew toward Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi, bowing respectfully. During their absence, the entire sect had been managed by Jiang Yimeng alone.

Seeing Jiang Yimeng’s odd gaze, Jiang Sizhi blushed slightly. A young man and woman coexisting in the same room for several days—people would naturally speculate.

“Little girl, don’t think too much. We were just restoring our strength!” Jiang Sizhi explained. In recent days, due to both sharing the surname Jiang, she and Jiang Yimeng had gotten along well.

Jiang Sizhi’s explanation was unnecessary. It sounded like she felt guilty, making Jiang Yimeng’s gaze even more suggestive.

Luo Tian quickly changed the subject: “How has the sect been these days? Any problems?”

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s question, Jiang Yimeng’s face showed a proud expression. “Everything has been smooth. The sect is now largely operating normally. None of the people from the Blue Dragon Sect have had issues. Moreover, several sects nearby have sent greetings, and their numbers keep increasing. I’ve already arranged accommodations for them!”

Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi listened to Jiang Yimeng’s report. Luo Tian’s eyes bore contemplation, while Jiang Sizhi’s gaze held a hint of concern.

Normally, their strength would have been more than enough to establish a sect. They also knew that they had become irreconcilable enemies with the Vermilion Bird Sect, and the Blue Dragon Sect was completely at odds. The White Tiger Sect had also been offended by Luo Tian long ago. Only the Black Tortoise Sect remained relatively amicable. Thus, they had never expected their sect’s founding to proceed smoothly.

Especially with the Vermilion Bird Sect and White Tiger Sect, Jiang Sizhi was aware of what Luo Tian had done in the Divine Realm. When she learned that Luo Tian had nearly annihilated both sects’ Seven-source Supreme Lords, she even decided not to establish a sect and instead wander the world with Luo Tian as a pair of fugitives.

But Luo Tian had repeatedly assured her there would be no danger, and even if there was, they would have a chance to escape.

“With so many sects? Good. Facing so many sects, I suppose the Four Major Sects won’t dare to attack us. If they do, where would their faces be? As for other sects? Heh… whoever dares to step forward will ultimately become my stepping stone to震慑 other sects!”

Luo Tian’s eyes sparkled with brilliance, a killing intent stirring within him.

After discussing matters with Jiang Yimeng, Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi returned to their room. A barrier sealed the entire room, making external forces unable to sense any fluctuations within.

Time flowed slowly. The day of the Heavenly Yuan Sect’s founding finally arrived. Jiang Sizhi sat on Luo Tian’s bed, while Luo Tian stood before her with a smile.

“Buzz…” A powerful fluctuation spread. Jiang Sizhi’s body was enveloped in black qi, her face bearing solemnity.

“Boom… Boom…” A loud sound echoed within Jiang Sizhi’s body, causing Luo Tian to narrow his eyes slightly.

“Timing was perfect! Three days to master the darkness attribute source. Sizhi truly is more monstrous than me!” Luo Tian nodded slightly, astonished by Jiang Sizhi’s talent.

Jiang Sizhi slowly opened her eyes. Two meteors seemed to fall into her eyes, illuminating the room’s endless darkness. The black origin sources surged back into Jiang Sizhi’s body.

“Seven-source Supreme Lord!” Jiang Sizhi clenched her fist, smiling gently at Luo Tian as if everything were natural.

“Having ascended to Seven-source Supreme Lord, shouldn’t I thank you?” Luo Tian approached Jiang Sizhi, gently running his fingers through her disheveled hair.

“Let me offer myself to you!” Jiang Sizhi winked at Luo Tian, extending her jade hand to draw circles on his chest.

“Good…” Luo Tian had never seen Jiang Sizhi in such a妩媚 manner. He instinctively spoke.

“Boom…” In the next moment, Luo Tian’s figure appeared outside the room, crashing onto the ground and kicking up a cloud of dust.

“Cough… Cough…” Luo Tian got up, looking at several disciples watching him. He coughed lightly and coldly said: “Hmph, your sect master ascended to Seven-source Supreme Lord. The fluctuation was too strong and knocked me out!”

People looked at Luo Tian’s back, seeing a black footprint. They wanted to laugh but dared not; instead, they nodded: “Congratulations on your ascension to Seven-source!”

“Good. These elixirs, take them. Remember, keep the news of your sect master’s ascension to Seven-source secret. Don’t spread it!” Luo Tian nodded solemnly, pulling out several elixirs from his sleeve and handing them to the disciples.

“Do you have so many elixirs?” As Luo Tian handed out the elixirs, a cold voice echoed. Jiang Sizhi appeared from the room with an authoritative expression, having already changed into a robe prepared by Jiang Yimeng.

Jiang Sizhi’s emergence made Luo Tian and the others’ faces brighten slightly. Jiang Sizhi was naturally a beauty, but with this authoritative attire, she exuded another kind of majestic beauty. The attendants instinctively showed admiration, gazing at Luo Tian with reverence for having conquered such a woman.

Seeing the others’ gazes, Luo Tian knew their thoughts and wore an air of pride. He followed Jiang Sizhi.

“Come, let’s attend the founding ceremony!” Jiang Sizhi’s eyes flashed coldly. She strode to the front of the crowd, heading toward the mountain’s front gate.

Chapter 805: Suppression

On the Eastern Peace Continent, it was bustling. Everyone knew that today a sect would be established.

For any sect, its founding day is significant. At this moment, the massive mountain renamed Heavenly Yuan was filled with representatives from other continents, their faces showing admiration.

“This founding ceremony’s excitement rivals the ranking battle!” A respected sect master said, smiling at other familiar masters from different continents.

“I didn’t want to come either. Two Imperial-grade alchemists aren’t worth my personal attendance, but I couldn’t refuse Ko Zhen Tian’s message from the Vermilion Bird Sect. Could I not come?” A Seven-source Supreme Lord spoke, his eyes showing envy. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be a disciple of the Blue Dragon Sect and have connections with the Vermilion Bird Sect’s Ko Zhen Tian.

After exchanging words, they realized Luo Tian had ties with all four major sects. Because they had received messages from the four sect masters, they had come to this founding ceremony.

“Who exactly is Luo Tian? Is he the son of some superpower?” The sect masters sat there, discussing and speculating about Luo Tian’s identity.

“Roar…” A thunderous roar echoed across the Eastern Peace Continent, making its people startled. Their eyes turned to the sky.

A golden dragon appeared in their view. On it stood Sha Cangmang and other Blue Dragon Sect elders, descending from the sky.

“Respectful greetings to Master Sha!” The sect masters bowed respectfully to Sha Cangmang, their faces showing reverence. When they saw that Master Sha had ascended to Nine-source, their minds were stunned with disbelief.

“Nine-source! Is the Blue Dragon Sect about to unify the Four Sacred Starfields? Master Sha has ascended to Nine-source!” Their minds were shocked, already thinking about how to cultivate relations with Master Sha.

“Roar…” As people were still stunned by Master Sha’s Nine-source achievement, a thunderous tiger roar echoed, drawing their attention to the sky. A white tiger appeared from the void.

Jin Yongsi sat on the white tiger, smiling as he surveyed the crowd. He then approached Master Sha.

“Master Jin, what’s going on? Why have you regressed to Seven-source?” People looked at Jin Yongsi with confusion.

“Burning origin!” A Seven-source Supreme Lord noticed the condition of Jin Yongsi’s body and spoke softly, leaving people puzzled. What kind of person could force Jin Yongsi to burn his origin?

At the same time, Ko Zhen Tian appeared with a grim face. The entire Vermilion Bird Sect’s strength stood outside the Eastern Peace Continent, blocking all directions.

“Old Ko, why is your face so grim?” Jin Yongsi smiled and addressed Ko Zhen Tian.

“You know perfectly well. I don’t believe you haven’t heard the news. Wait and see if this boy’s Heavenly Yuan Sect can last long!” Ko Zhen Tian’s face bore a fierce expression, his eyes gazing toward the depths of Heavenly Yuan Mountain.

“Old Ko, let’s be merciful. Why are you doing this?” Chen Xuanning’s voice echoed from the void, and with him came an even older elder.

The elder looked as if he had reached his end, appearing listless. His eyelids were lined with wrinkles, and his forehead and face bore patches of age spots.

“Master Black Tortoise!” Jin Yongsi and Ko Zhen Tian bowed respectfully to the elder, as did Master Sha. They all approached him.

“Alright, I just came to watch the spectacle. You all go ahead. But I advise you not to overdo it; I can sense the coming of chaos. Don’t excessively drain the Four Sacred Starfields’ strength. I seem to see a Supreme Lord’s bloodshed, and it’s Nine-source. Even if one is in the transcendental realm, they might not survive with carelessness!” The elder opened his eyes, which were chaotic and full of brilliance. His gaze fell upon Jiang Sizhi and Luo Tian approaching from the distance.

Upon hearing Master Black Tortoise’s words, Master Sha and others slightly changed their expressions. As a legendary beast, Master Black Tortoise had lived so long he could foresee certain things. His words now made Master Sha and others take it seriously.

“Hiss…” A series of gasps echoed. People looked at the figures standing in the sky who could dominate the Four Sacred Starfields, marveling at how large a favor Luo Tian had received to invite them all.

“This boy might save the Four Sacred Starfields one day. So… you can test him, but don’t have any murderous intent toward him. Otherwise, the regret will be yours alone,” Master Black Tortoise said lazily. As the oldest being in the Four Sacred Starfields, he naturally didn’t want it to be destroyed, so he spoke these words to the three.

“Yes, three of you. For the future of the Four Sacred Starfields…”

“Impossible!” Chen Xuanning had intended to persuade them further, but the next moment, Master Sha, Jin Yongsi, and Ko Zhen Tian all spoke in unison to interrupt him.

They had never allowed anyone to walk all over them for so many years. Now, Luo Tian repeatedly insulted their three sects, causing heavy losses. How could they let go of Luo Tian?

“Alas…” Chen Xuanning knew his words were in vain. These three had been at the top of the Four Sacred Starfields for years and couldn’t tolerate being pushed around without a word.

“Master Ko has also ascended to Nine-source! Is this the only surviving legendary beast, Master Black Tortoise? I didn’t expect even he would come!” People’s faces were shocked as they bowed to Master Sha and others.

At the same time, Jiang Sizhi and Luo Tian arrived with their group from a distance. A sense of authority radiated from Jiang Sizhi, making people’s eyes brighten.

“Seven-source! This Jiang Sizhi has reached the Seven-source Supreme Lord level!”

“Even more astonishing is Luo Tian. He’s already at Eight-source! I remember after the last ranking battle, it wasn’t long before this boy returned to the Blue Dragon Sect. What kind of world-altering elixir did he eat?” People felt Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi’s cultivation levels again, exclaiming loudly.

“Welcome all of you to my Heavenly Yuan Sect’s founding ceremony. No matter your reasons, we welcome you wholeheartedly!” Jiang Sizhi stood before Master Sha and others, her face showing respect.

“Sizhi, you were my Blue Dragon Sect’s prodigy. Because I bound you with the divine-binding belt, today you’ve defected to Luo Tian?” Master Sha spoke, his eyes carrying a touch of melancholy.

Jiang Sizhi, this celestial beauty, was surely the target of every sect. He had intended to kill Luo Tian and restore Jiang Sizhi’s status, but instead, he unintentionally helped Luo Tian.

“Sorry, Master Sha. Now Luo Tian is my husband. So stop saying such meaningless things!” Jiang Sizhi spoke, her eyes showing coldness toward Master Sha.

In Jiang Sizhi’s view, Luo Tian and she had never owed the Blue Dragon Sect anything. On the contrary, they had brought great benefits to it. Two ranking battles, they led the Blue Dragon Sect to two first places. Such great achievements, yet the Blue Dragon Sect treated Luo Tian this way, causing Jiang Sizhi to be deeply indignant.

“Jiang Sizhi, I ask you: did you kill my Vermilion Bird Sect’s Ko Xinshui and Ko Xindie siblings?” Ko Zhen Tian gazed at Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi, speaking solemnly.

“Guess Master Ko already knows the answer. My answer is also what you expect!” Jiang Sizhi smiled at Ko Zhen Tian.

“Haha, kid, today no one can save you!” Jin Yongsi didn’t speak to Jiang Sizhi but skipped her, directing his gaze toward Luo Tian.

Ignoring Jin Yongsi’s provocation, Luo Tian spoke coldly: “All sect masters, today is my Blue Dragon Sect’s founding day. If you’ve come to congratulate us, we welcome it. If you want trouble, wait until after our founding ceremony to settle it. Of course, if anyone is unwise and wants to cause trouble during our ceremony, I won’t mind finishing the matter afterward and visiting your sects.”

Hearing Master Sha’s and Luo Tian’s words, the onlookers below were stunned.

“Damn it! It wasn’t Luo Tian’s favor that brought the Four Major Sects here. They came to trouble Luo Tian!” People whispered, looking at each other and gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

The followers who had returned with Luo Tian also wore complex expressions. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to offend three of the Four Major Sects so thoroughly. Some people began regretting following Luo Tian.

Originally, they thought that with Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi’s talent, they could become the Fifth Major Power of the Four Sacred Starfields. But now it seemed they had overestimated, as they chose to clash head-on with the Four Major Sects before growing strong. This made them fear greatly.

Jiang Sizhi also had sweat on her palms, but she maintained a calm smile as she gazed at Master Sha and the others.

“What are you? Do you think you can establish a sect in the Four Sacred Starfields without our approval?” At this moment, a playful voice echoed in people’s ears, causing Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi to slightly frown.

Chapter 806: Who Else Disagrees?

On the Eastern Peace Continent, Master Sha, Jin Yongsi, and Ko Zhen Tian wore cold expressions as they gazed at Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi. The atmosphere in the sky was delicate.

“What are you? Do you think you can establish a sect in the Four Sacred Starfields without our approval?” As the atmosphere in the sky gradually solidified, a playful voice echoed from the ground.

Then several more voices joined in the crowd, causing the Heavenly Yuan Sect’s people to wear cold expressions.

Some others remained neutral, not speaking a word and watching the spectacle with interest.

Luo Tian was an Eight-source Supreme Lord. Besides the Four Major Sects, only a few powerful sects dared to provoke him.

“Qinghong Prefecture… Longya Pavilion… Baimei Hall…” One by one, the names of sects were spoken.

These sects had no doubt been closely tied to the Blue Dragon Sect, Vermilion Bird Sect, and White Tiger Sect. They also had Seven-source or Eight-source Supreme Lords as their masters.

Luo Tian’s gaze swept over these people, a smile forming on his face. His expression carried endless coldness.

Master Sha also wore a smile, but due to the blood oath, he would not attack Luo Tian or his forces within this year. However, it didn’t mean others couldn’t.

Jin Yongsi and Ko Zhen Tian also had their reservations. Last time, they had failed to capture Luo Tian, and now Jin Yongsi’s strength hadn’t recovered yet. Ko Zhen Tian alone couldn’t hold Luo Tian back. If they fought together in front of everyone, and Luo Tian still escaped, their sects’ faces and prestige would be ruined.

“You guys are dogs. You bark so loudly!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, like a gust of wind that swept through their hearts.

“Hmph. Are you the sect master of Heavenly Yuan Sect? That woman isn’t the sect master either. If she can beat us, we’ll agree to let you establish your sect!” A bearded man shouted, his face showing mockery as he gazed at Jiang Sizhi.

“Qinghong Prefecture’s Teng Changhong?” Jiang Yimeng whispered to Luo Tian and Jiang Sizhi, revealing the man’s identity.

“Since Teng Sect Master has such enthusiasm, I’ll take this opportunity to test your strength!” Jiang Sizhi’s face bore killing intent. She had known creating a sect would not be easy, and now seeing someone step forward, she intended to strike fear into others.

“Haha… Jiang Sizhi truly is a traitor of the Blue Dragon Sect. I admire your courage!” Teng Changhong laughed, surrounding his body with seven sources of origin. His eyes showed contempt as he soared into the sky, instantly enveloping the entire Heavenly Yuan Mountain with his Seven-source Supreme Lord’s aura. The sect members felt their breaths catch.

Jiang Sizhi observed Teng Changhong’s origin sources, her face showing disdain. Though Teng was a Seven-source Supreme Lord, only two of his seven sources were great origin sources. The remaining five were attribute origins—far inferior to her.

With a step forward, wind surged around her. She stepped into the void and slowly approached Teng Changhong.

But just as Jiang Sizhi took a step, a playful voice echoed into people’s ears: “Master, this kind of person isn’t worthy of your killing. I can finish him in a moment!”

Jiang Sizhi furrowed her brows, turning to gaze at Luo Tian. She could certainly defeat Teng Changhong herself; why would she let Luo Tian intervene?

“With your pregnancy, you should focus on nurturing the child. Let me handle this fighting!” Luo Tian slowly stepped in front of Jiang Sizhi, his voice echoing into her mind.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Jiang Sizhi was stunned. Turning to gaze at his eyes, she saw a gentle expression. She hadn’t expected that despite her efforts to hide it, Luo Tian had still discovered.

Since many people were around, Luo Tian didn’t act too boldly. Instead, he bowed respectfully like a disciple to Jiang Sizhi and blinked his eyes.

Jiang Sizhi had tried her best to hide it, but Luo Tian was so powerful he could sense the tiny life within her body.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected that just one night had made him a father. He was somewhat speechless, his genes truly powerful.

“Grandpa and dad and mom will be very happy!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He stepped in front of Teng Changhong, his eyes turning cold.

“Luo Tian, I challenged the sect master of Heavenly Yuan Sect. You aren’t even the sect master! Why did you come out?” Teng Changhong was somewhat flustered. After all, Luo Tian was an Eight-source Supreme Lord while he was only a Seven-source. His heart wavered.

“Smack!” But Luo Tian didn’t bother to explain to Teng Changhong. His figure appeared before Teng Changhong like a ghost, his hand swinging and slapping Teng’s bearded face.

In an instant, Teng Changhong flew like a meteor toward the distance. As he was about to crash into a mountain, Luo Tian’s figure appeared before him again. His hand swung once more, sending Teng back to the crowd.

Luo Tian followed him like a shadow. He grabbed Teng’s robe, smiling: “What are you? Your master dares not even speak, yet you dare to shout here. Today I’ll kill you and see what your master can do!”

Luo Tian didn’t directly annihilate Teng. Instead, he repeatedly slapped him across the face.

Though Teng was a Seven-source Supreme Lord, he was far inferior to Luo Tian. Cracking sounds echoed from his head continuously, bloodied teeth falling from the sky.

“Smack… Smack…” The people below stared in shock, gazing at Luo Tian in the sky. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so powerful that a Seven-source Supreme Lord could not resist.

Jin Yongsi remained silent. His strength was also Seven-source; if he faced Luo Tian, he wouldn’t be as unfortunate as Teng Changhong but would still not match Luo Tian.

Ko Zhen Tian’s brows slightly furrowed. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to recover so quickly and for his strength to seem even more refined, solidified than when he had left the Divine Realm.

“Luo Tian, be merciful!” Chen Xuanning’s face showed a touch of pity as he watched Teng Changhong, whose head had grown larger and was cracked with lines. He loudly advised.

Chen Xuanning also marveled at how Luo Tian now was no less than himself, even slightly stronger.

Hearing Chen Xuanning’s words, the old tortoise, who had been lazy and eyes half-closed, slightly twitched his lips.

“Smack!” As Chen Xuanning’s words finished, it was unclear whether Teng Changhong’s body was too weak or Luo Tian had used too much strength. Teng’s head exploded entirely, three soul fragments flying out of his body.

“Truly not tough!” Luo Tian muttered softly. Green flames flew from his hands, enveloping the three soul fragments. Under the emerald crystal fire, Teng’s three soul fragments turned into wisps of smoke, vanishing from people’s sight.

A headless body fell from the sky onto the stone ground, staining it red with blood. People were shocked.

“Come on, take this body and throw it to the back mountain to feed the dogs!” Luo Tian ordered the stunned Heavenly Yuan Sect disciples.

Startled by Luo Tian’s voice, the disciples trembled and carried Teng Changhong’s body out.

“Is there anyone else?” Luo Tian turned his gaze to a middle-aged man who had shouted loudly before. His figure vanished into the sky, appearing like a green eagle before the man. He extended his hand, forming a powerful hawk’s claw and grabbing the man into the sky.

People stared in awe at Luo Tian, who radiated overwhelming power. They thought to themselves: “Damn it! That was a Seven-source Supreme Lord, and he was killed like that!”

“What do you have to say? Come on, speak up. Let me hear what you don’t like about our beloved sect master!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold light, his voice echoing through the heavens and making all attending sect masters tremble slightly.

“Demon!” People thought of only one word to describe Luo Tian, remaining silent. As for the other sect masters who had followed Teng Changhong before, they slightly lifted their legs and retreated into the crowd. They didn’t want to stay in the Heavenly Yuan Sect any longer.

But as they had taken a few steps, they stopped. They felt a terrifying killing intent locking onto them. If they took another step back, they would face a storm of attacks.

The middle-aged man held by Luo Tian trembled. He gazed at Ko Zhen Tian, but received only Ko Zhen Tian’s silence.
