Time is needed, do you understand? We can only try our best. These few days, we'll study it; if we manage to create these ten-grade elixirs, there will be a chance!" Jiang Yuexiong spoke.

"Time is running out," Luo Tian said, sighing deeply in his heart. His eyes flashed with coldness. He must find the traitor, otherwise, the Wheel Rotation Temple would be too dangerous.

"Recovery Elixir!"

"This elixir, if completed, is truly worth a life!" When it came to elixirs, Jiang Yuexiong's eyes shone with fanaticism.

"Good! We'll just have to try!" Luo Tian nodded. The three of them started studying the formula.

Time passed slowly, seven days had gone by. Du Jianxing and others waited anxiously, but Luo Tian and the two others seemed to vanish without a trace. People outside the hall often heard arguments.

Another seven days passed, but Luo Tian and his companions still had no news. This made Du Jianxing and others even more anxious.

"What's going on?"

"It's been half a month, no news at all. We should inform them so we can find another way!" Some elders dared not disturb, but could only watch helplessly.

Another seven days passed. Three loud laughs echoed through the hall, and a wave of intense heat burst out from it, making people outside the hall look at each other with joy.

"This must be the beginning of refining elixirs. I've seen people from the Immortal World refine them before!" The group discussed, but just as they were excited, there was no more movement in the hall.

"This is really trying to kill us! In a few days, the Grand Master will be dead!" Huo Zunzhe's hot-tempered nature made him unable to sit still.

"Wait, we must trust Luo Tian. Do you have any better ideas?" Du Jianxing's eyes were serious.

In the anxious waiting, another seven days passed. The people could no longer wait.

Buzz...

Just as they were about to rush into the hall, a tremendous wave of power burst out from the Wheel Rotation Temple. It generated an oppressive pressure that made Du Jianxing and others look at each other in disbelief.

"What on earth is happening!" The people cried out, eyes filled with disbelief. Even they were Immortal Kings and felt this oppressive pressure, especially those closest to it.

Time passed. A whole day had gone by, and the oppressive pressure grew stronger. The sky changed, and during this day, thunder never stopped. Endless darkness descended, but the Wheel Rotation Temple and its surrounding area of ten thousand miles were like day, shrouded in apocalyptic thunder.

At midnight, a resounding explosion echoed from the Wheel Rotation Temple. A streak of light cut through the sky, and the earth trembled. The entire Wheel Rotation Temple and its surrounding area of ten thousand miles shook, as if the sky itself would collapse.

"Haha! It's done!" A loud laugh echoed from within the hall. The door of the hall was shattered by a gust of wind, revealing three exhausted figures.

"Although it's just an initial form, it is still sufficient for use!" Luo Tian lay on the ground, his body blackened and charred like a beggar, but his face was filled with joy.

"Grand Master can be saved?" A murmur spread among the people, who could clearly feel Luo Tian's weakened aura.

Chapter 2788: Journey to the Ghost Swamp

"Mission accomplished!" Luo Tian spoke softly, looking at Hei Bai and Bai Chang who lay there. At this moment, the aura of Hei Bai and Bai Chang had stabilized.

"Did it work?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the people of the Wheel Rotation Temple looked at each other with excitement and turned their eyes to Hei Bai and Bai Chang, as if they couldn't believe it.

"It really worked!" The people carefully observed Hei Bai and Bai Chang's condition, feeling their state. Everyone gasped in surprise.

"It needs to be cultivated; there might even be unexpected gains!" Luo Tian spoke to the people. How could ten-grade elixirs not be extraordinary?

Luo Tian recalled his experiences over the past month, as if it were a dream. He felt even more respect for Jiang Yuexiong. Now, Luo Tian was confident he could refine nine-grade elixirs. This ten-grade elixir had been created by the three of them together; without any one of them, it might have failed.

However, Luo Tian and Jiang Yuexiong felt that this was merely the initial form of a ten-grade elixir, not yet considered an actual ten-grade elixir. Even so, it was enough to save Hei Bai and Bai Chang. Luo Tian felt that once Hei Bai and Bai Chang fully refined this elixir, their cultivation might even improve further. Everything would depend on Hei Bai and Bai Chang's fortune.

"Master, you've truly humbled me!" Luo Tian quickly helped Du Jianxing up. How could he let Du Jianxing bow?

But just as Luo Tian had helped Du Jianxing up, a beam of divine light suddenly rose behind Du Jianxing and shot toward Luo Tian's pale face.

This attack was a one-shot kill. It was almost impossible to escape, and the opponent had even shown signs of burning their cultivation and essence. Even an Immortal King at the late stage would be unable to escape.

At this moment, Luo Tian's weakened appearance did not look like that of an Immortal King at the late stage. He definitely couldn't withstand it.

"Who!" Almost instantly, everyone shouted in anger and looked toward the direction of the disturbance. However, it was empty because people's attention had been on Luo Tian.

"Stop it!" People could only pray silently that Luo Tian would be able to withstand the attack. At this moment, no one could do anything.

Luo Tian was slightly surprised but not panicked. His aura suddenly burst out, dispelling his previous weakness. He reached out and grabbed the disturbance that had flown toward him.

"Never expected it to be you!" Luo Tian clenched his fist, and the disturbance disappeared. He sighed deeply and flicked his finger, sending a streak of light from his fingertip. The direction of the streak was toward Jueying Tianzun, who stood beside Du Jianxing.

"You!" Jueying Tianzun's face turned pale. He had no time to resist and could only say one word before his throat was pierced by the streak of light.

"Did you really think I would be so weak?" Luo Tian smiled lightly. There was no sign of his previous weakness.

"Jueying!" Everyone's eyes turned to Jueying Tianzun, who was still standing there. They were stunned.

Clang... A black needle fell to the ground, bringing people back to their senses. Their eyes turned toward Luo Tian.

Although people had some suspicions, they could not believe that Jueying Tianzun was the one who had just attacked Luo Tian.

"I really don't understand. Did the Wheel Rotation Temple not treat you well? Why did you side with Luoshengmen!" Luo Tian stepped toward Jueying Tianzun.

Luo Tian's previous weakened appearance was entirely an act to try and lure out the traitor. He hadn't expected it to actually work, but he hadn't anticipated that it would be Jueying Tianzun.

Luo Tian knew a little about Jueying Tianzun and had thought he was not the traitor. However, why Jueying Tianzun was a traitor, Luo Tian could no longer ask because Jueying Tianzun's entire body had started to turn black and eventually turned into a pile of black ash, dispersing from people's sight.

"Unexpectedly, Jueying Tianzun was the traitor planted by Luoshengmen in our Wheel Rotation Temple. Why?" People sighed lowly, curious.

"Thank you both for your help this time!" Luo Tian's face showed gratitude and didn't think much more, addressing Jiang Yuexiong and Run Hongyu.

"It's an honor to witness the emergence of a ten-grade elixir!" Run Hongyu laughed.

"Kid, don't be in such a hurry. I'll go back and study it again to try and create the complete ten-grade elixir. This time, I really didn't come in vain!" Jiang Yuexiong was even more excited. Without Luo Tian, he wouldn't have been able to achieve this so quickly.

"Okay, Master. I'll leave it in your hands. I need to go to the Ghost Swamp!" Luo Tian said to Du Jianxing.

"Be careful," Du Jianxing nodded. At this point, Luo Tian was no longer the same as before; his strength had surpassed Du Jianxing's.

Luo Tian and the others stayed in the Wheel Rotation Temple for a few more days. When they saw that Hei Bai and Bai Chang's aura was even more stable, they left.

Run Hongyu and Jiang Yuexiong returned to Tianyuan Sect. Luo Tian, however, flew toward the Ghost Swamp. But he took two people with him: Da Niu and Er Niu, two strong figures who had been with Luo Tian since his time in the Shenyi Village. They had remained at the Wheel Rotation Temple.

Luo Tian took them with him because they hadn't been home for a long time, and he also planned to take them back.

After flying for three days, Luo Tian and his two companions reached the outer edge of the Ghost Swamp. They looked at the swamp shrouded in mist, their eyes filled with apprehension.

Although Luo Tian was now an Immortal King at the peak stage, he still felt wary of the Ghost Swamp.

"Let's go. I suppose it might take a long time before we come out!" Luo Tian said to Da Niu and Er Niu. He planned to go deep into the Shenyi Village to see if there were any opportunities.

"Okay!"

"I really miss the village head!" Da Niu and Er Niu's eyes were filled with excitement. The outside world was good, but nothing compared to home.

Luo Tian led the way at the front. Da Niu and Er Niu followed behind him, and the three of them stepped into the Ghost Swamp.

After flying for a quarter of an hour, a series of roaring sounds echoed beneath them. Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile.

"I'm not as weak as I used to be now!" Luo Tian raised his hand and grabbed, sending a black hand down. Several black crocodiles were smashed by Luo Tian's strike and turned into blood mist.

As the crocodiles shattered, a bloody scent spread. A series of roars rose from the swamp, and the swamp began to stir.

Chapter 2789: The Shenyi Village's Destruction

Roar... A series of roars echoed through the heavens and earth. Several giant crocodiles leaped into the air, rushing toward Luo Tian and his companions.

Luo Tian held his spear, "Rip the Sky," and a series of spear images surrounded them. The crocodiles shattered around Luo Tian's group, turning into blood mist scattered across the swamp. In an instant, the swamp was stained red.

Luo Tian walked through the sky. The giant crocodiles did not stop Luo Tian and his companions at all. Soon, Luo Tian led Da Niu and Er Niu into the depths of the Ghost Swamp.

Luo Tian didn't know how many crocodiles he had killed, his body covered in blood. Finally, a massive creature moved through the mud and appeared on Luo Tian's path.

Rippling... In an instant, a wave of blood-colored mud surged up. A thick tail swung toward Luo Tian with great force.

"Back then, you chased me so hard!" Luo Tian sneered. He raised his hand and crushed the whirlpool with a black ghost claw, reaching out toward the crocodile that was over a thousand feet long. At the same time, his other hand smashed out a punch toward that thick tail.

Boom... A heavy sound echoed from Luo Tian's front. The body over a thousand feet long was directly smashed away by Luo Tian's punch, and the black hellish ghost claw precisely grabbed onto the crocodile's body as it flew back.

Howl... A pitiful scream echoed through the heavens and earth, causing Da Niu and Er Niu's heads to ring.

"Lightning! Reincarnation! Sword Domain!" Luo Tian spoke. In an instant, the area of ten thousand feet was enveloped by Luo Tian's domain. Countless souls drifted within Luo Tian's domain, and more terrifying was that the souls moved at an extremely fast speed, like swords and lightning. Each soul radiated a terrifying aura.

After entering the peak stage of Immortal King, Luo Tian's domain had also become fully complete and reached ten thousand feet. Moreover, during this time, Luo Tian's domain had been strengthened significantly, integrating the lightning power into it.

Ten thousand souls howled. Waves of thunder and sword energy broke free from the domain, as if they were empowered by something. The entire domain became boiling.

Boom... Boom... Several crocodiles were directly hit by the thunder and sword energy, being completely annihilated under Luo Tian's domain. The thousand-foot-long crocodile also let out a roar, trying to escape but continuously colliding with the domain and being unable to break free.

"Dahei, Erhei, your food has arrived!" Luo Tian waved his hand. Two large black dogs appeared beside him. They barked and rushed toward the crocodile.

When one person reached enlightenment, even their dogs would ascend. The two large black dogs had greatly increased in strength when Luo Tian reached the peak stage of Immortal King. Dahei had entered the late stage, and Erhei had reached the middle stage.

Luo Tian only took Da Niu and Er Niu, standing there watching the two large black dogs fighting with the crocodile. If Dahei and Erhei fell behind, Luo Tian would intervene.

A pitiful roar echoed constantly. The crocodile was chased to the point of no escape by the two dogs, even when it dove into the swamp, they still chased it out. Within a quarter of an hour, Dahei and Erhei returned to Luo Tian's side with full bellies. They brought back the crocodile's body and delivered it to Luo Tian.

"You two are still greedy..." Luo Tian was a bit speechless, understanding the meaning of the two dogs. They wanted him to cook this crocodile.

"Wait, I'll cook it for you once we get out!" Luo Tian smiled and collected the crocodile's body. This crocodile was nothing to Luo Tian now.

But for those who had just entered the Immortal World, it was a precious item. It was a great nourishing food because this crocodile had already reached the late stage of Immortal King and was even stronger than that in the swamp.

After killing this crocodile king, no other crocodiles dared to approach Luo Tian. They all dove into the swamp and scattered in all directions.

Luo Tian encountered no more trouble, leading Da Niu and Er Niu along with the two large black dogs through the swamp. They stepped onto the ground filled with decay, which was where the prison of Xing Tian had been sealed.

As soon as they landed, Luo Tian built a fire and took off some of the crocodile meat. He ignited the flames to cook for his two gluttonous black dogs.

After a hearty meal, they continued forward. The things left by Xing Tian had already been refined and absorbed by Luo Tian and his companions, so there was no danger here.

"Good, this place is quite familiar!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He knew that what lay ahead was the Sea of Corpses and Ice Plains. That place had almost cost him his life before, where Xing Tian's body was taken to the Shenyi Village by five elders.

Luo Tian was especially eager for another piece of the Sword of Destruction on Xing Tian's body. He planned to take it back this time and find a way for Lu Chong to repair it. It would definitely be a powerful weapon, even more so than the world's treasures. After all, Xu Tian Dao Ren had been a god-like figure in the past.

Cold air swept over, but it was much better than when Luo Tian had come before. He quickly walked into the outer edge of the ice plains.

As soon as he stepped onto the ice plains, Luo Tian's face turned grim. He discovered that although the entire plain was still very cold, it had become a wasteland with large pieces of broken ice scattered across the ground. What surprised Luo Tian most was that the sealed corpses in the plains had all disappeared.

"What's going on? Did your five grandfathers take these corpses away?" Luo Tian asked, his voice filled with confusion.

"It's not possible. My five grandfathers aren't that idle. If they wanted to dig, they would have done it long ago!" Da Niu replied.

"Could it be..." Luo Tian's heart jolted. He thought of the people from Luoshengmen who had entered the Ghost Swamp when he left before. Some even included Huangtian's Grand Master.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian had some suspicions but didn't dare to tell Da Niu and Er Niu. He led them into the air, rushing toward the outside of the ice plains.

Throughout their journey, all the sealed corpses in the ice plains had disappeared. This made Luo Tian more cautious.

After flying for half a day, Luo Tian and Da Niu and Er Niu finally reached the former Shenyi Village. But when they stopped at the village's edge, the three of them were stunned. The Shenyi Village had become a ruin. However, the statue of Xu Tian Dao Ren still stood there. Five figures surrounded it with their bodies straight but without life.

Each of the five had received fatal injuries. Some had their heads pierced through, and others had their chests completely hollowed out. Yet they still stood there as if guarding Xu Tian Dao Ren's statue.

"Grandpa!" Da Niu and Er Niu shouted, flying toward the five statues. Tears flowed down their faces.

Chapter 2790: The Killing Platform

The five figures stood straight, but no matter how Da Niu and Er Niu called out to them, they did not respond. This made Luo Tian sigh deeply. These five elders were at their peak strength, but they had been killed here by someone. This made Luo Tian feel shocked and puzzled. Who could have such strength?

Although Huangtian's Grand Master and others were strong, these five elders had been five peaks. How could they have been killed by just Huangtian's Grand Master and a few others?

"It must be that many things have happened that I don't know about!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He looked at Xu Tian Dao Ren's statue and walked toward Da Niu and Er Niu, comforting them softly.

"Buzz..." Just as Luo Tian had approached Da Niu and Er Niu, Xu Tian Dao Ren's statue emitted waves. Its vacant eyes gradually focused.

Two golden whirlwinds appeared in Luo Tian's vision, and a powerful aura made his face change.

Luo Tian was confused. He pulled Da Niu and Er Niu back, but he suddenly realized that they seemed to be pulled by a strong pressure. They were no longer under his control.

"Come here!" Luo Tian shouted, not knowing whether the two whirlwinds in Xu Tian Dao Ren's eyes were good or bad.

Boom... At the same time, a series of booming sounds came from Da Niu and Er Niu's bodies. Their bloodline power burst forth, emitting a powerful pressure that could shake the heavens and earth. Even Luo Tian at the peak of Immortal King felt a pressure.

"Buzz..." It seemed something was pulling, and Luo Tian's blood was also stimulated as if by something. His pressure gradually disappeared, but he still couldn't pull Da Niu and Er Niu out.

"Big brother, let us go!" Da Niu spoke. He felt that this pulling force didn't harm them.

"Okay!" Luo Tian nodded and let go of Da Niu and Er Niu, allowing them to be pulled toward the massive Xu Tian Dao Ren statue. They seemed slow but instantly appeared on top of Xu Tian Dao Ren's head. They also closed their eyes and sat cross-legged in the two whirlwinds on top of their heads.

"What is this..." Luo Tian was shocked. He felt that Da Niu and Er Niu had encountered a great fortune, one that only they could bear. Only the descendants of Xu Tian Dao Ren could receive this.

Luo Tian looked at the five elders standing there, as if he had understood something. However, it was just a guess.

"Da Niu and Er Niu, I'll go in to check. You two stay here!" Luo Tian didn't know how long it would take for them to accept the inheritance, so he decided to leave first and return later to go with them. He set up a simple formation, so that if anyone came, he would sense it and return quickly.

"Where is Yin Xuanbing?" Luo Tian was most concerned about Yin Xuanbing. He was a formidable figure, and if he escaped, it would be a big enemy. Moreover, Luo Tian was still thinking about the other half of the Sword of Destruction.

Luo Tian had everything arranged. He stepped toward the back mountain of Shenyi Village. Previously, Luo Tian had only reached as far as the back mountain. After that, the five elders of Shenyi Village had warned Luo Tian and Da Niu and Er Niu not to go beyond the back mountain.

The entire back mountain had now become a flat land, and Luo Tian stepped on the broken stones as he walked out of Shenyi Village.

"What is it that even made those elders afraid?" Luo Tian was puzzled and became more cautious. This place had left him with many memories.

After stepping out of the broken stones, black mist rose again and obscured Luo Tian's vision. He stepped out of Shenyi Village's boundaries.

As soon as he stepped out, a powerful killing aura filled the heavens and earth. It made Luo Tian feel cold, and that killing aura gave him a strong sense of danger. Fortunately, Luo Tian's strength was formidable enough to withstand it. Otherwise, even an Immortal King at the middle or late stage would have had difficulty enduring that powerful killing aura for long.

Time passed. Luo Tian walked for about an hour, and the black mist and killing aura became stronger. He felt that the ground beneath his feet was getting lower, as if it were a valley. It would be hard to notice unless one looked carefully.

After another quarter of an hour, a black mountain appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

"This is..." Luo Tian activated his Lei Yang Eye and looked at the black mountain. After carefully observing, his eyes showed disbelief.

The black mountain was imposing and powerful, even making Luo Tian feel a strong pressure. What surprised Luo Tian most was that this mountain had appeared before in the Demon's Ridge of Hell, but this one was much larger and more powerful.

"Could it be the real Ghost Valley Mountain?" Luo Tian smiled slightly, looking at the strong pressure and killing aura. He walked toward the mountain.

After walking for half an hour, he reached the foot of the mountain. A wide road led directly from the base to the summit.

The black steps had bloodstains, although dried, but they contained powerful divine essence. This indicated that the person who had bled was a strong individual.

"Royal Blood!" Luo Tian exclaimed. The first step already had the blood of an Immortal King, and that powerful killing aura was also emitted from this step.

"What kind of place is this?" Luo Tian sighed softly, looking at the towering mountain.

Buzz... Just as Luo Tian was amazed, waves of energy spread from his body. This made him feel a strong shock because the waves were not coming from elsewhere but from the Book of Epochs in his mind.

Since Luo Tian had entered the Immortal World, the Book of Epochs hadn't shown such waves for a long time. He hadn't expected it to show waves now.

Moreover, not only did it produce waves but also flew out of his mind on its own, becoming a streak of light that flew toward the summit.

"Come back, big brother!" Luo Tian reached out to grab the Book of Epochs but it seemed to have forgotten its master and disappeared from his sight.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed, looking at the killing aura steps. He frowned and finally bit his lip, stepping onto the steps.

As Luo Tian stepped on the steps, a wave of energy enveloped him. The scenery around him also changed.

In an instant, the steps beneath his feet were no longer there. Instead, a bloodstained battlefield appeared. A middle-aged man held a battle knife and emitted an icy aura. Although it wasn't tangible, his presence was powerful.

"Welcome to the Killing Platform!" The man's face was cold as he spoke to Luo Tian.

Chapter 2791: Ghost Valley Mountain

"Killing Platform!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. He hadn't heard of the existence of this Killing Platform before.

The middle-aged man, whom Luo Tian could feel was not a person but an意志 of killing.

"The Killing Platform is the most brutal trial in Ghost Valley Mountain. Of course, it also contains great fortune. As long as you defeat me!" The middle-aged man didn't speak much but rushed toward Luo Tian with his battle knife.

"Killing Platform! Ghost Valley Mountain!" Luo Tian accurately caught the middle-aged man's words. His face showed shock, as the meaning of the man's words suggested that this mountain was indeed Ghost Valley Mountain.

Thinking about Guiguzi, the terrifying figure, Luo Tian's heart slightly tightened. Although Guiguzi had not appeared, there were still legends of him in the Immortal World and Hell. This was the last Emperor.

Luo Tian was shocked, but the middle-aged man also rushed toward Luo Tian. A bloodstained battle knife sliced a streak of light and slashed at Luo Tian.

Just as the battle knife was about to strike Luo Tian's head, he regained his senses and pointed his finger. The bloodstained battle knife shattered instantly.

The middle-aged man's strength was only at the early stage of Immortal King. He was too weak for Luo Tian.

Luo Tian reached out to grab the middle-aged man, hoping to get some useful information. However, in an instant, the middle-aged man shattered and turned into a cloud of blood mist that scattered around Luo Tian.

Clang... The blood mist condensed, and a red pearl fell in front of Luo Tian. This made him slightly surprised.

Luo Tian took the pearl into his hand, and a cold sensation instantly spread through his entire body. The red pearl became soft and directly slipped into Luo Tian's body through the pores on his hand.

Luo Tian immediately felt cold and couldn't help but shiver. A killing aura roamed through his entire body, trying to erode his mind.

Luo Tian's face changed slightly. The scenery around him also changed again, returning to the previous state. Luo Tian was now standing on the steps.

Sitting cross-legged, Luo Tian could clearly feel a pure force that rushed into his dantian. He quickly cultivated it, as the killing aura inside him needed to be refined; otherwise, problems would arise after a long time.

Within a short while, Luo Tian had refined the killing aura out of his body. To his surprise, his cultivation had increased slightly.

Since entering the peak stage of Immortal King, Luo Tian had felt that his cultivation was progressing very slowly. He thought he would never break through to the Emperor stage. At that time, he had realized that both Hell and the Ten Palaces of Yama had Immortal Kings at their peak. They had lived for so long but none had broken through to the Emperor stage, not even a step beyond it. There was a reason for that.

Although this increase was only slight, it was already a big surprise for Luo Tian.

"Master Bu Tian, you really didn't deceive me!" Luo Tian's eyes were filled with excitement. After a brief moment of excitement, he looked at the steps with caution. He couldn't see the end.

"Go down first!" Luo Tian thought of a plan but found that his feet were stuck as if by something, making it impossible to step down. However, he could easily lift his feet upward.

"What...?"

"Only going up is allowed, not down!" Luo Tian was speechless. He had originally planned to take a shortcut and see if he could go down the steps again, then fight that middle-aged man again to improve his cultivation. But his wish was unfulfilled.

"Let's go up another level. It shouldn't be too bad!" Luo Tian stepped forward and took a step onto the second level.

The scene changed again. A bloodstained battlefield appeared once more, and this time a different person had taken the place of the previous one. However, Luo Tian felt a pressure. His aura was suppressed, and his cultivation was reduced to the early stage of Immortal King.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed. The figure formed by the killing aura had already rushed toward him.

Luo Tian was no longer careless this time. He felt like he had boarded a ship and could not turn back. He could clearly feel that the force suppressing his strength was something he had refined before, and it seemed to be stronger than his world power.

"Is this the strength cultivated by an Emperor?" Luo Tian was puzzled, but he had no time to think. He took up his spear and held it in front of him, precisely blocking the sharp sword's slash.

Luo Tian took two steps back. His spear bent slightly, as if it had pushed the middle-aged man holding the sword away.

Although Luo Tian's strength was reduced, his combat experience and willpower were still there. He could easily deal with an ordinary Immortal King at the early stage.

"You've got some moves!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. He actively rushed toward the figure formed by the killing aura.

After a quarter of an hour, a red pearl fell to the ground. This made Luo Tian hesitate; should he pick it up or not?

"Pick it up!" After thinking for a while, Luo Tian raised his hand and picked up the red pearl. He activated his cultivation method to refine it, which increased his strength slightly.

"Next level!" Luo Tian stepped forward again and took a step onto the one hundred twenty-sixth level.

At the summit of the black mountain, a black shadow sat there. In front of him was a chessboard and he held a golden book in his hand, smiling.

"Good..." The old man spoke softly. He picked up a chess piece from the board and looked at the Book of Epochs, beginning to place it.

If Luo Tian saw this old man's shadow, he would be shocked. This old man was none other than Guiguzi, the one he had seen a shadow of before. However, this time, Guiguzi was not in his real form but a shadow. Even so, the shadow could influence an entire world.

"This game has been going on for so long. It's finally time to finish it!" Guiguzi sighed and continued flipping through the Book of Epochs.

One year... Two years...

Ten years passed. Luo Tian was immersed in battle every day. He had fought at the early stage of Immortal King, then the middle and late stages. Each time he stepped onto a level, his opponent was different. If it were anyone else, their willpower would definitely not be able to keep up.

Chapter 2792: Stability

The Immortal World and Hell briefly fell into a calm. Although there were no major battles, small conflicts continued. Luoshengmen had withdrawn their fangs and monopolized three Wheel Rotation Temples and six Hell domains.

In the Central Three Realms, after Tianyuan Sect occupied it, it was completely stabilized. People were surprised to find that after the collision of small worlds with the Immortal World, the rules had changed. Even peak Immortal Kings could enter the Central Three Realms without any peak Immortal King coming to attack Tianyuan Sect. This was because of Luo Tian.

In the Upper Three Realms, various Immortal Mountains were developing secretly. The entire world fell into a brief peace. However, everyone knew it was just the calm before the storm. Luoshengmen, the Ten Palaces of Yama, Nine Immortal Mountains, and even Tianyuan Sect, four powerful forces would inevitably have a battle. These four forces were complex and seemed to be gathering strength.

One year... Ten years...

Time flowed like water. Thirty years had passed, which was long for ordinary people. Many had forgotten the chaos in Hell and the Immortal World thirty years ago.

In both regions, there was a brief order. The Central Three Realms changed rapidly over thirty years. People who had come from the Nine Domains grew significantly, with many entering the True Immortal Stage. Some people with extraordinary talent had entered the half-step Immortal King stage through Tianyuan Sect's vast resources.

Now, Tianyuan Sect had stronger combat power in the True Immortal Stage and the Immortal King Stage than any two major Immortal Mountains or Yama's Palace. The only regret was that there were no peak Immortal Kings.

In the grand hall of Tianyuan Sect, many high-ranking officials sat there. They had been busy for a long time due to the rapid development of Tianyuan Sect.

"My god, I can finally rest!" The people spoke and laughed, enjoying a rare break.

"Yes, Master, you should also take some time to rest!" Diao Dezhu spoke, looking at Jiang Nanxuan who sat there. Jiang Nanxuan had been the most exhausted during this time, and people could clearly see that his white hair had increased.

"Yes, it's time to rest. But don't be careless; we might have chaos at any moment. We must hold on!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, a smile on his face. For many years, the situation in Tianyuan Sect and even the Immortal World had developed according to his plan. How could he not be happy?

"Training troops, enhancing strength—this is the most important!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke.

Unfortunately, there was no news from Luo Tian. If it weren't for the ability of Btian Stone and Long Jie to sense, they would have thought Luo Tian had met with an accident!

...

In the Immortal World, on Mount Yongsheng, in the Hall of Eternal Life.

A massive eternal flower floated at the center of the grand hall. The Eternal King sat cross-legged on it, his aura radiating power.

Under the eternal flower, several Immortal Kings sat cross-legged and continuously channeled their cultivation into it. Their eyes were filled with madness, looking at the Eternal King.

"Ten thousand years have passed. My family has served the eternal flower and absorbed the blood of millions to make it fully mature. Please lead our family, Eternal!" An old man at the late stage of Immortal King spoke.
