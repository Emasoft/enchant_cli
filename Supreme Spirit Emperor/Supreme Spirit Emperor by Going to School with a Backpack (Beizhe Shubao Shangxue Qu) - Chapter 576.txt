But the youth knew that if he attacked Luo Tian, with Wang Gang's previous demeanor, he would definitely block it. If he didn't attack, Luo Tian could recover some strength at any time, and they would surely lose.

This was the Ten Palace Grand Competition. Although their Fungu Palace had inevitably become first or second, they didn't want the Holy Son to be embarrassed and also had the right of priority to choose hell.

“
Buzz…” As Long Kong was hesitating, two beams of divine light rose up. Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes and stood up.

“Luo Chen has gotten back up again, how much strength has he recovered?” Seeing Luo Tian standing up, people immediately started to murmur.

“
He must be able to fight again. His recovery ability is just too abnormal!”

“This means Fungu Palace is finished! This Grand Competition really was unpredictable until the end!” People's faces were filled with admiration.

“
Luo Senior Brother, your strength is magnificent!” The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Palace shouted loudly. All the disciples' eyes were filled with excitement. At this moment, Luo Tian was their god.

“
Count on you!” Wang Gang panted heavily, his eyes looking at Luo Tian. This time it was him who sat cross-legged, his face turning red and pale alternately.

“
You've worked hard!” Luo Tian nodded, his eyes looking at Long Kong's grim face, a slight smile appearing in his eyes.

“
Surrender. You have no chance left!” Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying a slight exhaustion. This battle had taken too long.

“
I don't believe you've fully recovered. I want to see how much strength you still have!” Long Kong's face was grim, but he still spoke. His eyes looked at Luo Tian, and a black hand descended from the sky towards Luo Tian.

“
I don't have much strength, but what about you? How much do you have?” Luo Tian chuckled lightly. His hands moved swiftly, and a black vortex appeared in the sky. The Hellish Ghost Claws collided with that black hand.

The thunderous sound shook, and waves of black energy rained down from the sky. Luo Tian's body flickered and disappeared from his original spot.

“
Damn it!” Long Kong's face slightly changed, losing Luo Tian's presence immediately. His spiritual sense was released but couldn't find him.

“
Here!” Luo Tian appeared behind Long Kong. The Dragon's Abyss Sword erupted, and it struck the back of the youth fiercely.

“
Puk…!” Blood spewed from the youth's mouth. Long Kong had already fought with Wang Gang, and he was damaged and exhausted. Now, being struck by Luo Tian's sword, he had no ability to fight back.

After knocking Long Kong away, Luo Tian turned his gaze towards the battlefield of Mo Tian and Bai Ming. He saw a black coffin shatter in front of him, and Mo Tian's body was knocked to the ground by Bai Ming's palm.

“
Cough, cough. You still fell short in the end. If both your eyes were there, we might have continued!” Bai Ming coughed lightly, his white eyes looking at Mo Tian.

“
Now it's time to see him!” Bai Ming chuckled lightly, his eyes looking at Luo Tian who was walking towards him.

“
You won't be disappointed!” Mo Tian, seeing Luo Tian approaching, smiled and spoke to Bai Ming.

To have Bai Ming dragged into such a situation and made him so reckless was enough to show Mo Tian's strength.

“
Buzz…” Luo Tian walked slowly, but in the next moment, his figure disappeared, leaving a residual image and moving towards Bai Ming.

“
Speed is useless against me!” Bai Ming chuckled lightly, taking a step forward. At the moment Bai Ming took his step, a black sword cut down along Bai Ming's body, barely avoiding it.

“
Interesting eyes!” Luo Tian's figure appeared dozens of feet away from Bai Ming, his eyes looking at Bai Ming.

“You are indeed strong. Even your true immortal power exceeds Ye Qiu, and you have eight wide meridians, which is beyond ordinary people!” Bai Ming spoke softly, his voice carrying a sigh. At this moment, only he and Luo Tian remained on the battlefield, and his condition was much worse than Luo Tian's.

Chapter 2191: The End of Harvest ()

Bai Ming spoke, his eyes watching Luo Tian and detailing his situation. This made Luo Tian's eyes show a look of surprise.

“
My current strength is only ten percent, so I can only launch one attack. If you can withstand it, then you win; if not, I win!” Bai Ming spoke, his voice carrying a touch of decisiveness.

As he spoke, Bai Ming's attack was already launched. His white eyes looked at Luo Tian, and his hands moved rapidly, sending out a series of strange imprints. These imprints transformed into thousands of black crows flying towards Luo Tian.

“
Caw, caw…” Thousands upon thousands of crows darkened the sky. At this moment, Luo Tian was staring directly into Bai Ming's white eyes, and his body slightly paused.

At the moment he met Bai Ming's eyes, Bai Ming's body changed. He seemed like a terrifying demon, radiating powerful pressure that made Luo Tian breathe heavily.

In an instant, Luo Tian felt himself entering another world. The world was dark and gloomy, Bai Ming transformed into a terrifying ghost towering over him, while he felt incredibly small. Black crows circled above his head, screeching with a hoarse voice.

A wave of fear immediately swept over Luo Tian's mind. For some reason, this fear was magnified infinitely in this world and eroded Luo Tian's mind.

“
Buzz…” In the next moment, the demon extended a large hand and grabbed Luo Tian. Sharp claws pierced into Luo Tian's body, cold energy spread throughout his entire body, making him even more terrified.

“
Illusion!” When Luo Tian realized it, he found himself powerless. The cold claws seemed to be siphoning his life force and cultivation.

“
What is that?” The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Palace were shocked, watching Luo Tian standing still in the barrier.

At this moment, a vast area around Bai Ming was filled with runes. Black crows swirled around Bai Ming, and a black long dragon connected Luo Tian and Bai Ming.

The black long dragon had flowing light within it, and this flow was life force and vitality. As the life force and vitality flowed to Bai Ming's body, his pale face gradually improved.

“
He is absorbing Luo Tian's life force and vitality!”

“
It's Bai Ming's End of Harvest!” Ye Qiu had been watching the two. After he surrendered, he was also recovering. Now he had recovered some strength.

“
The one who is caught in the illusion will be placed into another world of doom. The one who casts it will draw out the opponent's life force and vitality to supply himself!” Ye Qiu said with admiration. He had only seen Bai Ming use End of Harvest once before, and that was when Bai Ming was in the middle stage of True Immortal. He had directly killed a True Immortal at the end stage.

“
Get out…!” Luo Tian growled, trying to break free from that death-like hand. But his body was powerless.

“
I must break this illusion. Since it's born from the mind, as long as I stay calm and am not deceived by things I don't see or fear that is stirred up in my mind, I can break this illusion. This illusion's success ultimately still comes from fear!” Luo Tian calmed down, thinking to himself.

Gradually, Luo Tian stopped struggling and closed his eyes. He let the black hand grab him, with a calm expression on his face.

“
Buzz…” As Luo Tian calmed down, the sound of crows in the sky became quieter. The pressure on Luo Tian's body also decreased, and the demon's figure faded more and more.

“
Break…” After a while, a cold voice rose from Luo Tian's mouth. Luo Tian also opened his eyes.

At the moment Luo Tian opened his eyes, that world of doom shattered into fragments. His vision returned to the outside.

Back in the outside world, Luo Tian felt his cultivation and vitality flowing away. However, he quickly closed his eyes.

“
Peng peng peng…” The black crows circling above Luo Tian's head also shattered, turning into a swirling mass of dark mist that disappeared from above his head.

“
So fast!” Bai Ming's face slightly changed. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to break free from his End of Harvest illusion so quickly.

“
Again!” Bai Ming growled, his hands moving rapidly to form seals. His eyes looked at Luo Tian but found that Luo Tian was tightly closing his eyes.

“
Damn it!” Bai Ming realized he would lose. The most critical factor in casting End of Harvest was for the opponent to see his eyes, even if only for a moment.

“
Open…” Luo Tian extended his hand and grabbed the black long dragon that had pierced into his body. With both arms, he tore the black long dragon apart.

Luo Tian flew up into the air. Although his eyes were closed, he could still accurately find Bai Ming's position. The Dragon's Abyss Sword carried powerful power and slashed towards Bai Ming.

“
Surrender!” Bai Ming sighed with a bitter smile, his voice carrying a touch of resentment. Mo Tian had almost used up all his cultivation.

But the cultivation and vitality taken from Luo Tian were only enough to restore Bai Ming slightly. If Bai Ming had a little more time or cultivation, he might have turned the situation around.

Time stopped. The Dragon's Abyss Sword was at Bai Ming's back but did not strike. Luo Tian smiled at Bai Ming, also seeing Bai Ming's resentment.

But it was over. There were no "what ifs" in the world. Losing meant losing, and Luo Tian would not give him that chance to recover.

“
Wheel Rotation Palace wins!” Hearing Bai Ming's surrender, the voice of the Beast Ghost King echoed in people's ears.

As the words fell, the entire Wheel Rotation Palace was silent. People looked at the few people standing on the battlefield. Since the battle had started, three hours had passed. The length of this battle was even longer than the five teams on another battlefield.

“
Did I hear that right? Am I not dreaming?” A disciple of the Wheel Rotation Palace pinched his companion's arm.

“
I must be dreaming. I don't even feel pain!” The disciple shook his head, looking disappointed.

“
You bastard, you're pinching me!” His companion shouted back. Then his eyes were filled with excitement.

“
Boom…” A wave of deafening cheers rose instantly. The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Palace shouted loudly.

“
Holy Son, Luo Chen!” Disciples shouted one after another. Their voices were filled with excitement. No one had expected the Wheel Rotation Palace to defeat the Fungu Palace.

“
If we defeated the Fungu Palace, who else is our opponent? We will definitely be first in this Holy Son battle!”

“
There are only two battles left!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, helping up Mo Tian and Qiu Long. As for Wang Gang, he had already been moved away by the Beast Ghost King.

“
Did we not disgrace ourselves?” Qiu Long smiled bitterly. His injuries were too severe, and even though he had recovered a little, it hadn't restored him.

“
Very cool!” Luo Tian chuckled lightly. The three of them supported each other and walked back into the crowd with the cheers of the Wheel Rotation Palace disciples.

“This kid, no one can match him!” Yu Tian stood in the crowd. After this battle, his perception of Luo Tian had completely changed.

Previously, Yu Tian had wanted to kill Luo Tian, but if it weren't for Luo Tian's last-minute rescue, the Wheel Rotation Palace might have continued to be at the bottom. All of this was because of Luo Tian's last-minute rescue.

“
From today on, you are the Holy Son of my Wheel Rotation Palace!” Yu Tian smiled lightly. Having reached the stage of an Immortal King, he had seen through many things. If he insisted on killing Luo Tian, it would bring no benefit.

Compared to Yu Tian's change of heart, another enemy of Luo Tian, the Heavenly Ghost King, had a face as dark as water. The more brilliant Luo Tian was, the more trouble he would have after killing him.

However, the Heavenly Ghost King quickly had a mocking expression on his face. He watched Luo Tian being surrounded by people as he descended from the platform, because he had another plan in his heart.

“
Next battle… Yin Shen Palace vs. Huang Tian Palace!” The voice of the Beast Ghost King echoed again, announcing the next battle between two palaces.

“
Damn it, I haven't recovered yet!” Yi Jianren's face was grim. His eyes were still closed, and his soul was still weak.

“This is the key battle. Whoever wins will be in the top eight, and whoever loses might end up at the bottom!” People's faces were filled with admiration as they watched the people of Huang Tian Palace and Yin Shen Palace.

“
Come on, don't think too much. Just fight!” Fan Tianyin laughed loudly and flew up onto the battlefield.

Yi Jianren and his companions also looked grim as they landed on the battlefield. However, their aura was much weaker than Fan Tianyin's.

“
Haha, thank you, Luo Chen!” Seeing Yi Jianren’s lifeless eyes, Fan Tianyin immediately understood. He rushed over to Luo Tian and thanked him.

“
It seems Huang Tian Palace will be the last this year. Their three have suffered soul injuries! It won't be easy to recover in a short time.” People whispered among themselves. Meanwhile, the four people from both palaces had already started fighting.

The result was no surprise. It only took half an hour for the battle to end, and Huang Tian Palace's four people were knocked down on the ground by Fan Tianyin’s group.

“
You said we were trash before? Look at your current state now!” Fan Tianyin kicked Yi Jianren several times on the face, shouting at him. He almost sent Yi Jianren to reincarnation again.

But if Yi Jianren were reincarnated again, the Immortal Kings of Huang Tian Palace might not save him. After all, resurrecting someone was such a reckless act that it consumed a lot.

“
Huang Tian Palace didn't win any matches. Yin Shen Palace won one match. Fungu Palace won three matches, and Pingdeng Palace has two wins and one loss. Next is Wheel Rotation Palace vs. Pingdeng Palace!” People's faces were filled with anticipation, looking towards the Wheel Rotation Palace.

Half an hour had passed. Luo Tian and his companions' cultivation was restored, but their energy was lacking. After so many battles, they were exhausted.

“
Pingdeng Palace, surrender!” However, as the disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace were worried, Pingdeng Palace chose to surrender.

Chapter 2192: The Final Battle ()

Pingdeng Palace surrendered. It wasn't that Pingdeng Palace didn’t want to fight, but they felt the gap after Wheel Rotation Palace and Fungu Palace's battle. If they fought against Wheel Rotation Palace again, it would definitely be a bloodbath and might not even win. The final result would be mutual destruction, so it was better to preserve their strength and prepare for the next match to determine the rankings.

“
Group first!” Hearing Pingdeng Palace's surrender, people immediately turned their attention back to Wheel Rotation Palace. Four matches without a loss!

Fungu Palace was second, which meant that Fungu Palace's total score had also become second because another group, Shiluo Palace was first and surpassed Fungu Palace in the Holy Son battle's points.

“
It's clear. If we beat Shiluo Palace, we will be fifth!” The disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace became excited. Fourth place was much better than the previous tenth.

However, compared to Wheel Rotation Palace's excitement, Huang Tian Palace was deeply regretful. Because their group had no wins at all and they were severely injured. If they lost again in the last match, they would be the last place and lose the right to control another layer of hell.

“
Rest for half an hour. After that, it's the final ranking battle!” The Beast Ghost King and others said. There were still five more matches to fight, and after that, the Ten Palace Grand Competition would end.

“
What a spectacular competition!” Eight Heavenly Kings gathered together. The vice-palace masters of the ten palaces also gathered and started discussing the final battle.

“
How is Wang Gang? Can he still participate?” On the side of Wheel Rotation Palace, there was some anxiety because Wang Gang had awakened his Beast King bloodline and it hadn't disappeared yet.

“
I don’t know if we can replace him!” Fu Xingxuan frowned slightly and walked towards the eight Heavenly Kings, explaining the situation to them.

“
What? Replace him?” The Beast Ghost King and others frowned slightly. This was an unprecedented situation.

“
No, either let that Wang Gang fight or you are missing one person!” The Heavenly Ghost King Duan Zijue sneered and immediately rejected it.

“
Wang Gang has awakened his Beast King bloodline. It's a critical moment now. If we forcibly interrupt it, it would be very harmful to Wang Gang!”

“
I agree with replacing him!” The Beast Ghost King nodded. Wang Gang was his son, and even if he had to be biased a little, the ten palaces would give him this favor.

“
But replacing him might be unfair to other palaces. Other palaces have fought several matches, and although their cultivation has recovered, the mental exhaustion is inevitable!” Yuan Guiwang spoke softly. Although it had been confirmed that Wang Heng was not killed by Luo Tian, he died in the Wheel Rotation Palace. Also, it had been discovered that Wang Heng had a grudge with Luo Tian before.

Other Heavenly Kings also spoke one after another. Some agreed to replace him, and some did not. In the final vote, five people disagreed with replacing Wang Gang.

“
Don't replace him then. We three are the same!”

“
After all, we are already safely second. What's there to fear!” Luo Tian heard the news brought back by Fu Xingxuan and spoke softly, his eyes looking at Shiluo Palace's four people.

At this moment, the four people of Shiluo Palace also looked at Luo Tian and his group. Their faces were filled with battle intent.

“
Fungu Palace lost to Wheel Rotation Palace. If we defeat these people of Wheel Rotation Palace, then we will be the true first place. Previously, Fungu Palace always dominated us. This is our best chance!” Wang Xiu spoke to his three companions.

“
Yes, this time we must win first place and become the first Holy Son of Shiluo Palace!” The three companions' faces were filled with excitement. Their eyes were full of battle intent as they looked at Luo Tian and his group.

Time passed slowly. Half an hour had passed, and the eight Heavenly Kings appeared on the battlefield, their eyes looking at the disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace.

“
The final battle begins. First match, Huang Tian Palace vs. Ku Shen Palace, to determine the ninth and tenth places!” The Beast Ghost King spoke, announcing the order of matches.

“
Damn it!” Yi Jianren's face was grim. The opponent, Ku Shen Palace, was about the same level as them. But now they were not a match for Ku Shen Palace because they had fought bloodily with Fan Tianyin and suffered heavy injuries.

However, Yi Jianren's four people still gritted their teeth and stepped onto the battlefield. Their eyes looked at Ku Shen Palace's four people who were smiling coldly.

“
Alas, we have become ninth place. Huang Tian Palace has become the last!” Ku Shen Palace's Holy Son sighed, flew up and rushed towards Yi Jianren's four people.

“
We'll fight!” Yi Jianren's face was pale. His hands changed rapidly, but then his hands trembled.

“
Damn it, I still can't!” Yi Jianren's body shook. He had wanted to activate the Huang Tian Demon Seal, but his heart was trembling. He always thought of the scene where he was crushed by Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan.

“
That Yi Jianren has a trauma. He didn't use the Huang Tian Demon Seal during our previous match either, otherwise we wouldn’t have won so easily!” Fan Tianyin said with admiration, watching Yi Jianren fight against Ku Shen Palace's Holy Son.

The gap was obvious. Yi Jianren couldn't use the Huang Tian Demon Seal, and he had also been severely injured. He was completely beaten by Ku Shen Palace who were in good condition. Within a quarter of an hour, Huang Tian Palace's four people were defeated and knocked off the battlefield by Ku Shen Palace's four people.

“
Ku Shen Palace is ninth place, and Huang Tian Palace is tenth!” The Beast Ghost King spoke. This time he directly announced the rankings.

“
Alas, even though we are ninth place, it's still a保住 of hell!” Ku Shen Palace's Holy Son smiled slightly.

“
Now Huang Tian Palace is safely tenth place!” People whispered among themselves, looking at Yi Jianren who was lost in thought and then at Luo Tian.

Yi Jianren regretted deeply. He regretted provoking Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan, otherwise he wouldn't be in this situation now.

“
You can't provoke them. It's not scary to retaliate, but it is terrifying to have the strength to retaliate!” People's faces were filled with admiration as they looked at Luo Tian, who was the one who could retaliate.

Yin Shen Palace vs. Five Palaces...

Hua Palace vs. Pingdeng Palace...

Fungu Palace vs. Taiping Palace...

Time passed slowly, one palace after another fighting against each other. Fungu Palace obtained third place, and Pingdeng Palace also achieved their goal of fifth place. Finally, only Wheel Rotation Palace faced Shiluo Palace.

“
The final battle determines who is the first in this Ten Palace Grand Competition's Holy Son battle. Although the overall ranking has basically been decided, the only difference is Wheel Rotation Palace's ranking. If Wheel Rotation Palace wins first place in the Holy Son battle, then their overall ranking will be fifth. Otherwise, it would be sixth. As for Shiluo Palace, they are the biggest winner this year and have a stable first place!” People whispered among themselves, looking at Shiluo Palace's people.

“
Let's add the final touch!” Wang Xiu chuckled lightly and flew up, landing on the battlefield.

“
We should go too. After this final battle, we can rest well!” Luo Tian chuckled lightly and flew up to the battlefield.

Qiu Long and Mo Tian stood behind Luo Tian, their eyes full of battle intent. They had completely won confidence.

“
Three people?” The next moment, people were shocked, looking at the three on the battlefield. They didn't know what was going on.

“
What does it mean?"

“I understand now. Wang Gang's brother is awakening his bloodline and can't participate! Previously, the Holy Maiden went to the eight Heavenly Kings, obviously trying to replace him. If she were replaced, with the Holy Son, we would definitely have a stable first place!” The disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace discussed.

“But why can't we replace him? This situation doesn’t allow replacement, what kind of fairness is that!” The disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace immediately complained. Although they were Heavenly Kings, this was the Wheel Rotation Palace and they weren't afraid of anything.

“
Do you look down on us?"

"Or do you want to surrender directly?" Wang Xiu sneered, his eyes unkindly looking at Luo Tian's three. Luo Tian and his group dared to come up, clearly not respecting them.

“
No, we can't replace him. We have to come with three people!” Luo Tian spoke and explained.

“
Then you should surrender. You are definitely not their match!” Wang Xiu spoke coldly. If they defeated three people, it would still be somewhat disgraceful.

“
No, we want to try!” Luo Tian spoke. His eyes looked at Wang Xiu's four people.

“
You dare to look down on us!” The three faces were dark with anger and shouted at Luo Tian. Luo Tian's actions were a clear insult to them.

This was also a plan that Luo Tian had thought of on the spot. He let Mo Tian and Qiu Long attack Wang Xiu, while he faced the other three. This would increase their chances of winning.

“
Then let's see who can endure it. Is it you who can endure until the end, or me who can eliminate your two companions!” Wang Xiu's face was dark as he flew towards Mo Tian and Qiu Long.

Chapter 2193: Surrender ()

“
One against us three. Who gave you the courage to find death!” The three youths' faces were filled with coldness and anger as they shouted.

As they shouted, the three of them moved their hands rapidly. Waves of energy rose from their hands with a thunderous sound. The three had observed Luo Tian's battle before and knew that fighting with their bodies was no match for Luo Tian. They immediately launched martial arts to attack Luo Tian.

Black fists seemed to shatter the sky from another realm, appearing in Luo Tian's vision and attacking him. At the same time, two hands also slammed towards Luo Tian fiercely without giving him any chance to escape or avoid.

“
This attack can't defeat me!” Luo Tian looked at the three large hands descending from the sky and smiled. He turned his body and disappeared from his original spot. The crushing fist directly hit the ground where Luo Tian had been.

The thunderous sound echoed, and although Luo Tian dodged one of the black fists, he couldn't avoid the other two.

“
Buzz…” The sound of a dragon's roar echoed. Black sword energy flew from Luo Tian’s hand and slashed towards the other two hands.

The two hands were directly cut in half by Luo Tian, then turned into waves of energy that swept around.

“
It's not just that!” The three youths smiled coldly. Their hands moved again, sending out martial arts to attack Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, Mo Tian and Qiu Long continuously attacked Wang Xiu. Wang Xiu moved like a ghost, dodging their attacks and occasionally striking back.

“
Let's see who can endure it. If you can't endure, then you lose!” People looked with admiration and also respect at Luo Tian who was dodging and countering. If it were anyone else, they would have been crushed into dust by the three of them. But Luo Tian was only a little battered.

“This Luo Chen is indeed a promising talent!” The ten palace masters also watched Luo Tian, and they had been watching since the beginning. As palace masters, who controlled the fate of hell, they knew many secrets. They felt that Luo Tian might be something special.

“
Nonsense! Don't just because our palace has a genius, you all get jealous. No one can have any thoughts about it!” The Black and White Wusheng immediately shouted.

“
Don't get excited. We just admire this kid's talent!” Tian Yu Old Ghost smiled slightly and then changed the topic.

“
Good thing I was smart!” The Black and White Wusheng thought to themselves, smiling again. They discussed with the other palace masters.

Time passed slowly. Both Luo Tian and Wang Xiu were a little battered, but Wang Xiu's condition looked better than Luo Tian’s.

“
It's about time!” Wang Xiu moved his body and stood still, looking at the black coffin descending from the sky. He pointed his finger, sending waves of dark light that imprinted on the black coffin.

“
Peng…” In the next moment, the black ancient coffin exploded and disappeared from people's sight.

“
Good opportunity!” Qiu Long moved his body, transforming into a black mountain and slamming towards Wang Xiu.

“
No opportunity!” Wang Xiu smiled lightly, his face filled with a smile. He stood still and looked at the black mountain approaching him.

“
Crazy? You don't even run?” People were surprised to see Wang Xiu smiling foolishly and standing there.

“
Hmm?” Mo Tian stood there. His Moon Eclipse Eye erupted, looking at Wang Xiu and found no abnormalities. He was a little surprised.

But a strong figure rushed into Mo Tian's vision, making his face slightly change.

“
It's poison. Qiu Long, come back!” Mo Tian's face turned pale. He looked at Qiu Long who was rushing towards Wang Xiu and shouted.

“
What?” Qiu Long didn't hear Mo Tian's words clearly, but he stopped anyway. Because Mo Tian's Moon Eclipse Eye could see things that Qiu Long couldn't.

“
When did you get poisoned?” Mo Tian's face was grim. He immediately checked his body and carefully observed, finding that his cultivation seemed to be frozen.

“
What's wrong?” Qiu Long looked at Mo Tian with confusion. But a person's face appeared next to Qiu Long.

“
You're out!” Wang Xiu smiled and reached for Qiu Long.

Qiu Long's face slightly changed. He wanted to resist, but he found that his body had no strength and was immediately grabbed by Wang Xiu's neck.

“
What happened? Why didn't Qiu Long react at all?” The disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace looked surprised, watching the Qiu Long who was lifted up.

“
It's poison. They are poisoned!” Fu Xingxuan looked serious, watching Luo Tian and his three on the battlefield.

“
Buzz…” As people were shocked, Wang Xiu waved his hand and threw Qiu Long off the battlefield.

Qiu Long's face was grim as he fell to the ground. He looked at Wang Xiu with a fierce expression: “You bastard.”

Wang Xiu, however, seemed not to have heard Qiu Long's curse. He flew up and landed in front of Mo Tian, who was looking grim. He reached out with his hand to grab Mo Tian.

“
Haha, I didn't expect it would be so easy to win!” On the other side, the three youths looked with a triumphant expression. They approached Luo Tian who was looking grim and took steps towards him.

“
Is it you, Duan Zijue?” The Beast Ghost King and other Heavenly Kings turned their eyes to the Heavenly Ghost King. Only the Heavenly Ghost King had the ability to secretly poison without anyone noticing.

And Shiluo Palace had a special relationship with the Heavenly Ghost King. The poison often sold to Shiluo Palace.

“
Duan Zijue, are you trying to get yourself killed? You dare to use poison on them!” The Beast Ghost King immediately scolded.

“
Duan Zijue, if my son has any problems, you can stay behind!” The Mountain Ghost King and the God Ghost King also looked grim. They subtly surrounded Duan Zijue.

“
Don't worry, it's just that their cultivation will stop for an hour. They'll still be lively after an hour!”

“
After all, Shiluo Palace asked for it. I couldn't refuse!” Duan Zijue smiled and spoke softly.

Duan Zijue's words were indeed true. However, it was he who had approached Shiluo Palace and given them the poison. He dared not truly kill Luo Tian's three, otherwise there would be no place for him in hell.

Duan Zijue simply wanted Shiluo Palace to kill Luo Tian once, to satisfy his hatred. After all, in hell, as long as the soul was not destroyed, they could still be resurrected.

“
Peng…” As the eight Heavenly Kings discussed, Mo Tian was also thrown out by Wang Xiu.

“
Despicable! You used poison!” The disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace shouted loudly, their voices filled with anger.

Wheel Rotation Palace had three people fighting. But the opponent also used poison, which was clearly despicable.

However, Shiluo Palace's people didn't see it that way. In their view, as long as they won, it was fine. Luo Tian's three had chosen to come up, so they should have been prepared for defeat. Using poison was just a means.

“
I didn't expect it either!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, looking at the three who surrounded him. In an instant, he realized who it was.

“
I'll send you to your death! This is a lesson for you!” One of the youths had a dagger in his hand and rushed towards Luo Tian. If he killed Luo Tian, it would be over.

“
I'll send you to your death!” As the youth's dagger just fell, Luo Tian's voice echoed in their ears. At the same time, four punches flew from Luo Tian’s hands and hit the youth's head.

“
Peng…” Like a watermelon breaking, the youth's body fell to the ground immediately.

“
Buzz…” The black sword swung out and slashed towards the other two who hadn't reacted yet.

“
Pupu…” The two youths were beheaded immediately. Blood mist rose, and in an instant three people were killed. Blood stained Luo Tian's face.

The three youths had thought that Luo Tian was definitely dead, but they hadn't expected him to break the poison in his body and kill them instantly. The crowd was stunned, everyone's faces filled with disbelief as they watched Luo Tian standing there.

“
How could it be? My poison, how did he break it!” The Heavenly Ghost King's face was filled with disbelief.

“
You forgot to tell you, that poison of yours is the one this kid broke!” The Beast Ghost King looked at the Heavenly Ghost King's disbelieving expression and smiled.

“
Haha, I told you to use poison. You deserved it! Luo Chen's strength is magnificent! Kill that Wang Xiu too!” The disciples of Wheel Rotation Palace shouted loudly, their voices filled with excitement. At this moment, Luo Tian was their god, omnipotent.

“
Buzz…” Luo Tian extended his hand and three soul essences appeared in his hands. A smile spread across his face, making people tense again.

“
It's this move again…” Everyone was speechless, watching Luo Tian and worrying that he might destroy the three soul essences if he got excited.

“
It's really unexpected!” Luo Tian smiled playfully, looking at Wang Xiu standing a little away.

“
I didn't expect it either!” Wang Xiu's face showed a slight smile. He hadn’t expected the situation to change so quickly.

“
Surrender, or I'll destroy these three!” Luo Tian smiled and looked at Wang Xiu.

“
You dare!” As soon as Luo Tian's words were spoken, the vice-palace masters of Shiluo Palace looked furious and shouted at Luo Tian.

“
You dare!” As soon as Luo Tian's words were spoken, the vice-palace masters of Shiluo Palace looked furious and shouted at Luo Tian.
