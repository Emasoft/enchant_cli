"Not!" The elder of Xuan Yin Sect, a master at the Bone-Devouring Peak, gazed upon his sect's ancient ancestor, who had been reduced to blood mist. He let out a low growl but dared not take another step beyond the boundary.

"Dead! Dead!" The elder of Jing Lei Sect, also at the Bone-Devouring Peak, stammered in shock.

At this moment, all eyes were heavy with breath and fear, staring at the vanished blood mist.

How could a soul-annihilation realm powerhouse die so indignantly? Not even having the chance to unleash his power, he had been utterly powerless?

Chapter 156: Flesh-and-Bone Transcendence

Chapter 156: Flesh-and-Bone Transcendence

People felt some sympathy for the elder of Xuan Yin Sect at the Bone-Devouring Peak. Xuan Yin Sect's journey to Dahan Forest had been a severe blow, almost as if they'd suffered broken bones and torn flesh.

The death of a prodigy disciple combined with the loss of a soul-annihilation realm powerhouse made it impossible for this Bone-Devouring Peak elder to withstand the sect's fury.

At that moment, the elder hadn't expected things would spiral this far. It had just been a treasure hunt—yet two core figures of the sect had perished. As he thought about his fate upon returning to the sect, his body shivered involuntarily.

His thoughts raced frantically, seeking a way to calm the sect's wrath. Finally, an expression of grimness appeared on his face as he growled a name: "Luo Tian!"

Hearing the Bone-Devouring Peak elder's low growl of Luo Tian's name, those present exchanged glances of sudden understanding. Only by returning Luo Tian to Xuan Yin Sect could this elder possibly retain a sliver of hope.

Someone sighed, "A Luo Tian who could even have a soul-annihilation realm powerhouse accompany him to his death—this Luo Tian was worth it even in death."

When Ying Hongtu and the others heard the Bone-Devouring Peak elder's low growl of Luo Tian's name, they knew this elder intended to kill Luo Tian in anger. Their faces lit up with joy.

Another group shared the same expression—those who had arrived at this place but dared not enter, like Huang Tianxiao. Upon hearing the elder's roar, his heart rejoiced. Having suffered repeated humiliations, Huang Tianxiao hated Luo Tian to the core.

Chen Changsheng's face turned solemn. He took out a jade token from his waist, etching a spiritual awareness into it before gazing toward Dahan Forest: "I can only help you this far. The rest is up to your fortune!"

At the same time, atop Xuan Yin Sect's mountain gate, sect master Chen Xuanning was stunned. His disciples were equally dazed.

In the hall housing the life-destiny tablet, there was not a sound. Only heavy breathing filled the air as people stared at the shattered life-destiny tablets placed among the top ranks. These were the life-destiny tablets of one of Xuan Yin Sect's invincible ancient ancestors, Wang Tianxing. None had imagined their invincible ancestor could die.

"Master...," a senior finally controlled himself and asked Chen Xuanning.

"Who took Wang Siyuan to Dahan Forest?" Du Yongchang's gaze was cold as he surveyed the elders.

"It was Elder Lou Zhenghao!" A senior who had a slight connection with Lou Zhenghao stammered. He could sense his friend's fate upon returning to Xuan Yin Sect would be extremely grim.

Chen Xuanning said nothing. He took out a jade token from his waist and etched on it a ruthless spiritual awareness.

At that moment, Lou Zhenghao was guarding the outer perimeter of Dahan Forest. His face was twisted with rage. Feeling a stir in his jade token, he quickly took it out.

At the moment he picked up the token, a voice filled with cruelty echoed in his mind: "Lou Zhenghao! You'd better give me an explanation, or you know what your fate will be!"

Lou Zhenghao trembled as he put the token back. His face was dark, almost dripping with anger. Run? Others might not know Xuan Yin Sect's strength, but as an elder of the sect, he knew. Xuan Yin Sect had the top intelligence organization in the Northern Region. Finding him would be too easy.

To run to the Southern Region? That would require time he didn't have. Lou Zhenghao believed that if he fled, he'd be caught within three days.

The only option left for Lou Zhenghao was to gamble. He waited outside Dahan Forest, hoping to capture Luo Tian and bring him back to Xuan Yin Sect. If luck was on his side, he might even save his life.

But Luo Tian had no idea he'd been targeted by a Bone-Devouring Peak elder. He was still immersed in his battle with dragon blood.

Dong Sansi and others had not yet left Dahan Forest. They were still searching for Luo Tian. Fortunately, they hadn't gone out—otherwise, they might have been crushed by Lou Zhenghao's wrath.

"One day... two days..."

Time slowly passed. Luo Tian's body grew stronger, the dragon blood in the Dragon Transformation Pool seemed to have been absorbed and refined into his skin.

Long Jian, watching Luo Tian still in the Dragon Transformation Pool, wore a happy expression. He knew that the stronger Luo Tian's body became, the higher his plan's success rate would be.

Luo Tian felt extremely uncomfortable but knew his current strength was too weak. He couldn't let go of this opportunity—perhaps no one else would ever have such a chance.

Though his body felt like it was being burned by fire, every time he thought of Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei being taken away because his strength was insufficient, or Chen Yuting choosing to commit suicide to save him, Luo Tian gritted his teeth and endured.

Time passed for another three days. Dong Sansi and others still searched for Luo Tian's whereabouts.

Some sects outside Dahan Forest had already decided to return. With Lou Zhenghao, a Bone-Devouring Peak elder present, they didn't believe Luo Tian could leave this place alive.

Other sects chose to stay, hoping to witness if this young man who had created miracles before could once again astonish them.

On the seventh day of waiting, Luo Tian had spent seven days in the Dragon Transformation Pool. With his eyes still closed, he suddenly opened them, sensing his body had reached its current limit of refinement. He let out a long roar and leaped from the blood pool like a dragon.

Hearing Luo Tian's long roar, Long Jian, who had kept his eyes closed, opened them. His gaze showed some excitement. He'd thought Luo Tian could only endure three days at most, but he had exceeded his expectations by double.

Those guarding the cave entrance—Bai Yuqin and the凶兽—also showed a flicker of surprise. Luo Tian's roar contained a faint dragon aura, though not strong, it left them astonished.

"Seven days! This kid endured seven days?" The black ape widened his eyes. "I remember Xiao Bai only lasted five days. Xiao Bai is a凶兽's body, how could a human compare!"

The other凶兽 also found it hard to believe. A human's body had surpassed a凶兽's, but soon they were overjoyed. The longer Luo Tian endured, the higher their master's plan success rate became.

Luo Tian leaped out of the Dragon Transformation Pool. His body had not a single drop of dragon blood on it. He clenched his fists, feeling the terrifying explosive power within him. He sighed softly: "Flesh-and-Bone Transcendence?"

Chapter 157: The Origin of the Dragon Baby

Chapter 157: The Origin of the Dragon Baby

Long Jian's strength was such that he naturally sensed Luo Tian's transformation. His face showed satisfaction: "Excellent. To refine one's body to the Flesh-and-Bone Transcendence with only a cultivation realm of Body Refinement—this is the first in nearly ten thousand years!"

"Thank you, Master for the Dragon Transformation Pool!" Luo Tian naturally knew what he had gained and what price he must pay. Still, he felt some gratitude toward Long Jian and his wife.

"No need to thank me. If I didn't need you, I wouldn't have let you use the Dragon Transformation Pool!" Long Jian's face showed a serious expression.

Luo Tian sensed Long Jian's seriousness and knew what was coming next.

"You probably already guessed it—my wife and I are both dragons!" Long Jian's calm voice carried a hint of pride.

Luo Tian nodded. He had long suspected this couple were dragons. Hearing Long Jian's words, his face showed no surprise.

"Dragons are the favored of heaven—strong bodies, terrifying strength, and long lifespans. They are perfect creatures! But the one fatal weakness of dragons is their rarity!" Long Jian's face showed a hint of bitterness.

Luo Tian muttered inwardly. If dragons were as numerous as humans, the continent would have been ruled by them long ago.

"Especially in my generation. I don't know about other regions, but on the Tianyuan Continent, there are no more than five pure-blooded dragons. Including me, my wife, and the Dragon Baby!" Long Jian didn't let Luo Tian speak before continuing.

Luo Tian's face showed surprise. Though he knew dragons were rare, he hadn't expected them to be this scarce.

"But the Dragon Baby was born after my wife and I spent nearly a thousand years to create!" Long Jian's face showed pride. "Our kind doesn't cultivate through techniques but through bloodline power. Other凶兽 are the same. When the Dragon Baby was born, we discovered his bloodline power was incredibly dense—comparable to that of historical dragon emperors!"

Luo Tian looked at Long Jian oddly. Though he had never married, the thought of Long Jian spending nearly a thousand years to create a child made him think of some inappropriate things.

"Smack!" Long Jian hit Luo Tian's head. He knew what Luo Tian was thinking wasn't proper.

"But though the Dragon Baby's bloodline power is extremely dense, almost ancestral, he accidentally ate a Transformation Grass!" Long Jian's face showed regret.

"Transformation Grass!" Luo Tian also looked odd. He clearly understood what Transformation Grass was.

Transformation Grass was the main ingredient in making Transformation Pills, which allowed凶兽 to transform into human forms. Of course, this meant they would have the same body as humans but also had drawbacks—lifespans and physical strength would become like humans, while their intelligence remained凶兽-level.

So most凶兽 chose to refine themselves instead of taking Transformation Grass.

"Dragon kind's adulthood takes about a thousand years, roughly equivalent to your Body Refinement realm. Your Body Refinement realm only lives about five hundred years!" Long Jian spoke with a bitter tone.

Luo Tian understood. That meant the Dragon Baby had to break through to Bone-Devouring within five hundred years or he would die. Five hundred years for a dragon was just like a few years for a child—obviously impossible.

"What's the solution?" Luo Tian asked involuntarily.

"This problem troubled us for a long time. Later, I traveled the entire Tianyuan Continent and finally found a solution in an ancient dragon tomb!"

"What's the method?" Luo Tian knew this method was probably related to himself.

"Rebirth and Nirvana!" Long Jian's eyes showed admiration, as well as excitement.

"Nirvana Rebirth?" Luo Tian muttered the four words.

"Yes. That's Nirvana Rebirth—this life's rebirth, next life's reincarnation!" Long Jian looked at Luo Tian and said softly.

"Finding the solution requires implementation. The most important part is to find a strong-bodied person and use that secret method to let the Dragon Baby parasitically attach to this person's body, forming a symbiotic relationship.

"We spent nearly four hundred years finding this Nirvana Rebirth method. Then, for the next one hundred years, we searched for a strong-bodied person. Due to time constraints, we had no choice but to let the Dragon Baby sleep, letting him live in dreams to reduce his bodily functions' consumption and extend his life. This is why you were in that illusion before!" Unknown when, Bai Yuqin entered the cave with a strong sense of pity.

Luo Tian understood immediately. The illusion they had been in was the Dragon Baby's dream. It was cruel to let such a young child live within dreams.

"Has this method never succeeded?" Luo Tian asked again. "Or would it be better to find someone with higher cultivation to bear the Nirvana Rebirth?"

"We wished for that. After a hundred years of trials, we tested it on people from various cultivation realms and finally concluded that this method could only reach Body Refinement ninth level. The most important thing is the Dragon Baby's acceptance. Our child would never be parasitically attached to an ordinary person!" Long Jian's face showed a hint of disdain.

"Uh..." Luo Tian was momentarily speechless. Then he nodded understandingly, recalling the dragon's pride.

"That's why I created this false appearance of treasure in Dahan Forest, attracting Northern Region's top talents to come from their sects. I also didn't let Bone-Devouring realm people in. I noticed you the moment you entered Dahan Forest and have been watching you closely. Your strength and character are both reassuring, so I'm confident my child will be symbiotically attached to your body!" Long Jian's face showed approval, clearly favoring Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt secretly happy. Being praised by such a powerful being meant his future was recognized.

"I will do my best!" Luo Tian bowed with determination in his eyes.

"Then, let's begin," Long Jian said, smiling slightly.

Chapter 158: Nirvana Seal

Chapter 158: Nirvana Seal

"Don't worry, this secret technique won't harm you. This might be the Dragon Baby's last chance because he has been sleeping for two hundred years and has exceeded his limit!" Long Jian spoke seriously.

Luo Tian felt the gravity on the couple's faces and nodded slightly. He sat cross-legged.

"Relax your mind and body! Don't resist at all, or it will be in vain. Remember, even if you feel danger, don't resist. Be careful!" Long Jian's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian tried to relax his body and mind. He could clearly feel the Dragon Baby's soft snoring. Luo Tian smiled knowingly, no longer worrying about other matters. If he had chosen to help, he must see it through.

Long Jian and his wife Bai Yuqin wore serious expressions. Their hands continuously changed, forming golden seals that they pressed onto Luo Tian's body. These movements were skillful, obviously performed countless times before.

At this moment, Luo Tian seemed to be covered with golden inscriptions, emitting a faint golden light.

Long Jian and Bai Yuqin took a breath. Even such a strong person's technique required breathing, showing the complexity of the inscriptions on Luo Tian's body.

"The timing is just right. The Dragon Baby hasn't awakened yet!" Long Jian's voice echoed again, accompanied by a series of dragon roars and deep spiritual awareness rushing toward the Dragon Baby.

"Roar..." After this roar, the entire Dahan Forest seemed to be ignited. All凶兽 looked at the cave with fiery eyes, bowing and worshiping their king.

"I wonder how things are inside!" The black ape looked worried, growling softly.

"Don't worry. I think this kid's body is strong enough. This time, he'll definitely succeed! Mengmo, let the Dragon Baby come out of his dream!" The black tiger, whether comforting the other凶兽 or himself, said softly.

Beside him was a snow-white Mengmo. His face was also serious. Strangely, his voice wasn't loud but clearly reached the ears of all凶兽.

"Daddy, Mommy!" A dragon roar filled with bloodline power woke the Dragon Baby from his dream. A weak voice came out of the Dragon Baby's mouth.

Hearing this sound, Long Jian and Bai Yuqin trembled slightly. A stream of tears flowed from Bai Yuqin's eyes. The Dragon Baby flew down from the sky and landed in Bai Yuqin's arms. The small baby felt what would happen today, his face no longer had any mischief but gently tried to wipe Bai Yuqin's tears.

"Son, from now on, you'll follow this brother, okay?" Long Jian's face showed a rare gentleness. He took the Dragon Baby from Bai Yuqin's arms and asked softly.

The Dragon Baby had been awakened by his parents many times for those strange rituals. He knew this awakening meant another strange ritual.

Following Long Jian's gaze, the Dragon Baby looked at Luo Tian with innocent eyes. His face showed great joy, and soon drool flowed from his mouth: "Good! This brother can make sugar!"

Luo Tian, wrapped in countless inscriptions, couldn't move but could hear the Dragon Baby's words. He sighed bitterly, never expecting his only attraction to the Dragon Baby would be medicine.

"Good!" Long Jian put the Dragon Baby back into Bai Yuqin's arms. He knew Bai Yuqin needed this moment of warmth.

"Long'er, remember to listen to your brother when you're awake!" Bai Yuqin continuously reminded the Dragon Baby in her arms.

The Dragon Baby seemed to have grown up, nodding repeatedly.

"Alright, go sit next to your brother. This time it might be more painful than usual, but remember, you are a dragon's descendant and must live proudly!" Long Jian told the Dragon Baby softly, reminding him to be serious.

"Okay!" The Dragon Baby proudly lifted his head, showing a determined expression.

Long Jian and Bai Yuqin exchanged glances, nodded, and their hands changed again. Golden inscriptions formed from the couple's hands, encircling the Dragon Baby as well.

Seeing both of them with closed eyes, Long Jian's face showed no relaxation. He roared: "Nascent Soul Meridian!"

Long Jian waved his hand, and the Nascent Soul Meridian from Luo Tian's storage ring flew out on its own, emitting a dense spiritual energy. It landed in Long Jian's hands.

"Only three-quarters left? That's enough!" Long Jian showed satisfaction.

Luo Tian knew his hard-earned Nascent Soul Meridian had been taken from his storage ring. He realized this meridian might change hands.

"Soulsoul Blood!" Long Jian roared again. A terrifying pressure-filled blood appeared in his hands—this was the soulblood of Wang Tianxing, an ancient ancestor of Xuan Yin Sect.

"Use Nascent Soul Meridian as a bridge and soulblood as the trigger. Seal for eternal rebirth, helping my son's Nirvana!" Long Jian's face was serious as he roared into the air.

Bai Yuqin controlled the soulblood with her hands, showing a hint of seriousness as well.

The Nascent Soul Meridian emitted infinite light, seemingly forming a bridge connecting Luo Tian and the Dragon Baby's bodies. The soulblood flowed through the Nascent Soul Meridian, entering their inscriptions and turning both bodies into a strange blood-red color.

"As the soulblood reached Luo Tian's body, he felt intense pain on his skin. However, after being refined by the Dragon Transformation Pool, this soulblood was like a light rain to him.

But immediately after, Luo Tian felt bitter sorrow. He realized the dense inscriptions on his body also exerted a pressing force, as if trying to crush him. They kept compressing.

If he could scream at this moment, Luo Tian would definitely do so. He was in pain but secretly thanked his Body Refinement Transcendence—otherwise, he might not have endured it.

Time slowly passed. A day had gone by.

Luo Tian seemed to forget time's existence, constantly enduring the pressure from the inscriptions. He also felt心疼 for his Nascent Soul Meridian.

During this day, Long Jian and Bai Yuqin didn't stop. After the soulblood was exhausted, they cut their wrists, continuously dripping their blood onto the Nascent Soul Meridian.

Finally, after their efforts, both Luo Tian and the Dragon Baby's inscriptions turned blood-red.

Seeing this situation, Long Jian and Bai Yuqin gradually pale faces showed joy. They formed a seal: "Seal!"

Chapter 159: Fusion of the Killing Pearl

Chapter 159: Fusion of the Killing Pearl

With Long Jian and Bai Yuqin's low roar, the bloodstained Nascent Soul Meridian suddenly became smaller. It forcibly penetrated into the Dragon Baby's back, forming the shape of his spine.

Bai Yuqin restrained her urge to cry. She knew the Dragon Baby was enduring what kind of pain at this moment, but there was no choice. This was for the Dragon Baby's good. Making the Nascent Soul Meridian become his spine would make the Dragon Baby's future prospects limitless, even more terrifying than before when his bloodline was extremely dense.

Finally, as the two of them said "Seal," Luo Tian and the Dragon Baby's seals suddenly rushed like snakes, getting smaller and smaller.

At this moment, the Dragon Baby had awakened. He continuously cried out in pain, his eyes filled with tears.

Luo Tian's previous dragon seal constantly emitted a green light. A hot sensation came from his wrist, drawing all the inscriptions into the dragon seal.

The Dragon Baby's weak body gradually transformed in Luo Tian's astonished gaze into a golden dragon, circling in the air. It spoke human words repeatedly: "Baby hurts! Hurts! Hurts!"

The childish voice reached the ears of the凶兽 outside the cave. The fierce凶兽, who had looked at the Dragon Baby since childhood, showed expressions of pity. They had no offspring and had long considered the Dragon Baby as their child. Now that the Dragon Baby was in pain, how could they not feel heartbroken?

"Stay strong!" The凶兽 roared.

Since the Dragon Baby's true form appeared, the凶兽 on the ground seemed to sense something terrifying and trembled.

"Seal!" A voice with dragon power echoed from Long Jian's mouth again.

"Roar..." A thunderous dragon roar came from the Dragon Baby's mouth, echoing throughout Dahan Forest.

After roaring, the Dragon Baby's body was rapidly bound by red inscriptions.

When the Dragon Baby had shrunk to palm size:

"Seal!" Long Jian's eyes were wild, and he roared again.

"Bzz..." The Dragon Baby's small body turned into a golden light, instantly covering Luo Tian's dragon seal on his hand.

Luo Tian's green dragon seal turned golden at this moment.

"Success!" Bai Yuqin and Long Jian showed a hint of joy in their eyes.

At the moment the golden dragon seal formed, Luo Tian felt a mountain-like aura land on his left hand.

"Crack!" The sound of bones breaking continuously came from Luo Tian's arm.

A stream of sweat flowed down Luo Tian's head.

It was too heavy. Now that Luo Tian had achieved Body Refinement Transcendence, such a powerful body was already on the verge of breaking under this Nirvana Seal.

A sealing force also entered Luo Tian's body from the Nirvana Seal, subtly aiming to seal his cultivation.

"Body Refinement Eighth Level! Body Refinement Seventh Level!" Luo Tian's cultivation level continuously dropped over time.

Luo Tian naturally felt the condition of his body and showed a bitter smile. He looked at Long Jian and Bai Yuqin, hoping they could help him.

Long Jian and Bai Yuqin naturally felt the changes in Luo Tian's body. Their faces were shocked. Previously, they had tested people with at least Bone-Devouring Peak cultivation levels. They hadn't considered whether the person could withstand this sealing force.

Now, as Luo Tian's cultivation level continued to drop, they finally realized the truth. Looking at Luo Tian's求助 gaze, Long Jian and Bai Yuqin showed a bitter expression.

Bai Yuqin even whispered: "If Luo Tian truly became an ordinary person, or worse, died, it would mean the Nirvana Seal failed again. The Dragon Baby and Luo Tian would also be doomed."

"Body Refinement Fourth Level!" When Luo Tian's cultivation level dropped to Body Refinement Fourth Level, he didn't hesitate and poured a pill into his mouth without knowing what kind of pill it was.

"Bzz..." The pill instantly turned into a surge of spiritual energy filling Luo Tian's meridians. However, he had underestimated the power of the Nirvana Seal. The pill was only a drop in the bucket, temporarily delaying the sealing force.

Luo Tian's forehead was drenched with sweat. He knew if this continued, he would eventually be exhausted to death.

"I can't die! Qianxue and Gu Lei are waiting for me to rescue them! I haven't even met my master's true form. How could I face him!" Luo Tian, while desperately resisting the sealing force, his mind raced for a way to break through this seal.

"Killing Pearl!"

Luo Tian's mind suddenly lit up. A cold, killing-aura emitting pearl appeared in his hand.

Yes, it was the Killing Pearl. It was the only way Luo Tian could think of to break through this sealing force.

Though the Killing Pearl contained terrifying killing energy, it also contained a terrifying five-element spiritual energy.

After thinking this over, Luo Tian didn't hesitate. His cultivation level had dropped to Body Refinement Third Level. He directly placed the Killing Pearl on his head.

"Killing Pearl!" Long Jian's tense expression eased slightly. He could feel the wild spiritual energy within the Killing Pearl. Though the killing aura was strong, it seemed insignificant to Long Jian.

"Bzz..." The Killing Pearl instantly penetrated into Luo Tian's forehead.

Luo Tian felt his whole body go cold. A voice echoed in his mind: "Kill! Kill! Kill!"

Suppressing the intense killing intent, Luo Tian desperately activated the Five-Element Spiritual Transformation Technique to refine this killing energy.

Luo Tian's eyes turned red, with endless killing intent凝聚 in his gaze. His Nirvana Dragon Seal also seemed to sense Luo Tian's abnormality, glowing red and appearing more sinister.

Long Jian had already prepared to intervene at any moment to save Luo Tian. Seeing that although Luo Tian's killing intent surged, it was still under his control and his cultivation level had stopped dropping. It even showed a slight upward trend, Long Jian's face was tense and he prayed silently for Luo Tian to succeed.

"Please succeed!" The凶兽 outside Dahan Forest also prayed together.

"Body Refinement Fifth Level! Body Refinement Sixth Level!" A short while later, Luo Tian's cultivation level had recovered to Body Refinement Sixth Level.

As his cultivation level increased, Luo Tian found it easier to resist the sealing force. However, the killing aura in his mind became stronger. He also divided a part of his thoughts to deal with it.

Closing his eyes, Luo Tian sat in meditation like an old monk in the cave.

Beside him, Long Jian and Bai Yuqin took a deep breath. Luo Tian's situation was developing in the right direction.

But both still felt worried and sat beside Luo Tian to guard him, while the凶兽 outside the cave were tense.

With the emotions of these major figures in Dahan Forest, the entire Dahan Forest seemed to be filled with this tense atmosphere.

Chapter 160: The Powerful Luo Tian

Chapter 160: The Powerful Luo Tian

Dahan Forest, a notorious dangerous place on the Tianyuan Continent, was now filled with tension.

A month had passed since Luo Tian was subjected to the Nirvana Seal. During this month, the most worried about Luo Tian's safety were Long Jian and Bai Yuqin. They spent each day as if it were a year.

Looking at Luo Tian, who was meditating like an old monk, Long Jian and Bai Yuqin noticed his cultivation level had slowly risen to Body Refinement Seventh Level. The killing aura on his body was also decreasing, so their hearts finally relaxed.

Other people who were worried about Luo Tian included Dong Sansi and others. These people wandered in Dahan Forest, naturally noticing the strange occurrences within it. Normally fierce凶兽 had not attacked them, which made these people feel more at ease while searching for Luo Tian.

Although Dong Sansi and others didn't know why the凶兽 weren't attacking them, they vaguely suspected it was related to Luo Tian.

Long Jian naturally knew Dong Sansi and others were in Dahan Forest. He also knew this group were friends of Luo Tian. How could he let his friend's safety be harmed on his territory?

Other sects, having not seen Luo Tian for a long time, lost patience and returned to their sects.

The Bone-Devouring Peak elder of Xuan Yin Sect was taken away by an Elder of the Nascent Soul realm on the fifteenth day. A Bone-Devouring Peak beginner was left to wait for Luo Tian's appearance.

As for those who had originally wanted to see how Luo Tian died—Huang Tianxiao's group—they fled quickly after receiving a transmission from their sect master.

Huang Tianxiao had no choice but to flee because Xuan Yin Sect had declared war on the Five Elements Sect. After that Bone-Devouring Peak elder was taken back, Xuan Yin Sect's sect master led his forces to the sky above Five Elements Sect and demanded they hand over Luo Tian.

Wei Mingxuan, the sect master of Five Elements Sect, was no weakling. He would never hand over Luo Tian. If he did, Five Elements Sect's face would be ruined.

The result was a fierce battle. Five Elements Sect was known as the top sect in the Northern Region, even the top of the Tianyuan Continent. However, Xuan Yin Sect's forces could not withstand it and were defeated.

However, the next day, Xuan Yin Sect showed their terrifying power. Their sect master Du Yongchang issued an order: all of Xuan Yin Sect's assassins would begin hunting Five Elements Sect disciples. No matter if they were inner or outer sect members, or even a lowly servant, none would be spared.

At this point, Five Elements Sect disciples outside the sect were caught in a hunting environment. Some with strong abilities not only avoided being hunted but also hunted Xuan Yin Sect disciples. This caused chaos in the Northern Region between these two sects.

Other first-tier sects watched from the sidelines, taking no action. Some second-tier sects were like grass in the wind, swaying between sides.

The one who caused all this was Luo Tian. At that moment, he sat in meditation within Long Jian and Bai Yuqin's cave. His body emitted terrifying fluctuations. Though he seemed to be only Body Refinement Eighth Level, Long Jian felt the fluctuations from this young man were stronger than those of a typical Bone-Devouring realm.

"Roar..." That day, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes. A streak of bloodlight vanished from his eyes, replaced by a clear gaze.

"Dragon Power!" Long Jian's face showed surprise. He hadn't expected Luo Tian's roar to contain dragon power, even comparable to some earth dragons.

"Success!" Bai Yuqin's face showed excitement upon seeing Luo Tian succeed.

"It really is a five-element talent. I never thought he could survive this!" The凶兽 outside the cave showed human-like sighs.

He clenched his fists, producing a crisp sound. Luo Tian's face showed a light smile. This journey through Dahan Forest had been a transformation for him, no less than obtaining the Book of Epochs.

After being refined in the blood pool, his body was comparable to Bone-Devouring. The Killing Pearl he had merged with allowed him, though only Body Refinement Eighth Level, to have spiritual energy strength comparable to Bone-Devouring First Stage. Now, his dantian's spiritual energy had transformed from a few drops into liquid form, vastly stronger than before.

Moreover, he had been sealed with some cultivation levels. If the seal ever lifted, he couldn't imagine how strong he could become.

Plus, now he was only Body Refinement Eighth Level. That meant his level had dropped, but the space for growth was even greater.

"Now I am no longer lacking that miraculous Nascent Soul. Other aspects are enough to rival Bone-Devouring!" Luo Tian's face showed confidence.

"Kid! Excellent!" Long Jian approached and patted Luo Tian's shoulder, his eyes showing no concealment of admiration.

"Thank you again, Master!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully. He still dared not be reckless toward this terrifying Long Jian.

"Luo Tian, our child will now be under your care. If you encounter any trouble, feel free to come here to seek our protection. Believe no one would dare to bother us in Dahan Forest!" Long Jian's face showed pride.

"You know what? You should just stay in Dahan Forest! It would be safer!" Bai Yuqin, out of concern, softly urged.

Hearing Bai Yuqin's words, Luo Tian was stunned. He thought about the countless opportunities in Dahan Forest and felt a flicker of temptation, but he quickly dismissed it.

Though he would be completely safe in Dahan Forest, with its resources, he could reach the Nascent Soul realm even with his eyes closed. But that wasn't what Luo Tian wanted. He preferred to earn everything through his own struggle instead of being a sapling under someone's protection.
