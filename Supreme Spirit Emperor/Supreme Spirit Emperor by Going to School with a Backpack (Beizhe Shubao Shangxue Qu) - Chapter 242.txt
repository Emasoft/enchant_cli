“Too simple!” Zheng Xin muttered to herself, her eyes filled with disbelief, a sense of disappointment lingering within. She had expected a fierce battle, but now felt as if she'd thrown her full strength into an empty punch. Her heart was annoyed.

“Alright, that's settled. You all fight it out as you wish!” Three peak Sage-level masters vanished under the gazes of everyone, leaving a group of stunned demons and Luotian.

“Hail the clan leader!” Those two factions who had previously supported Nan Gong Yuqing’s father wore expressions of great joy, bowing respectfully to Nan Gong Bo.

“Hmph…” Nan Gong Bo was momentarily stunned before his expression slightly changed, quickly subduing the two.

Luotian furrowed his brows, observing the other factions who remained indifferent. He knew those three elders weren’t senile; this situation wasn’t as simple as it seemed.

The thousand and forty-sixth chapter: Pressure()

In the Divine Beast Domain, atop the demon mountain, everyone stared in shock as the three elders vanished from sight. None expected them to be so unreliable, leaving the demon mountain with a casual remark.

“Hail the clan leader!” Two elder factions who had previously supported Nan Gong De wore smiles, their voices tinged with quiet joy.

Nan Gong De’s supporters had all been eliminated by Nan Gong Liang. Their survival was only due to their Sage-level late-stage strength, giving them a place within the demon clan. Otherwise, they would have been wiped out entirely. Even so, their days were grim.

Luotian stood still, his eyes thoughtful as he glanced at the other elders standing with Nan Gong Liang. He sighed inwardly; this clan leader position wasn’t as easy as they imagined.

“Come on, Nan Gong Liang! You two don’t have to be so hesitant!” Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong showed no signs of discomfort, issuing orders to Nan Gong Liang.

“Also, you’re all family now! Hurry up and greet your new clan leader!” Wan Lingkong shouted at the demon disciples.

The demon disciples looked at each other, confusion in their eyes. They were still unaccustomed to this rapid change of clan leader.

“Hail the clan leader!” Nan Gong Liang wore a slight smile, giving a meaningful glance to those around him. His gaze held mockery as he casually bowed to Nan Gong Bo.

Nan Gong Bo’s face bore a hint of killing intent. He had no real interest in this clan leader position, but for Nan Gong Yuqing’s sake—Nan Gong Yuqing would eventually seek to ascend to the Era-Transcendent realm, perhaps even higher. The resources required were immense, and the demon clan’s depth was profound; Nan Gong Yuqing needed their support.

Otherwise, Nan Gong Bo would have already struck Nan Gong Liang down. However, he knew that if he acted now, it would leave room for criticism.

“Alright, get up. From today on, we’ll reside in the old clan leader’s quarters. Go prepare!” Nan Gong Bo addressed Nan Gong Liang and his elders.

“Hmph, really big attitude!” A late-stage Sage elder wore a mocking expression.

“Fine, I’ll go prepare right away!” Nan Gong Liang ignored the elders’ mockery and maintained a smile, surprising everyone.

“Clan leader, these are minor matters. Let’s discuss the clan’s major affairs now!” Nan Gong Liang spoke, his gaze locking with Nan Gong Bo's.

“Speak,” Nan Gong Bo knew Nan Gong Liang wouldn’t back down. This clan leader position was no easy task. He spoke solemnly to Nan Gong Liang.

“This kid killed two of our demon princes, constantly provoking us. Won’t you deal with it?”

“Also, the Ancient Divine Palace’s treasure—our clan didn’t participate in the last competition. Shouldn’t we join now? Do you plan to go yourself, since you’re the clan leader? Otherwise, our old men won’t accept it!”

“Of course, recently there were strange fluctuations in the Divine Beast Cave. It’s rumored that a treasure has arrived. Do you plan to send our prince there?”

Nan Gong Liang didn’t give Nan Gong Bo a chance to object, shaking his head lightly and watching him with folded hands.

“Indeed, clan leader, these are major matters. Please handle them so we can gain some achievements for the demon clan!” Several elders supporting Nan Gong Liang echoed in agreement.

“Despicable, despicable!” Zheng Xin watched Nan Gong Liang’s hypocritical and shameless demeanor, unable to hold back a low sigh.

“Outwitting Nan Gong Bo!” Everyone silently thought this.

Luotian’s relationship with Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing was clearly not ordinary. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have risked his life to come to the demon clan. Nan Gong Bo would never harm Luotian and his group.

The Ancient Divine Palace had even caused peak Sage-level masters to fall. How could Nan Gong Bo, a late-stage Sage, handle it?

As for the third matter, everyone knew the Divine Beast Cave was one of the nine deadly regions in the Nine Domains. Located within the Divine Beast Domain, it was called a deadly region for good reason—no one could enter freely.

Three matters. None of them were achievable by a late-stage Sage. Each was pushing Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing toward the brink.

“Nan Gong Liang, you really think highly of yourself! Luotian is my friend and Yuqing’s. I won’t harm him. As for the other two matters, heh, as clan leader, I have the right to assign who goes. So I’ll issue my first command as clan leader: Nan Gong Liang will go to the Divine Beast Cave and investigate its conditions!” Nan Gong Bo was no pushover. He immediately passed the ball back to Nan Gong Liang.

Nan Gong Liang knew Nan Gong Bo wasn’t easy to fool. A slight smile crossed his face: “The second and third matters can wait, but the first—this kid must die. Otherwise, how can our demon clan stand? Even if I agree, the millions of demon disciples won’t accept it!”

After speaking, Nan Gong Liang’s gaze swept over the densely packed demon disciples surrounding them, a smile on his face.

“Yes, clan leader, this kid really deserves to die!”

“Exactly! Killing our two demon princes was a disgrace. He must be killed and not spared!” A chorus of murmurs erupted among the crowd, spurred by certain individuals. The demon disciples grew rowdy, their gazes filled with killing intent toward Luotian.

“Self-inflicted death—don’t blame me!” Nan Gong Bo heard Luotian’s mental transmission, a slight smirk on his lips.

“I’ll make a concession. Anyone among you can challenge Luotian. Life or death is fate—those who kill him are unlucky, and those who fail to kill him must accept their own misfortune. Are you brave enough?” Nan Gong Bo smiled, scanning the faces of Nan Gong Liang and several elders with a look of contempt.

“Who…?” A hot-tempered elder started to speak, but upon seeing Luotian’s Shangtian Bow, he closed his mouth.

“Who dares?” Nan Gong Bo smiled confidently, taking over the elder’s words and addressing Nan Gong Liang.

“However, first of all, don’t use pseudo-Era Treasures. If you do, I won’t mind calling upon the clan’s true Era Treasures. My old men can gather a couple of pseudo-Era Treasures!” Nan Gong Liang continued.

Upon hearing this, Nan Gong Yuqing and Nan Gong Bo’s eyes darkened slightly. They glanced at Luotian with questioning looks.

“It’s fine!” Luotian nodded lightly, uttering only two words. Yet these two words revealed his immense confidence.

“Hiss…” The demon clan members let out a series of gasps. Due to the Heavenly Dao’s suppression, unless Luotian willingly revealed his cultivation, few could perceive it. The demon clan still believed Luotian remained at the early-stage Sage level, as external rumors claimed he would forever stay there.

“Who dares to fight a late-stage Sage with an early-stage one?” The demon clan members wore expressions of admiration.

“Haha, kid! Without pseudo-Era Treasures, what are you?” Nan Gong Liang’s eyes gleamed with joy. He hadn’t expected Luotian to actually agree.

“Although I’m not much, killing you old man is enough. Want me to add your prince too?” Luotian smiled, casting a glance at the new demon prince Nan Gong Tuo.

“Arrogant! I’ll try!” Nan Gong Tuo’s face darkened upon Luotian’s provocation. A late-stage Sage aura radiated from him.

“Late-stage Sage! The prince has reached the late-stage Sage. What kind of cultivation speed is this!” The demon clan members wore expressions of shock, gazing at Nan Gong Tuo with disbelief. They hadn’t expected his strength to have reached the late-stage Sage.

Although the three elders had declared Nan Gong Yuqing as the prince, people still instinctively called Nan Gong Tuo the prince upon seeing him.

“Tuo’er, you don’t need to fight. I’ll handle it!” Nan Gong Bo wore a loving expression, gazing at his descendant. The previous two princes—Nan Gong Feibai and the one killed by Luotian—were merely pawns he had set up for the two factions. To pacify them, even if Luotian didn’t kill them, they wouldn’t have survived long after his retirement.

“Just an early-stage Sage. Without pseudo-Era Treasures, killing him is like slaughtering a chicken!” Nan Gong Tuo wore an expression of disdain. If he wanted to be the demon prince, he would have already been one. To him, Luotian was merely a genius relying on external tools.

“Don’t be so bold you’ll catch a cold!” Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong wore expressions of contempt, mocking.

“Don’t think you can escape! After I finish him, the two of you won’t be able to leave either!” Nan Gong Tuo’s black aura surged, his gaze fierce as he looked at Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong.

“Alas, the third demon prince is about to fall. I advise you all to find another prince in advance!” Zheng Xin addressed the demon clan, inciting another outburst. The demon clan members glared at Zheng Xin with hatred, wishing to tear her mouth apart. Her words were simply too venomous.

“Enough talk! Let’s go!” Nan Gong Tuo knew he couldn’t argue with Zheng Xin. He coldly turned his gaze to Luotian.

“Hmph! So eager to die, I’ll grant your wish!” Luotian didn’t say another word and followed the group.

The demon disciples naturally cleared a path. Nan Gong Liang led Nan Gong Tuo and several elders, their faces filled with cold killing intent as they marched into the martial arena on the mountain’s slope.

“Clan leader, do you think he has a chance?” Nan Gong Kai and another elder wore expressions of concern. After all, Luotian represented the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Fire Domain. If he truly died in the demon clan, it would be a major problem.

“Don’t worry!” Nan Gong Bo nodded lightly. He knew Luotian’s true strength; even he found it challenging.

The thousand and forty-seventh chapter: The Formless Demon Finger()

In the demon clan’s mountain, on the vast martial arena at the slope, black patterns covered the towering platform, indicating its sturdiness.

This was where each demon clan leader accepted challenges. Now, Luotian stood there as an outsider—this was the first time in years.

The arena outside teemed with people, black-clad demon disciples forming a dark cloud. They watched the two young men—one black, one white—standing on the platform, embodying extremes. They stared at each other, invisible waves forming before them.

“Three strikes, and I’ll kill you!” Nan Gong Tuo’s face was cold. A black holy weapon sword fell into his hand, radiating a fierce aura.

“Haha, come on. You’ll be my third demon prince killed! Oh wait, you’re no longer a prince now. The current prince is Nan Gong Yuqing!” Luotian shook his head lightly.

“You must die!” Nan Gong Tuo roared, his black wind swirling as he approached Luotian.

Nan Gong Tuo’s speed seemed slow, but in an instant, he was at Luotian’s front. The black sword slashed downward, slicing through the void with an intent to split Luotian in two.

“Crack…” Golden light flared as Luotian raised his golden crackling spear, the sound of a thunderclap echoing across the arena. Some low-level disciples felt dizzy.

“Again!” Nan Gong Tuo’s arm trembled from the impact. He still didn’t believe Luotian was stronger than him. The black holy weapon sword slashed again toward Luotian.

Luotian’s blood and qi surged. He chuckled lightly, finding no real interest in fighting Nan Gong Tuo. If he wanted to kill him, it would take less than ten rounds.

But this was the demon clan. To kill Nan Gong Tuo in front of late-stage Sage eyes, he needed to strike unexpectedly and instantly. Otherwise, it would be difficult. If he died, no one would say anything. But if Nan Gong Tuo was in danger, Luotian knew the late-stage Sage demon clan members outside wouldn’t sit idly by.

“Feign weakness!” Luotian planned to make the demon clan believe he was inferior to Nan Gong Tuo. He would find an opportunity for a one-hit kill. This Nan Gong Tuo couldn’t be left alive—this was the perfect chance to eliminate a faction of Nan Gong Liang. After all, accurately speaking, this Nan Gong Tuo was an enemy of Nan Gong Yuqing. He needed to clear the path for his future.

“I can’t stay long in the demon clan. The best way is to eliminate those people!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with coldness as he clashed his crackling spear against Nan Gong Tuo’s sword.

Each clash sent Luotian back a few steps, his face growing paler. To outsiders, it seemed he couldn’t withstand Nan Gong Tuo.

“Haha! Reincarnation Body? Just a trash. Without pseudo-Era Treasures, you’re already so beaten!” The black-clad demon disciples sneered, mocking.

“Exactly! His name is a fraud. From the looks of it, he’ll be killed by the prince within a hundred strikes! A ‘Prince Killer’? I spit!” The demon clan members cursed, their voices filled with disdain. Their gazes were feverish toward Nan Gong Tuo.

“If I kill Luotian, Tuo’er will be famous across the Nine Domains!” Nan Gong Liang wore a faint smile. He hadn’t expected Luotian, without pseudo-Era Treasures, to be so useless.

“Boom…” As Luotian retreated step by step, he finally reached the edge of the platform. His body collided with a massive barrier, producing a thunderous sound.

“Puke…” Luotian bit his tongue, spitting out golden holy blood. His face showed weakness as he gazed at Nan Gong Tuo.

“Haha, Reincarnation Body. You’re not worthy of the name. Don’t spit blood; I heard Reincarnation Blood is a treasure!” Nan Gong Tuo looked at Luotian, standing high in the sky. He spoke loudly.

“Warm-up’s over. Now I’ll send you to your death!” Nan Gong Tuo gazed at Luotian, his hands flashing with black light. He fused the light into his fingers.

“Formless Demon Finger!” Nan Gong Tuo roared, deciding not to waste time. He would end Luotian immediately.

Black fingers resembled a mountain of darkness, lightning swirling around them. The aura was terrifying, causing people to hold their breaths and gape in awe.

“Unsurpassed! Even I feel a chill. I dare not face it directly!” A late-stage Sage’s strength wore an expression of awe, watching the dark aura. It seemed like a demon god’s finger pressing down on Luotian.

“Haha! The legend of the Reincarnation Body ends today!” The demon clan members shouted, beginning to cheer.

“Hmph. It’s too early to celebrate!” Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, and Wan Lingkong thought coldly. Though they didn’t know Luotian’s plan, they still believed he wouldn’t lose—no matter the Sage level, Luotian was invincible.

Under people’s gazes, the black finger pressed onto Luotian. His face slightly changed.

“Defend!” Luotian’s eyes showed a hint of seriousness. His body glowed with golden light, waves of sound echoing like the Dao’s voice within him.

Luotian raised his hands in a gesture to hold up the sky. He clashed with the black finger instantly.

“Crack…” The black finger shattered, turning into a storm of dark mist. It obscured people’s vision.

Dark mist spread, violent waves continuously striking the surrounding barriers. The barriers trembled. The demon aura filled the barrier completely, making it impossible to see inside from afar. From a distance, the entire barrier looked like a balloon filled with demon aura.

“What’s the result? Has Luotian been reborn in blood, or has he been crushed entirely?” The demon clan members were curious. They expected little chance of Luotian surviving this strike, as it was a technique even late-stage Sages feared. Even if he survived, he would be severely wounded.

But the next moment, a golden light flashed within the barrier. The light was so fast that some people didn’t even notice its presence.

“Ah…” A scream echoed from within the barrier, causing the demon clan members to rejoice.

“Haha! He must have been reborn in blood. This is the second time he’s been killed!” The demon clan members, hearing this scream, erupted into chaos.

However, the late-stage Sage elders felt something wasn’t as expected. That golden light was too strange and fast; they hadn’t reacted in time. Though Nan Gong Tuo was a genius, his movement wasn’t particularly skilled.

“Ah…” Another scream echoed. This made the late-stage Sage elders unable to sit still. They exchanged glances and rushed forward, opening the barrier.

“Boom…” Dark demon aura surged out of the barrier. It gradually dissipated.

“Haha! Let’s see if the Reincarnation Body is still alive!” The demon disciples shouted, their voices filled with excitement.

But the next moment, the entire arena—nearly ten million demon disciples and elders—gaped in disbelief. The atmosphere was terrifyingly silent.

In the view, Luotian stood on the platform, his foot pressing onto Nan Gong Tuo’s pale face. His golden spear was embedded in Nan Gong Tuo’s dantian, pinning him to the platform.

“Haha! I’ve disappointed you!” Luotian smiled coldly. After so long of feigning weakness, he had waited for this opportunity.

“Killing you—third strike. This is the third!” Luotian’s face held mockery as he kicked Nan Gong Tuo with his foot.

“Little brat, stop!”
“Die!” Just as Luotian’s foot descended, several late-stage Sage elders couldn’t sit still. They transformed into dark streaks and rushed toward Luotian.

“Haha! Despicable!” Luotian laughed, watching the elders rushing toward him. He took out his Shangtian Bow and continued to stomp Nan Gong Tuo into a blood mist on the platform.

“Ah… I want you dead!” Nan Gong Liang’s face showed madness. Seeing his most beloved descendant die, he went mad and rushed toward Luotian.

“Old dog! You’re breaking the rules by surrounding me. Don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Luotian’s mouth curled slightly. His aura no longer held back, and a mid-stage Sage aura rose from his body.

His blood and qi surged. The pressure made Nan Gong Liang and the elders feel strong, their bodies suddenly stopping.

“Break…” Luotian didn’t care. They were surrounding him—this was the effect he wanted. He would use this chance to eliminate Nan Gong Liang as well.

Entering demon realm, the梵天攻杀术 (Bodhi Attack) was executed seamlessly. A black light shot from Luotian’s hand, directly flying toward Nan Gong Liang.

The black demon arrow seemed to surpass speed limits. In an instant, it reached Nan Gong Liang’s front. His face turned pale with madness. A strong sense of life and death made him tremble.

“Damn!” Nan Gong Liang cursed, regaining his composure. He looked at the approaching black demon arrow with a fierce expression.

The thousand and forty-eighth chapter: The Thousand Mechanisms Heavenly Demon Umbrella()

In the demon clan’s martial arena, a black demon arrow tore through the sky, flying toward Nan Gong Liang.

Luotian was now a mid-stage Sage. His Reincarnation Body, formidable physique, and strong blood and qi made him a terrifying force. Combined with his already stronger dantian than others, his current strength was beyond limits—capable of harming late-stage Sages. Especially with the aid of pseudo-Era Treasures, his Shangtian Bow had previously wounded late-stage Sages.

The life and death crisis instantly invaded Nan Gong Liang’s mind. His face showed madness. He summoned a black small umbrella in his hand.

Nan Gong Liang didn’t hesitate. As an ancient being, he had faced countless crises. Even Nan Gong De had been outwitted before. Clearly, Nan Gong Liang wasn’t an ordinary late-stage Sage.

The black umbrella opened, shielding Nan Gong Liang’s body. The umbrella was engraved with ghostly face-like symbols, grotesque and smiling or crying.

“Boom…” In an instant, the black demon arrow collided with the umbrella. A powerful explosion echoed, sending several late-stage Sages who hadn’t reacted in time back nearly a hundred feet.

Dark mist again covered the sky. Nan Gong Liang stood pale in people’s sight, his lips bleeding as he gazed at Luotian with venom.

“Thousand Mechanisms Heavenly Demon Umbrella!” Nan Gong Bo’s face slightly changed, gazing at the black umbrella in Nan Gong Liang’s hand.

“Unexpectedly, Nan Gong Liang has gained the approval of the Thousand Mechanisms Heavenly Demon Umbrella. He’s hidden deep, even we didn’t know!” Nan Gong Kai wore a look of admiration as he gazed at the demon umbrella in Nan Gong Liang’s hand.

“Kid, today no one can save you. You must die!” Nan Gong Liang’s face was grim as he gazed at Luotian, his voice cold.

“Nan Gong Liang, what use are your words now? You can play any game you want. You said no pseudo-Era Treasures, but you’re surrounding me now. Now what? Use it or not?” Luotian’s eyes held mockery as he gazed at the black heavenly demon umbrella in Nan Gong Liang’s hand. He felt the item was no ordinary pseudo-Era Treasure.

Luotian’s Shangtian Bow had never failed since it was in his hands. With it, countless late-stage Sages had died at his hand.

But this heavenly demon umbrella could block his full-force arrow, leaving only Nan Gong Liang with a mouthful of blood. This showed the umbrella’s terrifying nature.

“Third Elder, lend me your Demon Emperor Tower. Today this little rat must die!” Nan Gong Liang called to an old man nearby.

“Good!” The elder, addressed as Third Elder by Nan Gong Liang, waved his hand. A black small tower flew from the elder’s hand and appeared before Nan Gong Liang. The tower was surrounded by dark mist, appearing hazy.

“Kid, come on! Let’s forget the rule about no pseudo-Era Treasures. Fight with all your might. Today I’ll kill you to avenge our three demon princes!” Nan Gong Liang’s face was filled with killing intent. The black demon tower flew from his hand, pressing toward Luotian.

“Boom….” A thunderous sound echoed. The black demon tower, under Nan Gong Liang’s control, resembled a mountain of demons. Its heavy pressure made people shiver. Luotian’s eyes turned serious.

“Two late-stage Sages with pseudo-Era Treasures. This is Luotian’s first encounter, but he showed no fear. His strength had increased significantly. Though he was a mid-stage Sage, he had three pseudo-Era Treasures. With his strength entering the mid-stage Sage realm, without consuming sacred medicine, he could now draw the Shangtian Bow three times instead of twice.”

“Come on! I’ll see what a late-stage Sage is worth. I’ve killed them before!” Luotian’s eyes were filled with battle spirit. His golden long bow emitted a continuous hum, and the black demon arrow凝聚 (gathered) instantly toward Nan Gong Liang.

Black light shone, the black demon arrow carrying a terrifying aura. It flew toward Nan Gong Liang’s front. At the same time, the mountain-like demon tower was driven by Nan Gong Liang to hover above the sky.

“Get out!” Luotian waved his hand, and a bell’s sound echoed. The Era Bell emerged from his hair, suddenly expanding. Glorious light enveloped Luotian while the massive bell body collided with the black demon tower.

“Crack…” Two loud explosions echoed on the platform, making people’s faces pale.

Luotian spat blood while standing in the glimmering light. His body was radiant, his eyes cautious. On the other side, Nan Gong Liang wasn’t much better. Though the Thousand Mechanisms Heavenly Demon Umbrella had blocked Luotian’s demon arrow, the powerful impact had still injured him.

The people outside were stunned. Their eyes showed disbelief as they gazed at Luotian, surprised that even Nan Gong Liang with two pseudo-Era Treasures couldn’t suppress him. It was too unexpected.

“What is his cultivation? Definitely not an early-stage Sage. They said he would forever stay at the early-stage Sage. Why does his aura feel stronger than a mid-stage Sage?”

“Deceived! He is a mid-stage Sage. He pretended to be an early-stage one, trying to kill the prince Nan Gong Tuo in one strike!” The demon clan members weren’t foolish. Seeing Luotian so fierce, they realized he had been faking weakness. At the crucial moment, he had killed Nan Gong Tuo.

“Despicable!” The demon clan members couldn’t help but curse, even the late-stage Sage elders looked grim. They had also been deceived by Luotian.

“Mid-stage Sage? What does it matter? Your greatest weapon, the Shangtian Bow, can’t harm me. I’m curious how many arrows you can fire. Come on!” Nan Gong Liang wore a mocking expression, addressing Luotian.

“It’s really troublesome! But it doesn’t matter. Even without the Shangtian Bow, I can still kill you!” Luotian’s eyes were filled with battle spirit. He put away the Shangtian Bow, knowing that even if he exhausted himself or ate two sacred medicines, it would only injure Nan Gong Liang. Losing two sacred medicines was too costly.

“Kill!” Thinking this, Luotian held his crackling spear. His black wind flashed as he activated the Yellowscape Ghost Step, appearing like a ghost before Nan Gong Liang. He thrust his spear.

“Buzz…” The black umbrella spun rapidly, forming a dark light screen that blocked Luotian’s attack. At the same time, Nan Gong Liang’s hand slammed toward Luotian.

In a flash, Luotian retreated. He didn’t want to be touched by Nan Gong Liang. After a brief thought, he waved his hand and summoned the Lingyun Vessel.

“Pseudo-Era Treasure? I have more!” Luotian cast out the Lingyun Vessel toward Nan Gong Liang.

“Three pseudo-Era Treasures. Truly, you’re a prodigy relying on external tools!” Nan Gong Liang mocked as he cast out the Thousand Mechanisms Heavenly Demon Umbrella. The black umbrella collided with the Lingyun Vessel repeatedly.

The people around were stunned, watching three battlefields on the platform: the Era Bell and Demon Emperor Tower, the Lingyun Vessel and Heavenly Demon Umbrella. The other side had only Luotian and Nan Gong Liang.

“Kid! Without pseudo-Era Treasures, what else do you have to be arrogant about?” Nan Gong Liang’s hands rapidly changed. Black mist flew from his hands.

“Three Thousand Illusory Demon Bodies!” Nan Gong Liang roared, his aura suddenly surging. At the same time, the Thousand Mechanisms Heavenly Demon Umbrella collided with the Lingyun Vessel, emitting a thunderous sound. Black mist spread from the umbrella.

The black mist slowly gathered and split, forming two thousand dark shadows in people’s sight. Some were grotesque, some crying, others laughing. They floated above the sky.

“One hundred… three hundred…” It grew to two thousand before stopping. Two thousand dark shadows floated above Luotian and Nan Gong Liang, covering the entire sky.

“Three Thousand Illusory Demon Bodies! And it has formed two thousand!” Nan Gong Bo and others’ faces suddenly changed, gazing at the two thousand shadows in the sky.

“What’s wrong? Is there something special about it? It's just a shadow made from demon mist. I don’t think it’s that impressive!” Zheng Xin wore confusion as she addressed Nan Gong Bo.

“Don’t talk nonsense! You don’t understand. It’s said this Three Thousand Illusory Demon Bodies was created by a sage of an ancient era. It’s said that this sage once condensed three thousand demon bodies, roaming the Divine Beast Domain. Even the divine clan would retreat when facing this sage. It was truly terrifying!” Wan Lingkong’s face changed, scolding Zheng Xin.

“Three Thousand Illusory Demon Bodies represent the Dao of three thousand. Each shadow represents a different Dao power. Though it seems simple, each shadow is an attack of the Dao. It’s terrifying! Luotian really faces danger!” Nan Gong Bo wore a worried expression, speaking softly.

Upon hearing Nan Gong Bo’s words, Zheng Xin and Gu Lei fell silent. The attack of Dao power was not something ordinary people could withstand. Three thousand Dais, who could compete? People could imagine how brilliant the demon clan’s sage had been in that era.

Luotian also gazed at the two thousand shadows swirling above with a serious expression. He tightened his grip on the crackling spear.

“Kid! I said you must die today!” Nan Gong Liang’s mouth twisted with cruelty. He pointed his finger, commanding the shadows to attack Luotian.

The thousand and forty-ninth chapter: Dao Sealing Demon()

On the high platform of the demon mountain, two thousand black figures floated in the sky. Each figure radiated a powerful aura, making Luotian’s eyes show seriousness.

Nan Gong Liang wore a cold smile. He pointed his finger, and the two thousand shadows became fierce, roaring toward Luotian.

“Go!” Nan Gong Liang sneered, his voice filled with strong killing intent. He commanded his subjects to kill Luotian.

“Roar…” The two thousand shadows roared, rushing toward Luotian without hesitation. Each one was terrifying.

“Damn!” Luotian’s face darkened as he watched the approaching figures. He cursed under his breath and transformed into a streak of light, flying upward. He was forced to the edge of the barrier again.

“Kill!” Luotian knew there was no escape. His body emitted waves of oceanic sound, and he clashed with the two thousand shadows with his golden crackling spear.

In an instant, the two thousand shadows surrounded Luotian completely. He vanished from their sight.

The thunderous sound echoed, and the shadows attacked Luotian repeatedly. Luotian clearly fought desperately.

His body glowed with golden light, and he seemed like a legendary warrior. His blood and qi were at their peak. The shadows felt the danger of Luotian, but with Nan Gong Liang’s support, they attacked him relentlessly.

The Five Elements Dao, the Time Dao... The Dao power spread, forming a special cycle. It continuously attacked Luotian’s body.

Luotian initially could withstand it, but later the Dao power combined to form more terrifying attacks. Even his powerful physique gradually couldn’t endure, and wounds appeared on his body.

But Luotian, though wounded, wasn’t without effect. In an hour, he had eliminated four hundred and more shadows, giving him a glimpse of hope.

Blood continuously dripped from Luotian’s body. People watching the fierce battle between him and the shadows wore expressions of shock, surprised that Luotian could still endure this long.

On the other side, Nan Gong Liang’s face also turned pale. Though the Three Thousand Illusory Demon Bodies were powerful, they relied on him to sustain them. If too many were destroyed, Nan Gong Liang would also be injured.

The Heaven and Humanity United, the Seven Demon Blades of the Reverse, the Bodhi Attack. Luotian unleashed all his martial arts to their maximum potential. With the Bodhi Attack’s enhancement, the power was immense. Even late-stage Sages felt shocked and fought at their peak, annihilating the shadows with his martial arts.
