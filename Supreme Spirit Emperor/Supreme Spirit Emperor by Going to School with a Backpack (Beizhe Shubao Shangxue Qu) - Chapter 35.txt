Not long after, Lin Zhengyang's figure emerged in the crowd. He dashed to Lu Kunpeng’s side, respectfully presenting a storage pouch into his hands, his face alight with anticipation. It had been ages since he last witnessed Lu Kunpeng’s alchemical furnace being lit; the last time was when he had ascended to the rank of Fourth-Class Alchemist.

“Zhengyang, come with me later!” Lu Kunpeng inspected the herbs within the storage pouch before tossing it to Luo Tian. He spoke to Lin Zhengyang with a smile, clearly taking care of his most cherished disciple.

Lin Zhengyang’s face lit up with joy. Though he knew his talent paled in comparison to Luo Tian’s, he believed diligence could compensate for lack of natural ability. He was certain one day he would surpass Luo Tian in the art of alchemy.

Meanwhile, Gu Yun stood at the entrance of the alchemical chamber, guarding the three to prevent any disturbances during the process.

Luo Tian continuously scrutinized Lu Kunpeng’s alchemical chamber, his admiration growing with each glance. At the center stood a cauldron etched with ancient patterns—undoubtedly an exceptional artifact.

Noticing Luo Tian’s gaze fixed on the cauldron, Lu Kunpeng’s face bore a proud expression. He gently stroked its surface as if caressing his own child. “This cauldron is named the Great Spirit Cauldron (Juling Ding). It has accompanied me for half my life and was a gift from your former master, the previous Grand Hall Leader, when I ascended to Fifth-Class Alchemist.”

“Crafted from celestial meteorite iron refined for forty-nine days, and then—” Lu Kunpeng continued his verbose explanation of the Great Spirit Cauldron, leaving Luo Tian in awe.

Lin Zhengyang’s heart sank with a wry smile. Every time he visited, he inevitably heard the same praises of the Great Spirit Cauldron, deepening his astonishment each time.

Chapter 166: Forging the Body-Refining Pills

Chapter 166: Forging the Body-Refining Pills

Luo Tian’s initial envy turned to irritation as Lu Kunpeng rambled on, clearly showing off.

Gradually, Luo Tian and Lin Zhengyang exchanged glances, both wearing grimaces. Especially Luo Tian, who had never expected Lu Kunpeng to display such a side despite his usual rigor. This only deepened his irritation.

Gu Yun, meanwhile, twitched at the sound of Lu Kunpeng’s endless chatter, his anxiety mounting. Yet he could not interrupt Lu Kunpeng and remained outside, pacing anxiously.

“Fifteen years ago, I once forged a batch of the Supreme Yang Divine Pills…” Upon hearing this, Lin Zhengyang’s face bore a hint of relief.

“Finally over!” Lin Zhengyang whispered to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian pitied Lin Zhengyang, clearly having heard this tale countless times before.

After half an hour of Lu Kunpeng’s monologue, he finally sipped tea, his face regaining composure.

“Seems the master is truly putting effort into this,” Lin Zhengyang murmured, his expression grave.

“Ah?” Luo Tian inquired, turning to Lin Zhengyang.

“When alchemists prepare significant pills, they often feel nervous. Different masters have their own ways to ease this tension. My master’s method is to praise the Great Spirit Cauldron and recount his past achievements,” Lin Zhengyang shrugged, exasperated.

Luo Tian’s lips curled as he listened to Lu Kunpeng’s peculiar habit, speechless.

“Zhengyang! Open the formation!” Lu Kunpeng barked. “Luo Tian, come here and assist me in alchemy!”

Lin Zhengyang obeyed instantly, inserting his identity token into a slot at the door. As the token was placed, the alchemical chamber was enveloped by an array. A discerning observer would have marveled at it being a Fifth-Rank Defensive Array.

Though Luo Tian lacked knowledge of arrays, he knew this one was formidable—superior to the混沌补天阵 (Hunyun Buxian Array) in Dangan Forest.

Before he could ponder further, Lu Kunpeng’s hand released a streak of white flame that surged into the furnace’s mouth.

Luo Tian felt the room’s temperature soar instantly. He was certain that if this flame could melt ordinary Yellow-Rank weapons, it would do so within a single moment.

“Quenched Soul Leaves…” Lu Kunpeng’s cold voice echoed.

Luo Tian wasted no time, retrieving the Quenched Soul Leaves and handing them to Lu Kunpeng.

Before he could catch his breath, Lu Kunpeng flung the leaves into the Great Spirit Cauldron. His voice continued: “Biyun Herb… Thousand-Year Earth Demon Heart…”

The names of herbs flooded Luo Tian’s mind. As the recitation was too slow, Lu Kunpeng directly employed his spiritual sense, making the process astonishingly swift.

Each time Luo Tian heard a name, he rushed to deliver the herbs with lightning speed. Their coordination was terrifying.

Lin Zhengyang watched in awe, witnessing Lu Kunpeng employing his secret technique, the Falling Petal Alchemy Hand, while Luo Tian used the Thousand-Page Brushing Alchemy Hand. Their movements were so fast they defied human eyesight.

Especially Luo Tian—Lin Zhengyang had once assisted Lu Kunpeng before and knew his speed was unparalleled. Yet Luo Tian matched it effortlessly, leaving Lin Zhengyang in stunned disbelief.

“True Dragon Mind Lotus!” As Lu Kunpeng placed the final herb, the True Dragon Mind Lotus, into the Great Spirit Cauldron, Luo Tian’s task was complete.

Only a single moment had passed, yet nearly a hundred herbs were arranged in order within the cauldron.

Lin Zhengyang observed Lu Kunpeng’s fleeting look of admiration and felt a bitter smile on his face, gazing at Luo Tian.

So outstanding—Luo Tian outshone him in every aspect. Though he knew he could never match Luo Tian, the reality of their gap left him with complex emotions.

At one time, his own speed had taken half an hour; Luo Tian had surpassed him by double.

Luo Tian panted heavily, sweat trickling down his face. Lu Kunpeng’s speed had been relentless, leaving him drained in both spiritual sense and physical strength, his arms trembling.

Yet Lu Kunpeng ignored Luo Tian entirely, closing his eyes to probe the herbs within the furnace with his spiritual sense. His expression was grave.

Refining the medicinal liquid was a slow process. Luo Tian understood its importance, holding his breath as he watched Lu Kunpeng intently.

Over a hundred herbs—especially the high-tier ones—posed challenges even for Lu Kunpeng. Under Luo Tian and Lin Zhengyang’s expectant gazes, Lu Kunpeng finally exhaled slowly, his spiritual sense dividing into over a hundred parts to envelop the refined medicinal liquid.

“Refine the pills!” Lu Kunpeng uttered, his breath shallow.

As he barked the command, a thunderous roar echoed from the furnace. Even Luo Tian was stunned by the deafening sound.

“One hour… two hours!” Lu Kunpeng carefully merged the medicinal liquid, his forehead breaking into a sweat. After three hours, he wore an unprecedentedly solemn expression, his face flushed red.

“Roar!” A dragon’s cry echoed from the furnace, followed by another deafening roar from the Great Spirit Cauldron.

“Crash…” A teacup on the nearby table fell to the ground, shattering with a crisp sound.

Yet Luo Tian and Lin Zhengyang were too engrossed to notice, their eyes fixed on the Great Spirit Cauldron before Lu Kunpeng.

“Not good!” A flicker of bitterness crossed Lu Kunpeng’s face.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s low exclamation, Luo Tian and Lin Zhengyang’s hearts trembled. In their stunned gazes, the cauldron’s lid shot upward, colliding with the array’s barrier. A thick cloud of black smoke enveloped the three.

“Cough! Cough!” The trio coughed violently. Lin Zhengyang swiftly opened the door.

Lu Kunpeng waved his hand, and the black smoke exited through the doorway. Gu Yun’s figure appeared before them.

Hearing the explosion, Gu Yun had felt a sinking heart. Now seeing the thick smoke billowing from the alchemical chamber, even a fool would have guessed it was an explosion.

Chapter 167: Dragon’s Blood

Chapter 167: Dragon’s Blood

At the sound of the explosion, Luo Tian knew this batch had failed. He sighed softly and stepped outside, where he found Gu Yun’s face ashen.

Lu Kunpeng wore a faint expression of guilt, his face darkened. He hadn’t expected the Body-Refining Pills to be so difficult to forge; he had been meticulous, yet it still exploded.

“Senior, there’s no need to feel guilty. I know you’ve done your best!” Gu Yun spoke, though his eyes glistened with tears.

The failure of the alchemical pills meant Tian Bo had no chance to recover. How could he not grieve?

“Alas… all is fate,” Lu Kunpeng sighed, lamenting the impending end of a mighty warrior.

“Senior, what caused the explosion?” Luo Tian asked with curiosity.

“Uh…” Lu Kunpeng was taken aback by the question, momentarily forgetting where he had erred.

After a moment of reflection, his face darkened—he couldn’t recall where the mistake had occurred.

“Never mind; it’s failed anyway. If we have enough herbs, perhaps we can try again,” Lu Kunpeng sighed again.

Seeing the three’s gloomy expressions, Luo Tian was puzzled. Why not try another batch?

“You little bastard, it’s easier said than done! Where would we get so many…” Before Lu Kunpeng could speak, Luo Tian casually retrieved the previously taken Thousand-Year Earth Spirit Grass and Ten-Thousand-Year Qingming Branch.

“Uh…” Lu Kunpeng and the others were taken aback, staring at the two herbs Luo Tian placed before them. Their breaths quickened, especially Lu Kunpeng who suddenly felt the True Dragon Mind Lotus he had previously coerced from Luo Tian was slightly insufficient.

“How many more do you have?” Lu Kunpeng asked, his face flushed with red.

“None!” Luo Tian shrugged helplessly, fearing Lu Kunpeng would coerce more from him.

“You!” Lu Kunpeng knew Luo Tian was lying, but having already coerced herbs from him before, he couldn’t bring himself to demand more now. Yet his gaze on Luo Tian was fervent, as if gazing at a mobile herb store.

Luo Tian felt uncomfortable under Lu Kunpeng’s intense gaze and muttered, “Senior Grand Elder, I am a proper young man!”

“Go to hell…” Lu Kunpeng hadn’t expected Luo Tian to say such a thing. He smacked Luo Tian’s head again.

Gu Yun, nearby, stifled his laughter, gazing at Luo Tian with deep gratitude. This youth had given him hope again in his despair.

Lin Zhengyang had already left to prepare the remaining herbs.

Not long after, Lin Zhengyang returned. Under Gu Yun’s expectant gaze, the three re-entered Lu Kunpeng’s alchemical chamber.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed again—this time, an explosion.

Luo Tian casually retrieved herbs from his storage ring and the three rested briefly before resuming alchemy.

Three days passed in a blink, and the thunderous sound echoed from Lu Kunpeng’s alchemical chamber daily.

To Gu Yun, each explosion was a torment; he feared Luo Tian would casually say, “We’re out of herbs.”

But this didn’t happen. Luo Tian never disappointed them; from initial shock to later numbness, they had grown accustomed to his inexhaustible supply of herbs.

“Ha! I’ve found the root cause!”

Lu Kunpeng laughed as he stepped out of the alchemical chamber, his face filled with excitement.

These three days had been torment for Lu Kunpeng as well. He had exploded nearly ten batches of herbs, each rare and consuming countless resources. For someone who valued herbs above all else, this was akin to losing his life.

At the same time, Lu Kunpeng’s gaze on Luo Tian grew even more fervent; he had already made up his mind to extract more from Luo Tian after this.

Luo Tian stood beside Lu Kunpeng, his face showing some joy. To avoid pressuring Lu Kunpeng too much, he concealed that his storage ring had only two remaining batches.

“Master, what was the cause?” Lin Zhengyang asked with reverence, believing his master’s ability to find the answer so quickly was already remarkable.

“Uh…” Upon hearing Lin Zhengyang’s question, Lu Kunpeng felt as if something were lodged in his throat. Thinking of the cause he had discovered, his face shifted from gloom to joy.

“After three days of verification, I believe the issue lies with the Earth Dragon’s Blood!” Lu Kunpeng spoke gravely.

“This True Dragon Mind Lotus, though I don’t know where Luo Tian obtained it, must be of extremely high rank. However, the Earth Dragon’s Blood we used is merely that of a dragon bred by Five Elements Sect. It pales in comparison to true dragons. Do you understand now?” Lu Kunpeng explained to the three.

Upon hearing this, Luo Tian and the others needed no further explanation—they understood the issue was the True Dragon Mind Lotus’s high rank. The Earth Dragon’s Blood was utterly ineffective against it.

Gu Yun finally let out a bitter smile; he hadn’t expected the failure to stem from the True Dragon Mind Lotus’s high rank.

“Then, Senior, do you know of a way to resolve this?” Luo Tian asked with reluctant determination.

“Time is pressing; only if we find a dragon’s blood higher than Earth Dragon’s can there be a chance. Of course, if I had more time, perhaps I could think of other methods,” Lu Kunpeng shook his head.

Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with disappointment. He knew where the True Dragon Mind Lotus had come from—true dragons. On Tianyuan Continent, there were no more than five dragon lairs; only the blood of Longjian and his wife could work.

But how long would it take to travel from here to Dangan Forest? And Luo Tian couldn’t bear to ask Longjian and his wife again, having already taken so much from them.

For a moment, the scene fell into silence. Gu Yun had completely given up; dragons were truly hard to find.

“Continue alchemy! Let me try my blood!” As the three were dejected, Luo Tian’s voice softly echoed.

Chapter 168: The Pill Grows with Thunder

Chapter 168: The Pill Grows with Thunder

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the three stared at him in disbelief, unsure of his meaning.

“I once used dragon’s blood to refine my body,” Luo Tian explained, seeing their confusion.

But this statement sent a tidal wave through the three. Dragon’s blood—Lu Kunpeng had spoken of it as true dragons, even higher.

Yet Luo Tian suggested Lu Kunpeng use his blood instead. What rank of dragon’s blood had Luo Tian used to refine his body?

Upon hearing this, Lu Kunpeng and the others scrutinized Luo Tian closely. This was no ordinary man; Lu Kunpeng, having lived for centuries and being the Grand Elder of the Alchemy Hall, could sense Luo Tian’s transformation.

Lu Kunpeng could clearly feel Luo Tian had reached the eighth rank of body refinement, yet his aura was barely distinguishable from that of a bone-formation stage.

“You!” Lu Kunpeng’s face bore disbelief, speechless at Luo Tian.

“Just some opportunities related to dragons in Dangan Forest,” Luo Tian said lightly, seeing their expressions as if gazing at a monster.

“Only that!”

Lu Kunpeng, trusting Luo Tian, could think of no other solution. He nodded slightly and spoke.

The three were people of action, taking a brief rest before re-entering the alchemical chamber.

Time flew; within an hour, Lu Kunpeng had extracted all herbs. He glanced at Luo Tian slightly: “Come, it’s your turn!”

Luo Tian’s expression was grave. He nodded and pricked his finger, a drop of blood flying from it. Unlike ordinary blood, this had a faint golden hue.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian’s blood flew out, Lu Kunpeng and Lin Zhengyang felt a pressure upon them. This was not a spiritual pressure but one of bloodline.

Deep within the Five Elements Sect, the three earth dragons raised their heads, fear in their eyes. They trembled and roared toward Lu Kunpeng’s alchemical chamber, as if paying homage to their ruler.

“What’s happening!” A senior who had fed the three earth dragons for years asked in a low voice.

The three earth dragons had gained sentience; they often communicated with these elders. Yet now, no matter how the elder questioned them, the dragons merely crouched on the ground, emitting low roars.

As pressure mounted, Luo Tian’s blood fell into the furnace. To ensure it was enough, he conjured another drop of blood and sent it into the Great Spirit Cauldron.

Lu Kunpeng was momentarily stunned, unsure how Luo Tian’s blood had transformed thus. He focused entirely on refining the two drops of blood that entered the Great Spirit Cauldron.

The more he refined, the more astonished he became. Ordinary earth dragon’s blood could be refined in a single breath, yet these two drops had only been one-third refined after his prolonged effort.

His face was solemn as he devoted himself to the process of forging the Body-Refining Pills.

Luo Tian’s face was pale; blood was not like ordinary blood. He knew his entire blood supply could not refine more than fifteen drops, and two had already taken a toll on him.

The thunderous sound echoed again in the alchemical chamber. Gu Yun outside prayed fervently; this was his last hope. If it failed again, there would be no solution.

Time passed; Lu Kunpeng’s face grew pale. The toll of days had taken its effect, even on a bone-formation peak powerhouse.

“One hour… two hours…”

After three hours, Lu Kunpeng suddenly opened his eyes. The Five Elements Qi of the entire alchemy hall surged into this small courtyard.

Feeling the intense qi fluctuation, Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy—he knew this batch might succeed.

But Lu Kunpeng, sensing the qi pouring into the Great Spirit Cauldron, did not relax but grew more solemn.

“Grand Elder is forging what pills? Why is the qi flowing toward his courtyard!” The alchemy hall’s people felt the direction of the qi fluctuation, speculating what pills Lu Kunpeng was forging.

“Certainly a Fifth-Rank or higher!” Some elders wore solemn expressions.

Yet before they could react, the sky darkened with clouds, rushing toward the peak of the alchemy hall. Thunderous sounds echoed clearly, and people could feel the destructive power within the lightning.

“This is a pill thunder!”
“Grand Elder is forging Sixth-Rank pills!”
“Judging by the lightning’s appearance, it must be a Two-Element Thunder!” The alchemy hall’s disciples could not sit still, their eyes wide with shock.

At this moment, Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian naturally felt the changes in the sky. Luo Tian had never seen a pill thunder before, but he had read about it in the alchemy hall’s records. His face grew solemn.

Lu Kunpeng also wore a grim expression; he hadn’t expected his pills to form a thunder, let alone a Two-Element Thunder.

He thought back and sighed. Previously, he had only formed a Single-Element Pill Thunder, which he barely managed to handle with the alchemical chamber’s array and his strength. That single thunder had solidified his position as Grand Elder of the Alchemy Hall.

“Luo Tian, take Zhengyang and Gu Yun away!” Lu Kunpeng conveyed through spiritual sense.

Luo Tian heard Lu Kunpeng’s mental transmission and frowned slightly, shouting at Lin Zhengyang: “Quickly take Gu Elder away from here!”

Lin Zhengyang was startled by Luo Tian’s shout. After a moment, he gazed deeply at Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian before leaving the door, pulling Gu Yun who was in a daze toward the distance. His eyes were filled with intense tension, watching the alchemical chamber.

“Grand Elder, perhaps it’s better to give up!” Luo Tian advised.

“Give up? Impossible! This Two-Element Thunder—what kind of pills must emerge to be so extraordinary. Old man will see!” Lu Kunpeng’s face bore a resolute expression.

Chapter 169: Fighting the Thunder

Chapter 169: Fighting the Thunder

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, Luo Tian wore a wry smile. He knew of Lu Kunpeng’s obsession with alchemy and admired him, yet he sighed, knowing it was difficult to convince this old stubborn man to abandon the Body-Refining Pills. He had only hoped for a glimmer of chance.

Feeling the terrifying fluctuations in the sky, Luo Tian truly wanted to flee. Yet he couldn’t—he wasn’t just helping Lu Kunpeng forge the pills for Gu Yun, but also because of Lu Kunpeng’s kindness over the years and his contributions to the alchemy hall. He couldn’t leave.

“Luo Tian, you must go! Once the pills are out, the thunder will descend immediately. I won’t have time to protect you!” Lu Kunpeng grew anxious, seeing Luo Tian still standing.

“Don’t worry; I can protect myself!” Luo Tian’s face bore determination as he conveyed mentally.

“Good! The Grand Elder truly didn’t misjudge you! Today, I’ll risk my life to protect this kid!” Lu Kunpeng’s face showed a touch of emotion.

The rolling clouds descended lower, and people could clearly see the dragons of lightning writhing within them. They roared, waiting for their descent.

“Pill Forging!” Lu Kunpeng barked, his aged hand striking the Great Spirit Cauldron.

“Wum…” The pill, having absorbed infinite qi, burst from the Great Spirit Cauldron and flew out as three dark lights.

Lu Kunpeng, true to his name, moved strangely, like a great peng bird, leaping into the air. His hand waved, capturing the three pills and placing them in a jade vial.

“Pang…” Lu Kunpeng landed firmly on the ground, his face showing joy.

But soon after, he wore a grim expression, looking up at the roof with solemn words: “It’s here!”

Before Lu Kunpeng could finish speaking, a lightning dragon roared toward the alchemical chamber in people’s stunned gazes.

“Too terrifying! I feel like there’s no chance of survival under this lightning dragon!” A disciple at the ninth rank of body refinement said, his face filled with fear.

“Can Grand Elder withstand it?” Another disciple asked nervously.

But the answer was silence and eyes filled with worry.

“Sixth-Rank pills! This Lu Kunpeng has forged a pill thunder again. That old man is truly remarkable!” Other peak leaders marveled, naturally knowing the one forging the pills was Lu Kunpeng.

Wudou Peak’s leader Wu Taiping and Qingmu Peak’s leader Mu Nianqing had arrived at the alchemy hall. They weren’t here to witness this Sixth-Rank pill thunder but to inquire about their disciples, Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue.

Gu Yun’s face bore bitterness; he naturally knew about the pill thunder but hadn’t expected to witness it. His eyes showed worry—two people who had done much for Gu Family were now facing the terrifying thunder. This made him feel helpless.

Gu Yun felt useless; he couldn’t protect his wife or children, and now had to let the family’s benefactors face this terrifying thunder. His thoughts grew more bitter, and with the pressure of these events, he spat blood from his mouth.

Lin Zhengyang didn’t notice Gu Yun’s unexpectedness because the lightning dragon had already slammed into the alchemical chamber’s array, producing a deafening sound.

Lin Zhengyang didn’t notice that Gu Yun’s chest had a glowing mark flickering faintly.

At this moment, all the alchemy hall disciples focused on the thick lightning dragon.

“Crack…” The crisp sound exploded in Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian’s ears, shattering the four-rank array on the alchemical chamber in three breaths.

After breaking through the array, the lightning dragon paused slightly before lifting the alchemical chamber’s roof and crushing toward Lu Kunpeng, as if it had sensed the scent of the Body-Refining Pills in his storage bag.

Lu Kunpeng’s face was solemn, three green qi shields appearing above him instantly. Then he swung a sword with霸道 (domineering) intent toward the lightning.

“Boom…” The alchemical chamber couldn’t withstand the impact, being reduced to ruins. Lu Kunpeng’s battered figure appeared in people’s sight.

At this moment, Lu Kunpeng’s face was pale, his feet deeply embedded in the ground. A pool of blood lay before him, and that sword, seemingly of high rank, had been reduced to nothing by the thunder.

Luo Tian merely stood nearby, but his face was grim; even the residual energy had caused his internal qi to shake uncontrollably.

“Blocked!” The alchemy hall disciples erupted into deafening cheers, their eyes filled with fanaticism toward the pale figure.

This was a godlike presence in their hearts, now battling against thunder. Though battered, he had held it back.

Lu Kunpeng didn’t have time to think; he quickly swallowed a pill, his pale face instantly returning to peak condition.

His eyes darkened again as he gazed at the sky, where the clouds had not disappeared but grown denser. He sighed softly: “One more trial!”

“Two-Element Thunder! This second thunder is stronger than the first by more than double! Grand Elder has already exhausted himself defending the first. How can he defend this second?” Several elders wore worry, gazing at the thunder about to descend.

Lu Kunpeng’s heart trembled; this second thunder made even his bone-formation peak strength feel powerless. He could clearly sense that if it fell, both he and Luo Tian would be reduced to nothing.

The only solution was to throw out the Body-Refining Pills, letting them be destroyed by the thunder. But Lu Kunpeng couldn’t bear to part with it. He whispered to Luo Tian: “Luo Tian, run quickly! I might not be able to protect you this time. This Two-Element Thunder is too terrifying!”

Luo Tian chuckled and shook his head, saying softly: “Grand Elder, please continue. Don’t worry about me!”

“You little bastard!” Lu Kunpeng was about to run toward Luo Tian and throw him out. If he died, it wouldn’t matter, but if Luo Tian died because of his actions, how could he face the Grand Elder of the alchemy hall?

“If necessary, we’ll have to abandon this Body-Refining Pill!” Lu Kunpeng sighed.

“There’s still hope!” Luo Tian’s face bore a determined look. He waved his hand, and a bronze cauldron appeared before them.

Chapter 170: The Domineering Zhen Hun Cauldron

Chapter 170: The Domineering Zhen Hun Cauldron

The bronze cauldron emitted a deep sound as it landed before Lu Kunpeng, who was stunned.

“This!” Lu Kunpeng stared at the astonishing cauldron, speechless for a moment.

“Try using this to block it!” Luo Tian spoke, hoping to test his luck. He had no idea what else he could use to withstand the thunder’s power, and this Zhen Hun Cauldron was undoubtedly the best choice.

Though his spear, Lie Tian, was also formidable, it had recognized Luo Tian as its master and wouldn’t obey Lu Kunpeng.

At this moment, the thunderous sound in the sky rang again. A lightning dragon, thicker and stronger than before, roared with arrogance, looking down on Lu Kunpeng like an ant.

“Let’s try!” Lu Kunpeng’s face was solemn. Though he had some life-saving items, he felt none were as effective as the mysterious bronze cauldron Luo Tian had produced.

He approached the Zhen Hun Cauldron and, under Luo Tian’s watchful gaze, slowly extended his arms to embrace it.

Luo Tian’s heart drummed; he wasn’t sure if Lu Kunpeng could lift this incredibly heavy cauldron. Five top-tier sects’ geniuses had failed to lift it before, and now he was gambling everything on this. If they won, both their lives would be safe; if not, both would perish.

The other disciples of the alchemy hall also looked at Luo Tian’s bronze cauldron with confusion, their faces showing bewilderment. They didn’t know what Luo Tian was up to.

Lu Kunpeng’s arms strained slightly, expecting it to be easy to lift. Yet the bronze cauldron remained unmoved.

“Hmph?” Lu Kunpeng let out a soft sound, then exerted more strength. His bone-formation peak power was fully activated. Under Luo Tian’s excitement, the bronze cauldron soared into the sky.

At this moment, the thick lightning dragon descended again, colliding directly with the Zhen Hun Cauldron.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed again. Luo Tian felt as if his body was no longer his, with blood gushing from his ears, nose, and mouth. His face turned pale without a trace of color.

Lu Kunpeng was no better off; after throwing the cauldron, he had exhausted all his strength. If it weren’t for his bone-formation peak physique, he would have been in the same state as Luo Tian.

Though Lu Kunpeng was somewhat better, he felt his bones were about to break apart.

Yet both of them watched the Zhen Hun Cauldron bathed in lightning, silently praying that if it couldn’t withstand the Two-Element Thunder, they would both perish.

But to their surprise, when the lightning dragon touched the Zhen Hun Cauldron, it was intercepted. The cauldron itself, a deep green one, appeared somewhat translucent under the pill thunder.

The immense lightning power was unexpectedly absorbed into the cauldron and vanished.

“Pang…” The Zhen Hun Cauldron landed firmly on the ground with a震撼 (shocking) sound.

The clouds in the sky disappeared instantly, revealing gentle sunlight. In just a moment, the Two-Element Thunder had been blocked.

Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng had recovered by taking pills during the brief interval, their faces filled with shock at the mysterious Zhen Hun Cauldron. It was truly unfathomable.

So heavy it was, and yet it could absorb thunder—like thunder was its food. How could one believe this?

But the facts were right before their eyes.

Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng panted heavily, sweat trickling down their faces. The experience had been too intense; they were lucky to have gambled correctly, otherwise neither would have survived the terrifying thunder.

“Blocked!” Lin Zhengyang’s face showed joy. The Two-Element Thunder was so precious; the Five Elements Sect hadn’t seen it in years. And now, it had been forged by his master, with him participating—how could he not be excited?

“Grand Elder! Glory!” Someone led the cheer.

The entire alchemy hall erupted into a powerful cheer, even the newly arrived Wudou Peak leader and Qingmu Peak leader wore admiration on their faces. Lu Kunpeng’s ability to withstand the thunder proved he had taken a step toward the Yuanling realm.

Lu Kunpeng gazed at the ancient bronze cauldron, his face showing rare greed. He asked Luo Tian: “Luo Tian, what is this cauldron’s name?”

“Zhen Hun Cauldron!” Luo Tian smiled lightly, gazing at Lu Kunpeng. But upon seeing Lu Kunpeng’s face filled with greed, he hesitated slightly.

“This cauldron, at your current strength, is unlikely to be fully utilized. Let me keep it for you first; when you can harness its power, come retrieve it from me!” Lu Kunpeng rubbed his hands and negotiated with Luo Tian.
