“Are you threatening us, the demon clan?” Three elders spoke, sealing off the two elders’ escape routes with cold eyes.

“We dare not! We dare not!” The elders of the如意宗 and 四象楼 trembled with fear, shaking their heads rapidly.

“Please do not blame us. We have offended you; may your compassion be shown for the sake of our shared status as sects within the Divine and Demon Domain. Spare us this time!” The two elders bowed deeply, immediately kneeling before the Demon Lord. They knew only the highest demon authority’s words could grant them a chance of escape.

“Old demon, it seems your clan’s roots in the Divine and Demon Domain are not as solid as they appear,” Shura Domain’s Lord Yan Xiuluo spoke, his eyes gleaming with amusement.

“Out of respect for your status as Divine and Demon Domain sects, you shall strike yourselves until Nan Gong Bo is satisfied,” the Demon Lord declared, finally setting the punishment.

“Hmph!” The two elders’ faces darkened. To be forced to strike themselves in front of so many people was utterly humiliating.

“Does this mean you dare defy the Demon Lord’s words? Should we assist you?” Seeing their brief hesitation, the three demon elders erupted in anger, raising massive hands to strike their faces.

“Crack!” Three sharp sounds echoed through the crowd as the two elders were hurled into the demon arena.

“Elders!” The followers of如意宗 and 四象楼 watched their elders being thrown aside, their faces pale. Not a single soul moved—neither the other peak sage elder dared to act.

“Cough… cough…” The two elders rose, their faces flushed red with the imprint of hands.

“Remember the force? Hit yourself until Nan Gong Bo is satisfied!” The three peak sage elders loomed over them, their voices cold.

“Dominance!” People marveled at the three demon elders’ strength. For years, the demon clan had rarely shown their might, giving the impression they were weak. Thus, other sects had gradually dismissed them.

But today, the demon clan proved with action that they were not weak. Anyone daring to provoke them would be crushed.

“Yes… yes…” The two elders blushed crimson, glaring at Nan Gong Bo’s smiling face. They longed to strike him down but dared not. If they killed him, it would be more than just a loss of face.

They could not even kill him; they had to strike themselves, ensuring this man’s satisfaction. After all, he held their fates in his hands. If Nan Gong Bo refused to relent, with the force of the three demon elders, they would eventually die from their own blows.

“Crack!” The two men gathered strength and began striking themselves in front of millions of demon disciples, the heads of major sects across the Divine and Demon Domain, and each domain’s lords and princes.

One strike. Two strikes. Each resounded in the ears, their blows filled with force as if their heads would be torn off. Cracks formed on their skulls.

“Ten strikes… a hundred…” The two elders felt their minds were no longer their own, yet Nan Gong Bo remained smiling, unmoving.

“Nan Gong Sect Leader, are you truly intending to let these two die from their own blows?” The demon clan’s people wore excited expressions, gazing at Nan Gong Bo.

Today was the most glorious moment for the demon clan in years. Previously, sects like如意宗 and 四象楼 had outwardly respected the demon clan but secretly plotted against them.

The demon disciples knew that after this, their clan would reclaim its former dominance in the Divine and Demon Domain, extinguishing any lingering hopes of those scheming sects.

“Boom!” After enduring the immense force for long, the two elders could no longer withstand it. Their heads exploded, blood splattering across the arena.

Nan Gong Bo watched their heads shatter and spoke softly: “You may stop now.”

Regenerating, the two elders stood before the crowd, their faces pale from severe injuries.

“Thank you,” they bowed to Nan Gong Bo, their expressions grim as they returned to their sects.

“Thank you for your intervention, Elders! I have just returned to the demon clan and have yet to contribute a single achievement. These three pseudo-era treasures I now submit to the sect!” Nan Gong Bo addressed the three peak sage elders above, raising his hand. The three pseudo-era treasures previously used by Nan Gong Yuan flew toward the elders.

“Damn it! This is blatant bribery!” Some remaining elders who resented Nan Gong Bo muttered in anger.

“You’ve chosen a very diplomatic leader,” some domain lords smiled at the Demon Lord, their voices carrying admiration.

Nan Gong Bo had not offered the pseudo-era treasures to the Demon Lord but directly to the three peak sage elders. This was clearly bribery; after all, the Demon Lord rarely intervened in affairs. These three elders, though not entirely involved, still cared for the demon clan, so it was better to give them directly.

“Ha! Excellent. Rarely have you shown such initiative. We’ll keep these three pseudo-era treasures for now; whoever serves the demon clan in the future will be rewarded!” The three elders’ eyes gleamed, taking the treasures and returning to the Demon Lord’s side.

“Luo Tian!” The forces of如意宗 and 四象楼 glared at Luo Tian with intense hatred, blaming him for all their disgrace.

After all, if it weren’t for Luo Tian lending his pseudo-era treasures to Nan Gong Bo, the outcome today would not have been this way. There would be no subsequent events or disgrace for their sects.

Furious killing intent surged toward Luo Tian. If this were not the demon clan, their sects would have already attacked.

“Damn it!” Feeling the overwhelming killing intent from the two sects’ four peak sage elders, Luo Tian and his companions felt their bodies press under immense pressure. Their faces darkened as they gazed at the two sects.

Though the two sects had acted discreetly, they had forgotten about a more terrifying presence than the three peak sage elders—Luo Tian’s group was under constant watch by Biao Yuanshan, seated beside the Demon Lord.

Long ancestor Long Jie’s grandson Biao Dezu was with Luo Tian. How could Biao Yuanshan not pay attention? They were his most precious treasures.

When the two sects’ killing intent surged toward Luo Tian’s group, Biao Yuanshan sensed it. His gaze turned to the direction of the two sects.

Yet Biao Yuanshan did not act immediately but glanced at the Demon Lord, knowing he too had felt the killing intent on Luo Tian’s group.

“Alas, they sought their own demise. No one else is to blame,” the Demon Lord smiled, still watching Nan Gong Bo on the arena.

Biao Yuanshan furrowed his brow slightly but then nodded to the Demon Lord. A half-era debt of gratitude was worth it for securing an advantage over Luo Tian, Long Jie, and Biao Dezu.

“Alas, you two sects are in for trouble. I didn’t warn you enough,” Yan Xiuluo spoke to the two sects.

“Huh?” As Yan Xiuluo’s words echoed, people turned puzzled eyes toward the great powers above.

The two sects’ members also wore confusion, momentarily failing to grasp Yan Xiuluo’s meaning. They didn’t understand which two sects he referred to.

But in the next instant, the two sects were speechless, their eyes filled with intense fear as they gazed at the slowly rising purple figure.

“Cough… cough…” In their daze, Luo Tian’s group also broke free from the overwhelming killing intent of the four peak sage elders.

“Grandpa, my grandson was almost killed. Help me avenge him!” Biao Dezu shouted toward the purple figure above, his voice filled with exaggerated委屈. People’s mouths twitched.

“I’ve already said before: if this happens again, your sect will no longer exist. It seems you truly don’t respect me Biao Yuanshan!” Biao Yuanshan’s voice was cold, but he did not leave his seat. Instead, he struck two hands into the air.

“Boom… boom…” Purple hands, like heavenly might, cast an immense pressure that made people’s hearts tremble. All bowed their heads in fear, watching Biao Yuanshan’s seemingly light strike.

“Those are the Four Symbols Pavilion and如意宗!” People gasped, watching where the two purple hands fell.

“Flee!” The two sects’ people panicked, their faces filled with fear. Facing a half-era power, they had no chance of resistance. Their bodies flew toward all directions.

“Return!” Biao Yuanshan’s eyes were cold, his voice soft. He spoke as if a king of a domain, and his words took effect.

As the words fell, the two sects’ people had not yet escaped when they were instantly frozen in place. Their bodies felt unresponsive, eyes filled with endless fear as the purple hands descended upon them.

“Boom… boom…” The two hands struck the two sects’ people directly, shaking the entire demon mountain.

In an instant, the two sects’ people—including four peak sage elders—were annihilated by Biao Yuanshan’s single strike.

“You may continue!” Biao Yuanshan sat down slowly, addressing the three dazed peak sage elders.

The Demon Lord nodded lightly, entirely indifferent to what had just transpired. He signaled the three elders to continue.

“Challenge continues! Anyone who doubts Nan Gong Bo may step onto the arena!” One elder cleared his throat, his voice echoing across the demon mountain. People’s gazes returned to the arena.

Nan Gong Bo smiled, scanning over the elders who had previously been eager to challenge.

Unlike before, every elder Nan Gong Bo’s gaze fell upon lowered their heads immediately—daring not to ascend.

At this point, Nan Gong Bo’s position as sect leader was already sealed. They had no chance of victory.

In terms of strength, they were inferior to Nan Gong Bo. Even if stronger, with three pseudo-era treasures on him, anyone who challenged would be doomed. In terms of connections, the example of Four Symbols Pavilion and如意宗 was clear.

“Alas,” Nan Gong Bo sighed, surprised they had submitted so quickly. His intention was to kill more.

Time passed slowly; the incense burned out completely, and three peak sage elders appeared before Nan Gong Bo again.

“Since no one challenges, Nan Gong Bo shall remain the demon clan’s leader. Whoever disobeys us three will not escape!” The three elders’ voices rang out with authority, causing the demon clan’s disciples and elders to tremble.

“Hail the Sect Leader!” Millions of disciples spoke in unison, their voices piercing the sky. Their eyes carried respect as they bowed to Nan Gong Bo.

Though some elders were reluctant, the situation was sealed. There was no chance of reversal now. They were not thinking about how to wrest the sect leader position from Nan Gong Bo but rather what kind of purges he would carry out after becoming leader.

“Thank you all!” Nan Gong Bo laughed, reciting his prepared speech about loyalty to the demon clan and future development directions. Then he exited the arena.

“Finally over!” Luo Tian’s group sighed deeply, watching Nan Gong Bo and Nan Gong Yuqing respectfully standing behind the Demon Lord. Their hearts felt at ease.

The demon clan’s ritual was complete with the confirmation of its leader, but no one left. Their faces carried anticipation as they gazed at the still-unretracted arena, finally turning to Luo Tian, Yan Xiuluo, and Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Everyone must have heard that besides the ritual, each domain’s lord also brought their domains’ elites to our demon clan. The lords discussed it and wanted the young talents from each domain to exchange cultivation insights. Thus, this ritual also includes a competition among these elites!” Nan Gong Bo stepped into the crowd’s view. As the demon clan leader, he had to organize this after confirming his position.

“Rumors…” The entire demon mountain echoed with murmurs. People’s eyes carried anticipation. Compared to the competition for the sect leader, they were more interested in these elites’ battles. These collisions could produce a candidate for the era’s master, and they needed to cultivate connections.

“Alright, give each domain one hour to discuss who is suitable for this competition! Of course, they may also choose to withdraw!” Nan Gong Bo continued.

“Chaos Domain, Zhu Ge Huangchao!” As Nan Gong Bo’s words ended, Zhu Ge Huangchao shouted and appeared on the arena. His eyes carried endless arrogance.

“That’s Chaos Domain’s Zhu Ge Huangchao. I heard he once clashed with Yan Xiuluo of the Shura Domain and did not fall behind!” People sighed, gazing at Zhu Ge Huangchao wrapped in gray aura.

“Shura Domain, Yan Xiuluo!”

“Starry Sky Domain, Zhou Wei!”

“Divine and Demon Domain, Sun Feiwen!” As Zhu Ge Huangchao stood on the arena, three figures leapt up and appeared there.

“Four peak domains’ princes have arrived. Sun Feiwen is not the strongest in the Divine and Demon Domain, but he represents it well. I heard the strongest talent of the Divine and Demon Domain is the divine girl of the deity clan, Tai Chu body Sun Mengru!” People murmured as they watched the figures on the arena.

“Beast Domain, Long Jie!” The aura of the imperial dragon filled the air. Long Jie’s figure appeared before everyone, his youthful face but his aura matching Yan Xiuluo and others.

“Long Jie is the reincarnation of Long Zhan Tian. Indeed, he’s strong!” The six domain lords sitting high up wore interested expressions as they observed Long Jie.

“Long Ancestor, breaking through and fully awakening the dragon clan’s bloodline. It’s equivalent to living a second life! How could he not be strong!” Biao Yuanshan wore a proud expression, gazing at Long Jie.

As Long Jie stood on the arena, people finally turned their gaze to Luo Tian, waiting for his appearance.

“Four Symbols Star Domain, Luo Tian!” Luo Tian pushed off the ground with a fierce battle spirit, stepping onto the arena. To fight against elites was clearly bold for him, and he represented the Four Symbols Star Domain.

“Reincarnation Body, Luo Tian, Prince Killer!” People’s eyes gleamed with excitement as they watched Luo Tian step onto the arena.

Luo Tian’s reputation was poor, but his strength was undeniable. His hands were stained with the blood of many sects’ princes and elders, proving his journey through bloody facts. No one could deny he was no ordinary person; others would have died countless times.

As Luo Tian stood on the arena, six people’s auras surged. Their gazes met, colliding with powerful battle spirit.

“Old demon, don’t let that kid behind you challenge?” The deity clan’s god king spoke to the Demon Lord, glancing at Nan Gong Yuqing behind him.

“Not yet. He will accompany me in cultivation for a while. When he emerges, he can compete with them,” the Demon Lord replied, declining the god king’s suggestion.

“Hmph?” The three peak sage elders’ faces slightly trembled, gazing at the Demon Lord. They had not expected him to value Nan Gong Yuqing so highly.

“Nine domains have arrived except for the Thunder Domain and the Mortal Domain!” People murmured, gazing at Luo Tian’s six.

“Precisely, only the Thunder and Mortal Domains are missing. You know Luo Tian can represent both the Fire Domain and Four Symbols Star Domain simultaneously!” Someone countered.

“But why hasn’t the Thunder Domain arrived? In this grand occasion, the Thunder Domain is weak but shouldn’t lack even a prince!” Someone spoke.

“You don’t know, right? The Thunder Domain’s prince was killed and captured by Luo Tian. That Thunder Domain prince is still in Luo Tian’s hands. Also, I heard the Thunder Domain recently had some issues—some faction entered it, causing much trouble for the Thunder Domain’s ruler, Thunder Sect,” people sighed.

“Fine, the Thunder Domain is just a minor one. It can’t produce anyone with qualifications anyway. At most, it’s comparable to the ordinary sects of the Divine and Demon Domain,” people spoke dismissively, discussing the Thunder Domain.

“Come on, draw lots!” Nan Gong Bo smiled and addressed Luo Tian’s six.

“No need to draw lots. I’m here for Luo Tian. They’re not worth my interest!” Zhu Ge Huangchao gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with excitement.

“You’re nothing. To fight my brother, first pass through me!” Long Jie rebuked, his overwhelming pressure sweeping over Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Don’t worry, I’ll take them,” Zhu Ge Huangchao looked at Long Jie as if he were a beast.

“Die!” Long Jie, provoked by Zhu Ge Huangchao’s provocation, was furious. His body emitted roaring dragon sounds and rushed toward Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Long Jie, follow the rules!” Luo Tian grabbed Long Jie and took a bamboo stick from Nan Gong Bo’s hand.

“Hmph, don’t let me meet you!” Long Jie coldly snorted, his eyes icy. He followed Luo Tian and grabbed.

“Kid, you’ve raised your head too high; falling will hurt a lot!” Yan Xiuluo sneered, taking a bamboo stick.

Zhou Wei and Sun Feiwen also took bamboo sticks from Nan Gong Bo’s hand, but their eyes carried ill intent toward Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“None fear!” Zhu Ge Huangchao boasted, grabbing the last bamboo stick in his hand.

“One vs. Six, Two vs. Five, Three vs. Four!” Nan Gong Bo announced the rules.

“I’m Four,” Zhu Ge Huangchao was impatient, gazing at the others.

“Um… I think I’m Four,” Luo Tian looked at his bamboo stick, a large four appearing in people’s view.

“Haha! It was effortless!” Zhu Ge Huangchao laughed, throwing his bamboo stick and stepping out of the six’s circle. Gray chaos holy power spread around him as he pulled a gray long sword from it, his eyes filled with excitement toward Luo Tian.

“I’m Two!” Yan Hongtao looked disappointed, gazing at Sun Feiwen and others. He felt regret for not drawing Zhu Ge Huangchao, as he truly wanted to teach him a lesson.

“I curse! I’m Five!” Sun Feiwen shouted, looking at his bamboo stick and Yan Hongtao with intense suspicion.

Long Jie and Zhou Wei exchanged glances, their eyes filled with regret. They sighed and moved to the side.

Three peak sage elders again unleashed power, expanding the arena significantly. They also used barriers to divide it into three areas.

“Luo Tian, I’ve waited for this day a long time. Today, I will break your legend and crush you underfoot, shattering your invincible heart!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face was filled with battle spirit. His blood surged, and his battle spirit reached its peak.

“You might scare me a little if it were your brother. But you? You lack the qualification!” Luo Tian immediately activated his demon state, black demon swords凝聚 in his hand.

“Enough talk. Fight!” Zhu Ge Huangchao moved, transforming into a cloud of gray mist and rushing toward Luo Tian. He appeared before him, slashing downward with his gray long sword, cutting through space and emitting a humming sound.

At the moment Zhu Ge Huangchao moved, Luo Tian’s face slightly tensed. He moved like lightning and raised his third sword of the Seven Demon Blades, colliding with Zhu Ge Huangchao’s gray long sword.

The other four also attacked simultaneously. Long Jie faced Zhou Wei, Yan Hongtao faced Sun Feiwen. Including Luo Tian and two others, the six had默契 without using pseudo-era treasures. They fought with martial arts and physical strength alone. They knew this battle was about an invincible mindset. If anyone used pseudo-era treasures, their invincible mindset would weaken. Even if they lost, they would fall with dignity and could later compete with others.

The sound of collision echoed throughout the arena. Blood surged, three areas, and six people began immediately creating a massive wave.

“Powerful!” People marveled at the six battling, their eyes filled with awe.

“This six fought without pseudo-era treasures. Their collision waves were no less than the previous one when Nan Gong Bo defeated Nan Gong Sheng,” people murmured.

“Moreover, previously the demon clan’s sect leader Nan Gong Bo defeated Nan Gong Sheng with three punches. The second match was won by pseudo-era treasures, so there was no suspense. This six’s punches and kicks were flesh-to-flesh, with no huge gap in strength. Thus, it was more entertaining!” People discussed as they watched the six battling, each area echoing with collisions, making people dazzled.

“Chaos Mortal Sword!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face was serious. His gray long sword continuously slashed, emitting a decayed气息 toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian opened wide and unleashed the Seven Demon Blades, black sword light colliding with Zhu Ge Huangchao’s long sword.

In a blink, they clashed thirty times, evenly matched. Each clash left scars on the arena.

“Hearing your body is unmatched, today I wish to witness it!” Zhu Ge Huangchao, seeing they couldn’t resolve the battle quickly, finally put his sword away and waved his hands. Gray seal patterns formed from his hands, eventually merging into his body.

“Chaos Nine Transformations, Eighth Transformation!” Zhu Ge Huangchao whispered, his body emitting thunderous sounds. The overwhelming chaos holy power enveloped him.

“Chaos Nine Transformations! This kid has reached the eighth transformation of Chaos Domain’s Mortal Nine Transformations. Such talent is truly astonishing!” Six domain lords wore expressions of admiration.

“It’s Chaos Domain’s Chaos Nine Transformations. Legend says if one reaches the ninth transformation, it can rival the nine bodies’ flesh! It’s a complete nine-body!” People wore expressions of awe, gazing at Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Indeed, he has the arrogance to back it up!” Luo Tian narrowed his eyes. He could feel Zhu Ge Huangchao’s flesh was rapidly strengthening, with chaos holy power continuously reinforcing it.

“Rivaling a complete nine-body? Though powerful, I am the Reincarnation Body!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light. Black demon qi surged, and the Dao power spread around his body, making his flesh stronger.

“Luo Tian’s kid has some thoughts. He used Dao power to strengthen his flesh!” Several domain lords’ eyes showed surprise, admiration for Luo Tian’s young age and his understanding of Dao power.

As people marveled, Luo Tian and Zhu Ge Huangchao rose again, rushing toward each other. One black fist met one gray fist.

“Buddha Heaven Attack!” Luo Tian’s low roar, Buddha Heaven Attack technique unleashed. The Dao封魔拳 swung toward Zhu Ge Huangchao.

This punch was Luo Tian’s full strength. A sage in the late stage would be shattered by this punch.

“Chaos Infinity!” Facing Luo Tian’s full strength punch, Zhu Ge Huangchao trembled. At this moment, he finally understood how powerful Luo Tian was and unleashed a punch with all his strength.

“Boom…” In an instant, their fists collided. The arena reinforced by three peak sage elders emitted lightning waves under their feet, piercing through space and floating around them.

Next moment, Zhu Ge Huangchao’s body suddenly moved. His figure flew like a kite with broken strings backward, colliding with the black barrier.

“Zhu Ge Huangchao lost!” People gasped, their eyes filled with awe. They hadn’t expected the powerful Zhu Ge Huangchao to show weakness so quickly.

“This kid, if not suppressed by Heaven, will surely reach great glory. The era master of the past was no different!” Six domain lords all felt their hearts tremble, changing their gaze toward Luo Tian. However, they soon calmed down, for now, no matter how strong he was, it represented the present. Suppressed by Heaven, his future path would make him a stepping stone for others.

Zhu Ge Huangchao slowly fell from the barrier, his face filled with disbelief. Blood flowed continuously from his lips.

“Very powerful! You weren’t shattered by my punch, so you are the first!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed admiration as he gazed at Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Again!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s eyes showed resentment, rushing toward Luo Tian again. His aura did not decrease but increased as he punched.

“Useless! Make you submit!” Luo Tian moved, the Dao power again roaring out and colliding with Zhu Ge Huangchao.

Though Zhu Ge Huangchao was strong, the next moment he was again knocked back by Luo Tian’s punch.

“Again!” Zhu Ge Huangchao, like an indestructible superman, rose quickly after being knocked back and rushed toward Luo Tian. His tenacity was极致.

Luo Tian did not hold back either. Zhu Ge Huangchao had previously insulted him and even boasted to make Long Jie his servant, touching Luo Tian’s底线. Thus, Luo Tian’s subordinates showed no mercy.

“One punch… ten punches…” Under people’s shock, they clashed over a hundred times. Zhu Ge Huangchao finally was knocked to the ground by Luo Tian’s punch, his body covered in cracks. Dao power continuously flowed through the cracks.

“Zhu Ge Huangchao lost! He never managed to suppress Luo Tian!” People’s faces showed amazement, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Being born in the same era as Luo Tian is a tragedy. Even Zhu Ge Huangchao lost. Who else can be Luo Tian’s opponent without the nine bodies? Even if the nine bodies appear, who can match the Reincarnation Body? No wonder Heaven suppresses him!” People discussed as they gazed at Zhu Ge Huangchao lying on the ground.

“I am invincible. No one of my peers can defeat me, except for my brother!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s low roar echoed. Under people’s awe, he slowly rose, his eyes turning gray.

“Invincibility is a state. When you said no one could defeat you except your brother, your invincible heart was already affected! In a narrow encounter, the brave win. Your quick defeat also relates to your belief!” Luo Tian stood there, looking down at Zhu Ge Huangchao as he had when Zhu Ge Huangchao looked down on everyone.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhu Ge Huangchao trembled. Then his face showed madness, his mouth continuously growling: “I still have one more move. No one in the same level can withstand it!”

Zhu Ge Huangchao seemed to have fallen into a mad state. His hands, though still cracking, moved continuously in front of him. Gray mist flowed out from his hands, eventually filling the entire barrier. Luo Tian stood there, allowing Zhu Ge Huangchao to perform.

“Chaos Nurtures Green Thunder!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s low cry, his hands pressed into the void.

“Hum…” As Zhu Ge Huangchao pressed down, the chaos holy power filling the barrier surged. Green lightning gradually rose within the chaos holy power.

“Divine Might!” Luo Tian stood in the chaos holy power, allowing it to strike his body. He watched the green lightning moving within the chaos and wore a serious expression.

Suppressed by Heaven, Luo Tian could feel the green lightning contained divine might. It was terrifying; if he wasn’t careful, he would be severely injured or even die. He knew the divine might’s danger.

“Divine Might? Luo Tian’s kid was previously suppressed by Heaven. If it were a normal divine might like ordinary thunderstorms, it wouldn’t affect him much, right?” People discussed as the green lightning gradually filled with chaos holy power.

“Hum…” The chaos holy power slowly disappeared, eventually merging completely into the green lightning under people’s amazement.

With the chaos holy power gone, nine thick green lightning bolts appeared in front of people. They hung above Zhu Ge Huangchao’s head.

“Go!” Zhu Ge Huangchao, as if drained of all strength, pointed at Luo Tian.

As if obeying Zhu Ge Huangchao’s command, the nine green lightning bolts moved instantly. In an instant, they appeared above Luo Tian’s head.

“I’ll see if the lightning nurtured by chaos holy power is stronger than true divine thunder!” Luo Tian spoke loudly, his eyes filled with seriousness. The Dao power spread again, golden seals falling from the sky toward the green lightning.

“Crack!” However, the next moment, Luo Tian’s Kai Tian Seal was directly shattered by the green lightning and vanished from people’s sight.

“Good enough. It’s still within my tolerance,” Luo Tian looked at the shattered Kai Tian Seal, his expression showing no surprise. After all, this seal was meant to test the green lightning’s power.

Thinking of that, Luo Tian flew up and used the Buddha Heaven Attack technique with his Dao封魔拳 toward the nine lightning bolts.

“Die! I’ve never seen anyone dare to use their body to withstand my chaos-nurtured green thunder!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face was filled with mockery, as if he had already seen Luo Tian being shattered into pieces.

Then Zhu Ge Huangchao’s already pale face became even paler, his eyes filled with intense shock. The entire demon mountain’s people watching Luo Tian and Zhu Ge Huangchao’s battle also inhaled sharply.

In their view, Luo Tian’s figure was like a black eagle. He collided with the green lightning. One bolt was directly shattered by Luo Tian’s punch, while two others struck his body.

“Boom…” White smoke rose from Luo Tian’s body. Cracks appeared at the location of the two green lightning strikes.

“Powerful! Being struck by two divine thunder-like green lightning bolts, his body only cracked slightly!” People’s faces showed amazement as Luo Tian continued toward the remaining six lightning bolts.

“Damn it, you still can’t beat me!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face was completely grim. His eyes showed intense resentment. He bit his teeth and spat out a stream of blood, which turned into a red arrow and flew toward the six lightning bolts.

“Crack!” The six green lightning bolts, before Luo Tian reached them, suddenly surged and emitted a blinding light, illuminating the entire barrier.

Luo Tian stopped. After being enhanced by Zhu Ge Huangchao’s blood, he could clearly feel that he couldn’t withstand all six lightning bolts with their immense power.
