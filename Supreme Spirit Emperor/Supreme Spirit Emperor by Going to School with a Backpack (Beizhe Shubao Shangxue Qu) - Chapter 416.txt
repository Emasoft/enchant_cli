Luo Tian gazed at the radiant light in Yao Chen's eyes, his heart filled with sorrow for the people of Tianyuan Continent. This was Yao Chen's first visit to Tianyuan, and given her nature, it would be uncharacteristic for her not to seek a sparring match. With her current strength, what she called "sparring" was nothing more than a ruthless beating. Even if she had self-imposed restrictions on her cultivation, no one could match her.

Night...

Luo Tian stood outside his courtyard, a look of embarrassment on his face, unsure what awaited him inside.

"Alas..." Luo Tian let out a long sigh. No matter what, he would have to face it eventually.

Luo Tian wore a bitter smile as he stepped into a side room of the courtyard. From his mother Zhang Qiyue, he learned where Fu Xingxuan resided.

"Knock knock knock..." Luo Tian knocked on the door, then spoke softly: "Xingxuan, I'm coming in!"

Luo Tian pushed open the door, a faint smile on his face. He saw Fu Xingxuan seated there, her eyes slightly vacant.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian asked with confusion, his gaze meeting Fu Xingxuan's. Her eyes were purple and gazed at him with a distant look.

"You left me there this afternoon!" Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, her voice laced with disappointment. She said nothing more.

"Ah..." Cold sweat immediately rolled down Luo Tian's forehead as he recalled Fu Xingxuan's difficulties. At the time, he had been so terrified by Jiang Sxi and her companions' stares that he had only fled, forgetting about Fu Xingxuan. Compared to himself, Fu Xingxuan had been far more embarrassed.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian slapped his head in frustration, feeling like a despicable person. His eyes filled with regret as he sat before Fu Xingxuan.

"I shouldn't have left you alone!" Luo Tian spoke with regret, his hand grasping Fu Xingxuan's.

At this point in their relationship, anyone could see it. Luo Tian had no need to feel embarrassed.

Fu Xingxuan's hand was warm, slightly damp from the intimacy with Luo Tian. Yet, his large hand provided a comforting warmth that she was reluctant to let go of.

"What's next?" Fu Xingxuan asked Luo Tian, her face slightly flushed. The sight of it made Luo Tian's heart flutter.

Fu Xingxuan was breathtakingly beautiful. When Luo Tian had first met her, he had been stunned by her beauty. Now, with a faint blush on her pale face, Luo Tian was certain that no man could resist. He felt a rush of blood to his head as if it might burst forth at any moment.

"I'll handle it," Luo Tian said softly. "I'll talk to Qiu Chan and the others. If I behave properly, they will accept you."

"I believe in you," Fu Xingxuan said. As soon as she heard Luo Tian's words, she leaned against his shoulder. She trusted that he would handle their relationship well because he had never let her down before.

Luo Tian embraced Fu Xingxuan, his heart groaning in defeat. He then leaned down and kissed her cheek.

"Don't..." Before Luo Tian's lips could reach their goal, Fu Xingxuan quickly broke free from his grasp and shook her head fiercely.

"We're not married yet. We can't..." Fu Xingxuan's face was flushed, fearing Luo Tian would take advantage and lose control. That would be a disaster.

"Uh..." Luo Tian's face was awkward, but he respected Fu Xingxuan. He nodded gently.

"Rest well. I'll check on the three of them and discuss our situation," Luo Tian said, lightly tapping Fu Xingxuan's forehead before leaving her room.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed again, gazing at the three women's rooms with a bitter smile.

"Who should I approach first? Mengru might be manageable. Maybe start with Qiu Chan, but Sxi is temperamental. I'll go for the softest first," he thought before heading toward Qiu Chan's room.

"Qiu Chan, I'm coming in!" Luo Tian called out before entering her room.

"Hmm?" Upon entering the room, he felt a chill run down his spine.

Moments later, Luo Tian saw three women seated there, their eyes filled with disdain as they gazed at him standing at the door.

"Ah..." Luo Tian's expression froze, sweat immediately forming on his forehead. He silently cursed; these three girls must have anticipated he would come to Qiu Chan first.

"Dead..." Luo Tian mentally sighed, his face displaying a fawning smile. Under the authority of these three women, he dared not be bold.

"Everyone's here..." Luo Tian looked at the three women who said nothing, merely staring at him. He quickly spoke up; if he didn't say something now, it would be tantamount to seeking death.

"Tell me, what's going on? How did you bring one back!" Jiang Sxi asked with a serious face, her gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

"Did Mengru tell you two already?" Luo Tian chuckled nervously, his eyes carefully watching the three.

"You have to explain it yourself. I can't," Sun Mengru crossed her arms, clearly indifferent.

"Did you hear that you obtained some White Bone Spirit Bamboo in the Bone Forest?" Before Luo Tian could speak further, Jiang Sxi smiled, her expression one of charm.

Jiang Sxi's smile was breathtakingly beautiful. Yet to Luo Tian, it was terrifying.

"Yes... yes..." But Luo Tian dared not say a word. His face wore a fawning smile as he waved his hand, producing several White Bone Spirit Bamboo. He hurriedly approached Jiang Sxi.

"Stand there!" Before Luo Tian could take two steps, a cold voice echoed in his mind: "Cold Qiu Chan."

"Okay!" Luo Tian quickly stopped, feeling like a servant before them.

"Place the White Bone Spirit Bamboo on the ground and kneel there to speak!" Jiang Sxi ordered.

"This..." Luo Tian's face was hesitant. The White Bone Spirit Bamboo was a spiritual item, but it had spines like bones on its surface. It was extremely hard. Although Luo Tian's body was strong, Jiang Sxi had not spoken, but he knew that if he used his cultivation and physical strength, it would only make things worse.

"What?" Seeing Luo Tian's hesitation, the three women's gazes darkened immediately.

Luo Tian had no choice but to grit his teeth and slowly placed the White Bone Spirit Bamboo on the ground. However, as he bowed, a memory of Xu Liyi's previous advice to subdue Luo Qingqing flashed through his mind. His eyes gleamed with determination.

"Hmph..." Thinking of Xu Liyi's words, Luo Tian's expression turned cold. The three women were taken aback.

"A true man should not be intimidated! You make me kneel. Isn't that too much?" Luo Tian spoke with anger, his eyes filled with disappointment.

"Crack..." Seeing the three women's expressions shift under his sudden change in demeanor, Luo Tian felt a surge of joy. He then tossed the White Bone Spirit Bamboo onto the ground.

The fragile White Bone Spirit Bamboo could not withstand Luo Tian's toss. It shattered into pieces on the ground.

"Truly subdued!" Luo Tian watched the three women in a daze, his joy deepening. His eyes burned with more anger.

"Fu Xingxuan risked everything to save me. I owe her my life. Her heart is visible to heaven. I am not a man who betrays others. If I were, would you three be here now?" Luo Tian sighed softly, his tone suddenly shifting. He gazed at the three women with deep emotion.

Chapter 1635: The Little Mystic

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the three women's expressions changed. Compared to Gu Qianxue, they were indeed newcomers. Especially Cold Qiu Chan, recalling her own experiences with Luo Tian, she felt a strong similarity to Fu Xingxuan.

"You think I should betray Xingxuan?" Luo Tian looked at the three women, who had fallen silent. He decided to seize the moment and fully win them over before going to sleep, as he hadn't been intimate with his wives in a long time. He had already built up a fire from Fu Xingxuan.

"Should..." Jiang Sxi, Sun Mengru, and Cold Qiu Chan were about to nod in agreement with Luo Tian's words. But their expressions changed slightly.

"Good..." Jiang Sxi saw the confidence in Luo Tian's eyes and immediately understood. Her expression darkened further.

"Then, if someone sacrifices for you, will you take them in? I don't think it's that you don't want to betray them, but rather you've already had this in mind!" Jiang Sxi spoke seriously.

"Hmph..." Sun Mengru and Cold Qiu Chan also quickly regained their senses, their faces filled with frost.

"Still trying to intimidate us?" Sun Mengru's face had a hint of laughter before, but now it was icy.

"Damn..." Luo Tian felt the air in the room grow colder. He mentally cursed, feeling things were getting worse. He cursed Xu Liyi for being a fool who boasted about his skills, this trick was no good at all.

"Ah-choo..." At that moment, Xu Liyi, who was hot and bothered, suddenly sneezed. This made Luo Qingqing look surprised.

"Who the hell is cursing me!" Xu Liyi cursed loudly.

"Don't just stare, keep going!" Before Xu Liyi could speak again, Luo Qingqing ordered.

"Okay, okay!" Xu Liyi quickly switched to a smile and continued.

"Get out of here..." Unlike Xu Liyi's situation, Luo Tian now felt a steel knife at his neck. His three wives were even more terrifying than before.

"Crack..." Thinking of this, Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He immediately knelt on the ground without using his cultivation or physical strength.

"Ah..." The next moment, Luo Tian regretted it. He had knelt quickly but forgot that the ground still had the shattered White Bone Spirit Bamboo. The pain shot through his knees immediately.

"Jiang Sxi, Mengru, Qiu Chan. I know I was wrong! I'll never do it again!" But Luo Tian only suffered for a moment before his face turned pitiful, gazing at the three women.

"Hmph... Stay there and lift your knees. If we find a piece of the White Bone Spirit Bamboo tomorrow morning, you'll never see us again!" Jiang Sxi spoke coldly before yawning.

"Qiu Chan, you sleep with me tonight. We haven't slept together in a long time, little girl. Leave him to us!" Jiang Sxi ordered Cold Qiu Chan before stepping out of the door.

"Okay." Cold Qiu Chan nodded, following Jiang Sxi and Sun Mengru out of the door.

"I'm going too!" Sun Mengru quickly spoke, the three women laughing as they walked out of the door.

"I really know I was wrong! Take me too!" Luo Tian watched the three women leave. Thinking of their image together, he felt his whole body uncomfortable. He grabbed Jiang Sxi's leg and begged her to let him in. He had realized that if he could win over Jiang Sxi, it would be much easier to handle Sun Mengru and Cold Qiu Chan.

"Don't move. I was going to forgive you for kneeling all night today, but now that you moved, we'll have you kneel another night!" Jiang Sxi sneered and pried Luo Tian's hand off, walking out of the door.

"I..." Luo Tian watched the three figures leave. He dared not move; if he had to kneel another night, he would be ruined by his three wives.

"Damn it, Xu Liyi. Don't let me see you again!" Luo Tian grew more angry, blaming Xu Liyi for his predicament. If it weren't for Xu Liyi's boasting earlier, he wouldn't have ended up in this situation.

"How am I going to survive this night..." Luo Tian sighed, cursing Xu Liyi repeatedly in his heart.

"Ah-choo... Ah-choo..." Xu Liyi, who was excited, sneezed again. This time it was even more violent, splattering Luo Qingqing's face with snot.

"Didn't you do it heartlessly? Get out of here, old woman!" Luo Qingqing was furious and kicked Xu Liyi off the bed.

"Qingqing..." Xu Liyi cursed in his heart but was kicked out of the room again by Luo Qingqing, looking pitiful.

"Why did I sneeze like that?" Xu Liyi wanted to cry but couldn't figure out why he had suddenly sneezed.

One night passed silently. This night was the most painful for Luo Tian, feeling his entire lower body numb.

"Finally, it's morning!" Luo Tian watched the sunlight enter Cold Qiu Chan's room and sighed deeply. He leaned on the table to stand up, trembling as he walked to Cold Qiu Chan's bed. His eyes were bloodshot and he immediately lay down on the bed.

"This trick really worked, didn't it!" As soon as Luo Tian lay down on Cold Qiu Chan's bed, Jiang Sxi and the others smiled and entered the room. They saw Luo Tian lying there like a dead dog, their eyes briefly showing concern.

"You're here!" Luo Tian felt the three women's arrival and immediately sat up, his face displaying a fawning smile.

"Get out! Come back tonight to continue kneeling!" Jiang Sxi kicked Luo Tian out and closed the door.

"My ancestor!" Luo Tian mentally shouted. He felt like he had lost half his life last night. If he had to do another night, he would be ruined.

However, shortly after, Luo Tian suddenly stood up. His eyes carried a hint of authority as he walked out of Cold Qiu Chan's room.

"Dad?" A clear voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears, making him slowly turn around. He looked at the figure approaching.

"Li'er, why are you dressed like this?" Luo Tian turned around and saw the figure he had seen in his spiritual sense. He asked.

"It's for cultivation, Master once told us to cultivate more by entering the world!" The person was none other than Luo Tian's beloved son, Luo Li.

But Luo Li's attire made Luo Tian's mouth twitch. At this moment, Luo Li wore a rough silk robe. Though it looked clean enough, it was old and worn. His shoulder carried a broken sail, making him look like the second version of Ji Jiuyou's appearance.

"You..." Luo Tian looked at Luo Li's attire, feeling regretful for letting Luo Li be taught by Ji Jiuyou.

"Father, what's wrong? Why are there bloodstains on your knees?" While Luo Tian was observing Luo Li, he also noticed the trembling legs and bloodstains on Luo Tian's knees.

"Nothing. I just experienced a big battle, didn't have time to change clothes!" Luo Tian's face slightly changed.

"You're going to do what for this world cultivation? Don't you want to predict the future for others?" Luo Tian tried to shift the topic.

"No, father. You weren't like this yesterday!" Luo Li knew well what his father had worn the day before.

"I did predict for others. Everyone in Tianyuan Continent knows my name, Luo the Mystic!" But Luo Li still answered Luo Tian's question with a proud expression.

"Little bastard, don't ask what you shouldn't. Also, are you predicting for others? What kind of world did you predict? Let me see if I can predict it!" Luo Tian, who was watching Luo Li's knees, became angry and tried to shift the topic again.

"Okay!" Luo Tian's words were successful. Obviously, Luo Li was more interested in predicting for his father. After saying this, Luo Li extended his hand.

"What are you doing? Do you want to read my palm?" Luo Tian handed his hand over to Luo Li, but it was snatched away immediately.

"Father, you need to pay first. Otherwise, I won't read it!" Luo Li told Luo Tian, making his face more angry.

"Stupid son! Are you asking your father for money?" Luo Tian was not happy and slapped Luo Li's head.

"Father, it's a rule. Rules can't be broken. Just give me something as a token!" Luo Li said seriously, yelling at Luo Tian.

"Damn..." Luo Tian handed Luo Li a few pieces of Qi stones and showed impatience.

"Come on, read it!" After handing over the Qi stones, Luo Tian also placed his hand, palm up, in front of Luo Li.

"Hmm..." Luo Li nodded slightly and then carefully examined the lines on Luo Tian's hand. His fingers moved continuously, sending waves of energy from his changing fingers, making Luo Tian look surprised.

"This kid... could he really predict?" Luo Tian looked at Luo Li with suspicion, feeling that this kid was more like a fraud who tricked people into giving him food and money.

"Father, you'll have an incident in the next few days. It's a romantic disaster!" Luo Li then told Luo Tian, making his eyes change.

"Can it really predict?" Luo Tian was shocked. Luo Li had truly predicted that he would have a romantic disaster. He had suffered last night, and he would suffer again tonight.

"Is there any way to break it?" Luo Tian's face showed interest as he looked at Luo Li. If this issue could be resolved, it would be the best.

"Breaking it is possible, but..." Luo Li spoke softly and then moved his fingers again. This time, however, no waves were emitted.

Chapter 1636: The Father's Trap

"Damn..." Luo Tian looked at Luo Li moving his fingers and his face turned grim. He had stayed in the mundane world before, so he knew what this gesture meant.

"Are you asking your father for money?" Luo Tian slapped Luo Li's head and shouted.

"It's a rule, Father. The more serious the incident, the more expensive it is!" Luo Li looked at Luo Tian with a pained expression.

"Go on, you little bastard. What do you want?" Luo Tian looked at Luo Li's serious eyes and his heart slightly steadied. Ji Jiuyou's divination skills were something Luo Tian respected. He believed that his son, as a direct disciple of Ji Jiuyou, would not be much worse.

"This depends on how heavy the incident is in your heart. The heavier it is, the more expensive it is!" Luo Li's eyes shone with light as he looked at Luo Tian.

"This..." Hearing Luo Li's words, Luo Tian hesitated. This romantic disaster was a big issue for him. If he paid a certain price, he would be willing to pay everything he had. After all, treasures could be found again, but wives were hard to find.

"Here..." Then Luo Tian bit his teeth and waved his hand, presenting the arm bone he had obtained from the Supreme Master to Luo Li's eyes.

"Son, this is a bone of an epoch master. It's precious!" Luo Tian told Luo Li and then handed him many things, almost giving away the Thunder Sword of Heaven. He had already believed in Luo Li.

"Okay, Father..." Luo Li looked at the treasures being handed to him by his father without hesitation and took them.

"Done!" Luo Tian felt it was enough, then said to Luo Li with an expectant look.

"Okay, Father. To break this incident, you need to go east!" Luo Li shook his head and then acted like a sage. He pinched his fingers again, speaking to Luo Tian.

After saying this, Luo Li shouldered the broken sail and walked away with a mysterious smile that looked profound to Luo Tian.

"Is it done? I gave you so much, and you just said that!" Luo Tian watched Luo Li walking away. His whole body was confused, and he moved instantly to block Luo Li's path.

"Father? What's wrong?" Seeing Luo Tian blocking him, Luo Li's face slightly changed.

"You just told me to go east. Where should I go east?" Luo Tian was not happy.

"Ah... The mysteries of heaven cannot be revealed, Father. If I say too much, it will bring a curse. Especially for someone as powerful as you, the mysteries are very strange. I can't say too much. I can only tell you to go east, and within three days, this incident will be over!" Luo Li's eyes were confident.

"Three days. That's okay!" Luo Tian thought of Ji Jiuyou's previous prediction for the entire Tianyuan Continent, which cost him a hundred years of life. He didn't want Luo Li to say too much.

"Okay, I believe you this time! Of course, if it's not accurate, you should know the consequences!" Luo Tian smiled and patted Luo Li's shoulder.

"Rest assured, Father. My name as the Little Mystic isn't a lie!" Luo Li smiled confidently and patted his chest.

"Okay, I believe you once. You can't trick your father!" Luo Tian sighed long after hearing Luo Li's confident words.

"I'll go first, Father!" After saying this, Luo Li walked away with a mysterious demeanor toward the Five Elements Mountain. As soon as he stepped down from the Five Elements Mountain, his face glowed with a sly light and disappeared from the spot.

"Go east!" Luo Tian kept thinking about what Luo Li had said. Although he believed it, his eyes still showed doubt. He walked eastward from the Five Elements Gate.

However, this time, Luo Tian changed into a new set of clothes. After all, the bloodstains on his knees were hard to explain.

As Luo Tian walked, a storm swept across the entire Tianyuan Continent. Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi began to clean up the Tianyuan Continent, causing it to tremble. People knew that this was likely Luo Tian's return and his intention to clean up the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Still, some people were afraid. After all, those being cleansed were people with status on the Tianyuan Continent. These people had connections, and people feared that if they weren't cleansed thoroughly, they would become even more oppressive.

When Xu Liyi used a ruthless and decisive method to kill one of the Five Elements' elders and their entire clan, people finally believed it was truly a large-scale cleansing.

This action immediately made those who had suffered unfair treatment across the Tianyuan Continent cheer. It was a good thing for them.

Luo Tian, however, paid no attention to these matters. He believed that with the methods of everyone else, this kind of task would be no problem.

Luo Tian followed Luo Li's guidance and walked eastward from the Five Elements Mountain. He moved slowly, as Jiang Sxi had said he would have to kneel again that night.

"Is it accurate or not?" Luo Tian kept muttering to himself as he walked. After a day, the sky was gradually darkening. Luo Tian knew it was time to return. If he returned late, his three wives might come up with other ways to punish him. Then he would have no place to cry.

"Ah?" But just as Luo Tian was about to leave, he saw a courtyard. His eyes brightened slightly.

This courtyard was none other than his father Luo Nantian and mother Zhang Qiu Yue's residence. Seeing their home, Luo Tian couldn't help but slap his thigh.

"Yes!" After saying this, he put on the same clothes he had worn when kneeling before the White Bone Spirit Bamboo. The bloodstains on his knees were already dry.

After putting it on, Luo Tian's face showed a sorrowful expression. He didn't need to act; his previous appearance was already unfortunate enough. This acting made him feel like he had stepped in dog feces.

"Dad, Mom!" Luo Tian pushed open the courtyard door. Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue were sitting at a stone table, chatting happily.

As their generation grew up, the older generation of strong warriors like Luo Nantian and Luo Xiong retreated to the background, enjoying a peaceful life.

"Tiān'er?" Seeing Luo Tian walking in, they were surprised. However, after seeing the sorrow on his face and his somewhat ragged clothes, their faces showed confusion.

"Why aren't you staying with your wife? Why are you coming here?" Zhang Qiu Yue smiled and asked Luo Tian.

"Alas..." Hearing Zhang Qiu Yue's words, Luo Tian sighed deeply. "Mom, I'm so unlucky!"

After saying this, he recounted his experiences to Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue with a pitiful expression.

However, after hearing Luo Tian's words, the faces of Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue darkened. This made Luo Tian happy.

"It worked! As long as my father and mother are here, those three girls won't dare to resist!" Luo Tian felt proud. He also marveled at how accurate Luo Li's prediction was. If he hadn't gone east, he wouldn't have thought of coming to his parents to intimidate those three wives.

Seeing the depth in Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue's eyes, Luo Tian knew that his parents were angry at the three wives.

"Dad and Mom, I know I was wrong. They are upset because of me, so they punished me by making me kneel!" Luo Tian carefully watched them, fearing that if they got angry, they would go to the three wives and his mistake would be great. He wasn't here to stir up trouble but to ask them to solve the problem.

"Smack..." But before Luo Tian could continue, Luo Nantian slapped him across the face.

"Rebellious son!" Luo Nantian's face turned red. He panted heavily, pointing at Luo Tian and then kicked him again.

"Don't call me dad. I'm not your dad. You are my dad!"

"Jiang Sxi, Qiu Chan, and Mengru—each of them is a peerless beauty. You married four already? How much hardship have they endured for you these years? You weren't even there when your child was born. Now you've brought another one back. Who do you think you're betraying!" Luo Nantian shouted, his eyes filled with anger as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Blah!" Luo Tian's mind was flooded with only this word. He had been completely stunned by Luo Nantian's slap and kick.

"The script wasn't supposed to be like this!" Luo Tian mentally shouted. But it was his father, and he couldn't resist. He had to endure it, fearing that Luo Nantian might be injured.

"You let me kneel. That's a mercy. I, Luo Nantian, how could I have such a son? Our family started with my great-grandfather. Men had only one wife. You have four and still aren't satisfied!" Luo Nantian didn't let Luo Tian speak again, continuing to scold him.

"Tiān'er, you really went too far this time. I firmly stand on Jiang Sxi's side..." Zhang Qiu Yue also scolded him, but she didn't hit him.

"I..." Luo Tian didn't know how to speak. He mentally cursed: "Luo Li, you little bastard! I'll deal with you after this is over!"

Luo Tian felt these two days were the worst of his life. He had knelt for a night, then was tricked by his son, and finally beaten by his father.

"Can't I live anymore! Can you make me even luckier!" Luo Tian mentally shouted.

"A little bastard, come here!" But as soon as Luo Tian finished his mental shout, a voice echoed from outside the courtyard. Luoxiong stormed in with anger and kicked open the door, walking toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 1637: Arrangement

"Grandpa..." Seeing Luoxiong storming in, Luo Tian's face fell. He thought this hot-tempered old man would also come to beat him.

"Kneel down!" Luoxiong coldly sneered and looked at Luo Tian, speaking coldly.

"Grandpa, I know I was wrong!" Luo Tian dared not refuse and immediately knelt before the three of them.

"Little bastard, are you going to bring in more? Then we'll have to clean up after you!" Luoxiong scolded Luo Tian, his voice filled with anger.

"I promise it's the last one!" Luo Tian quickly spoke, making a promise. His eyes looked pitifully at them.

"Smack..." As soon as Luo Tian's words fell, Luoxiong slapped Luo Nantian: "How could you educate your son like this!"

"Dad..." Luo Nantian was also stunned by his father's slap, not knowing why Luoxiong had hit him.

"What kind of way is this to beat people? If you know you're wrong, just fix it. What's with the beating and scolding?" Luoxiong spoke coldly.

"Cough cough..." Luo Tian watched Luo Nantian and sighed inwardly. It seemed his last hope was his grandfather.

"You also beat me like this, right?" Luo Nantian felt like crying. He remembered how often he had been beaten by Luoxiong since childhood. Now, beating his son and grandson was not allowed.

"Alright, now that there's a problem, let's solve it!" Luoxiong said and sat down. He looked at Luo Tian again.

"Tell me, how did you meet that girl from the Starlight Clan?" Luoxiong asked Luo Tian.

Luo Tian naturally dared not be careless with his domineering grandfather. He was the last hope now, so he truthfully told them about Fu Xingxuan.

"Hmm. She's worth it," Luoxiong nodded. Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue said nothing.

"However, those three girls are not easy to deal with. The rest is up to the two of you. And you, little bastard, married so many wives and only had two children! That's not enough. I regretted it when I only had this one!" Luoxiong then spoke loudly, his back straight as he walked out.

"..."

Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue looked at Luoxiong walking away in silence. Even Luo Tian's mouth twitched as he watched his grandfather, but he was secretly happy. He sighed that perhaps the one who truly cared for him in the entire Tianyuan Continent was this grandfather.

"You go there!" Luo Nantian's face showed anger. He waved his sleeve and walked into the room.

The courtyard was now only left with Luo Tian and Zhang Qiu Yue. Luo Tian's gaze fell on Zhang Qiu Yue, his eyes pitifully looking at her.

Zhang Qiu Yue looked at Luo Nantian's angry departure and then at the pitifully kneeling Luo Tian. Her face showed helplessness.

"Go!" Zhang Qiu Yue finally felt pity for her son and, since Fu Xingxuan's beauty and character also pleased her, she let him go.

Mother and son walked toward Luo Tian's residence. Their pace was much faster than when Luo Tian had come. They soon arrived at Luo Tian's residence, and the sky was completely dark.

"Mom, it's all up to you!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly. If Zhang Qiu Yue couldn't handle it, he really had no idea what to do.

"Stupid son. You don't know what those three wives are like?" Zhang Qiu Yue was also quite troubled, then led Luo Tian into the courtyard.

They entered the courtyard and stood outside Cold Qiu Chan's door. Zhang Qiu Yue gently knocked on it.

"Mom?" The door opened, and Jiang Sxi appeared. Seeing Zhang Qiu Yue, their faces slightly changed. Then they saw the pitifully kneeling Luo Tian behind her.

"Mom, why are you here?" The three of them were smart enough to understand Zhang Qiu Yue's intention. They glared at Luo Tian and then smiled, pulling Zhang Qiu Yue into the room. As for Luo Tian, they didn't care.

"Kneel!" Zhang Qiu Yue looked at the White Bone Spirit Bamboo still on the ground and scolded Luo Tian.

"Yes..." Luo Tian dared not delay. He knelt on the White Bone Spirit Bamboo, his legs trembling again.

"Deserve it, stupid son. Going out and flirting!" Zhang Qiu Yue scolded Luo Tian harshly, then smiled at Jiang Sxi and the others.

"Come on. Let this son stay here kneeling. You two come with me to talk!" Zhang Qiu Yue turned around, looking like a different person. She spoke to Jiang Sxi and the others.

The three of them naturally dared not disobey Zhang Qiu Yue. They surrounded her and walked out of the room, leaving Luo Tian alone.

"Mom, I'm counting on you!" Luo Tian mentally hoped as he watched Zhang Qiu Yue and the others leave. He knelt again, pitifully.

One night passed silently. The next morning's sunlight entered the room again. Luo Tian, like before, struggled to stand up and lay on Sun Mengru's bed.
