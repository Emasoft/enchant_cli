“Try to help as much as you can. If not, then flee!” Luo Tian thought to himself. This battle hinged on the Immortal King, but the merfolk side had only one early-stage Immortal King, while the Shark Clan possessed two.

“Think you can eat me?” Luo Tian sneered, his Longyuan sword erupting in a burst of power as he slashed at the Shark Clan’s early-stage Immortal King. The Shark Clan’s half-step Immortal King raised a bone sword to meet the strike. A thunderous collision echoed, and both warriors staggered back. Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with disappointment.

“Still not fully recovered, and this underwater realm suppresses me,” Luo Tian muttered. His gaze fell on the merfolk warrior who had been thrown into a coughing fit.

Luo Tian took another step forward, his body sheathed in a layer of black demonic armor—Mingmo Armor. After all, Luo Tian was no longer the same as before.

“Fearsome!” The Shark Clan’s half-step Immortal King grimaced but charged forward without hesitation.

The two clashed repeatedly, their blows shaking the battlefield. Though Luo Tian was not at his peak, he held the half-step Immortal King in check. Within moments, the Shark Clan warrior bore grievous wounds.

Meanwhile, Fuxingyue’s fight was far easier. No half-step Immortal King had targeted him; instead, he protected Shui Yunqian amidst the chaos, each strike of his Star Moon Divine Spear felling two or three Shark Clan warriors.

But the merfolk suffered greatly. Blood stained the surrounding waters as more of their kin fell.

“Damn it…” Shui Li’s face was pale, surrounded by two early-stage Immortal Kings. Each clash was perilous, and defeat was merely a matter of time.

The onlookers—those who had come to celebrate Shui Changkong’s birthday—watched with sorrow. Who could have foreseen that a joyous occasion would turn into tragedy? If things worsened, the merfolk might be annihilated or enslaved by the Shark Clan.

Chapter 2346: Reengaging the Immortal King

In the Xuantian Sea, such brutality was commonplace. Clans clashed daily, and some were eradicated without mercy.

At this moment, the merfolk’s territory was a battlefield between two clans. The merfolk and Shark Clan were both major forces; without extraordinary reasons, they would not risk annihilation. Both sides were too powerful—mutual destruction was inevitable.

“Boom!” Luo Tian severed the Shark Clan’s half-step Immortal King with a single strike, panting as he surveyed the battlefield. His gaze shifted to where Bai Sha and Shui Changkong clashed, their blows shaking the heavens. Any true immortal caught in the waves would be shattered.

Shui Li’s situation was dire, barely holding on as two early-stage Immortal Kings closed in.

“Terrifying. Even more so than an early-stage Immortal King!” Luo Tian mused, his Longyuan sword slicing through the Shark Clan’s encirclement to reach Fuxingyue.

“Stay close!” Luo Tian ordered Fuxingyue, realizing the merfolk’s desperation and preparing to flee.

“You first ensure Xiaqian’s safety!” Fuxingyue countered, smashing a Shark Clan warrior with his spear. Shui Yunqian was merely an advanced true immortal, formidable among the clans but helpless in this battlefield without an Immortal King’s protection.

Luo Tian hesitated not a moment. Though Fuxingyue was flirtatious, he cared deeply for his wife. Luo Tian extended a hand, summoning Shui Yunqian before joining Fuxingyue in relentless combat. Yet the Shark Clan’s numbers were overwhelming, and even they dared not press too deep.

“Can’t take much more. My future father-in-law won’t last!” Fuxingyue observed Shui Li’s struggle, his expression grim. He leapt into the air, charging toward another early-stage Immortal King.

“Damn it! You dare touch my future father-in-law? I’ll show you!” Fuxingyue roared, his Star Moon Divine Spear radiating overwhelming power as it descended upon the early-stage Immortal King.

Fuxingyue’s outburst startled Shui Li, who momentarily thought reinforcements had arrived. Upon recognizing Fuxingyue, however, Shui Li’s eyes widened with gratitude but also resignation.

“Foolish half-step Immortal King dares challenge an Immortal King’s authority? A human, truly desperate!” The Shark Clan warrior sneered, dismissing Fuxingyue as a fool. He extended a blue hand, slamming it down upon Fuxingyue.

“Boom!” Fuxingyue was crushed under the hand, his body and spear crashing to the ground.

“Cough… cough…” Fuxingyue spat blood, finally understanding the Immortal King’s might. Though a prodigy, he had believed he could hold off an early-stage Immortal King long enough for Shui Li to recover. Now, he realized his mistake.

“Unbelievable! How did Luo Tian manage this?” Fuxingyue sighed, watching Luo Tian vanish. He gritted his teeth and charged the early-stage Immortal King again.

“Self-destructive!” The Shark Clan warrior sneered, striking again. This time, Fuxingyue was crushed even harder, collapsing like a pile of mud.

“Kid, you’ve done enough. If you can get Yunqian out, I’ll be content!” Shui Li urged Fuxingyue, his heart aching. His daughter had not chosen wrongly.

At this point, the merfolk were in惨烈 despair, with nearly half their kin dead or captured.

“Don’t worry. I still have a chance!” Fuxingyue rose slowly, his voice laced with resolve. He believed Luo Tian would not abandon him.

“Kill!” But before the early-stage Immortal King could act, two half-step Immortal Kings lunged at Fuxingyue.

“Star Dance!” Fuxingyue bellowed, his body radiating immense power. His dimmed Star Moon Divine Spear flared with a blinding light, sweeping in a circle to strike the two half-step Immortal Kings.

“Wum…” The divine aura was overwhelming, shaking the heavens like the weapons of ancient kings.

“Even a wounded half-step Immortal King can unleash such power! Truly formidable!” The Shark Clan warriors marveled, their own divine light flashing as they countered the onslaught.

“Boom!” The two half-step Immortal Kings halted, coughing blood in disbelief as they gazed at Fuxingyue.

“Again!” Fuxingyue roared, his power surging. The Star Moon Divine Spear erupted again, this time launched directly at the two half-step Immortal Kings.

“Open!” The Shark Clan warriors bellowed, no longer holding back. Their previous strike had wounded them.

“Roar…” Two sharks materialized, the two half-step Immortal Kings transforming into their true forms—white scales covering their massive bodies. They radiated divine light.

“Boom boom…” The clash of divine energy and the two white sharks sent scales flying, blood spilling as the sharks collapsed.

Fuxingyue’s face was pale, coughing up blood. He glared at the two white sharks, barking: “Come on, you two sea fish!”

“Remarkable. One who endured two early-stage Immortal King attacks and wounded two half-step Immortal Kings!” The onlookers murmured, captivated by Fuxingyue’s battle.

“But clearly, he used some special method. Now he’s at his limit!” They whispered, watching Fuxingyue’s pale face.

“Can you fight again?” The two sharks swished their tails, hovering as if swimming. They lunged at Fuxingyue.

“Bro-in-law, I can’t hold on much longer!” Fuxingyue cried, his voice weary.

“Nobody can save you!” The sharks roared, their forms instantly before Fuxingyue. Their sharp teeth snapped toward him.

“Who said you couldn’t be saved?” A cold voice echoed as the void shattered. Two fists slammed into the sharks’ mouths.

“Crack…” The sharks flew back, crashing to the ground. Their sharp teeth vanished.

Fuxingyue disappeared from sight, and Luo Tian appeared in his place, his body radiating demonic patterns.

“Switching!” The crowd gasped, rubbing their eyes in disbelief at Luo Tian’s overwhelming presence.

“What happened?” They were bewildered, unsure why Fuxingyue had become Luo Tian.

“Wum…” Luo Tian ignored their shock, vanishing from his spot to appear before the two sharks he had knocked out. Two steps later, he crushed them into blood mist.

“Truly don’t want to face an early-stage Immortal King!” Luo Tian sighed, watching the two Shark Clan early-stage Immortal Kings reengage with Shui Li. He leapt into the air, charging toward the early-stage Immortal King Fuxingyue had fought.

“My god, he’s going to fight an early-stage Immortal King too?” The crowd gasped. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to share Fuxingyue’s resolve.

“Yueming, can Luo Da Ge do it?” On the Supreme Stone, Fuxingyue and Shui Yunqian stood. Shui Yunqian’s face was worried, questioning Fuxingyue—Fuxingyue had been crushed so hard by the early-stage Immortal King.

“Another fool!” The early-stage Immortal King sneered, watching Luo Tian charge toward him.

“Wum…” But before the crowd could react, Luo Tian’s form appeared before the early-stage Immortal King. Five fists converged, striking the warrior.

“Hmph?” The early-stage Immortal King’s brows twitched. His eyes shifted, and he struck back.

“Boom!” Luo Tian’s body landed on the ground again. The early-stage Immortal King was thrown back, his eyes wide with disbelief.

A gasp echoed as everyone stared at Luo Tian’s cracked body.

“Slightly weaker than Fu Tiankui!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit with relief, sensing this early-stage Immortal King was weaker than Fu Tiankui. Perhaps it was due to Shui Li’s prior clash, or the hasty counterattack.

“This is interesting!” Luo Tian leapt again, Longyuan in hand, charging toward the early-stage Immortal King.

“Overconfident!” The middle-aged man’s face darkened, but his blue sword flared with divine light, his expression more solemn.

“Wum…” The heavy Longyuan descended, clashing with the blue sword. Luo Tian clashed with the middle-aged man.

“This… how? A half-step Immortal King fighting an early-stage one. Who could do this? It’s against all logic!” The crowd was unsettled, watching Luo Tian as if he were a god.

“Shark Tide Storm!” The early-stage Immortal King’s face twisted with frustration. He unleashed his ultimate technique, aiming to end Luo Tian and regain dignity.

Chapter 2347: Despair

“Remember, the one who kills you is the Shark Clan. Shark Tongtian. Even if you hold a prestigious position in the Nine Heavens of Immortals, your death here is meaningless!” The early-stage Immortal King’s pressure descended, enveloping a thousand-mile radius in his domain.

“Rippling… rippling…” Water sounds echoed as Shark Tongtian’s domain filled with water. His hands glowed with divine light, sending countless white sharks toward Luo Tian.

As the lights approached, they transformed into dozens of white sharks with sharp teeth, their cold glint making Luo Tian doubt if even a few could harm his body.

“Ten… a thousand…” Countless sharks flew from Shark Tongtian’s hands, rushing toward Luo Tian.

Instantly, the sharks surrounded Luo Tian. His face darkened—here in the sea, his power was hindered. He swung Longyuan, cutting down sharks relentlessly.

But the number was overwhelming. Even Luo Tian couldn’t kill them all. Sharks began biting his body.

“No solution unless an Immortal King中期 crushes them instantly. Otherwise, you’ll be bitten to death!” Shark Tongtian smirked, watching Luo Tian’s body marked with red.

“Pity a brilliant genius. Probably from the Nine Heavens of Immortals, and his status there must be high!” The crowd murmured, their eyes filled with sorrow.

“Deserved! Who else but humans deserve death!” Those who hated humans gloated.

“No solution?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with a sneer. He activated the Heaven-Devouring Dao and the Body of the Universe. At first, he was stunned by the technique, but after some injuries, he found a way to break it. This method was difficult for other half-step Immortal Kings but manageable for Luo Tian.

“Boom…” A massive body appeared, black scales covering it. No matter how the sharks bit, they couldn’t harm Luo Tian’s body. His ten-thousand-foot form nearly touched the domain’s edge. He sneered, his fists—enhanced by Heaven-Devouring Dao—smashed against the domain’s edge.

“Boom…” The water in the domain roared violently. Though invisible, it sent out a tremor.

The clash shattered countless sharks into divine laws scattered in the water.

“Impossible!” Shark Tongtian’s face darkened. He could clearly feel his domain being shaken.

As Shark Tongtian was stunned, Luo Tian’s second punch smashed down, snapping him back to reality.

“Damn it! He must have studied my domain. Otherwise, how could he shake it?” Shark Tongtian’s face was grim. His body shifted into his true form—a hundred-foot-long blue shark, fierce and mighty.

“Boom boom…” Luo Tian’s蛮七踏 advanced, his massive body charging toward the blue shark.

“Wum…” The blue shark showed no fear. Its tail lashed out, colliding with Luo Tian’s foot. The shark was fast, appearing before Luo Tian’s body to bite down.

“Sss…” Luo Tian inhaled sharply, being torn by Shark Tongtian’s bite.

“Delicious!” The shark spoke, its body glowing with divine light. It swam again, and the smaller sharks, stimulated, rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Open!” Luo Tian roared, repeatedly striking the domain to break it. Once broken, Shark Tongtian’s technique would be defeated. His feet also moved, stomping on Shark Tongtian to prevent further flesh consumption.

Time passed. After half a bell, under Luo Tian’s efforts, the domain covering a thousand miles shattered with a loud crash. His divine body also collapsed.

“Rippling… rippling…” The water surged as the domain shattered. The sharks disappeared with the water, turning into divine laws.

“This could be broken?” The crowd gasped, watching Luo Tian still standing. But now he was battered, his body covered in wounds, as if gnawed by dogs. Some wounds even exposed white bones.

“Immortals are truly no pushovers!” Luo Tian sighed. Though he had broken Shark Tongtian’s technique, the continuous bites left him injured.

“Kid, you’re the first to bring me this far!” Shark Tongtian’s form appeared. His eyes looked at Luo Tian, a hint of admiration.

“Still, your flesh is delicious. I won’t kill you. I’ll savor it slowly!” Shark Tongtian, pale but in better condition than Luo Tian, said.

“Boom…” As he spoke, Shark Tongtian’s body rushed toward Luo Tian. His sword flashed, slicing at him.

“I’ll hold on a little longer! I can’t sacrifice my life for the merfolk!” Luo Tian shouted at Shui Li. He couldn’t die for them, but he had already held off an early-stage Immortal King for so long.

Shui Changkong and Shui Li heard Luo Tian’s shout but were too preoccupied to help. They could only endure bitterly.

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, Longyuan in hand, clashing with Shark Tongtian again. This time, however, he was overwhelmed and retreated.

“Kid, you’re still so arrogant! Want to fight me? I’ll keep you as a pet and take your flesh daily!” Shark Tongtian laughed wildly, watching Luo Tian spit blood.

“变态，老东西，你别逼我!” Luo Tian cursed, striking repeatedly. This was not the Immortal Realm; he could fight freely.

“I’ll force you!” Shark Tongtian sneered. At this state, he believed he had Luo Tian trapped.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian was stuck, Shui Li and Shui Changkong were also struggling. The merfolk’s situation was deteriorating, being slaughtered and captured.

“White Shark, don’t you fear I’ll escape and harm your clan later?” Shui Changkong shouted, his voice desperate. Watching the merfolk being killed broke his heart.

“Escape? You won’t get far! I wouldn’t have attacked the merfolk without a plan. I’ve ensured no escape!” White Shark sneered, his shark bone sword carving deep gashes on Shui Changkong.

“Do you have another trick?” Shui Changkong’s face darkened. Though he was outmatched, he could still escape. If he escaped, it would be a major problem for the Shark Clan.

That was why Shui Changkong believed the Shark Clan only wanted to extort the merfolk, waiting for their surrender. He hadn’t expected White Shark to attack immediately without any intention of letting him escape.

“Old man, can you stop me?” Shui Changkong roared, swinging a whip at White Shark while dodging to the distance.

“Haha! Shui Changkong, you still want to finish this?” As Shui Changkong tried to flee, a voice echoed. A figure blocked his path.

A man in pale blue robes stood before him, with two white tusks on his forehead. His body was massive, and his eyes held disdain.

“Whale Elephant!” Shui Changkong’s face darkened. This old man was also an Immortal King中期.

“Roar…” Water sounds echoed again as massive bodies appeared in the merfolk’s territory.

“Another dominant force, the Whale Elephant! It’s over for the merfolk!” The crowd gasped, already thinking of how to submit to these two clans. After all, the merfolk were doomed, and these two would divide their waters.

“Did you collude beforehand?” Shui Changkong’s heart sank. He looked at the Whale Elephant and White Shark surrounding him.

“Correct. The merfolk are too troublesome. What do you say, Shui Changkong? You have only one path: submit! Become our vassals. Your people can be used as good furnaces, not wasted!” The Whale Elephant roared, joining the battle.

Shui Changkong, already outmatched by White Shark, was now crushed by both. He spat blood, powerless.

“Over… completely over!” Luo Tian sighed internally, sensing the danger of Xuantian Sea. Immortal King中期, whether in the Immortal Realm or Hell, were great powers. The Eight Heavenly Kings of Hell held supreme positions; if one fell, it would shake Hell. But in Xuantian Sea, two Immortal King中期 could easily annihilate one without anyone intervening.

Luo Tian had already decided to flee. At this point, he was barely holding off Shark Tongtian and couldn’t help the merfolk.

Chapter 2348: Xuantian Sea Palace Envoy

As the merfolk faced annihilation, several figures approached their territory from tens of thousands of miles away. They stepped on the waves, flying toward the merfolk’s domain.

They wore white robes—three elders and a youth. Their presence was formidable, especially the three elders who moved like teleportation, leaving no ripples on the sea.

“Shui Wu Xing, this visit to your home will be well received,” one elder said, smiling.

“Respectful elders, my father would be delighted to know I’m alive. He’ll surely please you!” The youth replied respectfully, his eyes filled with excitement and emotion.

“A hundred years. My father never expected me to enter the Xuantian Sea Palace!”

“My sister must have grown into a beauty by now!” The youth thought, his speed increasing.

...

The slaughter continued. Merfolk bodies littered the battlefield, some crying out in agony. Others went mad from fear—everyone knew the merfolk were doomed.

Even if the Shark Clan alone attacked, some might escape. But with the Whale Elephant joining, no chance remained.

Crushing, total crushing—no aspect was spared. Luo Tian clashed with Shark Tongtian, his body battered to the brink of breaking.

“Kid, how about submitting? Live like a dog!” Shark Tongtian struck repeatedly, forcing Luo Tian back.

“Old dog! You dare ask me to submit? Today I’ll kill you. You’re the first Immortal King I’ve slain!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty, cornered and determined to strike one last blow before leaving.

The sword soared across the sky. Luo Tian’s eyes were cold, his body surging with demonic energy through eight ghost veins into the Mingmo Sword. He chanted a seal on it.

“Boom…” The sword’s power swept across, distorting the surrounding void. People within ten thousand feet paused, their gazes turning to Luo Tian.

“This technique is no simple one!” Shark Tongtian’s face shifted, sensing a grave danger from Luo Tian’s sword.

“I don’t believe you, a mere half-step Immortal King, can still have tricks after such injuries!” Shark Tongtian sneered, his sword blazing with divine light as he summoned it.

“Divine energy condensed into a sword?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, but he continued pouring demonic energy into the Mingmo Sword.

Luo Tian also had confidence. He had never seen the true power of One Strike to Kill, as each use drained his body like a bottomless pit. Since entering the Immortal Realm, he hadn’t used it for a long time—his anticipation was high. Could his current strength kill or wound an early-stage Immortal King?

“Boom boom boom…” The thunderous sound echoed within Luo Tian’s body. His demonic energy surged into the Mingmo Sword, his body nearly withered as he reached peak power. An overwhelming aura erupted from the sword.

The wind blew, tossing Luo Tian’s torn robes. His wounded body radiated a terrifying presence.

“One Strike to Kill!” Luo Tian roared, holding the sword and slashing at Shark Tongtian.

“I…” Shark Tongtian tried to shout but found himself unable to speak under the pressure. He countered with his own divine energy.

“Wum…” The void shattered, seemingly nothing happened, but the crowd watched in awe.

“Crack…” As they marveled, two sword beams collided. The sound of thunder echoed as the beams clashed.

“Break…” A breaking sound rang out. Shark Tongtian’s beam shattered, and a black beam appeared before him, making his face twist in horror.

Death threat. Shark Tongtian’s heart clenched. On that black beam, he felt an irresistible power capable of killing him.

“Ah…” Shark Tongtian roared. He never expected a half-step Immortal King to create such danger.

Death, Shark Tongtian unleashed his power. His body transformed into its true form, covered in scales, hoping to block the killing beam.

“Plop…” Shark Tongtian’s body flew thousands of feet before stopping. Though he was an Immortal King, this strike hadn’t fully blocked One Strike to Kill but had saved him a sliver of life.

“Boom…” His ten-thousand-foot body fell to the ground, a deep wound nearly splitting him in two. Blood gushed around him.

“Dead fish! Get up!” A cold voice echoed as the Mingmo Sword descended, piercing Shark Tongtian’s head.

“Unbelievable!”

“To kill an early-stage Immortal King with a half-step one? How is this possible!” The crowd was stunned, as if in a dream, unable to believe their eyes.

The cold sword pierced Shark Tongtian’s massive head. His blue eyes closed, filled with intense regret.

“Truly killed…” After tens of breaths, the crowd regained their senses. They watched Luo Tian standing with the Mingmo Sword.

Many Shark Clan warriors were stunned, and above, Bai Sha and Whale Elephant—Immortal Kings—were equally shocked.

“Kill him. He’s no longer a threat!” Bai Sha snapped, his voice fierce. The Shark Clan had only two early-stage Immortal Kings; losing one was painful, and even more so that it was killed by a human, a half-step Immortal King.

“Kill…” Upon hearing Bai Sha’s command, a Shark Clan half-step Immortal King rushed toward Luo Tian. Even a fool could see Luo Tian was exhausted, and victory was near—who wouldn’t want it?

“I did my best!” Luo Tian sighed longingly, ignoring the half-step Immortal King charging at him. He gazed across the battlefield, now nearing its end. The merfolk were dead or captured.

Shui Li was wounded, beaten to the ground by a Whale Elephant early-stage Immortal King and couldn’t rise.

Shui Changkong’s situation was dire, a picture of imminent death.

“Die!” The Whale Elephant struck, his heavy aura shattering the sky and crushing Shui Changkong.

“End of my merfolk!” Shui Changkong’s despair filled him. He spat blood, falling from the sky with a deathly face.

“I surrender! Don’t kill me. I’ll enter the Xuantian Sea Palace later, you can’t kill me!” Bao Long shouted, his voice filled with fear. He was terrified—originally he thought he’d ascend smoothly into the Xuantian Sea Palace, but who could have foreseen this disaster?

“Haha! It’s too late to surrender. But I’ll give you a chance—kill him yourself, and I’ll let you live!” A Shark Clan early-stage Immortal King laughed, stomping on Shui Li’s back and shouting at Bao Long.

“I…” Bao Long paused, wiping blood from his face. His gaze fell on Shui Li underfoot.

“You have three seconds to decide. If you hesitate, both of you die!” The middle-aged man smiled.

“One…” He counted immediately. Bao Long was startled.

“I’ll kill him!” As the man finished counting, Bao Long roared. His bloodied sword raised toward Shui Li.

“Monster!” Shui Li, already wounded, was enraged. Seeing Bao Long’s agreement, he spat blood and nearly fainted.

Bao Long was raised by Shui Li. Shui Li had treated him like a son, even giving up the chance for Shui Yunqian to enter the Xuantian Sea Palace in favor of Bao Long. He never expected his own son to betray him, killing him for survival.

“Master, I have no choice. You’ll die anyway. Let me help you!” Bao Long’s eyes flashed with madness, his gaze terrifying.

“That’s right!” The middle-aged man smiled. Even if Bao Long killed Shui Li, he wouldn’t let him live.

“This is a bastard. I truly can’t help now!” Luo Tian sighed, now focusing on preserving the merfolk’s bloodline—Shui Yunqian.

At this moment, Luo Tian activated the Supreme Stone. The Shark Clan warrior had already reached him.

“Wum…” The bloodied sword raised, Bao Long swung it toward Shui Li’s head.

“Shui Li, dare you!” A furious shout echoed. A streak of light slashed Bao Long’s arm.

Chapter 2349: End

Divine light flashed, severing Bao Long’s arm and sword.

“Boom boom boom…” Several figures broke through the bloodstained water, their presence overwhelming. Everyone’s faces shifted slightly.

White robes radiated divine aura. Three elders and a youth appeared, leaving everyone in disbelief.

“This robe… it’s the Xuantian Sea Palace!” Someone gasped, halting the Shark Clan and Whale Elephant.

“Wu Xing!” Shui Li’s eyes widened. He gazed at the youth behind the three elders—Shui Wu Xing, his son.

Shui Wu Xing had vanished years ago when a trench in the merfolk’s territory was discovered. The merfolk believed him dead. That’s why Shui Li had nurtured Bao Long as his son, treating him like family. No one expected Shui Wu Xing to return after a century—wearing the Xuantian Sea Palace’s robe.

“Little Master Wu Xing!” The merfolk gazed in awe. Some young ones had never seen him, only heard of his name. None dared mention it, fearing Shui Li’s sorrow.

“Shui Wu Xing! How is this possible!” Bao Long stared, forgetting his severed arm’s pain. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian and Fuxingyue, who had landed on the Supreme Stone, cursed under their breath. Three elders—one Immortal King中期 and two early-stage—and one of the early-stage was familiar to Luo Tian. It was Xiang Tianming, whom he had met in the Dead Sea. He had planned to check that location but hadn’t expected to meet Xiang Tianming here.
