“Sigh!” The sound of a sharp intake of breath echoed, and Kong Deming was no exception; his eyes reflected disbelief.

“Five! Five colors!” The people could not believe their eyes, rubbing them in astonishment. They knew what five colors signified; they stared at Luo Tian, who had repeatedly shattered their expectations.

“Five Elements Body!” The sect masters in the rear courtyard of the Five Elements Sect also bore expressions of shock.

“This time, none of you will compete with me!” An old man shouted, his eyes red as he turned and barked.

Yet when he looked back, the space behind him was empty—no one remained.

“Damn it!” The old man stamped his foot, causing the surrounding buildings to tremble slightly. Then, a pair of massive purple-black wings unfurled from his back, and he vanished in an instant, leaving a whirlwind of wind.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt unwell; the surrounding energy was far from sufficient to propel his breakthrough into the sixth stage of body refinement. His eyes reflected disappointment.

“Previously, you aided me; now it’s my turn!” Gu Qianxue’s soft voice whispered into Luo Tian’s ear.

Luo Tian shuddered as a warm palm pressed against his back, and threads of fire-wood attribute energy seeped into his body.

Luo Tian turned to face Gu Qianxue, a look of gratitude on his face. Though energy could be cultivated back, Gu Qianxue had only just entered the fifth stage of body refinement; her cultivation was unstable. If she continued, she might plummet back to the fourth stage.

“Stop it! It’s useless!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out as he watched Gu Qianxue endlessly channel energy into him.

“No!” Gu Qianxue simply uttered one word, her eyes resolute and unmoving.

“Stubborn girl!” Luo Tian let out a bitter laugh.

“Fine, I won’t back down today—I’ll break through this sixth stage of body refinement!” Luo Tian’s eyes hardened, no longer resisting. He began to merge the energy Gu Qianxue had provided.

Time passed in agonizing increments; Gu Qianxue’s face grew pale, her energy nearly depleted. She could collapse into the fourth stage at any moment.

“I must help him! Even if I fall back to the fourth stage, it’s worth it!” Gu Qianxue’s face was ashen. She clutched a “Burst Body Pill.”

“Girl, let go! Leave the rest to us!” Just as Gu Qianxue was about to swallow the pill, a woman’s voice rang out.

Gu Qianxue shuddered; a surge of powerful wood attribute energy flowed into her body, reviving her withered meridians.

“Hmph! Why is there a winged person in the sky?” Someone murmured in the crowd.

Kong Deming glanced upward, his eyes widening in shock before he and his disciples bowed deeply: “Golden Light Sect’s outer sect elder Kong Deming pays homage to the sect masters!”

As Kong Deming’s words faded, people gazed upward at the flying figures. Their eyes brimmed with reverence.

“Nascent Soul Realm!” In the Tianyuan Continent, a Nascent Soul Realm adept could dominate unchallenged. A single Nascent Soul Realm master could sustain a second-rate sect, like Feiyun Sect, which relied on its Nascent Soul Realm master.

Yet today, five Nascent Soul Realm masters had appeared—people marveled at the talent of the Five Elements Body, and it was clear that even the sect masters had come to claim Luo Tian.

Above, the five figures extended their hands; five-colored energy surged like dragons from their fingers, rushing into Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian, who had already resigned himself to defeat, accepted this gift. His eyes narrowed as he barked: “Sixth stage of body refinement! Open!”

As Luo Tian’s command echoed, a towering aura formed around him, billowing his robes like waves. It seemed as if the world stood only for Luo Tian.

Gu Qianxue, standing before him, felt the pressure of the heavenly ladder vanish; her body lightened.

Kong Deming’s disciple Zhang Daoyi’s face darkened. He had never imagined that a mere disciple would become the legendary Five Elements Body, and now even the sect masters had aided Luo Tian’s breakthrough.

“Your treachery is too much!” A furious voice rang out, interwoven with the sound of breaking air. A group of figures with purple-black wings arrived in an instant.

“Haha, Wu Ping’an, your speed is slow—blame others!” An old man mocked.

“Hmph, Master Siti, it seems you’re about to have a stomachache!” Wu Ping’an retorted with mockery.

“Enough! We’re all here for this youth. Let’s discuss where he should be placed!” The woman intervened, steering the conversation back to Luo Tian.

“Hmph! He belongs under my Inferno Sect! My Eight Directions Fire Dragon Technique finally has an heir! Haha!” Master Siti Anle of the Inferno Sect laughed.

“What’s so impressive? My Golden Light Sect is more suitable! My Poison Sect is even better!” The others quickly quarreled like children, ignoring the stunned crowd below.

“Is this what the Five Elements Sect’s masters are like? They act like common rascals!” The people were astonished. They hadn’t expected the sect masters to value the Five Elements Body so much they nearly fought over it.

Luo Tian watched the Nascent Soul Realm masters vying for him, thinking: If they knew he had already joined Dan Sect, would they storm it immediately?

Chapter 29: Five Elements Sect Master

“You’re making a mockery of protocol! Where is your dignity as sect masters? You act like common rascals in front of so many people!” A stern voice echoed. An old man in green robes flew toward them from afar.

Hearing the authoritative tone, the sect masters fell silent instantly, respectfully gazing at the old man who had arrived before them.

“Hail the Sect Master!” They bowed slightly.

“What? Did I hear correctly? The Five Elements Sect’s Sect Master! I not only saw the sect masters but also the Sect Master himself! My heavens, I must tell my father—no longer will he boast about meeting the Red Fire Sect’s Sect Master!” A young man who had climbed two hundred levels of the heavenly ladder muttered.

Kong Deming was also shaken; he had seen the Sect Master only a few times. Yet an ordinary disciple had drawn the attention of the Sect Master himself.

Kong Deming dared not speak, lacking the right to do so. He and Zhang Daoyi knelt on the ground with his disciples, awaiting Wei Mingxuan’s words.

Luo Tian watched the scene escalate, inwardly groaning. He prayed his mysterious master, Dan Sect’s Sect Master, would appear among them; otherwise, he had no idea how to survive this day.

“Hmph! Your talent is barely worth mentioning—what good disciples could you produce?” Wei Mingxuan’s voice rang out.

Hearing this, the sect masters felt a sudden unease.

“Old man, I’ve never taken disciples. Today, none of you will compete with me—I intend to take this youth as my sole disciple!” Wei Mingxuan’s calm voice rang out.

“Shameless! Truly shameless! Every time, you dismiss them, but when you take an interest, another old man snatches them away!” The sect masters thought in unison.

Gazing at the resolute Five Elements Sect Master, the sect masters’ faces twitched. Yet his words were true; they could not afford to offend their Sect Master’s dignity, lest it damage the Five Elements Sect’s reputation.

“Five Elements Sect Master’s sole disciple!” Wei Mingxuan’s voice was unambiguous; all heard it clearly.

Everyone envied Luo Tian, whose status as the Sect Master’s disciple would grant him unchallenged power in the Northern Domain. With a single word, he could destroy small sects. And as the sole disciple, Luo Tian was likely to become the next Five Elements Sect Master.

Luo Tian’s heart pounded; if he hadn’t had that mysterious master, he would have been overjoyed. Now, however, he felt no joy at all.

“Wherever he goes, he shines! Whether in Tianyuan City or the Five Elements Sect, which is far stronger!” Gu Qianxue thought with admiration.

“Did you see that? He’s my brother!” Gu Lei shouted to the side.

“Hmph! If he were your brother, I’d call you father!” A young man stared at Gu Lei as if he were a fool.

“Is that true?” Gu Lei’s interest piqued, and he approached the one who mocked him.

“Hmph! I don’t have time for you, nutcase!” The young man dismissed him with a glance.

“Hmph! You’ll wait—when he comes down, he’ll find me!” Gu Lei’s face turned red from irritation, but he was met with more glares.

Zhang Hongyun felt reluctant as Luo Tian’s spotlight shone. Everyone’s eyes were on Luo Tian, ignoring that Zhang Hongyun had reached eight hundred and fifty levels. Today, he should have been the most radiant figure, but now Luo Tian had stolen the spotlight.

Feng Qianyu paid no heed and continued climbing the steps, his eyes fixed solely on the heavenly ladder.

The third black-cloaked youth watched Luo Tian, his eyes betraying an unreadable expression. His lips curled into a faint smile.

Luo Tian, under so many gazes, felt his face heat up—especially the Nascent Soul Realm masters above. Though they didn’t pressure him, they were beings capable of blowing him away with a single breath.

“What is your name?” Wei Mingxuan asked seriously; he needed to confirm Luo Tian’s identity before taking him as a disciple.

“Respectful junior, Luo Tian, currently residing in the Gu Family of Tianyuan City.” Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

“Ah, would you like to be my disciple?” Wei Mingxuan continued, clearly regarding Luo Tian as his own. His eyes softened slightly.

“Ah… junior, actually…” Luo Tian stammered, unsure how to respond.

“A man of courage should speak plainly! Don’t be so hesitant!” Wei Mingxuan’s expression darkened slightly, showing impatience at Luo Tian’s hesitation.

“Sect Master, this youth has already joined our Dan Sect!” A clear voice rang out, sounding quite young.

The voice’s source was a thirty-year-old man accompanied by a robust youth and another in black robes. They approached the heavenly ladder, shouting toward the sky.

“Who is this? Daring to speak so boldly to the Sect Master! Doesn’t he know he’s risking his life?” Murmurs of disbelief spread through the crowd.

But after their doubts, people witnessed an unforgettable scene: The leader’s back emitted a surge of energy. Two massive wings unfolded, and he levitated toward Wei Mingxuan and the sect masters.

“My heavens! This youth is also a Nascent Soul Realm adept! How young!” The crowd gasped, their heads spinning from the shock.

“Zhang Ziping!” Wei Mingxuan muttered, his headache deepening. He hadn’t expected Dan Sect to learn of this so soon.

The other sect masters saw Zhang Ziping’s arrival and smirked, but then their expressions turned to schadenfreude.

Luo Tian saw the newcomers and felt a flicker of relief—Zhang Ziping’s two companions were Lei Yong and Ji Chen, who had been with him in Tianyuan City. He sighed inwardly; the rest was out of his hands now.

Zhang Daoyi clenched his teeth, cursing inwardly. Luo Tian had become a prize too quickly for his plans to proceed.

Dan Sect’s sect master lineage was a special presence within the Five Elements Sect, with only three disciples currently. Yet their reputation was formidable.

Zhang Ziping, the eldest disciple, possessed a three-element body and was thirty-one years old. His Nascent Soul Realm status made him an exceptional talent, ensuring Dan Sect’s standing even without his master.

Lei Yong, the second disciple, had a lightning-element body and was the top of the Five Elements Sect’s bone-formation stage. Ji Chen, the third disciple, had a dark-element body and often ranked second with Lei Yong in bone-formation stage.

These three disciples of Dan Sect were each more extraordinary than the last, and today’s attempt to recruit Luo Tian as their fourth disciple revealed his terrifying talent.

Among the crowd, Zhang Qi, battered and bruised, retreated silently. He knew he must inform his father of today’s events immediately; Luo Tian was no longer a threat to the Xuantian City.

Chapter 30: Star of the Age

“Ziping, was it your master who sent you?” Wei Mingxuan asked the young man he had once considered taking as a disciple.

“Yes, my master discovered Luo Tian during his travels in Tianyuan City and took him as a disciple,” Zhang Ziping replied respectfully.

Wei Mingxuan’s brow furrowed, as if pondering something. Yet the Golden Light Sect master behind him snorted: “Dan Sect’s old man hasn’t been seen in years. How can you be sure he took Luo Tian as a disciple?”

Zhang Ziping smiled but said nothing. His hands subtly produced a scroll-like object, which he slowly unfurled.

Golden light spilled from the scroll as an ancient figure appeared before them—his white hair contrasted with his ageless face.

“Sect Master, this youth is already my disciple. I don’t seek to compete with you; this matter involves something crucial! Please grant me a favor, and I promise not to contest with you again,” the old man said before vanishing.

Wei Mingxuan gazed at the old man with respect, then waved his hand: “After the trial is complete, Luo Tian will be Dan Sect’s disciple.”

With Wei Mingxuan’s decision, the sect masters said nothing more. Yet they were slightly discontent with Dan Sect’s arrogance. However, recalling the old man’s terrifying power, they left reluctantly.

Luo Tian marveled at the young Nascent Soul Realm warrior before him, stunned by his youth. This man must be his senior brother.

“Good! My master isn’t in Dan Sect; once you complete the trial, go to Dan Sect. I’ll answer your questions later,” Zhang Ziping said kindly before departing.

“Little brother, we’re watching you!” Lei Yong’s deep voice rang out; he and Ji Chen remained below, shouting loudly. Their voices shook the crowd, but no one dared protest due to Lei Yong’s bone-formation stage.

As the Nascent Soul Realm masters departed, the crowd sighed in relief; today’s events had been overwhelming.

Even the sect masters were impressed—someone had refused the Sect Master’s sole disciple to choose another sect, even Dan Sect. In their eyes, no one could rival the allure of being the Sect Master’s disciple.

After the awe faded, people turned their attention to the youth who had caused such a stir. Yet this youth moved forward as if nothing had happened, slowly lifting his leg to climb.

At that moment, people noticed the others still on the heavenly ladder and fell silent.

Zhang Hongyun’s face was bitter; today had been a crushing blow. With Luo Tian’s emergence, all eyes were drawn to him. When people returned their gaze to the heavenly ladder, Zhang Hongyun had dropped from first to third place.

Indeed, Zhang Hongyun now ranked third; Feng Qianyu had overtaken him, and the black-cloaked youth had gradually surpassed him. Zhang Hongyun could not accept this.

Luo Tian glanced at the three ahead of him, his eyes igniting with battle spirit. Though his body was extraordinary, if he lost here, he would be mocked and disgrace his senior brothers. Thinking this, Luo Tian quickened his pace to catch up.

“Seven hundred and fifty!”
“Eight hundred!”
“Eight hundred and fifty!” Luo Tian accelerated, the heavenly ladder’s pressure vanishing as he reached eight hundred and fifty levels.

“Look! Luo Tian has reached eight hundred and fifty! With his sixth stage of body refinement, he’s achieved this—his Five Elements Body is truly terrifying!” The crowd murmured.

In truth, Luo Tian was not as effortless as he seemed; his body was drenched in sweat. The pressure at eight hundred and fifty levels had increased significantly.

“Hmph! I’m a genius too; I can’t lose! I planned to reveal my dual-element body at the end, but now it’s impossible. Even if I lose, I’ll do so brilliantly!” Zhang Hongyun roared, unleashing his power. Two energies—yellow and green—coiled around him to resist the pressure, propelling him upward.

“Unexpectedly, Zhang Hongyun is also a dual-element genius. He didn’t reveal his gold element before, clearly holding back. Regretfully, without Luo Tian, he would have been the most radiant this time!” The crowd marveled.

Feng Qianyu saw Zhang Hongyun’s power surge and smiled, releasing two energies—red and blue—from his body. Like Zhang Hongyun, Feng Qianyu was also a dual-element genius.

The black-cloaked youth who had followed behind cast a glance back, smiling faintly as a gray aura spread around him.

Kong Deming was stunned by the four youths on the heavenly ladder. In his years at the Five Elements Sect, he had never seen so many geniuses gather to join. Previously, discovering a dual-element body would spark fierce competition among sects.

A gold-wood element Zhang Hongyun, a water-fire element Feng Qianyu, and the mysterious gray aura of the black-cloaked youth—alongside Gu Qianxue’s wood-fire element, this was already four geniuses. Besides Luo Tian’s Five Elements Body, there were four more.

The crowd below sighed; their journey had not been in vain. Witnessing so many geniuses and the Sect Master and sect masters made it worthwhile.

Yet the four youths on the heavenly ladder ignored the crowd’s thoughts, gritting their teeth and climbing.

After eight hundred and fifty levels, the distance between them was minimal—no more than twenty steps. With Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu’s power surges, the gap with the first-place black-cloaked youth was now only three or four steps.

“Want to bring me down? Prove yourself?” Luo Tian chuckled, surrounding his body with five-colored energy and accelerating.

“Alas… Dan Sect has taken him again! If he were under my Inferno Sect, it would have been better!” Siti Anle sighed. The sect masters shared his sentiment.

“My heavens! This Luo Tian is变态 (abnormal)! Even under these conditions, he can accelerate—how could a Five Elements Body withstand it? He’s only at the sixth stage of body refinement!” Another murmur spread.

Luo Tian’s speed increased, instantly closing the gap with Zhang Hongyun.

Zhang Hongyun felt resentment; though he wished to accelerate, his power was already exhausted and could not catch Feng Qianyu.

“Nine hundred!” Zhang Hongyun collapsed at the ninth hundred level, panting heavily.

He looked up and saw Feng Qianyu also collapsed at the ninth hundred and fifth level, clearly unable to proceed further.

“This time, I’ve won!” Feng Qianyu weakly smiled, a streak of blood at his lips.

The black-cloaked youth sat at the ninth hundred and twentieth level, meditating—whether he had remaining strength was unknown.

“Eight hundred and ninety-nine! Nine hundred!” Luo Tian’s forehead veins bulged as he slowly stepped onto the ninth hundred level, yet his mind was fixated on counting numbers.

“Too abnormal! These people are truly abnormal! I heard no one has reached the ninth hundred level in a long time!” A youth, his face alight with fervor, gazed at the four youths, admiration on his face.

Chapter 31: You Dare! I Dare!

In the rear courtyard of the Five Elements Sect, the sect masters were also exhilarated, each scheming to recruit the other three youths besides Luo Tian.

Geniuses were the foundation of any sect, and a single outstanding genius could stabilize an entire sect. Like Dan Sect, though its master was absent, Zhang Ziping’s presence ensured no one dared challenge it.

Luo Tian stepped toward Feng Qianyu, whom he genuinely liked for his persistence. Yet they had no deep connection; Luo Tian merely offered a kind glance.

Seeing the kindness, Feng Qianyu smiled back—though his face was slightly distorted from pressure.

Nodding, Luo Tian trudged forward, reaching the black-cloaked youth.

The black-cloaked youth opened his eyes upon Luo Tian’s arrival, his face alight with fierce battle spirit.

Luo Tian felt a familiar sensation in his heart, as if he had seen this gaze before.

Ignoring the black-cloaked youth, Luo Tian continued forward, gazing at the remaining forty levels. A surge of courage welled within him.

Though each step grew heavier, Luo Tian pressed on.

“Look! Luo Tian has become first!” All eyes returned to Luo Tian, this admirable man.

Zhang Hongyun gazed upward at Luo Tian, the man who had shattered his pride. A sense of helplessness filled him, yet he now harbored a glimmer of expectation—he wished to see how far this man could go.

Not only Zhang Hongyun, but the sect masters in the Five Elements Sect’s rear courtyard also bore expectant gazes. They wished to see if this legendary Five Elements Body would add another shock to people’s hearts.

The black-cloaked youth followed Luo Tian closely, never falling behind.

“Nine hundred and fifty!” Luo Tian roared, stepping onto the ninth hundred and fiftieth level. As he stepped on, his body swayed slightly; after adjusting, he stood upright.

Luo Tian had no strength to look back at the black-cloaked youth; he only gazed upward, staring at the remaining forty levels.

“Little brother, fight hard! I hope you break my record and see what the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level looks like,” Zhang Ziping sat in Dan Sect, his eyes filled with hope.

“Luo Tian has likely reached his limit; a sixth-stage body refinement to the ninth hundred and fiftieth level—this is likely the first in Five Elements Sect history!” The fire sect master gazed at Luo Tian, a hint of regret in his eyes. If Luo Tian’s power were higher, he might have gone further.

The other elders nodded in agreement, and they were surprised the black-cloaked youth had reached this far. They began to consider how to recruit him after.

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, his mind fixated on reaching the end.

“Roar…” Luo Tian roared, stepping onto the ninth hundred and fifty-first level.

“Nine hundred and fifty-one! Nine hundred and fifty-two… nine hundred and seventy-eight!” Luo Tian moved slowly, each step taking a long time. Yet he did not give up.

The black-cloaked youth behind him bore a grim expression, gritting his teeth and following Luo Tian closely.

The two seemed ready to collapse at any moment but always managed to climb the next level.

Each time they stepped onto a level, the crowd below emitted hurried breaths. No one spoke now; words failed to describe these two youths.

“Nine hundred and ninety!” The two stepped onto the ninth hundred and ninetieth level simultaneously.

As they stepped on, both bodies trembled; they fell to their knees with a dull thud.

Cracks formed on their bodies, clearly at their limits. Luo Tian forced himself to look at the black-cloaked youth beside him, his voice hoarse: “Will you continue?”

“You go; I’ll go!” The black-cloaked youth’s face was cold, his words sharp.

“Then I go!” Luo Tian said no more; the pressure was too great, and each word he spoke added to his burden. He slowly stood up, placing one foot on the ninth hundred and ninety-first level.

The black-cloaked youth did the same, placing his foot on it.

“Nine hundred and ninety-one… nine hundred and ninety-eight!” After an hour, the two stood on the ninth hundred and ninety-eighth level.

“Nine hundred and ninety-eight!” The sect masters also could not sit still; the ninth hundred and ninety-eighth level was where Zhang Ziping had reached. Lei Yong and others had stopped at around the ninth hundred and ninety-fifth level.

At this moment, both Luo Tian and the black-cloaked youth were red with blood, their skin cracked open. From a distance, they looked like bloody figures.

Luo Tian collapsed on the steps, supporting himself with his hands, his eyes wide as if they would pop out.

The crowd below gazed at the two with deep respect, different from before—this was genuine admiration. Even if Luo Tian were not a Five Elements Body, people would respect this youth.

They knew reaching this point was no longer just about physique and power but also an extraordinary will.

Luo Tian gazed at the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level, a shiver running through him. He felt that if he stepped on it, he would be crushed instantly.

The black-cloaked youth also trembled as he stared at the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level, too afraid to approach.

“Legend says no one has entered the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level since the first sect master. No one knows what happens after stepping on it,” Kong Deming murmured, unsure if he was speaking to himself or explaining to his disciples.

“Has no one entered the ninth hundred and ninety-eighth level in so many years?” A disciple behind him asked softly.

“No, according to records, thirty people once reached the ninth hundred and ninety-eighth level. But those who reached it say they lacked the courage to enter the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level,” Kong Deming recalled the records of the Five Elements Sect.

Luo Tian and the black-cloaked youth now faced this dilemma, lacking courage to confront the final step.

“Dare you?” Luo Tian asked again.

“No,” the black-cloaked youth replied honestly.

“You don’t dare, I do!” Luo Tian stood up without trembling and stepped onto the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level.

“Hush…” A wave of murmurs spread.

Under everyone’s stunned gaze, Luo Tian stepped onto the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level—never before entered by anyone.

Chapter 32: A Flicker of a Soul

In the black-cloaked youth’s trembling gaze, Luo Tian strode onto the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level. This was the step only the Five Elements Sect’s founder had ever entered.

“Not bad, my little brother! For this courage alone, I’ve decided to accept you as my brother!” Lei Yong pounded his fist.

As Zhang Ziping’s junior, he had heard of the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level’s terror from Zhang Ziping. Even Zhang Ziping had not dared enter it, so Lei Yong could only admire Luo Tian’s bravery.

Unlike Lei Yong, Ji Chen bore a worried expression. If Lei Yong saw this, he would be shocked—how could the ice-cold Ji Chen show such a look? Fortunately, Lei Yong’s attention was on the heavenly ladder and he didn’t notice Ji Chen’s expression.

Zhang Qi hid in the crowd, silently praying Luo Tian would die. Though he was a fool, it didn’t mean he was stupid; he knew if Luo Tian lived, Xuantian City would be in trouble and might even cease to exist.

The black-cloaked youth watched Luo Tian step onto the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level, biting his lip. He had tried several times to step forward but ultimately withdrew. He couldn’t help but admire Luo Tian’s courage.

Without reaching the ninth hundred and ninety-eighth level, one could never understand the terror of the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth. It felt like suicide—yet with more pressure than actual suicide.

Yet now, Luo Tian vanished from the crowd’s sight—yes, he disappeared, as if his entire body had shattered.

“No!” Gu Qianxue’s tears flowed down her face, standing at the six hundredth level. She hadn’t heard people discussing the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level’s terror; she hadn’t expected it to be life-threatening.

“Alas…” A series of long sighs echoed through the crowd.

People sighed in regret, believing this young genius would never grow up.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen also bore disbelief; they couldn’t believe their master’s chosen one would die so easily.

Zhang Qi nearly jumped for joy, his heart elated—this trouble had finally ended.

“Pity…” The sect masters all shook their heads, lamenting the death of a generation’s star.

Yet regardless, Luo Tian’s name would echo across the Northern Domain! This young genius with a sixth-stage body refinement who had entered the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level of the heavenly ladder would be etched into the Five Elements Sect’s history.

Luo Tian didn’t know the outside world had lost sight of him; he only knew he was in a mysterious space. He didn’t know its size, just that everything around him was hazy.

Luo Tian hadn’t had the courage to step onto the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level, but after deciding to give up, he noticed a rusted spearhead in his storage bag emitting a continuous hum. This gave him the courage to fight.

The result didn’t disappoint him; upon entering, no danger occurred—his body felt refreshed instead. He sensed his strength had increased significantly; this was the benefit of the heavenly ladder’s trial. He believed his body strength now rivaled the eighth stage of body refinement.

Before he could fully savor this, the rusted spearhead in his storage bag flew out on its own, moving at incredible speed forward.

Luo Tian hurriedly chased it; fortunately, his current speed was fast enough to barely catch up.

Not long after, the rusted spearhead stopped, and a black staff stood upright on the ground. It emitted欢快 (joyful) hums in response to the spearhead’s arrival.

“Could this ordinary black staff and rusted spearhead be one?” Luo Tian wondered, watching the two pieces slowly merge.

“Hum…” As the spearhead and black staff joined, the entire ninth hundred and ninety-ninth level space trembled violently. Black energy radiated from the spear.

After the black energy dissipated, the rusted spearhead’s iron rust peeled off, revealing a glint of cold light. It no longer looked broken—it was clearly an exquisite spear.

Luo Tian marveled at the spear’s transformation, surprised it had found its staff here.

“Alas… how many years…” A voice echoed through the space, resonating in the vast emptiness.

“Who!” Luo Tian was startled; he hadn’t expected another person in this mysterious space.

Under his cautious gaze, a translucent figure gradually formed beside the spear.

The figure was clearly an old man; Luo Tian felt he could pass through his body with a single hand.

Luo Tian cautiously observed the figure, recalling that some masters with transcendent power could survive as a single soul fragment, reborn through their bodies.

“Don’t be alarmed, I am merely a soul fragment; I pose no threat to you!” The soul fragment explained.

Hearing this, Luo Tian didn’t relax his vigilance; who knew how long this being had lived? His mind was far beyond a young man’s. Yet Luo Tian’s face showed respect: “I beg your pardon, but may I ask your esteemed name?”

“My name? Perhaps no one remembers me now. It’s better not to mention it. However, my martial arts must be passed on; thus, I’ve attached myself to my weapon, the Splitting Heaven Spear!” The figure spoke calmly, gazing at the Splitting Heaven Spear with a gentle expression.

Luo Tian listened to the old man’s story, admiration filling him for the elder’s persistence. For so many years as a soul fragment, he had only aimed to pass on his martial arts.

“Previously, someone else entered this space but was unsuitable for my martial arts. You are the second to reach here, and the last one. My soul energy is nearly depleted; tell me what element your body type is!” The old man spoke calmly.

“Respectful junior, I am a five-element body type!” Luo Tian said nervously, his eyes fixed on the soul fragment.
