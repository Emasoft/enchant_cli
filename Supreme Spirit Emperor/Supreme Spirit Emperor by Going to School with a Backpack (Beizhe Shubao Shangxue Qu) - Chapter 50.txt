Lu Kunpeng smiled as he gazed at Luo Tian, surprised that Luo Tian's brief outing had brought such honor to the Five Elements Sect. Observing the expressions of Gu Zhengye and others, Lu Kunpeng deduced they too likely owed Luo Tian money. Originally, the resentment from his attack blocked by the Zhenhun Ding had vanished instantly.

Cold Qiuchan's three black-cloaked subordinates also bore expressions of shock. They had no idea Luo Tian had accomplished such a feat within. Unbeknownst to them, the elixirs they used were provided by Cold Qiuchan, and those elixirs had all been given to her by Luo Tian.

"How much do you owe?" Xu Yuangliang gritted his teeth, staring at Tu Yuanyuan and Pang Haoran. He knew their spirit stone debt was no small sum, but he cared more about his dignity. Earlier, he had advised Lei Qingchuan not to be angry, but now it was his turn.

"One hundred and fifty million..."

"One hundred million..." Both spoke simultaneously.

"Buzz..." Upon hearing their figures, Xu Yuangliang nearly fainted.

"Two hundred and fifty million..." Xu Yuangliang muttered the number repeatedly, his face twitching with veins.

"Go to hell!" Xu Yuangliang finally lost control, slapping both men across the face.

The disciples of the Water Source Sect nearby trembled upon hearing their figures. None among them had ever seen such a vast amount of spirit stones; the most they'd witnessed was Lei Qingchuan's one hundred million, which had left them awestruck.

"Old Xu! This disciple might encounter troubles outside. Don't take it too hard. Let me have Luo Tian erase the remainder, okay?" Lu Kunpeng wore a comforting expression, but everyone could see his malicious joy.

"Brother Kunpeng, truly magnanimous!" Xu Yuangliang's face lit up with a smile. To him, erasing five million was still no small sum.

"Yes, since the Grand Elder spoke, let's erase the remainder," Luo Tian retrieved their IOUs as if calculating something.

"Call it what you like, Old Xu's face is still valuable!" Lu Kunpeng snatched the two IOUs from Luo Tian's hand, glanced at them, and approached Xu Yuangliang.

"Thank you, Brother Kunpeng!" His face bore gratitude.

"Yes, let me check... Pang Haoran owes one hundred and thirty-two million, Tu Yuanyuan owes one thousand five hundred and ten million. After erasing the remainder, it's two hundred and fifty million. Perfect! Old Xu, hand over the money!" Lu Kunpeng laid the two IOUs before Xu Yuangliang.

Xu Yuangliang was still calculating how to explain the two hundred and fifty million spirit stones to the sect when he heard Lu Kunpeng's words. He was about to agree, but upon recalling Lu Kunpeng's figures, he froze.

"Brother Kunpeng, didn't you say to erase the remainder?" Xu Yuangliang asked.

"Yes, we did erase it. Nearly five million!" Lu Kunpeng's face turned serious.

"Damn it!" Xu Yuangliang nearly cursed.

"Old Xu, I understand your meaning. But truly, our Five Elements Sect isn't very wealthy. Five million spirit stones are already a astronomical sum for us!" Lu Kunpeng sighed, speaking softly.

"Unwealthy? Unwealthy your mother! Who doesn't know alchemists are the richest profession? Don't cry poor in front of me!" Xu Yuangliang mentally cursed, but his face wore a fawning smile.

"This, Brother Kunpeng, I didn't bring that much spirit stones. Take it as a loan for now! When I return to the Five Elements Sect, I'll repay you. You still trust my word, right?" Lu Kunpeng looked at Luo Tian, saying this while thinking about purchasing high-grade spiritual herbs.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng's words, Luo Tian knew these spirit stones were surely wasted. When Lu Kunpeng had previously extorted his herbs, he'd often said this.

"Old Xu, isn't it time to offer something as collateral? I know you have many treasures. Just give me ten or eight of them, and it should suffice!" Lu Kunpeng ignored Luo Tian's twitching eye and addressed Xu Yuangliang.

Chapter 242: Xuan-Grade Defensive Armor

Chapter 242: Xuan-Grade Defensive Armor

Seeing Lu Kunpeng's greedy gaze, Xu Yuangliang bore a bitter expression. He knew he couldn't escape today and decided to be straightforward, raising his hand to reveal a淡蓝色 armor.

"This is my newly forged Qinglin Xianshui Armor. It should be a mid-grade Xuan-Grade defensive item, enough to cover your one hundred and fifty million spirit stones!" Xu Yuangliang's face showed reluctance, as it was his newly crafted item.

Lu Kunpeng instantly knew this was a fine treasure.

Luo Tian felt a dense water-elemental energy enveloping the space, his own water-elemental energy accompanied by an ominous aura.

The disciples of the Water Source Sect bore shocked expressions. This Qinglin Xianshui Armor was made from the Qingming Di Huang Snake given to Xu Yuangliang by Tu Yuanyuan.

The Qingming Di Huang Snake's massive body had only yielded two sets. Originally, Xu Yuangliang intended to give one to Tu Yuanyuan and the other to the winner of this competition. Now, seeing Tu Yuanyuan here made him angry, so he took out this Qinglin Xianshui Armor.

"Old Xu, what's special about this armor? Your reluctant look suggests it might be fake!" Lu Kunpeng scoffed.

"This Qinglin Xianshui Armor was forged with the scales of the Qingming Di Huang Snake and infused with my water-elemental energy. It combines the hardness of the Qingming Di Huang Snake's scales and the properties of water-elemental energy. Combined, it is both tough and flexible, capable of withstanding three attacks from a Bone-Devouring Peak-level opponent!" Xu Yuangliang spoke with pride.

Pang Haoran's face bore bitterness. He knew Xu Yuangliang had intended to give him an inner armor before entering the cave, which was this very one. Now, however, it would change hands.

Defensive items were rarer than offensive ones; Xuan-Grade defensive armor was even rarer. This item was priceless.

After Xu Yuangliang's explanation, Lu Kunpeng's eyes gleamed. He took the armor and tossed it to Luo Tian, clearly uninterested in it.

Luo Tian received the armor, feeling no weight at all. A gentle aura immediately enveloped him.

Pang Haoran and others bore envy. Even they didn't possess such a treasure. With this Qinglin Xianshui Armor, one would have the means to survive against a Bone-Devouring Peak-level opponent—what was that, after all?

Luo Tian held the armor, feeling the fiery gazes around him. To him, spending over one hundred million spirit stones for a mid-grade Xuan-Grade defensive item was already a great gain.

"Yes, good. Well, since you've offered something, let's call it even. I won't ask for the rest!" Lu Kunpeng waved generously.

Xu Yuangliang nearly exploded upon seeing Lu Kunpeng's demeanor. He snorted and waved his hand: "Go...!"

Lu Kunpeng knew when to stop, bowed to Xu Yuangliang and smiled: "Then I'll take my leave!"

"Go, Luo Tian. Hurry back; the sect has matters waiting for you!" Lu Kunpeng turned to Luo Tian.

"Grand Elder, please wait. I need to say a few words to my friends!" Luo Tian spoke softly to Lu Kunpeng, walking towards Cold Qiuchan and her group.

"Would you like a ride? Your sect didn't send anyone to meet you, did they?" Luo Tian's face showed concern as he addressed Cold Qiuchan and Feng Tianxiong.

"No need. My sect should arrive tomorrow. Luo Tian, if you go to the Southern Region, remember to find me at the Fumo Hall!" Feng Tianxiong replied. Not one for words, he smiled and extended an invitation.

"I suppose you didn't send anyone from your sect. Go on, I'll accompany you with the Grand Elder!" Luo Tian bowed to Feng Tianxiong and addressed Cold Qiuchan's group.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the three black-cloaked figures behind Cold Qiuchan bore expressions of joy. With Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng accompanying them, their journey back would be much safer. Once they left the Northern Region, they'd have no more worries.

"No need. If you ever have trouble, come find me in the Eastern Region!" Cold Qiuchan coldly refused, stating she was from the Eastern Region but not revealing her sect.

"Don't be stubborn. You can't escape a Bone-Devouring Mid-level opponent, so how about them? Don't you care at all?" Luo Tian knew Cold Qiuchan was cold-hearted but soft, so he persuaded her.

"Yes, Miss. If anything happens, our safety is minor, but if you were injured, that would be a major issue!" One of the black-cloaked youths spoke, also persuading her.

Cold Qiuchan gently caressed the small wolf in her arms. After thinking for a moment and seeing the pleading looks in her companions' eyes, she nodded slightly.

"Ah..." Seeing Cold Qiuchan nod, Luo Tian sighed in relief. He swallowed his words of persuasion and smiled.

"Respectful disciple, Cold Qiuchan, pays respects to the elder! I've troubled you!" Ignoring Luo Tian, Cold Qiuchan walked towards Lu Kunpeng and bowed.

Lu Kunpeng had been watching all along, knowing Luo Tian had taken him as a free bodyguard. He mentally cursed but didn't show it, for outside, he couldn't ruin his junior's face. Looking at Cold Qiuchan, she wasn't unlikable either. Lu Kunpeng spoke softly: "It's just a detour!"

Feeling the strong spiritual sense lifting her, Cold Qiuchan flashed a brief surprise. She hadn't expected Lu Kunpeng's spiritual sense to be so powerful.

Yet, having seen much, she said nothing more. She held the blue wolf and stood before Lu Kunpeng.

Luo Tian, seeing Cold Qiuchan transform into a different person, was speechless. This cold woman wasn't the same as before—she was clearly a well-mannered lady.

"Kid, what are you staring at? Come on, let's go!" Lu Kunpeng jolted Luo Tian out of his daze. He said goodbye to Xu Yuangliang, and the group left amidst the disciples of the Water Source Sect.

Seeing that seemingly frail figure, Tu Yuanyuan and others felt as if they'd been in a dream for three months—a nightmare they would never forget.

Yet, what puzzled them was the attitude of the deceased拓跋野宗门. Their sect's genius had been killed, yet there was no reaction. This made them curious about what forces lay behind Luo Tian.

Chapter 243: Returning Alone

Chapter 243: Returning Alone

Seeing Lu Kunpeng and others' distant figures, Xu Yuangliang bore a worried expression. He was old friends with Lu Kunpeng, though not very close. Otherwise, his personality would never have allowed him to so easily hand over one hundred million spirit stones and his carefully forged Xuan-Grade armor.

Gu Zhengye and others bore bitter expressions. Having looked down on the Northern Region before, they now understood there were always greater people and higher skies. They also secretly thanked Luo Tian's departure, as their debts would be delayed for a while. Yet, Luo Tian's name had become an insurmountable barrier in their minds.

Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng didn't know what the others were thinking, but they walked towards the Eastern Region.

The Eastern Region was so named because it lay at the far east of the Tianyuan Continent. Its most notable feature was its mystery, unlike other regions with numerous sects. However, those familiar knew the Eastern Region had sects too—though these were hidden and rarely seen. The more mysterious something was, the more it inspired awe.

The Northern Region to the Eastern Region wasn't short or long. At full speed of the Cultivation Body stage, it would take about a year.

Yet, there were shortcuts. Some great masters had set up teleportation arrays between regions to connect their spaces, allowing Cultivation Body and Bone-Devouring Stage disciples to quickly traverse regions. Naturally, the cost was exorbitant.

Though teleportation arrays existed, they weren't everywhere. Even those at the Spiritual Soul Stage could only repair them, not establish teleportation arrays.

Only legendary Boundary Lords, who mastered the mysteries of space, could construct such complex and mysterious structures.

However, since ten thousand years ago, no Boundary Lord had appeared on the Tianyuan Continent. Even Spiritual Soul and Ghost-Calling stages were rare, leaving few teleportation arrays in the current regions.

The Northern Region now had only three remaining teleportation arrays, located at its center—Feiyan City. Cold Qiuchan and her group had entered the Northern Region through there.

Feiyan City was in the heart of the Northern Region, so Luo Tian and others were now heading away from the Five Elements Sect. The journey was quiet; Cold Qiuchan wasn't talkative, and her three companions were also silent. Lu Kunpeng, as an elder, naturally didn't initiate conversation.

They stopped at a city gate, faces grim and minds furious.

Luo Tian had never felt such anger before. Before them was a city with no signs of life, bloodstained air filling their noses and making them uncomfortable.

"Son of a bitch!" Lu Kunpeng roared, punching the city wall and collapsing it to reveal the grim scene.

Bodies lay scattered everywhere. The group gasped, seeing a city full of corpses—old and young, even infants months old. Yet what puzzled them was the ground had only scattered bloodstains, as if drained completely.

"Did all these people vanish?" Luo Tian forced down his nausea and asked.

"They're not the first!" Lu Kunpeng's face was grim. He clearly feared the Tianshi Sect, otherwise he wouldn't have personally come to fetch Luo Tian back.

"Those people are cruel!" One of Cold Qiuchan's black-cloaked youths wiped his mouth, his expression twitching.

"Yes, the more people die, the stronger Tianshi Sect becomes. That's their technique's feature and all evil arts' trait. So, be careful when encountering Tianshi Sect members!" Lu Kunpeng explained.

Luo Tian nodded lightly. He thought of Li Xiuping, who might have been rescued by the Tianshi Sect and possibly joined it. His eyes flashed a hint of killing intent.

"Let's go!" Lu Kunpeng, his face darkened, told the group. He didn't want to stay longer.

Luo Tian and Cold Qiuchan's group naturally didn't want to linger. They all nodded, quickly leaving.

Throughout the journey, with few words already among them, the atmosphere grew heavier after passing through this city.

"Buzz..." A spiritual energy fluctuation sounded from Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian's waists. They took out their jade tablets, Wei Mingxuan's voice echoing in their minds.

"Grand Elder Lu, Luo Tian, hurry back. The Xiling Pool opens in seven days!"

Hearing Wei Mingxuan's voice, Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng's faces changed. They were at least five days away from the Five Elements Sect, and several more to Feiyan City. If they escorted Cold Qiuchan's group, they wouldn't be able to return for the Xiling Pool.

"What's wrong?" Cold Qiuchan, so perceptive, knew something had happened the moment their faces changed.

Lu Kunpeng's eyes carried a hint of apology as he explained the Xiling Pool matter. He thought they had already agreed to escort Cold Qiuchan's group, so it was impossible now.

"That's fine. We have a few days left; we should be okay!" Cold Qiuchan spoke softly to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's face bore contemplation. The Xiling Pool could increase the chance of entering the Bone-Devouring Stage. He hadn't cared before, but with the Tianshi Sect's bold appearance and their Bone-Devouring Stage leaders, his current strength was insufficient. He needed to quickly enter the Bone-Devouring Stage to face the Tianshi Sect, or else he'd have no choice but to stay in the Five Elements Sect.

Yet, he was concerned about Cold Qiuchan's safety. His eyes flashed a hint of fierceness: "Grand Elder, escort them away. I'll return to the Five Elements Sect myself!"

"What?"

"No!" Lu Kunpeng and Cold Qiuchan both spoke, their three black-cloaked youths also showing disbelief. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to disregard his safety, sending Lu Kunpeng to protect Cold Qiuchan while he faced danger alone.

They admitted Luo Tian was strong. Even against a Bone-Devouring Stage beginner, he could escape or even fight back. But seeing the city's condition, the Tianshi Sect's people were definitely not Bone-Devouring Stage beginners.

"Can't. Even if you don't let me enter the Xiling Pool, I can't let you take the risk alone!" Lu Kunpeng loudly refused.

Chapter 244: Bone-Devouring Mid-Level

Chapter 244: Bone-Devouring Mid-Level

"Grand Elder, my decision is final!" Luo Tian's eyes bore determination as he gazed at Lu Kunpeng.

Upon seeing Luo Tian's gaze, Lu Kunpeng felt a headache. The last time Luo Tian wanted to leave the Five Elements Sect, it was this gaze.

"Luo Tian, we'll go ourselves. Even if there's danger, we can handle it!" Cold Qiuchan felt warmed and spoke.

"Are you sure you're stronger than me?" Luo Tian smiled.

"No!" Cold Qiuchan honestly replied, admitting Luo Tian was indeed stronger than her.

"Then that's it. Since you're not as strong as me, don't be stubborn! You still owe me money!" Luo Tian stretched lazily.

"Go on, I'll send them off. I'll try to catch up with you. Be careful!" To Luo Tian's surprise, Lu Kunpeng didn't stop him but let him go.

Seeing Luo Tian's puzzled look, Lu Kunpeng wore a bitter smile: "You little bastard. Would you listen to me if I stopped you?"

"No!"

"Go to hell!" Lu Kunpeng kicked Luo Tian away, then turned to Cold Qiuchan: "Now we need to speed up!"

"Okay!" Seeing the two had decided, Cold Qiuchan nodded slightly and gave Luo Tian a careful look before saying nothing more.

Lu Kunpeng nodded lightly. The group's figures flickered, quickly heading toward Feiyan City.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng and others' distant figures, Luo Tian sighed, taking out a bag-like item. It was the one Cold Qiuchan had given him earlier, called the Nailing Spirit Bag.

The Nailing Spirit Bag's function was simple: it allowed凶兽 or pets to be stored inside, where they could survive. Luo Tian had placed Baihu inside it. With time pressing, Baihu's speed was much faster than his own, and Baihu was a Bone-Devouring Stage beginner beast, stronger than him.

"Roar..." Baihu let out a discontented roar upon emerging. It was reluctant to be put into the Nailing Spirit Bag, wanting to see outside.

"Okay, I'm letting you out. Now it's all on you!" Luo Tian smiled and patted Baihu's head.

After saying that, he leaped onto Baihu's back and whispered: "Go! When I reach the Five Elements Sect, I'll take you for a ride. For now, entering the Bone-Devouring Stage is most important!"

"Roar..." Baihu understood Luo Tian's words and roared, becoming a white lightning streak that vanished from the spot.

Luo Tian felt Baihu's speed and wore a relaxed expression. He secretly marveled at how much faster it was with Baihu. Luo Tian couldn't help but look forward to the day when Longbao emerged as a golden dragon, and he rode it—how impressive that would be.

But Luo Tian only thought about it. Longbao needed five hundred years to awaken, and if he didn't enter the Spiritual Soul Stage within that time, he might die.

Baihu became a white whirlwind, racing across the wide road. Luo Tian reclined on Baihu's back, eyes half-closed.

"Ha! I didn't expect to see a Bone-Devouring Stage beginner beast in this remote place. What luck! If I could obtain the beast's essence blood, my Soul-Refining Pearl would be small success. Then I could refine its corpse into a Tianshi and strengthen my power!"

"Hey, there's someone on top. Maybe it's better to subdue him as a steed! This beast is fast, and riding it would be quite good. Refining it into a Tianshi would bring too much death energy."

Two voices speaking made Luo Tian suddenly awaken. Though their voices were low, his spiritual sense had been on high alert and he heard their conversation.

"Soul-Refining Pearl, Tianshi Sect, Bone-Devouring Mid-Level. Run!" Luo Tian's face suddenly turned pale and shouted at Baihu.

Baihu, so perceptive, had already sensed something was wrong. By instinct as a beast, he felt danger and slowed down. Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Baihu's white fur bristled and he turned back toward where they came from.

"Hey... you're quite perceptive. Where do you think you can run?"

"It's interesting. A beast as a steed must be Bone-Devouring Mid-Level!" The two laughed, their bodies surrounded by blood-red spiritual energy as they chased Baihu.

But immediately after, they were surprised. The white tiger had suddenly turned back toward them.

"What did you two say?" A hoarse voice echoed, carrying the pressure of Bone-Devouring Peak, pressing down on the two.

"Bone-Devouring Peak!" One of the Tianshi Sect's elders looked terrified.

"I said my steed suddenly turned back, making me lose sleep. It was you two who were eyeing my steed! Baihu, you're really getting timid. Two Bone-Devouring Mid-Level opponents could make you turn back? You're becoming more and more cowardly!" As the two Tianshi Sect elders looked at Baihu, he finally approached them.

At this moment, Luo Tian had already put on his hat. He realized that with Baihu's and his speed, they couldn't escape two Bone-Devouring Mid-Level pursuers.

Muttering about bad luck, Luo Tian thought of his useless imitation advanced skill. He decided to try it out with Baihu.

But he had overestimated Baihu's courage. At this moment, Baihu's legs were trembling slightly.

In fact, Luo Tian's forehead was also covered in sweat, his heart pounding rapidly.

"Respectful elder, it's a misunderstanding!" One of the Tianshi Sect elders, upon sensing the powerful pressure, quickly put away his Soul-Refining Pearl and looked at Baihu's seemingly frail figure with respect.

The Tianshi Sect had been despised since ancient times, so the two were also anxious. They feared this Bone-Devouring Peak elder might discover something. Though both were Bone-Devouring Mid-Level, they still had a significant gap against Bone-Devouring Peak.

"Hmph! You said you wanted to eye my steed? Fight then!" Luo Tian spoke firmly. He knew only by being firm could they not suspect, otherwise if the two probed his spiritual sense or noticed any flaw, at such close proximity, both Baihu and he would be dead for sure!

"Respectful elder, this was our recklessness. Please don't blame us!" The two bowed and trembled, their heads lowered low.

Chapter 245: Escape

Chapter 245: Escape

"Yes, well... I won't hold it against you. Go!" Luo Tian's hoarse voice spoke. Baihu passed before the two, and at this moment, Luo Tian's heart was in his throat. His spiritual sense never relaxed, knowing that even a slight flaw would mean no chance of escape at such close range.

Under the two's fearful gaze, one tiger and one man slowly walked past them, heading toward the distance.

"Bad luck. It's a Bone-Devouring Peak!" One of the Tianshi Sect elders looked at Luo Tian's back, muttering.

But when he saw Luo Tian's back, his face showed confusion. He noticed Luo Tian's attire—blue robes, clearly not a middle-aged or old person's style. Yet Luo Tian's voice was hoarse.

He poked his companion, exchanging glances with him. Their spiritual senses probed out. They could clearly feel Baihu's trembling legs and Luo Tian's young aura.

"Why do I feel this Bone-Devouring Peak elder is so young?"

"Yes, but why is his voice so hoarse? Why is the tiger trembling?"

"Got us!" After their conversation, both faces showed anger. They realized the truth and turned to chase Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's spiritual sense had been on high alert, observing the two's behavior. When he sensed their actions, he knew he had exposed a flaw. He shouted at Baihu: "Run!"

Baihu, already tense, heard Luo Tian's words and didn't hesitate. His four legs ran wildly, becoming a white lightning streak that vanished from the spot.

"Little bastard! Daring to deceive me. When I catch you, I'll disintegrate your body!"

"I'll refine you into a Tianshi and make sure you don't reincarnate!" The two roared, becoming red streaks chasing Luo Tian.

Baihu was a Bone-Devouring Stage beginner beast with a beast's body, fast but still slightly slower than Bone-Devouring Mid-Level. The distance between them quickly closed.

"Ha! Kid, how do you plan to escape? Be sensible and stop. Otherwise, when we catch up with you, I'll show you!" Two middle-aged men laughed wildly.

Luo Tian sat on Baihu's back, his mind racing. His hands quickly changed into the Five Elements King's Seal, which flew out and hit the two.

Seeing Luo Tian's King's Seal, the two men were shocked. Not because of the seal's power but because they sensed Luo Tian's Cultivation Body stage energy and the attributes of his King's Seal.

"Five elements?"

"He's Luo Tian?" Both spoke simultaneously, their eyes showing joy.

"Haha! It's like sleeping and getting a pillow. We've gotten this big reward!" One man laughed.

"If we capture this kid, returning to the Tianshi Sect would be a major achievement. The resources gained would let us enter Bone-Devouring Peak! Haha!" The two laughed, knocking the King's Seal away with a punch. Their bodies didn't stop but instead sped up toward Baihu.

Baihu wished he had more legs. His white fur was soaked with sweat.

Luo Tian's face bore anxiety. His hood had been blown off by the speed, flying somewhere unknown. His slightly handsome face was revealed.

"Old Bai, I've dragged you into this!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, the words reaching his ears.

"Roar..." Baihu roared, increasing his speed significantly.

"Kid, don't resist. You can't escape!" The two men laughed again, increasing their speed and appearing before Luo Tian. Their eyes held greed, as if looking at boundless treasures.

Baihu suddenly stopped, his face showing a human-like seriousness.

"Kid, you almost tricked me! If I hadn't been smart, you would have escaped. Unfortunately!" One man looked at Luo Tian with disdain.

"Will you come with us willingly, or shall we do it ourselves?" The other man also looked at Luo Tian, his eyes full of mockery.

Luo Tian knew he couldn't escape now. He could only fight for his life. These two were much stronger than the魂祭 in the Locking Soul Tower. Even if one of them, with Baihu's help, could barely escape. If both were against him, he had no chance at all and could only try to fight.

But Luo Tian couldn't accept defeat. If he didn't fight, there was no chance at all. If he did fight, with his strength and numerous treasures, there was still a slim chance.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian jumped off Baihu's back. His spear, Lie Tian, appeared in his hand, emitting a continuous roar.

"Hey... this spear is nice. I want it!" One man instantly appeared before Luo Tian, his crimson spiritual energy fist smashing toward Luo Tian's chest.

Luo Tian felt the man rushing towards him through his spiritual sense, but his body couldn't match Bone-Devouring Mid-Level speed. He could only raise his fist in time.

"Boom!"

The single punch sent Luo Tian spitting blood and flying backward.

"Roar..." Baihu roared, running toward Luo Tian but was blocked by the other man.

"Beast, come with me and be my steed. This kid is about to die!" The man also punched Baihu, trying to subdue him.

"Roar..." Baihu knew he couldn't escape. His beastly ferocity showed, his sharp fangs exposed, biting toward the man.

For Baihu, Luo Tian wasn't too worried. Baihu was a Bone-Devouring Stage beginner with a beast's body, so he wasn't in immediate danger. Luo Tian was most worried about himself.

"Damn it! Bone-Devouring Mid-Level! How do I fight!" Luo Tian mentally roared, thinking about how to escape this Bone-Devouring Mid-Level opponent.

"Bone-Devouring Peak, pressure!"

Luo Tian roared, knowing he had to attack first. If he kept defending passively, he wouldn't get a chance to fight.

With the unique pressure of Bone-Devouring Peak, Luo Tian rushed toward the man. At the same time, his three-element spiritual energy surged wildly, transforming into light-elemental energy and emitting a dazzling glow.

"Five Elements Generation, King's Seal!" A flowing seal formed again. Luo Tian roared and unleashed the King's Seal, while Lie Tian returned to his hand.

"Five Elements Generation, Golden Snake Madness!" A deep roar echoed from Luo Tian's mouth. He knew this Bone-Devouring Mid-Level opponent was more than twice as strong as魂祭. He had to unleash all his attacks to possibly injure him.

Chapter 246: Leaving No Stone Unturned

Chapter 246: Leaving No Stone Unturned

Luo Tian unleashed all his attack techniques, his face showing madness. He stepped back.

The thunderous roar echoed continuously as several techniques hit the Bone-Devouring Mid-Level man rushing toward him.

Though the man was at Bone-Devouring Mid-Level, Luo Tian's full power could hold off a typical Bone-Devouring Beginner for some time. The man was confused by the consecutive techniques, though he knew they wouldn't kill him.

But the man realized that if hit, even he would be injured. He was secretly amazed by Luo Tian's fierce attack while his blood-red spiritual energy surged, arms glowing red—evidently using the unique bone-elemental power of Bone-Devouring Stage.
