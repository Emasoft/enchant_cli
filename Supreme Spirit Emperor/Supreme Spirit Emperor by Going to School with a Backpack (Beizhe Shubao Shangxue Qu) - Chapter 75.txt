After Leng Hongcai, Zheng Hongseng also cast a wary glance at Gu Qianxue before addressing Duan Chenfeng: "Old Duan, duels between juniors often result in injuries. What are you doing?"

"Injuries? It's not your son who was harmed! Let your son take a few punches instead! That was a century of vitality! Today, if Xingchen loses his legs or arms, I won't hold him accountable. Even if he suffers severe injuries, it's manageable. But how can one recover a century of vitality?" Duan Chenfeng's gaze carried coldness as he fixed Leng Hongcai with a piercing stare. To him, this Luo Tian was undeniably tied to the Yuling Sect.

Chapter 367: Dispersed

"Old Duan, let's think of a solution. With the strength of our three sects, recovering a century of vitality shouldn't be too difficult for us. Why are you holding onto this junior so tightly?" Leng Hongcai maintained a serene smile on his face.

"Leng Hongcai, I haven't even demanded an explanation from you yet, and you've come to comfort me? Everyone can see this boy is connected to your Yuling Sect. Don't treat my Tianjian Sect as a soft target!" Duan Chenfeng's anger flared the moment he saw Leng Hongcai.

"Conflict has begun!" Around them, dozens of sect masters secretly rejoiced. It was rare to witness disputes among the three major sects.

"If you're reassured, hand this child over to me. I promise to return him to you in good health. A century of vitality is no great challenge for my Yuling Sect!" Leng Hongcai's smile remained unwavering as he gazed at Duan Xingchen with admiration.

Hearing Leng Hongcai's words, the surrounding sect masters were stunned by Yuling Sect's power. A century of vitality could be restored so effortlessly.

Duan Xingchen's gaze flickered with coldness as he scanned Leng Hongcai's face before cautiously observing the three sword auras on Gu Qianxue. He nodded slightly: "Fine, I'll trust you once. If Xingchen's vitality isn't restored, my Tianjian Sect will hold you accountable!"

"Haha, enough. We've been old friends for years. Don't let this matter sour our relationship. A century of vitality is trivial. I'm sure Leng Xiong's expertise with wood-element techniques will make this easy!" Zheng Hongseng noticed the tension easing and addressed the two with a voice tinged with authority.

People's eyes widened as they gazed at Luo Tian, unable to fathom this outcome. The resolution of the matter required negotiation among the three sect masters.

Yet, people felt a profound sense of disappointment. Duan Xingchen's defeat meant the East Domain had lost to the North. This upset those from the East who looked down on Northern cultivators, leaving them uneasy.

"Since everything is settled, the joint recruitment can be declared over! Everyone may return now. If you wish to join a sect, you may attend their recruitment exams later—likely easier than this one. I declare this joint recruitment concluded!" Zheng Hongseng's voice carried a solemn authority, echoing into the crowd.

"Rustle..." The people marveled at the nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine-foot stone tablet and the battle between the two top youths of the North and East. Though the result was disappointing, they had been thoroughly entertained.

"Everyone, we may depart now. I'm sure you've found satisfactory disciples. Farewell!" Zheng Hongseng spoke, his face alight with a gentle smile as he bowed to the dozens of sect masters.

Hearing Zheng Hongseng's words, the dozens of masters responded with flattery. Zheng Hongseng and his companions reciprocated warmly, engaging in polite conversation.

After the pleasantries, only the three major sects and Shangguan Fei remained on the vast Wind雷 Platform.

"Alright, let's go. Brother Duan, I'll take this child for now!" Leng Hongcai smiled and patted his Naling Bag.

"Roar..." A dragon's figure materialized before the crowd.

Although Nascent Soul Realm cultivators could fly, Leng Hongcai had to carry both Leng Qiuchan and Duan Xingchen, making it inconvenient.

Luo Tian marveled at the prostrate dragon, his face etched with admiration as he silently sighed. The Naling Bag could even contain such a massive dragon.

"Naling Bag... Dragon... Oh no!" Luo Tian's lips twitched, then he suddenly recalled an event. He waved his hand and patted the Naling Bag again.

"Black...!" A childish voice echoed in their ears, and a golden figure vanished like lightning.

At the sight of this golden figure, the dragon instantly collapsed to the ground, its massive body trembling as it gazed at the golden light with a terrified expression.

"Crash..." The dragon baby, like an arrow released from a bow, lunged at the dragon before Duan Xingchen could speak, causing the dragon immense pain. Its massive eyes reflected a pitiful expression.

The three sect masters stared in astonishment at the dragon baby colliding with the dragon.

At that moment, the dragon baby rubbed its head, glancing around mischievously. Upon spotting Luo Tian's figure, it displayed a pouty face and rushed to his side, pounding his legs with tiny fists.

"Bad brother! You put me back in that dark place again!" The childish voice conveyed a sense of grievance, stirring compassion.

Luo Tian sighed, patting his head with a tender expression. He had been in a hurry earlier to hide the dragon baby from view, but now that he was exposed, there was no need to conceal it.

Zheng Hongseng and Duan Chenfeng's eyes flashed with sharpness upon seeing the dragon baby. Both were Nascent Soul Peak cultivators, just one step away from the Ghost-Soul Realm. They could easily sense the dragon baby's uniqueness.

"Alright, alright. It was unavoidable, right? Next time I'll take you out to play!" Luo Tian spoke as one would to a child, finally calming the dragon baby.

A humming sound resonated; it was time for the Nirvana Dragon Seal. The dragon baby pouted, reluctantly returning to the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

When the group saw the Nirvana Dragon Seal on Luo Tian's wrist, their faces bore interest. Especially Leng Hongcai, though Yuling Sect was known for sealing techniques, he had never seen such an intricate seal.

"This boy holds many secrets," Duan Xingchen mused inwardly, forcing a smile as he escorted the weakened Duan Xingchen to Leng Hongcai.

"Then I'll trouble you, Old Duan!" Duan Chenfeng spoke.

Duan Xingchen was indeed weakened but remained conscious. Though a century of vitality had damaged him greatly, he wasn't near death. From the start, Duan Xingchen's eyes had remained fixed on Luo Tian; losing to him was a bitter defeat. Especially when he saw Gu Qianxue's gaze toward Luo Tian, an indescribable anger surged within him.

"Old Duan, rest assured. I've never broken my word!" Leng Hongcai spoke with a confident smile.

"Then we'll take our leave first!" Leng Hongcai didn't wait for them to speak further but carried Duan Xingchen onto the dragon.

"Go!" Gu Qianxue approached Luo Tian, her gaze complex as she glanced at Gu Qianxue standing before him.

Chapter 368: Conditions

A chill enveloped Luo Tian's heart, sensing the coldness in Gu Qianxue's eyes. If not for Gu Lei's grip, he wouldn't have fared well.

"It's not what you think! Qiu Chan owes me a favor!" Luo Tian sighed, transmitting his thoughts to Gu Qianxue.

"Hmph! This sister is truly too many! Go away! I'm leaving! Just this once, if I see you with another woman again, you know the consequences!" Gu Qianxue's voice was icy, her face cloaked in frost.

"Take care! I'll return to strike at the Yelang Sect!" Luo Tian's eyes held a hint of reluctance, wanting to keep Gu Qianxue but unsure if Yuling Sect could unlock the seals on Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Gu Qianxue's body paused slightly, her lips curling upward as she faced away from Luo Tian.

Gu Lei smiled at Luo Tian: "Brother, you owe me a favor!"

"Shangguan Fei! Do you remember my words back then? If anything happens to them, the Yelang Sect will be wiped out!" Luo Tian's voice carried a killing intent as he gazed at Shangguan Fei.

Far away, Shangguan Fei trembled upon hearing Luo Tian's shout. Two years ago, if Luo Tian had spoken thus, Shangguan Fei would have felt hostility. Now, however, Luo Tian posed a threat to Yelang Sect. Based on his current strength, he was invincible in the Bone-Devouring Realm—unless one reached Bone-Devouring Peak, no one could match him.

Yet Shangguan Fei's heart twisted with a bitter laugh, thinking: "These two little masters are absolute ancestors in Yelang Sect. No one dares to touch them except for the elders. With those three sword auras alone, Nascent Soul Realm cultivators wouldn't dare act. Who could harm them?"

Though Shangguan Fei thought this, his face bore anger. As a senior of Yelang Sect's Southern Domain, he had to maintain his dignity. He coldly snorted: "Qianxue and Lei'er are key disciples under Yelang Sect. Don't worry about them!"

"Hope so," Luo Tian coldly snorted, leaping onto the dragon.

"Brother... we haven't finished talking yet! Uncle Leng, I'd like to visit Yuling Sect for a few days. Is that possible? I've hit it off with Luo Tian!" Zheng Xin, grinning, leapt onto the dragon's back, speaking incessantly.

Seeing his son would follow Leng Hongcai, Zheng Hongseng's face showed no anger but relief. He had truly feared his son; now, with Zheng Xin gone, he felt a rare peace.

At this moment, Zheng Xin became the center of attention, boasting on the dragon's back while patting Luo Tian's shoulder.

Even Leng Hongcai, despite his amiable nature, couldn't help but twitch slightly as he addressed Duan Chenfeng and Zheng Hongseng: "Then we'll depart first. After all, it's quite time-consuming to delay Xingchen's recovery!"

"Safe travels. Let's meet again if the opportunity arises!" Duan Chenfeng and Zheng Hongseng bowed to each other.

Leng Hongcai gently patted the dragon's back, emitting a series of strange sounds.

The massive dragon slowly flapped its十几丈-long wings, stirring gusts of wind as it ascended into the sky. Then, with a sudden burst of speed, it vanished from Zheng Hongseng and Duan Chenfeng's sight.

"Rumors say the Tianshi Sect went to the North Domain specifically for this boy. I wonder if his arrival in the East Domain is a blessing or a curse?" Zheng Hongseng gazed at the dragon disappearing into the sky, his face bearing a worried expression.

"It can't be. The teleportation arrays leading to various regions are under our three sects. Anyone entering the East Domain would inevitably pass through us. We'd know for sure! Besides, our East Domain's resources far surpass the North's. Even if Tianshi Sect wanted to infiltrate, it would be extremely difficult. Zheng Xiong, there's no need to worry!" Duan Chenfeng spoke with confidence.

"Hope so," Zheng Hongseng sighed, his green wings unfurling as he vanished from the spot.

"We should go too," Duan Chenfeng coldly snorted, glancing at Gu Qianxue before a massive dragon appeared before them, vanishing from sight.

As everyone left the Wind雷 Platform, it slowly descended into an ordinary platform.

Unbeknownst to them, in a dark space beneath the Wind雷 Platform, an old man smiled faintly, murmuring: "This boy deliberately let me hear his words. Well... old man, I'll investigate for you. Tianshi Sect? It's been a while since I last encountered them!"

The old man finished writing, then leisurely closed his eyes. The Wind雷 Platform fell silent once more, leaving only peace in its wake.

...

The dragon soared into the sky, and Luo Tian and his companions stood on its back. The wind howled past their ears.

"Rest a while. It'll take about a day to reach Yuling Sect," Leng Hongcai smiled gently, addressing Luo Tian.

"Ugh..." From the moment Zheng Xin arrived, Luo Tian had forcefully shoved a pill from Gu Lei into his mouth, rendering him speechless.

This thrilled Luo Tian; Zheng Xin's incessant talking was truly terrifying, leaving no one untouched.

"Respected elder, to be honest, my purpose in coming to Yuling Sect is to return to the North Domain. I wish to know what the North Domain is like now," Luo Tian's face bore sincerity; he couldn't deceive Leng Hongcai, who was Gu Qianxue's father.

"Ah... I understand. I can provide you with an update on the North Domain's current state. Of course, you may choose to leave, but you'll need another way to break the seal binding you," Leng Hongcai's eyes glimmered with a smile as he replied.

Luo Tian's ears caught Leng Hongcai's words, and his heart trembled. He knew the terrifying nature of the Nirvana Dragon Seal; even Gu Jian, a formidable cultivator, could only activate it for a minute. Yet Yuling Sect apparently had a solution.

"What's the condition?" Luo Tian's heart trembled, not because of the condition itself but because he hadn't expected Leng Hongcai to have a chance at solving his Nirvana Dragon Seal.

"Indeed, it's a condition!"

"What condition?" Luo Tian knew there was no free lunch; whatever he received, he'd have to pay.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's eager question, Leng Hongcai's lips curled slightly: "I want you to become Yuling Sect's Second Sect Master!"

"What?" Besides Leng Hongcai, everyone on the dragon's back wore expressions of disbelief, their eyes wide as they stared at Leng Hongcai, wondering what scheme he had in mind.

Only Gu Qianxue furrowed her brows slightly before her gaze turned cold, scanning the distance as she spoke: "Father, they're pressuring you again?"

"Never mind. Luo Tian, if you accept, this will benefit both you and me and Qianxue. But if you refuse, I'll return you to the North Domain!" Leng Hongcai's face bore anticipation as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian pondered, then continued: "I want to know why. There are surely many who wish to be Yuling Sect's Second Sect Master. What's the issue?"

"Long story..." Leng Hongcai, a Nascent Soul Peak cultivator, wore a bitter smile as he recounted the tale to Luo Tian.

Upon hearing Leng Hongcai's brief account, Luo Tian understood and wore a bitter smile, gazing at Gu Qianxue.

In truth, Leng Hongcai had no son, only his daughter Gu Qianxue. Yuling Sect's sect master was always a man; no woman had ever held the position. Thus, many eyed Gu Qianxue's position with desire. Though Gu Qianxue's talent and strength were among Yuling Sect's top, her gender was a hindrance. Many men sought her hand, hoping to marry her and gain the chance to become Yuling Sect's Second Sect Master.

Yet Gu Qianxue was obstinate; she had beaten away every suitor with a stick, leaving no one worthy of her. Leng Hongcai, though sect master, faced pressure from the elders. Upon leaving the sect, they had collectively issued an ultimatum: he must choose a successor from among the elders' descendants or they'd depose him.

After hearing Leng Hongcai's account, Luo Tian understood why he had publicly betrothed Gu Qianxue to himself.

Luo Tian's gaze flickered over Gu Qianxue's face, smiling slightly. No matter the reason, he had to help this time.

Standing nearby, Duan Xingchen gazed at Gu Qianxue with a dazed expression, feeling bitter.

"A mere Second Sect Master of Yuling Sect! What's the harm in becoming one?" Luo Tian smiled, speaking softly and accepting.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's acceptance, Leng Hongcai's face lit up with joy. He had another reason unspoken: his family's ancestral, the Cold Family's elder, had personally instructed him to befriend Luo Tian at all costs.

Otherwise, Leng Hongcai, Yuling Sect's master, would have found this matter棘手 but not insurmountable.

A day passed in the blink of an eye, and the dragon carried them to a mountain.

The air was rich with energy, resembling a fairyland. A faint glow surrounded the mountain, forming a barrier.

"Roar..." The dragon let out a low cry above the mountain peak.

"Aye, the Sect Master's dragon! The Sect Master has returned! Open the barrier quickly!" A disciple on the mountain spotted the dragon and hurriedly waved flags, showing respect.

"Buzz..." The energy fluctuation spread, and the barrier opened, revealing the mountain's true form.

"This is Yuling Mountain!" Leng Hongcai's eyes gleamed with pride as he introduced it to Luo Tian.

"Ah, I was stifled! Luo Tian, I tell you, Yuling Mountain is no small feat. I'm not a stranger here. Wait, I'll take you to meet someone—someone truly close to me..." Zheng Xin, now able to speak, incessantly chatted with Luo Tian.

"Roar..." The dragon circled the mountain peak before landing in a spacious courtyard.

Leng Hongcai didn't retrieve the dragon into his Naling Bag but ignored it, leading Luo Tian and others to a grand hall. No doubt, this was where Leng Hongcai resided.

"Alright, Qianxue, the situation is urgent. Take Luo Tian and Xingchen to Jiang Nanxuan; let him examine them. Also, ask if he can break Luo Tian's seal. I estimate no one else but Jiang Nanxuan could help!" Leng Hongcai immediately instructed Gu Qianxue to take Luo Tian and Duan Xingchen for treatment.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan's name, Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Zheng Xin had mentioned it twice before; Luo Tian thought Jiang Nanxuan was a young man, but now he realized he could heal Duan Xingchen. Duan Xingchen was someone even Leng Hongcai couldn't help, which quickly changed Luo Tian's image of Jiang Nanxuan into that of a reclusive master.

Before he could ponder further, Zheng Xin launched into an endless monologue about Jiang Nanxuan.

After about a quarter of an hour, under Zheng Xin's incessant chatter, Gu Qianxue led Luo Tian and the injured Duan Xingchen to a bamboo forest.

Luo Tian could see a serene courtyard in the distance.

Yet, he felt puzzled, gazing at the bamboo forest. For some reason, this seemingly ordinary bamboo forest gave him a strange sense of danger—a feeling that was inexplicable yet made him hesitant to step in.

"Come on, it's fine!" Gu Qianxue noticed Luo Tian's hesitation and smiled gently, stepping into the bamboo forest.

Zheng Xin clearly wasn't a stranger here, boldly following Gu Qianxue while supporting Duan Xingchen.

Luo Tian sighed, suppressing the lingering sense of danger and stepping into the bamboo forest.

Chapter 370: Jiang Nanxuan

In the depths of the bamboo forest, a serene courtyard lay before them. Everything seemed natural, yet Luo Tian felt an inexplicable rhythm growing more unsettling.

Following Gu Qianxue and Zheng Xin, he arrived at an ordinary courtyard.

The small courtyard was meticulously clean, with the faint sound of birdsong audible.

What surprised Luo Tian was a pair of young men seated at a stone table, playing chess on a board. They emitted no trace of spiritual energy, appearing as ordinary as anyone else. Yet beside them, a green python coiled beneath the chessboard, its eyes closed, evoking fear. A three-foot-long parrot-like bird perched on the edge of the board, occasionally preening its feathers. Its gem-like eyes displayed a human-like gaze before it returned to its task, ignoring the newcomers.

Seeing this, Luo Tian was even more astonished. Snakes and birds were natural enemies, yet they coexisted here. Even stranger was the pair of young men who showed no fear, their expressions calm as they played chess.

"Xuan Ge, you've lost again! You let me win!" A woman in a blue robe spoke, her beauty slightly inferior to Gu Qianxue but possessing an ethereal aura.

"You didn't have guests, did you?" A man in white robes stood before her, his black hair flowing. A tranquil aura radiated from him.

"I'll go get tea. Chat with you later!" The woman nodded to Gu Qianxue and walked into the bamboo house.

"Qianxue, you're a rare guest! Stay and chat with me later!" The woman smiled at Gu Qianxue before disappearing.

"Nanxuan Brother, it's been a long time! I've missed you dearly these past two years. You don't know how much..." Zheng Xin, without waiting for Gu Qianxue to speak, rushed to the white-robed man and began his endless chatter.

The man calmly watched Zheng Xin's monologue, smiling slightly without stopping him or avoiding him. Instead, he listened patiently.

Luo Tian's eyes widened upon hearing Zheng Xin utter Jiang Nanxuan's name. He had previously considered Jiang Nanxuan an enigmatic master, but now he realized it was this white-robed man. This contradicted his expectations.

"Surely, this white-robed man has no cultivation at all. How can he help me break the Nirvana Dragon Seal?" Doubt surged in Luo Tian's heart.

"Nanxuan Brother, can you restore Duan Xingchen's vitality?" Gu Qianxue spoke with an unusually gentle tone, lacking her usual coldness.

Hearing Gu Qianxue's words, Zheng Xin, who had been chattering endlessly, suddenly became discreet, knowing the urgency of treating Duan Xingchen.

Zheng Xin supported Duan Xingchen to a seat.

Throughout the journey, Duan Xingchen hadn't spoken, his gaze unfocused. Luo Tian's defeat had deeply wounded him.

"Xingchen Brother, it's been a while! I never expected to see you like this!" Jiang Nanxuan's eyes showed a rare touch of emotion as he gazed at Duan Xingchen.

"Thank you, Nanxuan Brother!" Duan Xingchen's voice was hoarse, his face bearing a bitter smile.

Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brows and gently probed Duan Xingchen's wrist and throat, then smiled: "Good. The one who attacked you has just mastered the essence of wood-element techniques, so it was only a loss of a century's vitality. If they had fully mastered it, that would have been truly problematic!"

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words, Luo Tian and the others were stunned. Especially Luo Tian, who hadn't expected this young man of similar age to restore vitality lost.

"Haha! I said Nanxuan Brother isn't ordinary. Just by being friends with me, you're definitely not ordinary..." Zheng Xin, hearing Jiang Nanxuan could heal Duan Xingchen, displayed admiration and returned to his chatty self.

"Xingchen Brother, you should know better than to fight constantly! After recovery, be sure to change your ways. Then I'll talk with you for three days and nights..." Zheng Xin, without waiting for anyone to speak, began comforting Duan Xingchen.

Duan Xingchen, already weak, felt his head spin from Zheng Xin's endless chatter. He spat blood, his head throbbing as he glared at Zheng Xin with hatred. If not for his weakened state, Duan Xingchen would have drawn his sword and cut out Zheng Xin's tongue.

"Who is this?" Ignoring Zheng Xin, who had made Duan Xingchen vomit blood, Jiang Nanxuan turned his gaze to Luo Tian.

"This is Luo Tian from the North Domain's Five Elements Sect!" Gu Qianxue quickly introduced, her face showing concern.

Zheng Xin's ears twitched at Gu Qianxue's introduction, and he instantly appeared before Luo Tian, laughing: "Nanxuan Brother, I told you I had no one like me before. But after meeting Luo Tian, I realized my mistake. He's definitely my second confidant! We hit it off instantly..."

Luo Tian's lips twitched as he bowed to Jiang Nanxuan: "I am Luo Tian!"

"Nanxuan Brother, I brought him here to ask if you could help break the strange seal that's trapping him. Do you know how?" Gu Qianxue directly stated their purpose.

"Since Qianxue Sister said it, I can't refuse!" Jiang Nanxuan's eyes showed understanding as he glanced at Gu Qianxue, causing her face beneath the black veil to redden.

"You're bullying Qianxue Sister again!" The woman's voice echoed as she emerged from the bamboo house, carrying tea.

"Meng Sister!" Gu Qianxue saw her and felt like a savior, instantly losing her icy demeanor. She rushed to the woman's side like a butterfly.

"If I'm not mistaken, this seal on your back is the legendary Dragon's Nirvana Seal, right?" Jiang Nanxuan's calm voice reached Luo Tian, causing his face to pale.

Wishing everyone a happy new year with four chapters.

Chapter 371: Possibility

Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words, Luo Tian was stunned. He hadn't expected Jiang Nanxuan to recognize the Nirvana Dragon Seal on his wrist. His gaze toward Jiang Nanxuan changed, gradually becoming respectful.

The Nirvana Seal—this unique seal of the Dragon Clan was unknown even to the Five Elements Sect's five Ghost-Soul Realm masters. Yet this young man in his twenties recognized it, proving he was no ordinary person.

"Does Jiang Brother have a way to break it?" Luo Tian's face bore hope as he asked.

Hearing Luo Tian's question, Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brows and fell into deep thought.

Meanwhile, Meng Yao, who had been chatting with Gu Qianxue, noticed Jiang Nanxuan's furrowed brows and was surprised. In her memory, Jiang Nanxuan had never frowned before, even in the face of great calamities.

"Xuan Ge? This seal is difficult to break?" Meng Yao asked softly.

As Meng Yao's question echoed, everyone's gaze turned toward Jiang Nanxuan, including Luo Tian's, who clung to a sliver of hope.

Jiang Nanxuan seemed not to hear Meng Yao's question, picking up a chess piece the parrot had taken and playing chess on the board.

Gu Qianxue's eyes showed anxiety, but Meng Yao stopped her from speaking and shook her head.

"No!" Jiang Nanxuan's brows furrowed, his hands alternating between white and black pieces.

Luo Tian gazed at the board, confusion on his face. He was born a commoner, even less than one, and didn't know the rules of chess.

Yet every time Jiang Nanxuan placed a piece, his eyes blurred, as if returning to the stone tablet and witnessing bloody battles. He felt like he had returned to his fight against the Tianshi Sect, seeing endless mountains of corpses.

"Wrong!"

"No!" Jiang Nanxuan muttered repeatedly. Soon, sweat beaded on his forehead.

After a quarter of an hour, Jiang Nanxuan exhaled softly and ignored the board. He approached Luo Tian, lifting his hand with the Nirvana Seal for a close inspection.

Everyone except Duan Xingchen watched Jiang Nanxuan with tension, even Zheng Xin remained silent.

Another quarter of an hour passed. Meng Yao wiped Jiang Nanxuan's forehead with a handkerchief, the first time she had seen him in such a state.

"Alright, Meng Yao, I'll do it myself!" Jiang Nanxuan took the handkerchief and wiped his forehead.

"How is it, Nanxuan Brother? Can you break it?" Gu Qianxue's face showed urgency as she asked.

"I can only try my best. There's a fifty percent chance. If I'm not mistaken, your Nirvana Seal contains an extraordinary dragon. Thus, it's quite difficult. Also, the time is long. I need to prepare some things. Unfortunately, if there was a dragon's reverse scale, the chance would be greater!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke with a sigh.

"Really?" Luo Tian's face lit up, surprised that Jiang Nanxuan had a way to break the Nirvana Seal. If so, this trip to the East Domain hadn't been in vain.

"What did you say? Dragon's reverse scale?" Luo Tian's face showed joy as he asked.

"Yes, it's a dragon's reverse scale—something every dragon has once in their life. Unfortunately, dragons regard it as a treasure and no dragon would part with it. Even Yuling Sect's dragon wouldn't let us use its reverse scale!" Jiang Nanxuan explained.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan's explanation, the others' faces showed disappointment.

"Look at this!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with joy, holding up the golden Dragon Emperor's reverse scale and presenting it to Jiang Nanxuan.

Upon seeing the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale, Jiang Nanxuan's calm expression changed again. He carefully examined it before asking something, then gazed deeply at Luo Tian.

"It's possible. With this, my chance increases by ten percent. The rest depends on your fortune!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled.

"Then I'll trouble you, Brother Jiang!" Luo Tian's eyes showed deep respect, bowing to Jiang Nanxuan. This was the first time he had admired someone of his age so profoundly.

"Haha... Brother Luo, I'll tell you, if Nanxuan Brother said there was a fifty percent chance, it's actually seven. If there were six, it would be eight. I'll tell you, Nanxuan Brother's expertise in seals and formations is unmatched except for the few old men who never leave Yuling Sect. Even Sect Master Leng Hongcai admits he's inferior! So, you've found the right person..." Zheng Xin, hearing their conversation concluded, finally spoke up, continuing his endless chatter.

"Let's first resolve Xingchen Brother's issue before worrying about Brother Luo's!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled and spoke.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan would first restore his vitality, Duan Xingchen's face lit up. He wanted to bow to Jiang Nanxuan but saw Zheng Xin approaching him, ready to speak.

"Bring Xingchen Brother into the bamboo forest!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, then walked to a spacious area within the bamboo forest.

Luo Tian and Zheng Xin carried Duan Xingchen to Jiang Nanxuan's side but found him drawing a circle on the ground with a bamboo stick and having Meng Yao retrieve a cushion from her storage ring to place inside it.

"Xingchen Brother, forgive me for this inconvenience! You'll have to stay here for a few days!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled, gesturing Zheng Xin to place Duan Xingchen on the cushion.
