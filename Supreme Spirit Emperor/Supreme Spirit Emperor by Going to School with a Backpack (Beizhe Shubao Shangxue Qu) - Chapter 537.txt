However, soon after, Luo Tian, Xue Mian, and Tianshu took a sharp breath, their eyes flashing with disbelief.

In the line of sight, a figure stood there, his face equally filled with surprise, though it vanished in an instant, returning to normal. This man was Yang Huanyu.

Before Yang Huanyu stood a black-clad figure lying on the ground, blood gushing from his forehead, his body convulsing violently, spitting out copious amounts of blood. His gaze carried a sense of bewilderment.

"This..." Upon witnessing this scene, Tianshu was momentarily stunned, while Luo Tian stood frozen in awe. Xue Mian remained standing, pondering for a moment.

"This is too unlucky..." A collective thought arose among them—this man's luck was truly abysmal.

The only possibility of suddenly appearing in this hall was having fully mastered the one hundred and eight hand seals.

Clearly, this man's sudden appearance was misplaced—right before Yang Huanyu, nearly slain by Tianshu's axe.

"I... I..." The middle-aged man stammered, unable to speak, his mouth continuously spewing blood.

"God, why am I so unlucky!" The middle-aged man shouted, trembling as he rose to his feet, radiating an overwhelming aura.

The middle-aged man could sense that if not for something blocking the axe, he would have been split in two. Even so, this single strike had left him severely wounded, his forehead's gash clearly visible, radiating a chilling wind.

"Y-You..." As the middle-aged man prepared to curse, he saw Tianshu and Xue Mian standing there, immediately clamping his mouth shut.

"Buzz..." As the three in the hall remained stunned, a tremor emanated from within the hall. Two black figures materialized out of thin air, filling the chamber with a chilling aura.

"Xue Mian, Tianshu!" The two black-clad figures exclaimed in unison, their voices laced with solemnity.

They appeared almost simultaneously before Luo Tian and the others, their gazes sweeping over Xue Mian and Tianshu.

"It seems you won't have the chance to refine it after all," Yang Huanyu remarked, a hint of amusement in his eyes.

Both were clad in black, their appearances resembling middle-aged men, exuding a sharp aura and the eerie chill of Hellish Recluses.

More alarming to Xue Mian and Tianshu was that both were at the peak of True Immortality, while the unfortunate man who had nearly been split by Tianshu's axe was also at True Immortality Late Stage.

"Guiya!"
"Tian Meng?" The two Hellish Recluses were instantly recognized by Tianshu, who called out their names.

"Master Guiya!" The middle-aged man with a wound on his head immediately rejoiced, as if finding support, stepping behind the two.

"Haha, Xue Mian, Tianshu, you two shall perish swiftly!" The middle-aged man shouted furiously, his voice filled with satisfaction.

Four True Immortality Peak warriors exchanged glances, none daring to strike first, their gazes filled with caution—evidently, they were all acquainted.

Within the region of Btian City, there was a Death List; likewise, Btian City maintained a Death List for Hell. Guiya and Tian Meng were among those on the list.

Yet, over these years of warfare, Xue Mian and Tianshu had clashed with Guiya and Tian Meng before. Neither side could overcome the other, both being peak warriors—killing one another required a desperate clash.

"Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul!" A rasping voice emerged from Guiya's mouth, sending a chill down Luo Tian's spine.

His icy gaze locked onto Luo Tian's Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul, and Guiya extended a withered hand toward Luo Tian.

"Did you two take all the treasures in this hall?" Tian Meng bellowed, his eyes scanning the hall. Seeing that the shelves had remained undamaged despite their battle, he immediately deduced the answer.

"Yes, so what? If you want it, come and take it!" Tianshu brandished his azure axe, his gaze brimming with battle-readiness.

Luo Tian roared, the ghostly claw tearing through space and appearing beside Luo Tian. Luo Tian struck with a palm.

"Poof..." The withered ghostly claw pierced Luo Tian's hand, slicing through like tofu, reaching for the soul vial in Luo Tian's grasp.

Two overlapping punches clashed; Luo Tian struck with a fist, colliding with the ghostly claw. The withered claw finally shattered under Luo Tian's punch, dispersing into True Immortal energy.

Luo Tian's body collided again with the hall's wall, his face pale as he gazed at Guiya, who wore an expression of surprise.

"Even after my strike, you still live—impressive. Hand over the Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul, and I shall spare your life," Guiya rasped again, his voice like a raven's cry.

"Want the Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul? Dream on!" Luo Tian's face was pale, he pulled out a handful of pills and swallowed them, his eyes flashing with madness.

"Die!" Guiya's face darkened; two sharp glares erupted from his lifeless eyes, transforming into two arrows that shot toward Luo Tian.

"Clang... Clang..." As the light arrows neared Luo Tian, the azure axe blocked them, repelling the attack.

"Guiya, do you think you can kill my Btian City people so easily?" Tianshu smiled, grabbing Luo Tian and pulling him behind.

"If that's the case, then we must eliminate both of you—three names on the Hellish Death List. Killing them would surely earn us great rewards!" Tian Meng laughed, waving his hand. A series of tiger roars echoed from his palm, and a black axe materialized in his grasp.

This axe bore the image of a fierce tiger's head, its handle engraved with black tiger-like patterns.

"Gui Fu Tian Meng! I've heard of you before. Today, I shall test your skills!" Tianshu's eyes blazed with battle-readiness as he faced Tian Meng.

"You two just fought among yourselves and are exhausted—what qualifications do you have to fight us?" Guiya raised his head, revealing a grotesque face before Luo Tian's eyes.

His entire face was marred with black swellings, his facial features distorted. His eye sockets were empty and hollow, yet within them, two black threads of energy drifted.

"Who do you think you are to kill me?" Xue Mian scoffed, drawing his ice sword. Mist rose as his aura surged.

Four warriors stood motionless, none daring to strike first—yet the killing intent brewed among them. Even Luo Tian felt unable to approach their vicinity.

"This is when they truly unleash their power," Luo Tian mused, standing in the hall's corner, observing the four.

"Beauty or not is not for you to decide!" Luo Tian's heart tightened as a thunder-patterned fist suddenly appeared at his back.

In an instant, Luo Tian's body lurched forward; the speed of the thunder fist was too fast. Even with his quick reflexes, he hadn't anticipated Thunder's sudden attack. His body instinctively moved, barely evading the strike.

Had it been anyone else, they would have been struck directly by Thunder's fist—just one punch could have left them severely wounded, or even killed.

"Good kid!" Thunder's eyes gleamed with admiration as he gazed at Luo Tian, but he leapt into the air without giving Luo Tian a chance to retaliate. His body became a streak of lightning, reappearing beside Luo Tian again.

"Get lost..." Luo Tian sneered, inwardly lamenting Thunder's strength. If he hadn't joined the Eighth Army, defeating Thunder would have relied solely on his secret techniques—Yeshi Bow and Lie Tian Spear.

But now, Luo Tian had made remarkable progress; he was but a step away from True Immortality. Moreover, the military camp prohibited using martial arts—this gave Luo Tian a chance to defeat Thunder.

Thunder's strength exceeded Luo Tian's expectations; he wasn't certain if he could overcome Thunder, but it was not impossible.

Luo Tian had been under immense pressure recently; he needed an outlet. Since he couldn't confront Xue Mian or Jiang Chen, he chose Thunder—Xue Mian's younger brother.

"I'll beat your friend, so I'll beat you!" Luo Tian thought this way. Though Thunder was formidable, Luo Tian's body had surpassed True Immortality Early Stage. With a few techniques added, he still held some confidence.

Yet Thunder struck first, overpowering Luo Tian immediately—Thunder's speed was too fast, and he had the advantage of surprise.

Pound after pound...

However, Luo Tian was no pushover. After the first hit, he deflected all subsequent attacks. Though he looked awkward, he suffered no major harm.

"Kid, you're good!" Thunder laughed loudly, his second lightning strike erupted from his arm, displaying two-colored thunder patterns.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous roar echoed, and with the addition of two lightning patterns, Thunder's aura surged again. His robes fluttered violently as a forceful explosion radiated from his body.

Luo Tian's brows twitched slightly; he exhaled, sending out an invisible wave from his mouth, which manifested as a divine force upon his body.

The collision sound returned; with the Divine God Battle Song加持, Luo Tian's aura soared, matching Thunder's. The two clashed again and again, each collision sending tremors through the sky and shaking space.

"One is a half-step True Immortality with a powerful body, the other is True Immortality Mid-Stage, an elite among thousand-man captains. Behind him stands the Thousand-Man Captain Xue Mian!" People murmured lowly, watching the two clash.

"But Luo Tian still can't match him," people whispered, "Though his secret technique strengthens his body, I heard Thunder has five lightning patterns. That's his peak strength. Now only two are active—how can Luo Tian withstand the fifth?" People watched the two clash, their gazes filled with concern.

Evenly matched—this was the state of the two at this moment, each step back after every clash.

"Kid, if that's your full strength, you should surrender!" Thunder bellowed, his voice laced with dissatisfaction.

"Buzz..." The third lightning pattern surged upward, a thunder dragon coiling around Thunder's arm.

With the third pattern activated, Thunder's aura surged again, a powerful pressure spreading across heaven and earth.

Fourth... Following closely, thunder roared as Thunder's upper body clothes exploded, revealing his toned torso.

"Terrifying!" Luo Tian gazed at Thunder's body covered in lightning, his eyes filled with admiration. This thunder's body truly made Luo Tian feel a strong sense of crisis.

"Damn it, he's overdoing it..." Luo Tian inwardly sighed; Thunder's body was indeed the strongest he had ever seen among True Immortality Mid-Stage warriors. It was truly rare, capable of rivaling even True Immortality Late Stage.

"Kid, now I see what you have to offer!" Thunder laughed loudly, his voice echoing through the heavens. He struck downward with a fist.

"Boom..." Luo Tian raised his hand, striking toward the fist. A crisp sound echoed.

The strike landed; the ground beneath Luo Tian cracked, spreading outward. Luo Tian's hands pressed against the sky, his body trembling violently, sweat pouring from his forehead.

"Damn it! You chose me instead of the third brother—treating me like a soft target!" Thunder's inner voice was不满, striking again.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, watching Thunder's massive fist. His lips twitched; this time he didn't fight directly but bent his body, vanishing from the spot—using the King's Battle Technique.

"Although my body isn't as strong as yours, I have more combat experience!" Luo Tian smirked inwardly, instantly appearing dozens of feet away. His face bore contempt as he gazed at Thunder.

"This kid still has such techniques in the Immortal Realm!" Thunder's eyebrows furrowed slightly beneath his mask, his body transforming into lightning.

"Boom..." A dull sound rose before Luo Tian's face; Luo Tian's pale face was filled with disbelief.

He had just activated the King's Battle Technique again, hoping to evade Thunder's attack. But he hadn't anticipated that those four-colored lightning beams had found his path, blocking him.

"Luo Tian is done for!" People gasped, watching the battered Luo Tian lying on the ground. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

The speed of Luo Tian and Thunder was too fast; even they hadn't kept up with it. By the time people reacted, they saw Luo Tian lying there.

"Ultimately, he was too weak," people marveled, not believing Luo Tian would lose but surprised at how brutally he had been defeated.

"How is this possible!" Luo Tian murmured, the King's Battle Technique had always been foolproof. He hadn't encountered anyone who could crack it.

To crack it, one would need to know him intimately—exceptionally familiar with his thoughts and habits.

Ruin followed; for the next period, Luo Tian was completely crushed by Thunder, leaving everyone in awe.

"I've never seen the Big Brother so suppressed!" Ye Liangchen's eyes widened in disbelief, watching Thunder relentlessly strike Luo Tian.

"So fierce! Thunder, the Thousand-Man Captain, truly lives up to his title—able to suppress Luo Tian so thoroughly!" People were also in awe, watching Luo Tian being pushed back repeatedly. Each of Thunder's punches made Luo Tian's face pale or added another crack to his body.

"Divine Form!"

"World!" Luo Tian didn't give up, immediately standing up. His hands formed a seal, his body growing in size.

"If that's not enough, I'll have to accept defeat!" Luo Tian felt a bit reckless; Thunder's body was too strong, exceeding his expectations. Even the King's Battle Technique had been cracked.

A massive body appeared in people's sight, taking a step forward and striking downward with a fist toward Thunder.

The sky darkened; the strongest punch, double the body's strength—this was Luo Tian's last hope. If this failed to injure Thunder, he would have no choice but to give up.

"Kid, you're too harsh!" Thunder gazed at the mountain-like fist approaching him and suddenly unleashed his fifth lightning pattern. At the same time, five-colored divine thunder descended from the sky, turning a ten-thousand-foot radius into a five-colored lightning sea.

"Rippling... Rippling..." The lightning sea surged, Thunder roared to the sky. A series of thunderbolts gathered around him, forming a hundred-foot-tall lightning figure before Luo Tian.

One roar shook the heavens; the lightning figure transformed into Thunder's form, wearing a fierce mask. It struck with a fist as well.

The heavens trembled and shook, the entire military camp seemed to pause. Two towering figures collided, then in people's sight, both figures collapsed, dust and storms swirling, divine energy chaotic. Cracks appeared in the void, making it impossible to see Luo Tian and Thunder's bodies.

After thirty breaths, the world returned to calm; cracks healed. People's eyes were filled with anticipation as they watched the gradually calming battlefield of Luo Tian and Thunder.

"I have lost..." A deep voice echoed, causing people's faces to change instantly.

"Is that...?"
"It's Thunder!" They soon recognized Thunder's unique voice, their faces filled with disbelief.

"How is this possible?" People gasped again; they hadn't believed Thunder would lose to Luo Tian.

The dust finally cleared, two figures stood there. Luo Tian's face was pale, his breath ragged as he gazed at Thunder, but his eyes held confusion.

Thunder, compared to Luo Tian, was far more battered; his right arm hung lifelessly, his entire body trembling. His strong upper body was also covered in wounds.

"From now on, you are the Thousand-Man Captain; this Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul belongs to you!" Thunder waved his hand, seemingly very reluctant, and sent the complete Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul to Luo Tian's front.

"Respectfully yielded!" Luo Tian felt some confusion; during their clash, he had unleashed his strongest strike. Thunder also seemed to have given it all.

Yet Luo Tian felt a sense that Thunder still had more strength left, and his current state wasn't as it seemed. This all appeared to be intentional—aimed at transferring the Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul into his hands.

Chapter 2059: The Extreme Stage of True Immortality

In the hall, Luo Tian stood there, surrounded by thick divine energy. Three golden figures fiercely devoured scattered divine artifacts.

"Roar..." A roar echoed, and the thick ghostly qi in the hall continuously gathered toward Luo Tian.

"How can he absorb ghostly qi!" Chen Xiao was stunned, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Not only that, but Luo Tian's entire body had instantly opened one hundred and eight major acupoints. Black whirlwinds spun across his entire body.

Time slowly passed; the three figures continuously absorbed divine and ghostly qi, twin whirlwinds appearing above Luo Tian's head.

"Stop him!" Chen Xiao shouted, his body radiating a tremendous aura. A black tiger emerged from his hand, expanding violently into reality, rushing toward the surging divine energy.

At the same time, Chen Xiao's body emitted waves of black patterns. Upon the appearance of these black symbols, the battered Chen Xiao instantly recovered much strength, even his head's crack began to heal.

"Buzz..." As Chen Xiao continuously fought back, a transmission tremor returned. A black figure appeared in the hall.

Upon entering the hall, a lightning bolt struck down. Cold eyes gazed at the lightning approaching him; he extended his hand to grasp it.

"Another Hellish Recluse?" Luo Tian shivered, but upon seeing the black figure, he sighed deeply.

"Black Night!" Thunder's face showed a hint of joy as he shouted to the black figure.

Black Night leapt into the air, landing beside Thunder: "What's going on?"

"I don't know either..." Thunder briefly recounted what he knew, his gaze turning to Luo Tian standing there.

"That Recluse?" Black Night then saw Chen Xiao, who was constantly fighting and nearly reaching Luo Tian.

"That bastard! I just entered and he immediately attacked me!" Thunder shouted, as if recalling his own experience.

"Brother, let's go kill someone together!" Thunder shouted, leaping into the air. Five-colored divine thunder surrounded his body, forming a lightning blade that instantly appeared beside Chen Xiao.

A black dagger appeared behind Chen Xiao, aiming for his throat. Chen Xiao's face changed.

"Get out of the way!" Chen Xiao roared, his body shaking. He swung a black long sword toward Thunder's lightning blade while grabbing Black Night's dagger with his hand.

Though Chen Xiao blocked Thunder and Black Night's attacks, he was still struck by a martial technique.

"Kill..." Thunder and Black Night stopped their bodies, then leapt into the air again, rushing toward Chen Xiao.

"Damn it! Daring to attack me, my brother has arrived; I'll kill you!" Thunder continuously cursed, beginning to fight Chen Xiao alongside Black Night.

Thunder and Black Night were both at True Immortality Mid-Stage, but having worked together for years, they didn't fall behind against a severely wounded Chen Xiao.

"I'm not doing this on purpose! I just entered and was attacked; I almost got split in two!" Chen Xiao inwardly cursed, his eyes filled with anger. Though Thunder dared to bother him, he didn't dare to provoke Tianshu.

The thunderous sounds continued, the hall became chaotic; only Luo Tian stood there, observing the battle.

Thunder and Black Night's arrival allowed Luo Tian to fully focus on his push toward True Immortality. If Luo Tian reached True Immortality Early Stage, it might change the battle's outcome.

Time passed slowly; the talismans Luo Tian had thrown were gradually exhausted, leaving only three battles in the hall, constantly clashing.

Two great axes collided repeatedly, space trembling as Tianshu and Tian Meng continuously swung their axes with violence.

Flashes of cold light appeared, a cold long sword clashing against withered hands, producing an ear-piercing sound and divine laws.

"Buzz..." After an hour of absorption and refinement, the three figures in Luo Tian's dantian finally solidified into reality. They sat within his dantian, one black, one golden, and one gray.

"Merge!" Luo Tian roared, the three-colored figures instantly collided with each other. Cracking sounds echoed repeatedly; Luo Tian's dantian seemed to explode, even the hall produced阵阵 thunderous sounds, though the battle's fluctuations were too strong to be noticed.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sounds continued, and intense pain spread throughout Luo Tian's body, as if his soul was being torn apart.

Divine energy surged; within this divine energy, a phantom figure sat and gradually solidified. The pain continued to torment Luo Tian, but his eyes showed intense joy. Once this phantom figure solidified completely, Luo Tian would become an Extreme Stage True Immortal.

"Damn it, he's about to enter the Extreme Stage!" Chen Xiao and others felt Luo Tian's overwhelming change in aura.

"Fade into the masses!" Chen Xiao finally couldn't hold on; he clearly remembered that Tian Meng and Guiya had said if Luo Tian became an Extreme Stage True Immortal, he would die!

A black long sword was thrown upward above Chen Xiao's head. It emitted ten thousand feet of divine light, and a series of black lights flew out, forming countless black long swords that slashed toward Thunder and Black Night.

Thunder and Black Night were forced back, their attacks shattered before them, pushing them beyond Chen Xiao's attack range.

"Kill..." Chen Xiao roared, his eyes wild with madness. He had spent so much energy; his goal was to deliver a fatal blow to Luo Tian.

"Damn it!" Thunder cursed, his body emitting thunderous sounds. He instantly appeared beside Luo Tian.

"Die!" Chen Xiao shouted, raising his sword. His body's ghostly qi surged into the long sword.

He swung the sword, and Chen Xiao's body became hollowed out. This strike was his full strength with no reserves; he even drew out some vitality, making this strike reach his peak.

The void shattered, the sword's energy spread everywhere. This strike even made Xue Mian and others feel a hint of danger.

At the same time, Luo Tian, who was pushing toward True Immortality, felt a life-threatening crisis. He opened his eyes.

But then he saw a strong figure standing before him, five-colored lightning blades raised high, meeting the overwhelming strike.

"Don't!" Luo Tian roared; Xue Mian's eyes immediately showed anxiety. Black Night's body instantly transformed into a black line, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Crack..." Thunderous lightning echoed in the hall, five-colored lightning blades shattered before everyone's eyes. The black long sword sliced down, cutting through Thunder's head.

As if time had stopped, everyone's eyes saw only the black long sword slicing through Thunder's head. The green mask shattered upon impact.

Blood splattered; Thunder's body lay on the ground, cracks appearing on his head, more severe than Chen Xiao's. However, with the mask shattered, Thunder's face appeared in Luo Tian's sight. Though he had guessed it before, his heart still tightened.

"Second Brother!" Luo Tian roared, rushing to Thunder's side and placing a pill into his mouth.

"Spit... Spitting..." Thunder coughed up blood, gazing at Luo Tian with a gentle expression. But he could no longer be called Thunder; now it was Lei Yong.

Lei Yong spat blood, his breath ragged. He wanted to speak but couldn't; Chen Xiao's strike was too heavy. Even though Lei Yong had quickly blocked it, he almost got split in two. His head was covered with blood.

"Die!" Black Night went completely mad, his body emitting black qi. His mask couldn't withstand Black Night's aura and shattered, revealing a cold face like a thousand-year-old ice. His appearance was none other than Ji Chen.

Ji Chen's eyes turned blood-red, his body instantly ignited with black flames. He seemed to be set ablaze, rushing toward Chen Xiao at lightning speed, almost a black line.

The relationship between Lei Yong and Ji Chen needed no explanation; they had been close since the Tianyuan Continent. Now that Lei Yong's life was uncertain, Ji Chen had gone completely mad.

"True Immortal!" Luo Tian roared, his phantom figure solidified completely within his dantian. Half black, half golden, it resembled a deity sitting in Luo Tian's dantian. At this moment, Luo Tian became an Extreme Stage True Immortal.

An invisible pressure radiated from Luo Tian's body, this pressure coming from the figures in his dantian. This pressure was nearly overwhelming; everyone in the hall felt this pressure.

Suppression, complete and unyielding suppression. Below the level of a half-step Immortal King, any True Immortal would have their cultivation suppressed before Luo Tian. Even True Immortality Peak was significantly more suppressed than True Immortality Early or Mid-Stage.

"No thunderstorm!" Luo Tian's eyes were bloodshot; he immediately understood. This hall had no True Immortal thunderstorm—perhaps it was the method of Di Zang Wang. Regardless of reason, Luo Tian had no time to think further; at this moment, his only thought was to kill Chen Xiao and avenge Lei Yong.

"Poof..." Blood splattered; the black dagger pierced Chen Xiao's shoulder, causing him further injury.

This strike also drained Black Night's cultivation and even his vitality, sending him to Lei Yong's side.

Chen Xiao's face was pale; he gazed at Lei Yong and Ji Chen, his condition not good either. He took deep breaths while Luo Tian's figure rushed toward him...

Chapter 2060: Killing Chen Xiao

A torrent of killing intent and fury filled Luo Tian's heart. At this moment, his heart felt like a fire burning; he directly charged toward Chen Xiao.

"Die! Without passing the True Immortal thunderstorm, you're still not a true immortal!"

"Even if you are an Extreme Stage True Immortal, how can that help? I am a True Immortality Late Stage; I can still kill you!" Chen Xiao roared, his withered hands raising the long sword again.

"Boom..." However, before Chen Xiao could raise his sword, Luo Tian's wild figure had already reached him, colliding with Chen Xiao's withered body.

Fast—extremely fast. Though Luo Tian was not yet True Immortality Early Stage, his aura surpassed it. Moreover, Chen Xiao's remaining cultivation was suppressed by two-thirds due to Luo Tian's Extreme Stage pressure.

With a thunderous sound, Chen Xiao was pushed back; he felt as if hit by a mountain. Blood spewed from his mouth.

Chen Xiao had already been severely wounded; the strike he used to kill Luo Tian had damaged him deeply. Black Night's dagger had also injured him, and with Luo Tian's Extreme Stage pressure, Chen Xiao no longer held an advantage.

"Again!" Luo Tian spat a thread of blood; after stopping his body, he immediately jumped off the ground toward Chen Xiao.

This time, however, Luo Tian didn't charge with his body but raised his fist. Upon reaching Chen Xiao's front, three times the body strength and True Immortal energy were added, striking toward Chen Xiao.

Chen Xiao's face was pale; he was still dazed. When he realized, Luo Tian had already reached him. He barely managed to block with his black long sword.

"Crush..." Luo Tian's aura surged fist struck the black long sword, pushing Chen Xiao back again.

Second punch followed immediately; then third...

Golden fists rained down on Chen Xiao, Luo Tian's body like a beast, completely wild.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sounds continued; Luo Tian kept attacking Chen Xiao, giving him no chance to breathe.

As Luo Tian's outburst continued, it was also due to the pressure of his Extreme Stage, which suppressed True Immortals. This allowed Xue Mian and Tianshu to gain the upper hand.

Before Luo Tian's outburst, due to their previous clash and injuries, they had been suppressed.

Though Luo Tian's suppression of Guiya and Tian Meng was minimal, it was enough for Xue Mian and Tianshu.

Xue Mian himself was also completely wild, his golden ice sword dancing constantly; a series of ice dragons surged toward Guiya, preventing him from facing the attack.

A black coffin slowly opened; Yang Huanyu appeared in the hall, seeing Luo Tian's wild attack on Chen Xiao and the wounded Lei Yong and injured Ji Chen. Yang Huanyu was surprised, then understood.

"Ah, I see. This is truly interesting!" Yang Huanyu sat cross-legged, not interfering with the chaos in the hall but began absorbing ghostly qi. After all, he had also expended a lot of energy.

Chen Xiao continuously roared, his frustration reaching its peak. Luo Tian's fists rained down like raindrops without giving him any chance to retaliate. The thought of being a True Immortality Late Stage warrior defeated by an unrefined kid was unbearable. If this continued, he might even die—Chen Xiao felt extremely distressed.

However, as time passed, Luo Tian's strength began to wane; his wild emotions gradually calmed.

"Still a bit short!" Luo Tian mused, currently Chen Xiao was being beaten into submission, his breath growing weaker. But to kill him with punches alone would take time; perhaps he'd die before Chen Xiao did.

"Buzz..." Thinking this, Luo Tian flew back and waved his hand; a blood-red small tower appeared in his grasp. This tower radiated an immense aura.

"Upper-grade divine artifact!" Seeing Luo Tian's blood-red small tower, Tian Meng and Tianshu's mouths twitched. They marveled at how Luo Tian had more upper-grade divine artifacts than them.

"He's not selling talismans; he's selling upper-grade divine artifacts!" Tianshu mused, then ignored others and resumed fighting Tian Meng. He wouldn't let go of this advantage.

"Buzz..." The blood-red tower radiated a tremendous fluctuation, and Luo Tian launched it. It descended from the sky toward Chen Xiao.

"Kid, do you think an upper-grade divine artifact can kill me? You're too naive!" Chen Xiao spat blood, his eyes burning with fury as he roared. He returned the long sword to his hand.

"Ghost Destruction!" Chen Xiao shouted, spitting blood onto the sword. A tiger's roar erupted from the long sword.

"Roar..." A black tiger emerged from the sword, its massive body roaring with a powerful pressure.

"It's an artifact soul!" Everyone's hearts tightened; the pressure from the black tiger made Ji Chen's face change.

An artifact soul, lacking sentience compared to an artifact spirit but just one step away from becoming one.

Chen Xiao pointed his finger, a drop of black blood flew out and merged into the black tiger's body. The tiger solidified into reality.

"Boom... Boom..." At the same time, Luo Tian activated the blood-red tower and pressed it downward toward the black tiger.

The tiger raised its head, opening its mouth as if to swallow the blood-red tower.

"This so-called upper-grade divine artifact is mine!" Chen Xiao laughed, and as the drop of black blood left his body, he became withered. Yet his eyes were filled with greed.

The thunderous sound shook the heavens; in an instant, the blood-red tower was devoured by the black tiger. The tiger's eyes emitted a painful sound.

The towering blood-red tower, which radiated immense power, was swallowed by the black tiger's body like a stone sinking into water. It caused no ripple at all.

"Yours?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with disdain; he extended his hand, sending out an invisible wave. A cold voice echoed from his mouth: "Burst!"
