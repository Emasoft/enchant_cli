“Just a mere elder, Bùtiān. Are you truly willing to take on my two immortal sects for the sake of a single elder?” Donghuang’s brows furrowed slightly. Bùtiān Xianwáng (Nascent Soul of Mending the Sky) was a master strategist, his cunning rendering him utterly formidable.

Chapter 2383: A Duel Against Two

“My Bùtiān Sect’s disciples are not so easily provoked. You know the truth of this matter, and it is not Luotian’s fault. Thus, I must take responsibility!” Bùtiān Xianwáng declared loudly, his voice resolute. Luotian’s eyes flickered with gratitude; he had not expected Bùtiān Xianwáng to so fiercely defend him. Though he shared a bond with Jiang Yuzé and Jiang Taibai, it was not enough to warrant Bùtiān Xianwáng’s personal intervention.

Bùtiān Xianwáng’s ascent to his current position was no accident; he would not risk clashing with both Yǒngshēng Xianwáng (Eternal Life Immortal King) and Donghuang.

“Even Hei Bai Wu Chang (Black and White Wuchang) acted thus!” Luotian’s eyes narrowed, recalling how Hei Bai Wu Chang had tolerated him in the past.

“I claim this brat!” Yǒngshēng Xianwáng’s voice was cold, his gaze fixed on Bùtiān Xianwáng. He recalled how Bùtiān Xianwáng had thwarted his clone in the Middle Heaven. To Yǒngshēng Xianwáng, Luotian’s worth surpassed the World Heart by far. Having found a pretext and with Donghuang at his side, how could he refrain from acting?

“Back when Dùtiān Xianwáng (Fallen Sky Immortal King) perished, do not think no one knows the truth!” Bùtiān Xianwáng sneered, his gaze locking onto Yǒngshēng Xianwáng with unyielding resolve.

“Dùtiān Xianwáng!” The name sent a ripple through the crowd, their eyes turning to Yǒngshēng Xianwáng.

Luotian and Zhang Ziping’s gazes darkened; they knew Dùtiān Xianwáng had been Zhang Daotian’s master, the pinnacle of the Tian Dao Sect. Yet his fate had sealed the sect’s decline and its eventual annihilation by Yǒngshēng Sect. Bùtiān Xianwáng’s words hinted at deeper truths entangled with Yǒngshēng Xianwáng.

Luotian’s heart churned with murderous intent, but he restrained himself—any outburst would spiral beyond control.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the immediate priority is to rescue those within. This youth is an Immortal King at the initial stage, a formidable force. Let him atone for his crimes!” A venerable figure from the Yàowáng Sect (Medicine King Sect) smiled, stepping forward to stand before Bùtiān Xianwáng.

Evidently, Huǒzhǔ (Fire Lord) had whispered to him, securing his allegiance. When Huǒzhǔ had seized the Sand Sea Imperial City, the major sects had vied for his favor. That era, Huǒzhǔ’s might was unmatched, securing the city through sheer strength. Now, he stood as an Immortal King at the middle stage—though still insignificant to these peaks, his worth was undeniable.

“I concur,” the peak cultivator of the Tian Hun Sect (Soul魂 Sect) and Duan Baohong of the Ghost King Sect nodded, unwilling to prolong the tension.

“First retrieve those inside. Once he emerges, you may settle your quarrel!” Duan Baohong spoke, his gaze fixed on Yǒngshēng Xianwáng. His lips moved subtly.

“Very well,” Yǒngshēng Xianwáng relented, though his power was unmatched, he lacked the audacity to confront multiple peaks.

“Your mission is not the World Heart or rescuing people, but retrieving this youth. Capture him alive if possible; death is acceptable otherwise,” Yǒngshēng Xianwáng conveyed to Nie Yuntian and others.

“Keep a close watch on him… ensure his capture!” The peak cultivators of other sects also instructed their subordinates. Both Bùtiān Xianwáng and Yǒngshēng Xianwáng sought Luotian, having sensed his uniqueness.

“Enough,” Yǒngshēng Xianwáng concluded, casting a cold glance at Luotian before issuing orders to his disciples.

“Buzz…” A cascade of radiant beams surged toward the spatial rift, yet only Bùtiān Sect’s disciples remained stationary.

“Exercise caution, especially you, Luotian!” Bùtiān Xianwáng’s gaze fell on Luotian, addressing Jiang Taibai and others without haste.

“Why aren’t Bùtiān Sect’s disciples entering?” The crowd grew impatient, observing Bùtiān Xianwáng lingering.

“Delaying time,” the crowd deduced instantly. The temporal flow of the Three Thousand Small Worlds differed from their Immortal Realm; a day equated to a year. Even if the realms clashed and rules shifted, the disparity remained vast.

Yǒngshēng Xianwáng and Donghuang’s expressions darkened; they had ordered their disciples to attack Luotian upon entry, but the delay risked wasting precious time.

“Go,” Bùtiān Xianwáng chuckled, knowing the crowd would not let him linger. He addressed Luotian and his companions.

“Let’s go! I’ll show who dares harm Bùtiān Sect’s disciples!” Jiang Taibai laughed, downing a cup of wine before charging into the stars.

Luotian followed Jiang Taibai, ascending into the heavens. Bùtiān Sect’s disciples rushed into the sky as well. Ye Liangchen remained with Bùtiān Xianwáng, for a half-Immortal King held little value.

The vast expanse of stars unfolded before Luotian’s eyes, yet no discomfort arose—Bùtiān Sect had once maintained a small world.

The starry void was immense yet eerily silent, drifting debris and fractured celestial continents littered the scene, their surfaces stained with blood, devoid of life.

“Finally!” As soon as they materialized, several figures surrounded them, eyes cold.

“Waiting for us long enough!” Two factions stood beneath the stars—Yǒngshēng Sect and Donghuang Sect. Each had an Immortal King at the middle stage, three at the initial stage, matching Luotian’s group.

“Nie Yuntian, do you think me a fool?” Jiang Taibai’s expression turned cold, recalling how Nie Yuntian had slain Luotian before his eyes on the Illusory Heaven Sea. That debt remained unpaid.

At that time, Jiang Taibai’s strength neared the middle stage; now fully entrenched in it, he looked down on Nie Yuntian.

“Attack as planned!” Nie Yuntian’s voice was icy, launching himself toward Luotian.

Futianhan bellowed, charging at Luotian as well. Beside Futianhan stood a middle-aged man, his gaze equally cold, striking toward Luotian. This was Futianhan’s younger brother, Futiankui—once wounded by Luotian.

“By your standards?” Zhang Ziping raised his sword, cold energy radiating from it, sweeping across the battlefield.

“Retreat! We cannot fight!” Zhang Ziping’s voice echoed in Luotian’s group.

Luotian was surprised; Jiang Taibai had conceded so quickly. Luotian said nothing, acknowledging their numerical disadvantage.

“Seal the Array!” Jiang Taibai’s intent to flee was met with refusal; instantly, overwhelming pressure swept the stars. Ninety-nine golden array flags rose from the void, encircling them.

“Then fight!” Jiang Taibai sheathed his sword, transforming into a streak of light toward Nie Yuntian. Yet an elder blocked his path.

Huǒzhǔ snarled, flames engulfing Meng Wushuang’s form. A crimson hand struck against Futianhan, who had closed in on Luotian.

“Crack!” The stars exploded, a thunderous roar echoing across the void—marking the battle’s beginning.

Jiang Yuzé and Zhang Ziping engaged their foes.

“Nie Yuntian, Futiankui—fight together! Settle old and new scores!” Luotian waved his hand, eyes cold. He recalled the two ambushes outside Jiutian City, nearly ending him in the depths of the Illusory Heaven Sea. Clutching Longyuan Sword, he slashed downward.

A black blade, like a streak of lightning, met Nie Yuntian’s long sword in midair.

“Stomp… stomp…” Luotian and Nie Yuntian both retreated, shattering the stars. Luotian’s eyes narrowed, yet his battle spirit surged.

Nie Yuntian’s strength neared the middle stage, his domain spanning over three thousand feet. Yet Luotian was no longer the helpless target he once was. Compared to Nie Yuntian’s progress, Luotian’s growth was far greater!

“Who gave you the courage?” As Luotian steadied himself, a cold voice echoed behind him. A golden sword radiated overwhelming sword intent, striking for his back. It was Futianhan, eyes brimming with killing intent.

“By your standards?” Luotian didn’t hesitate, his Longyuan Sword sweeping again. The clash sent him staggering back.

Fighting two opponents, Luotian wielded a second sword—Momo Sword—swinging it with ferocity against Nie Yuntian and Futiankui. The stars trembled violently, rupturing into chaos. Not only Luotian but Jiang Yuzé and Zhang Ziping also faced two opponents each. Only Jiang Taibai and Meng Wushuang clashed with equals.

An Immortal King’s wrath turned the heavens and earth. At this realm, strength differences were minimal. With two against one, Bùtiān Sect fell behind, including Luotian. Zhang Ziping, Jiang Yuzé, and Luotian had only recently ascended to Immortal King—though resourceful, they lagged.

Luotian fought with boldness, sustaining minor wounds that, though not fatal, hindered him.

“This won’t work!” Luotian fought while thinking. Clearly, the enemy’s target was himself; they dared not kill Jiang Taibai or Zhang Ziping. Their status within Bùtiān Sect was too high.

Chapter 2384: Blood Battle

Beneath the stars, a dozen figures clashed relentlessly. The void lay in ruins, its expanse of several million miles reduced to desolation. They had restrained themselves; otherwise, the entire starfield might have been annihilated—after all, they were Immortal Kings, surpassing the Heavenly Dao realm by many tiers.

“Normally, Yǒngshēng Xianwáng wouldn’t risk so much for a single individual,” Luotian wielded his twin swords, clashing against Nie Yuntian and Futiankui. A fog of confusion formed in his mind—Hei Bai Wu Chang had tolerated him, Bùtiān Xianwáng defended him, and Yǒngshēng Xianwáng even defied Bùtiān Xianwáng to capture him.

“Chronicle of the Epoch?” Luotian could only think of the Chronicle of the Epoch. He couldn’t fathom what else on him would warrant such fear from peak Immortal Kings. Only the Chronicle of the Epoch.

“Regardless, Bùtiān Xianwáng and Hei Bai Wu Chang have treated me well,” Luotian thought, focusing on the immediate crisis.

Nie Yuntian and Futiankui were seasoned masters from the Nine Immortal Sects, their strength far surpassing ordinary cultivators. Thus, Luotian found them formidable. This was his first encounter with opponents of equal rank; previously, he had been hunted by two, so he was cautious.

“Kill my son! Today I claim your head to honor his soul!” Nie Yuntian roared, his long sword flashing emerald light. It surged forward with ruthless intent, forgetting Yǒngshēng Xianwáng’s order to capture him alive.

The green swordlight radiated vitality, striking down. Luotian’s expression shifted; he twirled his swords, summoning a colossal black entity from the stars. Black mist obscured its form, but its ghostly claws radiated terrifying energy, clashing against the green swordlight.

“Burst!” A thunderous explosion shattered both Luotian and Nie Yuntian, blood spewing from their mouths.

“World of Verdant Growth!” Nie Yuntian, mid-air, unleashed a verdant domain. It engulfed Luotian, pressing down with overwhelming pressure.

“Rebirth!” Luotian remained undaunted, his body emitting a roar. The oppressive energy that had clung to him was instantly dispelled.

“Imperial Heaven Domain!” But as Luotian dispersed Nie Yuntian’s domain, Futiankui’s domain descended upon him. Together with Nie Yuntian’s, it crushed Luotian.

“Roar…” A gray-faced specter materialized within Luotian’s domain, howling. Standing firm, he endured the combined pressure of both domains.

“Dare you crush me with your domains? Your realms are insufficient!” Luotian coldly spoke, his gray domain clashing with theirs. The collisions echoed thunderously. Nie Yuntian and Futiankui felt a chill; Luotian’s domain was only a thousand feet, yet it matched theirs without yielding.

“Why isn’t his name on the Sealing Monument? Why is his domain unacknowledged by Heaven?” They pondered.

Their domains were vast, cultivated through their sects’ unique methods and tied to those of peak Immortal Kings. Yet they could not subdue Luotian’s Rebirth Domain.

Crackling sounds never ceased; the three seemed frozen in space, explosions echoing for a moment. A deafening roar resounded beneath the stars, an invisible wave sweeping outward and annihilating countless stars.

As their domains collapsed, they resumed combat. Luotian brandished his swords again, charging at Nie Yuntian.

“Manifestation of the Universe!” As he dashed, Luotian transformed into a ten-thousand-foot giant. His immense form radiated terrifying energy. In the Three Thousand Small Worlds, altered rules had restored his Manifestation of the Universe to ten thousand feet.

The black Longyuan Sword surged, exploding with power as it slashed downward.

“Eternal Life!” Nie Yuntian sensed a dire threat, his eyes narrowing. He channeled divine laws, summoning a lush green tree that enveloped him. Standing within its shadow, he wore a cold expression.

“Crash…” A thick branch lashed toward Luotian, but he severed it with a single strike. Yet the attack halted his advance.

“Buzz…” Luotian stopped, golden swordlight striking him. The overwhelming sword intent made his face pale; he raised Longyuan Sword to block.

“Crack!” Thunder roared, the stars exploded. Luotian’s face paled as he gazed at Futiankui, who stood ten thousand feet away.

“Sword Dao Fourth Stage!” Luotian murmured, taking a step forward and unleashing the seventh step of Fierce Steps. He landed on a willow branch.

Though he blocked one branch, several others pierced through, their sharpness slicing into his body. Luotian’s massive form felt a tremendous impact, sending him flying back with multiple blood holes. The branches hadn’t pierced his flesh but had inflicted severe injuries.

“Rustic villager! Dare to oppose us, two immortal sects?” Nie Yuntian coldly spoke. Yet he was astonished by Luotian’s flesh strength; others would have been pierced through.

“Fierce God Steps Again…” Luotian roared, ignoring his injuries and taking the second step of Fierce Steps. He clashed with golden swordlight.

The seventh step of Fierce Steps was formidable; even at the initial stage, Luotian’s power was earth-shattering. Yet it was only the second step—adequate against ordinary opponents but insufficient against Nie Yuntian and Futiankui, top-tier Immortal Kings at the initial stage.

“Boom!” Another explosion sent Luotian flying, shattering countless stars and spitting blood into the void.

Unknowingly, their battlefield had shifted from its original position. After relentless combat, they lost track of Zhang Ziping and Jiang Taibai’s whereabouts.

“Fierce God Steps Third!” Luotian steadied himself as Nie Yuntian and Futiankui’s attacks came again, refusing to grant him a moment of respite.

Explosions echoed; Luotian relied on his near-middle-stage flesh strength to endure until the sixth step. Yet his injuries were numerous.

“Fierce God Steps Sixth! Shatter Eternity!” Luotian panted, gazing at Nie Yuntian and Futiankui as he took the seventh step.

“Can he take more steps?” Seeing Luotian’s power surge again, Nie Yuntian and Futiankui felt immense pressure.

“Boom…” A massive foot, radiating primal energy, stomped down toward Futiankui’s swordlight.

“Burst!” The previously formidable swordlight shattered instantly, leaving only a few blood marks on Luotian’s foot. Still, it pressed forward toward Futiankui.

“Damn you!” Luotian roared, frustration boiling over. His dan Tian (cultivation core) churned with the Demon Altar, and thick mist surged through his ghost pulse into his right leg.

“Damn!” Futiankui’s face paled; he couldn’t react in time, raising his hands to meet Luotian’s crushing foot.

“Boom!” The stars echoed with a deafening roar. Futiankui’s body, like a meteor, plummeted downward, colliding with stars and continents.

“Fierce God Steps Seventh! Shatter Eternity!” Luotian ignored Futiankui’s fate and gazed at the willow tree spanning the stars, his eyes fierce. He took the seventh step.

An overwhelming aura radiated from Luotian, his foot adorned with dense demonic patterns. It surged toward the willow tree’s illusion.

“Kill…” A life-or-death crisis enveloped Nie Yuntian, his face contorting.

“Crash…” A flurry of willow branches rose, forming a green net over Nie Yuntian’s head. Unconvinced, he waved his hands, summoning a green door that roared with power. It radiated immense pressure and surged toward Luotian’s descending foot—Yǒngshēng Door.

Luotian’s face shifted, sensing a dire threat from the green Yǒngshēng Door. Yet his aura remained unyielding. His foot shattered the stars.

Luotian had unleashed the seventh step of Fierce Steps twice: once against Master Nan Wu’s demon shell, and now against Nie Yuntian. The first time, even with the seventh step, he had only blocked one palm from the demon shell and suffered heavy injuries. But this time, Nie Yuntian’s strength was far inferior to the demon shell. Luotian was confident he could at least severely wound Nie Yuntian, even if he couldn’t kill him.

“Boom…”

In an instant, their attacks collided. The stars trembled, then shattered like glass. The void erupted with a mirror-like fracture, scattering gray mist. Destructive power spread outward, forming a cataclysmic storm that swept across the starfield. Within several million miles, everything was reduced to nothingness.

“Spit…” Luotian spat blood, his massive form vanishing as the storm carried him away.

Nie Yuntian fared no better; Luotian’s foot had shattered the Yǒngshēng Door and crushed the willow net, breaking the tree trunk. Nie Yuntian spat blood as well, carried away by the storm.

The storm raged for a quarter-hour before subsiding. Luotian, pale-faced, stood beneath the stars, gazing into the distance.

The starfield lay in ruins; Luotian panted heavily, gripping Longyuan Sword as he charged toward Nie Yuntian.

“Today, you die!” As Luotian took a step forward, a streak of light rose from the stars—Futiankui had returned.

Chapter 2385: Reunion with an Old Acquaintance

Futiankui’s eyes gleamed with joy, materializing beside Luotian. His golden sword radiated cold light, striking toward him. At this moment, Futiankui sensed Luotian’s weakened state—this was the perfect opportunity to kill him.

Earlier, Futiankui had been sent flying for several million miles by Luotian’s foot. Yet he still felt the immense power from Luotian and Nie Yuntian’s clash.

“Did you forget?” Luotian gazed at the blinding cold light, his eyes flickering with amusement. He roared, and a thunderous dragon’s roar echoed from his mouth.

At that moment, Futiankui’s golden swordlight was near. His face remained joyful.

But as the dragon’s roar echoed, Futiankui’s expression froze. His mind roared with pain, his body trembling violently.

Luotian’s sonic martial art could counter the Buddha’s chants. With such proximity, Futiankui couldn’t withstand it—immediately, blood gushed from his seven orifices. His body stiffened and plummeted into the void.

“Spit… spit…” Even at several ten thousand feet away, Nie Yuntian felt the piercing sound. His wounds reopened, blood spilling from his mouth.

One roar shook heaven and earth; the entire starfield trembled with Luotian’s fury. Stars shattered, vanishing into the void.

“Who dies?” Luotian murmured to himself, gazing at Futiankui plummeting into the void. He waved his hand, and several black glows shot from it toward Futiankui.

Futiankui, blood gushing, fell near ten thousand feet before regaining his senses. His eyes widened with fear, recalling how Luotian had wounded him with the Soul-Cutting Sword.

After returning, Futiankui had spent a month recovering. Later, he sought the Emperor of Humanity to strengthen his soul. He hadn’t expected Luotian to have new methods, so powerful that even an Immortal King at the initial stage couldn’t withstand it.

As Futiankui was stunned, several black glows struck him. His face paled further; he spat blood and his aura surged.

“Puff… puff…” Futiankui’s reaction was swift, but it was still too slow for Luotian’s poison needles. Three glows pierced his body.

Corrosive intent spread, making Futiankui’s face grimace. He immediately channeled his cultivation to suppress the deadly toxin, pulling out the poison needles.

“Success rate is truly low,” Luotian frowned, having fired 108 poison needles. Previously, he had used some to poison Zhihong in the Zhao Tian Pagoda. Now, only three had pierced Futiankui’s body.

Though only three, they caused Futiankui immense pain. Already wounded, he was now poisoned—his state was at its worst.

The black silver needles hovered on Luotian’s hand, making him sigh; this item was used fewer each time.

Hefting the needles, Luotian’s face bore mockery as he soared into the sky toward Futiankui.

“Back then, you two chased me like a lost dog. Now it’s my turn!” Luotian murmured to himself, charging toward Futiankui.

Futiankui’s heart quivered; without hesitation, he fled. His current state couldn’t withstand a clash with Luotian.

But Luotian wouldn’t let him escape so easily, relentlessly pursuing and striking at Futiankui.

“Why are you chasing me?” Futiankui cursed inwardly, sensing Luotian’s speed was extraordinary. He couldn’t afford any slack.

Nie Yuntian panted, watching Luotian chase Futiankui into the void. He marveled at how quickly Luotian had grown.

“Only a few years, and he’s reached this level. No wonder my master ordered me to capture him!” Nie Yuntian murmured, his battered body flying away. He needed to recover his cultivation.

“Madman!” Compared to Nie Yuntian, Futiankui was far more wretched. Luotian’s state was much better; chasing him, Futiankui could only constantly unleash his speed to avoid being caught.

They chased for a day; Futiankui’s face was pale, and Luotian was also tired. Yet he relentlessly pursued Futiankui, his heart exhilarated.

“Are you crazy?” Futiankui cursed repeatedly; this was the first time he had seen Luotian like this. Despite his terrible state, he still chased him relentlessly.

“I’m so happy! Think about all these years I’ve been hunted!” Luotian’s heart laughed. If his voice weren’t hoarse, he would have shouted joyfully.

Time passed slowly; Futiankui could no longer endure. This small world was vast, but with their strength, they could traverse it in three or five days.

“I need to find my older brother!” Futiankui was nearly crying, his body constantly unleashing power. His form had thinned to a skeleton.

“Someone’s aura!” As Futiankui neared the center of the small world, he suddenly sensed a presence. His eyes lit up with joy.

“Comrades on this continent, help me! I am a disciple of the Donghuang Sect. I will surely reward you!” Futiankui, with his last strength, dove toward the massive continent.

The vast continent floated in the stars; Futiankui instantly brought Luotian into it.

“As long as someone helps me hold them off, I can escape!” Futiankui thought, imagining how to break free.

The continent was immense; Futiankui’s Immortal King initial stage spiritual sense instantly encompassed it. Yet the continent exuded an unusual aura, suppressing his spiritual sense. He could only sense someone at its center.

Luotian tore through space, appearing on the continent. As he arrived, he felt a familiar aura, his eyes narrowing in confusion. He still pursued Futiankui.

“Buzz…” The two chased each other toward the continent’s center when a golden domain suddenly rose from all sides, enveloping the entire continent.

“What’s going on?” Luotian and Futiankui both looked up, gazing at the sky encased in a barrier. Below the ground, immense suction forces emerged, pressing down on both with overwhelming pressure. Even their strength couldn’t resist it—both were pinned to the ground.

“Crack…” As Luotian pondered, a purple lightning bolt descended from the sky, striking him. His face instantly changed.

“Crash…” Thunderous roars erupted; multicolored lightning storms descended, turning the entire continent into a sea of thunder.

“Ten Thousand Heavens’ Divine Punishment!” As the lightning descended, Luotian instantly gasped. His heart was thrilled—only one person in the entire Immortal Realm could arrange this terrifying level: Wan Lingkong!

“Wan Lingkong, you bastard, let me out!” Luotian shattered a lightning bolt. A blue current entered his body, making him tremble. Yet he only shuddered once before beginning to evade.

Futiankui also evaded, but both were in terrible states. How could they dodge the dense lightning? Soon, they were battered and fleeing like rats.

It wasn’t just lightning; storms with corrosive raindrops fell. If Luotian and Futiankui had been at their peak, they could have handled it. Now, they could only defend, occasionally taking a hit—wretched beyond measure.

“Wan Lingkong, if you don’t let me out, I’ll die!” Luotian cursed. He had already taken over a dozen lightning strikes; his dan Tian (cultivation core) showed cracks.

“Ha!” As Luotian’s words finished, several figures appeared in his vision. Each held a golden array flag; the terrifying attacks avoided them.

“Damn!” Luotian cursed inwardly, though battered, his heart calmed slightly. He was thrilled.

The figures weren’t strangers—South Palace Yuqing and his group. Their faces bore ease, as if entering this small world had caused them no trouble.

“Big brother!” Long Jie stepped forward, eyes filled with excitement. It had been years since they’d seen each other.

“Ha! Luotian, how’s my array?” Wan Lingkong laughed, waving his hand and handing Luotian a flag. The terrifying lightning and other attacks instantly ceased their assault on him.

With Luotian no longer the target, the lightning focused on Futiankui, who had barely held out.

“Boom…” Futiankui was tortured to the extreme, his body howling as he finally collapsed, unconscious.

“Boom… boom…”

Futiankui’s body was struck by several lightning bolts, instantly turning into a mist of blood that scattered across the ground. A vast dust storm swept up.

“Too tragic,” Luotian panted, gazing at the spot where Futiankui had turned to dust. His eyes showed admiration.

“End it!” Wan Lingkong smiled, pointing his finger. The golden command flag flew out, becoming a streak of light that landed in the continent’s corner. The entire continent gradually calmed.

“Buzz…” As the calamities faded, a wave of energy rose from where Futiankui had been shattered. A single drop of blood floated upward, then transformed into a figure resembling Futiankui—his eyes filled with terror.

“Forgot about this! Blood Rebirth!” Diao Dezhu’s face lit up with realization. He looked at Futiankui with ill intent, making the latter tremble and shiver.

Chapter 2386: World Barrier

“I’m alive!” Futiankui’s eyes were filled with terror; he had truly feared death.

“Indeed, you are,” As Futiankui was bewildered, a purple figure appeared before him. A foot kicked his body, sending him flying.

“Boom…” Futiankui spat blood, collapsing on the ground. Others rushed in, repeatedly kicking his body, making him howl.

“Even an Immortal King initial stage?!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes gleamed with arrogance. His aura was supreme.

Luotian gazed at Diao Dezhu, his heart trembling; Diao Dezhu’s aura was overwhelmingly powerful. Even Luotian felt a tremendous pressure.

“This is possible?” Luotian’s heart shook, glimpsing a shadow behind Diao Dezhu—backing the world.

“Haha, Luotian was stunned speechless! Ha!” Ren Hongzhe and Li Tianzhi laughed.

“Looks like this guy has mastered his act,” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, addressing Luotian.

“Keep it up; you’ve got potential!” Luotian patted Diao Dezhu’s shoulder, for the first time not kicking him but encouraging.

“Do you think my path is this?” Hearing Luotian’s words, Diao Dezhu’s eyes became even more excited. He was thrilled to have someone acknowledge him.

“Indeed!” Luotian nodded. Any path cultivated to its peak could become a formidable technique. Diao Dezhu’s method had saved their lives multiple times.

“How did you arrive?” Nan Gong Yuqing asked, eyes filled with excitement as they looked at Luotian. They could sense he had become an Immortal King.

“It’s a long story…” They collected Futiankui, not killing him—Futiankui was needed to negotiate with Donghuang Sect for Fu Xingyang. They arrived at a mountain peak, recounting their experiences.

Nan Gong Yuqing’s group hadn’t planned to enter here; they were merely half-Immortal Kings. Yet Yǒngshēng Xianwáng had thrown them in, leaving no choice.

They hadn’t sought the World Heart but found this continent, setting up everything. Wan Lingkong had set up hundreds of arrays; when Luotian and Futiankui arrived, he only opened a dozen.

This was their greatest reliance—hundreds of arrays built by Wan Lingkong, meant to counter any surprises. They hadn’t expected Luotian.

The World Heart was at the center of this small world; the cultivators had gathered there. Nan Gong Yuqing’s group didn’t know their progress, nor did they desire to compete—this was beyond their reach.

“Once we leave this place, head to the Lower Heaven. The Battle for the Heavens is about to begin!” Luotian spoke softly, clearly happy to meet Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Tianyuan Sect has been established; Xiang Tianming’s master has been found…” Luotian recounted much. They stood on the mountain peak, time passing quickly—three hundred years had made them Immortal Realm masters.

“I miss home a bit,” Long Jie’s eyes held a trace of nostalgia, murmuring.

“Will we meet the Nine Domains again?” Diao Dezhu sighed longingly, standing on the mountain peak, gazing into the distance.

“Indeed,” Luotian spoke softly, recalling the image of the Nine Domains colliding with another star cluster.
