The cries of battle roared to the heavens. In a mortal realm, there were one or two million people, with some regions boasting up to three or four million. In their eyes, life held no value; anyone who was human was slain without mercy. Corpses littered the land, and all of the Four Sacred Star Domains fell into boundless despair. The people of Ming Domain killed with a speed even swifter than crushing an ant.

Veins of blood qi surged skyward, drawn into the void by a grand array arranged by five Saint-level masters. The blood qi flowed into Ming Domain.

"Devil!" The mortals of the Four Sacred Star Domains were slaughtered relentlessly, with hundreds or thousands dying every moment.

...

Within Fire Domain's Tongtian Mountain, Luo Tian had been living comfortably these days, spending time with his wife and children. He often joined Gu Lei and Zheng Xin for drinks and idle chatter.

Today, the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains gathered beneath Fire Domain's starry sky. Their eyes carried a touch of excitement, for just days prior, Luo Tian had consulted with the heads of several sects. Today they would return to the Four Sacred Star Domains, carrying the Ancient Palace of the Past—surely they could face any challenge.

Fire Domain's proximity to the Demon Realm meant Luo Tian had already communicated with Diao Yuanshan. If any calamity arose in Fire Domain, Diao Yuanshan would come to aid.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian cradled his son Luo Li, accompanied by his four wives. Standing among the crowd, he wore a faint smile as he gazed toward the Four Sacred Star Domains. He had missed them.

"Everyone, if you are ready, let us depart!" Luo Xiong and the heads of several sects stood at the forefront. Their faces bore a touch of nostalgia.

After Luo Xiong and the others spoke, they led the way toward Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong's array. They stepped into the teleportation formation.

Others moved swiftly, joining the formation. As a hundred thousand people stood within it, they awaited Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong to activate the array.

"Let's go!" Wan Lingkong shouted, and he and Jiang Nanxuan unleashed a stream of seals into the array.

"嗡……" The teleportation formation activated, its immense power enveloping the people.

In an instant, the transport force surged—but the hundred thousand standing within the formation remained untouched.

"Damn it! Wan Lingkong, you bastard didn't do this right again!" Xu Liyiye felt something was wrong and quickly leapt out of the formation, fearing another mishap like before.

"Indeed! Why isn't it working?" Wan Lingkong's face showed confusion, glancing at Jiang Nanxuan, who also wore a puzzled expression.

"What's going on?" The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains stared at Wan Lingkong, awaiting an explanation.

As they pondered why the array had failed, Lu Hantian, Du Hongtao, and Wang Xuanyang appeared before Luo Tian's group.

"Lu Tian, come out. It's not the array's fault—something has happened in the Four Sacred Star Domains! You cannot return!" Lu Hantian spoke softly, his voice heavy with urgency.

Seeing the solemn expressions of the three men, Luo Tian's face darkened as he awaited their explanation.

"Dark Domain has begun its uprising!" Lu Hantian spoke clearly, and the words sent a shockwave through the crowd.

Chapter 1134: Anger Fueled by Flames

Beyond Fire Domain's Tongtian Mountain, the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains stood in formation. Upon hearing Lu Hantian's words, all felt their hearts sink, a foreboding sense rising. Especially those from the Tianyuan Continent, who had previously endured the upheaval of Wangyue Sect. Yang Huanyu had opened the entrance to the Dark Domain, and only by burning their lives had Zhang Daotian and three others sealed it. Otherwise, the Tianyuan Continent might have already become a territory of the Dark Domain.

"Someone said the entire Four Sacred Star Domains is now enclosed by a grand array, emitting intense blood qi that has even spread to Fire Domain," Lu Hantian said with a grave expression.

"Four Sacred Star Domains!" The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains' eyes turned crimson as they gazed toward the stars. Their gazes locked onto the direction of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Let's go back and fight! We can't just watch as the Four Sacred Star Domains is occupied!" The people murmured, their eyes turning to Luo Tian, Luo Xiong, and Sha Cangmang.

"Stay calm. Although the Dark Domain has rarely acted in recent years, it holds the top position among the Nine Domains. Its strength is beyond ours. Even if we combine with Fire Domain's forces, we would be exhausted and barely survive. Moreover, our highest cultivation is merely three Saint-level masters within the Ancient Palace of the Past. Returning now would be suicide!" Luo Tian finally stepped forward, his voice resolute.

"But this is our home! And the Dark Domain always kills even commoners, acting with brutal ferocity. A domain's core strength lies in its cultivators, but commoners are the foundation of a domain. Who among us didn't start as a commoner?" The people's faces showed anxiety, their voices rising in debate.

"Stay calm. I'll go alone to investigate the situation. If it's feasible, I'll send you a message. If not, we may have to abandon the Four Sacred Star Domains for now!" Luo Tian sighed deeply and addressed them.

"I'll accompany you," Jiang Nanxuan said with a faint smile. The only thing that could make Dongbixi清醒 for an hour was Jiang Nanxuan's greatest card. A single Dongbixi could destroy a sacred domain, provided he was willing to die for Jiang Nanxuan.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded. He knew Jiang Nanxuan's strength and didn't stop him, but he prevented Gu Lei and others from following. It was too dangerous; Luo Tian didn't want to lose another soul in the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"I'll take the Ancient Palace of the Past!" Luo Tian addressed them, his hands flashing as a golden palace rose from Tongtian Mountain. It shrank to palm size and rested in Luo Tian's hand.

"Be careful, I fear the Dark Domain may not only attack the Four Sacred Star Domains but also Fire Domain and other regions!" Luo Tian's face bore deep concern as he reiterated to the people. He and Jiang Nanxuan then became two streaks of light, vanishing from sight.

"Hope the situation isn't as bad as we fear," Luo Xiong and others sighed, leading the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains back to Tongtian Mountain. The entire mountain and Fire Domain grew tense, for Fire Domain's proximity to the Four Sacred Star Domains meant that other sects would inevitably learn of this great calamity.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan became two streaks of light, arriving at the border between Fire Domain and the Four Sacred Star Domains after half a day. Not through the endless fire sea, but another safer entrance.

"嗡……"

Through the passage, they appeared beyond the Four Sacred Star Domains. Their expressions darkened immediately.

A crimson barrier enveloped the entire Four Sacred Star Domains, and within it, waves of blood qi surged endlessly. It seemed to dye the entire starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Domains red. Even through the barrier, the intense blood qi seeped into Fire Domain via the inter-domain passage.

"Beasts!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with killing intent. So much blood qi—how many lives had to be taken to produce such a vast amount of death and blood qi? It was unprecedented in Luo Tian's life!

"Let's go!" Without hesitation, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan rushed into the Four Sacred Star Domains. Everywhere there were people of the Dark Domain, slaughtering the inhabitants of the Four Sacred Star Domains on every living continent.

In an instant, they arrived at a living continent. Compared to the vastness of the Four Sacred Star Domains, this one was but a speck. It held only several million people—pitifully few.

A middle-aged man in gray robes strode across the continent, his eyes filled with cruelty. As he moved through the sky, countless commoners died at each location. His hands struck repeatedly, and men, women, and children turned into streams of blood qi, soaring skyward into the vast void fissures, flowing into the Dark Domain.

"Pathetic! Truly pathetic!" The gray-robed man killed as if reaping wheat, mercilessly harvesting the lives of this continent's people.

"Who will save us? We've always lived in peace! Why is this happening?" Desperate cries echoed across the continent, each one tugging at Luo Tian's heart.

"Are you strong?" Luo Tian appeared beside the man in an instant, his hand swinging and striking the middle-aged man's face.

"Boom!" The gray-robed man was merely at the Supreme Stage. Against Luo Tian, a Saint-level master in his late stage, he couldn't react. Before he could kill the commoners, his head felt as if it would be torn off.

Blood gushed from seven orifices. The gray-robed man crashed into the ground, no longer with his former haughty demeanor. A deep pit formed in the eyes of the terrified local residents.

Luo Tian's body shimmered with golden light, standing in the sky. His foot shot out like a meteor, crushing the gray-robed man beneath his heel.

"Crack..." The sound of bones breaking echoed. Luo Tian's cold gaze fell upon the man under his foot.

"Who are you?" The gray-robed man's eyes showed fear. He hadn't expected to encounter a Saint-level master.

"I am Luo Tian!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate. His purple eyes locked onto the man, and he immediately initiated a soul-searching technique.

After three breaths, Luo Tian's expression darkened. He crushed the man with his hands, and through the man's memories, he grasped a rough understanding of what had transpired in the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Dark Domain! All should die!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness. He raised his hand, summoning the Ancient Palace of the Past.

"Jiang Xiong, use the Ancient Palace to bring all these people inside. I'll go check other continents—let's save as many as we can!" Luo Tian addressed Jiang Nanxuan,凝聚 a golden key of saintly power and inserting it into Jiang Nanxuan's body.

"Good!" Jiang Nanxuan said nothing. His usually calm demeanor showed rare anger, his face dark as he nodded in agreement. He knew they couldn't save everyone from a million Dark Domain troops, but saving some was possible.

"Shoo…" Luo Tian became a streak of gold and vanished. His vast spiritual awareness spread out, searching for living continents.

Jiang Nanxuan, meanwhile, activated the Ancient Palace and moved across the continent where they had just appeared. He continuously brought its people into the Ancient Palace.

"He said he's Luo Tian, our Four Sacred Star Domains' prodigy? Is he here to save us?" The people of the continent wept, their voices trembling. Just a moment ago, this entire continent had been wiped out by that devil.

"Yes! He is Luo Tian. I'll take you away first. One day, we will return to avenge!" Jiang Nanxuan addressed the people.

"Don't resist. I'll take you to a safe place!" Jiang Nanxuan urged, continuously bringing people into the Ancient Palace.

"Northwest ten thousand miles!" As Jiang Nanxuan finished gathering them, Luo Tian's voice echoed through a jade tablet in his mind.

"Good. I've merged with the Heaven-Devil Flower, otherwise activating this Ancient Palace would have drained a Saint-level master in early stage!" Jiang Nanxuan sighed, his face showing a wry smile. He moved swiftly and vanished from the empty continent.

In the outer regions of the Four Sacred Star Domains, most of those who attacked were from the Dark Domain's Supreme Stage. The outer regions had fewer continents and populations, while deeper areas held more people with stronger cultivators—some even at the Supreme Stage. To minimize losses, the five Saint-level masters of the Dark Domain had divided their forces effectively, using overwhelming power to slaughter the Four Sacred Star Domains' people.

Thus, Luo Tian encountered no resistance as he pushed forward. He killed any Dark Domain presence without giving them a chance, saving many people in the process. However, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan had arrived too late; most continents were already wiped out, leaving only desolate ruins. The Dark Domain's people had finished their slaughter and were gradually gathering toward the Tianyuan Continent.

As Luo Tian delved deeper, he encountered Dark Domain warriors growing stronger—from Supreme Stage to late Saint-level.

"Blood's scent is truly exquisite. Unfortunately, I can't use it now!" In the Tianyuan Continent, where the Dark Domain's forces gathered, a young figure lounged on a chair. He exhaled deeply, absorbing waves of blood qi into his nose.

"Master's words are true. However, Master could also stretch his limbs a bit. The Four Sacred Star Domains is the weakest among the Nine Domains. Killing several continents would be a good warm-up!" Five Saint-level masters sat beside the youth, their faces showing respect as they responded.

Chapter 1135: Luo Tian's Plan

Under the blood-stained starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian stood with a face full of killing intent. He pushed forward toward the Tianyuan Continent, encountering more people as he approached.

"Who are you?" Another lifeless continent. Luo Tian finally met a late Saint-level master, an old man in gray robes. His eyes showed caution as he gazed at Luo Tian's surging qi.

"Kill!" Luo Tian didn't waste words. His body flashed, becoming a streak of light as he rushed toward the old man. The Dao-Defying Fist swung, piercing through the heavens and striking the old man with overwhelming intent.

"Die!" The old man's face showed anger. He had never feared others from the other domains, especially not a young man.

"Your talent is remarkable. Killing you would be a great achievement!" The old man's face showed grimness, his gray saintly power swirling around his fists as he clashed with Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's fist was all-out, giving no chance for the old man to recover. The power was overwhelming.

The old man had long been accustomed to ignoring life, but Luo Tian's fist's power was clear. His heart felt heavy, yet he fought with all his might.

"Boom..." A golden and gray figure collided in the sky. The old man's face showed intense shock, his fist shattering and spreading throughout his body.

"Boom!" The old man was decisive. He severed one arm, blood gushing from his shoulder as he stood in the sky.

"I see how many punches you can endure!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He had rarely seen a late Saint-level master withstand his first punch and only lose an arm. The old man was no ordinary foe.

"Your methods in the Dark Domain are not something you can comprehend!" The old man's heart was heavy, but his words showed no retreat. He reached out, and the people on the continent turned into streams of blood mist, rising into his body. His severed arms regenerated instantly, and he returned to his peak.

"With enough blood qi, I am immortal!" The old man's face showed a faint smile. His eyes regarded the commoners and low-level cultivators on the continent as mere sustenance.

"Die!" Luo Tian's face darkened. He could wound the enemy but couldn't kill him in one strike. The enemy would regenerate by killing people, indirectly causing the deaths of innocent lives—something Luo Tian refused to allow.

"Kill!" Seeing Luo Tian's hesitation, the old man smiled and attacked without restraint.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The gray fists struck repeatedly. Luo Tian had no choice but to defend, yet he dared not use his full strength. The old man's severed arm had cost tens of thousands of lives, and if he was injured further, more would be needed to heal him. Luo Tian could only endure.

"Kid, fight back!" The old man laughed wildly, his gray fists striking Luo Tian's repeatedly.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed mentally but held back, enduring the blows silently.

"Haha! A prodigy? A useless coward who won't fight back!" The old man laughed, his body moving swiftly. His hands flew, and gray saintly power surged, forming a massive gray seal that shot from his hand.

"Dark King's Seal!" The gray seal, imbued with immense power, shattered the void and appeared before Luo Tian.

"Go!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. His hands moved, and the Kai Tian Seal emerged from the void, colliding with the gray seal. The collision produced a thunderous sound, and an invisible wave spread across the continent.

"Ah..." A scream echoed. Many commoners died in the invisible waves, deepening Luo Tian's grim expression.

"Can't use martial arts! Can't let him be injured. How to fight? Unless one strike kills!" Luo Tian's mind was deep in thought, watching the countless commoners die from the collision of two martial arts. Cold sweat dripped down his face.

"This kid is truly dangerous! How strong!" The old man's heart was heavy as he gazed at Luo Tian, then carefully observed him.

"You!" After careful observation, the old man finally recognized Luo Tian. He had previously seen Luo Tian as just a prodigy from the Nine Domains, but now he realized who he was.

"Seems fate has given me a great achievement. The Book of Epochs is with you. Hand it over, and I might be lenient enough to spare these commoners!" The old man smiled, issuing a threat.

"Impossible!" Luo Tian's hands rose, and waves of blue-green flames surged through the void. The flames danced in his hand.

"Blazing Heaven's Fire Array!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and the blue-green fire surged skyward. It became a raging wave, rushing toward the old man.

"What is this!" The old man's face changed. He dodged into the void, sensing the dangerous aura within the Blue-Glass Jade Fire. Any contact would be a devastating strike capable of burning everything.

"Where are you running!" Luo Tian's face showed a cold smile. After much thought, he had found a way to prevent the old man from escaping. His powerful spiritual awareness enveloped the Blue-Glass Jade Fire, which became sentient and immediately wrapped around the old man.

"Ah..." A scream echoed. The old man was instantly burned by the Blue-Glass Jade Fire, suffering excruciating pain that consumed his soul with terrifying temperatures.

"I'll die, but you won't fare well!" The old man roared. He pointed his hand, and the arm not yet burned shattered into a wisp of smoke, floating into the sky. In an instant, it escaped beyond the domain.

"I've found Luo Tian!" As the smoke drifted into space, all Dark Domain people's minds simultaneously echoed with the old man's voice.

"Who!"

"Luo Tian! Luo Tian has arrived in the Four Sacred Star Domains!" The entire Four Sacred Star Domains' Dark Domain people erupted. Even the killing Dark Domain masters paused, their eyes deep.

In the Tianyuan Continent, five Saint-level masters showed joy on their faces. They respectfully gazed at the youth seated before them, speaking softly: "Master, let's capture that kid. It would be a great achievement for you at the Grand Elder's eyes."

"Order everyone to stop all actions immediately. Gather our forces and kill Luo Tian!" The youth's face also showed joy, his blood-stained wine cup shattering. With five Saint-level masters, they vanished from the hall.

"Go!" The Dark Domain people heard the youth's order and immediately stopped all actions, rushing toward Luo Tian's continent.

...

On the continent where Luo Tian stood, people looked at him with reverence. They had witnessed the battle and the deaths of many. Their faces showed devotion as they knelt before Luo Tian, bowing repeatedly.

Luo Tian gazed at the commoners, his eyes filled with admiration. He looked toward the void as Jiang Nanxuan appeared on this continent, and the Ancient Palace of the Past thundered in, continuously gathering people from the continent.

"I can sense powerful energy approaching!" Jiang Nanxuan's face showed tension as he addressed Luo Tian.

"It must be the old man I killed who revealed our position!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light. A bold idea formed in his mind.

"We can't stay long. If surrounded, we'll have to use Dongbixi as our last resort!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly.

"No. Dongbixi is too unstable. If I'm not mistaken, your chance of awakening him is also low! If he can't be awakened, it might become a disaster for the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying admiration.

"Indeed. But it's worth a gamble! I have about a 60% chance of awakening Dongbixi, allowing him to return to normal for about a minute!" Jiang Nanxuan nodded slightly.

"I have a plan. It's risky, but it can save many remaining commoners in the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Luo Tian shook his head, gazing at the void. He flashed to the domain's edge and transmitted a message to Jiang Nanxuan.

"I'll draw out the Dark Domain masters. You take the opportunity to gather those who haven't been slaughtered!" Luo Tian left only one sentence before vanishing into the stars.

"No way!" Jiang Nanxuan flashed after Luo Tian. This approach was too risky—single-handedly facing the Dark Domain's many masters was impossible.

"I've decided!" Luo Tian's face showed determination. His voice carried no room for argument.

Jiang Nanxuan saw Luo Tian's determined gaze and knew he couldn't stop him. He sighed deeply, extended his hand, and a petal of the Heaven-Devil Flower was placed into Luo Tian's hands. The Ancient Palace of the Past also released three sacred herbs, landing before Luo Tian.

Chapter 1136: Death-Defying Escape

Under the starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian's face was grim. He collected three sacred herbs and a petal of the Heaven-Devil Flower, addressing Jiang Nanxuan: "You keep giving me these Heaven-Devil petals. Isn't it harmful to you?"

"It's fine. Rest for a while," Jiang Nanxuan shook his head, indicating Luo Tian was unharmed.

Luo Tian gazed at Jiang Nanxuan deeply. He knew the Heaven-Devil Flower had only nine petals, and such a precious item couldn't be so easily dismissed.

"Also, take Dongbixi with you. If it's necessary, release him!" Jiang Nanxuan seemed still uneasy and summoned a massive altar that appeared in the stars.

"This..." As the altar appeared, immense pressure enveloped Luo Tian, making it hard for him to breathe.

The altar was covered in runes. Dongbixi's aged body sat upon it, his eyes closed. Black and white qi surrounded him, like a statue.

"Keep it. You have the Heaven-Devil petal; there shouldn't be any major issues!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

"Ah! If necessary, I'll release this great being. Even if he's in a mad state, he could destroy the one million Dark Domain troops!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness. He vanished from sight.

"Alas..." Jiang Nanxuan sighed, activating the Ancient Palace of the Past and vanishing into the void to find continents with remaining life.

...

"Boom..." Just a few seconds after Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan separated, the stars collapsed. Figures appeared at their former location.

"Left? You moved fast! But you can't escape—your scent has touched the Dark Domain's masters. No matter where you go, you can't escape!" The young man smiled playfully, gazing at the void.

"Chase!" Five Saint-level masters ordered their people behind them. Their voices carried authority as they vanished.

The stars shattered, and the Dark Domain's forces surged like a giant beast. They followed the young man as he pursued Luo Tian.

"How fast!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed. He felt the danger approaching, especially with five Saint-level masters pressing heavily on him.

"Run!" Luo Tian's body flashed like lightning, his Yellow-Shadow Ghost Step at its peak. He moved like teleportation through the blood-stained starry sky, his movements weaving through the devastated Four Sacred Star Domains. His hatred for the Dark Domain deepened, even feeling a desire to release Dongbixi and destroy them all.

But he knew he couldn't. If Dongbixi fell into a mad state, the first to be killed would be himself. Even if he destroyed this million-strong force, the Dark Domain would send stronger forces. This would accelerate their invasion and endanger Fire Domain's people as well.

"Fast speed!" Luo Tian, in his anger, saw the Dark Domain youth's face show shock. He had thought himself among the top in the nine Dark Domain sons, but Luo Tian's speed was faster. His own speed could barely keep up, and he even fell behind.

"He is the one who caused the Nine Domains' chaos. He's truly remarkable!" Five Saint-level masters of the Dark Domain showed admiration, gazing at the direction where Luo Tian fled.

"What's remarkable about it? He's just a late Saint-level kid. How much trouble can he cause? I've heard he only has the support of a Grand Elder and an Intermediate Grand Elder!" Another Saint-level master showed disdain. A late Saint-level master was easy to kill for them.

"Master, should we speed up and help you capture him?" Five Saint-level masters spoke, their voices confident.

"Good. The matter of the Book of Epochs is important. Let's capture him first!" The Dark Domain youth nodded slightly.

"Go!" Five Saint-level masters left three to protect the young man, and two flashed away into the Dark Domain's sight.

"Can't continue like this. The enemy has Saint-level masters; if they really want to catch me, it's too easy!"

"I must have left an imprint on the old man I killed. That's why they found my direction!" Luo Tian muttered, darting through the familiar Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Buzz..." The blue-green flames continuously flowed within Luo Tian's body, clearing any strange qi.

"Can't. The kid found the imprint. His scent is getting weaker!" Two Saint-level masters' faces changed, their speed increasing as they chased Luo Tian.

"Here he comes!" Luo Tian could clearly feel two Saint-level masters breaking away from the group, chasing him. Their distance was closing.

"Damn it! I'll fight!" Luo Tian used all his strength, his eyes flashing with madness. His speed increased again; he knew if caught by two Saint-level masters, he had no chance.

"Shi..." A wisp of smoke flew from Luo Tian's body, dispersing into the stars. At that moment, all Dark Domain people lost their感应 of Luo Tian.

"Kid, do you think we can't find you?" Two Saint-level masters stopped at the place where Luo Tian had been. Their faces showed cold smiles as they moved their hands, releasing gray runes that gradually凝聚 into a blood-red shadow. If Luo Tian were here, he would be shocked—this shadow was identical to the one he had killed.

"Dark Soul's Path!" The two old men smiled coldly, gazing at the blood-red shadow. "Lead us to find the one who killed you!"

"Buzz..." Upon hearing their words, the blood-red shadow trembled. Its crimson eyes showed intense hatred. It inhaled deeply and then rushed toward the direction where Luo Tian had disappeared.

At this moment, Luo Tian had completely escaped from most of the Dark Domain's people. Only two Saint-level masters chased him.

"Everyone, disperse and find Luo Tian! Whoever finds his location will be rewarded!" The Dark Domain's young master showed a grim face as he addressed the people.

"Yes!" His command was absolute. One million Dark Domain people instantly dispersed, searching for Luo Tian's location.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian darted through the Four Sacred Star Domains like a meteor, constantly moving between its regions. The two Saint-level masters followed him like leeches, barely keeping up. This was only because the blood-shadow's speed wasn't fast enough; otherwise, Luo Tian would have already been caught.

Meanwhile, the other Dark Domain people scattered across every corner of the Four Sacred Star Domains, searching for Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was powerful, but against such a vast search effort, he was like a lost dog, constantly fleeing through the Four Sacred Star Domains.

In an instant, one day passed as Luo Tian fled. His body was quite battered, but the Four Sacred Star Domains were vast. He still encountered Dark Domain people who blocked his path.

Fortunately, the opponents he met weren't too strong. However, this was enough to trouble Luo Tian, for two Saint-level masters were still chasing him. If caught, he would be dead.

"Boom!" Luo Tian punched a Saint-level Dark Domain master who blocked his path. His face showed exhaustion as he glanced back, hearing the thunderous sound of approaching Saint-level masters.

"Real pests!" Luo Tian's eyes showed coldness. He vanished from the spot, flying as he summoned his Shangtian Bow. The bowstring was drawn to its peak, and golden saintly power凝聚 into a golden arrow in his hand. It shot from his hand, piercing through the stars and vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

"Watch out!" The next moment, two Saint-level masters following the blood-shadow's path showed shock. They felt the immense power within the golden arrow and sensed a great danger.

Luo Tian was now at late Saint-level, having mastered various powerful techniques. The arrow shot by the Shangtian Bow could wound even a Saint-level master.

"Trivial tricks!" One old man sneered, extending his hand to summon a large gray hand. It reached for the golden arrow.

"Buzz..." But in an instant, the golden arrow suddenly exploded. Its speed increased again, breaking its original trajectory and rushing toward the two Saint-level masters.

"Boom!" The two masters quickly raised two gray shields to protect themselves. However, their expressions changed because the golden arrow's target wasn't them but the blood-shadow in front of them.

At this moment, Luo Tian stood at an unknown distance from them.

"Good luck! I actually hit it!" Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the blood-red stars. But he saw a gray young figure rapidly approaching him.

Chapter 1137: Pressing Toward the End of Heaven's Cliff

Under the starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian's face darkened as he gazed at the young man in gray robes. A powerful aura radiated from him, and his eyes showed joy as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Who are you?" Luo Tian's gaze was heavy, his voice calm as he addressed the young man who blocked him. He felt an aura comparable to Sun Miechen's within the young man.
