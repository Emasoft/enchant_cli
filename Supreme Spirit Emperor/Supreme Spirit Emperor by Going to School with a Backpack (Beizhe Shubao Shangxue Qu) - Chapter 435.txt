“Luo Tian, did you not expect this? This Heaven-Defying God-Slaying Array was passed down to us by our alliance leader. Once activated, it can crush even an Epoch Lord!” The old man commanding the array wore a mad grin.

At this moment, they had waited for so long. Among these people, each bore an unquenchable hatred toward Luo Tian—his very presence had shattered their lives. Their sects, once mighty in their respective starfields, had plummeted into ruin because of him. Some had been wiped out by his hand; others had spent years evading their enemies.

Only hatred remained in their hearts—overwhelming, boiling hatred that had bound them together. Now, at last, it erupted.

“I see! It’s the aura from those two!” Luo Tian mused, his eyes widening in disbelief as his body trembled involuntarily.

“What is it?” Man Hun asked, confusion etched on his face. He wanted to know what had caused Luo Tian such alarm.

“Huangquan!” Luo Tian’s face darkened as he spoke the two words, causing Man Hun to pale.

“I once barely entered Huangquan in my past life. At the final moment, I saw it—standing atop Huangquan were two figures emitting that very aura. But this one is a thousand times stronger!” Luo Tian explained.

“Huangquan messengers! My heavens, you actually saw the Huangquan messengers!” Man Hun’s face contorted in disbelief. He stared at Luo Tian, his mouth agape.

“Do you know about them?” Luo Tian asked, puzzled. Though he had heard of Huangquan’s existence before, it was only a vague rumor.

“I learned about them from our Man clan’s ancient texts. I thought it was just a legend, a fabrication by our ancestors. I never believed it to be real… but now it is!” Man Hun’s expression was stunned.

“Tell me more,” Luo Tian said, his interest piqued. He wanted to know the origins of those two formidable beings.

“The old text only mentioned that Huangquan messengers were powerful. It said someone from our clan had failed to ascend during a trial, but their soul remained and entered the cycle of rebirth. They encountered the Huangquan messengers who guided them into hell,” Man Hun recounted.

“But what happened to that elder after? We don’t know. Since you’ve seen the Huangquan messengers, it means hell is real!” Man Hun’s voice trembled with awe.

“Does failing an ascension trial send one to hell?” Luo Tian frowned, then asked: “What was their cultivation level back then?”

“Not a Lord. They had lived through a second life, but their strength was near the level of a Lord. That’s why they felt the call from the Immortal Realm and tried to ascend,” Man Hun sighed.

“An age of glory in ancient times!” Luo Tian sighed. Epoch Lords roamed freely, and many who had lived through a second life were numerous. Yet why did it all turn to this?

“Enough chit-chat!” Before Luo Tian could speak further, the voices of eight peak elders echoed from within the array. They controlled blood-red figures, wielding scythes that slashed toward Luo Tian and Man Hun.

“You take them or I will?” Luo Tian smiled, watching the blood-red scythes approach. He addressed Man Hun.

Though the scythes radiated terrifying power, their aura was nothing compared to what he had faced with two Huangquan messengers. They were barely a threat—more of a bluff. Even if they could threaten an Epoch Lord, they couldn’t kill Luo Tian and Man Hun.

“I’ll do it!” Man Hun’s face lit up with eagerness, eager to show off before Luo Tian.

“Seems you’ve no chance,” but before Man Hun could move, a black lightning bolt shot from Luo Tian’s front. It howled as it flew.

“Roar…” The black figure expanded, six silver eyes glowing with cold light. A massive three-headed dog blocked Luo Tian and Man Hun’s view.

“What…” Man Hun gaped, stunned. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have such a powerful ally. Even when he had been wounded in the Man clan, Luo Tian hadn’t revealed this beast.

As Man Hun marveled, the three-headed dog appeared before the blood-red scythes. Facing a weapon capable of wounding an Epoch Lord, the three heads displayed greedy glares, drool dripping from their blood-red mouths.

“Roar…” The three heads howled, sending a ferocious aura through the heavens and earth. It made Luo Tian and Man Hun’s ears ring.

But what shocked them more was that the blood-red scythes emitted a humming sound in front of the three-headed dog.

A powerful suction arose from the beast’s mouth. In an instant, the blood-red scythe twisted and softened, then was sucked into the three-headed dog’s maw.

“Is this even possible?” Man Hun gaped, his mouth wide open in disbelief as he watched the ferocious three-headed dog.

“Impossible!” The nearly ten million people of the Heaven-Defying Alliance also stared in disbelief, watching their confident blood-red scythes devoured by the three-headed dog.

“Roar…” The three-headed dog roared again, its gaze turning to the blood-red illusion. The alliance members’ faces turned pale.

The suction intensified, targeting the blood-red figure. The three-headed dog lunged forward, devouring it hungrily.

“Buzz…” The hum echoed. Nearly ten million people trembled violently, feeling the power within the blood-red illusion being drained rapidly. Panic surged through them—this array had been sustaining them, and if it continued, they would be drained too.

“Break!” The eight peak elders could no longer bear the loss of power. They shouted at the crowd.

“Buzz…” Under the eight elders’ command, nearly ten million people quickly dispersed from the blood-red illusion.

The three-headed dog devoured the illusion hungrily, its body glistening black. It then turned its gaze to the Heaven-Defying Alliance members, growling with anger.

“It’s strength has increased! What kind of beast is this?” Man Hun stared at the three-headed dog, his face filled with fear. He turned to Luo Tian.

“Hell Three-Headed Dog!” Luo Tian whispered, surprised by the unexpected gain. He could sense a slight increase in the beast’s strength.

“What feeds on that aura? And what connection does it have with the mysterious hell?” Luo Tian pondered, his gaze fixed on the beast’s overwhelming aura.

The roar echoed again, as if angered by the Heaven-Defying Alliance. The three heads howled fiercely.

Ice, poison, and fire erupted from the beast’s mouths, spreading rapidly. In moments, the entire Star Palace was engulfed in a thousand-mile radius.

“Ah…” A scream echoed through the heavens. Though their array was powerful, without its support, these people were no more than strong ants before the three-headed dog. Even Luo Tian struggled against the poison, fire, and ice—how could they withstand it?

In an instant, Star Palace turned into a hellish realm. All below the Epoch level were wiped out by the three-headed dog, causing Man Hun’s face to twitch.

“Truly strong. You’ve killed so many with just one move. This dog is a meat grinder in group battles. When the war begins, make sure it doesn’t harm our Man clan!” Man Hun warned Luo Tian, his tone grave.

“Leave it to me,” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the desperate Heaven-Defying Alliance members.

“Perhaps it’s fate. Their alliance leader and the Epoch Lords’ offspring aren’t here; otherwise, they might have been a tough opponent,” Luo Tian sighed softly. His gaze then turned to the Star Palace, still standing amidst the chaos.

“Let’s go. Let’s see what strange phenomena Star River Mansion holds.”

“Xiaohei, find us later!” Luo Tian addressed Man Hun and the three-headed dog before darting toward Star Palace.

Chapter 1700: The Ancient Path of the Stars

Luo Tian and Man Hun rushed into Star Palace. The vast hall was eerily empty, devoid of life. A chilling atmosphere pervaded the place.

“Star Palace… it shouldn’t be like this, right?” Luo Tian murmured as he and Man Hun walked down the long corridor. The steps on either side were lined with rooms of various sizes, likely where Star Palace’s former residents had lived.

“Creak…” They pushed open a door and found another scene—like an independently created space with courtyards, rooms, everything one could imagine.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian sighed softly. He felt the aura within this room was stronger than outside, confirming his guess. The courtyard looked abandoned.

No surprises found, they exited the room and continued up the endless corridor.

This time, they didn’t enter the side rooms but sped forward, reaching the top in an instant.

“Buzz…” A ripple rose. Luo Tian and Man Hun appeared on a vast platform, gazing at the boundless stars.

“Beautiful!” Man Hun marveled at the stars as if within reach, his face momentarily stunned.

“Unfortunately, Star Palace was destroyed. Otherwise, I could have brought my wives here to watch the stars and moon,” Luo Tian mused before scanning the platform.

“After all this, how do we enter Star River Mansion?” Man Hun asked, confusion etched on his face.

“I don’t know either,” Luo Tian shrugged. He scanned the surroundings but found no clues.

“Damn it, what do we do? We didn’t come for nothing! This place is really hard to find. Didn’t Star Palace have an ancient path leading to Star River Mansion?” Man Hun grew impatient.

“Don’t panic. Let’s look for clues. Though this platform is vast, it’s not too big for us,” Luo Tian smiled and continued scanning.

“I hate thinking. You do it!” Man Hun waved his hand, then lounged on a table like a lord.

“Buzz…” As soon as Man Hun lay down, the stone table beneath him emitted a humming sound and sank into the ground.

“Damn it…” Man Hun cursed, then quickly stepped back.

“Creak… creak…” The platform’s decorations all made noise, sinking into the ground. Glowing stars rose, illuminating the central spot.

“Probably there,” Luo Tian smiled. “I feel a transmission ripple here.”

“I’m a genius! I cracked this complex thing so quickly!” Man Hun grinned, stepping into the starlit spot.

“Buzz…” A ripple spread. In an instant, Man Hun vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Truly found by luck!” Luo Tian smiled and stepped into the starlit spot as well.

A familiar ripple enveloped Luo Tian, and he vanished from the platform.

Dizziness overtook him. A faint smile tugged at Luo Tian’s lips. He still had a shadowy memory of transmission arrays, having experienced them many times before. Even now as an Epoch Lord, he felt uneasy.

“Where am I?” As the dizziness faded, Luo Tian steadied himself and cautiously surveyed his surroundings.

Star rivers hung overhead. Stars glowed beneath his feet, a dazzling river stretching into the unknown.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian marveled, a violent ripple surged through his perception.

He looked up. A towering figure stood on the star river, clashing with another stone giant. Though the latter was clumsy, it radiated a powerful aura.

“Man Hun?” Luo Tian instantly recognized the figure—Man Hun had arrived before him.

“Luo Tian, help! This giant is tough!” Man Hun called out as he saw Luo Tian.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian闪身, appearing beside Man Hun. He threw a punch at the stone giant’s body.

“Boom…” The impact sent Luo Tian stumbling back, his face grim. He hadn’t expected this seemingly ordinary stone giant to be so resilient.

“Don’t underestimate it! This thing is tough!” Man Hun warned, throwing a punch and retreating to Luo Tian’s side. His hands were numb.

“Any strange features?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light, scanning the stone giant charging at them.

“Hold on. I’ll check why it’s so strong!” Luo Tian retreated, disappearing from Man Hun’s sight.

“You bastard! You’re ditching me!” Man Hun cursed. But before he could finish, the stone giant reached him, clumsily throwing a punch.

Man Hun had no choice but to curse and fight the stone giant again. The collision echoed through the starry void.

Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with violet light, fixated on the stone giant clashing with Man Hun but showing no injuries.

“A thread of immortal aura!” He saw the stone giant’s body, glowing with green light. His face showed shock.

Within the stone giant’s massive form, a current of opportunity flowed like meridians. It was no wonder he felt wary.

“This is good!” Luo Tian smiled, recalling how three threads of immortal aura had nearly killed a Man clan lord.

“Who crafted this? Using immortal aura to animate an ordinary stone giant!” Luo Tian’s mind was in turmoil.

“Is this the ancient path leading to Star River Mansion?” Luo Tian gazed at the endless star river. He wondered what dangers awaited at its end and how his friends were faring.

“Need to act quickly!” Luo Tian sighed, then dashed toward the stone giant again, throwing another punch.

With Luo Tian’s help, Man Hun felt relief. But the stone giant was unusually tough; their attacks only chipped it slightly, failing to destroy it.

“Tough opponent!” Man Hun sighed. They hadn’t even seen Star River Mansion yet, and already faced a stone giant with a thread of immortal aura. What else awaited them? Would they meet immortals?

“Think of a plan! We can’t keep this up forever. How long will it take to wear this thing down?” Man Hun threw another punch, addressing Luo Tian.

“Boom…” As Man Hun’s words ended, a thunderous roar echoed through the stars. Several stars rose slowly, glowing with green light.

The massive stars radiated powerful auras, each capable of killing an Epoch peak.

“Your mother! So many! Even those who lived through a second life would die!” Man Hun’s face turned from excitement to fear.

“Don’t panic! Run!” Luo Tian shouted, using the stone giant’s shock to flee.

“You’re so unscrupulous!” Man Hun cursed, but before he could finish, the stone giants chased after them.

Luo Tian and Man Hun, though confident, weren’t fool enough to fight. They fled with all their might.

“Buzz…” As they flew, a ripple rose behind them. The nine threads of immortal aura didn’t pursue them but entered the rising stars.

The nine stars glowed brilliantly. Under Luo Tian’s watchful gaze, they transformed into stone giants, joining the one clashing with them. They all rushed toward Luo Tian and Man Hun.

“Ten… ten…” Man Hun stammered. It was no longer about wearing down the stone giant but whether he and Luo Tian could survive against ten of them.

Chapter 1701: Extracting Immortal Aura

Ten stone giants radiated terrifying auras, chasing Luo Tian and Man Hun. Though clumsy, their speed was enough to keep the two on edge. They dodged and weaved through this unknown world, evading capture.

“Luo Tian, think of a plan! These things have no end. We can’t keep running forever!” Man Hun ran, shouting.

“Fool! If I had a plan, why would these mindless things chase us like mice?” Luo Tian shouted back but thought furiously.

“Master…” Just as Luo Tian was at a loss, a mental message reached him. The voice was muffled but clear.

“I can help!” The soul of the Rip Heaven Spear echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, bringing a smile to his face.

“Buzz…” Thinking of this, Luo Tian stopped abruptly. A golden spear appeared in his hand and flipped.

The reverse spear technique—common among humans. Now, Luo Tian executed it effortlessly, making Man Hun’s eyes blur.

Retreating and turning the spear—each movement was fluid. The golden spear pierced the nearest stone giant.

“Sizzle…” Sparks flew as the spear entered the stone giant’s body. Man Hun was stunned.

“This spear is amazing!” Man Hun murmured, watching the Rip Heaven Spear. He had fought against that stone giant and knew its defense was absurdly strong. Yet the Rip Heaven Spear, still a nascent Epoch Treasure, hadn’t even grown its soul yet.

The stone giant’s defense was pierced by the spear with only a slight hesitation.

“Buzz…” A humming sound echoed within the stone giant’s body, disrupting its immortal aura. The giant froze mid-air.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian defeated one stone giant, the remaining nine closed in. Nine fists glowing with green light surrounded him, leaving no escape.

“Damn it! Man Hun, what are you staring at? Let me get smashed!” Luo Tian shouted at Man Hun, who was still admiring the spear. The golden Wheel of Reincarnation hummed, channeling most of its Epoch power to his back. He pulled the spear and stabbed it into a stone giant’s body while throwing a punch at another.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s back was struck by four stone giants, the sound of cracks echoing. He felt as if hit by four mountains, blood spewing from his mouth. Man Hun appeared in front of him, blocking three stone giants at the cost of his chest collapsing.

Luo Tian and Man Hun escaped from the nine stone giants’包围, but at a heavy cost. Two of them were disabled, floating in the star river. Immortal aura spilled from their wounds.

“That’s immortal aura! Such a good resource, wasted. If we refined it, our martial arts would become earth-shattering!” Man Hun looked on with regret, longing to refine every thread of aura into his body.

“Damn it! If we miss this chance, heaven itself would be unjust!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, suppressing the rising qi. He wiped blood from his mouth, feeling cracks in his back. The four stone giants had shattered it, but it quickly regenerated.

“Man Hun, dare you gamble with me? If we succeed, we can finish the rest of these guys at once!” Luo Tian shouted while fleeing.

“Say it! Unless you want me dead, I’ll agree to anything!” Man Hun nodded firmly.

“Fool! You think I want to possess you?”

“Listen. To finish the remaining eight stone giants at once, there’s only one way—get them in a straight line. I’ll fully activate the Rip Heaven Spear and pierce all eight at once!” Luo Tian’s voice reached Man Hun, who stiffened.

“Piercing so many at once? How can you do it? And how will you get these giants in a straight line?” Man Hun shook his head.

“How to pierce is my problem. What you need to do is attract these eight giants into a line!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Man Hun.

“Fool! How can I do that?” Man Hun’s face showed reluctance, shouting back.

“Want a big opportunity?!” Luo Tian smiled and kicked Man Hun’s massive body, sending him flying toward the eight stone giants.

“Damn it! Luo Tian, you bastard! I’ll never forgive you!” Man Hun cursed as he flew.

“Boom…” Man Hun clearly used his full strength. In front of immortal aura, no one could remain indifferent—Man Hun was no exception.

The collision sent two massive bodies flying back. Man Hun roared, ignoring the stone giants he had knocked back and charging toward another. He avoided direct confrontation, knowing eight giants would reduce him to dust.

Man Hun led the eight stone giants in a circle while Luo Tian watched closely for an opportunity. Though Man Hun was far more agile, he occasionally clashed with the stone giants, making him suffer.

“Luo Tian, it’s not working! I’m almost done!” Man Hun howled, his bones broken. He was running from the stone giants.

“It’s ready!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light. The Rip Heaven Spear glowed with ten thousand lights, and his Epoch power surged into it.

“Spear Master of the Heavens!” A streak of light flashed. Luo Tian roared and vanished from his spot.

“Only one chance!” Luo Tian’s heart pounded. As he appeared before the first stone giant, the others instantly formed a straight line.

“Plop…” Stone chips fell. The Rip Heaven Spear, for the first time fully activated by Luo Tian, pierced through the stone giant’s body.

“One… two…” The golden spear repeatedly pierced each stone giant, making Man Hun’s face light up with excitement.

After one strike, all eight stone giants froze in place. Luo Tian exhaled deeply.

“Truly amazing!” Man Hun marveled at the eight massive stone giants, gazing at the Rip Heaven Spear. Few Epoch Treasures could achieve this.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed. Next, the golden spear emitted a suction, drawing out the aura from the stone giants’ bodies.

“Damn it! You want to eat all this alone?” Man Hun cursed, dragging his injured body toward a stone giant and pressing his hand against it. He activated his martial arts, beginning to refine the aura.

“Finally some peace!” Luo Tian ignored the Rip Heaven Spear’s absorption and approached another massive stone giant, sitting on its head to absorb the aura that made anyone greedy.

Time passed slowly. Though their martial arts were extraordinary, absorbing foreign aura from the Nine Realms was slow. It took seven days to fully refine it. Each of them absorbed three, while the Rip Heaven Spear absorbed four—far faster than them.

“You really aren’t ordinary,” Man Hun said, his face serious. He felt the immense pressure from the Rip Heaven Spear.

“With immortal aura nurturing it, even its soul is just forming. It might evolve into an Immortal Treasure someday!” Man Hun said, envy in his voice.

“Possibly,” Luo Tian shook his head. Immortal aura was hard to obtain unless one ascended to the Immortal Realm.

Still, Luo Tian could feel the Rip Heaven Spear had become stronger. It was now comparable to the Ancient Epoch Palace.

“Haha, I really hope there’s more immortal aura. If we refine it, maybe we can become immortals!” Man Hun smiled, feeling a thick thread of immortal aura in his body—refined from three stone giants.

“You were right, Sa Man. This is a big opportunity!” Man Hun smiled, surprised they had refined three immortal auras so quickly. Though not many, it was still an impressive method.

“If there were more, we could even kill those who lived through a second life!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with admiration. He felt the immortal aura in his dantian was nearly as strong as the pill he had refined in the Immortal Coffin. Though it could wound an Epoch Lord, it was now clearly insufficient.

Chapter 1702: Entering Star River Mansion

“Buzz…” The humming echoed as Luo Tian’s words ended. Another wave of sound rose from him and Man Hun.

“More!” Hearing the humming, both men’s eyes lit up. They hadn’t expected more stone giants.

“Great! Great!” Man Hun grinned, forgetting his earlier chase by the stone giants.

“Familiar vibrations. Familiar scent!” Man Hun looked at the rising stars and glowing light, excitement in his eyes.

“Huh?” Though Luo Tian was also excited, he remained alert. His eyes widened in fear as a massive pressure descended upon him and Man Hun.

“One… ten… one hundred…” A hundred massive stars rose from the star river. Each radiated an aura capable of killing an Epoch peak.

“Your mother! So many! Even those who lived through a second life would die!” Man Hun’s face turned from excitement to fear.

“Don’t panic! Run!” Luo Tian shouted, increasing his speed as he merged with the immortal aura flowing through the stars.

“Wait for me!” Man Hun took a step, flying behind Luo Tian toward the star river’s end.

They pushed their speed to the limit. The pressure from behind made them wish for more legs.

No resistance was possible. Ten stone giants had already left them battered, and a hundred were no match for their will.

As they ran, more stone giants formed behind them, chasing into the star river’s depths.

“Your mother! What is this place? Everyone who comes here dies!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, even he was fed up.

“Only Epoch Lords could withstand it,” Man Hun said. Their speed was fast, but the stone giants were slightly slower, yet still followed closely, making them sweat.

Still, they felt relieved. No more immortal aura flowed from the star river. If it did, they would be caught between two forces and have no chance of survival.

“What is that?” After flying for a day, the stone giants gradually fell behind.

A day was enough to cross two starfields in the Nine Realms, but this star river had no end.

Yet they weren’t without gains. They finally spotted a strong golden light—a massive golden mansion occupying half the starscape, appearing in their view. Their eyes lit up.

Mist surrounded the mansion, resembling an immortal’s abode. Its aura was overwhelming. Though distant, it pressed upon them with immense pressure.

“Star River Mansion!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up. No need to guess—it was the legendary place, Star River Mansion.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian smiled, rushing toward the mansion. There was no other path now; a hundred stone giants chased them.

They flew toward Star River Mansion. Though it seemed near, they took nearly half a day to reach its grand entrance, eyes filled with awe.

The massive mansion glowed with golden light. Surrounding it was a sea of immortal aura—countless threads, wrapping the mansion like an invincible defense.

Seeing this, Luo Tian finally understood where the immortal aura within the stars came from.

“Are we breaking in? I feel this gate is harder than those stone giants. Even the immortal aura here can’t be breached!” Man Hun trembled, staring at the surrounding immortal aura. It felt like the best protection.

“Boom…” As they pondered, the hundred stone giants roared toward them, shaking the stars.

“What now? We can’t enter this gate, and those stone giants are after us!” Man Hun was confused, looking at Luo Tian.

“Break the gate. Follow me!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and dashed toward Star River Mansion’s gate without hesitation.

No choice. Time was tight, so he thought of this simple method.
