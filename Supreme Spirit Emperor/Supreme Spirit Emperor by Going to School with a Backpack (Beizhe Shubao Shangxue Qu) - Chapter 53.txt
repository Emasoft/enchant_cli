Looking at Shui Yuaji's corpse and the injured middle-aged man, Wang Pengtian did not recognize Shui Yuaji but recognized the middle-aged man—Wang Lechang, son of his chief steward Wang Decai.

Wang Pengtian mentally cursed Wang Lechang's lack of eyesight, his face carrying a smile as he spoke softly: "Luo elder brother, please come inside. Let's talk about it calmly. If my Wang family offended you, I'll certainly make amends!"

The middle-aged man who had been repelled by Luo Tian just recovered slightly when he saw Wang Pengtian smiling at Luo Tian. His face showed great alarm.

When he heard Luo Tian's name, his face seemed to have eaten excrement, despair flooding his heart.

Luo Tian's great name was naturally known to him—a figure he had to look up to. Though he had heard of it, at that time he was only at the Body-Refining Third Stage and hadn't had the chance to attend major affairs of the Wang family, nor had he truly met Luo Tian.

Other members of the Wang family looked at Wang Lechang with a touch of sympathy, knowing that no matter how it was resolved, Wang Lechang would not come out unscathed.

Luo Tian's name had become a monument in Tianyuan City, still unmatched to this day. He had destroyed the Li family and trampled the Feiyun Sect. Those who hadn't seen Luo Tian before could never imagine these great deeds were all accomplished by this young man in his early twenties.

"Old Brother Wang, no need for that. Let's settle this here. Here's the situation..." Seeing Wang Pengtian's attitude, Luo Tian knew he was unaware of anything and recounted the entire incident.

After listening to Luo Tian's account, Wang Pengtian's face showed a flicker of anger. Though a small town was nothing to the Wang family, once tied to Luo Tian, it became a major issue.

Looking at the injured Wang Lechang, Wang Pengtian understood. He knew that Wang Decai and his son had been secretly moving against him, but due to Wang Decai's long years of service, he hadn't interfered much. He hadn't expected that even a distant relative of Wang Decai's would dare to seize men and women in a small town.

"Old Master Wang!" Wang Pengtian roared, his gaze sweeping toward the elderly man in the crowd who was treating Wang Lechang.

Hearing Wang Pengtian call him, Wang Decai's heart trembled, his face filled with fear as he stepped out of the crowd.

"You and your son are truly... ha, I'm so disappointed!" Wang Pengtian's face showed disappointment.

"Master, this... this..." Wang Decai's face was drenched in cold sweat, his heart wanting to explain.

"What is this? I let you manage the Wang family, and your distant relative dares to seize men and women. Then what about you two? Do you think you've ascended to the heavens?" Wang Pengtian didn't let Wang Decai explain and struck him with a palm.

Though Wang Decai was at the Body-Refining Fifth Stage, he couldn't withstand Wang Pengtian's furious strike.

Wang Decai's face was filled with terror. These months, the Wang family had become the first power in Tianyuan City. They too had indeed inflated a bit, and with Wang Pengtian's recent seclusion, he had also done many things of seizing men and women.

Though Wang Decai wanted to explain, he didn't know how to argue back, his face showing fear and only continuously begging for mercy.

"Luo elder brother, this matter?" Luo Tian didn't want to listen to Wang Decai's chatter anymore, his face dark as he looked at Wang Pengtian, waiting for his next move.

"Luo elder brother, don't worry. I'll investigate this thoroughly. My Wang family also needs a cleansing to prevent the remaining people from becoming too arrogant!" Wang Pengtian's face was filled with anger as he strode toward Wang Decai and struck him with a palm.

Wang Decai's brain splattered, his eyes filled with resentment as he fell down.

After killing Wang Decai, Wang Pengtian stepped toward Wang Lechang again and struck him down with a palm. Turning back, his eyes cold as he looked at the Wang family members: "Find them! Anyone connected to these two, find them and kill them without question!"

"Luo elder brother, are you satisfied with this?" Wang Pengtian turned back to Luo Tian, his gaze solemn.

Seeing Wang Pengtian's actions, Luo Tian nodded slowly: "Thank you, Old Brother!"

"It should be me who thanks you. This has also sounded a warning for my Wang family. If it had been someone with an odd temperament, I'm sure my Wang family would have been implicated!" Wang Pengtian said with emotion.

Ning Yueri had been watching Luo Tian all along. When Wang Pengtian and the others came out, Ning Yueri felt a sense of despair. She had barely escaped from the Li family with Gu's help, and at that time, even now, the heads of the Gu and Wang families were like gods to her.

But she hadn't expected that this god-like figure would be so respectful toward Luo Tian, showing no arrogance at all, even appearing somewhat reverent.

"Buzz..." A fluctuation of primordial qi spread as Luo Tian took out the jade token at his waist, his eyes slightly changing.

"Old Brother Wang, I have another matter to trouble you with!" Luo Tian put the jade token away, his face solemn as he spoke.

"Don't be so formal, elder brother. Just say it. If I can help, I'll do my best!" Wang Pengtian was eager for Luo Tian to owe him a favor, so he accepted.

"Trouble you, Old Brother Wang, please take care of this girl and bring her mother over to take care of her for a while. I have urgent matters and need to return to the sect. Once I finish my affairs, I'll come back for them!" Luo Tian explained his intention.

Hearing that Luo Tian needed to return to the sect, Wang Pengtian's face showed a flicker of surprise. He nodded: "Luo elder brother, rest assured. I'll send someone to fetch the girl's mother right away. Rest assured, with my Wang family here, this girl will be safe!"

Ning Yueri heard Luo Tian's words and her eyes flashed with a touch of reluctance. She didn't know how long Luo Tian would be gone, but she knew he must have very important matters to attend to. Just by seeing Wang Pengtian's attitude toward Luo Tian, she understood that Luo Tian's identity was definitely not ordinary. Thinking of herself as just a mountain girl, a faint sense of inferiority filled Ning Yueri's heart.

Chapter 257: The Washing Spirit Pool Opens

"Take care of yourself well, and I'll come back to fetch you and your mother once I finish my business!" Luo Tian gently patted Ning Yueri's head, his face showing a touch of indulgence as he interrupted her wandering thoughts.

"Yes!" Seeing Luo Tian's gentle gaze, Ning Yueri nodded obediently.

"Roar..." Baihu roared and appeared before Luo Tian. Ignoring the startled gazes of everyone, Luo Tian mounted Baihu and bowed to Wang Pengtian before disappearing from the sight of the Wang family members.

"What kind of fierce beast is that tiger? It made me feel like wanting to kneel!" A young disciple of the Wang family whispered.

Others hearing the youth's words nodded with lingering fear, even the patriarch Wang Pengtian looked at Luo Tian's distant figure with admiration. He realized that each time he saw Luo Tian, the latter surprised him again, and each time his strength had increased.

"Master Wang, can you tell me about Luo elder brother's story?" Ning Yueri looked at Wang Pengtian standing on the steps, her face filled with tension as she asked softly.

Wang Pengtian was still admiring Luo Tian's increased strength when he heard her voice. He didn't ask what Ning Yueri was doing, his face showing a smile: "This lady, Luo elder brother entrusted me to take care of you. Please follow me into the courtyard first. I'll tell you about Luo Tian's story later. I'll send someone to fetch your mother as well."

"Yes!" Feeling Wang Pengtian's kind gaze, Ning Yueri followed him into the courtyard of the Wang family under the envious glances of the Wang family members.

...

At that moment, Luo Tian and Baihu were galloping on the main road, his face showing urgency as he constantly signaled Baihu to speed up.

Luo Tian's time was really tight. The jade token at his waist had just emitted Zhang Ziping's voice, urging him to return quickly because the Washing Spirit Pool would only open for one more day. Yet he was still in Tianyuan City.

Fortunately, Baihu was there; otherwise, with just his legs, he wouldn't have been able to return to the sect in such a short time.

Baihu rushed like a white lightning across the road, and what would have taken Luo Tian four or five days was completed in one day, bringing him to the foot of the Five Elements Sect.

Seeing the towering peaks of the Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian felt a sense of returning home.

He strode into the Five Elements Sect and headed toward the Dan Pavilion. To Luo Tian's surprise, the sect was unusually quiet.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly. Though people were walking around, most were outer sect disciples. He wasn't very familiar with these outer sect disciples, but they mostly recognized Luo Tian—after all, when he first joined the Five Elements Sect, his name was renowned.

Seeing Luo Tian riding a white tiger back, they showed surprise and respectfully greeted him.

Luo Tian smiled and responded to them lightly. He stored Baihu in his Nal Ling Bag, his mind filled with questions as he headed toward Zhang Ziping's residence.

Upon entering the Dan Pavilion, Luo Tian also noticed that it was slightly quieter than the main hall. Though the number of people hadn't decreased much, some familiar faces were missing from the Dan Pavilion.

He greeted everyone briefly and headed toward Zhang Ziping's residence. At that moment, Zhang Ziping was sitting in his room, and upon seeing Luo Tian arrive, he showed a flicker of joy as he sighed: "You're back?"

"Yes, elder brother. I noticed the Five Elements Sect has fewer people now. Even the Dan Pavilion is quieter. Where are Second Elder Brother and Third Elder Brother?" Luo Tian asked after seeing Zhang Ziping.

"Ah... I suppose you've already heard, right? The Tianshi Sect has appeared in the Northern Region. Now the major sects of the Northern Region are uniting to suppress the Tianshi Sect. As the top open sect in the Northern Region, the Five Elements Sect naturally has to send people out. That's why it's so quiet now!" Zhang Ziping explained.

"So Second Elder Brother and Third Elder Brother also went out, right?" Luo Tian's face showed a touch of concern. He hadn't expected the Tianshi Sect to have caused such tension in the Northern Region, even prompting major sects to unite against it. Luo Tian couldn't help but worry about his two elder brothers.

"Don't worry, I heard that the Tianshi Sect's leader is only at the Bone-Subjugation Stage. So far, no one has discovered an Elder Soul Stage master. If there were, the major sects would have sent their Elder Soul Stage masters to eliminate them. After all, even if an Elder Soul Stage master is dispatched, it's still possible for the Tianshi Sect's Elder Soul Stage master to escape. Only when a Reincarnation Stage master, who is a sect's core strength, would they be dispatched."

Hearing Zhang Ziping's words, Luo Tian felt reassured. The current situation was beyond his ability as a mere Body-Refining Ninth Stage master to influence.

"Come on, the Washing Spirit Pool is about to open. Let's see if you can enter the Bone-Subjugation Stage first. If you can, it'll be a safeguard in this chaotic era! I'm sure entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage won't be a problem for you. If you enter the Bone-Subjugation Stage, even if others are at the initial stage of Bone-Subjugation, they won't be your match!" Zhang Ziping spoke softly, his eyes filled with hope. He wanted to see how strong the rare Five Elements Body would be once it entered the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

Luo Tian nodded lightly. At that moment, his primordial qi droplets in the丹田 were almost entirely filled, needing just a bit more cultivation to choose whether to break through into the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

As they walked and talked, Luo Tian also recounted his experiences to Zhang Ziping, including sending Lu Kunpeng to escort Leng Qiuchan to Feiyang City.

Zhang Ziping listened carefully. When he heard about Lu Kunpeng escorting Leng Qiuchan to Feiyang City, his eyes flashed with concern. However, thinking of Lu Kunpeng's steadiness, his expression quickly returned to calmness.

As they walked under the respectful gazes of others, they finally arrived at a modest peak on the back mountain. Though the peak seemed unremarkable, Luo Tian could clearly feel that its primordial qi was far stronger than other peaks. Moreover, he knew there were several terrifying fluctuations巡视ing the peak.

They walked forward together and finally stopped at the entrance of a large hall. At that moment, many people were standing outside the hall—disciples from various peaks, elders, and even some peak masters stood outside the hall, their eyes filled with anticipation as they looked into the hall.

"Finally here!"
Zhang Ziping turned to Luo Tian, his eyes showing a smile.

"Finally here! I suppose everyone else has already entered!" Luo Tian also showed a sense of admiration, speaking softly.

Chapter 258: Entering the Washing Spirit Pool

"Luo Tian!" Someone shouted loudly, drawing everyone's attention to Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping.

"Hmph, you're so late, yet still have the face to come in?" Huang Jingshan, the master of Thick Earth Peak, saw Zhang Ziping and Luo Tian approaching and mocked.

"Go away..." Zhang Ziping was too tired to bother with Huang Jingshan, he coldly snorted.

While people were observing Luo Tian, Luo Tian was also observing others and didn't see Feng Qianyu or Zhang Hongyun's figures, so he knew they might have already entered.

He also didn't see the masters of Tiandu Peak and Qingmu Peak, only the masters of Thick Earth Peak and Jinguang Peak were present.

"The other peak masters have gone out to find the Tianshi Sect's movements, and these peaks' masters are rotating to stay in the Five Elements Sect to prevent any unexpected incidents," seeing Luo Tian's puzzled expression, Zhang Ziping explained.

"What about Master Tian?" Luo Tian didn't rush into the Washing Spirit Pool immediately but asked about Master Tian's situation.

Hearing Luo Tian ask about Master Tian, Zhang Ziping showed a smile: "Master Tian has gone out on my behalf. Otherwise, the Dan Pavilion would truly have no one to oversee!"

"By the way, after you come out, go to Gu's family. I believe you'll have some surprises!" Zhang Ziping said, thinking of the recent good news at Gu's family, his face showing a mysterious expression.

Luo Tian nodded, looking at Zhang Ziping's mysterious gaze with confusion, but he could tell it was something good. Obviously, if he asked further, Zhang Ziping wouldn't say anything. He bowed to the surrounding disciples and said softly: "Then I'll go in first!"

"Go on. This is an Advanced Grade Xuan-level technique. You can use it inside. If the techniques aren't good enough, you'll be at a disadvantage," Zhang Ziping said and handed Luo Tian a jade slip.

"Hmph, what's the use of learning techniques now? You might have already been outdone by others who took all the primordial qi in there!" Huang Jingshan sarcastically criticized.

The surrounding Five Elements Sect disciples, seeing Zhang Ziping only now giving Luo Tian the technique, showed strange expressions. Though some hadn't entered the Washing Spirit Pool before, they knew that better techniques inside would bring more benefits.

But giving Luo Tian the technique now clearly meant he was learning it on the spot, which would be unrealistic to compete with others inside.

Luo Tian smiled and shook his head. Though he didn't know what level the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique was, he knew it was most adept at absorbing and refining. Otherwise, after consuming so many high-level elixirs, he would have already exploded without the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique.

He gently pushed back Zhang Ziping's technique and smiled: "I have my own technique, elder brother. Don't worry!"

Seeing Luo Tian push back the Advanced Grade Xuan-level technique, the surrounding people showed strange expressions. An Advanced Grade Xuan-level technique—so it was useless to use it, obviously Luo Tian was very confident in his own technique. So what level was Luo Tian's technique? At least Earth-level!

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zhang Ziping didn't insist and smiled, taking back the technique and indicating that Luo Tian could enter. If he was late, it might have already been emptied by the others inside.

Luo Tian smiled and ignored the surrounding people's comments, striding into the hall.

As soon as he entered the hall, Luo Tian was stunned. Where was this hall? It was clearly a cave, with strong and dense primordial qi rushing toward him, making him feel refreshed. Luo Tian could clearly sense the intensity of the primordial qi here had reached a terrifying level, even making him feel it was sticky.

Luo Tian walked forward slowly, and the sound of flowing water echoed in his ears. He looked toward the sound and saw a small pool ahead, which could accommodate several people.

At that moment, several young figures were seated in the pool, their eyes closed, emitting strong auras from their bodies.

Luo Tian looked at these young people and smiled. These weren't just anyone—Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun!

His spiritual sense spread out, and he could clearly feel that they were absorbing the nearly milky-white spring water's primordial qi fiercely.

"Really need to speed up, otherwise it might be taken by these guys!" Luo Tian sighed and jumped into the primordial qi pool.

It was strange that when Luo Tian jumped in, there were no splashes of water, only a slight ripple on the surface.

As soon as he sat down, Luo Tian started to circulate the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique, absorbing the primordial qi from this pool.

As soon as he started circulating the technique, Luo Tian's face showed a smile and opened his eyes to look at them: "Haha, competing? With me here, can you outcompete me?"

Luo Tian's eyes showed a touch of battle spirit. He closed his eyes again and started circulating the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique, absorbing the primordial qi from the pool at a speed several times faster than before.

"Ah?" Everyone felt a霸道 aura, like a whale drinking and swallowing, taking away most of the primordial qi from the pool. This made everyone open their eyes in surprise.

"Luo Tian!" Zhang Hongyun spoke, looking at Luo Tian. He had thought Luo Tian wouldn't make it in time but was surprised to see him return at this moment.

At that time, the others were also competing for the primordial qi in the pool, achieving a balance. When Luo Tian started circulating the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique, he hadn't absorbed any primordial qi. This made Luo Tian understand the rules of the Washing Spirit Pool: it was about who had the more霸道 technique, and whoever absorbed more primordial qi would gain greater benefits!

"He really did return after all!" Yang Huanyu's face showed a touch of admiration and didn't pay attention anymore, closing his eyes to continue competing for the absorption of primordial qi.

Feng Qianyu, for some reason, had a fierce scar on his handsome face and eyes filled with excitement: "Let me see how much the gap between us is now!"

Other disciples of the Five Elements Sect showed a touch of bitterness. Though they were elite students from various peaks, compared to these four people, they still lagged far behind. Moreover, most of them had been selected after the previous challenge by the Xuan Yin Sect, so they couldn't match these four. Still, they followed the principle of taking as much as possible and closed their eyes to circulate their techniques.

Chapter 259: Competition

In the Five Elements Sect's Washing Spirit Pool.

Other peak disciples, as soon as they sat down, opened their eyes again with a touch of bitterness because they had just sat down and found that the entire Washing Spirit Pool was basically occupied by these four people. They couldn't even get a share of the primordial qi.

Four thick whirlwinds formed around the four people, and they temporarily fell into a state of calm. However, the disciples who were pushed out knew this was just the beginning. They believed that after some time, there would be another competition because the primordial qi in the Washing Spirit Pool was limited and not endless.

Some young disciples, realizing they couldn't compete with these four people, were straightforward and walked out of the pool to discuss who had absorbed the most primordial qi.

"I guess it's Luo Tian, I feel he is the strongest in our generation at the Body-Refining Stage!" A disciple from Jinguang Peak said.

"Luo Tian is indeed terrifying, but this isn't about combat power but the霸道 of techniques. I think it would be Yang Senior Brother, since Thick Earth Peak's Dan Pavilion was sealed by the Dan Pavilion, and Yang Senior Brother still has such terrifying cultivation. It must be due to his technique's strength!" A disciple from Thick Earth Peak said softly, his eyes filled with fervor as he looked at Yang Huanyu.

"Actually, Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu's two senior brothers are also very strong. They both have dual-element bodies!" A disciple from Qingmu Peak said softly, as if recalling that there had been a dual-element body on Qingmu Peak before.

This disciple's words made a disciple from Tiandu Peak show admiration and sighed inwardly, thinking if Gu Lei were in Tiandu Peak, there would definitely be Gu Lei among those competing here.

While the disciples were discussing, the four people in the pool gradually became serious, their whirlwinds of primordial qi expanding continuously. Obviously, they weren't satisfied with the current state and were invading the whirlwinds of the remaining three.

The others couldn't let it go, continuously expanding their own whirlwinds of primordial qi.

At this moment, Luo Tian was very excited because he could clearly feel his dan tian's primordial qi continuously凝聚ing into droplets. One, two, they gathered in his dan tian.

But at this moment, Luo Tian could clearly feel three strong invading intentions coming toward him.

Luo Tian smiled coldly and collided with the four whirlwinds of primordial qi.

Water splashed everywhere, four whirlwinds of primordial qi continuously splashing water droplets into the air, turning into refined primordial qi.

"Look! It's started! They've finally begun to compete! Hehe, let's see who is more霸道 and who can enter the Bone-Subjugation Stage first!" A disciple shouted loudly.

Others heard this and nodded in agreement, clearly this was what they wanted to know. After all, the Washing Spirit Pool was prepared for these young disciples to break through into the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

These people had only absorbed some of the Washing Spirit Pool's primordial qi before Luo Tian entered, but for them, it was equivalent to a year of hard training. This made those who were about to break through into the Bone-Subjugation Stage sufficient, and they would surely break through soon after returning to their peaks.

Similarly, Feng Qianyu, Zhang Hongyun, and Luo Tian were the same. Now they were all on the brink of breaking through but didn't want to become ordinary Bone-Subjugation Stage disciples. They were all compressing their bodies' primordial qi intensity, but with the supplement of the Washing Spirit Pool, they had enough to break through into the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

"One hour... two hours..." The four people were engaged in another form of competition, obviously none wanted to lose to each other and fought desperately.

"These four little guys are quite interesting!" On the back mountain of this unremarkable peak, several people with a sense of沧桑 sat and looked at them with interest. These were the five peak masters who had come out when Xuan Yin Sect attacked.

"Ah, this boy named Luo Tian is indeed strong. I can feel his body's primordial qi intensity has reached a peak. If he doesn't break through, it will explode!" The old master of Qingmu Peak said with a light voice.

"The others should also be facing the same situation, right? These young people are really too competitive. Why not sit down and talk calmly?" The old master of Li Huo Peak said with a sigh.

"Haha, it's strange that you could say this from your mouth. Back when you were young, you were even more competitive than these little guys!" The old man from Shuiyue Peak said with a playful look, looking at the old master of Li Huo Peak.

The old men talked and laughed among themselves, but they also allocated part of their spiritual awareness to observe the young people, fearing something might happen to them.

"It can't go on like this!" Luo Tian felt some urgency, he could feel that his dan tian would be filled with primordial qi droplets after absorbing a little more, which meant he had to stop absorbing the Washing Spirit Pool's primordial qi. He felt reluctant about leaving the pool, especially since stopping meant surrendering to the three others, which Luo Tian could never do.

"Hmph! Compete with me in technique's霸道, give it to me!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth and circulated the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique while controlling the whirlwinds of primordial qi to fiercely attack the three others.

A single primordial qi dragon instantly thickened several times, roaring and biting into the three whirlwinds of primordial qi.

"Ugh... This is Luo Tian's technique? How霸道!" The people watching the scene exclaimed, looking at the dragon of primordial qi with shock.

The old peak masters who had been observing them also showed a touch of surprise. The old master of Qingmu Peak exclaimed: "What technique is this? It feels stronger than my Wanshu Shengsheng诀!"

The other peak masters nodded, they could feel the technique's complexity from Luo Tian's Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique.

At this moment, the battle between the four people was basically over. The three others fought desperately but couldn't match Luo Tian, who had transformed into a dragon. Their whirlwinds of primordial qi were torn apart by Luo Tian's primordial qi dragon.

After doing this, Luo Tian's face returned to normal and continued absorbing the primordial qi from the Washing Spirit Pool.

Yang Huanyu and Zhang Hongyun three people opened their eyes, a touch of bitterness in their eyes. They jumped out of the Washing Spirit Pool and didn't pay attention to the respectful gazes of several other peak disciples. They all closed their eyes and sat on the ground, showing a serious expression.

These disciples looked at them respectfully but also showed a touch of joy. After the three people came out, there was still quite a bit of primordial qi left in the Washing Spirit Pool. When Luo Tian came out, they still had a chance to pick up leftovers.

Chapter 260: Carving the Primordial Bones

With the departure of the three people, the Washing Spirit Pool now only had Luo Tian left. The entire pool was occupied by Luo Tian, who sat motionless like a statue in the pool with lowered water levels.

Feeling that the last gap in his dan tian was filled by the primordial qi droplets refined by the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique, Luo Tian's lips slightly curled: "Since it's filled, let's break through. I've been stuck at Body-Refining Ninth Stage for too long!"

"Crack..." Something seemed to break inside Luo Tian's body, and his entire aura suddenly rose. He returned to his previous cultivation level of Body-Refining Ninth Stage, but this time, his Body-Refining Ninth Stage state was far beyond what he had achieved when entering the Da'an Forest.

At this moment, as Luo Tian returned to Body-Refining Ninth Stage, his dan tian had also expanded significantly. His meridians were broader and more resilient. After being restructured by the Shu Ti Dan, Luo Tian's meridians were now more resilient than those of his peers at Body-Refining Ninth Stage, and the intensity of primordial qi he could withstand had reached a terrifying level.

"The elder brother, give us some left!" The other peak disciples by the pool's side had their mouths twitching as they watched Luo Tian, unsure what to say.

"Big brother, give us a little bit! Just a little and we'll be enough!" Their hearts continuously hoped Luo Tian would come out of the Washing Spirit Pool.

But could Luo Tian let go of such a good opportunity? He looked at the remaining one-fifth of the pool's water and smiled again: "This Washing Spirit Pool is really a good thing. I wonder if the remaining water can let me break through into Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage!"

Thinking of this, Luo Tian stopped thinking about anything else and closed his eyes again. He started circulating the Five Elements Primordial Energy Technique, absorbing the almost viscous primordial qi in the pool at a speed several times faster than before.

"Done!" The other peak disciples by the pool's edge, seeing Luo Tian's absorption speed was even more霸道 than before, showed a look of disappointment. At this moment, they knew that with Luo Tian's speed now, even if they all tried to stop him, it would be impossible.

Luo Tian didn't know what the people by the pool were thinking, but he kept absorbing the Washing Spirit Pool's primordial qi without competitors. He felt incredibly free, and droplets of primordial qi flowed again into his now significantly expanded dan tian.

As Luo Tian absorbed the Washing Spirit Pool's water endlessly, the three people on the pool's edge suddenly emitted terrifying fluctuations. This made their gazes return to the three of them.

"What is this?" A disciple saw the three people with red faces and showed a puzzled expression.

"These three little guys are good, they seem to be about to break through!" The five peak masters on the back mountain showed satisfied expressions.

"They are about to break through!" A disciple's eyes were filled with envy as he looked at them.

"Yes, this is the aura of breaking through! I've seen others break into Bone-Subjugation Stage before, but these three are clearly stronger than the one I saw!" Another disciple shouted loudly.

"Buzz..." A terrifying fluctuation of primordial qi spread from Feng Qianyu, and his body emitted a clear sound. Two long snakes of red and blue primordial qi circled around his body.

"No mistake, when entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage, there is a moment where primordial qi will naturally escape from the body!" A disciple shouted loudly, his face excited as he watched Feng Qianyu.

At this moment, Feng Qianyu's face was covered in sweat, and his body emitted continuous roaring sounds. The entire cave of the Washing Spirit Pool was filled with this roaring sound.

Feng Qianyu suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with a fierce look. He took a deep breath and sucked the two long snakes into his body.

After entering Feng Qianyu's body, the two long snakes rushed wildly, circling around his bones. It was as if they were searching for their homes.

Only three breaths, the two long snakes had searched Feng Qianyu's entire bones. For Feng Qianyu, these three breaths felt like three centuries.

The red primordial qi snake carried a scorching atmosphere, while the blue one carried an icy chill. They circled around his bones continuously. The pain was unimaginable, even with Feng Qianyu's strong willpower, it made him clench his teeth.

Finally, the red snake slowly moved to Feng Qianyu's palm. Feeling this situation, Feng Qianyu suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with excitement. He let out a low roar: "Primordial bones! Let them be carved!"

The red snake seemed to have a mind of its own. After Feng Qianyu's roar, it transformed into a primordial qi knife and carved on his entire palm.

"Zhi zhi..." A piercing sound echoed in the ears of several people.

Feng Qianyu could clearly feel how sharp the primordial qi knife was, and his white bone palm was constantly leaving mysterious imprints.

At the same time, the blue primordial qi also found its host and gathered on Feng Qianyu's chest, continuously carving.

Under the eyes of several disciples, Feng Qianyu's palm and chest constantly emitted red and blue light.

Feng Qianyu now felt a mysterious power gathering in his palm and chest. He couldn't describe this power, but he knew that once this ritual was completed, he would become much stronger. This was the Bone-Subjugation Stage that many Body-Refining Stage disciples stopped at for life!

"Truly amazing. Even the aura it emits is enough to make me feel shocked. If Feng Qianyu enters the Bone-Subjugation Stage, how strong would he be!" Several disciples looked at Feng Qianyu with deep respect.

At the same time, they cast their eyes over others, especially looking at Luo Tian in the Washing Spirit Pool. Their faces showed anticipation; they wanted to see what kind of commotion Luo Tian would make if he entered the Bone-Subjugation Stage. After all, Luo Tian was the legendary Five Elements Body!

But soon, their gazes returned to the three people. Because Zhang Hongyun's body was gradually filled with thick green and golden light, two long snakes appeared in front of him.

Zhang Hongyun opened his eyes and saw Feng Qianyu, drenched in sweat, and smiled. After the roaring sound in his body, he did the same as Feng Qianyu: took a deep breath and sucked the two long snakes into his mouth. The primordial qi snakes found their positions, and similarly transformed into primordial qi knives. However, Zhang Hongyun's golden primordial qi knife was positioned on his feet while the wooden one was on his palm.

Under the eyes of several disciples, Zhang Hongyun's body also made a "zhi zhi" sound.

Chapter 261: Simultaneous Advancement

"The two of them are both advancing!" Several disciples became excited. Seeing two geniuses advance at the same time was exciting for them, as they were now renowned in the Body-Refining Stage of the Five Elements Sect. Though Luo Tian had overshadowed them, they were still well-known throughout the sect.

Their gazes turned again to Yang Huanyu, hoping he would also advance simultaneously so they could boast when returning to their peaks.

Yang Huanyu didn't disappoint the disciples either. Under their expectant gazes, his body was filled with gray qi, and a gray long snake rose around him.

However, at the moment this gray long snake rose, the entire cave of the Washing Spirit Pool seemed to be filled with a violent and destructive aura.
