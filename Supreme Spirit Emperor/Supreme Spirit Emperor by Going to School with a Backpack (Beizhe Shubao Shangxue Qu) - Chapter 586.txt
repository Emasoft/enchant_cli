The affair had passed, and people once again discussed Luo Tian, but this time it was to criticize his shamelessness.

Faking an injury and robbing others of their merits—such a tactic had never been used by any previous Commander of Ten Thousand.

"Who do you think is the richest now? It must be Xue Zilong!" Luo Tian stood in his courtyard, murmuring to himself, his eyes once again filled with contemplation. Xue Zilong had gained considerable merits within seven days, and Luo Tian's ambitions were set on him. If he could obtain Xue Zilong's merits and combine them with the ghost-repelling pills he had cultivated over these days, Luo Tian was certain he could settle all his debts.

"Need to think of a way. Can't just snatch it outright!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, pacing in the courtyard.

"Ah! Just snatch it!" In an instant, Luo Tian's eyes lit up. He flipped his hand and took out a token, beginning to transmit thoughts to the others. When Luo Tian's voice fell, those who had followed Tianfu and now followed Luo Tian in the Eighth Legion received his transmission. Huo Zhen, Zhang Desheng and others also received Luo Tian's message, all feeling puzzled. The message contained only a few words: "Assemble at Xue Zilong's gate."

Though puzzled, the people did not defy Luo Tian's command. Especially Wang Chuan, Chang Teng and Sun Xinghua were particularly proactive because they knew they had offended Luo Tian. Only by responding enthusiastically to his orders could they ease the fire in Luo Tian's heart.

A Commander of Ten Thousand attempting to undermine a Captain was too easy.

Two ten-thousand troops instantly surrounded Xue Zilong's courtyard, faces filled with confusion. After Tianfu left, others also believed Luo Tian was injured and had no future, so many chose to leave or defect to other Commanders of Ten Thousand, or become free individuals. Luo Tian said nothing about it; after all, he would leave eventually. He knew that ensuring the remaining people was enough.

At this moment, Xue Zilong was repairing his courtyard. Over the past seven days, many had come to seek him out, adding to his original subordinates. There were about three or four thousand people.

"What's going on?" As the two ten-thousand troops surrounded the courtyard, those inside felt it immediately. Their eyes turned serious as they appeared outside the courtyard.

"Who dares to come here and cause trouble!" Xue Zilong's face darkened instantly. He had just become a Commander of Ten Thousand, and yet someone was coming to trouble him.

In an instant, Xue Zilong's body flickered and he appeared at the gate. His eyes looked toward Wang Chuan and others who had surrounded his courtyard.

"Want to die?" Xue Zilong roared, releasing a pressure of the peak of True Immortal. His eyes were cold as he looked at Wang Chuan and Sun Xinghua.

"We're just following orders. Once our leader arrives, you'll understand!" Wang Chuan shouted, looking at Xue Zilong. His heart was drumming constantly. However, Wang Chuan had already decided that Luo Tian's injury was fake. Luo Tian still had the power to kill Xue Zilong, so he needed to perform well to dispel Luo Tian's resentment.

"Luo Tian!" Xue Zilong's face darkened instantly. He naturally knew about Luo Tian's affairs, but he didn't understand why Luo Tian had ordered his courtyard surrounded.

Xue Zilong dared not attack Wang Chuan and others. He also feared Luo Tian, for he had almost died at Luo Tian's hands before.

The two groups stood in confrontation. Wang Chuan and others were stunned, while Xue Zilong was cautious and dared not attack.

As everyone waited, Luo Tian's iconic golden small carriage appeared in people's sight. Lei Yong and Ji Chen along with Ye Liangchen followed behind Luo Tian, walking to the front of the gate.

"Luo Tian!" As soon as Luo Tian appeared, he roared. This roar carried a touch of the Daoist method of Heaven and Man, like rolling thunder that stunned everyone's hearts.

The entire world suddenly fell silent. Everyone looked toward Luo Tian sitting on the golden small carriage, their eyes filled with reverence.

"Luo...Luo Senior..."

"What business do you have here?" Xue Zilong was the first to recover from his shock, stiffly addressing Luo Tian.

"What business? You dare ask me what business?" Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with anger. Everyone was stunned.

"Xue Zilong, you crippled my legs. Do you think this matter can just be forgotten?"

"During a normal duel, you struck so harshly. Today, if you don't give me an explanation, even though I've lost my legs, I'll make you pay the price!" Luo Tian shouted repeatedly, leaving people unable to react.

"You..." Xue Zilong and Wang Chuan were stunned. Xue Zilong's subordinates were also stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Shameless..." Wang Chuan and others' faces turned slightly red, feeling that Luo Tian was too shameless. He had nearly crushed someone to death and now demanded compensation, cheating people so openly. And it was a Commander of Ten Thousand doing this.

"No shame, only more shame!" Wang Chuan and others sighed inwardly. Previously, Luo Tian's scheme to steal their merits had already been shameless, but now he was coming for compensation from Xue Zilong...

Xue Zilong's face turned red and pale. He panted heavily, looking at Luo Tian without words, his eyes filled with frustration. His gaze was like "I'm going to ruin you, what can you do about it?"

"I really want to beat you, but I can't!" Xue Zilong cursed inwardly, forcing a smile on his face.

"Luo Senior, you're right. I was indeed wrong before, injuring you. I'll definitely compensate. One hundred million merits should be enough for you to recover!" Xue Zilong smiled lightly, cursing inwardly but still reluctantly sent one hundred million merits to Luo Tian.

"Ah, this shows some sincerity. Unfortunately, my injury is too severe!" Luo Tian patted his legs. Everyone could see that Luo Tian was extorting, but Xue Zilong had to endure it because of strength. Unless Ko Duanshan or Jiang Chen personally intervened.

"You..." Xue Zilong was so angry he almost spat blood. One hundred million merits, he could only save that when he was a Captain of Ten Thousand. Recently, he had fought for nine hundred million merits with his life—this was the benefit of becoming a Commander of Ten Thousand.

"Give me another hundred million, okay?" Xue Zilong gritted his teeth and gave Luo Tian another hundred million merits.

"Such a generous move! Commander Luo Tian, you just opened your mouth and got two hundred million merits!" People looked at Luo Tian with envy. Two hundred million merits, they had never achieved that in Bountiful Heaven City for years.

"Ten billion! Ten billion and I'll leave. Otherwise, Xue Zilong, my men won't let me be bullied!" Luo Tian roared, demanding ten billion merits. It almost made Xue Zilong spit out old blood.

"Ten billion..." Everyone inhaled sharply, their faces filled with disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Don't push me too hard!" Xue Zilong growled, ten billion merits—not only did he not have it, but even if he had, Xue Zilong wouldn't hand it over.

"Then I'll just beat you!" Luo Tian sneered, his Longyuan Sword emitting a continuous humming sound. This made Xue Zilong regain some clarity.

"Beat me? I'm not afraid of you!" Xue Zilong roared, his aura surging. Purple qi radiated from Xue Zilong's body.

"Then there's no choice!" Luo Tian let out a low laugh, drawing his Longyuan Sword. The sword's aura flickered as it slashed toward Xue Zilong.

"I'll fight you to the death!" Xue Zilong's eyes flashed with madness. A purple dragon shot from his hands, swirling toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The sword's aura flickered. The purple dragon clashed with the black sword's aura.

Chapter 2225: Clearing the Debt

"Roar..." The purple dragon clashed with the black sword, breaking through the purple dragon and slashing toward Xue Zilong.

"He's gotten stronger again!" Xue Zilong was shocked. He watched the sword's aura that threatened to crush him, and he raised his long sword to meet it.

"Crack..." Thunder roared again. The black great sword clashed with the purple long sword, and Xue Zilong's feet sent out a series of tremors. Cracks spread across the ground, and stones flew apart.

"My heavens! Commander Luo Tian is so strong? That's a peak of True Immortal!" Those who came with Luo Tian looked at him in shock, stunned by his overwhelming power.

"Pay or not pay?" Luo Tian sat on the golden small carriage, floating in the sky. His cold gaze looked at Xue Zilong.

"Daydream!" Xue Zilong roared, lifting his long sword to repel Luo Tian. His eyes flashed with madness.

"Buzz..." However, as Xue Zilong repelled Luo Tian's Longyuan Sword, Luo Tian immediately swung his sword downward again.

"Pu..." This time Xue Zilong was knocked out of breath, his eyes showing weakness.

Before Xue Zilong could retaliate, Luo Tian's third sword fell. The overwhelming aura of the sword made Xue Zilong feel extreme fear.

Luo Tian could suppress Xue Zilong even before he absorbed the earth's energy. Now, with his stronger strength and his unique Daoist method of Heaven and Man, he could easily suppress Xue Zilong without effort.

"I'll pay!" Xue Zilong roared, looking at the black great sword hovering over his head. He felt a life-threatening crisis. There was no way out, and he knew Luo Tian would really kill him. If it weren't for Ko Duanshan stopping Luo Tian before, he would have already died.

The great sword hovered just a hair's breadth above Xue Zilong's head, barely touching his purple long sword. This tiny gap made Xue Zilong feel a life-threatening crisis.

"Haha, Grand Commander Xue, your noble character is truly admirable!" Luo Tian's face once again showed a smile as he looked at Xue Zilong.

"Go to hell!" Xue Zilong cursed inwardly, his mouth constantly spitting blood. Whether it was anger or real injury, he didn't know. He waved his hand and seven hundred million merits fell onto Luo Tian's wrist.

"I still owe you one hundred million. I'll definitely give it to you another day..." Xue Zilong almost cried, never expecting himself to owe Luo Tian.

"Such a strong move!" People looked at Luo Tian in awe. In just three sword strikes, he had obtained ten billion merits.

"Truly poor..." Luo Tian was annoyed inwardly. He hadn't expected a Commander of Ten Thousand to be so poor.

"He still wants more..." People looked at Luo Tian with a look of disdain, feeling speechless.

Xue Zilong's eyes showed frustration. If he could fight Luo Tian, even with a slight chance, he would have fought to the death. This move by Luo Tian had wounded him deeply. Not only did he go bankrupt and owe one hundred million merits, but his prestige had also vanished instantly. Those who had defected to Xue Zilong in recent days now looked at him with changed eyes.

"Brothers, let's go!" Luo Tian laughed loudly and led the two ten-thousand troops away. He left Xue Zilong with a face as dark as night.

"I'll definitely take revenge on this Xue Zilong!" Xue Zilong gritted his teeth, shouting in his heart.

"Comrades,辛苦了. I definitely can't let you go through this for nothing. In the coming days, I'll cultivate pills for all of you. I can make pills below the sixth grade. If you need them, just come to me. No fee at all!" Luo Tian spoke to Wang Chuan and others, his words causing their eyes to light up.

"We completely forgot that Commander Luo Tian is also a pill cultivator!"

"No fee at all. That means if I have the herbs, I can get pills!" People were overjoyed.

"Below sixth grade, there are only three people in Bountiful Heaven City who can make them. They're kept as treasures by the city lord!"

"Being able to have those three old men cultivate pills, the cost isn't ordinary. Ha! It was worth staying!" Everyone laughed. No matter what Luo Tian's strength was, just the fact that he could cultivate pills would make him secure in his position. Even if someone challenged Luo Tian and failed, they would follow Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian was truly the Commander of Ten Thousand.

People scattered in chaos. Lei Yong, Ji Chen and Ye Liangchen remained behind, looking at Luo Tian.

"Kid, you're really generous. I've never seen you be so generous to your senior!" Lei Yong frowned, unwilling. In his view, Luo Tian giving them pills without charge was a waste. Lei Yong hated wasting.

"Senior, don't worry. Once I clear my debts, we'll leave this place!" Luo Tian smiled lightly and then spoke to Ye Liangchen: "Come on, Senior Tian, let's go show off!"

The three brothers and Ye Liangchen walked toward the Treasure Hall. Now, they were no longer ordinary soldiers. Luo Tian was even a Commander of Ten Thousand. Ye Liangchen had become a Captain of Ten Thousand. Lei Yong and Ji Chen needed no introduction; if they reached the peak of True Immortal, they would have the strength of a Commander of Ten Thousand.

As soon as the four appeared, people took notice. After all, Luo Tian's momentum had been too strong recently.

"Earlier I heard that Commander Luo Tian went to the newly promoted Commander of Ten Thousand Xue Zilong and extorted ten billion merits!"

"Ten billion! My heavens, I'll never earn ten billion merits in my life!" People's faces showed jealousy at Luo Tian's strength.

Under people's gaze, the four entered the Treasure Hall. As soon as they stepped in, Ye Liangchen let out a sigh of admiration.

"The Treasure Hall! I'm back again!" Ye Liangchen laughed loudly, immediately drawing the attention of the Treasure Hall staff.

"Ye Liangchen!" The staff member saw Ye Liangchen and his mouth twitched instantly. Although it had been years, people still remembered the scene when Ye Liangchen exchanged ten billion merits for a large amount of treasures.

"Commander, what business do you have personally?" The staff member smiled immediately and walked down. He had been the one who handled Ye Liangchen's exchange before, and that day was really busy.

"Take out all the ghost-repelling pills you have!" Luo Tian spoke softly, smiling at the staff member.

"All...all?" The staff member's face changed instantly. However, seeing Luo Tian, he knew something was about to happen again.

"Um...Commander, we currently have ten thousand ghost-repelling pills here..." The staff member spoke to Luo Tian.

"Ah, ten thousand. I'll take them all. Hurry up and bring them out!" Luo Tian said.

Luo Tian remembered that due to his relationship, the price of ghost-repelling pills had been set at one hundred merits. The exchange price also dropped to twenty-five thousand merits per pill. Now, Luo Tian's merits were enough to buy them all.

"Total twenty-five billion merits..." The staff member sighed longingly and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Yes!" Luo Tian heard the staff member's words but said nothing. He calculated in his mind, thinking it would be enough to clear his debts.

"Twenty-five billion!" People in the hall also gasped, amazed at Luo Tian's boldness.

"Quickly get them!" Ye Liangchen slapped the staff member awake, laughing loudly.

"Yes..." The staff member hurried up and started exchanging for Luo Tian. Ten thousand ghost-repelling pills were quickly taken by Luo Tian.

Combined with the ghost-repelling pills he had cultivated himself, Luo Tian finally cleared his debts from before. For those who hadn't obtained ghost-repelling pills, he also converted them into merits, allowing Luo Tian to sigh in relief and feel less burdened.

However, after Luo Tian had completely exchanged the ghost-repelling pills in the Treasure Hall, their price skyrocketed throughout Bountiful Heaven City.

"Damn it! How could there be none!" People who wanted to exchange ghost-repelling pills cursed loudly. Their bodies radiated waves of ghostly qi, very anxious. Although it wasn't life-threatening, it was extremely painful.

A group of soldiers with ghostly qi blocked the entrance to the Treasure Hall, glaring at the staff members with fierce eyes as if they wanted to devour them.

"It's not our fault. It was Commander Luo Tian who took all the ghost-repelling pills!" One staff member shouted, terrified by these ghostly qi soldiers.

"Commander Luo Tian..." People cursed inwardly but could only endure, not daring to trouble Luo Tian.

"Such an inhumane person! Isn't there anyone who can deal with him?" People roared, really suffering from the ghostly qi. They had to refine it through their cultivation, which would take a long time.

"I have ghost-repelling pills. Ten thousand merits, those who want them come find me!" As people cursed, those who received ghost-repelling pills from Luo Tian were happy. They sighed inwardly, thinking their trip to Demon Mountain hadn't been in vain. Now, the price of a ghost-repelling pill had soared to an astronomical level.

At this moment, Luo Tian didn't know that taking all the ghost-repelling pills had caused so much trouble. He was currently cultivating pills for his subordinates.

"He's a troublemaker!" Ko Duanshan heard people's discussions and felt headache. He really wanted to slap Luo Tian, but he was reluctant because of his strength. The existence of the Ghost-Repelling Seal was also a weakness for hellish creatures.

"Ko Duanshan, come here!" Jiang Chen's cold voice echoed in Ko Duanshan's mind. Ko Duanshan paused slightly, then moved his body toward Jiang Chen's courtyard.

"Let him go kill hellish creatures. If he stays here any longer, it will eventually turn the city upside down!" As Ko Duanshan entered Jiang Chen's courtyard, Jiang Chen immediately scolded him.

For years, Bountiful Heaven City had guarded the Hell Gate. Since Luo Tian arrived, there had been several disturbances. However, everything Luo Tian did was reasonable. Jiang Chen couldn't deal with him.

"Commander of the Eighth Legion, Luo Tian. From today on, he must leave Bountiful Heaven City and hunt hellish creatures. Whether it's during the Eighth Legion's guarding of Hell or not, he must follow the main force to kill creatures!" Jiang Chen's voice echoed throughout Bountiful Heaven City, causing people to pause slightly.

Chapter 2226: Revenge

"Deserved!" As people heard Jiang Chen's command, they let out a series of relieved voices. Especially at Xue Zilong's place, if it weren't for the crowd, Xue Zilong would have danced with joy.

"This is going to kill me!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze filled with coldness. On the battlefield, no one dared to say they could survive. Although Luo Tian was strong, he wasn't sure if he could come out alive.

"Why is Jiang Chen targeting me so many times?" Luo Tian's mind immediately questioned, his brows furrowed. Being targeted by an Immortal King wasn't good news. In Hell, he could calculate against the Immortal King, but in the Celestial Realm, he was a lone wolf.

"Need to leave. Otherwise I'll be played to death by Jiang Chen!" Luo Tian made a decision instantly. He stopped cultivating pills and sent messages to Ye Liangchen, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen. Then he flashed toward Ko Duanshan's residence.

Luo Tian appeared at the gate of Ko Duanshan's courtyard, only to find it locked. Ko Duanshan wasn't there. After waiting a while, Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Ye Liangchen arrived at the gate of Ko Duanshan's courtyard.

"Senior Tian, what happened with the city lord's message?" Ye Liangchen dropped his carefree demeanor and asked Luo Tian.

"I don't know. However, we can't stay in Bountiful Heaven City anymore. We need to leave!" Luo Tian spoke, recalling the previous time. If it weren't for his luck, he might have died in Hell. He had just returned and now another incident arose.

He was on the Hell's Kill List, and after his journey to Hell, he no longer felt hostility toward it. After all, in Hell, he was a Saint's Heir.

"Good! I've been wanting to leave. This place is too dangerous!" Ye Liangchen's eyes showed joy upon hearing Luo Tian's words. Fighting and killing in Bountiful Heaven City wasn't what Ye Liangchen wanted.

According to the rules, they had already passed their military service age. Therefore, if they wanted to leave now, Jiang Chen wouldn't have a reason to stop them.

"Orders must not be disobeyed!" As the four discussed, Ko Duanshan appeared before them. His face was gloomy as he spoke to the four.

"Commander, I request discharge. The city lord's actions clearly want to push me into a pit and kill me!"

"Previously, I was sent to find the Mother of the River of the Other Side and almost died. Now he wants me to die again. I don't accept it. What's the point of staying in this army?" Luo Tian shouted, his voice filled with anger.

"I know!" Ko Duanshan was also gloomy. He knew Jiang Chen's actions were clearly to kill Luo Tian, but he was a typical soldier whose obedience had become an instinct.

"But orders are hard to defy. Even if you want to retire now, the city lord won't agree!"

"I'll go into battle with you. You're my soldier, and I'll fight alongside you to ensure your safety as much as possible!" Ko Duanshan thought for a moment and sighed. This was the best plan he could think of.

"Commander..." Luo Tian's heart trembled. He hadn't expected Ko Duanshan to choose this method to save him.

"This doesn't need further discussion. Let's settle it like that!" Ko Duanshan spoke softly and stepped into the courtyard.

"This is a favor!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, his eyes filled with contemplation. He had made a decision.

Luo Tian was someone who valued gratitude and revenge. Whoever did him a favor would surely be repaid, and whoever had a grudge with him, he would either kill them or torment them.

"Senior Tian, are we leaving?" Ye Liangchen asked softly, looking at Luo Tian.

"I'll go back in a few days," Luo Tian smiled lightly. With the Bountiful Heaven Stone, his means of survival were relatively strong.

That day, Ye Liangchen and Lei Yong and Ji Chen chose to retire and no longer stayed in Bountiful Heaven City.

Jiang Chen didn't question them further. Ye Liangchen had always wanted to leave, and Lei Yong and Ji Chen had been in Bountiful Heaven City for years. It wouldn't be unreasonable to let them go.

The next day, Luo Tian saw the three off. Afterward, he gathered Tianfu's former subordinates and smiled.

"Commander!" Each soldier spoke. They naturally heard Jiang Chen's command. Jiang Chen had made it known to the entire Bountiful Heaven City, clearly issuing a death order.

"Don't worry. Zhang Xinghua, you challenge me. I'll let you take over my position as Commander of Ten Thousand."

"From today on, you must take care of these brothers!" Luo Tian spoke softly and gave Zhang Xinghua three hundred million merits. This was all the merits he had left.

Zhang Xinghua's strength wasn't weak. With these three hundred million merits, he could elevate his strength to another level and secure the position of Commander of Ten Thousand. This was also Luo Tian's way of giving a report to Tianfu and an explanation to the others.

"Senior..." Zhang Xinghua's heart trembled. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to gather them for this.

"Challenge me, and then use these three hundred million merits to enhance your strength. From now on, you'll have to rely on yourselves!" Luo Tian spoke.

"Yes!" Zhang Xinghua stood straight, looking at Luo Tian. Over these days, Luo Tian had freely cultivated pills for them, enhancing their strength significantly. Luo Tian's position among them was now solid. Although it wasn't as strong as Tianfu, they had already accepted Luo Tian as their Commander of Ten Thousand.

"I challenge Commander Luo Tian!" Sun Xinghua shouted loudly, looking at Luo Tian respectfully.

"Buzz..." Waves rose around the two of them. A barrier enclosed them.

"I surrender!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate at all and immediately spoke, giving Sun Xinghua his position as Commander of Ten Thousand.

"Alright, you all go back. I have other matters!" Luo Tian smiled and spoke to everyone.

"Salute!" Sun Xinghua stood straight, bowing respectfully to Luo Tian. The two ten-thousand troops also solemnly saluted Luo Tian by patting their chests.

"Go on, go on!" Luo Tian watched them leave. His eyes gradually became deep.

"Now, it's just me left," Luo Tian murmured as the sky darkened. He then found the Bountiful Heaven Stone and disappeared into his courtyard.

Dust drifted, and Luo Tian quickly arrived at Jiang Chen's residence. He saw Jiang Chen sitting in meditation.

"I really want to slice you with a sword!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with waves of killing intent. This slight killing intent made Jiang Chen open his eyes.

"Who?" The pressure of the Immortal King instantly descended. Realm power enveloped Luo Tian, making him immediately hold his breath and the Bountiful Heaven Stone began to sink into the ground.

"Thousand zhang...ten thousand zhang..." Soon, it descended to ten thousand zhang. Luo Tian stood on the red earth, his hands rising with waves of golden light. This golden light was the piece he had obtained from Demon Mountain. He hadn't thrown it out before, but now he knew where to throw it.

This piece was extraordinary, but Luo Tian dared not take it. He didn't want to get involved with the old man who had played chess with him. Luo Tian didn't believe Jiang Chen wouldn't be interested in this piece.

As soon as Luo Tian threw the piece out, Jiang Chen sensed the disturbance beneath the ground. His eyes narrowed slightly, and a sense of alarm passed through his mind.

"Boom..." Jiang Chen didn't hesitate at all. He punched through the ground, descending immediately. Soon he saw the piece Luo Tian had thrown out.

"What is this?" Jiang Chen's eyes narrowed slightly. He felt a strong danger on the piece but also sensed its extraordinariness—it was an ultimate treasure.

"Take it!" Jiang Chen didn't hesitate. He reached out and grabbed the piece, bringing it into his room to examine it.

"Old man, you want to kill me. I give you an opportunity instead. You should really thank me!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, controlling the Bountiful Heaven Stone and flying out of Jiang Chen's courtyard toward Xue Zilong's courtyard.

That night, a big event happened in Bountiful Heaven City. The Treasure Hall was secretly robbed, and one-third of its treasures were stolen.

In the Treasure Hall, they found Xue Zilong. However, he had a big bump on his forehead and couldn't explain what happened.

"This Xue Zilong has the guts to steal from our Treasure Hall!" People kept discussing. Jiang Chen was furious and had Xue Zilong imprisoned in a death cell.

However, no treasures from the Treasure Hall were found on Xue Zilong. This made people certain he had an accomplice.

"Wrong! I'm wrong!" Xue Zilong kept shouting. He didn't know what happened. He was meditating there and hadn't reacted before he was knocked out. When he woke up, he was caught.

"This matter, I know you're innocent, but it needs to give Bountiful Heaven City an explanation!" Jiang Chen spoke seriously. He hadn't expected anyone to steal the Treasure Hall under his nose.

"You definitely can't stay in Bountiful Heaven City. Go to Bountiful Heaven Mountain and endure some physical pain! This is the best result I can achieve!" Jiang Chen looked at Xue Zilong.

"Thank you, City Lord!" Xue Zilong's eyes showed frustration. He could only accept his fate and sighed inwardly, feeling unlucky. He didn't have the luck to be a Commander of Ten Thousand. Every time he became one, something happened. This time he had almost lost his life.

"City Lord, Luo Tian is missing!" As Xue Zilong felt bitter, a commander walked in.

"Missing?"

"Is he the one who stole the treasures? Or was he captured by that thief?" Jiang Chen felt puzzled, his eyes filled with contemplation. He then flashed messages to Xue Zilong.

Regarding the events in Bountiful Heaven City, Luo Tian was unaware. However, he could know that it would definitely anger Jiang Chen.

"I remember this grudge, Jiang Chen. When I enter the Immortal King realm, I'll definitely come back to Bountiful Heaven City!" Luo Tian had already flown out of Bountiful Heaven City and was heading toward the southern direction.

Chapter 2227: Surrounding Rising Dragon Sect

Rising Dragon Sect had established itself in the Middle Heaven after participating in the Struggle for Heaven. However, they knew their own strength and thus acted very discreetly.

Even if there were conflicts with other sects, Rising Dragon Sect chose to yield slightly and quietly developed their strength. Now, the Rising Dragon Sect's strength was also very formidable. Three elders had reached the peak of True Immortal. Plus, over the years, Shanhai Tree had grown significantly. There was also a ghostly creature formed by one of the elders, totaling five True Immortal peaks. This strength was already quite strong. However, there were no steps of an Immortal King as the sect's leader. Because Rising Dragon Sect's strength was still weaker than other sects by half a step.

In recent years, Star River Prefecture had taken good care of Rising Dragon Sect. Therefore, Rising Dragon Sect had survived.

In the Rising Dragon Sect stood a towering tree at the center of the mountain gate. This was Shanhai Tree, and on the tree lived Zang Yunfei, Pei Jianping, and Sima Xiu. In the tree house, three elders sat with dark expressions. Beside them were elders of various ranks in Rising Dragon Sect.

"Senior Elders, what should we decide? Today is the final deadline they gave us!" A middle-aged man stood up, his face filled with seriousness.

"Zuo Qiuming, sit down. You're about to become the sect leader. Don't be so impatient!" Li Changfeng and others, now members of the Supply Hall, looked at Zuo Qiuming and scolded him.

"Yes!" Zuo Qiuming sighed deeply, slowly sitting down. He looked at the three elders, Zang Yunfei.

"Have you informed Star River Prefecture about this?" Zang Yunfei asked, looking at Xuan Dan. Among Rising Dragon Sect, those with the most connections were Xuan Dan. Now, Xuan Dan had become an eighth-grade immortal pill cultivator. In the entire Middle Heaven and even Upper Heaven, there were few eighth-grade immortal pill cultivators.

"I did. However, I didn't get a response. These people are so bold and fearless. I guess Star River Prefecture also has problems!" Xuan Dan sighed deeply.

Star River Prefecture was the biggest support for Rising Dragon Sect. However, a few days ago when they sent people to Star River Prefecture to report, they hadn't received any response.

"What else is there to consider? Just surrender! Only by surrendering can we find a way out!" As people discussed, a child's voice echoed in their ears. This made everyone's mouths twitch.

"Stop talking nonsense, or I'll cut you!" Zang Yunfei roared, his voice filled with anger.

"I'm just giving a suggestion. Why are you so angry?" The child's voice didn't back down. He was still childish, thinking that surrendering wasn't a big deal. After all, he had surrendered to Rising Dragon Sect before, and they had treated him well.

"Even if we surrender, those sects won't let us go!" Sima Xiu sighed deeply. They had thought the matter was over, but those sects had brought up old memories again.

At first, Luo Tian had killed several sect elders' offspring in the Middle Heaven. At that time, Star River Prefecture had intervened and resolved it by having Luo Tian leave Rising Dragon Sect. However, recently those sects had sent messages one after another, bringing up the old issue and demanding Rising Dragon Sect to surrender and divide it. If they didn't surrender, the result would be the destruction of the sect.

"We have no choice but to fight. I'll contact my network accumulated over these years!" Xuan Dan spoke softly, his voice filled with helplessness. As an eighth-grade immortal pill cultivator, even if Rising Dragon Sect was destroyed, he wouldn't be in trouble. After all, an eighth-grade immortal pill cultivator's role was too great.

"Good. Then we'll fight with our backs to the wall. We've survived the hardest Struggle for Heaven, so what are we afraid of?"

"Send all those under fifty years old talents out. If necessary, send them to the Lower Heaven to preserve some of Rising Dragon Sect's legacy!" Pei Jianping spoke.

"Rising Dragon Sect, full-scale preparation for battle!" Zang Yunfei shouted loudly. His voice echoed in the heavy atmosphere of Rising Dragon Sect.

"Fight, what are you afraid of!" A series of shouts echoed in Rising Dragon Sect. These days, the sect's disciples had noticed something was wrong with Rising Dragon Sect. They saw that strong figures often probed around the sect.

"Looks like you're looking for death!" As Rising Dragon Sect's battle preparations spread, the four sects preparing to attack it also received the news and laughed.

"Ziyang Sect, tomorrow we'll attack Rising Dragon Sect..."

"Flying Spirit Sect, tomorrow we'll destroy Rising Dragon Sect..." A series of authoritative voices echoed from all directions around Rising Dragon Sect. Four sects, each with formidable strength.

As the voices faded, a powerful pressure arose from all four directions of Rising Dragon Sect. Figures appeared and surrounded the entire sect.

...The Middle Heaven was vast, but unlike Hell where there were few transmission arrays. The Middle Heaven had many transmission arrays, making it much more convenient to travel than Hell.

On the black road, Luo Tian walked continuously. This was the seventh day since he had left Hell.

Seven days without finding a city, everywhere was wasteland. This made Luo Tian feel bitter.

"Damn it! Why is the Hell Gate so far away? That's why I had to take a transmission array before. My current speed, after seven days, still haven't seen a city!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He hadn't expected the Hell Gate to be so remote.

"Alas..." However, Luo Tian didn't plan to return to Bountiful Heaven City. He could only press on. As time passed, the sky gradually turned blue instead of dark. The vitality and spiritual energy also became increasingly abundant, giving Luo Tian a glimmer of hope.

After walking for three more days, Luo Tian finally saw plants on the ground. To his surprise, he saw three figures.

They were all young men with True Immortal initial stage strength. They wore ordinary clothes, obviously not from any family or sect.

They also saw Luo Tian walking and flew toward him. Luo Tian also flew toward them, so he quickly arrived near the three of them.
