"Where is this small world so vast? I don't believe we can't find it!" Everyone refused to accept the fate, beginning to search one continent and one star after another. Luo Tian's day was a great harvest, having already understood the role of this world's heart and being able to control some rules within this small world, such as the flow of time.

"Should have known I didn't need to run!" Luo Tian muttered lowly, in this small world he was almost a god. Moreover, with the passage of time, this small world would gradually compress until it became an ultimate treasure of the world.

"World Power!" Another thing was that Luo Tian's heart blood had changed. Surprised, he discovered three drops of his heart essence contained terrifying power—world power. Once it erupted and burned, it would surely elevate Luo Tian to a terrifying level. This was the result of his one-day research. He didn't know if there were other benefits, but he was certain that these three drops of essence containing world power were a great blessing.

"But where did that evil soul go? It must have hidden itself, or perhaps... possessed a strong person!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, his eyes revealing a hint of worry. With that evil soul's strength, it could silently possess an Immortal King at the initial stage.

"It's time to go!" Luo Tian slowly stood up and stepped out of the cave. As soon as he appeared, a streak of light cut through the sky above his continent and appeared directly overhead.

"Luo Tian!" At the very moment that figure appeared, the person cried out in surprise and flew towards Luo Tian. Meanwhile, he took out his identity token and sent a message to his companions.

"From the Eastern Emperor Mountain?" Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile. At this moment, he most hoped to capture more people from the Eastern Emperor Mountain so that he could negotiate with the Eastern Emperor and try to exchange Fu Xingyang.

„Zong...“ Luo Tian waved his hand, the sky changed color. An invisible wave instantly wrapped the entire continent. The Eastern Emperor Mountain's strong person's face slightly changed because his identity token seemed to be sealed, unable to send messages.

"Come here!" While the strong person was surprised, Luo Tian appeared as if teleporting in front of him and punched his face with a fist.

„Peng...“ A solid punch, imbued with the ultimate truth of the Dao, smashed directly onto the strong person's face, knocking him down to the ground.

Dust flew everywhere. Although the entire continent trembled, it showed no signs of collapse. Luo Tian descended like a mighty demon god from the heavens, his body radiating an overwhelming pressure that made the stunned Immortal King's eyes reveal disbelief.

"How... how is this possible!" The strong person's mind was in turmoil. He hadn't expected that he had no chance to fight back against Luo Tian.

In a trance, Luo Tian's foot descended and shattered the strong person's body. Luo Tian waved his hands and immediately summoned the soul, feeling it was too troublesome to carry people.

"Next, it's my turn to hunt you. I hope those several peak Immortal Kings don't come too soon!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a slight smile. He waved his hands, and a series of demonic patterns flew out, etched into his body.

Chapter 2390: Arrival()

In the Xuan Yue Realm, countless Immortal Kings wandered around searching for Luo Tian's whereabouts. They wanted to seize the World Heart from him and take credit.

"Damn kid! We struggled so hard to break through the barrier, fought for so long. Why did he get the World Heart!" A big man was furious. Every time he reached a continent, without thinking, he immediately launched a fierce attack.

Just as the big man shattered a continent, a powerful pressure instantly wrapped around him. Within ten million miles of his surroundings, it was sealed off, making the big man's face change.

"What person!" The big man shouted and turned his body around, punching out. He directly pierced through the stars, colliding with a black fist.

In an instant, the big man's face showed disbelief. He spat blood and was sent flying back, colliding with a continent.

"Another one!" Luo Tian smiled lightly. Long Yuan Sword's aura was radiant, slicing through the big man's body and capturing his soul.

"In this small world, I have enough advantages!" Luo Tian muttered lowly. He vanished from the spot and headed for his next target.

Luo Tian's attacks were extremely ruthless. In this starry sky, he acted like a master, continuously hunting those who had previously chased him.

"One... two..." Time passed slowly. After seven days, Luo Tian had captured over a dozen Immortal Kings at the initial stage. Among them were strong people from the Nine Great Mountains and middle three sects.

"Where is Nie Yuntian?" Luo Tian was puzzled. He had been searching for Nie Yuntian these days, wanting to avenge the past.

However, as Luo Tian captured more people, those who had chased him gradually realized their companions couldn't contact them.

"Who is it? It can't be Luo Tian, right?" People were puzzled and began to suspect Luo Tian. They also noticed that their identities had changed significantly, starting to gather with their companions.

Nie Yuntian flew through the stars below, trying to meet up with the Immortal Kings from the Eternal Life Mountain.

"Finally found you!" Just as Nie Yuntian cursed, a light laugh suddenly echoed in his ears, making him tremble with fear.

"Luo Tian!" Nie Yuntian screamed and burst into a streak of light, flying away. However, Nie Yuntian was fast, but Luo Tian's speed was even faster. Having mastered some rules, he moved like a fish in water and appeared before Nie Yuntian instantly. He slapped his hand down, firmly suppressing him.

"Gate of Eternal Life!" Nie Yuntian saw Luo Tian's massive hand descending and immediately felt a life-or-death crisis. He instantly took out his strongest martial skill.

„Peng...“ However, the Gate of Eternal Life that previously required Luo Tian's full effort was no longer so formidable in front of Luo Tian's current state. One palm pushed it back, two palms shattered it. The powerful Gate of Eternal Life was instantly destroyed by Luo Tian's palm, turning into a violent storm that made Nie Yuntian spit blood.

"You..." Nie Yuntian had already confirmed that those missing people were definitely related to Luo Tian.

"What do you mean? I let you escape before. Now, you have no chance!" Luo Tian sneered and instantly appeared in front of Nie Yuntian. He slapped his face.

„Crack...“ The crisp sound of the slap echoed on Nie Yuntian's face. Soon, Nie Yuntian's face turned into a purple color.

Luo Tian finally released his anger. Fu Tiankui and Nie Yuntian were both captured by him.

"When I get out, I'll erase your cultivation and throw you into the Death Desert!" Luo Tian sneered. He had enough anger, so he shattered Nie Yuntian and captured his soul.

Nie Yuntian's eyes showed terror. He didn't know how Luo Tian had suddenly become so strong, and he was completely no match for Luo Tian. He didn't even have a chance to escape.

"Huh?" Luo Tian extended his hand and took Nie Yuntian's storage ring. His powerful spiritual sense directly erased Nie Yuntian's mark.

Light flashed, and a token appeared in Luo Tian's hand. It was black and shiny, emitting an ancient aura.

"Gui Gu Token!" Luo Tian's eyes lit up. He immediately took the token and stored it. This token was one he had, left by the super ancient power, Gui Gu Zi.

"Release Nie Yuntian's soul!" Just as Luo Tian had just taken the Gui Gu Token, a series of voices rose around him.

Several figures surrounded Luo Tian. Two Immortal Kings at the middle stage radiated powerful energy, while twelve Immortal Kings at the initial stage looked at Luo Tian with ill intent. The people were from the Eternal Life Mountain and its affiliated middle three sects. Among them, Luo Tian could recognize two people: Qin He Feng from the second major sect of the middle three, Tian Can Valley, and his father, an Immortal King at the middle stage, Qin Yuqing.

"Luo Tian, if you're smart, hand over the World Heart and Nie Yuntian's soul. Otherwise, this small world will be your grave!" The Immortal King at the middle stage from the Eternal Life Mountain shouted.

"Think you're so lucky. You think you can catch me?" Luo Tian sneered and pointed his finger. An invisible wave instantly flew out from his hand.

With one point, the starry sky changed dramatically. Those surrounding Luo Tian instantly felt their bodies uncontrollable, and their vision twisted.

In an instant, Luo Tian vanished from the spot. Those surrounding him recovered instantly, their eyes filled with shock.

"Time! Stillness!" Qin He Feng cried out. He knew Luo Tian was strong, but he hadn't expected him to be so powerful that even something like rules could be influenced.

...

The Immortal King at the middle stage from the Eternal Life Mountain was懊恼 and hit towards Luo Tian's escape direction. His heart was drumming, as that moment had completely taken away the Immortal King's confidence. If Luo Tian had killed him at that time, he wouldn't have been in good shape either.

"In this small world, no one can harm him. Unless it's an Immortal King at the late stage or peak!" Qin Yuqing spoke, his voice carrying a heavy tone.

"Correct. Although we can injure him, we cannot capture him. He has mastered part of this small world's rules. It must be because of the World Heart!" The Immortal King at the middle stage from the Eternal Life Mountain also spoke softly, his voice carrying a dark tone.

"Gather together. Otherwise, we might be picked off one by one. Now, all we can do is wait for the Immortal Kings to come in and catch this kid!" The old man spoke again, his voice carrying helplessness.

Anger spread throughout the Xuan Yue Realm. Most people were furious. They had struggled for decades, and now it was a kid who benefited. Moreover, this kid was still hunting them, forcing them to gather together to avoid it.

"This kid really does everything. I felt that he had a certain drive back then..." Jiang Taibai's face showed a bitter smile.

"I didn't expect him to grow so fast!" Ye Sheng's face also showed admiration. He thought back on how he had treated Luo Tian before and looked at his two brothers, having to admire Ye Wudao and Ye Tian's eyes.

As people gathered together, Luo Tian stopped hunting. He found a place to hide casually. After all, he feared no one now.

"Trouble will come after leaving!" Luo Tian thought. He was thinking about how to face the numerous Immortal Kings at the peak after leaving.

However, Luo Tian wasn't without confidence. The Ten Courts of Hell were all here. Hehui and Baihu, those two guys would definitely not leave him alone.

Time passed slowly. In the Xuan Yue Realm, a month had passed. In the Immortal realm, it was just an hour.

"Entered!" When the powerful world force that blocked the peak Immortal Kings dissipated, numerous peak Immortal Kings rushed in, charging towards the healing void rift.

"Haha! After waiting for so many years, finally can enter!" The Ten Courts of Hell laughed and rushed into the Xuan Yue Realm, wanting to kill the one with the World Heart first.

Almost instantly, they appeared in the Xuan Yue Realm. Peak Immortal Kings were almost omnipotent. Upon their appearance, they immediately noticed the situation in the Xuan Yue Realm.

"Many people are missing!" Everyone was slightly stunned. They found that those who had entered the Xuan Yue Realm were missing nearly thirty people.

"Luo Tian!" At the same moment, they felt Luo Tian and sensed his changed aura.

"Has he come?" Luo Tian also reacted instantly, flying up and appearing under the stars. Almost at the same moment as Luo Tian's appearance, those peak Immortal Kings arrived instantly, almost like masters of the Xuan Yue Realm.

"Good!" Bu Tian Immortal King laughed and his body turned into a shadow, instantly appearing beside Luo Tian. His eyes carried a smile towards everyone.

Almost at the same moment as Bu Tian Immortal King's appearance, Eternal Life Immortal King also attacked. Surprisingly, the first to attack wasn't from the Ten Courts of Hell or the Huahai Heaven Palace.

A green hand seemed to contain infinite vitality but carried a life-destroying power, slamming towards Luo Tian.

"Eternal Life!" Bu Tian Immortal King sneered and also punched out, instantly colliding with the green hand.

„Boom...“ The entire starry sky shook due to their collision. A violent power spread everywhere, and the deafening sound of collision made the Xuan Yue Realm tremble.

"This power is from a peak Immortal King!" People in the Xuan Yue Realm instantly felt their confrontation, their bodies shaking and flying towards Luo Tian's group with excitement.

Chapter 2391: Negotiation()

In the Xuan Yue Realm, everyone stood up and flew towards Luo Tian's group. After being trapped in the Xuan Yue Realm for so long, they were naturally excited.

However, Luo Tian's mood was not good. Standing beside Bu Tian Immortal King, he looked at those elders up close. His breathing was difficult because their spiritual pressure was too strong. If it weren't for Bu Tian Immortal King's protection, he would have already spat blood from the collision just now.

"Respect Bu Tian Immortal King. This is the World Heart I obtained in the Xuan Yue Realm!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, waving his hand. A golden heart appeared in his hands, instantly drawing the attention of all peak Immortal Kings.

"Hmm..." Bu Tian Immortal King's eyes slightly moved, looking at Luo Tian with a subtle meaning. He took the golden heart. This world heart was not the one from the Xuan Yue Realm but the one from the Starry Realm, borrowed by Jiang Yuzhe to Luo Tian. Now, Luo Tian returned it to Bu Tian Immortal King.

"Nothing... " Luo Tian sighed deeply in his heart. He was most afraid of Bu Tian Immortal King saying something, which would make him truly dangerous.

Clearly, Luo Tian had gambled correctly. Although he didn't know the reason, Bu Tian Immortal King took back the world heart from the Starry Realm and looked at other peak Immortal Kings.

"The rest has nothing to do with you!" Bu Tian Immortal King spoke softly, raising his hand and tearing the sky. He indicated Luo Tian to enter.

"Immortal King Ancestor, our sect's strong people were killed by Luo Tian!" Just as Luo Tian was about to enter the void rift, several figures appeared.

"Eastern Emperor Ancestor, our Eastern Emperor Sect's Fu Tiankui and Fu Banshan were also killed by Luo Tian!" Another person spoke, their voice carrying sorrow.

"Eternal Life Immortal King, your disciple Nie Yuntian was also killed by Luo Tian..." Not only one person spoke. Other sects from the three middle realms and other strong people also loudly spoke, their eyes looking at Luo Tian with hatred.

"What..." Upon hearing the people's words, several peak Immortal Kings were slightly stunned. They thought it was an accident during the competition for the World Heart, but they hadn't expected so many people to be killed by Luo Tian. When they saw the intact members of Bu Tian Sect, they knew this wasn't a false accusation but a real event.

"Bu Tian, when did your sect become so strong?" Eternal Life Immortal King took a step forward and looked at Bu Tian Immortal King.

"Bu Tian, if you don't give us an explanation today, I will declare war against you!" Tian Hun Immortal King spoke coldly.

Other major Immortal Kings, except for the beautiful woman from Yaochi and Amitabha Buddha, all looked at Bu Tian Immortal King with anger.

"World Heart is still on that kid!" The Ten Courts of Hell's cold-eyed elder spoke, a black-cloaked old man. His eyes flashed with an emerald color and looked at Luo Tian, transmitting a message to Hei Bai Chang.

"Let's attack together and catch him!" Other hell-born strong people whispered among themselves, but Hei Bai Chang refused.

"I advise you not to target this kid. Otherwise, you'll regret it!" Hei Bai Chang replied, making the others confused.

"Did you always protect this kid from the beginning? Tell me why. It's not because he is your Wheel Turning Sect's saint son, right? This kid is clearly an Immortal realm cultivator!" Huangtian Sect's sect master spoke, his voice carrying disdain.

"Reincarnation!" Hei Bai Chang only said two words and didn't speak further, but it made the other sect masters silent. They looked at Luo Tian with suspicion and abandoned their intention to attack him.

"This kid will eventually return to hell. He was destined for hell!" Hei Bai Chang was satisfied with the others' reactions.

"Because of your words, I actually believe it. This kid killed all the Immortal Kings from every sect in the Immortal realm. It's impossible for him to stay here anymore!" Huangtian Sect master looked at the several major Immortal Kings surrounding Bu Tian Immortal King, and he smiled.

"Of course, I didn't expect you to protect this kid from the beginning. You knew his identity all along, right?" Then several sect masters became angry.

"Who wants to fight? I'll accompany you!" Bu Tian Immortal King sneered and spoke boldly, his gaze sweeping over Eternal Life Immortal King and others.

A beautiful woman stood beside Bu Tian Immortal King. Her eyes carried coldness, looking at Eternal Life Immortal King and others. Though her face had some wrinkles, the power she radiated was astonishingly formidable.

Yaochi Holy Mother, Ji Tianhe, the only female Immortal King among the nine major sects. No one in the gathering dared to underestimate this woman.

Luo Tian looked at Bu Tian Immortal King and clearly felt that Ji Tianhe standing beside him made Bu Tian Immortal King somewhat uncomfortable.

"Amitabha! Everyone, it's better not to fight!" Amitabha Buddha looked at the Ten Courts of Hell and the Bu Tian Immortal King who had started colliding with domain boundaries.

"Haha, fight, fight. If you kill one of us, we definitely won't take advantage of you. If you kill one of us, hell will not enter the Immortal realm for a thousand years!" A sect master laughed.

"Hey, I didn't kill them!" Just as the atmosphere was tense, Luo Tian's voice rang out.

"What?" Bu Tian Immortal King's face showed great joy upon hearing Luo Tian's words. If he hadn't killed anyone, everything would be easy.

"No one was killed!" Luo Tian waved his hand and released a series of souls. Powerful souls floated above his head, totaling twenty-seven—those he had captured in the past few days.

"This..." People saw the twenty-seven souls floating above Luo Tian's head and showed shock.

"Haha, good!" Bu Tian Immortal King laughed heartily. If it were really a fight with these people, he wouldn't have had a good outcome either.

But Luo Tian hadn't killed them and left their souls, which was easier to handle. With their methods, they could revive these people.

"How about it? Are you still going to fight us?"

"No one was killed. My Bu Tian Sect has done enough!" Bu Tian Immortal King sneered and looked at everyone.

"Brother Jiang, this is a misunderstanding!" The elder from the Medicine King Sect quickly smiled and spoke to Bu Tian Immortal King.

"Take it back!" Bu Tian Immortal King didn't trouble the elder from the Medicine King Sect. After all, they had spoken well for them before.

However, others wanting to take it back wouldn't be easily accepted by Bu Tian Immortal King. Now the initiative was in their hands.

"Something's wrong, our Ghost King Sect is missing one person!" However, just as Bu Tian Immortal King had taken control of the initiative, Duan Baihong from the Ghost King Sect spoke up. His voice carried confusion and a cold gaze toward Luo Tian.

"We're missing people too!" Upon hearing Duan Baihong's words, other major Immortal Kings also looked at the souls above Luo Tian's head.

"Missing?" Upon hearing everyone's words, Luo Tian's face slightly changed. He hadn't hidden anyone at all. Even Fu Tiankui and Nie Yuntian's souls were released, to avoid trouble for Bu Tian Immortal King.

"How could it be!" Luo Tian's heart suddenly panicked. No matter what, no matter who killed them, this stink would definitely be pinned on him.

"Brother Jiang, are you still trying to get conditions from us?" Eternal Life Immortal King sneered and said.

"Of course, Bu Tian, you must give us an explanation!" Other major Immortal Kings also spoke, and the atmosphere fell into tension again.

"What do you want?" Bu Tian Immortal King asked. Standing beside Luo Tian, his aura enveloped the souls captured by Luo Tian.

"They definitely know that those missing people weren't killed by me!" Luo Tian understood immediately from the major Immortal Kings' tone. These were old monsters, their eyes were empty. They could guess that the people weren't killed by Luo Tian because if they had been, he would have killed them all. Why leave so many to negotiate? These people were just trying to make Bu Tian Immortal King pay a price.

"I can pay the price, and I'll ensure everyone is satisfied. However, no one must be killed!" Bu Tian Immortal King spoke. They had indeed obtained the World Heart, and paying some compensation to these people was no problem.

"With that statement, I'm at ease!" Except for Eternal Life Immortal King, other major Immortal Kings' faces regained their previous smiles.

"Eastern Emperor Ancestor, my friend was previously captured by your Eastern Emperor Sect. Please return him!" Luo Tian extended his hand and took Fu Tiankui and another soul from the Eastern Emperor Sect, looking at the Eastern Emperor.

"Are you threatening me?"

"You're nothing, how dare you threaten me!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the Eastern Emperor's face turned dark. He looked at Luo Tian with a powerful spiritual pressure.

"No, I was just worried about my friend's safety!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He felt that this threat was nothing to the Eastern Emperor, a high-level cultivator.

"Haha, this kid must have lost his mind. Daring to threaten the Eastern Emperor!" People's eyes showed mockery, looking at Luo Tian as if he were a fool.

"Give me those two souls!" The Eastern Emperor spoke, his voice carrying an unyielding tone.

Luo Tian remained silent and didn't act. Instead, he looked at the Eastern Emperor with a determined gaze.

"Kid, first give him the souls. Your friend's matter will be resolved later. First, solve this issue!" Bu Tian Immortal King transmitted a message to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian waved his hand and forcibly suppressed the urge to crush Fu Tiankui and that Eastern Emperor Sect strong person's soul. He released their souls.

Chapter 2392: Home()

Seeing Fu Tiankui and Fu Banshan's souls, the Eastern Emperor showed satisfaction. He took their souls in.

"That's better. Kid, don't think because someone supports you that you're superior. Face must be earned. In my eyes, you are still nothing!" The Eastern Emperor sneered and looked at Luo Tian with disdain.

"As for the friend you mentioned, rest assured. We'll treat him well in our Eastern Emperor Sect!" The Eastern Emperor spoke again, making Luo Tian's face more difficult.

"Alright, since no one has any objections, let's go out first!" Bu Tian Immortal King spoke softly. He didn't say anything to the Ten Courts of Hell either. He extended his hand and tore open the void, leading Luo Tian and others to leap into the void rift.

Time and space twisted. The next moment, people appeared in the ruined city of Mo Yun. Everyone's faces showed admiration, as they had been trapped in the Xuan Yue Realm for nearly a hundred years.

Luo Tian's face remained gloomy. He felt his strength was weakened and had returned to normal levels, sighing in his heart.

"Let's go! Back to Bu Tian Sect!"

"Everyone, I'll send compensation to you later!" Bu Tian Immortal King spoke. This time, it was the Bu Tian Sect that gained the greatest benefit.

"It's really a shame. We went to the Immortal realm for nothing and returned empty-handed!" The Ten Courts of Hell spoke with annoyance, but they smiled slightly at Luo Tian and flew up again, turning into a black cloud and disappearing.

"We'll be waiting!" Several peak Immortal Kings' faces were filled with smiles as they left. Only Eternal Life Immortal King remained, looking at Luo Tian deeply.

"Kid, we'll meet again!" Eternal Life Immortal King spoke softly, not hiding the greed in his eyes.

Bu Tian Immortal King said nothing. Now it was a special situation, and these people could only stay in the lower three realms. If Eternal Life Immortal King wanted to harm Luo Tian, it could only be in the upper three realms.

Bu Tian Immortal King led Luo Tian and others to Huantian City. At this time, the city was still bustling with people.

Luo Tian and others landed in Huantian City but didn't cause any commotion. The people around them looked at Luo Tian and others as if they hadn't seen anything.

They quickly arrived at the teleportation array. Luo Tian hurriedly spoke to Bu Tian Immortal King: "Immortal King Master Bu Tian, I'll go to the lower three realms first and manage my sect's affairs!"

Luo Tian's words made Nan Gong Yuqing and others' eyes show a hint of excitement. They looked at Bu Tian Immortal King.

"Ah, go ahead. But be careful!" Bu Tian Immortal King didn't stop Luo Tian.

"Little brother, be careful. It's almost the time to fight for heaven, and the lower three realms have a suppression on Immortal Kings at the initial stage. If you stay too long, your cultivation will be suppressed to half an Immortal King!" Ye Wudao, Ye Sheng, and Ye Tian had accompanied Luo Tian and others to Huantian City. They gave a few words of advice before heading towards Star River Prefecture.

"Will be suppressed?" Upon hearing Ye Wudao's words, Luo Tian was slightly stunned. He thought of Xiang Tianming. Xiang Tianming was from the Water Clan. If he were suppressed to half an Immortal King in the lower three realms, his strength would definitely be greatly reduced.

"However, with Fu Xingyue there, it should be fine!" Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile. He was quite excited. Luo Tian had been in the Immortal realm for many years, and now he had finally established a sect.

"Who are you?" Just as Luo Tian was lost in thought, a voice echoed. It made Luo Tian and others pause slightly.

An old man was seated there. His appearance was familiar to Luo Tian, the old man who had tampered with their teleportation array before. He was a supply official from Bu Tian Sect.

With Bu Tian Immortal King present, the old man didn't recognize Luo Tian and others. Instead, he spoke with authority.

"It's him!" Jiang Yuzhe obviously recognized the old man. He remembered that time had passed, and now he was an Immortal King at the initial stage. He was also the younger sect leader of Bu Tian Sect, and his status was no less than that of the old man.

"If we hadn't come to Huantian City, I would have almost forgotten!" Jiang Yuzhe sneered and looked at the old man: "We're here to take the teleportation array to the upper three realms. Please grant us permission!"

"Oh? Show me your identity token!" The old man's eyes flickered slightly. Naturally, he had heard about the events that happened in Mo Yun City recently. Now there were many people in the middle three realms he couldn't afford to offend.

"This is our token!" Jiang Yuzhe handed the old man a Star River Prefecture token.

"Who are you?" The old man took the token and carefully examined Jiang Yuzhe, not recognizing him. His eyebrows slightly twitched.

"Teleportation fee: five hundred large-sized immortal crystals!" The old man spoke softly, his voice carrying authority and a high-class demeanor.

Bu Tian Immortal King smiled and watched the old man without saying anything, waiting to see Jiang Yuzhe's performance.

"Senior, this is a Star River Prefecture teleportation token. Didn't you say that those with teleportation tokens don't need to pay any teleportation fee?" Jiang Yuzhe remained calm and spoke to the old man.

"Who said that? Let Ye Wudao come over, and he'll do the same!" The old man sneered. He knew all the people from Star River Prefecture, but he didn't know this kid. The old man looked down on him.

"Why did I not need to pay a teleportation fee when I went to the upper three realms last time?" Jiang Yuzhe sneered and stepped out of Bu Tian Immortal King's aura, revealing his true appearance.

"You..." The old man's face changed instantly. He immediately stood up.

"Supply Official, Jiang Yukun pays respects to the Young Sect Leader!" The old man spoke loudly. Although the status of a supply official was equal to that of a young sect leader, everyone knew that the young sect leader would inevitably become the sect master of Bu Tian Sect. Therefore, the old man dared not offend him.

The old man immediately realized that it was he who had tampered with the teleportation array of Luo Tian and others before. He originally thought Jiang Yuzhe would never become the young sect leader, but in the end, it was Jiang Yuzhe who had won the biggest prize. These years, Jiang Yuzhe had already possessed some of the characteristics of a leader. In Bu Tian Sect, he had seized power and cleansed his brothers' wings.

"Did you know that you framed me and almost killed me in the teleportation array? Do you know your crime?" Jiang Yuzhe spoke coldly, looking at the old man with sweat on his forehead.

"I..." Jiang Yukun didn't know what to say. It was indeed him who had done it. He had been worried before, but later Jiang Yuzhe didn't pursue the matter. Since he was a supply official, he had been somewhat overconfident, thinking this issue was over. However, after so many years, Jiang Yuzhe had suddenly come back.

Thinking about this, Jiang Yukun's heart flashed with a crazy thought. He looked at the current Jiang Yuzhe, who was there with Luo Tian and others. They were nothing to fear. The display was only a true Immortal King at the peak, but Jiang Yuzhe was an Immortal King at the initial stage. He had just ascended, and he was about to enter the middle stage. He thought that defeating Jiang Yuzhe should be no problem.

"Kill him, and the third prince will have a chance to become the young sect leader. Now that the middle three realms are so chaotic, who knows who killed the young sect leader!" Jiang Yukun's heart was filled with murderous intent. He wanted to kill Jiang Yuzhe in one strike. He had an 80% chance of killing Jiang Yuzhe without his guard.

"Kill!" Almost instantly after making the decision, Jiang Yukun moved. His body's fierce energy condensed into a gray hand.

Full power attack, nearly draining Jiang Yukun's entire cultivation. This strike was enough to kill any Immortal King at the initial stage, including Jiang Yuzhe who was still standing there.

Everyone was slightly stunned. They hadn't expected Jiang Yukun to be so ruthless, directly wanting to kill Jiang Yuzhe.

But Bu Tian Immortal King was here. Even ten Jiang Yukuns couldn't kill Jiang Yuzhe. Bu Tian Immortal King's face showed no expression, watching the gray hand instantly descend onto Jiang Yuzhe's head.

Bu Tian Immortal King sneered and withdrew his aura. At the same time, Jiang Yukun's full power gray hand exploded into pieces above Jiang Yuzhe's head. A violent wave instantly collapsed the small courtyard, and Luo Tian and others appeared in Jiang Yukun's line of sight.

"Jiang Yukun, you did well!" Bu Tian Immortal King spoke softly. His aura was imposing without anger. He looked at Jiang Yukun, making him tremble.

"Bu... Bu Tian Immortal King..." Jiang Yukun immediately fell to the ground, looking at Bu Tian Immoral King and speaking in a trembling voice.

What could he say? Killing someone's son right in front of him. Even though Jiang Yukun was a supply official, he couldn't escape the crime.

"Take him away. Let you handle it. You want to ascend, and this is a good opportunity!" Bu Tian Immortal King spoke softly and stepped onto the teleportation array to the upper three realms.

Luo Tian's body flickered and appeared beside Jiang Yukun. He slapped him, directly making Jiang Yuzhe spit blood and fall to the ground.

"Old man, you really messed me up back then!" Luo Tian kept attacking, making Jiang Yukun scream in pain.

After beating him for a quarter of an hour and almost killing him, Luo Tian stopped. He had released his anger.

"Senior Brother, I'll go first!" Jiang Yuzhe didn't stop Luo Tian. He grabbed the half-dead Jiang Yukun and entered the teleportation array with Bu Tian Immortal King.

Luo Tian and others watched Bu Tian Immortal King and Jiang Taibai leave, bowing in respect.

"When will we reach this level? I think the entire Immortal realm will be ours!" Ren Hongzhe's eyes showed admiration. They were still too weak now.

"One day, we will. When we could reach the peak in the Nine Realms, how can the Immortal realm be any different!"

"You go first. I'll fetch Qian Xue and then find you!" Huo Zhu spoke confidently, standing up and leaving to go to the Sand Sea King City.

"Let's go!"

"We're going home!" Luo Tian spoke with Nan Gong Yuqing and others, heading towards the teleportation array to the lower three realms.

"Please activate the lower teleportation array!" Luo Tian spoke to the terrified guard who had been guarding the teleportation array in Huantian City.

Chapter 2393: Three Major Sects()

"Yes!" The guard regained consciousness and trembled as he activated the teleportation array for Luo Tian. He was full of worry, wondering if something else would go wrong.

Seeing Luo Tian and others disappear into the teleportation array, numerous guards were stunned for half a moment. They looked at the house that had been collapsed by Bu Tian Immortal King's aura before regaining their senses.

"Was that Bu Tian Immortal King?"

"I actually saw Bu Tian Immortal King!" Numerous guards' eyes showed excitement. To them, seeing Bu Tian Immortal King was already a great honor.
