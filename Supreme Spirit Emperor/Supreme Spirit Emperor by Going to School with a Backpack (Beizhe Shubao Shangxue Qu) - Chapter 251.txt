“Fur Elder, we have summoned the Demon Lord from his seclusion. Please accompany me into the Demon Clan for a discussion!” The elder at the peak of Sage level addressed Diao Yuanshan.

“Demon Lord!” Upon hearing the elder’s words, Diao Yuanshan’s hunched form straightened slightly, his face bearing a trace of reverence.

Demon Lord Nan Gongzhong, the Sovereign of the Demon Clan, was the most central figure within the entire clan. He stood on par with the Divine King of the Celestial Clan and the Dragon Ancestor of the Beast Domain, existing in the same epoch. Even Diao Yuanshan, despite his prowess, was dwarfed by the Demon Lord’s presence.

“Do not trouble yourself. I am merely here to take a look. Do not disturb the Demon Lord’s esteemed presence!” Diao Yuanshan smiled, addressing the three elders of the Demon Clan at peak Sage level.

The onlookers, upon hearing their exchange, bore expressions of astonishment. They had not expected Diao Yuanshan’s influence to be so immense that it had drawn the Demon Lord himself from seclusion.

“Haha, Yuanshan, it has been years. Your cultivation has indeed advanced,” a gentle voice echoed from the mountain’s summit, laced with nostalgia. At the same time, a wisp of black mist drifted from the peak and materialized before them in the form of an elder.

The elder, like Diao Yuanshan, radiated an aura of age and wisdom. His face was serene, draped in a black robe, yet his presence exuded formidable might.

“Celestial Beast Domain’s Diao Yuanshan, pays homage to the Demon Lord!” Facing a peer of Long Zhan Tian’s era, Diao Yuanshan did not dare to be complacent. He bowed slightly and clasped his fists in respect.

“Why does the Demon Lord seem so weak? It appears he is merely at peak Sage level,” remarked one of the onlookers, gazing at Demon Lord Nan Gongzhong.

“That is an avatar! My true self has not arrived!” Luotian’s eyes turned violet, his gaze filled with awe as he stared at the Demon Lord. He could not fathom how formidable the Demon Lord’s true self must be, given that even a single avatar had reached peak Sage level.

“My heavens! If his avatar is at peak Sage, then his true self must be in the early Epoch!” Diao Yuanshan, Long Jie, and Chen Zhanbiao exclaimed in unison, their voices laced with disbelief.

“Haha, Yuanshan, I have been in seclusion. This avatar’s visit—do you not hold it against me?” The Demon Lord smiled, casting a glance over the younger generation. His expression held admiration, especially when he beheld Long Jie, his face betraying a flicker of surprise.

“Of course not! The mere presence of the Demon Lord’s avatar is a great honor for me!” Diao Yuanshan shook his head gently, a smile playing on his lips.

“Enough. Let the young ones have their fun. It has been a long time since we last met. Come, let us catch up,” the Demon Lord said to Diao Yuanshan.

“With great pleasure!” Diao Yuanshan leapt into the air, standing before the Demon Lord. The two ascended toward the mountain’s peak.

“Haha, Nan Gongzhong! It is no easy feat to meet you again. Why did you not wait for me?” A streak of crimson light flashed, and two figures—old and young—materialized before the onlookers.

“Yan Xiuluo!” Upon hearing the voice, Diao Yuanshan’s expression darkened instantly. His gaze turned icy as he beheld the two figures wreathed in blood-red energy.

“Haha, Diao Yuanshan, do not glare at me like that. We met just days ago!” Yan Xiuluo laughed, stepping before the Demon Lord and Diao Yuanshan.

“Yan Xiuluo, you dare to send an avatar? Do you not fear that I shall eradicate this avatar and your so-called ‘Sage Prince’?” Diao Yuanshan’s aura surged, his gaze locked onto Yan Xiuluo, a glint of murder in his eyes.

“Enough. We are old friends. It is rare to meet again—let us not resort to violence,” the Demon Lord smiled, gently patting Diao Yuanshan’s shoulder.

“Indeed. Why start with violence? We have not seen each other in years—let us speak at length!” Yan Xiuluo smiled, his demeanor unfazed by Diao Yuanshan’s threat.

“What is going on?” The crowd was stunned, watching the three titans of the Nine Domains—each a domain master in their own right. They had never seen such an assembly at a Demon Clan ritual, and for the first time in years, the event felt unusually lively.

“Do you think the other domain masters will also arrive?” The onlookers murmured, excitement in their eyes.

“Yan Hongtao?” Luotian smiled faintly, gazing at the young figure standing beside Yan Xiuluo. It was none other than Yan Hongtao, the one who had nearly taken his life in their previous clash.

It was Yan Hongtao who had stolen a fragment of the Epoch Scripture from Diao Dezhu, prompting Shura Domain to launch an entire campaign—only for it to end in vain.

As Luotian locked eyes with Yan Hongtao, the latter also spotted him. A latent battle aura flared between them.

“Hongtao, go and mingle with these young ones. The three of us old men shall catch up,” Yan Xiuluo instructed Yan Hongtao.

“Understood!” Yan Hongtao smirked, launching himself toward Luotian. At the same time, his aura of late Sage level erupted, and he descended upon Luotian with a blood-red palm.

“Late Sage level! Is this the so-called ‘Sage Prince’?” The onlookers gasped, their eyes wide with disbelief at Yan Hongtao’s power and the tremors his palm emitted.

“An initiation?” Luotian smiled, raising his hand. Golden divine power surged through it, unhesitatingly colliding with the sky.

“Boom…” The collision of golden and blood-red lightning sent shockwaves across the mountain.

“These two are prodigies of the Nine Domains. Their clash would be spectacular—whether Luotian, the ‘Sage Prince Slayer,’ or Yan Hongtao, the Shura Sage Prince, would prevail remains to be seen,” the onlookers mused, their eyes alight with excitement.

Above, Nan Gongzhong, Diao Yuanshan, and Yan Xiuluo exchanged glances, admiration in their eyes as they watched Luotian and Yan Hongtao.

“These two possess the potential to become Epoch Lords. In their future struggles for the title, they will surely claim a place,” Nan Gongzhong mused.

“The other young men are no slouches either. If they continue to grow, they could ensure the Four Sacred Star Domains endure for another epoch,” Yan Xiuluo cast a contemplative gaze over Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao, his expression tinged with admiration.

“Indeed, the Four Sacred Star Domains have finally produced some promising figures,” Nan Gongzhong nodded, his voice laced with admiration.

After a brief exchange of glances, the three elders vanished from sight under the people’s reverent gazes.

“Boy, you’ve improved quite a bit since last time,” Yan Xiuluo mused, flexing his numb fists as he addressed Luotian.

Chapter 1077: Shattered ( )

“Boy, you’ve improved quite a bit since last time,” Yan Hongtao smiled as he addressed Luotian.

“After being assassinated by so many cats and dogs, if I hadn’t improved, my life would’ve been over already!” Luotian replied without giving Yan Hongtao the courtesy of a smile, directly referencing Shura Domain’s assassination attempts against him.

“Alas, we are paid to do this. After all, Shura Domain is poor!” Yan Hongtao shook his head.

“Still, you’re not bad. At least better than Feng Jiutian of the Celestial Beast Domain. That fool is still recovering from his injuries, and he was only a late Sage level assassin! It’s quite embarrassing,” Yan Hongtao said with disdain, openly admitting that Feng Jiutian had been targeted by Shura Domain.

“Late Sage level!” Luotian felt a chill. Previously, his assassin had only been at early Sage level—this meant future attacks would likely involve stronger forces.

The onlookers watched the young men with interest, even the three elders of the Demon Clan turned their gazes toward Luotian and his companions. They knew these youths would likely become the most dazzling figures in the next epoch.

“Luotian, you’ve returned!” A thunderous voice echoed as several young figures appeared before the crowd.

“Nan Gong Yuching, Wan Lingkong! Long time no see!” Diao Dezhu smiled, rushing toward them.

“Alas, I’ve been bored to death these days. Zhanbiao here is only good for eating and being a mute, while Long Jie is someone I can’t even handle. I’ve had no one to talk to!” Upon seeing them, Diao Dezhu spoke without pause, as if reuniting with family.

As they chatted and laughed, they approached Luotian, pulling him up and leading him toward the Demon Clan’s gates, leaving Yan Hongtao behind.

“Damn!” Yan Hongtao muttered, trailing behind Luotian’s group. He truly had no acquaintances here and found the Demon Clan dull.

“Hey, Yan! We’re not even acquainted. Why are you following us? And aren’t we enemies?” Diao Dezhu scolded Yan Hongtao, who ignored him.

“I don’t know anyone here. Though we are enemies, at least we’ve met!” Yan Hongtao smiled, unfazed by Diao Dezhu’s words.

“Want to meet people? Look at those sects’ Sage Princes—they’d be eager to flatter you. It’s easy to meet people, so stop following us!” Diao Dezhu scoffed at Yan Hongtao.

“Do they even deserve to stand beside me?” Yan Hongtao’s gaze flashed with contempt, scanning the group before still following Luotian.

Yan Hongtao’s words were bold and loud, instantly causing the young Sage Princes to flush red with embarrassment. Their expressions turned angry.

They were figures of note in the Divine Beast Domain, yet now they had been openly belittled by Yan Hongtao and Diao Dezhu. Their anger was palpable.

“Hmph,不服气? Want to kill me?” Yan Hongtao gazed at the gathered Sage Princes, his disdain growing.

Diao Dezhu, Zheng Xin, and Gu Lei—all troublemakers—saw the situation and their eyes gleamed.

“Ah, you’re so polite. You wouldn’t dare to be so bold in front of us!” Diao Dezhu spoke, his tone laced with mockery.

“Exactly! If you’re so strong, why are you afraid of Shura Domain? Just take it and fight!” Zheng Xin and Gu Lei mocked the Sage Princes.

“Boom…” The words of Gu Lei and Zheng Xin ignited the young Sage Princes.

“You dare to compare yourselves with us?” one of them sneered.

“Exactly! A backwater domain dares to show off before us!” others added.

“Haha, the Divine Beast Domain is a major domain. How dare they let themselves be insulted like this? If it were us from the Four Sacred Star Domains, we’d just take them down!” Gu Lei and Zheng Xin retorted.

“Who says we don’t dare to speak up?” one of the Sage Princes snapped, turning their ire toward Yan Hongtao.

“Ah, now that’s more like it. Though you’ve got courage, your intelligence and strength are lacking!” Yan Hongtao’s eyes flashed with coldness. A streak of blood-red energy shot toward the Sage Prince who had insulted him.

“Crack…” The next moment, Yan Hongtao’s blood-red hand clamped around the Sage Prince’s throat, emitting a sound.

“You…” The Sage Prince managed only one word before being lifted into the air, his face flushed red.

“Spare me! We are from the Four象 Building of the Divine Beast Domain. Our sect’s elder has some connection with your domain master!” A late Sage level elder approached Yan Hongtao, his face respectful.

“Oh, the Four象 Building?” Yan Hongtao recalled. He had heard of such a sect and released the Sage Prince back to the elder.

“Fine, this time I’ll let it slide. Next time, don’t test my patience!” Yan Hongtao sneered and stood his ground.

The surrounding Sage Princes, now realizing the chasm between themselves and Yan Hongtao’s prodigious talent, turned pale. They had barely seen his attack.

“Alas, having a powerful faction behind you is convenient,” Luotian shook his head, recalling how the sects had once looked down on him.

“Enough. Let’s go,” Luotian said, leading the group into the Demon Clan. Nan Gong Yuching accompanied them throughout, as his task was to guide these young sect disciples.

Nan Gong Yuching led them to a pavilion and then left hurriedly, leaving the group to their own devices.

“Haha, being a Sage Prince isn’t easy,” Diao Dezhu remarked, watching Nan Gong Yuching rush away. He felt fortunate that the幽冥鬼貂 clan had only him as their elder.

“Nan Gong Yuching seems to have been busy these days. It’s tough on him, having to force a smile while keeping a cold face,” Wan Lingkong said with a mocking tone.

“By the way, did you see Xu Liziyi in the Celestial Beast Domain?” Luotian asked Diao Dezhu and Long Jie.

“Brother didn’t come back with you to the Four Sacred Star Domains?” Chen Zhanbiao asked, his voice gruff. He grabbed a piece of meat from the pavilion table and began eating.

“Uh…” Wan Lingkong was taken aback, his face flushing with embarrassment as he lowered his head.

“He was lost in transmission. It said it went to the Celestial Beast Domain, so we assumed he’d gone looking for you! We never thought he would go elsewhere!” Zheng Xin looked puzzled.

“Indeed. It makes sense for him to look for you, so why did he not?” Gu Lei frowned slightly, causing the others’ brows to furrow.

“Boom!” Chen Zhanbiao hurled his meat onto the table, turning to Wan Lingkong with a glare.

“I only know it went into the Celestial Beast Domain, but I don’t know where exactly!” Wan Lingkong shrugged helplessly.

“I’ll kill you!” Chen Zhanbiao, upon hearing Wan Lingkong’s words, suddenly lunged forward like a beast. His black hand shot toward Wan Lingkong.

Though Chen Zhanbiao was straightforward and slow to grasp subtleties, the implication in their words was clear: Xu Liziyi might be in danger, and Wan Lingkong was the culprit. Though Chen Zhanbiao and Wan Lingkong were close, it was Xu Liziyi and Luotian that were his taboos.

“Zhanbiao, let go of me! You’re about to crush me!” Wan Lingkong cried as Chen Zhanbiao lifted him into the air, his body cracking.

“Zhanbiao, stop!” Luotian barked at Chen Zhanbiao, his voice laced with reprimand and a darkened expression.

“Ah!” No one could stop Chen Zhanbiao, but Luotian’s words made him comply. He gently placed Wan Lingkong on the ground and looked at Luotian.

“Remember, no matter what, you must not attack your brothers!” Luotian’s voice was stern as he looked at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Sorry! I lost control!” Chen Zhanbiao bowed respectfully to Wan Lingkong, his eyes filled with regret.

“I know you’re angry. If it makes you feel better, I’ll even kneel and apologize!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke awkwardly, his innocent expression making it hard for the others to stay angry.

“Damn it, cough… you really wanted to kill me!” Wan Lingkong coughed twice. He knew Chen Zhanbiao was impulsive, but this wasn’t the first time. If it weren’t for Luotian’s presence, he might have died today—what a cruel fate.

Chapter 1078: Top-tier Prodigies

Within the Demon Clan, everything was lively. The native forces of the Divine Beast Domain and other major sects from the Nine Domains had all arrived to attend the Demon Clan’s ritual.

On a mountain peak designated for young prodigies, people came and went. Yet one pavilion had become a forbidden zone—no one dared to approach the three seated within.

Luotian sat in the pavilion, his gaze solemn as he watched Chen Zhanbiao, who looked like a child caught in wrongdoing. He sighed softly: “Zhanbiao, remember—no matter what, never attack your brothers!”

“I know I was wrong! Let me hit you twice!” Chen Zhanbiao muttered, his eyes filled with regret as he gazed at Wan Lingkong.

“Ha!” Wan Lingkong let out a laugh, watching Chen Zhanbiao’s pitiful expression.

“Don’t act cute!” Wan Lingkong slapped Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulder, but his palm turned red.

“You bastard! What did you eat to grow so strong?” Wan Lingkong blew on his palm, a smile on his face. He hadn’t taken the incident seriously—Chen Zhanbiao’s nature was well-known.

To put it kindly, he was straightforward; to put it harshly, he had no brains. Trying to explain logic to him would be like preaching to a cow.

“Haha, alright, alright. Don’t worry—Xu Liziyi is a sly bastard and will definitely be fine!” Zheng Xin laughed, addressing the group.

“Come on, let’s eat! It’s been a while since we’ve all gathered. Let’s talk for three days and nights, hahaha!” With Zheng Xin and others lightening the mood, the pavilion became lively again. Laughter echoed across the mountain.

Yan Hongtao stood in a corner, watching Luotian and his companions. A flicker of loneliness passed through his eyes—killers were always alone, their path forged through blood. Seeing Luotian’s group, Yan Hongtao felt a string within him pluck. He shook his head and took a large gulp of wine, sitting in silence.

Luotian and the others truly stayed for three days and nights in the pavilion. Zheng Xin and Gu Lei never stopped talking, their conversation lively.

The Demon Clan’s ritual was in full preparation. Almost every notable sect from the Divine Beast Domain had arrived, and other domains were gradually sending their strength. The crowd marveled at the Demon Clan’s status in the Nine Domains, which was on par with a sacred clan.

On the third day, Luotian and his group still lingered in the pavilion. Two young figures appeared before them, greeted by the respectful gazes of the Divine Beast Domain’s disciples.

“Haha, Lu Xiong, it has been days since we last met. Your风采 remains unchanged! Everyone, long time no see!” Starlight flickered as Zhou Weilin, the Starry Domain’s Sage Prince, approached the pavilion and greeted them.

Sun Feiwen followed Zhou Weilin with the crowd’s flattery, his arrogance evident. One glance at him made people want to slap his face.

“Sun Feiwen!” Upon Sun Feiwen’s appearance, Zheng Xin and others’ expressions darkened. They had a history of conflict with him in the Celestial Beast Domain, their gazes filled with hostility.

“Dream Lady didn’t come?” Luotian smiled and patted Sun Feiwen’s shoulder. After the incident of robbing Zhang Kemin, their relationship had become relatively amicable.

Zheng Xin and Gu Lei saw Luotian’s attitude toward Sun Feiwen, their confusion evident. Yet their hostility toward him had lessened.

“Dream Lady has some matters and couldn’t come,” Sun Feiwen said, his voice natural. Even Luotian didn’t notice the fleeting trace of sorrow in his eyes.

“Zhou Xiong, no harm done!” Luotian didn’t dwell on it. After all, this was the Demon Clan’s ritual; Dream Lady’s aversion to such events was understandable. He turned and greeted Zhou Weilin.

“Everyone has arrived—Starry Domain, Divine Beast Domain, Shura Domain, Four Sacred Star Domains! The strongest Sage Princes from these domains have all come!” The crowd marveled at Luotian’s group, their expressions filled with admiration.

These individuals were the top prodigies of the Nine Domains. Each had extraordinary talent and achievements, having defeated others through reverse penalties or overpowered kills. Especially Luotian, Yan Hongtao, and the others, they were undoubtedly the strongest among these prodigies.

“Dragged here by our domain master. But seeing you all, I know this trip to the Divine Beast Domain was worth it!” Zhou Weilin surveyed Luotian’s group, admiration in his eyes. Especially when he saw Yan Hongtao, a smile graced his face.

“Come in!” Luotian led Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin into the pavilion. He marveled at their strength, even Yan Hongtao had reached late Sage level.

“Hmph. Want to sit here? Let me see if you deserve it—whether you’re just hot air!” As Luotian and the others took their first steps, Yan Hongtao appeared before them. His aura surged with battle intent as he blocked their path.

“Yan Hongtao, are you going to attack us?” Sun Feiwen’s gaze darkened. Though Yan Hongtao was at late Sage level, he met Sun Feiwen’s gaze without fear. His aura rose steadily.

“Yan Xiong, it has been a while. Your hostility is still as strong as ever. I knew this trip to the Divine Beast Domain wouldn’t be a leisurely one. Speak up, I’ll accept it!” Zhou Weilin smiled lightly, his tone indifferent but radiating confidence.

“Damn it, Yan. You sound like you’re the host here. It was you who followed us—don’t take it as an honor that we didn’t chase you away. You really think you’re one of us?” Diao Dezhu spoke, his tone laced with impatience.

“Because I followed you in, I didn’t trouble you!” Yan Hongtao’s gaze remained fixed on Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin.

“Enough. Don’t interfere—this is entertainment! I suspect those old men won’t let us sit idle!” Luotian shook his head gently at Zheng Xin and others.

“Hmph, four top prodigies are about to clash. These four have the potential to become Epoch Lords in the future. Watching them fight will be a valuable story for their later glory!” The Divine Beast Domain’s Sage Princes watched with envy and bitterness. They were prodigies themselves, but in this era of prodigies, they would inevitably become stepping stones for these others’ brilliance.

“Receive my three palms. If you can withstand them, you have the right to sit here; otherwise, leave!” Yan Hongtao glared coldly. Blood energy swirled around him.

“Don’t talk about three palms—thirty would still be nothing to you!” Sun Feiwen, clearly annoyed by Yan Hongtao’s arrogance, spoke loudly. His body radiated golden light as he stood still, awaiting Yan Hongtao’s attack.

“Come on!” Zhou Weilin was direct. Starlight flickered around him, giving him an ethereal aura even in daylight.

“Pleasant!” Yan Hongtao laughed, his hands striking out. Blood-red palms slammed toward Zhou Weilin and Sun Feiwen.

“Even this strength? You think you can suppress me?” Sun Feiwen scoffed, his body wrapped in golden light. His palm rose like a god descending from heaven, colliding with Yan Hongtao’s blood-red palm.

Meanwhile, another pair of hands—green—solidified and met Yan Hongtao’s other hand.

Three people, six palms. In the crowd’s stunned gaze, they collided with a thunderous explosion, as if two lightning bolts had struck the mountain peak. The entire mountain trembled.

Invisible waves battered their bodies, yet they stood unmoving, locking eyes with each other. Their battle intent grew even stronger.

Luotian stood before them, his gaze filled with admiration. None of the three were inferior to him. He knew they had not used their full strength—after all, domain masters were present on this mountain. Respect for the Demon Clan was necessary.

“First palm—just an appetizer. I’ll use my full strength for the second! Shura’s Third Palm!” Yan Hongtao spoke, his eyes flashing red.

“Hum…” A humming sound echoed from Yan Hongtao’s body. His overwhelming blood energy instantly invaded the minds of those around him, making Luotian feel slightly uncomfortable.

A crimson palm formed slowly, resembling a Shura’s hand. Wails of souls echoed from it before dissolving into the palm.

“Used full strength? This is more like it! Divine Hand!” Sun Feiwen laughed, golden light flashing. His entire arm swelled as he formed a palm of unbreakable might, colliding with Yan Hongtao’s crimson palm.

Zhou Weilin remained smiling. Green seals formed into stars, bursting from his eyes and wrapping around his hands.

“Boom… Boom…” In Luotian’s awe, the three palms collided again. The deafening sound echoed across the mountain, and the entire peak was reduced to rubble.

Chapter 1079: Chaos Domain

On the Demon Clan’s mountain, two powerful explosions echoed. The pavilion where Luotian and his group were located was completely destroyed, its structures reduced to dust before the onlookers.

As the smoke cleared, three figures appeared. Yan Hongtao’s body was wreathed in blood energy, his eyes filled with excitement as he gazed at Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin.

“Powerful! These three were merely sparring, yet their strength is already this formidable. If they fought to the death, who would be the strongest?” The crowd marveled at Yan Hongtao standing proudly. They could sense that one palm from the three would be enough to kill a mid-Sage level being—let alone these mid-Sage level figures.

“Excellent!” Yan Hongtao smiled, gazing at Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin who remained unscathed.

“Who is the strongest among them? Their appearances show no change!” The crowd watched the three, waiting for their third palm.

“Probably Yan Hongtao. After all, he is at late Sage level and fought two opponents—his strength should be slightly superior!” One person suggested.

“Or it could be Sun Feiwen. As the Celestial Beast Domain’s Sage Prince, he received the Celestial Clan’s true teachings—his rank among these people is no issue!” Another countered.

“Such power? You think you can fight two against me?” Sun Feiwen scoffed, golden light flashing. He did not retreat but instead launched another attack with his golden palm, radiating supreme divine might and leaving sparks in the air.

Meanwhile, Zhou Weilin also launched his third palm. Starry energy flickered as a black sky descended, stars falling and colliding with his hands before breaking into a palm of overwhelming might, striking Yan Hongtao.

“Shura’s Third Palm!” Yan Hongtao remained fearless. His hands summoned endless blood energy, a crimson beast materializing around him before striking both Zhou Weilin and Sun Feiwen.

A wave of shock spread across the mountain, drawing everyone’s attention. Their gazes were fixed on this peak as they filled it with divine senses, eager to witness the outcome of their clash.

Luotian stood near them, his gaze filled with solemnity. He could feel the overwhelming waves from their third palm—this was no mere play, but a true battle to decide victory. Even he would have to fight with all his might.

“Haha, I’ll test the Shura Domain’s Yan Sage Prince! What makes him so special?” Just as their palms were about to collide, a light laugh echoed from afar. A streak of gray energy swept through their perception.

A line of gray light sliced through the void, appearing between the three just as they were about to clash. A palm of gray energy, capable of devouring all things, struck Yan Hongtao’s red palm.

“Daring to die?” The crowd gasped, their faces turning pale as they gazed at the figure cloaked in gray energy.

“Who is this person? Daring to be so arrogant, leaving his back exposed to Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin!” Zheng Xin and others narrowed their eyes. They had not expected anyone to be so bold.

“Truly foolish!” Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin’s eyes flashed with coldness. This person’s actions clearly showed they did not regard them as threats, believing they could not harm him.

Realizing this, the two intensified their palms, increasing their power before striking the gray figure.

“Be careful!” Luotian saw Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin’s coldness and knew they had decided to kill the gray figure. He activated his Shadow Demon Step, filling his body with divine power before concentrating it in his hands.

This was the Demon Clan’s ritual. The gray figure was clearly no ordinary person. If he were killed here, it would surely trigger a war among the sacred domains. Domain masters would also intervene, and the Demon Clan would inevitably be caught in the crossfire. To protect Elder Nan Gong Bo’s position as clan leader, Luotian had no choice but to intercept their attack.

“Luotian!” Zheng Xin and others widened their eyes. They had not expected Luotian to suddenly intervene, blocking Sun Feiwen and Zhou Weilin’s attack on the gray figure.

In the back mountains of the Demon Clan, several elders bore expressions of admiration. Their gazes were deep and contemplative.

If anyone saw them, they would be stunned—these three were none other than the domain masters of the Nine Domains. They were semi-Epoch level beings.

“This five will surely claim a place in the future struggle for the Epoch Lord title,” an elder in green robes spoke. He was the Starry Domain’s domain master, Zhou Tianxing.

“Yet it remains to be seen who will be the strongest. Though these five do not represent all prodigies, they are certainly among the top ten in the Nine Domains,” a middle-aged man in white imperial robes spoke. Younger than others, his aura radiated authority. He was the Celestial Clan’s Divine King, Sun Shengtian.

“Still, some are missing. For instance, the Celestial Clan’s ‘Primordial Body’ and your hidden treasure—your son with the ‘Eternal Immortal Body’! A clan with two divine bodies will never decline, even without an Epoch Lord,” the Demon Lord said, a hint of helplessness in his gaze as he looked at the Divine King.

Compared to the Celestial Clan, the Demon Clan was far less prosperous. The only one they could boast of now was Nan Gong Yuching.
