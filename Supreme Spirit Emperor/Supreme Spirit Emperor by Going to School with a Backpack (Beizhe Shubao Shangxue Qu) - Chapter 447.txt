At the very moment the crimson spear shot forth, Luo Tian's mouth gushed blood as if it were free of cost, his face pale as a sheet of paper, and his aura had weakened considerably.

This time, Luo Tian truly had wounded himself at the core; he felt his qi and blood had been drained significantly.

"Is it Luo Tian..." Just as Luo Tian managed to push the crimson spear away, the people of Lei Domain's great battle had all arrived at the outskirts of Star-Weaving Domain. They gazed upon the figure radiating golden light amidst the endless darkness, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Damn it, it's him! It's really him!" The royal heirs of the clan and the prodigies gritted their teeth, their gazes filled with resentment as they looked toward Luo Tian, and also beheld the hovering Heavenly Dao Mark, their eyes brimming with insatiable longing.

Chapter 1740: The Battle for Enlightenment

"Indeed it's Luo Tian!" The people of the Human Race bore expressions of joy, gazing upon the towering figure of a thousand zhang, exclaiming in astonishment.

"Haha! The Human Race shall produce another Epoch Lord once more! What qualifications do the Ancient Clans possess to invade our Human Race!" The people of the Human Race erupted into frenzied excitement, their voices filled with exhilaration. At this moment, the Human Race had finally lifted its head high.

"Indeed, they did not disappoint us!" Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin's robes were stained with blood, their faces carrying a faint smile, their eyes also reflecting a sense of satisfaction.

"Ultimately, they were just one step ahead of us," Yan Xiuluo, Zhu Gejie, and Sun Feiwen's eyes carried a bitter expression. Though they had anticipated this outcome beforehand, seeing it now still stirred an ache in their hearts.

Meanwhile, Wang Wang, Jun Wulei, and Zhu Geqingtian's royal heirs bore complex expressions as they gazed upon Luo Tian standing there.

"Perhaps it's too early to celebrate; perhaps he might be killed by the Heavenly Tempest next. Then, the Heavenly Dao Mark would become an unclaimed treasure!" The royal heir of the clan sneered, his gaze fixed upon the Heavenly Dao Mark, a glint of greed in his eyes.

"Indeed, the Heavenly Dao Mark is unclaimed. If we could obtain it, we too could attain enlightenment!" The clan's prodigies and royal heirs bore expressions of excitement as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Yet there's not only the Heavenly Tempest, but also a human trial!" Gu Tianshu furrowed his brows and sighed deeply, exchanging glances with Dong Boxin. The two took a step forward, standing before the crowd.

At this moment, Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin believed that everyone must be guarded against. After all, facing the Heavenly Dao Mark, no one could remain unmoved—even the prodigies of the Nine Domains were no exception.

"Have they all arrived?" Luo Tian panted heavily, sensing their arrival. Upon seeing the bloodstains on their bodies, his eyes turned icy.

Especially when he saw Gu Tianshu's chest bearing a wound that had yet to heal, his gaze filled with murderous intent toward the Ancient Clans.

With a single glance piercing through space, all of the Ancient Clans shivered involuntarily.

"Buzz..." However, as the clans trembled in fear, waves of energy once again emanated from beneath the dark starry sky. This time, a translucent face materialized and exhaled, sending forth waves of immortal energy from the illusory mouth.

Immortal energy surged; in an instant, a figure radiating golden light appeared before Luo Tian. His eyes carried authority, and his aura exuded a power that overshadowed heaven and earth.

"This... is the King of my Crimson Roc Clan!" Old Crimson Roc's face bore astonishment as he gazed upon the figure radiating golden light, exclaiming in disbelief.

"Buzz..." The waves resumed, and a figure radiating gray energy appeared as well, exuding an aura of depth. It stood amidst the heavens and earth.

"The King of the Mortal Clan..." Old Crimson Roc's words had barely finished when the people of the Mortal Clan erupted into excitement, their eyes alight with exhilaration.

Waves of energy continued to spread outward, and one by one, figures appeared before Luo Tian. A total of eighteen figures stood there—nine were Kings of the Ancient Clans, and nine were Epoch Lords of the Human Race.

"Damn it, are they trying to kill me?" Luo Tian gazed upon the eighteen figures formed from immortal energy, his mind cursing. Each of these individuals felt overwhelmingly powerful to him.

Among them, Luo Tian recognized some—such as the figure radiating blood energy, who was none other than Blood Lord Tu Tian from the Infinite Blood Sea.

There was also the King of Star-Moon Divine Clan, whom Luo Tian had once seen in a statue within the Star-Moon Divine Clan.

"These illusions are not at his peak, but they still possess nearly thirty percent of his strength!" Zhu Geqingtian gazed upon the middle-aged man in green robes, a wistful look in his eyes.

"This is an absolute kill," Zhu Geqingtian murmured, "I heard that my father only manifested nine at the time of his cultivation trial. Yet Luo Tian has nearly doubled that!"

"Indeed, I've heard my father say the same," other Epoch Lords' royal heirs echoed, causing a shadow to fall over the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

As they spoke, the eighteen former supreme beings moved forward, their auras surging into the heavens as they charged toward Luo Tian.

"Kill..." Luo Tian knew that only by enduring could he survive; otherwise, with the Heavenly Dao's nature toward him, it would not grant him even a chance of survival. To live, he had to defy the heavens.

"If one wishes to become an immortal, they must first defy the heavens!" Luo Tian's mind echoed with Gu Tianshu's words as his aura surged again.

At the very moment Luo Tian and the eighteen supreme beings moved, the Heavenly Dao Mark hovering in the dark starry sky emitted waves of light. Invisible ripples spread outward, as if altering some rule, and sent out a call for possession.

"We can also vie for it!" The ripples resonated within everyone's minds, causing joy to bloom on their faces.

"This is the heavens themselves wishing Luo Tian dead!" The royal heirs and prodigies of the clan laughed, their laughter filled with intense excitement.

"Is this truly what must come to pass?" Gu Tianshu muttered lowly, gazing at Luo Tian who was now clashing with the eighteen supreme beings. His hand gripped his divine sword, which flared with radiant light again.

"Clear a path of blood for the royal heirs!" Eight great beings who had lived through their second lives from the Ancient Clan of Kings bore fierce glares, their eyes fixed upon Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin.

"Who dares to block me?" The King of the Crimson Roc Clan, Jin Xiyang, roared and charged toward Luo Tian.

"Kill..." Frenzied, almost instantly, all the royal heirs and prodigies of the clan went mad. Faced with such a temptation as attaining enlightenment, no one could remain sane.

"Repel them!" The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains also roared, standing behind Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin.

Du Hongxi and Ma Xiuzhen bore faint smiles, standing beside Gu Tianshu's group. They were not particularly concerned about the Heavenly Dao Mark; after all, they originally belonged to the Immortal Realm. The Heavenly Dao realm was not impossible for them.

The Ancient Clans and the Nine Domains retreated, knowing that even the edge of the Shura Domain would become a battlefield. The residual waves from Gu Tianshu's battle were beyond their capacity to withstand.

"Gu Tianshu, move aside! The Heavenly Dao Mark is ours!" A great being who had lived through their second life roared, their aura overwhelming and completely mad. They could imagine that if Luo Tian became an Epoch Lord, the Ancient Clans would have no chance of recovery.

"With me here, you won't take a single step forward!" Gu Tianshu's long hair fluttered as he held his golden divine sword, standing at the forefront of the crowd and speaking loudly.

"You truly think we fear you? Do you know that within the Burial of Immortals, we didn't just enhance our strength but also refined a great deal of immortal energy!" Several second-life great beings spoke aloud, their hands moving as waves of immortal energy shot forth from them.

Meanwhile, the clan's prodigies and royal heirs stood there, watching coldly. At this moment, they were not suitable for action; they needed to adjust themselves to their peak state to vie for the Heavenly Dao Mark.

Those who believed they could not attain enlightenment, like other princes of the Crimson Roc Clan, knew that in this life, they could not contend with Luo Tian and others. Thus, they all launched attacks toward Diao Dezhu and others.

The battle erupted again, but Luo Tian did not immediately concern himself with Gu Tianshu's fight. The eighteen Epoch Lords posed such a massive pressure that each attack forced him to retreat, his body emitting crackling sounds.

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared continuously; the Wheel of Reincarnation within his dantian thundered, and the blood within his body seemed to have ascended.

"Truly变态!" People gazed at Luo Tian, who despite being on the defensive, still resisted the attacks of eighteen supreme beings. Their eyes bore admiration.

"Buzz..." On another side, waves of immortal energy spread from the clan's hands, colliding above their heads.

"Gu Tianshu, have you ever seen immortal energy?" The clan's people bore a proud expression as they gazed at Gu Tianshu and his group.

"Roar..." Waves of immortal energy coalesced into a primordial beast, radiating overwhelming waves as it charged toward Gu Tianshu's group.

"Immortal energy! My clan's great beings actually possess it!" The people of the clans were stunned, gazing at the beast resembling an immortal creature as it roared toward Gu Tianshu's group.

"Immortal energy? What's so special about it?" Seeing the primordial beast formed from immortal energy, Long Jie and others bore disdain. Their auras flared out, releasing terrifying power from their hands.

"Buzz..." The humming echoed again as waves of immortal energy shot forth from Long Jie's group, forming a storm that swept toward the primordial beast.

"Roar..." In an instant, the roar of the beast was deafening; however, it was instantly annihilated by the storm conjured by Long Jie and Du Hongxi. The immortal energy vortex also swept toward the clan's people.

"Damn it, where did they get so much immortal energy!" The clan's people bore terror as the storm of immortal energy swept toward them, their senses overwhelmed by its apocalyptic power. They had never imagined that the people of the Human Race could have such an opportunity.

"Buzz..." Glowing lights of various colors flickered, and a series of divine weapons shot forth from the group's hands. They cast radiant light, enveloping everyone in a halo of divine brilliance.

Chapter 1741: Gu Tianshu's Injury

"Boom..." Tremendous power surged before the Ancient Clans' people, causing them to spit blood and gape in disbelief as they retreated.

"Although we also wish to vie, it's better to first deal with these pests. Our quarrel is an internal matter of the Human Race!" Wang Wang and others shouted, their auras resplendent as they charged toward the Ancient Clan's people.

"Kill..." The Ancient Clans gazed at Wang Wang and others charging toward them, their faces filled with cruelty. At this moment, they had no path to retreat; if Luo Tian attained enlightenment, they would inevitably be suppressed by him and have no chance of rising.

A brutal battle erupted again in the starry sky, but this time it had shifted from the Lei Domain to the Shura Domain. The battle was even more brutal than before.

"Boom..." At this moment, Luo Tian also faced a life-or-death crisis; the eighteen Kings and near-Epoch Lords brought immense pressure, forcing him to retreat with each attack. Blood gushed from his mouth continuously.

"Damn it, what a massive setup! Anyone would die!" Luo Tian cursed in his mind as he clashed with Blood Lord Tu Tian. He then moved swiftly, being struck on the back by a spear from the Star-Weaving Domain's King. Other attacks also came like lightning, striking him repeatedly.

"You truly have your true self here; I would be wary of it a little, but you only possess thirty percent of its strength. Though your current power is formidable, it's still not enough!" Luo Tian roared continuously as his aura surged with overwhelming power. The Wheel of Reincarnation within his dantian radiated waves of immortal energy, which he activated.

"Vajra Attack!" Luo Tian bellowed, and a golden ancient palace manifested in his hands. The divine aura was overwhelming, radiating supreme power that made the entire Star-Weaving Domain tremble.

"Has Luo Tian completed his transformation? His martial arts are all formed from immortal energy!" People's minds were filled with awe, including Gu Tianshu and others locked in combat against several second-life great beings. Their eyes also bore expressions of awe.

"Thankfully, the Heavenly Tempest has restrained him; otherwise, he alone could have pushed us all aside!" People spoke in hushed tones as they gazed at the ancient palace formed from immortal energy.

Divine power surged; the golden palace descended upon the eighteen Epoch Lords and Kings, radiating supreme pressure.

"Buzz..." The eighteen individuals instantly unleashed divine laws to counter the ancient palace, generating immense pressure.

"Vajra's Wrath!" Luo Tian's robes fluttered as he took a step forward, his foot landing upon the ancient palace.

"Buzz..." Strange phenomena arose; chains of immortal energy shot forth from the ancient palace, and two invisible waves clashed between Luo Tian and the eighteen individuals. Though it seemed silent, the ferocity was unparalleled; whoever lost would be crushed by the opponent's aura.

At the same time, the battle on another side had reached a fever pitch.

On one hand, Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin each faced three opponents; on the other hand, Du Hongxi, Ma Xiuzhen, and Guan Yuxin faced two second-life great beings from the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan) and Star-Moon Divine Clan—those who had made a pact with Luo Tian.

In fact, these two clans had never fought at full strength from the beginning; otherwise, if they had unleashed their full power, perhaps the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Human Race would have already been occupied by the clans.

However, they had no regrets; especially after witnessing Luo Tian summoning the Heavenly Dao Tempest, they knew their initial decision was correct.

The rewards of their sacrifices had now doubled; if Luo Tian attained enlightenment, other clans might have difficulties, but these two would not face major issues.

Others also found their opponents; however, besides Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin, others easily dominated due to their numerical advantage.

"Damn it, Gu Tianshu, you're seeking death!" Seeing Luo Tian clashing with the eighteen Epoch Lords and Kings, the faces of several near-kings bore madness.

At this moment, the Heavenly Dao Mark hovered there; whoever could seize it would have a chance to attain enlightenment.

Yet Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin stood like two mountains, blocking them out. Though they were in a desperate situation, they managed to turn danger into safety each time, inflicting wounds upon their opponents.

"Use our final means; otherwise, if that kid recovers and refines the Heavenly Dao Mark, none of us will survive!" Several second-life great beings whispered to each other.

"Unexpectedly, these two are so strong; they could be considered the top among Epoch Lords!"

"No, it's the second place. The first is that Luo Tian!" They thought to themselves and nodded, preparing to unleash their final secret weapon.

With that in mind, they formed hand signs continuously, and waves of divine seals appeared on their hands.

"Buzz..." The humming echoed again as the divine seals fused together, turning black.

A dark chain of divine seals appeared beneath the starry sky, exuding a mysterious and powerful aura. A small black sword emerged into view.

The small black sword, though not large, contained overwhelming power, as if nothing in the world could withstand it.

"What is this..." Seeing the small black sword, Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin's pale faces turned even graver.

"Gu Tianshu, I had planned to reveal this at the last moment, against Ji Jiuyou. Now that Ji Jiuyou hasn't appeared, it's only for you!" A second-life great being of the Blood Clan bore a mocking expression as he spoke to Gu Tianshu and Dong Boxin, whose faces had turned grim.

"It's that sword!" Luo Tian stood beneath the ancient palace; upon seeing the small black sword, his face turned grim. Even as he clashed with the eighteen supreme beings, his aura trembled slightly.

"It's the sword from the Burial of Immortals!" Luo Tian's mind was in turmoil, sensing a great danger from the small black sword. Nothing could make him feel threatened except this small black sword, which had been in the Burial of Immortals. He had once attempted to claim it but failed.

How could he have anticipated that the Ancient Clans would bring this sword out? It left him in absolute shock.

"Although it's strong, we still need to block it!" Gu Tianshu glanced at Luo Tian clashing with the eighteen supreme beings, a faint smile on his face.

That glance made Luo Tian's heart tremble; for the first time, he saw an expression of determination in Gu Tianshu's eyes—something he had never seen before on Gu Tianshu.

"This is a lower-grade divine weapon!" Du Hongxi and others gazed at the small black sword, exclaiming in astonishment. Their eyes bore disbelief.

They had naturally seen lower-grade divine weapons before, so they could recognize the grade of this small black sword.

"How is it possible? In the three thousand small worlds, how could there be divine weapons? What kind of small world are we in?" People spoke in disbelief.

"Die!" Before people could react, several second-life great beings combined their power and activated the small black sword.

"Buzz..." Black energy erupted from the small sword, cold yet authoritative, causing Gu Tianshu's eyes to narrow slightly.

"Come on!" Gu Tianshu gazed at the black sword's tip aimed at him, his eyes filled with battle spirit. His white robes fluttered without wind, stained with bloodstains that looked like blooming crimson plum blossoms.

Before people could react, the small black sword pierced through space and vanished from their sight.

"Crack..." Waves of black lightning rose before Gu Tianshu, the sword crossing the sky. Golden swords clashed with the small black sword.

"Could he block it! No wonder Gu Tianshu is so strong!" Everyone's minds were shocked as they watched Gu Tianshu retreat a few steps.

"Crack..." However, people then gasped in shock; Gu Tianshu's golden sword was shattered directly before their eyes, scattering into divine laws that floated around him.

"Spit..." The small black sword did not slow down, rushing toward Gu Tianshu's abdomen. People's hearts were on edge again.

In the blink of an eye, the small black sword rushed toward Gu Tianshu's abdomen. Gu Tianshu's mouth spat blood.

"Die!" The three second-life great beings of the clan bore cruel expressions as they activated the small black sword.

"Stop..." Gu Tianshu spat blood, and at the moment the small black sword moved, he grabbed it with his hand, blocking it.

"Severely wounded!" People watched Gu Tianshu standing there, his body straight, their eyes filled with awe. They had never imagined that the small black sword could not kill Gu Tianshu.

"Get out of my way..." Gu Tianshu roared, his robe flapped, and with both arms, he pulled out the small black sword that had pierced into his abdomen.

"Cough cough..." The small black sword flew from Gu Tianshu's hands, and blood gushed out of his abdomen. Black mist surrounded the fierce wound.

"Grandmaster Gu!" Luo Tian stood atop the ancient palace, his eyes nearly bleeding as he watched Grandmaster Gu, who was still radiating an undefeated aura despite being stained with blood. He roared.

Chapter 1742: Those Who Harm My Disciple Shall Perish

"Grandmaster Gu!" Luo Tian's heart trembled as he watched Grandmaster Gu still standing there. In Luo Tian's eyes, Grandmaster Gu had always been an invincible figure; however, from the resolute gaze in Grandmaster Gu's eyes just now, Luo Tian had seen deep concern.

"How many more can you endure?" Seeing one strike had severely wounded Grandmaster Gu, the others' faces bore joy.

"Back then, you alone could suppress us to the point of suffocation; what a mighty presence. Did you ever imagine that today would come?" They laughed joyfully, for years they had dreamed of this moment. Now it was finally realized.

"Kill..." On another side, Dong Boxin, seeing Grandmaster Gu wounded, erupted with a terrifying aura. He punched repeatedly, subduing the three second-life great beings who had surrounded him.

"You should be more cautious!" Seeing Dong Boxin go mad, the three second-life great beings laughed and activated the small black sword toward Dong Boxin.

Its speed broke through the limits of the Nine Domains, and in an instant, the small black sword appeared before Dong Boxin, rushing toward his back.

At the moment they activated the small black sword, Dong Boxin felt a strong sense of danger. He desperately turned his body and was pierced through the shoulder, emerging from his back.

"Cough cough..." A black wound appeared on Dong Boxin's shoulder, and his face turned pale.

"What kind of power is this?" After regaining some strength, Diao Yuanshan and others observed the battlefield. Seeing both Grandmaster Gu and Dong Boxin wounded, their hearts sank slightly.

Grandmaster Gu and Dong Boxin were crucial to the Human Race; they were invincible elders, like a pillar of stability for the Human Race. In people's eyes, Grandmaster Gu and Dong Boxin would never lose; as long as they were present, the Human Race would not be destroyed.

But now, these invincible figures of the Nine Domains had been pierced through their bodies by a single sword.

"Want to block him? First, step over my corpse!" Grandmaster Gu's face was pale, his gaze resolute as he looked at the clan.

"Then die!" The clan's people bore joy, again activating the small black sword toward Grandmaster Gu.

"Spit..." Another blood hole appeared on Grandmaster Gu's body, making his face even paler.

"Grandmaster Gu, move aside!" The clan's people shouted loudly, sensing Grandmaster Gu's aura had weakened slightly.

"I won't!" Grandmaster Gu moved his hands slightly, and divine laws appeared before him, then entered his body. His aura surged again.

"Immortal energy..." Seeing Grandmaster Gu's divine laws, people's faces bore shock. Though only a few, the aura of immortal energy he had unleashed was overwhelmingly powerful, matching that of the previous clash with the clan's immortal energy. It seemed to be a fundamental difference.

"Is this his self-cultivated immortal energy?" Du Hongxi and others, who were locked in combat with the two great beings of the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan) and Star-Moon Divine Clan, had a thunderous aura. However, they were unusually easygoing as they watched Grandmaster Gu unleash three divine laws of immortal energy. Their faces bore intense shock.

"My heavens, in the three thousand small worlds, there is someone who can cultivate immortal energy!" Du Hongxi and others spoke loudly, their voices filled with intense disbelief.

"What do you mean by self-cultivated immortal energy? Is there another kind of immortal energy?" Fu Cangshan's face bore confusion as he asked.

"Immortal energy is the foundation of the Immortal Realm; all people in the Immortal Realm cultivate through it. However, some extraordinary individuals have cultivated immortal energy on their own through effort. Compared to the usual method of absorbing and refining it, this self-cultivated immortal energy is much stronger."

"Such individuals are as rare as phoenix feathers in the Immortal Realm! According to what I know, the most famous among them is Tuo Tian's immortal king. His entire cultivation was self-cultivated, without absorbing any immortal energy from the Immortal Realm." Du Hongxi spoke in disbelief, his voice filled with awe. He had never imagined that such a presence could exist within the three thousand small worlds.

"Tuo Tian's immortal king... who is that?" People hearing Du Hongxi's words were astonished. They had never heard of the person he mentioned.

"Anyway, those who can cultivate immortal energy on their own are extremely extraordinary. Even in the Immortal Realm, they would be rare. According to what I know, even the immortal kings might want to take them as disciples and change their fate, allowing them to ascend to the Heavenly Dao realm and embark on a path of cultivation. After all, such people would inevitably become true immortals in the future; perhaps they could even challenge the immortal king realm. Unfortunately, he was born within the three thousand small worlds and lived through a second life, ultimately dying at the end of his lifespan." Guan Yuxin's eyes also bore admiration. If Grandmaster Gu were in the Immortal Realm, he would be a figure to revere.

"Buzz..." As they marveled, the small black sword rushed toward Grandmaster Gu and collided with one of his divine laws.

In an instant, the small black sword was repelled by invisible waves and flew back toward the group.

"This... it has blocked a lower-grade divine weapon!" The clan's people bore great shock, gazing at the small black sword returning to their group and Grandmaster Gu's three divine laws. They could not help but exclaim in disbelief.

"Again!" Though the clan's people were shaken, they soon activated the small black sword again and rushed toward Grandmaster Gu.

"One strike... two strikes..." Waves of dark light continuously rose before Grandmaster Gu, and his body kept retreating. Blood gushed from his mouth like it was free of cost in the starry sky.

"Grandmaster Gu..." People watched Grandmaster Gu become even more desperate, his entire body seemingly having thinned by a few inches.

"There's none left!" People watched Grandmaster Gu's divine laws deplete, their eyes filled with despair as they saw the end of an invincible great being.

"Die!" The three clan's great beings bore exhaustion, obviously having expended much energy in activating the small black sword.

"Buzz..." The small black sword emitted a series of hums, leaving people completely desperate. They could not imagine how Grandmaster Gu could possibly block it again.

"Luo Tian roared into the sky, his blood and qi surging as he gazed with madness. He stepped repeatedly on the golden ancient palace, beginning to burn his blood and qi.

"Crack..." The immense pressure caused the eighteen supreme beings' bodies to emit crackling sounds, momentarily giving Luo Tian the upper hand.

However, Luo Tian could not eliminate them in a short time; he could only watch as the small black sword rushed toward Grandmaster Gu.

The small black sword radiated a terrifying aura, instantly appearing before Grandmaster Gu. Just as it was about to pierce into his body, a radiant light shot forth from Luo Tian's body and flew toward Grandmaster Gu. It collided with the small black sword.

"Crack..." Thunder flashed, and two streams of light—black and blue—disappeared from people's sight.

"Hmm?" Grandmaster Gu furrowed his brows, gazing toward Luo Tian's direction. He found that Luo Tian was also stunned, looking at himself in confusion.

"The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword!" Luo Tian muttered to himself; the radiant light that had shot forth from his body was indeed the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. However, he did not know why it had flown out of his body on its own to block the small black sword's fatal strike.

"What's going on!" The clan's people were stunned, never expecting the small black sword they had considered invincible to be repelled.

"Buzz..." The small black sword returned to the group's heads, but its dark aura had dimmed somewhat. Obviously, the collision had caused some damage to the small black sword.

"Those who harm my disciple shall perish!" A cold voice rang out, and in an instant, four figures with powerful auras appeared before people's eyes.

A senior wearing green robes bore cold glares in his eyes, holding a seven-foot-long sword with four thunder divine laws surrounding it. This was the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword that had shot forth from Luo Tian's body.

Beside him, a senior in blue robes bore admiration, gazing at Luo Tian clashing with the eighteen supreme beings.

A golden-armored monkey held a nine-heavenly-plate dragon staff, radiating overwhelming power.

Another senior bore eyes filled with divine light, a faint smile on his face as he held a lotus seat.

Upon their appearance, the skies of the Shura Domain were illuminated. The powerful auras radiated from the four figures, causing everyone's faces to react with emotion.

"Who are they? How could the Human Race have such figures!" The people of the Human Race bore confusion, while only the Four Sacred Star Domains' people bore excitement.

"Father!" Yan Chen, locked in combat with a King's heir, saw the monkey among the four who resembled him and his face turned excited.

Chapter 1743: Zhang Daotian

Four figures with powerful auras stood beneath the starry sky, and the entire starry sky trembled at their appearance. Even the crimson eyes atop Luo Tian's head flickered slightly.

"Master!" Zhang Ziping and others, locked in combat with the clan's prodigies, bore excitement on their faces as they gazed at the figure with an immortal aura. They spoke in disbelief.

"Father!" Yan Chen's face also bore excitement, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"They've awakened! Finally, they've awakened! Those four elders have finally lived through their second lives!" The people of the Tianyuan Continent spoke in disbelief.

Zhang Daotian, Yan Zun, Xiang Tianming, and Yin Tianxiong—former heroes of the Tianyuan Continent. With their four powers, they had resisted the invasion of the Mortal Domain. Now, they finally appeared before people's eyes.

"Buzz..." The golden staff struck through vast space, smashing into the second-life great being of the Mortal Clan.

Zhang Daotian held the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, appearing like a true immortal, his eyes radiating infinite killing intent. He gazed at the Ancient Clan's people rushing toward Luo Tian, his eyes filled with endless coldness. His Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword radiated waves of light and instantly flew from his hands, forming a cold glint before Qi Hongrui.

"Spit..." Blood flashed; Qi Hongrui's face bore fear, and he was instantly turned into a mist of blood, floating in the starry sky.

"One strike... just one!" Everyone was stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Zhang Daotian beneath the starry sky.

"Boom..." On another side, the golden dragon staff also smashed into the hand of a Mortal Clan's great being. That great being was instantly crushed into flesh and bone by the staff.

"My god, who is this? He's too strong!" Everyone bore expressions of shock as they gazed at Zhang Daotian and Yan Zun standing there.

Two strikes, and Qi Hongrui and the Mortal Clan's great being were turned into a mist of blood. One was clean and neat, the other an ultimate display of violence.

"Haha! This is one of our Tianyuan Continent's great beings!" Zheng Xin and others bore a proud expression as they gazed at everyone, feeling that the scene of Zhang Daotian's four appearing was truly impressive.

"Two elders, you've worked hard!" Zhang Daotian smiled and flew to the front of Grandmaster Gu and Dong Boxin.

"Master..." Luo Tian bore a faint smile, repeatedly stepping on the ancient palace and also noticing Zhang Daotian's group. His heart was filled with joy; he had never imagined that at this critical moment, the four would appear and do so with such strength.

"Indeed, the Tianyuan Continent has such great beings!" The Ancient Clans were stunned, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at the four figures who remained calm. A bad premonition arose in their hearts.

"This is too much!" The people of the clans felt despair, having previously been crushed by Grandmaster Gu and three others like dogs. Now, compared to before, they were even more powerful, having even produced a lower-grade divine weapon. Finally, the Human Race had brought forth four strong figures who immediately defeated two second-life great beings without resistance.

"Crack..." Four colors of thunder erupted from Zhang Daotian's hands, instantly disappearing and surrounding Qi Hongrui's flesh.
