“This time isn’t bad!” A muffled voice echoed through the annihilating tempest, as fragments of stone burst forth from the storm, scattering in all directions. The clattering of stones could be heard endlessly.

“Effective!” Luotian observed the stone giant’s body, which bore numerous wounds. Though no blood flowed, its aura had become unstable.

“This is my turn!” Unperturbed by their attacks, the stone giant spoke again. A colossal hand of stone descended with a thunderous crash, its surface etched with intricate gray spiritual seals.

A single hand pressing down upon the heavens—before it reached Luotian and his companions, they felt a profound sense of dread.

“Is this the attack of the later epoch?” Sun Keinian murmured, his voice trembling. He felt the stone giant’s assault exceeded his capacity to withstand.

Though the hand’s pressure was immense, its descent was slow. The group could easily escape its range before it struck.

“Let’s go!” They exchanged glances, then transformed into nine beams of divine light, vanishing from the scene and escaping the hand’s attack.

When they landed, the massive stone hand still hovered a hundred feet above the ground. Their hearts lightened.

“Just a clumsy giant—barely touched our hair. I believe we’ll exhaust it soon!” Sun Keinian declared, his voice laced with ease.

“Don’t be complacent. I don’t think it’s that simple,” Luotian frowned, doubting the chaos master’s methods were so feeble.

“Indeed!” Zhuge Qingtian’s gaze bore contemplation. He longed to know what trial his master had left for him.

“Boom…” As Zhuge Qingtian’s words faded, a deafening explosion echoed in their ears. The colossal hand slammed onto the ground.

“Woo…” An invisible wave surged forth, sweeping toward Luotian and his companions. In an instant, the ground beneath them trembled.

Before they could react, the storm enveloped them. Their faces shifted abruptly.

As the storm engulfed Luotian’s group, the gray stones beneath them glowed with a sinister light, radiating waves of instability.

A wave of dizziness overtook Luotian instantly, causing his body to sway uncontrollably.

The others fared no better. Their bodies swayed, unable to stand steady; their eyes grew hazy.

“Boom boom…” The stone hand rose again, bearing overwhelming might as it pressed down upon Luotian and his companions. Though slow, to the dazed group it seemed swift.

A wave of weakness surged through their bodies. Their feet felt like lead, and they could do nothing but watch the mighty hand descend upon them.

“Dodge!” They shouted, their blood boiling as they tried to resist the hand’s descent.

“Boom…” Amid their desperate efforts, they escaped the hand’s grasp at the last moment. Yet this time, they were far more disheveled.

Though they evaded being struck, they had drawn dangerously close to the hand. Luotian could even see the intricate patterns on the mountain-like hand.

The gusts swept over their weakened bodies, sending them flying. Cracks echoed as they were blown back ten thousand feet before landing awkwardly on the ground, their faces pale.

Their expressions darkened further as a second storm swept over them. They lost all strength, even the ability to rise.

“What do we do? Zhuge Jie, you’ve been here before. Tell us how to escape this cursed weakness!”

“Also, Zhuge Qingtian, you’re the disciple of the chaos master. You must know how to break it!” Sun Keinian shouted, his voice tinged with urgency as he gazed at the towering stone giant approaching.

“We only reached the first trial. We suffered heavy losses in the second, so we never passed it,” Zhuge Jie shouted back.

“This is my master’s trial. Do you think he’d tell me how to pass it?” Zhuge Qingtian shouted, his gaze fixed on the stone giant now near them.

“Boom boom…” The thick leg of the stone giant slowly lifted, then descended upon Luotian and his companions as if crushing insects.

“If blood is spilled for rebirth, the trial fails!” A deep voice echoed from the stone giant. Then, with overwhelming might, its massive foot came down.

“Ah!” Zhuge Qingtian roared, his body radiating waves of gray energy. It transformed into a chaotic cosmos. Within him, something seemed to stir. With a thunderous roar, his blood surged as he stood despite the overwhelming weakness.

“Don’t hide it. If we fail, no one benefits!” Zhuge Qingtian shouted at Luotian and his companions, urgency in his voice.

“Hmph!” The others nodded. Their bodies glowed as they fought against the extreme weakness.

“Woo…” Four reincarnation immortal bodies surged into motion, improving Luotian’s complexion slightly. Yet it only lessened the weakness—his condition remained far from normal.

“Damn it! Let it burst!” Luotian’s face darkened. Seeing the foot nearing, he bit his teeth and shattered one reincarnation immortal body.

“Crack…” A clear sound echoed, as if breaking a barrier. Luotian instantly returned to normal.

At the moment he recovered, the stone giant’s foot was only hundreds of feet away. Luotian’s face shifted.

Looking at his companions, he saw they hadn’t yet dispelled the weakness. He wore a bitter smile before leaping into the air.

“Seven hundred feet… five hundred feet… two hundred feet…” His small body appeared beneath the mountain-like foot. He raised his hands to the sky, meeting the stone giant’s foot.

“Pf…” As Luotian blocked the foot, blood spewed from his mouth. His body was hurled downward.

Yet due to his desperate resistance, the foot’s descent slowed somewhat.

“Hurry! I can’t hold on much longer!” Luotian shouted, wind rising around him. His veins bulged as his arms cracked repeatedly, blood spilling.

“Stop it!” Luotian pressed against the immense pressure with one hand while clenching his fist, striking the mountain-like foot.

“Boom… boom…”

“One punch… two punches…” Luotian fought like a madman, his fists striking repeatedly. Fragments of stone fell under his blows. The power of the path spread up the stone giant’s body.

“Rise!” Zhuge Qingtian slowly stood, gray spiritual seals surging from his body. He soared into the air, landing before Luotian and striking the stone giant’s foot as well.

Chapter 1442: Chaos Storm

With Zhuge Qingtian’s aid, Luotian’s pressure lessened. Yet the stone foot still descended, though its speed slowed further, giving them enough time.

“Roar…” Dragon威 surged as Long Jie transformed into his true form. His massive body rose, matching the stone giant in size. A golden dragon tail swept across, striking the stone giant’s body.

“Star震八方!” Zhou Wei stood up, his body radiating star patterns. He waved his hands, and a golden star pierced the chaos, crashing onto the stone giant’s body.

Sun Miechen, Zhuge Hun, Yan Hongtao and others gradually overcame the weakness. Their martial arts flew from their hands again.

Unlike previous试探 attacks, this time they unleashed their full power against the stone giant.

A thunderous roar echoed in the chaos abyss. A series of powerful martial arts struck the stone giant’s body.

Stone fragments flew through the air as, under their combined assault, the stone giant’s body shattered into massive pieces. They scattered in all directions, vanishing into the chaos mist.

“Boom…” Luotian’s body fell awkwardly to the ground, his eyes showing signs of weakness. His arms revealed white bones—clearly severe injuries.

“Did we pass?” Zhuge Qingtian and the others regrouped, gazing at the shattered stone giant. A red light appeared in their vision.

“Passed!” The deep voice echoed again, then fell silent. A red stone floated in the sky, leaving their faces puzzled.

“What is this?” They gazed at the red stone. The old man’s image had vanished, leaving only this dazzling red stone.

“Great Luo Immortal Gold!” Zhuge Qingtian spoke, his eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at the red stone in the sky.

“This is the main material for forging epoch treasures. Legends say it came from the divine realm! Unbreakable! No wonder this stone giant’s defense was so变态!” Sun Miechen’s face showed excitement, his eyes filled with greed as he scanned the others.

“My!” Sun Keinian’s mouth watered, rushing toward the blood-red stone.

“Everything is yours. What are you?” Sun Miechen followed, his face cold as he eyed the divine material.

“Whoever grabs it is its owner!” Zhuge Qingtian knew such precious items would stir everyone’s greed. No one could be persuaded.

“Kill…” Everyone rushed toward the blood-red immortal gold, forgetting their previous unity against the stone giant.

As they fought each other for it, the blood-red immortal gold emitted waves of crimson light. It rushed toward Luotian, who sat still without joining the scramble.

The blood-red immortal gold flashed with radiant light. It instantly appeared before Luotian. If someone watched closely, they would see a thread of golden divine blood on the immortal gold, seeping into it continuously.

“Damn! The immortal gold is sentient. It’s recognized Luotian!” Sun Miechen’s face showed madness, watching the blood-red immortal gold enter Luotian’s body through his third eye. He roared.

“It must have been when he fought the stone giant, splashing his blood onto it. That’s why it recognized him!” Zhuge Qingtian’s eyes showed admiration. He hadn’t expected Luotian’s luck to be so逆天.

The blood-red immortal gold instantly sank into Luotian’s dantian. As he recovered from his injuries, Luotian felt a shock. He could sense the terrifying power of this Great Luo Immortal Gold. If handled properly, it might indeed be forged into a powerful epoch treasure.

“There’s nothing we can do. Since Luotian obtained it, that’s his fortune!” Zhuge Qingtian shook his head, standing there waiting for Luotian to recover.

Long Jie’s face bore coldness. He stood before Luotian, his gaze cautious. Though they had previously agreed, this Great Luo Immortal Gold was too precious. Long Jie wasn’t sure if they would remain trustworthy.

“Alas, alas!” Sun Keinian’s eyes showed greed as he gazed at Luotian sitting cross-legged. Yet, like Long Jie, he stood before Luotian, his body tensely coiled.

“Don’t worry. Since he obtained it, I won’t act against him. This immortal gold is good, but it’s not my main goal!” Zhuge Qingtian shook his head. As a disciple of the epoch master, his standards were extremely high. Even this world-shaking divine object only slightly stirred his heart.

Though the others envied greatly, they didn’t act. After all, Long Jie and Sun Keinian weren’t easy to deal with. Moreover, Luotian was more intimidating.

Though Luotian appeared severely injured, people knew he still had the strength to fight. Such injuries were nothing for them. Especially for Luotian, who ranked first among the nine body types.

Thus, despite their desires, they wouldn’t attack Luotian. The risk was too great.

They all sat cross-legged, beginning to recover their strength. After all, there was still a long time ahead; they needed to maintain peak condition.

Time flowed slowly. Three days passed in the blink of an eye. With the help of medicinal pills, Luotian slowly stood up, a smile on his face. He waved his hand, and a golden dragon appeared in his grip.

The Splitting Sky Spear—Luotian hadn’t used it for a long time. It was the weapon that had accompanied him the longest. He held a special affection for it. However, after his cultivation improved, the spear had become a pseudo-epoch treasure and hadn’t advanced further.

“Old companion. I hope you can become an ultimate weapon!” Luotian smiled, his hands forming a seal. A seven-colored flame flew from his hand, rapidly melting the golden spear.

“Roar…” Roars echoed from the spear. A spear-shaped shadow appeared in Luotian’s vision, rushing into his body and imprinting itself on the Great Luo Immortal Gold.

“I hope you can complete a miraculous transformation!” Luotian sighed deeply. The Splitting Sky Spear was originally a pseudo-epoch treasure level. Now with the Great Luo Immortal Gold’s help, it might advance further. Though it wouldn’t reach epoch treasure status, it would be much stronger than a pseudo-epoch treasure. It could rival treasures forged by the epoch master himself.

“Let’s go!” Feeling Luotian had recovered, Zhuge Qingtian smiled and stood up. He spoke to Luotian.

“Hmph!” Luotian nodded, following Zhuge Qingtian. His eyes held anticipation.

After organizing themselves, they continued deeper into the domain toward what Zhuge Qingtian called the third trial.

“Uu…uu…” After walking for half an hour, a gust of wind passed through their minds. They stopped, faces grim.

“What’s going on? Why is there a wind sound?” Since entering the chaos abyss, they had always felt a sense of wind. Now that it appeared, it surprised them. They sensed a terrifying fluctuation nearby, making them feel alarmed.

“Almost there!” Their brows furrowed. Though they felt danger, they continued forward. After all, their goal wasn’t achieved yet.

After walking another hour, the wind grew stronger, beating against their faces. Yet the chaos mist remained untouched.

“Here!” After two hours, they finally reached a gray hall. Its appearance resembled the chaos holy temple of the chaos domain but lacked its overwhelming aura.

“Uu…” The wind sound came from within the hall, causing their robes to flutter.

“This is where the unease comes from. This third trial requires our cooperation. As for how to cooperate, I don’t know!” Zhuge Qingtian spoke to Luotian and the others.

“Let’s go. We’ll have to face it eventually!” Sun Miechen smiled, stepping into the vast hall.

“Hmph!” Luotian and others clearly agreed with Sun Miechen’s view. They all stepped in, one before the other.

“Woo…” As they entered the hall, a massive aura instantly descended upon them.

In the center of the hall stood a black storm swirling. It spanned the entire hall, causing Luotian and others to narrow their eyes.

The gray storm seemed restrained by something. It continued swirling in the center without moving.

“Clang…” As they were startled, the hall’s door slammed shut behind them.

“This is a chaos storm!” Zhuge Jie stared at the gray storm, fear in his eyes. He turned around abruptly.

“Chaos storm! Damn it!” Hearing Zhuge Jie’s words, Sun Keinian’s face changed. He gazed at the gray storm restrained there, fear in his eyes.

“Damn it! Is the chaos master trying to kill his disciples? This thing should stay restrained, don’t let it escape!” Sun Keinian’s face showed a tremor. He clearly knew what the chaos storm was.

“Boom boom…” As Sun Keinian’s words faded, the gray storm violently trembled in the hall’s center.

Chapter 1443: One More Time

“Jinx!” Luotian’s face darkened at Sun Keinian. Though he didn’t know what the chaos storm was, seeing their fear made him realize it wasn’t good.

“We need to escape! I don’t want to play here!” Sun Keinian shouted, pounding the hall’s door.

But no matter how hard he pounded, the heavy door only emitted a deep sound. Even Sun Keinian couldn’t break it open.

“Woo…” The gray storm trembled continuously. Then, under Sun Keinian’s shock, it roared out, a terrifying fluctuation sweeping through the hall.

“Done! Done! We’re dead!” Sun Keinian chanted, his hands moving to activate the yang fish. But he soon realized in this strange hall, he couldn’t activate his treasures.

“Boom boom…” The gray storm destroyed everything. It instantly broke free, sweeping through the entire hall.

Gusts of wind rose. Before it arrived, Luotian felt his face sting. His heart trembled, finally sensing the storm’s uniqueness.

“Damn it! The chaos master’s methods are so absurd. He can even restrain a chaos storm!” Sun Miechen gazed at the storm approaching them, fear in his eyes.

Chaos storms were rarely seen. Only ancient records of various holy clans mentioned them. But chaos storms had another name—death storm.

Chaos creates, but chaos storms represent the extreme of reversal. Anyone caught in a chaos storm rarely survives.

“Pf…” As they were anxious, the terrifying storm swept over Luotian and others. The tearing force instantly left them with wounds.

“Unresistable!” Even as epoch-level warriors, they felt powerless against this chaos storm.

“There must be a chance. Look at those small altars around us—nine in total. If we each stand on one, something might change. That’s what this trial means by cooperation!” Zhuge Qingtian said, his gaze scanning the nine altars around the hall.

“Good!” They didn’t hesitate. There was no time to think, as the destructive storm had already approached them. In this hall, there was nowhere to escape.

As their bodies rushed toward the altars, the gray storm instantly filled the entire hall.

Their speed seemed fast, but the storm’s speed was even faster. In an instant, it filled the hall.

Luotian stepped onto an altar. At that moment, his foot emitted a humming sound. White light rose from beneath him, easing Luotian’s heart.

“Finally effective!” Luotian felt relieved. He glanced at the others, then his face suddenly changed.

They had all stepped onto altars, but only Zhuge Huangchao was slightly slower. He hadn’t made it.

At that moment, Luotian realized the vibration under his feet also stopped. His heart filled with fear.

“Damn it!” Luotian had no time to think. He activated his reincarnation immortal body, a white barrier surrounding him.

Others noticed Zhuge Huangchao’s situation. Their eyes showed regret, then quickly formed barriers to surround themselves.

“Pf…” The terrifying storm swept over Zhuge Huangchao, turning him into a blood mist that floated in the storm.

“Too strong!” Luotian’s heart trembled. He knew Zhuge Huangchao’s strength was clear—though not as strong as them, it was much stronger than ordinary epoch-level mid-stage warriors. Yet against this storm, he had no chance to resist.

“Damn it!” Luotian’s face darkened. The storm was already at his front, striking his barrier.

“Crack…” The white barrier shattered into fragments. Pain like a knife cut through Luotian’s body.

“Ah…” Luotian roared, his body glowing white. He tried to withstand the world-destroying storm with his invincible flesh.

“However, soon Luotian realized his futility. In three breaths, his body turned into a blood mist, scattered in the storm.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Blood mists bloomed within the gray storm. Luotian wasn’t the first—Sun Miechen and others hadn’t even one breath before turning into blood mists, scattered on the altars.

“Uu…” The storm swept for a quarter of an hour before slowly returning to the hall’s center.

The entire hall was silent. Nine blood mists spread across the altars, an eye-catching sight. If someone were here, they would be shocked.

“Woo…” White light flowed within the divine blood. A faint vitality sprouted. Luotian’s figure gradually formed, his face pale. His eyes held fear—Luotian hadn’t felt such fear in a long time, the true fear of facing death.

“Ah…” Sun Keinian, Long Jie, Zhuge Qingtian and others formed after Luotian. None were exceptions; all had pale faces, their cultivation levels dropped.

“This is terrifying. It’s trying to kill us!” Sun Keinian trembled, gazing at the chaos storm now restrained again. His eyes showed endless fear.

“This is a nightmare! If it hits us again, I won’t survive!” Zhou Wei’s eyes also showed intense fear. He spoke softly.

They were all prodigies of their time, yet this storm had reduced them to blood mists. If it were known, no one would believe it. But the truth was right before them.

They all trembled as they looked at each other, thinking about what would happen if they perished here. It would be a great joke.

“Ghost! I felt under my feet had vibrations, but it stopped halfway!” Yan Hongtao looked puzzled, gazing at the altars behind him.

“It was because Zhuge Huangchao didn’t make it!” Sun Miechen spoke, drawing everyone’s attention to Zhuge Huangchao.

“I… I was just a little slow!” Zhuge Huangchao, seeing their gazes, defended himself.

“This is the legend of a pig-like teammate!” Sun Keinian couldn’t help but mock, looking at Zhuge Huangchao with disdain.

“Rubbish! It was a mistake. If we do it again, I’ll definitely make it!” Zhuge Huangchao’s face turned red. He shouted back.

“Boom boom…” As Zhuge Huangchao’s words faded, a series of thunderous sounds echoed again. Luotian and others’ faces turned pale.

“Damn it! Your mouths must be blessed, you bastard!”

“If Zhuge Huangchao doesn’t make it this time, we all die!” Sun Keinian quickly flew toward the altar.

“Hurry up!” Zhuge Qingtian, clearly anxious, shouted at them while flying.

But their speed was noticeably slower than before. They had suffered heavy injuries, and their strength was less than half of what it was.

The world-destroying storm roared again, sweeping toward them. This time it was even more terrifying.

“Boom…” Luotian stood steadily on the altar, his gaze scanning around. His eyes twitched.

In his view, everyone had stepped onto the altars—again leaving Zhuge Huangchao one step behind.

“Ah…” Zhuge Huangchao roared, his hair standing on end. He felt the earth-shattering fluctuation behind him and fought desperately.

“Hu…” The storm swept in, and just as it was about to envelop them, Zhuge Huangchao’s body finally stepped onto the altar.

“Woo…” As Zhuge Huangchao landed on the altar, nine beams of light surged skyward. A powerful barrier instantly rose from beneath the nine of them, enveloping Luotian and others.

“Comfortable!” The first feeling Luotian had was a sense of relief. Every pore on his body felt open.

The terrifying chaos storm also swept into the entire hall, striking the barrier before them.

“Hu…” Feeling the barrier was solid, Luotian sighed deeply. He then looked at the gray storm through the barrier.

But soon, the beams of light from the altars converged in the hall’s sky. They formed a wheel of light, sweeping toward the chaos storm. Luotian was shocked.

“Is it trying to exterminate this terrifying storm?” Luotian’s heart trembled. He watched the white wheel, which carried an overwhelming aura, slowly rotating downward.

“Boom boom…” The thunderous sound echoed through the barrier in Luotian’s ears. His eyes showed awe.

Luotian was right. The white wheel rotated continuously, plunging into the storm. It instantly exterminated the previously powerful storm, turning it into gray chaos currents that swirled in the hall.

Luotian and his companions sat on the altars, their eyes filled with amazement. They marveled at the chaos master’s unparalleled methods and felt even more reverence for epoch masters.

“This era, I must become such an ultimate existence!” Sun Miechen stood on the altar, clenching his fists tightly. His eyes held determination.

Chapter 1444: The Chaos Master’s Inheritance

Nine figures stood on the nine altars, their eyes filled with reverence. They gazed at the massive wheel of light exterminating the storm. Their hearts were awed by the epoch master’s power.

“Finally passed!” Luotian sighed deeply, standing within the barrier. He gazed at the chaos currents in the hall. Though powerful, it was much less terrifying than before.

The humming echoed. As they relaxed, the altars beneath them emitted changes. A powerful suction arose from the altars.

At the moment of the suction, the chaos currents in the hall were suddenly pulled toward the nine altars.

“What is this?” Luotian furrowed his brows. His face then showed waves of light, and he sat cross-legged, activating the Reincarnation Heaven Art to refine the furious chaos energy.

Not only Luotian, but others did the same. They all sat cross-legged, their faces showing excitement as they activated their arts.

“Indeed! After danger comes great fortune. This chaos storm, when gathered, is a destructive force. But if dispersed, it’s concentrated power—great nourishment for epoch-level warriors!” Sun Miechen spoke softly. His voice carried excitement because he was close to the epoch late stage. If he refined the chaos storm entering him, he might reach the epoch late stage.

The hall fell silent again. Only the thunderous sounds from the nine altars echoed. Luotian and his companions’ auras gradually rose.

“Great fortune!” Luotian refined, feeling even more awed by the vast epoch power contained in the chaos storm. It was truly terrifying.

“Strive to improve!” Luotian smiled, then focused on refining the massive epoch power.

“One day… two days…”

Time flowed slowly. Seven days passed in an instant. The hall gradually returned to calm as Luotian and his companions refined it.

“Ha… ha…” On the tenth day, a loud laugh echoed in the hall. A shocking aura rose from Zhuge Huangchao’s altar.

“I’ve entered the epoch late stage!” Zhuge Huangchao jumped down from his altar, eyes filled with excitement. He scanned the others, a hint of pride in his gaze.

“What’s there to be proud of? I’ve also entered the epoch late stage!” Sun Keinian showed disdain, stepping down from his altar. He slightly frowned.

While they bickered, Luotian and others opened their eyes. However, none had entered the epoch late stage. Compared to Zhuge Huangchao and Sun Keinian, they needed too much resources.

Even without entering the epoch late stage, their auras were close. They believed that with some cultivation time, entering the epoch late stage would be natural.

“Five reincarnation immortal bodies!” Luotian felt excited. He wasn’t troubled by not entering the epoch late stage.

At this moment, five reincarnation immortal bodies radiated light in his dantian. If counted carefully, there were six total—because one was extremely illusory. This greatly boosted Luotian’s combat power. He confidently believed that even if Zhuge Huangchao was in the epoch late stage, he would be helpless before him.

“Truly encountered fortune!” Luotian clenched his fists. His eyes showed a smile. He knew how difficult it was for his reincarnation immortal bodies to form. None of them were cultivated through hard work, but rather through opportunities. If he had to cultivate them himself, he might still be stuck in the epoch early stage.

“The next trial should be the final one. There, my master’s unparalleled inheritance awaits!” Zhuge Qingtian’s eyes showed excitement as he spoke to Luotian and others.

Hearing Zhuge Qingtian’s words, their eyes met. They knew that perhaps they would face conflict next.

“Let’s go!” Zhuge Qingtian smiled, walking to the spot where the chaos storm had stayed. A gray opening appeared beneath his feet.

Zhuge Qingtian leaped, as if jumping into the gray mist. He vanished from Luotian and others’ sight.

They didn’t delay, all leaping into the entrance. They vanished from the hall.

“Woo…” A series of humming sounds echoed in Luotian’s ears. The surrounding gray mist surged. He didn’t know how long it had been, as if he truly jumped into the abyss.

“Boom…” His legs landed firmly on the ground. A cave-like place appeared in his vision.

“Indeed, the chaos master built a cave within this chaos abyss!” Others also landed. Their eyes showed amazement.

The entire hall was tidy. Even after countless years, in this misty abyss, it still seemed as if someone lived there—no dust at all.

The hall was vast. However, what amazed them most was the massive statue in its center.

A dignified figure stood there. Its eyes, like solid reality, gazed into the distance. Even as a statue, it gave people a desire to worship.

Beneath the statue was a cushion. Luotian furrowed his brows, confusion in his eyes.

“Did someone come here before?” Luotian furrowed his brows, muttering to himself. His eyes also carried caution.

Zhuge Qingtian showed a respectful expression, without hesitation. He led Zhuge Jie and Zhuge Huangchao to the statue’s front, kneeling down.

Luotian and others also showed respect. They bowed before the gray statue. The only person who could make Zhuge Qingtian kneel was the chaos master, who had vanished.
