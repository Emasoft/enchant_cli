“Foolish youth! You have slain our two great sects’ Saint’s Disciple and insulted the three major sects. Even if Gu Tian Shu himself arrived, he could not save you!” Jin Anhe of the Jin Chan Sect’s Supreme Sect Master spoke, his voice laced with a hint of killing intent.

Unlike the Shanhai Pavilion and Lihuo Temple, every member of Jin Chan Sect—from its Supreme Sect Master Jin Anhe to the current sect master Jin Jingtian and even the slain Saint’s Disciple Jin Tianlu—shared the surname Jin. Thus, the entire Jin Chan Sect was essentially the Jin family. Luotian had first slain Jin Tianlu and left Jin Jingtian in such a state of disarray. Naturally, Jin Anhe held little regard for Luotian. If not for his fear of Gu Tian Shu, Luotian would already be a corpse.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Sect Master of Lihuo Temple, Dongfang Zhenheng, remained motionless, merely observing Luotian with a steady gaze without speaking.

“Summon Gu Tian Shu! If you truly can bring him forth, we shall overlook these matters!” Seeing Jin Anhe’s face brimming with murderous intent, Wang Jianzhou quickly interjected, fearing that this man might impulsively kill Luotian. If Gu Tian Shu were indeed alive, angering him would spell disaster for the three major sects.

At this point, Luotian knew that even a late-stage Saint’s power was beyond his ability to resist. Only Gu Tian Shu could resolve this matter. Though Gu Tian Shu claimed he was suppressed by the Dao, Luotian believed that within this Fire Domain, Gu Tian Shu was an invincible force—unparalleled.

Yet Luotian also understood that if Gu Tian Shu intervened, it would hasten his death. Such a fate was something Luotian did not wish to witness.

Seeing Luotian lost in thought, Jin Anhe grew impatient and barked again: “If you do not summon Gu Tian Shu, I shall act myself. Believe me—capturing you would leave Gu Tian Shu unable to let you die!”

Jin Anhe finished speaking and waved his hand, summoning a massive blue hand that materialized instantly. Though it seemed effortless, the immense pressure it radiated made Luotian’s face pale. His already wounded body cracked again.

Seeing Jin Anhe attack, Lu Han Tian and the others dared not speak. They knew these three Supreme Sect Masters might have been lurking in the shadows to observe, but they had gleaned nothing.

“Fine. I will lead you,” Luotian said, gazing at the colossal hand that could crush him with a single strike. He knew he could not withstand it. His face flickered, and he addressed the three.

“Very well. Lead the way,” Jin Anhe nodded slightly upon seeing Luotian’s compliance, dispersing the hand that could kill Luotian with ease. His gaze turned to Luotian, awaiting his guidance.

“Lead the way, but I hope you do not regret meeting Gu Zǔ,” Luotian said softly, his tone calm. He surveyed the three with a glance before heading toward Tongtian Continent alongside Long Jie and Song Yongkang.

“Foolish youth! We have lived for so long, dominated the Fire Domain. Never once have we regretted anything. Enough talk—should Gu Tian Shu still live, let us see if he possesses the strength to save you. If not, you know the consequences!” Jin Anhe’s face curled with a sneer as he followed Luotian.

Wang Jianzhou and Dongfang Zhenheng remained expressionless, their eyes filled with contemplation. They followed Luotian alongside Du Hongtao and the others.

In a moment, Luotian had led them to the skies above Tongtian Mountain. His gaze carried reverence as he looked upon it.

“Someday, I shall defy the heavens!” Dongfang Zhenheng gazed at the calligraphy left by Gu Tian Shu long ago. Though centuries had passed, its ancient and formidable aura remained undiminished.

“Hmph. To dare challenge the Dao—truly audacious. If not for being suppressed by the Dao, the Fire Domain would never have had our three sects. It would have belonged to the ancient clans!” Jin Anhe’s voice carried a note of mockery despite his admiration.

“Do not speak so. Gu Tian Shu was indeed worthy of respect—a prodigy who dared to defy the Dao. Yet, he was ultimately suppressed by the Dao. A true tragedy,” Wang Jianzhou said with a sigh, his gaze upon the eight characters.

Unlike Wang Jianzhou and Jin Anhe, Dongfang Zhenheng’s eyes flickered with a brief sorrow before his expression turned reverent toward Tongtian Mountain.

“Grand Ancestor, someone wishes to meet you. Will you see them or not?” Luotian knelt before Tongtian Mountain, his gaze filled with reverence. His heart ached with self-reproach, cursing his own helplessness for having to summon Gu Tian Shu.

At the same time, Luotian sent silent thoughts toward Gu Tian Shu: “Grand Ancestor, merely release your aura to scare them. I will handle the rest. Do not intervene!”

But as Luotian’s words ended, Tongtian Mountain remained eerily still. Not a single ripple disturbed it. Even the disciples and elders of Tongtian Sect looked puzzled, gazing at Luotian in the sky.

“Supreme Sect Masters of the three sects!” The disciples of Tongtian Sect saw Du Hongtao and the others, their faces paled. Realizing that these three stood so respectfully behind Dongfang Zhenheng and Wang Jianzhou, they knew Tongtian Sect was about to face great calamity. To have three sect masters bow so low, one could only imagine the terrifying power and status of Wang Jianzhou’s group.

“Foolish youth! You still dare to play tricks! I suspect you’ve been deceiving us all along. You merely obtained Gu Tian Shu’s inheritance but now trick us into thinking he still lives! Today, I shall make you pay for deceiving the three sects!” Jin Anhe’s face finally twisted into a snarl as he saw Tongtian Mountain remained silent after Luotian’s words.

Wang Jianzhou’s expression also turned cold, his gaze locking onto Luotian with a hint of murderous intent.

“Alas…” Dongfang Zhenheng’s face bore disappointment, his long sigh echoing before he could speak. Just then, Jin Anhe—impatient and enraged—snarled, his massive blue hand surging into the sky with a tempest of power.

“This…” As Jin Anhe’s divine force hand materialized, the disciples of Tongtian Sect gasped in terror. They could do nothing but collapse to the ground, speechless.

It was clear that Jin Anhe’s strike would annihilate Tongtian Mountain entirely, even if Gu Tian Shu’s calligraphy still stood as a guardian.

Yet Luotian remained calm, his gaze unflinching. He ignored the massive blue hand descending upon him, ready to obliterate him.

“Foolish youth! Even now you play games! If Gu Tian Shu were alive, your insolent attitude alone would warrant your death. I shall see what this ancient Gu Tian Shu, suppressed by the Dao for so long, can do against me!” Jin Anhe sneered as he saw Luotian’s calm demeanor. His blue hand expanded twice its size, speed surging instantly.

“Crack…” The immense pressure struck Luotian first, shattering his body again. Blood spewed forth uncontrollably.

“Let them go! Do not appear!” Just as Jin Anhe’s hand was about to strike Luotian, a cold scoff echoed in everyone’s ears. Though the voice was calm, it carried an indomitable authority, like a thunderclap splitting their minds. At the same time, Jin Anhe’s hand shattered into a whirlwind of wind that swept across Tongtian Mountain.

“Who…?” Jin Anhe’s face paled, his gaze turning toward Tongtian Mountain with disbelief. Though he could not yet identify the speaker, his mind already knew the answer.

Chapter 917: I Shall Appear ()

Above Tongtian Mountain, the Supreme Sect Masters of the three sects stood in terror, gazing at Tongtian Mountain with expressions of disbelief. Though they did not yet know who had spoken, their minds already held the answer: Gu Tian Shu—the immortal sage who had dominated the Fire Domain for countless years.

Jin Anhe stood pale, though he had prepared himself for Gu Tian Shu’s survival and even suspected his power might have waned. Yet the reality of encountering him still left him trembling.

The other two Supreme Sect Masters—Dongfang Zhenheng and Wang Jianzhou—had once heard of Gu Tian Shu’s name. When Gu Tian Shu had dominated the realm, they were merely novices in cultivation, and thus knew of his terrifying might.

“This is strength! A name alone could make a late-stage Saint hesitate!” Luotian sighed inwardly, his gaze resolute.

“I shall become like Grand Ancestor Gu Tian Shu! No— I shall dominate the Nine Realms, so that all who hear my name, Luotian, dare not harm anyone from the Tianyuan Continent!” Luotian’s inner voice roared as he gazed at Tongtian Mountain with reverence.

A profound aura emanated from the base of Tongtian Mountain, spreading into people’s perceptions and leaving them awestruck.

The disciples of Tongtian Sect wore expressions of shock. Though they had lived on Tongtian Mountain for years, they were unaware that a terrifying presence lurked beneath it.

“Grand Ancestor Gu Tian Shu? They speak of the legends from these past days?” The disciples of Tongtian Sect erupted into chaos. Their despair, brought by Wang Jianzhou’s group, vanished instantly. They now stared at Tongtian Mountain with fervor.

All eyes turned to the base of Tongtian Mountain, where an awe-inspiring aura radiated. The eight characters on the mountain wall glowed with brilliant golden light, unmistakable.

“Grand Ancestor does not wish to meet you. Are you certain you still want to?” Luotian’s face bore a playful smirk as he surveyed Jin Anhe and the others, his gaze filled with arrogance.

“Hmph…” Upon hearing Luotian’s words, Jin Anhe and the others hesitated. Their gazes met with unprecedented gravity.

They exchanged glances, eventually nodding in silent agreement. After all, the situation had reached this point—without seeing Gu Tian Shu, they would not rest easy.

“Hmph. Merely shattering my attack with an aura is insufficient. Please, Grand Ancestor, appear and meet us,” Jin Anhe spoke first, his gaze turning toward the base of Tongtian Mountain.

They had once thought Gu Tian Shu was dead, so they could afford to be disrespectful. Now that they were certain he lived, yet unsure of his current power level, they softened their tone. If Gu Tian Shu remained a prodigy, there might still be room for negotiation. If not, both Luotian and Gu Tian Shu would die—leaving a dangerous threat.

“Do not… meet… further纠缠… death!” A low voice echoed from the base of Tongtian Mountain. Though its words were fragmented, it carried an overwhelming authority.

“Grand Ancestor refuses to meet us. Do you truly believe we should persist?” Jin Anhe’s inner voice sneered. The more Gu Tian Shu remained hidden, the more it proved his power had declined. Otherwise, how could he allow these three novices to run wild?

“Jin Anhe, do not overstep. Grand Ancestor does not deign to argue with you. Do not take advantage of his courtesy!” Luotian’s eyes flickered with tension, sighing inwardly. These three were indeed the strongest in the Fire Domain for countless years—even after Gu Tian Shu’s aura had intimidated them, they remained fearless.

“Alas… what to do?” Luotian sighed inwardly. These three were determined not to leave without seeing Gu Tian Shu. Yet if they saw him now, they would assume he was weak and strike immediately, hastening his demise.

“Foolish youth! You still play games. We elders speak—what are you? Today, I shall take Grand Ancestor’s place to teach you a lesson!” Hearing Luotian’s words, Jin Anyang’s eyes flared. He still intended to provoke Gu Tian Shu.

“Hum…” Jin Anhe’s blue hand凝聚 again, but this time he used eight-tenths of his strength. This strike could obliterate any late-stage Saint, its power overwhelming. Instantly, it descended upon Luotian.

“Crack…” Luotian’s body—just recovering—shattered again. His face contorted in agony, unable to resist. In a moment, he would be reduced to blood mist.

“Damn it!” Luotian’s eyes turned crimson. A wild aura radiated from him, his hatred for Jin Anhe’s repeated attempts to provoke Gu Tian Shu now boiling over. His gaze toward Jin Anyang was icy.

“Useless. Against absolute power, suppress your hatred!” Jin Anhe’s face curled with a sneer, his withered hand pressing into the void.

“Seems… after so many years of seclusion, no one remembers me! What are you? I, Gu Tian Shu’s descendant, can be moved so easily?” A low voice echoed. The blue hand Jin Anhe had凝聚 with eight-tenths of his strength shattered again, transforming into a terrifying storm that swept across Tongtian Mountain.

Seeing the storm’s fury, the disciples of Tongtian Sect gasped in fear. Though it had been neutralized, its divine force storm was beyond their capacity to withstand.

The void shattered. The terrifying storm seemed drawn by an invisible force, expelled beyond the domain. Tongtian Sect’s disciples exhaled in relief.

“Terrible! A late-stage Saint truly is terrifying. Even its aftereffects are beyond our reach!” The disciples of Tongtian Sect murmured, their awe deepening. Even without Gu Tian Shu appearing, he had neutralized the terrifying hand—leaving them awestruck.

“Hum…” A cascade of radiant light erupted from the base of Tongtian Mountain, ascending into the sky. An aura that made people’s minds tremble slowly filled their hearts, as if a primordial beast was awakening. Jin Anhe, Wang Jianzhou, and Dongfang Zhenheng’s faces bore a rare gravity.

“You wish to meet me? Then let us meet,” a low voice echoed in their ears. At the same time, a withered figure emerged from the light, resembling a corpse. His body held no aura, his eyes lifeless as he surveyed Wang Jianzhou and Jin Anhe.

Struck by Gu Tian Shu’s gaze, the three fell from the sky. Their hair stood on end, a spine-chilling sensation rising within them.

“Revere Grand Ancestor!” The disciples of Tongtian Sect bowed in reverence, their millions kneeling before him, eyes ablaze with fervor.

Luotian’s lips curled in bitterness. He had never expected to finally summon Gu Tian Shu, his heart praying he would not intervene.

Gu Tian Shu gazed at the sky, whether toward the heavens or the blazing sun above. His eyes narrowed slightly, his body seeming to regain a touch of vitality.

“What business do you have with me? My current rule is that one life must be given for each meeting. Decide among yourselves— who shall come?” Gu Tian Shu’s voice echoed, his tone that of a sovereign ruler. Even the Dao would yield before him.

“Hum…” Golden characters glowed on Gu Tian Shu’s back, a massive suppression force rising from it. A heavy aura even bent his already withered body slightly, the sound of creaking bones echoing from him.

“Truly! Gu Tian Shu was suppressed by the Dao!” Jin Anhe and Wang Jianzhou’s faces lit with excitement. They clearly felt their pressure had lessened after the characters glowed.

Dongfang Zhenheng, however, was lost in thought. He remained standing, his gaze fixed on Gu Tian Shu. No one knew what he was thinking, but his eyes held immense excitement. Yet all focused on Gu Tian Shu, none noticing Dongfang Zhenheng’s subtle change.

“Gu Tian Shu! You once dominated the Nine Realms. Now, you are old and suppressed by the Dao, clinging to life. What right do you have to speak before us? This is no longer your era! I, Jin Anhe, shall see if the Gu Tian Shu who once dominated the Fire Domain still holds any of his former strength!” Jin Anhe felt his pressure had lessened, his face alight with joy. He drew a blue sword in hand, gazing at Gu Tian Shu with provocation.

Wang Jianzhou’s face bore contemplation, his gaze on Gu Tian Shu without acting rashly.

“Then you it is! I’ve long found you annoying!” Gu Tian Shu waved his hand, a cascade of seals emerging from it. They formed the character “Zhen,” which pressed into his back.

After the character was imprinted, Gu Tian Shu’s hunched form straightened slightly. His body seemed younger, his eyes flashing with cold light.

“Late-stage Saint! I never expected your power to remain unchanged after so many years of suppression!” Jin Anhe’s face bore shock. He had never imagined Gu Tian Shu to be so formidable.

“Hmph! Late-stage Saint or not, your vitality is no longer what it was. Wang Xiong, let us combine our strength to subdue him!” Jin Anhe’s face lit with excitement as he addressed Wang Jianzhou.

“Defeating Grand Ancestor is impossible. First, ask if I am willing!” Before Wang Jianzhou could respond, a low voice echoed in their ears. A figure appeared before Gu Tian Shu, kneeling.

Chapter 918: Blood Stains Tongtian ()

Above Tongtian Sect, people gaped in astonishment at the kneeling figure in the sky. Their eyes were filled with awe, even Gu Tian Shu’s expression bore confusion as he gazed at the kneeling elder.

“Revere Grand Ancestor!” The voice of reverence echoed in Tongtian Mountain’s sky. Dongfang Zhenheng knelt respectfully, showing no hesitation.

Luotian was stunned by the scene. Though he had suspected Lihuo Temple and Gu Tian Shu might share some connection, he never imagined it to be this deep. It left him speechless.

“Dongfang Zhenheng, you…” Everyone was stunned, even Jin Anhe and Du Hongtao.

Dongfang Zhenheng was the youngest among the three Supreme Sect Masters. Compared to Du Hongtao and Jin Anhe, he had risen later. Thus, they were unfamiliar with his background. They never expected Dongfang Zhenheng to share a connection with Gu Tian Shu.

“Are you my descendant? Do you bear the surname Gu?” Gu Tian Shu gazed at Dongfang Zhenheng. Though a sense of familiarity stirred within him, he felt no kinship. Thus, Gu Tian Shu concluded that Dongfang Zhenheng was not of the Gu family.

“Grand Ancestor, do you recall Dongfang Chenxi?” Dongfang Zhenheng’s face bore reverence as he stood, gazing at Gu Tian Shu and uttering a name that made Gu Tian Shu tremble.

“Dongfang Chenxi. Hmph, you are a descendant of the Dongfang family? I never expected to meet one of their kind again. Indeed, you are Chenxi’s descendant—my own!” Gu Tian Shu’s lifeless eyes flickered with nostalgia.

“Indeed! You are of the Dongfang family!” Jin Anhe’s face shifted, his gaze turning to Dongfang Zhenheng with disbelief.

Long ago, the Gu and Dongfang families were both great clans. Their ties were so deep they were like brothers in arms. Gu Tian Shu had once dominated the Fire Domain, and his wife was Dongfang Chenxi, the pearl of the Dongfang family. Gu Tian Shu had only ever loved one woman—Dongfang Chenxi.

Later, Gu Tian Shu’s spirit soared. He carved his calligraphy on Tongtian Mountain before being suppressed by the Dao, leaving Dongfang Chenxi behind. Time passed, and red hair turned white. Though Dongfang Chenxi was a late-stage Saint herself, she could not withstand time’s passage. Her sorrow and longing led her to sit in meditation until her body dissolved.

Time passed, the Gu family declined. So did the Dongfang family, their bond severed. The Gu family chose to retreat beyond the domain, while the Dongfang family vanished into obscurity within the Fire Domain.

Jin Anhe and Du Hongtao never expected to meet both the legendary Grand Ancestor Gu Tian Shu and a descendant of the once-mighty Dongfang family. And this descendant was none other than Dongfang Zhenheng, the Supreme Sect Master of Lihuo Temple.

“Now… only I remain of the Dongfang family!” Dongfang Zhenheng’s face bore a bitter smile as he spoke of his family’s plight, causing Gu Tian Shu to sigh deeply.

“Everything is my fault. I am the traitor of both families. If I had ruled for ten more years, allowing our two clans to flourish fully, there would be no current tragedies!” Gu Tian Shu’s face bore deep self-reproach. Especially after hearing of Dongfang Chenxi’s sorrowful end, he was heartbroken.

Luotian listened to Dongfang Zhenheng’s account, his heart stirred with sorrow. Red hair turned white—yet he had been suppressed beneath the mountain, never seeing his beloved’s final farewell. What anguish!

“Hope you can revive the Dongfang family. If you have any questions in cultivation, come to Tongtian Mountain and seek me out. Now I must deal with this matter!” Gu Tian Shu’s eyes brimmed with hatred, his gaze turning to Jin Anhe and Du Hongtao.

Dongfang Zhenheng’s story had filled Gu Tian Shu with self-reproach. Now, he longed to kill—how long he lived no longer mattered. He was a traitor to both families and deserved death, why linger?

Furious Gu Tian Shu was terrifying. His overwhelming aura made people struggle to breathe, even the Dao seemed to avoid his wrath. The space around Tongtian Mountain was locked in place, no escape.

“Terrible!” Du Hongtao and Jin Anhe’s hearts trembled. Now that Gu Tian Shu had fully unleashed his power, they realized the vast gap between them and him. Facing Gu Tian Shu’s might now felt like being trapped in a swamp, as commoners before their king.

Seeing Gu Tian Shu’s state, Luotian knew he was about to lose control. This would drive anyone mad. He quickly sent thoughts to Dongfang Zhenheng, informing him of Gu Tian Shu’s condition.

Dongfang Zhenheng furrowed his brows, quickly speaking: “Grand Ancestor, rest a moment. I shall handle this matter!” His face bore reverence as he halted Gu Tian Shu’s gathering aura.

Feeling his debt to the descendants, especially Dongfang Chenxi’s last descendant, Gu Tian Shu would not defy him. He nodded slightly, standing there. His eyes no longer lifeless but flashed with fierce light, like two suns that made Du Hongtao and Jin Anhe uncomfortable.

“Wang Xiong! Give me a favor. Do not interfere!” Dongfang Zhenheng smiled, addressing Du Hongtao.

“This…” Wang Jianzhou’s face shifted. He glanced at Jin Anhe before nodding, keeping a distance from him and Du Hongtao.

Du Hongtao was no fool. One Gu Tian Shu alone was enough to overwhelm them. Add an equal in strength like Dongfang Zhenheng, and the result would be clear.

“Wang Jianzhou… you!” Seeing Wang Jianzhou agree to Dongfang Zhenheng’s request, Jin Anhe’s face darkened. He was now completely isolated and no match for Gu Tian Shu.

“Jin Anhe, you have long disrespected Grand Ancestor. If there is no resolution, this matter will not end!” Dongfang Zhenheng’s face bore dominance as he gazed at Jin Anhe, his voice resounding.

Luotian remained calm, watching the situation unfold toward his hopes. He sighed in relief.

“Good! Good! Good! I shall see who can stop me. I, Jin Anhe, have lived countless years and never given anyone a resolution. A withered Gu Tian Shu wishes to make me submit? Dream on!” Jin Anhe was clearly proud. Though weak, he remained defiant.

“Then I shall have to detain you!” Dongfang Zhenheng’s battle spirit surged. His eyes glowed with golden light, a blue sword appearing in his hand.

“Hmph. You still call me a junior! Today, let me test whether your Lihuo Temple’s Nine Heavens Sword Scripture is stronger or my Jin Chan Sect’s Golden Toad Transformation!” Jin Anhe clearly looked down on Dongfang Zhenheng, his face confident. His hands moved swiftly.

“You call me a junior, but what are you to me?” As the two were about to clash, Gu Tian Shu’s aged voice echoed beneath the sky. His withered figure soared into the air, like an eagle spreading its wings. A massive blue hand surged toward Jin Anhe with apocalyptic power.

The overwhelming force struck people’s bodies, causing them to startle and fear.

Luotian’s face shifted. Not because of Gu Tian Shu’s strike that would destroy Tongtian Mountain—Gu Tian Shu was an immortal, how could he not have considered this?

What troubled Luotian was Gu Tian Shu’s attack itself. His power had been so immense, how much would it cost his life? It was worrying.

“Alas…” Luotian sighed inwardly. He knew Gu Tian Shu had been so repressed for years, needing to vent his rage. The best way was to kill.

“Damn it!” Jin Anhe realized he could not match Gu Tian Shu in an instant. His face contorted with despair.

Yet Jin Anhe was a late-stage Saint himself. Facing Gu Tian Shu’s strike, he quickly activated his Golden Toad Transformation, reinforcing his body.

The blue toad image merged into Jin Anhe’s body. At the same time, Gu Tian Shu’s hand struck his formidable body.

“Crack…” Like a thunderclap, Jin Anhe’s powerful body shattered under Gu Tian Shu’s strike. His eyes widened in terror, blood spewing uncontrollably.

A murmur spread among the crowd. They gazed at Gu Tian Shu in the sky, their eyes filled with reverence. The disciples of Tongtian Sect were even more fervent, shouting loudly.

What was strange was that after Gu Tian Shu’s apocalyptic strike struck Jin Anhe, no sound echoed. Not even the disciples of Tongtian Sect felt any disturbance—only a faint breeze touched their faces.

A vast amount of blue divine blood scattered across Tongtian Mountain’s walls, a sight that made people shudder. Du Hongtao’s face bore bitterness as he gazed at Gu Tian Shu in the sky, silently thanking Dongfang Zhenheng for giving him a way out. Otherwise, with both himself and Jin Anhe combined, they would not have stood against Gu Tian Shu.

“Indeed! The Fire Domain’s Grand Ancestor. Even suppressed by the Dao, he remains as formidable as ever! A true strength—only a true strength!” Luotian clenched his fists, admiration in his eyes. This was the first time he had ever revered someone.

Chapter 919: The New Three Major Sects ()

On Tongtian Mountain’s walls, blue divine blood stained the surface—visceral and shocking. The disciples of Tongtian Sect were in a frenzy, their eyes filled with fervor as they gazed at Gu Tian Shu in the sky.

To have slain a late-stage Saint with one strike—what audacity! Gu Tian Shu, even suppressed by the Dao for countless years, remained as formidable as ever. He would not allow anyone to insult him.

“I said that to meet me, the cost is one life of a late-stage Saint. You seem most suitable!” Gu Tian Shu stood in the sky, gazing at Jin Anhe whose body was shattered beyond repair. His voice carried coldness.

Jin Anhe’s face paled, his heart filled with terror. He never expected Gu Tian Shu to be so powerful—seeming on the brink of death, yet still霸道. One strike had nearly cost him his life.

“Grand Ancestor, please spare me this time!” Jin Anhe finally relented. He had hoped for a chance to escape, but now he realized it was futile before Gu Tian Shu. He was completely crushed.

“Grand Ancestor’s cultivation—was it not late-stage Saint?” Du Hongtao’s face bore disbelief. He and Jin Anhe were both late-stage Saints, never encountering a late-stage Saint before. They had thought it was merely one level apart. Yet the gap in power was so vast.

“Too late… since I have already struck, I must recover the loss!” Gu Tian Shu’s aged voice echoed in their ears. He raised his hand again, another massive blue hand surging forth to crush Jin Anhe.

“Pound!” Before the hand could reach Jin Anhe, his formidable body exploded into a mist of blood, scattering across the heavens. People shuddered.

The blue divine blood slowly coalesced. Jin Anhe attempted to regenerate with his blood, but Gu Tian Shu gave him no chance. His aged face bore a pale hue, his body more withered.

His wrinkles converged as he let out a faint laugh: “Only two strikes of the Buddha’s Killing Hand—my life has been drained for half a year. A waste, but with the late-stage Saint’s blood to replenish it, it is not a loss!”

He finished speaking. The terrifying blue hand instantly emitted a massive suction force, absorbing Jin Anhe’s blood before it could coalesce. The next moment, it appeared in Gu Tian Shu’s palm.

“Grand Ancestor, I was wrong!” A tangible soul emerged from the blue blood—Jin Anhe’s soul. His face bore entreaty, kneeling in the void with fear. Now he understood the vast gap between himself and Gu Tian Shu.

“Too late… the great age is coming. I must live a few more days to protect my descendants and Chenxi’s lineage. If you had retreated at the start, I would not have attacked you. But you repeatedly provoked me and killed my descendant. I cannot allow this!”

“Also, thank you for your blood. Absorbing it has extended my life a little!” Gu Tian Shu’s voice declared Jin Anhe’s death.

Meanwhile, Dongfang Zhenheng bore a playful expression. He seized Jin Jingtian and crushed him, golden divine blood scattering. Dongfang Zhenheng sent it to Gu Tian Shu’s presence.

“Good! One late-stage Saint, one early-stage Saint. This should allow me to live a few more years!” Gu Tian Shu chuckled, absorbing the blood of Jin Anhe and Jin Jingtian into his body.

“Hum…” A ripple spread. Gu Tian Shu’s pale face regained a touch of redness, his body reviving with vitality. Luotian and Dongfang Zhenheng were overjoyed.

The disciples of Tongtian Sect bore excitement. They had feared it was the end for their sect, but now they realized Grand Ancestor Gu Tian Shu had been beneath Tongtian Mountain all along. It was truly astonishing.

“Do you wish to try?” Gu Tian Shu gazed at Wang Jianzhou, his expression playful as if viewing a prey.

“Respectfully, I dare not. I shall do my utmost to help Grand Ancestor’s descendants rise!” Wang Jianzhou was thoroughly terrified. The previous Gu Tian Shu had been terrifying—two strikes to kill Jin Anhe, as if crushing an insect. It was truly frightening.

“Hum…” Before Gu Tian Shu could speak further, a crack echoed from his withered back. The character “Zhen” he had凝聚 earlier shattered, transforming into a whirlwind of wind that swept across the surroundings, rustling people’s robes.

Golden light flared. The golden character gradually shifted to a golden hue, casting Gu Tian Shu’s body in gold.

“Cursed heavens! Wait for me!” Gu Tian Shu’s calm gaze bore endless madness, his eyes fixed on the void. His voice carried intense resentment.

His body slightly bent, Gu Tian Shu instantly returned to his half-dead state. Luotian and Dongfang Zhenheng felt a deep sorrow.

“I must return now. I believe nothing in the Fire Domain can threaten you anymore!” Gu Tian Shu’s face bore a kind expression. He gazed at Luotian and Dongfang Zhenheng before his form slowly vanished from sight, reappearing in the desolate chamber beneath Tongtian Mountain.

“Hmph…” Luotian sighed deeply, a wave of exhaustion washing over him. These days’ battles had truly worn him out.

“Grand Ancestor’s final days—must bring the Gu family here to meet him!” Luotian made a decision. Though he had said he was married to Gu Qianshui, he ultimately did not bear the surname Gu.

“Luotian, we shall return now. From today, Tongtian Sect becomes the third major sect of the Fire Domain. If you have any matters or troubles, simply speak to Lu Han Tian—he will assist you!” Dongfang Zhenheng smiled as he addressed Luotian.

“Respectfully, I shall not accompany you!” Luotian bowed respectfully to Dongfang Zhenheng. In terms of lineage, Dongfang Zhenheng was indeed his elder.

“Good, Wang Xiong. We shall depart together!” Dongfang Zhenheng smiled as he addressed Wang Jianzhou and Du Hongtao, his eyes carrying a hint of joy.

“Good!” Wang Jianzhou naturally did not wish to linger. He and Dongfang Zhenheng bowed before Tongtian Mountain, then led Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian toward the outside of Tongtian Continent.

“Alas, it’s finally over!” Long Jie took a deep breath, collapsing to the ground dramatically as he muttered.
