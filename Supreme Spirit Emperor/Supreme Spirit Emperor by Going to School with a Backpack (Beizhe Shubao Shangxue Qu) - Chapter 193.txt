“By heaven, who is this youth? How could he be so powerful! Even a Supreme Realm master was felled by his single slap!” The onlookers involuntarily gasped, their voices filled with disbelief.

Ma Tongtian was no stranger in the Fire Domain; after all, Supreme Realm masters were rare there. Now that Luo Tian had felled Ma Tongtian with a single slap, his strength must be terrifying.

“Master! He must be an unheralded Saint’s Heir from a sect!” One voice called out, eyes burning as they gazed at Luo Tian standing before Ma Tongtian again. To them, such youth with such cultivation must have an extraordinary background—only the Saint’s Heirs of the three major sects could achieve such feats.

“This time, Ma Tongtian has truly met his match!” The onlookers murmured, watching as Luo Tian kicked Ma Tongtian in the abdomen again. Their faces lit up with excitement.

Crushing, absolute crushing. Luo Tian’s current strength rendered Supreme Realm masters mere playthings. Ma Tongtian had no chance to retaliate, and Luo Tian had already extracted his solid soul.

Golden runes suddenly surged upward, entwining Ma Tongtian’s soul. Luo Tian’s face twisted with cruelty: “How does it feel, huh?”

Luo Tian extended his hand slightly. The golden runes seeped into Ma Tongtian’s soul, mirroring the torment Ma Tongtian had inflicted on Longbao.

“Ah……” A piercing scream echoed through the firestorm, leaving the crowd stunned. Who would have thought a Supreme Realm master could be so easily stripped of his soul?

“I am from the Tengshan Sect, under the jurisdiction of the Sea Mountains Pavilion. If you kill me, the Sea Mountains Pavilion will not forgive you!” Ma Tongtian cried in agony. His gray soul, once solid, now faded under Luo Tian’s grip.

“Indeed, but will the Purple Crown Pavilion risk enmity with a half-Sage Realm master over one Supreme Realm?” Luo Tian’s eyes held contempt.

“Enough of this. Time to send you to your grave!” Luo Tian smiled, his fingers curling slightly.

But as he bent his finger, a powerful aura instantly locked onto him, making Luo Tian frown.

“Unexpectedly, Ma Tongtian couldn’t even match you. This kid must be quite the thorn in our side,” a mocking voice echoed. Four dark figures materialized before Luo Tian, causing his heart to race. His hand, poised to crush Ma Tongtian’s soul, froze mid-motion.

The four wore black robes, their faces cold and eyes fierce with arrogance. A familiar aura seeped into Luo Tian’s mind.

“Do we know each other? Or do we have a grudge?” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion. Though he couldn’t fathom their intent, the hostility radiating from them was unmistakable.

Chapter 879: The Opponents of the Star River Four Thieves

Amidst the endless firestorm, Luo Tian’s face bore a solemn expression. He still clutched Ma Tongtian’s soul, his gaze fixed on the four middle-aged men in black.

“Who are you? What quarrel do we have?” Luo Tian’s tone was grave, sensing the hostility radiating from them.

“Answer my question: where did you get that black ancient warship?” A man, clearly the leader, glared at Luo Tian with icy eyes, ignoring his half-Sage Realm status.

“An ancient warship?” Luo Tian’s mind stirred, his gaze shifting as he realized the reason for the familiar aura.

He now understood why the four had felt so eerily familiar. A bandit’s aura—yes, it was identical to that of Nan Gongxiu and Li Tianzhi. Luo Tian hadn’t expected this.

“Are you part of the Star River Four Thieves?” Luo Tian asked again, his voice heavy with suspicion. He had already guessed they were enemies of Nan Gongqing’s group. He recalled Nan Gongqing mentioning their dealings in other domains besides the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“We have no relation to the Star River Four Thieves, but what connection do you have with them?” The four spoke in unison, their auras locking onto Luo Tian.

“I am friends with Nan Gongqing!” Luo Tian replied softly, his voice laced with resignation. He knew a battle was inevitable.

“Hah! If you’re Nan Gongqing’s friend, then you can die!” The burly man barked, his voice carrying a blade. “He stole our business! If it weren’t for the Star River Four Thieves’ escape, they’d have killed those lowly brats long ago!”

The other three men’s eyes burned with murder, their weapons drawn as they lunged at Luo Tian.

“Scorpion! This kid has truly angered Scorpion! My heavens, these four Supreme Realm masters must be Scorpion’s leaders. I wonder how this half-Sage Realm master managed to offend Scorpion!” The crowd murmured, their faces awestruck as they watched the four black-robed Scorpion leaders.

Scorpion, like the Star River Four Thieves in the Four Sacred Star Domains, was a notorious bandit faction known for their cruelty. Hence, they were called Scorpion. To offend them was to risk even the Three Daoist Sects’ protection unless one remained hidden within those sects or fled to other domains. Though called bandits, they were more like assassins.

The four Supreme Realm masters attacked with apocalyptic force, their power swirling into a towering firestorm that surged toward Luo Tian.

“Four Supreme Realm masters? How dare you touch me! You’re truly desperate!” Luo Tian crushed Ma Tongtian’s soul in his hand, unafraid of their onslaught. His face bore confidence as he summoned a golden vortex in his dantian, channeling boundless golden saintly power into his fist. He launched a single punch.

“Boom!” Golden lightning crackled through the firestorm, its golden fist colliding with their attacks.

The first man’s blade shattered instantly under the punch, vanishing into nothingness. Yet the golden fist pressed on, charging toward the other three. The thunderous impact echoed across the heavens, turning the firestorm into a vacuum and revealing the blackened earth beneath.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The deafening sounds of collision rang out, shaking the onlookers.

In their sight, Scorpion’s four Supreme Realm leaders spat blood and recoiled in shock.

“One punch felled four Supreme Realm masters—Scorpion’s leaders! Who is this youth? Even the Saint’s Heirs of the Three Daoist Sects lack such power!” The crowd marveled, gazing at Luo Tian’s indifferent expression.

“I truly can’t fathom what courage you four Supreme Realm masters have to kill a half-Sage Realm. Who gave you such confidence?” Luo Tian sneered, his body flickering to appear before the man who had first attacked him. He delivered another punch.

A blue lightning crackled along Luo Tian’s arm, his fist striking with such force that the man would be left scarred at best.

“Another complete crushing! Four Supreme Realm masters, even against this youth, met their end. It’s truly unbelievable!” The crowd stirred with unease.

“Crack!” Another collision echoed as the man, a Scorpion leader, reacted swiftly. He gritted his teeth, summoning all his strength to punch back.

In the blink of an eye, the other three Scorpion leaders’ attacks arrived, their combined force striking Luo Tian’s back.

Though powerful, Luo Tian couldn’t afford to be careless against three Supreme Realm masters—especially those at the pinnacle of their realm. He turned, redirecting his punch to meet their assault.

The man seized the moment to retreat, vanishing from sight and reappearing before his comrades.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s figure materialized among the crowd, untouched by chaos.

“Not good. This kid is quite a thorn in our side. We’re no match for him!” A Supreme Realm master muttered, his gaze on Luo Tian’s formidable strength.

“We have no choice but to unleash our ultimate tactic. If we can’t kill him, we’ll retreat!” The Scorpion leader wiped his wound, his companions nodding in agreement.

They stood in the void, their hands moving swiftly to form seals.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, watching the four men as they chanted.

Their hands became blurs, weaving seals that summoned golden runes. The runes enveloped them, forming a colossal scorpion within the firestorm.

Its body dwarfed even Longjie’s dragon form, its maw chilling to the core. Its tail, glistening with menace, could end any Supreme Realm life in an instant.

The four leaders stood at the scorpion’s four corners, their faces twisted with mockery as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Kid, do you think we can’t handle you? If we couldn’t, why would we be here to play?” The leader’s voice echoed from the scorpion.

“Interesting,” Luo Tian mused, impressed by their combined formation.

“This scorpion’s strength is slightly superior to mine, but it still can’t kill me. Show me your tricks!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his aura surging as he unleashed the Sage power within him. His golden vortex spun at maximum speed, slicing through the firestorm to strike the scorpion with three punches.

“Arrogant!” The four Supreme Realm leaders glared at Luo Tian’s dismissal, their voices unified. Purple Supreme power coalesced into a dense aura, shimmering with golden light—clearly on the verge of becoming Sage power.

Two massive scorpion pincers, glowing ominously, met Luo Tian’s three punches.

The thunderous collision echoed again, sending shockwaves that forced the onlookers to retreat a thousand feet.

Longjie lifted Wang Xuanyang, who had nearly fainted, and followed the crowd away from the battlefield. He knew he could do nothing to aid Luo Tian against these four.

Wang Xuanyang stirred, his eyes widening at Longjie’s youthful face. He felt a surge of confusion before his mind buzzed with ringing, and his blood churned in response to the thunderous impact. A streak of blood escaped his lips.

“This…?” Wang Xuanyang had thought he was doomed in Ma Tongtian’s grasp, but not only had he survived, Longjie stood unharmed before him. He was momentarily stunned.

“My brother has arrived!” Longjie understood Wang Xuanyang’s confusion and explained, his gaze returning to the raging firestorm.

“Hum…” The endless firestorm gradually calmed, revealing Luo Tian’s figure. The four men’s scorpion form also emerged from the flames.

Luo Tian’s face paled slightly, his expression grave. He hadn’t expected their combined strength to be so formidable.

“Kid! Die!” The man who had transformed into the scorpion’s tail lunged forward, his weapon slicing at Luo Tian’s waist.

The tail hook, like an extended reaper’s sickle, cut through Luo Tian’s midsection. Golden blood spattered the air.

“Kid! You still have arrogance? Even if you’re a Saint’s Heir, we’ll cut you down!” The man sneered, licking the golden saintly blood from his blade.

“Half-Sage Realm’s blood—tastes good!” The man grinned, his voice brimming with arrogance.

Luo Tian’s body seemed severed at the waist, revealing bone through his torn flesh. Longjie clenched his fists, his face contorted with anguish.

“Careless,” Luo Tian muttered, his gaze wary as he faced the colossal scorpion. That strike had wounded him severely.

“Seems I must use my full strength against four Supreme Realm masters. It’s embarrassing,” Luo Tian sighed, his golden vortex reversing as his saintly power turned black.

“Kid! Die!” Sensing Luo Tian’s injury, the four men shouted in unison. Black demonic energy surged as they attacked.

Black demonic aura engulfed the area, pushing back the firestorm. Luo Tian’s figure emerged, his face twisted with a sinister smile. His formidable body healed within the demonic aura.

Feeling their overwhelming attack, Luo Tian didn’t even summon his demon sword. He extended both hands, forming two black hands that grabbed the scorpion’s pincers.

“Break!” Luo Tian roared, his arms straining as he tore the pincers apart.

“Crack!” The sound of breaking echoed, and the two Supreme Realm pincers were torn apart by Luo Tian’s black hands.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he turned to the man who had transformed into the tail hook. “For years, you’re the first to dare drink my blood. Give it back!”

He summoned his seventh demon sword, its blade slicing through the air. The massive blade clashed with the tail hook.

With two pincers destroyed, the four’s formation was half-broken, their power diminished.

Luo Tian’s seventh demon sword’s fifth strike could annihilate a Supreme Realm master, its power so immense it was described as destroying the heavens.

The blade struck the tail hook, sending black energy cascading outward and crushing the endless firestorm. The tail hook shattered instantly.

The man who had transformed into the tail hook had no chance to resist, vanishing in the blade’s wake.

A vast rift split the sky, as if cleaving heaven itself. The onlookers trembled in awe.

“Is this the strength of a half-Sage Realm? It’s terrifying!” The crowd murmured, their eyes filled with reverence as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Who is this youth? He’s not a Saint’s Heir of the Three Daoist Sects. Why do I feel he surpasses them?” Those who had seen the Three Daoist Sect’s Saint’s Heirs whispered in awe.

“Who is this man?” The crowd’s faces bore confusion, speculating on Luo Tian’s identity. His immense power and the presence of a dragon clan bloodline made it impossible for him to be unknown in the Fire Domain.

Yet Luo Tian remained unaware of their thoughts, and even if he knew, he wouldn’t care. His gaze fell on the remaining scorpion leader’s form, his black demon sword raised again for the sixth strike.

The scorpion leader’s face was filled with terror, his eyes wild as he saw his comrades slain by Luo Tian. But he knew the remaining three couldn’t match Luo Tian’s strength.

Feeling Luo Tian’s overwhelming demon sword, the scorpion leader’s eyes turned blood-red. He waved his hand, and a golden armor appeared before him.

“Elder Er, Elder San, come here!” The leader called to the two men who had transformed into pincers. He had already decided to flee, for Luo Tian was now unstoppable.

The golden armor radiated a sacred glow—clearly a holy artifact. It was the four brothers’ only holy artifact. Now, the leader summoned it to block Luo Tian’s blade.

“Foolish as a mayfly,” Luo Tian said coldly, raising his sword again. The sixth strike of the Seven Demon Blades was about to be unleashed. He knew the fifth strike might wound them, but it wouldn’t kill them. To eliminate three with a holy artifact, only the sixth strike would suffice.

The other two Supreme Realm masters responded to their leader’s call, their默契 (unspoken understanding) evident. They moved swiftly to join their elder behind the golden armor.

“Hum…” The golden armor glowed fiercely, its runes flashing as it shielded the three.

At the same time, they channeled their Supreme power into the armor, amplifying its strength.

The black blade struck the golden armor, and the sky darkened. Golden runes exploded outward.

Behind the armor, the three scorpion leaders’ faces were pale with hatred as they channeled more power. The armor emitted a piercing hum, space tremors surrounding them as they vanished into the void.

“Flee?” Luo Tian wouldn’t let them escape so easily. His sixth strike surged into the still-opening rift.

The black blade, radiating overwhelming power, arrived at the three men who had fled into the star domain.

“Ah…” The three men’s faces twisted with madness, their final effort to block the blade. They knew if they failed, they would meet the same fate as their fourth comrade.

“Block it! We must self-destruct! Golden Thread Armor, explode!” The leader’s eyes burned blood-red as he shouted. The stars trembled with his command.

Self-destructing a holy artifact—these three were truly cornered. Holy artifacts were rare, and in the absence of a Sage Realm master, one with a holy artifact would dominate without it. Yet now, the leader used his to block Luo Tian’s sixth strike.

“Explosive!” A deafening explosion shattered stars, its power destroying the heavens. The collision of two immense forces annihilated the scorpion leaders and their armor, leaving countless stars to vanish in the clash.

The wind howled through the firestorm, rustling the onlookers’ robes.

The crowd stared in awe at Luo Tian amidst the black smoke, their faces filled with reverence. At this moment, he seemed like a demon lord, one to be worshipped.

“Terrifying! Even a Sage Realm master might be injured by this youth’s strike alone! That was the power of a holy artifact explosion, yet it only blocked his blade!” The crowd murmured, watching Luo Tian approach Longjie and Wang Xuanyang.

Wang Xuanyang was stunned, having already regarded Luo Tian highly but never imagining he could be this strong. Four Supreme Realm masters—one dead, three missing—his overwhelming power made Wang Xuanyang no longer dare call him brother.

“Wang Xiong, you’ve been through much. I apologize for involving you. Rest assured, I’ll compensate you!” Luo Tian smiled, his body emerging from the demonic state. His golden saintly power flowed into Wang Xuanyang’s body, mending his wounds.

“…Alright…” Wang Xuanyang hadn’t expected Luo Tian to still call him “Wang Xiong,” leaving him stunned.

“Don’t worry, my brother won’t let you down!” Longjie patted Wang Xuanyang’s shoulder, grateful for his earlier cover.

“Let’s go to Tengshan Sect. From today on, Tengshan Sect belongs to Wang!” Golden light flashed as Luo Tian vanished with Wang Xuanyang and Longjie.

“Wang Xuanyang truly has luck! With such a strong protector, no one in the Fire Domain could control this youth except the Three Daoist Sects!” The crowd sighed, watching the three disappear.

Chapter 880: Holy Artifact Self-Explosion

Amidst the endless firestorm, countless figures gathered, sensing the clash of Supreme Realm masters. They rushed to witness this rare battle.

The firestorm roared as the black scorpion’s tail hook, like a reaper’s sickle, slashed toward Luo Tian.

The tail hook appeared abruptly, and even Luo Tian only saw a black flash before feeling a chill at his waist. His face turned pale.

Luo Tian’s reaction was swift, but it was too late. The tail hook sliced into his waist, embedding deeply into his flesh. Golden blood spattered the air.

“Kid! You still have arrogance? Even if you’re a Saint’s Heir, we’ll cut you down!” The man sneered, licking the golden saintly blood from his blade.

“Half-Sage Realm’s blood—tastes good!” The man grinned, his voice brimming with arrogance.

Luo Tian’s body seemed severed at the waist, bones visible through his torn flesh. Longjie clenched his fists, his face contorted with anguish.

“Careless,” Luo Tian muttered, his gaze wary as he faced the colossal scorpion. That strike had wounded him severely.

“Seems I must use my full strength against four Supreme Realm masters. It’s embarrassing,” Luo Tian sighed, his golden vortex reversing as his saintly power turned black.

“Kid! Die!” Sensing Luo Tian’s injury, the four men shouted in unison. Black demonic energy surged as they attacked.

Black demonic aura engulfed the area, pushing back the firestorm. Luo Tian’s figure emerged, his face twisted with a sinister smile. His formidable body healed within the demonic aura.

Feeling their overwhelming attack, Luo Tian didn’t even summon his demon sword. He extended both hands, forming two black hands that grabbed the scorpion’s pincers.

“Break!” Luo Tian roared, his arms straining as he tore the pincers apart.

“Crack!” The sound of breaking echoed, and the two Supreme Realm pincers were torn apart by Luo Tian’s black hands.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he turned to the man who had transformed into the tail hook. “For years, you’re the first to dare drink my blood. Give it back!”

“Don’t worry, my brother won’t let you down!” Longjie patted Wang Xuanyang’s shoulder, grateful for his earlier cover.

“Let’s go to Tengshan Sect. From today on, Tengshan Sect belongs to Wang!” Golden light flashed as Luo Tian vanished with Wang Xuanyang and Longjie.

“Wang Xuanyang truly has luck! With such a strong protector, no one in the Fire Domain could control this youth except the Three Daoist Sects!” The crowd sighed, watching the three disappear.

Chapter 881: Ambition

Tengshan Sect lay in the southern part of the Fire Domain, ruling over millions of miles. In this hellish realm, it stood as an absolute hegemon, its sect master Ma Tongtian a renowned Supreme Realm master. Thus, Tengshan Sect ranked among the top five in the Fire Domain.

Now, Luo Tian and Longjie stood beneath the stars outside Tengshan Sect’s vast land.

“Luo… Luo Tian… perhaps it’s best to give up. I’m not worthy…” Wang Xuanyang trembled, his face filled with anxiety. When Luo Tian declared that Tengshan Sect would now belong to Wang, he had already guessed what Luo Tian intended. Now, standing before Tengshan’s gates, his suspicions were confirmed.

“Luo Tian wants to seize Tengshan Sect for himself!” The thought of such a reckless plan made Wang Xuanyang’s heart race.

“Show some courage! You’ll be the sect master of this million-mile domain soon. This isn’t good enough!” Longjie shrugged, patting Wang Xuanyang’s shoulder to ease his tension.

“Wait here,” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Wang Xuanyang.

Luo Tian’s motive for seizing Tengshan Sect wasn’t merely to repay Wang Xuanyang. Even he doubted his ability to control a whole continent. But he had considered much, especially the nine elders in the Netherworld and the impending disaster across the Nine Star Domains. Alone, the Four Sacred Star Domains’ strength was insufficient.

Thus, Luo Tian planned to establish his own forces in other domains while searching for Chen Yunting. Though complicated, if these forces grew strong enough, they could eventually unite to counter the Netherworld.

As he spoke, Luo Tian surged into Tengshan Sect’s land, a smile on his face. His gaze fell upon the towering mountain at the domain’s heart—clearly Ma Tongtian’s former stronghold.

“Kill only those loyal to Ma Tongtian,” Luo Tian smiled, vanishing into the clouds and appearing atop the sky-high Tengshan Mountain.

“One day, I’ll defy heaven!” But as soon as he arrived, a grand aura surged into his mind.

From the mountain’s height, eight characters were carved into its vast body—radiating a sacred aura that made Luo Tian’s eyes narrow.

“Majestic!” The first impression of the eight characters was their overwhelming power. Who dared say such words against heaven? Heaven was an enigmatic force, especially to cultivators who revered it. No one had dared speak such words before.

The sacred power clearly came from a Sage Realm master, not just an early-stage one. Luo Tian’s mind raced with possibilities.

“Could Tengshan Sect have a Sage Realm master?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, staring at the eight characters written in bold strokes. For a moment, he hesitated to act.

“Who dares hover over my Tengshan Sect?” A voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Three nine-source Heaven’s Sovereign elders, their faces cold and eyes sharp, materialized instantly to surround him.

“Who are you? Don’t be foolish and retreat!” One elder spoke, his voice laced with authority. Clearly a high-ranking figure in Tengshan Sect, his aura surpassed ordinary nine-source masters.

“Your killer!” Luo Tian didn’t fear Sage Realm masters, but he wouldn’t be intimidated by a few words. He summoned his golden hand instantly, seizing the elder and staring at Tengshan Mountain’s vast body. If anything went wrong, he would flee immediately.

Luo Tian’s strike captured one nine-source elder instantly, causing the three to panic. They hadn’t expected this seemingly harmless youth to be a Supreme Realm master.

“You!” The captured elder’s face paled. Ma Tongtian was gone, and he was now the highest-ranking in Tengshan Sect. Yet even he couldn’t resist Luo Tian’s grip—something Ma Tongtian himself hadn’t achieved.

Feeling no threat, Luo Tian smiled and squeezed the elder’s body into a blood mist. The corpse fell from the sky, staining Tengshan Mountain red.

“Huh? What is this?” A six-source disciple wiped his face, seeing blood on his hands. He felt the scent of blood and his face turned pale.

“Blood! Someone is dead! Enemy attack!” The disciple shouted, staring at the sky before his body tensed and shot upward.

The disciple’s presence echoed like a thunderclap through Tengshan Sect, causing all disciples to pause their tasks and gaze at the sky. They saw two nine-source Heaven’s Sovereign elders, and they all leaped toward them.

“Ten thousand… a million…” In moments, one hundred thousand core disciples of Tengshan Sect stood behind the two nine-source elders. More and more figures gathered, spreading the news of an enemy attack across Tengshan Domain.

Luo Tian killed one nine-source elder but didn’t continue his slaughter. He folded his arms, waiting in the sky.

He knew Tengshan Domain was entirely loyal to Ma Tongtian, so he waited for all disciples to gather before eliminating them.

Time passed slowly. The two elders’ disciples grew more numerous, and as their numbers increased, the elders felt a surge of courage.

Luo Tian smiled, watching the four to five million disciples behind the two nine-source elders. He sighed, impressed by the Fire Domain’s strength compared to the Four Sacred Star Domains. Even Tengshan Sect was comparable to Tianyuan Sect.

“Kid, even if you’re strong, can you fight against millions of us?” The elder who had been terrified earlier glared at Luo Tian.

“Hah! Your sect master Ma Tongtian is dead. Will you still fight for him?” Luo Tian replied coldly, his voice echoing through the millions of ears.

His words struck like thunder among Tengshan Sect disciples, leaving them stunned.

“How could it be? Our sect master dead? Just because you say so, it’s a lie!” The elder scoffed.

Before he finished speaking, a disciple flew from the ground, his voice trembling: “Master… the sect master’s talisman is broken!”

“Hush…” The murmurs spread. Tengshan Sect disciples stared at each other, stunned. They hadn’t expected their Supreme Realm master Ma Tongtian to be killed.

Clearly, this youth had a connection with Ma Tongtian’s death. He was likely the one who killed him.

“Did you kill our sect master?” A nine-source elder asked, trembling.

“Yes. And I won’t spare anyone who resists!” Luo Tian’s face was cold, a chill spreading through their hearts. Though facing millions, he remained calm and composed.

“Even if Ma Tongtian is dead, it doesn’t mean you can take over!” One nine-source elder’s eyes flashed with anger. The other, however, looked puzzled and contemplative.

“Idiot! Do you think a mere nine-source can control Tengshan Sect?” Luo Tian saw the elder’s intent and sneered.

Indeed, without Ma Tongtian, there was only one other elder—this one and his companion. They were the strongest in Tengshan Sect, their voices carrying weight. They were the only ones who could succeed as sect master.

“Tengshan Sect disciples, form the Tengshan Formation and kill this criminal who killed our sect master!” The elder who had hesitated earlier shouted, his voice laced with persuasion.

“I choose to submit!” The elder who had looked contemplative sighed, bowing respectfully to Luo Tian.

The shouting elder heard his companion’s words and gaped in disbelief, his face filled with anger. “Song Yongkang! What do you mean?”

“Nothing. I just want to live!” Song Yongkang’s gaze was calm as he looked at the elder.

“Me too… I also…” Some disciples in Tengshan Sect weren’t foolish. They saw through the shouting elder’s intent and refused to fight for him.

“Niu Hongyun, trust me. You should submit too; otherwise, you’ll regret it!” Song Yongkang spoke calmly but without much hope. He was merely urging Niu Hongyun to submit.

Chapter 882: Bloodbath at Tengshan Sect

Above Tengshan Sect’s sky, millions of disciples stood in confusion behind the two nine-source elders. They didn’t know what Song Yongkang and Niu Hongyun were up to—whether one chose to submit or the other aimed to kill this youth who had slain their sect master.

“Song Yongkang, what do you mean?” Niu Hongyun’s face was filled with anger. He hadn’t expected Song Yongkang to undermine him.
