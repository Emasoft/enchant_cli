“Indeed, I was the first to arrive. Unexpectedly, upon arrival, I found Ding Xiaoyan here furious and striking people—truly worth the journey!” Su Yewu's lips curled slightly, her gaze sweeping over Luo Tian before she smiled and stepped forward toward Ding Xiaoyan.

Luo Tian was struck by her gaze, not due to the woman’s seductive eyes but in awe of her cultivation—she too had reached the Bone-Transformation Initial Stage, a level rivaling Ding Xiaoyan’s dual-element constitution.

Ding Xiaoyan and Su Yewu locked eyes, an unusual aura forming between them like needles against a blade.

“Ha! Unexpectedly, Yewu sister arrived first. We didn’t come late, did we?” A loud laugh echoed from the distance as several figures approached.

“You didn’t arrive late at all. Perfect timing to witness a spectacle—Ding Xiaoyan is furious and currently venting her anger!” Su Yewu smiled, addressing the approaching youths.

“Xiaoyan sister, who angered you?” A man in white robes, his back bearing a long sword, stepped forward and asked gently.

Ding Xiaoyan’s face lit with relief before a flush rose to her cheeks, her former arrogance vanishing as she收回双鞭 and murmured, “Senior Dong Xing, you’ve arrived!”

“Ah, how sweetly you address Senior Dong Xing!” Su Yewu remarked with a smirk.

“Ha! Yewu sister remains as beautiful as ever. It’s been ages—did you miss me, Huo大哥?” The laughter echoed as three figures entered Luo Tian’s courtyard.

Luo Tian observed them closely, astonishment swelling within him—were all the youths of the Eastern Region so formidable? Even in the secular city, they had reached Bone-Transformation Initial Stage.

“Enough! Since we’ve all arrived, it’s been a while. Let us gather and celebrate!” A burly youth spoke.

“Indeed, it’s been a long time!” His companion, bearing seven-tenths of his features, smiled in agreement. The resemblance was unmistakable.

The third youth radiated an aloof aura, standing apart from the others like a foreigner.

“Indeed, we should gather! But first, there’s a minor issue to resolve,” the man called Senior Dong Xing said coldly, his gaze turning to Luo Tian. As they spoke, Ding Xiaoyan had relayed their conflict through her spiritual awareness.

“What issue?” The burly youth frowned impatiently. “Let’s finish this quickly—there’s wine to drink!”

“Ah… Senior Dong Xing, you’ve already started flirting! Can’t you be more discreet?” Su Yewu mocked lightly.

“Su Yewu, don’t provoke me. I advise against a duel now,” Ding Xiaoyan’s battle-readiness flared as she glared at Su Yewu.

“I’m terrified,” Su Yewu mockingly patted her chest, leaving everyone stunned—including Luo Tian.

“Hmph!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, her displeasure evident as Dong Xing’s gaze shifted to Luo Tian.

“Hmph!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, her displeasure evident as Dong Xing’s gaze shifted to Luo Tian.

“Look what? I said it for you!” Ding Xiaoyan’s face darkened, comparing the two—Dong Xing seemed to hover above Luo Tian. She wondered why she’d ever deigned to argue with such a person, feeling her dignity lowered.

“I’m busy!” Luo Tian snorted, sensing the youth’s intent to impress Ding Xiaoyan.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian reached his limit, vowing to unleash the seal if the youth overstepped—those arrogant youths would be unrecognizable.

“Your temper’s fierce. Xiaoyan, is this your servant?” Dong Xing’s eyes flashed coldly, the first time anyone had spoken to him thus.

“This isn’t a servant—this fool’s arrogant! A mere Body-Transformation Ninth Stage cultivator dared challenge me. If my father hadn’t intervened, he’d already be crushed!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered.

“Cut off your hands and apologize, or I’ll strike—once I do, those hands will be gone forever!” Dong Xing’s face was cold.

The others frowned; though his words were harsh, they knew Dong Xing was their strongest—his name mirrored his nature: a sharp sword with terrifying attacks.

Ding Xiaoyan, forgetting Luo Tian was her father’s guest, smiled sweetly at Dong Xing, her eyes soft.

“Three breaths—leave… or face the consequences!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, his killing intent radiating. He’d decided to end this—geniuses weren’t strangers to him, and he knew some matters couldn’t be tolerated twice.

Chapter 324: Greed

Luo Tian’s words chilled the hearts of the city lords’ offspring, leaving them stunned. They’d never seen Dong Xing rebuked so boldly by a mere Body-Transformation Ninth Stage cultivator.

“Does this fool not know? Dong Xing was inducted into the Heavenly Sword Sect as an exceptional student, immediately becoming an inner sect disciple under a Spirit-Transformation master!” The burly man growled.

“Huo Zhiyong, is this true?” Su Yewu asked, her seductive face shocked.

“Of course!” Ding Xiaoyan’s face gleamed with pride, gazing at the others.

“Hum…” Dong Xing’s aura surged, a sharp pressure pressing toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian frowned; Dong Xing felt like an unsheathed blade, its attack a storm.

“Boy, you’ve guts!” Dong Xing’s face was cold as he stepped forward like a god looking down on an ant.

“You’re the first to speak thus to me, so you’ve succeeded in angering me!” Dong Xing didn’t wait for Luo Tian to respond, advancing steadily. The world seemed to tremble beneath him.

“Oh, you’re not the first to speak thus to me—but their fates weren’t as simple as losing hands. You want to sever my hands? I’ll break your limbs!” Luo Tian’s face darkened.

“Die!” Dong Xing sneered, golden light flickering from his hands as he struck.

“Leave… this level of attack can’t harm me!” Luo Tian barked, golden light erupting from his fist to meet the golden palm.

The collision erupted in a thunderous roar, golden energy scattering and shaking their robes.

“Good!” Dong Xing spoke, his body flickering as golden energy surged from him toward Luo Tian.

“Seems today won’t end peacefully!” Luo Tian inwardly sneered, his Rupture Spear steadied in hand. He moved with no fear, golden long dragons meeting Dong Xing’s assault.

“Hmph! Foolish—can’t even beat me, yet dare challenge Senior Dong Xing? Where’s your confidence from?” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, watching Luo Tian clash with Dong Xing.

The others watched with interest, curious about Luo Tian’s abilities to face a Bone-Transformation Initial Stage cultivator at Body-Transformation Ninth.

But soon, their expressions turned shocked—Body-Transformation vs. Bone-Transformation? Impossible, yet it was happening before their eyes.

“This boy truly has talent!”

“Indeed, if I were Body-Transformation Ninth, I’d lose to him!” The two Huo brothers exchanged glances, their faces grim.

“Unfortunately, he’s still Body-Transformation—see how Dong Xing hasn’t even drawn his sword?” Su Yewu sighed, watching Luo Tian hold his ground despite being at a disadvantage.

“Boom…” Dong Xing’s fist struck, his body retreating with a hint of surprise. A Body-Transformation Ninth cultivator matching him this long was unprecedented.

“Good, but that’s all. You’ve earned my sword—let me show you my ultimate state!” Dong Xing’s lips curled, his hand gripping the sword on his back.

Luo Tian’s lips curled, coldly replying: “You’ve earned the right to witness my ultimate state. Though this opportunity was wasted, I’ll reclaim it from you. I said you’d sever my hands—so I’ll break your limbs!”

“Foolish dream! Dragon Xuan Sword!” Dong Xing sneered, yanking his sword free.

“Hum…” The hum resonated, echoing with dragon roars, as if releasing a giant beast.

“Unexpectedly, Dong Xing has drawn his sword! This boy is doomed—this is the first time I’ve seen Dong Xing use Dragon Xuan Sword against a Body-Transformation Ninth!” Huo Zhiyong sighed, watching the sharp sword.

“Indeed, this blade has been with him since childhood. Legend says he even slept holding it. Ding Xiaoyan, you might lose favor!” Su Yewu teased Ding Xiaoyan with a laugh.

“Hmph!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, but couldn’t deny the truth.

“High-grade Spirit-Transformation?” Luo Tian assessed Dragon Xuan Sword’s rank, his face calm. The Dragon Emperor’s逆鳞 (Reverse Scale) rested in his hand.

“Roar…” The reverse scale emitted a proud dragon roar, its overwhelming pressure crushing Dragon Xuan Sword.

“Hum…” The sword hummed, fear resonating from it.

“What is that scale?” Huo Zhiyong asked, puzzled.

“Don’t know.”

“It’s Dragon Reverse Scale!” The silent black-cloaked youth finally spoke, his face shocked as he gazed at the scale.

“What? Cold Fei, repeat that!” Huo Zhiwu’s face was stunned, staring at the scale.

As city lords’ offspring, they’d heard of Dragon Reverse Scale—yet it was in Luo Tian’s hands, ordinary yet radiating golden light.

Ding Xiaoyan furrowed her brows; she’d seen the scale before but hadn’t realized it was a legendary treasure. A bad premonition stirred—this annoying man wasn’t as simple as he seemed.

“Perfect, my Dragon Xuan Sword needs dragon energy to refine—your scale’s aura might elevate it to a Domain-level weapon!” Dong Xing’s face lit with joy, soothing his sword while greedily eyeing the golden scale.

“Die!” Luo Tian sneered, slamming the reverse scale onto his Nihilation Dragon Seal.

Chapter 325: The Three Dragon Strikes

“Roar…” A dragon’s cry echoed in their minds, golden light forming a dragon-shaped illusion before the stunned crowd.

“Boom…” The dragon child crashed onto the ground, his innocent face wary as he glanced at the youths.

“He’s the one who sealed it within this boy!” Ding Xiaoyan gasped, watching the red-clothed dragon child.

“This boy is no ordinary!” They all thought, gazing at the adorable figure.

“Big brother, you’ve come out so often lately—I haven’t even woken up yet!” The dragon child spoke innocently, annoyed.

“Big brother’s going to beat someone—go play elsewhere!” Luo Tian handed the dragon child several storage bags and vials of pills from his ring.

“Okay!” The dragon child glanced at the youths, finding no formidable opponents, and happily took the bags before heading off.

“Unexpectedly, you brought a child into battle—truly hopeless!” Dong Xing sneered, his sword humming but even he sensed its fear of Luo Tian.

“Big brother, take that sword and destroy it—it’s stained with our clan’s blood!” The dragon child played with a gem, hearing Dong Xing’s words and seeing the sword. His face saddened.

Luo Tian was shocked—this Dragon Xuan Sword had once stained dragon blood.

“Alright, I’ll do it!” Luo Tian smiled, his power surging.

“Bone-Transformation Initial… Bone-Transformation Intermediate…” In two breaths, his power leaped to Bone-Transformation Intermediate.

“Wow! He’s actually Bone-Transformation Intermediate—always hiding his power!” Huo Zhiyong was stunned.

Others were equally shocked, realizing Luo Tian had been suppressing his power against Dong Xing.

Ding Xiaoyan’s face trembled; she’d never imagined Luo Tian had held back so much. A wave of humiliation surged, making her nearly unbearable.

Dong Xing smiled but was mentally wary: “Now that’s interesting—Bone-Transformation Intermediate. I’ve fought many, but this alone won’t let you be arrogant!”

“Give me that broken sword and cut off your hands—today I’ll let you go. Don’t force me to act!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, savoring this power.

“Dream on!” Dong Xing sneered, his sword dancing as he lunged at Luo Tian.

“You still treat me as Body-Transformation Ninth? You had the chance but wasted it—now I’ll act myself!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly, his Bone-Transformation Intermediate power exploding. His Rupture Spear struck Dong Xing like lightning.

“Sizzle…” A fiery sound echoed as the spear and sword clashed in midair.

Luo Tian blocked Dragon Xuan Sword, his fists brimming with golden energy as he struck Dong Xing.

This punch unleashed all of Luo Tian’s Bone-Transformation Intermediate power. At this moment, he was far stronger than Dong Xing; speed and strength reached their peak. As Dong Xing marveled at his sword being effortlessly blocked, a terrifying golden fist struck his chest.

“Puke…” Dong Xing’s ribs cracked with a clear sound, blood spewing as he flew backward, landing in a heap.

“Wow!”

“A single punch sent Dong Xing flying and wounded him!”

“I’ve never seen Dong Xing so helpless!” The Huo brothers stared in disbelief at Luo Tian standing proudly.

Ding Xiaoyan was stunned, watching Luo Tian and the fallen Dong Xing, her face showing concern.

“I told you not to push me!” Luo Tian approached Dong Xing, his foot raised high and slammed onto Dong Xing’s face.

“Don’t!” Ding Xiaoyan’s face turned frantic, her twin whips in hand as she rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The stone ground shattered under Luo Tian’s foot, and Dong Xing vanished from the spot.

“That’s more like it!” Dong Xing’s face twisted with grimace, still clutching his sword despite being struck.

“Good!” Luo Tian smiled, watching Dong Xing stand.

“I’ll not only break your hands but also cut off the foot you wanted to stomp!” Dong Xing declared, his ribs bleeding green.

“They thought I only had a gold-element constitution, but besides my father, no one knows I have a dual-element one—because they’re not worthy of me using the wood-element energy!” Dong Xing sneered, his body radiating green and golden energy.

“Oh… so what?” Luo Tian remained indifferent, calm.

“His dual-element constitution!” Huo Zhiyong gasped, stunned by Dong Xing’s depth.

Ding Xiaoyan halted mid-run, her face shocked—she hadn’t known Dong Xing had hidden this from her.

“So what? You underestimate me? I admit you’re strong, but a single gold-element Bone-Transformation Intermediate can’t beat me!” Dong Xing sneered.

“Dragon Strike, First Strike!” Dong Xing roared, his sword transforming into a golden dragon attacking Luo Tian.

“Interesting!” Luo Tian smiled, his golden serpent emerging from the Rupture Spear to clash with the dragon.

“Boom…” The courtyard was filled with golden light, thunderous echoes.

Chapter 326: Trampling You Is No Problem

Seeing his first strike blocked effortlessly, Dong Xing showed no surprise—Bone-Transformation Intermediate was formidable. He hadn’t deluded himself into thinking one move would defeat Luo Tian.

He used the first strike to prepare for the second.

The sword moved rhythmically, its energy—wood and gold—flowing into Dragon Xuan Sword.

Dragon Xuan Sword’s golden light surged, a terrifying aura radiating from it.

“Unexpectedly, Dong Xing can already wield the second move of Dragon Strike—last time I saw him, he hadn’t mastered it. Just under a year, and he’s already achieved this!” Huo Zhiwu sighed.

“Legend says the second move of Dragon Strike is the most powerful. The third may only be mastered by Dong Xing’s elder brother. With his talent, he might master the third!”

“Yet we wonder how this boy will survive the second move. If he does, none of us would match him!” They whispered.

Luo Tian observed the massive sword energy forming above, his face grim—this aura radiated terror. Using only gold-element energy wouldn’t suffice.

“Today, let’s end this—let these arrogant ones despair!” Luo Tian inwardly roared, his three-element energy subtly activated. Even against this terrifying sword energy, he wouldn’t reveal his five-element constitution—three were enough for these people.

“Three-element constitution?” Su Yewu’s eyes widened, staring at Luo Tian.

“He’s been holding back!” Cold Fei’s calm face showed disbelief.

As they spoke, the massive sword formed above, Dong Xing’s face twisted with arrogance, his aura rippling outward. A transcendent aura radiated from him.

“Dragon Strike, Second Move—Concentrated Sword Energy!” He roared, the sword energy filling the sky. The golden dragon descended like a meteor, radiating terror toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s body surged with three-element energy, gathering around him. Three bone fragments glowed faintly; his eyes held arrogance, as if he were the world’s ruler, facing the sword energy.

“Die!” Seeing Luo Tian not even use a technique to block his attack, Dong Xing’s face lit with joy.

“This fool—how dare he try to block with his body?” The youths were stunned, seeing Luo Tian as a fool.

“Hmph! Arrogant!” Ding Xiaoyan sneered, waiting for Luo Tian to be split in half.

“Boom…” The sound echoed through the city lord’s mansion, shaking the stone ground and lifting it. Dust obscured their vision.

In Ding’s reception hall, several Bone-Transformation Peak elders sat chatting when the explosion echoed.

“Probably a few juniors practicing,” one with a beard said, shaking his head with a smile.

Hearing this, Ding Yuanshan and others smiled—but when Ding Yuanshan sensed it, his face turned grave. The sound came from Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Hope you don’t provoke this boy—else, it’ll be your loss!” Ding Yuanshan sighed, looking at the other city lords.

“Let’s go see the spectacle—these juniors seem to have gone too far!” A white-cloaked elder smiled, the father of Dong Xing, Dong Zimmo.

Dong Zimmo had confidence in his son—among peers, no one could match him.

“Good! I’d like to see how these juniors have improved this year!” Ding Yuanshan sighed, speaking aloud.

The elders smiled, stepping out of the hall toward the courtyard where the explosion echoed.

“How is he?” Huo Zhiyong asked, his face tense.

“Hmph! Arrogant fool—daring to block my sword energy with his body? Even a three-element genius can’t match me!” Dong Xing’s face showed pride.

“Sigh…” The youths inhaled sharply, stunned by Dong Xing’s audacity—carving bones into a sword? Dragon Xuan Sword was already an advanced weapon, enhanced by his bone. How terrifying!

Feeling their shocked gazes, Dong Xing’s face showed disdain. He used his ultimate state to humble others. His lips curled: “The Concentrated Sword Energy I just used is nearly as strong as a Domain-level technique!”

His tone was calm, but arrogance was clear. They couldn’t deny Dong Xing’s talent.

Ding Xiaoyan gazed at Dong Xing, her eyes full of admiration.

“Let’s go drink—this fool is surely injured!” Dong Xing, seeing no movement in the dust, strode toward the broken gate.

As he stepped out, a cold voice echoed: “Leaving so soon?”

The dust cleared, revealing a battered youth, panting, his eyes coldly staring at Dong Xing’s back. His hands moved swiftly, forming complex seals.

“Soul-Stealing Seal!” Luo Tian’s hands moved, his soul seal erupting.

Luo Tian’s current soul strength was comparable to Spirit-Transformation Initial Stage, so his Soul-Stealing Seal was several times stronger. A clear “soul” seal surged toward Dong Xing’s head.

“Yelp!” A scream echoed as Dong Xing was struck by lightning, flying backward and colliding with a wall.

Before they reacted, Luo Tian appeared like a whirlwind before Dong Xing, his foot striking again—but this time, Dong Xing could not escape.

Chapter 327: Dragon Baby’s Transformation

“You said you’d sever my hands and feet—dare to do it?” Luo Tian’s foot crushed Dong Xing’s face, his voice cold.

Seeing Dong Xing trampled under Luo Tian, others’ lips twitched—Dong Xing was indeed unlucky to be so humiliated.

“I’ll kill you!” Ding Xiaoyan’s face twisted with fury, her twin whips in hand as she rushed toward Luo Tian.

Seeing Ding Xiaoyan approach, Luo Tian sneered: “Go… I’ve let you too long. If it weren’t for your father, I’d have beaten you eight hundred times!”

Luo Tian, fed up with Ding Xiaoyan’s antics, finally exploded. He grabbed her whips and pulled them toward him.

Ding Xiaoyan’s delicate body couldn’t withstand Luo Tian’s Bone-Transformation Intermediate strength—she flew toward him like an arrow.

Luo Tian showed no mercy, his foot striking her abdomen, sending her back with a bloodstain.

“Come and go swiftly!” Su Qianwu sighed, watching Ding Xiaoyan’s pitiful state.

Others were grim—what identity did Luo Tian have to dare humiliate Ding Xiaoyan in the city lord’s mansion?

“Boom…” Luo Tian withdrew his foot, ignoring Ding Xiaoyan on the ground. His foot struck Dong Xing’s arm again.

“Crack…” The sound of bones breaking made them all fear.

Dong Xing endured the pain, his eyes burning with hatred—this was his first time suffering such a severe injury and humiliation.

“Roar…” Dong Xing’s face showed fury, yelling to free his arm from Luo Tian’s foot—but he couldn’t move.

“You said you’d cut my arms—what now?” Luo Tian crouched, a demon-like figure gazing at Dong Xing.

Since arriving in the Eastern Region, he’d been cautious, chased like a stray dog in Beichang County. Afterward, Ding Xiaoyan had tormented him greatly.

After the North Region and Heavenly Corpse Sect incident, he’d decided not to quarrel with others. But these days, he realized some people and matters couldn’t be tolerated—only by terrifying them would they stop.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt like the unbeatable genius from the North Region again. His eyes flashed coldly at the other youths.

Their gazes met, and they lowered their heads, awe in their eyes—Luo Tian’s might had deeply shocked them.

“Strength always commands respect. After so long, I’d forgotten this truth!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, seeing their reverence.

Luo Tian’s foot rose again, crushing Dong Xing’s other hand—his resentment slightly eased.

His gaze fell on the Dragon Xuan Sword still clutched by Dong Xing, a smile on his face: “You really like this sword, huh?”

“What are you doing?” Dong Xing’s face showed fear as he saw Luo Tian eyeing his sword.

“I told you, you’ve wasted some of my things—so I’ll reclaim them from you!” Luo Tian smiled playfully, crouching to pry open Dong Xing’s fingers.

“Hum…” The Dragon Xuan Sword emitted a mournful sound, fear spreading into Luo Tian’s mind.

“Are you begging for mercy?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Dong Xing’s fiery eyes.

“Return it to me, or my father won’t let you live!” Dong Xing’s face showed madness, threatening.

“Threaten me? I’ve never feared threats!” Luo Tian sneered, tossing Dragon Xuan Sword to Dragon Baby.

The child saw the sword flying and his face saddened, his innocent gaze confused.

“You’ve stained our clan’s blood. I don’t know how you got dragon blood, but you insulted us—so you shouldn’t exist!” Dragon Baby spoke solemnly.

“Crack…” The Dragon Xuan Sword broke in Dragon Baby’s tiny hands, emitting a mournful sound.

“Monster!”

“What did I just see? A child no older than a few years broke an advanced-level sword!” The youths stared in disbelief at Dragon Baby and Luo Tian.

They felt this seemingly harmless child was more terrifying than the youth—this was an advanced-level Dragon Xuan Sword!

“Spit…” Dong Xing spat blood, the sword being his bone. Its breaking meant he lost a part of himself—more painful than losing hands, it wounded him fundamentally.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian’s face was grim as he watched Dragon Baby transform. His voice held coldness.

“You’re good—don’t worry, this child is part of my dragon clan. I won’t harm him; in fact, he’ll gain benefits. When the time comes, I’ll grant him a cultivation boon. But it depends on whether he survives the trials. As for who I am, that’s not important!” A calm voice echoed from Dragon Baby.

“Be careful—don’t provoke me, or I won’t let you live!” Luo Tian, upon breaking the sword, knew Dragon Baby’s true self wasn’t the child.

“Young man, don’t be so angry—relax. I won’t harm this child; otherwise, would his parents not detect my presence?” Another voice spoke from Dragon Baby.

Hearing this mention of the Dragon Sword couple, Luo Tian slightly relaxed—believed their power would detect such a presence. Since they hadn’t expelled it, there was no issue. Still, he remained cautious, eyes locked on Dragon Baby.

“Never mind—explaining to this child is useless. You’ll understand later. I’m leaving now; if it weren’t for this broken sword, I wouldn’t have emerged. You all take care—several strong people are coming!” The voice faded, and Dragon Baby’s eyes returned to innocence.

Chapter 328: Stalemate

“Big brother!” Dragon Baby, seeing Luo Tian’s cautious gaze, looked puzzled.
