“Crack…” In the next instant, the golden spear tip collided with the golden long sword body. Both bent slightly before Sun Yongyang and Luo Tian's figures flew backward simultaneously.

“This is more like it!” Luo Tian smiled, his gaze fixed on Sun Yongyang's aura piercing the heavens. He tightened his grip on the Shattered Heaven Spear and rushed forward again.

“Do you fear me?” Sun Yongyang saw Luo Tian charging, his heart brimming with joy. His current state couldn't last long; he feared Luo Tian wouldn't fight him directly, draining his strength and rendering his forbidden technique useless.

“Divine King's Seal!” Sun Yongyang held the Divine Emperor Sword in one hand and formed a seal with the other. A golden seal burst forth from his palm—one of the three divine techniques of the Divine Clan.

“Hum…” The golden seal pressed against the heavens, descending upon Luo Tian who had transformed into a streak of light.

“Jie Tian Seal!” Luo Tian sneered, launching another golden seal. The two golden seals collided above the heads of Sun Yongyang and Luo Tian.

At the same time, their figures crossed again. They both retreated, but this time Luo Tian only took a few steps back while Sun Yongyang was sent flying again, his face dark with anger.

“Damn it!” Sun Yongyang's expression twisted. He hadn't expected his forbidden technique to still be outmatched by Luo Tian.

“How can he be so strong!” Sun Yongyang's heart roared with fury, his blood burning faster as he rushed forward.

“Sacrificial Sword!” Sun Yongyang's voice echoed madly. His body gradually disintegrated in midair, merging into the Divine Emperor Sword.

The hum of energy resonated. Golden light surged. The entire world trembled with Sun Yongyang's strike.

“This is the secret technique created by the Epoch's Master of the Divine Clan. It can only be used once in a lifetime!” Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen's faces showed shock as they shouted to Luo Tian.

No need for their warning. Luo Tian's face had already turned serious, sensing the immense pressure from the golden divine sword approaching him. It was an instinctive life-or-death crisis—if he couldn't withstand it, he'd perish too.

Though the crimson battlefield allowed one death, Luo Tian didn't want to waste it on Sun Yongyang. After all, there was another trial ahead; who knew what awaited?

“Damn it, the immortal energy I just refined is about to be wasted again!” Luo Tian cursed, his recently refined immortal energy still warm. He immediately channeled it into the Shattered Heaven Spear.

Immortal might swept across, golden light radiated from the spear in Luo Tian's grip. The weapon exuded overwhelming power, its invisible pressure radiating outward.

“Run as far as you can!” Luo Tian shouted at Sun Mengru and the others before launching his weapon with immense power.

Two golden streaks, seemingly slow, collided in the eyes of those watching.

“Crack…” The crimson sky exploded again. The ground beneath them trembled violently.

“Run! Run!” Those who had previously taken the trial shouted, sprinting in all directions. They feared being caught in the collision's aftermath. Though they could survive once, surviving twice was impossible.

As figures fled, two streaks collided. Invisible waves spread outward.

In an instant, divine light illuminated the crimson sky, blinding everyone's eyes with its intensity.

Chapter 1720: Tears of the Lord ()

The power swept across, and after their collision, the crimson battlefield was again engulfed by a powerful surge—stronger than before when Sun Yongyang and others had activated epoch relics against the remnants.

“Good thing we ran fast!” Zheng Xin and others stood in the immortal tide, watching the immense power annihilate the world. Their eyes showed admiration.

“That Sun Yongyang was too determined. He didn't need to fight so hard! After all, he could die once anyway. Now it's uncertain if he'll survive!” Xu Liyi frowned, watching the chaos outside where no one could be found.

“You don't understand. We're all proud. Sun Yongyang suffered multiple defeats at Luo Tian's hands. If he failed this time, his cultivation heart would be shattered. From now on, it would hinder his future cultivation and make attaining enlightenment impossible!” Zhu Ge Tian sighed, speaking softly.

“Still don’t get it,” Xu Liyi and others shook their heads, confused by Zhu Ge Tian's words.

“Our paths differ. As disciples and children of the Epoch Masters, we were born with an invincible mark. Imagine a naturally invincible powerhouse finally being trampled underfoot—what's that feeling like!” Run Hongyu shook his head gently. Though he disliked conflict, he still yearned to attain enlightenment and follow in his father's footsteps.

“You really are bored,” Gu Lei frowned but secretly admired the pride of these Epoch Masters' children.

The chaos faded. The immortal tide's surroundings formed a vacuum again. Several thousand feet away, Luo Tian panted heavily before gazing at the battlefield's direction where they had fought. The Shattered Heaven Spear slowly returned to his front, its golden body dimmed.

“Where are they?” But then Luo Tian noticed Sun Yongyang, Nan Gong Wu Bei, and Fu Tu's absence. The view was empty.

A token emitting faint light lay calmly on the slowly healing crimson ground.

“Star River Token!” Du Hongxi and others saw the token resembling starlight, their faces lighting up. After two battles, there were over 200 tokens on the ground—enough for two to qualify for Star River Sect's inner disciple trial.

However, Du Hongxi, Guan Yuxin, and Ma Xiuzhen didn't dare to act rashly. Though most tokens were from their battle, they hesitated to collect them without Diao Dezhu's word.

“Did they escape?” Those standing in the immortal tide, including Diao Dezhu, showed confusion. They didn't know if Nan Gong Wu Bei had fled.

“Those tokens!” Soon, everyone noticed the tokens on the ground, their eyes flashing with light.

“Master, these tokens…” Guan Yuxin addressed Diao Dezhu, his voice carrying a questioning tone.

“Ha! I seem to have arrived too late!” Before Diao Dezhu could respond, a loud laugh echoed in their ears. A youth clad in martial attire appeared in Luo Tian's group's view.

“Such an exhilarating battle!” Before the youth's words finished, a soft laugh echoed. A white-cloaked youth walked from another direction.

“Enemy!” Seeing the two, Luo Tian's mind darkened. He sensed a threat from both.

Yet the two seemed to ignore Luo Tian’s group, striding confidently toward where they had fought. They picked up the Star River Tokens on the ground.

“Die!” Seeing their actions, Du Hongxi and others who had taken the trial turned dark. Those tokens were earned with their lives; now two youths ignored them and took them directly. How could they tolerate it?

“Damn, you're really overstepping!” Muttered curses arose. Those who had taken the trial glared at the two youths with anger.

“Who are they?” Luo Tian's face darkened as he looked at the two youths who hadn’t regarded them.

“Master hasn't even acted yet. You dare to move first? You're seeking death!” Du Hongxi roared, his body recovering some strength. He transformed into a green flash and rushed toward the martial-clad youth.

As he ran, green poison gas clung to Du Hongxi's palm. He reached the youth in an instant and slapped him.

“Hm!” The youth had just picked up a Star River Token when Du Hongxi's figure appeared before him. The youth’s face slightly hardened, standing straight. His palm radiated waves and returned the slap.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed. The two palms collided, making Du Hongxi’s face show joy.

“Poison…” As their palms touched, green poison gas transformed into a long green snake wrapping around the martial-clad youth's arm.

The next moment, people gasped. After colliding with the youth, Du Hongxi's body suddenly flew backward, his eyes filled with disbelief. He stopped after flying dozens of feet.

“How is this possible!” Everyone's faces showed shock, surprised the youth had sent Du Hongxi flying.

“Du Hongxi suffered some injuries and his immortal energy was nearly exhausted, but he still has strength!” Guan Yuxin and Ma Xiuzhen's faces also darkened, watching the youth who had only taken a few steps back.

“This poison is really strong!” The youth lifted his arm, looking at the green gas coiling like a snake around it. He smiled slightly before suddenly clenching his fist.

“Boom…” The green poison gas, continuously eroding the youth's arm, exploded and scattered before him.

“This…” Du Hongxi couldn’t speak as his proud poison was effortlessly dispelled by the youth.

“Who are you!” Du Hongxi shouted, his aura rising again. Though he had been at a disadvantage briefly, he still wasn’t afraid of this youth.

“I’m Wang, called Wang Wang!” The youth softly spoke his name. But Luo Tian’s group felt even more confused, as they had never heard this name before.

“What kind of name is Wang Wang… I feel like it's barking like a dog…” The people in the immortal tide mocked, despite the pressure the youth had given them. They weren’t tense but ridiculed the youth's name.

“I’ll try another one!” Guan Yuxin refused to believe, his hands moving. Clouds of darkness spread across the sky. Golden blades rained down like rain, sweeping toward the white-cloaked youth.

“This Star River Token I claim!” The white-cloaked youth looked at the descending blades. His eyes narrowed slightly, radiating divine light. He punched forward.

A golden vortex rose from the youth's fist. Next, his head seemed to twist, and those blades appeared disturbed, gathering toward the golden vortex.

Seeing the blades collected together, the youth laughed and struck another palm against them.

“Jie Tian Palm!” Seeing the youth's move, Sun Kemin’s face changed. His eyes showed disbelief.

“How could he use Jie Tian Palm! And I feel it's even better than how I do it!” Sun Kemin spoke in shock, making everyone’s faces show confusion.

Jie Tian Three Techniques—this was the martial art of the second Epoch Master of Humanity, Jie Tian. Back then, Luo Tian, Sun Kemin, and Tu Feiyang had competed for Jie Tian Master's mark. Luo Tian learned the strongest Jie Tian Seal, while Sun Kemin and Tu Feiyang each mastered Jie Tian Palm and Jie Tian Fist.

“Among the current world, besides us three, only Jie Tian Master's child could still use this technique!” Luo Tian felt a storm in his heart, gazing at the white-cloaked youth. He thought the youth might have a terrifying identity.

“Jun Wulei!” Luo Tian whispered, recalling the name in the mark when he obtained Jie Tian Master's inheritance.

“He… He is Jie Tian Master’s son!” In the immortal tide, Sun Kemin's face changed. He pointed at the white-cloaked youth and shouted loudly, recalling his identity.

“Jie… Jie Tian Master!” Hearing Sun Kemin's shout, everyone in the immortal tide showed shock, gazing at the white-cloaked youth.

Jie Tian Master, the second great power of Humanity. He was crucial to Humanity's success. The only one who could rival him was Duan Tian Master, who had led Humanity to break free from the ancient tribes. Both were titans who pushed back eons.

“Who is that person? He must have a big background to come with Jie Tian Master's child!” People then looked at the martial-clad youth.

“Ah, I was finally recognized!” The white-cloaked youth softly spoke, sighing long. He looked at Wang Wang who came with him, his eyes flashing a hint of battle.

At the same time, the youth who called himself Wang Wang looked at Jun Wulei. His eyes also showed a hint of surprise. Since awakening, he had heard the most about the nine regions' Epoch Masters.

“Unexpectedly, after my father, another great power appeared. And he's alive in the same era as his descendant!” Wang Wang’s face showed admiration, locking eyes with Jun Wulei.

“What did he say?” Hearing Wang Wang’s words, people from the nine regions were completely confused.

“After my father… that means his father is even older than Jie Tian Master!” Zheng Xin trembled, looking at the youth who called himself Zhang Letian.

Chapter 1721: Action ()

“Only one person is older than Jie Tian Master among Humanity's Epoch Masters!” Luo Tian and others murmured, their eyes showing shock at the youth named Wang Wang. Even Jun Wulei's gaze toward Wang Wang had changed to disbelief.

“Humanity’s first Epoch Master, Wang Duan Tian's son!” People recalled the supreme name of Humanity. He had led Humanity to break free from the ancient tribes' oppression, leading Humanity's rise.

“Duan Tian Master, Jie Tian Master’s child!” Luo Tian and others' gazes toward Wang Wang and Jun Wulei changed.

Without Duan Tian Master and Jie Tian Master, there would be no Humanity today. Thus, Wang Wang and Jun Wulei were two of the most powerful descendants in Humanity.

“Alright, I’m not standing under my father’s halo to grow. So I still want to fight for these Star River Tokens!” Wang Wang's face showed battle intent, gazing at Jun Wulei and Luo Tian.

“What a nonsense Epoch Master! They're just Heaven-Path level warriors. In the immortal realm, they have some status but aren't great powers!” Du Hongxi's face showed coldness, gazing at Wang Wang and Jun Wulei.

The immortal realm had no shortage of Heaven-Path level warriors. At this moment, these people had fully realized that the two were from the three thousand small worlds, not the immortal realm. Duan Tian Master's name was renowned in the nine regions but wasn't enough to impress these people. A son of a Heaven-Path level warrior wanted to dominate over them? Not a chance.

“Please, Master, allow us to compete for the Star River Tokens!” Guan Yuxin shouted, gazing at Diao Dezhu.

“This…” Hearing Guan Yuxin's words, Diao Dezhu was hesitant. He looked at Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan.

Seeing Diao Dezhu looking at him, Luo Tian's brows furrowed. After all, the number of Star River Tokens was limited. There were less than three hundred left among those present, plus over two hundred on the ground—totaling about six hundred. If these two took two hundred, it would be very tight for the rest.

“Being descendants of Humanity's most powerful two, we can allow you to take one hundred Star River Tokens. But it’s because of Duan Tian Master and Jie Tian Master, only this once!” After hearing Luo Tian's mental message, Diao Dezhu sighed long and gazed at Wang Wang and Jun Wulei.

“This…” Hearing Diao Dezhu's words, Du Hongxi and others who had taken the trial were furious. They had fought with their lives for these tokens, but now they were given to two unrelated people. This was unacceptable.

“No need!” Before Du Hongxi and others could protest, Wang Wang and Jun Wulei shook their heads. Their faces showed arrogance as they waved their hands, lifting the tokens from the ground. They gazed at Luo Tian and Du Hongxi.

Tokens appeared before them, and they spoke to Luo Tian and Du Hongxi: “You can also fight for it. The condition is defeating me!”

“Arrogant!” Hearing their words, Du Hongxi's group’s faces darkened. But they were also delighted. Unexpectedly, these two had such arrogance that even Diao Dezhu's words were disregarded.

“Since you insist, then it’s fine!” Diao Dezhu heard their words and felt anger. He hadn’t expected these two to be so ungrateful.

“I’ll fight you!” Guan Yu Jian, Du Hongxi, and Ma Xiuzhen heard Diao Dezhu's words. They had been angry for a long time and rushed toward Wang Wang and Jun Wulei.

“Hum…” As the three just moved, a brilliant light suddenly rose from the south of the crimson battlefield and soared into the crimson sky.

“What is that column of light? Has another immortal tide come?” Du Hongxi and others stopped, gazing at the column of light. Their faces showed joy but then disappointment as no immortal energy surged within it.

Columns of light rose from all directions of the crimson battlefield. If someone could see, beneath each column were complex altars.

“Haha, finally completed!” A youth in golden robes smiled, gazing at the column of light rising before him. His lips curled into a sly smile. His golden eyes showed an ageless沧桑.

“What's happening?” Everyone’s faces showed confusion, gazing at the eight columns of light rising. A sense of crisis grew in their hearts—a震慑 from the soul.

The hum echoed. As people were shocked, the eight golden columns suddenly changed color to gray. The crimson sky above them also twisted into a grey expanse, as if the entire world was coated in deathly ash.

After the crimson sky turned gray, a strong suction force suddenly rose from the grey sky and affected their bodies.

“Hm?” Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. This suction force didn’t affect his body but directly targeted his soul, vaguely trying to pull his spirit out of his body.

“Ah…” Luo Tian could feel it. How much more so for others? Some of the remnants at the peak of their cultivation trembled violently, beginning to struggle against the increasing suction.

“Why do I feel my soul is being pulled out?” A big man roared, trying to escape the terrifying suction.

Time passed slowly. The suction force grew stronger. Even Jun Wulei and Wang Wang felt uncomfortable, their eyes showing seriousness as they stabilized their souls.

“Roar…” As people became slightly panicked, a low roar echoed beneath them. A series of grey spirits flickered and gradually gathered together.

“Ten… a hundred…” Spirits with no intelligence flew rapidly, filling the world. Each spirit radiated powerful waves, making Luo Tian's group’s minds slightly tense.

“Soul-Annihilation Array!” Luo Tian's face showed seriousness, gazing at the spirits filling the world. He spoke softly.

“Ah…” As Luo Tian muttered, a scream echoed in his group's ears, drawing their attention.

The big man who had shouted before was convulsing violently. His grey soul face showed fear, slowly drifting out of his body.

But the big man was just the beginning. Others also started to do the same, their bodies trembling and souls drifting out of their bodies—though at different speeds.

“Appeared?” Luo Tian's eyes showed coldness. He had finally understood who this method belonged to and moved his hands.

“What is he doing?” Wang Wang, Jun Wulei, and Du Hongxi's faces showed confusion. They looked at Luo Tian whose aura was blazing. At this moment, they felt Luo Tian's complexity. They themselves were unstable in their souls, but Luo Tian looked unaffected.

“Soul-Annihilation!” Luo Tian roared and pressed his hands into the air. Invisible waves spread from him, radiating outward. Soon they enveloped everyone.

It wasn’t that Luo Tian was particularly kind; it was just that he felt the person secretly acting was dangerous. Saving one more person meant having one more strength.

“Hum…” As the waves spread, people whose souls had drifted out stopped. They slowly retracted back.

“Huff…” People who had their souls restored took deep breaths, their hearts still trembling. They looked at Luo Tian with gratitude.

“Enter the immortal tide. Don’t leave me within a thousand feet, or there will be another risk of soul extraction!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He looked at the increasing number of spirits, his eyes serious. Then he rushed toward the only light in the world.

“Go!” With Luo Tian leading, people now knew that perhaps Luo Tian had a way to solve the situation.

A group followed Luo Tian, rushing toward the immortal tide. Even Wang Wang and Jun Wulei did so because they felt strong pressure from those spirits. Though one or two could be killed, the many were enough to threaten them.

“Stop!” A cold voice echoed. The soulless spirits paused slightly before roaring and rushing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Get lost!” As he ran, Luo Tian roared. The unique pressure of souls spread from him, making the spirits show fear and stop attacking Luo Tian’s group.

“Kid, do you think you can turn it around?” The golden-robed youth smiled, standing on the altar. He pointed his finger, and a drop of blood flowed from it, falling onto the altar.

“Hum…” The hum echoed. Then a wave spread through the column of light reaching into the grey sky.

“Roar…” The spirits that Luo Tian had intimidated suddenly became frenzied again, as if they hadn’t felt Luo Tian’s intimidation. They rushed toward Luo Tian's group.

“Ah…” A scream echoed next, and the last two in Luo Tian’s group were directly rushed into their bodies. Their eyes immediately went blank.

Chapter 1722: Appearance ()

“Damn it!” Luo Tian's face darkened. He hadn’t expected the opponent to have such a method, even breaking his pressure.

But Luo Tian had no choice. At this moment, he could only try to save as many as possible. He couldn’t protect everyone.

As he ran, Luo Tian moved his hands. A grey soul knife hovered above his head and slashed toward the spirits rushing towards them.

Power swept across. Spirits were annihilated by Luo Tian's grey soul knife, and a path appeared before him.

“Go…” Luo Tian shouted at the group. His figure moved again, rushing toward the immortal tide. At this point, they were only a thousand feet away from the immortal tide, but that thousand feet was filled with spirits.

“Why so many spirits? And even Luo Tian can’t handle them!” Zheng Xin's group showed confusion, watching Luo Tian’s group moving through the spirits.

“Also these spirits are strong. I guess they were extracted by someone else using special means from the souls of those who died in this crimson battlefield!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian’s group fighting with the spirits.

Though it was only a thousand feet, it was filled with spirits. The entire world seemed to become an ocean of spirits. Only the immortal tide remained a sanctuary.

Luo Tian led the way, continuously slicing with his soul knife. Countless spirits were annihilated before him. Others also used their methods to fight the spirits, but their effectiveness was much lower than Luo Tian’s. The group moved forward with difficulty.

“Master, fight! Once you do, these spirits will vanish!” Ma Xiuzhen shouted repeatedly. His fists filled with grey gas struck constantly, following Luo Tian closely while shouting at Diao Dezhu in the immortal tide.

“Yes! A Heaven-Path level powerhouse can annihilate these spirits with a single gesture!” Du Hongxi and others also fought while looking expectantly at Diao Dezhu in the immortal tide.

“This…” Diao Dezhu's face showed embarrassment. He wanted to fight, but he knew his abilities. Once he stepped out, he would be devoured by the strong spirits within an hour.

“I can’t fight for now. Please hold on a little longer!” Diao Dezhu said with embarrassment, addressing Du Hongxi and others.

“Diao Dezhu, even now you’re still showing off!” Before Diao Dezhu’s words finished, a cold laugh echoed behind Luo Tian's group. Three figures rushed out of the surging spirits, their faces showing excitement.

“Those are them!” Hearing the voice, Luo Tian's mind slightly darkened. He felt three powerful auras approaching their direction at a terrifying speed.

“Ha! Luo Tian, didn’t expect us to have such a backup plan. Today, none of you will escape!” The loud laugh echoed in Luo Tian's ears. Soon after, they reached behind Luo Tian’s group.

They weren’t others; they were Fu Tu, Nan Gong Wu Bei, and the robed youth who had disappeared after Luo Tian and Sun Yongyang fought.

“They aren’t affected by these spirits!” Du Hongxi’s group was shocked, watching Fu Tu and the others arrive behind them in an instant.

“Idiots! That Diao Dezhu bastard has no strength. You still believe he’s a Heaven-Path level powerhouse? Come on, let him annihilate us!” Nan Gong Wu Bei roared, gazing at Du Hongxi’s group struggling forward.

“If it weren’t for you idiots, we wouldn’t have suffered heavy losses. So all of you should die!” Fu Tu growled, his hands flashing with light. He grabbed a green hand through the spirits and caught one of the remaining peak-era remnants, pulling him to his front with a sinister face.

“Boom…” That peak-era remnant was turned into blood mist in Fu Tu’s hands and annihilated.

“Kill…” Nan Gong Wu Bei and the robed youth also rushed forward, attacking Luo Tian’s group to massacre the remaining remnants.

Screams echoed again. One by one, those who had taken the trial fell under Fu Tu’s group. Fu Tu's face showed madness and joy, quickly reaching Luo Tian’s group.

“Luo Tian, dare to fight back!” Fu Tu roared, his body covered in blood but shouting at Luo Tian.

“Yes! That Jie Tian Master’s son and that Duan Tian Master’s son, come on. Don’t tarnish your father's reputation!” Nan Gong Wu Bei laughed wildly, watching Luo Tian’s group move faster than others.

At this moment, Luo Tian's group was only about a thousand feet away from the immortal tide. However, those who had taken the trial were reduced to less than fifty due to Fu Tu’s massacre and the spirits’ consumption.

“Ah…” Du Hongxi, Guan Yuxin, and Ma Xiuzhen’s hearts were furious. They finally understood that Diao Dezhu was faking it. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have stayed idle while Luo Tian faced danger.

They were so upset they wanted to vomit. If they had known Diao Dezhu was faking it from the start, they wouldn’t have been so helpless. With so many of them, they could have wiped out Diao Dezhu and Nan Gong Wu Bei’s groups. But in the end, they were used as pawns and gained nothing.

“We should go help Luo Tian!” Cold Qiu Chan’s face showed worry, speaking to the group.

“I’ll go!” Long Jie saw Fu Tu approaching Luo Tian and his group. His eyes showed anxiety. Yao Chen held a long stick, his eyes glowing with golden light, also showing intent.

“No need!” But just as the group was about to move, Luo Tian's voice echoed in their ears.

“Dare to fight back with me!” Luo Tian slashed, annihilating many spirits. He spoke to Jun Wulei and Wang Wang.

“Ha! I’ve wanted this for a long time!” Wang Wang laughed, then stopped his movement. His aura was overwhelming.

“Happily so!” Jun Wulei’s face also showed a cold glint. Fu Tu's group had insulted their fathers, which they couldn’t tolerate.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded. He also stood still. Du Hongxi’s group had no choice but to stay there, as they couldn’t leave Luo Tian's thousand feet. If they moved away, they would be pulled by that force.

“Ha! Dare to stop!” As the group stopped, Fu Tu’s group also reached Luo Tian's front. They looked at Luo Tian’s group still resisting the spirits, their eyes showing joy.

“Good!” Luo Tian looked at Fu Tu and Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group, who were less than a hundred feet away. His face showed coldness.

“Fen Tian Fire Array!” Luo Tian's voice was cold, his hands moving. A series of seven-color fire dragons flew from his hands. The extreme temperature swept over everyone's head.

“Roar…” Fire dragons roared, annihilating many spirits instantly. This eased Du Hongxi’s group's pressure.

“Boom…” Luo Tian grabbed the air with his hands. The fire dragons turned into a vast sea of fire, filling the world and forming a flame barrier that enveloped everyone.

“This seems to have less trouble!” Wang Wang and Jun Wulei stood under the seven-color flame barrier, gazing at Fu Tu’s group with cold faces.

“This…” Fu Tu's group looked at the seven-color barrier, which blocked the spirits outside. Though many spirits still rushed toward Luo Tian’s group, they were like moths flying into fire, annihilated by the seven-color flames.

They were stunned. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have this move, and a bad feeling arose in their hearts.

“We’re coming back for a fight!” Luo Tian’s face showed coldness. He moved quickly, shouting at the group.

“This barrier can last about an hour. Eliminate these three within that time!” Luo Tian's voice echoed, making everyone’s hearts slightly tense. They looked at the barrier above them. Though powerful, it gradually weakened as more spirits collided with it.

“Kid, you spoke so confidently earlier!” Wang Wang’s face showed coldness. His figure moved like a ghost, instantly appearing before Fu Tu and striking down.

His strike carried powerful energy. Fu Tu's face immediately darkened, his teeth gritting as he punched toward Wang Wang’s hand.

“Boom…” Fu Tu's body was sent flying instantly, his face showing disbelief.

“Kill! Damn it, but now we’re at this point. There’s no room to retreat!” Du Hongxi and others’ faces also showed madness, rushing toward Fu Tu’s group. They knew now that they were temporarily allied with Luo Tian.

If they turned on each other, they would be in a desperate situation in this battlefield filled with spirits.

Though only fifty people had survived the trial, each of these fifty was a strong individual. Though not as powerful as Du Hongxi, some had reached the level of near-epoch masters. Each would be a great power in the nine regions.

Fifty people, filled with anger, attacked Fu Tu’s group. They vented their resentment on the three.

Fu Tu's group faced so many people, and the result was predictable. Fu Tu’s group was completely doomed.

Chapter 1723: Sun Miechen Appears ()

Numerous powerful martial arts struck Fu Tu’s group. Luo Tian, Jun Wulei, and Wang Wang's hands also radiated waves as they joined Du Hongxi’s group in attacking.
