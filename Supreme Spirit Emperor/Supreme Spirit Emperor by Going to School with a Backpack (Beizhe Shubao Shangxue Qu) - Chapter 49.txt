Luo Tian extended his hand, and a radiant golden tower appeared in his palm. The surrounding people marveled at it with envy. Chen Changsheng's face bore an enigmatic expression as he gazed upon the Nascent Soul Tower but said nothing further.

"Everyone, prepare yourselves. I shall lead you out," Chen Changsheng spoke softly to the group.

"What about Tu Yuenzheng and his companions?" A black-cloaked figure behind Leng Qiuchan inquired softly.

"No problem. This domain now answers to me!" Chen Changsheng's face bore a self-assured smile as he spoke.

As his words faded, Chen Changsheng's fingers danced again, summoning a formidable force around him. His gaze swept toward the distant figures of Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran, who now appeared within his perception.

At that moment, Tu Yuenzheng and his group rested atop a small hill, their faces ashen with no trace of color.

While they rested, a repulsive force from space enveloped them, forcibly ejecting them from the domain.

"They've left. If there's no issue, we should go as well," Chen Changsheng asked the group again.

The group exchanged glances with the Tiger Clan members, their faces marked by reluctance. "Senior Brother Changsheng, please treat these Tiger Clan people kindly! If possible, let them glimpse the outside world!" they murmured.

"Rest assured, Senior Brother Luo. I shall certainly not let them remain here. Once we exit, I'll arrange for them to enter the Water Source Monastery. Those with talent will be taught cultivation," Chen Changsheng vowed.

"Indeed. Then, let's go."

Luo Tian spoke, casting a glance at the domain space.

Hearing Luo Tian's words and finding no objections from others, Chen Changsheng smiled faintly. His fingers danced repeatedly, forming a gentle force around everyone's bodies, sending them out of the domain space.

"Father, can we see the divine elder brother and sister again?" A small boy in Hu Xiucheng's arms asked softly, watching the disappearing figures of Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan.

"Sure will," Hu Xiucheng seemed to speak to his son, yet it was more like a self-muttering.

A resonant spatial force erupted. Luo Tian's group stood steadily on the ground.

Feeling the dense surrounding qi, several people displayed expressions of awe. "We're out!" they exclaimed.

"Three and a half months?" None had expected to have spent so long within the domain space.

Chen Changsheng retrieved two storage bags from his sleeve, offering them to Luo Tian and Feng Tianxiong. "This journey owes much to your assistance; otherwise, I wouldn't have succeeded so smoothly. This is the three thousand yuan qi stones we agreed upon and some treasures from the domain—none missing!"

"I don't need it. Acquiring the Nascent Soul Tower and so many yuan qi stones has already made this journey worthwhile. Besides, there are still those debts!" Luo Tian smiled and declined Chen Changsheng's offerings.

How could Luo Tian not know that this Nascent Soul Tower was left for his sect's disciples by the Water Source Monastery? In the eyes of the monastery's great elders, the one who obtained the Zhen Tian Jian would naturally reclaim this Nascent Soul Tower. After all, seizing the Zhen Tian Jian made one nearly invincible within it.

Yet Chen Changsheng never mentioned the Nascent Soul Tower, a gesture that deeply moved Luo Tian. How could he accept anything else?

"Please don't be polite. Take it!" Chen Changsheng's face bore solemnity as he spoke.

"You take it. Thank you for helping me before. It wouldn't be right to come all this way without returning the favor!" Luo Tian, seeing no other choice, turned and offered the storage bag to Leng Qiuchan.

"This is all? You think so little of me?" Leng Qiuchan's eyes held disdain. "Do you know what Tu Yuenzheng offered me?"

"What?" Luo Tian inquired, as did Chen Changsheng, curious about what his elder brother had offered Leng Qiuchan. He sensed their identities were indeed extraordinary.

"One million yuan qi stones, the treasures within, and ten Yellow-ranked weapons or armor!" Leng Qiuchan declared, leaving Luo Tian's group stunned.

Chen Changsheng's face also bore astonishment. He sighed inwardly, thinking his elder brother was truly relentless.

"Take it. That's all. Take it or not!" Luo Tian pursed his lips, attempting to reclaim the storage bag.

"Take it! Why not? If you don't, won't this be a wasted trip?" Leng Qiuchan's eyes held a glint of amusement as he snatched the storage bag.

"Changsheng, you succeeded? Where are Yuenzheng and them?" The voice of the Water Source Monastery's Grand Elder echoed into their ears. Now that the cave was gone, the entire mountain had been absorbed into the Zhen Tian Jian by Chen Changsheng.

"They should emerge shortly," Chen Changsheng smiled faintly.

As Chen Changsheng's words faded, spatial fluctuations resounded again. Several figures fell one after another from the sky, landing on the ground with a dull thud.

"They've emerged!" Chen Changsheng smiled at Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran's disheveled forms.

Tu Yuenzheng's group, thrown into confusion, had just risen when they saw the Grand Elder and Chen Changsheng's smiling face.

Chapter 237: Parting

"Chen Changsheng!" Tu Yuenzheng and his group shouted, their voices filled with resentment.

They naturally knew that their current disheveled state was due to Chen Changsheng. However, sensing his formidable strength had increased significantly compared to before, they could only let out a low growl and fell silent.

"Since everyone has emerged, we should return to the sect. These three months outside have seen many events; the world is quite unstable now," the Grand Elder said, seeing all Water Source Monastery disciples unharmed. Though Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran looked exhausted, they bore no fatal injuries.

"Grand Elder, wait!" Tu Yuenzheng spoke coldly, gazing at Luo Tian with a hint of malice.

"This Luo Tian attempted to kill me and Pang Shidi multiple times within the Nascent Soul Tower, seizing it. I hope the Grand Elder will uphold justice for us!" Tu Yuenzheng spoke loudly.

"Yes, Grand Elder. Fortunately, this Luo Tian seized the Nascent Soul Tower, which is why he spared our lives. Otherwise, my elder brother and I might not have made it out!" Pang Haoran, hearing Tu Yuenzheng's words, shifted his gaze as if a child who had been bullied returning home to complain to his parents.

"Is that true?" The Grand Elder's face darkened as he looked at the two, his gaze sweeping toward Luo Tian with unmistakable hostility.

"Grand Elder, it's not as you think. If Luo Tian truly intended to kill them both, they wouldn't be alive now," Chen Changsheng spoke solemnly, explaining. He hadn't expected Tu Yuenzheng to be so shameless.

"Shameless! Today I've seen the Water Source Monastery!" Leng Qiuchan spoke softly, his gaze filled with disdain toward the Grand Elder.

"Indeed, no one could!" Feng Tianxiong spoke little but his contemptuous gaze made Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran flush.

"Hand over the Nascent Soul Tower, and you may leave. This Nascent Soul Tower is not something for you to take!" The Grand Elder's face darkened. He hadn't expected Chen Changsheng to have taken the Zhen Tian Jian without taking the Nascent Soul Tower.

This domain space and the Nascent Soul Tower were originally prepared by the Water Source Monastery for its next inheritor. How could they allow it to be taken by another? An Earth-ranked treasure, something even he coveted.

Hearing the Grand Elder's words, Chen Changsheng's face changed. He stood before Luo Tian, understanding the Grand Elder's meaning clearly. He spoke softly to him: "Grand Elder, since this Nascent Soul Tower was prepared for me, the right to command it should belong to me. Today, I publicly declare that I gift this Nascent Soul Tower to Luo Tian!"

"What?" The Grand Elder's aura suddenly shifted, pressing toward Chen Changsheng.

Chen Changsheng remained undaunted, his gaze resolute as he faced the Grand Elder's overwhelming power. His body stood like a mighty tree, unmoving.

"Good, good, good! Changsheng, you truly... don't regret it!" The Grand Elder's face bore anger as he gazed at Chen Changsheng, yet his eyes also held a flicker of disappointment.

Luo Tian could not bear it. Clearly, if Chen Changsheng returned to the sect, he would face punishment. Luo Tian could not bear being the reason for others' suffering.

His heart stirred, and a radiant golden tower appeared in his palm. He offered it to Chen Changsheng, speaking softly: "Senior Brother Changsheng, take back the Nascent Soul Tower. I cannot let my reason cause you to be implicated upon returning to the sect!"

"Whew!" A gasp of surprise echoed from everyone's mouths, stunned by Luo Tian's words.

Even Leng Qiuchan, who had always remained composed, was surprised by Luo Tian's actions.

An Earth-ranked treasure! To simply return it as if it were insignificant. Moreover, the owner had already promised to give it to him. And Luo Tian's acquisition of this Nascent Soul Tower was only possible because of Leng Qiuchan. Otherwise, he wouldn't be alive now.

The Grand Elder gazed at Luo Tian with an expression of disbelief. Having weathered many storms, he could clearly see that Luo Tian's eyes held no other intent but to return the Nascent Soul Tower to Chen Changsheng.

"Roar..."

A tiger's roar echoed in everyone's ears.

A white lightning bolt appeared beside Luo Tian. The white tiger's face bore a hint of confusion.

"Sorry, Tiger Brother, this tower won't fit you! I'll find another place for it!" Luo Tian apologized to the white tiger, his face filled with regret.

"Roar..." The white tiger cautiously glanced around before spotting the Grand Elder. Its face bore a flicker of fear, as its beastly senses were stronger than humans', immediately sensing the Grand Elder's terrifying Bone-Devouring Peak aura.

The white tiger dared not act recklessly. It lowered its head and approached Luo Tian.

This white tiger was the Tiger Clan's beast, accompanying Luo Tian on his journey through the Tianyuan Continent. It had no desire to remain confined within the Tiger Clan.

Luo Tian regretted not having asked Long Jian to send him a powerful beast when he left the Great An Forest. Now, this white tiger had come to him willingly—though it was at the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage, Luo Tian was confident that with his elixirs, he could elevate it to the Bone-Devouring Peak or even Soul Essence.

After releasing the white tiger, Luo Tian hesitated not a moment. He severed his connection to the Nascent Soul Tower and hurled it into the sky. Instantly, the tower radiated golden light again, growing larger and larger in people's eyes.

"Crash..." A dull sound echoed. The Nascent Soul Tower returned to its massive form, more sacred due to the presence of external qi.

"Senior Brother Changsheng, go claim it!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed Chen Changsheng.

"Luo Tian, if you consider me a friend, don't say such things. This Nascent Soul Tower was given to me; there's no way I can reclaim it," Chen Changsheng said solemnly.

"Rest assured. Though this Nascent Soul Tower is an Earth-ranked treasure, I feel it still falls short of my Zhen Hun Ding. A mere Nascent Soul Tower pales in comparison to the friendship between us!" Luo Tian spoke with disdain, comforting Chen Changsheng.

The surrounding disciples watched the two pushing and shoving each other. Their hearts ached: "Is this really an Earth-ranked treasure? Why do they treat it like common vegetables!"

"Enough. Go in and refine it. Don't linger here like a woman! The stronger your power, the more likely you'll need it in the future!" Luo Tian stopped Chen Changsheng from continuing and patted his shoulder, speaking sternly as if he would turn hostile.

Chapter 238: The Reappearance of the Tianshi Sect

Hearing Luo Tian's resolute words, Chen Changsheng's face bore a touch of gratitude. Knowing he couldn't refuse, he nodded heavily and strode into the Nascent Soul Tower.

Seeing Chen Changsheng enter the tower, everyone looked at Luo Tian with admiration. Few could relinquish an Earth-ranked treasure so casually. Even if they could, it was only those with numerous treasures and high cultivation who weren't reliant on them. Yet among the Cultivation Body Stage, they had never seen anyone as magnanimous as Luo Tian.

At that moment, the most regretful were Chai Xiangming and Jing Bolan. Their betrayal had cost them nothing, but clearly, they were now excluded from the treasures within this domain. Thinking of Luo Tian and Chen Changsheng's generosity, it was certain that Feng Tianxiong's storage bag contained much.

Zhuang Shengjie, Gu Zhengye, and Ying Hongtu were also郁闷. Compared to others, they had it worse—gaining nothing yet losing three drops of essence blood and those massive debts. However, with Pang Haoran's promise to repay them, they felt slightly better.

"Thank you, Grand Elder!" The Grand Elder's voice echoed, carrying a hint of guilt. He was obviously embarrassed for previously trying to force Luo Tian to hand over the Nascent Soul Tower.

"Grand Elder, what's this? Could you tell me what happened outside these three months? Why is it so unstable?" Luo Tian asked with a touch of confusion.

"Uh..." The Grand Elder's face was complex, his eyes filled with hesitation.

"What?" Luo Tian noticed the Grand Elder's complicated expression and felt a premonition of something bad.

"I advise everyone here to have your sect's elders come and fetch you. Many things have happened recently!" The Grand Elder spoke, gazing at each sect's prodigies.

"The situation is this: after you entered the Nascent Soul Tower for a month, cities in the Northern Region were repeatedly attacked. After investigation by various sects, it was determined that this was the Tianshi Sect's doing. Despite their full-scale crackdown, they only captured two groups of people. And these two groups were led by individuals at least at the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage!" The Grand Elder's face was grave as he spoke to everyone.

Hearing the Grand Elder's words, all including Luo Tian felt their expressions stiffen. Even Leng Qiuchan, who had always remained composed, bore a serious expression. Everyone was well aware of the Tianshi Sect as a major sect.

"In the captured Tianshi Sect prisoners, various sects' elders used soul-searching techniques. They discovered that this time's Tianshi Sect attack primarily targeted the Five Elements Sect!" The Grand Elder spoke again, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed. If the Grand Elder said this, he was indeed in danger.

"The Tianshi Sect has always been fond of various body types. They kill those with special bodies, cultivating them through specific methods. Clearly, your Five Elements Body's appearance is a great temptation for them!" The Grand Elder clearly knew Luo Tian was a Five Elements Body and could sense he was far stronger than an average Cultivation Body Stage nine.

At that moment, Ying Hongtu and others retrieved their jade talismans to contact their sects. They were all special body types. Though the Grand Elder said the Tianshi Sect's attack primarily targeted Luo Tian, it was clear that the entire Northern Region was unstable now.

Luo Tian also retrieved his jade talisman, intending to contact Zhang Ziping to inform him of his location. He couldn't risk being ambushed on the way back.

Meanwhile, the three black-cloaked figures behind Leng Qiuchan also bore serious expressions. They retrieved their jade talismans, about to contact their sects, but Leng Qiuchan stopped them.

"Miss, it's better to contact your sect. If we encounter the Tianshi Sect, we'll be in danger. Don't be reckless!" One of the black-cloaked figures spoke with urgency.

"Don't say that. Let me retreat because of the Tianshi Sect? That would be ridiculed! Besides, I snuck out secretly!" Leng Qiuchan coldly replied.

Hearing Leng Qiuchan's words, Luo Tian felt a flicker of confusion. He didn't know what sect Leng Qiuchan belonged to, but he was certain she wasn't from the Northern Region. To return to her sect through the Northern Region, the journey was long. On the way, they might encounter the Tianshi Sect, and the group could indeed be in danger.

As Luo Tian pondered, a gust of wind rose from everyone's ears. Several figures in blue robes appeared within their sight.

Seeing the figures, Ying Hongtu bore a hint of joy. The people were from his sect's elders. He hadn't expected the Thunderclap Sect to arrive so quickly.

As a Northern Region sect, they were faster than others. The figures flashed, arriving before the group in an instant.

"Xu Yuansheng! Long time no see!" The elder leading the group spoke loudly to the Water Source Monastery's Grand Elder.

"Lei Qingchuan, it's been years. How have you been?" The Grand Elder Xu Yuansheng smiled slightly, responding.

"Fine. Hongtu's kid didn't cause you any trouble, did he?" Lei Qingchuan's voice thundered as he looked at Ying Hongtu.

"Ying Hongtu pays respects to the Grand Elder!" Ying Hongtu bowed respectfully upon seeing the arrival.

"Huh?" Seeing Ying Hongtu's pale face, Lei Qingchuan furrowed his brows slightly.

"Someone forced him to burn essence blood? Disgraceful!" Lei Qingchuan's face bore anger, sensing Ying Hongtu's condition and scolding him loudly.

"This..." Ying Hongtu felt shame, his gaze resentfully glancing at Luo Tian.

"Was it him who injured you?" Lei Qingchuan asked softly.

"Yes, he's the Five Elements Sect's Luo Tian!" Ying Hongtu dared not hide and spoke softly, recounting his experience within the domain.

People listened curiously to Ying Hongtu's account. None knew what had happened inside the domain.

When people heard Luo Tian single-handedly defeating the魂祭 (Soul Sacrifice), their faces bore shock.

Even Grand Elder Xu Yuansheng and Lei Qingchuan glanced at Luo Tian with surprise. They hadn't expected this seemingly frail youth to unleash such formidable power.

"Ha, he's truly one of the top young talents. Hand over those three drops of essence blood, and I won't hold it against you. Otherwise, don't blame me for being unkind!" Lei Qingchuan's gaze bore pressure as he spoke to Luo Tian.

Chapter 239: Lu Kunpeng Arrives

"What? You couldn't fight, so you sent an old man to be shameless?" Leng Qiuchan sneered and stood before Luo Tian, her face devoid of fear as she gazed at Lei Qingchuan.

"Little one, who are you?" Lei Qingchuan asked softly after hearing Leng Qiuchan's scolding.

"You can't handle me!" The three black-cloaked figures behind Leng Qiuchan bore a hint of disdain, standing behind her.

"Hmph. You're too young and reckless! It seems your parents never taught you to address elders with respect. Today, I'll bring your elders here to teach you!" Lei Qingchuan's face bore a smile but his eyes held coldness. He felt slighted by these Cultivation Body Stage youths scolding him.

"You dare touch us?" Feng Tianxiong spoke coldly, standing before the group as well.

"Who are you?" Lei Qingchuan looked at the people before Luo Tian, surprised they dared to stand before him at the Bone-Devouring Peak.

Looking at these young figures, Lei Qingchuan's expression shifted. While the Thunderclap Sect might be able to withstand the Five Elements Sect, adding these two groups' backing made it impossible for the Thunderclap Sect to fight against their forces.

Those invited by the Water Source Monastery's young disciples were clearly not weak. At minimum, they matched the Thunderclap Sect. From the black-cloaked figures' words, it was clear they didn't respect the Water Source Monastery. Thus, there was only one possibility: their sect was stronger than the Thunderclap Sect.

"I won't let you touch him!" Grand Elder Xu Yuansheng stood before Luo Tian, speaking softly.

"Xu Yuansheng? Are you also going to block me?" Lei Qingchuan's face darkened, looking at Xu Yuansheng. He hadn't expected to be blocked by him. Though he had no desire to attack Luo Tian, being intimidated by these youths made it hard for him to maintain his dignity.

At that moment, Xu Yuansheng's arrival provided a way out. It was exactly what Lei Qingchuan wanted.

But fate had other plans. As Lei Qingchuan hesitated, a clear voice echoed: "I'll see how you can touch him today!"

Wind rustled. Another figure appeared within their sight. Hearing the voice, Luo Tian's face bore a touch of relief. He sighed inwardly, glad for the timely arrival. Under everyone's curious gaze, Lu Kunpeng appeared before them.

At the same time, Luo Tian felt a warm sense. Lu Kunpeng rarely involved himself in external matters. He hadn't expected it to be Lu Kunpeng coming to fetch him.

"Lei Qingchuan! You've lived long enough to end up on a dog's back!" Lu Kunpeng's face bore anger as he stood before Luo Tian.

"Lu Kunpeng!" Lei Qingchuan's face twitched upon seeing Lu Kunpeng. He naturally knew about the Dan Sect's Lu Kunpeng. They had once fought in their youth, but with Lu Kunpeng rarely appearing, they hadn't met often.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng's arrival, Lei Qingchuan's face turned serious. His previous confidence vanished.

"Lei Qingchuan, I heard you wanted to touch him? Come on, today try touching him!" Lu Kunpeng shouted loudly, his voice forming a massive pressure that pressed toward Lei Qingchuan.

Lei Qingchuan and Xu Yuansheng were stunned. Both could sense that although the three of them were at the Bone-Devouring Peak, Lu Kunpeng was slightly stronger than the two.

Lu Kunpeng had long cultivated elixirs and endured many thunderstorms. The lightning storms were the best training for Lu Kunpeng. His talent was also not poor. If he hadn't been obsessed with elixirs, he might have entered the Soul Essence Stage years ago. He was incomparable to the two.

Lei Qingchuan's face darkened, his eyes flickering with fear. What he feared most wasn't strength but the terrifying influence of a cultivator's elixir expertise. For years, his influence in the Northern Region surpassed even some sect masters. Their positions were worlds apart.

At the same time, Lei Qingchuan was shocked by Luo Tian's weight. To have a long-reclusive Lu Kunpeng come personally to fetch him, this Luo Tian must be treasured by the Five Elements Sect.

"Lu Xiong, listen to me!" Lei Qingchuan began to speak but was cut off.

"Go... If I find out who's shameless and unscrupulous enough to attack the Five Elements Sect's young generation, don't blame us for being unkind! No mercy!" Lu Kunpeng didn't even let him finish, waving his hand and speaking coldly.

Lei Qingchuan's face turned red. He was also shocked by Lu Kunpeng's harsh words, "no mercy." This was a sect's ultimatum when pushed to desperation.

But soon, Lei Qingchuan thought of the recent events. The Five Elements Sect's losses were among the greatest, with the Tianshi Sect rampant.

"We're leaving!" Lei Qingchuan knew he wouldn't gain anything here. His face darkened as he spoke to Ying Hongtu.

"Um... Elder, please wait a moment," Luo Tian spoke timidly, blocking Lei Qingchuan. He spoke softly.

"Who are you? Don't push too hard!" Lei Qingchuan, clearly angered by Lu Kunpeng's actions, saw this young man dare to block him. His face finally showed madness, ready for a fight.

"Grand Elder misunderstood! I have something to say about Hongtu's situation in the domain. He hasn't told you everything!" Luo Tian calmly approached Lei Qingchuan, clearly unafraid now that Lu Kunpeng supported him.

Seeing Luo Tian approach, Lei Qingchuan's face bore confusion. Ying Hongtu also felt confused before his expression suddenly changed, realizing what he hadn't said.

Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran's faces also darkened, clearly recalling what had happened in the domain.

"What is it? Speak quickly!" Lei Qingchuan, clearly annoyed by Luo Tian's actions, frowned at Ying Hongtu.

"It was like this. In the domain, Hongtu borrowed some yuan qi stones from me. Did you help settle it?" Luo Tian held out a pile of white paper with many people's handwriting.

Luo Tian flipped through them, searching for Ying Hongtu's debt note.

"Hmph. Ying Hongtu, you really are successful! You didn't bring yuan qi stones before leaving and still borrowed from others!" Lei Qingchuan's face bore anger as he looked at Ying Hongtu.

Chapter 240: They Also Owe Me Money

"Grand Elder, this..." Ying Hongtu's face was about to bleed. He didn't know what to say.

"Hmph! How much?" Lei Qingchuan impatiently took out a storage bag, speaking to Luo Tian.

"Not much. Not much. Just one million!" Luo Tian smiled and handed the debt note to Lei Qingchuan.

"Hmph. Just one... What?" Lei Qingchuan's face froze, his storage bag slipping from his hand and falling to the ground.

"Ha! Lei Qingchuan, the Thunderclap Sect truly is a major sect. Its disciples have started borrowing money outside! And it's one million!" Lu Kunpeng bore admiration, laughing loudly.

The Water Source Monastery disciples around also stared in disbelief at Ying Hongtu. How could he be so extravagant, owing such a large amount of yuan qi stones?

"What in the world did you buy!" Lei Qingchuan's voice thundered, unable to contain himself. He shouted.

"I... I bought some elixirs!" Ying Hongtu wished for a hole to dig and hide.

"Six-star elixirs? So expensive!" Lei Qingchuan's heart bled. One million yuan qi stones—this was no small sum for a Thunderclap Sect Grand Elder.

"Three-star elixirs. This three..."

"Enough!" Lei Qingchuan was furious beyond measure, not wanting to hear Ying Hongtu's explanation. He had already been scolded by Lu Kunpeng, which was enough to make him lose face. Now Ying Hongtu had spent one million yuan qi stones on mere three-star elixirs, and he couldn't stand to see Ying Hongtu anymore.

"Hand over your yuan qi stones!" Lei Qingchuan shouted at the two beside him.

"Yes!" They dared not defy the enraged Lei Qingchuan. They obediently took out their yuan qi stones from the storage bags.

One million yuan qi stones piled up like a mountain, glowing with radiant light that illuminated everyone's faces.

Everyone's expressions bore greed and envy as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled, collecting the yuan qi stones. He left ten of them and handed them to Lei Qingchuan, his face timid as he spoke: "I won't take these ten yuan qi stones. Let them be your travel expenses!"

"Go...!" Lei Qingchuan couldn't bear to stay any longer, especially seeing the Water Source Monastery disciples' glances. He was uncomfortable.

"Ah... Lei Qingchuan, your disciple outside inevitably encounters important matters. Be at ease. One million yuan qi stones are nothing," Xu Yuansheng spoke softly, trying to comfort.

Hearing Xu Yuansheng's words, Lei Qingchuan's face darkened. Though he knew Xu Yuansheng was comforting him, it felt like mockery.

He glared at Ying Hongtu and grabbed the weak Ying Hongtu. He led the other two away, moving with such speed that everyone marveled.

"Lei Qingchuan, remember what I said!" Lu Kunpeng called after Lei Qingchuan.

"Rest assured. The Thunderclap Sect knows the importance of priorities!" Lei Qingchuan spoke as he walked, his voice resolute. He naturally knew the most pressing matter was to eliminate the Tianshi Sect. After speaking, he led Ying Hongtu away swiftly.

The Water Source Monastery disciples watched the embarrassed Lei Qingchuan, whispering among themselves.

"This Ying Hongtu is really a peculiar person. He spent one million yuan qi stones on a pile of three-star elixirs. Second Elder, was it you who brought him? Next time don't bring such a fool!"

"Yes, Second Elder. Don't let this person lower your standards!"

The Water Source Monastery disciples spoke among themselves.

"Silence!" Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran both spoke, their eyes fixed on the people who had spoken.

Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran's faces turned red. They mentally cursed: "You fool, your whole family is a fool! I also gave Luo Tian a debt note, and it's more than Ying Hongtu. What am I then!"

But they only cursed mentally. Their faces were also grim, and the only ones with a better expression were Jing Bolan and Chai Xiangming. They bore regretful expressions, secretly thanking themselves for being on Luo Tian's team initially. Otherwise, they would have ended up in the same situation as these people.

As the group saw Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran's outburst, they didn't know why Tu Yuenzheng was so upset. However, they were wise enough to stay silent and respectfully watched Xu Yuansheng and Lu Kunpeng's conversation.

"Kunpeng, it's been years since we last met," Xu Yuansheng looked at the departing Lei Qingchuan, his face bearing a touch of nostalgia. They had met when they were in their forties or fifties, but now both had reached old age.

"Yes, Old Xu. I wonder how many of us will reach the Soul Essence Stage," Lu Kunpeng smiled, his gaze also filled with nostalgia.

"Soul Essence Stage! It's hard. Let fate decide. But I still favor you the most. Next is Old Master Xinyin of the Yin Sect. As for others, it's hard!" Xu Yuansheng smiled.

"Enough talk. I need to take this little brat back!" Lu Kunpeng's face bore anger as he smacked Luo Tian's head.

"This kid is quite good!" Xu Yuansheng smiled, looking at Luo Tian. His excellence was evident to all.

"What's good about him? He's a troublemaker!" Lu Kunpeng smacked Luo Tian's head again, but his eyes held pride.

Xu Yuansheng frowned. Seeing Lu Kunpeng's pride, he almost wanted to hit him.

"Enough talk. We really need to leave now. The world isn't peaceful, and I fear unexpected incidents. I'll take my leave first!" Lu Kunpeng bowed to Xu Yuansheng.

"Ah, be careful on the way," Xu Yuansheng's face turned serious. He didn't stop him.

"Go! Little brat, I'll deal with you when I get back!" He scolded Luo Tian.

"Um... Grand Elder, I have something else to say," Luo Tian spoke again, hesitating before the crowd.

"Don't mention debts. Don't mention debts!" Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran mentally prayed, their faces tense.

Lu Kunpeng's brows furrowed slightly as he looked at Luo Tian, waiting for his next words. Xu Yuansheng was also curious about what Luo Tian had to say.

But soon, Xu Yuansheng became even more curious. Because Luo Tian was heading toward him.

"What's it?" Xu Yuansheng, who had a good impression of Luo Tian, smiled slightly and spoke softly.

"It's just embarrassing to say. But since the Grand Elder also said that disciples outside inevitably encounter matters, um... Senior Brother Tu and Senior Brother Pang seem to owe me money too!" Luo Tian's face bore a timid smile as he spoke again.

Chapter 241: Paying Back the Money

"What? You said what?" Xu Yuansheng seemed to not believe his ears. His smiling face instantly stiffened.

"Done!" Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran now felt the same as Ying Hongtu. Perhaps even more uncomfortable, since they were known by everyone in the Water Source Monastery.

"You two owe me money!" Luo Tian's face bore innocence, as if he didn't know why Xu Yuansheng was so upset.

"Senior Brother Tu and Senior Brother Pang, come here!" Xu Yuansheng almost roared their names.

The surrounding Water Source Monastery disciples looked in disbelief at Tu Yuenzheng. They instantly understood why they had reacted so strongly when hearing Ying Hongtu called a fool. It turned out they were also in the same situation as Ying Hongtu, owing money to him.

"Grand Elder..." Tu Yuenzheng and Pang Haoran looked at Xu Yuansheng with red faces, unsure what to say.
