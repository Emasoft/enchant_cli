Chapter 844: Returning Home

On the Fengshen Continent, Luo Tian's face bore an expression of disdain as he gazed at the eight sources of original power converging toward him in the sky.

Luo Tian stood motionless, allowing the eight sources of original power to transform into eight long dragons roaring as they flew toward him.

The formidable original power struck Luo Tian's body, causing the Ming Shou to display a joyous expression. It had not expected Luo Tian to dare accept his attack so recklessly.

"You are no longer capable of harming me at all!" Luo Tian's voice rang out, and the eight original power dragons instantly disintegrated upon striking him. Luo Tian's figure then appeared before the Ming Shou.

"This..." The Ming Shou trembled, stunned by Luo Tian's overwhelming strength even after ascending to the Supreme Realm. His full-force strike had failed to inflict a single scratch on Luo Tian.

Faced with such an overwhelming Luo Tian, the Ming Shou lacked any desire to fight. Its massive body surged downward into the River of Shadows.

"Capturing a Ming Shou instead of the Yomingshui is not a wasted journey. Come, follow me back to the sect. Let my Tianyuan Sect disciples sense your original power and enhance our sect's overall strength!" Luo Tian chuckled, his hands flashing with seals. The seals transformed into chains that flew toward the diving Ming Shou.

In the blink of an eye, Luo Tian's seals reached the Ming Shou's colossal form, wrapping it tightly. A surge of sealing power radiated from the seals, constricting the Ming Shou's body.

"Ah... break!" The Ming Shou roared, bellowing as the gray River of Shadows surged to a hundred feet high. Yet the seals remained unmoved.

"No use. Come forth!" Luo Tian extended his hand toward the void, lifting it upward. The seal chains formed a vast net, hoisting the Ming Shou's massive body into the air.

The Ming Shou howled skyward, its eight heads glowing with radiant light as it expanded in size. Yet the seal chains remained impervious to its might.

"Seal..." Luo Tian gestured, releasing a powerful sealing force. The seals radiated brilliant light, flashing repeatedly across the Ming Shou's body.

"A hum..." The resonance spread as the colossal Ming Shou shrank gradually, eventually reducing to palm-sized and landing in Luo Tian's hand.

The miniature Ming Shou roared within Luo Tian's palm, its eight eyes flashing with fierce determination.

Yet the smaller Ming Shou appeared more endearing, rolling about on Luo Tian's palm as he lightly patted it. "Be quiet!"

Luo Tian's actions infuriated the Ming Shou, for what was it? A being destined to ascend to the Sage Realm through boundless growth.

Now, it was reduced to a mere pet in Luo Tian's palm, and the action resembled training a dog.

"Roar..." The Ming Shou howled, seeking to vent its frustration, but the sound no longer thundered as before. It was barely louder than a fly's buzz, prompting Luo Tian to smile again.

"Enough of this. I have no time to waste!" Luo Tian spoke without delay, his black hair slowly sprouting a strand that wrapped around the Ming Shou and hung from his hair. His figure flickered, vanishing beyond the Fengshen Continent.

Nan Gong Yuqing and others bore anxious expressions, awaiting Luo Tian's return. The earth-shaking explosion earlier had filled them with dread, and the terrifying resonance that escaped the Fengshen Continent deepened their concern.

"Rest assured, this boy's strength is among the best even in the Supreme Realm. Moreover, he possesses many methods. He moved us out to ensure we were unharmed!" The ancient tortoise Xuanwu spoke reassuringly, his eyes filled with confidence.

As the oldest being in the Four Sacred Star Domains, Xuanwu had witnessed Supreme Realm battles. Yet to him, Luo Tian would rank among the top three of all Supreme Beings he had seen.

"Indeed, a prodigy from the Tianyuan Continent. He truly carries the aura of the greatest generation of that land!" Xuanwu's face bore admiration, recalling the era when Tianyuan was teeming with talent.

Hearing Xuanwu's reassurance, Nan Gong Yuqing and others eased slightly. At the same time, Luo Tian's figure appeared before them.

When they saw Luo Tian emerge, their hearts finally relaxed. Though his aura was slightly weakened, his spiritual energy remained robust.

As soon as Luo Tian appeared, he extended his hand, and a stream of seals flew from his fingers into Nan Gong Yuqing and Xuanwu's bodies.

They did not resist but shuddered, their faces lighting up with joy as they closed their eyes to absorb the information Luo Tian transmitted through the seals.

"This is the insight from Zhang Jinshu's tome. How much you grasp and how long it takes to ascend to the Supreme Realm is your own matter!" Luo Tian sighed softly, addressing Nan Gong Yuqing and Xuanwu.

"Thank you!" Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, though he felt the gratitude was trivial, yet he still spoke it aloud.

"The insight into Supreme Realm—this is something every至尊 (Supreme Being) would covet! It's truly precious!" Xuanwu sighed, his face filled with admiration.

Sha Cangmang and the others of Qinglong Sect stood in the void, their faces showing eagerness but remaining silent. Sha Cangmang was already at the threshold of the Supreme Realm; if he could obtain Luo Tian's insight, he would surely enter it immediately.

Yet, given Luo Tian's relationship with Qinglong Sect, he would not give such a precious insight to Sha Cangmang for free.

"Sha Sect Leader, you must be aware of the current situation. The divine race has extended its claws into the Four Sacred Star Domains. As the weakest of the Nine Domains, if we continue fighting among ourselves, the Four Sacred Star Domains will surely be devoured by the other domains!"

"I hope you can issue a statement to apologize for what happened with Tianyuan Sect. We could form an alliance. Otherwise, I can only apologize!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with a threatening gaze as he addressed Sha Cangmang.

If it were Luo Tian's past self, Qinglong Sect would have no reason to exist. With his current strength, he could easily destroy Qinglong Sect. However, doing so would weaken the Four Sacred Star Domains again, leaving no chance to face those nine elders. Moreover, the divine race's strength was formidable; having killed so many of them, their pride would not let this pass.

"Of course, as an ally, I will also send the insight into the Supreme Realm. And if Qinglong Sect faces trouble, my Tianyuan Sect will spare no effort to assist!" Luo Tian's face bore sincerity as he looked at Sha Cangmang.

"Let me consider it! I'll give you an answer in a month!" Sha Cangmang's aged face showed contemplation. On one hand was the temptation of the Supreme Realm, on the other the sect's prestige—Sha Cangmang was torn. In truth, he agreed with Luo Tian's approach; a mere apology paled in comparison to the Supreme Realm.

"Good!" Luo Tian did not press further, addressing Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming: "You all return to Tianyuan Sect first. Inform the sect that the entire order will relocate to the Tianyuan Continent. I'll go ahead, and you organize yourselves before meeting me on the Tianyuan Continent!"

Luo Tian's words made Qinglong Sect members tense. They knew Luo Tian was about to fully draw the Tianyuan Continent back into the Four Sacred Star Domains' focus.

"Yes!" Ma Yingming and Tu Hongfei dared not delay, bowing in compliance.

"Master Nan Gong, I also need to ask a favor. Use your warship to transport Tianyuan Sect disciples to the Tianyuan Continent. I'll provide the location shortly!" Luo Tian addressed Nan Gong Yuqing.

Nan Gong Yuqing nodded slightly; even without Luo Tian's words, he would have done so.

"Goodbye, everyone! We'll meet on the Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Tian bowed to Nan Gong Yuqing and others, his face showing excitement as he flickered toward the north of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Go!" Nan Gong Yuqing and others also bowed to Xuanwu and Chen Xuanning, becoming streaks of light toward the Eastping Continent.

At once, only a few Qinglong Sect members and Xuanwu and Chen Xuanning remained on the Fengshen Continent.

"Old Sha, don't be stubborn. We four sects were wrong before. Now Luo Tian's strength could easily destroy both our sects. If you persist, Qinglong Sect may fall due to your mistake!" Chen Xuanning's gaze carried sorrow. Now only the two of them remained; Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian were dead or fled. Chen Xuanning did not want Sha Cangmang to make another mistake.

"I understand," Sha Cangmang nodded, his eyes showing resolve as he chased after Nan Gong Yuqing's direction.

"Good, the Four Sacred Star Domains should remain stable for a while!" Xuanwu materialized his true form, and Chen Xuanning vanished beyond the Fengshen Continent. The Fengshen Continent fell into silence once more.

On the Fengshen Continent, within an unremarkable ruin, waves of heat rose continuously. A deep fissure seemed to split the entire continent.

Within the black fissure, a golden light slowly ascended, emerging from the chasm. As the light faded, an object resembling gold foil expanded until it finally opened, revealing two figures stepping out.

"Luo Tian, I demand your death! No one has ever offended the divine race and lived!" Sun Mingtian and his nephew stood on the ruin, their faces pale with hatred as they roared.

Chapter 845: Passing Through Xiangu

Amidst the endless stars, within the vast Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian's face bore excitement as he穿梭 (zhuān suō) through the void, his figure moving at an unparalleled speed.

It had been nearly seven days since Luo Tian had exited the Fengshen Continent, and he had not rested for a moment, continuously flying toward the Tianyuan Continent.

Though he had flown for seven days, the black whirlpool in his dantian had not diminished but returned to its peak state. Luo Tian's injuries were fully restored within these seven days.

"Almost there... almost there!" Luo Tian marveled at the vastness of the Four Sacred Star Domains while mentally calculating his distance to the Tianyuan Continent.

"Three days, and I'll be back on the Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, his figure appearing on an uninhabited planet. He gazed at the distant shining stars, knowing one of them was his hometown, the Tianyuan Continent.

Time passed swiftly; under Luo Tian's continuous flight and calculation, he flew for two more days. His gaze fell upon a nearby continent.

"A familiar feeling!" Luo Tian muttered, instantly appearing above the continent.

"Xiangu Continent!" Luo Tian's eyebrows lifted as his formidable spiritual sense probed the land. A single probe revealed why this continent felt familiar.

"Let's go see!" Luo Tian's face bore a brief sorrow, recalling the Tian Dao Sect's Si Tu Chen and his past experiences on the Xiangu Continent.

As Luo Tian stepped into the Xiangu Continent, his vast spiritual sense instantly enveloped the entire land.

Before leaving the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian had felt it and Xiangu Continent as immense. Now a Supreme Being, he was among the Four Sacred Star Domains' peak beings. His eyes were no longer ordinary; the Xiangu Continent's size seemed insignificant, and its state appeared in Luo Tian's mind.

Feeling the Xiangu Continent's desolation, Luo Tian sighed, his figure flickering to the old site of the Tian Dao Sect.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian let out a soft sound, his formidable perception sensing waves beneath the ground.

"Rebirth Bridge!" Luo Tian's eyes lit up with joy. His spiritual sense revealed a gray river flowing beneath the old site of the Tian Dao Sect, ten thousand feet deep. A black bridge stood over the river—the very Rebirth Bridge Luo Tian had once crossed.

"The Tianyuan and Xiangu Continents were originally one, but the Saint of the Ming Domain once swept them into three parts. The Wangyue Continent has already collided with Xiangu, leaving only these two fragments of the Tianyuan Continent!"

"Thus, I shall bring Xiangu back to the Tianyuan Continent today, reuniting these two fragments!" Luo Tian's eyes bore determination. He unleashed a stream of seals from his body, flying toward the desolate Xiangu Continent's edges.

Luo Tian took a step forward, walking across the Xiangu Continent for half a day. His face grew pale, sweat slowly dripping from his cheeks.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian reappeared outside the Xiangu Continent, his face filled with a smile. He roared lowly: "Rise!"

As Luo Tian's roar echoed, the vast array of seals he had spent half a day creating radiated brilliant light. The seals transformed into dragons, forming a barrier that enveloped the entire Xiangu Continent. The seal dragons roamed along the barrier's surface.

Luo Tian flew to the bottom of the floating Xiangu Continent in space, gritting his teeth. His dantian's black whirlpool spun at its peak. His arms bulged with veins as he placed his hands on the barrier.

"Move..." Luo Tian roared, his figure slowly flying forward. More astonishingly, the massive Xiangu Continent followed Luo Tian's movement. If anyone saw this, they would be stunned.

A person carrying an entire continent—only Luo Tian could achieve such a feat. Though he was now a Supreme Being, carrying an entire Xiangu Continent was clearly taxing; his speed slowed.

From a distance, Luo Tian's presence was undetectable—only the continent surrounded by barriers could be seen, drifting through space.

"One day... two days..." This took four days longer than expected. Finally, Luo Tian carried the Xiangu Continent to a slightly smaller planet.

Luo Tian stepped out from beneath the Xiangu Continent, his face filled with excitement as he gazed at the nearby planet with a slight blue hue: "Tianyuan Continent, I'm back!"

Luo Tian did not rush into the Tianyuan Continent immediately. Instead, he coldly observed the four-color original power seals forming a barrier around it.

Like four giant dragons, they roamed in the four directions of the Tianyuan Continent, emitting roaring and phoenix cries. A stream of rule forces enveloped the entire Tianyuan Continent.

"This must be what the four sects' former masters set up!" Luo Tian's face bore a cold smile, his eyes flashing with killing intent.

"Sha Cangmang, if you don't comply this time, Qinglong Sect has no reason to exist!" Luo Tian's voice carried endless coldness, echoing through the void.

Luo Tian's mood was not so bad initially. However, upon seeing these four rule force dragon seals, his face turned icy.

If it weren't for these four cursed rule force seals, the Tianyuan Continent would not have been so weak against the Ming Domain's invasion.

"From now on, there are no Supreme Beings!" Those four bold words echoed in Luo Tian's ears, reigniting his anger.

Though the four sects' former masters were gone, their sects endured. Zhuque Sect and Baitu Sect had been destroyed by him; Xuanwu Sect had changed. Only Qinglong Sect remained, reigniting Luo Tian's desire to kill.

"Break!" Luo Tian extended his hand, Supreme Force forming a massive hand that instantly凝聚 (níng jù). He lunged toward the four roaming dragons.

Feeling the massive hand's power, the four seal dragons roared and transformed into four divine beast shadows, rushing toward Luo Tian's hand.

"Foolish insects! Get out of my way!" Luo Tian saw the four seal dragons daring to resist and sneered, his hand slamming down. The massive hand enveloped the four divine beast shadows.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's current strength was beyond comparison. How could the seals set by Jianguan, a Nine-source Supreme Being, withstand him? The moment they touched, the four divine beast shadows were instantly reduced to original power and vanished into the endless void.

Luo Tian's actions were effortless. He turned his gaze to the barrier outside the Tianyuan Continent, which radiated waves of light. A stream of time force entered his perception.

"This must be the sealing array set by Jiang Nanxuan!" Luo Tian's eyes bore admiration, marveling at Jiang Nanxuan's mastery of formations. Even as a界尊 (Boundary Master), he had created an array with time force.

Through the formation, Luo Tian could see the golden纪元之书 (Ji Yuan Zhi Shu) hanging high on the Tianyuan Continent, still radiating golden light.

"What is this Ji Yuan Zhi Shu's origin?" Luo Tian's eyes bore contemplation. At this moment, the Ji Yuan Zhi Shu seemed even more mysterious to him.

His spiritual sense probed into the formation, his face softening slightly. He saw familiar faces on the Tianyuan Continent, and tears welled in his eyes.

"I didn't come back too late!" Luo Tian took a long breath, relieved to see his family and friends still in the state they were when he left. His heart finally relaxed.

At the same time, Luo Tian saw those black-cloaked figures emerging from the Ming Domain. Though they had once seemed formidable to him, now they were like ants. He knew killing them would take only a thought.

Even the high-ranking imperial robe masters, once towering over him, were now insignificant and posed no threat.

"Enter! The Tianyuan Continent, I, Luo Tian, have returned!" Luo Tian's face bore a gentle smile. He pointed his finger, and a golden seal flew from his hand, carrying waves of time force. It attached to the barrier outside the Tianyuan Continent.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian's seal descended, it was like a raindrop falling into calm water. The barrier rippled with waves.

Time passed slowly. Before long, the barrier set by Jiang Nanxuan vanished before Luo Tian's eyes.

Luo Tian's face bore excitement as he appeared above the Tianyuan Continent, feeling its familiar aura. He greedily inhaled.

"The Tianyuan Continent has not changed! It's still so weak, but from today on, no one will harm it. Because this is my hometown, where my family and friends are!" Luo Tian's voice carried endless arrogance, echoing through the heavens.

"Luo Tian has returned!" People who had regained consciousness bore excitement on their faces, gazing at Luo Tian standing proudly above the Tianyuan Continent. Though they had not yet regained movement, they could feel their bodies slowly regaining sensation.

"I said this kid would return soon, right? That's why we regained consciousness early!" Everyone's eyes filled with tears of excitement. Even the carefree Gu Lei and Xu Lizi were overwhelmed.

"Finally, he's back!" Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan maintained their mutual gaze, both seeing excitement in each other's eyes.

Luo Tian did not address the people whose bodies were slowly regaining consciousness. He flew toward his parents, Luo Nantian and Luo Xiong, kneeling to the ground. "Foolish son, I have returned!"

Chapter 846: The Tianyuan Battle Flag

The Tianyuan Continent, sealed for years, had been silent. Today, it slowly revived. People stood or lay down, regaining consciousness as the seal was broken. Their faces bore confusion, their eyes gradually regaining vitality.

For commoners, it was nothing significant—everything seemed unchanged. But for cultivators, they knew the seal had been broken. They did not know who broke it. If it were those terrifying figures emerging from the Ji Yuan Zhi Shu, it would be a disaster continuing.

Yet people's memories involuntarily recalled that young man who had left his homeland years ago. Their faces bore bitter expressions.

A few years—nothing more than a blink for cultivators, even enough to ascend from the Soul-Formation Stage to the Soul-Merging Stage. How could that young man have ascended to the legendary Supreme Realm and returned to break the seal?

At this moment, people's minds saw that young man kneeling before Luo Nantian and Luo Xiong, his face filled with excitement. Tears glistened in his eyes: "Foolish son, I have returned!"

Luo Tian's voice echoed across the Tianyuan Continent. The people who had lost hope bore shock, then a wave of joy surged through the Tianyuan Continent.

Time passed swiftly. In just a moment, those who had regained consciousness and were close to Luo Tian fully recovered their ability to move. They rushed toward Luo Tian with shouts.

A crowd surrounded Luo Tian, their eyes filled with excitement. They were overwhelmed and could not find words.

"Good child, you're back!" Luo Nantian's eyes were moist, while his wife Zhang Qiuyue embraced Luo Tian tightly. Tears glistened in her eyes; she could imagine the hardships her son had endured away from home.

"Good to have you back, good to have you back!" Zhang Qiuyue's eyes showed affection. Seeing the slight aging on Luo Tian's face, she felt heartbroken.

Luo Nantian and Luo Xiong were also filled with joy. They knew Luo Tian was not reckless; if he had no absolute confidence, he would never have returned to break the seal.

"Haha, Luo Tian has returned! I said why we regained consciousness so soon!" Gu Lei and Xu Lizi laughed, standing behind Luo Tian. To them, as long as Luo Tian returned, the crisis on the Tianyuan Continent would be resolved. Nothing was beyond Luo Tian's ability.

"Luo... Luo Tian..." Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan stood behind Luo Tian, their beautiful faces streaming tears. These days, after regaining consciousness, they had countless thoughts—why had their consciousness returned? Fear of never seeing Luo Tian again haunted them.

Seeing Luo Tian now, they could not help but be excited. However, due to Luo Nantian and Luo Xiong's presence, they would have rushed into his arms otherwise.

"Good, child, look at your two little wives. I've accepted them. If you do anything to hurt the two girls, I won't forgive you!" Zhang Qiuyue smiled and pushed Luo Tian toward Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

Pushed by Zhang Qiuyue, Luo Tian's body fell directly before Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

Seeing their tear-streaked faces, Luo Tian's eyes showed endless tenderness. He embraced them tightly and whispered: "Qianxue, Qiuchan, I'm back!"

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan felt the familiar embrace, the familiar warmth. They said nothing but embraced Luo Tian tightly, finally stopping their tears. Their faces regained softness as they stood together with Luo Tian, forgetting others' presence.

In the past, these two conservative girls would never have made such a display in front of so many people. But now, their hearts were filled with the joy of reunion. They cared little for others' feelings.

The three stood embracing, and those around them bore joyous expressions without disturbing Luo Tian's trio.

Above the sky, the Ji Yuan Zhi Shu resumed its flow of blood energy after the seal was broken. The massive reincarnation channel, previously frozen, released gray残魂 (cannibal souls) from the passage.

"Ah... ah..." A series of screams echoed in Luo Tian's mind, startling him. His face turned cold with killing intent as his eyes flashed two beams of cold light. He slowly released Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

With the seal broken, those black-cloaked figures and Tianyuan Continent people who had been in the act of killing gradually regained consciousness. After a brief moment, they resumed fighting.

The screams pulled everyone back to the joy of their reunion, making people's faces bear a cold expression.

"Tian'er, this..."

At this moment, Luo Tian was undoubtedly the people's pillar of hope. Everyone turned their gazes toward him.

"Haha, I never expected the people on the Tianyuan Continent to be so foolish as to break their own seal. Should I thank you or thank you again?" A cold voice echoed in people's ears as the imperial robe figure slowly stepped out from the golden Ji Yuan Zhi Shu.

"Come on, who broke the seal? It saved me years of effort. I should thank you!" The imperial robe figure smiled, scanning the crowd with his eyes.

"Ah? Not bad! Your cultivation isn't suppressed either. That's a great blessing!" The black-cloaked imperial robe figure clenched his fists, smiling as he felt his strength. He looked at Gu Lei and others on the ground—only Gu Lei, Long Jie, and Jiang Nanxuan were Boundary Masters. In front of his restored strength, they were like ants. A single step would crush them into dust.

"No problem! The Tianyuan Continent's grudge is settled!" Luo Tian's face bore coldness as he gazed at the imperial robe figure. He felt the man's cultivation and smiled.

"Eight-source Supreme Being? Haha, a small Eight-source Supreme Being. If you were in the Four Sacred Star Domains, you might have some ability. But as for you, an Eight-source in the Ming Domain, you're just a low-ranking soldier!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed through the air, startling the imperial robe figure.

"You are..." The imperial robe figure's face bore fear, finally recognizing Luo Tian among the crowd.

The imperial robe figure felt a sense of dread upon seeing Luo Tian, for he had not sensed Luo Tian's presence when he stepped out. This was rare unless the opponent's cultivation was far superior. Even a Nine-source would be unable to hide their presence if they were that much weaker.

"You... have returned!" After years, the imperial robe figure finally recalled that young man who had once been like a homeless dog. He never expected Luo Tian to return so quickly.

"Yes, I've returned. Your time has come!" Luo Tian's face bore a smile as he gazed at the man in the sky.

"Ah... hahaha! My cultivation has returned! It's not suppressed!" A series of voices echoed in people's ears. Waves of strength that made Gu Lei and other Boundary Masters shudder appeared, causing them to bear great fear.

"Luo Tian, what should we do?" Jiang Nanxuan, though wise, was powerless against absolute crushing strength. The waves of strength, even one, could crush them.

"Jiang Xiong, rest assured. Since I've returned, I won't let the Tianyuan Continent suffer any more!" Luo Tian's eyes bore disdain. He took out his soul banner.

As the soul banner appeared, people on the Tianyuan Continent slightly changed faces. Everyone trembled, a strong urge to kneel before the soul banner rising in their minds—no matter how they suppressed it, it would not fade.

"Luo Tian has fulfilled his promise and brought back the ancestors of the Tianyuan Continent. But some want to massacre and wash our Tianyuan Continent. Our homeland, I beg the ancestors to help us protect it!" Luo Tian's eyes were moist as he knelt before the soul banner, which was once the Tianyuan Battle Flag.

"Home..." Luo Tian's words echoed, and a low, confused, joyful, and sorrowful sound emerged from the soul banner.

People on the Tianyuan Continent did not know why, but this emotion immediately infected them. Their legs could no longer control themselves, and they fell to their knees before the soul banner. Even those fighting black-cloaked figures stopped, ignoring the knives raised toward their necks.

"Idiots!" A one Boundary Master black-cloaked figure sneered, his long sword slicing toward a soul-formation stage Tianyuan Continent person.

This scene played out in every corner of the Tianyuan Continent, but Luo Tian did not stop it. His face bore devotion.

"Grr..." A series of groans echoed from the soul banner, and the black soul banner fluttered in the wind. The golden characters "Tianyuan" on it gradually dimmed, and time on the Tianyuan Continent seemed to freeze. Everyone's actions stopped, but those around Luo Tian were unaffected, their eyes filled with reverence as they followed him, kneeling before the soul banner.

"Roar..." A series of gray, solid残魂 (cannibal souls) appeared in people's sight.

Chapter 847: Rebuilding the Reincarnation

On the Tianyuan Continent, the black soul banner fluttered in the wind. Time across the world seemed to freeze as a gray, solid残魂 (cannibal soul) appeared before everyone.

"Nine-source! A single残魂 (cannibal soul) is already at the Nine-source level!" Seeing the gray残魂 (cannibal soul), the imperial robe figure in the sky bore fear, whispering.

However, he soon showed disdain: "Nine-source? Still a残魂 (cannibal soul). How could it be my opponent? This is your reliance to return? If so, you're too naive. Since you left this continent, you must know our Ming Domain's strength. A Nine-source残魂 (cannibal soul) is nothing!"

Luo Tian ignored the imperial robe figure's words, gazing at him briefly. That glance seemed to look at a fool before turning his gaze back to the soul banner.

"Roar..." Before the imperial robe figure's words ended, it seemed to ignite a fuse. The soul banner surged with gray mist, and low growls echoed in people's ears.

"One... two..." Waves of gray mist continuously emerged from the soul banner, each carrying an overwhelming aura that stunned everyone.

Each残魂 (cannibal soul) appeared, bowing to Luo Tian with gratitude before flying toward the four corners of the Tianyuan Continent.

"Fight!" Luo Tian's face bore a gentle smile as he addressed the残魂 (cannibal souls). He knew these残魂 (cannibal souls) had no intent to harm his people, but they were dangerous for others due to their deep resentment.

"Fight..." Countless残魂 (cannibal souls) filled the Tianyuan Continent, roaring as they rushed toward the black-cloaked Ming Domain figures.

The imperial robe figure in the sky was stunned, his face filled with fear. He never expected Luo Tian to bring so many残魂 (cannibal souls). Each powerful Nine-source残魂 (cannibal soul) felt like a massive hammer, striking the man's heart.

"This terrifying strength could rival the first level of the Ming Domain!" The imperial robe figure did not hesitate, turning to flee into the channel opened by the Ji Yuan Zhi Shu that continuously bled.

"Let you go?" A cold voice echoed in the imperial robe figure's mind as immense pressure instantly surrounded him, trapping him like a swamp.

Luo Tian bore a playful expression as he stood up slowly. He extended his hand, and the imperial robe figure instantly appeared before him, his throat clutched. His eyes bore endless fear.

"Where is your former arrogance? Are you afraid now? Do you also fear?" Luo Tian's hands tightened, producing a crackling sound.

"Rest assured, I won't let you die easily. Letting you die would be too kind!" Luo Tian's eyes bore mockery as he placed seals on the man, filling his body with them. He sealed the man's Nine-source cultivation and handed him to Gu Lei, who excelled at torment.

"Torment him, but don't let him die!" Luo Tian smiled as he addressed Gu Lei. His gaze turned to the reincarnation channel previously broken by Yang Huanyu.

As for the other Ming Domain figures, Luo Tian naturally did not care. Against the Tianyuan残魂 (cannibal souls), even a Nine-source would be crushed.
