“Ah…” Upon hearing Xuan Dan’s words, the crowd murmured in surprise. Soon after, many people gritted their teeth and approached Lo Tian standing there, handing him the storage pouches in their hands.

“Brother, my name is Liu Erlong. Remember that!” A burly man spoke to Lo Tian.

“Hmph!” Lo Tian accepted the storage pouch and nodded. He then continued receiving them incessantly.

Cen Weihong and Tian Hongyun also began to busy themselves. Within an hour, each of the three men held a hundred or so storage pouches.

“Son, take these. Listen—there are some fine items at the auction. Here is an invitation. When you see something good, buy it!” Xuan Dan smiled and addressed Lo Tian and the others.

“Thank you, Master Xuan!” Tian Hongyun’s face lit up with excitement upon seeing the storage pouches. He had just glanced inside and realized the wealth within was astonishing.

“Go!” Xuan Dan handed the golden invitation to Lo Tian and his companions. Upon opening it, Lo Tian saw that it listed many spiritual items, leaving him in awe at the quality of the Huantian Auction. Even mid-tier celestial techniques from the Immortal Realm were among them.

Chapter 1887: Reunion of Brothers

The Huantian Auction, organized by the Huantian Island, was enough to draw most of Huantian City’s residents. Yet it was merely an attraction—everyone knew that even if they sold everything, they might only acquire one or two items.

Lo Tian and his companions walked along the bustling streets. Tian Hongyun’s face was filled with excitement; the numerous storage pouches he had received meant his wealth now far exceeded what he had accumulated over years.

Throughout the journey, Tian Hongyun constantly praised Cen Weihong, believing he had benefited from Cen Weihong’s favor since the latter was Xuan Dan’s direct disciple.

“Lo Tian Senior, why didn’t you say thanks? Though you and Cen Senior are close, you should still express gratitude. That’s basic etiquette! Without Cen Senior, how could you have so many spirit stones and treasures so easily?” Tian Hongyun was unpleased with Lo Tian’s silence.

“Thank you, Cen Senior!” Lo Tian smiled upon hearing Tian Hongyun’s words. He knew well what Tian Hongyun was trying to do—sowing discord between himself and Cen Weihong.

As for Lo Tian’s reputation as a prodigy, Tian Hongyun thought it was merely Cen Weihong deliberately yielding to him.

“Hmph.” Cen Weihong’s face darkened, his disdain for Tian Hongyun deepening.

“Someone is confronting!” Just as Tian Hongyun was about to mock again, the crowd stirred.

“Who? Who dares cause trouble on Huantian Island?” The people murmured, more curious about who dared challenge the island’s authority than the auction in Huantian City.

“Cen Senior, let’s go see too!” Tian Hongyun was clearly fond of chaos. Upon hearing the murmurs, he felt intrigued.

“Let’s go!” Lo Tian heard the commotion and recalled the ancient warship that had followed them upon landing.

“Were they from the ship? Why does it feel familiar? I must see—otherwise my heart won’t rest!” Lo Tian thought to himself. If something felt familiar, it could only be his family or friends.

Soon after, Lo Tian and the others reached the crowd. Before even pushing through, Lo Tian heard a cacophony of curses.

“Old dog! Come on, catch me! Kill us? You dare?” The voice was sharp but made Lo Tian’s body tremble, his steps quickening as he pushed through the crowd.

Upon seeing the opposing figures, Lo Tian’s eyes turned red. His eyes glistened with moisture; his body trembled as if thousands of words were caught in his throat.

“Nan Gong Yuqing… Li Tianzhi…” The figures buried deep in memory instantly appeared in Lo Tian’s mind, merging with the present.

“Old bastard! You dare attack us? Do you know who we are? Students of Star River Palace. Dare to touch us?” Ren Hongzhe, with his big mouth, kept speaking, voice laced with contempt.

“Exactly! Old dog, being an Immortal doesn’t mean much. Do you dare to grab me? What kind of claws do you have?” A purple phoenix lazily perched on Nan Gong Yuqing’s shoulder, speaking in human language.

Opposite them stood Huang Youshan, his face flushed red. He wanted to retaliate but had no chance. Even the senior immortal beside him trembled with anger, his overwhelming aura crushing Nan Gong Yuqing’s group—yet it had no effect.

“Outsiders of Star River Palace’s outer sect! How dare you speak to me like that? Do you know who I am? If you’re wise, hand over the purple phoenix to me and kneel to beg for mercy. Otherwise, when I reach the Middle Three Heavens, I’ll let you wish for death!” Huang Youshan shouted.

“You damned fool! Even if you’re the Immortal King’s disciple, I’d have beaten you down long ago if it weren’t for this Huantian City!” Wan Lingkong shouted without hesitation.

“Those bastards haven’t changed at all…” Lo Tian smiled faintly, his face showing a gentle smile. That was his brother.

“Who dares cause trouble on Huantian Island?” As the two groups exchanged curses, a loud voice echoed. A group of guards stepped out from the crowd.

“Haha! Brother, do you recognize me? These people stole my pet. Don’t return it to me? You should handle this, since I’m also a resident of Huantian Island!” Huang Youshan saw the head guard and laughed.

“Don’t you know that Huantian Island forbids trouble? Return their things immediately!” The head guard’s face was cold as he addressed Nan Gong Yuqing and his group, causing their faces to darken instantly.

Even a fool could see the head guard was in cahoots with Huang Youshan, clearly favoring him.

“You, a Huantian Island guard, dare to be biased. Is this the rule of Huantian Island?” Wan Lingkong shouted, but Nan Gong Yuqing and his group stood together, eyes showing caution.

“Black crows all look the same!” Lo Tian’s face was cold. If they truly attacked, he wouldn’t hesitate—exposing himself to fight alongside Nan Gong Yuqing and his companions.

“Exactly! How does Huantian Island treat its residents like this?” Lo Tian shouted, his voice mocking.

“We pay ten thousand spirit stones daily to live here. The guards act corruptly—does that honor our payment?” Lo Tian’s voice echoed, drawing the crowd’s agreement.

All consumers share a common enemy: merchants. No matter who they are, they feel like kings when spending money; any flaw makes them discontent.

“Exactly! How dare you treat us like fools? Huantian Island can’t do this!” Hearing Lo Tian’s words, the crowd murmured.

“Who? Have the guts and come out!” The head guard’s face changed upon hearing Lo Tian. He roared into the crowd.

“Me? What’s wrong with me?” Lo Tian stepped forward, smiling as he exited the crowd.

“Haha…” Upon seeing Lo Tian step out, Nan Gong Yuqing, Li Tianzhi, and Wan Lingkong burst into laughter. Their eyes looked at Lo Tian with excitement but concealed it.

“You son, what are you? Who gave you the right to speak?” The guard’s face darkened. Though only at the mid-Tianxian (Celestial Immortal) stage, his backer made him untouchable on Huantian Island.

“Lo Senior, what are you doing? This is clearly seeking trouble for yourself!” Tian Hongyun, seeing Lo Tian’s actions, felt anxious but his eyes showed a hint of satisfaction.

“Get lost!” Cen Weihong, seeing Tian Hongyun’s expression, frowned and kicked him.

“Do you think you can judge me? If you want to catch me, give me a reason. What did I do?”

“You dare attack us! Who are you to speak like that?” The remaining guards saw their head leader convulsing on the ground and their faces changed instantly.

“Everyone, fight! These bastards aren’t human!” Someone in the crowd shouted and pushed someone out.

Lo Tian signaled Nan Gong Yuqing not to fight. He slapped a guard, then grabbed the head leader and hurled him into the crowd.

“Smack…” The clear sound of a slap echoed. The head guard was sent flying, stunned and knocked out.

Silence. This slap silenced the scene entirely. Everyone’s faces showed disbelief, even Huang Youshan’s accompanying senior immortal was shocked.

“Who is this?”

“So strong, even daring to slap a Huantian Island person. My god, did I not see correctly!” People stared at Lo Tian in bewilderment. It was the first time anyone had slapped a Huantian Island person in years, yet people felt secretly pleased and eager.

“Daring! How dare you attack us!” The remaining guards saw their head leader convulsing and changed faces.

“Fight together! These bastards aren’t human!” The crowd shouted, one person pushed out.

Lo Tian signaled Nan Gong Yuqing to hold back. He slapped a guard and hurled him into the crowd. Each time one fell, many rushed in to beat the guards.

An uprising—within moments, people gathered more and more. The street was in chaos. After beating several guards, Lo Tian signaled Nan Gong Yuqing and they slipped into the crowd.

“Let’s go!” Nan Gong Yuqing and his group didn’t hesitate, dispersing to leave the crowd.

Huang Youshan was protected by his accompanying senior immortal. Lo Tian left without being recognized, unaware of his identity—after all, who dared slap a Huantian Island person? His status must be extraordinary.

Lo Tian took the Thousand Mirage Mask and slipped out of the crowd, heading to the agreed spot with Nan Gong Yuqing.

As soon as he left a little distance, Cen Weihong appeared behind him, still with his cold expression as if nothing had happened.

Not long after, Lo Tian arrived at an unassuming inn. Upon reaching the door, he saw Nan Gong Yuqing and his group rushing in as well.

“Brothers!” Lo Tian laughed, leaping toward Nan Gong Yuqing and his group.

Chapter 1889: Sky-High Reward

“Lonely?”

Seeing Nan Gong Yuqing and his group exit the inn, Lo Tian didn’t rush to leave. He looked at Cen Weihong sitting silently, speaking softly.

“Used to it.” Cen Weihong shook his head gently. His face returned to its icy expression.

“Why haven’t you removed the scars on your face after killing Li Piaoyun?” Lo Tian raised his cup, clinking it with Cen Weihong’s. This surprised Cen Weihong; he hadn’t clinked a cup with anyone in ages, as no one was worth it.

“You trust them?” Cen Weihong didn’t respond but spoke softly. He could sense Lo Tian’s feelings for them, like his own toward Li Piaoyun—perhaps even more.

“You carry your wounds alone. Time is the best test of people’s hearts. I’ve known them for thousands of years, experienced countless deaths together. I’ve fought for them; they’ve been injured for me!” Lo Tian’s face softened. His greatest luck was meeting these people; without them, he wouldn’t have reached today.

“Go. Think it over yourself.” Lo Tian saw Cen Weihong’s confusion and sighed.

“However, carrying everything alone is exhausting!” Lo Tian stepped out of the inn, leaving Cen Weihong with those final words.

Cen Weihong’s eyes seemed to understand, but he shook his head and followed Lo Tian.

“Guest, your bill isn’t settled yet!” As the two stepped out, a servant approached with a trademark smile.

“Hmph. How much?” Lo Tian nodded without concern, patting his storage ring.

“Total twenty-one thousand spirit stones!” The servant announced loudly, smiling all the while. His gaze was assessing Lo Tian.

“M-more? How much?” Upon hearing the servant’s words, Lo Tian’s face changed. He glared at the servant, anger on his face.

“Liar! I just had a meal. Three thousand spirit stones was enough, but you’re demanding twenty-one thousand! How about robbing? Black shop, absolutely a black shop!” Lo Tian cursed loudly, his voice filled with anger.

Lo Tian knew things in Huantian City were expensive, but he hadn’t expected them to be this costly. He had checked the menu before.

“Black shop! Definitely a black shop! Be honest, how much? Otherwise, believe me, I’ll smash your store!” Lo Tian shouted at the servant.

“Guest, you did order three thousand spirit stones. However, your friends took some things when they left—taking a third of the inn’s wine cellar. Naturally, those costs must be added to your bill!” The servant spoke softly, still smiling but with a mocking tone.

“Huh?”

“Damn it! These bastards even took advantage of me. It’s been a while since I needed to be taught a lesson!” Lo Tian gritted his teeth. Seeing the servant’s face turning cold, and several burly men approaching.

“G-give…” Lo Tian sighed longingly. He could afford twenty-one thousand spirit stones, of course.

He waved his hand, handing the servant a storage pouch with exactly twenty-one thousand spirit stones.

“Haha! Guest, please go. Welcome back!” The servant smiled again upon receiving the pouch, and the fierce men retreated.

“Damn it! A meal cost twenty-one thousand spirit stones!” Lo Tian’s heart bled. Even with spirit stones, he didn’t spend like this.

“How are you?” Cen Weihong saw Lo Tian’s grim face and asked.

“Nothing, nothing. Brother, it's just fun! This is how we strengthen our bond. I often trick them too. Take Sun Kelian for example; I once left him with nothing but his pants!” Lo Tian chuckled, trying to maintain a high image in Cen Weihong’s eyes. He recounted his past glories.

“Ah-choo…” Sun Kelian sat in the room, sneezing. His ears turned red.

“Damn it! Who’s talking about me?” Sun Kelian muttered, looking at the simple room.

“Fatass, what are you muttering?” Zhang Jinghuan asked upon hearing Sun Kelian.

“Nothing. I just have a bad feeling, thinking you’ll get into trouble!” Sun Kelian shouted.

“Fatass, don’t play tricks. You can’t run away! What’s there to get into trouble about? Believe me, I’ll rip your mouth apart!” Zhang Jinghuan’s face showed contempt.

“Smack…” As Zhang Jinghuan’s words finished, the courtyard door was kicked open. A group of men in blue robes stepped in.

“Where are they? Come out!” A cold voice echoed through the courtyard. Several figures stood there, exuding a killing aura—clearly at the late Tianxian (Celestial Immortal) stage.

“Hmph.” Upon hearing the cold voice, Xuan Dan, Zhang Jinghuan, and Du Chengshi frowned slightly. They stepped out of the room, while Ke Zhenghao and Duan Chengfeng also came out with confusion.

“Huantian Island?” The six saw their attire and recognized the faction.

“You, do you know this person?” A tall man looked at Xuan Dan and nodded. He waved his hand, sending a portrait to their front.

“What is this?” Upon seeing the portrait, Xuan Dan and his group were slightly startled but kept their faces neutral, showing confusion.

“Sorry, don’t know!” Xuan Dan smiled and replied.

“Hmph. Then we’ll take our leave. If you find this person, please inform us of Huantian Island. We’ll definitely reward you!” The tall man nodded, speaking more politely now that Xuan Dan was a senior immortal.

“Sure! Sure. However, sir, what crime did this person commit? Why is it so important to you?” Xuan Dan showed interest, asking.

“Causing trouble on Huantian Island, disrupting the auction. Killing a few of our people!” The tall man replied and then left.

Xuan Dan’s face darkened. He watched the men leave, then exchanged glances with Zhang Jinghuan and others before entering the room.

“What’s wrong? Is this fool crazy for causing trouble in Huantian City?” As soon as they entered, Zhang Jinghuan’s face turned fierce. He knew causing trouble on Huantian Island would have consequences, possibly dragging them along.

“Why are you so anxious!” Xuan Dan scolded, his eyes cold.

“Haha! I felt something was wrong earlier. You’ll get into trouble!” Sun Kelian shouted, his voice filled with joy.

“Liar! I’ll rip your mouth apart!” Hearing Sun Kelian’s words, Zhang Jinghuan’s face turned fierce. He raised his hand to slap Sun Kelian.

“What are you doing?” Xuan Dan immediately stopped Zhang Jinghuan, his eyes showing dissatisfaction.

“Now, we must find the two children and leave Huantian Island immediately. Once this storm passes, we’ll return!” Xuan Dan spoke urgently.

“Master Xuan, I’m back!” As Xuan Dan was about to speak again, Tian Hongyun’s voice echoed from outside the courtyard.

“Come in!” Xuan Dan immediately let Tian Hongyun into the room but didn’t notice Lo Tian and Cen Weihong’s absence, casting a shadow over his mind.

“Where are they?” Xuan Dan asked Tian Hongyun sternly, his voice authoritative. He was truly worried.

“They were walking together, then saw people confronting on the street. Lo Senior insisted on checking it out, and…” Tian Hongyun trembled as he recounted the events to Xuan Dan and others, but omitted details about Lo Tian.

“This fool is always causing trouble. Every time there’s an incident, he’s involved! Last time at the Chaos Heaven Gate too!” Zhang Jinghuan showed killing intent, speaking harshly.

“Enough. You stay here. I’ll go find them and leave immediately once they’re found!” Xuan Dan sighed softly, then stepped out of the room.

……

“Damn it! This caused such a big commotion?” As Lo Tian and Cen Weihong stepped out of the inn, they saw people walking along Huantian Island’s streets.

The islanders were discussing the incident, leaving Lo Tian and Cen Weihong stunned.

“Did you hear? Eight guards were killed by people—six dead, two still unconscious. They say over a thousand people surrounded them. When did Huantian Island suffer such a loss? The culprit will probably be flayed!” Lo Tian overheard the murmurs, his face sweating. He hadn’t expected it to result in deaths.

“Huantian Island will definitely dismantle the culprit. If you provide clues, they’ll let you live here for a month!”

“If you help catch the culprit, Huantian Island will accept him as their member!” People kept discussing the sky-high reward for Lo Tian.

Being accepted by Huantian Island was an irresistible temptation. If one joined, no one in the Lower Three Heavens, including three sects, would dare to provoke them. Even Middle Three Heavens’ sects would show respect due to Huantian Island’s backing from Bountiful Heaven Mountain.

“Damn it!” Lo Tian instinctively touched his Thousand Mirage Mask, fearing recognition. He thought the matter would pass unnoticed, that Huantian Island wouldn’t investigate deeply since it was a crowd. But if they did, he would be discovered.

“Fool! Why did you cause such a big mess!” As Lo Tian planned to return, Xuan Dan’s voice echoed in his mind.

Chapter 1890: Reencountering Fang Zhengyang

Lo Tian’s face turned red. He saw Xuan Dan striding toward him and Cen Weihong.

“Senior…” Lo Tian chuckled awkwardly. Xuan Dan wouldn’t recognize him, as Cen Weihong stood beside him.

“Let’s go back. Hurry up and leave. Though I don’t know how you changed your appearance, it won’t last long!” Xuan Dan sighed. If discovered, even he couldn’t protect Lo Tian; they’d have to fight hard, but fighting Huantian Island was suicide.

“Hmph.” Lo Tian felt the situation had escalated. If caught, he might be left behind and torn apart.

The three didn’t speak further but headed to their rented courtyard. However, after a few steps, an old man with a smile appeared before them, blocking their path.

“Is this Master Xuan Dan?” The old man wore a blue robe with the character “Huantian” on his sleeve, clearly a Huantian Island resident.

What surprised Lo Tian was that he recognized this old man. He hadn’t expected to meet him on Huantian Island.

Fang Zhengyang, the manager of the gambling stone shop in Chaos Heaven City. He had once helped Lo Tian return Long Youran to the Heavenly Gate.

“Lo Tian, you’ve hidden well!” Fang Zhengyang spoke to Xuan Dan first, then looked at Lo Tian with a smile, making Lo Tian’s and Xuan Dan’s and Cen Weihong’s faces grim.

“How did you recognize me?” Lo Tian kept his face neutral, asking Fang Zhengyang.

“I suppose it’s easy to find you!” Fang Zhengyang smiled in reply.

“Lo Tian, don’t worry. I have no ill intent. You remember the favor we owed you? We’ve repaid it, but your help still remains!” Fang Zhengyang didn’t wait for Lo Tian to speak and continued.

“Master Xuan Dan is here too. I know you’re in trouble. Help my master, and your troubles will be resolved!” Fang Zhengyang stood before the three, looking at Lo Tian.

“Unexpectedly, the gambling stone shop in Chaos Heaven City is run by Huantian Island. That’s why Guan Hongsheng dared not touch it. And the shop is so rich!” Lo Tian realized.

“Do you know, Master Fang, what favor I must do?” Lo Tian furrowed his brow. He sensed Fang Zhengyang’s master was of high status, and this favor might not be easy.

“Just see for yourself!” Fang Zhengyang shook his head gently. He turned and led them toward Huantian Island’s center without waiting for their agreement, knowing they had no choice.

“Let’s go see!” Xuan Dan spoke softly. Since trouble was already caused, they’d try other solutions.

“Apologies, Senior, for causing you more trouble!” Lo Tian showed regret. Xuan Dan had already helped him too much.

“What are you talking about? Who else but me is your senior!” Xuan Dan patted Lo Tian’s head, then followed Fang Zhengyang.

On the street, people came and went. Occasionally, those in Huantian Island attire searched through the crowd, scanning passersby.

When their eyes fell on Lo Tian and his group, they avoided looking directly—Fang Zhengyang’s Huantian Island attire was the best proof.

Not long after, Fang Zhengyang led Lo Tian and his group to a grand courtyard. The courtyard was luxurious; even its decorations were carved from special minerals. The most noticeable feature was the ground, entirely paved with spirit stones, sparkling and filled with spiritual energy.

“Truly rich…” Lo Tian marveled silently. He followed Fang Zhengyang, observing the surroundings. Servants gathered in groups, yet each carried an aura that wasn’t weak.

“Who is it? Who has such status!” Lo Tian was curious, as was Xuan Dan’s face showing surprise.

Not long after, Fang Zhengyang led them to a seemingly ordinary door. Ordinary compared to the courtyard’s houses.

“Master, Lo Tian has arrived, as well as Master Xuan!” Fang Zhengyang bowed respectfully and knocked on the door.

“Hmph. Let them wait outside for a moment. I’ll come out shortly!” A calm voice echoed from within, then silence followed.

“Understood.” Fang Zhengyang bowed slightly and guided Lo Tian to a jade table, instructing the servant to serve tea.

“Master Fang, now can we know what favor we must do?” Lo Tian furrowed his brow, unsure.

“Alas…”

“Three, have you seen all these spirit stones? Honestly, my master isn’t a showy person. But he must rely on these spirit stones!”

“These spirit stones are what my master needs to absorb today. He requires vast spiritual energy to suppress a strange illness within his body…” Fang Zhengyang’s eyes carried a smile.

“…?”

“Master Fang, are you asking me to use my Dragon Eye Crystal to replace these spirit stones?” Lo Tian furrowed his brow.

“Exactly. These years, our gambling stone shop has collected many spirit crystals and rare ones. But we’ve never found a Dragon Eye Crystal. The higher the quality of the spirit crystal, the better it is for my master’s illness. These years, he spent countless resources to control his condition!” Fang Zhengyang spoke.

“Creak…” As Fang Zhengyang’s words ended, the door opened. A tall young man stepped out.

Dressed in white, his long hair was tied up. His body was thin, with a pale face but sharp eyes.

“Master Xuan Dan, Brother Lo Tian. I’ve heard of your names. Welcome!” The young man spoke softly, his voice weak. He looked like a sickly scholar.

“Ah! I’ve finally met the master himself!” Lo Tian bowed, addressing the young man.

“My name is Jiang Yuzhe. I heard Brother Lo has a Dragon Eye Crystal and wish to borrow it!” The young man got straight to the point, revealing his intention.

“However, I’ll need it for a while. Please let me borrow it—shortly half a month, up to a month! I’ll definitely return it!” Jiang Yuzhe looked at Lo Tian.

“Hmph. I had already promised Brother Jiang, the Dragon Eye Crystal will definitely be lent to you!”

“But Brother Jiang, I estimate your illness can’t be cured by the Dragon Eye Crystal!” Lo Tian waved his hand, two radiant crystals appearing in his hands. Vast spiritual energy radiated from the Dragon Eye Crystals.

Jiang Yuzhe inhaled deeply. His pale face slightly reddened, his eyes glowing with light.

“Brother Lo, can you determine my illness?” Jiang Yuzhe’s eyes sparkled. His expression and Fang Zhengyang and Xuan Dan’s faces showed surprise—Lo Tian had detected Jiang Yuzhe’s illness.

Since Jiang Yuzhe appeared, Xuan Dan had observed him but hadn’t found his problem.

“I only suspect it. To confirm, I must examine it carefully!” Lo Tian shook his head gently. He had learned medicine from Du Hongyu; medicine requires observation, listening, questioning, and palpation. Lo Tian had only noticed Jiang Yuzhe’s weakness but sensed a powerful force within his body.

“Then let Brother Lo examine it!” Jiang Yuzhe smiled, eager to have Lo Tian check.

“Alright.” Jiang Yuzhe didn’t refuse. Though he knew Lo Tian wouldn’t find much, he gave him the courtesy.

Lo Tian placed his hand on Jiang Yuzhe’s wrist. This made Fang Zhengyang’s face tense—his master was strong, but Lo Tian had placed his hand on Jiang Yuzhe’s life gate.

Under the eyes of the three, Lo Tian closed his eyes and listened carefully. He also used his spiritual sense to examine Jiang Yuzhe’s condition.

“This kid has talent. He cured Left Qiuyu’s poison!” Xuan Dan smiled, hoping Lo Tian could heal Jiang Yuzhe. Clearly, Jiang Yuzhe’s status was high; if he could gain a favor from him, it would be a great gain for Lo Tian.

Lo Tian closed his eyes. Sometimes he furrowed his brows, sometimes he relaxed. After a quarter of an hour, Lo Tian finally opened his eyes.

“Brother Jiang, if I’m not mistaken, you were bitten by a ghost!” Lo Tian opened his eyes and spoke directly. Xuan Dan was stunned.

“Exactly, you were bitten by a ghost. If not for someone’s strength helping you, you wouldn’t have lived past ten years! Even now, you must rely on vast spiritual energy daily to suppress the ghostly aura left by that ghost!” Lo Tian spoke again.

“Damn kid! You’re lying!” Xuan Dan slapped Lo Tian’s head. Jiang Yuzhe was such a high status—his parents would never let him be near a ghost.

“Brother Lo, you are truly a master!” However, as Xuan Dan’s words finished, Jiang Yuzhe’s face showed joy and he spoke loudly.

“Brother Lo, is there a way to heal it?” Jiang Yuzhe looked at Lo Tian with hope.

“Yes, but it’s a bit complicated. You need to prepare some things. I have a fifty percent chance of success!”

“Doctors are like parents; I’ll do my best. But whether it succeeds or not, it’s up to fate!” Lo Tian nodded solemnly. If Nan Gong Yuqing and others heard this, they’d know someone was about to have bad luck.

Chapter 1891: Traitor

“Brother Lo! If you can heal my body, I Jiang Yuzhe will definitely repay you generously!” Jiang Yuzhe’s eyes showed excitement. He hadn’t expected Lo Tian to be able to heal the thing within his body.

“Hmph. Don’t worry, Brother Jiang. I have a habit of not letting people be sick!”

“But I need to go to the Middle Three Heavens. Short of a month, long of two months. I’ll return when you’ve prepared everything!” Lo Tian smiled and spoke to Jiang Yuzhe.

“Hmph. Brother Lo, don’t worry. Half a month, I’ll definitely have everything ready. This token, Brother Lo, take it. If you encounter any trouble, show it to anyone and they’ll give you face!” Jiang Yuzhe took out a token.

The token was like jade. Two bold characters were carved on it, radiating an ancient aura. The material of the token was definitely a rare treasure.

“Bountiful Heaven Seal!” Xuan Dan’s eyes showed shock. He looked at the two bold characters on the token and spoke in disbelief.

“Master Xuan Dan, do you know this token?” Jiang Yuzhe’s eyes showed surprise. He looked at Xuan Dan.

“Fool! Who isn’t blind? The token says Bountiful Heaven. Who doesn’t know the characters?” Lo Tian thought to himself, but also curious about what was special about the Bountiful Heaven Seal. Its name alone suggested it related to Bountiful Heaven Mountain.

“Unexpectedly, Brother Jiang’s status is so noble! I’ve heard that Bountiful Heaven Mountain has nine Bountiful Heaven Seals, forged by the Bountiful Heaven Immortal King with astonishing techniques.” Xuan Dan’s eyes showed admiration.

“Haha. What noble or not noble—just a sickly person!” Jiang Yuzhe shook his head gently.
