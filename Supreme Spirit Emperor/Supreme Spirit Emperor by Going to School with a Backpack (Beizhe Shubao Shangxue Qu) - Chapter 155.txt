“Jiang Sici has won a round!” Those who had bet on Jiang Sici to win looked with renewed vigor, their gazes turning toward Zhao Tianming.

Sun Shaoshan, however, seemed oblivious, exchanging a glance with Kong Mingzi before giving a slight nod.

“I’ll take it,” said Kong Mingzi, stepping onto the Blue Dragon Arena. At that moment, his usually calm expression seemed to transform entirely; a sinister aura radiated from him, as if he were a demon emerging from hell.

Unconsciously, the crowd turned their eyes toward Xie Naiyang. At this point, Jiang Sici’s side had only Luotian and Xie Naiyang left. None expected Luotian, a mere attendant, to defeat Kong Mingzi—within their hearts, Luotian was already dead.

“Go,” Jiang Sici smiled slightly, her jade-like fingers lightly tapping before finally landing on Luotian.

Chapter 750: Tensions Escalate

Chapter 750: Tensions Escalate

“What?” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples looked in shock toward Luotian, whom Jiang Sici had pointed to. None could fathom why she would send him into battle.

Luotian’s body trembled, his eyes flickering with contemplation before darkening. Jiang Sici’s move was clearly pushing him toward death.

Even with his confidence, Luotian had no assurance of victory against the terrifying Kong Mingzi.

Li Naiyang’s body hesitated slightly; he had already prepared to step forward but withdrew his foot, his gaze thoughtful.

“Hah!” Sun Shaowen’s face lit up with amusement as he grasped Jiang Sici’s intent.

If Luotian faced Kong Mingzi, he would surely lose. But if Li Naiyang fought against Jin Wuming, he would certainly win. With a two-out-of-three match, Jiang Sici’s side would triumph—sacrificing only Luotian.

“Kid, your master has discarded you as cannon fodder! Did you really think yourself important? Remember, you’re just an attendant. Think your skills make your master look at you differently?” Sun Shaowen sneered, his face brimming with mockery.

Others weren’t blind; after some speculation, they understood Jiang Sici’s plan. Their gazes turned even more pitying.

“Are you sure you want me to fight?” Luotian’s eyes darkened, his gaze sharp as he looked at Jiang Sici.

“It was the only way. If you die, I’ll avenge you. If you win, from now on, you shall be my first attendant—second only to me!” Jiang Sici’s eyes flickered with a tremor at Luotian’s icy gaze, but she soon let out a light laugh.

“Fine, but I have one demand: delay the match to three days from now.” Luotian spoke solemnly, his gaze resolute as he looked at Jiang Sici.

At first, Jiang Sici had seemed decent to Luotian, but now she was merely a stranger. To die for her, he couldn’t do it.

In truth, Luotian didn’t blame Jiang Sici too much; after all, he was just an attendant, a half-source supreme. Li Naiyang, however, was a one-source supreme—his status, strength, and background all surpassed Luotian’s. Any rational person would abandon him to let Li Naiyang clash with Kong Mingzi. But Luotian was furious, deeply so. Thus, he intended to make a stunning debut.

Jiang Sici’s face darkened at Luotian’s resolute and icy gaze; this was the first time a servant had dared to bargain with her.

They stared at each other for a long while. Perhaps Jiang Sici felt remorse, or perhaps she saw Luotian as a doomed man—better to let him live three more days.

“Fine. If you have any unfinished wishes, I can help fulfill them,” Jiang Sici nodded gently, her demeanor still calm. She turned to Sun Shaohui.

“Let the life-or-death match be scheduled for three days from now.” Jiang Sici’s voice was imperious as she cast a faint glance at Sun Shaohui.

“Uh… okay.” Sun Shaohui, seeing Jiang Sici’s displeasure, nodded slightly. For cultivators, three days were but a blink of an eye. Moreover, the outcome seemed already decided—Sun Shaohui would surely lose.

“Kid, let you live three more days. Three days—watch me kill you myself!” Sun Shaowen’s face twisted with menace, his gaze cold as he stared at Luotian.

“Tiresome—have to wait three days!” The crowd’s faces bore disappointment, their gazes toward Luotian laced with resentment. Especially those who had bet on Jiang Sici’s victory, they had expected to collect their winnings today but now had to wait three more days.

Sima Qiong’s lips twitched as he recalled the bet, calculating how much he would have to pay. His face bore a pained expression.

“Hey, can I still place another bet?” Luotian’s voice echoed in Sima Qiong’s ears, making him glare with fury.

“Go to hell… the result is already decided. Why bet now? Think I’m too kind?” Sima Qiong spoke, wanting to see who dared provoke him when his mood was foul.

“I didn’t mean that. Don’t you have any interest in placing a separate bet on who will win?” Luotian smiled at Sima Qiong.

“What? This kid’s head must’ve been hit by a door—daring to let Sima Senior continue the betting?” The surrounding disciples looked at Luotian with mockery.

Hearing Luotian’s words, Sima Qiong’s eyes flickered with thought before he nodded slightly. “Hmph, well, it’s better to recover some money. Come on, this kid—bet one thousand yuan energy stones for Kong Mingzi, and zero point zero zero one for Luotian. Anyone who wants to bet can come over and place their wager!”

Sima Qiong spoke listlessly, his mind already calculating how to find a fool to bet on Luotian so he could recoup some of his losses.

“Bet all on my victory!” Luotian waved his hand, and several storage bags landed on Sima Qiong’s table.

“Huh?” Sima Qiong’s eyes brightened as he grabbed Luotian’s storage bags, his face showing surprise before a grin.

“A good man! Truly a good man!” Sima Qiong was overjoyed, handing Luotian the ticket.

“Kid, you can name any wish— I’ll fulfill it. If there’s anyone you need to care for, I can also arrange their safety!” Sima Qiong’s face was almost beaming.

The crowd, seeing Sima Qiong’s unusual behavior, looked puzzled. But when they saw the amount on Luotian’s ticket, their faces turned shocked.

“Ten billion yuan energy stones!” One sharp-eyed person shouted out, stunned that an attendant could be so wealthy.

Ten billion yuan energy stones—such a sum was beyond the reach of ordinary people even on the Blue Dragon Continent.

“Unexpectedly, a sect cultivator is so rich. Sima Senior truly has good luck; he’s even recouped today’s losses!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples murmured, their faces filled with envy.

“No, I just hope it’s paid out to me,” Luotian said without the slightest hesitation, a smile on his face as he walked out of the crowd, not even greeting Jiang Sici.

Jiang Sici sighed deeply; she knew that with her decision, a deep rift had formed between them. Luotian would never again wholeheartedly help her.

Luotian’s face was dark, his steps unhesitating as he flew out of the Blue Dragon Sect. As an attendant, he could freely enter and exit the sect—thanks to the Binding Spirit Band. Even if he escaped the Blue Dragon Continent, a single thought from the sect would bring him back.

Luotian soared through the sky, becoming a streak of light that exited the Blue Dragon Continent. His destination was the Black Rock Continent.

Luotian knew he had no chance against Kong Mingzi, but he had his own confidence: his shadow clone. After days of cultivation and absorption, the clone had reached the Supreme Stage and even grasped the Space Dao, which thrilled Luotian.

“Unbeatable within one’s rank? I’ll see how you manage that when I reach the One Source Supreme!” Luotian flew through the void, his lips curling with coldness as he displayed an unyielding spirit.

Meanwhile, Luotian’s clone finally emerged cautiously from the Black Rock Continent, a smile on its face. It felt that the surface of the continent was constantly being scoured by people, as if searching for something. The clone’s aura was masked to the utmost, carefully exiting the Black Rock Continent.

In the void, flashes of light danced; two beams converged toward a single point. Though in the void, some cultivators still dared to venture there—Luotian’s presence wasn’t entirely strange.

“Ten thousand miles… one thousand miles… one hundred miles…” After half a day of flight, Luotian and his clone finally converged on an unassuming small continent.

The original and the clone exchanged a smile, their hands moving swiftly to conjure countless seals. A gray barrier enveloped the small planet.

“Though I haven’t grasped the Fire Dao, mastering the Space Dao is enough. Time is pressing—only by reaching the Supreme Stage can I solidify my position within the Blue Dragon Sect. This Four Sacred Continents is no match for Tianyuan Continent; Luotian knows that regardless of which continent he’s on, he must rely solely on himself. Only with strength can one truly be powerful—otherwise, one becomes a discarded pawn.”

With that thought, Luotian’s eyes showed no hesitation as his original and clone merged.

“Boom…” A deep thunderous sound echoed, the already dim void swirling with gray energy.

Luotian’s face bore a calm expression as he sat cross-legged on the star, his lips slightly upturned. His aura surged rapidly.

The path was clear; after so much accumulation, becoming a Supreme Stage was inevitable. Within just half a day, his aura reached its peak.

Slowly standing up, the land beneath him trembled as if submitting to a subject.

“Crack…” A streak of gray lightning shot through the void, like a rift in space, instantly striking Luotian.

“Hmph!” Luotian sneered, snatching the lightning—manifested from chaotic power—and ignoring its terrifying destructive force.

“Crush!” Luotian smiled, his fingers curling slightly as the powerful gray lightning shattered into chaotic energy, seeping into Luotian’s body.

“Today is the day I ascend to Supreme!” Luotian roared into the sky, his underfoot land shattering into countless fragments that scattered into the void.

“Hmph? Someone has reached the Supreme Stage?” A man several thousand miles away, his gaze deep and contemplative, looked toward Luotian’s direction. On his forehead was a fierce white tiger tattoo, sending chills down the spine of those who saw it.

Chapter 751: The Pursuit from the White Tiger Continent

Chapter 751: The Pursuit from the White Tiger Continent

In the Four Sacred Continents, Luotian stood proudly in the void. The surrounding celestial forces formed waves of energy that surged into his body, making him feel like the master of this void.

An hour passed; the thunderous sounds within Luotian’s body gradually subsided, and his nine meridians glowed faintly before calming.

“One Source Supreme!” Luotian smiled, his confidence bolstered by the Space Dao. He felt as if he could go anywhere within this space with but a thought—paired with the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven, his speed rivaled teleportation.

“Kid, I didn’t expect you to dare appear! Killing my White Tiger Continent’s people and then boldly breaking through—this is the first time!” A voice suddenly echoed, making Luotian’s gaze tighten.

His spiritual sense expanded outward, revealing a young man with an icy smile approaching him.

“Two Source Supreme?” Luotian’s brows furrowed; he hadn’t expected to be found so quickly by the White Tiger Continent.

“Good, I’ve just reached One Source Supreme—perfect for testing against a Two Source Supreme. Let’s see how much I differ from you!” Luotian muttered, his face confident.

Though he knew that each level of Supreme Stage was vastly different, Luotian trusted his mastery of the Space Dao and Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven. He could escape even a Two Source Supreme.

“Intelligence said it was a half-source supreme kid who killed my White Tiger Continent’s people. I didn’t expect him to break through so quickly into One Source Supreme—seems like a genius!” The man materialized a few hundred feet away, his body glowing red.

“Blue Dragon Sect!” Seeing the headband on Luotian’s head, the young man looked surprised. Naturally, he knew about the Binding Spirit Band of the Blue Dragon Sect.

“Truly embarrassing—killed by a mere attendant of the Blue Dragon Sect!” The man muttered, as if ignoring Luotian. Yet his body transformed into a sea of fire, swirling toward Luotian.

The red firestorm seemed to burn through the void itself; its terrifying temperature melted the scattered debris around Luotian, making his brows furrow.

“Two Source Supreme is truly terrifying! Just this temperature is beyond my endurance!” His body conjured the Jade Crystal Luminous Fire, forming a green fire dragon that rushed toward the man’s firestorm.

“Ah! That’s ancestral fire—unbelievable, you still have such a rare treasure!” The man in the firestorm looked at the green flame with intense greed.

Having mastered the Fire Dao, he was irresistibly drawn to this rare treasure of the world—his desire to kill Luotian had now gone beyond merely avenging his White Tiger Sect.

With that thought, the man no longer hesitated to give Luotian a chance; his body flashed forward and appeared before Luotian, the overwhelming aura of a Two Source Supreme pressing down on him.

“Boom…” Luotian showed no fear, his Mie Sheng Fist striking instantly and colliding with the man’s red fist.

A terrifying wave formed between their collision, shaking the lifeless continent around them as if it might collapse.

One strike and retreat—Luotian knew he wasn’t the man’s match yet, his body humming with a ringing sound before vanishing entirely, leaving only a shadow.

“Space Dao!” The man’s face showed shock at Luotian’s speed, which had reached its peak. He hadn’t expected Luotian to master the Space Dao—far more advanced than his Fire Dao.

The man’s momentary hesitation allowed Luotian to vanish like teleportation, appearing thousands of miles away. The Black Void separated him from the Blue Dragon Continent.

“Such speed, it’s delightful!” Luotian smiled with excitement, his gaze toward the Black Void-wrapped Blue Dragon Continent. He stepped on the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven, appearing above the Blue Dragon Continent.

“Such speed—even a Three Source Supreme would find it hard to kill me! The Space Dao truly is one of the great Dao!” Luotian muttered, flying toward the Blue Dragon Sect.

“You damned fool! The Blue Dragon Sect thinks the Four Sacred Continents belong to them? A mere attendant killed one of our White Tiger Sect’s disciples! How do you plan to explain this to us?” The man stood outside the Blue Dragon Continent, his face dark as he spoke. He knew that even though he could suppress Luotian, the latter would escape if he wanted to.

At this moment, on the Blue Dragon Arena, the three-day deadline set by Jiang Sici and Sun Shaohui had arrived. The Blue Dragon Arena was packed with people, all eyes filled with anticipation as they looked toward Kong Mingzi standing before Sun Shaohui.

Kong Mingzi, now at such a high status, didn’t need to participate in the Blue Dragon Arena. For years, people rarely saw him fight. Now that the reigning champion of the Blue Dragon Arena was fighting again, it stirred excitement among the crowd.

“Jiang Senior, is your attendant hiding? Come out quickly—today is the day!” Sun Shaowen’s face twisted with a sinister grin as he addressed Jiang Sici.

“Smack!” Before Sun Shaowen could speak, a clear slap echoed in the crowd.

“You’re what? Dare to talk like that to me? If you keep shouting, your life might vanish without notice!” Jiang Sici’s cold voice echoed in the crowd. Even with Sun Shaowen’s half-source supreme strength, his face was slapped high.

“Crack…” The ground beneath Sun Shaohui cracked as his aura gradually rose.

“Damn woman, I’ll eventually have you under me!” Sun Shaohui seethed internally. He pulled Sun Shaowen forward to heal his injuries.

“Boom…” Kong Mingzi’s figure stood on the Blue Dragon Arena, his face glowing with bloodlust as he gazed at Jiang Sici and others.

“Senior Sima, are you still accepting bets?” Zhang Qingsheng, his face slightly timid, approached Sima Qiong.

“Huh?” Hearing someone wanted to bet, Sima Qiong’s eyes flashed with excitement as he looked at Zhang Qingsheng.

Seeing that Zhang Qingsheng also wore the golden Binding Spirit Band, Sima Qiong showed no contempt and asked: “Who do you bet on?”

“I bet on Luotian!” Zhang Qingsheng spoke softly, causing a commotion among the crowd.

“Haha, I heard Zhang Qingsheng is close to Luotian—unbelievable they’re both fools!” The surrounding attendants laughed without restraint.

“Bet on Luotian? Good, good!” Sima Qiong was delighted; though he knew Zhang Qingsheng was an attendant, he might not have much money. But Sima Qiong had a saying: even a fly’s leg is meat.

“Five thousand yuan energy stones!” Zhang Qingsheng handed a storage bag to Sima Qiong, waiting for him to inspect it.

“Tsk tsk, five thousand! Senior Sima has made a profit again!” The disciples around him looked with envy.

Sima Qiong smiled, handing Zhang Qingsheng the ticket and patting his shoulder: “Kid, I like you. If anyone bullies you, just come to me—no, from now on, follow me. I’m sure Jiang Senior won’t mind.” Sima Qiong addressed Jiang Sici.

Luotian and Jiang Sici both abandoned each other, let alone a soul-attunement peak Zhang Qingsheng. In Jiang Sici’s eyes, exchanging a soul-attunement peak attendant for Sima Qiong’s favor was worth it.

“Buzz…” A ripple spread as Luotian appeared outside the crowd, making the Blue Dragon Sect disciples stunned.

“He’s here!” The people murmured quietly, as if seeing a weak youth being torn apart.

“You really dared to come! But you can’t escape anyway!” Kong Mingzi’s lips curled slightly, his gaze like a lone wolf watching its prey.

The soul-attuning jade on his waist glowed, and Luotian soared onto the Blue Dragon Arena. His face bore a smile as he looked at Kong Mingzi.

“Many people want to kill me, but I’m still alive—so are you!” Luotian coldly replied, his aura sending shivers through the crowd.

“Three days to reach One Source Supreme!” Sensing Luotian’s aura, Kong Mingzi’s face shifted slightly before a grin spread across it.

“This is more fun! One Source Supreme—killing you is more enjoyable. Otherwise, how can I live up to my title of unbeatable within one’s rank?” Kong Mingzi’s eyes gleamed with bloodlust, his lips licking the fresh red.

“Three days to reach One Source Supreme—this Luotian isn’t simple at all! At least, he’s a genius. Unfortunately, he met Kong Mingzi; if given more time to grow, he would’ve been among the strongest attendants of the Blue Dragon Sect!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples murmured, their expressions filled with admiration before excitement.

“Unbeatable within one’s rank? With me here, you don’t deserve that title!” Luotian sneered, his nine-colored meridians glowing as he took a step forward and struck Kong Mingzi with a punch.

“Die!” Seeing Luotian’s bold move, Kong Mingzi’s face turned cold; his aura surged as he met Luotian’s punch head-on.

“Crack…” The reinforced Blue Dragon Arena space cracked, bricks lifting as Luotian stood still while Kong Mingzi was pushed back, his face filled with shock.

Chapter 752: The Debt of Gambling

Chapter 752: The Debt of Gambling

In the Blue Dragon Sect’s Blue Dragon Arena, Kong Mingzi’s face was shocked as he flew backward, his golden fist crackling.

“One punch—Kong Mingzi was knocked back! This Luotian is truly strong!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples murmured, their faces filled with shock.

Even Jiang Sici’s face showed disbelief; she hadn’t expected the so-called unbeatable within one’s rank, Kong Mingzi, to be knocked back by Luotian.

“Interesting!” Kong Mingzi’s eyes flickered with shock before returning to a grin, though his gaze was colder.

“Kill!” The next moment, Kong Mingzi surged forward like a provoked beast, his body turning into golden light toward Luotian.

“Wind-Fire Dragon Kill!” Kong Mingzi roared, his arms filled with energy; one arm transformed into a fire attribute dragon, the other into a wind attribute dragon. Together, they surged with overwhelming power, using fire to enhance wind as they attacked Luotian.

A powerful aura formed on Kong Mingzi’s arms, the two dragons roaring as if real; where they passed, even the reinforced arena ground cracked.

“This is Kong Mingzi’s Wind-Fire Dragon Kill—unbelievable, he used it so early!” Sun Shaohui frowned slightly, his face showing surprise.

“Damn!” Sun Shaowen’s face darkened to the core, his eyes filled with resentment. He had already decided Luotian would die, but now he was stunned by his strength—Kong Mingzi had even been knocked back.

Seeing Kong Mingzi’s thick arms rushing toward him, Luotian felt a surge of danger. Yet his face remained cold; he met Kong Mingzi’s powerful attack without fear, his left hand summoning the Wheel of轮回 and his right hand the Mie Sheng Fist.

In the crowd’s shock, the two dragons collided with Luotian’s fists, creating a thunderous explosion. The sound was so loud it shook the heavens and earth; as they collided, Kong Mingzi’s voice echoed again as he was pushed back further, his injuries worse than before. Blood dripped onto the arena floor, making the entire Blue Dragon Arena silent. The crowd stared at Luotian, who stood calmly and composed.

Kong Mingzi stood still, his face dark with fury; his bloodshot eyes gazed at Luotian’s calm demeanor, filled with murderous intent.

“Say it again—what makes you unbeatable within one’s rank?” Luotian rubbed his slightly numb fist, his voice calm.

Since arriving in the Four Sacred Continents, Luotian had been stifled; he needed a strong opponent to vent his frustration—frustration from being sealed in the Tianyuan Continent, from being discarded by Jiang Sici, and from being forcibly made an attendant by the Blue Dragon Sect elders.

Luotian’s cold voice snapped the crowd back to reality; they fell silent, their gazes now toward Luotian—not as a servant but with respect.

“You dare to die!” Kong Mingzi glared at Luotian’s lofty gaze, his eyes filled with madness.

On the Blue Dragon Arena, he was the king—no one could replace him. Kong Mingzi had never felt so embarrassed before, especially with Luotian’s tone that made him explode.

Kong Mingzi laughed, his laughter sinister and echoing across the Blue Dragon Arena. He slowly stood up, his head raised as his grin turned colder.

“For these years, you are the first one to make me look so foolish on the Blue Dragon Arena. This arena belongs to me, Kong Mingzi!” Kong Mingzi roared, his entire body turning red. His hands formed a seal, and behind him, fire surged upward, the One Source Supreme’s power fully unleashed. A red beast head formed, roaring toward Luotian as if to devour him.

“Don’t even know the Fire Dao—dare to harm me? Playing with fire, you’re still far from it!” Luotian sneered, his hand slapping the air. A green fire dragon surged upward, its terrifying temperature instantly burning the entire Blue Dragon Arena.

“Fen Tian Li Huo Array!” Luotian struck his palm, fire spreading everywhere. Countless fire dragons surrounded the beast head Kong Mingzi conjured.

“Roar…” The roar echoed through the sky; people could almost feel Kong Mingzi’s real-world martial art. The desperate scream was heard.

“Ancestral Fire! That’s ancestral fire—this world’s rare treasure! Unbelievable, Luotian has such a blessing!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples recognized it immediately. Seeing the terrifying power of the Jade Crystal Luminous Fire, they knew it was ancestral fire.

Greed flickered in Sun Shaohui’s eyes; even he coveted it. Anything that could quickly grasp the essence of fire was desired by all.

With a thunderous explosion, Luotian’s Jade Crystal Luminous Fire crushed the red beast head. It finally became a palm-sized flame, returning to Luotian’s dantian.

“It’s my turn!” Luotian roared, his foot stepping on the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven. He vanished like teleportation and appeared before Kong Mingzi, striking with a punch.

Too fast—Luotian’s speed had reached its peak. Kong Mingzi felt a sharp pain in his chest and was pushed back.

Kong Mingzi, the reigning champion of the Blue Dragon Arena, wasn’t a fool; even so, he pushed back while raising a green wind attribute barrier in front of himself.

“Crack…” The barrier formed quickly but shattered just as fast. Kong Mingzi felt a sharp sound in his ears; the barrier he had just created was destroyed by Luotian’s next punch.

At the same time, Luotian’s third punch was already approaching, striking Kong Mingzi’s body.

“One… two…” Luotian delivered six punches before stopping, standing atop the sky with a cold expression.

Kong Mingzi’s entire body was stained with blood, his face pale but still alive.

“Bengshan Quan!” Luotian didn’t want to give Kong Mingzi any chance to recover. His hand waved, and a golden mountain sliced through the void with immense pressure.

A streak of chaotic energy shot from Luotian’s hand, entering the golden mountain and making it tremble three times. The mountain body was as real as stone.

“You dare! If you kill him, you’ll never live long!” Sun Shaohui looked at Kong Mingzi motionless and spoke coldly, his gaze filled with intense killing intent toward Luotian.

“Hmph! What if I do?” Luotian sneered, his hands not stopping at all as if he had ignored Sun Shaohui’s words.

Gray light struck the Blue Dragon Arena, creating a thunderous sound that left the surrounding disciples speechless.

The powerful explosion echoed across the Blue Dragon Arena, and the entire arena was crushed into a deep pit by the gray mountain. Kong Mingzi hadn’t even escaped his soul, and after the dust settled, a pool of blood lay on the Blue Dragon Arena.

“Kong Mingzi is dead!”

“The reigning champion of the Blue Dragon Arena, Kong Mingzi, is dead!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples were speechless, unable to believe what they saw.

Luotian stood on the arena, his aura radiating endless dominance as he glanced at Jiang Sici and Sun Shaohui.

At this moment, Luotian was arrogant; he had decided to stop concealing himself. He understood that sometimes, patience couldn’t solve problems.

“Damn!” Sun Shaohui’s face darkened as he looked at Luotian, his killing intent unrestrained. His aura surged skyward.

“You dare defy my words! You’re the second!” Sun Shaohui’s face showed a hint of pain.

Sun Shaohui had to feel the pain; Kong Mingzi was a One Source Supreme, and he had spent great effort to have him under his command. Now, Luotian had killed him, and Sun Shaohui suffered heavy losses. Plus, he had lost to Jiang Sici’s Dragon Cry Sword before—Sun Shaohui was in a terrible mood.

“Brother, what should we do?” Sun Shaowen’s face was equally dark; he hadn’t expected a mere attendant to turn the tables. Now, Luotian’s displayed strength had drawn the attention of the Blue Dragon Sect elders.

Jiang Sici’s face showed flashes of light; she was also shaken. She had thought Luotian would surely die, giving him three days to handle his affairs. But now, in just three days, he had reached the Supreme Stage and killed the veteran One Source Supreme Kong Mingzi—completely beyond her expectations.

Not only Sun Shaohui but another person in the crowd looked grim, their face dark to the point of almost crying.

Sima Qiong had thought Luotian would surely lose, so he accepted the bet. No one had expected Luotian to pull off a stunning reversal.

“Bet one thousand…!” Sima Qiong couldn’t even imagine how much he would have to pay Luotian.

Zhang Qingsheng, who had just been taken by Sima Qiong as his attendant, looked delighted. He hadn’t expected Luotian to win either, but he was grateful for Luotian’s help when he first arrived. Though it wasn’t intentional, he still felt grateful toward Luotian.

“M… Master… look… this…” Zhang Qingsheng’s face showed a hint of fear as he took out the ticket for five thousand yuan energy stones he had bet with Sima Qiong and handed it to him.

“Buzz…” Sima Qiong felt unwell; his eyes stared at the ticket with five thousand yuan energy stones. Each character seemed like a needle piercing his heart.

“Let’s call it off!” Seeing Sima Qiong’s pale face, Zhang Qingsheng spoke softly.

“Gambling has no father-son bond! I, Sima Qiong, accept defeat!” Sima Qiong gritted his teeth, counting all the yuan energy stones on him—thirty billion total. He divided them into twenty storage bags and handed them to Zhang Qingsheng.

“The rest is owed—this is the IOU for twenty billion!” Sima Qiong almost cried, handing the IOU to Zhang Qingsheng’s hand.

Chapter 753: Battle Against Sun Shaohui

Chapter 753: Battle Against Sun Shaohui

Feeling Sun Shaohui’s unrestrained killing intent, Luotian’s gaze gradually darkened. His battle spirit surged as he stood on the arena without descending, seemingly waiting for something.

“You really dare defy my words!” Sun Shaohui spoke softly, years of being suppressed by Jiang Sici had made him feel worse. Now even a servant of hers dared to defy him.

“You’re what? Why should I listen to you!” Luotian’s gaze flickered slightly, lingering on Sun Shaohui for a while before subtly glancing at Jiang Sici.

“Boom…” Luotian’s words caused the Blue Dragon Sect disciples to erupt in chaos, their gazes turning toward Luotian. Most of them showed admiration.

For years, no one had dared to speak like that to Sun Shaohui except Jiang Sici.

“Brave, I don’t know where this kid got his confidence!” Hearing Luotian’s words, even Sima Qiong was impressed but soon felt pain over the countless yuan energy stones he had to pay. He didn’t know how to repay Luotian.

Though Luotian’s gaze was barely perceptible, it didn’t escape Jiang Sici and Sun Shaohui. Both of their faces darkened.

Especially Jiang Sici, who had always been high and mighty in the Blue Dragon Sect—no one had ever insulted her like this. Though she felt some regret for Luotian, it didn’t mean she would tolerate a servant.

“Jiang Senior, should we change the rules for the next match? I’ll play with this servant!” Sun Shaohui’s face twisted with menace, looking at Jiang Sici.

Luotian’s words had completely angered the two Blue Dragon Sect geniuses, and Sun Shaohui was 100% sure Jiang Sici would agree to his request.

“Fine,” Jiang Sici’s eyes flashed with coldness, nodding slightly before saying nothing more.

“Thank you for your kindness, Jiang Senior!” Sun Shaohui’s lips curled up as he flew onto the arena. His gaze was playful, looking at Luotian.

“Kid, the next match is between you and me. You have no objections, right? But even if you do, it’s useless—this is just giving you a chance to live!” Sun Shaohui smiled playfully, addressing Luotian.

“Do I have a choice?”

“You really think you can kill me? Don’t let your tail wag the dog!” Luotian showed no fear, his gaze cold as he looked at Sun Shaohui.

“Hmph!” Sun Shaohui sneered, leaping onto the arena. His aura surged skyward, pressing toward Luotian.
