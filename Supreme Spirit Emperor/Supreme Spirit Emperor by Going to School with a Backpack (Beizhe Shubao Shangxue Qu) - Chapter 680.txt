"Son of a bastard!" Luo Tian and Mo Tian cursed in their hearts. As they finished cursing, a thunderous explosion echoed, shaking the altar beneath them.

Rumbling...

The black mist dissipated, revealing Cao Dezhu and Sun Kemin, their eyes alight with anticipation as they gazed upon the altar, now reduced to a space of merely ten feet.

"He's here! He's coming!" Cao Dezhu's eyes gleamed with excitement as the mist cleared, revealing a vaguely discernible figure clad only in his upper body.

The black mist finally vanished, and the four leapt onto the altar. But as they stepped onto it, a radiant light suddenly flashed before their eyes.

Instinctively, they turned toward the light. The moment they saw it, regret washed over them—too late to react. A cold moon materialized in their minds, darkening Cao Dezhu's expression.

"Luotian! It really is you!" A startled voice echoed as they struggled to shake off the icy gaze. After all, they had already been deceived once before, gaining some resistance. Their final glimpse revealed Luo Tian and Mo Tian standing there, prompting a startled exclamation.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

Before they could finish speaking, Zhang Chenglong and the others collapsed to the ground, their eyes turning silver. Had they been prepared, they wouldn't have fallen for it. But Zhang Chenglong's overconfidence had led to their second deception by Luo Tian's Evil Mirror and Mo Tian's Eclipse Eye.

Mo Tian quickly grabbed the clothes from the ground, his haste leaving him without time to dress properly.

"I'll kill them!" Mo Tian roared, raising his sword toward Zhang Chenglong and the others.

"Wait, Mo! It's better not to kill them," Luo Tian intercepted, his expression puzzled.

"Luotian, your actions are dangerous. If not for you breaking the illusion, we might have died from overexertion. Had these men not tampered with us, we could've escaped the illusion."

"You can't just rely on instinct. Just because they called your name doesn't mean you should kill them. What if they were sent by the Celestial Realm to assassinate you? If they awaken again, will we have to run?" Mo Tian confronted Luo Tian.

"I have a plan!"

"I truly don't want to use it," Luo Tian shook his head, still preventing Mo Tian from killing the four.

"Fine!" Mo Tian nodded, unwilling to defy Luo Tian's face.

As they spoke, Luo Tian waved his hands, and black energy surged forth, forming into serpentine symbols that coiled around Cao Dezhu and the others.

"Souls-Planting!" Luo Tian bellowed, the black symbols sinking into their bodies and binding their dantian.

"What!" Mo Tian's face shifted as he recognized the technique—similar to Wang Mie Tian's method that had nearly wiped out all the disciples. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to wield it too.

"This is secure," Luo Tian smiled, snatching a black crystal from Zhang Chenglong's chest. It was the very stone they had unearthed from the first altar.

"What is this?" Luo Tian and Mo Tian stared in bewilderment. The black crystal radiated an immense, icy aura, chilling Luo Tian's body as if under scrutiny. It was clearly no ordinary item.

"It's an eye!" Mo Tian's eyes flashed with intensity as he scrutinized the crystal, perceiving its essence beyond Luo Tian's view.

"What?" Luo Tian's expression shifted slightly; he hadn't expected it to be an eye, a thought that unsettled him.

"Luotian, please let me have it! No matter the cost, I beg you!" Mo Tian's eyes burned with eagerness. If he could refine this eye, his strength would soar significantly.

"Take it," Luo Tian waved his hand, sending the black crystal to Mo Tian's grasp.

Mo Tian didn't hesitate; he eagerly accepted it, agreeing to any conditions Luo Tian set, for the power within the eye was immense—perhaps even surpassing his Eclipse Eye.

"I obtained the Mountain-Sea Cauldron before; giving it to you is natural," Luo Tian shook his head, uninterested in any recompense.

"Luotian! From now on, Shengui Wangcheng will fully cooperate with your every command!" Mo Tian declared, even swearing an oath. To him, Luo Tian's Mountain-Sea Cauldron was impressive, but it paled in comparison to this eye.

"Luotian!" As Mo Tian's words faded, four voices echoed in their ears.

"You bastard! Luotian, it really is you! You're my curse!" Sun Kemin cursed, breaking free of the bindings.

"Luotian, you little bastard! You've even tricked me twice!" Zhang Chenglong cursed, stunned to find it was truly Luo Tian.

Yet their curses were laced with excitement; after all, this was the purpose of their journey.

"Speak," Luo Tian's face remained expressionless as he addressed them.

"You little bastard! It's because of you we came here, to this hellish place!" Cao Dezhu cursed, approaching Luo Tian.

But Luo Tian's icy gaze froze him in place, his eyes carrying a bitter smile.

"Good thing this kid still has some conscience; he didn't kill us. If he had, we'd be truly miserable!" Zhang Chenglong muttered, his tone tinged with admiration.

"Old fool, I don't know if you're dead or not, but I know for sure you won't die!" Sun Kemin shot back, silencing Zhang Chenglong. After all, if Zhang Chenglong were to die so easily, he'd have already done so.

"Who said he's not dead? None of you will live today!" As Zhang Chenglong's words ended, a cold voice echoed in their ears. A towering figure stood at the altar's edge, his black hair cascading over his shoulders, eyes cold and scanning them. His body radiated dark energy.

Chapter 2542: Dongbo Xin (The War God)

"Who!" Luo Tian's group turned sharply, their faces darkening as they faced the imposing figure.

"Uncle Dongbo!" Sun Kemin, Sima Tuo, and Cao Dezhu's faces lit with disbelief.

The figure was none other than the Mad Elder Dongbo Xin, once a legendary warrior who had helped suppress the Ancient King Clan alongside Gu Tian and Ji Jiuyou. His presence had delayed their invasion, allowing this generation to grow. Sun Kemin and Cao Dezhu remembered him vividly—invincible, even saving their lives. They never expected to meet him here, but his current state was clearly off.

"An old acquaintance," Dongbo Xin smiled, his gaze sweeping over Luo Tian's group, sending a chill through them.

"Reincarnation!" Cao Dezhu gasped, his voice laced with pain.

Hearing this, Sun Kemin's face darkened—this was a revered power, now reduced to this. Hatred flared in their eyes as they leapt toward Dongbo Xin.

"Overconfident!" Dongbo Xin sneered, raising his hand to strike. The void trembled as a massive black hand descended upon them.

*Boom! Boom!*

The thunderous sound echoed as Cao Dezhu and Sun Kemin were thrown to the ground, coughing blood.

"Who are you?" Zhang Chenglong's face darkened as he reached out, sending an invisible wave that propelled Cao Dezhu and Sun Kemin back to his side.

"You're nothing but ants!" Dongbo Xin's gaze finally landed on Luo Tian.

"Unique constitution, yet still useless. Just an early-stage Celestial King—hand over the Epoch Book!"

"Submit to me for a millennium, and I may let you live," Dongbo Xin addressed Luo Tian. His words sent a tremor through Luo Tian and Sun Kemin's bodies.

"His target is the Epoch Book?" Cao Dezhu's face was stunned; he knew Luo Tian possessed it, but few others did. Only those closest to Luo Tian knew.

Luo Tian's body trembled; he hadn't expected the enemy to seek the Epoch Book.

"It must be when I activated the Epoch Book earlier—he sensed it," Luo Tian realized, blood splattering from his mouth as he gripped his sword.

"Indeed, but his strength is weak," Dongbo Xin spoke, then suddenly appeared before Luo Tian. A simple punch aimed at him.

"Fast! Early-stage Celestial King!" Luo Tian's face twisted as he felt the opponent's power.

Luo Tian had no time to think, raising his sword to block. The collision sent a massive force through him.

*Puke!* Blood spewed from Luo Tian's mouth as he was thrown back, his eyes wide with disbelief.

"变态!" (Monstrous!) Mo Tian and the others felt a shiver; Luo Tian's strength was known to them. Even he had been thrown back, leaving them no hope.

"Good enough to survive my first punch; in my time, you'd be a genius," Dongbo Xin's face showed surprise.

"What's one punch?" Luo Tian's feet carved two furrows as he steadied himself, coldly speaking. He activated Huangquan Step and rushed toward Dongbo Xin.

*Zhu! ZHU!* Six punches erupted as Luo Tian unleashed his "Blade of Chaos," striking Dongbo Xin.

Due to his memory loss, Luo Tian didn't recognize Dongbo Xin, so he fought with full power.

Seeing Luo Tian's "Blade of Chaos," Dongbo Xin's eyes narrowed, then he countered with a single punch. The collision produced an ear-splitting crack.

*Crack!* Luo Tian was thrown back again, his face filled with shock. Dongbo Xin also retreated slightly, his eyes mirroring surprise.

"Excellent—no wonder you possess the Epoch Book. Even in my youth, I was no better!" Dongbo Xin spoke softly.

"Monstrous!" Cao Dezhu's group was stunned, watching Dongbo Xin. They hadn't expected him to be stronger than Luo Tian.

"Old man, can you beat him?" Sun Kemin turned to Zhang Chenglong, the group's strongest.

"I don't know; I rarely fight," Zhang Chenglong muttered, watching Dongbo Xin clash with Luo Tian again.

"More than just defeating him—we should try to save him!" Cao Dezhu reminded them. After all, Dongbo Xin was one of their own; if he wasn't fully possessed, they had to save him.

"It's difficult. I'll observe a bit longer; the kid should hold out for a while," Zhang Chenglong frowned. Normally, he'd flee, but now he couldn't.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

The thunderous clashes continued, each one leaving Luo Tian bloodied and battered.

"I'll help you!" Mo Tian couldn't watch anymore, his eyes glowing silver as a waning moon emerged. Invisible waves enveloped Dongbo Xin and Luo Tian.

"An illusion—nothing to me!" Dongbo Xin sneered, laughing as he kicked Luo Tian away.

"We'll help too!" Cao Dezhu darted toward Dongbo Xin, feeling Luo Tian's struggle. Though they couldn't match Dongbo Xin, they could at least share the burden.

"More fools?" Dongbo Xin sneered, then struck Cao Dezhu with a palm.

*Boom!* Cao Dezhu was thrown to the ground like an insect.

"Those were his days, how powerful he was!" Cao Dezhu's words echoed as Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo froze, watching Dongbo Xin charge again.

"Uncle Dongbo! What's happened to you?" Sun Kemin sighed inwardly; he couldn't believe the invincible Dongbo Xin had been possessed. It was hard to accept.

"Still watching? Fight!" Cao Dezhu, trembling but determined, wiped his mouth and rushed toward Dongbo Xin.

*ZHU!* A purple dagger appeared in Cao Dezhu's hand, plunging toward Dongbo Xin's back.

"Speed without strength is useless!" Dongbo Xin sneered, ignoring the dagger.

"Don't underestimate me!" Cao Dezhu's eyes burned with madness; this was his chance to wound Dongbo Xin.

The sound of a sonic boom echoed as the purple dagger pierced through space, striking Dongbo Xin's back.

"Hit!" Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo's eyes lit with joy, surprised by the ease of their success.

"Crack!" But as their joy rose, Cao Dezhu was thrown back again. The dagger had only pierced an inch into Dongbo Xin's body, causing no real damage.

"His flesh is still lacking; even an ant wounded him!" Dongbo Xin grabbed the dagger, tossing it back toward Cao Dezhu.

*Puke!* The dagger pierced Cao Dezhu's thigh, blood gushing out. He had no time to react.

"Kill!" Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo roared, forcing themselves forward. Luo Tian and Mo Tian were already heavily wounded; if not for Cao Dezhu's earlier distraction, they'd be useless.

"Overconfident!" Dongbo Xin sneered, his form like a mountain as he repelled their attacks without moving. Only Luo Tian's strikes could slightly shake him, leaving the others feeling helpless.

"Divine Storage!"

"Eclipse!" Mo Tian roared, his hands moving as a black coffin descended. Silver moons also appeared, striking Dongbo Xin.

"Six Realms Reincarnation!" On the other side, Luo Tian finally unleashed his ultimate technique. As if coordinated, they all used their strongest moves.

Each move radiated destruction, darkening the sky and causing thunderous roars. Finally, Dongbo Xin's expression shifted.

"Powerful forces!"

"Divine Punishment!" Dongbo Xin bellowed, his body exploding with energy. Thunder surged as it clashed with Luo Tian's techniques.

The explosion was overwhelming, a wild wave sweeping across the battlefield. The altar they had nearly stripped was shattered into dust.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

Luo Tian and the others fell to the ground, gazing at Dongbo Xin's position, now a chaotic realm.

Chapter 2543: Zhang Chenglong's Tactics

Destructive energy surged as several powerful techniques converged, enough to kill an early-stage Celestial King. Yet the group remained cautious, watching Dongbo Xin's direction with vigilance.

"This man is beyond limits; even a late-stage Celestial King wouldn't match him," Sun Kemin muttered, feeling Dongbo Xin's terrifying strength.

"Few can fight an early-stage Celestial King," Zhang Chenglong observed, his gaze on the calm battlefield. Though he rarely fought, he was a top Celestial King. Even he felt Dongbo Xin's overwhelming power.

"Indeed," as they marveled, a voice echoed in their ears, making Cao Dezhu's group shiver.

A towering figure stood there, his robust body exuding pressure. Dry blood clung to his lips.

"Long time since I bled!" Dongbo Xin smiled, scanning the group before stepping forward.

"Boom..." The overwhelming energy surged again as Dongbo Xin reappeared before Luo Tian, his target clearly Luo Tian and the Epoch Book.

*Boom!* Two punches collided; Luo Tian was thrown back again, as if hitting a mountain. The rebound force made his head ring.

"Master屠天 (Tushan) can't fight anymore; I must rely on myself!" Luo Tian's pale face whispered.

"Divine Punishment!" Dongbo Xin roared, sending divine thunder to strike Cao Dezhu's group. They had no choice but to dodge the overwhelming thunder.

"Old man, how are you observing?" Sun Kemin cursed, dodging the thunder.

"Damn!" Mo Tian muttered, watching Luo Tian battle Dongbo Xin amidst the thunder. Luo Tian was in dire danger, dodging thunder while fending off attacks. He'd been struck by lightning multiple times; if it were anyone else, they'd be obliterated.

Luo Tian's indomitable body had endured this far, but now he bore injuries that hindered his strength.

His feet scraped the ground as he shattered ruins, spitting blood, nearly vomiting out his organs.

"Mountain-Sea Cauldron!" Seeing Dongbo Xin charge again, Luo Tian waved his hand. A massive cauldron with ancient aura appeared before him, blocking Dongbo Xin's palm.

*Zhen!* The sound of a quake echoed as the Mountain-Sea Cauldron was smashed by Dongbo Xin's palm, sending Luo Tian flying.

"Thorny! How did he become so strong? Even the Six Realms Reincarnation didn't affect him!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly.

"Die!" As Luo Tian cursed, Dongbo Xin stood atop him, a finger pointing down like crushing an ant. Black fingers descended, pressing down with overwhelming pressure that shattered the realm around Luo Tian.

"Done!" Luo Tian sighed, his eyes wild as he formed a soul sword above him, slicing at the black finger.

"Souls attack!" Dongbo Xin's eyes narrowed, his hands moving to warp space, surrounding himself with distorted void.

"Go!" Luo Tian waved his hand, sending over thirty seals from the ones he'd taken from Zhang Chenglong.

*Boom! Boom!* The overwhelming energy surged again, a series of terrifying techniques striking Dongbo Xin.

"Damn!" Zhang Chenglong cursed, watching the seals transform into martial arts. He'd forgotten about this.

Dongbo Xin faced the techniques without fear, his fists striking each one as they collided.

"My seals!" Zhang Chenglong's heart ached; these were his lifeblood.

Like a god descending, the group was captivated by Dongbo Xin's strength. Each punch countered one technique; after thirty punches, thirty powerful techniques were shattered before him.

Though Dongbo Xin was invincible, the seals weren't harmless; they wounded him slightly, a blade slash across his chest.

"I still have more!" Mo Tian, seeing Luo Tian use the seals, didn't hesitate to throw over a hundred seals. At this point, their lives were more important than the seals.

This time, Dongbo Xin's expression changed; the sky trembled as thunderous roars echoed across eight directions, shaking the entire city.

"Ruin!" Zhang Chenglong cursed, grabbing Luo Tian and others, sending them flying thousands of feet.

*Boom! Boom!* The thunderous sounds echoed, shaking their minds.

"Should he be dead now?" Cao Dezhu's group sighed, watching the area where they'd stood. The space of ten thousand feet was now gone; Dongbo Xin's figure vanished.

Zhang Chenglong frowned, addressing Luo Tian: "Kid, give me what you took from us. The rest is mine."

"By what right?" Mo Tian's face showed disdain; he knew Luo Tian's strength was unshakable at early-stage Celestial King. He didn't believe Zhang Chenglong could match Dongbo Xin.

"Fine," but to Mo Tian's surprise, Luo Tian nodded and handed over his storage ring.

"Kid, let's bet: after I defeat him, you return the items to us, okay?" Zhang Chenglong smiled.

"Impossible!" Mo Tian shook his head; everyone coveted those items, and he wouldn't easily hand them over.

"Refusing to drink the wine, you'll get punished!" Cao Dezhu sneered, Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo also mocking.

"Are you unaware of our current situation? If not for Luo Tian, do you think you'd be alive now?" Cao Dezhu's sneer met Mo Tian's trembling body.

"None of them are beneath me," Mo Tian thought, having witnessed their strength during the fight.

"Will you give it to us or will we strip you?" Sun Kemin rubbed his hands.

"Here," Mo Tian waved, handing the storage ring to Zhang Chenglong.

"That's better! Recognize your place; you're not Luo Tian, and we won't show mercy!" Sun Kemin was satisfied.

"Everyone dies!" As Sun Kemin's words ended, a furious voice echoed in their ears. From the ruins stood a figure—Dongbo Xin.

"He's not human; even that explosion couldn't kill him!" Their skin prickled, watching the towering figure emerge from the ruins.

Dongbo Xin was alive but wounded, his upper body bare with numerous wounds, smoke rising from his head. He looked like a bombed beggar.

"Die!" Dongbo Xin rushed toward Luo Tian, his form like thunder, appearing before him instantly.

"Fix it!" But as Dongbo Xin moved, Zhang Chenglong did too. He waved his hand, a wooden stake appearing in his grasp, driving it into the ground.

As the stake was planted, an invisible wave spread from it, binding Dongbo Xin and freezing his body.

"What..." Dongbo Xin's eyes shifted; his feet seemed bound, unable to move.

"Fix!" As Dongbo Xin was surprised, Zhang Chenglong waved again, planting another stake. Dongbo Xin's raised fist could not move.

"Damned! Those monks' techniques!" Dongbo Xin cursed, his blood boiling as he realized the stakes' origin.

"Fix! Fix! Fix!" Zhang Chenglong hurled five more stakes, rendering Dongbo Xin's limbs and head immobile.

"What technique is this?" Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief, astonished by such a method.

"Break free!" Dongbo Xin trembled, the five stakes on the ground shaking as if ready to fly.

"Zhu..." But as Dongbo Xin tried to break free, golden light radiated from his body. It was half gold, half black.

"Indeed! The demon soul was destroyed, but the divine soul remains—just suppressed. If the divine soul regains control of this body, your old master should recover!" Zhang Chenglong spoke, taking out a yellow paper. He recited incantations, biting his fingertip to draw blood onto the paper.

"Stay still!" Zhang Chenglong slapped the yellow paper on Dongbo Xin's forehead, freezing his body.

"Old man, you've got skills!" Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo cheered as they watched Zhang Chenglong easily subdue Dongbo Xin.

Chapter 2544: The War God

Two colors—gold and black—radiated from Dongbo Xin's body, two wills clashing. He roared continuously, his voice carrying dual intentions.

"Come out!" Zhang Chenglong's eyes narrowed as he chanted complex seals onto Dongbo Xin.

Five gray spiritual chains connected to the stakes glowed, shaking violently as if pulling something.

"You all should die!" Dongbo Xin roared, but his voice carried fear.

"Still not coming out? Must I use real force?" Zhang Chenglong watched Dongbo Xin's continued yelling.

As he spoke, Zhang Chenglong waved his hand, a small straw doll appearing in his grasp. The doll radiated decay, resembling those used to scare birds in fields but smaller and seemingly rotten from age.

"Who cares what you were before? Meet me today, and it's your unlucky day! Dare to reveal your name?" Zhang Chenglong shouted.

"Who am I? In ancient times, I ruled the nine heavens and ten earths, making the Heavenly Court tremble. I am the War God Jing Tian!" Dongbo Xin roared, his voice proud. Though he knew this man's question might have a trap, he wouldn't back down. He had never feared anyone, not even a soul.

"Who?" Zhang Chenglong's hand trembled; the straw doll nearly fell to the ground.

"My...?" Cao Dezhu's group was shaken.

Jing Tian, an ancient power known as the First War God. During the Heavenly Court's existence, he had contributed greatly but was too bloodthirsty, angering the Heavenly Court. He led his forces to battle the court, causing chaos and making it tremble. Finally, the Heavenly Court's ruler personally killed him.

Though his head was severed, Jing Tian had wounded the Heavenly Court's ruler, earning him a place among the gods. He was a terrifying figure; Cao Dezhu's group could imagine his dominance in ancient times.

"Let's run!" Cao Dezhu voiced the group's thought, feeling no chance of victory. This was a man who had devastated the Heavenly Court.

Mo Tian and Luo Tian's mouths twitched as they watched Jing Tian roar. The Heavenly Court and Hell had been in ancient times, so many legendary figures from that era were known to Hell.

In Hell, Jing Tian was also called the Demon God, ancestor of all demon cultivators. Even now, many factions in both the Heavenly Court and Hell worshipped the headless Jing Tian.

"Of course, he's no match for Luo Tian!" Mo Tian finally understood.

"Jing Tian! I call you, will you answer?" Zhang Chenglong shouted, his hand trembling as he held the straw doll.

"Who dares?" Jing Tian's voice was still defiant.

"Jing Tian!" Zhang Chenglong's eyes flashed with madness as he shouted.

"I am here!" Jing Tian answered, but his face shifted slightly. The five gray spiritual chains pulling him violently dragged out his soul.

The gray soul twisted, howling as it flew into Zhang Chenglong's straw doll.

Zhang Chenglong swiftly took out a bundle of yellow paper with special symbols, wrapping the doll.

"Deceitful! You tricked me!" Jing Tian's voice echoed through the paper.

"I swear, this won't hold! You're just a fragment of a soul; how dare you be arrogant before me? If it were Jing Tian's soul, I'd turn tail and run!" Zhang Chenglong cursed, adding more yellow paper to wrap the doll.

"Yous..." As Zhang Chenglong pondered, Dongbo Xin's body changed—his towering form collapsed to the ground, his gaze weakly looking at Luo Tian.

"Uncle Dongbo?" Cao Dezhu's eyes were full of confusion, his heart uneasy. This was the first time they'd seen Dongbo Xin in such a state; he had always stood straight.

"It's me," Dongbo Xin spoke, slowly standing up but taking a long time for the effort.

"Luotian, why are you here?" Dongbo Xin's gaze fell on Luo Tian, knowing he was the group's leader.

"We know each other?" Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion; he hadn't expected to recognize this man.

"Uncle Dongbo, this kid lost his memory; he doesn't know anyone. Don't talk to him—explain your situation!" Cao Dezhu addressed Dongbo Xin, explaining Luo Tian's condition and helping him up.

"Back then, the Celestial Path collapsed, I fell into this city and entered the Dao Realm. After entering the Dao Realm, I developed two souls—one divine, one demonic."

"Later, this man possessed me, destroying my demon soul. My divine soul has been clinging to life," Dongbo Xin sighed, his years of suffering evident. If Luo Tian's group had arrived later, he wouldn't have endured.

"Is he truly Jing Tian?" Cao Dezhu's group felt relief but looked at Zhang Chenglong's straw doll.

"It could be, it could not. Back then, Jing Tian was decapitated by the Heavenly Court's ruler. His head fell from the court and vanished. Later, someone found it, splitting it into eight pieces and sealing it in this city as an altar."

"He is the fragment of Jing Tian's soul, growing stronger over time by absorbing wishes," Dongbo Xin explained. As the possessed one, he knew Jing Tian well.

"Ah! I see now!" They nodded, but were awed by Jing Tian's power. A soul fragment had been so strong it possessed Dongbo Xin and nearly wiped them out.

"You can't contain me! I am Jing Tian, the First War God!" As they marveled, Jing Tian's mighty voice echoed.
