“Elder Brother, let me help you!” Chen Zhanbiao saw Xu Lizi yi charging forward. His massive body, like a black tower, strode through the stars with thunderous steps, following closely behind Xu Lizi yi.

“Boy, your opponent is me!” A golden-winged great peng clan’s Saint Prince stood beside Chen Zhanbiao, his face cold. His gaze was icy—this was the younger brother of the Saint Prince slain by Luo Tian in the Yuan Gu Palace. Having now attained mastery, he had long sought vengeance against Luo Tian for devouring his elder brother.

“Good!” Chen Zhanbiao regarded the youth as food, a gong-like voice resounding as he charged forward. His fists, thick as tree trunks, radiated explosive power, smashing toward the young man.

On another front, Zheng Xin, Wan Lingkong, and Gu Lei clashed with other Saint Princes. The battle erupted, its immense fluctuations drawing more and more beast domain inhabitants. Their eyes widened in awe as they watched the fierce combat, gasping in disbelief.

“Is that Luo Tian? Why is he fighting with our beast domain’s Saint Princes? And it seems to be a life-or-death clash?” Beasts murmured in confusion. They knew well Luo Tian’s close bond with the beast domain’s great elder, Diao Yuanshan. Diao Yuanshan had journeyed across the heavens to rescue Luo Tian from the Divine Race—everyone knew this.

Though the beast domain served as attendants to eight great saint clans, they understood both sides were untouchable. One was the major saint clans; the other was Luo Tian, protected by Diao Yuanshan, a primordial power. Neither could they afford to offend. Thus, though many watched, few dared intervene—only a few saint realm elders from the eight great clans attacked Gu Lei and his group.

“Damn it! You dare touch my elder, I’ll kill you!” Amidst the hesitation of onlookers, a figure clad in black emerged from the crowd. His perfect, strikingly handsome appearance pushed through the throng. As he spoke, people’s mouths twitched—how could such an elegant youth curse so violently?

“Brothers, follow me! Kill these dogs!” The black-clad youth roared, leading his companions into battle. He immediately targeted a elephant clan’s Saint Prince.

“You little ant! How dare you attack me!” The elephant clan youth recognized the black-clad man—this was the Star Dragon Ant Clan stationed under Diao Yuanshan in the Peng clan’s territory.

“You’re nothing but a big piece of meat!” Yan Jun sneered, looking down at the hulking elephant clan Saint Prince. He struck with a single punch, unafraid.

“Die!” The elephant clan Saint Prince glared, his eyes flashing with ferocity.

The elephant clan ranked low among the eight great saint clans. Their patriarch had once been slain by Luo Tian, and they ascended to the rank of great saint clan through sheer strength. Now seeing Yan Jun’s audacity, they sneered inwardly.

“Boom…” The elephant clan Saint Prince’s thick arm, thicker than Yan Jun’s thigh, smashed toward him.

“Pang…” In an instant, a shocking sight unfolded—his massive fist collided with Yan Jun’s and was sent flying backward.

“Such a terrifying Star Dragon Ant Clan!” People marveled, stunned that this clan—so low-key since entering the beast domain—was so formidable.

Yan Jun’s group of over a dozen clan members were equally terrifying, tearing apart several phoenix clan warriors. Blood splattered across the stars.

“Yan Jun, my good brother!” Xu Lizi yi laughed, repelling the dragon clan Saint Prince with a punch. His eyes held warmth.

“Kill!” The thunderous clash never ceased, as both sides clashed evenly, leaving the beast domain’s beasts awestruck by the relentless fluctuations.

“Nirvana Nine Transformations! Immortal Blood Phoenix!” Feng Jiutian, trapped within an eggshell, finally could not bear it. He roared, the shell shattering like rebirth from fire. Crimson aura surrounded him, and in an instant, he transformed into his true form—his massive body obscured the stars. The aura of a supreme being radiated from him.

“I said it was useless!” Luo Tian saw Feng Jiutian’s massive form, his face still smiling. He leapt into motion, instantly appearing beside Feng Jiutian. His left hand wielded the Dao Sealing Fist, while his right hand held the Divine King Nine Heavens Map, striking Feng Jiutian.

“Go away!” Feng Jiutian cried out, his voice echoing. His body soared skyward, wind swirling into a storm. He spat black fire, vast as an ocean, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Immortal Fire!”

“Unexpectedly, Feng Jiutian has cultivated Immortal Fire. Does that mean he’s achieved an immortal body?” Lower-ranked beasts trembled, kneeling in reverence beneath the stars.

As people marveled at Feng Jiutian’s power, the Divine King Nine Heavens Map thundered down, striking Feng Jiutian. Luo Tian was also engulfed in the black flames.

“Go…!” Luo Tian spat out endless divine light, the three thousand Dao powers surging within it. It transformed into an unbreakable sword, clashing with the black flames and breaking through them. Luo Tian reappeared beside Feng Jiutian, striking with a punch.

Eight directions trembled as Luo Tian unleashed his might, smashing Feng Jiutian’s massive body. Phoenix blood rained down, dyeing the entire starfield red, splashing onto Luo Tian’s body.

Feng Jiutian cried out in anguish, first struck by the Divine King Nine Heavens Map and then crushed by Luo Tian’s furious punch. His massive body could no longer endure, collapsing in a shower of blood and flesh before the onlookers.

“End!” Luo Tian extended his hand, Dao power spreading beneath the stars, entering Feng Jiutian’s flesh.

“No! It’s not over!” A low roar echoed through the stars. Feng Jiutian’s shattered flesh suddenly surged upward, black flames rising instantly. His blood and flesh transformed into a mass of black fire, consuming Luo Tian’s Dao laws.

A hum resonated; the black flames reassembled themselves, forming a black phoenix. Feng Jiutian’s figure reappeared before Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, you cannot kill me—I am immortal!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened, his gaze on Luo Tian filled with endless hatred.

“Immortal? Many have told me he was immortal, but they all ended up destroyed by me.” Luo Tian’s face finally showed a trace of seriousness. He felt that after being shattered, Feng Jiutian had not only retained his strength but grown stronger.

Yet Luo Tian knew this abnormal enhancement was likely due to a forbidden technique of the phoenix clan.

“Your greatest mistake was fighting me outside the Saint City. No matter the outcome, I would not die, but you will!” Feng Jiutian transformed into human form, his face dark and cruel. He glared at Luo Tian, black runes spreading from his hands.

Chapter 1165: The Divine Mirror of the Beast Domain

In the starfield beneath the Beast Domain’s Saint City, Feng Jiutian bore exhaustion as he gazed at Luo Tian standing a thousand zhang away. His aura remained at the peak of Saint, his eyes deep and resolute as his hands moved swiftly.

A hum echoed; black flames surrounded Feng Jiutian, but to everyone’s surprise, he did not direct them toward Luo Tian. Instead, they surged into the ground of the Beast Domain’s Saint City.

“What does this mean?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, watching the terrifying flames cause no harm to the Saint City but instead sinking into its earth.

“Luo Tian, you’re too careless! Thinking your mastery of the Saint peak allows you to dominate all nine domains? You’ve forgotten the depth of the sacred domain’s saint clans. We’ve endured countless epochs and still stand firm—do you think our depth is inferior to the Divine Race?” Feng Jiutian’s face twisted with madness as he spoke, now regarding Luo Tian as a dead man.

“Boom…” As Feng Jiutian’s words faded, the entire Beast Domain Saint City erupted with radiant light. A blinding beam shot into the sky, forming a fiery dragon that surged from the city—its power multiplied several times over Feng Jiutian’s previous flames. It raged toward Luo Tian, devastating and unstoppable.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with alarm. The black flames’ intensity and temperature were far greater than before, capable of annihilating a half-epoch strength. Luo Tian knew even his body would suffer heavy damage, losing the ability to fight.

“Epoch power! I sense the aura of an epoch treasure!” In a blink, Luo Tian understood why the flames were so strong—it was enhanced by an epoch treasure.

“Divine Mirror of the Beast King!” Luo Tian sighed internally, this time facing a real problem. Feng Jiutian had clearly activated the Beast Domain’s depth—the epoch treasure, Divine Mirror of the Beast King.

“Did you bring it?” Feng Jiutian seemed to have anticipated Luo Tian had not brought the Ancient Heaven Palace, his eyes filled with contempt as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Pressure surged as the flames erupted, instantly engulfing the starfield. Gu Lei and Zheng Xin retreated from their opponents, sweat drenching their brows. Though only a trace of the epoch master’s aura remained, it was enough to overwhelm them.

“Die!” Feng Jiutian’s eyes gleamed with triumph, his gaze on Gu Lei and the others. He awaited the black flames to burn Luo Tian to death, then finish off Gu Lei and Zheng Xin.

“I didn’t bring the Ancient Heaven Palace, but how much power can you draw from an epoch treasure?” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened. His golden light flared, and the Shangtian Bow materialized in his hand.

“With just this broken bow? You think it can withstand my immortal fire enhanced by the Divine Mirror of the Beast King?” Feng Jiutian sneered, his contempt deepening as he saw Luo Tian draw the Shangtian Bow.

“Then what about this?” A flash of light—golden spear, the Rupture Heaven Spear, resonated with an aura surpassing a pseudo-epoch treasure. It was placed upon the Shangtian Bow.

“Burst!” The bowstring tensed, and in an instant, Dao power spread through Luo Tian’s hands. The梵天攻击 (Bodhi Heaven Attack) shattered all laws, transforming into divine laws that entered the Rupture Heaven Spear. The spear became a golden dragon, piercing through the stars toward Feng Jiutian’s immortal fire.

“Roar…” A golden and black dragon clashed, their collision collapsing the stars, sending waves of destruction into the endless void.

Invisible fluctuations spread from their collision, striking Luo Tian and Feng Jiutian. Their flesh ached as cracks formed on Feng Jiutian’s body, as if sliced by countless blades.

Luo Tian was stronger but still suffered injuries—though minor, they had little impact on his strength.

“Even this could block it!” Beast domain spectators and Gu Lei, Xu Lizi yi were stunned. They couldn’t believe Luo Tian had blocked the flames imbued with a trace of epoch power.

Feng Jiutian was thrown back a thousand zhang before stopping, his gaze deeper than before. He too marveled at Luo Tian’s strength—how could he have become so formidable?

“I said I would kill you today!” The golden Rupture Heaven Spear appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. He leapt into the void, instantly appearing behind Feng Jiutian. The spear pierced Feng Jiutian’s body, pinning him to the stars.

“Ah…” Feng Jiutian screamed in agony as Dao power surged into his body, destroying it.

“Boom…” Blood mist scattered, and Feng Jiutian reappeared as a blood mist before the stunned onlookers.

Black flames rose again, unchanged from before—Feng Jiutian reassembled within the onlookers’ view, his aura still intact.

“How can this fight continue?” Gu Lei and others narrowed their eyes, gazing at Feng Jiutian’s reassembled form. A sense of helplessness arose—Feng Jiutian was so powerful, having been shattered twice by Luo Tian yet still alive.

“Can’t be killed?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, pondering why Feng Jiutian still survived.

“Divine Mirror of the Beast King!” He soon realized a possibility—Feng Jiutian’s bloodline and the Divine Mirror must be the cause.

“Divine Mirror of the Beast King!” Feng Jiutian’s eyes flashed with hatred, deciding to fight to the death. He fully activated the Divine Mirror, aiming to destroy Luo Tian.

Runes flashed, instantly rushing into the Saint City. Thunderous sounds echoed; the entire city trembled. In an instant, it was bathed in golden light, like a rising sun. The ancient Divine Mirror of the Beast King appeared before the onlookers, its aura overwhelming their minds.

“Divine Mirror of the Beast King!” The beasts of the Saint City trembled, kneeling in reverence to honor the epoch master, Beast King.

Beast King, once the epoch master of the beast domain, ruled one epoch. His true form was unknown—no one knew what kind of beast he truly was. He had seemingly never existed before, then emerged to unify the chaotic beast domain, establishing the Saint City and uniting the eight great saint clans under one rule.

In his later years, Beast King vanished from the beast domain, leaving behind the Divine Mirror of the Beast King as a legacy for the beast clan. As for his whereabouts, no one knew—some said he had ascended to immortality, others claimed they saw a wisp of ash on the Beast King’s altar. The beast domain believed it was the ashes left by Beast King’s ascension, while others thought he had achieved enlightenment through meditation.

Such a power as the Divine Mirror of the Beast King was beyond comprehension, even surpassing the Ancient Heaven Palace in Luo Tian’s perception.

The ancient mirror ascended into the stars, its aura of antiquity spreading across it. Its smooth surface reflected mountains and rivers, countless stars—seeming to contain another world within.

“I see what you’re trying to do!” Feng Jiutian’s face paled, his voice trembling. Activating the Divine Mirror was a heavy burden for him.

“Boom…” Feng Jiutian’s body moved like lightning, without hesitation. He rushed toward the Divine Mirror, vanishing into it in an instant, as if embedded within the endless rivers and stars.

“Boom… Boom” Thunderous sounds echoed. As Feng Jiutian entered the Divine Mirror, it emitted more thunderous sounds. Light flashed, obscuring the onlookers’ vision. Even Luo Tian’s Purple Extreme Demon Eyes could not see through the mirror’s surface. He moved swiftly, appearing before Gu Lei and Zheng Xin, sweeping his sleeve to gather them. His gaze was serious as he watched the blinding Divine Mirror.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt a hint of retreat. Facing an epoch treasure, he knew he had no chance. Yet he still clung to a sliver of hope—that Feng Jiutian was not the master of the Divine Mirror, and thus could not fully unleash its power to destroy him.

“Boom…” The blinding light gradually faded. Feng Jiutian’s figure emerged from the mirror, his eyes filled with contempt as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing no change in Feng Jiutian’s strength—same as before he entered the mirror.

Not only Luo Tian was confused, but even the beasts of the Saint City were puzzled—how could Feng Jiutian have changed?

“Hmph… This kid is doomed. Though he’s strong, can he face eight Saint peak masters?” Other clan saint princes spoke, their eyes filled with envy as they gazed at Feng Jiutian.

As one of the eight great saint clans, they knew that reaching Saint peak allowed control over the Divine Mirror. Though minimal, it was still beyond comprehension—this was the foundation left by Beast King for the beast domain. It was also a life-saving card for each saint prince.

As people marveled, the ancient mirror emitted more fluctuations. A figure emerged from it—identical in appearance and aura to Feng Jiutian, his strength also at Saint peak.

“Haha! This is one of the Divine Mirror’s functions—replication! A perfect replica!” The saint princes of the great clans smiled, speaking softly.

Chapter 1166: Slaying Feng

Outside the Saint City, the golden ancient mirror glowed like a rising sun, illuminating the entire starfield. Feng Jiutian smiled as he stood beneath the stars, gazing at Luo Tian standing a thousand zhang away. His face was serious.

The hum continued, and figures emerged from the mirror. In awe, people watched as eight figures stepped out—each exuding Saint peak strength, identical in appearance and attire to Feng Jiutian.

“Powerful! This Divine Mirror is truly beyond comprehension!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, watching the eight formidable Feng Jiutians. Each was a tangible presence with no differences.

“Luo Tian, you’re so strong! I wonder how you’ll kill me now!” The eight Feng Jiutians spoke in unison, their voices filled with confidence. With eight of themselves, even a half-epoch strength master would be hard-pressed to survive—this was the confidence of a prodigy.

“Seems I must reveal my secret weapon. I didn’t expect to use all my strength before reaching the Divine Beasts Domain—it’s quite embarrassing.” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, his expression serious.

“Kill!” The eight figures surged forward with overwhelming power, forming nine dragons that attacked Luo Tian. Each was astonishingly powerful, their presence heavy and oppressive.

“Dead! This time Luo Tian is doomed!” The beasts of the domain sighed, their voices heavy. One Feng Jiutian could be crushed by Luo Tian, but eight? No one could survive such an encounter.

“Saint peak— I’ve killed them before. Though you are a prodigy, you’re still not worthy of my attention!” Luo Tian moved swiftly, his aura rising. He leapt into the group of eight Feng Jiutians, striking one with a punch while his other hand unleashed the Divine King Nine Heavens Map against the others.

“Now you’re nothing!” Four of the eight figures engaged Luo Tian in close combat, while the other four stood in the void, preparing devastating martial arts to kill Luo Tian instantly.

Luo Tian’s body echoed with waves of thunder, his Dao Sealing Fist striking repeatedly. His punches formed a wall of light, repelling the four attackers. For a moment, he managed to suppress them.

“Powerful, but you’re still outnumbered! No chance at all!” The beasts of the domain marveled, watching the thunderous battlefield.

“Die!” Luo Tian wielded the Rupture Heaven Spear, striking one figure and piercing it through. Blood mist scattered into the stars.

But Luo Tian paid a heavy price—his back was struck by three punches from Feng Jiutian, sending him spitting blood. If it were anyone else, they would be crushed instantly. Yet Luo Tian merely broke a few bones, his golden bones protruding from his body. His face paled as he spat out divine blood.

“Don’t forget, I’m immortal!” The remaining seven Feng Jiutians sneered, attacking Luo Tian. Four of them unleashed martial arts—four red phoenixes, real as flesh, covering the stars and attacking Luo Tian from four directions. Each was terrifying to behold.

As the four martial arts converged, the figure Luo Tian had pierced into mist was absorbed by black flames and reassembled.

“Don’t think you’re the only one with tricks! I have my own!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold. He knew if he continued, he would be worn down to death. Thus, he decided not to hold back.

Luo Tian knew he had no choice but to reveal his ultimate secret—Yin Fish of the Divine Beast Dao Map. Only then did he have a chance.

A hum resonated; a black tortoise shell, like a stone, appeared before the onlookers. It emitted no powerful fluctuations, leaving people puzzled.

“What is this? Just a stone? Luo Tian, you’ve run out of tricks, using this broken stone to bluff?” Feng Jiutian sneered, unimpressed. To him, the shell had no special qualities beyond its ancient aura.

“Haha, you said you were immortal! Let me see if you truly are!” Luo Tian ignored Feng Jiutian’s words, his hands flashing with runes into the black tortoise shell.

The ordinary shell suddenly roared with thunder, divine laws spreading from it. It formed a black carp, leaping within the minds of the onlookers.

“Devour Heaven!” Luo Tian roared, commanding the black carp to attack the four red phoenix martial arts.

The black carp was small compared to the massive phoenixes, like an ant against a mountain. Yet in an instant, it opened its mouth, emitting immense suction.

“Boom…” In the onlookers’ stunned gaze, the powerful martial arts trembled and stopped mid-attack. They were sucked into the black tortoise shell, becoming red fire that vanished.

In a blink, the four martial arts disappeared from sight. The black carp devoured half the stars around it.

The Feng Jiutian figure, previously turned to mist and then black flames, was also sucked into the carp’s belly.

“This…” The remaining figures’ faces darkened—no longer could they sense the absorbed figure’s aura. It seemed to have vanished entirely.

“Horror!” The onlookers stared in awe at the black carp dancing within the stars. They couldn’t believe such an ordinary shell possessed such power.

“Kill!” Luo Tian seized the opportunity, rushing into the void like a meteor. He found his next target and struck with a spear through one Feng Jiutian’s chest, turning it into blood mist.

The suction returned, absorbing the blood mist into the black tortoise shell. The onlookers were terrified.

“Damn it!” The remaining figures panicked, never expecting Luo Tian to have such a powerful secret weapon.

“Suppress!” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, unwilling to waste more time with Feng Jiutian. He infused golden runes into the black tortoise shell.

“Boom…” The black carp exploded, growing into a black demon sun. Its heavy aura pressed down on the remaining six Feng Jiutians.

“Epoch power! This unassuming shell is an epoch treasure?” The onlookers felt the epoch power again, their eyes wide with shock. They felt the overwhelming pressure of a mountain against a commoner.

“How is this possible? It’s not an epoch treasure, but it surpasses pseudo-epoch treasures by so much. Its epoch power is overwhelming—I can’t withstand it!” Feng Jiutian’s face twisted with madness. He wanted to activate the Divine Mirror again but was powerless—unless he reached half-epoch or epoch strength, he couldn’t activate it to destroy enemies. After all, the Divine Mirror’s master was not him.

“Damn it!” Feng Jiutian trembled with fear, feeling the true threat of death. He had never imagined he would be so close to it.

Feng Jiutian wanted to flee, but under the immense pressure, he couldn’t move. He stood still, awaiting death’s arrival.

“O Great Ancestors of the Beast Domain! Save your descendants!” Feng Jiutian cried out, shouting toward the Saint City. But it remained unmoved.

“Boom…” Crimson blood sprayed everywhere, and in the onlookers’ stunned gaze, six Feng Jiutians were struck by the black demon sun and vanished.

The suction spread, and the blood mist was instantly devoured by the black carp, leaving no trace. If not for the vast stars consumed alongside it, people would never believe that the great prodigy of the phoenix clan had been slain here.

“Done!” The phoenix clan’s people looked despairing, knowing that Feng Jiutian had likely perished.

A joke—a great one. A prodigy of the phoenix clan, slain in the beast domain, outside the Saint City, even after using the Divine Mirror—no one could survive. If this spread, it would be a true embarrassment for the phoenix clan! Especially for them, it was too tragic.

The phoenix clan’s people couldn’t believe their eyes—how could their prodigy be killed like this? He had just ascended to Saint peak, full of ambition to dominate the nine domains. Yet he was slain in his first two days at Saint peak, right at home.

Luo Tian’s black tortoise shell hovered above his head as he gazed at the Saint City. After confirming no danger from it, he sighed in relief. His gaze swept over the phoenix clan’s people.

The phoenix clan’s people were furious, their eyes filled with a desire to devour Luo Tian—but they were powerless. The Saint City’s saint peak elders had followed Diao Yuanshan to the Divine Beasts Domain. The city was unusually empty, and even if they returned, people doubted they could match Luo Tian. However, with eight of them combined and the Divine Mirror, they might still be able to kill Luo Tian.

“Goodbye! Next time choose your saint princes more carefully!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the phoenix clan. He moved swiftly, appearing on the ancient warship and releasing Gu Lei and Xu Lizi yi.

Chapter 1167: The Grand Assembly

Beneath the starfield of the beast domain, the ancient warship moved slowly under the stunned gazes of the beast domain’s people. Onboard, Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Xu Lizi yi wore puzzled expressions as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Did you kill Feng Jiutian?” Zheng Xin asked, his eyes filled with confusion. They had been collected by Luo Tian the moment the Divine Mirror appeared and hadn’t witnessed the battle between Luo Tian and Feng Jiutian.

Yet, from the onlookers’ expressions alone, they guessed half the truth. Feng Jiutian’s absence made it clear.

“Damn! He was fierce, really fierce! You’re too fierce, Luo Tian! How can we live now? Your image of being tall and strong has overshadowed me!” Zheng Xin roared, his voice filled with excitement.

“Don’t you dare call yourself tall! You’re the one who runs at the first sign of trouble!” Others sneered, mocking Zheng Xin.

“Regrettable! That delicious flesh—those were food!” Chen Zhanbiao drooled, his eyes filled with disappointment. He lamented Feng Jiutian’s death was too cheap.

“Ha!” Chen Zhanbiao’s words caused Luo Tian and his companions to laugh again. The ship returned to a lively atmosphere.

The ship drifted through the stars until it vanished from the beast domain’s sight. Only then did people begin to discuss.

“Done! The beast domain will be in chaos! Feng Jiutian held a high position in the phoenix clan. His death might incite the phoenix clan’s fury. Though no one dares act now, it doesn’t mean they won’t after their saint peak elders return. Even Diao Yuanshan might not be able to protect Luo Tian.”

Luo Tian and Gu Lei didn’t care about the phoenix clan’s retaliation. After all, they had already made enemies. As long as no depth emerged, Diao Yuanshan would ensure the other clans couldn’t stir up trouble.

As Luo Tian and his group set off again, a difference was noticeable—Yan Jun and several Star Dragon Ant Clan members had joined the ship.

The ship was lively, and Luo Tian guided it. In two days, they reached the Divine Beasts Domain.

Upon entering the Divine Beasts Domain, Luo Tian’s group grew solemn. They didn’t know what awaited them in the coming days.

Luo Tian smiled, more confident than before. His Saint peak strength made him fearless against half-epoch masters. Having killed Feng Jiutian, a saint peak master, he was among the top in the nine domains unless an epoch master appeared.

The ship drifted through the stars, encountering only a few scattered disciples of the Divine Beasts Domain. Though they had plans for the ship, sensing the powerful auras of Luo Tian’s group, they dared not act.

Luo Tian didn’t head for the demon clan but directly toward the Divine Race’s territory. According to Sun Feiwen, the Divine Race had not set the assembly location at their mountain after Luo Tian’s previous chaos. They were still recovering, rebuilding a continent—this would take time.

The nine domains’ assembly was set on a remote continent near the Divine Race’s land—Zhenwu Continent, an ordinary one.

The ship became a streak of light, arriving at Zhenwu Continent’s outskirts in three days. The continent had almost no cultivators—only low-level warriors, barely qualifying as cultivators. A body-strengthening first stage cultivator could easily overpower ten warriors.

The continent’s population was small, under a million people. They were simple and pure. The massive Divine Race regarded them as true gods, worshiping them endlessly.

Zhenwu Continent had a sacred mountain—the core of the continent and where its people built a sacred mountain to worship the Divine Race. Pilgrims came daily, praying for their wishes. Sometimes, when a Divine Race disciple felt generous, they would appear on the sacred mountain to bless it with rain or fulfill one or two wishes.

“Tragic! The Divine Race uses such methods to rule a continent without cultivators. They truly regard these pitiful mortals as ants, seeing themselves as gods!” Luo Tian and his group walked the land, watching the people’s reverence toward the sacred mountain. Their hearts felt sorrow.

These people were pitiable yet happy, living simple lives without the bloodshed and intrigue of the cultivation world. Their wishes were simple—easily fulfilled by a high-level cultivator.

“Envious life!” Luo Tian sighed, longing to experience such a peaceful life—leaving behind the cruel cultivation world and its troubles.

“Power grows with responsibility. Unless one reaches the level of an epoch master, ruling nine domains for an era and venturing into the nine great dangers to choose a place of solitude!” Gu Lei and others shook their heads. They knew they could never live such lives—they needed strength to protect those they loved.

The group walked the land without using their cultivation, as ordinary people for four or five days before reaching the sacred mountain’s base.

At this time, the base was crowded with people—Zhenwu Continent’s native residents, their faces filled with devotion. They knelt before the sacred mountain, praying constantly. The people had noticed that the sacred mountain had been frequently visited by flying and moving deities in recent days.

The sacred mountain was packed, a gathering unseen for years across the nine domains. On the high platform stood influential figures from each domain—domain masters like Sun Shengtian, Diao Yuanshan, Yan Xiuluo. They sat there with saint peak elders and ancestors following them—its strength was terrifying.

“Today is the ninth day of the ninth month. I’ve gathered you here for one purpose: to discuss how to deal with the coming underworld upheaval!”

“Each of you is a pivotal figure in your domain. You must know this underworld upheaval differs from previous ones!”
