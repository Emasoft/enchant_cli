"Your recent reputation has been quite remarkable," Luo Tian said softly, a smile on his face as he addressed Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao.

"Can't help it—Zhanbiao's appetite is well known. How can we feed this beast without money?" Xu Liyi sighed, shaking his head in无奈.

"Enough," Luo Tian invited, "Would you like to take a stroll through the Ancient Divine Ruins? We can travel together." He handed Xu Liyi a storage pouch, the same one he had obtained from hunting ferocious beasts on Ice Island. Earlier, Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao had left in a hurry, and Luo Tian, exhausted, had forgotten about it.

Xu Liyi took the pouch without hesitation, his eyes glinting with amusement: "I suppose robbing talent from other regions in the Ancient Divine Ruins would be quite lucrative, wouldn't it?"

"Ha! I'll follow my elder's lead," Chen Zhanbiao chuckled, his eyes fixed on the pouch in Xu Liyi's hands.

"Uncle!" A voice suddenly echoed from the ground, drawing everyone's attention downward. At that moment, the young people on the ground wore expressions of excitement, while some elders had their cultivation sealed and were bound together.

Luo Tian's gaze fell upon the one shouting, his expression turning solemn as he smiled inwardly. Today had brought too many familiar faces—this shout was none other than his step-uncle, Wang Tianxiang, the leader of the Crazy Blade Sect.

"Whoa..." Luo Tian guided his dragon to land, stepping toward Wang Tianxiang.

"Uncle! Save me!" Wang Tianxiang looked desperate, his expression flickering with emotion.

"You know him?" Xu Liyi patted his head, murmuring, his heart aching at the thought of another ransom lost.

The disciples from the Five Elements Sect, seeing Luo Tian and Wang Tianxiang's connection, quickly untied Wang Tianxiang.

"Tianxiang, are you also going to the Ancient Divine Ruins?" Luo Tian assessed Wang Tianxiang's cultivation, which had reached the Middle Yuan Ling stage. Yet such a level was nothing more than cannon fodder in the Ancient Divine Ruins.

"Yes, I just want to take my chances," Wang Tianxiang replied calmly. After enduring much hardship, he had matured into a true sect leader.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, his voice turning cold: "Was it Zhao Lechi who sent you?"

Feeling Luo Tian's icy demeanor, Wang Tianxiang hesitated for a moment before understanding. A warm feeling stirred within him.

The Ancient Divine Ruins were perilous, and his cultivation was merely Middle Yuan Ling—unremarkable in every way. If Zhao Lechi had sent him, it was tantamount to sending him to his death.

"No," Wang Tianxiang replied firmly, "I chose this myself."

Luo Tian nodded slightly. If Wang Tianxiang had made the choice himself, there was no need to stop him. He simply said, "Then let's go together."

Wang Tianxiang was overjoyed, stepping behind Luo Tian with a smile. He greeted the disciples of the Five Elements Sect and Xu Liyi respectfully before standing beside Dong Sansi, with whom he was most familiar.

Dong Sansi's face lit up with joy; they had once followed Luo Tian through the Great An Forest years ago. Reuniting after so long, their camaraderie was natural and heartfelt.

"Luo Senior Brother, I am a disciple of the Flame Sect. Please plead for us to be released!" People saw Luo Tian and immediately pleaded with him.

"Trouble," Xu Liyi slapped his head, knowing these deals were doomed. Having spent time with Luo Tian, he understood his nature: people who respected him would earn his respect in return. Luo Tian didn't fear force but was swayed by submission. With so many people begging for mercy, Luo Tian would surely release them.

Xu Liyi had just slapped his head when Luo Tian turned, smiling at him with a clear message.

"Alas..." Xu Liyi felt immense pain, his fingers flicking as three-colored spiritual energy flowed from his hands into the captives' bodies.

Moments later, their bodies emitted a series of cracking sounds as they regained movement and cultivation. Their faces lit up with joy, thanking Luo Tian endlessly. He didn't refuse, waving his hand as they all climbed back onto the dragon and flew toward the distance.

After Xu Liyi's robbery, some people had lost their desire to head for the Ancient Divine Ruins. They hadn't even left the Northern Region before encountering these two freaks—what if they met more like them inside?

Others, however, bore determined expressions. Their figures flickered as they flew toward the Southern Region. The sky was soon filled with various-colored spiritual energy wings, streaking like light in all directions.

...

Luo Tian's group had grown even larger with the addition of Dragon Baby and Long Jie. With Luo Tian's mediation, relations between Dragon Baby, Xu Liyi, and Chen Zhanbiao had eased. Especially Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao, they seemed to have found a kindred spirit, clinging together constantly. Even Xu Liyi felt a pang of jealousy.

Luo Tian also gradually understood why Long Jie had suddenly matured and become so powerful. They were naturally bonded, and with his own recent rapid cultivation growth, Dragon Baby's strength had also steadily increased. Add the rare herbs and beasts from the Great An Forest, as well as the guidance of Long Jian and his wife, and even a talentless person could be cultivated into a genius.

The true transformation of Dragon Baby, however, came from the mysterious dragon soul within his body. This soul was none other than the Second Emperor of Dragons, and Dragon Baby's acceptance of its inheritance had made him so formidable. Even Luo Tian dared not claim he could subdue Dragon Baby in his prime.

As they flew on the dragon's back, laughing and chatting, after five days of travel, they felt the spiritual energy growing denser. A hundred-foot stone tablet appeared in their consciousness, inscribed with two characters that stirred them.

The tablet read "Southern Region," as if naturally formed in their minds, prompting Luo Tian to gaze toward the south.

"The Southern Region, I'm coming!" Luo Tian's heart cried out as he looked toward the location of the Yumen Sect on his mental map.

Chapter 583: The Might of the Southern Region

As Luo Tian's group entered the Southern Region, they immediately felt its spiritual energy was far denser than in the Northern Region. Lei Yong and others were curious, noting how vast the difference was merely by crossing a stone tablet.

The Ancient Divine Ruins lay at the heart of the Southern Region, so Luo Tian's group pressed further south. The sky filled with more flying figures, radiant light flowing as their dragon seemed unremarkable compared to others. Their dragon was merely at the Bone-Subjugation peak, and in the Southern Region, it was nothing more than a joke.

Luo Tian remained calm while others felt the disdainful glances of those passing by, their expressions darkening.

Except for Dong Sansi and Wang Yulan, the others were not exactly peacekeepers. How often had they been looked down upon? If it weren't for Luo Tian's current delicate situation, they would have already stopped those people and broken their legs.

"Five days," the group mentally calculated Luo Tian's recovery time, standing on the dragon's back with puffed cheeks, enduring the scornful glances around them.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian's group was about to go mad, a thunderous dragon roar echoed behind them. A dragon much larger than theirs appeared, advancing toward Luo Tian's group.

"Move aside!" A sharp voice rang out, though it was a woman's tone, it carried an air of dominance. People flying in the sky naturally made way for her.

"An Yuan Ling dragon?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed, recognizing the voice but unable to place it immediately.

"Hey? You told us to move?" Lei Yong and the others' faces showed anger. They had endured countless glares, and this "move" ignited their pent-up frustration.

"I won't move! What are you going to do about it?" Lei Yong's voice thundered, echoing toward the dragon now five thousand feet away.

"It's her!" Luo Tian's powerful spiritual sense swept over the opposing dragon, a smile forming on his face.

"Trouble at every turn," Luo Tian sighed, patting his head, which had swollen from the journey.

"Then we'll send you down," the voice continued. "A Bone-Subjugation peak dragon dares to be so bold in front of us!"

As the voice spoke, the Yuan Ling dragon had already closed in to two thousand feet. It let out a deafening roar, its overwhelming dragon aura pressing toward Luo Tian's group. The sound formed an invisible wave that struck their ears.

They quickly shielded Luo Tian, blocking the aura. But the dragon beneath them was ignored, its massive body trembling in fear, its eyes filled with委屈.

"Who dares to use dragon aura before me?" Long Jie sneered, stepping forward and gently patting the dragon's body.

"Don't be afraid. Go up!" Long Jie spoke softly, as if a king comforting his people.

"Roar..." The dragon, sensing Long Baby's presence, roared and seemed to have taken some drug, no longer fearing the Yuan Ling dragon's pressure. It streaked back into the sky, now only a thousand feet away from the opposing dragon.

A thousand feet was not far for them; with their eyes, they could already see each other.

"Women?" Xu Liyi's eyes gleamed as he looked at the people on the opposing dragon.

"Disgusting!" The group muttered, their faces showing disdain as they looked at Xu Liyi's sharp gaze.

If Xu Liyi had felt their stares, he would have cried out in protest. He wasn't harboring any improper thoughts—just thinking that selling these women would fetch a high price.

But Long Jie didn't care, his youthful face showing anger as he shouted at the opposing group: "Get off!"

"Roar..." The childish voice accompanied a light dragon roar, sending the opposing group into laughter.

"Little brother, go home and train for a few years before coming back to play with me!" The women on the opposing dragon smiled, addressing Long Baby.

Yet they hadn't done much when their dragon let out a mournful roar, its eyes glowing like lanterns as it trembled and fell toward the ground.

"What's going on?" The women on the dragon looked puzzled, then rushed to lift their falling dragon with spiritual energy.

But the dragon beneath Luo Tian's group looked on mockingly, its eyes filled with mockery toward the opposing beast.

"Come here," Long Jie sighed, speaking gently to the Yuan Ling dragon.

"Roar..." Hearing Long Baby's words, the dragon seemed stimulated, flapping its wings and turning over.

As the dragon turned, the women on its back were forced to leap off, their eyes wide with disbelief as they watched the dragon act like a madman.

Feeling no one was on its back, the Yuan Ling dragon seemed to become a well-behaved baby, its eyes filled with flattery as it approached Long Jie.

"Big brother, let's ride this beast's back. I'm sure it'll be faster than the other one!" Dragon Baby cheerfully called out to Luo Tian's group.

"Great! Can I eat this dragon?" Chen Zhanbiao cheered, leaping onto the Yuan Ling dragon's back with drool flowing.

"Move!" Long Jie frowned, kicking Chen Zhanbiao away.

"Reckless! Bold!" The women on the opposing dragon scolded.

"Crack..." A sound of breaking echoed, and a slender figure appeared in their view.

"Luo Tian! It's been a while!" Jiang Lerong's figure appeared, her voice pleasant yet laced with coldness.

Chapter 584: Gathering

"Uh..." Seeing the woman clearly call out his name, Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. He had changed his appearance after all.

"Surprised?" Jiang Lerong walked through the void, her ugly face carrying a playful expression. Yet everyone could hear the coldness in her voice.

"Luo Senior Brother, since you've arrived at the Southern Region, why not visit my Qionghua Sect?" Jiang Lerong spoke, her accompanying women showing a hint of hostility as spiritual energy surged, filling the sky with fragrant scents.

"Hey, Jiang Lerong's back at it again—don't even look at that face. Who'd want you?" As the women led by Jiang Lerong approached Luo Tian's group, a loud voice echoed in their ears.

"Zhou Ziyang!" Jiang Lerong's face darkened, looking toward the people who had flown in.

Luo Tian's group also furrowed their brows, and when Jiang Lerong mentioned Zhou Ziyang's name, Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao's expressions slightly changed.

"Do you know him?" Lei Yong asked, sensing their change.

"Never met him, but I've heard of him. He's ranked fifth among the Southern Region's top talents. Jiang Lerong is sixth, constantly suppressed by Zhou Ziyang, which made her resentful."

Jiang Lerong's Qionghua Sect was near Zhou Ziyang's Lingxiao Sect, and they were bitter rivals. Thus, their relationship wasn't harmonious.

"Lingxiao Sect!" Upon hearing Xu Liyi mention Lingxiao Sect, people's faces shifted, their minds naturally recalling the sect's information.

Lingxiao Sect was located on the Nine Heavens, essentially a heavenly-grade treasure. It floated in the sky, and its name was called Lingxiao Sect. Over time, people gradually referred to it as such.

"Whoosh..." A wind sound echoed, and a young man in white robes arrived before them. Luo Tian was amazed by the youth's eyes, which seemed to radiate intense light like two suns.

Behind Zhou Ziyang were another dozen young men, all with eyes like lightning, standing in white robes behind him.

"Initial Soul Formation?" Luo Tian sensed Zhou Ziyang and Jiang Lerong's cultivation, his heart stirred. He marveled at how the Southern Region produced such talent.

Lei Yong and others also felt their cultivation, their faces slightly changing before falling silent. Their group had no true Initial Soul Formation masters; only Luo Tian and Long Jie were the strongest, but even they weren't true Initial Soul Formation masters.

Thinking of this, Lei Yong's group felt a heavy heart. They hadn't even reached the entrance to the Ancient Divine Ruins yet, and they had already met two Initial Soul Formation talents. What was the cultivation of the top-ranked one?

As they pondered, Zhou Ziyang and Jiang Lerong finally met. Though no battle was fought, tension rose between them.

"Zhou Ziyang of the Southern Region," Zhou Ziyang broke the silence, turning to Luo Tian with a soft voice. Though his words seemed calm, his eyes held battle intent.

"Are you looking for my brother?" Long Jie moved forward, shielding Luo Tian behind him. His eyes were cold; if Zhou Ziyang took another step forward, he would face Long Jie's relentless attack.

"Uh..." Feeling the young man's overwhelming killing intent, Zhou Ziyang was surprised. Dragon Baby was too young; at such an age, he already gave Zhou Ziyang a sense of urgency.

"I'm just passing through!" Zhou Ziyang slowly stepped back two paces, looking at Jiang Lerong with hands raised as if watching a show.

Seeing Zhou Ziyang before her, Jiang Lerong's brows furrowed slightly. She wasn't foolish; she knew Zhou Ziyang was trying to profit from the situation. Though she was at Initial Soul Formation, this young man clearly wasn't an easy opponent.

Plus, the people behind Luo Tian also radiated powerful fluctuations. Though their cultivation was slightly lower than hers, Jiang Lerong understood that at this level, a genius could easily surpass an entire cultivation stage.

Realizing this, Jiang Lerong hesitated. She couldn't bear to abandon her revenge against Luo Tian; the entire Jiang family had been destroyed by him, and her father was still recovering in Qionghua Sect. Jiang Lerong had placed Luo Tian on her list of people to kill.

Jiang Lerong's eyes flickered, and she whispered to her attendant, her gaze playful as she looked at Luo Tian.

"Hmph, Luo Tian of the Five Elements Sect, I challenge you to a duel to settle our grudge from earlier!" The attendant received Jiang Lerong's mental message, her face lighting up with joy.

She had been bitter about being defeated by Luo Tian before and now had the chance to settle it—how could she miss it?

"Uh?" Hearing the attendant's words, Luo Tian and others' faces darkened. Their eyes flashed with anger toward Jiang Lerong.

Zhou Ziyang nodded, silently praising Jiang Lerong's cleverness. Everyone could feel that this Luo Tian was currently a commoner; the people here would easily crush him. Jiang Lerong had sent an attendant to challenge Luo Tian, and if he accepted, it would lower his dignity. If he refused, it would be even more humiliating.

"You're what? Daring to challenge Luo Tian?" Dong Sansi stepped forward, his black sword radiating dark energy. His eyes were cold as he looked at the attendant.

"I challenge Luo Tian! Where was your boldness before? Now you've become a coward!" The attendant grew bolder.

"Challenging me, usually ends badly—lightly, your cultivation is ruined; heavily, you lose your life. This isn't as simple as being broken leg before!" Luo Tian stepped out from behind Dong Sansi, not looking at the attendant but gazing at Jiang Lerong.

"Life and death are fate!" Jiang Lerong spoke, her eyes playful.

"Fearful? Fearful! Next time I meet you, kneel and shout three times 'auntie' to show your submission!" The attendant seemed certain Luo Tian wouldn't accept, shouting taunts.

"Calling names?" Xu Liyi sneered, stepping forward to scold Luo Tian but stopped when he heard Luo Tian's cold voice.

"Fine, I accept your challenge. Hope you don't regret it!" Luo Tian stood on the dragon's back, a smile on his face.

Chapter 585: Truly Unconcerned

Luo Tian's calm voice echoed, and he stood there without any aura. Yet this cold gaze made the attendant shiver involuntarily, her eyes filled with disbelief.

"What did you say?" The attendant's mouth opened, looking at Luo Tian as if she had heard wrong.

"I accept your challenge. A Bone-Subjugation peak—what's there to fear?" Luo Tian stepped forward to the dragon's front.

Xu Liyi, who had intended to curse Luo Tian, stopped himself upon hearing his words. He almost choked, his face equally shocked.

"Junior Brother, don't!" Lei Yong and Ji Chen's faces showed anxiety as they called out to Luo Tian. They didn't believe Luo Tian had any means left to defeat a Bone-Subjugation peak.

Others also tried to stop him, but Luo Tian refused each one with a calm gaze before smiling again at the attendant and Jiang Lerong.

Jiang Lerong and her people were stunned by Luo Tian's words, then laughed lightly, their voices flowing like water: "Brave spirit! Brother Luo's courage truly impresses me!"

"Haha, truly no disgrace for the Five Elements Sect's genius!" Jiang Lerong's women laughed together.

"Since you're so eager to die, then I have no choice!" The attendant's face lit up with excitement, her entire body trembling.

Luo Tian, the genius of the Northern Region, had been rising in fame recently. Rumors claimed even Ice Island's genius Luo Han was defeated by him. Now this brilliant genius would die at her hands, and she would surely gain fame.

"Enough talk. Let's start!" Luo Tian spoke softly, standing atop the dragon with a calm gaze.

Luo Tian had met countless people in recent years; this Bone-Subjugation peak was nothing to him.

"Since you're so eager to die, then I have no choice!" The attendant sneered, and a pair of golden wings suddenly sprouted from her back. They gleamed with metallic luster, their sharpness sending chills down people's spines.

"Extreme Light Wings! Jiang Sister, you truly favor your attendant—such a rare treasure as Extreme Light Wings could be given to a servant!" Luo Tian smiled at Jiang Lerong.

"Enough talk. Say your last words quickly!" The attendant shouted, her eyes filled with excitement as she spread the Extreme Light Wings and flew into the sky alone.

"Luo Tian! Make the dragon steady!" Dragon Baby had repeatedly emphasized he had a name, but Luo Tian still often called him by mistake. He instructed Dragon Baby to steady the dragon before his eyes flashed like lightning, gazing at the attendant approaching him.

The attendant's eyes were filled with excitement as she flew toward Luo Tian, sensing his current weak state. She could end his life with a single palm strike.

But then, she saw Luo Tian's gaze and her face turned pale. Her vision showed Luo Tian's aura rapidly rising, reaching the Yuan Ling stage within moments and continuing to grow.

"Yuan Ling Initial Stage... Soul Formation Initial Stage... Spirit Formation Initial Stage..." Luo Tian's aura reached the Spirit Formation Mid-Stage before stopping. His entire figure seemed ethereal in people's eyes.

"This..." Jiang Lerong and Zhou Ziyang were stunned, their gazes on Luo Tian's aura, speechless for a moment.

Spirit Formation—those who reached this stage were the top-tier talents of the Tianyuan Continent. Even if they died, there was a chance for their residual soul to regenerate.

"Impossible! How old is he? How can he be a Spirit Formation master!" Everyone's faces showed disbelief.

The attendant, flying mid-air, felt the aura of Spirit Formation and stopped, her face pale as she looked at Luo Tian. Her body was paralyzed with sweat flowing down.

Under people's stunned gazes, Luo Tian's hands moved slightly, his eyes filled with coldness.

But to the onlookers, this movement seemed to contain the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Though it appeared slow, it made Zhou Ziyang's group even more terrified.

If Luo Tian knew what people were thinking, he would curse: "I'm not trying to be slow—I just don't have spiritual energy and my body is too fragile!"

Luo Tian moved slowly, finally forming the Soul-Stealing Seal in his hands. He had no spiritual energy now, only his spirit; thus, the only technique he could use was the Soul-Stealing Seal. And it took great effort to perform.

"Buzz..." An invisible wave spread through everyone's spiritual senses, causing them to blink slightly. Then Jiang Lerong suddenly shouted: "It's fake! He only has aura!"

Hearing Jiang Lerong's shout, the attendant shook her head but felt no desire to resist.

The attendant couldn't sense the Soul-Stealing Seal, but others could. Jiang Lerong saw the attendant still dazed and sneered, rushing toward her with a fist.

"What are you doing?" A cold voice carried an overwhelming superior's pressure, blocking Jiang Lerong's path.

"Move..." Jiang Lerong sneered and launched a fist toward Long Jie.

"You're not worthy!" Long Jie chuckled, facing a Soul Formation master without fear. Golden light suddenly flared from his fist, illuminating the sky and colliding with Jiang Lerong's fist.

The collision echoed like a thunderous explosion, cracks in the void spreading from their fists.

Lei Yong and others quickly shielded Luo Tian, while Luo Tian's Soul-Stealing Seal had already struck the motionless attendant's head.

"Crack..." A light sound, and the attendant let out a piercing scream before falling to the ground.

"Go..." Luo Tian didn't intend to let her go, and a green flame flew from his hands, forming a green dragon that wrapped around the attendant.

"Ah..." The attendant screamed again and was instantly reduced to ashes by the terrifying temperature of the Jade Crystal琉璃 Fire, scattering into the air.

Chapter 586: Sense of Crisis

The ashes drifted with the wind, and the green flame returned to Luo Tian's front, wrapping around a pair of golden wings.

"Ah..." Seeing her attendant killed, Jiang Lerong became疯狂, spiritual energy surging as she glared at Luo Tian with cold eyes.

"Flowers Bloom in the World!" Jiang Lerong's red eyes flared, her hands spread as spiritual energy of the wood element surged from her body. Green mist flowed in all directions, and she roared as countless seeds flew out of her hands.

Countless seeds, like arrows, flew toward the people around them.

"Bad! This woman's gone mad!" Zhou Ziyang's face turned serious as white spiritual energy surged, protecting himself and his companions.

"Damn!" Xu Liyi cursed, while Lei Yong's group showed strong apprehension toward the countless seeds. They gathered around Luo Tian to shield him.

"Jade Crystal琉璃 Fire!" Luo Tian roared, and the green flame flew from his hands, enveloping everyone.

"Move..." Long Jie roared, emitting strange waves from his mouth, accompanied by a thunderous dragon roar. A red dragon breath followed.

"Crack crack crack..." As if fireworks were lit, the seeds pierced through Long Jie's dragon breath and struck the Jade Crystal琉璃 Fire.

With Long Jie's barrier, the seeds' power was almost exhausted and burned by the Jade Crystal琉璃 Fire.

Zhou Ziyang's side, like a cloud, allowed the seeds to hit it as if they were cotton, their power dissipating.

Long Jie's face showed annoyance, feeling it was unseemly to have failed to fully block Jiang Lerong's attack. His body radiated waves, golden light flashing.

"Jiang Lerong, have you gone mad? You're attacking us too!" Zhou Ziyang's face showed anger.

"Move..." Jiang Lerong sneered, her fist striking. "You're meddling in something that's none of your business! If you insist on interfering, I'll fight to the end!" Jiang Lerong's heart was bleeding.

Her attendant had accompanied her for years, and they were like sisters. Now that her sister was killed, it hurt more than when Luo Tian had destroyed her family. Jiang Lerong no longer cared about Zhou Ziyang's watchful gaze and focused solely on killing Luo Tian.

Jiang Lerong knew this was the best chance to kill Luo Tian; if he recovered, it would be difficult.

"Roar..." A golden dragon instantly filled the sky with gold light, a hundred-foot-long dragon appearing in people's view.

"Roar..." The dragons beneath Luo Tian's group had glowing eyes, roaring at the hundred-foot-long golden dragon as if paying homage to their king.

"Is this Long Jie? Dragon Baby?" Lei Yong and others showed disbelief, looking at the transformed Long Jie.

Even Luo Tian was shocked; he had seen Dragon Baby's true form before, which was only several feet long. Now it had grown to an astonishing hundred feet.

"Dragon Clan?" Zhou Ziyang's eyes showed admiration as he looked at Long Jie in dragon form.

"Even if it's a Dragon Clan, it's still an immature one!" Jiang Lerong said this but her eyes showed caution.

A royal aura radiated from Long Jie's massive dragon body, his golden eyes flashing with coldness. The golden dragon aura swept toward Jiang Lerong.

"Move..." Jiang Lerong roared, her slender fist unleashing terrifying power with green energy swirling around it. It collided with the golden dragon's tail.

"Boom..." The collision caused half of the void to collapse.

In moments, black void appeared before everyone's eyes, causing a shudder of fear.

Jiang Lerong then disappeared from the spot in front of people's stunned gazes, appearing ten thousand feet away. Her face was pale.

"Challenging a dragon clan with your body—this is suicide!" Lei Yong sighed, watching the golden dragon unscathed.

Hearing Lei Yong's words, Chen Zhanbiao and Xu Liyi blushed. They had previously clashed with Dragon Baby's body, and now Lei Yong's words made them feel embarrassed.

"Truly strong—able to withstand a Soul Formation master's attack. This dragon clan isn't ordinary; it even carries a royal aura."

"Roar..." As if releasing his frustration, Long Jie roared again, his hundred-foot-long body rolling in the sky and streaking toward Jiang Lerong.

"I don't believe I can't defeat you! Today, all of you must die!" Jiang Lerong's hands moved swiftly, spiritual energy gathering. The wood element spiritual energy within a hundred-mile radius was instantly drained.

A green lotus-shaped martial technique formed in Jiang Lerong's hands, its size only dozens of feet. Yet each petal was inscribed with dense text, radiating an aura capable of destroying everything. This aura spread into people's hearts.

As the lotus was formed, Long Jie's golden eyes turned serious. He could confirm that this terrifying lotus would definitely destroy him if it struck his body, even with his formidable body comparable to a Soul Formation master.

Soul Formation masters could use techniques that borrowed a bit of the world's power. The inviolable rule was that this was the essential difference between Soul Formation and Yuan Ling masters.

But just as Jiang Lerong prepared to launch the lotus toward Long Jie, a terrifying sense of crisis suddenly invaded her heart. It felt as if she were being locked onto, causing her to pause slightly.

An invisible opportunity formed in Jiang Lerong's heart. Though she didn't know who was hiding in the shadows, she had a feeling that if she launched her lotus technique now, she would immediately face a storm of attacks and risk her life.
