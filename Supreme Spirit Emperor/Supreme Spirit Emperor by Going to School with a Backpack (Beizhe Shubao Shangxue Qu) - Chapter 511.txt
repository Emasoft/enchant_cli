Luo Tian's eyes revealed sorrow, his bleeding wrist pressed against Gu Qianxue's lips as he whispered, “Live! You must live!”

After speaking, Luo Tian's eyes rolled upward, collapsing beside Gu Qianxue.

Luo Tian had overexerted himself, his blood nearly drained from saving Gu Qianxue. His survival had relied solely on willpower, a miracle indeed.

The wind and sand swirled, leaving Luo Tian, Gu Qianxue, and a corpse long dead lying there.

Gu Qianxue stirred dazedly, convinced she had dreamed for an eternity. A gentle voice echoed in her mind, and vivid images flooded her thoughts—figures from the Five Elements Sect, a towering figure on the Ascension Stairs, and a steadfast back.

Chapter 1966: Oasis in the Desert ()

Night fell, coldness swept over, and Gu Qianxue slowly opened her eyes, gazing at the boundless stars. Her gaze was bewildered before clearing abruptly.

She removed the wrist pressed against her lips, scanning her surroundings. She saw Luo Tian naked beside her, eyes flashing coldly as she kicked him.

“Thud…” Though Gu Qianxue had regained consciousness, her body remained weak; the kick failed to send him flying.

“Hmph,” Gu Qianxue rose slowly, noticing her attire, confusion flickering in her eyes.

She let out a cold snort, standing tall. Her gaze swept the area but avoided Luo Tian and the corpse, intent on finding her own way out.

Yet as she took a step, she felt blood at her lips and spotted the water flask and Luo Tian's open pack.

“Live!” The three bloodied characters in her vision shook her to the core.

“Where did his wrist injury come from?” Curiosity overtook her, her face flushing as she gazed at Luo Tian's grotesque wound, a contemplative look in her eyes.

“I was unconscious, and there were no corpses nearby!” She glanced around, nearly stripped by Luo Tian.

“He saved me!” Gu Qianxue’s intelligence clicked instantly, recalling the warm back in her dream and the spring-like energy that revived her.

Her heart trembled, as if struck by an unseen force, eyes wide with disbelief.

Gu Qianxue finally understood—after the sandstorm, Luo Tian’s condition was no better. His battered state confirmed it.

Emotion surged through her, her gaze toward Luo Tian now changed.

Blood trickled from Gu Qianxue’s lips, her body trembling violently as she spoke:

“No matter what transpired between us, your feelings for me are enough to change me. Even if my cultivation fades!”

“An invaluable treasure, a rare lover—may you never betray me in your lifetime!” Gu Qianxue whispered, her eyes resolute.

“Boom…” Waves radiated from her body, and memories flooded her mind—scenes of her past within the Nine Realms.

“I am Gu Qianxue! He is my husband, Luo Tian!” She recalled instantly, her gaze shifting to Luo Tian, the ice of her heart melting as her eyes transformed.

At the same time, her meridians began to wither, signaling the loss of all her cultivation. Without opportunity, she would never recover.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue rushed to his side, lifting his lifeless form.

“I’m sorry!” Tears welled in her eyes as she gazed at the dying Luo Tian, tenderness in her gaze.

“Stay strong! There are signs of life here—I’ll get us out! This time, let me protect you!” Her eyes hardened with determination. She took a dagger from the pack, slicing her wrist. Blood flowed, dripping into Luo Tian’s mouth.

Time passed swiftly; Gu Qianxue rose, gathering the pack and hoisting Luo Tian onto her back. She tied them together with ropes, walking through the desert under the night sky.

Gu Qianxue chose to travel at night, knowing her current state would collapse in daylight.

Coldness invaded her body, yet warmth filled her heart as she felt Luo Tian’s weight on her back.

“Though I’ve only half my memories, it’s enough!” She murmured, her frail body unleashing boundless potential.

Time drifted slowly; the night passed, and the sun rose again, its scorching heat unbearable. Especially with Luo Tian on her back.

“Rippling… rippling…” The sound of flowing water reached her ears, joy flickering in her eyes as blurred visions revealed greenery.

“Luo Tian, stay strong—help is near!” She whispered, stepping toward the hazy oasis.

But after an hour, the desert remained unchanged; no oasis appeared.

“Is it a hallucination?” Despair gripped her, her body nearly evaporating under the relentless heat.

Yet as she neared collapse, figures emerged in her vision.

“Big brother!” A thunderous voice echoed, lighting Gu Qianxue’s face with joy. Her eyes rolled back as she collapsed beside Luo Tian.

Figures moved; three silhouettes appeared before Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue—Sun Kainian, Chen Zhanbiao, and Sima Tuo.

“Quickly, save him!” Diao Dedu stood on Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulders, shouting at the three.

Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo pressed their hands to Luo Tian’s body, spiritual energy surging into him. But when Sima Tuo attempted to channel it into Gu Qianxue, Sun Kainian stopped him.

“Impossible—her meridians are damaged; she cannot withstand spiritual energy!” Sun Kainian’s expression darkened. He draped a robe over Luo Tian, signaling Chen Zhanbiao to carry him. Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo lifted Gu Qianxue, returning along the path they’d come.

…

“Hiss…”

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, gazing at a simple roof.

“Where am I? Qianxue!” He leapt up, his wounds partially healed, spiritual energy coursing through him.

“Big brother, you’re awake!” Chen Zhanbiao stood before him, concern in his eyes.

“Zhanbiao!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit with joy at seeing him, surprised to meet him.

“Where is your wife?” Luo Tian immediately thought of Gu Qianxue, wondering about her condition during his unconsciousness.

“She’s fine… but…” Chen Zhanbiao hesitated, unsure how to proceed, causing Luo Tian’s expression to shift.

“Take me to her!” Luo Tian rose, stepping toward the slightly dilapidated room.

He pushed open the door and saw Sun Kainian, Sima Tuo, and Diao Dedu perched on Sun Kainian’s shoulder. Relief washed over him.

“I said he’d wake within three days!” Sun Kainian laughed, glancing at Sima Tuo.

“Insane—after such injuries, his core nearly drained—he recovered this fast!” Sima Tuo stared at Luo Tian as if he were a monster.

“Blood葬 Brothers, so you’re Luo Tian!” A youth stood behind them, his face refined. Luo Tian didn’t recognize him but recognized the voice.

“Ran Hao!” He suddenly recalled where he’d heard that voice, gazing at the youth.

“Qianxue’s condition?” Luo Tian asked Diao Dedu and Sun Kainian, scanning the surroundings. The environment puzzled him—this wasn’t the Sand Sea Royal City; it was rich with spiritual energy and lush plants, serene.

“This isn’t the Sand Sea Royal City; we’re still in the Death Desert.”

“She’s fine, but… her cultivation is gone,” Sun Kainian replied.

They led Luo Tian to a room door, opening it to reveal a burly figure wiping Gu Qianxue’s face with a damp towel.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow, recognizing the man as male. Though likely their savior, the intimacy unsettled him.

“Luo Tian, long time no see! How come you look so pitiful?” The burly figure turned, his arrogant voice stunning Luo Tian.

Short hair, a clean face, high cheekbones that made blood rush, a smile on his face—his gaze met Luo Tian.

“You…”

“Meng… Meng… Meng Xue…” Luo Tian stammered, stunned to meet an old acquaintance—Huoyu, the daughter of Fire Lord Meng.

“Surprised? Delighted?” Meng Xue maintained her bold demeanor, tossing the towel into a basin. She approached Luo Tian, clapping his shoulder like a man.

“Too unexpected…” Luo Tian stared at her, murmuring.

“First check on your precious wife, then chat!” Meng Xue laughed, glancing at Gu Qianxue in bed.

“Okay,” Luo Tian nodded, approaching the bedside, worry etched on his face.

He extended his spiritual awareness, scanning Gu Qianxue’s condition. His brow furrowed.

“Her cultivation is gone? There’s a fire toxin in her body!” He quickly understood her state.

“Correct. A commoner enduring the Death Desert without spiritual energy protection would contract fire toxin. We found her weak, carrying you—this commoner made it here; her willpower is astonishing!”

“But her body has changed. We dared not use spiritual energy to purge the toxin. Now it’s up to you—medicine is the best option!” Sun Kainian explained.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, gazing at Gu Qianxue’s pale face. He knew his acupuncture skills and wouldn’t let her suffer a bit.

Chapter 1967: Fire Lord ()

“Must succeed!” Luo Tian gazed at Gu Qianxue in bed, retrieving silver needles. His face was solemn as he pressed them into her body.

“Buzz…” The needles shimmered, Luo Tian’s hands moving swiftly, each needle landing on Gu Qianxue. Heat radiated from her body, swirling around her.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled, his slight mistakes were far better than before. He hadn’t concentrated this intensely in a long time.

“Come out!” Luo Tian grabbed, absorbing the fire toxin from Gu Qianxue’s meridians into his palm.

After half a moment, the searing energy in his hand exploded, earning a smile from Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue whispered, her long lashes fluttering before opening her eyes. She saw Luo Tian’s concerned gaze.

“How are you? Better?” Luo Tian spoke softly, longing to embrace her but hesitating—was she still the old self?

“Hmm, better,” Gu Qianxue saw Luo Tian’s expression and knew he still thought she was the previous version.

“Idiot!” Gu Qianxue rose, hugging Luo Tian tightly, her eyes tender as she pressed her cheek against his chest.

“You’ve suffered a lot,” she whispered, lifting her face to gaze at him.

“Qianxue, you…” Luo Tian stared at her, joy in his eyes—how long had it been since she was so proactive? How could he not be thrilled?

“Heaven has eyes!” Luo Tian longed to shout, but gently held her, his eyes soft as he kissed her…

An hour later, Luo Tian rose, smiling, exiting the room. Gu Qianxue was still weak; he hadn’t done anything beyond marital duties.

During that hour, Luo Tian learned Gu Qianxue’s past—how she ascended from the Nine Realms to the Immortal Realm.

Gu Qianxue had once been gifted with an opportunity, ascending not to the Lower Three Heavens but directly into the Upper Three Heavens, joining the Ghost King Sect.

The Ghost King Sect was ruthless; as a newly ascended immortal, she wasn’t even at the Heavenly Dao stage. Her journey was arduous. Yet luck struck—she obtained a relic from the sect’s great power, Lord of Split Soul.

Mastering the Split Soul Art allowed her to divide into two individuals, each training independently. Upon fusion, her strength surged.

This method was too unconventional, but it demanded a price: losing memories and becoming another person. To regain them, her cultivation would vanish.

Gu Qianxue had hesitated but chose to train when faced with a crisis. However, during training, both entities developed their own wills—one being the current Ghost Queen Gu Qianxue, the other still in the Ghost King Sect.

The two entities fought for dominance, and Gu Qianxue had escaped the sect, defeating her other self. Otherwise, she would’ve been consumed.

“Now I’m a commoner with memories! You must make the other me fall in love, restore half my memory, and let us fuse again—only then will I be whole!” Luo Tian recalled Gu Qianxue’s words, marveling at her ordeal.

Yet he felt odd—finding the other Gu Qianxue and winning her over again.

“Regardless, knowing this is good news!” Luo Tian stepped toward Diao Dedu and the others.

“How was it?” Seeing Luo Tian’s prolonged exit, Sun Kainian and others wore mischievous smiles.

“Smoothly!” Luo Tian replied softly, then glanced around, confusion in his eyes before asking: “Where are we? Why are you all fine?”

“Also, Ran Hao and Meng Xue—how did you get here?” Luo Tian’s eyes were full of questions.

“One at a time! I was blown here by the sandstorm, then met Meng Xue who saved me. Then I used my nose to find Sun Kainian and Sima Tuo nearby!” Diao Dedu explained.

“As for me, I was directly transported here after passing the first trial!” Ran Hao’s refined face showed embarrassment as he explained.

Everyone turned to Meng Xue, puzzled—this was the Death Desert, yet the environment didn’t match.

“This is an oasis, my home—my father’s retreat!” Meng Xue smiled, answering.

“Your father! Fire Lord Meng Wushuang?” Hearing this, Luo Tian and Sun Kainian’s faces changed.

Among the Nine Realms, only Fire Lord was known as an Epoch Lord; people naturally knew his name.

“Correct. This is the only oasis in the desert, where my father has lived for years!”

“He found me through bloodline power when I first arrived in the Immortal Realm, bringing me here!” Meng Xue explained.

“Where is Fire Lord? The Epoch Lord! My heavens!” Sun Kainian shouted, having met the Thief of Heaven but not as renowned as Fire Lord or others.

“He left a few days ago, saying there was a battle in the desert—he’d check it out. He hasn’t returned yet!” Meng Xue frowned, concern in her eyes.

“By the way, Meng Xue, what’s Fire Lord’s cultivation?” Sun Kainian’s eyes gleamed with anticipation, gazing at Meng Xue.

“Early-stage Immortal King.” Meng Xue replied, causing Luo Tian and others to gasp.

“Early-stage Immortal King! My heavens, we finally have an early-stage Immortal King as our ally!” Sun Kainian and Diao Dedu laughed, acting like their father was Fire Lord.

“You two are really shameless!” Sima Tuo blushed, watching them.

“Do you even know what we mean? We’re comrades through life and death!” Sun Kainian patted Meng Xue’s shoulder proudly.

“Exactly! Meng Xue’s father is my father, the same!” Diao Dedu stood straight, shouting.

“Who’s your father! I don’t have a Diao son!” Before Diao Dedu finished, a commanding voice echoed in their ears. A red cloud appeared above, and an invisible pressure descended, making Luo Tian’s group pale.

Red robes shimmered; a middle-aged man stood in the sky, his eyes stern. His presence made the world and earth differ—Luo Tian’s group gazed up, sensing an ancient aura. His eyes seemed to pierce all things.

At the man’s arrival, the entire courtyard and oasis plants trembled as if welcoming him.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian’s third eye flame mark flickered, emitting longing waves.

“Father!” Meng Xue ran to the man.

“It’s indeed Fire Lord!” Though they’d suspected, their eyes were still thrilled—this was Fire Lord, a legendary figure in the Nine Realms.

Though Luo Tian had become an Epoch Lord and was more famous than Fire Lord, the feeling was different. Meng Wushuang’s current cultivation as early-stage Immortal King still outpaced Luo Tian’s group.

“Who let strangers in?” Meng Wushuang frowned, his face unamused.

“This is the Luo Tian I told you about!” Meng Xue shouted, pointing at Luo Tian and introducing Sun Kainian, Chen Zhanbiao, etc.

“You’re Luo Tian?” Hearing this, Meng Wushuang’s face didn’t brighten but darkened further.

“Luo Tian, you took my flame but didn’t marry my daughter!”

“My daughter isn’t good enough for you?” Meng Wushuang roared, his body like a lit fuse, pressure sweeping the world.

“Rippling…” The oasis’s creatures and plants erupted with fury, shaking violently.

“Crack…” Cold sweat poured from Luo Tian’s face; his legs trembled, nearly collapsing. Yet his body emitted cracking sounds.

“Respectfully, I already have a wife. Please don’t trouble me!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Fire Lord Meng Wushuang.

“Your talent is good, but your character disgusts me. Without strength, you act like this—I dislike it!” Fire Lord spoke, his voice mocking.

“One last chance—marry my daughter!” Meng Wushuang coldly ordered, seeing Meng Xue’s anxiety.

Chapter 1968: Stay ()

Fire Lord Meng Wushuang’s voice was dominant, pressing with immense power and refusal. Each word echoed like thunder in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Back then, I prepared a human flame as my daughter’s dowry.”

“Now, I prepare the entire Sand Sea Royal City!” Fire Lord Meng Wushuang declared, gazing at Luo Tian.

“The entire Sand Sea Royal City!” Hearing this, Sun Kainian’s group turned pale, surprise in their eyes.

As an Immortal King, they had no doubt the Sand Sea Royal City belonged to Fire Lord Meng Wushuang. Yet they hadn’t expected him to gift the entire city as Meng Xue’s dowry.

“Buzz…” After speaking, Fire Lord Meng Wushuang extended his hand; Luo Tian’s third eye flame mark jumped violently. The seven-colored flames fell into Meng Wushuang’s palm.

“Xiaoqi!” Luo Tian roared, seeing Xiaoqi’s form in the flames. His eyes turned red.

Xiaoqi had followed Luo Tian for thousands of years, evolving from the Jade Crystal Flame to merging with Fire Sect’s flames. Luo Tian had regarded it as his child.

“This was originally mine!” Meng Wushuang coldly spoke, pointing a finger; the seven-colored flames trembled violently in his palm. Xiaoqi’s form screamed in pain within.

“He’s erasing Xiaoqi’s consciousness!” Luo Tian’s eyes bloodshot, his heart aching as he gazed at Xiaoqi’s cries.

“Fire Lord!”

“Father…” Sun Kainian and Meng Xue shouted, stunned by Meng Wushuang’s intense hatred toward Luo Tian.

“Father! Luo Tian once saved the Nine Realms, my life!” Meng Xue shouted, knowing her father’s fiery temper.

“Elder,” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, eyes red, resisting Fire Lord’s pressure. He stood tall, gazing at Meng Wushuang.

“You can reclaim the flame, but please preserve Xiaoqi’s consciousness.”

“If you erase Xiaoqi, I swear to make you pay. Though you became an Epoch Lord before me and entered the Immortal Realm, one day I will avenge this!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed madness, his gaze icy as he stared at Meng Wushuang.

“Luo Tian, don’t be like this—show some humility!” Meng Xue’s face changed.

“Do you threaten me?” Meng Wushuang’s eyes flashed danger, gazing at Luo Tian standing up.

“I despise being threatened. If you lack strength yet dare threaten me, I’ll grant your wish!” Meng Wushuang coldly spoke.

“Buzz…” Invisible waves swept over, darkening the sky. Clouds gathered, forming a world that enveloped Luo Tian’s group.

“Domain! Another domain!” Recognizing the supreme aura, Sun Kainian’s group turned pale.

“I’ll ask you once more—my daughter, marry or not? If not, today all of you die. You’ve enraged me!” Meng Wushuang shouted, like a god descending.

“Not marry!” Before Luo Tian could speak, Gu Qianxue’s weak form emerged from the old room. Her pale face was resolute.

“Elder, we’re all from the Nine Realms. We are your juniors; our friendship with your daughter is life-or-death. Is this appropriate? Our master is the Thief of Heaven!”

“Luo Tian is a disciple of the Cut-Heaven Lord. You don’t fear retaliation from those behind us?” Sun Kainian shouted, listing all his allies.

“What does it matter? Even if the Cut-Heaven Lord himself came, I’d still be fearless!” Hearing this, Meng Wushuang didn’t soften but grew angrier, gazing at Sun Kainian.

“Damn…” Meng Wushuang’s gaze made Sun Kainian shiver, rushing behind Meng Xue.

“Father, they’re my friends! If you want to kill them, kill me too!” Meng Xue’s fiery temper stood before Luo Tian’s group.

“Stupid girl, get out of the way!” Meng Wushuang waved his hand; flames surged, forming a fire dragon that wrapped around Meng Xue, throwing her aside.

“Father, don’t force me!” Meng Xue struggled violently, determination and death intent radiating from her.

“You!” Seeing Meng Xue’s death intent, Meng Wushuang’s face changed. He glanced at Luo Tian’s resolve.

“Ha… ha…”

“You foolish girl, for these people, you defy your father!” Meng Wushuang laughed, voice filled with helplessness. The clouds above dispersed; the fire dragon around Meng Xue collapsed, and the pressure over Luo Tian’s group vanished.

Luo Tian’s group was stunned, watching Meng Wushuang, unsure of his plan. He’d just been fierce and now laughed heartily.

“Buzz…” Waves emerged from Meng Wushuang’s hands, a golden dragon flying out.

“Roar…” Dragon power surged; the roar echoed, making Luo Tian’s group tense.

“This is the gift from Dragon Sparrow Elder. He has matters to attend; after finishing, he’ll find you!” Meng Wushuang told Luo Tian, satisfaction in his eyes.

“Dragon sinew!” Sun Kainian gasped, forgetting Meng Wushuang’s terror, drooling at the golden dragon in the sky.

“This…” Luo Tian was stunned; the contrast was too great.

“Still standing? Take it!”

“Dragon Sparrow Elder told me to relay: when in trouble, don’t be foolish. Life is most important; don’t lose it over trivial matters!” Meng Wushuang added.

“I understand!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed gratitude, grabbing the golden dragon sinew. A scorching energy enveloped his body.

“Alright, recover your injuries quickly and leave!” Meng Wushuang snorted, pointing a finger. The seven-colored mark was imprinted on Luo Tian’s forehead. Then he vanished from their sight.

“Huff…” As Meng Wushuang left, Luo Tian’s group collapsed to the ground, panting.

“Terrifying! An Immortal King is this terrifying!” Sima Tuo was shaken, relief in his eyes. If Meng Wushuang had truly killed them, they’d have no chance to fight back.

“Without Dragon Sparrow Elder, Fire Lord wouldn’t kill me, but would’ve troubled me!” Luo Tian thought.

Meng Wushuang’s actions were clearly a warning, telling him he was wrong before—life is most important. As long as one lives, there’s hope.

Yet Luo Tian shook his head; he knew life was most important, but some things were more vital.

“Indeed a promising candidate!” As Luo Tian’s eyes showed resolve, Meng Wushuang’s gaze held admiration.

“Alright, no harm done. Fire Lord is an elder; we’re all from the Nine Realms. We are Meng Xue’s friends, so they wouldn’t kill us!” Luo Tian told the group.

After speaking, he supported Gu Qianxue toward the room. Meng Wushuang’s antics had exhausted them; Gu Qianxue, now a commoner, would’ve collapsed without Luo Tian’s protection.

Time drifted slowly; the group stayed in the oasis for seven days. Luo Tian’s injuries fully healed, and Gu Qianxue, though a commoner, was healthier than ordinary humans due to the oasis’s rich spiritual energy.

“Lifespan!” Luo Tian sat, worry in his eyes. Though Gu Qianxue was fine now, he thought of a serious problem—her becoming a commoner. A human’s lifespan was at most a hundred years; in spiritual energy-rich areas, it was up to 150 years. For Luo Tian, this wasn’t enough.

A hundred and fifty years—when a cultivator closed himself for long, it would pass quickly. Luo Tian didn’t want Gu Qianxue to live only 150 years.

Moreover, Gu Qianxue was incomplete; she needed to fuse with the other Ghost King Sect’s Gu Qianxue to be whole.

“Don’t worry; we have a connection. She’ll sense my current state, know what’s happening, and come to fuse with me!” Gu Qianxue spoke softly.

“You should stay here; I’ll visit Fire Lord. Your current state isn’t fit for travel—stay safe!” Luo Tian spoke softly, voice filled with reluctance.

“Okay, I’ll wait for you.”

“And be careful—the other me is like me before. She might even be more ruthless. I can sense she’s entered True Immortal!” Gu Qianxue nodded gently.

“I’ll visit Meng Elder!” Luo Tian stood, heading to Meng Wushuang’s residence.

The oasis wasn’t large, about ten thousand feet in range. It had only been home to Meng Xue and Meng Wushuang before. Soon, Luo Tian reached Meng Wushuang’s residence.

“Going to leave?” As Luo Tian stood outside the courtyard, Meng Wushuang’s domineering voice echoed. Though he hadn’t harmed Luo Tian, he still disliked him.

After all, any parent sees their child as the best. Luo Tian had rejected Meng Xue’s marriage proposal; anyone would be upset, especially a Fire Lord.

Chapter 1969: Take You to Pretend ()

“Elder, I have a request. My wife Gu Qianxue has become a commoner; I beg you to let her stay!” Luo Tian stood outside the courtyard, bowing.

“I know you have a grudge against me, but please consider we’re all from the Nine Realms. Help me!” Luo Tian didn’t wait for Meng Wushuang’s reply, speaking again.

“Go! I’m who I am—letting her stay here, what can I do to her? Besides, this girl is my descendant!” Meng Wushuang sighed.

“Descendant?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion.

“My wife, she was surnamed Gu, but she passed away!” A nostalgic voice echoed, filled with helplessness and sighs.

“Thank you, Elder!” Luo Tian’s body trembled slightly before bowing respectfully. He knew some things and people, even across an epoch, couldn’t be forgotten.

With Meng Wushuang’s assurance, Luo Tian relaxed, his face respectful as he retreated to his residence.

“You’re different from us,” Meng Wushuang gazed at Luo Tian’s departure, whispering.

In the courtyard, the group sat waiting for Luo Tian. Seeing him arrive, Sun Kainian shouted: “Did you get it? If so, we’ll leave quickly—this place is too boring!”

“Yeah, we’ll go tomorrow morning,” Luo Tian nodded, speaking to the group with reluctance.

“Okay, meet here tomorrow!” Knowing Luo Tian had something to say to Gu Qianxue, they all stood up.

Seeing them leave, Luo Tian’s face softened. He opened the door, seeing Gu Qianxue sitting at the table.

“Leave tomorrow?” Gu Qianxue whispered, her eyes filled with reluctance and deep affection toward Luo Tian.

“Yeah, leave tomorrow. Stay behind,” he said.

“I’ll find the other you and bring her back to fuse with you!” Luo Tian tried to sound casual.

One night passed; at dawn, Luo Tian dressed, kissed Gu Qianxue’s ear, and prepared breakfast on the table. He stepped out of the courtyard.

The oasis had a small teleportation array, directly connecting to the Sand Sea Royal City. Luo Tian’s group stood on it, excitement in their eyes.

Though the oasis was like a normal world, the endless desert around them made them uncomfortable—after all, they’d nearly died in the Death Desert.
