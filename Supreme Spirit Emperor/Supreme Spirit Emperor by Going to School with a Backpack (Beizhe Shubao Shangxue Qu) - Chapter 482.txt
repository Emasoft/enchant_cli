Lo Tian waved several silver needles into his hand and thrust them toward Chen Zhanbiao.

"Ah..." A piercing scream echoed through the thatched hut, filled with madness and pain.

As night fell, Lo Tian wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao who had closed his eyes again, with several silver needles inserted into major acupoints.

"His blood conflict has been temporarily subdued," Lo Tian said, storing Chen Zhanbiao away with a determined look in his eyes.

"Roar..." A familiar ghostly wail rose outside the hut, but Lo Tian felt an unusual sense of safety upon hearing it.

Accompanied by the ghostly wail, Lo Tian closed his eyes and rested through the night without cultivating but instead continuously pondered what to do next, refining his thoughts.

The following morning, Lo Tian rose and headed toward Dan Peak, where he was finally noticed by someone.

"Isn't that Lo Tian? How did he return?" Everyone was puzzled, although it had been a long time, they still remembered Lo Tian and all believed he would have died.

Under the astonished gazes of people, Lo Tian stepped out from the outer gate and crossed several mountain peaks to reach Dan Peak.

"Lo Tian!" Upon his appearance, two guards at Dan Peak displayed hatred on their faces; Lo Tian had previously refused the recruitment request of Xuan Dan, causing Dan Peak people to have no good feelings toward him.

"Hello," Lo Tian ignored the hatred in their eyes and greeted them, then stepped into Dan Peak.

"Stop! What are you doing here at Dan Peak?" Upon seeing Lo Tian about to enter, the two disciples blocked him.

"Greetings to Master Xuan Dan!" Lo Tian replied softly; at that moment, he was also holding a grudge. If they caused trouble, Lo Tian would not hesitate to teach them a lesson.

"Really, there are people like you! You were expelled, yet you dare to return!"

"What a shameless person! Look at him still smiling!" One disciple after another mocked, coming close to cursing.

"Are you talking about me?" Lo Tian turned around and coldly stared at them; he had decided to give them a deep lesson.

"Who cares? This is Dan Peak, and we are not afraid of you!" The two gatekeepers showed contempt.

"Go to hell!" Without a word, Lo Tian's aura suddenly burst forth, overwhelming the two with powerful pressure. He took out the disciple token given by Xuan Dan and without hesitation, swung it to strike one of the gatekeepers in the face.

"Smack..." A crisp sound echoed, and that disciple was immediately sent flying several zhang away.

Lo Tian took a big step forward, continuously swinging the token in his hand, and his arms swung repeatedly, landing like raindrops on the young man's face.

In a short time, that disciple was beaten into a pig's head. Lo Tian shook his hands to remove the blood and grabbed the other disciple, who soon fell down as well.

However, this commotion by Lo Tian caught the attention of other Dan Peak disciples, and soon a group of elders arrived to surround him. Their eyes were filled with anger but no one dared to act upon seeing the green token in his hand.

"Lo Senior Brother, we heard you returned yesterday; why are you so angry this morning?" A young figure stepped forward from the crowd, it was Zhao Ritian.

"Haha, Senior Brother Zhao, are you surprised to see me?" Lo Tian smiled and lightly clapped his hands.

"Senior Brother Zhao, you must be fair to us! This fellow just attacked us; he's causing trouble at Dan Peak!" The two disciples beaten into pigs cried out loudly.

"Lo Senior Brother, you must give us an explanation for this," Zhao Ritian said coldly without his previous gentle demeanor, looking at Lo Tian. "Although Master Xuan Dan gave you the disciple token, you are not yet a disciple of Dan Peak. You beating our disciples is disrespecting Dan Peak; the regulations state that high-level disciples must not attack low-level ones. You should know this, right?"

"Senior Brother Zhao, how do you want to deal with me? Do you want to kill me? Previously, they wanted Zhu Youde to secretly eliminate me and send me to the Tianlong Tomb. I survived because of my luck. Then they colluded with Zhu Fenghuo to have me participate in the training."

"Although I am only an outer gate disciple, I'm not someone who can be easily pushed around. Senior Brother Zhao, if you want to deal with me, go ahead; I'll see if you have the ability!" Lo Tian coldly spoke, tearing off his mask without giving Zhao Ritian any face. He wanted to force Zhao Ritian to act.

"Is it true or fake?" The disciples of Dan Peak looked at Zhao Ritian with doubt.

"Shameless Lo Tian, how dare you defame me! I'll have you taken to Master Xuan Dan and punished for multiple offenses!" Zhao Ritian shouted, reaching out toward Lo Tian.

"Good, I was waiting for you to act!" Lo Tian sneered and took a step forward, punching Zhao Ritian.

"Crack..." In an instant, Zhao Ritian's body flew backward and he spat blood with a look of disbelief.

"Ah..." A gasp echoed from the crowd, all eyes on Zhao Ritian, surprised that he had been sent flying by Lo Tian. Who was Zhao Ritian? The fourth-ranked in the Tianlong Ranking.

"Boom..." Only when Zhao Ritian's body fell in a messy way did people realize that it was indeed Zhao Ritian.

"Want to catch me? Do you have those claws?" Lo Tian sneered, standing like a mountain on Zhao Ritian's body and swinging his palm again.

"Smack... Smack... Smack..." The crisp sound of slaps echoed again, and everyone's faces were filled with disbelief as they watched Lo Tian beating Zhao Ritian.

"They are really daring to hit!" Everyone was furious, but they dared not stop Lo Tian because he held Xuan Dan's token.

"Who are you?" Just as Lo Tian was beating Zhao Ritian, a voice of an old man echoed from outside the crowd. People immediately showed respect.

"Respect to the Peak Leader!" Everyone spoke respectfully, addressing Xuan Dan in white robes.

Chapter 1863: Daring ()

"Ah..." Lo Tian sighed deeply, looking at Zhao Ritian's blood-stained face with a slight smile. He turned his gaze toward Xuan Dan.

"Why did you come?" Xuan Dan's eyebrows slightly furrowed, looking at Lo Tian with curiosity about why he had returned.

"Of course, to fulfill my promise!" Lo Tian spoke softly; at this moment, his arrogance had vanished. Although薛 Changshan hadn't explicitly pointed it out, Lo Tian knew there was a rift between them. At this moment, his strength needed to find a patron, and Xuan Dan was the best choice. Regardless of what Xuan Dan thought, Lo Tian needed to use Xuan Dan's name.

Moreover, there were many alchemists on Dan Peak and various pharmacopoeias; Lo Tian wanted to see if he could find a way to remove the restrictions in his body and also methods to help Chen Zhanbiao resolve his blood conflict.

"Haha, it seems you are confident! There's still a little time left; are you sure?" Xuan Dan smiled.

"Yes!" Lo Tian nodded slightly, obviously confident in alchemy.

"Good!"

"Three days later, Dan Peak will hold a Dan Competition; any disciple of Tianlong Sect can participate. Whoever wins first place, I, Xuan Dan, will personally take them as my disciple and pass on all my knowledge!" Xuan Dan nodded and his aged voice echoed throughout the Tianlong Sect, causing a stir.

"Old Xuan Dan is finally going to recruit disciples!" The elders of various peaks looked surprised.

"Haha, Master Xuan Dan is recruiting disciples; I've finally waited for this day!"

"I'll definitely win first place!" The entire Tianlong Sect, whether outer or inner gate disciples, those with some fame in alchemy were all excited. Who was Xuan Dan? The most respected elder of the Tianlong Sect, only taking one disciple. Everyone knew what this meant.

The elders and disciples of the peak could compete for the next sect leader, and if they failed to become leader, they could still be peak leaders. Their status was only slightly lower than the sect leader. Becoming Xuan Dan's disciple could definitely make one a peak leader of Dan Peak.

All the alchemists in the Tianlong Sect were eager to act, their eyes filled with passion as they looked toward Dan Peak, hoping for a sudden rise.

"I'll come back three days later!" Lo Tian bowed to Xuan Dan and then looked at Zhao Ritian before leaving the outer gate.

"Kid, being bold is good, but if you're too bold, you'll get into trouble eventually!" Xuan Dan spoke to Lo Tian and then walked back toward Dan Peak.

"Senior Brother Zhao, are you okay?" After Xuan Dan and Lo Tian left, people surrounded Zhao Ritian.

"I, Zhao Ritian, am not defeated; I will definitely make him suffer in the Dan Competition. Once I become Master Xuan Dan's disciple, it will be his end!" Zhao Ritian's eyes flashed with anger as he watched Lo Tian leave, shouting in his heart.

"Senior Brother Zhao will definitely win first place and become Master Xuan Dan's disciple!"

"Yes, with Senior Brother Zhao's alchemical skills, winning first place is definitely no problem. Then what about that bastard Lo Tian? Killing him would just be a word from Senior Brother Zhao!" Seeing Zhao Ritian's fierce look, people around him immediately started to flatter him. After all, they somewhat recognized Zhao Ritian's alchemical skills.

"First, help me go rest; once I become Master Xuan Dan's disciple, I'll settle this score later!" Zhao Ritian said and staggered as he walked toward Dan Peak.

However, Zhao Ritian was also impressed by Lo Tian's strength; compared to before in the Tianlong Sect, he was completely different. Zhao Ritian felt a sharpness about Lo Tian that had never been there before.

"Did Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe really fall at his hands? Impossible! Duan Changfeng was a celestial immortal in the later stage. How could three people not kill Lo Tian? There must be something strange!" Zhao Ritian thought, his hatred for Lo Tian reaching its peak.

Lo Tian didn't stay; he directly returned to the Tianlong Tomb. Before entering the courtyard, he saw Zhu Youde anxiously waiting outside.

"Lo Tian, you've finally returned!" Zhu Youde said and grabbed Lo Tian immediately, dragging him out without saying a word.

"The Sect Leader and several elders want to see you!" Zhu Youde explained without waiting for Lo Tian's question.

"Ah..." Lo Tian nodded, not surprised at all; after such a big event, Li Changfeng and others would definitely be restless. Zhu Fenghuo, Ruan Xinghe, and Duan Changfeng hadn't returned yet. If they were dead, it would be a significant loss for the Tianlong Sect.

Zhu Youde pulled Lo Tian and flew into the air toward the head of Tianlong Mountain, where the first peak, Tianfeng, was located. It was also the mountain controlled by the Sect Leader.

A grand and imposing hall, a sense of antiquity radiated from it, obviously indicating that the Tianlong Sect had been around for quite some time.

"Enter respectfully; except for Master Xuan Dan, who doesn't concern himself with the sect's affairs, all other elders and the Sect Leader are here!" Zhu Youde repeatedly warned, fearing that Lo Tian would say something wrong and get himself in trouble.

"Yes, Grand Master, I'll handle it," Lo Tian replied and nodded, but he was thinking about how to trick Zhu Youde if possible.

"Who is trying to attack me?" Lo Tian thought, wanting to see who among these old men was secretly trying to harm him.

Otherwise, with the favor of Zuo Qiuming and Xue Changshan, Zhu Youde would definitely not dare to bother him so much. Only the elders could make Zhu Youde ignore Xue Changshan's authority and play tricks on him.

"Know your enemy, don't let them hide in the shadows; my strength is not as good as theirs. If I stay hidden, I am definitely in danger. At the moment, Xue Changshan is still my support; if I lose him, I won't live long!" Lo Tian's thoughts raced as he followed Zhu Youde into the imposing hall.

In the hall, there were about a dozen people seated, their faces showing authority. Seven old men radiated immense power, like seven statues, with eyes that glowed with a sharp light as if they could see through everything.

Behind the seven old men stood six middle-aged men, who were their disciples and now the leaders of various peaks. Zuo Qiuming stood alone, indicating his stance, representing the newly established He Peak.

"Respect to the Sect Leader and all peak leaders!" Zhu Youde was extremely nervous; although he had a decent position in the Tianlong Sect, facing these people made him feel immense pressure. His oily body was sweating uncontrollably, wetting the ground.

"Leave!" Li Changfeng frowned slightly, looking at the ground soaked with Zhu Youde's sweat and showing displeasure. He waved his hand toward Zhu Youde.

"Yes!" Zhu Youde quickly bowed and swayed his backside, leaving the hall. Lo Tian was left alone standing there.

Lo Tian looked at the dozen people; these were the power holders of the entire Tianlong Sect. He had only seen them once when he was recruited by the sect, and after that, except for Xue Changshan, he had never seen anyone else.

"Lo Tian? Tell us about your trial mission!" Li Changfeng smiled and spoke to Lo Tian, his eyes scanning over him. Others also looked at Lo Tian.

If it were anyone else, being stared at by a dozen strong people would definitely make them nervous. But for Lo Tian, it was nothing.

"Tell us, why did you return alone?" Li Changfeng smiled and spoke to Lo Tian. Although his tone seemed gentle, Lo Tian knew that if he made a mistake, it would be the end of him. Even Xue Changshan might not be able to save him.

"I followed Duan Changfeng and others into the Luantian Sect, and it was initially quite smooth. The Luantian Sect agreed to hand over the ascenders to us!"

"But who could have imagined that the Luantian Sect would use my conflict with their Grand Elder's grandson, Yao Qishui, as an excuse and negotiate with Duan Changfeng to exchange me for the ascenders!"

"Duan Changfeng is indeed a respected elder of our sect. He was willing to offend the Luantian Sect for his disciples, but they didn't reach an agreement and had a falling out. Who knew the Luantian Sect would attack us? Fortunately, Duan Changfeng and several other disciples fought together to let me escape!" Lo Tian's eyes were filled with excitement, his eyes slightly moist. In terms of acting skills, Lo Tian was definitely a top-tier talent.

Lo Tian kept speaking, praising Duan Changfeng, Zhu Fenghuo, and Ruan Xinghe to the skies, completely portraying a picture of protecting his disciples with bravery.

"Hmm..." After Lo Tian finished speaking, he wiped his eyes and looked at Li Changfeng with a determined gaze. "Sect Leader, Duan Changfeng, Zhu Senior Brother, and Ruan Senior Brother are still unknown whether they're alive or dead. Please go to the Luantian Sect and rescue them!" Lo Tian spoke loudly, his voice filled with excitement.

But Li Changfeng and the others only looked at Lo Tian without saying anything, which made Lo Tian feel a bad premonition.

"Did I make a mistake?" Lo Tian's heart skipped a beat, seeing the cold smile in one of the elders' eyes. It was as if they were looking at a clown.

"Did you finish?" Li Changfeng spoke softly, his voice devoid of any emotion; the entire hall was filled with an icy atmosphere.

"Shameless Lo Tian, betraying the sect and colluding with Luantian Sect, killing Duan Changfeng, Zhu Fenghuo, Ruan Xinghe, and eight outer gate disciples. You're still talking nonsense!" A voice of reprimand echoed as an old man stood up, glaring at Lo Tian with a cold expression. His aura of the initial stage of celestial immortal pressed down on Lo Tian.

Chapter 1864: Methods to Strengthen ()

"What's going on?" Lo Tian felt confused, unable to figure out where he had gone wrong. He had thought for an entire night about how to speak, and he was certain there were no flaws. The only possibility of a flaw was if Duan Changfeng had returned.

"No, they're deceiving me!" Lo Tian suddenly thought of a possibility. Although Duan Changfeng might have returned, Lo Tian was certain that the Luantian Sect would not easily let Duan Changfeng return. After all, he had caused a big commotion in the Luantian Sect.

After thinking through the night, Lo Tian was certain that Guan Hongsheng would not necessarily let Duan Changfeng return. After all, he was now under Guan Hongsheng's control. With Guan Hongsheng's cunning, he would definitely notice Duan Changfeng's hostility toward him.

Guan Hongsheng had previously told Lo Tian to stay put in the Tianlong Sect, which meant Guan Hongsheng had no intention of letting Duan Changfeng return to the Tianlong Sect. If he returned, Lo Tian would be in danger.

"Respectful Leader and Elders, I'm innocent!" Lo Tian realized everything and felt confident. He displayed a look of委屈 (sorrow) and shouted loudly.

"Every word I said is true; I would never lie. If the Leader doesn't believe me, you can go to Luantian Sect and ask; with your and the Elders' prestige, Luantian Sect would definitely not lie to you!" Lo Tian spoke loudly in defense, his eyes showing disappointment as if he had lost hope.

"Kid, although your words are beautiful, you still can't escape it. Betraying the sect is a serious crime!" One elder spoke, his voice cold.

"Then I know my mistake; it's worth dying to bring the news back to the sect. Zhu Senior Brother, Ruan Senior Brother, Duan Changfeng, if you're still around in the afterlife, wait for me!" Lo Tian said and sighed loudly, standing straight as if ready to be punished.

"Good, today I'll fulfill your wish and let you accompany them in death!" One elder stood up, looking at Lo Tian with a cold gaze. It was Zhang Jinghuan, the one who had tried to attack Lo Tian during the sect's recruitment.

"Buzz..." Zhang Jinghuan waved his hand, and a green hand appeared in the air, accompanied by a sound of wind. It rushed toward Lo Tian.

"Damn old man, one day I'll slap you to death!" Lo Tian cursed in his heart and looked at Xue Changshan, who had not moved.

"Father-in-law!" Zuo Qiuming looked anxious and sent a mental message to Xue Changshan. Only the few old men at the same level as Zhang Jinghuan could block his attack.

"Wait a little longer; let this kid experience the feeling of death before saving him, and it will be more effective!" Xue Changshan replied and slowly opened his eyes.

No one else in the hall moved; their expressions were thoughtful. Li Changfeng glanced at Xue Changshan and looked contemplative.

The green hand seemed slow but was almost within a zhang of Lo Tian in an instant, pushing him back with its pressure.

"Xue Changshan, are you really going to let him die?" Lo Tian thought and had prepared two plans. He was ready to activate the Book of Epochs at any moment.

Although Lo Tian wasn't sure if the Book of Epochs could defeat a celestial immortal, he knew it could definitely wound one.

"Zhang Jinghuan, you really have no memory!" As Lo Tian was about to activate the Book of Epochs for a desperate fight, Xue Changshan sneered.

"Boom..." The green hand exploded with a loud sound, and the invisible waves pushed Lo Tian back until he collided with the hall's wall.

"True celestial immortals are so strong!" Lo Tian looked at the seven celestial immortals and felt as if they were seven mountains, suffocating him.

"Xue Changshan, what's your intention?" Zhang Jinghuan looked angry; he had previously tried to kill Lo Tian and was almost killed by Xue Changshan. Now, he was stopped again, which made Zhang Jinghuan's face feel embarrassed.

"Because He Peak needs people; this kid has already agreed to join He Peak with Qiu Ming. He passed the test, so why did you try to kill him?" Xue Changshan spoke coldly but with strength.

"Haha, right! This kid is loyal and has no faults; he even has merits. He showed us the wolves' ambitions of Luantian Sect!" As Xue Changshan's words finished, another elder supported him with a smile, obviously standing on Xue Changshan's side. He had also stood on Xue Changshan's side during the sect recruitment vote.

"Enough, stop arguing; let's go to Luantian Sect and see what's really going on!" Just as the old men were about to argue, Li Changfeng coughed lightly and spoke.

"Ah, if Lo Tian's words are true, Luantian Sect is really going to stir up trouble!" Upon hearing Li Changfeng's words, the old men immediately turned their attention to Luantian Sect.

"Kid, you've once again saved your life!" Zhang Jinghuan smiled and spoke to Lo Tian.

"I don't know where I offended you, Senior!" Lo Tian looked puzzled; according to common sense, anyone could see that Zhang Jinghuan and Xue Changshan were not on good terms. And Xue Changshan had always helped him, but there was no need to target him so much. After all, he was just a celestial immortal in the middle stage and wasn't worth Zhang Jinghuan's attention.

"Leave! Let's talk about it when we return from Luantian Sect!" Li Changfeng spoke softly and ignored Lo Tian's question. If Zhang Jinghuan had spoken, Xue Lao Guai would definitely have argued back, and it might have led to another argument.

Lo Tian looked at the seven elders of the initial stage, memorizing their appearances thoroughly. He could feel that these seven people were also somewhat unfriendly; Xue Lao Guai was closer to the elder of Houfeng.

Zhang Jinghuan had a good relationship with a thin old man in black robes, while the other two elders clearly stood on Li Changfeng's side.

"Yes!" Lo Tian showed respect and left the hall, returning to the Tianlong Tomb.

"It's not possible to advance to celestial immortal in a short time; I need to master more methods!" Lo Tian sat cross-legged in the thatched hut and sighed deeply.

"I wonder if the beasts under the Tianlong Sect are strong!" Lo Tian muttered quietly, thinking about his methods. At this moment, he was only an outer gate disciple and could not obtain any effective means.

Lo Tian cultivated for a while, and at midnight, he changed into black combat gear and put on the Thousand Mirage Mask. Under the ghostly wails, he stepped out of the thatched hut and concealed his presence, wrapping his aura completely with his spiritual sense. Under the cover of night, he headed toward the Beast Garden where the Tianlong Sect kept its beasts.

The Beast Garden was also located in the outer gate, just like the Tianlong Tomb, and it was a nightmare for outer gate disciples. After all, the beasts had intelligence but were fierce; one could easily be injured by them.

The silent night, Lo Tian moved like a ghost and quickly found the place where the Tianlong Sect kept its beasts.

A black barrier rose, with two disciples of the initial stage of celestial immortal sitting at the entrance, their faces showing bitterness.

"Zhu Youde, you bastard! It's just because I knocked over your tea cup that I was sent here! This is trying to take our lives!" One disciple muttered lowly, even though they were behind the barrier, they could still feel the fierce energy from behind. The thought of having to feed these beasts in the day made him feel a bit fearful.

"Ah... it's only one month, and if I'm careful, there shouldn't be any problems. The beasts inside are masters; they have intelligence. I heard that being assigned to the Tianlong Tomb is even worse, spending days with ghosts and spirits. You never know when you might lose your life," the other guard disciple comforted him, but they were more like serving these beasts than guarding them. After all, both of them were only at the initial stage of celestial immortal.

Lo Tian silently passed by the two and entered the barrier without making a sound; he had already scouted earlier, and this barrier was only for preventing the beasts from escaping and harming people.

After all, the beasts kept in the Tianlong Sect must not be easy to deal with; unless one was at the initial stage of celestial immortal, no one dared to enter here.

"Roar..." As Lo Tian stepped into the Beast Garden, his face slightly changed.

The Beast Garden was naturally vast and boundless; as soon as he entered, he saw a group of beasts lying there. Upon entering, the beasts were cautious but, after opening their eyes and not finding anyone, they closed their eyes again lazily.

"Compared to the beast prison of Luantian Sect, this is twice as big!" Lo Tian's eyes shone with excitement and a smile. He could feel that the beasts here were of a higher level than those in Luantian Sect, and he could even sense powerful energies deep within the garden.

"Haha, this is also one of my secrets!" Lo Tian made a hand sign and the green Beast Control Seal flew out from his body.

"Roar..." As Lo Tian performed the Beast Control Seal, a group of fierce beasts noticed his presence and immediately stood up.

"Buzz..." However, just as the beasts were about to attack Lo Tian, the Beast Control Seal emitted a tremendous aura. Green energy surged from it and instantly enveloped the entire Beast Garden.

"Roar..." Upon seeing this green energy, all the beasts roared and began to greedily devour it.

"It worked!" Lo Tian muttered in his heart, retrieving the Beast Control Seal and quickly leaving the Beast Garden.

"What's going on? Why are these beasts so crazy at this time of night?" As Lo Tian left, he faintly heard the two guards discussing.

"Buzz..." Just as they started to discuss, a massive spiritual energy vortex rose up, and strong suction force came from the Beast Garden.

"Ah?" At the same time, all the elders of various peaks in the Tianlong Sect opened their eyes and looked toward the direction of the Beast Garden with surprise.

"What's going on? A large number of beasts have advanced!" They all spoke at the same time in their quarters, their voices filled with shock.

Chapter 1865: Cen Hongwei ()

The collective advancement of the beasts spread quickly throughout the Tianlong Sect, and everyone was discussing it.

"Several elders have gone there but couldn't find anything!"

"Heaven blesses the Tianlong Sect; the battle for supremacy is approaching, and our beasts have improved one level. This will definitely strengthen the strength of the Tianlong Sect!" Although they couldn't find out why, people were excited.

"The two guards of the Beast Garden also received heavy rewards; they were promoted to the inner gate. This will make Zhu Youde suffer, since everyone knows that guarding the Beast Garden is not a good job!" Lo Tian walked on the road, listening to people's discussions and smiling as he headed toward the Beast Garden. He found a corner unnoticed by anyone and practiced his Beast Control Seal under the midday sun.

Two days had passed since Lo Tian secretly entered the Beast Garden. In these two days, every noon he came here to practice his Beast Control Seal secretly. In two days, Lo Tian's strength had improved rapidly and he had completely controlled the beasts of the initial stage of celestial immortal in the Beast Garden. As for those at the later and peak stages, he still had no confidence.

However, Lo Tian also had his own resources: Long Jie, the pure dragon emperor bloodline. This was a suppression for the beasts; if there were an emergency, he could bring out Long Jie to force those beasts into submission.

One hour passed quietly; Lo Tian felt that his golden-black immortal pill in the dantian was almost complete.

"Terrifying Beast Control Seal and Ghost Control Seal!" Lo Tian slowly stood up, his face showing admiration. In two days, he felt that his strength had increased at an extremely terrifying speed, enough to be twice or three times faster than other disciples of the initial stage of celestial immortal.

This was all because of the Beast Control Seal and Ghost Control Seal; when he cultivated these two techniques, he also received counterattacks from beasts and ghosts.

"If I had a hundred spiritual beings or beasts at the initial stage of celestial immortal to counterattack me, I could enter the later stage in just a few days!" Lo Tian calculated in his mind but shook his head. Where would he find so many beasts and ghosts?

"Boom..." The bell rang, a deep and profound sound echoing through the Tianlong Mountain. Lo Tian's face showed a slight smile, his gaze toward Dan Peak.

"The Dan Competition at Dan Peak has started!" The entire Tianlong Sect became excited, and all the alchemists showed a passionate look. They got up and flew toward Dan Peak.

"Let's go; today my patron has another one, also a means of counterbalancing Xue Changshan!" Lo Tian muttered quietly and then walked toward Dan Peak.

The Dan Competition at Dan Peak was a major event for the Tianlong Sect, especially since Xuan Dan would select his disciple from among those participating.

At this moment, the peak was crowded with people; a high platform could accommodate nearly a thousand people. People kept jumping onto the platform, their faces determined.

Below the platform, people constantly discussed and looked at those on the platform, recognizing them one by one and causing a stir.

"I think this time, Senior Brother Zhao Ritian will definitely be the best and become Master Xuan Dan's disciple!"

"Haha, I think so too. Senior Brother Zhao Ritian has always been a registered disciple; his strength is the fourth in the Tianlong Ranking. His alchemy skills are also a three-star immortal disciple, so it shouldn't be a problem!"

"It's not necessarily the case. Master Xuan Dan has six registered disciples; none of them are easy to deal with. They all want to become Master Xuan Dan's disciple! For example, Tian Xiong Senior Brother; even the top-ranked Cen Hongwei is a registered disciple of Master Xuan Dan. I wonder how good his alchemy skills are!" People whispered among themselves.

When people heard the name Cen Hongwei, their faces changed immediately. Cen Hongwei was the top-ranked in the Tianlong Ranking and an extreme-level immortal. He had not changed for many years, and he was low-key; people hadn't seen him much. However, those who had met Cen Hongwei would feel fear upon mentioning his name.

"Will I be able to see Senior Brother Cen? Recently, that mysterious Dan Luo hasn't appeared. It's been a long time since I heard about Dan Luo!"

"Although Dan Luo was famous for a while, it's just some fame. This time, the competition is fierce with Zhao Ritian and Tian Xiong; Dan Luo really isn't anything!" Lo Tian stood among the crowd, smiling. He hadn't expected anyone to remember the name Dan Luo.

"All disciples participating in the Dan Competition should come up!" As people were discussing, Xuan Dan's aged voice echoed from the sky with a smile.

"Respect to Master Xuan Dan!" A sea of voices echoed, and each disciple of the Tianlong Sect showed respect as they bowed to Xuan Dan.

"Buzz..." A group of figures flew into the air toward the high platform, and Lo Tian stood among the crowd without making a sound, appearing rather unremarkable.

"Lo Tian!" Although he was not the most noticeable, Lo Tian was still recognized by people. After all, most of those participating in the Dan Competition were disciples from Dan Peak, and they naturally knew about Lo Tian's previous incident of causing trouble at Dan Peak.

"Brave enough to come, huh? Come to suffer!" Several disciples from Dan Peak whispered among themselves, looking at Lo Tian with ill intentions.

Lo Tian simply stood there calmly, his gaze toward Xuan Dan sitting high up; beside him were several elders of Dan Peak.

"The Dan Competition is naturally about alchemy. I will give you some kinds of spiritual herbs; you can make them as you wish. The one who makes the best medicine will be first!" Xuan Dan spoke softly.

"Hmm?" Lo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, sensing something was wrong with Xuan Dan's words. He hadn't mentioned how many rounds the competition would have; he had immediately let everyone make alchemy, which clearly indicated that this Dan Competition was not simple.

"Buzz..." After Xuan Dan finished speaking, he waved his hand, and a golden dragon soared into the sky before forming into a string of characters floating above everyone's heads.

"Shaped Grass, Explosive Star Flower..." Names of spiritual herbs appeared in everyone's view. There were thousands of kinds, but no indication of what kind of medicine they were.

"These herbs can be freely combined; you decide what kind of medicine to make!" Xuan Dan spoke softly.

"Ah, I see now!" Lo Tian immediately understood in his mind. There were over a thousand people on the platform, and providing them with herbs for making the same kind of medicine was impossible. Even Dan Peak couldn't afford it.

Xuan Dan had listed so many herbs, clearly intending for people to bring their own herbs. This would involve luck.

"This is indeed a different kind of assessment!" Lo Tian, who had participated in several Dan Competitions before, had never encountered such a competition.

However, he could understand it; after all, the participants were confident. But there would still be high and low levels. The best way to determine their level was by how many herbs they had.

The fame of an alchemist was very important; the better their alchemy skills, the more people would seek them out to make medicine, and thus they would have more herbs.

Therefore, without enough herbs, this round could make many people give up; with no herbs, Zhao Ritian and Tian Xiong wouldn't be able to make a three-star medicine and would have no hope.

"Wow..." Indeed, soon after the platform was filled with people's sighs and expressions of regret, some people jumped down from the platform.
