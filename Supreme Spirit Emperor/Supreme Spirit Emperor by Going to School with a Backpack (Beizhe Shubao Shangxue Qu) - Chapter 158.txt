“Alas…” Luo Tian let out a soft sigh, leading over a hundred attendants onto an uninhabited continent. He ordered them to rest, for even Realm-Transcending Immortals found prolonged flight through the void exhausting.

After issuing his commands, Luo Tian sat upon the continent, instinctively expanding his spiritual awareness.

“Hmph?” His brows furrowed instantly as his spiritual senses detected a faint disturbance, his gaze sharpening.

Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness now rivaled that of a Heaven-Transcending Immortal. Had he not merged five elements into one, he would have already been a Six-Origin Heaven-Transcending Immortal. Though reduced to Three-Origin, his vast spiritual awareness remained intact.

Within his senses, a subtle fluctuation approached them. Though the energy was weak, it escaped no notice from Luo Tian.

“In this Four Sacred Star Domain, I’ve never offended anyone—save for the White Tiger Sect!” Luo Tian mused aloud, his expression contemplative.

“Murderous intent… it truly targets me!” His eyes turned icy, and with a single step, he surged forward like a meteor toward the disturbance.

Chapter 760: Tiger Prison Star

Chapter 760: Tiger Prison Star

In the Four Sacred Star Domain, Luo Tian’s attendants sat upon an uninhabited continent, their faces etched with confusion as they watched Luo Tian vanish into the distance. They rose swiftly to follow, but it was too late—Realm-Transcending Immortals moved with terrifying speed.

At the moment Luo Tian’s voice rang out, three of his attendants already stood a thousand miles away.

“Too late!” A cold voice echoed, and the three stunned attendants halted mid-step.

In an instant, a crushing pressure enveloped them, shaking their minds.

“Boom!” A colossal black spiritual energy hand materialized before the three Realm-Transcending Immortals, seizing them. Under immense pressure, they were reduced to blood mist, their souls unable to escape.

“Damn it! It’s not just one person!” Luo Tian halted mid-flight, his face contorted with fury. To have his attendants slain before him was an unforgivable insult. Though they were lowly pawns in the Blue Dragon Sect, to Luo Tian, they were living beings with the right to exist.

“Show yourself!” Luo Tian roared, his fist striking the void with a thunderous aura.

“Crack!” A sharp sound echoed, as if lightning had split the sky. A battered middle-aged man emerged from the void, his pale face streaked with blood, his eyes wide with disbelief. A prison character “囚” (prison) marked his face.

“Another one—do you intend to drag me out?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold, his spiritual senses probing for the second assailant.

“Indeed, your talent is remarkable,” a chilling voice echoed. From the void, another middle-aged man in black robes appeared, his face also marked with a prison character.

“Tiger Prison Star? Are they escapees from Tiger Prison Star?” The attendants, who had held back, murmured in alarm.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed as he observed the two men. Tiger Prison Star was a domain within the Four Sacred Star Domain, guarded by one Seven-Origin Immortal and two Six-Origin Immortals from each of the four sects.

“A Three-Origin, a Four-Origin?” Luo Tian’s expression darkened upon sensing their cultivation levels.

“Who released you? You two were under heavy guard—how could you escape so easily?” Luo Tian’s voice was steady, devoid of fear.

“Boy, you’re not dumb. Someone released us to take your life. As for who… we won’t say. When you die, ask your attendants in the afterlife,” the Four-Origin Immortal smirked.

“Do you think two of you can take me down?” Luo Tian sneered, charging forward like a golden lightning bolt toward the Three-Origin Immortal.

“Fool!” The Three-Origin Immortal, wounded by Luo Tian’s earlier punch, felt his pride wounded. His body radiated three origins of power, and he struck back with a fist.

“Three simple origins? You dare challenge me?” Luo Tian snorted, watching the Three-Origin Immortal’s golden, red, and brown spiritual energy.

“Crack!” Their fists collided, lightning surging. Luo Tian’s newly mastered lightning origin overwhelmed the Three-Origin Immortal, who felt as if struck by thunder. The Three-Origin’s energy was absorbed into Luo Tian’s Primordial Chaos Origin, leaving no harm.

The Three-Origin Immortal was hurled back, crashing into a thousand-mile-diameter star that shattered upon impact.

Meanwhile, the Four-Origin Immortal’s blade cleaved through space, slicing toward Luo Tian.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian’s feet glowed with infinite light as he stepped into the Heaven-Blocking Step. His spatial origin infused his movements, matching even a Six-Origin Immortal’s speed.

The blade sliced through space but only met Luo Tian’s shadow, its four-color slash shattering countless stars before vanishing.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with cold fire as his Splitting Heaven Spear hummed to life. Four sword techniques, imbued with overwhelming power, rained down on the Four-Origin Immortal, leaving bloodstains across his body.

“Siyuan Immortal! He’s no match for the master!” The attendants marveled, their faces alight with exhilaration.

“Kill! You must die today!” The two men snarled, their eyes wild. They were prisoners of Tiger Prison Star, lured by a promise: kill a genius and they’d be freed.

Though strong, Tiger Prison Star’s conditions were brutal. Even with Three and Four-Origin levels, they faced death daily. When offered such a chance, they accepted without hesitation—no one could resist.

Seeing them converge on him, Luo Tian’s battle spirit flared. His Splitting Heaven Spear gleamed as he fought like a war god, his golden headband fluttering in the wind.

“Two against me? What can you do?” Luo Tian thrust his spear and punched, unafraid of their combined attack.

The clash echoed through the void as Luo Tian dueled with the two Immortals, their blows clashing hundreds of times in moments.

Though formidable, the Tiger Prison Star prisoners grew increasingly fearful. Their combined strength was no match for Luo Tian’s overwhelming power.

“You’re truly a prodigy, the strongest I’ve seen in centuries,” one admitted. “But today, you must die. Only then can we be free.”

“Don’t worry—dying under our strongest technique will let you rest in peace!” The Four-Origin Immortal coldly declared, exchanging a glance with his partner.

“Bai Tian Lang Die!” They roared in unison, their bodies radiating power. Seven origins flared from their cores, forming a wave of energy that seemed to tear through the void.

Luo Tian felt an immediate threat. Though he could dodge, his back held over a hundred attendants—he couldn’t let them die.

With a flick of his hands, he unleashed the Primordial Chaos Origin. A gray mountain erupted from the void, colliding with the seven-color wave.

“Burst Mountain!” Luo Tian barked, detonating the mountain. The explosion clashed with the wave, creating a mushroom cloud that spread into a cataclysmic storm.

“Primordial Chaos Domain!” Luo Tian leapt to the continent where his attendants waited, expanding the domain to shield them.

“Boom!” The thunderous sound shook the attendants, who trembled in fear.

I’ll write more if I can—perhaps four thousand or six thousand words tonight.

Chapter 761: Xuanwu Old Tortoise

The attendants trembled as the storm raged. Even Realm-Transcending Immortals looked terrified.

The storm pierced the void, drawing in countless stars that shattered into fragments.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The fragments struck Luo Tian’s gray domain, echoing like thunder.

The storm raged for a moment before calming. Luo Tian’s face was pale—his domain had relied on the Primordial Chaos Origin. A regular spiritual energy domain would have shattered instantly, endangering his attendants.

But the Primordial Chaos Origin had been greatly drained.

After sensing the calm, Luo Tian retracted his domain, exhaling heavily. His spiritual senses scanned a hundred miles around, finding no stone intact—everything had been shattered.

Yet he didn’t dwell on it. His senses extended further, eventually spotting two bloodied figures in a remote star.

The Two Tiger Prison Star Immortals had used their origin-burning technique to counter Luo Tian. Now, with no origins left, they relied on their bodies to withstand the storm’s force—predictably, they were crushed.

Luo Tian kicked off the ground, seven steps later appearing before the weakened men.

“Send you to your death!” His spear pierced the Three-Origin Immortal, its soul shredded instantly.

“Don’t kill me! I was forced! I can pledge allegiance to you—tell me who sent us!” The Four-Origin Immortal pleaded, fear in his eyes.

Luo Tian’s hands flashed with seals, unleashing a powerful binding force toward the man.

Realizing Luo Tian meant to imprison him rather than kill, the man sighed in relief—survival was still possible.

But as Luo Tian’s seals neared the man, a cold, authoritative voice echoed:

“Daring Tiger Prison Star prisoner! You were to be spared if you stayed, but escaping is a death sentence!”

A golden hand shot from the void, its power overwhelming even Luo Tian. It struck the Four-Origin Immortal without hesitation.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with anger but he dodged, using the Heaven-Blocking Step and his lightning and spatial origins to vanish.

“Boom!” The star shattered, and the Four-Origin Immortal died under the golden hand’s wrath.

“Eliminate witnesses?” Luo Tian mused, understanding why the man was killed.

A figure materialized—a senior with a smile. “Young master, don’t panic. I am the Tiger Prison Star’s Jail-Subduing Immortal, Hu Tianyun.”

“White Tiger Sect?” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He sensed the man’s cultivation: Seven-Origin Immortal.

“Seven-Origin!” Luo Tian’s heart pounded, but he masked his fear.

“You’ve guessed my identity. I am one of the Four Sacred Star Domain’s Heaven-Transcending Immortals. Our sect leader offered you a deal—your talent is unmatched. The White Tiger Sect can match the Blue Dragon Sect in resources, even surpassing them!” Hu Tianyun smiled but took a step forward.

That single step caused the surrounding space to tremble, sealing all energy within a thousand miles.

Luo Tian’s face darkened. Facing a Seven-Origin Immortal, he had no chance to resist. Yet the White Tiger Sect’s invitation was clearly not about his talent alone. The Blue Dragon Sect had been more discreet, but this one was ruthless.

Despite Hu Tianyun’s calm demeanor, Luo Tian knew refusal would mean death.

“Apologies, I am a Blue Dragon Sect disciple. I cannot betray my sect,” Luo Tian said respectfully.

“Temporarily?” Hu Tianyun’s smile deepened, but his gaze turned icy.

“The Blue Dragon Sect disciple Luo Tian conspired with Tiger Prison Star escapees. I’ve caught him—execute him immediately!” Hu Tianyun’s voice rang out, each word like a divine decree.

“Old dog!” Luo Tian spat blood, his eyes wild. He knew Hu Tianyun had killed intent. To die without fighting was not his way—no matter the odds, he would fight.

Luo Tian’s three origins surged into his feet, activating the Heaven-Blocking Step. He became a gray streak, slicing through the void.

“Fast—even a Six-Origin Immortal couldn’t match your speed!” Hu Tianyun marveled but smiled.

Hu Tianyun took a step, crossing time itself to appear behind Luo Tian. He struck with a palm, its power immense.

“Damn! Too strong!” Luo Tian’s eyes bled as he felt the palm’s might. He couldn’t block it, but his speed was already maxed.

The spiritual energy palm roared, crushing stars as it reached Luo Tian’s back. The pressure slowed his speed.

“Done!” Luo Tian’s eyes filled with despair—how could he die like this?

“Shatter…” A deep voice echoed, and Hu Tianyun’s palm shattered into wind. Luo Tian’s escape speed doubled.

Spitting blood, he crashed through three stars before stopping. He gazed at the void.

“Hu Tianyun, you killed my disciple—what gives you the right?” Sha Cangmang’s voice echoed.

“Master!” The attendants’ faces lit up with relief.

A Seven-Origin Immortal was beyond their reach—no matter their self-destruction, they couldn’t harm Hu Tianyun. But now, Sha Cangmang had arrived.

“Sha Cangmang!” Hu Tianyun’s face paled. Though their origins differed by one, that gap was insurmountable.

Sha Cangmang’s presence offered him a chance to flee, but it was slim. Now Hu Tianyun felt the same desperation as Luo Tian had earlier.

“Seems the White Tiger Sect has grown bold—daring to attack my disciple!” Sha Cangmang’s calm face finally showed anger.

Luo Tian was vital to the Blue Dragon Sect—without him, they wouldn’t have invested so much. Sha Cangmang had secretly protected Luo Tian since he’d struggled, now revealing himself.

“Master!” Hu Tianyun’s voice was fierce. “Luo Tian conspired with Tiger Prison Star escapees—this crime deserves death!”

“Give him a dignified end. If I capture him, you know my methods,” Sha Cangmang said coldly.

“Sha Cangmang, I am a Seven-Origin Immortal. If I fight to the end, you’ll suffer too. Today’s mistake is mine—I’ll make amends,” Hu Tianyun said, still defiant.

“Harm me? You’re beneath my contempt!” Sha Cangmang didn’t argue further. He extended his hand, binding the void with eight origins—eight dragons coiled around Hu Tianyun.

“Roar!” A scream echoed, shaking Luo Tian.

“Powerful—too powerful!” Luo Tian marveled at Sha Cangmang’s eight origins. An Eight-Origin Immortal could annihilate stars, and Hu Tianyun, a Seven-Origin, couldn’t resist.

“Roar…”

“Sha elder, let him live—cultivation is hard. Though Hu Tianyun erred, it’s not worth killing!” A roar echoed, making Sha Cangmang frown.

Chapter 762: The Benevolent Elder

In the endless void, thunder echoed as eight origins moved toward Sha Cangmang. Hu Tianyun’s face was terrified, his body trembling under the pressure.

He’d thought he could escape but underestimated Sha Cangmang’s power. Against eight origins, he could only defend passively—no matter his effort, escape was impossible.

Seeing Hu Tianyun bound, Luo Tian and his attendants were stunned. The man who’d nearly killed him now was a prisoner.

“Space, Time, Light…” Luo Tian marveled at Sha Cangmang’s eight origins. Five were great paths, the others strong enough to rival five-element paths.

“The Blue Dragon Sect’s Master is terrifying!” Luo Tian marveled, grateful he’d merged five elements into the Primordial Chaos Path. Otherwise, even as an Eight-Origin Immortal, he’d be no match for a great path master.

Sha Cangmang brought Hu Tianyun before him, his gaze deep as a roar echoed.

Hearing the roar, Luo Tian followed Sha Cangmang’s gaze. Though the sound was deafening, he detected a lazy undertone.

As Luo Tian expected, a jade-colored giant tortoise approached, its body like a star. The attendants gasped in awe.

“Chen Xuanning, you’re playing the benevolent again,” Sha Cangmang smiled at the tortoise.

“Chen Xuanning, Master of the Xuanwu Sect!” Luo Tian’s face was stunned. But upon sensing Chen Xuanning’s power, his brows furrowed.

“Seven-Origin!” Luo Tian sensed the man’s strength—though stronger than Hu Tianyun, it was still one level below Sha Cangmang.

“Master Chen Xuanning, all is well?” Sha Cangmang greeted respectfully.

Seeing Sha Cangmang’s respect, Luo Tian was stunned. The tortoise seemed ordinary but earned such reverence—his jaw dropped.

The tortoise opened its eyes, lifeless and uninterested in Sha Cangmang. It nodded slightly before closing its eyes again.

“This is Xuanwu, the sect’s guardian beast! We’ve seen it!” The attendants murmured in excitement.

“Xuanwu!” Luo Tian marveled, recalling ancient Blue Dragon Sect records.

Long ago, the four sects had four guardian beasts—each a Nine-Origin Immortal. Over time, they’d passed away.

Xuanwu was the last remaining beast, its power unmatched.

“Hence why Sha Cangmang respects it!” Luo Tian realized, gazing at the jade tortoise with reverence.

The tortoise opened its eyes again, glancing at Luo Tian. Its ancient gaze held surprise before it nodded slightly, a deep voice echoing in their minds.

Seeing Xuanwu’s gaze, Sha Cangmang subtly positioned himself before Luo Tian.

Though powerful, Xuanwu’s time was nearing its end. If he attacked now, it would hasten its death.

“Sha Cangmang! Don’t act on your thoughts—this boy is no ordinary talent. I warn you, don’t proceed or you’ll regret it!” Xuanwu’s voice echoed like thunder.

“Sha Cangmang indeed has designs on me!” Luo Tian’s mind raced, his expression conflicted.

Chen Xuanning, standing in the void, was stunned by Xuanwu’s mental transmission: “This youth must be treated kindly—don’t neglect him.”

Xuanwu’s status was unparalleled. His words left Chen Xuanning shaken.

Sha Cangmang’s face darkened—Xuanwu’s words were clearly deliberate, but what they meant was unclear.

Sha Cangmang knew Xuanwu had lived longer than him, seeing more and understanding more. His words carried weight.

Sha Cangmang turned to Luo Tian, his gaze contemplative. He saw no grandeur in the boy—only talent.

“Let it be for now. When he reaches Heaven-Transcending, we’ll decide,” Sha Cangmang sighed inwardly. If not for the plan, he’d have cherished this genius.

“Fate is cruel,” Sha Cangmang sighed, nodding to Xuanwu.

“Sha elder, show mercy—this man has lost two souls and is severely wounded. His cultivation will take time to recover. Let him go—his service to Tiger Prison Star was commendable!” Chen Xuanning pleaded.

Sha Cangmang’s lips curled—Chen Xuanning was kind to a fault. Whenever he saw someone about to kill, he’d intervene, sparing enemies out of compassion.

But Sha Cangmang was no one to fear. He clenched his hands, and the Seven-Origin Hu Tianyun was instantly reduced to a pile of flesh.

“Alas… Sha elder, your violence is excessive,” Chen Xuanning sighed, pitying the bloodied Hu Tianyun.

If he could fight Sha Cangmang, he’d stop him. But now, he sighed and smiled at Luo Tian: “Young master, visit my White Tiger Sect when you have time. I’ll introduce my granddaughter to you.”

“Huh?” Luo Tian was surprised—this was the third sect master to show him favor. Compared to Sha Cangmang and Jin Yongsi, he felt Chen Xuanning was more sincere.

But with Sha Cangmang nearby, Luo Tian knew he couldn’t openly betray him. After all, he was still Sha Cangmang’s disciple.

“Thank you, elder. I’ll visit Xuanwu Sect when time permits,” Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

The attendants looked at Luo Tian with reverence. Seeing Sha Cangmang’s power and Xuanwu Sect’s guardian beast, they felt their pilgrimage was worth it.

“Enough dawdling—let’s hurry to the Divine Realm,” Chen Xuanning said, flying toward the Divine Realm atop Xuanwu.

“Don’t worry—I won’t harm you,” Sha Cangmang smiled, his voice gentle.

“Liar!” Luo Tian thought, but he bowed respectfully behind Sha Cangmang.

The two exchanged smiles, a strange emotion stirring in the attendants’ hearts. They felt something odd about their master and disciple but didn’t dwell on it—after all, they were just attendants. Sha Cangmang’s status was unparalleled; meeting him was rare.

“Let’s go—this ranking battle relies on you,” Sha Cangmang waved his sleeve, vanishing with Luo Tian and the continent into the void.

“Luo Tian—Nine-Origin Body, impressive!” Sha Cangmang’s group vanished, and the void split open. Two red lights emerged—two red eyes appeared in the star domain before vanishing.

Another two chapters of six thousand words—any surprises?

Chapter 763: The Sacred Realm Ranking Battle Begins

The Four Sacred Star Domain, the Divine Realm.

At this moment, the Divine Realm was bustling with people discussing the Sacred Realm Ranking Battle—its outcome determined resource allocation for the next century.

On the domain’s exclusive platform, four thrones carved with the Four Sacred Beasts stood. The people of the Divine Realm bowed respectfully.

Only the four sect masters could sit on these thrones.

Two elders smiled, sitting on the thrones representing Zhuque and Baihu. Their eyes met with a hidden meaning.

“Where are those two?” Zhuque Sect’s Master Ke Zhentian asked, eyeing Jin Yongsi.

“Ah… perhaps something delayed them,” Jin Yongsi smiled, stroking a tiger head carving on his hand.

“Hmph… Jin Yongsi’s plans are well-laid,” the void split, and Sha Cangmang appeared. He moved swiftly to sit on the Blue Dragon throne.

“Alas… Sha elder, your speed is too fast—I left first but you arrived before me,” a gentle voice echoed. The benevolent elder Chen Xuanning smiled, appearing on the Xuanwu throne. Meanwhile, Xuanwu Tortoise floated in the void, eyes closed.

“Four masters are gathered!” The Divine Realm erupted with excitement.

The four were revered as gods, their voices unified. All people bowed and cried: “Respect the Four Masters!”

The cry echoed like thunder, piercing beyond the domain. Sha Cangmang’s group smiled slightly.

“Enough—soon, four sect members will organize the battle. Let us catch up!” Ke Zhentian smiled, his voice echoing in everyone’s ears, calming the crowd.
