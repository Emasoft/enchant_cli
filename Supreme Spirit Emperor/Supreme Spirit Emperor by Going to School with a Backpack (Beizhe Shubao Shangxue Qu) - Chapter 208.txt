“Luo Tian?” Before Sun Hewei could speak, Sun Ruming furrowed her brows, her silver moon-like eyes filled with contemplation. Her vermilion lips parted as if to speak but ultimately closed, standing silently.

Yet within Sun Mengru’s mind, a vague figure repeatedly surfaced, causing her to grow restless.

“Provoking my divine clan so many times—this is indeed deserving of death. However, our objective lies in the Ancient Heaven Palace. If we can kill him, do not let him live. In this demon domain, it is difficult to move against him!” Sun Hewei’s voice was as cold as a thousand years of ice, leading Sun Ruming away from Sun Feiwen and the others. After all, Sun Feiwen’s group was currently struggling to move within the Holy City; it was impossible for the Holy Maiden to sleep on the streets.

“Then he’s leaving…” People stared in astonishment as Sun Hewei and Sun Ruming departed, exclaiming softly.

Sun Feiwen’s group knew their great elder appeared as a kind old man, but once he lost his temper, even the clan leader would fear him.

“The demon domain is so powerful that even our irritable elder dares not act recklessly!” The divine clan’s people wore expressions of admiration, gazing at the eight jade-like beasts standing like mountains in the heart of the Holy City.

...

Time flowed slowly. Before they knew it, three days had passed, and only two remained until the auction.

That day, all members of the Rhino Clan in the Holy City were stirred into upheaval. They stood respectfully at the entrance of their clan’s territory, faces filled with reverence as they welcomed two guests clad in purple robes—a senior and a youth.

Luo Tian and his companions felt the abnormality early that morning. Their faces bore curiosity as they followed the Rhino Clan’s people, observing the two at the entrance.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. A strange familiarity tugged at him, as if he had seen this purple-robed youth before.

“Respect for Lord Diao!” Sun Hongda and the Rhino Clan’s people bowed deeply, their faces filled with reverence.

“Are these two from the Eight Holy Clans?” Luo Tian’s face bore confusion as he sensed their cultivation levels, his expression suddenly shifting.

“Terrifying!” The elder gave the impression of calmness, but as Luo Tian probed, he found himself unable to discern the elder’s cultivation level. It was as if his spiritual sense had been devoured by a black hole, leaving Luo Tian deeply wary. Since entering the Saint realm, the only person whose cultivation he could not perceive was Gu Tianyu. Even the old ninth of the Demon Domain who had wounded him before, Luo Tian could sense their Saint peak cultivation.

Compared to the elder, the youth’s cultivation was clear—half-step Saint. However, the youth exuded a carefree aura.

“Enough. There’s nothing for you to do today!” The elder smiled slightly, raising his hand. Sun Hongda and the others immediately stood upright.

“Luo Tian! Come out, you bastard! I’m not running today. Come on, stand here and catch me! If I run again, I won’t be Diao Dezhù!” The youth shouted loudly, his gaze sweeping over the crowd and landing on Luo Tian at the back. He waved a finger at Luo Tian.

“Do we know each other?” Luo Tian’s face bore confusion. He could not fathom when he had offended the youth, nor did he understand why the youth seemed to hold a deep grudge against him. The name Diao Dezhù meant nothing to him.

“Luo Tian, you son of a bitch! I’m coming for you!” The youth jumped up, pointing his finger at Luo Tian and cursing loudly.

The entire Rhino Clan was stunned. They did not know when Luo Tian had offended this young master, who had returned to the Holy City years ago.

Not only was the Rhino Clan stunned, but Luo Tian himself was equally bewildered. He could not fathom when he had offended this Diao Dezhù.

Though Luo Tian was bewildered, the youth’s direct insult ignited his anger. However, he remained rooted to the spot due to the elder’s formidable presence.

“Who do you think you are? Who forgot to fasten their pants and let you out? Come here to curse people… Don’t say that, go back and grow up before coming out again!” Before Luo Tian could speak, Xu Liyi, the curse-monger himself, spoke first. He stepped in front of Luo Tian, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

“Exactly! You don’t know shame. You look like you haven’t even grown hair yet…” Xu Liyi’s words ignited a firecracker-like explosion. Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, Tian Luo, and other chatterboxes also launched into curses, each like a firecracker, bombarding the youth named Diao Dezhù.

Luo Tian wanted to stop them but could not. It seemed the past days’ busyness had left them all pent up.

Diao Dezhù was no pushover either. Seeing someone dare to curse him, his voice grew even louder, retaliating with curses of his own. The insults were unbearable.

Luo Tian’s cold sweat poured down as he glanced at Diao Dezhù’s elder, sensing the elder’s face gradually darkening. His heart drummed nervously.

Luo Tian had clearly heard Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi’s curses just now, which had even insulted the youth’s ancestors.

“Stop it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened as he scolded Xu Liyi and the others. He knew they were perhaps emboldened by the elder’s lack of cultivation.

“Uh…” After Luo Tian spoke, Xu Liyi and the others hesitated. Then they suddenly realized that the Rhino Clan treated these two with such reverence, understanding they were not to be trifled with. Their faces turned awkward as they retreated behind Luo Tian.

The Rhino Clan people were utterly stunned, their expressions filled with disbelief as they gazed at Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin behind Luo Tian.

“Throughout these years, this is the first time someone has cursed the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan. Even the Phoenix and Dragon Clans have never done so!” The Rhino Clan people were still in shock.

“Let your friend apologize to Lord Diao!” Sun Hongda quickly spoke, his gaze turning toward Luo Tian with a subtle shift.

The Eight Holy Clans—Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan—was a unique presence among the Eight Holy Clans. Its numbers were sparse, even fewer than the Dragon Clan. Previously, only Lord Diao existed. Recently, Diao Dezhù’s return had made Lord Diao immensely pleased.

This was Luo Tian and his group. If it were anyone else, the Rhino Clan would have rushed to fight them. A common beast insulted by humans would fight back, let alone the revered Eight Holy Clans.

“Respectful elder, I apologize. My friends… uh… have bad habits and are quite crude. Please don’t take it personally!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, mustering his courage to step forward and bow.

At that moment, Luo Tian recalled the elder who had appeared among the Eight Holy Clans outside the Holy City. The elder had been quite low-key then, so Luo Tian hadn’t paid much attention.

The elder known as Lord Diao had no emotion on his face, but his expression was unpleased. He scanned Luo Tian and Gu Lei, Xu Liyi, and others before falling silent.

However, when the elder’s gaze fell on Long Jie, his brows furrowed. His eyes held contemplation but he said nothing.

Being scanned by the elder, Gu Lei and others felt their minds tremble. They had previously thought him merely an old fool but now realized the magnitude of the trouble they had caused.

Gu Lei and others longed to beat themselves, their faces filled with endless embarrassment as they watched Luo Tian bow before the elder.

“Hmph. Apologies won’t help. Come on, see if you recognize me. Today I’m here to discipline you. Be my steed, and this will be settled!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore arrogance as he panted, having been exhausted from cursing Xu Liyi and others.

Hearing Diao Dezhù’s words, Gu Lei and others grimaced. If this fellow weren’t an enemy, they might have had common ground. The idea of taking humans as steeds was absurd.

“Sorry, I truly don’t know when I offended you!” Seeing the elder didn’t respond, Luo Tian’s heart finally relaxed. He turned to Diao Dezhù with a smile.

“What? You don’t recognize me? You’ve forgotten this noble being! You’re killing me, you’re killing me! I’ll kill you!” Diao Dezhù seemed insulted beyond measure, feeling utterly humiliated.

“I truly don’t recognize you…” Luo Tian’s face bore awkwardness. Though the youth gave him a familiar feeling, he could not recall where they had met.

“Good, good, good!” Diao Dezhù’s face turned red, his hands trembling with anger. His eyes burned with endless fury: “You bastard, show me the purple-eyed martial art! Let me know who I am!”

“Hmm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. The youth’s attitude stirred a flicker of anger within him, his gaze turning unkind. However, recalling the elder could crush him with a single palm, Luo Tian held back, his eyes glowing with violet energy as he gazed at Diao Dezhù.

When Luo Tian saw the youth’s true form, his face changed drastically, his eyes filled with intense disbelief.

“Do you remember now? You’ve forgotten this noble Mysterious Ghost Badger!” Diao Dezhù, seeing Luo Tian’s expression, knew he had remembered. He snarled at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian finally recalled: the youth before him was the Mysterious Ghost Badger that had been sealed beneath the Divine Gate, which he hadn’t captured and had even been wounded by. It had escaped.

“Uh…” Luo Tian was at a loss, unable to connect this sly Diao Dezhù with the Mysterious Ghost Badger from before.

“Hmph. Come on, I’ve just awakened. Now that I’ve recovered my true strength, if you can still injure me, I’ll call you grandpa!” The Mysterious Ghost Badger’s face bore pride as he looked at Luo Tian, who was in the Super-Immortal realm.

“Smack…” The elder, who had remained silent until now, finally erupted in anger. He extended his hand and slapped Diao Dezhù’s head, nearly sending him underground.

“Foolish brat! How dare you bet on me? Who gave you the guts!” The elder spoke solemnly, his words causing everyone’s mouths to twitch.

“What kind of ancestor must you have? You’re not a good one either!” Gu Lei and others secretly marveled, but no one dared to laugh out loud.

“Grandpa, do you think this kid can beat me?” Diao Dezhù’s face bore anger as he looked at the elder.

“Then why did you dare to bet on me? Damn it, if you say I lose and call me grandpa, I’ll beat the hell out of you. How could your parents give birth to such a thing? If it weren’t for the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan’s single-line inheritance, I would have beaten you to death!” The elder’s face bore anger as he spoke to Diao Dezhù.

“Pfft…” Hearing the elder’s words, Gu Lei and others finally couldn’t hold back, spitting out their breaths with admiration toward the elder.

“Luo Tian, you still laugh? Dare to fight me? If I lose, I’ll be your steed!” Diao Dezhù, of course, wouldn’t dare defy his grandfather. His face bore anger as he looked at Luo Tian and spoke loudly.

“Are you sure? What if I accidentally win?” Luo Tian’s eyes held a slight smile as he spoke to Diao Dezhù.

“Win? How could that be? You’re just a kid. I was at half-step Saint before, and now look at me—I’m half-step Saint! What about you? Super-Immortal! If you win, I’ll still be your steed!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore a slight sneer as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Idiot, are you really from the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan!” The elder patted his head in exasperation, looking at Diao Dezhù with a headache. However, his grandson had already spoken the words, and due to status, the elder could only gesture silently. Diao Dezhù obviously didn’t notice, his face bearing an invincible expression.

“Good!” Luo Tian’s face bore a smile as he took out a miniature array flag from his sleeve and handed it to Wan Lingkong.

“Buzz…” The atmosphere surged. Without the array flag’s concealment, Luo Tian’s cultivation and aura instantly burst forth—Saint peak initial stage. This was sensed by Diao Dezhù.

Diao Dezhù’s face still bore an invincible expression, but as he sensed Luo Tian’s aura rising, his mouth unconsciously opened wide with disbelief.

Luo Tian paid no heed. His hands rapidly changed, the Zhen Tian Seal accompanied by the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique, instantly appearing above everyone’s heads. The terrifying power could annihilate a half-step Saint. Luo Tian smiled: “You seem to have lost!”

“Buddha Heaven Attack Technique!” As Luo Tian unleashed the Zhen Tian Seal, the elder in purple robes’ eyes flashed with sharp light. His gaze fell on Luo Tian.

...

Chapter 931: Oppression

In the Holy City of the Demon Domain, within the Rhino Clan’s territory, a sky-shaking pressure struck people. A sun-like Zhen Tian Seal hovered above, making Diao Dezhù tremble involuntarily.

“Saint… Saint peak initial!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have reached Saint peak initial so quickly. When he had seen Luo Tian in the Divine Gate Continent, he was merely at Super-Immortal.

Only a few years had passed, and Luo Tian had reached Saint peak initial. This cultivation speed was terrifying.

“You’re cheating! You’ve hidden your cultivation level. It doesn’t count!” Diao Dezhù didn’t look at the sky’s Zhen Tian Seal. He knew his gap with Luo Tian was too great.

“Let’s stop. It’s not interesting. Not a level match!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore a sly expression, speaking softly.

“Spit! You’re really shameless. Where’s your invincible aura from before!” Zheng Xin and others, seeing the elder didn’t intervene, resumed mocking Diao Dezhù.

“You don’t understand. I want a level match. Facing a Saint peak initial, I can only tie. It’s not interesting!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore a touch of loneliness, crossing his arms and speaking to Zheng Xin.

“Invincibility is so lonely. I thought this kid would fight me a battle that shook heaven and earth, but he’s already reached Saint peak initial. Alas, loneliness. When I reach Saint peak initial, I’ll fight you a battle that shook heaven and earth!” Diao Dezhù seemed to gain more energy, speaking again.

Luo Tian was speechless at Diao Dezhù’s behavior. He thought back to their first meeting, when the latter had transformed into a snow phoenix and pretended to be an invincible sage.

“Damn, I only respect you for bragging. This level of bragging is truly unmatched!” Gu Lei and others looked at Diao Dezhù with admiration.

“Who are you to Gu Tianyu? Why do you know the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique!” Diao Dezhù’s grandfather waved his hand, dispersing Luo Tian’s Zhen Tian Seal. After all, the Zhen Tian Seal was too eye-catching; other beasts had curiosity and were looking over.

Luo Tian thought for a moment before speaking softly: “I merely received some inheritance from the elder Gu!”

“Hmph. Continue!” The elder sighed, no longer paying attention to everyone and returning to his place.

Luo Tian couldn’t fathom the elder’s intentions, but since he was clearly weaker, he could only watch this unreliable Diao Dezhù act recklessly.

“Let’s keep the bet. However, this kid can step down. Let your side find someone who is also half-step Saint to fight. That would be fairer! Let you see what true level match invincibility looks like!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore arrogance. He scanned everyone before settling on the youngest one, Long Jie.

“You! Come out!” Diao Dezhù waved his finger at Long Jie, a look of pride on his face.

Actually, Du Yuying was younger, but since she was a girl, Diao Dezhù still had some dignity.

Among Luo Tian’s group, Nan Gong Yuying, Gu Lei, Long Jie, and Tian Luo were at half-step Saint. Among them, Nan Gong Yuying radiated blood energy and was clearly no easy opponent. Tian Luo was cold to others, also not an easy opponent. Gu Lei looked like no good guy. Only Long Jie appeared youthful and innocent, like a soft plum to be squeezed.

Diao Dezhù wanted to establish authority and prestige. Naturally, he chose the one who looked most vulnerable—Long Jie.

“Not allowed!” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly, directly refusing. If Long Jie fought Diao Dezhù, his Dragon Clan identity would be exposed. Luo Tian didn’t know what consequences that might bring.

“Don’t you dare? Ha! Truly lonely. Invincibility is so lonely, you won’t understand!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore slight sneer as he looked at Long Jie.

Hearing Luo Tian so fiercely protect Long Jie, Diao Dezhù was even more certain that Long Jie was the weakest among them. His eyes held mockery as he glanced at Long Jie.

“Boom…” Long Jie was a Dragon Clan member, proud and unyielding. Being looked down upon by a beast, he naturally felt uncomfortable. Diao Dezhù’s last glance completely ignited the young Long Jie, who took a step forward in front of Luo Tian.

“Brother, let me handle him!” Long Jie’s eyes burned with battle intent. He hadn’t fought in a long time and was itching for action.

“Alas…” Seeing Long Jie’s determined gaze, Luo Tian knew he couldn’t stop this kid. He nodded slightly, his body tense and hands ready to teleport them away immediately if anything happened.

“Begin!” Long Jie sneered, wielding no weapon. His fists glowed with golden light, and a massive pressure radiated from him. This pressure carried ferocity and a king’s aura, making Diao Dezhù frown.

As Long Jie’s aura spread, Diao Dezhù felt his own spiritual energy stall and slow down.

“Can it really suppress me?” Diao Dezhù’s eyes held concern. As a beast of the Eight Holy Clans, his senses were far superior to humans. He felt immediate regret upon sensing Long Jie’s aura.

“Roar…” Long Jie roared, his voice shaking the heavens. Golden light radiated from him, illuminating the sky.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He knew Long Jie was about to reveal his true form. The kid had been too long without fighting and wanted to know his identity in this Demon Domain. The purple-robed elder’s high status would surely reveal many secrets.

The roar shook the heavens, golden dragons coiling above people’s heads. Dragon energy filled the air, a superior aura overwhelming everyone.

“Boom… Boom…” The heavy sound echoed. Even Rhino Clan members, including Sun Hongda at Saint peak initial, wore expressions of fear as they gazed at the hundred-foot golden dragon—Long Jie’s true form.

“Dragon… Dragon Clan!” The Rhino Clan members fell to the ground, regardless of cultivation. It was a pressure from blood and lineage that made them unable to resist the slightest rebellion.

“Not ordinary Dragon Clan. Bloodline is at its peak. Damn, why do I feel such a strong pressure? No will to resist!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore endless fear. Purple energy radiated from him, countering the soul-shaking震慑. Though he didn’t kneel, he clearly had no ability to fight anymore.

“Dragon Ancestor!” Diao Dezhù’s grandfather bore disbelief, then turned to joy. He waved his hand, purple energy spreading and enveloping the entire Rhino Clan’s territory, ensuring no trace of Long Jie’s aura escaped.

“Hmph?” At the moment Long Jie’s true form appeared, elders of the other Seven Holy Clans in the Holy City opened their eyes. Their faces bore solemnity, gazing at the void with furrowed brows.

“Why do I feel a familiar yet terrifying aura? Though only for a moment, something must have appeared!” In the Phoenix Clan’s ancestral grounds, an elder sat in black flames, speaking solemnly. Then his powerful spiritual sense swept across the entire Holy City without finding anything special.

Not only the Phoenix Clan, but the entire Holy City was scoured by several powerful spiritual senses. Sometimes they collided, eventually exchanging默契 without finding anything special.

“Dragon Ancestor! Dragon Ancestor is still alive!” The purple-robed elder’s face bore excitement, sensing the bloodline pressure radiating from Long Jie. He spoke loudly.

“Dragon Ancestor, it was said that the Dragon Ancestor perished in the battle against the Demon Domain!” Sun Hongda’s eyes bore shock, lying on the ground as he gazed at Long Jie in the sky and asked aloud.

Other Rhino Clan members also lay on the ground, their eyes filled with disbelief. There was a legend in the Demon Domain that the Dragon Ancestor, the former ruler of the domain, had perished in a battle against the Demon Domain. Hearing the purple-robed elder call Long Jie the Dragon Ancestor, they found it hard to believe.

Yet the soul and bloodline pressure was undeniable. They could not resist, even lacking the courage to speak.

“Damn!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore regret. He had intended to show off, defeating Long Jie and showing his prowess. But first, Luo Tian’s Saint peak initial had surprised him. Then came a Dragon Clan member. His grandfather even called this harmless kid the legendary Dragon Ancestor, leaving Diao Dezhù sighing in despair. He had truly hit bad luck.

“Luo Tian, you bastard! You’re killing me! Not only do you kill me, but even your friends are against me!” Diao Dezhù finally reached his limit, cursing Luo Tian.

“Do you know me?” Long Jie also felt the purple-robed elder might recognize him. His face bore confusion as he asked the elder.

“More than know! The Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan under Dragon Ancestor, Diao Yuanshan pays homage to the Dragon Ancestor!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore reverence, kneeling halfway as he bowed to Long Jie.

The elder showed no discomfort. His aged body was no longer indifferent but solemn, kneeling halfway as his voice echoed, stunning Luo Tian and others.

“My god! What identity does Long Jie have that even the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan’s elder would kneel in reverence!” Zheng Xin and others bore shock, not expecting Long Jie, who had lived among them, to have such a status.

...

Chapter 932: I’m Not a Dog

In the Holy City of the Demon Domain, within the Rhino Clan’s territory, the entire area was covered in purple energy. No aura was emitted. A golden dragon coiled above people’s heads, though only at half-step Saint. Yet the Rhino Clan members and even Saint peak initial beasts lay prostrate, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at Long Jie.

“Roar…” The golden dragon rolled in the sky, its long tail striking toward a purple-robed youth below.

“My mother! Grandpa save me!” Diao Dezhù saw the golden dragon’s tail and bore fear. Both he and Long Jie were at half-step Saint, but Long Jie was in his true form, at peak condition.

Diao Dezhù was suppressed and could not move. He was in human form, so the outcome was clear. If struck by Long Jie’s tail, Diao Dezhù knew he would not survive easily.

“Save you? You’re not from the Bear Clan or Leopard Clan. You have bear’s heart and leopard’s courage!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore coldness, not moving to help Diao Dezhù.

“Done…” Diao Dezhù was utterly stunned. He had never expected his grandfather to ignore him in this situation. This was beyond Diao Dezhù’s expectations.

With a thunderous sound, the golden dragon’s tail broke through space and appeared before Diao Dezhù. It was about to strike him.

“Long Jie, hold back!” As Diao Dezhù felt desperate, Luo Tian’s voice echoed. Long Jie’s massive dragon tail paused slightly.

But Luo Tian’s words were too late. The golden dragon’s tail struck Diao Dezhù, producing a crackling sound.

Diao Dezhù spat blood and was sent flying over a hundred feet before stopping. His ribs were broken, but due to Luo Tian’s interruption, Long Jie’s tail power was reduced. It did not kill Diao Dezhù.

“Huff…” Diao Dezhù sighed deeply, his eyes filled with gratitude toward Luo Tian. If not for Luo Tian’s words, that strike would have left him in a much worse state.

“Wretch! Come here!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore anger, but his eyes held a touch of gratitude as he glanced at Luo Tian. Diao Dezhù was the last bloodline of the Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan. If he died, the clan would truly be extinct.

Normally, if other clans’ beasts bullied Diao Dezhù, Diao Yuanshan would seek them out and fight. He acted like a madman.

The Mysterious Ghost Badger Clan had no power, but Diao Yuanshan’s strength was formidable. He relied solely on his presence to deter other clans, preserving the Eight Holy Clans’ status. One could imagine Diao Yuanshan’s strength.

Long Jie roared again, returning to human form. After all, if he revealed his true form, the Rhino Clan would never recover.

“Do you know me?” Long Jie’s youthful face bore confusion as he looked at Diao Yuanshan, seeking an answer.

“Of course I do. I never expected the Dragon Ancestor to still be alive. You truly are the Dragon Ancestor, surviving even that battle,” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore excitement as he stood up, gazing at Long Jie.

“Please tell me who I am! How did I end up in the Tianyuan Continent of the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Long Jie spoke solemnly.

Diao Yuanshan’s face bore a touch of sorrow, his eyes filled with沧桑. He seemed to fall into memories before finally speaking, recounting the events of long ago.

Luo Tian and others listened attentively. They knew this was a long-forgotten secret, not interrupting the elder’s recollection.

After an hour of storytelling, everyone finally understood Long Jie’s identity. Their faces bore shock as they gazed at him.

Long Jie was the former ruler of the Demon Domain, just like Gu Tianyu. He led a domain and ranked third in the Four Sacred Star Domains, astonishingly powerful.

During the Dragon Clan’s peak, how strong it was! At that time, Long Jie wasn’t called Long Jie but Dragon Zhan Tian. His name was as bold as his character, following the path of a prodigy who dominated his era. The entire Demon Domain knew Dragon Zhan Tian. At Saint peak initial, he entered the Ancient Heaven Palace and was the only one to emerge alive. No one could match him, eventually achieving Saint peak and ruling a domain.

Compared to Gu Tianyu, Dragon Zhan Tian reached Saint peak later but was a rising star. When Gu Tianyu toured the Demon Domain, they had sparred and ended in a draw. At that time, Dragon Zhan Tian had just reached Saint peak, while Gu Tianyu was a veteran strongman across nine domains.

Finally, the Demon Domain’s Nine Saints caused chaos. Four Saint peak masters attacked the Demon Domain. Dragon Zhan Tian led the domain in a fierce battle against the four Saint peaks, sacrificing heavily to preserve the domain’s legacy. Dragon Zhan Tian eventually perished. The Dragon Clan’s relic, a pearl of inheritance, traversed space and disappeared.

“Ah! I see now!” Luo Tian understood after Diao Yuanshan’s story. That was why Long Jie had appeared in the Four Sacred Star Domains.

It must have been Dragon Zhan Tian’s dragon pearl that had traversed into the Great An Forest of the Four Sacred Star Domains. It coincidentally benefited Long Jie’s parents, allowing their child to gain the benefits—now Long Jie.

Long Jie’s face still bore confusion. His eyes were cold: “I am Long Jie, not Dragon Zhan Tian!”

His tone was icy but resolute. He could not abandon Long Jie’s parents, who had raised him. He did not want to be the Demon Domain’s ruler but wished to adventure across star domains with Luo Tian. His desire to know the truth was merely curiosity.

Hearing Long Jie’s words, Diao Yuanshan’s face bore a bitter smile: “I suppose now the Dragon Ancestor cannot acknowledge himself, nor can he reveal his aura. I felt something strange about your death. You were so mighty back then. Even four Saint peaks should not have killed you. Yet it was inexplicably tragic, making me suspect there was a traitor!”

Diao Yuanshan’s face turned cold. His voice was like ice, gazing at the eight life-like statues in the Holy City.

Luo Tian’s face also turned cold. He hadn’t expected the Demon Domain to be so complex. Though Long Jie insisted he was not Dragon Zhan Tian, Luo Tian knew now Long Jie was Dragon Zhan Tian. Or rather, it was a fusion of Long Jie and Dragon Zhan Tian. If this were revealed, it would definitely be dangerous.

Luo Tian glanced at the Rhino Clan people, his face thoughtful. So many people would spread this explosive news. To protect the secret, only one method remained: killing them.

But the Rhino Clan had been kind to him. It was a debt of gratitude, so Luo Tian felt conflicted.

Seeming to sense Luo Tian’s dilemma, Sun Hongda was a beast who had reached Saint peak initial. His mind was nearly demonic. He wore a bitter expression.

“Don’t resist. I’ll erase your memories. Whoever resists, I’ll kill them!” Diao Yuanshan was强势, his face cold. He waved his hand, and purple energy flew from it, forming arrows that shot into the Rhino Clan’s minds. They erased everything they had seen and heard.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian bore gratitude as he bowed to Diao Yuanshan.

“You’re welcome. I can see the Dragon Ancestor relies on you and listens to your words. I hope when you emerge from the Ancient Heaven Palace, the Dragon Ancestor will train with me for a while!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore a request as he bowed to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian quickly stopped Diao Yuanshan: “Elder, it’s your duty. Long Jie follows me, but that’s not suitable. After all, I am human and lack the cultivation methods of beasts!”

“No, I just want the Dragon Ancestor to fully awaken his dragon bloodline. I suppose the Dragon Ancestor already knows the cultivation methods. I can’t teach him!” Diao Yuanshan smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Good. Then when we emerge from the Ancient Heaven Palace, Long Jie will be entrusted to you!” Luo Tian’s face bore respect as he accepted.

“Dragon Ancestor… Eight Holy Clans…” Long Jie’s face turned cold. Though he didn’t know how exactly he had been betrayed, he instinctively held no goodwill toward the Eight Holy Clans.

“The Eight Holy Clans also have those who revere the Dragon Ancestor. But I don’t yet know which clans were involved in this treachery. So the Dragon Ancestor must remain low-key. My unworthy grandson has good escape skills. Let him stay with you!” Diao Yuanshan grabbed Diao Dezhù and threw him before Luo Tian’s group. Then he stood up to prepare for awakening Long Jie’s bloodline.

“Grandpa…” Seeing Diao Yuanshan had left him alone, Diao Dezhù felt a bad premonition.

“Haha, Diao Brother, come on. No fight no friendship! We’ve got a connection. Let’s get to know each other!” Zheng Xin pulled Diao Dezhù forward, his face glowing with excitement.

“Diao Brother, can you transform into your true form? Let us see!” Luo Tian’s face bore contemplation as he looked at Diao Dezhù.

Diao Dezhù had initially refused, but after seeing Long Jie’s cold gaze, he smiled. Purple energy spread as he transformed into a half-foot-long purple fox.

“Hmph, I last saw you black. Now that you’ve reached Super-Immortal, you’ve turned purple! Purple is much better than black!” Luo Tian smiled slightly. He grabbed a jade pendant and placed it under Diao Dezhù’s nose.

“Hear you’re called the Soul-Seeking Fox. Can you find people?” Luo Tian’s face bore anticipation as he looked at Diao Dezhù.

“Damn…” Diao Dezhù’s black eyes bore endless anger. Luo Tian’s actions clearly treated him like a dog.
