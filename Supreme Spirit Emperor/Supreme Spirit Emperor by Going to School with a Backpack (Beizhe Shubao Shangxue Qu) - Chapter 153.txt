Two figures seemed to have an unspoken understanding, moving everyone onto the ground. After all, being underground was inconvenient.

"Kill!" Upon emerging from the earth, Luo Tian and Yang Wenbin rushed at each other, their faces etched with cold expressions.

"Crack..." Thunder roared as the Three-Pointed Two-Edged Sword clashed with the Splitting-the-Sky Spear. Luo Tian took two steps back, his face displaying a flicker of surprise.

On the other side, Yang Wenbin's expression was one of shock. His body shot through the air like lightning, flying a thousand zhang before exiting Luo Tian's domain.

"How could it be? A single strike sent Senior Brother Yang flying!" One of Yang Wenbin's companions exclaimed, astonishment etched on his face. It was the first time he had seen Yang Wenbin so thoroughly outmatched by someone below the Supreme Stage.

The woman named Long Haoyue, however, had sharp eyes. Her gaze on Luo Tian shifted from excitement to contemplation.

Wiping blood from his lips, Yang Wenbin's face turned solemn. He locked eyes with Luo Tian: "Nine-Attribute Body!"

Though the multi-attribute body was rare on the Celestial Yuan Continent, it wasn't uncommon on the White Tiger Continent. Yang Wenbin himself possessed a four-attribute body. Yet he had never encountered such an overwhelming nine-attribute body.

Luo Tian might not have understood the significance of a nine-attribute body, but Yang Wenbin and Long Haoyue did.

After entering the Realm-Transcending Stage, one's body type seemed less significant as it eventually transformed into chaotic energy. However, once reaching the Supreme Stage, one's body type became crucial—it enhanced one's ability to grasp the Dao.

For instance, Luo Tian's nine-attribute body meant that once he achieved Supreme Status, his understanding of each attribute would be immeasurably swift. He had a chance to become the Nine-Origin Supreme.

Nine-Origin Supremes were rare even on the White Tiger Continent. Their power could shatter heaven and earth. Yang Wenbin knew that even the sect's ancestral ancestor, an Eight-Origin Supreme, hadn't reached Nine. Other neighboring continents' strongest warriors were at most Eight or Seven Origins. A Nine-Origin Supreme was like an insurmountable barrier—no one had ever achieved it.

Yang Wenbin was certain that this young man, so unnaturally youthful, would be treasured if he joined their sect.

"Long Haoyue, join me. Let's kill her!" Yang Wenbin's face bore a hint of malice. His only weakness was the woman beside him, and he couldn't stand anyone surpassing him.

"Good!" Hearing Yang Wenbin's call, Long Haoyue's face softened. Her recently ascended Realm-Transcending Stage power surged as she followed Yang Wenbin.

"White Tiger Transformation!" Yang Wenbin roared, his aura surging. His gaze held mockery as he transformed into a half-step Supreme.

"Secret Technique?" Luo Tian's face slightly changed. He had a secret technique—his previous "Soul-Consuming Method." But as his strength grew, the method's benefits had become negligible. He hadn't used it.

Yet now, seeing someone employ a secret technique—enhancing their body to the level of one Origin Supreme within the Realm-Transcending Stage—it left Luo Tian astounded.

"Kill!" At this point, Luo Tian truly regarded Yang Wenbin as an opponent. His mind was more cautious than before. Moreover, there was the woman who made him feel even more wary.

Though she had just entered the Realm-Transcending Stage, her presence felt unfathomable.

"Kill!" Yet Luo Tian remained undaunted. His battle spirit surged as he faced his first fight since leaving the Celestial Yuan Continent.

At the same time, Luo Tian felt immense resentment. His master, the Demon Lord, and others had died. His loved ones and friends were sealed away. He was alone, feeling an unbearable sense of frustration.

"Long Haoyue, stay behind me!" Yang Wenbin held his Three-Pointed Two-Edged Sword like a war god, standing in front of Long Haoyue with a solemn expression.

"Good!" Long Haoyue still wore a gentle smile, gripping a green sword in her hand.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian's Four-Pronged Splitting-the-Sky Spear surged with immense power toward Yang Wenbin and Long Haoyue.

"Poof..." In the blink of an eye, Luo Tian witnessed something unbelievable. Amid his spear's shadow, Long Haoyue's eyes flashed with endless hatred as she plunged her green sword into Yang Wenbin's back.

"Roar..." A blue dragon-shaped illusion rose from Long Haoyue's sword, devouring Yang Wenbin's three soul fragments.

"You..." Yang Wenbin hadn't even finished speaking before vanishing into the void, leaving everyone in shock.

Especially Yang Wenbin's subordinates, their faces filled with disbelief. None had expected this outcome.

Yang Wenbin and Long Haoyue were known as a couple in the White Tiger Sect. People knew they were deeply affectionate. Even this mission, Yang Wenbin had given Long Haoyue his share of the cultivation opportunity. He would have died for her, but he never imagined dying at her hands.

Luo Tian was also stunned. He had planned to expend some effort to deal with them, but instead, they turned on each other.

"Haha, I think we should get to know each other. My name is Long Haoyue!" The woman smiled, as if transformed, addressing Luo Tian with a calm voice.

"Luo Tian." Luo Tian's brows furrowed. Honestly, he was wary of this woman. It wasn't about her strength but the fact she had laughed with Yang Wenbin moments ago and then killed him. Such a person was likely heartless.

"Long Haoyue! Who are you? Why did you do this?" Yang Wenbin's subordinates looked terrified, gazing at Long Haoyue. They wanted to flee but knew they couldn't escape from a Realm-Transcending Stage master.

"Who am I? The Azure Dragon has appeared. Don't you know who I am yet?" Long Haoyue's face bore hatred, her gaze playful as she looked at Yang Wenbin's subordinates.

"You're from the Azure Dragon Continent! You should die!" The White Tiger Sect members' faces showed fear, revealing Long Haoyue's identity.

"Azure Dragon Continent?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He truly knew too little about the outside world. He hadn't even understood the White Tiger Continent, and now another Azure Dragon Continent had appeared.

"Correct. But you won't have the chance!" Long Haoyue smiled, her beauty reaching perfection, even making Luo Tian momentarily dazed.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Blood splattered across the Black Rock Continent, leaving only Luo Tian and Long Haoyue.

"I think we aren't enemies, right?" Long Haoyue looked at Luo Tian's solemn gaze and smiled lightly. Her red lips curled, her waist swayed as she appeared before Luo Tian.

"But we aren't friends either!" Luo Tian subtly retreated a few steps. He had smelled the faint fragrance on Long Haoyue, recalling how Jiao Lerong had marked him, causing a series of troubles.

"I think we can become friends. You're an independent cultivator; I can help you!" Long Haoyue smiled softly.

"How can you help me? If my guess is right, Yang Wenbin's status on the White Tiger Continent must be high. You killed him; you'll face endless pursuit. How can you help me when you're in danger yourself?" Luo Tian asked, voicing his confusion.

"These people weren't killed by me. It was you!" Long Haoyue smiled, her voice confident.

Luo Tian laughed loudly, his tone filled with supreme authority. He gazed at Long Haoyue: "If you say it was me, then so be it. But I don't mind killing one more!"

Luo Tian's form flickered like a tyrant, his steps echoing the "Sealing Heaven Step," instantly appearing before Long Haoyue. His hand shot out, grasping her neck.

"Three breaths. Give me a perfect explanation, or don't blame me for destroying you!" Luo Tian's eyes were deep, as if seeing through Long Haoyue.

Chapter 744: Azure Dragon Continent

Seeing Luo Tian subdue her instantly, Long Haoyue's face showed no anger but instead excitement.

"One breath!" Luo Tian ignored it, his cold voice like a winter wind in Long Haoyue's heart, making her tremble slightly.

Long Haoyue had just ascended to the Realm-Transcending Stage. Even though she killed Yang Wenbin, it was in his unguarded moment. Otherwise, even several Long Haoyues couldn't have killed him.

Luo Tian was a true half-step Supreme. His powerful soul energy brought pressure comparable to the Supreme Stage.

"Ah cough... I can give you an identity—Azure Dragon Continent's identity. A status that others on the Azure Dragon Continent can't even dream of!" Long Haoyue suppressed her fear, addressing Luo Tian.

"Still not enough!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. The White Tiger Sect was clearly no easy opponent. A mere identity wasn't enough for Luo Tian to risk his life.

Seeing Luo Tian's lack of interest, Long Haoyue mentally cursed: "You didn't even listen to what the identity was before saying it's not enough!"

"The Azure Dragon Sect, Sixth-Origin Supreme Disciple! This identity is enough for you to dominate the Azure Dragon Continent!" Long Haoyue's face showed confidence as she addressed Luo Tian.

"Five-Origin Supreme?" Upon hearing Long Haoyue's words, Luo Tian was secretly shocked. Yet his grip on her neck tightened.

"I said it's still not enough! Are you deaf?" Luo Tian's voice remained cold, but his mind was slightly swayed.

"Little girl, you want to use me. You need to offer more blood before I'm satisfied!" Luo Tian knew this Long Haoyue's identity was definitely not ordinary. Otherwise, a mere Realm-Transcending Stage cultivator wouldn't dare make such bold claims.

Seeing Luo Tian's lack of interest, Long Haoyue grew furious. If someone rejected the chance to become a Sixth-Origin Supreme Disciple, they'd admire Luo Tian's courage. Especially since it was the terrifying Azure Dragon Sect.

"Add a hidden treasure ground. We can explore together when we enter the Realm-Transcending Stage. There's a chance to reach Nine-Origin Supreme, but I can't promise it'll definitely happen. After all, Nine-Origin Supremes are too hard!" Long Haoyue bit her lip, a reluctant expression on her face.

"I also want this kid's White Tiger Transformation!" Luo Tian spoke solemnly, his gaze unchanged.

"Deal!" Long Haoyue's face slightly changed before nodding gently.

"Indeed, a formidable woman!" Luo Tian smiled, changing his expression. Even becoming an Eight-Origin Supreme would satisfy him. He knew that even if the imperial-robed man from the Epoch Book had immense power, an Eight-Origin Supreme was still rare on higher continents. If he reached that level, he'd be fearless against the imperial-robed man.

Seeing Luo Tian's smiling face, Long Haoyue was furious. She had thought she was skilled at changing faces, but this man's face-changing ability matched hers.

"Hmph!" Long Haoyue sneered, tossing a storage bag into Luo Tian's hands. She spoke softly: "Inside are the things you need to enter the Azure Dragon Sect. Just give this jade slip to the sect leader, and he'll arrange everything for you!" Long Haoyue explained to Luo Tian.

Under Luo Tian's pressure, Long Haoyue also swore a blood oath. After all, Luo Tian didn't trust this woman who had brought him danger.

"Remember what I said. After leaving, go to the Azure Dragon Continent quickly. Don't linger in the void; otherwise, you'll face a Supreme Stage pursuit. No one can save you!" Long Haoyue repeatedly warned before vanishing.

Seeing Long Haoyue's disappearing figure, Luo Tian's eyes showed contemplation. He knew they were just trading. He needed the Azure Dragon Continent identity and to familiarize himself with life beyond the Celestial Yuan Continent. Long Haoyue needed him to take on the blame for her killings.

Luo Tian didn't know Long Haoyue's purpose in infiltrating the White Tiger Sect, but he knew she had grand ambitions.

"Unknown what you're scheming. I hope you don't scheme against me; otherwise, even if my strength isn't enough now, I'll make a mess of your Azure Dragon Sect!" Luo Tian muttered, his hands moving swiftly.

"Buzz..." A figure of Luo Tian appeared before him—his clone.

With the clone's appearance, Luo Tian's original body dropped to the Realm-Transcending Stage, no longer a half-step Supreme.

His clone possessed the peak of the Soul-Transcending Stage, smiling as he looked at his original body.

"This is my first time using a clone!" Both voices echoed from Luo Tian's original and clone.

"The dense dark energy here on the Black Rock Continent shouldn't be wasted!" Luo Tian's original body moved his hands, and runes flew from them. Finally, a Wind Thunder Tree leaf landed on his clone's body.

"Let the clone absorb energy here. The original will go to the Azure Dragon Continent!" As runes surrounded his clone and the Wind Thunder Tree leaf fell, he vanished. Luo Tian was confident even a Supreme Stage master couldn't detect him.

"Go! If I don't leave now, I might not be able to!" Luo Tian smiled softly, his body transforming into a long rainbow and vanishing.

At the same time, Luo Tian's clone vanished too, rushing deep underground. Closing his eyes, he sat at the center of the Black Rock Continent, absorbing dark energy fervently.

...

Luo Tian didn't stop for a moment. He knew Long Haoyue wouldn't lie about killing Yang Wenbin. If he was caught, she'd expose him; neither would escape.

Following the map in Long Haoyue's storage bag, Luo Tian flew straight to a dark void. His face showed admiration.

According to Long Haoyue's introduction, he finally understood this area had four continents: Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Phoenix, and Black Tortoise. These four were called the Four Sacred Continents. Their strengths were similar but had mutual hostility.

"This is truly a continent!" Luo Tian gazed at the endless dark void, admiration in his eyes. He could sense this vast void surrounded a massive planet—probably the Azure Dragon Continent Long Haoyue mentioned.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian flew forward, directly entering the dark void. Using his perception, he traveled for about an hour before finally appearing on the Azure Dragon Continent.

"Buzz..." Energy fluctuations spread as Luo Tian appeared in the sky of the Azure Dragon Continent.

Feeling the surrounding dense energy, Luo Tian's heart trembled. He marveled at how the Azure Dragon Continent was indeed a high-level continent, its energy density ten times that of the southern region of the Celestial Yuan Continent. Most importantly, Luo Tian felt no obstacles here. If his strength was sufficient, he could definitely reach the Supreme Stage.

"That woman is mysterious. I should first familiarize myself with this Azure Dragon Continent, otherwise, even if I entered the Azure Dragon Sect as she said, though under a blood oath, it's still better to be cautious!" Luo Tian muttered, standing in the sky and gazing at the scenery below.

Around him, cultivators flew back and forth. So Luo Tian standing in the sky wasn't strange.

Luo Tian flew through the sky, his spiritual sense scanning. He sensed that even the weakest among the flying cultivators was at the Soul-Transcending Stage. He realized this Azure Dragon Continent was far more advanced than the Celestial Yuan Continent.

"Why is the Celestial Yuan Continent so weak? Not only is its energy thin, but it also can't reach the Supreme Stage?" Luo Tian's mind filled with questions as he leisurely flew through the sky.

"Hey, Realm-Transcending Stage? So young?" Just as Luo Tian flew through the sky, a voice interrupted him. His body trembled.

Light flashed, three middle-aged men appeared before Luo Tian, making his gaze slightly tense. He mentally sighed: "This is really unlucky—just arrived and met a Supreme Stage master!"

Their eyes, three vast soul essences continuously scanning Luo Tian's body. Behind them were over a dozen young people.

The dozens of youths radiated the aura of Soul-Transcending Peak. Some eyes showed excitement, others anger, and some looked at Luo Tian with a hint of schadenfreude.

"Young man, you're quite good. As an independent cultivator, so young and already a Realm-Transcending Stage master. You must have had some opportunity!" One of the one-Origin Supreme masters spoke, his voice carrying a tone like seeing a beloved pet.

Facing a one-Origin Supreme master, Luo Tian dared not be reckless. In the Celestial Yuan Continent, Realm-Transcending Stage was as high as heaven. But here on the Azure Dragon Continent, he knew he was nothing—just average.

Luo Tian didn't want to offend anyone with a strong tone and lose his life. After all, the entire continent's living beings, family, and friends were waiting for him to save. So he now understood the importance of patience.

"What's your command, Master?" Luo Tian slightly bowed, his tone respectful.

"Good boy. Meeting us is your fortune. Do you know the Azure Dragon Sect? Now there's an opportunity for you to join it, a chance to ascend quickly!" One of the one-Origin Supreme masters spoke, his voice carrying condescension.

"Latecomer, I'm used to being independent. I don't want to join a sect for now. Master's kindness is appreciated!" Luo Tian felt a chill, sensing something bad was about to happen.

"Hmm?" Hearing Luo Tian's answer, the three one-Origin Supreme masters furrowed their brows, faces showing displeasure.

Chapter 745: Attendant

Luo Tian stood in the sky, gazing at the three middle-aged men, unsure of their intentions.

"We are Azure Dragon Sect elders. We came down from the Azure Dragon Mountains to find promising youths and recruit them into the Azure Dragon Sect. Isn't this your fortune?" The three middle-aged men spread out, subtly surrounding Luo Tian.

Hearing the middle-aged men's words, the dozens of youths behind them sighed. They knew the truth—this was merely a facade of the Azure Dragon Sect.

The Azure Dragon Sect dominated the entire Azure Dragon Continent. No one dared defy its will. Whoever defied it would face a terrible fate unless they left the Azure Dragon Continent.

Each year, Supreme Stage elders from the Azure Dragon Mountains descended to invite talented youths into the Azure Dragon Sect. In reality, they were seeking strong attendants for the sect's prodigies.

Attendants were essentially slaves. If their master ordered them to die, they had no choice but to do so. Though attendants were called such, their status was high in the Azure Dragon Sect. Some prodigies' attendants were even higher than some elders.

But those with such status in the entire Azure Dragon Sect were rare. Most were just pawns of the prodigies.

Once selected by these descending elders, no matter how talented a person was, they inevitably faced enslavement. However, Luo Tian didn't know this. He truly believed the Azure Dragon Sect elders were selecting disciples for the sect, which coincided with his plan to infiltrate the Azure Dragon Sect and investigate its nature.

But seeing the dozens of youths behind the three middle-aged men, he realized it wasn't as simple as he thought. He never believed in such a good fortune falling from the sky.

"Alas, one must bow their head under eaves!" Feeling the immense pressure from the three men, Luo Tian's breath felt slightly unsmooth. He mentally sighed.

"Boy, are you sure you don't want this fortune?" One of the middle-aged men spoke again, his gaze at Luo Tian carrying a hint of threat.

"Latecomer suddenly realized. Entering the Azure Dragon Sect is my honor. I've been independent for so long, it's time to enter the sect! Master's great kindness will be remembered forever!" Luo Tian wore a grateful expression. His mind, however, had these three men on his blacklist. If he had the chance, he'd give them a lesson they'd never forget.

Seeing Luo Tian's respectful demeanor, the three middle-aged men also changed their expressions. They secretly marveled at today's gain—finding a Realm-Transcending Stage attendant. Returning would surely earn them great rewards.

"Alright, wear this on your head. From now on, you are a disciple of the Azure Dragon Sect!" One of the middle-aged men took out a golden headband from his storage ring and handed it to Luo Tian. Luo Tian slightly tensed, examining the other dozens of youths—each had a golden headband wrapped around their heads.

"Still hesitating? Hurry up and wear it. We have to go!" The three middle-aged men showed impatience, urging Luo Tian.

"忍! 忍! 忍!" Luo Tian mentally comforted himself, tying the golden headband around his head.

"Good. From now on, you are one of the attendants of the Azure Dragon Sect's first prodigy, Jiang Sxi!" The middle-aged man saw Luo Tian wearing the headband and felt at ease.

"Attendant!" Hearing the middle-aged man's words, Luo Tian's heart shook. He recalled Long Haoyue's introduction of the Azure Dragon Sect's rules—each direct disciple could choose ten attendants. Attendants were essentially slaves.

"Curse!" Luo Tian mentally cursed. He had unknowingly become someone else's attendant. Wanting to retract, he felt the golden headband was no simple item. Now, he couldn't even break it!

"Alright, let's go. We need two more to reach twenty people. Then we can return to the Azure Dragon Mountains!" The three middle-aged men conversed, clearly satisfied with Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt helpless following the three men. He hadn't even entered the Azure Dragon Continent when he became a slave, giving him an initial defeat feeling.

Twenty people walked through the Azure Dragon Continent. Luo Tian felt its vastness and population's abundance, far surpassing the Celestial Yuan Continent. Within half a day, under the coercion and temptation of the three middle-aged men, three more Soul-Transcending Peak cultivators who had grasped a bit of chaotic energy were given yellow headbands.

"Alright, let's go back!" Seeing they had twenty people, the three middle-aged men waved their hands. Leading those with golden headbands, they flew toward the central region of the Azure Dragon Continent.

The golden headbands fluttered in the wind, appearing unusually noticeable. Naturally, when people saw Luo Tian's group, some showed admiration while others looked down.

Though they were attendants, they had finally entered the Azure Dragon Sect. Some people dreamed of entering this dominant sect on the Azure Dragon Continent.

Luo Tian ignored others' surprised glances, observing his nineteen companions. Their greatest feature was youth. Such young cultivators were common on the White Tiger Continent but still considered strong, with an unlimited future.

With no need to search for attendants, the twenty people flew faster. Within a day, they reached the heart of the Azure Dragon Continent—Jiang Sxi's location at the foot of the Azure Dragon Mountains.

Luo Tian marveled at the massive mountain peak, towering like a coiled dragon. People stood around it, their gazes filled with reverence as they looked at the Azure Dragon Mountains.

"These are people wanting to join the Azure Dragon Sect. You're lucky—no test, directly entering the Azure Dragon Sect. Though your status is a bit low, if you truly have talent, you'll have a chance to rise. Don't forget our three masters' kindness!" One of the middle-aged men spoke, addressing Luo Tian's group.

"Yes! We'll never forget your masters' kindness!" A young man spoke, his face showing flattery. Luo Tian and the others slightly frowned.

"Alright, follow me in!" Luo Tian's group of twenty followed the three men into the vast Azure Dragon Mountains.

Upon entering, the Azure Dragon Sect's disciples bowed to the three men. Though these people were young, some as young as teenagers, their auras sent shivers through Luo Tian's heart.

The surrounding people looked at Luo Tian's group with deep disdain. Clearly, attendants' status was low unless under special circumstances in the Azure Dragon Mountains.

This gaze reminded Luo Tian of when he was a useless person at Feiyun Sect, and how the Feiyun Sect disciples had looked at him.

"Servants. Attendants. It seems I have a real connection with this status!" Luo Tian sighed, his face expressionless.

"Hey, the attendant's talent isn't bad. There's even one at Realm-Transcending Stage!" The surrounding Azure Dragon Sect disciples murmured, casting a few more glances at Luo Tian.

"That's right. You don't know who it is. This is for our Azure Dragon Sect's first prodigy, Jiang Sxi! These are truly lucky slaves!" People pointed and gossiped, looking at Luo Tian's group like animals.

Luo Tian's group walked on. The name Jiang Sxi was mentioned most often, sparking great interest in Luo Tian.

Jiang Sxi, the Azure Dragon Sect's first prodigy. Three-Origin Supreme. He had grasped the Dao of water, fire, and wind. Even some three-Origin Supreme elders couldn't match Jiang Sxi's strength. Luo Tian recalled Long Haoyue's introduction of the Azure Dragon Sect, which had only introduced Jiang Sxi among the younger generation.

"Powerful. Indeed, there's always a higher mountain!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He had thought his half-step Supreme status was extraordinary, but on the Azure Dragon Continent, there were countless stronger youths.

Passing through pavilions and courtyards, the three one-Origin Supreme masters wore a respectful expression as they entered a courtyard.

The small courtyard was elegant. Over ten attendants with golden headbands moved around it, coming and going. These attendants had at least the Soul-Transcending Peak stage. Seeing the three one-Origin Supreme masters, a Soul-Transcending Peak disciple who had grasped a bit of chaotic energy stepped forward to greet them.

"Master Lang!" The attendant's voice carried respect, but only a little. One-Origin Supreme masters were merely average in the Azure Dragon Sect.

"Ah, we've come to deliver attendants for Jiang Sxi. Also, to congratulate him on entering the Three-Origin Supreme!" The middle-aged man spoke, addressing the attendant.

"Enter, please!" A voice like heavenly music rang out. The three Supreme masters wore a respectful expression.

"Please come in!" The attendant's body trembled, leading the three masters and Luo Tian into the courtyard's depths. A faint fragrance made Luo Tian and the other attendants feel refreshed.

Guided by the attendant, they arrived at a peach garden. Though it was winter, peaches bloomed unusually lushly. The courtyard felt like springtime. A gentle breeze blew, petals scattered, and Luo Tian's eyes brightened.

Chapter 746: Poison Pills

Luo Tian and his group stood at the residence of Jiang Sxi, the Azure Dragon Sect's first prodigy. Their faces showed curiosity as peach blossoms flew around them, waiting for the prodigy's appearance.

Under the respectful gazes of three Supreme masters, a graceful figure appeared in their line of sight. Everyone's eyes brightened.

Pink long dress, exquisite features, a slender figure—Jiang Sxi appeared before them like a peach blossom fairy. The previous attendants' faces showed infatuation.

"Jiang Sxi, these are the twenty attendants we found for you. Congratulations on entering the Three-Origin Supreme!" The three masters spoke, their faces showing respect.

Though they were Azure Dragon Sect elders, the three knew Jiang Sxi's status was far superior. In the Azure Dragon Sect, their positions were vastly inferior to Jiang Sxi's.

"Good. There's even one at Realm-Transcending Stage. The three masters have done well!" Jiang Sxi spoke, briefly examining Luo Tian before her gaze flickered slightly. A hint of interest appeared on her face.

"These three pills, the masters may take them. The three masters have been stuck at One-Origin Supreme for years. I hope these pills help the masters break through to Two-Origin!" Jiang Sxi extended her jade hand. Three jade bottles flew from her hand, landing in the three masters' hands.

The three masters' faces lit up. Knowing Jiang Sxi's high status, their gifts were no ordinary items. Seeing Jiang Sxi stop speaking, they respectfully bowed and left Luo Tian's group behind.

"Come with me!" Jiang Sxi spoke in an imperious tone, addressing Luo Tian and the remaining nineteen disciples. She turned towards the peach garden's depths.

Luo Tian's group didn't dare to delay, following Jiang Sxi. They were all puzzled about their fate.

"Ha! I wonder how many of us will remain!" The attendant who had previously greeted the three masters said playfully, speaking softly.

Luo Tian's group followed Jiang Sxi. Her graceful figure made even Luo Tian sigh at her perfection—terrific strength, outstanding appearance. She was the ideal goddess in people's hearts.

But Luo Tian only glanced a few times. With Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, he had no further desires. His greatest wish was to become the strongest and break the seal on the Celestial Yuan Continent, as well as revive Chen Yuting completely. The Azure Dragon Sect was undoubtedly the best choice for Luo Tian.

Jiang Sxi said nothing, as if not noticing her group behind. She walked straight ahead, arriving at a clean courtyard with over ten houses.

"From now on, you'll live here. Wait for my summons!" Jiang Sxi spoke, her tone unyielding.

"Your task now is to eat this pill!" Jiang Sxi turned, a pill flying towards one of the new attendants. The attendant was surprised.

As a nine-grade alchemist, Luo Tian could sense the pill's uniqueness. Yet something felt off about it.

"Eat it! Your body should withstand this pill's power!" Jiang Sxi smiled, addressing the attendant.

A smile that bewitched a hundred beauties. The attendant was momentarily dazed, instinctively placing the pill in his mouth. But soon, his face changed dramatically, eyes filled with terror and pain.

"Poison Pill!" As a nine-grade alchemist, Luo Tian recognized the pill's nature. It was a high-level poison pill—possibly nine-grade.

"Boom..." In the confusion of everyone, the attendant at Soul-Transcending Peak suddenly cracked apart, turning into a mist of blood that scattered in the air.

"Alas... failure!" Jiang Sxi's face showed sorrow. She waved her hand, dispersing the blood mist before turning to another attendant.

"You!" Jiang Sxi spoke again with a floral smile, addressing another person.

"I won't eat it!" The attendant was also at Soul-Transcending Peak. Seeing the previous person's fate, his face showed fear and he spoke loudly.

"Boom..." In an instant, as if the sky had collapsed, immense pressure enveloped the young man. He too followed in the previous person's footsteps, turning into a mist of blood that floated in the air.

"He's researching the pill formula? This变态!" Luo Tian's eyes showed shock. He realized Jiang Sxi's purpose and wore an expression of disbelief.

Pill formulas—something countless alchemists have longed for. Luo Tian had survived multiple times because of the pill formula in the Epoch Book. Without it, he wouldn't have his current strength.

"You!" Jiang Sxi ignored the group's shocked gazes, as if she had merely crushed an ant. She addressed another Soul-Transcending Peak disciple who had grasped a bit of chaotic energy.
