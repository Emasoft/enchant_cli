“Hah! Old bird, coming to my Star Moon Divine City without a prior greeting!” A soft laugh rose over the city's skies, as an old man with a smile on his face emerged from the Divine Emperor's Hall. Behind him trailed a group of people with bizarre appearances, yet their aura was astonishingly formidable.

“Hail the Divine Guardians!” Seeing the newcomers, Luo Tian exhaled a long breath of relief, his face showing reverence. With the Star Moon Guards, he bowed respectfully to the elder.

Star Moon Divine Clan's chief Divine Guardian and head of the three, Fu Wenbin, was also a powerhouse from the Golden Crow Clan's era.

Behind Fu Wenbin stood Fu Tianba and Fu Tianqing, showing how highly the Star Moon Divine Clan regarded the Golden Crow Clan.

“Why did you come yourself?” Fu Wenbin smiled as he addressed the old Golden Crow. Clearly, they had known each other for a long time.

“In the clan it was dull, so I brought these young ones out to broaden their horizons!” The old Golden Crow's face bore a triumphant expression, gazing at the ten young men radiating formidable energy.

No wonder the old Golden Crow was triumphant; any royal clan would be proud of having ten prodigies.

“Hah! Old fool, don't gloat. Come, let's go to my place!” Fu Wenbin smiled and invited the old Golden Crow. Among those present, only Fu Wenbin could command such respect.

“Good!” The old Golden Crow nodded and led the ten Golden Crow princes to stand before Fu Wenbin.

“Friends of the Qilin Clan, if our Star Moon Divine Clan has been remiss in hospitality, please speak freely. Now that our new Star Moon Divine Emperor is about to ascend, we ask you not to cause trouble in the Star Moon City!” Fu Wenbin smiled and addressed the black-robed elder.

“Yes, Master Fu speaks truly,” the black-cloaked elder replied. Though he could swagger before others, he dared not show disrespect to Fu Wenbin. After all, his presence was only due to the old Golden Crow's favor—there was no real connection between them.

“Enough, disperse!” Fu Wenbin smiled and addressed the onlookers. His gaze then fell upon Luo Tian.

“Fu Mengchen, you may come with us. You did well this time,” Fu Wenbin nodded, his eyes showing approval.

Hearing Fu Wenbin's words, the old Golden Crow turned his gaze to Luo Tian, scrutinizing him carefully before a look of surprise crossed his face. His eyes met Fu Wenbin's.

As Fu Wenbin spoke, the ten Golden Crow princes also showed confusion. Their gazes fell upon Luo Tian as if ten blazing suns were shining on him.

Luo Tian bowed slightly, walking into the crowd behind Fu Xingyue under the astonished glances of all.

At this point, Luo Tian had truly entered the view of the ancient royal clans—but they regarded him as nothing more than a commander.

Luo Tian briefed Fu Zhiming on the matter before following Fu Xingyue, joining the multitude of ancient royal clans heading toward the Divine Emperor's Hall.

The group arrived in a grand procession, and Luo Tian saw some familiar faces. The most noticeable was Man Hun's massive form standing behind an elder. That elder, however, left Luo Tian in absolute shock.

Unlike Man Hun's massive physique, the elder appeared normal. His body was covered with strange, ancient runes exuding an eerie aura.

“Sama!” Luo Tian's mind automatically formed the word, his gaze turning serious.

“Old Man also came?” The old Golden Crow entered the hall with Fu Wenbin, spotting the elder seated before Man Hun. His brows furrowed slightly before a smile appeared on his face as he strolled over to Sama of the Man Clan.

“Unexpectedly met Sama of the Man Clan here!” Luo Tian's mind stirred, observing the elder closely before disappointment flooded him. He had previously encountered a blind old man during his midnight raid on the Man Divine Hall, mistakenly believing him to be Sama of the Man Clan. But now he realized Sama of the Man Clan was another person.

“Old Golden Crow, you're still as careless as ever! How many years has it been!” Sama of the Man Clan smiled and addressed the old Golden Crow.

“You still look like a human or a ghost!” The two greeted each other as if children, causing the onlookers to want to laugh but dare not.

“Too many ancient clans have arrived! With a few days left, I'm sure many old friends will come,” Fu Wenbin smiled and addressed the two.

“Enough, let's go to the back. These little ones seem too afraid to speak,” Fu Wenbin addressed the old Golden Crow and Sama of the Man Clan.

“Good!” The two nodded and smiled, their figures vanishing from sight.

After the three disappeared, everyone sighed deeply. The pressure from these three old men was unbearable, a soul-shaking震慑 that left them unable to breathe.

“Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, it's been a while!” Qizi'ang smiled and greeted Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, his attitude completely different from when he faced Luo Tian.

The Qilin Clan was indeed powerful, but compared to the old royal clans like Star Moon Divine and Feng Clan, they still had a slight gap in strength.

“Qizi'ang Senior, your journey is honored. If we've been remiss in hospitality, please forgive us,” Fu Xingyang, more diplomatic, used Luo Tian's words to describe him as a sly character.

“Xingyang Senior, what are you saying? A servant only. I wouldn't go to war with a servant. However, please grant me this favor and hand over the servant!” Qizi'ang's face bore a hint of menace, his gaze on Luo Tian behind Fu Xingyue, eyes filled with mockery.

“Hah! Qizi'ang, I dare to give, but I fear you dare not take!” Fu Xingyue smiled and addressed Qizi'ang.

As the two spoke, everyone's attention turned to them.

Chapter 1331: The Ceremony Begins

“How do you mean that?” Qizi'ang's brows furrowed slightly upon hearing Fu Xingyue's words, his gaze on Luo Tian filled with confusion.

“He's just a minor commander. Why won't you give me this face?” Qizi'ang's expression showed displeasure as he addressed Fu Xingyue.

“Wouldn't it be because of this boy that we lost a vial of Qilin Essence!” Qizi'ang's voice carried coldness. The Qilin Essence was of great use to him, yet the old Golden Crow had consumed it like drinking water. How could he not be heartbroken?

“Come here!” Qizi'ang's face was cold, looking down as he beckoned Luo Tian. A minor commander—he didn't believe Star Moon Divine Clan would risk a rift over him.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, coldly watching Qizi'ang as he slowly approached Fu Xingyue.

“I'll say it again: either purge the Dragon Clan's blood from your body or kneel and apologize. This matter will be settled!” Qizi'ang's face bore coldness as he addressed Luo Tian.

Behind Qizi'ang, two elder Qilin Clan members showed no expression, their gazes on Luo Tian. Their pressure pushed toward him. They were merely holding back due to his status as an elder.

“Where did this little rat come from, daring to touch my disciple!” Fu Tianqing's face was cold as he suddenly appeared before Qizi'ang, his hand swinging to strike Qizi'ang's face.

“Smack!” The crisp sound of the slap echoed through the hall. In terms of boldness, Fu Tianba inherited Fu Tianqing's traits—though in recent years Fu Tianqing had secluded himself in the Alchemy Hall, rarely showing his face.

“Boom!” Qizi'ang's pale face flew backward, collapsing onto the ground. His gaze held disbelief as he looked at Fu Tianqing standing there.

“Fu Tianqing, what do you mean by this!” The elder behind Qizi'ang's face turned grim instantly, his gaze on Fu Tianqing standing there.

“Fu Tianqing, the old Divine Emperor of Star Moon Divine Clan? Is this commander his disciple?” People's faces changed, their gazes on Luo Tian.

Fu Tianqing's name was no stranger to them. In the late era of origins, there were only so many people. Fu Tianqing was a top figure among those late-era individuals.

“Never heard of Fu Tianqing taking a disciple. When did he take this one?” People's faces showed confusion, gazing at Luo Tian.

If Luo Tian were merely a commander of the Star Moon Guards, it wouldn't be too difficult. But if Luo Tian had Fu Tianqing behind him, this matter was no longer easy to handle!

“Cough… cough…” Qizi'ang stood up, coughing out two mouthfuls of blood. Fu Tianqing hadn't landed a heavy blow—just made him cough two mouthfuls of blood. Yet Qizi'ang's face was dark and terrifying.

Chaos-like black mist spread from Qizi'ang, his gaze deep as he looked at Luo Tian. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to be Fu Tianqing's disciple. This single identity was beyond his ability to suppress.

“Old Qilin, your grandson has been troubling my disciple since appearing. You ask me what I mean? Do you think Star Moon Divine Clan is your home? Not only is he my disciple, but even a random clan member of Star Moon City, if you touch him, I won't sit idly by!” Fu Tianqing spoke loudly, his voice resounding through the hall.

Hearing Fu Tianqing's words, the Star Moon Guards standing guard in the hall trembled. Their gazes turned reverent toward Fu Tianqing.

Fu Tianqing's words intentionally used his cultivation, not only defending Luo Tian but also warning these royal clans. Star Moon Divine City was no pushover. This was Star Moon Divine City, not your royal city—better avoid trouble. Even if you're a royal clan, we won't back down.

“Qirongxiu, did you understand my words?” Fu Tianqing's gaze fell on Qirongxiu of the Qilin Clan, speaking softly.

“Master Fu, don't be so agitated. This matter was indeed our mistake. Please forgive us for this and don't hold it against my unworthy grandson,” Qirongxiu smiled, his expression changing quickly. He remembered the purpose of this journey to Star Moon Divine Clan.

If they angered Star Moon Divine Clan, their mission would fail. He suppressed his anger and bowed to Fu Tianqing.

“Zi'ang, go apologize to Master Fu's disciple!” Qirongxiu's face bore a stern expression as he addressed the trembling Zi'ang.

“Hmph…” Zi'ang's face twitched, gazing at Luo Tian standing there with a faint smile who hadn't spoken a word since. He clenched his fists tightly.

“Hurry up!” Qirongxiu gave Zi'ang a meaningful glance, his expression unpleased.

“Yes!” Zi'ang's face was grim. He took a step forward toward Luo Tian, then bowed slightly: “I was wrong earlier. Please forgive me, Master Luo!”

“Alas… Zi'ang, I told you he wouldn't dare take it. You just didn't listen. A good person gets a bad reputation!” Fu Xingyue watched Zi'ang with mockery, speaking softly.

Hearing Fu Xingyue's words, Zi'ang's face darkened further. Fu Xingyue was openly humiliating him, rubbing salt into his wound.

“Enough, rise. We are all royal clans; don't let a small matter break our harmony. I'm just a minor commander, and you can still regard me as such!” Luo Tian bowed to the crowd.

“Hmph…” Fu Xingyue now knew Luo Tian's true identity. Seeing Luo Tian perform like this, he secretly looked down on his pretentiousness, despising how seriously Luo Tian took himself as a royal clan member.

Fu Xingyue discreetly gave Luo Tian the thumbs-up, his eyes showing that in terms of acting skills, you were definitely a top-tier master of the era.

Zi'ang stood up without further words. Upon arriving in Star Moon City, he had suffered a major loss. Being embarrassed before the young prodigies of various royal clans made him feel ashamed, and his hatred toward Luo Tian grew stronger. However, he didn't show it on his face.

Luo Tian secretly smiled, sensing Zi'ang's killing intent. However, he didn't care—after the coronation ceremony ended, he would leave here for Qixing Island, fleeing via a void warship. He didn't care about these ancient royal clans; let them be sealed here.

“Enough, everyone can chat here!” Fu Tianba's voice echoed through the hall. After all, he was still the current Divine Emperor, so it was better for him to take the lead in such a situation.

Soon, many ancient clans gathered in groups, chatting and laughing. The atmosphere quickly became lively.

Luo Tian returned to his position, standing behind Fu Xingyue as if still a commander.

The elders had their places, and the younger generation also had their circles. They exchanged information continuously. This small incident caused by Luo Tian was temporarily resolved.

Time flowed slowly, and seven days passed in the blink of an eye. During these seven days, many renowned ancient clans arrived. Another royal clan, the Huntian Clan, also had representatives coming. The elders were taken away by Fu Tianqing or Fu Wenbin, while the younger prodigies sat with Fu Xingyue and others.

“Eight ancient royal clans!” Luo Tian observed the ancient clans over these days, his heart shocked by their strength.

Not to mention the elders like Fu Tianqing in the late era, even the younger generation's strength left Luo Tian astonished.

Dozens of prodigies, each radiating overwhelming energy. Especially the ten princes of the Golden Crow Clan—just sitting there gave an invisible pressure, hinting at being the top royal clan.

However, among the ten princes of the Golden Crow Clan, four hadn't matured yet. Four had reached the early era, and the rest were all at the threshold of the late era.

Four early-era individuals—each was no weaker than Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang. As for Tu Feiyang, Fan Jingyu, Man Hun, and Luo Tian, they had already met before and even fought.

As for the prodigy of the Huntian Clan, Luo Tian hadn't fought against him yet. But he could guess that his strength was formidable—royal clan prodigies were never easy to deal with.

As for the Yin Clan, they naturally hadn't come. These days, Star Moon Divine City had welcomed various royal clans, but their campaign against the Yin Clan hadn't stopped.

“Although these prodigies are troublesome, they aren’t worth worrying about. The real trouble is the elders in the middle and late eras, even those at the peak!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

The human race in the Nine Domains, including those on Qixing Island, together weren’t enough to be crushed by just two or three peak-era masters.

“Peak era!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his heart heavy. The only human he knew to be at the peak was Mad East Bo Xin, and even his emotions seemed unstable.

“Hope these royal clans are forever sealed within the Origin Domain. Otherwise, if these万族 (ten thousand tribes) enter the Nine Domains, it might be another bloody massacre. The Nine Domains now need time to recover!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, smiling as he followed Fu Xingyue.

“Boom…” Three days passed. A heavy bell sound echoed, and everyone in Star Moon Divine City showed reverence, rushing toward the city's center.

“Today is Star Xuan’s coronation day!” Fu Xingyue smiled and appeared at the gate of Star Moon Pavilion, followed by Luo Tian and Zhiyong. Behind them were 100 Star Moon Guards, flying toward the Divine Emperor's Hall.

At the same time, those ancient royal clans also heard the bell sound. Their eyes showed smiles as they appeared at the special places prepared for them by Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Wu…” Waves of energy spread, and a purple crystal throne appeared above the Divine Emperor's Hall. Fu Tianba smiled as he stood before the throne, gently touching it. After today, this throne would change hands.

Chapter 1332: Proposal

The entire Star Moon Divine City was crowded with people, watching the purple crystal throne in the sky. It represented the seat of the highest ruler of Star Moon Divine City. Though it looked luxurious, people wouldn't be deceived by its appearance because this purple crystal throne was itself a precious treasure. It had accompanied Star Moon Divine Clan since the time of their first ruler.

“Wu…” The waves returned, and a figure in purple robes appeared before everyone's eyes.

The purple imperial robe gave Fu Xingxuan a sense of authority, but it couldn't overshadow her beauty. She was still as perfect as ever, making the entire sky pale in comparison.

At the moment Fu Xingxuan appeared, the entire Star Moon Divine City seemed to stop for a moment. Only the accelerated heartbeats of people could be heard.

Fu Xingxuan was followed by her two brothers, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang. Both were equally handsome, smiling as they followed Fu Xingxuan.

Fu Xingxuan felt a little nervous. These days, her cultivation had been boosted to the early era by Star Moon Divine Clan's rare treasures.

Luo Tian stood at the front of the crowd, smiling as he watched Fu Xingxuan's magnificence. He gave her a thumbs-up.

Fu Xingxuan’s purple eyes flickered slightly, seeing Luo Tian standing there. Seeing his familiar smile, she felt a sense of security. Her lips curled slightly as she stepped forward toward Fu Tianba.

“Father!” Fu Xingxuan bowed, accompanied by her two brothers, kneeling before Fu Tianba.

“Alas… Xingxuan, you are my most beloved daughter. Honestly, I didn’t want you to become the Divine Emperor. I just wanted you to live happily as my princess, with your two brothers shielding you!”

“But there's no other way. Since you've cultivated the Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal, this responsibility must fall on your shoulders. From now on, you are the emperor of Star Moon Divine Clan!” Fu Tianba spoke softly, his gaze full of affection toward Fu Xingxuan.

“Yes!” Fu Xingxuan replied softly, her gaze on the ground. She looked at the Star Moon Divine Clan and other ancient tribes under their protection, her expression solemn.

“Enough, with these two little rascals assisting you, I can rest easy!” Fu Tianba smiled at Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue, then slowly stepped away from the purple crystal throne. His gaze indicated that Fu Xingxuan could sit on the throne.

Fu Xingxuan straightened her face, slowly approaching the massive throne and sitting on the purple crystal throne.

“Congratulations on the new emperor's coronation!” Cheers echoed throughout Star Moon Divine City. All members of Star Moon Divine Clan and those under their protection knelt, gazing at Fu Xingxuan.

At this moment, no matter if anyone opposed it or not, people knew Fu Xingxuan's throne was unshakable.

“Hah! Today, Star Moon Divine Clan’s emperor is coronated. We need a blood sacrifice. Let's use the Yin Clan's blood to offer!” A loud laugh echoed from the sky, followed by two sounds of breaking through.

Two aged figures appeared in people's sight. They were the two Divine Guardians of Star Moon Divine Clan who had been missing for days—peak-era masters.

“Hail the Divine Guardians!” Fu Tianba, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xingyang quickly bowed, their eyes showing reverence.

The two elders waved their hands. A group of disheveled figures appeared in people's sight, instantly filling the sky.

Each figure wore gray robes, their faces pale. They seemed bound by something, floating in people's sight.

“Yin Clan!” The other royal clan elders and masters in the sky showed confusion, gazing at the dense figures in the sky with puzzled expressions.

“Yes, it's the Yin Clan!” Fu Wenbin spoke softly, his voice carrying a hint of killing intent.

“The Yin Clan infiltrated our Star Moon Divine Clan's Thunder Palace, attempting to seize our Star Moon Divine Emperor. Their intentions are clear to all. They also killed our third prince and over a dozen early-era masters, as well as dozens of near-peak era individuals. This grudge has never been forgotten by Star Moon Divine Clan!” Fu Tianba's voice echoed through the sky.

“The Yin Clan has insulted Star Moon Divine Clan. How could we let it pass? These Yin Clan members have all been hiding within Star Moon Continent. Three Divine Guardians have captured them these days! Let our new emperor deal with them!” Fu Tianba's gaze fell on Fu Xingxuan, his eyes showing a hint of sorrow.

“Kill… kill… kill…” A roaring sound echoed through Star Moon Divine City. The people of Star Moon Divine City shouted loudly, their bloodlust spreading across the heavens and earth. Terrorizing killing intent made the Yin Clan members floating in the sky pale with fear.

“Kill!” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, recalling Fu Xingchen's death before her. Her eyes turned icy.

Fu Xingxuan’s words had barely finished when Fu Tianba waved his hand. A terrifying starstorm instantly flew from Fu Tianba’s hands, rushing into the Yin Clan members.

“Boom… boom… boom…” These Yin Clan members had their cultivation erased when captured. Facing Fu Tianba’s attack, who was near the late era, they couldn’t withstand it. Their bodies exploded one by one, being completely annihilated by the terrifying storm.

“Yin Clan really are unclean!” The old Golden Crow sat before Fu Wenbin, spitting out a golden fire that engulfed the Yin Clan members. Within three breaths, they vanished completely.

“Hiss…” People looked at the old Golden Crow with a lazy demeanor and gasped, their eyes filled with awe.

It wasn’t the awe of the old Golden Crow’s methods but rather his actions. Star Moon Divine Clan had uprooted the Yin Clan within Star Moon Continent, clearly preparing for a battle with them. The old Golden Crow’s intervention at this moment clearly showed his stance in favor of Star Moon Divine Clan.

Fu Xingxuan’s face paled slightly. This was her first time seeing so many people die at once—those were over ten thousand individuals, and they vanished in an instant.

“After this, you’ll encounter even bloodier scenes,” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue stood behind Fu Xingxuan, softly comforting her. Their eyes showed a hint of affection.

“I’m fine!” Fu Xingxuan replied softly, her voice only audible to her two brothers.

“Hah! Star Moon Divine Clan’s new emperor is coronated. The Qilin Clan presents a vial of Qilin Essence as a gift!” A senior Qilin Clan member smiled, waving his hand. A small jade bottle appeared before Fu Xingxuan.

“Hmph! You Qilin Clan really went all out!”

“I, the Golden Crow Clan, present a thread of my life essence…” “I, the Huntian Clan, present a strand of pure Huntian energy…” With the Qilin Clan’s lead, other royal clans and tribes also presented gifts. Each was a priceless treasure, rare even among their own royal clans.

Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang smiled as they collected the gifts. With their speed, it took half an hour to fully collect all the gifts.

“Additionally, I, the Qilin Clan, have another matter to discuss with Star Moon Divine Clan’s old emperor. We wish to arrange a marriage!” Qirongxiu smiled, gazing at Fu Tianba.

“Oh? What kind of marriage?” Fu Tianba furrowed his brows slightly, gazing at Qirongxiu. A bad feeling stirred in his heart.

“We are one of the ancient royal clans. My grandson, Qizi'ang, is a rare celestial black Qilin of the millennium. I believe you are aware of his talent!”

“So, this visit is not only to celebrate the new emperor’s coronation but also because my grandson has long admired Star Xuan. Thus, I’ve boldly come to request this marriage!” Qirongxiu smiled and addressed Fu Tianba.

“This is the dowry I’ve brought. Please accept it, Master Fu!” Qirongxiu smiled and waved his hand, sending seven vials of Qilin Essence before Fu Tianba.

Qirongxiu’s words fell, and the entire Star Moon Divine City fell silent. People gazed at Qirongxiu with disbelief.

“Truly a clever plan!” Many ancient royal clans showed admiration toward Qirongxiu.

“Coincidentally, the Huntian Clan also came to request a marriage for our unworthy descendant!” A senior of the Huntian Clan smiled, addressing Fu Tianba. He waved his hand, and light flashed.

“Half of the Huntian Ancient Scripture! If this marriage is successful, I’ll also present the other half!” The elder spoke softly, clearly having invested heavily.

“Huntian Ancient Scripture! The ancient scripture of the Huntian Clan’s kings! My heavens, has the Huntian Clan gone mad!” People gasped, gazing at the elder of the Huntian Clan.

“Old Fu, I also came to propose!” Before people could finish their shock, a voice like a rooster’s croak pierced the sky. The old Golden Crow smiled and directly addressed Fu Wenbin.

“I have ten sons here. Which one do you like? The dowry will surely please you!” The old Golden Crow addressed Fu Wenbin.

“I, the Blood Clan, also have this intention. I, the Feng Clan, also came for this reason…” In an instant, these ancient royal clans all began recommending their prodigies. The dowries were naturally precious treasures that even late-era masters would envy.

Stunned, Luo Tian was stunned. Fu Tianba was stunned. Even Fu Wenbin was stunned. Everyone in Star Moon Divine Clan was stunned. They hadn’t expected these royal clans to have such intentions.

Chapter 1333: Can You Beat Him?

“Hah! Since everyone is proposing, I’ll also join the fun!” Sama of the Man Clan smiled and pointed his finger. A long line of runes emerged from his hand, landing on the towering figure of Man Hun, who was prominent.

“Crack…” As if something had broken, a roaring sound echoed from Man Hun’s body. Then, under people's astonished gazes, Man Hun’s massive form shrank down, eventually becoming the size of a normal person.

Although his body was still large, compared to his previous mountain-like form, it had shrunk significantly. People could now fully accept him.

“We Man Clan also wish to discuss this marriage with Star Moon Divine Clan!” Sama of the Man Clan smiled and addressed Fu Wenbin.

“Old man, do you have any shame? Look at this boy’s foolish appearance. How could he be worthy of Star Moon Divine Clan's daughter!” Seeing the Man Clan also joining in, the old Golden Crow was indignant and mocked.

“We Man Clan at least are humanoid. You three-legged birds are still too young to mock me!” The old Sama clearly wasn’t a pushover and retorted directly.

“You’re talking nonsense. We are the Golden Crow Clan…”

“You're the one who's talking nonsense. What if we Man Clan…” The two old men began arguing in front of everyone.

The people around dared not breathe, watching the two exchange insults back and forth.

“These royal clans are really sick!” Luo Tian stood at the front of the crowd, watching the royal clans in the sky with a cold smile.

“Six ancient royal clans all came to propose to us Star Moon Divine Clan?” People were stunned, gazing at the royal clans in the sky with disbelief.

“Where is it a proposal? It's clearly to occupy our Star Moon Divine Clan!” Someone finally understood the situation.

Now that Fu Xingxuan was the Star Moon Divine Emperor, if she married someone, who knew what would happen. Even if it didn’t succeed, it would still tie the two clans together on the same ship.

In history, Star Moon Divine Emperor was always a man. Fu Tianba had married a Feng Clan woman to form an alliance, but this didn’t really affect Star Moon Divine Clan. However, Fu Xingxuan was different. The entire Origin Domain was male-dominated. If Fu Xingxuan couldn’t control her husband in the future, it might lead to unexpected events.

All members of Star Moon Divine Clan immediately glared at the quarreling royal clans in the sky. They hadn’t expected these royal clans to be so scheming.

Fu Wenbin’s face was also grim. He hadn’t expected Fu Xingyue to encounter such a problem right after her coronation. His gaze fell on the old Golden Crow and Sama of the Man Clan.

If it were just one royal clan, it would be manageable. But now all the royal clans had joined in, leaving Fu Wenbin in a difficult position. These clans clearly were pressuring for marriage.

“Fools!” Fu Tianqing stood beside Fu Wenbin, his face grim as he looked at the Qilin Clan members. If it weren’t for their initial actions, this situation wouldn’t have happened.

Fu Tianba stood before Fu Xingxuan, his face fluctuating between anger and calm. He then looked at the three Divine Guardians—Fu Wenbin, Fu Tianqing, and Sama. He knew this matter had gone beyond his control.

“Stop arguing! We just coronated our Divine Emperor, and you’re already pressuring us? Do you really not respect Star Moon Divine Clan?” Fu Wenbin finally couldn’t control himself and scolded, his voice like thunder echoing through Star Moon Divine City.

Fu Wenbin’s anger caused the entire Star Moon Divine City to fall silent. However, it was only a brief silence before people started murmuring again.

“Master Fu, the Huntian Clan truly means well!”

“The Qilin Clan’s prodigy is worthy of Star Moon Divine Emperor!” Each royal clan elder spoke loudly.

“Everyone, the marriage of our Divine Emperor is a top priority for Star Moon Divine Clan. And now that the Divine Emperor is Fu Xingxuan, her marriage must be decided by herself!” Fu Tianba spoke loudly. As a father, he had the right to participate. His gaze fell on Fu Xingxuan.

“Xingxuan, you decide. If you don’t agree, no one can force you!” Fu Tianba spoke smoothly, letting Fu Xingxuan decide for herself. Yet his intention to protect was evident, telling her to simply refuse.

Fu Xingxuan slowly stood up. Her gaze was cold as she scanned the royal clan prodigies. Then, she let out a sneer: “Who among you is the strongest?”

Fu Xingxuan’s words had barely finished when each royal clan prodigy straightened up, their bodies radiating powerful energy as if to say they were the strongest.

“Hah! You all! If you can beat him, I’ll marry him!” Fu Xingxuan looked at each royal clan prodigy with disdain. Then she pointed her finger, indicating Luo Tian standing there calmly.

“Damn…” Luo Tian looked at Fu Xingxuan pointing at him, cursing inwardly. He hadn’t expected this demoness to still have her habit of dragging him into trouble after becoming the Divine Emperor.

“Fu Mengchen? Commander of Star Moon Guards?” People showed confusion, gazing at Luo Tian.

Their eyes scanned over Luo Tian, making him uncomfortable. He felt like a monkey being watched.

“Yes! We have our commander. I’ve heard that Fu Xingxuan was close to our commander when she was a princess. It seems it's true now! Fu Xingxuan is clearly about to publicly acknowledge their relationship!” Star Moon Divine Clan members immediately reacted, gazing at Luo Tian.

Those who had previously admired Fu Xingxuan also showed joy. They knew they couldn’t be with Fu Xingxuan, but compared to letting her marry an outsider, they preferred Luo Tian.

“Yes! Fu Xingxuan is truly smart!” Fu Wenbin smiled, his gaze also on Luo Tian.

“This is my commander. He once picked up dung for the Divine Emperor. If you can’t even beat a dung-picking commander, what qualifications do you have to marry me?” Fu Xingxuan smiled slightly and winked at Luo Tian, barely perceptible.

Though she masked it well, those present—each an expert in observation—recognized Fu Xingxuan’s gesture as being with Luo Tian.

“Damn!” Each royal clan prodigy became furious, their gazes on Luo Tian filled with hostility.

“Commander Fu Mengchen? The Divine Emperor once had him pick up dung?” People smiled, gazing at Luo Tian standing there. Thinking of Luo Tian’s past, they looked at the grim-faced Fu Yunpeng.

“Damn Fu Mengchen!” Fu Yunpeng's face was dark with anger. Seeing the people’s gazes on him, he knew what they were thinking.

“Fu Mengchen, now I order you to fight for me. Are you willing?” Fu Xingxuan addressed Luo Tian, causing him to sigh in frustration.

“This girl is really a pain. I’m about to leave, but she still set me up!” Luo Tian wanted to refuse, but seeing Fu Xingyue’s threatening gaze beside Fu Xingxuan, he finally showed respect.
