“This is a grand formation, drawing vitality. Luosheng Luosheng, encompassing all beings—these people are cultivating through life force!” The Black and White Wu Chang sighed, their hands moving swiftly as divine laws erupted from them, etched into the blood pool.

The blood sea roiled, and the blood within the pool flowed back into the emaciated bodies of those figures.

“How many were killed by Qiu Chan?” Luo Tian closed his eyes, recalling Cold Autumn Cicada’s hands stained with blood.

“Forgive me!”

“No matter if it was Qiu Chan or not,” Luo Tian clenched his fists, and blood gushed from his hands.

The Immortal King’s Blood was formidable, akin to a supreme elixir. Especially Luo Tian’s blood, which instantly fell into the blood pool.

*Buzz…*

A ripple spread; the withered figures in the pool began to revive slowly. Many opened their eyes, vacant and lifeless.

Blood continuously flowed from Luo Tian’s hands, dripping into the pool, absorbed by those within.

“Little one, enough!” The Black and White Wu Chang gazed at Luo Tian, surprised by his actions.

“Luo Brother truly embodies great benevolence!” Jie Du marveled, scattering blood with a wave of his hand, joining Luo Tian in nurturing the pool’s inhabitants with their Immortal King’s Blood.

The thunderous sound never ceased. After half an hour, some in the pool had revived, stepping out with respectful gazes toward Luo Tian and the Black and White Wu Chang.

Luo Tian and Jie Du stood atop the sky, swaying weakly, their faces pale. The Black and White Wu Chang pulled them close.

Though the Black and White Wu Chang treated them, and Luo Tian and Jie Du used their blood to aid, many still failed to rise. Only a few emerged from the pool.

“Enough—everyone return!” The Black and White Wu Chang spoke softly, leading Luo Tian and Jie Du toward the Wheel Turning Palace.

“Little one, you’ve expended your essence,” the Black and White Wu Chang said gravely, sensing Luo Tian’s dire state. They knew he had to face several Holy Sons the next day; in this condition, winning seemed difficult.

“I’m fine,” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. His mind was consumed by finding Cold Autumn Cicada, leaving no room for other thoughts.

In half a day, the three reached the Wheel Turning Palace. Though others were manageable, replenishing essence took more than a day.

“Go to Xingxuan’s place—see if the Bathing Flower can help you recover!” The Black and White Wu Chang delivered Luo Tian to the final level of the Ghost Feeding Pavilion, where Fu Xingxuan resided in the轮回地狱 (Reincarnation Hell).

Chapter 2615: Reengaging the Ten Hall Holy Sons

On a gray bridge, two figures sat cross-legged—Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan. Their palms pressed together, a white beam of light converged at Luo Tian’s head, flowing into his body.

Upon returning, Fu Xingxuan had begun drawing vitality from the Bathing Flower to heal Luo Tian.

After a day of recovery, Luo Tian’s face gradually regained color, but his essence remained unrecovered.

“Enough—further would be wasteful,” Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan both opened their eyes, Luo Tian speaking softly.

“Don’t worry about Qiu Chan—next time I have the chance, I’ll find her,” Fu Xingxuan said, guilt gnawing at her. Had she watched over Cold Autumn Cicada more closely, this wouldn’t have happened.

“Don’t go—she’s in danger now; her surroundings are filled with Luosheng Gate members,” Luo Tian shook his head.

“Don’t mock me—your strength isn’t certain!” Fu Xingxuan pouted, swinging a tiny fist at Luo Tian’s chest.

“I’m genuinely afraid—after finding all of you, I won’t let any harm come to you. I’ll find Qiu Chan no matter what!” Luo Tian replied, his voice soft as he clasped Fu Xingxuan’s hand.

“Okay,” Fu Xingxuan softened, leaning her face against Luo Tian’s chest.

“Enough—watch your husband dominate!” Luo Tian held Fu Xingxuan for a while before his face lit with battle fervor.

“Right,” Fu Xingxuan nodded, and the two soared into the air toward the Reincarnation Hell’s exit.

……

At the Wheel Turning Palace’s arena, a sea of people gathered, filled with its disciples. This was where the Ten Hall Grand Tournament had once been held.

The arena now bore divine laws, no longer a Holy Son’s battleground but the site of an Immortal King’s clash.

Eight figures stood there, their auras piercing the sky, eyes brimming with arrogance—Ten Hall Holy Sons, except Yijianren.

“Why haven’t the hall masters arrived?” Jueying Tianzun furrowed his brow, gazing at the Holy Sons.

“Let them stay—whether they come or not is irrelevant,” a senior stood beside Jueying Tianzun, his gaze cold. Behind him loomed a long sword—none other than Du Jianhang, the Poison Sword Tianzun.

To aid Luo Tian, Du Jianhang had returned from the Immortal Realm, fearing for his safety.

“Du Elder, persuade Luo Tian to return to the Wheel Turning Palace—everything would be resolved,” Jueying Tianzun sighed. Only Du Jianhang could sway Luo Tian.

“Everyone has their own path; I can’t persuade him,” Du Jianhang shook his head, observing the eight Holy Sons.

“One against eight—how do the Holy Sons plan to proceed?” The Wheel Turning Palace disciples murmured, watching the eight—each a prodigy capable of dominating hell alone.

As they whispered, Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan emerged. Holding hands, they appeared like celestial beings; Fu Xingxuan’s beauty was legendary, while Luo Tian radiated vigor.

“Holy Consort!” Fu Xingxuan’s popularity needed no explanation—her appearance instantly drew cheers from the disciples. Truly, she had rarely appeared in years.

“Truly beautiful—just to watch the Holy Consort is enough for me!” Disciples instantly fell into a trance, gazing at Fu Xingxuan’s unveiled face.

“Husband, you should put your veil back on,” Luo Tian smirked, seeing the disciples’ infatuated gazes. A surge of jealousy overtook him.

“Alright,” Fu Xingxuan chuckled, pulling the veil back up—but her laughter only deepened the disciples’ gasps.

“Truly a demon who ruins the nation!” Even the Eight Holy Sons turned their eyes toward Fu Xingxuan.

“Thinking about how the Holy Consort spends nights with the Holy Sons, my heart aches,” people sighed inwardly, watching Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan approach.

“Hey hey, I’m the protagonist!” Luo Tian stepped onto the arena, gazing at Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu, shouting.

“Luo Tian!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the others turned their gazes toward him, eyes cold.

“With your current state, can you beat us?” Cheng Ping of the Equality Hall spoke, disdain evident. They were no ordinary beings; they could clearly see Luo Tian’s injuries.

“Let’s try!” Luo Tian smiled, but his mind was tense—these foes were no pushovers.

“Good, we won’t take advantage! Who’s first?” Wang Xiu’s gaze darkened, addressing the group.

They were Ten Hall Holy Sons—those destined to become hall masters. To attack one with eight was a face they couldn’t bear.

“I’ll go first!” A burly man stepped forward—Fan Tianyin of the Yin Spirit Hall, eyes burning with battle.

“I’ll be casual!” Luo Tian nodded, secretly praising him while relaxing slightly; if they all attacked together, his chances were slim.

As they spoke, the others descended, leaving Luo Tian and Fan Tianyin alone on the arena.

As they stepped down, Fan Tianyin’s aura surged rapidly, his muscles crackling with explosive power.

*Boom boom boom…*

In an instant, Fan Tianyin’s aura pierced the sky—his Yin Spirit Nine Transformations. Yet this time, he was at Immortal King’s中期 (Mid), surpassing his previous prowess. His ninth transformation reached its peak.

*Crack…*

The arena bore deep marks as Fan Tianyin stomped the ground, charging toward Luo Tian.

“Revenge!” Fan Tianyin roared internally, recalling his past defeat to Luo Tian. Now with enhanced strength and confidence, he surged forward.

“You’re still not ready—I actually hope you all attack together; otherwise, there’s no challenge!” Luo Tian smiled, eyes sharp as he rushed toward Fan Tianyin.

In a flash, their fists clashed—each imbalanced yet powerful. All ears heard a thunderous roar.

*Step back… step back…*

Luo Tian and Fan Tianyin both retreated, Luo Tian’s blood qi shaken, his eyes flickering with surprise at Fan Tianyin’s hundred-foot retreat.

“Indeed improved!” Luo Tian smiled, leaping again toward Fan Tianyin, this time infusing a supreme technique.

Chapter 2616: One Against Five

“Earth Demons’ Thirty-Six!” Fan Tianyin bellowed, his fist marked with strange sigils—like a ghost howling. He slammed it toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled, his World-Topper Technique activated instantly as he clashed with Fan Tianyin’s fist. The thunderous clash echoed.

They both retreated, but Luo Tian only took two steps back while Fan Tianyin flew a hundred feet.

“Again!” Fan Tianyin roared, eyes filled with frustration. He stomped the ground, his aura intensifying as he charged Luo Tian.

“Useless!” Luo Tian smiled again, clashing with Fan Tianyin once more.

Fists flew, the arena echoing with thunderous roars. The Wheel Turning Palace disciples were dazzled, unable to track their speed—only the sound of thunder remained.

*Boom boom boom…*

The thunderous roars never ceased, echoing thirty-six times. After the final thunderclap, dust and ghostly mist obscured sight.

“Fearsome!” The Holy Sons gazed in awe, peering through the dust and mist at the arena.

Though the disciples couldn’t see the battle, they saw Fan Tianyin’s Earth Demons’ Thirty-Six failing to subdue Luo Tian, instead being pushed back repeatedly.

*Formation!*

A cold voice echoed through the dust, and a towering figure emerged, piercing through layers of mist.

*Heaven and Earth!*

A thousand-foot figure materialized, Luo Tian gazing at Fan Tianyin, panting and bleeding from his mouth. He stomped forward with a black foot.

“Open!” Fan Tianyin shouted, hands raised to the sky, eyes wild—his past defeat by Luo Tian’s move had made him familiar with “Martial Seven Stomp.”

In an instant, the black foot crushed Fan Tianyin’s body. Fan Tianyin unleashed immense power, his body expanding three times.

Time froze; the black foot pressed onto Fan Tianyin’s hands, both locked in a stalemate.

“Good!” Luo Tian spoke softly, retreating and gazing at Fan Tianyin, his aura disrupted.

Dark qi surged over Luo Tian’s body as a black fist slammed toward Fan Tianyin. The overlapping fists of the Wind-Blade Technique shattered the sky, leaving Fan Tianyin’s face pale.

One… two…

Eight fists—black magic fists with six whirlpools, their power overwhelming. The Six Wheel of Rebirth combined with Wind-Blade could annihilate equals.

In an instant, the thick fist reached Fan Tianyin’s head, violent winds battering his body.

“Tenth Transformation!” Fan Tianyin gritted his teeth, hands moving swiftly to etch divine laws onto his already formidable body.

“Tenth Transformation?” The crowd gasped, even Du Jianhang and other veterans stared in disbelief.

No one had heard of Yin Spirit Nine Transformations having a tenth—was it his own breakthrough?

The crowd roared, watching Fan Tianyin’s aura surge again. Yet his face was pale, divine laws swirling with overwhelming power.

“Go!” Fan Tianyin roared, raising a fist to clash with Luo Tian’s.

The sky trembled, the earth shook; thunderous roars echoed across the land. In an instant, Luo Tian’s black body disintegrated and vanished from sight.

“Fearsome!” All eyes narrowed, staring at the stormy area.

Six whirlpools rose, vanishing into the shattered sky. The arena’s situation revealed itself to the crowd.

Luo Tian stood there, blood trickling from his mouth; Fan Tianyin lay on the ground, one arm severed, surrounded by blood.

“Victory!” The crowd gasped, awe in their eyes as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“I think he didn’t use his full strength,” Wang Xiu spoke, eyes wary. Ye Qiu also gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes glowing with intensity.

“Fearsome—this guy is way stronger than before. We’re truly no match for him!” A youth spoke, the Holy Son of Wu Hua Hall. Though he hadn’t faced Luo Tian in the Ten Hall Grand Tournament, he had observed his battles.

Fan Tianyin trembled as he rose, assisted by others to leave the arena. He gazed at Luo Tian.

“He’s injured too!” Fan Tianyin addressed the crowd before sitting to recover his wounds.

“Why did you leave the Wheel Turning Palace?” The disciples gazed at Luo Tian still standing on the arena. If he hadn’t left, the Wheel Turning Palace would have been stronger.

“So I advise you all to fight together—save us the trouble!” Luo Tian gazed at the Holy Sons, his aura still formidable despite his injuries.

The Holy Sons fell silent, eyes burning with anger. Finally, five figures soared into the air, landing on the arena—excluding Wang Xiu and Ye Qiu.

“Admit it—you can’t beat a single Holy Son!” The disciples murmured, watching Luo Tian. To have the Ten Hall Holy Sons admit defeat was unprecedented, even for Ye Qiu.

“Five?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly as he gazed at the five surrounding him.

“Equality Hall Cheng Ping,苦神殿 (Suffering Spirit Hall) Tian Baiguang, Wu Hua Hall Yin Wu,太平殿 (Peaceful Heaven Hall) Li Yuanqing, and Five Palace Wu Xingwen!” Luo Tian recited the names of the five Holy Sons in his mind.

“Won’t you two fight together?” Luo Tian gazed at Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu, considering them the strongest.

“I want a one-on-one!” Ye Qiu held his sword, Jueyun, speaking softly. He didn’t wish to overwhelm with numbers.

“I don’t have confidence,”

“This time, it won’t be like before!” Wang Xiu smiled. The last tournament, Luo Tian had threatened his life to force a fight—only a few exchanges occurred.

“Hope you can handle these five!” Ye Qiu’s eyes gleamed with battle fervor, gazing at Luo Tian.

“As you wish!” Luo Tian nodded, his mind more solemn now. He raised his hand, and the Cracking Heaven Spear materialized in his grip, gazing at the five.

“Begin!” Luo Tian spoke, stomping the ground and rushing toward Cheng Ping of the Equality Hall.

*Buzz…* Cheng Ping’s face shifted slightly, his black spear raised overhead.

Chapter 2617: Lifting the Spear

The black spear cleaved through the sky, crashing down toward Cheng Ping. Cheng Ping raised his spear to block—his hands trembled, his body bending downward.

One strike alone had made Cheng Ping spit blood. Yet it wasn’t over; Luo Tian gripped the Cracking Heaven Spear with one hand, pressing it against Cheng Ping’s spear. He remained in this position, and no matter how hard Cheng Ping pushed, he couldn’t dislodge Luo Tian’s attack.

“Kill!” As Luo Tian attacked Cheng Ping, the other four also launched their assaults.

Yin Wu’s hands moved swiftly, summoning a black tortoise that charged toward Luo Tian.

Li Yuanqing of the Peaceful Heaven Hall waved his hand, sending three glimmers toward Luo Tian. Speed was unmatched—three cold blades approached him instantly.

On the other side, Wu Xingwen raised his hand, summoning a black sigil dragon to coil around Luo Tian.

Tian Baiguang struck with a divine light, faster than Li Yuanqing’s three blades.

Faced with four attacks, Luo Tian remained calm. In a flash, he shifted his blood knife to the other hand and slashed.

The crimson blade’s aura surged with a humming sound, clashing with the divine light and shattering it. Two blades were also destroyed before the aura fully collapsed.

Luo Tian retracted his blade, raised his hand to grasp a black knife an inch from his palm. The blade glowed with cold light.

But Wu Xingwen and Yin Wu’s attacks were too fast for Luo Tian to evade—only a direct block was possible.

*Boom…*

The tortoise’s massive foot crushed Luo Tian and Cheng Ping, shaking his body downward.

Yet Cheng Ping fared worse—his spear slipped from his grip, and he was crushed to the ground.

Dust swirled; black sigils infiltrated the dust, wrapping around Luo Tian and sealing his cultivation.

Though it seemed slow, it happened in an instant. When the disciples reacted, dust had already engulfed Luo Tian and Cheng Ping.

Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu stared intently at the arena—Luo Tian alone against five Ten Hall Holy Sons. If he won, it would be terrifying.

“He’s still too arrogant; though the first two attacks were blocked, he was hit by one—most fatal. Five Palace’s Five Seal!” Wang Xiu spoke, gazing at Luo Tian wrapped in black sigils.

“This kid’s battle experience is too rich—he knows which threats are most dangerous!” Du Jianhang smiled, watching Luo Tian without worry.

In the dust, Luo Tian held the Cracking Heaven Spear against Cheng Ping’s body, making him curse.

“Why me!” Cheng Ping was utterly exasperated; he had skills, but now he was pinned by Luo Tian. He felt Luo Tian must have taken the wrong medicine, targeting him from the start.

“He’s right—this five is strongest,”

“But even if he subdued Cheng Ping, his movement was restricted. How will he handle it?” Ye Qiu sighed, his battle fervor deepening.

“Kill!” Seeing Luo Tian wrapped in sigils, Yin Wu and others launched another assault. Four attacks shattered the sky—each radiating formidable power.

What surprised Luo Tian was that he felt intense killing intent within the four techniques.

“Someone wants to eliminate me?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly; with four attacks disrupting space, he couldn’t determine who held the killing intent.

“Then I’ll kill them all—let you reincarnate!” Luo Tian muttered, lifting the spear to crush Cheng Ping.

This lift made Cheng Ping’s eyes light up with joy—without hesitation, he slammed his hands to the ground and rolled backward.

But Luo Tian was now wrapped in Wu Xingwen’s sigils, feeling dizzy and disoriented. His senses vanished.

*Boom boom boom…*

As Luo Tian was dizzy, the four techniques struck him directly, sending him flying and spitting blood. He fell from the sky to the ground, his body riddled with cracks.

“This is it? You boasted about fighting eight!” Wu Xingwen smiled, but the Wheel Turning Palace disciples snorted.

“Five against one—victorious, yet still arrogant!” The disciples muttered; Luo Tian was a Holy Son of the Wheel Turning Palace, though he had joined the Tianyuan Sect, it wasn’t stated he left.

“I’m here!” Cheng Ping roared, eyes excited, his spear swirling like a hawk capturing prey.

As Cheng Ping shouted, Luo Tian rose in an odd posture, his body radiating waves of qi. His strong blood began to break the sigils.

“Trying to escape my Five Seal? That’s too easy!” Wu Xingwen sneered, hands moving to summon a black seal toward Luo Tian.

The others also attacked, gathering powerful blows toward Luo Tian.

*Crack crack crack…*

But as Wu Xingwen’s words ended, the sigils around Luo Tian began to break. Five sigils instantly collapsed before his eyes.

“*Buzz…*” Luo Tian swung the Cracking Heaven Spear upward, clashing with Cheng Ping’s attack above his head.

Multiple spear images merged instantly, sweeping over Cheng Ping’s spear. Cheng Ping immediately felt his hands numb, his palm cracked, and his spear flew from his grip.

Luo Tian swept Cheng Ping’s spear away; the other four attacks also arrived. Luo Tian remained calm, his back suddenly surging with a wave—two wings, black and white, unfolded. The wings trembled, causing chaos in space, a storm rising to meet the four attacks.

*Boom boom boom…*

The sky shattered, winds swept, and ghostly mist poured from the massive arena.

“Damn!” Cheng Ping’s face darkened; he suddenly turned, grabbing for his spear that had flown.

But as Cheng Ping flew a short distance, a figure suddenly appeared near him, making his scalp tingle. He saw the glint of cold light and gasped in disbelief at the black spear, exclaiming.

Chapter 2618: Piercing Through Void

“Impossible!” Cheng Ping gasped, eyes wide with disbelief. Then he felt his shoulder cool and his feet go numb—cold air surged into his body.

“*What?*” Ye Qiu, Wang Xiu, and Du Jianhang gazed in shock. They could clearly see Luo Tian’s spear was unavoidable.

Steady, precise, ruthless—three words embodied Luo Tian’s mastery. A simple spear thrust had wounded Cheng Ping severely.

Cheng Ping’s body hung on the Cracking Heaven Spear, blood spattering onto the ground.

“You should be grateful I didn’t have killing intent!” Luo Tian raised his hand, flinging Cheng Ping’s body off the arena.

“One down!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gripping his spear and gazing at Yin Wu and the others. His eyes narrowed, seeking any flaw in their movements.

“Fearsome—one against five, killing one, and still fighting!” The Wheel Turning Palace disciples roared in chaos, gazing at Luo Tian with reverence.

“Holy Son—he’s not human! I’ve always known it—he fights well and even seduces women, managing to win over the Holy Consort and the Demon King!” A disciple shouted, his voice filled with fervor.

“How did he do that?” Ye Qiu gazed in confusion at Luo Tian, who held the spear against the four.

“What was that move called?” Cheng Ping stood up without returning to the arena, his face pale as he asked Luo Tian.

Cheng Ping was a spear master, but he couldn’t decipher Luo Tian’s move. He had believed his spear art was at its peak.

In the Immortal Realm and Hell, few used spears—most preferred swords or blades. Thus, Cheng Ping was proud of his spear art.

But Luo Tian’s move shattered his beliefs; he felt Luo Tian’s spear mastery surpassed him, and that move was impossible for him to replicate.

“Piercing Through Void!” Luo Tian replied softly. He hadn’t sensed killing intent on Cheng Ping, so he held back, merely incapacitating him temporarily.

“Piercing Through Void! A fine name!” Cheng Ping’s eyes flickered with contemplation.

“You have four more chances to see it!” Luo Tian addressed Cheng Ping, rare in encountering a spear master. Though Cheng Ping hadn’t resisted before being knocked down, Luo Tian knew his skills were no small feat.

Thus, a sense of mutual respect arose in Luo Tian’s heart. As he spoke, he moved—his feet formed a vortex, and his wings trembled.

The Yellow River Step combined with the Fallen Heaven Wings achieved极致 (extreme) speed, and in an instant, he reached the four.

“Damn!” Yin Wu roared, hands moving swiftly to conjure a tortoise shell before him, blocking Luo Tian’s attack.

*Buzz…*

But Yin Wu underestimated Luo Tian’s strike; the black spear tip pierced through the shell, precisely striking Yin Wu’s throat.

“*Ugh… ugh…*” Yin Wu spat blood, his eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“One…” Luo Tian muttered softly, then turned abruptly, his hand forming a seal. Above the black sky, a vortex appeared, and a Hellish Ghost Claw descended from it, colliding with Wu Xingwen’s attack.

*Boom…*

The ghost claw shattered, the sky trembled. Luo Tian’s body was also sent flying again, blood spewing from his mouth—but he still stood.

“Again!” He stomped the ground, wings vibrating again, vanishing from sight.

*Plop…*

Another unstoppable spear—this time it was Wu Xingwen, his throat pierced and falling to the arena.

The entire Wheel Turning Palace fell silent, gazing at Luo Tian standing there, who had been struck again. Their eyes held intense awe.

Two spears, two Holy Sons—too terrifying. The powerful Holy Sons were like chicks under Luo Tian’s might, even faster than killing chickens.

“This is his true strength!” Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu’s eyes also showed disbelief; Luo Tian’s might exceeded their comprehension.

Luo Tian stood up, wiping his mouth’s blood. Dark qi surged from his body, mending his wounds.

*Buzz…*

The Fallen Heaven Wings trembled; Luo Tian’s figure vanished again, and the familiar sound of a throat-piercing spear echoed. This time it was Li Yuanqing, who slowly fell.

“Not painful anymore!” Luo Tian’s face was pale; though he had killed three Holy Sons with his spears, he too had been struck by their techniques and was severely wounded.

“One left!” Luo Tian gazed at Tian Baiguang, who had previously struck him with a divine light on his lower back, leaving a wound visible to the white bone.

*Plop…* Blood splattered; Tian Baiguang’s body fell, four corpses lying on the arena—unusually tragic.

*Cough cough…*

Luo Tian spat blood, his body swaying. He leaned on the bloodstained Cracking Heaven Spear, gazing at Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu.

“Come fight!” Luo Tian panted, raising his hand to grasp four divine souls in his palm.

“Again this move!” Seeing Luo Tian pulling out the four Holy Sons’ souls, people trembled.

“No matter who wants to kill me, this is the first time—should there be a next, it won’t be so easy!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, gazing at the four souls.

“After being killed, they’re only left with souls—still not easy? What would it be if it were easy?” People’s mouths twitched.

“Someone wants to kill Luo Tian?” But Du Jianhang and others understood the implication in Luo Tian’s words. The ‘kill’ here wasn’t like Luo Tian’s—it meant complete annihilation.

Luo Tian waved his hand, sending the four souls to Du Jianhang. Four souls with terrified faces drifted toward him.

*Buzz…* But as the four souls approached Du Jianhang, a wave arose from among the Wheel Turning Palace disciples. A dark light shot toward the four souls at incredible speed.

“Someone wants to kill them!” Luo Tian’s face changed, and Du Jianhang’s expression darkened.

The light was too fast; Luo Tian was injured, and no one had expected someone to annihilate the four.

“This is the Soul-Seeking Crossbow! It kills souls—big trouble!” Ye Qiu gasped, stomping the ground. The crowd roared; the one who shot the arrow was nowhere to be found, and the four souls’ eyes showed terror. A strong sense of life-or-death crisis gripped them.

Chapter 2619: Can He Fight Again?

A decisive strike—no one could withstand it. No one reacted in time. The first to react was Luo Tian, as he was closest to the four.

“They can’t die!” In an instant, Luo Tian stomped the ground, a drop of essence blood burning. His entire cultivation poured into the Cracking Heaven Spear, which he hurled toward the four souls.

In this life-or-death moment, Luo Tian’s action was instinctive—throwing the spear and praying.

Black light flashed; the Cracking Heaven Spear, thrown with all his might, appeared before the four souls.

“Must block it!” Luo Tian roared, clenching his fists tightly, eyes tense. This tension hadn’t been felt by Luo Tian in a long time.

If the four died, it would provoke the wrath of their halls. Not only would the Wheel Turning Palace be involved, but Tianyuan Sect would also face destruction due to their anger.

Although Wang Duantian was strong enough to suppress one hall, five halls united would overwhelm him.

*Clink clink…*

Thankfully, two clear sounds made Luo Tian exhale deeply, sweat pouring from his forehead.

The black Cracking Heaven Spear collided with two crossbows, crashing into the four souls’ bodies. A large amount of soul power spilled from them.

“Come here!” Luo Tian sat on the ground, raising his hand to grasp the four souls. Though their soul power was damaged, they were still alive.

“Thank goodness!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly; these four had luck on their side. If he hadn’t desperately thrown the spear, they would have been annihilated by the crossbow. He himself had no confidence in blocking it—just a gamble, a desperate move. Their lives were sheer luck.

Du Jianhang and Ye Qiu rushed onto the arena, surrounding Luo Tian as they gazed at the chaotic Wheel Turning Palace disciples.

“Seal the mountain—no disciple of the Wheel Turning Palace may leave!” Jueying Tianzun barked, golden light rising from all directions, enclosing the Wheel Turning Palace.

“Thank you, Luo Brother!” Wu Xingwen’s gray soul spoke to Luo Tian, his eyes filled with gratitude.

They knew if they died, the Wheel Turning Palace and Tianyuan Sect would suffer. But who wanted to die? If not for Luo Tian, they’d already be dead. They also knew the one who wanted to kill them wasn’t from the Wheel Turning Palace.

Wang Xiu held two black crossbows, his brow furrowed: “Soul-Seeking Arrows are secret weapons of the Revenant Sect. If they died, our Revenant Sect would also face trouble.”

The two black crossbows seemed unremarkable, but if a soul touched them, it would be torn apart instantly—no chance of survival.

“Enough, four souls. This matter will be addressed by the Wheel Turning Palace to your hall masters,” Du Jianhang spoke to the four souls, who nodded hurriedly. At that moment, they only wished to recover quickly.
