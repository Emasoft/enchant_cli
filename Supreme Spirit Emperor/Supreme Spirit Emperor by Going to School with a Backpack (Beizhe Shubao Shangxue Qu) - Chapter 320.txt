“Your Majesty’s temper you know well enough. He indulges you in minor matters, but this is a major issue—you cannot change it!” Fu Xingyue pulled Fu Xingxuan back.

“You’re right, but complaining about injustice is useless. You must find a way to solve it!” Fu Xingyue’s face bore a determined expression.

“Not simple at all,” Luotian mused, sensing Fu Tianba’s depth. A single sentence had made Fu Xingyue compliant and unlocked his potential.

“Second Prince, how many of our forces have over a million merit points?” Luotian asked directly.

“Uh…” Fu Xingyue’s confidence wavered at Luotian’s words, his shoulders drooping.

“Two…” Fu Xingyue raised two fingers, gazing at Luotian.

“Damn! How the hell is this played!” Luotian cursed under his breath, realizing they had only two people.

“Fine—who are the others? Fu Zhiming must have reached a million merit points, plus you and me. That’s four. Who’s the fifth?” Luotian rubbed his temples, sipping tea.

“I said… just me, you, and Fu Zhiming…” Fu Xingyue grimaced, his gaze awkwardly avoiding Luotian.

“Pfft…” Luotian couldn’t hold back, spitting tea across the room. Fu Xingxuan, standing beside him, was caught off guard and drenched in tea.

“Uh…” Luotian blinked, Fu Xingyue’s eyes widening in shock.

“Fu… Meng… Chen…” Fu Xingxuan hissed, her face pale as she clutched her chest. Her thin attire had been instantly dried by her own energy, but she was certain Luotian had seen.

The thought of his saliva in the tea made her stomach churn.

“Sister, I didn’t mean to!” Luotian panicked. He *had* seen it, but he hadn’t wanted to. The thought of Fu Xingxuan’s wrath terrified him.

“Wait for me! I’ll rip out your eyes!” Fu Xingxuan vanished, her intent to punish Luotian clear. Yet she felt an unease in her chest and longed to return for a bath and fresh clothes.

“Mengchen…” Fu Xingxuan sighed, pity in her eyes as she looked at Luotian.

“This damned thing…” Luotian felt like crying, imagining Fu Xingxuan’s cruel plans. A chill ran through him at the thought of her vengeance.

He glared at Fu Xingyue: “Second Prince, are you mocking me? We’re only two people—how can we succeed?”

“Indeed difficult,” Fu Xingyue admitted, bitterness in his voice. “My eldest brother has four Early Epoch masters, my third brother three more. That’s not counting them!”

“Two of us against nearly ten Early Epoch masters and over a dozen near-Early Epoch…” Luotian sighed, his headache worsening.

Though he boasted of unmatched combat power, even facing a few Early Epoch masters left him uncertain. And there was Fu Xingyang, a prodigy with thick royal blood.

“Alas…” Fu Xingyue sighed, unsure of his next move.

“Second Prince, don’t hide it from me. Your eldest and third brothers have countless Early Epoch masters—surely you’ve got your own ace!”

“Of course, if not, there’s no point in competing,” Luotian sighed.

“I *can* summon Early Epoch masters, but it’s useless—our merit points are insufficient!” Fu Xingyue sighed, his face grim.

“Think of a way. Let’s go to the Merit Hall and take all tasks—we’ll gain enough points!” Luotian sighed, resigned to the only option.

“Indeed, there’s no alternative,” Fu Xingyue nodded, and the two set off for the Merit Hall.

Under the people’s reverent gazes, Luotian and Fu Xingyue entered the Merit Hall. Yet as they stepped inside, an unease prickled their senses.

The hall was usually bustling, but today it felt thrice as crowded.

“What’s going on?” They entered and found the Merit Hall teeming with people, like a chaotic market.

“Second Prince, you’ve come to take tasks too?” Fu Xingyang emerged from the crowd, spotting them. He smiled.

“Ah, Elder Brother, your forces are so numerous—why compete with me for these merit points?” Fu Xingyue felt a bad premonition but smiled.

“Can’t help it, Second Prince. I fear an oversight,” Fu Xingyang glanced at Luotian, his eyes sharp.

“I’ll take my leave then,” Fu Xingyang said softly, leading his men out.

“Boom!” As Fu Xingyang left, the crowd instantly followed half of his group.

Fu Xingyang and Luotian approached a counter, addressing the attendant: “Bring me the task list!”

“Yes, Second Prince,” the attendant recognized Fu Xingyue and handed over the task list.

“Ah… I’ll take all…” Fu Xingyue began, but his face darkened. The Merit Hall froze.

“Smack!” Fu Xingyue hurled the task list to the ground, cursing: “Damn! All tasks are taken!”

“Indeed,” Luotian sighed. Seeing Fu Xingyang’s arrival, he’d known the tasks wouldn’t be easy.

He said nothing. If he were Fu Xingyang, he’d have left no chance for Fu Xingyue.

“What now?” Fu Xingyue’s face was stormy.

“How long until Thunder Roar Palace opens?” Luotian and Fu Xingyue left the Merit Hall, his lips curling.

“Depends on Fu Xingchen’s injuries,” Fu Xingyue sighed.

“Then we’ll have to inconvenience Third Prince!” Luotian’s lips curled into a smirk, clenching his fists.

Chapter 1311: Prolonging Injuries

“What do you mean?” Fu Xingyue’s voice was icy.

“Think of a way!” Luotian rubbed his chin, gazing toward the Star Pavilion—where Fu Xingchen resided.

“Since the Emperor gave you this trial, he clearly expects you to use special methods!” Luotian marveled at Fu Tianba’s depth, speaking to Fu Xingyue.

Though this situation seemed to corner Fu Xingyue, it was a test for all three sons. Luotian had spent enough time in Star Moon City to know their personalities.

Eldest Prince Fu Xingyang was ruthless and calculating; Second Prince Fu Xingyue lacked his brother’s ferocity; Third Prince Fu Xingchen was underpowered and inexperienced.

Luotian had no doubt Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen had already known the news, likely told by Fu Tianba to test their responses.

This was Fu Tianba’s trial—beginning the moment he informed Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen.

Indeed, they had acted decisively, leaving no room for Fu Xingyue.

This was the test: Fu Xingyue must accumulate enough merit points to enter Thunder Roar Palace.

The best strategy was prolonging Fu Xingchen’s injuries, testing whether he’d strike his brother.

Luotian explained this to Fu Xingyue, who paled at the depth of his father’s calculation.

“Even without my telling you, in a few days, you’d have struck Fu Xingchen to delay his recovery,” Luotian said.

“Second Prince, your decision—whether to act or not,” Luotian murmured, waiting.

Fu Xingyue’s eyes narrowed, gazing toward the Star Pavilion. After a moment, he nodded.

“My Third Prince’s injuries are manageable—he’s near-Early Epoch. Either of us could injure him. But the merit points problem remains! Even with two more months, we can’t gather enough!” Fu Xingyue sighed.

“Leave the merit points to me,” Luotian smiled confidently.

“Fine,” Fu Xingyue nodded, trusting his confidence.

“Also, Second Prince—don’t sneak into the Star Pavilion. Do it openly!” Luotian smiled again.

“Why?” Fu Xingyue frowned, puzzled. He felt his Second Prince was becoming inscrutable, even confusing him.

“If I’m right, this is what the Emperor wants—indirectly testing Third Prince!” Luotian sighed.

“Indeed, Elder Third is too overconfident,” Fu Xingyue nodded, and the two reached Star Moon Pavilion.

“Fu Zhiming, fetch Third Prince—tell him I need to discuss entering Thunder Roar Palace!” Fu Xingchen ordered upon arriving.

“Yes,” Fu Zhiming hesitated, aware of the tense relations between the three princes.

“Thunder Roar Palace!” Fu Zhiming’s face paled at the name.

“Yes, it’s opening early! Go!” Fu Xingyue saw Fu Zhiming’s confusion and urged him.

“Yes,” Fu Zhiming, though unaware of the purpose, planned to rush to the Merit Hall.

As Fu Zhiming left, Fu Xingyue asked Luotian: “How will you gather merit points?”

“Besides tasks, there are other ways—like elixirs!” Luotian answered.

“Elixirs?” Fu Xingyue’s eyes lit up, then dimmed.

“Elixirs are useful, but a Holy-grade初级 elixir grants only ten thousand points. A Holy-grade中级 gives one hundred thousand. Where would I find a Holy-grade中级 alchemist?”

“My grandfather is a Holy-grade中级 alchemist, but he’d never help me!” Fu Xingyue sighed.

“Second Prince, didn’t you forget we have a Holy-grade中级 alchemist in Star Moon Guard?” Luotian smiled.

“Xiao Ding!” Fu Xingyue recognized the name, murmuring: “But Xiao Ding left, and you can’t contact him!”

“Find him! Give me a month, and I’ll bring Xiao Ding back!” Luotian vowed.

“Fine—there’s no other choice,” Fu Xingyue sighed, nodding.

As they spoke, two Star Moon Guards entered, their faces grim. They bowed: “Second Prince, a crisis—deputy commander was attacked and injured!”

“Huh?” Fu Xingyue and Luotian exchanged glances, rising.

As they exited the hall, two Star Moon Guards carried Fu Zhiming, bloodied and wounded. His injuries were severe, wounds glowing with pale light, slowing healing. Luotian sensed a lingering Epoch energy within him—this injury would take days to recover.

“I don’t know… I relayed your words, and Third Prince ordered a master to attack me. I couldn’t fight back!” Fu Zhiming’s face was pale, his voice bitter.

Fu Xingyue and Luotian exchanged glances, guessing Fu Xingchen’s motive. Fu Xingyue murmured: “If you’re so ruthless, don’t blame me!”

“Excellent! Deputy commander, your loyalty is rewarded!” Luotian smiled, placing an elixir in Fu Zhiming’s mouth and injecting Epoch energy.

Fu Zhiming was stunned, as were the Star Moon Guards—why would their commander be praised for being injured?

“Gather a hundred Star Moon Guards—we’ll confront them!” Fu Xingyue ordered, his face cold.

He took out his identity token, imprinting his voice into it.

“Buzz…” As Fu Xingyue’s voice echoed, three elders emerged from the Star Pavilion within minutes.

“Respectful greetings, Second Prince!” The three elders bowed respectfully.

Luotian noted their Epoch-level energy and recognized them as the three spectators from Star Moon’s Grand Tournament.

“Let’s go!” Fu Xingyue nodded coldly, leading the three elders and a hundred Star Moon Guards toward the Star Pavilion.

“What’s happening?” The city’s people wondered, watching Fu Xingyue and Luotian with five Epoch-level figures.

“Second Prince is heading to the Star Pavilion?”

“Haven’t you heard? The deputy commander was severely injured by Third Prince! Second Prince is avenging him!” People marveled, watching the powerful group.

“Such a fuss over one deputy commander—Second Prince is truly loyal!” They murmured, respect in their voices.

The hundred Star Moon Guards were elated, gazing at Fu Xingyue. They’d never felt such devotion since returning from the Beast Continent.

The group marched swiftly, reaching the Star Pavilion in minutes. Fu Xingyue’s eyes glowed coldly as he slammed his hand against the gate.

“Boom!” The seemingly indestructible door crumbled, dust swirling.

“Who dares disturb our Star Pavilion?” Two Star Guards emerged from the smoke, their voices sharp with killing intent.

“It’s me!” Fu Xingyue smiled, snatching the two Super-Grade Star Guards and throwing them to the ground.

They spat blood, fear in their eyes—never expecting Second Prince to attack.

“Move!” Fu Xingyue strode into the Star Pavilion, shouting: “Fu Xingchen, come out!”

Chapter 1312: Attacking Fu Xingchen

“Boom!” The palace collapsed under Fu Xingyue’s strike, shaking the entire Star Pavilion.

“Fu Xingyue, what do you mean?” Fu Xingchen emerged from the crowd, his face pale.

“Mean? My deputy commander was injured here! What do *you* mean?” Fu Xingyue turned, gazing at Fu Xingchen.

“Still injured?” Luotian saw Fu Xingchen, surprised—his injuries were still severe. He’d expected Fu Xingchen to heal in days.

“Something’s off!” Luotian sensed a violet glow, observing Fu Xingchen. His face darkened.

“He’s about to breakthrough!” Luotian realized, sensing Fu Xingchen’s cultivation was nearly complete.

“Seems I need to prolong it longer,” Luotian mused, transmitting to Fu Xingyue.

“Second Prince, Third Prince faked his injuries—he’s waiting to breakthrough!” Luotian’s voice echoed in Fu Xingyue’s mind.

“Why?” Fu Xingchen shrugged, indifferent. “A servant—do you really need to do this?”

“Need!” Fu Xingyue闪身, striking Fu Xingchen. “Fu Zhiming served me decades—had he been injured by you, I’d lose all authority in Star Moon Guard!”

“Smack!” Fu Xingyue’s palm struck Fu Xingchen, sending him flying. The impact collapsed buildings, leaving Fu Xingchen dazed.

“Cough… cough…” Fu Xingchen spat blood, his head split by the blow.

“Third Prince!” His guards surged forward, eyes on Fu Xingchen.

“Buzz…” The three elders Fu Xingchen summoned froze, their bodies halted by Fu Xingyue’s aura.

“Brother punishing brother—have you never seen it?” Fu Xingyue coldly addressed them, his aura pressing.

“Th… this…” The three elders stiffened, exchanging glances before bowing.

Fu Xingyue’s meaning was clear: this was their family matter, not for them to interfere.

Meanwhile, the three elders accompanying Luotian and Fu Xingyue stood before them, their auras pinning the three.

The elders had no choice—without numbers or quality, they couldn’t match Luotian’s group. Even one of them could overpower two.

“Boom!” Fu Xingyue reappeared before Fu Xingchen, striking him relentlessly.

“Ah… Fu Xingyue, are you trying to kill me?” Fu Xingchen cried out, his voice agonized.

“I’m teaching you—treat subordinates kindly!” Fu Xingyue declared, assuming the role of a stern elder.

Everyone was stunned by Fu Xingchen’s plight, their mouths twitching—yet it was natural for an elder to discipline a younger.

As Fu Xingyue punished Fu Xingchen, Fu Xingyang received news, his eyes darkening.

“Fool! Now he’s offended Fu Xingyue—this is his own death. Second Prince would welcome this delay in Thunder Roar Palace entry. Third Prince truly lacks sense, giving Second Prince a reason!” Fu Xingyang’s eyes were cold.

“Faster than expected,” Fu Tianba smiled, listening to his subordinates.

He held a jade slip, his eyes deep. This was the report on Star Moon Guard’s commander.

“Knew each other in the Beast Continent? Continue investigating—no blanks. I want his lineage, even three generations before meeting Star Moon!” Fu Tianba ordered into the void.

“Yes,” a low voice echoed, vanishing from Fu Tianba’s perception.

“Who are you? Why approach Star Moon?” Fu Tianba crushed the jade slip, murmuring.

“Ah… ah…” Fu Xingyue’s cries echoed as he struck Fu Xingchen, leaving the crowd speechless.

Fu Xingchen was bloodied, his body riddled with cracks. The Star Pavilion’s half collapsed into ruins.

“This isn’t punishment—it’s murder!” Fu Xingchen’s three elders nearly attacked, but Luotian’s group held them back.

“Let my deputy lie for a month—I’ll let you lie for three!” Fu Xingyue coldly said, clapping his hands.

Fu Xingyue felt it was enough; he knew Fu Xingchen’s injuries would take three months, even with Holy-grade elixirs. This was their plan.

“Let’s go!” Fu Xingyue approached Luotian, leading the hundred Star Moon Guards away.

“Ugh…” Fu Xingchen lay motionless, groaning, his body wracked by a terrifying force tearing his meridians. He couldn’t even speak.

“Third Prince!” The three elders rushed to his side, beginning treatment.

“Second Prince, you were too harsh!” The hundred Star Moon Guards returned, their spirits high as they gazed at Fu Xingyue.

“Victory!” People watched the triumphant Star Moon Guards, curious about Fu Xingyue and Luotian.

“Did you hear the thunderous sounds from Star Pavilion? And those cries—didn’t they sound like Third Prince?” People murmured, gazing at Star Pavilion.

“Did he attack Third Prince?” Their eyes widened in disbelief, watching Fu Xingyue. They rushed to Star Pavilion for news.

Fu Xingyue and his group returned to Star Moon Pavilion, the hundred guards and three elders departing. Fu Xingyue smiled at Luotian: “I’ve bought you time—now it’s your turn!”

“Rest assured! I’ll find Xiao Ding within a month,” Luotian bowed, leaving.

Luotian returned to his quarters but froze—intending to gather things, he vanished instantly.

“Crash!” Porcelain shattered on the floor, echoing.

Servants stood respectfully, watching the figure smashing things. They didn’t know why their mistress had come to destroy the commander’s mansion.

“Fu Mengchen, you bastard—don’t let me see you!” Fu Xingxuan shouted, gazing at Luotian’s direction. She felt movement and guessed who it was—her face darkened, destroying the mansion.

“Too terrifying! Too dangerous! I’m lucky I reacted quickly—otherwise, I’d have lost my skin!” Luotian fled Star Moon City, wiping sweat from his face.

He planned to wander outside the city for days before returning as Xiao Ding.

During his absence, Star Moon City buzzed with news: Second Prince Fu Xingyue had led forces into Star Pavilion, beating Third Prince.

This was the first time three princes fought openly—Fu Xingchen would be incapacitated for a while.

A strange atmosphere arose in Star Moon City, many realizing the princes might now compete fiercely.

Another rumor spread: Thunder Roar Palace would open early, though the exact time was unknown.

The city’s people were drawn to Thunder Roar Palace, rushing to the Merit Hall for tasks—but found none.

“Who took all the tasks?” This action enraged people, who quickly discovered it was Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen. Their status plummeted in the city’s eyes.

“Mengchen, our plan is proceeding smoothly—now it’s your turn!” Fu Xingyue smiled, listening to reports on Star Moon City.

Chapter 1313: Xiao Ding’s Return

Time passed, and Star Moon City felt a subtle undercurrent. A tense atmosphere lingered—though people were helpless, they dared not confront Fu Xingyang to abandon the tasks.

Star Moon Guards noticed a problem: their commander had vanished again. Fu Xingxuan visited multiple times, destroying the mansion each time before leaving angrily.

All of Fu Xingxuan’s admirers scoured the city for Luotian, though they didn’t know why he’d offended her. Seeing her anger, they too went mad—though cautious of his status, their combined influence made them fearless.

Under Fu Xingyue’s anticipation, Luotian finally returned as Xiao Ding from Star Moon City.

As he entered, he was spotted by the frenzied admirers, their gazes turning hostile.

“You finally returned!” A nobleman smiled.

“It’s him—Xiao Ding! I didn’t think he’d dare return!” The admirers surrounded Luotian, excitement in their eyes.

“Even if we didn’t find the commander, catching this kid and taking him to the princess would be a great achievement!” The noblemen chattered, surrounding Luotian tightly.

“Those damned flies!” Luotian sighed helplessly, cursing his luck.

“Sorry, everyone—please make way. I need to see Second Prince!” Luotian said, invoking Fu Xingyue’s name.

“Just a lowly Star Moon Guard—how dare you invoke Second Prince? Seize him!” Someone shouted, rushing forward.

“Go to hell!” Luotian kicked a youth near him, sending him flying. He leapt into the air, streaking toward Star Moon Pavilion.

“Chase! How dare he attack us? He’s just a lowly Star Moon Guard—acting like the commander!” The crowd roared, chasing him.

Thousands followed Luotian toward Star Moon Pavilion—spectacular.

“Star Moon City is lively these days,” people murmured, watching the noblemen chase Luotian.

Luotian cursed his luck—his speed could leave them far behind, but he couldn’t. He was now Xiao Ding, not the commander Fu Mengchen.

“Damn! Three near-Early Epoch masters!” He noticed three figures chasing him, cursing.

Xiao Ding’s displayed strength was Holy-grade late-stage—no match for near-Early Epoch masters.

“Hmph, Xiao Ding’s speed is decent,” the three near-Early Epoch youths glanced at each other, smiling.

Though fast, Luotian kept a distance, appearing at Star Moon Pavilion’s gates.

“Second Prince, Star Moon Guard Xiao Ding requests an audience!” Luotian bellowed, flashing his Star Moon token.

“Damn!” The three near-Early Epoch youths grimaced, watching Luotian enter Star Moon Pavilion. They dared not follow.

“Xiao Ding!” Fu Xingyue’s face lit up, surprised Xiao Ding had returned so quickly. He vanished from the hall, appearing before Luotian.

“Xiao Ding!” Fu Xingyue smiled, grabbing Luotian and entering the hall.

“Respectful greetings, Second Prince!” Luotian started to bow but was stopped by Fu Xingyue.

“Where’s Mengchen? He found you so quickly?” Fu Xingyue asked.

“No,” Luotian feigned ignorance, puzzled.

“Ah, it’s good you’re back. I have a task for you—but it may be difficult,” Fu Xingyue smiled, assuming Luotian had returned without finding Xiao Ding.

“Subordinates will do their best!” Luotian bowed, his voice sincere—his acting was improving.

“Here’s the plan…” Fu Xingyue explained, and Luotian feigned ignorance, listening attentively.

“Subordinates will not disappoint you! Though I can’t help with strength, with enough herbs, I’m confident in producing one Holy-grade中级 elixir daily!” Luotian boasted.

“Good, time is tight—no rest for you,” Fu Xingyue sighed.

“No need to rest!” Luotian had already rested outside the city.

“However, Second Prince—there’s a problem. Star Moon Pavilion is surrounded!” Luotian apologized.

“What? I’ll see who dares surround us!” Fu Xingyue’s face darkened.

Before Luotian could speak, he grabbed him and exited the hall, stepping into Star Moon Pavilion’s gates. His face turned cold.

The pavilion was surrounded by frenzied admirers, more arriving from afar.

“Damn! Let them go!” Fu Xingyue coldly ordered, his aura rising.
