“Truly surprising!” The old man’s face still bore a smile, his withered body had cracks but they rapidly healed.

“Effective. I don’t believe I can’t kill you today!” Luo Tian’s sweat dripped down his face as his hands once again manipulated the golden palace, which coalesced with overwhelming might above his head.

“Luo Tian is going all out!” Diao Dezhu and the others watched Luo Tian, knowing they could not aid him now unless they entered the rank of Primordial Sovereigns.

“Still not giving up!” The old man roared, raising the green ancient coffin again, awaiting the descent of the ancient palace.

“Boom…!” The power surged, and the golden palace collided with the green coffin, exploding in a cataclysmic clash that sent waves of destruction outward.

“You can use it how many times?” The old man’s mouth bled, his face twisted with ferocity as he stood beneath the green coffin, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” Before the old man’s words had finished, several sharp glimmers shot from Luo Tian’s hands and instantly appeared before the old man.

Chapter 1597: Unity ()

The glimmers flashed, piercing the old man’s arms with lightning speed. He had just repelled the ancient palace and hadn’t caught his breath yet, being struck by silver needles.

The Eight Sealing Needles—taught to Luo Tian by Run Hongyu—were used again, sealing the old man’s meridians on his arms and rendering them numb.

“Again this trick!” The old man’s face darkened, gazing at the eight silver needles on his arms. Previously, he had nearly drained Run Hongyu’s blood with these needles, ruining his plan. Now Luo Tian repeated the move, inciting the old man’s fury. His other hand shot out to remove the needles.

But Luo Tian would not grant him the chance. With a wave, the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map descended with overwhelming divine power, slowing the old man’s movements. Simultaneously, Luo Tian activated the Sealing King’s Martial Art, appearing before the old man and punching his head.

“Go…!” The old man roared with fury, no longer caring about his numb arm. He punched Luo Tian.

“Crack…!” The thunderous sound returned, and the old man lost an arm, his power significantly diminished. Luo Tian clashed fists with him but no longer looked as helpless; he took a few steps back, his qi churning. His second punch erupted forth.

“One… two…” Luo Tian’s fists flashed repeatedly, striking the old man relentlessly. Each punch materialized before the old man.

The邪灵 (Evil Spirit) had lost an arm, managing to block most of Luo Tian’s attacks but still sustaining numerous blows, his body retreating.

“This isn’t working!” Luo Tian’s face darkened as he continued striking, but the Evil Spirit’s flesh was too formidable. Though he had struck the Evil Spirit many times, only shallow cracks formed on its body—no real damage.

Yet Luo Tian dared not stop; if he did, the Evil Spirit would retrieve the needles from its other arm and regain freedom. Then he’d be back to square one.

“Must I really use the bones from the Yin Fish?” Luo Tian’s mind grew anxious. This wasn’t sustainable; prolonged combat would exhaust both his body and cultivation.

The only methods he could think of to threaten the Evil Spirit were either unleashing the Yin Fish’s bones or re-manifesting the ancient palace.

But manifesting the ancient palace drained immense energy; with his current strength, he could only do it three times. Beyond that, his cultivation would be drained. If he failed to kill the Evil Spirit, he’d truly become a sitting duck.

Yet Luo Tian hesitated to use the Yin Fish’s bones. He hadn’t found the White Bone Bamboo yet; who knew what terrifying entities awaited next? In the second layer, he had already seen a Primordial Sovereign’s flesh. What awaited in the third?

Moreover, even if he manifested the ancient palace, the old man’s coffin would still protect him. This made Luo Tian abandon the idea of re-manifesting the ancient palace.

“Damn it!” The Evil Spirit was equally frustrated, possessing a powerful body but constantly suppressed by Luo Tian.

“What else can I do?” Luo Tian’s mind raced, his eyes narrowing with a ruthless glint.

“Reverse Blood Pill!” He thought of it instantly. Though the side effects were severe, it was his only viable option now.

“I’ll help Brother!” Chen Zhanbiao stepped out from beneath the Yin-Yang Twin Fish’s barrier, watching Luo Tian suppress the Evil Spirit but realizing he was still not as strong as before.

Chen Zhanbiao took a step forward, his towering body instantly appearing between Luo Tian and the Evil Spirit.

“Zhanbiao!” Luo Tian sensed Chen Zhanbiao’s arrival, frowning slightly but not stopping him.

He knew Chen Zhanbiao’s flesh was suitable for aiding in the fight against the two old men, becoming a significant asset.

“Zhanbiao, be careful!” Xu Liziyi and others shouted from within the barrier, knowing only Chen Zhanbiao could assist Luo Tian now. After all, he was the son of an ancient king and his flesh was equally monstrous—thick-skinned and resilient, able to withstand the Evil Spirit’s attacks and ease Luo Tian’s burden.

“Boom…!” As Chen Zhanbiao spoke, he charged like a savage beast toward the old man’s front, his massive fists pounding relentlessly. Each strike was astonishingly powerful, repeatedly striking the old man’s body.

“Pound… pound…” The collision sounds echoed constantly, and with Chen Zhanbiao’s aid, Luo Tian felt a sigh of relief.

“Why is this old man so tough? It feels like I’m hitting iron!” Chen Zhanbiao grumbled, his body aching from the blows but still attacking relentlessly.

The thunderous clashes continued until the Evil Spirit was driven into a wall, yet it still showed no signs of catching its breath.

“This flesh is too变态 (abnormal)!” Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin remarked, watching the Evil Spirit embedded in the wall, still being pounded by Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao. “Even a Primordial Sovereign might struggle against this!”

“Let’s strike together and finish him!” Sun Mengru’s face was cold. If they continued like this, Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao would eventually be worn down by the terrifying flesh.

“Haha, you little brats—don’t even dream of defeating me! Primordial Sovereigns are invincible, in body and all other aspects. Even if this flesh is weakened, you cannot insult it!” The Evil Spirit’s face twisted with ferocity.

“Spit!” Before the old man could finish, Xu Liziye stepped out from the Yin-Yang Twin Fish barrier and spat directly onto the old man’s face.

“Old bastard, what if I insult you? I’m the first to spit on a Primordial Sovereign!” Xu Liziye crossed his arms, standing behind Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao with disdain.

“You…” The old man felt the sticky substance on his face, his expression darkening in fury.

“Ah…!” The old man roared, unleashing terrifying power that seemed to break Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao’s hold.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, surprised by Xu Liziye’s timing.

“Why didn’t I think of this? This is a chance to show off!” Diao Dezhu slapped his thigh, regretful. Such an opportunity had slipped past him.

As he spoke, Diao Dezhu transformed into a streak of purple light, instantly appearing behind Luo Tian and spitting two more times. Unfortunately, the spit landed directly into the Evil Spirit’s mouth.

“Those two bastards!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, wondering how they could still have the leisure to show off at such a time.

“You’ll all die!” The Evil Spirit roared, his fury escalating. Feeling the sticky substance on his face, his eyes turned red with rage.

He was an Evil Spirit born from a Primordial Sovereign’s flesh, and he had long considered himself the true sovereign. Now insulted like this, how could he endure it?

“Good opportunity!” Though the Evil Spirit’s rage increased Luo Tian’s pressure, it also exposed several fatal weaknesses.

“Stop fooling around and strike together to finish him!” Sun Mengru sighed, watching Xu Liziye and Diao Dezhu’s antics.

Hearing Sun Mengru’s cold tone, Xu Liziye and Diao Dezhu returned to the group with a touch of awkwardness, especially Diao Dezhu’s swaying gait, which was incredibly annoying.

“We’ll try too!” Zheng Xin and others felt eager; future tales of this would surely bring them glory. Who else had ever spat on a Primordial Sovereign?

“Stop hesitating; don’t you see they’re nearly exhausted?” Sun Mengru held a golden sword, its light radiating ten thousand feet. The final move of the Taiyi Nine Swords erupted from her blade.

Hearing Sun Mengru’s words, others straightened their faces. Seeing Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao still attacking relentlessly, they began to gather formidable attacks toward the trio.

Destructive waves erupted from their hands, each technique a terrifying display of power. Even Luo Tian felt the challenge.

“Go!” Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao exchanged a glance, sensing the terrifying waves behind them. They quickly retreated; they dared not face the combined attack head-on.

As their figures vanished, several devastating techniques appeared before the Evil Spirit.

“Huff…!” Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao panted heavily, their arms feeling like they weren’t theirs.

Chapter 1598: Consuming the Reverse Blood Pill ()

“One Sword to the Primordial…”
“Purple Qi from the East… Vast Three Thousand…” Sun Mengru, Diao Dezhu, Xu Liziye and others unleashed powerful techniques that one after another struck the Evil Spirit as it regained its senses.

The entire hall became chaotic, yet it remained remarkably sturdy, showing no signs of collapse. Vast void currents swept through the hall, thunderous explosions echoed constantly, and dust obscured their vision.

“This should have wounded that old man!” Everyone’s faces bore anticipation as they watched the lingering chaos, their eyes fixed on the Evil Spirit.

“Return!” After catching his breath, Luo Tian called to them. He knew their combined attack was formidable but still slightly inferior to the ancient palace he had manifested. It might wound the Evil Spirit, but it would not kill him.

“Go…” Luo Tian stretched his numb arms and dashed into the dust toward the old man’s direction.

Chen Zhanbiao wiped his forehead and followed Luo Tian into the dust, while Diao Dezhu and others returned to the Yin-Yang Twin Fish barrier.

However, as they entered the dust, almost instantly they reached the wall where they had previously subdued the Evil Spirit. Their faces darkened immediately.

Before them, a deep human-shaped imprint remained on the wall, its surface glowing with divine light. The collapsed wall slowly restored itself but had lost the Evil Spirit’s presence.

“Where is he?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light, scanning for the Evil Spirit’s trace. His mind remained cautious.

“Little brats, you all must die!” The cold voice echoed through the hall, startling Luo Tian’s group.

“Crash…!” The scattered dry bones on the floor began to tremble and coalesce. A few fragments of bone with divine radiance rapidly fused together.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed, and a white-bone sword materialized instantly. A ghostly figure appeared before the sword, grasping it and vanishing from sight.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his body tensing as Chen Zhanbiao’s large eyes stared intently.

In an instant, a dangerous aura filled Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao’s senses, but they still couldn’t locate the Evil Spirit.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed throughout the hall. As the dust cleared, Luo Tian’s eyes suddenly flared.

“Zhanbiao, be careful!” He shouted at Chen Zhanbiao, sensing a streak of light flying toward him.

“Good…” Before Chen Zhanbiao could respond, his body instinctively dodged.

This dodge was purely from Chen Zhanbiao’s years of combat instincts and his sense of danger.

“Plop…” The white-bone sword turned red, piercing Chen Zhanbiao’s abdomen. Blood gushed from his mouth immediately.

“Zhanbiao!” Luo Tian’s eyes nearly burst into flames, instantly appearing before Chen Zhanbiao.

“Lucky little brat; next time you won’t be so fortunate!” The low voice echoed from the hall’s distance. The battered Evil Spirit, holding a bloodstained bone sword, stood in a corner of the hall. His face twisted with hatred as he watched Luo Tian before Chen Zhanbiao.

Yet the Evil Spirit’s state was not as strong as before; his clothes were torn, blood dried on his lips, and his withered body bore numerous cracks. Clearly, the combined attack had inflicted significant damage.

“Cough… cough…” Chen Zhanbiao spat blood, his abdomen a gaping wound. His previously dark complexion had turned pale, indicating severe injuries.

“Zhanbiao, are you okay?” Luo Tian asked as he grabbed Chen Zhanbiao and rushed him into the Yin-Yang Twin Fish barrier, where they were surrounded.

“Fine… just a bit weak.” Chen Zhanbiao smiled, his monstrous flesh’s self-healing ability beginning to take effect. The blood gradually stopped flowing.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with concern; he knew if Chen Zhanbiao hadn’t instinctively dodged, that bone sword would have severely wounded him.

“What do we do?” Diao Dezhu and others looked to Luo Tian, the very thing they dreaded had happened. They were once again at a disadvantage against the Primordial Sovereign’s flesh, nearly despairing.

“Leave it to me!” Luo Tian stepped out of the barrier and held the Reverse Blood Pill in his hand. This time, he had no hesitation; he swallowed it instantly.

“Going all out?” The Evil Spirit looked at Luo Tian with disdain, not even considering the medicine he had consumed. After all, though it had suffered some damage, its flesh was still formidable and unafraid of any of Luo Tian’s methods.

Destroying these young men with strong blood qi and fully absorbing their energy would allow it to completely revive this supreme flesh, then cultivate the Primordial Power and become the ultimate sovereign of yore.

As the Evil Spirit mused over his glorious future, the Reverse Blood Pill’s effects began to take hold. The Evil Spirit’s face suddenly startled, then rushed toward Luo Tian with the bone sword.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s body ignited with blood qi, an invisible wave radiating from him. His entire body turned red as the Reverse Blood Pill’s effects surged forth.

“Ah…” His blood qi burned constantly, transforming into a series of crimson dragons that converged into an overwhelming power, flowing into his dantian. The golden Wheel of Reincarnation in Luo Tian’s dantian changed again, roaring as it gradually expanded.

A wild aura radiated from Luo Tian’s body, and the overwhelming pressure made Diao Dezhu and others express surprise.

“What medicine is this? It’s so astonishing! We never heard of it from Luo Tian before!” Their faces changed instantly as they saw Luo Tian’s overwhelming power.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Three thunderous sounds echoed in Luo Tian’s dantian. The golden Wheel of Reincarnation finally solidified within his dantian, glowing with light and radiating a wild Primordial Power that flowed through the channel.

“This is the power of a near-Primordial Sovereign!” Luo Tian slowly clenched his fists, feeling unusually strong. Even the Evil Spirit’s Primordial Sovereign flesh no longer seemed so towering to him.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian’s aura surged, the Evil Spirit attacked immediately, streaking toward him with a white-bone sword.

However, the Reverse Blood Pill’s effects were astonishingly effective; as the bone sword appeared before Luo Tian, his aura stabilized instantly.

“Now, what qualifications do you have to be arrogant in front of me?” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness. He bent his body, and the white-bone sword passed by him.

Luo Tian seized the opportunity to activate the Sealing King’s Martial Art, instantly enhancing his fists with two great techniques. The Dao of Sealing and Demons struck the Evil Spirit’s chest directly.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed, and the Evil Spirit was instantly sent flying backward. Luo Tian took two steps back but his body glowed with golden light, resembling a celestial warrior.

“Feeling good!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, then planted his foot and bent his body, launching himself forward toward the Evil Spirit.

The Evil Spirit’s face bore disbelief; as he flew back, his sunken chest slowly recovered but his lips continuously bled.

“How could you be so strong!” Though the Evil Spirit had prepared for Luo Tian’s desperate state, he hadn’t expected that a desperate Luo Tian could be so powerful—so strong that even his flesh was wounded.

As he chased the Evil Spirit, Luo Tian’s hands formed a seal, and a golden vortex rose above the hall, filling it completely. A terrifying pressure radiated from the vortex.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s strongest power was not his flesh but his cultivation—Primordial Power at the level of a near-Primordial Sovereign. Luo Tian was confident that his current state could withstand any near-King or near-Primordial Sovereign and even suppress them.

The entity that had taken over the Supreme Sovereign’s flesh was merely relying on its supreme body, but since it lacked blood qi, it fell far behind a true Primordial Sovereign. Plus, it had suffered multiple injuries already; this advantage no longer existed for Luo Tian now.

The technique of the second Primordial Sovereign, Jie Tian, was now unleashed by Luo Tian in this state. It was terrifying; the overwhelming pressure made the entire hall tremble, and with a thunderous roar, the golden seal descended upon the Evil Spirit.

“Damn it! How could this be!” The Evil Spirit’s face bore anger and shock. Compared to before, Luo Tian was completely different—unrecognizably so.

As the Evil Spirit panicked, Luo Tian’s ghostly figure appeared before him instantly, and the Heavenly Thunder Sword was in his hand.

“Sword… no… limit…” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, and the green thunder sword instantly pierced toward the Evil Spirit.

Chapter 1599: Thoughts ()

The Evil Spirit saw Luo Tian’s sword approaching and felt a strong sense of danger. Above his head, the Jie Tian Seal also terrified him.

“Crack…” The white-bone sword was raised, instantly colliding with the Heavenly Thunder Sword.

“Crash… crash…” A sound of breaking followed, echoing throughout the hall. The indestructible bone sword was shattered by Luo Tian’s technique, breaking into pieces and falling to the ground.

“Plop…” The green sword continued without stopping, piercing the Evil Spirit’s hand. However, due to the bone sword’s defense, most of its power was weakened, leaving only a single blood spot on the Evil Spirit’s hand before stopping.

“Boom…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate; he withdrew instantly, planting his foot and retreating. The massive Jie Tian Seal was slowly descending.

The golden seal radiated overwhelming might, seemingly able to suppress everything. Especially the Heavenly Power extracted by the Jie Tian Seal had a natural suppression effect on the Evil Spirit. However, previously Luo Tian’s power couldn’t harm the Evil Spirit.

“Flee!” Facing such a powerful Jie Tian Seal, the Evil Spirit dared not fight directly and fled toward the distance.

“Can’t escape!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness. He waved his hand, and an invisible wave radiated from it. The Eight Directions’ Treasure Retrieval Technique combined with powerful spiritual awareness swept over the golden seal, following the Evil Spirit and instantly crushing it onto his body.

“Boom… boom…” The thunderous sound echoed, golden light radiating outward again. Each divine law continuously struck the hall’s walls, leaving deep traces.

“Terrifying! So terrifying! That old thing who had previously suppressed Luo Tian is now at his mercy. This pill of Luo Tian’s is truly astonishing!” Diao Dezhu and others’ eyes gleamed with admiration, gazing at Luo Tian.

This pill could elevate a cultivation level to near-Primordial Sovereign. If it were mass-produced, their Four Holy Domains could conquer nine regions.

However, they soon shook their heads; they knew it wasn’t that simple. Perhaps only Luo Tian could use it to ascend to near-Primordial Sovereign; others might not. After all, such a pill was too astonishingly powerful. And Luo Tian hadn’t used it initially—clearly, it had side effects.

The smoke cleared, and the Evil Spirit stood bleeding, panting heavily. Clearly, that blow had wounded him severely.

“Manifest the Body of Heaven and Earth!” Luo Tian formed a seal with his hands, then his body suddenly expanded. His formidable flesh rose to another level. At this moment, Luo Tian fully entered his strongest state, his towering figure seemingly about to burst through the hall’s ceiling.

“Fury of the Barbarian God Treads Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian took a step forward, as if the Barbarian God had returned. His golden foot descended upon the Evil Spirit standing there.

“Ah…” The Evil Spirit roared, gazing at the unparalleled golden foot above his head. His hands were raised high; without Primordial Power, he had to rely on his flesh to defend.

“Boom…” The golden foot struck the Evil Spirit’s hands, shattering them instantly. The Evil Spirit’s body bent forward.

Before the Evil Spirit could straighten up, Luo Tian’s second step had no pause and fell again on the Evil Spirit’s raised hands.

“Crack…” This time, the Evil Spirit could no longer endure; he knelt on the ground, and the entire hall trembled constantly.

“Seventh Step… Eighth Step… Ninth Step…” Luo Tian took one step after another. He knew his time was limited—only a moment left. Thus, he gave the Evil Spirit no chance to catch his breath; if the Evil Spirit endured for a moment, they would be the ones in trouble.

“Barbarian Seven Steps Shatter Eternity!” The seven steps of the Barbarian God were taken, and the golden foot, with supreme power, crashed down upon the Evil Spirit lying on the ground.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming; except for Diao Dezhu and others under the Yin-Yang Twin Fish barrier and the green ancient coffin standing there, everything else in the hall was annihilated without a trace.

“How is it?” Diao Dezhu and others anxiously watched the battlefield, knowing this was Luo Tian’s strongest move.

When Luo Tian took his seventh step, the overwhelming aura made even them under the Yin-Yang Twin Fish barrier feel suffocated.

“Haha, little brat, you can’t kill me! As long as your attacks don’t pierce this flesh, I won’t die!” The weak voice echoed through the hall, making Diao Dezhu and others’ faces change instantly.

“How could this be? He’s still alive!” Zheng Xin and others couldn’t help but exclaim. They hadn’t expected this old thing to still be alive under these circumstances.

“Still not dead?” Luo Tian was also surprised; he knew how powerful his attack had been. Even a true near-Primordial Sovereign would have vanished under his seventh step.

“Then again!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness, and he raised his foot high again. However, as he took a step forward, he glanced at the Evil Spirit and his foot hesitated to fall.

Through the thick mist, the Evil Spirit lay on the ground in a pitiful state, his eyes weak and lifeless like a dead fish.

“Lacking strength?” Luo Tian’s lips slightly curled, sensing the Evil Spirit’s extremely weak state. He pondered a thought.

“This is truly the flesh of a Primordial Sovereign!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, then transmitted mentally to Sun Mengru: “Mengru, release the Soul-Eating Silkworm. If we can preserve this flesh, it would be ideal!”

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Mengru’s eyes brightened. She could also sense the Evil Spirit’s state—though it relied on the formidable flesh of a Primordial Sovereign, its body was thick-skinned and resilient. In truth, the Evil Spirit itself wasn’t particularly formidable.

“Buzz…” Sun Mengru nodded to Luo Tian, and a black earring-like object on her ear flew out from before her, turning into a streak of dark light and rushing through the Yin-Yang Twin Fish barrier.

“Old bastard, do you think I can’t handle you?” Luo Tian smiled, estimating the remaining time of the Reverse Blood Pill. He felt there was still enough time for the Soul-Eating Silkworm to act, so he spoke to the Evil Spirit.

“Haha, this flesh isn’t as simple as you think. Though it looks severely wounded now, to annihilate it would take a day at least!” The Evil Spirit seemed calm. If Luo Tian wanted to drag this out, he was more than willing.

After all, it gave the flesh time to recover. If this flesh recovered, he was confident in facing Luo Tian now without being as helpless as before.

One old man and one young, both harboring their own thoughts, exchanging meaningless words. Their mutual hostility made Diao Dezhu and others bewildered.

“What’s wrong with Luo Tian? He doesn’t take advantage of his enemy, instead chatting with this old bastard!” Diao Dezhu and others looked at Luo Tian with confusion, but out of trust in him, they didn’t ask.

“Little brat, wait and see; when your state fades, I’ll torment you to death!” The Evil Spirit muttered internally. Then he felt a slight itch on one of his wounds, but didn’t pay much attention—after all, it was normal for a wound to itch as it healed.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly, watching the black dot creeping into the Evil Spirit’s wound. His lips curled slightly.

“Old bastard, I’m giving you time to recover—what can you do? You’re still no match for me!” Luo Tian continued, his voice filled with disdain.

“Then dare you wait half a moment? After that, I’ll definitely take your life!” The Evil Spirit tried to delay time, and Luo Tian intentionally cooperated.

Time flowed slowly. Luo Tian calculated the remaining time was about right. He looked at Sun Mengru, who also gazed at him with her golden eyes and nodded slightly. This made Luo Tian’s heart rejoice.

“Old bastard, no need for half a moment; I’ll send you to your death now!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness as he spoke to the Evil Spirit.

“Haha, little brat, you dream too much! Thank you for giving me this recovery time. Though my state isn’t good now, I can still withstand your attacks!” The Evil Spirit laughed aloud. Under Diao Dezhu and others’ eyes, he slowly stood up.

“Wow! This flesh’s recovery ability is too变态 (abnormal)! It was almost crushed by Luo Tian, but now it’s lively again!” Diao Dezhu and others looked at the old man standing proudly with disbelief.

“Send me to my death, I’ll show you how!” The Evil Spirit’s face bore ferocity as he looked at Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu. His cold voice made them shiver involuntarily.

“Soul-Eating!” However, Sun Mengru under the Yin-Yang Twin Fish barrier’s lips slightly curled. Her cold voice came from her red lips, making Diao Dezhu and others’ faces instantly brighten.

“Ah…” As Sun Mengru’s words finished, the Evil Spirit with a triumphant expression suddenly twisted his face in agony. His scream echoed through the hall.

Chapter 1600: Deployment ()

“Ah…” The agonizing scream rose in the hall, like a pig being slaughtered—grating and unbearable. Luo Tian’s group instinctively covered their ears.

“Soul-Eating Silkworm!” Diao Dezhu and others felt joy as Sun Mengru said the word “Soul-Eating.” They knew of the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s existence.

“A thing that subdues another!” Everyone’s faces bore admiration, their bodies trembling slightly as they watched the Evil Spirit lying on the ground, repeatedly headbutting it.

“Get out of my way! What are you?!” The Evil Spirit shouted, feeling his soul being devoured by something. Its speed was terrifying.

“Old bastard, now you’re afraid!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his body returning to normal size. His face bore mockery as he walked toward the Evil Spirit.

“What technique did you use? Make that thing leave!” The Evil Spirit shouted, his voice filled with agony and endless hatred. Red light radiated from the Evil Spirit’s body, as if trying to escape this flesh.

“Ugh…” A groaning sound echoed in their ears. Before the Evil Spirit could escape from this flesh, a swallowing and devouring aura rose within this supreme flesh. Only Luo Tian and Sun Mengru could sense it.

“I’ll never forgive you!” A low, venomous voice echoed from the Supreme Sovereign’s flesh. This venomous sound made even Luo Tian shudder.

“You’ll all die, even if not in this second layer, you’ll die in the next!” The spirit’s voice echoed. Then it completely vanished from the hall.

The black dot emerged from the Supreme Sovereign’s flesh, then transformed into a little girl’s form. Her eyes bore drowsiness as she rushed to Sun Mengru.

“Mother, I’m sleepy! I want to sleep!” The little girl resembled a neighbor’s child. Diao Dezhu and others’ lips twitched.

No one could imagine that this seemingly harmless little girl had defeated an enemy even Luo Tian couldn’t.

“Sleep well!” Sun Mengru’s maternal instincts were stirred by the Soul-Eating Silkworm. Her face softened, and she gently patted the silkworm.

“Hmm…” The Soul-Eating Silkworm nodded, then transformed into a black dot again. It landed on Sun Mengru’s ear. Obviously, devouring the Evil Spirit’s soul was a great nourishment for the silkworm.

“Huff…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, sitting on the ground. His face bore weakness as he looked at the withered Supreme Sovereign’s flesh.

“How are you, Luo Tian?” Seeing his state, others surrounded him. They felt his aura rapidly declining, making their faces worry. They knew the side effects were about to appear.
