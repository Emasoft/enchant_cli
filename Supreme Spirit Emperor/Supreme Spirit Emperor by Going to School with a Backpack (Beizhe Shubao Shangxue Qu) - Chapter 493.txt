After the incident with Guan Hongsheng, Luo Tian became far more cautious in his actions, fearing another instance of "the mantis catching the cicada, with the oriole waiting in ambush." Thus, Luo Tian no longer wished to be the mantis but instead aimed to become the oriole.

"I also have brothers!" Luo Tian muttered softly, then shouted aloud toward the sky.

"Brothers! If you don't act now, I'll be done for here!" Luo Tian's voice echoed powerfully through the mountains, reverberating across the landscape.

"Has he allies?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, people's faces shifted slightly, their gazes turning wary.

"Haha! Finally called for us. You've been playing the hero long enough—now it's our turn!" As Luo Tian's words faded, a chorus of laughter erupted from all directions.

"Buzz..." At that moment, waves of energy surged around the vast Eagle's Grief Valley, and countless array flags emerged, encircling the entire valley.

Nan Gong Yuqing, Diao Dezhu, and Li Tianzhi appeared with smiles on their faces, swiftly flying out to stand before Luo Tian—but Wanyi Kong was absent.

"Haha! Is this your so-called allies? A bunch of trash. I could crush you with a single hand!" One True Immortal sneered, unaware of the array flags.

Other True Immortals laughed as well. To claim they could eliminate several Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage disciples was absurd, a joke that would be laughed at by all.

"Begin!" Wanyi Kong stood outside the Eagle's Grief Valley, his face cold as he plunged a golden array flag into the ground.

"Zhou Tian Cultivation Array! Activate!"

"Wan Dao Immortal Subjugation Array! Activate!"

"..." Wanyi Kong's face remained expressionless as he continued to plant array flags into the earth. Each flag released a burst of golden light.

"Boom... Boom..." Thunderous roars echoed as the sky darkened with thick clouds, instantly plunging the Eagle's Grief Valley into darkness. A terrifying pressure brewed in the heavens and earth.

"Damn!" Seeing the impenetrable clouds, Luo Tian leaped in alarm. He recalled Wanyi Kong's past array—Heavenly Punishment of the Ten Thousand Realms.

"Nan Gong Yuqing, take this. Also give it to your apprentice and elder brother!" Nan Gong Yuqing swiftly retrieved several array flags, handing them to Luo Tian, Sun Keinian, and Cen Weihong.

"Do you have confidence?" Luo Tian's face showed doubt as he took the array flags. Wanyi Kong had always given him an unreliable impression.

"Rest assured, only a dozen True Immortal Initial Stage disciples. If we have enough time to prepare, even Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage could be eliminated!" Diao Dezhu's face bore a triumphant grin, imagining the look of shock on the dozen True Immortal Initial Stage disciples' faces. He planned to gloat thoroughly.

"Haha! A bunch of Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage disciples, setting up an array—how strong could it be?" Huang Youshan's face still bore disdain. Though the sky's aura was formidable, he dismissed it entirely.

"Attack! Kill them. I have a bad feeling," one True Immortal elder spoke solemnly, sensing an ominous premonition.

"Buzz..." But as the group prepared to move, waves of energy enveloped them instantly, causing their faces to pale.

"What's happening? Why does my True Immortal power move so slowly?" One True Immortal Initial Stage exclaimed in alarm.

As this disciple spoke, others' faces turned pale as well. Their powerful True Immortal energy moved sluggishly, and even more terrifyingly, their cultivation levels began to be ruthlessly suppressed.

"Half-True Immortal..." The dozen faces darkened, their eyes filled with fear. They had instantly regressed to Half-True Immortal.

"Ah... What array is this..." The dozen cried out, feeling their cultivation levels being forcibly stripped away.

In contrast to these disciples, Luo Tian's group radiated an intense surge of power.

"Haha..." Xuan Dan let out a thunderous cry, no longer restrained. With two hands, he struck—red and green palms, radiating overwhelming might, slamming into the dejected Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi.

"Boom... Boom..." Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi were crushed like flies, collapsing mountains in their wake.

"What's happening!" Everyone's faces were filled with terror. They hadn't expected this array to be so fearsome.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The sound of thunderous roars erupted from Luo Tian's group, their cultivation levels rapidly increasing.

"Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage... Heavenly Immortal Late Stage..."

In an instant, they surged to Heavenly Immortal Late Stage. The dozen's auras were overwhelming, even Luo Tian's face was filled with disbelief. He clenched his fists, feeling stronger than before by several times. No longer did the dozen True Immortals seem insurmountable.

"Brothers, fight! Today is our brothers' battle to make a name in the Immortal realm—kill True Immortals with Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage!" Wanyi Kong's voice rang out.

"Quickly attack and kill them. If we drop further, we truly won't be their match!" The dozen were now frantic, sensing their cultivation levels continuously fading. If they dropped to Heavenly Immortal Late Stage, Xuan Dan alone could sweep them aside.

"Boom... Boom..." As the dozen's words faded, countless lightning bolts erupted from the clouds, thousands of them raining down like a storm.

"An upgraded version of the Heaven's Punishment Array! Enjoy it!" Diao Dezhu stood on Luo Tian's shoulder, his purple eyes flashing with cold light.

In an instant, multicolored lightning descended, transforming the entire Eagle's Grief Valley into a sea of electricity.

"Ah..." A bolt struck one True Immortal elder, instantly wounding him. His body smoked and blackened.

"This is the lightning of a True Immortal's trial!" The dozen True Immortals' faces turned pale. They had all endured a True Immortal's trial and knew the power of this lightning.

"Kill..." As the dozen were stunned, Luo Tian's group charged forward as if unaffected. The terrifying lightning seemed sentient, twisting to strike the valley's mountains instead of them, causing the mountain ranges to collapse endlessly.

"Huang Youshan! Come on! Back then you wanted to catch me as a pet, today I'll show you what it means to be a pet!" Diao Dezhu shouted loudly, his voice brimming with arrogance.

In the apocalyptic lightning, Luo Tian's group charged like divine beings, impervious to all. They surged toward the dozen True Immortal elders.

Chapter 1904: Journey to Star River Mansion

Turbulent energy filled the heavens and earth, transforming the Eagle's Grief Valley into a flat plain. Luo Tian's group fled toward Star River Mansion like a plague.

As they departed, several streaks of light appeared above the Eagle's Grief Valley. Several elders emerged, their faces dark with fury.

The elders were all white-haired but radiated immense power. Waves of energy formed around them, exchanging glances filled with both caution and fury.

"Old Man Lang, Old Man Li, what are you doing here!" One elder in purple robes looked at the others, demanding.

"I should ask you! My grandson Lang Xiuming's life thread was shattered. The final energy fluctuation was here!" A gray-robed elder's face darkened, his gaze fierce toward the others.

He believed one of them had killed his grandson. He had given his grandson many techniques; even a Heavenly Immortal Mid-Stage disciple would have struggled to kill Lang Xiuming. Plus, his grandson had two True Immortal Initial Stage disciples with him.

"My grandson Chang Ziyang is also dead!" The purple-robed elder's face darkened to the point of dripping water. He had initially thought it was Old Man Lang.

"My disciple's life thread also shattered!" Other elders' faces were equally dark, gazing at the vanished Eagle's Grief Valley, exchanging glances.

"Who is so bold as to attack our descendants? Do they wish to provoke a war across the Three Heavens!" The elders roared, though their descendants were纨绔, they were still their heart's treasures. To have them killed was unbearable.

"Search! We must find out who did this, and let him suffer a life worse than death!" They roared before turning away without acknowledging the others, flying in different directions.

...

At this moment, Luo Tian's group flew beneath the Three Heavens' sky. After a lively exchange with Long Jie, he returned to the Nai Pian Dragon Seal, as his presence was too conspicuous and would cause trouble.

"Star River Mansion is seven days away. However, we have no ascended disciples to deliver. I think it's better to return to the Lower Heavens," Xuan Dan spoke, expressing his thoughts.

Xuan Dan was concerned. They had killed disciples from the Middle Heavens' sects, and though they left no traces, it was possible they would be traced. In that case, escape would be impossible.

"Still go to Star River Mansion! Let them join Star River Mansion!" But Luo Tian insisted. If Star River Mansion didn't know they were delivering ascended disciples, there was no need to deliver them.

However, Luo Tian had his own thoughts. He wanted Nan Gong Yuqing and the others to enter Star River Mansion, as he felt Tianmen was not so easy to return. Entering Star River Mansion was the best option for Nan Gong Yuqing and others.

"Okay," Xuan Dan nodded. He knew Luo Tian had his own plans, and with Zhang Jinghuan, Du Chengshi, and Ke Zhenghao already dead, returning to Tianmen would bring trouble.

"Buzz..." As they discussed, a terrifying pressure suddenly descended. A streak of light appeared in Luo Tian's group's view.

The terrifying pressure instantly changed their faces, their bodies forcibly pressed to the ground.

When Luo Tian's group landed on the ground, a purple-robed elder stood in the sky above them, gazing down.

"True Immortal Late Stage!" Xuan Dan gasped, looking at the elder. They had just killed disciples from Middle Heavens' sects, and now a True Immortal Late Stage elder appeared. It was no wonder Xuan Dan felt tense.

"Are you disciples of Star River Mansion?" The purple-robed elder's eyes flickered slightly. Seeing that the strongest among them was only Xuan Dan, a True Immortal Initial Stage, and noticing the Star River Seals on Nan Gong Yuqing's group, he dismissed his suspicions.

In the purple-robed elder's view, even if Xuan Dan was strong, he couldn't have killed Chang Ziyang and others. That level of power required at least a True Immortal Mid-Stage or Late Stage.

"Yes, do you have any orders for us?" Xuan Dan suppressed his tension, showing respect. Though the elder looked about his age, their cultivation was leagues apart.

"Have you seen any True Immortal Mid-Stage or Late Stage masters?" The elder spoke solemnly, scanning Luo Tian's group with a critical gaze. He found them young but sensed an aura of sharpness, instinctively recognizing their extraordinariness.

"No, we were just on a training mission. We're returning to Star River Mansion to report," Xuan Dan replied, acting like a squad leader.

"Ah, go on. Tell Ye Wudao that someone killed my grandson. Have him investigate. If he finds out, I'll owe him a favor!" The elder finished and took off, flying away.

"Phew..." As the elder disappeared, Luo Tian's group sighed in relief. Even Xuan Dan had cold sweat on his face.

"It was too dangerous! Damn it, Sun Keinian, couldn't you choose better!" Luo Tian's group glared at Sun Keinian, feeling his mouth was too toxic.

"Damn it, this is my fault? If I hadn't said that, you would have left earlier. We'd be wiped out now!" Sun Keinian shouted indignantly, turning it into a boast.

"Go on," Luo Tian sighed deeply, feeling the Middle Heavens was where the most exciting events took place.

"The Middle Heavens has a hundred sects, each with immense power. It's like a contest of all schools, and these hundred sects are under the control of nine Immortal Mountains."

"Therefore, sects being destroyed is common. That's why we could participate in the Heaven-Struggle War—fighting for vacant spots!" Xuan Dan explained to Luo Tian about the situation in the Middle Heavens.

Overall, the entire Immortal realm was ruled by nine Immortal Mountains in the Upper Heavens. The Middle Heavens had a contest of all schools, but still under the control of nine Immortal Mountains. The Lower Heavens was more free, as its spiritual energy was much weaker than the Middle Heavens. The nine Immortal Mountains didn't care about it.

This Heaven-Struggle War was because a sect in the Middle Heavens had offended an Immortal King, angering him. The Immortal King destroyed one True Immortal Late Stage disciple and another True Immortal Late Stage elder.

This was the opportunity that Tianmen, Ditiemen, and three other sects most hoped for. In the past, successful Heaven-Struggle Wars were due to problems in a sect of the Middle Heavens. Otherwise, there were few successful cases.

"Ah! That's why these three sects are so focused on this!" Luo Tian's group suddenly understood.

After flying for seven days, they finally reached their destination—Star River Mansion.

A towering mountain radiated an imposing aura, standing before Luo Tian's group. They dared not fly and had to descend at the mountain's base.

"Star River Mansion's mountain body is made from an extraterrestrial meteorite. This meteorite was massive and had nine-tenths tungsten steel concentration, making it incredibly tough. Even a True Immortal Initial Stage disciple would need great effort to break through. The most precious treasure of Star River Mansion is this mountain!" Xuan Dan spoke softly, then led Luo Tian's group to the massive gate.

Two disciples in gray robes stood upright, their cultivation was only Heavenly Immortal Initial Stage but their eyes were sharp.

"Who are you?" Seeing Xuan Dan's group approaching, one disciple spoke, blocking Luo Tian.

"I am Xuan Dan of the Lower Heavens' Tianmen Sect. I found several Star River Mansion disciples and am escorting them back!" Xuan Dan smiled, addressing the gatekeepers.

Nan Gong Yuqing and others handed over Star River Seals to the two gatekeepers.

"Ah? This is a genuine Star River Seal! It's through Star River Mansion's test!" Seeing the seal, the two gatekeepers' faces changed abruptly.

"Wait a moment!" The two disciples' expressions improved, then they took the seal and transmitted to it.

In a grand hall of Star River Mansion, two middle-aged men were playing chess. One wore blood-red robes and radiated a bloody aura—clearly someone with a history of violence. The other wore gray robes and had an imposing presence.

The gray-robed man was Star River Mansion's sect master, Ye Wudao. The blood-red robed one was the head of Star River Mansion's Iron Blood Hall, Ye Tian, also Ye Wudao's younger brother.

"Sky, your chess skills have improved. But your killing intent is too heavy!" Ye Wudao smiled lightly, capturing Ye Tian's general.

"Big brother, I don't know how to play chess. Why do you force me to learn..." Ye Tian's cold face showed a hint of bitterness, tossing his chess piece away.

"Playing chess is good for your mind. Think about big brother—our three brothers, his achievements are the highest!" Ye Wudao smiled.

"Buzz..." As Ye Wudao tossed his chess piece, Ye Tian's blood-red seal glowed red, causing Ye Tian's face to shift slightly.

"Big brother, someone has brought a genuine Star River Seal!" Ye Tian spoke to Ye Wudao, his voice changing.

"What? A genuine Star River Seal!" Ye Wudao's face changed abruptly, then turned to joy.

"Let's go see!" Ye Wudao finished and vanished with Ye Tian into the hall.

Chapter 1905: Negotiations

At Star River Mansion's vast mountain, Luo Tian's group looked puzzled at the two gatekeepers, unsure why their reactions were so intense.

"Did you notice? Our seals are different from theirs. Theirs are just ordinary jade seals, but mine has faint starlight and Dao laws!" Nan Gong Yuqing looked puzzled.

"Ah, the Star River Seal was used to recruit disciples for Star River Mansion. We don't know why it was lost in the Nine Realms, so Star River Mansion naturally didn't issue any seals." Luo Tian spoke softly. He hadn't realized that Star River Mansion was now on his person.

After Luo Tian achieved the status of Epoch Lord, to be more secure in the Immortal path, he went to Star Realm and found Star River Mansion's spirit. He opened a path back to the Immortal realm, which fulfilled the spirit's wish. Otherwise, Star River Mansion's spirit wouldn't have given Luo Tian an inner disciple seal.

"Buzz..." As they discussed, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian's figures descended from the sky. Their powerful auras again changed Luo Tian's group's faces.

"Is it you who brought the Star River Seal?" Ye Wudao's face was calm, but Luo Tian's group knew his excitement from his eyes.

"Respect the Sect Master and Iron Blood Hall Head!" The two gatekeepers' faces changed immediately, looking at Ye Wudao and Ye Tian. When they looked at Ye Tian, their fear was even greater than when looking at Ye Wudao.

"I am Xuan Dan of the Lower Heavens' Tianmen Sect. I found Star River Mansion disciples and am returning them!" Xuan Dan bowed slightly, his face showing admiration.

Ye Wudao and Ye Tian didn't hear Xuan Dan's words, directly taking the seals from the two gatekeepers and examining them carefully.

"Haha! It's truly a Star River Seal!" Ye Wudao laughed, his voice filled with excitement.

"You three are now my Star River Mansion disciples. No! Inner disciples! Passing Star River Mansion's trials proves your talent!"

"Now follow me. Where did you get the seal? Where is Star River Mansion's divine artifact?" Ye Wudao laughed, even Ye Tian's cold face showed a hint of joy.

Star River Mansion was named after this divine artifact, proving its importance to Star River Mansion.

These years, Star River Mansion had invested much effort searching for the divine artifact's whereabouts but found no clues.

"Lower Heavens, the Endless Forest!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke softly, recounting what Luo Tian had prepared.

"Lower Heavens? We also went there before. I didn't expect it was in the Endless Forest!" Ye Wudao murmured, then his eyes flashed with light.

Luo Tian had made Nan Gong Yuqing do this to get Star River Mansion into the Lower Heavens, stirring up the waters.

"Alright, now show your seals. Whoever has a seal is my Star River Mansion disciple. We won't mistreat you!"

"Moreover, you've done great service to the sect. Whoever has a seal is an inner disciple!" Ye Wudao spoke loudly.

"Um, Master Sect Leader, if someone shows an inner disciple seal, how should you handle it?" Luo Tian licked his lips and asked Ye Wudao.

"Reckless! The Sect Leader has already let you skip the exam and join Star River Mansion. How dare you negotiate with the Sect Leader!" The two gatekeepers scolded immediately.

"Inner disciple's seal?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian's faces shifted slightly. They knew the difficulty of inner disciple trials in Star River Mansion, as Ye Wudao himself had passed them.

But they didn't know that due to the Nine Realms' circumstances, Star River Mansion's spirit had lowered the difficulty for Luo Tian's group. Otherwise, with their strength at that time, they wouldn't have passed.

"Of course not me. It's our great elder Cen Weihong!" Luo Tian looked respectful, gazing at Cen Weihong.

Luo Tian's words left everyone stunned. Their gazes turned to Cen Weihong, unsure what Luo Tian was up to.

"Cen Senior Brother, I see now that the seal you placed on me was a Star River Seal! This precious seal, how could my junior brother accept it!" Luo Tian extended his hand, handing the inner disciple's seal to Cen Weihong, causing him to be startled.

"It really is an inner disciple!" Ye Wudao took the seal, examined it carefully, then spoke loudly. His gaze swept over Cen Weihong.

"Good, he's a promising candidate!" Ye Wudao nodded. Then his gaze turned to Ye Tian.

"Sky, you still lack a disciple. Take this one in!" Ye Wudao spoke to Ye Tian.

"Good..." Ye Tian nodded, sensing Cen Weihong's cold aura was similar to his own. His eyes showed satisfaction.

"Would you like to be my disciple? From now on, leave Tianmen and become a Star River Mansion disciple!" Ye Tian looked at Cen Weihong.

"I refuse. I already have a master. If I were to take another, it would require my master's approval!" Cen Weihong shook his head. He didn't know why Luo Tian was giving this opportunity to him, but he respected Xuan Dan who had saved his life.

"Long have I heard that Tianmen in the Lower Heavens has a remarkable alchemist. Today, I finally meet you! Thank you, Xuan Dan Master, for escorting our Star River Mansion disciples here!" Ye Wudao smiled, looking at Xuan Dan.

"Master Ye is too kind. I merely did what was necessary!"

"As for Cen Weihong's discipleship, I naturally agree. If in the future we enter the Middle Heavens for the Heaven-Struggle War, I hope Master Ye will look after him!" Xuan Dan smiled at Ye Wudao.

"Ah, Tiange, you've arrived! I've heard about your great achievements!" As Xuan Dan and Ye Wudao spoke, a cheerful voice echoed in their ears. A man in gray robes strolled out of the gate, accompanied by a group of people with carefree expressions surrounding him.

As he spoke, Ye Tian also reached their side. His face was filled with joy as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Smack!" Ye Wudao slapped Ye Tian's head, his face filled with anger: "Idiot! What are you doing!"

"Dad... Uncle is also here..." Ye Tian's face changed immediately, his carefree expression gone. He looked like a good child.

"I was bored and wanted to go down the mountain!" Ye Tian spoke nervously. He hadn't expected Ye Wudao to be here. A few days ago, he had returned and brought back a dragon egg, which was a great achievement. Ye Wudao was delighted and gave him the remaining spiritual stones from the dragon egg auction—millions of them. Ye Tian wanted to use these to indulge with his friends from Star River Mansion.

"Go to hell!" Ye Wudao cursed, raising his hand again. But seeing Ye Tian's pitiful face and the large bump on his head, he put it down.

"Alright, go back. Today there are guests. You know them, so you'll entertain them!" Ye Wudao waved his sleeve and handed Luo Tian's group to Ye Tian. He then led Xuan Dan into the mountain, personally welcoming him.

"Tiange, you came without telling me beforehand!" Ye Tian carefully watched Ye Wudao leave before speaking to Luo Tian, slinging his arm around Luo Tian's shoulder.

"Come on! Now that we're in my territory, don't be polite. Let's go to my place and have a drink!" Ye Tian took charge, dragging Luo Tian into Star River Mansion. The two gatekeepers' faces showed envy.

"Listen up! This is my Tiange, greet him!" Entering Star River Mansion, Ye Tian shouted to the dozens around him.

"Tiange!" The dozens shouted in unison. Clearly, Ye Tian had absolute authority among them.

"Tiange, let me introduce you. This is a disciple of the Dark Star Hall. His father is the head of the hall... this one..." Ye Tian continuously introduced each person, each with influential backgrounds. These were typical princelings.

"Come on! Today we don't stop until we're drunk. Tomorrow, let's go kill everyone!" Ye Tian laughed and walked with Luo Tian, entering his luxurious courtyard.

"Okay..." Luo Tian smiled and introduced Nan Gong Yuqing's group to Ye Tian. After all, they needed Ye Tian's help to survive in Star River Mansion. Luo Tian knew these people were troublemakers.

The banquet table was always a place for men to build relationships. A feast left everyone drunk and close.

The next morning, Xuan Dan and Ye Tian entered the courtyard. Seeing the group drunk in a mess, Ye Tian's eye twitched. His cold aura instantly woke Luo Tian's group.

Chapter 1906: Beast Battle

In the Middle Heavens, sects competed constantly. People died at any moment.

However, disciples from the No-Door Sect Huang Youshan, Ziyang Mountain, and Chang Ziyang... were killed. Several True Immortal Initial Stage disciples protecting them also perished. This event spread throughout the Middle Heavens.

These disciples were famous in the Middle Heavens, not for their strength but for being纨绔. They had old masters behind them.

So many people were killed, causing their old masters to be furious. They united to find the one who had acted, but after several days of searching, they found no clues.

While the entire Middle Heavens discussed this matter, a massive dragon soared out of Star River Mansion toward Huantian City.

"Ugh... am I my father? I just returned and already have to deal with this!" On the dragon's back, Ye Tian sat with his legs crossed, lying lazily. His face showed reluctance.

"Why do I have to go? We all suffer!" Ye Tian's surrounding youths groaned loudly.

Luo Tian, Xuan Dan, Sun Keinian, and Duan Chengfeng stood there with smiles.

Duan Chengfeng had been like air during the journey, witnessing Luo Tian's group's terror. Now he had no other thoughts.

Luo Tian's group stayed in Star River Mansion for three days before leaving. Upon departure, Ye Tian pulled them up and assigned tasks—accompanying Luo Tian's group to the Lower Heavens to find Star River Mansion.

Because the Immortal realm had rules: those entering the Middle Heavens from the Upper Heavens must be below True Immortal Peak. Those entering the Lower Heavens from the Middle Heavens must not exceed True Immortal Initial Stage.

On the other hand, several elders stood there with bitter faces. Their auras were True Immortal Initial Stage.

They had also been sent by Ye Wudao to find Star River Mansion. They were also there to protect Ye Tian's group of princelings.

They knew Ye Wudao didn't want these princelings to cause trouble in the sect, so he had sent them out.

"Chang Ziyang, Lang... was killed by someone. The outside world is too dangerous. I don't know who the bastards are, but if I find out, I'll skin them. We've lost two more companions!" Ye Tian sighed, his face filled with sorrow.

"Listen! The old masters have united and called for the Heaven's Mechanism Sect's strength to investigate who acted. I believe it won't be long before we know!" A princeling disciple spoke softly.

"Heaven's Mechanism Sect!" Luo Tian and Xuan Dan exchanged glances, a bad feeling rising.

"Luo Tian, part ways here!" Sun Keinian spoke to Luo Tian, his voice filled with joy.

"Ah, take care!" Hearing Sun Keinian's words, Luo Tian nodded. He felt a little sad but knew that Sun Keinian was used to freedom. The sect life didn't suit him. Previously, he had given the Star River Seal to Yu Changtian.

"Brother, remember if anything happens, don't bear it alone! Who dares to hit you, I'll avenge for you. I'll dig up their ancestors' graves! Haha!" Sun Keinian laughed, his absurd revenge method making Luo Tian smile. They hugged.

"Go!" Sun Keinian patted Luo Tian's shoulder where Diao Dezhu was perched, then jumped off the dragon and flew away as a streak of light.

"Even without this bastard, I miss him!" Diao Dezhu's purple eyes gazed at Sun Keinian leaving, whispering softly.

"Everyone has their own path. We shouldn't stop them!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He could feel the Middle Heavens' life would be very exciting, many ascended disciples might be there.

Luo Tian had left Nan Gong Yuqing's group in Star River Mansion for this reason, wanting to visit old friends. Luo Tian chose to return to Tianmen because of his own plans—Chen Zhanbiao was still in Tianmen. Moreover, Luo Tian needed a place of his own, no longer living under others.

Thinking this, Luo Tian's gaze turned to Ye Tian and the six True Immortal Initial Stage disciples accompanying Star River Mansion. He gradually formed a plan. These people were now his capital.

The massive dragon flew for three more days, finally reaching their destination—the only convenient exit to the Lower Heavens, Huantian City.

Ye Tian's group jumped off the dragon and walked arrogantly into Huantian City. Like Huantian Island, Huantian City was a place of excess, even more terrifying than Huantian Island. In Huantian City, if you had spiritual stones, you were a big shot; whatever you wanted was yours. If not, you were worse than a beggar because even the beggars in Huantian City had lots of money.

Ye Tian's group couldn't help but draw attention. A dozen princelings walking the street were truly walking shoulder to shoulder, filling the entire street.

"Ye Shao has arrived!"

"Ye Shao is still as handsome as ever..." The beggars' voices filled with flattery, their faces showing joy and reciting New Year greetings.

"Again you lot!"

"Give it!" Ye Tian waved his hand, and piles of spiritual stones flew from his hands—tens of thousands of spiritual stones. Luo Tian and Xuan Dan's mouths twitched, surprised at Ye Tian's arrogance.

"Hey, Ye Tian! You're back to show off and throw money again!" As Ye Tian continued throwing spiritual stones, a group approached from the other side of the street. They were equally arrogant.

The leader was a young man in fine robes, his face pale with sunken eyes—clearly overindulged.

"Isn't this the Erectile Dysfunction Brother!" Ye Tian saw the group and his face showed mockery. His dozens of princeling disciples laughed.

"Ye Tian, why are you here? Don't you fear the same thing happening to you?" The young man's face was dark.

The young man, Liu Yangwei, was also a princeling of the Middle Heavens. However, Ye Tian was the first princeling, while this young man was second. They had never gotten along well. Ye Tian always dominated Liu Yangwei because he was richer.

"I can do whatever I want. You don't have the right to interfere. Good dogs don't block the way. Move!" Ye Tian sneered and walked toward the teleportation array.

"What? Ye Tian, today in Huantian City, don't you want to play a little?" Liu Yangwei's face showed a cold smile.
