“Nothing serious, I just need to rest here for a month!” Luo Tian said with a bitter smile, then explained the effects of Nai Xue Dan to everyone, causing them to suddenly understand.

“That’s right. The stronger the vital energy, the better the effect after taking Nai Xue Dan. Luo Tian is a Reincarnated Body, with strong vital energy, which allowed him to reach the realm of an Epoch Lord. With our bloodline power, we could never enter that realm!” They shook their heads, faces filled with disappointment.

“But the flesh of Master of the Heavens is absolutely insane. Even without vital energy, if it had some, one hand could crush all of us!” Zheng Xin said with admiration, speaking softly. This caused everyone, including Luo Tian, to fall silent.

Though they had narrowly escaped danger this time, they felt the terror of an Epoch Lord. Though Luo Tian had been the main force in the battle, he knew that without their cooperation and the effects of Nai Xue Dan, they would have surely lost.

It was sheer luck. Luo Tian summarized that their victory had been due to chance—chance the demon hadn’t drained Ruhongyu completely, chance he had learned the Eight Sealing Needles, and chance he possessed Nai Xue Dan. Otherwise, they would have been crushed.

“No matter what, the result is good!”

“Let’s collect Master of the Heavens’ flesh. It’s an invaluable treasure!” As they spoke, Luo Tian’s aura vanished, returning to an ordinary man. His face was grim as he addressed them.

“Thankfully I had suppressed the curse power earlier, or I wouldn’t be able to withstand it now,” Luo Tian said with a sigh.

“Ha ha…” Just as Luo Tian smiled bitterly, Diao Dezhu and the others circled around Master of the Heavens’ flesh, already scheming.

“Come on… record it!” Diao Dezhu said with a flirtatious grin, placing Master of the Heavens’ flesh on the ground and raising his fist as if to smash it. Zheng Xin and others held a crystal-like object, pointing it at themselves.

Luo Tian naturally recognized the crystal—it was a memory crystal used to preserve impressions, common in the cultivation world. He hadn’t expected these bastards to use it for such purposes.

“Ha ha! Once I get out of this, I’ll copy it millions of times and spread it across the Nine Realms. Then I’ll be someone who’s beaten an Epoch Lord!” Diao Dezhu laughed wildly, posing for Zheng Xin to record.

“Hurry up! Hurry and record it for me!” Zheng Xin said impatiently.

“What’s the rush? There’s plenty of time. One day per person is enough!” Diao Dezhu sneered, posing a few more times he considered heroic.

“Buzz…” But as Diao Dezhu smiled triumphantly, imagining how he’d show off upon returning to the Nine Realms, Master of the Heavens’ flesh behind him began emitting radiant light. However, Diao Dezhu remained in an excited state and didn’t notice the change.

“Dog… dog… dog!” Though Diao Dezhu hadn’t seen it, others noticed the withered flesh’s transformation, their mouths twitching.

“Run… run!” Xu Liyi shouted at Diao Dezhu, his voice filled with fear.

“Run where?!” Diao Dezhu sneered, turning to pat Master of the Heavens’ flesh on the shoulder. But his body shivered involuntarily.

“Boy, take your hand off!” A solemn voice echoed through the hall, and white light rose gradually.

“Damn it…” Diao Dezhu saw the white light on the flesh and instantly sprinted away, his speed at its peak.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian, now an ordinary man, stood beside Sun Mengru, his face equally shocked.

“Not… not dead yet?” Zheng Xin whispered fearfully, staring at Master of the Heavens’ flesh.

“Damn it, didn’t even die after being devoured by the Soul-Eating Silkworm!” Hearing Zheng Xin’s words, others gathered around Luo Tian, leading him back under the Yin-Yang Fish.

“Impossible!” Sun Mengru’s face was grim, then she firmly said, trusting the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s abilities fully.

“Done… done… this is over!” Their hearts felt despair, eyes on Master of the Heavens’ flesh regaining its power.

“Wait… this light looks sacred, not evil like before!” Luo Tian said softly, his voice filled with confusion as he furrowed his brows at the flesh.

Though Luo Tian was now an ordinary man, his eyes and spiritual awareness remained sharp enough to sense that Master of the Heavens’ flesh no longer bore hostility toward them.

The hum echoed, white light flickered, and a pale figure emerged from Master of the Heavens’ flesh. The apparition was an old man in white robes.

Though it was a ghostly form, the aura it radiated was solemn and imposing. Luo Tian, now an ordinary man, felt immense pressure from the old man’s apparition.

“Did it succeed?” The old man hovered above Master of the Heavens’ flesh, his face resembling 90% of the flesh.

“You… you are the true Master of the Heavens?” Diao Dezhu stammered, gazing at the pale apparition.

“You could say that… or not,” the old man said with a sigh, scanning Luo Tian and others before his gaze fell on Ruhongyu sitting behind them. His face softened slightly.

“My backdoor plan, set long ago, has finally taken effect!” The old man’s apparition nodded and bowed to Luo Tian and others.

“Thank you all for helping my son Ruhongyu break the Six Yin Seals!” The old man’s apparition spoke, his voice calm but filled with gratitude.

“Great Master of the Heavens! I didn’t mean to, please don’t be angry! That move was just for show, and spitting on you earlier was Xu Liyi’s idea. Please don’t take it personally!” Before the old man could speak further, Diao Dezhu’s voice echoed through the hall, his tone laced with tears.

Hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Master of the Heavens first blinked in surprise. Then his apparition’s lips twitched—if he had a body, his forehead veins would’ve jumped.

Chapter 1601: Benevolent Intentions ()

“Damn it…” Hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Xu Liyi muttered under his breath and glanced at the old man’s apparition above the flesh. He chuckled nervously.

“Master of the Heavens, I was using a strategy just now. Do you believe me?” Xu Liyi addressed the old man’s apparition.

“Diao Dezhu, don’t blame everything on me! You just wanted to show off and ended up dragging me into it!” Xu Liyi shouted at Diao Dezhu.

“You two little bastards…” The old man’s apparition cursed, his gaze fixed on Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi.

“Master of the Heavens, don’t be angry! We were just trying to protect ourselves. You know how powerful you were back then. If we hadn’t provoked you to show a weakness, we wouldn’t have defeated the entity within your flesh!” Xu Liyi spoke loudly, his eyes pleading toward the old man’s apparition.

“Wait…” Xu Liyi suddenly seemed to realize something, his face darkening as he stared at Diao Dezhu.

“You damn coward! As soon as Master of the Heavens appeared, you lost your nerve and just let it out. Why didn’t you ask Master of the Heavens if he knew about this?!” Xu Liyi’s face turned completely grim, then he glanced at the old man’s expression and guessed the truth.

“Truly stupid teammates!” Not sensing any hostility from the old man’s apparition, Zheng Xin and others relaxed. Their faces showed mockery as they looked at Diao Dezhu with disdain.

“Uh…” Diao Dezhu, seeing the old man’s apparition’s expression shift completely, looked puzzled.

“Damn it…” Diao Dezhu chuckled nervously, gazing at the old man’s apparition whose face was now dark.

“Originally, I didn’t know. Only after the demon was destroyed could I appear…” The old man’s apparition gritted his teeth, even an Epoch Lord’s composure was shaken by the two.

“If I were alive, I’d have beaten you both to death!” The old man’s apparition glared at Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi.

“Uh…” Hearing the old man’s own admission, Diao Dezhu felt awkward and regretful. He was stunned by the apparition’s sudden appearance.

“Enough, I don’t have much time. No more nonsense!” The old man’s apparition sneered and addressed Luo Tian and others again.

“This time, my son escaped danger thanks to your help. Though my flesh has had its vitality drained, this old body can still be refined into a remarkable treasure! You may dispose of it as you wish, as my gratitude for your kindness!” The old man’s apparition spoke softly, a hint of amusement in his voice.

“Really giving it to us!” Hearing the old man’s words, Luo Tian and others felt joy. They hadn’t expected him to truly gift them this flesh.

“And that coffin, you can give it to us too. Do you know why I don’t have an Epoch Treasure? Because I devoted most of my energy to this coffin. That’s why I didn’t create my own Epoch Treasure!” The old man’s apparition continued.

“These things should be worth your冒险!” The old man spoke softly, and Luo Tian’s group nodded repeatedly.

“Master of the Heavens, you’re truly generous!” Diao Dezhu praised enthusiastically, gazing at the old man with admiration.

“But I have two small conditions you must agree to!” The old man glared at Diao Dezhu, then continued.

Hearing the old man’s words, Luo Tian and others furrowed their brows slightly but didn’t object. They wanted to hear what the old man’s conditions were.

“Don’t be nervous. This condition is very simple for you. It’s more like a request than a demand—no need to sacrifice anything!” The old man smiled, addressing Luo Tian and others.

“Respectfully, if it’s within our power, we will certainly help!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully. Though he had become an ordinary man, his composure remained undisturbed.

The old man was merely a ghostly form, but he had once been an unparalleled powerhouse. Luo Tian still showed his respect.

“My first condition is that my things must not be given to these two bastards!” The old man said with gritted teeth, pointing at Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi. Though he had been an ultimate power in life, he couldn’t help but hold a grudge against the two who had insulted him.

“…”

Hearing the old man’s words, Luo Tian and others nearly fell over. They hadn’t expected his first condition to be so simple.

“Master of the Heavens, we…” Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi’s faces were grim, their expressions of helplessness as they gazed at the old man’s apparition.

“Both of you shut up! This is the punishment you deserve!” Sun Keinian scolded them, happy to have two fewer people to share with.

“My second condition is that you must not tell Ruhongyu about what I’m going to do!” The old man spoke again, his gaze soft as he looked at Ruhongyu by their side.

“What?” Hearing the old man’s words, Luo Tian and others furrowed their brows slightly. They didn’t know what the old man was planning next.

“Before I died, I knew Ruhongyu had the Six Yin Seals. I just didn’t want him to bear too much burden!” The old man spoke, as if lost in memories.

“I found a solution after knowing Ruhongyu had the Six Yin Seals—blood exchange!” The old man smiled.

“By making his life force wither and then reshaping his meridians, he had to master medical arts. This was the step he had to take alone.”

“My role was to use my flesh as a temporary container for his blood. That’s why I sealed him and drained my own vitality to create this coffin, storing it in the White Bone Forest, waiting for his arrival!” The old man spoke, his voice always gentle.

“Now I understand!” Luo Tian murmured to himself, deeply moved.

“Paternal love is like a mountain!” Luo Tian finally understood the old man’s benevolent intentions, his face filled with admiration.

Epoch Lords are all beings who dominate the nine heavens and ten earths, but the old man had another identity—Ruhongyu’s father.

What stunned Luo Tian even more was the terror of the Six Yin Seals, which even an ultimate Epoch Lord couldn’t solve. He had spent his life searching for a solution, using his own flesh to hold Ruhongyu’s blood.

“Even after draining my vitality, my flesh remained incredibly powerful. That’s why I set up this Nine Dragons Surrounding the Pearl realm—first to keep my flesh active, second to seal it. Otherwise, over time, even my flesh might have been eroded by the years!” The old man spoke, his voice tinged with sorrow.

“Master, didn’t you know your flesh would孕育 a demon?” Luo Tian asked with confusion.

If the old man had followed his original plan, and Ruhongyu had come alone to the White Bone Forest without them, he would have surely died.

“This is a secret of fate!” The old man’s eyes glinted with amusement, but he didn’t answer.

“Damn it…” Hearing the old man’s words, Luo Tian and others felt a slight contempt for him.

“Enough! Time is up! I hope you’ll agree to my conditions—nothing will be lost for you!” The old man gazed deeply at Ruhongyu, then spoke to Luo Tian and others without explanation. He raised his hands, and the ghostly form moved rapidly.

A series of seals formed in the old man’s hands, imprinted onto his flesh. The once quiet flesh began to hum again.

“Disperse…” The old man spoke softly, and the pale apparition vanished into beams of light, merging into his flesh.

“Boom…” After the white light touched the flawless flesh, it exploded with a blood mist, floating in the hall.

A powerful pressure descended upon them, making their faces shift slightly as they protected Luo Tian. After all, he couldn’t endure any more turmoil now.

“Truly strong! This blood vitality, nurtured by an Epoch Lord’s flesh, is so powerful!” Sun Mengru spoke softly, sensing the blood vitality nurtured by an Epoch Lord’s flesh was no worse than her own.

“Hum…” The hum echoed, golden and powerful blood vitality formed a crimson dragon, as if refined by something. It lost its overwhelming pressure and flew toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Go…” Zheng Xin led Luo Tian and the injured Chen Zhanbiao away under the Yin-Yang Fish.

“Rustle…” The blood dragon broke through the Yin-Yang Fish’s barrier and instantly appeared before Ruhongyu, who was seated.

“Live well…” The old man’s voice echoed before the blood dragon collided with Ruhongyu, flowing into his body through every pore.

As the powerful blood vitality entered Ruhongyu’s body, Luo Tian and others stopped watching. The old man’s plan had succeeded.

They then turned their eyes to the remaining skeleton after the old man’s self-destruction.

A golden-hued skeleton, still in a seated position, with divine light flowing across it. Luo Tian and others wore expressions of joy.

“This skeleton, if refined into a treasure, would be extraordinary!” Sun Keinian’s face showed greed, his body instinctively rushing toward the skeleton.

“Get lost…” Before Sun Keinian could move, Zheng Xin and others who had been watching him closely kicked him back.

“This has nothing to do with you. It was Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao who risked their lives for it. It should belong to them!” Zheng Xin said with disdain.

“Exactly, let’s wait until Luo Tian recovers!” Xu Liyi and others nodded in agreement. Sun Mengru then collected the skeleton and the green ancient coffin.

Sun Mengru smiled, waved her hand, and collected the skeleton and coffin before standing beside Luo Tian.

“Alright, everyone rest. We’ll distribute these later!” Luo Tian smiled, now the priority was to recover their strength. After all, they still had to continue searching for the White Bone Bamboo. Their current state made it impossible to proceed—Luo Tian’s condition meant he would die if he continued.

“Hmph, I was just looking!” Sun Keinian muttered and joined Zheng Xin and others to surround Luo Tian. After all, the hall was full of dangers.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian and others rested briefly in the second level of the hall. Chen Zhanbiao recovered on the seventh day, full of life.

“Boring!” After staying for ten days, they felt bored. Luo Tian had only lost his cultivation but remained otherwise unchanged. After replenishing their vitality with pills, he looked normal.

“Boom…” On the twentieth day in the hall, Ruhongyu’s body finally showed changes. A radiant light spread from his form, and a terrifying aura emerged.

“Something’s happening?” They quickly surrounded Luo Tian to block the immense aura, their faces filled with anticipation as they watched Ruhongyu.

Two beams of light flashed, and Ruhongyu slowly opened his eyes. A green glow flickered in them.

“I’ve survived!” Ruhongyu spoke softly, standing up slowly. A series of cracks echoed from his body, and an invisible pressure radiated from him.

“Unfortunately, I still haven’t reached the Epoch Lord realm!” Ruhongyu spoke softly, his face once again showing that warm smile.

“Thank you all for your help!” Ruhongyu spoke softly, his gaze filled with gratitude toward Luo Tian and others. He could imagine the battles they had faced.

He had been captured by the old man’s flesh and couldn’t resist. Luo Tian and others had saved him, so they must have paid a heavy price. Especially seeing Luo Tian’s current state, Ruhongyu’s gratitude deepened.

“I owe all of you my life!” Ruhongyu bowed respectfully to Luo Tian and others.

“If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t have entered the White Bone Forest either. It was us who dragged you into this!” Luo Tian spoke softly in return.

“No, I know it was all part of my father’s plan. Everything was for me to break the Six Yin Seals!” Ruhongyu’s eyes carried a sigh, gazing at Luo Tian and others with regret.

“Plan?” Hearing Ruhongyu’s words, Luo Tian and others furrowed their brows slightly. They didn’t understand what Ruhongyu meant.

“My father is the Master of the Heavens. He could foresee many things. I think he foresaw we would enter this White Bone Hell!” Ruhongyu spoke softly, his eyes filled with regret.

“Damn it…” Hearing Ruhongyu’s words, Luo Tian cursed under his breath, his expression filled with frustration.

“We were even moved before, but your father did this to you without telling you. Now I know he knew everything!” Sun Keinian’s face showed dissatisfaction, his image of the old man shifted from a noble father to a scheming person.

“Master of the Heavens, truly…” But then Luo Tian and others turned shocked, stunned by the old man’s power. Even this event was foreseen.

“Maybe my father didn’t foresee that his arrangement would be placed in the second level!” Ruhongyu spoke softly.

“Terrifying!” Luo Tian murmured, though being schemed was uncomfortable, he had to enter the White Bone Forest.

“Maybe there really is a fate. I should visit Star Realm someday!” Luo Tian thought of another realm skilled in divination and scheming.

“Alright, let me rest for a few days. After that, we’ll enter the third level. I don’t know if there’s White Bone Bamboo here. We’ve been in this White Bone Forest for a while, but I don’t know what’s happening outside!” Luo Tian murmured.

“Hmm…” Ruhongyu nodded, his gaze filled with a hint of sorrow. Though the old man had schemed against Luo Tian and others, he felt some guilt but knew his father had done it for the best. He also wanted Luo Tian and others to have no hostility toward him.

And the old man had done so much for him, Ruhongyu knew he hadn’t lived a second life but had spent his entire life researching the Six Yin Seals, all for him.

“Don’t be sad,” Luo Tian murmured to himself, though it was just安慰 for Ruhongyu. After all, even an Epoch Lord who had dominated the heavens and earth would have a difficult time if his flesh was gone and he hadn’t lived another era. The chance of becoming an immortal was slim.

“No need to console me!” Ruhongyu shook his head gently. Luo Tian could imagine what he was thinking, and how could he not?

With Ruhongyu’s awakening, everyone returned to calm. In the following days, Luo Tian and Ruhongyu continuously discussed medical arts. He was very interested in Ruhongyu’s acupuncture, especially since the Eight Sealing Needles had played a crucial role in their battle against the demon.

Ruhongyu answered every question Luo Tian asked, patiently explaining each detail, and Luo Tian benefited greatly.

With only three days left until the month ended, Zheng Xin sneaked up to Ruhongyu’s side, gazing at the playful group.

“Ruhongyu, I’m not meddling, but I need to tell you something. During your awakening period, Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi were really over the top. They…” Zheng Xin whispered, recounting how Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi had spat on the old man’s flesh and recorded images.

Hearing Zheng Xin’s words, Ruhongyu’s face darkened, his forehead veins pulsing. He gazed at Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi.

Luo Tian smiled bitterly, rubbing his forehead in frustration. He knew Zheng Xin’s mouth would never stay shut.

“Huh… I feel a bit cold?” Diao Dezhu said with confusion, instinctively shivering. His eyes were puzzled.

“I feel it too!” Xu Liyi felt a layer of goosebumps, their eyes meeting before searching for the source of the chill.

“Damn it!” They then saw Ruhongyu standing with Zheng Xin and let out a curse.

“Ruhongyu, let me explain… I mean…” Xu Liyi shouted immediately but was cut off mid-sentence by several glints of light piercing his body. Xu Liyi froze instantly.

“Hum…” Diao Dezhu didn’t explain, but as soon as he sensed something was wrong, his body vanished into a purple flash.

But Diao Dezhu’s speed wasn’t enough. The silver light was faster, and since he had started too late, he was shot mid-air and fell down with a bitter smile.

Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi were frozen in place, their faces filled with regret. They had been careless after seeing Zheng Xin for a while, letting him take advantage.

“Karma!” Sun Keinian and others looked on with mockery, gazing at the frozen Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi.

Secrets were non-existent for Zheng Xin; anything he knew became common knowledge. In the past, whatever Zheng Xin discovered was known across the Tianyuan Continent by the next day.

“Thank you for saving me!” Ruhongyu smiled, walking toward Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi. His smile was still warm, but to them it felt chilling.

“Ruhongyu, I’ll explain! These two were really over the top. Trust me!” Zheng Xin grabbed a storage bag from Diao Dezhu’s waist and took out a crystal-like object.

Zheng Xin pressed a button, and the memory crystal glowed, displaying scenes on the hall—Diao Dezhu’s “photo” with Master of the Heavens’ flesh.

Chapter 1603: Acupuncture Practice ()

“Two of you, I’ve recently developed a technique to help people circulate their energy. Let me test it on you as a token of gratitude for saving my life!” Ruhongyu smiled, flicking four silver needles from his fingers. They glowed with a chilling light that made Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi tremble.

“Ugh…” Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi stood frozen, watching Ruhongyu approach. They let out sounds but couldn’t scream, their eyes filled with desperation.

“The process will be a little painful, but I’m sure your endurance can handle it!” Ruhongyu smiled and flicked two needles into their bodies.

“Ugh…” The needles pierced their bodies, causing Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi to feel as if a thousand ants were crawling over them. Their bodies broke out in goosebumps.

They couldn’t scream, only emitting “uh uh” sounds. Xu Liyi and Yan Jun’s faces twitched slightly as they looked at Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi, pity in their eyes.

“This pair is truly cursed!” Yan Jun spoke softly, gazing at Ruhongyu, who now seemed the most terrifying person to them. Even Chen Zhanbiao, normally fearless, shivered slightly.

“Pfft…” Before anyone reacted, Ruhongyu’s second needle struck them. A wave of coldness spread over Xu Liyi and Diao Dezhu, their bodies instantly covered in frost.

The entire hall seemed to lower its temperature with the coldness radiating from them.

The third needle struck, and the temperature gradually rose. But half of their bodies radiated intense heat while the other half was freezing cold, all while they endured the unbearable itching.

“Terrifying! I feel like this Ruhongyu is even more terrifying than Luo Tian!” Yan Jun and Wan Lingkong looked at the suffering pair, instantly elevating Ruhongyu to the most dangerous person they couldn’t offend.

“This must be the legendary cold and fire dual realms!” Zheng Xin’s lips twitched as he looked at Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi.

“Damn it!” Hearing Zheng Xin’s words, Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi cursed inwardly. They wished to peel Zheng Xin’s skin off for his mouth being so annoying.

“Endure it, three days is all!” Luo Tian smiled, watching Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi. He had long wanted to punish these bastards but hadn’t found the right opportunity. Ruhongyu’s acupuncture had given him a new way.

Luo Tian watched them, thinking for a moment before his eyes lit up with an idea. The more he looked at them, the happier he became.

These days, Luo Tian had discussed acupuncture with Ruhongyu extensively but only theoretically. These two were perfect live targets.

Luo Tian’s eyes brightened more, looking at Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyu before addressing Ruhongyu: “Ruhongyu, let me take these two. I’ll test my new acupuncture!”

“Ugh… ugh…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyu wept. They were already suffering immensely; now another person was going to test on them. How could they live?

“Those two must have been dogs in their past lives, destined to be dogged in this one!” Yan Jun said with sympathy, watching Luo Tian approach Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyu.

“What did you say?” Hearing Yan Jun’s mumble, Zheng Xin’s ears twitched and he looked at Yan Jun.

“Get lost…” Seeing Zheng Xin’s intense gaze, Yan Jun’s face turned pale instantly. He wished to slap himself for his mistake.

“Ruhongyu, it’s not that I’m causing trouble. Yan Jun just said Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi were dogs in their past lives, destined to be dogged. Do you know who he meant by ‘dog’?” Zheng Xin flew toward Ruhongyu, addressing him.

“What did you say?” Hearing Zheng Xin’s words, Ruhongyu didn’t get angry. But Sun Mengru did, her aura flaring as she glared at Yan Jun. Yan Jun’s words indirectly called Luo Tian a dog, implying he was “dogged.”

“Sister-in-law, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it!” Yan Jun trembled as he looked at Sun Mengru’s fiery eyes.

“Yan Jun, come here. Your cultivation has dropped so low you need practical training to improve!” Sun Mengru flew toward Yan Jun.

“Boom…” Not long after, Yan Jun was thrown to Luo Tian’s side with a bruised face and an expression of委屈.

“Kid, you just cursed me?” Luo Tian’s eyes glinted as he looked at Yan Jun. Yan Jun was more suitable for testing than Diao Dezhu and Xu Liyi, since he had only lost his cultivation.

“Big brother, I’m sorry! I really know I’m wrong!” Yan Jun, with a bruised face, begged Luo Tian.

“Don’t worry, trust me, nothing will happen!” Luo Tian smiled and took out a bag of needles, placing it before Yan Jun.

“Hum…” Yan Jun looked at the silver needles glowing with cold light, his face turning as if he had eaten something foul. He felt an inexplicable fear.

Though Yan Jun’s strength was formidable, his body was powerful, but Ruhongyu’s silver needles were specially crafted to pierce his flesh.

“Don’t move!” Luo Tian took out a needle and pierced Yan Jun’s arm.

“Ah…” Yan Jun’s scream echoed, but Luo Tian pulled his hand back, looking at the needle embedded half an inch into Yan Jun’s arm. His face showed a brief awkwardness.

“Yan Jun, don’t move! Look, you’ve missed!” Luo Tian’s face turned serious as he scolded Yan Jun.

“I…” Yan Jun’s handsome face twisted, his pain unbearable from the needle. But he dared not argue; he was truly afraid that if he said he hadn’t moved, Luo Tian would retaliate.

“Truly self-inflicted…” Sun Keinian’s face showed relief, as he had almost said the same thing.
