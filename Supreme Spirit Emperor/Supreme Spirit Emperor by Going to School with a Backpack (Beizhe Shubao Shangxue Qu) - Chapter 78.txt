“Let me find you lots of glowing gems!”

“Good!” Luotian and Long Baobao eventually reached an agreement under Luotian’s various temptations.

Seeing Long Baobao agree, Jiang Nanxuan’s face lit up with joy. His erudition had gradually guessed Long Baobao’s true race. If his suspicions were correct, the chance of solving Meng Yao’s problem would be much greater.

Under Jiang Nanxuan’s expectant gaze, Long Baobao slowly extended his tender little hand. His eyes tightly shut, his body trembling uncontrollably.

Luotian’s gaze softened as he retrieved an object resembling a needle. Though it looked like a pin, it was actually an advanced artifact of the Xuan grade. Long Baobao’s terrifying flesh was no easy task to pierce.

Grasping Long Baobao’s finger, Luotian’s needle-like artifact pierced into his hand.

“Ah… It hurts…” Long Baobao cried out, his legs kicking wildly. The stone table shattered instantly under his kicks. Fortunately, Jiang Nanxuan swiftly retrieved the previous vial of blood essence.

“Roar…” A single drop of blood fell from Long Baobao’s finger. At the moment the blood appeared, a powerful aura radiated from it, causing the parrot and green snake to cower on the ground.

A golden glow flickered from within the blood. Jiang Nanxuan’s face brimmed with excitement as he swiftly collected the drop of blood.

“Ouch, it hurts so much!” Long Baobao’s eyes glistened with tears. He sucked on his finger, gazing at Luotian with a pitiful expression.

“Alright, alright,” Luotian said gently, retrieving a pill and handing it to Long Baobao. He also gave him the storage bag containing the gems he had purchased in Lishui City.

Upon seeing the familiar storage bag, Long Baobao instantly recovered, his face displaying a satisfied expression. He fastened the bags to his waist, reasoning that carrying them himself was safer than returning to the seal.

Luotian observed Long Baobao, his gaze contemplative. He could clearly sense the pressure and vitality contained within the drop of blood, as if gazing upon a treasure trove.

“Boy… come here once… there’s something…” Just as Luotian observed Long Baobao, Leng Hongcai’s voice echoed in Luotian, Leng Qiuchan, and Zheng Xin’s ears.

Chapter 382: Siege ()

Chapter 382: Siege

The Yuling Sect’s Grand Hall.

Leng Hongcai sat at the head of the table, with elders seated to his sides. Their gazes carried a hint of solemnity. Behind them stood over a dozen pale-faced youths, tension thick in the air.

Luotian, Leng Qiuchan, and Zheng Xin stepped into the hall. Instantly, a dozen gloomy stares fell upon Luotian as if trying to pierce him.

“Boy, are you Luotian?” An elderly man with white hair sat near Leng Hongcai. His gaze was cold as he asked.

Luotian furrowed his brow, noting the elder’s proximity to Leng Hongcai. He deduced the man held a high position in Yuling Sect. Behind him stood Chen Yuhe, confirming his suspicions.

“Indeed, I am Luotian!” Sensing the hostile gazes around him, Luotian spoke calmly and confidently.

“Hmph… arrogant… You’ve only just joined the sect but already demand each disciple’s blood. Do you know your crime?” The elder sneered, loudly accusing Luotian.

As the elder’s words faded, the thirteen elders’ auras coalesced into one, pressing heavily against Luotian.

“Crack…” Luotian’s body instantly dropped a notch, his legs sinking into the ground. He met their gazes with mockery.

“I am unaware,” Luotian said firmly, as if sensing no pressure. His body trembled slightly, emitting an invisible ripple.

“Hmph?” The hall’s occupants narrowed their eyes in surprise.

They were all true Xuanling-grade masters. Yet, their combined auras failed to subdue a mere bone-fragmenting peak.

Luotian’s gaze swept over the elder’s back, noting some youths blushing with shame while others watched him with schadenfreude. He memorized the latter’s faces silently.

Leng Hongcai smiled slightly: “You’ve arrived? Come here.”

As Leng Hongcai’s words ended, Luotian walked calmly to his side with Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin.

Leng Hongcai’s expression turned satisfied. He had refrained from aiding Luotian to let these elders view him favorably. Though he’d heard of Luotian’s actions, he felt it wasn’t enough to secure his position as Sect Leader.

“Since everyone is here, let’s discuss the matter,” Leng Hongcai said, handing Luotian a jade slip.

Luotian took it without hesitation. His expression darkened upon reading the message:

“Tianshi Sect has emerged. Duan Xingchen was captured. Their base is in Taian Mountains…”

“Three sects have long maintained good relations. Duan Xingchen was captured after we left. Taian Mountains are near our sect, and Tianshi Sect has appeared in the Kunlun Mountains of our eastern domain. This matter cannot be ignored, so I’ve consulted with the elders to assign you as leader for rescuing Duan Xingchen.” Leng Hongcai’s face bore solemnity, his gaze on Luotian awaiting an answer.

“As the Sect Leader of Yuling, I bear this responsibility,” Luotian said with a hint of killing intent.

“Rest assured, we have reliable information: the highest-ranked individual in their base is only bone-fragmenting peak. With your current strength, you should manage it,” Leng Hongcai said, nodding in approval.

After Luotian agreed so readily, the elders’ grim faces eased slightly.

Luotian nodded, inquiring about details before leading the pale-faced youths out.

As Luotian and the disciples exited, the elders also rose to depart.

…

“Yang Huanyu. I hope this mission finds you. I still haven’t repaid the debt,” Luotian’s face bore a hint of killing intent, recalling Yang Huanyu’s image.

Leng Qiuchan and the others followed Luotian, sensing his shifting aura. Leng Qiuchan’s face showed confusion.

The group soon reached Yuling Sect’s plaza, where a thousand disciples stood in formation, awaiting Luotian.

When Luotian’s group appeared, the thousand disciples blinked in confusion, their gazes settling on him.

“Who is this youth? Why stands he before Leng’s sister and Dongbo?”
“He must be Luotian, the Sect Leader personally appointed!”
“Is he that genius from the Northern Domain?” The crowd murmured, scrutinizing Luotian.
“Nothing special, really!”
“Exactly! What’s his talent? If we lose our sect members, I’ll be the first to hold him accountable!” They chattered.

“Roar…” A dragon’s cry echoed, silencing the chaos.

A flying dragon obscured the sky, its wings stirring a gale before landing on the ground.

“Let’s go!” Luotian spoke softly, leaping onto the dragon’s back.

Seeing him ascend, Leng Qiuchan, Zheng Xin, and Dongbo Yongsi also jumped onto the beast. The thousand disciples followed suit, discussing Luotian.

Dongbo Yongsi and others were pulled into the crowd, engaging in conversation. For a moment, Luotian, Zheng Xin, and Leng Qiuchan felt like lone figures.

“Those people are so rude! They didn’t even include us!” Zheng Xin’s eyes dimmed as he returned.

He’d been thrilled by the thousand disciples’ chatter, but now, wherever he went, they avoided him like a plague.

Seeing Zheng Xin’s disappointment, Luotian and Leng Qiuchan smiled.

“Zheng Xin’s so pitiful!” Long Baobao stood by Luotian, fiddling with gems. To him, Zheng Xin was like a child left out of play.

Hearing Long Baobao’s words, Zheng Xin’s eyes brightened: “Long Baobao, would you like me to tell a story?”

Chapter 383: Arrival at Taian Mountains ()

Chapter 383: Arrival at Taian Mountains

Three days later, the dragon soared across the sky, finally reaching Taian Mountains.

At three thousand feet high, Luotian’s spiritual sense spread outward. His spiritual awareness had reached the Xuanling initial stage, equivalent to the Lianxi realm. Below, everything was clear to him.

His spiritual sense revealed a towering palace deep within the mountains. Though surrounded by dense forest, its perimeter was nearly lifeless—plants had lost all vitality.

“Roar…” The dragon let out a low growl, signaling their arrival. It descended slowly.

The palace in Taian Mountains was shrouded in darkness. Flickering lights illuminated hundreds of black-cloaked figures with crescent moon emblems, bowing respectfully toward a young figure on a platform.

The youth’s gaze was cold as he looked at the bound youth beside him, smirking: “Star-body talent. Indeed formidable. I’ve used the corpse-control incantation, yet still couldn’t subdue you!”

“Dare to control me? You’re unworthy!” The bound youth spoke weakly, yet his voice carried resolve.

“Worthiness isn’t your call to make. Rest assured, I have many methods! Let’s see if your will is strong enough!” The youth’s face was cold, his lips curling.

“Yang Huanyu!” Luotian stood on the descending dragon, his spiritual sense imprinting every detail of the palace. He recognized the youth on the platform as Yang Huanyu.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve also been transported to the Eastern Domain! Then let’s settle old and new scores together!” Luotian’s lips curled slightly as he leapt from the dragon.

“Is it Luotian? He jumped down!” The dragon’s back crowd gasped.

Though the dragon had descended to two thousand feet, this height was still challenging for most bone-fragmenting peak disciples. Luotian’s ears caught the wind, his smile widening as he dove like a hawk seeking prey.

“Buzz…” As if sensing his joy, the palace’s air shimmered with a formation barrier. A faint scent of blood emanated from it.

“Just a third-grade formation?” Luotian’s lips curled in disdain. His Rip Sky Spear materialized, its power channeled into it.

“Buzz!” The spear’s tip pointed at the barrier, sparks flying from its edge.

“One thousand five hundred feet… one thousand feet…”

In an instant, Luotian slammed his spear into the crimson barrier.

“Crack…” The third-grade formation shattered like paper, momentarily halting Luotian’s descent.

Luotian’s form passed through the barrier, his legs sinking into the ground. His bone-fragmenting peak aura radiated outward as he spoke coldly, his voice echoing through the hall:

“Yang Huanyu! Long time no see!” His words seemed like a greeting to an old friend, yet the chill and unhidden killing intent were unmistakable.

“Enemy attack!” The palace’s occupants erupted in chaos. Black-cloaked Tianshi Sect disciples showed initial panic but, upon seeing Yang Huanyu, calmed.

“Luotian? I didn’t expect you to come yourself!” Yang Huanyu’s initial surprise turned into a smirk.

The bound Duan Xingchen, hearing Luotian’s name, blinked with renewed hope.

“Sect Leader! What should we do? It seems the three sects have discovered our base. Should we retreat?” A bone-fragmenting peak elder behind Yang Huanyu asked respectfully.

“No need. Just a thousand people. They can’t harm us,” Yang Huanyu’s eyes gleamed with battlelust, striding toward the palace entrance.

Seeing Yang Huanyu leave, the elder followed closely. The remaining Tianshi Sect disciples trailed after them.

“Roar…” The dragon roared, descending slowly to set the group down. It stood aside, trembling as it gazed at Long Baobao—a tiny figure among a thousand. If not for orders, the dragon would have flown far away. That child terrified it more than the approaching black-cloaked figures.

Yet, no one noticed Long Baobao’s presence; he was too small among a thousand.

Luotian stood at the forefront, his gaze fixed on Yang Huanyu’s front. His lips curled with coldness.

Hundreds of Tianshi Sect masters emerged from the palace, their faces icy as they stared at Yuling Sect’s disciples.

Though only hundreds, the sight of them made a thousand Yuling Sect disciples tremble. The sheer presence felt like standing amidst a sea of corpses.

“Hah… Luotian, it’s been a while. Last time you were lucky; this time, you’ve come yourself. Do you think reaching bone-fragmenting peak makes you capable of defeating me?” Yang Huanyu stood at the front, his lips curling in mockery.

“Tianshi Sect disciples all deserve death!” Luotian wasted no words, his Rip Sky Spear raised in a golden snake dance. His steps moved like lightning, employing the封天步 (Fengtian Step) with four steps now.

In a blink, Luotian appeared before Yang Huanyu, his five-colored fists bearing terrifying pressure.

Yang Huanyu’s lips curled with cruelty as he summoned gray qi, his fists clenched. No fear in his gaze as he met Luotian’s fist.

“Crash…” The thunderous sound echoed, like two hammers colliding. It left people’s ears ringing.

Luotian withdrew instantly, his face grim. His initial strike had used all his strength, yet Yang Huanyu, a bone-fragmenting late-stage master, had withstood it. This made Luotian reassess Yang Huanyu.

“Attribute suppression?” Luotian’s mind reeled, recalling their clash.

Chapter 384: Battle with Yang Huanyu ()

Chapter 384: Battle with Yang Huanyu

As Luotian pondered, the Tianshi Sect’s elder behind Yang Huanyu showed disbelief. He gazed at Luotian, then at Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu needed no introduction; as the head of Tianshi Sect’s Eastern Domain base, the elder knew his details. Yet he hadn’t expected anyone to match Yang Huanyu’s punch and remain even.

“Kill!” Luotian gripped his spear again, his killing intent unhidden as he dashed toward Yang Huanyu.

“Kill!” Leng Qiuchan’s eyes turned icy, his sword drawn as he attacked the crowd.

“Though I don’t wish to kill, you Tianshi Sect scum must die. You’ve committed too many crimes…” Zheng Xin muttered, his twin hammers mercilessly striking the crowd.

“Kill!” Long Baobao’s small face turned serious, his legs leaving streaks as he charged into the crowd.

Dongbo Yongsi led the thousand disciples behind, attacking Tianshi Sect’s forces. Though they wished to stay out of it, Tianshi Sect must be eradicated—eternal truth. They could quarrel within their sects, but against Tianshi Sect, unity was essential.

The battle reignited. This was Luotian’s second clash with Tianshi Sect, though smaller than the previous skirmish of tens of thousands.

Explosions echoed through Taian Mountains as Luotian wielded his spear, repeatedly attacking. Yang Huanyu deftly parried each strike.

Luotian’s gaze narrowed, his eyes deep as he watched Yang Huanyu standing proudly. He felt each attack’s power, enough to defeat any bone-fragmenting late-stage master.

Yet Yang Huanyu’s destruction attribute suppressed his five-element attributes, leaving Luotian astounded.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve grown so much in such a short time. But it seems useless,” Yang Huanyu’s lips curled with amusement, his greedy gaze on Luotian.

“Hmph!” Luotian sneered, his hands moving swiftly as the Five-Element Birth Human Seal materialized in the sky.

Now a bone-fragmenting peak, Luotian’s Five-Element Birth Human Seal had doubled in power. It was nearly at the level of a terrestrial-grade technique.

The “Military” seal, radiating terrifying pressure, smashed toward Yang Huanyu.

“Can’t you come up with something fresh?” Yang Huanyu’s lips curled in disdain, his hands forming seals.

“Tongming Slash!” Yang Huanyu roared, a gray sword clashing with the Human Seal. The two techniques exploded into the air.

“Troublesome! Elder Yang, hold him back for a while—I’ll finish these thousand disciples at once!” Yang Huanyu called to his rear, retreating.

As Yang Huanyu’s words faded, the elder behind him instantly blocked Luotian’s path.

“Still using that formation? I’m not the same as before! Qiuchan, Zheng Xin, Long Baobao, help me hold this old man!” Luotian sneered, yet his mind was tense. He didn’t want to endure Yang Huanyu’s previous formation again.

Leng Qiuchan, hearing Luotian’s call, pierced a Tianshi Sect disciple’s throat with his sword. He stepped forward to Luotian’s side.

Zheng Xin laughed, smashing a disciple with his hammer. His feet moved swiftly to Luotian’s front.

“Bone-fragmenting peak? Today I’ll test you!” Leng Qiuchan lightly swung his sword, blood droplets falling. His gaze was cold as he faced the elder.

“I’ll crush you!” Long Baobao shouted, his clumsy form plummeting from the sky toward the elder.

“Crash…” Long Baobao’s body fell like a meteor, creating a deep pit.

“Oops… I missed!” Long Baobao emerged from the hole, scratching his head, walking toward Luotian.

The group stared in disbelief at Long Baobao, even Zheng Xin, usually talkative, speechless.

“Hold him back! I’ll kill that person; they hold a special status in Tianshi Sect!” Luotian sneered, dashing toward Yang Huanyu.

“Die!” The elder’s face twisted with fury, attempting to block Luotian. But before he moved, a sword, a hammer, and a meaty fist appeared before him.

Luotian ignored the three’s battle. Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin, both bone-fragmenting mid-stage, were strong enough to rival late-stage. With the extraordinary Long Baobao, Luotian had no fear for their safety.

Yet as he ran through the crowd, Luotian felt like a magnet, constantly blocked by Tianshi Sect disciples. Some even abandoned their opponents to intercept him.

Seeing this, Luotian’s brow furrowed. Spotting Yang Huanyu ahead, urgency gripped his heart. He quickly moved his hands.

The Flame Dragon Hand shot out, exploding behind the Tianshi Sect crowd.

“Fen Tian, Li Fire Formation!” Luotian slammed his hands on the ground. A sea of fire engulfed the Tianshi Sect’s rear, surrounding dozens of disciples.

Before Luotian, a vacuum formed from the fire. Now a bone-fragmenting peak, his Fen Tian Li Fire Formation could instantly kill those at the cultivation stage. Even bone-fragmenting early-stage masters would barely survive.

Luotian didn’t hesitate, activating the Fengtian Step to appear within a hundred feet of Yang Huanyu. His Rip Sky Spear pierced forward.

A hundred feet was but a breath for Luotian—nearly instantaneous.

Yang Huanyu, running, felt the spear’s hum and its ability to tear everything apart. He paused, his hand gripping a gray spear, wrapping it in gray qi to block Luotian’s attack.

“Fast!” Yang Huanyu inwardly marveled, seeing the fire sea and struggling Tianshi Sect disciples. His face darkened.

These five hundred were nearly half of Tianshi Sect’s strength in Kunlun Mountains. Kunlun was a closed area; transmission arrays were all within sects. Even Tianshi Sect found it hard to enter, making their Eastern Domain presence minimal.

“Luotian, you must die!” Yang Huanyu’s face twisted with ferocity. He decided no longer to flee but fight Luotian directly!

Chapter 385: Escape ()

Chapter 385: Escape

“Golden Snake Dance!” Luotian, seeing Yang Huanyu no longer flee, smiled. The Five-Element Birth Human Seal unleashed immediately, striking Yang Huanyu.

“Tongming Slash…” The gray sword clashed with the snake, sending Luotian’s hand numb.

“Then I’ll waste some effort to finish you!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes gleamed with fierce battlelust, clashing directly with Luotian.

Gray qi enveloped Yang Huanyu’s body, a destructive aura forming, pressing toward Luotian.

Luotian’s face darkened; he felt his qi flow sluggish, as if congealed.

In that moment of distraction, Yang Huanyu’s spear transformed into a gray dragon, smashing toward Luotian.

“Zhen Hun Ding!” Luotian was no longer the boy who couldn’t lift Zhen Hun Ding. His bone-fragmenting peak strength was far greater than normal, allowing him to lift the massive cauldron.

A ten-foot-high Zhen Hun Ding was held high by Luotian, his arms bulging as he raised it.

“Go…” Luotian roared, the cauldron smashing the gray dragon.

The Zhen Hun Ding didn’t stop; it collided with Yang Huanyu after scattering the dragon.

At the cauldron’s appearance, the battlefield was gripped by a powerful pressure. Those near Luotian and Yang Huanyu stared in awe at the bronze cauldron, their faces stunned.

“Hmph… Even a terrestrial-grade technique is wasted in your hands!” Yang Huanyu sneered, his body leaving a residual image. His presence vanished into the void.

“Boom…” The Zhen Hun Ding smashed through countless ancient trees, finally stopping after hitting a mountain hundreds of feet away. A deep hole formed in the mountain, with the cauldron embedded within.

Luotian ignored Yang Huanyu’s whereabouts, instantly appearing beside the cauldron to retrieve it. He knew Zhen Hun Ding’s power was immense; that strike would have killed Yang Huanyu had it landed. Yet the cauldron’s speed was limited, and Yang Huanyu’s speed was too fast.

This cauldron wasn’t a technique; it couldn’t be controlled by spiritual sense or redirected. It hadn’t been mastered yet, so it wouldn’t obey him.

“Tongming Blood Spear!” A cold voice echoed behind Luotian, instantly locking him.

“Buzz…” A massive spear, like a dominator of the world, swept toward Luotian.

“Sect Leader’s might!” Some Tianshi Sect disciples gazed at the gray spear in the sky, their faces filled with admiration.

“Finally, the Sect Leader used a terrestrial-grade technique! That boy is doomed!” Tianshi Sect disciples’ eyes glowed with excitement. Though they faced a thousand Yuling Sect disciples, they remained fearless, matching them evenly.

The thunderous explosion collapsed a large part of the mountain and Luotian’s form vanished into the void.

Dust filled the air, Yang Huanyu’s technique explosion overwhelming the battlefield.

Yang Huanyu sighed: “Regretfully, he didn’t die.”

“Didn’t die?” Tianshi Sect disciples’ faces showed shock. They hadn’t expected even a terrestrial-grade technique to fail against Luotian.

“Roar…” As Tianshi Sect disciples thought Luotian would at least be injured, a fire dragon burst from the dust, smashing toward Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu’s gaze narrowed; he knew this Flame Dragon Hand was a yellow-grade technique. But once detonated, its subsequent techniques were nearly terrestrial-grade.

“Swoosh…” Yang Huanyu vanished, sprinting to avoid the technique he could easily crush.

“Can’t escape! You’ll take it!” Luotian’s cold voice echoed from the dust. His spiritual sense guided the Flame Dragon Hand to follow Yang Huanyu relentlessly.

“Crash…” Yang Huanyu paused slightly, and the Flame Dragon Hand exploded on his body.

“Fen Tian, Li Fire Formation!” Luotian’s lips curled into a perfect arc. He slammed his hands on the ground, summoning the Human Seal and Soul Seal into the sky.

“Technique fusion: Huangji Seal, Luotian’s strongest technique!” Now a bone-fragmenting peak, the yellow-grade seal had ascended. It could rival a terrestrial-grade mid-tier technique, nearly reaching high-tier.

A terrifying seal formed in the sky, pressing down on all combatants. They paused, fear in their eyes as they gazed at the spiritual energy seal.

“Luotian! Unexpectedly, his full power is so terrifying!” Yuling Sect disciples’ faces glowed with fervor, watching Luotian.

Dongbo Yongsi and Chen Yuhe’s faces bore bitter smiles. They hadn’t expected Luotian to be this strong, making them feel deep inferiority before him.

Under the crowd’s awe, the Huangji Seal formed in the sky, its pressure making people tremble.

“Die!” Luotian smiled, the golden seal radiating a sun-like light, its imperial pressure smashing into the fire sea.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed through the mountains, the fire sea colliding with the Huangji Seal. It surged ten feet high, making everyone feel a scorching heat.

The closest Tianshi Sect disciples were caught in the fire, crying out.

“Ah…” The elder who had fought Long Baobao’s group showed a cruel face, yelling.

Chapter 386: Aurora Wings ()

Chapter 386: Aurora Wings

All eyes trembled at the surging fire sea. Tianshi Sect disciples, seeing it, looked ashen. They couldn’t fathom how Yang Huanyu could survive two terrestrial-grade techniques, even if he was their invincible leader.

“Luotian!” Yuling Sect disciples gazed at him with fervor, seeing him as a war god. He was unstoppable now, no longer the one who had doubted him.

Even Dongbo Yongsi felt the gap between himself and Luotian, realizing their disparity.

“Still alive?” Luotian’s brow furrowed as he probed the fire sea with his spiritual sense.

Inside, he felt a massive pit created by the Huangji Seal. Yang Huanyu stood there, breathing heavily, his body shrouded in gray qi. Though no longer calm, blood trickled from his lips, a crescent moon tattoo on his back.

Yang Huanyu’s eyes also showed shock. He hadn’t expected Luotian to grow so much in months. Though he was a bone-fragmenting late-stage master, against an average bone-fragmenting peak, his attribute suppression would be nearly equal.

If not for his special methods, he’d already be dead. His gaze bore determination; he knew now he couldn’t defeat Luotian unless he had more time to craft his previous formation or reached bone-fragmenting peak.

A soul-restraining pearl appeared in Yang Huanyu’s hand. Without hesitation, he smashed it, releasing a violent blood qi that dimmed the fire.

“Suck…” Yang Huanyu inhaled the blood qi, his face reddening slightly.

Luotian sensed Yang Huanyu’s actions and grimaced. He knew what the blood qi was—any ordinary warrior would go mad, entering a killing frenzy if mishandled.

Yet Yang Huanyu showed no issues, his injuries even healing slightly. This astonished Luotian.

“Attribute?” Luotian’s eyes widened, marveling at destruction attribute’s power. It could suppress even the bloody qi. Tianshi Sect was the pinnacle of evil cultivation; with enough blood, Yang Huanyu’s strength would reach terrifying levels.

“He must be captured; otherwise, it’ll cause future problems!” Luotian knew Tianshi Sect had long coveted his memory of the Epoch Book, making them inevitable enemies.

As Luotian pondered, the fire sea was annihilated by Yang Huanyu’s destruction attribute, revealing his disheveled form.

“Damn… He still lives!” Zheng Xin cursed, stunned.

The Yuling Sect disciples also showed disbelief, gazing at Yang Huanyu standing there.
