"Crack..." Like an ocean of golden runes, they gradually sank into the altar below. The blue altar emitted a series of brittle cracking sounds, and a fissure slowly appeared on its surface, spreading outward.

"Roar..." A deep roar echoed in people's ears, a wild and restless aura emerging from the crack, causing Sha Cangmang and others to tremble slightly.

Pressure, terrifying pressure instantly enveloped everyone. Even Sun Mingtian and Luo Tian in the sky were suppressed by this terrifying pressure, standing on the sky with wobbles.

"Crash..." Finally, on the ground, all Supreme Stage masters except Nan Gong Yuqing and Sha Cangmang, four Nine Sources Stage Tian Zun, fell to the ground.

"In the river of冥河 (Minghe), the beast with eight eyes widened, its face showing fear.

The beast had been raised in the river since childhood by the Lord of the冥域 (Mingyu), and for many years, it had sensed a powerful presence sealed beneath the altar.

"Who dares to open the altar?!" The beast roared, its body rapidly sinking into the riverbed, sealing all its aura.

"Damn it! What did this guy release?!" Tu Hongfei and others showed great fear, cursing while lying on the ground.

"Haha! None of you will escape today! This altar sealed my clan's sacred beast!" Sun Xinghuo laughed wildly, his eyes filled with reverence as he knelt before the crack in the altar.

"Divine clan's sacred beast?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, unaware that the divine clan had ever worshipped a sacred beast.

Sun Mingtian's face also showed a sinister expression. His mission here was to release the sacred beast sealed in the Sacred Beast Continent and bring it back to the divine clan.

"Boom!" Sun Mingtian凝聚 two supreme forces into two large hands, forcefully inserting them into the crack that had split open a zhang wide.

"Open!" Sun Mingtian roared, the thunderous sound echoing. Under his power, the already slowly cracking fissure suddenly accelerated its speed, blue stone fragments flying everywhere.

A terrifying energy vortex instantly formed above the altar, becoming a terrible storm. From the crack below the supreme altar, flashes of light shot out, painfully piercing people's eyes.

Another roar echoed as a golden phantom flew out from beneath the altar. Due to the blinding light, even Luo Tian couldn't clearly see what kind of creature was in the light screen.

"Who awakened me?!" A dignified voice echoed in people's ears, causing a slight tremor in their hearts.

"It is the divine clan. Your devoted servant has released you!" Sun Mingtian, now on the ground with Sun Xinghuo and others, knelt before the light screen, his face filled with devotion.

"Hmph... disturbing my dream. I just wanted to sleep, but you interrupted me!" A bold voice echoed from the light screen, causing Sun Mingtian's group to break out in cold sweat.

"Ah? There's someone still daring to fly in front of my presence?" It seemed to sense Luo Tian's existence, the light screen emitted a series of angry voices. A terrifying pressure instantly crushed toward Luo Tian.

"Divine beast, this man is our clan's enemy. Please destroy this desecrating human!" Sun Mingtian's face showed a hint of smile, looking at Luo Tian with a mocking tone.

Luo Tian heard the dignified voice and furrowed his brows. Then, terrifying pressure instantly invaded Luo Tian's body, causing him to rapidly descend.

Chapter 841: You Keep Pretending ()

On the Sacred Beast Continent, Luo Tian's body continuously descended, his face showing surprise. His gaze fell upon the phantom in the light screen, feeling the powerful aura it emitted. Even Luo Tian was slightly startled, especially by the overwhelming pressure that made him feel an irresistible sense.

"So powerful. Even more terrifying than the elders in Tiger Fortress!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, landing on the ground.

"Please, divine beast, destroy this desecrating human!" Sun Mingtian again spoke to the light screen with devotion.

"Ah... well, this ant-like Supreme Stage being, I could blow it to death with one breath. Today I just came out to bask in the sun, and I don't want to kill anyone. Go away!" The light screen emitted an impatient voice, causing Sun Mingtian's group to look uneasy.

"Damn it! I finally released you, but you don't do any work!" Sun Mingtian's group inwardly cursed, but dared not show it on their faces. They only bowed respectfully to the light screen again.

"Divine beast, this man killed our clan's people. His crime deserves death. I beg you to kill him in the name of your worship by our clan for generations." Sun Mingtian's face showed reluctance, again pleading.

A fluctuation spread out. A snow-white phoenix flew out from the light screen, its vast white wings emitting a soft glow, covering the sky and appearing extremely beautiful.

"This is the Snow Phoenix. Legends say that when it reaches its peak, it can become a real phoenix, comparable to the pinnacle of sages. I never thought such a legendary creature actually exists!" Sha Cangmang and others spoke, their faces showing disbelief.

Xuanwu's old tortoise widened its eyes, also showing shock. Its eyes flashed with intense light. As the guardian beast of Xuanwu Sect, it deeply understood sacred beasts and knew that Snow Phoenix truly existed in the world.

"This is definitely a Snow Phoenix, and its strength is very powerful. But why does it feel strange to me?" Xuanwu muttered, looking at the snow-white phoenix emitting a soft glow in the sky, its brows slightly furrowed.

Hearing Xuanwu's words, Luo Tian felt puzzled. For some reason, he also felt strange when seeing the Snow Phoenix.

"Are you questioning my words?" The pure white phoenix stood proudly in the sky, looking at Sun Mingtian. Its pressure gathered again, showing no regard for those who had released it, and crushed against Sun Mingtian's group.

"I said I don't want to kill anyone today. Didn't you hear me? Don't make me repeat it again!" The Snow Phoenix coldly spoke, its voice still carrying authority.

"Yes, yes, yes!" Cold sweat dripped from Sun Mingtian's face. His eyes showed respect as he quickly spoke.

"Hmph, you know well enough. That kid, take your people and leave!" The Snow Phoenix ignored Sun Mingtian and gave a low call to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian instantly activated his Purple Extreme Eye, his purple eyes gazing at the massive Snow Phoenix emitting a soft white light.

"I told you to leave, why haven't you left yet? I said I'm in a good mood today and don't want to kill you. What are you looking at? Don't you fear I'll kill you?" Seeing Luo Tian's eyes filled with purple, the Snow Phoenix's voice showed a hint of anxiety.

"What are you looking at?"

"I not only look at you, I also want to fight you!" Luo Tian's face showed a smile. He forcefully suppressed the pressure from the Snow Phoenix and jumped toward it in the sky.

"Die!" Seeing Luo Tian's actions, Sun Mingtian and his group felt delighted. They never expected Luo Tian to seek death by attacking the Snow Phoenix.

Sun Mingtian had already known that the Snow Phoenix didn't want to kill Luo Tian, so today Luo Tian's life was untouchable.

But now, the Snow Phoenix said to let Luo Tian go, but Luo Tian actively attacked it. This was unbearable for any great power, especially the proud Feng clan.

"Since you're seeking death, don't blame me for being unkind!" Seeing Luo Tian's black aura rushing toward him, the Snow Phoenix's凤 eyes (feng eyes) showed a hint of panic but still carried authority.

"Buzz..." As the Snow Phoenix's words fell, its massive wings slowly flapped in the sky. Terrifying winds turned into stormy whirlwinds, carrying cold and sharp ice blades toward Luo Tian.

With one flap of its wings, the Snow Phoenix created countless cracks in the sky. Black whirlpools turned into black holes and flew into the storm, making its power even more formidable.

"Powerful! The Snow Phoenix's casual attack is so powerful. Legends say that before it was sealed, the Snow Phoenix had the strength of a sage's initial stage. Although sealed, its cultivation didn't decrease but increased significantly. Our clan's sage中期 (sage medium) ancestor wasn't as strong as the Snow Phoenix, was he?" A disciple of the divine clan spoke with admiration, looking at the terrifying storm in the sky.

"Can't withstand!" Luo Tian's heart was also terrified, seeing the terrifying storm rushing toward him.

Although Luo Tian had now reached Supreme Stage, he was still fragile before a sage's attack.

This storm brought more冲击 than the one from Jin Yongsi in the sect war, and they were completely different levels.

"Still..." The Snow Phoenix's eyes showed a hint of triumph, its black pupils showing human-like gentleness.

As the Snow Phoenix's words fell, the furious ice storm stopped abruptly just before engulfing Luo Tian. It halted in front of his body.

"Ah... well, you saw it. I could kill you easily. Considering your youth and reaching Supreme Stage, today I'll let you go. Be careful in the future; some people aren't worth provoking!" The Snow Phoenix's voice carried a touch of tolerance, even admiration. It was the kind of tolerance and kindness that an elder shows to a junior.

"Damn it, this actually works!" Sun Mingtian's group had previously been amazed by the Snow Phoenix's power, admiring its strength and also delighted that Luo Tian would die.

But then the Snow Phoenix's move turned around, causing Sun Mingtian's group to almost curse. Luo Tian, who had already been doomed, was now spared by the Snow Phoenix's mercy.

"You really think you're a god? You've even shown kindness to our clan's enemies!" Sun Mingtian's group inwardly cursed, never expecting this powerful Snow Phoenix to be so merciful.

"But you want to let me go, but I don't want to let you go!" However, Luo Tian's voice echoed in people's ears.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with waves of purple lightning. His body was filled with black aura, and a playful voice came from his mouth.

Luo Tian's body didn't stop at all. He directly rushed toward the storm that had been stopped by the Snow Phoenix, as if he hadn't felt the terror of the storm before. He dove into the storm's range.

"You really seek death, don't you? Disperse!" The Snow Phoenix saw Luo Tian's body filled with black aura rushing toward it, speaking as if afraid Luo Tian would be injured. It waved its wings and dispersed the storm it had stopped, shouting loudly.

"Yes! I'm determined to seek death today. You're at least as strong as a sage medium, right? Today I'll experience the strength of the sage stage!" Luo Tian laughed loudly. His eyes no longer showed fear but instead a hint of provocation and arrogance as he spoke to the Snow Phoenix.

"Madness, this world is mad. A Supreme Stage being dares to challenge a sage stage!" Nan Gong Yuqing and Li Tianzhi's faces showed surprise, watching Luo Tian rushing toward the Snow Phoenix with black aura and shouting loudly.

"Haha! Luo Tian, you're seeking death. Watch how our clan's guardian beast of old will kill you!" Sun Mingtian laughed loudly, never expecting Luo Tian to be so foolish as to repeatedly provoke the Snow Phoenix.

But in an instant, everyone's mouths opened into an 'o' shape. They could fit an egg into it. Their faces showed disbelief, looking at the sky.

Because on the sky, Luo Tian's aura was getting stronger and stronger. His smile became more and more intense. His eyes flashed with purple, as if he hadn't felt the pressure from the Snow Phoenix at all. He turned into a black light and rushed toward the Snow Phoenix.

Meanwhile, the Snow Phoenix's massive body was constantly retreating. Its eyes became panicked.

"What's going on? A sage stage divine beast is being pushed back by a Supreme Stage one?" A young disciple of the divine clan showed disbelief, watching the chase between Luo Tian and the Snow Phoenix.

People had never seen such a situation before. This was unprecedented.

"Kid, how did you figure it out?" A焦急 (anxious) voice entered Luo Tian's ears, making his smile even more intense.

"Indeed, I was right. If it weren't for my frequent pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger, I really would have been caught by this beast today!" Luo Tian inwardly laughed coldly. If it weren't for the Purple Extreme Eye and his rarely used simulation aura technique, he wouldn't have dared to judge this powerful Snow Phoenix as a paper tiger.

"Fake it! Keep faking it!" Luo Tian transmitted his voice into the Snow Phoenix's mind. His body was filled with black aura, and his black demon sword reappeared in his hand.

Chapter 842: The幽冥鬼貂 (Yomou Guicao)

On the Sacred Beast Continent, Luo Tian stood in the sky, his body filled with demon aura. His eyes showed mockery as he looked at the snow-white Snow Phoenix flying in the sky. His demon sword slowly凝聚 (gathered).

"Don't fight, don't fight! Let's talk!" The Snow Phoenix's voice entered Luo Tian's ears. A smile appeared on Luo Tian's face.

"Stop fighting? You've been scaring me for so long, and now you tell me not to fight. If it weren't for my intelligence, I really would have been tricked! Come on, don't pay any price today, you won't get away!" Luo Tian's demon sword slashed out. He directly launched the fourth strike of the Seven Demon Blades.

A powerful blade's light cut through space, instantly rushing toward the massive, snow-white Snow Phoenix.

"Reveal yourself!" Luo Tian's low roar echoed as the black blade instantly reached the Snow Phoenix, striking it.

"Ah..." A scream echoed into people's ears. It sounded like a great injury. The white Snow Phoenix continuously cried out, circling in the sky.

On the ground, people stared in disbelief at the Snow Phoenix crying out in the sky. They couldn't understand how the Snow Phoenix, who had previously been so powerful and had pressure exceeding sage medium stage, a sacred beast worshipped by the divine clan for countless years, could be screamed at by this Luo Tian, a small kid.

"What's going on? I'm a bit confused!" Ren Hongzhe slapped his head and spoke softly.

The divine clan's group was also stunned, looking at the one person and one beast in the sky. Then they turned their eyes to Sun Mingtian, who was also stunned.

"I also want to know what's going on!" Sun Mingtian inwardly cursed, but his face showed a mysterious expression: "Maybe the divine beast was sealed for too long and just came out, feeling bored. It wanted to play with this kid!"

"Yes! That's definitely it!" Sun Mingtian seemed to feel his reasoning was correct. After all, the Snow Phoenix had been sealed for so long. Anyone would go crazy being alone under this altar, and their personality would definitely change.

"Ah! That's why I said our divine clan has always worshipped a sacred beast, but it was so weak. It's being screamed at by a Supreme Stage!" A young disciple of the divine clan showed a smile, regaining his previous arrogance.

At the same time, Luo Tian stood in the sky and slashed three more times. Each of the three blade lights struck the Snow Phoenix's body, causing a large number of white feathers to fall from the sky.

However, what was strange was that those feather-sized feathers didn't reach the ground before turning into waves of energy and disappearing from people's sight.

"Kid, are you really going to make me fight? You've seen my strength. Do you really want me to kill you?" The Snow Phoenix angrily spoke to Luo Tian.

"Come on, come on! Let me see how terrifying the attack of a sage stage is!" Luo Tian's face showed arrogance as he spoke loudly to the Snow Phoenix in the sky, his voice echoing in people's ears.

"Our divine clan's sacred beast is too kind. It can still endure such humiliation. Indeed, it's a role model for us!" Sun Mingtian showed admiration on his face, his eyes filled with respect as he spoke, causing the divine clan's people to sigh.

"Haha!" Xuanwu's old tortoise showed a mysterious smile, looking at the snow-white Snow Phoenix. Although it still had the aura of the Snow Phoenix, he noticed something when the feathers fell from the Snow Phoenix.

"This is what you forced me to do!" The Snow Phoenix cried out, its massive wings slowly opening again. It was clearly furious.

"It's beginning! Haha! Luo Tian, you really have the courage. Our clan people can't compare with you!" The divine clan's disciples spoke loudly, their eyes filled with anticipation, waiting for the scene of Luo Tian being crushed by the Snow Phoenix.

"Buzz..." The massive wings slowly flapped again. The terrifying aura and storm from before formed again under the Snow Phoenix's flap, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Kid, run away!" The Snow Phoenix coldly spoke, its voice carrying a hint of charity.

"At this point, you're still pretending! Today I'll make you reveal your true form!" Luo Tian's face showed no fear at all. His body turned into a black light and rushed toward the storm in the sky.

"Damn it, damn it! How did he figure it out? I once tricked the divine clan's god king, a sage-level great power. Today I was tricked by this kid who hasn't even grown his fur yet!" The Snow Phoenix inwardly shouted, watching Luo Tian rushing into the storm without any fear.

"Haha! Seeking death!" The divine clan's people saw Luo Tian rushing into the storm and showed joyous laughter.

"I said, why is the Four Saints Star Region the weakest of the nine regions? It's because of this kind of fool!" Sun Mingtian showed a cold smile, looking at Luo Tian who had rushed into the storm and disappeared from people's sight.

Hearing Sun Mingtian's words, Sha Cangmang and others showed anger. Sun Mingtian's words obviously included them all.

But due to Sun Mingtian's powerful strength, Sha Cangmang and others dared to be angry but couldn't speak out. They just sighed inwardly, the Four Saints Star Region was indeed too weak. For many years, it had only produced one Supreme Stage strength, and now it was about to perish.

Xuanwu's old tortoise showed no sorrow or joy, but his aged eyes were filled with mockery. He looked at Sun Mingtian, waiting for his surprised expression.

"Buzz..." People didn't see Luo Tian being torn apart by the storm. Instead, he appeared as if nothing had happened on top of the Snow Phoenix's head, his black demon sword slowly raised.

"Reveal yourself!" Luo Tian held the black demon sword, with terrifying waves. The tip of the blade pointed downward and rushed toward the Snow Phoenix's massive head.

"What's going on? The storm didn't harm Luo Tian at all?" Young disciples of the divine clan showed stunned faces.

Sun Mingtian also looked uneasy. At this moment, he finally felt something was wrong, as if it wasn't what he had imagined.

While people were astonished, Luo Tian's black demon sword also rushed into the Snow Phoenix's head. Naturally, it was met with a series of screams.

"Boom..." In the next moment, the Snow Phoenix's massive body exploded in people's stunned gaze. Terrifying demon energy raged in the sky, stirring up the calm heavens again.

Sun Mingtian and other divine clan people showed disbelief. Their mouths were wide open, their hearts feeling like they had eaten dirt.

At this point, even a fool could see that the Snow Phoenix, which had looked so powerful before, was just an illusion.

The moment the Snow Phoenix exploded, the storm it had created also disappeared from people's sight as if it had never existed.

"Has it come out?" Luo Tian's eyes showed anticipation, looking down to see what kind of creature this one who had tricked everyone looked like.

His gaze fell upon a small black creature, which was vastly different from the massive Snow Phoenix. It was like comparing ten thousand miles.

Black fur, black eyes, no stray hairs on its entire body. It was about half a chi in length. Its black eyes showed incredible liveliness.

"Fox?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, looking at the black fox standing only a hundred zhang away from him. His face showed confusion.

People on the ground, although they were far from Luo Tian and the black fox, could clearly see the small fox that was only half a chi in size. They were speechless for a moment.

"Haha! This is the legendary guardian sacred beast worshipped by our divine clan. Haha, I'm dying laughing! What is this? A dog?" Ren Hongzhe and others looked at the black fox in the sky with mockery, looking at the divine clan people and laughing loudly.

Sun Mingtian and Sun Xinghuo's group of several divine clan people turned red-faced. They never expected the true form of their divine clan's sacred beast to look like this.

"Ah..." The black fox showed anger on its face, looking at Luo Tian. If it weren't for Luo Tian himself, maybe it would have been taken by the divine clan and continued to live a life of trickery.

"Kid, I already let you go. You still messed up my plans. The Fox Lord will fight with you!" The black fox shouted, turning into a black light and instantly disappearing from the spot. It rushed toward Luo Tian.

"How come you regained your true form? Don't you fear me?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of smile.

But in the next moment, Luo Tian felt a chill on his chest. A tooth mark appeared on his chest.

"This speed!" Luo Tian inwardly startled. He hadn't felt the black fox move at all. Even with his current Supreme Stage cultivation, he had only seen a flash of light. This showed how terrifying the black fox's speed was.

"How about that? Are you scared now?" The black fox's eyes showed a hint of pride as it spoke to Luo Tian.

"Really fast, but its attack doesn't seem to hurt me!" Luo Tian looked at his chest. Not a single drop of blood was left.

"Yomou Guicao! This is Yomou Guicao! I never thought I would see it instead of the Snow Phoenix. It's rarer than the Snow Phoenix!" Xuanwu's old tortoise showed surprise on his face. As soon as the black fox appeared, Xuanwu immediately thought about what kind of creature it was.

"Never mind. Although you messed up my plans, I don't want to argue with you. Today is over. Next time we meet, I'll take your life!" The black fox arrogantly spoke, its body moving toward the Sacred Beast Continent outside.

"Don't let it go. It's Yomou Guicao, a legendary creature known as the Spirit-Seeking Fox. It's a rare treasure of the world!" Xuanwu's old tortoise shouted at Luo Tian, who was standing there thinking.

Chapter 843: Capturing the冥兽 (Ming Shou)

On the Sacred Beast Continent, a black light streaked through space toward the outside of the Sacred Beast Continent. Its speed was极致 (extreme), as if it had broken through space's limit. Even Luo Tian couldn't keep up with the black light's speed.

"Don't let it escape. It's Yomou Guicao, a legendary Spirit-Seeking Fox. It's a treasure of the world!" Xuanwu's old tortoise spoke to Luo Tian, his face showing excitement.

"Let it go?" Luo Tian's mouth twitched. His face showed a bitter expression, looking at the black light that had already left his perception range.

"Can't catch it. It's too fast. It's beyond the Supreme Stage's speed!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, knowing he couldn't catch that black fox. Such speed was beyond anyone's ability to follow unless one reached the sage stage. Otherwise, Luo Tian had no chance at all.

The divine clan people stared in shock at the residual energy after the Yomou Guicao escaped. They never expected things to turn out this way. They had thought Luo Tian was definitely doomed, but in the end, their divine clan's sacred beast wasn't as powerful as legend.

At this moment, the divine clan people realized that the Yomou Guicao was actually the true form of the Snow Phoenix. The previous massive body had just been a transformation by the Yomou Guicao. This Yomou Guicao's strength was only at the Nine Sources Stage, not even reaching Supreme Stage.

"Tricked! And tricked for countless generations!" The divine clan thought about how the Yomou Guicao had been worshipped as a sacred beast for generations, and they felt like vomiting.

"Haha! Sacred beast, my god! Haha!" Ren Hongzhe and others laughed loudly at the divine clan people's faces, which looked like withered eggplants. They didn't hide their mockery.

The people of Qinglong Sect and Xuanwu Sect also couldn't help but laugh. They never expected the powerful divine clan, even with a sage in charge, to be tricked by such a small creature for countless years. If this spread to the other regions, it would surely cause a storm.

"Damn it! Kill them all!" Sun Mingtian's face was dark as he looked at Nan Gong Yuqing and the other two sects' people, his face filled with killing intent.

The divine clan had always been arrogant and looked down on anyone. If this spread, it would be a slap in the face of the divine clan. To protect their reputation, they had to kill these people to silence them.

"How come you're still thinking about how to kill these people now? Your clan's head must have been kicked by a donkey!" Luo Tian stood in the sky, seeing Sun Mingtian's killing intent. He knew what Sun Mingtian was thinking.

His body was filled with black aura, and his black demon sword slowly凝聚 (gathered). Feeling the time he had entered the demonic state, Luo Tian's eyes also showed a hint of cruelty.

"Kill them all!" Luo Tian's eyes were filled with killing intent. He stretched out his hand, tearing a piece of space and sending Nan Gong Yuqing and others, as well as the people from Xuanwu Sect, outside the Sacred Beast Continent.

He furrowed his brows and looked at Sha Cangmang and others from Qinglong Sect. Luo Tian sighed lightly, sending Sha Cangmang and others outside the Sacred Beast Continent as well.

Seeing Luo Tian's actions, Sun Mingtian's face showed a cold expression. He knew that with Luo Tian around, Nan Gong Yuqing and others couldn't be killed. As long as he killed Luo Tian, the others would be like ants before him.

"Buzz..." Before Sun Mingtian could think further, Luo Tian launched the attack first. His black demon sword was raised again, and endless demonic energy continuously poured into it, making the sword grow larger.

"Let me finish you all with one move. Also, test how powerful the fifth strike of the Seven Demon Blades really is!" Luo Tian's face showed anticipation. He didn't want to waste time with Sun Mingtian and others anymore.

They were naturally enemies, leaving no room for compromise. Therefore, Luo Tian didn't plan to let these people leave the Sacred Beast Continent alive. If he delayed any longer, his demonic state would end, which would be detrimental to him.

Another reason for Luo Tian to quickly end the battle was that he had now advanced to the Supreme Stage. It was time to return to the Tianyuan Continent.

Thinking of his parents, relatives, and friends on the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian's heart was filled with grass. He didn't want to waste a single moment and longed to return home.

As Luo Tian raised his demon sword, the entire Sacred Beast Continent fell into endless darkness. In the river of冥河 (Minghe), the beast lay still beneath the river, its massive body trembling constantly.

"Boom... boom..." In the sky, a series of voids exploded, turning into terrifying demonic energy that poured into the demon sword. A terrifying pressure instantly invaded Sun Mingtian and his group of divine clan people.

"Can't stop it!" Sun Mingtian's face showed a hint of fear. He never expected Luo Tian's martial art to be so powerful. Even he felt small in front of the black demon sword's shadow.

"Strong! Truly strong. The Supreme Stage really is different. Using the fifth strike of the Seven Demon Blades, it only felt a bit exhausted!" Luo Tian saw both hands holding the sword and looked at the massive demon sword in the sky, showing admiration.

On the ground, Sun Xinghuo and others showed fear, looking at the sword's shadow in the sky. Under the pressure, they fell to the ground, their bodies emitting a series of cracking sounds.

"Die!" Luo Tian's aura reached its peak. The massive demon sword shadow finally solidified into reality, slowly descending upon Sun Mingtian and others.

The demon sword seemed slow, but countless cracks spread around it, slicing through space. It instantly descended upon Sun Mingtian's group.

"Boom..." The supreme altar shattered before the demon sword even fell, turning into pieces of stone that flew in all directions.

Sun Mingtian and others were completely stunned. They felt like an ordinary person facing the heavens' power, with no desire to resist at all.

"Crack..." Finally, the sword's shadow met the ground. A large amount of smoke slowly rose from the ground, forming a terrifying storm that swept out of the Sacred Beast Continent.

Luo Tian felt admiration. He knew that with this strike, even he wouldn't survive. He admired the elder from Tiger Fortress for creating such a technique.

"Go!" Luo Tian roared, and the storm swept over him. It blew his clothes, and he looked at the center of the storm, stepping into the void and disappearing from the spot.

Luo Tian knew his current state wasn't good either. The fifth strike of the Seven Demon Blades had consumed too much energy, and his black whirlpool in the dantian had shrunk by eight-tenths to perform it.

Moreover, his demonic state had already passed. If Sun Mingtian survived, he wouldn't be able to stop him from escaping. But Luo Tian also knew that even if Sun Mingtian survived, he would be severely injured and wouldn't come out unscathed.

"Before I leave, I should capture this beast. That creature is also a rare species!" Luo Tian's face showed a smile. In an instant, he appeared on the Supreme Bridge and entered the Supreme Stage. Now he could clearly see the beast beneath the river, lying on the water.

"Haha! I almost got eaten by you before. Today I'll take this beast and let my Tianyuan Sect cultivate the original energy within its body. That would be quite good!" Luo Tian's eyes showed mockery as he looked at the beast's massive body.

The beast lay still beneath the river, its body trembling again. Its eight large eyes showed waves of confusion: "Strange, why have I felt a sense of fear and trembling these past days? Did something happen to me?"

As it pondered, the beast's gaze turned upward. It saw Luo Tian with a thoughtful expression looking at it in the river.

"It's him!" The beast's massive body rolled over, and the river water instantly surged up.

"Kid! Why are you back here again!" The beast's face showed anger, appearing on the water surface and roaring at Luo Tian.

"I said I would make you submit to me. Today I'm here to keep my promise!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of smile as he spoke to the beast.

"Haha! In this river, I'm invincible. If you dare come down and catch me!" The beast's face showed contempt, looking at Luo Tian standing on the Supreme Bridge with a smile.

"Good. I'm coming down!" Luo Tian stood on the bridge railing, laughing lightly and leaping into the air toward the beast.

"This..." Seeing Luo Tian actually flying toward him, the beast initially showed a hint of joy. In its view, Luo Tian was clearly seeking death.

But in the next moment, its eight eyes widened, and all eight mouths spoke at once: "Supreme Stage. The one who advanced to Supreme Stage in the deep continent was you!"

"Yes!" Luo Tian wasn't at his peak now, but he was still a Supreme Stage. The river's suction for the Supreme Stage was a problem, but it wasn't that deadly for the Supreme Stage.

As Luo Tian flew into the sky, he felt a pressure pressing down on him. However, it was much less than that of the sage stage.

"Come on, submit to me!" Luo Tian's face showed a hint of smile. His spear was in hand, and the Supreme Stage pressure pressed down on the beast.

"Impossible! I am a beast that took millions of years to be born. How could I submit to this small human? My master can only be the Lord of the冥域 (Mingyu)!" The beast roared, and its eight heads emitted eight sources of original energy. They converged into a long dragon that roared toward Luo Tian.
