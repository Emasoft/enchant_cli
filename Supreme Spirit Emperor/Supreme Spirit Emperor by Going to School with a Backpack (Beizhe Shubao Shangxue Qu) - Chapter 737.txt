“Who?” Upon hearing the shout, Luo Tian, Yang Huanyu, and the Eternal Immortal King all turned their gazes toward the figure almost simultaneously.

"Mo Si!" Luo Tian's eyes widened with astonishment. He had not expected Mo Si to appear at this moment, especially since he was merely an Immortal King at the late stage. The fluctuations of their battle were beyond Mo Si's capacity to withstand.

Yet, in the next moment, Luo Tian's thoughts shifted. For Mo Si's one eye radiated waves that distorted the heavens and earth. With a thunderous roar, Yang Huanyu's celestial chessboard was disrupted, shattering with a resounding crash before Luo Tian's eyes.

"Go..." Seizing the opportunity, Luo Tian would not let it slip away. He directed the intangible fluctuations in his hand toward Yang Huanyu and the Eternal Immortal Emperor.

The power was overwhelming, and in an instant, a thunderous surge erupted from the collapsing void. Thunderous roars echoed as it descended upon Yang Huanyu and the Eternal Immortal Emperor, causing Yang Huanyu's expression to finally shift. Especially for the Eternal Immortal Emperor, he had previously been killed by Luo Tian's technique; it was only thanks to the Eternal Bloom that he hadn't vanished completely. His luck had been fortunate—he had been struck into a small world, where he slaughtered the entire realm and nourished the Eternal Bloom with it. Thus obtaining a World Heart, the Eternal Immortal King had ascended to the Emperor's realm through the Eternal Bloom and World Heart.

Faced with this move he could never forget, the Eternal Immortal Emperor roared. The Eternal Bloom radiated waves as its petals surged wildly, enveloping both Yang Huanyu and the Eternal Immortal Emperor. At the same time, Yang Huanyu also unleashed a series of black rune chains that coiled around the Eternal Bloom.

A thunderous explosion echoed in the starry sky, stars shattered, and the entire world plunged into darkness. Amidst the thunderous waves, the blood-red Eternal Bloom was submerged and vanished from Luo Tian's sight.

Luo Tian then moved swiftly, grabbing Mo Si who was filled with shock and pulling him before himself. He opened a domain to block the wild冲击.

"Too strong! In my lifetime, witnessing an Emperor's battle—death is worth it!" Mo Si spoke, his gaze turning to Luo Tian.

"Go back. This place is not for you..." Luo Tian replied, intending to send Mo Si away.

"No, you are no match for them. I might be able to hold off Yang Huanyu!"

"I have endured in the Luo Sheng Gate for centuries, all for this day!" Mo Si shook his head, his eyes filled with ferocity. Blood flowed from the corners of his eyes.

Hmph... Luo Tian was slightly stunned, gazing at Mo Si's eyes filled with hatred and saw the madness within.

Luo Tian could feel Mo Si's hatred, understood his pain. Enduring for centuries in the Luo Sheng Gate without a chance to retaliate.

"I can't avenge myself, but you can. So I beg you, Luo Tian, help me avenge!" Mo Si spoke to Luo Tian, his voice filled with entreaty.

"I can only try. But Mo Xiong, you should still go back. You truly cannot stay here!" Luo Tian continued to persuade Mo Si, seeing the intent of death in his eyes.

"I have made my decision. Don't stop me, Luo Xiong. I hope you can bring peace to this world. The Luo Sheng Gate's purpose is to destroy the entire immortal realm. As for why, I don't know!" Mo Si spoke with a solemn tone. He had spent years in the Luo Sheng Gate and knew its strength well.

As he spoke, Mo Si's face showed a faint smile. His hands moved swiftly, imprinting strange symbols onto his body.

In the next moment, it seemed some strange power invaded Mo Si's body. Mo Si himself began to be rapidly consumed and vanished from Luo Tian's sight.

"Luo Tian, everything is in your hands!" Mo Si gradually disappeared, his face always showing entreaty.

Luo Tian watched Mo Si vanish, feeling uncomfortable. How many people like Mo Si were there in the immortal realm and hell?

The petals opened, revealing Yang Huanyu and the Eternal Immortal Emperor. Both were covered in blood. Even with the protection of the Eternal Bloom, especially Yang Huanyu's right eye was hollow, blood flowing down his cheek.

"Unexpectedly, a worm-like person has wounded me!" Yang Huanyu spoke, his voice carrying a sinister tone. Clearly not referring to Luo Tian.

Sacrificing himself to inflict a wound on Yang Huanyu, this injury was severe. Even after their previous battle, Luo Tian had not wounded Yang Huanyu to this extent.

"What else do you have?" Yang Huanyu spoke, the celestial chessboard reformed, radiating an overwhelming aura. At the same time, the Eternal Immortal Gate also rose again, hovering above Luo Tian's head.

The pressure returned, making Luo Tian's face grim. However, he could clearly feel that their attack intensity had weakened slightly compared to before.

"Still not a match. How can I severely injure them?" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, gathering lightning in his palm and striking toward the Eternal Immortal Gate.

At the same time, the Broken Sword of Heaven fell into Luo Tian's hand. The sword's radiance surged as Luo Tian moved like a dragon through the stars, appearing in various corners of space. A series of sword qi followed, forming a net of swords that swept toward the celestial chessboard.

In an instant, Yang Huanyu and the Eternal Immortal Emperor's techniques roared down, shattering the starry void and pressing toward Luo Tian.

Boom... Boom... The thunderous roars echoed. The palm lightning shattered the Eternal Immortal Gate, but the massive celestial chessboard shattered waves of sword qi that pressed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian raised his fist to meet the massive chessboard, but his body was once again crushed by it. A crack echoed from his flesh as he spat out blood violently.

"Again..." Yang Huanyu roared, gathering techniques again with the Eternal Immortal Emperor to strike Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, on the battlefield of Tianyuan Sect, blood continuously spilled. Several corpses lay there, many of whom Luo Tian knew. Baihu and Hei Bai were weak, almost severed in two by Yin Xuanbing's sword. Their heads bore cuts.

"Can't hold on much longer..." Baihu and Hei Bai thought bitterly. Their world treasure wheel had been cut off, showing how fierce the battle was. Yin Xuanbing and another half-Emperor were also covered in blood.

"Kid, when I dominated the heavens and earth, you didn't even know what to do!" Yin Xuanbing controlled his sword tip, striking toward Baihu and Hei Bai.

Another half-Emperor swung a black whip lined with blades, sealing the void and cutting off all escape routes for Baihu and Hei Bai. If this sword struck or the whip hit, they would not survive.

Baihu and Hei Bai dodged the sword but could not escape the black whip!

Zhon... Just as the black whip was about to strike Baihu and Hei Bai, a large hand emerged from the void and grabbed the whip.

Chapter 2809: Heading to the Sealing()

Creak... The large hand gripped the whip, making the half-Emperor's face grim. He pulled forcefully, but the large hand remained unmoved.

A figure stepped out from the void. His white robe was as pure as snow, one hand gripping a long sword, and the other also holding a long sword. His aura was imposing, his presence alone giving an impression of invincibility. Even the half-Emperor on the battlefield had to bow their head.

"Master Gu!" Diao Dezhu and others exclaimed, their eyes filled with intense joy.

"Who dares harm my nine domains!" As Gu Tianshu appeared, the void trembled again. A furious roar echoed through the heavens, and a series of figures emerged from the void. Each radiated powerful energy.

One hundred and eight people stood under the sky, looking down upon the world. Upon their appearance, the entire battlefield halted. It was because of the immense pressure these one hundred and eight people carried.

"Have they appeared?" Upon their appearance, Yang Huanyu and Luo Tian felt it. Yang Huanyu muttered lowly, his lips subtly curling as he continued to attack Luo Tian.

"Ten Heavens!" Zhang Daotian and others exclaimed, their eyes filled with reverence. They all knew of the existence of Ten Heavens.

Yet they were puzzled as to why all one hundred and eight people from Ten Heavens had appeared. Ten Heavens was sealed with terrifying things, preventing them from moving.

"Fan Tianhai has come to support the immortal realm!"

"Zhongtian Commercial Guild has arrived to support!" Upon the appearance of these one hundred and eight people, more figures emerged from afar. Each possessed the strength of an Immortal King.

"Rest for now, we'll take over from you!" Gu Tianshu spoke to the people of Tianyuan Sect, his gaze scanning over the Luo Sheng Gate's strength.

"Long time no see! Finally can stretch my limbs!" A shout echoed as an old man wielded a steel spear, rushing toward an Immortal King at the peak.

"Don't grab it all! These three are mine!" As the old man rushed out, the remaining Ten Heavens people shouted loudly, transforming into a stream of light and rushing toward the Luo Sheng Gate's forces. Only two figures remained.

The people of Tianyuan Sect retreated, their eyes filled with strange looks as they watched the forces charging toward the Luo Sheng Gate like wolves, feeling this battle was already decided.

Boom...

Indeed, within one hundred and six people, only a single charge resulted in several Immortal Kings of the Luo Sheng Gate falling.

"Monsters..." Even those who had come to support, like Fan Tianhai and Zhongtian Commercial Guild, took a breath in shock.

"Five half-Emperors and two Emperors!" Zhu Jiu Yin exclaimed, watching the one hundred and eight people who had not moved. Among them was Gu Tianshu and another middle-aged man, the leader of Jietian.

"Let's go!" Gu Tianshu and Jietian Leader exchanged a glance. Their battlefield was not here, but with Luo Tian.

They took steps into the sky, and in the star fields, they saw Luo Tian being pressed by Yang Huanyu and the Eternal Immortal Emperor.

"Master Gu!" Luo Tian's eyes also showed joy. He hadn't expected Gu Tianshu and Jietian Leader to have ascended to the Emperor's realm.

Yang Huanyu and the Eternal Immortal Emperor retreated, standing under the starry sky. Their gazes turned to Gu Tianshu and Jietian Leader.

"Unexpectedly, you've deceived me!" Yang Huanyu sighed, gazing at Gu Tianshu and Jietian Leader.

"Deceive? Where is the deception? We simply suppressed our strength, and it was also due to the efforts of all past Ten Heavens guardians!"

"Would we have come out if we didn't appear weak? The Heaven's Divinity!" Jietian Leader spoke.

Heaven's Divinity!

Upon hearing Jietian Leader's words, Luo Tian's eyes widened. He gazed at Yang Huanyu with disbelief.

"Has the sealing been abandoned?" Yang Huanyu asked, gazing into the distance, looking toward the timelessly old mountain.

"Of course someone is in charge there. However, now we need to eliminate you. Once you are eliminated, the sealing will be unharmed!" Jietian Leader spoke, his hands moving swiftly. A golden seal fell into his palm and pressed toward Yang Huanyu.

"Kill!" Gu Tianshu's long hair flew as he slashed a sword toward Yang Huanyu.

Luo Tian raised his spear, rushing toward Yang Huanyu. However, Yang Huanyu showed no surprise. He formed a chessboard that covered his head and then struck toward the Eternal Immortal Emperor.

"You!" The Eternal Immortal Emperor hadn't expected Yang Huanyu to strike him. Although he had been controlled by Yang Huanyu, he still possessed his own consciousness. Yet, when Yang Huanyu attacked him, he couldn't resist.

"Deceiving me!" The Eternal Immortal Emperor roared but was immediately shattered into a blood mist before Yang Huanyu's eyes.

"Originally, you fed my Eternal Bloom. I should have let you go. But I had no choice!" Yang Huanyu spoke softly, the blood-red Eternal Bloom emitting a suction force that completely absorbed the Eternal Immortal Emperor's blood.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The powerful attacks of Luo Tian and the others shattered the celestial chessboard, continuing to strike toward Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu opened his mouth and absorbed the Eternal Bloom into his body. In an instant, a mark of the Eternal Bloom appeared on his forehead. As he merged with the Eternal Bloom, Yang Huanyu's aura as an Emperor increased, seemingly breaking through some boundary.

Yang Huanyu waved his hand, causing the void to tremble. A storm arose, and Luo Tian's attacks were deflected by Yang Huanyu.

"Ten Heavens Seal!" Jietian Leader's hands moved swiftly. His first move was to use his full strength, knowing that Yang Huanyu might have surpassed the Emperor's realm.

"Play with you later!" Yang Huanyu laughed, standing there as the mighty seal pressed upon his body. In an instant, a shocking scene appeared before Luo Tian: Yang Huanyu's body vanished within their sight. The massive Ten Heavens Seal crashed into the depths of space.

"Integrated into Heaven!" Jietian Leader and Gu Tianshu's faces darkened.

"Diverting the tiger, hurry back to the timelessly old mountain!" Suddenly, Jietian Leader shouted and moved swiftly through the starry void.

"What's wrong with Master Gu?" Luo Tian and Gu Tianshu followed Jietian Leader, while Luo Tian asked Gu Tianshu.

"He is the Heaven's Divinity. His mission is to destroy the entire immortal realm, meaning we all must die!"

"Because an ancient Emperor appeared in the past and wounded him severely. He wants to eliminate everyone, creating new humans to prevent being hurt again. Heaven is indifferent; the billions of lives in the immortal realm are nothing to him!" Upon hearing Gu Tianshu's words, Luo Tian instantly understood. This was another form of immortality because they posed a threat to Heaven. If they destroyed Heaven, Yang Huanyu's Divinity would also perish. If Heaven existed, then Yang Huanyu would never die, even if a new immortal realm was created.

Chapter 2810: Appearance()

"Inside the Ten Heavens, there is a seal of Heaven's Divinity. In ancient times, it was sealed by an ancient Emperor. We have always guarded that seal. Originally, we planned to come out and kill Yang Huanyu so the Divinity within the seal could be handled!"

"Unexpectedly, while we plotted against him, he also plotted against us. He diverted the tiger and started this war to make us come out and support you!" Gu Tianshu explained to Luo Tian. The three of them flew swiftly through the starry void, and Gu Tianshu quickly explained to Luo Tian.

"Is there anyone guarding the Ten Heavens?" Gu Tianshu asked Luo Tian, making him understand.

"There is. However, we don't know if they can hold it. If they cannot, then he will open the seal and merge with the Divinity, which would be powerful enough to eliminate us all!"

"Because he is Heaven. Though invisible, it has created a Divinity to fulfill its intentions in another form!" Gu Tianshu replied.

As they spoke, Jietian Leader suddenly stopped his body and rapidly descended into the starry void. He extended his hand, tearing open the void and rushing into it with Luo Tian and Gu Tianshu. In an instant, the scene changed; they burst out of the void and directly landed under the blue sky. They precisely descended to the location where the ancient Ten Heavens had been.

On the vast altar, eight people sat in meditation. Each radiated a surge of energy. Upon the appearance of Luo Tian and the others, they suddenly opened their eyes.

Luo Tian saw these eight people and was filled with surprise. He recognized some of them, but only a few were unfamiliar.

The eight people were all old men. One was the first generation of the era's ruler of the nine domains, Wang Duantian!

Another was an old man in black robes but with golden hair. Luo Tian had never seen him in person, but he had seen his portrait. He was the ruler of the Divine Beasts Domain!

A middle-aged man in yellow robes, who was the soul of the Yellow Spring evolved into the Yellow Spring. Next to him stood an old man, a former strength of the Tianyuan Continent, Yin Tianxiong.

The most eye-catching was an old man in gray robes with small eyes, giving a猥琐 feeling. Luo Tian felt a familiar aura from him. It wasn't Longque, who else could it be?

Meidusha was also among them. These eight people had the weakest strength as a half-Emperor, with four Emperor-level strengths.

"Terrifying!" Luo Tian's heart clenched. This was a force capable of annihilating everything.

"How fast you returned? Did something change?" A figure in black robes looked at Gu Tianshu and Jietian Leader. In ancient times, he was a strong figure from the same era as Longque, and people called him the Dark God.

"Left. Did you not notice anything strange?" Jietian Leader replied, gazing at the massive seal guarded by eight people.

"No. We have always been here and haven't noticed any fluctuations!" The Dark God replied, his brows furrowed. His eyes suddenly narrowed.

"This..." The Dark God and Wang Duantian were shocked, because at this moment, a faint illusion mark appeared on the vast sky. If not carefully observed, it was impossible to notice.

"When?"

"Damn!" Longque cursed lowly. Others also changed faces, because they confirmed that this mark was definitely added in the past two days. Even they hadn't noticed.

"He has entered..." They sighed, exchanging glances.

Luo Tian's face was also grim. If Yang Huanyu truly merged with other Divinities, what a terrifying thing it would be.

"Currently, there is only one path left: open the seal and fight our way in!" The Dark God spoke, making everyone's faces serious.

"If that is the case, we truly have no way back!" Jietian Leader replied. They could still try to seal it.

"The seal is no longer holding, the energy inside has become stronger these days. Even without merging, this seal won't last long!" Longque replied. These past few days had been his responsibility to guard the seal, and he knew its condition.

"Then break it. Fight our way in. Catch him before he fully merges and kills him. If we kill him, and prevent him from merging with Heaven, there will still be a chance!"

"Luo Tian, I don't have time to explain much. But there will be a big battle ahead. This fight is everything. At critical moments, we may have to sacrifice our lives. Be ready!" Gu Tianshu spoke to Luo Tian. If it wasn't for necessity, he wouldn't have let Luo Tian get involved.

"Master Gu, rest assured!" Luo Tian nodded. His gaze turned to the endless sky, clenching his fists. No matter what, he would fight.

"Start!" The Dark God spoke, and at the same time his hands moved swiftly, imprinting seals onto the boundless barrier.

Besides Luo Tian, others also launched their attacks. A series of powerful seals flew out and were imprinted on all sides of the barrier.

Luo Tian simply stood there watching. He hadn't had time to catch up with Longque and others, so he sat cross-legged to adjust his state. He had been severely injured from fighting Yang Huanyu and the Emperor of Supplementing Heaven.

……

On another side, on the battlefield of Tianyuan Sect, the Ten Heavens forces attacked like wolves and finally wiped out all members of Luo Sheng Gate.

"We won!" The people of Tianyuan Sect shouted, their voices filled with excitement.

…… Just as everyone cheered, the originally淡 blue sky suddenly changed to blood red. At the same time, the blood on the ground transformed into blood vapor and floated upward toward the sky. The heavens roiled, creating an extremely terrifying scene.

"What's happening?" Not only on the battlefield of Tianyuan Sect, but in every part of the immortal realm, the sky turned blood red. The blood on the ground transformed into vapor and floated toward the heavens.

"Something has changed. That kid, what's left is up to you. Stop the war and return to the timelessly old mountain!" A half-Emperor elder looked at Jiang Nanxuan and spoke, while the hundred or so people transformed into streams of light and flew toward the timelessly old mountain.

"Something has happened!" Yaochen, Yao Huangtian and others felt the urgency of the Ten Heavens forces. They guessed something big had happened, so they moved swiftly toward the timelessly old mountain.

"First stop the war!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke to everyone, gazing at the people of Tianyuan Sect. One person stood out unusually: it was Leng Qiuchan, the only one left from Luo Sheng Gate.

Leng Qiuchan had always been in Luo Sheng Gate, but now his face was grim. He hadn't participated in the battle.

"Sister, go. Don't worry, Luo Tian won't blame you!" Jiang Sici approached Leng Qiuchan and spoke to him.

On another side, two women with identical faces looked at each other: "Should we still fight?"

They both spoke at the same time, laughing lightly and moving toward each other. Their figures merged together.

Chapter 2811: Fighting Against Heaven()

Crack... The sound of breaking echoed in Luo Tian's ears, making him open his eyes and gaze at the seal containing Heaven's Divinity.

"Is it about to begin?" Luo Tian whispered, his eyes filled with battle spirit. This was a catastrophe that would be recorded in history. However, if they failed, the immortal realm would collapse, and there would be no history to record it, like in ancient times.

Boom... Under everyone's gaze, the massive barrier completely shattered. In an instant, Luo Tian and others flew up and rushed into the barrier.

A vast void appeared, boundless and endless, as if entering another world. A gray sky emitted a mighty pressure, making the Dark God and others look grim.

"We were too late. He's almost merged with Heaven!" The Dark God spoke, making everyone's faces grim.

"We didn't come too late. He hasn't fully merged yet!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, his eyes glowing with divine light. He pierced through the void and saw a figure sitting within it. The figure gradually faded but still existed.

"Kill..." Luo Tian roared, his aura surging wildly. He flew up and rushed toward the blood-red sky.

"Just a little more!" The illusory figure in the void spoke. It was Yang Huanyu, but his aura was extremely powerful.

"I'll destroy you all!" Yang Huanyu stood up and descended from the sky. With a single step, his illusory figure appeared, sending an overwhelming pressure that made Luo Tian's body suddenly stop.

Heavenly pressure spread and fell upon Luo Tian and the others, making their faces pale. This pressure was enough to suppress everything. Even though they were Emperors, they had to bow before this pressure.

"Although he hasn't fully merged, he has already become part of Heaven. Unless our cultivation can advance further!" The Dark God spoke.

Among those present, each was a supreme strength, the top few in the world. Yet now they felt powerless before Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu had transcended the human realm. Accurately speaking, he was a god, the ruler of nine heavens.

"Advancing further... Is Emperor not the peak?" Luo Tian asked, his eyes filled with disbelief upon hearing the Dark God's words.

"There is. In ancient times, there were three Emperors. Although they were called Emperors, their strength was far beyond true Emperors!"

"It was precisely because of the three Emperors that Heaven in ancient times suffered severe damage!" The Dark God spoke, but his voice carried bitterness.

Boom... A blood-red hand stretched across and pressed down, radiating the power to suppress everything. It felt like the heavens pressing down upon them, rushing toward Luo Tian and others.

The Dark God raised his hand. A black magic sword appeared in his hand, its blade reaching the heavens and radiating supreme Emperor's power. He slashed toward the massive hand.

The Lord of Divine Beasts formed an illusion with one hand and a divine seal with the other. Suddenly, they merged together, emitting destruction of heaven and earth's waves that rushed toward the massive hand. Others also launched nine powerful techniques, rushing toward the descending massive hand.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The thunderous roars echoed. The wild waves instantly struck Luo Tian and others, sending them flying. The void they were in was also shattered by this confrontation.

At the same time, the entire Mount Buzhi was struck by an invisible wave. Mountains crumbled under this wave.

Luo Tian and the nine people's blood and energy surged, but although this attack hadn't injured them, it had made them feel Yang Huanyu's terrifying power.

Mount Buzhi was gone!

At the same time, the Ten Heavens forces and Yaochen, Long Jie and others appeared at the entrance of Mount Buzhi. Seeing the scene of Mount Buzhi being reduced to ashes, their eyes showed intense shock.

……

A wave appeared. On the blood-red sky, a faint figure emerged as if it were a picture.

"Destroy!" A cold voice echoed. The massive illusory figure on the sky pressed down another hand toward Luo Tian and others.

"Otherwise, we will be crushed to death eventually!" The Dark God shouted. However, they had no good plan at this moment.

"Luo Tian, listen carefully to what I say. Among those present, only you have a chance to completely stop this catastrophe because you are the disciple of Gui Gu and also have cultivated the Heart Demon Great Scripture!" This time, the Dark God did not fight but spoke to Luo Tian. His voice was solemn.

"Take this illusion demon stone, and we will try our best to get the Gui Gu Seal for you!"

"Master the technique of controlling Heaven, and destroy this damned thing!" The Dark God did not wait for Luo Tian's response. He waved his hand, and a illusion demon stone appeared before Luo Tian.

After doing this, the Dark God left Luo Tian stunned and stood there. He flew up and rushed toward the illusory figure of Yang Huanyu.

"I am the Dark God. Today I will do something against Heaven. If successful, it is a blessing for all beings; if failed, all beings will perish!" The Dark God roared. His aura was overwhelming and transformed into a black cloud that surged toward the seemingly endless illusion, expanding to cover an entire world. At the same time, his voice echoed throughout nine heavens and ten lands, making all people in the immortal realm and hell look with shock.

"What's happening?" Everyone was stunned, but they had already guessed. News had arrived that the battlefield of Tianyuan Sect had been won.

"Heaven is unkind and wants to destroy the entire immortal realm. Do not fight among yourselves. Blood will become nourishment for Heaven, making it stronger!" The Dark God's words had just finished when Luo Tian shouted loudly. His voice echoed throughout nine heavens.

"Wow..." All the millions of cultivators in the world were terrified. Who was Luo Tian? An Emperor, there was no need to deceive such people. Moreover, this war had been strange.

Boom... Just as everyone was shocked, a thunderous roar echoed in their ears. Black clouds collided with the illusory figure and exploded violently.

The self-immolation of an Emperor, burning all his cultivation power, was enough to shake the heavens. Even if the opponent was Heaven itself!

Everyone in the immortal realm could clearly feel that their position's sky had been shaken, and blood rain fell.

"It's my turn!" At the same time, the Lord of Divine Beasts ascended through the heavens with a smile. He transformed into a divine light and rushed toward the illusion.

"Kid, quickly find all the illusion demon stones and fuse them together!" Gu Tianshu seemed to have known what would happen, spoke to Luo Tian.

"I..." Luo Tian didn't know what to say. He knew these elders were giving him time for the sake of it.

Chapter 2812: Illusion Demon World()

The Lord of Divine Beasts had never appeared before. No one knew what he had done in the immortal realm for so long, but his appearance as an Emperor was enough to show how astonishing he was.

A golden-black Taijitu covered the heavens and earth. It exploded above the illusion, making Yang Huanyu's illusory figure dim slightly.

"Up..." Longque, Gu Tianshu, Wang Duantian and others, as well as four half-Emperors from Ten Heavens who had arrived, all flew up.

"Ah..." Luo Tian watched several supreme strengths rush toward the illusion. He restrained his urge to go out and stood on top of Tianyuan Sect's people.

"Come..." Luo Tian extended his hand. The black necklaces hanging around the necks of Gu Qianxue, Jiang Sici, and Su Dan flew out and landed in Luo Tian's hands. There were five of them, still carrying the warmth of their owners.

Unseal! Luo Tian extended his hand. A crackling sound rose before him. Six dark lights appeared, hovering in front of Luo Tian. Adding the illusion demon stone given by the Dark God, there were six in total.

The six illusion demon stones fused instantly and radiated a soft black light, covering the sky. A cold atmosphere followed.

Luo Tian raised his hand and grabbed the illusion demon stone, which trembled violently in his hands. The magic energy surged.

"Come here!" Luo Tian roared, using the Emperor's power to suppress the illusion demon stone and pressed it into his forehead. A cold atmosphere enveloped Luo Tian's entire body, making him shiver involuntarily. The cold magic energy spread and a thought invaded Luo Tian's mind, attempting to control him.

"Go away..." Luo Tian roared. His Emperor's soul suppressed everything, and that cold thought was instantly subdued.

"Complete Heart Demon Cultivation!" Upon fusing the illusion demon stone, Luo Tian's mind instantly gained many techniques.

At the same time, the entire immortal realm began to tremble. Mountains collapsed and seas reversed, plunging into an apocalyptic state.

Emperor, the Dark God fell!

Emperor, the Lord of Divine Beasts fell!

Emperor, Jietian Leader fell!

Emperor, Gu Tianshu fell!

Several figures exploded in the sky and vanished completely. The attacks of Gu Tianshu and others, who sacrificed their lives, finally shattered the illusion.

"Is it over?" Everyone's faces were filled with sorrow. They watched the illusion vanish into the world, and the cost was indeed painful—several Emperors and half-Emperors had sacrificed their lives to destroy this illusion.

A golden light fell from the sky, making Luo Tian's eyes narrow slightly. He extended his hand and grabbed the golden token.

"It's not over yet..." Luo Tian whispered lowly. The Gui Gu Token radiated golden light, engraving the words "Gui Gu" on his back. The sky was illuminated.

The heavens trembled, and the blood-red sky roiled. A powerful pressure descended upon them, making all beings in the immortal realm tremble.

"Everyone, I need your cultivation power!"

"If you don't want to, you can refuse. However, if this battle is lost, all beings will die!" Luo Tian spoke to the people of Tianyuan Sect. His voice echoed throughout nine heavens and ten lands, his eyes filled with guilt. He could feel that a greater catastrophe was coming. He had to enhance his strength.

This was the only chance, given by the Dark God and others with their lives. Luo Tian must cherish it, so he had to be absolutely certain.

"Illusion Demon World!" Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly. A black demon moon rose, radiating supreme divine power and flying toward the sky.

Boom...

In an instant, the demon moon exploded violently, transforming into countless black streams of light that flew in all directions. The entire immortal realm was enveloped by dark magic light.

"I'll go!" Long Jie shouted and flew up, rushing toward a black stream.

"An Immortal King peak cannot stop this catastrophe. This cultivation level is useless!" Douzhan Sheng Fo, Yao Huangtian shouted and rushed toward a black stream. In an instant, the people of Tianyuan Sect all rushed toward the black streams without hesitation. Their bodies emitted a series of roaring sounds.

Eight ghost gates, the disciples of Tianyuan Sect also rushed without hesitation. When they were hit by the black streams, this movement caused other forces in the immortal realm to rush forward as well.

"We can't let the people of the immortal realm win!" In hell, someone shouted. At this critical moment, who cared about their own cultivation level? Even an Immortal King peak could not stop this catastrophe. What could they do?

Boom... A black demon seed flew out from Long Jie's body, and his aura immediately weakened.

"Come!" Luo Tian roared. His body radiated divine light, and the demon seeds rising from all corners of the world flew toward Luo Tian's direction.

Devour Heaven! Luo Tian opened his mouth and sucked in, causing the sky to twist. Each black demon seed was absorbed into his body.

As Luo Tian absorbed the demon seeds, the blood-red sky roiled again and seemed to descend.

"Luo Tian, you... can't beat me..." A voice filled with madness echoed. The voice was hoarse but Luo Tian still recognized it as Yang Huanyu's.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

Luo Tian ignored everything and continued to absorb the demon seeds. His imperial seal in his dantian rapidly absorbed the wild cultivation power.

Zhon... At the same time, a thunderous roar echoed throughout heaven and earth. The sky shattered.

Pu... This sound of roaring made everyone spit blood, with many beings directly shattering.

Luo Tian opened his eyes and gazed at the blood-red sky. In an instant, he strode through the heavens toward the blood-red sky.

Damn!

Luo Tian rushed out beyond the domain, seeing the scene outside the star fields. His heart trembled slightly.

A series of nebulae appeared, drifting toward the direction of the immortal realm. Each nebula was a small world.

"..."
