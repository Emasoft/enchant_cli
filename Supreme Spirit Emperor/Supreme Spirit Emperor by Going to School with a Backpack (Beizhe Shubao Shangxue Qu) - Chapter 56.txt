“‘It’s Luo Tian!’” Lan Yichen and others murmured in disbelief, their gazes filled with overwhelming astonishment.

None had expected Luo Tian to rise after enduring Ying Hongtu’s formidable attack. Such an assault would have overwhelmed even them, and even if Luo Tian’s flesh had turned to dust, he could not have risen again. Yet Luo Tian had done so, standing slowly amidst the stunned onlookers, his body emitting a crisp sound like firecrackers.

Luo Tian rose with a cold expression, his eyes casting a sharp glance at Ying Hongtu before letting out a light laugh: “You are truly formidable. I never expected you to have reached such strength in the Bone-Transcending Realm!”

“Hum…” The Splitting Heaven Spear seemed to heed its master’s call, materializing as a streak of black light in Luo Tian’s grasp.

At that moment, Luo Tian appeared quite battered—bloodstains clung to his lips, his chest clothing torn by the lightning dragon’s claws, revealing a lean yet powerful torso. Though slight in frame, one could sense the rising aura and formidable strength surging within his body.

“You truly are an unkillable pest!” Ying Hongtu’s eyes flickered with surprise, but it quickly faded into composure. After all, he knew Luo Tian’s secrets well. The bronze cauldron still stood in the furnace; he could not fathom what else Luo Tian might possess to continue their clash.

“Now it has only just begun! Though I would rather not enter this state, your current strength indeed warrants being my opponent!” Luo Tian wiped the blood from his lips, gazing at Ying Hongtu with a detached expression.

“You have no right to speak thus. You are but a desperate foe; stop posturing!” Ying Hongtu’s gaze held disdain, yet his mind was deeply wary. He dared not underestimate this young man whose name was Luo Tian.

“Very well, let you witness my ultimate state!” Luo Tian said coldly, his right hand—marked with the Nirvana Dragon Seal—holding a golden scale.

At the moment the golden scale appeared in Luo Tian’s grasp, Baihu, locked in battle with an automaton, shuddered violently. He sensed the overwhelming aura of a beast-destroying scale and gazed in surprise at Luo Tian’s golden scale.

Others felt no difference from the scale nor any immense pressure, but knowing it was held by Luo Tian, they understood its significance.

Luo Tian extended his right hand marked with the Nirvana Dragon Seal, a faint smile on his face: “Little one, I truly did not wish to awaken you. But now I have a problem.”

Ignoring the onlookers’ gazes, Luo Tian gently placed the golden scale upon the Nirvana Dragon Seal, his expression now solemn.

“Roar…” As the golden scale met the Nirvana Dragon Seal, a thunderous roar echoed across Wen Tian City. All within it trembled in fear.

The roar was followed by a radiant light column rising from Luo Tian’s wrist, piercing the heavens.

“Dragon aura! What is that scale?!” Rong Da stared in shock, his voice trembling as Bai Tian exclaimed.

“This is no aura of a land dragon or flying dragon. It’s the true Dragon Clan!” Rong Da’s face was grave.

“Even a Dragon Clan scale cannot emit such dense dragon aura! Could it be…” The two exchanged glances, recalling a legendary item of the Dragon Clan.

“Reverse Scale!” Ying Hongtu’s face showed shock, his voice trembling.

“How could Luo Tian possess such a thing? Isn’t the reverse scale of the Dragon Emperor something only granted once in a lifetime, and considered a precious treasure?” Hearing their murmurs, Lan Yichen and others also gasped in surprise.

Indeed, the scale in Luo Tian’s hand was a reverse scale of the Dragon Emperor—more specifically, one from the current Dragon Emperor, Lord Longjian, who possessed only one such scale.

Previously, Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping had ventured into the Great An Forest to seek a method of breaking the Nirvana Dragon Seal, enabling Luo Tian’s advancement into the Bone-Transcending Realm. They had given up hope until Lord Longjian, with his extraordinary power, granted Luo Tian a minute of access to the Nirvana Dragon Seal. This allowed Luo Tian’s successful advancement into the Bone-Transcending Realm.

Even with Lord Longjian’s strength, it had only lasted a minute. After that, Luo Tian’s cultivation returned to the ninth level of Body Transcending.

Yet, having entered the Bone-Transcending Realm, Luo Tian’s bone had been inscribed, marking his entry into the realm. As long as he activated the Nirvana Dragon Seal, he would become a Bone-Transcending Realm cultivator.

Thus, Lord Longjian had gifted Luo Tian his precious reverse scale. After all, Luo Tian could not remain indefinitely in the Great An Forest. The reverse scale functioned like a key, granting access to the Nirvana Dragon Seal for one minute. During this time, not only would Dragon Baby awaken, but Luo Tian would also enter the Bone-Transcending Realm with maximum combat power.

“Roar…” A second roar echoed, and a golden dragon emerged from the light column, circling before transforming into a child’s form.

“Ah…” A long yawn echoed from the child, who looked around before pointing a tiny finger. The golden light column shattered instantly, and a red-clothed child fell from the sky.

“Plop…” A heavy sound echoed, splitting the stone ground beneath.

When Lan Yichen and Leng Yulong saw the child’s form, their bodies trembled. They repeatedly rubbed their eyes, faces filled with disbelief as they whispered: “Dragon Baby!”

Chapter 272: The Powerful Dragon Baby

Chapter 272: The Powerful Dragon Baby

As Dragon Baby landed, he noticed the stunned crowd around him. His face bore a naive expression as he approached Luo Tian, saying in a childish voice: “Big brother, sugar!”

Luo Tian smiled at Dragon Baby’s endearing demeanor, producing several pills and offering them: “Dragon Baby, be good. See that fellow over there? He’s the toy I found for you!” Luo Tian pointed at the blue automaton battling Baihu.

At that moment, Baihu struggled. It felt Dragon Baby’s terrifying aura over beasts, reducing its strength by a third and making it struggle against the automaton.

Following Luo Tian’s finger, Dragon Baby saw Baihu and the blue automaton. A childish smile spread across his face as he munched on the pills, speaking incoherently: “That little white cat is so cute. Can I have it?”

“White cat?” Hearing Dragon Baby’s name, Baihu nearly stumbled, narrowly dodging the automaton’s attack. A wry smile crossed its face.

The crowd heard Dragon Baby’s words and grimaced. The formidable Baihu, a Bone-Transcending Realm mid-level cultivator, was now called “little cat” by this endearing child.

Those who had seen Dragon Baby before understood his terrifying power and dared not speak, fearing Dragon Baby’s gaze.

“Don’t give it to you. When you stop sleeping, I’ll give it to you!” Luo Tian spoke as if soothing a child.

“Okay! Mom said I should listen to big brother. Big brother, why are you bleeding? Tell me who did it! I’ll beat him for you!” Dragon Baby waved his tiny fists, shouting loudly.

Hearing Dragon Baby’s boastful manner, the crowd smiled despite being shorter than their waists.

“Just smash that blue iron thing!” Luo Tian patted Dragon Baby’s head, again pointing at the blue automaton.

“Okay!” Dragon Baby nodded, slowly approaching the blue Bone-Transcending Realm mid-level automaton.

“You! You came to bully my big brother, right? I’ll teach you a lesson!” Dragon Baby crossed his arms, swaying his tiny bottom.

As Dragon Baby approached, Baihu’s strength dropped another third. Its body trembled and lay prostrate on the ground, unable to move under Dragon Baby’s terrifying aura.

“Little cat! Don’t be afraid. I’ll protect you!” Dragon Baby gently patted Baihu’s head.

But he forgot that the automaton was still attacking Baihu. Standing before Baihu, it naturally absorbed the attack.

The blue automaton’s thick arm slammed down on Dragon Baby’s head. Some could not bear to witness the bloody scene and closed their eyes, unwilling to see this adorable child crushed.

“Plop… Oh, it hurts!” A heavy sound echoed as Dragon Baby’s childish voice followed.

The blue automaton’s arm struck Dragon Baby’s head, causing cracks to spread across the stone ground beneath.

The crowd stared in disbelief at Dragon Baby, who appeared unharmed.

At that moment, Dragon Baby touched his round head and glared angrily.

“I didn’t hit you. Why did you hit me? I’m really angry!” Dragon Baby shouted at the blue automaton.

But the automaton could not understand him. Its thick arm slammed down again.

“You hit me again! I’m angry!” Dragon Baby raised his tiny fist and punched the blue automaton’s arm.

“Plop…” No aura fluctuation. In people’s widening mouths, the blue automaton flew backward like lightning, crashing into the city lord’s wall. The wall was shattered without slowing down.

“Ah! I broke the wall! Will I have to pay for it? I need to stop it quickly, or it’ll break more!” Dragon Baby exclaimed, kicking off the ground and chasing the blue automaton that kept smashing buildings.

The crowd watched in terror as the small figure vanished like a whirlwind, their faces filled with shock.

In three breaths, Dragon Baby reappeared in people’s sight, holding the blue automaton with his tiny hands—seemingly mismatched with his small frame.

“Plop…” Dragon Baby threw the blue automaton to the ground, shouting loudly. His tiny body leaped high.

Seeing this action, Luo Tian’s lips twitched. Lan Yichen and Leng Yulong also had twitching mouths; they knew what Dragon Baby’s jump meant. Luo Tian himself had experienced it before.

Another thunderous sound echoed into people’s ears as Dragon Baby’s body, like a mountain, crushed the blue automaton to pieces.

Dragon Baby clapped his hands and grabbed Baihu’s tail, dragging it toward Luo Tian. “Big brother, done! How many walls did I break? You’ll pay for it later!”

Luo Tian handed Dragon Baby several pills, saying softly: “Alright, take Baihu and play. I’ll handle the rest. It’s been a while since you came out!”

“Okay!” Dragon Baby nodded, beginning to torment Baihu under its reluctant gaze.

The crowd’s faces bore fear as they watched this terrifying child. Ying Hongtu was stunned, gazing at his Bone-Transcending Realm mid-level automaton with a heart-wrenching expression. He dared not speak, for Dragon Baby was too terrifying—just one punch had shattered his automaton. No one in the crowd could achieve this.

People confirmed even Bone-Transcending Realm late-stage or peak-level cultivators couldn’t do this. After all, automata relied on their hard bodies and lack of pain sense. Yet Dragon Baby had crushed it with a single butt!

“Luo Tian, won’t you let him fight me?” Ying Hongtu’s face trembled as he watched Dragon Baby tormenting Baihu.

Hearing Ying Hongtu’s words, the crowd’s gazes grew solemn. Luo Tian was still Luo Tian; with Dragon Baby alone, he could walk through the Bone-Transcending Realm.

Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, his voice cold: “You? Not even close. One of me is enough. I’ll use you to test my ultimate state!”

His aura changed abruptly, becoming agile. It felt as if a gate had opened within his body, with energy radiating from it.

Chapter 273: Bone-Transcending Realm

Under people’s astonished gazes, Luo Tian’s cultivation surged like a geyser. His bones glowed with five colors.

“Bone-Transcending Realm?” People trembled, their hearts shaking. They felt regret for coming to trouble Luo Tian.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu’s faces lit up with joy. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have advanced into the Bone-Transcending Realm.

“Not Bone-Transcending Realm early stage. His aura is still rising, about to break into the mid-stage!” Someone in the crowd shouted.

Ying Hongtu’s face turned pale. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have entered the Bone-Transcending Realm, let alone mid-stage. Previously, he had mocked and pressured Luo Tian with his early stage strength. Now, Luo Tian had surpassed him by one level!

As people were stunned, Luo Tian’s cultivation halted at the mid-stage. He felt his powerful strength and was entranced.

Indeed, Luo Tian had entered the Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage. The seal broken during his breakthrough released all the sealed cultivation he had accumulated in the Great An Forest, instantly propelling him from Body Transcending ninth level to Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage.

He clenched his fists, producing a crisp sound. His gaze was playful as he looked at Ying Hongtu: “Come on, you wanted to challenge me!”

Ying Hongtu gazed at Luo Tian’s formidable strength and wore a bitter expression. How could he fight now? He knew Luo Tian’s physique, and had only dared to challenge him under the assumption he was Body Transcending ninth level. If he had known Luo Tian could enter the Bone-Transcending Realm, he would never have dared to challenge him. He cursed those who had spread the rumor that Luo Tian couldn’t enter the Bone-Transcending Realm and those who had informed him of Luo Tian’s presence in Wen Tian City.

Not only Ying Hongtu, but all those who had come to challenge Luo Tian were cursing the person who told them about his presence in Wen Tian City.

Feeling the change in people’s gazes, Luo Tian smiled slightly. He knew they were intimidated but his eyes held coldness, silently sighing: “Though intimidating, it’s not enough!”

Thinking this, Luo Tian’s lips curled into a cruel arc. His body moved, five-colored energy swirling around him. In an instant, he appeared before Ying Hongtu, his fists of five-colored energy carrying immense destructive power and slamming toward Ying Hongtu.

Feeling the terrifying pressure from Luo Tian’s fists, stronger than before by more than double, Ying Hongtu had already been scared out of his wits. He dared not confront it and vanished in a thunderous sound.

Luo Tian’s fist struck the city lord’s wall, re-inflicting damage on the previously shattered wall. Dozens of feet long, it collapsed, revealing everything inside the city lord’s premises.

“Running fast! I had a great time hitting you!” Luo Tian smiled as he saw Ying Hongtu dozens of feet away.

Before his words ended, the Heaven-Defying Step was activated. His body vanished instantly, leaving behind afterimages and appearing before Ying Hongtu. Having entered the Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage, Luo Tian’s body could now fully withstand the second step of the Heaven-Defying Step. Especially over such a short distance.

Ying Hongtu dodged Luo Tian’s fist, his heart still racing. Luo Tian’s body reappeared before him, a terrifying fist carrying the will to shatter everything and slamming into Ying Hongtu’s chest.

Ying Hongtu’s heart seemed to stop for a moment. His Bone-Transcending Realm early stage body emitted a crackling sound, resembling the blue automaton’s fate!

But it didn’t break through too many walls. Only a section of the city lord’s wall collapsed, causing Zhang Hongyun’s family to scream.

Ying Hongtu coughed blood. Before he could catch his breath, he felt darkness and a massive foot slammed onto his face.

“Is this even human!” People stared in shock at Luo Tian, their faces filled with overwhelming disbelief.

“Without using bone essence or martial arts, relying solely on his body and energy to defeat a Bone-Transcending Realm early stage genius in two moves! Luo Tian is beyond limits!” People shouted in their hearts.

Rong Da and Bai Zhan tian’s faces bore bitter smiles. They watched Ying Hongtu, who had been stepped on by Luo Tian, and secretly thanked their luck. They were glad Ying Hongtu had acted first; if they had, it might have been them under Luo Tian’s foot.

“Do you think I dare to kill you?” Luo Tian lifted his foot, grabbed Ying Hongtu with one hand, and glared at him with cold killing intent. Ying Hongtu had reached Luo Tian’s limit.

Ying Hongtu’s face was pale to the extreme. He had come to crush Luo Tian, but now he was crushed under his feet again. Having fought three times with Luo Tian, the first time he had been driven back, the second time he had paid three drops of blood and a massive debt of energy stones. The third was even worse, being stepped on in front of his peers.

Thinking about the humiliation, Ying Hongtu coughed up more blood and nearly fainted.

“Ask me, and I’ll let you go!” Luo Tian threw Ying Hongtu before the crowd. His voice echoed in their ears as if speaking to everyone.

Hearing Luo Tian’s unmistakable cold killing intent, the crowd trembled. Their gazes at Luo Tian carried a hint of fear.

“Hum…” The Splitting Heaven Spear joyfully returned to Luo Tian’s hand, emitting a provocative aura toward the crowd.

Ying Hongtu felt Luo Tian’s unmistakable cold killing intent and looked ashen. His eyes had no light, losing the initial arrogance.

“I beg you, don’t kill me!” Ying Hongtu spoke mechanically, using his last strength to utter the words.

Hearing Ying Hongtu’s words, the crowd also changed faces. They knew Ying Hongtu had a mental block and would no longer have a chance to compete with Luo Tian. Worse still, Luo Tian had become a mental block in Ying Hongtu’s heart, rooting itself and preventing any major achievements in his future martial arts path. The only way to resolve this mental block was to defeat Luo Tian. But looking at the formidable Luo Tian, they didn’t believe Ying Hongtu could do it.

Feeling his remaining time to break the seal was short, Luo Tian swept over the crowd with no emotion: “In ten breaths, leave Wen Tian City!”

Chapter 274: The Hidden Sect of the Corpse Emperor

Seeing Luo Tian’s unmistakable killing intent, the crowd trembled and felt a desire to leave. At this moment, Luo Tian seemed like a demon, instilling fear in the crowd.

Three breaths passed. Some with no grudge against Luo Tian quietly left, faces filled with fear.

Six breaths: Lan Yichen and others walked together, stepping out of Wen Tian City’s gate.

Nine breaths: Rong Da and Bai Zhan tian looked deeply at Luo Tian before walking out of the gate. Only Ying Hongtu remained.

“What about him?” One person glanced at Ying Hongtu, who lay on the ground with dim eyes, and asked Luo Tian in a low voice.

“Take what you can. If not, throw him out!” Luo Tian stood up and took Ying Hongtu’s storage bag, handing it to Zhang Huiyang, who was still in shock.

“Uncle, this is compensation for your wall!” Luo Tian smiled.

“This!” Zhang Huiyang held Ying Hongtu’s storage bag, his face filled with shock. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so generous. Ying Hongtu was a prodigy of the Thunder Sect, and his storage bag must contain many treasures.

But seeing Luo Tian’s terrifying strength, Zhang Huiyang’s gaze changed. His eyes carried a hint of respect.

“Father, take it. This guy is a cultivator; he’s rich!” Zhang Hongyun saw his father’s hesitation and smiled, approaching Zhang Huiyang.

The surrounding Zhang family members looked at the three with strong respect. They could feel these young men were far beyond their image of Zhang Huiyang, who was like a god to them.

Zhang Huiyang said nothing. He carefully stored Ying Hongtu’s storage bag and ordered people to do their tasks, repairing the surrounding walls.

Luo Tian took a deep breath, smiling slightly. He turned to call Dragon Baby over but his lips twitched.

At this moment, Baihu was no longer the proud and fierce creature it once was. It truly looked like a little cat, its face filled with resentment as it gazed at Dragon Baby.

At this moment, Baihu’s white fur had fallen everywhere. Luo Tian didn’t know why Dragon Baby had such a habit of pulling out hair, perhaps because he was used to pulling the black tiger’s fur. After being sealed for so long, it had finally come out and met Baihu. How could he resist? He sat on Baihu’s back, his eyes glowing as he continuously pulled out the fur.

Feeling Baihu’s desperate gaze, Luo Tian smiled. Dragon Baby, are you done playing? Time is almost up!

“Oh! Okay! Little cat, I’ll come back to play next time!” Dragon Baby jumped from Baihu’s back and approached Luo Tian.

“Big brother, let me come out more often next time!” Dragon Baby spoke, his innocent eyes filled with reluctance.

“Okay. I’ll call you out whenever there’s an opportunity!” Luo Tian nodded, feeling pity. Who could bear to keep a child locked in sleep for years?

“Okay! Let me go to sleep. I feel kind of sleepy.” Dragon Baby yawned, stretching his tiny body.

“Okay!” Luo Tian sighed softly. He extended his hand and reluctantly took the dragon scale from his wrist. He knew even if he didn’t remove it, after a minute, the scale would fall off by itself.

Removing the scale, waves of sealing power radiated again. Dragon Baby’s body was covered with runes. However, he felt no pain now, as the success of the Nirvana Dragon Seal had established a connection between him and the seal.

Dragon Baby waved goodbye to everyone playfully, his gaze looking at Baihu as he kept shouting: “Little cat! I’ll come back next time!”

In the crowd’s speechless gaze, Dragon Baby shrank continuously, turning into a streak of golden light that entered the seal on Luo Tian’s wrist.

The golden light had just faded when Luo Tian’s cultivation rapidly declined, compressed by the seal again.

“Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage… Bone-Transcending Realm early stage…”

“Body Transcending ninth level!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, sighing softly.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu wore expressions of helplessness. They had intended to take Luo Tian out for a break, but instead, he had no problems and had even advanced into the Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage. This left them embarrassed.

“Truly a heart-stirring power!” Feeling the difference between his current strength and that of Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage, Luo Tian felt a surge of irritation.

“Luo Tian, you did well! I never expected you to hide so deeply. We were worried for a long time!” Zhang Hongyun patted Luo Tian’s shoulder with a smile.

Feng Qianyu was also excited. They had thought Luo Tian could only stay at Body Transcending ninth level, but he had already surpassed everyone else to reach Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage.

“If I hadn’t hidden it, how could I intimidate these bastards!” Luo Tian’s face was dark, his voice cold.

Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping had kept it secret from everyone, even from Lu Kunpeng. They wanted to take this opportunity to intimidate these newly entered Bone-Transcending Realm geniuses. After all, Luo Tian had only been in the Bone-Transcending Realm for a minute. If others came looking for trouble later, he couldn’t bear it.

“Let’s go inside and talk!” Zhang Huiyang finished everything and approached the three.

Under Zhang Hongyun’s warm hospitality, Luo Tian stayed in Wen Tian City for two days. The three then left the city and traveled through various cities, searching for the traces of the Corpse Emperor Sect.

However, it was strange that after Luo Tian defeated various sect disciples in Wen Tian City, the event had not spread. It seemed as if several sects had sealed it, keeping silent.

The three walked boldly through various cities without hiding from the Corpse Emperor Sect. Knowing that the Corpse Emperor Sect was currently being hunted by various sects, but still targeting the Five Elements Sect. The three dared to walk openly in such a dangerous situation. People couldn’t help but guess what their strength was.

That day, the three walked into a small city. Upon entering, they wore angry expressions. Two black-cloaked Corpse Emperor Sect masters were attacking the city’s people, blood mist filling the air and being absorbed by a crimson pearl in the sky.

Chapter 275: Attraction

Luo Tian, Zhang Hongyun, and Feng Qianyu glared angrily. Especially Feng Qianyu, who roared and charged toward the two Bone-Transcending Realm early stage Corpse Emperor Sect masters slaughtering ordinary people.

Luo Tian and Zhang Hongyun also flew after them, their faces filled with anger. They rushed toward another Corpse Emperor Sect master.

Two Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage masters in black cloaks were ruthlessly slaughtering the city’s men, women, and children. Their eyes glowed with bloodlust.

“Haha! Our soul-summoning pearl will be small now. We’ll surely receive a lot of rewards from the sect!”
“Indeed! Then we two will enter Bone-Transcending Realm late stage. Let’s finish quickly. Recently, the sects in the northern domain have been active frequently. We mustn’t be discovered by other sects!” The second master said, his face showing a serious reminder.

“Please, save my child!” A common woman knelt before the two Corpse Emperor Sect masters, begging desperately.
“Die!” The middle-aged master kicked her with no effort, using only his Bone-Transcending Realm body strength to kick her to death.
Like crushing an ant, the two masters continued chasing the fleeing crowd. Their Bone-Transcending Realm aura instantly compressed the people, preventing them from moving.
“We’ll fight back!” Several middle-aged men with Body Transcending second or third levels rushed toward them.
“Don’t be foolish! Don’t resist uselessly!” Body Transcending second or third levels were considered strong in the city, but they were too weak compared to Bone-Transcending Realm masters!
Within a breath, these middle-aged men became corpses.
The slaughter continued. The two masters acted like killing machines, walking through the crowd and causing several people to fall in blood. The red blood was absorbed into the soul-summoning pearl above.
While they were enjoying their slaughter, out of caution, the two masters’ mid-stage spiritual awareness remained outwardly extended.
Suddenly sensing three powerful auras in their spiritual awareness, the two masters were stunned. They smiled and stopped.
Feng Qianyu took a step forward, appearing before the two masters in an instant and launching a punch.
“Plop…” A heavy sound echoed. One master took several steps back, his face showing surprise. He hadn’t expected the aura of a Bone-Transcending Realm early stage master sensed in his spiritual awareness to be so powerful.
The other master, seeing his companion being pushed back by a Bone-Transcending Realm early stage youth, also showed a serious expression. His gaze fell on Feng Qianyu and noticed the two types of energy radiating from him, his face revealing understanding.
“Ah! So you are a two-element genius. That’s why you’re so strong!” The pushed-back master shook his numb arm, a playful look in his eyes as he gazed at Feng Qianyu.
These geniuses were what they loved most. Their strong bodies could be cultivated into corpses, and their blood was even stronger than that of the city’s people.
Wind blew. Luo Tian and Zhang Hongyun appeared before the three, seeing the two Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage masters. Luo Tian’s face was shocked and he murmured: “It’s you!”
“Luo Tian?” The two masters wore confusion, but soon their faces showed joy. They were the two Corpse Emperor Sect masters who had previously chased Luo Tian and forced him to use the second step of Heaven-Defying Step.
“Why are you here? It’s really a case of enemies meeting!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, but his expression was cold.
“Indeed! It’s really a case of enemies meeting!” The two masters gazed at Luo Tian, their spiritual awareness imprinted on the black badge on their waists. A light smile appeared on their faces.
They had been moved by the reward announced by the Corpse Emperor Sect. Their spiritual awareness imprinted on the black badge, and Luo Tian’s lips curled into a barely noticeable smile.
As the black-cloaked masters imprinted their spiritual awareness, all Corpse Emperor Sect masters in the northern domain—ranging from Yuanling to Body Transcending levels—gazed with excitement.
“Luo Tian! Five Elements body. The headquarters has ordered us to capture Luo Tian! There’s a huge reward!” Corpse Emperor Sect masters roared, rushing toward the location mentioned by the master.
“Luo Tian! It’s been a while. I heard you were stuck in Body Transcending and couldn’t get out. Do you know how surprised I am to see you?” A black-cloaked Li Xiuping sat cross-legged in a cave, his body surrounded by blood mist. His face bore a sinister expression.
“Finally appeared! If you had stayed in the Five Elements Sect, we really wouldn’t have known what to do!” A Corpse Emperor Sect Yuanling master sighed softly. His blood-red energy formed a pair of large wings behind him, and he flew toward the town. This man was the head of the northern domain branch of the Corpse Emperor Sect and a sect elder. He had previously led Li Xiuping and others to escape from Feiyun Sect.
“Kid, I never expected you to come out so boldly! You really don’t know when to die! Do you know we’ve made the northern domain like this just to lure you out? You really are not smart!” The master said with a sneer, gazing at Luo Tian.
Luo Tian saw the confident smile on the master’s face and wore a nonchalant expression. They had previously chased him like a lost dog, and now it was time for revenge!
Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the two masters’ eyes showed joy. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to actively challenge them instead of running away. Since they had previously let Luo Tian escape from their grasp, the two masters returned to their northern domain base and were scolded. From then on, the Corpse Emperor Sect’s northern branch issued an order: anyone who found Luo Tian must report immediately. Just delaying Luo Tian was enough!
At this moment, Luo Tian clearly wanted to fight them. Although Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu made them wary, they were confident in delaying for a while.
“Luo Tian, you’re seeking death. We’ll grant it!” The master’s mind sneered but his body assumed a defensive stance.
“Roar…” Luo Tian said no more and released Baihu.
As Baihu appeared, seeing the two masters, his tiger eyes first showed surprise before letting out a furious roar. Naturally recognizing them as the Corpse Emperor Sect masters who had previously chased him to nowhere, Baihu gazed at them with hatred.
“Roar…” Baihu roared and rushed toward the masters.
“Kill!” Luo Tian, Feng Qianyu, and others also roared and rushed toward the other master.
Chapter 276: Crimson Town

In an unknown town.

Thunderous sounds kept rising in the town. Luo Tian and his companions surrounded a Corpse Emperor Sect Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage master. Five elements of energy intertwined in the air.

The Corpse Emperor Sect master was surrounded by blood mist. A Bone-Transcending Realm early stage corpse appeared beside him, distracting Luo Tian.

Baihu fought the other Corpse Emperor Sect Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage master alone. His tiger face was full of anger, his body like a white lightning bolt attacking the Corpse Emperor Sect master’s surroundings, making him look desperate.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu were both two-element geniuses, their strength approaching Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage. With a sword and staff, they carried overwhelming power, also making the Bone-Transcending Realm mid-stage master look desperate.

Compared to others, Luo Tian had it the easiest. With a Splitting Heaven Spear, he constantly suppressed the Bone-Transcending Realm early stage Corpse Emperor Sect master. Winning was just a matter of time.

Meanwhile, the town’s residents had been terrified and fled outside. The town seemed empty, with only bloodstains flowing on the ground—blood from the previous townspeople. The two Corpse Emperor Sect masters hadn’t yet absorbed them into their soul-summoning pearl, but were interrupted by the three.
