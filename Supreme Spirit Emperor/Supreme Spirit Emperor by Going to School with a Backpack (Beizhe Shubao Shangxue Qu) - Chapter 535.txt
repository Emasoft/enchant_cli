“Hum……” Before Luo Tian could react, a massive black hand suddenly appeared beside him and seized him in an iron grip.

Luo Tian’s heart jolted, but he forcibly suppressed his urge to resist, as he sensed no intent of killing.

The hand clutched Luo Tian and ruthlessly pressed him onto the altar, then transformed into black mist, surging into his dantian with relentless force.

“This…!” Luo Tian’s face darkened instantly as a wave of demonic energy surged into his dantian without hesitation.

“This is demonic energy!” Luo Tian’s mind roared, though he knew a method to refine it. But this amount was overwhelming—refining it would take at least one or two years.

Yet the demonic energy gave him no chance, relentlessly gathering in his dantian, causing a series of crackling sounds from within.

“Hum……” Just as Luo Tian felt despair, a black shadow coalesced beside him. The form was intangible yet radiated an overwhelming celestial authority, shaking Luo Tian’s spirit.

The shadow possessed no consciousness, merely performing hand seals beside Luo Tian. Its transparent body pulsed with faint demonic energy, as if channeling a flow of power.

“It’s teaching me these hand seals!” Even a fool would understand the shadow’s intent, and Luo Tian had already formed suspicions about its identity.

“This is too domineering! He didn’t even ask if I wanted it—refuse and I’d die!” Luo Tian muttered bitterly, surprised that even after his enlightenment, the Earth Store King remained as domineering.

Yet from the rule outside the pillar—those who killed most could enter—he deduced the Earth Store King must have been eccentric in life.

In the eyes of most celestial beings, hellish cultivators were often seen as eccentric, bloodthirsty, and allied with ghosts. Many, like Luo Tian before, believed hell was merely a realm of ghosts.

Luo Tian dared not waste time; he didn’t know how many times the shadow would perform the seals, so he focused on memorizing each gesture.

“Hum……” Luo Tian’s hands moved rapidly, waves of energy radiating from them. As he practiced the seals, the dense demonic energy within him calmed, no longer raging—though it hadn’t yet flowed freely, it at least removed the threat of explosion.

Time passed slowly. Half a day later, Luo Tian finally mastered his first seal. As he executed it, his third eye (印堂穴) emitted a powerful suction.

“Roar……” The demonic energy was instantly absorbed, condensing as if sealed within his third eye.

“Hundred Ghost Sealing!” After half a day, the shadow completed its sequence of seals. It began again from the start.

“Hundred and Eight Seals—each one binds demonic energy into a specific major acupoint, forming a cycle within my body. From now on, it will naturally absorb demonic energy to enhance my cultivation!” Luo Tian murmured, understanding the seals’ purpose.

“But I’m a celestial cultivator!” He then frowned bitterly—the Earth Store King’s Hundred Ghost Sealing, though powerful, seemed useless for celestial disciples.

At the same time, one hundred and eight palaces each had a figure seated on their altars. Some bore ecstatic expressions, while others mirrored Luo Tian’s grimace.

“No choice but to cultivate! If we don’t, the demonic energy will burst us!” Though grim, cultivators had no option but to grit their teeth and refine.

Chapter 2051: Eighteen ()

In the Earth Store King’s Palace, one hundred and eight palaces each had a figure seated on their altars. These individuals were among the elite of Bountiful Heaven City and the Gate of Hell, each renowned.

Now, one hundred and eight figures sat on their altars, bodies wreathed in demonic energy. All were closed-eyed, hands moving rapidly as strange hand seals formed from their palms.

“This Hundred Ghost Sealing is too difficult!” Almost everyone, including Luo Tian, felt the method was exceptionally arduous. Though the seals seemed simple, their actual execution was awkward and unyielding.

“Hum……” A black vortex pulsed on Luo Tian’s shoulder—his fourth major acupoint had opened.

“Three days to open four acupoints—how’s the speed?” Luo Tian marveled, noting that a day ago, the shadow had vanished. He’d memorized all one hundred and eight seals.

These three days, he’d attempted to avoid practicing the Hundred Ghost Sealing but found that without it, the demonic energy would erupt.

What Luo Tian didn’t know was that opening four acupoints in three days was already fast—others had only opened two.

Luo Tian’s speed stemmed from his experience in the Nine Domains, surpassing both Bountiful Heaven City and hellish cultivators. Yet as the last to enter the palace, he lagged slightly behind others. Still, given time, he could eventually overtake them.

“Boom!” A crisp sound echoed from Luo Tian’s body as his eighteenth acupoint suddenly opened.

With the opening of his eighteenth acupoint, all one hundred and eight figures in the palaces trembled. Their hearts tightened instantly.

“Only those who open all one hundred and eight acupoints first may enter the true inheritance. Those who fail… perish!” Most felt this unspoken truth, their hearts quaking.

This belief was unquestioned—after all, the Earth Store King had tested them by killing most.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, knowing the palace held not just early-stage immortals but also late-stage and peak-level masters. He had no chance of ranking among the top eighteen.

He also didn’t know if his speed was fast or slow compared to others, nor whether he’d made the top eighteen.

Not just Luo Tian, but all felt this way—only by opening acupoints furiously could they hope to enter the top eighteen and proceed.

Instantly, all one hundred and eight figures rushed to refine the seals.

The first to open eighteen acupoints was Xue Mian, his body seated calmly. As the thought arose, a mirror of ice materialized before him, reflecting his image and boosting his refinement speed.

The second was a youth who had slaughtered all in the space previously, his face carrying a faint smile.

“Luo Tian, I never thought we’d meet this way… millennia later, perhaps this is fate. This life, I won’t lose!” The youth’s eyes held coldness as he waved his hands, releasing a small black figure from his dantian.

Like Luo Tian, the youth was at the threshold of immortality but radiated far greater power. A celestial king would be stunned—his aura hinted at the ultimate realm, needing only one step to reach it.

Unlike Luo Tian, who hesitated over merging two ultimate immortal souls, the youth had already fused two. He needed only one more to ascend to the ultimate realm.

People would admire his audacity—without finding an ultimate immortal soul, he’d remain a threshold cultivator forever.

Ultimate immortal souls were rare; even Luo Tian dared not fuse two.

Others also unleashed their methods, frantically refining the Hundred Ghost Seals.

Luo Tian’s initial speed could have caught up, but as others employed their tricks, he fell behind again.

“This won’t work—I definitely won’t be in the top few!”

“I don’t want to either! I just want to safely return Ye Chen!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly.

Since entering the palace, he’d been hunted, then his head mysteriously increased—hunted again, then inexplicably entered the palace. Now he was forced to desperately refine the Hundred Ghost Seals.

“Fight! I won’t let my experience be outdone!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with madness as he waved his hands, sending waves of light from them.

“Everything becomes life; grass and trees become soldiers!” Luo Tian slammed his hands onto the altar, and medicinal herbs sprouted rapidly, their vitality enveloping him.

“To refine quickly, one must fully immerse themselves. The unity of heaven and man is the best method! Though I can’t enter this state like Zhan Biao, if I calm my mind, the possibility remains!” Luo Tian sat cross-legged, smiling as he gently touched a nearby herb.

“Hum……” A serene aura radiated from Luo Tian, the space falling silent except for his hands.

Time passed slowly. A month later, all figures refined at breakneck speed.

“Hundred and Eight Acupoints Opened!” Xue Mian roared, his final acupoint bursting open.

“Boom…” A crisp sound echoed from Xue Mian’s dantian, and one hundred and eight black vortices erupted in unison.

“Unsurpassed by the Earth Store King! Though this Hundred Ghost Sealing doesn’t enhance my cultivation, it grants me a new technique. If all one hundred and eight acupoints are opened, releasing this demonic energy could threaten even a threshold immortal king!” Xue Mian marveled.

At the same time, waves of energy rose from the altars. Xue Mian’s body vanished into the altar.

“Someone has opened all one hundred and eight acupoints! Mastered the Hundred Ghost Seals!” As Xue Mian disappeared, the other one hundred and seven palaces reacted instantly.

“Damn it! I’ve only opened eighty-something acupoints!” Someone panicked, their haste worsening their speed.

“Haha! I’ll see who’s ahead of me!” A burly man slammed his hands onto the ground, a thunderous sound echoing. Black mist swirled around him—his one hundred and eight acupoints had opened.

“How fast! Have we no chance?” As the man entered second, all trembled.

Everyone redoubled their efforts, desperate not to be last.

Yet as others frenzied, Luo Tian sat on the black altar, his hands shifting rapidly. If anyone were here, they’d be stunned by his speed.

At this moment, Luo Tian needed only twenty or so attempts to refine the true seal. Though twenty seems many, he’d previously required two thousand attempts.

Now, only twenty acupoints had vortices—meaning he’d learned just over twenty seals in a month.

Twenty attempts, and suddenly one acupoint burst open, adding another black vortex to his body.

Refining again, this time Luo Tian completed it in under a quarter-hour, using fewer than twenty attempts.

“Eighteen… ten…” As time passed, when fifty acupoints opened, Luo Tian’s aura vanished entirely, replaced by a series of thunderous sounds.

“Two!” If someone were here, they’d be speechless—Luo Tian had mastered the correct seal in just two attempts. His speed was terrifying.

Boom… boom… boom…

Thunderous sounds echoed, as if black flowers bloomed on Luo Tian’s body. When one hundred and eight blossoms opened, he suddenly opened his eyes.

“Hundred Ghost Sealing!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with joy, sensing the demonic energy within his acupoints flowing naturally. His body vanished from the altar.

“Damn it! Another has opened all one hundred and eight acupoints!” People had just begun to rejoice, but Luo Tian’s success sent tremors through them. One successful meant their lives were no longer secure.

“Hum……” After vanishing from the altar, Luo Tian found himself in a grand hall. Upon entering, he instinctively shivered.

“Crack…” A bolt of lightning flashed overhead, catching Luo Tian’s attention. Two powerful figures clashed above.

Cold air filled the hall, and Luo Tian’s feet were already covered in ice. The space was no longer dark but vibrant with color.

“Xue Mian!” Luo Tian’s face changed instantly upon entering the hall.

Chapter 2052: Struggle ()

“Xue Mian, do you really have to fight me? This isn’t the Earth Store King’s true inheritance!” A rough voice echoed. A burly man swung his axe, clashing with Xue Mian’s ice sword. The thunderous sound echoed through the hall, shaking Luo Tian’s spirit.

“Third Army, Commander of Ten Thousand!” Luo Tian instantly recognized the man as Xue Mian’s opponent—another commander of Bountiful Heaven City.

Bountiful Heaven City had sixty-four commanders, eight of whom were at the peak of immortality. The rest were in the late-stage.

This palace journey had seen Xue Mian and the axe-wielding man as two commanders; the others at peak immortality had separate tasks.

Sixty-four commanders, only eight at peak immortality—showing their rarity.

“This belongs to me! I want the inheritance too!” Xue Mian’s cold voice echoed, matching the hall’s chill. Luo Tian felt his teeth chatter.

Upon seeing Luo Tian, both Xue Mian and the man halted instantly, their gazes turning to him.

“Kid, you’ve finally come!” Zhang Ziping was satisfied but raised his sword again, attacking the axe-wielding man.

Seeing Luo Tian, the man showed surprise but soon replaced it with contempt—a threshold immortal was a mere ant to him.

“Kid, you’re from Bountiful Heaven City. Stay put; don’t touch anything here. If you do, I’ll make your life hell!” The man bellowed, his voice threatening.

Luo Tian said nothing, instead gazing at Xue Mian. He pondered whether his methods combined with the axe-wielding man’s could defeat Xue Mian. But he soon abandoned the idea—regardless of whether the man would cooperate, Luo Tian doubted he’d kill Xue Mian. Their truce upon his arrival hinted at this.

“Kill!” The two clashed again, their collision sending waves that shook Luo Tian.

Luo Tian knew he had no role here. He glanced around the hall, then his eyes lit up.

“What are those black flowers? Why do they give me an immortal aura?”

“And that sword—absolutely of the same grade as my Rending Sky Spear!” Luo Tian observed treasures on the hall’s shelves, each item gleaming. Though the axe-wielding man and Xue Mian fought fiercely, their waves didn’t disturb the shelves.

“That’s…” Luo Tian’s eyes shone with light, instantly spotting a transparent bottle on the shelves. Inside floated a gray figure, its eyes vacant—evidently stripped of consciousness.

The gray soul’s aura was ultimate, drawing Luo Tian’s attention. This soul could elevate him to the ultimate realm—unattainable for anyone else.

“Xue Mian, I’ll get these for you; help me secure the inheritance!” The axe-wielding man roared, furious.

He and Xue Mian had entered the hall simultaneously, both discovering its treasures. Initially, he resented Xue Mian—knowing Xue Mian had achieved his current strength through special means.

They belonged to different armies, both commanders—meeting only a few times without combat.

The axe-wielding man had climbed to his current level through hard work, while Xue Mian’s strength was questionable. Normally, the axe-wielding man would dominate.

But upon clashing, he was stunned—Xue Mian’s strength didn’t match his special means. He even seemed to suppress him.

Two peak immortals clashed in the hall, forcing Luo Tian to shiver constantly, dodging their attacks.

“Take it or not?” Luo Tian’s mind wrestled, knowing neither the axe-wielding man nor Xue Mian would let him go.

If he didn’t take it, he might never find another ultimate immortal soul—perhaps not even in his lifetime.

“I’ll just take this one; there are eighteen treasures here!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, then he bit his lip and leapt toward the soul.

“You dare!” The axe-wielding man, though fighting Xue Mian, had been watching the treasures. He roared instantly.

An invisible wave radiated from his voice, a powerful pressure pushing toward Luo Tian like thunder, shaking his spirit.

“Voice Art!” Luo Tian paled—this man had used a technique. Even an early-stage immortal would be shattered by this roar.

“Damn it, it’s not your property!” Luo Tian cursed, not stopping but activating his Yin and Yang Ghost Step, rushing toward the shelf.

“My soul!” Luo Tian reached out, grabbing the transparent bottle. He was now desperate.

“You’re dead!” The axe-wielding man’s face twisted with anger, breaking free of the ice that had bound him. He swung his axe toward Luo Tian.

The axe’s shadow flashed, shaking the hall. Luo Tian’s face paled as he waved his hand, summoning a Yin Fish above him.

“Yin Fish Master, guard me from this strike! I won’t追究 your betrayal!” Luo Tian shouted desperately.

“You moron…” The Yin Fish’s voice echoed, laced with helplessness.

Previously, the Yin Fish had been driven to madness by Luo Tian’s tricks, demanding betrayal—but Jiang Xiong hadn’t accepted it. The Yin Fish had been embarrassed and avoided appearing, fearing angering Luo Tian.

This time, summoning the Yin Fish, it had prepared to sacrifice everything to help Luo Tian, hoping to change his view.

“You moron, Luo Tian! Can’t you change?” The Yin Fish scolded immediately upon appearing.

“I can only block once; I can’t do more!” The Yin Fish gritted its teeth but chose to block the attack.

“Hum…” The axe’s shadow flashed overhead, striking the Yin Fish’s body. A thunderous crack echoed through the hall. Luo Tian stood beneath it, his blood spattering from his mouth.

His hand reached for the shelf but was blocked by a barrier upon touching the soul.

“Boom…” Luo Tian stumbled back, his expression dark. At that moment of contact, a powerful repulsion force pushed him away.

“Need the Hundred Ghost Sealing to obtain this ultimate immortal soul!” Luo Tian realized instantly, his face darkening.

“Can’t block anymore!” The Yin Fish’s weakened voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind—this strike had already cracked its body. Now, it lay in a corner like a stone.

“No chance left!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. If he touched the soul again, his luck wouldn’t be so good.

“Hum…” The axe-wielding man seemed determined to let Luo Tian die, seeing him as an ant.

The axe’s shadow flashed again, swinging toward Luo Tian with greater force. But just as it flew out, it turned to ice, freezing the illusion and shattering.

“Your opponent is me!” Xue Mian’s cold voice echoed, his ice sword striking the axe-wielding man repeatedly.

“An ant—do you want to keep it alive?” The axe-wielding man roared, swinging his axe again.

“You let him live, I’ll kill him!” Xue Mian coldly replied, his attacks intensifying. He forced the axe-wielding man to ignore Luo Tian entirely.

“Another stalemate!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, stepping toward several immortal souls. His hands moved rapidly, forming black seals that etched onto the barrier.

“Xue Mian, you’ve gone too far! I originally hoped we could avoid a fight, but you’ve insulted me too much. I had no choice but to kill you!” The axe-wielding man roared, his axe’s aura expanding.

His peak immortal strength fully unleashed, no longer holding back—this was his all-out effort.

The ultimate immortal soul was precious; obtaining it could exchange for treasures. The axe-wielding man wouldn’t let a small Luo Tian touch it.

“Ten… one hundred…” Luo Tian completed the one hundred and eight seals in moments.

“Hum…” Just as he needed a few more seals to break the barrier, a figure appeared in the hall.

Dressed in black, with black eyes and carrying a long spear that seemed to roar with souls, the youth radiated an icy aura.

Upon his appearance, Xue Mian’s eyes widened in shock, his body frozen mid-fight.

“Impossible!” Luo Tian also gaped, staring at the figure as if seeing a ghost.

Wangyue Sect’s Master Wanghu, Yang Huanyu!

Instantly, both men recalled past memories—this figure had once caused chaos across Tianyuan Continent, seeking to sacrifice it for immortality.

Though Yang Huanyu’s appearance had changed slightly, Luo Tian would never mistake him. They’d been rivals before; if not for Luo Tian’s emergence, Yang Huanyu might have already sacrificed the continent.

Xue Mian and Luo Tian were speechless, but the axe-wielding man didn’t know. He swung his axe toward Xue Mian.

As he did, his face changed—surprised that Xue Mian didn’t block. His eyes gleamed with joy.

“All mine!” The axe-wielding man’s mind rejoiced, believing this strike would kill Xue Mian or at least injure him. Then he could easily eliminate Luo Tian and the hellish cultivator, claiming all treasures for himself.

With these treasures, he might even attempt to break through the threshold of an immortal king.

The green axe’s shadow struck Xue Mian, splattering blood from his body and sending him flying into the hall’s wall. Blood trickled down Xue Mian’s lips.

“You two also die!” The axe-wielding man laughed, swinging his axe toward Yang Huanyu.

In his mind, Yang Huanyu was a hellish cultivator—first kill the hellish ones.

“Luo Tian, long time no see!” Yang Huanyu seemed pleased with Luo Tian’s expression, smiling slightly. Yet his eyes remained serious as he faced the axe-wielding man’s strike.

This attack could kill any mid-stage immortal or even a late-stage one. Facing it, Yang Huanyu raised his spear—幽冥战戟 (Yin and Yang War Halberd)!

A thousand ghosts roared, their cries echoing through the hall. Black demonic energy swirled around the spear, howling into it.

“Hum…” Yang Huanyu swung his Yin and Yang War Halberd, releasing a terrifying aura. Waves of energy surged toward the green axe’s shadow.

“Crack…” The hall trembled, thunderous sounds shaking all directions. Luo Tian’s face paled further.

“Boom…” Yang Huanyu’s body collided with the hall’s wall, causing it to cave in. His body was riddled with cracks, blood spewing from his mouth.

“Not dead!” The axe-wielding man was surprised—this strike had used only half his strength.

“Are all threshold immortals this weak?” He doubted himself, recalling how Luo Tian had survived his strike before. Then this hellish cultivator’s kid hadn’t died either.

“Frostbite!” A cold voice echoed, and the hall was instantly enveloped in frigid air. Ice weapons filled the space, coating everything—including Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu—in frost.

“Break Frost!” Xue Mian appeared beside the axe-wielding man, his ice sword descending toward his skull.

A crack echoed—before the sword could pierce him, the ice sculpture shattered. The axe-wielding man let out a shiver, his eyes trembling.

Though he’d dodged Xue Mian’s fatal strike, his body was still encased in ice, trembling.

“Even immortal power is frozen!” The axe-wielding man spoke in disbelief. Yet seeing Xue Mian’s blood and deep wound, his confidence returned.

“Open Heaven!” The axe-wielding man roared, his body radiating a formation. Thunderous sounds erupted as his voice art echoed again. The frozen world began to crack around him.

“Winter’s Wrath!” Xue Mian whispered, his ice sword moving again. Snowy dragons erupted from it, roaring with cold power.

One… two…

In moments, eight icy dragons enveloped the hall, their cold breaths healing the cracked ice.

“I won’t let you win!” The axe-wielding man roared, his green half-moon axe swinging wildly. Two figures stood in a stalemate, their ground cracks and healings echoing endlessly.

“Cold…” Luo Tian remained an ice sculpture but retained consciousness. His feeling was only coldness—this chill could freeze everything, his body, cultivation, and soul.

“If this continues, I’ll definitely be frozen to death!” Luo Tian’s mind panicked. He knew Xue Mian and the axe-wielding man were fighting fiercely; he might be caught in the crossfire. Even a single wave touching him would shatter him.

The “万物化生诀” (Everything Becomes Life) was the best method now, as winter would give way to spring.

“Open!” At the same time, Luo Tian’s blood boiled, resisting the extreme cold.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed from his body as he resisted, cracks forming on the ice.

Meanwhile, Yang Huanyu’s sculpture also cracked, black energy seeping out through the fissures.

“Crack…” At the same time, Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu broke free of their ice prisons, locking eyes.

“Yang Huanyu!” Luo Tian spoke calmly, no longer shocked but with a serious gaze.

“You have much to say?”

“But now isn’t the time for nostalgia!” Yang Huanyu shook his head, swinging his Yin and Yang War Halberd.

“We are destined to be in different worlds!”

“You want the ultimate immortal soul, I do too!” Yang Huanyu smiled slightly, his eyes filled with battle intent.

“I never expected to meet you here!” Yang Huanyu leapt into the air, gliding across the ice toward Luo Tian.

“I don’t want to be your enemy!” Luo Tian sighed, his Rending Sky Spear materializing in his hand.

His other hand held a black spear—another Yin and Yang War Halberd, which he flung toward Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu caught the spear with a smile: “Though not my original one, thank you!”

This thanks was understood by both—Yang Huanyu knew it, and Luo Tian did too. It was the request Yang Huanyu had made before his death.

“If I enter the Immortal Realm, plant my spear in its earth!” Luo Tian seemed to hear Yang Huanyu’s desperate voice.

“This ultimate immortal soul, I won’t let it go!” Yang Huanyu shouted again, interrupting Luo Tian’s thoughts. Black light flickered in his hand.

“I won’t let it go either!” Luo Tian replied, raising his Rending Sky Spear to meet the Yin and Yang War Halberd.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed through the hall as the black spear struck the golden spear.

This strike shook Luo Tian’s spirit, and his Rending Sky Spear erupted with fierce battle intent. His eyes reflected memories of their past battles on the Tianyuan Continent—exactly this scene.

But now, both had surpassed their former selves; the Tianyuan Continent was but a thought to them.

“Nostalgia…” Yang Huanyu turned, his eyes filled with longing, a slight smile on his lips.

“I thought we’d never meet again!”

“I thought you’d only leave the Tianyuan Continent and die there in those so-called Nine Domains!” Yang Huanyu leapt again, his Yin and Yang War Halberd raised high.

A black vortex formed on the spear, with demonic energy howling into ghostly forms that etched patterns onto it.

“Hundred Ghosts’ Power!” Yang Huanyu roared, breaking through space with his spear.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with admiration for Yang Huanyu’s strength, but he didn’t retaliate. He held his Rending Sky Spear.

Thunder clashed; the ice beneath Luo Tian cracked violently, and his legs trembled as cracks formed.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian spat blood, gazing at Yang Huanyu.

“You’re persistent. I’ve had many enemies, but you are the one who makes me admire!”

“Even in hell, I have many enemies, but none match your pressure from before!” Yang Huanyu shook his hand, his gaze never leaving Luo Tian.

“It’s an honor!” Luo Tian smiled lightly, his eyes filled with battle intent—his aura had not wavered but grown even more intense.
