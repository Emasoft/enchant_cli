As soon as Ye Chen stepped into Tian Gui Wang City, he heard a series of thunderous roars. Above the city's skyline stood a towering figure, a black tiger emitting fierce growls and spewing dark flames that swept across the city's periphery.

"Duanyijue, I'm back again!" a domineering voice echoed over Tian Gui Wang City, causing buildings to collapse in waves.

"Beast Ghost King, it's been over a month—when will this end?" a furious roar erupted from the city lord's mansion, as a streak of violet light shot forth to clash with the towering figure.

The citizens of Tian Gui Wang City cried out in despair, their voices mingling with the chaos. Two mid-stage Immortal Kings clashing meant devastation for the city's residents.

"It's said that when the Eight Heavenly Kings participated in the Ten Palaces Grand Competition, Tian Gui Wang ordered his men to poison the entire Beast Ghost City, exterminating the Luo family—the foremost of the three major families," murmured one citizen.

"The Luo family? They were the top among the three major families, possessing an ancestor who had reached the threshold of Immortal King. To have them wiped out so thoroughly, the Beast Ghost King must be heartbroken," another citizen whispered.

Ye Chen walked along the ruined streets, absorbing the people's murmurs and observing the ongoing battle between the Beast Ghost King and Tian Gui Wang above. His heart trembled in awe.

"The Luo family... it's been destroyed!" Luo Tian stood upon crimson earth, his face darkened. He hadn't expected the Luo family to be annihilated.

"I killed Duan Boyang!" Luo Tian suddenly realized the cause, understanding that everything stemmed from his own hand. If he hadn't slain Duan Peizhen and Duan Boyang, the Luo family would never have been wiped out.

"Damn it! Why didn't I think of this earlier!" Luo Tian's face darkened, his body trembling as he recalled Luo Shui’s image.

"Buzz..." The Dragon Abyss Sword radiated a sinister aura, gradually sinking into Luo Tian’s body, intensifying his bloodlust.

"Kid, wake up! Don’t be reckless— you’re no match for him. I’m not either!" The voice of the Supplementing Heaven Stone echoed within Luo Tian’s mind, restoring his clarity. The Dragon Abyss Sword returned to its normal state.

Luo Tian retrieved a gourd, drinking two sips of Yellow Spring Water to purge the sinister aura from his body. His eyes narrowed in contemplation.

"Direct confrontation is out of the question. I must strike from the shadows!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, his eyes gleaming with murderous intent. This was a rare display of ruthless determination for him.

The city's populace murmured as they watched the battle above, their voices laced with fear. The Luo family had been a major clan; even the direct descendants numbered over ten thousand. To have them utterly eradicated was no exaggeration.

"Revenge is inevitable. I’m not yet strong enough to challenge Tian Gui Wang, so I’ll strike at his descendants!"

"His name is Duan Zhijue, right? Today I’ll add a word to it—'disinherited.' Let’s see if anyone in Tian Gui Wang City can escape my shadowy assassination!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination.

"Ye Chen, you should leave first and wait for me in the Beast Ghost King City. I have some matters to attend here," Luo Tian transmitted mentally to Ye Chen, causing the latter’s body to tremble.

"Don’t be reckless! You’re no match for him. A gentleman’s revenge takes ten years!" Ye Chen immediately understood Luo Tian’s plan and urgently advised him. To him, this was tantamount to suicide.

"I know what I’m doing," Luo Tian replied mentally before sending the Supplementing Heaven Stone to a corner. He changed his appearance and didn’t rush out immediately, as he had no intention of revealing himself. Instead, he planned to thoroughly investigate Tian Gui Wang’s movements before striking, aiming to reduce the latter to a hollow title.

When Ye Chen noticed Luo Tian’s silence, he took advantage of the chaos to exit Tian Gui Wang City and head toward the Beast Ghost King City. Ye Chen was no fool; he knew Luo Tian wasn’t naive—had he been, he wouldn’t have survived this long.

"Brave indeed!" Ye Chen marveled again at Luo Tian’s audacity, daring to stay and confront Tian Gui Wang.

"I’ll be back tomorrow!" The Beast Ghost King also caused a ruckus, killing several of Tian Gui Wang’s subordinates before departing, leaving behind a ruined city and a brooding Tian Gui Wang.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian transformed into dust, drifting through Tian Gui Wang City without making a move, like a venomous snake lurking in the shadows.

Time passed slowly; half a month had elapsed, and the Beast Ghost King never returned.

"Have the guts to come every day!" Tian Gui Wang laughed, knowing the Beast Ghost King wouldn’t appear daily. As long as he endured, the Beast Ghost King would eventually be driven away.

The city gradually regained its calm as its people began to rebuild Tian Gui Wang City.

"How many sons and daughters does he have? One hundred and sixty-two sons, over thirty daughters?"

"Old bastard really knows how to reproduce!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. Over these days, he had thoroughly investigated Tian Gui Wang’s situation and was now ready to strike.

"I’ll start with the weakest," Luo Tian muttered, transforming into dust and drifting toward the main gate of Tian Gui Wang City’s lord’s mansion, waiting for his prey.

After an hour, a figure finally emerged from the gate—slender in build, with a lecherous expression and three or four henchmen trailing behind.

The youth was of average height, his face gaunt but his expression arrogant. His cultivation was merely at the threshold of Immortal King, while his henchmen were two mid-stage Immortal Kings.

"You’ll do," Luo Tian sneered internally, commanding the Supplementing Heaven Stone to silently follow the youth.

"Damn it, I’ve been cooped up for over a month—this Beast Ghost King is really terrifying!" The youth cursed as he strolled through Tian Gui Wang City’s streets, unaware that Luo Tian had already marked him.

"Let’s go! This year I’ll take you all for a good time!" The youth cheerfully addressed his four henchmen.

"Master, the Drunken Soul Pavilion has reopened. I heard they’ve acquired some fine girls. Shall we check it out?" One of his sycophants flattered him.

"Ha! Let’s go quickly!" The youth’s face lit up with lust, licking his lips eagerly as he headed toward the location.

Duan Cheng, one of Tian Gui Wang’s sons, was a decadent and indulgent figure. Among Tian Gui Wang’s many sons, he wasn’t particularly outstanding or ambitious—spending his days indulging in pleasures and idleness. He was known as one of Tian Gui Wang’s three major scourges.

Yet, due to his status as the son of a great lord, no one dared to provoke him. He was left to run rampant unchecked.

As Duan Cheng strolled through the streets, the entire area fell silent. Not a single woman remained within ten miles—this was how the city’s people described Duan Cheng.

Chapter 2198: Infinite Assassination

Duan Cheng and his group strode confidently toward the Drunken Soul Pavilion. As they took a few steps, Duan Cheng felt an inexplicable chill down his spine, his body instinctively shivering.

"Damn it, I haven’t stepped out for over a month—why do I feel so uncomfortable?" Duan Cheng cursed, glancing at the fearful gazes of those around him. A sense of superiority swelled within him.

"Buzz..." Just as Duan Cheng had taken a few steps, a black sword beam shot forth from the void. The immense blade surged forward instantly, slicing through Duan Cheng and his four henchmen.

Plop! Plop! Plop! The four men stared in disbelief before being severed at the waist, their bodies collapsing to the ground.

Nine-colored flames erupted, consuming the four corpses and even their souls, leaving nothing but ashes in the nine-colored fire.

From the moment the sword beam appeared until it killed Duan Cheng and his men, it was all in an instant. Many hadn’t even blinked before witnessing the swirling ashes dispersing into view. Only the scorching air confirmed their presence and death.

"Boom!" The crowd erupted in chaos, staring at the ashes vanishing into the air. None could fathom that Duan Cheng had been killed so swiftly.

"Duan Cheng is dead! My god… who dared to assassinate the son of Tian Gui Wang in his own city!" The people murmured, trembling as they watched Duan Cheng’s ashes scatter into the sky. They had seen no one but a single sword beam.

"This is the first!" Luo Tian smiled, commanding the Supplementing Heaven Stone to return to the main gate of Tian Gui Wang City’s lord’s mansion.

"Ha! Kid, should we raid the city lord’s treasure vault?" The Supplementing Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him slightly tempted.

Luo Tian’s decision to stay behind was largely due to the Supplementing Heaven Stone—its concealment made even mid-stage Immortal Kings unable to detect it. This placed Luo Tian in an unbeatable position; even Tian Gui Wang couldn’t find him unless a power like the Black and White Officials intervened.

The news of Duan Cheng’s death quickly reached Tian Gui Wang, but it only caused him to frown slightly.

"Nothing major—probably the Beast Ghost King’s men. Tell your sons to stay in the lord’s mansion; those hidden rats won’t dare strike within it."

"Who else but my sons! Alas, Boyang was my favorite son. He was killed by that little brat! Even destroying the Luo family couldn’t ease my resentment!" Tian Gui Wang’s face darkened.

As Tian Gui Wang’s orders echoed, his sons became agitated. Yet many ignored his command and stepped out of the lord’s mansion.

Luo Tian, like a hunter, continued to slay those who dared leave the lord’s mansion.

Kill! Kill! Kill!

Each of Tian Gui Wang’s offspring met their end beneath the Dragon Abyss Sword, struck down in a single blow and reduced to ashes. One… two…

After killing over thirty of Tian Gui Wang’s offspring, the latter finally realized their assassin was no ordinary foe.

These deaths also reached Tian Gui Wang’s ears, inciting his fury.

"A bunch of useless brats! Daring to defy my orders!" Tian Gui Wang finally erupted in anger. Thirty sons, many of whom had promising potential—each death was a blow to him.

Yet for the next two days, no more deaths were reported, offering Tian Gui Wang some relief.

"Not enough—aren’t you afraid to come out?" Luo Tian stood on the crimson earth, gazing at the lord’s mansion without rushing in.

After waiting three days, Luo Tian finally grew impatient and sent the Supplementing Heaven Stone into the mansion. However, just as he prepared to infiltrate, a figure emerged from the lord’s mansion.

Clad in black robes with five-venom patterns on his sleeves, the youth’s face bore a cold expression. His cultivation was at mid-stage Immortal King.

"Duan Hun?" Luo Tian recognized the youth as one of Tian Gui Wang’s sons.

Duan Hun, a favored son of Tian Gui Wang, was not as beloved as Duan Boyang but had been destined for the Wheel Turning Sect.

"It shouldn’t be," Luo Tian frowned, puzzled that he hadn’t seen anyone emerge after waiting two or three days. Yet the first to appear was a fat sheep—killing Duan Hun would surely grieve Duan Zhijue.

However, Luo Tian didn’t strike immediately but waited for Duan Hun to walk away, as an ominous feeling lingered in his heart.

"Kid, there’s a threshold Immortal King hiding—this is clearly an attempt to lure you out," the Supplementing Heaven Stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

"A threshold Immortal King!" Luo Tian’s heart tightened, realizing something was amiss.

After pondering, Luo Tian decided to follow Duan Hun, hoping for an opportunity. His chance was one shot—kill in one strike and have the Supplementing Heaven Stone shrink him back here. Otherwise, a threshold Immortal King’s strike was no easy feat to withstand. Though Luo Tian had thick skin, he couldn’t endure it.

Duan Hun strolled through the streets with no expression, but his heart was tense. These days, many of his siblings had died—none had even caught a glimpse of their killer, all struck down in one blow.

Duan Hun didn’t know the opponent’s strength. If it was a threshold Immortal King, his life might not be safe.

"Is that Duan Hun? He dares to come out—doesn’t he fear being killed?" The people of Tian Gui Wang City displayed surprise.

These days, many of Tian Gui Wang’s sons had died one after another. Naturally, the city’s people were aware—thirty plus offspring dead in a few days. Duan Hun daring to step out was admirable.

"Still, the dead were only mid-stage Immortal Kings. Duan Hun is at mid-stage Immortal King—probably no problem," the people mused, eyes filled with anticipation. Some even followed Duan Hun to see if he’d be killed.

Seeing the crowd behind him, Duan Hun’s face brightened. Especially hearing the people’s flattery, he smiled slightly.

"Master Duan Hun, don’t worry—we’ll protect you. No one can harm you!" The people shouted loudly.

The news of Duan Boyang’s death had reached Tian Gui Wang City, and Duan Hun was the most likely candidate to succeed Duan Boyang. Naturally, many wanted to curry favor.

Before long, over a hundred people followed Duan Hun as he strolled through the wide streets. He was surrounded by the crowd, wandering leisurely.

"Come out already! You coward!" After walking for half an hour, Duan Hun hadn’t seen his killer. He grew impatient and taunted the assassin.

"I’m right here! If you have the guts, come out and I’ll crush you!" Duan Hun cursed repeatedly.

"Wait for me to show you my strength," Luo Tian followed silently, sneering without much regard for Duan Hun’s taunts.

"Master, I think the killer is intimidated by your might and won’t strike. I have a plan—let’s go out of the city. Once outside, he might take the risk to strike," one sly youth suggested to Duan Hun.

"Ah, a good plan. I’ll go out today—see if you dare to strike!" Duan Hun hesitated but, seeing the crowd and two mid-stage Immortal Kings nearby, and considering the threshold Immortal King hidden within, he nodded.

Duan Hun guessed that the killer wouldn’t dare to strike now or had already left, as he’d been taunting for so long. If the killer had the strength to kill him, they would’ve done it already—just like their siblings were killed within the city.

"Really foolish!" Luo Tian heard Duan Hun’s words, originally planning to strike when Duan Hun grew tired and returned to the lord’s mansion. That would be the most opportune moment with the highest success rate. But he hadn’t expected Duan Hun to voluntarily leave the city.

Who was Luo Tian’s greatest fear? Obviously Duan Zhijue. In Tian Gui Wang City, if he struck, it would inevitably draw Duan Zhijue’s attention. If the latter arrived, Luo Tian wouldn’t have ten lives to survive.

Soon, a group escorted Duan Hun through the city gates and onto the main road. Luo Tian naturally followed.

"Wait a bit longer—wait for them to relax when returning," Luo Tian remained calm, waiting for Duan Hun’s return.

Curses echoed continuously as the hundred people followed Duan Hun, shouting for an hour. Luo Tian still hadn’t appeared.

"Let’s go—seems that coward is too scared to strike!" Duan Hun finally smiled, addressing the crowd.

"Opportunity!" As people relaxed and prepared to return to Tian Gui Wang City, Luo Tian’s killing intent emerged.

"Killing intent!" A senior elder stood in the void, guarding Duan Hun. Just as Luo Tian drew his Dragon Abyss Sword to strike, he paused—because a figure had moved faster than him. A white dragon surged forth from the sky, slicing toward Duan Hun.

Chapter 2199: Father and Son United

The white dragon surged toward Duan Hun, its sword qi piercing the heavens. The overwhelming aura made the sky change color, and Duan Hun’s face paled as he felt the pressure from a mid-stage Immortal King.

Crushing, one strike—Duan Hun was crushed by the might of a mid-stage Immortal King. A mid-stage Immortal King could not withstand an attack from a threshold Immortal King.

Everyone was stunned, their eyes wide with disbelief as they stared at the white sword beam slicing toward Duan Hun.

"Finally, it wasn’t a wasted trip!" As the sword beam was about to pierce Duan Hun’s body, a black hand shot from the void and grabbed the white dragon.

"Roar!" The white sword beam was instantly crushed by the black hand. A shadow appeared in people’s vision, obscured by dark mist. As the black hand emerged, the shadow turned and attempted to flee.

"Come all this way—don’t run!" As the shadow tried to escape, an elder’s figure stepped from the void. His eyes were cold as he blocked the shadow’s path and struck with a palm.

"Duan Gao!" Seeing the elder, the figure obscured by dark mist spoke with a hoarse voice, filled with endless hatred.

"His voice?" Luo Tian frowned, recognizing it as familiar—especially the figure’s aura made Duan Gao recognize him.

"Dislike me? You must be a descendant of the Luo family!" The elder smiled, his voice filled with contempt. He had personally eradicated the Luo family and knew exactly who this person was.

"Rippling water sounds," a flow of water echoed as the sword transformed into a long chain, sweeping toward Duan Gao.

"Autumn Water Sky!"

"This is the Autumn Water Sword!" Luo Tian recognized the white sword, his eyes wide with disbelief.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was stunned, Duan Gao fought the figure attempting to kill Duan Hun.

One mid-stage Immortal King, one threshold Immortal King—results were obvious. Even if the latter’s sword had no flaws, their strength was vastly different. Each strike from Duan Gao made the latter spit blood.

"He’s still alive!" Luo Tian observed a few moves and recognized the obscured figure as Luo Shui, his eyes filled with joy.

"Pu!" As Luo Tian was delighted, Luo Shui’s body was struck by Duan Gao and fell to the ground.

"Duan Gao, capture him alive! I want to bring him back!" Duan Hun’s eyes glowed with excitement, watching Luo Shui spit blood after being struck by Duan Gao.

Luo Shui saw the descending Duan Gao and knew he was no match for him. However, Luo Shui still had a final sacrifice—using it could allow him to kill Duan Hun and wound Duan Gao.

"Regretful, I won’t see my son reach the peak," Luo Shui smiled softly, knowing Luo Tian would avenge him.

"Don’t use it—don’t resist!" As Luo Shui prepared to sacrifice, Luo Tian urgently transmitted mentally, causing Luo Shui’s body to tremble slightly.

At the same time, Luo Tian finally struck, his fluctuations enveloping Luo Shui and making him vanish from people’s sight.

Sword beams flashed, and Luo Tian appeared like a ghost before Duan Hun, his black sword slicing toward him.

"Buzz..." Even Duan Gao hadn’t expected Luo Tian to appear suddenly, his eyes filled with disbelief.

As people were stunned, the black sword struck Duan Hun’s body, accompanied by nine-colored flames. The flames instantly took Duan Hun’s life without leaving a trace.

"Die!" Duan Gao’s fury was immense—Duan Hun had been killed under his nose, a humiliation. Moreover, the opponent was merely a mid-stage Immortal King.

"Boom!" A powerful pressure radiated from Duan Gao, the sky darkened, and he struck Luo Tian with a palm.

The black hand expanded instantly, like a mountain, carrying overwhelming power and crushing down on Luo Tian. The void shattered where the hand passed, and two unfortunate souls were crushed by it.

"Duan Hun has been killed!" Everyone’s faces showed disbelief—killers weren’t just one, but another.

"Wrong! The second is the real master because he used nine-colored flames!"

"This person’s patience is incredible—waiting this long to strike!" People began discussing, trying to glimpse Luo Tian’s true face but failing—his features seemed distorted.

"Block it! If I block this strike, I can return!" Luo Tian muttered internally, placing the Dragon Abyss Sword in front of him. He could already sense the Supplementing Heaven Stone’s fluctuations activating on his body.

The black hand, crushing through nine heavens, pressed down onto the Dragon Abyss Sword. Luo Tian spat blood immediately, his body emitting a series of cracks.

Luo Tian’s face turned pale, the ground beneath him collapsing continuously, his body riddled with cracks.

"Buzz..." Finally, after being crushed thirty feet, the Supplementing Heaven Stone’s function activated. Luo Tian fell helplessly onto the crimson earth.

"Boom!"

The area around where Luo Tian had stood now bore a massive handprint, leaving people in awe.

"This is the strength of a threshold Immortal King—on the verge of Immortal King and mid-stage Immortal King!" People’s faces showed reverence as they gazed at Duan Gao above.

"Was that person crushed by a single palm?" People then saw the figure beneath the handprint, exclaiming in disbelief.

However, Duan Gao’s face was dark—his keen senses told him that Luo Tian had vanished, not dead.

"Where?" Duan Gao’s face darkened as he scanned the surroundings, his formidable spiritual sense sweeping across all directions to find Luo Tian but found no trace—Luo Tian had seemingly vanished.

"Damn it!" Duan Gao hadn’t expected the opponent to escape under his nose.

On the crimson earth, Luo Tian spat blood violently, gasping for breath. He marveled at the threshold Immortal King’s might but was also delighted by the Supplementing Heaven Stone’s miracle.

Luo Shui, pale-faced, watched Luo Tian appear and recognized him.

"Dust, how did you end up here?" Luo Shui asked, surprised.

"Passing through—intended to return and check on you, but I heard the news of the Luo family’s extermination!" Luo Tian handed Luo Shui a pill and took one himself.

"Alas, you did hear it. Did you kill all of Tian Gui Wang’s sons?" Luo Shui sighed, his eyes filled with sorrow.

"Yes, I did. How are you here?" Luo Tian’s face was excited; he had thought Luo Shui was dead but hadn’t expected him to survive.

"I’ve been outside the city for half a month, never entering it. I knew if I did, Tian Gui Wang would sense me!"

"As for why I’m not dead..."

"Probably to make me despair. After all, Tian Gui Wang is a formidable force—perhaps I’ll never be able to avenge!" Luo Shui spoke softly, his voice filled with pain. His life had been entangled with Tian Gui Wang for a long time.

"A gentleman’s revenge takes ten years. Let’s collect some interest now. We’ll settle accounts with Tian Gui Wang eventually!" Luo Tian looked at Luo Shui, his hair already streaked with white. He could imagine the pain Luo Shui had endured these days.

"I originally planned to wait for an opportunity, but before I could act, you started killing Tian Gui Wang’s sons. This gave me great inspiration, so I waited outside the city for you to emerge. I didn’t expect a trap instead—but I’m glad I met you; otherwise, I would’ve died here today!" Luo Shui spoke softly, recounting his purpose to Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." As the two conversed, a pressure swept through the world—Duan Gao’s spiritual sense continuously scanned. Luo Shui and Luo Tian naturally felt the pressure.

"Where is this place?" Luo Shui’s eyes showed surprise, gazing at Duan Gao’s furious expression. He could clearly see Duan Gao’s anger but found himself undetected, which puzzled him.

"Rest assured—no one can find us, not even Tian Gui Wang himself. This is our advantage in assassinating his offspring. We’ll unite as father and son to make Tian Gui Wang childless, reducing him to a hollow title. Let me vent my anger for you!" Luo Tian shouted loudly.

"Brat, first recover—those two nearly got us killed!" Seeing Luo Tian, Luo Shui’s mood improved. He chuckled and began to meditate to recover his strength.

Luo Tian also started recovering his cultivation, leaving Duan Gao to search endlessly. After half an hour, Duan Gao finally gave up, his face dark and angry. He killed the youth who had advised Duan Hun to leave in frustration, then turned back toward Tian Gui Wang City.

"Even Duan Gao couldn’t catch the assassin. Besides Tian Gui Wang himself, who else could capture him?" As Duan Gao left, people trembled at the sight of the youth’s bloody corpse and returned to Tian Gui Wang City.

A single particle of dust drifted behind the crowd, eventually reaching Tian Gui Wang’s residence—the lord’s mansion.

"What? The person suddenly vanished? And it was two people?" Tian Gui Wang’s face darkened as he listened to Duan Gao’s report, his lips twitching.

Chapter 2200: Unrestrained

"I underestimated this assassin—how could he escape under your nose, and it was two people? One of them is Luo Shui from the Luo family?"

"I had him stay to let him experience the pain of losing a son. I never expected this nuisance would cause such chaos," Tian Gui Wang said, his voice laced with impatience.

Duan Hun’s exit from the lord’s mansion was Tian Gui Wang’s plan to lure out the assassin, but it had backfired.

"However, they were both wounded. They won’t be able to fight for a few days. Their strength isn’t strong—one at threshold Immortal King, one at mid-stage Immortal King. Their escape method was quite mysterious," Duan Gao said confidently.

"Report!" Just as Duan Gao finished speaking, a frantic voice echoed from outside the hall.

"Speak!" Tian Gui Wang’s face darkened, his voice deep.

"Eighteen Master was assassinated—just like the others, struck down in one blow..." The guard’s trembling voice echoed through the room.

"What!" Duan Gao’s face showed disbelief—just after he boasted, the opponent had killed one of Tian Gui Wang’s sons.

"Didn’t I tell them not to leave the lord’s mansion? Why did they disobey?" Tian Gui Wang’s face darkened, his eyes filled with anger.

"Report, Lord—Master was killed within the lord’s mansion..." The guard’s voice echoed through the hall, further angering Tian Gui Wang.

"Really foolish—daring to kill within my lord’s mansion!" Tian Gui Wang roared, his domain instantly enveloping the entire lord’s mansion.

Duan Gao’s face was also grim—before he faced the assassin, the killer had already killed outside. After confronting the assassin, they even entered the lord’s mansion to kill.

"What happened?" Tian Gui Wang’s face showed shock, as his domain encompassed the entire city. Yet he found no trace of an intruder—this was alarming.

"If this person has the strength of a mid-stage Immortal King, could he even kill me?" Tian Gui Wang’s brows furrowed. He knew trouble was coming.

"I’ll see if you dare to strike again. As long as you do, I’ll sense it!" Tian Gui Wang sneered but didn’t withdraw his domain. He continued monitoring the lord’s mansion.

"Didn’t you remove your domain? What use is it?" Luo Tian smiled coldly, standing on the crimson earth. No matter how hard Tian Gui Wang thought, he couldn’t fathom that the assassin of his many sons was a single particle of dust.

"Next!" Luo Tian and Luo Shui had the Supplementing Heaven Stone locate their next target.

In a luxurious room, a man and woman were naked, engaging in adult activities. After their passion, they lay panting on the bed.

"Alas, Tian Gui City has been unstable recently. Father confined us—can’t even go out," the youth sighed.

"Is this why you’re here with me?" The woman lay on his chest, her eyes soft.

"Can’t help it—this is the lord’s mansion; too many people. We might draw attention, and if Father hears about it, that would be trouble," the youth caressed her, his eyes filled with obsession.

The youth was Duan Peng, a mid-stage Immortal King and one of Tian Gui Wang’s sons. Though not as prominent as Duan Boyang or Duan Hun, he was known to Tian Gui Wang.

"Disgusting!" Luo Tian stood there, gazing at the two. He had received intelligence about Duan Peng and knew this woman was also in his records—she was one of Tian Gui Wang’s daughters. They had formed a forbidden love.

What made Luo Tian speechless was that he wanted to rush out, but the Supplementing Heaven Stone wouldn’t let him. Instead, it commented with amusement.

"There’s nothing wrong with it," the Supplementing Heaven Stone said. "We’ll be careful within the lord’s mansion. I heard thirty plus siblings have died. Since it’s safe here, the assassin might dare to enter—after all, Father is personally in charge!" The youth’s hand moved again.

"Supplementing Heaven Stone, you bastard—don’t make me use the restriction!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth.

"Okay, okay! It’s not interesting anymore," the Supplementing Heaven Stone quickly emitted fluctuations.

"Buzz..." Luo Shui and Luo Tian appeared instantly in the room. Luo Shui wielded his sword, killing the two, while Luo Tian grabbed their souls and crushed them.

Their movements were seamless, perfectly coordinated—taking the two lives without even realizing it.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian and Luo Shui finished killing Duan Peng, a terrifying pressure swept through the room.

Almost instantly after killing Duan Peng, Tian Gui Wang sensed it and knew the assassin had struck again. He immediately used heavenly power to seal the room.

A moment later, Tian Gui Wang appeared in the room but found no trace of Luo Tian and Luo Shui. His face darkened, almost dripping with anger.

"Damn it!" Tian Gui Wang quickly saw the two naked bodies on the bed, realizing why they were like that. He grabbed their bodies and annihilated them instantly.

Tian Gui Wang was furious—he had sealed the void, yet the assassin still escaped and even witnessed his son and daughter in debauchery.

Luo Tian and Luo Shui were not far from Tian Gui Wang, trapped by heavenly power. The Supplementing Heaven Stone dared not move.

Seeing Tian Gui Wang’s rage, Luo Tian and Luo Shui smiled. Luo Tian had intentionally left the two corpses instead of burning them—this time, he wanted to let Tian Gui Wang see his son and daughter in their final state.

"Idiot! Don’t let me catch you—when I do, I’ll skin and dismember you!" Tian Gui Wang roared. He had a feeling the assassin was still in the lord’s mansion but didn’t know he was just a few feet away.

After cursing, Tian Gui Wang disappeared from the room and returned to his residence.

As Tian Gui Wang left, although his domain remained, the heavenly power’s restriction had vanished. The Supplementing Heaven Stone floated out of the room to find their next target.
