While flying, Luo Tian unleashed his Yin Fish, Heaven's Will Thunder Sword, and the Rip Sky Spear, which hovered above their heads. Two and a half Epoch Treasures radiated three-colored light, enveloping Luo Tian and Man Hun completely. Instantly, they plunged into the immortal energy surrounding Star River Mansion. A low hum resonated as apocalyptic energies sliced through the tri-colored barrier before them, emitting a grating sound. "Hold on!" Man Hun watched the tri-colored barrier being eroded by the immortal energy, his spirit trembling as he prayed desperately. The Heaven's Will Thunder Sword, Rip Sky Spear, and Yin Fish were formidable treasures of the Nine Domains' peak, unyielding even against the vast immortal energy. Amidst the grating hum, they protected Luo Tian and Man Hun as they reached the golden gate. Though the three treasures had guided them to the gate, they bore numerous imprints, evidently wounded by the immortal energy. "Open!" Luo Tian roared, his golden fist striking the golden gate with full force. Man Hun also exerted all his strength to smash into the gate, and a thunderous echo echoed through space. Yet moments later, Luo Tian and Man Hun were stunned—despite their combined might, the colossal Star River Mansion gate only cracked slightly. "Again!" Luo Tian roared, activating the Yin Fish above his head to hurl it at the golden gate. "Luo Tian, your grandfather's a fool! Can't you find someone else to torment!" The Yin Fish's voice echoed before colliding with the golden gate. Simultaneously, Luo Tian and Man Hun struck the gate again. A deafening roar erupted as the golden gate finally creaked open, blinding golden light spilling forth. Even Luo Tian and Man Hun instinctively closed their eyes. "Buzz..." The hum reverberated, waves surging from the gate to strike Luo Tian and Man Hun. Their bodies twisted before being sucked into the golden gateway. "Crack..." The golden gate closed slowly, and the hundred stone figures rushed into the surrounding immortal energy. Their massive forms collapsed, their internal immortal energy dispersing into Star River Mansion's vast aura. "Boom..." Luo Tian's body fell to the ground clumsily, dazed before rebounding with cautious eyes scanning his surroundings. A vast space stretched before him, five stone gates standing tall. Black mist veiled the gates, even Luo Tian unable to discern what lay within. Yet a profound sense of unease emanated from the black mist. "Welcome to Star River Mansion's disciple recruitment trial!" A voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. "Unexpectedly, someone managed to enter through the main gate!" The voice carried amusement, resonating in the empty space. "Who are you? Where's my friend?" Luo Tian called out, not seeing Man Hun or anyone else. "I am Star River Mansion's artifact spirit. All who enter Star River Mansion have the right to cultivate within it!" The voice returned, revealing nothing. "Star River Mansion?" Luo Tian furrowed his brow, unsure of this faction's nature. Yet the grandeur of the preceding events made it clear Star River Mansion was no ordinary force. "Once inside, there's no alternative—success makes you an outer disciple of Star River Mansion; failure means only death," the artifact spirit's voice returned, startling Luo Tian. "Did a group of people enter before us?" Luo Tian inquired cautiously, his gaze darkening. If Jiang Nanxuan and Jiang Sixi had perished, he could not bear it. "Indeed, a group entered. They're also undergoing trials. However, you differ from them—you entered alone, while they used special methods to bypass the first three trials and start at the fourth. Their trial is easier," the artifact spirit replied, slightly calming Luo Tian's mind. Chapter 1703: Star River Mansion Trial "Trial begins!" The low voice left no time for Luo Tian to ponder. A thunderous roar echoed in his ears, and a guttural snarl emerged from the black mist. Two red glows appeared in Luo Tian's vision. "Clatter..." The gray stone gates slowly lifted, their heavy sound echoing as if emerging from a dark abyss. Silver feet, crimson eyes, a towering figure with heavy breaths and swirling black mist—its body was wreathed in dark energy. A beast with a bull's head but standing upright like a human emerged from the darkness, clutching a gray stone axe. It strode toward Luo Tian. The bull-headed beast roared, sending an invisible wave from its mouth. Luo Tian's eyes flashed red before he leapt into action, dodging the beast's charge. He doubted that if struck by its silver horns, he would be impaled. "What the hell is this!" Luo Tian dodged, realizing the beast's strength rivaled a near-king. "This is one of Star River Mansion's bred beasts—this is the weakest level. Enjoy yourself, kid. I'll check on the others!" The artifact spirit's voice echoed in the dark space. "Why does my trial have to be harder than others!" Luo Tian cursed, dodging the bull-headed beast's attack. He dashed toward it. "Don't care what you are—just a near-king! I'll smash you!" Luo Tian's figure appeared before the towering beast, his fist etched with complex divine patterns striking its seemingly clumsy form. "Boom..." A dull sound echoed, and Luo Tian's body recoiled with a grimace. "This thing is as tough as the stone figures outside!" Luo Tian's face twisted in a bitter smile. He lunged again, undeterred by the beast's hardness. His body was no pushover; he had confidence in his flesh and bones. The previous strike had already cracked the beast's hide. "Boom... Boom..." Dull sounds echoed as Luo Tian dodged and countered, unwilling to be injured in the first trial. Time passed slowly. As Luo Tian wore down the beast, its crimson eyes dimmed, and its aura weakened. "Clatter..." Before Luo Tian could celebrate, another thunderous roar echoed in his ears. Bloodshot eyes emerged from the black mist—another stone gate spat out a massive bull-headed beast, charging toward Luo Tian. "Damn it!" Luo Tian's face darkened, dodging two beasts before eyeing the other three stone cells with a grim expression. If five emerged at once, he'd be overwhelmed. "Kill!" Luo Tian's tension spiked as he dashed toward the previously wounded beast. "Boom..." The thunderous sound returned, and a punch shattered the beast into blood mist. Meanwhile, another bull-headed beast swung its gray stone axe with a resonant hum, cleaving space into a streak of gray light that struck Luo Tian. "Puke..." Luo Tian felt his back tear open, flying backward to crash into an unopened stone cell. Blood spewed from his mouth as he wore a bitter smile, then saw the cold red glint in the darkness. "Damn it, so fast!" Luo Tian cursed, his body flipping mid-air as his wounds rapidly healed. He dashed toward the beast wielding the gray stone axe. A guttural roar echoed again, and the stone cell he collided with emitted a dull sound—another bull-headed beast, wreathed in ferocious energy, charged toward Luo Tian. Two beasts flanked him without leaving room to retreat. "Sever Heaven's Seal!" Luo Tian roared, a golden seal materializing above his head before plummeting. Simultaneously, he vanished from the collision path of the two beasts. "Boom..." The clumsy beasts failed to react, colliding with each other. "Taste this!" Luo Tian smiled, pressing his hands against the two beasts. The golden seal surged with overwhelming energy, striking them again. "Crack..." A brittle sound echoed as the two beasts collided and endured the seal, suffering heavy damage. "Roar..." Yet wounded, the beasts grew fiercer, their bloodshot eyes flashing madness as they stared at Luo Tian. "Boom..." A crackling sound echoed, and two red glows appeared in Luo Tian's vision. He barely reacted before silver horns gleamed with cold light, appearing before him. "Fast!" Luo Tian had no time to think, grabbing the two sharp silver horns. He was then hurled backward by the beast's massive body, crashing into an unknown wall. The silver horns nearly pierced his chest. "Roar..." Meanwhile, another beast raised its axe, swinging it downward toward Luo Tian, pinned to the wall. The gray axe radiated an aura capable of cleaving everything, descending upon Luo Tian's head. His face darkened as a strong sense of crisis surged through him. "Open!" Facing this overwhelming threat, Luo Tian dared not be careless. His blood surged, and his golden轮回 bridge erupted in his dantian, channeling the澎湃纪元之力 into his arms. Veins bulged as Luo Tian pushed aside the beast before him, sending it flying and leaving a deep groove on the ground. "Heaven's Will Thunder Sword!" Luo Tian had no time to think, raising his hand as lightning flashed. The Heaven's Will Thunder Sword materialized in his grasp, blocking the gray axe. A deafening collision echoed above Luo Tian's head. The gray axe flew from the beast's hand, and Luo Tian's feet plunged into the ground, lightning scattering before him. "Such immense strength!" Luo Tian's arms trembled, his face filled with awe. Had it not been for his formidable flesh and the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword, he might have suffered heavy injuries. "Sword Without Borders!" Luo Tian leapt from the ground, his face cold as he became a streak of light, dashing toward the retreated stone figure. Lightning flashed; the green sword pierced the beast's body, wrapping it in lightning energy. The massive form rapidly withered, collapsing to the ground before Luo Tian's eyes. "Buzz..." The sword hovered, and Luo Tian hesitated not a moment, its blade erupting with energy. The beast was split in two, blood staining the gray ground. Its corpse lay there without healing. "No blood regeneration—this is a relief!" Luo Tian sneered, charging toward the remaining beast. Meanwhile, the other two stone cells slowly opened, heavy energy echoing in space, making Luo Tian's face twitch. "Use secret treasures—difficulty doubles!" A distant voice echoed, making Luo Tian's mouth twitch. "Your mother! You didn't tell me I couldn't use epoch treasures!" Luo Tian roared into the empty space, his voice laced with委屈. "Roar..." Before Luo Tian's words faded, a furious roar shook his spirit. A suffocating pressure swept through the hall. A crimson bull-headed beast, three times taller than the previous two, emerged. Its body radiated a fiery aura, and it wielded a long axe that was entirely red. On the other side, an ice-cold bull-headed beast with a silver axe approached Luo Tian. "Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed, instinctively sensing these two were no pushovers. He vanished from the spot. "Boom... Boom..." As Luo Tian left, a fiery dragon and an icy one appeared on the ground. "Speed and power are twice as strong as before!" Luo Tian observed the deep grooves on the ground, his mouth twitching. "I'll endure!" Luo Tian wanted to curse but had no choice but to press on. Chapter 1704: Spoils "Divine King Nine Heavens Map!" Luo Tian roared, a golden map flying from his hands toward the crimson beast. Meanwhile, another golden seal thundered down to crush the ice-cold beast. The deafening collision echoed as Luo Tian's two signature techniques struck the massive bodies. Though these beasts were stronger and faster than before, their forms remained clumsy. "Buzz..." Yet Luo Tian forgot about the remaining beast; a gray axe sliced into his chest, creating a deep wound. "Take you to heaven!" Luo Tian's body flew backward, his form glowing with green energy before vanishing. The Heaven's Will Thunder Sword pierced the beast. With a guttural roar, its massive body collapsed to the ground, earning a smile from Luo Tian. "Idiot—still want to harm me, Luo Tian!" Luo Tian sneered, his feet moving with the幽冥鬼步 to weave around the two massive beasts. Yet he found no chance to attack; their clumsy forms were fast, giving him no opportunity for retaliation. Thunderous roars echoed as fire and ice dragons filled the space, soon overwhelming it. "Boom..." Luo Tian failed to dodge an icy dragon's tail, which struck him, sending a bone-chilling coldness through his body. The extreme cold slowed his movements. This delay allowed the two axes to strike him, collapsing his chest and wounding his abdomen. "What the hell is this!" Luo Tian felt his injuries, a bitter smile on his face as he fell to the wall. Seven-colored flames roamed within him, purging the bone-chilling coldness. "Roar..." A low growl echoed again as the two massive forms charged toward Luo Tian, a river of ice and a sea of fire trailing behind. Though their movements seemed slow, they arrived at Luo Tian's side instantly, colliding with him. Luo Tian had no time to recover; he vanished from the spot, his Heaven's Will Thunder Sword in hand. He channeled epoch energy into it. "Flash..." The green sword surged with overwhelming power, vanishing from Luo Tian's head to strike the crimson beast. "Puff..." The sharp sword pierced the beast's body. "Epoch treasure—epoch treasure!" Luo Tian smiled, but his expression turned incredulous. The Heaven's Will Thunder Sword, which had never failed before, halted within the beast's body, blood flowing down its blade. "How? The Heaven's Will Thunder Sword can't pierce this defense! What is this body made of!" Luo Tian trembled, his form dodging the ice-cold beast while wrapped in seven-colored flames. "Again!" At this point, Luo Tian no longer cared. He summoned the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword and poured epoch energy into it, reaching the threshold of "Sword Without Borders" before stopping. "The strongest strike—I won't let you escape!" Luo Tian's face was wild as the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword roared again, striking the crimson beast. Luo Tian dared not use the Rip Sky Spear; if he did, adding more difficulty would put him in real danger. Lightning flashed, the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword radiating ten thousand lights and piercing the crimson beast's throat. The sword's glow flashed, and in Luo Tian's expectation, the massive head fell to the ground. "Boom..." The colossal body collapsed, blood spurting from its neck. "Finally defeated one!" Luo Tian smiled, his face pale. Though his deep wounds hadn't healed, the bleeding had stopped. Dodging the ice-cold beast's attack, the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword returned to Luo Tian's head. Without hesitation, he poured more epoch energy into it. "Roar..." The ice-cold beast seemed to sense it was no match for Luo Tian, roaring upward. Invisible suction swept through the empty space, drawing in the blood that hadn't dried. Luo Tian's eyes widened. "What's happening!" He muttered, instantly pulled by the violent suction as if an invisible hand dragged him toward the ice-cold beast. Most shocking was the ice-cold beast's slow but powerful swing of its silver axe, radiating overwhelming energy. "Damn it!" Luo Tian's face broke into cold sweat as he controlled the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword while desperately resisting the terrifying suction. He hoped to escape before the ice-cold beast attacked. Blood continuously flowed into the ice-cold beast, its aura growing stronger. The silver axe radiated a devastating aura. "Go to hell! I'll fight you!" Luo Tian roared, his blood burning as he broke free from the suction. In that moment, the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword was launched. Meanwhile, the ice-cold beast completed its preparation, swinging its silver axe to cleave space and unleash a destructive aura toward Luo Tian. "Buzz..." The hum echoed, and almost instantly, the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword pierced the ice-cold beast's forehead. At the same time, the axe that could cut everything struck Luo Tian's waist. A wave of extreme pain invaded his body, a destructive force threatening to annihilate him. Divine blood spilled; the next moment, Luo Tian's body was split in two, falling to the ground. His gray soul, eyes filled with terror, floated out before rushing into his upper body. "Buzz..." The hum echoed again as the two halves of his body slowly healed. Luo Tian stood up, pale and breathing heavily, sweat pouring from his forehead. "His cultivation dropped!" Luo Tian's eyes carried bitterness. He felt his strength had declined, but he secretly rejoiced that his flesh and soul were strong enough. Otherwise, he would have been split in two by that axe. "This trial is so变态! What sect is Star River Mansion? A primordial era sect? No, it can't be. Could it be an immortal realm sect?" Luo Tian pondered as he sat cross-legged to recover. "First, restore my strength. Without recovery, I can't proceed to the next level!" Luo Tian looked at the fallen beast and took out a pill, closing his eyes to recover. In a simple room, an old man wore a puzzled expression. "So weak! Among so many people, no one has cultivated the Heaven's Will!" The old man muttered. "They can still regenerate blood, so they haven't reached the Heaven's Will stage. This kid is stronger than others but still far behind. It's been a long time since anyone entered. Why are these people so weak!" The old man was the artifact spirit of Star River Mansion, but his words carried deep confusion. "Let's see. Maybe someone will accidentally break through the Heaven's Will stage! But difficulty must decrease!" The old man shook his head. Time passed slowly. Though wounded, Luo Tian hadn't been turned into blood; he recovered quickly. Seven days later, he regained his strength. "Hmm?" Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. The beast corpses had vanished, and two cold glows appeared in his vision. "What is this?" Luo Tian stepped toward the glows and recognized what they were. "Horns? The ice-cold beast's horns!" Luo Tian extended his hand, feeling an icy sensation in his mind. At the same time, powerful energy surged into his body. "What is this? Immortal energy!" Luo Tian's eyes brightened, instantly recognizing the aura. He hadn't expected such benefits. Moreover, he could feel this immortal energy was much denser than the one obtained from defeating stone figures. While refining the two horns' immortal energy, Luo Tian's gaze swept around and lit on two crimson-hued horns lying on the ground, radiating a scorching aura. "After passing the trial, there are still good things to take!" Luo Tian sighed, his gaze turning toward the golden gate in the dark mist. "Of course! Star River Mansion never hoards resources for its disciples!" The artifact spirit's voice echoed before Luo Tian had finished speaking. Chapter 1705: Origin of Star River Mansion "Master, what kind of sect is Star River Mansion?" Luo Tian asked the old man before him, his face filled with confusion. "You don't know what sect Star River Mansion is?" The artifact spirit's face widened in disbelief, his eyes filled with incredulity. "You don't know what sect Star River Mansion is? Why did you participate in Star River Mansion's trial?" Before Luo Tian could react, the old man wore an expression of disbelief. "I just wanted to find my friend. I heard someone wanted to attack them!" Luo Tian shook his head, a bitter smile on his face. "Wait—answer me one question first: where are we?" The artifact spirit asked, his face puzzled. "This is the Star Luo Domain of the Nine Domains!" Luo Tian's face was confused, unsure why the artifact spirit suddenly asked this. "Nine Domains—where is it in the immortal realm?" The old man spoke again, making Luo Tian's face change. "What? Immortal realm! We're in the Nine Domains, not the immortal realm! To ascend, we must enter the immortal realm!" Luo Tian stared at the artifact spirit in bewilderment. "..." "Damn it, how did I end up in the Three Thousand Small Worlds!" The artifact spirit's face changed abruptly after hearing Luo Tian, then he spoke loudly. "Three Thousand Small Worlds?" Hearing the artifact spirit's words, Luo Tian wore a puzzled expression—he had never heard of this term before. "No mistake—my confusion about no Heaven's Will stage强者 is now clear. He must have entered the Three Thousand Small Worlds!" The artifact spirit cursed. "Master, what is the Three Thousand Small Worlds?" Luo Tian looked at the agitated artifact spirit of Star River Mansion and asked, feeling he had entered a remarkable trial. "The world you're in is called the Three Thousand Small Worlds. Once cultivators reach the Heaven's Will stage, they can ascend to the immortal realm!" "Many small worlds exist like yours. However, the final ascension destination is called the immortal realm!" The old man was懊恼 but spoke to Luo Tian. "The immortal realm—what is it like?" Hearing the old man's words, Luo Tian couldn't let go. He finally understood that Star River Mansion might have been a sect from the immortal realm used to recruit disciples. Due to some reason, it had ended up in the Nine Domains and eventually became a death trap in Star Luo Domain! "The immortal realm is a higher plane than your world. We, Star River Mansion, are one of the sects in the immortal realm!" The old man didn't hide anything, explaining to Luo Tian. Among those who entered, he found Luo Tian most likable. "It's truly an immortal sect!" Luo Tian's eyes lit up. Though becoming a disciple was still distant, he was curious about the immortal realm—after all, Gu Qianxue might have ascended there. "Correct. Perhaps it's what you call an immortal sect. After all, even an outer disciple of Star River Mansion is much stronger than you. The weakest is at the Heaven's Will stage!" The old man sighed softly. "Heaven's Will stage..." This was Luo Tian's first time hearing this realm, but he guessed it referred to the stage of becoming an epoch master or beyond. "Maybe your world calls this realm something else, but in the immortal realm, it's uniformly called Heaven's Will. It means being able to alter some rules!" "However, the Three Thousand Small Worlds differ from the immortal realm. Due to restrictions, those who ascend from the Three Thousand Small Worlds are very strong. In contrast, the immortal realm is different—those who reach Heaven's Will in the immortal realm are generally not as strong as those from the Three Thousand Small Worlds!" "Because the trials in the Three Thousand Small Worlds are much stronger, and the rules within small worlds are more restrictive. Those who reach Heaven's Will are usually the strongest in their respective small worlds!" The artifact spirit spoke, his voice carrying a sigh. "An epoch master should be a Heaven's Will stage powerhouse!" The old man's words clarified many of Luo Tian's doubts. "To become an immortal, first defy the heavens! The 'heavens' here refer to Heaven's Will!" Luo Tian recalled Gu Tianshu's words. Now he had the qualifications to touch this level. "Master, can you tell me what the immortal realm is like?" Luo Tian's face showed eagerness as he asked. "The immortal realm is divided into the Upper Three Heavens, Lower Three Heavens, and Middle Three Heavens. Star River Mansion is one of the top three sects in the Lower Middle Heaven. Don't be deceived by it being a lower heaven's top sect—many upper heaven sects dare not provoke Star River Mansion!" The old man smiled at Luo Tian. "The immortal realm is vast beyond your imagination. Take Heaven's Will stage cultivators—just to traverse the Lower Three Heavens, it takes twenty years!" "Moreover, the immortal realm's rules differ from your Three Thousand Small Worlds. They are heavily restricted. Even time flow is different—immortal realm one day equals your year! Thus, you live long in the small world but have a shortened lifespan in the immortal realm!" "Many who ascend from the small worlds die shortly after entering the immortal realm, unable to break through their cultivation. This often happens!" "To put it simply, the immortal realm is sometimes worse than the small world. The competition is brutal. Many ascendants find it hard to cope with the gap, their minds unable to adapt. After all, in small worlds they were invincible, but in the immortal realm, Heaven's Will is merely average!" The artifact spirit spoke softly. "It's better to stay in the Nine Domains then!" Luo Tian thought as he listened. "Are you thinking it's better to stay in the small world, being a head of a chicken rather than a tail of a phoenix?" The artifact spirit seemed to read Luo Tian's thoughts, his face showing a smile. "It's no use. When your cultivation reaches it, the Heaven's Will will notice you. There's only one path—ascend by defying the heavens!" The artifact spirit explained to Luo Tian. "Then, Master, what's beyond the Heaven's Will stage?" Seeing the artifact spirit was talkative, Luo Tian seized the chance to ask. "Beyond Heaven's Will stage is the Immortal Stage. Beyond that is True Immortal... In the immortal realm, those who reach True Immortal can dominate a region. They are top-tier power!" The artifact spirit explained to Luo Tian. "What about an Immortal King in the immortal realm?" Luo Tian asked the artifact spirit. "Immortal King..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, the artifact spirit's face turned respectful, his gaze on Luo Tian. "An Immortal King is a rare powerhouse in the immortal realm—essentially, they are rulers. According to my knowledge, there are only nine Immortal Kings residing in the Nine Sacred Mountains of the Upper Three Heavens!" The artifact spirit replied. "Damn it, this is truly a tiny ant!" Luo Tian's mouth twisted in bitterness, recalling his burden of the Heaven's Will Sect's blood feud. "Alright, young man, don't be too ambitious. An Immortal King in the immortal realm is like a Heaven's Will stage cultivator in the Three Thousand Small Worlds—respected by all!" "Now, your goal is to pass Star River Mansion's trial and ascend to the immortal realm. Once inside Star River Mansion, you'll have a powerful patron!" The artifact spirit smiled, bringing Luo Tian back to reality. "A patron!" Hearing the artifact spirit's words, Luo Tian's mouth twitched. If Star River Mansion knew he was a disciple of the Heaven's Will Sect, they might kill him first. "If I truly ascend to the immortal realm, I must hide the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword—exposing it would be a big trouble!" Luo Tian thought to himself, immediately concealing the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword. "Alright, I've talked too much. You should continue your trial. These four horns can enhance your strength. Hope you ascend to the immortal realm! If you pass the trial, obtaining an outer disciple's token will ensure no one dares to touch you upon your arrival!" The artifact spirit smiled, then vanished from Luo Tian's sight. "Master! I still have more to say! Since you're so optimistic about me, just let me pass!" Luo Tian roared into the empty hall. "Go to hell... kid, I'm just an artifact spirit! I can't change the rules!" A curse echoed in Luo Tian's ears. "Let me catch up with the others too!" Luo Tian protested, adopting a familiar tone. "Don't dream it. The rules are like this. Don't be greedy. I only told you so much because I felt sorry for you. Wanting to open a back door? There's no window!" The artifact spirit's voice returned, and no matter how Luo Tian called out, there was no response.
