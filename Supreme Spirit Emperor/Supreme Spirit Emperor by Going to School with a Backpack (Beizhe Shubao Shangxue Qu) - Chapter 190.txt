“Foolish youth! How do you fare? This is my final strike. If you cannot withstand it, today shall be your death!” The illusory figure of the Demon Clan’s Patriarch spoke softly, his voice brimming with confidence.

This enchanted lamp was said to have been crafted by a Sage during their final moments, using their own flesh and blood to forge it. Its black flames were ignited by the Sage’s essence, and its power was even more terrifying than celestial fire.

“Even a phantom with all one’s strength possesses such techniques. Indeed, Sages are no pushovers!”

“The sixth strike of the Seven Demon Blades—can I truly unleash it?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with intensity. His black demon sword rose high once more, and the swirling vortex of dark energy in his dantian churned ceaselessly. Waves of oppressive demonic aura coalesced upon the blade, growing denser and denser until its massive form pierced through the starry void.

“Sixth strike!” Nan Gong Yu Qing’s eyes lit with excitement. He fully understood the terrifying power of this sixth strike of the Reverse Heaven Seven Demon Blades. Once, Grand Elder had slain a Sage at the initial stage with this very strike.

Recalling that world-shattering might, Nan Gong Yu Qing’s heart pounded with exhilaration. He eagerly anticipated whether Luo Tian’s strike could slay a Sage at the initial stage. If it truly did, then Luo Tian would have truly defied fate.

“Woooooo!” A piercing hum resonated through the stars, and the black blade’s radiance drained Luo Tian of all his strength. This was his ultimate strike.

The colossal blade descended, resembling the executioner’s sword of a demon god, slicing toward the drifting black flames.

“Crash! Crash!” The firestorm roared like waves, and a thunderous sound echoed through the void. Under Luo Tian’s expectant gaze, the black blade clashed with the inferno.

Both forces bore apocalyptic might. Even a half-Sage would be hard-pressed to withstand their combined assault.

A terrifying surge radiated outward, scorching heat making even Luo Tian struggle to endure. Sweat trickled down his forehead.

Yet Luo Tian ignored the searing temperature, his eyes alight with surprise as he gazed at the magnificent spectacle before him.

In his view, the black firestorm was instantly split in two by the resplendent black blade. Towering waves of flame surged skyward, morphing into serpentine dragons that scattered in all directions.

Within moments, the black blade arrived before the Demon Clan’s Patriarch’s illusory form, causing his heart to tremble.

“Damn it! This still won’t work!” The Demon Clan’s Patriarch’s face contorted in shock. He had never expected that even after sacrificing his life essence, he would still be felled by this youth.

“Foolish youth! Wait for it!” The Demon Clan’s Patriarch regained his composure in an instant, smiling as he watched the black blade consume him.

The already weakened illusory form of the Demon Clan’s Patriarch could not withstand such a devastating attack. It vanished instantly, leaving behind a pale green enchanted lamp floating in the sky.

“Mission accomplished!” Nan Gong Yu Qing and Yu Xiongxin’s faces finally broke into smiles as they gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly amidst the stars.

“Luo Tian, it’s done. Return quickly—your wife is about to give birth!” Just as Luo Tian searched for Nan Gong Ling’s presence, Zhang Qiuyue’s voice echoed within his mind.

Chapter 869: Birth ( )

Amidst the endless stars, after eliminating the Demon Clan’s Patriarch’s projection, Luo Tian wore a cold expression as he scanned his surroundings for Nan Gong Ling.

Yet the stars were bleak and silent, revealing no trace of Nan Gong Ling.

“Has he fled?” Luo Tian’s face bore a cold expression, sighing inwardly at the old man’s swift escape. However, Luo Tian was not overly concerned; Nan Gong Ling held no threat now. What troubled him more was whether the Demon Clan would stir up further trouble after Nan Gong Ling returned.

“Let us hope it will subside for a while, giving the Tianyuan Continent time to grow!” Luo Tian murmured softly, his voice tinged with concern.

“Rest assured. The Divine Beast Domain isn’t just the Demon Clan. If they send their army, the Divine Beasts will surely seize this opportunity!” Nan Gong Yu Qing and Yu Xiongxin flew to Luo Tian’s side, speaking softly.

Hearing Nan Gong Yu Qing’s words, Luo Tian felt reassured. Indeed, the Tianyuan Continent was a tough nut to crack. If the Demon Clan truly sent an army, their base would be left vulnerable—perfect for the Divine Beasts to seize.

“Luo Tian, it’s done. Return quickly—Sisixi is about to give birth!” Zhang Qiuyue’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his body to tremble. He stood frozen beneath the stars.

“Sisixi is about to give birth! Haha!” After a brief moment of shock, Luo Tian burst into laughter, his voice filled with excitement and tension. He vanished from Nan Gong Yu Qing and Yu Xiongxin’s sight.

“Haha, let me guide you to familiarize yourself with the Tianyuan Continent. After all, we’ll be staying here for a while!” Nan Gong Yu Qing’s lips curled into a smile as he transformed into a streak of light, vanishing from the spot.

“Sigh… I wonder if this is good or bad!” Yu Xiongxin sighed, his face showing a bitter expression as he followed Nan Gong Yu Qing into the Tianyuan Continent.

...

In the Five Elements Sect of the Tianyuan Continent, an atmosphere of tension enveloped the entire sect. All Five Elements Sect disciples stood on high alert, patrolling its surroundings constantly, fearing anyone might disturb the birth of Jiang Sisixi within.

Luo Tian’s figure instantly appeared above the Five Elements Sect, causing the guards to tense up. Upon recognizing him as Luo Tian, their faces lit with smiles.

“Senior Brother Luo, I’ll congratulate you first!” The Five Elements Sect disciples, aware of Luo Tian’s nature, greeted him with smiles.

“Haha, thank you! Thank you! Once the child is born, don’t forget to give it New Year’s money!” Luo Tian laughed heartily and rushed into the sect's alchemy hall.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, each disciple’s lips twitched: “Blimey! A half-Sage like him asking for New Year’s money from us, the lowly Convergence Soul cultivators. That’s really shameless!”

The disciples muttered among themselves, yet each calculated what gift to give Luo Tian’s child.

Luo Tian dashed forward and finally arrived at the location of the Ice Extreme Island Luo family. As soon as he appeared, familiar figures emerged in his view.

“Luo Tian!” Seeing Luo Tian’s arrival, people’s faces lit with joy. It wasn’t because of his strength but due to their long-standing trust in him—Luo Tian had never let them down.

“You little scoundrel! How long have you been gone? Didn’t you know your wife is giving birth?” Luo Xiong slapped Luo Tian’s head, scolding him loudly. Yet one could see his mouth was stretched to his ears.

Indeed, Luo Xiong was the happiest upon hearing of Luo Tian’s child. Back on the Immortal Ancient Continent, he had been eager for Luo Tian to have children, showing how much he longed to see his grandchild.

“How is she?” Luo Tian ignored Luo Xiong’s slap and asked the surrounding people.

“Rest assured. You know her strength, right? Giving birth is nothing for you two! With your talents, the child will be no ordinary one!” Zheng Xin and others smiled, comforting Luo Tian’s anxious expression.

“Luo Tian, I’m poor. I don’t have much to give you. I’ll gift your child a formation, laying the foundation for its cultivation!” Wan Lengkong snorted. Among them, he was the poorest—after being hunted, he had practically nothing left.

Wan Lengkong’s words were barely finished when he waved his hand. Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine formation flags instantly surrounded the entire Five Elements Sect,凝聚 a terrifying original energy that transformed into a nine-colored light beam, rushing into the room where Jiang Sisixi was giving birth.

“Thank you!” Luo Tian smiled, clearly relieved that having a formation master like Wan Lengkong saved him much trouble.

“I guess I should prepare something for my child too!” Luo Tian smiled, his figure vanishing as he soared into the sky. A smile graced his face as he pointed a finger.

“Roar…” A series of earth-shaking roars echoed through the sky, causing the Five Elements Sect disciples to frown slightly. However, Zhang Qiuyue and Jiang Sisixi, who were fully focused on the birth, felt nothing.

A beast-shaped illusion of a bull-headed dragon appeared in the sky, causing people to startle and show confusion.

“This is the Prison Bull!” People on the Tianyuan Continent showed surprise upon seeing the beast-shaped illusion.

“Not just Prison Bull, but also Pixiu… and Taotie…” Roars echoed as more beast-shaped illusions appeared in people’s sight.

“What is this…?” Long Jie looked puzzled, a strange sense of familiarity stirring within him.

“Roar…” Nine illusions bowed respectfully to Luo Tian, then slightly bent their heads toward the ground where Long Jie stood.

“Thank you all!” Luo Tian spoke softly, pointing his finger. The nine illusions instantly rushed toward the room.

Indeed, Luo Tian had made his child born with a Nine Attribute Constitution. Though these attributes were of no use to him now, as he was about to enter the Sage realm, they were a precious opportunity for an untrained child—laying a solid foundation for his offspring.

Long Jie, standing on the ground, scowled. A strange sorrow filled his heart, making him appear somewhat sad.

“Just a Nine Attribute Constitution isn’t enough! My child, as long as he cultivates, I’ll make him soar!” Luo Tian smiled, biting his finger and letting three drops of blood fly from it.

Though Luo Tian was currently at the half-Sage level, these three drops of blood were precious. To anyone else, they would be a great nourishment.

Without hesitation, he pointed his finger, and the three drops of blood, radiating immense pressure, merged into Wan Lengkong’s formation.

After finishing this, Luo Tian descended and approached Long Jie, who wore a sad expression. Though others didn’t sense it, Luo Tian—connected to Long Jie in a special way—could feel the sorrow within him.

“Do you remember anything?” Luo Tian’s face bore a complex expression. With his current strength, he felt something was off about the nine illusions’ deaths and Long Jie’s reincarnation. Yet, he didn’t know where to start; otherwise, the Dragon Clan wouldn’t have been so oppressed in a small Four Sacred Star Domain and suffered such despair.

“No, I just feel sad,” Long Jie shook his head lightly. He had no recollection.

Luo Tian said nothing, gently patted Long Jie’s shoulder. He didn’t intend to share his suspicions with Long Jie. To Luo Tian, Long Jie was always a child—his adorable dragon cub back then.

“Wooooo…” A powerful surge appeared in everyone’s perception. An energy vortex formed above the Five Elements Sect, slowly spreading outward. The sky over the Five Elements Sect darkened with clouds, and violent lightning rolled within them.

“Waaaaa!” A cry echoed through the silent Five Elements Sect. A golden lightning bolt streaked across the sky, rushing toward Jiang Sisixi’s room, causing people to change expressions.

“Unbelievable! Legends say that certain extraordinary beings’ births bring down thunderstorms. We’ve witnessed it today!” Wan Lengkong’s face showed awe, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Haha! Just a mere thunderstorm? How dare it harm my child! Return!” Luo Tian sneered, his voice cold as a decree. He rushed into the sky.

His words were law. The golden lightning dragon vanished instantly, transforming into a stream of lightning energy that disappeared into the sky.

“Crash! Crash…” Energy rain slowly descended, watering every corner of the Tianyuan Continent and nurturing all living beings.

“Haha…” A laugh made people’s expressions shift. Zhang Qiuyue smiled, cradling a baby in her arms as she appeared before the crowd. Jiang Sisixi, pale-faced, followed behind Zhang Qiuyue.

“Ah! This little one is so adorable!” People surrounded Zhang Qiuyue, but none stepped forward. They only gazed at the baby in her arms, finding it increasingly endearing.

“But why is this little one smiling? Newborns should be crying, right?” People looked at Zhang Qiuyue’s baby with confusion.

Chapter 870: Luo Xiting ( )

In the Five Elements Sect of the Tianyuan Continent, a joyous atmosphere filled the place. Everyone surrounded Zhang Qiuyue as Luo Nantian became overjoyed, never expecting to become a grandfather so quickly.

“Give it to me!” Luo Nantian rushed toward Zhang Qiuyue instantly, his face filled with endless affection as he gazed at the little girl in her arms.

Luo Nantian’s speed was fast, but someone was faster. Luo Xiong’s aged figure appeared before Luo Nantian, snatching him away with a slap: “It’s not your turn!”

Luo Nantian was knocked back by Luo Xiong’s slap, his face showing a pained expression. He looked at Luo Xiong: “This is ridiculous! I don’t even have the right to hold my grandson!”

Fearing anger, Zhang Qiuyue carefully handed the baby to Luo Xiong.

Luo Xiong, a shrewd figure, now wore an expression of joy. He gently cradled the baby in his arms with a foolish smile, causing people to chuckle.

“Grandpa, be good! Say grandpa!” Luo Xiong spoke softly to the baby in his arms, voice filled with endless tenderness.

“Father, this child just was born. How can it talk?” Luo Nantian stood before Luo Xiong, complaining.

“Come on, say grandpa!” After saying this, Luo Xiong approached the baby with a sly face and spoke softly.

Luo Xiong glared at Luo Nantian. If not for fear of scaring his grandchild with a loud reprimand, he would have already shouted at him.

People were speechless watching this father-son pair. They shook their heads lightly.

“Grandpa… Grandpa…” But in an instant, a childish voice echoed in people’s ears. Their eyes widened instantly, looking at the baby cradled by Luo Xiong with disbelief.

The baby had no speech, yet was lively and agile. It rubbed against Luo Xiong’s chest to find a comfortable position.

Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian, an old man and a young one, stared wide-eyed. Then both laughed heartily, though without making a sound. If someone didn’t know their situation, they might think the two were mad.

“Hmph! Luo Tian, your daughter is no ordinary child. She can already speak at birth. I feel she might be even more extraordinary than you!” Zheng Xin and others smiled, congratulating Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood among the crowd, his gaze fixed on his daughter. A sense of blood connection stirred within him, evoking an inexplicable feeling.

He walked toward Jiang Sisixi and gently took her hand, speaking only for the two of them: “You’ve worked hard!”

Jiang Sisixi, not minding others, leaned on Luo Tian’s shoulder: “Let’s name the child!”

Jiang Sisixi’s words weren’t hidden from others. Upon hearing this, Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian showed a moment of awkwardness. They had been too excited to notice that Luo Tian hadn’t held the child yet, their faces turning red as they approached Luo Tian.

“Hey, Tian’er, come hold her. After all, you are the father!” Luo Xiong, with great reluctance, handed the baby to Luo Tian’s arms. Luo Tian smiled.

“Dad… dad… hold…” The baby’s childish voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making him emotional. His heart even felt a bit nervous—more so than when he faced two Sage-level opponents.

But the baby’s actions soon made Luo Tian’s face darken. The baby in Luo Xiong’s arms flapped her tiny hands repeatedly, looking at Long Jie with a longing gaze.

“Damn! What’s going on!” People were confused by the baby’s intention, looking at Long Jie who stood motionless with disbelief.

Long Jie was also stunned. His face turned red, and he looked confused at Luo Tian, not understanding why the baby called him dad. This was truly a trap.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness, not because he doubted Long Jie. After all, the baby was his—this he could confirm. But the only issue with this situation was the Nine Illusions.

Luo Tian feared nothing, but he feared that his newborn child might be possessed by one of the Nine Illusions’残魂. If so, he would never forgive himself.

However, after a long sigh, Luo Tian smiled lightly. His worries were unnecessary. What level was he at? No one could possess his child under his watch, not even a Sage.

“Hold her!” Luo Tian gently patted Long Jie’s shoulder. He knew it was likely the Nine Illusions’ energy that made the baby feel a natural affinity for Long Jie.

“Ah…” Long Jie realized something from the nine illusions he had felt before. His youthful face seemed to understand something, and under Zhang Qiuyue’s guidance, he cradled the baby in his arms.

“Haha…” As soon as she was in Long Jie’s arms, the baby smiled, feeling unusually comfortable. Her body radiated a glow.

Long Jie also smiled, holding the baby for a while. Yet he didn’t feel his eyes welling up with tears that fell onto the baby’s face, causing her to frown slightly.

“Alright, you’re holding it for too long. I can let you be the godfather, but are you going to give her back now?” Luo Tian’s face finally showed impatience as he saw Long Jie wouldn’t let go.

Long Jie smiled awkwardly, reluctantly handing the baby back to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian took the child into his arms, smiling gently: “Little one, I am your real father!”

“Ah…” The baby seemed tired from being passed around. Her face showed displeasure, yawned, and fell asleep in Luo Tian’s arms.

“Alright, let’s think about the child’s name. As a father, you should have thought of it long ago. Now you’re thinking!” Jiang Sisixi smiled gently, taking the baby who was now snoring and glared at Luo Tian.

“I had already thought of it. Luoxinxin, how about that?” Luo Xiong smiled proudly, looking at everyone, clearly satisfied with his chosen name.

“No, she is Luoxiting!” Luo Tian’s face showed no expression. His eyes held a hint of sorrow as he spoke softly.

“You little…” Hearing Luo Tian’s rejection, Luo Xiong was clearly upset. He wanted to speak but was stopped by Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, those who knew the situation fell silent. They all sighed deeply, looking at Luo Tian without knowing how to speak.

“What’s going on?” Luo Xiong, having lived so long, was a shrewd man. Seeing everyone’s expressions, he knew something was wrong. He whispered to Luo Nantian.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue were afraid that Luo Xiong’s temper would cause trouble. They looked at Luo Tian with concern and told Luo Xiong about Chen Yunting’s situation.

“Sigh… I never thought Tian’er would still be holding on!” Zhang Qiuyue sighed, looking at Luo Tian.

Jiang Sisixi gently held Luo Tian’s hand without speaking. Her comfort was evident.

“Alright, I’m fine. Grandpa, father, mother—should we plan a full moon banquet for Xiting?” Luo Tian’s face returned to normal, his eyes filled with a smile as he spoke to Luo Xiong.

“Haha! Right, rest assured. We’ll take care of it!” Zheng Xin and others sighed in relief upon seeing Luo Tian return to normal, continuing the celebration.

Outside the crowd, Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan held hands, their faces showing a hint of envy. They watched Luo Tian and Jiang Sisixi standing together, looking like a happy family of three. Their eyes showed a touch of loneliness as they silently left.

“Qianxue, Qiuchan!” Jiang Sisixi noticed something and felt a bit of guilt. She rushed out of the crowd with Luoxiting in her arms to approach Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

“Sisixi, sister!” After months of coexistence, the three had become good friends. But upon seeing Jiang Sisixi’s baby, Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan felt uneasy. They forced a smile.

“Ah!” Luo Tian slapped his head, feeling guilty for only thinking about the child and forgetting these two girls.

He quickly rushed to Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan: “Qianxue, Qiuchan, I’m sorry. I…”

Luo Tian’s words hadn’t finished when Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan snorted, their voices cold. They ignored Luo Tian and pushed through the crowd.

“Qianxue, Qiuchan! Listen to me!” Luo Tian didn’t want these two girls to misunderstand. He instantly appeared before them, grabbing both with his arms without their consent.

“Forgive me!” Luo Tian knew these two girls must have known everything during his injury. He directly admitted his mistake.

“Why, let go of me…” Being held by Luo Tian in front of so many people, the two girls were uncomfortable. Their faces turned red like ripe apples, making Luo Tian’s eyes go straight.

“You forgive me, I’ll let go!” Luo Tian smiled, his arms tightly wrapping around the two girls. He naturally knew this was the best opportunity; otherwise, he wouldn’t know how to please them.

“Let go first…”

“I won’t let go…” The three of them kept wriggling, causing people to smile.

“Tian’er, you must marry these two daughters-in-law for me. You’re both grown up now. You have a child already. Let’s have double joy and get married!” Luo Nantian smiled, seizing the moment to finalize Luo Tian’s marriage.

Hearing Luo Nantian’s words, Luo Tian and the two girls froze. Their eyes met each other.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan knew Luo Tian didn’t want to marry, as they understood his lingering attachment to Chen Yunting.

Chapter 871: The Second Grand Wedding

In the Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian tightly held Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan in his arms. Their eyes met.

“Foolish youth, do you want them to wait for you forever?” Luo Nantian’s face bore a serious expression, his gaze on Luo Tian.

Luo Tian and the two girls trembled. They knew Luo Tian had always wanted to find Chen Yunting, so he hadn’t given the two girls a complete wedding. Back on the Immortal Ancient Continent, it had also been ruined.

Luo Tian remained silent but didn’t loosen his arms. His face showed contemplation, eyes slightly closed.

The two girls dared not disturb him and only blushed, allowing themselves to be held by Luo Tian while being observed by the crowd.

“We should get married!” Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze filled with tenderness as he looked at Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

“We can wait!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the two girls felt excitement but restrained it. They remembered Luo Tian’s obsession with Chen Yunting and spoke against it.

“Two foolish girls, I was about to marry this girl. I’ve already owed a debt to Yunting. I can’t owe you two either. Are you unwilling to marry me?” Luo Tian resisted the urge to kiss them both, speaking to Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

“Willing!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the two girls nodded shyly in his arms. Their long-anticipated wish was finally decided; they had forgotten why they were angry.

Luo Tian couldn’t resist any longer and kissed both girls on their blushing faces.

“Sss…” After kissing, Luo Tian’s ears were pulled by the two girls.

“I warn you, Sisixi is the last one. If you have anyone else, don’t blame us three sisters for being unkind!”

“Right! You went out and had a child already. Next time, are you going to bring back a five or six-year-old kid?” The two girls took turns scolding Luo Tian, pulling him to Jiang Sisixi’s side.

“Sisixi, persuade Qianxue and Qiuchan for me!” Luo Tian’s face turned red. He couldn’t resist the two girls’ strength, so he asked Jiang Sisixi to beg for mercy.

“Qianxue and Qiuchan are right!” Jiang Sisixi held the baby with one hand and pinched Luo Tian’s waist with the other, smiling obviously not wanting to side with Luo Tian.

“Haha! I never thought Luo Tian would be in this situation. Truly, one thing overcomes another!” People laughed and left, not wanting to disturb the four people who had finally reunited.

Of course, with Luo Tian’s decision, people began preparing for his wedding. After all, it was a big event. No one could afford to be careless.

In the end, Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian decided to hold the wedding twelve days later on the ninth day of the ninth month, symbolizing longevity.

Although twelve days was tight, it wasn’t a problem with the Five Elements Sect and Tianyuan Sect’s disciples. If Luo Tian wished, even one day would be enough to hold a grand wedding.

Luo Tian’s wedding caused a frenzy across the Tianyuan Continent. His name was known to all, and soon every sect received news of his wedding, preparing gifts for the celebration.

Not only did it spread across the Tianyuan Continent but also throughout the Four Sacred Star Domains. The Tianyuan Continent was at its peak, and soon, a batch of strong figures from other continents arrived.

The Tianyuan Continent became lively. Though it was lively, no sect dared to cause trouble on the Tianyuan Continent, just like the previous Heavenly God Continent’s sect competition. Even rival sects were polite and didn’t dare to fight.

The two major sects, the White Tiger Sect’s Chen Xuanning and the Xuanwu Elder Tortoise, as well as the Azure Dragon Sect’s Sha Cangmang, personally arrived to congratulate Luo Tian on his wedding.

The Five Elements Sect was piled high with gifts. The disciples receiving the gifts felt their arms were sore.

“My… all mine… hahaha…” Amidst the mountain of gifts, a tiny figure rolled and crawled toward its little chest.

“Xiting, slow down. It’s all yours; no one is competing with you!” Zhang Qiuyue smiled, picking up the baby who had only been born twelve days ago and handed her to Long Jie. After all, today was the wedding day of Luo Tian, and she, as a mother, couldn’t miss it.

“Tian Dao Sect’s Grandmaster Zhang Ziping, Elder Lei Yongjichen arrived… Thunder Sect’s Grandmaster Ying Hongtu… Tian Jian Sect’s Grandmaster… You Ming Sect…” As the messengers kept announcing, familiar faces appeared in the Five Elements Sect again.

Some had been Luo Tian’s rivals; others were his life-and-death brothers. Now, they were all friends of Luo Tian, the backbone of the Tianyuan Continent, coming to congratulate him.

Seeing these familiar faces, Luo Tian’s eyes showed admiration. He slowly stepped onto the high platform prepared for him.

The wedding was officiated by Lu Kunpeng, a role only he could fulfill. After all, Lu Kunpeng was almost Luo Tian’s half-mentor.

On the high platform, Luo Nantian and his wife, Long Jie’s father Long Hongcai, Gu Qianxue’s parents Gu Yun, and others sat there. Their faces showed admiration, eyes filled with satisfaction as they watched Luo Tian step onto the platform.

“Alright, I won’t introduce further. Everyone knows who is getting married today. Cultivators don’t care about formalities; no one wants to wait long. I won’t be verbose. Let’s bring the three brides up!” Lu Kunpeng smiled, addressing the crowd gathered in the sky or on the ground around the Five Elements Sect.

As people nodded in agreement, three beautiful figures appeared before everyone. Luo Tian’s eyes softened.

Three women—each a rare beauty. Marrying one would be a blessing. Luo Tian felt guilty for owing too much to three women.

The familiar scene made Luo Tian recall his previous marriage on the Immortal Ancient Continent. He was quite at ease with the procedures. After completing them, the three women were escorted into rooms in the Five Elements Sect’s back mountains.

The rest was toasting. Luo Tian looked at the thousands of people and grimaced inwardly, sighing: “What year is this? Let me not even have a wedding night!”

But Luo Tian was no ordinary person. He smiled and symbolically toasted some people close to him before nightfall. He calculated that he had only toasted a tenth of the crowd, and if this continued, his wedding night would be ruined.

The thought of three beautiful wives waiting for him made Luo Tian’s lower abdomen hot. He had no patience to toast.

He glanced around and waved his hand, causing wine jars to fly into the sky. They shattered, and clear wine gathered under Luo Tian’s control into a river-like stream under the starlight.

“Too many people. I won’t toast everyone. I’ll drink this myself; you all can have your fill!” Luo Tian smiled and drank the river-like wine in one gulp.

“Hmph! A half-Sage level person is indeed different. This is specially made for cultivators. Even a Convergence Soul-level person would get drunk after one jar!” Gu Lei said, his eyes filled with admiration. This was the first time he had shown respect for Luo Tian.

These wines were made by Gu Lei himself. He naturally knew that regular wine couldn’t make a strong cultivator drunk. That was why he added some ingredients. Yet Luo Tian had consumed so much.

“Damn it! Why didn’t you say that earlier!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly upon hearing Gu Lei’s words. His face turned slightly red. Though he wasn’t drunk, he felt a bit light-headed and slowly landed on the ground.

“Hey everyone! Just have fun. I’m drunk, so I’ll rest now!” Luo Tian waved his fists to the crowd and walked toward the back mountains.

“Hmph! Truly, Luo Tian is no ordinary person. He’s still not drunk and pretending to be!” People looked at the wobbly Luo Tian with admiration as he walked toward the back mountains. Then, they returned to a joyous atmosphere.

Hearing people’s words, Luo Tian almost fell to the ground. He cursed Gu Lei inwardly and arrived at the back mountains, where his wedding chamber was arranged. His face was tense with excitement from the wine. He saw all three rooms were lit, and he felt a bit conflicted about which one to enter first.

“Damn it! Who arranged this? Why not put them in one room!” Luo Tian cursed and headed for the first room.

As he entered, his eyes showed a smile. Gu Qianxue was seated on the bed, her face shyly blushing. Luo Tian stood there for a moment before approaching her.

“Indeed, Qianxue was my first woman. She should be the first!” Luo Tian nodded inwardly, his eyes softening as he embraced Gu Qianxue: “My wife, let’s rest. Haha!”

Luo Tian laughed and began to remove his clothes but was stopped by Gu Qianxue.

“Luo Tian, you once married me in the Immortal Ancient Ruins. I was satisfied. Though we didn’t have marital relations, from that moment on, I considered myself your wife. Tonight is important. You haven’t given Qiuchan and Sisixi anything yet. I won’t compete with them tonight. Listen, go to their rooms. Whichever you choose is up to you!” Gu Qianxue spoke passionately, her eyes filled with tenderness as she addressed Luo Tian.
