The entire Blood Demon Glazed Bee clan launched a suicidal strike, yet Diao Yuanshan cracked it within such a short time—this was enough for the Bee King to recognize Diao Yuanshan's power as capable of defying heaven itself.

"Die!" Diao Yuanshan's face bore a calm expression as he waved his hand, unleashing a surge of violet sacred power that manifested into a colossal purple hand, slamming toward the Bee King. A Bee King at the peak of Sagehood was no match for Diao Yuanshan, who regarded it as a being easily crushed with one palm.

"Wow, what's this old man’s power!" Yan Jun transformed into his true form, his black eyes filled with awe as he watched Diao Yuanshan's casual strike radiate apocalyptic might, his voice laced with reverence.

"Half-Step of the Epoch!" Xu Liyi's eyes gleamed with pride as he addressed Yan Jun, his tone flirtatious, as if the one who could crush a Sage Peak powerhouse with a single palm was his own creation.

"Die! If I had completed my transformation, killing you would be effortless!" The Bee King's eyes burned with madness as he roared, his blood energy surged forth, his sword intent towering high. He launched three swords toward Diao Yuanshan's hand.

"Unfortunately, you haven't completed your transformation!" Diao Yuanshan observed the Bee King's three swords with a flicker of surprise before his body flashed like lightning, becoming a streak of violet light that materialized before the Bee King. His purple fist smashed into the Bee King's body.

"Boom..." The collision of three sword glows and the violet hand produced a deafening roar, its shockwave sending Luotian and the others flying thousands of feet. Had Diao Yuanshan not summoned a streak of violet qi to shield them, their fragile bodies would have shattered under the impact.

"Boom..." As the violet hand clashed with the three sword glows, Diao Yuanshan's fist struck the Bee King's body, producing a muffled sound.

Diao Yuanshan's speed was unparalleled; having activated the幽冥鬼步 (Yin-Shadow Ghost Step), his velocity had reached its peak. Even the Bee King at Sage Peak couldn't react in time, and Diao Yuanshan's fist struck him squarely.

"Crack..." The Bee King's body cracked, transforming into human form before being hurled backward. His body bore deep fissures as he gradually reverted to his true form, a Blood Demon Glazed Bee the size of an adult's arm.

"Still alive?" Diao Yuanshan's face flickered with surprise. He hadn't expected his punch to merely wound the Bee King instead of killing him.

"I'll end you!" The Bee King transformed into his true form, shouting as he unleashed an overwhelming aura. His crimson wings trembled, and simultaneously, another hive on the Inexorable Life-and-Death Bamboo began to sway, detaching itself and hovering above the Bee King's head.

"Go!" The Bee King spat out a stream of blood energy into the hive, which emitted a resonant hum. The hive gradually transformed into a spectral form of Blood Demon Glazed Bees, rushing toward Diao Yuanshan.

"Strange thing! Though its power surpasses a pseudo-Epoch Treasure, it's still not enough to harm me!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes flashed with disdain. He didn't even bother using a technique, instead striking twice with his hands, scattering the spectral bees. Finally, he launched a punch that shattered the hive.

"Boom..." The explosion echoed as the hive—which had only managed to move a corner of it—was reduced to pieces before Diao Yuanshan's might.

"Powerful! This is the strength of a Half-Step of the Epoch!" Luotian's eyes widened in awe. This was his first time witnessing Diao Yuanshan's true power, where each strike was a casual palm-slap that ended lives without effort.

"This Bee King is no pushover; it's lasted this long against Master Diao!" Xu Liyi's eyes carried admiration.

"Of course! I heard the ancestors of these Blood Demon Glazed Bees were formidable figures. They once stood against our ancestor in the struggle for the Epoch Lord's throne, only to be crushed by our forebear!" Yan Jun's black eyes gleamed with admiration. The Star Dragon Ants and Blood Demon Glazed Bees were natural enemies, yet now it seemed the latter's clan would be eradicated. Yan Jun felt no joy but a lingering melancholy.

"Kid, how do you thank us? Without the Blood Demon Glazed Bees, this bamboo forest is yours!" Xu Liyi's eyes held a smile as he gazed at Yan Jun.

"Human, this is your doing!" The Bee King's voice carried madness as his wings flapped, lifting him into the sky. His body radiated blood energy, enveloping the shattered hive.

"Buzz..." The crimson aura carried potent refining power, absorbing Diao Yuanshan's shattered hive and transforming it into a crimson liquid, which the Bee King absorbed.

Meanwhile, the liquid formed from the hive Luotian had burned with Emerald Crystal Glazed Fire also slowly rose from the ground, flowing toward the Bee King.

In an instant, the Bee King absorbed both crimson liquids into his body. His aura gradually ascended.

"It has reached Half-Step of the Epoch!" Luotian's face bore shock as he stared at the crimson Bee King. At the same time, he and Xu Liyi and Yan Jun retreated ten thousand feet.

Chapter 1097: The Bee King's Tail Needle

Within the bamboo forest, Diao Yuanshan and the Bee King's battle had carved out a vast clearing. Only two Inexorable Life-and-Death Bamboos remained, wrapped in Diao Yuanshan's violet aura and untouched by their clash.

Luotian, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun stood in awe, watching the battle of a Half-Step of the Epoch.

"I'll end you!" The Bee King, now the size of an adult's arm, bore a grotesque and mad expression. After absorbing two hives, his aura surged wildly, his eyes turning crimson.

"Half-Step of the Epoch?" Diao Yuanshan's brow furrowed slightly, his eyes darkening with concern. He waved his hand, summoning a violet long sword—his pseudo-Epoch Treasure. Though Diao Yuanshan's power was immense, he had rarely used this sword over the years.

"Master Diao has finally drawn his weapon!" Xu Liyi whispered, concern in his eyes. In the Nine Realms' current state, only a handful of people could force Diao Yuanshan to wield his weapon besides the domain masters.

"You'll die!" The Bee King's aura was terrifying as he transformed into human form, his blood-red sword clutched in hand.

"Merely using a special method to reach Half-Step of the Epoch. Though troublesome, it's still no match for me!" Diao Yuanshan smiled as his body flashed into a streak of violet lightning. The long sword materialized in his hand, slicing toward the Bee King.

After reaching Half-Step of the Epoch, the Bee King's confidence had grown. His blood-red sword radiated ten thousand feet of light, transformed into a crimson glassy blade held before him.

"Crack..." Red and violet lightning clashed, resonating with divine voices. The crimson glassy sword hummed as the Bee King stood ten thousand feet away.

The Bee King's face paled slightly. Even with the secret of fusing two hives, he still couldn't match Diao Yuanshan. Blood spewed from his mouth.

"Ten Thousand Swords Piercing the Heart!" The Bee King roared, launching his crimson glassy sword. He chanted seals while spitting blood energy into the blade.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed as the sword split into two, then four, forming ten thousand eight hundred swords that rushed toward Diao Yuanshan.

"Powerful technique. Each sword could kill a Sage at the peak of their era! This is the strength of Half-Step of the Epoch!" Xu Liyi marveled as he watched the glassy swords swirling through the sky.

"Too great a gap. I wonder how terrifying true Epoch masters are!" Luotian's eyes held yearning, yet a shadow of worry crept in. If even Half-Step of the Epoch was beyond his capacity, how could he face the hidden strengths of the Divine Race?

"Get out..." Diao Yuanshan's expression remained calm as he faced the overwhelming sword attack. He roared, his voice shaking mountains. His violet long sword hummed, its blade piercing through the heavens, forming an endless storm that clashed with the Bee King's ten thousand eight hundred swords.

"God-Slaying Slash!" Diao Yuanshan finally unleashed his technique, the violet blade descending.

"Boom..." The deafening roar echoed as the blade collided with the sword storm.

"Bee King's Dominion!" As the Bee King saw his swords being cut down, his eyes flashed with boundless light. Blood energy surged from his body into the sword.

"Eastern Purple Qi! Vast and Boundless!" Diao Yuanshan's hands moved, violet energy spreading throughout the bamboo forest. The vast purple qi formed a towering flood that subdued the swords, evolving into three thousand Dao paths to block the ten thousand eight hundred blades.

"Yin-Shadow Ghost Step!" Diao Yuanshan's body flickered, violet energy rising beneath his feet. He flashed toward the Bee King again.

"Kill!" The Bee King, seeing Diao Yuanshan approaching, no longer transformed into human form. His crystalline wings flapped as he collided with Diao Yuanshan without retreating.

Above, the violet flood continuously churned the ten thousand eight hundred swords. Beneath it, Diao Yuanshan stood as a sovereign, his Eastern Purple Qi technique endlessly unleashed against the Bee King in a life-or-death battle.

Luotian and his companions stared in awe, their eyes filled with enlightenment. The two combatants moved at such speed that even Luotian could only track their movements with his Purple Demon Eye.

"Three Thousand Dao Paths!" Luotian marveled, each collision containing the essence of Dao and Principle. Without understanding some Dao paths, he would never have noticed the terrifying power hidden within their seemingly ordinary attacks.

This was Luotian's first time witnessing a Half-Step of the Epoch battle. For him, it was an invaluable opportunity for enlightenment, his eyes fixed on Diao Yuanshan and the Bee King's clash.

"Only now do I understand how to use it!" Xu Liyi's forehead split open, revealing a black eye. Clearly, he could also perceive the essence of their battle.

"Powerful! I've never seen such a strong person before. Even the Bee King is being pushed back!" Yan Jun, transformed into his true form, had emerald eyes but couldn't hide the awe in them.

"Master Diao is truly powerful, managing to suppress this Bee King!" Xu Liyi murmured.

"If I'm not mistaken, Master Diao is letting us witness this Half-Step of the Epoch battle. Such an opportunity isn't common!" Luotian's eyes remained fixed, his voice low before falling silent, watching the battle intently.

"Dao and Principle interwoven. Three Thousand Dao Paths!" Luotian whispered, his hands constantly forming strange energies as the aura of Dao spread and gradually became complete.

"What is this!" Yan Jun's eyes widened in shock as he watched the strange aura forming from Luotian's hands.

"Awakening Dao! This kid is awakening Dao!" Xu Liyi exclaimed, his eyes filled with shock. He didn't know this was Luotian's second awakening.

Previously, when Luotian faced the Demon Race, he had already grasped two thousand Dao paths. Now, as he observed Diao Yuanshan and the Bee King's battle, filled with Dao and Principle, Luotian gradually gained enlightenment, refining his own Dao.

"His talent is truly high!" Diao Yuanshan's face bore admiration as he glanced at Luotian and the others, his heart filled with awe.

Meanwhile, the Bee King was utterly crushed by Diao Yuanshan's power. He couldn't even breathe, realizing the vast gap between them.

At this moment, the Bee King wanted to flee. He was no match for Diao Yuanshan and felt that Diao Yuanshan hadn't used his full strength, merely allowing the boy to gain more Dao insights. If Diao Yuanshan had fought with all his might, he wouldn't have lasted a single minute.

"Go!" The Bee King's face hardened. His wings flapped rapidly, his body flashing like lightning toward the distance.

"Return! It's over!" Though the Bee King was fast, he couldn't match Diao Yuanshan. A streak of violet light appeared in his path, and a massive hand slammed down.

"Boom..." The violet hand struck the Bee King's body, sending him crashing into the ground like a ball.

"Eastern Purple Qi!" Diao Yuanshan's hands moved, and the vast purple qi surged into the deep pit created by the Bee King.

"Even if I die, I'll take you with me!" The Bee King's cold voice echoed within the pit.

The hum of a blood-red light arrow surged from the purple qi, flying out at an incredible speed with piercing power. Even Diao Yuanshan hadn't reacted in time.

Diao Yuanshan's eyes flashed with a streak of violet as he hastily raised a purple shield before him.

But the blood arrow was too fast. In an instant, it pierced Diao Yuanshan's chest, a one-foot-long blood arrow embedding itself halfway into his body. Diao Yuanshan's face turned grim as he pulled the arrow from his chest and crushed it with a single hand, turning it into dust that fell to the ground.

"Zhi..." The blood arrow's dust touched the ground, causing a wave of white smoke. Its corrosive power turned Diao Yuanshan's feet blood-red.

"Trouble!" Yan Jun's small eyes widened with intense fear as he exclaimed, transforming into human form and rushing to Diao Yuanshan's side.

"Senior!" Yan Jun supported Diao Yuanshan, whose body swayed slightly. His eyes carried worry.

Having long dealt with the Blood Demon Glazed Bees, Yan Jun naturally knew what that blood arrow was—a tail stinger each Bee could use once. It wasn't just powerful but also contained an unparalleled poison capable of killing opponents of the same level.

"Ha! Old man, how does this poison taste?" The Bee King's mad voice echoed from the pit.

"Cough... cough..." Diao Yuanshan coughed twice, his mind cursing himself for being careless. His gaze toward the Bee King now carried intense caution.

"Though I'm dying, having you as a companion in death is worth it. And these three young ones too!" The Bee King, like a last-ditch effort, roared toward Diao Yuanshan. Though his aura had weakened, he still rushed forward.

Chapter 1098: Battle Against the Bee King

Within the vacuum of the bamboo forest, the Bee King's weakened form still radiated overwhelming energy as he rushed toward Diao Yuanshan, his blood energy surging to attack the poisoned Diao Yuanshan.

"Old man! Even if I die, I'll watch you die first!" Though the Bee King's aura had weakened, he still rushed toward Diao Yuanshan. He knew Diao Yuanshan's current state was worse than his own.

"Dangerous!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes flashed with coldness. He felt a burning sensation in his丹田 (cultivation core), as if a heavenly fire was constantly scorching his purple sacred power.

"Eastern Purple Qi!" Diao Yuanshan pushed Yan Jun aside. He knew even though the Bee King's strength had declined, it was still beyond what this young man could withstand.

At that moment, Luotian's eyes regained their clarity. Seeing Diao Yuanshan's pale face and the corroded earth beneath him, he immediately understood. His body flashed forward, sending Yan Jun back to the stunned Xu Liyi.

Xu Liyi couldn't believe it. Just moments ago, Diao Yuanshan had completely dominated the Bee King, but now he was severely wounded.

Luotian's body flashed like lightning and appeared before Diao Yuanshan, his eyes filled with concern.

"Kid, take them two and leave. I'll deal with him and find you afterward!" Diao Yuanshan, seeing Luotian at his side, frowned slightly before speaking.

"Let me handle it. This Bee King is just a last-ditch effort. Its strength is still declining, now only slightly stronger than a Sage at the peak of their era. I should be able to handle it!" Luotian spoke with determination, knowing Diao Yuanshan couldn't fight. If he did, his sacred power would spread the poison throughout his body, leading to certain death.

Seeing Luotian's determination, Diao Yuanshan furrowed his brows further before nodding slightly.

"Emerald Crystal Glazed Fire!" Luotian pointed his hand, and waves of fire surged into Diao Yuanshan's body. The fire rose in his cultivation core, improving Diao Yuanshan's complexion.

At the same time, green fire enveloped Luotian. Knowing from the hive situation that this heavenly fire strongly suppressed Blood Demon Glazed Bees, he used it.

"Think you can block me with this fire?" The Bee King's face twisted in hatred. He knew he was doomed, but he aimed to use his last strength to kill Luotian and Diao Yuanshan. That would satisfy his hatred; otherwise, he'd die in vain.

Diao Yuanshan had already been poisoned by the Bee King's tail stinger. He was doomed, just a matter of time. Now only Luotian and Xu Liyi and Yan Jun remained. The Bee King hadn't expected Luotian to walk into his trap.

"Ten Thousand Swords Piercing the Heart!" The Bee King roared, his blood-red sword erupting again. However, its power was now ten thousand times weaker.

"Epoch Bell!" Luotian moved his hands, summoning a radiant light. The Epoch Bell materialized and enveloped him.

"Heaven-Striking Bow!" At this moment, Luotian held nothing back. He summoned the Heaven-Striking Bow and shot three arrows without giving the Bee King a chance to dodge. He also wrapped the Emerald Crystal Glazed Fire around his arrows, adding it to every technique he used.

Five times the attack power. Luotian was confident that even a Sage at the peak of their era would be hard-pressed to dodge two arrows, but one would still hit.

"How strong is this kid!" The Bee King's mind reeled. If it were normal, he could easily handle Luotian's three arrows. Even with the Emerald Crystal Glazed Fire wrapped around them, it wouldn't harm him.

But now, the Bee King's state was deteriorating. His strength had dropped from Half-Step of the Epoch to Sage at the peak, and it continued to decline.

Facing Luotian's full-force three arrows, the Bee King could only choose to dodge. His wings flapped violently, his body flashing.

But in the next moment, three magic arrows appeared before the Bee King, blocking all his escape routes.

"Pu... pu..." Though the Bee King was fast, he could only dodge one arrow. The other two pierced his body.

However, the Bee King was no ordinary foe. Once a Sage at the peak of their era, he had nearly transformed into an Epoch master. His body was incredibly strong.

The magic arrows only penetrated halfway before stopping, leaving cracks on the Bee King's body.

"Zhi..." White smoke rose from the Bee King's body as the emerald green fire seeped into it.

"Ahh..." The Bee King screamed in agony, his eyes filled with hatred as he looked at Luotian. At the same time, he flashed before Luotian's eyes, his blood-red fist—though small—carrying an immense aura. It struck the Epoch Bell protecting Luotian.

Meanwhile, ten thousand eight hundred blood-red swords also flew toward the Epoch Bell's surface, rushing toward Luotian.

"What strength do you still have now?" Luotian's eyes flashed with coldness as he faced the Bee King's full-force punch, his eyes filled with fierce battle spirit.

"Dao-Subduing Seal! Heaven-Striking Attack!" Luotian stood outside the Epoch Bell, his fists filled with Dao power.

Luotian had already grasped two thousand Dao paths. Through observing Diao Yuanshan and the Bee King's battle, he had entered another awakening state. Though brief, it allowed him to grasp five hundred more Dao paths.

Two thousand five hundred Dao paths—only five hundred remained before three thousand. This elevated the power of Luotian's Dao-Subduing Fist.

"Boom..." Luotian and the Bee King collided through the Epoch Bell. The blood-red swords continuously pierced the bell's surface, producing deafening roars that echoed in Diao Yuanshan and the others' ears. From afar, it looked as if they were clashing amidst a storm of blood-red swords.

"This kid has grasped another five hundred Dao paths in such a short time. That's the terror of the Reincarnation Body!" Diao Yuanshan's aged eyes bore shock.

Three thousand Dao paths—Diao Yuanshan, after living so long and reaching Half-Step of the Epoch, had only just mastered them. Luotian was so young and had already grasped two thousand five hundred. How could Diao Yuanshan not be astonished?

"If this kid truly masters three thousand Dao paths, it would be truly terrifying! At the peak of Sagehood, he could already harm a Sage at the peak of their era!" Diao Yuanshan spoke softly, his voice filled with admiration.

"Wow..." Xu Liyi and Yan Jun's eyes bore a flicker of shock. To harm a Sage at the peak with only Sage-level strength—this was unheard of.

"Our ancestors' Epoch Lord once grasped the ultimate power of force. He fought against a Sage at the peak of their era!" Yan Jun recalled a legend about his ancestors' Epoch Lord.

"Epoch Lord! Correct. If this kid doesn't die early, he will surely become an Epoch Lord! No one else can compete with him besides the Nine Body Types!" Diao Yuanshan spoke, his gaze on Luotian.

As they spoke, Luotian and the Bee King's figures also retreated. Luotian took a few steps back, colliding with the Epoch Bell's surface. His previous injuries reopened slightly, and blood trickled from his tears.

On the other hand, the Bee King's situation was similar. His small body looked as if it could explode at any moment, his two bee eyes filled with endless shock.

"Haha!" Luotian laughed loudly. Though wounded, his mood was surprisingly good because he could sense the Bee King's state had declined further.

"Both of you take Master Diao and leave. I'll deal with this bee and find you!" Luotian spoke to Xu Liyi and Yan Jun.

"No need. He's about to be done!" Diao Yuanshan spoke, his voice weak but clear. Though poisoned, he still had his eyesight. He could feel that if Luotian landed two more punches, the Bee King would be completely destroyed.

"Your poison!" Luotian's brow furrowed slightly, concern in his eyes for Diao Yuanshan's body.

"Haha, kid, don't think about it. That old man is definitely dead. My poison can't even be cured by myself, so no one else can!" The Bee King's face bore a flicker of arrogance as he rushed toward Luotian again. However, his aura had weakened significantly, nearing Sage at the peak of their era.

"End it quickly!" Luotian's eyes flashed with coldness. Diao Yuanshan's poison couldn't be delayed. Thinking this, Luotian immediately retracted the Epoch Bell and flashed toward the Bee King.

"One punch... two punches..." Luotian's black fists swung repeatedly, and in an instant, his fist shadows surrounded the Bee King who had rushed close.

The Bee King used all eight limbs to fight, but it was futile. Though he blocked some punches, he was constantly battered by Luotian's fists.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The collision sounds echoed continuously. In an instant, the mighty Blood Demon Glazed Bee King was shattered into fragments by Luotian's fists filled with Dao power. The emerald green fire and the Dao power instantly reduced the Bee King's shattered body to nothing.

Luotian exhaled deeply, his body constantly bleeding. But he merely wiped it with a hand and approached Diao Yuanshan, whose face had grown even more grim.

"Senior, are you alright?" Luotian's face bore worry. He truly wished Gu Lei was here; he knew nothing about poisons.

"暂无大碍 (No major issues for now). The heavenly fire is suppressing it, so the poison hasn't spread yet. But we need to resolve it quickly!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes carried concern.

"Let's return to the Star Dragon Ant Clan. We have some methods to cure the Blood Demon Glazed Bee's poison, but this Bee King's toxin is too strong. I'm not sure, but we can ask our Queen Ant. Perhaps she has a solution!" Yan Jun spoke, and Luotian's eyes brightened.

"Good. Let's leave now!" Luotian grabbed the Bee King's body, turning it into a wisp of smoke that vanished from their sight.

Luotian looked up at the two Inexorable Life-and-Death Bamboos standing there, his excitement hard to contain. "After so much sacrifice, I've finally obtained you!"

Luotian shook his head gently, looking at Diao Yuanshan with regret. He had helped too much, and this time he had suffered such a heavy cost. If things went wrong, even his life might be lost.

"Enough talk. Let's cut down one and leave the other. Maybe in the future, we can convert the entire bamboo forest into Inexorable Life-and-Death Bamboos. But by then, we might all be dead!" Diao Yuanshan interrupted Luotian's gratitude.

"Right." Luotian nodded slightly and approached the Inexorable Life-and-Death Bamboo, his palm slicing through it like a blade.

"Crack..." The towering bamboo trunk fell with a thunderous crash toward the ground.

As the massive trunk descended, it emitted a resonant hum. Green light surrounded it, and in awe of the four people, it gradually shrank until it became a three-foot-long bamboo stick, as thick as a child's arm.

Though reduced in size, its vitality seemed even more vigorous, all condensed into this small segment of bamboo.

Luotian didn't have time to think. He quickly sealed the Inexorable Life-and-Death Bamboo and supported Diao Yuanshan, walking with Xu Liyi and Yan Jun toward the Star Dragon Ant Clan.

Their speed was fast. Due to urgency, they returned to the Star Dragon Ant Clan's territory in a single day.

However, after the journey's turbulence, Diao Yuanshan's face looked even worse. Though his spirit was strong, Luotian could sense he was growing weaker. His heart felt even more guilty.

"Yan Jun has returned! Hello, two elders!" As they entered the clan, many Star Dragon Ants greeted them. Some were curious about the three supporting Diao Yuanshan.

"I need to see the Queen Ant. I'll talk to you later!" Yan Jun spoke, greeting the Star Dragon Ants before walking into the clan's depths.

At a cave entrance, Yan Jun stopped and called out: "Comrade Yan Jun wishes to see the Queen Ant. Please allow her to save our Star Dragon Ant friend!"

Yan Jun's loud voice echoed in the cave for a while before waiting for a response.

"Enter! My child!" A elderly woman's voice echoed, gentle and calming. It eased the anxiousness of Luotian and the others.

"This Queen Ant is no ordinary person!" Diao Yuanshan's face bore admiration. He had heard of the Star Dragon Ant Clan's origins on the way and was deeply moved.

"Go ahead. Don't worry. Our Queen is very kind, the wisest and strongest among us! She'll definitely find a solution!" Yan Jun spoke to Luotian, then stepped into the cave.

Luotian and the others followed Yan Jun, curious about what the Star Dragon Ant Queen looked like. Xu Liyi had been in the Star Dragon Ant Clan for a long time but hadn't seen this revered Queen.

The cave was ordinary and slightly damp, yet not too deep. After less than an hour, they reached its depths and saw the Star Dragon Ant Queen.

In front of a altar stood an elderly woman, seated in meditation. Her body was withered, covered in wrinkles, and her forehead bore strange seals. A solemn aura filled the cave.

The woman's eyes were closed, but she sensed Luotian and the others' arrival. She slowly opened her eyes, scanning them.

As the woman scanned Luotian and the others, they also observed her. When their eyes met, their minds were slightly shaken.

"Wisdom!" The word "wisdom" arose in Luotian and the others' minds. Their eyes carried respect, even Diao Yuanshan naturally felt reverence.

"Respected guests, welcome to our Star Dragon Ant Clan!" The woman's voice echoed in the cave, bringing Luotian and the others back to their senses.

"Latecomer Luotian. I hope the Queen Ant can heal my elder!" Luotian bowed respectfully, facing the Star Dragon Ant's wise one and highest-ranking Queen. His face bore respect.

"The Blood Demon Glazed Bees have finally fallen! It seems our ancestors' prophecy has come true!" The woman looked at Diao Yuanshan, her aged eyes filled with emotion.

"What?" Her words caused a wave of shock in Luotian and the others. They hadn't expected the Star Dragon Ants' ancestors to have predicted the Blood Demon Glazed Bees' downfall.

"The Blood Demon Glazed Bee's poison is an unparalleled toxin, the culmination of their entire life. Our Star Dragon Ants have methods to cure it, but only for ordinary Blood Demon Glazed Bees. For this Bee King's poison, there's no substantial solution—only temporary suppression!" The Queen Ant ignored their shock and spoke gently.

Luotian and the others fell silent, not speaking but looking at the Queen with hope. They knew she had more to say.

Seeing their eyes, the Queen's aged face bore a faint smile. She extended her hand, and black sacred power flew from her withered hands, forming into lines of black seals. The power surrounded Diao Yuanshan before entering his body.

As the black seals merged, a thunderous sound echoed from Diao Yuanshan's cultivation core. At the same time, red lines appeared on his body.

"These red lines are the toxins hidden within your body. Removing them is difficult. I'll give you a place to try!" The Queen spoke softly, her voice carrying reverence before handing Luotian and the others a map.

Luotian quickly opened the map, his face slightly grim. This map was of the entire Fallen Dragon Valley, marked with many points.

The map's preciousness alone would make many external forces covet it. After all, such a complete Fallen Dragon Valley map was rare in the world—perhaps only this one existed.

"Feathered Immortal Pool!" The Queen spoke softly, her voice carrying a hint of无奈 (helplessness). "This is where our ancestor, the Epoch Lord, created a place to refine our clan's bloodline power. Many Star Dragon Ant ancestors achieved the ultimate force in this pool, crossing into the Epoch realm! Perhaps there's a way to remove the toxins from his body within it!"

"Feathered Immortal Pool!" Hearing the Queen's words, Yan Jun's face slightly changed before a flicker of longing appeared.

In the Star Dragon Ants' prime, all clan members had the chance to enter the Feathered Immortal Pool for refinement. However, with time passing and their clan's decline, the deepest part of the Fallen Dragon Valley had become unsuitable for them. They were forced to retreat from the valley's depths to this bamboo forest.

Luotian and the others furrowed their brows, examining the map's markings. Many areas looked extremely dangerous. After searching, they finally found the location of the Feathered Immortal Pool.
