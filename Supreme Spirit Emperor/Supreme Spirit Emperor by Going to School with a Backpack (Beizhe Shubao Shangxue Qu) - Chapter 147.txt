“There’s going to be a show!” The people around wore faint smiles as they watched the old man appear in their line of sight.

“Master!”

“Master is that child and that mad old man!” Several youths in the Body Tempering Stage, their faces alight with excitement, addressed the old man.

They knew that when their master appeared, everything would be resolved. The Shuiyou Array was located beside the Northern Sea, and there were always cultivators appearing there. Most of them were lone warriors, their ranks mixed with all sorts of people. There had been strong figures from the Bone-Consuming Stage and even the Soul-Spirit Stage who came to cause trouble at the clinic, but none of them had ended well. The youths in the Body Tempering Stage knew that those troublemakers had all been thrown into the Northern Sea by their master to feed the fish.

The old man’s face bore an expression of confusion as he gazed at Dong Yichen, his eyes flashing with sharp intensity.

But when the old man shifted his gaze to the mad old man beside him, his expression subtly changed. A look of irritation crossed his face: “Why is it always you? I moved from the Eastern Domain to the Northern Domain, yet I still can’t escape you!”

Yet in the next moment, as he looked at the mad old man who clearly wasn’t himself, the old man’s face showed bewilderment. His eyes flashed like lightning, as if piercing through all things, scrutinizing the mad old man’s body.

Dong Yichen saw the old man’s gaze and shrank behind the mad old man, fear etched on his face.

The mad old man seemed to sense the old man’s gaze, his clouded eyes flickering with confusion. His aged body tensed reflexively.

“Hah, hah, interesting, truly interesting. Lost his soul—how amusing!” The old man’s face curled into a faint smile as he stroked his beard.

“Come on, little one, take good care of this boy. It might be a blessing for you!” The clinic’s master spoke to Dong Yichen, his face carrying a faint smile.

Hearing the old man’s words, the youths in the Body Tempering Stage wore expressions of disbelief as they stared at the mad old man standing there, tense and anxious.

“Does our master know this mad old man?” the youths mused silently.

The people around also sighed, their gazes filled with a touch of admiration.

“Here are some energy stones—take them and take good care of this boy!” The old man ignored the people’s astonishment, handing a few energy stones into Dong Yichen’s hands before striding into the clinic.

Dong Yichen stood frozen, stunned by the events of the day, which were far more convoluted than anything he had experienced in years.

“Senior, do you also free me?” Dong Sanzhuang’s voice rang out, his face twisted into a servile smile.

“You? Hah! If I had to clean the toilets in my clinic for twenty years, this would be settled. Don’t even think about running away; if you do, I’ll flay your skin and pull out your sinews, then throw you into the Northern Sea to feed the fish!” The old man’s face bore impatience as he punched, shattering the clinic into dust.

“Xiaoliu, find people to rebuild it! Also, go every day to my place and bring the elixirs for that man!” The old man ignored the stunned reactions, addressing the youths in the Body Tempering Stage.

“Done…” Dong Sanzhuang trembled, watching the clinic collapse, his face etched with despair.

Chapter 722: Who Am I? ()

Chapter 722: Who Am I?

After a moment of stunned silence, Dong Yichen bowed respectfully to the clinic’s master and spoke softly: “Thank you, senior. I will repay this kindness!”

The old man said nothing, giving a barely perceptible nod before vanishing from sight.

“Come on, mad old man!” Dong Yichen’s face broke into a smile; for the first time in years, he felt this happy.

With the energy stones, Dong Yichen decided to splurge, buying extensively in Shuiyou Town. A single energy stone could earn him a year’s worth of fishing.

“Mad old man, what’s your name? I can’t keep calling you mad old man forever!” Dong Yichen smiled as he addressed the old man, who was laden with items.

But the mad old man only responded with his habitual foolish grin, leaving Dong Yichen speechless.

“Mad old man, are you really strong? Will you take me as your disciple? … Mad old man, how old are you? Do you have no family?” Dong Yichen walked ahead cheerfully, like a curious child, constantly asking questions.

“Hum…” As the two walked through Shuiyou Town’s market, a tremor rose in the sky, causing people to look on in alarm.

“Immortal!” The entire Shuiyou Town’s sky saw a woman appear, her white robes as pure as snow, her face breathtakingly beautiful. Her long gown fluttered without wind, and a faint sorrow lingered on her face.

She extended her hand, slowly unfurling something like a scroll. A tremor rippled through her hands.

As the scroll unfurled, an image of a man appeared in people’s sight—clearly drawn, a young man holding a spear.

“Everyone, I am Gu Qianxue, a disciple of the Northern Domain’s Five Elements Sect. The man in this image is our sect’s genius disciple, Luo Tian. If anyone discovers his whereabouts or any useful clues, please contact us. Our Five Elements Sect will surely offer a generous reward!” The woman’s voice echoed across Shuiyou Town, reaching everyone’s heart.

“Wow, such a beautiful sister!” Dong Yichen marveled at Gu Qianxue in the sky.

“Luo Tian… Luo Tian…” The mad old man behind Dong Yichen wore a bewildered expression, gazing at Gu Qianxue and the massive silhouette in the sky, muttering softly.

“The Five Elements Sect is the dominant force across the Northern Domain. Luo Tian is also a renowned genius in the Northern Domain. I never expected him to vanish. If I find him, hah! The reward from the Five Elements Sect would definitely be enough to elevate me to the Soul-Spirit Stage!”

“Yes, I heard that the Five Elements Sect is currently at its peak. Even other sects from different domains show it great respect. Recently, strong cultivators from various domains gathered at the Five Elements Sect! The Southern Domain’s Qionghua Palace was supposedly destroyed by Luo Tian!” Several lone warriors in the Body Tempering Stage Nine Heavy had expressions of admiration as they murmured.

“Please, everyone! If you have any clues, touching the image in the sky will let me know. I promise that if there’s even a hint, I’ll make you an official disciple of the Five Elements Sect!” Gu Qianxue’s voice faded, and her white figure vanished from sight.

“Official disciple of the Five Elements Sect!” Gu Qianxue’s disappearance caused a stir in Shuiyou Town.

“An official disciple of the Five Elements Sect!” Dong Yichen wore a face of envy as he spoke to the mad old man beside him.

“I think I’m called Luo Tian!” But what he received was the mad old man’s low mutter.

“What?” Dong Yichen wore a look of disbelief, scrutinizing the mad old man closely with an astonished expression.

“Hmph! A madman, don’t even look at your own worth or age—how dare you impersonate a genius of the Five Elements Sect!” A lone warrior in the Body Tempering Stage Four Heavy passed by Dong Yichen and the mad old man, his face filled with disdain.

Dong Yichen scrutinized the mad old man carefully before glancing at the young face in the sky, then shook his head and ignored the passerby’s mockery. He took the mad old man by the arm and headed toward the fishing village.

Dong Yichen knew that this Five Elements Sect had nothing to do with him. He was just an ordinary boy who never dreamed of joining such a divine sect.

He led the mad old man back to the fishing village, gave his sister the herbs, and cooked a feast. The three of them ate heartily before falling into deep sleep.

From the next day on, Dong Yichen continued his usual routine of rowing his boat to fish in the Northern Sea. The only difference was that now, a foolish old man followed him.

The villagers of the fishing village knew Dong Yichen had rescued a mad old man and advised him to abandon the old man, as their lives weren’t exactly affluent. But Dong Yichen simply smiled and ignored them, continuing his routine as before.

Every night, disciples from the clinic in the Body Tempering Stage brought a large amount of herbs to Dong Yichen’s home, respectfully handing over the medicine to the mad old man. The mad old man continued eating heartily without a care.

Time passed slowly, and Dong Yichen, his sister Dong Yan’er, and the mad old man lived peacefully in the fishing village.

A month passed, but that day, dark clouds gathered over the fishing village, swirling above the small village.

The blood-red moon, usually ignored by people, was nearly full—its light turned the entire sky an eerie red.

“Brother, I’m scared!” Dong Yan’er’s face was filled with fear, her small body trembling.

Dong Yichen also felt a tremor in his spirit, gazing at the sky with a sense of suffocation. To comfort his sister, he forced himself to stay calm: “Don’t be afraid; I’m here!”

A black figure appeared above the fishing village, its face cold and expressionless. The blood-red moon on its black robe was strikingly obvious.

“Fifteen days, and then I won’t have to be so sneaky!” The black figure murmured lowly, its hands moving swiftly. Blood-red energy burst forth from its palms, forming a sea of blood that enveloped the entire fishing village.

People still fishing at night looked up in fear, watching the rolling sea of blood.

“Pang…” A fisherman’s body exploded into a mist of blood, rising and merging into the sea of blood.

“Ah… I’m going to explode! Mad old man, save my sister!” Dong Yichen felt unbearable discomfort, as if his body was about to rupture. His sister fared even worse; fine cracks appeared on her pale skin, and thin lines of blood oozed from them.

“Tian Shi Zong…” The mad old man’s voice was deep and aged, his gaze still bewildered but now with a glimmer of vitality.

Chapter 723: Buying the Boat ()

Chapter 723: Buying the Boat

“Tian Shi Zong?” Dong Yichen’s face wore confusion as he heard the mad old man’s words. As an ordinary person, he had no idea what Tian Shi Zong was.

But in the next moment, the mad old man’s figure vanished into the house, leaving Dong Yichen stunned.

The aged figure appeared in the sky, gazing at the black-cloaked man standing proudly above him. The man’s aura was cold and menacing.

“Although I still don’t know who I am, I do know that I want to kill you—and very much!” The mad old man’s face was expressionless, his eyes vacant as he stared at the black-cloaked man.

“Who are you?” The black-cloaked man’s face showed concern upon seeing someone appear before him instantly.

The black-cloaked man was a Soul-Spirit Stage cultivator, but within Tian Shi Zong he was merely a low-ranking soldier responsible for collecting blood energy for returning high-level cultivators.

He had been cautious, targeting only small villages and avoiding major cities.

Now, a old man appeared before him, staring directly at him with the intent to kill. No one could silently appear before him like that.

But in the next moment, the man noticed that this old man had no energy at all, and his face relaxed.

“No energy? Dare you kill me? Become nourishment for my soul pearl!” The man’s face was cold as he extended his hand.

The sea of blood roared to life, forming a blood-red dragon that lunged at the mad old man.

The mad old man remained calm, instinctively throwing his full strength into a punch toward the blood-red dragon.

“Die!” The man’s face curled into a sneer, waiting for the blood-red dragon to devour the old man.

“Pang…” In an instant, the man was stunned, his entire body frozen as he stared ahead.

The mad old man’s punch shattered the blood-red dragon, which dissolved into a storm of blood.

“Flee!” The man, naturally timid, realized he was no match for this eccentric old man. His blood-red wings flapped, and he flew away.

“Crack…” But a aged face appeared before him again, and the old man delivered another punch to his chest.

The man’s eyes were filled with endless fear as he soared through the sky, landing in a deep pit.

“Pang…” Before the man could cry out, the old man appeared like a ghost before him again and delivered another punch to his head.

“Pang…” The man’s head exploded into a mist of blood, staining the ground red. He died in the deep pit.

The mad old man seemed unaffected, slowly walking back toward Dong’s courtyard. The blood energy in the sky dispersed with the man’s death.

“Huff…” Dong Yichen exhaled deeply, feeling the intense pressure dissipate. His face wore relief.

Dong Yichen took out some herbs, applying them to his sister’s body with a worried expression. He watched the door anxiously, worrying about the mad old man’s departure.

An hour passed as Dong Yichen waited, growing more anxious with each moment. He thought of the mad old man’s arrival and how it had changed his life and that of his sister. The mad old man, with his foolish grins and occasional mistakes, had brought them joy. Dong Yichen had already regarded the mad old man as family.

The thought of a madman wandering outside and suffering made him restless. After putting his sister to sleep, he decided to go find the mad old man.

As Dong Yichen just stood up, a hunched figure appeared before him, startling him. He looked under the light and saw it was the mad old man. Dong Yichen sighed in relief, mentally reassuring himself that the mad old man was a master and this situation was common.

“Blood! Mad old man, are you injured?” The next moment, Dong Yichen’s face turned pale as he saw the mad old man sitting there covered in blood. His eyes flickered slightly, and he remained silent, even his usual foolish grin absent. This made Dong Yichen extremely anxious.

But the mad old man said nothing, his eyes filled with a deep sense of sorrow as he gazed northward.

Seeing the mad old man’s silence, Dong Yichen also fell silent. He felt that something was different about the mad old man today.

For the next few days, Dong Yichen continued rowing his boat to fish while the mad old man followed him. He no longer smiled, and his eyes grew brighter but still carried a deep sorrow.

During these days, Dong Yichen noticed the mad old man becoming increasingly silent. Sometimes he didn’t speak at all for an entire day, just standing motionless on the boat with vacant eyes.

“Little friend, can you sell us your boat?” On this day, as Dong Yichen and the mad old man went fishing, he heard a pleasant voice.

Dong Yichen wore an expression of confusion as he looked up at the sky, then his spirit trembled.

Above the sky stood two women. One was Gu Qianxue, the genius of the Five Elements Sect he had seen in Shuiyou Town. The other was a more beautiful woman, whose beauty made Dong Yichen think Gu Qianxue was the most beautiful he had ever seen. But this woman was perfect.

Dong Yichen’s face turned red; though only eleven, he was already a boy and had never spoken to a girl before. He stood there stunned.

What Dong Yichen and Gu Qianxue didn’t notice was that when the two women appeared in the sky, the mad old man lowered his hat so low it almost obscured his face.

“Little friend, this energy stone is enough to cover your small boat. Do you think it’s acceptable?” Gu Qianxue smiled as she addressed Dong Yichen, whose face was red.

“Selling it to you is fine, but you must tell us what you need the boat for!” A deep voice echoed from beneath the old hat, drawing the three of them to look at the mad old man.

Dong Yichen wore an odd expression as he looked at the mad old man. These days, the mad old man had spoken only three sentences. Now, seeing two beautiful women, he spoke up.

“Old man, you’re not acting your age!” Dong Yichen muttered in his heart but wore a curious expression. He looked at the two women, wondering why these flying and divine figures would want to buy a small broken boat.

Chapter 724: Awakening ()

Chapter 724: Awakening

For the past twenty days, Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan had been desperate for any news of Luo Tian. After twenty days of gathering information, someone saw a streak of light leave the Five Elements Sect and enter the Northern Sea. After twenty days without clues, they decided to cross the Northern Sea in search of Luo Tian.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan descended from the sky, their faces solemn as they gazed at the old man before them. They exchanged a glance and both felt an unspoken thought: “This old man is no ordinary person!”

Although the mad old man had lowered his hat so low it obscured his face, Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan were both cultivators who had grasped a fragment of the Chaos Power. A regular hat could not block their spiritual senses, but this old man gave them a vague feeling, making it impossible to see his true face. This left them in awe.

“Senior, we wish to cross the Northern Sea. To be safe, we’ve prepared a small boat,” Gu Qianxue spoke, her face carrying a respectful expression.

Dong Yichen was stunned by Gu Qianxue’s words. He naturally knew who they were, but these two women addressed the mad old man as “Senior,” which made Dong Yichen unable to believe what he saw.

Hearing Gu Qianxue’s words, the mad old man with his hat lowered slightly trembled. His voice was still aged: “Not selling it. I advise the two of you not to cross the Northern Sea. The Northern Sea is extremely dangerous; even if both of you have grasped a fragment of the Chaos Power and are at the Soul-Spirit Stage, it’s still full of peril!”

“I know you’re searching for someone. Believe me, return home. In a few days, the one you seek will definitely come back!” The mad old man spoke, his voice carrying a sense of helplessness.

Hearing the mad old man’s words, Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan were stunned. Their faces bore endless joy as they gazed at the mad old man.

“Senior, you… know where Luo Tian is? Please tell me; even if I can only see him once, it would be enough to confirm he’s safe!” Leng Qiuchan spoke with excitement, her usually proud and aloof demeanor absent. She bowed respectfully to the mad old man.

“He, was injured and is currently in seclusion for recovery. No one must disturb him. I can only tell you this much; when he recovers, he will return on his own. You need not worry! Also, they asked me to give this to you!” The mad old man’s withered hand extended and cast a green light.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan heard that Luo Tian was injured, their faces showing concern. But upon hearing he was recovering, they relaxed. In their minds, as long as Luo Tian didn’t die, it was fine. They had already believed the mad old man’s words to five degrees.

The green light flashed, and Gu Qianxue caught it in her hands. She gasped softly: “This is Luo Tian’s storage ring!”

Leng Qiuchan was also excited, her face filled with excitement as she took the green ring and gently caressed it.

Seeing Luo Tian’s storage ring, they believed the mad old man’s words to eight degrees. Their faces bore gratitude as they bowed respectfully to him.

“Thank you, senior, for your rescue!” They had no doubts about the mad old man’s intentions. In their minds, this old man’s cultivation was already beyond the ordinary; a realm master. If he had ill intentions toward Luo Tian, there would be no need to go through such trouble or waste so much time.

“Go on, return home. Tian Shi Zong… the great battle—perhaps he won’t make it. But I might go there. As for the resources in this ring, you two can handle them as you wish!” The old man’s voice echoed, waving his hand at Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

“Yes!” Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan, sensing the old man’s impatience, dared not disturb him. Their hearts felt a weight lifted as they wore respectful expressions. After all, they had learned of Luo Tian’s whereabouts and needed to return quickly. The time for the full moon battle was only seven days away, and they had to hurry back.

“Sorry!” A low voice echoed from beneath the hat, two tears falling onto the ground.

“Mad old man… are you okay?” Dong Yichen saw the mad old man’s state was clearly off, his face filled with concern but he dared not approach. Now, Dong Yichen had fully realized the mad old man must be a great person.

“Boy, you did well; your recovery was much faster than expected. Did you really give up? I think if you had revealed your identity, those two girls wouldn’t have left!” The old man’s voice echoed as a senior appeared on the water, sitting beside Luo Tian. He took out a flask of wine and offered it to the mad old man.

“No need, my lifespan is short; I won’t live for many years. Thank you for the herbs!” The mad old man grabbed his hat and lifted it, a grateful expression on his aged face as he drank the wine.

“Don’t give up, young one; there’s always a way when the mountain is blocked,” the old man said with a sigh, gazing at the aged mad old man.

Dong Yichen wore a respectful expression as he watched the two old men sitting by the boat, gently rowing it across the sea.

“Old… you’ve recovered?” Dong Yichen, seeing both old men remain silent, finally dared to speak. But he thought, if the mad old man truly had recovered, he wouldn’t be called “mad old man” anymore.

Seeing Dong Yichen’s trembling demeanor, the mad old man wore a gentle expression and nodded slightly: “Yes, I’ve remembered some things. I am Luo Tian!”

Luo Tian’s voice carried endless sorrow as he spoke to Dong Yichen, his eyes once again deep and profound.

“Luo Tian… Luo Tian…” Dong Yichen whispered twice, then widened his eyes, staring at the aged old man before him. He was speechless for a moment.

“You really are Luo Tian! Then those two sisters were looking for you, right? Why did you pretend not to know them?” Although Dong Yichen was shocked, he eventually believed Luo Tian’s words.

“Some things you’ll understand when you grow up and meet someone you love,” Luo Tian’s weathered lips curled into a bitter smile, his voice hoarse.

Seeing Luo Tian’s state was off, Dong Yichen wanted to ask more but restrained himself.

“By the way, Yichen, you’ve always wanted to cultivate, right? Would you like to be my disciple?” Luo Tian looked at Dong Yichen with a smile.

“Don’t fight over the student, I’ve observed him for years. How old are you? You’re too young to take a disciple!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the old man sitting beside him was furious and shouted at Luo Tian.

Chapter 725: Life Has Ended ()

Chapter 725: Life Has Ended

In the Northern Sea fishing village, Luo Tian sat in a dilapidated house with his eyes open, a bitter expression on his face.

“After all, it still didn’t work!” Luo Tian muttered lowly, his eyes filled with intense regret.

It had been three days since Luo Tian fully regained consciousness. Now, he had completely remembered everything. His aged body’s three souls and seven essences were slightly weakened but had recovered.

“Meridians are withered, life has ended!” Luo Tian realized his physical condition upon awakening. The departure of the Epoch Book had caused him immense damage, and even as a ninth-grade alchemist, he could do nothing.

Especially the black qi left by Wangyue in his body had devoured all of his three souls and seven essences. If it weren’t for the automatic protection of the Jade Crystal Luminous Fire, he might have already died.

His spiritual sense probed his dantian and found the faint green flame of the Jade Crystal Luminous Fire. Luo Tian’s eyes showed regret: “I’m sorry, it’s because of me that you’re in this state!”

The Jade Crystal Luminous Fire had protected Luo Tian’s soul but was also severely wounded. Combined with the fact that it had already recognized Luo Tian as its master and was closely tied to him, if the fire died, he would die; if he didn’t die, the fire wouldn’t end. At this moment, the Jade Crystal Luminous Fire was at its weakest.

“Hot…!” Two childish voices echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, interrupting his thoughts. His aged gaze turned gentle.

He gently stepped off the bamboo bed and opened the door, seeing two large jars in the courtyard. He walked over to them.

“Can’t even endure this hardship? You want to cultivate, but after that, don’t say I’m your master! You’ll be a disgrace!” The clinic’s old man wore an严厉 expression as he scolded the two jars, who were screaming constantly.

Dong Yichen heard the old man’s words and wore a determined expression, his fists clenched tightly as he stared at the water in the jars.

Dong Yan’er, on the other hand, wore a委屈 expression. She was only five or six years old but still didn’t understand why she had been forcibly taken as a disciple by this old man. She also couldn’t comprehend why the mad old man, who had always smiled and cared for her, now ignored her suffering.

“Waa…” Thinking of this, Dong Yan’er burst into tears, looking at Luo Tian with a pleading expression.

“I don’t want to cultivate… I don’t want to cultivate!” Dong Yan’er’s face turned red as she shouted at Luo Tian.

Seeing the adorable look of Dong Yan’er, Luo Tian couldn’t help but laugh softly. He sighed inwardly; having two realm masters as teachers, yet someone still didn’t want to learn. If it were known, people would surely be amazed at this girl’s audacity.

“Hmph! I’ve had disciples from the Northern Domain to the Eastern Domain, and you little girl don’t want it. That really makes me angry!” Xiang Tianming was clearly very upset, increasing the fire’s intensity.

“Gurgle…” White steam rose around Dong Yan’er, making her scream louder.

“Pang…” Under Dong Yan’er’s loud screaming, the two jars of water shattered, scattering into countless fragments.

“Huff…” Dong Yichen exhaled deeply, his face showing a sense of relief but also joy. He felt his strength had increased.

“Good, in three days you’ve reached the Body Tempering Stage One! You have some talent!” Xiang Tianming’s face showed a slight satisfaction.

Luo Tian also nodded in approval, gazing at the brother and sister, Dong Yichen and Dong Yan’er. In three days, they had reached the Body Tempering Stage One—people would doubt it if told. But with Xiang Tianming, a realm master, and Luo Tian, the only ninth-grade alchemist in the entire Tianyuan Continent, nothing was impossible.

If Luo Tian wanted to, he could instantly turn them into bones, but for their stable cultivation, he decided not to let them take pills immediately. If they obtained it too easily, they would become dependent on the pills, which would be counterproductive.

Especially for Dong Yan’er, whose character was still unstable; if he handed over a proud disciple, it would be ruined.

“Alright, go with your Luo master to cultivate. Tomorrow I’ll come again; tomorrow will be even more difficult. Prepare yourself!” Xiang Tianming smiled, addressing Dong Yan’er with a strict expression.

“Hmph! Ugly master, ugly old man… when I become strong, I’ll pluck out your beard!” Dong Yan’er’s face wore a resentful expression as she muttered, making Luo Tian laugh softly.

Under Dong Yan’er’s constant muttering and Dong Yichen’s trembling grin, Xiang Tianming slowly stepped out of the door.

“Alright, rest for a while; later you’ll practice the techniques I gave you!” Luo Tian sighed and addressed the siblings.

“Haha, master, can we rest a little longer?” Dong Yan’er’s legs lightly kicked as she appeared before Luo Tian, gently tugging at his pants.

“Only you know how to be lazy; learn from your brother!” Luo Tian gently pinched Dong Yan’er’s nose, his face showing a touch of indulgence. He looked at Dong Yichen, who had already sat in meditation.

The spiritual energy of the world continuously gathered toward Dong Yichen, who greedily absorbed it, his face filled with a trance-like expression.

Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming had clear divisions of labor: one was to lay a solid foundation for the siblings, and the other taught them techniques.

Laying the foundation was naturally Xiang Tianming’s task, as he had lived for countless years. As for techniques, Luo Tian, being a sect leader of three sects, had no shortage of them.

Although Luo Tian wanted to pass on the Five Elements Transformation Technique to them, he knew it was only for those with a Five Elements Body. So he had no choice but to give up.

The siblings’ talent was ordinary, both with a single element. Perhaps it was because of their location by the Northern Sea; they were both Water Element bodies.

Luo Tian had Xiang Tianming extract the Wind and Thunder Heart from his body, dividing it into two parts and injecting them into the siblings’ bodies. Once they reached the Bone-Consuming Stage, it would appear naturally for them to cultivate.

The siblings sat on the ground, spiritual energy from the world pouring into their bodies, restoring the energy they had lost. They then slowly stood up.

Luo Tian picked up three sticks and carved them into the shape of a spear, handing it to the two siblings.

“You are my only two disciples in this life. Therefore, I will teach you everything I have. Today’s lesson is the spear technique I received from a long-lost elder—the Splitting Heaven Spear Technique!” Luo Tian’s face showed nostalgia as he held the wooden spear, addressing Dong Yichen and his sister.

Chapter 726: Two Days ()

Chapter 726: Two Days

In the Western Domain of the Tianyuan Continent.

At this moment, the entire Western Domain was in chaos; the land lay in ruins with bones scattered like mountains.

Although Luo Tian’s disappearance had halted battles among the sects of the Tianyuan Continent, it hadn’t stopped the skeletal army of Tian Shi Zong. After the Five Elements Sect, Yuling Sect, and Bingji Island withdrew, the skeletal army had only been calm for a day before being commanded by Yang Huanyu to attack the Tianyuan forces.

The people of the Tianyuan Continent had no choice but to fight back, and battles resumed. The Western Domain was once again engulfed in war.

After twenty days of the three sects leaving, battles had lasted twenty days. With over a million Soul-Spirit Stage and Bone-Consuming Stage cultivators, they were exhausted. Countless strong warriors died daily on the battlefield, and it was brutal.

Although many had perished, the results were somewhat significant. Especially after Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan returned with news that Luo Tian was safe, the strong warriors of the three sects joined the battle.

The Tianyuan Continent had paid a heavy price of eight hundred thousand lives to completely eliminate the skeletal army. The battle, which had lasted over twenty days, was declared temporarily concluded.

But the demon master Zhang Daotian and Yin Tianxiong hadn’t dared to be careless. They still kept many sects on standby, regrouping and consulting with the elders of major sects to plan strategies. They intended to strike a fatal blow at Tian Shi Zong on the day before the full moon, ending this brutal battle.

Time passed slowly; only two days remained until the full moon night. The blood-red moon, if not carefully observed, was nearly full.

“Disciples below the Soul-Spirit Stage, stand outside the Western Domain and wait for orders. Disciples of the Reincarnation Stage and Soul-Spirit Stage, follow me into the Western Domain!” With only two days left, the three realm masters finally issued a total attack command. They led the strongest warriors of the Tianyuan Continent into the Western Domain.

“Have they come? Hah, I anticipated it!” Yang Huanyu sat in his palace, gazing at the thousands of old subordinates before him. His face bore a cold smile.

“Master, the people from the Tianyuan Continent have entered! Should we go out and fight them?” A senior with black qi in his body addressed Yang Huanyu.

“Yes… these ants truly think we are easy to bully!”

“Exactly! How powerful was the Xiangu Continent? In the end, it was still blood-sacrificed by us!” Thousands of strong warriors wore boundless killing intent as they addressed Yang Huanyu.

“Go ahead, kill freely! The Epoch Book needs the blood of strong warriors to activate. Only then can we open the door to the Eternal Life Realm and live forever!” Yang Huanyu gently caressed the Epoch Book in his hands, addressing his subordinates who had been eager to fight.

Though it was only thousands of people, they were strong warriors who had followed the previous incarnation of Yang Huanyu, Wangyue. They had been with him for countless years.

At this moment, they were awakened by Yang Huanyu and had restored to their peak through years of collected blood energy and soul essence. Their cultivation even surpassed before.
