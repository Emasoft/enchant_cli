"Who says I don't dare? I've already killed the son of a heavenly king. What's three more prodigies?" Luotian said with a cold smile, his eyes always fixed on Wangxiu.

"Ah..." Wangxiu's face slightly tensed, locking eyes with Luotian. His gaze flickered before finally shaking his head gently.

"I surrender!" Wangxiu's voice carried a note of resentment. As the words fell, they caused an uproar among the crowd, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Chapter 2194: Allocation of Hell

"Did he really surrender? How could he?" People's eyes reflected disbelief as they looked at Wangxiu, who stood opposite Luotian with a bitter smile.

Wangxiu shook his head gently. It wasn't that he didn't want to fight Luotian, but he had seen the intense killing intent in Luotian's eyes. If he didn't surrender, Luotian would definitely kill the three of them.

These three were prodigies and his future support within the Shrouded Demon Sect. He couldn't allow them to die, for the loss would be great.

"Good! That's more like it!" Luotian nodded, raising his hand and sending three soul fragments to Wangxiu's side.

"Saint Son Battle: First place in the Wheel Rotation Hall, second place in the Shrouded Demon Sect!" As Luotian sent the three soul fragments to Wangxiu's side, the eight heavenly kings, including Shou Guiwang, sighed deeply and announced the results.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed in the sky of the Wheel Rotation Hall, and cheers soared to the heavens. Each disciple of the Wheel Rotation Hall was filled with excitement as they looked at Luotian standing on the battlefield.

"Haha, who says our Wheel Rotation Hall has no talent? Our saint son swept through all nine halls! And this is before the saintess even stepped onto the battlefield. If she did, she would crush them all!" Disciples of the Wheel Rotation Hall became excited and repeatedly threw Luotian into the air.

With the end of the saint son battle, the ten-hall competition was also over. As for the allocation of hell, the ten hall masters would naturally discuss it among themselves; there was no need for Luotian and others to get involved. The Wheel Rotation Hall ranked fifth, giving it some say in the selection of hell. After hosting a banquet for several halls, those halls left the Wheel Rotation Hall. However, Luochen's name spread throughout hell.

Winning first place in the saint son battle and leading three prodigies, Luochen had pushed the Wheel Rotation Hall from last place to fifth. This event was already spreading throughout hell.

"Reward for Saint Son Luochen: Ten彼岸 flowers, one upper-grade ghost weapon!"

"Reward for Wang Gang, Qiu Long, and Mo Tian: Ten彼岸 flowers!" Two days after the halls left, Hei Bai Wu Chang announced the rewards for Luochen and others.

"Additionally, a marriage match between the saint son and saintess. Choose an auspicious day for the wedding!"

"The Wheel Rotation Hall's forbidden area will be open to the saint son and saintess for one visit! I myself will personally protect them!" However, it wasn't over. Hei Bai Wu Chang's next statement caused a great uproar among the Wheel Rotation Hall disciples.

"Saintess has been seduced by the saint son. I don't want to live anymore!" The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Hall cried out.

"The Wheel Rotation Hall's forbidden area!"

"Isn't that where they practice the secret techniques of the Wheel Rotation Hall?" The disciples were even more shocked by this new information.

"We, the Wheel Rotation Hall, have always been at a disadvantage because our saint son lacks secret techniques. Other nine halls' saint sons all have secret techniques, and if our saint son learns one more technique, he could easily surpass the other halls' saint sons!"

"However, I heard that our Wheel Rotation Hall's secret techniques are difficult to learn. Even the hall master has mastered two people through hard work. Will there be any danger for the saint son?" Soon, the disciples of the Wheel Rotation Hall shifted from joy to worry.

While the Wheel Rotation Hall was celebrating, other halls quickly moved on from this big competition. However, one hall was particularly gloomy: the Yellow Heaven Hall.

Their saint son had been blinded and nearly killed, and two prodigies were sent to reincarnation. This was quite embarrassing.

The Yellow Heaven Hall also withdrew from a certain hell, which made the disciples of the Yellow Heaven Hall even more discontent.

"I could do it too. After all, five to zero..." At that moment, the disciples of the Yellow Heaven Hall directed their anger towards Yijianren and others. Although they didn't say it openly, they constantly discussed it in secret.

Yijianren returned to the Yellow Heaven Hall and became extremely low-key, avoiding going out and declaring a retreat into seclusion.

...

In the first hall of the Wheel Rotation Hall, Hei Bai Wu Chang sat at the head with eight vice-hall masters seated on both sides, their faces showing smiles.

"Luochen, from now on, our past matters are settled! How about that?" Yu Tian spoke to Luochen with sincerity in his eyes.

"Thank you, Master Yu. It's good that you don't hold a grudge!" As a vice-hall master, Yu Tian took the initiative to give them both an opportunity. Luochen wouldn't refuse.

"Haha, from now on, our Wheel Rotation Hall will become better and better!" Du Jianxing's face showed satisfaction as he looked at Luochen.

The conversation between Yu Tian and Luochen was just a small interlude. After they spoke, people turned their attention to Hei Bai Wu Chang sitting at the head.

"We want the Fire Sea Hell!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke directly, revealing the key point and causing people's faces to show joy.

"Next, it's time for the Wheel Rotation Hall disciples to move. You take care of these matters. Since the Reincarnation Hell is our base, I will stay here myself. Du Jianxing, Cheng Tiande, Yu Tian, and Qiu Zhong, four of you will take half the disciples of the Wheel Rotation Hall to Fire Sea Hell!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke again, directly addressing the allocation issue. Two仙王中期 and two仙王初期 went to Fire Sea Hell.

"Yes!" Du Jianxing and the others quickly bowed and spoke, entering Fire Sea Hell was a good assignment. Especially for Yu Tian, who was skilled in fire, his strength would grow quickly.

"Choose which disciples you want to take. The saint son will also go with you!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke again.

Everyone in the hall understood what Hei Bai Wu Chang meant. This was to have Luochen take over the Wheel Rotation Hall's affairs in advance and reside in Fire Sea Hell. Obviously, Du Jianxing and others wouldn't interfere too much; everything would need to be done by Luochen, then he would establish his authority among the Wheel Rotation Hall disciples.

"Alright, the saint son and saintess stay. You take care of it!" Hei Bai Wu Chang gave some more instructions before speaking to everyone.

Du Jianxing and others left. The hall was now only occupied by Luochen, Fu Xingxuan, and Hei Bai Wu Chang.

Hei Bai Wu Chang looked at Luochen and Fu Xingxuan: "You two will enter the forbidden area. Although there are some dangers inside, with my presence, I can ensure your safety. Don't try to force yourself into cultivation; otherwise, I am the best example!"

"Hey, Master, can't I just skip it? You said I could go to the army. Look, I even won first place in this competition..." Luochen smiled nervously as he spoke to Hei Bai Wu Chang.

"Come on... you still want to run away?"

"In the Wheel Rotation Hall, you get wind and rain. Isn't that enough? Go to hell and return to the celestial realm!" Hei Bai Wu Chang became angry, looking at Luochen.

"Don't run away! Just stay here and be good. When you enter仙王, you will become the master of our Wheel Rotation Hall!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke again and directly refused Luochen's request.

"Master, we had agreed that after the competition I could leave. You can't go back on your word!" Luochen was unwilling, but he knew that the other side could kill him instantly. He had to reason with them instead of fighting.

"No..."

"Master, you are a great being..."

"I said you can't leave. You won't!" They took turns speaking, and Hei Bai Wu Chang refused to let Luochen go. He looked like a pig that didn't fear boiling water.

"Ugh..." Finally, Luochen sighed deeply. His eyes stared intensely at Hei Bai Wu Chang and said with gritted teeth: "Okay, I won't leave. I want to see if you can watch me every day!"

"Haha, kid, do you think you can run away? You don't know my仙王 peak skills!" Hei Bai Wu Chang laughed coldly.

Luochen was completely defeated by Hei Bai Wu Chang. He couldn't fight back, and he couldn't run away. He was being a brat, but the other side seemed even more unscrupulous.

"What in the world is this for?" Luochen was confused about what this old ghost was up to. He didn't understand why he had to stay in the Wheel Rotation Hall.

"Here's an idea, kid. If you can master the secret techniques of the Wheel Rotation Hall, I'll let you leave!" Hei Bai Wu Chang grinned.

"You said that last time too..." Luochen shook his head. Although the secret techniques of the Wheel Rotation Hall were tempting, he didn't want to end up like Hei Bai Wu Chang with a split personality.

At this point, Luochen realized that although Hei Bai Wu Chang was the master, his character was very unscrupulous. That's what people called an old man with a mischievous heart.

"Can't go, if you succeed, I'll let you leave!" Hei Bai Wu Chang grinned again and waved his hand. Immediately, he transported Luochen and Fu Xingxuan out of the hall.

"Black and White Ghosts, your grandfather!" Luochen cursed loudly. However, he was immediately carried away by the transportation force and disappeared with Fu Xingxuan in the hall.

Time passed. A familiar feeling, Luochen fell directly onto the ground. As soon as he landed, his first thought wasn't about himself but looking up at the sky. A graceful figure descended from the sky.

"Boom..." Fu Xingxuan's body landed precisely on Luochen, causing him to fall again onto the ground.

"Sweetheart, are you okay? Did you get hurt?" Luochen quickly got up and helped Fu Xingxuan, his eyes filled with concern as he carefully examined her.

"Are you okay? Did I hurt you?" Fu Xingxuan was satisfied with Luochen's first thought of her and looked at him tenderly.

"Kid, don't be so sentimental. It's about to start. Are you ready?" As the two of them were concerned with each other, Hei Bai Wu Chang's voice broke the atmosphere.

"A single dog, no, a single ghost. You don't understand anything!" Luochen frowned and spoke with disdain. Then he looked around.

But the surroundings were empty, covered in runes that spread outward.

"Buzz..." Before Luochen and Fu Xingxuan could react, waves rose from under their feet. With a rumble, the ground beneath them started to shake violently.

Chapter 2195: The Destruction of the Lu Family

The runes began to twist under Luochen and Fu Xingxuan's feet, filling their minds with dizziness. The ground seemed to start spinning, but only the area under their feet remained intact.

"Sit down!" A pressure swept over them and forced them to sit on the ground. The twisting runes continuously poured into their bodies.

"External Body Manifestation!" In an instant, a flood of information rushed into Luochen and Fu Xingxuan's minds.

This forbidden area was called the Wheel Rotation Plateau, where the secret techniques of the Wheel Rotation Hall were cultivated. If mastered, it would produce an external body manifestation, as real as the true self. It could also be cultivated and fused with the true self at critical moments.

Hei Bai Wu Chang had previously made a mistake, splitting himself into two separate bodies.

"Who forces people to learn like this!" Luochen was helpless, but since Hei Bai Wu Chang had said they would be protected, there was no need for Luochen and Fu Xingxuan to worry. They let the runes flow into their bodies, beginning to cultivate this external body manifestation.

"This kid is a reincarnation of the Wheel, with a reincarnation bloodline. This external body manifestation will definitely be successful. Fu Xingxuan, being his wife, has a great connection with him and should also be successful!" Hei Bai Wu Chang sat in the hall.

Only Hei Bai Wu Chang could see their environment. They were in a large circular plate, rotating rapidly. Their position was the center of the circle.

While Luochen and Fu Xingxuan were cultivating their external body manifestation, Shou Guiwang returned to his city. Before entering the city, Shou Guiwang's eyebrows slightly furrowed.

"Roar..." A black tiger roared beneath Shou Guiwang, its massive body exuding a powerful king's aura.

Minghu, Shou Guiwang's specially raised ghost creature, was strong. It had now become a half-step仙王 and was about to break through to仙王.

This time, Shou Guiwang went to the Wheel Rotation Hall. Minghu naturally became his steed.

"What a feeling of unease?" Shou Guiwang furrowed his eyebrows slightly and gently patted the head of Minghu.

"Roar..." Minghu growled and flew towards Shou Guiwang's city.

Within a quarter of an hour, Shou Guiwang arrived at his city. As soon as he appeared, the people of Shou Guiwang's city knew about his arrival.

"Lord, it's a big problem!" A voice echoed in Shou Guiwang's mind.

"Someone took advantage of your absence to attack Shou Guiwang City and killed the Lu family!" Wanglong's voice was filled with urgency.

"What!" Upon hearing Wanglong's words, Shou Guiwang's face changed abruptly. He landed in the city hall and used his spiritual sense to cover the entire Shou Guiwang City.

At this moment, Shou Guiwang City was in ruins. The city hall's buildings were collapsing, and the people of the city hall were repairing it.

But the Lu family was completely wiped out. The air still carried a scent of blood.

"What happened?" Shou Guiwang's face was dark as he looked at Wanglong and the city hall's high-ranking officials in the meeting hall.

"Three days after you left, everyone in Shou Guiwang City was poisoned, including me. We all lost our cultivation and were killed by a group of people who covered their faces and entered the city hall to massacre the Lu family."

"The entire Lu family, including Grandfather Lu Meng, was completely destroyed. Only Lu Shui survived!" Wanglong introduced to Shou Guiwang.

"Tianguiwang, it must be Tiangui Wang. Only his poison could spread throughout Shou Guiwang City!" Shou Guiwang's face darkened, his teeth clenched.

"Only the Lu family was killed. Others were not touched. Only Tiangui Wang has a grudge with the Lu family. Tiangui Wang took advantage of our departure to act!" Shou Guiwang spoke solemnly.

"Old Wang, go personally to the Wheel Rotation Hall and inform Luochen!"

"Tiangui Wang is really overstepping!" Shou Guiwang's body trembled. Tiangui Wang's actions clearly showed no respect for him. If Shou Guiwang could not tolerate this, it would damage his reputation.

But alone, Shou Guiwang couldn't deal with Tiangui Wang. Luochen was now the saint son of the Wheel Rotation Hall and no longer a boy who could be trampled upon.

"Lord Shou Guiwang, please don't inform Luochen!" As soon as Shou Guiwang's words were spoken, a voice echoed in the hall. Lu Shui appeared in the hall with a numb expression.

"Lu Shui, how are you?" Shou Guiwang looked at Lu Shui's pale face as he walked in and extended his hand, sending a surge of ghost energy into Lu Shui's body.

However, Shou Guiwang understood Lu Shui's intention. Although Luochen was the saint son of the Wheel Rotation Hall and had his own connections, the eight heavenly kings were not under the control of the阎罗 ten halls. Not only could Luochen bring people out, but even if he destroyed Tiangui Wang, it would cause dissatisfaction among the other halls. After all, a heavenly king's death was no small matter.

"Revenge is mine to take!" Lu Shui's face was pale, his voice weak. He had watched each of his family members being killed and was left alone. Lu Shui knew it wasn't that they pitied him, but rather that they wanted him to be heartbroken. Sometimes, living was more painful than dying.

"Lu Shui, think carefully. If you do it alone, you may never get revenge. The only one who can help you take revenge is the阎罗 ten halls. Even I can only cause a commotion at Tiangui Wang's place to regain some face, but I can't really deal with Tiangui Wang!" Shou Guiwang's face was dark.

"Yes, I know. If it takes a year, then ten years. If not, then a hundred!" Lu Shui's eyes were determined. His life was destined to live in hatred, but he didn't want Luochen to be like that.

Lu Shui knew that although Luochen was the saint son of the Wheel Rotation Hall, he had few resources to use. Unless Luochen could become the master of the Wheel Rotation Hall.

"I am his father. As long as he is in the Lu family, it's not destroyed!" Lu Shui's voice was resolute.

"Okay! I'll go to Tiangui Wang's city. This matter can't be left unresolved. At least let Tiangui Wang bleed a little!" Shou Guiwang's body moved, and the black Minghu roared, flying out of Shou Guiwang City.

...

On the black plate, Luochen and Fu Xingxuan sat with a serious expression. Waves were emitted from their bodies.

"Buzz..." The Wheel Rotation Plateau spun faster, distorting space. Luochen felt as if he was being pulled by a great force, trying to separate his soul.

"Stay strong!" Luochen and Fu Xingxuan moved their hands, forming hand signs that were imprinted on their bodies. They knew they had to withstand the separation force; otherwise, they would become two people with split minds like Hei Bai Wu Chang.

"External Body Manifestation, come forth!" Luochen moved his hands and spat out blood. At the same time, the black runes gradually gathered and formed a black figure.

"Buzz..." Time passed slowly. Luochen's powerful soul constantly resisted the twisting force. The black figure became more and more solid.

"Almost successful!" Hei Bai Wu Chang sat in the hall, opened his eyes and stared at Luochen and Fu Xingxuan. He knew this was the most critical moment.

As the black figure became more solid, Luochen's face turned pale. The stronger the black figure became, the greater the pulling force trying to extract his soul. It even wanted to cut his soul.

"Stop!" Luochen kept shouting, and his soul trembled violently within his body, resisting the tearing force.

Time passed slowly. Luochen's blood boiled as he finally passed an hour, and the black figure solidified. The black figure gradually faded and turned into Luochen's appearance, appearing in his view.

"Only a simple manifestation. Why did it make me so excited?" Luochen smiled, looking at the figure that was identical to himself.

"Buzz..." As soon as Luochen's external body manifestation was formed, Fu Xingxuan also experienced waves.

A white flower floated above Fu Xingxuan's head, which was the彼岸 flower. However, this彼岸 flower was more holy than any other one Luochen had seen, as if it didn't belong to this world.

A petal fell and entered the black figure's body. Fu Xingxuan's black figure gradually faded, turning into Fu Xingxuan's appearance.

With the formation of their external body manifestations, the rotating plate stopped spinning.

"The bloodline of a reincarnation son is amazing. It's understandable that he could form an external body manifestation. I didn't expect Fu Xingxuan to easily form one as well. Her bloodline had a tremor earlier. What was that?" Hei Bai Wu Chang's eyebrows furrowed as he looked at Fu Xingxuan.

"Her surname is Fu. Could it be..." Hei Bai Wu Chang's eyes flashed with light, and a moment of confusion passed. He reached out his hand and grabbed the true bodies of Luochen and Fu Xingxuan.

"These two external body manifestations will stay in the Wheel Rotation Hall for cultivation. You each control the Battle Platform and the Wicked Mirror. If you leave, we'll be in trouble!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke loudly and explained why he wouldn't let Luochen leave.

"I'll leave the Wicked Mirror behind. An external body manifestation can also activate it!" Luochen's eyes showed joy. This Wheel Rotation Hall would be his last card: an external body manifestation and the Wicked Mirror!

"Yes, it's best to fully merge the external body manifestation when you reach仙王. You can also briefly merge it before reaching仙王 to enhance your strength, but you mustn't merge for more than an hour!"

"You can leave now. No one will stop you. As long as it's not a complete destruction of your body and soul, I don't fear it!" Hei Bai Wu Chang laughed lightly. In the world, few people could destroy someone completely unless they were仙王. Luochen was an exception.

Chapter 2196: Departure

"Go away... go as far as you can!" Hei Bai Wu Chang was quite angry, speaking to Luochen.

Hei Bai Wu Chang couldn't understand why this kid still wanted to go back. As for Luochen's safety, Hei Bai Wu Chang wasn't too worried. Except for仙王, few people could kill Luochen. If Luochen didn't act too recklessly, most仙王 wouldn't go to the extent of destroying him completely.

"Thank you, Master!" Luochen quickly bowed and showed gratitude. Finally, he could leave.

Luochen's eyes were filled with gratitude. If it weren't for the need to return to the celestial realm, he might have truly been reluctant to leave hell. Hei Bai Wu Chang had treated him well, and even Luochen doubted whether Hei Bai Wu Chang had some hidden agenda.

"Buzz..." Hei Bai Wu Chang waved his hand, and Luochen and Fu Xingxuan left the first level, appearing on the thirty-third level.

"Little bastard, you'll definitely come back!" After sending Luochen out, Hei Bai Wu Chang's black and white eyes showed depth as he whispered.

...

"Sweetheart, I'm really leaving this time. Are you coming with me?" Luochen looked at Fu Xingxuan, a smile on his face.

"No. I still need to go into seclusion!" Fu Xingxuan gently shook her head. It was very safe in the Wheel Rotation Hall. If she went with Luochen, it might distract him.

"Okay, I'll leave tomorrow. Will you satisfy me tonight?" Luochen smiled mischievously as he spoke to Fu Xingxuan.

"Can't you think about anything else?" Fu Xingxuan scolded him, but she didn't refuse.

One night passed quietly. The next day, Fu Xingxuan left Luochen's courtyard with a pale face.

"Saintess, what happened to you?" The disciples of the Wheel Rotation Hall showed surprise as they looked at Fu Xingxuan walking towards the Reincarnation Hell.

"Idiot!" Fu Xingxuan's face gradually turned red. Her heart was pounding, and she ran back to the Reincarnation Hell. What Fu Xingxuan didn't see was that as soon as she left, a shadow appeared at the entrance of Luochen's door. Her eyes showed complex feelings.

The woman had a seductive look, watching Fu Xingxuan leave. She turned and stepped into Luochen's courtyard.

"Wow, you really are a demon! My waist!" Luochen lay on his bed, looking like he had been drained completely. He hadn't noticed a figure silently entering.

"Buzz..." A wave of fragrance rose, causing Luochen to show confusion. He looked at the door.

"Xingxuan, why did you come back again? Don't you really want to drain me completely?" Luochen smiled, looking at Fu Xingxuan walking towards him.

"Yes!" Fu Xingxuan nodded gently. Her fiery body rushed forward again.

"Don't... Ah..." Luochen only made a symbolic struggle before being wrapped in fire once more.

Time passed. Two hours had gone by. Fu Xingxuan didn't say a word the entire time, constantly pleasing Luochen and making him unable to stop.

Tired, Luochen fell asleep. He didn't wake up until the afternoon. When he opened his eyes and looked around, he felt something was wrong.

"Hey?" Upon waking up, Luochen immediately sensed something was off. He rarely slept so deeply.

"Something's wrong. Did I really get drained? Too tired?" Luochen muttered to himself, looking around before sighing deeply and getting up.

"Something's definitely wrong!" Luochen put on his clothes, stood up, and felt his legs were weak. He thought he had just returned from Fu Xingxuan's return, as if it were a dream. But it was real.

Luochen stepped out of the door and furrowed his eyebrows, not seeing anyone else. However, there was a lingering fragrance in the air. This scent was familiar to Luochen.

"Sudan!" Luochen recognized this fragrance, and his eyes showed complex feelings.

"Was everything that happened just a dream or was it real?" Luochen whispered to himself, looking into the distance.

"Whether it's real or not, since you chose to run away, I don't need to force it!" Luochen sighed deeply and walked towards Ye Chen's courtyard.

Luochen knew that Sudan had left some shadows in his heart. During the time at the Yin Yang Clan, Sudan's impression was too deep for any man to refuse. However, Luochen knew that he and this woman had no fate together; he already had several wives.

"Maybe it's because of the way Xingxuan was strange later. She was very bold, and some parts were bigger, as if she was another person!" Luochen thought while approaching Ye Chen's courtyard.

Since the time when Luochen and Fu Xingxuan were captured by Hei Bai Wu Chang, Ye Chen had lived there. At first, he was very cautious because Luochen had committed such a big mistake. As his attendant, he naturally wouldn't have a good outcome.

But Ye Chen hadn't expected that Luochen had such great power and was completely unharmed. No one pursued him either.

Ye Chen didn't pay much attention to it, living comfortably there. The thirty-third level had a lot of ghost energy, and his cultivation speed was fast.

"Brother Ye Chen, I'm here!" Luochen laughed as he walked into Ye Chen's courtyard.

Seeing Luochen enter, Ye Chen quickly stood up. He naturally saw Luochen's performance in the ten-hall competition and knew he wasn't his match.

"Maybe only that person could fight him!" Ye Chen looked at Luochen's smiling face and sighed inwardly, thinking of a figure from years ago in the Bu Tian City military camp.

But now Ye Chen didn't think that person was Luochen's match. He was too strong. This was the Wheel Rotation Hall, comparable to nine immortal mountains. In short, this young man before his eyes was undoubtedly the top of the younger generation in hell.

"Brother Ye Chen, let's go and fight!" Luochen spoke boldly to Ye Chen.

"Hmm..." Upon hearing Luochen's words, Ye Chen was slightly surprised. He remembered the time he escaped from the Wheel Rotation Hall and how terrifying it had been, especially thinking of Hei Bai Wu Chang's dark face. Ye Chen felt uncomfortable.

"Don't worry, this time I've received the master's permission!" Luochen patted Ye Chen's shoulder and showed confidence.

Ye Chen looked at Luochen's expression, feeling it was unreliable. However, he knew his current status and didn't dare to contradict Luochen.

"Let's go!" Luochen naturally noticed Ye Chen's reluctance but didn't care much. The two of them moved, and the disciples of the Wheel Rotation Hall looked at them with respect as they left the hall.

Luochen's departure wasn't announced to anyone. He had discussed it with Hei Bai Wu Chang, saying he would be in seclusion within the Reincarnation Hell.

Zhang Tianhe sat in his courtyard. Because of Luochen, Zhang Tianhe lived very comfortably. No one dared to bother him in the Wheel Rotation Hall, and he was responsible for collecting resources.

Zhang Tianhe had become an object of flattery among the disciples of the Wheel Rotation Hall. Zhang Tianhe's favorite thing now was sitting on a rocking chair, being served by two female disciples every day.

"From now on, you keep one-third of the resources. One-third goes to the eight heavenly kings. The remaining one-third is sent to the second level's Fei Gui Pavilion..." As Zhang Tianhe was very comfortable, Luochen's voice echoed in his ears.

"Yes!" Zhang Tianhe quickly stood up and showed respect. He knew that his current status was all thanks to Luochen.

Zhang Tianhe's eyes showed joy. He hadn't expected that Luochen had changed the distribution and given him one-third of it. With this three-tenths income, his cultivation speed would definitely surpass others.

Outside the Wheel Rotation Hall, Luochen and Ye Chen walked out.

"The taste of freedom!" As soon as Luochen stepped out, he looked at the dim sky and took a deep breath.

"Should we hurry?" Ye Chen felt uneasy, looking at the Wheel Rotation Hall's gate, fearing that Hei Bai Wu Chang would come out again.

"Don't worry. We're leaving openly, and no one will stop me!" Luochen spoke loudly and stepped towards the southern direction of the Wheel Rotation Hall.

"Buzz..." As soon as Luochen took a step, waves directly enveloped him and Ye Chen. The power of the world surrounded them.

"Damn it..." Luochen and Ye Chen's hearts slightly startled. Especially Luochen, his face showed disbelief.

"It's impossible! I was already let go!" Luochen muttered to himself, looking at the sky. Four figures stood there: Du Jianxing, Yu Tian and three others who were about to be transferred to the Fire Sea Hell.

"Kid, where are you going?" Du Jianxing's eyebrows slightly furrowed as he looked at Luochen.

"Master, I'm just taking a walk..." Luochen chuckled nervously. He knew Du Jianxing didn't want him to leave the Wheel Rotation Hall.

"Don't talk nonsense with me. You three, as elders, each give him a life-saving technique!" Du Jianxing naturally knew Luochen's intention. He sighed deeply and spoke to the three people beside him.

"Okay!" Yu Tian nodded, not opposing. At the same time, they pointed their fingers and left three imprints on Luochen's body. The sword energy Du Jianxing had previously left in Luochen's body was still there.

"Go!" Du Jianxing looked at the imprints left by the three people and shouted at Luochen. He and Yu Tian flew away, disappearing from Luochen's sight. They weren't there to find Luochen but to go ahead and prepare for the Fire Sea Hell. It was just a coincidence that they met Luochen.

"Thank you, Master!" Luochen quickly spoke and watched Du Jianxing and the others leave. He took a deep breath.

Chapter 2197: Cut Off All Descendants

"Look, I said it was fine. I've already made arrangements!" Luochen spoke to Ye Chen, who had been scared again.

"Let's go!" Luochen looked at the Wheel Rotation Hall with a deep gaze and took off, becoming a long rainbow that disappeared from the spot.

"Really can leave?" Ye Chen's eyes showed excitement. Although he lived comfortably in hell, it was still hell. And he was just an attendant.

Entering the Kanmen, Ye Chen had a chance to return to Bu Tian City and then back to Xinghe Fu.

As he thought of this, Ye Chen's heart trembled. He had had enough and was excited. He took off and chased after Luochen.

Even though he had flown away, Ye Chen was still very nervous. The last time he had flown far and was caught back by Hei Bai Wu Chang.

After they flew for a day, seeing the nearest city to the Wheel Rotation Hall and no one chasing them, Ye Chen finally let out a sigh of relief.

"No one is chasing us!" Ye Chen's eyes showed joy and he sighed deeply.

Luochen also looked relieved, truly fearing another unexpected event. He would have cried if it happened.

They didn't stay in the city but passed through it directly and flew towards the Beast King Mountains.

"First, go check out Shou Guiwang City. Then go to Kanmen. It's on the way!" Luochen made a plan, thinking of his father's warmth and wanting to see Lu Shui and say goodbye.

They flew for seven days, staying in the nearest city of the Beast King Mountains for a day before entering the Beast King Mountains.

"Get out of my way!" Luochen shouted, and his Ghost Seal hovered above his head. It emitted an atmosphere that made the ghost creatures fear, causing Ye Chen to tremble and push through, flying out of the Beast King Mountains.

Time passed. One month had passed since leaving the Wheel Rotation Hall, and Luochen and Ye Chen were only half a month away from Shou Guiwang City.

An imposing city appeared in their view, but it wasn't Shou Guiwang City. It was Tiangui Wang's city.

"Passing through Tiangui Wang's city, we're only a little over half a month away from Shou Guiwang City!" Ye Chen's face showed admiration as he looked at the massive city.

"Tiangui Wang has some history with me. If it were a normal time, I would have fought him. But we're in a hurry. Take me into Tiangui Wang's city!" Luochen sneered and disappeared from Ye Chen's view.

Ye Chen was speechless, not expecting that Luochen had this side. He thought of the time they met in Tiansha City's prison, where Luochen had spoken a lot but achieved everything.

"Damn it, it's all because of you. Why do I like to brag?" Luochen stood on the red earth, muttering.

"Stop talking nonsense. You're the one who made it up. Why blame me?" The Bu Tian Stone wouldn't let Luochen pin the blame on himself and shouted back.

One person, one stone. They argued with each other while Ye Chen stepped into the city of the heavenly king.

Boom...
