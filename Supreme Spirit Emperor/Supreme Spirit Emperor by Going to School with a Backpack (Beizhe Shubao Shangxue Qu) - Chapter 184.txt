The people of the Tianyuan Continent stared in awe at Luo Tian. They had never imagined that the once-proud imperial-robed man, now seemed like a mere chick before Luo Tian, utterly powerless and captured by him.

“What level of strength does Luo Tian possess now?” people murmured in bewilderment, unable to fathom his current cultivation.

“Haha! Having such a brother means I no longer need to walk with my head held high across the Tianyuan Continent!” Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin, two talkative companions, wore triumphant smiles as they burst into laughter.

“Come on, with your strength, you wouldn’t even need to walk sideways across the Tianyuan Continent! Set your sights higher. Beyond the World Master lies the Supreme Lord, and beyond that… what?” Long Jie’s face bore a look of yearning as he gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes brimming with anticipation.

Gu Qianxue and her companion, however, bore a faint trace of melancholy. The gap between them and Luo Tian had grown too vast; they now stood in awe of him.

“We must strive harder, or else we won’t live as long as he does. When we die, he’ll surely find other women—how can that be allowed!” Gu Qianxue was the first to recover, her lips curling as she addressed Leng Qiuchan.

“He dares!” Leng Qiuchan’s exquisite face bore a confident expression, her jade fists clenched tightly as determination flared in her eyes.

Under the watchful gazes of all, Luo Tian soared into the sky above the vast Rebirth Channel. With a single hand extended toward the outer realm of the Tianyuan Continent, he summoned an immense force.

“Boom…!” The earth trembled as Luo Tian’s power struck the floating ancient continent of Xiangu. A deep, resonant sound echoed through the air.

“Peng!” The thunderous noise shook the heavens, scattering debris everywhere. A black bridge emerged from the earth beneath Xiangu, piercing through the realm with a streak of darkness.

“Is that the Rebirth Bridge?” Zheng Xin’s face lit up with astonishment as he gazed at the black bridge spanning the heavens.

Zheng Xin had once been a disciple of the Tian Dao Sect on Xiangu, and he knew of the Rebirth Bridge’s existence. Yet he had never imagined it would remain so intact after the sect’s destruction.

In an instant, the Rebirth Bridge soared toward Luo Tian, who wore a wistful expression. He recalled how he had once struggled to traverse it, now effortlessly commanding its power.

“Rebirth Reformation!” Luo Tian’s hands formed intricate seals, and emerald flames erupted from his palms. With transcendent power, they coalesced into verdant runes that clung to the black bridge.

“Refining!” Luo Tian pressed his hands downward, and a scorching temperature engulfed the Rebirth Bridge. Though seemingly unyielding, it gradually faded into gray under the emerald flames.

Time passed slowly as the black bridge transformed into a uniform gray, matching the Rebirth Channel’s hue.

“Go…” A colossal hand of transcendent power grasped the bridge, merging it seamlessly with the fractured Rebirth Channel. No gap remained.

“Success!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he traced more golden dragon-like runes around the bridge and channel. With a flick of his hand, the runes shattered, and the vast Rebirth Channel restored itself to its original state.

“Hum…” Gray energy re-emerged around the Rebirth Channel, gradually vanishing from sight under the people’s watchful eyes.

As the channel was about to vanish, Luo Tian waved his hand, and a black soul banner materialized in his grasp.

With a wistful expression, Luo Tian planted the banner into the void: “All ancestors, the Rebirth Channel has been restored. Please return to rebirth!”

Luo Tian’s voice echoed across the Tianyuan Continent, halting the残魂 (residual souls) of the Yin Domain that had been devouring corpses.

The battlefield was already over; the Yin Domain’s forces could not match the residual souls’ might. In mere moments, they were devoured and scattered into oblivion.

Hearing Luo Tian’s voice, the residual souls rushed toward him, their gazes filled with reverence.

“Not entering… guarding…” A wave of thoughts flooded Luo Tian’s mind, causing his eyes to well with tears.

The word “guarding” shook Luo Tian’s soul. He understood these residual souls wished to protect the Tianyuan Continent, refusing rebirth.

Their strength was formidable; if they refused rebirth, it would become a powerful force for both Luo Tian and the Tianyuan Continent.

Yet Luo Tian could not allow this. These were heroes of the Tianyuan Continent, and he would not selfishly demand they continue fighting even as残魂.

The people on the ground watched Luo Tian, hearing his words. They vaguely guessed what he meant and bowed respectfully to the countless residual souls hovering in the sky.

“Respected elders, I swear I will protect the Tianyuan Continent. As long as I draw breath, this land shall never fall! From now on, the Tianyuan Continent will rise again. This is my promise to your ancestors!” Luo Tian bowed deeply, his face etched with reverence.

“Roar…” The residual souls let out low growls, their thoughts imbued with satisfaction. Led by ten nine-source residual souls, they departed into the Rebirth Channel with reluctant hearts.

“Hum…” As thousands of residual souls vanished, the Rebirth Channel hummed and disappeared from sight. Golden sunlight bathed the Tianyuan Continent once more, while the black Tianyuan battle banner fluttered defiantly in the wind.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, whispering to himself: “The second task is complete. The next is you—Epoch Book! After years, your master has returned!”

Chapter 848: The Yin Domain’s First Day ()

Luo Tian gazed upward at the Epoch Book, still spewing blood-like energy. A smile tugged his lips. This artifact had changed his life, and even now as a transcendent-level cultivator, he felt layers of mist obscuring his vision.

Luo Tian soared forward to the Epoch Book, a golden sheet of paper emerging from his mind. It radiated brilliant gold light, forming a golden thread that shot toward the Epoch Book above.

“Indeed! This golden sheet is undoubtedly a fragment of the Epoch Book! But who possesses such power to tear it apart? And how many fragments remain, scattered across the realms?” Luo Tian’s mind brimmed with questions as he stared at the unified Epoch Book.

“Never mind! I’ll find out later!” Luo Tian knew guessing was futile. He waved his hand, and the black Rupture Spear materialized in his grip, a grin spreading across his face.

“Now, won’t you emerge?” Luo Tian’s voice transformed into a green lightning bolt, striking the blood-like ocean within the Epoch Book.

“Why is Luo Tian still carrying that Rupture Spear?” The people on the ground murmured, watching Luo Tian with battle-ready eyes.

But in an instant, their relief turned to alarm as they saw Luo Tian’s fierce expression. They brandished their weapons cautiously, eyes wary of the massive Epoch Book before them.

“Hmph, kid, you’ve got some moves! You’ve discovered my presence!” A cold voice echoed from the Epoch Book, shaking the minds of all present.

“Not done yet!” Their gazes flickered with complexity; even capturing this imperial-robed youth was just the beginning.

The captured imperial-robed man, battered and broken, wore a triumphant grin. His eyes flashed with cruelty as he stared at Luo Tian in the sky.

His face was gaunt, his frustration unbearable. How could a mere World Master-level disciple dare to torment him? This was the first time in years.

“Think you’ve won by capturing me? I’m just a vanguard! The main force of the Yin Domain’s first realm is coming soon. This Tianyuan Continent will fall—just a matter of time!” The man sneered at Luo Tian.

“Silence him!” Luo Tian ignored the man, barking at Gu Lei and others. His gaze was cautious as he watched the black-cloaked figures emerging from the Epoch Book.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected the Yin Domain’s first realm to be this powerful; even the hundreds of strong warriors before him left him awestruck.

They lined up, and under Luo Tian’s solemn gaze, the black army appeared in the sky above the Tianyuan Continent. Though vast and unyielding, they were orderly, without crowding.

“Roar…” A million black-cloaked warriors let out a low growl, their battle aura forming an actual blood-red dragon that surged toward Luo Tian and his companions.

Luo Tian’s face darkened as he stood before the people of the Tianyuan Continent, unleashing a transcendent-level aura that repelled the blood-red dragon.

Luo Tian estimated the million warriors: ten thousand alone were Supreme Lords, a testament to the Yin Domain’s might. Even their first realm was this formidable.

“Hmph, how did the Emperor manage to take such a small Tianyuan Continent? Ah, it’s because this continent birthed a transcendent!” The middle-aged man above the million warriors narrowed his eyes, spotting Luo Tian.

“Indeed, the Tianyuan Continent has endured years of hardship and still produced a transcendent. Truly remarkable!” The man mused, his eyes filled with nostalgia as he recalled the Tianyuan Continent’s resilience against nine saintly forces.

As the million black-cloaked warriors appeared, despair washed over the Tianyuan Continent’s people.

Though their cultivation was low, they felt the overwhelming power of the million warriors. Without Luo Tian’s protection, they wouldn’t have survived even that roar.

“Luo Tian, leave! Your strength can escape the Tianyuan Continent!” The people of the Tianyuan Continent smiled bitterly, watching Luo Tian stand resolute in the sky.

“Yes, leave! Luo Tian, the Tianyuan Continent will fall eventually. We are your burden!” They spoke one after another, their eyes filled with bitterness.

“Silence! Do you think I lack confidence? If I did, I would have left the residual souls of our ancestors!” Luo Tian’s eyes glinted with a smile, offering them reassurance. His voice carried unyielding authority.

“Hmph…” The middle-aged man’s face twisted with mockery.

“You’re strong, transcendent-level. Even I, a fellow transcendent, can’t match you. You could escape, but these people of the Tianyuan Continent cannot!” His voice dripped with disdain.

“Who do you think you are to destroy our Tianyuan Continent? You’re dreaming! Today, I declare: no one can destroy this land unless the nine realms of the Yin Domain or those nine old corpses emerge. Not because I’m back!” Luo Tian’s voice thundered with unshakable authority, his eyes blazing as he stood in the void.

The people on the ground, seeing Luo Tian’s overwhelming aura, gradually regained hope, their eyes flickering with excitement.

Indeed, Luo Tian was a miracle of the Tianyuan Continent—nothing was beyond his reach. If he spoke these words, he must have absolute confidence.

Yet, Luo Tian’s heart drummed anxiously: “Nan Gong Yuqing, Sisi… hurry! With so many enemies, I’m barely holding on!”

Though his heart raced, he dared not show it. He feared the middle-aged man would notice his delay. His face remained calm, a mask of composure.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected the Yin Domain’s first realm to be this powerful. He regretted not having the strength to escape.

But he couldn’t leave. Behind him were his loved ones and friends. Could he live selfishly while they faced death? He had left before out of necessity, but the Tianyuan Continent still had a chance. If he fled now, these people would never survive the Supreme Lord’s onslaught. Even a few Heaven-Transcendents couldn’t handle them.

The middle-aged man’s identity was clear—leader of the Yin Domain’s first realm, his every move calculated. Though Luo Tian performed well, he couldn’t hide from such a seasoned veteran.

“You’re stalling! You have reinforcements!” The man’s face curled with amusement, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Indeed, but I can afford to stall!” Luo Tian grabbed the imperial-robed man still under Gu Lei’s torment, his eyes flashing with menace.

“Want your son dead? Try it! You decide!” Luo Tian’s voice carried a ruthless edge, his heart racing as he gambled on the man’s regard for his son.

“You…” The middle-aged man’s eyes flashed with murderous intent, his fists clenching tightly.

“Correct!” Seeing the man’s expression, Luo Tian knew he had won.

“What do you want?” The middle-aged man, a seasoned transcendent, quickly regained composure. His gaze was calm as he faced Luo Tian.

The imperial-robed man in Luo Tian’s grip was indeed his son. No father would want their child dead, even if they were of the Yin Domain—cold and ruthless. Yet, this law was universal.

“Nothing much. I want you to withdraw from the Tianyuan Continent. Obviously, you won’t. You’ve come out, so you’ll return!”

“Step back! Let’s fight first to warm up. If you kill me, your forces will suffer fewer losses!” Luo Tian smiled, his gaze meeting the middle-aged man’s.

The man’s eyes flared with anger, his aura rising as he locked eyes with Luo Tian.

“Good! It’s been years since I’ve fought someone outside the Yin Domain. Let me test your strength, the Tianyuan Continent’s prodigy!” The middle-aged man exhaled deeply and reluctantly agreed.

If he refused, not only would he fail his son but also betray his subordinates.

Luo Tian was a transcendent, and their million elite warriors could kill him—but at great cost. If he refused, it would show disregard for his subordinates’ lives, which would break their morale.

Hearing the middle-aged man’s agreement, Luo Tian’s face regained confidence. He silently prayed: “This time should be enough!”

Chapter 849: The Legend ()

Under the endless stars of the Tianyuan Continent, two powerful figures faced each other. Invisible waves formed between them, a subtle connection drawing the onlookers’ awe.

Around them stood over a million black-cloaked warriors, their faces cold and fierce, watching the young man standing defiantly in the stars.

Luo Tian had insisted on moving the battlefield outside the Tianyuan Continent to avoid harming its people.

“You’re strong, kid. But you still lack a touch compared to me. I can sense your recent ascension to transcendent—your cultivation is stable, but you’re no match for me!” The middle-aged man smiled, brandishing a gray long sword. His gaze was dismissive as he faced Luo Tian.

Luo Tian nodded inwardly, recognizing the man’s steady aura—clearly no easy opponent. As a transcendent of the Yin Domain, his survival in such a ruthless realm meant he was no pushover. Though confident, Luo Tian remained cautious, his black Rupture Spear humming as he awaited the man’s move.

The middle-aged man’s subordinates sneered, whispering among themselves.

“This kid is a genius, but who are you comparing him to? When our Lord ascended to transcendent, he bloodily cleansed the Yin Domain’s first realm. This kid might not even be born yet!” A nine-source Yin Domain warrior spoke.

“Indeed, he’s overconfident. But it’s just stalling for reinforcements. Back then, the Four Saintly Star Realms were wiped out by our forces. I wonder what he’s waiting for!” Two more nine-source Supreme Lords joined in, their sneers echoing.

Due to cultivation limits, only three Tianyuan Continent disciples—Gu Lei, Long Jie, and Jiang Nanxuan—stood in the stars. Their eyes brimmed with deep concern, unsure how Luo Tian would face this crisis.

Especially Jiang Nanxuan, whose sharp mind and meticulous nature allowed him to sense the anxiety in Luo Tian’s earlier reassuring gaze.

“Transcendent-level, I’ve fought before. Killing me won’t be easy!” Luo Tian smiled, responding to the man’s words.

But as he spoke, the middle-aged man vanished from his spot. A wave of gray energy formed a streak of light, rushing toward Luo Tian. In an instant, a black long sword appeared above him, causing his eyes to narrow.

“Finally, you’ve moved!” Though Luo Tian seemed relaxed, his body remained tense. He knew facing such a powerhouse required absolute vigilance; one mistake would mean no chance to fight back.

The black Rupture Spear met the gray sword’s slash, clashing with a resounding “Crack!” Lightning crackled around them as fire erupted at the collision point, causing onlookers to shrink back.

Too fast—transcendent-level combat was beyond even Supreme Lords’ comprehension. The speed surpassed time itself, leaving people hearing only a thunderous roar as two dark lights collided.

Gu Lei, Long Jie, and Jiang Nanxuan were stunned, their eyes vacant as they were sent flying thousands of feet by the invisible waves. Their faces grimaced as they landed.

Though they knew Luo Tian and the middle-aged man were strong, they hadn’t expected them to be this powerful—beyond human cultivators’ limits.

“This is what Luo Tian called transcendent-level? Terrifying!” Their eyes gleamed with admiration, their minds echoing a single thought: transcendence. Achieve it! Overcome all power!

As people marveled, Luo Tian and the middle-aged man reappeared in their sight.

Luo Tian’s face bore a faint pallor, his gaze more intense but with a hint of amusement. After their brief clash, he had roughly assessed the man’s strength—slightly stronger than Sun Mingtian from the Feng Shen Continent. His current state was no match for the man, but after entering his demonic mode, it would be the opponent who suffered.

“Still not the time yet!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with contemplation, whispering to himself.

Luo Tian had his plans. If he entered demonic mode now, the man would be no match. But he didn’t know what tricks the middle-aged man had. If he fled, it would be a loss.

Even if the man died, his million subordinates would attack the Tianyuan Continent’s people. Though he could block some, he couldn’t stop all. If a Heaven-Transcendent escaped, it would be a disaster for the Tianyuan Continent.

The Tianyuan Continent was too fragile to withstand Heaven-Transcendent attacks. Thus, Luo Tian had to wait for Jiang Sisi and Nan Gong Yuqing’s arrival. That was when he would unleash his full power. For now, he had to endure and stall time.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian pondered, the middle-aged man’s sword slashed through space again, rushing toward Luo Tian with an overwhelming aura.

“Pf…” This strike wasn’t a test but the man’s full power, capable of slicing through a star. It could kill any nine-source cultivator and wound a transcendent.

Luo Tian had been distracted, briefly losing focus. The man’s strike was too fast; Luo Tian cursed inwardly and raised his Rupture Spear.

Luo Tian’s speed was fast, but the man’s was faster. The sword struck Luo Tian’s shoulder, and their distance closed instantly.

Their eyes met, and Luo Tian saw the man’s mocking gaze: “Kid, dare to be distracted while fighting me?”

“Pf…” The sword pierced his body, cold energy flooding him as blood splattered across the stars.

“Lord, your might!” The middle-aged man’s subordinates roared as his sword entered Luo Tian.

Luo Tian transformed into a streak of light, plummeting downward. Gu Lei, Jiang Nanxuan, and Long Jie cried out in alarm.

Though they hadn’t seen the fight, they saw the blood splatter and heard the million Yin Domain warriors’ roars. They knew Luo Tian was injured.

Luo Tian’s body collided with a lifeless star, his face pale as he闪动 (dodged), reappearing in sight. His body radiated green light, surrounded by thunderous lightning.

“Hmph?” The middle-aged man’s face showed confusion. He had been confident in wounding Luo Tian, but now seeing his condition—only a one-inch wound on the shoulder—he realized it wasn’t as severe as he’d thought.

“Strong physique, a tough kid. He’s got some backbone!” The middle-aged man nodded slightly, then闪动 (dodged) again, rushing toward Luo Tian without giving him a moment to breathe.

Seeing this, Luo Tian’s face turned fierce. His black vortex in the丹田 (cultivation core) spun wildly, gathering transcendent power into his hands. It healed his shoulder wound and suppressed the gray storm within him.

He闪动 (dodged), gathering green lightning around his body, merging it with the Rupture Spear to clash against the middle-aged man again.

Luo Tian fought desperately, matching the middle-aged man’s strength. The thunderous sound echoed in people’s ears as stars shattered around them. Their power even affected the Tianyuan Continent and the adjacent Xiangu Continent, toppling mountains.

The people of the Tianyuan Continent felt their skies trembling, worry flooding their hearts.

“I am Luo Tian’s father. I should have shielded him, but instead, my son fights for me against others!” Luo Nan Tian’s face bore pain and regret. He hated his weakness, his helplessness.

This sentiment wasn’t unique to Luo Nan Tian; all the people of the Tianyuan Continent felt it, their eyes filled with blood-red rage.

“Hum…” As if drawn by something, those close to Luo Tian began emitting various lights, illuminating the entire Tianyuan Continent.

“What’s happening?” People looked at those glowing individuals, their eyes wide with disbelief.

They felt the light-emitting people’s power rising rapidly, their cultivation increasing at a terrifying speed.

“This is…” Some elders’ faces lit up with excitement, recalling an ancient rumor.

Chapter 850: Time Just Right ()

The Tianyuan Continent erupted with countless lights, powerful waves rising into the sky. The people’s faces lit up with joy.

“This is… bloodline power!” Elderly voices murmured, gazing at those glowing individuals. They noticed a pattern: these people were from the Luo Family of the Southern Region’s Ice Pole Island.

“Legend says, when a strong cultivator reaches an extraordinary level, their relatives’ bloodlines change. In special circumstances, if awakened, their strength rises rapidly! This is the origin of ‘one person’s success elevates all under heaven’!” An elder mused, his eyes filled with envy as he watched the Luo Family’s members.

Hearing this, Gu Yun’s face turned shocked. He recalled his own awakening of bloodline power and realized the ancient Gu Family had also produced such a prodigy.

“Roar…” Low growls echoed in people’s ears.

Luo Nan Tian and his wife, along with Luo Xiong, were Luo Tian’s closest blood relatives. Their cultivation soared from the peak of soul formation to half-step Supreme Lord, needing only one source of origin to become a one-source Supreme Lord.

Luo Han and Luo Qingqing, two prodigies of the Ice Pole Island, were no less determined. Their exceptional talent kept them at half-step Supreme Lord.

Other Luo Family members, like Luo Zhan and Luo Tai, also advanced to the World Master level. In the past, this would have been a meteoric rise.

“Such a fortunate family!” People marveled, gazing at each Luo Family member.

But soon, their gazes shifted as lights flared again. To their shock, the Gu Family members also emitted golden light.

“This is the Gu Family! Did their ancestors produce a prodigy too? But why did they fall into this state?” People gasped, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Even the Gu Family members looked confused, unsure why this happened.

Luo Tian was already considered family to the Gu Family. They felt his battle outside the Tianyuan Continent and were desperate to break through it.

Fueled by anger, their blood seemed to unleash a terrifying power, rapidly boosting their cultivation.

Gu Qianxue remained at half-step Supreme Lord, her face puzzled. She wondered who their ancestors were and why the Gu Family had fallen so low.

Not just the Gu Family, others also emitted golden light. Some saw their strength rise significantly, but none matched the Luo and Gu Families’ collective enhancement.

“Father, what’s happening?” The Gu Family members turned to Gu Yun, recalling his own awakening of bloodline power.

“I don’t know! I only know our ancestors were a prodigy, but why they fell… it’s too long ago. As the Gu Family declined, their legacy was lost to time!” Gu Yun gazed at Tian Bo.

He learned this from Tian Bo during his bloodline awakening. At the time, he was shocked to learn the Gu Family had once produced a prodigy.

Hearing Gu Yun’s words, Tian Bo shook his head, unsure of the Gu Family’s former glory. But if someone could reach Luo Tian’s level, they must have been a dominant force on the Tianyuan Continent.

People watched those with rapidly rising cultivation, their faces filled with envy. Yet soon, it faded.

Though this bloodline awakening added many World Masters and even half-step Supreme Lords to the Tianyuan Continent, it was still far inferior to the Yin Domain’s terrifying forces. It was futile.

…

Outside the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian remained unaware of how his battle had elevated the continent’s strength. He was fully immersed in a state of unity with heaven and self, clashing with Meng Guangxiu.

Though in this state, Luo Tian still faced disadvantage, his body riddled with wounds that healed themselves.

Meng Guangxiu also paid a price, as Luo Tian’s transcendent power was no ordinary force. His battle state made him an unpredictable opponent.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s eyes opened, five seals forming instantly. Each seal struck Meng Guangxiu’s body.

Meng Guangxiu, clearly exhausted, grinned fiercely and ignored the seals’ power. He extended his hands, three palms striking with terrifying waves toward Luo Tian.

The onlookers gaped in disbelief at the fierce combat between Luo Tian and Meng Guangxiu.

“This kid is truly troublesome! The Lord used his Heaven-Transcendent Three Palms! This should decide the battle!” Black-cloaked Yin Domain warriors murmured, their eyes wide as they watched the three monstrous hands.

The three hands seemed to have no front or back, each carrying a wave capable of crushing stars. Even the Tianyuan Continent would be shattered under their power.

“Luo Tian…” Gu Lei, Long Jie, and Jiang Nanxuan clenched their fists tightly, their eyes blood-red with worry.

But they could only watch. These three monstrous hands felt like divine punishment, beyond their ability to withstand. Even from afar, their bodies trembled.

“Peng…” As people marveled, Luo Tian’s five seals and Meng Guangxiu’s three palms collided with him. Both men retreated, stars shattering along their path into fragments floating before them.

“Peng… Peng…” Thunderous noises echoed in people’s ears, even the three nine-source Supreme Lords were shaken.

Luo Tian retreated and opened his eyes, returning from the unity with heaven state. He felt his entire body was no longer his own—this sensation had only occurred since he entered the Supreme Lord level, except for that time in Qinglong Sect when the sect master tried to possess him.

Before he could react, another two hands struck him, finally causing his mouth to spew blood. His face turned as pale as paper.

“I’m injured!” Luo Tian felt the three palm strikes had wounded him deeply, even his black vortex in the丹田 (cultivation core) seemed to stop.

Compared to Luo Tian, Meng Guangxiu’s condition was much better. Though his face was pale, he quickly steadied himself. His chest had bruises and dents.

“Kid, now what do you have left to fight with?” Meng Guangxiu’s face twisted with cruelty. His chest slowly healed, and he brandished his gray long sword again, rushing toward the retreating Luo Tian.

“I can’t hold on any longer! I must reveal my secret!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed weakness. He formed seals, and the black vortex in his丹田 (cultivation core) spun violently. A humming sound echoed within, and black energy flowed from his body into Luo Tian’s.

“Demonic Transformation…” Luo Tian’s low roar caused Meng Guangxiu to pause momentarily.

“Even now, you have a secret?” Meng Guangxiu’s face showed confusion as he gazed at Luo Tian, now enveloped in black mist.
