The group arrived at the allied forces of the major sects with a narrow escape. Everyone sighed in relief, for though the journey seemed simple, they all knew that those few hundred feet had been extremely arduous. Over sixty people had either become separated from the group or perished under the assault of the Sky Corpse Sect.

These individuals were prodigies from top-tier sects, their status not matching that of Ying Hongtu and others, but their strength was undeniably among the best in the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage.

Meanwhile, several Sky Corpse Sect warriors at the peak of Bone-Devouring had been intercepted by sects' own Bone-Devouring peak masters. Powerful fluctuations spread in all directions.

Lei Yong sighed inwardly, grateful they had run fast enough; otherwise, being intercepted by those Bone-Devouring peak warriors would have been a major problem.

"Master! Our numbers are dwindling! What should we do?!" The only remaining black-cloaked disciple beside Yang Huanyu looked anxious, shouting at him.

"Use the Corpse Control Talismans! With so many dead, not using them would be a waste!" Yang Huanyu's eyes gleamed with amusement.

Upon hearing Yang Huanyu's command, the Sky Corpse Sect warriors' faces lit up with understanding. Their gazes flashed coldly; they didn't need to aim specifically, merely tossing a talisman would cause it to land on the corpses scattered across the ground.

The remaining ten thousand Sky Corpse Sect disciples raised their Corpse Control Talismans, and a shower of yellow talismans filled the sky like rain, descending upon the fallen bodies.

"One... one thousand... ten thousand..." Countless corpses rose from the ground under the talismans' control, some being Sky Corpse Sect warriors, others major sect disciples.

"Ah!" The major sect disciples' faces showed grief; these corpses were their sect's elders, brothers, or friends. Though dead, they could not bring themselves to strike.

This situation unfolded across the major sects, instantly causing chaos. The Sky Corpse Sect, now reduced to one thousand, seized the opportunity to continue throwing Corpse Control Talismans onto the corpses.

This scenario saw the Sky Corpse Sect's numbers swell, and with this shift in momentum, both sides were once again evenly matched.

"Damn Sky Corpse Sect! We'll fight to the end!" The disciples roared, continuing their slaughter without regard for whether the corpses were once their companions. They knew that if they didn't act decisively, more comrades would perish and be controlled by the Sky Corpse Sect to attack their side.

Numbers dwindled as the major sect disciples grew ruthless, reclaiming the upper hand. After all, these corpses were merely lifeless bodies with greatly diminished strength and were quickly subdued by the sect disciples, leaving no intact corpses.

At this moment, Luo Tian's heart ached; he didn't know why, but he felt these deaths were somehow his fault, causing him deep distress.

Watching each major sect disciple fall, most of whom he didn't know, but seeing these living souls collapse beneath his feet without even a complete corpse left behind, he felt an involuntary tremble.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen constantly protected Luo Tian, noticing his dazed state. They stepped in front of him to comfort: "Junior Brother, this is war—a battle against the Sky Corpse Sect that has never ceased since ancient times!"

Lei Yong's words were clear to Luo Tian, who nodded slightly. He thrust his crackling spear into the throat of a Sky Corpse Sect disciple at the Bone-Devouring Ninth Stage, his face resolute. He gazed at the remaining over ten thousand Sky Corpse Sect black-cloaked disciples struggling desperately, his face filled with savage killing intent. Luo Tian had never felt such intense hatred toward any sect or clan, not even when the Feiyun Sect had once forced him so harshly.

But the Sky Corpse Sect was different; their cruelty defied human description, even surpassing that of ferocious beasts.

Luo Tian didn't know how to deal with them, only knowing he must kill. Such a sect should not exist; it was the embodiment of disaster.

Thinking this, Luo Tian wielded his crackling spear, directing all his resentment toward the Sky Corpse Sect. Though only at Bone-Devouring Ninth Stage, with his current strength, even a typical Bone-Devouring Initial Stage opponent could not withstand him. Plus, Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Dong Sansi were assisting.

In truth, Luo Tian hadn't moved from his spot; the Sky Corpse Sect all knew that the Young Master had issued an order to capture Luo Tian. Thus, most saw Luo Tian and charged toward him fearlessly, making this area the deadliest place for killing.

Time passed slowly; no one knew how long they had fought, leaving only残肢断臂 scattered across the ground.

The Sky Corpse Sect was at a numerical disadvantage, despite their initial surprise attack on Luo Tian. They could not match the prepared major sects. It was said that even without their elite forces, the remaining numbers were enough for the major sects.

Three days passed in a blink, and the Sky Corpse Sect finally could not endure, being surrounded by major sects until only a thousand remained.

The major sects also suffered heavy casualties; excluding the wounded, they were left with only one or two thousand. The pungent scent of blood spread across a hundred miles.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed, like the roar of heaven itself, as a series of breaking sounds came from the sky.

The fighting parties paused, especially the Sky Corpse Sect members, who looked with hope toward their Yuanling Stage (Soul-Annihilation Stage) masters. If they won, it would not be a defeat.

Yang Huanyu also bore an expression of hope; at this point, the Sky Corpse Sect's situation was desperate. Even he had to join the battle.

Chapter 288: Blood-Red Array

Chapter 288: Blood-Red Array

A powerful fluctuation emerged from the sky, accompanied by cracks in space. Thunderous sounds echoed as several figures appeared above, their backs adorned with qi wings that fluttered constantly, proving they were masters of the heavens.

"Roar..." A dragon roared, but its voice carried a sorrowful tone, for some of their companions had perished or been injured in this battle.

At the Yuanling Stage, mutual kills were rare among equals unless one was an extraordinary genius like Luo Tian, Ying Hongtu, or Lei Yong. Even then, it was only a possibility; escaping was still highly likely at this level.

However, both sides' Yuanling Stage masters had lost several members; the remaining ones were wounded and eyed each other with hostility.

Luo Tian's gaze turned to the sky, where Zhang Ziping and Tian Bo were among the Yuanling Stage masters. This eased the tension of Luo Tian and Lei Yong.

"Wei Mingxuan, you truly cannot kill us. Don't dream of it; hand over that Luo boy to us, and we'll promise never to appear in the Northern Region again! Otherwise, even if we fall today, more masters will come. Are you sure your Northern Region can withstand our Sky Corpse Sect?" A black-cloaked elder coughed up blood.

Though his words were defiant, he secretly desired to retreat; no one wanted to die here. He glanced at Yang Huanyu still present, feeling a slight relief.

Yet when he saw the one or two thousand under his control reduced to less than a thousand, his heart bled. After this battle, the Sky Corpse Sect's forces in the Northern Region were nearly annihilated—these were years of effort and cultivation, now uprooted. How could he not grieve?

"Daydream! Do you think our Sky Corpse Sect has any credibility? Leave the Northern Region, or today is your death!" The Thunderclap Sect's master, surrounded by lightning, shouted.

"Right! Leave... or die!" Several Yuanling Stage masters echoed.

They did not wish to let these Sky Corpse Sect remnants go, but the situation was clear. Even if they fought their hardest, it would be impossible to capture the remaining Sky Corpse Sect members. If they did, these masters might barely survive, and the Northern Region would still be in chaos. Now that the Sky Corpse Sect had only this few left, they could not stir up much trouble. It was better to let them leave first and plan later.

"Daydream! You should know our Sky Corpse Sect's style—never giving up until the goal is achieved!" The black-cloaked elder's face was wild, but his mind echoed Yang Huanyu's command: to capture Luo Tian at all costs. Otherwise, with his personality, he would have ordered the Sky Corpse Sect masters to minimize losses and disperse.

On the ground, Yang Huanyu's face remained calm, his eyes filled with fervor as he gazed at Luo Tian. "It seems I must use my final move; otherwise, today would be quite difficult!"

Yang Huanyu spoke and retreated to the back of the crowd. A series of blood-red soul-binding pearls appeared in his hands, which he shattered.

The shattered soul-binding pearls did not scatter but instead entered the ground in an orderly manner under Yang Huanyu's control.

At this moment, people's attention was on the Yuanling Stage masters in the sky and did not notice Yang Huanyu's subtle actions. Only a few Sky Corpse Sect disciples at the back saw what he was doing, their eyes trembling.

These were soul-binding pearls, forged with countless blood and essence—yet in Yang Huanyu's hands, they seemed as ordinary as a water cup. He smashed them without hesitation.

More astonishing was that the thick blood qi did not disperse but instead seemed to possess sentience, obeying Yang Huanyu's commands.

Feeling Yang Huanyu's actions, the black-cloaked elder on the sky also showed a hint of confusion but only that. He had received Yang Huanyu's transmission earlier, asking him to delay time; obviously, he had his own plan.

"Wei Mingxuan! There's no negotiation? Are you determined to fight us to the end? You know, today you've cornered us, but it's not so difficult to let us go!" The black-cloaked elder began to stall.

Wei Mingxuan and the other major sect masters furrowed their brows, puzzled by the black-cloaked elder's sudden change. He had been so resolute before but now was hesitating.

"Leave! Otherwise, I'll have to summon our sect's soul-annihilation stage masters to exterminate you!" Wei Mingxuan did not want to give the Sky Corpse Sect a chance and spoke, holding up his sect's highest authority jade token.

The other sect masters did the same, each revealing their sect's symbols. They clearly did not believe the Sky Corpse Sect would surrender and planned to unleash their sect's soul-annihilation stage masters, exterminating these people and restoring peace to the Northern Region.

"Buzz..." As both sides' Yuanling Stage masters stood tense, another critical moment arose when Yang Huanyu's massive array, built from the blood qi of soul-binding pearls, was finally completed and embedded into the ground.

"Finally done!" Yang Huanyu's calm face was drenched in sweat as he sighed.

His hands moved swiftly, his grey qi constantly pulsing rhythmically on his fingers, a smile forming on his face: "Since you refuse to hand over the boy, I'll have to do it myself!"

His fingers struck the ground fiercely, a wild look on his face.

"Buzz..." As Yang Huanyu's hand met the ground, a powerful qi fluctuation emerged from it, sending blood columns soaring into the sky.

"What is this?" Wei Mingxuan and others showed confusion; as Yuanling Stage masters, they could clearly sense the blood columns' uniqueness but felt no danger.

Everyone watched the ten-foot-long blood column cautiously, while Yang Huanyu knelt on its center. The blood qi met him and seemed to flee like a mouse encountering a cat, avoiding even the slightest touch.

Everyone watched the towering blood column, but one person's face turned pale and his feet left the ground, flying into the sky.

Chapter 290: The Dragon Emperor's Secret Strategy

Chapter 290: The Dragon Emperor's Secret Strategy

All eyes were drawn to the golden mark on Luo Tian's forehead. Clouds of qi gathered in the sky, converging over them—this was the sign of Yuanqi Rain when Luo Tian had just obtained the Epoch Book!

"Such dense qi clouds! If I could absorb one, I'd be able to advance to the Bone-Devouring Stage!" A Thunderclap Sect disciple at the ninth stage of cultivation shouted.

Not only him, but Wei Mingxuan and other major sect masters also showed admiration at the qi clouds' unprecedented density.

Far in the Western Regions, a place long shrouded in toxic gas, bones of humans and ferocious beasts lay scattered, indicating this toxic area was a forbidden land.

Yet within the toxic gas, a massive barrier seemed to isolate it, and groups of black-cloaked disciples with moon symbols on their collars walked within without fear of the toxic gas entering.

This was the Sky Corpse Sect's lair, renowned across the continent and once causing chaos. No one expected it to be stationed in this desolate place.

A grand hall stood at the center of the barrier, deep underground ten thousand feet. In a cave, an old man lay on a broken bed, seemingly lifeless. His body radiated a terrifying aura; merely this power could suppress Yuanling Stage masters, leaving them powerless to resist.

At the moment Luo Tian's Epoch Book revealed a fragment, the lifeless old man suddenly opened his eyes.

Red light illuminated the cave; these eyes carried an ancient aura, as if seeing everything across space. His withered lips curled into a strange smile, sending chills down the spine. In that instant, he closed his eyes again, returning to a lifeless state, no breath, no heartbeat. Deep underground, silence returned.

In the Southern Region's icy glaciers, a middle-aged couple sat cross-legged, their faces showing anxiety. The woman repeatedly stood up but was stopped by the man each time.

"You're stopping me again!" The woman's face showed madness, shouting.

"Stay calm! I don't care less than you do, but trust that elder! Even if we go now, it won't help. With our speed, reaching the Northern Region would take a day!" The man's eyes were red, almost roaring.

The woman tightly gripped her white hands, eventually calming down. Her face bore cold killing intent as she picked up her sword and leapt into the space rift.

"Human! You still want to kill my descendants! If I escape, I'll definitely exterminate you! This cursed seal!" After the white-cloaked woman entered the space rift, a low roar echoed from within.

At Feiyun Sect's cemetery, an old guardian leisurely sunbathed. In that moment, he suddenly opened his eyes, casting lightning-like glances into the void before closing them again, his brows slightly furrowed.

Not only these people; at this moment, all the continent's core powers opened their eyes, then as if recalling something, returned to their tasks.

In the Great An Forest, Long Jian was playing chess with his wife when he suddenly looked up at the sky, murmuring: "Luo Tian and Long'er are in trouble!"

"Clack..." The white-haired Bai Yuqin's chess piece fell onto the board as she thought, her eyes showing concern.

"Why are you still standing here? Hurry up and save them!" Bai Yuqin shouted.

"Don't worry; didn't you forget the mark I left on Luo Tian? It hasn't been triggered yet, so there's still a chance!" Long Jian comforted his wife.

At this moment, Zhang Ziping and others were unaware of what had happened; the Epoch Book had already revealed another fragment, leaving them stunned.

The qi clouds in the sky became denser, gradually converging together.

"Master! Please come out! Even a soul-body would be better! Otherwise, the little master might truly be doomed!" Lei Yong prayed silently.

Luo Tian was unaware of these matters; he didn't know how to change the Epoch Book's fate, so he could only desperately control his mind to slow it down. The splitting pain on his forehead was even forgotten.

"Give up! Luo Tian! I never expected the Epoch Book to be so easily obtained!" Yang Huanyu laughed, completing his hand seals and reaching for the Epoch Book now one-fifth exposed.

"Done!" Luo Tian sighed in despair, his eyes filled with strong resentment; he didn't want to die here. He still had many unfinished things, and he was truly resentful!

Seeing Yang Huanyu approaching step by step, Luo Tian sighed inwardly: "Sorry, Long'er; you'll also have to die with me!"

Luo Tian felt he had betrayed Long'er the most. If he died, then his companion Long'er would also inevitably die without a chance of survival. This made Luo Tian unable to accept it.

"Boom..." Zhang Ziping and Tian Bo's eyes turned blood-red as they burned their essence, rushing toward the blood column with wild abandon. The thunderous sound echoed, but it was in vain; both figures were repelled again.

"Senior Brother, I'm sorry for disappointing you!" Luo Tian felt Zhang Ziping's relentless attacks outside and felt bitter.

"Ten steps... eight steps..." Yang Huanyu, with greedy eyes, approached Luo Tian and reached out to grab the Epoch Book. If he could grasp it, he would fully extract it within a moment.

"Don't worry; I won't kill you. I'll turn you into a Sky Corpse. Cultivating one Five-Element Body Sky Corpse, I'm sure I'll be the first!" Yang Huanyu's eyes held contempt as he spoke.

Seeing Yang Huanyu's pale hand wrapped in grey qi, Luo Tian felt despair and closed his eyes.

Just as Yang Huanyu's pale fingers were about to touch the golden Epoch Book, Luo Tian's back mark of the Nirvana Dragon Seal suddenly erupted. A clear dragon roar made despairing Luo Tian open his eyes.

Chapter 291: Dragon Emperor's Soul-Body Explosion

Chapter 291: Dragon Emperor's Soul-Body Explosion

"Roar..." The dragon roar echoed into people's ears, making them all shocked and gazing at the dazzling golden light within the blood column.

A dragon-shaped illusion, dozens of times larger than Long'er, rose from Luo Tian's body and appeared within the blood column. This golden light further illuminated the sky already lit by the Epoch Book, emitting an imperial aura.

"Is this a dragon?" Wei Mingxuan's heart was shocked, his face showing panic.

The three Yuanling Stage dragons of the major sects trembled and fell to the ground, their massive bodies like two suns. Their eyes, as bright as lightning, shook while staring at the golden dragon illusion.

"What level of dragon clan is this? It makes even Yuanling Stage dragons kneel and tremble!" All the cultivation disciples at the body-tempering and bone-devouring stages shivered, their faces showing fear. The aura of this dragon illusion made them feel an urge to kneel.

With eyes like lightning, the dragon's gaze swept over everyone, as if ruling the world. Under Luo Tian's surprised eyes, the dragon illusion shrank and transformed into a middle-aged man, appearing before Luo Tian within the blood column.

"Master Long Jian!" Zhang Ziping, already wounded, saw the middle-aged man within the blood column and showed joy. He had once sent Luo Tian into the Great An Forest and was fortunate enough to meet Long Jian. Seeing this man was Long Jian, how could he not be happy? To him, Long Jian was on par with his master Zhang Daotian!

"Kid, it's been a while. Your strength has increased, but you look so pitiful!" Long Jian smiled, looking at Luo Tian's grim face.

When he saw the Epoch Book now one-third exposed, Long Jian furrowed his brows. Then he looked at Yang Huanyu standing there and smiled slightly.

"Sorry, Master, I almost made Long'er die too!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly, and with Long Jian's arrival, he felt much better. Though his head still felt like it was splitting open, at least his body could move a little.

"Are you the Dragon Emperor? Long Jian?" Unexpectedly, Yang Huanyu's face showed no fear but instead asked.

"Hey, I didn't expect anyone on this continent to recognize me! Since I'm here, it means your plan has failed. You're not upset?" Long Jian's face showed amusement.

"Surely this isn't your true body, right? If you had come with your true self, just the aura alone would have been unbearable for me. But this soul-body is only at the Soul-Annihilation Stage, right? Though Soul-Annihilation Stage is strong, it's still difficult to break my array!" Yang Huanyu didn't dodge; he knew that with his Bone-Devouring Initial Stage, evading Long Jian was like a fool's dream.

"Indeed, this array is complex, but with me here, you won't get the book. Also, killing you will naturally break this array!" Long Jian's golden hand lightly pressed against Luo Tian's forehead.

Golden light spread, and the Epoch Book returned to Luo Tian's mind, but it still absorbed the external blood qi.

As the Epoch Book returned to his mind, the dense qi clouds outside suddenly exploded and scattered into rolling qi. Though it didn't reach the stage of raindrops, misty vapor filled the air.

The disciples from all major sects couldn't miss this opportunity and began absorbing the scattered qi in the sky.

"Damn it!" Yang Huanyu's face darkened as he watched the Epoch Book return to Luo Tian's mind. He had invested so much and was about to succeed, but this damned Dragon Emperor had stopped him.

"Then let's all go to the Sky Corpse Sect's lair! I'll see if this soul-body can still be arrogant there!" Yang Huanyu's hands moved, and he pressed one of the array corners.

At the moment Yang Huanyu's hand touched the corner, the person in the underground of the Western Regions' Sky Corpse Sect slowly opened his eyes. His withered fingers continuously carved in the air, and a powerful teleportation force emerged from this single finger.

At this moment, Long Jian was repairing Luo Tian's fractured mind. Though the Epoch Book had returned to his mind, the fractured mind still needed repair; with Luo Tian alone, it would take a long time.

When Yang Huanyu pressed his hand on the array corner, Long Jian's face turned pale. He had thought Yang Huanyu had no more tricks left but was surprised to find he could still activate this array. He turned back, a strong suction force hitting the three of them.

"Haha! Luo Tian, I saw the Sky Corpse Sect's lair; who can save you!" Yang Huanyu laughed madly, waiting for the teleportation array to open.

In an instant, Long Jian had no time to repair Luo Tian's mind. He knew if his soul-body and Luo Tian were transported to the Sky Corpse Sect's lair, what situation they would face. His soul-body's destruction wasn't a problem; he could waste some cultivation to reforge it.

But if Luo Tian died, the consequences would be severe—not only would Luo Tian die, but his son, Long'er, would also die. Not to mention Long'er's situation, Long Jian wouldn't let Luo Tian die.

In an instant, Long Jian burned all his cultivation and a drop of his soul-body's essence to create the strongest strike.

A golden dragon transformed into a sword, combining Long Jian's entire Soul-Annihilation Stage cultivation. It exploded within the blood column with a thunderous roar.

"Boom..." The sound echoed, as if the sky itself had been torn apart. Everyone around quickly activated their cultivation to protect their ears from the explosion's sound.

The Yuanling Stage masters also stood in front of their disciples to block the residual power of this earth-shattering explosion.

It lasted for a quarter of a minute, and the entire array was reduced to ruins. People trembled as they looked at the barren ground; even the previous blood qi had been scattered by this powerful explosion.

"What a strong attack from a Soul-Annihilation Stage master! I feel it's several times stronger than the six-star elixir's thunderstorm!" A disciple from the Five Elements Sect trembled, and if not for a companion at the bone-devouring stage supporting him, he would have collapsed.

Wei Mingxuan and other major sect masters also showed awe; they were amazed at how a Soul-Annihilation Stage master's all-out attack could cause massive casualties to a sect, even one that couldn't withstand such a terrifying explosion.

Chapter 292: Descent

Chapter 292: Descent

The Northern Region's people stared in fear at the barren ground, and for a moment, the scene was deathly quiet, only hearing people's heavy breathing.

"Damn it! Where is Luo Tian!" Zhang Ziping felt a sense of helplessness.

Not only was Zhang Ziping growling, but the Sky Corpse Sect's warriors also trembled. Their Young Master Yang Huanyu had disappeared in this Soul-Annihilation Stage master's all-out attack.

"Damn it!" The leader of the Yuanling Peak elder looked grim; he knew Yang Huanyu's status in the Sky Corpse Sect was far superior to his own Yuanling Peak. If Yang Huanyu met misfortune, they wouldn't fare well either.

At this moment, both sides had no desire to confront each other anymore, especially the Five Elements Sect. Their faces were grim.

Thunderclap Sect and Hundred Forge Sect also looked grim; they could clearly sense the massive secret in the golden book on Luo Tian's forehead. If the Sky Corpse Sect obtained it, they would become even stronger.

"Let's go!" The Sky Corpse Sect's Yuanling Peak elder coldly snorted. He urgently needed to know Yang Huanyu's fate, and the way to find out was to return to their Northern Region base and check if Yang Huanyu's life sign still existed.

"Want to run?" The Thunderclap Sect master instantly flew in front of the black-cloaked elder, throwing a punch. This single punch was equivalent to an S-grade martial art!

"Old man wants to leave! No one can stop me!" The elder seemed mad, placing a Yuanling Mid-Stage corpse in front of him to block the Thunderclap Sect master's form, then fleeing into the distance without even caring if the remaining Sky Corpse Sect members could escape.

"Alas..." The Thunderclap Sect master's face showed a hint of helplessness; he knew this Yuanling Peak elder was determined to flee, and with their current strength, it would be difficult to stop him.

Other first-tier sect masters also thought the same and turned their eyes toward the remaining Sky Corpse Sect members, their faces showing a grim expression: "No one will escape!"

Besides the Five Elements Sect members, others rushed toward the remaining Sky Corpse Sect disciples.

The remaining disciples saw the Yuanling Stage elder flee and some were scared out of their wits, fleeing in all directions. In this chaos, everyone took care of themselves, running as far as they could.

The sect disciples and masters couldn't miss this opportunity and charged at the remaining Sky Corpse Sect members like they had been injected with energy. The battlefield reignited, but now the allied forces had a clear advantage, crushing the remaining Sky Corpse Sect disciples.

Even the Sky Corpse Sect's Yuanling Stage masters fled in all directions, and major sects' Yuanling Stage masters paired up to chase the fleeing Sky Corpse Sect disciples.

Zhang Ziping, Tian Bo, and Wei Mingxuan didn't bother with the fleeing Sky Corpse Sect disciples. They moved swiftly toward the Five Elements Sect, desperately wanting to know if Luo Tian was still alive.

This battle ended here; the major sects had paid a heavy price with several thousand disciples and the lives of several Yuanling Stage masters, finally breaking up the Sky Corpse Sect in the Northern Region. Only a few Yuanling Stage masters escaped.

But Luo Tian was completely unaware of these events; during the explosion, a displacement force formed on his body. This feeling was familiar to him. He knew that after Long Jian's all-out attack, he didn't know if it could disrupt this displacement force or to what extent. He could only wait for the judgment.

If he was displaced to the Sky Corpse Sect's lair, he would definitely die. If displaced elsewhere, he might have a chance of survival!

How long it had been, Luo Tian felt dizzy. He only knew he was constantly moving through space with immense pressure, making it impossible for him to move.

He secretly thanked Long Jian for protecting him with his soul-body at the last moment, but he also sighed at the power of the Soul-Annihilation Stage. That was the strongest attack he had ever seen. If not for the blood array blocking it, none of the bone-devouring stage masters in the battlefield would have survived. Even Yuanling Stage masters would have been severely injured.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was lost in thought, the surroundings trembled, making him sigh and secretly pray he wouldn't end up in the Sky Corpse Sect's lair.

"Crash..." A weak body fell from high above, landing heavily on the ground and spitting out blood.

Though Luo Tian was protected by Long Jian during the explosion, the residual shockwave still injured him. Falling from high above was like adding insult to injury.

But he was fortunate it wasn't too high; otherwise, he might have died from the fall.

Luo Tian stood up immediately after landing, not even wiping the blood on his lips. He cautiously looked around and sighed in relief, secretly thinking he was lucky not to have fallen into the Sky Corpse Sect's lair.

He stood up and noticed two people staring at him as if he were a monster. Luo Tian became cautious again, unsure of where he was. But after sensing their cultivation levels, he relaxed; they were only at the body-tempering third stage. Though currently sealed to body-tempering ninth stage and injured, he wasn't someone who could be bullied by two body-tempering third-stage individuals.

"Brothers, what's your name?" Luo Tian placed two pills into his mouth and asked.

"You're a human or a ghost!" One middle-aged man trembled, asking with fear in his eyes.

The other middle-aged man also showed a hint of fear but, considering they were at the body-tempering third stage and top-tier in this area, he felt reassured.

"Huh?" Luo Tian was puzzled by their fear and looked at himself, then suddenly realized.

At this moment, Luo Tian could no longer be described as "disheveled." His body was stained with blood, only two bright eyes visible. To say he wasn't scary would be something he wouldn't believe himself.

He showed a bitter smile, revealing his white teeth; this smile made the two middle-aged men even more afraid. But one of them had a bit more courage, grabbing his companion who wanted to run and waiting for Luo Tian's reply.

"Brothers, don't be afraid! I'm a human! But... well, something's wrong. Can you tell me where this is?" Luo Tian forced his remaining water attribute qi into a handful of water, washing his face and revealing his young, handsome face.

Chapter 293: Eastern Region

Chapter 293: Eastern Region

"You're a cultivator?" The middle-aged man saw the water in Luo Tian's hand and showed great surprise. He clearly had experience, knowing that cultivators existed.

"Yes! I am a cultivator!" Luo Tian smiled, clearly pleased with the middle-aged man's words.

"Then how did you end up here? And why are you covered in blood!" The two middle-aged men showed a hint of hostility, recalling the rules of this place. Clearly, Luo Tian's injury was evident.

"Ah... that blood!" Luo Tian couldn't explain it well, secretly annoyed; he just wanted to know where this was, but the middle-aged man had questioned him for so long. He felt annoyed and needed a place to recover his strength, then return to the Northern Region to check on how things were there and ease his brothers' worries.

"Alright, since you're a cultivator, no more talk. Hand over anything valuable on your body; this place is under our control." The other middle-aged man also grew bolder.

"Huh?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion; seeing the two middle-aged men's fierce eyes, he didn't know where he was. This was his first time seeing someone so openly rob another.
