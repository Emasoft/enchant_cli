“Three brothers, do you not know where we are? Which direction leads to a teleportation array?” Luo Tian addressed the three men.

“Do you not know where we are?”

“You must be a deserter from Btian City!” one of the youths, older in appearance, spoke up, scrutinizing Luo Tian with a critical gaze. Though Luo Tian suppressed his aura, he was undeniably a ghost cultivator, and the chill of his presence made the three men wary.

“I’m merely lost,” Luo Tian shook his head. Though these three were no match for him, he remained cautious.

“Lying,” the youth scoffed. “We’ve seen countless deserters here. Your expression gives you away.”

“Head southward, there’s a Tianhun City with a teleportation array. Hurry along!” the youth pointed in a direction.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with interest. He clasped his fists in greeting: “Three brothers, is there something troubling you? If so, I can assist.”

“You must be a prodigy from some sect. Have you heard of Chihyan? We seek this herb!”

“Chihyan?” Luo Tian’s gaze sharpened. As a cultivator of elixirs, he knew its value—a celestial treasure shaped like fire, with yang properties but growing in the most shadowed places.

“An invaluable item,” Luo Tian mused, observing the three. Their bodies showed no signs of illness.

“We seek it for another,” the youth explained. “We reside in Tianhun City. Thirty years ago, a physician known as Ruhongyu arrived and opened an apothecary to heal the people.”

“Master Ruhongyu is a true benevolence,” the youth added. “But recently, he offended Tianhun City’s lord. The city lord’s son fell ill, and Ruhongyu failed to cure him, inciting the lord’s wrath. He injured Master Ruhongyu and triggered his old ailments.”

“Indeed, the city lord’s son was born with a foolish mind. Even an immortal wouldn’t have helped,” the youths chimed in, their voices tinged with sorrow.

“Hmph. A healer’s skill and a relapse of old wounds,” Luo Tian frowned, then murmured: “What is Master Ruhongyu’s name? What does he look like?”

“Ruhongyu. Ask in Tianhun City, and you’ll find him,” the youth replied with reverence.

“Ruhongyu!” Luo Tian’s mind jolted. That name was deeply familiar to him.

“What level is the Tianhun City Lord?” Luo Tian asked softly, his voice so low it chilled the air, making the three men shiver.

“True Immortal peak,” the eldest youth answered, his gaze now wary of Luo Tian.

“Do you have news about Chihyan?” Luo Tian pressed, his eyes gleaming with intensity that made the three men avert their gazes.

“An overlord! Definitely an overlord!” the youths trembled. They hadn’t expected to meet such a power here.

“Correct. Head west three million miles, there’s a Broken Soul Mountain where a Duan Hun Daoist dwells. It’s said he possesses Chihyan. We intend to try our luck!” the youth sighed.

“Lead the way,” Luo Tian swept his sleeve, seized the three with a hand, and soared into the sky toward the direction of Broken Soul Mountain. Three million miles was naught to Luo Tian, and within moments, a gray mountain loomed in his sight.

A weathered temple stood atop the mountain. An old Daoist, clad in tattered robes, sat cross-legged. As Luo Tian arrived at the summit, the old man’s eyes snapped open, swirling with gray mist.

“Duan Hun Daoist, come forth!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed across the heavens, making the old man frown.

Chapter 2228: Duan Hun Daoist

Duan Hun Daoist, draped in gray robes, ruled Broken Soul Mountain. His strength was formidable; the region’s sparse population made him untouchable, even feared by Tianhun City’s lord, Chen Tiantian. Tianhun City was a major metropolis near the Hell Gate, with ties to Btian City. Chen Tiantian’s power was True Immortal peak, and his fear of Duan Hun Daoist suggested the latter’s might rivaled his.

In a gray hall, hundreds of infants cried bitterly. Duan Hun Daoist sat cross-legged in his robes, eyes gleaming with a sly smile. He exhaled sharply, drawing the infants’ souls into his mouth, their vitality vanishing as they crumbled to bones.

“Another few thousand and my Broken Soul Art will be complete!” Duan Hun Daoist mused, his eyes flickering with gray.

“Duan Hun Daoist, come forth!” As he mused, a thunderous voice echoed across Broken Soul Mountain. Duan Hun Daoist started.

“I didn’t sense anyone approaching?” He frowned, then leapt from the hall. Four figures appeared before him—three True Immortal initiates ignored, but his gaze locked on Luo Tian, the sword-bearing youth.

“Fine blade!” Duan Hun Daoist mused. “Powerful soul!”

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, sensing Duan Hun Daoist’s unstable aura. Yet he dismissed it, focusing on his mission.

“Friend, what brings you to my mountain?” Duan Hun Daoist smiled, eyes glinting with greed. “I’ve heard you seek Chihyan.”

“Indeed,” Luo Tian replied. “I’ll pay any price for it.”

The youths exchanged glances, puzzled. Why did this youth seek Chihyan? He’d overheard their tale of Ruhongyu and now demanded it. Was he connected to the physician?

“Master Duan Hun is eccentric,” one youth whispered to Luo Tian. “His domain spans miles; none dare enter. It’s said he cultivates a forbidden art, feeding on souls to enhance his power.”

Luo Tian understood now why Duan Hun Daoist’s soul was unstable. He nodded, then muttered: “If he refuses, I’ll have no choice.”

“Hah! Chihyan is mine. Join me in my hall, and I’ll gift it to you!” Duan Hun Daoist laughed.

“No, I’ll wait here. I need Chihyan to save my friend’s life. When their fate is secured, I’ll return to thank you,” Luo Tian smiled, cautious yet confident.

“Then what is your name?” Duan Hun Daoist asked, his greed palpable. “I’ll grant you a moment to drink tea.”

“Luo Tian,” he replied, noting the old man’s greed. He sighed inwardly.

“Come with me, Master Luo Tian,” Duan Hun Daoist beamed, inviting him toward the mountain. Luo Tian smirked; if not for Chihyan’s presence, he’d have no patience for this charade.

They entered the main hall. The space was gray, littered with bones and a mountain of skeletal remains glowing faintly.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened. The tiny bones were those of children—Duan Hun Daoist’s cruelty had stirred his wrath.

Luo Tian, who’d killed many, never harmed children. Even in eradication, he spared infants.

“Clang!” The hall’s door slammed shut. Duan Hun Daoist smiled confidently.

“Master Luo Tian, what do you think of my hall? These bones are those I’ve slain!” He gestured to a skeleton. “This one was a merchant’s daughter, 18 when I took her soul.”

“This one was a True Immortal peak—my trophy!” Duan Hun Daoist continued.

“I care not for your preferences. Show me Chihyan,” Luo Tian said, his voice calm but his soul seething.

“Your life!” Duan Hun Daoist raised a hand, unleashing a crimson flame that coalesced into Chihyan.

“Will you honor your promise?” Duan Hun Daoist asked, smiling.

“It’s yours,” Luo Tian smiled. “But first—your life.”

“Die, and you’ll be my collection!” Duan Hun Daoist advanced, chains of gray soul energy lashing toward Luo Tian.

“Too weak,” Luo Tian frowned. The chains shattered, and he drew Longyuan, slicing through Duan Hun Daoist’s defenses.

“Hah! Still stubborn!” Duan Hun Daoist laughed, drawing a gray sword. But as he lunged, the chains snapped.

“Impossible!” Duan Hun Daoist gasped. His soul energy was no match for Luo Tian’s mastery.

“Don’t play with me,” Luo Tian warned, his blade cleaving through Duan Hun Daoist’s defenses.

Chapter 2229: Meeting Ruhongyu

Above Broken Soul Mountain, three youths stood, eyes alight. They hadn’t expected such success—Duan Hun Daoist was notorious.

“Who is this youth? Perhaps he once saved Master Ruhongyu!” they whispered, waiting.

In the hall, Luo Tian’s blade clashed with Duan Hun Daoist’s. The clash shattered the hall, sending debris flying.

“Whoa!” The youths recoiled as the battle raged. Luo Tian, like a god descending, wielded Longyuan with relentless strikes, each slicing through Duan Hun Daoist’s defenses.

“Why fight? He’s overpowered!” they murmured, watching Luo Tian’s relentless assault.

“Duan Hun Art!” Duan Hun Daoist roared, summoning a gray hand to crush Luo Tian. But Luo Tian countered with a soul blade, shattering the attack.

“Too weak,” Luo Tian scoffed. Duan Hun Daoist’s soul arts were no match for his mastery.

The battle raged, and Duan Hun Daoist faltered. His attacks were futile against Luo Tian’s soul prowess.

“Give me Chihyan, and I’ll leave,” Duan Hun Daoist pleaded, desperation in his voice.

“End it,” Luo Tian said. With a step, he vanished and reappeared behind Duan Hun Daoist, Longyuan piercing his heart.

“Pf!” Blood spewed. Duan Hun Daoist’s soul escaped, fleeing into the distance.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian noted the rare sight of a soul separating from its body. He’d never seen such in the heavens.

“I’m leaving,” Duan Hun Daoist declared, stunned by Luo Tian’s strength.

“Flee? No soul to devour?” Luo Tian grabbed him, his power freezing the fleeing soul.

Luo Tian’s grip shattered Duan Hun Daoist’s soul, scattering it into the air. The youths gasped as Luo Tian seized Duan Hun Daoist’s ring.

“Nine-color fire dragons!” Luo Tian summoned, incinerating Broken Soul Mountain. “Let’s go,” he told the youths, guiding them toward Tianhun City.

An hour later, they arrived. Tianhun City was a metropolis backed by the ninth-ranked sect Nine Abyss Island, with ties to Btian City. If Btian fell, it would retreat here.

The city’s walls loomed high. Entering Tianhun City, the ghostly aura vanished; the sky turned blue, a stark contrast to the outside.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian sighed. It was the first time in years he’d seen such clear skies, yet his ghostly aura made him uneasy.

The streets bustled with people. Luo Tian and the youths went unnoticed.

“Where does Ruhongyu live?” Luo Tian asked, smiling. He’d learned the youths’ names: Sikong Le (eldest), Sikong Bo (middle), and Sikong Tong (youngest). They were over two hundred, True Immortal initiates. Their family had once been powerful but declined over generations.

They’d met Ruhongyu when he saved them from injury, earning his respect. Many in Tianhun City revered him.

Sikong Le led Luo Tian to Ruhongyu’s residence. The courtyard was quiet, but outside it teemed with people.

“Ruhongyu! You never asked for payment before. Treat my brother!” a man shouted.

“If you don’t heal him, I’ll break your legs!” others jeered. Luo Tian’s expression darkened.

Sikong Le pushed through the crowd, leading Luo Tian into the courtyard. It was in disarray: a youth lay on the ground, bloodied; another raged, flanked by two True Immortal mid-level warriors.

“Luo Tian!” Ruhongyu recognized him, his face pale with shock and joy. But Luo Tian’s gaze sharpened at Ruhongyu’s condition.

“Who is he?” Luo Tian asked Sikong Le, pointing at the yelling youth.

“Tianhun City’s Ming clan heir, Ming Ba. The one on the ground is his brother, Ming Jue,” Sikong Le replied.

“Indeed, I am,” Ming Ba sneered, eyeing Luo Tian’s power. “This is Tianhun City; our clan holds sway.”

“Crack!” Luo Tian’s hand closed around Ming Ba’s throat. “Can I kill him?” he asked Ruhongyu, knowing his compassion.

“Your current level?” Ruhongyu asked, their eyes meeting. He sensed Luo Tian’s True Immortal peak strength.

“Can kill a True Immortal peak,” Luo Tian replied. The crowd gasped.

“This man claims to slay a True Immortal peak with his level?” they murmured.

“Do as you wish,” Ruhongyu said, entering his room. Luo Tian tossed Duan Hun Daoist’s ring to him.

“Forgive me,” Ruhongyu smiled, entering the room.

Chapter 2230: Explosion

Luo Tian watched Ruhongyu vanish, gripping Ming Ba. “What are you doing? I—” Ming Ba’s words were cut short as Luo Tian crushed his throat.

The sound of a snap echoed. Luo Tian discarded Ming Ba, who was lifeless.

“Killed! He’s truly dead!” the crowd murmured, staring at Ming Ba’s corpse.

“Still faking death?” Luo Tian glared at the bloodied Ming Jue, stomping toward him.

“Dare to die?” Luo Tian’s foot met Ming Jue’s chest. A streak of light shot from the crowd toward him.

“Hmph, so soon?” Luo Tian smirked, seizing the light. A golden sword materialized, its hum piercing.

At the same time, a man appeared before Luo Tian. His face was grim—Ming Tao, Tianhun City’s second-in-command and a loyal of the city lord.

“Mid-level divine artifact?” Luo Tian scoffed. Even a True Immortal peak’s sword was weak against him.

As he mocked, Ming Jue rose from the ground, wiping blood. His eyes widened in fear.

“Father! He killed my brother!” Ming Jue cried, seeing Luo Tian as a monster.

“I know!” Ming Tao seethed. His sword refused to move, and he realized Luo Tian’s sword mastery surpassed his.

“Sword isn’t used this way!” Luo Tian gripped the sword, striking Ming Tao. The impact sent him flying.

“Buzz…” The sword spun around Luo Tian before trembling. It feared Longyuan, one of the seven evil swords.

Luo Tian pointed, and the sword returned to Ming Tao. “Damn! That blade isn’t ordinary!” Ming Tao cursed, understanding Luo Tian’s superiority.

But it was too late. The sword flew back, and Ming Tao rolled to evade. A scream echoed as the blade pierced his buttocks.

“Huh?” The crowd’s jaws dropped. They gaped at Luo Tian, awed by his precision.

“Is he…?” they whispered, stepping back.

Luo Tian was stunned. “Hmph,” he blushed at their stares.

As he hesitated, Ming Tao yanked the sword free. Blood dripped as he glared at Luo Tian.

“I’ll fight you!” Ming Tao lunged, fueled by pain and humiliation. His punch cracked the air.

“Apologies,” Luo Tian said, striking back. The clash sent Ming Tao flying again.

“Too strong! No chance!” the crowd murmured, awed.

Ming Tao’s arm shattered, but his pain remained. “This youth is terrifying!” he thought.

“Sorry, I must kill you,” Luo Tian approached.

“Sword brother, mercy!” Ming Tao pleaded, fear in his eyes.

“Boom!” Luo Tian’s foot crushed Ming Tao’s skull. Blood splattered the ground.

“Another death! Who is this youth?” they gasped, staring at Luo Tian.

“But he deserved it. Who dared harass Master Ruhongyu?” they whispered, respecting Luo Tian.

“Clean up,” he ordered, kicking the sword. He approached Ruhongyu’s room.

The door opened to a typical apothecary, its scent of herbs filling the air. Ruhongyu sat pale, a black pot on fire.

“Are you alright?” Luo Tian asked.

“Nothing serious. Rest and take medicine,” Ruhongyu smiled, adding firewood.

“How did you get so hurt? Have you been here all this time?” Luo Tian pressed.

“Not sure where to go. I searched but found no one. I stayed here,” Ruhongyu replied.

“You’ve done well. Any plans?” Ruhongyu smiled, sipping his medicine.

“Join me. I’ve found many, but not your parents. Only the Fire Domain’s master,” Luo Tian said.

“After resolving some matters, I’ll leave,” Ruhongyu smiled, his strength stabilizing.

“True Immortal peak?” Luo Tian mused. Ruhongyu’s strength should’ve matched a True Immortal peak, yet he’d been so wounded. But Luo Tian didn’t press.

They exited the room. The crowd had grown, including city guards.

“Master Ruhongyu!” Sikong Le greeted, bowing respectfully.

“I must leave. Take care,” Ruhongyu said, offering the courtyard as their reward.

“Master Ruhongyu, the city lord requests your presence. Come with us,” a guard ordered.

“And you too,” the leader glared at Luo Tian.

“Hah! No need to ask. I’ll go myself,” Ruhongyu smiled, turning to Luo Tian: “Brother Luo, thank you.”

“Hah! Brothers, no problem!” Luo Tian smiled, facing the guard.
