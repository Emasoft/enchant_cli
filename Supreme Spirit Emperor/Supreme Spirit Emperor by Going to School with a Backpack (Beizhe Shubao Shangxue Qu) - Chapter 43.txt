Two individuals did not hesitate to expend their vital energy. They felt that the anomaly in the Locking Spirit Tower was clearly connected to themselves and the group of black-cloaked figures. Although the elixirs for restoring vitality were somewhat precious here, compared to the opportunities within this hidden domain, they still fell short.

They moved with the speed of lightning, covering nearly a hundred miles in just half a day.

"Let's part ways here!" Leng Qiuchan halted, her demeanor returning to its icy coldness as she spoke with a voice like frost.

"Ah, be careful. Next time don't let me catch you!" Luo Tian ignored Leng Qiuchan's chill and made a jest, his hands producing several jade vials. Without resistance from Leng Qiuchan, he forcefully shoved them into her hands—these were the elixirs given to Luo Tian by Lu Kunpeng before his departure.

"Keep it yourself; I don't need it!" Leng Qiuchan refused, sensing the elixirs were extraordinary.

Though she had her own elixirs, compared to Lu Kunpeng's, they were still lacking. Yet she knew the value of elixirs within this hidden domain; an extra pill could sometimes mean another life.

"Such a bother! Take it, it's as simple for me as eating!" Luo Tian chuckled.

With his current alchemical skills and the countless spiritual herbs stored in his ring, producing elixirs was merely a matter of time.

Leng Qiuchan's icy gaze shifted slightly, her voice still cold: "Remember, your life is mine! One day I'll kill you!"

After speaking, she did not dawdle further, storing the elixirs and vanishing in a flash toward the Locking Spirit Tower.

Watching her receding figure, Luo Tian smiled and sat on the ground, confirming Leng Qiuchan had truly departed. His eyes gleamed with fierce battle intent: "It's time to move. Let me see what strange secrets this Locking Spirit Tower holds!"

...

The tower's towering form stood at the center of the hidden domain, visible to all creatures within. Yet no one had ever entered its depths, unaware of what lay inside.

At this moment, three groups of young people stood beneath the tower's imposing height, their faces marked by exhaustion. The three groups eyed each other with mutual hostility.

These three groups were led by Chen Changsheng and his two elder brothers. Though they eyed each other with hostility, both Chen Changsheng and Tu Yu Zheng's eyes carried concern.

Especially Tu Yu Zheng, his mind in turmoil—because their group was missing one person. He knew the identity of the absent individual, and if anything happened to them, he was certain those three behind would not hesitate to kill him.

Thinking of this, Tu Yu Zheng's face was filled with anxiety, regretting having allowed that ancestor to enter.

The three black-cloaked figures behind Tu Yu Zheng, though masked, also bore worry in their eyes. Their cold gazes swept over the other two groups; to them, only these people could threaten her. If that person truly met misfortune, the three would immediately attack them.

Chapter 207: Before the Tower

Chapter 207: Before the Tower

"Ah...
The wind stirred.

Under Tu Yu Zheng's surprised gaze, a black-cloaked silhouette appeared in the group's view.

Seeing the arrival, Tu Yu Zheng and his three black-cloaked youths sighed in relief. Tu Yu Zheng smiled: "Miss Leng, was your journey smooth?"

"Fairly well."
Leng Qiuchan's gaze swept over everyone coldly, nodding to the three black-cloaked youths before joining Tu Yu Zheng's group.

"Alright, now that everyone is here, shouldn't we enter?" Pang Haoran's face bore impatience as he addressed the group.

Previously, the three groups had avoided being the first to enter due to mutual distrust, agreeing to wait until all were gathered. Now that Leng Qiuchan had arrived after two days, Pang Haoran would have entered long ago if not for his fear of Tu Yu Zheng's strength.

"We still have one person missing!" Chen Changsheng spoke softly, drawing everyone's attention to himself.

At this moment, Chen Changsheng's complexion was clearly poor; people could sense his vital energy had nearly run out.

"Hmph, what use is there in waiting for that useless one? I can't waste time on a failure!" Pang Haoran spoke coldly, his gaze filled with disdain as he looked at Chen Changsheng.

Chen Changsheng's group was clearly the weakest now, missing a member and even Chen Changsheng himself lacked vitality. If not for fearing the cost of eliminating them, Pang Haoran would have already attacked.

"You!" Chen Changsheng's face darkened.

"Perhaps that failure is already dead at the hands of those black-cloaked figures!" Ying Hongtu spoke coldly, looking at Chen Changsheng with a provoking expression. Just like hating Luo Tian, he also despised Chen Changsheng; now that there was an opportunity to belittle him, how could he miss it?

Tu Yu Zheng remained calm, watching the two groups bicker without speaking. He merely observed with his four black-cloaked figures.

"Senior Brother, let's enter first. Why waste time here?" Pang Haoran ignored Chen Changsheng's fury, addressing Tu Yu Zheng. At this point, Chen Changsheng's group no longer posed much threat.

Hearing Pang Haoran's words, Tu Yu Zheng pondered briefly before nodding slightly. He also did not wish to waste time waiting for Luo Tian.

Seeing the two ignoring them, Chen Changsheng's face darkened; even his three companions looked sullen. Clearly, these people had disregarded them, prompting some blame toward Chen Changsheng for bringing Luo Tian, the so-called failure.

As Chen Changsheng's group fumed, Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran had already decided to enter the Locking Spirit Tower.

"You!" Chen Changsheng gritted his teeth, but if not for his depleted vitality, he would have stopped them. Yet the situation was clear: one group of Pang Haoran alone was more than he could handle now, let alone the stronger Tu Yu Zheng.

"Senior Brother, we'll go first!" Pang Haoran and Tu Yu Zheng led their group forward, striding toward the Locking Spirit Tower and vanishing before Chen Changsheng's eyes.

Chen Changsheng's face darkened as ten people walked past him, strutting into the Locking Spirit Tower. His expression was at its blackest.

"Senior Brother Changsheng, what should we do now?" Jing Boren and the other two asked in unison, their eyes carrying reproach.

Clearly, they believed that if they had replaced Luo Tian earlier, this situation would not have occurred.

"I said it before—why bring a burden of body refinement eighth level?"

"Indeed, let's go in then. Senior Brother Changsheng should first take the elixirs to restore his vitality, giving us four a chance. If we wait for that failure, we might not even get to speak before it's too late!" Chai Xiangming and Jing Boren urged.

Feng Tianxiong remained silent, standing coldly without speaking. Yet his meaning was clear—he did not oppose their proposal. Earlier, with so many people around, they had restrained themselves; now that only the four of them remained, they could speak without hesitation.

Wait a moment—I'll restore my vitality first," Chen Changsheng said, his face dark as he took out an elixir from his storage pouch and placed it in his mouth, beginning to recover. He planned to enter the Locking Spirit Tower once he regained his vitality; after all, he could not afford to alienate the three by waiting for Luo Tian. That would only hurt their hearts.

Time passed swiftly; Chen Changsheng opened his eyes, gazing into the distance. Not seeing Luo Tian's figure, he spoke softly: "Let's go!"

Hearing Chen Changsheng's words, the three men's faces lit up. The four of them flashed forward into the Locking Spirit Tower.

Just as the four entered the tower, wind stirred again; Luo Tian's figure appeared at the entrance. Seeing the empty tower mouth, he knew others had already entered.

Luo Tian did not rush in immediately but stood at the entrance, observing carefully. A wave of unease surged within him; his storage ring's Soul-Subduing Cauldron emitted a continuous hum.

"Boom..." The massive cauldron fell to the ground with a heavy sound.

As it landed, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron vanished from its place, crashing into the Locking Spirit Tower with a thunderous hum that made Luo Tian's ears ring. He could not hear anything else.

Yet Luo Tian felt the cauldron as if greeting an old friend.

At the same time, after being struck by the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, the Locking Spirit Tower responded with a burst of light forming a dragon of radiance, projecting into the cauldron.

"Unexpectedly, I met the Soul-Subduing Cauldron in my final moments!" A voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

As the voice spoke, a figure of an old man seemed to materialize above the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

Recognizing this voice, Luo Tian was certain it was the same one he had heard when first entering the hidden domain.

"Please, elder, enlighten me!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully; he could sense this was merely a projection and held no attack power.

"The Soul-Subduing Cauldron and the Locking Spirit Tower are both ancient treasures! Acquiring one is already your fortune. However, obtaining the Locking Spirit Tower now poses great difficulty for you!" The spectral elder spoke.

"Over time, and with my demise, these descendants learned of my identity as the one who killed their ancestors. They also discovered this was merely a hidden domain. These people have long been patient, generation after generation, and now they've finally erupted!" The spectral elder continued.

"Then, elder, do you have no way to stop them?" Luo Tian asked solemnly, recalling the massacred tribes and feeling uneasy.

"There is none. I am no longer even a residual soul; I have no attack power at all. If not for the Soul-Subduing Cauldron and Locking Spirit Tower's resonance, which activated a fragment of my spirit left within the tower, I would not be speaking to you now!" The elder spoke calmly.

"Then, elder, do you have any way to resolve this?" Luo Tian asked again.

"That depends on your own efforts. To obtain my inheritance and treasures, you must reach the tower's summit! There are no other methods. My time is nearly up; goodbye, young ones!"

The elder's words ended, and the light screen faded.

Luo Tian watched the fading figure of the elder and cursed: "What's the point of coming out? You didn't even have the heart to kill your enemies' descendants, nor did you tell me how to destroy them! You're giving me trouble!"

But after cursing twice, he stopped. He knew the elder had likely died completely; no one could regenerate a residual soul after reaching the spirit-attainment realm.

After some frustration, Luo Tian strode into the Locking Spirit Tower.

As he entered, he felt a strong surge of vital energy; the first level of the Locking Spirit Tower was in chaos.

Several beasts wreathed in black energy were constantly attacking, the group of Chen Changsheng and Tu Yu Zheng's ten people.

Luo Tian glanced at the battlefield; these people were fighting in groups of two or three against a beast, with five beasts total—each radiating black energy.

Luo Tian guessed these were the tribe's guardian beasts, but now they seemed to have lost their minds, attacking those who surrounded them. If not for losing their senses, these people would have no chance to fight back; these beasts were all at the bone-attainment initial stage.

Though these people were prodigies, they could only endure for a short time against bone-attainment beasts. To defeat them was difficult! Even if two or three joined forces, it was still arduous.

Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming were currently fighting a bear-shaped beast, the sound of collisions echoing around them.

Luo Tian naturally noticed Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming's battle with the bear, which seemed more ferocious than the other beasts. Though Chen Changsheng had taken elixirs, this bear's immense strength pushed them back step by step.

Others like Leng Qiuchan fared better, their beasts not as fierce as the bear. Yet they could only maintain a balance; remember, there was no vital energy supply here. The longer the battle lasted, the more disadvantageous it became for them.

"Lu Tian!" When Luo Tian entered the first level of the tower, everyone noticed his arrival. Except for Leng Qiuchan and Chen Changsheng, no one paid him any attention; in their view, his presence was merely a drop in the bucket.

Chen Changsheng's face lit up with relief but he paused for a moment as the bear's palm, as large as a basin, struck Chen Changsheng's shoulder.

Then, Chen Changsheng was spitting blood and flew backward, his shoulder emitting a crackling sound.

Chen Changsheng's fall left Chai Xiangming in panic; without Chen Changsheng's distraction, he could not match the bear. Though his martial arts were constantly unleashed and a fiery long sword in his hand continuously slashed at the bear, these terrifying attacks only added several wounds to the bear. They could not kill it, but instead incited its ferocity.

"Roar..." The bear let out a thunderous roar, eyes blood-red, rushing toward Chai Xiangming.

Chai Xiangming dodged with his body's agility, cursing inwardly; he could feel this mad bear's attacks—each one, if hit, would leave him injured even if he survived.

Luo Tian flashed to Chen Changsheng's side, finding him unharmed except for a broken arm. He sighed inwardly at Chen Changsheng's miraculous ability to deflect the blow. If it were anyone else, they would have been severely injured. He placed an elixir in Chen Changsheng's mouth.

"Sorry, I didn't wait for you!" Chen Changsheng apologized, his eyes carrying a hint of guilt but then turned to surprise as he felt the elixir's effects. His broken bones were rapidly healing, and he would recover within a quarter of an hour.

"It's fine!" Luo Tian replied calmly, giving Chen Changsheng a reassuring glance.

"Kid, why are you still lingering? Come help!" Chai Xiangming's angry voice echoed, dodging the bear's attack with a look of impatience.

Luo Tian saw Chai Xiangming's plight and smiled slightly; he knew now was not the time to dwell on Chai Xiangming's previous mockery. His spear, "Rending Heaven," was in his hand; he moved swiftly toward the bear.

Though Chai Xiangming had called Luo Tian, he hadn't truly expected much from him. He just hoped Luo Tian could hold off a few blows to buy himself time, which would be enough. But he hadn't expected Luo Tian to actively attack the bear.

"Insane!" Chai Xiangming mentally cursed Luo Tian as a fool, while secretly praying Chen Changsheng would recover quickly or Jing Boren and the others could finish off that leopard.

But immediately after, Chai Xiangming's mouth gaped open in disbelief; a flash of cold light struck the bear's tough hide.

"Roar..." A mournful sound echoed, and the spear was deeply embedded in the bear's chest.

Chai Xiangming rubbed his eyes, disbelievingly looking at Luo Tian; Chen Changsheng also saw Luo Tian's strike, his face showing joy.

Luo Tian ignored Chai Xiangming and Chen Changsheng's shock, pulling out the spear. A stream of blood gushed from the bear's chest.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly; this bear's defense was no less formidable than its attack, but he had no intention of killing it. He held no hostility toward beasts and hoped to find a way to awaken these creatures.

Chapter 209: Shock

Others also noticed the change in Luo Tian's situation, their expressions filled with surprise. Especially Ying Hongtu, his face showed intense resentment; he hadn't expected that even though Luo Tian was only at body refinement eighth level, his strength was still so formidable.

"Boom..." In a moment's hesitation, Ying Hongtu's thigh was bitten by a wolf-shaped beast attacking him and Pang Haoran.

Ying Hongtu cried out in pain, no longer focusing on attacking the gray wolf.

Others were also shocked by Luo Tian's strength, but their attacks intensified. However, the most comfortable among them were Tu Yu Zheng and his group; Leng Qiuchan and three other black-cloaked youths had, unknown when, acquired flutes. Strange notes were emitted from their mouths.

Strangely, the beasts that had lost their minds slowed down after hearing these strange notes. Tu Yu Zheng could completely control them, and they grew bolder in battle.

Luo Tian ignored the others' situation; the bear had already turned its fierce gaze toward him.

"Be careful!" Chen Changsheng, who had just recovered somewhat, saw the black bear's palm strike Luo Tian and shouted in warning.

Chai Xiangming also saw the bear's attack, sensing its terrifying aura. He guessed that Luo Tian had only wounded the bear because of his spear's sharpness; a body refinement eighth level Luo Tian could not withstand the bear's attack. Even Chen Changsheng couldn't endure it, and Chai Xiangming sighed inwardly: "It's over!"

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light, his vital energy rapidly circulating. He clenched a fist without dodging; veins bulged on his fist, mixed with five colors. He punched forward toward the bear's palm.

"Five Elements Body, talent is good, but can't be so foolish!" Chai Xiangming mentally cursed. He wanted to rescue Luo Tian, knowing that with his spear, Luo Tian could match these people. Their strength was weak, and now Luo Tian's strength made them take him seriously.

Though Chai Xiangming wanted to rescue, he was powerless; the black bear's palm had already struck Luo Tian. He could almost see Luo Tian being smashed into meat paste.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed, cracks spreading from Luo Tian's feet outward.

Chai Xiangming's face was filled with shock, as was Chen Changsheng's; in their eyes, the bear that had immense strength had been repelled by Luo Tian. Luo Tian's body merely bent slightly.

The fine cracks under Luo Tian's feet made Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming feel the bear's terrifying attack. Chen Changsheng had been struck once and lost his combat ability, but Luo Tian had endured the bear's attack.

"I feel like he's gotten stronger again!" Chen Changsheng muttered, looking at Luo Tian with indescribable shock.

Chai Xiangming thought back to his mockery of Luo Tian, feeling a burning sensation on his face. This Luo Tian was clearly the strongest among them! And he had even wanted to fight him before!

A trickle of blood slowly flowed from Luo Tian's mouth; he had underestimated the bear's strength. His internal organs felt displaced, obviously injured.

"Roar..." The bear seemed enraged by this repeated provocation and roared again, rushing toward Luo Tian like a black whirlwind.

Luo Tian's hands quickly changed positions; the King's Seal formed swiftly in his hands. Luo Tian knew that this bear, at bone-attainment initial stage, could only block the King's Seal for a short time.

"Boom..." The seal struck the bear, but it seemed to ignore it, swatting the King's Seal away with its palm.

Feeling the bear's body pause, Luo Tian's eyes flashed gold; he roared: "Now!"

"Golden Snake Madness!" Five golden snakes converged into a long dragon, vaguely carrying the aura of the dragon clan. The entire first level of the tower was illuminated, roaring toward the bear.

Under this dragon aura, the five beasts slowed down, their red eyes showing a glimmer of clarity. Their bodies trembled slightly, and the black energy around them gradually faded.

The people surrounding the beasts did not miss this opportunity, all unleashing their strongest attacks toward the beasts.

Suddenly, the first level of the tower erupted with unprecedented vital energy fluctuations.

The golden dragon fiercely collided with the bear's massive body, sending it flying backward and crashing to the ground with a heavy sound.

Chen Changsheng wielded his dust brush, and together with the other three, they combined their strength to send a leopard-shaped beast flying. It fell to the ground and groaned.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The heavy sounds continued.

At the same time, the other three beasts also lost their combat ability and fell to the ground.

The fifteen people panted, looking at the five fallen beasts with joy. Their gazes toward Luo Tian no longer held previous contempt but instead a cautious look, one reserved for equals.

Leng Qiuchan's face remained calm; beneath her black veil, her lips slightly curled. She naturally knew Luo Tian was not merely at body refinement eighth level. But when she saw the look of caution in others' eyes toward Luo Tian, a sense of pride arose within her—more joy than when she was valued by others.

"These beasts, what should we do? Kill them?" Chai Xiangming's face bore a killing intent as he approached the bear that had made them so miserable.

"Roar..." The bear's face showed a touch of pain; its black body was wrapped in strands of black energy, growling clearly indicating it had been wounded by Luo Tian's spear.

"Let them go; these beasts are likely the guardian beasts of various tribes. Now they're clearly controlled!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze briefly scanning the corner where Leng Qiuchan stood.

"Luo Tian! These are beasts!" Chai Xiangming spoke softly.

Frowning, Leng Qiuchan understood Luo Tian's glance—asking if these beasts could still be saved.

Leng Qiuchan gave an imperceptible shake of her head; these beasts had been controlled for a long time, their minds eroded. To heal them was勉强 (barely) within her ability.

Luo Tian, who had been monitoring Leng Qiuchan's thoughts, felt her slight head shake and said with a pale face: "Give them a swift end!"

Chapter 2010: Soul Clan

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Chai Xiangming's eyes showed a cruel smile. Though he had been stopped by Luo Tian, his strength was clearly no weaker than theirs, even giving him a sense of being stronger. Thus, he respected Luo Tian's opinion.

Others from the two groups also stepped forward, approaching the beasts they had fought. Some faces were cold; others were complex.

Their experiences here were similar to Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan's, but while Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan chose to help, others chose to ignore due to their own vitality.

Yet they felt some pity; these ordinary tribe people were so simple, and now these beasts had been seen. To kill them made them feel reluctant.

But if they didn't kill them now, when the beasts recovered and attacked again, it would be a dilemma. Their guilt was already heavy enough.

"Kill them! They must be suffering now!" One of the black-cloaked youths beside Leng Qiuchan spoke coldly.

Hearing this, those approaching the beasts showed determination.

"Ha! You felt good chasing me, didn't you!" Chai Xiangming chuckled softly, his red sword in hand, slashing toward the bear's head. Others also unleashed their weapons, attacking the remaining beasts.

As their weapons fell, a stream of black energy rose from the five beasts.

"Roar..." A mournful roar echoed in the empty first level of the tower.

The five beasts, previously severely wounded, seemed to struggle in their final moments, attacking the people who had just killed them.

The people were startled by this sudden situation and retreated backward.

In this gap, the five beasts sprang from their feet, radiating black energy and transforming into a dark mist toward the second level of the tower.

Watching the fleeing beasts, everyone knew they could not catch up; their sudden burst of speed was too fast.

For some reason, Luo Tian felt relieved watching the beasts escape.

"Let's go up then; this level probably has nothing left!" Tu Yu Zheng looked at the vast emptiness of the first level and addressed Leng Qiuchan and her four people.

Tu Yu Zheng's gaze flickered toward Pang Haoran and Chen Changsheng, clearly not wanting his group to go up alone. They didn't know what was in the second level.

Pang Haoran nodded; they could ignore Chen Changsheng's group before, but now with Luo Tian's addition and his demonstrated strength, they had to take Chen Changsheng's group seriously.

Seeing Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran looking at him, Chen Changsheng glanced at the four people including Luo Tian. Finding they were unharmed, he nodded slightly.

With Chen Changsheng's nod, the three groups reached an agreement and walked toward the spacious stairs.

The stairs were about ten zhang long. Though their speed was not fast, they reached the second level of the Locking Spirit Tower in a short while.

"Welcome all to our Soul Clan's home; I've been waiting for you for a long time!" A tall golden seat stood in the second level of the tower. An emaciated old man sat on it, his eyes filled with amusement.

Five beasts that had fled from the first level lay on the ground, emitting whimpers. Five strands of black energy connected the beasts and the old man, making it very eerie.

A group of black-cloaked figures stood behind the old man, their faces filled with a grim atmosphere. They looked at the fifteen people entering with intense killing intent.

"Who are you? If you're wise, clear the way for us to enter the third level. If you block us, don't blame us for being unkind!" Pang Haoran spoke first, shouting loudly.

"Of course I can let you go up, but since you've arrived at my Soul Clan, there's no way I can avoid hospitality!" The old man spoke softly.

" Hospitality is unnecessary; just let me go up!"

"Hurry and clear the way!" The group all shouted.

"Since you don't want to stay, then I'll have no choice but to keep you here forever!" The old man opened his hazy eyes, looking at Luo Tian and the others.

"Only by your people?" Pang Haoran sneered, his face filled with mockery.

These black-cloaked figures were indeed strong, but it depended on who they were compared to. Compared to the tribes like the Tiger Clan, they were strong; but compared to these prodigies, they were somewhat lacking.

"Yes, only by them!" The old man waved his hand toward the back.

"Kill!" The hundreds of black-cloaked figures shouted, as if brainwashed, fearlessly rushing toward the fifteen people.

"Finally, I can avenge them!" Chen Changsheng roared, recalling the people who had died in the Deer Clan and rushed into the crowd with red eyes.

Feeling Chen Changsheng's state was off, Luo Tian furrowed his brows, recalling the half-dust brush he had seen at the Deer Clan. He understood the situation.

Seeing these people who caused heavy casualties in the Tiger Clan, Luo Tian's eyes also flashed with killing intent and followed Chen Changsheng into the black-cloaked crowd.

Tu Yu Zheng roared, rushing toward the black-cloaked crowd. But a fragrant breeze passed by, and a black silhouette with strong killing intent rushed ahead of him.

Black energy surrounded Leng Qiuchan's body; her eyes filled with killing intent as she leaped into the black-cloaked crowd like a leopard.

"Kill..." Others all roared, rushing into the crowd.

This was a slaughter without disparity; if the fifteen people didn't use their vitality, they were slightly stronger than these people. After using it, they became merciless killers.

Blood filled the second level of the tower, and the thick scent of blood entered Luo Tian's nose, making him uncomfortable. A force within his body seemed to stir uncontrollably.

Luo Tian felt tense; this force was the killing intent he had forcibly suppressed when merging with the Killing Pearl. Now, after another slaughter, it was slowly reawakened within him.

The fifteen people slaughtered the black-cloaked figures like chickens, but these figures seemed fearless of death. Their comrades' deaths made no difference to them; they still attacked Luo Tian's group.

As time passed, although the fifteen people were initially fierce, their vitality was limited and gradually consumed. Everyone felt a bad feeling.

Chapter 211: Trapped

Hidden Domain, Locking Spirit Tower, Second Level.

The slaughter continued; the fifteen people had gone mad and numb, not caring about their vitality consumption as they slaughtered the Soul Clan's people.

Finally, when Luo Tian pierced the last black-cloaked figure with his spear, the second level of the tower no longer had any black-cloaked figures. Only the old man sitting on the golden seat remained.

The old man's face still bore a smile, as if he hadn't killed his people. Five strands of black energy still connected to the five beasts, but their bodies had shrunk and looked withered. Their eyes were closed.

The fifteen people panted heavily, having felt their vitality nearly depleted after the slaughter. Their faces showed a serious expression; they knew this old man was the most challenging opponent in the second level.

The fifteen people did not hesitate, consuming elixirs and placing them into their mouths.

Luo Tian looked at the corpses scattered around, his killing intent growing stronger. He glanced at Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming, his eyes also filled with killing intent.

Including Chen Changsheng, the others felt a slight chill on their necks and looked toward the source. They found Luo Tian's eyes had turned a blood-red color.

"Luo Tian! Are you alright?" Chen Changsheng asked with concern.

Luo Tian circulated the vitality he had just recovered through elixirs, forcing down that thread of killing intent and smiled: "I'm fine!"

Leng Qiuchan looked at Luo Tian, sensing his unease. Her eyes showed worry.

But before they could observe Luo Tian's changes, a voice echoed from the old man sitting on the golden seat.

"Old man, your people are all dead; you're alone now. What tricks do you have to stop us?" Pang Haoran spoke, his face filled with mockery. Though he felt the old man was strange, he couldn't detect any strong fluctuations from him—perhaps even weaker than those they had killed.

The old man said nothing, gently waving his hand. Five strands of black energy transformed into five black dragons and entered the old man's body.

The five beasts had no signs of life, their faces showing a touch of pain.

"I have no strength, but I can still stop you!" The old man remained seated, his eyes flashing with sharpness.

"Then I'll see what you can do!" Pang Haoran, not believing it, strode toward the golden seat with caution.

Seeing Pang Haoran approaching him, the old man smiled slightly, his emaciated hands extending like five chopsticks.

At the moment the old man extended his hands, fifteen black dragons flew out from his fingers, formed by countless seals. They rushed toward the fifteen people.

Everyone knew this was definitely not good, and they scattered to escape.

Luo Tian's face was serious; as he quickly fled, his spiritual sense probed outward. However, his spiritual sense had just touched the black dragons and was absorbed into them like nourishment.
