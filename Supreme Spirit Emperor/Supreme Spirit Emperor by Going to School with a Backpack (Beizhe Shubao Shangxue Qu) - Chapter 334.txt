“What in the world is this? Even the Royal Weapon couldn’t withstand it! Could it be the power of immortals?” The three men trembled with fear, their eyes fixed on the white light that had pierced through their defense and now stood before them. Their gazes reflected despair.

“Sweep!” Xuanbing Elder and his companions watched the terrifying scene, their eyes filled with awe as they saw it return to Luo Tian—more precisely, into Luo Tian’s consciousness, where the Epoch Book resided.

“Push everything aside! No one but the Epoch Lord could withstand it!” Xuanbing Elder’s voice carried reverence as he spoke softly.

“Pf…” There was no surprise. The white light swept over the three men, severing them at the waist without a chance to resist. Blood mist scattered across the stars.

After cutting down the three, the white light did not stop but continued to spread outward, even creeping toward the Huanyu Continent.

“What in the world!” Old Saman sat cross-legged in the Divine Beast Hall, his eyelids twitching. He then felt a terrifying fluctuation sweeping toward the Huanyu Continent.

Old Saman extended his hand, and a resplendent wolf mace—once enshrined in the Divine Beast Hall—materialized in his grasp. His figure also appeared outside the star domain.

At that very moment, Old Saman’s eyelids twitched again, his eyes filled with astonishment.

The entire star domain was shrouded in the vast white light, which spread toward the Huanyu Continent. It seemed about to engulf it.

“Damn thing!” Old Saman roared, his cultivation reaching its peak. His body instantly expanded to a hundred feet tall, wielding the Royal Weapon of the Huanyu Clan. He swung it fiercely toward the white light.

The thunderous roar echoed, and a violent fluctuation swept toward the white light, attempting to halt its spread.

“Stop it!” Old Saman continuously swung his wolf mace, using his Epoch Peak cultivation to withstand the terrifying fluctuation.

The Epoch Book was driven by Luo Tian and others, but Old Saman, an Epoch Peak powerhouse with a Royal Weapon at his side, was far away. Under his full power, the apocalyptic fluctuation finally repelled the spreading light.

“What in the world is this!” Old Saman’s eyes flashed as he flew toward Luo Tian and his group.

“Go!” Luo Tian panted heavily, ignoring the fates of Tu Yekang and the others. He soared into the gray void toward the space warship.

As Luo Tian’s group vanished, Old Saman appeared beneath the annihilated starfield. He saw Tu Yekang and the others, pale and barely revived.

“You?” Old Saman furrowed his brows slightly, gazing at the pitiful Tu Yekang. His eyes held a hint of confusion.

He naturally knew about the alliance of three clans attacking the Seven Star Island, but he hadn’t expected them to suffer such a fate with their three Royal Weapons.

“I told you, you’d regret it. You just wouldn’t listen!” Old Saman spoke softly, his voice laced with disdain.

“Elder Saman, that human boy named Luo Tian has the Epoch Book!” Tu Yekang saw Old Saman approaching and immediately spoke.

“Ah, so it’s the Epoch Book! No wonder!” Upon hearing Tu Yekang’s words, Old Saman showed no expression, as if he had known all along that Luo Tian possessed the Epoch Book.

“Elder Saman, won’t you chase after it? The Epoch Book is a symbol of kingship. If you obtain it, perhaps you could become a king!” Seeing Old Saman’s impassive face without any desire to act, Tu Yekang and the others were bewildered.

The Epoch Book was an unparalleled treasure. Who wouldn’t be tempted? Yet this elder showed no reaction. What was going on?

“The Epoch Book is good, but it’s too tempting for people to covet. Moreover, do you think something that surpasses the Royal Weapons so greatly is accessible to just anyone?” Old Saman sneered, speaking softly.

Of course, he was tempted. But he knew that even if he obtained the Epoch Book, with the current strength of the Huanyu Clan, they couldn’t protect it. Once his acquisition became known, the Huanyu Continent would become a battleground.

The Huanyu Clan loved combat but couldn’t withstand the covetousness of myriad clans. Moreover, they had been severely wounded in the past by Zhongli Tian and Miaoyin’s Master. Unlike the Star Moon Divine Clan, which had three Epoch Peak masters, the entire Huanyu Continent now only had him as an Epoch Peak master.

“Alas…” Upon hearing Old Saman’s words, Tu Yekang and the others fell silent. They knew Old Saman truly had no intention of pursuing it.

Luo Tian and his group, desperate, flew through the void with excitement in their eyes. Luo Tian led them toward the space warship.

After flying for a brief moment, they spotted the space warship hovering in the gray void. Their faces lit up with joy.

“Pf…” The group collapsed onto the space warship, their faces showing excitement.

“It’s over!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, beginning to recover quickly.

“Master Elders have returned!” As they appeared, the entire space warship erupted into chaos. People’s eyes showed surprise as they gazed at the battered Luo Tian and his group, and cheers echoed through the gray void.

“Go!” Xuanbing Elder shouted to the people, his voice still anxious, fearing further changes.

“Yes!” Each of the Seven Star Island’s people showed excitement. They poured their Epoch energy into the space warship.

“Buzz…” The massive ship hummed, breaking through the oppressive void pressure. It followed the direction indicated by the black and white qi on the altar.

After a brief rest, Luo Tian returned to the altar, touching the black and white qi.

“I’m going back!” Without hesitation, Luo Tian communicated with the Yin Fish Tortoise Armor. Though he didn’t know if it would receive him, he needed to inform the Nine Domains’ people.

“Another fluctuation!” In the grand hall of Wuxing Mountain, the Yin Fish Tortoise Armor trembled again. Then it heard Luo Tian’s message—though fragmented, the Yin Fish Spirit still captured his meaning.

“Luo Xiong, hurry! There’s something big—great news!” The Yin Fish Armor instantly emitted radiant light. An ancient voice echoed in Luo Xiong and Luo Nan Tian’s minds.

“Yin Fish Elder, what is it?” Luo Xiong and his wife Luo Nan Tian appeared instantly in the hall, their faces showing respect as they addressed the Yin Fish Armor.

Luo Tian had vanished, but the Yin Fish Armor hadn’t left. It remained on the Tianyuan Continent to protect them.

“The Epoch Book is returning!” The Yin Fish Spirit conveyed to Luo Xiong and his wife, its voice carrying a hint of joy.

“What!” Upon hearing the Yin Fish Spirit’s words, Luo Xiong and his wife trembled. Their eyes showed disbelief, as if they hadn’t heard correctly.

“I said, the Epoch Book is returning!” The Yin Fish Spirit spoke again. They immediately wept and laughed wildly.

“I knew he’d return! Four years, and when he comes back, he’ll definitely subdue everything!” Luo Xiong laughed loudly.

“Quickly contact Qianxue, don’t let them search anymore. They haven’t returned in four years. We’ll finally be reunited!” Luo Xiong instantly recovered, addressing the excited Luo Nan Tian.

“Luo Tian’s return might make those people quiet!” The Yin Fish Spirit sat within the tortoise armor, its eyes also showing a hint of joy.

After contacting the Yin Fish Spirit, Luo Tian sat cross-legged again, suppressing his excitement and continuing to recover.

The massive ancient warship continuously traversed the void. Though its speed seemed slow, people knew that if it broke through the void, they might end up anywhere.

“Buzz…” As people gradually calmed down, a pale figure slowly appeared in front of the space warship. If not carefully observed, one couldn’t see the old man’s form—his presence seemed to merge with the void itself.

“Human clan, indeed has a way back to the Nine Domains!” The old man spoke softly. His aged hand rose, forming a gray palm that spread across the sky, crushing the space warship.

Chapter 1358: Another Encounter with the Mortal Clan

“What is that?” As the gray palm struck the space warship, the Seven Star Island’s people instantly sensed the old man’s presence and the apocalyptic aura on his palm.

Luo Tian’s group also opened their eyes, their gazes filled with solemnity—more so than when facing the three Epoch Peak masters before.

“Epoch Peak powerhouse!” Xuanbing Elder exclaimed, feeling an irresistible aura from the old man.

“The Mortal Clan!” Luo Tian gazed at the gray palm, his eyes narrowing. He felt a familiar aura on it—this gray palm was identical to the one that had intercepted him and Fu Xingyue when they returned via the transmission array.

“Activate the ship’s defense!” Xuanbing Elder’s face paled. His hands moved, and his recovered Epoch energy surged into the space warship.

Light flashed, forming a golden barrier that instantly enveloped the ship.

“Pf…” The void trembled. The gray palm struck the space warship, causing it to vibrate. Some people with low cultivation spat blood, their eyes filled with shock as they gazed at the old man who had flown to the ship’s front.

“What do we do?” Xuanbing Elder and others showed bitterness, gazing at the old man who stood before them with a smile.

An Epoch Peak powerhouse was beyond their ability to resist. Moreover, they were all injured and at less than three-tenths of their usual strength.

“Everyone, I’ve been waiting for you a long time. You didn’t disappoint me—escaping from those three clans’ trash!” The gray-robed old man smiled, gazing at Luo Tian’s group.

“First, let me introduce myself. I am Mingyi, an elder of the Mortal Clan!” The old man said.

“Why did you stop us?” he asked, his voice carrying a negotiating tone. “I just want to borrow your ship for a while. Do you think it’s possible to lend it to me?”

“Kill!” Xuanbing Elder’s face darkened. They had already planned to use their Epoch energy.

“Buzz…” Under the combined effort of everyone, the space warship instantly emitted brilliant light, illuminating the void. Vast gray gas surged.

A beam of ultimate light shot from the space warship, sweeping toward Mingyi. Mingyi’s aged eyes showed a hint of seriousness.

“Seems like you don’t want to cooperate. So many people ganging up on an old man!” Mingyi smiled, his hands shifting. Gray energy surged, forming a gray seal to suppress the ultimate light beam.

In an instant, two powerful attacks collided. The light beam shattered, and Mingyi’s seal transformed into a storm of gray gas that swept through the void.

“What do we do? I can only unleash this attack once!” Xuanbing Elder’s face darkened, transmitting to Luo Tian and others.

“Don’t even think about using the Epoch Book!” Luo Tian shook his head. Using the Epoch Book would be too draining, beyond their current capacity. Moreover, he wasn’t sure if the Epoch Book’s master would still cooperate.

“I still have the Red Lotus Lamp!” A low voice spoke. Shen Gong Feichi addressed them, his voice laced with madness.

“Buzz…” But as Shen Gong Feichi’s words just finished, the red ancient lamp flew from his hand. No matter how he called or urged it, he couldn’t retrieve it.

In everyone’s sight, the Red Lotus Lamp vanished into the swirling gray gas. Shen Gong Feichi’s face turned dark.

“The Red Lotus Lamp was summoned back by the Blood Clan through special means!” Shen Gong Feichi spoke, knowing where the lamp had gone.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He knew that the Royal Clan and Holy Sites had special methods to recall Royal Weapons and Epoch Treasures. But now, it was fatal for them.

Luo Tian waved his hand, summoning the stone tablet that had recorded the Reincarnation Heaven Art. At this moment, they had no other means but the space warship.

“Suppress!” Luo Tian unleashed the Eight Directions Reincarnation Art. The gray stone tablet emitted a deafening roar, expanding into a gray star that radiated apocalyptic power, crushing toward Mingyi.

“Little one, don’t you know to respect the elderly?” Mingyi’s smile remained. His gray palm formed again, striking toward the gray Reincarnation Stone Tablet.

“Boom…” The void trembled. The two collided, even causing the massive space warship to vibrate.

Gray energy obscured people’s vision. After an hour, the gray gas finally calmed down. Mingyi reappeared in their sight, while the gray stone tablet crashed toward the space warship.

“Pf…” The gray stone tablet struck Luo Tian, causing him to spit blood. Even Xuanbing Elder and others who tried to stop it were thrown back, their bodies colliding with the ship’s arm before stopping.

“Too strong. There’s no way to fight back!” Xuanbing Elder felt despair, gazing at Mingyi who stood there with a smile.

Another gray seal formed in Mingyi’s hands, radiating apocalyptic power. It crashed toward the space warship.

“Done!” Everyone saw the apocalyptic seal and felt despair. Facing an Epoch Peak powerhouse, they couldn’t resist.

“Buzz…” However, as the gray seal flew from Mingyi’s hands, a golden character suddenly emerged from the void, rushing toward the gray seal.

“Again you! The last time you intervened. This time I’ll see what you can do!” Mingyi’s eyes turned cold, his gaze filled with a hint of caution as he addressed the void.

“Another powerful elder!” Luo Tian gazed at the golden character, his face showing a hint of joy. He thought back to that powerful elder who had helped him and Fu Xingyue when they were intercepted in the transmission array.

If not for that elder’s help, he and Fu Xingyue might have perished in the void.

“Who are you?” Mingyi roared at the void, his white hair flying. His aged eyes burst with powerful killing intent. His aura surged at this moment, sending a wave of pressure that made Luo Tian and others feel heart-pounding.

“Is this the power of an Epoch Peak powerhouse? His aura alone makes me feel I can’t resist!” Xuanbing Elder’s face showed a hint of fear, gazing at Mingyi.

“Divination… divining the primordial divine hexagram…” A calm yet ancient voice rose from the void, indistinguishable in origin.

In an instant, a old man wearing a torn robe and carrying a broken staff appeared before them. His eyes were lifeless, devoid of black pupils—like an old blind man.

“Him!” Luo Tian’s mind stirred. He gazed at the blind elder standing before the space warship, waves of shock surging within him. He hadn’t expected this terrifying elder to appear and help them.

“Familiar feeling! I feel like I’ve seen him somewhere before!” Shen Gong Feichi, his blood energy surging, showed confusion in his crimson eyes.

“It was the blind old man at the trading market!” Luo Tian spoke softly, reminding Shen Gong Feichi.

“I remember now. We gave him some yuanqi stones!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s reminder, Shen Gong Feichi also recalled the old blind man who had seemed like a scammer. His face showed disbelief.

“I remember he said he wanted to take the副 island master as his disciple!” Shen Gong Feichi seemed to recall something, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Yes!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He had once seen the old blind man in the Huanyu Clan. He hadn’t expected this elder to have saved him twice.

“Who are you exactly?” Mingyi’s face turned solemn as he gazed at the blind old man with a broken staff, asking.

“Old. I’ve long forgotten my name!” The blind old man spoke softly, his voice impossibly ethereal.

“Don’t you all leave yet?” The blind old man turned, his white eyes gazing at Luo Tian and others on the ship. He spoke softly.

“Thank you, elder!” Xuanbing Elder and others knelt before the blind old man, their eyes showing respect. His power and age were terrifying.

“I see. You’re still alive!” Mingyi scrutinized the blind old man, his eyes showing disbelief.

“Ji Jiu You!” Mingyi spoke each word clearly. His voice carried shock, his aged eyes staring intently at the blind old man.

“Who is Ji Jiu You?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion. He gazed at Xuanbing Elder and others, seeing their brows furrowed.

“Ji Jiu You? It seems he was called that!” The blind old man sighed softly. He then pointed, a golden light flashing into the space warship.

At that moment, the space warship emitted a series of roars. It then suddenly launched into the gray void.

“Where are you going!” Mingyi’s eyes showed anger, gazing at the ship that had vanished into the void. His feet emitted a humming sound, rushing toward the ship.

“Return!” The blind old man, Ji Jiu You, spoke softly. He took the broken staff from his shoulder and threw it toward Mingyi.

A storm of gray energy rose, sweeping the entire void. It rushed toward Mingyi.

“Old fool! You should have died!” Mingyi’s eyes showed cruelty. He felt the terrifying aura behind him, unable to do anything but watch Luo Tian’s group escape. Turning around, he confronted the blind old man.

Chapter 1359: The Arrival of Heaven’s Decline

In the boundless void, the massive ship continuously broke through thick gray gas, traversing the void. Luo Tian and others stood there, feeling the void behind them constantly rupturing. Their eyes showed shock.

“Too terrifying! We’re lucky that blind old man blocked Mingyi. Otherwise, we’d all be dead!” Yun Wuya and others murmured.

“Who is Ji Jiu You? This powerful elder—what’s his identity?” Bai Ze spoke softly, causing everyone to show confusion.

“An outstanding genius eight million years ago. He was called the one most likely to become an Epoch Lord. Later, for unknown reasons, he vanished. Legends say he died. Yet now, he’s still alive! If he lived another two million years, he would have lived through an epoch!” Bai Ze held a ancient book, speaking to them.

“My god! That’s a living fossil! Eight million years!” Shen Gong Fu exclaimed in shock. Others also gasped.

“The lifespan of an Epoch Peak powerhouse is six million years. Only the Epoch Lord can live through an epoch. How did he survive until now!” People were filled with shock, their eyes showing disbelief.

Luo Tian was also deeply shocked. He hadn’t expected the man to have such a terrifying identity and age, beyond people’s comprehension.

“Too terrifying! Who knew the human clan had such a superpower elder!” People couldn’t help but sigh.

“Deputy Island Master! That super powerful man wanted to take you as his disciple! You refused, my god!” Shen Gong Feichi seemed to return to his nature, shouting on the ship.

“Hiss…” Luo Tian also couldn’t help but gasp. He hadn’t expected the man to be so fierce.

Others looked at Luo Tian with strange expressions. Such a living fossil, if he said he wanted to take disciples, would cause a huge uproar. Luo Tian had directly refused.

“I didn’t know he was that fierce back then! I just felt he was terrifying and wanted to run!” Luo Tian inwardly roared.

“Never mind. Focus on recovery. With such a fierce man blocking Mingyi, if Mingyi doesn’t die, it’s his luck!” Xuanbing Elder, after being shocked, spoke to Luo Tian and others. Since the void held unknown dangers, they needed to maintain peak condition.

“Hmm.” Luo Tian and others nodded. They sat cross-legged again on the ship, beginning to recover.

Time flowed slowly. In a blink, the massive ship had traversed the void for seven days.

After seven days, Xuanbing Elder slowly opened his eyes. He gazed at the ship still traversing the void, letting out a deep breath. He didn’t leave, guarding them.

After ten days, Yun Wuya and Bai Ze, among other elders, fully recovered. After fourteen days, Guan Xingjian, Shen Gong Fu, and Shen Gong Feichi emerged from the ship.

“Still missing Luo Tian?” People looked at Luo Tian sitting on the altar, showing confusion. They hadn’t expected him to still not recover after so long.

Among them, Luo Tian had the strongest recovery ability. His physique and bloodline were far stronger than theirs.

“What’s wrong? I feel Luo Tian’s aura is unstable, and his strength seems to be declining?” Xuanbing Elder furrowed his brows slightly. He gazed at Luo Tian, who was still closed-eyed, showing confusion.

“Ugh…” At this moment, Luo Tian was indeed in pain. He hadn’t expected an unexpected event to happen to him.

“Heaven’s Decline!” Luo Tian had even forgotten about Heaven’s Decline. But now, it had descended upon him, leaving him bitter.

“This damned thing!” Luo Tian knew he couldn’t resist Heaven’s Decline. But still, he wanted to fight desperately.

The void was perilous. Plus, no one knew when they’d return to the Nine Domains. His enemies were too many. If he truly returned to the Nine Domains and became a commoner, it would be too tragic.

“Ah…” Two reincarnation immortal bodies fiercely operated, trying to resist the supreme heavenly power. But it only slightly delayed.

With a hum, two powerful reincarnation immortal bodies, under an invisible and irresistible fluctuation, rapidly withered. Finally, they seemed sealed, leaving Luo Tian unable to control them.

“Damn!” Luo Tian struggled for a moment before slowly opening his eyes. He muttered under his breath.

“What’s wrong?” Xuanbing Elder and others observed Luo Tian. Upon seeing his aura rapidly decline, nearly gone, their faces changed.

“It’s Heaven’s Decline!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. His eyes showed bitterness. He had become a commoner again, making him somewhat uncomfortable.

“Heaven’s Decline!” The others heard Luo Tian’s words and shook their heads. Against Heaven’s Decline, there was no solution. Even the Epoch Lord in youth couldn’t resist it.

“Alright, we’re here!” Xuanbing Elder smiled slightly, comforting Luo Tian.

“Yes. I entrust all of you elders!” Luo Tian bowed slightly and then descended from the altar.

……

“In the void, the blind old man smiled. He continuously fought against Mingyi. Each move caused Mingyi to spit blood, leaving him in a terrible state. Yet the blind old man remained calm and unaffected.

“Since Heaven’s Decline has arrived, he can go there!” The blind old man sighed softly. His hands shifted slightly. His aged fingers extended, drawing complex patterns in the void. His eyes showed seriousness.

“Go!” Mingyi, his body wounded, saw that Ji Jiu You hadn’t attacked again. His face showed a hint of excitement.

Too terrifying! He had fought with Ji Jiu You for nearly half a month. No matter what methods he used, the other could easily neutralize them with one palm. Each attack left him severely wounded.

“Invincible!” After fighting Ji Jiu You, Mingyi truly understood the meaning of invincibility. He didn’t linger but vanished into the void.

“Buzz…” Ignoring Mingyi’s departure, complex patterns formed in Ji Jiu You’s hands. They were engraved into the void.

……

After Ji Jiu You completed his patterns, a series of roars echoed from Luo Tian’s storage ring.

“Pf…” The gray stone tablet flew out of the storage ring, crashing down toward Luo Tian. This startled him.

A series of complex patterns glowed on the gray stone tablet, then gray gas surged. It enveloped Luo Tian.

The hum echoed. In the shocked gaze of Xuanbing Elder and others, Luo Tian had no power to resist. He vanished from their sight.

“What’s happening!” Xuanbing Elder reached out, trying to retrieve Luo Tian. But he was forcefully repelled by an irresistible force.

“Boom…” Then, the gray stone tablet slowly rose. It soared into the sky, crashing toward the ship’s powerful barrier.

The solid barrier shattered under the gray stone tablet’s impact. Turbulent void currents rushed into the ship.

“Damn!” Xuanbing Elder and others showed disbelief. They watched the gray stone tablet exit the ship, vanishing from their sight.

Xuanbing Elder and others showed a hint of fear. They watched the tablet enter the gray void, breaking through violent gray gas and vanishing from their sight.

“First, repair the barrier!” Xuanbing Elder’s eyes were deep. He pressed his hand, mending the golden barrier.

“What in the world is happening!” The others showed anxiety. They knew Luo Tian’s current state was only slightly better than a commoner. If he were in the void, he had no chance of survival.

“Maybe it’s okay. The gray stone tablet is definitely not ordinary. With its protection, Luo Tian should be safe. But I’m more worried he might get lost in this void!” Shen Gong Fu spoke softly, his voice laced with concern.

“Good fortune will come to those who are destined. Perhaps it’s a good thing. With the tablet’s speed, even the space warship couldn’t catch up!” Xuanbing Elder shook his head softly.

Luo Tian now found himself in the stone tablet’s space. His eyes showed confusion, unsure why the tablet had suddenly sent him here. He didn’t know he had already left the space warship.

“Let me stay in here for ten years. It’s fine!” Luo Tian shook his head, sighing. He was now a fish at others’ mercy with no power. He could only let things take their course.

“Open!” The blind old man, Ji Jiu You, showed a hint of nostalgia. His hands glowed with radiant light. He gazed at the gray stone tablet before him, gently tapping it.

Golden light flashed in Ji Jiu You’s hands. It formed a golden door, slowly opening. The gray Reincarnation Stone Tablet entered the golden door.

“Kid, enjoy your ten years inside. When you come out, perhaps you’ll face a massive battle!” Ji Jiu You spoke softly.

“Ugh…” As Ji Jiu You’s words just finished, a soft whimper echoed. This made Ji Jiu You’s white eyes narrow slightly.

In an instant, a colorful flame flew from the distant void. The terrifying temperature made Ji Jiu You feel shocked.

What stunned Ji Jiu You most was that the flame took a human form. Though not an adult, its height was about that of a few-year-old child.

Chapter 1360: The Place of Intercepting Heaven

“Pf…” The massive stone tablet, like a gray mountain, crashed onto the ground. Then, gray light flickered. Luo Tian’s body lay battered on the ground.

“Vomit…” As he fell, Luo Tian vomited. His eyes showed bitterness. He hadn’t experienced this in years.

“Where am I!” After vomiting a few times, Luo Tian stood up dazedly. His gaze showed confusion as he looked around. His face changed abruptly.

“This isn’t the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian’s face changed abruptly. Since he was in the stone tablet space, he didn’t know how much time had passed. But he knew he hadn’t spent ten years inside the stone tablet.

“Where am I? I shouldn’t be on the space warship!” Luo Tian questioned, looking around. Now a commoner, his vision was limited. He could only see the densest forest and hear flowing water.

“Big brother, where did you take me?”

“I wish I could return to the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian gazed at the gray stone tablet, his eyes showing a hint of bitterness. He was regretful for bringing it back.

“This place’s rules are strange!” Luo Tian soon noticed the special nature of this place—that there was no qi.

“How could this be? I didn’t expect such a place!” Luo Tian felt shocked. His gaze was deep.

Now, with no cultivation power at all, he wasn’t exactly a commoner. At least due to his physique, his strength was much greater than ordinary people.

“Gurgle…” A series of sounds echoed from Luo Tian’s stomach. He felt helpless, cursing inwardly: “I’m hungry again!”

“Never mind. First find something to eat!” Luo Tian sighed softly, stepping into the forest.

“What a terrible place. Not even a fruit! Don’t let there be any fierce beasts!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, gazing at the forest that blocked sunlight. He searched for something to eat.

“Roar…” A low roar echoed. Just as Luo Tian’s words finished, a growl sounded in his ears. He couldn’t help but shiver.

“Just like that, it came!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He recognized the roar as a tiger’s growl. He turned back to run.

But he was too late. As soon as he turned, a wind sound echoed behind him. He immediately turned around and felt his heart tremble.

Before him stood a colorful tiger, its green eyes showing fierce limbs. Its eyes glowed with greed as it gazed at Luo Tian.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. This tiger wasn’t even a fierce beast. If he had his cultivation, one glance or spit could annihilate a group of them. But now, he knew his situation.

“If this beast eats me, I’ll really be冤!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. He ran.

But soon he regretted it. Running against a tiger, his cultivation had dropped, and so did his intelligence.

As Luo Tian took a step, the tiger launched an attack. Its four legs pushed off the ground like a yellow lightning bolt, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Get out!” Luo Tian saw the tiger approaching and roared. He immediately turned, throwing a punch.

“Pf…” A heavy sound echoed on the tiger’s chest. Luo Tian’s body took several steps back.

Luo Tian still had strength despite his cultivation drop. The tiger let out a whimper, then groaned in pain and fell to the ground.

“Pfft. You’re just a kid! I can beat you ten times!” Luo Tian showed disdain in his eyes. His chest was also scratched by the tiger’s claws, causing him pain.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian finished speaking, the tiger stood up again. It seemed to have been provoked into a frenzy, its eyes turning red.

Moreover, another tiger rushed out of the forest. Luo Tian wished he could hit himself twice.

“Damn! Did I get lucky?” Luo Tian had no words. He looked around, trying to find a suitable weapon. But all he saw were withered branches.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian searched, two tigers rushed toward him—one in front and one behind.

“This really is the end. I’m so pitiful! A Reincarnation Body of Epoch Initial, dying in a tiger’s belly. If this gets out, the enemies will laugh to death!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly and decided to fight back.
