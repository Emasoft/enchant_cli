“Let my decree be known: From today onwards, Zhang Daotian shall be the Young Master of the Tian Dao Sect. His status is second only to the Sect Leader, and he shall command the hundred thousand disciples and elders of the Tian Dao Sect!” Murong Cheng’s voice echoed across Tian Dao Mountain, resonating within the minds of every disciple and elder of the sect.

“Young Master!”

“Our Tian Dao Sect has finally acquired a Young Master!” The disciples and elders of the Tian Dao Sect bore expressions of astonishment. None had anticipated that Zhang Daotian would be personally appointed as Young Master by the First Ancestor Murong Cheng, an occurrence unprecedented in history.

“Hah! Who the hell is saying we’re all纨绔 (luxurious, idle)? I’ll break your legs!” Ren Hongzhi and the other descendants of the sect’s elders laughed heartily, expressing their joy for Zhang Daotian.

As people murmured among themselves, Luo Tian had already absorbed the primordial energy. A thunderous rumbling emanated from his body.

With each pulse, Luo Tian’s aura ascended steadily, reaching the Soul Initiation Phase I. It continued to climb gradually.

“Soul Initiation Phase II!” Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze deep and piercing like lightning striking the heavens. As he opened his eyes, his cultivation stabilized at Soul Initiation Phase II—only a breath away from Soul Initiation Phase III.

“Powerful!” At this moment, Luo Tian felt an unprecedented strength. He could easily wound a Soul Initiation Phase I cultivator and slay one at the peak of Yuan Spirit.

“I shall go to the Wen Xin Sect. I wish to see what this sect’s prodigies are capable of!” Luo Tian’s figure materialized into the sky, his long hair flowing. His gaze turned toward the outer reaches of Tian Dao Mountain, and his commanding voice echoed across the sect.

“Good! Daotian, we’ll accompany you!” Ren Hongzhi and others leapt to Luo Tian’s side, joining him with Zheng Xin, making a total of ten people.

These ten bore youthful faces but exuded confidence. Their gazes carried arrogance, for after traversing the Reincarnation Bridge, their strength had vastly increased. None feared any prodigy.

“Go then. I shall follow later. It’s time for you to venture out and make your mark. You’ve been too reckless before,” Siku Chen’s voice carried a sense of satisfaction, his aged tone resonating in Luo Tian’s ears.

Luo Tian bowed slightly, his face marked by respect. He paid homage to the Dan Sect’s mountain peak.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian gave a low command, leading Zheng Xin and Ren Hongzhi out of Tian Dao Mountain toward the Wen Xin Sect.

“Who knows if these brats’纨绔 (luxurious, idle) nature will stir up chaos in the Wen Xin Sect?” Murong Cheng’s face bore a faint smile as he muttered softly.

“Siku, don’t you worry these little rascals might cause trouble? These aren’t exactly good boys! We should follow them, or else these little brutes might tear the heavens apart!” The other elders spoke in unison, their faces etched with smiles.

They weren’t concerned about Zhang Daotian’s safety. After all, the Tian Dao Sect was a major sect among the Twelve Daoist Gates. With Siku Chen having mastered the Chaos Power, other sects were surely wary of such a formidable strength. A cultivator who had mastered Chaos Power was no easy opponent.

“Nothing to worry about,” Siku Chen spoke softly, his figure vanishing from the Dan Sect’s mountain peak.

“Hmph. You say you won’t follow, but you still did!” The elders muttered, sensing Siku Chen’s disappearance. They returned to their own seclusion chambers. With Siku Chen present, few could dare harm Luo Tian and his companions on the仙古大陆 (Xian Gu Continent).

“Indeed, Daotian’s a prodigy. He just ascended and can’t sit still!”

“Indeed! When he was at the Yuan Spirit peak, these little prodigies were merely arrogant within the sect. Now that they’ve reached Soul Initiation, other sects are in for a world of trouble!” The disciples of the Tian Dao Sect murmured among themselves, their faces marked with schadenfreude.

……

Luo Tian and his companions had now reached the Soul Initiation Phase, their speed unparalleled. Under Ren Hongzhi’s guidance, they transformed into ten streaks of light, heading toward the Wen Xin Sect.

Along the way, they chatted and laughed. Zheng Xin, having previously been a prince of Ji Feng Valley, quickly integrated into their atmosphere due to his close relationship with Luo Tian.

What bewildered Luo Tian was that whenever they passed through other sects, these people would claim to visit as guests, lingering in the sects.

This caused the sect masters and elders to tremble in fear. Especially when they saw Luo Tian, they hurriedly offered numerous treasures, leaving Luo Tian to grimace. He hadn’t expected his master Zhang Daotian to be so “well-received!”

After three days of traveling, Luo Tian and his companions arrived at the Wen Xin Sect’s mountain peak with smiles on their faces.

“Alas! We’ve already arrived. I hadn’t flown enough yet!” One of the elder disciples muttered with disappointment.

“Indeed! We’ve made a small fortune along the way, haven’t we?”

“Hmph. It’s all because of Daotian’s reputation! They’re terrified of him!” The elder disciples chuckled as they ascended the Wen Xin Sect’s protective array.

Luo Tian observed the Wen Xin Sect’s landscape, nodding slightly with admiration. The Wen Xin Sect differed from the Tian Dao Sect; while the latter had more males, the former was dominated by females, exuding a more delicate aura.

“Hmph. These girls are all so beautiful. Since the last time Daotian sneaked a glance at them bathing, we’ve been blacklisted. We haven’t come here since!” Ren Hongzhi spoke with a nostalgic tone.

“Shut up, I’ve reformed! Today I’m here to propose marriage. Don’t cause trouble!” Luo Tian kicked Ren Hongzhi’s backside.

Ren Hongzhi’s figure flew like a meteor, colliding with the Wen Xin Sect’s protective array with thunderous sounds.

Chapter 627: One Step, All Set

Chapter 627: One Step, All Set

Ren Hongzhi’s body collided with the Wen Xin Sect’s protective array, producing a thunderous sound that startled its disciples.

“Who dares attack our Wen Xin Sect’s protective array!”

“Dare to fly above our sect!” The disciples of the Wen Xin Sect glared at Ren Hongzhi with fury.

Though Ren Hongzhi had been kicked by Luo Tian, he suffered no real harm. He rose and flew back into the sky.

“Damn it, Daotian, you bastard tricked me!” Ren Hongzhi cursed loudly, ignoring the disciples’ furious gazes.

“Announce that Jiang Yuanbai of the Wen Xin Sect is here. According to our agreement, Tian Dao Sect’s Zhang Daotian has arrived!” Luo Tian’s calm voice echoed in the disciples’ ears.

“Tian Dao Sect? Zhang Daotian?”

“That纨绔 (luxurious, idle) brat dares return to our Wen Xin Sect!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s voice, the disciples of the Wen Xin Sect grew even more indignant.

Luo Tian felt a bitter smile as he saw their gazes, which looked at him like enemies. Yet his expression remained calm.

Unbeknownst to Luo Tian, Yao Biyue’s status within the Wen Xin Sect was also remarkably high. Yet this goddess-like figure had been spied upon—had it not been for Zhang Daotian’s formidable backing, the Wen Xin Sect disciples would have already disintegrated him.

As Luo Tian’s voice faded, Gu Qianxue’s expression brightened as she stepped out of her cave.

“Ah, little sister, you truly have good fortune. You’ve even attacked our Wen Xin Sect’s protective array! That’s quite bold!” A woman’s voice carried a smile as she approached Gu Qianxue.

“Sister, you know how to tease me!” Gu Qianxue’s face flushed slightly as she gazed at the woman before her.

Yu Mingxue, like Gu Qianxue, was also a disciple of Jiang Yuanbai. The two had been under his tutelage since childhood and were as close as sisters.

“Come on, I don’t know what’s so good about this brat. He’s a scoundrel at best! I would’ve stopped this marriage if I hadn’t been in seclusion last time!” Yu Mingxue sighed, her expression complex.

“Sister, you don’t know his merits!” Gu Qianxue’s face flushed slightly as she gazed at Yu Mingxue. Due to their positions, Gu Qianxue had a fondness for her sister Yu Mingxue. Her presence reminded Gu Qianxue of Ning Qingzhu and Wang Yulan.

“Hmph… arrogant youth. He has no manners at all!” From another cave, a woman with an icy demeanor stepped out, her gaze laced with coldness.

“Zhang Daotian, what business do you have in our Wen Xin Sect?” A man flew from afar, his gaze filled with disdain as he looked at Luo Tian and his companions.

His white robes flowed like clouds, his long hair drifting in the wind. He appeared ethereal and refined.

“Ye Wende Senior!” The disciples of the Wen Xin Sect bore expressions of respect as they gazed at the man in the sky. Many female disciples’ eyes glowed with admiration toward Ye Wende.

Luo Tian nodded upon seeing Ye Wende. Simply by sensing his aura, he knew this youth was no weaker than Ma Xiujie.

“Ah, it’s the pretty boy Ye Wende. We’ve come to challenge your sect’s young prodigies! Summon Xi Tong and Meng Cheng!” Ren Hongzhi smiled as he addressed Ye Wende.

“What?”

“Did I hear correctly? They want to challenge Xi Tong and Meng Cheng? I must’ve misheard!” The disciples of the Wen Xin Sect bore expressions of disdain.

“Hmph. With your lineage’s legacy, you dare to come here and cause trouble!” A laugh echoed from afar, drawing people’s attention.

“Fan Junming! You sissy, I advise you to keep your tail tucked and behave yourself. Don’t disgust us!” Ren Hongzhi recognized this man, his expression one of disdain as he gazed at the youth who had approached them.

“Just now, I was bored. You Wen Xin Sects are all females, so why do you act so sissified? It’s embarrassing!” Ren Hongzhi didn’t wait for Ye Wende and Fan Junming to speak further, his expression one of impatience.

“Ren Hongzhi, don’t be so disrespectful. In the Tian Dao Sect you might dominate with your grandfather’s power, but here in the Wen Xin Sect, you’re nothing. To us, you’re no better than a waste of space!” Fan Junming’s face bore disdain as he spoke loudly.

“Your purpose is known. If you wish to marry Biyue, first pass our test. If you fail this trial, it’s your own fault!” Ye Wende spoke loudly, his gaze dark as he looked at Luo Tian and his companions.

“You two are what? Daring to give orders here? Let me take you on without Daotian’s help. I’ll see if your sissy and pretty boy have improved!” Ren Hongzhi cursed without hesitation, while the eight elder disciples in front of Luo Tian also shouted curses. Zheng Xin, however, was filled with excitement as he rushed to the front and cursed.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly. These people were truly rowdy, but his gaze soon turned profound as he extended his spiritual sense to scan the two men. He noticed they bore no aura of the Tian Yuan Continent and shook his head slightly.

Meanwhile, both groups continued to exchange curses. It seemed they were about to escalate into a fight, each drawing their weapons.

“What are you doing here? What kind of conduct is this!” Jiang Yuanbai’s voice echoed in their ears. A wave of immense pressure caused the two groups to immediately cease their quarrel.

A sound of breaking through the sky echoed, and at this moment, the Wen Xin Sect’s protective array ceased its operation, vanishing before Luo Tian and Ye Wende.

Jiang Yuanbai and three other white-haired elders flew from afar. Behind them followed several young people, their auras also marked by the Soul Initiation Phase, respectfully trailing behind the four elders.

Chapter 628: Reunion with Acquaintances

With Jiang Yuanbai and the four elders arriving, Luo Tian’s group finally calmed down. Ye Wende and Fan Junming bore expressions of anger toward Ren Hongzhi’s group.

Zheng Xin and Ren Hongzhi were well-known for their rowdy behavior. Even if Ye Wende and Fan Junming had ten times their number, they couldn’t match these people’s cursing skills. They were clearly agitated.

“Good, earlier than I expected!” Jiang Yuanbai and the four elders saw Ren Hongzhi’s group behind Luo Tian, their expressions slightly changing.

The four were all at the Soul Convergence Peak. They could easily sense Luo Tian’s powerful aura, even though he had only ascended two days ago and his cultivation was still unstable. They noticed it immediately.

Luo Tian bypassed Jiang Yuanbai’s group and gazed at the young people behind them.

One of the women beside Gu Qianxue made Luo Tian and his companions’ eyes widen. Zheng Xin and Ren Hongzhi even drooled.

“Wow! My heavens, am I seeing a fairy?”

“Beauty, can you leave your identity token? Can we exchange contact?” Ren Hongzhi and the others gaped, their eyes filled with admiration.

“Shameful!” Luo Tian also widened his eyes but only for a moment. The woman was indeed beautiful.

To Luo Tian, Gu Qianxue had already reached the pinnacle of beauty. But this woman was perfect. In Luo Tian’s memory, only one person could compare—Cold Autumn Cicada after removing her veil.

“Cold Autumn Cicada!” Luo Tian’s gaze flickered, scanning the woman’s slender waist. His eyes flashed with intensity.

But this gaze was perceived as lewd by the woman, who coldly glared at Luo Tian. She secretly plotted how to rescue her younger sister from this tiger’s jaws.

Gu Qianxue also noticed Luo Tian’s gaze. When she saw him looking at her younger sister’s waist, her face bore a slight anger. However, after noticing the token on her younger sister’s waist, she softened slightly.

“It must be Cold Autumn Cicada! She hasn’t awakened yet,” Luo Tian sighed, not wanting to awaken her. He didn’t know how to face Cold Autumn Cicada.

Meanwhile, a woman and two men stood behind the other three elders. Their gazes carried disdain toward Luo Tian and Ren Hongzhi, their auras sending a shiver down Luo Tian’s spine.

These two men were likely Xi Tong and Meng Cheng, the Wen Xin Sect’s prodigies. As for the woman, Luo Tian didn’t recognize her. Ren Hongzhi’s group hadn’t provided any information about this woman either.

However, Luo Tian also noticed a Xian Gu Dao Order on the woman’s body—specifically, the main token of the Xian Gu Dao Order. This made Luo Tian take her seriously.

“Unexpectedly, it’s you!” The woman’s appearance was plain, but upon locking eyes with Luo Tian, her gaze turned playful.

“You!” Sensing Luo Tian’s disregard for her, Ye Wende’s face flushed. Then seeing the disciples’ doubtful gazes, he felt even more humiliated.

Ye Wende and Meng Cheng were evenly matched. One excelled in physical strength, the other in spiritual energy—each had their strengths. Clearly, Ye Wende was the latter.

“You don’t dare to underestimate me! If you can withstand my move, I’ll admit defeat!” Ye Wende roared, his hands shifting. His gaze carried intense anger. A terrifying aura radiated from his hands, causing the Wen Xin Sect disciples’ faces to show hope.

“Ah? A martial technique?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly as he gazed at Ye Wende.

“Chong Xu Yin (Impulse of the Void)! One strike to the heavens!” Ye Wende roared, and three types of spiritual energy converged into his sky. A swirling vortex formed above him.

“Martial technique fusion?” Ye Wende’s face bore a slight shock. He himself had remarkable talent in martial techniques, and now seeing their fusion, he was astonished.

“Hun…,” Ye Wende’s shock didn’t stop his hands. His gaze was filled with seriousness as he looked at the swirling vortex in the sky.

“This is… a Heaven-level martial technique!” The Wen Xin Sect disciples’ eyes widened with fear, gazing at the massive vortex. It seemed to drain all spiritual energy from the world.

“Boom…,” thunderous sounds echoed within the vortex, reminding Luo Tian of the storm that nearly killed him at Ji Feng Valley’s outskirts. Ye Wende’s technique felt as powerful as that storm, if not more.

“Condense!” Ye Wende’s face bore a slight arrogance. This was his strongest technique, used only once against Li Menglian.

As Ye Wende’s voice faded, the swirling vortex in the sky slowly shrank.

“Hun…,” a humming sound pierced through the sky, causing people to instinctively cover their ears.

Hearing this, Jiang Yuanbai and the other four elders furrowed their brows slightly. They extended their hands to reinforce the barrier surrounding Luo Tian and others, preparing to intervene if necessary. After all, such a terrifying technique could not be easily survived by Luo Tian. If something happened to him, there would be no way to explain it to Siku Chen.

Thinking of Siku Chen, that terrifying madman, Jiang Yuanbai’s lips twitched slightly.

“Kai Tian (Opening Heaven)!” Luo Tian roared, not pushing out the Huang Ji Yin but instead summoning Kai Tian Yin again.

A golden seal appeared in the sky, radiating immense pressure. People’s gazes turned to Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian’s two martial techniques are quite good, both at the high-level of Earth-tier. But compared to Ye Wende’s all-out Chong Xu Yin, they still fall short,” one elder spoke, his gaze filled with admiration.

At this moment, Ye Wende’s Chong Xu Yin was almost fully formed. The massive vortex had been compressed to a hundred feet in size, but the pressure it emitted was terrifying. The Wen Xin Sect disciples felt fear.

“Hun…,” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly. He didn’t attack Ye Wende but instead summoned another seal above his head.

“Even if I merge three techniques, I won’t be able to defeat you!” Luo Tian roared. He hadn’t expected Ye Wende to master a Heaven-level technique.

Luo Tian’s hands slowly approached each other. Above him, the Huang Ji Yin and Kai Tian Yin also gradually moved toward one another. Thunderous sounds echoed above Luo Tian’s head.

“Three martial techniques fused! My heavens, what did I just witness!” The Wen Xin Sect disciples exclaimed in shock. Even Jiang Yuanbai and the other four elders widened their eyes, gazing at Luo Tian.

Chapter 631: Destroying Heaven and Earth

Chapter 631: Destroying Heaven and Earth

“Three martial techniques fused! My heavens, Zhang Daotian has gone mad!” Everyone’s gazes were slightly stunned. Two techniques fused was already a miracle, but Luo Tian was attempting to merge three—something that seemed impossible.

Regardless of what people thought, Luo Tian did it. And now it appeared to be successful. The Huang Ji Yin and Kai Tian Yin slowly merged together, creating a terrifying pressure that further cracked the void.

“Wow! He actually succeeded!” Ren Hongzhi and his group stared at Luo Tian in disbelief, their faces frozen.

“Three martial techniques fused. I suppose the power should be comparable to a Heaven-level technique, right?” Luo Tian chuckled softly, gazing at Ye Wende’s Chong Xu Yin. His eyes narrowed slightly.
