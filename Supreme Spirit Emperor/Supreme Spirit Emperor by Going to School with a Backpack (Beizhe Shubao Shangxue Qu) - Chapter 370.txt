"Break into the Origin Domain!" The humans roared, causing the ancient myriad clans to finally display fear.

Originally expecting the ancient myriad clans to crush the humans, no one anticipated this outcome. The ancient king's offspring fell, as did a peak immortal and even a准王.

The dozens of peak immortals trapped within the Broken Realm also bore expressions of fear, gazing at Ji Jiu You, who stood hunched and clad in tattered robes. They too had not foreseen this result.

First was Gu Tian Shu, then Dong Bo Xin, and now Ji Jiu You—three figures once revered by all. They had subdued countless准王 and peak immortals, an outcome that filled people with terror.

"Ahh..." The six准王 restrained by Gu Tian Shu and Dong Bo Xin displayed madness, their bodies stained with blood. Each attack from the two was met with caution; a single lapse would result in injury.

"Roar..." Knowing their fate had turned, the few准王 broke free from Gu Tian Shu and Dong Bo Xin, flying toward the several royal weapons above the myriad clans. They knew if they didn't fight desperately, the ancient myriad clans would be annihilated and never recover.

"Buzz..." The power of the epoch swept across, as six准王 activated their royal weapons, emitting powerful waves. The few准王's faces showed madness.

"Human race, don't force us! We'll destroy everything!" The few准王 shouted loudly, their gazes fixed on Gu Tian Shu, Dong Bo Xin, and Ji Jiu You—three peak immortals of the human race.

"Kill!" But when the humans turned desperate, it was terrifying. The few准王's words clearly carried a compromise, threatening with royal weapons.

"Irrelevant," Ji Jiu You spoke softly, gazing at the few准王 with deep eyes. Gu Tian Shu and Dong Bo Xin stood on either side of him.

"Negotiation!" Hearing Ji Jiu You's words, everyone bore expressions of disbelief, their gazes fixed on the three peak immortals.

The humans' advantage was overwhelming. If a battle erupted, the ancient myriad clans could not withstand it. Given the hatred between humans and the ancient myriad clans, if it were the ancient clan's turn to negotiate, they would never choose this path.

"If we continue fighting, blood will flow rivers!" Ji Jiu You sighed softly, gazing at the dense human forces, his eyes showing a touch of pity.

Hearing Ji Jiu You's words, the humans fell silent. He was right; if a battle truly erupted, epoch treasures and royal weapons would be used. With准王-level beings activating royal weapons, the collision would unleash apocalyptic power. Except for epoch peak immortals, few in both human and ancient myriad clans would survive.

"We still can make concessions. Yield the Thunder Domain and the Mortal Domain for the ancient myriad clans to reside, but they must not enter other domains!" Ji Jiu You spoke softly, revealing the pre-arranged result with Dong Bo Xin and Gu Tian Shu.

Dong Bo Xin and Ji Jiu You hadn't appeared with Gu Tian Shu to intimidate the ancient clan. If they had shown up from the start, even if negotiations were initiated, the ancient clan would never comply. In the future, they might resort to underhanded tactics.

As Gu Tian Shu had previously said, one needed to carve out a qualification by terrifying the ancient clan.

It seemed the three had achieved their goal. The deaths of several peak immortals, one准王, and two ancient king's offspring would keep the ancient clan subdued for a while. This period was also the best time for human development. With the great changes in heaven and earth, humans' current strength would allow them to cultivate more powerful individuals.

Moreover, who knew if the ancient clan still had any准王 left? If those nearing their lifespan准王 emerged, even Gu Tian Shu and the others might not be able to stop them.

"Besides, our era has passed. This era belongs to the youth; we shouldn't interfere," Ji Jiu You spoke softly, scanning over Lu Tian and others.

Hearing Ji Jiu You's words, the准王 of the royal clan fell silent. Though his words seemed reasonable and divided two domains for the ancient clan, it still restricted their freedom.

"Good!" At this moment, Ji Jiu You, Gu Tian Shu, and Dong Bo Xin were too powerful for the ancient clan to resist. They could only agree and plot other strategies.

As Ji Jiu You and the others had anticipated, the ancient clan still had methods. However, those were their foundations; if used, it would severely weaken the ancient clan.

"Then take care of yourselves," Ji Jiu You sighed longingly, then nodded to the ancient clan's准王.

"Go back!" Gu Tian Shu and Dong Bo Xin spoke to the human forces, ending this war.

The humans gazed at Ji Jiu You, Gu Tian Shu, and Dong Bo Xin with fiery eyes. Naturally, they would not defy their words. This invasion by the myriad clans was entirely turned around by these three. Without them, humans' current strength would have been crushed by the ancient clan.

"Go home!" Gu Tian Shu chuckled, addressing Lu Tian and others from the Four Sacred Star Domains, then took a step forward toward the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Home!" Lu Tian's soul emerged from Zhong Li Tian's body, sending the body to Zhong Zi Xuan's side. After all, this unparalleled body belonged to someone else's father; he couldn't keep it forever.

The leaders of the great sects also rose, collecting their epoch treasures and bowing respectfully to Ji Jiu You and Dong Bo Xin before flying toward their respective star domains.

Not long after, the Thunder Domain was left with only the ancient clan's people. The few准王 bore exhausted expressions, gazing at the humans' departure and sighing longingly.

"This result is acceptable. There will be a long period of peace ahead. At least, you have someone who has become a准王 to start the war. The most important thing is to attain kingship!"

The elder of the Crimson Bird Clan gazed at the royal clan's prodigies, then turned and entered the Thunder Domain.

Chapter 1479: A Peaceful Era

Hearing the Crimson Bird准王's words, Fu Xingyue and other prodigies' faces turned grim. Even the ancient king's offspring wore a bitter smile, recalling Lu Tian, Zhong Zixuan, and Xuan Yu's previous invincible prowess, feeling a heavy heart.

"It's too hard!" Fu Xingyue stood in the Star Moon Divine Clan, sighed longingly, and shook his head. It was a tragedy to be born in this life alongside Lu Tian.

"Still, one must attain kingship!" Other prodigies took a deep breath, their gazes determined. Their mindset was not afraid of setbacks; even if they suffered a temporary defeat, they would not lose heart. This was the mindset of true prodigies.

"Go," the ancient clan's people sighed longingly. They knew this was the best result. Unless the royal clan produced a powerful immortal who could match Gu Tian Shu and others.

"We still have ancient king's offspring not yet revealed. We haven't completely failed!" However, the ancient clan soon recalled those still unemerged ancient king's offspring, who had become their spiritual hope.

As the humans returned to their respective star domains and the ancient clan entered the Thunder Domain, the Nine Domains gradually calmed down. The ancient clan indeed kept their promise, with many准王 disappearing from people's sight.

The few准王 had only activated the transmission arrays between the Thunder and Mortal Domains before never appearing again. The ancient clan also did not appear in other domains.

Although the war had completely calmed down, it had swept across the Nine Domains. The names of Ji Jiu You, Gu Tian Shu, and Dong Bo Xin were thoroughly spread among people. After all, the human race had produced such supreme strength, which greatly inspired people.

Lu Tian, Zhong Zixuan, and Xuan Yu's names also soared to prominence. After all, they had confronted the clan's准王-level strength at the epoch peak level, a feat that would be passed down through generations.

Lu Tian was even hailed as the top prodigy of the Nine Domains. This was not just an acknowledgment of his strength but also a recognition of Lu Tian himself. After all, every time the Nine Domains faced great calamities, Lu Tian's figure had appeared. He first saved the day by killing the Mortal Domain's epoch peak immortal, Ming Haoyan. Second, he had blocked the ancient clan's attack.

In the Four Sacred Star Domains, in the Five Elements Sect, people who had returned rested for a day before becoming lively. The top immortals from all domains gathered in the Four Sacred Star Domains, as Ji Jiu You, Gu Tian Shu, and Dong Bo Xin had returned with Lu Tian.

However, people soon became disappointed. Ji Jiu You, Dong Bo Xin, and Gu Tian Shu did not appear, obviously keeping their promise. Even Zhong Zixuan and Xuan Yu, both epoch peak immortals, disappeared from people's sight.

But they still paid their respects to Lu Tian. After all, if the epoch peak immortals did not appear, then these people would become the power of this era.

It seemed like the end of an era, with some powerful people disappearing from sight. The Nine Domains finally fell into a peaceful age.

Yet, the human race still felt a sense of crisis. The ancient clan's strength exceeded people's imagination. This current situation was hard-earned by Gu Tian Shu and the others.

In the Four Sacred Star Domains, after a day of silence, it plunged into revelry. The previous invasion by the myriad clans had kept everyone on edge.

Not only in the Four Sacred Star Domains, but also other domains and many sects celebrated. The entire Nine Domains seemed to plunge into a frenzy.

This atmosphere lasted for seven days before gradually calming down. Then people began discussing the various brilliant individuals who had emerged during this war, as if they could foresee a future where these talents would vie for the position of attaining kingship. That would be true competition.

"Who do you think will attain kingship, Gu Zǔ and Dong Bo Xin?" In the Four Sacred Star Domains, Lu Tian and others sat in a hall chatting. Zheng Xin couldn't help but ask.

Hearing Zheng Xin's question, everyone's eyes brightened. Gu Tian Shu and Dong Bo Xin had strong vitality, and they were already准 epoch masters in this era. It was possible they could attain kingship.

"If Gu Zǔ attains kingship, that would be great!" Lu Tian chuckled lightly. He didn't care who attained kingship, but if it were the ancient clan's prodigies, then humans would inevitably face another catastrophe. His family and friends would surely be caught in the war again.

"To protect their safety, one must keep growing stronger. The ancient clan will never be obedient. Though they are currently weak, if someone attains kingship, they will definitely suppress humans."

Lu Tian thought to himself with a determined look.

"Right now, Gu Zǔ has killed the ancient myriad clans. In the future, I can too!" Lu Tian whispered, then smiled and joined the others in their revelry.

Time flowed slowly. Another seven days passed. The human race's Nine Domains gradually calmed down, returning to normal life. However, the entire human race's spirit for cultivation was even more vigorous. After all, the ancient clan always loomed like a sharp thorn in humans' throats, who knew when it would erupt.

During these days, Lu Tian was quite relaxed, spending time with his two wives and a group of children. Life felt lively.

But not long after, the chatty children also disappeared from the Four Sacred Star Domains, taken by Gu Tian Shu.

That day, Lu Tian, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sxi sat on a mountain peak, serene. Their gazes looked into the distance, unusually peaceful.

"Tomorrow we're going, right? We'll accompany you!" Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi leaned on Lu Tian's shoulder, their eyes filled with concern.

"Yes, we'll leave tomorrow. This time it's not anywhere else; I have the Thousand Mirage Mask to hide my identity, so you don't need to worry about my safety!" Lu Tian sighed longingly. He didn't want his two wives to take risks again.

The Nine Desolate Lands, Lu Tian had already explored most of them. Only the Star Roaming Domain and the Shura Domain remained unvisited.

"Previously, Xuan Yu had sensed Qian Xue and Meng Ru in the Divine Beast Ancient Cave. However, they were eventually pushed out of the cave. Xuan Yu had heard that they would go to the Mortal Domain, so my first destination is the Mortal Domain!" Lu Tian spoke softly. The Mortal Domain was now under the ancient clan's control, and he would infiltrate it secretly. He couldn't let the two women take risks again.

"Besides, what's my current strength? In the late epoch stage. With no epoch peak or准王-level beings around, who could be my opponent!" Lu Tian's eyes showed confidence as he spoke to Jiang Sxi and Leng Qiuchan.

"Yes, we'll wait for you to return!" The two women nodded gently. They understood Lu Tian's thoughts and gave a soft nod.

"But tonight, you have to listen to us!" Jiang Sxi smiled mischievously and grabbed Lu Tian, disappearing from the mountain peak.

The next morning, Lu Tian slowly got up. His face was gentle as he kissed Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi, then appeared outside the room.

"First, I'll visit the Fire Domain to pay respects to Grandfather Gu!" Lu Tian whispered to himself and took a step forward toward the Fire Domain.

Lu Tian's current strength allowed him to move at incredible speed. Half a day later, he reached the Infinite Flame Sea.

With Xiao Qi's departure, the temperature of the fire sea had dropped significantly. However, it still felt terrifying.

"Ugh..." A series of discontented sounds rose in Lu Tian's mind, making him smile.

"Okay, okay. I'll let you out!" Lu Tian waved his hand, and Xiao Qi's seven-color hair bun appeared beside him. His eyes showed excitement.

At the moment Xiao Qi appeared, the furious fire sea trembled, causing the people in the Fire Domain who were refining elixirs to be surprised.

"Ah..." Xiao Qi opened his mouth, drool flowing out. He gazed at the scattered fire sea and took a deep breath.

Red flames transformed into a long red dragon, flying toward Xiao Qi's mouth. The people refining elixirs in the fire sea looked at him with anger.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Due to Xiao Qi's inhalation, the temperature changed. A series of furnace explosions rose in Lu Tian's ears.

"Ugh..." Lu Tian grimaced, watching Xiao Qi continuously absorbing the red flames. He heard a series of angry voices.

"Who is it? I'll definitely kill him!"

"My god, how come the flame temperature has dropped a level!" Some were shocked while others shouted. A series of angry voices rose in Lu Tian's ears, flying toward his direction.

"Who are you? How dare you so openly take the flames!" People saw Xiao Qi devouring the flames and immediately became scared. They were too frightened by Xiao Qi's presence, but some still shouted questions.

"Sorry, my child needs flames for cultivation. I'll compensate you for the loss. You can report your losses to me, then go to the Fire Domain's Tongtian Sect. I'll compensate you there!" Lu Tian didn't want to cause trouble, so he put on the Thousand Mirage Mask before people arrived and concealed his true identity.

"Tongtian Sect?" Hearing Lu Tian's words, people fell silent. Tongtian Sect was so powerful in the Fire Domain now; they naturally knew.

"Cut it out. You know people from Tongtian Sect, what's your name? I've never seen you!" However, a voice of contempt rose in Lu Tian's ears. He sighed lightly.

"Never mind!" Lu Tian sighed, these people had the highest cultivation of only the Superficial Stage. He didn't want to cause a commotion, so he reached out and took the storage bag from the young man's waist.

"I'll just return them to you!" Lu Tian smiled, then moved his hands. Storage bags and rings appeared in front of him.

Chapter 1480: Simultaneous Elixir Refining

"What's going on!" People surrounding Lu Tian looked shocked. They hadn't expected Lu Tian to skillfully take their storage bags and rings.

"Met a peak immortal!" Next moment, people felt fear. Especially the young man who had previously mocked Lu Tian turned pale.

"Is he really from Tongtian Sect?" People were puzzled. They immediately realized Lu Tian's identity was definitely not simple.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The sound of explosions rose as each storage ring and bag burst open in front of Lu Tian, a pile of items falling onto the ground.

These people were mostly disciples from Fire Domain sects who had come here to refine elixirs. So they rarely carried other things besides herbs and elixir cauldrons.

However, some had brought a lot of other items. A pile of scattered things appeared in Lu Tian's spiritual sense.

A vast spiritual sense swept over, but soon Lu Tian's face turned strange. His mouth twitched and he quickly withdrew some spiritual senses, as if struck by lightning.

Without Lu Tian's spiritual sense control, the item fell from the sky and appeared in people's sight.

"What is this..." People immediately saw the falling item, their faces turning red and pale alternately.

"Is it a woman's undergarment?" People felt uneasy, looking at the items falling from the sky and then at Lu Tian.

"Whose storage ring is this?" People immediately searched for the source of the falling items, as none of them were women. Obviously, someone had a strange habit, causing people to feel cold.

"This is Ding Xichun's storage ring!" People immediately found out who it was by following the direction of falling items. Because elixir cauldrons usually had their names carved on them.

Everyone's eyes were fixed on that young man, looking at him with contempt. Even his companions looked down on him. This was the young man who had previously mocked Lu Tian.

"I said, why has Miss Li been so upset about losing things lately? It turns out..." Fellow disciples from the same sect as the young man discussed, looking at him with disdain.

"I... " The young man named Ding Xichun turned red. He wished to find a hole to crawl into, no longer having the face to stay. He turned and fled towards the distance.

Lu Tian smiled, though he felt a little uncomfortable. He didn't care about the young man fleeing. In cultivation circles, such things were common; many people had special habits.

"Boom... Boom..." A number of elixir cauldrons appeared instantly in front of Lu Tian, making his eyes show a touch of nostalgia.

"It's been a while since I refined elixirs. Let me practice!" Lu Tian whispered to himself, looking at the two or three hundred elixir cauldrons before him. Then he moved his hands.

A series of hand shadows extended from Lu Tian's front, and the Thousand-Page Elixir Refining Technique was unleashed. Then a series of herbs were placed into each elixir cauldron at an incredible speed.

"My god, is he going to refine elixirs?"

"How could it be? One person refining hundreds of elixirs at the same time!" People saw Lu Tian's actions and looked shocked.

"Fast, what technique is this!" People watched the series of hand shadows placing herbs into the cauldrons and exclaimed.

"What's terrifying isn't his technique, but his spiritual sense. With so many herbs, he could precisely find them. How terrifying must this spiritual sense be!" People looked at Lu Tian with expressions of disbelief, as his actions were beyond their comprehension.

Under people's shocked gazes, herbs were perfectly distributed into each cauldron by Lu Tian.

Time flowed slowly. It took nearly an hour for Lu Tian to place the herbs into the cauldrons.

"Boom... Boom..." The lids of each cauldron fell onto them. Lu Tian's face still held a smile as he waved his hands, grabbing the endless fire sea fiercely.

The fire sea roared. A series of fire dragons formed instantly in Lu Tian's hands, flying toward the cauldrons and entering their mouths.

"Ugh..." A series of humming sounds rose from each large cauldron, making the people watching look tense. Their eyes were fixed on their own cauldrons as if witnessing a miracle, for Lu Tian's actions were too shocking.

Refining two or three hundred elixirs at the same time, this had never been heard of before. Everyone wanted to see if Lu Tian could succeed.

"A great opportunity!" Everyone's hearts were filled with joy. They had encountered a great opportunity, whether it was Lu Tian's technique or his actions. They hadn't expected it could be done this way.

Time passed another hour, and the fragrance of herbs rose from the cauldrons. Even the terrifying fire sea couldn't suppress this rich herbal aroma.

"Refining the elixirs!" People's faces were tense, amazed by Lu Tian's refining speed. This was the final test.

"Buzz..." Lu Tian moved his hands, sending a series of imprints from his hands into each cauldron. They disappeared from people's sight.

"Boom... Boom..." A series of dark clouds rolled over everyone's heads, lightning surged, as if preparing for a terrifying attack.

"It's an elixir refinement thunderstorm! That means this elixir is at least a ninth-grade elixir!" People looked fearfully at the dark clouds in the sky, feeling the terrifying pressure. Even the terrifying fire sea was suppressed.

"Open!" Lu Tian roared, an invisible wave of energy radiated from his body and struck the cauldrons.

The booming sound echoed. The lids of each cauldron were blown open, and a burst of light emerged. A rich vitality surged in the fire sea.

"Buzz..." A series of elixirs rose like meteors from the cauldrons, under people's shocked gazes.

"Crack..." At the same time, a series of lightning bolts surged from the thunderclouds, striking each elixir.

"Back!" The next moment, Lu Tian's figure appeared above the numerous elixirs. He looked at the descending thunderstorm and emitted a pulling force.

As the pull was released, those lightning bolts twisted rapidly. They all changed direction and rushed toward Lu Tian.

Lightning flashed. A series of lightning bolts struck Lu Tian's body, and his entire body glowed with light. He faced the furious lightning without fear, as if bathing in it.

"A peak immortal! That's the power of an epoch-level being!" Everyone's eyes showed excitement. They looked at Lu Tian.

Time flowed slowly. Hundreds of lightning bolts continuously struck Lu Tian's body, then gradually faded away.

"Are you full? If you are, it's time to leave!" Lu Tian spoke to Xiao Qi, his eyes showing a touch of tenderness.

"I'm full. I'm full!" Xiao Qi patted his stomach, showing satisfaction. His body grew a little taller and spoke to Lu Tian, transforming into a ball of flame that imprinted on Lu Tian's forehead.

"This is a human-shaped flame! Who is he!" People were completely shocked, unable to believe their eyes. They hadn't expected that the little boy who ate fire was actually a human-shaped flame, something only found in legends.

"Take these elixirs as compensation. Each of you gets one!" A voice filled with laughter echoed in people's ears, bringing them back to their senses.

"Buzz..." Before people could react, those elixirs emitting powerful energy rushed toward each person and landed in front of them.

"Ninth-grade elixir, Buxue Elixir..."

"Ninth-grade elixir, Hui Shen Elixir..." People's eyes showed joy. They looked at the elixirs in front of them and didn't hesitate to collect them.

"What kind of terrifying elixir refinement skill does this person have! One person refining two or three hundred ninth-grade elixirs at the same time, and they are all different!" People's faces showed reverence as they discussed.

"Look at the imprint on these elixirs. This elixir master must have his own mark!" People immediately started talking, observing their elixirs.

However, they found no signs left. This made people sigh in admiration.

The Fire Domain still valued elixir refinement. People revered powerful elixir masters, and Lu Tian's refining process had completely stunned them.

"I also want to become such an elixir master!" Everyone clenched their fists, as if they had a goal.

At this moment, Lu Tian didn't care about what people thought. This was just an incident for him. He had already compensated them, and he didn't want to cause too much commotion. If he really revealed his identity, they wouldn't dare ask for compensation.

While traveling, with Xiao Qi by his side, the two moved at an incredible speed. Before long, they reached the depths of the fire sea and appeared in the small world where Xiao Qi had once stayed.

Under the starry sky, a figure sat cross-legged. His face was calm, as if he had merged with the starry sky.

Around him were several young figures, also sitting cross-legged. Their faces showed determination.

"Okay, that's it for today!" A gentle voice echoed under the starry sky. The central figure slowly stood up, his eyes filled with a smile.

"Ah... I'm so tired. Grandpa, when can we go out?" A restless figure stood up first, his voice filled with impatience.

"Stupid kid. You don't know how lucky you are to have Grandpa teach you!" Lu Tian smiled and appeared in front of the young man, giving him a slap on his head.

Chapter 1481: If You Want to Become an Immortal, First Defy Heaven

"Uncle! You hit me again!" The young man's face showed no resentment, but he stood there obediently.

"Dad..."

"Master..." A group of young figures appeared before Lu Tian, their eyes filled with respect.

"Yes, good. Except for this stupid kid, everyone has improved!" Lu Tian gave another slap to Gu Tianyu's head and smiled.

"Okay, everyone has their own path. We're just here to guide them!" Gu Tian Shu smiled and spoke to Lu Tian, obviously willing to teach these children.

"Yes," Lu Tian nodded. His eyes showed respect and agreed with Gu Tian Shu's words. Therefore, for his disciples and sons, Lu Tian basically took a hands-off approach. Flowers nurtured in a greenhouse were ultimately superficial.

Lu Tian's achievements today were entirely the result of life-and-death battles, entering dangerous places repeatedly and exchanging survival for it. If he hadn't been lucky, he would have died many times.

"Are you going to the Mortal Domain?" Gu Tian Shu spoke softly, as if he knew what Lu Tian was thinking. After all, Xuan Yu had told him about it.

"Yes! I came here to say goodbye to Grandpa. In the Four Sacred Star Domains, I hope Grandpa can take care of it!" Lu Tian bowed and spoke. Entering the desolate lands, he didn't know if he would be trapped. If he was stuck for too long, something might happen.

"Rest assured. I'll intervene if there's a change!" Gu Tian Shu nodded, his eyes showing concern.

"Stay and refine for a few days with me!" Gu Tian Shu then invited Lu Tian to stay for a few days. Naturally, Lu Tian wouldn't refuse. Obviously, being with such an immortal could teach him a lot and also allow him to spend more time with these juniors.

...

"Human beings rely on the earth for survival. The earth relies on the changing seasons of heaven and earth to nurture all things. All things exist with the Dao! The saying goes, 'Man emulates the earth; the earth emulates heaven; heaven emulates the Dao; and the Dao emulates nature!'" Under the starry sky, Gu Tian Shu spoke softly. His voice was imprinted in Lu Tian's mind.

"This is the Forming of the Dao!" Gu Tian Shu spoke softly, his hands moving. His body suddenly expanded, standing like a giant under the starry sky.

"Grandpa!" The young people's faces showed envy, gazing at Gu Tian Shu under the starry sky. However, Gu Tian Shu's words were still quite profound for them at this stage; their cultivation hadn't reached that level yet.

Lu Tian's mind was shaken. Gu Tian Shu's words felt like a series of thunderclaps, shaking Lu Tian's mind. He looked at Gu Tian Shu's towering figure. Each time Gu Tian Shu used this technique, it was breathtakingly impressive. Even Lu Tian felt a sense of inferiority.

Invincible Gu Tian Shu had never lost a battle since his appearance. Even when he was suppressed by the Dao, he had always fought forward relentlessly.

"You understood the three thousand paths of the Dao at the early epoch stage. This Forming of the Dao is simple: it's to perfectly connect the three thousand paths, making them complement and support each other, forming an infinite body of law!"

"As for the attack evolved from the Brahman Attack Technique, you need to deeply comprehend its essence!" Gu Tian Shu spoke softly. He was obviously confident in Lu Tian, as he was his most favored junior.

"Yes..." Lu Tian nodded thoughtfully. It seemed like he understood, but it also seemed like he didn't. He immediately sat cross-legged under the starry sky and began to ponder.

"You kids, don't disturb!" Gu Tian Shu spoke to the few young people. Then he also sat cross-legged under the starry sky, his hands moving constantly. A series of divine laws flew from his hands and surrounded Lu Tian.

"What do you think, Uncle? Will he learn the Forming of the Dao?" Gu Tianyu asked with curiosity, gazing at Lu Tian sitting there.

"It depends on how long it takes. Master will definitely succeed; it's just a matter of time!" Dong Yichen shook his head gently, showing respect.

"He will definitely succeed. I also want to see Master's old man shatter a ancient clan's prodigy! Those clans are too ruthless; they made Grandpa and Master bleed!" Dong Yan'er's face showed excitement. Although she had grown up, she was well-protected and hadn't suffered hardship, maintaining her innocence.

Hearing Dong Yan'er's words, Zimo and others smiled bitterly. Compared to the ancient clan's ruthlessness, it seemed their master and Grandpa were even more ruthless. They had killed the ancient king's offspring, peak immortals, and a准王.

Time flowed slowly. Seven days passed in the blink of an eye. Lu Tian and Gu Tian Shu sat cross-legged under the starry sky, unmoving. However, Lu Tian's aura kept changing. Sometimes it was as gentle as a spring breeze; sometimes it was as cold as ice for ten thousand years. At other times, it was like a sharp sword, its锋芒 exposed.

"Still not done yet!" Gu Tianyu clearly had an impatient personality. He gathered all the "good" traits of his elders and started to mutter, but his voice was low so as not to disturb Lu Tian and Gu Tian Shu.

Another seven days passed. A series of waves finally emerged from Lu Tian's body, and a series of divine patterns slowly gathered on his body. Then, a series of booming sounds emerged from Lu Tian's body.

Golden light flashed. Lu Tian's eyes slowly opened, emitting two piercing glows before returning to calm.

"Forming of the Dao!" Lu Tian's hands formed a seal. A series of divine pattern chains flew from his hands, surrounding his body. If one observed carefully, each divine pattern on the chains carried a power of the Dao and was connected together.

"Boom... Boom..." As Lu Tian's words were spoken, it felt like a series of thunderclaps. His body suddenly expanded.

"Ten zhang... Twenty zhang..." The young people's mouths opened wide. Their lively eyes watched Lu Tian's body expanding.

"Hundred zhang..." It finally stopped at a hundred zhang. Lu Tian's brows slightly furrowed.

"Powerful!" Lu Tian felt like a true giant now, looking down at all beings. His physical strength had undergone powerful evolution.

"Good. He could directly become a hundred zhang on his first attempt!" Gu Tian Shu nodded, his eyes showing satisfaction. He slowly stood up.

"Boom..." Lu Tian smiled and returned to normal size under the respectful gazes of Gu Tianyu and others.

"Forming of the Dao!" Just as Lu Tian had just recovered, a young voice echoed in people's ears. Then the sound of booming returned.

"What's going on?" Gu Tianyu was startled and looked at his side. His eyes showed disbelief.

In front of him, Lu Li's body slowly rose but only reached a height of ten zhang before collapsing and returning to its original form.

"Damn!" Gu Tianyu couldn't help but curse, looking at Lu Li.
