"Master Leng!" The cold voice echoed, and Dong Boxing saw the last scene of his life. A young man wielding a large sword. The black sword's energy cut through Dong Boxing's body like cutting tofu, splitting him in two and beheading him. The sword energy swept across, without any hesitation, colliding with the golden barrier and shattering it before stopping. Boom...

The golden barrier exploded violently, and as it did, the eight people standing at each of its directions collapsed, their bodies emitting a scent of decay.

"Roar..." Eight black vapors shot out from the decaying bodies, rushing toward Luo Tian with a roar.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's face turned pale, his breath coming in heavy gasps. The Ghost Sealing Seal hovered above Luo Tian's head and immediately suppressed the eight powerful ghost energies, making them into nourishment for the Ghost Sealing Seal. Dong Boxing's eyes still showed excitement, then turned to resentment; he wanted to speak but could not utter a sound from his spiritual gate, and slowly fell down.

A complete kill. A complete kill. The Heaven Demon Body Break allowed Luo Tian to be comparable to a mid-stage Immortal King. One strike, "Leng" Master, with strong power and an ambush, had completely killed Dong Boxing.

This time, using "Leng" Master did not drain all of Luo Tian's cultivation; he left three-tenths.

"I will not completely destroy you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, and then he struck again with a sword, completely eliminating Dong Boxing's life force. However, he did not extract his soul.

This method of making someone never be reborn had been used by Luo Tian many times before, but it was always for his enemies.

Although Dong Boxing seemed to be a cruel and evil person, the feud between him and Luo Tian was not significant. Moreover, Dong Boxing's name reminded Luo Tian of a senior, the Elder of the Divine and Demon, Dongbo Xin. Their names were almost identical.

Luo Tian waved his hand and collected the scattered items, then vanished from the spot in a flash.

Flying for half a day, Luo Tian found an unremarkable small mountain.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian pointed his finger and a cave appeared on the small mountain. Without hesitation, he rushed into it.

He casually set up several barriers to seal the cave and sat inside. His eyes showed a hint of joy.

"Great fortune!" Luo Tian muttered softly, the effects of the Heaven Demon Body Break had not yet faded. He began to count his gains.

"An upper-grade immortal artifact, eight in total!"

"That nine-tier immortal pill is also here, along with the seed of an immortality herb and many upper-grade herbs..."

"Two Ghost Valley Seals!" Luo Tian's eyes showed excitement. He waved his hand and took out two Ghost Valley Seals. One came from the two early-stage Immortal Kings, and one from Dong Boxing.

"Adding the Ghost Valley Seal I obtained from Nie Yuntian, I now have four!" Luo Tian waved his hand again and the original two Ghost Valley Seals appeared.

Luo Tian had been busy before, without any opportunity to study. Now he had four of them and hoped for some surprises.

Four Ghost Valley Seals were neatly arranged in front of Luo Tian, emitting a radiant light. They actively converged towards each other.

"Rustle..." Under Luo Tian's surprised gaze, the four Ghost Valley Seals merged into one. Although there were still flaws, it still radiated a powerful aura.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was surprised, waves of energy rose again. A black light burst out and scared Luo Tian back a few steps.

The dark aura revealed a shadow with his hands behind his back, appearing in Luo Tian's view. Although it was just an illusion, it made Luo Tian feel heavy breathing and his eyes showed disbelief because he seemed to have seen this figure before.

"It's him!" The Jade Stone exclaimed, which rarely showed fear.

Demon Mountain. On the mountain where Luo Tian had once cultivated the Dao of Heaven and Humanity, that old man who used the world as a chessboard and people as pieces. At that time, Luo Tian had almost become one of the pieces. The old man who played chess with Heaven and the current old man standing behind the world had the same aura.

"My god, won't I have to be a piece again!" Luo Tian immediately stepped back, his gaze cautious.

"Ghost Valley appears, the world changes!" A low voice echoed. The world trembled and was filled with the upper three realms. This whisper seemed to echo through ancient times in the ears of all people in the upper three realms, causing everyone's faces to change.

"Ghost Valley Seals have been obtained by someone!" The faces of several Immortal Kings changed instantly, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Finished! The person who obtained four Ghost Valley Seals will be doomed!" The entire immortal world was in an uproar.

"If someone obtains four Ghost Valley Seals, they will be hunted. This is because of the saying 'Ghost Valley appears, the world changes,' spoken by a great immortal, the founder of the nine immortal mountains, Ghost Valley Master!"

"Before, many people obtained four or even five Ghost Valley Seals but none survived. They were all killed in their cradle because they were considered a variable of the immortal world!"

The upper three realms immediately started discussing.

"Once someone obtains four Ghost Valley Seals, others who have one can sense their approximate location!"

"Who is so lucky to get this?" Everyone was very curious who had such an amazing luck, and they felt pity for the person who obtained four Ghost Valley Seals, knowing he would face a hunt from the entire immortal world.

Luo Tian was unaware of this. He looked at the illusion standing in the world, not knowing what would happen next.

The old man extended his hand and began to draw on the void. At the moment he was drawing, Luo Tian felt a sharp pain in his back.

It was a spiritual pain. At the same time, complex incantations appeared in Luo Tian's mind.

After drawing for a quarter of an hour, the pain on Luo Tian's back gradually eased. A dark light shone from his back.

After completing the drawing, the illusion disappeared and only a merged Ghost Valley Seal remained in front of Luo Tian.

"Ghost Valley!" Luo Tian wiped the sweat from his forehead. He immediately felt the dark light on his back forming two characters.

"Is it a form of recognition?" Luo Tian muttered softly, recalling the symbols in his mind.

"Earth-Traversal Art!" Luo Tian spoke softly. His body radiated waves and he began to cultivate it, although he did not know what it was. However, he felt that it was something left behind by the Ghost Valley Seal and definitely not ordinary, just like the Ghost Sealing Seal and Beast Sealing Seal.

The art was not difficult to learn. After reciting it twice, Luo Tian felt the extraordinary nature of this Earth-Traversal Art.

"Almost any barrier can be traversed!"

"It's also a martial art that enhances one's movement!" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes showing joy. Just the ability to traverse any barrier was extremely amazing.

"It's worth it, this Ghost Valley Seal wasn't taken in vain!" Luo Tian picked up the Ghost Valley Seal and smiled.

"More than that, this token is also a treasure. It's an artifact. When thrown out, it can kill many people. Although it is a little inferior to me, it's still very good!" The voice of the Jade Stone echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian did not rush to leave but stayed in the cave, waiting for the decline of the Heaven Demon Body Break.

During this time, Luo Tian was not idle. He took out that nine-tier immortal pill and observed it for a while but did not decide to eat it. A seed appeared in Luo Tian's hand, and he activated his cultivation to start cultivating it, wanting to see what kind of immortality herb this was.

The "Wanwu Shengsheng" (All Things Revive) technique spread, and his cultivation power began to be injected into the seed. Waves of vitality came from the nearly withered seed.

Time passed slowly. After one hour of injecting his cultivation, it felt like a cow entering the sea, making Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrow.

Luo Tian's "Wanwu Shengsheng" technique was already very powerful. In the Nine Realms, it could instantly elevate a medicinal herb by hundreds of years.

The rules of the immortal world were suppressed, and this was an immortality herb with flaws. Luo Tian hadn't expected his "Wanwu Shengsheng" technique to produce no reaction after one hour of cultivation.

"There's a change. The gap has become smaller!" After carefully observing, Luo Tian showed a bitter smile. At this rate, it would take him several centuries to complete the cultivation.

"Never mind, I'll do it slowly!" For the next few days, Luo Tian injected his cultivation through "Wanwu Shengsheng" into the immortality herb every day. After seven days, the small gap in Luo Tian's seed had not healed. According to his calculation, it would take another month for the seed to heal.

After seven days of cultivation, the surrounding area of the small mountain where Luo Tian was had undergone a complete transformation. Tall trees stretched towards the sky, and surrounding herbs grew rapidly, radiating vitality. The area within ten thousand feet was unusually noticeable, as if it were two different worlds.

On the seventh day's head, Luo Tian's Heaven Demon Body Break finally failed. A feeling of exhaustion invaded Luo Tian, making him show a bitter smile.

"The Heaven Demon Body Break is indeed amazing, but the aftereffects are very painful!" Luo Tian smiled lightly and sat cross-legged on the ground.

At the moment Luo Tian was sitting cross-legged, two figures arrived outside the small mountain. Two young men wearing long robes and with happy expressions.

"This is where that sky-piercing light column appeared seven days ago!"

"Yes, looking at the surrounding herbs and plants being so lush, there must be a rare treasure appearing!" The two young men arrived at the base of the small mountain, looking at the spiritually vibrant small mountain.

Chapter 2424: Humiliation()

The two young men quickly arrived at the small mountain where Luo Tian was. Their eyes looked at the entire mountain. Luo Tian had previously set up barriers outside the cave.

One of the two young men was at the peak of True Immortal and the other was at the end of True Immortal. Although Luo Tian's barriers were not very good, it was still a bit difficult for the two young men to find them.

"Careless!" Luo Tian, sitting in the cave, could hear their conversation and showed a bitter smile. He had been so focused on cultivating the immortality herb that he had forgotten that "Wanwu Shengsheng" would also nourish the surrounding plants.

"It will take three more days. I hope it goes smoothly!" Luo Tian sighed longingly. This was his weakened period, both his physical body and cultivation were very weak.

The two young men had low strength. In the past, with Luo Tian's strength, he could completely subdue them with one hand. But now it was not possible.

Time passed slowly, and the two young men searched for a day before finally finding Luo Tian's cave.

"This is it. Did you find it? The plants here are the most lush. Starting from this place, the more outward you go, the sparser they become. Only by careful observation can you find it!" A young man in a blue robe spoke, and he started to move the tall grass outside the cave.

The other companion also followed and moved the grass. They quickly found Luo Tian's cave.

"There is someone inside!" The two immediately saw through the barrier that Luo Tian was sitting cross-legged within.

A black barrier wrapped around the cave entrance, blocking the two young men and causing their faces to slightly change.

"Who is this person?" The two became cautious, looking at Luo Tian. At the same time, Luo Tian also saw the two young men.

"Go away..." Luo Tian spoke coldly. His voice carried a powerful pressure that penetrated into the ears of the two young men.

"Immortal!" The two young men's faces broke out in cold sweat and quickly retreated. Although Luo Tian's physical body and cultivation were not at their peak, his soul was still strong enough to intimidate the two.

"Respected elder, I don't know if this is your cave. Please forgive our disturbance!" The two young men spoke, their voices trembling.

"The worst is an Immortal King!" Both of them felt fear. The upper three realms were under the jurisdiction of the nine immortal mountains, but there were still many independent cultivators. People like Dong Boxing and the Bone-Eating Elder were very famous independent cultivators.

Independent cultivators had strange personalities. Some looked down on the nine immortal mountains and refused to join them. Although these two young men were disciples of the nine immortal mountains, if they were killed by an independent cultivator, the nine immortal mountains might have to investigate for a long time. Moreover, even if their mountain helped them seek revenge, what good would it do? They would still be dead. Therefore, some disciples of the nine immortal mountains were cautious towards independent cultivators.

The two young men left the cave entrance, their foreheads sweating profusely. They had retreated more than ten thousand feet away from the small mountain.

"Thank goodness, that person's aura was too strong. That barrier is made of demon energy, so he must be a demon cultivator!" The two young men flew out another hundred miles and finally stopped, far away from Luo Tian's small mountain.

"It's strange. I secretly looked at that immortal's face earlier, and he was very young. Also, there were two blurry characters on the cave!" One of them spoke, his eyes filled with confusion.

"Ghost Valley!" The next moment, the young man's face showed shock and was soon replaced by joy.

"Ghost Valley Heir!"

"It can't be, we have met a Ghost Valley heir!" The two young men exclaimed and looked at each other before they couldn't say anything.

"Send a message to the sect!" After a moment of silence, both spoke at the same time. Their hands were trembling. Finding a Ghost Valley heir was a major achievement for them, and they knew their own worth.

In the Eastern Emperor Mountain, an old man was seated. The old man was a senior of the Eastern Emperor Mountain named Fu Zhihang.

"Buzz..." While the old man was meditating, his jade token emitted waves. This made the old man's eyebrows slightly furrow. The one sending the message was his two disciples.

"Found a Ghost Valley heir!" However, when the old man saw the message, his eyes immediately showed intense light and he stood up abruptly.

"I myself probably can't subdue him!" The old man muttered to himself and did not spread the message but instead transmitted it to his friend Fu Tianliang.

After a few breaths, two figures flew out from the vast Eastern Emperor Mountain and headed towards the Nine Heavens City.

"You two, no matter what, keep an eye on his movements. No need to kill him, just find out where he is!" Fu Zhihang replied to his two disciples.

"This..." The two young men who had found Luo Tian showed a bitter expression. They hadn't expected their master to give them such orders.

"What should we do? He's an immortal!" The two young men felt regretful for sending the message back. They knew their master's temperament well, and if they didn't go, they wouldn't get a good outcome.

The two young men reluctantly returned and came back to the small mountain where Luo Tian was.

At this time, Luo Tian had just stood up and was about to move to another place. Unexpectedly, the two young men returned.

"Why did you come back again?" Luo Tian felt confused in his heart. He had just been so intimidating, and the two small True Immortals would definitely be intimidated.

The two young men quickly arrived outside the barrier. Their legs trembled, and their eyes showed trembling as they looked at Luo Tian inside the barrier.

"Why did you come back?" A cold voice echoed in their ears, almost making them fall to the ground.

"Respected elder, we came to see if you need any help. We can run errands for you!" One of the young men spoke.

Luo Tian looked at their trembling eyes and understood the situation. At the same time, he was also cursing inwardly; these two guys must have found an accomplice.

"It's really the Ghost Valley!" One of the young men spoke, seeing the characters "Ghost Valley" on Luo Tian's back.

"Did my identity reveal itself because of these two characters on my back?" Luo Tian felt the seriousness of the situation. Those who could stay in the upper three realms were either backed by the nine immortal mountains or ruthless independent cultivators. Once they arrived, his barrier might not be able to hold.

"Go away... I don't need it! Don't force me to kill you!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, and a killing intent surged through the barrier, striking the two young men.

The two young men immediately froze in place. They felt their bodies surrounded by a sea of corpses and countless souls crying out.

"Yes, yes!" The two young men really were scared and fell to the ground.

"Respected elder... we can't get up..." The two young men were almost crying, their legs refusing to move due to fear.

"Damn it, I'm so unlucky!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart. He had to scare two True Immortals.

"They're not looking at us anymore!" The two young men felt the pressure decrease slightly.

"It's strange! From the beginning, he told us to go away. Now he hasn't come out of his cave. According to the rules, he should be able to crush us with one hand!" The two young men communicated secretly.

"He has a reason for not coming out. At least, he can't come out now!" The two young men were confused but didn't dare to try.

"Go away already!" Luo Tian looked at the two young men who had recovered and spoke again. He was also getting impatient.

"You said you were bold, try to attack the barrier!"

"Rubbish, why don't you try?"

"Let's attack together. If it really is what we guessed, then we'll gain a lot!" The two young men kept communicating and quickly reached an agreement.

The two young men slowly stood up, cautiously approached the barrier, and looked at it. At that moment, Luo Tian opened his eyes.

"Respected elder, we still want to help you!" One of the young men spoke. The two immediately reached out and hit the barrier.

"Boom..." A True Immortal's attack, although not earth-shaking, was still powerful. Their hands directly hit the barrier.

After hitting it, they didn't think twice and ran away for thousands of feet. They found that Luo Tian hadn't chased them, their eyes showing joy.

"It's really a trick. We're wet from the pants!" The True Immortal peak young man laughed and flew back to Luo Tian's cave.

"Damn it, dare to trick us!" The True Immortal peak young man cursed and reached out again towards the barrier. This time, he used all his strength but was immediately repelled by the barrier and spat out blood.

"You're playing with fire!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, knowing that the other party had figured it out and no longer concealed himself but spoke coldly.

"Play with fire, what can you do?" The two young men continued to attack the barrier without stopping.

"Old man, if you have guts, come out and fight! We'll definitely make you run away!" The two young men felt excited.

"The Ghost Valley Seal, if we can get it before our master does, our future will be bright!" The two young men became bolder but still couldn't break through the barrier.

"Come on, come out!" The two young men became more anxious and continuously insulted Luo Tian, hoping he would consider the face of an Immortal King and come out.

"Wait, I'll see if you can break through. Once I recover, I will definitely disintegrate you!" Luo Tian smiled coldly and let the two young men attack the barrier. He took out a pill to accelerate his recovery.

Two days passed quickly, and they had insulted for two days. Their mouths were dry and their vocabulary was exhausted but still continued to curse, their faces showing more anxiety. They were worried that Luo Tian might suddenly appear and kill them. However, in their anxiety, they also felt a strange sense of joy, which was very contradictory.

"You'll die very painfully!" Although Luo Tian didn't go out, it didn't mean he wasn't angry.

"Come out and see who kills whom!" The two young men had really enjoyed it. They had never imagined that they could insult an Immortal King and make him silent, and the other party was a Ghost Valley heir.

"Crack..." As the two young men continued to curse and attack the barrier, a crisp sound echoed from Luo Tian's body. A smile appeared on his face.

"Finally... I've recovered!" Luo Tian slowly stood up, and his body vanished from the spot.

"You finally came out..." The two young men saw Luo Tian standing up and showed joy in their eyes. However, the next moment, they felt a slight chill on their necks.

"Chirp..." They were immediately suppressed by a powerful pressure. At the same time, two cold hands grabbed them.

"Respected elder..." One of the young men spoke tremblingly but couldn't continue, as the pressure on his hands made it impossible for him to speak.

"Insulted me for two days. You're the first people who have ever insulted me like this!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of joy, but to the two young men it looked like a demon's smile.

"Tell me, how should I kill you?" Luo Tian didn't rush to kill the two young men but placed them on the ground. His aura suppressed them, making it impossible for them to move.

"Hit yourself in the face. I might let you die painlessly, otherwise I'll have to show you my methods!" Luo Tian pointed his finger and surrounded the two young men with nine-color flames. Two small True Immortals, Luo Tian was very confident he could trap them.

"Smack..." The two young men saw the nine-color flames and trembled. They felt that even their souls would be burned by these flames. Without thinking, they immediately hit themselves.

The two young men really did it and cursed their own mouths. They slapped themselves, and Luo Tian sat there watching them.

Time passed slowly. After slapping for a while, their faces swelled and became like balls but Luo Tian didn't say stop. They dared not to stop.

After three more hours, their heads cracked and blood flowed down from their heads, staining the ground. Boom...

Finally, the True Immortal End young man couldn't bear it and committed suicide, collapsing on the ground.

"Want to commit suicide? It's that easy?" Luo Tian smiled coldly and extended his hand. A wave of energy was sent from his hands, directly capturing the soul of the True Immortal End young man.

"You..." Fear spread. His gray eyes showed disbelief looking at Luo Tian.

He had just committed suicide, and he felt a pulling force that took him away. However, when Luo Tian grabbed his soul, that force mysteriously disappeared.

"Smack... smack..." The True Immortal Peak young man saw this and hit himself even harder.

"Hiss..." Nine-color flames surrounded the young man's soul, slowly burning it. Roars echoed.

While Luo Tian was tormenting the two young men, a breaking sound came from the sky. In his perception, two figures broke through the sky.

"Are they accomplices?" Luo Tian thought coldly and struck them with a palm, instantly killing them. The two young men were annihilated.

Luo Tian had just killed the two young men when two figures appeared in the sky above the small mountain. They saw the scene of the two young men being killed.

"You..." Fu Zhihang was furious. The aura of an early-stage Immortal King instantly enveloped Luo Tian.

"Ghost Valley!" The two immediately saw the "Ghost Valley" characters on Luo Tian's back and showed joy.

A golden hand descended from the sky, splitting the heavens. It directly attacked Luo Tian.

"Eastern Emperor Mountain!" Luo Tian also recognized the identities of the two old men, who were from the Eastern Emperor Mountain.

"Buzz..." He struck with a fist. The golden hand collided with it, and a thunderous sound echoed. The small mountain under Luo Tian's feet was instantly turned into dust.

"Only you two want to kill me?" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed, making Fu Zhihang and his companion feel a sense of danger.

"Where is he?" Then the two felt that Luo Tian was no longer there. Their eyes showed disbelief.

"He's here!" At the moment they were shocked, a black sword appeared behind Fu Zhihang. The dark blade radiated cold light and slashed towards Fu Zhihang.

Fu Zhihang immediately felt a chill on his back. His eyes showed disbelief and he turned around, raising his arm with golden light. He met the black sword descending upon him.

"Crack..." Thunder echoed, Fu Zhihang's body turned into a streak of light and crashed into the ground, creating a deep pit.

"How is this possible!" Fu Zhihang and Fu Tianliang were both shocked. Luo Tian's movement speed was too fast, even they hadn't reacted.

"It's really fun!" Luo Tian felt excited. He had not used the Jade Stone but instead combined the Yellow Spring Steps with the Earth-Traversal Art. The Earth-Traversal Art could conceal Luo Tian's aura when encountering earth-related things, and the dust raised earlier was a cover for him. Combined with the Yellow Spring Steps' originally fast movement, it made Luo Tian's speed reach its peak. He was almost instantly behind Fu Zhihang.

"It really has some skills!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of joy. He struck with a fist towards Fu Tianliang.

Six fists merged, six times the strength of his body. The power was shocking and made Fu Tianliang come out of his shock.

"Eastern Emperor's Finger!" Fu Tianliang shouted and activated his cultivation, striking out with one finger.

"Boom..." A fist met a finger. The thunderous sound shook the eight directions. Luo Tian and Fu Tianliang both retreated, but Luo Tian was overwhelmingly strong while Fu Tianliang's entire arm trembled and blood flowed continuously.

"He! It's Luo Tian!" Fu Zhihang looked at Luo Tian. Upon meeting him, he felt that Luo Tian was familiar but hadn't remembered the image sent out by the Eastern Emperor Mountain.

"I want to see how many early-stage Immortal Kings the Eastern Emperor Mountain has!" Luo Tian smiled coldly and moved towards Fu Zhihang and Fu Tianliang.

"Luo Tian, the one who killed Fu Tianhan and Fu Tiankui!" Hearing Fu Zhihang's words, Fu Tianliang's face also turned grim.

"Run!" Fu Tianliang immediately backed down, knowing about Luo Tian's terrifying record. He flew away from the scene.

"You..." Fu Zhihang's face changed in anger. Fu Tianliang had run, but Luo Tian was heading towards him.

"Buzz..." In an instant, Luo Tian was at Fu Zhihang's front. His black fist continuously struck towards Fu Zhihang.

"Human Emperor Fist!" Fu Zhihang gritted his teeth. He knew Luo Tian's speed was terrifying, and if he ran away, he would definitely not escape Luo Tian's pursuit.

"Only one can be killed!" Luo Tian didn't care. He had already become enemies with the Eastern Emperor Mountain, and he was about to go to the Heaven-Healing Mountain. He didn't mind letting the Eastern Emperor Mountain know he was in the upper three realms.

Golden fists appeared before Fu Zhihang, continuously clashing with Luo Tian's black fists. The thunderous sound continued.

Luo Tian kept striking, pushing Fu Zhihang back and was also surprised by the strength of Fu Zhiang's fists. His body had reached the level of a mid-stage Immortal King, but Fu Zhihang was only pushed back. Even using the "Rapid Wind" technique, it was only enough to make Fu Zhihang spit blood.

Luo Tian was surprised. Fu Zhihang was even more shocked. He knew the power of the Human Emperor Fist, and generally an early-stage Immortal King would be suppressed. However, Luo Tian's unparalleled body strength made each clash cause his blood and qi to shake, and the power was increasing.

"This won't work. I'll be killed!" Fu Zhihang thought to himself. He couldn't escape, and his movement was not as fast as Luo Tian's. Therefore, he could only fight.

"Disrupting Heaven's Decree!" The next moment, Fu Zhihang fought desperately. As he was pushed back by Luo Tian, his hands moved rapidly and golden light came out from his hands. At the same time, Fu Zhihang opened his mouth and spat out two drops of golden blood. These were the heart's blood of Fu Zhihang.

The two drops of golden blood floated up and a golden figure appeared behind Fu Zhihang. The figure held a golden sword, radiating powerful energy. The two drops of blood became the eyes of the figure.

The pressure spread and suppressed the world, and the golden figure seemed to have come back to life. The powerful pressure made Luo Tian stop his body.

"Such a strong Emperor's aura!" Luo Tian's eyes showed seriousness. He looked at the figure raising its golden sword.

"Roar..." The sky trembled, and the golden sword's energy slashed out. It destroyed everything it touched and rushed towards Luo Tian.

"Nine immortal mountains indeed have ancient inheritances!" Luo Tian was serious. His black sword emitted a dark glow and expanded violently, striking the golden sword's energy.

Chapter 2426: Life Sign()

The demonic energy surged, and a wild wave of power came from Luo Tian's body. The demonic energy formed black armor covering Luo Tian's body.

At the same time, a dark demon shadow appeared out of nowhere. The figure was exactly Luo Tian.

Luo Tian held the Long Yuan Sword and did not hesitate, striking down with one sword.

The black sword's energy met the golden sword's energy. Two swords of light, like a world-ending light, emitted a series of explosions. Although it seemed slow, they collided instantly.

The sky collapsed and the winds reversed. The void began to spread outward from both of them, spreading for ten thousand miles. Smoke was sucked into the cracks in the sky.

Luo Tian and Fu Zhihang were hit by this wave of energy, and their two shadows also collapsed.

"I'm not dead!" Fu Zhihang's face was pale. Blood flowed from his mouth, and a deep wound appeared on his chest. One could even see the withered heart that had lost two drops of heart's blood.

"You're not dead either. How could I die!" Luo Tian smiled, and his demonic armor fell off. His chest also had a wound but it was not fatal.

Luo Tian took a step forward, holding the Long Yuan Sword. He looked like a demon emerging from hell and approached Fu Zhihang.

"Pu..." One strike cut off Fu Zhihang's life.

"Eastern Emperor Mountain, Fu Zhihang is dead!" As Fu Zhihang died, people were again shocked. Especially the people of the Eastern Emperor Mountain.

"What happened?" Fu Zhihang's face showed anger. He suddenly stood up, his eyes filled with killing intent.

The Eastern Emperor Mountain now had a severe shortage of Immortal Kings. Three Immortal Kings had died, which was enough to hurt the Eastern Emperor Mountain.

"It's Luo Tian!"

"Luo Tian is a Ghost Valley heir!" When Fu Zhihang was angry, Fu Tianliang sent back the message.

Fu Tianliang was now very anxious. He had just escaped, and Fu Zhihang was killed. Fu Tianliang feared Luo Tian would kill him, so he ran desperately towards the Eastern Emperor Mountain.

"It's also Luo Tian. A Ghost Valley heir!"

"He was always strange, and it turned out he is a variable of the immortal world!" Fu Zhiang's eyes showed coldness.

"Immortality, Medicine King, Heaven-Healing. Luo Tian is a Ghost Valley heir! I am now going to issue the Nine Immortal Mountain's Killing Edict. Do you have any objections?" Fu Zhihang spoke, his voice filled with anger even though he was far away. He still communicated with several Immortal Kings.

"Luo Tian is a Ghost Valley heir!" Hearing Fu Zhihang's words, several Immortal Kings' faces also changed.

"Agreed!"

"Agreed. I will personally go out, since he is in the upper three realms it's easier!" Several responses.

"Now, everyone who can find clues about Luo Tian must report them. We will personally chase him!"

"I and the other mountains have issued the Nine Immortal Mountain Killing Edict!"

"Everyone from the nine immortal mountains, all Immortal Kings must be mobilized and block the Mirage Sea!" A series of authoritative voices spread instantly among the nine immortal mountains.

The terrifying nature of the nine immortal mountains was fully displayed. In a moment, almost everyone in the upper three realms knew this news.

"Nine Immortal Mountain Killing Edict!"

"My god, how many years has it been since it was last used? Not even during the time of the Heart Demon Hermit causing chaos in the immortal world was it used!" The immortal world was again shocked.

Luo Tian's name spread throughout the entire immortal world. It was almost certain death under the Nine Immortal Mountain Killing Edict.

"Ghost Valley heir!"

"It's only a Ghost Valley heir who can have such treatment!"
