"Boom..." Luo Tian fell to the ground in a battered heap, his body feeling as if it had been torn apart.

"Luotian's done for!" Everyone watching the red flames engulfing Luo Tian thought this, for it was the unyielding heavenly fire that consumed all.

"Buzz..." But something strange happened—Luo Tian opened his mouth, and a powerful suction pulled the fiery flames into it.

"What's going on?" Everyone was stunned, except Sun Keinian who stood there with a sneer.

"Cough... cough..." Luo Tian spat out blood, his body emitting crackling sounds as he slowly rose. Two puffs of white smoke escaped his mouth, as if unharmed.

"What the hell is this?" Everyone rubbed their eyes in disbelief, staring at Luo Tian—this man had devoured the mighty heavenly fire.

"Good, burn him to ash? Is Zhu Fengtian's heavenly fire fake?" Zhao Ritian was stunned, his gaze flickering between Zhu Fengtian and the burning Luo Tian. Yet he had felt a strong sense of danger when the fire appeared.

"His body must have an artifact that resists heavenly fire!" Zhu Fengtian immediately noticed the flickering seven-color mark on Luo Tian's forehead.

"Still resisting?" Zhu Fengtian barked, then launched a crimson sword that radiated heat. It sliced through the sky like a venomous snake, aiming to tear Luo Tian apart.

Chapter 1819: Zuo Qiuming Awakens

"Damn..." Luo Tian cursed, summoning his spear. Even if he was overpowered, he had no choice but to fight back.

The golden spear swept through the air, colliding with the fiery sword's aura. Sparks flew everywhere as Luo Tian was forced back, leaving deep footprints in the ground. The red sword's aura sent him flying over ten feet before he crashed into a wall.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's body pressed against the wall, blood spewing from his mouth and staining his chest.

"Luotian hasn't been this helpless in a long time," Sun Keinian observed, recalling how he had never seen Luo Tian so battered. Though Zhu Fengtian was a mid-stage Celestial Immortal, Sun Keinian believed it wasn't a problem for Luo Tian.

"Such a tough bastard!" Zhu Fengtian's eyes flashed coldly as he vanished in a red blur, reappearing before Luo Tian and thrusting his sword toward his throat.

"Out of line!" Just as the red aura was about to strike, Luo Tian raised his hand to block. A deep voice echoed, filled with dominance and pressure. Before it finished speaking, a golden hand pushed down, cutting Zhu Fengtian off.

"Hmm?" Zhu Fengtian's eyes narrowed as he retreated, gazing at the middle-aged man before Luo Tian.

"Zhu Fengtian! How dare you attack a new disciple within the sect!" Zuo Qiuming barked, his gaze scanning Luo Tian's bloodied form and burning with cold killing intent toward Zhu Fengtian.

"Zuo Qiuming?" Zhu Fengtian's brows furrowed upon seeing the middle-aged man. He hadn't expected the Tianlong City Lord to be here, unaware that Zuo Qiuming had already returned to Tianmen Sect.

"Zuo Qiuming, you're the City Lord—how dare you interfere in our sect's matters?" Zhu Fengtian spoke coldly, his tone dismissive. Though Zuo Qiuming held some status in Tianmen Sect, by rules he had no authority over internal affairs.

"Go to hell!" Zuo Qiuming stepped forward, his hand flashing as he slapped Zhu Fengtian across the face.

"Smack!" The sound echoed, and Zhu Fengtian was sent flying, his face twisted. His fiery body extinguished instantly.

"You!" Zhu Fengtian glared at Zuo Qiuming, but before he could speak, a gust of wind rushed in. Zuo Qiuming's foot descended upon Zhu Fengtian's face.

"Zhu Senior Brother is in trouble! Now it should be called Zuo Elder!" People murmured, recalling how Luo Tian had cured Zuo Qiuming's poison. Moreover, Zuo Qiuming's return to Tianmen Sect and eligibility for the Grandmaster position were thanks to Luo Tian.

"Indeed! If his poison wasn't cured, Zuo Lord wouldn't have survived three days. Luo Tian is his savior!" People watched as Zuo Qiuming's foot repeatedly crushed Zhu Fengtian's face.

Zuo Qiuming was truly enraged. He had just awakened and learned from Xuan Dan that Luo Tian had been expelled from the Dan Peak. Without hesitation, he went to fetch Luo Tian from the outer sect. Passing through the Heavy Peaks, he arrived just in time for this scene. Zuo Qiuming could sense Zhu Fengtian's intent to kill Luo Tian, which made him furious.

"Boom... Boom..." Zuo Qiuming's golden foot repeatedly crushed the ground, sending stones flying. Zhu Fengtian was unrecognizable, his head bloodied and faceless.

"Big Brother!" Luo Tian smiled, stopping Zuo Qiuming before he killed Zhu Fengtian. Otherwise, it would be detrimental to Zuo Qiuming.

"Little Brother, are you okay?" Zuo Qiuming finally stopped, approaching Luo Tian with concern.

"Nothing serious. I'll recover in half a day. Congratulations, Big Brother!" Luo Tian smiled.

"Come with me to the Earth Peak!" Zuo Qiuming ignored others, grabbing Luo Tian and leaving.

"Zuo Qiuming, don't go! I'll report to the Grandmaster! A City Lord dare to bully me like this!" Zhu Fengtian, still weak, shouted as he struggled to his feet. His appearance was now a stark contrast to his former self—hairless, faceless, and utterly defeated.

"Ah... Zhu Senior Brother, you're just looking for trouble!" The disciples sighed, pitying Zhu Fengtian's plight.

"Oh? You think I'm looking down on the City Lord?" Zuo Qiuming turned, approaching Zhu Fengtian.

"Buzz..." A wave of energy radiated from Zuo Qiuming's hand, revealing a golden token. It was the token of the Eight Peaks' Elders, marked with a "He" (harmony) symbol—representing the Nine Peaks' token.

"Still, it's fine if you look down on me. Unluckily, I've just returned to Tianmen Sect and become the Elder of He Peak. Moreover, my master was one of the Eight Supreme Elders, and I am also a direct disciple of Tianmen Sect. By all means, I should be higher than you!"

"How...?" Zhu Fengtian was stunned, staring at the token. Though he knew Zuo Qiuming had status in Tianmen Sect, he hadn't expected it to be so prestigious.

"He Peak... hasn't anyone been there for a long time, right? The whole He Peak has been abandoned! Are you trying to revive He Peak?" People murmured, recalling how the disappearance of Long Dao had caused He Peak to decline. Subsequently, its disciples were absorbed by other peaks.

"Moreover, I have the token of the Earth Peak's Supreme Elder. What do you want to do? Go report to the Grandmaster!" Zuo Qiuming waved his hand again, revealing another token.

A murmur spread through the crowd as they stared at Zuo Qiuming's tokens, sensing a dominant aura.

"Respect the Earth Peak Supreme Elder!" The crowd bowed respectfully to the golden token, for it symbolized the presence of the Earth Peak's Supreme Elder. Only nine such tokens existed in Tianmen Sect—eight peaks plus Grandmaster Li Changfeng's.

Zhu Fengtian was utterly stunned, realizing Zuo Qiuming's background was terrifying. His status alone could crush him.

"If I hadn't just returned, I wouldn’t have let this go. He Luo Tian is my brother! From today on, Luo Tian is the..."

"Big Brother!" Before Zuo Qiuming could finish his inner sect title, Luo Tian interrupted him. He didn’t want to enter the inner sect; Tianlong Tomb was a prime location for his dominance over Tianmen Sect.

"He Luo Tian is my brother. Who dares to harm him, must first ask me, Zuo Qiuming!" Seeing Luo Tian's subtle shake of his head, Zuo Qiuming changed his words.

People envied Luo Tian, first favored by Xuan Dan and expelled, now having such a powerful patron.

"Dead!" Zhao Ritian's face darkened, surprised Luo Tian had such a connection.

"He must die! Xuan Dan's direct disciple must be me!" Zhao Ritian's face darkened, making a decision.

"Take these two with you. Do you have any objections?" Luo Tian smiled, approaching Zhu Fengtian and pointing at Sun Keinian and Yu Changtian.

"You..." Zhu Fengtian's face was grim, but he could only pant heavily and say nothing.

"Go!" Zuo Qiuming didn’t know what Luo Tian wanted with them, but he grabbed Sun Keinian and Yu Changtian without greeting Zhu Fengtian. The world was ruled by strength, as Luo Tian had before—without Zuo Qiuming's support, he might have been killed by Zhu Fengtian. At that time, Zhu Fengtian would only face a light punishment while Luo Tian became a pile of earth.

"Okay," Luo Tian nodded, ignoring Zhu Fengtian's trembling form and following Zuo Qiuming as they left.

"Ah..." Zhu Fengtian roared, desperately wanting a patron. If he were a direct disciple, killing Luo Tian would be as easy as squashing an ant. Even Zuo Qiuming wouldn’t dare to act so boldly.

But Zhu Fengtian wasn't even a disciple, let alone an elder. It wasn’t that he couldn’t become one; it was his pride—always eyeing the position of Xuan Dan's direct disciple.

"Zhu Senior Brother, a gentleman takes revenge after ten years!" Zhao Ritian smiled, approaching Zhu Fengtian.

"Zhao Ritian, if you're trying to mock me, you've chosen the wrong person!" Zhu Fengtian clenched his fists, eyes glowing red as he stared at Zhao Ritian.

"Where's the problem? Zhu Senior Brother, we're on the same boat now. I've also attacked him. He definitely knows it's me. So our goals are the same!"

"He has a patron, what can we do?" Zhu Fengtian spoke solemnly, already thinking about finding an elder to apprentice under.

"We can plan long-term. Killing one outer sect member is manageable. If we find some accidents to keep Zuo Qiuming quiet, it'll be fine!" Zhao Ritian whispered to Zhu Fengtian, making his eyes flicker with light.

Chapter 1821: A Healer's Heart

After Gu Qianxue left, the two said nothing. When dawn broke and the ghostly energy vanished, Luo Tian slowly stood up, smiling as he exited the hut. He put on the Thousand Mirage Mask and headed to the market where he had previously gathered information.

"To win the Dan Competition, one must at least reach third-grade immortal alchemist!" Luo Tian muttered. That night, he had planned to win the Dan Competition and improve Xuan Dan's impression of him. As for joining as a disciple, he hadn’t decided yet.

To reach third-grade immortal alchemist, he needed vast quantities of herbs and medicinal materials. Though he had some, it was far from enough.

After an hour of walking, Luo Tian arrived at the bustling market. He found a relatively lively spot and sat down, raising a banner with four big characters: "Alchemist for Hire."

"Who is this?" As soon as Luo Tian sat down, people noticed him. Outer sect disciples were diverse and the lowest in Tianmen Sect—most sought connections to get Dan Peak inner disciples to craft their elixirs.

But when people saw his unfamiliar face, they sneered.

"Big forest has all kinds of birds. He must be crazy for wanting immortal stones! Even alchemy!" Mocking voices echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

"Putting up a stall here is asking for death. He doesn’t know who this place belongs to! Looks like an idiot!" People gossiped about Luo Tian.

"Move aside, what are you all surrounding?" A deep voice echoed from the crowd as a big man pushed through.

"Alchemy?" The big man saw Luo Tian sitting there, stunned. Then his eyes flashed with fury.

"Do you know who this place belongs to?" The big man approached Luo Tian, scrutinizing his face. After seeing he was ordinary, he sneered.

"Unknown. Isn’t this market open to whoever arrives first?" Luo Tian opened his eyes slowly, gazing at the big man with a smile.

"Didn’t you hear of Yu Haonan? I've occupied this spot for a year. I didn't expect an idiot to take it!"

"Three breaths, leave or I'll make you crawl out!" The big man glared at Luo Tian.

"Really asking for death, Yu Senior Brother is a genius about to take the inner sect exam. Daring to offend Yu Senior Brother!" People around flattered Yu Haonan.

"Oh?" Luo Tian smiled, looking at the big man. He hadn’t expected to face trouble so soon, but it suited his plan—his current need was fame.

"What if I don’t leave?" Luo Tian stood up, gazing at Yu Haonan without moving.

"Then I’ll make you crawl out!" Yu Haonan, hearing Luo Tian’s words, exploded with anger. He strode toward Luo Tian and grabbed the white banner to break it in front of him.

"Smack!" As Yu Haonan's big hands were about to grab the banner, a clear sound echoed. A white hand grabbed his arm.

"I don’t like crawling. If you negotiate nicely, I might leave. But you didn’t!" Luo Tian held Yu Haonan's arm with a smile.

"You!" Yu Haonan’s face changed, trying to break free but failing. He was tightly gripped by Luo Tian.

"Good kid!" Yu Haonan realized he had met a tough opponent and roared, kicking Luo Tian.

The leg wind rose, and as Yu Haonan lifted his leg, Luo Tian kicked him in return.

"Crack!" A clear crack echoed, and Yu Haonan's thick leg twisted, breaking with a white bone visible. Blood flowed from the break.

"Thud!" Luo Tian released Yu Haonan's arm, and his body fell to the ground.

"Kicked Yu Haonan’s leg!" People gasped, surprised this unfamiliar idiot was so ruthless.

"That's Yu Haonan, who had completed a year-long mission and finally qualified for the inner sect exam!" People murmured, shocked that Yu Haonan was broken by this man.

"Now, since you like crawling, I'll grant your wish!" Luo Tian smiled, lifting his leg and stomping on Yu Haonan's other leg.

"Yelling...!" A pig-like scream echoed from Yu Haonan, who had no surprise. His other leg also snapped.

"You wait!" Yu Haonan shouted, his face red with sweat and pain. He felt both legs were no longer his.

"You broke my leg's meridians!" Yu Haonan’s eyes flashed with anger.

"Broken!" People's faces showed shock, surprised this seemingly harmless youth was so ruthless as to break Yu Haonan’s legs.

Yu Haonan, with hatred, crawled on the ground, supporting himself with his hands to move away. He knew he had to find a way to recover his legs quickly, or he would be truly broken.

"Ah... Brother Haonan, you're severely injured!" But as Yu Haonan had taken two steps, Luo Tian's voice echoed behind him. He walked over with a smile, but this smile made Yu Haonan feel like the devil was smiling at him.

The crowd was speechless, surprised that Luo Tian had just broken his legs and now said this. What did he want?

"What do you want?" Yu Haonan shivered, unsure if it was fear or pain.

"Nothing special. I just saw your severe injury. If not treated in time, you might never stand again!" Luo Tian rubbed his hands and spoke to Yu Haonan.

"Fortuitously, I have a pill that can heal your legs. Do you need it? The price is good—no haggling, cure all ailments!" Luo Tian waved his hand, revealing a jade bottle. He poured out a grayish pill.

"Your mother, this is a pill!" Yu Haonan glared at the pill in Luo Tian's hand.

"Brother, don’t be deceived by its unimpressive appearance. It’s a second-grade pill that can cure your broken leg—cure all ailments!" Luo Tian handed the pill to Yu Haonan.

"I give up, how much immortal stones? I’ll pay! Just let me go!" Yu Haonan knew Luo Tian might be extorting him, but he had no choice. He reluctantly bought it.

"Cheapest, one hundred immortal stones!" Luo Tian spoke softly, counting his fingers.

"Your mother, it's so expensive!" Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Yu Haonan felt his heart bleeding. One hundred immortal stones—though he could afford it, for him it was a big expense. One hundred immortal stones were enough for an inner sect disciple to have one second-grade immortal elixir crafted.

"Okay!" Yu Haonan gritted his teeth, vowing to make this man pay when his legs recovered.

Yu Haonan gritted his teeth, waved his hand, and handed Luo Tian a storage bag with one hundred immortal stones. But he didn’t take the pill, thinking Luo Tian was just trying to extort him. The grayish pill looked unappetizing, and he wouldn’t even eat it for free.

"Haha, Brother Haonan is truly discerning!" Luo Tian grabbed the storage bag, counted it, then put the pill back in Yu Haonan’s hands.

"Can I go now?" Yu Haonan's face was pale, blood from his legs staining the ground.

"Of course! But Brother Haonan, you must take this pill. If not treated, it might leave lasting effects!" Luo Tian saw Yu Haonan didn’t take the pill and spoke.

"No!" Yu Haonan coldly replied, then pushed his arms to move away from the crowd.

"Brother Haonan, what do you mean? I’m running a legitimate business. If you don’t eat it, you’re looking down on me!" Luo Tian didn’t want to waste this good publicity. He stepped forward again, standing before Yu Haonan.

"What do you want from me?" Yu Haonan nearly cried, having already paid one hundred immortal stones. Was it not enough?

"Brother Haonan, I’m doing this for your good. I am an alchemist. Healers have a parent’s heart; how could I harm you?" Luo Tian smiled with compassion, like a true healer.

"Never seen such shameless people!" People watching Luo Tian’s actions secretly cursed him, as Yu Haonan's legs were clearly his handiwork.

"Quickly eat it, or it’ll be too late!" Luo Tian waved his hand, raising the unattractive pill.

"Refuse! My mother, I can’t eat things given by others!" Yu Haonan was truly scared. He feared eating this pill and dying mysteriously.

"…" Luo Tian was speechless, looking at Yu Haonan then his legs, frowning slightly. "I really am doing this for your good!"

With that, Luo Tian knelt down and forcibly stuffed the pill into Yu Haonan’s mouth. He knew if he delayed, his legs would be beyond repair.

"Done... this man must want to kill me silently. I just wanted my spot back!" Yu Haonan couldn’t resist, and Luo Tian forcibly灌进了 his mouth.

Chapter 1822: Absorbing Ghost Energy

"Done... I’m going to die!" Waves of energy surged into Yu Haonan’s body, making his face pale.

"Buzz..." But a moment later, Yu Haonan felt warm all over, his broken legs itching intensely.

"Ah..." Yu Haonan screamed, as if thousands of ants were crawling on his legs.

"Such a pity..." People felt compassion, surprised that the previously bullying Yu Haonan was now so pitiful.

"Hmm?" After screaming, both Yu Haonan and the surrounding crowd were stunned, gazing at his legs surrounded by green light.

"My legs..." Yu Haonan suddenly realized, though it was itchy, they had sensation.

"Next time, be careful!" Luo Tian smiled, then ignored Yu Haonan and returned to his seat, closing his eyes.

"What's going on?" Everyone stared at Yu Haonan’s legs wrapped in green light, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Visually, Yu Haonan's legs healed rapidly, quickly returning to normal.

"Done..." Yu Haonan stood up, moving his legs. Though the immortal energy flowed slowly, it didn’t hinder his walking.

"Rest for three or five days and you’ll recover!" As people were stunned, Luo Tian’s lazy voice echoed.

"Show-off!" Luo Tian knew he needed to show off, the more like a sage, the more people would believe he was a real alchemist.

"Master, you are the master! Can you sell me some more of your pills?" Yu Haonan immediately became excited, gazing at Luo Tian. He was stunned by the pill's effect; even inner sect disciples couldn’t craft such a potion.

"Master, you really do alchemy?" Yu Haonan gazed at Luo Tian, no longer with his former aura. His face was respectful toward Luo Tian.

"Second-grade elixirs can be crafted, third-grade elixirs have uncertain success rates. Five portions of herbs and medicinal materials for second-grade, no haggling!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

"Expensive..." People's first thought was expensive. Luo Tian’s pricing was even higher than inner sect disciples.

"Why don’t you rob? Inner sect seniors only need four portions of herbs for second-grade elixirs, but you ask for five!" People smiled coldly.

"However, the first customer gets a discount—only three portions!" Luo Tian then gazed at Yu Haonan.

"Can you craft a broken immortal elixir?" Yu Haonan furrowed his brows, speaking to Luo Tian. He felt the difference in Luo Tian’s elixir; after taking it, his cultivation had slightly loosened, hinting at a breakthrough to the Celestial Immortal Mid-stage.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded slightly. The broken immortal elixir was a second-grade elixir, the one that allowed breakthroughs from Celestial Immortal Initial to Mid-stage. Luo Tian had also noticed Yu Haonan's one-step breakthrough.

"Master, these are four portions of herbs for the broken immortal elixir. I want to craft one! The extra portion is my apology for bumping into you!" Yu Haonan gazed respectfully at Luo Tian, biting his lip and handing him a storage bag. It was one he had collected with great effort.

Yu Haonan originally planned to beg an inner sect disciple from Dan Peak to craft it, but after taking Luo Tian’s elixir, he felt the difference.

"Broker..." People saw Yu Haonan and Luo Tian, feeling a sense that Yu Haonan was this man’s broker.

"Good... come back in three days to get the elixir!" Luo Tian nodded, taking Yu Haonan’s herbs without hesitation.

"This must be an inner sect disciple from Dan Peak disguised to show off, otherwise how could he be so powerful!" Yu Haonan thought about Luo Tian’s identity.

"Master, can I have your address? I’ll visit to apologize!" Yu Haonan spoke softly, making others curious about this unfamiliar youth's identity.

"No, come back in one day to get the elixir!" Luo Tian directly refused, his eyes showing anger.

"Yes, yes..." But Luo Tian’s actions made Yu Haonan more certain that Luo Tian was an inner sect disciple from Dan Peak.

"I also want to craft an elixir!" As Yu Haonan and Luo Tian spoke, more voices echoed in the crowd. These were people who hadn’t connected with inner sect disciples.

Though Luo Tian’s pricing was higher, it still allowed them to get elixirs. They were willing to spend a few more herbs.

Luo Tian naturally didn’t refuse, taking the herbs from these people and preparing to leave.

"Everyone, come back in one day to get your elixirs. I guarantee value for money!" Luo Tian smiled, believing that after these people received his elixirs, his business would attract a flood of customers.

"Such a lot of brokers!" People looked down, thinking Luo Tian and Yu Haonan were colluding to deceive people.

Luo Tian ignored others’ thoughts, leaving the crowd and heading toward his hut.

With Yu Haonan’s precedent, no one dared to bother or follow Luo Tian. After walking an hour and carefully turning several corners, he found no one following him, then headed toward his hut.

"Haha..." As Luo Tian hadn’t reached the hut yet, laughter echoed in his ears.

"What's so funny?" Luo Tian pushed open the door and saw Sun Keinian laughing like a madman.

The thatched hut was covered with yellow talismans, each marked with various symbols. Waves of energy radiated from the talismans.

"Unknown, he’s been laughing for a while. If it weren’t daytime, I’d think he was possessed by ghosts!" Yu Changtian looked at Sun Keinian’s foolish laughter with a strange expression.

"Luo Tian, you’re back! I’m truly a genius!" Sun Keinian gazed at Luo Tian with pride.

"Did you discover a method to avoid ghosts?" Luo Tian looked puzzled at Sun Keinian.

"No... but it's almost done!" Sun Keinian was excited, then grabbed a golden talisman and waved it.

"Did you see? With this, we can absorb ghost energy to cultivate. As long as we cultivate with ghost energy for a while, our bodies will naturally have some ghostly aura. That way, we can infiltrate!" Sun Keinian smiled proudly.

"Really?" Luo Tian was doubtful, not believing Sun Keinian could achieve this in a day.

"You’re looking down on my great achievement!" Sun Keinian’s eyes flashed anger at Luo Tian's words.

"Fine, make more of them. I’ll go alchemize!" Luo Tian saw Sun Keinian’s eyes and sighed, no longer arguing. He left the courtyard to start alchemy.

"Boom... boom..." As Luo Tian started alchemy, the Tianlong Tomb trembled again. However, since it was far from other outer sect disciples’ accommodations, people didn’t pay much attention.

Time passed slowly; half a day went by quickly, and Luo Tian had three jade bottles in his hands—those he had collected at the market.

"The success rate is acceptable!" Luo Tian muttered, taking out his share and starting to craft elixirs again.

"Inner sect disciple Zhu Fengtian captured two ascension beings, reward: two lower-grade immortal artifacts and one fifth-grade elixir!" As Luo Tian rested, a deep voice echoed from the peak, spreading across eight directions. The entire Tianmen Sect was stunned.

"Zhu Senior Brother truly is a dragon among men, capturing two ascension beings!"

"My god! Two lower-grade immortal artifacts and one fifth-grade elixir! No wonder inner sect disciples are so crazy!" Everyone was shocked, surprised by the generous reward.

"Xue Lao must have faced a lot of pressure now!" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes filled with gratitude.

A day passed, and Luo Tian finished crafting the elixirs for Yu Haonan and others. Nightfall arrived.

Luo Tian packed away the Tianji Flame Furnace, stepped into the hut, and found Sun Keinian waiting.

"Come on! Take this!" Sun Keinian laughed, handing Luo Tian a talisman.

Luo Tian puzzledly took the talisman and waited for Sun Keinian’s explanation.

"Stick it on your forehead!" Sun Keinian didn’t hesitate, sticking the talisman to his own head and sitting cross-legged, waiting for ghosts.

"Try it!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, then summoned the Ghost-Subduing Seal and subdued ghosts. He followed Sun Keinian’s example, sticking the talisman to his forehead.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian stuck the talisman on his head, waves of energy radiated from it. His mind stirred.

"Maybe it really works!" Luo Tian felt some anticipation, waiting with Sun Keinian for nightfall.

Yu Changtian, seeing Luo Tian did the same, looked strange and also stuck the talisman to his forehead.

"Buzz..." Ghost energy flowed into the hut from all directions, and the talismans on Luo Tian’s three heads emitted waves of energy, attracting the abundant ghost energy.

Chapter 1823: Success in Receiving Elixirs

"Really works!" Luo Tian was shocked, realizing the strange talisman on his forehead had indeed transformed ghost energy into dense immortal energy, merging it into his dantian.

"I am a genius! Damn, with this place, once I reach Celestial Immortal Mid-stage, I’ll definitely kill that bastard! I, Sun Keinian, have never suffered such a big loss!" Sun Keinian laughed wildly.

"Stop talking nonsense, focus on cultivation and find a way to save you!" Luo Tian scolded him.

Luo Tian’s words ended, and the thatched hut returned to silence, only ghosts howling outside.

One night passed silently. Luo Tian and the others opened their eyes, smiling—overnight cultivation had improved their strength equal to a month of hard work.

Luo Tian retracted the Ghost-Subduing Seal, walked to the market, and saw Yu Haonan and others anxiously waiting.

"Relief..." Seeing Luo Tian had returned, Yu Haonan and others sighed, their worries about Luo Tian fleeing with their herbs eased.

"Master, how is it?" Yu Haonan approached Luo Tian with anticipation.

"It was successful!" Luo Tian smiled, waving his hand and sending several jade bottles to the others. He then sat back at his previous spot, raising the banner again.

Yu Haonan and others carefully took the bottles, surprised Luo Tian had finished their elixirs so quickly. They all opened the bottles.

"Buzz..." As the bottles were opened, a surge of dense herbal energy erupted, forming several long dragons with massive herbal power that soared into the sky.
