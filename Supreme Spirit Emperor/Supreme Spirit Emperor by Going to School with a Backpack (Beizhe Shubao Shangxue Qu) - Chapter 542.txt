“Saw-Tooth Ghost!” Seeing the creature covered in jagged teeth, people gasped in surprise, their eyes filled with astonishment.

“Truly fast!” People marveled, watching the Saw-Tooth Ghost and the young man.

“Roar…” Just as they marveled, a roar echoed through heaven and earth, causing the newly formed Saw-Tooth Ghost to tremble instantly.

“It’s an Earth-Level ghost!” People immediately turned their gazes toward the direction of the terrifying aura, a black dragon coiling in the sky.

Yet this dragon had only one head; its black wings spread wide, roaring before landing beside Luo Long, emitting a series of affectionate sounds.

“It’s a Ghost Dragon! An Earth-Level ghost!” People were stunned, gazing at the black dragon with envy.

“This Ghost Dragon could definitely enter the late-stage True Immortal!” All marveled endlessly.

“Not bad, Luo Long! You’ve managed to cultivate an Earth-Level ghost!” Praise echoed around, and Luo Long’s face bore a triumphant smile.

A tiger’s roar rang out, a wave of authority sweeping over the crowd, causing their faces to shift again, eyes filled with awe.

The black tiger stood atop the arena, its fierce eyes radiating authority, gazing at the ghost dragon with hostility.

“Hellish Ghost Tiger!” People gasped again, their eyes filled with disbelief as they spoke.

“It’s a ghost of equal power to the Ghost Dragon! So this is Luo Hu, no wonder!” When people saw the young man standing beside the Hellish Ghost Tiger, their eyes lit with understanding.

At the same time, thunderous sounds echoed repeatedly; other prodigies of the Luo family on the high platform began to cultivate their ghosts.

Roars filled the air, each cultivation causing a wave of gasps; every ghost was immensely powerful. Each was at least an Earth-Level, meaning it could enter the middle stage of True Immortal.

“Most have finished—only two remain!” People’s gazes turned to Luo Tian and Luo Bai, still in the process of cultivation.

Black ghost energy had already enveloped them, terrifying auras radiating from their bodies, causing people to feel awe.

They were even more eager, for one was blood of the Heavenly Grade and the other bore the blood of a King Beast—what would they cultivate?

Half an hour passed, and finally, roars emerged from the thick black mist: a black ghost pearl appeared in Luo Tian and Luo Bai’s hands, forming almost simultaneously.

“Little Brother, you go first!” Luo Bai smiled all the while, gazing at Luo Tian and spoke, his voice carrying an imperious tone.

If it had been the old Luo Chen, he might have obeyed Luo Bai’s words, for in his eyes, Luo Bai was his good elder brother.

But now the one before them wasn’t Luo Chen but Luo Tian, so he wouldn’t obey Luo Bai. Instead, his eyes smiled: “You are the elder brother; it’s your turn!”

“How have you been these days?”

“Does it feel good to be arrogant? If you wish to continue like this, I can let you!”

“Unfortunately, you always think of useless and unrealistic things! Today, as your elder brother, I’ll show you what despair is!” Luo Bai muttered in his heart, then extended a hand to imprint a mark onto the black ghost pearl before him.

“Crack…” A brittle sound echoed, and the black ghost pearl shattered instantly, its dark energy swirling into a vortex.

Amidst the surging power, a flicker of red light appeared—a colossal creature several zhang tall emerged into view.

Black scales, a robust body, a black ox head with crimson eyes—this was the Ox-Head Ghost.

“An Ox-Head Ghost! A Heavenly Grade ghost!” Gasps erupted, and a wave of authority swept over them. All the previously formed ghosts immediately bowed, emitting an aura of submission.

“It’s your turn, my little brother!” Luo Bai leapt into the air and stood upon the black ox head, looking down at Luo Tian with overwhelming confidence. At this moment, he also realized that his little brother had changed.

“A Heavenly Grade ghost—Ox-Head Ghost! Truly impressive!” Luo Tian still smiled, then extended a hand to imprint the mark as well.

The black ghost pearl cracked open; ghost energy surged, and an overwhelming aura radiated from Luo Tian’s hands.

Heaven and earth changed color; all ghosts roared, and every ghost howled skyward.

The Luo family was a clan of ghost-rearing; they had a special place for ghosts within their estate. At this moment, all the ghosts went wild.

“Rebellion!” In an instant, every ghost of the Luo family rebelled, causing everyone’s faces to show shock.

“Surely a supreme ghost has emerged!” Luoshui, Luochengyang, and the many elders of the Luo family had expressions that changed drastically.

In the Luo family’s underground palace, a black snake coiled there; its body radiated powerful energy.

This was the clan’s treasure, a half-step Immortal King ghost raised by the family’s semi-Immortal King ancestor.

Though this black snake was not a King Beast, its bloodline power was formidable; the three drops of King Beast essence in the Luo family were distilled from this snake’s body.

“Are you interested in this ghost?” A senior appeared beside the black snake, his eyes deep.

“Hiss…” The cold-eyed snake showed fear, shaking its head quickly. Though it was powerful, facing a ghost with higher bloodline power made it tremble slightly.

“Even the black snake shows fear—what kind of ghost is this!” The senior’s eyes also showed eagerness, and he comforted the snake.

Black mist condensed; finally, a dark figure appeared in people’s sight—only half the height of a person, constantly sticking out its tongue. It was none other than a small dog.

“What…?” Luo Tian was stunned, unable to believe such an object would appear.

“Woof…” The black dog barked twice, then approached Luo Tian’s feet, like the three-headed dog before.

“Roar…” All ghosts bowed to the ground, even the ox head ghost that Luo Bai stood upon lay prostrate.

“What is this thing? Shouldn’t it have three heads, but instead it’s a dog…” Luo Tian muttered in his heart, thinking this small dog was weaker than the three-headed dog.

“What is this thing?” Others were equally puzzled, but all felt it was no ordinary creature; if it grew strong, it would become a formidable ghost.

“A King Beast! Naturally a King Beast! But what kind of ghost is it?” Everyone was puzzled.

“This first round, Luo Chen wins!” An old voice echoed; this was none other than the Luo family’s ancestral voice.

“Additionally, since Luo Chen cultivated a King Beast for the Luo family, he is awarded a courtyard and one hundred Earth-Level ghost pearls! If he elevates the King Beast to an Earth-Level, further rewards will be given!” The ancestral voice did not finish, causing a wave of murmurs.

“Indeed, it has awakened the ancestral!”

“But no wonder; it’s a King Beast! Our Luo family only has one with a trace of King Beast blood—the black snake!” People whispered, their eyes envious as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Just by having this King Beast, Luo Chen will never be bullied in the Luo family!”

“This Luo Chen has truly risen!” People were envious beyond measure, never expecting Luo Chen to have actually cultivated a King Beast.

“He must die!” Duan Peizhen stood among the crowd, her eyes filled with ferocity. She knew Luo Chen’s ghost-rearing abilities were terrifying.

“Not enough!” Luoshui’s eyes flashed with light, but he still whispered lowly.

At this moment, Luo Tian was under everyone’s gaze; all knew that Luo Chen had risen by cultivating a King Beast, and the ancestral himself had spoken, granting rewards—this was enough to show everything.

“Luo Chen brother, do you see it? This light was originally yours!” Luo Tian muttered in his heart before gazing at Luo Bai, who approached him.

“Little Brother, I truly am happy for you!” Luo Bai smiled and spoke to Luo Tian, making Luo Tian feel nauseous.

“Thank you, elder brother! I’ve always taken you as my goal!” Luo Tian’s acting was quite convincing, as if he worshipped his elder brother.

“Haha, well done, Little Brother! You must try harder in the next round!” Luo Bai’s eyes showed encouragement and also a sense of satisfaction.

“If nothing goes wrong, the next round will be this kid’s first!” Luo Bai muttered inwardly. For other matters, he dared not say, but for ghost pearl cultivation, he was very certain because his ghost-rearing elixir expertise came from Luo Chen’s methods.

“The next round is cultivating ghost pearls; this contest is very fair—those with better quality ghost pearls win!” Luochengyang spoke again.

“This round should have no suspense; remember, Luo Bai elder brother once cultivated a Yellow-Level ghost elixir. Though it was a Yellow-Level, it was no less than ghost pearls; his talent in this area is truly extraordinary!” People whispered, imagining the previous grand competition.

Even with Luo Bai’s thick skin, his lips twitched slightly; he gazed at Luo Tian and felt better when seeing Luo Tian still looked up to him with reverence.

“Elder Brother, I didn’t expect you to promote the ghost elixir I researched!” Luo Tian spoke as if he were a fool, shouting to Luo Bai.

“…” But before Luo Tian’s words finished, everyone turned their gazes toward him, eyes filled with disbelief.

“Haha, what joke is this? How could a brat like you create such an extraordinary ghost elixir?” A sharp voice echoed, Duan Peizhen’s eyes filled with mockery.

“Indeed, only Luo Bai elder brother, a once-in-a-century genius, could create such a miracle!” Others also loudly agreed, their eyes filled with admiration toward Luo Bai.

“Little Brother, I know you want to show off before father and the clan members, but it’s unnecessary. If you say the ghost elixir was your research, then it is yours!” Luo Bai smiled slightly, looking at Luo Tian with a look of disappointment.

Luo Bai’s words immediately caused the Luo family members to agree, their eyes more disdainful.

“Such a shame that Luo Bai elder brother was so kind to you; he always stood up for you. Now, you want to take credit for his achievements!”

“A thankless traitor!” Among the crowd, someone started a rhythm, beginning to accuse Luo Chen.

“He’s just a bastard son; he thinks because he cultivated a King Beast, he can do whatever he wants. If it weren’t for Luo Bai elder brother, how would he be alive today!” People whispered lowly, all criticizing Luo Tian.

“Who took what from whom, elder brother must know well. After these years, it’s time to return it to me!” Luo Tian smiled lightly; he had come to the Luo family for two reasons: one, to find clues about the mother of the彼岸花 (Biyanghua), and two, to avenge Luo Chen. Luo Chen’s suffering had been too cruel.

“Second round of the grand competition, cultivating ghost pearls—begin!” Before Luo Bai could respond, Luochengyang’s voice echoed again, stopping their quarrel.

“They’ve torn it open; Luo Chen must have found out a lot of things!” Those who understood watched the confrontation between Luo Tian and Luo Bai, their eyes filled with admiration.

“But what is Luo Chen’s confidence?” Soon after, people became puzzled; cultivating a King Beast could ensure Luo Tian’s comfort, but if the family pressed too hard, they could kill Luo Chen and raise this King Beast. Though it would be more troublesome, it was still possible.

“Ghost Pearls!” On the high platform, people began to cultivate ghost energy again; however, most of their attention was on Luo Bai, as they were eager to see what ghost elixir he would cultivate.

“It should be an Earth-Level one, right? Last time it was a Yellow-Level; after so long, Luo Bai must have advanced to an Earth-Level ghost-rearing master!” People gazed at Luo Bai.

“Boom….” A black great cauldron appeared in people’s sight, radiating a cold aura.

“It has arrived—the Black Soul Cauldron, an Upper-Level Ghost Artifact! Luo Bai elder brother indeed intends to refine a ghost elixir!” People immediately became excited, watching the swirling ghost energy enter Luo Bai’s cauldron.

“Little Brother, to beat me, you must show your true strength!” Luo Bai smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Refining elixirs, I’ve never lost to anyone! This ghost elixir is no different!” Luo Tian muttered in his heart; for this contest, he truly had it in the bag.

How many years had Luo Tian refined elixirs? He himself had forgotten. Though this ghost elixir was different from ordinary pills, he had a hundred methods to make Luo Bai lose.

The black cauldron stood before Luo Tian, also drawing people’s attention—though more with disdain.

“Wishing to imitate Luo Bai elder brother? Can he?” Someone spoke, but before they finished, they gasped in surprise because Luo Tian’s ghost energy had become extremely dense, forming a vortex that poured into the black cauldron.

That black vortex gradually expanded, instantly spreading across the entire square; wherever it went, the ghost pearls being cultivated by others exploded, including Luo Bai’s.

“Damn! What happened!” Luo Bai’s face darkened; he felt the ghost elixir in his cauldron beginning to destabilize, as if it could explode at any moment.

“Luo Chen!” Luo Bai immediately saw the black vortex pouring into Luo Tian’s cauldron and understood.

“Boom…” Just as Luo Bai’s face was in despair, a thunderous explosion echoed from beside him.

This explosion had taken everyone by surprise; even Luoshui and others forgot about the high platform, where Luo Bai was still present.

“Damn!” Almost instantly, Luoshui and others realized the truth; ten late-stage True Immortals behind them moved immediately, appearing at ten positions on the high platform. Their hands emitted a series of dark glows.

A black barrier enveloped the entire high platform, stabilizing it while protecting everyone.

Black energy surged; although the ten True Immortals were fast, some were swept up and thrown far away, falling onto the ground.

“What happened!” Almost everyone was stunned, gazing at Luo Bai, who had a cold sweat.

Just now, the cauldron exploded in under a moment; Luo Bai hadn’t reacted in time. In the instant he was thrown, he knew he had lost again.

“Elder Brother Luo Bai, what are you doing!” Everyone’s faces showed anger, gazing at the one standing there—Luo Bai—and thought he was meddling, as they didn’t know about the explosion.

“Elder Brothers, this is a misunderstanding; I will definitely give you an explanation later!” Luo Bai was no ordinary person, and he quickly spoke to regain people’s trust and start discussing compensation.

With Luo Bai’s repeated assurances, people relaxed; after all, Luo Bai’s credibility was still there.

“But how should this be counted? Should we redo it?” People thought of something, as all their ghost pearls had been destroyed. How should this round continue?

“Buzz…” As people lamented, a black magic sun emerged from the cauldron, emitting waves of energy. It radiated a dark sheen, causing people’s faces to slightly change.

“Another one—Luo Chen!” Everyone gazed at the one standing beneath the magic sun, Luo Tian, who looked cold.

At this moment, Luo Tian radiated intense confidence from his bones; this self-confidence came from within himself.

“My good elder brother, now you still say this ghost elixir was your invention?” Luo Tian spoke loudly, his voice carrying a powerful pressure. A strange aura radiated from him, instantly making everyone’s eyes widen.

The magic sun dispersed; Luo Tian extended his hand and a black elixir appeared in people’s sight.

“Indeed, it has the shape of an elixir! Could this ghost elixir truly be from Luo Chen?” Everyone was puzzled, turning their gaze back to Luo Bai.

“This second round, all people’s ghost pearls were destroyed; only Luo Chen succeeded—so Luo Chen is the winner of this round?” Someone spoke in surprise, their voice filled with disbelief.

“He cheated! My cauldron was exploded by him!” Luo Bai’s face finally changed, speaking loudly.

“Indeed, he cheated!” Luo Bai’s words were met with many people agreeing.

“You yourself wanted to refine it, so why blame me…” Luo Tian looked at Luo Bai as if he were a fool, shrugging his shoulders.

“Luo Bai elder brother actually accused Luo Tian of cheating! But we all saw the situation—Luo Bai elder brother’s cauldron exploded on its own…” Someone soon countered.

“This second round, Luo Chen wins!” However, in the midst of people’s discussions, Luoshui, who had remained silent, finally spoke.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian flicked his finger; the black ghost elixir fell into the mouth of the black dog, causing it to bark joyfully. Black energy enveloped its tiny body.

“It’s truly a ghost elixir, even surpassing the one Luo Bai elder brother refined!”

“Earth-Level! This is an Earth-Level ghost pearl’s aura, but it’s several times denser!” People were instantly stunned, watching the black energy solidify around the dog.

“Could everything truly be as Luo Chen said, and this was originally Luo Chen’s?” People turned around, gazing at Luo Bai.

“Truly没想到 it was so simple!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of smile.

“The third round, combat power competition! This battle is crucial! Everyone don’t act rashly!” Luochengyang spoke loudly, glancing at Luo Bai as if giving a warning.

“Indeed, Uncle Cheng is right; if I kill him in the third round, all his glory will be wasted.” Luo Bai’s eyes flashed with murderous intent, gazing at Luo Tian.

“A黑马!” At this moment, almost everyone stared at Luo Tian, never expecting such a黑马 to appear in this grand competition—two firsts had already been secured, which was certain!

“Has he decided to kill him?” Luo Tian saw the murderous intent in Luo Bai’s eyes and muttered inwardly.

“Kill him, Bái’er, you must kill him!” Duan Peizhen stood there, praying constantly.

“The third round is the combat power competition! It’s the final round; please don’t harm your clanmates, try not to kill or maim each other!” Luochengyang spoke again, explaining the rules for this round.

A group of prodigies began drawing lots, pairing up into opponents; Luo Tian was number thirty-six, and his opponent was also a half-step True Immortal prodigy.

“Haha, Luo Chen, I didn’t expect to meet you!” The young man saw the opponent was Luo Tian and showed strong joy.

Luo Chen had proven himself with his strength in this grand competition, surely the first place; after all, he had already won the first two rounds. His attention was definitely high now; if he could defeat Luo Tian at this moment, it would also draw a lot of attention.

“Boom…” However, before the young man could finish speaking, his mind was still daydreaming, a pressure that couldn’t be resisted swept over him. A black hand suddenly descended and smashed down on him.

Chapter 2076: The First Signs of Power ()

The Luo family’s grand competition was in full swing for the final round, and this last round was especially valued by the Luo family members. After all, whether it was a ghost-rearing master or others, real strength was the most important; strength was the foundation.

Thunderous sounds rose from each platform, everyone giving their all to defeat their opponents.

A black hand descended from the sky and instantly pressed down on the young man opposing Luo Tian, who was still thinking about his glory. He was smashed by the black hand and flew backward, falling onto the ground with a thud.

“Boom…” The young man stared around in confusion, not understanding why he was here. After realizing it, his face turned grim.

“I was defeated by that waste Luo Chen!” The young man’s face turned grim, seeing the mocking glances of those around him. His heart was unbearable, but it was too late to say anything.

“Although it was a bit underhanded with an element of ambush, defeating Luo Zhen is still quite good!” People were also surprised, gazing at Luo Tian standing on the platform with a calm face.

“Little bastard, as long as you touch Bái’er, you will definitely die; if you don’t touch him, I’ll still kill you!” Duan Peizhen’s eyes showed ruthless intent, gazing at Luo Tian.

Seeming to sense Duan Peizhen’s gaze, Luo Tian also looked at her, his eyes flashing with waves of killing intent.

This glance made Duan Peizhen feel as if she had fallen into an icy pit, sensing a strange chill. She instinctively shivered.

After that, Luo Tian faced his second opponent—a burly man with a rugged face who stepped onto Luo Tian’s platform.

“Haha, Luo Chen, I’m not like Luo Zhen the fool….” The man laughed and spoke, but before he finished, a black hand appeared again, striking the man and sending him off the platform.

“Haha…” Observers of Luo Tian immediately erupted in laughter, their eyes filled with amusement as the man stood up, his face red. He hadn’t realized he had made the same mistake as the previous person.

“Thank you, Elder Brother Luo Bai, for your mercy!” However, after the laughter died down, people turned their attention to Luo Bai’s platform.

Compared to Luo Tian’s platform, Luo Bai’s was the center of attention. Luo Bai was very hypocritical, appearing as a good elder brother to each opponent and giving them face; no one was injured.

“Indeed, Elder Brother Luo Bai is the top choice in both character and strength!” The speaker was Luoping, the first person Luo Tian met upon returning to the Luo family.

“Indeed, this time was meant to let Elder Brother Luo Bai win three firsts and then announce him as the next clan leader. Unexpectedly, things turned out this way! Unexpectedly, that waste Luo Chen slipped through!” Another person spoke, their voice filled with anger.

“Still, to say it, that Luo Chen was out of our expectations; if not for that incident, who would be the top prodigy in the Luo family?” A senior spoke, their voice filled with admiration.

However, as soon as the senior’s words finished, these people fell silent, and the atmosphere became awkward.

“Why bring up past matters!” At this moment of silence, Luoshui coldly spoke, their voice filled with ice.

“Master said it!” One of the people gave them a way out, and they all sighed in relief. Especially the senior who had brought up the topic secretly exhaled a breath of relief.

The competition continued, and the number of people on the platforms decreased. Luo Bai’s platform was always the focus of attention, and he never disappointed people; no matter who his opponent was, he never exceeded three moves, leaving everyone in awe.

Luo Long and Luo Hu’s performances were also very eye-catching. By the later stages of the competition, only eight people remained on the platform.

These eight young men were the strongest among the Luo family’s younger generation, and one figure was unexpectedly eye-catching—Luo Chen.

At first, people hadn’t noticed Luo Tian, but as time passed and the number of people decreased, they observed Luo Tian.

“Luo Chen’s luck is too good! Is there some secret behind it?” People immediately gasped, gazing at Luo Tian. It was truly that Luo Tian’s opponents were either too weak or careless, or had some physical issues.

From the beginning, Luoshui was watching Luo Tian closely; he was the only one in the entire Luo family who had observed Luo Tian from the start.

Luo Tian’s every opponent seemed to have some unexpected incidents, but Luoshui saw it clearly—each time, Luo Tian had only one move.

“No strength, no luck!” Luoshui whispered lowly, gazing at the one standing there.

No one had expected Luo Chen to appear in the top eight, as his image in people’s minds was deeply rooted as weak.

“Actually, even if Luo Chen himself participated in this grand competition, reaching this point would be no difficulty!” Luo Tian sighed longingly, still feeling sorry for Luo Chen.

“You eight will all receive rewards from the family!” Luochengyang smiled and spoke to Luo Tian and others. Reaching the top eight was enough to show their strength.

“Now, there is only one first!” Luochengyang spoke, and the eight people re-drew lots to find their opponents. Luo Tian saw a young man approaching him.

“Luo Hu!” One of the three prodigies of the Luo family, his cultivation was on par with Luo Long, but both were suppressed by Luo Bai.

“Little Brother, be careful; this is a tiger—perhaps it will eat you down to the last crumb!” Luo Bai spoke to Luo Tian, then walked toward his opponent.

“Thank you, Elder Brother! I’ve always taken you as my goal; naturally, I won’t let this little cat bite me!” Luo Tian responded.

“Luo Chen, your good luck has ended!” Luo Hu heard Luo Tian’s words and showed anger in his voice, a hint of disdain. In the past, Luo Chen wasn’t even worthy to tie his shoes; thus, Luo Hu didn’t regard Luo Tian seriously.

“Unexpectedly, I met Tiger Brother so quickly!” On the stands, Luohong showed madness; he had been eliminated earlier.

But Luohong hadn’t expected much, just holding a grudge against Luo Tian for the past hatred. This grand competition, Luohong had asked Luo Hu and Luo Long, along with others, to break Luo Tian’s legs if they met him.

Originally, Luohong thought Luo Hu and Luo Long would never meet Luo Tian, as their strength was clear. But who could have expected that Luo Tian had unexpectedly surged into the top eight?

“Kid, I was asked to use your legs!” Luo Hu smiled slightly and leapt into the air. His True Immortal Initial stage power surged, transforming him into a black giant tiger and rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Tianlong Wuxiang!” Facing the black tiger, Luo Tian’s eyes flickered slightly. He knew that he couldn’t just use one move now.

Two black fists collided, and Luo Tian took a step back; however, Luo Hu’s body suddenly turned around and flew backward.

“How is this possible!” Luohong widened his eyes, stood up immediately, and gazed at Luo Tian standing there.

Not only Luohong, but everyone observing the battle between Luo Tian and Luo Hu showed strong shock, gazing at Luo Tian standing proudly.

“Chen’er, what opportunity did you obtain? Has the ghost blood issue been resolved?” Luoshui’s eyes showed excitement, his eyelids slightly moist.

“Kill!” Luo Tian moved swiftly like a dragon, soaring upward and instantly appearing beside Luo Hu. He still delivered one punch.

A half-step True Immortal, Luo Tian’s cultivation was still a half-step True Immortal, but his strength surpassed the initial stage of True Immortal. Even people like Chen Tiansheng couldn’t match Luo Tian when he was a half-step True Immortal. How much more so for Luo Hu?

“Black Tiger Heart Attack!” Luo Hu’s face changed, and he extended a hand. He didn’t care about Luo Tian’s punch but instead struck toward Luo Tian’s chest.

“Trading injury for injury, you don’t have that qualification!” Luo Tian showed disdain on his face and delivered a punch with double the physical strength, striking Luo Hu’s chest.

Two heavy sounds rose from both of their chests; the black tiger spat blood, and his chest caved in. His eyes also showed intense shock.

Luo Tian stood there, and Luo Hu’s attack had no effect on him at all.

“You want to cripple my legs? I’ll grant you that!” Luo Tian smiled slightly and delivered a palm strike, transforming it into a blade to cut at Luo Hu’s legs.

At the same time, a gray soul sword flew out from Luo Tian’s mind and joined his palm blade to strike at Luo Hu’s legs.

A scream of agony accompanied the blood, causing people around to fall silent and gaze at Luo Tian standing proudly.

“My legs!” Luo Hu’s eyes showed fear, gazing at his severed legs. If it were a regular severing, he might be able to reattach them in a short time. However, Luo Hu could feel his legs were completely ruined; to reattach them would definitely require a massive cost.

From Luo Tian’s attack to cutting off Luo Hu’s legs, the speed was极致, leaving no one expecting Luo Hu would lose so quickly.

“My god! Luo Chen has defeated Luo Hu and done it cleanly, even cutting off his opponent’s legs!” Exclamations echoed immediately, as if igniting people and drawing everyone's attention to Luo Tian.

Chapter 2077: The First Signs of Power ()

“If it was luck before, how do you explain this now!”

“He had been concealing himself all along; after so many years, he was waiting for this chance to soar! If that’s the case, Luo Chen’s mind is truly terrifying!” Several True Immortal Late-stage elders showed shock.

Luo Chen defeated Luo Hu and advanced to the semifinals; this would have been unthinkable for the Luo family before. But now it was a fact—no one could believe that a waste had turned around and appeared in people’s sight with such status.

First, he revealed the King Beast blood, cultivating a King Beast; then he defeated Luo Bai with his ghost elixir in two rounds.

After that, people had thought Luo Chen was just average, but he had advanced to the semifinals.

After the semifinals, two moves were enough to defeat one of the Luo family’s three prodigies—Luo Hu.

At this point, no one dared to doubt the strength of this former waste. Moreover, he had defeated a True Immortal Luo Hu with only a half-step True Immortal strength. This achievement was only previously achieved by Luo Bai.

Luo Tian stood with his hands folded, showing no expression; he gazed toward Luo Bai’s direction with eyes full of provocation.

“Is this waiting for Elder Brother Luo Bai to finish his battle?” People showed shock, seeing Luo Tian’s provocation.

Luo Bai seemed to sense Luo Tian’s provocation and flashed a glint of coldness in his eyes. He formed an incantation with his hands, and a black sword cut into the young man opposing him.

The black blade energy exploded on the young man’s body, causing him to spit blood and fall onto the platform. He never woke up again; his chest had a bone-exposing wound.

“Elder Brother Luo Bai is angry! No one before him has ever been injured so severely!” People felt Luo Bai’s anger.

“This brother and brother have completely torn open their faces!” Those who understood the relationship between them sighed deeply.

“But how did Luo Chen know? Although many people knew that Luo Chen’s success was thanks to Luo Bai, it had always been hidden well; no one dared to tell Luo Chen the truth!” People immediately became puzzled.

“I see, it’s because of Luo Chen’s two attendants; they’ve been investigating information these days and must have heard many rumors!” People saw Zhang Menlie and Liu Cheng, who were unobtrusive in the crowd.

“Little Brother, I didn’t expect you to have advanced so far!” Luo Bai smiled slightly and still wore the appearance of a good elder brother.

“Thank you, Elder Brother! If it weren’t for your teachings, I wouldn’t have this today!” Luo Tian smiled with a smile, but this smile made people feel like a gust of cold wind and raised a chill in their hearts.

“Did you know?” Luo Bai’s eyes flashed with a glint of killing intent, and he spoke softly.

“If you don’t want others to know, then you must not do it! You yourself should be clear about what you’ve done!” Luo Tian clenched his fists slightly and gazed not at Luo Bai but toward the people sitting above.

Luo Tian was observing their attitudes and also considering whether to kill Luo Bai.

However, he immediately saw Luoshui’s encouraging gaze, which made him feel slightly reassured and knew what to do next.

“Knowing doesn’t change anything, does it? Everything you have should be mine; your survival until now is only because I still value some blood ties!”
