Luo Tian did not rush; he moved toward the entrance at a steady pace. Lu Shao, the elder with the surname Lu, spoke softly after Luo Tian and the seven others disappeared into the hall.
"Are we not discussing the rules?"

"Rules would make it uninteresting. I had to accept my sister's request; otherwise, she'd have come to bother me in the inner sect!" Shen Elder spoke softly, his gaze fixed on the Eternal Life Tower.

The transmission's fluctuation rippled through space, and Luo Tian appeared in an empty chamber instantly. The grand hall was filled with figures—those who had participated in the trial.

Staircases materialized before their eyes, causing a brief moment of surprise.
"The Eternal Life Tower has seven levels. In three days, the one holding the Break Heaven Seal shall become an inner sect elder!" A group of figures rushed toward the second level.

"Is it really that simple?" Luo Tian overheard murmurs from the crowd as they surged toward the second level.

"Speed contests? That suits me perfectly—I'm too lazy to waste time!" Luo Tian mused internally, leaping into the air with a sudden burst of speed. His form became a blur, surpassing everyone instantly and rushing toward the second level.

"Amazingly fast! How could Zhou Xiong be so quick?" The crowd felt a rush of wind past their ears, and Luo Tian's figure was already at the second level. Even Lu Xiu and the others were taken aback.

"Chase him!" Lu Xiu's group looked grim; they had come to prevent Zhou Xiong from entering the inner sect.

"Boom...!" Upon reaching the second level, a thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

A group of green-armored puppets appeared before him, exuding the aura of a late-stage True Immortal. They charged toward Luo Tian.

Seeing these late-stage True Immortals, Luo Tian let out a light laugh without hesitation. He didn't even draw his weapon, allowing the puppets to strike him directly as he pushed forward recklessly.

"Crash..." Each puppet was shattered by Luo Tian's collision, and he carved a path through them with brute force, swiftly reaching the third level.

"No challenge at all!" Luo Tian shook his head as he faced a hundred puppets at the peak of True Immortality. He rushed forward again.

To others, these might have been difficult, but to Luo Tian, they were trivial. His unparalleled physical body could easily shatter these puppets.

Fourth level... fifth level...

Luo Tian advanced like a storm, and the strongest in the tower was merely a step beyond Immortal King. To Luo Tian, it was just one strike. Meanwhile, those behind him benefited from Luo Tian's reckless approach, reducing the difficulty significantly. Though their speed lagged behind Luo Tian's, they were numerous and only slightly slower.

"Seventh level!" After a day of fighting, Luo Tian finally reached the seventh level. He had deliberately slowed down for the last two levels—after all, to ensure safety, some techniques couldn't be used yet. Also, he wanted to maintain his step-beyond-Immortal King strength and avoid drawing too much attention.

Chapter 2470: Qiongqi (The Monster)

A green light screen appeared before Luo Tian's eyes. Two seals floated within it, radiating radiant divine light.

"Too simple!" Luo Tian mused internally as he stepped toward the screen. But just as he took a step, a series of humming sounds echoed from the screen.

"Roar..." A roar erupted, and a monstrous figure materialized before Luo Tian. Its thick palm slammed down toward him fiercely.

"Early-stage Immortal King!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. Crimson scales covered its back, and sharp spines glimmering with cold light adorned its limbs. Its entire body exuded an evil aura.

"Qiongqi!" Luo Tian instantly recognized the beast's identity and took a step back with the Yellow Spring Steps.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed as the beast's thick claws struck the ground, shaking the entire seventh level.

"Malevolent by nature, feeding on human brains!" Luo Tian recalled the description of Qiongqi from the Classic of Mountains and Seas. Then, his Split Heaven Spear materialized in his hand.

"Unknown if anyone is watching outside!" Luo Tian mused internally. If he relied solely on his step-beyond-Immortal King strength, defeating this beast would still be challenging.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian pondered, Qiongqi lunged forward with four limbs.

Its claws descended again, faster than before. Luo Tian raised his spear and restrained his cultivation level, meeting the crimson claws head-on.

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed as the Split Heaven Spear emitted a series of humming vibrations. Luo Tian bent his legs slightly, shouted loudly, and charged forward.

Step by step... Luo Tian and Qiongqi both retreated. Qiongqi's crimson eyes showed surprise; it was a beast bred by the Eternal Life Mountain, possessing Immortal King-level strength. Its intelligence had been awakened, and it was sent by Shen Tianchang to deal with Luo Tian. The previous strike alone could not have been countered even by an early-stage Immortal King, yet Luo Tian had only been pushed back.

"Such immense strength!" Luo Tian mused internally, gazing at Qiongqi and recalling its description—unparalleled strength and an invincible body.

"Roar..." Qiongqi roared again, charging toward Luo Tian once more.

...
While Luo Tian fought Qiongqi, Lu Xiu's group reached the sixth level. Originally eight half-Immortal Kings' puppets had been there, but Luo Tian had shattered three of them. Now only five remained.

"Still haven't caught up with Zhou Xiong!" The crowd's faces showed disbelief; they hadn't expected Zhou Xiong to be so formidable, capable of defeating even half-Immortal Kings.

"Kill him! Even if he obtained the seal, there are still two days left. We can definitely eliminate him together!" Su Tianyang spoke, his voice laced with killing intent, causing Lu Xiu's group to ignite their murderous intent.

A person who had once been trampled and manipulated by them now stood above them—how could they accept it?

"Master Shen Tianchang didn't mention any rules, meaning there are no rules. We can kill!"

"Exactly! Zhou Xiong was once Shen Lingyuan's lover. Now that he has become strong, he definitely won't be her lover anymore. Thus, he offended Master Shen Tianchang!" The crowd instantly understood.

"You all don't compete for the inner sect elder's qualification, but you must join us!" Lu Xiu addressed the elders at the peak of True Immortality.

"Good!" The elders at the peak of True Immortality naturally wouldn't miss this opportunity and nodded in agreement.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian clashed fiercely with Qiongqi. Both possessed invincible bodies; Luo Tian wielded the Split Heaven Spear with fierce momentum, repeatedly striking Qiongqi's body and causing it to roar in anger. Luo Tian also feigned vomiting blood, appearing injured but his attacks had indeed inflicted significant damage on Qiongqi.

"Are you honest?" Luo Tian panted, his body moving swiftly and ignoring Qiongqi's domain as he rushed toward it again.

"Roar..." Qiongqi roared, unwilling to be defeated by a mere half-Immortal King. Another battle commenced.

After half an hour...

"Groan..." Qiongqi emitted a groaning sound, its tail curled as it trembled in the corner. Its red eyes gazed at Luo Tian with fear.

At this moment, Qiongqi was extremely disheveled; its back spines were broken in large numbers, blood splattered everywhere. Its fierce tiger-like head had swollen significantly, and it bore numerous injuries from the Clearing Wind technique.

"Yield?" Luo Tian gazed at Qiongqi, holding the Split Heaven Spear as he addressed it.

The swollen tiger head nodded repeatedly, its eyes filled with fear toward Luo Tian.

"Go away!" Luo Tian addressed Qiongqi and strode toward the green light screen, extending his hand to grasp the two Break Heaven Seals.

"Groan..." Qiongqi groaned, fleeing as if granted a pardon, its massive body rushing toward the sixth level.

At the same time, Lu Xiu and Su Tianyang arrived at the stairs leading to the seventh level. Just as they were about to ascend, they saw Qiongqi rushing downward.

"What is this thing?" Lu Xiu's group exclaimed in surprise, instantly sensing Qiongqi's terrifying presence and hastily clearing the path.

"Roar..." Qiongqi let out a roar, determined to maintain its dignity. It expanded its domain and rushed down the stairs.

"Immortal King!" Upon sensing the domain, Lu Xiu's group trembled instantly, too afraid to even breathe. Qiongqi ignored them and continued rushing downward, reaching the first level in a moment. Its body radiated fluctuations and burst through the closed door.

"Too terrifying! What was that beast? It felt like Master Chen's mount Qiongqi!" Even after Qiongqi disappeared, Lu Xiu's group took a full minute to recover from their trembling.

"But why is there blood on it? I've seen Master Chen's mount before; it was very majestic. But why does its face seem distorted?" Su Tianyang furrowed his brows.

"Zhou Xiong!" The crowd's eyes brightened instantly, realizing Luo Tian had reached the seventh level.

"It must be Zhou Xiong fighting Qiongqi, and in the end, he unleashed all his secrets, injuring Qiongqi, who then ate him!" Lu Xiu spoke loudly and confidently. After all, in their view, a half-Immortal King facing an Immortal King beast could not possibly resist. Even if Luo Tian had obtained a remarkable inheritance and his strength had improved, with secrets he would inevitably lose.

"Let's go see; maybe we can find two bones!" Su Tianyang's eyes gleamed, stepping toward the stairs.

"Boom..." A massive body appeared in the hall, causing Shen Tianchang and Lu Shao to startle slightly.

"Roar..." Qiongqi roared at Shen Tianchang, expressing its dissatisfaction. It ignored the two astonished individuals and rushed out of the hall.

"What happened inside? Qiongqi left early? And why is it so angry?" Shen Tianchang felt a bad premonition.

As Shen Tianchang pondered, Lu Xiu's group ascended the seventh level. Upon entering, they smelled a fragrant aroma.

"Here you are!" A soft laugh echoed in their ears as Luo Tian sat there, a iron plate hovering above him. Below the plate, flames roared, and a large piece of meat sizzled on it, emitting a crackling sound. The fragrance came from here.

"Zhou Xiong..." Lu Xiu's group widened their eyes, unable to believe what they saw.

"The plate has writing; it's the Break Heaven Seal..." A peak True Immortal strength individual exclaimed, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were a deity.

"Using the Break Heaven Seal to roast meat... Wait, where did this meat come from?" The crowd was stunned, recalling Qiongqi's appearance and forming a bad feeling.

"Did Zhou Xiong drive away Qiongqi? Impossible!" Their eyes showed disbelief; they couldn't fathom how Luo Tian had achieved this. Even Lu Xiu's group of half-Immortal Kings were confused, wondering why the mighty Qiongqi, an Immortal King beast with Immortal King-level strength, had left.

"Even if he drove away Qiongqi, he must have paid a heavy price. His current ease is just an act!" Lu Xiu transmitted mentally to Su Tianyang's group.

"Same thought! I think now is the best opportunity to kill him!" Su Tianyang's group responded, their eyes flashing with murderous intent as they watched Luo Tian devouring meat.

"Strange, this meat is really fragrant!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration as he mused internally and turned to look at Lu Xiu's group.

"The Break Heaven Seal is right here, everyone. I can let go of one, but I have to keep this one!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and the oil-stained Break Heaven Seal flew toward their feet, gradually shrinking.

"Zhou Xiong! We also want the other one!" Su Tianyang roared, drawing his long sword and slashing toward Luo Tian.

At the same moment, others also launched their attacks, aiming to kill Luo Tian with a single strike.

A series of martial techniques descended upon Luo Tian's head, but he remained motionless.

Boom... Boom... The thunderous sound echoed as the martial techniques engulfed Luo Tian, shaking the entire hall and making his figure vanish from sight.

"Indeed, he's exhausted and can't even fight back!" Seeing Luo Tian engulfed by the martial techniques, Lu Xiu's group showed strong joy.

"Snap..." Just as they were delighted, a streak of light suddenly appeared before Lu Xiu's face and slapped directly onto it. Lu Xiu's body took two steps back.

A piece of cooked meat fell from Lu Xiu's face, revealing his twisted old face.

"Let you be a corpse! Since you wanted to kill me so much, I'll grant your wish!" A cold voice echoed through the hall.

"Zhou Xiong!" The crowd heard the sound and shivered, seeing Luo Tian standing in the hall's corner.

Chapter 2471: Calculations

Shadows flickered as Luo Tian's eyes burned with killing intent, vanishing from the spot. A black spear pierced through space and appeared before Lu Xiu instantly, leaving him no time to react.

"Pop..." The black spear pierced Lu Xiu's throat, his eyes still filled with shock as he emitted a clicking sound. Luo Tian kicked out, sending Lu Xiu's corpse flying with a smile on his face as he gazed at the others.

"Lu Xiu is dead, one strike—no chance to react!" Su Tianyang's group showed fear, completely terrified by Luo Tian.

"Zhou Xiong..."

"It was our mistake; we are willing to compensate!" A half-Immortal King elder spoke, Lu Xiu being their strongest among the elders. Yet he was eliminated by Luo Tian without a chance to fight back, leaving them no match for Luo Tian.

"It's too late!" Luo Tian smiled, becoming a god of death and rushing toward the crowd with his spear.

"Die! We'll fight you!" Seeing Luo Tian's killing intent, the crowd realized he wouldn't let them live and attacked him.

"Pop..." However, Luo Tian ignored them entirely, using his speed beyond a half-Immortal King to leave countless afterimages. The black spear struck the throats of these elders like a venomous snake with precision.

One kill per ten steps, Luo Tian's movements were incomprehensible to these elders, and one by one they fell in the hall. Regret filled their hearts; they finally believed that Qiongqi was defeated by Luo Tian, but it was too late.

"Master Zhou, I will forever follow you! Please spare me!" Each True Immortal was pierced through the throat and begged for mercy before dying.

An hour passed, and no True Immortal peak survivors remained; only six half-Immortal Kings stood trembling.

Too terrifying! These six half-Immortal Kings, including Su Tianyang, showed fear; Luo Tian killed them faster than slaughtering chickens. How could they not be terrified?

"Kneel..." Su Tianyang fell to his knees on the ground, knowing they couldn't resist.

"Zhou Xiong, it was all my fault; I beg you for a chance to be your dog!" Su Tianyang spoke loudly, his voice trembling.

"Pop..." The cold spear pierced Su Tianyang's throat, and Luo Tian finally appeared in their sight.

"It's too late!" Luo Tian sneered, these half-Immortal Kings had repeatedly provoked him. They were also from the Eternal Life Mountain; Luo Tian would never let them live. If he spared them, it would bring trouble in the future. Enemies were not meant to be left alive.

"Out!" The others shouted, quickly wielding their martial techniques. They realized they couldn't beg anymore; Luo Tian would never let them live.

Several martial techniques erupted, and Luo Tian suddenly turned around, almost causing their techniques to miss.

"Enough of this!" Luo Tian smiled lightly and punched out, instantly shattering the six's martial techniques. One spear strike took each of their lives.

The hall turned blood-red, with corpses lying everywhere. Luo Tian furrowed his brows and walked downstairs.

Returning to the first level, Luo Tian pushed against the hall's door but found it sealed by a barrier.

"Won't let us out? Must wait three days?" Luo Tian mused internally, feeling anxious.

At this moment, Zhang Daotian's soul was at its weakest; only eight days remained. Luo Tian didn't want to waste time waiting here idly.

"This barrier isn't strong! An early-stage Immortal King can break it!"

"It must be Shen Tianchang's doing. He probably won't lift the barrier until the third day!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

"Never mind, I'll open it myself!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and the Split Heaven Spear reappeared in his grasp.

"It's time for you to shine!" Luo Tian smiled, and a streak of black energy flashed across his hand, brushing over the spear's surface.

Where Luo Tian's palm touched, a series of runes appeared, and as the runes manifested, the Split Heaven Spear's aura surged. The spear emitted a series of humming vibrations. As the spear's aura rose, the Eternal Life Tower also hummed, as if sensing danger.

"What's wrong with the Eternal Life Tower?" Shen Tianchang and Lu Shao noticed the tower's tremors, their eyes filled with confusion. They were only responsible for guarding the Eternal Life Tower; such an elite artifact was beyond their control.

The black spear radiated overwhelming energy, its divine laws flowing through it. This was the enhanced Split Heaven Spear, an elite artifact that had been sealed by Luo Tian with special techniques to avoid drawing attention.

The sound of explosion rose, and in the next moment, a dark spear beam flashed, striking directly at Shen Tianchang's barrier.

"Crash..." The green barrier was pierced by Luo Tian's spear, disintegrating into divine laws that swept around.

"I've broken my barrier!" Shen Tianchang felt it instantly, his face slightly changing.

"Boom..." As Shen Tianchang was about to check the situation inside the tower, a thunderous sound echoed through the hall. The Eternal Life Tower's door shattered violently, and a figure rushed out of it.

At the same time, a blood-scented aura swept through the hall, making Shen Tianchang and Lu Shao's faces turn serious.

"Who!" Both of them expanded their domains, merging instantly to enclose the entire hall.

"Greetings, Elder Shen, Elder Lu!" Luo Tian stepped out, his face showing respect as he bowed slightly to them.

"Zhou Xiong!" Their brows furrowed, surprised that Luo Tian had emerged from the Eternal Life Tower.

"Two elders, this is the Break Heaven Seal; I can't enter the inner sect?" Luo Tian waved his hand, addressing the two elders who were momentarily stunned.

"Where are they?" Shen Tianchang's face darkened, sensing the strong blood scent and feeling a bad premonition.

"They competed for the Break Heaven Seal, fought among themselves; I took advantage of their chaos and they seem to have died!" Luo Tian spoke.

"Damn it!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Shen Tianchang and Lu Shao's faces darkened. They immediately sent their spiritual awareness into the Eternal Life Tower.

"Everyone... everyone is dead..." Their eyes widened instantly as they saw the seventh level's scene, recalling Qiongqi's earlier escape.

"It's a disaster!" They felt their hair stand on end; seven half-Immortal Kings from the outer sect had died. This matter could be either big or small, but with their positions, they wouldn't face punishment, yet they would still be held accountable.

"Zhou Xiong! You've killed the outer sect elders of Eternal Life Mountain!" Shen Tianchang's face turned dark, his eyes filled with anger as he raised a hand and slammed it toward Luo Tian.

"Quick to change faces!" Luo Tian felt immediate tension, simultaneously raising his hands to meet Shen Tianchang's crushing palm.

"Boom..." In an instant, the thunderous sound echoed as Luo Tian's feet sank into the ground, his mouth spewing blood.

"Damn it! How much blood did I fake!" Luo Tian cursed internally, pretending to be in pain. His body staggered back, gazing at Shen Tianchang.

"Indeed strong, but still won't escape death!" Shen Tianchang's face showed surprise; he hadn't expected a mere half-Immortal King to block his furious strike.

"How many times can you withstand it?" Shen Tianchang's face showed a cold smile, raising his hand again to crush Luo Tian.

But just as Shen Tianchang launched another attack, a massive hand appeared in the air and collided with him, causing the hall to tremble.

"Master Lu, what's your intention?" Shen Tianchang's face showed disbelief as he gazed at the old man beside him.

"Master Shen Tianchang, do you know your crime? As an examiner, you didn't inform the elders participating in the trial of the rules, leading to the outer sect elders' deaths!"

"You also used your power to let Qiongqi enter the Eternal Life Tower, conspiring to kill our sect elders!"

"I've reported this to the head of the Enforcement Hall. You'll be arrested!" Elder Lu spoke coldly, his voice causing Shen Tianchang's face to darken.

"Lu Tianjiu...!" Shen Tianchang's face turned red, staring at the old man with a smile. His chest heaved violently, and after a long silence, he couldn't speak.

"Betrayed!" Shen Tianchang instantly realized he had been outwitted by Lu Tianjiu. He never expected to be betrayed by Lu Tianjiu himself.

"Why!" Shen Tianchang could only submit, gazing fiercely at Lu Tianjiu; although their relationship wasn't deep, they had cooperated for years. He was the head of this hall, while Lu Tianjiu was the vice-head.

"Three of you, come with us!" Just as Shen Tianchang questioned Lu Tianjiu, several figures appeared at the hall's entrance. Three True Immortals peak-level individuals with powerful auras, but their robes were different from ordinary Eternal Life Mountain disciples.

"This is the head's decree; please don't make us trouble!" One disciple spoke, holding out a jade slip.

"I submit; but Lu Tianjiu, this isn't over!" Shen Tianchang glared at Lu Tianjiu with hatred, his teeth clenched. He knew he would be punished severely this time, though it wouldn't cost him his life. He'd definitely suffer a loss and pay heavily.

The three followed the three Enforcement Hall disciples out of the hall, passing through the crowd in the outer hall. This immediately drew people's attention.

"What's going on? Why are Master Shen and Vice-Master Lu being taken by the Enforcement Hall? And why is Elder Zhou also taken? He was participating in the inner sect trial, right?" People's eyes showed confusion as they watched the three leave the hall.

After an hour of walking, the three were taken to the Enforcement Hall. A senior elder with a cold face sat in a main hall, his eyes filled with icy hostility—this was the head of the Enforcement Hall of Eternal Life Mountain.

Chapter 2472: Entering the Inner Sect

Zhang Yuting, head of the Enforcement Hall, had an early-stage Immortal King cultivation but held a much higher status than Shen Tianchang and Lu Shao. Zhang Yuting's position was superior to the two elders, as the Eternal Life Hall and the Supplemental Heaven Mountain's Supplemental Heavens Pavilion were above any other hall in Eternal Life Mountain.

Zhang Yuting's appointment as Enforcement Hall head demonstrated his high status within Eternal Life Mountain.

"Trouble at this time!" Zhang Yuting's face darkened; the entire Eternal Life Mountain's elders were busy with Luo Tian's matter, even the Immortal King himself had pressured. Zhang Yuting hadn't expected this to happen at such a time, with eight half-Immortal Kings from the outer sect reduced to one.

"Severely punish them! They must be severely punished!" Zhang Yuting cursed internally, shouting at the disciples: "Where are they? Haven't they arrived yet?"

"Master, they've already come. I believe they won't dare to refuse!" A half-Immortal King Enforcement Hall elder spoke respectfully.

As the elder's words ended, three Enforcement Hall disciples led Luo Tian and the two elders into the main hall.

"Shen Tianchang, Lu Shao! You've truly dared to do this!" Upon seeing the three enter, Zhang Yuting shouted loudly, his eyes cold as he stared at them.

"Master Zhang Yuting, I accept my guilt; it was a personal grudge with this boy. Whatever punishment you decide, I won't refuse!" Shen Tianchang's face was dark; he didn't argue. After all, the scene in the Eternal Life Tower could be verified, and Luo Tian and Lu Shao clearly intended to accuse him.

However, Shen Tianchang had no fear of death; after all, he was an Immortal King. Immortal Kings were always treated as treasures everywhere.

"Quick to admit guilt! Remove your position as head, let Lu Shao take over. You'll face three years of isolation in the Face-Beating Cliff, but we can delay it since this is a special period. Do you accept?" Zhang Yuting spoke, causing Shen Tianchang's face to darken.

Accepting the three years of isolation was acceptable, but having his head position removed was something he couldn't accept. Although the vice-head and head positions had similar power, their benefits differed significantly. This was why Lu Shao wanted to betray him. As for the three years of isolation, Shen Tianchang knew it was a way to let Zhang Yuting profit.

"Accept!" Shen Tianchang swallowed his anger, never expecting to be defeated by a mere Zhou Xiong.

"For the sake of self-preservation, face one year of isolation!"

"Lu Shao protected witnesses and deserves credit; he will replace Shen Tianchang as the head of the Promotion Hall!" Zhang Yuting spoke, addressing Luo Tian and Lu Shao.

"Damn it! Lu Shao must have already made a deal with Zhang Yuting!" Shen Tianchang's face darkened completely, never expecting Lu Shao to plan so meticulously and miss no details.

"Did I waste my time in the inner sect? How many things did I give away?" Luo Tian mused internally, gazing at Shen Tianchang.

"Nothing more to question; go down!" Zhang Yuting showed satisfaction, addressing Luo Tian and the two elders.

"Yes..." Luo Tian and the others bowed to Zhang Yuting before leaving the Enforcement Hall. Shen Tianchang's face was dark; he wanted to kill Luo Tian but knew he couldn't, so he swallowed his anger.

"Master Lu, it should be Master Lu Head now! Thank you for your help this time. Once I officially enter the inner sect, I'll definitely reward you!" Luo Tian bowed to Lu Shao.

"No problem; this also benefits me. Go ahead!" Lu Shao's face showed satisfaction. Luo Tian had given him many treasures before, and they had discussed for a long time. Lu Shao knew some details about Shen Tianchang's matter, so they had planned together to remove Shen Tianchang.

"Master Shen Tianchang's dereliction of duty has been confirmed; he is demoted to vice-head, and the Promotion Hall head position will be taken by Lu Shao!" As soon as they left the Enforcement Hall, news of Shen Tianchang's removal spread.

At this moment, Luo Tian and Lu Shao had already reached the Promotion Hall, where they saw the people there.

"Congratulations, Master Lu!" As soon as they entered the outer hall, the outer sect disciples who had participated in the trial immediately greeted them respectfully.

"Everyone should go back to your duties. Today, there will be three more trials; each trial can allow one more person to enter the inner sect!" Lu Shao was very pleased with their attitude and felt great joy.

"You go ahead; when your disciple emerges, I'll announce both of you entering the inner sect. I'll personally take your disciple as my student!" Lu Shao spoke to Luo Tian, then stepped into the inner hall. There were still many things he needed to handle.

"Master Zhou Xiong has emerged! Where are the other elders?" People saw Luo Tian and showed surprise. They had felt something was wrong when they saw him leave with Shen Tianchang and Lu Shao.

"Master Zhou Xiong seems to have a good relationship with Master Lu Head; it looks like Master Zhou Xiong's entry into the inner sect is certain!"

"Where is Zhou Yuhan?" Luo Tian scanned the crowd but didn't see Zhou Yuhan's figure, his brows slightly furrowed.

He had already secured his entry into the inner sect; he had let Zhou Yuhan participate in the inner sect trial to prevent any unexpected issues. After all, Eternal Life Mountain had rules—outer sect elders wishing to enter the inner sect must have an inner sect disciple.

As Luo Tian pondered, Zhou Yuhan's figure appeared, his body covered in blood and radiating a powerful aura of death. The crowd shivered at the sight.

"Zhou Yuhan, enter the inner sect!" A Promotion Hall disciple spoke loudly, causing a commotion. The disciple gazed at Zhou Yuhan.

"Two hundred people who entered with Zhou Yuhan didn't emerge!" The crowd was stunned, seeing only Zhou Yuhan appear.

"None of the elders who entered with Master Zhou Xiong emerged either! Could it be..." The crowd gazed at Luo Tian and his disciple, thinking of an unimaginable possibility.

"Outer sect elder Zhou Xiong enters the inner sect; a courtyard is awarded!" As the crowd was in chaos, the disciple spoke again and approached Luo Tian respectfully.

A token was handed to Luo Tian, who accepted it. He nodded at Zhou Yuhan and led him out of the outer hall, walking toward the inner sect under the people's reverent gaze.

"Liu Senior Brother, where are the elders and disciples who entered with Zhou Yuhan and Master Zhou?" As Luo Tian and Zhou Yuhan walked away, the disciples and elders in the hall asked the disciple who had announced it.

"Dead—none remained!" The disciple spoke, and the entire hall fell silent upon hearing it.

"Boom..." A moment later, the whole hall exploded into chaos; people's eyes showed disbelief.

"Since the Promotion Hall was established, it's the first time a senior disciple has killed everyone to enter!" A senior disciple spoke loudly, his voice filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian and Zhou Yuhan quickly reached the courtyard assigned to Luo Tian. Compared to the outer sect's courtyards, this one was much better, with everything available and even disciples assigned to clean it.

"Hard work; rest well tonight. Tomorrow, I have a task for you!" Luo Tian spoke to Zhou Yuhan. Time was limited—only eight days remained, and he needed to prepare. After that, Zhou Yuhan wouldn't be involved anymore; being involved further would only make him a pawn. Moreover, Luo Tian had to consider Zhou Yuhan's safety; if he stayed, his identity would be exposed, and Zhou Yuhan would inevitably die. In the eyes of true masters, who cared about a True Immortal peak-level life?

Time passed slowly. The next day, Zhou Yuhan received an inner sect training mission and left the Eternal Life Mountain.

In a courtyard, Shen Tianchang's face was dark; he had spent great effort to avoid the three years of isolation but now held only the vice-head position.

"Zhou Yuhan left? Went on a training mission?" Shen Tianchang stood there, listening to his subordinates' report. His eyes flashed with cold light.

"Everything is because of that Zhou Xiong. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be in this situation. First, kill his disciple to vent my anger!" Shen Tianchang's body flickered and rushed out of the Eternal Life Mountain toward Zhou Yuhan's direction.

Zhou Yuhan flew through the sky, his mind puzzled. He recalled his master's instructions to head toward the Central Three Heavens and go to Tianyuan Sect.

Tianyuan Sect—Zhou Yuhan had heard of it; recently, it had become prominent in the Central Three Heavens, appearing as the top sect. But Zhou Yuhan couldn't fathom why his master would send him to Tianyuan Sect, as they had no connection.

"Follow your master's orders!" Zhou Yuhan always obeyed his master's words, so he didn't think much and flew toward the Central Three Heavens.

After flying for half a day, he left the Eternal Life Mountain and was about to land on a mountain peak to rest when the world changed. A powerful pressure descended, and a figure stood between heaven and earth, gazing at Zhou Yuhan.

"Blame it on being your master's disciple!" A cold voice echoed, and Shen Tianchang had arrived.

"You..." Zhou Yuhan's face changed in shock; he hadn't expected Shen Tianchang to suddenly appear. The overwhelming pressure made him unable to move.

Shen Tianchang sneered and raised his hand, slamming it toward Zhou Yuhan fiercely. An Immortal King's anger could kill millions; Shen Tianchang's furious strike shattered the void and descended upon Zhou Yuhan's head.

"Done!" Zhou Yuhan's face changed in despair, his eyes filled with hopelessness and no will to fight.

"Buzz..." Just as Zhou Yuhan was desperate, a wave of energy rose before him. A wizened figure appeared beside Zhou Yuhan and extended his hand, colliding with Shen Tianchang's palm.

Chapter 2473: Slashing Shen Tianchang
