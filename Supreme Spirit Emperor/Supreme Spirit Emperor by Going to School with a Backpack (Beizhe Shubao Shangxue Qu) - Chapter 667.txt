“Heavenly Realm!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke, and as their words fell silent, the hall fell into a hush. Luo Tian and his companions seemed to witness visions of mountains of corpses and seas of blood, a land scorched by war.

“Heavenly Realm!”

“It was high time we went to war! The Heavenly Realm people look down on us, believing our Hell is a prison. They guard us!” The hall erupted in chaos, save for Du Jianxing and Jueying Tianzun, who showed no surprise.

“It was merely a temporary decision. These past years, our Reincarnation Hall has surged in strength!”

“A hundred years ago during the Ten Halls’ Grand Competition, we deliberated once, but deemed the timing inauspicious.”

“Over a century, our halls have grown further. Thus, we resolve to attack the Heavenly Realm!”

“But we decree that our Hall’s Holy Sons and Eight Great Kings shall lead the charge, striking first through the Eight Ghost Gates to infiltrate the Heavenly Realm!” Hei Bai Wu Chang addressed the assembly, their gaze settling on Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, I know not what you endured in the Heavenly Realm, but this incursion into the Karmic Gate is vital for Hell. The first battle of your Holy Sons must ignite our Reincarnation Hall’s might!”

“This is also a trial to win the people’s trust,” Hei Bai Wu Chang cautioned, fearing an accident with Luo Tian, for he had once been a Heavenly Realm powerhouse.

“Yes,” Luo Tian bowed, his heart unmoved, yet Fu Xingxuan’s face bore a look of concern.

“Then the Beast Ghost King shall accompany you. You know Wang Gang well, and the faceless commander of the Karmic Gate, Wu Mian, you have met!” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s expression carried worry.

“Also, avoid the Sky Ghost King. You would not prevail in his domain!” Hei Bai Wu Wu Chang warned Luo Tian again.

“Very well. In a month, our Reincarnation Hall’s forces will march. Prepare accordingly!” Hei Bai Wu Chang addressed Luo Tian and the others. They knew sending Luo Tian might bring trouble, but with Fu Xingxuan a woman, they had no alternative.

Hei Bai Wu Chang sought to make Luo Tian the next Hall Master, seizing this moment of his amnesia to turn him against the Heavenly Realm. Unbeknownst to them, Luo Tian was already shunned by the Heavenly Realm; his identity as a disciple of the Ghost Valley and enmity with Eternal Life Mountain had been lost to his amnesia, though the mark of the Ghost Valley no longer marked his back.

“Gather disciples now,” Hei Bai Wu Chang addressed the assembly. “Once war begins, it will last long—Heavenly Realm denizens are no pushovers!”

“Yes,” the hall’s masters bowed swiftly, some eyes filled with worry, others with eagerness.

“Holy Son, in a month, it falls to you! The first battle must showcase our Reincarnation Hall’s might—do not let the other halls outshine us!” The crowd surrounded Luo Tian, smiling.

Luo Tian conversed with them cheerfully as they exited the hall. Outside, disciples swarmed around them.

“Holy Son, a message from Sky Ghost King City: the Sky Ghost King has recovered. He bids you duel him there!” A late-stage True Immortal disciple spoke, face respectful.

“Sky Ghost King?” The disciples’ faces flickered with surprise before the elders and masters erupted in fury.

“Fools, he dares invite Luo Tian!” One master roared, cursing.

“Indeed! Let us raze Sky Ghost King City—what is a king?” The masters echoed.

“Reply to the messenger: twenty days hence, meet at Sky Ghost King City!” Luo Tian ordered.

“Also, send someone to the Karmic Gate—summon my father back to Reincarnation Hall to accompany you to Sky Ghost King City. This feud must end!” Luo Tian added, his voice cold.

“Yes!” The messenger’s face tensed with exhilaration as disciples departed.

Fifteen days later, the Reincarnation Hall’s Holy Sons and Eight Great Kings clashed with Sky Ghost King—news spread swiftly through Hell.

The Ten Kings of Hell had just resolved to attack the Heavenly Realm, yet at this critical moment, a Great King and Ten Kings clashed. This could be minor or major, but it drew Hell’s factions’ attention.

“Good,” the Ten Kings secretly communicated. “Let us divert disciples and forces to the Eight Ghost Gates, preventing news from leaking to the Heavenly Realm.”

Hell’s denizens knew the Reincarnation Hall’s Holy Son and Sky Ghost King’s feud was irreconcilable. Thus, this battle was inevitable.

On one side stood Hell’s renowned Eight Great Kings; on the other, Reincarnation Hall’s Holy Son. Once, Luo Tian had been famed, but then he was still untested.

Now, however, the Ten Kings and even new Great Kings had matured into independent Immortal Sovereigns.

“Come with me to the Infernal Sea Hell,” Du Jianxing told Luo Tian. “Each of the Eighteen Hells is a cultivation haven—this is why the Ten Kings allocated them for the Grand Competition.”

“Good,” Luo Tian nodded, following Du Jianxing and Yu Tian from Reincarnation Hall.

…The Infernal Sea Hell, the third of the Eighteen Hells, now under Reincarnation Hall’s control. This realm was a boundless sea of fire.

A vast mountain stood on the ground, its peak housing the Hell’s entrance. At this moment, five figures appeared atop the mountain—disciples bowed respectfully as five descended.

These were none other than Du Jianxing and Yu Tian, returning from Reincarnation Hall—yet now accompanied by Luo Tian.

“Respectful greetings, Master, Holy Son!” Disciples bowed, faces respectful.

“Arrange accommodations for him,” Du Jianxing ordered Yu Tian and the others before leading Luo Tian into a towering hall.

Upon entering, an endless corridor stretched ahead, flanked by rooms. A searing heat emanated from the corridor’s end, causing Luo Tian to grimace.

“Though your strength lags behind Sky Ghost King’s, you can defend yourself. I know not what trials you’ve faced, but this Infernal Sea Hell is a prime place to elevate your strength!”

Ghosts feared fire, and ghost cultivators were no exception. Here, cultivation speed surged, and one’s endurance was tested.

“Yu Tian reached the middle Immortal Sovereign stage here!”

“Moreover, descend to the lowest level and attempt to refine your body with Purgatory Ghost Flame. That is why I brought you here!” Du Jianxing handed Luo Tian a jade slip.

“Yet refining the Purgatory Immortal Body is arduous; even a minor success would grant you an edge against Sky Ghost King!” Du Jianxing cautioned. Luo Tian’s battle with Sky Ghost King was dire, and he feared for him.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded. He felt his strength lagged behind Sky Ghost King’s, needing enhancement. His body was his forte; refining it could grant him the ability to fight beyond his rank.

“Very well. Go now—don’t venture too deep at first; progress gradually. In fifteen days, your current body strength will suffice to refine the Purgatory Immortal Body to minor success.”

“Yes,” Luo Tian bowed slightly. He had regained freedom, setting aside his search for Leng Qiuchan—his priority was now the battle with Sky Ghost King.

After instructing Luo Tian, Du Jianxing departed to coordinate troop movements toward the Karmic Gate.

Luo Tian marveled at the corridor’s rows of rooms, disciples seated within, cultivating. He smiled, knowing such cultivation privileges were rare. He sensed the disciples’ talents were exceptional.

Chapter 2499: Xiaoqi Has Returned ()

Luo Tian strolled along the corridor, feeling heat intensify. The deeper he ventured, the stronger the disciples’ auras grew.

After half an hour, Luo Tian had not yet reached the end, his brow furrowing.

He quickened his pace, darting deeper. Time passed; after an hour, Luo Tian halted, the air thick with heat. Even he bore a solemn expression.

At this point, the corridor’s rooms were empty—evidently, only True Immortals could endure this.

Luo Tian found a room, seated on the floor, and began cultivating. The chamber was cramped, with only a mat for seating.

“Cultivate!” Luo Tian sat cross-legged, initiating his technique.

He did not seek to elevate his realm but instead refined the Purgatory Immortal Body. He knew reaching middle Immortal Sovereign was arduous; he would need to enhance his body or other methods. Du Jianxing understood this, hence bringing him here.

As the technique activated, a suction force radiated from Luo Tian, drawing heat into his body.

“Sigh… Cultivating the body is agonizing!” Luo Tian muttered, unbothered. He knew to elevate swiftly, he must pay a price.

He sat cross-legged, refining the Purgatory Immortal Body. White smoke billowed from his body, swirling in the chamber.

Time passed; a day had elapsed. The room was thick with white smoke, Luo Tian’s body crimson, like a boiled crab, his skin forming blisters.

“What is this? This heat surpasses even the Heavenly Flame!” Luo Tian inwardly raged.

Yet after a day’s refinement, he adapted to the temperature, like a frog in warm water—numbness set in, and pain faded.

“Next room!” Luo Tian rose, stepping out of the chamber into the corridor.

“How many rooms remain? Ten more—will that be the true Infernal Sea Hell?” Luo Tian mused, gazing at the corridor’s end, shrouded in endless darkness.

He strode forward, leaving a trail of bloodied footprints. Entering the next room, he sat cross-legged again.

This time, two days passed. When Luo Tian emerged, his body bore no unscathed patches.

“What is this pain?” Luo Tian mused silently, now unable to speak—his throat sealed by the searing heat.

One day… two days…

Progressively, Luo Tian advanced room by room toward the corridor’s end. After ten days, he finally stood before the last chamber.

An ancient wooden door loomed ahead, its surface shimmering with faint blue divine laws—evidently, these laws shielded it from the infernal heat. His skin was charred black, like a layer of obsidian armor, yet his eyes burned with vitality.

“I’ll see what this final chamber holds!” Luo Tian muttered, pushing open the door.

A gust of heat surged out, striking Luo Tian’s body. A roar echoed through the corridor.

“Who is it?” Disciples in adjacent rooms opened their eyes, stunned.

“Has he reached the final chamber!”

“The last time was Fire尊者 entering this level,” they murmured, stepping out to witness the overwhelming aura.

“Perhaps it’s the Holy Son,” one mused, recalling seeing Luo Tian briefly.

“Indeed, the Holy Son’s prowess is unmatched—only days to reach this level!” Their faces bore reverence.

“Fire尊者 once endured half a day here, breaking through to middle Immortal Sovereign. I wonder how far the Holy Son will advance!” They exchanged whispers, eager to discuss.

Yet Luo Tian strode into the final chamber, stepping forward—only to find his foot had no ground. His body plummeted downward, revealing the scene below.

“Ah…” screams echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Around him, gray spiritual souls howled, darting frantically, pushed by an unseen force. Some disintegrated into vapor under the heat.

“This is the power of reincarnation!” Luo Tian realized, understanding the force’s effect on spiritual souls but not his body.

Yet he was stunned—below, an endless abyss of black flames loomed. He was falling toward them.

“My heavens…” Luo Tian’s heart raced, sensing this black flame as the most terrifying he had ever seen.

“Must I refine my body in these flames?” Luo Tian mused, activating his technique—plunging into the black inferno.

“Ah…” The searing heat consumed him, forcing a roar from Luo Tian. Yet the pain was excruciating, his cry echoing through the corridor, making disciples grimace—though they had prepared.

Luo Tian felt as if he were burning alive, the black flames seeping into his body—both flesh and soul.

“If he cannot endure, save him!” Outside the final chamber, Yu Tian and Du Jianxing stood. Du Jianxing addressed Yu Tian.

“Yes,” Yu Tian nodded, a gleam of pride in his eyes. Only he could withstand this black flame for a while; even Du Jianxing would not last three hours.

“Let it flow!” Luo Tian chanted his technique, attempting to absorb the black flames into his body.

“Impossible! This flame is terrifying!” Luo Tian inwardly groaned, knowing Du Jianxing would not let him die. Yet the flames were unbearable—Luo Tian felt he could not endure an hour before turning to ash.

From outside, Luo Tian’s form was obscured by flames, as if burning. Time passed; half an hour elapsed. Luo Tian felt himself becoming part of the fire—these flames seemed to be spiritual souls themselves.

“This hell swallows countless souls daily, yet no resentment remains—astonishing!” Luo Tian marveled. He felt himself nearing his limit; when his cultivation was exhausted, that would be his end in this hell.

“Approximately done—burned through?” Yu Tian watched Luo Tian within the black flames, barely discernible.

“I estimate so—his Purgatory Immortal Body should be minorly perfected!” Du Jianxing guessed, speculating Luo Tian’s strength after emerging.

“Wum…”, as Luo Tian endured, Yu Tian prepared to rescue him—sudden fluctuations radiated from Luo Tian’s body.

One… two… nine fluctuations emerged from the part of his head, revealing a streak of color in the black flames.

Nine-colored light radiated, enveloping Luo Tian—a striking sight.

“This is!”
“That boy’s innate flame!” Yu Tian gazed with envy, seeing the nine-colored flame. As a Fire尊者, he had never possessed such power.

The nine-colored flame flickered, seemingly awakening, growing gradually to envelop Luo Tian, countering the black flames.

“Xiaoqi!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled—this was Xiaoqi, who had vanished upon his awakening.

The nine-colored flame’s power was immense but could not withstand the black flames, retreating under pressure.

“Xiaoqi, hold part of it—leave the rest to me!” Luo Tian communicated with Xiaoqi, his heart elated.

Fire endures; life endures. Life does not extinguish fire—this was Luo Tian and Xiaoqi’s bond. When he had unleashed the Heavenly Demon Dissolution, self-destructing all, Xiaoqi vanished with him. Yet due to Reincarnation Hall’s avatar, Xiaoqi had also revived—though severely wounded.

This black flame was formidable for humans but enhanced flames’ power. While Luo Tian cultivated, Xiaoqi also revived.

With Xiaoqi’s aid, Luo Tian endured longer. Compared to his growth, Xiaoqi was not idle—nine-colored flames evolved, gradually adding a tenth color.

“Tenth color!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with joy, sensing Xiaoqi now formidable—capable of harming even Immortal Sovereigns.

Time passed; under Du Jianxing and Yu Tian’s astonished gaze, Luo Tian’s flames turned ten-colored.

Three hours later, Luo Tian reached his limit, his body like charcoal, losing consciousness.

Chapter 2500: Journey to Sky Ghost King City ()

In the dim corridor, disciples bore shock, watching the end. Waves of overwhelming aura emanated constantly.

“Four hours—Holy Son has endured four hours! Even Fire尊者 could not last that long!” They murmured.

“Approximately, the boy cannot endure!” Yu Tian roared, extending a red hand to seize Luo Tian from the black flames.

“Peng…” Sparks flew; Luo Tian’s body was now charcoal-like, radiating heat.

“This is truly burned through!” Yu Tian’s lips twitched—Luo Tian was on the brink of death. If he delayed half an hour more, Luo Tian would be gone.

“Exit!” Du Jianxing smiled, seizing Luo Tian and vanishing.

In an instant, the two carried the charred Luo Tian to the hall’s exterior, laying him on the ground.

“Crack… crack…” A brittle sound echoed from Luo Tian’s body, as if breaking free of a cocoon. Cracks formed, and his charred form gradually faded.

An hour later, Luo Tian still lay motionless, no longer blackened—but Du Jianxing and Yu Tian clearly saw black runes flowing through his body, including his meridians.

“Not minor—mature!” Du Jianxing and Yu Tian gasped, eyes wide at the runes.

Another hour passed; the black runes vanished into Luo Tian’s body, and he slowly opened his eyes.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, heart still racing.

“This is terrifying!” Luo Tian muttered, yet his face soon bore a smile.

“From today, no one can kill you at the early Immortal Sovereign stage!” Du Jianxing smiled, satisfied. The Purgatory Immortal Body’s maturity was unparalleled—nearly immortal unless vastly superior in strength.

“Master Yu, let me strike one punch!” Luo Tian stepped forward, a thunderous sound echoing beneath his feet. His body surged toward Yu Tian.

“Crack…” The earth trembled; Yu Tian took a few steps back, while Luo Tian only retreated one.

“You little brat…” Yu Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief—though he was not adept at body cultivation, he had reached minor Purgatory Immortal Body. Yet Luo Tian had pushed him back.

“Those ten days’ torment was worth it!” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at Du Jianxing: “Master, how many days have I spent in the Infernal Sea Hell?”

“Fourteen,” Du Jianxing’s face shifted slightly.

“I must depart—time is pressing!” Luo Tian leapt into the air, flying out of the black mountain.

…In Sky Ghost King City, chaos reigned. During Luo Tian’s stay in the Infernal Sea Hell, news of Reincarnation Hall’s Holy Son clashing with Sky Ghost King had spread across Hell. Many Hell denizens flocked from all corners to witness this clash.

At the city’s center, a platform held several figures seated, basking in disciples’ reverence. The Ten Kings of Hell’s Holy Sons and current Eight Great Kings sat here—youthful faces, no elders. These individuals would inevitably become Hell’s top powers, mastering its entirety.

“Unbelievable—Luo Chen is Luo Tian! A Heavenly Realm cultivator who thrives in Hell—it’s no wonder he has talent!” A youth spoke, awe-struck, recalling the Ten Halls’ Grand Competition—this man had once crushed them all. He was Ye Qiu of the Yellow Heaven Hall.

“But what底气 does he have to dare fight Sky Ghost King in his city?”

“Watch and see—he’s not foolish; he must have strategies. But what strategies could rival those of the previous Sky Ghost King?” Other Holy Sons whispered.

“He’s not coming, is he?” Yet they waited long—night had fallen, and Luo Tian still did not appear.

Nearby, several Great Kings sat, overhearing the Holy Sons’ remarks. They felt uneasy; they had once dwelled in Reincarnation Hall, fostering deeper ties with it than other halls.

“It’s not the time he defeated us in Holy Son battles—now he acts superior!” Qiu Long muttered, sneering.

“Indeed! I don’t know where their arrogance comes from!”

“But Su Dan, congratulations—double joy: a child and reclaiming the throne!” Hong Tao smiled at the fiery woman, still clad in red. Though she had a child, her figure remained alluring, her aura more enticing.

“Master Hong Tao, you jest—having a child is simple!” Su Dan’s eyes gleamed with mischief. Her every movement exuded seduction, drawing most people’s attention—especially the Ten Holy Sons.

“Such a siren! Too bad she has a child!” The Holy Sons shook their heads.

“I don’t care—she’s a Great King. If I marry her, the demon city would be mine!” Fan Tianyin’s face bore greed, his eyes fixed on Su Dan.

“Besides, such a beauty—sleeping one night is worth it! I’ll try to court her!” Fan Tianyin rubbed his hands, leaving his seat toward Su Dan.

Below the platform stood a woman, flanked by a youth. Though not breathtakingly beautiful, she was undeniably attractive. The youth wore black robes, his body swirling with dark energy beside her.

“Mother, rest assured—today if he dares come, I’ll ensure he never returns, avenging our years of hatred!”

“After preparing for so long, we chased him from the Heavenly Realm to Hell. My strength now rivals his!” The youth’s eyes glowed with eerie intensity, yet softened when gazing at the woman.

“Hope he dares come!” The woman’s eyes flashed with coldness and madness.

“Wum…” As Fan Tianyin stood, two streaks of light descended from the sky, landing on the platform. A middle-aged man and a youth—both radiating formidable power: Luo Tian and Luo Shui.

“Here he comes!” The crowd roared, stunned—Luo Tian had indeed dared to come.

“This is our enemy!” The woman addressed the youth, her body trembling upon seeing Luo Tian.

“Let the old man go first!” The youth held back the woman, his eyes glowing with power.

As Luo Tian landed, a figure stepped onto the platform—calm, clad in black robes, radiating authority. Not Sky Ghost King?

“Father, go to Su Dan—leave the rest to me!” Luo Tian ordered Luo Shui, leading him toward Su Dan.

“Please ensure my father’s safety!” Luo Tian addressed Su Dan and Wang Gang.

“Luo Xiong, rest assured!” Wang Gang vowed. Su Dan’s gaze was resolute, her face showing respect—rarely displaying a blush, drawing the crowd’s wide-eyed stares.

“I can’t take it anymore—time to relieve myself!” Many people left the platform, heading toward Hell’s pleasure quarters.

“Father, sit here!” Su Dan quickly stood, offering Luo Shui a seat—this was Luo Tian’s father.

“Thank you!” Luo Shui knew of Luo Tian and Su Dan’s affair, his face showing satisfaction as he sat.

“Unexpected—your courage!” Sky Ghost King stood on the platform, locking eyes with Luo Tian. Their auras clashed silently.

“Dare or not? I heard you passed the throne to an adopted son—preparing your funeral?” Luo Tian replied, their distance spanning a thousand zhang.

“Wum…” Two realms rose simultaneously, clashing—gray reincarnation streets and green poison realms collided with crackling sounds. Neither could overcome the other.

“On realm mastery, he’s no more than middle Immortal Sovereign—how did this Luo Tian achieve it?” The Ten Holy Sons gaped, watching Luo Tian clash with Sky Ghost King.

“Kill!” After half an hour of stalemate, both moved simultaneously—Sky Ghost King roared, his green poison hand surged toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian remained calm, striking with a fist that collided with the green hand.

“Boom…” Luo Tian was pushed back, while the green poison hand dissolved into a storm of toxic gas, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“This toxin cannot harm me!” Luo Tian smirked, his aura radiating as the toxins struck him. He stepped forward with Huangquan Steps, instantly appearing before Sky Ghost King.

“Impossible!” The crowd gasped—no one dared underestimate Sky Ghost King’s toxin, yet Luo Tian had ignored it.

“It’s his body—his flesh has reached a terrifying level; the toxins cannot penetrate!” Ye Qiu marveled, watching Luo Tian punch段紫觉.

Chapter 2501: Passive ()

“This man is even more terrifying than before—his body is nearly unbreakable!” The Holy Sons marveled, watching Luo Tian and Sky Ghost King clash.

Luo Tian gave no chance for段紫觉 to retreat, engaging in close combat with his formidable body. Each punch struck段紫觉 back, leaving him astonished—Luo Tian was so powerful.

Last time in Reincarnation Hall, Luo Tian had struggled against段紫觉’s palm; now, he had grown so strong in such a short time.

“Unless I’m mistaken, he’s using the Purgatory Immortal Body!” One Holy Son spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

“And it’s perfected!” Ye Qiu’s eyes gleamed with amazement, others equally stunned.

“Mastering a perfected Purgatory Immortal Body—this is worth watching!” The crowd murmured.

“Too strong—he cannot withstand it!” Qiu Long spoke, a body specialist himself, yet he could not resist the toxins!

“Boom… boom…” The platform trembled under Luo Tian and段紫觉’s clash.段紫觉 spat blood, his eyes filled with shock—Luo Tian had pushed him to the edge. His arms bore cracks, trembling slightly.

“Poison Barrier!”段紫觉 knew his body could not match Luo Tian’s, so he seized the moment to form a green toxic barrier, pushing it toward Luo Tian.

At that instant, Luo Tian sensed danger—contact with the toxin would be problematic.

In an instant, the green barrier reached Luo Tian’s front, forcing him back—but the platform was small. Soon, he was pushed to its edge.

“Go…” Sky Ghost King exhaled heavily, exhausted from the close combat pressure. He did not want Luo Tian to get near again.

As he spoke, Sky Ghost King extended his hand, three streaks of light shot forth—upper, middle, and lower routes toward Luo Tian.

“Xiaoqi, rely on you!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his palm flashing with divine light. A roar erupted—flames surged, forming an endless inferno before him.

“What is this fire?” All faces bore fear, gazing at the multi-colored flames.

“Ten-color flame!”

“The last time I saw his fire was seven colors—how did it become ten?” Those recognizing Luo Tian’s flames were stunned.

“Back then, this fire nearly burned down our entire Sky Ghost King City!” The city’s people trembled, recalling that apocalyptic event.

“Sky Ghost King killed him!” The crowd roared, for many had lost or injured loved ones in that fire and apocalyptic thunder.

…As the crowd shouted, the poison barrier clashed with the ten-color flame, producing thick mist. Meanwhile, the three streaks of light pierced through the barrier, instantly reaching Luo Tian’s front—Luo Tian’s face changed.

“Clang… clang…” Blood knives flashed, two sparks flying from Luo Tian’s front—but a cold sensation shot up his right leg.

A knife had pierced his leg, not deep but causing immediate purple discoloration.

“Poisoned!” Luo Tian’s face darkened—instantly, his leg lost sensation and spread outward.

Luo Tian activated his cultivation, hands moving swiftly to suppress the spreading toxin. If it reached his body, trouble would ensue.

“Your poison is effective—recovery won’t be easy!”段紫觉 smiled, watching Luo Tian still.

“Kill!”段紫觉’s hands formed seals, divine laws emerging—thunderous sound as a purple mountain descended upon Luo Tian.

“Can’t move!” Luo Tian felt his leg numb, unable to dodge—only choice was to endure.

As he spoke, Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, summoning Purgatory Ghost Claws from a black vortex to strike the purple mountain.

“Boom…” The collision of the purple mountain and Purgatory Ghost Claws sent waves of power cascading from Luo Tian’s head, striking him.

“Luo Tian is immobilized—his toxin has made him passive!” The crowd realized instantly. Everyone knew段紫觉’s poison was unparalleled in Hell.

“Boy, how are you? I haven’t used my full strength yet—can you endure?”段紫觉 smiled, his hands changing seals continuously to prevent Luo Tian from expelling the toxin.

“Boom… boom…” The thunderous sound continued—Luo Tian could only stand still, passively enduring the toxin’s erosion.
