“Man Hun!” After carefully observing, Luotian and his companions instantly recognized the figure seated upon the altar—it was Man Hun, who had regained his colossal form.

Beside Man Hun’s immense body sat Tu Feiyang, his face etched with solemnity.

“What is wrong with them?” Fu Xingyue asked, her voice laced with confusion. Yet she hesitated to step onto the altar immediately; Sun Mengru’s earlier words had instilled a deep sense of caution.

“Ascend, for this altar holds boundless benefits!” A weathered voice echoed within Luotian’s mind—the spirit of the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

Chapter 1,519: The Monotony of Cultivation

“What is this altar?” Sun Mengru murmured. The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda and the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree held immense authority over the Ascension Site of the Heaven-Devouring Lord. They might possess clues about this altar’s origin.

“This is indeed an Ascension Altar, but it was not the Heaven-Devouring Lord’s creation. He discovered this altar and restored it. Perhaps it was left by an even older entity. Whether he ascended or attained Nirvana remains unknown,” the spirit of the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda replied softly, its tone tinged with reverence for the Heaven-Devouring Lord.

“This altar was where the master chose to ascend in his final days. He left me and Qian with a promise: two beams of guiding light would descend, and after their arrival, the cultivation boon he left for our new master would awaken,” the spirit continued, its voice carrying a faint sorrow.

“Beneath this altar lies the countless ancient royal clan warriors the master subdued. With unparalleled methods, he extracted their cultivation and left it for those destined to absorb,” the spirit’s ethereal form explained further.

“WHAT!” Fu Xingyue and her siblings’ faces paled instantly at the spirit’s words.

They knew well how many ancient royal clan warriors the Heaven-Devouring Lord had slain—a terrifying number that had crippled the ancient clans. The refinement of such immense cultivation into pure essence would be an unfathomable power.

Luotian’s heart pounded with exhilaration as he observed Man Hun and Tu Feiyang seated upon the altar. Their decision to abandon the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda in favor of deeper exploration was a testament to their courage.

“Let’s go!” Luotian acted without hesitation, stepping onto the vast altar and rushing toward its center.

Sun Mengru, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingxuan, and Fu Xinyang followed swiftly, their gazes fixed on the altar’s heart.

“Boom…!” As they neared, Luotian heard the thunderous reverberations from Man Hun and Tu Feiyang’s bodies, their auras steadily rising.

“Do you think we can reach the Epoch Peak?” Luotian asked no questions, immediately entering meditation with his Cyclic Heaven Technique.

Sun Mengru and the others also knelt beside him, their hearts ablaze with desire for this unparalleled boon. They unleashed their techniques and began cultivating.

“Clang…!” As they settled,一道道 gray spiritual seals materialized from the altar, instantly entwining their bodies.

“Hum…” Luotian’s mind trembled as he felt himself transported into another realm. Countless golden and white figures materialized before his eyes.

“Are these manifestations of Holy Power and Epoch Energy?” Luotian realized instantly, then unleashed his Cyclic Heaven Technique toward the figures.

Yet he soon marveled—his technique could not even stir them.

“Roar…!” The figures then howled, their golden Holy Power forms charging toward Luotian.

“Ten… a hundred… a thousand…” Over a thousand golden figures surged toward him.

Though Luotian did not grasp their meaning, he understood this was a trial. He summoned his pure white hand and smashed downward.

The colossal hand struck, shattering nearly half the figures.

“Boom…!” The golden forms exploded into streams of Holy Power, drifting through space. Luotian smiled, then unleashed another Epoch Hand to obliterate the remaining figures.

The thousand golden forms shattered in a whirlwind of power, leaving Luotian awestruck.

“Such dense Holy Power could elevate a Holy Lord from the initial to middle stage!” Luotian inhaled, absorbing the drifting essence into his body.

“Boom…!” His dantian roared as his cultivation slowly ascended—though only slightly, it brought a smile to his face. Countless more Holy Power and Epoch Energy figures still loomed ahead.

“Begin!” Luotian waved his hand, and the Cyclic Heaven Technique swept over a thousand figures.

“Roar…!” A thousand Holy Power phantoms charged him, but Luotian’s Epoch Hand shattered them instantly. The purified Holy Power drifted through space, absorbed by him.

Others faced the same fate, their faces alight with joy as they devoured the figures.

“Haha! My fortune is unmatched!” Tu Feiyang laughed maniacally, shattering the final batch of Holy Power figures. He felt his power surge and sneered.

“Luotian, did you expect this boon after abandoning the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda’s contest? When I reach Epoch Peak, even a pseudo-Warlord, I’ll crush you beneath my feet!” Tu Feiyang’s technique enveloped the white figures without hesitation.

“Roar…!” The white figures radiated immense power, charging toward Tu Feiyang.

“Damn…” Tu Feiyang’s face twisted as he realized his mistake—he faced Epoch Energy, not Holy Power.

“Hundred… two hundred…” Dozens of white figures surged toward him, their overwhelming might forcing Tu Feiyang to act swiftly. Otherwise, he would have faced tens of thousands of Epoch Energy figures, which could have cost him his life.

Yet even hundreds left Tu Feiyang in a quandary, cursing as he rushed toward them.

On the altar, seven figures sat in meditation, their eyes closed. Gray spiritual seals danced upon their bodies as their auras rose gradually—though they were at the Epoch Late Stage, reaching Peak required time. Their progress was remarkable.

Time knew no bounds; they endured the longest cultivation, honing their patience.

“One day… a hundred days…” Time passed slowly, and a year had elapsed.

“Boom!” Luotian shattered a white Epoch Energy figure with a punch, sighing deeply. “A year to form one Cyclic Immortal Body! This is too slow!”

“It’s getting harder,” he muttered. “How long will it take to form the second?” This was Luotian’s first prolonged cultivation, and he felt the monotony.

“Epoch Mid-Stage figures—come forth!” Luotian pointed, and five Epoch Energy figures surged toward him.

…

“Epoch Mid-Stage… Epoch Late Stage…” As time passed, their progress slowed. Though the figures were weaker than true peers, they were no mere mass-killers.

Five years passed; their advancements varied. Luotian, after five years of refinement, reached the Epoch Late Stage figures, while others still battled Mid-Stage.

“Boom!” Luotian could only fight three at once, avoiding risks. Each Epoch Late Stage figure he destroyed was a test of solitude and endurance, eventually shaping his second Cyclic Immortal Body.

Another five years of relentless battles saw Luotian’s two Cyclic Immortal Bodies fully formed, though the Epoch Late Stage figures slowed his progress.

“Haha! I’ve reached Epoch Peak!” Tu Feiyang stood in the empty space, shattering an Epoch Late Stage figure. His body radiated overwhelming power, his laughter filled with arrogance.

Moments later, Man Hun also ascended to Epoch Peak, roaring into the sky.

“Continue—see if we can reach pseudo-Warlord!” Man Hun roared, charging another Epoch Late Stage figure.

“Directly seek Epoch Peak—this Epoch Late Stage is useless to me!” Luotian pointed, unleashing his Cyclic Heaven Technique on a towering white figure.

“Boom…!” The white figure erupted, charging toward Luotian with a deafening roar. Luotian’s eyes gleamed as he met the attack head-on.

Chapter 1,520: The Emergence of Ancient Clan Heirs

The white figure radiated immense power, charging toward Luotian. His eyes flashed as he launched a punch.

“Boom!” The white figure exploded under his fist, its chaotic energy slamming into Luotian’s body. He staggered back a thousand feet, blood spilling from his arm.

“An attack equivalent to Epoch Peak!” Luotian murmured, catching his breath before seizing the surging Epoch Energy.

“Hum…” The ninth Cyclic Immortal Body formed within Luotian’s dantian, a smile spreading across his face.

“Though wounded, this pain is worth it!” Luotian’s lips curled as he pointed, summoning a figure of Epoch Peak power. It surged toward him.

“One… two…” Time passed, and Luotian shattered countless Epoch Peak figures. His final Cyclic Immortal Body slowly took shape.

A decade passed; as Luotian and his companions honed their strength in the Mortal Realm, the Nine Domains underwent seismic changes.

The Tenth Domain, Origin Domain, fully connected with Thunder and Mortal Domains. The Ancient Clan emerged openly before humanity.

Without seals, the Ancient Clans flourished, producing prodigies. A shocking revelation sent shockwaves through the Nine Domains: Ancient Clan heirs emerged, with some reaching pseudo-Warlord status. For instance, the golden crow clan’s elder Jinwu and Man Hun clan’s elder Sasman attained pseudo-Warlord status. This news thrilled the Ancient Clans.

Humanity, though advancing rapidly, still lagged behind. Once, humanity had a single Epoch Peak master, Xuanbing Elder, barely ascending to the peak. He could not match Jinwu Fuben’s Epoch Peak prowess.

Nearly two decades passed; humanity made great strides. Some sects and clans’ Epoch Masters, or their disciples, broke free from seals. Characters like Diao Dezhu and Sun Shengtian reached Epoch Peak, but true Epoch Masters—ancient titans like Gutianshu, Ji Jiuyou, and Dongbo Xin—remained unmatched.

Though years passed and the Ancient Clans grew stronger, they dared not invade the Nine Domains. Gutianshu, Dongbo Xin, and Ji Jiuyou’s past震慑 still loomed. Though pseudo-Warlords multiplied, the Ancient Clans hesitated to confront these titans, honoring their pact: no Epoch Peak masters would emerge.

“Boom!” The thunderous sound echoed as Luotian smiled, having spent a decade to form his final Cyclic Immortal Body, reaching Epoch Peak.

“Haha…” His laughter rang out beneath the gray sky. Two crimson lights pierced the void, a figure radiating overwhelming power standing tall—Tu Feiyang, his long hair飞扬, his body exuding terrifying energy. Gray spiritual seals shattered around him.

“Though I haven’t reached pseudo-Warlord, I’ll soon. This opportunity saved me millions of years of cultivation—worth every moment!” Tu Feiyang muttered, then gazed at Luotian and the others still bound by spiritual seals.

“Luotian!” Tu Feiyang gritted his teeth, eyes flashing with malice toward the seated Luotian.

“Roar…” Man Hun’s colossal form rose, his eyes alight with excitement.

“Man Hun!” Tu Feiyang’s face lit with a grin, nodding toward the seated Luotian.

“Luotian!” Man Hun’s eyes turned icy, his aura rising as he locked gazes with Tu Feiyang.

“Kill him?” Tu Feiyang grinned, eyeing Luotian to seize the moment.

“Good!” Man Hun nodded, his蛮荒 power surging as he lifted a foot to stomp down.

“Hum…” As Man Hun’s foot rose, an icy chill swept the world, making both men shiver.

A purple light flashed before Man Hun’s raised foot, slicing downward.

“Plop…” Blood flowed from Man Hun’s foot, and he withdrew it in disbelief, gazing at the attacker.

“Xingxuan!” Man Hun’s face burned with fury, staring at Xingxuan who stood before Luotian.

“Xingxuan, step aside! Luotian is a threat to our clans. If he lives, our path to enlightenment is too uncertain!” Tu Feiyang spoke softly but with a hint of desperation—his respect for Luotian was evident.

“You’re so weak, sneaking attacks?” Xingxuan coldly replied, her gaze sweeping over Man Hun and Tu Feiyang before settling on them with disdain.

“Hum…” As the three spoke, a powerful aura returned. Sun Mengru stood coldly, walking toward Luotian with her golden sword in hand, eyes icy as she faced Man Hun and Tu Feiyang.

“You dare defy us!” Sun Mengru’s cold demeanor returned, her aura surging toward the two.

“Humanity!” Tu Feiyang and Man Hun’s eyes narrowed, finally noticing Sun Mengru. Her aura pressed upon them with immense pressure.

“Tu Feiyang, Man Hun, you’ve truly grown!” Xingyue and Xinyang stood, their auras radiating Epoch Peak power. Their faces darkened at the sight of the two.

Their words left the pair pale, then they gritted their teeth: “We’ll take our leave!”

They turned to flee from the Mortal Realm, no longer seeking deeper exploration. Their Epoch Peak status made them feel a profound danger in the Mortal Realm’s depths, as if further progress meant true death. Their gains were enough; they didn’t wish to risk more.

Yet as they took their first steps, a terrifying pressure descended upon them, pinning them in place.

“Where are you going?” A cold voice echoed through the world, making their eyes narrow.

“Luotian!” Sun Mengru and Xingxuan turned, surprised to see Luotian standing. His body shimmered with light as he walked toward Man Hun and Tu Feiyang.

“Luotian, what do you intend?” Man Hun and Tu Feiyang’s hearts fluttered as they approached. Though sensing Luotian was at Epoch Peak, they felt his presence more fearsome.

“Boom…” Luotian took slow steps toward them, each footfall making their hearts race.

“Nothing much—just ask you to delay your return to the clan for a few days!” Luotian smiled, his voice calm. Yet Tu Feiyang and Man Hun felt an overwhelming strength in his words, a force they couldn’t resist.

“By what right?” Tu Feiyang asked, fear in his voice but still defiant.

“By this!” Luotian’s body闪动, his feet slamming onto the altar. He vanished from sight, appearing before Tu Feiyang in an instant, then launched a punch.

The thunderous sound echoed as his white fist, radiating overwhelming power, collapsed the void and struck Tu Feiyang’s chest.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed, and Tu Feiyang was sent flying, his face pale with disbelief. His chest caved in.

“How is this possible!” Tu Feiyang spat blood, his voice trembling.

“Hiss…” The others gasped, their gazes on Luotian, stunned by his terrifying power after reaching Epoch Peak.

“Cyclic Body has fully matured—unparalleled flesh!” Sun Mengru murmured, observing Luotian. As a Primordial Divine Body, her flesh was formidable, but she felt her own would not match Luotian’s.

“Terrifying—humanity’s nine divine bodies at full maturity are this fearsome!” Xingyue and the others murmured, their eyes alight with a hint of joy.

“Luotian!” Tu Feiyang stood slowly, his mind awestruck but as a prodigy, he would not easily surrender. Even if Luotian was powerful, retreating without a fight wasn’t his style.

“Hum…” Blood Epoch Energy radiated from Tu Feiyang, who knew his flesh couldn’t match Luotian’s. But he had speed and techniques.

Red light flashed, Tu Feiyang’s body vanished from their sight. Even with their Epoch Peak power, they couldn’t catch his form.

Chapter 1,521: Departing the Mortal Realm

“Where?” Luotian’s brow furrowed, his eyes flashing with violet light. His vast spiritual awareness spread to locate Tu Feiyang.

“Hum…” With his Purple Eye of the Abyss and spiritual awareness, Luotian found a single red light flying through the void. He couldn’t track its path.

“Come out!” Luotian waved his hand, launching a fist that pierced the void. A clear sound echoed from within.

After the sound, a cold voice followed: a blood-red light sliced through the void and appeared behind Luotian. The crimson spear pierced his back, sinking three inches before stopping, blood flowing into the spear.

“Finally revealed!” Luotian laughed, turning to grab Tu Feiyang’s body with his white hand.

“What kind of flesh is this!” Tu Feiyang was stunned, unable to believe his powerful strike had no effect on Luotian.

As Tu Feiyang gaped, Luotian’s hand struck his body, sending him crashing onto the gray altar.

“Fierce God’s Wrath—Crush Nine Heavens!” Luotian murmured, his golden foot descending toward Tu Feiyang, who was embedded in the altar.

“Clang…!” As Luotian raised his foot, Tu Feiyang felt a life-threatening danger. He transformed into blood, scattering across the altar and fleeing.

“Boom…” Though Tu Feiyang escaped quickly, he was still hit slightly, blood splattering.

The hum echoed as Tu Feiyang appeared before them, his face pale. His eyes turned fierce, and he rapidly moved his hands.

“Eight Seas of Emerald Snow Overwhelming Heaven!” Tu Feiyang murmured, his voice cold. His Epoch Energy poured from his body like water, spreading a blood-scented aura across the altar.

Thick blood mist enveloped them, making it hard to breathe.

“Roar…” Eight crimson dragons of blood surged toward Luotian, as if to devour him.

“Man Hun, why are you still watching? Help me—this one wants to block us!” Tu Feiyang called out, his voice urgent.

“New techniques?” Luotian muttered, facing the nine blood dragons without fear. His fists were his best weapons, and he launched them toward the dragons.

“Boom…” In an instant, Luotian collided with the first dragon, its blood energy dissipating on his chest. The invisible waves pushed him back two steps.

As he steadied himself, the second dragon struck. Luotian’s eyes finally showed concern as he launched another punch.

The thunderous sound echoed repeatedly, and with each dragon’s destruction, Luotian retreated further.

The ninth dragon was stronger than the rest, leaving Luotian’s face pale.

“Luotian is too变态! This can still withstand!” Fu Xingyue and the others gasped, watching Luotian retreat.

“Clang…!” The eighth dragon vanished from sight, and Luotian had retreated a thousand feet.

But before he could steady himself, a massive foot with complex patterns descended upon him, crushing like a pest.

“Get lost…” Luotian showed no fear against Man Hun’s foot, raising his hands to block.

“Still blocking Man Hun’s Seven Stomps!” Fu Xingyue and the others were stunned, surprised Luotian would do this again.

“Die!” Man Hun’s face showed disdain, confident in his Seven Stomps. After all, he was at Epoch Peak, and Luotian’s performance, though strong, couldn’t match the Man Clan’s flesh.

“Crack…” Thunder roared as the gray altar trembled three times. Luotian bent slightly, his hands raised to block Man Hun’s foot.

Yet Man Hun’s foot remained in the air, his face filled with disbelief.

“It’s my turn!” A cold voice echoed as Luotian appeared before Man Hun, ascending into the air. His fifth step of the Seven Stomps struck.

“Boom…!” A golden foot rose from Luotian’s feet, its power more terrifying than Man Hun’s.

“Roar…” The massive Man Hun roared, taking his fifth step of the Seven Stomps.

A golden and gray foot collided on the altar, shaking all present.

“Boom…” The gray foot shattered under the golden one, landing on Man Hun’s massive body.

“Boom…” The colossal body crashed to the ground, Man Hun’s face pale as he gazed at Luotian in mid-air. His eyes showed defeat.

“Completely defeated!” Man Hun muttered, his spirit broken. Luotian’s flesh was too terrifying to challenge.

“Hum…” Without hesitation, Luotian released gray spiritual seals from his hands, their powerful sealing force entering Man Hun’s body. Man Hun regained clarity.

“Luotian, what do you mean?” Man Hun shouted, his voice filled with anger.

“Nothing—just the same words: let you all suffer a little!” Luotian smiled, addressing Man Hun.

“Hum…” As they spoke, a blood-red spear sliced through the void toward Luotian’s throat.

“Warm-up is over—time to return!” Luotian smiled, then grabbed the spear with his hand.

“Clink…!” A piercing sound echoed as Fu Xingyue and the others gaped—Luotian had grabbed the sharp spear with his hand.

“How is this possible!” The void echoed with disbelief, making Luotian’s lips curl slightly.

“Come out—this time, you won’t escape!” Luotian roared, and gray spiritual threads shot from his body, following the blood-red spear into the void.

“Hum…” As Luotian’s words faded, his hand tightened, pulling upward.

With this pull, Tu Feiyang’s body appeared before Luotian. The gray spiritual threads connected him to Luotian, trapping Tu Feiyang in his grasp.

“Crack…” Then, Luotian’s other hand seized Tu Feiyang’s neck. His face smiled at Tu Feiyang: “Try your luck this time—find a way to escape from me!”

“…” Tu Feiyang’s face turned red and pale alternately before he spoke: “What exactly do you want?”

“Just as I said—let my wife and I safely leave the Mortal Realm. I’ll release you two. Rest assured, I have curse power—why would I kill you to cause trouble for myself?”

As he spoke, Luotian sealed Tu Feiyang and placed him before Man Hun. Fu Xingyue and the others gazed with admiration.

“Tragic—just reached Epoch Peak, now a prisoner!” Fu Xinyang murmured, watching Man Hun and Tu Feiyang.

Hearing Fu Xinyang’s unhidden mockery, Tu Feiyang and Man Hun turned pale. They had strong hidden cards but knew if they died, their clans would immediately learn, and the pseudo-Warlords would pressure humanity, possibly sparking another war between the Ancient Clans and Humanity.

“Let’s go!” Luotian waved his hand, collecting Tu Feiyang and Man Hun. He addressed Sun Mengru and the others.

“Hmph, we’ve been out for a long time. Especially here on this altar, over twenty years have passed. I wonder what the situation is now!” Fu Xingxuan murmured, then flashed away toward the Mortal Realm.

“Twenty years!” Luotian muttered, then took Sun Mengru’s hand, his eyes flickering with regret. He followed Fu Xingxuan out of the Mortal Realm.

The journey was uneventful, taking three days to reach the stars of the Mortal Domain. They sighed in relief.

After another day’s flight, they finally returned to the Star Moon Clan’s base in the Mortal Domain. Their faces slightly trembled.

“Things have changed so much!” Fu Xingyue marveled, gazing at the bustling continent. It was even more prosperous than before—like a second Origin Domain.

“Who are those people? It’s the Divine Emperor!” Their appearance immediately caught the Star Moon Clan’s attention, and they recognized them instantly.

“Hail the Divine Emperor!” A chorus of voices echoed as people bowed respectfully, gazing at Fu Xingxuan, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xinyang. Sun Mengru was hidden by Luotian’s special means.

“Divine Emperor, you left the Star Moon Clan two decades ago with the two military masters. We didn’t expect your return!”

“Didn’t you notice the Divine Emperor’s power? He has reached Epoch Peak! The two military masters have also attained Epoch Peak!” The Star Moon Clan murmured, their eyes filled with reverence for Fu Xingxuan and the others.

“Epoch Peak—our newly emerged Ancient Clan heir also reached Epoch Peak. We didn’t expect the Divine Emperor and two military masters to achieve such power!” They gazed at Fu Xingxuan, who shone like three brilliant stars.

“Rise!” Fu Xingxuan addressed the crowd, then led Luotian and Fu Xingyue toward the Star Moon Clan’s pseudo-Warlord’s secluded domain.

“Back already?” In a world-like hall, the Star Moon Clan’s pseudo-Warlord, Fu Cangshan, sat. Fu Wenbin sat beside him, his eyes alight with joy.

“Pseudo-Warlord!” Luotian felt an unfathomable aura from Fu Wenbin, then his heart trembled.

“Originally a step into pseudo-Warlord, now he has ascended—nothing surprising!” Luotian mused, his eyes filled with respect.

He also saw a young man seated beside Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin, alongside two Epoch Peak elders and the newly ascended Fu Tianqing. This young man’s status in the Star Moon Clan was evident.

Seeing Fu Tianqing reach Epoch Peak, Luotian felt joy—Fu Tianqing had treated him kindly, like a true disciple.

“Glad you’re back. Your power has improved. I didn’t expect twenty years to bring you to Epoch Peak!” Fu Cangshan smiled, nodding at Fu Xingxuan and the others, now resembling General San Si.

The Ancient Clans’ Star Moon Clan was already powerful. Now, Fu Xingxuan, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xinyang had all reached Epoch Peak—unlike other clans. This made the Star Moon Clan exceptionally strong, its top-tier combat power enough to be the strongest among Ancient Clans.

“I’ll introduce you!” Fu Cangshan spoke, gazing at the young man with a cold demeanor.

“This is our Star Moon Clan’s heir, Fu Tu. He awakened eight years ago,” Fu Cangshan told Fu Xingxuan and the others, his voice carrying a hint of joy.

Hearing Fu Cangshan’s words, Fu Xingxuan and the others showed respect, bowing to Fu Tu. Luotian followed suit, nodding respectfully—after all, he was still the commander of Star Moon Guard.

“Hmph!” Fu Tu nodded, then surveyed Luotian and the others before focusing on Luotian and Fu Xingyue.

“You are that human?” Fu Tu spoke softly, his voice laced with disdain. After all, he was a high-ranking figure; to him, humans were mere ants in ancient times.
