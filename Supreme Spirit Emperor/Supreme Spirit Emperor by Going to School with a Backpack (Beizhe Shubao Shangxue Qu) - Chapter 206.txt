Chapter 923: The People of the Demon Domain

As Luotian's words fell, a thunderous sound like a clap of thunder echoed in the sky. Chen Zhanbiao swung his arms, two fists pounding forward, repelling a rhinoceros that was dozens of times larger than himself. His face bore an unwillingness as he flew back into the crowd.

"Big brother, why did you stop? I was just getting started!" Chen Zhanbiao spoke, his face filled with confusion as he gazed at Luotian.

"Enough, enough. Be obedient!" Luotian smiled and comforted Chen Zhanbiao, then glanced at the rhinoceros above, whose form was now pitifully battered.

It was tragic. When the rhinoceros had restored its true form, it radiated a brilliant blue light, its horns gleaming with cold brilliance, making people shiver. Now, the rhinoceros was pitifully wounded, its massive body mostly stained with blood. Its sharp hooves were cracked, as if they could shatter at the slightest touch, sending chills through onlookers.

"Boom..." The massive body fell to the ground, swaying slightly before collapsing from exhaustion, emitting thick white smoke from its mouth.

The energy waves spread outward as the rhinoceros reverted to its true form, its previously darkened face now pale like a sheet of paper, breathing heavily.

On the other side, the guard trapped by the Wanlingkong array was equally pitiful, groaning endlessly. Its eyes were vacant, unable to even manifest its true form, collapsing weakly on the ground.

Luotian waved his hand, golden holy power shooting forth from his fingers, forming a blade of golden light that sliced through the guard.

"Boom..." Waves of energy erupted from the guard, transforming into golden seals that spread across its body.

At the same time, the guard was drenched in blood, its face pale and trembling as it gazed at Wanlingkong with a flicker of fear.

"Two, your two friends' strength is evident; they are no match for the Transcendent Realm. May we enter the Demon Domain?" Luotian's voice was calm, his face smiling as he addressed the two identical guards.

"No more, no more. The Demon Domain values strength above all. Your two friends have won our respect. We've guarded here for ten years; after ten years, we welcome you to visit the Rhinoceros Clan!" The two guards, their faces filled with admiration, nodded at Chen Zhanbiao and Wanlingkong.

"Tsk tsk! The Demon Domain's people are quite endearing, far stronger than ordinary sect disciples!" Gulei's face bore a tone of admiration as he gazed at the two pale-faced guards.

Others secretly admired them; if these were ordinary sect disciples, they would have already threatened and plotted revenge. Yet these two guards showed no resentment but instead admiration for the group, which was quite endearing.

"Good, you two can also visit Fire Domain and pay us a visit at Tongtian Sect. I am Luotian; if you have any troubles, come to Fire Domain!" Luotian smiled and bowed at the two guards, handing them two Holy Grade Primary Elixirs.

"Medicinal pills!" The two guards stared at the golden elixirs, their faces showing a flicker of surprise before their eyes turned red. They stared at the Holy Grade Primary Elixirs in their hands, breathing heavily as they gazed at Luotian.

Though the Demon Domain looked down on array masters and seal artisans, it revered alchemists, as they could truly enhance one's strength. Beastmen rarely became alchemists due to their physical and mental constraints.

"Indeed, these are Holy Grade Primary Elixirs; nothing too special. Just eat them, and take these three for now. I like your character, so consider us friends!" Luotian smiled and spoke to them.

Hearing Luotian's words, the two guards were surprisingly honest. Luotian was a Holy Rank Early Stage powerhouse; their entire Rhinoceros Clan had only two Holy Rank Early Stage beasts. Thus, they had previously shown no respect for Luotian out of the clan's support from the Holy City.

"Big brother, why befriend them? They're all food! I'm hungry!" Chen Zhanbiao's face bore a trace of resentment as he gazed at the two guards, causing them to tremble slightly and look at Chen Zhanbiao with fear. His gaze was too terrifying.

"Zhanbiao, I'll feed you later!" Luotian sighed, patting his head and signaling Xu Liyi to comfort Chen Zhanbiao.

"Two, could you tell us about the Ancient Heaven Palace? You must have realized we're here for it!" Luotian addressed them.

Hearing Luotian's words, the two guards' faces changed, gazing at him with caution: "Luotian, you must have noticed we're from the Rhinoceros Clan. I am Xin Zhen, and this is my younger brother, Xin Zhuang!"

Luotian looked at the two identical men and inwardly sighed. Next time, he would still be unable to recognize them.

"Luotian, I'll tell you the truth: you can't go to the Ancient Heaven Palace. It's full of dangers; all nine domains' forces have gathered here, rushing into the Holy City. There are countless people of Holy Rank Early Stage and Transcendent Realm; even with your group, you can't handle it!" Xin Zhuang spoke with concern, not wanting Luotian to die in vain.

"Also, brother, I'm saying this honestly. That Ancient Heaven Palace is so elusive; do you really believe it? How many Holy Rank Early Stage people have died there, never to return? So brother, you should avoid it!" Xin Zhuang spoke with sincerity.

"Indeed, Luotian, Fire Domain people are often looked down upon by the other domains. I advise you not to go! Your nature might cause conflicts, and then..." Xin Zhen spoke with concern, adding.

"Ha! They're not easy to deal with! I'm not a pushover either! If they want to step on me, they should be ready to lose a piece of flesh!" Luotian's face bore battle intent, his eyes filled with endless confidence.

"Brave!" Xin Zhen and Xin Zhuang nodded in admiration, speaking loudly with resounding voices, their eyes filled with respect.

"Brother, although our Rhinoceros Clan isn't among the Eight Holy Clans, we hold considerable power within the Demon Domain. Our status is second only to the Eight Holy Clans. These are our tokens; if you encounter trouble in the Heaven Palace, you can seek help from our Rhinoceros Clan."

Xin Zhen and Xin Zhuang spoke sincerely, handing their tokens to Luotian.

"Good, brothers! If you have any trouble, I'll do my best to help!" Luotian was also open-minded, handing his token to Xin Zhuang and Xin Zhen before leading the group to depart.

With many people, Luotian summoned his ancient warship, guiding everyone into it and steering the ship toward the depths of the Demon Domain.

Sitting on the warship, Luotian produced various foods and drinks, beginning to chat. He also introduced Nan Gong Yuying and Gulei to Du Hongtao and Lu Han.

With Gulei, Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi, and others as talkative individuals, there was no need for Luotian to speak; they opened their mouths immediately, discussing why they had arrived here.

Indeed, these people had all entered the Transcendent Realm. Even Chen Zhanbiao and Wanlingkong, who hadn't entered the Transcendent Realm, were fearless against it. In fact, most Transcendent Realm beings couldn't match them.

They were all restless individuals; how could they stay in the Four Holy Star Domains? After mutual encouragement, they had planned to leave the Four Holy Star Domains and come to Fire Domain, seeking Luotian and also searching for opportunities to enhance their cultivation.

Upon arriving in Fire Domain, they had heard of Luotian's name at Tongtian Sect. They felt instinctively that this Luotian was the one they knew, and upon hearing about the Ancient Heaven Palace's news, they realized Luotian would definitely go there. Thus, they halted their journey to Tongtian Sect and directly sought the entrance to the Demon Domain.

"You all!" Luotian sighed, shaking his head as he gazed at these familiar faces. His heart felt warm; he knew they had followed him out of concern for his safety.

"Ghahaha, Luotian, you can't run this time! We're going to chat for three days and nights!" Zheng Xin and the talkative group surrounded Luotian, speaking endlessly again, causing Luotian to be exasperated.

Du Yuying watched Luotian's embarrassed face with a smile; it was the first time she had seen Luotian in a pickle, which wasn't common.

Du Hongtao and Lu Han also smiled at Luotian; this was the real Luotian.

They both felt that Luotian's friends were no ordinary people; their future achievements would definitely be high. A Fire Domain could not contain these individuals.

The group marched toward the Holy City of the Demon Domain, but Luotian was not idle. His powerful spiritual sense continuously scanned the surroundings, sensing the environment.

The Demon Domain was far stronger than Fire Domain; people kept passing by the ancient warship, transforming into streaks of light toward the center and Holy City. Each person radiated a fierce aura, clearly beasts in human form.

Luotian chatted with Zheng Xin while observing the surroundings vigilantly, as this was the Demon Domain, and it was currently chaotic. Elite forces from all domains were gathering here.

The ancient warship was unusually noticeable, but with Luotian, Du Hongtao, and Lu Han—three Holy Rank Early Stage masters—and many Transcendent Realm beings, no one dared to cause trouble on the ship.

Time passed slowly; Luotian's group drifted through the star domain for seven days before finally reaching the heart of the Demon Domain, the core area of the Beast Clan's Holy City.

Chapter 924: The Strength of the Demon Domain

Under the starry sky of the Demon Domain, a massive planet shone brilliantly, radiating pure light like crystal, suspended in space.

The Demon Domain's Holy City, the most core region of the entire domain. Even the strongest from the Nine Domains, like the Mortal Domain's elites, feared it deeply. The entire Demon Domain was united; if the Holy City issued a command, countless beasts would rush to obey.

The black ancient warship slowly sailed forward as it approached the Demon Domain, and more figures appeared. Now, Luotian's spiritual sense detected not only beasts but also human traces. Those who could enter the Demon Domain had at least Transcendent Realm cultivation. Streaks of light flashed past the ship, rushing into the crystalline planet.

This planet was essentially a vast city. From afar, Luotian could sense several ancient and powerful auras emanating from the Holy City, leaving him in awe.

"Roar..." A deep roar echoed through the starry sky as two earth dragons approached from afar, walking on empty space. Long reins were tied around their necks, extending behind them and pulling a massive war chariot.

The earth dragons themselves were over ninety feet long, and the chariot was as large as a small star, an awe-inspiring sight.

What stunned everyone was that someone dared to use earth dragons for transport in the Demon Domain. Though earth dragons were low-level dragon clans, this one was a Supreme Rank earth dragon. To have such a beast pull a chariot indicated the rider's identity was extremely high.

"Divine Clan!" Luotian noticed a golden banner with the character "Divine" fluttering high on the chariot. His eyes narrowed, and his spiritual sense probed the ship but found it impossible to penetrate the chariot's aura. He could only see a group of arrogant elders and youths on the chariot, giving off an air of superiority.

"Divine Clan!" Nan Gong Yuying's eyes flashed with killing intent, golden light radiating from his body, filling the entire ship.

"Divine Clan! No wonder they're so arrogant; they dare to use beasts for transport in the Demon Domain!" Others from different domains also sighed, gazing at the massive chariot.

But this was the Demon Domain; each figure's eyes were fierce, filled with hatred toward the chariot. However, they dared not act recklessly since it was the Divine Clan. If they did, these beasts might immediately rush to attack. All beasts glared fiercely; if the Holy City issued a command, they would fight even if they knew they couldn't win.

"Move aside!" A deep voice echoed in Luotian's ears, sounding like a god looking down on them.

Luotian's ship was blocking the Divine Clan's chariot, so he knew this voice was directed at them.

Instantly, Zheng Xin and others glared back with icy eyes, standing up slowly as waves of power radiated from them.

Luotian observed coldly without controlling the ship to move, continuing forward toward the Holy City.

"I told you to move aside; didn't you hear?" A cold voice and pressure instantly pressed upon Luotian's ship.

"Luotian, don't be reckless; first move aside. The Divine Clan is someone we can't afford to offend!" Du Hongtao's face was dark, transmitting a mental message to Luotian. He knew Luotian's hot temper and was worried, urging him immediately.

Luotian's face darkened; since the ship had Du Hongtao and Lu Han, he nodded slightly, shifting the ship a bit.

"Good that you're sensible!" A cold snort came from the chariot, carrying a hint of satisfaction.

"Roar..." The earth dragons roared, their massive eyes filled with fear, even trembling slightly as they gazed at the Holy City but continued toward it.

"Spit! Truly embarrassing beasts; a good earth dragon used for transport, truly deserving of death!" The Demon Domain's beasts spoke without hesitation, their eyes filled with disdain as they watched the two Supreme Rank earth dragons. They didn't hide their words, which reached the dragons' ears.

The two earth dragons were of Supreme Rank and could already transform into human forms, so they understood the beasts' words. Their massive eyes showed shame.

"Hmph... just animals, I'll catch them all and make them my steeds once I reach the Holy Rank!" A young disciple on the chariot, glowing with golden light and at half-step Holy Rank, spoke arrogantly.

"Silence!" A senior on the chariot heard the youth's words and his face slightly changed, immediately scolding him.

"Roar..." This sentence ignited the beasts' fury; their eyes turned blood-red, rushing toward the chariot.

Since the existence of the Demon Domain, no one had ever dared to speak so arrogantly or insult the beasts within it.

The youth's words ignited a fuse, instantly causing the beasts to erupt in fury. They rushed toward the chariot without fear of death, surrounding it.

"Roar..." A chorus of thunderous roars echoed as beasts from various races revealed their true forms, charging toward the chariot's barrier.

Though these beasts had at most Transcendent Realm cultivation, others were of Supreme Rank or even Boundary Lord Rank. However, after revealing their true forms, their massive bodies and fierce auras were震撼ing.

"Hmph... just a group of riffraff; what's so special? They can't even break our chariot's barrier!" The half-step Holy Rank youth spoke dismissively.

"Smack..." Before the youth finished speaking, a senior on the chariot slapped him away: "You damned fool, shut up!"

Everyone on the chariot bore怨恨 expressions, gazing at the youth with looks of disdain.

Luotian and others stood nearby, watching this shocking scene, their faces filled with admiration. They hadn't expected the beasts of the Demon Domain to be so strong, rushing to fight the Divine Clan merely for being insulted.

"Deserved! They truly deserve death!" Zheng Xin and others stood on the ancient warship, cursing loudly. These people were close to Nan Gong Yuying and knew his relationship with the Divine Clan, naturally standing on his side. They hated the Divine Clan deeply.

The sound of thunder echoed constantly as massive beasts collided with the chariot's barrier, their momentum impressive but no beast dying immediately. However, blood continuously stained the barrier, dyeing the chariot's surroundings red.

The Divine Clan was always proud; even in the Demon Domain, their attitude hadn't changed. The youth who had spoken harshly was slapped away, but now the situation had reached this point, causing the Divine Clan's people to be furious. They were of at least Transcendent Realm cultivation, with even a Holy Rank Mid-Stage elder present. Being attacked by these low-level beasts immediately ignited their killing intent.

"Die!" Each Divine Clan youth's eyes flashed with cold light, standing at the chariot's front. Their bodies glowed with power as they unleashed powerful martial arts from their hands.

"This is the Demon Domain's Holy City, not your Divine Clan's place to run wild! Do you think we have no one here?" A cold aura rose from the Holy City, several powerful auras emerging instantly, sending an overwhelming pressure.

Roars echoed as massive beasts bowed their heads respectfully toward the Holy City, eyes filled with fervor.

"Buzz..." A green hand emerged from the crystalline planet, covering the sky and appearing like a green meteor. It instantly struck the chariot and the two earth dragons.

"Being an earth dragon, having a bit of dragon blood, yet serving humans—what face do you have to live?" A cold voice echoed from the Holy City, carrying an overwhelming aura of superiority that resonated in everyone's minds.

"Boom..." The green hand struck heavily, and the sky instantly filled with two clouds of blood. The two earth dragons were annihilated by this green hand.

"Playing around also has limits; you dare to act recklessly elsewhere, but in the Demon Domain, even if you're a dragon, you must coil; even if you're a tiger, you must lie down. I'll destroy two Divine Clan Holy Sons as punishment!" Another cold voice echoed, and a green phoenix slowly emerged from the planet's mountains. Roaring, it bathed in endless divine light, instantly sweeping up the two Divine Clan Holy Sons and swallowing them.

"A Holy Rank Late-Stage phoenix clan! I never thought I'd witness the legendary race today!" Luotian's face bore admiration as he gazed at the phoenix, now transformed into an old man holding a feather fan.

The old man had white hair and wore green robes, his appearance seemingly around the same age as Du Hongtao and Lu Han. However, Luotian could sense this old man was much older than them.

"Respect the Phoenix Clan's Elder!" The beasts bowed respectfully, their voices resounding loudly in the starry sky.

Chapter 925: Elite from All Domains

Outside the Demon Domain's Holy City, under the starry sky, a green phoenix slowly coalesced, bathed in endless radiant light. It eventually transformed into an old man with white hair and green robes.

Numerous massive, fierce beasts gazed at the old man with boundless fervor, kneeling in the starry sky to show respect.

"Respected elder of the Demon Domain, our Divine Clan has no intention of opposing the Demon Domain. I beg you to release my two Holy Sons, as this was our mistake. Please show mercy!" A mid-stage Holy Rank elder of the Divine Clan bowed respectfully to the Phoenix Clan's old man.

"Hmph, this once; if there is a next time, even if your Divine Clan brings the entire clan, we will ensure you have no return. You think yourselves descendants of gods but are useless races that can't even swallow a demon clan. Come to the Demon Domain and dare to be so arrogant!" The old man waved his hand, and two pale-faced Divine Clan Holy Sons appeared before everyone's eyes.

"Indeed! People say the Divine Clan is proud, but they don't know that within the Demon Domain's Holy City, the Eight Holy Clans are each more proud than the next. The Phoenix Clan, ranked second, is also extremely arrogant, even more so than the Divine Clan." Others from different domains murmured, their faces filled with admiration as they gazed at the late-stage Holy Rank old man high above.

"Yes, it was my oversight!" The mid-stage Divine Clan elder bowed respectfully, his eyes flashing with anger briefly before grabbing the two dejected Holy Sons.

"Good luck! Remember, this is the Demon Domain; it's our beast clan's world!" The old man spoke and then vanished into a faint shadow, disappearing from sight.

"Indeed, it's no wonder the Fire Domain is ranked third; just entering, I've already seen a late-stage Holy Rank powerhouse!" Luotian furrowed his brows slightly, sensing this journey into the Demon Domain might be far more difficult than he had imagined.

"Second Elder, what should we do?" The Divine Clan's people looked fearful, gazing at their elder.

"Enter the Holy City; wait for the Grand Elder to arrive. He is also a late-stage Holy Rank powerhouse, and we'll decide after that!" The Divine Clan elder spoke, his voice filled with impatience. He hadn't expected such an incident upon arriving in the Demon Domain.

"What a fool! I don’t know how your IQ got you to be a Holy Son!" The Divine Clan elder waved his hand, crushing the youth who had spoken wrongly. He didn’t even let out a scream before dying in his hand.

"Boom..." As people marveled at the Divine Clan elder's cruelty, killing even his own Holy Son without hesitation, a thunderous sound echoed.

A powerful golden light drew everyone's attention, and regardless of humans or beasts, they all opened their mouths in shock.

A green lightning bolt sliced through the sky like a bridge of thunder, an awe-inspiring sight.

"This is the Thunder Domain's Lightning Bridge! I never thought the Thunder Domain would send their Grandmaster personally!" People marveled, gazing at the lightning bridge in the starry sky and the people descending from it.

"Such a grand display, don't you fear breaking your back!" The Divine Clan's people looked coldly on, naturally looking down on the Thunder Domain. Their entrance was even more arrogant than theirs!

Hearing the Divine Clan's scolding, people smiled slightly, secretly sighing. It wasn’t that the Divine Clan’s entrance was wrong; it was just the way they entered was inappropriate. In the Demon Domain, using beasts as transport, if these people weren’t from the Divine Clan, they would have already been killed by a Demon Domain powerhouse.

"Thunder Domain! Today really is an ill-fated meeting!" Nan Gong Yuying smiled, but his smile held endless coldness as he glanced at Li Tianzhi by his side.

"Thunder Domain! It's truly a place I remember!" Li Tianzhi’s eyes flashed with lightning, transforming into sparks that burned with endless fury in his eyes.

Luotian saw their situation and knew Li Tianzhi likely had a grudge with the Thunder Domain.

Not long after the Thunder Domain's group arrived, black mist spread, darkening the starry sky as if it were the end of days. A massive ancient warship, ten times larger than Luotian’s, sliced through the darkness and appeared in sight.

"Demons!" Nan Gong Yuying clenched his fist, gazing at the warship approaching the Divine Clan with a cold expression.

"What in the world, why do all of you have grudges!" Gulei and Zheng Xin looked at the three forces that had arrived, each one seemingly having a grudge with them.

The Divine Clan and Demon Clan naturally needed no explanation; Nan Gong Yuying alone had a deep grudge, not to mention Wanlingkong, who had been hunted by both clans.

What puzzled people was why the Thunder Domain had a grudge with Li Tianzhi, causing him to hate them so much. Their eyes turned toward Li Tianzhi.

"Enough, Tianzhi's situation is basically the same as mine. He was even more tragic; I had an elder to guide me out, but Tianzhi survived purely by luck!" Nan Gong Yuying's face bore a nostalgic expression, recalling the scene when he first met Li Tianzhi.

At that time, Li Tianzhi had been thrown into the first death trap of the Thunder Domain—Thunder Sea Marsh—when he was still a child. As the first death trap of the Thunder Domain, it was impossible for an infant to survive. However, Li Tianzhi had incredible luck and was saved by the Thunder Sea Spirit, the Thunderbird, eventually surviving to become who he was today.

"Although I don’t know why they wanted to kill me, the entire Thunder Domain is my enemy!" Li Tianzhi's face bore a fierce expression as he gazed at the Thunder Domain’s people.

"Adding our two domains and the Demon Domain, five of the Nine Domains have arrived. I wonder if the Mortal Domain has anyone here and that mysterious Chaos Domain, as well as the Revenant and Starry Domains. I suppose it's because they're far away that they haven't arrived yet!" Luotian sighed, gazing at the three powerful forces outside the Holy City without entering it.

Luotian knew now wasn’t the time to be loud; his current strength was clearly at a disadvantage against any of the three forces.

Others also noticed the situation, standing behind Luotian and waiting for developments.

People were quite interested in the three forces; such a gathering of powerful factions was rare.

"Fourth Holy Star Domain, Luotian has arrived!" A loud voice echoed through the starry sky. The Divine Clan's mid-stage Holy Rank elder had a cold expression, scanning around for Luotian’s image on the Divine Clan's painting.

"Fourth Holy Star Domain? That weak domain also came to the Demon Domain?" People heard this and began discussing, some even unfamiliar with the domain.

As the elder scanned around, Wanlingkong's face changed. Three array flags flew out; one landed on Luotian, another on Nan Gong Yuying, and the third on Wanlingkong himself.

When the array flags fell, outsiders saw Luotian's three people’s appearances changed; their cultivation was merely Transcendent Realm.

The three had all been hunted by the Divine Clan and Demon Clan, so their appearances and auras were well-known to both. Wanlingkong had no choice but to be cautious.

"Amazing!" Du Hongtao and Lu Han looked at Wanlingkong with shock, never expecting his array mastery to have reached such a level.

Hearing no response, the Divine Clan's mid-stage Holy Rank elder smiled slightly and said nothing. The Demon Clan’s mid-stage elder also softened his expression.

"Old dog, once I enter the Ancient Heaven Palace, I'll take care of your two Holy Sons and elders. I'll ensure your clan's lineage ends in this generation!" Luotian clenched his fists, his body radiating killing intent.

"Hmph! A weak Fourth Holy Star Domain dares to challenge the Divine Clan's authority; you're seeking death! Luotian, if you are here, don’t be a coward. Come out and I'll cut you down!" A Divine Clan Holy Son spoke with disdain, shouting loudly.

"Nan Gong Yuying, Luotian, you should hide! Once we come out of the Heaven Palace, it'll be the Fourth Holy Star Domain's end!" The Demon Clan’s Holy Son also shouted loudly, his voice echoing through the stars, sending shivers.

Luotian and others all lowered their heads, clenching their fists so tightly they made a creaking sound. Their eyes gazed at the ground, their killing intent reaching its peak.

"Hmm? Fire Domain also has people here?" The Divine Clan's mid-stage Holy Rank elder hadn’t found Luotian and Nan Gong Yuying but noticed Du Hongtao and Lu Han in the crowd.

"Fire Domain, the second-to-last domain, also has people here? Is that Du Hongtao of Fire Domain's Mountain Sea Sect or Lu Han of the Flame Sect?" People’s eyes eventually turned to Luotian's group, but they looked at Du Hongtao and Lu Han instead.

"Even the sect masters are only Holy Rank Early Stage; Fire Domain is truly weak! Ha, there's even a Nine Source Boundary Lord. However, those young people are quite good; some have reached half-step Holy Rank, probably sect heirs. Reaching half-step Holy Rank is already a prodigy!" People discussed, their eyes filled with disdain as they gazed at Luotian's group.

"Du Hongtao, are you also entering the Ancient Heaven Palace? You know it's a place of nine deaths and no returns. If you fall there, it would be a big loss for your two sects! After all, Holy Rank is hard to cultivate!" The one who had vowed to cut Luotian down, Sun Feiwen, didn’t care about being a junior and spoke to Du Hongtao and Lu Han with golden light, calling them by name.

"Hmph... your Tianyu brother is much stronger than you!" As Du Hongtao and Lu Han's faces darkened, the little girl Du Yuying raised her fists defiantly at Sun Feiwen.

Chapter 926: Patience

Under the starry sky of the Demon Domain, a little girl, lively and spirited, stood at the front of Luotian's group. Her face bore an expression of defiance as she spoke to the golden-clad, powerful Divine Clan elders.

Du Yuying's words fell, and the atmosphere of the starry sky momentarily stilled. Then, the Divine Clan's people laughed without restraint. Sun Feiwen at the front of the group saw Du Yuying and his eyes lit up.

Du Yuying looked like a blooming flower, her lively eyes making people unable to be angry despite her words offending the proud Divine Clan.

"Ha ha, are you Du Hongtao's daughter or disciple? A lively little girl!" Sun Feiwen smiled, stepping forward a few steps as if he were a miniature sun, approaching Du Yuying.

Although Sun Feiwen was at half-step Holy Rank, his qi was impossibly strong. His powerful aura made Du Yuying shrink back and hide behind Du Hongtao.

Du Hongtao's face darkened, blocking Du Yuying and smiling at Sun Feiwen: "My daughter is spoiled; her words were impolite. I hope the Divine Clan's Holy Son doesn't mind."

"Where, where? No need to be polite. Call me Feiwen! I'm instantly smitten with her; please grant me a small favor and let me speak with her alone!" Sun Feiwen smiled, his golden eyes radiating light as he gazed at Du Yuying, as if wanting to devour her.

Du Yuying shrank back, although Sun Feiwen's words were gentle, they were undeniable.

"Ghahaha, Sun Feiwen's old habit has returned! But it's fine; a weak Fire Domain isn't worth much. This little girl looks pure, but I wonder if she'll survive once she enters Sun Feiwen's harem!" The Divine Clan people smiled, discussing among themselves.

Luotian and others furrowed their brows slightly. They had planned not to clash with the Divine Clan, but now they seemed to be provoking them.

Du Yuying was Du Hongtao's life, and Luotian knew this well. Thus, he wouldn’t allow Sun Feiwen’s impolite request.

Indeed, Du Hongtao's face darkened; his old body trembled slightly but finally restrained himself and forced a smile: "Apologies, my daughter has never been apart from me. I can't fulfill your request!"

"Ha ha, good! You're the first to refuse me, Sun Feiwen. In the Divine and Demon Domains, even a Holy Rank Early Stage person wouldn't dare to defy me. I never thought in the Demon Domain, a sect master from Fire Domain would dare to defy me!" Sun Feiwen smiled but his voice was devoid of emotion, his eyes staring at Du Hongtao and the group, including Luotian.

"Today, if I really want your daughter?" The next moment, Sun Feiwen's face turned icy, his change of expression was instantaneous.

"Let them surround these trash!" Sun Feiwen's face bore coldness as he ordered his Divine Clan people.

"Buzz..." As Sun Feiwen's words fell, the Divine Clan people instantly surrounded Luotian's group, blocking all escape routes and sealing the space tightly.

Seeing the Divine Clan people’s actions, Nan Gong Yuying and others were no pushovers. Their auras surged into the sky, their eyes cold. Though they were only Transcendent Realm and half-step Holy Rank, they showed no signs of retreating.

"Roar? Fire Domain people really have grown! You dare to oppose us, the Divine Clan!" A half-step Holy Rank Divine Clan son spoke with disdain, laughing.

The Divine Clan people all had cold faces, gazing at Luotian's group. They had previously been rebuked by the late-stage Holy Rank phoenix clan in the Holy City, which left them angry. Now a weak Fire Domain dared to challenge their authority, clearly pushing them to the limit.
