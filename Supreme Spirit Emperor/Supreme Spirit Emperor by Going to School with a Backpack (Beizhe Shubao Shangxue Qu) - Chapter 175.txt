Since their Original Sources were suppressed, they could not sense Luo Tian’s cultivation level. To them, this young man was at most a Seven-source Heaven's Supreme—already an astonishing talent.

“Boy, do you think you can subdue us?” Three Seven-source Heaven's Supremes sneered as they addressed Luo Tian.

Chen He Guang’s face also bore an expression of disbelief. He had not expected Luo Tian to aim at subduing these people, and his gaze toward Luo Tian shifted.

“Everyone present—if anyone wishes to follow me, I can assure you that from today forward, you will escape this eternal prison and reclaim your lives. Of course, the price is your loyalty—your sworn oath of allegiance!” Luo Tian’s voice was calm yet resonated like a thunderclap across the prison.

The crowd erupted in chaos. Some faces showed hesitation, others sneered. The commonality was a brief uproar followed by silence, all eyes turning to Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming. These three held such prestige in the prison that no one dared accept Luo Tian’s terms without their approval.

Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming wore expressions of disdain. Previously, the Four Great Sects had attempted to court them, but failed. Seven-source Heaven's Supremes were rare across the Four Sacred Star Domains; each was invaluable, hence the sects’ intense focus.

Jin Jinglong’s face brimmed with killing intent as he glared at Luo Tian: “Boy, I sense the aura of countless souls from the Vermilion Phoenix Sect on you. Did you slaughter all those stationed at Tiger Prison Star?”

“Correct!” Luo Tian nodded without hesitation, inwardly sighing. Indeed, a ruthless man who had bloodied several continents could discern the aura of those he’d slain.

“Hmph. To make me submit, unseal my power and fight me fairly!” Jin Jinglong’s face bore a glint of murder.

Though Jin Jinglong had once killed indiscriminately, he now appeared normal. He knew he was a Vermilion Phoenix Sect disciple and that Kong Xinghe had treated him kindly. Luo Tian’s slaying of so many from the Vermilion Phoenix Sect made him a mortal enemy, and Jin Jinglong should aid his sect.

Luo Tian discerned Jin Jinglong’s thoughts; all present knew it, their faces betraying amusement.

“Impossible! Lord Chancellor, if you unseal Jin Jinglong, he might escape and bring calamity to countless continents!” Chen He Guang cried out, his voice laced with urgency.

Luo Tian ignored Jin Jinglong and Chen He Guang’s obstruction, his gaze flicking between Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming.

“Strength is the only way,” Luo Tian murmured, sensing their disdain.

“What’s the best way to demonstrate strength? Killing!” Luo Tian’s gaze narrowed, settling on Jin Jinglong.

This situation was ideal for establishing authority—Jin Jinglong’s crimes were severe, and as a Vermilion Phoenix Sect disciple, Luo Tian had no reason to spare him.

“Agreed,” Luo Tian nodded slightly, addressing Jin Jinglong with a flat tone.

A collective gasp echoed through the crowd as Luo Tian’s words fell, eyes fixating on him like he were a monster. None expected Luo Tian to accept Jin Jinglong’s challenge.

“Blimey, is this kid suicidal? That’s Jin Jinglong! Unsealing his power would bring disaster!” The crowd murmured, fear etched on their faces.

Even Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming stiffened, surprised by Luo Tian’s casual acceptance.

“Hah! Good lad, I like your spirit. If you defeat Jin Jinglong, I’ll follow you!” Tu Hongfei laughed heartily, his gaze approving but secretly doubting Luo Tian’s chances.

In the prison for so long, Tu Hongfei knew Jin Jinglong’s strength—his opponent was a rabid dog, ruthless and terrifying.

Ma Yingjie’s face remained impassive; his gaze narrowed at Luo Tian, the weakest among them but most calculating. He was cautious and deliberate.

“Hah! Boss, if you defeat him, don’t forget to take me out!” Jin Jinglong’s subordinates grinned, equally skeptical of Luo Tian. If Jin Jinglong won, no one in the prison would challenge him.

“Begin!” Jin Jinglong’s face twisted into a sinister grin, his finger beckoning Luo Tian.

“Ah…” Chen He Guang wanted to stop him but knew, after these two days’ interactions, Luo Tian was no arrogant youth. Based on his strength yesterday, he could defeat Jin Jinglong.

Yet Chen He Guang still worried—though Jin Jinglong might be defeated, he retained escape capabilities. This man was a killing machine; if he escaped, countless lives would be lost.

Luo Tian’s elders scoffed, believing Luo Tian could annihilate Jin Jinglong in an instant.

As they mused, Luo Tian’s fingers formed a seal, and a sigil of Original Source energy shot from his hand into Jin Jinglong’s body.

“Boom…” As the sigil entered Jin Jinglong, his face lit up with joy, and his body emitted a thunderous roar. Crimson energy enveloped him, obscuring his form from view.

The crowd dispersed, leaving space for Luo Tian and Jin Jinglong. Blood-red mist swirled, thunderous echoes resounded, and crimson lightning crackled within the blood-energy. A chilling aura spread outward, making onlookers tremble involuntarily.

“Who has this Jin Jinglong killed?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, gazing at the endless blood-energy. He recalled only two who matched Jin Jinglong’s aura: the imperial-robed man from the Age Book and Nan Gong Yuqing. All three had reached a state of soul-bound torment.

“Roar…” Wraiths of gray energy surged from the blood-energy, attacking Jin Jinglong with boundless resentment.

“Familiar scent, familiar aura, and formidable strength!” Jin Jinglong laughed, the blood-energy flooding his body. The countless souls were absorbed into him, restoring his strength to Seven-source Heaven’s Supreme.

“Indeed stronger than ordinary Seven-sources, but this is still insufficient!” Luo Tian’s expression remained calm as eight Dao Sources roared within him, forming eight long dragons circling his body. He didn’t even draw his Rending Sky Spear; he knew a Seven-source Heaven’s Supreme could be felled by his fists alone.

“Eight… Eight-sources…” Tu Hongfei’s voice trembled as he beheld the eight Dao Sources before Luo Tian, his eyes wide with shock.

The crowd was stunned; even the most obtuse could now recognize Luo Tian as an Eight-source.

“My heavens! So young, yet already Eight-source!” Ma Yingming’s eyes gleamed with sharpness before darkening—no one knew what he pondered.

Beneath Tiger Prison Star, in a dark realm, a black barrier pushed aside the earth, revealing an emaciated black-cloaked elder seated on a broken bed. At the moment Luo Tian unleashed his Eight-source power, the old man slowly opened his eyes.

A young man cloaked in blood-energy stood respectfully at the elder’s door. Upon the old man’s awakening, the youth stepped forward: “Respected Elder, what is it?”

“The young man above—good. Perhaps he can aid you!” The old man’s voice was aged and deep.

“Hmph?” Nan Gong Yuqing heard the elder’s words, his body trembling. His terrifying spiritual sense surged outward, discovering Luo Tian above.

“Is it him?” Nan Gong Yuqing’s eyes flickered with surprise, then a smile.

“Make contact with him; bring him to me later!” The elder spoke, then closed his eyes again as if in meditation, his presence vanishing like a corpse.

“Indeed fated,” Nan Gong Yuqing mused, stepping out of the dark space.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian stood on the ground; at the old man’s awakening, he felt an inexplicable shiver. It was as if invisible eyes scanned him, his hair standing on end.

“Who…? Not Nan Gong Yuqing! His aura is familiar, but this power surpasses even Nine-sources. Could it be the premonition I felt before entering Tiger Prison Star?” Luo Tian’s mind quaked.

At that moment, Jin Jinglong paused, sensing Luo Tian’s might. His body transformed into a crimson dragon, roaring and lunging at Luo Tian.

Chapter 818: Reencountering Nan Gong Yuqing

Luo Tian was still stunned when Jin Jinglong’s attack reached him. The cold aura snapped him back to focus.

“Boom…” Jin Jinglong’s crimson dragon bore a triumphant grin, having unleashed his full strength. He was confident he could wound an Eight-source.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened, sensing the immense fluctuations on Jin Jinglong’s fist. He couldn’t summon his Original Source in time; instead, he clenched his fist and launched a Killing God’s Fist directly at Jin Jinglong.

The collision erupted, blood-energy churned, and the clash of their powers sent shockwaves outward. The stone tiles beneath them were torn apart.

A crimson and a black streak flashed through the crowd, leaving them awestruck.

Jin Jinglong spat black blood, his face etched with shock—shock at Luo Tian’s speed and strength. His fist had been fully committed, yet Luo Tian remained unscathed. This realization made Jin Jinglong decide to flee.

“Flee!” He transformed into a red streak, tearing through the sky at breakneck speed toward Tiger Prison’s exit.

“Lord Luo, stop him!” Chen He Guang cried out, fear in his voice as Jin Jinglong escaped.

“Alas… he’s too green. We Seven-sources can escape even from an Eight-source. Now, this Jin Jinglong’s escape will bring disaster to several continents!” Tu Hongfei smiled, speaking softly.

“Flee? With our master here, he dares to flee? Not even a Nine-source could escape from our master’s grasp!” The dozens of elders, aware of Luo Tian’s might, scoffed and rebuked.

Before their words faded, Jin Jinglong’s form appeared at the prison gate. His pale face bore a grin; the two Two-source Heaven’s Supremes of the Xuanwu Sect were but ants to him. Once past the gate, he’d be free.

“Showed off and now wants to leave?” Luo Tian stood in the sky, eyes cold as he gazed at Jin Jinglong’s fleeing form.

Lightning crackled beneath his feet, Original Source energy coalescing as he vanished from sight. With a single white finger, he pointed—time itself halted in the prison, the Time Source at play.

In an instant, Jin Jinglong’s body froze, his eyes widening as he beheld the prison gate mere steps away. He could even hear the two Xuanwu Sect disciples’ heartbeats and their terror-filled gazes.

“Did I say you could leave?” Luo Tian’s form materialized before Jin Jinglong, his foot lashing out to kick Jin Jinglong’s face.

“Boom…” Jin Jinglong’s speed remained undiminished, but he was sent flying back, crashing into the ground and shaking the prison.

“Cough… cough…” Jin Jinglong felt his internal organs displaced, his vision darkening.

“He’s too strong; I’m no match for him. Must I become that merciless monster again?” Jin Jinglong slowly rose.

“I submit!” His eyes held complex emotions before he resolvedly spoke the three words.

“No,” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in Jin Jinglong’s ears, causing his face to contort.

Luo Tian loomed over him, his foot again crushing Jin Jinglong’s pale face into the ground.

Luo Tian didn’t want to take Jin Jinglong—Seven-source Heaven’s Supreme was invaluable, especially for the newly founded Tianyuan Sect. But he couldn’t accept Jin Jinglong: first, his methods required killing others to complete; second, he was a Vermilion Phoenix Sect disciple—accepting him would bring trouble. Third, Luo Tian needed to establish authority; he favored Ma Yingming and Tu Hongfei over Jin Jinglong.

“Damn you, Luo Tian! This is your doing!” Jin Jinglong rose, his face twisted with hatred. His voice was deliberate.

“What’s your choice?” Luo Tian sneered, seeing Jin Jinglong as a pitiful opponent.

“Good! Today I’ll fight you to the death!” Jin Jinglong’s face bore boundless hatred, his voice echoing.

“Fighting me? That’s your choice!” Luo Tian’s gaze was dismissive, but he waited for Jin Jinglong to complete his Blood Soul Transformation.

“Luo Tian, you’re overconfident!” Tu Hongfei’s face paled, watching Jin Jinglong’s power surge.

“Perhaps,” Ma Yingming’s expression was expectant, his eyes on Luo Tian standing proudly.

Outside the crowd, Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, his blood-energy receding into normalcy. He spoke softly: “Last time you were injured; now I’ll see what talent you have to warrant the Elder’s attention. You must be useful to me!”

Those behind Nan Gong Yuqing, hearing his mutterings, felt their minds quake. While others didn’t know the Elder’s identity, those who had followed Nan Gong Yuqing for years knew—this was a terrifying figure. To be valued by such a being, Luo Tian’s strength and talent must be extraordinary.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Jin Jinglong’s body radiated blood-energy again, his eyes turning crimson. His throat gurgled as he roared.

The blood of seven thousand souls from the Vermilion Phoenix and Xuanwu Sects, still fresh, rose with Jin Jinglong’s roar. They flowed as red streaks through the prison gate toward his body.

The seven thousand souls’ blood-energy were instantly devoured, Jin Jinglong’s injuries healing as he returned to peak condition.

“Eight-source! Using boundless blood-energy to forge a Source!” The crowd gasped, eyes wide at Jin Jinglong’s newfound strength.

Luo Tian’s eyes flickered—Jin Jinglong had entered the Eight-source realm, not like Xuanwu’s method without a Source but genuinely ascending.

“How did he obtain such a technique?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his body moving toward Jin Jinglong with the Rending Sky Spear in hand.

“Roar…” At Luo Tian’s movement, Jin Jinglong sensed his formidable aura and licked his lips, eyes glowing with bloodlust. He forgot his previous fear of Luo Tian’s might, becoming a mindless beast charging at him.

Luo Tian thrust his spear forward, the sky ablaze with golden light, a tremor shaking the world. He struck Jin Jinglong.

Jin Jinglong grabbed his fist,凝聚 eight Sources into it and launched a punch. The clash echoed again, but this time Luo Tian didn’t retreat—he stood in the sky, his brow furrowed.

Unluckily, Jin Jinglong stopped before those who had followed him.

“Lord, are you alright?” A Two-source Heaven’s Supreme asked, sensing Jin Jinglong’s odd state.

“Boom… boom…” But Jin Jinglong ignored the Two-source, his palm striking out and crushing a group of prisoners. Blood splattered into view.

Jin Jinglong inhaled, absorbing the blood-energy back into his body. His injury from Luo Tian’s spear healed instantly, and he roared again, fearless as he charged at Luo Tian.

“Mad! This Jin Jinglong has truly lost his mind. If we don’t stop him, we’ll all die! Luo Tian, unseal our bindings and fight together to kill Jin Jinglong!” Tu Hongfei’s face was anxious, his gaze desperate.

“No need. A mere Eight-source without reason!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out, his confidence unshaken—no one could defeat an Eight-source.

His hands moved swiftly, gathering light-energy from his body. A碧green flame also emerged, merging with his Light Source.

“Great Sun灭魔印!” Luo Tian chanted, and a sun-like seal formed in his hand, rising into the sky.

Chapter 819: Can You Defeat Him?

In Tiger Prison, the sun-like seal ascended, illuminating the prison with its brilliance. The crowd gazed in awe as it reached the sky, purifying the gloom and radiating intense heat.

Luo Tian had been busy these days, searching through the memories of the Green Dragon Sect’s former Grand Master to find suitable techniques. He knew his skills were good but still lagged behind figures like Sha Cangmang. His foundation was too shallow.

This Great Sun灭魔印 was one of the techniques he discovered—light-energy purification combined with the terrifying temperature of碧晶琉璃火, making it a perfect counter to all evil.

As the seal rose, Jin Jinglong’s fierce expression turned agonizing—this seal was a deadly weapon against evil cultivators like him.

“Terrifying! I can’t imagine what creatures could survive under this seal!” Tu Hongfei’s face bore fear, his gaze on the sun-like seal. He knew under it, he’d be annihilated without a trace.

“Roar…” Jin Jinglong, though mindless, retained instinct. He sensed if he continued, he’d die and roared, transforming into a sea of blood, raining crimson droplets from the sky.

“Blood Sea Overwhelming Heaven!” Jin Jinglong’s low roar echoed, sounding like a beast in its death throes.

The blood-sea churned, surging toward the sun-like seal to counter it with its power.

“Just you?” Luo Tian sneered, his fingers sealing as he pressed down on Jin Jinglong.

“Sizzle…” The blood-sea, though terrifying, was instantly melted by the seal’s purification and heat.

“Ah…” But it wasn’t over—intense temperature and purification swept over Jin Jinglong.

Jin Jinglong screamed, instantly turning to ash before their eyes—this Eight-source Heaven’s Supreme was annihilated.

“Dead… dead…” Tu Hongfei’s lips trembled, staring at Luo Tian’s calm face.

The entire prison fell silent; prisoners gaped in disbelief, stunned by Luo Tian’s might—how could an Eight-source be killed so swiftly?

Thinking of the seal, their hearts clenched. Nothing could survive under it.

“Hmph…” Chen He Guang sighed, awed by Luo Tian’s strength and relieved Jin Jinglong hadn’t escaped.

“Your choice?” Luo Tian turned to Ma Yingming and Tu Hongfei, awaiting their decision. If they submitted, the prison would be fully under his control.

“Good! I said if you defeated Jin Jinglong, I’d submit to you. I Tu Hongfei keep my word. But I won’t swear a Blood Oath—I’d rather not follow orders that would lead to my death.” Tu Hongfei spoke boldly, bowing to Luo Tian.

“Hail Lord!” As Tu Hongfei bowed, his followers smiled, shouting to Luo Tian. Some voices trembled with excitement—knowing they’d reclaim normal lives by pledging to Luo Tian.

“Hah! Good, everyone rise! Since you’ve followed me, I won’t betray you. Trust me!” Seeing Tu Hongfei’s submission, Luo Tian felt relieved and turned to Ma Yingming.

Understanding Luo Tian’s intent, Ma Yingming—intelligent as he was—knew he awaited his answer.

In truth, Ma Yingming wanted to accept Luo Tian’s offer. His strength was undeniable, and his youth made him promising. Seeing the dozens of elders behind Luo Tian treating him kindly, it was clear he valued his people. Escaping this prison by following Luo Tian was the best choice.

Yet Ma Yingming wasn’t blinded by immediate gains. Surviving in this prison required more than strength—it needed wit.

“Old Ma, submit too! This Luo Tian is worth following!” Tu Hongfei urged, seeing Ma Yingming hesitate.

Seeing Tu Hongfei’s sincere gaze, Ma Yingming smiled bitterly. Though they had some rivalry, it was only for show to pass the time in prison. In reality, their years together had made them friends. Tu Hongfei’s encouragement stirred Ma Yingming slightly.

But then, Ma Yingming noticed the figure outside—Nan Gong Yuqing, appearing as an ordinary man. His body trembled slightly.

Noticing Ma Yingming’s change, Luo Tian also spotted Nan Gong Yuqing, his face shifting.

At the same time, the crowd noticed Nan Gong Yuqing’s presence, gasping in unison.

“Nan Gong Yuqing!” Chen He Guang slapped his head, feeling a headache—his worst fear had come true.

“You’ll follow me if you defeat him!” Ma Yingming smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Boom…” As Ma Yingming’s words fell, the crowd erupted in chaos, eyes turning to his smiling face.

“This…” Tu Hongfei also saw Nan Gong Yuqing, standing still, inwardly sighing he’d forgotten this troublemaker.

Though Nan Gong Yuqing was low-key, it didn’t mean he lacked status in the prison. Tu Hongfei remembered three years ago when a Seven-source Heaven’s Supreme of similar strength provoked him, only to be killed and hung at the prison gate for seven days, burned by black flames.

“Long time no see!” Luo Tian pushed through the crowd, smiling as he approached Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Indeed long time no see. Remember what I said before? If my mood is bad, I’ll kill you! I didn’t expect to meet here—this coincidence isn’t good for me!” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, as if greeting a neighbor, but his words carried an icy distance.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed—what was this strange Nan Gong Yuqing up to?

“Buzz…” A blood-red sword flew from Nan Gong Yuqing’s back, landing in his hand.

At the same time, endless blood-energy radiated from him, turning the world red. Crimson droplets fell onto people’s bodies.

“I won’t fight you. You once saved my life!” Luo Tian shook his head, sensing the blood-energy had intensified several times. He sighed inwardly—fighting Nan Gong Yuqing would be a 50-50 chance. If they fought to the end, both would perish.

“They know each other!” Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming’s faces shifted, eyes on Luo Tian. They hadn’t expected him to know Nan Gong Yuqing beforehand, and from his words, it was clear Nan Gong Yuqing had once saved Luo Tian’s life.

“Two monsters!” The crowd gazed at the two young faces, murmuring—so young yet already Eight-source. Their futures were boundless.

“Fight then! If you don’t defeat me, Ma Yingming won’t submit to you!”

“I’ll gamble too. If you win, not only will Ma Yingming submit, but I will too!” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, stroking his blood-red sword. The blade emitted low murmurs, as if countless souls were crying.

“Really fight?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows—he didn’t want to fight Nan Gong Yuqing, but the conditions were tempting.

An Eight-source Heaven’s Supreme—comparable to a Nine-source—was rare across the Four Sacred Star Domains. If they allied, Luo Tian was certain no sect would match them.

“Really fight!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s brow furrowed, his aura surging, pushing back the crowd. Only he and Luo Tian remained.

“Fine!” Luo Tian stopped talking, drawing his Rending Sky Spear. His green energy surrounded him as he spoke: “You once saved my life, so I’ll let you strike three times!”

Hearing this, Nan Gong Yuqing’s brow lifted. For years, no one had dared say such a thing to him—not even his domain’s prodigies.

Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates’ faces also shifted, their gazes turning to disdain: “That kid, are you suicidal? You don’t know our master’s methods!”

“Never mind. I was in a good mood; if you let me strike three times, I fear you’d have no chance to fight further. That would be pointless!” Nan Gong Yuqing, clearly proud, his Original Sources gathered into the blood-red sword. He slashed it across space toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 820: Demise of the Demon
In Tiger Prison, Nan Gong Yuqing in white robes wielded his sword, a smile on his face. A blood-red blade sliced through the air toward Luo Tian, its edge composed of countless souls capable of destroying everything.

Seeing Nan Gong Yuqing’s crimson blade, Luo Tian’s face darkened—Nan Gong Yuqing was the strongest young man he’d encountered in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Yet Luo Tian stood still, not dodging as the formidable blade approached with apocalyptic power.

“Killing Soul Blade! My master used it!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates gaped, their mouths forming an ‘o.’

“This blade I can’t withstand!” Tu Hongfei’s eyes widened, staring at the crimson blade. He felt a sense of helplessness—its power was beyond his ability to resist.

Ma Yingming’s eyes gleamed with sharpness, surprised by Nan Gong Yuqing’s strength. A single blade had left him trembling—how could he have thought Tu Hongfei and Jin Jinglong were the strongest? It felt like a joke.

As they mused, the crimson blade arrived at Luo Tian’s front. Wind surged, and before it reached him, his long hair fluttered, painting his determined face blood-red.

Luo Tian grabbed the Rending Sky Spear and held it before him, summoning eight Original Sources without using other defenses—like blocking a normal attack.

“Too overconfident! This blade, Luo Tian only defends lightly!” Chen He Guang and the dozens of elders following Luo Tian looked worried.

“Boom…” As they spoke, the crimson blade collided with the Rending Sky Spear. Sparks flew, thunder roared, and Luo Tian was pushed back, his ground tiles torn into grooves.

“Ten zhang… hundred zhang… thousand zhang…” Luo Tian retreated a thousand zhang before stopping, his clothes in tatters.

The black Rending Sky Spear bore a deep mark, emitting mournful cries.

“First strike!” Luo Tian panted, leaping into the sky to face Nan Gong Yuqing.

The crowd gasped at Luo Tian’s ability to withstand the attack. Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates were stunned.

Even Nan Gong Yuqing’s face shifted—unaware his Killing Soul Blade had only made Luo Tian retreat. He’d expected at least a blood spurt from him.

Now, though battered, Luo Tian had no injuries—this surprised Nan Gong Yuqing greatly.

“You’ve truly intrigued me!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s gaze was flirtatious, his sword slicing again. Two crimson blades flew toward Luo Tian, their power overwhelming.

“Second strike! Third strike!” Luo Tian roared, clenching his numb hands and holding the spear before him, his gaze fearless.

“Boom… boom…” The two collisions echoed again, but this time Luo Tian didn’t retreat. He stood in the sky, his brow furrowed.

“You’re holding back?” Luo Tian asked, running a hand over the spear. The two blades had been powerful but weaker than the first.

“Three strikes are done. Now comes the real attack! Prepare yourself!” Nan Gong Yuqing ignored Luo Tian’s words, switching from one-handed to two-handed grip.

“Roar…” A low roar echoed from Nan Gong Yuqing’s blood-red sword, gathering into a massive blade image that loomed over the sky, crushing down toward Luo Tian.
