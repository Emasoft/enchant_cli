“Hum……” As the Soul-Eating Beast was marveling at Luo Tian’s astonishing talent, Luo Tian’s figure vanished from the spot in an instant, appearing before the altar through the gray mist.

“Senior, I have arrived!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with reverence. Earlier, the Soul-Eating Beast had been momentarily dazed; if not for that, it might have intensified its soul-consuming mist, leaving Luo Tian no chance to ascend.

“You…” The Soul-Eating Beast’s gaze flickered as it saw Luo Tian at the altar’s base. It inwardly cursed its own carelessness, intending to retract its promise but knowing its status would shame Miaoyin and Zhongli Tian.

“Enough, enough. What use is it to borrow you? I’ve guessed your intent. But whether you succeed depends on yourself!” The Soul-Eating Beast nodded its massive head, transmitting thoughts to Luo Tian.

“Thank you, Senior!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with joy, bowing and clasping his fists in gratitude.

“Roar!” After speaking, the Soul-Eating Beast let out a thunderous roar. Its voice alone shattered the heavens, causing Luo Tian’s mind to ring with deafening echoes.

“What power does this Soul-Eating Beast possess? I can’t fathom it!” Luo Tian marveled inwardly. Due to the Soul-Eating Beast’s position atop the altar, its power was obscured by the altar itself, leaving Luo Tian unable to gauge its true strength.

After roaring, the Soul-Eating Beast slowly rose, its massive body exhaling swirling gray mist that solidified into seal characters. These encircled Zhongli Tian’s seated body, gradually merging into his flesh.

“Go! Test it. Zhongli Tian’s physical form can remain here for a month—enough, I suppose. Within that time, you must return it; otherwise, the consequences are yours to bear!” The Soul-Eating Beast resumed its seat on the altar.

As the gray mist merged into Zhongli Tian’s body, his overwhelming aura dissipated, leaving him as a mere mortal. If not for Luo Tian’s knowledge, one might have mistaken him for a living being.

“Thank you, Senior!” Luo Tian bowed and clasped his fists, leaping onto the altar to kneel three times before Zhongli Tian’s body. His gaze swept over the formidable physique, filled with awe.

“An Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body—when will I reach such a level? Even if not equal to the Epoch Lord, it must be near!” Luo Tian’s admiration was boundless. He had finally obtained it but chose not to enact his plan immediately, uncertain if success might trigger unforeseen calamities. Only in the end would he unveil this ultimate ace.

“Then I’ll take my leave!” After retrieving Zhongli Tian’s body, Luo Tian wore an air of reverence, thanking the Soul-Eating Beast again before flying down from the altar.

“Go! Go! Go! Remember to return Zhongli Tian’s body! If you harbor ill intent, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” The Soul-Eating Beast, now irritated by Luo Tian’s presence, expelled him from the domain.

“Indeed, I must hasten. I wonder how the Thunder Domain fares? Now, I fear no one!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with battlelust, sensing his unprecedented strength. Even in the Epoch’s early stages, he felt confident enough to confront it with his myriad techniques.

“Ming Yongzhi nearly annihilated me in the Mortal Domain. Though it took time, a gentleman’s revenge takes ten years—now is my turn! The blood debt of the Four Sacred Star Domains must be settled!” Luo Tian’s eyes brimmed with killing intent, gazing at the familiar Four Sacred Star Domains awash in blood qi. His heart ached deeply.

“Hum……” A moment later, Luo Tian’s figure vanished from the spot, rushing toward the Flame Domain.

“This brat remains untrustworthy. I cannot leave this altar; you must go. If anything happens to the master’s body, return it promptly!” The Soul-Eating Beast’s gaze darkened as it watched Luo Tian disappear, addressing the cliff.

“Yes!” As the Soul-Eating Beast’s words faded, a weathered voice echoed from the Cliff of Broken Gods. A withered figure stood there, its body emaciated, surrounded by seal characters, moving stiffly yet radiating an awe-inspiring aura.

If Luo Tian were here, he would recall this withered figure—the terrifying presence he first sensed at the Cliff of Broken Gods. Yet, after several visits to the cliff, he had never felt that aura again and thus forgotten it.

“Creak…” The withered form vanished into the void, as if never existed, disappearing from the Cliff of Broken Gods.

“Only ensure the master’s body remains safe; the rest matters not. Who dares, I shall kill!” The Soul-Eating Beast’s gaze held coldness as its voice echoed across the cliff.

Chapter 1,193: Entrust It to Me ()

Thunder Domain, the battlefield of destiny. The vast thunder-sea marshes churned ceaselessly, blood qi spreading from miles away, rapidly diffusing across the Thunder Domain. Like the Four Sacred Star Domains, a colossal array barrier enveloped the domain, channeling the endless blood qi into the void, merging it into the vast continents of the Mortal Domain.

“Kill!” The cries of battle erupted, countless martial arts clashing like the apocalypse, shattering the cosmos. The scene was极致惨烈.

Nan Gong Yuqing and others, their robes stained with blood, bore exhaustion. Three days of battle had left both the Mortal Domain and the Eight Domains’ combined forces battered.

“Will you still resist?” Ming Hun, Ming Li, and the other nine Mortal Domain disciples led dozens of Sage Peak warriors, gazing down at the Eight Domains’ prodigies.

After three days of combat, the Eight Domains’ alliance had two million troops—though numerically superior, they were scattered and had lost over a million, leaving only hundreds of thousands to desperately hold.

Conversely, the Mortal Domain had also suffered heavy losses, eliminating a million of the Eight Domains’ forces. Yet they still fielded five hundred thousand warriors, bolstered by Ming Hun and the nine disciples plus dozens of Sage Peak masters. This formidable elite force was terrifying.

“Without resistance, is there any path to survival?” Nan Gong Yuqing and his allies gathered, locking eyes with Ming Hun.

“Kill!” Both sides, bloodied and frenzied, clashed again after a brief pause.

Ming Hun and the nine disciples wielded the Mortal God Sword, charging toward Nan Gong Yuqing with the ferocity of a bloodthirsty god. Their momentum surged even higher.

“Annihilation of the Heavens!” Nan Gong Yuqing, a Sage Peak master who had slain countless foes, was the only one among his group capable of matching Ming Hun.

Luo Xiong and Sha Cangmang, veteran masters, were bloodied and wounded but still charged toward the Mortal Domain’s forces.

“This can’t continue! No one is stopping those Mortal Domain Sage Peak masters; our forces will be annihilated!” The Eight Domains’ combined army felt heavy-hearted, watching the unchallenged Mortal Domain masters wreak havoc.

“But what can we do?” Their hearts trembled; their strength was inferior to the Mortal Domain’s, leaving them no choice but to endure.

“Boom!” Nan Gong Yuqing clashed with Ming Hun, their bodies retreating a hundred paces. In the collision, countless allied troops were obliterated by their fluctuations.

“Not bad,” Ming Hun’s eyes gleamed, surprised by Nan Gong Yuqing’s strength.

“You’re not bad either, but you lack the qualification to kill me!” Nan Gong Yuqing wielded a blood-red sword, his body wreathed in black qi. His long hair flew as he loomed like a god of war, gazing at Ming Hun.

“You’re too arrogant! In my eyes, among the Nine Domains’ peers, only Luo Tian is my match. The rest are nothing! Those so-called Nine Reincarnations are trash! Especially you!” The Mortal God Sword descended upon Nan Gong Yuqing.

A gray line sliced through the void, appearing beside Nan Gong Yuqing in an instant, startling him.

“Fast!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s eyes narrowed, then his body shifted—but still felt a chill on his shoulder as blood spurted.

“Epoch Power!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s face twisted in horror, sensing the Epoch Power invading his body and corroding his flesh.

Dark qi surged as he struggled to expel the Epoch Power, his face pale.

“Luo Tian never told you, this Mortal God Sword is a relic forged by the Epoch Lord. You cannot withstand it!” Ming Hun smiled, his body flickering as he reappeared beside Nan Gong Yuqing, launching a punch.

“Boom!” At the same time, the remaining eight Mortal Domain disciples clashed with Gu Lei and Zheng Xin. Their situation was no better—constrained by the Mortal God Sword, they suffered suppression and frequent injuries.

Nan Gong Yuqing’s face darkened; the Eight Domains’ alliance was utterly suppressed, unable to match the Mortal Domain’s forces.

“Haha! Lord of the Demon Sect, Master of the Starry Domain—surrender! Join us, and you may live. Otherwise, only annihilation awaits!” In the void, Ming Yongzhi wielded the Blood-Soaked Vessel, overpowering Master of the Starry Domain and the Lord of the Demon Sect. Without their two Epoch Relics, they would have already lost.

“Damn it! Where are the Shattered Domain, Divine Race, and Beast Domain? Why haven’t they aided us?” The Lord of the Demon Sect’s face darkened, cursing inwardly. Other domain masters had yet to arrive.

“You’ll all die! Even if those Sage Race domain masters come, you still die. No one can stop the Mortal Domain’s advance!” Ming Yongzhi’s face twisted with ferocity. Without Epoch-level masters, he was the absolute ruler—no one could oppose him, not even two half-Epoch masters.

“Luo Tian! Why aren’t you here yet? If you don’t come soon, I’ll really be dead!” Xu Liyi cursed, his body battered and helpless against the Mortal God Sword.

“Haha! What can one Luo Tian do? Even if he arrives, what can he achieve?” Ming Li’s face darkened as he chased Xu Liyi with the Mortal God Sword.

“If Luo Tian arrives, you’re nothing! He nearly killed me before; if not for the Mortal Domain’s reinforcements, I’d be dead!” Gu Lei and others cursed, dodging Ming Yuan’s relentless attacks.

“Die!” Ming Yuan, enraged by Gu Lei’s words, lunged forward with the Mortal God Sword.

The sword glowed blood-red, appearing beside Gu Lei instantly. His defense was pierced, the blade aiming for his chest.

“What in hell is this thing!” Gu Lei waved his hand, summoning the Spirit Transport Vessel above Ming Yuan’s head to crush him.

“Sacrifice for victory!” Ming Yuan’s eyes flashed, sensing the vessel’s overwhelming pressure. Knowing Luo Tian and Gu Lei were close, he decided to risk everything—endure Gu Lei’s attack to kill him.

“Damn it!” Seeing Ming Yuan’s resolve, Gu Lei lamented the Mortal Domain’s ruthlessness toward their own.

Cold qi instantly invaded his body, making Gu Lei bitter. Though his attack was powerful, he doubted the Spirit Transport Vessel could kill Ming Yuan. But if the Mortal God Sword fully pierced his body, he’d be dead.

In an instant, Gu Lei’s mind raced but found no solution to the crisis.

“Damn it! I’m the first to die!” Gu Lei’s eyes hardened, channeling all his strength into the Spirit Transport Vessel, determined to kill Ming Yuan in his final moments.

“You little brat! You’ve finally arrived! If you’d come a moment later, I’d be sending black-haired men to white!” Luo Xiong’s pale face showed relief as he and Long Jian, Sha Cangmang, fought a Sage Peak master.

“Sorry I’m late!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness, his eyes filled with regret as he gazed at the remaining hundreds of thousands of Eight Domains’ forces. The losses were catastrophic—supporters from the Four Sacred Star and Flame Domains had also suffered heavily, with a million troops reduced to less than ten percent.

“Since I’m here, leave it all to me. You can rest!” Luo Tian’s cold gaze swept over the remaining three hundred thousand Mortal Domain troops. He addressed them, his voice resolute.

Chapter 1,194: Unparalleled Might ()

“Arrogant!” Ming Hun’s face darkened at Luo Tian’s words, retreating Nan Gong Yuqing with a punch. Without hesitation, he wielded the Mortal God Sword toward Luo Tian.

“I’ll see what you’re made of—dare to face us all!” Ming Hun roared, becoming a streak of darkness that appeared beside Luo Tian instantly. The sword lunged for his throat.

“Hmph.” Nan Gong Yuqing sighed, watching Luo Tian with a smile. He knew Luo Tian never spoke in vain; if he claimed confidence, it was genuine.

Others also disengaged from their opponents, gathering to watch Luo Tian’s transformation after his absence.

“Previously, I might have hesitated a little, but now you’re nothing to me!” Luo Tian sneered, his hand snatching Ming Hun’s wrist with lightning speed. Simultaneously, he launched a punch.

“What?” Ming Hun’s eyes widened in shock—Luo Tian had effortlessly seized his wrist, causing panic. Yet Ming Hun was a peerless prodigy; even at Luo Tian’s Sage Peak, he had to be cautious.

In panic, Ming Hun swung his other hand, its arm etched with gray seal characters, striking Luo Tian.

“Crack!” A thunderous sound erupted from their fists colliding, the power of the Dao spreading outward as windstorms.

People watched as Ming Hun was hurled backward like a broken kite, his body riddled with cracks and spitting blood. His arm holding the Mortal God Sword was torn off by Luo Tian.

“Half-Epoch!” People gasped, gazing at Luo Tian standing resolutely in the starry void. Though alone, he loomed like a mountain, blocking the Mortal Domain’s forces.

“Join hands and kill him!” A Sage Peak master shouted, his hands radiating terrifying fluctuations.

Hearing the shout, the Mortal Domain’s forces rushed forward, unleashing countless powerful martial arts. Like raindrops, they streaked through the void toward Luo Tian.

“Haphazard troops!” Luo Tian scoffed, unimpressed by their arts. Though powerful, if it were his Sage Peak self, he might have dodged. But now, confident in his body, he unleashed Half-Epoch power, creating a radiant light to shield himself and the Eight Domains’ forces.

“Boom!” The arts collided with Luo Tian’s barrier, shattering and exploding in a continuous roar. Gray qi enveloped them all.

“Luo Tian’s might!” Before the gray qi dispersed, someone shouted, their voice filled with excitement.

“Luo Tian’s might!” The Eight Domains’ forces stood behind Luo Tian, witnessing the arts disintegrate and feeling his power. They couldn’t help but shout in unison.

At this moment, Luo Tian was their god. Regardless of origin, after such a massive war, they had been bloodied and felt life’s cheapness. Their domain masters hadn’t aided them, but Luo Tian had arrived late yet chosen to fight the remaining three hundred thousand Mortal Domain troops alone. What audacity!

“Talents should be like this—unconquered for life! Luo Tian possesses the potential of an Epoch Lord!” Their eyes held respect, as if seeing a younger version of the Epoch Lord.

“Enter the Demon Realm!” Luo Tian sighed, his dantian reversed, black demon qi spilling from his body, swirling around him.

As Luo Tian’s power grew, entering the Demon Realm offered little enhancement, but it allowed him to unleash his favored art: Seven Demon Blades.

“Kill him!” Ming Hun’s face paled as his severed arm regenerated, the Mortal God Sword returning to his hand. A strong sense of crisis gripped him—not just his own, but the entire Mortal Domain’s. He felt Luo Tian might be the greatest stepping stone in their plan.

“Yes!” The Mortal Domain’s forces, fearless of death, rushed toward Luo Tian. Two to three million warriors formed a gray tide, overturning vast starfields as if crushing Luo Tian.

“Reverse Heaven’s Seven Demon Blades—First Blade!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, his black demon blade materializing and expanding into a sky-piercing slash.

The blade resembled a crescent moon, like a reaper’s sickle, instantly sweeping through the Mortal Domain forces.

Flesh and blood scattered; dozens of thousands were slain in an instant, vanishing under Luo Tian’s blade.

“Second Blade… Third Blade…” Luo Tian showed no mercy, no guilt for killing so many. He knew they all deserved death—each hand stained with blood. If they lived, more Nine Domains’ people would die at their hands.

Six sky-piercing slashes were unleashed, their might terrifying. The stars split into pieces, instantly sweeping through the Mortal Domain’s ranks.

Limbs flew; the Mortal Domain forces were mowed down like wheat, annihilated by the six blades. In an instant, fewer than a hundred remained standing.

“Half-Epoch is terrifying—truly a domain master’s power, capable of turning the tide alone!” The Eight Domains’ forces bore reverence as they gazed at Luo Tian, now a Half-Epoch master.

Conversely, Ming Hun’s face was pale; his grip on the Mortal God Sword trembled. The previous blade’s might had been overwhelming, even forcing him to cautiously coordinate with Ming Li and others to protect the remaining hundred.

“Use that technique; otherwise, we have no chance!” Ming Hun’s gaze deepened as he addressed the others. He decided to summon the Epoch Lord’s projection within the Mortal God Sword, exterminating Luo Tian.

“Mortal God Sword of Annihilation!” Ming Hun’s hands moved swiftly, the sword flashing bloodlight. A crimson phantom appeared, though just a shadow, its aura suffocating.

Not only Ming Hun, but the remaining seven disciples also wielded identical Mortal God Swords, cutting their wrists to let a drop of blood merge into the sword.

Bloodlight flickered; with Ming Hun’s phantom, eight figures appeared, each suffocating.

“Pity only eight; Ming Yuan, that fool, wasted it before. If nine phantoms merged, they’d be invincible! They could unleash one percent of the Epoch Lord’s power!” Ming Hun sighed softly.

After summoning the Epoch Lord’s figure, Ming Hun and the remaining disciples didn’t stop but chanted seal characters onto the eight phantoms.

“Hum…” In people’s awe, the eight phantoms fused, solidifying into one. Hollow eyes glowed red, charging toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it! I forgot they had this trick!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled, recalling the helplessness at the Cliff of Broken Gods.

“Luo Tian, die!” Ming Hun’s face twisted with ferocity, shouting wildly.

“Turtle Shell Yin Fish!” Luo Tian chanted, summoning the Turtle Shell Yin Fish to block the two red glows.

“Sizzle…” The Yin Fish Turtle Shell, a fragment of an Epoch Relic, withstood the Epoch Lord’s attack. Luo Tian felt relief.

“Familiar Epoch Lord aura!” The Yin Fish Turtle Shell’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, filled with excitement.

“Damn it! The phantoms’ Epoch Power is too strong. If I could merge it into the Yin Fish, my strength would soar!” The Yin Fish artifact spirit’s eyes gleamed with excitement, urging Luo Tian to attack the phantom.

“If I could beat it, would I summon you?” Luo Tian felt the Yin Fish spirit was increasingly unreliable.

“Don’t worry; I’ll help you—no failure!” The Yin Fish spirit was confident. If it were a true Epoch Relic, he might have feared it, but this was merely a Mortal God Sword forged by the Epoch Lord—nothing to him.

“Ah?” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up; he knew the phantom’s terror. A mistake could cost him his life, even as a new Half-Epoch master.

“You forgot—your the Turtle Shell’s master! The Epoch-level bones within it can be commanded. If you summon them, what fear is there of this fake Epoch Lord!” The Yin Fish spirit sneered.

“Right!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened, recalling the Epoch-level bones in the Turtle Shell Yin Fish that had nearly killed him. He waved his hand, black seal characters merging into the shell.

Chapter 1,195: Battle with Ming Yongzhi ()

Black seal characters merged into the black Turtle Shell. Luo Tian’s vast spiritual awareness surged into it, instantly sensing the chaotic Epoch-level bones within the space.

“Epoch Lord isn’t a mere rank. Bones from Epoch Early and Mid stages aren’t worth considering—absolutely can’t withstand the merged phantom!” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, spotting a few Epoch Late and Peak bones.

A white bone rod—though long dead—still radiated power, making Luo Tian’s heart leap. He marveled at the wealth left by the God of Beasts and Spirits for those who obtained the Turtle Shell Yin Fish.

“Kid, how’s my plan? Sacrifice all these bones; even Epoch Mid would crumble under the strike!”

“Hmph.” Luo Tian nodded inwardly but knew he couldn’t command all the bones in the space.

“Hmph?” His vast spiritual awareness then detected the Yin Fish spirit’s bone-built body, his eyes gleaming.

“Go ahead—take as much as you want!” The Yin Fish spirit boasted, patting his bony shoulders with a creaking sound. He knew Luo Tian couldn’t command so many bones.

“Then I’ll be bold!” Luo Tian and the Yin Fish spirit exchanged thoughts through spiritual links.

After speaking, Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness-formed figure pointed a finger, his immense spiritual power instantly sweeping over the Yin Fish spirit’s bony body. He sent it outside the Turtle Shell Yin Fish.

“Ah? What’s going on, you bastard! You dare to cheat me!” The Yin Fish spirit shouted, appearing in people’s sight.

“Senior, you said to take as much as I wanted. I think your bony body is quite good—probably all Epoch Peak bones!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the Yin Fish spirit.

“You bastard!” The Yin Fish spirit’s ghostly face turned sour, instantly pushed by Luo Tian in front of Ming Hun and others’ Epoch Lord phantoms.

“What’s going on?” People were stunned, gazing at the Yin Fish spirit’s ghostly form with confusion.

“Who is that skeleton? I’m a bit confused!” Zheng Xin’s eyes held doubt, asking.

“Kid, watch your words—my name is the Great God of Beasts and Spirits!”

“The God of Beasts and Spirits? Impossible!” Before the Yin Fish spirit’s words ended, people scoffed, their eyes filled with disdain.

“The artifact spirit of the God of Beasts and Spirits’ Dao Map!” The Yin Fish spirit, having been out for a long time, spoke with heavy breaths.

“Damn it! No wonder—this is just an artifact spirit. I thought the God of Beasts and Spirits would be so powerful!” People’s eyes widened with realization.

“Beware!”

As the Yin Fish spirit boasted, Luo Tian, who had been observing the phantom, suddenly shouted.

“Crack!” But Luo Tian’s words were too late; a blood-red hand smashed through the void, striking the Yin Fish spirit’s bony frame.

“What artifact spirit? In front of my Mortal Domain’s true Epoch Lord, all are crushed!” Ming Hun sneered at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, you truly have talent—finding a bony frame to help!” Several disciples sneered.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The void collapsed repeatedly, even as Luo Tian and others fought Ming Yongzhi, the Lord of the Demon Sect, and Master of the Starry Domain, they were swept out by the powerful fluctuations.

“You!” Ming Yongzhi saw the Mortal Domain’s forces reduced to a hundred or so, his face darkened. He glared at Ming Hun.

“Luo Tian!” But soon, he saw Luo Tian standing among the crowd, his eyes burning with murderous intent.

“I am.” Luo Tian’s gaze was calm, answering without retreat, locking eyes with Ming Yongzhi.

Thunder roared; two lightning bolts spread from their mutual gaze, forming an invisible storm that swept over everyone’s robes.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve grown so fast—so quickly becoming a Half-Epoch master!” Ming Yongzhi’s eyes glowed with admiration, sensing Luo Tian’s threat. How long had it been since that day when he nearly annihilated him, needing Meng Lingyun’s残魂 to protect himself? Now, Luo Tian could threaten him.

“You haven’t guessed many things yet. I’ve come to repay my grudge—traitor and murderer!” Luo Tian’s cold gaze flashed, his Turtle Shell Yin Fish hovering above his head. He gripped the golden Rupture Spear, his battle spirit rising.

“Cough! Damn it! As the Epoch Lord, even a projection, you still dare to ambush!” As both sides were ready for battle, the Yin Fish spirit appeared in people’s sight. His bony body bore seal patterns, slowly merging.

“This…” People gazed at the Yin Fish spirit with shock, their eyes changing.

That attack seemed ordinary, but they felt the phantom’s terrifying pressure—Epoch Lord’s strike, though a projection, was world-destroying. Yet this skeleton spirit remained unscathed, appearing lively in their sight.

“What is this spirit made of?” People gasped, realizing the Yin Fish spirit’s uniqueness. Especially its bone body radiated immense divine power, leaving people awestruck.

“That’s Epoch Peak bones—entirely forged from Epoch Peak bones!” Ming Yongzhi’s gaze darkened, recognizing the Yin Fish spirit’s bone body.

“My god! Epoch Peak bones!” People gasped, their eyes filled with fervor, drooling.

Epoch Peak bones—how precious! Everyone envied them; each could forge supreme relics. This spirit had used such a relic to craft its bony body.

“Damn it! I’m furious—what is the Epoch Lord? In front of the God of Beasts and Spirits, you’re trash! Today, even if your true self comes, I’ll kill you!” The Yin Fish spirit roared, black flames flickering in its skull. Its ghostly form swayed.

“Hum…” The hum of the Turtle Shell Yin Fish echoed, instantly vanishing from Luo Tian’s head to appear beside the Yin Fish spirit.

The bony hand struck, thunderous sound returned. Bones emerged from the Turtle Shell Yin Fish—each radiating immense pressure.

“Ten… a hundred…” As people gazed in shock, bones appeared one by one.

“Creak!” Under the Yin Fish spirit’s control, countless bones formed a massive bone dragon circling above it.

“My god! This is the artifact spirit of the God of Beasts and Spirits! What a terrifying power! Even this half-relic could be so fearsome—imagine if it were a true Epoch Relic!” People’s hearts screamed, astonished by the Yin Fish spirit’s hidden power.

“Roar!” The next moment, the Yin Fish spirit led the bone dragon toward the red Epoch Lord’s projection, clashing with it.

“Without this Epoch Lord’s projection, what are you?” Luo Tian smiled, gripping the Rupture Spear, gazing at Ming Hun.

“You!” Ming Hun’s face was in despair; now Luo Tian was Half-Epoch, clearly outmatching him.

“Die!” Luo Tian wielded the golden Rupture Spear, instantly appearing beside Ming Hun. The spear lunged for his chest without hesitation.

“Roar!” But as the spear neared Ming Hun’s heart, a blood-red dragon instantly blocked it, shielding Ming Hun and the remaining seven disciples. They were swept into the void.

“Hum…” The hum of the copper vessel echoed, absorbing Ming Hun and the seven disciples into the Blood-Soaked Vessel.

“Killing before me—how naive!” Ming Yongzhi’s voice was cold as he addressed Luo Tian. He had to admit, Luo Tian now deserved his attention.

“Then I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian moved, appearing before Ming Yongzhi without fear. The golden Rupture Spear hummed.

“Luo Tian, we’ll help you!” The Lord of the Demon Sect and Master of the Starry Domain flew to Luo Tian’s side. Clearly, one man couldn’t defeat Ming Yongzhi alone.

“Thank you, seniors!” Luo Tian clasped his fists in gratitude. Without their constant interception of Ming Yongzhi, the Thunder Domain might have already fallen to the Mortal Domain.
