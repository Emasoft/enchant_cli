“Brilliant!” Upon hearing Wan Lingkong’s words, the crowd's faces naturally bore expressions of admiration. None had expected that Wan Lingkong could withstand this heavenly array for a full fifteen minutes.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian and Sun Kemin exchanged glances, unwilling to waste time. Under the worried gazes of Sun Mengru and others, they approached the ancient coffin at the center of the hall.

However, as the two took their first steps forward, their expressions darkened slightly. An invisible pressure descended upon their bodies.

“Hum…” As the two just moved, Run Hongyu appeared behind them, a smile on his face.

“I’ll accompany you,” Run Hongyu said, gazing at the ancient coffin. Though he did not know what lay within it, it was his father’s legacy.

“Good,” Luo Tian nodded without refusal. Run Hongyu bore the blood of the Tongtian Lord; perhaps it would yield miracles.

The three advanced shoulder to shoulder, enduring the immense pressure step by step with utmost caution.

At present, their strength was formidable. Though the pressure was overwhelming, it posed no real threat to them now. Yet they knew this was only the beginning; if they continued forward, the pressure might intensify further—perhaps even proving insurmountable.

“Unknown if it will work,” Diao Dezhu and others bore expressions of concern as they watched Luo Tian and the others inch closer to the coffin.

Time flowed slowly. The pressure grew stronger with each step, even for the three of them who were already at their peak.

“Hum…” Luo Tian and Sun Kemin conjured the Yin-Yang Twin Fish, which hovered above their heads. Black and white qi enveloped them instantly, reducing the pressure and allowing them to reach the emerald coffin.

Upon close inspection, their faces immediately bore expressions of awe. It felt as if a supreme being sat before them, evoking an urge to prostrate themselves.

“Clatter clatter…” Sun Kemin stood beneath the Yin-Yang Twin Fish, skillfully retrieving various tools with an excited expression.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian and Run Hongyu remained cautious, eyes fixed on the emerald coffin, wary of any sudden changes.

“Clatter clatter…” Sun Kemin then took up the tools, beginning to strike the coffin with a series of clinks. A string of inscriptions emerged from his hands, etched into the coffin.

“Sun Kemin, you bastard, hurry up—the time is running out!” Wan Lingkong bellowed at Sun Kemin, causing his face to shift slightly.

“Don’t be loud!” Sun Kemin turned and cursed at Wan Lingkong, his forehead drenched in sweat, eyes now solemn.

“Prepare—it’s about to open! Run Hongyu, drip a single drop of your blood onto the coffin!” Sun Kemin spoke gravely.

“Understood,” Run Hongyu replied without hesitation. He extended a hand, and emerald-hued blood shot forth from it, landing on the coffin.

Sun Kemin moved swiftly, launching a yellow talisman that adhered to the blood.

“Sizzle…” The yellow talisman ignited instantly. Sun Kemin then leapt upward, standing atop the coffin lid.

“Open!” Sun Kemin roared, his arms flexing as he lifted the lid with all his might.

Luo Tian and Run Hongyu stood before him, yet they did not assist in lifting the lid. Instead, their eyes remained fixed on the narrow gap of the coffin.

“Hum…” Radiant light surged forth, golden beams rising from the fissure. Misty vapor exuded continuously, causing Luo Tian and Run Hongyu to display a glimmer of joy.

“Good omen!” Seeing the golden light and misty vapor, Diao Dezhu and others felt a surge of hope.

“Open!” Sun Kemin roared again, his aura flickering as he exerted himself to lift the lid. The emerald coffin was abruptly pried open.

“Roar…” A deep roar echoed through the hall, filling it with golden light. Terrifying waves of energy surged forth, instantly sending Luo Tian and Sun Kemin flying, their bodies colliding violently with the hall’s walls.

Those standing at the second-floor entrance—Sun Mengru, Diao Dezhu, and others—wore expressions of shock as they were struck by the overwhelming aura.

“Roar…” A nine-heaven true dragon emerged from the bone dragons coiled on the ground, instantly vanishing into the opened coffin.

“What did you see?” Diao Dezhu and others, their faces pale, asked Luo Tian and Sun Kemin.

“But what about Run Hongyu?” Before they could answer, Zheng Xin and others noticed that Run Hongyu had not been blown away but stood trembling with his back to them.

Chapter 1594: Saving Run Hongyu

Blinding divine light and surging waves filled the entire hall. Outside the emerald coffin, Run Hongyu stood trembling, his back to Luo Tian and others. The waves of energy blew against his body, his robes fluttering, long hair飞扬.

“What’s going on? What lies within that coffin? Why wasn’t Run Hongyu blown away?” Diao Dezhu and others asked Luo Tian and Sun Kemin, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Yes, what did you see?” Their minds were puzzled. That wave of energy had even sent Luo Tian flying—how could Run Hongyu have remained?

“Didn’t see…” I tried to look inside, but was blown away immediately. I couldn’t see anything,” Sun Kemin shouted.

“I didn’t either. That golden light was too blinding; I felt my eyes might burst!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, sensing they had stumbled into trouble.

“What now? Is he receiving the inheritance?” Sun Mengru asked Luo Tian, her face puzzled as she observed Run Hongyu’s odd state.

“Wait a moment,” Luo Tian frowned. Though he was envious of the Tongtian Lord’s inheritance, if Run Hongyu had obtained it, there was no need to compete.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Diao Dezhu and others fell silent. Their eyes remained fixed on Run Hongyu, fearing any sudden change—this coffin exuded an ominous aura from start to finish.

The golden light gradually faded, and the waves of energy finally calmed. Yet the entire hall was in ruins; even the九龙拱珠 (Nine Dragon Phoenix Formation) previously arranged by someone had been scattered by the powerful waves, with white bones scattered across the floor.

“Roar…” As time flowed slowly, a deep dragon roar echoed through the hall. The scattered white bones began to gather, forming into massive bone dragons that circled around the jade coffin.

This time, however, they did not remain still but began to move slowly, as if awakened, drifting toward the emerald coffin.

“Creak… creak…” The bones scraped against the ground, emitting a piercing sound. As they circled, nine massive bone dragons gradually shrank, finally coiling around Run Hongyu’s body.

“Something is wrong!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light. As the waves and blinding golden light faded, he finally saw Run Hongyu’s condition.

“Impossible!” Sun Kemin’s forehead split open, a celestial eye blinking. Like Luo Tian, he had also seen Run Hongyu’s state.

His eyes revealed that Run Hongyu hadn’t been blown away but was unable to move, his body trembling violently from continuous struggle.

A withered hand clutched Run Hongyu’s neck, rendering him immobile. The nine bone dragons coiled around his body, their sharp spines piercing through his flesh. Blood gushed from Run Hongyu’s body, trickling down the withered arm into the emerald coffin.

“Thump… thump… thump…”

A powerful aura emanated from the emerald coffin, as if a terrifying presence was slowly awakening. A series of heartbeats echoed through the hall.

“The coffin’s entity is sacrificing Run Hongyu!” Luo Tian moved swiftly, his face grim as he rushed toward Run Hongyu. At the same time, the Yin Fish appeared above his head.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin’s faces also shifted sharply. They quickly followed Luo Tian toward Run Hongyu.

“Roar…” However, as they took their first steps forward, nine white bone dragons shot forth from Run Hongyu’s body. Having absorbed Run Hongyu’s blood, their power had grown stronger. Even Diao Dezhu and others who had recently enhanced their strength felt a surge of fear.

“You hold back these nine bone dragons; I’ll save Run Hongyu!” Luo Tian instructed Sun Mengru and others, fearing for Run Hongyu’s life. It had been a while now, and Luo Tian even noticed that Run Hongyu had stopped struggling, his body convulsing slightly.

“Hum…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Mengru’s golden divine sword radiated a brilliant light, immediately confronting two bone dragons.

Others distributed the remaining dragons, leaving Luo Tian alone to rush toward Run Hongyu.

Without the immense pressure, he was at the coffin’s top in an instant, standing before Run Hongyu.

“Ugh… ugh…” Run Hongyu seemed to have his life’s essence seized, his face pale as a sheet of paper.

Blood trickled down the withered hand into the emerald coffin. Luo Tian gazed downward but was obscured by a mist, unable to discern anything.

“Hum…” The Blue Thunder Sword fell into Luo Tian’s hand. A series of blue lightning surrounded the sword, illuminating his eyes.

“Sword Without Borders!” The Blue Thunder Sword erupted with a radiant blue light, imbued with the special purifying power of lightning. Luo Tian fully channeled his strength into it, slicing at the withered arm.

“Crack…” Thunder crackled. The Blue Thunder Sword struck the withered arm, but Luo Tian’s face immediately turned grim.

What was his current cultivation? His body could withstand attacks from a Pro-Epoch Lord. His strength had also improved significantly, nearing the threshold of becoming a Pro-Epoch Lord.

Yet even with his full strength, the Blue Thunder Sword left only a white mark on the arm.

“Explosion…” Sparks flew. The Blue Thunder Sword instantly burst from Luo Tian’s hand, becoming a streak of light that vanished from his sight.

“Boom…” Xu Liyi struck the bone dragon’s massive body with a palm, his face showing disdain.

“A pile of bones—how dare they challenge me, Xu?” He began to speak but was interrupted by a sudden chill between his legs.

“Damn it, watch where you’re aiming…” Xu Liyi clutched his crotch, sweat pouring down his face. If that blade had been slightly off, he would have truly lost his honor.

Though their cultivation allowed them to recover easily, losing that part was too embarrassing. Xu Liyi had never faced such a humiliation.

“Pfft…” Before Xu Liyi’s words ended, the Blue Thunder Sword was embedded into the hall’s wall.

“Luo Tian!” Xu Liyi instantly recognized the Blue Thunder Sword. His face darkened, glancing toward Luo Tian.

Yet Xu Liyi had forgotten he was still battling the bone dragon. The dragon’s bony tail shattered space, striking Xu Liyi’s body.

“Boom…” Xu Liyi was thrown to the ground, his face displaying a pained expression: “Luo Tian, you really did me in!”

If it weren’t for Luo Tian, Xu Liyi would have already cursed him. However, he quickly leapt back into the fight toward the bone dragon.

“Damn it, what kind of body is this? How could there be such an abnormal physique in the world!” Luo Tian’s face bore shock. He didn’t respond to Xu Liyi’s resentful gaze but focused on the hand still gripping Run Hongyu’s throat.

Run Hongyu now appeared like a dying man, his eyes lifeless, his body withered slightly.

Compared to Run Hongyu, the previously withered hand had become more ruddy, gradually gaining a blood-like hue.

“Thump… thump… thump…” The intense heartbeat grew faster, a powerful aura emanating from the mist within the coffin. Even Luo Tian felt an immense pressure.

“Damn it, could there really be a Epoch Lord buried in here!” Luo Tian cursed involuntarily, sensing the situation was extremely complicated.

“Eight Gate Sealing Needles…” As Luo Tian felt the difficulty, a weak voice echoed in his mind. This was Run Hongyu’s voice.

Before Luo Tian could react, a sequence of acupoints appeared in his mind. Then Run Hongyu fell silent, his entire body turning white like a sheet of paper.

Luo Tian’s eyes were solemn. He reached for the silver needle pouch at Run Hongyu’s waist, a package he had never placed in his storage ring.

“Good thing I have the needle pouch!” Luo Tian then waved his hand, and the needle pouch unfolded before him. Eight silver needles flew out, hovering in front of Luo Tian. Under his control, they flew toward the blood-red arm.

“Hegu Point… Shaoshang Point… San Yang Luo… Shou Wu Li…” A series of silver glows flashed as the eight needles pierced into the eight acupoints on the withered arm.

“Hum…” What shocked Luo Tian next was that even though he had fully channeled the Blue Thunder Sword, it couldn’t move the arm. After all eight needles were inserted, however, the arm trembled slightly and then loosened its grip on Run Hongyu’s throat.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, catching Run Hongyu as he fell. A look of relief crossed his face. Then, Epoch Power surged from his hands into Run Hongyu’s body.

Chapter 1595: The Tongtian Lord

However, as Luo Tian’s Epoch Power entered Run Hongyu’s body, his face turned grim again. His eyes held a hint of bitterness.

“How could this be!” Luo Tian’s lips curled in bitterness. His perception revealed that Run Hongyu’s meridians were withered, and the withered hand had not only taken his blood but also his cultivation.

Run Hongyu’s current state was extremely dire. Even Luo Tian felt that his life hung by a thread.

“Immortal Divine Medicine!” Suddenly, Luo Tian remembered the Purple Lightning Lotus still with Run Hongyu. He grabbed Run Hongyu’s storage ring and crushed it between his fingers, turning it into dust.

“Clatter…” A pile of items spilled from the storage ring. Among them, the most eye-catching was the purple lotus surrounded by lightning.

“Hum…” Under Luo Tian’s control, the purple lotus landed before Run Hongyu. Powerful life energy surged into his body.

With the Immortal Divine Medicine present, Run Hongyu’s fading vitality was finally stabilized. Luo Tian sighed in relief.

Luo Tian waved his hand again, and a pill flew from his hand—his own creation, the Reverse Blood Pill.

Luo Tian had no choice. Run Hongyu’s blood was too weak; without the Reverse Blood Pill to stimulate it, he feared that Run Hongyu’s remaining blood power would vanish.

“Boom…” The Reverse Blood Pill immediately took effect. A series of thunderous sounds echoed within Run Hongyu’s body, causing his weak breathing to gradually become heavier.

After waiting anxiously, Run Hongyu finally opened his eyes. His expression bore a hint of bitterness, and his face had a sickly flush, as if he were on his deathbed.

“Thank you, Luo Tian!” Run Hongyu spoke softly. He then assessed his current state and sighed bitterly.

“You’re in such a dire condition now. I’ve given you a pill that can awaken your bloodline. Once the effects wear off, you’ll become an ordinary person. I wonder if you can withstand it!” Luo Tian sighed.

Luo Tian also felt guilty. He hadn’t expected this trip to the White Bone Forest would cost Run Hongyu his life.

“It’s fine… I’ve long accepted death. I just didn’t expect it would come so soon!” Run Hongyu’s face bore calmness, then a contemplative expression. His eyes gazed at the emerald coffin.

“Eight Gate Sealing Needles!” Run Hongyu murmured, his weak eyes flashing with light.

“Ah, I see. That’s why my father made me learn medicine so thoroughly, even valuing it more than my cultivation. Did he foresee this disaster for me?”

“Six Yin绝脉 (Six Yin Meridian), living no more than five hundred years. I’ve already lived past that. Is this my own disaster?” Run Hongyu’s eyes became excited.

“Ah, my father must have foreseen this disaster for me. That’s why he made me learn medicine so thoroughly!” Run Hongyu wanted to howl, but his weakness prevented it.

“Luo Tian, don’t worry about me. This disaster might be my greatest change—a chance to resolve my Six Yin Meridian!” Run Hongyu smiled slightly, gazing at Luo Tian. Yet this smile looked grim to Luo Tian.

“Though my meridians are withered, I’ll reforge them. With Immortal Divine Medicine and my medical skills, this is a chance for rebirth!” Run Hongyu spoke softly. He then waved his hand, and the silver needles flew toward him.

One needle after another fell, forming a series of cold glows that pierced Run Hongyu’s body. He looked like a hedgehog.

“Truly terrifying, the Epoch Lord—how could he foresee his son’s disaster? How did he do it?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed awe. He then relaxed, waved his hand, and a drop of Reincarnation Body’s essence blood flew from his hand. It landed on Run Hongyu’s forehead and entered his body.

“Hum…” After the essence blood entered Run Hongyu’s body, a series of humming sounds echoed within it. Run Hongyu’s body trembled slightly. He was at a critical moment, and the only missing element was essence blood. Luo Tian’s offering of a single drop was like giving him snow in the winter.

“Hope you succeed,” Luo Tian smiled, standing before Run Hongyu to guard him while also observing the others’ battles.

Now that their strength had improved, the nine bone dragons were no longer a threat. They were merely being held back by everyone. Only Sun Mengru and Chen Zhanbiao faced greater pressure, fighting two dragons each.

Luo Tian moved his hands slightly, generating radiant light to protect Run Hongyu. He also shifted his body toward Sun Mengru’s direction, aiming to ease her pressure.

However, as Luo Tian just stood up, a low roar rose from the coffin. The heartbeats that had made him anxious gradually accelerated and soon returned to a normal pace.

Luo Tian halted his body, his face grim as he gazed at the emerald coffin. His aura slowly rose. The Blue Thunder Sword returned to his hand.

“Who are you, daring to interfere here!” A low voice echoed from the coffin. A thin figure emerged from the mist within it, two glimmers of cold light bursting from its eyes.

At this moment, the entire hall felt unusually heavy. Even Sun Mengru, engaged in battle with several dragons, felt the immense pressure. Her combat techniques slowed slightly under this overwhelming force.

The mist cleared, revealing the thin figure’s true form. Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly; this was an old man, wearing a golden robe with disheveled hair. Yet his eyes were piercing and deep, like a golden vortex. Combined with his overwhelming aura, he exuded an isolated atmosphere—this was the feeling Luo Tian had only felt from an Epoch Lord.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian scrutinized the old man’s appearance, feeling a strange familiarity.

“Ah, I’ve waited for him long enough,” the old man chuckled. His withered fingers pointed at Run Hongyu, his face bearing a touch of沧桑 (sorrow).

“I am the Tongtian Lord!” The old man spoke softly, his voice calm yet sending Luo Tian into shock.

“Tongtian Lord…” Hearing the old man’s words, everyone’s bodies trembled. They even forgot they were fighting dragons, their faces filled with disbelief as a dragon struck them.

Luo Tian’s heart surged with waves. His eyes locked onto the old man, then glanced at Run Hongyu. He believed the old man’s words to an extent.

At this moment, Run Hongyu was also thin and gaunt. His appearance closely resembled the old man’s, convincing Luo Tian of his claim.

“How is this possible!” Luo Tian hadn’t expected to meet a living Epoch Lord here. This was a living Epoch Lord—such news would surely stir the entire Nine Realms.

Epoch Lords could live through two epochs. This was common knowledge since ancient times. Though their fates were unknown, people had a guess that these supreme beings had ascended to the Immortal Realm.

Yet this old man claimed to be the Tongtian Lord. This was too much for Luo Tian’s heart to bear.

“Impossible!” Then, Luo Tian’s mind became puzzled. He thought back to Run Hongyu nearly dying—this was clearly the old man’s doing. How could an Epoch Lord attack his own son?

Luo Tian stared intently at the old man, then felt more certain of his guess. This person was not the true Tongtian Lord.

Though this old man’s aura was formidable, Luo Tian was highly sensitive to spiritual essence. He could sense the old man’s spirit was fragile. If it were a true Epoch Lord, his spiritual essence would not be like this. If it were a living Epoch Lord, the combination of spiritual essence and physical pressure would have made him gasp for air. Moreover, Luo Tian sensed a sinister aura in this spiritual essence.

“Boy, your blood is strong. Once I absorb all of his blood, I’ll take you as well!” The old man smiled, then vanished like a ghost before Luo Tian’s eyes. His withered fist shot forward, striking Luo Tian.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with shock. The old man’s speed was too fast—unparalleled in his life. As the old man moved, Luo Tian immediately swung a punch to meet it.

“Crack…” A crackling sound rose from Luo Tian’s fist. His face was filled with shock, and he was sent flying backward, colliding violently with the hall’s wall.

“Boom…” The second-floor hall echoed with thunderous sounds as Luo Tian collided into it.

“Impossible!” Sun Mengru, Diao Dezhu, and others stared in disbelief at Luo Tian, who was now embedded into the hall. They spoke in shock.

Chapter 1596: The Battle Against Tongtian

Everyone was terrified, watching the battered Luo Tian. They hadn’t expected him to be so helpless after just one move. How terrifying must this old man be, and how变态 (abnormal) his physique?

“Is he truly the Tongtian Lord!” Diao Dezhu and others thought, fighting dragons while observing Luo Tian.

“Terrifying physique. I’ve never been so helpless in a physical clash!” Luo Tian muttered, quickly disappearing from the wall.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian vanished, a streak of light struck the spot he had just occupied.

“Boy, you’re quite good. You’ve withstood my attack and are still lively!” The old man smiled, then stretched his body, emitting a series of cracks.

“I won’t back down!” Luo Tian’s face bore determination. He then crouched, activating the King-Defying Martial Art. Two great techniques were instantly imbued into his physique, boosting his speed to its limit. He appeared before the old man in an instant, swinging a golden fist toward him.

“Fast, but not enough!” The old man sneered. His withered hand shot out, colliding with Luo Tian’s fist.

“Crack…” Thunderous sound returned. Luo Tian was sent flying again, but this time the old man also took a few steps back, his thin face showing surprise.

“Hmph, your physique is truly strong! These two great techniques are also unparalleled!” The old man spoke softly. He then kicked the ground, rushing toward Luo Tian again.

“Don’t you fear me!” Luo Tian roared. Though he had fallen behind in the clash, he now knew that against this terrifying old man, he wasn’t without a chance.

Though the old man was powerful, his blood had withered to its peak. Though he had absorbed Run Hongyu’s blood, it was still weak.

The thunderous sound filled the entire hall, even overshadowing the other battles.

With the King-Defying Martial Art activated, Luo Tian was also terrifying. Combined with his strong physique and two unparalleled techniques, he could now face even a true Pro-Epoch Lord without fear.

Yet the old man was also terrifying. He clashed with Luo Tian repeatedly, not falling behind but causing Luo Tian to spit blood each time.

However, the old man was also filled with waves of shock. He knew the origin of this physique—it was truly the body of the Tongtian Lord.

Long ago, the Tongtian Lord had sealed his body within it for unknown reasons. Though it was sealed, all the blood essence had been drained from it, leaving it like a corpse, sleeping day and night within the coffin.

This old man was a fragment of true spirit born within this body, combined with the auspicious land of Nine Dragon Phoenix Formation. Over time, it had gained consciousness but remained suppressed by the coffin.

Yet the auspicious land of Nine Dragon Phoenix Formation was not something ordinary people could withstand. The extremes led to the creation of a great evil spirit, gradually merging with this withered Epoch Lord’s body.

Until Luo Tian and the others opened the coffin, the spirit sensed Run Hongyu’s presence. It knew this was its chance—Run Hongyu’s blood essence was of the same origin as the Tongtian Lord. If it absorbed all of Run Hongyu’s blood, this corpse-like body would awaken.

Luo Tian’s ability to clash with the Epoch Lord’s body was enough to shock the old man. Though it wasn’t at its peak, it was still something no ordinary person could move.

Continuously clashing, Luo Tian gradually understood the old man’s strength. His physique was变态 (abnormal) to an extreme, but his body lacked Epoch Power. His blood had withered, relying solely on this unparalleled physique to clash against him. Though his strength was slightly stronger than a typical Pro-Epoch Lord, he would still be suppressed by figures like Gu Tian and Dongbo Xin.

Yet even so, Luo Tian wasn’t doing well. Though he had discovered the path to becoming a Pro-Epoch Lord, he hadn’t fully entered it yet. His cultivation was still at the peak of Epoch.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound sent Luo Tian flying again, his body riddled with cracks. Blood spewed from him, and he felt his internal organs had shifted. Clearly, the brief clash had left him with serious injuries.

“Martial Arts!” As he retreated, Luo Tian didn’t continue clashing. He knew if they kept fighting like this, even his physique would not withstand it. This was his body; others might not survive a single punch from the old man.

As he retreated, Luo Tian’s hands formed seals. A golden vortex formed behind him as he retreated, and the Golden Intercepting Seal descended from the hall’s ceiling toward the old man.

“This is what martial arts look like. Once I fully awaken and cultivate Epoch Power, I can also perform it!” The old man smiled, observing the overwhelming martial arts. He then struck a single punch.

In an instant, the golden seal collided with the old man’s fist. A violent wave of energy surged outward.

The golden seal was shattered by the old man’s punch, causing everyone’s faces to change.

“This old fool is too abnormal!” Diao Dezhu and others trembled. Luo Tian’s martial arts could now even make a Pro-Epoch Lord cautious, but the old man had shattered it with his body.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Map…” Luo Tian continued to unleash martial arts, but all were shattered by the old man’s single punch.

“Boy, it’s useless. In front of absolute strength, just submit and die!” The old man smiled, walking toward Luo Tian. This was his first battle; he wanted to play with Luo Tian until he was desperate.

“Old fool, do you think I fear you!” Luo Tian glared at the old man’s smug expression and cursed under his breath. He waved his hand, and the Yin Fish flew from his hands again, rushing toward the old man.

An overwhelming aura rose from the Yin Fish. It then surged with power, like a dark cloud, rushing toward the old man.

“This is an Epoch Treasure? But it’s still too weak,” the old man muttered. He also struck a punch, hitting the Yin Fish.

“Boom…” The Yin Fish flew back. The old man’s hands finally showed cracks, causing Luo Tian to feel speechless.

“Boy, Epoch Lords can all withstand Epoch Treasures. This old man’s physique isn’t at the peak of an Epoch Lord, but I can only injure it this much. Unless you use your secret weapon—the bones you absorbed earlier, which could suppress the old man. Will you use it?” The Yin Fish’s spirit voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Wait a little longer!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He then waved his hands, generating an overwhelming aura. The Brahma Heavenly Attack Technique was continuously manifested, and a golden palace flew from his hands, radiating the aura of an Epoch Treasure. It rushed toward the old man with a killing intent.

“This…” The old man’s face showed surprise for the first time. He felt a strong threat from this ancient palace.

“Come…” The old man then reached out, grabbing the emerald coffin. It emitted a series of thunderous sounds as it was lifted high above his head.

“Boom…” In an instant, the golden palace collided with the emerald coffin. The power spread out, and waves of divine laws surged outward, destroying everything in their path.

“Boom… boom… boom…” As the destructive waves spread, the nine bone dragons fighting with Sun Mengru and others were shattered. They turned into fragments of bones, scattered across the ground.

Sun Mengru and others had already默契 (in harmony) positioned themselves before Run Hongyu, who was seated in meditation. They were protected by the black and white qi from the Yin-Yang Twin Fish.

Standing within the Yin-Yang Twin Fish’s barrier, Diao Dezhu and others stared at the emerald coffin with expressions of disbelief.

“Why is this coffin so powerful? It can even withstand the manifested Epoch Treasure!” They spoke in shock.

“Cough… cough…” Coughing sounds rose from beneath the coffin. The emerald coffin fell to the ground with a heavy thud, and the old man’s somewhat battered figure appeared in people's sight.
