The next instant, a heavy breathing sound echoed through the black space, as if some ancient and mighty beast had awakened from slumber. Black flames flickered within the skull, shimmering with brilliance, while golden light radiated from the bones of a peak era cultivator, illuminating the entire black space.

The space seemed to undergo a profound transformation. Darkness vanished, and the peak era bones glowed like a blazing sun, painfully piercing Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's eyes.

"Recognizable aura... who are you? Could it be that the master has awakened me?" a deep voice echoed in the bright space.

As the space was illuminated, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan finally discerned the surrounding illusion. Their faces bore expressions of shock, their hearts filled with relief.

In their vision, the entire space was littered with golden bones. The weakest were remains of early era masters, each suspended in the void. Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan silently marveled at their luck; if they had encountered all of them, they would never have reached this spirit relic.

"Old friend, do you remember me?" Jiang Nanxuan smiled slightly and addressed the peak era bones.

A hum resonated. In an instant, the peak era bones stood upright like a human, flesh and blood forming. Before Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's eyes, the bones coalesced into an old man's form—though a mere illusion. Through his Purple Demon Eye, Luo Tian saw the old man remained bones.

"You are Tian Huan," the elder stood up, his body emitting a series of crackling sounds as if he hadn't moved in ages. Black flames danced, his gaze fixed on Jiang Nanxuan.

"Yes, I am Tian Huan! I never expected we'd meet again!" Jiang Nanxuan's fusion with the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower granted him memories of it.

"Why are you here?" The elder directly questioned Jiang Nanxuan's purpose, then his gaze fell on Luo Tian, a faint frown forming in his ethereal expression.

"You brought an outsider here!" The elder's face bore displeasure, raising a hand to unleash a powerful refining force toward Luo Tian.

"A hum..."无形的符文 came from all directions, sweeping toward Luo Tian. His face instantly changed.

Luo Tian had already struggled against the immense refining force; now, with the spirit relic itself attacking him, the power was unimaginable.

Jiang Nanxuan, who had previously ignored Luo Tian's presence, now felt his difference. His face changed abruptly: "Yin Yu, this is my friend!"

Jiang Nanxuan spoke, his hands forming seals. The aura of the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower surged forth, black and white qi swirling around him, forming a divine and demon flower that shielded Luo Tian.

"Hmph! Don't think I don't know, you've merged with a human. You're no longer the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower!" The spirit relic elder's face bore coldness, his voice sharp.

"I'll say it plainly. I brought him here to make you submit to him, letting Luo Tian become the master of the Divine and Demon Dao Map. You'll agree whether you want to or not!" Jiang Nanxuan's gaze held authority, his aura radiating power.

"Xian Huan, have you forgotten the master? I Yin Yu have only one master—Divine and Demon Master. Others are not worthy of my loyalty!" The elder's face bore pride, especially when mentioning the Divine and Demon Master, his eyes burning with fervor.

"What about Yang Yu? Why did my friend see someone able to command it? Don't think I don't know, the two of you are from the same source. He was subdued; you know that!" Jiang Nanxuan's face bore mockery, his gaze disdainful toward the elder.

"Yang Yu's choices are his own. Don't think I'm giving you face; I'll let you leave now, and this matter won't be mentioned again!" The elder spoke, his hand pointing. A door opened in space before Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's eyes, a scorching heat radiating from it—connecting to the fire sea.

"Shall we leave?" Jiang Nanxuan transmitted mentally to Luo Tian, awaiting his decision. He knew he was the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower; with Yin Yu's past relationship with it, Yin Yu would never submit to him.

"Since we've come this far, how can we not strive?" Luo Tian replied, his gaze fixed on the elder, speaking softly again.

"Respected elder, I only hope you can help Nine Domains through this great calamity. I promise I'll never disgrace the Divine and Demon Master!" Luo Tian's face bore reverence as he bowed to the elder.

"What calamity of Nine Domains is this to me? Regardless of any great disaster, I am immortal and indestructible. As for others' lives—what does it matter? Who hasn't died? Even the master, a peak power, never escaped longevity. How could others?" The elder shook his head lightly, his gaze cold.

"Respected elder, be direct. What trial do you have? If I can accomplish it, I'll never refuse!" Luo Tian had no patience for the elder's words. He knew that such a peak treasure would have formidable trials, so he asked directly. If it failed, he planned to unleash Dongbo Xin to subdue it.

"Ah, young man. I can give you a chance, but this opportunity is ten deaths to one life. If you pass it, I'll acknowledge you as my master. If not, sorry—your death is certain. Are you willing?" The elder's gaze was deep as he addressed Luo Tian.

Seeing the elder's cold gaze, Luo Tian knew if he said he would die, it was true. The elder had lived so long; his indifference toward life was profound.

"Don't agree! I know Yin Yu. He's cold and heartless. If not for me being the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower, we two might already be corpses among these bones."

"Try!" Luo Tian nodded slightly, ignoring Jiang Nanxuan's warning. His gaze remained respectful toward the elder.

"You're sure?" The elder, seeing Luo Tian's confident respect, let out a scoff and asked again.

Luo Tian said nothing. He stepped from Jiang Nanxuan's side, approaching the elder—clearly indicating his intent.

"Good!" The elder's face showed a hint of admiration. He waved his hand, and the space trembled. The white bones suspended in space seemed to be summoned, gathering toward the elder.

"One... ten..." Thousands of crystalline, golden bones piled up like a mountain before Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's eyes.

A powerful pressure nearly made Luo Tian kneel. If not for his strong body and will, he would have already collapsed.

Among these bones, the weakest were half-step era remains. The strongest reached peak era. This overwhelming pressure made resistance impossible.

The elder ignored Luo Tian's shock and trembling, raising his hand again. The mountain of bones emitted a series of thunderous roars. Under Jiang Nanxuan and the elder's shock, they scattered and reassembled into a hundred-zhang-wide cage-like space.

"Enter," the elder smiled slightly, addressing Luo Tian. "If you can exit this cage, your talent is unparalleled, and your combat power is unmatched. I'll submit to you!"

"Are you kidding me? These are peak era bones! One could kill Luo Tian, let alone so many. Yin Yu, don't push too hard; if you provoke me, I'll overturn this space!" Jiang Nanxuan's face darkened as he scolded the elder.

"My words still hold. This is your last chance to choose—leave!" The elder ignored Jiang Nanxuan's words. Though he was the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower, in this space, the elder was invincible.

"Fine. I accept!" Luo Tian nodded, his eyes resolute. He didn't believe he couldn't handle dead bones.

Hearing Luo Tian's confirmation, the elder nodded. He grabbed Luo Tian and hurled him into the golden bone cage.

"Bzzz..." In an instant, Luo Tian appeared inside the bone cage. His face immediately changed as a powerful suppressing force enveloped him, causing his body to crack.

Before he could react, golden bones radiated divine power toward Luo Tian. His face darkened further.

Luo Tian felt as if a star had been placed on his back, moving slowly. He watched the divine power attack him. Without time to think, he summoned his幽冥鬼步 (Hellscape Ghost Step), dodging the devastating waves.

"Good footwork, but this is just the beginning. The real fun's ahead!" The elder smiled slightly and pointed his finger, causing a hum to spread.

At the moment the elder's finger touched, the bone cage changed again. Thousands of bones glowed with light, as if preparing a terrifying strike.

Chapter 1155: The Three Thousand Dao融入One Body

Within the golden space, a golden bone-crafted cage hovered in Jiang Nanxuan and Yin Yu's view. The cage radiated immense divine power, with golden divine beams continuously striking Luo Tian.

Luo Tian bore massive pressure. His steps on the Hellscape Ghost Step were like a dancer walking on a blade's edge—each step was life or death. A single hit from the divine beams would result in severe injury.

"Yin Yu, your actions are too harsh. If Luo Tian suffers any harm, I'll ensure you no longer exist!" Jiang Nanxuan's face darkened as he threatened the spirit relic Yin Yu.

"You can try now!" Yin Yu's elder scoffed, ignoring Jiang Nanxuan's words entirely.

"How to break through?" Luo Tian panted, dodging the divine beams. His remaining holy power was nearly depleted. If it ran out, his speed would drop another level—perhaps he'd be hit.

"Can't. I need to think of a way!" Luo Tian grabbed a handful of pills, swallowed them, and restored his holy power.

At the same time, he thought rapidly. He knew there must be a chance within this bone cage; if not, the spirit relic Yin Yu wouldn't have gone to such lengths. He would've simply destroyed them.

"Your talent is unparalleled, your combat power unmatched!" Luo Tian's mind echoed the spirit relic's words. His eyes suddenly glowed with golden light.

He moved, his mind forming a bold idea. No longer just dodging, he surged forward like lightning, breaking through the divine net and reaching the bone cage's edge. He unleashed Dao Sealing Demon Fist, Fan Tian Attack, and One Force to Shatter All Methods. The three great arts surged forth with thunderous power. Luo Tian, like a golden-cast warrior god, his fist radiated overwhelming might, striking the bones before him.

"Right! This cage can only be broken by unparalleled combat power. There's no other way!" The spirit relic smiled slightly, speaking softly.

"You think I don't know? This cage's bones are half-step era remains. With Luo Tian's strength, he could break them. But you've fused these bones with Dao laws, making each part equally strong. Unless Luo Tian reaches half-step era, escaping is impossible!" Jiang Nanxuan's eyes flickered. He watched Luo Tian unleashing a punch.

"Boom..." The space trembled as Luo Tian's full power punch collided with the radiant bone cage, producing a heavy thunderous sound.

"Bzzz..." The next moment, the bone cage glowed again. It remained unmoved while Luo Tian was repelled, spitting blood.

"Impossible!" Luo Tian's mind shook. He thought he'd found the weakest spot, but the entire cage was fused and unbreakable.

"Zhi..." As Luo Tian flew backward, his body lost balance. A divine law struck him, piercing his arm.

"Luo Tian, it's impossible! There's no chance! This cage is beyond your current strength. Unless you reach half-step era, breaking it is impossible!" Jiang Nanxuan shouted.

"Good combat power. But to be my master, it's not enough. Without the combat strength of the Divine and Demon Master in his prime, how can he be my Dao Map's master?" The spirit relic Yin Yu's eyes bore disdain.

"Kid, I'll give you one last chance. Considering your talent and young age, you're already powerful. Perhaps in the future, you'll attain the era's master. Now choose to give up; I'll make an exception and spare your life!" The spirit relic Yin Yu addressed Luo Tian, who was still moving through the divine beams.

"Give up? I Luo Tian have never given up! Even if it's a relic of the era, I won't back down!" Luo Tian spoke, his voice resolute. However, he was pierced three more times, golden holy blood with轮回 (reincarnation) power spilling.

"Severely wounded!" At this point, Luo Tian had four wounds. His body bore divine patterns from the heavy pressure. One wound was on his arm, one on his thigh. The other two were fatal—one on his abdomen nearly cutting him in half, another on his chest nearly piercing his heart.

Jiang Nanxuan watched Luo Tian's persistence despite the wounds. His face finally darkened, his hands forming seals. Black and white qi surrounded him, swirling around his white robe.

"Bzzz..." The hum returned. An ancient altar appeared in the golden space, summoned by Jiang Nanxuan. Dongbo Xin's towering figure sat on it, black seal patterns entwined around him like a corpse. Yet his pressure was terrifying.

"If Luo Tian dies, you'll die too!" Jiang Nanxuan looked at the spirit relic Yin Yu, his eyes threatening. His hand held a purple ancient zither, ready to awaken Dongbo Xin.

"This is... Divine and Demon Cultivation!" The spirit relic's face trembled, his gaze filled with shock at the altar's Dongbo Xin. Yet he shook his head, sighing.

"Regrettable. Overambitious. His talent is good, but without the Divine and Demon Canon of the master to assist, it's almost impossible. Reaching this level is already difficult!"

"If he had solely cultivated as a divine or demon, perhaps he could attain the era's master. His achievements are limitless. Unfortunately, he destroyed himself—day as a god, night as a demon, living madly on the world!" The spirit relic Yin Yu's discerning eyes immediately saw Dongbo Xin's problem. His gaze bore pity, his voice sighing.

"If Luo Tian dies, I'll awaken him, making you regret it!" Jiang Nanxuan threatened. His gaze held tension as he watched Luo Tian still moving within the ancient cage.

Dongbo Xin was undoubtedly powerful. Though his Divine and Demon Cultivation made him a madman, his late era strength was there. Even the spirit relic Yin Yu, residing in peak era bones, would hesitate to confront Dongbo Xin.

"Sky Huan, are you threatening me?" The spirit relic Yin Yu's face darkened. Though he knew Jiang Nanxuan wasn't the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower, he still habitually called him Sky Huan.

"Threaten you? What if we didn't have the resources?" Jiang Nanxuan's voice was calm, but beneath it lay endless killing intent. "I'll say it again: if he dies, you die! Don't doubt my words; otherwise, you'll regret it!"

"I finally understand why the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower chose to fuse with you!" The spirit relic Yin Yu shook his head, a faint smile on his face.

"Did you think I truly wanted this kid's life?" The spirit relic's voice echoed in Jiang Nanxuan's mind, making him stunned.

"Reincarnation Body is powerful. But currently, he hasn't fully awakened his potential. Otherwise, with the Reincarnation Body's talent, it wouldn't be much worse than our master!"

"What conditions most easily awaken potential? Obviously, life and death. I pretended to want to kill him to awaken his potential!" The spirit relic Yin Yu's voice made Jiang Nanxuan stunned.

"Did you trick us all along?" Jiang Nanxuan's face changed, his gaze still skeptical toward the spirit relic.

The Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower's memory of the spirit relic Yin Yu was cold, indifferent to life. Even his own life was unimportant. After living so long, the Tian Huan Divine and Demon Flower chose to fuse with Jiang Nanxuan. Both were immortal beings, living so long they'd become lonely.

"Of course. You have to play it convincingly, right? After so many years of imprisonment, I was almost bored. I just wanted a good master. Reincarnation Body is the top of nine bodies, naturally in my consideration!" Yin Yu continuously transmitted to Jiang Nanxuan, easing his mind slightly. Yet he didn't retrieve Dongbo Xin. After living countless years, this old entity's mind was like a demon—trustworthiness was uncertain.

While they spoke, Luo Tian was struck by two more divine laws. Blood spewed, his face pale to the extreme. His gaze was even hazy.

"Can't continue like this!" He mentally shouted, watching the devastating divine beams. His eyes turned purple, feeling his body grow heavier.

"Dao's essence! This is Dao Law!" Luo Tian opened his Purple Demon Eye, seeing through the phenomenon to grasp the essence. He saw the Dao's essence within the divine beams.

"Understanding Dao!" Luo Tian thought, his eyes slowly closing. His body emitted a serene aura, quickly entering the state of unity with heaven and man.

"Did you see? Did you see? This is entering the state of unity with heaven and man after being pushed to life or death!" The spirit relic Yin Yu's face showed a hint of excitement, transmitting mentally to Jiang Nanxuan.

"What's so strange about that? This kid just needs a slight adjustment to enter the state of unity with heaven and man!" Jiang Nanxuan watched Luo Tian entering the state, treating it as a normal event.

"What?" The spirit relic Yin Yu's phantom mouth twitched. He hadn't expected that ordinary people dream of entering the state of unity with heaven and man, but Luo Tian made it seem as simple as eating or drinking.

Chapter 1156: First Attack

Within the golden space, the golden bone cage stood in the vast space. Divine power radiated, with golden divine beams continuously striking Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes were closed. After entering the state of unity with heaven and man, he was unusually serene. He began to comprehend the divine laws within the beams. At first, he dodged constantly, but as time passed, he was struck repeatedly, his body spewing golden blood.

Jiang Nanxuan's gaze was serious as he watched Luo Tian within the bone cage. Though he was battered and weak, his body was wrapped in divine laws, integrating into Luo Tian's body.

As time passed, the number of wounds on Luo Tian increased. He seemed to be on the brink of death, blood flowing down and dripping onto the golden bone cage.

"Boom..." Finally, under Jiang Nanxuan's tense gaze, Luo Tian was completely destroyed by the divine laws. His blood and bones appeared in Jiang Nanxuan's view, with dense divine power enveloping his entire body, melting Luo Tian's blood and bones.

"Yin Yu, is this what you called a life-or-death crisis?" Jiang Nanxuan's face darkened, as if mad. He strummed his purple ancient zither.

The music was vast, like a surging sea. It represented Jiang Nanxuan's anger, sweeping toward Dongbo Xin.

"Wait a moment. He hasn't died yet. He's understanding Dao, using divine laws to destroy himself completely and comprehend the Dao!" The spirit relic Yin Yu's face also showed tension. His eyes fixed on Luo Tian, now reduced to blood and bones.

"Right now, immediately let me open this bone cage. Otherwise, don't blame me for being unkind!" Jiang Nanxuan didn't stop strumming the zither, his eyes fixed on the spirit relic Yin Yu, threatening.

"Breathing sound..." Black and white qi radiated from Dongbo Xin on the altar. Black chains scattered, black and white qi swirling in his nostrils.

"You're crazy!" The elder saw Dongbo Xin beginning to awaken. He jumped high, shouting at Jiang Nanxuan.

"Release Luo Tian's blood and flesh. Don't interfere with his rebirth!" Jiang Nanxuan stared intently at the spirit relic Yin Yu, speaking again.

The Taiyin and Taishang (Dark and Light) shone. Dongbo Xin slowly opened his eyes. One eye like a demon moon rising, the other like a blazing sun. A violent aura radiated from his body.

"Roar..." His long hair flew, Dongbo Xin roared into the sky. His gaze fell on Jiang Nanxuan and the spirit relic, his towering body slowly standing.

"Crack... crack..." Black seal chains broke one after another as Dongbo Xin stood up, transforming into a long dragon circling around him.

"You're crazy! Stop now. I'll open it for you!" The spirit relic Yin Yu saw Jiang Nanxuan actually wanted to release Dongbo Xin. He finally couldn't bear it, his heart shaking as he flew toward the bone cage.

"Good intentions turned into bad!" Yin Yu's face showed impatience. He approached the bone cage.

Jiang Nanxuan, seeing the spirit relic flying toward the bone cage, stopped his zither. The music ceased. Dongbo Xin also stood still, his two eyes slowly closing again, sitting on the altar.

"I'll open it for you right now. But don't regret it!" The spirit relic Yin Yu looked at the already seated Dongbo Xin, calming himself. His phantom hands formed golden seal dragons, wrapping the entire bone cage.

"Bzzz..." Just as the spirit relic Yin Yu's seals touched the bone cage, Luo Tian's blood and bones within it changed. They emitted a series of hums, divine light flashing with an immortal aura.

"Still!" Seeing Luo Tian's blood and bones change, the spirit relic smiled slightly. He pointed his finger, fixing the golden seal dragons in space. His gaze fell on the bone cage.

"Hmm?" Jiang Nanxuan's eyebrows slightly furrowed. He also felt Luo Tian's change, his heart a little ashamed. His usual calmness had made him so impulsive today. It was because Luo Tian was too important to the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Fire Domain. If Luo Tian fell, both domains' people would collapse instantly.

Light spread everywhere. Divine power radiated. Under Jiang Nanxuan and the spirit relic Yin Yu's expectant gaze, Luo Tian's blood and bones, constantly melted by divine laws, emitted a series of hums. The melting force instantly stopped.

Blood and bones intertwined, emitting powerful divine power. They continuously fused and merged. Even the blood that had dripped from Luo Tian's wounds returned from the void, merging into his already forming human-like body.

Thunderous sounds echoed. Waves of sound rose. Luo Tian's figure gradually appeared in Jiang Nanxuan and the spirit relic Yin Yu's view. His body emitted thunderous sounds.

The divine beams that had nearly killed Luo Tian now stirred no reaction from him.

"Three Thousand Dao!" The spirit relic's heart trembled, speaking in disbelief at the sight of Luo Tian.

Jiang Nanxuan's face also bore shock. He knew Luo Tian had understood divine power, but he hadn't expected that in this bone cage, Luo Tian had fully mastered the Three Thousand Dao. That was a half-step era strength—only those who had stepped into the era could comprehend it fully.

Under their gaze, Luo Tian bathed in those divine beams. He was reborn before their eyes.

"Three Thousand Dao!" Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, feeling every part of his body contained the essence of Dao. It was perfect, each movement naturally harmonious with the rhythm.

"Stronger!" Jiang Nanxuan's face bore joy, speaking softly. He could feel that the current Luo Tian was even more terrifying than before. Even he felt a sense of incomprehensibility.

After rebirth, Luo Tian's cultivation had not declined but instead become stronger. The divine power constantly striking his body felt like a stream merging into the sea, stars falling into an immense black hole—causing no ripples at all.

"Dao Sealing Demon!" Luo Tian's gaze bore fierce battle intent. He flew forward, appearing at the bone cage's edge. His seemingly ordinary punch was nearly a Dao itself. Combined with Fan Tian Attack and One Force to Shatter All Methods, even the spirit relic Yin Yu felt a sense of shock.

"Crack..." Thunder roared. Under Jiang Nanxuan and the spirit relic's astonished gaze, the seemingly solid bone cage trembled under Luo Tian's punch. It emitted a strong vibration.

"Powerful! These bones contain several peak era remains. Though only a few, most of their divine power was evenly distributed by half-step era bones. Their strength is much weaker now, but they are comparable to a half-step era or even early era master's body! Yet this kid's punch made it tremble!" The spirit relic Yin Yu spoke softly.

"How does Luo Tian compare to the master, the Divine and Demon Master?" Jiang Nanxuan sighed longingly. Seeing such a powerful Luo Tian, he felt joy for him.

"Though there are some shortcomings, this attack power is even more terrifying than the master in his prime! You could say he's the strongest attacker I've encountered in my long existence!" The spirit relic Yin Yu's phantom form showed a hint of admiration, his voice filled with disbelief.

"Boom..." As they discussed, Luo Tian had already thrown a second punch. It struck the golden bones.

The sound of Dao spread, divine lightning surged on Luo Tian's body. A crackling sound echoed. The seemingly indestructible bones cracked under Luo Tian's second punch.

"Break!" Luo Tian roared, throwing his third punch. It felt like it could shatter stars and move the sun and moon. The bone cage, now with fine cracks, was struck.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed. A violent wave swept over Luo Tian's body. His white robe fluttered, making him appear like a legendary warrior god. The hundred-zhang-sized bone cage shattered with a thunderous sound, turning into pieces of bones floating around Luo Tian.

"Broken!" Jiang Nanxuan whispered lowly, retrieving Dongbo Xin and the vast altar. He stood there.

"Seems like he passed," the spirit relic's heart was also shaken, but his face showed indifference. He pointed his finger, sending the scattered bones away. After all, some were peak era remains. If accidentally hit Luo Tian, Jiang Nanxuan would definitely seek revenge.

"Thank you, respected elder. Has the candidate passed the test?" Luo Tian clenched his fists and approached the spirit relic, bowing to him.

"Seems so. You're second only to my previous master. If it's about attack power, the master Divine and Demon Master in his saint peak might not have been as terrifying as you! You are the strongest attacker I've encountered in my long existence!" The spirit relic Yin Yu spoke, his voice clearly showing admiration for Luo Tian.

The Divine and Demon Dao Map was a peak era treasure crafted by the Divine and Demon Master. The master's talent was astonishing, one of the earliest era masters. To receive such admiration from the spirit relic Yin Yu, it showed how terrifying Luo Tian's attack power was.

"Respected elder, can you help me?" Luo Tian naturally knew his current attack power was terrifying. But this level of strength wasn't enough to deal with the Demon Domain's crisis. He needed stronger震慑 (intimidation), the Yin Yu Eye of the Divine and Demon Dao Map.

"I keep my word. From now on, you are my Yin Yu's master. Until I find the complete Divine and Demon Dao Map, I'll serve you. Of course, if you find the Divine and Demon Dao Map and Yang Yu, allowing us to fully merge into a peak era treasure, the power of the Divine and Demon Dao Map would be as strong as I don't need to say!" The spirit relic's eyes showed a hint of smile. He pointed his finger, and black qi surged from his body.

Chapter 1157: Fire Sea Spirit

Within the golden space, the spirit relic Yin Yu's face bore solemnity. He pointed his finger, and black qi spread from the elder's body. It gradually condensed into a black moon, imprinting itself on Luo Tian's forehead.

"Don't resist!" The spirit relic Yin Yu addressed Luo Tian, his voice unprecedentedly solemn. This made Luo Tian's mind tremble.

"Bzzz..." The black moon imprinted itself on Luo Tian's forehead, disappearing from Jiang Nanxuan's view.

"Boom..." In the next moment, Luo Tian's body produced a series of thunderous sounds. An invisible pull formed between him and the spirit relic Yin Yu.

At the moment the connection was established, Luo Tian's face showed a hint of joy. He felt he had completely mastered this spirit relic Yin Yu, familiar with the entire space. The whole space was now presented in Luo Tian's perception.

"You are now my master. I hope you become stronger, not disgracing the name of my previous master, the Divine and Demon Master!" The spirit relic Yin Yu bowed to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian quickly stood up, approaching the spirit relic Yin Yu. He reached out to help him up but only touched a pile of cold white bones.

"You can take me with you after leaving. When you want to kill enemies, just activate me. Those below the era level can't withstand it. Even those in early era with no special means can't endure my multiple attacks!" The spirit relic Yin Yu's face bore a hint of confidence as he addressed Luo Tian. At the same time, a black door appeared in space, scorching heat again hitting Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan.

"Respected elder, I take my leave!" Luo Tian bowed to the spirit relic Yin Yu. Though he was now his master, Luo Tian still maintained the etiquette of a junior.

"Sorry, I misunderstood you earlier!" Jiang Nanxuan's face bore a smile as he bowed to the spirit relic Yin Yu.

"Hmph... go away!" The spirit relic Yin Yu's face bore impatience as he addressed Jiang Nanxuan. Clearly, he found Jiang Nanxuan annoying now.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian smiled, seeing the spirit relic Yin Yu's gaze on Jiang Nanxuan. He knew it was just a momentary anger.

"Ah!" Jiang Nanxuan nodded, following Luo Tian into the black door. They disappeared from the spirit relic Yin Yu's view.

"Haha, I've really struck gold! A Reincarnation Body! If it doesn't die early, it's certain to become an era master!" The spirit relic elder, losing his dignity, shouted in the golden space.

"Bzzz..." Transmission power emerged. Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan reappeared in the fire sea. However, a vacuum still surrounded the black tortoise shell, even more so than beside the ancient palace. The black flames feared it.

"Indeed, one thing overcomes another!" Luo Tian's face bore a sigh. He waved his hand, retrieving the ancient palace and standing under the black tortoise shell with Jiang Nanxuan.

The ancient palace was too noticeable. If not for the black flames' strength, Luo Tian wouldn't have summoned it. Now with Yin Yu, he naturally chose Yin Yu as the best option. Compared to the ancient palace, Yin Yu was too ordinary. Even if thrown on the ground, an unperceptive person might think it was just a stone.

"What's next? Can we leave?" Luo Tian smiled slightly, addressing Jiang Nanxuan.

"Yes. If my calculations are correct, after passing through these black flames, we can exit this fire sea illusion!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly. He was clearly excited. The fire sea contained infinite dangers. This flame might just be a corner. If something else happened, they might truly lose their lives.

With Yin Yu hovering above their heads, they walked through the black flames as if strolling under ordinary stars. The black flames felt the tortoise shell's immense absorption power and fled in fear, creating vacuum patches wherever they went.

Guided by Jiang Nanxuan, they carefully walked for nearly an hour. Finally, they exited the black flames. Before them was a starry sky, escaping the scorching heat. They both sighed in relief.

But the next moment, their faces changed again. They looked at each other, seeing shock in each other's eyes.

"This is where? Not the Four Sacred Star Domains or Fire Domain!" They were confused, as if they had entered an unfamiliar star domain—unlike any they'd seen before.

"Bzzz..." Next, a ball of seven-color flames appeared in their view. This made Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's hearts tense instantly.
