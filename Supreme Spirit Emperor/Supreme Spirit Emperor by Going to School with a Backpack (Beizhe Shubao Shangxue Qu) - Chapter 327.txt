“Of course I am willing to sacrifice my life for the Divine Emperor!” Luo Tian said, his voice tinged with insincerity as he bowed respectfully. This caused Fu Xingxuan’s lips to curl slightly in amusement.

“You dare!” The royal prodigies’ faces darkened instantly, their gazes flickering with disdain toward Luo Tian. How arrogant this subordinate was—daring to ignore them so openly.

“This should be secure now,” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang exchanged a glance behind Fu Xingxuan. They knew Luo Tian’s strength; even in the latter era of the Age, he had endured for so long against a formidable opponent.

Moreover, Fu Xingyue had fought Luo Tian before and understood his power. To challenge him was akin to a fool’s dream.

“Haha, great commander, fight with all your might! We support you!” The Star Moon Guards’ eyes gleamed with excitement. To them, Luo Tian was a godlike figure—unbeatable.

The other Star Moon Celestials also regarded Luo Tian with unwavering confidence. They had heard of his deeds in the Thunder Palace and believed he was no less than these royal prodigies.

“Very well, since you are so eager, we shall not disappoint,” Fu Wenbin smiled gently. He extended his hand, and a verdant arena materialized in the sky. A powerful barrier erupted from his palm, enveloping the stage.

“Go on, boy. If you truly defeat these prodigies, your matter may yet be considered,” Fu Wenbin addressed Luo Tian, his tone laced with encouragement.

Luo Tian knew Fu Wenbin referred to whether he could be with Fu Xingxuan. He inwardly snorted, “I don’t even want to!”

Though he despised the thought, Luo Tian’s face bore an expression of gratitude as he leapt onto the stage.

“Star Moon Guard Commander, Fu Mengchen, please teach me!” Luo Tian stood on the stage, his gaze flickering with battlelust as he faced the royal prodigies.

“Since we’re leaving anyway, helping Fu Xingxuan’s annoying girl isn’t a problem. I can also see what these royal prodigies are truly capable of,” Luo Tian mused silently.

“Arrogant commander!” As Luo Tian muttered, a golden light flashed. A youth cloaked in radiant gold stood before him.

“Ninth son of the Golden Crow’s Ten Princes—Jin Ziming!” Someone immediately recognized the youth.

“Half-epoch?” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, sighing inwardly at the arrogance of the Golden Crow Clan.

Chapter 1334: The Eyes of All Clans

“Arrogant fool!” Luo Tian stood on the stage, gazing at Jin Ziming’s golden aura. He shook his head lightly.

As Luo Tian assessed Jin Ziming, the latter scrutinized him with a hint of solemnity. His purpose in stepping onto the stage was to test Luo Tian’s strength for his elder brothers.

Jin Ziming knew he wasn’t a match for Luo Tian in the early epoch, so he didn’t greet him. His body radiated a surge of golden energy, and waves of scorching heat filled the barrier.

“Golden Crow Clan’s innate flame—comparable to celestial fire! I’ve heard that when perfected, even an epoch-end master could be incinerated. The royal clan who offended the Golden Crow was burned to death by this flame,” Luo Tian’s mind echoed Fu Xingyue’s voice.

“Roar…” Jin Ziming unleashed a torrent of golden flame, instantly engulfing Luo Tian and sealing all escape routes.

Luo Tian remained calm. Facing the terrifying heat, his expression bore no fear. Two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies radiated a white glow, enveloping him as he charged into the golden inferno.

“Boom…” In an instant, Luo Tian’s body pierced through the golden sea and appeared before Jin Ziming. A smile flickered on his face as he swung a fist, striking Jin Ziming’s chest.

Jin Ziming spat blood, his face etched with shock. His body was sent flying backward and crashed onto the ground.

“Simple, swift. Even a half-epoch prodigy cannot match an early epoch master,” the crowd murmured, marveling at Luo Tian’s calm demeanor.

The other royal prodigies’ faces darkened. Jin Ziming’s swift defeat unsettled them; even they would not subdue him with a single move.

Thus, the royal prodigies regarded Luo Tian for the first time with genuine respect. They exchanged glances, Qi Ziyang’s face darkened as he transformed into a black whirlwind and leapt onto the stage.

“Unexpectedly, you have some skill,” Qi Ziyang glared at Luo Tian with a cold tone. He hadn’t forgotten the two humiliations in Star Moon Celestial City.

“Perfect, I’ll crush you. It should serve as a deterrent for those arrogant ones,” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with amusement, ignoring Qi Ziyang as he surveyed the remaining prodigies.

Luo Tian longed to shout, “Come on, all of you! I’ll fight ten!” But he restrained his impulse and turned to face Qi Ziyang.

“You dare?” Hearing Luo Tian’s disregard, Qi Ziyang snorted and transformed into a black blur, charging toward Luo Tian. His fists roared with dark energy.

“You’re not my match,” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered coldly. He raised his fist and struck Qi Ziyang.

“Boom…” The collision sent a thunderous echo. In an instant, Qi Ziyang’s body was hurled backward, colliding with the barrier. His face bore disbelief.

Luo Tian had taken only two steps back, his expression surprised. He mused that Qi Ziyang truly possessed skill; he knew his current strength—early epoch masters were effortlessly crushed.

“Another punch, felling Qi Ziyang!” The crowd gasped in awe. None expected Luo Tian to repel Qi Ziyang.

Qi Ziyang, a prodigy of the Kirin Clan with an innate body of ink-black Kirin, was unmatched in physical combat. Yet this lean commander had done it.

“Great Commander, mighty!” The Star Moon Celestials erupted in cheers, their eyes burning with fervor as they watched Luo Tian.

Though the Star Moon Celestials knew Luo Tian’s strength, this was their first glimpse of his might. Repelling a prodigy on the verge of attaining enlightenment—this feat elevated him to par with Fu Xingyue, if not beyond.

Qi Ziyang’s face darkened. Staring at Luo Tian’s lingering smile, he couldn’t believe he had been repelled by a mere commander. He leapt forward again, this time unleashing his full power. Black lightning crackled around him, converging into his fist as he slammed it toward Luo Tian.

“Dao Sealing Demon,” Luo Tian murmured. His two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies surged with epoch power and Dao energy, clashing against Qi Ziyang once more.

The result remained unchanged. The only difference was Luo Tian took three steps back, while Qi Ziyang’s body was hurled backward with a crackling sound.

“His flesh is truly terrifying—epoch power is several times stronger than ordinary,” the old Golden Crow frowned, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Haha! Our great commander is invincible!” The Star Moon Celestials erupted in deafening cheers, shouting as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“I don’t believe it!” Qi Ziyang’s face contorted with rage. To be defeated by a mere commander felt like an insult. He roared into the sky.

“Roar…” The earth trembled as dark energy radiated from Qi Ziyang. His body swelled, transforming into a monstrous beast over ten zhang tall—dragon head, deer antlers, lion eyes, tiger back, bear waist, snake scales, and horse hooves. It was the Kirin Clan’s form. Yet Qi Ziyang’s body was jet-black, glistening like ink. Most striking was the prominent black horn atop his head.

“Celestial Ink Kirin! Indeed, a Celestial Ink Kirin!” The crowd was stunned. Their eyes locked onto the ink-black beast, a legendary king of the Kirin Clan.

“Indeed formidable,” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He stood unmoving, gazing at Qi Ziyang’s beast form with unyielding eyes.

The ink-black Kirin roared, darkening the sky. Thunderbolts materialized above and crashed onto Qi Ziyang.

“Sizzle…” Yet the thunder failed to harm Qi Ziyang, absorbed entirely by his horn.

“Stomp…” Qi Ziyang growled, lifting a thick leg. Lightning crackled around it as he stomped downward.

“Dao Sealing Demon, Fana’s Attack!” Luo Tian remained cold. Seeing Qi Ziyang’s killing intent, he swung a fist—this time employing Fana’s Attack.

“Woo…” A pristine white fist pierced the void, colliding with Qi Ziyang again.

The thunderous clash echoed. The result remained unchanged: Luo Tian took a few steps back with a smile, while Qi Ziyang’s massive body was hurled backward again.

“Crack…” The sturdy barrier shattered under Qi Ziyang’s colossal form, and he fell off the stage.

“Too变态! Why do I feel the great commander still has reserves!” The crowd fell silent, watching Luo Tian panting heavily.

“This kid isn’t human!” Fu Xingyue’s face bore a bitter smile. The thought of competing against Luo Tian filled her with helplessness.

“Roar…” As Qi Ziyang’s body had barely fallen halfway, it instantly returned to the stage. His black form bore countless cracks, and he spat out dark energy.

“Die!” Qi Ziyang’s eyes burned with killing intent. A world-destroying black lightning shot from his horn.

“Boom…” The overwhelming pressure instantly enveloped Luo Tian, causing his smiling face to finally change. He took two steps back, tensing up as he chanted seals.

“Divine King Nine Heaven Diagram!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a massive diagram erupted from him like a blazing sun. It clashed with the world-destroying black lightning.

“Useless! This lightning is infused with the Dao’s power from nine heavens. Its strength surpasses even your epoch trials. I’ll see what you use to block it!” Qi Ziyang sneered, his ultimate technique. Even an epoch-middle master would fear this lightning.

“Result should be clear now!” Qi Rongxiu smiled, gazing at the stage. He knew the lightning’s power.

“Too early to say!” Fu Tianqing snorted, clearly confident in Luo Tian.

“Crack…” The thunderous clash echoed. The Divine King Nine Heaven Diagram collided with the black lightning.

After three breaths, the diagram shattered into a surge of epoch power, spreading outward.

Chapter 1335: Penetrating the Stage

The black lightning surged forward, shattering the Divine King Nine Heaven Diagram and engulfing Luo Tian. The crowd gasped in unison.

“Indeed, the Celestial Ink Kirin’s true strength. This Dao lightning elevates him above many early epoch masters!” The Golden Crow elder, Jin Ziyang, mused as he watched Qi Ziyang.

“Elder, how many chances do you think you have against this Qi Ziyang?” Hearing Jin Ziyang’s words, the other eight Golden Crow brothers turned their gaze to him.

“Seventy percent,” Jin Ziyang smiled, his eyes confident as he gazed at Qi Ziyang.

Unbeknownst to them, Jin Ziyang had once fought Qi Ziyang. At that time, he had crushed him effortlessly. However, Qi Ziyang hadn’t awakened his Celestial Ink Kirin bloodline then—his current strength was incomparable.

Hearing Jin Ziyang’s words, the nine Golden Crow brothers smiled. They fully trusted his confidence.

“Die!” Qi Ziyang, unwilling to grant Luo Tian a chance, bore a sinister expression. Black lightning crackled from his horn, each carrying overwhelming power—no space for Luo Tian to escape.

A black lightning prison formed, crushing toward Luo Tian. The crowd’s faces bore shock.

“This is the Celestial Ink Kirin’s true strength! Mastering Dao lightning, blessed by heaven!” The Star Moon Celestials fell silent, gazing at Luo Tian engulfed in black lightning.

“I believe in you!” Fu Xingxuan sat on the purple crystal throne, her fingers slowly clenching into a fist.

“He’s trying to kill the great commander!” The Star Moon Celestials erupted in loud cries, their gazes on Qi Ziyang sensing his killing intent.

Yet the Star Moon Celestials could only shout. The black lightning had fully enveloped Luo Tian, obscuring his form.

“Great Guardian!” Fu Tianba spoke softly, gazing at Fu Wenbin. His eyes bore worry. Though he knew Luo Tian was strong, even the black lightning made him uneasy.

“Nothing to worry about. Trust,” Fu Wenbin smiled, his eyes gleaming with light. His hand slightly lifted, ready to intervene at any moment.

“Crack…” Thunderbolts kept falling for a full quarter-hour, the stage trembling constantly.

“Not even scraps left!” Hun Tiance’s face bore a smile as he watched the black lightning gradually subside.

“Even if not dead, he’ll be severely injured,” Jin Ziyang mused. He didn’t believe Luo Tian would emerge unscathed, nor fully dead—after all, Luo Tian’s flesh had shown terrifying strength.

“Woo…” As the black lightning was about to dissipate, radiant light emerged. A supreme path of light burst from the smoke, appearing before Qi Ziyang.

“Want to kill me?” Luo Tian panted, his eyes deep. He struck Qi Ziyang’s head with a fist.

“What happened!” The crowd was stunned. Luo Tian had appeared too quickly for anyone except epoch-end masters to notice.

A crackling sound echoed, like a thunderclap. The crowd’s eyes returned to the stage, filled with disbelief.

“Not even a scratch!” Everyone couldn’t believe their eyes. They watched Luo Tian, though battered, still radiating blood qi.

“Ah…” Qi Ziyang’s voice echoed with a scream. His massive body was hurled backward, and the barrier shattered again.

“Such a weak thing! You still electrocute me! I’ve seen countless epoch trials! Want to suppress me with Dao?” Luo Tian didn’t leave Qi Ziyang but stood atop his head, gripping the prominent black horn with a fierce expression.

“What is he doing? Why did he grab Qi Ziyang’s horn!” Qi Rongxiu’s face changed instantly. His eyes bore a bad premonition.

“He won’t be…?” Everyone watched Luo Tian, guessing his intent.

“Get out!” Qi Ziyang shouted. Black lightning crackled around his horn, dancing on Luo Tian’s body.

Yet Luo Tian seemed unaffected. His face bore a fierce expression as he clutched the black horn tightly.

“Come out!” Luo Tian’s arms bulged with veins. A wild wave of power blew through his torn robes.

“Puke…” Blood spurted, a column of blood shooting into the sky. The divine blood spilled onto Luo Tian.

“变态!” The crowd watched Luo Tian, their hearts aching. They hadn’t expected him to be so变态, enduring that terrifying lightning.

Even more shocking was this变态’s ability to yank out the Celestial Ink Kirin’s horn.

“Ah…” A pitiful scream echoed from Qi Ziyang. His massive body shrank rapidly under the crowd’s gaze.

“Stop!” Qi Rongxiu finally changed color, his eyes burning with killing intent. He barked at Luo Tian, a powerful pressure sweeping toward him.

“You stop!” Fu Tianqing snorted. He extended his hand, pressing down. The wild energy hadn’t reached Luo Tian before vanishing.

Luo Tian coldly spoke, “Want to kill me? Today, I’ll leave a mark!” Luo Tian didn’t intend to kill Qi Ziyang. He knew even if he could kill him, several epoch-end masters wouldn’t let him finish Qi Ziyang. Thus, he could only injure him.

With the black horn in hand, he twisted his wrist and drove it into Qi Ziyang’s head.

“Boom…” The massive body crashed onto the stage, sinking it three inches. At the same time, the black horn was embedded in Qi Ziyang’s head, pinning him to the ground. His dark body convulsed, black energy spewing from his head.

“Damn it!” Qi Rongxiu闪动 his body, instantly appearing before Qi Ziyang. His fingers danced, sealing the blood spilling from Qi Ziyang.

Meanwhile, Qi Ziyang’s body gradually returned to human form. A black horn, long and prominent, remained on his head, extending to the back of his skull—unusually terrifying.

“Rise!” Qi Rongxiu extended his hand, a powerful suction. The black horn slowly flew from Qi Ziyang’s head into Qi Rongxiu’s hand.

Qi Rongxiu stared at Luo Tian, his eyes burning with unhidden killing intent. Yet after seeing the three Star Moon Celestial Guardians seated nearby, his eyes darkened as he descended from the stage.

“Can’t even beat my dung-collecting commander. Want to marry me?” Fu Xingxuan’s face gleamed with a strange light, her voice laced with disdain.

“Exactly!” The Star Moon Celestials erupted in cheers. Their mocking laughter made Qi Ziyang’s face pale.

“This should震慑 many!” Luo Tian scanned the faces of Tu Feiyang, Hun Tiance, and Fan Jingyu, among others.

“I’ll go!”蛮魂’s body trembled. His eyes flashed with light. His battle spirit was ignited, excited by Luo Tian’s formidable flesh.

“Back!” However, the蛮族’s Sa Man scolded him. His battle spirit was instantly extinguished. He stood obediently.

Tu Feiyang and others exchanged glances, watching the still-dripping blood of Qi Ziyang. Their eyes bore contemplation.

Seeing Qi Ziyang’s state, they had no confidence in defeating Luo Tian. Instantly, no one chose to fight again.

“Haha! The great commander has single-handedly restrained these people from fighting!” The Star Moon Celestials’ faces bore excitement. Their eyes burned with fervor as they watched Luo Tian, who remained calm.

At this moment, Luo Tian was the center of attention. No one expected a mere commander of the Star Moon Celestials to restrain these royal prodigies from stepping onto the stage.

“Arrogant! I’ll go fight him!” Hearing the surrounding murmurs, Tu Feiyang snorted.

“Let me do it!” Hun Tiance was also provoked. His battle spirit ignited, preventing Tu Feiyang.

“I want to see what this commander is truly capable of!” Fan Jingyu’s wings spread open, his voice pure.

“You all stop. I’ll go first!” As the three prepared to move, a golden light appeared before them on the stage. His severe eyes scrutinized Luo Tian.

“Golden Crow’s eldest prince, Jin Ziyang!” Someone immediately spoke, their eyes filled with awe. The crowd erupted.

“This will be exciting!” People were thrilled, watching Luo Tian and Jin Ziyang face each other.

Jin Ziyang was renowned among the royal clans. People vaguely considered him the top genius of all clans. Luo Tian’s defeat of Qi Ziyang proved his strength. Witnessing their clash would ignite people's blood.

“Need to rest?” Jin Ziyang smiled, golden flames drifting from his body.

“No need for you,” Luo Tian changed into clean clothes. He clenched his fists, his battle spirit rising as he sensed a threat from Jin Ziyang.

Chapter 1336: Three-Feet Golden Crow

“Arrogant!” Jin Ziyang’s face darkened at Luo Tian’s words. His gaze toward Luo Tian turned colder.

“Indeed no need,” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, his expression indifferent. He had no injuries—only looked battered.

“Then let’s begin!” Jin Ziyang’s eyes were cold. His body radiated intense heat, golden flames swirling around him. The terrifying temperature burned the void. Jin Ziyang’s body seemed to twist.

Jin Ziyang pushed off the ground, vanishing instantly and appearing before Luo Tian. He extended his hand, a golden palm striking Luo Tian’s chest.

“Boom…” The clash echoed. In terms of flesh combat, Luo Tian had no fear. He swung a fist, clashing with Jin Ziyang.

After the clash, both retreated, colliding with the barrier. Luo Tian’s heart was solemn as he watched Jin Ziyang’s face gradually pale.

“Indeed, a person who gives me a strong threat. His flesh is only slightly inferior to mine!” Luo Tian mused. It had been a long time since he faced an equal opponent, and this excitement stirred his soul.

“Skillful!” Jin Ziyang’s eyes also bore solemnity. He knew Luo Tian’s flesh was strong, but he hadn’t expected to be matched.

“Even the eldest brother’s flesh couldn’t beat this commander?” Jin Ziyang’s nine brothers bore shock, gazing at Luo Tian, whose breath was steady.

As Jin Ziyang’s brothers, they knew his flesh was formidable. His bloodline was rich, and his flesh had been strengthened by innate flames for years—already surpassing peers.

“Again!” Jin Ziyang’s eyes flashed with light. Like Luo Tian, he was excited—finally finding an opponent to fight at full strength.

“Good!” Luo Tian laughed, his body moving. He rushed toward Jin Ziyang again, this time using all his strength. Two great techniques were infused into his fist as he struck Jin Ziyang.

“Golden Crow Sealing King Curse!” Seeing Luo Tian charge, Jin Ziyang murmured. Flames formed into a seal, etched onto Qi Ziyang’s forehead.

A wave of energy surged from Jin Ziyang. Next, a series of crackling sounds echoed in the crowd’s ears. Jin Ziyang’s body seemed forged from gold, moving forward without fear toward Luo Tian.

The thunderous clash echoed repeatedly. Jin Ziyang, enhanced by the Golden Crow Sealing King Curse, did not fall behind Luo Tian. They clashed repeatedly.

“Powerful! Truly powerful—matching Jin Ziyang to this extent!” Everyone held their breath, watching the two clash.

“Who is this commander? Why have I never seen him before? Star Moon Celestial intelligence has no record of him!”

“Indeed! Why have we never heard of such a person? His attacks seem unusually powerful—Jin Ziyang, even with the Golden Crow Sealing King Curse, couldn’t withstand it!” The crowd murmured as they watched the two gradually becoming battered.

“Let me investigate who this commander truly is!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes bore confusion. Why did Luo Tian’s attacks feel familiar?

“His previous martial arts—I’ve seen them somewhere before!” Tu Feiyang’s brow furrowed.

“I feel the same,” Fan Jingyu’s face bore confusion. He plucked a feather, and it vanished from his hand.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The thunderous clash echoed endlessly. As the crowd marveled, Luo Tian and Jin Ziyang’s battle reached its peak.

Luo Tian trembled. His fists struck Jin Ziyang repeatedly, each punch making Jin Ziyang’s face pale further.

Jin Ziyang did the same, striking while Luo Tian also spat blood. They appeared evenly matched.

“This is a battle between a human and a royal prodigy!” Fu Xingyue watched the two clash, her eyes filled with admiration. She alone knew Luo Tian’s true identity.

Yet when Fu Xingyue saw Tu Feiyang and Fan Jingyu’s confusion, her heart tightened.

“Suspected?” Fu Xingyue knew Tu Feiyang and Fan Jingyu, along with Man Hun, had previously fought Luo Tian. Though it had been a couple of years since then, their first defeat was unforgettable.

“Even without using Man Qi Tuo, the Divine King Nine Heaven Diagram alone is enough to reveal the issue. Plus that terrifying attack—few in this world could use it!” Fu Xingyue’s face was solemn as she transmitted to Luo Tian.

“Boom…” Luo Tian struck Jin Ziyang’s chest, then dodged his attack. He heard Fu Xingyue’s transmission and paused.

Indeed, he had many flaws. Though his Fana Attack and One-Force-Defying-All were manageable, the Divine King Nine Heaven Diagram was too conspicuous!

“Too careless!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He thought that if he didn’t use Man Qi Tuo, no one would recognize him. After all, there are so many martial arts in the world—who would remember a Divine King Nine Heaven Diagram?

“Never mind. If discovered, I’ll find a way to escape. At least now in the Star Moon Celestials, they won’t suspect too much!” Luo Tian mused as he took Jin Ziyang’s punch, his face pale.

“Warm-up is over!” Jin Ziyang pushed Luo Tian back with a punch, his eyes smiling. Golden flames enveloped him instantly, and his wounds quickly healed.

“Indeed, too long,” Luo Tian nodded. His two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies activated, and his injuries vanished.

“What? This battle was just a warm-up!” The crowd gasped. Even Tu Feiyang and others bore surprise, forgetting to ponder Luo Tian’s identity as they watched the battle with tense eyes.

“Golden Crow Burning Heaven!” A cawing sound echoed in the sky. Next, golden flames formed into fire crows, flying from Jin Ziyang’s hands toward Luo Tian.

“Ten… a hundred… ten thousand…” The fire crows erupted from Jin Ziyang’s hands, covering the sky. Their overwhelming heat made Luo Tian’s face grim.

“If only the Blue Crystal Glazed Fire were here!” Luo Tian sighed. His techniques were too restricted—this couldn’t be used, that couldn’t either.

“Withstand it!” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly. Epoch power radiated from his palms, and a great seal descended from the sky—his long-unused Open Heaven Seal.

The thunderous clash echoed. The golden seal pierced through the void, crushing the fire crows with a resounding boom.

“Enter Madness!” Luo Tian roared. He had used this state before against Tu Feiyang and others, so it was no problem now.

“Woo…” The golden seal scattered the fire crows. Yet its power gradually declined.

After a moment, the Open Heaven Seal was swallowed by the terrifying fire sea. The fire crows collided with Luo Tian.

“Can’t be hit by too many fire crows!” A fire crow vanished on Luo Tian, white smoke rising from his body. At the same time, he instantly disappeared from the spot and dashed forward.

“Your elder’s innate flame is so strong it can summon ten thousand fire crows!” The Golden Crow brothers marveled, gazing at Jin Ziming.

“You’re running away!” Jin Ziming smiled, waving his hand. The golden fire crows chased Luo Tian.

“Who said I’m running?” As he dashed, Luo Tian suddenly turned back. His black demon sword was raised, a smile on his face as he slashed.

The black blade’s light pierced the sky. It struck the fire crows, accompanied by cries of anguish. The golden fire crows were annihilated instantly.

“Second slash… Third slash…” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly. Two black blade lights flew out.

The terrifying Reverse Seven Demon Blades, infused with two great techniques, annihilated the formidable fire crows.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with a smile. He had long prepared the fifth slash, striking Jin Ziyang fiercely.

“Block it!” Sensing the technique’s power, Jin Ziyang’s body glowed with golden light. He soared upward, his body wrapped in golden flames. A clear sound echoed in the crowd’s ears.

Like a golden phoenix, but without a crown. The most striking feature was its third leg.

“Three-Feet Golden Crow—has it finally revealed its true form?” Luo Tian smiled, clenching his demon sword. At this moment, he had no other techniques—his strongest was the Reverse Seven Demon Blades.
