"Even Elder Chen has defected!" The serpent clan quickly learned of Chen Zhong's departure, and the murmurs spread like wildfire. In an instant, the entire serpent clan was thrown into chaos.

Luo Tian sat in the courtyard, with Yi Yitian and Tang Xinghuo standing by his side, their gazes sharp as they surveyed the surroundings. Even Liu Cheng, once trusted by Yi Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, now seemed unreliable.

Liu Cheng and another mid-stage Immortal King stood beside Fu Hong, watching as he swallowed a pill and meditated within the great cauldron.

Under the tense atmosphere of the serpent clan, three hours passed without either Luo Tian or Fu Hong opening their eyes.

As the serpent clan's tension mounted, a piercing eagle cry echoed through the sky of Ten Serpent Valley. The sound of breaking air filled the air, and dark figures appeared around the valley.

Black hawks circled above, their cold eyes scanning the serpent clan's people. A host of figures surrounded Ten Serpent Valley, encircling it completely.

"Skyhawk Clan has arrived!" Liu Cheng's eyes darkened as he gazed at Fu Hong, who still had his eyes closed. His face bore a bitter expression.

At the moment those figures appeared, Luo Tian opened his eyes. His aura remained weak as he slowly rose to his feet and approached the great cauldron where Fu Hong was.

"Go help the serpent clan hold off for a while. I will unblock Fu Elder's meridians!" Luo Tian ordered Yi Yitian and Tang Xinghuo.

"Fu Hong, come out and fight!" A commanding voice echoed from above. A figure clad in black stood there, his aura sweeping across nine heavens and ten earths.

As the voice faded, more eagle cries followed, shaking people's ears until they rang.

Hissing...

A line of serpents straightened their bodies, and serpent clan's masters appeared with solemn gazes, looking at the people outside Ten Serpent Valley.

"Eagle Force, he's truly recovered!" Liu Cheng's face was grim as he looked at the old man leading the Skyhawk Clan.

"What should we do? A late-stage Immortal King could easily crush our Ten Serpent Valley!" Another mid-stage Immortal King muttered, leaving Fu Hong's side. Now that Fu Hong was wounded, they couldn't help but step forward.

"Chen Zhong!" The serpent clan saw a middle-aged man standing behind Eagle Force, who was none other than the traitor Chen Zhong from their clan.

At this moment, Chen Zhong's face was still pale. The aftereffects of his escape hadn't fully recovered.

Yet now, Chen Zhong no longer looked like before. His face was twisted with hatred, his gaze fixed on the serpent clan people. He had completely lost his dignity and might even be more eager to kill the serpent clan than the Skyhawk Clan, for this was his disgrace.

Numerous serpent clan members gritted their teeth, glaring at Chen Zhong. If not for his betrayal, the Skyhawk Clan wouldn't have attacked Ten Serpent Valley so swiftly.

Three mid-stage Immortal Kings plus Chen Zhong made four mid-stage Immortal Kings. But the Ten Serpent Valley had only two, plus Yi Yitian, making three total. Who was stronger and who weaker was obvious.

"Capitulate or die!" Eagle Force's gaze fell upon the people of Ten Serpent Valley, his eyes showing a hint of amusement. But his cold voice made the serpent clan shudder.

"Never surrender!" The serpent clan cried out. They knew even if they surrendered, it wouldn't be a good fate. Two races were natural enemies; perhaps they would become food for the Skyhawks.

"Good, then kill them!" Eagle Force's eyes held no mercy. He extended a hand, and the heavens and earth trembled. A black claw burst forth, rushing toward Ten Serpent Valley. At the same time, numerous circling giant hawks dove down, attacking the serpent clan's people and serpents.

"Repel them!" Yi Yitian, Liu Cheng, and another mid-stage Immortal King looked at the black claw with grim expressions. They leapt into the air and met it head-on.

"Boom..." The next moment, a thunderous sound echoed through Ten Serpent Valley, like a lightning strike. Blood spewed from Yi Yitian and Liu Cheng's mouths as their bodies flew backward, eyes filled with shock.

"Even a mid-stage Immortal King can block me?" Eagle Force sneered, taking another step.

Plop... Plop... At the same time, black hawks descended from the sky, their sharp claws slicing through serpents. A large number of serpents were instantly cut into pieces.

"Kill them!" On another side, the Skyhawk Clan's people rushed toward the serpent clan.

"This is impossible to fight! The gap is too big!" Tang Xinghuo looked at the four mid-stage Immortal Kings charging toward them, his heart trembling.

The gap was too vast. A late-stage Immortal King could change so much, and three mid-stage Immortal Kings couldn't even withstand a late-stage Immortal King's steps.

"Fu Hong, come out!" Eagle Force smiled again, taking another step into Ten Serpent Valley. Wherever he stepped, a line of serpent clan members turned to mist.

In an instant, Ten Serpent Valley became bloodstained. No one could withstand Eagle Force; even Yi Yitian and the others couldn't resist.

Eagle Force's steps were slow, savoring this feeling of superiority as he walked toward the courtyard where Luo Tian and Fu Hong were.

"O Queen of the Serpent Clan, please awaken to save your people!" The serpent clan cried out continuously. The entire clan was being slaughtered by the Skyhawks.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's face darkened, feeling Eagle Force drawing closer. He watched as the medicinal liquid beside Fu Hong vanished and waved his hand, sending several silver needles flying from his hands. These weren't poison-tipped needles but were obtained by Luo Tian after the establishment of the Tianyuan Sect.

"Ahh..." The silver needles fell, and Luo Tian began to unblock Fu Hong's meridians. A painful cry came from Fu Hong.

"Master, hold on!" Luo Tian's lips twitched as the second needle fell.

"There's not enough time!" After three needles, unblocking meridians was a patient task. One had to wait for one meridian to recover and become smooth before moving on, so the time required was very long.

"Ah, there's a human here. That's the one who wants to save Fu Hong!" Eagle Force heard Fu Hong's painful cries and smiled, his gaze turning toward Luo Tian's courtyard.

Chapter 2447: The Silence of Heaven and Earth

Luo Tian's forehead was drenched in sweat, feeling Eagle Force drawing closer. The overwhelming pressure of a late-stage Immortal King was felt even from afar. Yi Yitian, Liu Cheng and three others fought desperately to block him, but each time Eagle Force simply lightly tapped them, sending them spitting blood.

"O Queen, save your people!" The cries of the serpent clan echoed continuously. Now the serpent clan placed all their hopes on the Queen.

"Praying to the Queen is useless. Even if your so-called Queen awakens, what then? I'm in need of a servant!" Eagle Force spoke, his eyes catching sight of the statue of the serpent queen standing there. His eyes flickered with interest.

"Whirr..." As if hearing Eagle Force's words, a wave of anger passed through the statue. The queen's closed eyes began to tremble slightly, and the stone skin started peeling off.

"Can't come out? Ha!" Eagle Force was overconfident, knowing the serpent queen needed decades to awaken. He laughed arrogantly.

"Indeed has some beauty," Eagle Force approached the statue, his eyes filled with lust as he gazed at the exquisite statue.

"Crash..." Stone pieces fell, and a wave of faint light radiated from the statue's eyes.

"Still pretending to be mighty?!" Eagle Force sneered, raising his hand and slapping the statue fiercely.

Among all in the serpent clan, Eagle Force feared no one more than the queen. After all, her legend was there, and they Skyhawks came from the depths of Buzhao Mountain, knowing some secrets.

A massive hand pressed down on heaven and earth like a black cloud, causing everyone's breath to stop.

"Don't!" The serpent clan cried out, their eyes filled with despair.

"Crack..." Just as the black hand was about to collide with the statue, a clear crackling sound echoed in people's ears. The stone skin peeled off, and two green glows shot out, instantly imprinting on Eagle Force's eyes. His body suddenly froze.

Two green eyes slowly opened, and the atmosphere of heaven and earth seemed to gather around them. An invisible wave spread from the eyes, sweeping across eight directions.

"Th-this..." Eagle Force's eyes showed disbelief. His hand was no longer under his control, as if assimilated, turning into a stone color.

Cold eyes slowly opened, and everyone's minds seemed to be enveloped by these eyes.

"You..." Eagle Force's eyes suddenly became terrified. He felt his body being invaded by an unknown force, and from hand to foot, he was no longer under control. He began to gradually turn into stone.

"Let me break free..." Eagle Force shouted, his first time feeling such fear. His late-stage Immortal King cultivation desperately circulated, trying to resist the petrification force but was helpless. He could only watch as his entire body, including his meridians, heart, dantian, and even blood, gradually turned to stone.

Not only that, the wave spread everywhere, turning everything into black and white.

Crack... Crack... The sound never ceased. The eagles in the sky, the blood on the ground—all turned like this.

Luo Tian was also shocked. However, this wave seemed to bypass him and Fu Hong. Everyone's eyes were filled with fervor as they looked at the statue that had opened its eyes.

This was their queen, an invincible force for countless years. The spiritual belief of the serpent clan, who had saved them several times.

All Skyhawk warriors turned into stone. Each one of them fell from the sky, shaking the earth.

"Saved!" The serpent clan cried out joyfully and began to kneel before the queen's statue.

The green eyes gradually dimmed, and the stone skin sank back down. The statue's eyes returned to their closed state.

"I can only trap them for half a day!" A weak voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears, silencing the joyous people.

"Half a day is enough!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He was confident that in half a day, he could complete Fu Hong's meridian unblocking.

But for the serpent clan, it was like a drop of water in a cart. Even if Fu Hong's cultivation recovered, the result wouldn't change much.

"Although it's only half a day, his strength will drop significantly. I can only do this much. You all take care of yourselves!" The queen's voice faded in everyone's ears, and she said no more.

"We should take this opportunity to weaken the Skyhawks' strength!" Yi Yitian spoke. Eagle Force and others had turned into stone, now was the perfect time to attack.

"Whirr..." The long sword emitted a humming sound, slicing into the stone statue of Eagle Force.

A clear sound rang out. Sparks flew everywhere. The next moment, Yi Yitian's body retreated, the powerful rebound almost made his sword fly out of his hand.

"It's no use. Petrified by the Queen's eyes, they are now stone. It's impossible for ordinary people to destroy them," Liu Cheng spoke softly.

"But our attacks can definitely hurt him, weakening him a bit!" Another mid-stage Immortal King spoke, his gaze on the stone pieces.

"Then weaken them!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and nine-color flames erupted from his hands, enveloping the entire statue of Eagle Force.

"Crack..." Tang Xinghuo approached a black stone piece and struck it with his palm. The eagle-shaped statue cracked.

"An Immortal King's strength can definitely harm a true immortal!" Liu Cheng spoke, his voice bitter. Their strength, even if they were truly immortals, would be much faster than now.

"Continue to attack as much as you can. Consume them!" Yi Yitian spoke, his long sword continuously slicing at Eagle Force's stone body.

Time after time, the sound of explosions echoed. One by one, the serpent clan people began to attack the petrified Skyhawks.

Luo Tian didn't care. His main problem now was to heal Fu Hong, so he could have a chance in battle. If Fu Hong wasn't healed, everything would be in vain.

"Thank you!" Fu Hong's face was filled with gratitude. Luo Tian and Yi Yitian could have chosen to leave, but they stayed to help the serpent clan fight against the Skyhawks.

Luo Tian's three people's strength was not to be underestimated. Without them, the serpent clan would have been even more helpless against the Skyhawks.

"Ahh..." But Fu Hong's response was Luo Tian's divine light. A needle fell, and Fu Hong's face twisted instantly. His body felt a pleasant sensation as his meridians began to slowly repair, pain and pleasure intertwined. This was Fu Hong's situation.

Fu Hong kept crying out, sweat pouring from his forehead. Luo Tian continuously worked to repair Fu Hong's meridians.

Time passed slowly. After two hours of screaming, Fu Hong's aura gradually rose, and his face no longer looked flushed.

"He's recovering!" The serpent clan's eyes were filled with surprise as they gazed at Fu Hong in the cauldron.

"Crack..." At this moment, the Skyhawks also began to gradually recover.

...

Dust swept up as Yi Yitian and others continuously attacked Eagle Force, after two long hours of attacks, they finally achieved results. Eagle Force's entire body was covered with cracks, and one arm was directly shattered by the final combined force.

"Can't take it anymore! I'm exhausted!" Yi Yitian and three others lay on the ground, unable to fight any longer. They took deep breaths.

"Whirr..." The world seemed to gradually regain its color, making the serpent clan tense.

"Everyone prepare. Attack them at the moment they recover. That's when they'll be weakest!" Liu Cheng shouted loudly.

"Yes..." The serpent clan immediately tensed, finding their targets and gathering their martial arts.

At the same time, two overwhelming auras rose. In the Nine Dragons Flame Cauldron, Fu Hong leapt up, his aura overwhelming.

Meanwhile, the Eagle Force petrified by the serpent queen also instantly returned to normal state, letting out a fierce scream.

At the moment Eagle Force recovered, his right arm immediately sprayed blood. His body also had many cracks, and the blood flowed through the cracks, wetting his black robe.

"Cough... Cough..." Eagle Force coughed blood. His eyes were filled with fear. The sensation of his previous perception still existed, but his body was no longer under his control. This feeling for a late-stage Immortal King was impossible.

"What happened?" At the same time, the Skyhawks also gradually recovered, their faces bewildered.

"Kill them!" The serpent clan's people met them with a wave of overwhelming attacks.

In an instant, the Ten Serpent Valley erupted in explosive sounds. Many Skyhawk warriors hadn't reacted yet and were immediately killed by the serpent clan.

"Retreat..." Eagle Force shouted, his body flying into the sky. The previous round of attacks had cost them many losses.

Eagle Force knew his current state was bad. Seeing Fu Hong's overwhelming aura, he felt he wasn't a match for Fu Hong.

"Eagle Force, I'll fight you!" Fu Hong shouted loudly. His entire body transformed into a black light and rushed toward Eagle Force.

"Chen Zhong!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He saw Chen Zhong being hit by the attack and flew up toward him.

"You!" Chen Zhong's face slightly changed. His face was pale. Previously, he had paid a price to escape, and now he had been hit again. Chen Zhong's current state was very poor.

But Luo Tian had taken advantage of Chen Zhong's poor condition. Although his own state wasn't good, he had also recovered a bit through pills while unblocking Fu Hong's meridians.

"Only you? Do you think you can kill me!" Chen Zhong stepped back, but as he did so, seeing Luo Tian was a late-stage Immortal King, his eyes showed coldness. He didn't retreat but rushed toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 2448: The Same Message

In Ten Serpent Valley, collisions kept echoing. A line of serpents coiled the winds. The Skyhawks had an advantage in the sky, but now they were falling from the sky, recovering at the same time and being attacked by the serpent clan, caught off guard.

"Boom..." A black hawk was immediately wrapped by a line of serpents, pulled down with great force and turned into a mass of blood.

Such situations were happening everywhere in Ten Serpent Valley. The two factions' warriors who could transform into human forms kept fighting, but this time the serpent clan had the upper hand.

...

Luo Tian's body moved like lightning, colliding with Chen Zhong. A thunderous sound rose from their collision. Both Luo Tian and Chen Zhong coughed blood, retreating dozens of feet.

"Strong!" Chen Zhong was surprised. He had never looked down on Luo Tian, even with his injuries. How could a late-stage Immortal King fight him?

"Can fight!" Luo Tian thought, feeling he could battle this Chen Zhong in his current state.

"Whirr..." Next moment, a black sword appeared in Luo Tian's hand. He let out another roar and rushed toward Chen Zhong.

Flying, Luo Tian's hands formed seals. The Law of the World was suddenly manifested, his massive body walking through the sky. Black sword light flew from Luo Tian's hands.

Chen Zhong's face was serious, watching Luo Tian's massive body. He extended his hand and grabbed a black flexible sword that fell into his hands. He swung it, transforming it into a black snake and met Luo Tian's descending sword.

This time there was no thunderous collision. Luo Tian felt his full-force attack hit a cotton-like object.

"Hiss..." The black snake, following the Dragon's Sword, appeared in front of Luo Tian. The sharp tip transformed into a snake head, as if finding its prey and rushing toward Luo Tian's heart.

"Softness overcomes hardness?" Luo Tian immediately understood. He clenched his fist and punched toward the cold snake head.

"Crack..." Next moment, six fists collided with the snake head. Blood spilled from Luo Tian's fist, and his body also retreated.

"Rage of the蛮神!" As he retreated, Luo Tian shook off the blood on his fist and raised his foot. The蛮七踏 was suddenly performed.

His foot pressed down, making Chen Zhong's face change. His hands continuously moved, a cold light凝聚 in his hand and flew toward Luo Tian's foot.

Fangs. A black fang, which Luo Tian had never seen before. He felt it was no simple technique.

"Boom..." In a flash, Luo Tian could only step down. The black fang directly pierced into his foot.

A sharp pain spread through Luo Tian's entire body, almost making him lose control of his divine form.

"Such a flesh body! That's why he dares to fight me!" Chen Zhong's eyes showed seriousness. He knew this technique, and a late-stage Immortal King would not be able to kill him, but Luo Tian was fine.

Chen Zhong raised his hands to the sky and met Luo Tian's pressing foot.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound spread. Luo Tian's body kept retreating, dust swirling. That pain still remained.

A numbness spread through Luo Tian's entire body, making his face slightly change. He wanted to take the second step but couldn't.

"The蛮七踏 was so easily countered!" Luo Tian's mind shook. He looked at Chen Zhong.

The only drawback of the蛮七踏 was its buildup. Once it reached the seventh step, it would be devastating. But now the first step was countered by Chen Zhong unintentionally, which surprised Luo Tian. After all, the蛮七踏 was a strong technique of Luo Tian's.

"Hisss..." As Luo Tian was astonished, a long snake stretched to the sky and opened its mouth, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Kid, how does my poison feel? Are you unable to move now?" Chen Zhong's face showed a cruel smile as he spoke.

"Okay!" Luo Tian sneered, and nine-color flames surged. That numbness instantly disappeared. At the same time, he punched toward the long snake, causing a thunderous sound.

"Step back... Step back..." Luo Tian's massive body retreated. At the same time, his hands quickly changed. His hand reached toward Chen Zhong's direction and pressed down. A black ghost claw extended from the sky, reaching for Chen Zhong.

Chen Zhong suddenly pointed his finger. His black finger collided with the hellish ghost claw, causing another thunderous sound.

"Domain!" After the collision, Chen Zhong's eyes suddenly brightened. A cold wave spread from his body. The waves seemed like many snakes moving, surrounding Luo Tian.

A domain of thousands of feet suddenly enveloped Luo Tian. A powerful pressure pressed down on him.

"A mid-stage Immortal King's domain, crushing a late-stage Immortal King. What do you have to fight me with?" Chen Zhong sneered, maintaining the domain power and pressing down on Luo Tian.

"But my domain is different from other late-stage Immortal Kings!" Luo Tian felt the powerful pressure. A wave of gray mist rose from his body, forming a group of wandering souls around him.

Hundred feet... Thousand feet... In an instant, the轮回 domain opened up to three thousand feet, constantly resisting Chen Zhong's domain.

Luo Tian's strength had increased significantly. Therefore, his domain also extended a long distance and its power had increased considerably.

"What is this domain? It's entirely composed of wandering souls!" Chen Zhong's eyes showed shock, watching the wandering souls constantly colliding with his domain and roaring.

As Chen Zhong was shocked, Luo Tian approached Chen Zhong's side with his sword and slashed again. Luo Tian chose close combat, which was his specialty.

Chen Zhong's face darkened as he continuously fought against Luo Tian. The black flexible sword kept moving.

Meanwhile, Eagle Force and Fu Hong kept fighting. They both vanished into the void. Fu Hong's aura was overwhelming, but Eagle Force's face was pale.

"Damn it!" Eagle Force's face was dark. The serpent queen had petrified him, and he had been attacked by Yi Yitian and others. He had lost an arm, which made him injured. The balance of power was now against him.

Fu Hong fought desperately against Eagle Force, giving him no chance. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If Eagle Force had time to catch his breath, he could definitely return.

"Retreat!" Eagle Force shouted and decided to pay the price to escape Ten Serpent Valley. As long as he rested for a while, they could definitely take back Ten Serpent Valley again.

Eagle Force spat blood. His black feathers suddenly turned red. A storm rose from the red wings, and one flap sent a blood-red blade flying out, cutting through space and sweeping across Fu Hong's body.

"Death won't let you escape!" Fu Hong roared, transforming into his true form—a golden giant snake. He opened his mouth and sucked in the blood-red blade.

"I want to leave, you can't stop me! Skyhawk Clan, retreat!" Eagle Force shouted loudly and didn't linger. He thundered toward the distance.

"Can't escape!" Fu Hong's golden body suddenly transformed into a golden lightning bolt, following Eagle Force and disappearing into the void.

"Retreat!" Hearing Eagle Force's words, the Skyhawks who had wanted to escape all burst forth, desperately flying toward the distance.

A group of figures turned into streaks of light and disappeared from Ten Serpent Valley. Even the mid-stage Immortal Kings fighting against them vanished from their positions.

"Can't stop!" Yi Yitian and others panted, watching their opponents leave. They had already expended a lot to destroy Eagle Force's arm and could only watch as the Skyhawks left.

Although the Skyhawks had escaped, they suffered heavy losses. This was the first time the serpent clan had gained an advantage in their confrontation.

However, one person didn't leave—Chen Zhong who fought against Luo Tian.

"Damn it!" Chen Zhong's face was pale. He had already used his blood escape technique once. It wasn't possible to use it again. If he could, he wouldn't be in such a state of being hit by Luo Tian and coughing blood.

Seeing the Skyhawks' warriors flying away, Chen Zhong's heart became anxious. He wanted to escape but Luo Tian gave him no chance.

"I'll help you!" A blade's light rose from behind Chen Zhong. Yi Yitian stood behind him.

"Chen Zhong, you traitor!" Liu Cheng shouted loudly. His eyes were blood-red. He swung his long sword toward Chen Zhong.

Another mid-stage Immortal King also started to fight, and they all attacked Chen Zhong with anger.

Boom... Boom... Boom... In just one attack, Chen Zhong was crushed under their feet. His body was directly smashed and lay on the ground.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, watching Chen Zhong who was barely alive. He knew Chen Zhong wouldn't survive.

"Kill, kill!" The serpent clan cried out loudly. They were all angry at Chen Zhong. If not for his betrayal, the serpent clan would definitely be in a different situation. If not for the queen's sudden awakening, they might have been destroyed.

For traitors, no place could tolerate them. In an instant, the enraged serpent clan dismembered Chen Zhong.

"Now we just have to wait for Fu Elder to defeat Eagle Force. If he does, the serpent clan will win. If not, the Skyhawks will definitely return!" Luo Tian muttered softly. A late-stage Immortal King's battle was beyond his ability to interfere.

"Whirr..." Just as Luo Tian's words fell, Liu Cheng's identity token rang.

"Come quickly and kill Eagle Force!" A desperate voice echoed in Liu Cheng's mind. Then there was no more sound.

"Can't contact! Only the fluctuation of the old ancestor's identity token can be felt!" Liu Cheng spoke, telling everyone the news from Fu Hong. His eyes were filled with seriousness.

"Then go quickly!" Luo Tian grabbed the token in his hand and closed his eyes to sense it. Black and white wings spread out.

Fu Hong dared to say this, so he must have had some confidence. In Buzhao Mountain, anything was possible.

"I'll go first. You follow!" Luo Tian flapped his black and white wings, disappearing from the spot.

When Luo Tian and others received Fu Hong's message, the Skyhawks' warriors who had escaped also received Eagle Force's message.

"What happened? Doesn't matter, go there first!" The Skyhawks' mid-stage Immortal King didn't think twice and flew toward the sensed direction.

Chapter 2449: Not Dead Yet

The black and white wings slowly trembled. Luo Tian's speed was extraordinary as he left the serpent clan's territory, searching for Fu Hong's position through the token.

Luo Tian didn't flap his wings as hard this time. After all, his previous speed was too fast and he couldn't control it.

Wind sounds echoed in Luo Tian's ears, and with thunderous noises, he got closer to the position sensed by the token.

Meanwhile, the Skyhawks' warriors also rushed toward the sensed location. There were three groups of people. Yi Yitian and Liu Cheng's group also left the serpent clan's territory, but their speed was slower than Luo Tian's.

"Such a fast speed! Just this speed alone could let him fight against mid-stage Immortal Kings!" Liu Cheng and another mid-stage Immortal King of the serpent clan looked with admiration. They were only a little behind, and Luo Tian was already out of sight.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian got closer to the sensed position, and the surrounding air gradually became dry, making Luo Tian cautious. However, his speed didn't decrease.

"Someone's here!" While flying, Luo Tian sensed someone rushing toward him. His mind was shocked.

"It's that kid!" A surprised voice echoed behind Luo Tian, which was the three mid-stage Immortal Kings from the Skyhawks.

"Three mid-stage Immortal Kings!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. He flapped his wings again, rushing toward the sensed position.

"What's going on? It's not to kill Eagle Force?" Luo Tian was confused. Fu Hong's transmission clearly showed confidence in defeating Eagle Force.

"Something's wrong... Perhaps both of them are injured and fighting each other. That means..." Luo Tian suddenly understood, his eyes flashing with light.

"I know! Hurry up. Don't let that kid get there first!" The three mid-stage Immortal Kings of the Skyhawks weren't stupid. They immediately realized why Eagle Force had sent them.

This was a race of speed. The three mid-stage Immortal Kings had previously used secret techniques to burn their cultivation, so they quickly caught up with Luo Tian.

Ten thousand feet... Thousand feet... In an instant, the three mid-stage Immortal Kings approached Luo Tian with thunderous momentum. They were only a thousand feet away.

"Flap again!" Luo Tian's mind trembled. The pressure from the three mid-stage Immortal Kings was still very big, so he chose to make his demon cloud wings flap again. At the same time, he activated the Yellow Spring Step. Luo Tian's speed increased dramatically, pulling away from the three Skyhawks.

"What a speed!" The three mid-stage Immortal Kings looked at Luo Tian, who could still accelerate. They were shocked and their faces turned grim.

"We've already used secret techniques, burning our cultivation. How can we catch up?" Their faces were bitter. However, they knew the importance of this mission. If they arrived after Luo Tian, there was a high chance that Eagle Force would be in danger.

"Keep burning. Burn our blood, we must surpass that kid!" The three quickly made a decision and started to burn their blood, chasing after Luo Tian.

The speed competition began. Luo Tian ran, and the three chased him. However, after that, the three were speechless. They burned their blood and caught up with Luo Tian, but Luo Tian seemed to have no limits, pulling away again.

Time passed slowly. The position of Fu Hong was getting closer. Luo Tian finally felt Fu Hong's location, only ten thousand feet away.

Ten thousand feet was too short for Luo Tian with his terrifying speed. After a moment, he suddenly stopped.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian looked into the distance, seeing that he was only one thousand feet away from Fu Hong.

Red earth radiated a scorching atmosphere, appearing in Luo Tian's vision. Ten thousand feet away, Fu Hong stood pale-faced, while Eagle Force was ten thousand feet away.

"Too hot!" Luo Tian frowned slightly. Ten thousand feet wasn't a problem for Luo Tian, but he saw Fu Hong and Eagle Force.

"What place is this?" Luo Tian's eyes showed shock. He immediately felt the unusualness of the red earth.

A sense of danger appeared in Luo Tian's mind, making him hesitate to enter. It seemed like a forbidden zone; entering would bring life-threatening danger.

Luo Tian saw a distant mountain that looked like a bird. He felt this bird-shaped mountain was familiar, as if he had seen it before.

"Don't come in. Stay outside the red circle and kill him. He can't withstand it now!" Fu Hong shouted, also seeing Luo Tian outside the red circle.

"Good!" Luo Tian didn't think twice. He waved his hands and launched a hellish ghost claw toward Eagle Force.

"Damn it!" Eagle Force's face showed resentment. He saw Fu Hong standing ten thousand feet away and turned his gaze toward the hellish ghost claw approaching him.

Previously, he and Fu Hong chased each other through space. But when they passed here, they were mysteriously suppressed by a force and fell here.

Even more terrifying was that after landing, they couldn't move. Their cultivation was also continuously extracted and weakened. After so long, both were almost completely weakened. They could no longer withstand an attack from a late-stage Immortal King.

In an instant, the black ghost claw descended and smashed onto Eagle Force's body.

"Boom..." Solidly, without any waste, the black ghost claw exploded on Eagle Force's body.

Eagle Force spat blood. This solid attack from the hellish ghost claw almost killed him. Even if he didn't die, Eagle Force's body was covered with cracks and he collapsed on the ground. Just a slight touch would make him completely perish.

"Another one!" Luo Tian's eyes showed excitement. He hadn't expected that defeating the half-dead Eagle Force would be so simple.

His hands continued to move. Luo Tian's hellish ghost claw was used again, with winds swirling and black ghost claws emerging from the vortex. This made Eagle Force's eyes show despair.

"Boom... Boom..." However, just as the black ghost claw was about to extend, a long black hair flew through the air with overwhelming momentum. It pierced toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's heart immediately contracted. He felt a strong sense of danger. If he didn't dodge, he would be pierced through the heart.

"Suppress!" Luo Tian made a decision. He raised one hand and pressed it into the void, directing the black ghost claw toward the fallen Eagle Force.

"Boom..."

"Pu..."

The black ghost claw exploded on Eagle Force's body. At the same time, Eagle Force's body was finally shattered by the black hand.
