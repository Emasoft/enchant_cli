Half a bell mark later, Luo Tian severed the Demon Tiger, and to his excitement, the Demon Tiger had also formed an Inner Dantian. Though not as powerful as the Demon Spider King's, it was still quite remarkable.

"Who knows how many ferocious beasts are in this forest? How many more Inner Dantians can I obtain?" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a hint of amusement. He took out his gourd, drank a mouthful of Yellow Spring Water, and the ultimate purification power spread throughout his body, purifying the demonic qi within him. At the same time, Luo Tian raised his hand and placed the Inner Dantians of the Demon Spider King and the Demon Tiger into the gourd, allowing the Yellow Spring Water to purify the demonic qi within them.

"I don't believe the Yellow Spring can't purify you!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the two Inner Dantians within the gourd.

Though the gourd appeared small, it concealed a vast realm. Its space was comparable to an item-storage ring. The Yellow Spring Water within it was abundant, and as the two Inner Dantians entered the water, they emitted thick black vapors, immediately purified by the Yellow Spring Water. Within the Dantians, a series of roaring sounds echoed.

"Wait for it. I believe it won't take long before they are completely purified. Once that happens, I'll fully refine these two Inner Dantians. My strength should improve significantly!"

"My current goal is to see if there are any other demons in this forest, obtain more Inner Dantians, and strive to kill them. Purifying the demonic qi within these Dantians will allow me to swiftly reach the peak of True Immortality." Luo Tian muttered quietly, then leapt into the air again, flying deeper into the forest.

Luo Tian killed demons while moving toward the heart of the forest. Though the beasts were few and powerful, he was still delighted. Each demon he killed provided an Inner Dantian worth years of cultivation.

At the same time, others were also killing demons in this forest. If one could see their positions, they would notice that everyone had been transported to different corners of this vast forest. Their direction of movement was toward the center.

However, unlike Luo Tian who could purify demonic qi from Dantians, these people merely killed the beasts in their path.

At the center of the forest stood a massive black altar, radiating dark glows. Gray seals flowed across it, and wisps of black qi emerged from the altar. If Luo Tian were here, he would realize that the demonic qi's density was the strongest in the entire forest.

This forest had been corrupted due to this demonic qi. The qi beneath the altar was even more terrifying. As the tremors echoed, vast amounts of demonic qi spilled from the altar, spreading outward.

Around the altar were numerous corrupted ferocious beasts, circling it and absorbing the emitted demonic qi. Their power gradually increased. Occasionally, some beasts would appear as if fully fed, leaving the altar's vicinity to wander into the forest. Others entered from the forest, absorbing the demonic qi.

If Luo Tian saw this scene, he would be horrified. These beasts were all formidable, with hundreds of them possessing True Immortal-level strength. Some were no weaker than the Demon Spider King he had previously encountered.

Yet Luo Tian and his companions remained unaware, moving toward this location based on instinct since it was where the tremors were strongest.

Time passed. Luo Tian had wandered through the forest for seven days. During these seven days, he killed numerous demons attacking him. He obtained about four or five Inner Dantians, which left him quite disappointed.

During these seven days, Luo Tian had not seen a single human. He sent messages via the token but received no replies.

However, as he ventured deeper into the forest, he noticed more ferocious beasts. Some approached from behind him, while others emerged from deeper within.

"What hidden secret does this forest hold?" Luo Tian mused internally, reaching for the black Inner Dantian he had just severed from a Demon Wolf.

"嗡……" As Luo Tian reached for the black Inner Dantian, waves of energy radiated toward it. The Dantian twisted slightly, as if being sucked into the void.

"Who!" Luo Tian shouted, his voice laced with anger. He activated the Yellow Spring Step and instantly appeared before the black Inner Dantian, grabbing it.

"Boom!" Luo Tian shattered the void and pulled the illusory Dantian into his hand. However, his hands were cut by the void currents, turning them entirely bloodied.

"Hand over the Dantian!" As Luo Tian grabbed the Dantian, a cold voice echoed in his ears. A figure appeared behind him, face expressionless, and a cold glint shot toward Luo Tian's back.

"Die!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, turning around and summoning the Dragon Abyss Sword from his back. It transformed into a black dragon, flying toward the figure.

"Crash..." A silver glint collided with Luo Tian's fist, instantly repelling it. Luo Tian also saw the attacker. The figure had silver skin, a hint of seductive expression, and wore silver robes. He held a silver long sword, his gaze coldly observing Luo Tian.

"Ah, it's you!" Luo Tian's face turned slightly cold. He recognized the attacker—Yin Wuyue, the disciple of the Silver Gold Pavilion in the Central Three Heavens. Yin Wuyue had also served in Bountiful Heaven City.

However, Luo Tian and Yin Wuyue hadn't had much interaction back then. Thus, his impression of Yin Wuyue wasn't deep. Yet he knew of this person's existence. He hadn't expected Yin Wuyue to come seeking trouble now.

"Luo Tian, it's been years since we last met. Back then, you truly shone in Bountiful Heaven City. Surviving the hell and returning alive proves your strength. However, I'm not the same as before. If you're wise, hand over that Dantian. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!" Yin Wuyue spoke coldly, his silver sword radiating icy glimmers.

"Only a small fish dares to trouble me. Who gave you the courage?"

"Want to steal my Dantian? See if you have the ability!" Luo Tian shouted, unwilling to waste words on Yin Wuyue. He leapt into the air toward Yin Wuyue, instantly standing before him and launching a punch.

"Your ability isn't great, but it's enough to deal with you!" Yin Wuyue remained calm. He knew Luo Tian was strong, but his impression of Luo Tian still lingered in Bountiful Heaven City. Since they were one level apart, Yin Wuyue had no fear of Luo Tian.

The silver long sword moved like a silver snake, piercing toward Luo Tian's fist. It collided with his fist.

In an instant, Luo Tian's fist met the silver sword tip. The silver blade bent at an astonishing arc, making Luo Tian frown slightly as if striking cotton.

"Die!" Yin Wuyue's face curled with a cold smile. He clapped his hands, and an immense True Immortal power surged from his hands into the silver sword.

"Crash..." The flexible silver sword emitted a tremendous rebound force, striking Luo Tian's fist.

Luo Tian felt a massive force pushing him back. His body shot forward like an arrow, colliding with several trees. His hand also bore a wound, deep enough to reveal bone.

"Haha! Master Yin Wuyue's Silver Snake Sword has truly reached its peak!" As Luo Tian steadied himself, a loud laugh echoed behind him. The laughter contained explosive sounds, as if arrows piercing Luo Tian's mind, making his face stiffen.

Chapter 2272: Truly Dead?()

A sense of crisis emerged behind Luo Tian, causing his face to slightly change. His voice was highly penetrating, as if containing a special method, extremely grating and making Luo Tian's head throb.

"Sound-based martial art?" Luo Tian sighed internally. The Dragon Abyss Sword rested on his back.

Fire erupted, a massive force pushed Luo Tian's body forward. His steps moved several paces ahead, and his back felt searing pain.

"Your reaction is quite fast!" A figure stood behind Luo Tian, a playful expression on his face. He held a three-foot-long blade, but it appeared transparent and very thin, like cicada wings.

"Qin Hefeng!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, recognizing the youth. Though they had some conflicts in Bountiful Heaven City, it wasn't significant.

"Hello, Luo Tian!" Qin Hefeng smiled lightly and greeted Luo Tian. In Bountiful Heaven City, Luo Tian had overshadowed them all. Qin Hefeng had been very不服气 at the time. Later, as Qin Hefeng's strength grew, Luo Tian disappeared.

"Hand over the Dantian. Considering we all served in Bountiful Heaven City, we'll let you go!" Qin Hefeng smiled lightly, his gaze on Luo Tian. If Luo Tian submitted today, his grudge would be resolved.

"What's the point of both of you coming?" Luo Tian sneered, his ghostly aura intense. He formed seals with his hands and summoned the Hellish Ghost Claws from the void, directing them toward Qin Hefeng.

"Die!" Qin Hefeng looked at the overwhelming ghost claws and wore a cold expression. He swung his thin cicada-wing blade toward the ghost claws.

At that moment, Luo Tian moved. His target wasn't Qin Hefeng but Yin Wuyue. Yin Wuyue's eyes narrowed slightly, recognizing Luo Tian's speed and taking him seriously.

"Boom..." The Hellish Ghost Claws descended, colliding with Qin Hefeng's blade energy and producing a deafening roar.

"Die!" Luo Tian sneered, the Dragon Abyss Sword in his hand slicing toward Yin Wuyue.

The silver sword twisted, forming a silver long snake. It clashed with the Dragon Abyss Sword. One rigid, one supple—within moments they collided.

"Have you not suffered enough? Let it rebound!" Yin Wuyue sneered, the silver sword bending again, as if becoming a bowstring.

"I've suffered enough, but I won't suffer twice!" Luo Tian sneered. His arms' veins bulged as a fierce aura radiated from his arms. He gripped the Dragon Abyss Sword and pressed downward.

A piercing friction sound echoed. Luo Tian glared, roaring continuously as he began to resist the rebound force.

"How is this possible!" Yin Wuyue's eyes widened, his face filled with disbelief. He gazed at the Dragon Abyss Sword approaching him.

Yin Wuyue felt his hands trembling violently. This had never happened before when he used the Yin Snake Sword.

"Crash..." Finally, Yin Wuyue couldn't withstand it. His palm cracked, and the silver sword flew from his hand.

"Crack..." The Dragon Abyss Sword sliced Yin Wuyue's shoulder, severing it. Blood erupted like a fountain from Yin Wuyue's shoulder.

"Ah..." Yin Wuyue screamed, his body falling and crashing into the ground.

Black smoke spread, a large pit appeared in Luo Tian's view. Yin Wuyue spat blood, his eyes filled with shock as he gazed at Luo Tian, never expecting him to be so strong.

"嗡……" As Luo Tian severely wounded Yin Wuyue, Qin Hefeng's attack also reached behind him. Two cicada blades slashed.

"Pluck, pluck..." Two blood trails appeared on Luo Tian's back. However, this injury was trivial for Luo Tian.

"Is that all you have? Want to steal from me? Two trash!" Luo Tian sneered, his black sword swinging again. It expanded violently and struck Qin Hefeng's body like swatting a fly, sending him crashing to the ground.

"Silver Snake Dance!" Seeing Qin Hefeng lying beside him, Yin Wuyue trembled. The Silver Snake Sword returned to his hand, emitting silver lightning that swept toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian wore disdain. His Dragon Abyss Sword erupted again, emitting a vast sword qi that swept toward the silver lightning. At the same time, Luo Tian leapt into the air and rushed into the sea of silver lightning cut by the Dragon Abyss Sword. He formed a seal with his hands, and the Heaven-Devil Dao Art was suddenly unleashed. His body radiated an extreme True Immortal aura.

Cracking sounds echoed constantly as the Dragon Abyss Sword cut through several lightning serpents. Luo Tian's entire body was bathed in thunder, a tingling sensation invading his whole body. To Luo Tian's surprise, the lightning contained sword qi.

"嗡……" Qin Hefeng also recovered. He opened his mouth and emitted a series of grating sounds, like cicada calls but extremely grating.

"Boom, boom, boom..." Trees were shattered under the sound waves. It also caused Luo Tian's head to throb, halting his movement toward them.

"Good opportunity!" Seeing Luo Tian stop, Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng both roared, rising to attack Luo Tian.

Silver light flashed. Yin Wuyue's speed was strange and beyond limits, instantly appearing before Luo Tian. If Luo Tian were in normal condition, he could react with the Yellow Spring Step. However, now that he was attacked by Qin Hefeng's strange sound-based martial art, his reaction was slightly delayed.

The invisible cicada-wing blade also emitted a series of humming sounds, slicing toward Luo Tian. Qin Hefeng wore a smile.

Luo Tian was still Luo Tian, experienced in countless battles. His combat experience and refined body allowed him to instinctively sense danger. Though their movements were fast, especially Yin Wuyue's speed was the fastest True Immortal peak Luo Tian had seen.

"嗡……" The long sword cut through the air. Luo Tian's body almost instinctively raised the Dragon Abyss Sword to block in front of him, and the silver lightning was extinguished on the Dragon Abyss Sword.

Two wounds appeared on Luo Tian's chest, his flesh torn open with blood gushing out.

"Only that!" Luo Tian stepped back, looking at Qin Hefeng and Yin Wuyue charging toward him again.

"Enough to deal with you!" Qin Hefeng sneered. The cicada-wing blade vibrated, emitting a series of humming sounds and forming heavy waves that swept toward Luo Tian.

"Go!" Luo Tian pointed his finger. The black Dragon Abyss Sword transformed into a black dragon from his hand, and the second level of sword art was suddenly unleashed. The Dragon Abyss Sword seemed to gain sentience, slicing toward Yin Wuyue.

At the same time, Luo Tian formed seals with his hands. 108 hand seals were imprinted on his body, the Hundred Ghost Seals.

108 whirlwinds appeared around Luo Tian's body. At the same time, the two cicada-wing blades reached his front. Luo Tian laughed with ghostly aura and grabbed Qin Hefeng's two wrists, directly seizing them. The two blades also pierced into Luo Tian's ribs.

"Die!" Luo Tian stared at Qin Hefeng, his voice cold. The shock in Qin Hefeng's eyes was evident.

Qin Hefeng stepped on the ground, trying to break free from Luo Tian. However, his wrists were tightly gripped by Luo Tian and could not escape. Worse still, Qin Hefeng felt a massive force tearing at him.

Luo Tian roared. His arms burst with powerful strength, his formidable physical power causing Qin Hefeng's body to crack. Then it expanded and was torn apart by Luo Tian's strength.

Blood mist scattered, the entire world seemed to freeze. Luo Tian was covered in blood, his body radiating a fierce aura. Especially the black qi around him made Luo Tian appear more ferocious than a ghost cultivator.

"You... you actually killed Qin Hefeng!" Yin Wuyue's body flew back, his eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian.

They had been competing but remained cautious, not daring to kill each other because of their high status. If something happened, it would be a major issue. However, Yin Wuyue hadn't expected Luo Tian to kill Qin Hefeng without hesitation.

"Now it's your turn!" Luo Tian, like a phantom, took advantage of Yin Wuyue's distraction and appeared before him. His black sword sliced downward.

"Pluck..." The Dragon Abyss Sword's sharp edge directly severed Yin Wuyue, who fell into a pool of blood. His eyes still held shock.

"It's really quite troublesome!" Luo Tian sighed lightly, gazing at the two corpses. He waited for them to regenerate.

"Hmm?" However, upon seeing their corpses, a bad premonition arose in Luo Tian's heart. His heart clenched violently.

Qin Hefeng had died a little earlier, but now he showed no signs of regeneration. This made Luo Tian feel uneasy.

"Can't be, big brother, don't play with me. Can't you regenerate here?" Luo Tian muttered internally, waiting for dozens of breaths. Neither Qin Hefeng nor Yin Wuyue showed any signs of regenerating.

"They really can't come back to life..." Luo Tian's heart suddenly panicked. The Heavenly Silkworm Valley was the second sect in the Central Three Heavens. Yin Wuyue's Silver Gold Pavilion didn't sound impressive, but its strength was enough to rank in the top twenty. Moreover, the Silver Gold Pavilion had financial resources.

The disciples of two sects were killed by Luo Tian. Even if the Star River Mansion wanted to calm things down, it would be difficult. Perhaps the sect masters of both sects would directly come to Bountiful Heaven Mountain.

"I've played too big," Luo Tian wiped the sweat from his forehead. However, he finally bit his lip and collected Qin Hefeng and Yin Wuyue's storage rings and weapons.

"Damn it, how could they play like this? I should have not killed them!" Luo Tian muttered, taking the Dantians from their storage rings and placing them into the gourd.

Chapter 2273: Pursuit()

Luo Tian looked at the two corpses with a helpless expression. He stood up, took their storage rings, and sighed longingly. After all, they were already dead. He didn't have anything to say. As for the trouble after leaving the Immortal Ruins, he didn't want to think about it.

Luo Tian stood up and didn't look at the contents of their storage rings. He walked toward the heart of the forest, while others were almost reaching the location of the altar at the center.

However, Luo Tian didn't notice that Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng's corpses were slowly disappearing, as if they had never existed.

"What is this?" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang looked surprised, concealing their forms. They watched the altar emitting demonic qi constantly. The two had just gathered, as they had previously come to the Demon Cave and thus arrived first.

"Previously, we entered and encountered a maze. But now it's a forest. Clearly, this place has changed. I killed over ten ferocious beasts and obtained some Dantians. If I could consume them, it would enhance our cultivation!" Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue didn't dare to act recklessly. They observed the ferocious beasts kneeling there, absorbing demonic qi and conversed.

"I'm about the same. However, these Dantians don't have much effect on us!" Fu Xingyue spoke softly. They waited quietly, waiting for Luo Tian and others to arrive.

Time passed. After an hour, figures rushed from all directions of the altar. Upon seeing the altar immediately, they concealed their forms and gazed at it with solemn expressions.

"Where is Luo Tian?" Though they weren't together, they noticed each other's presence. Observing, they found four people missing—Luo Tian, Yin Wuyue, Qin Hefeng, and a sect disciple.

No one moved first. They were all wary of each other, unsure what the other was thinking. Once they moved first, it would surely draw the attention of these corrupted ferocious beasts and possibly attack someone.

"Let's go meet Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng's friends!" Jiang Yuzhe transmitted to Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying. The three secretly moved toward Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's direction.

Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang also understood Jiang Yuzhe's intention, slowly moving toward the direction of Jiang Yuzhe and his three. After all, Jiang Yuzhe was a friend of Luo Tian, and Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang were relatively trustworthy.

"Where is Luo Tian?"

"You didn't meet him?" Fu Xingyue and Jiang Yuzhe transmitted simultaneously, first asking about Luo Tian's whereabouts. Only Luo Tian could allow the two groups to cooperate.

"Boom..." Just as the five of them had gathered, a breaking sound rose behind them. A streak of light tore through the void and transformed into a golden divine arrow, flying toward their direction.

"Who?" Fu Xingyue sneered and suddenly tilted his body, dodging the awe-inspiring arrow.

"Damn it!" However, a moment later, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's and Jiang Huantian's faces slightly changed.

"Roar..." A scream echoed. The golden divine arrow directly exploded a True Immortal early stage ferocious beast, blood splattering before the beasts. A Dantian fell alongside it.

As the arrow flew out, those ferocious beasts also rose. In an instant, the exploded beast was completely devoured by the corrupted beasts, leaving even the Dantian untouched.

At the same time, those ferocious beasts directed their gaze toward Fu Xingyue and others. They let out low growls, their black eyes flashing with ferocity.

"Who is it? Who's sabotaging us?" Fu Xingyue's face darkened. He looked at the places where Jiang Yuzhe's brothers were hiding, shouting.

"Roar..." However, Fu Xingyue received a thunderous roar. A black demon wolf rushed toward their direction like a bolt of lightning, and other beasts also roared, forming a black ocean. Each one radiated overwhelming demonic qi.

The brothers hiding in the shadows of Jiang Yuzhe frowned slightly. They couldn't tell who had sabotaged them.

"Let's run..." Jiang Yuzhe felt his scalp tingle. He held the golden Bountiful Heaven Sword, emitting golden light and slicing the black demon wolf into two. He also shouted to Fu Xingyue, as these beasts were too many for them to fight. If they fought hard, they might kill the beasts but would suffer heavy losses.

The five of them instantly flew into the air, rushing toward the forest's perimeter. The massive group of black beasts followed them.

As Jiang Yuzhe and his companions led the beasts away, the area around the gray altar became empty. A group of figures appeared, their faces filled with joy, standing outside the altar radiating intense demonic qi.

"Senior Seven, is that your people? One of those you brought was a disciple from the Divine Archery Sect!" Jiang Yuhong directed his gaze toward Jiang Yutian and spoke softly.

"Senior Six, are you going to lecture again? If it weren't for me, would you have had the chance to stand here?" Jiang Yutian sneered. Behind him was a youth with an expressionless face, carrying a wooden bow. The bow looked old but radiated ancient and mystical aura.

Jiang Yutian sneered, leading his four men into the air toward the gray altar.

Others also frowned slightly and took off, rushing toward the altar as if afraid of being late. This included Jiang Yuhong.

"Senior Six, why didn't you go help Ninth Brother instead of coming up here with us?" Jiang Yutian sneered. The demonic qi from the gray altar surged, and the four men's bodies emitted waves to resist the intense demonic qi.

Jiang Yuhong sneered and didn't respond. He observed the massive altar, finally noticing that one corner of it had surging black qi, clearly indicating that the demonic qi was coming from there.

"Here is the entrance!" Jiang Yuanshan moved swiftly toward the entrance spewing demonic qi. The four men instantly rushed in, enduring the immense pressure and disappearing from everyone's sight. Others also took off, rushing into the entrance of demonic qi.

Luo Tian moved swiftly. The tremors grew stronger. His heart became more cautious, but his face was filled with joy. Along this journey, he had killed many ferocious beasts and seized Yin Wuyue and Qin Hefeng's Dantians. He now had over twenty Inner Dantians.

Luo Tian was confident that if he refined these Dantians, his strength would reach the peak of True Immortality or be very close.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian flew toward the central altar, a series of booming sounds echoed in his ears.

"Another ferocious beast? This sound is definitely not just one. It's more like a group!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, increasing his speed toward the direction of the booming sound.

While flying, he felt something was off. This booming sound didn't seem like a single beast but more like a group. However, his joy was stronger. His confidence in his skills made him bold. He had previously killed many ferocious beasts like the Demon Spider, and they hadn't posed a threat to him.

"I'll see what kind it is!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, spreading his spiritual sense outward.

"Damn it!" As his spiritual sense spread out, he finally reached the group of black beasts.

Five figures were running swiftly before this group of ferocious beasts, and behind them was the sound of thunder. The place they passed through was barren. Each massive beast radiated intense demonic qi, collapsing the black sky and chasing Fu Xingyue's five.

"Luotian!" As Luo Tian was distracted, Fu Xingyue and others saw him. Instinctively, they flew toward Luo Tian's direction.

"Don't come over!" Luo Tian shouted and ran. However, it was too late. Fu Xingyue's group quickly reached Luo Tian and joined the escape.

"What happened? Why did you bring so many ferocious beasts?" Luo Tian felt a headache, running alongside Fu Xingyue's group in the vast forest.

"Betrayed by those bastards!" Fu Xingyue spoke angrily. Then he addressed everyone: "Think of a way, running like this isn't good!"

The group quickly exchanged ideas. Fu Xingyue also recounted what had happened to Luo Tian.

"Let's go back. These beasts have always been under the altar, so they don't dare to come up!" Luo Tian spoke. Jiang Yuzhe and others followed him, starting to circle around.

"Someone!" However, before they could return to the altar, they noticed a group of people. Their eyes flickered slightly.

"It's Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yu Feng!" Fu Xingyue immediately recognized a group of eight people, who were Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yu Feng's group. They had arrived later than Luo Tian.

"Jiang Yuzhe!" Seeing Jiang Yuzhe's group, Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yu Feng's faces changed immediately. However, upon thinking about their two groups' strength, they showed cruelty in their eyes.

"Hello!" Luo Tian's group instantly approached them and greeted Jiang Yulong. Then the strong booming sound followed, as a group of beasts chased after Luo Tian's group.

"What is this thing?" Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yu Feng's faces changed immediately. They looked at the group of corrupted beasts.

"Everyone, let's unite and kill these beasts!" Luo Tian laughed. Seeing Jiang Yulong's group, he changed his mind. With so many beasts, killing them all would gain numerous Dantians.

"Unbelievable!" Jiang Yulong's group immediately ran, their speed reaching its peak. Before Luo Tian's group could reach them, they vanished into the distance.

Chapter 2274: Charging Into the Altar()

"Brave guys, you ran faster than us!" Luo Tian sighed internally. If they had a few more seconds, they would have caught up with Jiang Yulong's group. Then there was no way they could avoid being pulled into the water.

"Circle around!" Luo Tian sighed longingly, spoke to Jiang Yuzhe's group and flew into the air, starting to circle toward the altar.

"Wanting us to get involved? You're dreaming!" Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yu Feng's faces showed satisfaction. They watched Luo Tian's group being chased by the beasts, feeling slightly pleased.

"Let's go! We're late. We can't be later!" Jiang Yulong sneered and flew into the air toward the central altar. They had arrived later, but they still wanted to compete.

Time passed. Luo Tian's group circled around the beasts for an hour, finally reaching the central altar.

At this moment, the central altar was empty. No one was around, making Jiang Yuzhe and Fu Xingyue's faces look grim.

"These bastards used us to draw the beasts away, then entered themselves. I'll settle this account!" Fu Xingyue gritted his teeth. The group instantly landed on the altar.

"Roar..." Beasts roared, but they didn't dare to approach the altar. It seemed they had an innate fear.

"That should be the entrance. Let's go!" Luo Tian flew and stood on the entrance spewing demonic qi. His eyes slightly narrowed. He was also anxious. If Jiang Yuzhe succeeded, it would be better for him too. Moreover, he still didn't know how to resolve the issue of killing Qin Hefeng and Yin Wuyue.

Jiang Yuzhe and Fu Xingyue's group also stood at the edge of the entrance, gazing at the black qi spewing entrance. Their bodies involuntarily shivered.

"Go in!" The group simultaneously jumped, enduring the spewing force and rushing into the altar's entrance.

"Boom..." Intense demonic qi swept around Luo Tian, constantly echoing in his surroundings. The spewing demonic qi began to fiercely erode Luo Tian, seeping into his body through his pores.

Luo Tian activated his cultivation technique and started to resist the demonic qi's invasion. He didn't know how long he had been moving, but eventually, the storm around him became smaller. He let out a long breath.

"How are you?" Luo Tian steadied his body and looked around. He saw Fu Xingyue and Jiang Yuzhe's group.

Before the group stood a black space. A black long bridge appeared in their view.

The black long bridge seemed endless, vast and wide. At this moment, the group stood on the bridge. They looked up and saw several figures.

"They're Jiang Yulong's group!" Fu Xingyue immediately recognized them and whispered, his voice echoing in the dark space.

However, Jiang Yulong's group seemed not to hear. They walked slowly on the bridge, and with each step they took, black qi emitted from the bridge.

"They're familiar here. We've walked this bridge before, but it's different now. If we can reach the end of the bridge, it'll be the Demon God Pool! My brother and I were in seclusion there to achieve our current cultivation!" Fu Xingyue spoke to Luo Tian's group.

"Demons God Pool?" Luo Tian frowned slightly. However, seeing Fu Xingyue's evasive gaze, he knew that with their personalities, they might not leave even a single hair.

"Let's go see!" However, the bridge still needed to be crossed. Luo Tian took a step forward and immediately felt black qi rising from the bridge, sweeping toward him. A cold atmosphere fiercely invaded his body.

"Be careful. If I'm not mistaken, this tests our minds and also our strength. We might be eroded by the demonic qi. If so, we'll become like those beasts outside!"

"Also, if you die here, you're dead. Don't try to endure it. If you can't resist, retreat!" Luo Tian spoke to the group.

"Understood!" Luo Tian's words made Jiang Yuzhe's group frown slightly. They felt something was off but couldn't immediately react, so they followed Luo Tian onto the bridge.

Ten zhang... one hundred zhang... In a moment, they had walked over a hundred zhang. The demonic qi became denser and began to penetrate their body's surface barriers.

"This is also a cultivation test!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, feeling the coldness around him. He observed Fu Xingyue and Jiang Yuzhe's group, finding their conditions were good.

However, this was only over a hundred zhang. The demonic qi-covered bridge had no end. At this point, Jiang Yulong's group had already disappeared from Luo Tian's group's sight.

Time slowly passed. The group continued walking, looking at the surrounding void. They had walked for nearly an hour and could no longer see the bridge's starting point.

"What is under this bridge?" Luo Tian thought, gazing at the bottom. At this moment, he felt a cold atmosphere.

But seeing beneath the bridge was still dark and bottomless. He could only continue forward.

"I can't hold on much longer!" Sima Feiying's face was pale, his entire body covered in demonic qi. His eyes showed a hint of pain. Among the group, Luo Tian and Jiang Yuzhe were both in True Immortal late stage. Sima Feiying was in True Immortal peak, so he hadn't dared to say anything.

"Then stay here and wait for us! Once we obtain the World's Heart, it'll be easy to leave!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke softly. Sima Feiying's age wasn't very old, and his character still needed refinement.

"I'll walk a bit more. If I can't hold on, I'll stop!" Sima Feiying spoke, his voice filled with resentment. Since the group had walked this far without anyone stopping, it was clear that those who arrived earlier had endured longer. Since Luo Tian and Jiang Yuzhe hadn't said they couldn't endure, how could he stop?

"Good. Don't force yourself too much. If you can't hold on, say so. Otherwise, it'll be a big problem!" Luo Tian spoke softly. If Sima Feiying was eroded by demonic qi and went crazy, it would definitely cause trouble for them.

The group continued walking. Their speed didn't decrease but increased instead. As time passed, Luo Tian gradually felt uncomfortable. However, his strong willpower made him endure despite the discomfort. He wasn't affected by demonic qi.

Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang were the same. They weren't affected at all. After all, they had been top-tier warriors in the three thousand small worlds. Their willpower was far superior to that of people from the Immortal Realm.
