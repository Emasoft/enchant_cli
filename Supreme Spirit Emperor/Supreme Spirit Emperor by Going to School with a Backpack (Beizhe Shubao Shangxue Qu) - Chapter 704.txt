“‘It’s the Holy Son of Wu Hua Sect!’ The people exclaimed, spotting Yin Wu emerging from the crowd.”

“Why is it only the Holy Son alone? Not a single strong figure from Wu Hua Sect accompanied him?” The people murmured, their curiosity piqued. Yin Wu’s reputation within the sect’s domain was formidable.

Yin Wu furrowed his brows, scanning the thousands surrounding the entrance of Zushen Mountain—his perception instantly encompassing them.

As he probed further, Yin Wu was stunned to discover several auras that eluded his comprehension.

“Numerous formidable figures!” Yin Wu mused, his gaze settling on an elderly man nearby.

The old man wore a black robe, his face withered like tree bark stretched over it, yet his eyes burned with sharp clarity. His aura was restrained, and he leaned on a bamboo staff. Were it not for this place, one might have assumed him to be an old man nearing death.

But Yin Wu was no fool; he sensed the elder was no ordinary person. He strode toward him, a faint smile on his face.

“Respected elder, may I inquire your name?” Yin Wu bowed respectfully.

“I have no name, nor do I remember what it is!” The elder replied softly, glancing at Yin Wu before returning his gaze to the dark forest.

“Elder, do you recognize this tomb’s occupant?” Yin Wu was taken aback by the elder’s aloofness but pressed on with familiarity.

“Stay away from me!” The elder retorted, his brow furrowing as more people gathered around Yin Wu.

“Old fool, you’re about to die! Daring to speak thus to the Holy Son!” Some impetuous individuals barked, seeing the elder’s frail appearance and seeking to ingratiate themselves with Yin Wu.

Yet most remained silent, casting wary glances at the shouting men, inwardly sighing at their foolishness.

Even Yin Wu’s courtesy suggested this elder was no ordinary figure—these men had clearly miscalculated.

The elder seemed deaf, his gaze fixed on Zushen Mountain, his white eyebrows fluttering in the wind.

As chaos erupted here, most turned their attention to Yin Wu’s group, including those auras he could not fathom.

“A fascinating twist—this tomb has drawn so many intriguing figures!” A middle-aged man smiled, eyeing Yin Wu while fanning himself with a folding fan, his demeanor refined.

Beside him stood four attendants, each youthful and beautiful, their eyes wary as they surveyed the surroundings.

In another direction stood an elder in black robes, his physique robust and face scarred by blades. His gaze also fell on Yin Wu’s group.

“Friends, I am the Holy Son of Wu Hua Sect. I humbly request your aid in locating our sect’s strength!” Yin Wu bowed to the crowd.

“I, Yin Wu, shall surely reward you generously!” His words were met with immediate exclamations of support. To them, Yin Wu’s presence seemed far more promising than the opportunity within Zushen Mountain.

“Wait,” one of the elders beside Yin Wu sighed, sitting cross-legged without accepting or rejecting his offer. Meanwhile, the middle-aged man erected a tent, with four attendants tending to him.

Yin Wu sighed inwardly, settling down to ponder the next steps. If these individuals could not be swayed into his camp, they would become adversaries within Zushen Mountain.

Night passed; the next day saw more arrivals at Zushen Mountain’s base, among them Luo Tian.

Among all the ghost cultivators, Luo Tian appeared unremarkable—save for the two characters “Ghost Valley” etched on his back. Yet most ignored them, merely curious.

Yet Luo Tian’s fame in the underworld made many recognize him, their eyes flickering with reverence.

“Luo Tian has arrived!” Yin Wu overheard the murmurs, instantly rising with excitement, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Luo Brother!” Yin Wu leapt into the air, appearing before Luo Tian. Though he could not yet secure the three men nearby, Luo Tian was someone he had previously negotiated with.

“Yin Brother!” Luo Tian smiled, bowing respectfully.

“Luo Brother, have you considered my proposal?” Yin Wu’s gaze brimmed with anticipation.

“Indeed,” Luo Tian replied, “I demand Wu Hua Sect never infringe upon Tianyuan Sect. If you can guarantee this, I shall assist.”

“This…” Yin Wu hesitated, stunned by Luo Tian’s condition. Though he had secured the position of Holy Son this time, it did not grant him authority over such a monumental decision.

“Then I’ll settle for fifty years,” Luo Tian nodded, understanding. “But no matter the form, you must not attack Tianyuan Sect.”

“Too harsh!” Yin Wu inwardly cursed, his face contorted with reluctance.

“I can only promise fifty years,” Yin Wu replied, gazing at Luo Tian. “As for a hundred, I’ll strive to negotiate.”

“Sufficient!” Luo Tian nodded, accepting without hesitation. Fifty years would suffice for him—perhaps even less.

Chapter 2645: Entering Zushen Mountain

“Agreed!” Yin Wu smiled, both men swearing an oath and standing united.

Luo Tian surveyed the surroundings, searching for suspicious figures. He instinctively wrinkled his nose—detecting the scent of Yellow Water Spring.

“Someone is here!” Luo Tian’s heart quickened, scanning each person to identify the one who had sent him a message.

“Hey, kid, what’re you staring at?” When Luo Tian locked eyes with the robust elder, the latter’s face twisted in impatience.

“What’re you looking at?” Luo Tian sneered, unafraid of the elder despite his imposing aura.

“Foolish youth!” The elder strode forward, his gaze fierce. His aura flared abruptly, expanding into a domain that crushed Luo Tian.

The world darkened; the black domain stretched nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine feet—just one foot short of ten thousand, indicating the elder had reached the peak of the Mid-Stage Immortal King.

“An ancient power from the post-ancient era?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He knew many figures from the same epoch as the Nine Sacred Mountains still lived, having encountered a few.

The heavens and hell both harbored such beings—each with unique methods of prolonging life, their strength defying conventional rankings.

“Not bad,” the robust elder smirked coldly, raising his hand to strike Luo Tian.

“Roar…” A roar echoed as Luo Tian unleashed the Tenfold Sword轮回 Domain, its size slightly smaller than the elder’s but no less formidable.

Crack! Crack! Crack… The collision of domains echoed, and Luo Tian’s fist met the elder’s palm with a thunderous clash.

The impact sent both men staggering two steps back, their gazes locking.

“Others I don’t care about,” Luo Tian declared fiercely, “but don’t play games with me. If you’re不服, I’ll cut you down!” His sword qi lashed at the elder’s domain.

Crack! Crack! The elder’s domain shattered, leaving his face stunned.

“Brave kid!”

“But think you’ve got some strength and dare to show off? I ruled the world when you were still a child!” The elder roared, his shattered domain instantly restored with swirling runes.

“Luoli!” The crowd gasped at the elder’s name.

“Indeed, an ancient power!” Even Yin Wu was stunned, his eyes wide with awe as he gazed at the elder.

“What of it? If you anger me, I’ll still cut you down!” Luo Tian remained resolute, his foot pressing the ground as he lunged toward the elder.

“Arrogant little brat!” Luoli sneered, clenching his fists, each crackling with explosive power.

Two fists clashed toward each other—just as their might surged, a tremor erupted from Zushen Mountain.

The world roared; a black vortex burst forth, devouring the forest with whirlwinds.

“Here it comes!” The elder with the withered face shifted his gaze from Luo Tian to Zushen Mountain, his eyes gleaming. He leapt into the air, heading toward the vortex.

Luoli halted mid-motion, flying toward the black vortex instead of confronting Luo Tian.

“Come on, my treasures!” The middle-aged man also soared toward the vortex.

“Too terrifying! They rushed straight into that devouring black vortex!” The crowd gasped, their hearts racing even from afar.

“Ah…” As the crowd marveled, cries of agony erupted—several figures withered instantly, their bodies turning to ash and falling lifelessly.

“What’s happening?” The crowd gasped at the fallen figures, especially those nearby who felt their lives vanish in an instant.

“I remember! These people insulted that elder yesterday!” Someone recalled, their body trembling.

“Luo Brother, go!” Yin Wu barked, leaping into the air toward Luo Tian, fearing they’d lag behind.

“Right!” Luo Tian replied loudly, following Yin Wu’s lead. Having decided to enter, he had no other thoughts.

Numerous figures rushed into Zushen Mountain. Upon entering the forest, they saw the black vortex—a violent suction pulling Luo Tian’s body.

They didn’t hesitate; they rushed toward the vortex, not pulled by it but driven by their own will.

In an instant, they stood before the vortex, its ferocious aura sending waves of dread. Yet they stepped into it regardless.

“Too strong! The vortex just went straight through!” The crowd marveled, watching Luo Tian’s group vanish.

“Go!” After a brief shock, more people rushed toward the black vortex, chaos erupting.

“Ah…” Agony echoed as many turned to blood mist, annihilated by the black vortex. Blood stained the vortex.

“People are dying!” Those who hadn’t yet entered trembled, their fear palpable at the bloody scent.

Yet despite deaths, some—perhaps lucky or strong—entered the vortex.

The black vortex transported Luo Tian into an endless void, his surroundings obscured. Yet he smelled blood.

“Why did we come here?” Luo Tian muttered, dazed and confused, still unaware of the situation.

“Where there is, there is peace!” Luo Tian sighed internally, feeling his fluctuations fade.

After an indeterminate time, Luo Tian landed on solid ground.

“Roar!” As he touched the earth, a roar echoed in his ears. He felt an immense force grasp him, as if a giant hand had seized him.

Chapter 2646: Annihilation Light

Luo Tian’s face twitched as he felt a colossal force gripping him. A towering figure emerged in his vision, its green hand clamping onto him.

The hand thrust him toward a gaping maw—evidently intending to devour him.

Moreover, Luo Tian noticed the giant’s other hand clutched a headless corpse—clearly torn off.

“Break free!” Luo Tian roared, exerting force to pry open the giant’s hand.

Crack! Crack! The sound of creaking fingers echoed around Luo Tian as the giant’s grip trembled. In an instant, Luo Tian broke free.

“Roar!” The giant roared in anger, but Luo Tian had already retreated a thousand feet, finally seeing the giant’s form.

Hundreds of feet tall, its body emerald-green, teeth jagged and uneven. Most striking was the single eye on its head, radiating bloodthirsty energy, while green mist spewed from its nose.

“Cyclops!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, surprised to encounter such a creature.

The Classic of Mountains and Seas recorded Cyclopes as a type of ghostly being, feeding on humans or animals to absorb their essence and enhance their cultivation.

“Early Stage of Immortal King?” Luo Tian sensed the Cyclops’ strength, roughly at Early Stage. Yet these creatures defied conventional logic; their methods were often bizarre, like the immense force that had nearly overwhelmed him.

As he spoke, the Cyclops hurled another corpse into its mouth, crunching it with a satisfying sound. Blood trickled from its lips as it advanced toward Luo Tian.

“Manifestation of the World!” Luo Tian’s hands formed a seal, his body expanding to thousands of feet—towering over the Cyclops. His aura sent the Cyclops into shock.

Though the Cyclops was powerful, its intelligence was lacking. Seeing Luo Tian’s towering form, it hesitated, then turned and fled.

Luo Tian smiled, striding after the Cyclops through the black forest. Two titans clashed in pursuit.

Boom! Boom! Boom… The thunderous sounds echoed as Luo Tian, unaware of the tomb’s size, realized the Cyclops’ single eye was a valuable asset.

“You wouldn’t have killed me if you hadn’t wanted to at first,” Luo Tian mused, “but now I can’t let you live. How many have you devoured?”

The clash of titans continued, the forest in ruins.

As Luo Tian’s fists collided with the Cyclops’ face, a resounding “Boom!” echoed. The Cyclops’ massive body recoiled, colliding with a small mountain and toppling it.

A wail of agony rang out as the Cyclops clutched its mouth, blood gushing. Several teeth had fallen out, and its single eye glowed with vengeful fury.

Luo Tian’s provocation had ignited the Cyclops’ ferocity. It opened its mouth, spewing a stream of green mist—poison!

Luo Tian’s eyes darkened. The poison corroded the air itself, confirming its potency.

Yet others might find it daunting; Luo Tian possessed Ten-Colored Flames, naturally immune to poisons.

Luo Tian raised his hand, and the Ten-Colored Flames erupted from it, unleashing the Infernal Flame. A sea of fire clashed with the poison mist.

Sizzle! Sizzle! The collision of extremes continued, the toxic mist consumed by the Ten-Colored Flames. Luo Tian lunged toward the Cyclops again.

The Cyclops roared, no longer fleeing. Its massive fists collided with Luo Tian’s.

Crack! Thunderous cracks erupted from their clash, the Cyclops’ body recoiling again.

Luo Tian took two steps back, his eyes wide with awe at the Cyclops’ strength. This was only Early Stage of Immortal King.

Luo Tian’s sixfold physical power had still recoiled, proving the Cyclops’ might. Who among Early Stage Immortal Kings could withstand a single punch from Luo Tian?

“Come on, big guy!” Luo Tian chuckled, leaping into the air. The Cyclops roared in response, charging forward—it had realized this man was merely taller and stronger than it.

Boom! Boom! Boom… The two titans clashed repeatedly, the forest in disarray.

Time passed slowly; eventually, the Cyclops grew weary, its body riddled with punch marks. Its arms were torn off by Luo Tian but it still fought fiercely, headbutting Luo Tian’s fists and forcing him to retreat.

“Beast! I’ll see how long you can endure!” Luo Tian muttered, his arm wounds healing.

The Cyclops swayed its head, blood gushing as its eyes flashed with vengeful light. A terrifying aura radiated from its single eye, making Luo Tian’s expression tense.

“Prepared to die?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his body tensed. He didn’t rush forward immediately but raised his hand to grasp a black spear—The Splitting Heaven Spear.

Luo Tian knew the Cyclops had a final, desperate attack: Annihilation Light shot from its eye. This light was overwhelmingly powerful, capable of annihilating enemies. If the Cyclops used it, it meant its last stand.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian marveled, a white light surged, illuminating the forest. A sense of crisis made him more alert, his grip on the spear tightening.

In an instant, a divine light burst from the Cyclops’ eye, emitting a buzzing sound and appearing before Luo Tian.

“Splitting Heaven Spear!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, thrusting his spear toward the light. Instantly, he felt resistance in his hand and a stinging sensation on his skin.

Chapter 2647: The Sinful Obstacle Mirror’s Power

The scorching aura struck Luo Tian, its destructive might nearly overwhelming him.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s divine body shattered, his body recoiling as wounds riddled him. A force seeped into his body through the wounds, eroding his meridians, blood, and cultivation.

“Too strong!” Luo Tian marveled, gazing at the Cyclops whose aura had weakened. Evidently, that attack had cost it dearly too.

Luo Tian shook his body, initiating his cultivation technique to counter the destructive force within him.

But as he fought it off, the Cyclops’ single eye pulsed again, making Luo Tian’s heart leap.

“Another attack?” Luo Tian was astonished; he had thought this attack could only be used once, but it was now repeated.

“Another? Could there be a third?” Luo Tian finally took the Cyclops seriously; another such attack might leave him severely injured.

Though he had been wounded, it was within his capacity to endure. Moreover, his spear had pierced the Cyclops’ abdomen, leaving it more injured than him.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian marveled, a golden vortex appeared in the Cyclops’ eye. Golden divine light burst forth, its power surpassing the previous white light.

Luo Tian ignored the destructive force within him and retreated, raising his hand to summon the Hellish Ghost Claws. They surged toward the Cyclops’ direction.

But the mighty Hellish Ghost Claws were pierced by the golden light, and the annihilating light still approached Luo Tian.

“Damn!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his mind flashing with an idea in a heartbeat. He waved his hand, and a copper mirror appeared before him, expanding instantly.

The Sinful Obstacle Mirror—One of the two top-tier divine artifacts of the Turn Wheel Sect. Luo Tian rarely used it, but this time it saved him.

The Sinful Obstacle Mirror exuded a divine aura, its laws spreading. Almost immediately after blocking the annihilating light, it collided with Luo Tian’s proximity, striking the mirror.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian’s vision turned golden, but this time he felt no pain—instead, the mirror began to absorb his cultivation. The annihilating light seemed absorbed by it, its brilliance surging.

The golden light shot toward the Cyclops’ direction, matching the previous one in power.

The Cyclops was stunned; it hadn’t expected this outcome. In that moment of hesitation, the light struck its throat.

“Roar!” A scream echoed again as the Cyclops, having used two annihilating lights, was pierced through its throat. Its single eye slowly closed, and its massive body collapsed to the ground.

“Tsk tsk!” Luo Tian retrieved the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, its divine laws dimming slightly—evidently, that attack had also damaged it.

“Too close!” Luo Tian sighed, shaking his body to expel the destructive force. He approached the dead Cyclops, his eyes filled with admiration. He retrieved a blood sword and extracted the Cyclops’ eye.

As the eye was removed, the massive eyeball shrank gradually, transforming into a green crystal radiating warmth and vitality. It fell into Luo Tian’s hand.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian just held the eye, the Sinful Obstacle Mirror emitted a tremor. A longing aura filled Luo Tian’s perception.

“You want it?” Luo Tian retrieved the mirror again, a faint smile on his face.

He noticed an indentation on the mirror’s surface, perfectly matching the green crystal’s size.

“You’re quite bold—preparing it yourself!” Luo Tian chuckled, waving his hand to insert the green crystal into the indentation.

“Buzz…” The mirror emitted a tremor, and a consciousness surged into Luo Tian’s mind.

At the same time, numerous indentations appeared on the mirror, making Luo Tian’s scalp tingle.

“Big brother, what else do you want?” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched, feeling the mirror’s enhancement. He helplessly waved his hand, sending several divine crystals from his palm toward the mirror.

These were Luo Tian’s reserves—hesitant to use them, but now all were given to the mirror.

The mirror accepted them without hesitation, and the divine crystals embedded into it. But immediately after, a suction force emanated from the mirror.

Crack! Crack! The divine crystals seemed instantly drained, turning into fragments that fell from the mirror.

Luo Tian was speechless, staring at the mirror. Yet he gritted his teeth and tossed several more crystals into it.

Because he could see the green crystal on the mirror had deepened in color, from light green to dark green.

Moreover, the mirror provided feedback: absorbing divine crystals could convert them into annihilating light. In other words, using divine crystals replenished the annihilating light.

Thus, Luo Tian could wield a powerful technique by activating it. However, only three attacks were possible. After that, he needed to rest for a month and replenish with divine crystals.

“Alright, I trust you!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and began to extract his divine crystals, handing them to the mirror.

At the same time, he was eager to see how strong the annihilating light would be through the mirror. One thing was certain: even an Immortal King in the Mid-Stage might not withstand it, making it another secret weapon for Luo Tian’s Sword Array.

But Luo Tian had clearly underestimated the mirror’s consumption. After half an hour, the mirror was littered with shattered divine crystals devoid of spiritual laws, making Luo Tian’s mouth twitch.

“I’ve become broke again…” Luo Tian muttered, looking at the mirror. Half an hour had drained all his divine crystals into it.

What made him speechless was that so many crystals had only replenished one annihilating light.

“This is way too expensive!” Luo Tian sighed, retrieving the mirror and continuing through the forest.

Chapter 2648: What Family!

Luo Tian stared at the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, still radiating a longing aura. He hadn’t expected it to consume so many divine crystals.

“None left! What family, huh? Do you have a divine crystal mine? Even if you did, it couldn’t withstand your consumption!” Luo Tian muttered, raising his hand to retrieve the mirror.

“Hope the investment pays off—otherwise it’s too costly!” Luo Tian mused internally, gazing at the forest. He didn’t know where to go next.

“This is just the beginning of the tomb, and I’ve already encountered a ghostly being at Early Stage Immortal King. How terrifying would it be deeper inside?” Luo Tian mused, walking through the forest.

“Where are Yin Wu and the others? There must be more than just me here. Who is the tomb’s master?” Luo Tian had many questions, but all would be answered by finding this forest’s exit.

“Lei Yang’s Eye!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with divine light, scanning the surroundings while extending his spiritual awareness. Who knew if there were more dangers?

But after careful observation, he discovered the forest’s limit—ten thousand miles away was its edge. Beyond it, Luo Tian couldn’t see anything, as if blocked by a barrier.

“First, I’ll go out and check!” Luo Tian decided, choosing a direction and walking slowly. He also recovered his injuries along the way.

Ten thousand miles took him an hour, and as he walked, his wounds gradually healed. He emerged at the forest’s edge.

A yellow barrier appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, blocking his view.

Luo Tian smiled slightly and strode toward the barrier. As a descendant of Ghost Valley, it was useless against him.

Luo Tian stepped into the barrier, and the world turned dark. The sky was thick with ghostly qi, the earth desolate, with cracks running across it.

A black pillar of light stretched to the heavens at the center of the dark earth. Luo Tian could clearly see the surging ghostly qi spilling from a gap in it.

“This must be a sacred site for ghost cultivators! The density of the ghostly qi is no less than that in the thirty-third level of Turn Wheel Sect!” Luo Tian murmured. His gaze also caught several figures gathered at the gap, though their identities were unclear due to the distance.

Luo Tian soared into the air toward the gap, arriving there in half a moment.

Dozens of figures stood at the base of a mountain, and the gap was at its peak. Below it, people stood there, their eyes filled with respect upon seeing Luo Tian.

“Holy Son of Turn Wheel Sect!” They respectfully gazed at Luo Tian, but he didn’t spot Yin Wu and the others.

“Where are Yin Wu and the others?” Luo Tian asked, surprised they weren’t here.

“They’ve already descended!” One person replied, their face grim. They had seen Yin Wu and the others rush in.

Luo Tian soared upward, reaching ten thousand feet to gaze down at the black mountain’s entrance.

At once, he understood why these people dared not descend—besides the powerful force within, there were many formidable auras inside.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed in contemplation. At this exit, he sensed a danger—not from the ghostly qi’s auras but something deeper.

“Luosheng Gate, and the one who led me here haven’t appeared yet!” Luo Tian mused. Yet he ultimately raised his Splitting Heaven Spear and rushed into the entrance.

“Go! Follow, this is the only chance!” Seeing Luo Tian descend the entrance, those below erupted in chaos. A wave of figures surged forward, following Luo Tian into the passage.

Luo Tian didn’t care much; he knew what they were after—tagging along to reap the rewards.

“Whoosh!” Wind roared in Luo Tian’s ears, and a powerful force made his breath feel tight. He instantly raised a domain to shield himself.

In an instant, Luo Tian descended a hundred feet, and the surging ghostly qi conjured countless ghostly beings that rushed toward him.

“Die!” Luo Tian spoke, and his domain roared with a cacophony of soul swords, slicing through the ghostly beings.

Boom! Boom! Boom… Each being shattered before Luo Tian, reforming into surging ghostly qi that flowed elsewhere.

Yet these beings were endless, waves after waves attacking Luo Tian’s domain.

Luo Tian himself wasn’t troubled; these beings couldn’t breach his domain, but those following him suffered. Though Luo Tian eliminated them like cutting grass, some still slipped through.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!” The people behind Luo Tian endured immense pressure, occasionally battling the ghostly beings. Their suffering was palpable.

“Ah…” A scream echoed as two people couldn’t endure and were annihilated by the ghostly beings, turning into blood mist and devoured.

As they descended deeper, the ghostly beings grew stronger. People died occasionally.

“Holy Son, save us!” When they reached twenty thousand feet, the people couldn’t endure anymore; blood gushed.

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly, gazing at the fallen and injured—only forty remained. He sighed inwardly.

“I’m too soft!” Luo Tian mused, halting his movement and expanding his domain to encompass the forty.

“If I’m in danger, I won’t have time for you. Take care of yourselves!” Luo Tian addressed the crowd.

“Thank you, Holy Son!” The figures stood within the domain, their eyes filled with reverence as they gazed at the soul swords drifting above it.

Though Luo Tian didn’t fear them, he remained cautious, allocating part of his attention to observe them. In this tomb, besides himself, Luo Tian trusted no one.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian had no idea how far he’d descended, but the ghostly beings grew more numerous and stronger.

“Late Stage of Immortal King!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, gazing at the endless ghostly beings surrounding his domain. His awe deepened.

Crack! A crack echoed as the gray domain developed fissures, making those within it shudder. Their scalp prickled; stepping out would mean certain death.
