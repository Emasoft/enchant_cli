“Didn’t expect that, old man! Didn’t think I’d still be alive, did you? This is thanks to your Shadow-Refining Grass!” Gu Lei sneered at the elder with the surname Dai.

Zhang Xuantian finally understood upon hearing this, his gaze shifting to Luo Tian as he asked solemnly: “You are Luo Tian?”

“Indeed, I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed out, hoarse yet laced with amusement as he gazed at Zhang Xuantian. He longed to witness the expression on Zhang Xuantian’s face upon realizing he was once the revered elder.

Zhang Xuantian’s body trembled at hearing Luo Tian’s voice, his face contorted with bewilderment. He pointed at Luo Tian in silence, regret surging within him. If he still failed to comprehend the situation, he would no longer deserve his title as Lord of Xuantian City. He recognized Luo Tian as the elder from the Bone-Refining Stage who had once commanded his respect, yet he could not fathom why Luo Tian possessed such formidable power.

Luo Tian circulated his spiritual energy, dispersing the medicinal effects of the elixir and reverting to his natural voice. “How about that, old man? Didn’t expect me to be the elder who once earned your respect!”

“Unbelievable!” Zhang Xuantian muttered with a bitter expression. Naturally, he was aware of Luo Tian’s actions in recruiting disciples for the Five Elements Sect. As he recalled his illegitimate son Zhang Daoyi’s tragic death, a sinister expression crept across his face.

“Guess that’s why you came here—to reclaim your dignity!” Zhang Xuantian asked solemnly.

“Hmph, of course. Old dog, today we’re here to finish you off! Luo Tian, leave Zhang Xuantian to you; I’ll handle the old man. Today, I’ll let him taste the bitterness of poison and settle our grudge!” Gu Lei declared before lunging at the elder with the surname Dai.

The elder with the surname Dai, surprised by Gu Lei’s attack, narrowed his eyes. “Body Refinement Stage Seven!”

The elder hadn’t expected the young man he had once underestimated to have advanced to Body Refinement Stage Seven within half a year. Before he could react, Gu Qiansnow also unleashed her cultivation level, charging at the guards accompanying them.

“Body Refinement Stage Eight!” Zhang Xuantian observed Gu Qiansnow’s cultivation level, his expression flickering with surprise. He had heard the elder mention that the three of them had previously reached at most Body Refinement Stage Five. In just half a year, one of them had ascended to Stage Eight—this rate of progress was terrifying. He turned his gaze toward Luo Tian, the group’s main force.

Luo Tian let out a light laugh. There was no need for Gu Lei and the others to intervene; they were all at the Bone-Refining Stage. To deal with these people was a waste of their talents.

He clenched his fists lightly, then leapt forward toward Zhang Xuantian. To the astonishment of all, Luo Tian did not reveal his cultivation level but radiated a confident aura.

Seeing Luo Tian approach without revealing his power, Zhang Xuantian’s face tightened. He could clearly sense the explosive strength radiating from Luo Tian’s body and refused to back down, charging forward with a surge of fire-element spiritual energy. He met Luo Tian’s fist head-on.

Luo Tian narrowed his eyes upon sensing Zhang Xuantian’s cultivation level. “Body Refinement Stage Nine! I didn’t expect you to have made such progress in half a year!”

Luo Tian had only achieved his current cultivation level within the Five Elements Sect. The resources of this small Xuantian City could not compare to those of the vast Five Elements Sect. For instance, the intensity of spiritual energy alone was incomparable.

“Boom…” The two clashed like ferocious beasts, shaking the ears of those nearby.

Both men retreated. Zhang Xuantian observed Luo Tian cautiously, surprised that he could match him evenly without revealing his power. Though he had only used half of his strength, this still left him astounded.

The onlookers stared in shock at the retreating Luo Tian. Zhang Xuantian had long held dominion over Xuantian City, his name deeply embedded in the hearts of these people. The fact that this young man, barely twenty, could match Zhang Xuantian evenly without revealing his power left them speechless.

“Who is this youth? Could he be a direct disciple of some sect? What kind of talent does he possess to be so formidable!” Exclamations echoed from the crowd.

“Hmph, I feel like I’ve seen him before…”

“Is it him? Do you remember half a year ago, when he caused such a stir in Xuantian City by crippling Zhang Qi’s legs?”

Some of the city’s long-term residents finally recalled the posters that had once covered Xuantian City. The image on those posters was unmistakably the three young men before them.

“It’s him! I remember now. Who would have thought that the young man who was chased like a dog half a year ago could be so strong now!” People murmured in astonishment.

“Five Elements Sect, truly the dominant force of the Northern Region. I didn’t expect you to progress so rapidly in just half a year!” Zhang Xuantian also gazed at Luo Tian with complex emotions, murmuring lowly. A hint of regret flickered in his heart—had he not provoked these three young men, there would be no such trouble today.

Luo Tian let out a light laugh. “It’s too late to regret now. I can only say you brought this upon yourself!”

Chapter 92: Zhang Xuantian’s Dependence

Luo Tian was puzzled. He didn’t understand why Zhang Xuantian knew he was a disciple of the Five Elements Sect yet still dared to confront him openly. Did he not fear retaliation from the Five Elements Sect? What was his reliance? Just based on his Body Refinement Stage Nine, Luo Tian would never believe it.

“Regardless of your reliance, you won’t escape today. I am not someone easily hunted!” Luo Tian sneered and let his spiritual energy surge, drawing astonished gazes from the crowd.

Upon seeing Luo Tian reveal his cultivation level, Zhang Xuantian’s face finally showed shock. “Body Refinement Stage Nine!”

The onlookers gasped as they saw Luo Tian’s revealed cultivation level. Though Body Refinement Stage Nine was nothing special within the Five Elements Sect, it was remarkable in a secular city.

When Zhang Xuantian had reached Body Refinement Stage Eight, he could command an entire city. One can imagine the impact of a Body Refinement Stage Nine master, especially one so young!

As people marveled at this, Luo Tian’s figure had already reached Zhang Xuantian’s side. A fire dragon followed instantly—Luo Tian’s martial skill, the Flame Dragon Hand.

Zhang Xuantian glanced at Luo Tian’s technique and sneered. “Though you’ve reached Body Refinement Stage Nine, this skill is pitifully weak!”

Zhang Xuantian spoke and his hands began to shift, emitting a scorching heat.

“Thunder-Heaven Flame Palm!” Zhang Xuantian coldly declared. His crimson palm descended from above, shattering Luo Tian’s Flame Dragon Hand and scattering sparks.

The surrounding people felt the air around them seemed to ignite. “The Lord’s signature technique, a High-Grade Martial Skill!” they murmured.

Gu Lei and the others nodded in approval. “Unexpectedly, a city lord could possess such strength!”

“Ugh, this is so boring. What’s Luo Tian thinking? Just finish him off!” Ning Qingshu yawned.

“If I’m not mistaken, little brother is probably consolidating his cultivation. Otherwise, with his strength, defeating this trash would take only a few breaths!” Gu Lei replied.

Luo Tian mused as his Flame Dragon Hand dispersed. “Indeed, this technique isn’t enough to deal with someone like Zhang Xuantian. I should find a subsequent skill before using this again!”

With that thought, Luo Tian’s hands shifted. The King of Men Seal formed slowly in his palm, radiating a terrifying pressure as he pushed it forward.

Seeing the seal forming in Luo Tian’s hands, Zhang Xuantian’s face contorted. He felt the overwhelming pressure of the King of Men Seal, far surpassing his previous Flame Dragon Hand. His body trembled as fire-element spiritual energy surged forth.

“Xuan Fire Shield! Thunder-Heaven Flame Palm!” Zhang Xuantian, unwilling to hold back, unleashed two High-Grade Martial Skills against the seal hovering over his head.

“Boom! Clang! Clang!” Three resounding explosions echoed in the ears of the onlookers.

The people trembled as the seal shattered Zhang Xuantian’s techniques and continued to strike him. It was overwhelming; most of the crowd were only Body Refinement Stage Four or Five, rarely witnessing anyone above Stage Six. They knew they couldn’t even withstand Luo Tian’s first Flame Dragon Hand.

A cloud of dust rose. Since it was at the city gate, the ground was merely ordinary yellow earth without any defensive measures. A massive deep pit formed at Xuantian City’s gate, and Zhang Xuantian stood battered within it, his clothes in tatters save for a golden armor.

“High-Grade Armor?” Luo Tian observed the glistening gold armor on Zhang Xuantian with interest.

“Unexpectedly, you’re so strong. I admit I’m not your match. But do you think that’s enough to finish me off?” Zhang Xuantian’s cold voice echoed, leaping out of the pit.

“Ah…” As they spoke, Gu Lei’s battle had already concluded. The elder with the surname Dai, his face flushed alternately red and purple, bore grotesque wounds. His hands continuously clawed at various parts of his body in agony.

“Haha, old man, you’re not one to use poison? Why don’t you use it then! Come on, use it!” Gu Lei laughed as he flung the elder to the ground.

The crowd shuddered at the sight of the elder’s pitiful state, their gazes toward Gu Lei filled with fear.

Gu Qiansnow had already concluded her battle. Her Body Refinement Stage Eight was like a grown-up against children, easily subduing the guards and returning to Ning Qingshu’s side.

“Ah? What else do you have up your sleeve?” Seeing everyone had been dealt with, Luo Tian smiled lightly and called out. His gaze, however, held a hint of tension—his spiritual senses had detected two cloaked figures.

“Two of you, I accept your conditions. Just promise to spare my life and my son’s!” Zhang Xuantian cried out toward Xuantian City.

“Zhang Xuantian, Zhang Xuantian. If you had said that earlier, it would have been easier! You’ve wasted our time!” Two dark figures shot forth like lightning from the crowd, arriving before Zhang Xuantian in an instant.

“Them!” Luo Tian’s gaze darkened slightly as he observed the two figures. The crescent moon markings on their robes were unforgettable. If it weren’t for his teacher’s jade pendant, his Chronological Book might have been exposed then. Seeing them now was no surprise.

As the two figures appeared, Gu Lei, Ji Chen, and Ning Qingshu’s casual demeanor shifted slightly.

“Bone-Refining Stage?” Ning Qingshu looked at the figure with a slightly round crescent moon on his robe, surprise flickering across his face. He hadn’t expected a Bone-Refining Stage presence in Xuantian City.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian frowned, curious about these people who weren’t afraid of the Five Elements Sect in the Northern Region.

“We’re not important. Just know we’re people you can’t afford to provoke,” the cloaked figure spoke. “Believe me, if you don’t release Zhang Xuantian and his son, even as a Five Elements Sect disciple, you won’t escape!”

Chapter 94: Journey to Tianyuan City

“Senior Brother, don’t let them escape!” Luo Tian’s spiritual senses had been on high alert. He sensed one of the cloaked figures pulling out a talisman, his face darkening as he shouted at Gu Lei.

Gu Lei, who had been casual moments ago, was startled by Luo Tian’s words. He shifted his body and launched a punch toward the spot where the cloaked figure had disappeared.

“Boom!” The explosion echoed, and several feet of Xuantian City’s thick wall collapsed with a heavy sound.

“He escaped!” Gu Lei looked at the fallen wall, his expression changing. To escape his punch despite using a talisman was no small feat.

This all happened in the blink of an eye. The cloaked figure’s words still echoed in people’s ears as they gazed at the collapsed wall. Their eyes carried reverence, especially toward Gu Lei and his companions.

Luo Tian’s group felt a tightening in their chests. They hadn’t expected the cloaked figure to be so strong, able to escape Gu Lei’s sight. Though Gu Lei had been careless, it still proved the cloaked figure was formidable.

Gu Lei’s gaze turned contemplative. He turned to everyone and said, “These two cloaked figures are strange. From our fight, I felt their spiritual energy was peculiar—vaguely hinting at destruction. My lightning-element spiritual energy is already fierce, yet I felt it was subtly suppressed by theirs!”

Hearing Gu Lei’s words, Luo Tian and the others were shocked. They hadn’t expected their opponent to be so unconventional.

“Haha, you’ve made enemies of them. Your days won’t be easy!” Zhang Xuantian’s weak voice echoed, seeing the group’s tension. His face held a triumphant expression.

“Tell us! Who are they? Why did they come to Xuantian City?” People turned their attention toward Zhang Xuantian and his son, as well as the elder with the surname Dai.

Gu Lei shouted loudly, hoping to get some clues about the cloaked figures from Zhang Xuantian.

“Want to know? Free my son, and I’ll tell you!” Zhang Xuantian bargained. Though the three had been tortured by Gu Lei, he still held back to demand his son’s life.

“Hmph, that’s blackmail!” Gu Lei scoffed.

“It’s not blackmail. It’s a trade. You all know what kind of person my son is. Even if you let him go, he won’t be a threat to you. Do you really fear such a useless person?” Zhang Xuantian continued, seeing Gu Lei’s response.

“Good argument. Though we don’t fear your useless son, we still want to avoid future trouble. Your conditions are unacceptable. If you don’t speak, it’s fine. I have a million ways to make you talk!” Gu Lei said with disdain, seeing Zhang Xuantian try to speak further. He slapped him across the face and laughed.

“Enough, let’s find a place to rest. I’m exhausted!” Ning Qingshu spoke up, stretching and revealing her perfect curves, causing the crowd to drool.

The others agreed. Under the reverent gazes of the people, they entered Xuantian City and checked into a high-end inn.

That night, after eating some simple food, they all went to their rooms. To the surprise of everyone, that night, a ghostly wailing sound echoed from the inn, making other guests think it was haunted.

The next morning, Gu Lei emerged from his room under the expectant gazes of the group. Seeing their eyes, he scratched his head: “I said it, but Zhang Xuantian doesn’t know their identities. He only knows they’re terrifying and powerful, with great ambitions. They’ve been contacting Zhang Xuantian for half a year. As for their sect, he doesn’t know.”

Luo Tian and the others felt disappointment upon hearing Gu Lei’s words. These two cloaked figures were too mysterious, leaving them uneasy.

“This Northern Region is known for the Five Elements Sect being the top sect. However, people outside don’t know that several other sects here actually have strength comparable to the Five Elements Sect. They just remain low-key,” Gu Lei explained to Luo Tian and Gu Qiansnow.

Luo Tian’s group felt even more uneasy. They hadn’t expected the Northern Region to be so full of hidden talents, and they resolved to stay low in the future. Otherwise, one might accidentally provoke someone they shouldn’t.

After a simple meal, they dragged Zhang Xuantian and the others out of Xuantian City and into a forest outside the city.

“Luo Tian, what should we do with these three?” Gu Lei asked, looking at Zhang Xuantian and the others.

At this moment, Zhang Xuantian and the others had already been poisoned by Gu Lei and were unconscious. Zhang Xuantian’s face was unrecognizable, no longer bearing the aura of a city lord.

Luo Tian heard Gu Lei’s question and glanced at the unconscious three, sighing. He knew that in this world of survival of the fittest, if it weren’t for his rapid cultivation growth, they might have been in a worse situation.

“Kill!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness as he struck Zhang Xuantian’s head.

They disposed of the three corpses and continued their journey.

...

Tianyuan City, Gu Family.

These past few days, Gu Yun had been uneasy. Every day, a large number of Five Elements Sect disciples arrived in Tianyuan City, and the weakest among them was Body Refinement Stage Eight. How could Gu Yun not be alarmed?

“Master Gu, I believe Senior Brother Luo will arrive in Tianyuan City soon!” Dong San Si said cautiously to Gu Yun.

Dong San Si had been exhausted these past few days. He had arranged for the Five Elements Sect disciples who came to Tianyuan City under Luo Tian’s name.

Although Dong San Si was only at Body Refinement Stage Seven, the Five Elements Sect knew he was Luo Tian’s representative outside.

Luo Tian had always relied on Dong San Si to handle the alchemy while he was in the Five Elements Sect. Thus, these proud disciples of the Five Elements Sect gave Dong San Si some respect. Plus, Dong San Si was a meticulous person who had arranged the disciples very satisfactorily.

Gu Yun looked at Dong San Si with admiration. If it weren’t for Dong San Si, he alone would have been overwhelmed. As a Five Elements Sect disciple, who cared about the head of an ordinary family? Though some knew he had a connection with Luo Tian, it was only a few people.

“Once Luo Tian arrives, we can relax!”

Gu Lei handed Dong San Si a cup of tea and chuckled lightly. His eyes also carried some nostalgia, recalling the first time he met Luo Tian.

Chapter 93: The Mysterious Cloaked Figures

“Then tell me, why should I release him?” Luo Tian saw the cloaked figure’s confident smile and instantly appeared before Zhang Xuantian, delivering a punch with all his strength.

Zhang Xuantian had already endured the King of Men Seal. Though it was partially blocked by his technique and High-Grade Armor, he still suffered heavy injuries. Seeing Luo Tian’s punch with a roaring sound, he knew it was no good and tried to dodge. But how could he match Luo Tian’s speed when he unleashed his full strength?

“Boom!” A heavy sound echoed.

Looking at Zhang Xuantian’s High-Grade Armor, it shattered visibly. Zhang Xuantian winced in pain and bent over, flying backward.

Before he could fly far, Luo Tian pushed off the ground and instantly appeared before Zhang Xuantian. He grabbed him with one hand and flung him toward Gu Lei.

Gu Lei saw Zhang Xuantian fall before him. He sneered and, without hesitation, pulled out a red pill from his sleeve. He opened Zhang Xuantian’s mouth and shoved it in.

“Old man, taste my new poison pill! You’re the first to try its flavor!” Gu Lei laughed.

The cloaked figure, seeing Luo Tian dare to capture Zhang Xuantian in front of him, could have saved Zhang Xuantian with his Bone-Refining Stage. However, he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so bold as to do this in front of him. In his carelessness, he was caught off guard and lost the chance to save Zhang Xuantian.

“Good! Good! Good! Young man, you’ve got guts. I’ll tell you why!” The cloaked figure laughed angrily but his aura suddenly escalated.

“Bone-Refining Stage!” The onlookers stared in fear at the cloaked figure. They were all Body Refinement Stage cultivators; when had they seen a Bone-Refining Stage master?

At this moment, seeing the Bone-Refining Stage and his aura uncontained, these Body Refinement Stage people felt a sense of helplessness. Some with lower cultivation even trembled slightly.

“This world, who has the biggest fist, is the boss. You’re just a Body Refinement Stage cultivator, yet you dare to be arrogant in front of me? Why should I tell you why? Because I am Bone-Refining Stage, and you are Body Refinement Stage!” The cloaked figure spoke with a bold aura. His pressure suddenly surged toward Luo Tian and the others.

In his mind, these people were geniuses but hadn’t faced much pressure. In their sects, they had been pampered flowers. Under his pressure, they would surely not hold out.

However, when the cloaked figure turned back to see them on the ground in despair, he felt a sudden heat.

The cloaked figure turned back and didn’t see them on the ground in despair but instead saw six people looking at him like fools. He was momentarily stunned.

At this moment, Gu Lei seemed unaffected and observed Zhang Xuantian’s condition. The other five waited for the cloaked figure to speak.

They naturally knew the pressure was directed at them. However, Luo Tian, Gu Lei, and Gu Qiansnow had all felt greater pressure on the Ascension Stairs. Plus, they had experienced the pressure of the Yuan Ling Stage. They didn’t care about this minor Bone-Refining Stage pressure.

As for Gu Lei and the others, they were even more so. They were all Bone-Refining Stage geniuses. Gu Lei and Ji Chen were even close to the Bone-Refining Stage Final. They didn’t care about this minor pressure.

“You?” The cloaked figure couldn’t speak, pointing at Luo Tian and the others.

“Oh, you’re Bone-Refining Stage? Unfortunately, you are only at the initial stage of Bone-Refining!” Gu Lei said lazily.

His words fell, and a pressure from the middle stage of Bone-Refining rose from Gu Lei and Ji Chen. At the same time, Ning Qingshu’s aura suddenly surged. The three of them combined their auras into an invisible dragon, pressing toward the cloaked figure with Gu Lei’s voice.

“Three Bone-Refining Stage!” The crowd trembled as they watched Gu Lei and the others.

“Did I see that right? So young, Bone-Refining Stage! My god, I feel like I’ve lived my life in vain these years!” People marveled and rubbed their eyes, unable to believe. When they confirmed it wasn’t a mistake, fear filled their eyes.

The eldest among them, Gu Lei, was only twenty-seven. Such a young Bone-Refining Stage master—how could one not be astonished?

“You… you are also Bone-Refining Stage?” The cloaked figure, overwhelmed by their pressure, couldn’t speak. His voice was stammering as he looked at them.

Zhang Xuantian, though in unbearable pain—his body felt like it was plunged into an icy chamber one moment and roasted by fire the next—was still a veteran. His willpower was strong, but he remained clear-minded, hoping the cloaked figure would save him and his son.

However, when Zhang Xuantian saw Gu Lei’s formidable aura, he felt a deep despair. Facing Gu Lei and the others, the cloaked figure would struggle to protect himself, let alone save him.

“Why? You’re Bone-Refining Stage but don’t allow others to be?” Gu Lei stepped forward, stretched his limbs, and beckoned the cloaked figure.

“You dare to look down on me?” The cloaked figure, seeing Gu Lei’s slight disrespect, trembled with anger.

“Looking down on you? What of it!” Gu Lei didn’t waste words. His body moved like lightning, and before he reached the cloaked figure’s side, he delivered a punch.

Luo Tian watched Gu Lei’s punch with admiration. A Bone-Refining Stage master was indeed far stronger than a Body Refinement Stage one.

Gu Lei’s seemingly simple punch was beyond the reach of a Body Refinement Stage cultivator. This punch, accompanied by flashes of lightning, seemed to pierce through space and instantly reached the cloaked figure’s side.

The cloaked figure didn’t dare to block directly. After all, he was only at the initial stage of Bone-Refining. He circulated his spiritual energy and his body became elusive, emitting a faint gray mist from his body.

As people thought Gu Lei’s punch would hit, the cloaked figure had already moved tens of feet away.

“Why don’t you fight directly?” Gu Lei sneered.

“Hmph! You all wait. This isn’t over. We’ll meet again!” The cloaked figure coldly said, then pulled out a yellow talisman and pressed it to his chest.

As the talisman touched his chest, his speed reached a terrifying level. The crowd’s eyes couldn’t react in time. Within one breath, he had reached another Body Refinement Stage companion and grabbed him before vanishing from the spot.

Chapter 95: Return to Tianyuan City

“Haha, Tianyuan City! I’m back!” Gu Lei shouted, drawing strange glances from the common people entering the city.

Half a year had passed since Gu Lei and Gu Qiansnow first left home. It felt long for them, but now they looked at Tianyuan City’s gate with excitement, their faces filled with joy.

Luo Tian gazed at the familiar city gate of Tianyuan City, his heart complex. He recalled when he first arrived in Tianyuan City, he was merely a Body Refinement Stage Two cultivator. He had to be cautious around people like Li Yuande. Now, he was at Body Refinement Stage Nine, far beyond his former self.

“Sister! What fun places are there in Tianyuan City? You must show me! I haven’t gone out for a long time. Every time I go out, it’s for missions. This time, I want to relax!” Ning Qingshu was also excited, grabbing Gu Qiansnow’s hand and walking into Tianyuan City.

As they walked along the wide streets of Tianyuan City, they drew many people’s attention. When people saw Luo Tian and Gu Qiansnow leading the group, they were stunned.

“Is this the daughter and son of the Gu family? Is that young man the one who caused Li Family’s downfall?” People murmured, still remembering the event half a year ago.

“Hmph, it seems you three are celebrities here in Tianyuan City!” Ning Qingshu joked.

“Hmph, back then my sister was the top girl among Tianyuan City’s youth! If she hadn’t met Luo Tian, she would still be the same personality!” Gu Lei laughed and began recounting Gu Qiansnow’s past stories, some of which even Luo Tian didn’t know.

Hearing Gu Lei gossiping about herself, Gu Qiansnow blushed slightly. Then she grabbed Gu Lei’s ear and made everyone laugh.

The six of them chatted and laughed as they arrived at the Gu family’s front gate. Seeing the guards, Gu Lei waved his hand: “Come on, let’s go to my house. I’ll have my father entertain you!”

“Who are you?” The young guard at the gate stopped them, asking lowly.

“Uh…” Gu Lei was momentarily stunned. He hadn’t expected to be stopped at his own front door, feeling a bit embarrassed.

“Are you new? You don’t recognize me?” Gu Lei pointed at his nose, asking.

“No. Show your identity proof, or we won’t be polite!” The guard looked down on Gu Lei.

“Call me Gu Lei, the eldest son of the Gu family!” Seeing the guard’s arrogance, Gu Lei frowned slightly.

“Spit! Don’t try to trick me. I’m new, but I’ve heard of our master’s physique and strength. You’re not like that!” The guard sneered, clearly believing he had figured it out.

“Okay, okay! I’ll prove who I am!” Gu Lei sighed. He had encountered such a rare person upon returning home, feeling his face was a bit embarrassed. He reached into his storage bag to take out the Gu family’s identity jade token.

The guard watched Gu Lei prepare to prove his identity and folded his arms, waiting.

Luo Tian and the others waited for Gu Lei to take out the item so they could enter.

Gu Lei fumbled around, his face showing embarrassment. He turned to Gu Qiansnow and said: “Sister, did you bring your jade token?”

Gu Qiansnow was stunned. She usually entered and exited without anyone stopping her. Who would need such an item? Now she hadn’t expected to be stopped at home, and her face was also embarrassed.

Gu Lei saw Gu Qiansnow’s expression and knew his sister was in the same boat as him.

“Go get Uncle Tian. He can prove our identities.” Gu Lei said to the guard with a serious face.

The guards had seen many Five Elements Sect disciples entering and exiting the Gu family. In their eyes, the Five Elements Sect was a godlike presence. These people entering and exiting the Gu family were always respectful.

This situation made some of the Gu family’s guards inflate their egos. They looked down on anyone not in the Five Elements Sect.

Luo Tian’s group had changed out of their Five Elements Sect uniforms upon arriving in Xuantian City, returning to casual attire. The guards naturally questioned them, thinking they were people trying to flatter the Gu family. After all, many such people had been stopped recently.

“Haha, got it! You’ve seen enough of this. Just trying to flatter us!” The guard looked down on Gu Lei and scoffed.

“Uncle Tian, I’m Gu Lei! I’ve returned!” Gu Lei, hearing the guard’s words, finally decided not to argue. He shouted into the courtyard. Though Gu Lei had the ability to enter the Gu family, it would be embarrassing if he did so.

Gu Lei’s voice was like a thunderclap, nearly knocking the guard with Body Refinement Stage Three to the ground. He stared in disbelief at Gu Lei.

The guard hadn’t expected this young man to have such high cultivation. A bad feeling crept into his heart, recalling the rumors—his master had once been a loudmouth.

Gu Lei’s voice hadn’t echoed long before he saw a group of people coming out from the inner gate. The leader was Gu Yun, with Dong San Si by his side. Uncle Tian stood behind them along with a group of Gu family elders, all rushing over.

“Little bastard! You’re back. Why are you shouting?” Gu Yun’s eyes were filled with excitement as he shouted, clearly missing his children after half a year.

“Father!” Gu Lei and Gu Qiansnow knelt, respectfully calling out to Gu Lei.

“Good! Good! Good! It’s good you’re back!” Gu Yun was overjoyed, helping up Gu Lei and Gu Qiansnow. He could sense from Gu Lei’s shout that his cultivation had surpassed him.

“Master Gu, it’s been a while!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully. He always held gratitude toward Gu Yun and, given his relationship with Gu Qiansnow, Gu Yun deserved this bow.

Gu Yun turned to Luo Tian. Seeing Luo Tian still so respectful toward him, he felt欣慰 (satisfaction). He secretly thought that his decision to save Luo Tian was the most correct choice he had made in years.

After helping Luo Tian up and exchanging a few words with Gu Lei and the others, they all marched into the Gu family’s gate.

Gu Lei turned back to the guard who had stopped him and smiled: “Ah, now do you believe I’m your master?”

Chapter 96: Departing for Feiyun Sect

“M-m-master, I apologize!” The guard’s legs trembled. If he still didn’t understand the situation, he would have lived in vain.

“Come on, don’t stay as a guard. It’s too much for you!” Gu Lei pulled the trembling guard up and walked inside.

“Gu Xiaozi, how are you going to punish him?” Ning Qingshu asked Gu Lei with interest.

“Haha, what else? I’ve been researching some poisons these past days. No one has tested them yet!” Gu Lei laughed at the guard.

The guard’s face twitched. He wished he could slap himself twice.

“Don’t worry, with me here, you won’t die!”

Gu Lei laughed and gave the guard a reassuring look.

The guard saw Gu Lei’s gaze, his heart naturally shivered. A thought drifted through his mind: “Don’t act tough; acting tough gets you punished!”

Gu Lei laughed and dragged the guard, who was met with pitying glances from others, into the compound.

...

Night…

Luo Tian and others were treated to a lavish dinner arranged by Gu Yun.

“I thank everyone for coming to help. I promise here that after this matter is resolved, I will freely craft two batches of elixirs for Bone-Refining Stage seniors and one batch for Body Refinement Stage peers. I guarantee these elixirs will be seven parts herbal essence!” Luo Tian stood up and promised to the crowd.

“Haha, Senior Luo, you’re too kind. This is just a small matter; it’s our duty!”
