Time meandered forward slowly. Gu Qianxue’s eyes finally revealed a grave expression, for before him stood dozens of formidable ghostly entities. Their forms were uniformly black but had begun to resemble human shapes, radiating powerful auras that caused the food-energy ghosts under Luo Tian’s control to tremble in fear.

“Hastening Ghosts…” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, recalling the records of these entities in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. His heart pounded with concern for Gu Qianxue’s safety.

“How could there be such formidable ghosts in the Tianlong Sect?” Luo Tian muttered低声, his mind racing. If one could master the ghosts within this tomb, it would be enough to sustain a sect.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian pondered, Gu Qianxue moved. His hands formed intricate seals, and within his white fingers, complex talismans were etched before being imprinted onto his body.

The hastening ghosts, which had been restless since Gu Qianxue’s arrival, now returned to their former composure, allowing him to pass unimpeded.

“Roar…” Just as Luo Tian prepared to command the food-energy ghosts to pursue Gu Qianxue, one of the leading hastening ghosts suddenly let out a low growl. It devoured one of Luo Tian’s subdued food-energy ghosts, startling Gu Qianxue into halting abruptly.

“Ah… it was merely a food-energy ghost that had wandered here!” Gu Qianxue sighed deeply upon witnessing the scene, then proceeded into the tomb’s depths. Luo Tian’s gaze vanished entirely.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed under his breath. Though ghosts possessed little consciousness, higher-level ones retained some awareness and fiercely guarded their territories.

“Is Qianxue in danger?” Luo Tian’s first thought was Gu Qianxue’s safety, wondering whether he should step out. Yet the notion vanished instantly—his abilities paled in comparison to Gu Qianxue’s. He would likely perish before reaching her, felled by the countless ghosts.

“Is this place deliberately arranged by the Tianlong Sect to harbor so many ghosts?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows.

“Perhaps it was prepared for the War of Heaven,” Luo Tian deduced swiftly. The tomb’s depths must conceal something extraordinary to sustain such a horde of ghosts.

“But how did Qianxue know?” Luo Tian’s mind grew more puzzled, questioning what had transpired to change Gu Qianxue so drastically. She seemed unrecognizable, as if she had become a different person entirely.

“She must have come for something within the tomb’s depths,” Luo Tian mused, “and she seems well-prepared.”

“Wait. All I can do now is wait for her to emerge from the tomb,” Luo Tian sighed, then resumed refining his Ghost-Controlling Seal. He also began subduing the ghosts.

With the seal at its initial stage, Luo Tian’s practice became effortless. The thirty-plus food-energy ghosts he had subdued continuously expelled ghostly qi, complementing the external qi absorbed by the seal. No need for his direct oversight.

Time passed slowly. A night had elapsed, and the sky faintly revealed streaks of light. Under Luo Tian’s anxious wait, Gu Qianxue finally emerged from the tomb’s depths—but her face bore a look of exhaustion, bloodstains dampening her robes.

Upon seeing Gu Qianxue, Luo Tian withdrew his ghost-controlling seal and collected the food-energy ghosts. He rose from the thatched hut, meeting Gu Qianxue as she stepped out.

“Is it you?” Gu Qianxue’s eyes flickered with surprise, then flashed with murderous intent.

“What business do you have in the Tianlong Tomb?” Luo Tian spoke softly, extending a pill toward her.

“You don’t have the right to ask!” Gu Qianxue coldly replied, refusing the pill. She had not expected to meet Luo Tian here; she assumed he was still a disciple under Xuan Dan, not guarding this desolate tomb.

“Answer me—why have you come to the male outer disciples’ domain as a female outer disciple?” Luo Tian barked, his usual gentleness replaced by an assertive tone. He knew kindness would not sway Gu Qianxue, so he adopted a different approach.

“Leave… don’t force me to kill you!” Gu Qianxue’s voice was sharp, and black mist erupted from her body, radiating a formidable aura.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed—this Gu Qianxue now felt like a threat to him.

“Do you think you can silently eliminate me?” Luo Tian’s aura rose, his gaze fixed on Gu Qianxue.

“Give me a chance to explain,” Luo Tian added before she could respond, “and I may let you go. From now on, it’ll be as if this never happened.”

“Seeking a treasure,” Gu Qianxue mused, though confident, she knew Luo Tian spoke truth. To defeat him, she would have to resort to that power.

“What treasure?” Luo Tian nodded slightly; his suspicions were confirmed—something extraordinary lay within the tomb’s depths.

Gu Qianxue’s eyes flickered, her gaze shifting with a seductive glint. “Do you desire me so much?”

“Huh?” Luo Tian was stunned, unprepared for Gu Qianxue’s sudden shift from icy hostility to flirtatiousness.

“Something’s off!” Luo Tian quickly regained his composure, noting the fleeting disdain in Gu Qianxue’s gaze.

“What favor?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, scrutinizing her. Though he would help her, her current demeanor unsettled him.

Gu Qianxue stepped closer, their eyes locking as she exhaled softly, her breath brushing Luo Tian’s face.

“I wish to enter the tomb tomorrow night,” she said, her voice laced with a transformation. If Luo Tian were to describe her now, he’d call her a sorceress.

“Fine,” Luo Tian nodded, his gaze on Gu Qianxue before adding, “But I have a condition.”

As Gu Qianxue was distracted, Luo Tian pulled her into his arms. After all, she was his wife; it wasn’t truly a transgression.

“You…” Gu Qianxue’s eyes flashed with coldness, but she soon leaned into him, allowing his embrace.

“I need to know your past—everything!” Luo Tian whispered in her ear, their intimacy bordering on that of lovers.

“I? What’s there to know? Just the adopted daughter of the Snowfall City Lord,” Gu Qianxue replied, slightly uncomfortable with their intimacy. She gently pushed him away, still smiling.

“Still…” Luo Tian gazed at her, his voice resolute. He needed to uncover what had transpired to change Gu Qianxue so drastically.

“I don’t know my past,” Gu Qianxue spoke softly, recounting her story. “I awoke one day and was saved by the Snowfall City Lord in a snowy expanse. He had no children, so he adopted me. Later, I discovered my talent and was sent to the Tianlong Sect.”

“Yet when I saw you, a thought arose—kill you. Even now, I still harbor that urge, but I’ve suppressed it,” Gu Qianxue added, her voice tinged with confusion.

“Why?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his frustration mounting. His wife no longer recognized him and wished to kill him.

“Don’t know… but rest assured, I’d never harm you,” Gu Qianxue smiled radiantly, then sauntered away from Luo Tian.

“Such a girl!” Luo Tian sighed, watching her vanish into the distance. His gaze lingered on Gu Qianxue’s retreating form.

“Sigh…” He sighed again, walking toward the tomb’s exit. After days of solitude, he felt restless. The constant interaction with ghosts had left him with an eerie chill.

As he walked, sunlight gradually illuminated the path. Luo Tian’s face softened as he observed the bustling surroundings, his mood lifting.

After an hour of walking, Luo Tian finally exited the tomb’s boundaries, where the surroundings had grown lively.

The Tianlong Sect was vast, with tens of thousands of outer disciples alone. Outer disciples were the closest to secular life—mountains boasted food, drink, and entertainment. Occasionally, inner disciples and elders disguised themselves to visit the outer sect, for inner life offered little beyond cultivation and tasks.

“Truly lively,” Luo Tian mused as he entered a bustling market, the noise around him vibrant. His purpose here was not shopping but gathering intelligence about his enemies.

“Zhu Fengtian!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. Though Zhang Jinghuan had attacked him, he wasn’t certain if it was due to Zhu Fengtian. Still, he couldn’t ignore any clues.

As he walked, Luo Tian overheard a group of disciples discussing: “Hear that the top-ranked figures on the Tianlong Rankings have returned!”

“Indeed, it’s about time,” a burly man replied. “But I heard they all returned empty-handed. The ascended ones aren’t foolish—they can’t discern who’s genuine. Only Zhu Fengtian remains.”

“Such a task from the Immortal King! The Immortal King himself—finding those ascended ones would bring great rewards. Even if we enter the Middle Heavens, let alone the Upper Heavens, the Immortal King’s word would grant us entry!”

“Hence this mission is critical. Inner disciples have given their all, not just the Tianlong Sect but other sects and cities too seek these ascended ones.”

“After all, they are invincible in the world. We must find and capture them before they grow strong—otherwise, it’ll be too late, and they could bring trouble to the sects!”

Luo Tian’s face darkened. “Don’t expose us,” he thought, fearing for his friends’ safety. In the Nine Realms, they were masters, but in the Immortal Realm, they were barely more than ants.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian listened to the murmurs, a crimson streak of light shot across the sky, bold and arrogant.

“Who is that?” All eyes turned to the figure above. Only a select few in the Tianlong Sect dared such audacity.

“Fool! When I’m alive, I’ll dig up your ancestors’ graves!” a voice roared. The sound was eerily familiar to Luo Tian.

Dressed in crimson robes, the youth radiated a fiery aura. His red eyes glowed with power, and he held two figures by a rope—wounded, bloodied, barely alive.

“Zhu Fengtian! Third-ranked on the Tianlong Sect’s Inner Disciple Rankings, a Celestial Immortal at the intermediate stage!” The outer disciples recognized him instantly, awe in their eyes.

“Zhu Fengtian!” Luo Tian murmured the name under his breath, watching the figure vanish. His body trembled with cold intent.

“Yu Changtian!” Luo Tian thought, recognizing one of the two figures—his old friend Yu Changtian.

But what unsettled him more was the second figure: a rotund man, his friend Sun Kernen from the Nine Realms.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, stunned that Sun Kernen—so sharp-minded—had still been captured by Zhu Fengtian.

“What to do?” Luo Tian’s mind raced. If he exposed himself now, he’d be caught too.

The roars faded as Zhu Fengtian flew past the outer sect toward the Dragon Vein’s depths.

Luo Tian moved swiftly, following Zhu Fengtian into the inner sect. The crowd was astounded.

“Stop!” But as Luo Tian reached a mountain’s base, two voices barked at him. Two youths in earth-yellow robes stood before him, their faces sneering.

“Outer disciples are forbidden from entering the Thick Peak!” they declared coldly, blocking his path.

They were at the early Celestial Immortal stage, their gazes indifferent.

“Two elders, I have urgent matters to reach the Earth Peak. Please grant me passage,” Luo Tian requested softly, his gaze on Zhu Fengtian’s retreating form.

The Tianlong Sect had ten peaks, each guarded by a Grand Elder. The Earth Peak was where he needed to go—perhaps to gather information on Zhu Fengtian or attempt to retrieve Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian through Grand Elder Xue Changshan. After all, a Grand Elder could handle such matters more easily.

“Move aside! Thick Peak isn’t for you to enter!” one youth sneered, dismissing him.

Luo Tian’s expression darkened—not from their words but because Zhu Fengtian had vanished.

“I merely admire Zhu Fengtian’s prowess,” Luo Tian bowed respectfully. “I wish to witness his grandeur.”

“Another fool trying to flatter connections!” they mocked. “Look in the mirror—how dare you associate with Zhu Fengtian?”

“Hum…” As their words ended, Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He extended a green token from his sleeve, striking one youth’s face.

“Smack!” The sound echoed as the youth’s cheek swelled, blood and teeth spitting out.

“You dare strike me! An outer disciple striking an inner one—this is insubordination!” the youth roared, ignoring the token. His aura surged as he advanced.

“Don’t be reckless, San Chou!” his companion cautioned, retrieving the green token.

“What’s reckless about it? An outer disciple striking an inner one—this is suicide! I’ll break his legs!” San Chou lunged, brandishing a staff.

Golden light flashed; the staff’s wind howled as it met Luo Tian’s front. His eyes narrowed, and he seized the staff mid-air.

“Boom!” The staff was crushed in Luo Tian’s grip, San Chou’s face contorting.

As an inner disciple, San Chou was a Celestial Immortal at the early stage. Yet his furious strike had been halted by Luo Tian, leaving him shaken.

“Move aside!” Luo Tian coldly ordered, lifting San Chou and hurling him to the ground.

“You… you…” San Chou lay sprawled, stunned.

“Six! Look at him!” the other youth, Six, trembled, holding the green token reverently.

“What?” San Chou spat blood, his back feeling like a mountain. He saw Six’s token and realization dawned.

“Who disrespects authority?” Luo Tian’s icy voice echoed, his gaze piercing San Chou.

“San Chou… I didn’t recognize the disciple!” San Chou trembled, not expecting this youth to be a Grand Disciple.

“Damn it!” San Chou mentally cursed. Grand Disciples were few, all elders now. Eight Grand Elders.

“Why are you a Grand Disciple? Pretending to be an outer disciple?” San Chou’s frustration boiled. If he’d known, he’d never have dared.

“Not right! That’s the token of Pill Peak!” San Chou’s face paled. “This youth… this is Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple!”

“Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple? Who dares touch him?” San Chou’s mind reeled.

Luo Tian snatched the token, sighing inwardly at Xuan Dan’s foresight. He ignored San Chou and Six, striding toward the Thick Peak.

This time, he knew Xuan Dan’s token was effective. He leapt into the sky, a streak of light crossing the Thick Peak toward Zhu Fengtian’s domain.

The area was lively, disciples bowing respectfully to Zhu Fengtian.

“Zhu Senior Brother is truly formidable—capturing two ascended ones!” they murmured, curiosity in their eyes as they watched Zhu Fengtian bind Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian.

“Fool! Free me, and I’ll ascend to Celestial Immortal—then I’ll beat you into oblivion!” Sun Kernen roared.

“Silence!” A disciple barked, seeing Zhu Fengtian’s anger. He raised a hand to strike Sun Kernen.

“Hum…” As the hand neared Sun Kernen’s face, eight silver glints shot toward the disciple’s arm.

“Sealing Needles of Eight Gates!” Luo Tian’s most precise technique.

“Hmph,” Zhu Fengtian frowned, snatching the eight silver needles mid-air. He caught four but missed four, which pierced the disciple’s arm.

“Sss…” The disciple grimaced in pain.

“Who?” Zhu Fengtian’s eyes flashed coldly, scanning the sky as Luo Tian descended.

“Ordered by Xuan Dan to escort the ascended ones to Pill Peak!” Luo Tian announced, presenting the token. Zhu Fengtian’s eyes narrowed.

“Grand Disciple!” Zhu Fengtian’s gaze flickered, surprised Xuan Dan had taken a Grand Disciple.

“Crinkle…” Zhu Fengtian gripped the green token, his grip tight. Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple—Zhu Fengtian had long coveted this, so his gaze turned hostile.

“Unexpectedly, someone became Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple during my absence!” Zhu Fengtian mused, holding the token without returning it.

“Hmph…” Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian’s eyes lit up, surprised but unable to speak.

“Please, Zhu Senior Brother, hand over these two to me,” Luo Tian requested softly, subtly signaling Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian.

Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian—masters of the world—understood Luo Tian’s intent instantly. They remained silent.

“Want them?” Zhu Fengtian frowned, his gaze on Luo Tian before flashing murderous intent.

“What’s your name?” Zhu Fengtian asked, sensing the blood mist from Zhu Fenghuo. Though faint, it was unmistakable to Zhu Fenghuo. Only he and Zhu Fenghuo could detect it.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian’s heart tightened; Zhu Fengtian’s intent meant he knew Luo Tian had killed Zhu Fenghuo.

“Luo Tian?” The crowd murmured, turning to him. Though the entrance exam had passed, they still remembered his dazzling performance.

“Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple!” They gossiped, curious about Luo Tian’s rare appearances.

“Haha, Xuan Dan needs them—of course I can’t refuse!” Zhu Fengtian smiled, though he knew Luo Tian had killed Zhu Fenghuo. Yet he held back; even if he confronted him, it would be futile. Luo Tian was now Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple, and if he clashed with him, one day “accidentally” dying might implicate him.

Moreover, the Tianlong Sect forbade higher-ranked disciples from attacking lower ones without cause.

“Looks like this son also died at his hands!” Zhu Fengtian mused, eyeing Luo Tian. He sighed inwardly—this youth had skill. Bloodshed’s strength was known to him; even he would need effort to kill him.

“Then I’ll trouble you, Zhu Senior Brother!” Luo Tian smiled, not wanting to clash with Zhu Fengtian immediately. But he had to save Sun Kernen; delay was dangerous. He couldn’t afford to let Sun Kernen face more trouble, and using Xuan Dan’s token was now necessary.

As he approached Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian, Luo Tian smiled, kicking Sun Kernen’s plump back. “You’re lucky—Xuan Dan found you!”

He then unceremoniously snatched Sun Kernen’s ring, storing it.

“Hmph…” Sun Kernen’s face reddened, his expression like eating dirt as he glared at Luo Tian.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian pulled the rope, commanding Sun Kernen. He had to leave before exposing himself; otherwise, escape would be impossible.

“Luo Senior Disciple, did you forget something?” Zhu Fenghuo’s voice echoed behind him.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian turned, seeing Zhu Fengtian holding his Grand Disciple token.

“Almost forgot—thank you for returning the token!” Luo Tian smiled, approaching Zhu Fengtian.

“Take it,” Zhu Fengtian extended the token, his gaze still smiling.

“Thank you, Zhu Senior Brother!” Luo Tian smiled, reaching for the token. It was useful, and he hesitated to part with it.

“Why does Zhu Senior Brother seem hostile toward this Luo Tian?” The crowd observed their smiles, sensing only coldness.

As they gossiped, Luo Tian grasped Zhu Fengtian’s token but didn’t move. Zhu Fengtian hadn’t released it.

“Son, though I can’t kill you, I can humiliate this Grand Disciple. Let’s see what skills you have to earn it!” Zhu Fengtian sneered, sensing Luo Tian was a Celestial Immortal at the early stage. To him, even Grand Disciples were trash.

Luo Tian recognized Zhu Fengtian’s intent—his goal was to make Luo Tian look foolish.

“Let me also test Zhu Fengtian’s strength,” he thought, then gently pressed against Zhu Fengtian.

“Crinkle…” The sound of grinding echoed between them. Luo Tian’s arms bulged with veins, his gaze fixed on Zhu Fengtian.

“Such immense strength!” Zhu Fengtian marveled, gradually applying force.

“Forty percent… fifty…” He increased pressure, hoping to embarrass Luo Tian. But soon he was disappointed—his force had reached maximum, yet Luo Tian didn’t budge.

“Two are secretly competing!” The crowd, mostly Celestial Immortals at the intermediate stage, noticed their silent contest.

“This Luo Tian isn’t a fraud—matching Zhu Senior Brother’s strength!” They marveled, watching Luo Tian sweat.

“Indeed, Xuan Dan chose well,” Zhu Fengtian mused, but his desire to kill Luo Tian deepened. After all, Luo Tian must know he was Zhu Fenghuo’s brother.

“Need to find a way to eliminate him,” Zhu Fengtian thought, considering whether to kill Luo Tian here. Yet he dismissed the idea.

“Haha! Luo Senior Disciple truly is a dragon among men!” Zhu Fengtian laughed, releasing the token.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled heavily. Zhu Fengtian’s strength terrified him; though he could crush Celestial Immortals at the early stage, his gap against mid-stage masters was undeniable.

“Zhu Senior Brother smiled!” Luo Tian chuckled, then turned to lead Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian down the Thick Peak.

“Such a skillful actor!” Sun Kernen, bound and unable to speak, mentally cursed Luo Tian. Yet he followed obediently, sighing in relief at his safety.

“Haha! Fengtian Senior Brother, you’ve been deceived!” A loud laugh echoed from the sky. Green light flashed as a figure appeared.

“Zhao Ritian?” Zhu Fengtian’s gaze flickered, frowning. He and Zhao Ritian had clashed over Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple position.

“His identity as a Grand Disciple is fake—he only has a token!” Zhao Ritian declared, eyeing Luo Tian.

He then recounted the events to Zhu Fengtian, leaving everyone gasping. They stared at Luo Tian as if he were a fool.

“Disgraceful—refusing Xuan Dan’s Grand Disciple status!” They mocked.

“Pretending to be Xuan Dan’s disciple, trying to take the ascended ones—what are your intentions?” Zhu Fengtian roared, anger rising.

“Today I’ll capture you and report to Xuan Dan!” He extended a fiery hand toward Luo Tian.

“Can’t control yourself?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldness, a pressure radiating from Zhu Fengtian’s palm.

“Final Kill!” Zhu Fengtian unleashed his full strength, confident even a Celestial Immortal at the early stage would perish.

Luo Tian pushed Sun Kernen and Yu Changtian aside, his gaze fixed on the descending fiery palm.

Like a red-hot iron block, it descended like a volcano—heavy and scorching, shaking the heavens.

“Dao of Sealing Demons!” Luo Tian wasn’t a pushover; he fought with all his might to gauge the gap between himself and Zhu Fengtian.

“Zhu Fengtian Senior Brother intends to kill him!” The crowd gasped, their eyes wide. They weren’t blind; even they felt Zhu Fengtian’s palm would be deadly.

“He should be dead,” Zhao Ritian smirked, arms crossed, watching the fiery palm. A hint of fear flickered in his eyes.

“Boom!” The clash erupted, a thunderous sound echoing. Luo Tian spat blood, his fists trembling as he planted his feet into the ground. Yet his eyes held coldness.

“Not hurt?” The crowd stared, stunned. Though battered, Luo Tian had only sustained minor injuries.

“How could he withstand Zhu Fengtian’s full strength? He’s still a Celestial Immortal at the early stage!” They gasped.

“Daring to defy authority, resisting my capture!” Zhu Fengtian proclaimed, his voice resolute.

Zhu Fengtian was equally astonished—Luo Tian’s strength had surpassed his expectations. Yet this only solidified his resolve to kill him.

“Crash…” Flames erupted from Zhu Fengtian, surrounding him with fire. His palm descended again, more terrifying than before.

“Celestial Fire…” The crowd gasped. Even Zhao Ritian’s face showed admiration—Zhu Fengtian had subdued the Seven Stars Flame, securing his third rank on the Tianlong Rankings.

The fiery palm descended upon Luo Tian, who narrowed his eyes again. His spiritual energy surged as the Seven Colors Flame burned within him, consuming his spiritual energy.

“Open!” Luo Tian roared, leaping into the air. His burning spiritual energy formed seals on his arms, then he punched again.

“Crack!” Thunder echoed as the clash erupted. Luo Tian’s body crashed down, and Zhu Fengtian’s fiery palm exploded upon impact. Yet the red flames enveloped Luo Tian entirely.
