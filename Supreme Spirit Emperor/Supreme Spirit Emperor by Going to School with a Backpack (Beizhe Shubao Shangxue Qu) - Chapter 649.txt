The moment Du Jianxing, my master, had demonstrated the third level of Sword Dao to me, but at that time I could only achieve the state of unity between self and sword. I hadn't even entered the second level, so I couldn't comprehend it at all!" Luotian's mind kept recalling Du Jianxing's mighty five swords, which had nearly slain the Fire Sage. Now Luotian was at the second level of Sword Dao, having just begun to grasp its fundamentals. His use of the sword was no longer as awkward as before.

As he pondered, Luotian unexpectedly entered a state of unity between heaven and humanity. He closed his eyes, while the Dragon Abyss Sword in his hand continued to move.

"Unity of Heaven and Humanity!" Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo widened their eyes, watching Luotian with his eyes closed and the calm aura radiating from him.

"This level of insight is unparalleled!"

"He obtained the Ghost Valley Mandate not without reason. Even the great immortal kings in their youth couldn't reach such power!" Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo whispered to each other.

Time flowed slowly. Luotian kept repelling the sword qi with his eyes closed, and although his speed slowed, the sword qi striking him became fewer under Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo's astonished gazes.

"What have you领悟? So formidable?" They were puzzled. Yin Yitian, for the first time, showed a look of admiration toward Luotian. Originally, he had only obeyed Luotian due to the seed of demon heart, but his nature was defiant. He had some resentment toward Luotian.

Yet even Yin Yitian, on the altar, wouldn't have endured it. Moreover, Luotian's previous methods had made Yin Yitian believe in his limitless future.

Time flowed slowly. Luotian repelled one sword after another, entering a state of self-forgetfulness.

Thousand swords... Ten thousand swords... After half a day, Luotian had repelled the terrifying ten thousand swords. His body was no longer human-like; to comprehend sword intent, his body had been cut by the sword light, allowing him to perceive it through his body. Another quarter of an hour passed, and the boundless sword qi on the altar finally thinned to only a few remaining swords that drifted toward Luotian. Two beams of divine light flowed, and Luotian opened his eyes. Two sword glows surged within his eyes, while a sword intent arose from his body, echoing Dragon Abyss.

"The third realm of Sword Dao—no self, no sword. I understand now!" Luotian spoke softly, gripping Dragon Abyss and lightly swinging it.

"嗡……" A black sword glow shot out from the Dragon Abyss Sword, flying toward the ten remaining swords approaching Luotian.

In an instant, there was no sound of collision. The black sword glow merged with the invisible swords and then surged, radiating a terrifying aura before flying to Luotian's front.

"From now on, no one below the third level of Sword Dao can harm me!" Luotian murmured, pointing his finger.

"嗡……" That black sword glow pierced into Luotian's body. However, it seemed to pass through him, emerging from his back.

"Sword Dao has been broken! He had been cultivating sword intent and now reached the third realm!" Yin Yitian spoke, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Genius. The sword Dao of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King, none in this world can match him. These swords must contain the sword Dao of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King. Ten thousand and eight thousand swords—surely they would bring great rewards!" Tang Xinghuo's eyes showed admiration.

"Now, it's time to refine this wing!" Luotian smiled, stepping toward the black wing. Just as he took another step, a phoenix cry echoed again, making Luotian's face change.

"Again?" Luotian cursed inwardly. He had thought it was over, but there were still problems.

Luotian quickly took out pills to recover his injuries in case of any sudden situations. Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo observed Luotian carefully, for there was still an unseen enemy.

After waiting a while without any strange occurrences, Luotian felt puzzled. He cautiously approached the demon cloud wing and his hands flashed with waves of demonic energy, placing them on the demon cloud wing.

"嗡……" As Luotian placed his hand upon it, the demon cloud wing emitted waves of dark light. The phoenix cry echoed continuously in Luotian's ears, and the black feathers on the wing radiated waves of divine laws.

In an instant, Luotian's body trembled and froze in place. His spirit soul was absorbed by a massive force, as if entering another space.

In the dim space, violent energy raged. Luotian's gray spirit soul stood in the space.

"Finally someone has come!"

"I should thank you. If it weren't for you eliminating those swords, I wouldn't have been able to emerge!" A cold voice echoed in the space. A black figure appeared in Luotian's vision.

The black figure was immense, somewhat resembling a phoenix but without a tail. It had only three black feathers, like three sharp swords.

"Who are you?" Luotian furrowed his brows, sensing the spirit soul was very strong.

"Die! Fallen Heaven, you won't let me go until death. You wish to be enslaved again? That's too optimistic!" A mad voice rang out, and the black figure rushed toward Luotian.

"Must I also destroy this phoenix spirit soul?" Luotian muttered to himself. As he spoke, the massive figure had already reached Luotian's front, its black claws reaching for him.

"Controlling spirit souls is easier!" Luotian smiled, his soul master's aura bursting forth. He took a step forward and swung his gray spirit soul's fist toward the black phoenix soul.

"You..." The phoenix soul instantly felt Luotian's overwhelming aura, and his voice carried disbelief. Who was he? He had once been able to fight against the Fallen Heaven Immortal King. Although now only two wings remained, his soul was still powerful.

To make the phoenix spirit soul feel strong pressure and even have its strength weakened, it showed how powerful this soul master was to the spirit soul.

"Crack..." As the phoenix soul was shocked, Luotian's gray fist had already struck its two black claws.

Boom...

An invisible wave erupted from their collision, spreading outward.

Outside, Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo only saw Luotian standing still. Then a powerful soul force spread from his body, forming a storm around him.

"Little bird, don't you dare be refined by this soul master!" Luotian took two steps back, watching the phoenix spirit soul that had also been repelled. He laughed and rushed toward it.

"You're dreaming!" The phoenix soul shouted, though he was shocked by Luotian's strength. Still, he gritted his teeth and flew toward Luotian.

Chapter 2437: Refining the Wing()

On the black altar, Luotian stood there. However, storms continuously erupted from his body. The powerful soul force spilled out, making Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo's faces show shock at Luotian's soul strength.

In the dim space, Luotian continuously fought against the black phoenix spirit. Even though he was a soul master, he was pushed back by the powerful phoenix soul.

One person and one phoenix fought in this strange space, with dangerous battles. If one side failed, the final result would be soul destruction.

"Indeed, a phoenix spirit that made the Fallen Heaven Immortal King act. Even I, as a soul master, can withstand its pressure!" Luotian was amazed at the phoenix spirit's strength.

The phoenix cry echoed, and a brutal energy radiated from the black phoenix soul. With a roar, the phoenix spirit opened its mouth and shot a black lightning toward Luotian.

"However, little bird, you are destined to be subdued by me!" Luotian smiled. His soul force condensed into a gray soul sword, which landed in his hand.

"Crack..." The black lightning collided with the gray soul sword, again blocking Luotian's steps. At the same time, a gray sword glow flew out from his hand and slashed against the phoenix's massive body.

"Pu..." The gray sword glow was extremely powerful, slicing through the phoenix's body and causing large numbers of black feathers to disintegrate into soul force.

"What else do you have? If you follow me, perhaps you can prolong your life!" Luotian's aura was overwhelming. He continuously swung his soul sword, emitting a terrifying aura that combined with the soul master's immense pressure. They clashed repeatedly.

Boom boom boom...

The roaring sound continued, and the phoenix spirit showed no fear. The two began a bloody battle. Each of Luotian's swords annihilated much of the phoenix spirit's body, while the phoenix spirit's methods also drained Luotian's soul force.

"If it were anyone else, they would have already been defeated by you. Unfortunately, you met me!" Luotian continuously spoke, and it was destined that the phoenix spirit would be killed by him.

"This kid is truly a monster. A mere Immortal King's initial stage, yet he has such powerful soul strength. Moreover, the aura on his soul suppresses half my power!" The phoenix spirit felt委屈 in his heart. He had already used all his methods, but still couldn't defeat Luotian, which made him anxious. The phoenix spirit was an unusual beast and naturally proud. Even the true phoenix clan, he wouldn't look down on. A small Immortal King's initial stage like Luotian, he could have killed him with one breath. The phoenix spirit naturally didn't want to be enslaved by Luotian.

"Phoenix Wings Spread!" The phoenix spirit finally couldn't hold out. Though he felt委屈, as he fought with Luotian, he knew he wasn't Luotian's match. He roared and his massive body rose into the air.

The roaring sound shook all directions, and the space became even darker. Black energy radiated from the phoenix spirit's body, and its massive form transformed into a black cloud of clouds, pressing down with supreme power.

"Finally, he's using his real strength!" Luotian's eyes showed a slight seriousness. His gray soul sword suddenly surged, radiating an overwhelming sword intent that Luotian controlled and slashed downward.

The third level of Sword Dao—no self, no sword!

The terrifying sword intent of the third level fully manifested. The dim space changed color, and combined with Luotian's powerful soul force, it was enough to destroy any immortal soul.

"Where is he?" As Luotian swung his sword, the phoenix spirit that had transformed into a black cloud instantly lost perception of Luotian. In his perception, there was only one terrifying soul sword, radiating overwhelming power and rushing toward him.

The black cloud transformed into two black wings, flapping to move the sky and earth. A terrifying storm formed, with black lightning interwoven within it. Luotian's face changed as well, but he remained confident.

In an instant, the gray soul sword collided with the terrifying storm. A shocking scene appeared.

The gray soul sword was overwhelmingly strong, directly destroying the storm and slicing against the black wings.

The roaring sound spread everywhere. Luotian's gray soul, with a smile on his face, watched the phoenix spirit gradually regrouping. That one strike had cost Luotian three-tenths of his soul strength, but he could feel the phoenix spirit's exhaustion was greater than his. Now he could sense the phoenix spirit's weakness, and his soul master's aura was enough to crush the phoenix spirit.

"Come here, little bird!" Luotian laughed and extended his hand. A powerful suction force spread from his hand, and a gray storm quickly gathered in front of him. The phoenix spirit's black eyes showed fear.

"Are you ready to submit now?" Luotian sneered, looking at the illusory phoenix spirit. If it resisted again, he wouldn't advise sending it to the afterlife.

"Submissive... submissive..." The phoenix spirit was terrified. He had just revived, and he didn't want to be destroyed.

"Then don't resist!" Luotian smiled and began to place restrictions on the phoenix spirit. Just as he was placing the restrictions, the storm that had radiated from Luotian's body outside also calmed down. Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo sighed in relief.

However, just as they relaxed, a ghostly figure appeared behind Luotian, causing them to shout.

"Luotian, that thing has appeared again!" Tang Xinghuo shouted and immediately sent a团 of green fire from his hand toward the ghostly figure. The green flames were powerful, but the ghostly figure seemed unaffected. It extended its long tongue and wrapped around Luotian's neck, and the powerful flames passed through the figure, crashing into the palace wall.

"What's going on?" Luotian was currently subduing the phoenix spirit but felt a suffocating sensation. He suddenly opened his eyes.

"嗡……" His soul returned to his body, and Luotian's face changed abruptly. The suffocating sensation became stronger, as if a moist long snake was wrapped around his neck, making Luotian's face extremely unattractive.

"Taking advantage of my weakness?" Luotian realized, and he turned around. However, the ghostly figure moved with him, preventing Luotian from seeing its true form.

"Master, it's behind you! It ignores our attacks!" Tang Xinghuo shouted, his gaze on the ghostly figure floating behind Luotian.

"What is that thing?" Luotian shouted, and he reached back. However, the grotesque ghostly figure disappeared again at that moment. On Luotian's neck was a bruise, and a strange mark appeared on his neck.

A black mark, very noticeable. Luotian's mouth twitched, feeling it wasn't a good thing.

"What is this mark?" Luotian felt the coldness on his neck and cursed inwardly. His body had so many marks, including those from the Ghost Valley and this invisible thing.

"What is it? When did it follow me?" Luotian was puzzled, but since the ghostly figure didn't appear, he couldn't do anything about it.

"The demon cloud wing is just one of them. The other must be here!" Luotian muttered, grabbing the black demon cloud wing and beginning to refine it.

The humming echoed. As Luotian's refining power spread, the black demon cloud wing gradually shrank into a black ball, resembling a pill.

"Let me eat it?" Luotian's eyes showed confusion. Then he heard the phoenix spirit's definite response.

Luotian extended his hand and swallowed the black ball. At the moment he swallowed it, a series of roaring sounds spread from his body. Luotian could feel a powerful aura roaming within his body, eventually flowing into the meridians on his back.

"Ah..." Intense pain surged through Luotian's back. He felt that powerful aura breaking through his back meridians and growing on his back. Luotian hunched over, sweat flowing from his forehead, while Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo were shocked as they watched Luotian's back.

The phoenix cry echoed continuously. A black wing slowly unfolded on Luotian's back, stretching over ten feet long. The wings radiated waves of divine laws, giving a sense of awe.

"This..." As the black wing unfolded, a feeling of blood connection was instantly transmitted to Luotian's perception. That wing seemed like part of his body.

Luotian tried it, and the black wing slowly flapped. Instantly, it began to draw on Luotian's cultivation strength, a fierce power surging over the black wing.

"Whoa..." A storm swept through, instantly blowing against Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo. Yin Yitian was fine, but Tang Xinghuo's face changed slightly. He had to regulate his cultivation strength to withstand the wind.

"If he fully unleashed it, how far could an Immortal King's initial stage blow?" Luotian's eyes showed a smile, feeling the pain wasn't in vain.

The black wing slowly retracted. The only thing that made Luotian speechless was that he had wings on his back, and the character "Ghost Valley" still remained.

"Let's go. It's been hard on both of you. If there are resources, I'll send them to both of you!" Luotian spoke softly, not making it final.

The three took a step over the altar. A black passage appeared in their vision.

Precisely, it was a bridge, only about ten feet wide but unknown where it led. Below the bridge was an endless abyss, with no bottom visible. Only the sound of wind could be heard from below, radiating a cold atmosphere.

The three didn't dare to be careless. Since entering the Immortal Mountain, they had encountered events that could have taken their lives. Who knew what was on the bridge?

Luotian still stood at the front, while Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian stood behind him. They walked on the bridge. The only thing that made Luotian relieved was that the ghostly figure hadn't appeared again.

Chapter 2438: Wind Beast()

On the black bridge, three figures cautiously walked. The wind sounds continuously echoed from below, and a cold atmosphere spread over the three.

Ten feet... One hundred feet... Time flowed slowly. Only wind sounds were heard by them, and as they walked further, the wind became stronger.

The cold atmosphere grew stronger. The three's hearts were increasingly tense. After walking for nearly an hour, the wind was so strong it could tear through space. Even Luotian and his companions had to be careful, setting up a domain to prevent the spatial rifts from touching them. A domain was used to stabilize their surrounding space, preventing it from being torn by the terrifying hurricane.

"What's the end of this?" After walking another hour, the wind became stronger. Even their domains began to become unstable.

"This wind is strange!" As time passed, Yin Yitian stopped and spoke to Luotian and Tang Xinghuo. He was an Immortal King's middle stage, stronger than Luotian and Tang Xinghuo. He felt something was wrong.

"What's strange?" Luotian and Tang Xinghuo also stopped, looking at Yin Yitian.

"Have you felt it? This wind isn't just blowing the body but also affecting the soul, directly hitting the three souls and seven essences!" Yin Yitian spoke. He looked at the endless abyss.

"Ten Absolute Wind Beasts?" Tang Xinghuo, upon hearing Yin Yitian's words, showed a serious expression.

"Do you know about the Ten Absolute Wind Beasts?" Yin Yitian was surprised. The Ten Absolute Wind Beasts were almost unheard of, and the only possibility of producing such winds was a wind beast.

"Wind Beast?" Luotian recalled the records in the Classic of Mountains and Seas, also recalling the records about the Ten Absolute Wind Beasts.

"If there really is a wind beast, we've gained something. Its core is a precious item, comparable to an immortal medicine. Eyes, teeth—everything on it is valuable!" Yin Yitian spoke, his voice filled with excitement.

"Let's continue walking. If we find this thing, then it's settled!" Luotian spoke softly, knowing that Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo had become interested. Since entering the Immortal Mountain, they hadn't found anything yet.

"However, this wind beast can disrupt our domain. Obviously, it's not a pushover. If we really meet it, there might be a battle!" Yin Yitian spoke, being cautious.

As they walked further, the storm grew stronger. Their domains were eventually blown away, and their surroundings were filled with spatial rifts.

"Being able to blow away domains means it's at the Immortal King level!" Luotian muttered, being more cautious. This was the Immortal Mountain; they had survived until now, which was already very lucky.

Their speed gradually slowed. They constantly avoided spatial rifts while the storm battered their bodies, not only affecting their flesh but also their soul. It seemed to want to blow out their souls from their bodies.

At this level, their souls had already merged. However, the wind affected their soul, as if it wanted to split their three souls and seven essences again.

The pressure increased. Even Luotian's powerful soul was affected, let alone Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian. Especially Tang Xinghuo, his body began to tremble. The wind was too much for him to bear, and his soul also shook.

Luotian furrowed his brows. He waved his hands, and a series of gray soul seals flew out from his hands.

"Seal Soul!" The soul seals flapped and were imprinted on the three of them, stabilizing their souls.

"Thank you, master!" Tang Xinghuo spoke, his eyes showing respect toward Luotian.

"At least it keeps our souls from being blown away. As for the body, it's up to each of us. If you can't bear it, just say so!" Luotian spoke to the two, standing at the front. They followed closely behind him.

Every so often, they switched positions because they noticed that those in front could withstand the pressure of those behind, giving them time to rest. It was like how geese migrate in formation.

Time flowed slowly. Another three hours passed, and the terrifying wind blew against Luotian's body. He felt as if a heavy stone was pressing on his chest.

"How much longer is this?" Luotian didn't dare to speak, fearing he might not be able to hold on.

"Both of you push me forward. I can't take it anymore!" Luotian transmitted his thoughts to Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo.

At this point, no one could withstand the powerful pressure. So switching positions was of no use.

As soon as Luotian transmitted his thoughts, Tang Xinghuo in the middle placed his hands on Luotian's back and pushed him forward with all his strength.

"Don't hesitate to say if you can't take it!" Yin Yitian spoke, placing his hands on Tang Xinghuo's back.

With the two pushing him, Luotian felt much better. However, his body still felt like it was being cut by a knife, and he had to avoid the spatial rifts occasionally.

"Crack..." After another hour, Luotian finally couldn't take it. His body had many cracks, and blood flowed from the cracks but was instantly blown away by the hurricane.

"Smack..." The red blood splattered on Tang Xinghuo's face, making him look surprised. However, the wind was too fast and immediately blew away the blood on Tang Xinghuo's face.

"How much longer is this?" Luotian mentally shouted. He really couldn't take it anymore, and his wounds were getting worse from the hurricane.

"Is there no end?" Luotian was puzzled. They had walked for so long, but they still hadn't reached the end of this bridge.

"This abyss is the exit!" Luotian stopped, looking at the abyss below. If they continued walking down, they would definitely be blown to death!

"I think this bridge is a trick. The abyss below is the exit!" Luotian transmitted his thoughts to Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo.

"Yes, if we continue like this, we'll be blown to death. Let's take a risk and jump into the abyss!" Tang Xinghuo responded.

"I agree too!" Yin Yitian nodded. After all, it was better to take a risk than to be blown to death. According to their speed, they wouldn't reach the exit.

After a brief discussion, Luotian took out a rope and tied them together. Standing on the bridge, they jumped into the black abyss.

The wind became even more urgent, but it made Luotian's three faces show joy. Although the wind was stronger, when they jumped into the abyss, the surrounding scenery changed. It wasn't an endless abyss anymore but a valley.

In the valley stood a massive creature, hundreds of feet long. Its massive body filled the valley. It had green scales and eyes. Seeing Luotian's three, it showed fierce aggression.

"It's the Wind Beast!" The three instantly felt joy and exclaimed. They hadn't expected that this creature, which had made them so helpless, was right under their feet.

"Boom..." As they fell, a green tail swung toward them.

"Beast, I've found you!" Yin Yitian shouted. He felt this beast was only at the Immortal King's initial stage. He waved his hands.

A golden long sword appeared in Yin Yitian's hand. The blade extended, cutting through the hurricane and rushing toward the thick tail.

The golden sword light cut through the hurricane and directly struck the beast's tail. The powerful sword light severed the long tail, and Yin Yitian was pushed back by that force.

"Such a lowly Immortal King's beast made us so helpless. You're the first one!" Luotian showed admiration, looking at the fierce creature.

"Roar..." The beast roared in pain. After Yin Yitian severed its tail, the fierce hurricane also weakened.

The third level of Sword Dao was activated. The black Dragon Abyss Sword was summoned by Luotian, and the black sword light fell from the sky, directly striking the massive body.

Boom...

"Damn it! Finally found the real one!" Tang Xinghuo also cursed, and a fire sword appeared in his hand. He continuously attacked.

The beast was fierce but only at the Immortal King's initial stage. If it weren't for Luotian's three not knowing they had jumped into the abyss, they might have been tricked to death by this wind beast.

However, once their hiding place was exposed, it was easy for Luotian's three to kill it. Luotian's three continuously attacked, and due to the previous wind beast almost blowing them to death, they were filled with resentment. In a roar, the entire valley was destroyed by Luotian's three, and along with it, the massive body was also destroyed.

Roaring sounds echoed. Blood mist rose. Luotian's three watched the destroyed wind beast, feeling a slight fear.

"Did we destroy everything?" Luotian spoke softly. After the dust settled, they landed on the ground. Scanning their surroundings with their spiritual senses, they felt regret for destroying this giant.

"Core, eyes... teeth..." As soon as he landed on the ground, Luotian's face showed joy. He quickly started collecting items from the wind beast's body.

In a moment, many parts of the wind beast appeared before Luotian. Especially that green core and two green eyes, which were obviously not ordinary.

"I'll give them to you. I've always kept my word. But the two of you must divide it well!" Luotian spoke softly, giving all these things to Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo.

"Thank you, master!" Upon hearing Luotian's words, Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo showed gratitude. These things were definitely not ordinary.

They began to divide the wind beast, and after a brief argument, Tang Xinghuo was eventually subdued by Yin Yitian. They ended the division, and Luotian's injuries were also completed. The two came to Luotian's front. Tang Xinghuo wore a sycophantic smile.

Chapter 2439: The Fallen Heaven Immortal King's Legacy()

"Master, I saw you use an eye technique before. I'll give these two eyes of the wind beast to you!" Tang Xinghuo approached Luotian, although Luotian said he didn't want it. They couldn't eat everything themselves. After discussing, they decided to give the two eyes of the wind beast to Luotian.

"Kind of you!" Luotian didn't refuse. He knew it was their sincerity. If he refused, Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo might feel uncomfortable.

Luotian took the two green eyes, his gaze showing a smile. He looked at a black hole above them. The black bridge had already disappeared.

Luotian and the two adjusted their states, rested for an hour, then stepped into the black hole.

"嗡……" As Luotian's foot touched it, a transmission force suddenly arrived. Before he could react, his surroundings twisted.

"Another transmission!" Luotian's heart pounded. He instinctively felt something was wrong, but he couldn't do anything about it.

How long they were transmitted, Luotian suddenly felt his feet go empty. A terrifying aura instantly filled his perception.

In front of him, countless sharp swords were inserted, their tips pointing at Luotian, radiating waves of coldness.

"This is terrible!" Luotian's face changed instantly. However, he wasn't too worried. As long as he didn't fall on them, they couldn't harm him.

A domain force suddenly spread out. He turned his body upright but was immediately pressed down by a suppressing force, making his body suddenly heavy.

"Damn it!" Luotian cursed. He couldn't fly anymore. His only hope was that his body was strong enough to not be pierced like a porcupine.

"Crack..." In an instant, Luotian's feet stepped on two sword tips. The sharpness instantly pierced his soles but didn't pierce through, only breaking a little skin.

"Ah..." Even so, Luotian felt pain and took a breath. Blood flowed down the sword tips. He saw the surrounding scene.

An endless array of sharp swords surrounded a black and white platform. On top of the platform, a ghostly figure sat in meditation, radiating an authoritative aura.

"Fallen Heaven Immortal King!" Luotian exclaimed. He immediately recognized the ghostly figure.

The ghostly figure of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King was enclosed in a barrier. Outside the barrier, continuous roaring sounds were heard. Due to the collision sounds on the other side, Luotian could only see a few figures exchanging blows. It was clearly a battle.

"Master!" As Luotian observed, Tang Xinghuo's voice echoed from the distance. It made Luotian turn his gaze to Tang Xinghuo's direction.

Tang Xinghuo's face was pale. His soles were half-pierced, obviously not as strong as Luotian's body.

Luotian's mouth twitched. He saw the sword forest had many skeletons and a few fresh corpses, obviously just died.

"Bad luck!" Luotian muttered inwardly. He also noticed that Yin Yitian was standing on the sword forest.

Yin Yitian's state was much better than Tang Xinghuo. Even better than Luotian, he stood on the sword forest with a puzzled expression.

"Someone is attacking one person!" Yin Yitian shouted, looking at the battle with a serious expression.

"Who is it? Do you know?" Luotian furrowed his brows. Now with Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, he wasn't afraid of anyone.

"Five people in total. Four are attacking one!" Yin Yitian spoke, and their conversation also caught the attention of those fighting.

"Boom..." Taking advantage of the four attackers' momentary distraction, a figure holding a lightning sword rushed into the barrier.

"Senior Brother!" Luotian exclaimed. He saw the disheveled person, who was none other than his senior brother, Zhang Ziping.

Luotian hadn't expected to meet Zhang Ziping here. After all, this was the Immortal Mountain, not the Heaven-Heaven Mountain.

However, Zhang Ziping inside the barrier didn't see Luotian. He held a lightning sword and merged with the ghostly figure of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King.

"Damn it, he escaped!" As Zhang Ziping merged with the ghostly figure of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King, the four attackers looked regretful.

They had arrived earlier and knew that the ghostly figure of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King was a legacy. They didn't know what kind of legacy it was. The barrier could not be entered. At that time, Zhang Ziping appeared and held the Heaven-Heaven Lightning Sword, a sacred item of the Heaven-Heaven Sect. They naturally fought for it because the Heaven-Heaven Lightning Sword was a sacred item of the Heaven-Heaven Sect. The Fallen Heaven Immortal King had been the peak immortal king of the Heaven-Heaven Mountain. With the Heaven-Heaven Lightning Sword in this legacy, he would definitely gain a significant advantage.

However, Zhang Ziping was extremely strong. They had attacked him and still couldn't defeat him. Instead, he took the opportunity to escape into the barrier.

The four attackers surrounded the barrier and watched Zhang Ziping merge with the ghostly figure of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King. Their faces were grim.

"I said the Heaven-Heaven Lightning Sword was the key to entering this barrier!" One old man with a knife scar on his forehead spoke.

"Xuanshan Four Elders!" Yin Yitian transmitted to Luotian, introducing the four.

"Another one came? Let's join forces and maybe we can break through the barrier together!" One old man spoke, his aura showing that he was at the middle stage of Immortal King.

"Killing Life Elder Yin Yitian!" Then, they saw Yin Yitian walking on the sword tips. Their eyes showed seriousness. Clearly, Yin Yitian had a big reputation in the Upper Three Heavens.

Similarly, the Xuanshan Four Elders had a big reputation in the Upper Three Heavens. The four brothers were sworn together, occupied Xuanshan, and became wandering cultivators. Three of them were at the initial stage of Immortal King, one was at the middle stage. They were targets for several major sects to recruit.

"Luotian!" Then the four saw Luotian walking toward the platform as well. Their eyes showed joy.

"We didn't expect to meet this kid. It's a blessing for the Xuanshan Four Elders!"

"Compared to the Ghost Valley legacy, what is the Fallen Heaven Immortal King's legacy?" One old man spoke. He bypassed the barrier and approached Luotian.

"Yin Yitian, are you willing to cooperate with us?" The eldest of the Xuanshan Four Elders, a middle-stage Immortal King, spoke.

"First go up!" Yin Yitian furrowed his brows. He understood the four's intentions from their greedy gazes toward Luotian. He lightly stepped and quickly rushed toward the platform.

"Kill him, the Ghost Valley Mandate is ours! Then we each control a part of the Ghost Valley Mandate!" The eldest of the Xuanshan Four Elders spoke. His hands moved, and in an instant, a golden hand appeared, pressing toward Luotian's direction.
