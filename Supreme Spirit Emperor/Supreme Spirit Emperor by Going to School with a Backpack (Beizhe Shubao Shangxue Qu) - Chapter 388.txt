Four statues, modeled after Zhang Daotian and his three companions in life, mirrored their height and all other features precisely. Yet now, as Luo Tian gazed upon these four stone effigies, they exuded an added aura of spiritual essence. If their skin tone were that of living flesh, they would seem like the four men reborn.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian's eyes bore a look of bewilderment. His vast spiritual awareness radiated from his body, instantly surging into the four stone figures.

"It has truly given birth to a true spirit!" Luo Tian's heart surged with waves of astonishment. Within his spiritual awareness, four intangible essences flickered within the statues. Though ephemeral, Luo Tian was certain these were spiritual soul forces.

"Three years ago, sometimes the statues would emit tremors as if striving to break free from their stone confines. Yet they eventually fell silent," Zhang Ziming said, his face alight with anticipation as he addressed Luo Tian.

"I don't know what this means," Luo Tian replied, "but this change clearly indicates a positive direction. A spiritual soul force has taken root within the stone, and perhaps they truly will awaken."

"As for whether these four spiritual essences are their souls, I'm uncertain. But they must be intricately connected to the four men, for I sensed familiar and comforting energies within them," Luo Tian murmured. All present exchanged glances, their faces etched with disbelief.

Especially among the people of Tianyuan Continent, who had witnessed the four men's self-sacrifice and dissolution into oblivion. Now Luo Tian claimed they might awaken—beyond their comprehension.

"Indeed, anything can happen in this world," Zheng Xin sighed, gazing at the lifelike stone figures.

"Exactly how did this happen?" Soon after, people's minds filled with questions, their gazes turning to Luo Tian for answers.

"They seem to have lived a second life!" Luo Xiting stood beside Jiang Sizhi, her eyes wide with disbelief as she addressed the stone figures.

"A second life!" Upon hearing Luo Xiting's words, everyone involuntarily inhaled sharply, their hearts tightening.

Living a second life was an achievement only the Epoch Masters could accomplish. Though it seemed simple, throughout history, those who achieved this were individuals of immense perseverance. Once successful, they inevitably became titans of power. The most notable example was Gu Tianshu.

"Master Gu's cultivation back then was at the middle Epoch stage. After self-annihilation, he lived a second life. But what was Zhang Daotian's cultivation back then? Only a World尊. Though they seemed powerful, now it appears that the strength of a World尊 could never allow one to live a second life," people murmured in confusion.

"Back then, when Master Gu self-annihilated, I was present. At that time, he was already at his limit. After self-annihilation, for a while I even thought he had perished. But in the end, he revived," Luo Xiting spoke softly. Among those present, only she had some understanding of living a second life, aside from Gu Tianshu.

"If they truly live a second life, there must be someone extraordinary among them. Their influence on the other three allowed all four to live a second life."

"But I only sense they resemble our ancestors. As for specifics, I'm unsure," Luo Xiting said.

"If these four truly awaken, it would be a blessing for the Tianyuan Continent. Yet we don't know what level their cultivation might reach," people murmured, faces alight with anticipation.

"It certainly won't be ordinary," Luo Xiting smiled. Though she had never met them, she'd heard their stories.

"Regardless, from today on, assign people to protect them. If they truly awaken, they might become our greatest secret weapon within the Four Sacred Star Domains," Luo Tian smiled, addressing everyone.

"No need. My three brothers and I will protect them here. I haven't told you yet—here, if one stays long enough, the four statues will emit divine voices. If one cultivates them, it would greatly benefit their cultivation," Zhang Ziping chuckled.

"You can sit here when you have time. But the divine voices are unpredictable, so it's all about luck," Zhang Ziping added.

"Amazing! I never expected our four elders to possess such a treasure!" Xu Liziyi and others sighed, their gazes respectful as they stared at the towering stone figures.

"Everyone, disperse. Those who wish to wait for the divine voices may stay, but don't disturb the ancestors," Luo Tian addressed them, his voice laced with excitement.

"I'll stay," someone finally said. Others sat cross-legged beneath the statues, waiting patiently.

"So will I!" Xu Liziye and Zheng Xin also sat cross-legged there, beginning their long wait.

Luo Tian watched them sit, then shook his head lightly. He knew that with their personalities, if they didn't get results in a day, they wouldn't continue waiting.

"Luo Tian, when are you leaving? When you go to the Fire Domain, we'll accompany you. It's quite boring here," Xu Liziye said, watching Luo Tian still standing there.

"Where is Zhan Biao?" Luo Tian ignored their words, instead inquiring about Chen Zhanbiao's whereabouts. Everyone's faces lit up with smiles.

After the great battle, Chen Zhanbiao's bloodline had fully awakened. His cultivation soared to the peak of the Epoch, and he shattered a royal son of an ancient king. Yet Chen Zhanbiao's identity was fully revealed—son of the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan) Divine Ancestor.

"That boy has been in seclusion these past days. His identity is somewhat sensitive, so we didn't let him appear often," Xu Liziye said softly. The survival of the ancient kings among humans was still inconvenient, as humans also harbored hatred toward them.

"I'll go check on him. Perhaps he has a way to remove the curse from me," Luo Tian chuckled, leaving without anyone accompanying him. He flew toward the place Xu Liziye had indicated.

In an instant, Luo Tian arrived at a vast courtyard. A tall old man sat there solemnly—Shi Changshan, the elder of the Stone Clan who had journeyed from the Origin Domain with the Seven Star Island.

"Respected elder!" Luo Tian bowed slightly to Shi Changshan, then gazed into the courtyard and asked softly: "Is Zhanbiao well?"

"Big brother, you're here!" As Luo Tian's words finished, a hearty laugh echoed from within the room. Chen Zhanbiao emerged with his towering frame, eyes filled with joy.

Chapter 1540: The Method to Break the Curse

Luo Tian observed Chen Zhanbiao's towering figure, a smile forming in his eyes. He stepped forward and lightly patted Chen Zhanbiao's shoulder: "You've grown even stronger!"

"Big brother, let me go out for a walk. I'm about to suffocate here!" Chen Zhanbiao grinned, addressing Luo Tian.

"How has your strength increased? Has it changed compared to before?" Luo Tian asked. Though Chen Zhanbiao's bloodline had fully awakened, Luo Tian was concerned about whether he'd changed too much or become someone else.

"No. My mind just has more things now! But some I still don't understand," Chen Zhanbiao scratched his head, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Ah, just digest it yourself. Are you bored here?" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao beside Shi Changshan. Now both men had changed significantly—no longer the towering figures of the Barbarian Clan. Their appearances were indistinguishable from humans, merely taller. Evidently, Chen Zhanbiao had acquired many techniques.

"Come with me this time," Luo Tian said softly, knowing Chen Zhanbiao was indeed bored.

"Really?" Chen Zhanbiao shook his head, still the same foolishly happy look. His face lit up with joy.

"Of course it's real. When have I ever lied to you?" Luo Tian nodded, then said: "Also, do you know a way to break the Barbarian Clan's curse? My brother has been enduring it constantly!"

"Barbarian Clan curse!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Chen Zhanbiao's face shifted slightly. His brows furrowed as he paced around, as if thinking about something.

"Curse-Breaking Pills!" Chen Zhanbiao muttered softly, then slapped his head and said to Luo Tian: "Big brother, I don't know how to break this curse. But my mind has some formulas I can't understand. Perhaps they'll help you!"

"Body-Refining Elixir... Soul-Eating Formula..." Chen Zhanbiao continued speaking, a string of ancient formulas spilling from his mouth. These fell upon Luo Tian's ears, making his face grow serious.

Though Luo Tian's current alchemy mastery was among the top in nine domains, he still found these ancient Barbarian Clan formulas intriguing.

Luo Tian meticulously recorded the formulas Chen Zhanbiao spoke, then carefully sifted through them. Finally, he selected one that could counteract the curse.

"Soul-Eating Elixir!" Luo Tian whispered, his eyes gleaming with a spark of light. He gazed at Chen Zhanbiao and chuckled.

"Zhanbiao, you've truly helped me big brother!" Luo Tian patted Chen Zhanbiao's shoulder heavily, his face alight with joy.

The Soul-Eating Elixir was named for its ability to devour souls, but it was crafted with five extremely cold main ingredients and some auxiliary herbs. It used the power of extreme cold to counteract the curse on the soul.

Yet it carried great risks. If mishandled, it might permanently freeze the soul. Hence its name: Soul-Eating Elixir.

"There's a way now, so it's manageable!" Luo Tian smiled, clenching his fists. Finding a solution to the curse thrilled him—enduring pain constantly, even with strong willpower, had its limits.

"Freezing Heart Ice... Ice玄 Flower... Dragon Mist Ice..." However, Luo Tian's lips twitched as he thought of the five main ingredients for the Soul-Eating Elixir. His eyes flashed with a bitter smile.

Five main ingredients, all of the Holy Medicine level. Though Luo Tian had some now, these five were extremely rare. Finding them would require considerable effort.

"Truly ancient formulas! If a regular alchemist had heard of these five ingredients, they might not have known them," Luo Tian muttered softly, then sighed.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian addressed Chen Zhanbiao and Shi Changming, saying: "Respected elder, I'll take my leave now."

"Master Luo..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's departure, Shi Changming hurriedly spoke but hesitated.

"Respected elder, please speak freely!" Luo Tian's face bore confusion. He couldn't fathom what Shi Changming might need.

"Please take care of my clan's Divine Ancestor's child! If you have time, let him return to the Barbarian Clan. Perhaps he could persuade them not to fight against humans. After all, a royal son holds high status among clans," Shi Changming spoke softly.

Though Shi Changming had been expelled from the Barbarian Clan, his blood still carried their heritage. He didn't want to see them at war with humans.

"Ah!" Luo Tian nodded. He also knew that Chen Zhanbiao's relationship might help reconcile humans and the Barbarian Clan. If managed well, it could be a great asset.

After speaking, Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao returned to the grand hall. As soon as they appeared, the hall erupted in noise.

"Zhanbiao has emerged from seclusion!" Xu Liziye and Zheng Xin immediately surrounded them, closely observing Chen Zhanbiao. Seeing he was still the same person, they became excited. They had indeed feared that awakening his bloodline might turn him into another person.

"Food!" Chen Zhanbiao pushed everyone aside, as if he hadn't eaten in years. His eyes turned green upon seeing the food on the table. He walked over and began devouring it, causing everyone to laugh.

"Did you find a way to break the curse?" Soon after, Luo Xiong and others asked Luo Tian.

"There's a hint," Luo Tian replied. He recounted the story of the Soul-Eating Elixir to everyone. Upon hearing that the main ingredients were so rare, their brows furrowed slightly.

"Let's search! With our current strength, if they exist, we'll find them!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing everyone.

"Yes! It's just a few Holy Medicines. Not that hard to find. From today on, everyone stop idling and go out searching! We'll scour the nine domains to find these five Holy Medicines!" Everyone then began bustling.

"Let's first discuss the current state of the nine domains," Luo Tian addressed Luo Xiong and Jiang Nanxuan. Compared to Xu Liziye and Zheng Xin, he trusted Jiang Nanxuan more.

"Currently, our Tianyuan Continent has become a power surpassing the Holy Domains. No Holy Domain can match us," Jiang Nanxuan said. Without Luo Tian, he was the external representative of the Tianyuan Continent and knew much.

"Ah!" Luo Tian nodded, confirming his suspicions. He gestured for Jiang Nanxuan to continue.

"However, this doesn't include the situation with the Epoch Masters' offspring. As each Holy Domain's Epoch Master's child awakens, their strength has greatly increased," Jiang Nanxuan knew what Luo Tian wanted to hear and immediately delved into the topic.

"Zhong Zixuan and Xuanhuang Qiong have disappeared from people's sight since that battle. We don't know their current strength."

"The Epoch Master's offspring of the Divine Clan is Sun Qianfeng, who awoke ten years ago. Yet he has never appeared in people's sight,"

"The Epoch Master's offspring of the Demon Clan is Beigong Cheng. His weapon is a Demon Mortal Sword. I don't need to explain his cultivation. However, the Divine Clan and Demon Clan had close relations in the old days. Thus, Beigong Cheng and Sun Qianfeng's relationship is close, easing the tension between the Demon Clan and Divine Clan. It seems they're on a path to unity," Jiang Nanxuan sighed softly.

"What about Nan Gong Yuching's status within the Demon Clan?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, thinking of Nan Gong Yuching's situation.

"Don't worry. Nan Gong Xiong's current cultivation is also at the peak of the Epoch, and his prestige isn't much different from Beigong Cheng's," Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly.

"The one who awoke in the Shura Domain is Run Hongyu. He once fought against the offspring of the Beast Clan's Epoch Master, and they were evenly matched,"

"As for who awoke in the Starry Domain, we don't know. As for the Chaos Domain, you already know about Zhuge Qingtian," Jiang Nanxuan quickly listed all the Epoch Master's offspring of each Holy Domain.

"By the way, the Fire Domain also produced one. However, it's not a man but a woman named Meng Xue. We've only heard of her and haven't seen her face," Jiang Nanxuan added.

"Did the Fire Domain's Epoch Master also leave a bloodline?" Luo Tian raised his brows slightly. He hadn't expected to see the Fire Domain's Epoch Master's offspring.

"As for the Thunder Domain... we don't know. After all, it's currently occupied by the Ancient Kings," Jiang Nanxuan sighed.

"Their exact strength is unknown, but as descendants of the Epoch Masters, they are certainly not weak. Each possesses the potential to become invincible,"

"Moreover, our peers have also advanced rapidly. Many have reached the peak of the Epoch," Jiang Nanxuan added, making Luo Tian sigh deeply.

"It's truly an unprecedented era!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He clenched his fists, eyes filled with battle intent. His blood began to boil, sensing that the next century would be very exciting.

"It's truly an era. So many prodigies, offspring of the Divine and Epoch Masters appearing simultaneously—this has never happened before. And this is only what we've found out. Whether there are more, it's hard to say," Jiang Nanxuan sighed softly, feeling the immense pressure.

"Who will take that final step in this unprecedented era?" Luo Tian spoke softly. Even he couldn't determine whether he would take that step among so many prodigies.

"As for the next steps, let's go one at a time. The immediate priority is to restore Xingxuan," Luo Tian muttered, then addressed everyone.

"I'm going to visit the Ancestor. You all go about your own business," Luo Tian smiled, not taking anyone with him—only Chen Zhanbiao and Sun Mengru.

Chapter 1541: Bonesilk Bamboo

Under the tranquil stars, Luo Tian and his two companions walked slowly. Yet their pace was not slow; each step covered a hundred miles.

"Finally out! I almost suffocated!" Chen Zhanbiao shouted constantly, taking large steps with Luo Tian and Sun Mengru toward the Fire Domain.

Along the way, they encountered many people from the Four Sacred Star Domains. Upon seeing Luo Tian, everyone showed respect. Though Luo Tian hadn't appeared for over twenty years, people knew about the death of the冥域 (Nether Domain) Divine Ancestor. Now that Luo Tian had appeared in the Four Sacred Star Domains, those with intent could guess the reason.

Luo Tian was now a godlike figure in the eyes of people from the Four Sacred Star Domains. Along the way, many bowed to him.

Luo Tian responded constantly. The three of them soon arrived at the endless fire sea, entering it. Under Xiaoqi's guidance, they entered the small world where Gu Tianshu resided.

"Respectful greetings to the Ancestor!" The three saw Gu Tianshu seated under the stars, his calm aura radiating from him.

"You've returned?" Gu Tianshu slowly opened his eyes, gazing at the three before him with a satisfied expression.

"You young people are almost catching up to us," Gu Tianshu smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

"Ancestor, you've lived a second life. Perhaps you can also attain the Dao," Luo Tian spoke softly, showing respect.

"We probably won't take that path. It's a natural cycle of old and new," Gu Tianshu replied softly.

"What did you come for?" Gu Tianshu didn't let Luo Tian continue, asking directly.

"Ancestor, is there a way to restore the one who used the forbidden technique?" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, indicating Sun Mengru.

"Buzz..." The gray Qiandun Tower flew out from Sun Mengru's hands. Then, the figures of Fu Xingxuan and Xiao Gan appeared in the small world's starry sky, making Gu Tianshu's eyes flicker with surprise.

"A living immortal herb that has taken human form?" Gu Tianshu sighed, gazing at Xiao Gan's body before seeing Fu Xingxuan accompanying him.

"Forbidden technique!" Gu Tianshu, with his discernment, instantly recognized Fu Xingxuan's condition. He softly uttered the two words, his brows furrowing slightly.

"If I had done it just now, I might have had a way. But it's been too long; I can't help," Gu Tianshu sighed, shaking his head and gazing at Luo Tian.

"Alas..." Though prepared, Luo Tian still felt disappointed. His eyes softened, gazing at Fu Xingxuan with disappointment.

"Don't worry. Even if there's no way, I won't let you die!" Luo Tian's face was resolute. He gazed at Fu Xingxuan as if making a promise.

"Attaining the Dao!" This was Luo Tian's last hope. If even Gu Tianshu couldn't help, then Luo Tian had lost all hope. The only way was to attain the Dao.

"I can contact Master Ji Jiuyou and Dongbo. They've seen much. Perhaps they have a way," Gu Tianshu said, extending his hand. Two black flames flew out from his hands, slicing through the stars and exiting the small world.

"Yes! Master Ji Jiuyou, this living fossil might have a way!" Gu Tianshu's words made Luo Tian's eyes flicker with light again.

"However, don't get too hopeful. Using a forbidden technique is a death trap. Her current state is entirely due to your soul force replenishing her and the nurturing of this immortal herb. If there's even a slight mistake, she still can't escape," Gu Tianshu spoke softly, observing Luo Tian's determination.

"The only way might be for you to attain the Dao. But attaining the Dao is your own path. If your soul force is incomplete, how can you take that step?" Gu Tianshu gazed seriously at Luo Tian. Concerning Luo Tian's future, he had to remind him.

Upon hearing Gu Tianshu's words, Luo Tian fell silent. He naturally understood what Gu Tianshu meant—that perhaps Fu Xingxuan couldn't be restored. And if this continued, he himself wouldn't be able to attain the Dao.

"Luo Tian, give up. I don't need you to waste your soul force anymore. I feel I can still accompany you for a while. I'm content," Fu Xingxuan smiled, having already accepted death when she shielded Luo Tian from the fatal strike. She was essentially a dead person.

"Don't say nonsense. If I can't attain the Dao, let those around me do it. It's still possible to restore you! Mengru can also attain the Dao!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Fu Xingxuan.

"Yes! Xingxuan, don't think too much. If Luo Tian can't help you, I will!" Sun Mengru's eyes glowed with gold, her face resolute.

"Don't be too pessimistic. Nothing in the world is absolute. I'm just telling you the worst-case scenario," Gu Tianshu nodded, gazing at Luo Tian with satisfaction.

Since ancient times, countless people have sought to attain the Dao, even if it meant betraying family. But Luo Tian did so for a woman, giving up his chance. This was definitely a display of deep feelings. Gu Tianshu valued this most about Luo Tian. With his talent and strength, the chances of Luo Tian attaining the Dao were great.

"Ancestor, I also want to ask about the second life. I have four elders who seem to have lived a second life, but I'm unsure. So I came to ask you," Luo Tian spoke again, recounting the situation of Zhang Daotian and his three companions. Gu Tianshu was also amazed.

"If what you said is true, then your four elders' situation indeed indicates they've lived a second life," Gu Tianshu spoke softly, his voice carrying a hint of amusement.

"I was at my limit then. I self-annihilated, giving birth to a second life. It was only by placing myself in death that I survived,"

"Their way of living a second life is clearly different from mine. Therefore, I'm unsure. But people's fates are different. As Xiting said, perhaps there really is someone extraordinary among them,"

"I'll go to the Four Sacred Star Domains later," Gu Tianshu said, his face showing a hint of interest.

"Indeed, there must be someone extraordinary among them," Gu Tianshu's words had just finished when a deep voice echoed in the small world's starry sky.

Ji Jiuyou still wore his beggar-like attire, holding that iconic broken sail. He appeared in the sight of Luo Tian and others.

"Sorry I'm late!" Ji Jiuyou had just appeared when Dongbo Xin, with his mighty aura, stepped into the small world from the fire sea.

"Respectful greetings to both elders!" Luo Tian showed respect, bowing to Ji Jiuyou and Dongbo Xin. Sun Mengru also bowed slightly.

"Don't be polite!" Dongbo Xin spoke softly, then gazed at Gu Tianshu: "What's the matter? Why did you call us so urgently?"

"Look at this. Is there a way to save her?" Gu Tianshu, seeing Luo Tian's anxious expression, didn't waste words. He pointed at Fu Xingxuan's drifting soul and asked the two.

"Used a forbidden technique?" Dongbo Xin looked at Fu Xingxuan, then shook his head.

Luo Tian's heart sank again. He turned to the last hope—Ji Jiuyou, the living fossil.

"Hey, you've got a good fortune!" Ji Jiuyou, though ancient and frail, had strong vitality. He circled Fu Xingxuan twice before looking at Luo Tian with a smirk.

"Master, don't keep me waiting. Can she be saved? Back then I was wrong, but I didn't know it was you!"

"Master, now if you just nod, I'll kneel and become your disciple immediately!" Luo Tian's face bore a pained expression. He thought back to their previous meeting with Ji Jiuyou, which had been awkward.

"Kid, I was eager to take you as my disciple before. You didn't want it. Now you want to be my disciple again? Daydreaming!"

"But since you have a son who inherits my teachings, I can help. However, I've never done anything for nothing. You must do me a favor!" Ji Jiuyou smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

"Can be saved!" Upon hearing Ji Jiuyou's words, Luo Tian, Sun Mengru, and Fu Xingxuan all trembled.

"Master, please speak clearly! I'll do my best!" Luo Tian bowed immediately, his eyes full of respect.

"Indeed, the old immortal's talent is unmatched. He can save this!" Dongbo Xin stood there, muttering inwardly.

"Saving him is simple. One is to attain the Dao, using the supreme methods of an Epoch Master to remove the backlash from the forbidden technique!"

"The second way is through three准王 (Provisional Kings) working together, using special methods to remove it. I learned this method early on but have never used it," Ji Jiuyou smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

"Thank you, Master!" Luo Tian bowed immediately, his eyes filled with deep gratitude. Ji Jiuyou, Dongbo Xin, and Gu Tianshu were three Provisional Kings—exactly what he needed.

"Don't get too excited. My method is feasible, but it's also demanding. It requires many auxiliary materials!" Ji Jiuyou spoke again, making Luo Tian's heart slightly cool.

"This is the auxiliary material. Other things I can help you find, but one thing—Bonesilk Bamboo—I've never seen before," Ji Jiuyou spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

Chapter 1542: Gu Tianshu Points the Way

"Bonesilk Bamboo, growing in places with many bones. Thousands of bones forge a spiritual bamboo!" Luo Tian recalled the description of Bonesilk Bamboo in his memory.

Bonesilk Bamboo, as its name suggests, only grows where there are many bones. Yet Luo Tian couldn't imagine any place with enough bones to nurture Bonesilk Bamboo.

The Yin Fish domain had many dry bones, but they hadn't nurtured Bonesilk Bamboo. Thus, Bonesilk Bamboo's rarity was even comparable to immortal herbs.

Luo Tian's face grew bitter. He hadn't yet gathered the ingredients for his curse-releasing medicine, and now he needed to find Bonesilk Bamboo. It was essential—otherwise Fu Xingxuan couldn't recover.

"Yes, it's Bonesilk Bamboo. First find it," Ji Jiuyou spoke softly, his eyes smiling.

"Also, this girl and the Qiandun Tower, as well as this immortal herb's boy, should stay here. I need to prepare many things. During this time, you go find it. As for the favor I asked of you, wait until you return," Ji Jiuyou spoke before Luo Tian could respond.

"This..." Upon hearing Ji Jiuyou's words, Luo Tian's face showed a bitter smile. He gazed at Xiao Gan.

Fu Xingxuan and the Qiandun Tower he could leave, but Xiao Gan—Luo Tian couldn't convince. After all, Xiao Gan had come out with Sun Mengru and hadn't recognized her as his master.

"Xiao Gan, stay here to keep your sister company, okay?" Seeing Luo Tian's dilemma, Fu Xingxuan smiled on her gray face and gazed at Xiao Gan.

"Okay!" Xiao Gan didn't hesitate, agreeing immediately. Evidently, he'd gotten along well with Fu Xingxuan in the Qiandun Tower.

"Stupid kid!" Sun Mengru watched Xiao Gan so quickly be won over by Fu Xingxuan, letting out a light snort.

"Now that these matters are resolved, the next step is to find Bonesilk Bamboo," Luo Tian spoke softly. He bowed to Ji Jiuyou and the others: "I entrust them to you."

"Wait for me!" Luo Tian then gazed at Fu Xingxuan, speaking softly. He was truly concerned about Fu Xingxuan.

"Ah, I'll wait for you to return," Fu Xingxuan's face also bore reluctance. Yet, thinking of her revival, she endured it.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian addressed Chen Zhanbiao and Leng Qiuchan, not wanting to waste more time. After all, if he entered a dangerous place to search, it might take centuries.

"Luo Tian!" As the three were about to move, Gu Tianshu's voice echoed in their ears. Their bodies paused, turning to look at Gu Tianshu with confusion.

"Go check the forbidden forest in the Shura Domain. I once saw Bonesilk Bamboo there when I self-annihilated. After these years, I don't know if it's still there," Gu Tianshu smiled, addressing Luo Tian. He didn't want Luo Tian to take too many detours.

"Good!" Upon hearing Gu Tianshu's words, Luo Tian's face lit up. Having some clues was much better than searching aimlessly.

"Go!" Gu Tianshu spoke softly, indicating Luo Tian could leave.

Luo Tian and the others bowed again to Gu Tianshu and the others, then their figures shimmered and vanished from the small world.

"Alright, this kid should be far away now. We should start," Ji Jiuyou smiled, gazing at Fu Xingxuan's soul standing there.

Upon hearing Ji Jiuyou's words, Gu Tianshu and Dongbo Xin stepped forward, surrounding Fu Xingxuan.

"Three... three elders, what are you doing?" Fu Xingxuan looked at the three surrounding her, eyes filled with confusion.

"Of course to save you!" Ji Jiuyou smiled, his ancient hands moving constantly. His broken sail also slowly unfurled.

"What!" Upon hearing Ji Jiuyou's words, Fu Xingxuan's gray face changed. Her gray eyes showed disbelief.

"Wait..." Fu Xingxuan was about to speak, but the broken sail instantly wrapped around her, enclosing her completely.

"Don't let that kid idle. He might not be motivated to do anything in the Tianyuan Continent," Ji Jiuyou smiled, then his hands formed complex seals. He instantly etched them onto the broken sail wrapping Fu Xingxuan.

Gu Tianshu and Dongbo Xin also chuckled, their hands forming divine laws. They etched them onto the broken sail.

After a full quarter of an hour, under the three's continuous etching, the broken sail covering Fu Xingxuan was filled with complex patterns. They flowed across it like a massive cocoon, emitting an astonishing aura.

"Kid, now it's your turn. Take a nap too!" Ji Jiuyou smiled, looking at Xiao Gan who was standing there in awe.

"Ah... you're all bad guys..." Xiao Gan immediately frightened by Ji Jiuyou and the others. His legs moved constantly, transforming into a streak of black light, flying toward where Luo Tian and the others had left.

"This speed!" Feeling Xiao Gan's speed, even Ji Jiuyou, Dongbo Xin, and Gu Tianshu's faces slightly changed.

"It's really a thorn in the side!" Gu Tianshu laughed, then waved his hand. The entire small world was sealed.

"Didn't escape?" Gu Tianshu's brows furrowed slightly, then addressed Ji Jiuyou and Dongbo Xin: "It definitely didn't escape this small world. Search for it!"

"Indeed, even we couldn't find his trace!" Dongbo Xin smiled, moving through the small world's starry sky to search.

"This little thing is too timid!" Ji Jiuyou smiled, three great masters playing hide-and-seek with the child-like soul of the immortal herb in the small world. If others saw this, they'd be shocked.

But as time passed, the three great masters' faces grew grim. They had searched for a quarter of an hour yet still couldn't find Xiao Gan.

What were these three great masters? They were the pillars of humanity, terrifying the ancient clans and making them gasp for breath. Yet now they were outwitted by a small child. If this became known, it would be disastrous.

"Little thing, I don't believe it!" Ji Jiuyou's old face trembled. He then split his forehead, revealing a gray eye.

"Found it!" Upon opening the third eye, Ji Jiuyou's face lit up. He then shimmered and vanished from his spot.

"Ah... big egghead... let me go..." Ji Jiuyou's voice echoed in the starry sky. As his words fell, he appeared before Gu Tianshu and Dongbo Xin, holding Xiao Gan.
