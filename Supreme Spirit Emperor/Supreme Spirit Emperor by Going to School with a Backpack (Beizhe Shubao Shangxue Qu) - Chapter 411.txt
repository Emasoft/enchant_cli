“Indeed, according to normal circumstances, Luo Tian’s injuries were severe. Yet with his abnormal physique, he should have recovered. Why are his wounds still present and healing so slowly?” Chen Zhanbiao’s words caused the others to turn their gazes toward Luo Tian. At that moment, he appeared no different from before his injury, prompting them to frown with concern.

“Could there have been a change of fate?” The others exchanged glances before approaching Luo Tian, scrutinizing him closely.

“Thunderous roars…” As they dispatched the three-headed dog, the grand hall returned to silence. They heard a series of resounding noises emanating from Luo Tian’s body.

“What is happening? Why is Luo Tian’s aura so chaotic?” Soon after, they noticed Luo Tian’s anomaly. Their expressions darkened further when they saw the mark on his neck glowing with an eerie cold light in the darkness, causing their hairs to stand on end and a chill to run through them.

“Could it be that the immortal spirit has begun its possession?” Their hearts grew heavy, their eyes fixed anxiously on Luo Tian.

“Only Luo Tian himself can save us; we are powerless!” The others sighed deeply, surrounding him.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s ashen face bore a fierce joy, watching the aura he had just destroyed by that divine light. His heart surged with exhilaration.

“Book of Epochs!” Luo Tian had not expected the Book of Epochs to act so suddenly, instantly annihilating the aura the immortal spirit had unleashed.

Luo Tian was overjoyed to the point of tears, while the immortal spirit truly wept. His gaze fell upon his own powerful attack, now reduced to nothing by that divine light. His eyes brimmed with shock.

“How is this possible!” The immortal spirit’s mind trembled. He had been certain no technique in the Nine Realms could block his attack.

“Thunderous roars…” However, as the immortal spirit was stunned, the golden ancient palace crashed down upon him with a deafening roar.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Luo Tian’s body seemed to emit the rumble of lightning, and an invisible wave of energy burst forth from his form. The group observing him—Sun Mengru and others—felt their hearts leap in alarm.

“What a battle must it be, that even we outside feel its pressure!” Xu Lizi yi’s face bore awe as he spoke.

“It must have been extremely arduous; perhaps Luo Tian was currently battling an immortal!” Cao Dezhu sighed deeply. His words left the others in silence.

A furious surge of energy swept before Luo Tian’s ashen soul, watching the immortal spirit destroyed by the ancient palace. A smile spread across Luo Tian’s ashen face, his heart exhaling a long breath. Even if that strike had not killed the immortal spirit, it would have certainly wounded him severely.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian relaxed slightly, golden divine light reappeared. The Book of Epochs emerged from his dantian into his line of sight, pressing a heavy pressure upon him.

“Rustle… rustle…” The golden pages flipped continuously, and waves of energy emanated from the Book of Epochs, enveloping Luo Tian.

As these waves spread, the powerful aura the immortal spirit had previously unleashed was slowly reassembling.

“I swear!” Luo Tian cursed, his ashen soul retreating instantly. His gaze was cautious toward the aura; he knew that if it had touched him, he would have been severely wounded.

Yet the Book of Epochs seemed to ignore Luo Tian entirely, emitting a strong suction from its golden pages. It absorbed the aura into itself before vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight, returning to his dantian like a noble.

“Master, at least leave me some broth!” Luo Tian watched the aura being absorbed by the Book of Epochs. He attempted to communicate with it through his spiritual awareness. He knew that if he had absorbed the aura, his soul would have greatly expanded, and his path might have become smoother. Perhaps he could even find the opportunity to ascend to immortality through this single thread of aura.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed under his breath, watching the Book of Epochs remain unresponsive. He sighed deeply, but regardless, it had saved him once more.

“What kind of existence are you? Even immortal aura is powerless before you!” Luo Tian muttered to himself.

“How could this be?” As Luo Tian mused, a weak aura slowly coalesced. The immortal spirit’s form appeared before Luo Tian’s eyes.

Yet this time, the immortal spirit no longer carried its former might; it was utterly exhausted, prompting a faint smile on Luo Tian’s ashen face.

“What is impossible?” Luo Tian’s expression was mocking as he addressed the immortal spirit, then took a step forward toward it.

“What is that thing!” The immortal spirit watched Luo Tian approaching, realizing his current state was too weak to fight. He abandoned resistance and spoke, his voice laced with deep resentment.

“His name is the Book of Epochs!” Luo Tian halted his movement, wanting to know if this immortal spirit was aware of the Book of Epochs.

“The Book of Epochs!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the immortal spirit’s voice was laced with disbelief. His golden eyes were filled with shock.

“I never expected to encounter the legendary Book of Epochs in this world. I yield; I never thought my plan was so perfect, yet it still failed. It must be fate—I shall not become a human!” The immortal spirit’s golden face bore defeat.

“Do you know of the Book of Epochs?” Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy, surprised that the immortal spirit was aware of its existence.

“Want to know? I’ll refuse to tell you. Fortunately, even if I had possessed you, it would have ultimately ended in death—just a matter of time!” The immortal spirit’s gaze held a hint of cruelty. He then extended his hand, and waves of energy radiated from it, affecting himself.

“He’s erasing his memories!” Luo Tian’s face changed drastically. He immediately dashed toward the immortal spirit.

“Stop!” Luo Tian roared, his current state leaving the immortal spirit defenseless. If he consumed it, his soul would grow stronger, and he might gain the immortal spirit’s memories. Perhaps this could reveal some clues about the Book of Epochs.

But Luo Tian’s speed was too late; as he reached the immortal spirit, its eyes turned bewildered.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian’s ashen face bore frustration. He struck the fragile immortal spirit with a punch.

“Boom…” Under Luo Tian’s powerful strike, the immortal spirit’s body shattered into soul energy, dispersing throughout Luo Tian’s form.

Chapter 1618: How Do You Prove It?

Luo Tian gazed at the immortal spirit, now scattered into soul energy. His face bore a sigh of admiration, and his heart was immensely relieved. Without the Book of Epochs, he might have truly faced death this time.

Yet despite the favorable outcome, the immortal spirit’s final words planted a thorn in Luo Tian’s heart. The Book of Epochs had changed his life, granting him immense opportunities and even saving him from death. Unknowingly, he had formed a karmic bond.

There was no such thing as a free meal; Luo Tian had always believed this. If he had survived multiple times, he must pay the same price.

“Better to focus on enhancing my strength!” Luo Tian shook his head. Though he did not know whether the Book of Epochs was a blessing or curse, he firmly believed that only with sufficient strength could he face any crisis. A strong fist was the ultimate truth.

“Unfortunately, your plan was perfect, but you never anticipated I had the Book of Epochs!” Luo Tian muttered lowly, without a trace of courtesy. His ashen soul sat cross-legged, beginning to absorb the soul energy left by the immortal spirit’s disintegration.

“Has it calmed down?” Outside, Cao Dezhu and others watched Luo Tian’s aura stabilize. His body no longer emitted any sound, and his wounds began to heal slowly. Their concern deepened.

“The Rebirth Immortal Seal is gone!” They soon noticed the mark on Luo Tian’s neck had vanished, their faces changing.

“Did the immortal spirit succeed in possession, or did Luo Tian…” Cao Dezhu began but stopped.

“Regardless, we should set up some precautions. Though we trust Luo Tian, the opponent might be a true immortal. We must remain cautious!” Wan Lingkong sighed softly and launched a golden array flag from his hand, surrounding Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” With the time to set up the array, Wan Lingkong’s strength was evident. The flags encircled Luo Tian, emitting divine laws. These intersected to form an invisible net. Wan Lingkong was confident that even a near-Era Master or near-Warlord would be trapped within this array.

Time passed slowly, a day slipping by as the group anxiously waited. Luo Tian remained seated, his wounds healing gradually, and his aura steadily growing stronger.

“Exhilarating!” Luo Tian continuously absorbed the soul energy left by the immortal spirit’s disintegration. After a day, he had consumed most of it. His soul finally returned to its peak state.

Though the immortal spirit’s divine aura had been largely taken by the Book of Epochs, a small portion remained. Though minimal, it still had an effect. Now, Luo Tian’s soul carried a faint divine light, no longer ashen.

“Unfortunately, it is too little! If I could fully absorb and refine it, perhaps I truly would find the opportunity to ascend!” Luo Tian sighed deeply before continuing to absorb the remaining soul energy.

“Luo Tian’s aura is rising!” As Luo Tian refined it again, Sun Mengru and others watched his aura ascend. Yet instead of joy, their expressions darkened further.

“Wan Lingkong, once Luo Tian awakens, immediately activate the array to trap him!” Sun Mengru’s eyes flashed coldness. She had made a decision.

“Understood.” Wan Lingkong nodded. As Sun Mengru, Luo Tian’s wife, had spoken, how could he refuse? He knew that among them, Sun Mengru felt the most pain. Her husband was at a critical moment, and she could do nothing to help.

“Buzz…” As the group anxiously waited, three more days passed. Luo Tian’s aura grew stronger, a spiritual pressure making Sun Mengru and others’ faces more solemn.

“Hope Luo Tian has not changed!” They prayed silently, but they knew he was likely in danger. His soul had never been this strong before; its sudden surge made their souls unstable, indicating something strange.

Luo Tian, however, was unaware of the group’s concern for him or their belief that he had been possessed. His ashen soul bore a smile, its entire body now wrapped in golden light.

“Finally completed!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, feeling his soul had ascended another level. Knowing he had consumed the immortal spirit, he realized his soul had now reached the stage of a near-Era Master.

“Now my body surpasses near-Era Masters, and so does my soul. Once the Wheel of Rebirth in my dantian fully forms, those ancient royal clan near-Warlords would be helpless before me. Even the offspring of true Warlords, if they achieved near-Warlord status, would struggle to resist me!” Luo Tian’s golden face bore fierce confidence.

“However, those Warlord offspring are not simple. I wonder if their strength would match that of a young Warlord or Era Master!” Luo Tian’s face bore anticipation, eager to fight those prodigies.

“They must have finished off the three-headed dog by now, right?” Luo Tian smiled and then his golden soul expanded, merging with his body. He slowly opened his eyes.

“Awakened!” Sun Mengru and others noticed as Luo Tian opened his eyes, their gazes tense.

“Buzz…” An invisible pressure radiated from Luo Tian’s body. Even a near-Era Master would have difficulty against him now, causing Cao Dezhu and others to feel pressure.

“Wan Lingkong, act!” Seeing Luo Tian’s eyes flash with divine light, Cao Dezhu and others shouted at Wan Lingkong.

“Buzz…” No need for their words; as soon as Luo Tian opened his eyes, Wan Lingkong’s array flags fell instantly, plunging into the front of Luo Tian.

Divine light interwove with divine laws, forming a vast net that enveloped Luo Tian. It wrapped around his body.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian had no time to react, immediately entangled by the golden net. He was stunned but quickly guessed their intentions and smiled softly.

“It’s me!” Luo Tian spoke quietly, not struggling. He knew Wan Lingkong’s array was powerful; even now, he would find it difficult to break free quickly.

Cao Dezhu and others watched Luo Tian’s smile, sensing its depth. Their faces changed instantly.

“Damn it! How dare you possess Luo Tian!” Their eyes turned red, and terrifying martial techniques凝聚 in their hands. The Heavenly Thunder Sword radiated overwhelming power, hovering above them. If they detected anything amiss with Luo Tian, they would not hesitate to unleash it.

“Damn…” Luo Tian watched the Heavenly Thunder Sword hovering above them, its overwhelming aura causing his face to change. If he were killed by these bastards, it would be a tragic death.

“Don’t act rashly; I am truly Luo Tian!” Though bound, Luo Tian could still move slightly. He waved at them urgently.

“I don’t believe it. How can you prove you are Luo Tian?” Cao Dezhu’s face bore disdain, showing no relaxation.

“How can I prove it…” Upon hearing Cao Dezhu’s words, Luo Tian’s mouth twitched. This was absurd—he had to prove he was himself.

“Tell me, how should I prove it?” Luo Tian shook his head. He didn’t know how to prove it, for if he were truly possessed, the immortal spirit would be another version of himself.

“First, don’t resist; let us seal you first!” Wan Lingkong spoke to Luo Tian, his voice heavy.

“Right, let us seal you first; everything else can wait!” Upon hearing Wan Lingkong’s words, Cao Dezhu and others nodded in agreement. Even Sun Mengru gave a nod.

“Fine… fine… fine… now you are the masters…” Luo Tian’s face bore a bitter smile, not resisting as he stood there.

“Buzz…” Seeing Luo Tian’s nod, they showed no mercy and immediately acted. Colorful seals flew from their hands, layer after layer of sealing power enveloping Luo Tian. His dantian became dormant, and even his blood and soul were sealed.

“This should be enough!” Luo Tian’s face bore a bitter smile, his gaze on Cao Dezhu and others. His mind sneered: “Once I recover, I’ll deal with you!”

“This is enough, but it still doesn’t prove anything!” The group then looked troubled. They couldn’t determine whether the current Luo Tian was genuine or not.

“Here’s an idea,” Wan Lingkong then smiled and whispered into their minds.

“This…” Upon hearing Wan Lingkong’s whisper, the group’s faces turned troubled. They then looked at Luo Tian.

“We’ve thought of a way; you must cooperate with us!” Cao Dezhu and others said, their mouths twitching.

“Cooperate? Whatever you say!” Luo Tian replied, unaware of what scheme these bastards had concocted.

“Dog, why don’t you try first?” The group then turned their gaze to Cao Dezhu, their eyes filled with encouragement.

“F*** it! Why me? I’ve already suffered enough!” Upon seeing their gazes, Cao Dezhu’s face changed.

“You know Luo Tian isn’t reliable; he’ll definitely miss!” Zheng Xin encouraged, his voice laced with encouragement.

“No… I can’t…” Cao Dezhu shook his head, shouting at them: “Why me! I won’t do it, Zheng Xin, you should try!”

“You are who? The second-ranked prodigy of the Demon Region, who has defeated Era Masters! Master Cao Dezhu, this matter is yours alone!”

“You are great, you are supreme, you are mighty! This small task is but a breeze for you!” Zheng Xin saw Cao Dezhu’s hesitation and flattered him.

“Indeed, you are the only one among us who could fight Luo Tian! This is your responsibility!” Others also spoke, praising Cao Dezhu.

Luo Tian bore a puzzled expression, unaware of what these bastards were scheming. He stood there waiting for their decision.

Cao Dezhu, flattered by the group’s praise, bore a smug expression. He crossed his arms and radiated a lonely aura.

“Unfortunately, Luo Tian’s current state makes me feel somewhat lonely,” Cao Dezhu muttered softly, his voice laced with a touch of loneliness.

“Supreme Master Cao Dezhu, look at what we discussed; do you think it’s your turn to act?” Zheng Xin watched Cao Dezhu enter his state and incited him.

“Small matter, I…” Cao Dezhu was about to agree but then trembled. He looked at Zheng Xin and others.

“Damn it, I almost fell for it!” Cao Dezhu gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with intense anger.

“Thankfully I reacted in time!” Cao Dezhu felt relieved, almost having agreed.

“Let’s all do it; whoever is pointed at will be the one!” Cao Dezhu then turned his eyes, addressing Zheng Xin and others.

“Okay!” Seeing Cao Dezhu hadn’t fallen for it, the group felt a bit regretful. They then decided to stand outside Luo Tian’s reach, looking at him.

“I’ll stay here; Luo Tian’s medical skills are extraordinary. His acupuncture is divine. If he can pierce any of our Wind-Flushing points, it will confirm his identity!” Zheng Xin spoke to Luo Tian.

Wan Lingkong’s face bore satisfaction, believing his plan was feasible. If Luo Tian could pierce their Wind-Flushing points, it would prove he was fake. After all, a true Luo Tian would never hit them. This was something Cao Dezhu had experienced.

If Luo Tian were truly possessed, his acupuncture would change—this was an essential difference. This was why the group had hesitated to push Cao Dezhu forward.

“You damn bastards, are you deliberately provoking me!” Upon hearing their words, Luo Tian’s face changed. He naturally knew how strong his acupuncture was; the group’s request was too difficult for him.

“Don’t waste time, hurry up! If you miss, we won’t be kind!” The group’s faces bore mockery as they spoke. They loosened a bit of Luo Tian’s seal, allowing him to recover some movement.

“I’ll try my best,” Luo Tian smiled bitterly. If he missed, they might kill him, which would be a tragic death.

“Buzz…” Acupuncture needles appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. He focused on Zheng Xin, having long wanted to test Luo Tian. Now he had the chance and wouldn’t miss it.

As soon as Luo Tian took out the needles, Cao Dezhu, Xu Lizi yi, and Yan Jun’s bodies instinctively trembled.

“Damn!” Zheng Xin watched Luo Tian focus on him, his face trembling. He then spoke: “Change someone else; you won’t hit me!”

“Don’t worry, all of you are included!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth. Cold light appeared between his fingers. Each finger had a glint of coldness.

Luo Tian scanned the group before locking onto Zheng Xin, Cao Dezhu, Xu Lizi yi, and Sun Kemin.

“Bastards, wait!” Luo Tian’s eyes fixed on the four, his face bearing a serious expression. He aimed at their Wind-Flushing points and waved his hand.

“Buzz…” Four glints of coldness flashed, causing the others to feel a chill. However, they remained still, allowing the silver coldness to approach them.

“Yikes… yikes…” The next moment, four cries of pain echoed in the dark space.

“Huh? We are…” Chen Zhanbiao spoke awkwardly, his eyes flashing relief. He looked around and saw the four lying on the ground.

“I swear, why is it always me!” Cao Dezhu stood up, his forehead had a silver needle. He pulled it out while convulsing and looked at Luo Tian.

Xu Lizi yi, Sun Kemin, and Zheng Xin also stood up from the ground, pulling out the needles.

“You damned luckless bastard! Don’t drag us into it!” Xu Lizi yi’s mouth twitched. The needle Luo Tian had shot almost severed his lineage.

Thinking back to the previous time when the Heavenly Thunder Sword flew between his legs, and now this one, Xu Lizi yi had been nearly castrated by Luo Tian twice.

“I didn’t say a word!”

Thinking of this, Xu Lizi yi’s face bore intense resentment. He looked at Luo Tian like a wronged wife.

“I didn’t do it on purpose…” Luo Tian rubbed his nose, his face bearing embarrassment. But soon he was surrounded by the group.

“You’re not Luo Tian!” Cao Dezhu’s face bore a faint smile as he approached Luo Tian.

“Indeed, you are not Luo Tian! Brothers, attack!” Sun Kemin and others bore fierce smiles, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it, I am Luo Tian… I swear, you’re retaliating!” The next moment, Luo Tian’s cry echoed in the dark hall.

“I knew you’d be fine!” Sun Mengru’s eyes glistened, her face bearing a smile. She watched Luo Tian being beaten by Cao Dezhu and others.

“You damn bastards!” Luo Tian, surrounded by them, felt a smile in their eyes and finally relaxed his heart.

The group fought for a quarter of an hour, and Luo Tian emerged with bruises and swelling.

“Pleasant!” Cao Dezhu and others bore a sigh of relief, but their eyes were excited. Not for anything else, but Luo Tian’s acupuncture alone proved it was truly him.

“Damn it, now can you unseal me!” Luo Tian, bruised and swollen, gritted his teeth as he looked at them.

“No, you must promise not to retaliate!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the group shook their heads. They wouldn’t miss this opportunity to exploit Luo Tian; it was a once-in-a-century chance.

“Damn bastards…” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, looking at their faces with a difficult expression. He then looked at Sun Mengru.

“Mengru, help me unseal it!” Luo Tian’s face bore a fawning smile, his eyes pitifully looking at Sun Mengru.

“Not helping; you deserve it!” But Sun Mengru’s words made Luo Tian grimace. He hadn’t expected her to say that.

“Speak up, what are your conditions!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth at them.

“No more acupuncture toward me… no retaliation…” Each condition was spoken by the group. Luo Tian, forced to agree, gritted his teeth and accepted them all.

After the group set many unreasonable conditions, they finally unsealed Luo Tian. Their gazes turned to him.

“You bastards!” Luo Tian looked at them, but his heart was deeply moved; he had almost lost them.

“Huh… why is it so fragrant…” As Luo Tian was about to curse them, a wave of meaty aroma entered their noses. Their gazes turned toward Chen Zhanbiao, who had been observing the pot.

“Gurgle…” The water in the pot continuously boiled, and waves of mist rose from it. Divine light emerged from the water, making Luo Tian and others look surprised.

Chapter 1620: Submission to a Master

“Big brother, release the seven-colored flame; I’ve been starving for half a day!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke to Luo Tian, wanting to speed up the process.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded, a smile on his face. The only one who hadn’t attacked him was Chen Zhanbiao; Luo Tian secretly sighed that Chen Zhanbiao was the best.

The seven-colored flame flew from Luo Tian’s mouth and landed under the pot, instantly spreading a terrifying temperature throughout the dark hall.

“Gurgle…” As the seven-colored flame continuously heated, the water in the pot boiled more vigorously. The aroma filled their noses. Even though they no longer needed to eat, they were still drawn by the scent, and their stomachs growled.

“This black dog doesn’t look good, but its meat is so fragrant! It must be very nourishing; eating it would surely boost our cultivation!” Cao Dezhu and others’ faces bore greed as they looked at the pieces of dog meat flipping in the boiling water.

“Haha, good!” Not long after, Chen Zhanbiao smiled awkwardly and took out a piece of dog meat from the pot. He blew on it before putting it in his mouth.

“Buzz…” Waves of energy echoed from Chen Zhanbiao’s mouth. As he swallowed the meat, a series of roaring sounds echoed in his body, causing his face to flush slightly.

“Chen Zhanbiao’s cultivation has increased!” The group watched his aura rise slightly, as if his blood and qi had been ignited. They felt a powerful aura.

“This meat is good!” Seeing Chen Zhanbiao’s aura rising, Cao Dezhu and others’ eyes lit up. They immediately took out the three-headed dog’s meat from the pot, starting to eat it. Even Luo Tian was no exception.

“Damn good!” Upon taking a bite, they all bore an intoxicated expression, their eyes greedy. They took more meat from the pot.

“Damn it, dog! You eat your own kind; you’re a beast!”

“Motherf***er, if you say I’m a dog again, I’ll fight you!”

“You two go fight each other!” They continued to scuffle. Not long after, they finished off the three-headed dog’s meat in the pot.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Roars echoed from their bodies. Their faces bore satisfaction, redness, and surging qi.

“You guys are too much!” Chen Zhanbiao wiped his lips, gazing at them with a sorrowful look. These bastards ate so quickly they were no slower than him, making Chen Zhanbiao feel心疼. He had spent so much time cutting and guarding the three-headed dog’s meat, but it ended up in others’ stomachs.

“I can’t eat anymore; this stuff is too nourishing, I need to take it slowly!” Cao Dezhu and others continued to refine the pure energy in their bodies.

“This is truly a good thing!” Luo Tian practiced his Wheel of Rebirth technique, sitting cross-legged. His eyes bore admiration as the chaotic energy in his body was quickly refined into pure cultivation, appearing in his dantian. This made the Wheel of Rebirth in his dantian grow slightly again.

Not long after, everyone opened their eyes and looked at the three-headed dog’s corpse in the darkness.

This was no small matter; their faces changed instantly, filled with disbelief.

Their eyes saw the three-headed dog, now standing up. Its three heads slowly grew, and six silver eyes stared at Luo Tian and others. They couldn’t help but draw a cold breath.

“How is this possible!” Cao Dezhu spoke in shock, his voice laced with trembling. They had personally killed the three-headed dog and felt it was lifeless, so they had boldly refined its meat.

They never expected the three-headed dog to revive after being seemingly dead, and now it was staring at them.

“My god! If this thing had attacked us…” Their bodies broke out in cold sweat. They didn’t know when the three-headed dog had revived, and they hadn’t been prepared. If it had attacked them, they would have suffered heavy losses.

“Back!” Luo Tian roared at the group and immediately stood in front of them, his Heavenly Thunder Sword reappearing in his hand.

“Ugh…” Seeing the Heavenly Thunder Sword, the three-headed dog took two steps back, its eyes filled with fear.

“No hostility?” Luo Tian felt something was off. He didn’t sense any hostility from the three-headed dog, no longer as fierce as before. Just as they had thought, if the three-headed dog had attacked them while they were recovering, they would have suffered heavy losses.

“Ugh…” As Luo Tian pondered, the three-headed dog let out more groans. Its three massive heads lowered toward Luo Tian, and its eyes—once filled with coldness—now showed longing.

“What’s going on? I feel this dog is begging you!” Zheng Xin looked puzzled and spoke his feelings.

“Ugh… ugh…” The three-headed dog let out more groans, looking at Luo Tian with longing.

“Dog, translate!” Zheng Xin and others spoke to Cao Dezhu, believing he could understand.

“He wants Luo Tian to take him in!” Cao Dezhu’s face bore a hint of annoyance. He glared at them but relayed the three-headed dog’s meaning to Luo Tian.

“Submits to me as his master?” Upon hearing Cao Dezhu’s translation, Luo Tian’s face bore confusion. He looked at the three-headed dog.

“Ugh…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the three massive heads nodded, their eyes filled with longing toward Luo Tian.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian’s face was confused. He hadn’t expected the three-headed dog to change so quickly; it had previously wanted to tear them apart, but now it wished to submit. This contrast was too great.

However, he soon understood: he had consumed the immortal spirit’s soul energy. Essentially, his body also carried some of the immortal spirit’s aura. In the three-headed dog’s eyes, he was indeed its master.

“Hmph, will I have free dog meat hotpot now? This thing’s meat is truly nourishing!” Their eyes gleamed, looking at the three-headed dog as if it were pure cultivation.
