Chapter One: The Chronicle of the Epoch


On the Tianyuan Continent, Feiyun Sect.


A group of youths in gray robes pushed a slender young man out of the sect's gates, throwing him to the ground. One leader sneered down at him: "Luo Tian, your audacity is astounding. A mere First Stage of Body Refinement cultivator dares to offend Master Li? You clearly don't know how to write 'death'!"


Luo Tian gritted his teeth, painfully rising. His eyes burned with hatred as he memorized each face of those who had mocked him. He vowed to remember every one of them.


"Tell Wang Fan to relay this: if I ever rise again, I'll repay him tenfold!" Luo Tian's voice was as cold as ice, yet his eyes blazed with fury. Wang Fan shivered.


"An injured wretch wants revenge? Next life, maybe!" Wang Fan snorted, angering him. Yet his "next life" was sincere—Luo Tian was doomed.


Master Li Xiuping wasn't merciful. Once he'd struck, there would be no mercy.


Wang Fan and the others left, the gates closing behind them. Luo Tian stood alone, battered and broken.


He gazed at the closed gates, recalling his recent torment. His fists clenched so hard that his nails dug into his palms. He whispered a name: Chen Yunting.


Chen Yunting had been Luo Tian's childhood companion, both chosen by Feiyun Sect. But after entering the sect, she betrayed him for Master Li Xiuping. Luo Tian was crippled and expelled for offending Li Xiuping. He never understood why the girl he'd grown up with changed so drastically.


In one day, his dreams of love, immortality, and martial cultivation all shattered. He became a broken man with no strength left—only hatred.


"Chen Yunting, you've forsaken me! From now on, we're strangers. Li Xiuping, you crippled my cultivation—this grudge I'll never forget! Feiyun Sect, your injustice will one day make you regret this!" Luo Tian roared, vowing vengeance.


He gazed longingly at the gates before descending into Da'an Forest, determined to find a chance to heal his shattered meridians.


Da'an Forest was vast and treacherous, filled with beasts and hidden opportunities. If he failed here, on the Tianyuan Continent where strength ruled, even survival would be uncertain.


Luo Tian moved cautiously, avoiding the forest's dangers. Yet after an hour, he found no beasts—unusual for this place. The silence was eerie; even his breath echoed.


"Could something have happened here?" he mused, but this was his best chance. Normally, he couldn't have ventured so deep.


He spotted a frozen pool, "Wangyou Tan" (Desolate Abyss). It was a forbidden place—those who entered were instantly frozen. No one had ever escaped.


As Luo Tian hesitated, a mocking voice echoed behind him: "Kid, you've chosen a fine tomb!"


He turned to see two guards. One sneered: "Li Xiuping sent you?"


"Congratulations, you're right," the tall guard smirked. "But I'll torment you anyway—my report needs proof!"


"Li Xiuping sent two Second Stage Body Refinement cultivators to kill me, a broken man? He must respect me," Luo Tian seethed.


"Enough talk! Let me have fun first!" the fat guard grinned, advancing like a cat toying with prey.


The tall guard chuckled: "Be careful, his body's weak!"


Luo Tian's skin crawled. He hated Chen Yunting, Feiyun Sect, Li Xiuping, and his own weakness. "I'd rather die than be humiliated!" He leapt into the frozen pool.


The fat guard cursed, but dared not follow. The tall guard sighed: "He's dead. Let's go." They left.


The pool's cold seeped into Luo Tian's bones. He struggled to stay conscious but was frozen, losing consciousness.


Suddenly, a force pulled him into the pool's depths. There, alongside an iron-backed wolf and a five-colored deer—both frozen—the golden book "Chronicle of the Epoch" emerged, radiating light. It absorbed the wolf's blood, then the deer's, before enveloping Luo Tian in golden light. The book pierced his head.


Meanwhile, Da'an Forest trembled. Beasts cowered in fear as the sky darkened, rain poured, and the pool's ice melted.


In Tianyuan City, a white-haired elder watched the forest, eyes alight: "Spirit energy turned to rain! Three thousand years have passed—finally found you, the Chronicle of the Epoch!" He vanished without a trace.


The beasts' night was restless, but the true catalyst slept silently, changing.


Chapter Two: Tianyuan City


Morning sun rose, casting golden light through the forest. Luo Tian awoke, finding himself at the pool's bottom—now just a damp pit. His injuries were healed; his meridians restored. He'd even advanced to Second Stage Body Refinement.


"Impossible!" he marveled, checking his body. His elemental energy was now fivefold—earth, wood, water, fire, metal. This made him a rare Five-Element Body.


He clenched his fists: "Li Xiuping, you never expected me to survive. I'll give you a surprise!"


He examined his mind and found the golden book "Chronicle of the Epoch" in his consciousness. It had granted him a legendary technique, Five-Element Cultivation Art.


The book's power was immense. Luo Tian vowed to keep it secret, knowing its value could ignite the continent.


He practiced the technique, absorbing spirit energy. His cultivation surged rapidly.


But Da'an Forest was too dangerous. He left for Tianyuan City, where Li Xiuping's family resided.


In the city, Luo Tian overheard a nobleman demanding a poor mother and daughter: "If you become my twelfth concubine, I'll heal your mother!"


Luo Tian's eyes flashed. The guards were the same ones who'd forced him into the pool. He stepped forward, mocking: "Are all Li family men so shameless?"


The nobleman, Li Xiuran, was stunned. "You dare interfere?!" He pushed Luo Tian, who dodged and tripped him.


Li Xiuran ordered his guards: "Kill him!"


The guards recognized Luo Tian, shocked he'd survived the pool. The fat guard sneered: "You're still alive?!"


Luo Tian's fist, wrapped in golden energy, struck the fat guard's abdomen, crippling him. The tall guard attacked but was defeated by Luo Tian's five-element strength.


The crowd gasped at Luo Tian's power. He then confronted Li Xiuran, who fled. A middle-aged man intervened, striking Luo Tian with a Fourth Stage Body Refinement attack.


Luo Tian's strength was Second Stage, but this man's power was overwhelming. He barely defended.


"Master Li Yuande," the crowd murmured. The man's power was undeniable.


Luo Tian's resolve hardened: "I'll face the Li family, no matter the cost."
